BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Inflammation plays a fundamental role in host defenses and the progression of immune-mediated disease. The inflammatory response is initiated in response to injury (e.g. trauma, ischemia, and foreign particles) and infection (e.g. bacterial or viral infection) by multiple events, including chemical mediators (e.g. cytokines<br><br><br>
and prostaglandins) and inflammatory cells (e.g. leukocytes). It is characterized by increased blood flow to the tissue, causing pyrexia, erythema, induration and pain.<br>
A delicate well-balanced interplay between the humoral and cellular immune elements in the inflammatory response enables the elimination of harmful agents and the initiation of the repair of damaged tissue. When this delicately balanced interplay is disrupted, the inflammatory response may result in considerable damage to normal tissue and may be more harmful than the original insult that initiated the reaction. In these cases of uncontrolled inflammatory responses, clinical intervention is needed to prevent tissue damage and organ dysfunction. Diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, Crohn's disease, asthma, allergies, septic shock syndrome, atherosclerosis, inflammatory bowel disease among other clinical conditions are characterized by chronic inflammation.<br>
Cytokines, especially IL-1p, IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-a, play an important role in the inflammatory process.<br>
TNF-a, a pleiotropic cytokine, is produced mainly by macrophages, but it may be produced by other types of cells also. TNF-a demonstrates beneficial as well as pathological activities. It has both growth stimulating effects and growth inhibitory properties, besides being self-regulatory. The beneficial functions of TNF-a include maintaining homeostasis by regulating the body's circadian rhythm, mounting an immune response to bacterial, viral, fungal and parasitic infections, replacing or remodeling injured tissue by stimulating fibroblast growth and as the name suggests, killing certain tumors.<br>
Although TNF-a plays a critical role in innate and acquired immune responses, inappropriate production of TNF-a can produce pathological changes resulting in chronic inflammation and tissue damage. TNF-a has been shown to play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of many chronic inflammatory disease such as inflammatory bowel disease, rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, osteoarthritis, refractory rheumatoid arthritis, chronic non-rheumatoid   arthritis,   osteoporosis/bone   resorption,   coronary   heart  disease,<br><br><br>
vasculitis, ulcerative colitis, psoriasis, adult respiratory distress syndrome, diabetes, skin delayed type hypersensitivity disorders and Alzheimer's disease. lnterleukin-1 (IL-1) is an important part of the innate immune system, which regulates functions of the adaptive immune system. The balance between IL-1 and IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra) in local tissues influences the possible development of an inflammatory disease and resultant structural damage. In the presence of an excess amount of IL-1, inflammatory and autoimmune disorders may be developed in joints, lungs, gastrointestinal tract, central nervous system (CNS) or blood vessels.<br>
Among various inflammatory disorders, rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disorder. RA is a chronic, systemic, articular inflammatory disease of unknown etiology. In RA, the normally thin synovial lining of joints is replaced by an inflammatory, highly vascularized, invasive fibrocollagenase tissue (pannus), which is destructive to both cartilage and bone. Areas that may be affected include the joints of the hands, wrists, neck, jaw, elbows, knee, feet and ankles. Cartilage destruction in RA is linked to aberrant cytokines and growth factor expression in the affected joints.<br>
Two clinically important cytokines released in the synovium are IL-1 p and TNF-a. TNF-a can upregulate its own expression as well as facilitate the expression of other genes implicated in RA, including IL-1 p, IL-6, IL-8, cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), inducible nitric oxide synthetase (iNOS), intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), vascular-cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1), and E-Selectin. This type of positive regulatory loop may amplify and perpetuate local inflammatory responses. Therefore, the inappropriate or over-expression of TNF-a leads to a coordinated increase in the expression of many genes whose products mediate inflammatory and immune responses and thereby lead to the clinical manifestations of RA.<br>
The recruitment and retention of leukocytes is a critical event in the pathogenesis of all chronic inflammatory disorders including RA. Moreover, the adhesion of circulating leukocytes, especially monocytes, to vascular endothelium is also a crucial event in the development of atherosclerosis. This process depends on the<br><br><br>
interaction between the adhesion molecules expressed on the surface of endothelial cells such as ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and E-Selectin and their cognate ligands on leukocytes. Hence, ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and E-Selectin are responsible for the recruitment of inflammatory cells, such as neutrophils, eosinophils, and T lymphocytes, from the circulation to the site of inflammation. These adhesion proteins are normally at low level on the endothelial cell surface but are greatly induced by various proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-a.<br>
The most common therapy for treatment of inflammatory disorders involves use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) e.g. naproxen, diclofenac, ibuprofen to alleviate symptoms such as pain. However, despite the widespread use of NSAIDs, many individuals cannot tolerate the doses necessary to treat the disorder over a prolonged period of time as NSAIDs are known to cause gastric erosions. Moreover, NSAIDs merely treat the symptoms of disorder and not the cause.<br>
When patients fail to respond to NSAIDs, other drugs such as methotrexate, gold salts, D-penicillamine and corticosteroids are used. These drugs also have significant toxic effects.<br>
Monoclonal antibody drugs such as infliximab, etanercept and adalimumab are useful as anti-inflammatory agents, but have drawbacks such as route of administration (only parenteral), high cost, allergy induction, activation of latent tuberculosis, increased risk of cancer and congestive heart disease.<br>
Hence, there is a need for the development of improved and alternative medicaments with reduced side effects for the prevention and treatment of inflammatory disorders caused by increased IL-1 and TNF-a .<br>
Herbs have been known and used throughout the world for treatment of many conditions. There is evidence that products derived from plants have potential pharmacological and therapeutic effects on mammals and tend to have less deleterious side effects than synthetic drugs.<br><br><br>
The present invention describes a novel herbal composition, which comprises extract of flowering and fruiting heads of the plant, Sphaeranthus indicus. The composition can be used for treatment of various inflammatory disorders with minimal side effects.<br>
Sphaeranthus indicus is a common weed found in rice fields. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and in the literature of Ayurveda, it is known as mahamundi or gorakhmundi. The plant, available throughout India, is a branched herb with purple flowers. It is used in hepatic and gastric disorders. It is used in folk medicine as a remedy for various ailments including dysentery, pain in the uterus and vagina, diseases of the chest, purification and enrichment of blood, urinary tract infections, wound healing and several other diseases.<br>
A polyherbal formulation "RV-08", containing Sphaeranthus indicus has been developed with a view to counteract immunodeficient disorders (Indian Journal of Pharmacology, 33, 454-55, (2001)).<br>
Isolation of a new sesquiterpene glycoside, sphaeranthanolide, from the flowers of Sphaeranthus indicus has been reported. The isolated compound, Sphaeranthanolide, exhibited immunostimulating activity. (Phytochemistry, 29(8), 2573-76, (1990)).<br>
Immunomodulatory activity of methanol extract of flower-heads of Sphaeranthus indicus has been reported (Ars Pharmaceutica 45:3; 281-91, (2004)).<br>
The aqueous extract obtained from roots of Sphaeranthus indicus is reported to be moderately active in down-regulating Propionibacterium acnes induced TNF-a and IL-8 production. Sphaeranthus indicus caused a smaller, still significant suppression of reactive oxygen species (Phytomedicine, 10(1), 34-38, (2003)).<br>
To our knowledge, there is no report of any medicament containing extract of flowering and fruiting heads of Sphaeranthus indicus for treatment of inflammatory disorders. To overcome the problems of side effects of present line of treatment, such as allergy induction, activation of latent tuberculosis, myelosuppression, increased risk of cancer and congestive heart disease, associated with the prior<br><br><br>
art compositions, the present inventors have prepared a novel herbal composition effective against inflammation, having inhibitory activity against TNF-a, interleukins (IL-1, IL-6, IL-8) and the expression of intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), vascular-cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1), and E-Selectin. The compositions of the present invention can also be used in combination with at least one other anti-inflammatory agent.<br>

Example 5<br>
Primary screening - Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (hPBMCs).TNF-a production  by lipopolysaccharides (LPS)  in  hPBMCs was measured according to the method described by Jansky, L. et al (Physiol. Res. 52: 593-598, (2003)). Blood was collected from healthy donors into Potassium EDTA vacutainer<br><br><br>
tubes (BD vacutainer). The PBMCs were isolated using gradient centrifugation in Histopaque-1077 solution (Sigma). Isolated PBMCs were suspended in RPMI 1640 culture medium (Gibco BRL, Pasley, UK) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Hyclone, Utah, USA), 100 m/ml penicillin (Sigma Chemical Co. St Louis, MO) and 100 ng/ml streptomycin (Sigma Chemical Co. St Louis, MO). The cell concentration was adjusted to 1x106 cells/ml. The viability as determined by trypan blue dye exclusion was uniformly &gt;98%. The cell suspension (100 ml) was added to the wells of a 96-well culture plate. Following cell plating, 79 ml of the culture medium and 1 ml of eight different concentrations of the test samples (final concentration 0.03, 0.1, 0.3, 1, 3, 10, 30, 100 ug/ml) dissolved in DMSO (dimethylsulfoxide, Sigma, MO, USA) were added to the cells. The final concentration of DMSO was adjusted to 0.5%. The vehicle (0.5% DMSO) was used as control. Rolipram (100, 300 fxM) was used as a standard. The plates were incubated for 30 min at 37°C in an atmosphere of 5% C02. Finally, 20 nl (10 ng/ml) per well of LPS, (Escherchia coli 0127:B8, Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO) was added, for a final concentration of 1 ug/ml. The plates were incubated at 37°C for 5 h in an atmosphere of 5% CO2. To assess the cytotoxic effect of the plant extracts, the cellular viability test was performed using MTS (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfonyl)-2H-tetrazolium) reagent after 5 h of incubation. Supernatants were harvested and assayed for TNF-a by ELISA as described by the manufacturer (OptiEIA ELISA sets, BD Biosciences, Pharmingen). The % inhibition was recorded. Percent cytotoxicity of the test samples compared to control was evaluated.<br>

Cell Culture and Reagents:<br>
Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells (HUVECs) were obtained from Cascade Biologies and were maintained in M200 (Cascade Biologies, Portland, Or) supplemented with low serum growth supplement (LSGS) at 37°C in a 5% C02 incubator. U937 cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA) were grown in the RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS (Hyclone, Logan, UT). Recombinant human TNFa, antibodies to VCAM-1, ICAM-1, E-Selectin were obtained from R&amp;D Systems and LPS was obtained from Sigma (St. Louis, MO).<br>
Cell-ELISA for adhesion molecule expression<br>
HUVECs were plated at 7 x 105 cells/well in 96-well fibronectin coated plates. The cells were stimulated with TNF-a (10 ng/ml) or LPS (1 ug/ml), 30 min after addition of test compound. After stimulation, cells (E-Selectin and ICAM-1) were fixed with paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffer saline (PBS). Non specific binding was blocked by 2% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in phosphate buffer saline (PBS) for 1 h, and the cells were incubated with primary antibody for 2 h. For detection of VCAM-1 the cells were blocked, incubated with primary antibody overnight, and then fixed. The cells were washed with 0.1% BSA in PBS, and incubated with peroxidase-conjugated antibody (Ab) to mouse immunoglobulin G (IgG) was added for 90 min. After washing, seven times, 3,3'5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine liquid substrate (TMB substrate) was added and the optical<br><br><br>
density of each well was determined at 450 nm using a microtitre plate reader (Spectramax, Molecular Devices, CA). BAY 11-7082 [(E)-3-(4-methylphenylsulfonyl)-2-propenenitrile] was used as a standard and DMSO as vehicle control. Percent inhibition of the test sample compared to the control is evaluated. The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) values for each sample compared to control are determined by a non-linear regression method. The results are summarized in table 5.<br>

Adhesion of THP-1 Mononuclear Cells to HUVEC Monolayers<br>
Adhesion studies were performed with the promonocytic cell line THP-1, which has been established as a useful model for monocytes in adhesion studies in Circ. Res., 97, 236-243, 2005, with modifications. THP-1 cells were washed twice with labeling medium (M200 plus LSGS). THP-1 cells (6x105 cells per ml) were labeled with 10 mg/ml bis-carboxyethyl-carboxyfluorescein acetoxymethylester (a fluoresent probe, BCECF-AM; Sigma) for 30 min at RT. After quenching with 0.1% BSA, the pellet was resuspended in labeling medium. To evaluate monocyte adhesion, HUVEC monolayers treated with TNF-a (1 ng/ml) in the presence or absence of various concentrations of test sample. The media was removed, washed and labeled-THP-1-cells were added to the wells (6x104 cells per well)<br><br>
and incubated for 10 minutes at RT in the dark. After co incubation, the wells were washed, filled with lysis buffer (0.1% Triton-X in 1.5M Tris buffer) and incubated for 30 min. The fluorescence was measured using a fluorescent reader (PolarStar Optima, BMG Labtech) at an excitation peak of 485 nm and an emission peak of 520 nm. Values are means + SEM, representing fluorescent adhesion data. BAY 11-7082 [(E)-3-(4-methylphenylsulfonyl)-2-propenenitrile] was used as a standard and DMSO as vehicle control. The results are summarized in table 6.<br>

Subacute oral toxicity<br><br><br>
Subacute oral toxicity (28 Day) study of extract of example 1 in Sprague Dawley rats was performed in compliance with the guidelines laid down in "Schedule Y" of the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940. (India)<br>
Groups of six male and six female Sprague Dawley rats were administered daily doses of 0, 250, 500 or 1000 mg/kg body weight of extract of example 1 by oral gavage for 28 days and were sacrificed on day 29 to evaluate its toxicity. The rats were examined daily for signs of toxicity. Body weight and food consumption for individual rats were recorded during the experimental period along with all incidences of mortality and signs of ill health. Laboratory investigations were performed on blood at termination of the study.<br>
All animals, when sacrificed terminally, were subjected to a complete necropsy and weights of certain organs were recorded. Histopathological evaluation was carried out on all protocol-listed tissues in all animals from control and high dosage groups.<br>
All animals receiving the extract of example 1 at and upto the dose of 1000 mg/kg survived through the period of treatment. No clinical signs of toxicity were observed in any of the treated animals. The data on the body weight gain and food intake indicated no adverse effect due to the test article at and upto the dose of 1000 mg/kg.<br>
Conclusion: Based on the findings of this study the no observable adverse effect level (NOVEL) of extract of example 1 in rats, following oral administration for 28 days was found to be more than 1000 mg/kg body weight.<br>
