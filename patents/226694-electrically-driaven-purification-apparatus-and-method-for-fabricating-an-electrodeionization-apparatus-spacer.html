In accordance with one or more embodiments, the present invention can be used in conjunction -with apparatus relevant to electrically driven separation techniques. For example, the present invention can be relevant to articles or components utilizing electrodeionization technology. Eiectrodeionization apparatus can be used to remove ionizabie species from liquids through the use of electrically active media under the influence of an electrical potential to influence the transport of the ionizabie species, The electrically active media may function to alternately collect and discharge ionizabie species, or to facilitate the transport of ions continuously by ionic or electronic substitution mechanisms. Eiectrodeionization apparatus can include media having permanent or temporary charge and can be operated to cause electrochemical reactions designed to achieve or enhance performance. These devices also include electrically active membranes such as semipermeable ion exchange membranes, ion-selective membranes, or bipolar membranes,<br>
In accordance with one or more embodiments, the present invention can be used to fabricate articles or component utilized in an eiectrodeionization apparatus. Eiectrodeionization apparatus typically include ion-depleting (depleting) compartments and ion-concentrating (concentrating) compartments. Adjacent compartments typically have an ion-selective membrane positioned therebetween. The assembly of concentrating and depleting compartments, typically known as the stack, may be in alternating order or in any of various arrangements necessary to satisfy design and performance requirements. The stack arrangement is typically bordered by an electrode compartment at one end and another electrode compartment at an opposite end. Typically, end blocks are positioned adjacent to electrode compartment, which contain the electrodes. The concentrating and depleting compartments are typically defined by spacers or structures thai offeet and support ion-selective membranes. The spacer, along with the ion-selective membrane bonded or sealed thereon, define a cavity which may serve as a concentrating or a depleting compartment, depending on operating conditions. A typical eiectrodeionization apparatus has alternating electroactive semi-permeable anion- and cation- selective membranes. The spaces between the ion-selective membranes are typically configured to create liquid flow compartments, A transverse<br><br>
DC electrical field is imposed by an external power source through electrodes at the bounds of the compartments. Upon imposition of the electric field, ions in the liquid to be treated in one compartment, the ion-depleting compartments, are attracted to their respective attracting electrodes. The ions typically migrate through the ion-selective membranes into the adjoining compartments so that the liquid in such adjoining ion-concentrating compartments become ionically concentrated. The volume within the depleting compartments and, in some cases, within the concentrating compartments, includes electrically active media. In electxodeionization apparatus, the electroactive media may include intimately mixed or layered anion and cation exchange resins. Such electroactive media typically enhances the transport of ions within the compartments and may participate as a substrate for controlled electrochemical reactions. As mentioned above, electrodeionization devices have been described by, for example, Grufirida et a!. m U.S. Patent Nos, 4,632,745,4,925,541 and 5,211,823, by Ganzi in U.S. PatentNos&gt; 5,259,936 and 5,316,637, by Parsi et ah in U.S. Patent No. 5,066,375, by Oren et al. in U.S- Patent No. 5,154,809 and by Kedem in U.S. Patent No. 5,240,579, each of which is incorporated herein by reference in their entireties.<br>
The concentrating and depleting compartments can be filled with cation exchange resins, anion exchange resins or a mixture of both. The cation and anion exchange resins can be arranged as mixtures or as layers within any of the depleting, concentrating and electrode compartments so that a number of layers in a variety of arrangements can bo assembled. The use of mixed bed ion exchange resins in any of the depleting, concentrating and electrode compartments, the use of inert resin between layers of beds of anionic and cationic exchange resins,* as well as the use of various types of anionic and cationic exchange resins, such as those described by DiMascio et al., in U.S. Patent No. 5,858,191* which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety, is contemplated to be within the scope of the invention.<br>

In some cases, the elastomeric material further<br><br>
encapsulates the rigid core and forms a sheath 375 on at least a portion of a surface of the rigid core as a unitary elastoffleric material.<br>

The resin cavity seal 580 had a profile having a middle protruded region 685 between recessed regions 690. Seal 580 also had level regions 695 at the periphery of the seal. The seal profile was created by providing a mold assembly having corresponding features complementarity defining the protruded regions and recessed regions. FIG. 14 shows a portion of the seal dsposed in the electrodeionization apparatus before the electrodionization apparatus assembly was tightened. In particular, it shows the ion-selective membrane 660 against the protruded region 685 of the seal and between the rigid core 700 of the adjacent concentrating compartment In this embodiment, the protruded region 685 had a diameter of about 0.060 inch. A curved portion 705 of the recessed region 690 had a diameter of about .0.030 inch. The separation distance defining between the wall of the protruded region   : 685 and the level region 695 was about 0.018 inch. Once the assembly is tightened, the protruded region 685 would compress and deform to conform with the shape of the   ■ membrane 660 and the rigid core 700. In particular, the elastomeric material comprising the seal would deform under compressive loading into the space defined by the recessed regions 690. The particular ratios and dimensions of each of the seal sections were selected to provide a 30% crush capability. The seals were fabricated to provide:<br><br>
wherein Hi is the greatest dimension of protruded region 685 from a datum 710 defined by level region 695, Kb is the greatest dimension of recessed region 690 from datum 710, Ai is the cross-sectional area included in the protruded region 685 and datum 710, A2 is the cross-sectional open area included in the recessed region 690 and datum 710, Ri is the radius of protruded region 685, and R3 is the radius of recessed region 690, Likewise, seals 570 and 605 had similar profiles.<br>
The depleting compartments were filled with layers of cation and anion exchange resins, DOWEX™ MONOSPHBRE™ 650C cation resin, available from The Dow Chemical Company, Midland, Michigan and a mixture of DOWEX™<br><br>
MARATHON™ A anion resin, available from The Dow Chemical Company, Midland, Michigan, and AMBERJET* 4600 anion resin, available from Rohm and Haas Company, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The concentrating compartments were filled with a mixture of cation and anion resins, DOWEX™ MONOSPHERE™650C cation resin, DOWEX™ MARATHON™ A anion resin, and AMBERJET* 4600 anion resin.<br>

615.<br>
The completed electrodeionization apparatus, shown in FIG. 13, was pressurized with water to over 50 psi without any external leaks, confirming the effectiveness of the peripheral seals 570. Cross-leakage between the diluting and concentrating compartments was measured at 5 psi differential confirming that there was no leakage and that the seals around the fhroughports 620 in Fid 12 effectively fluidly isolated the various structures.<br>
The electrodeionization apparatus was operated under the following conditions:<br>
Feed water flow rate:	llOliter/min<br>
Feed water conductivity:	10 |*$/cm<br>
Feed water COs concentration:	2.5 ppm<br>
Feed water temperature:	10 °C<br>
Voltage applied:	130 VDC<br>
Current:	0.3 amp<br>
Water recovery:	90%<br>
The water recovery is the fraction of the feed water that was purified; the flow rate of the purified product was therefore 100 liter/min.<br>
The product, purified water, conductivity was measured as 0.059 jxS/cni, indicating removal of greater than 99.4% of the dissolved ions in the feed water. The pressure drop through the electrodeionization apparatus was measured as 10 psi.<br>
Example 5. Disposable and Sealed Fuel Cell<br><br>
In this example, a disposable and/or sealed fuel cell can be fabricated according to the present invention. Fuel cells, including fhosebased on proton exchange membrane (PEM) technology, can be used, for example, to power portable electrical equipment and electronic devices such as laptop computers and cell phones. Fuels cells can be used in a portable applications especially where the volumetric power density increases and the cost decreases through advancement in the design, performance and properties of components such as the membrane, die electrodes, and the flow field plates. Examples of fuel cell apparatus, including those based on proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) technology, are available from Plug Power Inc., Latham, New York, and Ballard Power Systems Inc., Buroaby, BC, Canada.<br>
FIG. 15 is a cross-sectional view of a portion 715 of a typical PEMFC. The fuel cell typically has planar membrane-electrode assemblies (MEA) 720 secured between flow field plates 725. Each MEA 720 typically comprises a construction comprising an anode 730, a PEM 735 and a cathode 740. Grooves 745 defined in the flow field plates 725 typically serve as conduits to facilitate transport of reactant gases, typically hydrogen and oxygen, to the MEA 720 during operation of the fiiel celL The plates 725, which are typically fabricated from graphite or graphite composites, can also serve to collect the current generated at MEA 720*<br>
One of the challenges of fuel cell construction is a seal around a perimeter of the MEA 720. Tbe PEM 735 may serve as a gasket between adjacent plates. FIG. 16 is an enlarged view of aportion of a sealed PEMFC shown in FIG. 15. FIG. 16 shows MEA 720 disposed between two adjacent plates 725, contacting at interfaces 770. An aperture 765 defined between plates 725 and outside of interfaces 770 ensures that the plates 725 are not in electrical contact The fiiel cell typically has multiply stacked alternating plates 725 and MEA 720,<br>
la one embodiment of the invention related to the fabrication of a seal fuel cell stack, the fuel cell stack is disposed in a mold (not shown) and molten TPE material is injected into a channel 750 defined, at least partially, by the grooves 755 in plates 725. Upon cooling, the injected TPE material 760 fills the spaced defined by channel 755 as well as aperture 765 and forms a seal 780 around MEA 720, The TPE material 760 is typically selected to be electrically insulating, compatible with the operating temperature, and chemically compatible with the reactant gases.
