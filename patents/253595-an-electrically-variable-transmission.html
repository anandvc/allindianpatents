HYBRID ARCHITECTURE INCORPORATING THREE INTERCONNECTED<br>
GEAR SETS AND BRAKES<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001]		The present invention relates to electrically variable transmissions<br>
having three planetary gear sets, three motor/generators and at least one brake that<br>
are controllable to provide continuously variable speed ratio ranges.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002]		Electric hybrid vehicles offer the potential for significant fuel economy<br>
improvements over their conventional counterparts; however, their market penetration<br>
is limited because of their relatively high cost/benefit ratio. It becomes pertinent to<br>
develop hybrid technologies that reduce cost and improve vehicle fuel economy. Two<br>
of the contributors to the cost of the hybrid vehicle are the energy storage (battery)<br>
power capacity and the size of the electric motor/generators required to realize all-<br>
electric reverse in many electric-variable-transmission (EVT)-based hybrid systems.<br>
One of the factors that affect the efficiency of the system is the operating efficiency of<br>
the motor/generators.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0003]		This invention describes continuously-variable hybrid transmissions<br>
that utilize a combination of three interconnected planetary gear sets, electric<br>
motor/generators and brakes to offer multi-mode EVTs with capability for series<br>
hybrid reverse driving, thus reducing the need for massive and expensive energy<br>
storage (battery), and to minimize operating the motor/generators under highly<br>
inefficient conditions. In the series hybrid reverse driving mode, power from the<br>
engine is used to drive at least one of the motor/generators to generate electric power,<br>
and the generated electric power is delivered to at least one of the other<br>
motor/generators to drive the vehicle in the forward or reverse direction. This<br>
capability eliminates the need for significant power from the battery to drive the<br>
vehicle in reverse.<br><br>
GP-308226-PTH-CD<br>
2<br>
[0004]		The continuously-variable hybrid transmission family of the present<br>
invention provides low-content, low-cost electrically variable transmission<br>
mechanisms including first, second and third differential gear sets, a battery (or<br>
similar energy storage device), three electric machines serving interchangeably as<br>
motors or generators and at least one brake. Preferably, the differential gear sets are<br>
planetary gear sets, but other gear arrangements may be implemented, such as bevel<br>
gears or differential gearing to an offset axis.<br>
[0005]		In this description, the first, second and third planetary gear sets may<br>
be counted first to third in any order (i.e., left to right, right to left, etc.).<br>
[0006]		Each of the three planetary gear sets has three members. The first,<br>
second or third member of each planetary gear set can be any one of a sun gear, ring<br>
gear or carrier, or alternatively a pinion.<br>
[0007]		Each carrier can be either a single-pinion carrier (simple) or a double-<br>
pinion carrier (compound).<br>
[0008]		The input shaft is continuously connected with a member of the<br>
planetary gear sets. The output shaft is continuously connected with another member<br>
of the planetary gear sets.<br>
[0009]		A first interconnecting member continuously connects the first member<br>
of the first planetary gear set with the first member of the second planetary gear set.<br>
[0010]		A second interconnecting member continuously connects the second<br>
member of the first planetary gear set with the first member of the third planetary gear<br>
set.<br>
[0011]		A third interconnecting member continuously connects the second<br>
member of the second planetary gear set with the second member of the third<br>
planetary gear set.<br>
[0012]		A first motor/generator is connected to a member of the first or second<br>
planetary gear set.<br>
[0013]		A second motor/generator is connected to a member of the second or<br>
third planetary gear set.<br>
[0014]		A third motor/generator is connected to another member of the first or<br>
third planetary gear set.<br><br>
GP-308226-PTH-CD<br>
3<br>
[0015]		The motor/generators are connected with the members of the planetary<br>
gear sets either directly or through other planetary gear sets, belt/chain or off-set gears<br>
with or without torque multiplication.<br>
[0016]		A first brake selectively connects a member of the first, second or third<br>
planetary gear set with a stationary member (transmission housing/casing). This<br>
brake is operable to hold the member stationary and enable series hybrid mode<br>
operation. Using the first brake rather than one of the motor/generators to enable the<br>
hybrid mode of operation reduces the torque capacity requirement for the motors and<br>
improves efficiency. Also, application of the first brake during electric-only drive<br>
(forward or reverse) allows the engine to be started without "engine start shock".<br>
[0017]		Optionally, an additional brake or brakes, i.e., a second or third brake,<br>
selectively connects another member of the planetary gear sets with a stationary<br>
member and is operable to selectively hold this member of the planetary gear sets<br>
stationary under certain operating conditions to provide different EVT ranges.<br>
[0018]		The brakes may further be connected in parallel with one or more of<br>
the motor/generators and be selectively applied under operating conditions that would<br>
otherwise require one of the motor/generators to operate at zero or near-zero speeds,<br>
thereby improving efficiency by preventing the inefficient use of electric power to<br>
maintain zero or near-zero speed. This may further reduce the torque capacity (size)<br>
requirement of the motor/generators.<br>
[0019]		The brakes are preferably electromechanically actuated to eliminate the<br>
need for the high-pressure hydraulic pump and associated losses; however, other<br>
conventional brake actuation methods may be used.<br>
[0020]		The three motor/generators are operated in a coordinated fashion to<br>
yield continuously variable forward and reverse speed ratios between the input shaft<br>
and the output shaft, while minimizing the rotational speeds of the motor-generators<br>
and optimizing the overall efficiency of the system. The tooth ratios of the planetary<br>
gear sets can be suitably selected to match specific applications.<br>
[0021]		The above features and advantages and other features and advantages<br>
of the present invention are readily apparent from the following detailed description<br>
of the best modes for carrying out the invention when taken in connection with the<br>
accompanying drawings.<br><br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
[0031]		With reference to Figure 1, a powertrain 10 is shown, including an<br>
engine 12 connected to one preferred embodiment of the improved electrically<br>
variable transmission (EVT), designated generally by the numeral 14. Transmission<br>
14 is designed to receive at least a portion of its driving power from the engine 12.<br>
As shown, the engine 12 has an output shaft that serves as the input member 17 of<br>
the transmission 14. A transient torque damper (not shown) may also be<br>
implemented between the engine 12 and the input member 17 of the transmission.<br>
[0032]		In the embodiment depicted the engine 12 may be a fossil fuel engine,<br>
such as a gasoline or diesel engine which is readily adapted to provide its available<br>
power output typically delivered at a selectable number of revolutions per minute<br>
(RPM).<br>
[0033]		Irrespective of the means by which the engine 12 is connected to the<br>
transmission input member 17, the transmission input member 17 is operatively<br>
connected to a planetary gear set in the transmission 14.<br>
[0034]		An output member 19 of the transmission 14 is connected to a final<br>
drive 16.<br>
[0035]		The transmission 14 utilizes three differential gear sets, preferably in<br>
the nature of planetary gear sets 20, 30 and 40. The planetary gear set 20 employs<br>
an outer gear member 24, typically designated as the ring gear. The ring gear<br>
member 24 circumscribes an inner gear member 22, typically designated as the sun<br>
gear. A carrier member 26 rotatably supports a plurality of planet gears 27 such<br>
that each planet gear 27 simultaneously, and meshingly engages both the outer, ring<br>
gear member 24 and the inner, sun gear member 22 of the first planetary gear set<br>
20.<br>
[0036]		The planetary gear set 30 also employs an outer gear member 34,<br>
typically designated as the ring gear. The ring gear member 34 circumscribes an<br>
inner gear member 32, typically designated as the sun gear. A carrier member 36<br>
rotatably supports a plurality of planet gears 37 such that each planet gear 37<br>
simultaneously, and meshingly engages both the outer, ring gear member 34 and the<br>
inner, sun gear member 32 of the planetary gear set 30.<br><br>
GP-308226-PTH-CD<br>
6<br>
[0037]		The planetary gear set 40 also employs an outer gear member 44,<br>
typically designated as the ring gear. The ring gear member 44 circumscribes an<br>
inner gear member 42, typically designated as the sun gear. A carrier member 46<br>
rotatably supports a plurality of planet gears 47 such that each planet gear 47<br>
simultaneously, and meshingly engages both the outer, ring gear member 44 and the<br>
inner, sun gear member 42 of the planetary gear set 40.<br>
[0038]		The input shaft 17 is continuously connected to the carrier member 26<br>
of the planetary gear set 20. The output shaft 19 is continuously connected to the<br>
carrier member 46 of the planetary gear set 40.<br>
[0039]		A first interconnecting member 70 continuously connects the carrier<br>
member 26 of the planetary gear set 20 with the ring gear member 34 of the<br>
planetary gear set 30. A second interconnecting member 72 continuously connects<br>
the ring gear member 24 of the planetary gear set 20 with the ring gear member 44<br>
of the planetary gear set 40. A third interconnecting member 74 continuously<br>
connects the carrier member 36 of the planetary gear set 30 with the sun gear<br>
member 42 of the planetary gear set 40.<br>
[0040]		A brake 50 selectively connects the ring gear member 24 of the<br>
planetary gear set 20 and the ring gear member 44 of the planetary gear set 40 via<br>
the interconnecting member 72 with the transmission housing 60. This brake 50<br>
enables series hybrid driving mode wherein power from the engine 12 is used to<br>
drive motor/generator 80 to generate electric power, and the generated electric<br>
power is delivered to at least one of the other motor/generators 82, 84 to drive the<br>
vehicle in forward or reverse.<br>
[0041]		The first embodiment 10 also incorporates first, second and third<br>
motor/generators 80, 82 and 84, respectively. The stator of the first motor/generator<br>
80 is secured to the transmission housing 60. The rotor of the first motor/generator<br>
80 is secured to the sun gear member 22 of the planetary gear set 20.<br>
[0042]		The stator of the second motor/generator 82 is secured to the<br>
transmission housing 60. The rotor of the second motor/generator 82 is secured to<br>
the sun gear member 42 of the planetary gear set 40.<br><br>
GP-308226-PTH-CD<br>
7<br>
[0043]		The stator of the third motor/generator 84 is secured to the<br>
transmission housing 60. The rotor of the third motor/generator 84 is secured to the<br>
sun gear member 32 of the planetary gear set 30.<br>
[0044]		Returning now to the description of the power sources, it should be<br>
apparent from the foregoing description, and with particular reference to Figure 1,<br>
that the transmission 14 selectively receives power from the engine 12. The hybrid<br>
transmission also receives power from an electric power source 86, which is<br>
operably connected to a controller 88. The electric power source 86 may be one or<br>
more batteries. Other electric power sources, such as capacitors or fuel cells, that<br>
have the ability to provide, or store, and dispense electric power may be used in<br>
place of or in combination with batteries without altering the concepts of the present<br>
invention. The speed ratio between the input shaft and output shaft is prescribed by<br>
the speeds of the three motor/generators and the ring gear/sun gear tooth ratios of<br>
the planetary gear sets. Those with ordinary skill in the transmission art will<br>
recognize that desired input/output speed ratios can be realized by suitable selection<br>
of the speeds of the three motor/generators.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF A SECOND EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENT<br>

planetary gear set 120 and the ring gear member 144 of the planetary gear set 140<br>
via interconnecting member 172 with the transmission housing 160. This brake 150<br>
enables series hybrid mode operation in forward and reverse.<br>
[0055]		The second embodiment 110 also incorporates first, second and third<br>

DESCRIPTION OF A NINTH EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENT<br>
[00138]	With reference to Figure 9, a powertrain 810 is shown, including an<br>
engine 12 connected to another embodiment of the improved electrically variable<br>
transmission (EVT), designated generally by the numeral 814. Transmission 814 is<br>
designed to receive at least a portion of its driving power from the engine 12. As<br>
hown, the engine 12 has an output shaft that serves as the input member 17 of the<br>
transmission 814. A transient torque damper (not shown) may also be implemented<br>
between the engine 12 and the input member 17 of the transmission.<br>
[00139]	In the embodiment depicted the engine 12 may be a fossil fuel engine,<br>
such as a gasoline or diesel engine which is readily adapted to provide its available<br>
power output typically delivered at a selectable number of revolutions per minute<br>
(RPM).<br>
[00140]	Irrespective of the means by which the engine 12 is connected to the<br>
transmission input member 17, the transmission input member 17 is operatively<br>
connected to a planetary gear set in the transmission 814. An output member 19 of<br>
the transmission 814 is connected to a final drive 16.<br>
[00141]	The transmission 814 utilizes three differential gear sets, preferably<br>
in the nature of planetary gear sets 820, 830 and 840. The planetary gear set 820<br>
employs an outer gear member 824, typically designated as the ring gear. The ring<br>
gear member 824 circumscribes an inner gear member 822, typically designated as<br>
the sun gear. A carrier member 826 rotatably supports a plurality of planet gears<br><br>
GP-308226-PTH-CD<br>
25<br>
827 such that each planet gear 827 simultaneously, and meshingly engages both the<br>
outer, ring gear member 824 and the inner, sun gear member 822 of the planetary<br>
gear set 820.<br>
[00142]	The planetary gear set 830 also employs an outer gear member 834,<br>
typically designated as the ring gear. The ring gear member 834 circumscribes an<br>
inner gear member 832, typically designated as the sun gear. A carrier member 836<br>
rotatably supports a plurality of planet gears 837, 838 such that each planet gear 837<br>
meshing engages the outer, ring gear member 834 and each planet gear 838<br>
simultaneously, and meshingly engages both the inner, sun gear member 832 and the<br>
respective planet gear 837 of the planetary gear set 830.<br>
[00143]	The planetary gear set 840 also employs an outer gear member 844,<br>
typically designated as the ring gear. The ring gear member 844 circumscribes an<br>
inner gear member 842, typically designated as the sun gear. A carrier member 846<br>
rotatably supports a plurality of planet gears 847 such that each planet gear 847<br>
simultaneously, and meshingly engages both the outer, ring gear member 844 and the<br>
inner, sun gear member 842 of the planetary gear set 840.<br>
[00144]	The input shaft 17 is continuously connected to the ring gear member<br>
824. The output shaft 19 is continuously connected to the carrier member 846.<br>
[00145]	A first interconnecting member 870 continuously connects the sun<br>
gear member 822 with the ring gear member 834. A second interconnecting<br>
member 872 continuously connects the carrier member 826 with the sun gear<br>
member 842. A third interconnecting member 874 continuously connects the sun<br>
gear member 832 with the ring gear member 844.<br>
[00146]	A brake 850 selectively connects the carrier member 826 with the<br>
transmission housing 860. This brake 850 enables series hybrid operation in<br>
forward and reverse.<br>
[00147]	The embodiment 810 also incorporates first, second and third<br>
motor/generators 880, 882 and 884, respectively. The stator of the first<br>
motor/generator 880 is secured to the transmission housing 860. The rotor of the<br>
first motor/generator 880 is secured to the ring gear member 834 via an offset drive<br>
890, such as a belt or chain, which may change the speed ratio.<br><br>
GP-308226-PTH-CD<br>
26<br>
[00148]	The stator of the second motor/generator 882 is secured to the<br>
transmission housing 860. The rotor of the second motor/generator 882 is secured<br>
to the carrier member 836.<br>
[00149]	The stator of the third motor/generator 884 is secured to the<br>
transmission housing 860. The rotor of the third motor/generator 884 is secured to<br>
the ring gear member 844 via offset gear 892, which may change the speed ratio.<br>
[00150]	The hybrid transmission 814 receives power from the engine 12, and<br>
also exchanges power with an electric power source 886, which is operably connected<br>
to a controller 888.<br>
[00151]	While the best modes for carrying out the invention have been<br>
described in detail, those familiar with the art to which this invention relates will<br>
