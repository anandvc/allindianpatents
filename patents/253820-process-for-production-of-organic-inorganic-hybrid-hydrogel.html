[TECHNICAL FIELD]<br>
[0001]<br>
The present invention relates to a production process of<br>
an organic/inorganic composite hydrogel having a<br>
three-dimensional network structure comprising a polymer of a<br>
water-soluble organic monomer and a water-swellable clay<br>
mineral, a coated film of an organic/inorganic composite<br>
hydrogel and a cell culture substrate comprising that coated<br>
film, and a dried coated film of an organic/inorganic composite<br>
hydrogel and an antifogging coated film comprising that dried<br>
coated film,<br>
[BACKGROUND ART]<br>
[0002]<br>
Polymer composites referred to as nanocomposites have<br>
conventionally been prepared by compounding an organic polymer<br>
such as polyamide, polystyrene, polypropylene, polyimide or<br>
polyurethane with clay. Since the resulting polymer composite<br>
is finely dispersed in a clay layer having a large aspect ratio,<br>
the elastic modulus, heat deflection temperature, gas<br><br>
permeability, burning rate and so forth are known to be<br>
effectively improved.<br>
[0003]<br>
An organic/inorganic composite hydrogel having a<br>
three-dimensional mesh structure composed of a polymer of a<br>
water-soluble acrylic monomer and a water-swellable clay<br>
mineral has been disclosed as an example of a nanocomposite<br>
material having particularly superior mechanical properties<br>
(see, for example, Japanese Unexamined Patent Application,<br>
First Publication No. 2002-053762 and Japanese Unexamined<br>
Patent Application, First Publication No. 2004-143212). Since<br>
this organic/inorganic composite hydrogel has superior<br>
mechanical properties not found in other gels, it is expected<br>
to be applied in various applications. In order to deploy the<br>
application thereof in various applications, the<br>
organic/inorganic composite hydrogel is frequently required to<br>
be formed into a coated film such as a thin film or film, formed<br>
into a pattern, or formed into a laminated structure, and in<br>
such cases, the composite hydrogel is easily molded into these<br>
shapes and forms by producing an organic/inorganic composite<br>
hydrogel using an energy beam.<br>
[0004]<br>
As an example of a production process of the prior art,<br>
a process has been disclosed in which an acrylamide or<br><br>
acrylamide derivative and a (meth)acrylic acid ester and so<br>
forth are polymerized by heating' or irradiation with<br>
ultraviolet light in the presence of a water-swellable clay<br>
mineral in an agueous medium and an aqueous polymerization<br>
initiator (see, for example, Japanese Unexamined Patent<br>
Application, First Publication No. 2002-053762 and Japanese<br>
Unexamined Patent Application, First Publication No.<br>
2004-143212). However, in the case of using a water-soluble<br>
peroxide for the polymerization initiator and carrying out the<br>
polymerization reaction by irradiating with ultraviolet light<br>
as in the process disclosed here, there were cases in which the<br>
mechanical properties of the resulting organic/inorganic<br>
composite hydrogel were not adequately obtained as well as cases<br>
in which elution of linear polymer occurred. In addition, since<br>
a water-soluble peroxide is used for the polymerization<br>
initiator, since the polymer composite is polymerized by<br>
allowing to stand undisturbed for several tens of minutes to<br>
more than ten hours at a constant temperature such as room<br>
temperature in the state in which oxygen in the polymer solution<br>
has been removed, there has been a need to simplify the<br>
production process as well as shorten the production time.<br>
[0005]<br>
These problems occur particularly prominently when forming<br>
a coated film, thereby preventing the obtaining of an<br><br>
organic/inorganic composite hydrogel coated film having<br>
adequate mechanical properties and resulting in a desire to<br>
realize an organic/inorganic composite hydrogel coated film<br>
suitable for deployment in various applications.<br>
[DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION]<br>
[Problems to be Solved by the Invention]<br>
[0007]<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide a<br>
production process of an organic/inorganic composite hydrogel<br>
having superior mechanical properties in a production process<br>
of an organic / inorganic composite hydrogel using an energy<br>
beam, and an antifogging coated film and cell culture substrate<br>
that use the resulting organic/inorganic composite hydrogel.<br>
[Means for Solving the Problems]<br>
[0008]<br>
As a result of conducting extensive studies to solve the<br>
aforementioned problems, the inventors of the present invention<br>
found that by dispersing a non-water-soluble polymerization<br>
initiator (d) in an aqueous medium (c) and reacting, in the<br>
resulting dispersion , a water-soluble monomer (a) by<br>
irradiating with an energy beam in the presence of a<br>
water-swellable clay mineral, the reaction is completed nearly<br>
instantaneously while being resistant to the effects of oxygen.<br>
Moreover, it was also found that by dispersing a<br><br>
non-water-soluble photopolymerization initiator (d) in the<br>
aqueous medium (c) , the non-water-soluble photopolymerization<br>
initiator (d) is interposed around the water-swellable clay<br>
mineral (b) when the water-swellable clay mineral (b) is present<br>
in the dispersion. When the water-soluble organic monomer (a)<br>
is polymerized in such an environment, the polymerization<br>
reaction begins from the photopolymerization initiator<br>
interposed around the water-swellable clay mineral (b) , bonding<br>
between a polymer of the water-soluble organic monomer (a) and<br>
the water-swellable clay mineral (b) proceeds favorably, and<br>
a three-dimensional network structure is formed in which the<br>
polymer of the water-soluble organic monomer (a) is crosslinked<br>
between the water-swellable clay mineral (b) , thereby allowing<br>
the production of an organic/inorganic composite hydrogel<br>
having superior mechanical properties.<br>
[0009]<br>
Namely, the present invention provides a production<br>
process of an organic/inorganic composite hydrogel having a<br>
three-dimensional network structure composed of a polymer of<br>
a water-soluble organic monomer (a) and a water-swellable clay<br>
mineral (b), wherein<br>
a non-water-soluble polymerization initiator (d) is<br>
dispersed in an aqueous medium (c), and the water-soluble<br>
organic monomer (a) is reacted in the resulting dispersion by<br><br>
irradiating with an energy beam in the presence of the<br>
water-swellable clay mineral (b).<br>
[0010]<br>
In addition, the present invention provides a production<br>
process of a coated film comprising an organic/inorganic<br>
composite hydrogel having a three-dimensional network<br>
structure composed of a polymer of a water-soluble organic<br>
monomer (a) and a water-swellable clay mineral (b), wherein<br>
an energy beam-curable composition (X), containing a<br>
dispersion of a non-water-soluble polymerization initiator (d)<br>
dispersed in the water-soluble organic monomer (a), the<br>
water-swellable clay mineral (b) and an aqueous medium (c) , is<br>
coated onto a substrate followed by irradiating with an energy<br>
beam.<br>
[0011]	<br>
In addition, the present invention provides a production<br>
process of a thin film comprising a dried organic/inorganic<br>
composite hydrogel having a three-dimensional network<br>
structure composed of a polymer of a water-soluble monomer (a)<br>
and a water-swellable clay mineral (b) , wherein<br>
an energy beam-curable composition (X), containing a<br>
dispersion of a non-water-soluble polymerization initiator (d)<br>
dispersed in the water-soluble monomer (a), the water-swellable<br>
clay mineral (b) and an aqueous medium (c), is coated onto a<br><br>
substrate followed by irradiating with an energy beam to form<br>
an organic/inorganic composite hydrogel coated film, and<br>
removing the solvent from the organic/inorganic composite<br>
hydrogel coated film.<br>
[0012]<br>
In addition, the present invention provides a culture<br>
substrate comprising an organic/inorganic composite hydrogel<br>
having a three-dimensional network structure composed of a<br>
polymer of a water-soluble organic monomer (a) and a<br>
water-swellable clay mineral (b).<br>
[0013]<br>
In addition, the present invention provides an antif ogging<br>
material comprising a dried organic/inorganic composite<br>
hydrogel having a three-dimensional network structure composed<br>
of a polymer of a water-soluble organic monomer (a) and a<br>
water-swellable clay mineral (b).<br>
[Effects of the Invention]<br>
[0014]<br>
According to the production process of the present<br>
invention, since the production process is resistant to the<br>
effects of oxygen when polymerizing an organic/inorganic<br>
composite hydrogel, equipment and steps for removing oxygen are<br>
not required, thereby allowing the organic/inorganic composite<br>
hydrogel to be easily produced. Moreover, the<br><br>
organic/inorganic composite hydrogel can be produced in an<br>
extremely short period of time as a result of polymerizing by<br>
irradiating with an energy beam. In addition, as a result of<br>
having the characteristics of being resistant to the effects<br>
of oxygen on polymerization and polymerization being able to<br>
be completed in an extremely short period of time, the resulting<br>
organic/inorganic composite hydrogel and dried product thereof<br>
is able to realize superior mechanical properties and<br>
flexibility by uniformly dispersing the clay mineral in the<br>
organic polymer over a wide range of clay mineral content.<br>
[0015]<br>
Since the organic/inorganic composite hydrogel and dried<br>
product thereof of the present invention exhibits superior<br>
mechanical properties and flexibility of the organic/inorganic<br>
composite hydrogel despite being a coated film by uniformly<br>
dispersing the clay mineral in an organic polymer over a wide<br>
range of clay mineral content, they are useful as materials for<br>
medical and nursing care devices as well as various types of<br>
industrial materials.<br>
[0016]<br>
Since the culture substrate comprising the<br>
organic/inorganic composite hydrogel of the present invention<br>
has superior flexibility and toughness, it is able to stably<br>
transport cultured cells while retaining its shape even when<br><br>
transporting cultured cells along with the substrate.<br>
Moreover, in the case of carrying out co-culturing and so forth<br>
following initial cell culturing, culturing can be repeated<br>
without being contaminated by culture liquid or chemicals. In<br>
particular, since cell culture substrates in which<br>
hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity reversibly change according<br>
to the external environment exhibit superior adhesion with<br>
cells under hydrophobic conditions, they are able to<br>
effectively culture and grow cells, and since they are able to<br>
lower adhesion with cells under hydrophilic conditions, cell<br>
can be detached without using a protein hydrolase such as<br>
trypsin or chemicals, thereby enabling cells to be recovered<br>
easily without damaging cells or causing separation or<br>
contamination by the substrate. Moreover, since the change<br>
from hydrophobicity to hydrophilicity or from hydrophilicity<br>
to hydrophobicity occurs rapidly, the effects on cells during<br>
changes in temperature and other parameters of the external<br>
environment are low.<br>
[0017]<br>
Since the antifogging coated film comprising the dried<br>
organic/inorganic composite hydrogel.of the present invention<br>
exhibits superior mechanical properties and antifogging<br>
properties by uniformly dispersing a clay mineral in an organic<br>
polymer over a wide range of clay mineral content while<br><br>
simultaneously having favorable adhesion with various types of<br>
substrates, it can be used as a material for medical and nursing<br>
care devices as well as various types of industrial materials.<br>
[BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION]<br>
[0018]<br>
[Organic/Inorganic Composite Hydrogel Production Process]<br>
The water-soluble organic monomer (a) used in the present<br>
invention has the property of dissolving in water, and together<br>
with interacting with the water-swellable clay mineral (b)<br>
capable of uniformly dispersing in water, is polymerized by<br>
being irradiated with radiation, and preferably has a<br>
functional group capable of forming a hydrogen bond, ionic bond,<br>
coordinate bond or covalent bond and so forth with a clay mineral.<br>
Specific examples of water-soluble organic monomers having a<br>
functional group include water-soluble organic monomers having<br>
an amide group, amino group, ester group, hydroxyl group,<br>
tetramethyl ammonium group, silanol group or epoxy group, with<br>
water-soluble organic monomers having an amide group being<br>
preferable. In addition, water as referred to in the present<br>
invention includes mixed solvents of organic solvents miscible<br>
with water having water as a main component thereof. In<br>
particular, water-soluble acrylic monomers are preferable, and<br>
the use of a water-soluble acrylic monomer allows the<br>
non-water-soluble initiator to be more finely and uniformly<br><br>
dispersed, and the obtaining of an organic/inorganic composite<br>
hydrogel having more superior properties and is resistant to<br>
the effects of oxygen during polymerization by an energy beam.<br>
[0019]<br>
Preferable examples of such water-soluble organic monomers<br>
(a) that can be used include N-substituted acrylamide<br>
derivatives, N,N-disubstituted acrylamide derivatives,<br>
N-substituted methacrylamide derivatives and<br>
N,N-disubstituted methacrylamide derivatives, with specific<br>
examples including N-isopropyl acrylamide, N-isopropyl<br>
methacrylamide, N-n-propyl acrylamide, N-n-propyl<br>
methacrylamide, N-cyclopropyl acrylamide, N-cyclopropyl<br>
methacrylamide, N-ethoxyethyl acrylamide, N-ethoxyethyl<br>
methacrylamide, N-tetrahydrofurfuryl acrylamide,<br>
N-tetrahydrofurfuryl methacrylamide, N-ethyl acrylamide,<br>
N-ethyl-N-methyl acrylamide, N,N-diethyl acrylamide,<br>
N-methyl-N-n-propyl acrylamide, N-methyl-N-isopropyl<br>
acrylamide, N-acryloyl piperidine and N-acryloyl pyrrolidine.<br>
[0020]<br>
The acrylic monomers of formulas (1) to (6) below are used<br>
even more preferably.<br>
[Chemical Formula 1]<br><br><br><br>
(wherein, R1 represents a hydrogen atom or methyl group, R2 and<br>
R3 respectively and independently represent a hydrogen atom or<br>
alkyl group having 1 to 3 carbon atoms, R4 represents an alkyl<br>
group having 1 to 2 carbon atoms, and n is 1 to 9) .<br>
[0021]<br>
One or more types of the aforementioned water-soluble<br>
organic monomers may be used as a mixture according to the<br><br>
required mechanical properties, chemical properties and so<br>
forth.<br>
[0022]<br>
In addition, other copolymerizable monomers can also be<br>
used in combination to a degree that does not have an effect<br>
on the properties of the organic/inorganic composite hydrogel,<br>
examples of which include acrylic monomers having an anionic<br>
group such as a sulfone group or carboxyl group, acrylic<br>
monomers having a cationic group such as a quaternary ammonium<br>
group, acrylic monomers having amphoteric ionic groups such as<br>
a quaternary ammonium group and a phosphate group, acrylic<br>
monomers having amino acid residues such as a carboxyl group<br>
and an amino group, acrylic monomers having a sugar residue,<br>
acrylic monomers having a hydroxyl group, acrylic monomers<br>
having a polyethylene glycol or polypropylene glycol chain,<br>
amphipathic acrylic monomers having both a hydrophilic chain<br>
such as polyethylene glycol and a hydrophobic group such as a<br>
nonylphenyl group, polyethylene glycol diacrylate and<br>
N,N'-methylene bisacrylamide.<br>
[0023]<br>
A polymer of the water-soluble organic monomer (a) in the<br>
present invention is able to form an organic/inorganic<br>
composite hydrogel of a stable form by forming a<br>
three-dimensional network structure with the water-swellable<br><br>
clay mineral (b) and acrylic compounds comprised of the<br>
previously listed monomers or vinyl compounds and so forth can<br>
be used. Examples of polymers of the water-soluble organic<br>
monomer (a) include poly(N-isopropylacrylamide),<br>
poly(N-n-propylacrylamide),<br>
poly(N-cyclopropylmethacrylamide) ,<br>
poly(N-isopropylmethacrylamide),<br>
poly(N-n-propylmethacrylamide),<br>
poly(N-ethoxyethylacrylamide),<br>
poly(N-ethoxyethylmethacrylamide) ,<br>
poly(N-tetrahydrofurfurylacrylamide),<br>
poly(N-tetrahydrofurfurylmethacrylamide) ,<br>
poly(N-ethylacrylamide), poly(N,N-diethylacrylamide),<br>
poly(N-acryloylpiperidine) and poly(N-acryloylpyrrolidine).<br>
[0024]<br>
An example of the water-swellable clay mineral (b) used<br>
in the present invention is a swellable clay mineral capable<br>
of separating into a layered form, and is preferably a clay<br>
mineral capable of swelling and uniformly dispersing in water<br>
or a mixed solvent of water and an organic solvent, and<br>
particularly preferably an inorganic clay mineral capable of<br>
uniformly dispersing in a molecular form (single layer) or level<br>
close thereto in water. For example, water-swellable smectite<br>
or water-swellable mica can be used, specific examples of which<br><br>
include water-swellable hectorite, water-swellable<br>
montmorillonite, water-swellable saponite, and<br>
water-swellable synthetic mica, containing sodium as an<br>
interlayer ion. These clay minerals may also be used as a<br>
mixture.<br>
[0025]<br>
When producing the organic/inorganic composite hydrogel<br>
of the present invention, the weight ratio (b)/(a) of the<br>
water-swellable clay mineral (b) to the water-soluble organic<br>
monomer (a) is preferably 0.01 to 10, more preferably 0.03 to<br>
5, and particularly preferably 0.05 to 3. If the weight ratio<br>
(b)/(a) is less than 0.01, the mechanical properties of the<br>
resulting organic/inorganic composite hydrogel tend to be<br>
inadequate, while if the ratio exceeds 10, it becomes difficult<br>
to disperse the clay mineral.<br>
[0026]<br>
There are no particular limitations on the aqueous medium<br>
(c) used in the present invention provided it is able to contain<br>
the water-soluble organic monomer (a) and the water-swellable<br>
clay mineral (b), and allows the obtaining of an<br>
organic/inorganic composite hydrogel having satisfactory<br>
mechanical properties as a result of polymerization by an energy<br>
beam. For example, it may be an aqueous solution containing<br>
water and a solvent and/or other compound miscible with water,<br><br>
and is able to contain, in particular, a preservative or<br>
antimicrobial, colorant, fragrance, enzyme, protein, sugars,<br>
amino acids, cells, DNA, salts, water-soluble organic solvent,<br>
surfactant or leveling agent.<br>
[0027]<br>
Examples of the non-water-soluble polymerization<br>
initiator (d) used in the present invention include<br>
acetophenones such as p-tert-butyl trichloroacetophenone,<br>
benzophenones such as 4,4'-bisdimethylaminobenzophenone,<br>
ketones such as 2-methylthioxanthone, benzoin ethers such as<br>
benzoin methyl ether, a-hydroxyketones such as<br>
hydroxycyclohexyl phenyl ketone,phenyl glyoxylates such as<br>
methyl benzoyl formate, and metallocenes.<br>
[0028]<br>
Non-water-soluble refers to the amount of the<br>
polymerization initiator that dissolves in water being 0.5% by<br>
weight or less. If solubility in water is excessively high,<br>
the mechanical properties of the resulting organic/inorganic<br>
composite hydrogel tend to be inadequate.<br>
[0029]<br>
In the production process of the present invention, after<br>
dispersing the non-water-soluble polymerization initiator (d)<br>
in the aqueous medium (c), it is important to polymerize this<br>
dispersion in the presence of both the organic monomer (a) and<br><br>
the water-swellable clay mineral (b) in that dispersion by<br>
irradiating with an energy beam. At this time, the<br>
polymerization initiator (d) is preferably dispersed in the<br>
aqueous medium (c) dissolved in a solvent (e) . As a result of<br>
employing this method, an organic/inorganic composite hydrogel<br>
having satisfactory mechanical properties can be obtained by<br>
irradiating with an energy beam. Conversely, in the case of<br>
using a water-soluble polymerization initiator, there are cases<br>
in which the mechanical properties of the resulting<br>
organic/inorganic composite hydrogel decrease or elution of linear polymer occurs.<br>
[0030]<br>
A water-soluble solvent capable of dissolving the<br>
non-water-soluble polymerization initiator (d) or an acrylic<br>
monomer (e-1) that dissolves the non-water-soluble<br>
polymerization initiator (d) and has a hydrophile-lipophile<br>
balance (HLB) value of 8 or more can be used for the solvent<br>
(e) of the present invention. This HLB value is the value<br>
determined according to the Davis method ("Surfactants -<br>
Properties, Applications and Chemoecology", F. Kitahara, etal.<br>
ed., Kodansha Publishing, 1979, p. 24-27). Examples of the<br>
solvent (e) include polypropylene glycol diacrylates such as<br>
tripropylene glycol diacrylate; polyethylene glycol<br>
diacrylates, polypropylene glycol acrylates such as<br><br>
pentapropylene glycol acrylate; polyethylene glycol acrylates,<br>
methoxypolyethylene glycol acrylates such as methoxyethyl<br>
acrylate and methoxytriethylene glycol acrylate; nonylphenoxy<br>
polyethylene glycol acrylates, N-substituted acrylamides such<br>
as dimethyl acrylamide; hydroxyethyl acrylate and<br>
hydroxypropyl acrylate. If the HLB value of the acrylic monomer<br>
used for the solvent (e) is 8 or more, solubility or dispersivity<br>
in the aqueous medium (c) is superior, thereby making this<br>
preferable. One or more types of these acrylic monomers can<br>
be used as a mixture.<br>
[0031]<br>
In addition, a water-soluble solvent (e2) capable of<br>
dissolving the non-water-soluble polymerization initiator (d)<br>
and having at least a certain degree of water solubility can<br>
be used "for the solvent (e) of the present invention. A<br>
water-soluble solvent here preferably refers to a solvent of<br>
which 50 g or more is able to be dissolved in 100 g of water.<br>
If the solubility in water thereof is less than 50 g, the<br>
dispersivity of the non-water-soluble polymerization<br>
initiator (d) in the aqueous medium (c) decreases, thereby<br>
resulting in cases in which the mechanical properties of the<br>
resulting organic/inorganic composite hydrogel are low.<br>
[0032]<br>
Examples of the water-soluble solvent (e2) include amides<br><br>
such as dimethylacetoamide and dimethylformamide; alcohols<br>
such as methanol and ethanol, tetrahydrofuran, and<br>
dimethylsulfoxide. These solvents may also be used as a<br>
mixture.<br>
[0033]<br>
The weight ratio (d)/(e) of the non-water-soluble<br>
polymerization initiator (d) and the solvent (e) in a solution<br>
in which the polymerization initiator (d) is dissolved in the<br>
solvent (e) is preferably 0. 001 to 0 .1 and more preferably 0 . 01<br>
to 0.05. If this ratio is 0.001 or more, since an adequate<br>
amount of radicals are generated by irradiation with an energy<br>
beam, the polymerization reaction is able to proceed favorably,<br>
and if the ratio if 0.1 or less, there is substantially no<br>
occurrence of discoloration or odor caused by the initiator,<br>
while also enabling costs to be reduced.<br>
[0034]<br>
In addition, the dispersed amount of solution in which the<br>
polymerization initiator (d) is dissolved in the solvent (e)<br>
relative to the total weight of the water-soluble organic<br>
monomer (a) , the water-swellable clay mineral (b) , the aqueous<br>
solvent (c), polymerization initiator (d) and the organic<br>
solvent (e) is preferably 0.1 to 5% by weight and more preferably .<br>
0 . 2 to 2% by weight. If this dispersed amount is 0.1% by weight<br>
more, polymerization is adequately initiated, while if this<br><br>
amount is less than 5% by weight, problems such as the formation<br>
of linear polymers not involved in the organic/inorganic<br>
composite hydrogel, the generation of odor caused by an increase<br>
in the amount of polymerization initiator in the gel, and<br>
re-aggregation of the initially dispersed polymerization<br>
initiator or solution of the polymerization initiator and the<br>
solvent (e), can be reduced, thereby making this preferable<br>
since it allows the obtaining of a homogeneous<br>
organic/inorganic composite hydrogel.<br>
[0035]<br>
In order to obtain an organic/inorganic composite hydrogel<br>
in the present invention having satisfactory mechanical<br>
properties, the solution in which the polymerization initiator<br>
(d) is dissolved in the solvent (e) is preferably dispersed in<br>
the aqueous medium (c) at 1 µm or less, particularly preferably<br>
at 0.1 µm or less, and most preferably at 0.01 µm or less. If<br>
dispersed at 1 µm or less, the reaction solution easily becomes<br>
homogeneous, thereby making this preferable since the<br>
homogeneity and transparency of the organic/inorganic<br>
composite hydrogel can be improved.<br>
[0036]<br>
Examples of energy beams used in the present invention<br>
include an electron beam, gamma rays, X-rays, ultraviolet rays<br>
and visible light. In particular, ultraviolet rays are used<br><br>
preferably in consideration of the simplicity of the apparatus<br>
and ease of handling. The intensity of the irradiated<br>
ultraviolet rays is preferably 10 to 500 mW/cm2, and the<br>
irradiation time is typically about 0.1 to 200 seconds.<br>
Although oxygen acts as an inhibitor of polymerization in the<br>
case of ordinary radical polymerization by heating, in the<br>
present invention, it is not necessary to prepare the solution<br>
and carry out polymerization by irradiation with an energy beam<br>
in an atmosphere isolated from oxygen, but rather these can be<br>
carried out in an air atmosphere. However, there are cases in<br>
which irradiating with ultraviolet rays in an inert gas<br>
atmosphere is desirable since it allows the polymerization rate<br>
to be further increased.<br>
[0037]<br>
The production process of the inorganic/organic composite<br>
hydrogel of the present invention consists of shaping a reaction<br>
solution containing the water-soluble organic monomer (a) , the<br>
water-swellable clay mineral (b) , the aqueous medium (c) , the<br>
polymerization initiator (d) and the solvent (e) into an<br>
arbitrary form (such as a plate, sheet, thin film, rod, sphere,<br>
fiber or hollow fiber) and irradiating with an energy beam to<br>
polymerize the water-soluble organic monomer (a) .. In addition,<br>
an organic/inorganic composite hydrogel can also be produced<br>
in the form of a single sheet or continuous sheets by using a<br><br>
belt-shaped support.<br>
[0038]<br>
Examples of supports that can be used include metal, ceramic,<br>
glass, plastic, fabric, non-woven fabric, paper and wood. The<br>
sheet-like gel may ultimately be peeled from the support or it<br>
may used while still integrated with the support.<br>
[0039]<br>
Moreover, an organic/inorganic composite hydrogel having<br>
an arbitrary pattern can also be produced if the aforementioned<br>
reaction solution is coated onto a support and then irradiated<br>
with an energy beam through a mask. An ultrafine pattern can<br>
be obtained on the micrometer level or lower.<br>
[00.40]<br>
In particular, the production process of the present<br>
invention is suitable for forming a coated film comprising an<br>
organic/inorganic composite hydrogel, and a coated film<br>
comprising an organic/inorganic composite hydrogel having<br>
superior mechanical properties can be easily produced by<br>
coating an energy beam-curable composition (X), containing a<br>
dispersion in which the non-water-soluble polymerization<br>
initiator (d) is dispersed in the water-soluble organic monomer<br>
(a), the water-swellable clay mineral (b) and the aqueous medium<br>
(c), onto a substrate followed by irradiating with an energy<br>
beam.<br><br>
[0041]<br>
In addition, a coated film comprising a dried<br>
organic/inorganic composite hydrogel can be produced by producing the aforementioned coated film, washing as necessary,<br>
and removing the solvent by drying and so forth.<br>
[0042]<br>
[Cell Culture Substrate]<br>
The cell culture substrate of the present invention<br>
comprises an organic/inorganic composite hydrogel having a<br>
three-dimensional network structure composed of a polymer of<br>
the water-soluble organic monomer (a) and the water-swellable<br>
clay mineral (b), and preferably comprises the<br>
organic/inorganic composite hydrogel formed by irradiation<br>
with an energy beam.<br>
. [0043] <br>
The water-soluble organic monomer (a) and the<br>
water-swellable clay mineral (b) used here are the same as those<br>
previously described. A water-soluble organic monomer that<br>
imparts a polymer having both water solubility or<br>
hydrophilicity for absorbing water and hydrophobicity is<br>
particularly effective for the water-soluble organic monomer<br>
(a) since cultured cells can be easily separated from the<br>
resulting cell culture substrate. A water-soluble organic<br>
monomer that enables the hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity of<br><br>
the polymer in an aqueous solution to change with temperature,<br>
pH, solute concentration and solvent composition is used<br>
particularly preferably. More specifically, in the case of<br>
temperature, for example, polymers having a lower critical<br>
solution temperature (LCST) at which it becomes hydrophobic at<br>
or above the critical temperature (Tc), and polymers having an<br>
upper critical solution temperature (UCST) at which it becomes<br>
hydrophilic at or above the Tc are used preferably. In addition,<br>
in the case of solute concentration, for example, polymers that<br>
become hydrophobic at or above a certain concentration of sodium<br>
chloride in the solvent and become hydrophilic below that<br>
concentration at a certain temperature are also used preferably.<br>
Moreover, in the case of solvent composition, for example,<br>
polymers that become hydrophobic when the concentration of<br>
methanol relative to water in the solvent reaches a certain<br>
concentration, and become hydrophilic below that certain<br>
concentration at a certain temperature are also used<br>
preferably.<br>
[0044]<br>
Since the organic/inorganic composite hydrogel used in the<br>
cell culture substrate of the present invention is such that<br>
the polymer of the water-swellable clay mineral (b) and the<br>
water-soluble organic monomer (a) has a three-dimensional<br>
network structure, it has the characteristic of allowing cells<br><br>
to retain their shape without being destroyed when detached from<br>
the organic/inorganic composite hydrogel following culturing.<br>
In addition, in the case it is necessary to transport the cells<br>
to the location of a subsequent experiment following culturing,<br>
the organic/inorganic composite hydrogel used in the cell<br>
culture substrate of the present invention enables the cells<br>
to be transported without destroying the cultured cell sheet.<br>
This organic/inorganic composite hydrogel is able to realize<br>
a tensile modulus of 1 kPa or more, tensile strength of 20 kPa<br>
or more, and fracture elongation of 50% or more at a moisture<br>
content of 90%, and a composite hydrogel having these properties<br>
can be used preferably. In addition, a tensile modulus of 5<br>
kPa or more, tensile strength of 50 kPa or more and fracture<br>
elongation of 50% or more are more preferable, while a tensile<br>
modulus of 10 kPa or more, tensile strength of 80 kPa or more<br>
and fracture elongation of 100% or more are even more preferable.<br>
An organic/inorganic composite hydrogel having such mechanical<br>
properties allows the obtaining of a surface status suitable<br>
for cell culturing. In addition, an organic/inorganic<br>
composite hydrogel having such mechanical properties under<br>
conditions of a water content of 90% retains superior mechanical<br>
properties even in a state of exhibiting hydrophobicity during<br>
cell culturing, and demonstrates superior shape stability,<br>
handling, mobility and so forth regardless of its form following<br><br>
cell culturing.<br>
[0045]<br>
This organic/inorganic composite hydrogel has<br>
hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity corresponding to external<br>
environmental conditions due to the polymer of the<br>
water-soluble organic monomer (a) that forms a<br>
three-dimensional network structure. Consequently, a cell<br>
culture substrate comprising this organic/inorganic composite<br>
hydrogel is able to preferably culture cells and allow cultured<br>
cells to be detached and recovered both easily and rapidly<br>
without causing destruction of the cultured cells or separation<br>
and contamination by the substrate.<br>
[0046]<br>
Although the inorganic/organic composite hydrogel used in<br>
the cell culture substrate of the present invention is obtained<br>
by polymerization of the water-soluble organic monomer (a) as<br>
a result of irradiating the water-soluble organic monomer (a)<br>
with radiation in the presence of the water-swellable clay<br>
mineral uniformly dispersed in water, polymerization by<br>
irradiation is ordinarily carried out using a polymerization<br>
initiator. At this time, the polymerization initiator is<br>
preferably uniformly dispersed, and is more preferably<br>
uniformly dispersed on the surface or in the vicinity thereof<br>
of the water-swellable clay mineral (b) uniformly dispersed in<br><br>
water. As a result of irradiating such an aqueous solution with<br>
radiation, an organic/inorganic composite hydrogel can be<br>
obtained in which the water-swellable clay mineral (b) is<br>
uniformly dispersed, thereby allowing the obtaining of a cell<br>
culture substrate having superior cell culturing performance.<br>
An example of a method for uniformly dispersing the<br>
polymerization initiator is described above.<br>
[0047]<br>
There are no particular limitations on the cells capable<br>
of being cultured using the cell culture substrate of the<br>
present invention provided they are human or animal tissue cells,<br>
and examples of such cells include vascular cells, fibroblasts,<br>
muscle cells, nerve cells, chondrocytes, osteoblasts, liver<br>
cells, pancreas cells and cornea cells. Among these, vascular<br>
endothelial cells, skin fibroblasts, hepatic parenchymal cells,<br>
hepatic cancer cells and chondrocytes are used preferably. In<br>
particular, the present invention can be preferably used to<br>
culture, for example, skin fibroblasts, vascular endothelial<br>
cells and chondrocytes.<br>
[0048]<br>
In addition to being used alone, the organic/inorganic<br>
composite hydrogel used in the cell culture substrate of the<br>
present invention is also used by coating onto a support having<br>
a smooth surface or irregular surface such as metal, ceramic,<br><br>
plastic, fabric, non-woven fabric, paper or wood. In addition,<br>
the composite hydrogel can be formed into various shapes to<br>
realize enhanced mechanical properties, and can be used in the<br>
form of a sheet, fibers, hollow fibers or spheres. The polymer<br>
hydrogel coated onto the support may be ultimately peeled from<br>
the support or may be used integrated with the support.<br>
[0049]<br>
In the production of the cell culture substrate of the<br>
present invention, cell culture substrates having various sizes<br>
and shapes can be prepared by changing the shape of the<br>
polymerization vessel at the time of polymerization or cutting<br>
the gel after polymerization. For example, cell culture<br>
substrates can be prepared having an arbitrary shape such as<br>
fibers, rods, disks, cylinders, hollow shapes, spirals or<br>
spheres. In addition, the cell culture substrate can also be<br>
produced in the form of fine particles by using a method such<br>
as having a commonly used surfactant present during the<br>
polymerization reaction. In addition, the cell culture<br>
substrate of the present invention is preferably used by<br>
layering over a non-hydrophilic support such as a plastic or<br>
glass Petri dish routinely used for cell culturing. Such a<br>
laminated member may be polymerized on the support and used<br>
directly for cell culturing, or it may be polymerized in another<br>
vessel followed using for cell culturing after filling onto a<br><br>
substrate surface.<br>
The organic/inorganic composite hydrogel used in the cell<br>
culture substrate of the present invention has the<br>
characteristic of being able to be formed at an arbitrary-<br>
thickness when formed into various shapes, and when used by<br>
coating onto a support in particular, the thickness following<br>
irradiation is preferably 1000 µm or less and more preferably<br>
10 to 500 µm for reasons such as ease of preparation, reduction<br>
of the amount of residual monomer following polymerization by<br>
irradiation, and ease of separation from the support.<br>
[0050]<br>
A commonly known, ordinary organic crosslinking agent may<br>
also be used during production of the organic/inorganic<br>
composite hydrogel for the purpose of improving the properties<br>
thereof. There are no particular limitations on the organic<br>
crosslinking agent used, and can be selected according to the<br>
purpose of use. Examples of organic crosslinking agents that<br>
can be used include bifunctional compounds such as<br>
N,N'-methylene bisacrylamide, N,N'-propylene bisacrylamide,<br>
di(acrylamidomethyl) ether, 1,2-diacrylamidoethylene glycol,<br>
1,3-diacryloyl ethylene urea, ethylene diacrylate,<br>
N,N' -diallyl tartar diamide and N,N' -bisacrylyl cystamine; and<br>
trifunctional compounds such as triallyl cyanurate or triallyl<br>
isocyanurate.<br><br>
[0051]	<br>
The cell culture substrate of the present invention can<br>
be obtained in the form of a dried cell culture substrate by<br>
forming the organic/inorganic composite hydrogel on a support<br>
and washing as necessary followed by drying while affixed to<br>
the support. In addition, a dried cell culture support can also<br>
be obtained by peeling the organic/inorganic composite hydrogel<br>
formed on the support from the support, washing as necessary<br>
and then drying.<br>
[0052]<br>
A surface status suitable for cell culturing can be obtained<br>
for the cell culture substrate of the present invention by<br>
converting to a dry form. Moreover, when using as a cell culture<br>
substrate, by immersing the dried cell culture substrate in a<br>
liquid cell culture medium, the liquid culture medium can be<br>
absorbed by the cell culture substrate, thereby easily<br>
obtaining a cell culture substrate having a moisture content<br>
suitable for cell culturing. The water content at this time<br>
differs from the water content of the cell culture substrate<br>
prior to drying, and by changing the ratio of the polymer of<br>
the water-soluble organic monomer and the clay mineral in the<br>
organic/inorganic composite hydrogel that composes the cell<br>
culture substrate, and reversibly changing the hydrophilic and<br>
hydrophobic status of the organic/inorganic composite hydrogel,<br><br>
the water content can be arbitrarily controlled over a wide<br>
range. In particular, by immersing the organic/inorganic<br>
composite hydrogel in a medium at a higher temperature than the<br>
lower critical solution temperature of the organic/inorganic<br>
composite hydrogel, the water content thereof is controlled to<br>
a water content suitable for cell culturing, and that having<br>
a weight ratio of solvent to the dried cell culture substrate<br>
of 0.01 to 5 is used preferably, while that having a ratio of<br>
0 . 01 to 1 is used more preferably. If the weight ratio is within<br>
this range, the surface of the organic/inorganic composite<br>
hydrogel in terms of smoothness, water content and so forth is<br>
suitable for cell culturing, and is able to demonstrate superior<br>
culturing characteristics for various types of cells.<br>
[0053]<br>
Although it is necessary to sterilize the cell culture<br>
substrate prior to use for cell culturing, this sterilization<br>
step can be carried out with irradiation, autoclaving or gas<br>
sterilization and so forth of the organic/inorganic composite<br>
hydrogel. Among these, irradiation with gamma rays and so forth<br>
is used more preferably, and irradiation of a dried polymer<br>
hydrogel can be carried out particularly preferably. As a<br>
result, the cell culture substrate can be sterilized without<br>
significantly decreasing the properties of the<br>
organic/inorganic composite hydrogel and without allowing<br><br>
substances to remain that have a detrimental effect on cells.<br>
[0054]<br>
When producing the organic/inorganic composite hydrogel,<br>
in addition to the water-soluble organic monomer, polymer or<br>
low molecular weight compounds can be contained as additives<br>
within a range that does not impair the effects of the present<br>
invention. Examples of such compounds that can be added include<br>
cell adhesion factors such as collagen and hyaluronic acid, cell<br>
growth factors and hydroxyapatite particles.<br>
[0055]<br>
As has been described above, the cell culture substrate<br>
of the present invention is comprised of an organic/inorganic<br>
composite hydrogel having a three-dimensional network<br>
structure obtained by polymerizing the water-soluble organic<br>
monomer (a) in the presence of the water-swellable clay mineral<br>
(b) uniformly dispersed in water. Consequently, that in which<br>
the clay mineral is uniformly dispersed in the<br>
organic/inorganic composite hydrogel is obtained over a wide<br>
range of the clay mineral content, and since the<br>
organic/inorganic composite hydrogel can be controlled to a<br>
state that is suitable for cell adhesion and spreading, it has<br>
superior culturing performance. In addition, as a result of<br>
having superior flexibility and toughness, the shape of<br>
cultured cells can be retained even when transporting with the<br><br>
substrate, thereby making it possible to stably transport<br>
cultured cells. Moreover, in the case of, for example,<br>
co-culturing following initial cell culturing, culturing can<br>
be repeated without contamination by culture liquid or<br>
chemicals.<br>
[0056]<br>
Since a cell culture substrate comprising a polymer<br>
hydrogel in which hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity change<br>
reversibly according to the external environment demonstrates<br>
superior adhesion with cells under hydrophobic conditions,<br>
cells can be suitably cultured and grown. In addition, since<br>
adhesion with cells can be decreased under hydrophilic<br>
conditions, cells can be detached without using a protein<br>
hydrolase such as trypsin or chemical agent, thereby enabling<br>
cells to be recovered easily without causing destruction of the<br>
cells or separation and contamination by the substrate.<br>
Moreover, since the change from hydrophobicity to<br>
hydrophilicity or from hydrophilicity to hydrophobicity occurs<br>
rapidly, the effect on cells is minimal when changes such as<br>
temperature are made to the external environment.<br>
[0057]<br>
In particular, an organic/inorganic composite hydrogel<br>
coated film obtained by polymerizing the water-soluble organic<br>
monomer (a) with an energy beam is able to preferably<br><br>
demonstrate the superior properties described above even while<br>
in the form of a thin film.<br>
[0058]<br>
[Antifogging Material]<br>
The antifogging material of the present invention is<br>
comprised of a dried organic/inorganic composite hydrogel<br>
having a three-dimensional network structure composed of a<br>
polymer of the water-soluble organic monomer (a) and the<br>
water-swellable clay mineral (b) , and can be easily produced<br>
according to the aforementioned production process. The<br>
antifogging material of the present invention is predicted to<br>
have extremely superior mechanical properties (surface<br>
hardness), transparency and antifogging performance due to<br>
electrostatic interaction, interaction of the hydrophobic<br>
portion, interaction by hydrogen bonds and coordinate bonds or<br>
a combination of interactions thereof between the polymer of<br>
the water-soluble organic monomer (a) and the water-swellable<br>
clay mineral (b).<br>
[0059]<br>
The water-soluble organic monomer (a) and the<br>
water-swellable clay mineral (b) used here are the same as<br>
previously described, and a water-soluble acrylic monomer can<br>
be used particularly preferably for the water-soluble organic<br>
monomer (a) due to the ease of production by energy beam<br><br>
polymerization and the properties of the resulting gel.<br>
[0060]<br>
In particular, acrylamide, methacrylamide or a derivative<br>
thereof (such as N- or N,N-substituted (meth)acrylamide) can<br>
be used preferably, while at least one type of monomer selected<br>
from the group consisting of the acrylic monomers represented<br>
by the aforementioned formulas (1) to (6) can be used more<br>
preferably. As a result of using these acrylic monomers, since<br>
the non-water-soluble polymerization initiator used during<br>
polymerization can be dispersed more finely and uniformly, an<br>
antifogging material having more superior properties can be<br>
obtained that is resistant to the effects of oxygen during<br>
polymerization by an energy beam.<br>
[0061]<br>
In the antifogging material of the present invention, the<br>
thickness of the dried organic/inorganic composite hydrogel is<br>
preferably within the range of 1 to 500 µm, more preferably 1<br>
to 100 urn and even more preferably 3 to 50 µm. Since a dried<br>
organic/inorganic composite hydrogel of this thickness allows<br>
facilitates the obtaining "of a homogeneous film of adequate<br>
strength while also decreasing susceptibility to deformation<br>
of the gel during drying and peeling from the substrate, the<br>
surface layer of the antifogging material is able to demonstrate<br>
superior strength and surface antifogging performance.<br><br>
[0062]<br>
In addition, since the dried organic/inorganic composite<br>
hydrogel can be easily layered on other substrates, antifogging<br>
performance can be preferably imparted to the substrate surface.<br>
In layering on another substrate, a coated film can be formed<br>
easily by carrying out energy beam polymerization on the other<br>
substrate.<br>
[0063]<br>
The substrate used in the antifogging material of the<br>
present invention is preferably a transparent substrate from<br>
the viewpoint of maintaining antifogging performance, namely<br>
transparency. Examples of substrates include glass substrates<br>
such as glass or mirrored substrates, and transparent plastics<br>
such as polycarbonate or polyethylene.<br>
[0064]<br>
The dried organic/inorganic composite hydrogel formed on<br>
the substrate can be in direct contact with the surface of the<br>
transparent substrate and integrated therewith, or the two can<br>
be integrated with a transparent primer layer or adhesive layer<br>
interposed there between. The adhesive layer is preferably a<br>
hydrophobic polymer comprising a polymer of a hydrophobic<br>
acrylic monomer in consideration of ease of production of the<br>
adhesive layer and the adhesive strength thereof.<br>
[0065]<br><br>
The hydrophobic polymer is preferably a hydrophobic<br>
polymer comprising a hydrophobic acrylic monomer due to the<br>
superior adhesion thereof with the dried organic/inorganic<br>
composite hydrogel. Specific examples of hydrophobic acrylic<br>
monomers include acrylic acid esters and epoxy esters of acrylic<br>
acid having one or more acryloyl groups in a molecule thereof,<br>
and urethane oligomers having one or more acryloyl groups in<br>
a molecule thereof.<br>
[0066]<br>
The antifogging material of the present invention can be<br>
prepared to have a wide range of hardness of the dried<br>
organic/inorganic composite hydrogel as is required in terms<br>
of wear resistance and so forth, and the surface hardness<br>
thereof preferably has a surface pencil hardness of HB or higher<br>
and particularly preferably H or higher from the viewpoint of<br>
ordinary handling ease.<br>
[0067]<br>
The antifogging performance of the antifogging material<br>
of the present invention can be adjusted by suitably adjusting<br>
the degree of hydrophilicity (water contact angle) of the<br>
surface of the dried organic/inorganic composite hydrogel.<br>
The range for particularly preferable use as an antifogging<br>
material is preferably a water contact angle of 40° or less and<br>
more preferably 20° or less for the surface of the dried<br><br>
organic/inorganic composite hydrogel. The degree of<br>
hydrophilicity of the dried gel layer can be adjusted by<br>
suitably selecting a copolymer of the polymer of the<br>
water-soluble organic monomer (a) and another hydrophobic<br>
polymer.<br>
[0068]<br>
Since the antifogging material of the present invention<br>
is a homogeneous film in which a clay mineral is uniformly<br>
dispersed in an organic polymer over a wide range of content<br>
of the clay mineral, it has superior mechanical properties<br>
(surface hardness) , antifogging performance and transparency.<br>
Moreover, since the dried organic/inorganic composite hydrogel<br>
has superior adhesion with the substrate, an antifogging<br>
material in which the dried organic/inorganic composite<br>
hydrogel and the hydrophobic polymer are covalently bonded in<br>
particular has extremely superior adhesion. In addition,<br>
since this antifogging material allows polymerization to be<br>
completed in an extremely short period of time while also being<br>
able to form a homogeneous film, it has the characteristic of<br>
having extremely high production efficiency, and is used in<br>
medical and nursing care devices as well as various types of<br>
industrial materials.<br>
[Examples]<br>
[0069]<br><br>
Although the following provides a more detailed<br>
explanation of the present invention through examples thereof,<br>
the scope of the present invention is not limited to these<br>
examples alone.<br>
[0070]<br>
Example 1 - Production of Organic/Inorganic Composite<br>
Hydrogel<br>
2 g of N,N-dimethyl acrylamide (Kohjin Co., Ltd.) in the<br>
form of the water-soluble organic monomer (a) , 0. 8 g of Laponite<br>
XLG (Rockwood Additives Ltd.) in the form of the clay mineral<br>
(b) and 20 g of water in the form of the aqueous medium (c) were<br>
uniformly mixed to prepare a reaction solution (1).<br>
[0071]<br>
98 g of polyoxypropylene monoacrylate ("Brenmer AP-400",<br>
NGF Corp.) in the form of the solvent (e) and 2 g of<br>
1-hydroxycyclohexyl phenyl ketone ("Irgacure 184", Ciba<br>
Specialty Chemicals Ltd.) in the form of the non-water-soluble<br>
polymerization initiator (d) were uniformly mixed to prepare<br>
solution (1).<br>
[0072]<br>
50 µl of the solution (1) were added to the entire volume<br>
of the aforementioned reaction solution (1) and uniformly<br>
dispersed with an ultrasonic homogenizer followed by sealing<br>
in a glass tube having an inner diameter of 5. 5 mm and irradiating<br><br>
with ultraviolet light having an ultraviolet intensity of 40<br>
mW/cm2 at 365 nm for 120 seconds to polymerize the N,N-dimethyl<br>
acrylamide and produce a rod-shaped organic/inorganic<br>
composite hydrogel (1).<br>
[0073]<br>
When the gel produced in the manner described above was<br>
analyzed using a tensile tester (Model AGS-H, Shimadzu Corp.) ,<br>
the breaking point stress was found to be 60 KPa and the breaking<br>
point strain was found to be 1950%. The resulting gel was also<br>
visually determined to be colorless and transparent.<br>

Hydrogel<br>
2.3 g of N-isopropyl acrylamide (Kohjin Co., Ltd.) in the<br>
form of the water-soluble organic monomer (a) , 0 . 8 g of Laponite<br>
XLG (Rockwood Additives Ltd.) in the form of the clay mineral<br>
(b) and 20 g of water in the form of the aqueous medium (c) were<br>
uniformly mixed to prepare a reaction solution (2).<br>
[0075]<br>
95 g of 2-hydroxyethyl acrylate (Wako Pure Chemical<br>
Industries, Ltd.) in the form of the solvent (e) and 5 g of<br>
1-hydroxycyclohexyl phenyl ketone ("Irgacure 184", Ciba<br>
Specialty Chemicals Ltd.) in the form of the non-water-soluble<br>
polymerization initiator (d) were uniformly mixed to prepare<br><br>
solution (2).<br>
[0076]<br>
100 µl of solution (2) were added to the entire volume of<br>
the aforementioned reaction solution (2) and uniformly<br>
dispersed with an ultrasonic homogenizer followed by sealing<br>
in a glass tube having an inner diameter of 5. 5 mm and irradiating<br>
with ultraviolet rays having an ultraviolet intensity of 40<br>
mW/cm2 at 365 nm for 120 seconds to polymerize the N-isopropyl<br>
acrylamide and produce a rod-shaped organic/inorganic<br>
composite hydrogel (2).<br>
[0077]<br>
When the gel produced in the manner described above was<br>
analyzed using a tensile tester (Model AGS-H, Shimadzu Corp.) ,<br>
the breaking point stress was found to be 125 KPa and the breaking<br>
point strain was found to be 1200%. The resulting gel was also<br>
visually determined to be colorless and transparent.<br>
[0078]<br>
When this gel was immersed for 165 hours in water at 20°C,<br>
the gel swelled to about 400% of its initial mass. In addition,<br>
when this swollen gel was immersed for 24 hours in water at 50°C,<br>
the gel de-swelled and returned to about 35% of its initial mass.<br>

1-hydroxycyclohexyl phenyl ketone ("Irgacure 184", Ciba<br>
Specialty Chemicals Ltd.) in the form of the non-water-soluble<br>
polymerization initiator (d) were uniformly mixed to prepare<br>
solution (3).<br>
[0081]<br>
80 µ1 of the solution (3) were added to the entire volume<br>
of the aforementioned reaction solution (3) and uniformly<br>
dispersed with an ultrasonic homogenizer followed by coating<br>
onto a glass plate to a thickness of 150 µm using a bar coater<br>
and irradiating with ultraviolet rays having an ultraviolet<br>
intensity of 40 mW/cm2 at 365 nm for 120 seconds to polymerize<br>
the 2-methoxyethyl acrylate and produce a coated film of an<br>
organic/inorganic composite hydrogel (3). The resulting gel<br>
was visually observed to be colorless and transparent.<br>
[0082]<br><br>
Example 4 - Production of Organic/Inorganic Composite<br>
Hydrogel<br>
2.8 g of 4-acryloylmorpholine (Wako Pure Chemical<br>
Industries, Ltd.) in the form of the water-soluble organic<br>
monomer (a), 1.6 g of Laponite XLG (Rockwood Additives Ltd.)<br>
in the form of the clay mineral (b) and 20 g of water in the<br>
form of the aqueous medium (c) were uniformly mixed to prepare<br>
a reaction solution (4).<br>
[0083]<br>
92 g of polyoxypropylene monoacrylate ("Brenmer AP-400",<br>
NOF Corp.) in the form of the solvent (e) and 8 g of<br>
1-hydroxycyclohexyl phenyl ketone ("Irgacure 184", Ciba<br>
Specialty Chemicals Ltd.) in the form of the non-water-soluble<br>
polymerization initiator (d) were uniformly mixed to prepare<br>
solution (4).<br>
[0084]<br>
80 µl of the solution (4) were added to the entire volume<br>
of the aforementioned reaction solution (4) and the solution<br>
was uniformly dispersed with an ultrasonic homogenizer followed<br>
by coating onto a glass plate to a thickness of 200 µm using<br>
a bar coater, irradiating with ultraviolet rays having an<br>
ultraviolet intensity of 40 mW/cm2 at 365 nm for 120 seconds<br>
through a polyethylene terephthalate (PET) mask (line width:<br>
approx. 200 µm, having black lines drawn to roughly 5 cm in<br><br>
length) to polymerize the 4-acryloylmorpholine and removing the<br>
uncured (black line) portion by rinsing with water to produce<br>
a coated film of an organic/inorganic composite hydrogel (4)<br>
having grooves in the pattern as the black lines of the mask.<br>
[0085]<br>
The gel produced in the manner described above was visually<br>
observed to be colorless and transparent.<br>
In addition, observation of the grooves with a light<br>
microscope revealed the groove width to be about 200 µm.<br>
[0086]<br>
Comparative Example 1<br>
2 g of N,N-dimethyl acrylamide (Kohjin Ltd.) in the form<br>
of a water-soluble organic monomer, 0.8 g of Laponite XLG<br>
(Rockwood Additives Ltd.) in the form of a clay mineral, 0.02<br>
g of potassium peroxodisulfate (Wako Pure Chemical Industries,<br>
Ltd.) in the form of a water-soluble polymerization initiator<br>
(peroxide) and 20 g of water in the form of an aqueous medium<br>
were uniformly mixed in air isolated from oxygen to prepare a<br>
reaction solution (l').<br>
[0087]<br>
The aforementioned reaction solution (1') was sealed in<br>
a glass tube having an inner diameter of 5.5 mm in air not<br>
isolated from oxygen and allowed to stand undisturbed for 15<br>
hours in a water bath at 20°C. However, since all of the<br><br>
aforementioned procedures were not isolated from oxygen, the<br>
solution only became slightly viscous and a gel was not<br>
obtained.<br>
[0088]<br>
Comparative Example 2<br>
2.3 g of N-isopropyl acrylamide (Kohjin Ltd.) in the form<br>
of a water-soluble organic monomer, 0.8 g of Laponite XLG<br>
(Rockwood Additives Ltd.) in the form of a clay mineral, 0.2<br>
g of 2-hydroxy-l-[4-(2-hydroxyethoxy)phenyl]-1-propane<br>
("Irgacure 2959", Ciba Specialty Chemicals Ltd.) in the form<br>
of a water-soluble polymerization initiator and 20 g of water<br>
in the form of an aqueous medium were uniformly mixed in air<br>
isolated from oxygen to prepare a reaction solution (2').<br>
[0089]<br>
The aforementioned reaction solution (2') was sealed in<br>
a glass tube having an inner diameter of 5.5 mm and polymerized<br>
by irradiating with ultraviolet light having an ultraviolet<br>
intensity of 40 mW/cm2 at 365 nm for 120 seconds. The resulting<br>
gel was visually observed to have a milky white color and be<br>
opaque. Although the gel was attempted to be analyzed using<br>
a tensile tester (Model AGS-H, Shimadzu Corp.), testing was<br>
unable to be carried out due to the excessively weak strength<br>
of the gel.<br>
[0090]<br><br>
On the basis of the results of the aforementioned Examples<br>
1 to 4 and Comparative Examples 1 and 2, according to the<br>
production process of the present invention, an<br>
organic/inorganic composite hydrogel that demonstrates<br>
superior mechanical properties, flexibility and transparency<br>
was clearly determined to be able to be produced in extremely<br>
short period of time, without having to remove oxygen, and over<br>
a wide range of a clay mineral content, by uniformly dispersing<br>
the clay mineral in an organic polymer.<br>
[0091]<br>
Example 5 - Production of Cell Culture Substrate<br>
2.2 3 g of N-isopropyl acrylamide (Kohjin Ltd.) in the form<br>
of the water-soluble organic monomer (a) , 0.8 g of Laponite XLG<br>
(Rockwood Additives Ltd.) in the form of the clay mineral (b)<br>
and 20 g of water in the form of the aqueous medium (c) were<br>
uniformly mixed to prepare a reaction solution (5).<br>
[0092]<br>
98 g of polyoxypropylene monoacrylate ("Brenmer AP-400",<br>
NOF Corp.) in the form of the solvent (e) and 2 g of<br>
1-hydroxycyclohexyl phenyl ketone ("Irgacure.184", Ciba<br>
Specialty Chemicals Ltd.) in the form of the non-water-soluble<br>
polymerization initiator (d) were uniformly mixed to product<br>
a solution (5).<br>
[0093]<br><br>
50 µl of the solution (5) were added to the entire volume<br>
of the aforementioned reaction solution (5) and uniformly<br>
dispersed with an ultrasonic homogenizer followed by coating<br>
that solution onto a polyethylene terephthalate (PET) film to<br>
a thickness of 200 µm using a bar coater and irradiating with<br>
ultraviolet rays having an ultraviolet intensity of 40 mW/cm2<br>
at 365 nm for 120 seconds to polymerize the water-soluble<br>
organic monomer and obtain a sheet-like organic/inorganic<br>
composite hydrogel (5).<br>
[0094]<br>
After the resulting sheet-like organic/inorganic<br>
composite hydrogel (5) was slightly immersed in water at.20°C<br>
and allowed to swell to adjust to a water content of 90%, the<br>
sheet-like organic/inorganic composite hydrogel (5) was peeled<br>
from the PET film so as not to damage the gel. The peeled<br>
sheet-like organic/inorganic composite hydrogel was then cut<br>
to a size of 1 cm x 5 cm and attached to a tensile tester<br>
("Benchtop Universal Tester AGS-H", Shimadzu Corp.) so as hot<br>
to slide in the chuck. As a result of then carrying out tensile<br>
testing at a distance between evaluation points of 30 mm and<br>
pulling speed of 100 mm/min, the tensile fracture strength was<br>
found to be 95 kPa and the braking elongation was found to be<br>
1010%. After carefully wiping off all water adhered to the<br>
surface of this sheet-like organic/inorganic composite<br><br>
hydrogel (5), the contact angles of the surface of the<br>
sheet-like organic/inorganic composite hydrogel (5) relative<br>
to water were measured at 20°C and 50°C using a contact angle<br>
measuring apparatus ("CA-X200", Kyowa Interface Science Co.,<br>
Ltd.) . The water contact angle at 20°C was 30° and the water<br>
contact angle at 50°C was 60°. On the basis of these results,<br>
the resulting sheet-like organic/inorganic composite hydrogel<br>
was confirmed to demonstrate both hydrophilicity and<br>
hydrophobicity according to temperature conditions.<br>
[0095]<br>
On the other hand, the sheet-like organic/inorganic<br>
composite hydrogel (5) was then immersed for 2 days in 2 liters<br>
of ultrapure water at 20°C, removed after the hydrogel was<br>
allowed to swell, immersed again for 2 days in 1 liter of<br>
ultrapure water at 50°C and then removed after the hydrogel was<br>
allowed to de-swell. After repeating this washing<br>
purification procedure 3 times, the purified sheet-like<br>
organic/inorganic composite hydrogel (5) was cut to a diameter<br>
of 8 cm to obtain a cell culture substrate (A) . This was then<br>
transferred to a cell, culture dish ("Falcon 3003",<br>
Becton-Dickinson Labware Inc.), covered and allowed to stand<br>
undisturbed at 37°C. Furthermore, all procedures from<br>
purification to transfer of the cell culture substrate (A) to<br><br>
the cell culture dish were carried out in a Clean Bench.<br>
[0096]<br>
[Culturing Test]<br>
Cells were cultured using the cell culture dish containing<br>
the cell culture substrate (A) obtained in the manner described<br>
above. Cancer cell line cells HepG2 derived from human liver<br>
epithelial cells (Dainippon Sumitomo Pharma Co., Ltd.) were<br>
used for the cultured cells. Culturing was carried out using<br>
minimum essential Eagle's medium (Sigma) containing 10% fetal<br>
calf serum (ICN) (containing as additives pyruvic acid (ICN)<br>
and non-essential amino acids (ICN)) in a 37°C incubator<br>
containing 5% carbon dioxide. In addition, two dishes<br>
containing the cell culture substrate (A) were prepared, and<br>
simultaneously inoculated under the same conditions. One week<br>
after inoculation, one of the dishes containing the cell culture<br>
substrate (A) was allowed to stand undisturbed for 5 minutes<br>
in a 20°C constant temperature chamber followed by observing<br>
the surface thereof with a light microscope to confirm that the<br>
cells had adhered to the cell culture substrate (A) and grown<br>
sufficiently. The cell culture substrate (A) together with the<br>
cultured cells were removed from the dish containing the other<br>
cell culture substrate (A) used for culturing, and transferred<br>
to a tissue culture dish containing minimum essential Eagle's<br>
medium containing 10% fetal calf serum pre-warmed to a<br><br>
temperature of 20°C. After covering and allowing to stand<br>
undisturbed for 10 minutes at 20°C, the cells were able to be<br>
detached from the cell culture substrate (A) by grabbing the<br>
cells that had grown on the cell culture substrate (A) with a<br>
tweezers. At this time, there was no damage to the cell culture<br>
substrate (A), and the cell culture substrate (A) was not<br>
observed to be adhered to the detached cells. After separating<br>
into individual cells by treating the detached cells with<br>
trypsin-EDTA, a count of viable cells as determined by Trypan<br>
blue staining confirmed that the 2.0 x 106 cells at the start<br>
of culturing had increased to 1.9 x 108 cells after culturing.<br>
[0097]<br>
Example 6 - Culturing Test<br>
Cells were cultured using the cell culture dish containing<br>
the cell culture substrate (A) obtained in the aforementioned<br>
Example 5. Normal human skin fibroblasts (Dainippon Sumitomo<br>
Pharma Co., Ltd.) were used for the cultured cells. Culturing<br>
was carried out using CS-C medium (Dainippon Sumitomo Pharma<br>
Co., Ltd.) in a 37°C incubator containing 5% carbon dioxide.<br>
In addition, two dishes containing the cell culture substrate<br>
(A) were prepared, and simultaneously inoculated under the same<br>
conditions. One week after inoculation, one of the dishes<br>
containing the cell culture substrate (A) was allowed to stand<br>
undisturbed for 5 minutes in a 20°C constant temperature chamber<br><br>
followed by observing the surface thereof with a light<br>
microscope to confirm that the cells had adhered to the cell<br>
culture substrate (A) and grown sufficiently. The cell culture<br>
substrate (A) together with the cultured cells were removed from the dish containing the other cell culture substrate (A) used<br>
for culturing, and transferred to a tissue culture dish<br>
containing CS-C medium pre-warmed to a temperature of 20°C.<br>
After covering and allowing to stand undisturbed for 10 minutes<br>
at 20°C, the cells were able to be detached from the cell culture<br>
substrate (A) in the form of a sheet by grabbing the cells that<br>
had grown on the cell culture substrate (A) with a tweezers.<br>
At this time, there was no damage to the cell culture substrate<br>
(A) , and the cell culture substrate (A) was not observed to be<br>
adhered to the sheet-like cells. After separating into<br>
individual cells by treating the removed sheet-like cells with<br>
trypsin-EDTA, a count of viable cells as determined by Trypan<br>
blue staining confirmed that the 2.5 x 106 cells at the start<br>
of culturing had increased to 9.1 x 107 cells after culturing.<br>
[0098]<br>
Example 7 - Production of Cell Culture Substrate<br>
A nearly colorless and transparent, homogeneous sheet-like<br>
organic/inorganic composite hydrogel (6) was synthesized in the<br>
same manner as Example 5 with the exception of changing the<br>
amount of Laponite XLG added to 1.6 g. When the contact angle<br><br>
substrate (B) comprised of the dried sheet-like<br>
organic/inorganic composite hydrogel (6) .<br>
[0099]<br>
[Culturing Test]<br>
HepG2 cells were cultured using the cell culture substrate<br>
(B) obtained in this manner using the same cells, media and<br>
culturing conditions and in the same manner as Example 1. When<br>
the surface was observed with a light microscope using the same<br>
method as Example 1 one week after inoculation of the cells,<br>
the cells were confirmed to be adhered and adequately growing<br>
on the cell culture substrate (B) . After culturing the cells<br>
using another dish containing the cell culture substrate (B)<br>
in the same manner as Example 1, the cell culture substrate (B)<br>
together with the cultured cells were removed from the dish<br>
containing the cell culture substrate (B) , and transferred to<br>
a tissue culture dish containing minimum essential Eagle's<br>
medium containing 10% fetal calf serum pre-warmed to a<br>
temperature of 20°C. After covering and allowing to stand<br>
undisturbed for 10 minutes at 20°C, the cells were able to be<br>
detached from the cell culture substrate (B) by grabbing the<br>
cells that had grown on the cell culture substrate (B) with a<br>
tweezers. At this time, there was no damage to the cell culture<br>
substrate (B), and the cell culture substrate (B) was not<br>
observed to be adhered to the detached cells. A count of viable<br><br>
cells carried out in the same manner as Example 1 confirmed that<br>
the 2.0 x 106 cells at the start of culturing had increased to<br>
1.3 x 107 cells after culturing.<br>
In addition, when the hydrogel was dried and the resulting<br>
dried hydrogel was immersed in the media used in the experiment<br>
described above followed by holding for 24 hours in a 37°C<br>
incubator, the hydrogel returned to a hydrogel having a moisture<br>
content of 30%.<br>
[0100]<br>
Comparative Example 3<br>
Cells were cultured using a cell culture dish ("Falcon 3003"<br>
not subjected to any surface treatment. Culturing was carried<br>
out using the same cells, media and culturing conditions and<br>
in the same manner as Example 1. When the surface of the dish<br>
was observed with a light microscope one week after the start<br>
of culturing, the cells were confirmed to be adhered and growing.<br>
After the dish used for this culturing was placed in an incubator<br>
at 20°C and allowed to stand undisturbed for 10 minutes, although<br>
the cells were attempted to be removed from the dish, there was<br>
no detachment of the cells whatsoever. In addition, when the<br>
cultured cells were detached using trypsin in accordance with<br>
known methods, the cells ended up breaking up into individual<br>
cells and were unable to be removed in the form of a sheet.<br>
[0101]<br><br>
with respect to water at 20°C and 50°C was measured in the same<br>
manner as Example 1 using the resulting sheet-like<br>
organic/inorganic composite hydrogel (6), the water contact<br>
angle at 20°C was found to be 29° and that at 50°C was found to<br>
be 45°, thus confirming that the resulting sheet-like<br>
organic/inorganic composite hydrogel (6) exhibits both<br>
hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity according to temperature<br>
conditions. The resulting sheet-like organic/inorganic<br>
composite hydrogel (6) was then immersed for 2 days in 1 liter<br>
of ultrapure water at 20°C and removed after the hydrogel was<br>
allowed to swell, followed by immersing for 2 days in 1 liter<br>
of ultrapure water at 50°C and removed after the hydrogel was<br>
allowed to de-swell. After repeating this washing<br>
purification procedure 3 times, the edges of the purified<br>
sheet-like organic/inorganic composite hydrogel (6) were<br>
immobilized with clips so as not to deform the four sides thereof<br>
and allowed to dry for 3 days inside a Clean Bench. The<br>
resulting dried hydrogel was placed in a gas-impermeable<br>
plastic bag and sealed and irradiated with gamma rays (radiation<br>
source: Cobalt 60, Radia Industry Co., Ltd.). The radiation<br>
dose was 25 kGy. There was no particular deformation or<br>
discoloration observed in the dried hydrogel following<br>
irradiation. Following irradiation with gamma rays, the dried<br>
hydrogel was cut to a diameter of 8 cm to obtain a cell culture<br><br>
As shown in the aforementioned Examples 5 to 7, due to its<br>
flexibility and toughness, the cell culture substrate of the<br>
present invention enabled cells to be recovered without<br>
damaging the cells and without allowing the cells to be<br>
contaminated by the substrate during separation and recovery<br>
of cultured cells. Moreover, since the hydrophilicity and<br>
hydrophobicity of the cell culture substrate reversibly change<br>
according to the external environment, the cultured cells were<br>
able to be recovered rapidly. On the other hand, as shown in<br>
Comparative Example 3, cell culture substrates of the prior art<br>
resulted in severing of bonds between the cells and substrate<br>
during cell recovery, while also causing bonds between cells<br>
to be severed, thereby preventing the cells from being removed<br>
in a proliferating state. Moreover, in Comparative Example 4,<br>
the shape of the culture substrate was unable to be maintained.<br>
[0104]<br>
Example 8 - Production of Antifogging Coated Film<br>
2 g of N,N-dimethyl acrylamide (Kohjin Co., Ltd.) in the<br>
form of the water-soluble organic monomer (a) , 0 . 8 g of Laponite<br>
XLG (Rockwood Additives Ltd.) in the form of the clay mineral<br>
(b) and 20 g of water in the form of the aqueous medium (c) were<br>
uniformly mixed to prepare a reaction solution (7).<br>
[0105]<br>
98 g of polyoxypropylene monoacrylate ("Brenmer AP-400",<br><br>
Comparative Example 4<br>
An organic crosslinked hydrogel was polymerized in the same<br>
manner as Example 1 with the exception of not using a claymineral<br>
and adding an organic crosslinking agent after adding NIPA<br>
monomer at 5 mol% of the monomer. N, N' -methylene bisacrylamide<br>
(Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd.) was used as is for the<br>
organic crosslinking agent. As a result, a sheet-like hydrogel<br>
was obtained that became white at 20°C. Although the resulting<br>
sheet-like hydrogel was transferred to a cell culture dish after<br>
purifying in the same manner as Example 1, since the hydrogel<br>
was extremely brittle, purification and transfer were difficult.<br>
In addition, the contact angle of this sheet-like hydrogel was<br>
4 9° when held at a temperature of 50°C.<br>
[0102]<br>
Next, cells were cultured in the same manner as Example<br>
2 using the cell culture dish containing this sheet-like<br>
hydrogel. When a portion of the sheet-like hydrogel in the dish<br>
was removed one week after the start of culturing and stained<br>
with Trypan blue, the cells were not confirmed to be growing<br>
on the sheet-like hydrogel. In addition, although this<br>
sheet-like hydrogel was attempted to be removed from the dish,<br>
the sheet-like hydrogel ended up breaking and was unable to be<br>
removed.<br>

polymerization initiator (d) were uniformly mixed to prepare<br>
solution (7).<br>
[0106]<br>
50 µl of the solution (7) were added to the entire volume<br>
of the aforementioned reaction solution (7) and uniformly<br>
dispersed with an ultrasonic homogenizer followed by coating<br>
onto a 3 mm thick glass plate to a thickness of 150 µm using<br>
a bar coater and irradiating with ultraviolet rays having an<br>
ultraviolet intensity of 40 mW/cm2 at 365 nm for 120 seconds<br>
to polymerize the N,N-dimethyl acrylamide and produce an<br>
organic/inorganic composite hydrogel (7) on the glass plate.<br>
[0107]<br>
The aforementioned organic/inorganic composite hydrogel<br>
(7) was dried for 20 minutes with a hot air dryer at 80°C to<br>
produce an antifogging coated film (X) laminated on the glass<br>
plate.<br>
[0108]<br>
The antifogging coated film (X) produced in the manner<br>
described above was visually determined to be colorless and<br>
transparent. The surface hardness on the dried gel side of the<br>
antifogging coated film (X) as measured using the pencil method<br><br>
was H. The water contact angle as measured using a contact angle<br>
measuring apparatus ("CA-X200", Kyowa Interface Science Co.,<br>
Ltd.) was 31°.<br>
[0109]<br>
[Antifogging Performance Test]<br>
The antifogging coated film (X) prepared in the manner<br>
described above was placed over a 200 ml beaker containing 100<br>
ml of hot water at 60°C so that the dried gel was facing downward<br>
and the film was confirmed not to fog for 1 minute. The dried<br>
gel did not swell and did not separate from the glass after<br>
testing.<br>

[0112]<br>
100 µl of the solution (8) were added to the entire volume<br>
of the aforementioned reaction solution (8) and uniformly<br>
dispersed with an ultrasonic homogenizer followed by coating<br>
onto a polycarbonate plate (thickness: 3 mm) pre-coated with<br>
an adhesive layer in the form of hydrophobic urethane acrylate<br>
(V-4263, Dainippon Ink &amp; Chemicals Inc.) containing 2% by weight<br>
of 1-hydroxycyclohexyl phenyl ketone to a thickness of 20 urn,<br>
and irradiating with ultraviolet rays having an ultraviolet<br>
intensity of 40 mW/cm2 at 365 nm for 120 seconds to polymerize<br>
the adhesive layer and the N-isopropyl acrylamide and produce<br>
an organic/inorganic composite hydrogel (8) on a substrate<br>
having an adhesive layer.<br>
[0113]<br>
The aforementioned organic/inorganic composite hydrogel<br>
(8) was dried for 20 minutes with a hot air dryer at 80°C to<br>
produce an antifogging coated film (Y).<br>
[0114]<br>

[INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY]<br>
Since the production process of the present invention<br>
eliminates the need for a step for removing oxygen, it enables<br>
an organic/inorganic composite hydrogel to be easily produced,<br>
and since the hydrogel can be produced in an extremely short<br>
period of time by irradiating with an energy beam, an<br>
organic/inorganic composite hydrogel can be advantageously<br>
obtained in terms of production equipment and cost.<br>
In addition, since the organic/inorganic composite<br>
hydrogel coated film, dried coated film and antifogging coated<br><br>
film of the present invention demonstrate superior mechanical<br>
properties, flexibility and so forth as a result of a clay<br>
mineral being uniformly dispersed in an organic polymer, they<br>
are useful as materials for medical and nursing care devices<br>
as well as various types of industrial materials. In particular,<br>
since a cell culture substrate composed of the<br>
organic/inorganic composite hydrogel of the present invention<br>
has superior flexibility and toughness while also being able<br>
to rapidly respond to changes in the external environment, it<br>
has considerable industrial significance since cells can be<br>
recovered easily without having an effect on the cells.<br><br>
