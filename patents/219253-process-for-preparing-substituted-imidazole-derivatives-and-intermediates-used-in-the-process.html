FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a new process for preparing substituted imidazole derivatives of formula (I) and acid addition salts thereof,<br><br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The compounds of the above-mentioned formula (I) are highly selective and long-acting antagonists of a2-adrenoceptors and they have a good peroral bioavailability. The compounds are especially valuable in the xeatment of cognitive disorders. Compounds of formula (I) have been jescribed in patent publication EP 0 618 906 B1. Specific examples of such compounds are 4-(2-ethyl-5-fluoroindan-2-yl)-1 H-imidazole and 4-(5-:luoroindan-2-yl)-1 H-imidazole.<br>
The above-mentioned publication EP 0 618 906 B1 also discloses nethods of preparing compounds of formula (I). Said methods relate to various vays of modifying the substituents in the benzene moiety of the indan ring system. There is no disclosure of a total synthesis, which would lead to the iesired compounds in good yield.<br>
Publication EP 0 310 745 B1 discloses a process for preparing<br>
compounds of formula (I), wherein the last step of the process comprises the<br>
jse  of formamide for the formation  of the  imidazole  ring.  The   use of<br>
ormamide, however, requires severe reaction conditions, which should be<br>
jvoided in connection with industrial production in large scale.<br>
■<br><br>
Although the individual steps of the process according to the present invention are known as such (see e.g. EP 0 146 228 B1), it has now surprisingly been found that compounds of formula (I) can be prepared, also in large scale, in very good yields by using the synthesis route described below.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a process for preparing substituted imidazole derivatives of formula (I) and acid addition salts thereof<br><br>
in which formula Y is -CH2- or-CO-, Ri is H, halogen or hydroxy, R2 is H or halogen and R3 is H or lower alkyl, comprising the steps of<br>
a)	halogenating a compound of formula (II)<br><br>
wherein Y, R1T R2 and R3 are as defined above, to obtain a compound of formula (III) <br>
wherein Y, R1, R2 and R3 are as defined above and X is halogen,<br>
b)	reacting the compound of formula (III) thus obtained with an amine of<br>
formula R4NH2| wherein R4 is an easily removable leaving group, and an alkali<br>
metal thiocyanate, to obtain a compound of formula (IV)<br><br><br>
wherein Y, R1f R2) R3 and R4 are as defined above,<br>
c)	removing the mercapto group from the compound of formula (IV) to obtain a<br>
compound of formula (V)<br><br>
wherein Y, R1, R2f R3 and R4 are as defined above,<br>
d)	removing the group R4 from the compound of formula (V) to obtain a compound of formula (I), and, if desired,<br>
e)	converting the resulting compound of formula (I) into an acid addition salt thereof.<br>
Further the invention relates to a process for preparing a compound of formula (IV) <br>
wherein Y is -CH2- or -CO-, R1 is H, halogen or hydroxy, R2 is H or halogen and R3 is H or lower alkyl, comprising reacting a compound of formula (III)<br><br><br>
wherein Y, R1, R2 and R3 are as defined above and X is halogen, with an amine of formula R4NH2, wherein R4 is an easily removable leaving group, and an alkali metal thiocyanate.<br>
The invention also relates to intermediate compound (IV) wherein Y, R1. R2. R3 and R4 are as defined above.<br>

3,8 g of 2-acetyl-2-ethyl-5-fluoroindan and 35 ml of methanol were placed into a round-bottomed flask equipped with a thermometer, a mechanical stirrer and a dropping funnel. The reaction mixture was cooled in a cooling bath while stirring to a temperature between -5 °C and -8 °C and 0,7 ml of a Br2-solution in a small amount of methanol was added dropwise. The cooling bath was removed and the reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for 2 hours.

1,62 g of 2-bromo-1-(2-ethyl-5-fluoro-indan-2-yl)-ethanone was dissolved in 25 ml of ethanol in a glass round-bottomed flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer, a thermometer and a dropping funnel. The reaction mixture was heated to reflux temperature while stirring. 0.366 g of benzylamine dissolved in 5 ml ethanol was added slowly in a drop-wise fashion to the solution. After the addition of benzylamine the mixture was refluxed for one hour. 0,330 g of potassium thiocyanate was added portionwise during 30<br><br>
minutes and the reaction mixture was refluxed for 2 hours. The reaction mixture was evaporated to dryness before 150 ml ethyl acetate was added and the solution was washed with water. The organic phase was dried over Na2S04l filtered and evaporated providing 1,13 g of 1-benzyl-5-(2-ethyl-5-fluoro-indan--2-yl)-imidazole-2-thiol (yield 31 %). The analytical sample was purified using TLC-plates. The purity was measured by HPLC: 62 %. Normally the crude product was used in the following step.<br>

53 mg of 1-benzyl-5-(2-ethyi-5-fluoro-indan~2-yl)-imidazole, 20 mg of Pd/C, 51 mg of ammonium formate and 2 ml of ethanol were added under nitrigen atmosphere into a round-bottomed flask equipped with a thermometer and a stirring bar. The reaction mixture was stirred at reflux temperature for 6 hours. The mixture was filtered and the filter (Celite™) was washed with ethanol. The reaction mixture was placed back into a round-bottomed flask and an additional 20 mg of Pd/C and 51 mg of ammonium formate were added under nitrogen atmosphere. The mixture was heated to reflux temperature and refluxed for 2 hours. Then the mixture was cooled to room temperature and filtered. The filter (Celite™) was washed with ethanol and after evaporation to dryness, whereby 4-(2-ethyl-5-fluoro-indan-2-yl)-1H-imidazole was obtained. The analytical sample was purified using TLC-plates. The purity was measured by HPLC: 60 %. Normally the crude product was used in the following step.<br>

The reaction mixture was stirred at reflux temperature for about 14 hours. After filtration and evaporation crude 4-(2-ethyl-5-fluoro-indan-2-yl)-1H-imidazole was obtained.<br><br><br><br>
A HCi/methanol reagent was prepared by bubbling HC!-gas through methanol. 100 mg of 4-(2-3thyI-5-fluoro-indan-2-yl)-1 H-imidazole was dissolved in 2 ml methanol in a round-bottomed flask. 2 ml of HCI/methanol reagent (3 M) was added slowly to the solution while stirring. During the addition the internal temperature of the mixture was kept below 29 °C by cooling. The resulting mixture was evaporated at a temperature between 35 °C and 40 °C to viscous colourless oil whereupon it was dissolved in 2 ml of acetone at the same temperature. The solution was cooled to a temperature between 10 °C and 15°C at which temperature the mixture started to crystallize. The crystalline material was filtered, washed with cooled acetone and dried in a vacuum oven at 35 °C overnight. A second crop was isolated from the mother liquid followed by cooling, filtering and drying as described above.
