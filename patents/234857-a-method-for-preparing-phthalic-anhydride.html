STATEMENT REGARDING FEDERALLY SPONSORED RESEARCH &amp;<br>
DEVELOPMENT<br>
Not Applicable<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a preparation of anhydrides. More particularly, it relates to a<br>
transimidation-based method for the preparation of anhydrides.<br>
Polyetberimides are high heat engineering plastics having a variety of uses. As<br>
disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 5,229,482, one route for the synthesis of polyetherimides<br>
proceeds through a bis(4-chlorophthalimide) having the following structure (I)<br>
(I)<br>
wherein X is a divalent, alkylene, cycloalkylene, or arylene moiety. The bis(4-<br>
chlorophthalimide) wherein X is a 1 ,3-phenyl group (II) is particularly useful.<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
Bis(chlorophthalimide)s (1) and (II) are typically formed by the condensation of<br>
amines, e.g., 1 ,3-diaminobenzene with anhydrides, e.g., 4-chlorophthalic anhydride<br>
4-Chlorophthalic anhydride is an expensive starting material which presently must be<br>
custom synthesized. Current routes for the synthesis of 4-chlorophthalic anhydride<br>
lead to mixtures of isomers, which are difficult to separate, or are prohibitively costly.<br>
For example, the Diels-Alder condensation of maleic anhydride with 2-chloro-l,3-<br>
butadiene to yield 4-chlorotetrahydrophthalic anhydride, followed by aromatization in<br>
the presence bromine requires the subsequent recovery of HBr. Attempted thermal<br>
aromatization of 4-chloro-tetrahydrophthalic anhydride results in low yields of 4-<br>
chlorophthalic anhydride and tar formation. This and other routes are described in<br>
U.S. Patent Nos 5,059,697; 5,003,088; 5,322,954; 4,978,760 and 5,233,054.<br>
BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
A new method for the synthesis of phthalic anhydrides (IV)<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
wherein R' is a halogen, an aromatic or aliphatic group comprising 1 to about 18<br>
carbons, a hydrogen or a nitro group is the transimidation between the corresponding<br>
N-alkyl phthalimide (V)<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
wherein R1 in (IV) and R1 in (V) are identical, and further wherein R is an alkyl group<br>
having from 1 to about 18 carbons, and a tetrahydrophthalic anhydride (VI)<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
The by-product of the transimidation is an N-alkyl tetrahydrophthalimide (VII)<br>
In an advantageous feature of this method, where R1 in (V), (VI) and (VII) are<br>
identical, N-alkyl tetrahydrophthalimide (VII) may be converted by aromatization to<br>
produce the corresponding N-alkyl phthalimidc (V).<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
A convenient route for the formation of phthalic anhydrides (IV) is via transimidation<br>
between the corresponding N-alkyl phthalimide (V) and a tetrahydrophthalic<br>
anhydride (VI), A by-product of this reaction is an N-alkyl tetrahydrophthalimide<br>
(VII). This by-product is preferably converted to yield the corresponding N-alkyl<br>
phthalimide (V).<br>
The product phthalic anhydrides (IV) have the structure<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
wherein R1 is a halogen, an aromatic or aliphatic group comprising 1 to about 18<br>
carbons, a hydrogen or a nitro group.<br>
The starting N-alkyl phthalimides (V) have the structure<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
wherein R' is as described above, and R is a straight chain or branched alkyl group<br>
having from 1 to aboul 18 carbons, for example methyl, ethyl, propyl, and the like.<br>
N-alkyl phthalimides (V) may be obtained from the corresponding N-alkyl<br>
tetrahydrophthalimide by aromatization. Aromatization may be achieved by any<br>
method known in the art, such as those taught by U.S. Patent Nos. 5,233,054;<br>
5,003,088; 5,059,697 and 4,978,760. Aromatization may also be achieved by passing<br>
the N-alkyl tetrahydrophthalimide over a transition metal catalyst such as V2O5 at a<br>
temperature in the range of about 250°C to about 270°C. Alternately, N-alkyl<br>
phthalimides (V) may be obtained by heating a tetrahydrophthalic anhydride with the<br>
desired alkyl amine or aryl amine at a temperature of about 50°C to about 250°C for<br>
up to about 5 hours. The resulting product, N-alkyl phthalimide may be isolated by<br>
any method known in the art such as distillation or column chromatography.<br>
Tetrahydrophthalic anhydrides (VI)<br>
wherein R' is as defined above may be obtained by the Diels-Alder condensation of<br>
dienophile maleic anhydride with a diene substituted by R'. Conditions for this<br>
reaction are known in the chemical literature. Suitable R' substitutions include, but<br>
are not limited to, halogen, aromatic or aliphatic groups comprising I to about 18<br>
carbons, hydrogen or nitro group. A preferred diene is 2-chloro-l,3- butadiene<br>
(chloroprene).<br>
An advantageous feature of this method is that where R' are identical in both (V) and<br>
(VI), the by-product of the transimidation, N-alkyl tetrahydrophthalimide (VII)<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
can be converted by aromatization to produce N-alkyl phthalimide (V) as discussed<br>
above. Due to this advantageous feature it is contemplated that the synthesis of 4-<br>
chlorophthalic anhydrides may be practiced in a batchwise or continuous fashion.<br>
As shown in Scheme ] this method is particularly suitable for the formation of 4-<br>
chlorophthalic anhydride (III), which is an important intermediate in the synthesis of<br>
polyetherimides.<br>
Polyetherimides<br>
Scheme I<br>
Aromatization<br>
Accordingly, 4-chlorophthalic anhydride (III) is produced by transimidation of Nmethyl-<br>
4-chlorophthaIimide (VIII) with 4-chlorotetrahydrophthalic anhydride<br>
(IX). The by-product of the transimidation, N-methyl-4-<br>
chlorotetrahydrophthalimide (X) is preferably converted by aromatization to Nmethyl-<br>
4-chlorophthalimide(VIII).<br>
All patents cited herein are incorporated by reference.<br>
The invention is further described by the following non-limiting examples:<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
Example 1. Synthesis of N-methyl-4-chlorophthalimide (VIII).<br>
An appropriately equipped glass reaction vessel was charged with J86.5 grams (1<br>
mole) of 4-chlorotetrahydrophthalic anhydride and heated to 150°C under<br>
nitrogen. Methylamine gas (32 grams, 1.03 mole) was then introduced to the<br>
reaction vessel subsurface over 30 minutes. The reaction mixture was then heated<br>
for 3 hours at 180°C. The product was then distilled to give N-methyl-4-<br>
chlorophthalimide in approximately 95% yield.<br>
Example 2. Synthesis of 4-Chlorotetrahydrophthalic Anhydride (IX).<br>
] 56.9 g (1.6 mole) of maleic anhydride and 250 ml toluene were added to a flask.<br>
25 ml of toluene was removed by distillation to dry the solution. 150 g (1.69<br>
mole) of chloroprene dissolved in 250 ml of xylene was slowly added to the flask.<br>
The entire addition took 30 minutes. The resulting solution was then heated at<br>
55°C for three hours. The solution was then distilled to remove solvents. The<br>
remaining material was distilled at 160-165 °C (1 to 2 mm pressure) to afford 4-<br>
chlorotetrahydrophthalic anhydride in 85% yield (253 grams).<br>
Example 3. Synthesis of 4-Chlorophthalic Anhydride (III)<br>
A resealable 50-ml stainless steel tube was charged with 1.5 g 4-<br>
chlorotetrahydrophthalic anhydride, 0.262 g N-methyl-4-chlorophthalimide, 0.841<br>
g triethylamine, and 20 ml of water. The tube was sealed and heated in an oil bath<br>
at 170 °C for 3 hours, and then cooled to room temperature.<br>
A small sample of the aqueous phase was analyzed by GCMS. The analysis<br>
showed that 83.2% exchange had occurred. Analysis further showed that the<br>
reaction mixture was composed of 2.4 mol% of N-methyl-4-chlorophthalimide,<br>
11.9 mol% of N-methyl-4-chloro tetrahydrophthalimide, 11.9 mol% of 4-<br>
chlorophthalic anhydride (as the triethylamine salt of the corresponding diacid),<br>
and 73.8 mol% of 4-chlorotetrahydrophthalic anhydride (as the triethylamine salt<br>
of the corresponding diacid).<br>
The aqueous phase was extracted with 20 ml of toluene containing 3 wt%<br>
triethylamine in a separately funnel at room temperature. The toluene extraction<br>
effectively removed the N-methyl-4-chlorotetrahydrophthalimide and the<br>
unreacted N-methyl-4-chlorophthalimide from the aqueous phase. The aqueous<br>
phase still contained the 4-chlorophthalic anhydride (as the triethylamine salt of<br>
the corresponding diacid), and the 4-ch)orotetrahydrophthalic anhydride (as the<br>
tnethylamine salt of the corresponding diacid). The aqueous phase was distilled,<br>
during which the triethylamine salts cracked to liberate water and triethylamine,<br>
with the formation of 4-chlorophthalic anhydride and 4-chlorotetrahydrophthalic<br>
anhydride. The water and triethylamine were taken overhead, and the still<br>
bottoms were collected. The still bottoms were then distilled to separate the 4-<br>
chlorotetrahydrophthalic anhydride from the 4-chlorophthalic anhydride A. The<br>
4-chlorotetrahydrophthalic anhydride was recombined with the water and TEA<br>
previously collected, and reused.<br>
Example 4. Conversion of N-methyl-4-chlorotetrahydrophthalirnide (X) to Nmethyl-<br>
4-chlorophthalimide.<br>
Gas phase reactions were carried out in a hot-tube reactor that was packed with<br>
about 13 grams of a catalyst containing VjOs. The inlet of the hot-tube reactor<br>
was connected to a flow controller and heated syringe pump. The flow controller<br>
managed the flow of purified air. The heated syringe pump contained 4-chloro-Nmethyl<br>
tetrahydrophthalimide and delivered it to the hot tube reactor at a constant<br>
rate of 0.05 milliliters per minute. The outlet of the hot tube reactor was<br>
connected to a receiver cooled in an ice-bath where the reaction products were<br>
collected. The hot-tube reactor was maintained at the 260°C. The reaction<br>
product was analyzed by gas chromatographic techniques after the system had<br>
equilibrated for 10-20 minutes. At a flow rate of 90ml/min all of the N-methyl-4-<br>
chlorotetrahydrophthalimide was converted to N-methyl-4-chlorophthalimide.<br>
While preferred embodiments have been shown and described, various<br>
modifications and substitutions may be made thereto without departing from the<br>
spirit and scope of the invention. Accordingly, it is to be understood that the<br>
present invention has been described by way of illustration and not limitation.<br><br><br><br>
