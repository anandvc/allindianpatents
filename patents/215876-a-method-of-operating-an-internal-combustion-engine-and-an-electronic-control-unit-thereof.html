				<td>The present invention relates to a method of operating an internal combustion engine and an electronic control unit (ECU) for an internal combustion engine.<br>
This invention relates to fuel injection systems of the two fluid type for internal combustion engines. In such engines, metered quantities of fuel are delivered to a combustion chamber of the engine entrained n a gas, typically air, supplied from a pressurised gas source, typically a gas duct of a rail. '<br>
Such fuel injection systems, whilst not limited to, are particularly applicable to engines for use in automotive and outboard marine and recreational applications. In such engines, commercial and us;er considerations require that the engine start-up period be relatively short under a wide range of conditions. For example, an engine may be employed for operation under ambient and extreme ambient conditions and efficient engine operation is important no matter the conditions. An important part of achieving a rapid startÂ¬up period in such engines is the ready availability of compressed gas at an adequate pressure to assure effective fuel delivery as close to start-up as possible. However, for cost and other considerations, it is not convenient to provide a relatively large compressed air storage capacity, and in any event, there is also the risk of loss of pressure due to leakage, panicularly when the engine has been inoperative for a certain period.<br>
Typically, a compressor driven by the engine is provided as the means for supplying compressed gas to an engine having a fuel injection system of the type above described. For both reasons of economy and energy efficiency, it is customary to select the compressor capacity to closely match the air consumption rate of the engine. Thus, under start-up conditions, there is typically no reserve supply of air at the appropriate pressure for fuel delivery and the compressor, and thus the engine, must complete a number of cycles before air at the required pressure is available to assist in the injection of fuel.<br>
The above factors each contribute to lengthening of tho period between commencement of the start-up sequence of the engine and the availability of air at the required pressure to assist in the injection of fuel.<br>
It is known from US Patent No. 4936279 assigned to the Applicant to provide a fuel injection system wherein fuel is injected thrcugh a selectively operable injector nozzle directly into the combustion chambe- of the engine by way of gas from a pressurised gas system. However, when the engine is in start-up mode, gases delivered from an engine combust on chamber are allowed to pass through the injector nozzle into the gas suppl/ system to assist in a more rapid pressurisation thereof.<br>
However, as will be seen from Figure 1 which relates to the prior art, the opening of the injector nozzle over several consecutive cycles without any control may lead to a cycling of pressure in the gas suppy system. More specifically, the pressure in the rail of the gas supply system will cycle in accordance with the pressure present in the various combustion chambers of a multi-cylinder engine, each equipped with an injector nozzle which is opened at a set timing before top dead centre and closed at a different sot timing before or after top dead centre. Thus, although pressurisation of the rail is achieved, there are phases of depressurisation thereof corresponding to periods when the injector nozzle of a cylinder is opened whilst the cylinder pressure is less than that to which the rail or other gas system has been charged during a previous charging or "pump-up" event. These periods of depressurisation cost time in terms of establishing the required pressure in the gas system as time Is lost in recharging the rail to the value at which the previous charging <jvent had taken it before any incremental rise in rail pressure can be achieved.></jvent>
It is therefore the object of the present invention to provide further reductions in the period required to bring the gas supply system of a dual fluid fuel injection system up to a pressure which will enable satisfactory fuel injection thereby.<br>
With this object in view, there is provided a method of operating an internal combustion engine having a fuel injection system including at least one injector for delivery of fuel entrained in gas the gas being supplied from a gas supply system to at least one combustion chamber of the ergine wherein, as part of a pump-up sequence in which the gas supply system s pressurised on start-up to a desired pressure to enable injection of fuel to the engine, the at<br>
least one injector is opened allowing gas to flow from :he at least one combustion chamber through the open injector and into the gas supply system when the pressure in said at least one combustion chambe,- of the engine is substantially the same as or higher than the pressure in the gas supply system to pressurise same for subsequent entrapment and delivery of fuel to the engine. Typically, the gas supply system will be pressurised for subsequent delivery of fuel directly into at least one combustion chamber o' the engine.<br>
More particularly, the at least one injector is opened whon the pressure in the at least one combustion chamber is substantially the same as or higher than the pressure in the gas supply system upon engine stari-up and after a preceding pump-up event in the pump-up sequence. It should be noted that in certain circumstances, opening the injector to enable a reverse flow of gas therethrough from the combustion chamber to the gas supply system may include maintaining the injector open following a previous gas and/or fuel delivery event thereby.<br>
A pump-up sequence is made up of at least one event n which a nozzle of the injector is held open allowing pressurised gas tc pass from the combustion chamber to the gas supply system during start-up of the engine. Such an event is a "pump-up* event. As will be expanced upon further hereinafter, in a multi-cylinder engine, a sequence of pump-uD events may be made up of a number of separate pump-up events sequentially effected in different cylinders of the engine. Alternatively, the pump-up events may be restricted to only one or a number of the total number of cylinders in the multi-cylinder engine.<br>
Preferably, during a sequence of pump-up events the injector nozzle is opened and closed at successively closer timings to the lop dead centre position of a piston reciprocating in the combustion chamber of the engine as the number of engine cycles since start-up is incremented. That is, the method involves opening the injector nozzle and holding it open over an angle of engine revolution commencing at a certain angle before top dead centre and ending at a certain different angle before or after top dead centro.<br>
Preferably, the periods of opening of the injector nozzle end at a certain<br>
angle after top dead centre.   Preferably, the period of open.ng of the injector nozzle is successively reduced during a sequence of pump-up events.<br>
In a single cylinder engine, the angle at which the injector nozzle is opened is progressively reduced with consecutive cycles QI: the engine. As alluded to hereinbefore, in a multi-cylinder engine having a preset firing order, each cylinder in the firing sequence may have its injector noz::le opened over a lesser angle than that in a preceding cylinder in the pump-up sequence. In this manner, gas at successively higher pressure is introduced to the gas supply system of the engine which, for example, may be an air duct of an engine rail unit. Moreover, this can be done with economy in terms of the number of cycles of engine operation required to bring the gas supply system up to the requisite pressure. In particular, the phenomenon is avoided whereby a depressurisation phase takes place for each pump-up event prior to charging of the rail to a successively higher pressure due to opening the injector nozzle too early or closing it too late in a successive engine cylinder cycle. Hence, the timings of the pump-up events are optimised so that any loss of pressure from the gas supply system is a minimum or is avoided altogether.<br>
Conveniently, once the gas supply system has been charged up to a level where gas assisted fuel injection can occur and the engine has commenced firing, the injector nozzle may be held open for a certain period after a metered quantity of fuel has been delivered by the injector to continue pressurising the gas supply system during the start-up period of the engine and prior to the main source of compressed gas being able to adeqjately pressurise the gas supply system. Preferably, the injector nozzle may bo held open until after ignition as occurred in the at least one combustion chamber, in this regard, following ignition, peak pressure in the combustion chamber r ses rapidly as a consequence of combustion phenomena causing a consequential rise in the pressure of the gas supply system, and, more particularly, <m air rail of the engine. it is advantageous to make use this in pressure charge until main source compressed gas can adequately prsssurise rail. itself comprises a further aspect invention.></m>
Conveniently, where the gas supply system takes the form of a rail, the<br>
rail will be communicated through suitable ducting to the wor<ing chamber of a gas compressor and as typically the is air most interest an compressor. rail may be up to desired pressure achieve degree fuel atomisation say kpa though this will vary with ambient or other conditions in accordance method above described. however enhance process one way valve placed at convenient location between ducting communicating avoid pressurisation aid working during start-up period. suci manner pumped required more rapidly. that proportion pump-up sequence not expended pumping before satisfactory injection can take place. certain circumstances volume third rail.></ing>
Preferably, the one way valve Is located at the point that the ducting intersects the rail to minimise that volume which is to be pjmped-up during engine start-up.<br>
Further, the one way valve may also serve to prevent or reduce leak down of pressure from the gas supply system following cessation of engine operation. In this manner, a subsequent pump-up sequence may not need to comprise as many pump-up events as in the case where the gas supply system contains substantially no gas pressure. Accordingly, some reduction in the length of the pump-up sequence may be possible.<br>
Conveniently, the engine temperature at a start-up may be input to the electronic control system of the engine to further optimise the necessary pump-up sequence. For example, it is known that at lower temperatures a greater degree of fuel atomisation is necessary to achieve stable eigine operation. Accordingly, this may require a higher gas pressure for deli/ery of fuel and hence the gas supply system will need to be pumped-up to this higher level before satisfactory fuel injection can take place. The opposite may be true for higher temperatures at which a satisfactory degree of vaporisation is believed to occur in the combustion chamber due to the higher temperature therein. Hence,<br>
for different engine temperatures, it is convenient that the gas supply system be pumped-up to different pressure levefs before efficient fuel injection can commence. Accordingly, the pump-up sequence may be made dependent on engine temperature. This additional parameter upon which a subsequent pump-up sequence is determined may be used on the assumption that at startÂ¬up of the engine, no or minimal pressure exists in the gas supply system. Alternatively, as further described below, an estimation of ihe residual pressure in the gas supply system may be made based on a known or representative leak-down rate of the gas supply system of the engine.<br>
In this latter regard, typically following cessation of engine operation, any residual gas in the gas supply system will typically leak to atmosphere. This might occur via, for example, the air compressor of the dual fluid injection system. Accordingly, if this leak down rate is profiled against time, an estimate of the remaining gas pressure In the gas supply system may be made by an electronic control system of the engine and used to mbc'lfy the pump-up sequence on start-up. That is, a lesser number of pump-up evonts, for example, may be used to achieve satisfactory pressurisation of the gas supply system,<br>
In a further embodiment, the leak down rate may be profiled against engine temperature allowing estimation of the residual gas pressure on the basis of a known engine temperature on start-up.<br>
The present invention relates to a method of operating an internal combustion engine having a fuel injection system comprising at least one injector means to deliver fuel entrained in a gas directly to a combustion chamber of the engine, and a gas supply system in communication with the injector means to provide gas thereto, said method including rendering the injector means of at least one combustion chamber open over at least first and second engine cylinder cycles during engine startÂ¬up to thereby deliver compressed gas from said combustion chamber through the injector means to the gas supply system wherein said rendering of said injector means open over said second engine cylinder cycle is timed to occur later in said second engine cylinder cycle than in said first engine cylinder cycle whereby the pressure in said at least one combustion chamber of the engine is the same as or higher than the pressure in the gas supply system.<br>
The present invention also relates to an electronic control unit (ECU) for an internal combustion engine having a fuel injection system including at least one injector means to deliver fuel entrained in a gas directly to a combustion chamber of the engine, and a gas supply system in communication with the injector means to provide gas thereto, said ECU adapted to control said internal combustion engine according to a method including rendering the injector means of at least one combustion chamber open over at least first and second engine cylinder cycles during engine start-up to thereby deliver compressed gas from said combustion chamber through the injector means to the gas supply system wherein said rendering of said injector means open over said second engine cylinder cycle is timed to occur later in said second engine cylinder cycle than in said first engine cylinder cycle whereby the pressure in said at least one combustion chamber of the engine is the same as or higher than the pressure in the gas supply system.<br>

The overall operation of an engine operated in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention will now be described with reference to Figure 2, which shows a multi-cylinder engine 20 having an ;air intake system 22, an ignition means 24, a fuel pump 23, and a fuel reservoir 28. The engine further includes an electric starter motor 25 energised by a battery 70 upon operation of a starter switch 71. An air compressor 29 is driven by a belt 32 from an engine crankshaft pulley 33o.. Mounted in the cylinder head 40 of the engine 20 is a fuel and air rail unit 11.<br>
Referring now to Figure 3, there is shown in detail the fusl and air rail unit<br>
11	comprising a fuel metering unit 10 and an air injector or a Fuel injection unit<br>
12	for each cylinder of the multi-cylinder engine 20, which in the present<br>
embodiment is a three cylinder two-stroke engine.   However, the invention is<br>
equally applicable to single cylinder configurations dnd multi-cylinder engines<br>
of any number of cylinders of either the two or tour stroke type whether<br>
reciprocating piston engine or other forms of engines including rotary engine.<br>
The body 8 of the fuel and air rail unit 11 is an extruded component with a<br>
longitudinally extending air duct 13 and a fuel supply duct 14.<br>
At appropriate locations, as shown in Figure 4, there are provided connectors and suitable ducts communicating the rail unit 11 with air and fuel supplies: duct 49 communicating air duct 13 with the air compressor 29; duct 53 providing an air outlet which returns air to the air intake system 22; duct 52 communicating the fuel reservoir 28 and fuel supply duct 14; and duct 51 providing a fuel return passage and communicating fuel supply duct 14 with fuel reservoir 28. The air duct 13 communicates with a suitable air regulator 27 and the duct 51 communicates with the fuel reservoir 28 via a suitable fuel regulator 26.<br>
The fuel metering unit 10 is commercially available and requires no detailed description herein. Suitable ports are provided to allow fuel to flow<br>
through the rail unit 11 and a metering nozzle 21 is provided to deliver fuel to passage 120 and thence to fuel and air injector 12.<br>
The injector 12 has a housing 30 with a cylindrical spigot 31 projecting from a lower end thereof, the spigot 31 defining an injection port 32 communicating with the passage 120. The injection port 32 includes a solenoid operated selectively openable poppet valve 34 operating in a manner similar to that as described in the Applicant's US Patent No 493432 9, -tfre ee<br>
- â¢befetey incorporated -by feforonoe. As seen in Fig 2, energisation of the solenoid in accordance with commands from an electronic control unit (ECU) 100 opens the valve 34 to deliver a fuel-gas mixtures to a combustion chamber 60 of the engine 20 and, in accordance with the control strategy of the present invention, admits pressurised gases from the combustion chamber 60 through the air injector 12 and ultimately into the air duct 13, to pressurise it on start-up as described in further detail herelnbelow. However, it is not intended to limit the valve construction to that as described above and other valves, for example, pintle valve constructions, could be employed.<br>
Returning to Figure 2, the electronic control unit (ECU) 100 receives signals from a crankshaft speed and position sensor 44, of suitable type known in the an, via the lead 45 and from an air flow sensor 46 located in the air intake system 22 via the lead 47. The ECU 100, which may also receive signals indicative of other engine operating conditions such as the engine temperature and ambient temperature (not shown), determines, from all input signals received the quantity of fuel required to be delivered to each of the cylinders of the engine 20. Engine temperature sensing is important in an embodiment of the invention described below where sensing of engine and/or ambient temperature may be employed in determination of the required pump-up sequence. This general type of ECU is well known in the art of electronically controlled fuel injection systems and will not be described here n further detail.<br>
Opening of each injector valve 34 is controlled by the ECU 100 via a respective lead 101 in timed relation to the engine cycle to effect delivery of fuel from the injection port 32 to a combustion chamber 60 of the engine 20. By virtue of the two fluid nature of the system, fuel is delivered to the cylinder<br>
entrained in a gas. In this regard, it is important that the pressure of the gas, particularly air, employed to entrain the fuel and deliver it in the form of an atomised dispersion, is sufficiently high to create the desired degree of atomisation.<br>
The passage 120 is in constant communication with the air duct 13 via the conduit 80 as shown in Figure 3 and thus, under nornal operation, is maintained at a substantially steady air pressure. Upon energising of the solenoid, the valve 34 is displaced downwardly to open the injection port 32 so that a metered quantity of fuel is carried by air through the injection port 32 into the combustion chamber 60 of a cylinder of the engine 20.<br>
Typically, the air injector 12 is located within the cylindsr head 40 of the engine, and is directly in communication with the combustion chamber 60 defined by the reciprocation of a piston 61 within the engine cylinder. As above described, when the injection port 32 is opened and the air supply available via the conduit 80 is above the pressure in the engine cylinder, air will flow from the air duct 13 through the passage 80, passage 120 and, entrained with fuel, injection port 32, into the engine combustion chamber 60. However, if the air supply in the air duct 13 of the rail unit 11 is not at a sufficiently high pressure it cannot effectively carry the fuel through the injection port 32 into the combustion chamber 60. In particular, insufficient pressure to effect the dslivery of fuel-air mixtures to the combustion chamber 60 typically exist at start-up of the engine, particularly where there has been sufficient time since previous operation of the engine to enable leakage from the pressurised air supply systen or rail unit 11.<br>
In accordance with the present method, a signal is provided to the ECU 100 from the starter switch 71, via a lead 102, when the starter switch 71 is operated to energise the starter motor 25. The ECU 100 is programmed so that, upon receipt of this signal, the ECU 100 will not instruct the fuel metering unit 10 to deliver fuel to the injector 12, but, having determined the position of the crankshaft 33 via the position sensor 44 will energise the solenoid of injector 12 to open the injection port 32. The opening of the injection port 32 is timed in<br>
relation to the cycle of the cylinder of the engine 20, as sensed by the crankshaft<br><br>
, position sensor 44 and passed to the ECU 100 by the lead 45, so that the<br>
injection port 32 will be opened at a pre-determined point in the compression stroke of the particular cylinder of the engine 20.<br>
Thus with the injection port 32 open and the engine 20 being cranked as part of the engine start-up sequence, the pressure in the cylinder will rise to a level sufficient to cause air to flow from the engine combustion chamber 60 through the open injection port 32 into the passage 80 and into the air duct 13. Having regard to the displacement volume of the engine cyl nder, compared with the volume of the air duct 13, and of the air space in each of the injectors 12 coupled thereto, the air pressure in the air duct 13 can be brought up to a satisfactory operating pressure in a minimal number of engine cylinder cycles.<br>
However, it is desired to avoid a situation where ihe air duct 13 depressurises as a consequence of a delivery of air from a respective engine cylinder to the air duct 13 being initiated and terminated at the same timings for each successive cylinder cycle of the multi-cylinder engine. When this occurs there is an initial inflow of air to the air duct 13 and then a certain degree of outflow during each successive cylinder cycle of the engine, Hence, some pressure accumulated in the previous cylinder cycle is lost upon opening of injection port 32 as the pressure in the air duct 13 is higher ths.n in combustion chamber 60 for an initial portion of the compression stroke. Thereafter, the pumping work done by piston 61 serves to further pump-up the air duct 13. Accordingly, the pressure in the air duct 13 may cycle as shown in Figure 1 over a number of cylinder cycles from start-up until a satisfactory pressure is achieved therein. Thus, a greater number of cylinder cycles are required to bring the pressure in the air duct 13 to the required operating level. Consequently, the time interval required from initiation of start-jp to attainment of the required pressure level in the air duct 13 is prolonged and hence the effective time required for starting of the engine 20 is also prolonged.<br>
Therefore, rather than the ECU 100 setting the same injection port opening and closing times for each successive pump-up event, the injection port 32 is opened an incremented period later than in the previous cycle and closed at a correspondingly earlier time than in the previous cycle sc that advantage may be taken of the successively higher pressures in the latÂ«r portion of the<br>
compression stroke and the earlier portion of the expansion stroke, The ECU 100 may increment the opening time and decrement the dosing time of injection port in a stepwise or any desired algorithmic manner to eisure opening and closing of the injection port closer to the top dead centre: position for each successive purnp-up event.<br>
In this manner, the drop in pressure in the air duct 13 tetween successive cylinder cycles may be reduced and an appropriately determined increase in the pressure may be achieved in the air duct 13 with little or no drop in pressure therein between the successive pump-up events. In this regard, the benefit may be seen from Figure 6 which shows a much smaller degree of fluctuation in pressure than shown in Figure 1. Further, with the selection of appropriate opening and closing times for the injection port 32, the pressure in the air duct 13 may be made to successively increase with no pressure loss over successive pump-up events.<br>
In the case of a multi-cylinder engine, there are "n" combustion chambers 60 and "n" air injectors 12. The timings of opening of each air injection port 32 will be set so as to avoid the depressurisation phenomenon discussed above. Put another way, the period or crank angle between the start of air (SOA) event and the end of air (EGA) event of the injectors 12 is reduced over successive cylinder cycles of the engine as shown for a three cylinder engine in Figure 5. In this case, the air duct 13 of the rail unit 11 is pumped up to a desired pressure level in a shorter time. The ECU 100 may readily be configured to calculate suitable SOA and EOA timings for each cycle of the engine optionally in accordance with sensed rail pressure.<br>
Further, the pump-up sequence is preferably arranged ID be in the same order as the firing sequence, which for an n cylinder engine may be 1,2...n. Thus, at start-up, after a maximum of 360Â° of rotation for the engine to determine the position of the crankshaft 33, the injection port 32 of cylinde' 1 , for example, will have certain SOA and EOA timings determined therefor, then the SOA and EOA timings for the air injection port 32 of cylinder 2 will be set .somewhat closer together (closer to top dead centre (TDC) that is SOA is retarded and EOA advanced) such as to provide a higher delivery pressure than that provided by<br>
cylinder 1, then the SOA and EOA timings for the injection port 32 of cylinder 3 will likewise be closer together to provide an even higher pressure and so on up to n cylinders of the engine. Should pump-up still be required when the engine firing sequence returns to cylinder 1, the SOA and EOA timings will be incrementally higher and lower respectively than cylinder n of the previous firing cycle.<br>
SOA and EOA timings may be set in the time or cranK angle domain but, in any event, may be set having regard to factors such as; engine operating temperature and/or sensed pressure in the air duct 13. SOA and EOA for the air injectors 12 will generally occur before and after the top dead centre (TDC) position of the piston 61 reciprocating in the cylinder respectively.<br>
In a further variant, it is possible to continue pumping-up the air duct 13 even after fuel has commenced being delivered to the engine 20 for combustion. In particular it is possible for the injection port 32 to be held open following delivery of fuel to ensure that ignition occurs whilst the injection port 32 is still open. This provides a means of further charging the air duct 13 as pressure in the combustion chamber 60 will increase rapidly following onset of ignition and hence an equally rapid increase of the pressure of the air duct 13 is possible. However, it is desirable that the injection port 32 not be held open for a period longer than is necessary to quickly attain the pressure of at least 550 kPa in the air duct 13. If the injection port is held open longer than necessary, there is diminishing benefit, insofar as combustion gases wi! be able to enter the air duct 13 and this may cause problems in terms of carbon build up in the fuel injection system. In a preferred embodiment, the EOA takes place within 10Â° of the ignition event to prevent or reduce such an occurrence. Further, it is preferred that such subsequent pump-up events are only performed until the compressor 29 is able to supply air at the appropriate pressure to the air duct 13. This, for example, would occur after about 8-14 engine cylinder cycles.<br>
It will be appreciated from the above discussion made with reference to Figure 2 that the air supply system constitutes a relatively large volume. The volume is made up of the air duct 13, the working chamber of the air compressor 29, the duct 49 communicating the working chamber of the air compressor 29<br>
with the air duct 13 of the rail unit 11 and, optionally, an additional chamber provided between the compressor 29 and the air duct 13 of the rail unit 11 to provide capacity to absorb pressure pulses arising from the cyclic nature of operation of the reciprocating compressor 29. As it is intended to reduce the time required to pressurise the air duct 13 to the minimurr possible, it is convenient to provide a one-way valve 50 as shown in Figure 2 between the air duct 13 and the duct 49 communicating the air duct 13 with the working chamber of the compressor 29.<br>
Conveniently, the one-way valve 50 is incorporated into the rail unit 11 and is located at the very end of the air duct 13 at the point at v/hich it joins the duct 49. Hence, during start-up whilst the compressor 29 is unable to provide air at the appropriate pressure to the air duct 13, the one-way valve 50 serves to isolate the air duct 13 from the compressor 29 and the duct 49. This may reduce the volume that is required to be pumped up at start-up by up to one third in some instances. Hence only the air duct 13 of the rail unit 11 and not the remaining portion of the air supply system is required to be pressurised at startÂ¬up. In this way, the volume required to be pressurised is minimised and the air duct 13 more rapidly reaches the operating pressure of, for example, approximately 550 kPa which is required for appropriate fuel injaction at 20-25Â° C.<br>
This reduction of the air supply system volume is only nacessary during the cranking regime whilst the compressor 29 is not doing any significant work. Once the air compressor 29 is generating a higher pressure than can be achieved using the method as above described, the one-way valve 50 will be biased into an open position by the pressure delivered by the compressor 29 overcoming a spring or like means associated therewith allowing air to flow continuously into the air duct 13 from the working chamber of the compressor 29. The valve 50 may be of any desired type but is ideally to be simple in construction. However, there is no reason why this valve oould not be a solenoid actuated valve with appropriate timing set by the E-CU 100. The provision of such a one way valve 50 reduces overall cranking time to the extent that the first fuel injection event may take place one third to one half revolution of<br>
the engine earlier and this is commercially advantageous.<br>
The provision of compensation for engine temperature' may be provided for in accordance with the present invention. For example', the required air pressure for satisfactory operation of the engine 20 varies with temperature such that the higher the engine temperature the lower the pressure required for appropriate operation of the engine 20. Without wishing to be bound'by any theory, it appears that at low engine temperatures, the cylinder walls are cold and provide a heat sink for fuel thus preventing the formation of the desired atomised fuel-air dispersion within the cylinder for efficient combustion. Conversely, when the engine temperature is sufficiently high, it is evident that a lower air pressure is sufficient to achieve satisfactory atomisatlon of the fuel and air. Therefore, it may be appropriate to have the pump-up stra:egy controlled by the ECU 100 in relation to some measure of engine temperature. For example, the engine coolant temperature may be used as a measure of engine temperature for this purpose. If a higher air pressure is required at start-up, due to the engine 20 being at an initially low temperature, extra punp-up events can be scheduled during the start-up period of the engine 20. In this way, the required schedule of pump-up events is achieved for any operating temperature encountered by the engine 20. Where the pump-up sequence is dependent on engine temperature, it is preferably implemented on the basis that no or minimal pressure exists in the air duct 13. Alternatively, an assumption may be made that a certain air pressure remains in air duct 13 as described below.<br>
When the engine 20 is shut down, it is possible that presence from within the air duct 13 may leak down at a certain rate. This leak down rate may, for example, be dependent upon the construction of the compressor 29 used on the engine 20. Accordingly, if this leak down rate is known and the time for which the engine has been inoperative is known, an estimate of pressure of the air remaining in air duct 13 may be made by ECU 100. This information may be used to modify the pump-up sequence as appropriate during the next start-up event. Taking this concept a step further, the leak down rate may be related to the engine cooling rate. Therefore, by sensing the engine temperature at startÂ¬up, a certain leak down rate of air duct 13 may be assumed and used to modify<br><br>
the pump-up sequence required. For example, if a certain level of pressure is known to remain in the air duct 13, then a reduced pump-up sequence and hence a shorter time to pressurise the air duct 13 may be achieved.<br>
Although the provision of the one way valve 50 is palicularly applicable to assist in reducing the overall pump-up time for the air duct 13, it is possible for the one way valve 50 to be used in a manner that permits a 'Limp Home' mode in the case where the compressor 29 of the engine 20 fails.<br>
If the compressor 29 fails, the one way valve 50 will typically close due to the action of the biasing means associated therewith. A pressure sensor arranged, for example, in the ducting communicating the working chamber of the compressor 29 with the air duct 13 of the rail, may flag a value indicating compressor failure. When this is flagged, the ECU 100 may revert to a mode of operation in which at least one air injector 12 of the engine Â£0 is opened for a period of time after completion of the fuel delivery from the injection port 32 thereof to the combustion chamber 60, This will permit gas from the combustion chamber 60 to pass through the injection port 32 of the air injector 12 to raise the gas pressure in the air duct 13 to a sufficient value to effect fuel delivery during the next engine cylinder cycle. The injection port 32 may be held open for a period after and continuous with the injection of "he fuel into the combustion chamber 60 to allow gas to pass into the passage 80 and effect a required rise of gas pressure in the air duct 13.<br>
In a multi-cylinder engine, one cylinder may alternatively be used solely to provide pressurisation of the air duct 13 whilst the other cylinders may be operated to compensate for the engine running with one less cylinder. Alternatively, gas may be delivered from each cylinder of the engine by way of the method described in the previous paragraph.<br>
In some engines, for example, those operating on a V6 configuration, there may be two rail units 11, one for each bank of cylinders. If the compressor 29 fails, one rail unit 11 may be employed to act as a source of compressed air by using a method as above described. The other bank of cylinders would operate normally or in a manner to compensate for the modified mode of operation. In such a system, certain provisions would need to be made to<br>
enable the air duct 13 of the first rail unit 11 to provide pressurised air for use by the second rail unit 11. The closure of the one-way valve 50 in the first rail unit 11 will prevent leakage of air from the air duct 13 into the air .-supply system and thus enable engine operation even following compressor failure. This may constitute a still further aspect of the present invention.<br>
It may also be possible to construct a diagnostic mode whereby, if air duct 13 fails to reach the required pressure after a number of pimp-up events air compressor failure is indicated and such a "Limp Home" mode as previously described is activated.<br>
Whatever the variants of the present method employed, the start-up pump-up sequence above described may be terminated when, for example, a pressure sensor in the air duct 13 or duct 49 indicates that the pressure in the air duct 13 is sufficient to enable efficient operation of the engine 20. When this is flagged, the pump-up sequence may be terminated.<br>
Although the present invention is particularly applicable to automotive outboard marine and recreational engines, where short start times are extremely important, it may also be incorporated in dual fluid fuel injection systems for other types of engines. The invention is applicable to engines operating on either the two stroke cycle or the four stroke cycle.<br>
Upon reading of the above disclosure, the person of ordinary skill in the art may develop modifications for variations thereof. These modifications and variations fall within the scope of the present invention.<br><br><br>
