				<td>ABSTRACT OF THE DISCLOSURE<br>
Described is a process for producing a fragrance-containing polymeric fiber which optionally contains (i) at least one antimicrobial agent; and (ii) at least one compatible coloring material or color-forming material which is useful in the ascertainment of the exhaustion or substantial reduction of fragrance comprising the steps of:<br>
(a)	co-extruding fragrance and optionally (i) antimicrobial agent and/or (ii) at least one compatible coloring material or color-forming material which is useful for ascertainment of the exhaustion or substantial reduction of fragrance, with a thermoplastic polymer to form an extrudate;<br>
(b)	forming fragrance (and optionally (i) antimicrobial agent and/or (ii) at least one compatible coloring material or color-forming material which is useful for ascertainment of the exhaustion or substantial reduction of fragrance agent)-emitting particles from the extrudate; and<br>
(c)	extruding a fiber of from about 3 denier up to about 60 denier from the<br>
thus-formed particles.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Our invention is directed to a fragrance-emitting fiber useful in the creation of a controllably releasable or permanently fragrance-emitting dry or wet wipe laminar fabric article which optionally has efficacious antimicrobial properties. The article comprises a non-woven fabric lamina having woven therethrough and substantially throughout at least a finite portion of the laminar surface, such fragrance-imparting component-emitting fiber, which controllably and continuously releases fragrance and optionally (i) contains antimicrobial agent and/or (ii) at least one compatible coloring material or color-forming material which is useful for ascertainment of the exhaustion or substantial reduction of fragrance, at least for the time period of use of said dry or wet wipe laminar fabric article. Our invention is also directed to a process for the production of such fragrance-emitting fiber.<br>
Fragranced fiber materials are well known in the prior art. Thus, United States Letters Patent No. 3,567,118 issued on March 2, 1971 discloses composite fiber materials which are adapted for odorizdng, deodorizing, sanitizing and cleansing purposes by treating the fibrous material with a coating of a hydrophilic acrylate or methacryiate containing an appropriate essence, bactericide, cleansing agent or the like. It is indicated in said U.S. Letters Patent No. 3,567,118 mat both natural and synthetic fibers can be treated with a solution of the hydrophilic polymer, and that entrapment of the chemical agent can be prolonged by using a copolymer of the hydrophilic monomer with a minor amount of a hydrophobic monomer. U.S. Letters Patent No. 3,567,118 does not set forth the creation of a permanently, continuously fragrancing wet wipe or dry wipe. By the same token, U.S. Letters Patent No. 3,567,119 issued on March 2, 1971 discloses methods for the incorporating of fragrance compounds or oil bouquets and/or topical antifungal or antibacterial agents, insect repellent compounds and certain odoriferous medicaments into polymeric or natural materials so that the fabricated product possesses the properties imparted by the additive or additives for a long period of time. Further, in<br>
U.S. Letters Patent No. 3,567,119, it is indicated that the efficiency of incorporating additives such as fragrance materials into the articles of the invention is improved by the use of surfactants and the effectiveness and duration of the additive or additives in the fabricated product is enhanced by employing antioxidants and/or ultraviolet radiation absorbers.<br>
Additional perfumed fibers and antimicrobial product-containing fibers described by the prior art are as follows:<br>
Japan Published Application No. 63/135573 published on June 7, 1988 (perfumed fiber production by applying perfume emulsifier including spinning oil to fiber and heating in steam), assigned to Takasago Perfumery Company, Ltd.;<br>
Japan Published Application No. 111/17174 published on May 27, 1999 discloses an antimicrobial fiber made up of polyester resin having a surface layer containing an antimicrobial agent. The antimicrobial agent consists of a quaternary phosphonium salt group which bonds ionically with an acid component of a hydrophilic resin (assigned to Toyobo KK); and<br>
Japan Granted Patent No. 29/26446 published on July 28, 1999 entitled "Deodorizing Fibers, Manufacturing Method for the Fibers and Application Method for the Fibers" assigned to Suzuki Sogyo KK.<br>
Neither U.S. Letters Patent No. 3,567,118 nor U.S. Letters Patent No. 3,567,119 discloses the creation of fragrance-emitting fibers which can be used to form efficacious, continuous and permanent fragrance-emitting dry or wet wipe articles which have woven therethrough such fragrance-emitting fiber which is thermoplastic and substantially water-insoluble. Furthermore, none of the Japanese patent applications or granted patents<br>
disclose fibers which are fragrance-emitting and can be used to form fragrance-emitting dry or wet wipe articles which have woven therethrough such fragrance-emitting fibers.<br>
Furthermore, U.S. Letters Patent No. 4,713,291 issued on December 15, 1987 discloses fragrant fiber wherein a fragrant sheath-core composite fiber "suitable for bedding" and having a cross section including a sheath and a core including a hollow portion wherein an aromatic perfume having a boiling point higher than 150°C under normal pressure is incorporated and dispersed in an amount 0.1 to 10.0% by weight in a thermoplastic polymer constituting the core. The core component in U.S. Letters Patent No. 4,713,291 is preferably a polyethylene-type polymer, and the sheath component is preferably a polyethylene terephthalate polymer. One of me typical compositions of the aromatic perfume of U.S. Letters Patent No. 4,713,291 is an essential oil mixture including (i) 10 to 20% of lemon oil; (ii) 5 to 15% of bergamot oil; (iii) 2 to 8% of lavender oil; (iv) 2 to 8% of lemongrass oil; (v) 2 to 8% of cedarwood oil and (vi) 0.5 to 1.5% of jasmine absolute. The disclosure of U.S. Letters Patent No. 4,713,291 is incorporated by reference herein. However, U.S. Letters Patent No. 4,713,291 does not disclose the use of such fragranced fibers as an essential component of a dry wipe or a wet wipe. Antimicrobial component-containing fibers which can be sewn into textile prostheses for insertion into the body, and epidermal pads and bandages are disclosed in PCT Published Application No. 99/21507 published on May 6, 1999. However, PCT Published Application No. 99/21507 does not disclose the creation of fibers which can be used in conjunction with wet wipes or dry wipes and, fiirthermore, does not disclose the incorporation into such fibers of fragrance materials.<br>
European Published Patent Application No. 930,488 published on January 18, 1999 discloses a time-temperature indicator device comprising a polymeric layer with first and second surfaces and dye composition adhered to the first surface comprising a dye which diffuses into the polymeric layer due to the cumulative time-temperature<br>
exposure wherein the dye is invisible by visible radiation and is detectable as a result of absorption of non-visible radiation.<br>
However, the use of such color-indicating systems in fragranced fibers in European Patent Application No. 930,488 or any other prior art is neither disclosed nor inferred.<br>
The entire specifications of PCT Published Application No. 99/21507, European Published Patent Application No. 930,488 as well as U.S. Letters Patent Nos. 3,567,118 and 3,567,119 are incorporated by reference herein.<br>
In summary, although the prior art shows fragranced fibers, nothing in the prior art sets forth the creation of such fibers which have unexpected properties which permit them to be used in wet wipes or dry wipes which are permanently and continuously fragrance-emitting and optionally antimicrobial substance-emitting.<br>
THE INVENTION<br>
Our invention is directed to fragrance-imparting component-emitting fiber which controllably and continuously releases fragrance and which optionally also releases antimicrobial agent and which optionally contains at least one compatible coloring material or color-forming material which is useful for ascertainment of the exhaustion or substantial reduction of fragrance, at least for the time period of use of an article into which the fiber is woven.<br>
Thus, for example, use of such fiber involves a permanently and continuously fragrance-emitting dry or wet wipe laminar fabric article comprising a non-woven fabric lamina having woven therethrough and substantially throughout at least a major portion of the lamina surface the continuous fragrance-containing thermoplastic substantially water-insoluble fiber of our invention which controllably and continuously releases fragrance (which may also have antimicrobial properties) at least for the time period during which the fabric article is in use. Optionally, one or more antimicrobial substances may also be releasably contained in the fiber containing the fragrance or in a fiber apart therefrom. Optionally, the fiber may also contain at least one compatible coloring material or color-forming material which is useful for ascertainment of the exhaustion or substantial reduction of fragrance. The fabric article useful in conjunction with our invention optionally contains additional fragrance and/or antimicrobial agent and/or color indicator absorbed or adsorbed on the non-woven fabric lamina.<br>
Our invention is also directed to a process for creation of the fragrance-containing polymeric fiber which optionally also contains (i) at least one antimicrobial agent; and (ii) at least one compatible coloring material or color-forming material which is useful for ascertainment of the exhaustion or substantial reduction of fragrance.<br>
More specifically, the process of our invention for producing a fragrance-emitting fiber comprises the sequential steps of:<br>
(a)	providing polymer matrix particles having releasably entrapped therein at least one aroma-imparting component which optionally has efficacious antimicrobial properties in a concentration of from about 1% up to about 45% by weight of the polymer particles and optionally (i) one or more antimicrobial substances and/or (ii) at least one compatible coloring material or color-forming material which is useful for ascertainment of the exhaustion or substantial reduction of fragrance (with the polymer matrix being composed of a thermoplastic substantially water-insoluble polymer);<br>
(b)	optionally admixing the matrix particles with a compatible thermoplastic substantially water-insoluble polymer whereby a matrix polymer mixture is formed; and<br>
(c)	forming the polymer particles or matrix polymer mixture into one or more continuous fragrance-imparting component-emitting fibers of from about 3 denier up to about 60 denier.<br>
The polymer matrix particles having releasably entrapped therein at least one aroma-imparting component which optionally (i) has efficacious antimicrobial properties and/or (ii) has contained therein at least one compatible coloring material or color-forming material which is useful for ascertainment of the exhaustion or substantial reduction of fragrance may be prepared according to processes well known in the prior art, for example, the processes as set forth in U.S. Letters Patent No. 4,542,162 issued on September 17, 1985, the specification for which is incorporated herein by reference. Furthermore, such polymer matrix particles having releasably entrapped tiierein at least one aroma-imparting component may also be prepared according to United Kingdom<br>
Patent Specification No. 1,589,201 assigned to Hercules, Inc., which discloses a thermoplastic resin body consisting of a thermoplastic polymer of ethylene and 6-60 weight percent of a polar vinyl monomer selected from the group consisting of vinyl acetate, methyl acrylate, ethyl acrylate, buytl acrylate and acrylic acid wherein the perfumed resin body is suitable for the preparation of shaped objects from which the perfume odor emanates over a prolonged period at a stable level. Another process for preparing the polymer matrix particles having releasably entrapped therein at least one aroma-imparting component is U.S. Letters Patent No. 3,505,432, the specification for which is incorporated by reference herein. U.S. Letters Patent No. 3,505,432 discloses a method of scenting a polyolefin and forming polyolefin-scented particles which comprises:<br>
(a)	mixing a first amount of liquid polyolefin, e.g., polyethylene or polypropylene, with a relatively large amount of scent-imparting material to form a fiowable mass;<br>
(b)	forming drops from said mass and causing substantially instantaneous solidification of said drops into polyolefin pellets having a relatively large amount of scent-imparting material imprisoned therein;<br>
(c)	if desired, melting said pellets with a second amount of said polyolefin, said second amount being larger than said first amount; and<br>
(d)	solidifying the melt of (c).<br>
Other references which disclose microporous polymers useful in the practice of our invention are set forth as follows:<br>
(a)	U.S. Letters Patent No.  4,247,498 issued on January 27,   1981, the specification for which is incorporated by reference herein;<br>
(b)	U.S. Letters Patent No. 4,156,067 issued on May 22, 1979, the specification for which is incorporated by reference herein; and<br>
(c)	U.S. Letters Patent No. 4,521,541 issued on June 4, 1985, the specification for which is incorporated by reference herein.<br>
The resulting polymer matrix particles having releasably entrapped therein at least one aroma-imparting component, may then be further admixed with additional compatible polymer. Thus, for example, additional polypropylene may be admixed with polypropylene particles which contain between about 1 and about 45% by weight of the polymer of fragrance.<br>
Optionally, one or more compatible coloring materials or color-forming materials which are useful for ascertainment of the exhaustion or substantial reduction of fragrance may be included in the fiber. Such coloring materials are useful according to one of the following schemes:<br>
SCHEMEA<br>
(Scheme A &amp; B Removed) <br>
In the aforementioned "Scheme A," the total time for the fragrance release 8 A is<br>
large in comparison to the time needed for oxygen counterdiffusing into the fiber and reaction of said oxygen with the leuco dye to form the dye, thusly:<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
and the total time is governed by the algorithm:<br>
wherein the reciprocal of the rate of fragrance release is shown by the symbol:  <br>
which is equivalent to: and the reciprocal of oxygen diffusion rate is shown by:<br>
The symbol:   LD is the average concentration of leuco dye<br>
and the symbol: k is the reaction rate constant for the reaction of oxygen with leuco dye to form the dye.<br>
Referring to "Scheme B" as set forth, supra, again the time of fragrance release is much greater than the time of oxygen counterdiffusion into the fiber or reaction of oxygen with the dye in order to form a leuco dye, thusly:<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
wherein the symbol: A' is the time for the fragrance to disappear; and the symbol: B'<br>
is the time for the oxygen counterdiffusion; and the symbol: c' is the time for reaction<br>
of the oxygen with the dye contained in the fiber to form a leuco dye (colorless).   The aforementioned "Scheme B" is defined according to the algorithm:<br>
wherein the symbol:   D is the average concentration of dye and the symbol:  k* is the<br>
reaction rate constant for the reaction of oxygen with dye to form the leuco dye.   The total amount of time taken for the entire scheme to be carried out is shown as:<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
Color materials and color-forming materials useful in the practice of this aspect of our invention are those set forth in Published European Application No. 932602-A2 published on August 4, 1999, corresponding to PCT Application No. 99/03834-A2, the specification for which is incorporated by reference herein.<br>
Materials which form colors on reaction with oxygen are specifically set forth in German Patent No. 29909427-U1 published on July 22, 1999. Such a dye-forming system includes, for example (A) one or more specified 4,5-diamino-pyrazole derivatives such as 4-ammo-5-dimethylamino-l-methyl-lH-pyrazole and (B) one or more couplers comprising 1,3-dihydroxybenzene; 1,3-diaminobenzene; or 3-aminophenol or their derivatives. The specification of German Patent No. 29909427-U1 published on July 22,<br>
1999 is incorporated herein by reference. In addition, polymeric colorance can be used in the practice of our invention, for example, those set forth specifically in Published European Application No. 931111-A1 published on July 28, 1999, corresponding to PCT Application No. 98/10022, the specification for which is incorporated by reference herein. The corresponding U.S. PCT Application No. 1997 US-906642, the specification for which is incorporated by reference herein.<br>
Furthermore, additional coloring systems that can be used in the practice of our invention are those set forth in U.S. Letters Patent No. 5,968,206 issued on October 19, 1999, the specification for which is incorporated by reference herein. U.S. Letters Patent No. 5,968,206 discloses compositions for oxidation dyeing comprising:<br>
(a)	at least one oxidation base of a para-phenylene diamene derivative; and<br>
(b)	4-hydroxyindole as a coupler.<br>
In addition, another system useful in the practice of our invention is that disclosed in U.S. Letters Patent No. 5,968,208 issued on October 19, 1999, the specification for which is incorporated by reference herein. U.S. Letters Patent No. 5,968,208 is entitled: "NEGATIVE DYES AND COLORATION PROCESS USING THEM."<br>
The resulting mixture or the resulting polymer matrix particles having releasably entrapped therein at least one aroma-imparting component is then formulated into one or more continuous fragrance-imparting component-emitting fibers of from about 3 denier up to about 60 denier (1 denier means that 9,000 meters of fiber weigh 1 gram). The resulting mixtures can be formulated into such fibers by means of specific extruders for fiber manufacturing produced, for example, by the Davis-Standard Corporation of #1 Extrusion Drive, Pawcatuck, Connecticut 06379. Such extrusion apparatus is preferably equipped with "hot runner" systems which enable the fibers to be produced at a uniformly constant diameter and to be produced in large quantity in an efficient manner.<br>
In producing the fiber for purposes of weaving same into the lamina surface, it is preferred that the weight ratio of the polymer matrix particles having releasably entrapped therein at least one aroma-imparting component: additional compatible polymer being from about 2:1 down to about 1:1 with a preferred weight ratio of matrix particle:additional polymer being about 1.5:1.<br>
The fibers of our invention which are used for weaving through the lamina surface need not necessarily be produced from matrix particles as set forth, supra. Instead, fragrance-emitting fibers for use in weaving same through the lamina surface of non-woven fabric may be produced according to processes as set forth in:<br>
(a)	PCT Application No. 99/21507 published on May 6, 1999;<br>
(b)	U.S. Letters Patent No. 4,713,291 issued on December 15, 1987; and<br>
(c)	U.S. Letters Patent No. 3,567,118 issued on March 2, 1971.<br>
Each of the foregoing documents are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
In PCT Application No. 99/21507, there is disclosed a synthetic fiber having cavities for holding large quantities of active material exemplified by medicaments. Fragrance materials can be introduced into such fibers in place of the disclosed medicaments. Thus, alternative processes for producing such fibers are as follows:<br>
(i) manufacturing fibers by extruding a plural-component fiber from a spinneret, dissolving a soluble component to form cavities and securing a fragrance into the cavities;<br>
(ii) manufacturing fibers by extruding a single component fiber from a spinneret forming cavities and introducing therein fragrance components; and<br>
(iii) manufacturing fibers by mixing a fragrance with a polymer and extruding the resulting mixture from a spinneret and forming island-in-the-sea plural-component fibers.<br>
In U.S. Letters Patent No. 4,713,291, a fragrant sheath core composite fiber having a cross section including a sheath and a core including a hollow portion is produced wherein an aromatic perfume having a boiling point higher than 150°C under normal pressure is incorporated and dispersed in an amount of from about 0.1 up to about 10.0% by weight in a thermoplastic polymer constituting the core. The core component is preferably a polyethylene-type polymer and the sheath component is preferably a polyethylene terephthalate polymer.<br>
In U.S. Letters Patent No. 3,567,118, composite fiber materials are adapted for odorizing purposes by treating the fibrous material with a coating of a hydrophilic acrylate or methacrylate containing an appropriate essence. Entrapment of the essence can be prolonged by using a copolymer of the hydrophilic monomer with a minor amount of a hydrophobic monomer.<br>
Fragrance materials which are preferably incorporated in the polymer matrix particles or which are, in general, incorporated into the fiber, which is to be woven through the lamina surface, are preferably those fragrances which also have antimicrobial properties; for example, those set forth in Published Japanese Application No. JP101/94905 assigned to the Lion Corporation and published on July 28, 1998, to wit:<br>
(a) one or more aldehydes selected from cinnamic aldehyde, benzaldehyde,<br>
phenyl acetaldehyde, heptylaldehyde, octylaldehyde, decylaldehyde,<br>
undecylaldehyde,	undecylenic	aldehyde,	dodecylaldehyde,<br>

Other preferable fragrance compositions are those set forth in U.S. Letters Patent No. 5,420,104 issued on May 30, 1995, the specification for which is incorporated by reference herein. Such perfume compositions as described in U.S. Letters Patent No. 5,420,104 contain a cationic phospholipid having the structure:<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
wherein R is linoleamidopropyl or cocamidopropyl; and X + y = 3; a perfume base<br>
having antimicrobial activity and a fatty alcohol having from 10 up to 22 carbon atoms. Such a perfume base having antimicrobial activity contains:<br>
benzyl acetate;<br>
cyclohexyl acetate<br>
styrallyl acetate;<br>
n-octanol;<br>
n-decanol;<br>
amylcinnamic aldehyde<br>
rosewood oil;<br>
geraniol;<br>
clove oil;<br>
methyl jasmonate;<br>
hydroxycitronellal;<br>
methyl dihydrojasmonate;<br>
ylang oil; and<br>
mixture of methylionone isomers.<br>
Furthermore, perfume compositions such as those set forth in:<br>
U.S. Letters Patent No. 5,300,489 issued on April 5, 1994 (the specification for which is incorporated by reference herein);<br>
U.S.  Letters  Patent No.  5,932,771   issued  on August 3,   1999  (the specification for which is incorporated by reference herein); or<br>
U.S.  Letters Patent No.  5,942,272  issued on August 24,   1999  (the specification for which is incorporated by reference herein),<br>
may also be utilized in the fragrance-containing fiber which controllably and continually releases fragrance and which is woven through the major portion of the lamina surface of the non-woven fabric.<br>
Thus, for example, the fragrance formulation contained in the fragrance-containing fiber which controllably and continuously releases fragrance, may include:<br>
dihydromethyl jasmonic acid; geraniol; citronellol; and oil of chamomile.<br>
Along with the fragrances contained in the fragrance-containing fiber which controllably and continuously releases fragrances, the fiber may optionally have incorporated therein antimicrobial agents such as those set forth in the following list:<br>
triclosan having the structure:<br>

The fragrance-imparting component-emitting fiber or fibers of our invention may t&gt;e woven through a non-woven fabric laminar substrate across at least a major portion of the surface area of a non-woven fabric laminar substrate by means of "stitch bonding" as more specifically described in such references as U.S. Letters Patent No. 5,902,757 issued on May 11, 1999, the specification for which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
The quantity of fragrance material in the fragrance-containing fiber may vary from ibout 1% up to about 45% by weight of fragrance when no antimicrobial agent is present; M* the sum total of antimicrobial agent and fragrance may vary from about 1% up to ibout 45% by weight of the fiber when antimicrobial agent is present.   Preferably, the<br>

Other polymers that can be used for creation of the continuous fragrance-containing fiber which controllably and continually releases fragrance at least for the time period during which the fabric article is in use are disclosed in PCT Application No.<br>
US 99-05657 (PCT Serial No. 97 93 86 14.1, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein). PCT Application No. US 99-05657 discloses the fragrance-emitting specially designed hydrophilic polyurethanes with certain hydrophobic components that retain aroma chemicals in the dry state and provide sustained fragrance release upon moisture exposure. The polymers are soluble in solvent mixtures ranging from 95:5 up to 20:80 weight:weight propylene glycol:water. In addition, they are also soluble in solvent mixtures of lower alcohols:water with similar ranges. Accordingly, the fibers of our invention used in wet wipes and dry wipes, which are composed of the polymers of PCT Application No. US 99-05657, are not to be used within the scope of this invention with alcohol or propylene glycol.<br>
In forming polymer matrix particles having releasably entrapped fragrances or fragrance components therein and optionally (i) one or more antimicrobial substances entrapped therein and/or (ii) at least one compatible coloring material or color-forming material which is useful for ascertainment of the exhaustion or substantial reduction of fragrance, the procedure of U.S. Letters Patent No. 4,542,162 granted on September 17, 1985 may be utilized thusly:<br>
Foamed fragrance-containing polymeric pellets are produced by means of introduction into a single screw or twin screw extruder of, in series, thermoplastic polymer followed by fragrance followed by the introduction of a gaseous blowing agent or blowing agent which will produce a gas which is inert to the polymer and to the fragrance fluid or solid previously introduced into the extruder. Antimicrobial agent and/or coloring or color-forming agent may optionally be introduced simultaneously with the introduction of fragrance or upstream from the point of introduction of fragrance into the extruder or downstream from the point of introduction of the fragrance into the extruder.<br>
The advantages of using the foamed polymeric particles are multiple, to wit: improved handling; greater retention of fragrance; and, if desired, antimicrobial agent; greater length of time during which release of fragrance and, optionally (i) antimicrobial agent and/or (ii) coloring material or color-forming material which is useful for ascertainment of the exhaustion or substantial reduction of fragrance from polymer is at "steady state" or "zero order."<br>
The nature of the extruder utilized in the process of our invention to form the foamed polymeric fragrance-containing polymer particles of our invention may be either single screw or double screw. Thus, the types of extruders that can be used are disclosed at pages 246-267 and 332-349 of the Modern Plastics Encyclopedia, 1982-1983, published by the McGraw-Hill Publishing Company, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein.

In producing the foamed fragrance-containing polymer particles useful in the practice of our invention (which optionally contain (i) antimicrobial agent and/or (ii) at least one compatible coloring or color-forming material which is useful for ascertainment of the exhaustion or substantial reduction of fragrance), various polymers may be utilized, for example, low density polyethylene, high density polyethylene, polypropylene, the copolymer of ethylene and vinyl acetate, and polyvinyl chloride.<br>
More specifically, the polymers used in the practice of our invention may be copolymers of ethylene and a polar vinyl monomer selected from:<br>
(a)	vinyl acetate;<br>
(b)	ethyl acrylate;<br>
(c)	methyl acrylate;<br>
(d)	butyl acrylate; and<br>
(e)	acrylic acid,<br>
including the hydrolyzed copolymer of ethylene and vinyl acetate. Preferred copolymers are ethylene vinyl acetate with about 9 to 60% vinyl acetate and ethylene/ethyl acrylate with about 6 to 18% ethyl acrylate. As set forth, supra, other polymers which may be admixed with such materials include the polyurethane polymers of PCT Application No. PCT-US99-05657, incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Resins of the type disclosed for use as copolymers are commercially available in<br>
the molding powder form. For example, ethylene vinyl acetate copolymers are marketed<br>
® by the E.I. duPont de Nemours Company under the tradename "ELVAX " and by the<br>
® Arco Polymer Division under the trademark "DYLAND " and by the Exxon Corporation<br>
of Linden, New Jersey under the trademark "DEXXON ." Ethylene/ethyl acrylate copolymers are marketed by the Union Carbide Corporation under the tradename "EEA RESINS®."<br>
The polymer is added to the single screw or twin screw extruder at a feed rate in the range of from about 80 up to about 300 lbs per hour, while mamtaining the temperature in the screw extruder between about 160 and about 240°C. If the polymer or copolymer powder is added to the extruder at a reference "barrel segment," then the fragrance and, optionally, the antimicrobial agent is added to the extruder in solid or<br>
liquid fonn under pressure downstream from the addition point of the polymer at one or more "barrel segments" 2-9.<br>
Thus, this aspect of our invention provides a process for forming fragrance and optionally (i) antimicrobial and/or coloring or color-forming liquid or solid-containing foamed polymeric particles such as foamed polymeric pellets, which include a relatively high concentration of a material having at least the function of fragrancing and optionally the function of (i) imparting antimicrobial properties to the ultimately-produced fiber and/or (ii) imparting coloring or color-forming or color-bleaching properties to the ultimately-produced fiber whereby the exhaustion or substantial reduction of fragrance can be ascertained. The fragrance and optionally the antimicrobial agent and optionally the color-forming or color-imparting agent, in a fluid or solid form, are added at "barrel segments" 2-9 of the single screw or twin screw extruder. Furthermore, the fragrance and optionally antimicrobial agent and/or color-forming or color-imparting agent added at "barrel segments" 2-9 must be previously made to be compatible with the polymer added at "barrel segment" 1 of the single screw or twin screw extruder.<br>
The use as to type and proportion of fragrance and optionally (i) antimicrobial agent and/or (ii) color-forming or coloring or color-disappearing agent is limited only by either (a) their solubility in the resin or mixture of resins used and/or (b) the volume ratio of microvoids in the polymer to the said polymer and/or (c) the solubility of the fragrance and optionally (i) antimicrobial agent and/or (ii) color-forming or coloring or color-disappearing agent in the polymer on solidification. The proportion of fragrance and optionally (i) antimicrobial agent and/or (ii) color-forming or coloring or color-disappearing agent can in many instances go up to 45% by weight based on the total weight of fiber which is to ultimately be used in being woven across at least a major portion of the surface area of the non-woven fabric laminar substrate.<br>
Thus, the proportion of fragrance and optionally (i) antimicrobial agent and/or (ii) coloring agent, color-forming agent or color-disappearing agent to the weight of resin body for formation of the fiber to be woven across the non-woven fabric lamina can vary from small but effective amounts on the order of about 1% of the weight of the resin body (that makes up the fiber) up to about 45% by weight of the resin body (that makes up the weight of the fiber). In general, it is preferred to use between about 1% up to about 30% based on the weight of the resin body of the fragrance taken alone or taken together with optional (i) antimicrobial agent and/or (ii) coloring agent, color-forming agent or color-disappearing agent. This is an optimum amount balancing the proportion of fragrance and optionally (i) antimicrobial agent and/or (ii) coloring agent, color-forming agent or color-disappearing agent in the product against the time period over which the article emits the fragrance and optionally the antimicrobial agent, and against the tendency of the fragrance and optionally (i) the antimicrobial agent and/or (ii) the coloring agent, the color-forming agent or the color-disappearing agent fluid or solid to "oil out." This "oiling out" is avoided as a result of the use of foaming agent.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
Referring to Figure 1A, microporous polymer particles containing fragrance components in the interstices thereof at a location indicated by reference numeral 31. prepared according to processes as shown in Figures 4 and 5 of U.S. Letters Patent No. 5,300,489 and described in the Detailed Description of the Drawings thereof at column 2, lines 58-68, at column 3, lines 1-68 and at column 4, lines 1-13, are heated using heating means 33, to form a melt. The melt is admixed with polypropylene (nonscented) from location 32 heated by heating means 34. The mixing takes place in mixing vessel 37 (e.g., a Banbury mixer). The microporous polymer melt is passed through line 36 into mixer 37, and the polypropylene melt is passed through line 35 into mixer 37. The resulting mixture is then passed through line 38 into a thread extruder (of the type shown in Figure 6A) whereby fibers containing controllably releasable fragrance are produced. Simultaneously, non-woven fabric is produced at location 4! and conveyed via conveyor 43 to location 42.<br>
The thread produced from thread extruder 39 is conveyed via conveyor 40 to location 44 whereat the fiber is needle punched into the non-woven cloth from location 42. The needle punching may be effected according to the procedure of U.S. Letters Patent No. 5,902,757 issued on May 11, 1999, the specification for which is incorporated by reference herein. The resulting product is conveyed to location 45 where it is cut into convenient-to-use dry wipe or wet wipe articles.<br>
Referring to Figure IB, microporous fragrance particles produced according to the procedure as set forth at column 2, lines 58-68, at column 3, lines 1-68 and at column 4, lines 1-13 of U.S. Letters Patent 5,300,489 (incorporated herein by reference) is conveyed from location 46 to vessel 47 where it is heated using heating element 48. The resulting product is conveyed to thread extruder 49 (as shown in detail in Figure 6A, described, infra).   Simultaneously, non-woven fabric is produced at location 50 (for<br>
example, using the process of PCT Application No. 99/22059 published on May 6, 1999, the specification for which is incorporated by reference herein). The non-woven fabric is conveyed to location 5_1 and then to location 52 where it is needle punched with the extruded fiber from location 49. The resulting product is then conveyed to location 53 where it is cut into usable dry wipe or wet wipe articles.<br>
Referring to Figure 1C, microporous articles containing controllably releasable fragrances are prepared at location 30 (in accordance with, for example, the processes described in U.S. Letters Patent No. 4,542,162 issued on September 17, 1985, the specification for which is incorporated by reference herein). The resulting product is conveyed into apparatus 31 where it is melted using heating means 33. The resulting fragrance-containing melt is conveyed via conveyor 36 into mixing vessel 37 where the melt is mixed with polypropylene. The polypropylene (in die absence of fragrance) is melted at location 32 using heating means 34. The non-fragranced polypropylene is also conveyed into mixing vessel 37 via conveyance means 35. The resulting product, after mixing in vessel 37, is conveyed into thread extruder 39 via conveyance means 38 whereupon controllably releasable fragrance-emitting fibers are formed. Simultaneously, non-woven fabric is produced at location 4J. (according to, for example, the processes set forth in PCT Application 98/51850 published on November 19, 1998, the specification for which is incorporated by reference herein) and conveyed via conveyance means 43 to location 42. The resulting non-woven fabric is then conveyed to location 44 where it is needle punched with fragrance-emitting fiber from location 39 conveyed via conveyance means 40 to location 44. The needle punching operation is carried out in accordance with the processes such as that set forth in U.S. Letters Patent No. 5,902,757 issued on May 11, 1999, the specification for which is incorporated by reference herein. The resulting article in the form of a lamina of non-woven fabric having woven therethrough fragrance-emitting fiber is conveyed to location 54 where it is heated using heating means 55. The resulting heated article is then passed through a roller press 56 where the fibers containing the controllably releasable fragrance are sealed in place.  The resulting<br>
product is conveyed to location 57 where the resulting articles of our invention are cut into convenient shapes for use as wet wipes or dry wipes. Alternatively, the laminae containing the fragrance-emitting fiber woven therethrough may be passed directly to a hot roller press 58, heated used heating means 59. The resulting product is then conveyed to location 57 where it is conveniently cut into articles useful as dry wipes or wet wipes.<br>
Referring to Figure ID, microporous polymer particles containing controllably releasable fragrances and optionally (i) antimicrobial agent and/or (ii) at least one compatible coloring material or color-forming material which is useful for ascertainment of the exhaustion or substantial reduction of fragrance prepared at location 46 according to, for example, the process set forth at columns 2, 3 and 4 of U.S. Letters Patent No. 5,300,489 issued on April 5, 1994, the specification for which is incorporated by reference herein, are conveyed to location 47 where the particulate material is heated using heating means 48 whereby a melt is formed. The resulting fragrance-emitting melt is conveyed into fiber extruder 49 where fragrance-emitting fibers are produced. An example of such a fiber extruder is set forth in Figure 6A, described in detail, infra. The resulting fragrance-emitting fiber (which optionally emits antimicrobial agent in addition in a controlled release manner) is conveyed to location 52. Simultaneously, non-woven fabric prepared at location 50 is conveyed to location 5_1 and then to location 52 where it is needle punched with the fragrance-emitting fiber prepared at location 49. The needle punching is in accordance with such processes as the one set forth in detail in U.S. Letters Patent No. 5,902,757 issued on May 11, 1999, the specification for which is incorporated by reference herein. The resulting lamina, which is a non-woven article having woven therethrough fragrance-emitting fiber, is conveyed to location 60 where it is heated using heating means 6L The resulting heated lamina, having woven therethrough fragrance-emitting fiber, is then conveyed to roller press 62 where the fragrance-emitting fibers are firmly fixed in place. The temperatures at locations 60 and 62 and me heat input energy at locations 60 and 62 are such that although me fiber is made to be firmly in place in the<br>
non-woven fabric lamina, the fragrance (and optionally antimicrobial agent) contained in the fiber is not to any substantial extent prematurely released. The resulting product is then conveyed to location 63 where it is cut into convenient dry wipe or wet wipe articles. In the alternative, the non-woven fabric lamina having fragrance-emitting fiber woven therethrough is passed directly from location 52 through hot roller press 64, heated using heating means 65 where the fibers are fixed in place. From the hot roller press, the resulting article is conveyed to location 63. where it is conveniently cut into useful wet wipe or dry wipe articles.<br>
Referring to Figure IE, Figure IE is a schematic diagram showing apparatus for manufacturing a non-woven fabric utilizing the fibers of our invention. The method is also set forth in PCT Application No. 99/22059 published on May 6, 1999, the specification for which is incorporated by reference herein. Shown is apparatus for producing a non-woven material by hydroentangling a fiber mixture containing continuous filaments, e.g., melt-blown and/or spun-bond fibers and natural fibers and/or synthetic staple fibers. The method is characterized by foam forming a fibrous web 2014 of natural fibers and/or synthetic staple fibers and hydroentangling together the foamed fiber dispersion with the continuous filaments 2011 for forming composite material where the continuous filaments are well integrated with the rest of the fiber. The hydroentangling is carried out at location 2016, and the produced non-woven fabric is indicated by reference numeral 2024. More specifically, the foam is sucked past the wire 2012 and down through the web of melt-blown fibers laid on the wire by means of suction boxes arranged under the wire. The integrated fibrous web of melt-blown fibers and other fibers is hydroentangled while it is still supported by the wire 2012 and forms a composite material 2024. Possibly, the fibrous web can, before hydroentangling, be transferred to a special entangling wire, which possibly can be patterned in order to form a patterned non-woven fabric. The entangling station 2016 can include several rows of nozzles from which very fine water jets under very high pressure are directed against the fibrous web to provide an entangling of the fibers.  During the process, a foam-formed<br>
fibrous web 2014 from a head box 2015 is laid on top of the melt-blown layer. "Foam forming" means that a fibrous web is formed from a dispersion of fibers in a foamed liquid-containing water and a tenside. Such foam-forming technique is described in U.S. Letters Patent No. 4,443,297, the specification for which is incorporated by reference herein. Through the intensive foaming effect, there will already at this stage occur a mixing of the melt-blown fibers with the foamed fiber dispersion. Air bubbles from the intensive turbulent foam that leaves the head box 2015 will penetrate down between and push apart the movable melt-blown fibers so that the somewhat coarser foam-formed fibers will be integrated with the melt-blown fibers. Thus, after this step, there will mainly be an integrated fibrous web and no longer layers of different fibrous webs.<br>
Referring to Figure IF, a stitch-bonded, non-woven fabric sheet 3010 has a felt web 3012 with hydrophobic layer 3014 and a hydrophilic layer 3016 stitch bonded with a fragrance-emitting fiber 3018' and 3018" and 3018 to create fiber faces (3024 and 3026) over the respective outer surfaces (3020 and 3022) of the non-woven felt web (3012). Sheet 3010 may be used as a fluid-retention non-woven fabric such as to replace the facing fabric and felt layer in the wet wipe or dry wipe article which uses the fibers of our invention. As stated, supra, the fragrance-emitting fiber 3018 (prepared using the apparatus of Figure 6A, hereinafter described in detail, infra) were prepared using the process of PCT Application No. 99/20565 published on April 29, 1999 (incorporated herein by reference) may also contain (i) controllably releasable antimicrobial agent and/or (ii) at least one compatible coloring material or color-forming material which is useful for ascertainment of the exhaustion or substantial reduction of fragrance.<br>
Referring to Figure 1G, Figure 1G shows an extruded synthetic fiber according to an exemplary embodiment of the invention of PCT Application No. 99/21507 published on May 6, 1999, the specification for which is incorporated by reference herein (International Application No. PCT/US 98/22810 filed on October 28, 1998). In Figure 1G, an extruded by-component fiber 4010 is a so-called "island-in-the-sea" fiber with a<br>
substantially circular cross-sectional shape. Specifically, fiber 4010 comprises a durable "sea" circular cross-sectional shape. Specifically, fiber 4010 comprises a durable "sea" polymer 4012 which forms the bulk of fiber 4010 and four polymer "islands" 4014 having substantially circular cross sections. The polymer islands 4014 are embedded in the sea polymer 4012 and lie along the outer surface of fiber 4010 spaced apart by approximately 90° such that the islands 4014 are not totally encapsulated by the sea polymer 4012 and a portion of the outer surface of fiber 4010 is formed by the polymer islands 4014. The sea polymer 4012 of fiber 4010 may be made from any organic high polymer such as nylon, polyethylene, terephthalate or polypropylene or copolymers of propylene and ethylene or copolymers of propylene and vinyl acetate. The polymer islands 4014 are composed of a polymer such as a copolymer of ethylene and vinyl acetate containing controllably releasable fragrance and optionally containing (i) antimicrobial agent and/or (ii) at least one compatible coloring material or color-forming material which is useful for ascertainment of the exhaustion or substantial reduction of fragrance.<br>
Referring to Figures 1H, II, U, IK, 1L and 1M, these Figures all relate to a non-woven textile laminate comprising a fiberfill web substrate and face layer as described in detail in U.S. Letters Patent No. 5,925,581 issued on July 20, 1999, the specification for which is incorporated herein by reference. Thus, the textile laminate is indicated generally by reference numeral 6010. The formation of the textile laminate 6010 is illustrated in Figures 1H and II. A fiber-filled substrate 6020 is formed from first fibers 6021 at an offline or online formation station using conventional techniques such as cross-lapped card web, inline laid card web, corrugated card web, air laid web, needle ! tacked air laid web, sliver knit, flannel, brushed woven or knitted fabric, velour, flocked substrate and the like, the selection of which is well within one having ordinary skill in the art. The fiber-filled web substrate 6020 is transported from the formation station using a continuous foraminous belt 6023 mounted on rollers 6024a, 6024b. 6024c, 6024d and 6024e for movement to a fiber extrusion station 6027.  It is noted that the partially<br>
closed nip between rolls 6024c and 6024d contributes to the mechanical interentanglement. It is further noted that rolls 6024a and 6024b may comprise a single perforated cylinder, and the roll 6024b may further comprise a source of negative air pressure whereby the second fibers 6030 are drawn toward and into the fiberfill web substrate 6020. Further, the continuous foraminous belt 6023 may be threaded in a non-folded, planar manner such that rolls 6024a. 6024d and 6024e provide mechanical suspension only, while a source of negative air pressure of equivalent functions as perforated cylinder roll 6024b is supplied by a transverse manifold or plenum, and the calibrating nip or working action between rolls 6024c and 6024d may be provided in a conventional manner. The fiber diameter for meltblown-spunbonded species 6031 is very fine relative to the fiber diameter of the cross-lapped card web (fiberfill web substrate). The extruded fibers also can comprise partially oriented filaments which are easily drafted by application of mechanical force such as would be supplied by the nip between rolls 6024c and 6024d.<br>
At the fiber extrusion station 6027. an extruder 6029 extrudes the second fibers 6030 as a fiber stream 6031 to provide a face layer 6035. Such fiber stream may also include antimicrobial agents as well as fragrance agents and would act as an additional control release supplying source of fragrance material and/or antimicrobial material in addition to the fiber that is woven through the non-woven fabric. The extruded fibers preferably are meltblown thermoplastic polymer microfibers of polypropylene, polyamides (e.g., nylon 6, nylon 66), polybutylene terephthalate, polyethylene, polyethylene terephthalate, linear low density polyethylene and copolymers and blends thereof. Typically, meltblown fibers have a finer linear density of about 0.05 to 5 denier per filament. The extruded meltblown fibers are prepared using conventional techniques such as described in U.S. Letters Patent No. 3,978,185, Buntin, et aL the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety and Industrial and Engineering Chemistry, Volume 48, No. 8 (1965) at pages 1342-1356. Generally, the process involves extruding one of the thermoplastic fibers listed above through orifices (often<br>
about 34 orifices per linear inch) of a heated nozzle into a stream of hot gas or air, preferably having a controlled density to attenuate the molten resin as fibers. The temperature of the hot gas or air is typically greater than ambient temperature, but is less than the die temperature. Thus, the fibers are quenched by the hot gas or air. A particularly preferred meltblown fiber is polypropylene such as EXXON ESCORENE<br>
500 melt flow rate polypropylene available from Exxon Chemical Company of Houston, Texas.<br>
The same thermoplastic fibers can also be extruded using spunbonding techniques such as described, for example, in U.S. Letters Patent Nos. 3,338,992 and 3,341,394 to Kinney, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. Generally, the spunbonding process involves continuously extruding one of the thermoplastic fibers through a spinneret to form discrete filaments. The filaments are drawn to achieve molecular orientation and tenacity. Typically, spunbonded fibers have a coarser linear density of about 1 to 20 denier per filament. One having ordinary skill in the art will recognize that other extrusion techniques can be used, and that meltblown and spunbonded technology sometimes overlap.<br>
The extruded second fibers 6030 are laid onto the fiberfill web substrate 6020 under conditions sufficient to mechanically interentangle with the first fibers 6021 of the fiberfill web substrate 6020. Typically, this is accomplished by providing sufficient negative draft under the fiberfill web substrate 6020 and by controlling the extruder die to collector (substrate 6020) distance. The extruded second fibers tend to dither or whip back and forth on exit of the orifice or spinneret due to air turbulence. This contributes to the tendency of the second fibers to mingle among themselves and to form a web of considerable integrity prior to contact with the fiberfill web substrate 6020, and thereafter, to penetrate into and have an affinity for the fiberfill substrate and to provide mechanical interentanglement. This mechanical entanglement is illustrated in Figures 1J and   IK.     The  mechanical  interentanglement  is   comparable   to   VELCRO -type<br>
entanglement in that the different fibers tend to act similarly to the hooks and loops of<br>
® VELCRO . This controlled clinging or adherence can also be used to facilitate bonding<br>
of a decorative cover layer to form a textile laminate for the wet wipe or dry wipe articles which utilize the fibers of our invention.<br>
The extruder die to substrate (collector) distance can be used to control the texture of the fiber stream 6031 of the extruded second fibers 6030 so that the outer surface of the fiber stream 6031 on the textile laminate 6010 can be made to have either greater or less tendency to cling to other plies of textile laminate 6010, as may occur when textile laminate 6010 having only one face layer 6035 is stored in a rolled and compressed configuration. Shorter than conventional extruder die to substrate (collector) distance has been found to enhance this polishing or sealing of face layer 6035 so that storage in compressed roll form is practicable (even with additional fiber woven therethrough). Further, the degree of cringing between face layer 6035 and supplemental materials such as decorative cover sheets that are applied to textile laminate 6010 can be controlled in this way.<br>
Albeit even lighter webs of extruded second fibers 6030 can be made which are too weak to be handled as separate and independent webs, these webs also contribute desirable properties to the textile laminate 6010 when combined in the exemplary manner with a fiberfill web substrate 6020.<br>
It is noted that there is some thermal or fusion bonding of the first fibers 6021 and the extruded second fibers 6030 inasmuch as thermoplastic fibers are often used. Additionally, a face layer 6035 and a base layer 6036 can be either simultaneously in a single machine operation or in separate lines laid onto the fiberfill web substrate 6020. Additionally the face layer 6035 and base layer 6036 can be formed from the same or different fibers listed previously.<br>
The textile laminate 6010 can be used in a variety of embodiments. Generally, the textile laminate 6010 is used for its encapsulating properties (that is, encapsulating additional fragrance and/or antimicrobial agent), its resilient bulk properties or its tensile strength. As shown in Figures 1L and 1M, the textile laminate 6010 can be used in a dry wipe as the layer providing loft. Outer layers 6040a and 6040b of dry wipe material are sewn around the textile laminate.<br>
Figure 2 is a schematic cutaway elevation diagram of the extrusion and pelletizing apparatus useful in carrying out a process for producing polymer matrix particles having releasably entrapped therein at least one aroma-imparting component in a concentration of from about 1% up to about 45% by weight of the polymer particles and optionally (i) one or more antimicrobial substances and/or (ii) at least one compatible coloring material or color-forming material which is useful for ascertainment of the exhaustion or substantial reduction of fragrance.<br>
Motor 15 drives the extruder screws located at 23 A in barrel 16, the extruder being operated at temperatures in the range of about 150°C up to about 250°C. At the beginning of the barrel, resin at source VI together with additives, e.g., antimicrobial agents, coloring additives, color-forming additives, leuco dye-forming dyes, processing aids and densifiers at location 13 is added via addition funnel H into the extruder. Simultaneously (when the operation reaches "steady state"), functional fluid or solid is added to the extruder at one, two or more of barrel segments 3£ of the extruder (which may be a twin screw or single screw extruder) at locations 18a, 18b. 18c and !8d by means of gear pump 23 from source 17. From source 19 into barrel segments 5-10. the gaseous or liquid blowing agents, e.g., nitrogen, carbon dioxide and the like, are added simultaneously with the addition of functional fluid (fragrance and optionally (i) antimicrobial agents and/or (ii) at least one compatible coloring material or color-forming material which is useful for ascertainment of the exhaustion or substantial reduction of fragrance) or solid (fragrance and optionally (i) antimicrobial agent and/or (ii) at least one<br>
compatible coloring material or color-forming material which is useful for ascertainment of the exhaustion or substantial reduction of fragrance). The feed rate range of resin is about 80-300 lbs per hour. The feed rate range of the functional solid or liquid is between 1% and 35% of the feed rate range of the resin. The blowing agent rate range is such that the pressure of the gas or the pressure over the liquid being fed into the extruder is between about 50 and 200 psig. If desired, the extruded ribbon or cylinder may be passed through water bath 20 and pelletizer 2_1 into collection apparatus 21a.<br>
Figure 3 is a detailed cutaway perspective view of such a pelletizer as is used in conjunction with the apparatus of Figure 2. The extruded material coming from the water cooler which is already foamed and which already contains functional fluid or solid is fed into the pelletizer at zero pressure at location 434. The pelletizer is operated using a spinning extrusion die 436 and operated by means of a rotating wheel 434. Moving pellet knife 43J. and dual knife units 430a and 430b cause pellets to be formed which fly into a cooling water stream 432. The resulting pellets which are foamed and contain functional solid or liquid exit from the pelletizer 433.<br>
The fragrance-emitting polymer matrix particles having releasably entrapped therein at least one aroma-imparting component in a concentration of from about 1% up to about 45% can also be prepared according to the apparatus shown in Figures 4 and 5. Now referring to Figures 4 and 5, there is provided a process for forming scented polymer pellets (which also may contain optionally (i) antimicrobial agent and/or (ii) at least one compatible coloring material or color-forming material which is useful for ascertainment of the exhaustion or substantial reduction of fragrance) (wherein the polymer may be a thermoplastic polymer such as low density polyethylene or polypropylene or copolymers of ethylene and vinyl acetate or mixtures of polymers and copolymers such as copolymers of ethylene and vinyl acetate and, in addition, polyethylene) such as pellets useful in the formation of plastic particles useful in fabricating the wet wipes and dry wipes which use the fibers of our invention.   This<br>
process comprises heating the polymer or mixture of polymers to the melting point of said polymer or mixture of polymers, e.g., 250°C in the case of low density polyethylene. The lower most portion of the container is maintained at a slightly lower temperature, and the material in the container is taken off at such location for delivery through the conduit Thus, referring to Figures 4 and 5, in particular, the apparatus used in producing such elements comprises a device for forming the polymer containing perfume, e.g., polyethylene or polyethylene/ polyvinyl acetate or mixtures of same or polypropylene, which comprises a vat or container 212 into which the polymer taken alone or in admixture with other copolymers and the perfuming substance and optionally (i) the antimicrobial substance and/or (ii) at least one compatible coloring material or color-forming material which is useful for ascertainment of the exhaustion or substantial reduction of fragrance is placed. The container is closed by means of an airtight lid 228 and clamped to the container by bolts 265. A stirrer 273 traverses the lid or cover 228 in an airtight manner and is rotatable in a suitable manner. A surrounding cylinder having heating coils 212A which are supplied with electric current through cable 214 from a rheostat or control 216 is operated to maintain the temperature inside the container 212 such that the polymer in the container will be maintained in a molten or liquid state. It has been found advantageous to employ polymers at such a temperature that the viscosity will be in the range of 90-100 Saybolt seconds. The heater 218 is operated to maintain the upper portion of the container 212 within a temperature range of, for example, 220-270°C in the case of low density polyethylene. The bottom portion of the container 2_12 is heated by means of heating coils 212A regulated through the control 220 connected thereto through a connecting wire 222 to maintain the lower portion of the container 212 within a temperature range of 220-270°C.<br>
Thus, the polymer or mixture of polymers added to the container 212 is heated from 10-12 hours, whereafter the perfume composition or perfume material (and optionally (i) antimicrobial material and/or (ii) at least one compatible coloring material or color-forming material which is useful for ascertainment of the exhaustion or<br>
substantial reduction of fragrance) is quickly added to the melt Generally, about 10-45% by weight of the resulting mixture of the perfumery substance (taken together optionally with (i) antimicrobial agent and/or (ii) at least one compatible coloring material or color-forming material which is useful for ascertainment of the exhaustion or substantial reduction of fragrance) is added to the polymer.<br>
After the perfume material (and optionally (i) antimicrobial agent and/or (ii) at least one compatible coloring material or color-forming material which is useful for ascertainment of the exhaustion or substantial reduction of fragrance) is added to the container 212, the mixture is stirred for a few minutes, for example, 5-15 minutes, and maintained within the temperature ranges indicated previously by the heating coil 212A. The controls 216 and 220 are connected through cables 224 and 226 to a suitable supply of electric current for supplying the power for heating purposes.<br>
Thereafter, the valve "V" is opened permitting the mass to flow outwardly through conduit 232 having a multiplicity of orifices 234 adjacent to the lower side thereof. The outer end of the conduit 232 is closed so the liquid polymer in intimate admixture with the fragrances (and optionally (i) antimicrobial agent and/or (ii) at least one compatible coloring material or color-forming material which is useful for ascertainment of the exhaustion or substantial reduction of fragrance) will continuously drop through the orifices 234 downwardly from the conduit 232. During this time, the temperature of the polymer intimately admixed with the perfumery substance (and optionally (i) antimicrobial agent and/or (ii) at least one compatible coloring material or color-forming material which is useful for ascertainment of the exhaustion or substantial reduction of fragrance) in the container 212 is accurately controlled so that a temperature in the range of from about 240-250°C, for example (in the case of low density polyethylene), will exist in the conduit 232. The regulation of the temperature through the controls 216 and 220 is essential in order to insure temperature balance to provide for the continuous dropping or dripping of molten polymer intimately admixed with the perfume substance<br>
(and, optionally, antimicrobial agent) through orifices 234 at a rate which will insure the formation of droplets 236 which will fall downwardly onto a moving conveyor belt 238 caused to run between conveyor wheels 240 and 242 beneath the conduit 232.<br>
When the droplets 236 fall onto the conveyor 238. they form pellets 244 which harden almost instantaneously and fall off the end of the conveyor 238 into a container 250 which is advantageously filled with water or some other suitable cooling liquid in order to insure the rapid cooling of each of the pellets 244. The pellets 244 are then collected from the container 250 and utilized for formation into the thread as shown, for example, in Figure 6A.<br>
Referring to Figures 6A and 6B, molding mix containing foamed or non-foamed polymeric particles 86 is fed into a plasticizing cylinder through hopper 85. When the mold opens, the cylinder plunger 89 moves back permitting material to drop into the cylinder. On the closing stroke, the mold members lock tightly together, and the cylinder plunger moves forward forcing the newly delivered material from the hopper into the heating zone of the cylinder 90. The polymeric particles 86 already contain fragrance and optionally (i) antimicrobial agent and/or (ii) at least one compatible coloring material or color-forming material which is useful for ascertainment of the exhaustion or substantial reduction of fragrance. This material in turn displaces a "shot" of molten material through the nozzle 93 into the thread-forming part of the apparatus through orifice Hi. The apparatus shown by reference numeral 100. in general, is a "hot runner" system as manufactured by Ewikon N.A. Incorporated of 665 Tollgate Road, Station "F," Elgin, Illinois 60123. The entry part of the hot runner system of the apparatus of Figure 6A is through port 101. The block is heated using heating elements 110a and 110b. Entry port 101 diverges into two streams, 102a and 102b. In turn, the two lines in the hot runner system, 102a and 102b. further diverge into a number of additional lines (shown as five lines each, indicated by reference numerals 104a and 104b) through manifolds indicated by reference numerals 103a and 103b. At the exits of the "hot runner" system<br>
are exit valves indicated by reference numerals 105a and 105b. which are usually controlled via electronic data processing systems. A detail enlarged drawing of an exit valve system is set forth in Figure 6B. The actual controlling valve is indicated by reference numeral 105. a remote control valve. The overall exit port is indicated by reference numeral 104. The actual exit orifice is indicated by reference numeral 108 (an "adjustable" nozzle for fiber diameter variation). The adjustment of the nozzle is made through adjusting mechanism 108a. The fibers pass through cooling chambers indicated by reference numerals 114a and 114b. The cooled fiber containing controllably releasable fragrance and optionally (i) controllably releasable antimicrobial agent and/or (ii) at least one compatible coloring material or color-forming material which is useful for ascertainment of the exhaustion or substantial reduction of fragrance is shown by reference numeral JU2 and is wound up on a spool indicated by reference numeral 107 for subsequent use in, for example, weaving the fiber or needle punching the fiber through a non-woven laminar fabric article.<br>
Now referring to Figure 7, Figure 7 sets forth a simplified cutaway side elevation view of a cross section of the wet wipe or dry wipe article using the fibers of our invention. Reference numeral 21 shows a non-woven fabric layer of the type produced according to U.S. Letters Patent No. 5,925,581 issued on July 20, 1999, the specification for which is incorporated by reference herein. Reference numeral 70 indicates the fiber produced using the apparatus of, for example, Figures 6A and 6B. The fiber is needle punched or woven through the layers of non-woven fabric 7L The overall article is indicated by reference numeral 700. Figures 7 A, 7B, 7C, 7D and 7E set forth photomicrographs of a wet wipe or dry wipe article using the fibers of our invention. Reference numeral 710 sets forth the photomicrographs in general. The fiber indicated by reference numeral 70 is the fragrance-emitting (and optionally antimicrobial agent-emitting) fiber produced using the apparatus, for example, of Figures 6A and 6B. Reference numeral 21 shows the fibers of the non-woven fabric produced, for example, according to the process of U.S. Letters Patent No. 5,925,581 issued on July 20, 1999,<br>
incorporated herein by reference; or using the apparatus of PCT Application No. 99/22619 published on May 14, 1999, incorporated herein by reference; or using the process of U.S. Letters Patent No. 5,454,142 issued on October 3, 1995 (title: "NON-WOVEN FABRIC HAVING ELASTOMETRIC AND FOAM-LIKE COMPRESSIBILITY AND RESILIENCE AND PROCESS THEREFOR"), incorporated herein by reference.<br>
