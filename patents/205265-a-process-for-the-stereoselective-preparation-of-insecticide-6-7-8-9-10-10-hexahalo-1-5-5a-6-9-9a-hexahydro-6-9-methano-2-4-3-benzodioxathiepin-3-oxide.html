The following specification particularly describes the nature of this invention and the manner in which it is to be performed<br><br><br><br>

This invention relates to a process for the stereoselective preparation of insecticide 6,7,8,9,10,10-hexahalo-l,5,5a,6,9,9a-hexahydro-6,9-methano-2,4,3-benzodioxathiepin-3-oxide.<br>
6,7,8,9,10,10-hexahalo-1,5,5a,6,9,9a-hexahydro-6,9-methano-2,4,3-benzodioxathiepin-3-oxide are of the formula I;<br><br>
Formula I<br>
wherein X may be a halogen such as fluorine, chlorine or bromine.<br>
PRIOR ART<br>
US Patent No 2799685 describes unsaturated polycyclic sulfites of the general formula II;<br><br><br><br>
wherein X may be hydrogen or halogen or alkyl group and Y may be hydrogen or alkyl group, and their derivatives containing two hydrogen atoms in 5,6-positions. These compounds are reported to exhibit insecticidal activity. The process for the preparation of these compounds comprises heating a diol of the general formula III:<br><br><br><br>
wherein X and Y are each as defined above, with thionyl chloride under heating optionally in an inert organic solvent. The products is reported to be a mixture of two isomers. The desired isomer may be resolved from the mixture, for instance by fractional crystallization using petroleum ether.<br>
US    Patent    No    3251856    describes    a    process    for    the resolution/separation   of  the   two   isomers   viz   a   and   B-isomers   of 6,7,8,9,10,10-hexachloro-1,5,5a,6,9,9a-hexahydro-6,9-methano-2,4,3-benzodioxathiepin-3-oxide, commonly known as endosulfan of the formula IA:<br><br>
Formula 1A The resolution process comprises contacting the endosulfan isomeric mixture with a halogenated hydrocarbon solvent at 40-50°C<br><br><br>
followed by cooling the mixture to 20-50 C. The resulting insoluble portion in the mixture is reported to predominantly contain the high melting isomer viz B-isomers of endosulfan whereas the solution portion when subjected to evaporation results in a residue which is reported to predominantly contain the low melting isomer viz ά-isomers of endosulfan. The a and B-isomers so obtained may be purified by crystallization from alcohol.<br>
Both the isomers of endosulfan are reported to exhibit different insecticidal properties. For instance, in short exposure periods, a-endosulfan is more effective against flies than B-endosulfan. In the case of fruit flies Drosophila melanogaster, the killing times (LT50) with the use of a endosulfan and B-endosulfan are in the ratio 1:3 respectively. Insecticidal effectiveness or efficacy a-endosulfan against wood boring insects is more as compared to B-endosulfan . Insecticidal effectiveness limit per m3 wood with the larvae of the house longhorn beetle Hylotupes bajulus L is more in the case of B-endosulfan as compared to a-endosulfan (Mater. Org. 1983, 18(2), 81-91, Kuehne Helmut et al; CA 100 : 134245a). Both the isomers differ in insecticidal persistence and biodegradability. a-Endosulfan decomposes rapidly by soil microorganisms when compared to B-endosulfan (Karachi Univ J. Sci; 1985, 13(2), 191-7, Akhtar Shahida et al;<br><br>
CA 107 : 91836u). a-Endosulfan is degradable by both bacteria and fungi, whereas β-endosulfan is degradable mainly by bacteria (Int. J Environ. Stud, 1981, 16(3-4), 171-80, El Beit, I O D et al ; CA 94 : 151865c). B-endosulfan has greater half life than a-endosulfan under varying environmental conditions (J. Environ. Sci. Health, Part B, 1995, B30 (2), 221-32, Ceron JJ et al; CA 122 : 180980 p). Therefore, treatment with β-endosulfan is particularly preferred to achieve desired efficacy over a long term.<br>
The a and β-isomers of endosulfan are reported to be obtained in the average isomeric ratio of about 2:1 (US Patent No 3251856). Due to the differences in the physical, chemical and biological properties of a and B-endosulfan and a and β- benzodioxathiepin compounds in general, it is advantageous to have increased quantity of the desired stereoisomer in the isomeric mixture depending upon the intended specific application of the benzodioxathiepin compound. In order to obtain required quantity of a desired isomer of the benzodioxathiepin compound, correspondingly large quantities of the substrate viz the diol compound is required. Therefore, the above process is uneconomical. Besides, it also generates the undesired isomer in the ratio 2:1 and its efficiency is low.<br><br>

DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION<br>
According to the invention there is provided a process for the stereoselective preparation of insecticide 6,7,8,9,10,10-hexahalo-l,5,5a,6,9,9a-hexahydro-6,9-methano-2,4,3-benzodioxathiepin-3-oxide of the general formula I:<br><br>
Formula I<br>
wherein X is a halogen such as fluorine, chlorine or bromine, comprising reacting l,4,5,6,7,7-hexahalo-5-norbornene-2,3-dimethanol of the general<br><br>
formula IV:<br><br><br><br>
Formula IV wherein X is as defined above, with a cyclic sulfite ring forming reagent optionally in an inert organic solvent at ambient to 139°C, wherein the reaction is carried out in the presence of a stereoisomer directing agent comprising an isomer of the compound of the formula I different from the desired isomer, the molar ratio of the stereoisomer directing agent to the dimethanol compound of the formula IV being at least 0.07.<br>
Preferably the process comprises preparation of a-isomer of the benzodioxathiepin-3-oxide compound in which its β-isomer is used as the stereoisomer directing agent, in the molar ratio of 0.2 to 0.8 to the dimethanol compound of the forrnula IV. Preferably the process comprises preparation of β-isomer of the benzodioxathiepin-3-oxide compound in<br><br><br><br>
which its a-isomer is used as the stereoisomer directing agent, in the molar ratio of 1.7 to 4.3 to the dimethanol compound.<br>
Preferably the process comprises preparation of a-isomer of 6,7,8,9,10,10-hexachloro-1,5,5a,6,9,9a-hexahydro-6, 9-methano-2,4,3-benzodioxathiepin-3-oxide ie endosulfan (compound of the formula I wherein X is chlorine) in which its β-isomer is used as the stereoisomer directing agent, the molar ratio   of the β-isomer of endosulfan to 1,4,5,6,7,7-hexachloro-5-norbornene-2,3-dimethanol ie endosulfandiol (compound of the formula IV wherein X is chlorine) being 0.2 to 0.8. Preferably the process comprises preparation ofβ-isomer of 6,7,8,9,10,10-hexachloro- 1,5,5a,6,9,9a-hexahydro-6,9-methano-2,4,3-benzodioxathiepin-3-oxide ie endosulfan (compound of the formula I wherein X is chlorine) in which its a-isomer is used as the stereoisomer directing agent, molar ratio of the a-isomer of endosulfan to 1,4,5,6,7,7-hexachloro-5-norbornene-2,3-dimethanol ie endosulfandiol (compound of the formula IV wherein X is chlorine) being 1.7 to 4.3.<br>
The cyclic sulfite ring forming reagent is preferably thionyl<br>
chloride.<br><br><br>
The inert organic solvent may be aromatic hydrocarbon such as toluene or isomer of xylene such as o-xylene, m-xylene p-xylene or mixture thereof, aliphatic hydrocarbon such as n-hexane, octane, chlorinated aliphatic or aromatic hydrocarbon such as 1,2-dichloroethane, 1,1,2-trichloroethane, carbontetrachloride or trichloromethane or cyclo aliphatic hydrocarbon such as cyclohexane or any such solvent of petroleum origin. Preferably, toluene, o-xylene or carbontetrachloride is used as the solvent. When an inert organic solvent is not used, the reaction may be carried out in the presence of excess of cyclic sulfite ring forming reagent.<br>
The stereoisomer directing agent is separated from the reaction mass in known manner, for instance by the method described in US Patent No 3251856.<br>
According to the invention practically only one of the desired isomers viz a or β isomer is selectively prepared in high purity by using the stereoisomer directing agent, depending upon the specific intended use thereof. For instance, to give treatments lasting a longer duration, compound of the formula I wherein X is chlorine ie endosulfan, enriched<br><br><br>
with the β-isomer is prepared, whereas for treating wood ά-endosulfan enriched product is prepared. Thus the process of the invention results in a product enriched with the desired isomer. Besides, for a given amount of the starting material the process produces the compound of the formula I enriched with the desired isomer practically devoid of the undesired isomer without consuming additional quantities of the starting material. Therefore, the process is economical and efficient  Since no foreign reagent is used in the reaction and the process uses the a and B isomer of the compound of the formula I itself as the stereoisomer directing agent for the preparation of B or a isomer respectively, formation of impurities is avoided. The stereoisomer directing agent in the product mixture is recovered and recused.<br>
The following experimental examples are illustrative of the invention but not limitative of the scope thereof.<br>
Selectivity of the process for a -endosulfan/ B-ensosulfan was calculated by the equation :<br>
Selectivity = ά -endosulfan / β-endosulfan obtained (g) X 100 endosulfan product (g)<br><br>
The weight of endosulfan product was computed after subtracting the weight of SIDC-A/SIDE-B added in the reaction mixture from the weight of the product mixture.<br>
Example 1 Endosulfandiol (250 g. 0.693 mole), carbontetrachloride (750 ml) and β-endosulfan [stereoisomer directing agent (SIDC-A), 20g, 0.049 mole, mole ratio of SIDC-A : endosulfandiol :: 0.071] were heated to 65°C with stirring, Thionyl chloride (55 ml, 0.7556 mole) was added to the reaction mixture and the reaction mixture was heated to 75°C for 2 hours. HC1 generated during the reactioin was scrubbed with alkali solution. The reaction mass was cooled to 30°C. Excess thionyl chloride was neutralized with dilute aqueous 6.5% weight/weight soda ash solution to pH 6.5.  The<br>
aqueous layer was discarded.   From the organic layer, carbontetrachloride<br>
o!v-' was distilled off under reduced pressure. The product mixture weighing 290<br>
g was analysed for a-endosulfan content by Gas chromatography (GC) and<br>
was found to contain 202.7 g of a -endosulfan.   SIDC-A in the product<br>
mixture was separated from the a-endosulfan as per the procedure of US<br>
Patent No 3251856 and reused.    The selectivity of the process for a-<br>
endosulfan was found to be 75.07%.<br><br>

Thionyl chloride (55ml, 0.7556 mole) was added to the reaction mixture and the reaction mixture was heated to 75°C for 2 hours. HCl generated during the reaction was scrubbed with alkali solution. The reaction mass was cooled to 30°C. Excess thionyl chloride was neutralised with dilute aqueous 6.5% weight/weight soda ash solution to pH 6.5. The aqueous layer was discarded. From the organic layer, carbontetrachloride was distilled off under reduced pressure. The product mixture weighing 374 g was analysed for B - endosulfan content by Gas Chromatography (GC) and was found to contain 106.9 g of a and B-endosulfan. SIDC-B in the product mixture was separated from the B-endosulfan as per the procedure of US Patent No 3251856 and reused. The selectivity of the process for B -endosulfan was found to be 39.01 %.<br><br><br>
Examples 43 to 53 The procedure of Examples 42 was followed with varying quantities of SIDC-B and the results were as in the following Table 5:<br><br>

The results of Examples 1 to 36 as shown in Tables 1 to 3 clearly show that selectivity of the process for a-endosulfan depends on the molar ratio of SIDC-A to endosulfandiol.   Similarly   the results of Examples  42 to 77   as shown in Table s 5 to 7 clearly show that selectivity   of the process  for  13 -endosulfan depends   on the molar ratio of SIDC-B to endofulfandiol. The results of Examples 37 to 41 and 78 to 82 as shown in Tables 4 and 8 clearly indicate that temperature has practically no effect on the selectivity of the process for a -endosulfan to β-endosulfan.<br><br>
