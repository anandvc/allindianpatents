				<td>The invention concerns a package for holding a disc-shaped information disc, in particular a compact disc, with a disc holder made as a plastic injection moulding and provided with a hollow in which the information disc can be inserted from above, further with holding elements formed integrally on the disc holder for the information disc inserted in the hollow, and also further with an essentially rectangular cover for the disc holder which along one of its edges is attached to the disc holder, while the opposite free edge of the cover can be fixed releasably to the disc holder by means of a closure member.<br>
Packages of this kind are known in the most varied designs and have been most widely used up to now in the preservation of compact discs in the audio sphere.<br>
A generic package for them is e.g. the so-called jewel box which is a worldwide leader and which is composed of bottom and top portions made of transparent plastic as well as a disc holder located between them. The bottom and top portions are structurally designed in such a way that paper information documents, booklets or the like can be inserted manually or mechanically. Folding these information documents twice at opposite edges of the end of the package also affords the advantage that the folded regions can be written on like book spines. The bottom and top portions are pivotably joined together at a common edge by a hinge device and can thus be opened up like a book. The disc holder, also called the tray, is automatically fitted with a CD in appropriate machines and then inserted in the bottom portion with a press fit. On the disc holder are formed clamping elements which engage in the centre hole of a CD and lock it as a result.<br>
Since however compact discs are gaining increasing importance as data carriers in the computer sphere, so-called CD-ROMs, and so are being used more and more often<br>
as a supplement with computer magazines too, there is a need for a package which meets the requirement of a design which is flat and lightweight yet resistant to warping and affording sufficient protection from environmental effects.<br>
With respect to these properties, the above known CD package however has disadvantages both in manufacture and relating to use. Thus the disc holder, owing to the information document still to be inserted in between, cannot already be inserted in the bottom portion during manufacture, so that expensive separate handling of top and bottom portions, disc holder and text supplements is necessary. Moreover packages of this kind are relatively bulky and heavy due to the thickness of at least 8 mm, which can hardly be reduced structurally.<br>
Also known is a package consisting of a cardboard pack divided into three panels, on which is glued centrally a rectangular disc holder of a known kind pressed from plastic. The two outer thirds of the cardboard pack can be folded inwards like wings and then form, overlapping one on top of the other, the cover for the upper side of the disc holder. Text information can be printed on the front and reverse sides of this package up to the surface glued to the disc holder. In addition text supplements or booklets which can be opened outwards can also be mounted on the inner surfaces of the wings. A disadvantage with this known package proves to be the lack of an option to lock the cover, so that the latter can open by itself. To obtain sufficient resistance to warping, the two wings form in the closed state a double lid, with the result that the known package ultimately corresponds to the jewel box in external dimensions and hence is also relatively bulky and heavy.<br>
In another known package, a rectangular disc holder injection moulded from plastic is glued to a surface of a foldable cardboard pack enveloping the disc holder in the<br>
closed state. By means of a closure member connected to the disc holder by a hinge and encompassing the cover, the free edge of the cover can be fixed to the disc holder. Admittedly this package can basically be made easily and cheaply and, due to the possibility of locking the cover with a closure member, also affords good protection against environmental effects, but due to its external dimensions and the use of solid cardboard material for reasons of stability it is relatively bulky and heavy..<br>
The predetermined break points disclosed in US 5,310,053 only function to afford a single element injection moulding for the tray 52 and the base 54 c.p. column 5, lines 41 to 46, and also for the cap 140 and the holder 50, c.p. column 6, lines 34 to 38.<br>
"The cap 140 is preferably formed of plastic, typically a rigid or semi-rigid plastic, and may conveniently be injection moulded separately or in conjuction with the holder 50, connected thereto by breakable bridges in order to permit subsequent separation".<br>
After injection moulding the capo and the holder are initially connected via said predetermined points (breakable bridges"). Then they have to be separated by breaking the breakpoints, so that they can be rearranged and that the package can be mounted afterwards.<br>
In contrast to this, the predetermined break points of the invention function as a simple but effective sealing before the first time use of the CD (by the consumer) , page 9, paragraph 2. After moulding, the closure member 3 is then folder over about the material connections 17 now acting as hindges, until the fastening sections 16 engage in snap or latch elements. In this position the material connections are still intact, so that between disc holder 1 and closure member 3 there is both material locking and Form locking. Only then the CD is inserted in the package and the cover is glued to the gluing points. From this moment on the CD can only be taken out of the package by firstly releasing the closure member 3 from the disc holder. This is only possible by way of destroying the material connections, so that a simple but effective sealing is achieved.<br>
Such a securing function can not be achieved with the package disclosed in the US 5,310, 053 because before closing this package for the first time, that means before connecting the closure member to the cover, the break points between closure member and disc holder have to be broken necessarily. A sealing function for the CD by these predetermined break points before the first time opening of the package is therefore impossible.It is therefore the object of the invention to develop a package for holding a disc-shaped information disc, in particular a compact disc, in such a way that it can be made more easily, quickly and cheaply and at the same time it is distinguished from the known packages by a particularly flat and lightweight design.<br>
To achieve this, in. a package of the kind mentioned hereinbefore it is proposed that the closure member is rigidly connected to the free edge of the cover.<br>
Due to such a package, form-locking fastening of the cover to the disc holder which ensures a particularly flat and lightweight design is achieved in the closed state in a simple manner.<br>
... In another advantageous embodiment of the invention the closure member is -a plastic strip which over the whole length of the free edge is connected to the latter.<br>
Due to this design the cover acquires increased strength<br>
i<br>
and stability, and it is evenly stretched on closure of the" package.<br>
To achieve long-lasting and convenient opening and closing of the package when it is used often, it is further proposed that the closure member is provided with fastening sections which -cooperate- -with -correspondingly ~sliaped snap or latch elements on the disc holder"inorder<br>
to fix the closure member to the disc holder.<br>
Preferably the closure member is glued to the cover, as this is a simple and cheap method of manufacture.<br>
Basically the cover can be made of all suitable materials, for example flexible plastic film. However, a cover made of paper or cardboard which allows a cheap and lightweight design of the package is proposed as particularly suitable. Furthermore paper has the advantage that the sheath can be printed with information and so no manufacturing costs for the insertion of text supplements are incurred.<br>
In a preferred embodiment the cover is glued to the lower side of the disc holder and additionally to a strip-like surface of the disc holder facing upwards and extending along the edge. In this way a firm, non-slip fit of the cover is ensured. Also the upwardly facing strip-like gluing surface causes a uniform fold edge to be formed on the upper side of the disc holder, which allows reliable opening and closing of the cover.<br>
In order for the package to be very flat and so particularly suitable as a supplement to magazines, advantageously the thickness measured between upper and lower sides of the disc holder is 2 mm to 4 mm.<br>
With the invention it is further proposed that disc holder and closure member as components of one and the same plastic injection moulding are materially connected by at least one predetermined break point. In this way the package can be made from a single plastic part, so that very easy and cheap manufacture is the result.<br>
According to another preferred embodiment of the invention it is proposed that the predetermined break point extends only over a central section of the elongate-shaped closure member, and that this central section of the closure member is adjoined at both ends by fastening sections which cooperate with correspondingly shaped snap or latch elements on the disc holder in order to fix the closure member to the disc holder. As a<br>
result, the closure member in the closed state in dual function acts as a snap and clamp closure.<br>
For the purpose of sealing the package it is proposed that several dot-like material connections arranged in a row serve as predetermined break points. In this way, in addition to easy breaking off of the<br>
closure member,  subsequent clamping by the broken-off<br>
i,<br>
webs is obtained. If disc holder and closure member are simultaneously materially connected by the predetermined break point up to the moment of desired breaking of the predetermined break point, as also connected in form-locking relationship by snap or latch elements, then it is not possible to restore the package to the original state after opening for the first time. Thus there is inherent sealing protection of the information disc due to manufacture, also making it difficult to steal it from the closed package.<br>
Appropriately the predetermined break point is broken by bending the closure member relative to the disc holder, so that at the same time greater protection against falling out when opening the package is ensured.<br>
To obtain the possibility of space-saving and simple stacking of several packages, it is further proposed that the lower side of the disc holder is a plane, level surface.<br>
Finally it is proposed that lateral guide gaps are located on the lower side of the disc holder, so that<br>
i<br>
directed non-slip stacking can take place.<br>
Therefore, the present invention relates to a package for holding a disc-shaped information disc, in particular a compact disc comprising:<br>
(a)	a disc holder consisting of a plastic injection moulding<br>
and provided with a hollow in which the information disc<br>
can be inserted from above;<br>
(b)	holding elements  formed integrally on  the  said disc<br>
holder for the information disc inserted in the said<br>
hollow;<br>
(c)	an  essentially  rectangular  cover  for  the  said  disc<br>
holder, which is connected with a first edge to the said<br>
disc holder;<br>
(d)	a closure member, which is rigidly connected to the other<br>
edge of the said cover and which is together with the<br>
said disc  holder  a  component  of  one  and  the  same<br>
injection moulded plastic part,<br>
characterized in that :<br>
the material connection between said disc holder and the said closure member is at least one predetermined break point, and in that in broken state of the said at least one predetermined break point the said closure member, already connected to the said cover, is detachably secured to the said disc holder.<br>

t<br>
disc holder and closure member.<br>
The package of the invention according to Fig. 1 consists of a flat disc holder 1 having a thickness of 2 to 4 mm, a cover 2 enveloping it as well as a closure member 3, the cover 2 preferably being made of paper or cardboard. The disc holder 1 as well as the closure member 3 are made in one piece from usually transparent or coloured plastic by injection moulding, i.e. until the user opens the package for the first time they are<br>
components  of  one  and  the  same  plastic  injection moulding.<br>
As Fig. 2 shows, the disc holder 1 has an approximately rectangular shape in basic outline, in the upper side of which is formed a more or less square hollow 4 in which can be inserted for example a compact disc (CD) or other information disc.<br>
According to Figures 5 and 5a, in the central region are integrally formed resilient, slightly oversized holding elements 5, so that the CD which is usually provided with a central hole can be slid over the holding elements under slight pressure, in order then to be centred in clamping relationship in this position. The holding elements 5 consist of two mutually opposed, part-circular clamping rings which on each of their inwardly directed sides are bordered by a slot 6 which passes through the disc holder and so produces a resilient effect. The slot 6 has at both ends a short, radially extending section 6a from which in turn undercuts 6b, which also pass through the disc holder, surround the holding elements 5 on the outside thereof in a part circle. As a result the holding effect of the holding elements 5 is improved. A web 6c shown in broken lines in Fig. 5 and interrupting the slot 6 can lead to a further improvement of the holding force on the CD. The holding elements 5 are designed so flat that their upper edge does not protrude beyond the height of the remaining<br>
t<br>
regions of the 2 mm to 4 mm thick disc holder 1.<br>
It can further be seen from Fig. 2 that ribs 7 arranged concentrically with the centre hole of the CD support the inserted CD from below in its outermost uncoated edge region and so afford protection against scratching.<br>
Within the hollow 4 rises moreover a reinforcing rib 8 which surrounds the information disc protectively and which in the corner regions of the hollow 4 is extended<br>
by approximately semicircular indentations 9, so that by passing a fingernail underneath, the compact disc can be lifted off the disc holder 1 easily and with direction. An alternative embodiment in which the indentations 9 are shaped into elliptical gripping holes 10 partly covered by an inserted CD is shown in Fig. 6.<br>
Along two side edges facing away from each other the disc holder 1 is provided with a vertical end edge 11 (see Figs. 7 and la) which projects slightly in height beyond the other structural members and which leads into a strip-like surface 12 sloping outwards and downwards and forming the rear edge of the disc holder 1. Over the same length and width, on the lower side of the disc holder 1 are formed complementary guide gaps (not shown) in which the vertical edge 11 engages when several disc holders are stacked, which ensures directed non-slip stacking. To obtain easy, automatable handling of the stacked packages, further the lower side of the strip-like surface 12 is offset slightly inwards from the remainder of the plane lower side of the disc holder 1 (not shown), so that recesses are formed between packages one on top of the other, allowing gripping from the front with appropriate gripping tools.<br>
The edge of the disc holder 1 opposite the strip-like surface 12 is formed by open-topped, hook-shaped snap or latch elements 13 which cooperate with corresponding fastening sections of the closure member 3 to allow closure of the package.<br>
Details of the closure member 3 are described below with the aid of Figures 4 and 13. The closure member 3 consists of an essentially rectangular plastic strip which extends across the whole width of the disc holder 1 and whose upper side forms a plane gluing surface 15 (see Fig. 13) and whose lower side 14a in a central section is provided with slightly raised gripping elements 14 having a finger's width, whose ends are adjoined by fastening<br>
sections 16 corresponding to the snap or latch elements of the disc holder 1 (see Fig. 4). The gripping elements 14 are used for, apart from better ergonomic handling of the closure member, bracing of the flat plastic strip as well, so that exact low-warp opening of the package is achieved.<br>
After injection moulding in a common injection moulding die, disc holder 1 and closure member 3 are joined together by several dot-like material connections 17 arranged in a row between the snap and latch elements 13 or fastening sections 16, which is shown by Figures 3 and 8. The closure member 3 is in this case oriented perpendicularly to the disc holder 1. With the injection moulding made in this way, the closure member 3 is then folded over about the material connections 17 now acting as hinges, until the two fastening sections 16 engage in the snap or latch elements. At this moment the material connections 17, which serve as predetermined break points, are still intact, so that between disc holder 1 and closure member 3 there is both material locking by the material connections 17 and form locking by the fastening sections 16 clamped fast in the snap or latch elements 13. Only then is the CD inserted in the package and then the cover 2 is glued at the gluing points provided therefor to the injection moulding which is still in one piece. From this moment on the CD can only be taken out of the package by first releasing the closure member 3 from the disc holder 1. The first time, this is possible only after previously destroying the material connections 17, so that simple but effective sealing is achieved before using the CD for the first time.<br>
The material connections 17 are designed in such a way that they permit pivoting a single time after the fashion of a hinge, whereas when they are pivoted back subsequently they break due to material fatigue.<br>
The disc holder 1 is glued to the cover 2 which envelops it in the closed state of the package and which is made of a single sheet of paper, cardboard or film. The double-hatched areas shown in Figures 11 to 13 are suitable as gluing surfaces for this. At the same time either the complete plane lower side of the disc holder 1 can be used as the lower gluing surface 18 (see Figure 11) or alternatively only two narrow sections 18a which run along the outer edges of the disc holder 1 (see Fig. 12). The last-mentioned alternative also affords the advantage that, when using a disc holder made of clear plastic, an additional advertising or information surface 20 which becomes visible when the CD is taken out is formed on the lower side of the package (cf. Fig. 1).<br>
The gluing surfaces 19 and 15 on the upper side of the disc holder 1 are formed by the strip-like surface 12 and the (as already mentioned) plane upper side of the folded-over closure portion 3 (see Fig. 13) . Gluing is done when the information disc is already fitted and when the closure portion 3 is folded over, but still materially connected to the disc holder 1, so that only after breaking the predetermined break points 17 due to bending of the closure portion 3 performed by the user relative to the disc holder 1, can the package be opened for the first time to remove the CD. Hence cheap sealing protection of the information disc inherent in manufacture is provided at the same time. In order to protect the CD additionally from falling out of the disc holder 1, the cover 2 can be glued to the front side of the disc holder, in each case as far as the outside diameter of the CD.<br>
Before gluing the cover 2 to the disc holder 1, a flat printing type can be laid between the CD and the lower side of the cover 2. The printing type can also be permanently connected to the lower side of the cover 2, especially as it is also made of paper.<br>
