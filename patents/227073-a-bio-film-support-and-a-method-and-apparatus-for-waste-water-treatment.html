DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Reference is now made to Figs. lA and IB, which are simplified illustrations of two types of prior art waste water treatment systems, which respectively employ surface aerators and diffused air aeration.<br>
As seen in Fig. lA, one conventional type of prior art waste water treatment system comprises a basin 10 having a waste water inlet 12 and a treated water outlet 14. A plurality of surface aerators 16 are disposed at the water level of water in basin 10 and are operative to aerate the water therein, thus promoting biological activity and biological decomposition of organic material therein.<br>
Another conventional type of prior art waste water treatment system is shown in Fig. IB and comprises a basin 20 which may be identical to basin 10 (Fig. 1), having a waste water inlet 22 and a treated water outlet 24. A plurality of air diffusers 26 are disposed at the bottom of basin 20 and are coupled by air conduits 28 to an air blower 30. Operation of blower 30 causes air to bubble upwardly through waste water in basin 20, thus promoting biological activity and biological decomposition of organic material therein.<br>
Reference is now made to Figs. 2 and 3, which are simplified illustrations of a waste water treatment system of the type of Fig. lA or Fig. IB in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention. The system of Figs. 2<br><br>
and 3 may or may not be a retrofit of an existing system. As shown in Figs. 2 and 3, it is a particular feature of the present invention that a series of air lifts are fitted into a conventional waste water treatment system including a basin 40 having a waste water inlet 42 and a treated water outlet 44.<br>
In accordance with a preferred embodiment of the invention, a series of air lifts 50 is arranged in multiple process stages, typically 4 - 12 in number. Each process stage includes an initial air lift assembly, here designated by reference numeral 52 and at least one intermediate air lift assembly, here designated by reference numeral 54. A final process stage preferably includes a final air lift assembly, here designated by reference numeral 56.<br>
Initial air lift assembly 52 preferably includes a upstream partition 60 which preferably extends downwardly from a top location above the water level 62 in basin 40 to a bottom location spaced from the bottom 66 of basin 40 and preferably extends fully from side to side of the basin 40. In the initial cur lift assen\bly 52, the upstream partition is attached to a deflector plate 68 which extends in a downstream direction from upstream partition 60 at a location preferably generally at the water level 62. The initial air lift assembly 52 preferably also includes a downstream partition 70 which also extends fully from side to side of the basin 40 but does not extend up to the water level 62 or as close to the bottom 66 as does partition 60.<br>
Each intermediate air lift assembly 54 preferably includes an upstream partition 80 which preferably extends downwardly  from a top location below the water level 62 in basin 40 to a bottom location spaced from the bottom 66 of basin 40 and preferably extends fully from side to side of the basin 40. In the intermediate air lift assembly 54, the upstream partition 80 is separated from a deflector plate 8S which extends in a downstream direction from upstream partition 80 at a location preferably generally at the water level 62. The intermediate air lift assembly 54 preferably also includes a dov^nstream partition 90 which also extends ftilly from side to side of the basin 40 but does not extend up to the water level 62 or as close to the bottom 66 as does partition 80. The top of downstream partition 90 is preferably at the same level as is the top of upstream partition SO.<br>
Final air lift assembly 56 preferably includes an upstream partition 100 which preferably extends downwardly from a top location below the water level 62 in<br><br>
basin 40 to a bottom location spaced from the bottom 66 of basin 40 and preferably extends fully from side to side of the basin 40. The final air lift assembly 56 preferably also includes a downstream partition 110 which also extends fully from side to side of the basin 40 and extends to a top location above the water level 62 and closer to the bottom 66 than does partition 110. In the final air lift assembly 56, the downstream partition 110 is attached to a deflector plate 1 IS which extends in an upstream direction from downstream partition 110 at a location preferably generally at the water level 62.<br>
It is noted that in the embodiment of Figs. 2 and 3 a first plurality of air diffusers 126 are disposed at the bottom of basin 40 intermediate the upstream and downstream partitions of each air lift assembly and a second plurality of air diffusers 128, typically lesser in number than the first plurality of air diffusers are disposed at the bottom of basin 40 intermediate adjacent air lift assemblies. All of the air diffusers are coupled by air conduits 130 to one or more air blowers 132.<br>
Reference is now made to Figs. 4 and 5, which are simplified illustrations of the embodiment of Figs. 2 and 3 showing water flows. As seen in Figs. 4 and 5, the relatively high density of air diffusers intermediate the upstream and downstream partitions of each air lift assembly causes water to flow upward between the upstream and downstream partitions of each air lift assembly, as indicated by arrows 140. The relatively lower density of air diffusers intermediate adjacent air lift assemblies allows water to flow downward.<br>
Due to the construction of the initial airlift assemblies 52, water flows only in a do\vnstream direction at the top of each initial airlift assembly 52, as indicated by arrows 142. Due to the different construction of the intermediate airlift assemblies' 54, water flows in both upstream and downstream directions, indicated by respective arrows 144 and 146, at the top of each intermediate airlift assembly 54. Due to the construction of the final airlift assembly 56, water flows only in an upstream direction, indicated by arrows 148, at the top the final airlift assembly 56.<br>
Reference is now made to Fig. 6, which is a sectional illustration corresponding to Fig. 3 and showing particles 150 preferably located in the embodiment of Fig. 2 in the absence of fluid flow. Particles 150 are preferably floating porous plastic particles having a density lower than that of pure water, preferably having a specific gravity between 0.65 and 0.95. Typically, the particles have an irregular shape, whose<br><br>
largest dimension is approximately 4 - 10 mm and preferably about 6 mm. Preferably the particles have a total porosity exceeding 50% and a preferred mean pore diameter of pores, whose diameter exceeds 10 microns, of about 20 microns.<br>
As seen in Fig. 6, preferably 10-40 percent cf the volume of the basin is filled with particles 150 in the absence of water flow.<br>
Reference is now made to Fig. 7, which is a sectional illustration corresponding to Fig. 6 and showing water flows and fluidization of particles thereby. It is seen in Fig. 7, that due to the water flows, typified in Figs. 4 and 5, the volume of the bed of particles 150 increases substantially, as the bed of particles is fluidized. The particles 150 are generally constrained to reside outside of the air lift assemblies, inasmuch as they generally do not pass underneath upstream partitions 60. When particles 150 become heavily coated with biomass, they do sometimes pass under downstream partitions 70 or 90 or upstream partition 100 and are sloughed of some of the biomass as they are propelled upwards by the action of the air lift.<br>
It is noted that in addition to the water flows indicated by arrows 142, 144, 146 and 148, there exists a continuous flow of water from the upstream side of the basin 40 from the waste water inlet 42 to the treated water outlet 44. This flow is an undulating flow.and includes passage under upstream partitions 60, SO and 100, as indicated by arrows 160. The passage under upstream partitions 60, SO and 100 is of relatively low volume and generally does not carry floating particles 150 into the air lifts, thereby constraining the particles 150 to reside outside of and between the air lift assemblies and preventing migration of particles across air lift assemblies.<br>
It is appreciated that the provision of first and second pluralities of air diffusers 126 and 128 enables control of flow velocity between adjacent air lifts while providing a high level of aeration to the water in basin 40,<br>
Reference is now made to Figs. 8A, SB, SC and SD, which are simplified illustrations of four embodiments of a unidirectional rectangular airlift used in the embodiment of Figs. 2-7.<br>
Fig. 8A illustrates a preferred initial air lift assembly 52, including upstream partition 60, deflector 68 and downstream partition 70 as well as first plurality of air diffusers 12S.<br>
Fig.   SB   illustrates   a  preferred  final  air lift  assembly  56   including<br><br><br>
Fig. 8C illustrates an alternative initial air lift assembly 252, including upstream panition 260, an adjustable angle deflector 26S and a downstream partition 270 as well as first plurality of air diffusers 328.<br>
Fig. SD illustrates an alternative final air lift assembly 356 including an integral curved downstream partition and deflector 358 and an upstream portion 360, as well as a first plurality of air diffusers 368. The curved design of the integral downstream partition and deflector reduces energy losses.<br>
It is appreciated that the adjustable configuration of Fig. 8C may be employed additionally or alternatively for a final air lift assembly and the integral configuration of Fig. 8D may be employed additionally or alternatively for an initial air lifl assembly.<br>
Reference is now made to Figs. 9A, 9B, 9C and 9D, which are simplified illustrations of four embodiments of a bidirectional rectangular airlift used in the embodiment of Figs. 2-7;<br>
Fig. 9 A illustrates a preferred intermediate air lift assembly 54, including upstream partition 80, deflector 88 and downstream partition 90 as well as first plurality of air diffusers 128.<br>
Fig. 9B illustrates an alternative intermediate air lift assembly 456 including upstream partition 480, fixed angle deflector 482 and downstream portion 490, as well as a first plurality of air diSusers 498.<br>
Fig. 9C illustrates a further alternative intermediate air lift assembly 556, including upstream partition 560, a two-way adjustable angle deflector 568 and a downstream partition 570 as well as first plurality of air diffusers 578. Fig. 9C shows the two-way adjustable angle deflector 568 in a flat orientation.<br>
Fig. 9D illustrates the intermediate air life assembly 556 of Fig. 9C in an alternative operative orientation wherein two-way adjustable angle deflector 568 is arranged to have an angled orientation, such as that shown in Fig. 9B.<br>
Reference is now made to Fig. 10, which is a simplified illustration of a denitrification unit useful in the embodiment of Figs. 2-7. De-nitrification units such as those shown in Fig. 10 may be'installed instead of all of the intermediate air lifts 54 in a<br><br>
given process stage.<br>
As seen in Fig. 10, a plurality of axial pumps 600 may provide lift without an air flow, as in the air lifts of Figs. 1 - 9, thereby to provide an anoxic de-nitrification process.<br>
Reference is now made to Figs. 11 and 12, which are simplified illustrations of a embodiment of a waste water treatment system of the type of Fig. lA or Fig. IB in accordance with another embodiment of the present invention.<br>
As shown in Figs. 11 and 12, it is a particular feature of the present invention that an array of air lifts are retrofitted into a conventional waste water treatment system including a basin 740 having a waste water inlet 742 and a treated water oudet 744.<br>
In accordance with a preferred embodiment of the invention, an array of cylindrical air lifts 750 is arranged in multiple process stages, typically 4 - 12 in number, which are separated from each other typically by partitions 752, which extend from a bottom location 754 spaced from the bottom 756 of basin 740 by a first vertical separation and extend upwardly to a top location 758 above the water level 760 in basin 740. Partitions 752 preferably extend fully from side to side of the basin 740. Each cylindrical air lift 750 typically comprises a hollow shaft-762 which extends from a bottom location 764 spaced from bottom 756 by a second vertical separation which exceeds the first separation.<br>
A deflector 768 is preferably disposed in spaced relationship over each hollow shaft 762 and is disposed at a location preferably at the water level 760.<br>
It is noted that in the embodiment of Figs. 11 and 12 an air difiuser 770 is preferably disposed underlying each hollow shaft 762 to provide an air lift therethrough. All of the air diffusers 770 are coupled by air conduits 772 to one or more air blowers 774.<br>
Immediately upstream of each partition 752 there is provided a series of air diffusers 776, which" are preferably coupled by air conduits 778 to one or more air blowers 774.<br>
Reference is now made to Fig. 13, which is a simplified illustration of the embodiment of Figs. 11 and 12 showing water flows. As seen in Fig. 13, the air diffusers 770 underlying the hollow shafts 762' cause water to flow into the hollow<br><br>
shafts 762, as indicated by arrows 780 and upwardly through the hollow shafts, as indicated by arrows 782. The presence of deflectors 768 overlying each hollow shaft 762 causes the water exiting the tops of hollow shafts 762 to move sideways and downwardly, as indicated by arrows 784. The absence or lower density of air difflisers outside of shafts 762 allows water to flow downwardly, as indicated by arrows 786.<br>
Reference is now made to Fig. 14, which is a sectional illustration corresponding to Fig. 12 and showing particles 850 preferably located in the embodiment of Fig. 11 in the absence of fluid flow. Particles 850 are preferably floating porous plastic particles having a density lower than that of pure water, preferably having a specific gravity between 0.65 and 0.95. Typically, the particles have an irregular shape, whose largest dimension is approximately 4 - IQ mm and prefeiably about 6 mm. Preferably the particles have a total porosity exceeding 50% and a preferred mean pore diameter of pores, whose diameter exceeds 10 microns, of about 20 microns.<br>
As seen m Fig. 14, preferably 10 - 40 percent of the volume of the basin is filled with particles 850 in the absence of water flow.<br>
Reference is now made to Fig. 15, which is a sectional illustration corresponding to Fig. 14 and showing water flows and fluidization of particles thereby. It is seen in Fig. 15, that due to the water flows, typified in Fig. 13, the volume of the bed of particles 850 increases substantially, as the bed of particles is fluidized. The particles 850 are generally constrained to reside outside of the hollow shafts 762, inasmuch as they generally do not reside as low in the basin 740 as the openings of shafts 762 at bottom locations 764 thereof<br>
When particles 850 become heavily coated with biomass, they do sometimes enter hollow shafts 762 and are sloughed of some of the biomass as they are propelled upwards by the action of the air lift provided thereby.<br>
It is noted that in addition to the water flows indicated by arrows 780, 782, 784 and 786, there exists a continuous flow of water fi-om the upstream side of the basin 740 fi'om the waste water inlet 742 to the treated water outlet 744. This flow is a partially undulating flow and includes passage under partitions 752, as indicated by arrows 860. The passage under partitions 752 is of relatively low volume and generally does not carry floating particles 850 into the air lifts, thereby constraining the particles S50 to reside outside of and between the air lifts and preventing migration of particles<br><br>
across partitions 752.<br>
It is appreciated that control of particle movement and prevention of particle migration may be assisted by ancillary air difRisers 870, disposed upstream of partitions 752. These air diffusers are connected via valves S72 and air conduits 772 to one or more air blowers 774.<br>
Reference is now made to Fig. 16, which is a simplified illustration of a denitrification unit useful in the embodiment of Figs. 11-15. De-nitrification units such as those shown in Fig. 16 may be installed instead of all of the air lifts 750 in a given process stage.<br>
As seen in Fig. 16, a plurality of axial pumps 900 may provide lift without an air flow, as in the air lifts of Figs. 11-15, thereby to provide an anoxic de-nitrification process.<br>
Reference is now made to Figs. 17A, 17B, 17C, 17D and 17E, which are simplified illustrations of examples of various embodiments of deflectors 768, useful in the embodiment of Fiss. 11-15.<br>
Fig. 17A shows a flat deflector 910, while Fig. 17B shows a curved deflector 912. Fig. 17 shows a conical deflector 914, while Fig. 17D shows a finned conical defleaor 916, having fins 918. Fig. I7E shows a pyramidal deflector 920.<br>

ISA and ISB, which are respective simplified pictorial and sectional illustrations of a biofilm suppon constructed and operative in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention. As seen in Figs. ISA and ISB, there is provided a biofilm support element 1010 formed of plastic, having a maximum dimension which does not exceed 50 mm and having a specific gravity of between approximately 0.70 - 0.91.<br>

In accordance with a preterred embodiment or the present invention, a transverse strip 1018 is provided along an outwardly facing edge of each rib 1016. Additional transverse strips may also be provided along each rib. In the embodiment of Figs. ISA and ISB, the width of each strip is preferably equal to approximately 15 - 60 percent, and more preferably equal to approximately 20 - 40 percent, of the overall circumference of the cylindrical biofilm support element 1010, divided by the number of ribs 1016.<br>
It is a particular feature of the present invention that the biofilm support element 1010 and specifically ribs 1016 and strips 1018 are configured so as to prevent retained interdigitation between ribs of two separate biofilm support elements. In the embodiment of Figs. ISA and 18B, interdigitation can occur, but upon such interdigitation, two separate biofilm support elements readily disengage. Accordingly, the biofilm support element 1010 of Figs. 18A and 18B is preferably configured so as to prevent mechanically retained joining of two separate biofilm support elements 1010.<br>
In accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention, biofilm support element 1010 is formed of a plastic material selected from the following plastic materials polyoletin. polystyrene, polyvinyl chloride and polyurethane.

Reference is now made to Figs. 19A and 19B, which are respective simplified pictorial and sectional illustrations of a biofilm support constructed and operative in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention. As seen in Figs. 19A and I9B, there is provided a biofilm support element 1020, similar to that of Figs. ISA and 18B, formed of plastic, having a maximum dimension which does not<br><br>
exceed 50 mm and having a specific gravity of between approximately 0.70 - 0.91.<br>
Preferably, and similarly to biofilm support element 1010 (Figs. ISA and 18B), biofum suppon element 1020 has a generally cylindrical configuration and includes a plurality of radially extending surfaces 1022 extending outwardly from a generally solid center 1024. In accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention, surfaces 1022 are integrally formed as one piece with the solid center 1024, preferably by extrusion, and define opposite side surfaces of a plurality of radially extending ribs 1026, preferably between five and nine in number. In accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention, each of ribs 1026 has a thickness of between 0.5 and 2 mm.<br>
In accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention, a transverse strip 1028 is provided along an outwardly facing edge of each rib 1026, Additional transverse strips may also be provided along each rib. In the embodiment of Figs. 19 A and \9E, the width of each strip is preferably equal to approximately 60-90 percent of the overall circumference of the cylindrical biofilm support element 1020, divided by the number of ribs 1026.<br>
It is a particular feature of the present invention that the biofilm support element 1020 and specifically ribs 1026 and strips 102S are configured so as to prevent interdigitation between ribs of two separate biofilm support elements. In the embodiment of Figs. 19A and 19B, interdigitation cannot occur. Accordingly, the biofilm support element 1020 of Figs. 19A and 19B is preferably configured so as to prevent mechanically retained joining of two separate biofilm support elements 1020.<br>
In accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention, similarly to biofilm support element 1010 (Figs 18A and I SB), biofilm support element 1020 is formed of a plastic material selected fi*om the following plastic materials: polyolefin, polystyrene, polyvinyl chloride and polyurethane. Polypropylene having a melt flow index typically in the range of 0.5 - 10 is the preferred material.<br>
In accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention, biofilm support element 1020 has a specific gravity of between approximately 0.75 -0.S9 and most preferably between approximately 0.81 - 0.S7.<br>
It is a particular feature of the invention that the surfaces 1022 of ribs 1026, as well as other exposed surfaces of biofilm support element 1020, are roughened.<br><br>
Preferably, some or all of the roughened biofum adherence surfaces have a roughness average (Ra) in the range of 100 - 800 microns and most preferably in the range of 200 -500 microns.<br>
Reference is now made to Fig. 20, which is a simplified illustration of a methodology for forming a bioftim support in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention. As seen in Fig. 20 an extruder 1030, which may be a conventional extruder, receives a mixture of materials, preferably including a plastic material 1032 selected from the following plastic materials: polyolefin, polystyrene, polyvinyl chloride and polyurethane.

Reference is now made to Figs. 21 and 22, which are simplified illustrations of a waste water treatment system and methodology employing a biofilm support in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention. As seen in Figs. 21 and 22, biofilm support element 1010 (Figs. ISA and 18B) or biofilm support element 1020 (Figs. 19A and 19B) may be advantageously employed in an air-lift type waste water treatment system and methodology. A preferred such system is described in applicants' co-pending U.S Patent Application 09/866,886, filed May 29, 2001, entitled "METHOD AND APP.AILATUS FOR BIOLOGICAL WASTEWATER TREATMENT", the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
As seen in Fig 21, an air-lift waste water treatment system and methodology' employs a pressurized air supply, typically including nozzles 1050, located near the floor of a basin 1052, which are supplied with pressurized air from a compressor (not shown) via pipes 1054. Waste water 1056 fills part of basin 1052, and a multiplicity of biofilm supports 1058, such as biofilm support element 1010 (Figs. ISA and I SB) or 1020 (Figs. 19A and I9B) described hereinabove, float at the top of the waste water 1056, as shown. Preferably, generally cylindrical upstanding air lift enclosures 1060 are provided overlying nozzles 1050.<br>
As seen in Fics. 21 and 22, the air-lift waste water treatment svstem and methodology employs pressurized air from nozzles 1050 to cause an upward flow of waste water 1056 through air lift enclosures 1060. This causes biofilm supports 1058 to be inversely fluidized in waste water 1056, thereby providing enhanced turbulence and mass transfer for efficient waste water treatment.<br>
Reference is now made to Figs. 23 and 24, which are simplified illustrations of a waste water treatment system of the type of Fig. lA or Fig. IB in accordance with another preferred embodiment of the present invention, which may or may not be a retrofit. As shown in Figs. 23 and 24, it is a particular feature of the<br><br>
present invention that a series of air lifts are fitted into a conventional waste water treatment system including a basin 1140 having a waste water inlet 1142 and a treated water outlet 1144.<br>
In accordance with a preferred embodiment of the invention, a series of air lift assemblies 1154 is arranged in multiple process stages, typically 4 - 12 in number. Each process stage includes at least one air lift assembly 1154. The process stages are separated by stage partition assemblies 1155, preferred embodiments of which are described hereinbelow with reference to Fiss. 29A and 29B.<br>
Each air lift assembly 1154 preferably includes an upstreami partition 1156 which preferably extends downwardly from a top location below the water level 1162 in basin 1140 to a bottom location spaced from the bottom 1166 of basin 1140 and preferably extends fuUy from side to side of the basin 1140. The air lift assembly 1154 preferably also includes a downstream partition 1168, which preferably also extends ftilly from side to side of the basin 1140 and extends below the water level 1162 and as close to the bottom 1166 as does partition 1154. The top of downstream partition 1168 is preferably at the same level as is the top of upstream partition 1154. Alternatively, some or all of partitions 1156 and 116S need not extend fully from side to side of the basin 1140.<br>
It is noted that in the embodiment of Figs. 23 and 24 a first plurality of air diffusers 1226 are disposed at the bottom of basin 1140 intermediate the upstream and downstream partirions 1156 and 1168 of each air lift assembly and a second plurality of air diffusers 1228, typically greater in number than the first plurality of air diffusers are disposed at the bottom of basin 1140 intermediate pairs of adjacent air lift assemblies 1154 and intermediate air lift assemblies 1154 and stage partition assemblies 1155. All of the air difftisers 1226 and 1228 are coupled by air conduits 1230 to one or more air blowers 1232.<br>
Reference is now made to Figs. 25 and 26, which are simplified illustrations of the embodiment of Figs. 23 and 24 showing water flows. As seen in Figs. 25 and 26, the relatively high density of air diffusers intermediate pairs of adjacent air lift assemblies 1154 and intermediate air lift assemblies 1154 and stage partition assemblies 1155 causes water to flow upward between intermediate pairs of adjacent air lift  assemblies  1154  and intermediate air lift assemblies  1154  and stage partition<br><br>
assemblies 1155, as indicated by arrows 1240. The relatively lower density ot" air difRjsers intermediate the upstream and downstream partitions of each air lift assembly allows water to flow downward as indicated by arrows 1242.<br>
Due to the construction of the airlift assemblies 1154, water flows in both upstream and downstream directions, indicated by respective arrows 1244 and 1246, at the top of each airlift assembly 1154.<br>
Reference is now made to Fig. 27, which is a sectional illustration corresponding to Fig. 24 and showing particles 1250 preferably located in the embodiment of Fig. 23 in the absence of fluid flow. Particles 1250 are preferably floating biomass support elements having a density lower than that of pure water, preferably having a specific gravity between 0.7 and 0.91. Typically, the biomass support elements have a generally cylindrical configuration and include a plurality of radially extending surfaces. Preferred particles 1250 are described hereinabove with reference to Figs. 18A- 19B.<br>
As seen in Fig. 27, preferably 10-40 percent of the volume of the basin is filled with particles 1250 in the absence of water flow.<br>
Reference is now made to Fig. 28, which is a sectional illustration corresponding to Fig. 27 and showing water flows and fluidization of particles thereby. It is seen in Fig. 28, that due to the water flows, typified in Figs. 25 and 26, the volume of the bed of particles 1250 increases substantially, as the bed of particles is fluidized.<br>
It is noted that in addition to the water flows indicated by arrows 1240, 1242, 1244 and 1246, there exists a continuous flow of water ft-om the upstream side of the basin 1140 from the waste water inlet 1142 to the treated water outlet 1144. This - -flow is an undulating flow and includes passage under stage partition assemblies 1155, as indicated by arrows 1260. The passage under stage partition assemblies 1155 is of relatively low volume and generally does not carry floating particles 1250 across the stage partifion assemblies 1155, thereby constraining the particles 1250 of each stage to reside within that stage and preventing migration of particles across stage partition assemblies 1155.<br>
It is appreciated that the provision of first and second pluralities of air difftjsers 1226 and 1228 enables control of flow velocity between adjacent air lifts while providing a high level of aeration to the water in basin 1140. The first plurality of air<br><br>
diffusers 1226 is of principal importance during sran up of operation of the system.<br>
Reference is now made to Figs. 29A and 29B, which are simplified illustrations of two embodiments of a stage partition assembly including a carrier barrier employed in the embodiment of Figs. 23 - 28.<br>

Panels 1294 and 1296 preferably are each inclined with respect to partition 1272 and are mutually angled by 90 - 120 degrees. Similarly, panels 1298 and 1300 preferably are each inclined with respect to partition 1272 and are mutually angled by 90 - 120 degrees.<br>
In accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention, partition 1272 is spaced from each of partitions 1278 and 1280 by a distance which is selected such that the water flow velocity therethrough is significantly lower than the free rise velocity of the biomass support elements 1250, in water. Preferably, the flow velocity of water between partition 1272 and partitions 1278 and 1280 is less than one-half of the free rise velocity of the biomass support elements 1250. Determination of the separation distance of the partitions 1278 and 1280 for a given flow velocity made be readily made from the graph presented in Fig. 30, for different water flow rates.<br>
The stage panition assembly 1270 preferably is operable to allow water flow therethrough, as indicated by arrows 1302,    1304, 1306,  1308 and 1310, while<br><br>
generally prevenang me passage therethrough or biomass suppon elemenis HDU.<br>
Fig. 29B illustrates an alternative embodiment of a stage partition assembly 1320 which is similar to assembly 1270 other than in that panels 1294 and 129S are eliminated. The operation of assembly 1320 is substantially similar to that of assembly 1270.<br>

In accordance with a preferred embodiment of the invention, a series of air lift assemblies 2154 is arranged in multiple process stages, typically 4 - 12 in number. Each process stage includes at least one air lift assembly 2154.

All of the air ditftisers are coupled by air conduits 2230 to one or more air blowers 2232.<br>
Reference is now made to Figs. 33 and 34, which are simplified illustrations of the embodiment of Fiss. 31 and 32 showins water flows. As seen in Figs. 33 and 34, the relatively high density of air diffusers 2228 intermediate pairs of adjacent air lift assemblies 2154 and intermediate air lift assemblies 2154 and stage partition assemblies 2155 causes water to flow upward between intermediate pairs of adjacent air lift assemblies 2154 and intermediate air lift assemblies 2154 and stage partition assemblies 2155, as indicated by arrows 2240. The relatively lower density of air diffusers intermediate the upstream and downstream partitions of each air lift _ assembly allows water to flow downward as indicated by arrows 2242.<br><br>
Due to the locations of the airlift assemblies 2154, water flows in both upstream and downstream directions, indicated by respective arrows 2244 and 2246, at the top of each airlift assembly 2154.<br>

It is noted that in addition to the water flows indicated by arrows 2240, 2242, 2244 and 2246, there exists a continuous flow of water from the upstream side of the basin 2140 from the waste water inlet 2142 to the treated water outlet 2144.
