				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to an electronic mailbox address book sharing<br>
system and a method for the same and, more particularly, to an address book<br>
sharing system and a method for sharing an address book with other computers.<br>
2.	Description of Related Art<br>
Along with the development of the Internet, transmission of network<br>
information is substantially replacing transmission of conventional written<br>
documents. Among the transmission techniques of network information, E-mail<br>
is the most popular, and is widely used by various companies, families and<br>
individuals. The reason why E-mail is much appreciated is that it can provide<br>
convenient, quick and borderless communication. The contents can include<br>
multimedia information and can be transmitted to a large number of receivers.<br>
These advantages make E-mail an indispensable transmission medium in the<br>
information era.<br>
For address books used in existent electronic mailboxes such as Outlook<br>
Express from Microsoft Inc., a computer user is allowed to build his own<br>
address book and also allowed to arbitrarily add, delete or modify the contents<br>
and data of this address book. For a company, however, the data of address<br>
books in computers of its employees are very important, because the address<br>
books can record private mailing lists of the employees and also mailing lists of<br>
important customers of the company. The safety of the mailing lists of these<br>
important customers is in doubt, because anyone can add to, delete from, or<br><br>
otherwise modify the mailing lists. In particular, when an employee leaves a<br>
company, he can easily delete the mailing lists of important customers of the<br>
company in the address book, hence causing the company much trouble.<br>
Besides, the address book in each computer is separately accessed but cannot<br>
be shared with other computers.<br>
Difference is given to Yahoo Messenger, that is available as free ware in the<br>
internet social network service run by Goggle launched on 22.01.2004.<br>
Yahoo Messenger's share your function taken directly from Yahoo<br>
Messenger feature page (http://.yahoo.com/feat_fas.php) "From the Actions<br>
menu in the messenger list, select Send My Messenger List. Choose a frient,<br>
and then select which contacts you want to share. When your friend accepts, he<br>
or she can essily send Add requests to the people you shared.<br>
It should be noted, that once Yahoo Messenger has shared a Messenger List<br>
A to Messenger List B, the two messenger list would remain separate. When<br>
List A Modify or Deleter its list after the sharing, List B woul be none the wiser,<br>
the two list remains separate, which is in opposite spirit ofr the present patent's<br>
"Public Address Book" function.<br>
For the present invention, when the Public Address Book is modified or<br>
changed, both Person A and Person B would see the same change and able to<br>
benefit with the change. For example, a client company has changed its legal<br>
name, so Person A with "Edit Access" made the changes in the Public Address<br>
Book to update and reflect the legal name change, now Person B would also<br>
have access to that changed Public Address Book. Whereas in Yahoo<br>
Messenger, a change in List A would not affect a change in List B, since they<br><br>
are two separate list; wherein the two separate list could be argued to be similar<br>
to the present patent's private mailing list due to them sharing similar quality of<br>
separation (2 separate database)-however, the present patent does not advocate<br>
the sharing of the private mailing list, in fact, the creation of a secondary list<br>
(the private mailing list) on top of the public sharing address, is to prevent the<br>
sharing on sensitive information.<br>
Therefore, neither the public address book database function acts like Yahoo<br>
Messengers's "share messenger list"function, nor does the private address book<br>
database function acts like Yahoo messenmger's "share messenger list' function<br>
(because private address book database does not share).<br>
Now regarding Orkut, with descriptions taken directly from Orkut homepage<br>
(http://www.orkut.com/About.aspx):<br>
"Orkut is a online community designed to make your social life more active<br>
and stimulating. Orkut's social network can help you maintain existing<br>
relationships with pictures and messages, and establish new ones by reaching<br>
out to people you've never met before.<br>
Orkut makes it easy to find people who share your hobbies and interests,<br>
look for romantic connections or establish new business contacts. You can also<br>
create and join a wide variety of online communities to discuss current events,<br>
reconnect with old school mates or even exchange your favorite recipes."<br>
Orkut creates communities, and within the community, a user can find<br>
contacts. However, no user may Modify or Delete other people's profile. Each<br>
profile and contact is once again individually maintained, just like Yahoo<br>
Messenger. Furthermore, Orkut has no contact sharing function. The user must<br><br>
search for the new contact (community) if he or she so desires.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide an electronic mailbox<br>
address book sharing system and a method for the same so that mailing lists<br>
recorded in an address book can be shared with other computers. This<br>
address book can provide determination of access permissions to enhance the<br>
safety of data stored therein.<br>
To achieve the above object, the present invention provides an electronic<br>
mailbox address book sharing system, which comprises an electronic mail<br>
server and a plurality of client computers. The electronic mail server has an<br>
address book. These client computers log into the electronic mail server via a<br>
network. The electronic mail server provides access to and use of the address<br>
book to these client computers.<br>
The present invention also provides an electronic mailbox address book<br>
sharing method, which comprises the steps of: providing an electronic mail<br>
server with an address book; providing a plurality of client computers that log<br>
into the electronic mail server via a network; and using the electronic mail<br>
server to provide access to and use of the address book to the client computers<br>
when the client computers log into the electronic mail server.<br>
By using the electronic mailbox address book sharing system and the<br>
method for the same, the address book can be stored in the electronic mail<br>
server, and the client computers can log into the electronic mail server to read<br>
the address book, thereby sharing the data of the address book.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
The internal mail management of a company is usually accomplished by<br>
using an electronic mail server to send and receive mail. The address book of<br>
customer name lists is usually stored in each client computer. The address book<br>
cannot be shared, and is difficult to manage. In consideration of the above<br>
factors, the present invention builds the address book in an electronic mail<br>
server for overall planning and management.<br>
As shown in Fig. 1, the present invention provides an electronic mailbox<br>
address book sharing system, which is established on a client/server<br>
architecture platform. In this embodiment, an electronic mail server 10 (a first<br><br>
electronic mail server) and a plurality of client computers 21 are provided in<br>
the head office. The client computers 21 can send, receive, and manage mail<br>
with the electronic mail server 10 via a network 20. Client computers (not<br>
shown) of other branch companies 33 can also send, receive, and manage mail<br>
with the electronic mail server 10 via a network 30. In this embodiment, in<br>
addition sending and receiving mail, the electronic mail server 10 also allows<br>
address book sharing. In this embodiment, the network 20 is an intranet, while<br>
the network 30 belongs to the Internet. An electronic mail server 31 (a second<br>
electronic mail server) can also be provided between a branch company 33 and<br>
the network 30 so that the branch company 33 is connected to the electronic<br>
mail server 31. The electronic mail server 31 primarily provides sending and<br>
receiving of electronic mail messages, but does not provide address book<br>
sharing. Tn this embodiment, the branch companies 33 can also be taken as a<br>
plurality of client groups composed of client computers.<br>
In this embodiment, the electronic mail server 10 is an Internet protocol mail<br>
server. When the present invention is used, each client computer 21 can log<br>
into the electronic mail server 10 via the network 20, and address data stored in<br>
the electronic mail server 10 can be shared with each client computer 21. The<br>
client computers in the branch companies 33 can also log into the electronic<br>
mail server 10 via the network 30, and address data stored in the electronic<br>
mail server 10 can be shared with the client computers of the branch companies<br>
33.<br>
In this embodiment, the electronic mail server 10 has a permission granting<br>
module 11, a full-text search module 13 and an address book 15. The address<br><br>
book 15 further includes a public address book database 151 and a plurality of<br>
private address book database 153. The public address book database 151<br>
stores shared mailing lists of public address book data that can be read by each<br>
client computer 21 and the client computers of the branch companies. The<br>
private address book database 153 stores private mailing lists of private address<br>
book data. Each client computer or each client computer of the branch<br>
companies corresponds to a private address book database 153, and each client<br>
computer has its own exclusive private address book.<br>
The permission granting module 11 can grant client computers permission to<br>
access data stored in the public address book database 151 and the private<br>
address book database 153 in the address book 15. Different levels of access<br>
include reading access, adding access, modifying access and/or deleting access.<br>
The permission granting module 11 identifies a client computer through the<br>
name of the client computer. When the permission granting module 11<br>
performs content setting, the electronic mail server 10 asks the logging-in client<br>
computer to input a password. The client computer can access the contents of<br>
the permission granting module 11 only if the input password is correct. In this<br>
embodiment, each client computer is set to have reading access and adding<br>
access to the public address book database 151 to achieve address book sharing.<br>
The permission granting module 11 sets each private address book database<br>
153 to correspond to a client computer, which has reading access and adding<br>
access to the private address book database 153 and can store private address<br>
book data into the private address book database 153. The permission granting<br>
module 11 can also make all access to the address book 15 open to specific<br><br>
client computers for maintenance and management of data stored in the public<br>
address book database 151 and the private address book databases 153.<br>
On the other hand, when there is a great deal of address data stored in the<br>
address book 15, searching for address data in one list after another takes a lot<br>
of time. The full-text search module 13 allows the user to set search conditions<br>
for finding matched data in the public address book database 151.<br>
Fig. 2 shows a flowchart for sharing an address book according to a<br>
preferred embodiment of the present invention. The flowchart comprises the<br>
following steps. First, a client computer logs into the electronic mail server 10<br>
(Step S201). Next, the electronic mail server 10 identifies the logging-in client<br>
computer (Step S203). The electronic mail server 10 uses the name of the client<br>
computer to identify the client computer. After the electronic mail server 10<br>
identifies the client computer, access to the address book is granted to the<br>
logging-in computer according to the set content of the permission granting<br>
module 11 (Step S205). In this embodiment, the client computer logging into<br>
the electronic mail server 10 can read and add to data stored in the public<br>
address book database 151. Similarly, the client computer can read and add to<br>
data stored in its corresponding private address book database 153.<br>
Fig. 3 shows an address book sharing frame displayed on a client computer<br>
of the present invention. The address book sharing frame includes a public<br>
address book display window 41, a private address book display window 42<br>
and a mailing list display window 43. The public address book display window<br>
41 is used to display data of the public address book database 151 in the<br>
electronic mail server 10. When a client computer logs into the electronic mail<br><br>
server 10, the public address book display window 41 will display data of the<br>
public address book database 151. Whether the client computer can read, add to,<br>
modify or delete data in the public address book database 151 is determined by<br>
the permission granting module 11. The public address book display window<br>
41 classifies mailing lists in groups (but is not limited in this way) for quick<br>
searches of public mailing lists. The public address book display window 41<br>
also provides a full-text search option 411 and a permission setting option 412.<br>
The private address book display window 42 is used to display data of a private<br>
address book database 153 in the electronic mail server 10 corresponding to the<br>
client computer. The private address book display window 42 also classifies<br>
mailing lists in groups (but is not limited in this way). The mailing list display<br>
window 43 displays all mailing lists in a group selected by the public address<br>
book display window 41 or the private address book display window 42.<br>
When the permission setting option 412 is selected for execution, the client<br>
computer is asked to input a password for the electronic mail server 10 to<br>
determine whether the user of the client computer has permission to change the<br>
set content of the permission granting module 11. If the input password is<br>
correct, the frame of Fig. 4 will be displayed. This frame includes a public<br>
address book edit window 44, a private address book edit window 45 and a<br>
permission setting edit window 46. Both the public address book edit window<br>
44 and the private address book edit window 45 provide function options of<br>
Add, Change Name, and Delete used to edit the group data displayed in the<br>
public address book edit window 44 and the private address book edit window<br>
45. The permission setting edit window 46 is used to edit reading, adding,<br><br>
modification, and deleting access of the client computer to data stored in the<br>
address book 15. For instance, if an adding option 413 in the permission setting<br>
edit window 46 is selected, the frame of Fig. 5 will be displayed. Of course,<br>
before selecting the adding option 413, the user needs to first select a group or<br>
a branch group in a group of the public address book edit window 44 or the<br>
private address book edit window 45. In a subject field 414, a client computer<br>
or a group (composed of a plurality of client computers) can be selected. A<br>
reading access field 415, a modifying access field 417, and a deleting access<br>
field 418 provide function options of Own, All, and None. An adding access<br>
field 416 provides function options of Allowed and Disallowed.<br>
In Fig. 3, when the full-text search option 411 is selected, the frame of Fig. 6<br>
will be displayed, in which several search fields are provided. The user can<br>
input keywords in different search fields to find put demanded mailing lists in<br>
the address book 15.<br>
To sum up, the present invention provides an electronic mailbox address<br>
book sharing system and a method for the same. Public and private mailing<br>
lists in address data are stored in the electronic mail server 10. Every client<br>
computer can log into the electronic mail server 10 for access (e.g., reading,<br>
adding, modifying and deleting) to address data, hence accomplishing address<br>
book sharing. Besides, in order to ensure the safety and integrity of data stored<br>
in the address book 15 in the electronic mail server 10, not every client<br>
computer can read or edit data in the address book 15 in the electronic mail<br>
server 10. Instead, the permission granting module 11 is used to provide a<br>
decision mechanism. Only the client computers having permission can read or<br><br>
edit address data stored in the address book 15 in the electronic mail server 10.<br>
Although the present invention has been described with reference to the<br>
preferred embodiment thereof, it will be understood that the invention is not<br>
limited to the details thereof. Various substitutions and modifications have been<br>
suggested in the foregoing description, and other will occur to those of ordinary<br>
