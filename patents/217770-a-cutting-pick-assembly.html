				<td>Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates a cutting pick assembly in coal mining and in particular to cutting picks for use in coal and rock excavation.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Coal and rock excavation is typically carried out using an array of picks deployed at intervals on a continuous miner or a shearer having a rotating cutting drum. The picks cut the coal face as they come into contact with it during rotation of the drum.<br>
Most currently available picks have a conical tool shape with a pointed tool tip. Conical picks do not actually cut, but rather crush the coal face, resulting in low coarseness of the product and the generation of a large amount of airborne dust particles. In fact, the resultant action generates dust and small fragments (fines) which require the use of continuous water sprays to meet Occupational Health and Safety conditions. These fine dust particles are a common health hazard to underground miners. As the particle size may fall into the carcinogenic and/or respiratory hazard ranges, miners subject to prolonged exposure can become susceptible to lung cancer, chronic bronchitis and pneumoconiosis. The large volumes of dust generated can also have an adverse effect on equipment reliability, resulting in increased equipment maintenance costs.<br>
The conical picks are only loosely held in their respective holders so they are free to rotate about their longitudinal axis. Studies showed that these picks do indeed fail after locking up in their holders due to fine dust generation and therefore rotation was prevented. This action splinters the coal and rock, generating fines and frictional ignition.<br>
Australian Patent Application No. 12672/97 published on 4 September 1997, which is incorporated herein by reference, partially addresses these issues. However, the picks disclosed in this document are mounted to the drum with the shank of the pick extending radially from the drum. This causes the pick to be subject to large shear forces as the pick contacts the cutting<br>
surface.<br>
The above statements regarding prior disclosures are not to be taken to be admissions of what was well known in the field of coal mining.<br>
Object of the Invention<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide an optimum cutting edge orientation to reduce the generation of air borne dust particles during cutting operations.<br>
Summarv of the Invention<br>
Accordingly, in a first aspect, the present invention provides a cutting pick assembly for mounting on a rotatable drum, said drum having a longitudinal axis of rotation, said pick assembly comprising a pick holder and a pick, said pick having, a non rotating cutting head having a straight cutting edge which delimits substantially planar front and trailing faces of said head;,<br>
a securing end adapted to engage said pick holder and secure said pick relative to said drum so that in use, rotation of said drum drives said cutting edge in a generally circular path and so that said pick is prevented from moving substantially relative to said drum; and a shank extending along an axis of extension between said cutting head and said securing end, said pick assembly being oriented such that said trailing face is inclined at an acute back clearance angle of about 7 to 15 degrees to a cutting plane, which is defined by a tangent to said circular path at said cutting edge, said front face is inclined at an acute front rake angle of about 10 to 45 degrees to an axis perpendicular to said cutting plane such that said front and trailing faces define an acute angle at said cutting edge, and said cutting edge is maintained in a fixed orientation relative to said drum and substantially parallel to said longitudinal axis; characterised in that both said front and trailing faces converge outwardly with respect to said drum toward said axis of extension and, when said pick and said pick holder are assembled, said shank extends at an acute angle to a radius of said circular path and is inclined from the radius toward the direction of rotation of the<br>

Detailed Description of the Preferred Embodiments<br>
Referring to the Figures there is disclosed a cutting pick 1 having a cutting head 2, shank 3 and securing (inner) end 4 adapted to attach the cutting pick 1 to a pick holder 11. In Figures 1 to 10, pick holder 11 is welded to the spiral vane 9 which likewise is welded to a rotating drum 10. In these figures, the securing end 4 is of a "T" shaped configuration, adapted to be slidably engaged and fastened in the channel of a pick holder 11 located on the spiral vane 9 of the rotating drum 10. The drum can be for a shearer or a continuous miner.<br>
The whole body of the cutting pick 1 is preferably made of an homogenous, unattached bar of steel alloy, fabricated from low alloy steel 4340, air hardened and tempered to about 60 HR'C<br>
Rockwell surface hardness. Picks in Figures 11A,B, 12A,B, 15A,B and 16A,B are designed to preferably cut coal, whilst picks in Figures 13A,B and 14A,B are designed for cutting hard rocks.<br>
The pick 1 includes a radially inner end 4 and a shank 3 to be fixed to the drum 10 to substantially prevent relative movement between the pick 1 and drum 10. The pick 1 further includes a cutting head 2 having leading and trailing faces 5,6 intersecting to provide a cutting edge 8 to extend generally parallel to an axis. The leading face 5 in use is inclined by an acute rake angle R to a radius of the axis, with the trailing face 6 being inclined at an acute back clearance angle B to a plane passing through the edge 8 and normal to the radius. The leading face 5 and trailing face 6 being inclined by an acute angle and the shank 3 when fixed to the drum 10 extend at an acute angle to the radius.<br>
As best seen in Figure 17, the front face 5 is inclined at a front rake angle R to an axis perpendicular to the cutting plane CP. Figure llA shows a front rake angle R of 30 degrees, whilst Figure 12A shows a front rake angle R of 10 degrees, for example.<br>
The width W of the cutting head 2, corresponding to the length of the cutting edge 8 is selected depending upon the material to be cut and the location of the cutting pick 1 on the rotating drum 10. Narrower cutting heads 2 (for example, Figure 13B) being used for cutting harder rock faces such as granite. Figures 1 IB, 12B, 13B, 14B, 15B and 16B show cutting picks 1 and cutting heads 2 having widths W of 30, 30, 10, 10, 50 and 50 mm respectively.<br>
As shown in Figure 18, the inner end 4 and shank 3 are adapted for engagement with a holder 11. The engagement is such that rotation of the drum 10 drives the cutting pick 1 in a circular path with a tangent of the path at the cutting edge 8 defining the cutting plane CP. The securing end arrangement allows for simple replacement of worn cutting picks 1. Other similar means of attachment may be employed at the securing end 4 which will rigidly fix the cutting pick 1 to the rotating drum 10 whilst allowing pick Ito be replaced.<br>
As shown in Figure 7, in use, a plurality of the cutting picks 1 are arranged on a spiral vane 9 on the rotating drum 10 attached to a shearer 14. The arrangement preferably being such that a<br>
series of cutting picks 1 follow the same path with adjacent cutting picks 1 being spaced such that they interact in the cutting operation, with each cutting pick 1 being relieved by the preceding cutting pick 1 in what is known as "relieved cutting". For improved cutting performance, the successive cutting picks 1 are spaced at a ratio relative to the depth of cut of S/D between 1 and 3, as shown in Figure 7 which defines the spacing S and Figure 10 which defines the depth of cut D as the distance the rotating drum 10 is advanced in one revolution.<br>
Further, cutting picks 1 may be arranged in a similar lacing pattern on the clearance (Face) ring 12 on the rotating drum 10.<br>
Use of the cutting picks at least described herein, allows advantageous pick performance characteristics, such as: reduction in dust generation due to unchanged rake angle (remains positive) and sharpness of the tip is maintained (self sharpen); lower and more consistent cutting power; decrease coal fragmentation (coarse coal produced); reduced water consumption; reduced wear and tear on cutting machine down-time; less friction between the pick surface and the cutting material thus reducing in frictional sparking; and enhanced health and safety of the mine environment. Use of the cutting picks 1 as described, allows an improved cutting operation for rock and coal faces 13, producing a coarser product with less airborne dust particles, thereby reducing the health risk to underground miners. The cutting pick 1 configuration is also more efficient in the cutting operation, requiring a lower cutting force and less specific energy to excavate a coal face when compared to the prior art.<br>
Although the invention has been described with reference to specific examples, it would be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the invention may be embodied in many other forms.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
