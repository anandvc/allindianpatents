[Field of the Invention]<br>
The present invention relates to a mobile agent technique and in particular to a method for moving, transmitting, and acquiring messages, agents and agent list including Computer.<br>
[0002]<br>
[Background Art]<br>
A mobile agent is. an agent that moves between computers;. and conventionally it moves directly from a source computer to a destination computer. Specifically, when a destination computer is designated. a mobile agent tends to move to the designated destination computer, regardless of the condition of that computer.<br>
[0003 1<br>
According to the conventional method, an agent can not move to a destination computer when it is not connected to a network, because of a maintenance check, or when the computer is not active, resulting in an error. When the computer is connected to a network, such as the Internet, a countermcasure for "the prevention of inappropriate external accesses, such  as the employment of  a firewall.<br>
is frequently provided. In such a case, since the mobile agent that attempts to access the computer is outside the firewall, the mobile agent can not reach the target computer over the firewall.  This case also results in an<br>
error.<br>
[0004]<br>
The above events can also occur when a mobile agent that is active in a specific computer transmits a message to a mobile agent that is active in another computer.<br>
[0005]<br>
There is a case where a user of a computer that is the destination of a mobile agent seeks to limit the mobile agents that are active in the user's computer to suitable ones. In addition, although a destination computer may accept any mobile agent, it is desirable that only a limited number of mobile agents are active in a computer at one time (or for a specific time) . In the above cases, if the only method for directly moving a mobile agent from a source computer to a destination computer is available, it may be inconvenient for the destination computer and the mobile agent.<br>
[00O6]<br>
[Problems to be Solved by the Invention]<br>
To resolve the above shortcomings, it is one object of the present invention to permit the movement of a mobile agent to a destination computer, regardless of the condition of the destination computer.<br>
[0007]<br>
It is another object of the present invention to provide a mechanism that enable the reception of the mobile agent in accordance with the circumstances of a destination computer.<br>
 [0008]<br>
It is an additional object of the present invention to perform the above operation for a message issued by a mobile agent.<br>
[0009]<br>
[Summary of the Present Invention]<br>
According to the present invention, a temporary storage area (a computer having a storage device) for a destination computer of a mobile agent and a message is provided. When a mobile agent or a message can not move directly to a destination computer, the mobile agent and the message are temporarily stored in the temporary storage area. At an appropriate time, the destination computer extracts from the temporary storage area the agent and the message addressed to it. Since the temporary storage area is provided, the movement of the agent and the transmission of the message are ensured. Also because the temporary storage device is provided, the destination computer can accept a mobile agent and a message in accordance with the situation and the condition of the destination computer.<br>
[0010]<br>
An explanation will be given for the operations performed by a destination computer, a source computer and a temporary storage computer. A method performed by a first computer, which is a source, to move an agent from the first computer comprises the steps of: converting the agent into a bit sequence for transmission of the agent; checking whether a second computer which is a destination of the agent can receive the bit sequence; and transmitting an address of the second computer and the bit sequence to the temporary storage computer when it is determined that the second computer cannot receive. When the agent can not move directly to the destination, in principle, the temporary storage  computer is employed.<br>
When it is determined that the second computer can receive the bit sequence, an address of the second computer and the bit sequence are transmitted to the second computer.<br>
[OOll]<br>
The step of checking whether the second computer can receive the bit sequence can be performed by transmitting to the second computer a movement confirmation request, including an address of the first computer, and by determining whether an acknowledgement response or a rejection response for the movement confirmation request is received from the second computer. The step can be performed by checking whether the transmission of a movement confirmation request is successfully completed or not.<br>
[0012]<br>
A method performed by a second computer, which is a destination, for moving an agent from a first computer, which is a source computer, comprises the steps of: determining whether the second computer can receive an agent in response to receiving an agent reception request from the first computer; transmitting a response representing receptibility to the first computer when the second computer can receive the agent; receiving a bit sequence for- transmission of the agent fron the first computer; and converting the bit sequence to generate an agent having a form executable in the second computer. When the second computer cannot receive, a response not representing receptibility may be transmitted.<br>
[0013]<br>
The above described method can be deployed for a message issued by a mobile agent. However, the second computer converts a bit eequence for the transmission of a message into a form interpretable for  an agent being executed  in<br>
the  second computer, and  transmits the converted message to the agent.<br>
[0014]<br>
When the first computer, which is the source computer, transmits a bit sequence for the transmission of an agent to the temporary storage computer for the second computer, which is the destination computer, the temporary storage computer performs the following process. The temporary storage computer receives a bit sequence for transmission of an agent and an address of a destination computer of the agent, and checks the address of the destination computer. When the address is of the second computer, the bit sequence is stored in a region for the second computer in the temporary storage computer.<br>
10015]<br>
As the storage method, the bit sequence can be held as a file, or can be stored in a database in the temporary storage computer.<br>
[0016]<br>
The processing performed by the temporary storage computer can be employed to store a bit sequence for the transmission of a message.<br>
[0017]<br>
However, since the message is to be transmitted to a specific agent, an identifier of a destination agent is checked in the bit sequence for the transmission of the message, and the bit sequence for the transmission of tiie message may be stored in a region for the second computer in the temporary storage computer so as to correspond to the destination agent of the message.<br>
[0018]<br>
To transmit the stored agent to a destination computer, the temporary storage computer performs the steps of: receiving an agent acquisition request that includes an address of a requesting source from the destination computer; checking the address of the requesting source in the agent acquisition request; checking a region for the destination computer in the temporary storage computer when the address of the requesting source is an address of the destination computer; taking out a bit sequence for an agent stored in the region for the destination computer; and transmitting the taken bit sequence for the agent to the destination computer.<br>
[0019]<br>
At this time, the checking step may include a step of adding a mark to the bit sequence for the agent when the bit sequence for the agent is present in the region for the destination computer.<br>
[0020]<br>
In addition, the temporary storage computer may perform a step of receiving an acknowledgement of an agent from the destination computer, and a step of deleting, in response to the reception of the acknowledgement, the bit sequence for the agent with the mark from the region for the destination computer in the temporary storage computer.<br>
[0021]<br>
Further, the temporary storage computer may perform a step of receiving the acknowledgement of an agent from the destination computer, and a step of storing, in response to the reception of the acknowledgement, the bit sequence for the agent with the mark separately from a bit sequence without the mark.<br>
[0022]<br>
The  above  described method,  performed by  the temporary<br>
storage computer for transmission of a stored agent to a destination computer is also performed for transmission of message.<br>
10023]<br>
The process performed when a destination computer acquires from a temporary storage computer a bit sequence for an agent comprises the steps of: transmitting an agent acquisition request to the temporary storage computer; receiving the bit sequence for transmission of the agent from the temporary storage computer; and converting the received bit sequence for the agent into a form executable by the computer. This process is also performed to acquire a message. In this case, a process is required for checking a destination agent of an acquired message and for transmitting the message to the de s11nati on agent.<br>
[0024]<br>
In addition,  a  method  for  acquiring  an  agent  and  a<br>
message  at  the same  time can  be  employed.   With this<br>
method, when a bit sequence for  an agent or for a message<br>
is present  in a region for a destination computer, a mark<br>
is  added to  the bit  sequence for the  agent or  for the<br>
message.<br>
[0025]<br>
Further, it is also possible to instruct a destination computer to acquire from a temporary storage computer a list of agents addressed to the destination computer, and either to select and acquire a specific agent on the list, or to select and delete a specific agent on the list. Such a list can also be employed for messages; however, since a message transmission will result in an error when an agent has not been moved to the destination computer and activated, a problem may arise in the selection and the acquisition of  messages separately from<br>
agents.<br>
[0026]<br>
The above description is explained in view of the processing performed by the source computer, t_ho destination computer and the temporary storage computer. But this invention can alt&gt;o be grasped as a computer which performs the above processings. In addition, the above processing can be implemented by a computer program, which is normally distributed by being stored on a memory medium, such as a CD-ROM or a floppy disk.<br>

[Preferred Embodiments]<br>
The preferred embodiments will now bo described refnrrinq to   the   accompanying  drawings.<br>
[0028]<br>
Example constitutions of agent 1 and message 2 in one<br>
embodiment   are   shown     in   Fig.    1.	An   agent   1   has      data   la<br>
representative of its condition and owned information,<br>
procedure      lb        representative	of      its        behavior,	and<br>
identifier 1c for identifying the agent. The agent 1 can move between computers by freezing the condition of the operation in one computer and thawing the condition in another   computer   after  being   transferred.<br>
[0029]<br>
The agent 1 can transmit information, GUch as a request or a response, to another agent. The agent 1 employs a message for this transmission. A message 2 has data 2a and an identifier 2b of a destination agent. The message 2 is transmitted even when a destination agent and a source agent are active on different computers.<br>
I 0030]<br>
Before "the embodiment  of the  present  invention is  ex-<br>
plained, the outline of a procedure for the conventional movement of an agent will be described referring to Fig. 2, and the outline of the procedure for the transfer of a message will be described referring to Fig. 3.<br>
[0031]<br>
Logical space 6, where an agent can be active, is provided for a source computer 3, and the agent 1 is active therein- A transmitter 7 of an agent movement processing mechanism for moving an agent is also provided. An agent destination computer 4 comprises a receiver 8 of an agent movement processing mechanism and logical space 6 in which an agent can be active. The source computer 3 and the destination computer 4 are connected to each other by a network 5.<br>
[0032]<br>
The outline of the processing for moving an agent will now be described. When the agent 1 moves from the source computer 3, where it is currently active, to the destination computer 4, first, the transmitter 7 of the agent movement processing mechanism performs an agent freezing process 9, to convert it into a bit sequence 11 for the frozen agent which includes, as a bit sequence, data la and the procedure lb. The converted bit sequence 11 is transferred via the network 5 to the destination computer 4. The bit sequence 11 is received by the receiver 8 of the agent movement processing mechanism, and a frozen agent reproduction process 10 converts the bit sequence into agent 1, which has data la and the procedure lb, and the agent 1 becomes active in the logical space 6 in the destination computer 4.<br>
{0O33]<br>
In the agent freezing process 9, the job the agent is currently processing is temporarily halted, and data currently held by  the agent, information concerning  program<br>
code of the agent and configuration information required for the reconstruction of the agent later, are embedded into a bit sequence. Example information concerning program code is the name of program code. version information and program code itself. As the basic technique of the agent freezing process, an example implementation method is described in "Pickling State In The Java Systems," The 2nd USENIX Conference On Object-Oriented Technologies, 1996.<br>
[0034]<br>
When an agent for transferring a message and an agent for receiving a message are active in different computers, transfer of a message must be performed via a network. An example arrangement and an outline of the required processing are shown in Fig. 3. A message transfer source computer 13 includes a logical space 6 where an agent 1 is active and a transmitter 15 of a message transfer processing mechanism. A message transfer destination computer 14 includes a logical space 6 where an agent Id for receiving messages is active. The message transfer source computer 13 and the message transfer destination computer 14 are connected together by the network 5.<br>
[0035J<br>
The outline of the message transfer processing will now be described. The agent 1 generates the message 2. The transmitter 15 of the message transfer processing mechanism performs conversion process 17 to convert the message 2 into a bit sequence 18 for a message. The bit sequence 18 is received by a receiver 16 of a message transfer processing mechanism at the message transfer destination computer 14. The receiver 16 performs a message conversion process 19 for the received bit sequence to obtain the message 2, and transmits it to a destination agent Id.<br>
 [0036]<br>
In the present invention, for the movement of the agent and the transfer of a message that was described referring to Figs. 2 and 3: 1. a temporary storage area for an agent and a message is provided on the network; and 2. a mechanism is provided that transfers the message after it has confirmed that a destination agent has arrived at an agent destination computer. The outline of the arrangement where the temporary agent storage area is provided on the Internet is shown in Fig. 4; an example agent moving arrangement including the temporary storage area is shown in Fig. 5; an example message transfer arrangement including the temporary storage area is shown in Fig. 6; movement processing of an agent is shown in Figs. 7, 8 and 9; and processing of a message transfer is shown in Figs. 10, 11 and 12. In Figs. 13 and 14 are shown formats for communication data that are to be transferred via the network shown in Figs. 7 to 12.<br>
[0037]<br>
First, Fig. 4 shows the outline of an arrangement where a temporary agent storage area for agents is provided on the Internet. On the Internet 100, it is possible to provide a plurality of servers HO and 120 for providing temporary agent storage areas. In this case, users 134 and 140 submit registration applications, in advance. to the service provider that provides the temporary agent storage service to acquire individual temporary agent storage areas and their addresses. To transmit an agent to another computer, an agent user 13O to 140 acquires the address of the computer and the address of its temporary storage area from a target user by requesting them. The agent user who obtains the address information specifies an address to which the agent moves and moves it thereto. The agent may move directly to the destination computer, or may be stored in the temporary storage area for that  computer.  In addition, a  user may<br>
designate an agent destination address, or an agent may already know it. The movement of the agent may be started in response to an instruction from a user or by the determination of the agent by itself. A user who receives an agent begins the processing for acquiring the agent from his or her temporary storage area at an appropriate time, by clicking a GUI button in a tool for managing an agent, or by performing an automatic acquisition process periodically.<br>
[0O38]<br>
Fig. 5  shows an example  arrangement for the  movement of<br>
an agent when a temporary storage area is provided.<br>
The  agent source computer  3 includes a  logical space 6,<br>
where  the  agent is  active, and  a  transmitter 7  of an<br>
agent  movement processing  mechanism.     The agent  1  is<br>
active in the logical space  6.  The transmitter 7  of the<br>
agent movement  processing  mechanism comprises  an  agent<br>
freezing unit 22,  a moving method determination  unit 23,<br>
an  agent direct  movement request transmitter  24, and an<br>
agent  temporary  storage  request  transmitter  25.   The<br>
agent   freezing  unit  22   performs  an  agent  freezing<br>
process,  and  the  moving  method determination  unit  23<br>
performs  a process for determining whether a mobile agent<br>
can move  directly to  the agent  destination computer  4.<br>
There  are  many  references  available  for   determining<br>
whether  an  agent  can move  directly  to  a  destination<br>
computer  or  not.   For example,  an  agent can  not move<br>
directly to  a destination computer  when the  computer is<br>
not  powered on  or when  direct access  from an  external<br>
network is inhibited.   The agent direct  movement request<br>
transmitter  24 must transmit a transfer request 34 of the<br>
bit  sequence  11  for the  frozen  agent  to  the  agent<br>
destination computer 4.  In other words,  the agent direct<br>
movement request  transmitter 24  has address  information<br>
of the agent destination computer  4.  The agent temporary<br>
storage   request  transmitter  25   transmits  a  storage<br>
request 35 of the bit sequence 11 of the frozen agent to an agent temporary storage server 21. In other words, the agent temporary storage • request transmitter 25 correspondingly stores an address of the temporary storage server 21 for the agent destination computer 4.<br>
(0039]<br>
The agent destination computer 4 comprises a logical space 6 where an agent is active, and a receiver 8 of an agent movement processing mechanism. The receiver 8 of the agent movement processing mechanism includes an agent reproduction unit 26, a transfer method confirmation unit 27, an agent direct movement request receiver 28, and a temporary agent storage acquisition request processing unit 29. The agent reproduction unit 26 reproduces an agent 1 from a bit sequence 11 for a frozen agent, and activates it in the logical space 6. The transfer method confirmation unit 27 receives a confirmation request 33 from the moving method determination unit 23 in the agent source computer 3, and transmits a response representing whether or not direct movement is possible. The agent direct movement request receiver 28 receives the bit sequence 11 for the frozen agent that is transmitted from the agent source computer 3, and calls the agent reproduction unit 26. The temporary agent storage acquisition request processing unit 29 transmits an agent acquisition request 36 to the agent temporary storage server 21, receives the bit sequence 11 for the frozen agent that is transferred from a temporary agent storage processor 31, and calls the agent reproduction unit 26.<br>
[0040]<br>
The agent temporary storage server 21 comprises an agent temporary storage unit 30, a temporarily stored agent acquisition unit 31, and an agent temporary storage area 32. The agent temporary storage unit 30 receives an agent temporary  storage request  35, and  stores the  bit<br><br>
sequence 11 for a frozen agent in the agent temporary storage area 32. The temporarily stored agent acquisition unit 31 receives a-temporarily stored agent acquisition request 36, reads the bit sequence 11 for the frozen agent from the agent temporary storage area 32. and transmits a temporarily stored agent transfer request 37 including the read bit sequence 11. The agent temporary storage area 32 is used to store the bit sequences 11 for frozen agents. A location in tnis area is allocated for each agent destination computer, so that when a request for the acquisition of an agent is received from an agent destination computer, which agent is to be read is understood. Bit sequences for a plurality of frozen agents can be stored in this area.<br>
[0041]<br>
Fig. 15 shows an example directory structure in a storage area and an example structure of a file for storing an agent when the agent temporary storage area is provided in a file system. A directory is prepared for each computer, and a bit sequence 11 for a frozen agent is stored as a file in a directory that corresponds to the name of a destination computer. A file name is expressed by employing the identifier of the agent as a character string. At this time, information concerning a storage date and the name of a source computer is also written as the header of a file (lower portion in Fig. 15). For example, an agent that moves from "kosaka.trl.ibm.com" to "yamamoto.trl.ibm.com" is stored as a file in a directory "yamamoto.trl.ibm.com". "kosaka.trl.ibm.com" is written in the portion of the header for the source computer, and time is written into the date portion.<br>

An  example arrangement  for  a  message transfer  when  a<br>
temporary storage area is provided is shown in Fig- 6-<br>
A message transfer source computer  13 comprises a logical<br>
space  6 where an agent is  active and a transmitter 15 of<br>
a  message transfer processing  mechanism.  An  agent 1 is<br>
active  in the logical  space 6.   In Fig. 6,  the agent 1<br>
transfers message 2  to an agent  lc that  is active in  a<br>
message   transfer   destination   computer   14.      The<br>
transmitter  15   of  the   message  transfer   processing<br>
mechanism includes  a  message/bit sequence  converter  38<br>
for  a message, a transfer method determination unit 39, a<br>
message direct transfer  unit 40, and a  message temporary<br>
storage request transmitter 41.   The message/bit sequence<br>
converter  3B converts the  message 2 into  a bit sequence<br>
18 for  the message.   The  transfer method  determination<br>
unit 39  determines  whether or  not a  message should  be<br>
transferred  directly to the  message transfer destination<br>
computer 14.   There are  many references  for determining<br>
whether or not the message can be  directly transferred to<br>
the  destination   computer.    When,  for   example,  the<br>
destination  computer  is  not  powered  on,  when  direct<br>
access  from an external  network is inhibited,  or when a<br>
destination  agent is stored in the temporary storage area<br>
and  has not  arrived  at  the destination  computer,  the<br>
direct message  transfer is  inhibited.   In other  cases,<br>
the direct  message transfer  is permitted.   The  message<br>
direct  transfer  unit  40   transfers  a  message  direct<br>
transfer request  51 to  the message  transfer destination<br>
computer  14.  In other words, the message direct transfer<br>
unit:  40 possesses  information concerning -Che  address of<br>
the  message  transfer  destination  computer  14.     The<br>
message   temporary   storage   request   transmitter   41<br>
transfers  a message  temporary storage request  52 to the<br>
agent temporary storage server 21.   That is, the  message<br>
temporary storage request transmitter 41 correspondingly<br>
possesses the address  of the temporary storage  server 21<br>
for the message transfer destination computer 14.<br>
(0043]<br>
The message transfer  destination computer  14 includes  a<br>
logical space  6 where an  agent is active  and a receiver 16 of a  message transfer processing mechanism.   An agent lc.  which is  a message  transfer destination agent,  is active  in  the logical  space 6.   The  receiver 16  of a message  transfer processing mechanism  includes a message distribution unit 42, a transfer method confirmation unit 43, a  message direct  receiver 44,  a temporarily  stored message acquisition request  processing unit 45 and  a bit sequence/message  converter 46.   The message distribution unit  42 transmits  a received message  to the destination agent  lc.    The transfer  method  confirmation  unit  43 transmits a  response relative  to a confirmation  request 50, which  is issued by  the transfer  method confirmation determination  unit 39 in the message transfer source computer  13, to  confirm  a direct  transfer.   The  message direct  receiver  44 receives  a  message  direct transfer request 51 issued  by the message direct transfer  unit 40 in  the  message   transfer  source  computer  13.     The temporarily stored message acquisition  request processing unit   45   transmits   a   temporarily   stored   message acquisition  request 53  to  the agent  temporary  storage server  21,  and  receives  a  temporarily stored  message transfer  request 54,  which is  returned  as the  result. The   bit  sequence/message  converter   46  reproduces  a message from the bit sequence 18 for  the message received by  the  message direct  receiver  44 and  the temporarily stored message acquisition request processing unit 45.<br>
[0044]<br>
The agent temporary storage server 21 comprises a message temporary storage unit 47, a temporarily stored message acquisition unit 48 and a message temporary storage area 49. Although not shown in Fig. 6, the server 21 includes an agent temporary storage unit 30 for temporarily storing an agent, a temporarily stored agent acquisition unit 31 and an agent temporary storage area 32, all of which  were described referring  to Fig.  5.    The message<br>
temporary storage unit 47 receive© a message temporary storage request 52, and stores the bit sequence 18 for the message in the message temporary storage area 49. The temporarily stored message acquisition request unit 48 receives a temporarily stored message acquisition request 54. reads the bit sequence 18 of the message from the message temporary storage area 49, and transmits a temporarily stored message transfer request 54 that includes the read bit sequence 18. The message temporary storage area 49 is used to store the bit sequence 18 for the message. A location in this area is allocated for each message transfer destination computer, and when a message acquisition request is received from the message transfer destination computer 14, which message is to be read is understood. Bit sequences for a plurality of messages can be stored in this area.<br>
[0045]<br>
Fig. 16 shows an example directory structure for a storage area and an example structure of a file for storing a message when the message temporary storage area is provided in the file system of a computer. A directory having the name of a computer is made, and in that directory, a sub-directory having the name that is a character string of an identifier of the destination agent for the message is prepared. When a message is stored as a file in the sub-directory, an appropriate file name is provided by the agent temporary storage server 21. In this case, the file is given a name selected from a series of sequential numbers. When the message is stored in the file, information including a storage date and the name of a transfer source computer is also written in the header of the file (lower portion in Fig. 16). Not only a file system but also a database can be employed to store a message.<br>
[0046]<br>
The procedures employed for the agent movement method are shown in FigB. 7, 8 and 9. Fig. 7 shows the processing performed when an agent that is active in the agent source computer 3 can be moved directly to the agent destination computer 4- Fig. 8 shows processing performed when the agent that is active in the agent source computer 3 can not be moved directly to the agent destination computer 4 and is stored temporarily. Fig. 9 shows processing performed when the agent destination computer 4 acquires an agent that was stored in the agent temporary storage server 21.<br>
[0047]<br>
Fig. 7 is a diagram showing the processing by which the agent 1 that is active in the logical space 6 of the agent source computer 3 is moved directly to the logical space 6 in the agent destination computer 4. The movement of the agent begins upon the receipt of an instruction from a user or as a result of a decision by the agent. When the agent begins to move, first, the agent freezing unit 22 performs  an agent freezing process<br>
56,	and the agent is converted into a bit sequence 11 for<br>
a frozen agent. Then, the moving method determination<br>
unit  23 performs  a moving method determination  process<br>
57.	During this process, a direct movement confirmation<br>
request 33a (Fig. 13(a)) is transmitted to the transfer<br>
method confirmation unit 27 in the destination, computer<br>
4. Upon reception of the request 33a, the moving method<br>
confirmation unit 27 in the destination computer 4<br>
performs a moving method confirmation process 60. This<br>
process involves merely the return of a direct movement<br>
acknowledgement response 33b (Fig. 13(b)). Upon the<br>
reception of this response, the moving method determina<br>
tion unit 23 in the source computer 3 calls the agent<br>
direct movement request transmitter 24. At this time, an<br>
agent direct movement request process 58 is performed,<br>
and an  agent direct  movement request  34a (Fig.   13(c)),<br>
which includes the bit sequence 11 for the frozen agent:, is transmitted to the agent direct movement request receiver 28 in the destination computer 4 by the agent direct movement request transmitter 24, which then waits for a response.<br>
[0048]<br>
Upon  the reception of  the request 34a,  the agent direct<br>
movement request receiver  28 in the destination  computer<br>
4 performs an agent direct movement request reception process 61. For this process 61, the bit sequence 11 for the frozen agent is extracted from the agent direct movement request 34a and the agent reproduction unit 26 is called to perform an agent reproduction process 62-During the process 62, the agent 1 is reproduced from the bit sequence 11 for the frozen agent so that it can become active in the logical space 6. Then, an agent direct movement request reception process 61 is performed, i.e., a process for returning an agent movement confirmation response 34b (Fig. 13(d)) to the agent direct movement request transmitter 24 in the source computer 3 and a process for recording the arrival of the agent are performed. During an agent direct movement request transmission process 58 at the source computer 3, the agent movement confirmation response 34b is received, and the agent movement process is thereafter te nninated.<br>
[00491<br>
Fig. 8 is a diagram showing the processing performed when the agent 1 that is active in the logical space 6 of the source computer 3 can not move directly to the logical space 6 in the destination computer 4, and is stored in the agent temporary storage server 21. In the moving method determination process 57, a procedure performed until a direct movement confirmation request 33a (Fig. 13(a)) is  transmitted to  the destination  computer 4  is<br>
the same as that explained referring to Fig. 7. In Fig. 8, however, it is assumed either that the destination computer 4 has not been activated, or that a communication path from the source computer 3 to the destination computer 4 has been disconnected. In these cases, transmission of the direct movement confirmation request 33a in the moving method determination process 57 has failed. As a consequence of the failure, it is determined that an agent temporary storage process must be performed, and the agent temporary storage request transmitter 25 is called. The agent temporary storage request transmitter 25 performs an agent temporary storage request transmission process 63. An agent temporary storage request 35a (Fig. 13(e)) is transmitted to the agent temporary storage unit 30 in the agent temporary storage server 21 and the agent temporary storage request transmission process 63 waits for a response.<br>
[0050]<br>
The agent temporary storage unit 30 in the agent temporary storage server 21 receives the agent temporary storage request 35a, and performs an agent temporary storage process 64. In this process, the bit sequence 11 of the frozen agent is extracted from the received request, and is stored at a location in the agent temporary storage area 32 allocated for the agent destination computer 4. Following this, an agent temporary storage confirmation response 35b (Fig. 13(f)) is transmitted to the agent temporary storage request transmitter 25 that issued the request. During an agent temporary storage request transmission process 63 performed by the source computer 3, the agent temporary storage confirmation response 35b is received, and the agent movement process is thereafter terminated.<br>
[0051]<br>
Fig. 9 is a diagram showing the processing by which the destination computer 4 acquires an agent stored in the agent temporary storage server 21. The agent destination computer 4 is automatically activated by an instruction issued by a user or by a timer and begins to acquire from the agent temporary storage server 21 an agent addressed to the computer 4. This acquisition is begun by calling the temporarily stored agent acquisition request unit 29. By this unit 29, a temporarily stored agent acquisition request process 67 is performed. For this process 67, a temporarily stored agent acquisition request 36 (Fig. 13(g)) is transmitted to the temporarily stored agent acquisition unit 31 in the agent temporary storage server 21 to wait for reception of a temporarily stored agent transfer request 37a (Fig. 13(h)). The temporarily stored agent acquisition unit 31 in the agent temporary storage server 21 performs a temporarily stored agent acquisition process 65. During this process 65, marks are provided for a group of agents and a group of messages that are currently stored to distinguish them from an agent and message that are to be received later with the agent temporary storage request 35a and the message temporary storage request 52a respectively.<br>
(0052]<br>
An example mark could be the term ".target", which is added to -the end of the name of a file used for storing an agent. For example, "06AE8A42" (Fig. 15) would be "06AE8A42.target". Similarly, for a message, a mark can be provided by adding ".target" to the end of the name of a file used for storing the message. An agent and message having such a mark would be targets for the temporarily stored agent acquisition request 36 currently processed and a temporarily stored message acquisition request 53 (Fig. 14(h)), which is transmitted immediately after the termination of the temporarily stored agent acquisition  process 65.    Therefore.  a message  for  an<br>
agent, which has been transferred to the agent temporary storage server 21 during the temporarily stored agent acquisition process 65 and a temporarily stored message acquisition process 80 and will be stored until the next agent acquisition process, can be prevented from being transferred before the stored agent is transferred to the destination computer. The bit sequence 11 for the frozen agent is read from the location in the agent temporary storage area 32 that corresponds to the agent destination computer 4, which issued the temporarily stored agent acquisition request 36. The read bit sequence 11 is transmitted as a temporarily stored agent transfer request 37a to wait for a temporarily stored agent acquisition conformation response 37b (Fig. 13(i)).<br>
[0053]<br>
Upon the reception of the temporarily stored agent transfer request 37a, the temporarily stored agent acquisition request unit 29 performs a later part of the temporarily stored agent acquisition request process 67. That is, the bit sequence 11 for the frozen agent is extracted from the temporarily stored agent transfer request 37a, and the agent reproduction unit 26 is called to perform an agent reproduction process 62. During this process 62, the agent 1 is reproduced from the bit: sequence 11 for the frozen agent, and is activated in the logical space 6. Following this, in the temporarily stored agent acquisition request process 67, a temporarily stored agent acquisition confirmation response 37b is transmitted to the temporarily stored agent acquisition unit 31 in the agent temporary storage server 21, and the arrival of the agent thereat are recorded. This recorded data is employed when the message direct transfer confirmation request 50a is received from another computer.<br>
[0054]<br>
When the temporarily  stored agent acquisition unit  31 in<br>
the agent  temporary storage  server 21  has received  the<br>
response 37b, it deletes the transmitted bit  sequence 11<br>
for the  agent from  the storage  area.   The deletion  is<br>
performed arbitrarily,  and the  transmitted bit  sequence<br>
11 for the  agent may be moved to  another storage  area.<br>
If agents with transfer target marks are  still present in<br>
the agent  temporary  storage server  21, the  temporarily<br>
stored agent acquisition  unit 31  sequentially reads  the<br>
bit sequences 11 for the  frozen agents and transmits  the<br>
temporarily  stored  agent  transfer  requests  37a  until<br>
there are  no agents with transfer target marks.  When all<br>
the target  agents have  been  transferred, a  temporarily<br>
stored  agent transfer  end  notice  37c (Fig.  13(j))  is<br>
transmitted to  the temporarily  stored agent  acquisition<br>
request unit 29.   Upon the reception of this  notice 37c,<br>
the  temporarily stored agent  acquisition request process<br>
67 is  terminated, and  the agent  acquisition process  is<br>
thereafter  completed.    However, an  additional  step of<br>
abandoning  an agent  that is determined  to be inadequate<br>
during the  acquisition request process  may be performed.<br>
A flowchart for the above processing is shown in Fig. 17.<br>
[0055]<br>
Fig. lO is a diagram showing the processing by which an agent 1 that is active in a message transfer source computer 13 directly transfers a message 2 to an agent lc that is active in a message transfer destination computer 14. The agent 1, which is active in the logical space 6 in the message transfer source computer 13, generates the message 2 and begins transmission of the message. Then, a message/bit sequence converter 38 performs a message/bit sequence conversion process 70 to obtain a bit sequence 18 for the message 2. Then, the transfer method determination unit 39 performs a transfer method determination process 71. During this process, a direct transfer request  50a (Fig. 14(a))  is transmitted  to the<br>
transfer method confirmation unit 43 in the message transfer destination computer 14, and a response is employed to determine the transfer method.<br>
(0056]<br>
The transfer method  confirmation unit 43 in  the destination computer 14,  which has received the  direct transfer confirmation  request  50a,  performs  a  transfer  method confirmation  process  74.   For  this  process 74,  if  a destination agent  is  active in  its logical  space 6,  a direct transfer acknowledgement response 50b (Fig.  14(b)) is returned.   If there  is no record  that the  agent has arrived, it is  assumed that  the agent is  stored in  the temporary storage  area, and a  direct transfer  rejection response 50c (Fig. 14(c),  see Fig. 11) is returned.   The processing  in  Fig. 10  is for  a  case where  the direct transfer acknowledgement  response 50b is returned.   When the  transfer method  determination unit  39 has  received the  direct  transfer  acknowledgement  response 50b,  the message direct  transfer unit  40 is called to perform  a message direct transfer  process 72-  In  this process 72, a  message   transfer   request  51a   (Fig.   14(d))   is transmitted  to the message direct receiver 44 in the message transfer  destination computer  14.   The process  72 waits   for  a   response   from   the  message   transfer destination computer 14.<br>
[0057]<br>
Upon reception of the request 51a, the message direct receiver 44 performs a message direct reception process 75. During this process, the bit sequence 18 for the message is extracted from the message transfer request 51a, and the bit sequence/message converter 46 is called to perform a message conversion 76 for the bit sequence 18 and reproduces the message 2. Then, the message distribution unit 42 is called to perform a message distribution process 77.  In this process  77, the message<br>
2 is transmitted to the destination agent lc that is active in the logical space 6. Following this, a message reception confirmation response 51b (Fig. 14(e)) is returned to the message transfer source computer 13. The message direct transfer unit 40 that has received this response S1b assumes the message transfer has been completed.<br>
[0058]<br>
Fig. 11 is a  diagram showing the processing that  is performed when  the agent  1 that  is active  in the  message transfer  source computer 13 can not directly transfer the message  2 to the agent  lc that is  active in the message transfer destination  computer 14,  and the  message 2  is temporarily  stored in the  agent temporary storage server 21.   The  processing performed until  the transfer method, determination unit 39 in the  message transfer source computer 13 transmits the direct  transfer request 50a is the same  as  that explained  referring to  Fig.  10.   In the processing in  Fig. 11,  however, it is  assumed that  the message  transfer destination  computer  14 has  not  been activated, that  a  communication path  from  the  message transfer  source  computer  13  to  the  message  transfer destination computer 14  has been disconnected, or  that a destination  agent  has  not arrived.     In  the  transfer method determination  process 71 performed by the transfer method  determination  unit 39,  the  transmission of  the direct  transfer confirmation  request  50a fails  if  the destination  computer has  not been  activated  or if  the communication path is  interrupted.    As a  result,  the transfer  method  determination  unit  39  in  the  source computer 13 determines  that the message should  be stored in  the  agent temporary  storage  server  21-   The  same determination is made  when the direct  transfer rejection response 50c (Fig. 14(c))  is returned.  As a  result, the message  temporary  storage  request  transmitter  41   is called,  and  it  performs  a  message  temporary  storage<br>
request transmission process 78. For this process 78, a message temporary storage request 52a (Fig. 14(f)) is transmitted to the message temporary storage unit 47 in the agent temporary storage server 21. The process 78 waits for a response from the agent temporary storage server 21.<br>
[0059]<br>
Upon the reception of the request 52a» the message temporary storage unit 47 performs a message temporary storage process 79. During this process, the bit sequence 18 of the message is extracted from the message temporary storage request 52 a, and is stored at a location in the message temporary storage area 48 that is allocated for the destination computer 14. Then, a message temporary storage confirmation response 52b (Fig. 14(9)) is returned. The message temporary storage request transmitter 41 receives this response 52b, and the message transfer process is thereafter terminated.<br>
[0060]<br>
Fig. 12 is a diagram showing the processing that is performed when the message transfer destination computer 14 acquires a message stored in the agent temporary storage server 21. The message acquisition process is begun immediately after the agent acquisition has been terminated. In a temporarily stored message acquisition request process 82, the temporarily stored message acquisition request unit 45 transmits a temporarily stored message acquisition request 53 (Fig. 14(h)) to the temporarily stored message acquisition unit 48 in the agent temporary storage server 21, and waits for a temporarily stored message transfer request 54a (Fig. 14(i)). Upon reception of the temporarily stored message acquisition request 53, the temporarily stored message acquisition unit 48 performs a temporarily stored message acquisition process 80.  For  this process, a location  in<br>
the message temporary storage area 49 is examined that corresponds to an area allocated for the computer that has issued the temporarily stored message acquisition request 53, and a message transfer process is performed for a message to which a mark is affixed. In the message transfer process 80, a temporarily stored message transfer request 54a is transmitted to the temporarily stored message acquisition request unit 45. The process 80 waits for a response from the message transfer destination computer 14.<br>
[0061]<br>
When the temporarily stored message acquisition request unit 45 receives the temporarily stored message transfer request 54a, it extracts the bit sequence 18 for the message from the request 54a, and the bit sequence/message converter 46 is called to perform a message conversion process 76 for the bit sequence and reproduces the message. Then, a message distribution process 77 is performed by the message distribution unit 42, and the message is transmitted to the destination agent Id. Following this, in a temporarily stored message acquisition request process 82, a temporarily stored message acquisition confirmation response 54b (Fig. 14(j)) is transmitted to the temporarily stored message acquisition unit 48 in the agent temporary storage server 21.<br>
[0062]<br>
Upon reception of the response 54b, the temporarily stored agent acquisition unit 48 deletes the bit sequence 18 of the transferred message. The deletion may be performed arbitrarily and the transmitted message may be stored in anther area. When there are more messages with target mark in the agent temporary storage server 21, the temporarily stored message acquisition unit 48 sequentially  reads  the respective  bit sequences  18 for<br>
the frozen messages, and repeatedly transmits the temporarily stored message transfer requests 54a until no more messages having target marks remain. When all of the target messages have been transferred, a temporarily stored message transfer end notice 54c (Fig. 14(k)) is transferred to the temporarily stored message acquisition request unit 45. Then, the temporarily stored message acquisition request process 82 is terminated, and the message acquisition process is completed. The above described processing is shown in a flowchart in Fig. 18.<br>
[0063]<br>
The present invention is not limited to the above described embodiment. For example, an agent and message transfer destination computer may transmit a data acquisition request, and in response to this, a temporary storage server may add marks to agents and messages stored in an area for the destination computer, and transfer the marked agents and messages to the destination computer. At this time, when an agent has first been transmitted, and after the termination of the transmission, a message may be transmitted, or an agent and a message related to the agent may be transmitted sequentially. The determination of the source computer whether or not direct movement (transmission) of an agent is possible may be performed by the agent.<br>
[0064]<br>
Although marks may be attached to the agent and message in the temporarily stored agent acquisition process, in the temporarily stored agent acquisition process or in the agent temporary storage process, a list of stored agents and/or messages may be prepared and marks be attached in the list.<br>
[0065]<br>
Another  embodiment  is  also  provided.     Fig. 19  is  a<br>
diagram showing another embodiment when an agent destination computer 4 acquires a bit sequence 11 for an agent and/or a bit sequence 18 for a message from an agent temporary storage server 21. There is a case where a user of the destination computer 4 wants to select an agent stored in the temporary storage server 21 and to execute only the selected agent at the destination computer 4. The user instructs a temporarily stored agent acquisition request unit 29 (Fig. 5) to begin a temporarily stored agent list acguisition process 87. In the temporarily stored agent list acquisition process 87, a temporarily stored agent list acquisition request 90a (Fig. 20(a)) is transmitted to the temporary storage server 21. Upon reception of the request 90a, a temporarily stored agent acquisition unit 31 (Fig. 5) in the temporary storage server 21 begins a temporarily stored agent list acquisition process 84. In the list acquisition process 84, the names of agents are acquired that are stored in the storage area for a source computer of the request 90a when the list acquisition request 90a has received, and a list is prepared. When the bit sequence 11 for an agent is stored in a file system shown in Fig. 15. the file name of the bit sequence 11 for the agent is acquired in the directory of the source computer. While an agent list is referenced In this embodiment, a message list can be handled in the same manner.<br>
[0066]<br>
When an agent list is prepared, the list is transmitted as a temporarily stored agent list transfer 90b (Fig.20(b)) to the requesting source computer. In a temporarily stored agent list acquisition request process 87, the agent destination computer 4 receives the list and provides it for a user. The process 87 is thereafter terminated. The user can employ this list to determine which  agents can  be executed  by  the agent  destination<br>
computer 4.<br>
[0067]<br>
When the user selects a specific agent from the agent list, a specific temporarily stored agent acquisition request process 88 is begun. In this process 88, a specific temporarily stored agent acquisition request 91a (Fig. 20(c)), which includes the identifier of a specific agent, is transmitted to the temporary storage server 21. In response to the specific temporarily stored agent acquisition request 91a, the agent temporary storage server 21 begins a specific temporarily stored agent acquisition process 85. In the acquisition process 85, a bit sequence for a stored agent is read by using the identifier of an agent in the acquisition request 91a, and is transmitted as a specific temporarily stored agent transfer 91b (Fig. 20(d)) to the source computer. At this time, a mark would be attached to a message corresponding to a specific agent to ensure transmission of the message to the specific agent.<br>
[0068]<br>
Upon reception of the specific temporarily stored agent transfer 91b, in the specific temporarily stored agent acquisition request process 88 the acquired agent is recorded and the bit sequence for the agent is transmitted to an agent reproduction process 62. In this process, as described above, the frozen agent is converted into a form executable in the logical space 6. A reproduced agent is activated in the logical space 6.<br>
[0069]<br>
In the specific temporarily stored agent acquisition process 85, the transmitted agent may be deleted from the agent temporary storage area 32, or may be stored in another area.<br>
 [0070]<br>
When the specific temporarily stored agent acquisition process 85 is terminated, a message for the previously specified agent is acquired. This is the same as the previously mentioned temporarily stored message acquisition request process 82. The acquisition request process 82 and the temporarily stored message acquisition process 80 in the temporary storage server 21 exchange with each other the temporarily stored message acquisition request 53, a temporarily stored message transfer request 54a, a temporarily stored message acquisition confirmation response S4b and a temporarily stored message transfer end notice 54c, and a message to which a mark is affixed is transmitted to the destination computer 4. The message, which is received by the destination computer 4 and is addressed to a specific agent, is transmitted from the temporarily stored message acquisition process 82 to the bit sequence/message converter 76. The bit sequence/message converter 76 converts the bit sequence for the message into a form interpretable by an agent, and the message distribution unit 77 transmits it to the agent.<br>
[0071]<br>
In Fig. 19, a user acquires a list of agents stored in the temporary storage server 21. By using this list, the user can specify undesirable agents and received agents, and can delete them from the temporary storage area 32. In such a case, a user deletes or specifies an agent and begins a specific temporarily stored agent deletion request process 89. The specific temporarily stored agent deletion request process 89 transmits a specific temporarily stored agent deletion request 92a (Fig. 20(e)) to the temporary storage server 21. In response to the deletion request 92a, the temporary storage server 21 activates the specific temporarily stored agent deletion  process  86.   The  specific  temporarily stored<br>
agent deletion process 86 refers to the identifier of an agent in the deletion request 92a to check a region in the storage area 32 allocated for the requesting source computer. When the bit sequence 11 for an agent that has the same identifier is detected, the bit sequence is deleted.<br>
[0072]<br>
It is preferable that the region in which the bit sequence for message is stored is checked at this time because a message to a deleted agent is sometimes useless even when it is transmitted to the agent destination computer 4.<br>
[0073]<br>
When the bit sequence for a specific agent is deleted, the specific temporarily stored agent deletion process 86 transmits a specific temporarily stored agent deletion end notice 92b (Fig. 20(f)) to the requesting computer-In response to the notice 92b, a specific temporarily stored agent deletion request process 89 in the destination computer 4 deletes an entry for the deleted agent from the temporarily stored agent list, and terminates the processing. As a result, a user will not select an agent deleted from the list.<br>
[0074]<br>
A process for deleting the entry of a specific agent from the list is required for the specific agent acquisition request process 88 because in the specific temporarily stored agent acquisition process 85 a transmitted agent is so set that it is immediately deleted. It should be noted that a method may be employed whereby a list of temporarily stored agents is merely employed as a reference and the contents of the list is not guaranteed.<br>
[0075]<br>
