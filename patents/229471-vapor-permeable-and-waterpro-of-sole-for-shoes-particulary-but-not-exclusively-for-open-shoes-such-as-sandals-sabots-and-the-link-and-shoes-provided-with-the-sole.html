				<td>VAPOR-PERMEABLE AND WATERPROOF SOLE FOR SHOES,<br>
PARTICULARLY BUT NOT EXCLUSIVELY FOR OPEN SHOES SUCH<br>
AS SANDALS, SABOTS AND THE LIKE, AND SHOE PROVIDED<br>
WITH THE SOLE<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a vapor-permeable and waterproof<br>
sole for shoes, particularly but not exclusively for open shoes such as<br>
sandals, sabots and the like.<br>
Background Art<br>
The present invention also relates to a shoe provided with said sole.<br>
It is known that the comfort of a shoe is linked not only to correct<br>
anatomical fit but also to correct outward transmission of the water vapor<br>
formed inside the shoe due to sweating, in order to avoid the "damp toor<br>
nhenomenon.<br>
This permeation of the water vapor, however, must not compromise<br>
the waterproofness of the shoe, and therefore solutions have been studied<br>
which entrust vapor permeation to the upper or to the sole.<br>
As regards the upper, there are shoes with an upper made of vapor-<br>
permeable and waterproof material.<br>
However, this type of shoe does not effectively solve the problem of<br>
vapor permeation: the "damp foot"problem arises from the fact that during<br>
sweating the sweat evaporates from the foot and cools it If evaporation is<br>
prevented, the sweat condenses and leaves the foot damp.<br>
Most of the sweat of the foot is originated at the interface between the<br>
sole of the foot and the sole of the shoe, and it is evident that the sweat<br>
formed here is unable to evaporate, thus condensing on the plantar element<br>
on which the foot rests. Only a minimal part of the sweat evaporates through<br>
the upper, even if said upper is reduced to a minimum.<br>
Solutions to the problem are provided by vapor-permeable and<br>
waterproof soles, which accordingly allow permeation of the sweat<br><br>
generated at the sole of the foot.<br>
One of these solutions is disclosed in US-5,044,096 and EP-0382 904<br>
by the same Applicant and consists in dividing the sole into two layers with<br>
through holes and in interposing a membrane that is impermeable to water<br>
and vapor-permeable and is joined perimetrically and hermetically to the<br>
two layers.<br>
Variations of this solution are disclosed in subsequent patents, all of<br>
which are in any case centered on dividing the sole into two layers, with the<br>
interposition of a waterproof and vapor-permeable membrane.<br>
In view of the fact that most of the sweat of the foot is generated at<br>
the interface between the sole of the foot and the sole of the shoe, the "damp<br>
foot" problem is considerable even in open shoes, such as sandals, sabots,<br>
mules for seaside use, et cetera.<br>
These kinds of open shoe are generally constituted by an upper that<br>
only partially wraps around the foot insertion region and by a multilayer<br>
sole.<br>
With reference from the top downwardly, such multilayer sole<br>
comprises a first layer, which makes direct contact with the foot and is<br>
generally made of leather or synthetic material.<br>
If such layer is made of non-vapor-permeable material (such as for<br>
example mules for seaside use), sweat condenses immediately, leaving an<br>
almost instantaneous feeling of dampness at the foot.<br>
If the layer is made of a vapor-permeable material that has some<br>
absorbent power, the foot remains dry until such layer becomes impregnated<br>
with sweat.<br>
Below the first layer there is a second layer, which is generally<br>
contoured anatomically and is generally made of an expanded or compact<br>
material, such as polyurethane, cork, wood, expanded rubbers, et cetera.<br>
Finally, there is a tread, which makes contact with the ground and can<br>
be made of synthetic material (rubber, polyurethane), natural material<br><br>
(leather), or mixed material.<br>
The various layers are coupled by means of adhesives or, as an<br>
alternative, by injection-molding the various layers of polymeric material<br>
over the others.<br>
Below the second layer, if it is made of soft or low-consistency<br>
material, there is a supporting layer, so as to provide a rigidity and hardness<br>
that allow to glue the flaps of the upper between the tread and said<br>
supporting layer.<br>
For open shoes that must have a certain comfort degree, it is<br>
important that the supporting plantar element (or insole) be sufficiently soft<br>
and anatomically contoured.<br>
This leads to the need to use, for the second layer (and optionally also<br>
for the third layer), soft materials, such as "sponges" or the like, in order to<br>
accommodate the foot and surround its sole.<br>
However, this surrounding prevents correct circulation of the air<br>
between the skin of the foot and the plantar element on which the foot rests,<br>
leading to almost immediate condensation, which cannot be dissipated<br>
through the sole.<br>
Furthermore, the foot transfers heat to the surrounding material,<br>
which retains it and produces a "padding" effect that further overheats the<br>
foot.<br>
If a rigid plantar element were used, the foot would have fewer points<br>
of contact with said plantar element, allowing better ventilation and<br>
optimum cooling of the foot.<br>
Therefore, as the rigidity of the plantar element increases (and<br>
therefore the comfort of the shoe decreases), the freshness of the foot<br>
increases. Vice versa, the lower the rigidity and hardness of the plantar<br>
element (and therefore the greater the comfort degree of the shoe), the<br>
stronger the "sweaty foot" effect.<br>
Moreover, as already mentioned, lack of vapor permeation of the<br><br>
layers below the foot leads to almost immediate condensation on the sole of<br>
the foot. This lack of permeation is due both to the type of materials used<br>
(particularly for the tread) and to any films of adhesive that join the various<br>
layers.<br>
The causes of the "sweaty foot" effect in open shoes provided with an<br>
anatomically contoured soft plantar element can therefore be summarized in<br>
three aspects: the surrounding of the foot by the anatomically contoured<br>
layer, which prevents correct recirculation of air between the sole and the<br>
plantar element; the "padding" effect caused by said surrounding; and the<br>
lack of permeation of the sweat in the direction of the tread.<br>
Disclosure of the Invention<br>
The aim of the present invention is to provide a vapor-permeable and,<br>
waterproof sole for shoes, particularly but not exclusively for open shoes<br>
such as sandals, sabots and the like, that allows to solve the problems met in<br>
known types.<br>
Within this aim, an important object of the present invention is to<br>
provide a vapor-permeable and waterproof sole for shoes, particularly but<br>
not exclusively for open shoes such as sandals, sabots and the like, that is<br>
comfortable both in terms of fit and of vapor permeation of the sole of the<br>
foot.<br>
Another important object of the present invention is to provide a<br>
vapor-permeable and waterproof sole for shoes, particularly but not<br>
exclusively for open shoes such as sandals, sabots and the like, that while<br>
maintaining characteristics of comfort for the foot reduces the padding<br>
effect with respect to the foot.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a vapor-<br>
permeable and waterproof sole for shoes, particularly but not exclusively for<br>
open shoes such as sandals, sabots and the like, that allows correct<br>
recirculation of air between the skin of the sole of the foot and the<br>
supporting plantar element.<br><br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a shoe with a<br>
vapor-permeable and waterproof sole, particularly but not exclusively of the<br>
open type such as sandals, sabots and the like, that is comfortable both in<br>
terms of fit and of vapor permeation of the sole of the foot.<br>
This aim and these and other objects that will become better apparent<br>
hereinafter are achieved by a vapor-permeable and waterproof sole for<br>
shoes, particularly but not exclusively for open shoes such as sandals, sabots<br>
and the like, characterized in that it comprises the following combination of<br>
elements:<br>
—	a lower element, on which a tread is integrated in a downward<br>
region, said lower element being selected between an element that is vapor-<br>
permeable at least in an upward region and a perforated element;<br>
-- an upper vapor-permeable and/or perforated element;<br>
—	a vapor-permeable and waterproof membrane, interposed between<br>
said lower element and said upper element, said membrane and said lower<br>
and upper elements being joined hermetically in the perimetric regions of<br>
mutual contact,<br>
~ at least one vapor-permeable comfort layer, which is included in<br>
said lower element and/or in said upper element and is made of three-<br>
dimensional fabric, forming a ventilation gap.<br>
Advantageously, the invention includes a shoe provided with said<br>
sole.<br>
Brief description of the drawings<br>
Further characteristics and advantages of the invention will become<br>
better apparent from the description of some preferred but not exclusive<br>
embodiments thereof, illustrated by way of nonlimiting example in the<br>
accompanying drawings, wherein:<br>
Figure 1 is a longitudinal sectional view of an open shoe of the sandal<br>
type, using a first embodiment of a sole according to the invention;<br>
Figure 2 is an enlarged-scale view of Figure 1;<br><br>
A protective element 18, constituted by a layer of hydrolysis-resistant,<br>
water-repellent, vapor-permeable or perforated material, is coupled to said<br>
membrane at the face that is directed toward the lower element 11.<br>
Said protective element 18 has the same plan dimensions as the<br>
membrane 16.<br>
The area occupied in plan view by the membrane 16 is the same area<br>
occupied by the through holes formed through the lower element 11 and the<br>
upper element 13.<br>
The upper element 13 is arranged substantially above the membrane 16<br>
and consists of multiple layers, all of which are vapor-permeable or perforated,<br>
as described hereinafter.<br>
The upper layer of said upper element 13 consists of a first layer 13a<br>
made of vapor-permeable and/or perforated material, such as for example<br>
perforated leather.<br>
Below said first layer 13a a second layer is provided, which coincides<br>
with, or is the very vapor-permeable comfort layer 14, made of a three-<br>
dimensional fabric.<br>
Said three-dimensional fabric forms a ventilation gap 19, which is<br>
deformed only partially under the weight of a person, avoiding total collapse of<br>
said gap and thus always maintaining a ventilation space.<br>
Openwork fabrics of the mesh type, known as "mesh" in shoe-making<br>
jargon, are produced and used as vapor-permeable uppers or internal linings,<br>
particularly in sports shoes.<br>
Fabrics that combine a needle-punched element with the mesh fabric<br>
and are known as "air mesh" are known as a derivative of said mesh fabrics.<br>
In this embodiment, the three-dimensional fabric of said vapor-<br>
permeable comfort layer 14 is of the air mesh type or is in any case a needle-<br>
punched fabric of suitable strength.<br>
Below said vapor-permeable comfort or second layer 14 a third 20<br>
is provided, which is contoured anatomically with respect to the sole of<br><br>
the foot and is made for example of expanded matenal that is apertorated;<br>
substantially at right angles to the extension of the sole 10<br>
In particular, the vapor-permeable comfort layer 14 has smaller plan<br>
dimensions than said third layer 20 and is arranged inside a comDlemeniarv<br>
flat cavity formed centrally with respect to said third layer.<br>
In this embodiment, a fourth layer 21 is provided below the third<br>
layer 20 and is perforated at right angles to the extension of the sole: said<br>
fourth layer 21 is necessary when the upper layers are unable to ensure the<br>
correct rigidity or hardness of the entire upper element 13 and can therefore<br>
be optional in other embodiments.<br>
In different embodiments (not shown in the figures), said fourth layer<br>
21 can be vapor-permeable instead of perforated and can also be arranged in<br>
other positions, such as for example between the second vapor-permeable<br>
comfort layer 14 and the third layer 20.<br>
Furthermore, said fourth layer 21, if provided so as to protrude with<br>
respect to the second layer 14 and the third layer 20, can be used to allow<br>
any external stitched seams.<br>
The leather of the first layer Ba is directed outwardly so as to fit the<br>
sole by wrapping around the edge of the second layer 14 or optionally also<br>
wrapping around the lateral edge of the third layer 20, as in the case of so-<br>
called "fussbett" plantar elements.<br>
A second embodiment of the sole according to the invention is shown<br>
in Figure 3 and is designated by the reference numeral 100.<br>
Like the first described embodiment, said sole 100 comprises a lower<br>
element 111, on which a tread 112 for contact with the ground is integrated<br>
in a downward region, and an upper element 113.<br>
Said upper element 113 is composed of a plurality of layers, similar to<br>
those of the sole 10, shown in the first embodiment.<br>
A vapor-permeable comfort layer 114 is provided between said layers<br>
and is made of a three-dimensional fabric that forms a ventilation gap 119<br><br>
which, under the weight of a person, undergoes only a partial deformation,<br>
avoiding complete collapse of said gap and thus always maintaining a<br>
ventilation space.<br>
In this embodiment also, said three-dimensional fabric is of the air<br>
mesh type or is in any case a needle-punched fabric.<br>
A vapor-permeable and waterproof membrane 116 is interposed<br>
between the lower element 111 and the upper element 113 and is sealed<br>
perimetrically to the sole 100.<br>
In this second embodiment, along the plan extension of the upper part<br>
of the lower element 111 there is a portion 117 that is provided with lateral<br>
venting elements 106 between the outside of the sole 100 and the inside of<br>
said portion 117.<br>
Said lateral venting elements 106 are functionally connected to the<br>
membrane 116.<br>
In particular, in this second embodiment, said portion 117 has, in its<br>
central part, a hollow region 117a that is delimited perimetrically by edges<br>
117b, on which said lateral venting elements 106 are provided; said venting<br>
elements are constituted by through venting channels 107 that functionally<br>
connect the inside of the hollow region 117a and the outside of the sole 100.<br>
A layer-like element 120 that is structured like a lattice, forms<br>
cavities and is perforated substantially at right angles to the extension of the<br>
sole is arranged inside said hollow region 117a.<br>
A variation of said second embodiment 100, shown in Figure 4 and<br>
designated by the reference numeral 100a, has a vapor-permeable element<br>
120a instead of the latticed layer-like element 120.<br>
A third embodiment of the sole according to the invention, which is a<br>
variation with respect to said second embodiment, is shown in Figure 5 and<br>
designated by the reference numeral 200.<br>
In said third embodiment, protrusions 220a extend substantially at<br>
right angles to the extension of the sole from the inside of the hollow region<br><br>
(now designated by the reference numeral 217a) formed in the central part<br>
of the upper portion 217 of the lower element 211 and form a lattice-like<br>
structure that forms cavities.<br>
Said protrusions 220a have a height that is substantially equal to the<br>
depth of said hollow region 217a.<br>
The protective element 218 of the vapor-permeable and waterproof<br>
membrane 216 is arranged so as to rest on the protrusions 220a.<br>
A fourth embodiment of the sole according to the invention, which is<br>
a variation with respect to said second embodiment, is shown in Figure 6<br>
and is designated by the reference numeral 300.<br>
In this fourth embodiment, the upper portion (now designated by the<br>
reference numeral 317) of the lower element 311 is constituted by a<br>
corresponding vapor-permeable layer-like element 320, which lies along the<br>
entire transverse extension of the upper part 317; in this case, the lateral<br>
venting elements are provided by the vapor-permeable layer-like element<br>
320 proper (the element 320 is vapor-permeable both vertically and<br>
horizontally).<br>
Above the vapor-permeable layered element 320 there is the<br>
membrane 316, with the protective element 318.<br>
Different embodiments of the soles 100, 200, 300 are designated<br>
respectively in Figures 7, 8 and 9 by the reference numerals 400, 500, 600.<br>
Said figures show a combination of lateral venting elements 406, 506, 606<br>
(which are different depending on the respective variation) and of holes,<br>
respectively 415, 515,615, that pass through the tread.<br>
Other variations (not shown in the figures) can include other vapor-<br>
permeable comfort layers made of three-dimensional fabric, which are<br>
arranged for example directly below the main vapor-permeable comfort<br>
layer already described or in any case depending on the requirements of<br>
optimum modulation of the hardness of the sole.<br>
The invention further provides a shoe formed with a sole thus<br><br>
described.<br>
The proposed figures are sectional views of shoes of the sandal type,<br>
which use the soles thus described; in said figures, the upper of the shoes is<br>
designated by the reference numeral 50, 150, 150a, 250, 350 respectively.<br>
The flaps of said uppers are coupled in a known manner to the respective<br>
soles.<br>
the mutual fixing of the various layers and elements of the soles thus<br>
described can include spot adhesive bonding, such as to avoid forming<br>
layers of adhesive on the vapor-permeable or perforated layers that would<br>
block the outflow of sweat and the passage of air.<br>
Said fixing can also be achieved by means of merely perimetric<br>
gluing (therefore outside the area occupied by the membrane and by the<br>
various holes), by means of stitched seams, heat-sealing with<br>
thermoformation, or other known types of systems.<br>
In practice it has been found that the invention thus described solves<br>
the problems noted in known types of vapor-permeable and waterproof<br>
soles; in particular, the present invention provides a vapor-permeable and<br>
waterproof sole for shoes, particularly but not exclusively for open shoes<br>
such as sandals, sabots and the like, that allows optimum vapor permeability<br>
of the sole of the foot together with a comfortable fit.<br>
The present invention in fact provides a sole with a soft plantar<br>
element that is obtained by means of a three-dimensional fabric of the air<br>
mesh type, which allows optimum ventilation between the skin of the sole<br>
of the foot and the plantar element.<br>
Moreover, said three-dimensional fabric avoids the padding effect<br>
caused by the surrounding arrangement, since it does not retain heat.<br>
Furthermore, the vapor-permeable structure allows effective vapor<br>
permeation and venting of the sweat in a downward direction, which is<br>
closed by the tread; the waterproof membrane prevents the dirt and moisture<br>
present on the ground from being transmitted to the sole of the foot, and at<br><br>
