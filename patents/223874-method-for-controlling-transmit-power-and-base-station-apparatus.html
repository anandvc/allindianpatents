				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
METHOD FOR CONTROLLING TRANSMIT POWER AND BASE STATION<br>
APPARATUS<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a method for<br>
controlling transmit power and base station apparatus.<br>
Background Art<br>
In the field of mobile communications,<br>
technological studies on a multimedia<br>
broadcast/multicast service (hereinafter referred to as<br>
"MBMS") are being carried forward recently (e.g., see<br>
"3GPP TS 22.146 V6.0.0 (2002-06): 3rd Generation<br>
Partnership Project; Technical Specification Group<br>
Services and System Aspects; Multimedia<br>
Broadcast/Multicast Service; Stage 1 (Release 6) June<br>
2002") . A communication carried out in an MBMS is not<br>
a one-to-one (Point to Point: P-to-P) communication but<br>
one-to-multi (Point to Muiti: P-to-M) communication.<br>
That is, in the MBMS, one base station transmits the same<br>
data (e.g., music data and video image data, etc.) to<br>
a plurality of mobile stations simultaneously.<br>
The MBMS has a broadcast mode and multicast mode.<br>
While the broadcast mode is a mode in which information<br>
is transmitted to all mobile stations as with current<br>
radio broadcasting, the multicast mode is a mode in which<br>
information is transmitted to only specific mobile<br>
stations affiliating a news group or other services.<br>
Advantages in carrying out the MBMS include the<br>
following: That is, when each mobile station receives<br>
information transmitted from a base station through a<br>
streaming service, etc., using one channel, if the number<br>
of mobile stations requesting the information increases,<br>
the load on the radio channel increases. However, when<br>
the MBMS is used, even if the number of mobile stations<br>
increases, all those mobile stations receive the<br>
information using the same channel, and therefore it is<br>
possible to increase the number of mobile stations capable<br>
of receiving the information without increasing the load<br>
on the radio channel. Currently, distribution of traffic<br>
information, music distribution, news distribution at<br>
a station, distribution of live coverage of a sport event,<br>
etc., are considered as services available using the MBMS<br>
and providing these services at a transmission rate of<br>
approximately 8 to 256 kbps is under study.<br>
In an MBMS, use of an S-CCPCH (Secondary Common<br>
Control Physical Channel) which is used in a current W-CDMA<br>
mobile communication scheme as a channel to transmit the<br>
same data to a plurality of mobi le stations simultaneously<br>
is under study. The S-CCPCH is a downlink common channel<br>
and is used as a paging signal and for data transmission<br>
from a higher layer according to the current W-CDMA mobile<br>
communication scheme. Furthermore, the S-CCPCH does not<br>
perform transmit power control and transmits data with<br>
relatively large constant transmit power that can cover<br>
the entire cell (e.g., see "3GPP TS 25.211 V5.1.0<br>
(2002-06) : 3rd Generation Partnership Project; Technical<br>
Specification Group Radio Access Network; Physical<br>
channels and mapping of transport channels onto physical<br>
channels (FDD) (Release 5) June 2002, 5.3.3.4 Secondary<br>
Common Control Physical Channel (S-CCPCH"). This<br>
constant transmit power is instructed from a higher layer<br>
(control station) to the base station.<br>
Here, as shown in FIG.1, even if an MBMS is carried<br>
out, not only the S-CCPCH for the MBMS but also a DPCH<br>
(Dedicated Physical Channel) for carrying out normal<br>
speech communication and transmission of dedicated<br>
control information, etc., exists as with conventional<br>
cases between the base station and mobile station. The<br>
DPCH is an uplink/downlink bidirectional dedicated<br>
channel and the DPCH is a channel dedicatedly assigned<br>
to each mobile station as opposed to the S-CCPCH which<br>
is a channel commonly used for all mobile stations within<br>
the cell.<br>
As described above, the transmit power of the S-CCPCH<br>
is transmit power which is so large and constant that<br>
it reaches the cell boundary irrespective of the positions<br>
of mobile stations located in the cell. For this reason,<br>
for a mobile station located near the base station, its<br>
reception quality becomes excessive, which results in<br>
waste. Furthermore, interference with other cells also<br>
increases causing a reduction of the subscriber capacity<br>
(system capacity) of the entire system. Furthermore, an<br>
upper limit (maximum transmit power at the base station)<br>
of total transmit power of all channels is predetermined<br>
for the base station, and therefore if the transmit power<br>
of the S-CCPCH is large as shown in FIG.1, transmit power<br>
available for other channels such as the DPCH is relatively<br>
reduced and communication quality of a speech<br>
communication, etc., deteriorates.<br>
Disclosure of Invention<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide<br>
a method for controlling transmit power and a base station<br>
apparatus capable of appropriately controlling transmit<br>
power of a common channel for an MEMS so as to prevent<br>
the transmit power from becoming excessive.<br>
The present inventor et al. have come up with the<br>
present invention by noticing the fact that while an<br>
S-CCPCH has only a downlink direction, a DPCH has both<br>
directions of uplink and downlink and discovering that<br>
it is possible to use an uplink DPCH to transmit a TPC<br>
command for the S-CCPCH to a base station. Thus, in order<br>
to solve the above described problem and attain the object,<br>
the present invention allows each mobile station in an<br>
MBMS to transmit both a TPC command for a downlink common<br>
channel and a TPC command for a downlink dedicated channel<br>
to a base station through an uplink dedicated channel.<br>
In this way, it is possible to appropriately control<br>
transmit power of a common channel used to transmit MBMS<br>
data .<br>

Best Mode for Carrying out the Invention<br>
With reference now to the attached drawings,<br>
embodiments of the present invention will be explained<br>
in detail below. The following embodiments assume a<br>
mobile communication system which carries out an MBMS<br>
and will describe a case where an S-CCPCH is used as a<br>
downlink common channel to simultaneously transmit the<br>
same data to a plurality of mobile stations and DPCHs<br>
are used as downlink dedicated channels individually<br>
assigned to a plurality of mobile stations as an example.<br>
(Embodiment 1)<br>
FIG.2 is a block diagram showing a configuration<br>
of a mobile station according to Embodiment 1 of thepresent<br>
invention. This mobile station is used in a mobile<br>
communication system in which an MBMS is carried out.<br>
The mobile station shown in FIG.2 includes an antenna<br>
10, a reception RF section 15, an S-CCPCH reception section<br>
100, a DPCH reception section 200, a DPCH transmission<br>
section 300 and a transmission RF section 20. The S-CCPCH<br>
reception section 100 includes a despreading section 110,<br>
a demodulation section 120, a decoding section 130, an<br>
SIR measuring section 140 and a TPC command creation<br>
section 150. The DPCH reception section 200 includes a<br>
despreading section 210, a demodulation section 220, a<br>
decoding section 230, an SIR measuring section 240, a<br>
TPC command extraction section 250 and a TPC command<br>
creation section 260. The DPCH transmission section 300<br>
includes an encoding section 310, a modulation section<br>
320 and a spreading section 330.<br>
The reception RF section 15 applies down-conversion,<br>
AGC (Auto Gain Control) and A/D conversion, etc., to a<br>
signal received through the antenna 10. Then, the<br>
received signal is input to the despreading section 110<br>
and despreading section 210.<br>
The despreading section 110 of the S-CCPCH reception<br>
section 100 applies despreading processing to the<br>
received signal using a spreading code assigned to a<br>
downlink S-CCPCH. The demodulation section 120<br>
demodulates the despread signal such as QPSK. The<br>
demodulated signal is input to the decoding section 130<br>
and SIR measuring section 140. The decoding section 130<br>
carries out a forward error correction and CRC (Cyclic<br>
Redundancy Check) on the demodulated received signal of<br>
the S-CCPCH and decodes the received signal of the S-CCPCH.<br>
In this way, received data (bit string) of the S-CCPCH<br>
is obtained. The SIR measuring section 140 measures a<br>
reception SIR of the S-CCPCH. The measured SIR is input<br>
to the TPC command creation section 150. The TPC command<br>
creation section 150 compares the reception SIR of the<br>
S-CCPCH with a target SIR for the S-CCPCH and creates<br>
a TPC command for the downlink S-CCPCH based on the<br>
comparison result. When the measured SIR is equal to or<br>
greater than the target SIR, a TPC command for instructing<br>
a reduction (Down) of transmit power is created and when<br>
the measured SIR is less than the target SIR, a TPC command<br>
for instructing an increase (Up) cf transmit power is<br>
created. The created TPC command for the downlink S-CCPCH<br>
is input to the encoding section 310.<br>
The despreading section 210 of the DPCH reception<br>
section 200 applies despreading processing to the<br>
received signal using a spreading code assigned to the<br>
downlink DPCH of the own station. The demodulation<br>
section 220 demodulates the despread signal such as QPSK.<br>
The demodulated signal is input to the decoding section<br>
230 and SIR measuring section 240. The decoding section<br>
230 carries out a forward error correction and CRC on<br>
the demodulated received signal of the DPCH and decodes<br>
the received signal of the DPCH . In this way, the received<br>
data (bit string) of the DPCH is obtained. The received<br>
data of the DPCH is input to the TPC command extraction<br>
section 250. The TPC command extraction section 250<br>
extracts a TPC command for the uplink DPCH placed in a<br>
time slot of the received data of the D?CH. The extracted<br>
TPC command for the uplink DPCH is input to the transmission<br>
RF section 20. The SIR measuring section 240 measures<br>
the reception SIR of the DPCH. The measured SIR is input<br>
to the TPC command creation section 260. The TPC command<br>
creation section 260 compares the reception SIR of the<br>
DPCH with a target SIR for the DPCH and creates a TPC<br>
command for the downlink DPCH based on the comparison<br>
result. When the measured SIR is equal to or greater than<br>
the target SIR, a TPC command instructing "Down" is created<br>
and when the measured SIR is less than the target SIR,<br>
a TPC command instructing "Up" is created. The created<br>
TPC command for the downlink DPCH is input to the encoding<br>
section 310.<br>
The encoding section 310 of the DPCH transmission<br>
section 300 carries out convolution coding and CRC coding<br>
on the transmission data (bit string) of the DPCH to encode<br>
the transmission data of the DPCH and constructs a<br>
transmission frame composed of a plurality of time slots.<br>
At this time, the encoding section 310 arranges the TPC<br>
command for the downlink DPCH and TPC command for the<br>
downlink S-CCPCH in the time slot. The method for the<br>
arrangement will be described later. The modulation<br>
section 320 applies modulation processing such as QPSK<br>
to the transmission data. The spreading section 330<br>
applies spreading processing to the modulated<br>
transmission signal using a spreading code assigned to<br>
the uplink DPCH of the own station. The transmission<br>
signal after the spreading is input to the transmission<br>
RF section 20.<br>
The transmission RF section 20 carries out<br>
processing such as D/A conversion, transmit power control<br>
and up-conversion, etc., on the transmission signal after<br>
the spreading by the spreading section 330 and then<br>
transmits the transmission signal from the antenna 10<br>
to the base station through the uplink DPCH. In this case,<br>
the transmission RF section 20 controls the transmit power<br>
of the uplink DPCH according to the TPC command for the<br>
uplink DPCH input from the TPC command extraction section<br>
250.<br>
Then, the configuration of the base station will<br>
be explained. FIG.3 is a block diagram showing a<br>
configuration of the base station according to Embodiment<br>
1 of the present invention. This base station is used<br>
in a mobile communication system which carries out an<br>
MBMS .<br>
The base station shown in FIG.3 includes an antenna<br>
25, a reception RF section 30, DPCH reception sections<br>
400-1 to 400-K, a TPC command selection section 35, an<br>
S-CCPCH transmission section 500, DPCH transmission<br>
sections 600-1 to 600-K and a transmission RF section<br>
40. Furthermore, there are K DPCH reception sections<br>
400-1 to 400-K, where K is the maximum number of mobile<br>
stations with which the base station can communicate,<br>
and each DPCH reception section includes a despreading<br>
section 410, a demodulation section 420, a decoding<br>
section 430, an SIR measuring section 440, a TPC command<br>
extraction section 450 and a TPC command creation section<br>
460. The DPCH reception section 400-1 is for the mobile<br>
station 1 and the DPCH reception section 400-K is for<br>
the mobile station K. The S-CCPCH transmission section<br>
500 includes an encoding section 510, a modulation section<br>
520, a spreading section 530 and a power control section<br>
540. Furthermore, there are K DPCH transmission sections<br>
600-1 to 600-K, where K is the maximum number of mobile<br>
stations with which the base station can communicate and<br>
each DPCH transmission section includes an encoding<br>
section 610, a modulation sect ion 620, a spreading section<br>
630 and a power control section 640. The DPCH<br>
transmission section 600-1 is for the mobile station 1<br>
and the DPCH transmission section 600-K is for the mobile<br>
station K.<br>
The reception RF section 30 applies down-conversion,<br>
AGC and A/D conversion, etc., to the signal received<br>
through the antenna 25. Then, the received signal is<br>
input to the respective despreading sections 410 of the<br>
DPCH reception sections 400-1 to 400-K.<br>
The DPCH reception sections 400-1 to 400-K perform<br>
the same operations, and therefore only the DPCH reception<br>
section 400-1 will be explained below. The despreading<br>
section 410 of the DPCH reception section 4C0-1 applies<br>
despreading processing to the received signal using the<br>
spreading code assigned to the uplink DPCH of the mobile<br>
station 1. The demodulation section 420 demodulates the<br>
despread signal such as QPSK. The demodulated signal is<br>
input to the decoding section 4 30 and SIR measuring section<br>
440. The decoding section 430 carries out a forward error<br>
correction and CRC on the demodulated received signal<br>
of the DPCH and decodes the received signal of the DPCH.<br>
In this way, the received data (bit string) of the DPCH<br>
is obtained. The received data of the DPCH is input to<br>
the TPC command extraction section 450. The TPC command<br>
extraction section 450 extracts the TPC command for the<br>
downlink S-CCPCH and the TPC command for the downlink<br>
DPCH placed in the time slot of the received data of the<br>
DPCH. The extracted TPC command for the downlink S-CCPCH<br>
is input to the TPC command selection section 35. That<br>
is, the TPC command selection section 35 receives the<br>
TPC commands for the downlink S-CCPCH from the respective<br>
TPC command extraction sections 450 of the DPSH reception<br>
sections 400-1 to 400-K. Furthermore, the extracted TPC<br>
command for the downlink DPCH is input to the power control<br>
section 640 of the DPCH transmission section 600-1. The<br>
SIR measuring section 440 measures the reception SIR of<br>
the DPCH. The measured SIR is input to the "PC command<br>
creation section 460. The TPC command creation section<br>
460 compares the reception SIR of the DPCH with a target<br>
SIR for the DPCH and creates a TPC command for the uplink<br>
DPCH based on the comparison result. When the measured<br>
SIR is equal to or greater than the target SIR, a TPC<br>
command instructing "Down" is created and when the<br>
measured SIR is less than the target SIR, a TPC command<br>
instructing "Up" is created. The created TPC command for<br>
the uplink DPCH is input to the encoding section 610 of<br>
the DPCH transmission section 600-1.<br>
The TPC command selection section 35 compares a<br>
plurality of TPC commands for the downlink S-CCPCH input<br>
from the DPCH reception sections 400-1 to 400-K. Then,<br>
if there is at least one TPC command instructing "Up"<br>
among those TPC commands, the TPC command instructing<br>
"Up" is selected and input to the power control section<br>
540. On the other hand, if all the TPC commands instruct<br>
"Down", the TPC command instructing "Down" is selected<br>
and input to the power control section 540.<br>
The encoding section 510 of the S-CCPCH transmission<br>
section 500 carries out convolution coding and CRC coding<br>
on the transmission data (bit string) of the S-CCPCH,<br>
encodes the transmission data of the S-CCPCH and<br>
constructs a transmission frame composed of a plurality<br>
of time slots. The modulation section 520 applies<br>
modulation processing such as QPSK :o the transmission<br>
data. The spreading section 530 applies spreading<br>
processing to the modulated transmission signal using<br>
the spreading code assigned to the downlink S-CCPCH. The<br>
transmit power of the transmission signal after the<br>
spreading is controlled by the power control section 540<br>
according to the TPC command selected by the TPC command<br>
selection section 35. Therefore, if there is at least<br>
one TPC command instructing "Up" among a plurality of<br>
K TPC commands for the downlink S-CCPCH transmitted from<br>
the plurality of mobile stations 1 to K, the transmit<br>
power of the downlink S-CCPCH is increased and if all<br>
the K TPC commands are TPC commands instructing "Down",<br>
the transmit power of the downlink S-CCPCH is decreased.<br>
That is, the transmit power of the downlink S-CCPCH is<br>
the same for all mobile stations. The downlink S-CCPCH<br>
signal after transmit power control is input to the<br>
transmission RF section 40.<br>
The operations of the DPCH transmission sections<br>
600-1 to 600-K are the same, and therefore only the DPCH<br>
transmission section 600-1 will be explained. The<br>
encoding section 610 of the DPCH transmission section<br>
600-1 carries out convolution coding and CRC coding on<br>
the transmission data (bit string) of the DPCH directed<br>
to the mobile station 1, encodes ths transmission data<br>
of the DPCH and constructs a transmission frame composed<br>
of a plurality of time slots. The modulation section 620<br>
applies modulation processing such as CPSK to the<br>
transmission data. The spreading section 630 applies<br>
spreading processing to the modulated transmission signal<br>
using the spreading code assigned to the downlink DPCH<br>
of the mobile station 1 . The transmit power of the spread<br>
transmission signal is controlled by the power control<br>
section 640 according to the TPC command for the downlink<br>
DPCH extracted by the TPC command extraction section 450.<br>
Therefore, the transmit power of the downlink DPCH is<br>
individually controlled for each mobile station. The<br>
downlink DPCH signal after the transmit power control<br>
is input to the transmission RF section 40.<br>
The transmission RF section 40 carries out<br>
processing such as D/A conversion and up-conversion on<br>
the S-CCPCH transmission signal after the transmit power<br>
control and the DPCH transmission signal after the<br>
transmit power control, and then transmits the respective<br>
transmission signals from the antenna 25 to the mobile<br>
stations 1 to K through the downlink S-CCPCH and downlink<br>
DPCH's .<br>
Then, the method of arranging TPC commands at the<br>
mobile station will be explained using FIG.4 to FIG.6.<br>
In FIG.4 to FIG.6, an example where one frame consists<br>
of 8 time slots (TS#1 to TS#8) is shown for convenience<br>
of explanation, but one frame actually consists of 15<br>
time slots.<br>
As shown in FIG.4, the mobile station arranges TPC<br>
commands for the downlink S-CCPCH instead of TPC commands<br>
for the downlink DPCH at a rate of once for every several<br>
time slots. For example, the mobile station arranges a<br>
TPC command for the downlink S-CCPCH once, while it<br>
arranges a TPC command for the downlink DPCH twice. That<br>
is, the transmission interval of TPC commands for the<br>
downlink S-CCPCH is designed to be longer than the<br>
transmission interval of TPC commands for the downlink<br>
DPCH. Furthermore, in the example shown in FIG.4, the<br>
number of times TPC commands for the downlink S-CCPCH<br>
are transmitted is smaller than the number of times TPC<br>
commands for the downlink DPCH are transmitted in one<br>
frame. Furthermore, in the example in FIG.4, the TPC<br>
commands for the downlink S-CCPCH are arranged in the<br>
time slots different from those in which the TPC commands<br>
for the downlink DPCH are arranged.<br>
Furthermore, as shown in FIG.5, a TPC command for<br>
the downlink S-CCPCH is arranged in parallel to a TPC<br>
command for the downlink DPCH within one time slot. That<br>
is, both the TPC command for the downlink DPCH and TPC<br>
command for the downlink S-CCPCH are transmitted in the<br>
same time slot. Furthermore, both TPC commands for the<br>
downlink DPCH and TPC commands for the downlink S-CCPCH<br>
are arranged in all time slots. Therefore, in this<br>
example, the transmission interval of TPC commands for<br>
the downlink S-CCPCH and the transmission interval of<br>
TPC commands for the downlink DPCH are the same.<br>
Furthermore, the number of times TPC commands for the<br>
downlink S-CCPCH are transmitted is the same as the number<br>
of times TPC commands for the downlink DPCH are transmitted<br>
in one frame.<br>
Furthermore, as shown in FIG. 6, time slots including<br>
both TPC command for the downlink DPCH and TPC command<br>
for the downlink S-CCPCH and time slots including only<br>
a TPC command for the downlink DPCH are provided in one<br>
frame. In this example, the transmission interval of TPC<br>
commands for the downlink S-CCPCH is also longer than<br>
the transmission interval of TPC commands for the downlink<br>
DPCH. Furthermore, within one frame, the number of times<br>
TPC commands for the downlink S-CCPCH are transmitted<br>
is smaller than the number of times TFC commands for the<br>
downlink DPCH are transmitted.<br>
The mobile station transmits both the TPC commands<br>
for the downlink DPCH and TPC commands for the downlink<br>
S-CCPCH arranged in this way to the base station through<br>
the uplink DPCH.<br>
Then, the transmit power control according to this<br>
embodiment will be explained using FIG.7. In FIG.7, DPCH1<br>
denotes a DPCH assigned to the mobile station 1 and DPCH2<br>
denotes a DPCH assigned to the mobile station 2.<br>
Now, for example, the mobile station 1 transmits<br>
a TPC command for the DPCH1 instructing "Down" of the<br>
downlink DPCH1 and a TPC command for the S-CCPCH<br>
instructing "Down" of the downlink S-CCPCH to the base<br>
station through the uplink DPCH1. Furthermore, the<br>
mobile station 2 transmits a TPC command for the DPCH2<br>
instructing "Up" of the downlink DPCH2 and a TPC command<br>
for the S-CCPCH instructing "Up" of the downlink S-CCPCH<br>
to the base station through the uplink DPCH2.<br>
The base station receives a signal including both<br>
TPC command for the DPCH1 and TPC command for the S-CCPCH<br>
from the mobile station 1 through the uplink DPCH1.<br>
Furthermore, the base station receives a signal including<br>
both the TPC command for the DPCH2 and TPC command for<br>
the S-CCPCH from the mobile station 2 through the uplink<br>
DPCH2 . Then, the base station controls the transmit power<br>
of the downlink DPCHl according to the TPC command for<br>
the DPCH1 transmitted from the mobile station 1. That<br>
is, the base station decreases the transmit power of the<br>
downlink DPCH1 . Furthermore, the base station controls<br>
the transmit power of the downlink DPCH2 according to<br>
the TPC command for the DPCH2 transmitted from the mobile<br>
station 2. That is the base station increases the<br>
transmit power of the downlink DPCH2.<br>
On the other hand, with regard to the downlink<br>
S-CCPCH, when either one of the TPC command for the S-CCPCH<br>
transmitted from the mobile station 1 or the TPC command<br>
for the S-CCPCH transmitted from the mobile station 2<br>
is a TPC command instructing "Up", the base station<br>
increases the transmit power of the downlink S-CCPCH.<br>
Furthermore, when both the TPC command for the S-CCPCH<br>
transmitted from the mobile station 1 and the TPC command<br>
for the S-CCPCH transmitted from the mobile station 2<br>
are TPC commands instructing "Down", the base station<br>
decreases the transmit power of the downlink S-CCPCH.<br>
Therefore, in the example shown in FIG.7, the base station<br>
increases the transmit power of the downlink S-CCPCH.<br>
Through such transmit power control over the S-CCPCH,<br>
the transmit power of the S-CCPCH is controlled in such<br>
a way that the reception SIR of the S-CCPCH is kept at<br>
a target SIR at the mobile station located farthest from<br>
the base station in the cell. That is, it is possible<br>
to control the transmit power of the S-CCPCH to minimum<br>
necessary transmit power and consequently make the<br>
transmit power of the S-CCPCH smaller than the<br>
conventional transmit power.<br>
By carrying out transmit power control over the<br>
downlink DPCH concurrently with transmit power control<br>
over the downlink S-CCPCH, it is possible to comparatively<br>
increase transmit power available to other channels such<br>
as DPCH as compared to the prior art (FIG.1) and increase<br>
the other channel capacity such as DPCH. Furthermore,<br>
it is possible to reduce interference with other cells<br>
and consequently prevent the system capacity from<br>
reducing.<br>
(Embodiment 2)<br>
This embodiment controls transmit power of a<br>
downlink S-CCPCH to power equal to transmit power of a<br>
downlink DPCH under transmit power control according to<br>
a TPC command or power with an addition of an offset.<br>
FIG.8 is a block diagram showing a configuration<br>
of a mobile station according to Embodiment 2 of thepresent<br>
invention. The same components as those of Embodiment<br>
1 (FIG.2) are assigned the same reference numerals and<br>
explanations thereof will be omitted. The mobile station<br>
shown in FIG.8 adopts a configuration with the SIR<br>
measuring section 140 and TPC command creation section<br>
150 omitted from the S-CCPCH reception section 100 of<br>
the mobile station shown in FIG.2. That is,in the mobile<br>
station shown in FIG.8, no TPC command for the downlink<br>
S-CCPCH is created and only TPC commands for the downlink<br>
DPCH are input from a TPC command creation section 260<br>
of a DPCH reception section 200 to an encoding section<br>
310. Therefore, TPC commands for the downlink DPCH are<br>
transmitted to a base station, but no TPC command for<br>
the downlink S-CCPCH is transmitted.<br>
FIG.9 is a block diagram showing a configuration<br>
of a base station according to Embodiment 2 of the present<br>
invention. The base station shown in FIG.9 adopts a<br>
configuration with the TPC command selection section 35<br>
omitted and a transmit power selection section 45 and<br>
an offset section 50 added to Embodiment 1 (FIG.3). The<br>
same components as those in Embodiment 1 (FIG.3) are<br>
assigned the same reference numerals and explanations<br>
thereof will be omitted.<br>
In a DPCH reception section 400-1 of the base station<br>
shown in FIG.9, a TPC command extraction section 450<br>
extracts TPC commands for the downlink DPCH arranged in<br>
time slots of the DPCH received data. The extracted TPC<br>
commands for the downlink DPCH are input to a power control<br>
section 640 of a DPCH transmission section 600-1. The<br>
transmit power of a transmission signal spread by a<br>
spreading section 630 is controlled by the power control<br>
section 640 according to the TPC command for the downlink<br>
DPCH extracted by the TPC command extraction section 450.<br>
Therefore, the transmit power of the downlink DPCH is<br>
controlled individually for each mobile station as in<br>
the case of Embodiment 1. The downlink DPCH signal after<br>
the transmit power control is input to a transmission<br>
RF section 40. The power control section 640 inputs the<br>
transmit power value of the downlink DPCH after the<br>
transmit power control to the transmit power selection<br>
section 45. That is, transmit power values of the<br>
downlink DPCH are input from the respective power control<br>
sections 640 of the DPCH transmission sections 600-1 to<br>
600-K to the transmit power selection section 45.<br>
The transmit power selection section 45 selects the<br>
largest transmit power value from the plurality of input<br>
transmit power values and inputs the selected value to<br>
the offset section 50. The offset section 50 inputs the<br>
transmit power value input from the transmit power<br>
selection section 45 with an addition of an offset to<br>
a power control section 540 of an S-CCPCH transmission<br>
section 500. The power control section 540 controls the<br>
transmit power of the downlink S-CCPCH to a transmit power<br>
value that includes this offset. That is, the transmit<br>
power value of the downlink S-CCPCH is controlled to a<br>
value obtained by adding the offset to the maximum transmit<br>
power value of the plurality of transmit power values<br>
of the downlink DPCH's after transmit power control.<br>
Note that it is also possible to omit the offset<br>
section 50 from the configuration shown in FIG.9 and<br>
directly input the transmit power value selected by the<br>
transmit power selection section 45 to the power control<br>
section 540 of the S-CCPCH transmission section 500. By<br>
so doing, the power control section 540 controls the<br>
transmit power value of the downlink S-CCPCH to a value<br>
equal to the maximum transmit power value of the plurality<br>
of transmit power values of the downlink DPCH's after<br>
transmit power control.<br>
Then, transmit power control according to this<br>
embodiment will be explained using FIG.1C. Now, for<br>
example, the mobile station 1 transmits a TPC command<br>
for the DPCH1 instructing "Down" of the downlink DPCH1<br>
to the base station through the uplink DPCH1 and the mobile<br>
station 2 transmits a TPC command for the DPCH2 instructing<br>
"Up" of the downlink DPCH2 to the base station through<br>
the DPCH2.<br>
The base station receives a signal including a TPC<br>
command for the DPCH1 from the mobile station 1 through<br>
the uplink DPCH1 . The base station further receives a<br>
signal including a TPC command for the DPCH2 from the<br>
mobile station 2 through the uplink DPCH2. Then, the<br>
transmit power of the downlink DPCH1 is controlled<br>
according to the TPC command for the DPCH1 transmitted<br>
from the mobile station 1. That is, the transmit power<br>
of the downlink DPCH1 is decreased. Furthermore, the<br>
transmit power of the downlink DPCH2 is controlled<br>
according to the TPC command for the DPCH2 transmitted<br>
from the mobile station 2. That is, the transmit power<br>
of the downlink DPCH2 is increased.<br>
Now, the mobile station 2 is located farther from<br>
the base station than the mobile station 1, and therefore<br>
the downlink DPCH2 has greater transmit power than the<br>
downlink DPCH1 . Therefore, the base station controls the<br>
transmit power of the downlink S-CCPCH at a value of the<br>
transmit power of the downlink DPCH2 with an addition<br>
of an offset or at a value equal to the transmit power<br>
of the downlink DPCH2. FIG. 10 shows a case where an offset<br>
is added.<br>
Thus, by equalizing the transmit power of the S-CCPCH<br>
with the transmit power of the downlink DPCH for the mobile<br>
station located farthest from the base station in the<br>
cell, it is possible to control the transmit power of<br>
the S-CCPCH to minimum necessary power for all mobile<br>
stations in the cell to receive . As a result, the transmit<br>
power of the S-CCPCH can be reduced compared the<br>
conventional case. Furthermore, adding an offset can<br>
provide a margin for the transmit power of the S-CCPCH.<br>
Thus, as in the case of Embodiment 1, carrying out<br>
transmit power control over the downlink DPCH<br>
concurrently with transmit power control over the<br>
downlink S-CCPCH makes it possible to comparatively<br>
increase the transmit power available to other channels<br>
such as DPCH as compared to the conventional case (FIG.1)<br>
and increase capacities of other channels such as DPCH.<br>
Furthermore, it is possible to reduce interference with<br>
other cells and consequently prevent the system capacity<br>
from reducing.<br>
(Embodiment 3)<br>
This embodiment controls the amount of the offset<br>
according to Embodiment 2.<br>
FIG.11 is a block diagram showing a configuration<br>
of a mobile station according to Embodiment 3 of thepresent<br>
invention. The same components as those in Embodiment<br>
2 (FIG.8) are assigned the same reference numerals and<br>
explanations thereof will be omitted. The mobile station<br>
shown in FIG.11 adopts a configuration with a response<br>
signal creation section 160 added to the S-CCPCH reception<br>
section 100 of the mobile station shown in FIG.8.<br>
A decoding section 130 of the S-CCPCH reception<br>
section 100 inputs a CRC result of the S-CCPCH, that is,<br>
CRC=OK (no error) or CRC = NG (error found) to the response<br>
signal creation section 160. When CRC=OK is input, the<br>
response signal creation section 160 creates an ACK<br>
(Acknowledgement: positive response) signal and inputs<br>
the ACK signal to an encoding section 310. On the other<br>
hand, when CRC=NG is input, the response signal creation<br>
section 160 creates a NACK (Negative Acknowledgement:<br>
negative response) signal and inputs the NACK signal to<br>
the encoding section 310. The encoding section 310<br>
encodes the ACK signal or NACK signal in addition to the<br>
processing of Embodiment 2 and then places the signal<br>
in a predetermined time slot. Then, the ACK signal or<br>
NACK signal for the downlink S-CCPCE is transmitted to<br>
a base station through the uplink DPCH as shown in FIG. 12.<br>
When no uplink DPCH is set, the mobile station may also<br>
transmit the ACK signal or NACK signal for the downlink<br>
S-CCPCH through an uplink PRACH (Physical Random Access<br>
Channel) instead of the uplink DPCH.<br>
FIG.13 is a block diagram showing a configuration<br>
of a base station according to Embodiment 3 of the present<br>
invention. The base station shown in FIG.13 adopts a<br>
configuration with an offset control section 55 and a<br>
response signal extraction section 470 in the DPCH<br>
reception sections 4 0 0-1 to 400-K added to the base station<br>
shown in Embodiment 2 (FIG. 9). In FIG. 13, the same<br>
components as those in FIG.9 are assigned the same<br>
reference numerals and explanations thereof will be<br>
omitted.<br>
A decoding section 430 inputs received data of the<br>
DPCH to a TPC command extraction section 450 and the<br>
response signal extraction section 470. The response<br>
signal extraction section 470 extracts an ACK signal or<br>
NACK signal placed in a predetermined time slot of the<br>
received data of the DPCH. The extracted ACK signal or<br>
NACK signal of the downlink S-CCPCH is input to the offset<br>
control section 55. That is, the offset control section<br>
55 receives the ACK signal or NACK signal of the downlink<br>
S-CCPCH from the respective response signal extraction<br>
sections 470 of the DPCH reception sections 400-1 to 400-K.<br>
When a NACK signal is input a plurality of N times<br>
consecutively any of mobile station 1 to mobile station<br>
K (that is, when the base station receives a NACK signal<br>
for any mobile station a plurality of times consecutively) ,<br>
the offset control section 55 decides that the transmit<br>
power of the downlink S-CCPCH falls short and increases<br>
the amount of offset added by the offset section 50 by<br>
a predetermined amount (e.g., 1 dB) . On the other hand,<br>
when an ACK signal is input for any of mobile stations<br>
1 to mobile station K a plurality of M times consecutively<br>
(that is, the base station receives an ACK signal for<br>
any mobile station a plurality of times consecutively),<br>
the offset control section 55 decides that the transmit<br>
power of the downlink S-CCPCH is excessive and reduces<br>
the amount of offset added by the offset section 50 by<br>
a predetermined amount (e.g., 0.5 cB) .<br>
Thus, by controlling the amount of offset, it is<br>
furthermore possible to set an appropriate amount of<br>
offset in addition to the effect of Embodiment 2 and carry<br>
out more appropriate transmit power control on the<br>
downlink S-CCPCH.<br>
This embodiment can also be adapted in such a way<br>
that the mobile station does not transmit any ACK signal<br>
when CRC=OK and transmits a NACK signal only when CRC=NG.<br>
In this case, the base station increases the amount of<br>
offset when a NACK signal is received and decreases the<br>
amount of offset when neither ACK signal nor NACK signal<br>
is received.<br>
(Embodiment 4)<br>
This embodiment increases transmit power of the<br>
S-CCPCH by an amount requested by a mobile station.<br>
FIG.14 is a block diagram showing a configuration<br>
of a mobile station according to Embodiment 4 of thepresent<br>
invention. The same components as those in Embodiment<br>
1 (FIG.2) are assigned the same reference numerals and<br>
explanations thereof will be omitted. The mobile station<br>
shown in FIG. 14 adopts a configuration with the TPC command<br>
creation section 150 omitted and an SIR comparison section<br>
170 and a request signal creation section 160 added to<br>
the S-CCPCH reception section 100 of the mobile station<br>
shown in FIG.2.<br>
An SIR measuring section 140 of the S-CCPCH reception<br>
section 100 measures a reception SIR of the S-CCPCH and<br>
inputs the measured SIR to the SIR comparison section<br>
170. Suppose the input SIR is an average (average SIR)<br>
of a plurality of predetermined slots (N slots). The SIR<br>
comparison section 170 compares the input average SIR<br>
with a target SIR and inputs the difference between the<br>
target SIR and average SIR to the request signal creation<br>
section 180 only when the average SIR is less than the<br>
target SIR. The request signal creation section 180 takes<br>
this difference as an amount of increase, creates a request<br>
signal (bit string) for requesting an increase of the<br>
transmit power of the S-CCPCH and inputs it to an encoding<br>
section 310. The encoding section 310 encodes the request<br>
signal in addition to the processing of Embodiment 2 and<br>
then places the request signal in a predetermined time<br>
slot. Then, the request signal for the downlink S-CCPCH<br>
is transmitted to a base station through the uplink DPCH<br>
as shown in FIG. 15. Note that when no uplink DPCH is set,<br>
the mobile station can also transmit a request signal<br>
for the downlink S-CCPCH through an uplink PRACH instead<br>
of the uplink DPCH.<br>
FIG.16 is a block diagram showing a configuration<br>
of the base station according to Embodiment 4 of thepresent<br>
invention. The base station shown in FIG.16 adopts a<br>
configuration with the TPC command selection section 35<br>
omitted and a request signal extraction section 480 added<br>
to the DPCH reception sections 400-1 to 400-K compared<br>
to Embodiment 1 (FIG.3). The same components as those<br>
in Embodiment 1 (FIG.3) are assigned, the same reference<br>
numerals and explanations thereof will be omitted.<br>
A decoding section 430 inputs received data of the<br>
DPCH to a TPC command extraction section 450 and the request<br>
signal extraction section 480. The request signal<br>
extraction section 480 extracts a request signal placed<br>
in a predetermined time slot of the received data of the<br>
DPCH. The extracted request signal is input to a power<br>
control section 540 of an S-CCPCH transmission section<br>
500. That is, the power control section 540 receives<br>
request signals for the downlink S-CCPCH from the<br>
respective request signal extraction sections 480 of the<br>
DPCH reception sections 400-1 to 400-K.<br>
The power control section 540 changes the transmit<br>
power of the S-CCPCH in a certainperiod as shown in FIG. 17 .<br>
When a plurality of request signals is input during one<br>
period (that is, when request signals are transmitted<br>
from a plurality of mobile stations or a plurality of<br>
request signals is transmitted from one mobile station),<br>
the transmit power of the S-CCPCH is increased by the<br>
maximum amount of increase of the amount of increase of<br>
the transmit power shown by those request signals. For<br>
example, when request signals are transmitted from the<br>
mobile station 1 and mobile station 2 in period 1 as shown<br>
in FIG.17, the transmit power of the S-CCPCH is increased<br>
by the requested maximum amount of increase of X dB at<br>
a change timing 1. On the other hand, when no request<br>
signal is input in one period (that is, no request signal<br>
is transmitted from either of the mobile stations), the<br>
transmit power of the S-CCPCH is decreased by a<br>
predetermined amount of Y dB (e.g., Y = 0.1 dB) . For<br>
example, as shown in FIG.17, when neither, mobile station<br>
1 nor mobile station 2 transmits a request signal in period<br>
2, the transmit power of the S-CCPCH is decreased by Y<br>
dB at a change timing 2. Thus, bycontrolling the transmit<br>
power of the S-CCPCH, it is possible to control the transmit<br>
power of the S-CCPCH to minimum necessary power for all<br>
the mobile stations in the cell to receive. As a result,<br>
it is possible to reduce the transmit power of the S-CCPCH<br>
compared to the conventional case.<br>
Thus, by carrying out transmit power control over<br>
the downlink DPCH concurrently with transmit power<br>
control over the downlink S-CCPCH, it is possible to<br>
comparatively increase the transmit power available to<br>
other channels such as DPCH as compared to the conventional<br>
case ( FIG . 1) as in the cases of Embodiment 1 and Embodiment<br>
2 and thereby increase capacities of other channels such<br>
as DPCH. It is also possible to reduce interference with<br>
other cells and consequently prevent the system capacity<br>
from reducing.<br>
As explained above, the present invention can<br>
control the transmit power of an MBMS common channel<br>
appropriately in such a way that the transmit power does<br>
not become excessive.<br>

dedicated channel based on said second TPC command,<br>
wherein said first control section increases the transmit power of the<br>
downlink common channel when at least one of a plurality of first TPC<br>
commands transmitted from the plurality of mobile stations is a TPC<br>
command instructing an increase of the transmit power and decreases the<br>
transmit power of the downlink common channel when all of said plurality<br>
of first TPC commands transmitted from said plurality of mobile stations<br>
are TPC commands instructing a decreases of the transmit power.<br>
4. A base station apparatus carrying out a transmit power control over a<br>
downlink common channel used to simultaneously transmit same data to<br>
a plurality of mobile station concurrently with a transmit power control<br>
over downlink dedicated channels assigned individually to said plurality of<br>
mobile stations, comprising :<br>
a reception section that receives a TPC command for the downlink<br>
dedicated channel through an uplink dedicated channel and receives an<br>
ACK signal or a NACK signal for the downlink common channel through<br>
the uplink dedicated channel or an uplink random access channel;<br>
a first control section that controls a transmit power of the downlink<br>
dedicated channel based on said TPC command; and<br>
a second control section that controls a transmit power of the downlink<br>
common channel at a maximum transmit power in a plurality of transmit<br>
powers of the downlink dedicated channels after transmit power control<br>
with an addition of an offset,<br>
wherein said second control section decreases said offset when the ACK<br>
signal is received a plurality of times consecutively and increases said<br>
offset when the NACK signal is received a plurality of times consecutively.<br>
5. A transmit power controlling method substantially as herein described with<br>
reference to the accompanying drawings.<br>
6. A base station apparatus substantially as herein described with reference<br>
to the accompanying drawings.<br>
In order to control the transmission power of the common channel for the MBMS<br>
(multimedia Broadcast/Multicast Service) so that it will not be excessive, a mobile<br>
station (1) transmits a TPC command for the S-CCPCH via an upstream DPCH1 to<br>
the base station and a mobile station (2) transmits a TPC command for the S-<br>
CCPCH via an upstream DPCH2 to the base station. When one of the TPC<br>
command for the S-CCPCH transmitted from the mobile station (1) and the TPC<br>
command for the S-CPCH transmitted from the mobile station (2) is a TPC<br>
command indicating Up, the base station increase the transmission power of the<br>
downstream S-CCPCH. When both of them are TPC commands indicating Down,<br>
the base station lowers the transmission power of the downstream S-CPCH.</td>
