Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a dispenser for dispensing a metered<br>
volume of a fluid product and is particularly, but not exclusively, concerned with a<br>
dispenser for dispensing a metered volume of a fluid medicament, for instance<br>
medicaments having liquid, gaseous, powder or topical (cream, paste etc.)<br>
formulations. The invention also has application in the area of consumer<br>
healthcare, as in the case of toothpaste, sun cream lotion etc.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Fluid product dispensers having metering mechanisms are known in the art.<br>
As an example, in the medical field the use of metered dose inhalers (MDIs) is well<br>
established. In a MDI, the fluid product is contained under pressure in a canister<br>
having an open end closed off by a valve mechanism. The valve mechanism has<br>
a valve body which defines a fixed volume metering chamber through which a<br>
valve stem is sealingly slidable between filling and discharging positions. In the<br><br>
filling position, the valve stem places the metering chamber in fluid communication<br>
with the canister contents, but isolates the metering chamber from the external<br>
environment. Conversely, when the valve stem is moved to the discharge<br>
position, the metering chamber is placed in fluid communication with the external<br>
environment, but isolated from the canister contents. In this way, a metered<br>
volume of fluid product is sequentially transferred to the metering chamber and<br>
then discharged to the external environment for inhalation by a patient.<br>
The present invention provides a dispenser for a fluid product having a<br>
novel dispensing mechanism.<br>

Detailed Description of the Exemplary Embodiments of the Invention<br>
FIGURES 1 to 3 show a fluid dispenser 1 in accordance with the present<br>
invention whose underlying principle of operation is as described and claimed in<br>
International patent application Nos. PCT/EP03/08646 and PCT/EP03/08647, the<br>
entire contents of each of which are hereby incorporated herein by reference.<br>
The fluid dispenser 1 has an outer casing 3 comprising first and second<br>
outer casing halves 5a, 5b. The outer casing 3 is assembled through the inter-<br>
engagement of complementary male and female connectors 7a, 7b formed on the<br>
inner surfaces 9a, 9b of the outer casing halves 5a, 5b. In this particular<br>
embodiment, the male connectors 7a are pegs and the female connectors 7b are<br>
apertures into which the pegs are slidably receivable.<br>
The outer casing 3 is preferably made from a plastics material, for instance<br>
by moulding. Most preferably, the outer casing is made from acrylonitrile-<br>
butadiene-styrene (ABS).<br>
As indicated by the broken line in FIGURE 2A, the outer casing 3 of the fluid<br>
dispenser 1 is held in the hand H of a human user when operating the fluid<br><br>
dispenser 1. The user's hand H which holds the outer casing 3 is also able to be<br>
used to actuate the fluid dispenser 1, as will be understood further hereinafter.<br>
The outer casing halves 5a, 5b have a shell-like form whereby when<br>
assembled they enclose an internal chamber 11. As will be understood by<br>
reference to FIGURE 1, for example, at an upper end 13 of the outer casing 3<br>
there is a passageway 15 to the internal chamber 11 bounded by concave<br>
recesses 17a, 17b in the outer casing halves 5a, 5b. The passageway 15 is co-<br>
axially arranged with a longitudinal axis X-X of the fluid dispenser 1 and has a<br>
generally circular lateral cross section.<br>
The passageway 15 receives a nozzle 19 of the fluid dispenser 1, which in<br>
this embodiment is shaped and sized for insertion into a nostril of a human user<br>
(i.e. a nasal nozzle). Thus, the fluid dispenser 1 is an intra-nasal fluid dispenser.<br>
To this end, the nasal nozzle 19 in this particular embodiment has an outer surface<br>
20 which has a generally circular lateral cross section and which curves laterally<br>
inwardly in the upward direction denoted by arrow U.<br>
The nasal nozzle 19 is preferably made from a plastics material, for<br>
instance from polypropylene (PP), and may, for example, be formed by moulding.<br>
As will be seen from FIGURES 2A and 3, the nasal nozzle 19 is axially<br>
aligned with the longitudinal axis X-X and has a longitudinal bore 21 to direct the<br>
liquid dispensed from the dispenser 1 in the upward direction U along the<br>
longitudinal axis X-X. The nasal nozzle 19 has a generally cylindrical, open-ended<br>
inner tubular section 23 whose inner circumferential surface 25 defines the nozzle<br>
bore 21. Moreover, the tubular section 23 provides an upper opening 27 of the<br>
nozzle bore 21 which is the outlet orifice of the fluid dispenser 1.<br>
As will be appreciated, the nasal nozzle 19 can be of other shapes and<br>
configurations suited for insertion into a human nostril.<br><br>
A generally cylindrical valve body 28 of a one-way (non-return), poppet-type<br>
outlet valve 30 is fixedly, sealingly secured on an outer circumferential surface 29<br>
of the nozzle inner tubular section 23 at its lower end 31 so that a lateral lower end<br>
wall 34 of the generally U-shaped valve body 28 is disposed underneath a lower<br>
opening 32 of the nozzle bore 21. The lateral lower end wall 34 of the valve body<br>
28 includes a valve opening 33 and an outlet valve control member 35 operates in<br>
use to selectively place the outlet valve opening 33 and the nozzle bore 21 in flow<br>
communication so that a metered volume (metered dose) of the liquid 2 is able to<br>
flow through the outlet valve 30 into the nozzle bore 21, as will be described in<br>
more detail hereinafter.<br>
The outlet valve control member 35 has a generally cylindrical, tubular stem<br>
which is open at its upper end and closed by a flange plate at its lower end. One<br>
or more apertures 40 are provided in the tubular stem. The tubular stem is<br>
sealingly, slidably mounted in the lower opening 32 of the nozzle bore 21. The<br>
outlet valve control member 35 is biased by an outlet valve return spring 38,<br>
preferably integrally formed with the outlet valve control member 35, to a rest<br>
position in which the flange plate of the outlet valve control member 35 sealingly<br>
closes the valve opening 33 by seating on a valve seat 36, as shown in FIGURE<br>
2A.<br>
During actuation of the fluid dispenser 1, the outlet valve control member 35<br>
is lifted off the valve seat 36 to place the valve opening 33 in flow communication<br>
with the nozzle bore 21 through the one or more apertures 40 in the tubular stem<br>
of the outlet valve control member 35, as will be described in more detail<br>
hereinafter, particularly with reference to FIGURE 3.<br>
The components 28,35 of the metering valve 30 may be made from<br>
polypropylene (PP), for example by moulding.<br>
As shown in FIGURES 1 and 3, for example, the valve body 28 has an<br>
outer circumferential surface 37 on which is provided upper and lower sealing<br><br>
rings 39, 41. The upper and lower sealing rings 39, 41 may be integrally formed<br>
with the valve body 28 or be separate valve components.<br>
As will be observed from a comparison of FIGURES 2A and 2B with<br>
FIGURES 2C to 2E, a generally U-shaped sliding member 43 is sealingly, slidably<br>
mounted on the outer circumferential surface 37 of the U-shaped valve body 28 for<br>
reciprocation along the longitudinal axis X-X between upper and lower positions<br>
relative to the U-shaped valve body 28. More particularly, the U-shaped sliding<br>
member 43 has a generally circular, longitudinal side wall 45 having an inner<br>
circumferential surface 47 which sealingly slides over the upper and lower sealing<br>
rings 39, 41 on the valve body 28. The U-shaped sliding member 43 further has a<br>
lateral lower end wall 49 which, in the upper position, abuts with the lateral lower<br>
end wall 34 of the valve body 28 (see e.g. FIGURES 2A, 2B and 2F to 21), and<br>
which, in the lower position (FIGURES 2D and 2E), is spaced downwardly from the<br>
lateral lower end wall 34 of the valve body 28. It can therefore be seen that the U-<br>
shaped valve body 28 and the U-shaped sliding member 43 are arranged in a<br>
nesting configuration.<br>
The longitudinal side wall 45 of the U-shaped sliding member 43 has an<br>
outwardly extending connector flange 51 at an intermediate position of its outer<br>
circumferential surface 53. As best illustrated in FIGURES 2B and 3, four equi-<br>
angularly spaced transfer ports 55a, 55b (only two shown) extend laterally through<br>
the longitudinal side wall 45 of the U-shaped sliding member 43 at a position below<br>
the connector flange 51. Of course, the number of transfer ports can be<br>
decreased or increased as desired.<br>
In this embodiment, the U-shaped sliding member 43 is made from a<br>
plastics material, e.g. by moulding. A preferred plastics material is polypropylene<br>
(PP).<br>
A generally cylindrical, liquid-containing hollow container 57 is affixed to the<br>
U-shaped sliding member 43 so as to reciprocate therewith on the longitudinal axis<br>
X-X. In particular, the container 57 has an open-ended container body 56 having a<br><br>
generally U-shaped head 59 at an upper end 61 which nests with the U-shaped<br>
sliding member 43 to be fixedly, sealingly engaged with the connector flange 51 of<br>
the U-shaped sliding member 43, e.g. by adherence therebetween. As further<br>
best shown in FIGURES 2B and 3, the connection is such that the lower section<br>
60 of the outer circumferential surface 53 of the U-shaped sliding member 43,<br>
which is below the connector flange 51, is spaced laterally inwardly of the inner<br>
circumferential surface 62 of the U-shaped container head 59 so as to form an<br>
annular channel 64 therebetween, which is sealingly closed off at the upper end 61<br>
by the connector flange 51 and into which the transfer ports 55a, 55b open.<br>
The container body 56 further has an enlarged hollow base 63 at a lower<br>
end 65 and a hollow neck 67 which extends longitudinally from the base 63 to the<br>
head 59. A sealing piston 69 is sealingly, slidably mounted in the container body<br>
base 63 to sealingly close the container body 56 at the lower end 65.<br>
In this embodiment the container body 56 is made from glass, although, of<br>
course, other inert materials may be used, for example a plastics material, such as<br>
polypropylene (PP). Where the container body 56 is made from a plastics material,<br>
it can be connected to the flange 51 of the plastics U-shaped sliding member 43 by<br>
welding, e.g. by ultrasonic welding.<br>
In this embodiment the sealing piston 69 is made from a plastics material,<br>
e.g. by moulding, and is preferably made from butyl rubber.<br>
In this particular embodiment, the container 57 contains a liquid<br>
medicament formulation.<br>
As will be appreciated by the skilled reader in the art, the lower end of the<br>
annular channel 64 about the U-shaped sliding member 43 is in flow<br>
communication with the inner volume of the container body neck 67 which in turn<br>
is in flow communication with the inner volume of the closed container body base<br>
63. It will therefore be understood that the container 57 co-operates with the<br>
sliding member 43 to define a container inner volume 71 which is only open at the<br><br>
transfer ports 55a, 55b due to the inner volume 71 being sealed by the sealing<br>
piston 69 at the lower end 65 and by the connector flange 51 at the upper end 61.<br>
For convenience, the assembly of the U-shaped sliding member 43 and the<br>
container 57 will now be referred to as the "container unit 58".<br>
Importantly, as will be appreciated by recourse to FIGURES 2C to 2E and<br>
3, the U-shaped sliding member 43 and the lateral lower end wall 34 of the<br>
metering valve body 28 co-operate to define a pumping metering chamber 73<br>
therebetween which is either sealed or selectively open to the transfer ports 55a,<br>
55b or the nozzle bore 21 depending on the sliding position of the container unit 58<br>
on the valve body 28, as will be detailed further hereinafter.<br>
The fluid dispenser 1 is filled with sufficient liquid 2 that, before it is first<br>
used, it completely fills the container inner volume 71, including the annular<br>
channel 64. Moreover, the fluid dispenser operation is such that the container<br>
inner volume 71 is kept airless, i.e. there is no headspace.<br>
As shown in FIGURE 2A, for example, a return spring 75 of compression<br>
type acts on the container base 63 to bias the container unit 58 in the upward<br>
direction U to an upper sliding position in the outer casing 3 in which the U-shaped<br>
sliding member 43 is disposed in its upper position on the valve body 28. As will<br>
be understood more fully shortly hereinafter, the fluid dispenser 1 is adapted so<br>
that, in its rest or non-actuated state, the container unit 58 is placed in the upper<br>
sliding position by the return spring 75.<br>
As illustrated in FIGURES 2A and 2B, for example, the upper sliding<br>
position of the container unit 58 is defined by the abutment of the lateral lower end<br>
wall 49 of the U-shaped sliding member 43 with the lateral lower end wall 34 of the<br>
valve body 28 (i.e. when the U-shaped sliding member 43 is in its upper sliding<br>
position on the valve body 28). It will thus be appreciated that the pumping<br>
metering chamber 73 has no, or substantially no, volume in the rest state of the<br>
fluid dispenser 1. Moreover, in the upper sliding position of the U-shaped member<br>
43 the transfer ports 55a, 55b are disposed in-between the upper and lower<br><br>
sealing rings 39, 41 on the valve body 28. Furthermore, the outlet valve control<br>
member 35 is in its closed position. Consequently, the metering chamber 73 is not<br>
in flow communication with the inner volume counter 71 of the container 57 nor<br>
with the nozzle bore 21. That is to say, the metering chamber 73 is sealed.<br>
Thus, the inner volume 71 of the container unit 58 is completely sealed in<br>
the rest state of the fluid dispenser 1 inasmuch as contaminants, such as air and<br>
moisture, cannot enter the container inner volume 71 at its lower end 65, due to<br>
the sealing piston 69, nor at the upper end 61 by virtue of the position of the<br>
transfer ports 55a, 55b between the sealing rings 39,41, the collapsed state of the<br>
metering chamber 73 and the closed position of the outlet valve control member<br>
35. Of course, it will be appreciated that the components of the fluid dispenser 1<br>
are made from fluid impervious materials.<br>
As will be described in more detail shortly hereinafter, the fluid dispenser 1<br>
is provided with a hand-operable actuating mechanism 100 for reciprocating the<br>
container unit 58 along the longitudinal axis X-X to cause a metered dose of the<br>
liquid 2 to be dispensed.<br>
In broad terms, the actuating mechanism 100 drives the container unit 58<br>
downwardly in the direction of arrow D against the return force of the return spring<br>
75. In so doing, the U-shaped sliding member 43 parts from the valve body 28 so<br>
as to increase the volume of the metering chamber 73, as shown in FIGURES 2C<br>
to 2E. This results in a negative pressure or vacuum being produced in the<br>
metering chamber 73. Eventually, the transfer ports 55a, 55b slide past the lower<br>
sealing ring 41 to place the metering chamber 73 and the container inner volume<br>
71 in flow communication with one another. Liquid from the container 57 is then<br>
drawn into the metering chamber 73 due to the negative pressure created in the<br>
metering chamber 73 during the downward stroke of the container unit 58. In this<br>
regard, the sealing piston 69 slides up in the container base 63, under the<br>
influence of the negative pressure, to decrease the inner volume 71 of the<br>
container 57 by an amount equivalent to the liquid volume transferred into the<br><br>
metering chamber 73. Accordingly, no headspace is generated over the liquid 2 in<br>
the container 57 during the filling of the metering chamber 73.<br>
It is to be noted that the outlet valve control member 35 remains closed in<br>
the downward stroke to prevent escape of any of the liquid 2 transferred into the<br>
metering chamber 73 during this filling mode of operation of the fluid dispenser 1.<br>
Once the downward stroke is completed, and the container unit 58 is at its<br>
lower sliding position shown in FIGURE 2E, the return spring 75 is released to<br>
drive the container unit 58 upwards and to compress the metering chamber 73. To<br>
this end, the hydraulic force needed to cause the sealing piston 69 in the container<br>
base 63 to slide downwards is less than that required to open the outlet valve<br>
control member 35. As a result, during an initial phase of the upward return stroke<br>
of the container unit 58 in the outer casing 3 a proportion of the liquid 2 in the<br>
metering chamber 73 is bled back to the container inner volume 71 via the transfer<br>
ports 55a, 55b resulting in the sealing piston 69 sliding downwardly in the<br>
container base 63. This is the bleed mode of operation of the fluid dispenser 1.<br>
In the bleed mode of operation the sealing piston 69 moves downwardly to<br>
a new rest position which is spaced upwardly of its previous rest position before<br>
the filling mode of operation. The increase in the container inner volume 71 in the<br>
bleed mode is equivalent to the volume of liquid bled back thereinto. Thus, no<br>
headspace is created in the container inner volume 71 in the bleed mode.<br>
At an intermediate sliding position of the container unit 58 during the<br>
upward return stroke, not shown, the transfer ports 55a, 55b are juxtaposed with<br>
the lower sealing ring 41 so as to be closed thereby. At this point in the upward<br>
return stroke no more liquid 2 is able to be bled back to the container 57.<br>
Moreover, the metering chamber 73 now defines the metering volume of the fluid<br>
dispenser 1 and is filled with a metered volume of the liquid 2 transferred thereinto<br>
during the filling mode of operation. In this particular embodiment, the metering<br>
volume is 50uL, although, of course, the fluid dispenser 1 can be made to produce<br><br>
other metering volumes depending on the specific application and/or product to be<br>
dispensed.<br>
During the final phase of the upward return stroke of the container unit 58,<br>
in which the container unit 58 slides from the intermediate sliding position to the<br>
upper sliding position, the volume of the metering chamber 73 continues to reduce<br>
to increase the hydraulic pressure therein causing the outlet valve control member<br>
35 to lift off the outlet valve seat 36 and the metered volume of liquid 2 to be<br>
pumped from the metering chamber 73 out of the dispenser outlet orifice 27 via the<br>
nozzle bore 21. This is the dispensing mode of operation of the fluid dispenser 1<br>
and is shown schematically in FIGURE 3. At the end of the return stroke the outlet<br>
valve control member 35 re-closes the outlet valve opening 33.<br>
As will be appreciated, an actuation cycle of the fluid dispenser 1 results in<br>
the sealing piston 69 moving upwardly by an amount which results in the container<br>
inner volume 71 reducing by the metered volume. This ensures that no<br>
headspace is provided in the container inner volume 71 thereby ensuring no air is<br>
present therein. Accordingly, repeated use of the fluid dispenser 1 causes the<br>
sealing piston 69 to move incrementally upwardly until it bears against the roof 66<br>
of the container base 63 whereupon no further dispensing takes place.<br>
The use of the return spring 75 to drive the container unit 58 upwardly for<br>
the bleed and dispensing modes removes human force inconsistencies from the<br>
use of the fluid dispenser 1.<br>
The pumping force of the fluid dispenser 1 is such as to produce an<br>
atomised spray having a relative small and uniform droplet size ideal for delivery to<br>
the nasal passage of the user. For example, the fluid dispenser 1 may be adapted<br>
to dispense the metered volume as a spray of droplets having a diameter in the<br>
range of 10-20 µm.<br>
Mindful of the above description of the pumping action produced by<br>
reciprocation of the container unit 58 in the outer casing 3 along the longitudinal<br><br>
axis X-X, it will be seen that actuation of the actuation mechanism 100 of the fluid<br>
dispenser 1 has three sequential effects, namely:-<br>
(1)	Creating a filling mode in which an excess volume of the liquid 2 is drawn<br>
from the container 57 into the metering chamber' 73 by the negative<br>
pressure created in the metering chamber 73 as it expands.<br>
(2)	Creating a bleed mode in which the surplus volume of the liquid 2 in the<br>
metering chamber 73 is bled back to the container 57 to leave a metered<br>
volume in the metering chamber 73 as the metering chamber 73 begins to<br>
be compressed.<br>
(3)	A dispensing mode in which the metered volume is pumped from the<br>
dispenser 1 as the metering chamber 73 completes its compression to zero,<br>
or substantially zero, volume.<br>
Each further actuation of the actuating mechanism 100 results in this cycle<br>
of events being repeated until the sealing piston 69 abuts the roof 66 of the<br>
container base 63. In this particular embodiment, the inner volume 71 of the<br>
container base 63, which corresponds to the volume of liquid 2 that is dispensable<br>
from the fluid dispenser 1, is 14ml. Consequently, the fluid dispenser 1 has 280<br>
actuations.<br>
By way of example, the container 57 can be filled with the liquid 2 after it<br>
has been assembled into the fluid dispenser 1 by forming the sealing piston 69 so<br>
that it is able to be sealingly pierced by a needle-like object and then sealably<br>
reclose after withdrawal of the needle-like object (e.g. a "septum"). In this way, the<br>
liquid could be injected through the sealing piston 69. To this end, it will noted<br>
from FIGURE 1 that the outer casing halves 5a, 5b each have a base with a<br>
concave cut-out 81a, 81b which, when the outer casing 3 is assembled, provide an<br>
aperture in the outer casing base. The injector could be inserted through the<br>
sealing piston 69 via this aperture.<br><br>
An alternative filling method is vacuum filling, as will be understood by the<br>
skilled person in the art.<br>
A description of the actuation mechanism 100 will now be given with<br>
reference to FIGURES 2 and 3. The actuation mechanism is lever-based in the<br>
sense that actuation is effected through an actuation lever 101 which is mounted<br>
to the outer casing 3 in a longitudinal slot 102 thereof formed by the junction of<br>
opposed sides of the outer casing halves 5a, 5b.<br>
The actuation lever 101 has a lower end 103 which is pivotally connected to<br>
the outer casing 3 at a pivot point 105 for pivotal movement about a first lateral<br>
pivot axis P1-P1. The actuation lever 101 has an inner surface 107 from which<br>
depends a return leaf spring 108. The return leaf spring 108, which is preferably<br>
an integrally formed part of the lever 101, co-operates with the container base 63<br>
to bias the actuation lever 101 to an outward rest position in which it forms a flush<br>
fit in the outer casing 3, as shown in FIGURE 2A, for example. This is the position<br>
the actuation lever 101 adopts in the non-actuated or rest state of the fluid<br>
dispenser 1.<br>
As illustrated in FIGURES 2A to 2C, to actuate the actuating mechanism<br>
100	the user picks up the fluid dispenser 1 in their hand H and pushes the<br>
actuation lever 101 from its outward rest position into the outer casing 3 to cause it<br>
to pivot about the first pivot axis P1-P1 against the return force of the leaf spring<br>
108. The user uses a digit of the hand H holding the fluid dispenser 1 to push the<br>
actuation lever 101 inwardly, in this instance their thumb T. The actuation lever<br>
101	is returned to the outward return position upon release, or relaxation, of the<br>
pushing force F on the actuation lever 101 by the return spring 108.<br>
In this particular embodiment, the user pushes the actuation lever 101<br>
inwardly after the nozzle 19 has been inserted into one of their nostrils.<br>
Mounted to the inner surface 107 of the actuation lever 101 at an upper end<br>
104 thereof is a laterally extending drive structure 109 which is so constructed and<br><br>
arranged in the fluid dispenser 1 to transmit the inward pivotal motion of the<br>
actuation lever 101 into a downward driving force on the container unit 58 to effect<br>
the downward stroke thereof, as described hereinabove.<br>
More particularly, the drive structure 109 has a generally U-shaped outer<br>
carrier frame 111 pivotally connected to the actuation lever 101 for pivotal<br>
movement about a second lateral pivot axis P2-P2 which extends generally<br>
parallel to the first pivot axis P1-P1. The U-shaped outer carrier frame 111 has a<br>
pair of generally parallel side members 113a, 113b which straddle the neck 67 of<br>
the container 57 on opposed sides thereof and are connected at first ends thereof<br>
to pivot points 115a, 115b on the actuation lever inner surface 107, and a crossbar<br>
member 117 which connects the side members 113a, 113b at second ends<br>
thereof. Thus, the U-shaped outer carrier frame 111 forms a hollow box-like<br>
structure with the actuation lever 101 which encloses the neck 67 of the container<br>
57.<br>
The U-shaped outer carrier frame 111 further has a return leaf spring 119a,<br>
119b depending from the first end of each side member 113a, 113b which co-<br>
operates with the inner surface 107 of the actuation lever 101 to bias the U-shaped<br>
carrier frame 111 to an upper pivot position which, for example, is shown in<br>
FIGURE 2A.<br>
The drive structure 109 further comprises a generally U-shaped inner cam<br>
frame 121 which is carried by the U-shaped outer carrier frame 111 on the inside<br>
thereof. The inner cam frame 121 has a pair of generally parallel side members<br>
123a, 123b which are arranged generally parallel to the side members 113a, 113b<br>
of the outer carrier frame 111. The inner cam frame side members 123a, 123b are<br>
each provided with an outwardly projecting lug 125a, 125b at a first end thereof<br>
which is received in a longitudinal slide aperture 127a, 127b formed in the adjacent<br>
outer carrier frame side member 113a, 113b between the first and second ends<br>
thereof.<br><br>
The inner cam frame side members 123a, 123b are also each provided with<br>
an inwardly projecting cam element 129a, 129b of wing-like cross-section, the<br>
function of which will be outlined further hereinafter.<br>
The inner cam frame 121 further has a crossbar member 131 which<br>
connects the side members 123a, 123b at second ends thereof. The inner cam<br>
frame crossbar member 131 is configured as a C-shape clip which clips to the<br>
crossbar member 117 of the outer carrier frame 111 to enable the inner cam frame<br>
121 to be pivotal thereabout.<br>
The pivotal movement of the inner cam frame 121 on the outer carrier frame<br>
111 is governed by sliding movement of the lugs 125a, 125b in the associated<br>
slide apertures 127a, 127b. Specifically, the end limits of the pivotal movement of<br>
the inner cam frame 121 about the crossbar member 117 of the outer carrier frame<br>
111 between lower and upper pivot positions are respectively determined by the<br>
abutment of the lugs 125a, 125b with the lower and upper ends of the longitudinal<br>
slide apertures 127a, 127b.<br>
In this regard, and referring to FIGURE 1, the inner cam frame 121 yet<br>
further comprises a return leaf spring 133a, 133b projecting upwardly from each<br>
opposing end of the crossbar member 131. The return leaf springs 133a, 133b of<br>
the inner cam frame 121 each co-operate with an abutment surface 134 on the<br>
adjacent outer carrier frame side member 113a, 113b to bias the inner cam frame<br>
121 in the downward direction D to its lower pivot position. Thus, in the rest state<br>
of the fluid dispenser 1 shown in FIGURE 2A, for example, the lugs 125a, 125b of<br>
the inner cam frame 121 are held against the lower ends of the slide apertures<br>
127a, 127b of the outer carrier frame 111.<br>
The function of the inner cam frame 121 is to convert the inward movement<br>
of the actuation lever 101 into a downward camming action on the container unit<br>
58 and thereby place the fluid dispenser 1 in its filling mode. To this end, a pair of<br>
diametrically opposed peg-shaped cam followers 135a, 135b (only one shown)<br>
extend laterally from the neck 67 of the container 57. The cam followers 135a,<br><br>
135b and cam elements 129a, 129b on the inner cam frame 121 co-operate to<br>
produce the downward stroke of the container unit 58 representing the filling<br>
mode, as will now be described in more detail.<br>
When the fluid dispenser 1 is in its rest state, the component parts thereof<br>
adopt the relative positions shown in FIGURE 2A. Notably, the container unit 58 is<br>
held in its upper slide position by the return spring 75, the actuation lever 101 is in<br>
its outward pivot position, the outer carrier frame 111 is in its upper pivot position<br>
and the inner cam frame 121 is in its lower pivot position.<br>
Referring to FIGURES 2A and 2B, to actuate the actuation mechanism 100<br>
the actuation lever 101 is pivoted inwardly, as discussed previously, and this<br>
pivotal inward movement is transmitted to the drive structure 109 causing it to be<br>
displaced laterally inwardly. In an initial phase of the inward movement of the<br>
drive structure 109, the inner carrier frame 121 is moved from its lower pivot<br>
position relative to the outer carrier frame 111 to its upper pivot position as a result<br>
of the cam elements 129a, 129b riding up the upper surfaces of the cam followers<br>
135a, 135b. In other words, the lugs 125a, 125b are caused to slide upwardly in<br>
the slide apertures 127a, 127b from the lower end of the slide apertures 127a,<br>
127b to the upper ends with concomitant compression of the inner cam frame leaf<br>
springs 133a, 133b.<br>
Once the lugs 125a, 125b reach the upper ends of the slide apertures 127a,<br>
127b, the inner carrier frame 121 is "locked" in its upper pivot position.<br>
Referring to FIGURES 2C and 2D, continued inward movement of the<br>
actuation lever 101 leads to an intermediate phase of inward movement of the<br>
drive structure 109 in which the cam elements 129a, 129b act on the cam<br>
followers 135a, 135b to displace the container unit 58 in the downward direction D<br>
to its lower slide position against the return force of the return spring 75. This<br>
moves the fluid dispenser 1 into its filling mode in which the metering chamber 73<br>
is expanded and placed in flow communication with the liquid 2 in the container 57.<br><br>
Referring to FIGURES 2E and 2F, further continued inward movement of<br>
the actuation lever 101 leads to a terminal phase of inward movement of the drive<br>
structure 109 in which the cam elements 129a, 129b disengage from the cam<br>
followers 135a, 135b whereby the return spring 75 operates to return the container<br>
unit 58 to its upper slide position. This moves the fluid dispenser 1 sequentially<br>
through its bleed and dispensing modes of operation described hereinabove so<br>
that a metered volume of the liquid 2 is discharged from the nasal nozzle 19 as an<br>
atomised spray S (FIGURES 2F and 3) into the user's nasal cavity. FIGURE 3<br>
shows in detail how the outlet valve control member 35 is lifted off the outlet valve<br>
seat 36 during the dispensing mode by the hydraulic pressure built up in the<br>
metering chamber 73 once the metering chamber 73 is sealed after the bleed<br>
mode. As indicated by the arrows, this allows the liquid 2 to be pumped through<br>
the outlet valve aperture 33, around the side of the outlet valve control member 35,<br>
through the aperture(s) 40 in the outlet valve control member 35 and out of the<br>
outlet orifice 27 via the nozzle bore 21.<br>
Furthermore, once the cam elements 129a, 129b disengage from the cam<br>
followers 135a, 135b the return leaf springs 133a, 133b of the inner cam frame<br>
121 are free to slide the lugs 125a, 125b downwardly in the slide apertures 127a,<br>
127b to return the inner cam frame 121 to its lower slide position on the outer<br>
carrier frame 111. This is shown most clearly in FIGURE 2F.<br>
As shown in FIGURE 2E, for instance, the inward movement of the drive<br>
structure 109 is delimited by abutment of the crossbar 131 of the inner cam frame<br>
121 with an inner surface of the outer casing 3.<br>
Once the fluid dispenser 1 has dispensed the metered volume of liquid, the user<br>
can remove or reduce the inward displacement force F on the actuation lever 101<br>
to allow the actuation lever return leaf spring 108 to return the actuation lever 101<br>
to its outward rest position to reset the fluid dispenser 1 in its rest mode in<br>
preparation for its next use. This sequence is shown in FIGURES 2G to 21 from<br>
which it will be noted that, in an initial phase of the concomitant returning outward<br>
movement of the drive structure 109, the cam elements 129a, 129b re-engage the<br><br>
As shown in FIGURES 5A to 5G, a relief inlet valve 150 is positioned<br>
between the metering chamber 73 and the inner volume 71 of the container 57<br>
which remains closed other than when the downstroke of the container unit 58 is<br>
initiated whereupon it is temporarily caused to open by the reduced pressure<br>
created in the metering chamber 73 during this phase. This allows liquid 2 to enter<br>
the metering chamber 73 before the transfer ports 55a-c (three shown this time)<br>
are placed in flow communication with the metering chamber 73. This makes it<br>
easier to move the container unit 58 in the downward direction D against the<br>
reduced pressure in the metering chamber 73 until the transfer ports 55a-c are<br>
opened, whereupon liquid 2 enters the metering chamber 73 therethrough. This<br>
results in the pressure in the metering chamber 73 increasing which biases the<br>
inlet valve 150 back to its shut position. Filling of the metering chamber 73 then<br>
continues through the transfer ports 55a-c as previously described with reference<br>
to FIGURES 1 to 3.<br>
More particularly, the inlet valve 150 has an inlet valve opening 151 in the<br>
lateral lower end wall 49 of the U-shaped sliding member 43 and an inlet valve<br>
control element 153 slidably, sealingly mounted in the inlet valve opening 151 for<br>
movement between a closed position, shown in FIGURE 5A, in which the inlet<br>
valve control element 153 is seated on an inlet valve seat 152 to shut the inlet<br>
valve opening 151 to prevent flow communication between the metering chamber<br>
73 and the inner volume 71 of the container 57, and an open position, shown in<br>
FIGURE 5B, in which the inlet valve control element 153 moves off the inlet valve<br>
seat 152 to open the inlet valve opening 151 to put the metering chamber 73 and<br>
the inner volume 71 of the container 57 in flow communication. The inlet valve<br>
150 further has a return spring 155 which biases the inlet valve control element<br>
153 to its closed position.<br>
FIGURE 5A shows that the inlet valve control element 153 is biased by the<br>
return spring 155 to the closed position in the rest state of the fluid dispenser 1.<br>
When the actuation mechanism 100 is actuated by inward displacement of the<br>
actuation lever 101, the U-shaped sliding member 43 is moved downwardly with<br><br>
cam followers 135a, 135b, albeit this time riding over the lower cam follower<br>
surfaces due to the lugs 125a, 125b now being at the lower ends of the slide<br>
apertures 127a, 127b. Moreover, for the same reason, the outer carrier frame 111<br>
tilts to its lower pivot position on the actuation lever 101.<br>
Towards the end of the return movement of the actuation mechanism 100 to<br>
its rest state, the cam elements 129a, 129b disengage from the cam followers<br>
135a, 135b thereby enabling the outer carrier frame 111 and inner cam frame 121<br>
to return to their respective rest states.<br>
In this embodiment, the actuation lever 101, the outer carrier frame 111 and<br>
the inner cam frame 121 are made from a plastics material, for instance ABS, as<br>
an example by moulding.<br>
In a modification of the fluid dispenser 1, the container 57 may be replaced<br>
by a bag structure which would1 contract and expand in equivalent fashion, and for<br>
equivalent function, as the container 57, e.g. by being made from a flexible<br>
material, for instance a plastics material. An advantage of a bag structure over the<br>
container 57 would be that it avoids the need for a complex structure for<br>
contraction and expansion of its inner volume.<br>
An example of a bag container 157 is shown in FIGURE 4 with like<br>
reference numerals indicating like features in the container 57 of FIGURES 1 to 3.<br>
The bag container 157 has a head 159 and a neck 167 corresponding to those in<br>
the container 57. The base 163 of the bag container 157 is formed by a bag<br>
element which expands/contracts depending on the mode of operation of the fluid<br>
dispenser 1.<br>
Referring now to FIGURES 5A to 5G, there is shown an alternative valve<br>
arrangement for use in the fluid dispenser 1 of FIGURES 1 to 3. For simplicity,<br>
those features in the alternative valve arrangement which are equivalent to<br>
features of the valve arrangement shown in FIGURES 1 to 3 are ascribed like<br>
reference numerals.<br><br>
respect to the outlet valve body 28 causing the metering chamber 73 to expand<br>
from its contracted state. The reduced or negative pressure this creates in the<br>
metering chamber 73 draws the inlet valve control element 153 up off the inlet<br>
valve seat 152 to its open position against the return force of the inlet valve return<br>
spring 155. The reduced pressure in the metering chamber 73 then draws liquid 2<br>
into the metering chamber 73 from the container 57 through the inlet valve opening<br>
151, as shown in FIGURE 5B. At this point the transfer ports 55a-c are still shut in<br>
the sense that they have not travelled below the lower sealing ring 41.<br>
As the downward movement of the U-shaped sliding member 43 continues<br>
during the filling mode of operation of the fluid dispenser 1, the metering chamber<br>
73 continues to expand and draw in liquid 2 through the inlet valve 150 until the<br>
transfer ports 55a-c open so liquid 2 can be drawn into the metering chamber 73<br>
through these, as shown in FIGURE 5C. As further shown by FIGURE 5C, as the<br>
pressure in the metering chamber 73 increases on intake of liquid 2 thereinto, the<br>
return force of the inlet valve return spring 155 biases the inlet valve control<br>
element 153 back onto the inlet valve seat 152 to close the inlet valve aperture<br>
151.<br>
The metering chamber 73 is then filled up through the transfer ports 55a-c<br>
as the U-shaped sliding member 43 completes its downward stroke. As shown in<br>
FIGURES 5A to 5D, the outlet valve 130 remains shut during the whole of the<br>
downward stroke. Specifically, the outlet valve control element 135 is biased by<br>
the outlet valve return spring 138 into sealing engagement in the outlet valve<br>
aperture 133 (the closed position).<br>
FIGURES 5E to 5G depict the upward stroke of the container 57 from which<br>
it will be seen that the inlet valve 150 stays shut. FIGURES 5F and 5G show that<br>
after the transfer ports 55a-c are re-closed by the lower sealing ring 41, the<br>
hydraulic pressure in the metering chamber 73 is sufficient to open the outlet valve<br>
130 to enable discharge of the metered volume contained in the metering chamber<br>
73. Specifically, as shown in FIGURE 5F, the hydraulic pressure created in the<br>
metering chamber 73 forces the outlet valve control element 135 to slide upwardly<br><br>
in the outlet valve aperture 133 against the biasing force of the outlet valve return<br>
spring 138 to enable the liquid in the metering chamber 73 to pass through the<br>
outlet valve 130 to the outlet orifice 27 (the open position). As shown in FIGURE<br>
5G, once the metered volume has been dispensed, the outlet valve return spring<br>
138 returns the outlet valve control element 135 to its closed position.<br>
The outlet and inlet valve control members 135, 153 may be made from a<br>
plastics material, such as polypropylene (PP), for example by moulding.<br>
The fluid dispenser 1 described above provides for high accuracy dosing<br>
from a sealed system which protects the liquid 2 from contamination from the<br>
externa! environment. For instance, the non-return outlet valve 30; 130 prevents<br>
air ingress. Moreover, the container inner volume 71 is isolated from the outlet<br>
orifice 27 by the outlet valve 30; 130 and the closure of the outlet valve aperture 33<br>
by the U-shaped sliding member 43 in the rest state of the dispenser. Accordingly,<br>
the liquid can be preservative-free, of particular benefit when the liquid is a<br>
medicament.<br>
The dispenser 1 further dispenses without the need for a dip tube, and there<br>
is no drain back.<br>
Other advantages of the fluid dispenser 1 that may be mentioned are,<br>
without limitation:-<br>
•	Its compactness due to its in-line arrangement, as compared, for example, with<br>
the dispenser disclosed in International patent application Nos.<br>
PCT/EP03/08646 and PCT/EP03/08647.<br>
•	The need for the user to only move the actuating lever 101 in a single direction<br>
to produce a complete actuation cycle.<br>
Where the dispenser of the invention is a medicament dispenser, for<br>
instance an intra-nasal medicament dispenser, administration of the medicament<br><br>
may be indicated for the treatment of mild, moderate or severe acute or chronic<br>
symptoms or for prophylactic treatment.<br>
Appropriate medicaments may thus be selected from, for example,<br>
analgesics, e.g., codeine, dihydromorphine, ergotamine, fentanyl or morphine;<br>
anginal preparations, e.g., diltiazem; antiallergics, e.g., cromoglycate (e.g. as the<br>
sodium salt), ketotifen or nedocromil (e.g. as the sodium salt); antiinfectives e.g.,<br>
cephalosporins, penicillins, streptomycin, sulphonamides, tetracyclines and<br>
pentamidine; antihistamines, e.g., methapyrilene; anti- inflammatories, e.g.,<br>
beclomethasone (e.g. as the dipropionate ester), fluticasone (e.g. as the<br>
propionate ester), flunisolide, budesonide, rofleponide, mometasone (e.g. as the<br>
furcate ester), ciclesonide, triamcinolone (e.g. as the acetonide), 6a, 9a-difluoro-<br>

furanylcarbonyl)oxy]-11 p-hydroxy-16a-methyl-3-oxo-androsta-1,4-diene-17p-<br>
carbothioic acid S-fluoromethyl ester; antitussives, e.g., noscapine;<br>
bronchodilators, e.g., albuterol (e.g. as free base or sulphate), salmeterol (e.g. as<br>
xinafoate), ephedrine, adrenaline, fenoterol (e.g. as hydrobromide), formoterol<br>
(e.g. as fumarate), isoprenaline, metaproterenol, phenylephrine,<br>
phenylpropanolamine, pirbuterol (e.g. as acetate), reproterol (e.g. as<br>
hydrochloride), rimiterol, terbutaline (e.g. as sulphate), isoetharine, tulobuterol or<br>
4-hydroxy-7-[2-[[2-[[3-(2-phenylethoxy)propyl]sulfonyl]ethyl]amino]ethyl-2(3H)-<br>
benzothiazolone; PDE4 inhibitors e.g. cilomilast or roflumilast; leukotriene<br>
antagonists e.g. montelukast, pranlukast and zafirlukast; [adenosine 2a agonists,<br>
e.g. 2R,3R,4S,5R)-2-[6-Amino-2-(1S-hydroxymethyl-2-phenyl-ethylamino)-purin-<br>
9-yl]-5-(2-ethyl-2H-tetrazol-5-yl)-tetrahydro-furan-3,4-diol (e.g. as maleate)]; [a4<br>
integrin	inhibitors	e.g.	(2S)-3-[4-({[4-(aminocarbonyl)-1-<br>
piperidinyl]carbonyl}oxy)phenyl]-2-[((2S)-4-methyl-2-{[2-(2-methylphenoxy)<br>
acetyl]amino}pentanoyl)amino] propanoic acid (e.g. as free acid or potassium<br>
salt)], diuretics, e.g., amiloride; anticholinergics, e.g., ipratropium (e.g. as bromide),<br>
tiotropium, atropine or oxitropium; hormones, e.g., cortisone, hydrocortisone or<br>
prednisolone; xanthines, e.g., aminophylline, choline theophyllinate, lysine<br><br>
theophyllinate or theophylline; therapeutic proteins and peptides, e.g., insulin or<br>
glucagons. It will be clear to a person skilled in the art that, where appropriate, the<br>
medicaments may be used in the form of salts, (e.g., as alkali metal or amine salts<br>
or as acid addition salts) or as esters (e.g., lower alkyl esters) or as solvates (e.g.,<br>
hydrates) to optimise the activity and/or stability of the medicament and/or to<br>
minimise the solubility of the medicament in the propellant.<br>
Preferably, the medicament is an anti-inflammatory compound for the<br>
treatment of inflammatory disorders or diseases such as asthma and rhinitis.<br>
The medicament may be a glucocorticoid compound, which has anti-<br>
inflammatory properties. One suitable glucocorticoid compound has the chemical<br>
name: 6a, 9a-Difluoro-17a-(1-oxopropoxy)-11p-hydroxy-16a-methyl-3-oxo-<br>
androsta-1,4-diene-17p-carbothioic acid S-fluoromethyl ester (fluticasone<br>
propionate). Another suitable glucocorticoid compound has the chemical name:<br>
6a,	9a-difluoro-17a-[(2-furanyfcarbonyl)oxy]-11 p-hydroxy-16a-methyl-3-oxo-<br>
androsta-1,4-diene-17p-carbothioic acid S-fluoromethyl ester. A further suitable<br>
glucocorticoid compound has the chemical name: 6a,9a-Difluoro-11 p-hydroxy-<br>
16a-methyl-17a-[(4-methyl-1,3-thiazole-5-carbonyl)oxy]-3-oxo-androsta-1,4-diene-<br>
17p-carbothioic acid S-fluoromethyl ester.<br>
Other suitable anti-inflammatory compounds include NSAIDs e.g. PDE4<br>
inhibitors, leukotriene antagonists, iNOS inhibitors, tryptase and elastase<br>
inhibitors, beta-2 integrin antagonists and adenosine 2a agonists.<br>
The medicament is formulated as any suitable fluid formulation, particularly<br>
a solution (e.g. aqueous) formulation or a suspension formulation, optionally<br>
containing other pharmaceutically acceptable additive components. The<br>
formulation may contain a preservative, although the sealed system of the<br>
dispenser may negate the need for this.<br>
The medicament formulation may incorporate two or more medicaments.<br><br>
The dispenser herein is suitable for dispensing fluid medicament<br>
formulations for the treatment of inflammatory and/or allergic conditions of the<br>
nasal passages such as rhinitis e.g. seasonal and perennial rhinitis as well as<br>
other local inflammatory conditions such as asthma, COPD and dermatitis.<br>
A suitable dosing regime would be for the patient to inhale slowly through<br>
the nose subsequent to the nasal cavity being cleared. During inhalation the<br>
formulation would be applied to one nostril while the other is manually<br>
compressed. This procedure would then be repeated for the other nostril.<br>
Typically, one or two inhalations per nostril would be administered by the above<br>
procedure up to three times each day, ideally once daily. Each dose, for example,<br>
may deliver 5 µg, 50 µg, 100 µg, 200(µg or 250µg of active medicament. The precise<br>
dosage is either known or readily ascertainable by those skilled in the art.<br>
It will be understood by the skilled reader in the art that the present<br>
invention is not limited to the embodiments herein described with reference to the<br>
FIGURES of drawings, but may be varied to adopt other guises within the scope<br>
of the appended claims. As an example, the dispenser of the invention need not<br>
be hand-held, nor hand-operable. Furthermore, the dispenser may be used to<br>
deliver any number of different fluid products, medicinal and non-medicinal, as<br>
outlined previously. Additionally, the dispenser may form an internal part of a<br>
device unit so that the dispenser delivers a metered volume of the fluid product to<br>
another internal part of the device unit. For instance, the unit may be a dispenser<br>
unit including the dispenser and the metered volume is delivered to conveying<br>
means in the dispenser unit which conveys the fluid product to an outlet orifice of<br>
the unit for discharge from the unit to the surrounding environment. The conveying<br>
means may be such as to change the state of the fluid, e.g. the conveying means<br>
may have a vibrating element, e.g. a mesh, which converts a metered volume of<br>
liquid to an aerosol or mist which is then directed out of the outlet orifice. The<br>
vibrating element could, for example, be a piezoelectric element or mesh.<br><br>
Finally, for the avoidance of doubt, the inclusion of reference numerals in<br>
the claims is purely for illustration, and not meant to have a limiting effect on the<br>
scope of the claims.<br><br>
