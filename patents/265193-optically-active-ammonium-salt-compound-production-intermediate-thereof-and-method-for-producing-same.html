OPTICALLY ACTIVE AMMONIUM SALT COMPOUND, PRODUCTION<br>
INTERMEDIATE THEREOF AND METHOD FOR PRODUCING SAME<br>
[Technical Field]<br>
[0001]<br>
The present invention relates to a compound of an optically active quaternary<br>
ammonium salt which is useful as a chiral phase transfer catalyst and more specifically,<br>
relates to a novel optically active quaternary ammonium salt, and an intermediate and<br>
production method for producing said compound.<br>
Priority is claimed on Japanese Patent Applications No. 2005-059694, filed<br>
March 3, 2005, and No. 2005-192757, filed June 30, 2005, the contents of which are<br>
incorporated herein by reference.<br>
[Background Art]<br>
[0002]<br>
Many compounds regarding optically active spiro quaternary ammonium salts<br>
have been known to date. Examples thereof include the compound described in Patent<br>
document 1 and represented by the following formula<br>
[0003]<br><br>
[0004]<br>
and the compound described in Patent document 3, and the documents disclose<br><br>
2<br>
that these compounds perform extremely effectively as a phase transfer catalyst for<br>
synthesizing optically active a-amino acids regardless of being natural or not. However,<br>
the optically active spiro quaternary ammonium salts described in these documents are<br>
expensive since they are constituted from two kinds of binaphthyl derivatives having<br>
different substituents, and thus they are not necessarily satisfactory for industrial use.<br>
[0005]<br>
Moreover, the compound represented by the following formula is described in<br>
Patent document 2.<br>
[0006] <br>
However, because the compound is optically active only on one side, the reaction time is<br>
long, and thus the compound is not necessarily satisfactory for industrial use.<br>
[0007]<br>
Furthermore, the compound represented by the following formula is described in<br>
Patent document 4. However, since the spiro quaternary ammonium salts described in<br>
these documents are constituted of two kinds of optically active biphenyl derivatives<br>
which have the same substituents, there are limits in catalyst design, and thus the salts are<br>
not necessarily satisfactory for industrial use.<br>
[0008]<br><br>
3<br><br>
[0009]<br>
For this reason, the development of an optically active spiro quaternary<br>
ammonium salt which is effective as a phase transfer catalyst for synthesizing optically<br>
active a-amino acids and which is readily produced and is also practical, has been<br>
desired.<br>

[Disclosure of the Invention]<br>
[Problems to be Solved by the Invention]<br>
[0011]<br>
The present invention is made to solve the aforementioned problems of the prior<br>
art regarding the compounds of optically active quaternary ammonium salts which are<br>
useful as chiral phase transfer catalysts. The object of the present invention is to<br>
provide a compound having excellent effects in synthesizing optically active amino acids<br>
regardless of being natural or not, and a production method capable of producing said<br>
compound to industrial advantage.<br><br>
4<br>
[Means for Solving the Problem]<br>
[0012]<br>
The present inventors studied intensively in order to solve the above problems<br>
and discovered the following to complete the present invention. That is, optically active<br>
spiro quaternary ammonium salts, which are constituted from two kinds of biphenyl<br>
derivatives having different substituents or from a biphenyl derivative and binaphthyl<br>
derivative, and which can be used as a catalyst having excellent effects in synthesizing<br>
optically active amino acids and which are industrially useful, as well as a method for<br>
readily producing said quaternary ammonium salts.<br>
[0013]<br>
In the present invention, the discovered method for readily producing the spiro<br>
quaternary ammonium salts is based on kinetic resolution. According to said<br>
production method, for example, even when a biphenyl derivative, which is a material<br>
compound, has no optical activity, a compound of an optically active quaternary<br>
ammonium salt having two axial asymmetries can readily be obtained by reacting with<br>
an optically active azepine derivative. During this process, it is also possible to recover<br>
the biphenyl derivative which is not involved in the reaction as an optically active<br>
substance. In addition, when a biphenyl derivative, which is a material compound, has<br>
an optical activity, likewise, a compound of an optically active quaternary ammonium<br>
salt having two axial asymmetries can readily be obtained by reacting with an azepine<br>
derivative which has no optical activity, and it is also possible to recover the azepine<br>
derivative, which is not involved in the reaction, as an optically active substance.<br>
[0014]<br>
Furthermore, another basis constituting the method for readily producing the<br>
spiro quaternary ammonium salts which have been discovered in the present invention is<br><br>
5<br>
the simple production method of azepines which are important production intermediates<br>
for producing the spiro quaternary ammonium salts. According to the present<br>
production method, by reacting a 2,2'-bis(substituted methyl)biaryl compound, which<br>
has a substituent at the 3,3'-positions, with ammonia, corresponding azepines can readily<br>
be obtained.<br>
[0015]<br>

quaternary ammonium salt compound represented by the formula (1)<br>

Since the optically active quaternary ammonium salt compound represented by<br>
the aforementioned formula (1) and the following formula (1') (one of the axially<br>
asymmetric compounds, which are enantiomorphic, is in excess compared to the other)<br>
are constituted by an optically active and axially asymmetric biphenyl and optically<br>
active and axially asymmetric binaphthyl, or by 2 kinds of optically active and axially<br>
asymmetric biphenyl groups, 4 kinds of isomers of said compound exist; i.e., S,S-form,<br>
R,R-form, S,R-form, and R,S-form following the conventional symbols showing an<br>
axially asymmetric optical activity, and all these isomers are included in the present<br>
invention.<br>
[0076]<br>
The quaternary ammonium salt compound (1') of the present invention can be<br>
produced, for example, by any one the following methods.<br>
(i) Reacting a racemic bisbenzyl compound (2a') and optically active azepine derivative<br>
(5b)<br>
[0077]<br><br>
25<br><br>
[0078]<br>
(ii) Reacting an optically active bisbenzyl compound (2b') and racemic azepine<br>
derivative (5 a)<br>

[0079]<br><br>
[0080]<br>
(iv) Reacting an optically active azepine derivative (3 b) and racemic biphenyl derivative<br>

substance<br>
[0081]<br><br>
26<br>
In all the production methods (i) to (iv) of the present invention, when optically<br>
active materials are reacted with each other, two asymmetric axes of the obtained<br>
quaternary ammonium salt compound are both optically active. However, even when<br>
one material, which is optically active, is reacted with another material, which is racemic,<br>
the former preferentially reacts with one enantiomer of the latter due to kinetic resolution<br>
and two asymmetric axes of the obtained quaternary ammonium salt compound are<br>
produced so that they are both optically active. For this reason, the enantiomer of the<br>
latter material which is not involved in the production is recovered as an optically active<br>
substance. Accordingly, in the production method of the present invention, even when<br>
one material is not optically active, the quaternary ammonium salt compound having two<br>
asymmetric axes which are both optically active can readily be obtained, and thus it is an<br>
advantageous method industrially.<br>
[0082]<br>
1 to 10 times of the racemic substance in the present invention can be used<br>
relative to the optically active substance in terms of moles, and particularly, the use of 1.5<br>
to 3 times in terms of moles is preferable industrially.<br>
[0083]<br>
The present reaction can be carried out under the presence of a solvent or<br>
without a solvent. Usable solvents are not particularly limited as long as they are<br>
solvents inert to the reaction and examples thereof include hydrocarbon solvents such as<br>
pentane, hexane, heptane, benzene, toluene, and xylene; halogen solvents such as<br>
dichloromethane, 1,2-dichloroethane, chloroform, and carbon tetrachloride; alcohols<br>
such as methanol and ethanol; nitrile solvents such as acetonitrile and propionenitrile;<br>
ether solvents such as diethylether, dioxane, and tetrahydrofuran; non-protonic polar<br>
solvents such as N,N-dimethylformamide and dimethylsulfoxide; water; and mixed<br><br>
27<br>
solvent systems in which two or more of these solvents are mixed.<br>
[0084]<br>
Examples of the bases include inorganic bases such as sodium hydroxide,<br>
potassium hydroxide, sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate, sodium bicarbonate, and<br>
potassium bicarbonate; and organic bases such as pyridine, triethylamine,<br>
N,N-dimethylaniline, 4-dimethylaminopyridine, N-methylpyrrolidine,<br>
N-methylmorpholine, and l,8-diazabicyclo(5.4.0)undeca-7-ene. The amount of base<br>
used is normally 1 to 10 times and preferably 1 to 3 times of that of an optically active<br>
binaphthyl derivative or optically active biphenyl derivative in terms of moles.<br>
[0085]<br>
The temperature range of the present reaction is -78°C to 200°C and preferably<br>
-20°C to 100°C. The range of reaction time is 30 minutes to 100 hours, although this<br>
depends on the amount of reaction agents, temperature, or the like.<br>
[0086]<br>

[0087]<br>
On the other hand, azepine derivatives (3a), (3b), (5a), and (5b), which are<br>
production intermediates, can be produced by following the description below.<br>
[0088]<br>
That is, 3,3'-dihalogeno-2,2'-dianilines (13), which are obtained by<br>
halogenating the bisanilines (12) produced from a known substance based on Japanese<br>
Laid-Open Patent Application No. 2004-359578, is reacted under the condition of Suzuki<br><br>
28<br>
coupling described in Japanese Laid-Open Patent Application No. 2001-48866 or the like<br>
(refer to J. Organomet. Chem., 1999, 576, 147) to obtain 3,3-disubstituted-2,2'-dianilines<br>
(14).<br>
[0089]<br><br>
(In the formula, X1 represents halogen and R1, R2, R21, and R3 are the same as above.)<br>
[0090]<br>
Examples of the halogenating reagents include N-bromosuccinimide (NBS),<br>

the boiling point of the solvent.<br>
[0091]<br>
Subsequently, a 3,3'-disubstituted-2,2'-dihalogenated substance (15) is prepared<br>
by converting the amino group in 3,3-disubstituted-2,2'-dianilines (14) to halogen using<br>
a nitrite, and by treating this substance (15) with a carbon monoxide-Pd catalyst, a<br>
3,3'-disubstituted-2,2'-diester substance (16) is obtained.<br><br>
29<br>
[0092]<br>
The conversion of amino to halogen due to a nitrite can be carried out based on<br>
the method described in Japanese Laid-Open Patent Application No. 2004-359578, and<br>
the conversion of the 3,3'-disubstituted-2,2'-dihalogenated substance (15) to the<br>
3,3'-disubstituted-2,2'-diester substance (16) can be carried out based on the method<br>
described in Synlett (1998) 2,183.<br>
[0093]<br><br>
(In the formula, X represents halogen and R , R2, R , and R are the same as above.)<br>
[0094]<br>
Moreover, by carrying out halogenation/Suzuki coupling reaction due to the<br>
method according to the above using a known compound or a biphenyl-2,2'-diester<br>
substance (14'), which can be derived by known methods, 3,3'-disubstituted-2,2'-diester<br>
substance (16) can also be obtained via 3,3'-dihalogenobiphenyl-2,2'-diester substance<br>
(15').<br>

[0096]<br>

Jikken Kagaku Koza (Courses in Experimental Chemistry, 4th Ed., edited by The<br>
Chemical Society of Japan and published by Maruzen Co., Ltd., vol. 20, pp.10-141).<br>
[0097]<br><br>
(In the formula, R1, R2, R21, and R3 are the same as above.)<br>
[0098]<br>
Subsequently, the hydroxyl in 3,3'-disubstituted-2,2'-bishydroxymethyl<br>
substance (17) is converted to a leaving group such as halogen based on the method<br>
described in Jikken Kagaku Koza (Courses in Experimental Chemistry, 4th Ed., edited by<br>
The Chemical Society of Japan and published by Maruzen Co., Ltd., vol. 19, pp.43 8-445)<br>
to obtain a bisbenzyl compound (2a').<br>
[0099]<br><br>
31<br><br>
[0100]<br>
(In the formula, Y2 represents a leaving group and R1, R2, R21, and R3 are the<br>
same as above.)<br>
Examples of the abovementioned leaving group Y2 include halogen,<br>
p-toluenesulfonyloxy, and methanesulfonyloxy.<br>
[0101]<br>
On the other hand, 3,3'-disubstituted-2,2'-dihalogen substance (15) can be<br>
converted to 3,3'-disubstituted-2,2'-dimethyl substance (17') according to the method<br>
described in a document (J. Mol. Catal., 1990, 60, 343), and the bisbenzyl compound<br>
(2a') can also be obtained by subjecting the substance (17') to a general halogenation<br>
condition.<br>
[0102]<br><br>
32<br><br>
(In the formula, R1, R2, R21, R3, and Y2 are the same as above.)<br>
[0103]<br>
Furthermore, 6,6'-dialkoxy-3,3'-disubstituted-2,2'-dimethyl substance (17") is<br>
obtained, for example, by carrying out halogenation/Suzuki coupling reaction according<br>
to the aforementioned method using 6,6'-dialkoxy-2,2'-dimethylbiphenyl derivative<br>
(14"), which can be synthesized based on a document (J. Chem. Soc, 1950, 711) or the<br>
like. By the same treatment carried out on the substance (17') to prepare the substance<br>
(2a'), the substance (17") can be derived to a corresponding bisbenzyl compound (2a").<br>
[0104]<br><br>
[0105]<br>
(In the formula, Ralc represents alkoxy and R2, R3, R21, and Y2 are the same as<br>
above.)<br><br>
33<br>
[0106]<br>
In addition, it is possible to obtain biphenyl derivatives (4a) from diols (18)<br>
according to a document (J. Am. Chem. Soc, 121,6519 (1999)).<br>
[0107]<br><br>
[0108]<br>
(In the formula, R4, R5, R6, and Y2 are the same as above.)<br>
[0109]<br>
The synthesis method of the aforementioned bisbenzyl compound (2a') and<br>
biphenyl derivatives (4a) can be applied to the corresponding optically-active compounds<br>
(2b') and (4b).<br>
[0110]<br>
By reacting these biphenyls with ammonia, an azepine derivative (3a), (3b), (5a),<br>
or (5b) can be produced.<br>
[0111]<br><br>
34<br><br>
[0112]<br>
(In the formula, R1, R2, R21, R3, R4, R5, R6, X, and X3 are the same as above and<br>
the symbols (*) and (**) represents optical activity when the compound is labeled with<br>
the alphabet "b".)<br>
[0113]<br>
The present reaction can be carried out by reacting the respective solvent<br>
solutions of biphenyls and ammonia, or by reacting one with the other's solvent solution<br>
directly.<br><br>
35<br>
Although the solvent used is not particularly limited as long as it does not react<br>
with biphenyls and ammonia, examples thereof include hydrocarbon solvents such as<br>
pentane, hexane, heptane, benzene, toluene, and xylene; halogen solvents such as<br>
dichloromethane, 1,2-dichloroethane, chloroform, and carbon tetrachloride; alcohols<br>
such as methanol and ethanol; nitrile solvents such as acetonitrile and propionenitrile;<br>
ether solvents such as diethylether, dioxane, and tetrahydrofuran; non-protonic polar<br>
solvents such as N,N-dimethylformamide and dimethylsulfoxide; water; and mixed<br>
solvent systems in which two or more of these solvents are mixed. In addition, the<br>
solvent for dissolving ammonia is not particularly limited as long as it does not react with<br>
ammonia. Examples thereof include hydrocarbon solvents such as pentane, hexane,<br>
heptane, benzene, toluene, and xylene; halogen solvents such as dichloromethane,<br>
1,2-dichloroethane, chloroform, and carbon tetrachloride; alcohols such as methanol and<br>
ethanol; nitrile solvents such as acetonitrile and propionenitrile; ether solvents such as<br>
diethylether, dioxane, and tetrahydrofuran; non-protonic polar solvents such as<br>
N,N-dimethylformamide and dimethylsulfoxide; water; and mixed solvent systems in<br>
which two or more of these solvents are mixed.<br>
[0114]<br>
Although the method is not particularly limited, the reaction can be carried out,<br>
for example, by adding ammonia, in either gaseous form or liquid form, to the solution of<br>
biphenyls directly, or by adding the aforementioned solvent solution of ammonia<br>
dropwise to the solution of biphenyls.<br>
Although the mixing ratio of a solvent and biphenyls is not particularly limited,<br>
it can appropriately be set from 1: 1 to 100: 1 (volume: weight). Likewise, ammonia<br>
can also be used in an arbitrary concentration.<br>
The mole ratio of biphenyls and ammonia is from 1: 0.2 to 1: 10 and preferably<br><br>
36<br>
from l: 1 to 1:5.<br>
Reaction temperature is -70°C to the boiling point of solvents and preferably<br>
-20°C to 40°C.<br>
[0115]<br>
After completing the reaction and the distillation process to remove unreacted<br>
ammonia, azepine derivatives can be separated/purified by applying known conventional<br>
methods such as extraction, washing, distillation, column chromatography, drying, and<br>
recrystallization.<br>
[0116]<br>
The production of an optically active quaternary ammonium salt compound (1)<br>
can be carried out by following the condition of a general N-benzylation reaction as<br>
shown below.<br>
(a)	Reacting an optically active bisbenzyl compound (2b') with an optically active<br>
azepine derivative (5b); or<br>
(b)	Reacting an optically active biphenyl compound (4b) with an optically active azepine<br>
derivative (3b)<br>
[0117]<br>
Additionally, the production of an optically active quaternary ammonium salt<br>
compound (1) can also be carried out by the kinetic resolution method. In other words,<br>
it can be performed by reacting a racemic substance with an optically active substance as<br>
shown below.<br>
(i) Reacting a racemic bisbenzyl compound (2a') with an optically active azepine<br>
derivative (5b);<br>
(ii) Reacting an optically active bisbenzyl compound (2b') with a racemic azepine<br>
derivative (5a);<br><br>
37<br>
(iii) Reacting a racemic azepine derivative (3 a) with an optically active biphenyl<br>
derivative (4b); or<br>
(iv) Reacting an optically active azepine derivative (3b) with a racemic biphenyl<br>
derivative (4a)<br>
[0118]<br>
The reaction between 2 kinds of the aforementioned substances can readily be<br>
carried out in an appropriate solvent under the presence of a base.<br>
[0119]<br>
Solvents can be used regardless of their type as long as they are not involved in<br>
the reaction. Examples thereof include hydrocarbon solvents such as pentane, hexane,<br>
heptane, benzene, toluene, and xylene; halogen solvents such as dichloromethane,<br>
1,2-dichloroethane, chloroform, and carbon tetrachloride; alcohols such as methanol and<br>
ethanol; nitrile solvents such as acetonitrile and propionenitrile; ether solvents such as<br>
diethylether, dioxane, and tetrahydrofuran; non-protonic polar solvents such as<br>
N,N-dimethylformamide and dimethylsulfoxide; and mixed solvent systems in which<br>
two or more of these solvents are mixed. However, since the present reaction can be<br>
carried out under the phase-transfer reaction conditions, solvent systems, in which a<br>
water-insoluble solvent among the aforementioned solvents and water are combined, can<br>
also be used.<br>
[0120]<br>
Although general inorganic bases can be used as the base, which may be used,<br>
more preferable examples thereof include sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide,<br>
sodium carbonate, and potassium carbonate.<br>
[0121]<br>
Reaction can be performed in a solvent or in a solvent system while stirring<br><br>
38<br>
under the presence of a base, and in a temperature range from the solidifying point to the<br>
boiling point of the solvent or the solvent system. Reaction temperature is preferably<br>
-20°C to 80°C. Although reaction time can be adjusted appropriately depending on the<br>
reaction temperature, reactions can be completed in 30 minutes to 12 hours.<br>
[0122]<br>
The volume of the abovementioned reaction solvent is 1 to 100 times larger and<br>
more preferably 5 to 50 times larger in terms of volume (ml)/ weight (g) ratio with<br>
respect to the total weight of the 2 substances.<br>
[0123]<br>
Although the charged mole ratio of the aforementioned 2 substances is<br>
preferably 1: 1 when the condition is for a general N-benzylation reaction, more<br>
favorable results can be obtained by increasing the amount of one substance, which is<br>
more readily available than the other. When using the kinetic resolution method, the<br>
ratio of an optically active substance and racemic substance is preferably 1: 2 to 1: 5 and<br>
more preferably 1: 2 to 1: 3.<br>
[0124]<br>
The amount of base used is preferably 1 to 6 equivalent and more preferably 1 to<br>
3 equivalent of the leaving group Y2, which is present in the reaction system, when the<br>
condition is for a general N-benzylation reaction. When using the kinetic resolution<br>
method, the amount of base used is preferably 1 to 6 equivalent and more preferably 1 to<br>
3 equivalent of the leaving group Y2, which is present in the reaction system, if an<br>
azepine derivative is an optically active substance, and the amount of base used is<br>
preferably 0 to 4 equivalent and more preferably 0 to 1 equivalent of the leaving group<br>
Y2, which is present in the reaction system, if the azepine derivative is a racemic<br>
substance.<br><br>

The compound (1) which is produced as such can provide a reaction product<br>
having a high optical purity when used as a phase transfer catalyst in the asymmetric<br>
alkylation of an a-amino acid derivative.<br>
