				<td>LOW SWAGE LOAD FASTENING SYSTEM AND METHOD<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
1.	Field<br>
The present invention relates to fasteners and, more specifically, to a<br>
fastening system including a multi-piece, swage-type fastener and a swage tool<br>
therefore, which exhibit an optimum balance of low swage load and high strength.<br>
The invention also relates to a simplified installation method using a low swage<br>
load fastening system.<br>
2.	Related Art<br>
In many commercial applications, two-piece threaded or swaged fasteners,<br>
commonly referred to as lockbolts, are commonly used to secure a number of<br>
workpieces together. See, e.g. U.S. Patent Nos. 2,531,048; 3,215,024; 3,915,053;<br>
4,472,096; and 5,090,852. The material properties (e.g., without limitation, tensile<br>
strength and hardness) of these fasteners varies depending on the commercial<br>
application in which the fasteners will be used. To distinguish the varying<br>
properties of fasteners, the fasteners are typically designated by Grade. The<br>
Grade of a fastener is indicative of its strength. Industry standards establish the<br>
requisite strength of a fastener in order to meet a particular Grade, with the<br>
i strength of a particular fastener being determined by the strength of the material of<br>
the fastener bolt or pin. For example, a 1/2 inch Grade 5 fastener has a 1/2 inch<br>
diameter pin or bolt shank portion for use in a nominal 1/2 inch diameter workpiece<br>
opening and, in accordance with SAE J429, Grade 5 or ASTM A-325, such Grade<br>
5 fastener must have a minimum tensile strength of 120 KSI.    By way of<br>
i comparison, in order to qualify as a Grade 8 fastener, per SAE J429, Grade 8 or<br>
ASTM A-490, the fastener must have a minimum tensile strength of 150 KSI.<br>
Grade 5 fasteners are often used, for example, in railroad (e.g., railcar)<br>
applications. Grade 8 fasteners are commonly employed in commercial<br>
transportation applications, for example, to secure truck components within the<br>
commercial trucking industry.<br>
Typically swage-type fasteners include a pin and a collar. Most of these<br>
fasteners are of the pull-type variety and include a pin shank with a locking portion<br>
having lock grooves and a pull portion having pull grooves. The pull grooves are<br>
adapted to be gripped by matching teeth in chuck jaws of an installation tool with a<br>
swage anvil. The swage anvil is adapted to engage the collar and apply a relative<br>
axial force between the pin and collar, and to move over the collar and swage it<br>
into the lock grooves. The relative axial force comprises a combination of the<br>
tensile load on the pin caused by the chuck jaws and the compressive load on the<br>
collar caused by the swage anvil. The pull portion of many swage-type fasteners<br>
is connected to the lock groove portion by a breakneck groove of reduced<br>
strength. The breakneck groove is adapted to fracture at a preselected magnitude<br>
of axial or tensile force which is greater than that required to swage the collar.<br>
Accordingly, the pull portion, or pintail, will be severed and removed from the pin<br>
shank after completion of swaging. Other swage fasteners, however, have pull<br>
portions which remain on the pin after completion of installation. See. e.g., U.S.<br>
Patent No. 5,315,755, 5,548,889 and 5,604,968 (disclosing a threaded pull portion<br>
which is not severed from the pin). In other words, these fasteners are pintail-less.<br>
See, e.g., Figures 1-8 of the 755 patent.<br>
Among the problems frequently encountered with swage-type fasteners of<br>
relatively high strength (e.g., Grade 5 and above), is the excessive magnitude of<br>
applied tensile load required in order to fully swage the collar. This results in<br>
premature wear of the installation tool, particularly the pulling mechanism, and<br>
also stripping of the pull grooves on the pin.    The  high swage load  also<br>
complicates the installation process in general, especially where manually<br>
operated installation tools are used. In an attempt to overcome some of these<br>
disadvantages, a variety of different installation tool modifications have been<br>
made. For example, U.S. Patent No. 4,299,519, which is hereby incorporated<br>
herein by reference as if fully set forth herein, discloses an acorn-shaped pin pull<br>
portion and complimentary shaped tool gripping structure which are intended to<br>
provide engagement of all of the pull grooves ofthe pull portion by the gripping<br>
structure of the tool and, thereby resist stripping of the pull grooves. See, e.g.,<br>
Figures 1-5 of the '519 patent. Other tools merely incorporate hydraulic and/or<br>
pneumatic piston-cylinders, in order to assist in applying the necessary swaging<br>
force. See, e.g., U.S. Patent Nos. 4,597,2613 and 4,878,372. However, this adds<br>
size and weight to the tool, which can make it awkward to handle or limit<br>
accessibility thereby potentially jeopardizing its precise application to drive the<br>
fastener and thus the quality of the final installation. Accordingly, there is room for<br>
improvement of the installation tool and method for swage-type fastening systems.<br>
The high swage load is largely the result of the use of fastener collars which<br>
have an increased wall thickness and are thus structured to overfill or overpack<br>
the lock grooves in order to achieve the requisite strength, for a particular fastener<br>
Grade (e.g., Grade 5 and Grade 8). See, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,090,852, supra,<br>
(disclosing a modified pin thread form to include shallow grooves and a<br>
streamlined root contour, with the collar having an increased wall thickness with<br>
sufficient material to overpack such shallow grooves, in order to achieve the<br>
requisite shear strength); see also the '755 patent, supra, and U.S. Patent Nos.<br>
5,548,889 and 5,604,968 (disclosing a shallow pin groove construction and a<br>
collar shank with a volume having an excess of material of at least 16% in order to<br>
overpack the grooves). Overpacking of the lock grooves is problematic. It is a<br>
primary source of the aforementioned undesirable excessively high swage load.<br>
Accordingly, several attempts have been made, through variations in swage-type<br>
fastener design, to combat these disadvantages and, in particular, the prohibitively<br>
high swage load.<br>
For example, U.S. Patent Nos. 6,233,802 and 6,497,024, which are hereby<br>
incorporated herein by reference as if fully set forth herein, disclose a fastening<br>
system for a two-piece, swage-type fastener having a wide, shallow lock groove<br>
thread form which is designed to permit the fastener to be installed at a lower<br>
swage load than a conventional swage-type fastener of comparable Grade yet<br>
retain essentially the same physical properties (e.g., tensile strength; clamp load)<br>
when installed. The lower swage load permits the advantageous use of a smaller,<br>
lighter weight installation tool. The system is described as applied to fasteners<br>
having pintails as well as pintail-less fasteners. For pull-type swage fasteners<br>
having threaded pull portions which are not severed, as in the 755 patent, supra,<br>
the invention is stated to facilitate the engagement of fewer threads on the pull<br>
portion because the extra force required to fracture a breakneck, is hot required.<br>
This is said to (1) result in less stress on the engaged threads of the mating<br>
threaded thimble or nut member of the pull tool, thereby extending tool life; (2)<br>
permit the use of a shorter, less expensive pin because less pin protrusion is<br>
required in order to grip the reduced number of pull grooves which must be<br>
gripped; and (3) permit the installation tool to be smaller and thus lighter and less<br>
expensive, because lower applied loads are required for final installation. The<br>
system also facilitates the use of an internal drive. See, e.g., Figures 17 and 18 of<br>
the '755 patent (illustrating an internal drive including a threaded pull rod or spindle<br>
engageable within the pull grooves of a threaded bore in the end of the pin shank).<br>
As described in the 755 patent and U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,548,889 and 5,604,968,<br>
which are hereby incorporated herein by reference as if fully set forth herein, use<br>
of such internal drive allows for a reduction in protrusion relative to the external<br>
drive which, in turn, provides for a more efficient final fit and appearance of the<br>
fastener.<br>
However, as disclosed in the '024 patent, supra, in order to achieve the<br>
foregoing benefits, it was necessary to change the thread form (e.g., lock groove<br>
structure) to a wider and shallower configuration. Although revising the thread<br>
form is a viable option to reduce swage load, the thread forth disclosed in the '024<br>
patent is a drastic change requiring significantly larger pitch and a plurality of<br>
different radii with a relatively abrupt and discontinuous transition among the radii<br>
(e.g. from one radius to another). Producing pins with the disclosed thread form<br>
is, therefore, difficult and cost intensive. Additionally, the discontinuous transition<br>
among radii of the thread form prevents maximizing the complimentary<br>
engagement of the thread form by the collar grooves, when the fastener is<br>
swaged. There, therefore, is also room for further improvement in the thread form<br>
for pin lock grooves.<br>
Additionally, collars of the type disclosed in the '802 and '024 patents have<br>
a very narrow range of acceptable hardness, because too much hardness results<br>
in a prohibitively high swage load and too little hardness has insufficient strength.<br>
This is particularly problematic with respect to higher Grade fasteners (e.g., Grade<br>
5 and above) with which an increase in hardness of both the bolt and collar is<br>
required in order to meet industry tensile strength requirements. Accordingly,<br>
known collars must be subjected to a thermal process in order to be soft enough to<br>
swage and be compatible with the revised thread form, but strong enough to meet<br>
industry Grade standards. This adds still further cost and complexity to the<br>
manufacture of the fastener. For example, two such thermal processing methods<br>
include stress relieving and quench and tempering; obtaining consistent desired<br>
hardness by stress relieving is very difficult to accomplish and quench and<br>
tempering is expensive and difficult to accomplish without undesirably carburizing<br>
or decarburizing the surface of the collars. Both methods are time and cost<br>
intensive, requiring, for example, the added expense of furnace operating costs.<br>
It is, therefore, highly desirable to provide a high-strength, low swage load<br>
fastening system which exhibits, among other attributes, all of the benefits of the<br>
low swage fasteners disclosed in the '519, 755, '802, and '024 patents, supra, but<br>
which, also does not require, for example, cost and time intensive thermal<br>
processing of the collar.<br>
There is, therefore, room for improvement in the art of high-strength, low<br>
swage load fastening systems.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a swage-type fastener that<br>
exhibits an optimum balance of reduced swage load and high strength.<br>
It is another object of the present invention to provide a fastener that<br>
employs an as-headed collar, which does not need to be thermally processed<br>
(e.g., quench and tempered; stress relieved).<br>
It is another object of the present invention to provide a high-strength collar<br>
with a reduced wall thicKness, thereby reducing weight and the swage load,<br>
accordingly, while maintaining strength.<br>
It is a further object of the present invention to provide an as-headed collar<br>
having sufficient physical properties (e.g., hardness; strength), in order to meet a<br>
desired fastener Grade (e.g., Grade 5; Grade 8).<br>
It is another object of the invention to provide a collar which may be<br>
employed with existing fasteners and thread forms thereof, while exhibiting the<br>
requisite strength of the desired Grade (e.g., without limitation, Grade 5; Grade 8).<br>
It is another object of the present invention to reduce the swage load<br>
necessary to  set the fastener,  thereby decreasing  wear of installation  tool<br>
components (e.g., without limitation, the swage anvil; thimbles; half shells) and<br>
increasing tool life.<br>
It is yet another object of the present invention to provide a fastener which<br>
eliminates expensive thermal processing steps (e.g., stress relieving; quench and<br>
tempering) of the fastener collar.<br>
It is still another object of the present invention to provide a collar which is<br>
employable with a wide variety of swage-type fasteners expressly including, but<br>
not limited to fasteners with a pintail and pintail-less fasteners, such fasteners<br>
being new or part of an existing inventory with which the collar is retrofittable.<br>
It is another object of the present invention to increase the collar hardness<br>
in order to maintain or improve the collar strength level, but decrease the swage<br>
load by not overpacking the lock grooves of the fastener pin.<br>
It is a further object of the invention to provide an improved fastener lock<br>
groove thread form designed to overcome disadvantages experienced by known<br>
shallow or waveform thread forms.<br>
It is another object of the invention to provide a lock groove thread form<br>
which is structured to reduce swage load, while being relatively easy and thus<br>
economical to make.<br>
It is yet another object of the invention to provide a complimentary pull<br>
groove and tool gripping structure configuration which provides, among other<br>
benefits, one or more of the advantages of improving engagement between the<br>
pull grooves and gripping structure, extending fatigue life of the gripping structure<br>
(e.g., thimble) by, for example, decreasing the diameter of the pin pulling section<br>
and increasing the thimble cross-section and thus the thickness and strength of<br>
the pulling threads, and minimal protrusion length of the pull portion of the pin.<br>
Therefore, it is a general object of the present invention to provide an<br>
improved, high-strength, swage type fastener and as-headed collar therefor, which<br>
can be installed at a reduced swage load with existing tooling and which exhibit<br>
optimum material properties (e.g., hardness; strength) of the desired fastener<br>
Grade, and to provide a low swage load fastening system comprising one or more<br>
of, the as-headed collar, an improved pin pull portion and installation tool<br>
configuration, and a superior fastener thread form.<br>
These objects, and others, are met by the present invention which provides<br>
a low swage load fastening system and method.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, the fastener of the system may include<br>
a collar having increased hardness and a reduced collar wall thickness adapted to<br>
avoid overpacking the lock grooves. The collar is very economical to produce and<br>
easier to swage when compared with known fasteners of comparable Grade. This<br>
is because the collar of the present invention is employed as-headed, thereby<br>
eliminating the costly requirement of a thermal treatment (e.g., quench and<br>
tempering; stress relieving). The collar also does not require modification to the<br>
pin lock groove thread form. It is, therefore, readily employable with existing pins<br>
and installation tools having a variety of different lock groove thread loans, and its<br>
reduced swage load, which is attributable to its thin wall, extends installation tool<br>
life and/or allows lighter weight tooling. The fastener and collar therefor of the<br>
present invention, exhibit all of the foregoing advantages while further providing<br>
the surprising and unexpected high-strength capability sufficient to meet Grade 5<br>
and Grade 8 industry fastener standards.<br>
Accordingly, the low swage load fastening system is for a swage-type<br>
fastener structured to secure a plurality of workpieces together. The swage-type<br>
fastener includes a pin member having an elongated pin shank adapted to be<br>
located in aligned openings in the workpieces. The pin member terminates at one<br>
end in an enlarged head adapted to engage a surface on one side of the<br>
workpieces and at its opposite end in a grooved portion adapted to extend past an<br>
opposite surface on the opposite side of the workpieces. The grooved portion of<br>
the pin comprises a locking portion having a plurality of lock grooves defined by<br>
circumferentially extending pin grooves and associated pin shoulders terminating<br>
in pin crests.<br>
The fastener may be selected from the group consisting of pintail fasteners<br>
and pintail-less fasteners. The grooved portion of the pin of the fastener may be<br>
pintail-less and include an internal threaded bore wherein the installation tool<br>
includes an internal drive structured to threadingly engage the internal bore during<br>
swaging of the fastener.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, the low swage load fastening<br>
system includes a pin having a substantially straight pull portion extending from<br>
the second end of the pin and including a plurality of pull grooves. The pull portion<br>
has an outer diameter which is smaller than the outer diameter of the locking<br>
portion of the pin. An associated installation tool has a collet with a pull section for<br>
complimentarily engaging the pull grooves of the pull portion. The protrusion<br>
length of pull portion from the end of the pin is relatively short. Therefore, the pull<br>
portion may remain on the pin after swaging or may be removed by shaving it off<br>
or fracture of a breakneck groove that is optionally provided on the pin. The<br>
reduced diameter of the pull portion permits the installation tools to be thicker and<br>
stronger. The straight nature of the pull portion provides superior engagement by<br>
the installation tool.<br>
The first tooth of the pull section of the installation tool may have a greater<br>
diameter than the remainder of the teeth of the tool, which extends the tool life.<br>
The tool may be further improved, and the swage load further reduced, by<br>
including a relatively small swage load.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the low swage load fastening system, the<br>
fastener pin may include a thread form defined by a number of blended radii<br>
having a substantially smooth transition between each radius of the grooves of the<br>
thread form. Thereby improving engagement of the grooves by the collar, when it<br>
is swaged. Such a thread form eliminates complexities in the thread rolling dies<br>
used to roll the threads.<br>
In another aspect of the disclosure there is a low swage load fastening<br>
system for a swage-type fastener structured to secure a plurality of workpieces<br>
together. The swage-type fastener includes a pin member having an elongated<br>
pin shank adapted to be located in aligned openings in the workpieces. The pin<br>
member terminates at one end in an enlarged head adapted to engage a surface<br>
on one side of the workpieces and at its opposite end in a grooved portion adapted<br>
to extend past an opposite surface on the opposite side of the workpieces.<br>
The grooved portion comprises a locking portion having a plurality of lock<br>
grooves defined by circumferentially extending pin grooves and associated pin<br>
shoulders terminating in pin crests.<br>
An installation tool includes an anvil member with a swage cavity. There is<br>
an as-headed collar including a generally straight collar shank adapted to be<br>
swaged into said lock grooves on said pin member in response to a relative axial<br>
force or swage load applied between said pin member and said as-headed collar<br>
by said installation tool.<br>
A desired magnitude of clamp load on the workpieces which are fastened<br>
together define a fastened joint. The swage cavity of said installation tool is<br>
structured to engage said collar shank and to swage it radially inward. The as-<br>
headed collar when swaged, has collar grooves and shoulders interlocking said<br>
pin grooves and shoulders. The pin member and said as-headed collar is of<br>
different materials having ultimate shear stresses of different magnitudes in order<br>
that yielding of said pin member is substantially avoided upon swaging said collar<br>
to said pin member,<br>
The collet has a protrusion from said collet thereby extending the length of<br>
the pull section in a direction towards the collar thereby to increase the contact<br>
area with said anvil.<br>
The as-headed collar does not require thermal processing, and the<br>
generally straight collar shank of said as-headed collar has a wall thickness which<br>
is relatively thin thereby reducing the swage load required to said as-headed<br>
collar.<br>
The protrusion forms a flat circular face ahead of and adjacent to the<br>
leading thread of the collet, and then a circular forwardly angled face ahead of the<br>
flat face, and a second flat face, and an angular flat face back tow a line of<br>
intersection with the outer diameter of the collet.<br>
The end of the pull is not rolled down to a diameter position in line with the<br>
base of the groove thereby to increase the shear strength of the end pull crest of<br>
the pull.<br>
In yet a different aspect the last pull crest of the pull have a contour to<br>
conform with an enlarged puller radius of the last tooth of the collet.<br>
All of the foregoing low swage load mechanisms may be employed<br>
individually or in any suitable combination. A swage-type fastener, and a method<br>
of securing a plurality of work pieces together using the aforementioned low swage<br>
load system, are also disclosed.<br><br>

Detailed Description<br>
Directional phrases used herein, such as upper, lower, front, back, etc.,<br>
relate to the orientation of the elements shown in the drawings and are not limiting<br>
upon the claims.<br>
As used herein, the term "number" refers to one or more than one (e.g., a<br>
plurality).<br>
As employed herein, the term "as-headed" refers to a collar which is strain<br>
hardened, for example, from cold working, rather than changing hardness using a<br>
thermal process (e.g., quench and tempering; stress relieving). The collars of the<br>
present invention exhibit high strength (e.g., Grade 5 or 8 strength), without<br>
requiring thermal processing.<br>
As used herein the phrase "low swage load," is used for comparative<br>
purposes to describe the reduction in required swage load afforded by the features<br>
{e.g., as-headed collar; reduced diameter pintail pull portion; modified thread form)<br>
of the fastening system of the present invention in comparison with known<br>
fasteners of a similar Grade. Representative examples of such low or reduced<br>
swage load are quantified in the tables and corresponding disclosure herein.<br>
Similarly, as used herein, the phrase "reduced wall thickness" is used for<br>
comparative purposes to describe the thinner wall structure of the collar of the<br>
present invention in comparison with collars of known fasteners of similar Grade.<br>
For example, the wall thickness of the exemplary collar is of reduced thickness,<br>
having less volume of material and thus being structured not to overpack the lock<br>
grooves, unlike many known fasteners.<br>
As employed herein, the term "pull portion" refers to the exemplary pin pull<br>
portion of the fastener pin and complimentary installation tool pull section for<br>
engaging the same. As will be discussed herein, the exemplary pull portion<br>
configuration comprises a substantially straight, reduced diameter, parallel side<br>
pull portion which protrudes less distance from the end of the lock groove portion<br>
of the pin than, for example, the tapered, acorn-shaped pull portion and<br>
complimenting tool section of U.S. Patent No. 4,299,519, which is incorporated<br>
herein.<br>
As employed herein, the phrase "thread form" refers to the exemplary<br>
improved pin lock groove thread form of the invention. The novel thread form is a<br>
hybrid in that, among other new features, the thread form is, in part, a hybrid of<br>
certain features of various thread forms. It will, however, be appreciated that<br>
various testing and experimentation was required in order to develop the<br>
exemplary hybrid thread form and achieve the associated advantages attributable<br>
thereto.<br>
While examples of fasteners of the present invention are defined with<br>
reference to certain specific sizes, i.e., nominal diameters, the concepts can be<br>
readily extended to fasteners over a wide range of sizes (e.g., diameters; lengths).<br>
As shown in Figures 1-3 and 7, the present invention relates to<br>
multi-component (e.g., pin and collar) swage-type fasteners, such as, for example,<br>
the fasteners shown and described in the '024 patent, supra, which has been<br>
incorporated herein by reference. In Figures 1-3, 6B, 6C and 7 comparable<br>
fastener components are numbered the same in each of the Figures, but include<br>
the distinguishing designation of the letter "a" (Figure 2), "b" (Figure 3) "c" (Figure<br>
6B) and "d" (Figure 6C and 7) and, unless described otherwise, can be considered<br>
to be substantially the same. A first feature of the exemplary low swage load<br>
fastening system 50, an as-headed collar 14 is shown as employed on each of the<br>
fasteners 10, 10a, 10b, 10c and 10d of Figures 1, 2 and 3, 6B, 6C and 7<br>
respectively.<br>
Figure 1 shows a fastener 10 including a pin member 12 with a pintail 41<br>
and the as-headed, low swage load collar 14 of the present invention. The pin<br>
member 12 has an elongated shank 15, which extends through aligned openings<br>
or bores 16 and 17 in a pair of workpieces 18, 20, respectively, which are to be<br>
secured together. An enlarged, protruding head 22 at one end of the shank 15<br>
engages the back surface 23 of workpiece 18. The shank 14 has a straight,<br>
smooth cylindrical shank portion 24 adjacent the head 22 which is adapted to be<br>
received within the aligned bores 16 and 17 with a clearance fit. However, it will<br>
be appreciated that in some installations the straight shank portion 24 can be<br>
sized to provide a close tolerance or interference fit with one or both of the bores<br>
16 and 17. Adjacent and integral with the straight shank portion 24 is a locking<br>
shank portion 25 having a plurality of circumferentially extending, annular lock<br>
grooves 26.<br>
The fastener 10 of Figure 1, as previously discussed, includes a pintail or<br>
pull shank portion 41 having a straight annular land 42 followed by a plurality of<br>
annual pull groves 44. A breakneck groove 40 having a reduced root diameter is<br>
located between the locking portion 25 and the annular land 42 of the pull portion<br>
41 and defines the weakest section on the pin shank 15, The pull portion 41,<br>
including the land 42 and pull grooves 44, is of a reduced diameter Da, relative to<br>
the diameter Db of the crests 71 of the locking grooves 26 of the locking portion<br>
25. Diameter Db is also the same as that of the straight shank portion 24. It will<br>
be appreciated, however, that, in applications involving a close tolerance or slight<br>
interference fit (not shown) with the bores 16 and 17, the crests 71 of the locking<br>
grooves 26 will be of a diameter smaller (not shown) than that of the straight shank<br>
portion 24. The pull grooves 44 are adapted to be gripped by an installation tool<br>
100 which is employed to set the fastener 10 in the manner shown and described<br>
in the '024 patent, supra.<br>
Tooling 100 required for installation (e.g., swaging) of the collar 14 can be<br>
generally constructed in a manner known to those skilled in the art and is,<br>
therefore, only partially shown for purposes of simplicity. In summary, the tool 100<br>
has a nose assembly 102 with a plurality of circumferentially spaced jaws 104<br>
adapted to grip the pull grooves 44 of the pull shank portion 41. Jaws 104 are<br>
located in a tubular collet assembly 106 which is slidably supported in an anvil<br>
housing 108, which terminates at one end in a swage anvil section 110 having a<br>
swage cavity 112. The jaws 104 are normally resiliently urged axially forward in<br>
conical tracks 114 to the radially closed position, shown, by a jaw follower<br>
assembly 116 (partially shown in Figure 1). However, it will also be appreciated<br>
that, as discussed herein, that other suitable installation configurations (see, e.g.,<br>
reduced diameter pintail pull portion 177 of Figures 7-9) and methods other than<br>
those shown and described with respect to Figures 1-3 are contemplated by the<br>
exemplary low swage load fastening system 50.<br><br>
Figures 2 and 3 show the exemplary collar 14 as employed on two<br>
representative varieties of pintail-less fasteners 10a, 10b, respectively. The<br>
Figures further illustrate how the exemplary collar 14 is readily employable with a<br>
wide variety of known installation tools. For example, Figure 2 shows an<br>
installation tool 200 including an external drive 202 with an internal threaded bore<br>
204 and a sensing rod 206. This installation tool 200 is also discussed in detail in<br>
the '024 patent, which is incorporated herein. Briefly, the external drive 202<br>
engages grooves 26a and drives or applies a relative axial force on the swage<br>
anvil 210 such that it receives the collar 14 within the swage cavity 212 and<br>
swages the collar 14 as the workpieces 18a and 20a are secured together.<br>
Figure 3 illustrates the exemplary collar 14 as employed with another type<br>
of pintail-less fastener 10b. The pin shank 15b includes an internal threaded bore<br>
77 adapted for use with an installation tool 300 including an internal drive 306 with<br>
a drive rod 302 having threads 304 corresponding to the threads of the internal<br>
bore 77. Such installation tool is also shown and described in the '024 patent. In<br>
summary, the internal drive 306 of the installation tool 300 engages the internal<br>
bore 77 of the pin shank 15b and draws the swage anvil 310 toward the collar 14<br>
such that it is received and swaged within the swage cavity 312.<br>
Accordingly, it will be appreciated that the as-headed, low swage load collar<br>
14 of the present invention may be employed with a wide variety of fasteners, and<br>
tools therefor, including fasteners of both the pintail and pintail-less varieties,<br>
which have conventional annular or helical lock groove thread forms with deeper<br>
and narrower grooves or reduced pitch in comparison with the modified thread<br>
form shown in Figures 2-3 and described in connection with the invention of the<br>
'024 patent, supra. This is a significant improvement because, as will now be<br>
briefly discussed, although the structure of the fastener of the '024 patent results in<br>
the requisite swage load being reduced to a manageable magnitude, in order to do<br>
so, it requires a drastically changed thread form and the collar is heat treated (e.g.,<br>
quench and tempered; stress relieved) in order to achieve the necessary material<br>
properties (e.g., strength). The collar 14 of the present invention, although<br>
applicable with fasteners of the aforementioned revised thread form, (see, e.g.,<br>
Figures 2-3) may also be readily employed with fasteners having a more traditional<br>
or conventional thread form with narrower and deeper lock grooves. See e.g.,<br>
Figures 7 and 7A and the accompanying disclosure in the '024 patent. As will be<br>
discussed herein, the exemplary as-headed collar 14 may also be readily<br>
employed with the improved hybrid thread form 26d (Figure 6) of the exemplary<br>
fastening system 50 of the invention.<br>
Referring to Figures 4 and 5, a known prior art collar (e.g. 14') is compared<br>
to the exemplary collar 14 of the present invention. The collar 14' includes an<br>
enlarged optional diameter flange 59' with a cylindrical shank 61' and a through<br>
bore 65'. The collar shank 61' is of a generally uniform cylindrical configuration<br>
with a generally uniform wall thickness t'. The collar 14' has a straight shank<br>
portion 69' which terminates at its outer end in a radially outwardly flared shank<br>
portion 67', also generally of thickness f.<br>
Like the exemplary collar 14 (Figures 1-3, 5 and 7) of the present invention,<br>
before being swaged, the collar 14' is adapted to be disposed over the pin shank<br>
15 (see, e.g., Figure 1) and, with the workpieces 18, 20 (Figure 1) pulled together,<br>
will have the collar shank 61' in radial alignment with the locking grooves 26<br>
(Figure 1). At the same time, the flange 59' will be in engagement with the outer<br>
surface 73 of workpiece 20. The workpieces 18 and 20 have a combined<br>
thickness t1 (Figure 1) defining a nominal grip of the fastener (e.g., 10). However,<br>
it will be appreciated that the fastener 10 can be employed over a predetermined<br>
grip range, which varies from workpieces having a minimum total thickness less<br>
than t1 (not shown) to a maximum total thickness greater than t1 (not shown).<br>
As discussed in the '024 patent, which is incorporated herein by reference,<br>
the relative axial load required to swage the collar shank 61' is minimized by<br>
reducing the clearance between the straight collar bore portion 69' of uniform<br>
diameter and the crests 71 (see, e.g.. Figure 1) of the lock grooves 26. In the<br>
invention of the '024 patent this radial clearance is significantly reduced radially to<br>
around one half of that of the conventional lockbolt. See e.g., Figure 7 of the '024<br>
patent (illustrating the thread form of a typical swage-type fastener). Because of<br>
the close radial clearance provided by the minimized inside diameter ID', the<br>
outside diameter OD' can be reduced to the thickness t' necessary to provide the<br>
desired volume. Thus, as discussed in the '024 patent, the inside diameter ID' and<br>
outer diameter OD' are selected to provide the desired wall thickness t' of collar<br>
shank 61' resulting in the necessary volume of collar material for swage and the<br>
desired amount of lock groove fill, while providing the desired reduction in swage<br>
load.<br>
However, as shown in Figures 4A, 7A, 8A and 9A of the '024 patent, and<br>
discussed in the accompanying disclosure, such fastener and collar 14' therefor,<br>
requires a modified thread form to include lock grooves 26, which are wider and<br>
generally shallower (comparing the modified groove structures shown in Figures<br>
4A, 8A and 9A of the '024 patent with the prior art fastener of Figure 7A).<br>
Additionally, although the modified fastener thread form helps overcome the<br>
aforementioned high swage load, it also requires cost intensive thermal processing<br>
of the collar 14' in order to maintain the requisite material properties (e.g.,<br>
strength).<br>
Accordingly, in view of the foregoing known attempts to improve swage-<br>
type fastener design, it has been a well recognized, long standing desire within the<br>
fastener art to provide an economical, high Grade fastener which exhibits an<br>
optimum balance of low swage load and high strength. While the aforementioned<br>
fasteners have substantially met the goal of reducing swage load, they have, thus<br>
far, only been able to do so through use of cost intensive collar heat treatment and<br>
modifications to the thread form. Among the ways that the low swage fastening<br>
system 50 of the present invention overcomes these disadvantages is by providing<br>
the aforementioned improved collar 14 which is readily employable with a wide<br>
variety of existing fasteners and thread forms thereof, and, is employable as-<br>
headed, without requiring a heat treatment, while still exhibiting high Grade (e.g.,<br>
Grade 5 and Grade 8) material properties {e.g., without limitation, strength). The<br>
collar 14 is, therefore, retroactively employable with existing fasteners as an<br>
improved stand alone component, or alternatively in combination with the other<br>
low swage features of the exemplary fastening system 50.<br>
Figure 5 shows a more detailed, isometric view of the exemplary<br>
as-headed, low swage load collar 14, which is shown as employed with fasteners<br>
10, 10a, 10b, 10c, 10d in Figures 1-3 and 7, respectively. A portion of the collar<br>
14 is cut away to illustrate the exemplary reduced wail thickness t of the collar 14<br>
(compare, for example, to thickness t' of collar 14' in Figure 4). Thus, for a<br>
fastener of comparable Grade, the collar 14 of the present invention will have an<br>
inside diameter ID substantially equivalent to the outer diameter Db of the lock<br>
groove crest 71 (Figure 1), similar to ID' of the collar 14' of Figure 4. However, the<br>
outside diameter OD of the exemplary collar 14 is less than OD' of the prior art<br>
collar 14', thereby resulting in the exemplary reduced wall thickness t of the collar<br>
shank 61. As will be discussed in greater detail herein, the reduced wall thickness<br>
t results in a smaller volume of material to be swaged into the lock grooves (e.g.,<br>
26, 26a, 26b, 26c, 26d of Figures 1-3, 6B, 6C and 7 respectively). This, in<br>
combination with the increased hardness of the exemplary collar 14, results in the<br>
lock grooves (e.g., 26, 26a, 26b, 26c, 26d) not being overpacked, which is directly<br>
opposite of many known prior art collar designs. Also, by reducing the collar ID,<br>
there is less distance traveled by the collar during swage to engage the lock<br>
grooves. Less swage load is spent in swaging the collars of the present invention<br>
into the lock grooves because the collars have less clearance from the outer<br>
diameter of the crests that the prior art. In prior art lockbolt systems, more<br>
clearance was provided between the collars and the outer diameter of the crests<br>
so that more swage load was applied to the collar to swage it through air before<br>
being swaged into the lock grooves. The reduced wall thickness t, not<br>
overpacking the lock grooves 26, 26a, 26b, 26c and 26d and reduced clearance<br>
between the collar and the outer diameter of the crests of the lock bolt reduces the<br>
relative axial load required to swage the exemplary collar 14.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention accomplishes the similar goal of reduced<br>
swage load in a more economical, improved manner than the known prior art. It<br>
will be appreciated that the exact difference or amount of reduction in the wall<br>
thickness t of the exemplary collar 14 in comparison, for example, with wall<br>
thickness t' of collar 14', will be partly dependent upon the size (e.g., without<br>
limitation, 1/2 inch, 5/8 inch, 3/4 inch) of the particular fastener at issue. For<br>
example, the difference in collar wall thickness will likely be greater between a pair<br>
of 1/2 inch fasteners of comparable Grade, than, for example between a pair of 1/4<br>
inch fasteners of comparable Grade. Examples of the effects of the reduced<br>
thickness, t, of the collar shank 61 of the present invention, as well as<br>
representative numbers for such thickness, will be further explained and<br>
appreciated through discussion of the following examples. The examples illustrate<br>
and discuss the results of several experiments conducted for the purpose of<br>
evaluating the effects of reduced collar shank 61 wall thickness t on as-headed,<br>
high-strength collars 14 and fasteners (e.g., 10, 10a, 10b, 10c and 10d). The<br>
following examples are provided to further illustrate the improvements and are not<br>
limiting upon the invention.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
The purpose of the first experiment was to determine if collars made to<br>
HS5CF-R12 dimensions could be used as-headed to meet Grade 8 values. The<br>
HS5CF-R12 fastener is a commercially available Grade 5, swage-type fastener<br>
which is manufactured by Huck International, Inc. of Waco, Texas.<br>
The experiment involved a test of the outer diameter (OD), hardness,<br>
swage load, tensile and preload of standard quench and tempered Grade 8 collars<br>
which were tested and compared against as-headed Grade 5 collars. The results<br>
are quantified in Table 1 herein below.<br>
Table 1 - Grade 5 As-Headed Collar<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
As shown in Table 1, both Collars "A" and "B" had a swage load which was<br>
18% lower than the current standard HS8CF-R12 collar, and both meet the<br>
minimum industry tensile and preload requirements of Grade 5. The experiment<br>
uncovered that the as-headed collar, Collar "A", had two distinct advantages over<br>
Collar UB":<br>
1)	Collar "A" does not require a heat treatment operation (e.g., quench and<br>
temper; stress relieve), and therefore, also does not receive an additional step of<br>
cleaning or decarburizing the collar; and<br>
2)	Collar "A" had a significantly higher preload margin above the minimum<br>
industry specification than Collar "B".<br>
Although Collar "A" did not have quite as high actual tensile and preload as<br>
the current standard Grade 5 collar, it had a significantly (18%) lower swage load.<br>
Accordingly, the test confirmed that as-headed collars having a reduced OD and<br>
thus wall thickness, in accordance with the present invention, can economically<br>
achieve a reduced swage load (18%) while exhibiting optimum material properties.<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
The second experiment arose out of the desire to develop an economical<br>
way to improve installation tool life and to reduce the cost of making Grade 8<br>
collars. Specifically, the goal of the experiment was to determine if thinner-walled,<br>
as-headed collars can increase snub load, decrease swage load, and maintain the<br>
same tensile and preload as standard quench and tempered collars. Snub load is<br>
the load at which the collar 14 first engages the pin lock grooves 26, 26a, 26b,<br>
26c, 26d. After this point, sheet (e.g., workpiece 18, 20; 18a, 20a; 18b, 20b; 18c,<br>
20c) gap pull-out is restricted because the collar 14 is stuck on the pin 12, 12a,<br>
12b 12c, 12d. If a gap remains after snub, clamping is reduced because collar<br>
elongation goes into diminishing the gap instead of stretching the pin 12, 12a, 12b,<br>
12c, 12d.<br>
HSCF-R20 collars from the same work order and raw material (50 KSI<br>
tensile) were divided into four groups. HSCF-R20 collars are commercially<br>
available collars which are manufactured by Huck International, Inc. of Waco,<br>
Texas.<br>
Group 1 was the control group and was processed in the conventional<br>
manner (e.g., by quenching and tempering). Collar OD was 1.009".<br>
Group 2 was as-headed and had the collar OD turned down to 1.000".<br>
Group 3 was as-headed and had the collar OD turned down to 0.995".<br>
Group 4 was as-headed and had the collar OD turned down to 0.990".<br>
All of the collars were shot blasted and waxed to have the same surface<br>
texture and lubricant. Additionally, the same work order of pins was used for all<br>
tests, as was the same installation tooling and the same testing instruments.<br>
Tlmee tests weie made wfth each group lot each category o1 snub load, swage<br>
load, preload and tensile. To simplify the report, only the averages of the tests are<br>
reported in Table 2 herein.Table 2:<br>
 Thin-Walled. As-Headed Collars<br><br>
(Table Removed)The collar OD tolerance range for standard collars is 1.006" to 1.012".<br>
Using the same tolerance range for as-headed collars, the allowable collar OD<br>
range is between about .995" to 1.001." As shown, the OD values in Table 2<br>
range from about 0.990" to 1.009" and can be taken as the minimum and<br>
maximum. The average values of 1.000" and .995" can, therefore, be compared<br>
directly against the 1.009" nominal values.<br>
As shown from the results quantified in Table 2, as-headed collars offer the<br>
following advantages over standard quench and tempered collars:<br>
1. Improved mechanical values: about 44% greater snub (gap pullout) load,<br>
about 11% lower swage load, about 5% more tensile strength and the same<br>
preload. Preload is about 7% above the minimum industry specification with both<br>
types of collars, but tensile strength improves from about 3% over the minimum<br>
specification to about 9% over specification when using the as-headed collar. The<br>
as-headed collar also provides a decrease in installation tool pressure of about<br>
10% to 20% which is a very significant advantage resulting in reduced tool wear,<br>
more accessible smaller tools and lighter weight tools.<br>
2.	Improved quality: Case and decarburizing problems are eliminated when<br>
collars are not quenched and tempered. Additionally, consistency of hardness<br>
remains the same because as-headed collars stay within a hardness range of<br>
about 10 Rb. It is also possible that certain quenched and tempered collars might<br>
not meet tensile requirements if hardness approaches the minimum Grade<br>
specification of Rb 68. This is not a problem with the increased hardness of the<br>
exemplary as-headed collars.<br>
3.	Reduced Cost: By eliminating heat treatment and the blast clean step,<br>
associated therewith, as-headed collars reduce manufacturing costs. Additionally,<br>
collar raw material costs can be reduced by replacing annealed AISI 1010 steel<br>
wire, which is commonly used to produce the collars, with hot-rolled AISI 1006<br>
wire, which may be used to produce the exemplary as-headed collars because it<br>
work hardens substantially the same amount as annealed AISI 1010 steel wire.<br>
As-headed collars may be made from unannealed or annealed low carbon steel. It<br>
is also unannealed and, therefore, less expensive.<br>
4.	Reduced lead time: Eliminating heat treatment and inspection associated<br>
therewith saves about two or three days of the time typically required to produce<br>
the collars.<br>
Accordingly, the results of EXAMPLE 2 further confirm the advantages of<br>
using an as-headed collar in accordance with the present invention. Additionally,<br>
when viewed in conjunction with EXAMPLE 1, the ability of the fastener and collar<br>
therefor of the present invention to reduce installation tool component (e.g., anvil;<br>
thimble) wear and thus increase tool life becomes evident. While anvil wear would<br>
be expected to increase because the exemplary as-headed collars are harder, it<br>
has been discovered through the present invention that, anvil wear will in fact does<br>
not significantly change upon reducing the OD and thus wall thickness, t, of the<br><br>
exemplary collar 14 and thimble life is increased as a result of the reduced tool<br>
pressure required.<br>
EXAMPLE 3<br>
Further to the results of the first two experiments, the third experiment<br>
further tested the effects of increasing collar hardness while decreasing collar wall<br>
thickness, in an attempt to find an optimum balance of high strength and low<br>
swage load. Gap pullout results in less than optimum clamp on the joint.<br>
However, increasing collar hardness also increases the swage force to install the<br>
collar, as evidenced in EXAMPLE 2. Decreasing the wall collar thickness lowers<br>
the swage force disproportionately more than the snub (gap pullout) load.<br>
Accordingly, combining the discoveries of the foregoing experiments, this<br>
experiment was intended to overcome known fastener design limitations by<br>
balancing increased collar hardness with a decrease in collar wall thickness in<br>
order to maintain the same tensile and preload and increase snub load while<br>
decreasing the swage load, thereby improving installation tool life. It was also a<br>
goal of the experiment to accomplish the foregoing without making a change to the<br>
standard pin or installation tool in order to keep potential future changeover to the<br>
new collar as simple and cost effective as possible.<br>
For consistency, the same work order of collars was used throughout the<br>
test. Collar wall thickness was decreased by machining down the collar OD in<br>
.010" increments. Snub load, swage load, ejection load, preload and tensile<br>
strength were inspected for the optimum wall thickness. The most consistent way<br>
to significantly raise collar hardness, as learned from EXAMPLES 1 and 2, was to<br>
leave the collars as-headed, which gave a net hardness increase of between<br>
about 20-25 Rb points. Once the optimum collar wall thickness was determined,<br>
the same tests were done to compare standard pins with pins of the type<br>
described hereinbefore in connection with the 024 patent, the latter having been<br>
heat treated to the same hardness and pinbreak. This was done to determine the<br>
effect of lock groove form. All testing was done on production test equipment<br>
using standard test procedures.<br>
To simplify the report and because there was insignificant variation between<br>
tests, only the average value of three tests for each condition is reported. Table 3<br>
herein shows the result of the exemplary reduced collar wall thickness when<br>
employed with pins of a standard thread form.<br>
Table 3 - Reduced Collar Wall Thickness Standard Thread Form<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
As can be calculated from Table 3, a calculated as-headed hard collar OD<br>
of .975" would give identical clamp and tensile values as the current standard<br>
collar, but snub load would increase about 54%, and swage load would decrease<br>
about 6%. These results further confirm the attributes of the fastener and as-<br>
headed, thin-walled, low swage load collars therefor, of the present invention.<br>
Snub, clamp and tensile data for standard lock grooves (e.g., of the type<br>
discussed with reverence to Figures 7 and 7A of the '024 patent) from this group<br>
validate the first group of data in Table 3. Swage load was about 1,300 lbs lower<br>
than predicted, or about a 12% reduction instead of the original 6% reduction.<br>
There was no significant difference in values due to lock groove thread form.<br>
There was a significant (about 40%) reduction of swage load associated with a<br>
revised hybrid lock groove in combination with the hard, thin wall as-headed collar<br>
with comparison to the swage loads associated with a standard helical lock groove<br>
thread form and a quench and tempered collar.<br>
In summary, the experiment confirms that hardness can be increased<br>
consistently by using as-headed collars and collar wall thickness can be reduced<br>
because hoop strength is increased from such higher hardness. Reducing the OD<br>
of the collar to about .975" creates no change in actual preload or tensile values,<br>
but increases gap pullout by about 50% and decreases swage by about 10%.<br>
Increased hardness of about 20 Rb points also increases calculated wear<br>
resistance of the collar by about 40%, and no change is necessary in the pin or<br>
swage anvil in order to swage the as-headed collars. Accordingly, not only do the<br>
fasteners and collars therefor of the fastening system 50 of the present invention<br>
exhibit optimized physical properties, low swage load and economic efficiency, but<br>
the collars 14 may also be readily employed with a wide variety of existing fastener<br>
pins and thread forms thereof as well as with the improved hybrid thread form 26d<br>
(Figure 6C.) of the invention.<br>
It is desirable that the pin 12, 12a, 12b, 12c, 12d (Figures 1-3, 6B, 6C and<br>
7), be hard enough relative to the hardness of the collar 14 to resist crushing or<br>
excessive yielding in tension or necking down from the compressive swage loads.<br>
Therefore, in one form of the invention, for example, for the Grade 5 type fastener,<br>
the pin 12, 12a, 12b, 12c, 12d could be made of AISI 1038 steel or AIS11541 steel<br>
or other comparable materials for the same Grade having a hardness of between<br>
about Rc24 to about Rc35 and an ultimate tensile strength of at least 120 KSI.<br>
Typically, conventional collars (e.g., 14') for such fasteners were made from AISI<br>
1010 carbon steel, which had to be thermally processed to between about Rb65 to<br>
Rb85 and an ultimate tensile strength of at least about 60 KSI.<br>
However, as previously discussed, the exemplary collar 14 is made, for<br>
example, from AISI 1006 steel or any other suitable annealed or unannealed low<br>
carbon steel material. The AISI 1006 steel is not annealed. Unannealed steel<br>
wire, commonly referred to as "green" wire, is less expensive thereby making the<br>
exemplary collar 14 more economical to produce. The pin 12, 12a, 12b, 12c, 12d<br>
has a sufficient hardness to accept both the high tensile preloads desired and the<br>
swage loads on the collar 14 without substantially yielding. In addition the collar<br>
14, like the collars discussed, for example, in the '024 patent, can be coated with a<br>
conventional lubricant such as a water soluble polyethelene wax or cetyl alcohol.<br>
The collar 14 could also be zinc plated. This assists in maintaining swage loads at<br>
the desired low level and also minimizes wear of the swage cavity 112, 212, 312,<br>
412. Thus, as shown through EXAMPLES 1-3, the shank 61 (Figure 5) of collar<br>
14 is provided with a sufficient wall thickness t and, thus volume, in order to insure<br>
that enough collar material will move axially in elongation, but at the same time it<br>
will have sufficient strength, such that the pin shoulders 60 (Figure 1) and collar<br>
shoulders, formed during swage, remain in substantially full engagement as the<br>
design tensiie load on the joint is reached. In this regard, the required wall<br>
thickness t (Figure 5) of the exemplary collar shank 61 will increase slightly for<br>
larger diameter fasteners and decrease for smaller diameter fasteners, while<br>
remaining thin enough to exhibit the advantages discovered through the present<br>
invention, and thinner than known prior art collars of comparable size and Grade.<br>
Table 4 further summarizes the improvements of collar 14 by way of a comparison<br>
between known quench and tempered collars 14' and the as-headed collar 14 of<br>
the invention as employed with known Grade 5 and Grade 8 fasteners 10, 10a,<br>
10b, 10c, 10d and with the improved Grade 5 and Grade 8 fasteners 10c, 10d<br>
(Figures 6 and 7) of the exemplary low swage load fastening system 50. The<br>
various collar dimensions are shown for three different nominal fastener sizes 1/2<br>
inch, 5/8 inch, and 1/2 inch. For the first-two types of fastener, the collar<br>
dimensions of the existing quenched and tempered collar 14' are shown first with<br>
the values of the as-headed collar 14 of the invention shown indented and offset to<br>
the right. Only the as-headed collar valves are shown for the Grade 5 and Grade<br>
8 fasteners labeled "Next Generation". These fasteners employ the exemplary<br>
hybrid thread form 126 (Figure 6C) of the invention, which will be discussed<br>
herein.<br>
Table 4: Dollar Dimension; Comparison<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
As shown in Table 4, it has been found with the as-headed collar of the<br>
present invention that the ratio of the O.D. to the I.D. of an as-headed collar is<br>
about: (i) 1.491 for an existing 5/8 inch Grade 5 fastener, (ii) 1.540 for an existing<br>
5/8 inch Grade 8 fastener, (iii) 1.481 for a 5/8 inch next generation Grade 5<br>
fastener, and (IV) 1.502 for a 5/8 inch next generation Grade 8 fastener. A<br>
suitable range of the ratio of O.D. to I.D. for a collar of the present invention would<br>
likely be about 1.47 to 1.55 or any other range falling within that range. Additional<br>
exemplary embodiments of ranges are not set forth for the purpose of simplifying<br>
the specification. With the prior art quench and tempered collars, it was found that<br>
the ratio of O.D. to I.D. of the collar is about: (i) 1.509 for a 5/8 inch Grade 5<br>
fastener and (ii) 1.557 for a 5/8 inch Grade 8 fastener.<br>
The reduction in swage load permits a reduction in the size of the<br>
installation tool (e.g., 100, 200, 300 of Figures 1-3, respectively; see also<br>
installation tool 400 of Figures 7-9) resulting in a corresponding reduction in weight<br>
of up to 40% compared to the weight of conventional installation tools. See, e.g.,<br>
the '024 patent, supra, (discussing tool weight reduction as compared to the tool<br>
148 of Figure 7, therein).<br>
In view of the fact that many fasteners (e.g., 10, 10a, 10b, 10c, 10d) with<br>
which the collar 14 of the present invention may be employed, have pull portions<br>
and/or pintails of reduced size and/or length, it may be desirable to provide a<br>
mechanism for holding the pin and collar together when first pre-assembling it to<br>
workpieces, in preparation for installation. Therefore, the collar may optionally be<br>
provided with a flexible pre-assembly tab 90 (Figure 5). See, e.g., U.S. Patent No.<br>
4,813,834. The structure and operation of the optional assembly tab 90, if<br>
employed, would be much the same as disclosed in the '834 patent, supra, such<br>
disclosure being hereby incorporated herein by reference as if fully set forth<br>
herein. Briefly, the assembly tab 90 is located in the countersunk bore portion 55<br>
of collar 14 and is of a limited circumferential length. The assembly tab 90, as<br>
noted in the '834 patent, supra, is preferably of a flexible construction and, as<br>
such, can be made of a plastic material such as, for example, polyurethane. The<br>
tab 90 extends radially inwardly a distance sufficient to be located within the lock<br>
grooves such as grooves 26, 26a, 26b, 26c, 26d. In this manner, once located in<br>
one of the lock grooves, the collar 14 will be held onto the associated pin 12, 12a,<br>
12b, 12c, 12d. The tab 90 is located within the countersunk bore portion 55 which<br>
is at a point in line with the flange 59. Optional tab 90 facilitates movement of the<br>
collar 14 onto the pin and the indexing of the tab 90 over the lock groove crests. It<br>
will be appreciated that the tab 90 could alternatively be located at the opposite<br>
end of the collar 14. It will also be appreciated that the collar need not employ the<br>
optional tab 90.<br>
It will also be appreciated that one or more portions of the collar 14 may be<br>
of a different configuration than that which is shown and described in herein. For<br>
example, the collar could be flangeless (not shown) or may have a flange of<br>
reduced size (not shown) and/or the collar might not include the countersink bore<br>
portion 55. Additionally, the collar 14 may optionally include such a countersink<br>
bore portion at the opposite end of the collar (not shown). It will also be<br>
appreciated that, as discussed in U.S. Patent No. 4,867,625, the optional<br>
assembly tab (e.g., 90) may comprise a more substantial, limited thread (not<br>
shown) of a preselected extent such that some magnitude of initial clamp of the<br>
workpieces can be attained in addition to holding the collar 14 and associated pin<br>
in a pre-assembled condition with the workpieces. See e.g., the '625 patent<br>
(incorporated herein by reference the disclosure relating to the limited female<br>
thread as if fully set forth herein).<br>
Another means by which the low swage load fastening system 50 of the<br>
invention reduces swaging loads is shown in Figure 6C and in particular, by way of<br>
comparison of Figure 6C with Figures 6A and 663. Specifically, as shown in<br>
Figure 6C, a hybrid thread form 26d is provided for the lock grooves 26d of the pin<br>
12d. which improves upon known thread forms such as the waveform lock groove<br>
26b and deep lock groove 26c examples of Figures 6A and 6B, respectively. The<br>
exemplary thread form of Figure 6C is defined by a unique hybrid of features<br>
including a number of blended radii which provide a substantially smooth transition<br>
between the crests 28d, 30d and base of the lock grooves 26d. More specifically,<br>
the first crest 28d has a first radius R1, the second crest 30d has a fourth radius<br>
R4, and two intermediate radii R2, R3 define the base portion or valley 132 of the<br>
groove 26d while simultaneously smoothly interconnecting first radius R1 and<br>
fourth radius R4. In this manner, the hybrid thread form 26d (Figure 6C) improves<br>
upon the relatively unsmooth and abrupt transition of the shallow and deep thread<br>
forms 26b, 26c of Figures 6A and 6B, respectively. In particular, the relatively<br>
shallow waveform 26b of Figure 6A requires many more radii and has a relatively<br>
discontinuous transition between and among the radii, and the deep lock groove<br>
thread form 26c of Figure 6B has a relatively sharp, unblended transition between<br>
radii. Additionally, the waveform 26b of Figure 6A has a wide pitch 36b and<br>
relatively shallow depth 38b, while the deep thread form 26c of Figure 6B<br>
conversely has a relatively narrow pitch 36c and a much larger depth 38c, as<br>
shown.<br>
As can be appreciated with continued reverence to Figures 6A and 6B,<br>
respectively, the relatively shallow waveform 26b tends to overpack when the<br>
collar 14 is swaged, which as previously discussed, disadvantageously increases<br>
swage load. Conversely, as shown, the abrupt changes in the deep thread form<br>
26c of Figure 6B tend to have the opposite effect, with less than the desired<br>
amount of engagement occurring between the lock grooves 26c of the pin 12c and<br>
the collar 14, when it is swaged.<br>
Referring now to Figure 6C and comparing the exemplary hybrid thread<br>
form 26d with thread forms 26b and 26c of Figures 6A and 6B, respectively, it will<br>
be appreciated that the hybrid thread form has a somewhat intermediate pitch 36d<br>
and depth 38d. This, in combination with the aforementioned blended radii R1,<br>
R2, R3, R4 provide a smooth, blended thread form 26d which accordingly<br>
promotes the complimentary interlocking engagement of the collar grooves 62 with<br>
the lock grooves 26d when the collar 14 is swaged, thereby reducing swage load.<br>
The advantages of the exemplary thread form 126 can be further appreciated by<br>
the following table of values, Table 5, which summarizes a non-limiting<br>
comparative example of values for three different Grade 8, 5/8 inch fasteners<br>
having pins 12b, 12c, 12d with the different thread forms 26b, 26c, 26d shown and<br>
described with respect to Figures 6A, 6B and 6C.<br>
Table 5: Thread Fore Comparison 5/8 inch Grade 8 Fastener<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
The deep lock groove thread form set forth in Table 5 was developed to<br>
reduce the problems associated with stripping the internal threaded bore 204<br>
depicted in FIG. 2. It was found that increasing the depth of the lock grooves 26c<br>
was helpful in reducing damage to the internal threaded bore 204. Thereafter, it<br>
was determined that deep lock grooves 26c were not necessary with a pull type<br>
mechanism 177 of the type shown in FIG. 7. The hybrid lock groove thread form<br>
set forth in Table 5 was developed for use with the pull mechanism 177 of the type<br>
shown in FIG. 7.<br>
As shown, the hybrid lock groove thread form 26d (Figure 6C) has a<br>
relatively intermediate depth 38d and pitch 36d when compared with the waveform<br>
and deep lock groove thread forms 26b, 26c, respectively, while achieving all of<br>
the foregoing advantages, including maintaining a reduced swage load generally<br>
comparable to the deep lock groove 26c of Figure 6B. It will also be appreciated<br>
that the exemplary hybrid thread form 26d could be employed in combination with<br>
the aforementioned as-headed collar 14, in order to even further reduce swage<br>
loads. By way of example, for the 5/8 inch Grade 8 fastener of Figure 6C and<br>
table 5, a reduction in swage load of about 11% from the wave form lock groove<br>
can be expected when the exemplary hybrid thread form 26d of Figure 6C is used<br>
in combination with the aforementioned as-headed collar 14. Also, for the 5/8 inch<br>
Grade 8 fastener of Figure 6C and Table 5, a reduction in swage load of about<br>
40% from a standard helical lock groove thread form can be expected when the<br>
exemplary hybrid thread form 26d of Figure 6C is used in combination with the<br>
aforementioned as-headed collar 14.<br>
It has been found with the as-headed collar of the present invention that the<br>
ratio of the shear strength between a pin and a collar is about: (i) 1.8 for a Grade 8<br>
fastener and (ii) 1.6 for a Grade 5 fastener. A suitable range of the ratio of shear<br>
strengths between a pin and a collar of the present invention would likely be about<br>
1.5 to 2.1 or any other range falling within that range. Additional exemplary<br>
embodiments of ranges are not set forth for the purpose of simplifying the<br>
specification. With the prior art quench and tempered collars, it was found that the<br>
ratio of shear strength between a pin and a collar is about: (i) 2.5 for a Grade 8<br>
fastener and (ii) 2.2 for a Grade 5 fastener.<br><br>
It has also been found with the as-headed collar of the present invention<br>
that the lock grooves are typically packed: (i) about 40% for the deep lock groove<br>
26c thread form and about 60% for the hybrid lock groove 26d thread form for a<br>
Grade 8 fastener and (ii) about 30% for the deep lock groove 26c thread form and<br>
about 50% for the hybrid lock groove 26d thread form for a Grade 5 fastener. Use<br>
of the deeper lock groove with less than an overpacking of the lock grooves has<br>
been found desirable from the standpoint of accommodating painted finishes that<br>
are applied to the pin which accumulate in the troughs of the lock grooves.<br>
It has also been found that the typical ratio of the pitch length to the depth<br>
of the lock groove is about 2.8 for the deep lock groove thread form and about 3.6<br>
for the hybrid lock groove thread form. A suitable range of the typical ratio of the<br>
pitch length to the depth of the lock groove would likely be about 2.5 to 4.0 or any<br>
other range falling within that range. The prior art wave form lock groove had a<br>
typical ratio of the pitch length to the depth of the lock grooves of about 4.8.<br>
Figures 7, 8 and 9 show still further mechanisms for lowering swage loads<br>
and. thus increasing installation tool life, in accordance with the invention. Like the<br>
hybrid thread form 26d and as-headed collar 14 previously discussed, the<br>
following low swage load mechanisms can also be employed independently or in<br>
any suitable combination with one or both of the aforementioned hybrid thread<br>
form 26d (Figure 6C) and as-hea'ded collar 14 (Figures 1-3, 5, 6A, 6B and 6C).<br>
Figure 7 shows a fastener 10d and installation tool 400 for securing two<br>
workpieces 18d, 20d together wherein the fastener has a pull mechanism 177<br>
comprising a substantially straight, relatively short pull portion 179 at the second<br>
end 19 of the pin 12d. Additionally, four sequential steps are shown for installing<br>
the fastener 10d using the exemplary low swage load system 50 in accordance<br>
with a method of the invention.<br>
The pull section 179 of the pin 12d has a relatively short length 183 and<br>
thus extends or protrudes from the second end 19 of the pin 12d a short distance.<br>
In fact, the protrusion length 183 of the exemplary pull section is so short that,<br>
unlike the acorn-shaped pull section of U.S. Patent No. 4,299,519 (see, e.g.,<br>
Figures 1-5) which has been incorporated by reference herein, the pull section 179<br>
of the invention is not intended to be severed following installation, although<br>
severance of the pull section 179 is conceivable by using a breakneck groove on<br>
the pin 12d or shaving off the pull section 179 with a sharing tool in other<br>
embodiments of the invention (not shown). This advantageously eliminates shock<br>
loading of the installation tooling 400 known to be caused by the sudden fracture<br>
of a break neck groove (see, e.g., break neck groove 40 of. Figure 1). It also<br>
eliminates pintail debris, and pinbreak noise. The preferred embodiment of the<br>
acorn-shaped pull portion of the '519 patent suffers from these disadvantages.<br>
More specifically, by way of example, for a 5/8 inch Grade 8 fastener 10d, the<br>
exemplary pull section 179 protrudes about 0.10 inches or less than the acorn-<br>
shaped pull section of the '519 patent. Also unlike the acorn-shaped pull section<br>
of the '519 patent, the exemplary pull section 179 extends substantially straight<br>
with all of the pull grooves 181 having substantially the same diameter DB, which is<br>
smaller than the outer diameter Da of the locking portion 25d of the pin 12d, as<br>
shown. As will be discussed, the straight, reduced diameter DB configuration of<br>
the exemplary pull portion 179 promotes better engagement by the installation tool<br>
400 and extended tool life. It is also significantly easier to manufacture than, for<br>
example, the tapered acorn-shaped configuration of the '519 patent, wherein each<br>
groove of the pull portion of the pull portion has a different diameter.<br>
Other improvements of the fastening system 50 of the invention are also<br>
shown in Figures 7, 8 and 9. Specifically, the exemplary installation tool 400 for<br>
installing fastener 10d includes a collet 402 having a pull section 404 with a<br>
plurality of teeth 408 structured to complimentarily engage the grooves 181 of the<br>
pull portion 179 of the pin (e.g., pin 12d), and an anvil member 410 having a<br>
swage cavity 412 for swaging the collar 14, as previously discussed. The reduced<br>
diameter DB but generally straight configuration of the exemplary pull portion 179<br>
allows the cross-sectional thickness T (Figures 7 and 8) of the collet 402 (Figures<br>
7 and 8) to be increased. Specifically, the thickness T can be increased up to the<br>
full amount of the difference in diameters Da' and DB of the pin lock portion 25c<br>
and pull portion 179, respectively. This makes the installation tool 400 stronger,<br>
thus giving it a longer fatigue life. The exemplary reduced diameter pull portion<br>
179 also results in less material being required for the manufacture of the pull<br>
portion 179 as compared, for example, with pull and locking portion 25a of<br>
fastener 10a of Figure 2. This in turn allows for the pull grooves 181 of the<br>
exemplary pin pull section 179, and the corresponding teeth 408 of the installation<br>
tool pull section 404 to have a greater thickness, thereby reducing stripping and<br>
galling of the pull grooves 181. Stripping and galling of the pull threads are a<br>
longstanding known disadvantage in the art. The first few threads of the tapered<br>
acorn design of the '519 patent may be susceptible to stripping and galling as<br>
wherein those threads have a reduced diameter, and. thus reduced strength and<br>
resistance to stripping.<br>
As noted, Figure 7 also shows the general method of installation using the<br>
exemplary low swage load fastening system 50 of the invention. Specifically, as<br>
shown, in operation, once the pin 12d is inserted through aligned openings 16d,<br>
17d in workpieces 18d, 20d, the collar 14 is applied over the second end 19 of the<br>
pin 12d. As previously discussed the collar may, but need not necessarily be the<br>
aforementioned exemplary as-headed collar 14. The pull portion 179 of the pin<br>
12d is then engaged by collet 402 of the installation tool 400. The exemplary<br>
collet is a split gripper collet 402 which expands to an open position (Figure 7, top<br>
illustration) and contracts to a constricted or closed position (Figure 7, second<br>
illustration from the top) wherein the teeth 408 of the collet pull section 404<br>
complimentarily substantially fully engage the pull grooves 181 of the pull portion<br>
179. The installation tool 400 is then actuated thereby drawing the collet 402 into<br>
the swage anvil 410, and closing the pull section 404 of the collet 402, in order that<br>
the collet 402 pulls the pin 12d and collar 14 into the swage cavity 412 of the anvil<br>
410 thereby applying a radially inward swage load, and swaging the collar 14 into<br>
the pin lock grooves 26d. The sensing rod 406 then detects when the swaging<br>
operation is complete by sensing when the pin 12d has been completely pulled,<br>
and accordingly deactivates the installation tool 400 withdrawing the collet 402,<br>
releasing the pull section 179, and ejecting the collar 14 from the anvil 410.<br>
Accordingly, the exemplary installation system 50 and method greatly improve and<br>
simplify fastener installation by achieving all of the advantages of a pintail-less<br>
installation while avoiding associated disadvantages like the required higher wear<br>
spin on thimble, which is replaced by the long wear collet 402. This also<br>
eliminates a plurality of other separate installation tool components such as a<br>
separate collet, release ejector, separate jaws, and follower and spring, and<br>
replaces them with essentially one part, the exemplary split gripper collet 402. In<br>
this manner the invention reduces the installation cycle time, cost, and complexity<br>
of know spin on engagements and provides tooling which is faster, lighter, quieter,<br>
and which contains less moving parts, equating to a significant cost savings.<br>
It will be appreciated that other installation methods and configurations<br>
other than those shown and described herein, could be employed. For example,<br>
as previously discussed, it is conceivable that a severable pin pull section (not<br>
shown) or an inner drive pull mechanism configuration (not shown) could be<br>
employed without departing from the scope of the invention. It will also be<br>
appreciated that while the pull section 179 is shown as having annual pull grooves<br>
181, other thread forms (e.g., without limitation, helical threads) could conceivably<br>
be employed if corresponding modifications were also made to the installation tool.<br>
The improvements of the exemplary installation tool 400 afforded by the<br>
exemplary pin pull portion configuration are further appreciated with reference to<br>
Figures 8 and 9.<br>
Figure 8 shows part of the pull section 404 of the exemplary split gripper<br>
collet 402 for installation tool 400. The pull section 404 has an engagement end<br>
405 (oriented to the left in Figure 8) and a plurality of teeth 408. In the example of<br>
Figure 8, the pull section 404 has four teeth 408. The first tooth 409, which is<br>
adjacent the engagement end 405 has a first inner diameter ID1 The remainder of<br>
the teeth 408 have a second inner diameter ID2, which is less than ID1.<br>
By opening up the inner diameter, ID1, of the first pulling tooth 409, as shown, the<br>
collet design of the invention resists chipping of that tooth 409.<br>
Specifically, the vertex (shown in phantom line drawing in Figure 8) of the<br>
exemplary first tooth 409 is removed to open up the inner diameter, ID1, at that<br>
location. This in turn moves the primary point of loading from this location to one<br>
that is further back within the pull section 404, (e.g., to the right with respect to<br>
Figure 8), thereby reducing the moment loading on the furthest forward root radius<br>
r of tooth 409 and thus increasing fatigue life of the collet 402. More specifically,<br>
by way of example with reference to the first tooth height h in the example of<br>
Figure 8, a reduction in tooth height of about 30% results in a dramatic increase in<br>
tool 400 fatigue life to about 24,000 installation cycles at about 12,000 pounds<br>
swage pressure for a Grade 5 fastener, having the exemplary pull section I79<br>
(Figure 7 ), whereas the front tooth 409 previously failed at 14,000 cycles. This<br>
dramatic improvement resulted, as previously discussed, from reducing the<br>
movement arm on the front tooth 409 by increasing the 1D1, which shifted the<br>
failure mode back to a more robust area (e.g., the fourth tooth 408 from the left) of<br>
the pull section 404 of the collet 402. This improvement is in addition to the<br>
aforementioned increase in tool life afforded by the greater wall thickness T of the<br>
collet 402. Additionally, as previously discussed, all of this is achieved through<br>
use of the exemplary single component split gripper collet 402, which is adapted to<br>
expand and constrict without requiring separate jaws, a separate ejector, or a<br>
separate follower and spring. This is because the exemplary split gripper collet<br>
402 includes one or more slits (not shown) which make it constrictable from a<br>
relaxed or open position (top illustration of Figure 7) to a closed or constricted<br>
position (second illustration of Figure 7) by being drawn into the inner bore 420<br>
(Figure e)) of the anvil 410 which exerts a radially inward force in order to close<br>
the collet pull section 404. It will, however, be appreciated that any known or<br>
suitable alternative collet design (not shown) having, for example, without<br>
limitation separate closeable jaws (not shown) could be employed to, for example,<br>
engage and pull the pin pull portion 179 (Figure 7).<br>
Figure 9 shows yet another advancement of the exemplary low swage load<br>
fastening system 50.<br>
Specifically, the exemplary swage anvil 410 includes the swage cavity 412,<br>
which, as shown, has a radiused entrance section 414 in order to facilitate initial<br>
engagement with the collar 14 (Figure 7), a swage land 416, and an inner bore<br>
420. The swage land 416 has a first diameter D1, and the inner bore 420 has a<br>
second diameter D2, which is greater than the first diameter D1. Accordingly, the<br>
inner bore diameter D2, which opens up behind the swage land 416, relieves<br>
compressive swage load on the collar 14 (Figure 7). This is made possible by the<br>
relatively narrow (i.e., small) nature of the exemplary swage land 416 (best shown<br>
in the sectional close-up view of Figure 9). The narrow width 418 of the swage<br>
land defines a small swaging area because it then opens into the larger diameter<br>
D2 inner bore 120, as opposed to having a continuous single diameter for<br>
substantially the entire length L. of the swage anvil 410. The increased diameter,<br>
D2, of the inner bore 420 of the exemplary anvil 410 also provides space to<br>
accommodate the thicker and thus stronger wall thickness T of the collet 402<br>
(Figures 7 and 8), thereby further increasing tool life. Furthermore, the length L, of<br>
the improved anvil 410 of the invention, may also be shortened, as compared, for<br>
example, to anvil 110 of Figure 1. Accordingly, the low swage load fastening<br>
system 50 of the invention also provides a number of installation tool 400<br>
improvements by reducing the number parts for the tool, decreasing the weight of<br>
the tool, reducing swage loads required by the tool, reducing the cost to make the<br>
tool, and increasing the expected life time of the tool.<br>
With reference particularly to Figures 6A, 6B and 6C, the details of the<br>
interaction of the collar and bolt are shown. When the collar first tries to the pull<br>
the bolt in preload, the collar is not strong enough, so the first bolt crest shears the<br>
collar, creating a void and rolling up collar material in front of the bolt crest. The<br>
same thing happens to a lesser extent on the second bolt crest. Finally, there is<br>
enough collar material engaged onto the bolt so voids and roll-up do not occur.<br>
This happens sooner with as-headed collars that are harder than<br>
quench/tempered collars because they have higher shear strength. Harder collars<br>
stretch the bolt sooner and create more preload.<br>
Figure 10 is a cross-sectional view of an improved fastener pin pull portion<br>
and installation tool configuration in accordance with an embodiment of the<br>
invention and four sequential installation steps for swaging the fastener collar<br>
employing the improved pin pull portion using a different collet. The system there<br>
shown is similar to Figure 7. In Figure 11, which is similar to Figure 8 there is a<br>
cross-sectional view of an end portion of the different collet for the installation tool<br>
of Figure 10.<br>
In the disclosure of Figures 10 and 11 there is a low swage load fastening<br>
system for a swage-type fastener structured to secure a plurality of workpieces<br>
together.   The swage-type fastener includes a pin member having an elongated<br>
pin shank adapted to be located in aligned openings in the workpieces. The pin<br>
member terminates at one end in an enlarged head adapted to engage a surface<br>
on one side of the workpieces and at its opposite end in a grooved portion adapted<br>
to extend past an opposite surface on the opposite side of the workpieces.<br>
The grooved portion comprises a locking portion having a plurality of lock<br>
grooves defined by circumferentially extending pin grooves and associated pin<br>
shoulders terminating in pin crests.<br>
An installation tool includes an anvil member 410 with a swage cavity.<br>
There is an as-headed collar 14 including a generally straight collar shank adapted<br>
to be swaged into said lock grooves on the pin member in response to a relative<br>
axial force or swage load applied between the pin member and the as-headed<br>
collar by the installation tool.<br>
A desired magnitude of clamp load on the workpieces which are fastened<br>
together define a fastened joint. The swage cavity of said installation tool is<br>
structured to engage said collar shank and to swage it radially inward. The as-<br>
headed collar when swaged, has collar grooves and shoulders interlocking said<br>
pin grooves and shoulders. The pin member and said as-headed collar is of<br>
different materials having ultimate shear stresses of different magnitudes in order<br>
that yielding of said pin member is substantially avoided upon swaging said collar<br>
to said pin member.<br>
The collet 600 has a protrusion 602 from said collet thereby extending the<br>
length 604 of the pull section in a direction towards the collar 14 thereby to<br>
increase the contact area with the anvil 410. Extending puller length increases<br>
contact area with anvil which decreases pressure and galling. It also allows for<br>
lead angle as puller returns through smaller anvil bore.<br>
The as-headed collar idoes not requjre thermal processing, and the<br>
generally straight collar shank of the as-headed collar has a wall thickness which<br>
is relatively thin thereby reducing the swage load required to the as-headed collar.<br>
The protrusion 600 forms a flat circular face 600 ahead of and adjacent to<br>
the leading thread 608 of the collet 600. Then there is a circular forwardly angled<br>
face 610 ahead of the flat face 606. There is a second flat face 612, and an<br>
angular flat face 614 back to a line of intersection 616 with the outer diameter of<br>
the collet 600. The shear strength of the last bolt crest is increased by not rolling<br>
down the headed blank diameter at the end of the bolt.<br>
The end 618 of the pull 620 is not rolled down to a diameter position in line<br>
with the base 622 of the groove 624. This increases the shear strength of the end<br>
pull crest 626 of the pull 620. The puller teeth shears bolt threads off at line 636.<br>
The last pull crest 626 of the pull has a contour 628 to conform with an<br>
enlarged puller radius 630 of the last tooth 620 of the collet 600.<br>
Also, the shortened first puller tooth 632 increasing its thickness 634 thus<br>
reduces chipping.<br>
In view of the foregoing, the invention provides a low swage load fastening<br>
system and method with numerous improved fastener and installation tool<br>
features, including an as-headed collar, a hybrid lock groove thread farm, an<br>
improved pin pull section, and a variety of installation tool improvements, all of<br>
which independently, and in any suitable combination, lower swage loads and<br>
improve the installation of swage-type fasteners.<br>
While specific embodiments of the invention have been described in detail,<br>
it will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that various modifications and<br>
alternatives to those details could be developed in light of the overall teachings of<br>
the disclosure.  Accordingly, the particular arrangements disclosed are meant to<br>
be illustrative only and not limiting as to the scope of invention which is to be given<br>
the full breadth of the claims appended and any and all equivalents thereof.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
