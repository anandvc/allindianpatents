				<td>[001] This application claims priority under 35 U.S.C. § 119(e)<br>
to U.S. Serial No. 60/552,480 filed on 12 March 2004, the entire<br>
contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[002] This invention relates to processes for preparing caspase<br>
inhibitors and intermediates derivatives thereof.<br>
BACKGOUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[003] Caspases are a family of cysteine protease enzymes that are<br>
key mediators in the signaling pathways for apoptosis and cell<br>
disassembly (Thornberry, Chem. Biol., 1998, 5, R97-R103).<br>
Apoptosis, or programmed cell death, is a principal mechanism by<br>
which organisms eliminate unwanted cells. The deregulation of<br>
apoptosis, either excessive apoptosis or the failure to undergo<br>
it, has been implicated in a number of diseases such as cancer,<br>
acute inflammatory and autoimmune disorders, and certain<br>
neurodegenerative disorders (see generally Science, 1998, 281,<br>
1283-1312; Ellis et al., Ann. Rev. Cell. Biol., 1991, 7, 663).<br>
Caspase-1, the first identified caspase, is also known as<br>
interleukin-1β converting enzyme or "ICE." Caspase-1 converts<br>
precursor interleukin-1β ("pIL-1β) to the pro-inflammatory<br>
active form by specific cleavage of pIL-1β between Asp-116 and<br>
Ala-117. Besides caspase-1 there are also eleven other known<br>
human caspases which have been classified into families based on<br>
their biological function.<br>
[004] Many currently reported synthetic routes for producing<br>
caspase inhibitors require expensive starting materials,<br>
chromatographic separation of diastereomers, and/or<br>
disadvantageous synthetic steps.<br><br>
[005] It would be desirable to have a synthetic route to caspase<br>
inhibitors, or prodrugs thereof, that is amenable to large-scale<br>
synthesis and overcomes the aforementioned shortcomings or<br>
otherwise improves upon the current methods.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[006] The processes and compounds described herein are useful for<br>
producing modified aspartic acid derivatives, such as aspartic<br>
acid aldehyde moieties. Aspartic acid derivatives are useful<br>
for preparing caspase inhibitors and/or prodrugs thereof.<br>
[007] In one aspect, the invention features a process for<br>
preparing a compound of formula GIA or GIB:<br><br>
comprising the steps of:<br>
(a) reacting a compound of formula GIIA or GIIB:<br><br>
and a compound of formula GIII:<br><br>
in the presence of a palladium catalyst, a palladium ligand, and<br>
a base in a solvent optionally including a phase transfer<br>
catalyst and optionally including water;<br>
wherein:<br><br>
X is a leaving group;<br>
Ra is H, an optionally substituted alkyl, an optionally<br>
substituted aryl, -CN, -C(O)-Oalkyl or halogen;<br>
R3 is an organic moiety;<br>
R2 is an optionally substituted alkyl, heterocyclic,<br>
alkylaryl, or aryl; and<br>
R4 is an optionally substituted aliphatic, a heterocyclic,<br>
or an aromatic; or<br>
R2 and R4 together with the groups to which they are bound,<br>
form a 5- to 8-membered heterocyclic ring which is optionally<br>
substituted. Embodiments of this aspect may include using a<br>
phase transfer catalyst.<br>
[008] Other aspects of the invention are set forth herein.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
I . DEFINITIONS<br>
[009] As used herein, the base used in connection with palladium<br>
catalyst and palladium ligand refers to an "inorganic base" or<br>
an "organic base".<br>
[010] As used herein, "inorganic bases" that may be used in a<br>
process of this invention include, but are not limited to a<br>
carbonate salt, a bicarbonate salt, and/or a phosphate salt (and<br>
mixtures thereof) . In some embodiments of this invention, the<br>
inorganic base may be a carbonate salt having the formula MCO3,<br>
wherein M is an appropriate counter-cation. Examples of<br>
carbonate salts include, but are not limited to, K2CO3, K2P04,<br>
Na2CO3/ Li2CO3, Rb2CO3, and Cs2CO3. In some specific embodiments,<br>
the inorganic base is K2CO3 or Cs2CO3.<br>
[011] As used herein, "organic bases" that may be used in a<br>
process of this invention include tertiary organic bases that<br>
include, but are not limited to trialkylamines, e.g.<br>
diethylisopropylamine, triethylamine, N-methylmorpholine and the<br><br>
like, and heteroaryl amines, e.g. pyridine, quinoline, and the<br>
like.<br>
[012] As used herein, "Palladium catalysts" that may be used in a<br>
process of this invention include, but are not limited to,<br>
Palladium II Salts such as Pd(OAc)2 and Pd2dba3.<br>
[013] As used herein, "Palladium ligand" and "Palladium II<br>
ligand" refers to a ligand that is capable of forming a complex<br>
with the palladium catalyst. Palladium ligands include, but are<br>
not limited to, phosphine, bisphosphine, XantPhos,<br>
bis (diphenylphosphino) ferrocene and DPEPhos (see Aldrich<br>
catalog). See also, WO 95/30680 and US 5,817,848.<br>
[014] "Solvents" for use in this invention include, but are not<br>
limited to, toluene, dioxane, and THF, and mixtures thereof.<br>
[015] The term "leaving group" refers to a moiety which is<br>
replaced by R3CONH2. Specific groups include, but are not<br>
limited to, chloro, bromo, iodo, pseudohalogens, triflate,<br>

[016] The term "organic moiety" as used in defining variable R3<br>
refers to any chemical moiety provided that the moiety does not<br>
contain a moiety that would interfere with the palladium<br>
catalysts. Such interfering moieties would be well known to<br>
skilled practitioners and include, e.g., a free sulfhydryl<br>
group. A group such as a sulfide or a thiol should not<br>
therefore be present in the R3 organic moiety. Furthermore, the<br>
R3 organic moiety should not contain an amine group, such as a<br>
primary or secondary amine that would be more reactive than the<br>
amide of formula (GIIA or GIIB) . R3 may contain primary and<br>
secondary amines that are capped with protecting groups that<br>
reduce the interaction between the protected amine and the<br>
palladium catalysts.<br>
[017] As used herein, the term "phase transfer catalyst" means a<br>
compound which is capable of transfering a water soluble anion<br><br>
into an organic phase. Phase transfer catalysts include<br>
tetralkylammonium salts, phosphonium salts and crown ethers.<br>
Examples of phase transfer catalysts include, but are not<br>
limited to tetrasubstituted ammonium salts and trisubstituted<br>
amines which may form tetrasubstituted ammonium salts in situ.<br>
Tetrasubstituted ammonium salts include, but are not limited to,<br>
tetrabutylammonium, benzyltrimethylammonium, tetraethylamtnonium,<br>
cetyltrimethylammonium salts in which the counter ion can Doe<br>
salts bromide, chloride, or iodide. In some examples, the phase<br>
transfer catalyst is cetyltrimethylammonium bromide.<br>
Trisubstituted amines include, but are not limited to<br>
triethylamine, tributylamine,benzyldiethylamine, and<br>
diisopropylethylamine.<br>
[018] As used herein, the terms "lactone" and "furanone" may be<br>
used interchangeably as will be understood by one skilled in the<br>
art.<br>
[019] As used herein, the term "aliphatic" means straight<br>
chained, branched or cyclic C1-C12 hydrocarbons which are<br>
completely saturated or which contain one or more units of<br>
unsaturation. For example, suitable aliphatic groups include<br>
substituted or unsubstituted linear, branched or cyclic alkyl,<br>
alkenyl, alkynyl groups and hybrids thereof such as.<br>
(cycloalkyl) alkyl, (cycloalkenyl)alkyl or (cycloalkyl)alkenyl.<br>
[020] The term "alkyl" and "alkoxy" used alone or as part of a<br>
larger moiety refers to both straight and branched chains<br>
containing one to twelve carbon atoms. The terms "alkenyl" and<br>
"alkynyl" used alone or as part of a larger moiety shall include<br>
both straight and branched chains containing two to twelve<br>
carbon atoms.<br>
[021] As used herein, the term "aryl", used alone or as part of a<br>
larger moiety as in "aralkyl", refers to aromatic ring groups<br>
having five to fourteen members, such as phenyl, benzyl, 1-<br><br>
naphthyl, 2-naphthyl, 1-anthracyl and 2-anthracyl, and<br>
heterocyclic aromatic groups or heteroaryl groups such as 2-<br>
furanyl, 3-furanyl, N-imidazolyl, 2-imidazolyl, 4-imidazolyl,<br>
5-imidazolyl, 3-isoxazolyl, 4-isoxazolyl, 5-isoxazolyl, a 1,3,4-<br>
oxadiazolyl, a 1,2,4-oxadiazolyl, 2-oxadiazolyl, 5-oxadiazolyl,<br>
2-oxazolyl, 4-oxazolyl, 5-oxazolyl, 2-pyrrolyl, 3-pyrrolyl, 2-<br>
pyridyl, 3-pyridyl, 4-pyridyl, 2-pyrimidyl, 4-pyrimidyl, 5-<br>
pyrimidyl, 3-pyridazinyl, 2-thiadiazolyl, 5-thiadiazolyl,<br>
2-thiazolyl, 4-thiazolyl, 5-thiazolyl, 5-tetrazolyl,<br>
2-triazolyl, 5-triazolyl, 2-thienyl, or 3-thienyl. The term<br>
"aryl ring" also refers to rings that are optionally<br>
substituted. Aryl groups also include fused polycyclic aromatic<br>
ring systems in which a carbocyclic aromatic ring or heteroaryl<br>
ring is fused to one or more other rings. Examples include<br>
tetrahydronaphthyl, benzimidazolyl, benzothienyl, benzofuranyl,<br>
indolyl, quinolinyl, benzothiazolyl, benzooxazolyl,<br>
benzimidazolyl, isoquinolinyl, isoindolyl, acridinyl,<br>

of the term "aryl", as it is used herein, is a group in which,<br>
one or more carbocyclic aromatic rings and/or heteroaryl rings<br>
are fused to a cycloalkyl or non-aromatic heterocyclic ring, for<br>
example, indanyl or tetrahydrobenzopyranyl. The term "aromatic<br>
ring" or "aromatic group" refers to aryl groups.<br>
[022] The term "heterocyclic" refers to saturated and partially<br>
unsaturated monocyclic or polycyclic ring systems containing one<br>
or more heteroatoms and a ring size of three to eight such as<br>
piperidinyl, piperazinyl, tetrahydrofuranyl, pyrrolidinyl,<br>
tetrahydropyranyl, morpholinyl, and the like.<br>
[023] As used herein, the term "bicyclic fused ring system" or<br>
"bicyclic ring system" refers to two rings which share two<br>
atoms. Either ring may be saturated, partially unsaturated, or<br>
aromatic. Each ring also may contain 1 to 3 heteroatoms.<br><br>
Examples of bicyclic fused ring systems include, but are not<br>
limited to, compounds g, j, k, 1, and m shown in Table 1, and<br>
compounds g-1 and j-1, 1-1/ 1-2, k-1, m-1 and m-2 shown in Table<br>
2 .<br>
[024] As used herein, the term "tricyclic fused ring system" or<br>
"tricyclic ring system" refers to a bicyclic ring system in<br>
which a third ring is fused to the bicyclic ring system such<br>
that the third ring shares at least two atoms with the bicyclic<br>
ring system. In some embodiments, all three rings share at<br>
least one common atom. Any of the rings in the tricyclic ring<br>
system may be saturated, partically unsaturated, or aromatic.<br>
Each of the rings may include 1 to 3 heteroatoms. Examples of<br>
tricyclic ring systems include, but are not limited to,<br>
compounds e and q shown in Table 1, and compounds e-1 and q-1<br>
shown in Table 2.<br>
[025] As used herein,the phrase "optionally substituted"<br>
followed by a chemical moiety (e.g., an optionally substituted<br>
aliphatic) means that the chemical moiety may be substituted<br>
with one or more (e.g., 1-4) substituents. In some embodiments,<br>
aliphatic groups, alkyl groups, aryl groups, heterocyclic<br>
groups, carbocyclic groups, and bicyclic or tricyclic ring<br>
systems contain one or more substituents. The substituents are<br>
selected from those that will be stable under the reaction<br>
conditions of the present process, as would be generally known<br>
to those skilled in the art. Examples of substituents include<br>
halogen, -Q1, -OQ1, -OH, protected OH (such as acyloxy), phenyl<br>
(Ph) , substituted Ph, -OPh, substituted -OPh, -NO2, -CN, -NHQ1,<br>
-N(Q1)2, -NHCOQ1, -NHCONHQ1, -NQ1CONHQ1# -NHCON(Q1)2, -NQ1CON (Q1)2,<br>
-NQ1COQ1, -NHCOaQ1, -NQ1CO2Q1, -CO2Q1, -COQ1, -CONHQ1, -CON(Q1)2,<br>
-S(O)2Q1, -SONH2, -S(O)Q1, -SO2NHQ1, -SOzN(Q1)2, -NHS(O)2Q1,<br>
-NQ1S(O)2Q1, =0, =S, =NNHQ1, =NN(Q1)2, =N-OQ1, =NNHCOQ1, =NNQ1COQ1,<br>
=NNHCO2Q1, =NNQ1CO2Q1, =NNHSO2Q1, =NNQ1SO2Q1, or =NQ1 where Q1 is an<br><br>
aliphatic, aryl or aralkyl group, and each of Q1, the<br>
substituted phenyl and the substituted -OPh may be substituted<br>
with 1 to 4 of halogen, -Q3, -0Q3, -OH, protected OH (such as<br>
acyloxy) , phenyl (Ph) , -OPh, -NO2, -CN, -NHQ3, -N(Q3)2, -NHCOQ3,<br>
-NHCONHQ3/ -NQ3CONHQ3, -NHCON(Q3)2, -NQ3CON (Q3) 2, -NQ3COQ3,<br>
-NHCO2Q3, -NQ3CO2Q3, -CO2Q3, -COQ3, -CONHQ3 , -CON(Q3)2, -S(O)2Q3,<br>
-SONH2, -S(O)Q3, -SO2NHQ3, -SO2N(Q3)2, -NHS(O)2Q3, -NQ1S(O)2Q3, =0,<br>
= S, =NNHQ3, =NN(Q3)2, =N-0Q3, =NNHCOQ3, =NTNQ3COQ3, =NNHCO2Q3,<br>
=NNQ3CO2Q3, =NNHSO2Q3, =NNQ3SO2Q3; or =NQ3 where Q3 is aliphatic or<br>
aryl.<br>
[026] As used herein, nitrogen atoms on a heterocyclic ring may<br>
be optionally substituted. Suitable substituents on the<br>
nitrogen atom include Q2, COQ2, S(O)2Q2, and CO2Q2, where Q2 is an<br>
aliphatic group or a substituted aliphatic group.<br>
[027] Unless otherwise stated, structures depicted herein are<br>
also meant to include all stereochemical forms of the structure;<br>
i.e., the R and S configurations for each asymmetric center.<br>
Therefore, single stereochemical isomers as well as enantiomeric<br>
and diastereomeric mixtures of the present compounds are within<br>
the scope of the invention.<br>
[028] The term "substantially pure" refers to the stereochemical<br>
purity of a compound that is greater than 90%. In some<br>
embodiments, the stereochemical purity of a compound is greater<br>
than 95%. And in still others, the stereochemical purity of a<br>
compound is 99% or greater.<br>
[029] The term "selective crystallization" means crystallization<br>
of a substantially pure isomer from a solvent containing a<br>
mixture of isomers.<br>
[030] The term "dynamic crystallization" means crystallization of<br>
a substantially pure isomer from a solvent containing a mixture<br>
of isomers under conditions which cause isomerization of the<br>
mixture of isomers to an isomer which selectively crystallizes.<br><br>
For example, in the case of resolving enantiomers, isomerization<br>
of the more soluble enantiomer to the less soluble isomer<br>
results in crystallization of the less soluble isomer as the<br>
equilibrium between the isomers is driven by crystallization<br>
toward the less soluble enantiomer. A specific example of<br>
dynamic crystallization may include the epimerization of an<br>
anomeric carbon in a solvent under conditions which selectively<br>
crystallizes one substantially pure enantiomer.<br>
[031] Unless otherwise stated, structures depicted herein are<br>
also meant to include compounds which differ only in the<br>
presence of one or more isotopically enriched atoms. For<br>
example, compounds having the present structures except for the<br>
replacement of a hydrogen by a deuterium or tritium, or the<br>
replacement of a carbon by a 13C- or 14C-enriched carbon are<br>
within the scope of this invention.<br>
[032] Various "protecting groups," "capping groups," or "amine<br>
capping groups" may be used in the methods of this invention<br>
(see, e.g., T.W. Greene &amp; P.G.M. Wutz, "Protective Groups in<br>
Organic Synthesis," 3rd Edition, John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. (1999)<br>
and the earlier and later editions of this book). Examples of<br>
amine capping groups or protecting groups include, but are not<br>
limited to, -R7, -C(O)R7, -C(O)OR7, -SOR7, -SO2R7, -SO3R7,<br>

-P(O) (R7)2, and -P(O) (OR7)2; wherein R7 is hydrogen, an optionally<br>
substituted aliphatic group, an optionally substituted aryl<br>
group, or an optionally substituted heterocyclic group.<br>
Preferably, R7 is (C1-C12)-aliphatic-, (C3-C10)-cycloaliphatic -,<br>
(C3-C10)-cycloaliphatic]-(C1-C12)-aliphatic-, (C6-C10)-aryl-,<br>
(C6-C10)-aryl-(C1-C12)aliphatic-, (C3-C10)-heterocyclyl-, (C6-<br>
C10)-heterocyclyl- (C1-C12)aliphatic-, (C5-C10)-heteroaryl-, or<br>
(C5-C10)-heteroaryl-(C1-C12)-aliphatic-.<br><br>
[033] As used herein, the term "lewis acid" refers to moiety<br>
capable of sharing or accepting an electron pair. Examples of<br>
lewis acids include, but are not limited to, BF3-etherates and<br>
metal halides, alkoxides, and mixed halide/alkoxides (e.g.,<br>
Al (Oalkyl) 2C1, Al (Oalkyl) Cl2) . The metals can be aluminum,<br>
titanium, zirconium, magnesium, copper, zinc, iron, tin, boron,<br>
ytterbium, lanthanum, and samarium.<br>
[034] EDC is 1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-3-ethylcarbodiimide. HOBt<br>
is 1-hydroxybenzotriazole. THF is tetrahydrofuran. TFA is<br>
trifluoroacetic acid. DCM is dichloromethane. DMAP is 4-<br>
dimethylaminopyridine. DIPEA is diisopropylethylamine. DMF is<br>
dimethylformamide. TFA is trifluoroacetic acid. CBZ is<br>
benzyloxycarbonyl. 1H NMR is nuclear magnetic resonance. TLC is<br>

II. PROCESSES<br>
[035] Processes and compounds described herein are useful for<br>
producing caspase inhibitors and/or prodrugs thereof that<br>
contain modified aspartic acid derivatives, such as aspartic<br>
acid aldehyde moieties. An aspartic acid aldehyde moiety exists<br>
in equilibrium with its cyclic hemiacetal form as shown below:<br><br>
where W2 represents the rest of the caspase inhibitor molecule.<br>
Orally available prodrugs of caspase inhibitors have been<br>
developed based on the cyclic hemiacetal. For example, the ICE<br>
inhibitor 2 including the cyclic hemiacetal is a prodrug being<br>
developed as a treatment for rheumatoid arthritis (see US Patent<br>
5,716,929)<br><br><br>
[036] The general synthetic procedure shown in Scheme 1 is useful<br>
for generating a wide array of chemical species which can be<br>
used in the manufacture of pharmaceutical compounds.<br><br>
The process shown in Scheme 1 includes reacting a compound of<br>
formula GII with the amide GIII in the presence of a palladium<br>
catalyst, a palladium ligand and a base in a solvent optionally<br>
including a phase transfer catalyst and optionally including<br>
water to produce the amido carbonyl compound GI.<br>
[037] The moietys X, Ra, R2, R3 and R4 are defined above. As<br>
drawn, GII refers to compounds in which X may be cis or trans to<br>
Ra, which provides for both the cis and trans compounds of GI,<br>
e.g., R2 can be cis or trans to Ra.<br>
[038] In some embodiments, the process may be used to prepare a<br>
compound of formula XIV, when the moietys R2 and R4 shown in<br>
Scheme I form a substituted heterocyclic ring:<br><br><br>
wherein R3 and Ra are defined above and R5 is an optionally-<br>
substituted aliphatic, optionally substituted aralkyl,<br>
optionally substituted heterocyclylalkyl or optionally<br>
substituted aryl. Specifically, compound XIV may be produced by<br>
reacting a compound of formula XV:<br><br>
and a compound of formula XIII:<br><br>
in the presence of a palladium catalyst, a palladium II ligand,<br>
a base, a solvent, and optionally a phase transfer catalyst;<br>
wherein X, R3, and R5 are defined above.<br>
[039] In carrying out the reaction shown in Scheme 1, the<br>
reactants and reagents may be used in any molar amount which<br>
provides the desired product. In some embodiments, the ratio of<br>
the molar amounts of palladium II salt to palladium ligand is<br>
between 1:1 to about 1:5. The ratio of the molar amounts of<br>
palladium II salt to the reactant GIII can be between about<br>
1:200 to about 1:1, about 1:100 to about 1:25, or about 1:50 to<br>
about 1:10. The ratio of the molar amount of the base relative<br>
to the GUI is between about 1:2 to about 10:1. The two<br>
reactants, GII and GIII, and the base can be used in nearly<br>
equal molar amounts. In some embodiments, the ratio of GII and<br>
GIII can be between about 1:3 to about 3:1.<br>
[040] The reaction in Scheme I may be conducted at a temperature<br>
between 25°C and 12 0°C, e.g., about 5 0°C, in any solvent that<br>
does not adversely interfere with the palladium catalyst, the<br><br>
palladium ligand, and the reactants. Examples of suitable<br>
solvents are described herein and can include toluene, dioxane,<br>
THF, and mixtures thereof. In some embodiments, the solvent may-<br>
include water.<br>
[041] After obtaining the compound XIV, the compound of formula<br>
XVI:<br><br>
may be obtained by reducing the furanone ring double bond.<br>
[042] The reduction of a furanone ring double bond may be<br>
accomplished with a hydride reducing agent, especially a<br>
borohydride. Examples of such borohydrides include sodium or<br>
lithium borohydride, sodium or lithium triacetoxyborohydride,<br>
sodium or lithium cyanoborohydride, tetrabutylammonium<br>
cyanoborohydride, sodium or lithium trialkylborohydride,<br>
preferably sodium cyanoborohydride. Typically the reaction<br>
mixture is adjusted to be mildly acidic, preferably at a pH<br>
between 3.0 and 6.0 with acids such as HCl, HBr, acetic acid,<br>
formic acid, trifluoroacetic acid, BF3.OEt2, aluminum<br>
trichloride, zinc chloride, or titanium tetrachloride.<br>
Optionally, the reaction may be buffered with 1.0-5.0<br>
equivalents of sodium acetate. Optionally, the reaction may be<br>
catalyzed by the addition of 1-5% CoCl2/semicorrin, ZnCl2, or 1-2<br>
equivalents of chlorotrimethylsilane. Chiral hydride reducing<br>
agents are known such as R- or S-Alpine Hydride® (lithium B-<br>
isopinocampheyl-9-borα-bicyclo[3.3.l]nonyl hydride) to provide<br>
asymmetric reduction.<br>
[043] Reduction of the ring double bond in, e.g., XIV may also be<br>
accomplished by hydrogenation. This is useful when R5 is stable<br>
to the hydrogenation conditions, such as when R5 is alkyl.<br><br>
Typical hydrogenation conditions include hydrogen gas at a<br>
pressure in the range of about one to 100 atmospheres, usually<br>
between about 1 to about 20, or about 1 to about 10 atmospheres,<br>
and a catalyst present in the range of about 0.01 to 0.5<br>
equivalents per equivalent of XIV (for example). Suitable<br>
catalysts include Pd/C, Pd(0H)2, PdO, Pt/C, PtO2, preferentially<br>
Pt/C or Pd/C. Suitable solvents include ethyl acetate,<br>
alcohols, such as methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, aromatic<br>
hydrocarbons, such as benzene, toluene, xylene, ethereal such as<br>
THF, DME, dioxane, preferentially ethanol or THF. When R5 is<br>
alkyl or aralkyl, such as benzyl, a rhodium (I) or ruthenium<br>
(II) catalyst is preferred for stereoselective reduction. Such<br>
catalyst is formed by reacting the metal as one of its various<br>
complexes with chiral forms of ligands such as methyl- or ethyl-<br>
DuPHOS (1,1-bis-2,5-dialkylphospholano)benzene, DIOP (2,3-O-<br>
isopropylidene-2 , 3-dihydroxy-l, 4-bis (diphenylphosphino) butane) ,<br>
BINAP (2,2'-bis(diphenylphosphino)-1,1'-binaphthyl) , CHIRAPHOS (<br>
bis(diphenylphosphino)butane), BPPM (N-t-butoxycarbonyl-2-<br>
(diphenylphosphino) methyl-4- (diphenylphosphino) pyrrolidine) ,<br>
BPPFA (N,N-dimethyl-l- [1',2-bis(diphenylphosphino)<br>
ferrocenyl]ethylamine), DEGPHOS (N-benzyl-3,4-<br>
bis(diphenylphosphino)pyrrolidine), or alkyl-BPE<br>
(bisphospholanoethane). Many other suitable ligands are known<br>
in the art. Preferred catalysts are 1,2-bis(2,5-dialkyl-<br>
phospholano) benzene (cyclooctadiene)rhodium(I)<br>
trifluoromethanesulfonate, where alkyl is a straight chain or<br>
branched alkyl group of 1-8 carbons, optionally substituted with<br>
an aromatic hydrocarbon such as phenyl.<br>
[044] Use of the (R,R) isomer of these ligands will lead to the<br>
(S)-configuration of the α-amino carbon in the product and use<br>
of the (S,S) isomer will lead to the (R)-configuration.<br>
Suitable solvents include ethyl acetate, alcohols, such as<br><br>
methanol, ethanol, or isopropanol, aromatic hydrocarbons, such<br>
as benzene, toluene, or xylene, ethers such as THF, DME, or<br>
dioxane. Preferred solvents are toluene or methanol. The<br>
reaction concentration of XIV will typically be in the range of<br>
about 0.01M to 1.0M, preferably about 0.1M to 1.0M. The<br>
reaction temperature is usually in the range of about 0° C to<br>
about 60° C, preferably between about 20° C to about 40° C. (For<br>

[045] In certain embodiments, when the moiety R3 includes a chiral<br>
carbon bound to the carbonyl of the amide, GUI has the<br>
stereochemistry shown in<br><br>
as for example in the structure GIV<br><br><br>
The reaction of GIV provides the compound of the formula<br><br>
The stereoisomers of GV may be purified by selective<br>
crystallization, dynamic crystallzation or chromatography.<br>
[046] As described herein, R3 is any organic moiety.<br>
Specifically, it will be understood that the R3 group may be<br>
selected from any organic moiety that is stable to conditions of<br>
the coupling reaction shown in Scheme I, such as those<br>
conditions described herein.<br>
[047] In specific embodiments, the general process shown in<br>
Scheme 1 is useful for producing caspase inhibitors, such as<br>
prodrugs of caspase inhibitors, e.g., ICE inhibitors, and<br>
intermediates thereof. In these embodiments, R3 is preferably<br>
any moiety that, taken as a whole with the rest of the molecule,<br>
provides such an inhibitor. Typically, for caspase inhibitors,<br>
the R3 moiety is specifically referred to in the art as a P2, P3,<br>
P4, or combination thereof, moiety or site. Examples of P2, P3,<br>
P4 moieties are described in more detail below.<br>
[048] The Px moiety terms refer to the amino acid sequence next to<br>
the aspartyl cleavage site of a particular caspase substrate. P1<br>
refers to the aspartyl residue of the substrate where caspase-<br>
induced cleavage occurs in the natural substrate. In the design<br>
of new, nonpeptidic caspase inhibitors, the Px designation is<br>
often retained to show which portion of the amino acid sequence<br>
has been replaced by the non-peptidic moiety. As used herein,<br>
the term "P2-P4" moiety refers to either the amino acid sequence<br>
described above or a chemical moiety known to replace such a<br><br>
sequence for the purpose of being a caspase substrate, and in<br>
particular an ICE substrate.<br>
[049] Examples of P2-P4 moieties that are non-peptidic are<br>
described in US 5,919,790 (Allen et al.); US 5,874,424<br>
(Batchelor et al.); US 5,847,135 (Bemis et al.); US 5,843,904<br>
(Bemis et al.); US 5,756,466 (Bemis et al.); US 5,716,929 (Bemis<br>
et al.) ; US 5, 656,627(Bemis et al.) ; WO 99/36426 (Warner-<br>
Lambert); Dolle et al., J. Med. Chem. , 40, 1941 (1997); WO<br>
98/10778 (Idun); WO 98/11109 (Idun); WO 98/11129 (Idun) and WO<br>
98/16502 (Warner Lambert), all of which are incorporated by-<br>
reference .<br>
[050] As would be recognized by skilled practitioners, a P moiety<br>
is not necessarily an amino acid residue. For example, a P4<br>
gr-oup could be referred to as an amino capping group (e.g.,<br>
ptienyl-C(O)-). Such P4 groups are exemplified herein.<br>
[051] In another embodiment, this invention provides a process<br>
for preparing a compound of formula XVI:<br><br>
wherein R3 is a P4-P3-P2 moiety of a caspase inhibitor, or portion<br>
thereof. Each P2, P3, and P4 group may be incorporated into XVI<br>
either individually or together. For example, if R3 is a group<br>
other than a P2 group (e.g., a protecting), the R3C=O group may<br>
be removed to provide a compound with a free amine group. That<br>
amine group and an appropriate P2 moiety may be coupled under,<br>
e.g., standard coupling conditions to provide a compound wherein<br>
R3 is a P2 moiety of a caspase inhibitor. A P3 and a P4 group may<br>
be added together or individually in a similar manner. For<br>
example, if the P2 moiety is protected, the protecting group may<br>
be removed and a P3 or a P4-P3- moiety (optionally protected) may<br><br>
be incorporated. If a capping group other than a typical<br>
protecting group is desired on any of the terminal P2, P3, or P4<br>
residues, such a group may be added routinely by methods known<br>
to skilled practitioners.<br>
[052] Accordingly, one embodiment provides a process wherein R3 is<br>
a P2- mciety of a caspase inhibitor.<br>
[053] Another embodiment provides a process wherein R3 is a P3-P2-<br>
moiety of a caspase inhibitor.<br>
[054] Yet another embodiment provides a process wherein R3 is a<br>
P4-P3-P2- moiety of a caspase inhibitor.<br>
[055] Another embodiment provides a process wherein R3 is a P4-P3-<br>
P2- moiety of a caspase inhibitor, and wherein said moiety is one<br>
of the groups listed in Table 1 below; or wherein said moiety is<br>
one of the groups listed in Table 2 below.<br>
[056] According to another embodiment, R3 is a P4-P3-P2- moiety<br>
wherein the P4 portion thereof is selected from R-CO, ROC=O,<br>
RNHC=O, RC(O)C=O or RSO2 and R is one of the groups listed in<br>
Table 3.<br>
[057] According to yet another embodiment, R3 is a P4-P3-P2- moiety<br>
selected from one of the groups listed in Table 4.<br>
[058] In any of the embodiments herein, R5 is alternatively an<br>
optionally substituted group selected from an aliphatic group,<br>
aralkyl group, heterocyclylalkyl group and an aryl group. In<br>
more specific embodiments, R5 is methyl, ethyl, propyl, 2-propyl,<br>

fluorobenzyl, 4-methylbenzyl, 4-(2-propyl)benzyl, or 4-<br>
trifluoromethylbenzyl. More specifically, R5 is ethyl or an<br>
optionally substituted benzyl; or R5 is ethyl or benzyl.<br><br>

that provide an amine (or amine salt) (i.e., under conditions<br>
for deprotecting the cbz-protected amine of the tert-leucine,<br><br>
such as, e.g., H2, Pd/C, citrate acid ((CO2H) 2)) ; after<br>
deprotection the resultant amine is reacted with 4-amino-3-<br>
chlorobenzoic, or a derivative thereof that is suitable for<br>
coupling to an amine (e.g., 4-amino-3-chlorobenzoyl chloride),<br>
under appropriate coupling conditions, to provide the compound<br>
of formula IV.<br>
[062] According to another embodiment, the invention provides a<br>
process for preparing a compound of formula IV:<br><br>

process for preparing a compound of formula IA:<br><br>
comprising the step of selectively crystallizing a compound<br>
of formula:<br><br>

[068] This selective crystallization step comprises combining the<br>
compound of formula IA/C (i.e., a mixture of IA and IC) and<br>
toluene (either at room temperature or above) and warming the<br>
combination with stirring to dissolve the compound of formula<br>
IA/C and cooling the combination with stirring. Upon cooling,<br>
the compound of formula IA is obtained as a crystalline solid<br>

[086] Any amines obtained as described herein, may be used with<br>
or without isolation from the reaction mixture. The desired<br>
caspase inhibitor prodrug may be derived from, e.g., V, VII, or<br>
the free amine of XIV (either as depicted or in the reduced<br>
form) by attaching the appropriate P2, P2-P3, or P2-P3-P4 moiety.<br>
A coupling of an amine with such a moiety may be carried out<br>
using the corresponding carrboxylic acid, or reactive equivalent<br>
thereof, under standard amide bond-forming or coupling<br>
conditions. A typical coupling reaction includes a suitable<br>
solvent, the amine in a concentration ranging from about 0.01 to<br>
10M, preferably about 0.1 to 1.0M, the requisite carboxylic<br>
acid, a base and a peptide coupling reagent.<br>
[087] If an amine is used without isolation, the coupling/ may be<br>
carried out in situ in the solvent of the reaction mixture used<br>
in the preparation of the amine, or in a different solvent. To<br>
this reaction mixture, the requisite carboxylic acid may be<br>
added and the reaction maintained at a temperature in the range<br>
of about 0° to 10 0° C, preferably between about 2 0° to about 4 0°<br>
C. The base and peptide coupling reagent are then added, to the<br>
mixture, which is maintained at a temperature in the range of<br>
about 0° to about 6 0°C, preferably between about 2 0° to about<br>
40°C. The base is typically a tertiary amine base, such as<br>
triethylamine, diisopropylethylamine, N-methylmorpholine , DBU,<br>
DBN, N-methylimidazole, preferably triethylamine or<br>
diisopropylethylamine. The amount of base used is generally up<br>
to about 20 equivalents per equivalent of the amine (e.gIV),<br><br>
preferably at least about 3 equivalents of base. Examples of<br>
peptide coupling reagents include DCC<br>
(dicyclohexylcarbodiimide), DIC (diisopropylcarbodiimide), di-p-<br>
toluoylcarbodiimide, BDP (1-benzotriazole diethylphosphate-1-<br>
cyclohexyl-3-(2-morpholinylethyl) carbodiimide) , EDC (l-(3-<br>
dimethylaminopropyl-3-ethyl-carbodiimide hydrochloride),<br>
cyanuric fluoride, cyanuric chloride, TFFH (tetramethyl<br>
fluoroformamidinium hexafluorophosphosphate), DPPA<br>
(diphenylphosphorazidate), BOP (benzotriazol-1-<br>
yloxytris(dimethylamino)phosphonium hexafluorophosphate), HBTU<br>
(0-benzotriazol-l-yl-N,N,N' ,N' -tetramethyluronium<br>
hexafluorophosphate), TBTU (0-benzotriazol-l-yl-N,N,N',N'-<br>
tetramethyluronium tetrafluoroborate ) , TSTU (0-(N-<br>
succinimidyl)-N,N,N' ,N'-tetramethyluronium tetrafluoroborate) ,<br>
HATU (N-[(dimethylamino)-1-H-l,2,3-triazolo[4,5,6]-pyridin-H-<br>
ylmethylene]-N-methylmethanaminium hexafluorophosphate N-oxide) ,<br>
B0P-C1 (bis(2-oxo-3-oxazolidinyl)phosphinic chloride), PyBOP<br>
((1-H-l,2,3-benzotriazol-l-yloxy)-tris(pyrrolidino)phosphonium<br>
tetrafluorophopsphate), BrOP<br>
(bromotris(dimethylamino)phosphonium hexafluorophosphate), DEPBT<br>
(3-(diethoxyphosphoryloxy) -1,2,3-benzotriazin-4(3H)-one) PyBrOP<br>
(bromotris(pyrrolidine)phosphonium hexafluorophosphate). EDC,<br>
HOAT, BCP-C1 and PyBrOP are preferred peptide coupling reagents.<br>
The amount of peptide coupling reagent is in the range of about<br>
1.0 to about 10.0 equivalents. Optional reagents that may be<br>
used in the amide bond-forming reaction include DMAP (4-<br>
dimethylaminopyridine) or active ester reagents, such as HOBT<br>
(1-hydroxybenzotriazole), HOAT (hydroxyazabenzotriazole), HOSu<br>
(hydroxysuccinimide), HONB (endo-N-hydroxy-5-norbornene-2,3-<br>
dicarboxamide) , in amounts ranging from about 1.0 to about HO . 0<br>
equivalents.<br><br>
[088] Alternatively, one may treat an amine with a reactive<br>
equivalent of the R3COOH carboxylic acid, such as P2-, P3-P2-, or<br>
P4-P3-P2-C (=O)X1, where C(=O)X1 is a group that is more reactive<br>
than COOH in the coupling reaction. Examples of -C(=O)X1 groups<br>
include groups where X1 is Cl, F, OC(=O)R (R = aliphatic or<br>
aryl), SH, SR, SAr, or SeAr.<br>
[089] A number of chemical groups are known that may be used as<br>
the P3-P2- portion of the ICE or caspase inhibitor prodrug.<br>
Examples of such P3-P2- groups are shown in Table 1 as part of a<br>
P4-P3-P2- moiety.<br><br><br><br>
where n is zero to three; AA refers to an amino acid side chain;<br>
X is N, 0, S, SO, SO2, CHF, CF2, C(R3)2, C=O, or C=NOR; A2 is 0, S<br>
or H2; Y is N or CH; R is hydrogen, C1-12 alkyl group, aryl group,<br>
or heteroaryl group, the R groups being optionally substituted<br>
with one or more halogen; R3 is an alkyl having one to six<br>
carbons; R4 is R-CO, ROC=O, RNHC=O, RC(O)C=O, or RSO2; and R5 is<br>
hydrogen, halo, alkyl, alkoxy, haloalkyl, haloalkoxy, amino,<br>

aminosulfonyl, or cyano; and R6 and R7 are independently selected<br><br>
from R3, aryl, heteroaryl, (C1-12 alkyl)aryl,<br>
(C1-12)benzocycloalkyl, or (C1-12 alkyl) heteroaryl.<br>
[090] Preferred P4-P3-P2- groups are shown in Table 2.<br><br><br><br>
where R6 is an optionally substituted benzyl as des cribed<br>
below or 2-indanyl, and the P4 moiety is represented by ZR-T-,<br>
wherein R-T- is R-CO, ROC=O, RNHC=O, RC(O)C=O, or RSO2 .<br>
[091] Preferred R groups of P4 are shown in Table 3.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
  where positions 3 and 5 of R are independently and<br>
optionally substituted by halogen, preferably chloro, or C1-3<br>
alkyl, and position 4 is optionally substituted by amino,<br>
acetamido, hydroxy or methoxy.<br>
[093] The most preferred P4-P3-P2- groups are shown in Table 4.<br><br>
where R is, referring to Table 3, one of the following<br>
groups: 100, 105, 107, 108, 114, 117, 119, 126, 136, 139, 140,<br>
and 141.<br><br>
[094J In attaching the P4-P3-P2- moiety, or portion thereof, the<br>
moiety may be attached in one piece as or subunits of the moiety<br>
may be added in a sequential manner as described above. For<br>
example, Cbz-protected proline may be coupled to XV (or if R5 is<br>
ethyl with II):<br><br>
[095] After removal of the Cbz group, a P3 or P3-P4 moiety may be<br>
attached by alkylation or acylation of the proline nitrogen.<br>
[096] In certain embodiments, methods of the present process<br>
proceed through the butenolactone XV where X is chloro, bromo or<br>
iodo:<br><br>
A preferred starting butenolactone is the bromofuranone XV<br>
(wherein X = Br), which may be obtained according to Escobar et<br>
al., An. Quim., 1971, 67, 43. Alternatively, other reactants of<br>
the formula GIIA and GIIB may be commercially available or<br>
produced from know methods. See, for example, "Comprehensive<br>
Organic Transformations: A Guide to Functional Group<br>
Preparations," 2nd Edition, by Richard C. Larock, pages 638,<br>
659, 661, 724.<br>
[097] Also within the scope of this invention, another embodiment<br>
of the coupling reaction of an amine proceeds by acylation of<br>
the anion of the amine using a reactive equivalent of the<br>
carboxyiic acid, such as P2-, P2-P3-, or P2-P3-P4-C (=O) X, where<br>
C(=O)X is as described above. The anion of the amine is first<br>
generated by treating the amine in a solvent with any suitable<br><br>
base. Examples of solvents that may be used include ethereal<br>
solvents such as THF, DME, dioxane, diethyl ether, methyl-tert-<br>
butyl ether; aromatic hydrocarbons, such as benzene, toluene,<br>
xylene; halogenated hydrocarbons, such as dichloromethane,<br>
carbon tetrachloride, dichloroethane; or other organic solvents,<br>
such as acetonitrile. Preferred solvents include THF, DME,<br>
toluene or dichloromethane. Suitable bases for generating the<br>
anion include organic bases such as an alkali metal hydride, an<br>
alkali metal tert-butoxide, an alkyl or aryl lithium, such as<br>
methyl-, butyl- or phenyllithium; an alkali metal amide, such as<br>
lithium-, sodium- or potassium bis(trimethylsilyl)amide,<br>
diisopropylamide, or tetramethylpiperidine. Preferred bases<br>
include lithium bis(trimethylsilyl)amide, lithium<br>
diisopropylamide, or lithium tetramethylpiperidine. The anion<br>
of the amine is treated with the carboxylic acid equivalent at a<br>
reaction temperature that may be in the range of about -78°C to<br>
12 0°C, preferably between about 0°C to 6 0°C.<br>
[098] Reduction conditions for reducing the double bond in the<br>
furanone ring may also be used as deprotection conditions. For<br>
example, when R3 (in XIV) or R6 (in X) is cbz, conditions may be<br>
used to reduce the double bond and to also remove the cbz group.<br>
[099] Methods herein describe a sequence in which the<br>
butenolactone is first coupled to a caspase Px or Px-y moiety and<br>
then the ring double bond is reduced. Alternatively, the<br>
reduction and coupling may be performed in reverse order.<br>
[0100] In still another embodiment, this invention provides a<br>
process for preparing a compound of formula XVI:<br><br><br>
wherein R3 is a P4-P3-P2 moiety of a caspase inhibitor, the P4-P3-<br>
P2 is c-1 of Table 2, the P4 is 108 of Table 3, R5 is as defined<br>
herein (e.g., ethyl) and the process is according to the methods<br>
herein.<br>
[0101] This invention also provides a process for preparing a<br>
compound of formula IVA:<br><br>
comprising selective crystallization of a compound of formula:<br><br>
from toluene.<br>
[0102] Alternatively, a process for preparing a compound of<br>
formula IVA:<br><br>
comprises dynamic crystallization of a compound of formula:<br><br><br>
by contacting the mixture of IA/C with a Lewis acid in a solvent<br>
optionally including a protic acid.<br>

a base in a solvent optionally including a phase transfer<br>
catalyst.<br><br>
[0104] Also provided are methods of preparing the corresponding<br>
aldehyde compound (of e.g., XVI) by these processes. For<br>
example, compound IV prepared according to this invention, may<br>
be converted to the corresponding aldehyde compound, that is by<br>
converting the furanone to an aldehyde.<br>
[0105] In another embodiment, this invention provides a process<br>
for preparing a compound of formula XVI:<br><br>

P2 is d-1 of Table 2, P4 is 141 of Table 3, R5 is as defined<br>
herein (e.g., ethyl), and the process is according to the<br>
methods herein.<br>
[0106] Accordingly, this compound (see compound 412f and/or<br>
corresponding compound 412 as disclosed in WO 97/22619, which is<br>
incorporated herein by reference) is prepared by reacting a<br>
compound of formula II : <br>
and an appropriate amide compound, in the presence of a<br>
palladium catalyst, a palladium ligand, a base, optionally a<br>
phase transfer catalyst and an appropriate solvent. An<br>
appropriate amide compound would be derived from the P4-P3-P2<br>
group d-la in Table 4, i.e., a compound:<br><br><br>
wherein R is either H or an isoquinolinoyl (i.e., the P4 group<br>
141 in Table 3, wherein there is a carbonyl linker between the<br>
compound and the isoquinolinoyl group.<br>

Preparation of 4-bromo-5-ethoxy-5H-furan-2-one<br>
[0128] This procedure may be carried out in a manner similar to<br>
that described by C. Escobar, et al. , Ann. Quim. (1971), 67, 43-<br>
57.). To a solution of 5-ethoxy-5H-furan-2-one (II, R1=Et) (10.0<br>
g, 78.0 ramol) in carbon tetrachloride (50 mL) at 0°C is added<br><br>
over 0. 5h a solution of bromine (4.05 mL, 78.2 mmol) in carbon<br>
tetrachloride (25 mL). The reaction is stirred lh at 0°C, then<br>
2h at room temperature. The solvents are removed under reduced<br>
pressure and. the residue was short-path distilled at pump vacuum<br>
(about 0.5mm). The fraction collected at 100°C-120°C provided<br>
4-bromo-5-ethoxy-5H-furan-2-one (13.2 g, 82% yield) as a yellow<br>

Pd(0Ac)2 (0.36 g, 1.6 mmol), XANTPHOS (1.4 g, 2.4 mmol) was<br>
charged. Th.e system was purged with nitrogen gas for 10 min.<br>
Toluene was added (2 00 mL) , and the reaction was stirred with<br>
warming to 50 °C. After reaching 50 °C, the reaction was<br>
stirred for 3 0 min. The mixture changed from a yellow slurry to<br>
a brick-red solution as the amide dissolved and the<br>
(XANTPHOS) Pd (OAc) 2 complex formed. A solution of K2CO3 (26.6 g,<br>
192 mmol) in water (2 00 mL) was added and the reaction was<br>
allowed to warm to 50 C.<br>

toluene (30 mL) was charged. The reaction is stirred until a<br>
solution is formed (slight warming may be necessary because the<br>
dissolution is endothermic). The solution of the bromide is<br>
added slowly to the catalyst/amide solution at 50 °C over 3-3.5<br>
hr. After the addition was complete, stirring of the reaction<br>
mixture was continued at 50 °C for 4 hours. While still at 50<br>
°C, the phases were separated and the aqueous phase discarded.<br>
The organic phase was washed with water (100 mL) at 50 °C. The<br>
phases were separated and the aqueous phase discarded. The<br>
organic phase was concentrated to % volume and cooled to ambient<br>
temperature. Seeds were added (50 mg) if crystallization has<br>
not begun. The mixture was stirred at ambient temperature for<br><br>
15 hr (overnight), cooled to 0 °C and stirred for 3-5 hr. The<br>
solid was filtered and rinsed with cold toluene. The solid was<br>
dried in vacuo at 40-50 °C to give a white crystalline solid<br>
(10.8 g, 36% yield).<br>
[0131] In an alternative synthesis, a flask was charged with<br>
Pd2(dba)3 (4.18 g, 4.6 mmol), Xantphos (7.90 g, 13.7 mmol), CBZ-<br>
Proline amide (50 g, 201 mmol), Cs2CO3 (65.5 g, 201 mmol) and<br>
toluene (770 mL). The mixture was stirred at 35 °C for 30 min,<br>
to give a brown/yellow mixture.<br>
[0132] Bromoethoxyfuranone (41.7 g, 201 mmol) as a solution in 30<br>
mL toluene was added to the brown/yellow mixture. The solution<br>
was warmed to 80 °C. After 15 min, HPLC analysis showed 90%<br>
reaction complete (comparing CBZ-proline amide and product), and<br>
no bromoethoxyfuranone remained. Another 4.1 g of<br>
bromoethoxyfuranone was added to the reaction mixture at 85 °C.<br>
After stirring for 3 0 min, HPLC analysis showed 97% reaction<br>
completion. Another 2.8 g of bromoethoxyfuranone was added.<br>
After stirring for 45 min, HPLC analysis showed no CBZ-proline<br>
amide remaining. The mixture was cooled to 20-25 °C, and water<br>
(200 mL) was added, followed by saturated aqueous sodium<br>
hydrogen sulfate (400 mL). Gas evolution was observed. The<br>
phases were separated and the organic phase was washed with<br>
saturated aqueous sodium hydrogen sulfate, then water. The<br>
organic phase was dried over sodium sulfate, filtered, and the<br>
solvent was removed in vacuo. The resulting crude material was<br>
purified by flash chromatography (1:1 EtOAc:hexanes, then 3:1<br>
EtOAc:hexanes) to give 55.7 g (74% yield) of the desired product<br>

and 10.0 g of 10% Pd/C (50% wet) . The reactor was purged with<br>
nitrogen for 10 minutes. 800.0 mL of ethyl acetate, followed by<br>
19.5 mL of trifluoroacetic acid were then added. The reactor<br>
was then closed, pressurized to 60 psi with hydrogen followed by<br>
venting. This cycling was repeated twice. The reaction was<br>
stirred for 2 hours under hydrogen (60 psi) . The palladium<br>
catalyst was filtered through a pad of celite, and the filtrate<br>
was held at 4 °C until needed for the subsequent coupling step.<br>

stirred at 22 °C for 2 hours. Water (400 mL) was added, and the<br>
biphasic mixture was stirred for 12 hours at 22 °C. This<br>
biphasic mixture was then transferred to a 4-liter separatory<br>
funnel, and the aqueous layer was removed. The organic layer<br>
was washed with 400 mL of saturated sodium bicarbonate solution<br>
followed by water (2 X 400 mL) . The ethyl acetate was distilled<br>
under vacuum to a final volume of approximately 400 mL. To this<br>
crude solution was charged 200 mL of tieptane, followed by<br>
seeding with 1.0 g of the compound of example 3 . The cloudy<br>
