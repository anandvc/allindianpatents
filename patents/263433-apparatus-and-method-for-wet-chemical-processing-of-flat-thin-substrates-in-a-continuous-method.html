				<td>Title: Apparatus and Method for Wet-Chemical Processing of Flat, Thin Substrates in a<br>
Continuous Method<br>
Description<br>
The invention relates to a method and an apparatus for the wet-chemical processing of flat,<br>
thin and fracture-sensitive substrates for microelectronic, micromechanical, and optical<br>
applications, wherein wet-chemical processes such as cleaning, etching, stripping, coating,<br>
and drying are used in a continuous method (inline) for the production of microelectronic<br>
components, solar cells, etc.<br>
The wet process technique for the production of microelectronic components is presently<br>
carried out primarily in bath processes, wherein the substrates, which are accommodated in<br>
magazines, are immersed in process baths. The process is carried out discontinuously in<br>
batches of 1 to 50 substrates. The use of continuous (inline) wet process systems, for<br>
example for the production of solar cells, is on the rise, wherein the substrates located on<br>
rollers or belts are continuously conveyed into process baths or are sprayed in spray modules<br>
with media, such as process chemicals or water, and then dried with warm air or nitrogen,<br>
which may optionally be enriched with isopropanol. The presently available wet-chemical<br>
processes are limited to immersion processes and spraying processes, which were<br>
developed and optimized substantially for standard substrates in the semi-conductor industry.<br>
In modern microelectronics and thin-film technology, in the future increasingly thinner<br>
substrates will be used, for example with substrate thicknesses of less than 100 Âµm. These<br>
practically film-like, very fracture-sensitive substrates cannot be processed in magazines and<br>
immersion basins because on the one hand the requirements with respect to transportation<br><br>
stability, and on the other also the productivity criteria, are not met. Some process<br>
requirements, such as one-sided processing, are also not possible. While existing inline<br>
process systems for the simultaneous processing of a large number of such substrates in a<br>
continuous method meet the throughput criteria, they are associated with unacceptably high<br>
breakage rates and cannot be employed for all necessary process types.<br>
The method described hereinafter, and the apparatus that is described, meet all the<br>
requirements for an inline process device for thin, fracture-sensitive substrates, both with<br>
respect to the transport (handling) within the process path and also with respect to the<br>
expanded processes for all required applications through the use of microporous,<br>
compressible rollers. By using such rollers, forces perpendicular to the transport direction are<br>
avoided, and at the same time the rollers allow uniform coverage of the substrates with the<br>
process media, either on both sides or only on the front or back of the substrate. As a result,<br>
during processing not only chemical, but also physical methods with direct cleaning contact<br>
are effective through the controlled interaction with the process media. In addition, a rinsing<br>
and drying step can be integrated in the same method.<br>
In the present method, the substrates to be processed are guided in a continuous method via<br>
rotating, media-compatible sponge rollers that are installed on one side or both sides.<br>
Absolutely uniform movement is achieved by coupling the drives on at least one side. The<br>
media (liquid or gaseous) required for the desired process are applied directly or indirectly<br>
during the pass and are removed again in rinsing and drying steps. Depending on the<br>
embodiment, processing can be performed on one side or both sides of the substrates, and a<br>
plurality of process steps (using the same or different media) can be combined in one<br><br>
process line by stringing process modules together. This line can have one or more lanes.<br>
The method can end both with wet or dry substrates.<br>
Description of different embodiments and illustrations:<br>
The substrates 1 (FIG. 1) to be processed are fed horizontally to a process module 2A.<br>
Feeding is carried out in that the substrate is transported on rollers 3 or on bands or belts, or<br>
by an alternative handling system (such as robots), to the rollers 4 and 5 of the process<br>
modules 2A.<br>
As soon as the substrate is picked up by the porous, compressible rollers 4 and 5, the<br>
substrate is conveyed further by identical, subsequent rollers of the process module 2A. The<br>
rollers are characterized in that they absorb the process medium used in the process module<br>
2A, wherein the medium is fed from an immersion bath 6 or spraying device 7, or directly<br>
through the core of the rollers 8, and in that they transmit the process medium to the<br>
substrate surface due to the contact of the rollers 9 and 10 (FIG. 2) with the surface of the<br>
substrate 11. The rolling motion of the roller fed with the process medium on the substrate<br>
surface at the same time effects a friction effect, which supports the process and intensifies<br>
processing during cleaning, etching, stripping, and rinsing.<br>
In an alternative method, which can also be combined with that described above, the<br>
distance of the rollers 12 and 13 (FIG. 3) can be configured such that between the rollers 12<br>
and 13 process media can additionally be guided by spray nozzles 14. Furthermore, the<br>
spray nozzles can be configured as ultrasonic or megasonic nozzles.<br><br>
Coverage of the lower rollers 15 and 16 can optionally be achieved by the direct absorption of<br>
the process medium from the tub 17, or according to the above-described embodiment of the<br>
upper rollers via spray nozzles, and can additionally be supported by ultrasonic or megasonic<br>
excitation (18) of the process medium. The media can also be fed to the roller 19 (FIG. 4)<br>
through the roller core 20 in that the roller core is provided with bores 21 for discharging the<br>
media. Due to the microporous structure of the roller, the process medium reaches the roller<br>
body and/or roller surface and, in the apparatus that is described, the surfaces of the<br>
substrate to be processed.<br>
Depending on the substrate type and the desired process, both the vertical distance 23 of the<br>
rollers in relation to the substrate (FIG. 6) and the horizontal distance 22 of the rollers to one<br>
another as well as the roller quantity 24 can be configured in accordance with the process<br>
requirements and substrate type. Likewise, the pressure of the rollers on the substrate can be<br>
brought about in accordance with the desired process and substrate type by means of fine<br>
adjustment, gravity (pressure of the upper rollers on the lower rollers), or by actuators<br>
(pneumatic, electric, or hydraulic).<br>
The rollers are rotated by electric drives in that the roller rotation and thus the substrate<br>
transport is continuously variable.<br>
Alternatively, a process wherein the rollers rotate in opposite directions, for example during<br>
cleaning processes, is possible (FIG. 5) in that the roller contact pressure of the rollers 25,<br>
26, 27 and 28 performing the substrate transport is accordingly higher in relation to the<br>
substrate than the roller contact pressure of the rollers 29 and 30, and in that the rollers 29<br>
and 30 rotate opposite to the direction of rotation of the rollers 25, 26, 27 and 28 and/or<br>
opposite to the transport direction of the substrate, thus creating an additional cleaning effect.<br><br>
Likewise, rollers having different roller diameters (FIG. 7) 31, 32, 33 and 34 can be used for<br>
the transport and processing, if they are adapted in their combination to the process (see<br>
FIG. 7). In addition, the rotational speed of each roller can be individually controlled and, in<br>
combination with the roller pressure and roller direction of rotation, can be associated with<br>
every roller in order to achieve appropriate process control during the individual processes.<br>
For different, consecutive processes, such as etching, rinsing, drying, the process modules<br>
can be set up successively in a line 2A, 2B, 2C (see FIG. 1) and be separated from one<br>
another with respect to the different process media by separating walls, comprising a slot for<br>
continuous substrate transport. Separation of the process modules from one another can also<br>
be achieved solely by the rollers and appropriate process media supply in that the last rollers<br>
within the process modules are supplied a reduced media volume.<br>
Drying of the substrate surface, for example after spraying processes, is likewise performed<br>
substantially by the microporous rollers. However, these rollers are not supplied a process<br>
medium. Due to the rolling motion of the dry roller across the substrate surface, the roller<br>
absorbs liquid from the surface (see FIG. 8). The absorbed liquid is continuously removed<br>
through additional wiping and/or rolling 36 and 37 (FIG. 8) of the rollers 39 and 39 used for<br>
the drying process, thus preparing the roller for further absorption of liquid in a process run.<br>
Likewise, the liquid absorbed by the roller can be removed from the substrate surface in that<br>
the absorbed liquid is suctioned out of the roller through the perforated roller core 20 (FIG. 4)<br>
by a vacuum.<br>
In a second embodiment, surface drying after absorption of the liquid following the rolling<br>
motion of the rollers on the substrate surface can occur in that following the last roller the<br><br>
substrate surface is inflated with gases, which can additionally be heated, such as heated<br>
nitrogen or hot air, and by heating the substrate, for example by means of infrared radiation<br>
or heating rods, or in a combination of the described methods.<br>
In a further, alternative embodiment, residue-free surface drying of the substrates can be<br>
carried out by introducing a gas-steam mixture into the liquid on the substrate surface,<br>
wherein the steam can be mixed with the liquid and mixing results in reduced surface tension<br>
of the liquid on the interface between the substrate and roller surfaces compared to the liquid<br>
without admixed steam. This method, known as the Marangoni effect or surface tension<br>
gradient drying, can be applied to the present invention, as is shown in FIG. 9. Due to the<br>
rolling motion of the rollers 40 and/or 41, the liquid previously absorbed from the wet<br>
substrate surface during rolling of the rollers, or the liquid additionally fed to the rollers<br>
according to the possibilities described above, produces a meniscus between the roller and<br>
substrate surface. From the nozzles 45 and/or 46, the gas-steam mixture is conducted in the<br>
direction of the meniscus through flow-conducting outlets 47 and/or 48. If the steam<br>
penetrates the liquid meniscus, mixing and therefore a reduction in surface tension in relation<br>
to the liquid outside of the meniscus are brought about. This results in a force (Marangoni<br>
force) in the direction of the liquid region having higher surface tension outside of the<br>
meniscus, which causes the substrate to dry. This drying process is substantially free of<br>
particles and residue.<br>
The one-sided surface treatment of a flat substrate can occur in that the substrate 49 (FIG.<br>
10) is fed on conveying rollers 50 to a process roller 51, which is supplied with a process<br><br>
medium 52 and transfers the process medium 53 onto the substrate surface during the rolling<br>
motion across the substrate. The appropriate arrangement of the conveying rollers 50<br>
prevents them from coming in contact with the process roller 51.<br>
A further possibility of one-sided surface treatment can occur in that the substrate 54 (FIG.<br>
11) is transported with the surface to be processed by the rollers 55, which are immersed in a<br>
process medium and during rotation of the rollers during the substrate transport transmit this<br>
medium 56 to the substrate bottom. If this substrate 57 (FIG. 12) is additionally pressed<br>
against the soft rollers 58 by pressure rollers 59 (FIG. 13), also the substrate edge is treated<br>
with the process medium.<br><br>
