Description<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a method and its apparatus for the separation of butene-1 from a C4 hydrocarbon mixed gas including butene-1, trans-2-butene, cis-2-butene, normal butane, isobutane, etc. by using a hybrid process composed of an adsorption process and a distillation process.<br>
Background Art<br>
The known method for the separation of butene-1 from a C4 hydrocarbon mixed gas including C4 olefins (butene-1, trans-2-butene, cis-2-butene, et.) and C4 parafins (normal butane, isobutane, etc.) involves mainly a distillation process. However, the known method requires the use of distillation towers with a large number of frac¬tionation plates due to the small boiling-point differenc of the products to be separated and thus leads to high consumption of energy and to high investment costs.<br>

U.S. patent 4,718,986(1988) discloses a process for producing butene-1 of more than 99wt% from the C4 hydrocarbon mixture of butene- 1/isobutane/normal butane/ butene-2 by using two distillation towers. According to the above patent invention, the C4 mixture is introduced into the first distillation tower to remove isobutane from the top of the tower. The lower stream from the first distillation tower is introduced into<br>

2 5 SEP 2009<br><br>
the second distillation tower, obtaining butene-1 with a purity of 99wt% from the top of the second tower and discharging a mixture of normal butane, butene-2 and butene-1 from the bottom of the second tower. However, since a considerable amount of butene-1 is discharged with the isobutane stream from the top of the first tower and also with the mixture of normal butane, butene-2 and butene-1 from the bottom of the second tower, the above process results in much loss of butene-1.<br>
There are a number of known techniques relating to the adsorption-separation processes for a C4 hydrocarbon mixture, for example, a technique for separating butene-1 from a mixture including butene-l/butene-2/isobutylene by using type X or Y zeolite containing potassium ion or barium ion (US 3,723,561, Mar. 27, 1973), a technique for separating butene-1 from a liquid C4 hydrocarbon mixture by using type K-X zeolite (US 4,119,678, Oct. 10, 1978), a technique for separating normal C4 hy¬drocarbon mixture and isobutylene by using a molecular sieve selective to normal C4 hydrocarbon mixture (US 4,455,445, Jun. 19, 1984), a technique for selectively separating alfa olefin alone from olefins having more than 4 carbon atoms by a liquid adsorption process using a zeolite molecular sieve (US pat. 5,132,485, 1992), a pressure-swing adsorption process for the separation of olefins/paraffins having 2-6 carbon atoms in vapor phase by using type 4A zeolite (US pat 5,365,011, 1994), and a technique for separating paraffins from a mixture of olefins/paraffins having 2-6 carbon atoms in vapor phase using type X or Y zeolite and reproducing the adsorbents used in the adsorption process by using desorbents (EP 0708070 Bl, 1999). The U.S. patent no. 5, 955,640 (1999) discloses a process of improving the yield of butene-1 by converting butene-2 components into butene-1 while removing a portion of paraffin components by using an adsorption process in order to prevent the accumulation of un-reacted paraffin components in the process.<br>
However, distillation using two towers connected in series as shown in the above U.S. patent no. 4,718,986 (1998) is the only process used for obtaining butene-1 with high purity from the C4 olefins/paraffins mixture gas. Till now, there is no adsorptive-separation techniques that can separate butene-1 with high purity from a mixture of C4 olefins/paraffins by selectively separating C4 olefin mixture gas from C4 olefins/ paraffins mixture by an adsorption process and then obtaining high purity butene-1 from C4 olefin mixture gas selectively separated from the adsorption process by a dis¬tillation process, as can be achieved by the present invention.<br>
Disclosure of Invention Technical Problem<br>
The existing distillation processes for separating betene-1 from a mixture of olefins/<br>
3<br>
2 5 SEP 2009<br><br>
paraffins use two sequential distillation towers to remove isobutane from the first dis¬tillation and obtain high purity butene-1 from the second distillation tower. However, a significant amount of butene-1 is discharged together with a isobutane stream to the top of the first tower and also discharged to the bottom of the second distillation tower and thus butene-1 loss is large. In addition, since the difference in relative volatilities among C4 components is small, the above distillation processes require high consumption of energy and high investment costs.<br>
Technical Solution<br>
In the above circumstance, the inventors of the present invention have designed a hybrid process of removing paraffins by the C4 olefins/paraffins adsorption separation process and thereafter separating the C4 olefins via distillation to obtain high purity butene-1.<br>
If olefins are selectively separated from the C4 olefins/paraffins mixture gas by using the adsorption separation process, the paraffin components are selectively removed, butene-1 loss which is accompanied at the time of removing isobutane can be reduced, also the concentration of the normal butane in the gas introduced into the distillation process for the production of high purity butene-1 is lowered, and thus the production of butene-1 is easy and the yield of butene-1 in the whole process increases.<br>
Advantageous Effects<br>
The present invention can reduce the butene-1 loss and investment costs over the process consisted only of multi-stage distillation tower by using a hybrid process consisted of a olefins/paraffins adsorption separation process and a olefin distillation process.<br>
Now, some embodiments of the present invention are illustrated with reference to the drawings accompanied. However, it is understood that the illustrated embodiments of the present invention are intended to be examples only and the invention is not limited to any embodiments.<br>

Mode for the Invention<br>
The detailed description of the invention with reference to the drawings is as follows.<br>
Fig. 1 is a schematic view of the process constitution for separating C4 olefins from a mixture gas of C4 olefins/paraffins according to the present invention. The process of the present invention comprises an adsorption process for separating the mixture of C4 olefins/paraffins and a distillation process for separating high purity butene-1 from the C4 olefins mixture gas separated from the adsorption process. The mixture of C4 olefins/paraffins is introduced into the adsorption process through the conduit (1). The paraffin components which were not adsorbed on the adsorbents from the mixture of C4 olefins/paraffins is discharged through conduit (2), and the adsorbed olefin components is desorbed by the desorbents and introduced into the distillation process(B) through conduit (3). If the olefin mixture gas containing butene-1 and butene-2 together with small amount of isobutane and normal butane is introduced into the distillation process, butene-1 and isobutane having lower boiling points is discharged to the top (conduit (4)) of the distillation tower and normal butane and butene-2 components having relatively higher boiling points is discharged to the bottom (conduit (5)) of the distillation tower. The olefin rich mixture gas produced from the adsorption process has about 0 to 0.5wt% level of isobutane and 0 to 5wt% of normal butane as a much amount of isobutane and normal butane is removed. If necessary, isobutane and normal butane may be completely removed.<br>

The distillation tower (B) in the present invention is a distillation tower for separating high purity butene-1 from C4 olefin mixture gas produced from the adsorption facility.<br>
Fig. 2 is a schematic view of the apparatus of producing butene-1 from a mixture gas of C4 olefins/paraffins according to the present invention. The adsorption facility of the apparatus of the present invention comprises three adsorption towers for separating C4 olefins via selective adsorption and two distillation towers for separating C4 olefins/desorbents and C4 paraffins/desorbents respectively. The basic process of the adsorption tower used in the present invention includes an adsorption step of se¬lectively adsorbing C4 olefins from feed, a C4 olefin rinse step of removing a small amount of C4 paraffins adsorbed together with C4 olefins; and a C4 olefin desorption step using the desorbents and the process further can includes pressure equalization step, cocurrent depressurization step, and pressurization step. The desorbent discharged from the adsorption step along with olefins or paraffins is separated in the distillation tower and then recycled into the adsorption tower. The preferable desorbents is C5 hy¬drocarbon or C6 hydrocarbon which has a large difference in boiling point from that of the C4 mixture.<br>
A cycle operation of the adsorption process can be described with reference to Fig 2 on the basis of Fig. 3 which includes the operation steps of all the preferable adsorption process as follows.<br>
The mixture gas containing C4 olefins/paraffins is introduced into the adsorption tower (AD-1) loaded with olefin selective adsorbents through the conduit (1) and valve (la) to adsorb C4 olefins thereon (adsorption step), and the olefin free paraffin stream separated from the mixture is introduced together with the desorbents retained in the adsorption tower before the adsorption step into the distillation tower (Dl) through the conduit (5) and the valve (5a) to separate paraffins and desorbents. The adsorption tower (AD-2) carries out the step (desorption step) of desorbing olefin components with the desorbent while the adsorption tower (AD-1) carries out the adsorption step. The desorbents used in the desorption step is obtained from the bottoms of the dis¬tillation tower (Dl) and the distillation tower (D2) and is introduced into adsorption tower (AD-2) through the conduit (6) and the valve (6b). The olefins discharged with the desorbents is introduced into the distillation tower (D2) through the valve (2a) and<br>
2 5 SEP 2009<br><br>
the conduit (2) to separate the olefins and the desorbents. The adsorption tower (AD-3) is provided with a portion of the olefins separated from the distillation tower (D2) through the conduit (3) and the valve (3c) to remove a small amount of paraffins adsorbed together with the olefins for the improvement of the purity of olefins (C4 olefin rinse step). At that time, the gas discharged from the adsorption tower (AD-3) is introduced into the distillation tower (Dl) through the valve (4c) and the conduit (4). The adsorption tower (AD-1) at high pressure which just carried out the adsorption step is connected with the adsorption tower (AD-2) at low pressure through the valve (4a) and the conduit (4) and thus a process (pressure equalization step) that allows the pressures of both towers to be in the same pressure is carried out. During the pressure equalization step, the valve (7) is closed. The adsorption tower (AD-3) after the rinse step carries out a desorption step of recovering olefins by introducing the desorbents thereto through the conduit (6) and the valve (6c). The olefins discharged together with the desorbents from the adsorption tower (AD-3) is sent to the distillation tower (D2) through the valve (2c) and the conduit (2) and thus separated from the desorbent.<br>
In addition, in the adsorption process, the adsorption tower (AD-1) after the pressure equalization step is depressurized through the valve (4a) and the conduit (4), and at that time, the discharged gas is introduced into the distillation tower (Dl) (cocurrent depressurition step). During the cocurrent depressurization of the adsorption tower (AD-1), a C4 mixture gas is introduced into the adsorption tower (AD-2) through the conduit (1) and the valve (lb) and the adsorption tower (AD-2) carries out a step (pressurization step) of increasing the pressure to the adsorption pressure. At that time, the adsorption tower (AD-3) continues to carry out the desorption step.<br>
The adsorption tower (AD-1) which just finished the cocurrent depressurization step carry out a C4 olefin rinse step, the adsorption tower (AD-2) carries out the adsorption step, and the adsorption tower (AD-3) continues to carry out the desorption step.<br>
In this way, each adsorption tower carries out a sequential adsorption step - pressure equalization step - cocurrent depressurization step - C4 olefin rinse step - desorption step - pressure equalization step - pressurization step.<br>
The pressure equalization step, the cocurrent depressurization step or the pres¬surization step can be omitted from the constitution of the process depending on the processing pressure of the adsorption step.<br>
In addition, as can be seen in Fig. 4, the C4 olefins/paraffins mixture gas can be firstly distilled to give isobutane/butene-1 rich stream and normal butane/butene-2 rich stream and then the resulting isobutane/butene-1 rich stream can be fed into the adsorption process to obtain high purity butene-1, in place of obtaining high purity butene-1 by first processing the C4 olefins/paraffins mixture gas via the adsorption process to separate C4 olefins and then separating butene-1 from the resulting C4<br>

olefins via the distillation process. In this case, paraffins, i.e., isobutane and olefin, i.e., butene-1 are separated by the same process as that described in said adsorption process.<br>
Example 1<br>
As shown in Fig. 1, the C4 mixture gas (table 2) was introduced into the adsorption process to separate C4 olefins and paraffins and then the separated C4 olefins was introduced into the distillation process to produce butene-1. The adsorption process was carried out by the facility of Fig. 2 according to the process constitutions of Fig. 3. With the cycle sequence as shown in Fig. 3 by using the apparatus as shown in Fig. 2, an experiment for separating olefins from a mixture gas of C4 olefins/paraffins was performed while using type 13X zeolite as an adsorbent for the separation of olefins/ paraffins and using C5 mixture gas as a desorbent. The compositions of the C4 mixture gas and of the C5 mixture gas were shown in table 2. The C4 mixture gas was introduced into the adsorption process at the conditions of 60°C, 2000 mmHg and the flow rate of 1675 ml/min. A portion of high purity olefin containing gas obtained from the top of the distillation (D2) as shown in Fig 2 was used in the C4 olefin rinse step, and the rinse flow rate was 300 ml/min. The high purity olefin containing gas obtained from the adsorption process was introduced into the distillation tower having 115-stage tray and thus obtained 99.54wt% of butene-1 with a yield of 99.54wt% at reflux ratio of 9. The composition of the products obtained from each of the conduits according to the method of Fig. 1 is presented in table 3.<br>
