				<td>TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to radio communication systems. More<br>
particularly, and not by way of limitation, the present invention is directed to an<br>
apparatus and method for transmitting independent data streams from a plurality<br>
of radio antennas.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
The capacity of a wireless channel can be enhanced greatly by utilizing<br>
multiple transmit and multiple receive antennas. This has been demonstrated by<br>
open-loop multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) schemes, such as the Bell Labs<br>
Layered Space-Time (BLAST) architecture. Open-loop MIMO schemes do not<br>
require any feedback link from the receiver to the transmitter, as in closed-loop<br>
MIMO schemes. However, by exploiting instantaneous channel-state information<br>
provided to the transmitter by the receiver as in closed-loop MIMO schemes, the<br>
channel capacity is further enhanced. Closed-loop MIMO schemes include<br>
Eigenmode-BLAST, which is an optimum closed-loop MIMO scheme, and Per<br>
Antenna Rate Control (PARC), which achieves the open-loop MIMO capacity. In<br>
PARC, an independently coded and modulated data stream is transmitted from<br>
each transmit antenna. The coding rate for each data stream is provided by the<br>
receiver via a feedback mechanism.<br>
While optimum closed-loop MIMO schemes require a large amount of<br>
instantaneous channel information to be fed back from the receiver to the<br>
transmitter, PARC requires much less feedback. However, PARC does not<br>
perform well in certain conditions, such as low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)<br>
conditions, systems with correlated antennas, systems with fewer receive<br>
antennas than transmit antennas, and channels with Ricean fading. In such<br>
conditions, the MIMO channel often cannot support the transmission of as many<br>
data streams as the number of transmit antennas (as done in PARC). This limits<br>
the capacity of PARC.   This problem was partly solved by Selective-PARC (S-<br><br>
PARC), which is an extension of PARC. S-PARC transmits as many data streams<br>
as can be supported by the channel by using the same number of transmit<br>
antennas as there are data streams. S-PARC performs better than PARC in the<br>
above-mentioned conditions. However, since S-PARC may not utilize all transmit<br>
antennas, its capacity is significantly lower than optimum closed-loop MIMO.<br>
Thus, what is needed in the art is a closed-loop MIMO scheme that<br>
overcomes the deficiencies of conventional systems and methods by utilizing all<br>
transmit antennas to transmit an adaptive number of data streams. The present<br>
invention provides such a system and method.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is a system and method for implementing in a radio<br>
communication system, a closed-loop MIMO scheme that utilizes, in one<br>
embodiment, all transmit antennas to transmit an adaptive number of data<br>
streams. This is done by partitioning the set of transmit antennas into mutually<br>
exclusive subsets to transmit independent data streams after "co-phasing". The<br>
term "co-phasing" refers to a procedure in which relative phase rotations are<br>
applied to a data stream transmitted from multiple antennas. The concept of co-<br>
phasing is similar to beamforming, except that co-phasing is performed based on<br>
instantaneous channel-state information fed back to the transmitter by the<br>
receiver. The relative phase rotations (co-phasing angles) are designed to<br>
maximize the received signal power, which approximately maximizes channel<br>
capacity. An iterative algorithm may be used for finding the co-phasing angles.<br>
The scheme, referred to herein as "Multiple Stream Co-phasing" (MSC), requires<br>
similar complexity and feedback as S-PARC. However, MSC significantly<br>
outperforms S-PARC and achieves close to the capacity of optimum closed-loop<br>
MIMO for many channels of interest.<br>
Thus, in one aspect, the present invention is directed to a method of<br>
transmitting multiple independent data streams from subsets of a plurality of<br>
transmit antennas. The method includes determining by the receiver, a partitioning<br><br>
of the plurality of transmit antennas that provides the highest channel capacity<br>
among all possible partitionings, and providing information regarding the<br>
determined partitioning to the transmitter. The transmitter partitions the plurality of<br>
transmit antennas into mutually exclusive subsets in accordance with the<br>
determined partitioning information, applies a relative phase rotation to each<br>
antenna, and transmits an independent data stream from each partitioned subset<br>
of antennas.<br>
In another aspect, the present invention is directed to a method of<br>
transmitting a data stream from a selected subset of a plurality of transmit<br>
antennas. The method includes partitioning by the receiver, the plurality of<br>
transmit antennas into a plurality of subsets; and calculating by the receiver for<br>
each subset, a relative phase rotation to be applied to each transmit antenna in<br>
the subset, and a stream capacity for the subset with the relative phase rotations<br>
applied. The receiver then selects a subset having the highest stream capacity<br>
and sends information to the transmitter regarding the selected subset. The<br>
transmitter then transmits the data stream from the selected subset of transmit<br>
antennas after applying the relative phase rotations to the transmit antennas in the<br>
selected subset.<br>
In yet another aspect, the present invention is directed to a radio system for<br>
transmitting multiple independent data streams from subsets of a plurality of<br>
transmit antennas. A receiver includes means for determining a partitioning<br>
of the plurality of transmit antennas that provides the highest channel capacity<br>
among all possible partitionings, and means for sending information regarding the<br>
determined antenna partitioning to a transmitter. The transmitter includes means<br>
for partitioning the plurality of transmit antennas into mutually exclusive subsets in<br>
accordance with the determined partitioning information; means for applying a<br>
relative phase rotation to each transmit antenna; and means for transmitting an<br>
independent data stream from each partitioned subset of transmit antennas.<br>
In still yet another aspect, the present invention is directed to a radio<br>
system for transmitting a data stream from a selected subset of a plurality of<br><br>
transmit antennas. The system includes a receiver having means for partitioning<br>
the plurality of transmit antennas into a plurality of subsets; and means for<br>
calculating for each subset, a relative phase rotation to be applied to each<br>
transmit antenna in the subset, and a stream capacity for the subset with the<br>
relative phase rotations applied. The receiver also selects a subset having the<br>
highest stream capacity, and sends information to the transmitter regarding the<br>
selected subset. The system also includes a transmitter comprising means for<br>
transmitting the data stream from the selected subset of transmit antennas after<br>
applying the co-phasing angles to the transmit antennas in the selected subset.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
FIG. 1 is a flowchart illustrating the steps of an exemplary overall multi-<br>
stream co-phasing process performed by a transmitter and receiver in accordance<br>
with the teachings of the present invention. At step 11, the receiver determines<br>
channel-state information in a process shown in more detail in FIG. 2 and 2B. In a<br>
preferred embodiment, the channel-state information includes an optimum<br>
antenna partitioning into K subsets, co-phasing angles for each antenna, and<br>
stream capacity (i.e., rate) information for the optimum antenna partitioning. At<br>
step 12, the receiver sends the channel-state information to the transmitter. At<br>
step 13, the transmitter de-multiplexes an input signal into K independent streams<br>
based on the antenna-partitioning information received from the receiver. Each<br>
stream may be coded and modulated at a rate which is not greater than the<br>
stream capacity. Each stream may also be scaled. At step 14, the transmitter<br>
partitions the antennas into K subsets and applies the co-phasing angles to each<br>
antenna in accordance with the channel-state information. At step 15, the<br>
transmitter transmits the K data streams from the K subsets of antennas.<br>
Thus, based on instantaneous channel-state information received over a<br>
feedback channel from the receiver, the transmitter divides an input data signal<br>
into K separate streams and sends parallel sequences of data symbols (streams)<br>
to multiple antennas. Different phase rotations applied to each antenna eliminate<br>
mutual interference.   By transmitting K streams in parallel, the transmission time<br><br>
required to send K symbols is reduced to one channel use. The total transmission<br>
rate is the sum of all of the separate stream rates.<br>
FIG. 2 is a flowchart illustrating the steps of an exemplary process for<br>
computing channel-state feedback information by the receiver in accordance with<br>
the teachings of the present invention. The receiver analyzes each possible<br>
partition and determines a partition that provides the highest channel capacity<br>
(i.e., total transmission rate) among all possible partitionings. If the transmitter<br>
does not support all possible partitions, the receiver may analyze only those<br>
partitions that are supported by the transmitter. Each partition identifies the<br>
number of antenna subsets, which antennas are in each subset, the capacity of<br>
the data stream to be transmitted from each antenna subset, and what co-phasing<br>
angles are to be applied to the antennas in each subset.<br>
The process begins at step 21 with the first partition n out of J partitions to<br>
be analyzed. Given the number of transmit and receive antennas, the receiver<br>
determines all possible (or desirable) transmit antenna set partitions. The receiver<br>
also knows (or estimates) the channel response matrix H and the noise variance<br><br><br>
are determined using equation (9)<br>
N0.    At step 22, the co-phasing angles<br>
and an iterative technique described below. At step 23, a prefilter weight matrix<br>
W(n) is computed using equation (4). At step 24, a prefiltered channel G(n) is<br>
computed as the product of W(n) and a channel impulse response matrix H using<br>
equation (5). At step 25, the channel capacity C(n) for the first partition is<br>
evaluated using equation (6). At step 26, the process determines whether all J<br>
partitions have been analyzed. If not, the process iterates n = n+1 at step 27, and<br>
returns to step 21 to analyze the next possible partition. If all of the J partitions<br>
have been analyzed, the process moves to step 28, where the receiver selects the<br><br><br><br>
partition that maximizes capacity<br><br>
At step 29, it is determined whether<br><br><br><br><br>
is equal to one, where<br><br>
is the number of input streams corresponding to the<br><br><br><br><br>
selected partition. If<br><br>
the process moves to step 30 and determines the<br><br><br><br><br>
stream capacity. If<br><br>
the method moves to step 31 where the stream capacity<br><br><br>
for each input stream<br><br>
is obtained using equation (12). At step 32, the<br><br>
receiver sends predefined channel-state information to the transmitter.<br>
FIG. 2B is a flowchart illustrating the steps of an alternative exemplary<br>
process for computing channel-state feedback information by the receiver in<br>
accordance with the teachings of the present invention. The receiver analyzes<br>
each possible partition and determines a partition that provides the highest<br>
channel capacity (i.e., total transmission rate) among all possible partitionings. If<br>
the transmitter does not support all possible partitions, the receiver may analyze<br>
only those partitions that are supported by the transmitter. Each partition<br>
identifies the number of antenna subsets, which antennas are in each subset, the<br>
capacity of the data stream to be transmitted from each antenna subset, and what<br>
co-phasing angles are to be applied to the antennas in each subset.<br>
The process begins at step 210 with the first partition n out of J partitions to<br>
be analyzed. Given the number of transmit and receive antennas, the receiver<br>
determines all possible (or desirable) transmit antenna set partitions. The receiver<br>
also knows (or estimates) the channel response matrix H and the noise variance<br>
N0. At step 220, the receiver begins with the last data stream in the n-th partition.<br><br><br>
At step 230, the co-phasing angles<br>
are determined using equation (14) and<br>
an iterative technique described below. At step 240, the capacity of the k-th data<br>
stream is estimated using (17). At step 250, the process determines if all data<br>
streams have been evaluated. If not, the process iterates k = kA at step 260. At<br>
step 270, the total capacity for the n-th partition is computed using (18). At step<br>
280, the process determines whether all J partitions have been analyzed. If not,<br>
the process iterates n = n+1 at step 290, and returns to step 210 to analyze the<br>
next possible partition. If all of the J partitions have been analyzed, the process<br>
moves to step 300, where the receiver selects the partition that maximizes<br><br><br>
capacity<br><br>
At step 310, the receiver sends predefined channel-state<br><br>
information to the transmitter.<br><br>
FIG. 3 is a flowchart illustrating the steps of an exemplary process for<br>
utilizing channel-state feedback information by the transmitter to maximize<br>
transmission capacity in accordance with the teachings of the present invention.<br>
At step 34, the transmitter receives the instantaneous channel-state information<br>
from the receiver. In one embodiment, the channel-state information includes an<br>
optimum antenna partitioning into K subsets, co-phasing angles for each antenna,<br>
and stream capacity (i.e., rate) information for the optimum antenna partitioning.<br>
At step 35, the transmitter partitions the transmit antennas into K subsets as<br>
indicated by the channel-state information. At step 36, an input signal is de-<br>
multiplexed into K independent data streams, which are optionally coded,<br>
modulated, and scaled at step 37. At step 38, the transmitter applies the co-<br>
phasing information to the antennas in each subset, and at step 39, transmits<br>
independent data streams in parallel through each antenna subset. The following<br>
sections describe in more detail, the processes performed in both the receiver and<br>
the transmitter.<br>
Consider a communication system with M transmit antennas and N receive<br>
antennas (i.e., an M x N MIMO system). Suppose that the channel is quasi-static<br>
and flat fading. The baseband system model can be written as:<br><br>
where [x1,x2,...,xM]r is the transmitted signal, [y1,y2,...,yN]r is the received signal,<br>
H = {h1.1} is the N x M channel impulse response matrix, and [w1,w2,...,wN]T is a<br>
Gaussian noise vector with mean zero and covariance matrix N0IN, where<br>
IN denotes an N x N identity matrix. The total average transmit power is pr..<br><br>
The transmitted signal is obtained as:<br><br>
where [S1,S2,...,SK]1 is the input signal demultiplexed into K„TM streams which can<br>
be independently coded and modulated and W is an M x K prefilter weight matrix.<br>
The following describes a method for determining the prefilter weight matrix.  It is<br><br>
assumed that the channel impulse response matrix H and the noise variance N0<br>
are known at the receiver. A person skilled in the art will appreciate that the true<br>
values can be replaced by their estimates.<br>
Let A(n) = {ƒÑl(n),ƒÑ2(n),...,ƒÑK(n)} be the n-th partition of the set of transmit<br>
antenna indices {1,2,...,M}. The set ƒÑk(n) contains the indices of the antennas<br>
used for the transmission of the k-th input stream in the n-th partition. The sets<br>
contained in a partition are constrained to be mutually exclusive and have at least<br>
one element each. The prefilter weight matrix for the n-th antenna set partition is<br>
given by:<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
where<br><br>
is an M x 1 column vector with<br><br>
non-zero elements<br><br>
in rows<br><br><br>
is the co-phasing<br>
mƒÕƒÑk(n) and zero elements in the remaining rows, where<br>
angle in radians for the k-th data stream and the m-th transmit antenna<br>
(corresponding to the m-th row and the /c-th column of the prefilter weight matrix),<br>
and |ƒÑ| refers to the size of the set ƒÑ.<br>
The prefiltered channel is given by:<br><br>
The capacity of this scheme is given by:<br><br><br>
The co-phasing angles ƒákm(n) can be found by maximizing channel capacity.<br>
It can be seen that at low SNR, this is equivalent to maximizing the trace of the<br>
prefiltered channel autocorrelation matrix G"(n)G(n) , given by:<br><br><br><br>
to find the co-phasing angles. The trace metric, which equals the total received<br>
signal power, is also a non-linear function of the angles. However, the trace<br>
metric decouples in the input streams, which enables the co-phasing angles to be<br>
found independently for each data stream. Based on the trace metric, the co-<br>
phasing angles for the k-th stream can be found by using the partial derivatives:<br><br><br><br>
for each mƒÕƒÑk(n).<br><br><br>
It can be seen that the optimum co-phasing angles<br><br>
satisfy the<br><br>
equations:<br><br><br><br>
where<br><br>
Note that for each data stream, the co-phasing angle for one of the transmit<br><br><br>
antennas can be arbitrarily set to zero (or another value), i.e.<br><br>
for one<br><br>
m'ƒÕƒÑk(n). Also note that equation (9) is non-linear in the co-phasing angles,<br><br><br><br>
except when<br><br>
In this case, we have<br><br>
and<br><br><br><br>
for ƒÑk(n) = {m',m"}. An iterative algorithm can be used to determine the co-phasing<br>
angles for |ƒÑk{n)|&gt;2.   Initially, all co-phasing angles may be set to zero (or some<br>
other value). In each iteration, the angles are updated using equation (9) in a<br>
parallel or serial fashion. In the parallel case, the angles in the current iteration<br>
are determined using the angles in the previous iteration only, while in the serial<br>
case, the angles in the current iteration are determined using the angles in the<br>
previous iteration and the previously-updated angles in the current iteration.<br>
The receiver performs the process shown above in FIG. 2, and if it is<br><br><br>
determined at step 29 that<br><br>
the stream capacity for each input stream<br><br><br>
is obtained at step 31 as:<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
where<br><br>
is the k-th column of the matrix<br><br><br><br><br><br>
matrix given by<br><br>
The selected partition<br><br>
is signaled<br><br><br><br><br>
to the transmitter along with the<br><br>
is the largest rate in<br><br><br><br><br>
bits per symbol less than or equal to<br><br>
which is supported by the transmitter,<br><br><br>
set). The amount of feedback required is thus M real coefficients plus a log2 J bit<br>
integer, where J is the number of possible (or desirable) partitions.<br>
Next we describe an alternative method for finding the co-phasing angles in the<br>
present invention. The channel capacity can also be expressed as<br><br>
where Ck(n) is the capacity of the k-th data stream (stream capacity), given by<br><br><br><br>
where wk(n) is the k-th column of the matrix W(n), and wk(n) is an Nx(K-k + 1)<br><br><br>
can be<br>
matrix given by wk(n) = [wk(n),wk+1(n),...,wK(n)]. The co-phasing angles<br>
found to maximize the channel capacity. However, since the channel capacity is a<br>
complex non-linear function of the angles, the optimization is hard to achieve.<br>
Instead, we propose to find the co-phasing angles for a data stream that maximize<br>
the stream capacity, given the co-phasing angles of the higher-order streams. The<br>
scheme is described below in detail.<br>
The co-phasing angles for the K-th data stream are first found by maximizing the<br>
capacity of the K-th data stream, given by<br><br><br><br>
This is equivalent to maximizing the received signal gain for the K-th data stream,<br>
given by<br><br><br><br>
Before we describe how the angles are actually computed for the K-th data<br>
stream, let us consider the metric that has to be maximized in order to compute<br>
the angles for the other data streams. Suppose that the co-phasing angles for the<br><br><br>
k+1,k+2,...,K data streams have been estimated and are given by<br><br>
respectively. Given these estimates, the angles for the k-th data stream<br><br>
can  be found   by  maximizing  the  corresponding  stream  capacity,  which  is<br>
equivalent to maximizing the whitened received signal gain, given by<br><br><br><br>
data stream, the received signal is white and therefore the whitened received<br>
signal gain equals the received signal gain.<br>
Next we describe how the co-phasing angles are computed using the<br>
above metric. The co-phasing angles for the k-th data stream can be found by<br>
using the partial derivatives:<br><br>
Note that for each data stream k, the co-phasing angle for one of the<br>
transmit antennas (say m) in the subset ƒÑk(n)can be arbitrarily set to zero (or<br><br><br><br><br>
for ƒÑk(n) = {m',m"}. An iterative algorithm can be used to determine the co-phasing<br>

regular lines denote scalars. The MMSE feedforward filter and the feedback filter<br>
for the k-th stream (stage) are given by:<br><br>
respectively. The input to the k-th decoder is:<br><br>
The k-th decoder produces an estimate of the k-th input stream ŝk.<br>
Example<br>
Consider the example of a 4 x 2 MIMO system. From the theory of MIMO<br>
channels, we know that an optimum number of input streams that can be<br>
transmitted is less than or equal to min(M,N)=2. There are eight possible transmit<br>
antenna set partitions in this case: one with single input stream (K=1), the rest<br>
with two input streams (K=2). The partitions are:<br>
A(1)={ {1,2,3,4}}, A(2)={ {1,2,3}, {4}}, A(3)={ {1,2,4}, {3}}, A(4)={ {1,3,4}, {2}},<br>
A(5)={ {2,3,4}, {1}}, A(6)={ {1,2}, {3,4}}, A(7)={ {1,3}, {2,4}} and<br>
A(8)={{1,4},{2,3}}.<br>
The prefilter weight matrices corresponding to these antenna set partitions<br>
are given below in order.<br><br><br>
An integer with 3 bits can be used to signal the selected partition to the<br>
transmitter. The eight possible outcomes of this integer corresponding to the<br><br>
respectively.<br>
The receiver feeds back the channel state information to the transmitter. In<br>
a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the feedback information<br>
comprises the partition selection (which can be signaled by means of an integer<br>
as described above) and the rates and angles of the selected partition.<br>
FIG. 6 is a simplified block diagram of an embodiment of the system of the<br>
present invention. The system includes the receiver 50 in a first node (Node-1) 52<br>
and the transmitter 40 in a second node (Node-2) 53. Functionally, the receiver<br>
may include an optimum partitioning determination unit 54 and a feedback<br>
channel 55 in addition to normal receiver components. The optimum partitioning<br>
determination unit determines channel-state information for a received signal 56.<br>
The channel-state information may include partitioning information relating to an<br>
optimum partitioning of the transmit antennas 57 into K subsets. The partitioning<br>
determination unit 54 also determines the capacity of the data streams to be<br><br>
transmitted from each subset, and co-phasing angles for the transmit antennas in<br>
each subset. The feedback channel 55 sends this information 58 to the<br>
transmitter 40.<br>
In the transmitter 40, an antenna partitioning demultiplexer 42 de-<br>
multiplexes the input signal 41 into K independent streams based on the antenna-<br>
partitioning information received from the receiver. Each stream may be coded<br>
and modulated at a rate which is not greater than the stream capacity. Each<br>
stream may also be scaled. The transmitter partitions the transmit antennas 57<br>
into K subsets, and antenna phase rotation units 45 apply the co-phasing angles<br>
to each transmit antenna in accordance with the information provided by the<br>
receiver 50. The transmitter then transmits the K data streams 59 from the K<br>
subsets of antennas 57.<br>
When comparing the complexity of Multiple Stream Co-phasing (MSC) with<br>
S-PARC, it can be concluded that the complexities are of the same order. The<br>
transmitters for the two schemes require similar complexity, with the only<br>
additional requirement for MSC being phase rotation. The receivers for the two<br>
schemes are identical. The only difference in complexity between MSC and S-<br>
PARC is in how the feedback coefficients are computed. For S-PARC, the<br>
feedback coefficients are computed by computing the capacity for all possible<br>
subsets of the set of transmit antennas and then computing the individual capacity<br>
of each stream (stream capacities) for the chosen subset. For MSC, the feedback<br>
coefficients are computed by computing the capacity for all possible partitions of<br>
the set of transmit antennas and then computing the stream capacities for the<br>
chosen partition.<br>
The number of subsets of the set of transmit antennas (except the null set)<br>
is 2M-1. It has been found that the number, of antenna set partitions for 2 x 2, 3 x<br>
3, and 4x4 MIMO systems are 2, 5, and 15, respectively. For example, the<br>
partitions for a 4 x 4 system (in addition to the partitions given earlier for a 4 x 2<br>
system) are:<br><br>
A(9)={ {1,2}, {3}, {4}}, A(10)={ {1,3}, {2}, {4}}, A(11 )={ {1,4}, {2}, {3}},<br>
A(12)={{2,3}, {1}, {4}}, A(13)={{2,4}, {1}, {3}}, A(14)={{3,4}, {1}, {2}}, and<br>
4(15)={{1},{2},{3},{4}}.<br>
For 2 x 2, 3 x 3, and 4x4 MIMO systems, the number of partitions (2, 5,<br>
and 15, respectively) is less than or equal to the number of subsets (3, 7, and 15,<br>
respectively). The two schemes thus require a similar number of capacity<br>
evaluations. An additional requirement for MSC is the computation of co-phasing<br>
angles for each partition. A closed-form expression, equation (11), is used for the<br>
computation of a single co-phasing angle. An iterative algorithm is used for the<br>
computation of multiple co-phasing angles. It has been found that two iterations<br>
of the serial iterative algorithm described above provides very good estimates.<br>
Thus, the complexities of MSC and S-PARC are of the same order.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, referred to as selective-<br>
MSC (S-MSC), the transmit antennas are utilized selectively as in selective-PARC<br>
(S-PARC). In S-MSC, all possible (or desirable) subsets of the set of transmit<br>
antennas are considered for transmitting input streams. The subset that achieves<br>
the highest capacity is selected.    The capacity for each subset S„~{i,2	A/}<br>
(except the null set) is found by partitioning the set S into all possible (or<br>
desirable) partitions (as in MSC) and evaluating the capacity for the partitions.<br>
The capacity for the set S is the maximum capacity over all partitions. S-MSC is<br>
useful at low SNR, when it may be better to not waste transmit power on an<br>
antenna that has weak signal power (below or not much higher than noise level).<br>
The receiver performs the antenna selection for S-MSC by hypothesizing each (or<br>
each desirable) subset of transmit antennas and finding the the best partition and<br>
the capacity for that subset. The subset that maximizes capacity is selected along<br>
with the partition. The receiver then signals this information to the transmitter.<br>
In yet another embodiment, only certain (desirable) partitions are<br>
considered. For example, for a 4 x 4 MIMO system, one may consider the<br>
partitions A(1)={ {1}, {2}, {3}, {4} } and A(2)={1,2,3,4} only. The first partition<br>
corresponds to sending four independent input streams on four antennas, and the<br><br>
second partition corresponds to sending one input stream on all four antennas<br>
after co-phasing.<br>
Other embodiments of the present invention include: (a) using alternative<br>
methods (metrics) for generating co-phasing angles, (b) quantizing rate and/or<br>
angle information for feedback, (c) using different power scaling of the streams<br>
based on the knowledge or an estimate of antenna gain disparity; and (d) using<br>
antenna correlation information.<br>
It has been found that MSC greatly outperforms S-PARC under many<br>
practical conditions including low SNR, correlated receive antennas, systems in<br>
which there are fewer receive antennas than transmit antennas, and Ricean<br>
fading. This is because, unlike S-PARC, MSC uses all antennas to transmit an<br>
adaptive number of data streams with co-phasing, which achieves high SNR. For<br>
a 4 x 4 MIMO system with Ricean fading (8 dB line of sight component), MSC<br>
obtains a gain of 3.8 dB over S-PARC at the rate of 3 bits per symbol. For many<br>
MIMO channels of interest, MSC gets very close to the capacity of an optimum<br>
closed-loop MIMO scheme for the entire SNR range. This is achieved with similar<br>
complexity and feedback requirements as S-PARC (which are much less than<br>
those for optimum closed-loop MIMO).<br>
As will be recognized by those skilled in the art, the innovative concepts<br>
described in the present application can be modified and varied over a wide range<br>
of applications. Accordingly, the scope of patented subject matter should not be<br>
limited to any of the specific exemplary teachings discussed above, but is instead<br>
defined by the following claims.<br><br>
