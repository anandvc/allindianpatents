INTRAVENOUS CATHETER INTRODUCING DEVICE<br>
This invention relates to an intravenous catheter<br>
introducing device, more particularly to an intravenous<br>
catheter introducing device with a needle cannula which is<br>
retractable into a barrel for safe disposal.<br>
Conventional medical devices or syringes for medicine<br>
injection, drawing blood samples, etc., have to be disposed<br>
of safely after use to avoid accidental needle pricks or<br>
undesirable contamination. Although a tip protector is<br>
provided to be sleeved on the device after use to ensure<br>
that the needle is covered, the user is exposed to the risk<br>
of being pricked by the needle when sleeving the tip protector<br>
on the used device. Therefore, there are available<br>
medical devices or syringes with a retractable needle that<br>
is retractable into a barrel or a plunger after the injection<br>
operation is completed, such as those disclosed in Indian<br>
Patent Application Nos. 368/KOL/04, 395/KOL/04, 692/KOL/06<br>
and 693/KOL/06 filed by the applicants. However, further<br>
improvements are desirable in order to ensure easy and safe<br>
retraction of the needle and to simplify the construction<br>
of medical devices or syringes.<br>
The object of the present invention is to provide an<br>
intravenous catheter introducing device which has a<br>
simplified construction and which can be operated easily<br>
and safely to retract a used needle cannula.<br>
According to this invention, the intravenous catheter<br>
introducing device includes a barrel, a needle cannula, a<br><br>
2<br>
needle hub, a biasing member, an engaging peg, a receptacle<br>
frame, an actuating unit, and a stabilizing unit.<br>
The barrel has front and rear open ends opposite to each<br>
other in a longitudinal direction, and a surrounding barrel<br>
wall which interconnects the front and rear open ends and<br>
which includes front and rear wall portions. The rear wall<br>
portion has an inner barrel wall surface which defines a<br>
passage, and which has a slotted path that extends through<br>
an outer barrel wall surface of the surrounding barrel wall,<br>
and that extends along the longitudinal direction to have<br>
starting and ending regions. The inner barrel wall surface<br>
further has a docking port which extends through the outer<br>
barrel wall surface, and which extends in a transverse<br>
direction to be communicated with the starting region so<br>
as to form a docking shoulder that faces towards the front<br>
open end.<br>
The needle cannula has a front segment terminating at<br>
a tip end, and a rear connecting end opposite to the front<br>
segment.<br>
The needle hub includes a front holding portion which<br>
is surrounded by the front wall portion and which holds the<br>
rear connecting end of the needle cannula, and a rear shell<br>
portion which is inserted into the passage such that the<br>
needle hub is slidable relative to the surrounding barrel<br>
wall along the axis between a position of use, where the<br>
front segment of the needle cannula extends forwardly of<br>
the front open end, and a disposal position, where the front<br><br>
3<br>
segment of the needle cannula retreats into the passage.<br>
Preferably, the needle hub further includes an intermediate<br>
viewing-window portion between the front holding portion<br>
and the rear shell portion.<br>
The biasing member is interposed between the rear shell<br>
portion and the inner barrel wall surface to bias the needle<br>
hub towards the disposal position.<br>
The engaging peg is configured to be anchored on the<br>
docking shoulder against the biasing action of the biasing<br>
member in the position of use, and extends from the rear<br>
shell portion radially so as to be externally manipulated<br>
to move from the docking shoulder to the starting region.<br>
The engaging peg is dimensioned to be slidable along the<br>
slotted path to the ending region so as to move the needle<br>
hub to the disposal position.<br>
The receptacle frame is disposed on the outer barrel<br>
wall surface, and includes front and rear guiding grooves<br>
which are spaced apart from each other in the longitudinal<br>
direction, and which cooperate with each other to define<br>
a guideway that extends over the docking port and the starting<br>
region in the transverse direction.<br>
The actuating unit includes a guided body and a pushing<br>
body. The guided body has first and second guided sides that<br>
are guided respectively in the front and rear guiding grooves<br>
when the actuating unit is moved along the guideway between<br>
normal and actuating positions. The pushing body is<br>
configured such that when the guided body is in the normal<br><br>
4<br>
position, the pushing body is distant from the engaging peg,<br>
and when the guided body is in the actuating position, the<br>
pushing body shoves the engaging peg to the starting region.<br>
The stabilizing unit is disposed between the guided body<br>
and the engaging peg, and is configured such that the engaging<br>
peg is kept moving with the guided body until the engaging<br>
peg reaches the starting region, thereby ensuring steady<br>
movement of the engaging peg between the docking shoulder<br>
and the starting region.<br>

Before the present invention is described in greater<br>
detail, it should be noted that same reference numerals have<br>
been used to denote like elements throughout the<br>
specification.<br>
Referring to Figs . 1 to 3, the first preferred embodiment<br>
of an intravenous catheter introducing device according to<br>
the present invention is shown to comprise a barrel 1, a<br>
needle cannula 41, a needle hub 2, a catheter connection<br>
assembly4, a tip protector 10, a biasingmember 5, anengaging<br>
peg 23, a receptacle frame 17, an actuating unit 3, and<br>
stabilizing unit 7.<br>
The barrel 1 has front and rear open ends 122, 121 opposite<br>
to each other in a longitudinal direction, and a surrounding<br>
barrel wall 12 which interconnects the front and rear open<br>
ends 122,121. The surrounding barrel wall 12 includes a<br>
small-diameter front wall portion 124 and a large-diameter<br>
rear wall portion 123 which are respectively disposed<br>
proximate to the front and rear open ends 122,121 to form<br><br>
7<br>
a shoulder 125 therebetween. The rear wall portion 123 has<br>
an inner barrel wall surface which surrounds an axis in the<br>
longitudinal direction and which defines a passage 11, and<br>
an outer barrel wall surface opposite to the inner barrel<br>
wall surface in radial directions relative to the axis. The<br>
inner barrel wall surface has a slotted path 13 which extends<br>
through the outer barrel wall surface, and which extends<br>
along the longitudinal direction to have starting and ending<br>
regions 131,130 that are opposite to each other, and that<br>
are respectively distal from and proximate to the rear open<br>
end 121. The inner barrel wall surface further has a docking<br>
port 132 which extends through the outer barrel wall surface,<br>
and which extends in a first transverse direction to be<br>
communicated with the starting region 131 so as to form a<br>
docking shoulder 133 that faces towards the front open end<br>
122. The inner barrel wall surface further has a plurality<br>
of ribs 126 formed at the shoulder 125. An end cap 18 is<br>
disposed to cover the rear open end 121. Preferably, the<br>
ending region 130 of the slotted path 13 is in a constricted<br>
form and extends into the end cap 18.<br>
The needle cannula 41 has a front segment terminating<br>
at a tip end 412, and a rear connecting end 411 opposite<br>
to the front segment along the axis. The needle hub 2 includes<br>
a front holding portion 21 which is surrounded by the front<br>
wall portion 124 and which holds the rear connecting end<br>
411 of the needle cannula 41, a rear shell portion 22 which<br>
is disposed opposite to the front holding portion 21 along<br><br>
8<br>
the axis to be inserted into the passage 11, and an<br>
intermediate viewing-window portion 25 which is interposed<br>
between the front holding portion 21 and the rear shell<br>
portion 22 for permitting viewing of blood flowing therein.<br>
Thus, the needle hub 2 is slidable relative to the surrounding<br>
barrel wall 12 along the axis between a position of use,<br>
where the front segment of the needle cannula 41 extends<br>
forwardly of the front open end 122, as shown in Fig. 3,<br>
and a disposal position, where the front segment of the needle<br>
cannula 41 retreats into the passage 11, as shown in Fig.<br>
6.<br>
The catheter connection assembly 4 includes a catheter<br>
hub 42 and a flexible tubular catheter 43.<br>
The tip protector 10 is removably sleeved on the barrel<br>
wall 12 for shielding the needle cannula 41.<br>
The biasing member 5 is a coil spring which is disposed<br>
in the rear wall portion 123, and which has a front biasing<br>
end 51 that engages the ribs 126, and a rear biasing end<br>
52 that engages the rears She11 portion 22 such that the biasing<br>
member 5 is in a compressed state when the needle hub 2 is<br>
in the position of use so as to bias the needle hub 2 towards<br>
the disposal position. Hence, the biasing member 5 is<br>
disposed to surround the rear shell portion 22, and will<br>
not conceal the intermediate viewing-window portion 25 to<br>
obstruct viewing of flashback blood flow.<br>
The engaging peg 23 is integrally formed with and extends<br>
radially from the rear shell portion 22. As shown in Fig.<br><br>
10<br>
peg 23 to pass through the opening 171 when the needle hub<br>
2 is moved from the position of use to the disposal position.<br>
The receptacle frame 17 includes a receiving groove 175<br>
which is disposed leftwardly of the slotted path 13, and<br>
which extends in the longitudinal direction to communicate<br>
the front guiding groove 170 with the rear guiding groove<br>
170 . The receiving groove 175 extends away from the slotted<br>
path 13 in a second transverse direction transverse to both<br>
the longitudinal direction and the first transverse<br>
direction to terminate at a shielding wall 176. The<br>
shielding wall 176 extends rightwards to terminate at a<br>
lateral edge 177.<br>
The receptacle frame 17 further includes front and rear<br>
jamb walls 14, 15 which are disposed rightwardly of the front<br>
and rear guiding grooves 170, respectively, and which are<br>
spaced apart from each other in the longitudinal direction<br>
to define a pushing path 140 . The receptacle frame 17 further<br>
includes front and rear tiny projections 141,151 which are<br>
disposed respectively on the front and rear jamb walls 14, 15.<br>
A lateral holding member 16 is disposed on the outer barrel<br>
wall surface of the barrel 1 and diametrically opposite to<br>
the pushing path 140 in the second transverse direction.<br>
The actuating unit 3 includes a guided body 31, a pushing<br>
body 33, and a faceplate 32.<br>
The guided body 31 has a major wall which extends in<br>
the longitudinal direction to terminate at first and second<br>
guided sides (31a, 31b) , and which has outer and inner major<br><br>
11<br>
surfaces 311,312 opposite to each other in the second<br>
transverse direction. The first and second guided sides<br>
(31a,31b) are guided respectively in the front and rear<br>
guiding grooves 170 when the actuating unit 3 is moved along<br>
the guideway 172. In this embodiment, the inner major<br>
surface 312 has a cavity 330 which extends towards the outer<br>
major surface 311 to terminate at a ceiling surface 313,<br>
and which extends in the first transverse direction to<br>
terminate at left and right wall surfaces 314,315 that<br>
accommodate the engaging peg 23 therebetween when the guided<br>
body 31 is guided along the guideway 172. The left and right<br>
wall surfaces 314, 315 extend rearwardly toforminthe second<br>
guided side 31b a port 332. As shown in Fig. 5, the port<br>
332 is registered with the slotted path 13 in the actuating<br>
position, thereby permitting the engaging peg 23 to be moved<br>
to the ending region 130.<br>
In this embodiment, the pushing body 33 is integrally<br>
formed with and is disposed on the right wall surface 315.<br>
Thus, when the actuating member 3 is in a normal position,<br>
as shown in Fig. 4, the pushing body 33 is distant from the<br>
engaging peg 23, and the engaging peg 23 is engaged with<br>
the docking shoulder 133. When the actuating member 3 is<br>
in an actuating position, as shown in Fig. 5, the pushing<br>
body 33 shoves the engaging peg 23 to cause the latter to<br>
disengage from the docking shoulder 133 and to reach the<br>
starting region 131.<br>
In this embodiment, the faceplate 32 is disposed on the<br><br>
1 2<br>
guided body 31 distal from the cavity 330 in the first<br>
transverse direction, and extends in the longitudinal<br>
direction to have front and rear fitted edges 321, 322 . The<br>
pushing path 140 is of such a dimension as to be fittingly<br>
engaged with the front and rear fitted edges 321,322 of the<br>
faceplate 32.<br>
In this embodiment, the stabilizing unit 7 is integrally<br>
formed with and is disposed on the left wall surface 314,<br>
and is formed with an auxiliary shoulder 71. Thus, referring<br>
to Fig. 4, in the normal position, the left anchoring abutment<br>
233 of the engaging peg 23 abuts against the auxiliary<br>
shoulder 71.<br>
In use, as shown in Figs. 3 and 4, the tip end 412 of<br>
the needle cannula 41 is inserted into the patient's vein<br>
so as to introduce the tubular catheter 43 into the vein.<br>
Blood flowing into the intermediate viewing-window portion<br>
25 of the needle hub 2 is visible so that the user can check<br>
whether the needle cannula 41 has been inserted properly<br>
into the vein to introduce the tubular catheter 43. The<br>
user can then separate the catheter hub 42 from the barrel<br>
1 with one finger of the hand holding the barrel 1.<br>
Subsequently, the user can press the vein and the tubular<br>
catheter 43 with the other hand to complete the IV catheter<br>
introducing procedure.<br>
As shown in Figs. 5 and 6, the user pushes the faceplate<br>
32 with the finger of the hand holding the barrel 1 along<br>
the pushing path 140 to reach the actuating position such<br><br>
13<br>
that the front and rear fitted edges 321, 322 of the faceplate<br>
32 are brought into a press-fit with the front and rear jamb<br>
walls 14,15 by slipping over the front and rear tiny<br>
projections 141,151. At this time, the auxiliary shoulder<br>
71 is caused to displace along with the guided body 31 to<br>
disengage from the left anchoring abutment 233 of the<br>
engaging peg 23. In addition, the pushing body 33 shoves<br>
the engaging peg 23 to the starting region 131. Consequently,<br>
the engaging peg 23 is permitted to move along the slotted<br>
path 13 by virtue of the biasing action of the biasing member<br>
5 so as to be retained in the constricted ending region 130,<br>
such that the needle hub 2 is displaced to the disposal<br>
position and the used needle cannula 41 is retracted into<br>
the passage 11.<br>
As illustrated, since the used needle cannula 41 can<br>
be disposed in the passage 11 immediately after completion<br>
of the IV catheter introducing procedure in a convenient<br>
and easy manner, accidental needlepricking can be prevented.<br>
Moreover, once the faceplate 32 is pushed, the front and<br>
rear fitted edges 321,322 are moved over the front and rear<br>
tiny projections 141, 151 to be in a press-fit with the front<br>
and rear jamb walls 14,15. Thus, the faceplate 32 is retained<br>
in the actuated position to prevent removal of the actuating<br>
unit 3 from the pushing path 140.<br>
As shown in Figs. 2 and 7, the major wall of the guided<br>
body 31 has a leading edge (31c) which joins the front and<br>
rear guided sides (31a, 31b), and which is to be received<br><br>
14<br>
in the receiving groove 175. The outer major surface 311<br>
of the guided body 31 has lower and elevated regions 316, 317<br>
respectively proximate to and distal from the leading edge<br>
(31c) . The elevated region 317 is raised to accommodate the<br>
contour of the ceiling surface 313 so as to form a head-on<br>
surface 318 which extends in the second transverse direction<br>
between the lower and elevated regions 316,317, and which<br>
is spaced apart from the lateral edge 177 by a clearance<br>
19 when the actuating unit 3 is in the normal position. In<br>
order to prevent undesired movement of the actuating unit<br>
3 during operation and carrying of the intravenous catheter<br>
introducing device, a safety guard 6 is provided, and has<br>
an insert portion 61 which is configured to be fittingly<br>
received in the clearance 19 so as to guard against<br>
inadvertent movement of the guided body 31 away from the<br>
normal position, and a head portion 62 which is disposed<br>
outwardly of the barrel 1 so as to permit detachment of the<br>
insert portion 61 from the clearance 19.<br>
Referring to Figs. 8 to 10, the second preferred<br>
embodiment of an intravenous catheter introducing device<br>
according to this invention is shown to be similar to the<br>
first embodiment in construction. The difference resides<br>
in that the pushing body 33 is disposed adjacent to the right<br>
wall surface 315, and extends from the inner major surface<br>
312 towards the docking port 132. In this embodiment, the<br>
faceplate 32 is disposed on the outer major surface 311 of<br>
the guided body 31. The stabilizing unit 7 includes a<br><br>
15<br>
retaining groove 24 which is formed in the stud end of the<br>
engaging peg 23 and which extends in the longitudinal<br>
direction, and a retaining pin 34 which is disposed adjacent<br>
to the left wall surface 314, and which extends from the<br>
ceiling surface 313 to be releasably retained in the<br>
retaining groove 24 . Thus, by the engagement of the retaining<br>
pin 34 with the retaining groove 24, the engaging peg 23<br>
is kept moving with the guided body 31 until the engaging<br>
peg 23 reaches the starting region 131, thereby ensuring<br>
steady movement of the engaging peg 23 between the docking<br>
shoulder 133 and the starting region 131. In addition, the<br>
retaining pin 34 is released from the retaining groove 24<br>
once the engaging peg 23 reaches the starting region 131<br>
so as tobe thrust towards the ending region 130 by the biasing<br>
member 5, as shown in Figs. 11 and 12.<br>
Referring to Figs. 13 to 15, the third preferred<br>
embodiment of an intravenous catheter introducing device<br>
according to this invention is shown to be similar to the<br>
second embodiment in construction. In this embodiment, the<br>
biasing member 5 is a coil spring which is disposed in the<br>
rear wall portion 123, and which has a front biasing end<br>
54 that engages the rear shell portion 22, and a rear biasing<br>
end 53 that engages the inner barrel wall surface adjacent<br>
to the rear open end 121 such that the biasing member 5 is<br>
in a tensed state when the needle hub 2 is in the position<br>
of use. In addition, the ending region 130 of the slotted<br>
path 13 in this embodiment is more elongated than that of<br><br>
16<br>
the second embodiment, and a pair of retaining protrusions<br>
134 are disposed in the ending region 130 such that the<br>
engaging peg 23, by moving over the retaining protrusions<br>
134, is retained in the ending region 130, thereby preventing<br>
forward movement of the needle hub 2.<br>
Referring to Figs. 16 to 20, the fourth preferred<br>
embodiment of an intravenous catheter introducing device<br>
according to this invention is shown to be similar to the<br>
second embodiment in construction. In this embodiment, the<br>
guided body 31 of the actuating unit 3 is a flat plate without<br>
the cavity, and the stabilizing unit 7 includes a retaining<br>
groove 24 which is formed in the stud end of the engaging<br>
peg 23 and which extends in the longitudinal direction, and<br>
a retaining pin 34 which is disposed on the inner ma j or surface<br>
312 adjacent to the pushing body 33, and which is releasably<br>
retained in the retaining groove 24. Moreover, the biasing<br>
member 5, like that of the third embodiment, is a coil spring<br>
which is disposed in a tensed state when the needle hub 2<br>
is in the position of use. In this embodiment, as the engaging<br>
peg 23 is slidable in the slotted path 13 and is disposed<br>
under the outer barrel wall surface in the ending region<br>
130, as shown in Fig. 20, forward movement thereof can be<br>
prevented for inhibiting reuse.<br>
To operate the engaging peg 23 for needle retraction,<br>
the user can hold the barrel 1 with one hand and operate<br>
the faceplate 32 with the same hand to cause the needle hub<br>
2 to move to the disposal position for drawing the used needle<br><br>
17<br>
cannula 41 into the passage 11. Therefore, the actuating<br>
operation is controllable by the user and is convenient and<br>
easy to conduct, and inadvertent needle-stick accidents can<br>
also be avoided. Moreover, the actuating unit 3 is compact<br>
in size for easy attachment to the barrel 1 so as to enable<br>
the device to have a compact and neat appearance.<br><br>
