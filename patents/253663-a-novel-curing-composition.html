TITLE OF THE INVENTfON:<br>
ALKYLATED POLYALKYLENEAMINES AND USES THEREOF<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0001]   The present invention relates generally to alkylated polyalkyleneannine compounds, curing agent and amine-epoxy compositions derived from such compounds, and articles produced from such compounds and/or compositions.<br>
[0002]   Certain epoxy resins which are cured, hardened, and/or crosslinked with amine-based curing agents are well known. These amine-epoxy materials are widely used in applications ranging from coatings, adhesives, and composites, to civil engineering applications such as formulations for concrete flooring.<br>
[0003]   Due to regulations on volatile organic compounds (VOC's), it can be beneficial to reduce or eliminate emissions from organic solvents. Thus, numerous waterborne curing agent compositions and waterborne amine-epoxy compositions have been developed over the past decade. Since no organic solvent is present in some of these aqueous amine-epoxy systems, the odor, environmental, and health risks often associated with the presence of organic solvents can be eliminated.<br>
[0004]    However, many industry problems remain with waterborne curing agent and amine-epoxy systems. For instance, coatings made from aqueous amine-epoxy compositions often have poor surface appearance, characterized in the industry by the terms blush, carbamation, and exudate. These problems, in part, are due to the incompatibility of the amine curing agent and the epoxy resin, which causes phase separation and results in amine migration to the coating surface. To address this issue, it is often necessary to modify the amine curing agent to improve compatibility, which can add cost and complexity.<br>
[0005]    In certain applications, it is desirable to formulate a waterborne curing agent to relatively low solids, for example, less than 40% solids, by dilution with water. Many aqueous curing agent compositions, unfortunately, cannot be diluted without causing phase separation of the formulation, which is evidenced by cloudiness in an otherwise<br><br>
clear formulation. Such phase separation is undesirable as it can lead to instability of the curing agent formulation during storage. In some cases, this problem can be addressed by diluting with water at the job site and only shortly before mixing the curing agent with the epoxy resin for use. In contrast to formulating a particular solids content in a controlled manufacturing environment, job-site formulating can lead to inconsistent blends and the introduction of contaminants, which can cause performance problems in the end-use application. Another method to improve the stability of the vv/aterborne product is to add an acid, such as a carboxylic acid. Typically, this approach adversely affects the water and chemical resistance properties of the final cured product.<br>
[0006]   Additionally, many waterborne amine-epoxy compositions have a short pot-iife, sometimes as short as 30 minutes to 2 hours. Pot life is the time available to apply a coating or film to a substrate after mixing the epoxy resin and hardener or curing agent. The end of the pot-life can be evidenced by a sharp a rise in formulation viscosity, or a detrimental change in properties such as gloss or hardness of the cured coating or film. Such reduction in properties is particularly problematic, as it is not possible to detect the problem until after the coating has been applied to a substrate and cured.<br>
[0007]   It is often found that when water-based amine-epoxy systems are applied to cementitious or concrete substrates, the water-based emulsion or dispersion is destabilized. This can result in poor appearance, reduced substrate adhesion, and decreased performance properties such as chemical resistance.<br>
[0008]   There are numerous aqueous amine-based curing agent and amine-epoxy compositions that are employed in the amine-epoxy coating industry; however, none of these known products completely addresses the needs or solves the problems noted above. Accordingly, it is to this end that the present invention is directed.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
AMINE AND EPOXY-AMINE COMPOSITIONS<br>
[0015]   The present invention discloses novel curing agent compositions and methods of making these curing agent compositions. A curing agent composition in accordance with the present invention can be used to cure, harden, and/or crosslink an epoxy resin. Such composition comprises the reaction product of:<br><br>
(a)	 at least one alkyiated polyalkylensamine and<br>
(b)	at least one potyalkylene potyether polyo! modified poiyepoxide resin.<br>
Generally, this curing agent composition has an amine hydrogen equivalent weight<br>
(AHEW) based on 100% solids from about 50 to about 500. In a different aspect, the<br>
curing agent composition has an AHEW based on 100% solids from about 60 to about<br>
400, or from about 80 to about 300. Further, the curing agent composition can have an<br>
AHEW based on 100% solids from about 100 to about 200.<br>
[0017]   In another aspect, the present invention provides a curing agent composition comprising the contact product of:<br>
(i)        the reaction product of:<br>
(a)	at least one alkylated polyalkyleneamine and<br>
(b)	at least one potyalkyiene polyether polyol modified poiyepoxide resin; and<br>
(ii)       at least one multifunctional amine having 2 or more active amine hydrogens.<br>
The curing agent composition in this aspect of the present invention can have an AHEW<br>
based on 100% solids from about 50 to about 500. Further, such curing agent<br>
composition can have an AHEW based on 100% solids in the range from about 55 to<br>
about 450, from about 60 to about 400, from about 70 to about 350, from about 80 to<br>
about 300, or from about 90 to about 250. In a different aspect, the curing agent<br>
composition has an AHEW based on 100% solids from about 100 to about 200.<br><br><br>
If the multifunctional amine is different from the alkylated polyalkyieneamine, AHEW2 can be catculated based on its chemical structure, or is often provided by the supplier of the amine in case of a mixture. The AHEW for the alkylated polyalkyieneamine compound, AHEWB, is determined using the following formula, assuming the polyalkyieneamine is the reductive amination product of x moles of aldehyde/ketone compound, for example, with 1 mole of a polyalkyieneamine compound, PAA (the polyalkyieneamine compound and the aldehyde/ketone compound are discussed in greater detail below):<br><br>
[0019]   The relative amount of the reaction product of the at least one alkylated polyalkyieneamine and at least one polyalkylene polyether potyol modified polyepoxide resin versus that of the multifunctional amine can vary. This variance depends upon, for example, the end-use article, its desired properties, and the fabrication method and conditions used to produce the end-use article.<br>
[0020]   Additionally, curing agent compositions described herein can be sotventless, also referred to as solvent-free or 100% solids. Alternatively, in another aspect of the present invention, these compositions can further comprise at least one diluent, such as, for example, water, an organic solvent, or an organic or inorganic acid. Appropriate organic solvents are well known to those skilled in the art of amine formulation chemistry. Exemplary organic solvents suitable for use in the present invention include, but are not limited to, benzyl alcohol, butanoL toluene, xylene, methyl ethyl ketone, and the like, or combinations thereof. Non-limiting examples of organic and inorganic acids are acetic acid, sulfamic acid, lactic acid, salicylic acid, sebacic acid, boric acid, phosphoric acid. and the like, or combinations thereof. Such acids can increase the solubility of a curing<br><br>
agent composition in water, for example. However, the use of acids can increase the water sensitivity of a cured amine-epoxy composition.<br>
[0021]   Aqueous or waterborne curing agent compositions are within the scope of the present invention. A water-based curing agent composition comprises the contact product of:<br>
(i)        the reaction product of:<br>
(a)	at least one alkylated polyalkyleneamine and<br>
(b)	at least one polyalkylene polyether polyol modified polyepoxide resin;<br>
(ii)       at least one multifunctional amine having 2 or more active amine hydrogens; and (iii)       water.<br>
[0022]   Cuhng agent compositions of the present invention can be produced with various reactant ratios of the modified polyepoxide resin to the alkylated polyalkyleneamine compound. It is within the scope of the present invention for the ratio of the number of stoichiometric epoxy groups in the at least one polyalkylene polyether polyol modified polyepoxide resin to the number of moles of the at least one alkylated polyalkyleneamine to be in a range from about 0.2:1 to about 1.3:1. In another aspect the ratio is about 0.25:1, about 0.3:1, about 0.4:1, about 0.5:1, about 0.6:1, about 0.7:1, about 0.8:1, about 0.9:1, about 1:1, about 1.1:1, about 1.2:1, or about 1.25:1. Yet, in another aspect, the ratio is in a range from about 0.3:1 to about 1.25:1, or from about 0.4:1 to about 1.2:1. Alternatively, the ratio of the number of stoichiometric epoxy groups in the at least one polyalkylene polyether polyol modified polyepoxide resin to the number of moles of the at least one alkylated polyalkyleneamine is in a range from about 0.5:1 to about 1.1:1. In a further aspect, the ratio is in a range from about 0.7:1 to about 1.1:1, or from about 0.9:1 to about 1.1:1.<br>
[0023]    In accordance with the present invention, a method of making a curing agent composition is provided. This method comprises adding one of at least one polyalkylene polyether polyol modified polyepoxide resin and at least one alkylated polyalkyleneamine compound to the other, which can be done in a reactor, vessel, or other container. One component, e.g., the polyepoxide resin, is added to the other slowly, over a time period generally from about 1 to about 3 hours. The reaction temperature can be between about 50°C and about 150°C. Reaction temperature can be maintained substantially constant during the addition process. In another aspect, the reaction temperature can be<br><br>
between about 70°C and about 85°C. The reaction can cause an exothem, raising the temperature above the set point. After the addition step is complete, the temperature can be changed. The temperature after the addition step is between about 50°C and about 150°C. Alternatively, the temperature at this stage can be between about 100°C and about 130°C. The reaction can be allowed to continue for approximately another 30 minutes to about 2 hours to provide for a substantially complete reaction. Non-iimiting examples of the synthesis of curing agent compositions in accordance with the present invention are illustrated in Examples 14-28 that follow.<br>
[0024]    In preparing the reaction product, the curing agent composition can become very viscous, and in such cases, a solvent can be added to the reactor. Exemplary solvents include, but are not limited to, n-butanol, toluene, xylene, and the like, or mixtures thereof.   The solvent can be removed via distillation after the reaction is complete, and optionally replaced with water to keep the viscosity low or to form an aqueous curing agent composition.<br>
[0025]    In another aspect of the invention, before the reaction product cools, at least one multifunctional amine is added to lower the viscosity and to target a desired AHEW<br>
for the curing agent composition. Optionally, water is added to reach a desired percent solids content for such aqueous curing agent composition.<br>
[0026]    Further, it can be beneficial for the aqueous curing agent compositions of the present invention to form single phase systems after dilution with water. For example, the present invention provides for an aqueous composition at about 20*^0, V\^herein the curing agent composition is diluted vv'ith water to less than 40% solids to form a single phase aqueous curing agent composition. The aqueous curing agent composition is substantially free of co-solvents. Substantially free of co-solvents means that less than 1 % by weight of a solvent or diluent other than v^iaXer (e.g., an acid or organic solvent) is present in the aqueous curing agent formulation. Acids can be used to protonate amine groups and thereby increase the solubility of the curing agent composition in water. Additionally, these single phase waterborne compositions or formulations are substantially clear to the naked eye. In another aspect, a single phase aqueous curing agent composition can be formed under the same conditions discussed above after dilution with water to less than 20% solids. In a further aspect, a single phase aqueous composition can be formed at about 20°C, and substantially free of co-solvents, after dilution with water to less than 10% solids.<br><br>
[0027]   Aqueous curing agent compositions described herein can maintain single phase   uniformity for extended periods of time, which can be required for storage of the product and its subsequent use in its intended application. Additionally, if these compositions are substantially free of co-solvents, they can have substantially no VOC's, which can be beneficial for environmental, health and safety issues, as will be appreciated by those skilled in the art.<br>
[0028]   The water-based curing agent compositions also can be further modified with monofunctional epoxides, such as, for example, phenylglycidylether, o-cresylglycidytethers, p-tert-buty!phenylglycidylethers, n-butyiglycidylethers, and other similar glycidylethers or esters. Optionally, the curing agent compositions of the present can further comprise organic acids, such as acetic acid, sulfamic acid, lactic acid, salicylic acid, and sebacic acid; or inorganic acids, such as boric acid and phosphoric acid; or combinations thereof. Addition of the acid functionality can increase the solubility of the curing agent composition in water. Further, curing agent compositions disclosed herein can be blended with other commercially available curing agents. Such commercially available curing agents include, but are not limited to, water-based curing agents, which can be employed in a blend to target specific properties, such as cure rate, drying speed, hardness development, clarity, and gloss.<br>
[0029]   The present invention, in yet another aspect, provides amine-epoxy compositions. For example, an amine-epoxy composition in accordance with the present invention comprises the reaction product of:<br>
A)	a curing agent composition comprising the contact product of:<br>
(i)        the reaction product of:<br>
(a)	at least one alkylated polyalkyleneamine and<br>
(b)	at least one polyalkylene polyether polyol modified polyepoxide resin; and<br>
(ii)        at least one multifunctional amine having 2 or more active amine hydrogens; and<br>
B)	an epoxy composition comprising at least one multifunctional epoxy resin.<br>
[003Q]    Further, in another aspect of the present invention, aqueous amine-epoxy compositions comprising the amine-epoxy composition described immediately above and water are provided. These novel waterborne amine-epoxy compositions have good<br><br>
stability when in contact with concrete or cementitious materials and high gloss and good hardness development when in the form of a film or coating.<br>
[0031]   The present invention also includes articles of manufacture comprising an amine-epoxy composition as described above. Such articles can include, but are not limited to, an adhesive, a coating, a primer, a sealant, a curing compound, a construction product, a flooring product, or a composite product. Additional components or additives can be used together with the compositions of the present invention to produce articles of manufacture. Further, such coatings, primers, sealants, or curing compounds can be applied to metal or cementitious substrates.<br>
[0032]   The relative amount chosen for the epoxy composition versus that of the curing agent composition, or hardener, can vary depending upon, for example, the end-use article, its desired properties, and the fabrication method and conditions used to produce the end-use article. For instance, in coating applications using certain amine-epoxy compositions, incorporating more epoxy resin relative to the amount of the curing agent composition can result in coatings which have increased drying time, but with increased hardness and improved appearance as measured by gloss, Amine-epoxy compositions of the present invention generally have stoichiometric ratios of epoxy groups in the epoxy composition to amine hydrogens in the curing agent composition ranging from about 1.5:1 to about 0.7:1. For example, such amine-epoxy compositions can have stoichiometric ratios of about 1.5:1, about 1.4:1, about 1.3:1, about 1.2:1, about 1.1:1, about 1:1, about 0.9:1, about 0.8:1, or about 0.7:1. In another aspect, the stoichiometric ratio ranges from about 1.3:1 to about 0.7:1. In yet another aspect, the stoichiometric ratio ranges from about 1.2:1 to about 0.8:1. In still another aspect, the stoichiometric ratio ranges from about 1.1:1 to about 0.9:1. Non-limiting examples of waterborne amine-epoxy compositions in accordance with the present invention are illustrated in Examples 29-52 that follow.<br>
[0033]   Applicants disclose several types of ranges in the present invention. These include, but are not limited to, a range of AHEW, a range of number of carbon atoms, a ranoe of inteoers. and a ranoe of reactant ratios and stoichiometric ratios. When Applicants disclose or claim a range of any type, Applicants' intent is to disclose or claim individually each possible number that such a range could reasonably encompass, as well as any sub-ranges and combinations of sub-ranges encompassed therein. For example, when the Applicants disclose or claim a chemical moiety having a certain<br><br>
number of carbon atoms, Applicants' intent is to disclose or claim individually every possible number that such a range could encompass, consistent with the disclosure herein. For example, the disclosure that "R1" can be a C1 to C16 alkyl group, or in alternative language having from 1 to 16 carbon atoms, as used herein, refers to a "R^" group that can be selected independently from an alkyl group having 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, or 16 carbon atoms, as well as any range between these two numbers (for example, a Ceto C13 alkyl group), and also including any combination of ranges between these two numbers (for example, a C2 to C4 and Ce to Ca alkyl group).<br>
[0034]   Similarly, another representative example follows for the reactant ratio of the number of stoichiometric epoxy groups in the at least one polyalkylene polyether polyol modified poiyepoxide resin to the number of moles of the at least one alkylated polyalkyieneamine. By a disclosure that this ratio is in a range from about 0.2:1 to about 1.3:1, for example. Applicants intend to recite that the ratio can be selected from about 0.2:1, about 0.3:1, about 0.4:1, about 0.5:1, about 0.6:1, about 0.7:1, about 0.8:1, about 0.9:1, about 1:1, about 1.1:1, about 1.2:1, or about 1.3:1. Likewise, all other ranges disclosed herein should be interpreted in a manner similar to these two examples.<br>
[0035]    Applicants reserve the right to proviso out or exclude any individual memibers of any such group, including any sub-ranges or combinations of sub-ranges within the group, that can be claimed according to a range or in any similar manner, if for any reason Applicants choose to claim less than the full measure of the disclosure, for example, to account for a reference that Applicants may be unaware of at the time of the filing of the application. Further, Applicants reserve the right to proviso out or exclude any individual substituents, analogs, compounds, ligands, structures, or groups thereof, or any members of a claimed group, if for any reason Applicants choose to claim less than the full measure of the disclosure, for example, to account for a reference that Applicants may be unaware of at the time of the filing of the application.<br>
[0036]    The term "contact product" is used herein to describe compositions wherein the components are contacted together in any order, in any manner, and for any length of time. For example, the components can be contacted by blending or mixing. Further, contacting of any component can occur in the presence or absence of any other component of the compositions or formulations described herein. Combining additional matehals or components can be done by any method known to one of skill in the art.<br><br>
[0037]   While compositions and methods are described in terms of "comprising" various components or steps, the compositions and methods can also "consist essentially of or "consist of the various components or steps.<br>
ALKYLATED POLYALKYLENEAMINE<br>
[0038]    Poiyalkyleneamine compounds that are useful in producing the alkylated polyalkyleneamine compounds of the present invention include, but are not limited to, polyethyleneamines, polypropyleneamines, aminopropylated ethyienediamines, aminopropyiated propylenediamines, and combinations thereof. Non-limiting examples of polyethyleneamines include ethylenediamine (EDA), diethylenetriamine (DETA), triethylenetetramine (TETA), teraethylenepentamine (TEPA), pentaethylenehexamine (PEHA), and other higher polyethyleneamines.

In a further aspect, the molar reactant ratio of the at least one aldehyde or ketone compound to the at least one polyalkyleneamine compound is in a range from about 1.2:1 to about 1.5:1.<br>
[0048]    The alkylated polyalkyleneamines of the present invention can be prepared by the reductive amination of at least one polyalkyleneamine compound v^^ith the at least one aldehyde or ketone compounds disclosed above. Procedures for the reductive amination of aldehyde and ketone compounds are well known to those of skill in the art. Generally, these procedures involve condensing the aldehyde or ketone with the amine, then reducing the intermediate Schiff base. The reduction is typically conducted in the presence of a metal catalyst in a hydrogen-rich atmosphere at pressures above atmospheric pressure. Non-limiting examples of the synthesis of alkylated polyalkyleneamines in accordance with the present invention are illustrated in Examples 1-11 that follow.<br><br><br>
[0051]    Halogen compounds useful in the present invention include, but are not limited to. iodomethane, bromoethane, 1-chioropropane, 1-chlorobutane, 1-chloro-2-methylpropane, benzyl chloride, 2-chloroethylben2ene, and the like, or any combination thereof, in a further aspect of the present invention, the at least one halogen compound is benzyl chloride.<br>
[0052]    As discussed above, the alkylated polyalkyleneamines of the present invention can be prepared by the reaction of at least one polyalkyleneamine compound with at least one halogen compound. A non-limiting example of the synthesis of alkylated polyalkyleneamines which can be employed in the present invention is illustrated in Publication IN166475. According to Publication 1N166475, benzyl chloride (3.627 L, 31.78 moles), a halogen compound, was added in small portions to a cooled solution of anhydrous ethylenediamine (11.160 L, 167.77 moles), a polyalkyleneamine compound, in absolute ethanol. This addition occurred in a 50-L all glass lined M.S. jacketed reactor provided with an anchor type agitator, reflux condenser, a side distillation condenser, sight and light glass, thermometer pocket, outlet for gas through reflux condenser, inlet hole for charging, and bottom discharge valve. The reaction mixture was refiuxed for 18 hours. Thereafter, the solution was cooled, and the excess of ethylenediamine was recovered and basified by adding sodium hydroxide. The oil separated was extracted with benzene several times, combined extracts were dried (Na2S04) and solvent was removed. The oil obtained was distilled under reduced pressure. This exemplary synthesis of an alkylated polyalkyleneamine utilized a large molar excess of ethylenediamine. A large molar excess of one reactant is not required, but may be employed, in the practice of this invention. Generally, molar reactant ratios of the at least one halogen compound to the at least one polyalkyleneamine compound are within a range from about 0.8:1 to about 2:1. In another aspect, the molar reactant ratio is about 0.9:1, about 1:1, about 1.1:1, about 1.2:1, about 1.3:1, about 1.4:1, about 1.5:1, about 1.6:1, about 1.7:1, about 1.8:1, or about 1.9:1. Yet, in another aspect, the molar reactant ratio of the at least one halogen compound to the at least one polyalkyleneamine compound is in a range from about 1.2:1 to about 1.5:1. Additionally, those of ordinary skill in the art in the field of this invention readily recognize that other polyalkyleneamines and halogen compounds, respectively, can be substituted into this genera! reaction scheme under like conditions and produce additional alkylated polyalkyleneamine compounds.<br><br><br>
[0054]   Those of skill in the art will recognize that the backbones of these two structures a^e poiyethyleneamines and aminopropylated ethylenediamines, respectively. For example, when n equals 2, the structure backbone is TETA. Likewise, when p and q are both equal to 1. the structure backbone is N4. As another example, when the at least one ketone or aldehyde compound is benzaldehyde or the at least one halogen compound is benzyl chloride, RA is a benzyl group. Given the many possible locations on the polyalkyleneamine compound where the benzyl group can replace a hydrogen<br><br>
atom, the product resulting from the reaction of at least one polyalkyieneamine compound and benzaldehyde or benzyl chloride is neoessarity a mixture of many different species, where some of the RB, RC, RD RE, RF, and RG groups are hydrogen and others are benzyl groups. Which and how many of the "R" groups are converted from hydrogen to benzyl groups depends on many factors, among those being the reaction conditions, catalyst selection, reactant ratio, choice of reactant (specific halogen compound, aldehyde/ketone compound), and the like.<br>
[0055]   While not intending to be bound by this theory, Applicant's believe that one hydrogen on each terminal nitrogen on the least one polyalkyieneamine compound is preferentially replaced by the benzyl group, in this example using benzaldehyde as the aldehyde/ketone reactant. With a moiar reactant ratio of benzaldehyde to the at least one polyalkyieneamine compound of between about 1:1 to about 2:1, it is believed that the major component of the reaction product is where RA is benzyl, RD is benzyl or a hydrogen atom, and R^, R^, R^, R^, and R^ are hydrogen atoms.<br>

MULTIFUNCTIONAL EPOXY RESIN<br>
[0074]   Amine-epoxy compositions of the present invention comprise the reaction product of a curing agent composition and an epoxy composition comprising at least one<br><br>
multifunctional epoxy resin. Multifunctional epoxy resin, as used herein, describes compounds containing 2 or more 1,2-epoxy groups per molecule. Epoxide compounds of this type are well known to those of skill in the art and are described in Y. Tanaka, "Synthesis and Characteristics of Epoxides", in C. A. May, ed., Epoxy Resins Chemistry and Technology (Marcel Dekker, 1988), which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
[0075]    One class of epoxy resins suitable for use in the present invention comprises the glycidyl ethers of polyhydric phenols, including the glycidyl ethers of dihydric phenols. Illustrative examples include, but are not limited to, the glycidyl ethers of resorcinol, hydroquinone, bis-(4-hydroxy-3,5-difluorophenyl)-methane, 1,1 -bis-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-ethane, 2,2-b!S-(4-hydroxy-3-methylphenyl)-propane, 2,2-bis-(4-hydroxy-3,5-dichlorophenyl) propane, 2,2-bis-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-propane (commercially known as bisphenol A), bis-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-methane (commercially known as bisphenol F, and which may contain varying amounts of 2-hydroxyphenyl isomers), and the like, or any combination thereof. Additionally, advanced dihydric phenols of the following structure also are useful in the present invention:<br><br>
where m is an integer, and R is a divalent hydrocarbon radical of a dihydric phenol, such as those dihydric phenols listed above. Materials according to this formula can be prepared by polymerizing mixtures of a dihydric phenol and epichlorohydrin, or by advancing a mixture of a diglycidyl ether of the dihydhc phenol and the dihydhc phenol. While in any given molecule the value of m is an integer, the materials are invariably mixtures which can be characterized by an average value of m vv^hich is not necessanly a whole number. Polymeric materials with an average value of m between 0 and about 7 can be used in one aspect of the present invention.<br>
[0076]    in another aspect, epoxy novolac resins, which are the glycidyl ethers of novolac resins, can be used as multifunctional epoxy resins in accordance v/iih the present invention, in yet another aspect, the at least one multifunctional epoxy resin is a diglycidyl ether of bisphenol-A (DGEBA), an advanced or higher molecular weight version of DGEBA, a diglycidyl ether of bisphenol-F, an epoxy novolac resin, or any<br><br>

Higher molecular weight versions or derivatives of DGEBA are prepared by the advancement process, where excess DGEBA is reacted with bisphenol-A to yield epoxy terminated products. The epoxy equivalent weights (EEW) for such products ranges from about 450 to 3000 or more. Because these products are solid at room temperature, they are often referred to as solid epoxy resins.<br>
[0077]    DGEBA or advanced DGEBA resins are often used in coating formulations due to a combination of their low cost and generally high performance properties. Commercial grades of DGEBA having an EEW ranging from about 174 to about 250, and more commonly from about 185 to about 195, are readily available. At these low molecular weights, the epoxy resins are liquids and are often referred to as liquid epoxy resins. It is understood by those skilled in the art that most grades of liquid epoxy resin are slightly polymeric, since pure DGEBA has an EEW of 174. Resins with EEW's between 250 and 450, also generally prepared by the advancement process, are referred to as semi-solid epoxy resins because they are a mixture of solid and liquid at room temperature. Generally, multifunctional resins with EEW's based on solids of about 150 to about 750 are useful in the prevent invention, in another aspect the multifunctional epoxy resin has an EEW in a range from about 170 to about 250.<br>
[0078]    Depending upon the end-use application, it can be beneficial to reduce the viscosity of the compositions of the present invention by modifying the epoxy component. For example, the viscosity can be reduced to allow an increase in the level of pigment in a formulation or composition while still permitting easy application, or to allow the use of a higher molecular weight epoxy resin. Thus, it is within the scope of the present invention for the epoxy component, which comprises at least one multifunctional epoxy resin, to further comprise a monofunctional epoxide. Examples of monoepoxides include, but are not limited to, styrene oxide, cyclohexene oxide, ethylene oxide, propylene oxide, butylene oxide, and the glycidyl ethers of phenol, cresols, tert-butylphenol, other alkyl phenols, butanol, 2-ethylhexanol, C4 to C14 alcohols, and the like, or combinations thereof. The multifunctional epoxy resin can also be present in a solution or emulsion, with the diluent being water, an organic solvent, or a mixture thereof.<br><br>

EXAMPLE 1<br>
Synthesis of benz^dated ethylenediamine (EDA) at a 1,1:1 molar ratio<br>
[008S]    180.3 g of EDA (3.0 moles) and 2.7 g of Pd/C catalyst were placed in a 1-liter autoclave batch reactor. The reactor was sealed and subsequently purged with nitrogen and then with hydrogen to remove any air from the reactor. Over a time period of about 15 to 20 minutes, 350.1 g of benzaidehyde (3.3 moles) were added to the reactor.   After the addition of the benzaidehyde was complete, the reactor contents were stirred for an additional 15 minutes or until the reaction was complete, at which time the reaction exotherm began to subside. At this point, the reactor was pressurized to 120 psi with hydrogen and the reactor was heated to 80°C. When the rate of hydrogen uptake slowed, the pressure was increased to 800 psi and the temperature was increased to 120°C. The hydrogenation process continued until the rate of hydrogen uptake fell below 0.0034 MPa/min (0.5 psi/min). The total hydrogenation time was about 5 hours. The reactor was cooled to 60°C and depressurized, and the reaction product y^as filtered to remove the catalyst. Water was removed using a rotary-evaporator operating under 20 mm Hg vacuum and temperatures up to 120°C. The resulting reaction product was benzylated EDA, with viscosity, AHEW, theoretical amine value, and actual (measured) amine value properties as shown in Table 1.<br><br>

[0087]    397.2 g of DETA (3.78 moles) and 6 g of Pd/C catalyst were placed in a Miter autoclave batch reactor. The reactor was sealed and subsequently purged with nitrogen and then with hydrogen to remove any air from the reactor. Over a time period of about 15 to 20 minutes, 268.3 g of acetone (4.63 moles) were added to the reactor.   After the addition of the acetone was complete, the reactor contents were stirred for an additional 15 minutes or until the reaction was complete, at which time the reaction exotherm began to subside. At this point, the reactor was pressurized to 120 psi with hydrogen and the reactor was heated to 80°C. When the rate of hydrogen uptake slowed, the pressure was increased to 800 psi and the temperature was increased to 120°C. The hydrogenation process continued until the rate of hydrogen uptake fell below 0.0034 MPa/min (0.5 psi/min). The total hydrogenation time was about 5 hours. The reactor was cooled to 60°C and depressurized, and the reaction product was filtered to remove the catalyst. Water was removed using a rotary-evaporator operating under 20 mm Hg vacuum and temperatures up to 120°C. The resulting reaction product was alkylated DETA. with viscosity, AHEW, theoretical amine vaiue, and actual (measured) amine value properties as show'n in Table 1.<br>

[0091]    Example 11 utilized the same process as described in Example 1. The N4 mixture is a composition comprising 5-8 parts of N3, 82-88 parts of N4, 5-8 parts of N5. and 1.5-4 parts of other materials. The ratio of the moles of benzaldehyde to the total moles of amine was 1.2:1. Table 1 lists the viscosity, AHEW, theoretical amine value, and actual (measured) amine value properties of the benzylated N4 mixture reaction product of Example 11.<br><br><br><br><br>
EXAMPLE 12<br>
Synthesis of polyalkylene polyetherpolyol modified polyepoxide Resin A<br>
[0092]    379 g of polyethylene glycol 1000 (0.758 equivalents OH) and 490 g of a bisphenol-A diglycicyi ether having an epoxy equivalent weight of 190 (2.58 equivealents epoxy) were charged to a stirred reactor equipped with a thermocouple and a reflux condenser. The ratio of epoxy groups or epoxy equivalents in the polyepoxide compound to hydroxyl groups in the potyol was 3.4:1. 3 grams of a BFs-amine catalyst, commercially available from Air Products and Chemicals, Inc., as Anchor® 1040, were then added to the reactor. While the reactor contents were stirred, the reactor temperature was increased to 170°C. This temperature was maintained until the epoxy equivalent vv^eight increased to about 475 to 500. The reactor contents were then cooled, resulting in a reaction product designated as Resin A. The epoxy equivalent weight of Resin A was 498 and the viscosity at 40°C v^^as 33 Poise (3.3 Pa-s).<br>
EXAMPLE 13<br>
Syntiiesis of polyalkylene polyetherpolyol modified polyepoxide Resin B<br>
[00S3]    Example 13 utilized the same process as described in Example 12. The reactants were 3043.8 g of polyethylene glycol 2000 (3.04 equivalents OH) and 1144.6 g of a bisphenol-A digiycidyl ether having an epoxy equivalent weight of 190 (6.09 equivalents epoxy). The ratio of epoxy groups or epoxy equivalents in the polyepoxide<br><br>
compound to hydroxyl groups in the potyoi was 2:1. After following the process of Example 12, the final product was designated as Resin B. The epoxy equivalent weight of Resin B was 1392 and the viscosity at 70°C was 668 mPaS. Viscosity was determined using a Brookfield DV-II+ cone and ptate viscometer, CP52 spindle, 100 rpm. Using Gei'Permeation Chromatography (GPC), THF solvent, and polystyrene calibration standards, the Mn (number-average molecular weight) was 4017, and the Mw (weight average molecular weight) was 7866. Low molecular weight unreacted epoxy resin was excluded from molecular weight distribution and from the determination of Mn and M^.<br>
EXAMPLES 14-20<br>
Preparation of curing agent compositions using a 2-step process<br>
[0094]    In the 2-step process, the stoichiomethc amount of at least one alkylated polyalkyleneamine required to react with the at least one polyalkylene polyetherpolyol modified polyepoxide resin is charged to the reactor initially, then the epoxide resin is added to commence the reaction. Once the reaction is complete, at least one multifunctional amine (i.e., free amine) can be added to the reaction product followed by dilution of the product with water and stirring for 15 minutes to ensure consistency.<br>
[0095]    In step 1 of Example 14, 67.2 g (0.04 moles) of benzylated EDA (1.2:1 degree of benzylation) were placed in a 1-liter glass reactor fitted with a glass stirrer, a thermocouple and a 250-ml dropping funnel. The benzylated EDA was heated to 82°G and maintained at that temperature. 200 g (0.2 moles) of Resin A (see Example 12) were pre-heated to 80°C and charged to the dropping funnel. Resin A was then added slowly from the funnel to the benzylated amine in the reactor over about 2 hours. The reactor contents were stirred continuously at 320-360 rpm to ensure uniform dispersion of Resin A in the benzylated amine. A slight exotherm was observed that brought the temperature up to about 84°C. After the addition of Resin A was complete, the temperature was increased to 120°C and maintained for 1 hour. The resulting product was a curing agent composition comprising the reaction product of at least one alkylated polyalkyleneamine and at least one polyalkylene polyetherpolyol modified polyepoxide resin. The reaction product had a measured amine value of 156.3 mg KOH^g and an AHEW of 371. The viscosity at 25°C could not be accurately determined due to the semi-solid nature of the reaction product composition.<br><br>
[0096]    In step 2 of Example 14, 72.1 g (0.43 moles) of a multifunctional amine, benzyiated EDA in this example,, were added over a time period of 15 minutes to the reaction product composition of step 1. Then, 339.3 g of water were added to bring the solids content of this final product to 50%. This final product had an amine value of 136 mg KOH/g, a viscosity at 25^'C of 37500 mPa*s, and an AHEVV of 353. Table 2 summarizes the quantities of each reactant and the additional components, as well as the analytical test results on the final product.<br>
[0097]    Examples 15-20 utilized the same process as described in Example 14. As illustrated in Table 2, Examples 15 and 16 utilized benzyiated DETA and benzyiated TETA, respectively, as the at least one alkylated polyalkyleneamine in step 1, the reaction with Resin A, and as the multifunctional amine (or free amine) in step 2. Examples 17-20 used benzyiated DETA/TETA mixtures as the at least one alkylated polyalkyleneamine and as the multifunctional amine (or free amine). Example 17 used a 50/50 weight ratio of DETAyTETA and Examples 18-20 used a 70/30 weight ratio of DETA/TETA.<br>
COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE 21<br>
Preparation of a curing agent composition using a Z-step process, absent the alkylated polyalkyleneamine<br>
[0098]    Comparative Example 21 utilized a 70/30 weight ratio of DETA/TETA as the polyalkyleneamine component, but the polyalkyleneamine component was not alkylated, i.e., not reacted with at least one halogen compound or at least one aldehyde or ketone compound, such as, for example, acetone or benzaldehyde.<br>
EXAMPLES 22-23<br>
Preparation of curing agent compositions using a 1-step process<br>
[0099]    In the 1-step process, all of the at least one alkylated polyalkyleneamine is chaf-ged to reactor. No additional multifunctional amine or free amine is subsequently added. The at least one alkylated polyalkyleneamine is reacted with the at least one polyalkylene polyetherpolyol modified polyepoxide resin. Once the reaction is complete, the reaction product can be diluted with water and stirred for 15 minutes to ensure consistency.<br><br>
[0100]    In Example 22, 262.3 g (1.1 moles) of benzylated DETA (1.5:1 degree of benzylation) were placed in a 2-iiter glass reactor fitted with a glass stirrer, a thermocouple, connected to a control, and a 500-ml dropping funnel. The benzylated DETA was heated to 82°C and maintained at that temperature. 300 g (0.3 moles) of Resin A (see Example 12) were pre-heated to 80°C and charged to the dropping funnel. Resin A was then added slowly from the funnel to the benzylated amine in the reactor over about 2 hours. The reactor contents were stirred continuously at 320-360 rpm to ensure uniform dispersion of Resin A in the benzylated amine. A slight exotherm was observed that brought the temperature up to about 84°C. After the addition of Resin A was complete, the temperature was increased to 120°C and maintained for 1 hour. The resulting product was a curing agent composition comprising the reaction product of at least one alkylated polyalkyleneamine and at least one polyalkylene polyetherpolyol modified polyepoxide resin.<br>
[0101]   This reaction product was cooled down to about 100°C, and 562.3 g of water were added to bring the solids content of the final product to 50%. This final product had an amine value of 162 mg KOH/g, a viscosity at 25°C of 4968 mPa»s, and an ANEW of 347.  Example 23 utilized the same process as described in Example 22, but the<br>
benzylated DETA had a 2:1 degree of benzylation. Table 2 summarizes Examples 22-23.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
EXAMPLES 24-28<br>
Preparation of curing agent compositions comprising a benzylated N4 mixture<br>
[0102]    In Example 24, 12.64 g (0.0455 moles) of benzylated N4 mixture (1.2:1 degree of benzylation) were placed in a 100-mL glass reactor fitted with a glass stirrer, a thermocouple and a 25-ml dropping funnel. The benzylated amine mixture was heated to 82'C and maintained at that temperature. 12.02 g (0.0043 moles) of Resin B (see Example 13) were pre-heated to 80°C and charged to the dropping funnel. Resin B was then added slowly from the funnel to the benzylated amine in the reactor over about 25 minutes. The reactor contents were stirred continuously at 300 rpm to ensure uniform dispersion of Resin B in the benzylated amine. No exotherm was observed. 18.2 g (0.0182 moles) of Resin A (see Example 12) were pre-heated to 80°C and charged to the dropping funnel. Resin A was then added siowty from the funnel to the reactor<br><br>
contents over 90 minutes. The reactor contents were stirred continuously at 300 rpm to ensure uniform dispersion of Resin A in the reaction mixture. A slight exotherm was observed that brought the temperature up to about 87-88°C. After the addition of Resin A was complete, the temperature was increased to 120°C and maintained for 1 hour. The resulting product was a curing agent composition comprising the reaction product of at least one alkylated polyalkyieneamine and at least one polyalkylene polyetherpolyol modified polyepoxide resin.<br>
[0103]    6.32 g (0.0227 moles) of a multifunctional amine, benzylated N4 in this example, were then added over a time period of 15 minutes to the reaction product. Water was subsequently added to bring the solids content of this final product to 50%. This final product had an amine value of 149.8 mg KOH/g, a viscosity at 25°C of 13150 mPa.s, and an AHEV\/ of 349. Table 3 summarizes the quantities of each reactant and additional components, as well as the analytical results of the final product.<br>
[0104]    Examples 25-27 utilized the same process as described in Example 24, except as follows. Example 26 used a combination of benzylated N4 and benzylated DETA/TETA as the initial charge to the reactor, as indicated in Table 3. After the reaction vv'ith Resin B and Resin A was complete. 3.31 g (0.0119 moles) of a multifunctiona! amine, the benzylated N4 mixture, were then added over a time period of 15 minutes to the reaction product. Then, 2.79 g (0.012 moles) of benzyiated DETA/TETA were added over a time period of 15 minutes. Water was subsequently added to bring the solids content of this final product to 50%. Example 27 also used a combination of benzylated N4 and benzylated DETAyTETA as the initial charge to the reactor, as indicated in Table 3. After the reaction with Resin B and Resin A was complete, however, only one of the two benzylated amines, benzylated N4, was added prior to the dilution with water to a solids content of 50%.<br>
[0105]    Example 28 utilized the same process as described in Example 14 and is summarized in Table 3. After Resin A was added to the benzylated N4 mixture, a slight exotherm vv'as observed that brought the temperature from BO°C up to about 82-83°C.<br><br><br><br>
EXAMPLES 29-39<br>
Coatings prepared from waterborne amine-epoxy compositions<br>
[0106]   Table 4 summarizes the waterborne amine-epoxy cornpositions at 40% solids used in Examples 29-39. For instance, the composition of Example 29 was 35.7 g of water, 19 g of Epikote 828 epoxy resin, and 28.8 g of .the curing agent composition of Example 15. As indicated in Table 2, Example 15 was a curing agent composition comprising the reaction product of at (east one alkylated polyaikyleneamine (benzylated DETA) and at least one polyalkylene polyetherpolyol modified polyepoxide resin (Resin A) which was diluted to 50% solids. The curing agents and their respective quantities shown in examples 29-39 were used after dilution to 50% solids. Comparative Examples 37-39 used commercially available amine-based curing agent compositions. An attempt was made to produce a waterborne amine-epoxy composition using the non-a(kylated DETATETA curing agent composition of comparative Example 21. While this material produced a formulation that was soluble in water, it could not emulsify the epoxy resin.<br>
[0107]    Drying times for the compositions are summarized in Table 5. The drying time was determined at 23°C and 65% relative humidity (RH) using a Beck-Koiier recorder, in accordance with ASTM D5895, phase 3. The procedure involved coating glass panels with the amine-epoxy compositions at approxim.atefy 6 miis wet film thickness at the timie intervals indicated in the Table 5. The selection of a coating composition with either a long or short drying time depends upon the requirements of the end-use application. Gene:'ally, the results in Table 5 indicated that the coatings of inventive Examples 29-36 dry faster as they progress into the pot-life. Some of these examples had drying times in excess of 6 hours at the 10-minute time period but had drying times of less than 2 hours at the 240-minute time period.<br>
[0108]    Tables 6A, 6B, and 6C list the Persoz Hardness test results after 1 day, 3 days, and 7 days, respectively, at 23'C and 50% RH. Coatings were applied to glass panels at a wet film thickness of about 8 miis and tested in accordance with ISO 1522. Pot life was determined at 23°C and 65% RH by coating glass panels at regular intervals of time using a 10-mil square applicator. The end of the pot-life, as indicated by "END" in the tables, was taken as the time at which there Vv'as a reduction in the film or coating gloss. As shov^n in Table 6A, each of the formulations of inventive Examples 29-36 had a miuch longer pot-life than the formulations of comparative Examples 38-39. some as long as 6 hours or more.<br><br>
[0109]    Additionally, the coatings of inventive Examples 29-36 had much faster hardness development than the coating of comparative Example 37. The coatings of inventive Examples 29-35 also provided higher ultimate hardness than the coatings of either comparative Example 37 or 38. Tables 6B and SC illustrate a beneficial combination of properties provided by coatings of the present invention, that is, generally long pot-life and stable and consistent hardness over the pot-life of the amine-epoxy composition or formulation.<br>
[0110]   Tables 7A, 7B, and 7C list the 20° Gloss test results after 1 day, 3 days, and 7 days, respectively, at 23°C and 50% RH. Results shown are the average of 10 measurements. Coatings were applied to glass panels at a wet film thickness of about 8 mils and tested in accordance with ASTM D523. The gloss was measured at an angle of 20° using a Gardner gloss meter. Measurements were made with the glass panel placed on a black cardboard background. As shown in Table 7A, each of the formulations of inventive Examples 29-36 had a much longer pot-life than the formulations of comparative Examples 38-39. In addition, the coatings of inventive Examples 29-36 generally had higher gloss than the coating of Example 39 and comparable to that of Example 33.  In comparison to the coating of Example 37, coatings of inventive Examples 23-36 had significantly higher gloss results. Tables 7B and 7C illustrate the stability over time of the high gloss levels of the coatings of inventive Examples 29-35.<br>
[0111]   Table 8 summarizes the forward and reverse impact test results for 8-mil wet film coatings at 23°C and 50% RH. The forward and reverse impact results are shown in kg-cm and were determined using the falling ball method for rapid deformation in accordance with ASTM D2794-93. Higher impact test results generally correlate v^ith improved flexibility and resilience of the coating. As illustrated in Table 8, the coatings of inventive Examples 29-36 generally have higher forward and reverse impact results than the coatings of Examples 37-39. In some cases, such as Examples 31, 34, and 36, the impact results are significantly better than coatings made from formulations using commercially available curing agents. Thus, the coatings of Examples 31, 34, and 36 would be expected to have superior flexibility to those of the Examples 37-39. Further, the coating of Example 36 not only provides very high impact results, but also impact results that are consistent and do not decrease over time.<br>
[0112]    Examples 32 and 33 illustrate the reproducibility of producing amine-epoxy compositions and the resultant drying time, hardness, gioss, and flexibility properties<br><br>
(refer to Tables 2 and 4-8). The amine curing agent used in both Example 32 and Example 33 comprised benzyiated DETA/TETA with a 70/30 ratio of DETATETA.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
EXAMPLES 40-44<br>
Coatings prepared from waterborne amine-epoxy compositions wherein the amine component comprises a benzylated N4 mixture<br>
[0113]   Table 9 summarizes the waterborne amine-epoxy compositions at 40% solids used in Examples 40-44.  For instance, the composition of Example 40 was 40.8 g of water, 20.8 g of Epil\ote 828 epoxy resin, and 38.4 g of the curing agent coniposition of Example 24. As indicated in Table 3, Example 24 was a curing agent composition comprising the reaction product of at least one alkylated potyalkyieneamine (benzylated N4) and at least one polyalkylene polyetherpolyol modified poiyepoxide resin (Resin A and Resin B) which was diluted to 50% solids. The curing agents and their respective quantities shown in examples 40-44 were used after dilution to 50% solids.<br>
[0114]   The viscosity measurements in Table 10 were taken at 25°C and measured in mPa.s. These results indicate that these amine-epoxy formulations having an amine component that comprises or is based on Benzylated N4 have a short pot-life.<br>
[0115]    Drying times, Perscz hardness, and gloss were determined in the manner described above in reference to Examples 29-39. The results in Table 11 for inventive Examples 40-44 show generally faster coating drying times, in comparison to the coatings of inventive Examples 29-36 in Table 5.<br>
[0115]   Table 12 lists the Persoz Hardness test results after 1 day, 3 days, and 7 days. The coatings of Examples 40-43 had slower hardness development, and lower ultimate hardness, than the coatings of Examptes 29-36, referring to Tables 6A, 6B, and 6C. As shown in Table 12, the coating of Example 44 had high ultimate hardness and stable and consistent hardness, similar to that exemplified in Examples 29-35.<br>
[0117]   Table 13 lists the 20" Gloss test results after 1 day, 3 days, and 7 days. As show^n in Table 13, each of the coatings of inventive Examples 40-44 generally had higher gloss than the coatings of Examples 37 and 39, and comparable gloss to the coatings of inventive Examples 29-36 and comparative Example 38. The gloss data for Examples 29-39 is shov^^n in Tables 7A, 78, and 7C.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
EXAMPLES 45-52<br>
Cement stability testing of waterborne amine-epoxy compositions<br>
[011S]   Table 14 summarizes the waterborne amine-epoxy compositions at 10% solids used in Examples 45-52. For instance, the composition of Example 45 was 85.2 g of water, 5.2 g of Epikote 823 epoxy resin, and 9.6 g of the curing agent composition of Example 14. As indicated in Table 2, Example 14 was a curing agent composition comprising the reaction product of at least one alkylated polyalkyleneamine (benzylated EDA) and at least one potyalkylene polyetherpoiyol modified potyepoxide resin (Resin A) which was diluted to 50% solids.<br>
[0119]    Cement stability testing was conducted by mixing the amine-based curing agent, epoxy resin, and water to achieve 10% solids, as indicated in Table 14. To 50 g of the diluted amine-epoxy composition, at 10% solids, 1 g of Portland cement was added and mixed thoroughly. Many commercially available amine-epoxy emulsions do not remain stable upon addition of the cement and the increase in alkalinity, and tend to curdle. Table 14 shows that each of the amine-epoxy compositions, or emulsions, of inventive Examples 45-52 continued to exhibit a stable emulsion after addition of the cement. Repeat tests were conducted with the compositions of Examples 46-47 vWth the same stable results.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
