Tunable filter arrangement<br>
The invention relates to a tunable filter arrangement. The invention further relates to a transmitter, a receiver, a mobile telephone device, and a cordless data transmission system with a tunable filter arrangement, as well as to a tunable bulk acoustic wave resonator.<br>
The stormy developments in the field of mobile telephony and the continuous miniaturization of cordless telephone devices lead to higher requirements being imposed on the individual components. Thus a high selectivity in the high frequency part is necessary for protecting the receiver from the rising number of potentially interfering signals from other systems. This is achieved, for example, by means of bandpass filters which transmit only a limited frequency band and which suppress all frequencies above and below this band.<br>
At the present moment, filters with ceramic electromagnetic resonators are among the means used for this purpose. A miniaturization of these filters, however, is limited by the electromagnetic wavelength. So-called surface acoustic wave (SAW) filters built up from surface acoustic wave resonators can be given a considerably smaller construction. This is because the acoustic wavelength is smaller than the electromagnetic wavelength by 4 to 5 orders of magnitude. A surface acoustic wave resonator comprises a piezoelectric layer on which finger-shaped electrodes are provided. A signal applied to the input electrodes excites the piezoelectric material into mechanical vibrations, which propagate in the form of acoustic waves on the upper side of the layer and are converted back into an electric signal again by the output electrodes.<br>
An alternative is formed by bulk acoustic wave (BAW) filters comprising bulk acoustic wave resonators. Bulk acoustic wave filters have advantages as regards their size, power, and IC compatibility. Bulk acoustic wave resonators are built up from three components in principle. The first component generates the acoustic wave and comprises a piezoelectric layer. Two electrodes arranged above and below the piezoelectric layer represent the second component. The third component has the task of acoustically insulating the substrate from the vibrations generated by the piezoelectric layer.<br>
It is an interesting aspect that the properties of a resonator or filter can be varied. This may be done, for example, through coupling of a resonator or filter with a<br><br>
varicap diode. It is a disadvantage of the combination ot active and passive components that the active components may be contaminated by the materials of the passive components during the manufacture of the resonator or filter.<br>
An alternative possibility is disclosed in US 5,446,306. This describes a semiconductor bulk acoustic wave resonator and a semiconductor bulk acoustic wave filter which comprises a semiconducting substrate, a first and second electrode, and arranged therebetween a piezoelectric layer of AIN or ZnO. The resonance frequency of the resonator is changed in that a DC voltage is applied to the electrodes.<br>
The invention has for its object to provide a tunable filter arrangement which can be manufactured in a simple and inexpensive manner.<br>
This object is achieved by means of a tunable filter arrangement which comprises a substrate and provided thereon an arrangement of at least two mutually coupled resonators of which at least one is connected to a capacitor with tunable capacitance.<br>
The electrical properties of the resonator, for example its resonance frequency or its anti-resonance frequency, can be changed through coupling of a resonator to a capacitor. If the resonator is present in a filter arrangement, these changes will influence the overall filter characteristic. Since the capacitor has a tunable, i.e. changeable capacitance value, these changes can be effected more or less strongly.<br>
It is preferred that the capacitor comprises a dielectric of a material having a voltage-dependent relative dielectric constant s,.<br>
Certain materials have a dielectric constant s which is strongly dependent on an applied voltage. When a DC voltage is applied to the first and the second electrode of a capacitor having a dielectric with a voltage-dependent relative dielectric constant εr, the value of the dielectric constant e, will drop, and thus the capacitance of the capacitor. This also changes the influence of the capacitor on the electrical properties of the resonator to which it is coupled.<br><br><br><br>
These materials show a particularly strong dependence of their dielectric constants 8 on an applied voltage.<br>
It is preferred that the resonators are chosen from the group comprising bulk acoustic wave resonators, surface acoustic wave resonators, and LC resonators.<br>
Filter arrangements comprising bulk acoustic wave resonators or surface acoustic wave resonators can be manufactured with a high quality factor Q and a high coupling factor k. LC resonators can be manufactured in a simple manner.<br>
It is particularly preferred that the resonators are constructed in a thin-film technology process.<br>
A construction of the resonators in thin-film technology on a substrate renders it possible to obtain such a filter arrangement with small dimensions.<br>
It is particularly highly preferred that a bulk acoustic wave resonator comprises a resonator unit of a lower and an upper electrode as well as a piezoelectric layer arranged therebetween and a reflection element arranged between the substrate and the resonator unit.<br><br>
Such a bulk acoustic wave resonator can be manufactured without cumbersome lithographic processes because the resonance frequency of the resonator is defined by the layer thickness of the piezoelectric layer. In addition, such a bulk acoustic wave resonator is clearly more robust that other types of bulk acoustic wave resonators such as single-crystal resonators, resonators with membranes, or resonators with an air gap.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the resonator connected to a capacitor of tunable capacitance is also connected to a further capacitor.<br>
It is particularly highly preferred in this embodiment that at least one capacitor is connected in series with and at least one capacitor is connected in parallel to the resonator.<br>
This embodiment offers a particularly wide range of possibilities for varying the filter characteristic.<br>
The invention furthermore relates to a transmitter, a receiver, a mobile telephone device, and a wireless data transmission system provided with a tunable filter arrangement which comprises a substrate and provided thereon an arrangement of at least two mutually coupled resonators of which at least one is connected to a capacitor with tunable capacitance.<br>
The invention furthermore relates to a tunable bulk acoustic wave resonator which comprises a substrate and provided thereon a resonator unit with a lower and an upper electrode as well as a piezoelectric layer arranged therebetween, and a reflection element which is arranged between the substrate and the resonator unit, which resonator is connected to a capacitor having a tunable capacitance value.<br>
The electrical properties of the bulk acoustic wave resonator can be trimmed over a wide range through coupling of the resonator to a tunable capacitor.<br>
The invention will now be explained in more detail below with reference to two Figures and four embodiments, with<br>

On the substrate 1 there is a reflection element 2 which is formed by a layer of an acoustically reflecting substance from the group of polymers and porous substances. The acoustically reflecting substance used may be, for example, an aerogel, a xerogel, a glass foam, a foam-type adhesive, a foamed synthetic resin, or a synthetic resin of low density. The aerogel used may be, for example, an inorganic aerogel composed of silica gel or porous SIO2 structures, or an organic aerogel such as, for example, a resorcin-formaldehyde aerogel, a melamine-formaldehyde aerogel, or a phenol-formaldehyde aerogel.

In addition, foamed synthetic resins such as, for example, phenol-formaldehyde resins or furane resins having a high porosity owing to carbonatization may be used. The synthetic resin of low density used may be, for example, a cross-linked polyvinyl ether, a cross-linked polyaryl ether, polytetrafluoroethylene, poly(p-xylylene), poly(2-chloro-p-xylylene), poly(dichloro-p-xylylene), polybenzocyclobutene, a styrol-butadiene copolymer,<br><br><br><br>

Two capacitors CA and CB are provided on the reflection element 2 in the vicinity of the resonator units. The capacitor CA has a tunable capacitance and comprises a dielectric 8 of a material which has a voltage-dependent relative dielectric constant εr. The capacitor Cg need not necessarily have a tunable capacitance and comprises the dielectric 4.<br>
The electrodes 5 and 7 of the resonator unit may be structured such that they each at the same time form an electrode of one of the capacitors CA and CB.<br>
Thus, for example, the electrode 7 may be structured such that it also forms the lower electrode of the capacitor CA with tunable capacitance. A dielectric 8 is provided on the lower electrode of the capacitor CA, and an upper electrode 9 is provided on the dielectric 8 so as to form the upper electrode 9 of the capacitor CA. The dielectric 8 comprises a material with a voltage-dependent relative dielectric constant Sr such as, for example.<br><br><br>
combinations of the compounds a) to f) with PbTiOa and/or Pb(Mgi/3Nb2/3)03 with and without excess lead and Bai_xZrxTiO3 (0 
The electrode 9 of the capacitor CA rnay comprise, for example, Agi_xPtx (0 
 <br><br><br>
The further capacitor CB is composed from a lower electrode 3, a dielectric 4, and an upper electrode. The lower electrode 5 of the resonator unit may be structured such that, for example, it also forms the upper electrode of this capacitor.<br><br><br><br>
Alternatively, the lower electrode of the capacitor CA and the upper electrode of the capacitor CB May be formed through deposition of a separate electrically conducting layer.<br>
A protective layer 10 of an organic or inorganic material, or a combination of these materials, may be provided over the entire filter arrangement. The organic material used may be, for example, polybenzocyclobutene or polyimide, and the inorganic material<br><br>
Contact holes may be opened to the electrodes 3, 5, 7, and 9 through the protective layer 10 by means of etching. Bump end contacts of Cr/Cu or Cr/Cu/Ni/Au may be grown in the contact holes. The contact to the filter input, to the filter output, and to ground may be effected through these bump end contacts. In addition, a DC voltage in a range of 1 to 100 V may be applied to the two electrodes 7, 9 of the capacitor CA. in dependence on the layer thickness of the dielectric 8.<br>
The resonator unit and the capacitors can be electrically interconnected through vias in the piezoelectric layer 6 of the resonator unit and in the dielectric layers 4 and 8 of the capacitors CA and CB.<br>
Alternatively, the reflection element 2 may comprise several layers of high and low acoustic impedance in alternation, each layer having a layer thickness of one fourth the resonance wavelength X. The material of low acoustic impedance may be, for example, an organic or inorganic aerogel, an organic or inorganic xerogel, a glass foam, a foam-type adhesive, a foamed synthetic resin, a synthetic resin of low density, or SiO2. The material of<br><br><br>
the resonator to be at the same time the upper layer of the λ/4 layers of the reflection element 2.<br>
In a further embodiment of the invention, a second reflection element may be provided on the upper electrode 7 of the bulk acoustic wave resonator.<br>
A further alternative is to provide an additional adhesive layer, for example made of an acrylate glue or an epoxy glue, between the reflection element 2 and the substrate 1. The acrylate glue may comprise, for example, acryl or methacryl monomers which polymerize during the curing process.<br>
Furthermore, a layer of SiO2 with a layer thickness of between 30 and 300 nm may be provided above or below, or above and below a reflection element 2 made of porous SiO2. These SiO2 layers, the reflection element 2, and a second reflection element may be provided over the entire region of the substrate 1 or only partly, in the region of a resonator unit.<br>
In addition, the entire filter arrangement may be provided with at least a first and a second current supply contact. The current supply contact used may be, for example, an electroplated SMD end contact of Cr/Cu, Ni/Sn, or Cr/Cu, Cu/Ni/Sn, or Cr/Ni, Pb/Sn, or Cr/Cu, Ni/Au, or a bump end contact of Cr/Cu or Cr/Cu/Ni/Au, or a contact pad.<br>
If so desired, an alternative type of bulk acoustic wave resonator such as, for example, a single-crystal resonator, a resonator with a membrane, or a resonator with an air gap may be used in the tunable filter arrangement, or a surface acoustic wave resonator with a correspondingly adapted design of the electrodes 3, 5 and the piezoelectric layer 4. It is also possible to use LC resonators which are built up from coils and capacitors.<br>
Alternative embodiments as to the construction and integration are known to those skilled in the art. Thus, for example, a tunable filter arrangement may comprise more than two resonators. It is also possible for two or more resonators to be connected to one capacitor with tunable capacitance value in a tunable filter arrangement. If a resonator is connected to several capacitors, the latter may be connected to the resonator in a wide variety of circuit arrangements.<br>
Fig. 2 shows the circuit diagram of a tunable filter arrangement. This filter arrangement, which represents no more than one out of many possible embodiments of the invention, comprises a series resonator Rl and a parallel resonator R2 connected between a filter input 11 and a filter output 12. A capacitor CI is connected in parallel to the resonator R], while a further capacitor C2 is connected in series downstream of the resonator Rl. A capacitor C3 is connected downstream in series with the parallel resonator R2, and a<br><br>
capacitor C4 is connected in parallel to the resonator R2. The second terminal of the serial capacitor C3 is connected to ground. The capacitors CI and C3 have trimmable capacitance values.<br>
Fig. 3 is a diagrammatic plan view of a filter arrangement with a circuit in accordance with Fig. 2 and a possible design of the electrodes 3, 5, 7, and 9, the dielectrics 4 and 8, and the piezoelectric layer 6.<br>
Fig. 4 shows the filter curves of a tunable filter arrangement of Fig. 2. Curve 13 here shows the filter characteristic of the filter arrangement without a DC voltage being applied to the electrodes of the capacitors CI and C3. Curve 14 shows the changed filter characteristic when a DC voltage of 5 V is applied to the capacitors CI and C3.<br>
Embodiments of the invention will be explained in more detail below, representing examples of how the invention may be realized in practice.<br>
Embodiment 1<br>
An adhesive layer of an acrylate glue is present on a substrate 1 of glass, and thereon are arranged a 300 nm thick layer of SiO2, a reflection element 2 of porous SiO2, and a 30 nm thick layer of SiO2. An electrode 5 of Pt/Ti is present on the 30 nm thick SiO2 layer. A piezoelectric layer 6 of PbZro.35Tio.65O3 lies on the electrode 5, and an electrode 7 of Ti/Pt is present on the piezoelectric layer 6. The piezoelectric layer 6 and the two electrodes 5, 7 are deposited and structured such that a filter arrangement with a series resonator Rl and a parallel resonator R2 are created. The electrode 5 is deposited and structured such that it also fonns the upper electrode of a capacitor C4 adjacent the resonator R2. The electrode 7 is deposited and structured such that it forms the lower electrode of a capacitor CI as well as the upper electrode of a capacitor C2 in the region of the bulk acoustic wave resonator R2, and forms the lower electrode of a capacitor C3 in the region of the bulk acoustic wave resonator R2. A dielectric 8 of PbZro.53Tio,47O3 with 5% lanthanum doping lies on the lower electrodes 7 of the capacitors CI and C3, and an upper electrode 9 of Pt/Ti is provided on the respective dielectrics 8. The capacitors C2 and C4 each comprise besides an upper electrode of Pt/Ti a dielectric 4 of Si3N4 and a lower electrode 3 of Al doped with 4% Cu.<br>
A protective layer 10 of SiO2 is provided over the entire filter arrangement. Contact holes are etched through the protective layer 10 to the electrodes 3, 5, 7, and 9. Bump end contacts of Cr/Cu/Ni/Au are grown in the contact holes.<br>
A bump end contact to the electrode 5 in the region of the resonator Rl serves as a contact to the filter input 11 of the filter arrangement, and a bump end contact to the<br><br>
electrode 3 in the region of the capacitor R2 serves as a contact for the filter output 12 of the filter arrangement. In addition, a bump end contact to the electrode 9 in the region of the capacitor C3 is connected to ground.<br>
The capacitors CI, C2, C3, and C4 and the resonators Rl and R2 are electrically interconnected through suitable vias in the piezoelectric layer 6, the dielectric 8, and the dielectric 4. The capacitor CI is connected in parallel to the resonator Rl, whereas the capacitor C2 is connected in series downstream of the resonator Rl. The capacitor C3 is connected in series downstream of the resonator R2, and the capacitor C4 is connected in parallel to the resonator R2.<br>
The two resonators Rl and R2 are mutually attuned such that the resonance frequency of the resonator Rl corresponds to the anti-resonance fi'equency of the resonator R2. The filter characteristic of the filter arrangement can be changed through the application of a DC voltage to the capacitors CI and C3, because the relative dielectric constant ε1 of the material of the dielectric 8 is changed thereby. The application of a DC voltage of a few volts is capable of reducing the capacitance values of the capacitors CI and C3 by up to a factor 10. As a result, the resonance frequencies and the anti-resonance frequencies of the resonators Rl and R2 are shifted, and the filter curve of the filter arrangement is shifted by a few percents. The DC voltage is applied to the electrodes 7 and 9 of the capacitors CI and C3 through the bump end contacts.<br>
Fig. 4 shows an example of such a shift. The series resonator Rl has a resonance frequency of 1 GHz, and the parallel resonator R2 has a resonance frequency of 0.95035 GHz. The four capacitors without a DC voltage applied to the electrodes of the capacitors CI and C3 have the following capacitance values: CI = 2 pF, C2 = 100 pF, C3 = 100 pF, and C4 = 10 pF. The filter characteristic of this filter arrangement is shown in curve 13. After a DC voltage of 20 V has been applied, the capacitance values of CI and C3 are reduced by the factor 10, and the bandwidth of the filter is shifted to higher frequencies. Curve 14 corresponds to this new filter characteristic.<br>
The resulting filter arrangement was used in mobile telephones as a tunable bandpass filter whose filter band can be changed.<br>

The filter characteristic of the filter arrangement can be changed through the application of a DC voltage to the capacitors CI and C3, because the relative dielectric constant e, of the material of the dielectric 8 is changed thereby. The application of a DC voltage of a few volts is capable of reducing the capacitance values of the capacitors CI and C3 by up to a factor 10. As a result, the resonance frequencies and the anti-resonance frequencies of the resonators Rl and R2 are shifted, and the filter curve of the filter arrangement is shifted by a<br><br>
tew percents. The DC voltage is applied to the electrodes 7 and 9 ot the capacitors CI and C3 through the bump end contacts.<br>

The DC voltage is applied to the electrodes 7 and 9 of the capacitors CI and C3 through the bump end contacts.<br>

Embodiment 4<br>
A reflection element 2 of alternating X/4 layers of Ta2O5 and SiO2 is present on a substrate 1 of glass. An electrode 5 of Pt/Ti lies on the reflection element 2. A piezoelectric layer 6 of AIN is present on the electrode 5, and an electrode 7 of Pt/Ti lies on the piezoelectric layer 6. The piezoelectric layer 6 and the two electrodes 5, 7 are deposited and stnjctured such that a filter arrangement with a series resonator Rl and a parallel resonator R2 are created. The electrode 5 is deposited and structured such that it also forms the upper electrode of a capacitor C4 adjacent the resonator R2. The electrode 7 is deposited and structured such that it forms the lower electrode of a capacitor CI as well as the upper electrode of a capacitor C2 in the region of the bulk acoustic wave resonator R2, and forms the lower electrode of a capacitor C3 in the region of the bulk acoustic wave resonator R2. A dielectric 8 of PbZro.53Tio.47O3 with 5% lanthanum doping lies on the lower electrodes 7 of the capacitors CI and C3, and an upper electrode 9 of Pt/Ti is provided on the respective dielectrics 8. The capacitors C2 and C4 each comprise besides an upper electrode of Pt/Ti a dielectric 4 of Si3N4 and a lower electrode 3 of Al doped with 4% Cu.<br>
A protective layer 10 of Si3N4 is provided over the entire filter arrangement. Contact holes are etched through the protective layer 10 to the electrodes 3, 5, 7, and 9. Bump end contacts of Cr/Cu/Ni/Au are grown in the contact holes.<br>
A bump end contact to the electrode 5 in the region of the resonator Rl serves as a contact to the filter input 11 of the filter arrangement, and a bump end contact to the electrode 3 in the region of the capacitor R2 serves as a contact for the filter output 12 of the<br><br>
filter arrangement. In addition, a bump end contact to the electrode 9 is connected to ground in the region of the capacitor C3.<br>
The capacitors CI, C2, C3, and C4 and the resonators Rl and R2 are electrically interconnected through suitable vias in the piezoelectric layer 6, the dielectric 8, and the dielectric 4. The capacitor CI is connected in parallel to the resonator Rl, whereas the capacitor C2 is connected in series downstream of the resonator Rl. The capacitor C3 is connected in series downstream of the resonator R2, and the capacitor C4 is connected in parallel to the resonator R2.<br>
The two resonators Rl and R2 are mutually attuned such that the resonance frequency of the resonator Rl corresponds to the anti-resonance frequency of the resonator R2. The filter characteristic of the filter arrangement can be changed through the application of a DC voltage to the capacitors CI and C3, because the relative dielectric constant Sr of the material of the dielectric 8 is changed thereby. The application of a DC voltage of a few volts is capable of reducing the capacitance values of the capacitors CI and C3 by up to a factor 10. As a result, the resonance frequencies and the anti-resonance frequencies of the resonators Rl and R2 are shifted, and the filter curve of the filter arrangement is shifted by a few percents.
