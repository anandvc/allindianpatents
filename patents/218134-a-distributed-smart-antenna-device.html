				<td>A DISTRIBUTED SMART ANTENNA DEVICE<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates generally to a distributed smart antenna device. In general it relates to a smart antenna device of cellular mobile communications system.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Smart antenna technology is a most important technology in modern mobile communications technology, especially to cellular mobile communications system. Advantages of smart antenna technology are: increasing system capacity greatly, increasing covering area of wireless base station, decreasing system cost and raising system performance etc. Therefore, smart antenna technology has become an important research subject of high technology field all over the world.<br>
A smart antenna device comprises: an antenna array consisting of N antenna elements, N radio frequency transceivers and N feeder cables connecting the N antenna elements and the N radio frequency transceivers compose a radio frequency unit. In a wireless base station, analog signals, transmitted and received by radio frequency units, are transformed by high speed ADC/DAC, and then signals transformed are connected with a data bus, which is connected with a baseband digital signal processor (DSP). Smart antenna functions such as up-link beam forming and downlink beam forming etc are implemented in the baseband DSP.<br>
Fig. 1 shows a wireless base station structure with smart antenna, with which basic structure and working principle of modern smart antenna are shown. The base station works at CDMA TDD (Code Division Multiple Access Time Division Duplex). The antenna feeder cable units<br>
are consisted of N antenna elements 11, 12, 13	, IN which consist an antenna<br>
array, and corresponding feeder cables. Each antenna feeder cable unit is connected with a<br>
radio frequency transceiver TRX 21, 22, 23, 	, 2N.N radio frequency transceivers<br>
commonly use one frequency and timing .<br>
unit 30 (local oscillator), so the radio frequency transceivers 21, 22, 23, ..., 2N work coherently. Signals received by each radio frequency transceiver is converted to digital sampling signal by an internal ADC of radio frequency transceiver, and then is sent to baseband digital signal processor 33 through high speed data bus 31. Digital signals to be transmitted on high data bus 31 is convert to analog signal by an internal DAC of radio frequency transceiver, and is transmitted by antenna elements 11, 12, 13,..., IN.<br>
All baseband digital signal processing is performed in the baseband digital signal processor 33. The processing method can refer to China Patent No. CN 97104039. In the baseband processor hardware platform with advanced digital signal processing, processing functions such as modulation arid demodulation, receiving and transmitting (uplink and downlink) and beam forming etc. can be implemented. With these processing, multiple access interference and multiple path interference can be overcome, receiving signal-to-noise ratio and sensitivity are raised and EIRP (Equivalent Isotropically Radiated Power) is increased.<br>
The applicant has noticed that at present smart antennas all use ring antenna array or linear antenna array, and the ring or linear antenna array is concentrated on one place in order to obtain an isotropical covering or a sector covering, such as the technical scheme disclosed on China Patent No. CN 97104039.<br>
hi accompanying with increase of dense and high of buildings in city, working frequency of mobile communication system is relatively high (1 to 3 GHz) in a building or a cell. In this case, as shielding function of buildings and losing in floor and wall, many shaded areas appear and coverage range of a mobile communication system i s 1 imited. hi order to solve the coverage problem, when designing cellular mobile communication system in an urban area of a city, it has to increase number of base stations. This solution will increase system investment and maintenance difficulties. Although in theory with smart antenna, coverage range of a base station will be improved, but if multiple antenna units of an antenna array are concentrated, the coverage problem cannot be fully solved.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
In order to take advantages of smart antenna, to improve coverage range of cell, to increase greatly system capacity and to decrease system cost, the invention proposes a distributed smart antenna device. The distributed concept is as follows:-<br>
First, grouping antenna feeder cable units and radio frequency transceivers of an smart antenna device, then installing different groups of antenna feeder cable units and radio frequency transceivers at different places according to coverage requirements, but using on base band digital signal processor for all groups.<br>
Technical scheme of the invention as follows:-<br>
A distributed smart antenna device comprises N antenna elements, N radio frequency transceivers and feeder cables connecting the N-antenna element s with the N radio frequency transceivers, respectively. The N radio frequency transceivers connect with a basenband<br>
4<br>
digital signal processor in a wireless communication system base station through a data bus; it is characterized that: The N antenna elements and the N radio frequency transceivers are correspondingly grouped to get multiple antenna element groups and corresponding multiple radio frequency transceivers groups. Different antenna element groups are distributed at different places of coverage range of the wireless communication system base station. Each antenna element group connects with corresponding radio frequency transceivers group. Each radio frequency transceivers group connects with the baseband digital signal processor through the data bus.<br>
According the technical scheme of the invention, the grouping is based on coverage cell range of the wireless communication system base station and traffic volume of the coverage cell range of coverage floor number of the wireless communication system base station and traffic volume of the coverage floor.<br>
According the technical scheme of the invention, each antenna element group has 1 to M antenna elements connected correspondingly with 1 to M radio frequency transceivers of corresponding radio frequency transceivers group and selection of M is based on number of mobile subscribers and propagation environment. Among them 1 to M antenna elements of one antenna element group and 1 to M radio frequency transceivers of correspondingly radio frequency transceivers group are distributed at same place, or 1 to M antenna elements of one antenna element group are distributed at same place, or 1 to M antenna elements of one antenna element group are distributed at same place, and radio frequency transceivers of correspondingly and de correspondingly radio frequency transceivers groups are distributed in concentration.<br>
According to the technical scheme of the invention, the different places comprising of different buildings as cells covered by the wireless communication system base station or different floors in a building covered by the wireless communication system base station.<br>
Wherein for the different floors in a building, the distribution can be based on that each floor is allocated with an antenna element group or one two floors are allocated with an antenna element group, and each antenna element group applies same frequency, time slot and code channel, in interleaving.<br>
Wherein for the different floors in a building, the distribution can be based on that each floor is allocated with an antenna element group, and each antenna groups applies same frequency, time slot and code channel, but different interference codes and training sequences.<br>
Technical scheme of the invention can also be as follow.<br>
A distributed smart antenna device comprises N antenna element group, N radio frequency transceiver groups and baseband digital signal processor. Each antenna element comprises 1 to m antenna elements and each radio frequency transceiver group comprises 1 to m radio frequency transceivers. One to m antenna element of one antenna element group connect correspondingly with 1 to m radio frequency transceivers of one radio frequency transceivers group to form N groups. Antenna elements of different groups are distributed on different buildings of coverage range of a wireless communication system base station, and apply same frequency, time slot and code channel radio frequency transceivers of different group connect with baseband digital signal processor through a data bus.<br>
Wherein 1 to m radio frequency transceivers and corresponding 1 to m antenna elements of one group are set on same building or different buildings.<br>
Technical scheme of the invention can also be as follow:<br>
A distributed smart antenna device comprises N antenna element groups, N radio frequency transceiver groups and a baseband digital signal processor. Each antenna element group comprises 1 to m antenna elements and each radio frequency transceiver group comprises 1 to m radio frequency transceiver. One 1 to m antenna elements of one antenna element group connect correspondingly with 1 to m radio<br>
frequency t ransceivers o f o ne r adio frequency t ransceiver group t o form N groups. Antenna elements of different groups are distributed on different floors of a building of coverage range of a wireless communication system base station, and apply, in interleaving, same frequency, time slot and code channel, or same frequency, time slot and code channel, but different interference codes and training sequences. Radio frequency transceivers of different groups connect with a baseband digital signal processor through a data bus.<br>
Wherein 1 to m radio frequency transceivers and corresponding 1 to m antenna elements of one group are set on same floor or different floors of the building.<br>
According to requirement of cell coverage range and traffic volume, the distributed smart antenna system of the invention divides antenna elements consisting an smart antenna array, correspondingly radio frequency transceivers and feeder cables into groups. Then, according to coverage requirement, each smart antenna element is distributed, in group, at different buildings of same cell or different floors of same building, but all antenna elements of each smart antenna group is concentrated at one place. All smart antenna groups and radio frequency transceiver groups commonly use one baseband digital signal processor.<br>
Wireless base station with the distributed smart antenna system will process multiple groups of antenna elements, and multiple groups of antenna elements are set at multiple places according to requirement. In this way, a better coverage effect can be obtained. Besides, according to set location of each antenna element group and mutual isolation condition, in a service range of same wireless base station, frequency can be multiplexed to raise spectrum utilization coefficient^ Especially in a CDMA mobile communication system, except using same (or different) carrier frequency, same (or different) time slot and same (or different) code channel can be used as well, i.e. wireless communication resources such as frequency, time slot and code channel can be more effectively multiplexed. This means when improving cell coverage, communication system capacity can be increased and cost of communication system can be decreased at the same time. Of course, as antenna elements of each group are set at different places, feeder cable length is different, so antenna calibration technology must be used. A specific calibration method can refer to a China Patent,<br>
proposed by the applicant of the invention,  named "Method  and Device  for Calibrating an Smart Antenna Array" with patent application number 99111350.0.<br>

Embodiments of the Invention<br>
The present invention now will be described more fully hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which preferred embodiments of the invention are shown. This invention may, however, be embodied in many different forms a nd s hould n ot b e c onstrued as 1 imited t o t he e mbodiments s et forth herein; rather, these embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will be thorough and complete, and will fully convey the scope of the invention to those skilled in the art. Like numbers refer to like elements throughout.<br>
Fig. 1 has been described before and will not be repeated again.<br>
Comparing Fig.2 with Fig.l, the difference is that in Fig.l antenna elements 11 to IN which comprise an antenna array are a ring array or a linear array concentrated at one place, but in Fig.2 antenna feeder cable units and relating radio frequency transceivers are set distributed according groups, as shown in Fig.2 antenna feeder cable unit groups 41, 42, ..., 4N and corresponding radio frequency transceiver groups 51, 52, ..., 5N. Number of antenna elements in each antenna feeder cable unit group and number of radio frequency transceivers in each radio frequency transceiver group connected corresponding can be set according requirement in really, but at least there are one antenna element and one radio frequency transceiver as shown in Fig.2,<br>
4N and 5N. There are four antenna elements and four radio frequency transceivers in antenna feeder cable unit group 42 and radio frequency transceiver group 52, respectively. Each group of antenna feeder cable units and each group of radio frequency transceivers cover an area needed to be covered, but commonly use one wireless communication system base station. Obviously, length of feeder cables, connecting each antenna feeder cable unit group with corresponding radio frequency transceiver group, i s different. In a base station of wireless communication system with a distributed smart antenna, each antenna feeder cable unit group and corresponding radio frequency transceiver group can work at different or same carrier frequency, at different or same time slot and at different or same code channel. When each antenna feeder cable unit group and corresponding radio frequency transceiver group work at same frequency, same time slot and same code channel, the capacity of the wireless communication system can be greatly increased.<br>
The base station of wireless communication system with a distributed smart antenna, mentioned above, can be practically used in microcellular and micromicrocellular mobile communication system. The microcellular and micromicrocellular mobile communication system is just a mobile communication system environment for densely populated city and dense buildings area, in the future.<br>
Fig.3 shows a distributed embodiment for a wireless communication system base stations with a distributed smart antenna used at urban area of a city. As working frequency of mobile communication system is higher, for example 2GHz, dense buildings, as shown in Fig.3 the 12 rectangles 101, obstruct transmission signal seriously. In order to provide enough capacity, a communication system design applies micro cell design, in general; and antenna height does not excess average height of roofs in the micro cell. If a wireless communication system base station applies concentrated smart antenna structure as shown in Fig.l, the coverage of antenna system will be very limited (reference to ITU-R M. 1225 proposal).<br>
In this embodiment, a wireless communication system base station 102 uses three antenna feeder cable unit groups 103, 105 and 107. Three antenna feeder cable unit groups are distributed at three places. The result is that one wireless communication system base station equivalently implements coverage areas of three wireless communication system base stations 104,106 and 108. Within areas 104,106<br>
and 108 covered by three different antenna feeder cable unit groups respectively, -same carrier frequency, same time slot and same code channel can be used. Consequently, capacity of mobile communication system is multiplied. As one baseband digital signal processor of base station is used commonly in a wireless communication system, so coverage area of the base station is improved, and subscriber average cost is greatly decreased at the same time.<br>
Fig.4 shows a distributed embodiment for a base station of wireless communication system with a distributed smart antenna used at high building. It is popularly known that when carrier frequency is higher, for example 2 GHz frequency range, radio wave is seriously lost by building floors and walls. In general, radio wave can only penetrate 3 to 4 floors or walls. If smart antenna structure of a wireless communication system base station is concentrated as shown in Fig. 1, it is impossible to cover the whole buildings 110 excellently.<br>
In the embodiment shown in Fig.4, the wireless communication system base station 112 uses four antenna feeder cable unit groups 115, 117, 113 and 119 which are d istributed on four floors 11, 8, 5 and 2 floor. The result is that by using one wireless communication system base station implements equivalently four wireless communication system base station coverage ranges 116, 118, 114 and 120. In these four areas 116, 118, 114 and 120 covered by four antenna feeder cable unit groups 115, 117, 113 and 119 respectively, each interleaved antenna feeder cable unit group (interleaving one coverage range) can use same carrier frequency, same time slot and same code channel. For example, antenna feeder cable unit groups 115 and 113 can work with same carrier frequency, time slot and code channel, and antenna feeder cable unit groups 117 and 119 can work with another carrier frequency, time slot and code channel. Consequently, capacity of mobile communication system is greatly increased. As one wireless communication system base station uses commonly one baseband digital signal processor, so subscriber average cost is greatly decreased while improving coverage.<br>
hi a base station of wireless communication system with a distributed smart antenna, number of antenna feeder cable unit groups is selected by geographical area or building height (or number of floors) of covering cell, and number of antenna elements and their capacity in each group is selected by number of wireless mobile<br>
subscribers in coverage range of each antenna feeder cable unit group. Fig.4 shows that every two floors install one group of antenna feeder cable unit, and then each interleaved group can use same carrier frequency, time slot and code channel.<br>
In a distributed smart antenna system, according to requirement, user can flexibly set number of smart antenna groups, select number of antenna elements in each group and select setting location of each group. Then tlirough software in baseband digital signal processor the whole communication system can operate at an optimized state.<br>
Taking a building wireless communication system as an example, there are many possible requirements.<br>
The first possible situation is as follow. The total number of mobile subscribers in the building is not so many, code channels of a general wireless communication system base station satisfies the requirement. Nevertheless, the subscribers are distributed at every floor of the building. If using a concentrated smart antenna, as shown in Fig.l, a base station can only cover at most 3 to 4 floors. If using a distributed smart antenna system of the invention, one group of antenna feeder cable unit can be set at each one to two floors, and each group of antenna feeder cable unit includes 1 to M antenna elements. The number of M is related to number of subscribers and signal propagation environment.<br>
The second possible situation is as follow. The total number of mobile subscribers in the building is many, code channels of a general wireless communication system base station does not satisfy the requirement, and subscribers are not well-distributed between every floor of the building from the installation of antenna feeder cable unit point of view. If using a concentrated smart antenna shown in Fig. 1, space diversity advantage of smart antenna will be affected. If using a smart antenna system of the invention, all antenna elements can be divided into several groups and each group is installed at a floor, then each group of antenna feeder cable unit uses same frequency, time slot and code channel, but different interference code and training sequence. It likes setting up many independent base stations of micro-micro cell. With this method, processing ability of existing radio frequency transceivers and baseband digital signal processor is greatly utilized and the whole communication system is optimized.<br>
During baseband processing, first respective processing antenna feeder cable unit information in every group, then diversity processing antenna feeder cable units information of each group, and getting a uplink signal data for uplink beam forming. Then, selecting the antenna feeder cable unit with maximum receiving power, subscriber destination of arrival (DOA) information of the unit is taken to get downlink signal data for downlink beam forming (wherein method of obtaining subscriber DOA information refers to China Patent named "Time Division Duplex Synchronized CDMA Wireless Communication System with Smart Antenna" with Patent No. CN 97104039.7). If it is the situation mentioned above, as using distributed smart antenna system, affection of electromagnetic wave loss can be overcome, so a base station can cover 7 to 8 floors or even more than 10 floors.<br>
In summary, in a distributed smart antenna system of the invention, antenna elements, relating feeder cables and radio frequency transceivers, which comprise the smart antenna system, are divided into groups, according to coverage range of cell (or building); s electing n umber o f a ntenna e lements o f every group i s b ased on traffic volume; and every antenna feeder cable unit group is installed at different places (or different floors); but a common baseband digital signal processor of base station is used. Therefore, advantage of a smart antenna is fully developed; and when improving cell coverage, system capacity is greatly increased and system cost is decreased at the same time.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
