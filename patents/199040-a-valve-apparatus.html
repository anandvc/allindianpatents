				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a valve apparatus for splitting fluid by a pair of plugs provided to one shaft thereof.<br>
Description of the Prior Art<br>
Fig. 38 is a sectional view showing a conventional valve apparatus having a double-sheeted structure, and in this figure, a reference numeral 1 denotes an upper cover of the valve apparatus; 2 illustrates a lower cover; and 3 shows a valve case (a valve main body).  A reference numeral 5 represents an upper plug, and 6 Indicates a lower plug.  The upper plug 5 and the lower plug 6 are provided to a valve shaft 4 so as to make the same axis, and are shifted in the upper and lower directions along with the valve shaft 4.  A reference numeral 7 denotes an upper sheet ring making a pair with the upper plug 5, and 8 illustrates a lower sheet ring making a pair with the lower plug 6.  A reference numeral 9 shows an inflow opening of the valve case 3, and 10 represents an outflow opening of the valve case 3.  A reference numeral 11 indicates an upper port section defined by the upper sheet ring 7, and 12 denotes a lower port section defined by the lower sheet ring 8.  A reference numeral 11a illustrates an upper current path in which fluid flown from the upper port<br><br>
section 11 flows, and 12a shows a lower current path in which fluid from the lower port section 12 flows.  A reference numeral 2a represents a guide hole provided to the lower cover to guide the lower plug 6.<br>
Next, an operation will be described.<br>
The fluid is flown into the valve case 3 from the inflow opening 9, then flown out from the outflow opening 10.  In the case that the amount of lift is 0%, i.e., the upper plug 5 and the upper sheet ring 7 are closely touched and the lower plug 6 and the lower sheet ring 8 are closely touched each other, there is no inflow and outflow of the fluid.<br>
When the upper plug 5 and the lower plug 6 are shifted by the valve shaft 4, the fluid flown from the Inflow opening 9 is flown in the upper current path 11a via the upper port section 11, and also flown in the lower current path 12a via the lower port section 12.  The fluid passed in the upper current path 11a and the lower current path 12a is flown out from the outflow opening 10.<br>
Since the conventional valve apparatus Is constituted as described above, there are problems as follows.<br>
a) In the conventional valve apparatus, two pairs of plug and sheet ring are provided so as to split the fluid flowing into the upper and lower portions, and it is characterized in that fluid power unbalance between such upper and lower flows is mostly offset each other. However, as will be understood from Fig. 39 showing an example of a relation between the amount of lift and the<br><br>
P<br><br>
r<br>
mbalance power, although the unbalance power is urged in a )ositive direction (a direction to open the valve) in the :ase that the amount of lift is 0 to 50%, the unbalance )ower is suddenly changed to the direction to a negative lirection (a direction to close the valve) after the amount )f lift is over 50%, then increases up to 100%.<br>
Although the change of the unbalance power from the positive direction into the negative direction is at the Joint of 50% of the amount of lift in Fig. 39, if considered with other examples, the change of the unbalance 30wer from the positive direction into the negative lirection is caused in a range of 30 to 50%.<br>
While the unbalance power is urged to the positive lirection, an operational device (not shown) controls the i^alve in the direction to close, with the upper plug 5 and the lower plug 6 being pushed through the valve shaft 4. In this state, if the unbalance power is changed into the negative direction, since the upper plug 5 and the lower plug 6 operate so as to close the valve, the operational device controls the valve in the direction to open for keeping the degree of opening of the valve.  Besides, the more the change of the unbalance power in the negative direction is rapid, the more the control of the operational device becomes rapid, thereby causing a problem that the control of the operational device becomes unstable when the amount of lift is over a specific range.<br>
b) The guide hole 2a is formed to the lower cover 2, and a lower end portion of the lower plug 6 is inserted<br><br>
/ into this guide hole 2a to carry out the guiding for the<br>
lower plug 6.  Owing to this, the depth of the guide hole<br>
2a is required for keeping at least the length of the lower<br>
portion of the lower plug 6, thereby causing a problem that<br>
the valve apparatus in itself becomes long in the lower<br>
side direction.<br>
c)	There is a problem that enough space margin under the bottom surface of the lower cover 2 is required for opening the lower cover 2 at the maintenance for the main body of the valve apparatus.<br>
d)	There is a problem that operativity is so bad if there is no enough space at the lower portion of the main body of the valve apparatus, when the lower cover 2 is removed to perform the maintenance of the valve apparatus itself, after the valve apparatus is connected with pipes.<br>
e)	Because the upper plug 5 and the lower plug 6 have approximately the same shape, a flow ratio between an upper fluid and a lower fluid at the time of synchronous valve opening becomes 1:1, and if the flow ratio is thus the same, a thrust (unbalance power) forced to each of the upper and lower plug s 5 and 6 in the axis direction as a fluid reaction force is rapidly changed near the degree of half opening in which the upper and lower plugs 5 and 6 have actual opening degree, thereby causing a problem that the valve control becomes unstable or uncontrollable.<br>
In other words, the thrust in the axis direction caused by the difference of fluid pressures operated thereto is changed largely near the half opening degree,<br><br>
and is rapidly turned over, in tne ootn upper and lower plugs 5 and 6 which are formed as approximately the same shape such that the flow ratio between the upper fluid and the lower fluid at the valve opening becomes equal to each other.  Such rapid reverse of the thrust caused by generating an unstable drawing flow of the fluid around the lower plug 6 having approximately the same shape as the upper plug 5 as shown in Fig. 40(a), thereby to generate a portion P in which the thrust is largely changed, even if the plug position is constant as shown in Fig. 40(b).<br>
Here, if the plug opening is controlled by a diaphragm operational device for adjusting the amount of the fluid at the time when the thrust is turned over, a panting action is occurred, therefore, there is a problem that the control by the diaphragm operational device becomes unstable, or becomes uncontrollable with the diaphragm operational device being made incongruous.<br>
f)	The fluid flown out from a gap generated between<br>
the upper plug 5 and the upper sheet ring 7 is flown into<br>
the upper current path 11a, and the flowing direction of<br>
the fluid is changed into the direction of the outflow<br>
opening 10 of the fluid at the upper current path 11a,<br>
after colliding with the bottom surface of the upper cover<br>
1 forming an upper inside surface of the upper current path 11a, thereby causing a problem that noise or oscillation is generated with the fluid flowing being tumbled at this time.<br>
g)	The fluid flown out from a gap generated between<br><br>
the lower plug 6 and the lower sheet ring 8 is flown into the lower current path 12a, and the flowing direction of the fluid is changed into the direction of the outflow opening 10 of the fluid at the lower current path 12a, after colliding with the upper surface of the lower cover 2 forming a bottom surface of the lower current path 12a, thereby causing a problem that noise or oscillation is generated with the fluid flowing being tumbled at this time also.<br>
h) In adjustment of the sheet pitch in the vertical direction of the upper sheet ring 7 and the lower sheet ring 8 with reference to the valve case 3, the upper sheet ring 7 and the lower sheet ring 8 are screwed in the valve case 3 respectively, and are removed after the sheet surface at such a screwed state is measured, then the sheet surface is further processed, as well as screwed again into the valve case 3 to measure, thus it is repeated.  Owing to this, in the valve apparatus having a plurality of plugs, it was a complicated operation.<br>
i) Since the upper sheet ring 7 and the lower sheet ring 8 are fixed to the valve case 3 respectively by screws, adjustment of the upper sheet ring 7 is carried out after the upper cover 1 is removed from the valve case 3, and adjustment of the lower sheet ring 8 is performed after removing the lower cover 2 from the valve case 3, thereby causing a problem that the operation of the adjustment takes time.<br>
j) Since the guide hole 2a having a predetermined<br><br>
depth must be provide to the lower cover 2, and this causes the thickness of the lower cover becomes large, so that the amount of the projection of the bottom of the valve case 3 becomes large, there Is a problem that the lower cover 2 cannot be removed because enough lower operational space cannot be obtained after the valve apparatus is installed, k) In addition, a plug guide portion 13 is formed as one body with the plugs 5 and 6, so that if the plug guide portion 13 is damaged by oscillation or erosion, or is required to change on a maintenance, the plugs 5 and 6 must be also changed, thereby causing a problem of uneconomical.<br>

and 26 indicates a lower plug.  The upper plug 25 and the<br>
lower plug 26 are provided to a valve shaft 24 so as to<br>
make the same axis, and are shifted in the upper and lower<br>
directions along with the valve shaft 24.  A reference<br>
numeral 27 denotes an upper sheet ring making a pair with<br>
the upper plug 25, and 28 illustrates a lower sheet ring<br>
making a pair with the lower plug 26.  A reference numeral<br>
29 shows an inflow opening of the valve case 23, and 30<br>
represents an outflow opening of the valve case 23.  A<br>
reference numeral 31 indicates an upper port section<br>
defined by the upper sheet ring 27, and 32 denotes a lower<br>
port section defined by the lower sheet ring 28.  A<br>
reference numeral 31a illustrates an upper current path in<br>
which a fluid flown from the upper port section 31 flows,<br>
and 32a shows a lower current path in which a fluid from<br>
the lower port section 32 flows.<br>
In this first embodiment, the lower current path 32a is narrowly formed such that the flow of fluid here Is smaller by only a predetermined value than the flow of fluid flowing the upper current path 31a.<br>
Next, the description will be made about operations.<br>
The fluid is flown into the valve case 23 from the inflow opening 29, then flown out from the outflow opening 30.  In the case that the amount of lift is 0%, i.e., the upper plug 25 and the upper sheet ring 27 are closely touched and the lower plug 26 and the lower sheet ring 28 are closely touched each other, there is no inflow and<br><br>
outflow of the fluid.<br>
When the upper plug 25 and the lower plug 26 are shifted to the upper direction by the valve shaft 24, the fluid flown from the inflow opening 29 is flown in the upper current path 31a via the upper port section 31, and also flown in the lower current path 32a via the lower port section 32.  The fluid passed in the upper current path 31a and the lower current path 32a is flown to outside from the outflow opening 30.<br>
Fig. 2 is a view showing a relation between the lift amount and the unbalance power according to the first embodiment of the present invention.  In the figure, in the case that the flow of the upper current path 31a assumes 1.0, a mark O shows a case that the flow ratio of the lower current path 32a assumes 0.7, and a mark D shows a case that the flow ratio of the lower current path 32a assumes 0.9.  Both the unbalance powers are developed stably with small values having the positive direction between the lift amount 0% and 60%.  When the lift amount becomes 70%, the both unbalance powers are increased a little in the positive direction.  When the lift amount becomes 80%, the unbalance power becomes close to level 0 in the case that the flow ratio of the lower current path 32a is 0.7 (mark O). and the unbalance power becomes a large value having the positive direction in the case that the flow ratio of the lower current path 32a is 0.9 (mark D).  Although there is not shown in Fig. 2, when the flow ratio of the lower current path 32a is 0.7 or below, the<br><br>
unbalance power changes into the negative direction from the positive direction at 80% of the lift amount.  In addition, when the flow of the lower current path 32a is 0.9 or more, if the lift amount goes over 80%, the unbalance power becomes a large value having still the positive direction.  Therefore, in the case that the flow of the upper current path 31a is assumed as 1.0, if the flow ratio of the lower current path 32a is set to a range of 0.7 to 0.9, the unbalance power is maintained a positive small value in all the lift amount 0% to 100%.<br>
Since the operational device (not shown) drives the valve shaft 24 in the opposite direction of the unbalance power direction to keep the valve opening degree as a predetermined value, the control of the operational device becomes unstable when the unbalance power direction changes into the positive direction from the negative direction, or into the negative direction from the positive direction. In other words, the control of the operational device develops stably, if the unbalance power keeps a small value having either the positive direction or the negative direction in all range of the lift amount 0% to 100%.  As mentioned above, a condition satisfying this is to set the flow ratio of the upper current path 31a : lower current path 32a to from 1.0 : 0.7 to 1.0 : 0.9.<br>
In this valve apparatus according to the embodiment 1, to satisfy the flow of the upper current path 31a : the flow of the lower current path 32a = 1.0 : 0.7 to 1.0 : 0.9, the minimum sectional area portion in the lower<br><br><br>
current path 32a is set smaller than the minimum sectional area portion in the upper current path 31a by only a predetermined value.  The fluid flown into the valve case 23 from the inflow opening 29 is separated into two flowings as upper and lower portions.  One is flown in the upper current path 31a via the upper port section 31.  The other is flown in the lower current path 32a via the lower port section 32.  At this time, the upper current path 31a and the lower current path 32a are formed such that the flow of the upper current path 31a : the flow of the lower current path 32a = 1.0 : 0.7 to 1.0 : 0.9 is satisfied.<br>
For instance, if the upper current path 31a and the lower current path 32a are formed such that the ratio between these sectional areas becomes 1.0 : 0.7 to 1.0 : 0.9, the flow of the upper current path 31a : the flow of the lower current path 32a = 1.0 : 0.7 to 1.0 : 0.9 can be satisfied.<br>
As described above, according to the embodiment 1, since the ratio of the amount of both the upper and lower flowing can be set as an optimum value, the unbalance power can be maintained as a small value having one direction in all over the lift amount.<br>

In this embodiment 2, the upper plug 25 and the lower plug 26 are provided such that the center axis 34 of the current path at the inflow side is positioned lower than the symmetrical center axis 33 making a line between the center of the inflow opening 2 and the center of the outflow opening of the valve apparatus.  As the result, the sectional area of the lower current path 32a is smaller than the sectional area of the upper current path 31a by only a predetermined value.  If this predetermined value is set to the optimum value, the flow of the upper current path 31a : the flow of the lower current path 32a =1.0 : 0.7 to 1.0 : 0.9 can be satisfied.<br>
Next, the description will be made of operations.<br>
The fluid flown into the valve case 23 from the inflow opening 29 is separated into two flowings as upper<br><br>
/<br>
and lower portions.  One is flown in the upper current path 31a via the upper port section 31, and the other is flown in the lower current path 32a via the lower port section 32.  At this time, since the sectional area of the lower current path 32a is smaller than the sectional area of the upper current path 31a by the predetermined value, the flow of the upper current path 31a : the flow of the lower current path 32a = 1.0 : 0.7 to 1.0 : 0.9 is satisfied.  As described above, according to the embodiment 2, since the ratio of the amount of both the upper and lower flowing can be set as an optimum value, the unbalance power can be maintained as a small value having one direction in all over the lift amount.<br>

In addition, either male screw portions 71e, 72e and 73e or the male screw portions 71f, 72f and 73f can be omitted in the above-described sheet ring 71, 72 and 73, and the female screw portions which are to be engaged with such omitted male screw portions at the side of the valve main body may not be also provided in accordance with requirement.  In the case of this structure, the production of the sheet rings 71, 72 and 73 can be made simple and easy in comparison with the case that both the male screw portions 71e, 72e and 73e and the male screw portions 71f,<br><br>
72f and 73f are formed.<br>
Next, the description will be made of the operations.<br>
In this valve apparatus, the first plug 60 and the second plug 61 are vertically pushed to the lower direction by a push spring located in the diaphragm operational device generally, and as a result of this, the first plug 60 is closely attached to the first sheet ring organizing portion 71a (72a, 73a) as well as the second plug 61 is closely attached to the second sheet ring organizing portion 71b (72b, 73b), thus the gaps between the upper outflow direction changing chamber 58 and the lower outflow direction changing chamber 59 and the inflow opening 52 are made as closed condition.  In this case, if the diaphragm operational device is operated, an upper direction force is generated vertically, and the first plug 60 and the second plug 61 are vertically shifted in the upper direction via the plug driving rod 65.  As a result of this, gaps are generated between the first plug 60 and the first sheet ring organizing portion 71a (72a, 73a) and between the second plug 61 and the second sheet ring organizing portion 71b (72b, 73b), thereby forming a flowing path with the gap between the upper outflow direction changing chamber 58 and the lower outflow direction changing chamber 59 and the inflow opening 52 being connected.  In this case, the gap size between the first plug 60 and the first sheet ring organizing portion 71a (72a, 73a) and between the second plug 61 and the second sheet ring organizing portion 71b (72b, 73b) can be controlled by the diaphragm operational<br><br>
\ device, and is adjusted flexibly as a valve opening degree.<br>
Moreover, the flowing fluid flown into the upper outflow direction changing chamber 58 which is moved up via the gap generated between the first plug 60 and the first sheet ring organizing portion 71a (72a, 73a) is flown along with the side wall of the upper outflow direction changing chamber 58, as well as along with the streamlined concave surface 74 which is continue to the side wall, and the flowing direction is changed at the upper outflow direction changing chamber 58, thereby flowing from the outflow opening 53.  On the other hand, the direction of the flowing fluid flown into the lower outflow direction changing chamber 59 via the gap generated between the second plug 61 and the second sheet ring organizing portion 71b (72b, 73b) becomes upward in the lower outflow direction changing chamber 59 at his time, to send from the outflow opening 53 to the lower flowing side.<br>
At this time, since the upper outflow direction changing chamber 58 is formed so as to be extended in the longitudinal direction than that of the lower outflow direction changing chamber 59, and has larger volume than that of the lower outflow direction changing chamber 59, the fluid flown from the upper side inflow opening 52 is flown into the upper outflow direction changing chamber 58 largely than that of the lower outflow direction changing chamber 59.  Owing to this, a pressure for pushing the first plug 60 up becomes stronger than a pressure for pushing the second plug 61 down, and in the case that the<br><br>
diaphragm operational device pushes the first plug 60 and the second plug 61 to upper direction thus a flowing path is generated, the operation is made in the direction that the control of the first plug 60 and the second plug 61 becomes easy.  Therefore, the fluid flown into the upper outflow direction changing chamber 58 is flown to lower direction at this time in the upper outflow direction changing chamber 58, thereby sending to the lower flowing side from the outflow opening 53.  At this time, since the streamlined concave surface 74 has continuously connected to the curved surface which belongs to the side wall of the upper outflow direction changing chamber 58, a separating eddy or flowing confusion which are easy to generate when the flowing direction of the fluid is changed in the upper outflow direction changing chamber 58 is restrained, so that an effective flowing is generated, and a high CV value can be achieved, as well as oscillations and an uncontrollable state of the first plug 60, the second plug 61 and the valve main body 51 are prevented, which is often generated by unbalance between pressures operated to the first plug 60 and the second plug 61, whereby the fluid flow can be adjusted stably.<br>
In addition, as the structure of the valve main body 51, since the opening portion when the upper cover 55 is removed is made by only ceiling surface of the upper outflow direction changing chamber 58, the rigidity of the valve main body 51 can be made high, and the minimization including the weight can be achieved.<br><br>
Furthermore, in the above description, although there is explained that the upper outflow direction changing chamber 58 is extended in the longitudinal direction than the lower outflow direction changing chamber 59, It may be formed such that the lower outflow direction changing chamber 59 is extended in the longitudinal direction than the upper outflow direction changing chamber 58 so as to have larger volume than that of the upper outflow direction changing chamber 58.  Moreover, in such feature, the install direction of the first plug 60 and the second plug 61 becomes reverse direction, so that the sheet rings 71, 72 and 73 are screwed into the valve main body 51 from the lower side, after removing the lower cover from the valve main body 51.<br>
In addition, although the first sheet ring organizing portioji 71a, the second sheet ring organizing portion 71b are fo/med as one body in the embodiment 6, each of these sheet ring organizing portions may be made independently.<br>
EMBODIMENT 7<br>
Fig. 16 is a sectional view of a valve apparatus according to the seventh embodiment of the present invention, and the same parts or similar parts as of the sixth embodiment in Fig. 12 have the same reference numerals, thereby omitting repetitious description.<br>
In this embodiment 7, a concave curved surface (rapidly extended portion) 60a is formed, and a taper surface 61a having a conical surface shape is formed on the<br><br>
lower plug 61, as well as the upper plug 60 is made thin and the lower plug 61 is made thick, thus the upper plug 60 and the lower plug 61 are made different each other.<br>
In other words, by making the upper plug 60 and the lower plug 61 different each other as mentioned in the above, the upper flow of the fluid toward the upper outflow direction changing chamber 58 becomes larger than the lower flow of the fluid toward the lower outflow direction changing chamber 59 at the synchronous valve opening of both the upper and lower plugs 60 and 61, hence the ratio of the upper and lower flow is set so as to assume 6 : 4 to 9 : 1.<br>
In the upper plug 60 and the lower plug 61 thus formed, the thrust force (unbalance power) generated in the axis direction when the valve is opened is not turned over until 0% to 85% or so of the plug opening degree.<br>
On the other hand, the valve main body 51 is formed as a structure that the volume of the upper outflow direction changing chamber 58 becomes larger than the volume of the lower outflow direction changing chamber 59, thus the upper directional fluid is easy to flow and the lower directional fluid is hard to flow in comparison with the upper directional fluid.<br>
In addition, the side wall 51a of the valve main body 51 is formed as a shape in which the lower side is narrower like a flowerpot.  The valve main body 51 formed like such flowerpot shape can be made as a compact structure in the vertical direction in comparison with the conventional one<br><br>
having the same rate of the upper and lower flow as of this case.<br>
Furthermore, a bypass groove 68 is provided to the periphery of a guide shaft 66 along with the axis direction, a space portion in a guide hole 67 is connected with the lower outflow direction changing chamber 59 by this bypass groove 68, whereby the fluid remained in this space portion is escaped to the lower outflow direction changing chamber 59 when the lower plug 61 is going down.<br>
Next, the description will be made of the operations.<br>
When the upper plug 60 and the lower plug 61 is synchronously opened by the diaphragm operational device (not shown), the fluid flown into the valve main body 51 is separated into an upper direction fluid and a lower direction fluid in the sheet ring 71, and the upper direction fluid is, as well as the lower direction fluid is flown into the lower outflow direction changing chamber 59 along with the taper surface 61a of the lower plug 61 from a lower port 71-2 of the sheet ring 71, then these fluid flown into the upper outflow direction changing chamber 58 and the lower outflow direction changing chamber 59 are combined near the outflow opening 53 and flown out from the outflow opening.<br>
In such flowing of the fluid in the valve main body 51, the upper plug 60 is functioned such that the upper direction fluid toward the upper outflow direction changing chamber 58 is made easy to flow by the concave curved surface 60a, and the lower plug 61 is functioned such that<br><br>
the lower direction fluic direction changing chamber 59 is made hard to flow by the taper surface 61a, whereby the flow of the upper direction fluid becomes large and the flow of the lower direction fluid becomes small.  Owing to this, the upper plug 60 functions such that the upper direction fluid is a main flow, and the lower direction fluid is a balancing flow.<br>
In other words, the lower direction fluid flown as shown by an arrow in Fig. 17(a) along with the taper surface 61a having conical shape of the lower plug 61 becomes the balancing flow in which the flow is smaller than that of the upper direction fluid, so that a drawing flow of the fluid around the lower plug 61 becomes stable as shown in Fig. 17(b), whereby the thrust force in the axis direction is not rapidly turned over because the thrust force does not change largely.<br>
On the other hand, in the conventional valve apparatus in which the concave curved surface 6a is formed to the lower plug 6, an unstable drawing flow of the fluid is generated as shown in Fig. 40(a), so that a portion that the thrust force largely changed generates and a rapid reverse of the thrust force is generated as shown in Fig. 40(b).<br>
In addition, when the upper and lower plugs 60 and 61 are gone down to adjust the flow of the upper direction fluid and the lower direction fluid, the fluid maintained in the space portion of the guide hole 67 of the lower plug 60 is escaped into the lower outflow direction changing<br><br>
chamber 59 via the bypass groove 68 which Is made along with the axis direction of the guide shaft 66.  Thus, by escaping the fluid maintained in the space portion of the guide hole 67 along with the axis direction of the guide shaft 66 by the bypass groove 68, the drawing flow generated around the lower plug 61 is not confused by such escaped fluid.<br>
Fig. 18 is a comparing view showing a relation between a thrust force characteristic and the opening degree in the seventh embodiment valve apparatus and the conventional valve apparatus.  In addition, as the valve apparatus according to the seventh embodiment, as shown in Fig. 19, the concave curved surface 60a and a characteristic portion 60b are provided to the upper plug 60, and a rectifying portion 61a which has an angle of 30' with reference to the vertical line Y and a characteristic portion 61b are provided, thus the shape of the upper plug 60 and the lower plug 61 are formed differently.  These characteristic portions 60b and 61b decide a flowing characteristic with respect to the opening degree.<br>
The above-mentioned plug is formed as one body by cutting and processing a rod member having a predetermined size.  Or a valve shaft portion A, an upper plug portion B, a connecting shaft portion C and a lower plug portion D are respectively produced, then a whole body is formed by welding these portions.  Otherwise, there is produced by cutting operations, after forming as one body by welding materials having predetermined shapes corresponding to each<br><br>
portions A, B, C and D.  According to such last two producing way, the waste of materials can be reduced.<br>
As clearly understood from the comparing view in Fig. 18, in the conventional valve apparatus in which the upper plug 60 and the lower plug 61 are approximately the same shape, although the thrust force is changed as a smooth curve until the opening degree is 0% to 50%, the thrust force is largely changed and rapidly turned over near 60% where is around the central opening degree of the actual opening degree.<br>
In comparison with such conventional valve apparatus, in the valve apparatus according to the seventh embodiment of this invention, the thrust force is smoothly changed between 0% and 85% of the opening degree, and this means that the thrust is not turned over between 0% and 85% of the opening degree.<br>
Accordingly, in the conventional valve apparatus, although the flowing control by the diaphragm operational device becomes unstable or uncontrollable because of the rapid reverse of the thrust around the central opening degree, in the present invention valve apparatus, as mentioned above, since the thrust does not turn over from a descent condition to an ascent condition between 0% and 85% of the opening degree, misgiving which is occurred in the conventional valve apparatus like the unstable or uncontrollable of the flow control near the central opening degree as the actual opening degree is totally cleared up, whereby an opening degree range in which a stable control<br><br>
can be performed can be extended.<br>
Although the above description is of the case that the taper surface 60b is formed as an angle of 30° with reference to the vertical line Y, even if such inclined angle is set in the range of 20° to 45°, and the ratio of the upper and lower flow is set from 6 : 4 to 9 : 1, the same operational effects can be obtained.<br>

body with the first plug 90, 92 denotes a first sheet ring (upper sheet ring) for stopping the connection between the upper outflow direction changing chamber 88 and the inflow opening 82 of the fluid by closely attaching with the first plug 90, 93 denotes a second sheet ring (lower sheet ring) for stopping the connection between the lower outflow direction changing chamber 89 and the inflow opening 82 of the fluid by closely attaching with the second plug 91. These first sheet ring 92 and the second sheet ring 93 are fixed to the valve main body 81 by screws.  A reference numeral 94 illustrates a plug upper end portion formed as one body with the first plug 90 and the second plug 91, 95 shows a plug driving rod (valve shaft) connected with the plug upper end portion 94, 96 represents a diaphragm operational device for shifting the first plug 90 and the second plug 91 vertically in the upper direction, 97 indicates a scale portion for displaying the shift amount of the first plug 90 and the second plug 91 in the vertical direction.<br>
A reference numeral 98 denotes a concave surface having a streamlined shape which is formed at the bottom of the upper cover 85 making an upper Inside surface of the upper outflow direction changing chamber 88.  This concave surface 98 having the streamlined shape is formed so as to continuously connect with a curved surface which belongs to a side wall of the upper outflow direction changing chamber 88, and has a continuity with reference to the curved surface which the side wall has, such that a disorder<br><br>
generated when the flowing direction of the fluid flown from the gap generated between the first plug 90 and the first sheet ring 92 is changed into the direction to the outflow opening 83 along with the side wall of the upper outflow direction changing chamber 88 is restrained.<br>
Next, the description will be made of the operations.<br>
In this valve, the first plug 90 and the second plug 91 are vertically pushed to the lower direction by a push spring (not shown) located in the diaphragm operational device 96 generally, and as a result of this, the first plug 90 is closely attached to the first sheet ring 92 as well as the second plug 91 is closely attached to the second sheet ring 93, thus the gaps between the upper outflow direction changing chamber 88 and the lower outflow direction changing chamber 89 and the inflow opening 82 are made as closed condition.  In this situation, if the diaphragm operational device 96 is operated, an upper direction force is generated vertically, and the first plug 90 and the second plug 91 are vertically shifted in the upper direction with the plug driving rod 95.  As a result of this, gaps are generated between the first plug 90 and the first sheet ring 92 and between the second plug 91 and the second sheet ring 93, thereby forming a flowing path with the intervals between the upper outflow direction changing chamber 88 and the lower outflow direction changing chamber 89 and the inflow opening 82 being connected.  In this case, the gap size between the first plug 90 and the first sheet ring 92 and between the second<br><br>
plug 91 and the second sheet ring 93 can be controlled by the diaphragm operational device 96, and is adjusted flexibly as a valve opening degree.<br>
Moreover, the flowing fluid flown into the upper outflow direction changing chamber 88 which is moved up via the gap generated between the first plug 90 and the first sheet ring 92 is flown along with the side wall of the upper outflow direction changing chamber 88, as well as along with the streamlined concave surface 98 which is continue to the side wall, and the flowing direction of the fluid is changed at the upper outflow direction changing chamber 88, as well as is flown to lower direction at this time in the upper outflow direction changing chamber 88, thereby sending to the lower flowing side from the outflow opening 83.  At this time, since the streamlined concave surface 98 has continuously connected to the curved surface which belongs to the side wall of the upper outflow direction changing chamber 88, a separating eddy or flowing confusion which are easy to generate when the flowing direction of the fluid is changed in the upper outflow direction changing chamber 88 is restrained, so that an effective flowing is generated.<br>
On the other hand, the flowing fluid flown into the lower outflow direction changing chamber 89 which is moved up via the gap generated between the second plug 91 and the second sheet ring 93 is toward the upper side at this time in the lower outflow direction changing chamber 89, and sent to the lower flowing side from the outflow opening 83<br><br>
of the fluid.  In this case, if the bottom of the lower cover 84 forming one part of the inside surface of the lower outflow direction changing chamber 89 is made as a concave surface 98 having a streamlined shape for reducing a resistance when the fluid is flown in similar to the case of the upper cover 85, the separating eddy or flowing confusion which are easy to generate when the flowing direction of the fluid is changed in the lower outflow direction changing chamber 89 is restrained, so that an effective flowing is generated.<br>
EMBODIMENT 9<br>
Fig. 21 is sectional structural views showing valves having a structure that one sheet ring 99 is formed as one body by the first sheet ring 92 and the second sheet ring 93 of the valve apparatus shown in Fig. 20 and that a position in which the fluid is flown into a lower outflow direction changing chamber from a gap generated between the second plug 91 and the sheet ring 99 is decentered from the center position of the lower outflow direction changing chamber.  In Fig. 21, the same parts or similar parts as of Fig. 20 have the same reference numerals, thereby omitting repetitious description.  In this figure, a reference numeral 100 denotes a lower outflow direction changing chamber.  The sheet ring 99 is fixed to the valve main body 81 by screws in similar to the first sheet ring 92 and the second sheet ring 93 of the valve apparatus shown in Fig. 20.  In the valve apparatus using the sheet ring 71 shown<br><br>
In Fig. 13 as a sheet ring 99, If the upper cover 85 is removed from the valve main body 81, the first plug 90 and the sheet ring 71 can be seen from the upper side easily. Owing to this, when the sheet ring 71 is set to the valve main body 81; the first plug 90 and the second plug 91 and the sheet ring 71 are changed; or position relation between the sheet ring 71 and the first plug 90 and the second plug 91 is adjusted, the upper cover 85 is removed from the valve main body 81; a state in which the sheet ring 71 is screwed into the valve main body 81 from the upper side is adjusted; a vertical install position of the sheet ring 71 with reference to the valve main body 81 is changed; and a closely attached state between the first plug 90 and the first sheet ring organizing portion 71a and a closely attached state between the second plug 9 and the second sheet ring organizing portion 71b can be adjusted to an optimum state simultaneously.  Particularly, comparing with the valve apparatus in which the first sheet ring 92 and the second sheet ring 93 are respectively produced and set to the valve main body 81, since the first sheet ring organizing portion 71a and the second sheet ring organizing portion 71b are formed as one body in the present valve apparatus, the gap between the first sheet ring organizing portion 71a and the second sheet ring organizing portion 71b is constant, so that the first sheet ring organizing portion 71a and the second sheet ring organizing portion 71b can be adjusted at the same time.<br>
In addition, in the embodiment 9 described above.<br><br>
either the male screw portion 71e or the male screw portion 71f can be omitted in the sheet ring 71, and a female screw to be engaged with such omitted male screw portion of the valve main body 81 can be also omitted, as well as in this structure, the production of the sheet ring 71 can be made simple and easy in comparing with the case that the male screw portion 71e and the male screw portion 71f are formed.  Furthermore, although the embodiment 9 described above is shown as the structure that the upper cover 85 is removed from the valve main body 81, and the sheet ring 71 is screwed from the upper side into the inside of the valve main body 81, the structure may be made such that the lower cover 84 is removed from the valve main body 81, and the sheet ring 71 is screwed from the lower side into the inside of the valve main body 81.  Also in the valve apparatus using such sheet ring 71, the flowing fluid flown into the upper outflow direction changing chamber 88 which is moved up via the gap generated between the first plug 90 and the first sheet ring organizing portion 71a is flown along with the side wall of the upper outflow direction changing chamber 88, as well as along with the streamlined concave surface 98 which is continue to the side wall, and the flowing direction of the fluid is changed at the upper outflow direction changing chamber 88, as well as is flown to lower direction at this time in the upper outflow direction changing chamber 88, thereby sending to the lower flowing side from the outflow opening 83.  At this time, since the streamlined concave surface 98 has continuously<br><br>
connected to the curved surface which belongs to the side wall of the upper outflow direction changing chamber 88, the separating eddy or flowing confusion which are easy to generate when the flowing direction of the fluid is changed in the upper outflow direction changing chamber 88 is restrained, so that an effective flowing is generated.<br>
On the other hand, the flowing fluid flown into the lower outflow direction changing chamber 100 which is moved up via the gap generated between the second plug 91 and the second sheet ring organizing portion 71b is toward the upper side at this time in the lower outflow direction changing chamber 100, and sent to the lower flowing side from the outflow opening 83 of the fluid.  In this case, if the bottom of the lower cover 84 forming one part of the inside surface of the lower outflow direction changing chamber 100 is made as a concave surface 98 having a streamlined shape for reducing a resistance when the fluid is flown in similar to the case of the upper cover 85, the separating eddy or flowing confusion which are easy to generate when the flowing direction of the fluid is changed in the lower outflow direction changing chamber 100 is restrained, so that an effective flowing is generated.<br>
Moreover, in the valve apparatus using the sheet ring 72 shown in Fig. 14 as a sheet ring 99, if the upper cover 85 is removed from the valve main body 81, the first plug 90 and the sheet ring 72 can be seen from the upper side easily.  Owing to this, when the sheet ring 72 is set to the valve main body 81; the first plug 90 and the second<br><br>
plug 91 and the sheet ring 72 are changed; or position relation between the sheet ring 72 and the first plug 90 and the second plug 91 is adjusted, the upper cover 85 is removed from the valve main body 81; a state in which the sheet ring 72 is screwed into the valve main body 81 from the upper side is adjusted; a vertical install position of the sheet ring 72 with reference to the valve main body 81 is changed; and a closely attached state between the first plug 90 and the first sheet ring organizing portion 72a and a closely attached state between the second plug 9 and the second sheet ring organizing portion 72b can be adjusted to an optimum state simultaneously.  Since the first sheet ring organizing portion 72a and the second sheet ring organizing portion 72b are formed as one body in the present valve apparatus, the gap between the first sheet ring organizing portion 72a and the second sheet ring organizing portion 72b is constant, so that the first sheet ring organizing portion 72a and the second sheet ring organizing portion 72b can be adjusted by one operation at the same time.  In addition, since a plurality of holes 72d which functions as a defuser are formed to the connecting portion 72c for connecting the first sheet ring organizing portion 72a and the second sheet ring organizing portion 72b, a kinetic energy of the fluid flown from the upper side is changed into a pressure energy by the plurality of holes 72d, so that the flowing of the fluid flown to the lower side via the gap between the sheet ring and the plug can be made smooth.<br><br>
In addition, In the embodiment described above, either the male screw portion 72e or the male screw portion 72f can be omitted, and a female screw to be engaged with such omitted male screw portion of the valve main body 81 can be also omitted, as well as in this structure, the production of the sheet ring 72 can be made simple and easy in comparing with the case that the male screw portion 72e and the male screw portion 72f are formed.  Furthermore, although the embodiment described above is shown as the structure that the upper cover 85 Is removed from the valve main body 81, and the sheet ring 72 is screwed from the upper side into the inside of the valve main body 81, the structure may be made such that the lower cover 84 is removed from the valve main body 81, and the sheet ring 72 is screwed from the lower side into the inside of the valve main body 81.<br>
Also in the valve apparatus using such sheet ring 72, the flowing fluid flown into the upper outflow direction changing chamber 88 which is moved up via the gap generated between the first plug 90 and the first sheet ring organizing portion 72a is flown along with the side wall of the upper outflow direction changing chamber 88, as well as along with the streamlined concave surface 98 which is continue to the side wall, and the flowing direction of the fluid is changed at the upper outflow direction changing chamber 88, as well as is flown to lower direction at this time in the upper outflow direction changing chamber 88, thereby sending to the lower flowing side from the outflow<br><br>
opening 83.  At this time, since the streamlined concave surface 98 has continuously connected to the curved surface which belongs to the side wall of the upper outflow direction changing chamber 88, the separating eddy or flowing confusion which are easy to generate when the flowing direction of the fluid is changed in the upper outflow direction changing chamber 88 is restrained, so that an effective flowing is generated.  On the other hand, the flowing fluid flown into the lower outflow direction changing chamber 100 which is moved up via the gap generated between the second plug 91 and the second sheet ring organizing portion 72b is toward the upper side at this time in the lower outflow direction changing chamber 100, and sent to the lower flowing side from the outflow opening 83 of the fluid.  In this case, if the bottom of the lower cover 84 forming one part of the inside surface of the lower outflow direction changing chamber 100 is made as a concave surface 98 having a streamlined shape for reducing a resistance when the fluid is flown in similar to the case of the upper cover 85, the separating eddy or flowing confusion which are easy to generate when the flowing direction of the fluid is changed in the lower outflow direction changing chamber 100 is restrained, so that an effective flowing is generated.<br>
Moreover, in the valve apparatus using the sheet ring 73 shown in Fig. 15 as a sheet ring 99, if the upper cover 85 is removed from the valve main body 81, the first plug 90 and the sheet ring 73 can be seen from the upper side<br><br>
easily.  Owing to this, when the sheet ring 73 is set to the valve main body 81; the first plug 90 and the second plug 91 and the sheet ring 73 are changed; or position relation between the sheet ring 73 and the first plug 90 and the second plug 91 is adjusted, the upper cover 85 is removed from the valve main body 81; a state In which the sheet ring 73 is screwed into the valve main body 81 from the upper side is adjusted; a vertical Install position of the sheet ring 73 with reference to the valve main body 81 is changed; and a closely attached state between the first plug 90 and the first sheet ring organizing portion 73a and a closely attached state between the second plug 9 and the second sheet ring organizing portion 73b can be adjusted to an optimum state simultaneously.  Particularly, comparing with the valve apparatus in which the first sheet ring 92 and the second sheet ring 93 are respectively produced and set to the valve main body 81, since the first sheet ring organizing portion 73a and the second sheet ring organizing portion 73b are formed as one body in the present valve apparatus, the gap between the first sheet ring organizing portion 73a and the second sheet ring organizing portion 73b is constant, so that the first sheet ring organizing portion 73a and the second sheet ring organizing portion 73b can be adjusted by one operation at the same time.<br>
In addition, in the embodiment described above, either the male screw portion 73e or the male screw portion 73f can be omitted, and a female screw to be engaged with such omitted male screw portion of the valve main body 81<br><br>
can be also omitted, as well as in this structure, the production of the sheet ring 73 can be made simple and easy in comparing with the case that the male screw portion 73e and the male screw portion 73f are formed.  Furthermore, although the embodiment described above is shown as the structure that the upper cover 85 is removed from the valve main body 81, and the sheet ring 73 is screwed from the upper side into the inside of the valve main body 81, the structure may be made such that the lower cover 84 is removed from the valve main body 81, and the sheet ring 73 is screwed from the lower side into the inside of the valve main body 81.<br>
Also in the valve apparatus using such sheet ring 73, the flowing fluid flown into the upper outflow direction changing chamber 88 which is moved up via the gap generated between the first plug 90 and the first sheet ring organizing portion 73a is flown along with the side wall of the upper outflow direction changing chamber 88, as well as along with the streamlined concave surface 98 which is continue to the side wall, and the flowing direction of the fluid is changed at the upper outflow direction changing chamber 88, as well as is flown to lower direction at this time in the upper outflow direction changing chamber 88, thereby sending to the lower flowing side from the outflow opening 83.  At this time, since the streamlined concave surface 98 has continuously connected to the curved surface which belongs to the side wall of the upper outflow direction changing chamber 88, the separating eddy or<br><br>
flowing confusion which are easy to generate when the flowing direction of the fluid is changed in the upper outflow direction changing chamber 88 is restrained, so that an effective flowing is generated.  On the other hand, the flowing fluid flown into the lower outflow direction changing chamber 100 which is moved up via the gap generated between the second plug 91 and the second sheet ring organizing portion 73b is toward the upper side at this time in the lower outflow direction changing chamber 100, and sent to the lower flowing side from the outflow opening 83 of the fluid.  In this case, if the bottom of the lower cover 84 forming one part of the inside surface of the lower outflow direction changing chamber 100 is made as a concave surface 98 having a streamlined shape for reducing a resistance when the fluid is flown in similar to the case of the upper cover 85, the separating eddy or flowing confusion which are easy to generate when the flowing direction of the fluid is changed in the lower outflow direction changing chamber 100 is restrained, so that an effective flowing is generated.<br>

A reference numeral 108 denotes an outflow direction changing chamber which is connected with the outflow opening 103 of the fluid, 110 represents a plug (upper plug). 111 denotes a sheet ring for performing the stop of the flowing path between the outflow changing chamber 108 and the inflow opening 102 of the fluid by closely attaching with the plug 110, 114 shows a plug driving rod (valve shaft) connected with the plug upper end surface.  Because a diaphragm operational device which is not shown shifts the plug 110 vertically in the upper direction, the upper flowing side and the lower flowing side are connected by generating a gap between the plug and the sheet ring 111,<br>
A reference numeral 105 denotes a concave surface having a streamlined shape which is formed at the bottom of the upper cover 104 making an upper inside surface of the outflow direction changing chamber 108.  This concave surface 105 having the streamlined shape is formed so as to continuously connect with a curved surface which belongs to a side wall of the outflow direction changing chamber 108, and has a continuity with reference to the curved surface which the side wall has, such that a disorder generated when the flowing direction of the fluid flown from the gap generated between the plug 110 and the sheet ring 111 is changed into the direction to the outflow opening 103 along<br><br>
with the side wall of the outflow direction changing chamber 108 is restrained.<br>
Next, the description will be made of the operations.<br>
In this valve, the plug 110 is vertically pushed to the lower direction by a push spring located in the diaphragm operational device generally, and as a result of this, the plug 110 is closely attached to the sheet ring 111, thus the gap between the outflow direction changing chamber 108 and the inflow opening 102 is made as closed condition.  In this situation, if the diaphragm operational device is operated, an upper direction force is generated vertically, and the plug 110 is vertically shifted in the upper direction via the plug driving rod 114.  As a result of this, gap is generated between the plug 110 and the sheet ring 111, thereby forming a flowing path with the interval between the outflow direction changing chamber 108 and the inflow opening 102 being connected.  In this case, the gap size between the plug 110 and the sheet ring 111 can be controlled by the diaphragm operational device, and is adjusted flexibly as a valve opening degree.<br>
Moreover, the flowing fluid flown into the outflow direction changing chamber 108 which is moved up via the gap generated between the plug 110 and the sheet ring 111 is flown along with the side wall of the outflow direction changing chamber 108, as well as along with the streamlined concave surface 105 which is continue to the side wall, then the flowing direction of the fluid is changed at the outflow direction changing chamber 108, as well as is flown<br><br>
to lower direction at this time In the outflow direction changing chamber 108, thereby sending to the lower flowing side from the outflow opening 103.  At this time, since the streamlined concave surface 105 has continuously connected to the curved surface which forms the side wall of the outflow direction changing chamber 108, the separating eddy or flowing confusion which are easy to generate when the flowing direction of the fluid is changed in the outflow direction changing chamber 108 is restrained, so that an effective flowing Is generated.<br>

Fig. 25 is a sectional view of a valve apparatus according to the twelfth embodiment of the present invention.  In the figure, a reference numeral 121 denotes a valve main body in which a plug guide attaching hole 121a is provided at the bottom thereof as a screw hole.  A reference numeral 122 illustrates an inflow opening, 123 shows an outflow opening of the valve main body 121, 124 represents an upper cover fixed to the upper portion of the valve main body 121 by stud bolts 125 and hexagon nuts 126, and a gasket (not shown) is provided between the valve main body 121 and the upper cover 124.  A reference numeral 124a indicates a stem insert hole for inserting a stem 130 which will be mentioned hereinafter, 127a and 127b denote connecting holes for connecting the inflow opening 2 and the outflow opening 3.<br>
Reference numerals 128a and 128b illustrate sheet rings provided to the connecting holes 127a and 127b via a gasket 129 so as to make contactable with a plug 133 which will be mentioned hereinafter.<br>
A reference numeral 130 shows a stem (valve shaft) which is connected with a driving device like a diaphragm motor or so (not shown) to shift the aforementioned plug 133 in the vertical or horizontal direction, and is inserted into the stem insert hole 124a of the upper cover 124 via a gland packing 131 and a guide bush 132.<br>
A reference numeral 133 represents a plug that the upper portion is connected to the stem 130 so as to move freely in the vertical direction and that is formed so as<br><br>
to be engageable with the sheet rings 128a and 128b, whereby the Inflow opening 2 and the outflow opening 3 are connected by opening and closing the connecting holes 127a and 127b.<br>
A reference numeral 134 indicates a guide hole provided at the bottom of the plug 133, and is formed such that a portion of the plug guide 135 which will be mentioned hereinafter and which is provided to the valve main body 121 is inserted thereinto so as to freely move. Accordingly, the depth of the guide hole 134 is set such that the plug 133 is not slip out in consideration of the length of stroke on moving of the plug 133, and the inside diameter of the guide hole 134 is set in consideration of the engagement with a plug guide 135.<br>
The reference numeral 135 denotes a plug guide having a rod shape including a male screw portion 135a which is possible to screw into the plug guide attaching hole 121a of the valve main body 121 and a guide portion 135b which is formed so as to make engageable with the guide hole 134 of the plug 133.  In addition, the bottom of the male screw portion 135a is processed as a figure in which a tool like a spanner or so can be used, for instance, a hexagonal shape.<br>
Further, in this plug guide 135, an antiseismic material, a heat-resistant material, or a high Intensity material against to vibration due to the fluid can be used in accordance with the character of the fluid.<br>
In addition, a predetermined sealing is performed to<br><br>
such screw portions so as not to leak the fluid.<br>
The description will be given of the operations next. The stem 130 is moved up and down with a predetermined stroke set by a driving device (not shown), therefore the plug 133 is moved up and down.  In this case, when the plug 133 is engaged with the sheet rings 12:8a and 128b, the inflow opening 122 and the outflow opening 123 are not connected through, and when the plug 133 is not engaged with the sheet rings 128a and 128b, the inflow opening 122 and the outflow opening 123 are connected therethrough.<br>
Moreover, the guide portion 135b of the plug guide 135 is inserted into the guide hole 134 of the plug 133, and the plug 133 is slided with reference to the plug guide 135, therefore, horizontal directional movement is limited. Accordingly, the engagement between the plug 133 and the sheet rings 128a and 128b is suitably performed, and the fluid leak when the plug 133 is closed can be effectively prevented.<br>
In the case that the plug guide 135 is damaged by the vibration and corrosion therefore required to change, or that the maintenance thereof, only the plug guide 135 is changed, with the male screw portion 135a of the plug guide 135 being screwed thereinto, or loosened.<br>
As described above, according to the embodiment 12, since the plug guide 135 is provided, the engagement between the plug 133 and the sheet rings 128a and 128b is suitably performed, and the fluid leak when the plug 133 is closed can be effectively prevented, as well as, in the<br><br>
case that the plug guide 135 is damaged by the vibration and corrosion therefore required to change, or that the maintenance thereof, only the plug guide 135 can be changed, with the male screw portion 135a of the plug guide 135 being screwed thereinto, or loosened, whereby there is an effect that a valve apparatus having superior cost/performance can be provided.<br>
Moreover, since the plug guide 135 which is directly fixable to the valve main body 121 is adopted, the lower cover which is required in the conventional one becomes needless, so that the number of parts can be reduced and the projecting amount of the bottom of the valve main body 121 becomes small, whereby there is an effect that the apparatus can be minimized as a whole, wherein vibration can be reduced by the part of such minimization.<br>
In addition, since the projecting amount of the bottom of the valve main body 121 becomes small, an enough working space at the lower portion can be obtained after the valve apparatus is Installed, so that there is an effect that the maintenance operation of the plug guide 135 and so on can be easily performed.<br>
EMBODIMENT 13<br>
Fig. 26 is a sectional view of a valve apparatus according to the thirteenth embodiment of the present invention.  In the figure, a reference numeral 138 denotes a one-body sheet ring which is contactable with the plug 133, and has a through hole 138a.<br><br>
A reference numeral 140 Illustrates a plug guide having a rod shape which is formed so as to be engageable with the guide hole 134 of the plug 133, and is engaged into a plug guide attaching hole 141 provided to the valve main body 121 via a gasket 142.<br>
A reference numeral 140a shows a bypass hole having an opening portion at the upper surface of the plug guide 140 and at the side surface of the plug guide 140, which is not inserted into the guide hole 134 of the plug 133.  In other words, this bypass hole 140a is for making a smooth downward operation of the plug 133 when the plug 133 is moved down, by discharging the fluid maintained in the space formed of the upper surface of the plug guide 140 and the guide hole 134 to the out of the space, thus by removing the fluid as a pressure resistance at the downward operation.<br>
A reference numeral 143 represents a lower cover fixed to the bottom of the valve main body 121 by hexagonal bolts 144, to push and fix the plug guide 140.<br>
The description will be given of the operations next.<br>
The stem 130 is moved up and down with a predetermined stroke set by a driving device (not shown), therefore the plug 133 is moved up and down.  In this case, when the plug 133 is engaged with the one-body sheet ring 138, the inflow opening 2 and the outflow opening 3 are not connected through, and when the plug 133 is not engaged with the one-body sheet ring 138, the inflow opening 2 and the outflow opening 3 are connected therethrough.<br><br>
Moreover, one portion of the plug guide 140 is inserted into the guide hole 134 of the plug 133, and the plug 133 is sllded with reference to the plug guide 140, therefore, horizontal directional movement is limited. Accordingly, the engagement between the plug 133 and the one-body sheet ring 138 is suitably performed, and the fluid leak when the plug 133 is closed can be effectively prevented.<br>
Furthermore, when the plug 133 is moved down, the fluid maintained at the space formed by the upper surface of the plug guide 140 and the guide hole 134 is discharged to the space via the bypass hole 140a, thus the fluid as a pressure resistance at the downward operation is removed.<br>
As described above, according to the embodiment 13, since the plug guide 140 is provided, the engagement between the plug 133 and the one-body sheet ring 138 is suitably performed, and the fluid leak when the plug 133 is closed can be effectively prevented, as well as, in the case that the plug guide 140 is damaged by the vibration and corrosion therefore required to change, or that the maintenance thereof, only the plug guide 140 can be changed, with the lower cover 143 being removed, whereby there is an effect that a valve apparatus having superior cost/performance can be provided.<br>
In addition, since the guide hole is not required to the lower cover 143, a thin lower cover can be adopted thereto, and the projecting amount of the bottom portion of the valve main body 121 becomes small, whereby there is an<br><br>
effect that the apparatus can be minimized as a whole.<br>
Further, since the projecting amount of the bottom of the valve main body 121 becomes small, an enough working space at the lower portion can be obtained after the valve apparatus is installed, so that there is an effect that the maintenance operation of the plug guide 140 and so on can be easily performed.<br>
Moreover, since a bypass hole 140a is provided to the plug guide 140, when the plug 133 is moved down, the fluid maintained in the space formed of the upper surface of the plug guide 140 and the guide hole 134 to the out of the space can be discharged, thus the fluid as a pressure resistance at the downward operation can be easily discharged, whereby there is also an effect that the smooth downward operation of the plug 133 can be obtained.<br>
Here, although the embodiment 13 described above shows as one that the plug guide 140 and the lower cover 143 are individually formed, the plug guide 140 and the lower cover 143 may be formed as one body by welding, or a part of the plug guide 140 may be made as a member having a function of the lower cover 143, by forming as a figure like the lower cover 143.<br>
EMBODIMENT 14<br>
Fig. 27 is a sectional view showing a valve apparatus according to the fourteenth embodiment of the present invention, and in this figure, a reference numeral 145 denotes a plug guide having a rod shape formed so as to be<br><br>
engageable with the guide hole of the plug 133, as well as is engaged in the guide attaching hole 121 via the gasket 142.<br>
A reference numeral 146 illustrates a bypass hole provided to the plug 133 to connect between the inside and outside of the guide hole 134 of the plug 133.  In other words, this bypass hole 146 is for making a smooth downward operation of the plug 133 when the plug 133 is moved down, by discharging the fluid maintained in the space formed of the upper surface of the plug guide 145 and the guide hole 134 to the out of the space, thus by removing the fluid as a pressure resistance at the downward operation.<br>
Namely, although the bypass hole is provided to the plug guide 140 to discharge such fluid in the embodiment 13, the embodiment 14 is different in a point that the bypass hole is provided to the plug 133.  Other structure is the same as the embodiment 13, and the same parts have the same references thereby omitting the description.<br>
Next, the operation will be described.<br>
The operation for moving the plug 133 and a point that the fluid flowing when the plug 133 is closed is effectively prevented are the same as the case of the embodiment 13.<br>
Different part is a point that the fluid maintained at the space formed by the upper surface of the plug guide 145 and the guide hole 134 when the plug 133 is moved down is discharged to the out of space via the bypass hole 146, and that the fluid as a pressure resistance when moving<br><br>
down is discharged.<br>
As described above, according to the embodiment 14, since the plug guide 145 is provided, the same effect as the embodiment 13 can be obtained, and since the bypass hole 146 is provided to the plug 133, when the plug 133 is moved down, the fluid maintained in the space formed of the upper surface of the plug guide 145 and the guide hole 134 to the out of the space can be discharged, thus the fluid as a pressure resistance at the downward operation can be easily discharged, whereby there is also an effect that the smooth downward operation of the plug 133 can be obtained.<br>
EMBODIMENT 15<br>
In the embodiment 15, a lubricant which is not shown is provided for reducing the resistance at the movement to a surface (engaging surface) of the plug guide portion 135 (Fig. 25), an inserting portion surface (engaging surface) of the plug guide 140 (Fig. 26) and the plug guide 145 (Fig. 27) to the guide hole 134, or the engaging surface of the guide hole 134, in the case of the embodiment 12 to the embodiment 14.  In other words, there is a feature that a lubricant such as PTFE or so is suffused to the above-mentioned portion for example.<br>
In addition, it may have a feature that the above-mentioned lubricant is suffused on both the plug guide 135 and the guide hole 134.<br>
The operation will be described next.<br>
The operation is the same as the cases of the<br><br>
embodiment 12 to the embodiment 14, and the different point is that the since the resistance of the guide hole 134 can be reduced by the lubricant suffused on the plug guides 135, 140 and 145, the movement of the plug 133 becomes further smooth.<br>
As mentioned above, according to the embodiment 15, since a lubricant such as Teflon or so is suffused on the plug guide 135, 140 or 145 in the embodiment 12 to the embodiment 14, the same effect as the cases of the embodiment 12 to the embodiment 14, as well as since the resistance of the guide hole 134 and the plug guide 135, 140 or 145 is reduced, and the movement of the plug 133 can be more smooth, the effect can be obtained that the damage by the resistance of the plug guide 135, 140 or 145, and guide hole 134 can be effectively prevented.<br>
EMBODIMENT 16<br>
Fig. 28 is a sectional view showing a valve apparatus according to the embodiment 16 of this invention, and the same references are given to the same or similar parts as the embodiment 14 shown in Fig. 26, thereby omitting the repetitious description.<br>
In the figure, a reference numeral 151 is a plurality of fluid escaping grooves formed between the inner surface of the plug guide hole 134 in the lower plug 133b of the plug 133 and the outer surface of the guide shaft 140, and in this embodiment 16, these fluid escaping groove 151 are formed of four concave grooves made along with the guide<br><br>
shaft 140 in the longitudinal direction as shown in Fig. 30, thus the space 134a of the plug guide hole 134 and a lower outflow direction changing chamber 152 are connected as shown in Fig. 28 and Fig. 29.<br>
A reference numeral 153 denotes an engaging convex portion which is projecting to the Inside of the plug guide hole 134, and which is provided to the lower plug 133b, and this projecting convex portion 153 is engaged into one of the four fluid escaping groove 151, to allow the open/close movement in the axis direction of the plug 133 (up/down movement in the figure) in the engaged state, as well as to prevent the rotation of the plug 133.  In the embodiment 16, the engaging convex portion 153 is formed of the bolt which is detachablly provided to the lower portion of the plug 133 from the outside.<br>
Next the operation will be described.<br>
The flowing fluid when the plug 133 is moved and opened is the same as the conventional one, and even if the force due to the flowing confusion is received by the plug 133, the plug 133 is not rotated by engaging of the fluid escaping groove 151 and the engaging convex portion 153, so that the twisting of a valve shaft portion 156 and the plug stem 130 or so by the rotation of the plug 133 is not occurred, therefore, the connecting portion of the valve portion 156 and the plug stem 130 or the operational system are not damaged.<br>
Next, when the plug 133 is moved down, the fluid maintained in the space portion 134a of the plug guide hole<br><br>
134 is escaped into the lower outflow direction changing chamber 152 via the fluid escaping groove 151 in the axis direction of the guide shaft 140, so that there is no confusion of the fluid around the lower plug 133b due to the escaping fluid.<br>
In addition, since the guide shaft 140 has a plurality of fluid escaping groove 151 (four grooves in the figure), even if the one fluid escaping groove 151 is clogged up by a substance like a solid matter or slurry, other fluid escaping groove 151 can be functioned as a bypass hole for taking the maintained fluid out.<br>
Furthermore, when the fluid escaping groove 151 in which the engaging convex portion 153 is engaged is damaged by the engagement with the engaging convex portion 153, it is possible to perform that the other fluid escaping groove 151 is engaged with the engaging convex portion 153, with the guide shaft 140 being removed with the lower cover 143, without taking the whole valve apparatus apart to pieces.<br>
Moreover, when the slurry or so of the fluid is stuck to the inside surface of the plug guide hole 134, if the plug 133 is rotated with the engagement of the engaging convex portion 153 and the fluid escaping groove 151 being released, the slurry or so can be removed by an edge portion of opening end of each fluid escaping groove 151 being functioned as a scraper.<br>

Fig. 31 is a transverse sectional view of a main body<br><br>
according to the seventeenth embodiment of the present invention.  Although the detachable bolts are adopted as the engaging convex portion 153 in the embodiment 16, the engaging convex portion 153 is formed to the inside surface of the plug guide hole 134 as one body in the embodiment 17.  Therefore, in this embodiment 17, the same operational effect can be obtained as the embodiment 16 except for that the edge portion of the opening end of the fluid escaping groove 151 is functioned as the scraper.<br>

Therefore, according to the embodiment 18, the maintained fluid of the space portion 134a of the plug guide hole 134 shown in Fig. 28 can be escaped by one fluid escaping groove 151 along with the guide shaft 140, and the rotation of the guide shaft 140 can be prevented by the engagement of the engaging convex portion 153 and the engaging groove 154.<br><br>
EMBODIMENT 19<br>
Fig. 33 is a transverse sectional view of a main body according to the nineteenth embodiment of the present invention.  Although the four fluid escaping grooves 151 are provided at the outer surface of the guide shaft 140 and the engaging convex portion 153 is provided at the side of the lower plug 133b respectively in the above-mentioned embodiment 16, oppositely the four fluid escaping grooves 151 are provided at the Inside surface of the plug guide hole 134 of the lower plug 133b, and the engaging convex portion 153 is provided to one of the Inside surface of the plug guide hole 134 of the lower plug 133b, as well as this engaging convex portion 153 Is engaged into one of the four fluid escaping grooves 151 in the embodiment 19.<br>

plug guide hole 134 by engaging each of the side end portions of the crossing shape of the guide shaft 140 into these engaging grooves 151.<br>
Therefore, the sectional shape is different between a circular inside surface of the plug guide hole 134 and the outside surface of the guide shaft 140, and the fluid escaping grooves 151 can also be formed therebetween by making the plug guide hole 134 different as the sectional shape from that of the guide shaft 140, as well as the same operational effect can be obtained as the embodiment 16 except for that the edge portion of the opening end of the fluid escaping groove 151 is functioned as the scraper.<br>

Therefore, also in the embodiment 21, the sectional shape is different between a circular inside surface of the plug guide hole 134 and the outside surface of the guide shaft 140, and thus the plurality of fluid escaping grooves<br><br>
151 can be formed in the plug guide hole 134 by making the both different as the sectional shape each other, as well as the same operational effect can be obtained as the embodiment 20.<br>
EMBODIMENT 2 2<br>

has smaller value than the amuunL ui mc uppci (-UIICUL path, the ratio of the amount of both the upper and lower flowing can be set as an optimum value, so that there is an effect that the unbalance power can be maintained as a small value having one direction in all over the lift amount.<br>
According to the valve apparatus of the second aspect, since the rate of flowing in the upper current path and the lower current path is 1.0 : 0.7 to 1.0 : 0.9 when the upper and lower plug shapes are approximately the same, the ratio of the amount of both the upper and lower flowing can be set as an optimum value, so that there is an effect that the unbalance power can be maintained as a small value having one direction in all over the lift amount.<br>
According to the valve apparatus of the third aspect, since the sectional area of the upper current path is formed larger than sectional area of the lower current path, the flow of the upper current path : the flow of the lower current path = 1.0 : 0.7 to 1.0 : 0.9 is realized by the difference of the sectional area, and the ratio of the amount of both the upper and lower flowing can be set as an optimum value, so that there is an effect that the unbalance power can be maintained as a small value having one direction in all over the lift amount.<br>
According to the valve apparatus of the fourth aspect, since the upper plug and the lower plug are provided such that the center line of a path at the inflow side is positioned lower than the symmetrical center line<br>
