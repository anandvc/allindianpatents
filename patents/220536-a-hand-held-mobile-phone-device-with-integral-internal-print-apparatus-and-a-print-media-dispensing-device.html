In the preferred embodiment illustrated, there has provided a mobile phone having an internal printer which includes a separately detachable printhead and ink supply module. The printer phone can be produced at or close to a standard size phone for any<br><br>
system including PHS, GSM and GPRS, thereby conferring a higher level of convenience during operation.<br>
Turning initially to Fig. 1, there is illustrated the preferred embodiment 1 in the form of a PHS phone and which in many ways looks like and includes the features of a conventional mobile phone of this type including an ear piece 2, microphone 3, aerial 4, loud speaker 5, a series of push buttons 6 and a preferably color LCD screen 7 for the display of information. Also included is a battery 8 as shown in Fig. 4.<br>
The phone 1 can optionally be equipped with a camera device 10 comprising lenses 11 and associated CCD chip or CMOS sensor 12. The CCD or CMOS sensor enables the device to store images on demand, so that the phone can effectively act as a camera device for the printing out of images, or for their capture and forwarding across a mobile phone network. The operation of the relevant part of the internal control electronics can be substantially as set out in the applicant's earlier PCT application WO 99/04551 entitled "A replenishable one time use camera system" the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference. In other embodiments, the camera device may also be configured to enable video conferencing by facilitating simultaneous image processing during phone transmission. A camera function that is mounted for selective movable positioning on the phone device may be useful for this purpose. For example, it may be rotatable between a forward facing camera orientation and a rearward facing video conferencing orientation.<br>
The printer apparatus is shown generally at 15 and comprises a printhead and ink supply module 16 including a printhead 17, an ink supply/distribution unit 18 and a print media feed apparatus 20. The feed apparatus is of a conventional form including a motor 21 with associated gear train 22 which drive a series of feed rollers 23.<br>
The packaging of the printer apparatus 15 is best shown in Figs. 5, 6 and 9. In this regard the printer phone 1 is constructed around a rigid chassis molding 25. The chassis is adapted to slideably receive and retain the printhead and ink supply module 16 by means of retaining flanges 26 provided on the outer casing of the printhead module 16 which cooperate with under cut channels 27 provided on the chassis molding.<br>
The full operation of the printer apparatus 15 is best illustrated in Fig. 9. In use print media 30, preferably in the form of business card sized paper or card sheets, is fed in through an entry slot 31 provided in the external phone casing 32. This can be done.<br><br>
1<br>
manually or via a dispenser as described hereafter. The card 30 is then picked up by the powered entry feed rollers 23 and delivered to the printhead module 16. The printhead and ink supply module can be substantially the same as that disclosed in Australian Provisional Patent No. PP6534 entitled "Micromechanical Device and Method (IJ46A)" filed 16 October, 1998, the contents of which are also hereby incorporated by cross-reference. In such a device, the printhead is in the form of an elongate printhead chip that extends the full length of the print media pathway, so as to print the full width of the print media in a single pass without the need for any printhead traversing mechanisms.<br>
In this particular preferred embodiment, the printhead and ink module is formed as a sealed unit which is replaced in its totality after a predetermined amount of usage. The detailed structure of the ink supply and printhead module is shown more clearly in Fig. 8. The ink supply/distribution unit 18 is of a molded multi-part structure including a cover 35, a macro channel molding 36 defining four separate ink supply chambers 37-40 having therein optional flow control baffles 41. Connected with converging outlets of the macro channel molding 36 is a micro-molding 42 which defines similarly converging ink flow nozzles 43 that accurately direct the ink to minute ink supply inlets on the rear of the printhead 17. Optionally, an ink filter 44 is provided between the two moldings. A capping device 47 is also provided as part of the module for sealing and protecting the nozzle outlets when the printer head is not in use. It is estimated that the ink supply will on average be sufficient for printing approximately 1000 pages at 15% coverage of black or 100 photos of 50% coverage of CMYK. An expanded technical description of the printhead and ink supply module can be found in the aforementioned provisional patent specification PP6534 and associated applications.<br>
The mobile phone system can be operated under the control of a series of one or more application specific integrated circuits (ASICS) which incorporate the usual mobile phone capabilities in addition to camera and image processing capabilities. An adaptation of the system outlined in PCT Patent Application PCT/AU98/00544 filed by the present applicant (also incorporated herein by reference) can be utilised in the design of the ASIC. The electrical interconnections for the preferred embodiment is shown schematically as a block diagram in Fig. 16. Other system designs well known to those skilled in this field may also be used.<br><br>
Referring next to Figs. 11 to 15 there is illustrated a print media dispenser 50 configured for use with the PHS phone of the previous embodiments. The dispenser comprises a lower molding 51 that defines a media storage and dispensing region 52 and a cradle 53 which supports the printer phone 1 and aligns it with the outlet of the dispenser.<br>
The interactive operation of the print media dispenser with the phone 1 is best illustrated in Fig. 14. As can be seen, the dispenser 50 has a storage area 52 in which is disposed a quantity of print media in the form of business card sized paper or card sheets. These cards are supported on a metal base plate 55 which is sprung by means of opposed spring fingers 56 as shown in Fig. 15. In this manner, the card supply is constantly biased upwardly toward a media ejector mechanism 58. The ejector mechanism includes an ejector slider 59 which is operable upon manual sliding against a return spring 60 to pick up the top card and feed this out of the dispenser outlet 61 and into the media entry slot 31 on the phone 1. On release, the slider automatically returns to the home position to engage the next card ready for further loading.<br>
Desirably, the printer phone 1 and/or printhead and ink supply module 16 includes an authentication mechanism such as that outlined in the applicant's earlier PCT application no. PCT/AU98/00544 entitled "A camera with an internal printing system". This can be used to ensure not only that an authenticated approved consumable (such as the printhead and ink supply module) is used with the printer phone, but can also be used to store data on the relative usages of the consumable components such as the ink or the printhead itself and can optionally be used to set a predetermined usage for these items.<br>
As noted above, the phone device of the invention may be any kind of mobile phone that sends and receives signals in a manner which can be processed into a printable form. Further, while the preferred form described has a printhead and ink distribution unit which has an integrally formed and attached ink supply, the ink supply could be separate and optionally also separately replenishable.<br>
While the invention has been described with reference to specific examples, it will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the invention may be embodied in many other forms.<br><br><br><br><br>
