DESCRIPTION:<br>
The present invention relates to a noval herbal composition and its method of preparation for curing diseases like  HIV / AIDS/ and Cancer. The present invention also relates to a process for making the said novel herbal composition.<br>
In spite of extensive laboratory trials and rapid advances in the understanding of HIV/AIDS pathogenesis in the years following the identification of HIV, the pace Of discovery of an antiretroviral agent is less spectacular. Observations on the effects and adverse reaction of some drugs like Zidodudine, Dideoxycytidine. Dideoxyidnosine and others indicate the need for change in the clinical treatment strategy and development of a highly effective drug therapy. Particularly, since the virus develops resistance to drugs, the treatment of the prohibitive cost of antiretroviral drugs the treatment of opportunistic infections remains the only real choice open to a physician. Expecially in a Developing country like INDIA. It is good that certain behavioral habits like smoking, Addiction to alcohol, etc., are not linked with its manifestaion. Still it remains a global Problem.<br>
This present invention is process of herbal based drug preparation that can arrest the progress and cure HIV/AIDS and CANCER.<br>
NATURE OF THE VIRUS &amp; THE DISEASE:<br>
Once the HIV virus was infected in to the body, gradually it turns into AIDS. This day-by-day disturbs the functioning of all the organs i.e.GIT, Brain,Heart,Liver,Kidney, Lungs,Nervous System, etc.in the body and as a result the calories in the body deteriorate. Day -by-day the virus doubles, trebles, and multiplies in the body and results In malfunctioning of organs and the patient's body deteriorates. That is why none of the Patients are able save themselves from the dreadful disease.<br>
The person who is affected with HIV virus will have feverishness(malaise). This cannot Be cured with the usage of any stream of medicine i.e. Allopathic/Ayurveda/Homeo. Some doctors view and treat the patients bases on the CD4 count and also see that the immunity increases. Even though the patien looks healthy. The body heat remains the same since virus is not killed. In such a case the immunity gained, in the meanwhile,the weight may increase or decrease or decrease all of a sudden and the patient may die ultimately. All this is happening because the medicines are given to provide energy to the body. But not to remove the causative factor (i.e.HIV virus). The immunity gained is just an artificial one and will not stay long. Due to disturbed functioning of organs. Thereby the virus strengthens gradually. This is due to the very nature of the virus, Which develops resistance to drugs.<br>
Due to HIV virus almost all organs in the body are affected and deteriorates the strength(immunity) of the body. With the usage of these (Allopathic) medicines the Patient may get some immunity (artificial) in his body, bu are not useful to rebuild the<br><br>
Organs functionally, disturbed due to attack of virus.<br>
The present ivention is a drug by name AVALMIC-II, rebuilds the tissues (Cells) And develops the physiological activity of cells and purifies &amp; restores the blood. Due to one dreaded disease there may be a chance for occurance of associated Diseases. In such case, the drug goes into the organ and repairs the cells there and Makes to function normally.<br>
This herbal based drug is also an ideal therapy in all immunological disorders and Degenerative changes of tissues anywhere in the body, such as loss of weight, eachexia and promotes cerebral and neural activity.<br>
NOVELTY OF THE INVENTION:<br>
Ayurveda lays importance on the holistic approach both in the attempt to understand the Pathogenesis and treatment of diseases. Ayurveda considers cancer of any kind in any particular place or organ only as accumulation of proliferation or epithelial cell or tissues as the case may be in any area that becomes vulnerable to it due to the disturbed normalcy of normal immune system. Therefore, Ayurveda takes into consideration th eINTERNAL milieu of body and recommends treatment for the whole system and the local condition concurrently. In Ayurveda carcionoma and sarcoma are described as arbuda or valmeeka.<br>
Oncology is the study of Tumors. Neoplasia menas abnormalnew growth, which May be benign or malignant. Benign tumors represent the accumulations of cells which Have been transformed to reproduce in abnormal numbers but under circumstances Where they remain with in the tissue of origin. Malignant tumors are comprised of cells, Which are capable of invading adjacent tissues and leaving the tissue of origin to disseminate and form metastases.<br>
This present invention AVALMIC-II repairs and rebuilds the tissue structure in all immunological disorders including HIV/AIDS, Cancer and degenerative changes Of tissues anywhere in the body.<br>
This is a specially invented process through anubhuta yoga for preparing a Herbal based drug capsule with a unique combination of natural ingredients which Enhances the natural immunity of the body. It promotes and maintains the immune mechanism. So this invention of the herbal base is the drug of choice for HIV/AIDS And early malignanceies such as carcinoma, leukemia and early secondaries.<br>
The primary objective of the invention was to invent a novel herbal based drug For treatment of HIV/AIDS and CANCER.<br>
Another objective of the invention was to invent a herbal based drug which is very Effective drug therapy. Another objective of the invention was to invent a process for manufacturing Herbal based drug.<br><br>
Another objective of the invention was to invent a novel herbal based drug which is available at the affordable rate, does not have side effect and has long shelf life.<br>
Further objectives of the invention will be clear from the following description:<br>
Now the invention will be described in the following description in detail. The characteristic of the raw material and the proportion in which they are used in preparing the drug is given. The pricess of manufacturing the drug from the basic raw material is Given. The description finally explains various advantages of the invention.<br>
This invention describes the processes of making medicinal compound for human use in the treatment of dreaded diseases HIV/AIDS and Cancer diseases. The new herbo mineral preparation named AVALMIC -II is indicated for repair of the structure by destroying the virus and to promote physiological activity of the tissues and organs .It also purifies and restores the blood volume free from virus to develop immunity It also improves the production of erythrocytes and total count of R.B.C. and acts on the infective condition caused by non-specific and specific organisms.
