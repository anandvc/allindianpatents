				<td>The present invention relates to a battery having a case which houses therein a plurality of plates and a cover for covering an upper opening of said case and more particularly to a battery of the type in which cut-out portions are formed in corners of a cover and plate-like terminals are disposed within the said cut-out portions.<br>
A terminal structure of a battery is disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid Open No.57720/95. The said battery is provided with a case which houses therein a large number of plates and also provided with a cover which covers an upper opening of the case. The said cover is generally in the<br>
shape of quadrilateral in plan and is provided in the upper surface thereof with a plurality of electrolyte inlets arranged in a juxtaposed direction of the plates and a pair of cut-out recesses formed in corner portions of both ends of a side substantially parallel to the arrangement direction of the electrolyte inlets. [0003]<br>
Plate-like terminals are disposed respectively within the cut-out recesses and one end of each plate-like terminal is connected to a pole rod which extends from one of the plates and projects into the cut-out recess, while the opposite end thereof serves as a terminal connecting portion. [0004]<br>
The paired cut-out recesses are each formed long so as to get into the inner part toward the electrolyte inlets along a short side perpendicular to the juxtaposed direction of the plates out of the four sides of the cover. The pole rod projects to a position closer to the electrolyte inlets rather than the corner portion defined by short and long sides adjacent to each other. Each plate-like terminal is disposed long along the said short side and the terminal connecting portion thereof as its tip end portion is positioned in the said corner portion.  The<br>
pole rod and the terminal connecting portion are offset<br>
along the short side.<br>
[0005]<br>
By the expression "juxtaposed direction of the plates" is meant to arrange the plates in a large number at appropriate intervals so that their flat plate portions confront one another. The said direction is substantially the same as the direction orthogonal to the flat plate portions of the plates. Where the case and the cover are each formed generally in a rectangular shape in plan, the<br>
Â»<br>
direction in question is in many cases a direction approximately in parallel with the long sides of the rectangle. [0006]<br>
[Problems to be Solved by the Invention]<br>
In the conventional battery described above, as shown in phantom in Fig. 1, the offset direction of the pole rod and the terminal connecting portion is orthogonal to the short-side direction, i.e., the arrangement direction of the electrolyte inlets, so that due to this offset the width Wl at which the cut-out recess gets in toward the electrolyte inlets becomes larger. As a result, the space above the plates is restricted and becomes narrow, thus making electrolyte difficult to flow when<br>
pourted from the electrolyte inlets. Consequently, it becomes difficult to improve the electrolyte pouring efficiency which is the working efficiency in the electrolyte pouring work. [0007]<br>
Particularly, where there is adopted a method in which electrolyte is poured beforehand into the batteries in the battery manufacturing factory and then the batteries are shipped, it is desired to improve the aforesaid electrolyte pouring efficiency in order to enhance the<br>
overall production efficiency. [0008]<br>
Moreover, in the case of adopting such an offset structure, it is required that the pole rods be bent within the case in order to prevent the reduction in area of the plates, thus making the production so much difficult. [0009] [Means for Solving the Problems]<br>
According to the present invention, for the purpose of solving the above-mentioned problems, in a battery having a case which houses therein a plurality of plates and a cover for covering an upper opening of the case, the cover being generally in the shape of quadrilateral in plan and having a plurality of electrolyte inlets formed in a<br>
row in a juxtaposed direction of the plates, the cover further having a pair of cut-out recesses formed in corner portions of both ends of one side thereof parallel to the arrangement direction of the electrolyte inlets, with plate-like terminals being respectively disposed within the cut-out recesses, one end of each plate-like terminal being connected to a pole rod which extends from one of the plates and projects into the associated cut-out recess, and the opposite end of the plate-like terminal serving as a terminal connecting portion, there is provided an<br>
%<br>
improvement characterized in that:<br>
the position where each pole rod projects in each of the paired cut-out recesses lies in a corner portion of the cut-out recess defined by two adjacent sides of the cover;<br>
the plate-like terminals connected respectively at one ends thereof to the projecting portions of the pole rods and having the opposite ends serving as terminal connecting portions are disposed respectively within the cut-out recesses along the one side substantially parallel to the arrangement direction of the electrolyte inlets; and<br>
the terminal connection portion of each plate-like terminal and the associated pole rod are offset from each other so that the terminal connecting portion is located on<br>
the other plate-like terminal side with respect to the pole rod.<br>
Accordingly, there is provided a battery having a case housing a plurality of plates and a cover for covering an upper opening of said case, said cover being in the shape of quadrilateral in plan and having a plurality of electrolyte inlets formed in a row in a juxtaposed direction of said plates, said cover having a pair of cut-out recesses formed in corner portions of both ends of one side thereof parallel to the arrangement direction of said electrolyte inlets, with plate terminals being respectively disposed within said cut-out recesses, one end of each said plate terminal being connected to a pole rod extending from one of said plates and projects into the associated said cut-out recess, and the opposite end of the plate-like terminal serving as a terminal connecting portion, the improvement characterized in that:<br>
the position where each said pole rod projects in each of said paired cut-out recesses lies in a corner portion of the cut-out recess defined by two adjacent sides of said cover;<br>
said plate-like terminals connected respectively at one ends thereof to the projecting portions of said pole rods and having the opposite ends serving as terminal connecting portions are disposed respectively within said cut-out recesses along said one side substantially parallel to the arrangement direction of said electrolyte inlets; and<br>
the terminal connecting portion of each of said plate like terminal and the associated said pole rod are offset from each other to locate terminal connecting portion on the other plate-like terminal side with respect to the pole rod.<br>
[Effects of the Invention]<br>
Since the offset between each pole rod and the terminal connecting portion of each plate-like terminal is in a direction approximately parallel to the arrangement<br>
direction of the electrolyte inlets, the restriction on the space above the plates, which is ascribable to the cut-out recesses for the said offset, is diminished, so that the<br>
cut-out recesses do not exert a so large pressure on the electrolyte when poured through the electrolyte inlets. Consequently, the poured electrolyte flows smoothly and hence the electrolyte pouring efficiency is improved. [0011]<br>
Particularly, where there is adopted a method in which electrolyte is poured into the batteries in the battery manufacturing factory before shipping, it is possible to enhance the overall production efficiency. [0012]<br>
Moreover, even if such an offset structure is adopted, it is not necessary to bend the pole rods within the case for the purpose of preventing the decrease in area of the plates.  Thus, the shape of the pole rods can be simplified and hence the production becomes so much easier.<br>
[Brief Description of the Drawings]<br>
Fig. 1 is a top view of a battery;<br>
Fig. 2 is a diagram showing in what manner a plate-like terminal is mounted; and<br>
Fig. 3 is an enlarged sectional view taken on line 3-3 in Fig. 1.<br>
[0013]<br>
[Embodiment of the Invention]<br>
Fig. 1 is a top view of a battery embodying the invention, Fig. 2 is a diagram showing in what manner a plate-like terminal is mounted, and Fig. 3 is an enlarged sectional view taken on line 3-3 in Fig. 1. [0014]<br>
In these figures, the battery is provided with a case 1 having an upper opening and a cover 2 for covering<br>
t<br>
the case 1. The caase 1 and the cover 2 are generally in a rectangular shape in plan, and a plurality of plate units 3 are arranged in parallel within the internal space formed by the case and the cover. [0015]<br>
As shown in Fig. 3, each plate unit 3 comprises an anode plate (or cathode plate) 3a, a diaphragm 3b and a cathode plate (or anode plate) 3c. The plate units 3 are arranged in such a manner that their flat plate portions are opposed to one another at predetermined intervals. [0016]<br>
Pole rods 4 of a simple, generally rod-like shape are projected rectilinearly upward from the tops of the outermost plate units 3. The interior of the case 1 is<br>
partitioned into a plurality of compartments 5 by means of partition walls 5a, and each plate unit 3 is disposed for each compartment 5 and is immersed in electrolyte 5b. [0017]<br>
As is apparent from Fig. 1, the cover 2 has a pair of long sides 6,7 and a pair of short sides 8,9, with a plurality of electrolyte inlets 10 being formed in a row along and in the vicinity of the long side 6. The electrolyte inlets 10, which are in a corresponding relation to the compartments 5, are each obturated with a plug 11 (Fig. 2). [0018]<br>
The plate units 3 are arranged side by side in a direction substantially equal to the direction perpendicular to their flat plate portions, nearly in parallel with the long sides 6,7 of the cover 2 and in parallel with the arrangement direction of the electrolyte inlets 10. [0019]<br>
In the corner portions of both longitudinal ends of the other long side 7 there are formed cut-out recesses 13 of a shape like that obtained by partially cutting out in a generally square shape the walls of the cover including connections with the short sides 8 and 9 ajacent to the<br>
long side 7. [0020]<br>
Since the cut-out recesses 13 are formed so as to extend long alon the long side 7, the amount of walls cut out toward the short sides 8 and 9 is small. Stepped portions 14 of the cover 2 are formed along the cut-out recesses 13 so as to get into the interior from both ends of the long side 7. [0021]<br>
In each cut-out recess 13, a plate-like terminal 15<br>
Â«<br>
is disposed long along the long side 7. A pole rod connecting end portion, which will be described later, as one end portion of the plate-like terminal 15 is connected with a projecting end portion of the pole rod 4 which projects from below within a connecting recess 17, the connecting recess 17 being formed in a corner portion 13a defined by the long side and the short side 8 or 9. The pole rod connecting end portion is covered with an insulating resin 18. [0022]<br>
The opposite end portion of the plate-like terminal 15 extends toward the other plate-like terminal 15 of the opposite polarity disposed in the other cut-out recess 13 which is formed in the other end portion (right-hand side<br>
in Fig. 1) of the long side 7. A connecting terminal 20<br>
provided at one end of cord 19 is attached to the said<br>
opposite end portion of the plate-like terminal with a bolt<br>
21.<br>
[0023]<br>
The cut-out recess 13 and the plate-like terminal<br>
15 both located on the other end side (righ-hand side in the figure) are also of the same construction as those<br>
located on the left-hand side in the figure.<br>
[0024]<br>
As is apparent from Fig. 2, the plate-like terminal<br>
15 has an outer, pole rod connecting end portion 30 to be fitted in the connecting recess 17 and also has a terminal connecting portion 31 which is contiguous inside to the connecting end portion 30 and which is generally in a downward U-shape.  Through holes 32 and 33 are formed in the pole rod connecting end portion 30 and the terminal connecting portion 31, respectively.  The tip of the terminal connecting portion 31 projects downward to form an inserting portion 34. [0025]<br>
*<br>
An insertion hole 24 for the inserting portion 34 is formed under the inserting portion, and in an edge portion 24a which surrounds the insertion hole 24 and an<br>
edge portion 17a which surrounds the connecting recess 17 there are formed cut-out portions 23 in positions under the terminal connecting portion 31. The cut-out portion 23 is for fitting and fixing a nut 35 therein in a swivel-stop condition. [0026]<br>
As is seen in Fig. 3, each pole rod 4 extends rectilinearly upward in a rod shape from an outermost plate unit 3 and projects into the connecting recess 17 positioned in the corner portion 13a between the long side<br>
4<br>
7 and the short side 8 or 9 at each end. [0027]<br>
The projecting end of the pole rod 4 is fitted into the through hole 32 of the pole rod connecting end portion 30 and is bonded thereto with solder 25.  Further, the insulating resin 18 is applied in a melted state from above the solder to effect insulation and waterproofing. [0028]<br>
On the other hand, as to the terminal connecting portion 31, the nut 35 is fitted beforehand into the cutout portions 23 in a swivel-stop condition, then the inserting portion 34 is inserted into the insertion hole 24 so as to cover the nut 35, then the through hole of the nut 35, through hole 33 of the terminal connecting portion 31<br>
and through hole 22 of the connecting terminal 20 are aligned together, and thereafter the bolt 21 is clamped to the nut 35. [0029]<br>
The operation of this embodiment will now be described. Since each cut-out recess 13 is disposed long along the long side 7 so that the pole rod 4 projecting into the corner portion 13a located at a corner of the plate-like terminal 15 and the terminal connecting portion 31 are offset from each other, the width W of the recess 13 toward the electrolyte inlets 10 is much smaller than the width W1 in the prior art. [0030]<br>
Consequently, the restriction made by the recess 13 on the space above the plate units 3 is diminished, resulting in that the electrolyte pouring space near the electrolyte inlets 10 is enlarged, and when electrolyte is poured from the electrolyte inlets 10, the pressure which the electrolyte 5b undergoes from the recess 13 is reduced, thus permitting the electrolyte to flow smoothly. As a result, the electrolyte pouring efficiency is improved. [0031]<br>
Especially, in the case where the electrolyte is poured into each battery in the battery manufacturing<br>
factory before shipping, it is possible to enhance the<br>
overall production efficiency.<br>
[0032]<br>
Even with such an offset structure adopted, it is not necessary to bend each pole rod 4 within the case 1 for preventing the decrease in area of the plate units 3. In other words, the pole rod 4 can be formed in a simple shape such as a generally rectilinear rod-like shape. Therefore, the production is so much facilitated. [0033]<br>
*<br>
Besides, since each plate-like terminal 15 can be spaced as far as possible from the electrolyte inlets 10 within the cover 2, even in the event of leak of the electrolyte while the electrolyte is poured into the battery, it is difficult to reach the portion around the terminal 15. [0034]<br>
Further, when the nut 35 is fitted in the cut-out portions 23, it is swivel-stopped; besides, it is pressed down by the terminal connecting portion 31 of the plate-like terminal 15, so it is not necessary that the nut 35 be embedded into the cover 2 beforehand by molding.  This point also contributes to facilitating the production. [0035]<br>
The present invention is not limited to the above embodiment, but various modifications may be-made. For example, the plate-like terminal 15 may take any of various known shapes.<br>
