				<td>Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to the game of cricket, and in particular relates to a cricket pitch.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
In the game of cricket, a.common type of delivery bowled by fast bowlers is a "bouncer", which is a fast, short pitched delivery that bounces well short-of the batsmen and rises sharply and dangerously off the pitch, often passing the batsmen at shoulder or head height.<br>
Such bouncer deliveries provide a physical injury risk to batsmen, and whilst" bouncers are at times bowled accidentally, they are often bowled intentionally to intimidate batsmen.<br>
Whilst Law 42(6) of the Laws of Cricket states that "the bowling of fast short<br>
pitched balls is dangerous and unfair	" and cricket umpires are authorised to intervene,<br>
in practice umpires often seem reluctant to take any action.<br>
Object of the Invention<br>
It is the object of the present invention to overcome or substantially ameliorate the above disadvantages.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
There is disclosed herein a cricket pitch consisting of a central portion and two opposing end portions of substantially equal length, each said end portion having a bowling crease and a popping crease and extending between the respective said bowling crease and said central portion, wherein demarcation means are provided at the junction of each said end portion and said central portion, said central portion representing a no ball zone where any bowling delivery impacting said no ball zone is deemed to be a no ball;<br>
further wherein said central portion of said pitch is at least substantially defined by a bunker extending across the width of said pitch and being filled with a material which inhibits bouncing of a cricket ball.<br>
Typically, said demarcation means comprises a line marked on and extending across the width of said pitch at each said junction.<br>
Preferably, said material is a loose granular material.<br>
Preferably, said loose granular material is sand,<br>
Preferably, each said line is offset from the respective end edge of said bunker.<br>
Preferably, each said line is offset from the respective end edge of said bunker by approximately 0.15 metres.<br>
Alternatively, said demarcation means is defined by the respective end edges of said bunker.<br>
Preferably, said bunker has a length of approximately 10 metres.<br>
Preferably, said bunker has a depth of approximately 0.3 metres.<br>
Brief Description of the Drawings<br>
A preferred form of the present invention will now be described by way of example with reference to the accompanying drawings wherein: Figure 1 is a plan view of a cricket pitch. Figure 2 is a cross-sectional side elevation view of the cricket pitch of Figure 1.<br>
Detailed Description of the Preferred Embodiments<br>
Referring to the accompanying drawings, a cricket pitch 1 is marked with a bowling crease 2, popping crease 3 and return creases 4 at each opposing end of the pitch 1 according to the usual laws of cricket. A wicket 5, consisting of three stumps and two bails, is driven into Ihe bowling crease 2 at each end of the pitch 1, again according to the usual laws of cricket.<br>
The pitch is divided into two opposing end portions 6, including the bowling crease 2 and popping crease 3, and a central portion 7. As can best be seen from Figure 1, each end portion 6 extends between the bowling crease 2 and the central portion 7. Demarcation means, here in the form of a white line 8 marked on and extending across the width of the pitch 1, are provided at the junction between each end portion 6 and the central portion 7.<br>
The central portion 7 is substantially defined by a bunker 9 which extends across' the width of the pitch 1 and is filled with loose granular material, here in the form of dry sand 10 or any other material which inhibits bouncing of the ball, for example foam rubber cushion. The bunker here has a depth of approximately 0.30 metres (12 inches) and is filled to the same level as the surface of the end portions 6 of the pitch I.<br>
In order to prevent glare the top layer of sand 10 in the bunker 9 (approximately 2 inches deep) could be mixed with fine dry grass clippings or chaff or similar material<br>
In the pitch 1 depicted, the lines 8, referred to as the bunker creases, are offset from the end edges 9a of the bunker 9 by approximately 0.15 metres (6 inches). Alternatively, in a less preferred embodiment, the demarcation means defining the junction between the end portion 6 and the central portion 7 could be defined by the end edges 9a of the bunker 9, thereby omitting the bunker crease lines 8.<br>
The bunker crease lines 8 are marked on the pitch in white in the same manner as the bowling, popping and return creases 2, 3,4, and typically have a length of 3.05 metres (10 feet), being the standard width of the pitch.<br>
The bunker 9 will typically have a length of approximately 10 metres, and here has a length of 10.06 metres (11 yards), being half the entire length of the standard 20.12 metre (22 yard) pitch as measured between the bowling creases 2.<br>
The central portion 7 between the bunker creases 8 represents a no ball zone where, when playing the game of cricket under modified rules adapted to the pitch 1, a bowling delivery impacting the no ball zone between the bunker creases 8 is deemed to be a no ball. In such modified laws of cricket, the back edge of the bunker crease 8 would be the precise line by which a no ball is judged, consistent with the bowling and popping creases 2,3.<br>
Under the modified laws of cricket, a delivery impacting the bunker 9 would be declared a dead ball in addition to being called a no ball for impacting the no ball zone between the bunker creases 8.<br>
With provision of the no ball zone defined by the central portion 7 of the pitch between the bunker creases 8, a bowler will be penalised for bowling any short pitched deliveries with the calling of a no ball, providing an incentive to bowl fuller pitched deliveries, and thereby reducing the risk of injury to the batsman. Further, provision of the sand filled bunker 9 will prevent any ball which has been pitched sufficiently short to impact the bunker 9 from bouncing off the pitch and rising sharply towards the batsman's upper body. A ball impacting the bunker 9 in this manner will leave a divot in the sand, and accordingly a rake may be provided for smoothing the bunker surface in a similar manner to that of a golf bunker.<br>
The optimum length of the bunker 9 is a debatable matter. Whilst a bunker length of approximately 10 metres will provide a significant degree of protection to the batsman, the ultimate length of the bunker approved according to modified laws of the game of cricket would be determined by the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) in<br>
conjunction with the International Cricket Council (ICC) and the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) who currently determine the official laws of the game.<br>
It is envisaged that the bunker 9 might be dispensed with in some applications, resulting in the only modification from a standard pitch being the inclusion of the bunker creases 8. With such a pitch configuration, protection for the batsmen would be provided solely by the disincentive to the bowler resulting from any short pitched ball falling short of the opposing bunker crease 8 and impacting the pitch central portion 7 being deemed a no ball.<br>
In another configuration, the bunker crease 8 could be dispensed with, with the junction between the end and central portions 6,7 of the pitch 1 being defined by the end edges 9a of the bunker 9 as described above. In this configuration, any ball falling within the central portion (and thereby impacting the bunker 9) will be deemed both a no ball and a dead ball.<br>
As well as providing protection to batsmen, a cricket pitch configured with a bunker 9 as described would be likely to contribute to cricket being played within the Spirit of the Game as stated in The Preamble to The Laws of Cricket (of the 2000 Code). Such a cricket pitch would also likely have a lower building and maintenance cost than existing standard pitches with a turf, malting, concrete or other construction.<br><br><br><br><br>
