3. PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br>
Technical field of Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a non-synthetic hormonal or natural NSAID poly herbal composition. The present invention particularly relates to a poly herbal synergistic composition of saraca indica and other herbs along with 'anupana' and process of preparation thereof. More particularly the present invention relates to a poly herbal composition wherein the herbal extracts are prepared by selective solvent extraction of the crude herbs. The poly herbal composition of the present invention is effective in the treatment of irregular menstrual cycle resulting from the synergy of the composition.<br>
Background and prior art<br>
Irregular menstrual cycle is a disorder that affects the female reproductive system due to various reasons like an alteration or an imbalance in hormonal levels of estrogen and progesterone during the menstrual cycle. Pre-menstrual syndrome is also due to a hormonal imbalance, caused by excessive levels of estrogen and inadequate progesterone levels which leads to fluid retention. Fluid retention affects the blood flow and reduces oxygen in the uterus and the brain.<br>
At present in modern medicine different treatment options are available, depending on the severity of the symptoms. Mild analgesics in mild cases and in severe cases, restriction of salt intake and the use of diuretic to control fluid retention may be indicated. In some cases hormonal replacement is also advised.<br>
Menstruation is considered normal, if it occurs regularly every month for a period of five days, this fluid is not having mucous, neither too much nor too less in quantity and accompanied without burning sensation and pain. Reference, Sushruth Samhita, Sutrasthan.chap-2<br>
Common causes of irregular menstrual cycle are, the alteration in estrogen and progesterone during the menstrual cycle (hormonal imbalance); uterine lesions e.g. fibroids, polyps, cancer; damage caused from an intra-uterine contraceptive device (IUD); pelvic inflammatory disease like bacterial infection of the uterus, fallopian tubes and<br>
1<br><br>
other areas of pelvic; adenomiosis, the growth of the endometrium in to the underlining muscular layer of the uterus; ectopic pregnancy; hydatid mole, an abnormal mass in the uterus caused by poorly developed or degenerating fertilized egg; uterine leiomyoma, benign, fibrous tumor that occurs in 40% of women by age 40; endometriosis, inflammation of the endometrium caused by bacterial infection; trauma; sexual abuse; medications; foreign bodies viz. tampoons and condoms<br>
Ayurveda attributes the causes of irregular menstrual cycle as indulging excess of incompatible foods, over eating, alcoholic, beverages and uncooked foods, frequent abortions, excessive sexual intercourse, riding on animals, walking long distances, emaciation due to any cause, trauma, sleeping at day time and other causes afflicted with 'pradara' (excessive discharge of menstrual fluid)<br>
'Pradara' is of four kinds, produced by kapha, pitta and vata separately and also by all of them together. General symptoms of this disease are aches all over the body and pain in abdomen during the menstrual period. If there is too much of menstrual discharge it produces debility, giddiness, fainting, toxic state, thirst, burning sensation, delerium, paler of the skin, stupor, and some of the diseases of vata origin. The menstrual discharge will be Ama (ill processed) if it smells, is heavy, mixed with mucous, yellowish white in color and resembles rice washed water. It is produced by pitta, if the discharge is yellow, blue, black and red in color, warm and comes out in gushes. It is produced by vata, if the discharge is viscid, crimson in color, froathy, scandy, resembling mutton washed water and accompanied with vataj type of pain. If the disease is caused by all the three dosas together the flow will be like a honey, ghee, orpiment or bone marrow in color and emitting cadaveric smell.<br>
Etiopathogenesis of Amenorrhea: According to Ayurveda, aggravated vata and pitta affect blood by drying-up menstrual blood (raja), which ceases the regular flow of menses (nashtartava or ksheenartava). General symptoms that are associated with this condition are emaciation and pallor. It suggests the deficiency of blood or a severely anaemic condition and weakness.<br>
2<br><br>
Conventional medicine indicates that amenorrhea is due to a wide range of causes that include anatomic or structural and physiological or functional defects. It can be congenital or develop at a certain age because of a particular change. There can be a defect from the ovarian or uterine level to hypothalamus and pituitary level.<br>
Structurally or anatomically there are four major congenital anomalies viz., absence of uterus or some part of the vagina, failure of the vagina to develop or underdeveloped vagina, imperforate hymen, or intrauterine synechiae. All these consequently result in primary amenorrhea.<br>
In Ayurveda several herbal ingredients have been reported for the treatment of irregular menstrual cycle, one of them is the popular so called women's drug Saraca indica. Saraca indica is locally known as 'Ashoka' and is found through out India. The whole herb is useful for the treatment of menorrhagia, dysmenorrhea, uterine fibroids, leucorrhoea and is considered as a uterine sedative and tonic.<br>
Oral administration of the whole plant in the form of powder significantly reduces signs and symptoms of irregular menstrual cycle and other dysfunctional uterine bleeding (DUB). Reference, BHMA .1983. British herbal pharmacopoeia, Bournemouth and Bradley PR, 1992. British herbal compodium.<br>
US Patent 6642212 describes a novel health supplement containing phytoestrogens, analogues or metabolites there of. This particular patent discloses a method for the management of premenstrual syndrome and/or postmenopausal symptoms.<br>
Another US Patent 6589569 describes method and composition for treatment of premenstrual syndrome in women. In this patent a medicinal composition consisting of Asparagus racemosus and other herbs useful in the treatment of PMS are disclosed. The active component of Asparagus racemosus is saponin glucoside (A 4).<br>
Currently antispasmodic, anti-inflammatory and other hormonal drugs are available in allopathic treatment but in long term antispasmodics, anti-inflammatory drugs have harmful side effects.<br>
3<br><br>
The present invention describes a novel poly herbal synergistic composition using the extract of Saraca indica and other herbs along with 'anupana' and process of preparation thereof. The poly herbal composition is effective for the treatment of irregular menstrual cycle.<br>
According to Ayurveda ‘anupana’ (catalyst) is one of the key components to improve the drug efficacy .e.g.: Honey, ghee, taila, jeera etc.<br>
Object of the invention<br>
The object of the present invention is to provide non-synthetic hormonal or natural NSAID poly herbal composition.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide novel poly herbal synergistic composition comprising the extracts of Saraca indica and other herbs along with ‘anupana’<br>

Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a non-synthetic hormonal or natural NSAID poly herbal composition. The present invention relates to poly herbal synergistic composition for the treatment of irregular menstrual cycle and the process of preparation thereof. The herbal extracts are prepared by selective solvent extraction of the crude herbs. To improve the efficacy of the extracts, the extraction is prepared by selective solvent extraction method, which enhances and enriches the extracts with reference to the herbal actives to make the formulation for the treatment of irregular menstrual cycle.<br>
The present invention relates to herbal composition comprising the extracts of Saraca indica, Asperagus racemosus, Dashmool, Symplocos racemosa, Emblica officinalis,Terminalia belerica, Nelubium speciosum, Cedrus deodara, Mesua ferrea, Nardostachys jatamansi, Bombax malabaricum, Zingiber officinale, Terminalia chebula, Cuminum cyminum {'anupana').<br>
6<br><br>
The present invention describes a novel poly herbal composition using the extract of Saraca indica and other herbs mentioned above along with ‘anupana’  for the treatment of irregular menstrual cycle.<br>
'Anupana' (catalyst) is one of the key components to improve the drug efficacy .e.g.: Honey, ghee, taila, jeeraka etc. In the present composition jeeraka is the anupana.<br>
Our scientists have conducted comparative clinical trials of composition comprising anupana and composition without anupana, with the view to establish the synergy. Clinical trials studies show composition comprising anupana is more effective than those without anupana and also the time for the treatment for irregular menstrual cycle is reduced to 20% when compared to the composition without anupana. The synergy in the composition has been proved as above.<br>
