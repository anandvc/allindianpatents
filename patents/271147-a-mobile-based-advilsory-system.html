The server (S) end of the system is provided with a data tagging, arranging and processing means (DPM) for linking data with the user's query.<br>
Referring to the drawings there is shown in Figure 2 the work flow of the mobile terminal based advisory system. The operation of the invention can be described as follows:<br>
Region specific application required for the system to operate is<br>
downloaded by a farmer on his mobile terminal (1).<br>
The farmer launches the downloaded application by pressing a key<br>
(2).<br>
The application acquires the location of the mobile terminal using a<br>
GPS modem (3).<br>
Menu in the local language of the farmer is displayed on the mobile<br>
terminal (4).<br>
Along with this, the application in the mobile terminal plays the voice<br>
menu in the local language of the farmer (5).<br>
12<br><br>
The farmer responds to this menu by pressing appropriate keys or ICONS or by giving certain voice commands (6). The weather parameters are obtained using sensors installed in the field (7).<br>
Sensors placed in the field detect soil parameters like moisture content, salinity, Ph, fertility level and the like and send these to the mobile terminal or to a remote server (8).<br>
The data from the sensors is periodically transmitted to a data logger. The data logger acquires the location of the system using a GPS modem (9).<br>
The farmer can also capture some images and attach it to his query (10).<br>
The pre processing unit arranges the image, sensor data, weather parameters, location parameters and the like in a specific format (11). A personalization means stamp the data with identification parameters like farmer id, farm id and mobile number (12).<br>
This data is transmitted as a query to a remote server via a wireless network or Internet (13).<br>
The server receives the query along with the transmitted data and retrieves the relevant data from its database or Internet. This information is sent to a human expert group or an expert workstation for analysis (14).<br>
The expert launches a browser and connects to the server. The human expert or an expert workstation read the queries sent to it and analyzes the query using the weather and soil parameters and images sent by the server (15).<br>
13<br><br>
The expert group or the expert workstation then formulates an advice (16).<br>
This advice is then sent to the server or mobile terminal of the fanner directly via a wireless network or Internet (17). The advice is sent to the mobile terminal in the local language of the farmer. The mobile terminal displays this advice or converts it to a voice format in the local language of the farmer (18).<br>
The mobile terminal advisory system sends alerts to the farmer on his mobile terminal in case of sudden weather changes. Also, the farmer will be provided with forecast of the weather conditions for upcoming week.<br>
The farmer may request in his query for the current rates of transport means via different routes and the prices of the agricultural produce at the market places near the location of the farmer. Also, the farmer can request for information as to which factories have a demand for his agricultural produce. The server (S) acquires this data from the Internet and sends it to the mobile terminal of the farmer. This helps the farmer to decide the best place to sell his produce to gain maximum benefit.<br>
The farmer receives advertisements from different companies on his mobile terminal related to agricultural goods like seed suppliers, fertilizer producers, tractor manufacturers, transporters and the like whose services are required by the farmers. Thus the advertisers pay the bulk of cost of required for this purpose while the farmers are required to pay only a nominal registration charges.<br>
14<br><br>
This system may be used to obtain information and advice regarding weather conditions for various activities like agriculture, adventure sports like trekking, skiing, biking and fishing or for obtaining information about the traffic conditions on the roads and market rates of different commodities. While all these applications of this invention are possible, the system of this invention is particularly used for providing advice and information regarding agricultural activities.<br>
Advantages:<br>
This system provides soil, weather, crop related and other such information<br>
through the use of sensors such as soil, weather, and leaf and camera phone<br>
in response to a farmer's query.<br>
The time, location and crop specific information and in addition to farmer's<br>
profile, help human experts or machine application running on a remote<br>
computer system to answer farmer's query effectively.<br>
This method is similar to a physical visit of an expert to the farm that would<br>
conduct test on the soil, visually inspect the crop and get to know the local<br>
weather and come up with a specific answer to a farmer's query.<br>
Additional advantage of this invention over physical visit is the availability<br>
of various tools such as best farming practices, pest model, and pictorial<br>
dictionary of plant diseases to the expert.<br>
Since the system is electronic, it can scale up easily and reach hundreds of<br>
millions of farmers which conventional system will not be able to do.<br>
While considerable emphasis has been placed herein on the components and component parts of the preferred embodiments, it will be appreciated that<br>
15<br><br>
many embodiments can be made and that many changes can be made in the preferred embodiments without departing from the principles of the invention. These and other changes in the preferred embodiment as well as other embodiments of the invention will be apparent to those skilled in the art from the disclosure herein, whereby it is to be distinctly understood that the foregoing descriptive matter is to be interpreted merely as illustrative of the invention and not as a limitation.<br>
