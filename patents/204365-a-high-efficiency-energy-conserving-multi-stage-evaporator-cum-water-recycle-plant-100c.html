GRANTED<br><br>
This invention relates to a high efficiency energy conserving multi stage evaporator cum water recycling plant using instant steaming (IBR/NONTBR) steam boiler. More particularly high efficiency energy conserving multistage evaporator cum water recycle plant for effluents/waste water.<br>
In known multistage evaporator cum water recycle plant having following features :-<br>
1)	vacuum is applied in last stage condenser and total system is under vacuum.<br>
2)	Only partial degassing is done. This results in tremendous foaming and process destabilization.<br>
3)	IBR steam boiler used. Therefore a certified boiler attendants is required. The annual boiler inspection is to be carried out. During annual inspection boiler is kept out of operation unless a stand by boiler is made available.<br>
4)	Efficiency of evaporation is low.<br>
With these features of known multistage evaporator plant following drawbacks exist.<br>
1)	As evaporation system is operated under vacuum it requires perfect sealing arrangements.<br>
2)	Due to partial degassing of feed water, the dissolved gases present inside feed water could not be removed. This results in tremendous foaming and process destabilization.<br>
3)	Use of IBR boiler required certified boiler attendant and annual inspection. During boiler inspection stoppage of plant.<br>
4)	Due to low evaporation efficiency running cost of plant.<br>
It is object of the present invention to provide a high efficiency energy conserving evaporator cum water recycle plant working under pressure, having on line degassing system, and operatable on NON-IBR instant steaming boiler.<br><br>

outlet with inlet for feed water and an outlet for condensate; ii)       the said outlet of steam of earlier stage connected to steam inlet of next stage; iii)      the said inlet of feed water provided with three way divertor valve, and said outlet<br>
of condensate connected to individual condensate heat exchanger; iv)      a feed water tank provided to receive preheated feed water from the boiler<br>
economizer, heat exchanger heated by waste steam and condenser heat exchanger<br>
of last stage of falling film evaporator; v)        the said feed tank provided with heating means by steam to raise the temperature<br>
of feed water to 100°c and adequate gas release area provided to release dissolved<br>
gases; vi)       pipe means to supply said heated feed water to first stage falling film evaporator<br>
provided passing through last stage said individual condensate heat exchanger to<br>
first stage individual condensate heat exchanger; vii)      said all individual condensate heat exchanger outlet made common to-collect<br>
distilled water and store the same.<br>
Invention is described with reference to accompanying drawing wherein Figure 1 shows plant layout of high efficiency energy conserving multistage evaporator cum water recycling plant according to invention.<br>
Now referring to the figure of accompanying , the evaporator comprises number of falling film evaporators. In the figure seven set of falling film evaporators fl, f2, O, f4, f5, f6, f7 are provided. The each of the falling film evaporator is provided with three way valve 12 to supply feed water there in. The water level in the said falling film evaporator is maintained with the help said three-way divertor valve 12. For maintaining water level inside the said evaporator level indicator cum transmitter 15 is provided. A steam inlet and an outlet are provide to each of the falling film evaporator. The feed water flows from inside of the tube in form of a thin film.<br><br>
The steam as a heating media is supplied on the out side of the said tube under pressure. The steam generated in falling film evaporator is provided with moisture separator 13 for removing the water from the wet steam and thus dried said steam is supplied to next falling film evaporator. There is also provide outlet for condensate in each of falling film evaporator. The each of the said condensate outlet is connected to an individual condensate heat exchanger through which feed water is passed for raising the temperature by Utilising heat of condensate. In the figure said condensate heat exchanger are indicated by numerals 5 to 10. The outlets of said all condensate heat exchangers are made common to collect distilled water and send to storage. The feed water from feed tank is supplied condensate heat exchanger 5 by means of circulation pump. And next same is passed through condensate heat exchanger 6. Similarly it taken last condensate heat exchanger 10. The out let of condensate heat exchanger 10 is connected to first falling film tube evaporator f-.lthrough two way valve. The steam supply to the first falling film evaporator is supplied from boiler. The outlet steam from the steam outlet of the first falling film evaporator f-1 is supplied to next falling film evaporator f-2. Similar arrangement is made for third f-3, forth f-4, fifth f-5, sixth f-6 and seventh f-7. After third stage of falling film evaporator the part steam coming out of outlet is fed to thermo-compressor as a secondary steam and motive steam at required high press to get steam at required pressure which is fed to first stage. The separated water from moist steam is also taken out with help circulation pump 14 and supplied to next stage falling film evaporator through three way divertor valve. Thus feed is concentrated partially. The boiler economizer is used to heat feed water. In the figure 1 there is shown two economizers of boiler 1 &amp; 2 provided to heat feed water through pipe line p-1. Also the feed water is heated through condenser 3 which is heated by waste heat of last stage waste steam and condensate heat exchanger 4 which is heated by the condensate of last stage of falling film evaporator. The heated feed water is taken to feed tank 11. The said feed water tank is provided with steam heating to raise the temperature of feed water to 100° c to remove dissolved gases. The said feed water 11 tank is also provided with adequate gas release area and continuous modulation of temperature and level control system.<br><br><br>

2)	Feed is further heated up to 100°c in feed tank 11 to remove dissolved gases completely. Feed tank is provided with adequate gas release area and continuous modulation temperature and level control.<br>
3)	Waste water /feed is feed to first stage falling film evaporator with help of feed pump. The feed flows from inside of the tubes in very thin film. The steam as a heating media is supplied on tube from out side at required pressure. The heated feed gets collected at the bottom of the evaporator where steam gets separated. The steam then supplied to next stage through high efficiency moisture separator. The condensate from the shell side pass through condensate heat exchanger to pre heat the feed and collected in distilled water tank. The level indicator cum controllers are installed on each stages to maintain constant level inside evaporator with help of three way divertor valve. Partially concentrated feed is transferred to next the stage where the<br><br><br>
above process is repeated. Part of steam coming out of 3rd stage is fed to thermo-compressor as a secondary steam and motive steam at required high press to get at required pressure which is feed to the lst stage evaporator. Steam generated in last stage is passed through condenser to preheat the incoming feed and concentrated feed is drain out or can be treated with available presmud.<br>
