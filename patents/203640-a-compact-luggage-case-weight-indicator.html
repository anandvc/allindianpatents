1-6-2004  /  22-3-2002<br><br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a compact luggage case weight indicator.<br>
The term luggage case wherever used in the specification includes suitcase with or without a reinforcing metallic frame around the sidewall of the bottom shell thereof. The reference to sidewall of the bottom shell of a luggage case includes the reinforcing metallic frame around the sidewall.<br>
PRIOR ART<br>
Weighing of a packed luggage case, if required, is to be done on a weighing machine or platform which is bulky, heavy and expensive and it is not normally easily possible to have it individually. Weight of a luggage case is critical especially while travelling by air because of the weight restrictions in passenger aircrafts. Excess luggage may attract penalty by way of extra charge or it may have to be unpacked from the luggage case causing<br>
2<br><br>
a lot of in convenience and embarrassment to the traveller with the luggage case especially at check in counters and when he is in a hurry.<br>
OBJECTS OF INVENTION<br>
An objective of the invention is to provide a compact luggage case weight indicator which is of negligible weight and indicates the weight of the packed luggage case instantly on being lifted without having to be weighed on a weighing machine or platform.<br>
Another objective of die invention is to provide a compact luggage case weight indicator which is economical<br>
Another objective of the invention is to provide a compact luggage case weight indicator which is simple in construction and easy to operate.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION<br>
According to the invention there is provided a compact luggage, case weight indicator comprising a pair of spaced closed ends open bottom<br><br>
oblong lags rigidly fitted to the sidewall of the bottom shell of the luggage case against the open back sides thereof, each of the lugs being provided with a partial oblong slot along the front side wall thereof, a pair of linear slides relatively oppositely slidably disposed for guided movement between the lugs within a transparent cover rigidly fitted to the inner ends of the lugs, one of the linear slides being calibrated linearly in weight units and the other linear slide being provided with a calibration indicator, the guide sliders being stressed by a pair of calibrated tension springs located in the lugs and a pair of button sliders each being disposed on the front side wall of each lug and coupled to the respective linear slide through the oblong slot along the front sidewall of each lug, the length of the oblong slots corresponding to the travel of the linear slides and a handle whose ends are connected to the tension springs.<br>
The following is a detailed description of the invention with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which :<br>

Fig 5 is exploded view of the weight indicator of Fig 1;<br>
Fig 6 is open bottom side isometric view of a lug of the weight indicator of Fig 1; and<br>
5<br><br><br>
Fig 7 is isometric view of the guide slide of the weight indicator of Figl -<br>
As illustrated in Figs 1 to 7 of the accompanying drawings, 1 is a compact luggage case weight indicator comprising a pair of spaced closed ends open bottom oblong lugs 2, 2 rigidly fitted to the sidewall 3 of the bottom shell (not shown) of a luggage case such as suitcase (not shown) against the open back sides thereof with screws 4 (Figs 1, 2,4 and 5). Where the luggage case is provided with a reinforcing metallic frame around the sidewall of the bottom shell of the luggage case, reference numeral 3 represents such metallic frame. 5 is base plate of the side wall.  Each of the<br><br>
lugs is provided with a partial oblong slot 6 along the front sidewall thereof.   4a represents holes in the lugs 2 for screws 4 (Fig 6). 7 and 8 are pair of linear slides relatively oppositely slidably disposed one over the other between the lugs within a transparent cover 9 which is rigidly fitted to projections 10 at the inner ends of the lugs using screws 11 (Figs 1, 2, and 3). Ha represents holes in projections 10 for screws 11 (Fig 6). The slides are provided with stems 12 and 13 protruding into the lugs and having bosses 14<br>
6<br><br>
and 15 at the outer ends thereof, respectively. The inner shde is calibrated linearly (calibrations marked 16) in weight units such as kilograms. The outer shde is provided with a window 17 and a calibration indicator 18 at the centre of the window. The slides are stressed by a pair of calibrated tension springs 19 and 20 located in the lugs. One end of the tension spring 19 is anchored to the outer end of the respective lug and its other end is pressing against a guide slider 21 abutting boss 14 of slider 7. One end of the other tension spring 20 is anchored to the outer end of the respective lug and its other end is pressing against a guide slider 22 abutting boss 15 of slider 8. 23,23 are a pair of button sliders each disposed on the front sidewall of each lug." The button sliders are coupled to the respective bosses of the stems of the sliders with knurled pins 24 passing through the oblong slots 6 along the front sidewalls of the lugs. The pins 24 are engaged in corresponding grooves 23a and 14a and 15a in the button sliders 23 and the respective bosses 14 and 15 respectively. The length of the oblong slots corresponds to the travel of the linear slides. 25 is a flexible handle of moulded plastics such as polyvinyl chloride. The handle ends are connected to the tension<br>
7<br><br>
springs with steel wire 26 through the guide sliders. The other end of tension spring 19 is anchored to one steel wire 26 through guide slide 21 and the other end of tension spring 20 is anchored to the other steel wire 26 through guide slide 22 (Fig 5). The inner ends outer corners of the lugs are curved marked 27 and the handle ends are correspondingly curved marked 28 to seat the handle ends flush with the curved inner ends outer corners of the lugs<br>
(Fig l).<br>
The luggage case weight indicator of the invention is as shown in Fig 1 of the drawings in its non-operative position. On lifting the packed luggage case by holding the handle 25 the entire weight of the luggage case is transferred to the tension springs through the handle and the tension springs expand linearly in opposite directions corresponding to the weight of the luggage case. Due to the expansion of the springs the linear slides are stressed and moved forward linearly relatively in opposite directions thereby converting the expansion of the calibrated tension springs corresponding to the weight of the luggage case into linear displacement of the linear slides.<br>
8<br><br>
The resultant arithmetic sum of the linear displacements corresponding to the weight of the packed luggage case as indicated by the calibration indicator 18 on the outer linear slide against the corresponding calibration 16 on the inner linear slide through the window 17 in the outer linear slide, gives the weight of the luggage case. When the tension springs expand the button slides also move forward with the linear slides in the same direction. The guide slides 21 and 22 in abutment with the bosses 14 and 15 of the linear slides also move forward with the tension springs (Fig 2). On resting the luggage case on the floor or similar surface and releasing the handle grip, the handle moves to its original position under contraction of the springs. The guide slides 21 and 22 retract with the tension springs but the linear slides and button slides will remain in position (Fig 3). Therefore, the weight may be taken conveniently after resting the luggage case on the floor or similar surface. On taking the weight reading, the button slides and linear slides are retracted to the original position manually (Fig 1). The weight indicator is now ready for taking weight again. The length of the oblong slots 6 corresponds to the travel of the linear slides in the forward and backward<br>
9<br><br>
directions. The guide slides 21 and 22 ensure guided sliding movement of the linear slides by being in contact with the outer ends of the springs and the bosses at the outer ends of the linear slides. A flexible handle facilitates to grip the handle comfortably. Due to the handle ends of the luggage case being flush with the inner ends outer corners of the lugs, the luggage case has a good aesthetic look.<br>
Using the weight indicator of the invention, weight of a packed luggage is taken instantly simply by lifting the luggage case in the comforts of one"s house or in a hotel room prior to travelling. It thus eliminates the need of weighing machines or platform and the chances of carrying excess baggage and ensuing problems. It is very compact and of negligible weight. It is very much economical as compared to weighing machines or platforms. It is simple in construction and easy to operate.<br>
The lugs, guide slides, button slides and linear slides may be of different geometries/constructions. The linear slides may be disposed side by<br>
10<br><br>
side with one having the calibrations and the other having the calibration indicator. The handle may be rigid. Besides spring steel strips, similarly strong ropes, wires or straps may be used to interconnect the handles and tension springs The inner ends outer corners of the lugs and handle ends may not be curved. The protective transparent cover is optional. Such variations are to be construed and understood to be within the scope of the invention.<br>
