				<td>Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to Code Division Multiple Access 1X Evolution Data Only<br>
(CDMA 1X EV-DO) technology in a mobile communication system, and particularly to a<br>
method for providing a requested forward private line rate for a private line user based on<br>
CDMA 1X EV-DO network system.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
In a mobile communication system, for users wishing to get data processing services with<br>
higher rate or larger capacity, the data transmission rate of CDMA 1X EV-DO, an<br>
optimized version of CDMA 2000, is comparable to that of Digital Subscriber Line (DSL)<br>
because the highest transmission rate supported by CDMA 1X EV-DO can exceed 2Mbps<br>
and the throughput of CDMA 1X EV-DO can exceed 700kbps; and CDMA 1X EV-DO<br>
also supports services with stricter demand on data transmission rate, such as video<br>
transmission, large-scale file download etc.. CDMA 1X EV-DO is also able to transmit<br>
data with lowest cost-per-Mbytes, which is an important factor for greatly popularizing<br>
Wireless Internet.<br>
In a CDMA 1X EV-DO network system according to the prior art, after a call connection is<br>
established between the system and user terminals, the system determines a forward data<br>
transmission rate according to the maximum signal intensity among the signal intensities<br>
reported by the user terminals, and in order to maximize the throughput of the forward<br>
transmission bandwidth, a user with larger signal intensity often gets a higher transmission<br>
rate (i.e. occupies a wider forward transmission bandwidth) and a user with smaller signal<br>
intensity often gets a lower transmission rate (i.e. occupies a narrower forward<br>
transmission bandwidth).<br>
During reverse data transmission from the user terminals to the system, each user terminal<br>
will increase or reduce its reverse data transmission rate according to a Reverse Activity<br>
Bit (RAB) indication and a transition probability table forwardly transmitted by the system.<br>
Referring to accompanying FIG1, there is shown a schematic diagram illustrating a<br>
l<br><br>
Bit (RAB) indication and a transition probability table forwardly transmitted by the system.<br>
Referring to accompanying FIG1, there is shown a schematic diagram illustrating a<br>
process that a user terminal increases or reduces its transmission rate in the CDMA 1X<br>
EV-DO network system according to the prior art. The process is as follows.<br>
The user terminal automatically adjusts the reverse transmission rate based on the RAB<br>
indication forwardly broadcasted by an Activity Sector.<br>
In general, the system forwardly transmits indication information that the RAB is set to 1<br>
when the load borne by the system is heavier; the system forwardly transmits indication<br>
information that the RAB is set to 0 when the load borne by the system is lighter.<br>
The user terminal reduces the transmission rate with a probability q when the RAB is equal<br>
to 1 (the probability q may be set by the base station, or may be a default value used by the<br>
user terminal; as shown in accompanying FIG1, the user terminal may reduce the<br>
transmission rate from 153.6Kbps to 153.6Kbpsxq4=76.8Kbps); if the reverse<br>
transmission rate of the user terminal is lower than 9.6Kbps, it will not be reduced any<br>
more.<br>
The user terminal increases the transmission rate with a probability p when the RAB is<br>
equal to 0 (the probability p may be set by the base station, or may be a default value used<br>
by the user terminal; as shown in accompanying FIG1, the user terminal may increase the<br>
transmission rate from 9.6Kbps to 9.6Kbpsxpl=19.2Kbps); if the reverse transmission rate<br>
of the user terminal is higher than the maximal limit rate 153.6Kbps, it will not be<br>
increased any more; and if the reverse transmission power is not enough, the reverse<br>
transmission rate will not be increased any more.<br>
In summary, in the CDMA 1X EV-DO network system according to the prior art, after the<br>
call connection is established between the system and user terminals, the system<br>
determines the forward data transmission rate according to the maximum signal intensity<br>
among the signal intensities reported by the user terminals, and in order to maximize the<br>
throughput of the forward transmission bandwidth, according to Reverse Activity (RA )<br>
indication reversely transmitted by the user terminals, the system balances the load borne<br><br><br>
by the system and the data transmission rates of the user terminals. However, this method<br>
may lead to a very low data transmission rate and even an outage for a user terminal whose<br>
channel condition is not very good (i.e. the signal intensity of the user terminal is lower<br>
than those of the other user terminals); thus an assurable data transmission rate cannot be<br>
provided for a single user and the user's demand on some services cannot be satisfied; for<br>
example, some users requesting bank services intend to use assurable private line rates for<br>
performing data switching and accomplishing operations such as an ATM collection.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
The disclosed embodiments provide a method for providing a requested forward private<br>
line rate for a private line user based on CDMA 1X EV-DO network system so that the<br>
CDMA 1X EV-DO network system can provide assurable private line rates for the user and<br>
meet the need of corresponding data services.<br>
According to an embodiment of the invention, a method for providing a requested forward<br>
private line rate for a private line user of a Code Division Multiple Access 1X Evolution<br>
Data Only (CDMA 1X EV-DO) system, wherein, includes the following processes:<br>
setting a forward private line rate requested by the private line user;<br>
obtaining a Data Rate Control (DRC) value of a location of the private line user through a<br>
test procedure;<br>
obtaining a ratio of forward transmission timeslots to total forward transmission timeslots<br>
by dividing the forward private line rate by the DRC value of the location of the private line,<br>
wherein the ratio meets the need of the forward private line rate of the private line user;<br>
providing, by the system, the requested forward private line rate for the private line user by<br>
using corresponding timeslots of the total forward transmission timeslots according to the<br>
ratio.<br>
The method still has the following features.<br>
A process is also included between the process of obtaining the ratio of forward<br>
transmission timeslots to total forward transmission timeslots and the process of providing:<br><br><br>
judging, by the system, whether the system can provide the requested forward private line<br>
rate for the private line user according to the ratio; if so, performing process of providing;<br>
otherwise, the method ending.<br>
The system provides the requested forward private line rate for the private line user by<br>
limiting the number of non-private line users accessing the sytem.<br>
According to the ratio, the system calculates the number of the non-private line users<br>
accessing the sytem to be limited to meet the need of the forward private line rates of all<br>
private line users.<br>
The method further includes a process of multiplying, by a base station on the system side,<br>
the DRC value of location of the private line user by a weight to ensure that the private line<br>
user is preferentially scheduled.<br>
The method further includes a process of limiting, by the system, a forward transmission<br>
rate of the private line user to ensure that the forward transmission rate of the private line<br>
user does not exceed the requested forward private line rate.<br>
The method further includes a process of setting a reverse private line rate requested by the<br>
private line user.<br>
The method further includes a process of increasing a reverse transmission rate to the<br>
reverse private line rate and holding the reverse transmission rate at the reverse private line<br>
rate when the reverse transmission rate reaches the reverse private line rate, by the private<br>
line user, according to a reverse transition probability table arranged by the system.<br>
The above method still has the following features.<br>
The process of holding, by the private line user, the reverse transmission rate at the reverse<br>
private line rate is achieved by setting, by the system, an increase probability to zero after<br>
the reverse transmission rate reaches the reverse private line rate in the reverse transition<br>
probability table;<br>
or by transmitting, by the system, a rate-limit signaling to the private line user when the<br>
reverse transmission rate reaches the reverse private line rate.<br><br><br>
In the method, the private line user may be a fixed user or a mobile user in the CDMA 1X<br>
EV-DO mobile communication system.<br>
In the method for providing a requested forward private line rate for a private line user<br>
according to the embodiments of the present invention, according to the requested forward<br>
private line rate set for the user and the electrically tested Data Rate Control (DRC) value<br>
of the location of the user, a ratio of forward transmission timeslots to total forward<br>
transmission timeslots for meeting the need of the forward private line rate of the user is<br>
calculated; then according to the ratio, the system provides the requested forward private<br>
line rate for the private line user by using the corresponding timeslots out of the total<br>
forward transmission timeslots. Thereby, the purpose that the user enjoys the private line<br>
rate in the CDMA 1X EV-DO network system is achieved, and the user's demand on the<br>
corresponding data service is satisfied.<br>
In the method for providing a requested forward private line rate for a private line user<br>
according to the embodiments of the present invention, on the basis of providing the<br>
forward private line rate for the private line user, the residual timeslots out of the total<br>
forward transmit timeslots may also be used for providing forward data transmission<br>
processing for other non-private line users, thereby achieving a balance between the load<br>
borne by the system and the data transmission rates of the user terminals.<br>

embodiment of the present invention.<br><br><br>
Detailed Description of the Embodiments<br>
The method for providing a requested forward private line rate for a private line user<br>
according to an embodiment of the present invention provides assurable private line rates<br>
for some users firstly, then determines forward transmission rates for non-private line users<br>
according to the signal intensities reported by the non-private line users, so as to maximize<br>
the throughput of the forward transmission bandwidth as far as possible; and according to<br>
the requested reverse private line rates, the private line users increases their reverse<br>
transmission rates to the requested reverse private line rates by using the transition<br>
probability table indicated by the system, and the system transmits RAB indication to<br>
non-private line users so that the non-private line users can increase or reduce their reverse<br>
transmission rates, thereby achieving a balance between the load borne by the system and<br>
the data transmission rates of the user terminals.<br>
A method for providing a requested forward private line rate for a private line user<br>
according to an embodiment of the invention will be described in detail with reference to<br>
the accompanying drawings. Referring to accompanying FIG2, there is shown a flow<br>
diagram illustrating a method for providing a requested forward private line rate foring a<br>
private line user according to an embodiment of the present invention. The method in<br>
accompanying FIG2 includes the following processes:<br>
Process S10: Set a forward private line rate requested by a private line user. The<br>
corresponding forward private line rate is set according to the type of data communication<br>
service actually selected by the user.<br>
Process S20: Obtain a Data Rate Control (DRC) value of a location of the private line user<br>
through a test (an electric test is used in practice). The electric test refers to simulating<br>
usage status of a user in a corresponding location to test the intensity of the forward signal<br>
received by the user in the location.<br>
Process S30: Divide the forward private line rate requested by the user in process S10 by<br>
the DRC value of the location of the private line user to get a ratio of forward transmission<br>
timeslots to total forward transmission timeslots which meets the need of the forward<br><br><br>
private line rate of the user.<br>
As stated above, in the CDMA 1X EV-DO mobile communication system, the system uses<br>
Time Division Multiplex Access (TDMA) structure forwardly, and priorities of users and<br>
priorities of services are finally reflected by proportions of resources occupied by the users,<br>
i.e., the occupied proportions of timeslot resources. Therefore, in the CDMA 1X EV-DO<br>
mobile communication system, if a private line user intends to get a requested private line<br>
rate, the private line user must occupy enough timeslots out of the total forward<br>
transmission timeslots in the case of a given DRC value of the location of the user so as to<br>
assure the obtainment of the requested forward private line rate.<br>
The private line user mentioned here may be a fixed user (i.e. a mobile station user with a<br>
relatively fixed location) or a mobile user (i.e., a mobile station user which can move freely)<br>
in the CDMA 1X EV-DO mobile communication system. Since for some fixed users, their<br>
DRC values are relatively fixed, if the electric test is performed in the location of a private<br>
line user before the user opens an account, the forward transmission resources occupied by<br>
the user (the required forward transmission timeslots) when the private line rate for the user<br>
is met may be predicted.<br>
Referring to accompanying FIG 3, there is shown a schematic diagram illustrating forward<br>
transmission timeslots occupied by a user when the user intends to use a private line rate in<br>
the method for providing a requested forward private line rate for a private line user<br>
according to an embodiment of the present invention. Theoretical study indicates that the<br>
proportion of the forward resources (i.e. the proportion of the total forward transmission<br>
timeslots) occupied by each private line user is equal to a quotient obtained by dividing the<br>
private line rate of the private line user by the DRC value of the location of the user.<br>
Assuming in accompanying FIG 3 (a), the DRC value of the location of the private line<br>
user is 153.6Kbps, the actual private line rate requested by the user is 38.4Kbps, then when<br>
the private line user uses the private line rate, (the number of the forward transmission<br>
timeslots occupied by the user) /(the number of the total forward transmission timeslots) =<br>
38.4/153.6 = 1/4. As shown in the figure, one timeslot out of every four timeslots is<br>
specially used for transmitting the data forwardly for the private line user.<br><br><br>
Assuming in accompanying FIG 3 (b), the DRC value of the location of the private line<br>
user is 153.6Kbps, the actual private line rate requested by the user is 76.8Kbps, then when<br>
the private line user uses the private line rate, (the number of the forward transmission<br>
timeslots occupied by the user) /(the number of the total forward transmission timeslots) =<br>
76.8/153.6 = 1/2. As shown in the figure, two timeslots out of every four timeslots are<br>
specially used for transmitting the data forwardly for the private line user.<br>
Assuming in accompanying FIG 3 (c), the DRC value of the location of the private line<br>
user is 153.6Kbps, the actual private line rate requested by the user is 115.2Kbps, then<br>
when the private line user uses the private line rate, (the number of the forward<br>
transmission timeslots occupied by the user) /(the number of the total forward transmission<br>
timeslots) = 115.2/153.6 = 3/4. As shown in the figure, three timeslots out of every four<br>
timeslots are specially used for transmitting the data forwardly for the private line user.<br>
Assuming in accompanying FIG 3 (d), the DRC value of the location of the private line<br>
user is 153.6Kbps, the actual private line rate requested by the user is 153.6Kbps, then<br>
when the private line user uses the private line rate, (the number of the forward<br>
transmission timeslots occupied by the user) /(the number of the total forward transmission<br>
timeslots) = 153.6/153.6 = 1. As shown in the figure, all of the timeslots are specially used<br>
for transmitting the data forwardly for the private line user.<br>
Process S40: According to the ratio calculated in process S30, the system provides the<br>
requested forward private line rate for the private line user by using the corresponding<br>
timeslots out of the total forward transmission timeslots. As stated above, if the ratio<br>
calculated from the requested private line rate and the DRC value of the location of the user<br>
is 1/2, the system uses half of the total forward transmission timeslots for transmitting the<br>
data forwardly for the private line user so as to meet the need of the requested forward<br>
private line rate.<br>
The following processes should also be taken into account when the system provides the<br>
forward private line rate for the private line user.<br>
According to the ratio obtained in the above process S30, calculate the number of<br><br><br>
non-private line users to be limited for access in order to meet the need of the forward<br>
private line rates of all the private line users.<br>
Then according to the calculated number of the non-private line users, the system limits<br>
access of the calculated number of non-private line users so as to achieve the purpose of<br>
providing the requested forward private line rates for all the private line users.<br>
The method for providing a requested forward private line rate for a private line user<br>
according to an embodiment of the present invention needs to ensure access at any moment<br>
of the private line users based on the original system resource admission control, and to<br>
ensure that the private line users can obtain the requested forward private line rates after the<br>
private line users gain access. Therefore, it is required to limit the number of common users<br>
admitted for access by the system according to the status that the private line users occupy<br>
the forward transmission resources, thus ensuring that the load borne by the system is in a<br>
reasonable state.<br>
Considering a private line user's occupation of forward resources of the system, an electric<br>
test can be performed on the radio environment of the location of the private line user to<br>
obtain a corresponding DRC value which, in combination with the private line rate actually<br>
requested by the private line user, can be used to calculate a proportion of the forward<br>
transmission resources to be actually occupied by the user if the user intends to use the<br>
requested private line rate. Then whether the private line user can get the actual requested<br>
private line rate is determined according to the calculated proportion. If the system can<br>
meet the need of actual private line rate of the private line user, what is to be calculated is<br>
how many non-private line users (i.e. common users) should be limited for access due to<br>
the occupation of the forward resource by one private line user access, i.e. one private line<br>
user occupying forward transmission timeslots corresponds to how many non-private line<br>
users occupying the forward transmission timeslots. For example, in general, there are 30<br>
users in a cell who use the forward transmission resources of the system simultaneously. If<br>
a private line user in the cell using the requested forward private line rate occupies 1/2 of<br>
the forward transmission resources, the number of non-private line users supported by the<br>
residual forward transmission resources will be 30x(l-0.5) —15, i.e. the access of the<br><br><br>
private line user will limit the access of 15 common users.<br>
If the channel condition of a private line user is relatively bad, the private line user will<br>
occupy more forward transmission resources or even occupy so much forward<br>
transmission resources that the system is hard to bear. Therefore, the private line user is<br>
supported only when the location of the user is relatively fixed in a period of time, i.e., the<br>
private line user needs to be electrically tested before it opens an account so as to ensure<br>
that the account is opened only when the DRC value of the location of the user meets the<br>
account opening demand. That is to say, the system determines whether the forward private<br>
line rate can be provided for the private line user according to the calculated ratio of the<br>
forward transmission timeslots to be occupied to the total forward transmission timeslots<br>
which is required by the private line user for meeting the need of its forward private line<br>
rate. Ensuring that the DRC value of the location of the user meets the account opening<br>
demand means that the DRC value of the location of the user should be over N (N&gt;=1)<br>
times greater than the forward private line rate requested by the private line user, and the<br>
highest forward transmission rate actually applied to the user is required to reach the<br>
forward private line rate requested by the user when the electric test is performed. In this<br>
way, since the proportion of the forward transmission resources occupied by the private<br>
line user is a quotient obtained by dividing the forward private rate requested by the user by<br>
the DRC value of the location of the user, the proportion of the forward transmission<br>
resources occupied by the private line user will not exceed 1, to ensure that the forward<br>
transmission resources of the whole system will not be excessively exhausted by one<br>
private line user and to ensure the access of other users.<br>
The private line rate of the private line user may possibly not achieve the expected value<br>
due to the change of radio environment of the user after a long-term application and at this<br>
point the antenna needs to be adjusted. The system may stop serving the private line user<br>
when it is unable to provide the private line rate for the user, and resume providing the<br>
private line rate for the user when it is able to provide the private line rate again.<br>
Since the method for providing a requested forward private line rate for a private line user<br>
according to an embodiment of the present invention needs to firstly ensure access of the<br><br><br>
private line users, it is required that the base station on the system side can preferentially<br>
schedule a private line user through air interface resources to ensure that the private line<br>
user is preferentially scheduled. This can be done by multiplying the DRC value of the<br>
location of the private line user by a weight. During the process of the base station<br>
scheduling the private line user, multiplying the DRC value of the location of the private<br>
line user by a weight N is equivalent to increasing the DRC value of the location of the user<br>
by N times, thus ensuring that the private line user will be preferentially scheduled by the<br>
base station. Similarly, multiplying the DRC value of the location of the private line user by<br>
a sufficiently large weight can ensure that the private line user will be always scheduled by<br>
the base station. Of course, other scheduling strategies also may be used to ensure that the<br>
private line user is preferentially scheduled by the base station through air interface<br>
resources, and the detailed description is omitted here.<br>
The system may limit the forward transmission rate of a private line user to avoid the<br>
forward transmission rate of the user exceeding the requested private line rate. That is, the<br>
network side (such as Wireless Access Network, Core Network or IP network, etc.) may<br>
perform rate-limit control on the forward transmission rate of the private line user to ensure<br>
that the forward transmission rate of the user does not exceed the requested private line rate<br>
and to avoid the private line user excessively occupying the forward transmission resources<br>
of the system.<br>
In order to meet the requirements of some data services, a requested reverse private line<br>
rate of the user should be set simultaneously with the setting of the requested forward<br>
private line rate of the private line user so that the private line user can increase its reverse<br>
transmission rate according to a reverse transition probability table arranged by the system<br>
and hold the reverse transmission rate at the reverse private line rate when the reverse<br>
transmission rate reaches the reverse private line rate. That the private line user increases<br>
its reverse transmission rate to the reverse private line rate and holds the reverse<br>
transmission rate at the reverse private line rate can be realized in such a manner that the<br>
system sets the increase probability after the reverse transmission rate reaches the<br>
requested reverse private line rate of the private line user in the reverse transition<br><br><br>
probability table to zero, or in such a manner that the system sends a rate-limit signaling to<br>
the private line user after the system detects that the reverse transmission rate of the user<br>
reaches the set reverse private line rate, thus ensuring the reverse transmission rate of the<br>
private line user will not exceed the requested reverse private line rate and avoiding<br>
excessively occupying the resources of the system.<br>
Reverse transmission resources are managed by controlling transmission power of a user<br>
terminal to ensure that the information transmitted by the private line user is always<br>
demodulated correctly under a given reverse private line rate. The effect of this power<br>
control is substantially satisfactory according to practical applications. That is, no matter<br>
how far a private line user is from the base station (under normal coverage), the<br>
interferences of those users having the same reverse transmission rate with the base station<br>
are substantially the same (fluctuation may exist during the power-control process, but it<br>
can be ignored here); a private line user's interference with other users and its contribution<br>
to the reverse load of the base station are only related to the reverse transmission rate of the<br>
private line user and the current total load of the system.<br>
The above are just preferred embodiments of the invention. It is obvious to those skilled in<br>
the art that many variations and modifications may be made to the present invention<br>
without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention, and these variations<br>
and modifications should be deemed as falling within the scope of the present invention.<br><br>
