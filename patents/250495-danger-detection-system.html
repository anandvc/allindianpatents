Danger detection system<br>
Description<br>
The pnesent invention relates to a danger detection system having a -centre, a multiplicity of danger detectors connected to it and having an operating unit for operating the danger detectors, wherein the operating unit and the danger detectors are designed for two-way communication.<br>
So-called detector exchangers and detector testers are known for the rational use, exchange and for the functional checking of smoke detectors. Using the detector exchangers, fire detectors can be inserted into the detector base during commlsstoning and inspection by a pressing and rotating movement and removed from said base. The detector exchanger contains a so-called adapter mounted flexibly on a tubecoupling piece to which the detector can be fixed as with a-spanner, and extension tubes which make possible detector exchange up to a lieightof about 7 m. The detector tester may contain either acan containing a test gas or a hot-air generator (see, in this connection, for example US-A-3,€93,401 and the CERBERUS DZ1191 and^^ERBERUS Re6/RE6T detector testers of Siemens Building Technologies AG (CERBERUS is a registered trade mark of Siemens Building Technok)gies A
Detector exchangers/detector testers having a combined extract/test/extract head are also known in which light pulses are transmitted into the test chamber of a stray-light detector to be tested and the responder of the detector is checked for-said light pulses <see in this connection for example and also the cerberus dz1193 detector exchanger tester of siemens building technologies ag></see>
Whenever a detector is removed from its 43ase, the centre has to receive beforehand a message that the detector concerned is not in^ervrce and it must be informed after the exchange that an exchange has taken place. That means that, during servk^e work, the operating indivklual concerned has to-go to the centre before and after the detector exchange and has to submit the necessary informatbn items there in respect of which the servrce work is taking place at the detectors. The same applies to the checking of •detectors, in which case the centre must likewise-be informed accordingly so that the<br><br>
functional test does not trigger an alarm. It is obvious that this procedure is cumbersome and expensive, especially in the case of fairly large plants.<br>
The invention is now intended to provide a danger detection system of the type mentioned at the outset in which-service and maintenance work at the detectors*can be performed as simply and rationally as possible.<br>
This object is achieved by a danger detection system according to the features of Patent Claim 1. In the dependent claims, advantageous refinements and developments of the invention are specified.<br>
In the danger detection system according to the invention, the danger detectors are designed as connection nodes for communication between the operating unit and the centre. The operating unit is a mobile terminal that can be connected via any-danger detector to the centre and can communicate with the latter. As a result, the information items to be delivered during the exchange and during the checking of detectors to the centre can be inputted directly at the detectors concerned themselves and it is no tonger necessary that the operating individual has to go to the location of the centre to input -said information items.<br>
A suitable operating unit may be, for example, an operating module for a danger detector of the type described in€P-A-0 872 817. a device for the remote adjustment of parameters of a sensor of the type described in US-A-4;704.607.or a remote control of the type described in EP-A-1 158 840. Common to all these operating units is that they have an interface for bi-directional data communication with the danger detector concemed, said data communication being used to scan and/or remotely adjust the detector. The operating unit may, however, also be incorporated in a detector exchanger and/or detector tester of the type mentioned at the outset and form a component of it.<br>
The invention is described in greater detail below using an exemplary embodinnent and<br>
the drawings; in the drawings:<br>
Figure 1       shows a diagrammatic view of a fire-detection system and an operating<br>
unit for the in-«itu operation of the fire detector of the system; Figure 2       is a block diagram of a detail of the operating unit of "Figure 1; and Figures 3,4 are each a sketch of an applk:ation of the operating unit.<br>

Application No. 01 114 103.3 and a flame detector in EP-A-0 718 814.<br>
,1 The term operating unit 6 is to be understood generally. It may be a module after the<br>
fashion of a remote control for data communrcation with the detectors or a tool for<br>
replacing/inserting or checking detectors that can simultaneously be used for data<br>
communrcation. The operating unite shown in Figure 1 is a tool of the latter type and<br>
comprises a so-called detector tester and/or detector extractor (referred to as a testing<br>
extractor 7 below), which is a tool for checking the operation and/or for<br>
inserting/removing a detector into/out of a base, and a temninal 8 for inputting and<br>
displaying data.<br>
The testing extractor 7 essentially comprises a test/extracting head 9 that is mounted flexibly on a short tube 10, an^lectronte test system disposed in the testing/extracting head 9. a power supply, a function display and a main switch. Provided in the testing/ extracting head 9 and in the point detectors is, in-each case, an interface for bidirectional data communication between testing/extracting head 9 and detectors. Said interface is shown in Figure 2. To make it possible to operate the point detector 5 without aids up to a room height of 7 m, the tube 10 can be tetescopically extended by extension tubes (not shown). Suitable testing extractors 7, -but without the said communk:ations interface, are described in EP-A-0 BSe 266 andCP-A-0 971 ;^9.<br>
The left-hand half of Figure 2 shows the communrcations interface, denoted by the reference symbol KM, of a detector 5 and the right-hand half shows the communrcations interface of the testing/extracting head 9, denoted by the reference symbol MB. that are separated from one another by a broken line A symbolizing a transmission medium. Both communteatbns interfaces KM and KB^ach have an optrcal and an inductive channel KMo. KMj or K60, KBj. respectively. The optteal channel KMo of the detector communrcations interface KM contains an^externally visible alarm indicator 11 formed toy<br><br>
an LED for the optical indication of alarms and faults and an L€D driver 13 connected to a microproGessor 12 of the <letector. the optical channel kbo of testing and extracting head communications interface kb contains a photodiode an amplifier connected to it pulse shaper that is downstream whose output microprocessor operating unit.></letector.>
The inductive channel KB; of the testing/extracting head communications interface KB contains an oscillator IS controlled by the microprocessor 17 and an inductance 19 that is formed, for example, by a wire loop. The inductive channel KMi of the detector communications interface KM<x a resonant circuit demodulator connected to the latter downstream and pulse shaper that is whose output microprocessor wire loop inserted in testing head pushed onto detector containing for every transmission operation. photodiode disposed such way it acted on by light emitted alarm integrator can be achieved example mechanical encoding permits only relative position. of course also chosen plurality positions are possible. alternatively communications interface communication high-frequency range may preferably designed according bluetooth standard or infrared irda standard.></x>
In principle, the temiinal Scan te fixed to the tube 10 or to an extension tube and be designed in such a way that an operating individual-can simultaneously hold the testing/ extracting head 9 above the detector 5 to be operated and can operate the terminal 8, but, above a certain room height, this is only possible with difficulty. For this reason, the terminal 8 formed, for example by a hand-held unit or a PDA tpersonal digital assistant), is not attached to the tester/extractor 7 but is displaced from the latter and a communication connection, for example according to the IrDA standard or the Bluetooth standard, is provided between the terminal 8 and the testing/extracting head 9.<br>
To start a data transfer from the detector 5 to the testing extractor 7, the testing/ extracting head -9 is pushed onto the detector 5 and positioned on the latter. The detector is then set to a data transfer mode after a demand by the module communication interface KB. The data pass from the detector 5 to the testing extractor 7 and are stored therein and are indicated as coarse information^go/no go) in such a way<br><br>
that said information can also be read from a distance of 7 m. The testing extractor 7 is then removed from the detector 5 and the details of the stored data can be retrieved through the terminal 8 if this information is desired.<br>
The data transfer from the terminal 8 to the detector 5 proceeds analogously, a temporary storage in the testing extractor 7 likewise taking place. A data transfer in both directions is also possible. Of course, data once given into the terminal 8 can remain stored in the testing extractor 7 and be used repeatedly at various detectors,<br>
The detector can also independently set itself to the data transfer mode if the testing extractor 7 authentteates or klentifies itself as a permitted operating unit for data transfer. Said authentication can take place by means of special codes or cryptological methods. This prevents another or an unpermitted unit to set the detector inadvertently or deliberately to the data transfer mode.<br>
In the data transfer mode, on the one hand, the detector 5 can send the terminal 8 data picked up and stored during operation, for example near-alarms and the like and, on the other hand, data or commands, such as instructions in connection with service work or parameters, can be transmitted to the detector. In the data transfer mode, software updates may also possibly be undertaken. A very substantial advantage of the system disclosed having the operating unit 6 is that the data transfer mode can a^o be used to<br>
make a bidirectional connection between the operating unit€ and the centre 1 via.the<br>
' - &gt;<br>
detector concerned by, forexampte. informing the centre that service work is-being performed at the detector or requiring the centre to switch the detector to an appropriate mode or to write the concomitantly sent data into the detector.<br>
The indirect transfer of data or commands from the operating unit via the centre to the detector has the advantage over the direct transfer also possible that the<:entre is on the one hand concomitantly informed about changes undertaken in detector and other perfomn a filtering function can suppress not released for concerned.></:entre>
In partrcular, the possibility of two-way communication between centre and operating unit can be very helpful when installing a fire alarm system having a multiplicity of detectors by entering the associated room number at the operating unit and transmitting it from the detector to the centre, where the room number is then linked to the detector identification number (see. in this connection, EP-A-0 546 401) and the detector is consequently ctearly k)cated. As a result of the design of the detector as a connection node forcommunrcation between the operating unit and the centre, the operating unit<br><br>
can be connected as a mobile terminal via the danger detector concerned to the centre. This opens up the possibility of transferring functionality from the detectors to the centre.<br>
Since the system can be operated from every point, equipped with a detector, in the building, the time needed for commissioning and service work is reduced. In addition, operating ^errors can be avoided since the detector to be set to another mode does not have to be selected using a list {danger of choice of an incorrect^ntry or defective list) but is directly designated in situ.<br>
As is evident from-figure 1, the fire detection system contains, as a rule, not only point detectors 5 that are attached to the ceiling and for whose operation the testing extractor 7 was originally provided, but also special detectors, such as, for example, manual danger detectors 2, flame detectors 3 and line extinction detectors 4, which are mostly . attached to the wall. Although no special tool is in use for installing/deinstalling or detector testing for said detectors, said detectors also have to be tested in-situ periodically, in which case, it is also necessary to enter here in the centre in^achcase, before and after the test, that the detector concerned is being/was being tested and therefore has to be set to the test mode or to the normal operating state.<br>
In the system according to the invention, the operating unit-6 is designed in such a way that it can also be used to operate the said special detectors and other modules, figure 3 shows this multifunctionality of the operating unit 6 in connection with a manual danger detector 2, and figure 4 shows it in connection with a line extinction detector 4, an audible alarm unit 23 and with a so-called line module 24. Line modules are, for example, input/output modules for interfacing fire detectors of another type to an existing system or for interfacing normally-open or normally-closed contacts or for the decentralized activation of technical-devices, such as fire protection doors, ventilation systems, air-conditioning systems and the like, further line modules are the so-calted line separators that ensure that, in the event of a short circuit on a detector bus, the entire bus does not fail but only the defective part of a line is isolated. Said line modules have, as a rule, a slim, box-like shape and are often disposed in stacks r&gt;ext to one another so that there are certain restrictions in regard to accessibility from the outside.<br>
For manual danger detectors 2, the operating unit can be used without substantial PDodifK^ations. Manual'danger detectors are, as is known, mounted on the wall at a height of about 150 cm and have the shape of an approximately-square, slim box having a diameter that is about^ual to the diameter of a point detector S. As a i:esult, it is possible to hokl the testing-extractor 7 horizontally and place it on the manual-danger<br><br>
detector 2. Since an extension of the tube 10 is not necessary, the terminal 8 is advantageously attached to the tube 10, for example with an elastic clip. The testing/extracting head 9 is equipped with a module communication interface KB and the manual danger detector with a detector communications interface KM of the type shown in Figure 2. Since the testing extractor 7 is easy to manipulate with the short tube 10, it is unnecessary to perform the data communication in two steps. In such an arrangement, the distance of the wireless communication is greater than in the case of a point detector. This situation is detected by the testing extractor 7 (end switch), whereupon the sending power and reception sensitivity are increased.<br>
The line extinction detector 4 shown in Figure 4 has a metallically screened housing and therefore tends to be unsuitable for aoommunications interface of the type shown in Figure 2. The same applies to the line modules 24 that are accessible only at a narrow side owing to their an'angen&gt;ent in stacks so that, if the communications interface of Figure 2 were used, it would be uncertain under some circumstances which line module in a stack the operating unit 6 is specifically communicating with. The audible alarm unit 23 has the form of a round box. possibly with an embossed base, and can therefore be equipped with a detector communk:ations interface KM (Figure 2). The communication between the testing extractor 7 and the line extinction detector 4 and also the line module 24 takes place via an attachment cable 25 whose plugs are designed in such a way that they can also be conveniently plugged into line modules 24 disposed In stacks. In the case of the line extinction detector, the testing-extractor atso serves as an installation aid since the quality and the distance of the reflected optical signals are    r displayed online and the alignment of the housing is thereby simplified.<br>
Both in the embodiment of Figure 3 and also in that of Figure 4, theoommunteation takes place, in the same way as in "Figure 1, between terminal 8 and testing extractor 7 via an IrDA interface or via Bluetooth. Of-course, in the-cases of'Figures 3 and 4, the terminal 8 could also be connected by cable to the testing extractor 7. but then it would be necessary for these cases to have a special tool that cannot be universally used. The solution shown has. on the other hand, the advantage that the operating unit6 gives the nr^chanic a single tool for the operation of the various detectors and modules and, using said single tool, he can not only operate the detectors, but can alsocommunteate via them with the centre. A further advantage is in the use^of a standardized interface tlrDA or Bluetooth) so that the operating unit can readily be replaced by a commercial unit complying with the cunent state of the art.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
