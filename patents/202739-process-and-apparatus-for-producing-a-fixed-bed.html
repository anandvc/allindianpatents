COMPLETE SPECIFICATION [See Section 10]<br>
"PROCESS AND APPARATUS FOR PRODUCING A FIXED BED"<br>
VOEST-ALPINE INDUSTRIEANLAGENBAU GMBH &amp; CO.,  an Austrian company of Turmstrasse 44, A- 4020 Linz, Austria,<br>
1-8-2006<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br><br>
Ernrpqq and apparatus for producing	a fixed bed<br>
The invention relates to an apparatus and a process for producing a fixed bed in a metallurgical unit, preferably for producing pig iron or primary steel products from iron-containing charge materials, in particular in a melter gasifier, in which a lumpy bulk material, which contains ore-containing and carbon-containing constituents, in particular prereduced iron ore, preferably sponge iron, and, preferably lumpy, coal, is charged onto a surface, and thorough, preferably uniform mixing of the ore-containing constituent with the carbon-containing constituent of the bulk material takes place.<br>
The distribution of a lumpy bulk material over an expansive surface is a problem which is known to specialists in the field of plant construction and process technology. Particularly in the case of reactors used in chemical/physical process technology, considerable efforts are being made to achieve a bulk-material distribution which is optimized to a particular process. Incorrect loading of a reactor of this type can lead to a fall in the quality of the 2|5 product, to high losses caused by the extraction of dust and to a reduction in productivity of the plant as a whole. The distribution of material is an important instrument in particular for adjusting the gas distribution.<br>
In this respect, DE-C-19623246 describes an apparatus for the common, central introduction of coal and sponge iron into a melter gasifier. Although suitably thorough mixing of the substances is achieved, the central 3j5 introduction of the coal/sponge iron mixture has not proven advantageous, for both process engineering and economic reasons.<br>
In view of  the prior art,  it  is an object of  the<br>
1<br><br>
/-<br>
present invention to further develop a process according to the preamble of Claims 1 and 5 and an apparatus according to the preamble of Claim 8, so as to achieve a more economical process and a more economical plant engineering design compared to the prior art.<br>
According to the invention, the object set is achieved in accordance with the processes described in the characterizing part of [claims 1 and 5/and in accordance with the apparatus described in the characterizing part of Claim 8.<br>
The present invention has proven particularly advantageous when used in a melter gasifier and is documented in greatest detail in this connection. However, the use of the invention is not restricted to this embodiment, but rather the description of the actions in a melter gasifier merely represent an explanation given by way of example.<br>
A melter gasifier, as is known in the prior art, is used  to melt  an  iron ore  which  has  been  largely prereduced  (DRI),  and  to  produce  reduction  gas, 2|5  preferably from coal.<br>
The coal and the DRI are generally introduced into the melter gasifier via the dome of the gasifier; it has proven expedient for the coal to be introduced 3J0 centrally. Accordingly, the DRI is introduced into the melter gasifier via a "plurality of eccentrically located openings at the gasifier dome.<br>
The invention is also characterized by a process for producing a fixed bed in a metallurgical unit, preferably for producing pig iron or primary steel products from iron-containing charge materials, in particular in a melter gasifier, in which a lumpy bulk material,    which    contains    ore-containing    and<br>
2 <br><br>
/<br>
carbon-containing constituents, in particular prereduced iron ore, preferably sponge iron, and, preferably lumpy, coal, is charged onto a surface, and thorough, preferably uniform mixing of the ore-containing constituent with the carbon-containing constituent of the. bulk material takes place, in which method the entire ore-containing constituent is charged onto an active circumferential region (peripheral region) of the fixed bed, at which the thorough, preferably uniform mixing of the ore-containing constituent with the carbon-containing constituent of the bulk material takes place.<br>
In this context,  the active circumferential  region 10  refers to that region of the fixed bed through which gases pass uniformly in sufficient quantities for the production of pig iron and/or reduction gas.<br>
According to one feature of the invention, a coarse-20 grained fraction, in particular of the carbon-containing constituent, of the bulk material, which has a mean grain size which is greater than the mean grain size of the bulk material which is to be distributed, in particular of the carbon-containing constituent, is charged onto the centre of the surface, and in this way a, preferably steady state, predefined grain size distribution is produced.<br>
According to a further feature of the invention, the 30 bulk material, in particular the carbon-containing constituent of the bulk material, is distributed, via a charging apparatus, in a substantially rotationally symmetrical manner on the surface, less material than the amount which corresponds to the average at the other locations of the surface, between the centre and the outer edge of the active circumferential region of the fixed bed being applied to the centre of the surface by direct distribution.<br>
4<br><br>
/<br>
According to an additional feature of the invention, the coarse-grained fraction, in particular of the carbon-containing constituent, of the bulk material is for the time being applied to the fixed bed at a distance from the centre, in such a manner that, consequently, it is automatically charged onto the centre of the surface by indirect distribution, in particular segregation.<br>
10 According to a further embodiment of the process according to the invention, the lumpy bulk material is charged via one or more stationary charging apparatuses.<br>
15  Charging may take place directly or indirectly.<br>
By definition, direct charging means charging in which the bulk material in question, during its introduction, in particular into a reactor or a vessel, is loaded onto a predetermined region of a surface, in particular onto the centre of a surface.<br>
By definition, indirect charging means charging in which, although the bulk material is introduced by direct charging, the resulting distribution over the surface is determined by further effects, in particular by segregation. In this way, it is possible for the bulk material to be distributed and charged in a controlled way onto a specific region of the surface, 30 in particular onto the centre of the surface, even though this region has beefi omitted, or at least acted on to a lesser extent, by the direct charging, this being achieved for example by segregation i.e. indirectly.<br>
Accordingly, the direct and/or indirect charging establishes a grain size distribution which remains substantially constant as the process continues, i.e. behaves in a steady state, over the surface.<br>
5<br><br>
/-<br>
According to one feature of the invention, the expansive surface is a surface through which gases can pass, in particular through which gases actually pass, 5 process gas being guided in a controlled way through this surface. Passage of gas of this type is a significant feature of a corresponding process, for example the passage of gas through the fixed bed of a shaft furnace or melter gasifier.<br>
10<br>
20<br>
It is a significant object of the process according to the invention to establish the bed of the gasifier in a suitable way, in order to prevent quantitative, pressure and analytical fluctuations in the gas system above the bed. Since a melter gasifier, as well as generating the pig iron, is also used to produce reduction gas, irregular gas flows significantly impede its operation. These irregularities may even lead to the formation of gas fountains, which lead to a sudden expulsion of dust from the unit. The discontinuous expulsion of dust, as arises, for example, through sudden carbonization, places a load on the downstream units, in particular a reduction shaft furnace.<br>
30<br>
Especially in the case of processes in which gas is supplied from the side, below the bed, there is insufficient passage of gases through the centre of the reaction bed given a load in accordance with the prior art. The invention provides countermeasures which 30  significantly improve the process.<br>
The formation of the fixed bed in a melter gasifier differs significantly from the charging of, for example, a blast furnace, since a melter gasifier is on 35 the one hand a unit of a different specification, in particular different dimensions, and, on the other-hand, the melter gasifier is operated using a different method, in which different loading means from those used,  for example,  in  the  blast-furnace  method are<br><br>
used.<br>
In a preferred process of this type, the energy carriers used are carbon-containing solids, in particular coal, and 02-containing gas. According to the prior art, in this case the coal is conveyed out of a coal bunker using one or more worm conveyors and is added centrally, the coal therefore dropping in a narrow, concentrated jet through the gas chamber of the 10 melter gasifier onto the bed surface. Furthermore, it is also conceivable for the coal not to be added centrally to the fixed bed, but rather separately via a plurality of part-streams.<br>
l5 Working on the basis of the central introduction of the coal into the gasifier, the coal, on account of the characteristic of the worm conveying, does not drop onto the centre of the bed surface, but rather drops slightly eccentrically,  on account of the horizontal<br>
20     velocity of the worm discharge.<br>
On account of the tendency for the charge to accumulate at certain points, and on account of relatively fine particles and the tendency of the coal to agglomerate, 25 the passage of gas through the bed deteriorates at the central charging points. A cone of bulk material is formed and from time to time different volumes of this cone slip down suddenly into the circumferential region through which gases are passing. The coal passes into the hotter surrounding region and in the process is carbonized very rapidly.   '•"<br>
Quantitative gas fluctuations with pressure influences and  analytical  fluctuations  are  the  consequence, resulting in further adverse effects on the downstream gas system.<br>
Furthermore,  this slipping of  the coal  leads  to an uneven and asymmetrical distribution of material at the<br>
7<br><br>
circumference.  Continuous  heating  of  the  burden  is<br>
disrupted as a result, so that directly reduced iron<br>
(DRI)   is  heated  to  different  extents  at   the<br>
circumference,  and consequently it  is impossible to<br>
5  establish a uniform temperature profile. Fluctuations<br>
in the quality of pig iron and slag are the result.<br>
Local  differences  in  the  slag  composition  at  the<br>
circumference lead to disruption in the outgoing flow,<br>
and the desired slag composition in the hearth can only<br>
10  be established to an insufficient extent by mixing of<br>
the charge materials.<br>
The punctiform charging of coal into the central region of the bed surface which is customary when loading the 15 melter gasifier consequently leads to an uncontrolled formation of the bed surface and, depending on the segregation behaviour, to an unfavourable distribution of the various grain sizes of the bulk material.<br>
2	3  Preferably, with charging of this nature, the larger<br>
grain will move outwards. The gas which flows through the bed from below consequently tends to be forced towards the wall of the gasifier and to be distributed in an uncontrolled manner through the fixed-bed cross 25 section. High local gas velocities which may even lead to fountains being formed disturb the gas reactions in the gasifier dome and increase the discharge of dust. Consequently, there is a large area in the centre of the gasifier through which little gas flows. The volume<br>
3	0  of the active bed is therefore reduced, and the dead<br>
man in the centre or in' the hearth is primarily supplied with relatively fine grains, so .that the drainage deteriorates further.<br>
35 It is an object of the present invention for the coal not be charged onto one point in the gasifier, but rather for the coal to be scattered in a controlled way, with regard to its grain size, and in particular rotationally symmetrically,  onto the bed surface.  It<br>
8<br><br>
should also be ensured that more lumpy coal is charged into the centre of the bed than onto the surrounding region, since this configuration of the process has proven particularly expedient.<br>
It is a further significant object of the process according to the invention to establish the bed of the gasifier in a suitable way so as to prevent quantitative, pressure and analytic fluctuations in the<br>
l0 gas system above the bed. Since a melter gasifier, as well as generating the pig iron, is also used to produce reduction gas, irregular gas flows represent a considerable disruption to its operation. These irregularities may even lead to the formation of gas fountains, leading to sudden expulsion of dust from the unit. The discontinuous expulsion of dust as arises, for example, through sudden carbonization represents a load on the downstream units, in particular the reduction shaft furnace.<br>
20<br>
This object is achieved by the uniform distribution of the coal or of the material of the bulk material which is enriched with carbon, onto the fixed bed, and therefore by simultaneously more homogeneous mixing of<br>
25 the coal with the directly reduced iron (DRI), in particular the area of the centre being supplied with at most the same amount of coal as is broken down above the dead man, in order to prevent the formation of a cone of bulk material.<br>
In this case, particularly "in the case of simultaneous and continuous charging of the lumpy coal and of the prereduced iron ore, in particular of the sponge iron, as with the loading of a melter gasifier, the mixing 35  takes place particularly efficiently.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, less coal is applied by direct distribution to the centre of the fixed bed than the amount which is broken<br>
9<br><br>
down above the dead man, so that the bed level falls, and in this way relatively lumpy coal is charged to the centre of the bed through segregation, i.e. indirect distribution. The lower level of this type, as well as the more lumpy coal in the centre of the fixed bed, lead to a greater degree of gas injection at the centre, and therefore to an increase in the active bed volume for the chemical or metallurgical processes of the melter gasifier.<br>
The desired grain distribution at the bed of the melter gasifier can be achieved not only by indirect charging but also by direct charging, by which means the grain size distribution across the fixed bed is influenced in a controlled and direct manner. In this respect, consideration may be given to preliminary sorting of the bulk material according to grain size.<br>
Movable, generally rotatable charging apparatus are known in the prior art for the purpose of charging blast and shaft furnaces. These charging devices can be used to adjust the distribution of the burden and of the ore, in particular in the region of the upper shaft, to the requirements of the process in a 25  controlled way.<br>
Compared to the prior art, an immobile, steady-state charging apparatus according to the invention has various advantages:<br>
30<br>
A significant advantage in"this respect is the reduced susceptibility of the apparatus to mechanical and thermomechanical wear. Movable parts can only be used to a limited extent at elevated temperatures, since 35  adaptation requires a disproportionately high outlay.<br>
Furthermore, movable apparatus generally require a drive, which firstly in turn entails additional outlay on maintenance  and  secondly,  if  it  is  to  move  an<br>
10<br><br>
/<br>
apparatus which is able to withstand high temperatures and is robust, in particular specially reinforced, has to be dimensioned accordingly, and therefore requires a high outlay on energy.<br>
According to one feature of the present invention, the coal is scattered by inserting a charging apparatus which ensures substantially uniform, in particular rotationally symmetrical, charging over the char bed<br>
l0 surface into the falling jet of coal. Depending on the design of this charging apparatus, the surface profile can be set so that the flow of gas and solid in the fixed bed can be influenced in a controlled way. In particular, according to a further preferred embodiment<br>
15 of the invention, it is possible to carry out charging at a plurality of locations using one charging apparatus, by dividing the stream of bulk material.<br>
A movable design of a charging apparatus according to 20 the invention is also conceivable, so that individual regions of the surface, in particular of the fixed bed, are supplied with, in particular presorted, bulk material in a controlled way.<br>
The appropriate scattering and distribution of the coal over the bed surface in accordance with this process, with relatively lumpy coal being situated in the centre of a melter gasifier, through which the passage of gases tends to be worse, leads to the charged coal 30 being exposed to the hot gas more uniformly and being carbonized continuously. Stodden movements of material from cooler regions into hotter regions are prevented, and the production of gas is made more uniform or is stabilized. The scattering of the coal also prevents an irregular flow of the central cone of bulk material towards the outside.<br>
In this way, a homogeneous build-up of material on the char bed  (bed of  the .lumpy  coal)  is  ensured,  and<br>
11<br><br><br>
consequently not only the gas production but also the composition of the slag and pig iron at the circumference (active bed region) are made more uniform. This leads to more homogeneous guidance of the 5 slag, with an improved drainage performance. This in turn has positive effects on the heat exchanger function in the fixed bed and on the quality of the pig iron.<br>
10 The predetermined scattering of coal onto the char bed surface prevents the flow of material starting from a central cone of bulk material. Sudden, uncontrolled slipping of a relatively large volume of coal towards the outside is no longer possible.<br>
15<br>
The scattering of the coal onto the bed surface reduces the formation of agglomerates which disrupt the flow of material in the gasifier, since there is not an excessively great accumulation of material which is in 20  the same stage of pyrolysis.<br>
Furthermore, the scattering leads to uniform carbonization, since the coal is charged directly into the area through which gases pass and does not slip 25 down in an uncontrolled way, leading to sudden carbonization.<br>
The symmetrically and uniformly distributed coal has the further advantage that it is mixed homogeneously<br>
30 with the DRI at the circumference. Uniform quantities of pig iron and slag, as '-well as their approximately constant composition at the circumference, improve the metallurgical conditions in the gasifier bed above the oxygen nozzles.  Consequently,  the slag can flow out<br>
35 more easily and the gas passage and drainage conditions are improved.<br>
When using an immobile, steady-state, in particular undriven charging apparatus which is situated above the<br>
12<br><br><br>
centre of the gasifier, according to one embodiment of the invention, the coal is distributed, in particular rotationally symmetrically, over a large surface, without any coal being charged into the centre of the gasifier. Through segregation, the lumpy coal passes into the centre and into the area of the dead man. This has the result of the dead man being supplied with lumpy coal, so that the drainage is improved all the way to the tap. The DRI content in the area where the l0 heat flux is low on account of a low gas velocity (poor heat conduction) is to be kept low.<br>
Controlled formation of the char bed surface profile of this type and the regulated grain size distribution over the cross-sectional area allow the gas flow and the outgoing flow of the liquid phase to be influenced. The conditions for heat exchange in the fixed bed are improved, so that the energy consumption is reduced. Keeping the gas flow away from the wall protects the refractory lining.<br>
As a result of the centre of the melter-gasifier fixed bed being supplied with coarse lumps of coal, the dead man is formed with a relatively large void volume, so that it is possible to transfer increased quantities of heat into this region through the flow of gas and to allow the liquid phase to flow out in this region, and also to minimize the disruptions above the gasifier zone. Making the passage of gas more uniform reduces 30 the dust content in the process gas. Consequently, less dust is carried into the reduction shaft, the load on the dust recycling system is relieved and the losses of sludge in the process are reduced.<br>
35  According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, it  is  provided  to  fit  a  charging  apparatus  which divides the stream of bulk material into a plurality of part-streams,  so  that  in  this  way,  by  direct  or indirect distribution, more lumpy coal is charged into<br>
13<br><br><br>
the centre or at a different location which is predetermined by the process, in particular of the melter gasifier.<br>
Combinations of charging apparatuses which make use of direct and/or indirect distribution form further embodiments of the invention.<br>
10<br>
15<br>
The  invention  is  also  characterized  by  a  process according to the invention for distributing a lumpy bulk material,  in particular a lumpy coal,  from a stream of bulk material onto an expansive surface, in particular onto a fixed bed, this surface preferably extending within a reactor or vessel used in physical or chemical process engineering,  in particular in a reactor of a smelting plant for producing pig iron or primary steel products,  and the lumpy bulk material being charged via a charging apparatus,  the material being distributed radially outwards  -  as  seen from above - by a means for radial distribution, in which process,  furthermore,  the bulk material,  before  it comes  into  contact  with  the  means  for  radial distribution, is scattered at a means for scattering in the radial and tangential directions,  as seen from 25  above.<br>
According to one feature of the process according to the invention,  prior to the scattering of the bulk material, the stream of bulk material, in a, preferably first, step of the process, is centred, as a result of the stream of bulk material  being conveyed onto a centring means and the bulk material flowing through a number of centring openings of the centring means, any overflow of the bulk material which may occur flowing away  through  at  least  one  discharge  means,   in particular through a further opening.<br>
According to a further feature of the invention,  the bulk material  forms a cone of bulk material on the<br>
14<br><br>
centring means.<br>
According to an additional feature of the invention, a coarse-grained fraction of the bulk material which has a mean grain size which is greater than the mean grain size of the total distributed bulk, material is charged, in particular using segregation, onto a predetermined region of the surface, in particular onto a centre of the surface, a, preferably steady-state, predefined 10  grain size distribution being produced in this way.<br>
By definition, the term grain size distribution means the quantitative proportion of each grain fraction at a location with respect to the total quantity of grains at this location.<br>
By definition, what is known as a steady-state behaviour of the grain size distribution means that a grain size distribution which is approximately constant over time with respect to the particular location is present. Furthermore, according to a further embodiment of the invention, the quantity of grains of one fraction also, as a function of the location of the surface, presents a substantially time-independent behaviour in relation to the total quantity of the grains of the respective fraction on the surface.<br>
The invention is also characterized by an apparatus according to the invention for distributing a lumpy 30 bulk material, in particular a lumpy coal, from a stream of bulk material onto an expansive surface, in particular onto a fixed bed, this surface preferably extending within a reactor used in physical or chemical process engineering, in particular in a reactor of a smelting plant for producing pig iron or primary steel products, in which apparatus, to charge the lumpy bulk material, a charging apparatus is provided, which has at least one means for radially distributing the bulk material radially outwards - as seen from above - in<br>
15<br><br>
which apparatus, furthermore, the charging apparatus, upstream of the radial distribution means, has at least one means for scattering the bulk material, which is arranged in the upper part of the reactor and is preferably stationary, it being possible for at least a fraction of the bulk material to be distributed in the radial and tangential directions, as seen from above.<br>
The apparatus according to the invention leads to the l0  bulk  material,  in  a  first  step,  being  scattered uniformly and,  in a second step,  being distributed radially outwards.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment, the radial distribution is characterized in that a specific part of the surface is in the shadow of the radial distribution means and is therefore loaded with less bulk material. A scattering cone which is known in the prior art not only effects radial distribution but also 20 places a predetermined area of a surface under its shadow.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, the radial distribution means is designed as a fixed apparatus arranged beneath the scattering means.<br>
According to one feature of the apparatus according to the invention, the radial distribution means has a rotationally symmetrical part which tapers in the opposite direction to the flow of bulk material, in particular is conical, and*,' if appropriate, a rod-like part, the tapering part if appropriate centrally adjoining the rod-like part, as seen in the direction of flow of the bulk material.<br>
According to further embodiments, convex and concave structures, as well as substantially pyramid-shaped bodies, and also combinations thereof, are possible, provided  that  they  have  the  function  of  radially<br>
16<br><br>
distributing the bulk materials.<br>
The rod-like part of the radial distribution means, which is optionally present, is also used to fix and position the conical part.<br>
The conical part effects a radial distribution of the bulk material as a result of the bulk material rebounding off the lateral surface or sliding along this surface, and thereby being subjected to a specific distribution.<br>
In this case, that part of the surface, in particular of the fixed-bed surface, which is covered by and in the shadow of the cone or, in the case of the bulk material rebounding off and sliding down the cone lateral surface, its imaginary elongated lateral surface, is loaded with less bulk material by direct distribution than the quantity which would correspond to the cross section of the remaining part of the surface.<br>
According to a particularly preferred embodiment, the tapering part of the radial distribution means has at least one cone or truncated cone with an included angle between the generating line and the centre line of less than 60°, preferably in the range from 10-60°.<br>
The radial distribution means is made from 30 heat-resistant and wear-resistant material and/or has what are known as material cushions. At its base surface, the cone or truncated cone preferably has a diameter of 50% of the diameter of the scattering means or of the feed cross section.<br><br>
35<br><br>
According to one feature of the invention, at least one means for centring the flow of bulk material is provided upstream of the scattering means.<br><br>
17<br><br>
than that achieved in the prior art.<br>
According to the invention, the bulk material is distributed, the bulk material being distributed in a plane which is perpendicular to the direction of the flow of bulk material, or - as seen from above - in the radial and tangential direction.<br>
A scattering cone which is known in the prior art and 10 is disclosed, for example, in EP-A-0 076 472, by contrast, primarily effects distribution of the bulk material in - as seen from above - the radial direction within a tight ring.<br>
15 Furthermore, the scattering means according to the invention effects scattering, starting from the stream of bulk material, as seen from above, not only in the radially outward direction but also in the radially inward direction. The particular form of the tapering,<br>
20 in particular pyramid-shaped body, according to the invention, effects radial scattering, with a tendency, at any rate, for more material to be scattered outwards, over a greater radius, than inwards, over a small radius.<br>
2 5<br>
According to a further feature according to the invention, the scattering means has a number of approximately annular bodies, which approximately describe the shape of a body which tapers in the opposite direction to the direction of flow of the bulk material, and in particular., is in the shape of a cone.<br>
According to a particular embodiment, the annular bodies are connected to one another along one or more generating lines.<br>
According to a further feature, the scattering means must cover the entire cross section of the flow of bulk materia 1 .<br>
19<br><br>
material on the cone of bulk material which is brought about in this way, through the centring opening, results in a much lower mechanical or thermomechanical load on the apparatus. Furthermore, the centring means is made from materials which are able to withstand high temperatures and are highly wear-resistant.<br>
Non-limiting exemplary embodiments of the invention are explained  in  more  detail  below  with  reference  to 10  diagrammatic drawings, in which:<br>
Fig. 1 diagrammatically depicts the distribution<br>
of coal in a melter gasifier using the<br>
example   of   a   steady-state   charging<br>
15	apparatus<br>
Fig. 2 shows  an  exemplary  embodiment  of  a steady-state charging apparatus according to the invention. 20<br>
Fig. 1 shows a diagrammatic sketch of the distribution of coal in a melter gasifier 1. In this case, starting from a steady-state charging apparatus 2, the coal is introduced into the melter gasifier. In addition, there are an DRI introduction means 3, for example through a plurality of openings which are arranged concentrically with regard to the coal introduction means, a dust return means 4, an oxygen introduction means 5, and a slag and pig iron tap 15, as well as a gas discharge means 6 on the melter gasifier 1.<br>
The coal is distributed uniformly over the rotationally symmetrical bed 7 of the melter gasifier 1, the particular design of the charging apparatus 2 meaning 35 that no coal, or at least little coal, is charged to the centre. The distribution of the coal brought about by direct introduction is diagrammatically illustrated in Fig. 1, in which in particular a profile of the coal distribution    8    is    diagrammatically    sketched.<br>
19<br><br>
Accordingly, the mass flow rate at the surface which lies at approximately half the radius is significantly higher than in the centre of the bed.<br>
Segregation leads to a change in the coal distribution and, in particular, of the grain size distribution of the char bed, since larger, more lumpy coal slips down into the centre of the bed and in this way enters the zone of what is known as the dead man 9. In this way,<br>
l0 the dead man and hearth are supplied with relatively lumpy coal (chair) . The particular distribution of in particular the relatively lumpy coal leads to widening of the active char bed, which consequently leads to an increased passage of gases through the centre.<br>
15<br>
Fig. 2 diagrammatically depicts a steady-state charging apparatus 2 according to the invention. This charging apparatus has a metal concentrating sheet 10, which is used to concentrate the flow of bulk material, which is<br>
20 once again conveyed out of a bunker by conveyor worms. This metal concentrating sheet 10 is designed in such a manner that a haif, which is symmetrical with respect to an external diameter of the metal sheet, has been removed from an annular metal sheet. The metal concentrating sheet has a concentrating opening 11, as well as  an  opening  12  for discharging  the overflow.<br>
The design of the metal concentrating sheet according to the invention means that, irrespective of the centring opening of the metal concentrating sheet itself, a large part of the charging opening of the melter gasifier remains uncovered, thus allowing an overflow of bulk material.<br>
30 Below the metal concentrating sheet, the concentrated flow of bulk material is distributed by a scattering means 13, which in the present case is a coal channeler, a particular design of a deflector, uniformly into the free space or onto the surface of<br>
20<br><br>
the char bed of the melter gasifier. Tests have shown that the shape of the coal channeler has a considerable influence on the quality of the distribution of the coal onto the char bed, and the illustrated form of the coal channeler has proven particularly useful. In this case, the coal channeler 13 is approximately in the shape of a pyramid, thus enabling the bulk material to be scattered.<br>
Beneath the coal channeler 13 there is a radial distribution means 14, having a cone which stops the centre of the char bed from being fed or at least reduces the quantity of bulk material which is charged to this region. According to a further embodiment according to the invention, this cone may be attached to a cylindrical part and has, in particular, an included angle between generating line and centre line of approximately 10-60°. An included angle of 30° to 45° is particularly preferred.<br>
All parts of the apparatus presented above have to be adapted to the environmental conditions in their respective area of use. When used in a melter gasifier, primarily materials which are able to withstand high temperatures and have a high resistance to wear are used. Furthermore, consideration may be given to providing a refractory lining for those parts which are exposed to particularly high temperatures.<br>
Those parts of the apparatus presented above which experience has shown are exposed to a particularly high load caused by wear are additionally protected by cladding, for example by welding on metal sheets which are highly wear-resistant.<br>
