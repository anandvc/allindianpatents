				<td>This invention relates to a process for the manufacture of wet blue chrome tanned hide with no discharge of liquid effluent or toxic solid waste.<br>
Conventionally, hide is soaked twice in fresh water. This results in the use of double the volume of the soak-liquor than that required in the process according to this invention. Besides, the soak-liquor obtained in the conventional process contains a very high amount of total dissolved solid (TOS) and is usually sent for solar evaporation. However, the high amount of TDS makes solar evaporation difficult.<br>
Conventionally, liming is done in fresh water, in higher water-floats. The waste liquor from liming contains sodium sulphide , lime and protein waste which are very difficlult to treat<br>
Conventionally, reliming is done in fresh water with additions of chemicals including caustic soda/soda<br><br>
ash.      'I'he   process   according   to   this   invention dispenses with the reliming operation.<br>
Conventionally, deliming is done in higher water-floats, making effluent treatment difficult. In the process according to this invention, the deliming is done in dry-float.<br>
The disadvantages of the known processes used in the tanning industry are:<br>
a.	On an average a tannery consumes 25 litres of water<br>
for tanning one kg. of raw hide up to wet blue. This<br>
volume depletes scarce water resources of the<br>
country.<br>
b.	The percentage of chemicals used is directJy<br>
proportional to the volume of water used in the<br>
process. Accordingly, the consumption of chemicals<br>
is also high.<br><br>
c.	The   conventional   tannery   generates   solid   waste<br>
which   contains   every   chemical   discharge,   from<br>
chrome, salt, calcium, sulphide to organic   matters.<br>
This renders safe management	and beneficial<br>
disposal of the solid waste difficult.<br>
d.	While the appropriate authority has stipulated 2100<br>
Mg/litre as the permissible level of TDS, a vast<br>
majority of the tanneries fmd this difficult to adhere<br>
to, creating an uncertain future for them.<br>
c.	Effluent treatment plants (ICl Ps) of tanneries  are<br>
monitored by Govemment and this poses several problems to tannery units especially in rnceting various requirements laid down for such EIPs.<br>
()n the other hand, this invention has the following advantages:<br>
a.	The water consumption is as low as 2. 5 litres for<br>
processing 1 kg. of raw hide   into wet blue tanned<br><br>
hide, which is a ten time  reduction compared to the conventional consumption of water.<br><br>
b.	The use of the process according to this invention<br>
results in a 30 % of saving in basic chemicals, such<br>
as, sodium sulphide, lime and chromium sulphate,<br>
This invention ensures the total use of all the above<br>
chemicals as against only 70% offtake of the<br>
conventional system. Other than the cost saving of<br>
30% , the constituents of the solid waste is also<br>
correspondingly reduced.<br>
c.	The process according to this invention generates<br>
waste which is free from chrome sulphide and salt<br>
making it possible for beneficially using it for<br>
agriculture, since the basic ingredients are only<br>
organic matter and some amount of calcium and<br>
ammonia.<br>
d.	As there is no liquid effluent discharge, the question<br>
of TDS   does  not  arise.     This   is   a   substantial<br><br>
achievement inasmuch as the TDS of 2100 mg./litre<br>
stipulated by the appropriate authority is virtually<br>
impossible in a conventional tannery, e.        As there is no liquid effluent   or toxic solid waste<br>
discharge,   the  question  of monitoring  ETPs   by<br>
Government does not arise,<br>
f	An important consideration is that the quality of<br>
leather is greatly enhanced.<br>
Various other features of this invention will be discernible from the following further description.<br>
The process, according to this invention, for the manufacture of wet blue chrome tanned hide with no discharge of liquid effluent or toxic solid waste comprises the steps of taking the composite spent liquors obtained from the liming, deliming and pickling operations to an Internal ETP; treating the said composite liquors with a culture of microorganisms, such as herein described, producing bacterial proteases (enzymes) and bringing the pH to 8.5 to 9 . 5 and, thereafter, recycling the same for<br><br>
the soaking operation; evaporating the spent liquor,<br>
obtained after the soaking operation, to dryness;<br>
recovering the chrome from the spent liquor,<br>
obtained after the chrome tanning and finishing<br>
operation, in a CRP, for re-use, the supernatant<br>
liquor, after such recovery, being reused for the<br>
pickling operation; taking the wash liquor obtained<br>
before deliming and a part of the wash liquor<br>
obtained after deliming for carrying out the liming<br>
operation; taking the left over part of the wash<br>
liquor obtained after deliming together with tannery<br>
spillages and yard cleaning water to an External<br>
ETP for treatment and evaporation to dryness; and<br>
generating	biogas     from    the     fleshings,    by<br>
methanisation, to serve as a fuel.<br>
EXAMPLE<br>
The composite spent liquors which are obtained after the liming, deliming and pickling operations are taken to an In-Plant Effluent Treatment Plant (Internal ETP). The Internal ElV is an effluent treatment plant<br><br>
which is located within the boundary of the tannery yard or the leather processing area, so that the treated effluents can be recycled for leather processing; unlike the conventional external External Effluent IVeatment Plant (External EIT) where treated liquors are not taken back for leather processing, but let out into public waterways.<br>
In the Internal ETP, the composite spent liquors aforesaid are treated with microorganisms producing bacterial proteases (enzymes) and the pH is brought to a value of 8.5 suited for soaking of raw hides. The enzymes digest the unwanted unstructured proteins of the hide.<br>
The composite liquors treated as above in the Internal ETP are thus recycled for the soaking of raw hide, Thus, what would ordinarily have been discharged from the tannery into the External EIP is recycled for hide treatment.<br><br>
On the other hand, the spent liquor obtained after soaking is evaporated by solar evaporation or by known mechanical means, so much so nothing is left as liquid effluent after the soaking, liming, deliming and pickling operations.<br>
So also the spent liquor from the chrome tanning operation and subsequent finishing is taken to the chrome recovery plant (CRP) where the chrome content is totally recovered and reused in the tannery. The supernatant liquid is taken for the pickling operation.<br>
The CRP contains a collection sump, a reactor and a stirrer. The spent liquor remaining after the chrome tanning process, is taken through pipes to the collection sump. From the sump, the spent liquor is pumped to the reactor in which magnesium oxide is added to obtain a chrome precipitate. 1 his precipitate is taken to the stirrer wherein sulphuric acid is added during stirring. The output is "recovered chrome" which is re-used for chrome tanning.   The supernatant liquor,<br><br>
which is chrome-free  clear liquor  formed  in  the upper part of the reactor is reused for pickling.<br>
1 hus nothing is left as a liquid effluent after the chrome tanning operation.<br>
Washing of the hide is done at two stages, one before deliming and one after deliming , Ihe entire before deliming wash liquor is mixed with 50% of the after deliming wash liquor and re-used for liming.<br>
The left-over 50% of the after deliming wash liquor together with tannery spillages and yard cleaning water are taken to a small l!.xtemal IllV and treated. Being of very small volume, this liquid is solar evaporated to dryness.<br>
I'he tannery spillages and yard cleaning water along with 50% of after delime washing liquor taken to the small External ETP is treated in the following manner.:<br><br>
(i)	primary settling<br>
(ii)	aeration<br>
(iii)	secondary settling<br>
(iv)	solar evaporation<br>
1 annery spillages refer to water that might be spilled while conveying hides from one process location to another.<br>
Yard cleaning water refers to water used for cleaning processing machines such as tanning drums, paddles and fleshing machines; and water used for cleaning the tannery floor.<br>
Fleshing is a bye-product of the tanning industry, when producing wet blue leather from raw hide. Since fleshing is a proteinous matter, biogas is produced by methanisation of fleshing. The biogas thus produced is used as fuel for the generation of heat involved in mechanical evaporation (to which reference has been made herein) and other tannery<br><br>
operations.    An example of a known mechanical evaporator is one made of coiled pipes.<br><br><br><br><br>
