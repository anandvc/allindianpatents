This invention relates to the composition and utility of substituted naphthyl indole derivatives as inhibitors of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), and as therapeutic compositions for treating conditions resulting from fibrinolytic disorders such as deep vein thrombosis and coronary heart disease, and pulmonary fibrosis and to processes for their preparation.<br>
Background of Invention<br>
Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAH) is a major regulatory component of the plasminogen-plasmin system. PAI-1 is the principal physiologic inhibitor of both tissue type plasminogen activator (tPA) and urokinase type plasminogen activator (uPA). Elevated plasma levels of PAI-1 have been associated with thrombotic events as indicated by animal experiments (Krishnamurti, Blood, 69, 798 (1987); Reilly, Arteriosclerosis and Thrombosis, 11, 1276 (1991); Carmeliet, Journal of Clinical Investigation, 92, 2756 (1993)) and clinical studies (Rocha, Fibrinolysis, 8, 294, 1994; Aznar, Haemostasis 24, 243 (1994)). Antibody neutralization of PAI-1 activity resulted in promotion of endogenous thrombolysis and reperfusion (Biemond, Circulation, 91, 1175 (1995); Levi, Circulation 85, 305, (1992)). Elevated levels of PAI-1 have also been implicated in diseases of women such as polycystic ovary syndrome (Nordt, Journal of clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism, 85, 4, 1563 (2000)) and bone loss induced by estrogen deficiency (Daci, Journal of Bone and Mineral Research, 15, 8, 1510 (2000)). Accordingly, agents that inhibit PAI-1 would be of utility in treating conditions originating from fibrinolytic disorder such as deep vein thrombosis, coronary heart disease, pulmonary embolism, polycystic ovary syndrome, etc.<br>

Process of the Invention<br>
The compounds of the present invention can for example be prepared according to the following reaction schemes or modification thereof using readily available starting materials, reagents and conventional synthetic procedures. It is also possible to make use of variants of these process steps, which in themselves are known to and well within the preparatory skill of the medicinal chemist In the following reaction schemes, R1, R2, R3, R4, R5, R6, and R7 are selected from the groups defined above.<br>
In Scheme I, methoxy-naphthaldehydes (1) are converted to ketones 2 in a two step process. The first part utilizes Grignard chemistry to obtain an intermediate<br><br>
alcohol which is converted to the ketone via oxidation incorporating PCC or MnO2. Compounds 2 were then subjected to Fisher type indole syntheses to generate the naphthyl indole core structures (3) using either an aryl hydrazine or an N-arylhydrazone. In the case where the hydrazone was used, varied substitution can be introduced into the indole framework; hydrazones can be generated using a recent procedure from JACS, S.Wagaw; B. H. Yang; S. L Buchwald. JACS, 121, 1999, 10251-10263. At this point, the synthetic strategy can take one of two pathways, A and/or B. In Path A, naphthyl indoles 3 are N-alkylated (R6X equals alkyl halide such as methyl iodide) or N-acylated ((R6)2O equals anhydride such as acetic anhydride) to afford intermediates such as compounds 4. These compounds are demethylated using boron tribromide to produce naphthols 5. Compounds 5 are O-alkylated using a variety of alkyl halides and cesium carbonate in acetone to generate the precursor compounds 8 to the target acids (9). The Z group on compounds 8 is a acid precursor such as a carboxylic ester or nitrile which can be converted to the carboxylic acids or tetraazoles (9) via hydrolysis or tetraazole formation respectively. An alternative route to acids 9 incorporating Path B also starts with naphthyl indoles 3. These indoles are first demethylated with boron tribromide to produce naphthols 6. Compounds 6 are O-alkylated using a variety of alkyl halides and cesium carbonate in acetone to generate indoles 7. These compounds are /V-alkylated or N-acylated as in Path A to once again afford precursor compounds 8. At this point, Z groups are converted to the acids of compounds 9 as prevsiously described.<br><br><br>
This invention also provides pharmaceutical compositions comprised of substituted naphthyl indole derivatives (I) either alone or in combination with excipients (i.e. pharmaceutically acceptable materials with no pharmacological<br><br>
effects). Such compositions for treating conditions resulting from fibrinolytic disorder such as deep vein thrombosis and coronary heart disease, pulmonary fibrosis, etc.<br>
The precise dosage to be employed depends upon several factors including the host, whether in veterinary medicine or human medicine, the nature and severity of the condition being treated, the mode of administration and the particular active substance employed. The compounds may be administered by any conventional route, in particular enterally, preferably orally in the form of tablets or capsules. Administered compounds can be in the free form or pharmaceutically acceptable salt form as appropriate, for use as a pharmaceutical, particularly for use in the prophylactic or curative treatment of atherosclerosis and sequelae (angina pectoris, myocardial infarction, arrhythmias, heart failure, kidney failure, stroke, peripheral arterial occlusion, and related disease states). These measures will slow the rate of progress of the disease state and assist the body in reversing the process direction in a natural manner.<br>
Any suitable carrier known to the art can be used to prepare the pharmaceutical compositions. In such a composition, the carrier may be a solid, liquid or mixture of a solid and a liquid. Solid compositions include powders, tablets and capsules. A solid carrier can be one or more substances which may also act as a flavoring agent, lubricant, solubilizer, suspending agent, binder, or tablet disintegrant. In powders, the carrier is a finely divided solid, which is in admixture with the finely divided active ingredient. In tablets, the active ingredient is mixed with a carrier having the necessary binding properties in suitable proportions and compacted in the shape and size desired. Suitable solid carriers are magnesium carbonate, magnesium stearate, talc, sugar, lactose, pectin, dextrin, starch, gelatin, tragacanth, methyl cellulose, hydroxymethyl cellulose, sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, a low melting wax, cocoa butter, and the like. Encapsulating materials may also be employed with the compounds of this invention, and the term "composition" is intended to include the active ingredient in combination with an encapsulating material as a formulation, with or without other carriers. Cachets may also be used in the delivery of the anti-atherosclerotic medicament of this invention.<br><br>
Sterile liquid compositions include solutions, suspensions, emulsions, syrups and elixirs. The compounds of this invention may be dissolved or suspended in the pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, such as sterile water, sterile organic solvent or a mixture of both. Preferably the liquid carrier is one suitable for parental injection. Where the compounds are sufficiently soluble they can be dissolved directly in normal saline with or without the use of suitable organic solvents, such as propylene glycol or polyethylene glycol. If desired, dispersions of the finely divided compounds can be made-up in aqueous starch or sodium carboxymethyl cellulose solution, or in a suitable oil, such as arachis oil. Liquid pharmaceutical compositions, which are sterile solutions or suspensions, can be utilized by intramuscular, intraperitoneal or subcutaneous injection. In many instances a liquid composition form may be used instead of the preferred solid oral method of administration.<br>
It is preferred to prepare unit dosage forms of the compounds for standard administration regimens. In this way, the composition can be subdivided readily into smaller doses at the physicians direction. For example, unit dosages may be made up in packeted powders, vials or ampoules and preferably in capsule or tablet form. The active compound present in these unit dosage forms of the composition may be present in an amount of from about one gram to about fifteen grams or more, for single or multiple daily administration, according to the particular need of the patient. The daily dose of active compound will vary depending upon the route of administration, the size, age and sex of the patient, the severity of the disease state, and the response to the therapy as traced by blood analysis and the patients recovery rate. By initiating the treatment regimen with a minimal daily dose of about one gram, the blood levels of PAI-1 and the patients symptomatic relief analysis may be used to determine whether a larger dose is indicated. Based upon the data presented below, the projected daily dose for both human and veterinary use will be from about 25 to about 200 milligrams/kilogram per day, and more usually, from about 50 to about 100 milligrams/kilogram per day.<br>
The ability of the compounds of this invention to inhibit plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 was established by the following experimental procedures:<br><br>
Primary Screen for the PAI-1 Inhibition<br>
Test compounds are dissolved in DMSO at a final concentration of 10mM, then diluted 100X in physiologic buffer. The inhibitory assay is initiated by the addition of test compound (1 - 100 µM final concentration, maximum DMSO concentration of 0.2%) in a pH 6.6 buffer containing 140 nM recombinant human plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1; Molecular Innovations, Royal Oak, Ml). Following a 1 hour incubation at room temperature, 70 nM of recombinant human tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) is added, and the combination of test compound, PAI-1 and tPA is incubated for an additional 30 minutes. Following the second incubation, Spectrozyme-tPA (American Diagnostica, Greenwich, CT), a chromogenic substrate for tPA, is added and absorbance read at 405 nm at 0 and 60 minutes. Relative PAI-1 inhibition is equal to the residual tPA activity in the presence of test compound and PAI-1. Control treatments include the complete inhibition of tPA by PAI-1 at the molar ratio employed (2:1), and the absence of any effect of the test compound on tPA alone.<br>
Assay for determining IC50 of Inhibition of PAI-1<br>
This assay is based upon the non-SDS dissociable interaction between tPA and active PAI-1. Assay plates are initially coated with human tPA (10 µg/ml). Test compounds are dissolved in DMSO at 10 mM, then diluted with physiologic buffer (pH 7.5) to a final concentration of 1-50µM. Test compounds are incubated with human PAI-1 (50 ng/ml) for 15 minutes at room temperature. The tPA-coated plate is washed with a solution of 0.05% Tween 20 and 0.1% BSA, then the plate is blocked with a solution of 3% BSA. An aliquot of the test compound/PAI-1 solution is then added to the tPA-coated plate, incubated at room temperature for 1 hour, and washed. Active PAI-1 bound to the plate is assessed by adding an aliquot of a 1:1000 dilution of the 33B8 monoclonal antibody against human PAI-1, and incubating the plate at room temperature for 1 hour (Molecular Innovations, Royal Oak, Ml). The plate is again washed, and a solution of goat anti-mouse IgG-alkaline phosphatase conjugate is added at a 1:50,000 dilution in goat serum. The plate is incubated 30 minutes at room temperature, washed, and a solution of alkaline<br><br>
phosphatase substrate is added. The plate is incubated 45 minutes at room temperature, and color development is determined at OD405nm. The quantitation of active PAI-1 bound to tPA at varying concentrations of test compound is used to determine the IC50. Results are analyzed using a logarithmic best-fit equation. The assay sensitivity is 5 ng/ml of human PAI-1 as determined from a standard curve ranging from 0-100 ng/ml.<br>

The IC50 was determined by the Antibody Assay described above.<br>
The IC50 was determined by a modification of the Primary Screen for PAI-1<br>
