Related Patent Applications<br>
This patent application claims priority of a provisional application, U.S. Ser. No.<br>
60/483,847 which was filed on June 30, 2003.<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to processes for the production of silicone monomers<br>
and particularly bis(trimethylsilyloxy)silylalkyl glycerol methacrylates.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Various silicone containing monomers have found utility as starting materials in the<br>
production of medical devices, such as ophthalmic devices and particularly, soft contact<br>
lenses having improved permeability to oxygen. One class of suitable monomers includes<br>
tris and bis(trimethylsilyloxy)silylalkylglycerol methacrylates ("SiAGMA"). One process<br>
for making SiAGMA includes reacting the epoxide of the SiAGMA with methacrylic acid<br>
and either the sodium, potassium or ithium salt of methacrylic acid and an inhibitor, such as<br>
hydroquinone monomethyl ether. Reaction conditions include heating for about 15 hours,<br>
and yields SiAGMA having a purity of between about 75 to 95% and a number of<br>
byproducts, including dimethacrylatod byproducts. When included in the monomer mixes<br>
used to make ophthalmic devices such as contact lenses, the dimethacrylated byproducts can<br>
act as crosslinkers, which even in snail quantities can change the modulus of the resulting<br>
device. Accordingly, the concentration of these difunctional byproducts must either be<br>
tightly controlled or minimized. Removal of the difunctional byproducts is conventionally<br>
done by a cumbersome silica gel colmn chromatography step.<br>
Thus, there remains in the an for an improved process for the production of<br>
SiAGMA type compounds., and particularly one which minimizes the formation of<br>
difunctional byproducts.<br><br>
The present invention relates; to a process comprising the steps of reacting a<br>
substituted epoxide, and preferably a silicone containing substituted epoxide with at least<br>
one lithium acrylic acid salt, at least one acrylic: acid and optionally at least one inhibitor at a<br>
5 temperature above about 60°C to form a substituted hydroxy acrylate. Specifically, the<br>
present invention relates to a process comprising the step of reacting a first reaction mixture<br>
comprising substituted epoxide with at least one lithium salt, at least one acrylic acid at a<br>
temperature above about 60°C for up: to about one day to form a substituted hydroxy acrylate<br>
and said substituted epoxide<br>
)<br>
Description of the Invention<br>
Suitable substituted epoxides include those of Formula I, below:<br>
i <br>
Wherein R1 is any substituent which would not react with a nucleophilic compound.<br>
Preferred epoxides include those shown in Formula II, below:<br><br>
)<br>
Wherein R2 is a CI to CI2 alkyl substituted with at least one Si containing moiety and<br>
preferably at least one silicone. Suitable Si containing compounds include compounds of the<br>
formula III:<br>
&gt; wherein A1 and A2 are the same or different and are selected from lower alkyl, alkyloxy and<br>
B;<br><br>
3 is lower alkyl, alkoxy or a group cf the structure:<br><br><br>
wherein R3, R4, R5, R8 and R9 are the same or different and are selected from the group<br>
including lower alkyl, phenyl, benzyl, and tri-alkyl siloxy substituents and y is an integer<br>
from I to 25. As used herein the term "lower allcyl" refers to alkyl groups comprised of 1 to<br>
4 carbon atoms.<br>
Specific examples of suitable epoxides include those of formula IV:<br><br>
Wherein R6 and R7 are independently selected from alkyl groups having 1 to 4 carbon atoms,<br>
n is an integer between 1 and 12 and c is an integer between 0 and 3. Even more<br>
specifically, the epoxide may be the epoxide of (3-<br>
glycidoxypropyl)bis(trimethylsiloxy)methylsilane.<br>
Epoxides may be formed in a number of ways including, but not limited to, oxidation<br>
of alkenes with peroxyacids, formation by an intramolecular SN2 reaction of halohydrins,<br>
addition of a nucleophilic oxidizing agent (such as a basic solution of hydrogen peroxide) to<br>
an a,P-unsaturated carbonyl compound, and the reaction of a sulfonium ylide with a<br>
carbonyl compound. Alternatively, epoxides substituted with a Si containing group may be<br>
prepared by the hydrosilylation of an already formed epoxide containing an olefmic<br>
functionality. Such methods are well known to those skilled in the art and this list of<br>
synthetic routes to epoxides and epoxides substituted with a 3i containing group, in no way<br>
limits the scope of this invention to these preparations.<br>
According to the process of ths present invention the epoxide is reacted with at least<br>
one acrylic acid and at least one lithium salt of said acrylic acid. Suitable acrylic acids<br>
comprise between 1 and 4 carbon atoms. Preferably said acid is methacrylic acid. The<br><br>
reaction between the epoxide and the acrylic acid may be equimolar, however, it may be<br>
advantageous to add an excess of acrylic acid. Accordingly, the acrylic acid may be used in<br>
amounts between about 1 and about 3 moles of acrylic acid per mole of the epoxide.<br>
The lithium salts of the present invention comprise lithium and at least one acrylic<br>
acid comprising between 1 and 4 carbon atoms. Preferably said lithium salt is the Li salt of<br>
methacrylic acid. The lithium salt is added in an amount sufficient to catalyze the reaction, and<br>
preferably in an amount up to about 0.5 equivalents, based upon the epoxide.<br>
An inhibitor may also be included with the reactants. Any inhibitor which is capable<br>
of reducing the rate of polymerization may be used. Suitable inhibitors include sulfides,<br>
thiols, quinines, phenothiazine, sulfur, phenol and phenol derivatives, mixtures thereof and<br>
the like. Specific examples include, but are not limited to hydroquinone monomethyl ether,<br>
butylated hydroxytoluene, mixtures thereof and the like. The inhibitor may be added in an<br>
amount up to about 10,000 ppm, and preferably in an amount between about 1 and about<br>
1,000 ppm.<br>
The reaction is conducted at elevated temperatures, preferably greater than about 60°C<br>
and more preferably between about 80 'C and about 110°C. Suitable reaction times include up<br>
to about a day, preferably between about 4 and about 20 hours, and more preferably between<br>
six hours and about 20 hours. It will bi; appreciated by those of skill in the art the temperature<br>
and reaction time are inversely propoit onal, and that higher reaction temperatures may allow<br>
for decreased reaction times and vice vsrsa. However, in the process of the present invention it<br>
is desirable to run the reaction to or near completion (for example, greater than about 95%<br>
conversion of substituted epoxide, and preferably greater than about 98% conversion of<br>
substituted epoxide).<br>
It has been found that b / using lithium as the metal ion in the salt, less<br>
impurities are generated at a. given set of reaction conditions. Thus, the puessnl indention<br>
provides a process for the production of substituted hydroxy acrylates in higher purities than by<br>
conventional methods. The substituted hydroxy acrylates may be further purified using super<br>
critical fluid extraction. Suitable extraction fluids are non-reactive with the silicone<br>
containing compounds to be purified and have critical points below the range which would<br><br>
cause degradation of the silicone containing compound. Examples include carbon dioxide,<br>
ethane, ethylene, propane, propylene, chlorotriiluoromethane, mixtures thereof, and the like.<br>
Carbon dioxide is a preferred supercr tical fluid because it has a low critical point, is<br>
generally non-reactive with the silicone-containing compounds, non-flammable and<br>
environmentally benign.<br>
Suitable conditions include one or more separation zones, where the supercritical fluid<br>
in the first zone comprises a density between about 0.5 and 0.7 g/ml and a density of 0.1<br>
g/ml to about 0.3 g/ml. The desired censities may be achieved by controlling the pressure<br>
and temperature within the reaction zane. Any number of additional separation zones may<br>
be included.<br>
In order to illustrate the invention the following examples are included. These<br>
examples do not limit the invention. They are meant only to suggest a method of practicing<br>
the invention. Those knowledgeable in contact lenses as well as other specialties may find<br>
other methods of practicing the invention. However, those methods are deemed to be within<br>
the scope of this invention.<br>
