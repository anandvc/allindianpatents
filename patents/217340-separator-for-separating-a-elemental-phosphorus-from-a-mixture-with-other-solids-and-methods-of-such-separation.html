				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>This invention relates to an apparatus and a method for separating a solid that can be melted from a mixture with other solids. In particular, it relates to the separation of elemental phosphorus from phosphorus bearing sludges by melting the phosphorus in the sludge inside a screened container.<br>
In processing phosphate rock to obtain phosphorus for use in making fertilizers, detergents, and other products, vast quantities of unuseable sludge is also produced. Since this sludge contains elemental phosphorus, it must be stored in ponds to prevent the spontaneous ignition of the phosphorus in air. Maintaining the ponds is costly, creates legal and environmental problems, and is a loss of valuable phosphorus.<br>
The phosphorus in the ponds can be recovered using mobile sumps -large, open-bottomed tubes. The sumps are forced down into the pond sediment and steam is sparged into the sediment inside the sump, melting the phosphorus. The sediment is pumped out of the sump and the melted phosphorus is separated from the remaining solids by gravity settling and filtration.<br>

(A)     placing said mixture in said container of a separator according to any one of the preceding claims; and<br>
(B) heating said fluid to a temperature above the melting point of said meltable solid, whereby said meltable solid flows through said screen out of said container and said unmelted other solids do not.<br>
Preferably said meltable solid is elemental phosphorus and said fluid is heated to a temperature above 44.1°C.<br>
In order that the invention may be more readily understood, and so that further features thereof may be appreciated, the invention will now be described, by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawing which is a diagrammatic side view showing a preferred embodiment of an apparatus in accordance with the invention.<br>
In the drawing, a separator 1 according to this invention has a tank 2 in which is placed a horizontal cylindrical container 3 having a screened portion 4. Tank 2 is filled to level 5 with a liquid 6, such as water, which can be heated by means of heater 7. The axis 8 of container 3 is at an adjustable angle a to the horizontal. Container 3 can be rotated about its axis 8 by means 9, such as an electric, hydraulic, or air motor, or engine. Sludge, sediment, or other mixtures of solids 10 can be admitted to the inside of container 3 through input 11. (An annular solid ring, not shown, over that end of container 3 prevents<br>
material from spilling out.) Melted solids 12 flow through the openings in screened portion 4 of container 3 and collect in cones 13, which can be opened using valves 14. Unmelted solids 15 gradually tumble down container 3 and are removed by means of dewatering screw conveyer 16.<br>
This invention can be used to treat any mixture of solids that contains at least one solid that melts at a lower temperature than the other solids from which it is to be separated (or the other solids may not melt). Examples of such mixtures include elemental phosphorus in phosphorus sludge and hydrocarbons in petrochemical sludge. The mixture preferably contains elemental phosphorus and various high melting or infusible solids. For example, the phosphorus can be in a mixture with dirt, furnace slag, rock, sand, clay, and debris. Water is usually also present to keep the phosphorus from spontaneously igniting. A typical mixture from the production of elemental phosphorus from phosphate rock contains about 1 to about 40 wt% elemental phosphorus.<br>
The screened container can have any shape suitable for holding unmelted solids while permitting melted solids to escape. A cylindrical shape is preferred as a cylinder is self-cleaning, but other shapes, such as that of a cone or a rotated ellipse or parabola, can also be used. The cylinder can be<br>
made of many flat panels for better mixing and easier repair. If a cylinder is used, its axis is preferably at an angle a of between about 0 and about 5 degrees to the horizontal, so that solids move down the cylinder as it rotates. Alternatively, the cylinder can be fitted with screw flights, which will move material along the cylinder as it is rotated. The cylinder can have any dimensions, but a cylinder about 0.6 to about 2.4 m (about 2 to about 8 feet) in diameter and about 3.7 to about 12 m (about 10 to about 40 feet) long is practical for many materials. The container can be made of a variety of materials, including aluminum and various plastics; steel is the preferred material due to its strength and durability.<br>
At least some portion of the container is screened (where the melted solid is to flow out) but other portions can be unscreened to provide mechanical support or for other reasons. The openings in the screened portion should be large enough that they do not plug frequently but small enough to minimize the size of the solid particles that pass through and must be handled by the downstream equipment. A practical range for many types of materials is about 0.2 to about 0.6 cm (about 0.06 to about 0.25 inches) in diameter. The openings in the screened portion can become larger or smaller along the length of the cylinder so that the distribution of the melted phosphorus and inert solids to the various cones is controlled.<br>
The container is preferably rotated or otherwise agitated to aid in separating the melted solids from the unmelted solids. To minimize splashing, wear, and vibration, the container is preferably rotated at less than 10 rpm. It can also be vibrated, but this is generally not necessary. The container is at least partially immersed in the liquid in the tank; the portion not immersed can be in an inert atmosphere to prevent the spontaneous ignition of the phosphorus.<br>
The mixture is heated to a temperature above the melting point of the meltable solid 01 solids that are to be separated, but below the melting point of any solids or solids that are not to be separated. If the meltable solid is elemental phosphorus, for example, the mixture should be heated to about 50°C as elemental phosphorus melts at 44.1°C Heating is most conveniently accomplished by placing the screened container in a bath of a hot fluid. While the fluid can be an inert gas, such as carbon dioxide or nitrogen, it is preferably a liquid, such as water or an organic solvent, e.g., methanol, or toluene. If phosphorus is the meltable solid, the liquid is preferably water as it is inexpensive, non-toxic, and easy to work with. If a heavy liquid such as brine is used, the phosphorus will float out of the container instead of sinking to the bottom.<br>
The mixture can be added to the screened container either in batches or continuously, but continuous addition and removal of the meltable solid is preferred as processing is easier, more efficient, and more economical. It is also possible to heat the mixture in one step, melting the meltable solid, then place the mixture into the screened container for separation in a separate step, but this is not preferred.<br>
