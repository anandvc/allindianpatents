This invention relates to a rain guard for use on a latex bearing tree during rubber tapping operations.<br>
Rain guards are used on latex bearing trees during the rainy season to prevent rain water from flowing through the tapping zone of the tree and from mixing with the latex, tapped from the trees. The rain guards, once installed on such trees, just before the start of the rainy season, are kept in place until the rainy season is over. Thereafter the rain guards may be removed from place and stowed away until the next rainy season commences. Sometimes, the rain guards are not removed from the trees, even after the rainy season, but retained in place, to generally act as a protective cover over the tapping zone and the latex collection receptacle.<br>
The known rain guard comprises a skirt-member for closely encircling the trunk of the latex bearing tree, partly or fully. Means are provided for firmly positioning the skirt member on the trunk to provide an awning for the periphery of the trunk just above the said  tapping zone. A cowl extends outwardly  from  the<br><br>
skirt-member to overhang the receptacle-<br>
Tapping operation is done on a latex bearing tree during early hours of the day by a skilled person. The latex obtained by the above process is collected in a receptacle. when the receptacle on each tree gets filled with latex, the latex is collected in a vessel or the receptacle is replaced by a fresh, empty one. However, when the person attending to this job bends down near the tapping zone for carrying out the tapping operation, as well as for collecting the latex or replacing the receptacle, there is every possibility of the pointed corner-portions of the end of the cowl, poking or scratching the hands, eyes or other parts of the face of such person, thereby resulting in avoidable injury to him or to her.<br>
This  invention therefore proposes a rain  guard  which is free from the abovementioned defect.<br>
The  rain guard for use on a latex bearing  tree  above the  rubber  tapping  zone  and  the  latex  collection<br><br>
receptacle   thereof,  according  to  this   invention,<br>
comprises  a  skirt-member for closely  encircling  the<br>
trunk  of  the tree, partly or fully,  with  means  for<br>
firmly positioning itself thereon to provide an  awning<br>
for the periphery of the said trunk just above the said<br>
tapping  zone; and a cowl extending outwardly from  the<br>
skirt-member   to  overhang  the   said   receptacle,<br>
characterised  in that the end of the cowl  has corner<br>
portions of a smooth curvature. This invention will now<br>
be  described  in further detail by  referring  to  the<br>
accompanying drawings, which illustrate in<br>
Fig.l one of known forms of the rain guard in plan view<br>
Fig.2 illustrates the known rain guard fastened to  the<br>
trunk of the tree above the rubber tapping zone<br>
Fig. 3 illustrates, by way of example and not by way of<br>
limitation, an embodiment of this invention<br>
Fig. 4 illustrates the embodiment illustrated in  Fig.3<br>
fastened  to  the trunk of the tree  above  the  rubber<br>
tapping zone<br>
and Fig. 5 illustrates, by way of example and  not  by<br>
way  of   limitation,  another  embodiment  of   this<br>
invention.<br><br>
The known rain guard (Figs. 1 and 2) for use above the rubber tapping zone Z and the latex collection receptacle R thereof, has a skirt-member S for closely encircling the trunk T of the tree, partly or fully, with means for firmly positioning itself thereon to provide an awning for the periphery of the said trunk just above the said tapping zone.<br>
The cowl C extends outwardly from the skirt-member to overhang the said receptacle.<br>
However, the end of the cowl has pointed corner-portions at E, which are likely to scratch or poke the eyes or face (or other parts of the body) of the worker coming into contact with the said corner portions. To obviate this drawback, the rain guard proposed herein does not have pointed corner portions at E of Fig.l. On the other hand, the corner portions E (fig.l) have a smooth curvature (that is, for example, a non-pointed or non-jagged curvature) at Rl (see Figs 3 to 5) to avoid the hazards of being scratched or poked. i1lustrative of the curvatures that can be used are those  of  an  ellipse, a circle and so on.  With  the<br><br>
proposed rain guard in use, the worker will thus be enabled to carry out the latex tapping operation without risk of any injury.<br>
The ends Ml and M2 of the skirt-member S surrounding the trunk of the tree are fastened together or to the said trunk by known means. Since these ends are located away from the tapping zone, there is little possibility of the worker at the tapping zone being injured by the corner-portions R2 of these ends. Nonetheless, such cornersâ€”portions, if the need arises, will also be assigned a smooth curvature.<br>
The terms and expressions in this specification are of description and not of limitation, since various other embodiments of the rain guard proposed herein are possible without departing from the scope and ambit of this invention.<br><br><br><br><br>
