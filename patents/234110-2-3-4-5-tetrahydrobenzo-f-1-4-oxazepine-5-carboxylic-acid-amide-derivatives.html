2,3,4,5-Tetrahydroben2o[f|[l,4]oxazepine-5-carboxylic acid amide derivatives as gamma-secretase inhibitors for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease<br>
The invention relates to benzoxazepinone derivatives of formula<br><br><br><br><br>
and o is 1 or 2;<br>
and to pharmaceutically suitable acid addition salts thereof with the exception of 4-benzyl-3-oxo-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-benzo[f] [l,4]oxazepine-5-carboxyiic acid phenethyl-amide, 4-benzyl-3-oxo-2&gt;3,4,5-tetrahydro-benzo[f] [l,4]oxazepine-5-carboxylic acid butylamide, 4-cyclohexyl-3-oxo-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-benzo[f] [l,4]oxazepine-5-carboxylic acid phenethyl-amide and 4-cyclohexyl-3-oxo-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-benzo[f] [l,4]oxazepine-S-carboxylic acid butylamide.<br>
The excluded compounds have been specifically described in /. Org. Chem., 199% 64, 1074-1076 for a process using bifunktional starting materials containing aldehyde and carboxylic acid.<br>
As used herein, the term "lower alkyl" denotes a saturated straight- or branched-chain alkyl group containing from 1 to 6 carbon atoms, for example, methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, i-butyl, 2-butyl, t-butyl and the like. Preferred lower alkyl groups are groups with 1-4 carbon atoms.<br>
The term "cycloalkyl" denotes a saturated carbocyclic group, containing 3-7 carbon atoms.<br>
The term "halogen" denotes chlorine, iodine, fluorine and bromine.<br>
The term "lower alkoxy" denotes a group wherein the alkyl residues is as defined above, and which is attached via an oxygen atom.<br><br>
The term "pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts" embraces salts with inorganic and organic acids, such as hydrochloric acid, nitric acid, sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid, citric acid, formic acid, fumaric acid, maleic acid, acetic acid, succinic acid, tartaric acid, methane-sulfonic acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid and the like.<br><br>
It has b een found that the compounds of general formula I are y-secretase<br>
inhibitors and the related compounds-may be useful in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.<br>
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia in later life. Pathologically AD is characterized by the deposition in the brain of amyloid in extracellular plaques and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles. The amyloid plaques are mainly composed of amyloid peptides (Abeta peptides) which originate from the (3-Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP) by a series of proteolytic cleavage steps. Several forms of APP have been identified of which the most abundant are proteins of 695, 751 and 770 amino acids length. They all arise from a single gene through differential splicing. The Abeta peptides are derived from the same domain of the APP but differ at their N- and C-termini, the main species are of 40 and 42 amino-acid length.<br>
Abeta peptides are produced from APP through the sequential action of 2 proteolytic enzymes termed [3- and y-secretase. (3-Secretase cleaves first in the extracellular domain of APP just outside of the trans-membrane domain (TM) to produce a C-terminal fragment of APP containing the TM- and cytoplasmatic domain<br>
(CTF(3). CTF(3 is the substrate for y-secretase which cleaves at several adjacent positions<br>
within the TM to produce the A peptides and the cytoplasmic fragment. The majority of<br>
Abeta peptides is of 40 amino acids length (Ap40), a minor species carries 2 additional amino acids at its C-terminus. Latter is supposed to be the more pathogenic amyloid peptide.<br>
The -secretase is a typical aspartyl protease. The y-secretase is a proteolytic activity consisting of several proteins, its exact composition is incompletely understood. However, the presenilins are essential components of this activity and may represent a new group of atypical aspartyl proteases which cleave within the TM of their substates and which are themselves polytopic membrane proteins. Other essential components of<br>
y-secretase may be nicastrin and the products of the aphl and pen-2 genes. Proven<br>
substrates for y-secretase are the APP and the proteins of the Notch receptor family,<br>
however, y-secretase has a loose substrate specificity and may cleave further membrane proteins unrelated to APP and Notch.<br><br>
The y-secretase activity is absolutely required for the production of Abeta peptides. This has been shown both by genetic means, i.e., ablation of the presenilin genes and by low-molecular-weight inhibitory compounds. Since according to the amyloid hypothesis or AD the production and deposition of Abeta is the ultimate cause for the disease, it is thought that selective and potent inhibitors of y-secretase will be useful for the prevention and treatment of AD.<br>
Thus, the compounds of this invention will be useful treating AD by blocking the activity of y-secretase and reducing or preventing the formation of the various amyloidogenic Abeta peptides.<br>
Numerous documents describe the current knowledge on y-secretase inhibition, for example the following publications:<br>
Nature Reviews/Neuroscience, Vol. 3, April 2002/281, Biochemical Society Transactions (2002), Vol. 30. part 4, Current Topics in Medicinal Chemistry, 2002, 2, 371-383, Current Medicinal Chemistry, 2002, Vol. 9, No. 11, 1087-1106, Drug Development Research, 56, 211-227, 2002, Drug Discovery Today, Vol. 6, No. 9, May 2001,459-462, FEBS Letters, 483, (2000), 6-10, Science, Vol. 297, 353-356, July 2002 and<br>

The present compounds of formulas I and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts	(<br>
can be prepared by methods known in the art, for example, by processes described below, &gt;    which processes comprise<br>
a) reacting a compound of formula<br><br>
with a compound of formula<br>
R4-NH2  III<br><br>
and with a compound of formula<br><br>
to a compound of formula<br><br>
and<br>
if desired, converting the compounds obtained into pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts.<br>
The compounds of formula I maybe prepared in accordance with the following scheme 1:<br><br>
In this scheme R1 to R are as described above.<br>
A general synthesis of the benzoxazepinone skeleton is described in Zhang et al.: J. Org. Chem. 1999, 64, 1074 ff. The corresponding o-hydroxybenzaldehyde (V) is reacted with the alpha-bromocarboxylic acid alkylester (VI) to the 2-formylphenoxyacetic acid alkylester (VII), which is subsequently saponified to the 2-formylphenoxyacetic acid (II).<br><br>
This acid is reacted with the amine (III) and isonitrile (IV) in an Ugi-type reaction to the benzoxazepinone derivative of formula I.<br>
The starting materials (hydroxybenzaldehyde V and a-bromoesters VI) are commercial available or may be prepared in accordance with known methods.<br>
The detailed description can be found below and in Examples 1 - 196.<br>
Some compounds of formula I may be converted to a corresponding acid addition salt, for example compounds, containing an amine group.<br>
The conversion is accomplished by treatment with at least a stoichiometric amount of an appropriate acid, such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid, nitric acid, phosphoric acid and the like, and organic acids suchas acetic acid, propionic acid, glycolic acid, pyruvic acid, oxalic acid, malic acid, malonic acid, succinic acid, maleic acid, fumaric acid, tartaric acid, citric acid, benzoic acid, cinnamic acid, mandelic acid, methanesulfonic acid, efhanesulfonic acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid, salicylic acid and the like. Typically, the free base is dissolved in an inert organic solvent such as diethyl ether, ethyl acetate, chloroform, ethanol or methanol and the like, and the acid added in a similar solvent. The temperature is maintained between 0 °C and 50 °C. The resulting salt precipitates spontaneously or maybe brought out of solution with a less polar solvent.<br>
The acid addition salts of compounds of formula I maybe converted to the corresponding free bases by treatment with at least a stoichiometric equivalent of a suitable base such as sodium or potassium hydroxide, potassium carbonate, sodium bicarbonate, ammonia, and the like.<br>
The compounds of formulas I and their pharmaceutically usable addition salts possess valuable pharmacological properties. Specifically, it has been found that the<br>
compounds of the present invention may inhibit the y-secretase.<br>
The compounds were investigated in accordance with the test given hereinafter.<br>
Description of y-secretase assay<br>
The activity of test compounds can be evaluated in assays which measure the proteolytic cleavage of suitable substrates by y-secretase activity. These can be cellular<br>
assays where e.g., a substrate of the y-secretase is fused in its cytoplasmic domain to a transcription factor. Cells are transfected with this fusion gene and a reporter gene, e.g., firefly luciferase, which expression is enhanced by the transcription factor. Cleavage of<br><br>
the fused substrate by y-secretase will lead to expression of the reporter gene which can be monitored in appropriate assays. The y-secretase activity can also be determined in cell-free in vitro asays where e.g., a cell lysate containing the y-secretase complex is incubated with a suitable APP-derived substrate which is cleaved to the Abeta peptides. The amount of produced peptides can be determined with specific ELISA assays. Cell lines of neuronal origin secrete Abeta peptides which can be measured with the specific<br>
ELISA assay. Treatment with compounds which inhibit y-secretase leads to a reduction of secreted Abeta thus providing a measure of inhibition.<br>
The in vitro assay of y-secretase activity uses a HEK293 membrane fraction as a source of<br>
y-secretase and a recombinant APP substrate. Latter consist of the C-terminal 100 amino acids of human APP fused to a 6xHistidin tail for purification which is expressed in E.coli in a regulatable expression vector, e.g. pEtl5. This recombinant protein corresponds to<br>
the truncated APP fragment which results after y-secretase cleavage of the extracellular<br>
domain and which constitutes the y-secretase substrate. The assay principle is described in Li YM et al, PNAS 97(11), 6138-6143 (2000). Hek293 cells are mechanically disrupted and the microsomal fraction is isolated by differential centrifiigation. The membranes are solubilized in detergent (0.25 % CHAPSO) and incubated with the APP substrate. The<br>
Abeta peptides which are produced by y-secretase cleavage of the substrate are detected by specific ELISA assays as described (Brockhaus M et al, Neuroreport 9(7), 1481-1486 (1998).<br>
The preferred compounds show a ICso-T.O. In the list below are described some data to the y-secretase inhibition:<br><br><br>

  I<br>
The compounds of formula I and the pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compounds of formula I can be used as medicaments, e.g. in the form of pharmaceutical preparations. The pharmaceutical preparations can be administered orally, e.g. in the form of tablets, coated tablets, dragees, hard and soft gelatine capsules, solutions, emulsions or suspensions. The administration can, however, also be effected rectally, e.g. in the form of suppositories, parenterally, e.g. in the form of injection solutions.<br>
The compounds of formula I can be processed with pharmaceutically inert,<br>
inorganic or organic carriers for the production of pharmaceutical preparations. Lactose,<br>
corn starch or derivatives thereof, talc, stearic acids or its salts and the like can be used,<br>
for example, as such carriers for tablets, coated tablets, dragees and hard gelatine<br>
capsules. Suitable carriers for soft gelatine capsules are, for example, vegetable oils, waxes,<br>
fats, semi-solid and liquid polyols and the like. Depending on the nature of the active<br>
substance no carriers are, however, usually required in the case of soft gelatine capsules.	<br>
Suitable carriers for the production of solutions and syrups are, for example, water, polyols, glycerol, vegetable oil and the like. Suitable carriers for suppositories are, for example, natural or hardened oils, waxes, fats, semi-liquid or liquid polyols and the like.<br>
The pharmaceutical preparations can, moreover, contain preservatives, solubilizers, stabilizers, wetting agents, emulsifiers, sweeteners, colorants, flavorants, salts for varying ' the osmotic pressure, buffers, masking agents or antioxidants. They can also contain still other therapeutically valuable substances.<br>
Medicaments containing a compound of formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof and a therapeutically inert carrier are also an object of the present invention, as is a process for their production, which comprises bringing one or more compounds of formula I and/or pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts and, if<br><br>
desired, one or more other therapeutically valuable substances into a galenical administration form together with one or more therapeutically inert carriers.<br>
In accordance with the invention compounds of formula I as well as their pharmaceutical^ acceptable salts are useful in the control or prevention of illnesses based on the inhibition of the y-secretase, such as of Alzheimer's disease.<br>
The dosage can vary within wide limits and will, of course, have to be adjusted to the individual requirements in each particular case. In the case of oral administration the dosage for adults can vary from about 0.01 mg to about 1000 mg per day of a compound of general formula I or of the corresponding amount of a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. The daily dosage may be administered as single dose or in divided doses and, in addition, the upper limit can also be exceeded when this is found to be indicated.<br><br>
