				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a clamping apparatus, comprising a<br>
clampinq chuck and a work piece carrier adapted to be releasably attached to<br>
the clamping chuck, having a flat bottom surface and comprising a clamping pin<br>
protruding from the flat bottom surface. The clamping chuck comprises a central<br>
opening with a conical inserting portion for receiving the clamping pin of the work<br>
piece carrier. The clamping pin comprises at least one surface portion<br>
corresponding in shape to the shape of the conical inserting portion of the central<br>
opening for aligning the position of the clamping pin in X- and/or in Y-direction.<br>
Moreover, the clamping chuck is provided with a clamping mechanism for fixing<br>
the clamping pin of the work piece carrier in the central opening, and at least one<br>
surface portion serving as a Z-direction stop member.<br>
Such a clamping apparatus is preferably used for clamping work piece<br>
carriers carrying one or several work pieces to be machined in the machining<br>
area of a machine tool in a well defined and predetermined position. Usually, the<br>
clamping chuck of the apparatus is fixed in the machining area of the machine<br>
tool, while the work piece carrier, provided with a clamping pin, is releasabiy<br>
attached to the clamping chuck.<br>
In order to be in a position to clamp work pieces with different dimensions,<br>
so-called palletizing systems are known which comprise a plurality of clamping<br>
chucks, usually two, four, six or eight of them. By means of these plurality of<br>
clamping chucks, a work piece carrier equipped with, depending on its size, two,<br>
four, six or eight clamping pins can be clamped. In certain cases, it may happen<br>
that the work piece ca+rrier is equipped with an odd number of clamping pins.<br>
Since an individual clamping chuck usually has neither means to avoid rotation<br>
nor means for determining the angular position of the clamping pin of the<br>
clamping pin around the Z-axis, it would be advantageous to provide one or a<br>
plurality of clamping chucks with positioning means, for determining, besides the<br>
X- and Y-positions, also the angular position around the Z-axis. With this<br>
arrangement, if appropriate, workpiece carriers having only one clamping pin<br>
also can be clamped to the clamping chuck in an exactly defined linear and<br>
angular position. !t is to be understood that in such a case also the work piece<br>
carrier has to be provided with positioning means cooperating with the above<br>
mentioned positioning means of the clamping chuck.<br>
A difficulty observed particularly in connection with large work piece<br>
carriers is that a required coarse aligning of the clamping pins of the work piece<br>
carrier with the corresponding openings in the clamping chucks is pretty difficult<br>
because there is only a small clearance between the front portion of the<br>
clamping pin and the opening in the clamping chuck adapted to receive the<br>
clamping pin. Moreover, there is a danger that both the clamping pin and the<br>
opening in the clamping chuck may be damaged.<br>
In addition to clamping apparatuses in which the clamping pin is provided<br>
with a cylindrical portion for its positioning within the opening of the clamping<br>
chuck, other clamping apparatuses are known in the art in which the clamping<br>
chuck is provided with a conical centering surface area for a clearance-free<br>
aligning of the clamping pin.<br>
For example the document EP 1,044,760 discloses a clamping apparatus<br>
of this kind. In this clamping apparatus, the clamping pin is aligned by means<br>
of a conical centering surface provided at the top of the opening of the clamping<br>
chuck. The housing wall of the clamping chuck is axially resilient in the region of<br>
this conical centering surface ; for this purpose, a radial cutout is provided<br>
behind the conical centering surface. Thereby, an elastically resilient area is<br>
created, which enables the clamp-<br>
ing pin to be axially moved and to be pulled in further in 2-<br>
direction after having been centered. ELastically resilient sur-<br>
face areas of this kind have shown to be efficient particularly in<br>
small clamping apparatuses. However, in the case of clamping appa-<br>
ratus adapted to receive large and heavy work piece carriers, the<br>
clamping chuck is lastingly weakened by the provision of such a<br>
cutout. Moreover, it is not possible to provide a Z-reference or a<br>
Z-direction stop member in the area around the above mentioned<br>
cutout since the clamping apparatus is too resilient in Z-<br>
directoin in that area. Finally, there is a danger that the elas-<br>
tically resilient area is damaged upon inserting the clamping pin<br>
into the clamping chuck because the eiastically resilient area<br>
cannot bear high loads neither in axial nor in radial directions.<br>
The document DE 41 10 857 discloses an apparatus for coupling<br>
a tool holder to a working spindle of a machine tool. The working<br>
spindle is provided with an opening for receiving a shaft portion<br>
of the tool holder. The opening has an upper and a lower conical<br>
portion with an annular recess having a supporting surface located<br>
between the two conical portions. The shaft portion of the tool<br>
holder is equipped with two cone rings supported by elastic abut-<br>
ments. Between the two cone rings, a locking mechanism is located,<br>
comprising two radially movable locking pieces. On the top, these<br>
locking pieces are provided with wedge shaped surface areas which<br>
rest in the locked state on the supporting surface of the annular<br>
recess. By providing the elastic abutments, the cone rings are<br>
axially movable relative to the shaft portion of the tool holder<br>
and enable the shaft portion to be pulled in into the opening af-<br>
ter the cone rings having been rested on the conical portions of<br>
the opening. The cone rings themselves are provided with slots.<br>
The shaft portion is provided with a flange portion constituting<br>
at its lower end a flat annular surface serving as a Z-direction<br>
stop member, resting on the front face of the working spindle upon<br>
clamping the shaft portion. In the opening of the working spindle,<br>
both conventional clamping pins (Fig. 5 of said document) and sectional<br>
clamping pins (Figs. 1 and 3 of said document) can be clamped. Thus, the basic<br>
idea of the invention may be seen in the fact that work piece carriers with<br>
differently designed clamping pins can be clamped by the working spindle of the<br>
machine tool. It is understood that such a clamping apparatus is not at all<br>
suitable for attaching a work piece holder to the working spindle of a machine<br>
tool in a highly precise and repeatable manner.<br>
U.S.Patent No. 5,722,806 discloses a coupling system that includes a<br>
male coupling having a cylindrical distal end including a recess that includes<br>
follower surfaces, a female coupling having a cylindrical interior for receiving the<br>
distal end of the male coupling, and a pair of opposing jaw members movably<br>
mounted within the interior and including external cam surfaces for engaging the<br>
follower surfaces of the male coupling when the jaw members are radially moved<br>
apart, and a drive train for radially and forcefully moving the jaw members apart.<br>
The drive train includes a wedging ball that freely floats in recesses between the<br>
opposing jaw members, and a drive rod for axially moving the wedging ball into<br>
and out of engagement with wedge surfaces located in the interior of the jaw<br>
members. The drive rod includes a distal end having a bore for slidably receiving<br>
the wedging ball. The freefloating of the wedging ball within the drive rod bore<br>
and between the internal surfaces of the jaw members allows it to apply uniform<br>
wedging forces to the jaw members when spreading them apart into a coupling<br>
position.<br>
U.S.Patent No. 5,918,870 discloses a device for detachable fastening of<br>
work pieces to be machined on a processing machine having a pallet on which<br>
the work pieces are detachably fastened, and which can be connected<br>
detachably via this pallet to the processing machine, wherein the locking<br>
between the pallet and one or more quick-clamp cylinders is effected through at<br>
east one pull-in bolt which are fastened on the pallet and which engage in<br>
clamping manner in corresponding receptacles on the quick-clamp<br>
cylinder, and wherein the clamping connection is maintained<br>
through tension springs, and for unlocking a hydraulic piston can<br>
be actuated which overcomes the clamping force of the tension<br>
springs, wherein in the quick-clamp cylinder the space between the<br>
central pull-in bolt and the tension springs arranged to the side<br>
of the latter is sealed.<br>
U.S.Patent No. 5,415,384 discloses an apparatus for clamping<br>
a work piece comprising a base and a work piece carrier adapted to<br>
be put onto and fixed to the base. The base and the carrier com-<br>
prise aligning means to align the position of the carrier relative<br>
to the base along three perpendicular coordinate axes as well as<br>
the angular position. The aligning means comprises first aligning<br>
element pairs in the form of cooperating reference surfaces at the<br>
carrier and the base, which define the position of the carrier in<br>
the Z-axis. The aligning means further comprises second and third<br>
aligning element pairs in the form of cooperating linear aligning<br>
element pairs, which define the position of the carrier in the X<br>
and Y-axes, respectively. The cooperating pairs each comprise a<br>
wedge-shaped centering member and a counterpart member with a<br>
matching centering slit. Clamping means is provided for clamping<br>
the carrier to the base in a well defined position which is de-<br>
fined by the aligning means. The clamping means comprises a plu-<br>
rality of clamping members, each including a pin member fixed to<br>
the carrier and a chuck member located in the base. The carrier<br>
comprises a flat surface which faces the base if the carrier is<br>
clamped to the base. The flat surface forms one of the reference<br>
surfaces. Each one member of the second and third pairs is di-<br>
rectly connected to the flat surface. Each pin member is also di-<br>
rectly connected to the flat surface.<br>
It is an object of the invention to provide a clamping appa-<br>
ratus with a clamping chuck and a work piece carrier releasably<br>
connected thereto whose clamping chuck is particularly suitable<br>
for palletizing systems, whereby the individual clamping chuck shall be very<br>
robust and rigid.<br>
It is a further object of the invention to provide a clamping apparatus with<br>
a clamping chuck and a work piece carrier releasably connected thereto in which<br>
the clamping pin is aligned in X- and/or Y-direction without any clearance.<br>
It is a still further object of the invention to provide a clamping apparatus<br>
with a clamping chuck and a work piece carrier releasably connected thereto in<br>
which a movement of the clamping pin and, thereby, the work piece carrier in Z-<br>
direction is possible after the clamping pin has been aligned in X- and/or Y-<br>
direction, without the need to provide separate elastically resilient means.<br>
In order to meet these and other objects, the present invention provides a<br>
clamping apparatus, comprising a clamping chuck, a work piece carrier adapted<br>
to be releasably connected to said clamping chuck, having a flat bottom surface<br>
and comprising a clamping pin, protruding from said flat bottom surface, said<br>
clamping chuck having a central opening for receiving said clamping pin of said<br>
work piece carrier and having a conical inserting portion, said clamping pin<br>
having at least one surface portion corresponding in shape to the shape of said<br>
conical inserting portion of said central opening for aligning the position of said<br>
clamping pin in X- and/or in Y-direction, and said clamping chuck also comprising<br>
a clamping mechanism for fixing said clamping pin of said work piece carrier in<br>
said central opening, and at least one surface portion serving as a Z-direction<br>
stop member, characterized in that said clamping pin is dimensioned such<br>
that, prior to activating said clamping mechanism, a gap exists between<br>
said flat bottom surface of said work piece carrier and said surface portion of<br>
said clamping chuck serving as a Z-direction stop member after said clamping<br>
pin of said work piece carrier is inserted into said central opening of said<br>
clamping chuck with said at least one surface portion of said clamping pin having<br>
engaging said conical inserting portion of said central opening and thereby<br>
aligning said clamping pin with reference to said clamping chuck in X- and/or Y-<br>
directions, whereby at least one of said clamping pin and the region around said<br>
central opening of said clamping chuck is adapted to be elastically deformed<br>
upon activation of said clamping mechanism to further pull in said clamping pin<br>
into said central opening and simultaneously said work piece carrier towards said<br>
surface portion of said clamping chuck serving as a Z-direction stop member<br>
until said flat bottom surface of said work piece carrier rests on said surface<br>
portion of said clamping chuck serving as a Z-direction stop member.<br>
Thus, the basic idea of the invention may be seen in the fact that the<br>
clamping pin is designed in such a way that it can align itself without clearance in<br>
X- and/or Y-direction upon insertion into the opening of the clamping chuck<br>
without the work piece carrier resting on the clamping chuck. In other words,<br>
during that aligning of the clamping pin, a small gap remains between the bottom<br>
surface of the work piece carrier and the top surface of the clamping chuck. This<br>
gap is removed when the clamping pin is further pulled in into the opening of the<br>
clamping chuck by means of the clamping mechanism, whereby the elasticity of<br>
the material of the clamping pin and/or of the region of the clamping chuck<br>
around the central opening is used for that purpose. Thereby, the work piece<br>
carrier is moved in Z-direction towards the clamping chuck until its flat bottom<br>
surface rests on the Z-direction stop member constituted by the corresponding<br>
surface areas on top of the clamping chuck. In this way, the provision of means<br>
that are elastically resilient in Z-direction can be totally avoided.<br>
In the following, an embodiment of the apparatus according to the<br>
invention will be further described, with reference to the accompanying drawings,<br>
in which:<br>

carrier;<br>
Fig. 2 shows a first longitudinal sectional view of the clamping chuck and<br>
of the work piece carrier;<br>
Fig. 3 shows a longitudinal sectional view of the clamping chuck with the<br>
work piece carrier loosely put on;<br>
Fig. 4 shows a longitudinal sectional view of the clamping chuck with the<br>
work piece carrier clamped thereto;<br>
Figs. 5 to 7 show perspective views of different embodiments of clamping<br>
pins;<br>
Fig. 8 shows a perspective view of a machining table and of a pallet; and<br>
Figs. 8a and 8b each show an enlarged view of clamping pins according<br>
to Fig. 8.<br>
Fig. 1 shows a perspective view of a schematically illustrated clamping<br>
apparatus. The clamping apparatus comprises a clamping chuck generally<br>
designated by reference numeral 1 and a work piece carrier generally<br>
designated by reference numeral 40. The work piece carrier 40 is provided with<br>
a clamping pin 30 by means of which the work piece carrier 40 can be fixed to<br>
the clamping chuck 1. Such a clamping apparatus is preferably and particularly<br>
used for exactly position-defined clamping of a work piece in the working area of<br>
a machine tool (not shown). Thereby, as it is the case in the present example,<br>
the work piece carrier 40 can simultaneously be the work piece itself. The bottom<br>
of the upper portion of the clamping chuck facing an actuating piston 10<br>
preferably extends radially downwards from the centre.<br>
The clamping chuck 1, to be fixed to the machine tool by<br>
means known per se and not shown in the drawings, comprises a central<br>
opening 2 adapted to receive and fix the clamping pin 30 of the work<br>
piece carrier 40. The upper area of this opening 2 is designed as a conical<br>
inserting portion 3. The top surface of the clamping chuck 1 is provided with two<br>
annular surface portions 5, 6 located in concentric relationship to the central<br>
opening 2. The annular surface portions 5, 6 serve as Z-references for the work<br>
piece carrier 40, i.e. they define the height position of the work<br>
piece carrier 40 once the lower surface of the latter one rests on<br>
the surface portions 5, 6. As can be seen from Fig. 1, the inner<br>
annular surface portion 5 surrounds the opening 2 in a relatively<br>
small distance. The work piece carrier 40 comprises a flat lower<br>
surface 41 which constitutes a reference surface resting on the<br>
surface portions 5, 6 and, thereby, defining the height position,<br>
i.e. the Z-position of the work piece carrier 40 relative to the<br>
clamping chuck 1. The clamping chuck 1 is provided with a connec-<br>
tor 4 for supplying a hydraulic or pneumatic medium to the inte-<br>
rior of the clamping chuck 1 to lock and release, respectively,<br>
the clamping pin 30 of the work piece carrier 40, as will be ex-<br>
plained herein below in more detail.<br>
Fig. 2 shows a longitudinal sectional view of the clamping<br>
chuck 1 and the work piece carrier 40. The clamping chuck 1 com-<br>
prises a cup-shaped lower portion 8, an upper portion 9 connected<br>
to the lower portion 8 by means of screws 7, and a piston 10 sup-<br>
ported by means of (not shown) biased springs on the upper portion<br>
9. The upper portion 9 is provided with a hollow cylindrical<br>
sleeve 12 projecting downwards from the upper portion 9. The inner<br>
wall of the sleeve 12 defines the opening 2 constituted by a cen-<br>
tral continuous cylindrical bore. The sleeve 12 and the upper por-<br>
tion 9 are designed as a one piece construction, whereby the<br>
sleeve 12 extends downwards into a circular recess 13 machined<br>
into the lower portion 8 of the clamping chuck 1.<br>
The upper end of the clamping pin 30 attached to the work<br>
piece carrier 40 is provided with a cylindrical reference surface<br>
portion 38 as well as with an annular reference surface portion<br>
37. The annular reference surface portion 37 of the clamping pin<br>
30 rests against the flat lower surface 41 of the work piece car-<br>
rier; thus, the lower surface 41 of the work piece carrier, serv-<br>
ing as a Z-reference, takes a well defined position with regard to<br>
the clamping pin 30.<br>
A clamping mechanism 20 for clamping the clamping pin 30 com-<br>
prises, besides the already mentioned piston 10 and the coil<br>
springs (not shown), a plurality of clamping balls 15. The clamp-<br>
ing balls 15 are received in radially extending bores 14 provided<br>
in the wall of the sleeve 12. In order to enable the piston 10 to<br>
be moved, against the bias force of the (not shown) springs, into<br>
the here shown upper end position, a pressure chamber 17 is pro-<br>
vided between the lower portion 8 of the clamping chuck 1 and the<br>
piston 10. The pressure chamber 17 can be hydraulically or pneu-<br>
matically pressurized. For clarity's sake, the gaskets required to<br>
seal the pressure chamber 17 have been omitted from the drawings.<br>
The clamping pin 30, attached to the work piece carrier 40 by<br>
means of a screw 31, comprises a truncated cone shaped portion 32<br>
located at the front end of the clamping pin 30. The back side of<br>
the truncated cone shaped portion 32 forms a circumferential<br>
shoulder 33 on which the clamping balls 15 for pulling in and fix-<br>
ing the clamping pin 30 can rest. Preferably, the front edge 36 of<br>
the clamping pin 30 is rounded. In the region of its rear end, the<br>
clamping pin 30 comprises a further, truncated cone shaped portion<br>
35. The amount of taper of both the front portion 32 and the rear<br>
portion 35 are adjusted to the amount of taper of the conical in-<br>
serting portion 3 of the central opening 2. However, the front<br>
portion 32 is designed such that its minimal outer diameter is<br>
appr. 5 to 10 mm less than the greatest diameter of the conical<br>
inserting portion 3 of the central opening 2 of the clamping chuck<br>
1. In any case, the maximal diameter of the front portion 32 of<br>
the clamping pin 30 is greater than the minimal diameter of the<br>
rear portion 35 of the clamping pin 30. The result is that the<br>
front portion 32 of the clamping pin 30 provides for a course cen-<br>
tering of the clamping pin 30 in the central opening 2, while the<br>
rear portion 35 provides for a fine centering to exactly position-<br>
ally adjust the clamping pin 30 both in X- and in Y-directions.<br>
In order to enable the clamping balls 15 to be radially moved inwards into<br>
their operating position, the piston 10 is provided with an inclined pressure<br>
surface 18. This pressure surface 18 is designed such that the clamping balls 15<br>
are self-lockingly held in their operating position once the piston 10 is in its<br>
locking position. Below the above mentioned pressure surface 18, the piston 10<br>
is provided with an annular groove 19 into which the locking balls 15 can retract<br>
when the piston 10 is in its release position shown in Figs. 2 and 3. It is<br>
understood that the clamping pin 20 can be readily inserted into and removed<br>
from the central opening 2 of the clamping chuck 1 once the piston 10 is in its<br>
release position shown here.<br>
The upper portion 9 of the clamping chuck 1 comprises an inclined lower<br>
surface 21 and the piston comprises a correspondingly inclined upper portion 22.<br>
Together with the sleeve 12 extending up to the lower portion 8 of the clamping<br>
chuck 1, such a design results in a very rigid assembly by means of which very<br>
high pulling forces can be realized without any noticeable deformation of the<br>
upper portion 9 of the clamping chuck 1. Moreover, the one piece design of<br>
sleeve 12 and upper portion 9 of the clamping chuck 1 ensures that when very<br>
high pulling forces act on the work piece carrier 40 clamped to the clamping<br>
chuck 1, there is no danger of the work piece carrier 40 moving in axial direction,<br>
because it is not resilient in Z-direction, in contrast to clamping systems using a<br>
separate clamping ball cage. Furthermore, thanks to the continuous, one-piece<br>
design of the sleeve 12, the sealing of the pressure chamber 17 is simplified.<br>
Before the clamping pin 30 can be inserted into the central opening 2 of<br>
the clamping chuck 1, it has to be coarsely aligned to the opening 2. Thereafter,<br>
the work piece carrier can be lowered downwards onto the clamping chuck 1.<br>
Upon insertion, first, the clamping pin 30 is coarsely centered due to the fact that<br>
its front portion 32 engages the wall portion 3a of the conical inserting portion 3<br>
of the central opening 2. Since the amount of taper of the front portion 32 is<br>
equal to the amount of taper of the inserting portion 3 of the central opening 2,<br>
and since the work piece carrier 40 is held in a horizontal position during<br>
insertion of the clamping pin 30 into the central opening 2, a line contact results<br>
between the front portion 32 of the clamping pin 30 and the wall 3a of the<br>
inserting portion 3 of the central opening 2. In the case of a line contact, the<br>
danger of damage to the clamping pin 30 and to the central opening 2,<br>
respectively, is much lower than in the case of a point contact.<br>
Upon continued insertion of the clamping pin 30 into the central bore 2 of.<br>
the clamping chuck 1, a fine centering of the clamping pin 30 in X- and Y-<br>
directions is accomplished under the influence of the rear truncated cone shaped<br>
portion 35 of the clamping pin 1. Thereby, the rear portion 35 of the clamping pin<br>
30 rests completely on the wall 3a of the conical inserting portion of the central<br>
opening 2. The dimensioning of the clamping is so chosen that a gap S with a<br>
width of between 0.01 to 0.02 mm exists between the annular surface portions 5,<br>
6, serving as a Z-reference, and the flat bottom surface 41 of the work piece<br>
carrier 40 after fine centering, but before clamping the work piece carrier 40 to<br>
the clamping chuck 1, i.e. when the work piece carrier 40 rests only with its<br>
mass on the clamping chuck 1, as shown in Fig. 3. It is to be understood that the<br>
gap S shown in Fig. 3 is greatly exaggerated for the sake of clarity.<br>
Referring to the clamping pin 30, this means that the reference surface<br>
portion 37 of the clamping pin 30, serving as a Z-reference of the clamping pin<br>
30, towers above the annular surface portions 5, 6 by the above mentioned<br>
amount of between 0.01 and 0.02 mm, when the clamping pin 30 is loosely<br>
inserted, i.e. without any pulling force, into the central opening 2 of the clamping<br>
chuck 1. Depending on the design, the size and the dimensioning of the<br>
clamping apparatus, the above mentioned gap S can vary within wider limits, e.g.<br>
between 0.005 mm and 0.1 mm. It is to be understood that the lower surface of<br>
the work piece carrier 40 does not compellingly have to be flat, but that it can<br>
comprise different surfaces and/or planes. Important is only, the clamping<br>
apparatus still being in its released state, that a gap within the above mentioned<br>
limits exists between the coaxial surface portions 5, 6, serving as Z-stop<br>
members of the clamping chuck 1, and the surface areas of the work piece<br>
carrier 40 that are intended to rest on these surface portions 5, 6, such that the<br>
clamping pin 30 can align in X- and Y-directions without clearance to the<br>
inserting portion 3 of the central opening 2. Further, it is to be understood that<br>
the reference surface portion 37 of the clamping pin 30, constituting the Z-<br>
reference thereof, is not necessary to coincide with the bottom surface 41 of the<br>
work piece carrier 40, but it can, if appropriate, be recessed or protrude<br>
therefrom, depending on the design of the clamping pin 30 and/or the work piece<br>
carrier 40 and its bottom surface, respectively.<br>
Fig. 4 shows a longitudinal sectional view of the clamping chuck 1 with the<br>
work piece carrier 40 clamped onto it. In order to clamp the loosely inserted work<br>
piece carrier 40 to the clamping chuck 1, the pressure in the pressure chamber<br>
17 is reduced, with the result that the piston 10 is pushed down into the position<br>
shown in Fig. 4 under the influence of coil springs 23, 25, as will be described in<br>
more detail herein after. Thereby, the clamping balls 15 are radially moved<br>
inwards, as is known in the art, where they rest on the shoulder 33 of the<br>
clamping pin 30, thereby puling the latter one downwards. When a high pulling<br>
force of up to 20 KN is exerted, the length of the clamping pin 30 is slightly<br>
increased, with a simultaneous decrease of its diameter, and the conical shaped<br>
inserting portion 3 of the central opening 2 is slightly widened.<br>
The result is that the clamping pin 30 is pulled into the central opening 2<br>
somewhat deeper, with the work piece carrier 40 moving downwards in Z-<br>
direction until its flat bottom surface 41 rests on the surface portions 5, 6 of the<br>
clamping chuck 1, serving as Z-stops. Thus, the work piece carrier 40 is<br>
positioned not only in X- and Y- directions, but also in Z-direction. In other words:<br>
The alignment of the work piece carrier 40 with regard to the clamping chuck 1 in<br>
X- and Y- directions is accomplished without any clamping force acting on these<br>
two elements, while the movement of the work piece carrier 40 in Z-direction is<br>
accomplished exclusively by making use of the elasticity of the material of the<br>
clamping pin 30 and of the clamping chuck 1 in the region of its inserting portion<br>
3 of the central opening 2.<br>
The elements of the clamping apparatus essential for the operation<br>
thereof are adjusted to each other, as far as dimensions and shape is<br>
concerned, in such a way that the reduction of the width of the gap S between<br>
the flat bottom surface 41 of the work piece carrier 40 and the surface portions 5,<br>
6 of the clamping chuck 1 to zero, after the fine positioning of the clamping pin<br>
30, and, therewith, the work piece carrier 40 in X- and Y-directions, is realized<br>
essentially exclusively with the help of the elasticity of the material of the<br>
clamping pin 30 as well as of the clamping chuck 1 in the region of the central<br>
opening 2. Thus, and in contrast to clamping apparatuses of the prior art, no<br>
members or elements that are elastically resilient in Z-direction have to be<br>
provided.<br>
From Fig. 4, showing a longitudinal sectional view of the clamping chuck 1<br>
together with the work piece carrier 40 clamped thereto, particularly also the coil<br>
springs 23, 25 are evident, these springs being provided for biasing the piston 10<br>
and responsible for the pulling force exerted on the clamping pin 30. For<br>
clarifying the design of the clamping chuck I, the left side of the drawing shows a<br>
sectional view taken through the coil springs of the clamping chuck I, while the<br>
right side shows a sectional view taken between adjacent coil springs of the<br>
clamping chuck 1.<br>
Depending on the required pulling force, both the number of<br>
coil springs and their spring force can be selected. For realizing<br>
very high pulling forces, twin springs can be provided as can be<br>
seen in the left side of Fig. 4, where two coil springs 23, 24 are<br>
arranged coaxially one in the other one. For compensating of<br>
torque forces that may be exerted to the upper portion 9 of the<br>
clamping chuck 1, the winding sense of diametrically opposite coil<br>
springs 23, 25 is different. Preferably, the clamping chuck 1 is<br>
provided with a plurality of coil springs evenly distributed along<br>
a circular path; for example, to reach high pulling forces, prac-<br>
tice has shown that a total of 16 coil springs should be used,<br>
i.e. 8 outer coil springs 23 and 8 inner coil springs 24.<br>
Moreover, the right side illustration in Fig. 4 shows that<br>
the clamping mechanism can take high pulling forces due to the one<br>
piece design of the sleeve 12 and the upper portion 9 of the<br>
clamping chuck 1, and due to the clamping balls 15 being received<br>
in the sleeve 12 essentially without clearance.<br>
In order to remove the work piece carrier 4 0 from the clamp-<br>
ing chuck 1, the piston 10 is pneumatically cr hydraulically moved<br>
upwards, against the force of the coil springs. Thereby, the<br>
clamping balls 15 are released with the result that they can move<br>
back into the groove 19, freeing the clamping pin 30 which now can<br>
be pulled upwards out of the central opening 2 of the clamping<br>
chuck 1. The clamping mechanism having been released, both the<br>
clamping pin 30 and the upper portion of the central opening 2 of<br>
the clamping chuck 1 revert to their original dimensions due to<br>
their elastic behavior.<br>
Figures 5 to 7 show three different embodiments of clamping<br>
pins 30, 30a and 30c, respectively, which are suitable to be used<br>
in combination with a large pallet comprising several clamping<br>
pins. The uppermost clamping pin 30 shown in Fig. 5 corresponds to<br>
the embodiment discussed already herein before; it comprises a<br>
surface portion 35 in the shape of a truncated cone for centering<br>
in X- and Y-directions and located at the rear end of the clamping<br>
pin 30. The clamping pin 30a shown in Fig. 6 comprises at its rear<br>
end, instead of a truncated cone shaped portion, two diametrically<br>
opposite surface portions 35a in the shape of a segment of a trun-<br>
cated cone. It is understood that only the frontal surface portion<br>
35a can be seen in Fig. 6, while the rear one is hidden in this<br>
view. However, in Fig. 6a showing the clamping pin 30a in a side<br>
elevational view, both surface portions 35a are visible. By means<br>
of these surface portions 35a, the clamping pin 30a can be cen-<br>
tered by means of the conical inserting portion 3 of the central<br>
opening 2 (Fig. 1) in one direction only, preferably in X-<br>
direction or in Y-direction. In order to enable the clamping pin<br>
30a and its surface portions 35a, respectively, to be properly<br>
aligned upon attaching it to the work piece carrier 40, the clamp-<br>
ing pin 30a is provided with two diametrically opposite flattened<br>
portions 39, adapted to be engaged by a wrench or similar tool.<br>
The lowermost clamping pin 30c according to Fig. 7 is provided at<br>
its rear end with a surface portion 35c having the shape of a<br>
truncated cone. However, that surface portion 35c has an outer di-<br>
ameter about 0.1 to 0.2 mm smaller than the outer diameter of the<br>
surface portion 35 of the clamping pin 30 according to Fig. 5.<br>
Thus, the clamping pin 30c acts as a simple clamping element with-<br>
out any centering and positioning function. The clamping apparatus<br>
being in its clamped state, i.e. if the flat bottom surface of the<br>
work piece carrier rests on the Z-reference surface portions of<br>
the clamping chuck, a gap in the region of 0.1 to 0.2 mm exists<br>
between the truncated cone shaped portion 35c of the clamping pin<br>
30c according to Fig. 7 and the conical inserting portion 3 of the<br>
central opening 2 of the clamping chuck 1 (Fig. 1).<br>
Instead of being provided with a truncated cone shaped por-<br>
tion 35, the clamping pin 30 according to Fig. 5 could be equipped<br>
with four surface portions 35a in the shape of a segment of a<br>
truncated cone, evenly distributed along the rear periphery of the<br>
clamping pin 30, for aligning it in X- and Y-directions.<br>
Fig. 8 shows a perspective view of a machining table 42<br>
equipped with four clamping chucks 1, la, lb and lc, as well as of<br>
a work piece carrier 43, called a pallet in the following,<br>
equipped with four clamping pins 30, 30a, 30b and 30c. Out of the<br>
four clamping pins 30, 30a, 30b and 30c, the frontmost clamping<br>
pin 30 corresponds to the one shown in Fig. 5, provided with a<br>
truncated cone shaped portion 35 for centering the pin 30 in X-<br>
and Y-directions. This clamping pin 30 sets the origin once the<br>
pallet 43 having been clamped to the machining table 42. The two<br>
lateral clamping pins 30a and 30b are designed according to the<br>
embodiment shown in Fig. 6, each comprising two diametrically op-<br>
posite surface portions 35a and 35b, respectively, in the shape of<br>
a segment of a truncated cone, whereby again only the frontal sur-<br>
face portions 35a and 35b, respectively, are visible. The rearmost<br>
clamping pin 30c, finally, corresponds to the embodiment according<br>
to Fig. 7 and acts only as a clamping member without any centering<br>
or positioning functions for clamping the pallet 43 to the machin-<br>
ing table 42.<br>
Fig. 8a shows an enlarged view of the right clamping pin 30a,<br>
and Fig. 8b shows an enlarged view of the left clamping pin 30b.<br>
These two clamping pins serve for determining the angular position<br>
of the pallet 43 around the origin defined by the clamping pin 30.<br>
Thereby, the surface portions 35a of the right clamping pin 30a<br>
align the pallet 43 in Y-direction, while the surface portions 35b<br>
of the left clamping pin 30b align the pallet 43 in X-direction.<br>
As mentioned before, the rearmost; clamping pin 30c serves only for<br>
clamping the pallet 43 in Z-direction.<br>
Even if two clamping pins 30a, 30b are provided in this em-<br>
bodiment for determining the angular position of the pallet 43<br>
around the origin, it could be sufficient to provide only one<br>
clamping pin for this purpose. However, the design and arrangement<br>
of the clamping pins shown in Fig. 8 and discussed herein before<br>
has the advantage that no geometric over-determination of the po-<br>
sition of the pallet upon clamping occurs, because thermal dimen-<br>
sion changes of the pallet are compensated for by the correspond-<br>
ing clamping pins. Tests carried out on this subject have shown<br>
that the surface portions 35a of a clamping pin 30a designed ac-<br>
cording to the embodiment of Fig. 6 can equalize thermally caused<br>
expansions or dimensional deviations of the pallet 43 up to as<br>
much as 0.1 to 0.2 mm.<br>
Besides the clamping chucks 1 discussed herein before which<br>
per se do not comprise any means for determining the angular posi-<br>
tion around the Z-axis of the work piece carrier, other clamping<br>
chucks could be provided which do comprise means for determining<br>
not only the position in X- and Y-directions, but also the angular<br>
position around the Z-axis, with the result that, if appropriate,<br>
a work piece carrier having only one clamping pin can be clamped<br>
"to the clamping chuck both in a desired linear and angular posi-<br>
tions. It is understood that, in such a case, the work piece car-<br>
rier would be provided with suitable positioning means, whereby<br>
the clamping pin serves only for a coarse positioning of the work<br>
piece carrier, but not for a fine positioning. Then, the clamping<br>
pin would have the design as shown in Fig. 7 and discussed in con-<br>
nection therewith.<br>
