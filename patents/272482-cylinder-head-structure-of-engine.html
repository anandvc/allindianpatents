According to the invention called for in claim 1, the head cover fastening bosses are integrally formed on the upper portion of the cam shaft holder, and the upper ends of the head cover fastening bosses are arranged above the mating face which is formed on the upper portion of the cylinder head so as to be in contact with the lower portion of the head cover by way of the gasket. Due to such constitution, a length of the head cover fastening bolts can be shortened and hence, the cylinder head can be light-weighted and, at the same time, the assembling property of the cylinder head can be enhanced.  Further, spaces<br><br><br>
are formed below the head cover fastening bosses and hence, the cylinder head can be further light-weighted due to the reduction of wall thicknesses of the head cover fastening bosses from below. [0014]<br>
Further, according to the invention called for in claim 2, the upper portion of the cylinder head is constituted of the bottom portion on which the cam shaft holders are formed in a projecting manner and the side wall portion which projects upwardly from the outer periphery of the bottom portion thus forming a box shape which is opened upwardly, and the head cover fastening bosses are arranged at positions spaced-apart inward from the side wall portion which forms the mating face on the upper end thereof. Accordingly, the head cover fastening bosses do not become obstacles in forming the mating face thus easing the forming of the mating face. Further, although there exists a possibility that blow-holes are formed in an outer surface of the side wall portion at the time of casting the cylinder head when the side wall portion and the head cover fastening bosses are integrally and contiguously formed, the head cover fastening bosses are arranged at positions spaced-apart inward from the side wall portion and hence, the formation of the blow-holes can be surely prevented thus easing the maintenance of appearance of the cylinder head. Further, due to the structure which prevents the direct connection of<br><br><br>
the head cover fastening bosses with the side wall portion and the bottom portion, a recessed portion in which lubrication oil stays is hardly formed on the upper portion of the cylinder head thus improving the return of lubrication oil from the cylinder head. [0015]<br>
According to the invention called for in claim 3, the cylinder block and the cylinder head are joined together to the crankcase using the plurality of stud bolts and the plurality of nuts, and on the upper ends of the stud bolt insertion bosses which are integrally formed with the cylinder head such that the stud bolts are respectively inserted into the stud bolt insertion bosses, nut engaging surfaces which are arranged on the same plane as upper ends of the head cover fastening bosses are formed. Due to such constitution, forming of the upper ends of the head cover fastening bosses and forming of the nut engaging surfaces can be easily performed. [0016]<br>
According to the invention called for in claim 4 , four stud bolt insertion bosses which respectively allow the insertion of four stud bolts therethrough are integrally formed on four corners of camshaft holders. Accordingly, it is possible to make the respective stud bolt insertion bosses function as strength-and-rigidity portions of the cam shaft<br><br>
holders and, further, two head cover fastening bosses are respectively individually and integrally formed on two stud bolt insertion bosses arranged at diagonal positions. Due to such constitution, by contiguously forming the head cover fastening bosses on the stud bolt insertion bosses having high strength and rigidity, it is possible to increase the strength and the rigidity of the head cover fastening bosses . Further, the stud bolt insertion bosses and the head cover fastening bosses are arranged close to each other and hence, a moving distance of a tool for machining upper end surfaces of the stud bolt insertion bosses and the head cover fastening bosses can be decreased thus contributing to shortening of forming time. Further, by contiguously forming the head cover fastening bosses on the stud bolt insertion bosses which are arranged at diagonal positions at four corners of the cam shaft holders, a distance between the two head cover fastening bosses can be set to a large value and hence, the head cover can be fixed to the cylinder head in a stable manner. [0017]<br>
According to the invention called for in claim 5, the annular oil passage is formed between the stud bolt which is inserted into the specific stud bolt insertion boss different from the stud bolt insertion bosses on which the head cover fastening bosses are integrally and contiguously formed and the cylinder head, and the branch passage which is branched<br><br><br>
from the midst portion of the annular oil passage is formed in the cylinder head. Due to such constitution, the head cover fastening bosses and the branch passage can be arranged in a spaced-apart manner from each other thus preventing large-sizing of the cylinder head. [0018]<br>
According to the invention called for in claim 6, the threaded holes with which the head cover fastening bolts are engaged are formed in the head cover fastening bosses in a state that the threaded holes vertically penetrates the head cover fastening bosses. Due to such constitution, lower-hole forming and threads forming of the threaded holes can be easily performed and, at the same time, the cut debris can be also easily removed. Further, heights of the head cover fastening bosses pan be set corresponding to the required threaded hole distance and hence, the head cover fastening bosses can be miniaturized thus enhancing the reduction of weight more effectively. [0019]<br>
According to the invention called for in claim 7, the lower opening ends of the threaded holes are arranged above the mating face of the cylinder head and hence, the lower opening ends of the threaded holes can be easily observed and a tool can be easily inserted into the lower opening end side of the threaded holes thus easing a burr removing operation.<br><br><br>
[0020]<br>
According to the invention called for in claim 8, the lower ends of the head cover fastening bosses are arranged above the mating face of the cylinder head and hence, the reduction of weight of the head cover fastening bosses can be further enhanced.<br>

Here, a lower portion of the head cover 40 is brought into contact with the mating face 61 which is formed on the upper end of the side wall .portion 39b of the cylinder head 39 by way of the gasket 62 . In such constitution , by threadedly engaging two head cover fastening bolts 95, 95 which are inserted into the head cover 40 with two head cover fastening bosses 96, 97 which are integrally formed with the cylinder head 39, the head cover 40 is joined to the cylinder head 39. [0046]<br><br><br>
The head cover fastening bosses 96, 97 are integrally formed on upper portions of the camshaft holders 68, 69 which are integrally formed with the cylinder head 39 so as to rotatably support the camshaft 63 which constitutes a portion of the valve operating mechanism 57. Here, upper ends of the head cover fastening bosses 96,97 are arranged above the mating face 61. These head cover fastening bosses 96, 97 are integrally formed on upper portions of the camshaft holders 68, 6 9 such that spaces are formed below the head cover fastening bosses 96, 97 and the head cover fastening bosses 96, 97 project sideward from the camshaft holders 68, 69. Further, the spaces below the head cover fastening bosses 96, 9 7 can be formed using a sand core at the time of forming the cylinder head 39 by casting. [0047]<br>
Here, the cylinder block 38 and the cylinder head 39 are joined together to the crankcase 37 using a plurality of, for example, four stud bolts 98, 99. 100, 101 which are mounted on the crankcase 37 and a plurality of, for example, four nuts 102... with which these stud bolts 98 to 101 are threadedly engaged; Four stud bolt insertion bosses 103, 104, 105, 106 which allow the insertion of the respective stud bolts 98 to 101 therethrough are integrally formed on the cylinder head 39. [0048]<br><br><br>
Four stud bolt insertion bosses 103 to 106 which respectively allow the insertion of the respective stud bolts 98 to 101 therethrough are integrally formed on four corners of both camshaft holders 68, 69. On two stud bolt insertion bosses 103, 105 which are arranged at diagonal positions out of these stud bolt insertion bosses 103 to 106, two head cover fastening bosses 96, 97 are respectively, individually, integrally and contiguously formed. Further, the head cover fastening bosses 96 , 97 are arranged at a position spaced apart inward from the side wall portion 39b of the upper portion of the cylinder head 39. [0049]<br>
On upper ends of the stud bolt insertion bosses 103 to 106, nut engaging surfaces 103a, 104a, 105a, 106a which are arranged on the same plane as upper ends of the head cover fastening bosses 96, 97 are formed. The nuts 102... which are threadedly engaged with the stud bolts 98 to 101 are brought into contact with or engaged with the nut engaging surfaces 103a to 106a by way of washers 107.... [0050]<br>
The head cover fastening bolts 95... are inserted into the head cover 4 0 with annular sealing members 10 8... interposed between the head cover fastening bolts 95... and the head cover 40 . The head cover fastening bolts 95... include flange portions 95a... which are brought into contact with upper ends of the head<br><br><br>
cover fastening bosses 96, 97, and screw shaft portions 95b... which project from the flange portions 95a coaxially. The screw shaft portions 9 5... are threadedly engaged with threaded holes 109, 110 which are formed in the head cover fastening bosses 96, 97. [0051]<br>
Here, lower ends of the head cover fastening bosses 96, 97 are arranged above the mating face 61 of the cylinder head 39, and the threaded holes 109, 110 vertically penetrate the head cover fastening bosses 96 , 97 such that the threaded holes 109, 110 have lower opening ends thereof arranged above the mating face 61 of the cylinder head 39. [0052]<br>
As shown in Fig. 2 , Fig. 3 , Fig. 8 and Fig . 9 , an oil passage 111 which extends in the direction orthogonal to the axis of the camshaft 63 is formed in the head cover 40. As shown in Fig. 2 and Fig. 8, two oil jets 112, 113 which are communicated with the oil passage 111 are formed in the head cover 40 such that these oil jets 112 , 113 blow off oil to the valve operating mechanism 57 side. [0053]<br>
Here, between the stud bolt 99 which is inserted into at least one specific stud bolt insertion boss out of two stud bolt insertion bosses excluding the stud bolt insertion bosses 103, 105 which are integrally and contiguously formed with the<br><br><br>
head cover fastening bosses 96, 97 out of four stud bolt insertion bosses 103 to 106 (in this embodiment, one specific stud bolt insertion boss 104) and the cylinder head 39, as shown in Fig. 5, an annular oil passage 114 is formed. Also between the stud bolt 9 9 and the cylinder block 3 8, an annular oil passage 115 which is communicated with the annular oil passage 114 is formed, and the annular oil passage 115 is connected with an oil supply source not shown in the drawing through an oil passage 116 formed in the crankcase 37. [0054]<br>
A branch passage 117 which is branched from a midst portion of the annular oil passage 114 is formed in the cylinder head 39 and extends in an oblique upward direction so as to guide oil to the oil passage 111 side of the head cover side 40. A lower end of a communication passage 118 which is communicated with the oil passage 111 and extends downward and an upper end of the branch passage 117 are connected with each other by way of a sleeve 119 sandwiched between the cylinder head 39 and a head cover 40. [0055] ;<br>
Next, the manner of operation of this embodiment is explained. On the upper portions of the cam shaft holders 68, 69 which are integrally formed on the cylinder head 39 so as to rotatably support the camshaft 63 which constitutes a portion of the valve operating mechanism 57, the head cover<br><br><br>
fastening bosses 96, 97 whose upper ends are arranged above the mating face 61 of the upper end of the cylinder head 39 are integrally formed such that.the head cover fastening bosses 96, 97 project sideward from the cam shaft holders 68, 69. Accordingly, a length of the head cover fastening bolts 95... can be shortened and hence, the cylinder head 39 can be light-weighted and, at the same time, the assembling property of the cylinder head 39 can be enhanced. Further, the spaces are formed below the head cover fastening bosses 96, 97 and hence, the cylinder head 39 can be light-weighted due to the reduction of wall thicknesses of the head cover fastening bosses 96 , 97 from below. Still further, by forming the spaces using the sand cores at the time of forming the cylinder head 3 9 by casting, the increase of the number of cores becomes unnecessary and hence, it is possible to form the spaces below the head cover fastening bosses 96, 97 while suppressing the increase of a cost. [0056}<br>
Further, the upper portion of the cylinder head 39 is constituted of the bottom portion 39a on which the head cover fastening bosses 96, 97 are formed in a projecting manner and the side wall portion 39b which projects upwardly from the outer periphery of the bottom portion 39a thus forming a box shape which is opened upward, and the head cover fastening bosses 96, 97 are arranged at positions spaced-apart inward from the<br><br><br>
side wail portion 39b which forms the mating face 61 on the upper end thereof. Accordingly, the head cover fastening bosses 96, 97 do not become obstacles in forming the mating face 61 thus easing the forming of the mating face 61. Further, although there exists a possibility that blow-holes are formed in an outer surface of the side wall portion 39b at the time of casting the cylinder head 39 when the side wall portion 39b and the head cover fastening bosses 96, 97 are integrally and contiguously formed, the head cover fastening bosses 96, 97 are arranged at positions spaced-apart inward from the side wall portion 39b and hence, the formation of the blow-holes can be surely prevented thus easing the maintenance of appearance of the cylinder head 3 9. Further, due to the structure which prevents the direct connection of the head cover fastening bosses 96, 97 with the side wall portion 39b and the bottom portion 39a, a recessed portion in which lubrication oil stays is hardly formed in the upper portion of the cylinder head 39 thus improving the return of lubrication oil from the cylinder head 39. [0057]<br>
Further, the cylinder block 38 and the cylinder head 39 are joined together to the crankcase 3 7 using the plurality of, for example, four stud bolts 98, 99, 100, 101 and the plurality of nuts 102..., and on the upper ends of the stud bolt insertion bosses 103, 104, 105, 106 which are integrally formed<br><br><br>
with the cylinder head 39 such that the stud bolts 98 to 101 are respectively inserted into the stud bolt insertion bosses 103, 104, 105, 106, nut engaging surfaces 103a, 104a, 105a, 106a which are arranged on the same plane as upper ends of the head cover fastening bosses 96, 97 are formed. Accordingly, forming of the upper ends of the head cover fastening bosses 96, 97 and forming of the nut engaging surfaces 103a to lQ6a can be easily performed. [0058]<br>
Further, four stud bolt insertion bosses 103 to 106 which respectively allow the insertion of the respective four stud bolts 98 to 101 therethrough are integrally formed on four corners of both camshaft holder 68, 69. Accordingly, it is possible to make the stud bolt insertion bosses 103 to 106 functioh as strength-and-rigidity portions of the cam shaft holders 68, 69. Two head cover fastening bosses 96, 97 are respectively individually and integrally formed on two stud bolt insertion bosses 103, 105 arranged at two diagonal positions and hence, by contiguously forming the head cover fastening bosses 9.6, 97 on the stud bolt insertion bosses 103, 105 having high strength and rigidity, it is possible to increase the strength and the rigidity of the head cover fastening bosses 96, 97. Further, the stud bolt insertion bosses l03, 105 and the head cover fastening bosses 96, 97 can be arranged close to each other and hence, a moving distance<br><br><br>
of a tool for machining upper end surfaces of the stud bolt insertion bosses 103, 105 and the head cover fastening bosses 96, 97 can be decreased thus contributing to shortening of forming time. [0059]<br>
Further, by contiguously forming the head cover fastening bosses 96, 97 on the stud bolt insertion bosses 103, 105 which are arranged at diagonal positions at four corners of the cam shaft holders 68, 69, a distance between two head cover fastening bosses 96, 97 can be set to a large value and hence, the head cover 40 can be fixed to the cylinder head 39 in a stable manner. [0060]<br>
Further, the annular oil passage 114 is formed between the stud bolt 99 which is inserted into the specific stud bolt insertion boss 104 different from the stud bolt insertion bosses 103, 105 on which the head cover fastening bosses 96, 97 are integrally and contiguously formed and the cylinder head 39 , and the branch passage 117 which is branched from the midst portion of the annular oil passage 114 and is communicated with the oil passage 111 formed in the head cover 40 is formed in the cylinder head 39 . Due to such constitution, the head cover fastening bosses 96, 97 and the branch passage 117 can be arranged in a spaced-apart manner from each other thus preventing large-sizing of the cylinder head 3 9.<br><br><br>
[0061] :<br>
Further, the lower ends of the head cover fastening bosses 96, 97 are arranged above the mating face 61 of the cylinder head 39 and hence, the reduction of weight of the head cover fastening bosses 96, 97 can be enhanced. [0062]<br>
Further, the threaded holes 109, 110 with which the head cover fastening bolts 9 5... are threadedly engaged are formed in the head cover fastening bosses 96, 97 in a state that the threaded holes 109, 110 vertically penetrates the head cover fastening bosses 96, 97. Accordingly, lower-hole forming and threads forming of the threaded holes 109, 110 can be easily performed and, at the same time, the cut debris can be also easily removed. Further, heights of the head cover fastening bosses 96, 97 can be set corresponding to the required threaded hole distance and hence, the head cover fastening bosses 96, 97 can be miniaturized thus enhancing the reduction of weight more effectively. [0063] 1<br>
Further, the lower opening ends of the threaded holes 109, 110 are arranged above the mating face 61 of the cylinder head 39 and hence, the lower opening ends of the threaded holes 109 , 110 can be easily observed and a tool can be easily inserted into the lower opening end side of the threaded holes 109, 110 thus easing a burr removing operation.<br><br><br>
