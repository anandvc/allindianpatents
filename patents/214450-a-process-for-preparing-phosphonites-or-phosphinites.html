				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The invention relates to a process for preparing phosphonites or phosphinites, in particular aromatic phosphonites or phosphinites, having significantly improved properties for stabilizing polymer materials. Products made by this process of the invention are distinguished by higher activity, improved hydrolysis stability and clear solubility as well as a markedly decreased content of unwanted byproducts.<br>
As known to those skilled in the art, aromatic phosphonites or phosphinites may be prepared by Friedel-Crafts reaction (reaction 1) of aromatics with halogen-containing phosphorous compounds such as phosphorus trichloride, phosphorus tribromide resp. alkyl- or aryldihalophosphines. The aluminium halide adducts initially formed are cleaved by recomplexing with tertiary amines or phosphoryl chloride by methods known from the literature (reaction la). In a subsequent reaction (reaction 2) of the resultant aryldihalophosphines, alkylarylhalophosphines or" diarylhalophosphines with alcohols or phenols in the presence or absence of inert solvents and/or acid-binding agents such as tertiary amines, for example, the desired phosphonites or phosphinites are obtained. In this case "halogen" is chloride or bromide, but preferably chloride. These reaction paths have long been known and are described in the literature (e.g. Michaelis, Ann., 293, 193 (1896); Kosoiapoff, G.M., Organic Phosphorus Compounds, John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York, 1972). The reaction diagrams below also explicitly include a multiplicity of reactions of types 1 and 2 on one aromatic substrate, e.g. the Friedel-Crafts reaction of diphenyl with 2 equivalents of phosphorus trichloride. The individual reaction partners can be used in this case in a deficiency, stoichiometrically or in excess amounts. Reactions of this type are described, for example, in GB Patent 1372528.<br><br><br><br>
where independently of one another, each group<br>
R      is an aliphatic, cycloaliphatic or aromatic organic radical having 1-36 carbon atoms,    |<br>
which can also contain hetero atoms (N, O, P, S)	j<br>
R"      is Hal or R:	|<br>
R"     is an aliphatic, cycloaliphatic or aromatic organic radical having 1-36 carbon atoms,<br>
which can also contain hetero atoms (N, O, P, S);	|<br>
R""    is an aliphatic, cycloaliphatic or aromatic organic radical having 1-36 carbon atoms,<br>
which can also contain hetero atoms (N, O, P, S), or N(R"")3 as such is pyridine or    {<br>
alkyl-substituted pyridine;	i<br>
Hal    is CI or Br	j<br>
n       is 0-5<br>
m      is equal to 1 if R"=R and m is equal to 2 if R"=Hal.<br>
The said reaction mixtures may, under some circumstances, also further comprise organic or organophosphorus compounds such as phenols, alcohols, amines or phosphites, phosphonates, phosphates etc. which are likewise formed during the phosphonite/phosphinite synthesis, remain in the mixture as excess at the end of the reaction or else are deliberately added.<br><br><br>
The   reaction   of   Friedel-Cr	acohols   or   phenols   to   form<br>
phosphonites or phosphinites takes place either without solvent, in the presence of an inert non-polar solvent (such as aliphatics, cycloaliphatics or mixtures thereof), or alternatively without, with stoichiometric or superstoichiometric amounts of an acid acceptor (see reaction 2a).<br>
Common to all these preparation processes is the fact that a certain proportion of unwanted ,.   byproducts is present, which byproducts result, for example, from the incomplete reaction of     the halophosphorus compounds or are due to residual small amounts of aluminium halide or<br>
Vi amine hydrohalide salts. According to the classical procedure, these must be removed by complex and cost-intensive purification processes, such as crystallization, distillation, filtration processes or membrane processes or ion exchange, if a pure product is to be obtained. If these byproduct salts remain in the product, its properties and the usability as polymer stabilizer may be impaired. Thus, the clear solubility, particularly in nonpolar solvents, or else the transparency of the polymers, is decreased, an increase in the corrosivity to metals, promoted by halide ions, can occur and unwanted decomposition processes, such as the hydrolysis of the compounds themselves or of hydrolysable polymers such as polyester or polycarbonate can also be promoted.<br>
The object of the invention is to decrease significantly the content of unwanted byproducts in a simple and cost-effective manner and at the same time to increase the amount of active substance.<br>
It has surprisingly been found that, after the preparation as described above of the reaction mixtures comprising phosphonites and/or phosphinites, the addition of a small amount of one or more protic compounds such as alcohols, ammonia, primary or secondary amines or water alone or, preferably, in combination with an oxide, hydroxide, (hydrogen)carbonate or (hydrogen)phosphate of a metal and subsequent simple separation of only a small amount of solids after a suitable reaction time leads to a significant decrease in the halide contents, an improvement in the dear solubility in nonpolar solvents, a decrease in the aluminium content and an improved action as stabilizer for polymer materials compared with a phosphonite/phosphinite according to the pnor art.<br>
Alternatively, a small amount of one or more nitrogen containing substances of the group consisting of carbonic acid amides, thiocarbonic acid amides, carbonic acid imides, thiocarbonic acid imides, lactames, thiolactames, carbonic acid hydrazides, urea, thiourea, symmetncally  and  asymmetrically  substituted  urea  and  thiourea  derivatives,   urethanes.<br><br>
Case 1998CH107<br>
uretimides as well as guanidine and its salts or melamine and derivatives thereof, including polymeric compounds of all named classes, or an oxide, hydroxide, (hydrogen)carbonate or (hydrogen)phosphate of a metal may be used alone or, preferably, in combination with a protic compound as defined above and leads to a similar result as described above.<br>
Furthermore, combinations of one or more protic compounds and/or of one or more nitrogen containing substances (all as defined above) with an oxide, hydroxide, (hydrogen)carbonate or (hydrogen)phosphate of a metal can be used to improve the properties of phosphonites/phosphinites as described above.<br>
The invention therefore relates to a process for preparing phosphonites or phosphinites of the general formula (I)<br><br>
where<br>
aryl   is a substituted or unsubstituted aryl or heteroaryl radical;<br>
R      is any organic radical having 1-36 carbon atoms, which can also contain hetero atoms;<br>
and A       is either R or OR,<br>
by reacting a product of a Friedel-Crafts reaction of the general formula (II)<br><br>
where<br>
aryl   has the meaning above;<br>
Hal    is halogen; and<br>
A"      is either Hal or R,<br>
with a compound of the general formula (III)<br><br><br>
Case 1998CH107<br>
where R has the meaning above, and separating off the byproducts formed, characterized in that an aftertreatment is carried out with a protic compound such as alcohols, ammonia, primary or secondary amines or water, or with an oxide, hydroxide, (hydrogen)carbonate or (hydrogen)phosphate of a metal, or with a nitrogen containing compound of the group consisting of carbonic acid amides, thiocarbonic acid amides, carbonic acid imides. thiocarbonic acid imides, lactames, thiolactames, carbonic acid hydrazides, urea, thiourea, symmetrically and asymmetrically substituted urea and thiourea derivatives, urethanes, uretimides as well as guanidine and its salts or melamine and derivatives thereof, including polymeric compounds of all named classes, or in any combination of one or more substances of the above mentioned compound classes, in the absence of solvent or in an inert, nonpolar solvent and the resultant byproducts are again separated off.<br>
The reaction with the agents of the invention takes place either in the absence of solvent or in inert, nonpolar solvents such as alkanes or aromatics (e.g. benzene, toluene, xylenes, pyridine) or their mixtures, but particularly preferably in alkanes (e.g. heptane, cyclohexane, isooctane, decalin), alkane mixtures (e.g. boiling-point fractions of petroleum ethers) or technical-grade alkane mixtures having only a low content of aromatics. The previously preferred use of chloroaromatics, such as chlorobenzene or dichlorobenzene, as solvent can be avoided by the process described.<br>
The described procedure gives considerable simplifications in the removal of the byproducts, since these, together with the auxiliary agents, are produced only in small amounts and in readily removable form.<br>
Preferably, agent mixtures of alcohols or water together with oxides, hydroxides or carbonates of alkali and alkaline earth metals and of zinc or with a nitrogen containing compound are used in the workup of phosphonites/phosphinites, in which case other compounds such as phosphites, phenols and amines can also be present.<br>
Particular preference is given to the use of mixtures of water and oxides or hydroxides of the! alkali and alkaline earth metals or a nitrogen containing compound, selected from the group of carbonic acid amides, imides, lactames, urea, thiourea, substituted urea, melamine and its derivatives as well as polymeric compounds of all these classes, in the workup of aromatic phosphonites/phosphinites, in which case other compounds such as phosphites, phenols and amines can also be present.<br><br>
Very particular preference is given to the use of mixtures of water and oxides of magnesium or calcium and also hydroxides of sodium, potassium, magnesium and calcium or carbonic acid amides, urea or melamine in the workup of aromatic phosphonites/phosphinites in the presence of compounds such as phosphites, phenols and amines.<br>
The amounts used are 0.1-50 mol% of the protic compound, with respect to the amount of phosphonite/phosphinite, and 0.1-50 mol% of the oxides, hydroxides, (hydrogen)carbonates or phosphates of a metal or of the nitrogen containing compound.<br>
Preferred amounts are 0.5-35 mol% of the protic compound, with respect to the amount of phosphonite/phosphinite, and 0.5-35 mol% of the oxides, hydroxides, (hydrogen)carbonates or phosphates of metals of main groups I, II and III of the Periodic Table of the Elements and of zinc or of the nitrogen containing compound.<br>
Particularly preferred amounts are 1-25 mol% of the protic compound, with respect to the amount of phosphonite/phosphinite, and 1-25 mol% of the oxides or hydroxides of metals of main groups I and II of the Periodic Table of the Elements or 5-30 mol% of the nitrogen containing compound.<br>
The invention is especially suitable for working up a reaction mixture based on the reaction product of 2,4-di-tert-butylphenol with the Friedel-Crafts reaction product of diphenyl and phosphorus trichloride (cf. in this context Chemical Abstracts Number [119345-01-6]; trade name Sandostab® P-EPQ®).<br>
A further possibility consists in the aftertreatment with a combination of a nitrogen containing | compound, a protic compound and an oxide, hydroxide, (hydrogen)carbonate or i (hydrogen)phosphate of a metal. Preferred compounds are those of alkali and earth alkali ; metals and zinc. The amounts of such combination to be used are 0.1-50 mol%, preferably 0.5-35 mol%, most preferably 1-25 mol% with respect to the amount of "• phosphonite/phosphinite.<br>
The phosphonites or phosphinites obtained by the process of the invention are distinguished by a significant lowering of the halide contents, an improvement in the clear solubility in nonpolar solvents, a decrease in the aluminium content and an improved action as stabilizer for polymer matenals. Compared with phosphonites or phosphinites of the prior art, which have a content of chloride or hydrolysable chlorine of at least 0.8%, determined by argentometric titration, the phosphonites or phosphinites of the invention have a content of<br><br><br>
less than 0.5%, in the particularly pure form, of less than 0.3%. The aluminium content, determined by the AES/ICP (atomic emission spectroscopy/inductively coupled plasma) method, is in each case at least 800 ppm or less than 5OO ppm, respectively. The clear solubility in nonpolar solvents can be measured by means of turbidity in a 10% strength solution in isooctane.<br>
The resultant phosphonites or phosphinites which are improved in their properties, or their mixtures with other compounds already mentioned above, may be used for stabilizing polymer materials. Polymer materials which may be mentioned are as follows:<br>

Polyolefins, i.e. polymers of monoolefins, in particular polyethylene and polypropylene, can be prepared by various processes, especially by the following methods:<br>
a)	free-radical (usually at high pressure and high temperature).<br>
b)	by means of a catalyst, where the catalyst usually comprises one or more metals of groups IVb, Vb, VIb or VIII. These metals usually have one or more ligands such as oxides, halides, aikoxides, esters, ethers, amines, alkyls, alkenyls and/or aryls, which can be either -n- or a-coordinated. These metal complexes can be free or fixed to supports, such as on activated magnesium chloride, titanium chloride, aluminium oxide or silicon oxide. These catalysts can be soluble or insoluble in the polymerization medium. The catalysts can be active as such in the polymerization, or other activators can be used, for example metal alkyls, metal hydrides, metal alkylhalides, metal alkyloxides or metal alkyloxanes, the metals being elements of Groups la, lla and/or Ilia. The activators can be modified, for example, with further ester, ether, amine or silyl ether groups.

For the use examples below, the comparison product used is a phosphonite, which is commercially available as Sandostab P-EPQ from Clariant Huningue S.A. and is prepared according to GB Patent 1372528, Example 12.<br>
USE EXAMPLE A<br>
Comparison of the clear solubilities<br>
10% strength solutions of products 1 to 6 and of the comparison product are prepared by dissolving 10 g of each substance in 90 g of isooctane. The solutions of the products 1 to 6 prepared according to the invention are colorless and transparent, while the solution of the comparison product is opaque and a precipitate is deposited after standing for a short time. As a result, the products of the invention are suitable in particular for adding as homogeneous solutions, additives in homogeneous coatings systems and their prepolymeric components as well as in general for use in transparent end products, such as coatings, powder coatings, polycarbonate, polystyrene, polyethylene terephthalate, polybutylene terephthalate, polyvinyl chloride, polymethylmethacrylate or cyclic olefin copolymers (COC), i.e. any polymeric materials which are present to a high degree in the amorphous state having only small crystalline contents.<br>
USE EXAMPLE B<br>
Comparison of the chloride contents<br>
The contents of chloride or hydrolysable chlonne are determined by argentometric titration with potentiometric end point determination of a product suspension in water. For the products 1 to 4 prepared according to the invention, significantly lower chloride contents are found compared with the comparison product:<br><br><br>
This reduction in chloride content by up to an order of magnitude represents a significant improvement over the prior art which can be achieved without a substantial increase in resources and cost-effectively.<br>
USE EXAMPLE C<br>
Comparison of the aluminium contents<br>
The contents of aluminium are determined by the method AES/ICP. For the products 1 to 6 prepared according to the invention, significantly lower aluminium contents are found compared with the comparison product:<br><br>
This reduction in aluminium content represents a significant improvement over the prior art which can be achieved without a substantial increase in resources and cost-effectively.<br>
USE EXAMPLE D<br>
Test of application<br>
Sample preparation: In a mixer<br>
100	parts of LLDPE (linear low density polyethylene,<br>
Mitsubishi F-30FG-N) powder<br>
0.07	part   of sterically hindered phenol (Irganox 1076) and<br>
0.075, 0.10 or 0.125     part   of the relevant stabilizer<br>
are mixed together in the dry state and homogenized in a Collin single-screw extruder initially at 210°C and then, after granulation, in a Gdttfert Extrusiometer (compression 1:3, 70 min"^) extruded a total of five times at 240°C and granulated. After the first, third, and fifth passage.<br><br>
the melt flow index (MFI) is determined each time (Zwick, 190°C, 2.16 kg). The results obtained are summarized below.<br><br>
The products 1 and 2 of the invention equally show an improved stabilizing action compared with the comparison product, in particular with high demands being placed on the stabilizer action, expressed by an MFI value which is as high (LLDPE is mainly degraded by cross-linking, leading to low MFI-values) and as unchanged as possible, especially after the 5th extrusion passage.<br>
USE EXAMPLE E<br>
Test of application<br>
Sample preparation: In a mixer<br>
100	parts of PP (polypropylene, Solvay Polyolefins Eltex P HL 001PF) powder<br>
0.05	parts of stericaily hindered phenol (IrganoxlOlO) and<br>
0.04	resp.<br>
0.07	parts of the relevant stabilizer<br>
are mixed together in the dry state and homogenized in a Collin single screw extruder initially at 210°C and then, after granulation, in a Gottfert Extrusiometer (compression 1:3, 50 min "") extruded a total of five times at 270°C and granulated. After the first, third and fifth passage, the melt flow index (MFI) is determined each time (Zwick, 230°C, 2.16 kg). The results obtained are summarized below<br><br><br>
The products 2 and 7 equally show improved stabilizing action compared to the comparison product, in particular with high demands being placed on the stabilizer action, expressed by an MFI-value which is as low (PP is degraded by chain scission, leading to high MFI-values) and as unchanged as possible, especially after the 5*^ extrusion passage.<br>
The stabilizing effect is found to be concentration-independent, i.e. not limited to a small concentration range and the results show that the stabilizers prepared according to the invention have a markedly improved specific stabilizing action in various polymers compared with the pnor art (Comparison Product).<br><br><br>
