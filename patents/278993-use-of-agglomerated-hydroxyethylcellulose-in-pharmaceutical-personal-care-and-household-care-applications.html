APPLICATIONS<br>
RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
[0001] This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application Serial No. 60/879855, filed on January 10,2007, which is incorporated herein by reference In its entirety.<br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
[0002]  The present invention is related to a polysaccharide composition and more particularly, to hydroxyethylcellulose compositions which when applied in water are capable of exceptional dispersion, minimum lump formation and very quick hydration to reach maximum desired viscosity. The invention concems use of hydroxyethylcellulose compositions in consumer products, in particular, phamiaceutical, personal care (excluding oral care compositions), as well as household care applications.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENtlON<br>
[0003]   It is well known in the consumer products such as pharmaceutical, personal care (excluding oral care compositions), as well as household care applications to formulate products tiiat provide useful characteristics such as cleansing, cleaning protecting, and benefiting, depositing and moisturizing, and firming, conditioning, providing occlusive barriers, tinting and providing emolliency. In tiiese consumer products water-soluble polymers are used as rheology modifiers for the final compositions. Polysaccharide derivatives such as cellulose ethers, and poi^alactomannan and polygalactomannan derivative products are among the best known polysaccharides for use as rheology modifiers in these applications.<br>
[0004]  Water-soluble polymers are heavily used In a variety of consumer products. Despite their environmentally friendly and biodegradable advantages, they suffer from the tendency to fomn lumps when In contact with water and take much longer to dissolve. Dissolution, by definition, is a loosely used tenn. In this case, dissolution<br>
is used to represent the two steps by which polymers go into aqueous solutions. In the first step, the polynner is dispersed into the aqueous solution. The time it takes the polymer to disperse is subject to'^ good deal of variability. Dispersion could be as short as few seconds or as long as several hours depending on technique, instrumentation, morphology and surface chemistry of the polymer. After &amp;ie polymer is dispersed, the polymer undergoes a hydration step. In this step, polymer chains loosen up and expand their hydrodynamic volume occupying the whole solution and building up viscosity on the way. As soon as polymer molecules contact water, they tend to swell very quickly and get in contact with neighboring particles. They glue together and form lumps of various sizes that tend to delay their hydration time significantly. Good dispersion is a prerequisite for minimal lump fomnation and ultimately quick hydration in final applications. In all systems of water-soluble polymers, lump formation is considered a rate detemnining step for total dissolution time.<br>
[0005]   US Patent No. 5,869,029 discloses compositions comprising water-soluble or water-swetlable polymers agglomerated by treatment with polyols, and the use of these compositions in making toothpastes. The polyols of use in this composition are selected from the group consisting of sugar alcohols, glycerol, polyethylene glycol, propylene glycol, and mixtures thereof. This composition is of utility for producing toothpaste fomnulations.<br>
[0006] US Patent No. 6,258,342 discloses the use of water or aqueous polymers agglomerated water-soluble or water-swellabte polymer in oral care compositions. The oral care composition or dentifrice described in this patent contains abrasives, humectants, and water-soluble polymers.<br>
[0007]   In consumer products and especially in the personal care industry, there is a safety concern regarding presence glyoxal in formulation ingredients. Currently many hydroxyethylcellulose products (HEC) such as (Natrosol HEC, available from Hercules Incorporated) and hydrophobically modified hydroxyethylcellulose products (HMHEC) (Polysurf ® 67 HMHEC available from Hercules Incorporated) are surface treated with glyoxal for ease dispersion by formulators. Gtyoxal-free easily dispersable polymers offer an opportunity of easily incorporating these materials into<br>
consumer product formulations for use in personal care and, household care<br>
applications where there are concerns regarding the presence of glyoxal In the<br>
formulations.	<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0007]  The present invention relates to a composition of agglomerated hydroxyethylcellulose wherein a cellulose ether, more particularly a hydroxyethylcellulose, is used as an agglomerating agent.<br>
[0008]  This invention further is directed to the process for preparing the agglomerated hydroxyethylcellulose compositions mentioned above.<br>
[0009]  This invention is further directed to functional use of agglomerated hydroxyethylcellulose compositions in consumer products such as pharmaceutical, household care and personal care (excluding oral care) compositions. The consumer product comprising a) an agglomerated hydroxyethylcellulose composition, b) a consumer product active ingredient material, and c) water, wherein the agglomerated hydroxethylcellulose composition comprises a particulate hydroxyethylcellulose and a low molecular weight hydroxyethyicellulose composition.<br>

[00018] The consumer product of the present invention comprise an agglomerated HEC composition, a consumer product active ingredient material, and an amount of water.<br>
[00019] Examples of the consumer product active ingredient materials include sun ray (UV) absortaers, sun screen agents, moisturizers, humectants, benefiting agents for hair, skin, nails, depositing agents such as surfactants and polysaccharide polymers, occlusive agents, moisture baniers, lubricants, emollients, anti-aging agents, antistatic agents, abrasive, antimicrobial agents, insect repellent agents, drug delivery agents, secondary conditioners, exfoliants, lustering agents, tanning agents, luminescent, colors, anti-odorizing agents, fragrances, viscosifying agents, salts, lipids, phospholipids, hydrophobic plant extracts, vitamins, foam stabilizers, pH modifiers, preservatives, suspending agents, silicone oils, silicone derivatives, essential oils, oils, fats, fatty acids, fatty acid esters, fatty alcohols, waxes, poiyols, hydrocarbons, dust collectors, polishing agents, stain removing agents, anti-redeposition agents, coloring agents, tinting agents, scrubbing agents, benefiting agents for wood, tiles, and other hard surfaces, automobile treatment agents.<br>
[00020] The following examples will serve to illustrate the invention, parts and percentages being by weight unless otherwise indicated.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
Dispersion Properties with Haake Viscometer Test [00019]   Samples were studied for their dispersion (lumping/no lumping), hydration and dissolution properties with a Haake Model VT5Q1 viscometer. All tests were run in deionized water at 25'C, 300rpm using FL10 sensor.<br>
 [00020]   Other HEC samples (Natrosol® 250HHR CS HEC, Natrosol® 250HX Pharni HEC, and Natrosol® 250HHX Phami HEC, all available from Hercules incorporated) were included as comparative examples. The dispersions were made of examples of the agglomerated HEC of use in the present invention as well as the comparative examples at 0.5% and at 1.0%, see Table 1. The dispersions were mixed either for one (1) hour or two (2) hours and viscosity was measured as a function of time, Figures 1 to 6. The plots provide viscosity with time as measured by Haake viscometer and also %viscosity at given time based on the final viscosity.<br>
Comparative Example 1<br>
[00021]   Natrosol® 250HHR CS HEC (glyoxai treated):<br>
[00022] The Comparative Example 1 took almost 80 minutes to reach 100% of its final viscosity, both at 0.5% and at 1.0%, see Rgures 1 &amp; 2. No pH adjustment was made during the hydration study.<br>
Comparative Example 2<br>
[00023]   Natrosol® 250HXPham HEC (glyoxal-free):<br>
[00024]   At 0.5% concentration, comparative example 2 took about 12 minutes to reach 100% of its final viscosity, Figure 3. No lumping was observed at 0.5% concentration. It took about 30 minutes at 1.0% concentration to reach 100% of its final viscosity, see Figure 4. However, most of the viscosity gain occurred in the first 5 minutes. The 1.0% solution experiment was run in duplicate. In the first experiment a momentary lumping was observed when polymer was first added to water.<br>
Comparative Example 3<br>
[00025]   Natrosol® 250HHX Pharm HEC (glyoxal-free):<br>
[00026]   The sample was not tested at 0.5% level.  At 1.0%, it went-off the scale and the test was aborted.<br>
Example 1 [00027]<br>
   Natrosol® 250HHX-GF HEC (glyoxal-free), HEC agglomerated with 5% of a low viscosity HEC aqueous solution (Natrosol® L HEC available from Hercules incorporated) in a fluid bed dryer.<br>
[00028] Both 0.5% and 1.0% solution test were run in duplicate. It took about 10 minutes to reach 100% of Its final viscosity at 0.5%, and less than 30 minutes at 1.0%. No lumping was observed, see Figure 5 &amp; 6.<br>

(TABLE REMOVED)<br>
Dispersion Properties with Propeller Blade Mixer: [00029]   Solutions of the following polymers were prepared at 1.0% concentrations:<br>
Comparative Example 4 (Natrosol® 250HX Pharm HEC); Comparative Example 5 (Natrosol® 250HHX Pharm HEC); and Example 2 (Natrosol® HHX-GF HEC).<br>
[00030]   The solutions were prepared in an 237 ml (8oz) jar, two propeller blades at 450 rpm, with deionized water and under ambient temperature conditions.<br>
[00031]   No lumping was observed when Example 2 (Natrosol® HHX-GF HEC agglomerated with 5% of a low viscosity HEC aqueous solution (Natrosol® L hydroxyeth^ cellulose available from Hercules Incorporated) in a fluid bed dryer) was first added to the deionized water.<br>
[00032]   Severe large lumping occurred with Comparative Example 4 (Natrosol® 2501-IX Phamn HEC, available from l^rcules Incorporated.) The lump did not dissolve even after two (2) hours of mixing.<br>
[00033]   Severe small lumping occurred initially when Comparative Example 5 (Natrosol® 250HHX Pharm HEC, available from Hercules Incorporated) was added to deionized water, but then the material dissolved in less than a minute.<br>
Other Physical Observations <br>
[00034]   Comparative Example 4 (Natrosol® 250HX Phami HEC); ~ Fine powder, lumpy (not free-flowing) in Its container.<br>
Comparative Example 5 (Natrosol® 250HHX Pharm HEC) - Fine granular material, no caking, dry free-fiowing; and Example 2 (Natrosol® HHX-GF HEC) -Coarse granular, dry free-flowing.<br>
[00035]   The composition of agglomerated hydroxyethylcellulose of use in this invention - agglomerated HEC, Natrosol® 250HHX-GF - provided excellent dispersion &amp; dissolution without the lumping issue experienced by Comparative Examples 4 &amp; 5, ^e Pharm grade products.<br>
Experimental Procedure:<br>
[00036]   The materials tested were:<br>
(Example 3), Dispersible Natrosol® 250HHX-GF HEC agglomerated with 5% of a<br>
low viscosity HEC aqueous solution (Natrosol® L hydroxyethyl cellulose available<br>
from Hercules Incorporated) in a fluid bed dryer;<br>
(Comparative Example 4) Natrosol® 250HX-Pharm HEC;<br>
(Comparative Example 5) Natroso® 250HHX-Pharm HEC; and<br>
(Comparative Example 1) Natrosol® 250HHR-CS HEC.<br>
[00037]   The moisture content of each polymer was detennined using a Sartorius Model MA-30 moisture balance @ lOS^C:<br>
(Example 3) Dispersible Natrosol 250HHX-GF, 1.68% moisture;<br>
 (Comparative Example 4) Natrosol® 250HX-Phann HEC. 3.43% moisture; (Comparative Example 4) Natrosol® 250HX-Phann HEC, 3.88% moisture; (Comparative Example 5) Natrosol©'250HHX-Pharm HEC, 3.26% moisture; and (Comparative Example 1) NatrosoI®250HHR-CS HEC, 4.61% moisture.<br>
[00038]   The weight of polymer in each fonmulation was adjusted for its moisture content.<br>
[00039]   The hydration tests were run on a Haake Model VT-501 Viscometer, equipped with an FL10 sensor. Rotation speed was 300 rpm. The solution batch size was 400 g. The measurement program was divided into eight time segments of varying length; during each segment 50 readings were taken. In these tests the following programs were used:<br>
For one hour tests: -5 minutes/ 5 minutes/ 5 minutes/ 5 minutes/10 minutes/ 10 minutes/10 minutes/10 minutes; for a total of one hour.<br>
For two hour tests: -5 minutes/ 5 minutes/ 10 minutes/ 20 minutes/ 20 minutes/ 20 minutes/ 20 minutes/ 20 minutes; for a total of two hours.<br>
(In the first segment, -5 minutes was specified so that the sensor rotates at the specified speed immediately rather than ramping up to speed over the time segment).<br>
[00040]   After setting up the parameters of the Haake program, the water was charged to a 500 ml jacketed beaker maintained at 25°C from a circulating water bath. The sensor was lowered into the beaker to about 0.6 -1.3 cm (Vi"-V4") from the bottom of the beaker, and located slightly off-center to prevent the dry powder from accumulating on the sensor shaft The sensor rotation was started and the polymer was added quickly to the vortex. The sensor was then centered in the beaker. The program was run until the prescribed end time.<br>
[00041]   The test solution charges were as follows:<br>
