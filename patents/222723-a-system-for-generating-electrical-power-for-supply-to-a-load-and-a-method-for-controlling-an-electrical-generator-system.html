				<td>A SYSTEM FOR GENERATING ELECTRICAL POWER FOR<br>
SUPPLY TO A LOAD AND A METHOD FOR CONTROLLING<br>
AN ELECTRICAL GENERATOR SYSTEM<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to the generation of electrical power using an air-<br>
breathing engine to drive a generator, which produces electrical current for supply<br>
to a load. The invention in particular embodiments relates to the generation of<br>
electrical power using a generator powered by a small turbine engine.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Distributed power generation is a concept that has been the subject of much<br>
discussion over the years, but to date there has not been widespread deployment of<br>
distributed generation systems. Distributed generation refers to the use of small<br>
electrical power generation systems located at the sites where the power is needed,<br>
and thus is to be distinguished from the traditional utility grid system in which a<br>
large central power plant produces power that is then transmitted over substantial<br>
distances to a plurality of users through a system of power transmission lines<br>
commonly referred to as a grid. In contrast to conventional power plants operated<br>
by utilities, which often can produce several megawatts of power, distributed<br>
generation systems are generally sized below two megawatts, and more typically in<br>
the 60 to 600 kilowatt range.<br>
The failure of distributed generation to achieve widespread deployment can<br>
be attributed primarily to cost. In most areas of the United States, and indeed in<br>
much of the world, it simply has been cheaper for most users to purchase power<br>
from the grid than to invest in and operate a distributed generation system. A<br>
major factor driving the relatively high cost of power from distributed generation<br>
systems has been the relatively low efficiency of the small engines used in such<br>
systems, particularly at part-load operation conditions.<br>
Typically, the generator in a distributed generation system is driven by a<br>
small turbine engine, often referred to as a microturbine or miniturbine depending<br>
on size. A turbine engine generally comprises a combustor for burning a fuel and<br>
air mixture to produce hot gases by converting the chemical energy of the fuel into<br>
heat energy, a turbine that expands the hot gases to rotate a shaft on which the<br>
turbine is mounted, and a compressor mounted on or coupled with the shaft and<br>
operable to compress the air that is supplied to the combustor. Because of the<br>
relatively small amount of electrical power required from a distributed generation<br>
system, the turbine engine is correspondingly small. For reasons relating to the<br>
aerodynamics that take place within the engine, and other-reasons, the-efficiency of<br>
a turbine engine tends to decrease with decreasing engine size. Accordingly,<br>
microturbines and miniturbines automatically have an efficiency disadvantage<br>
relative to larger engines.<br>
Furthermore, irrespective of size, the part-load efficiency of a turbine<br>
engine is notoriously poor, generally because of the particular manner in which the<br>
engine is operated at part-load conditions. More particularly, it is typically the<br>
case in turbine engines that the turbine inlet temperature, which essentially<br>
represents the peak temperature of the working fluid in the engine cycle, falls as<br>
the power output from the engine decreases below the "design" point. The design<br>
point is typically a 100 percent rated load condition, and the engine is usually<br>
designed so that its peak efficiency occurs substantially at the design point. It is<br>
well known that the primary variable influencing the efficiency of the<br>
thermodynamic cycle of an engine is the peak temperature of the working fluid.<br>
All other things being equal, the greater the peak temperature, the greater the<br>
efficiency; conversely, the lower the peak temperature, the lower the efficiency.<br>
Therefore, if the engine, when operating at a part-load condition, is controlled in<br>
such a manner that the peak effective temperature of the working fluid in the cycle<br>
(i.e., the turbine inlet temperature) is substantially lower than what it is at the<br>
design point, the efficiency of the engine tends to suffer to a substantial extent.<br>
In some prior-art gas turbines, particularly aircraft gas turbine engines for<br>
propulsion and large gas turbines for constant-speed electrical generator systems,<br>
variable-geometry systems have been used at part-load conditions to reduce the air<br>
flow rate so mat engine efficiency does not unduly suffer. For instance, variable<br>
inlet guide vanes (IGVs) have been used in axial-flow compressors; at part-load<br>
conditions, the IGVs are closed down to reduce the air flow rate for a given<br>
compressor speed. In the case of radial compressors, the stator vanes have<br>
sometimes been made variable for achieving a similar effect. In still other cases,<br>
variable first-stage turbine vanes or nozzles have been employed for controlling the<br>
speed of the turbine and, hence, the speed of the compressor, so as to control air<br>
flow rate. Such variable-geometry systems are expensive, and the bearings and<br>
other movable components are prone to wear, thus making these systems<br>
impractical for electrical generation systems that must be available for service for a<br>
high percentage of hours per year, must be able to operate essentially continuously<br>
if required, and must also be able to respond quickly to changes in the power<br>
required by the load being served. Furthermore, variable-geometry mechanisms<br>
are not practical to implement in microturbines and miniturbines because of the<br>
small size of the engine. Thus, a need exists for an alternative to variable-<br>
geometry methods for optimizing engine performance at part-load conditions.<br>
Emissions (including but not limited to nitrogen oxides, unburned<br>
hydrocarbons, and carbon monoxide) represent another aspect of distributed<br>
generation that has proven challenging. In general, for a given power output, NOX<br>
emissions tend to be reduced or minimized by minimizing the temperature of<br>
combustion of the fuel (also known as the flame temperature), which in general is<br>
higher than the peak thermodynamic temperature (turbine inlet temperature), thus<br>
reducing the production of oxides of nitrogen without adversely affecting<br>
efficiency. The primary method of reducing the flame temperature is to premix the<br>
fuel and air prior to the combustion zone to produce a mixture with a high relative<br>
ratio of fuel to air, i.e., a lean mixture. The premixing also assures that the<br>
temperature throughout the flame zone is very nearly uniform without hot spots<br>
that can lead to the local production of NOx. However, as the mixture is made<br>
leaner, carbon monoxide (CO), unburned hydrocarbon (UHC), and pressure<br>
fluctuations increase. These trends continue and the flame zone becomes more<br>
unstable as the mixture is made still leaner, until the lean extinction limit is<br>
reached. For mixtures any leaner than this limit, no flame can be sustained. In<br>
practice, carbon monoxide and unburned hydrocarbon emissions and/or pressure<br>
pulsations become unacceptably high before the lean extinction limit is reached.<br>
The lean extinction limit may be moved to leaner regimes by increasing the<br>
inlet temperature to the combustor and by using catalytic combustion. The use of<br>
catalytic combustion substantially increases the operating regime for lean premixed<br>
combustion, resulting in very low NOX emission, acceptable CO and UHC<br>
emissions, and essentially no pressure pulsations. Catalytic combustion does,<br>
however, introduce another constraint on operation called the lower catalytic<br>
activity limit. The inlet temperature to the catalytic combustor must be kept above<br>
this limit to sustain catalytic combustion.<br>
In many conventional microturbines, the engine control is such that at part-<br>
load conditions the combustor inlet temperature tends to fall and the fuel/air<br>
mixture becomes leaner. In the case of conventional lean pre-mixed combustion,<br>
this tends to result in increased emissions; in the case of catalytic combustion, the<br>
falling combustor inlet temperature can lead to failure to sustain catalytic<br>
combustion. In practice, lean-premixed and catalytic combustors are able to<br>
operate over only a portion of the load range of the gas turbine because of falling<br>
combustor inlet temperatures and the progressively leaner conditions that prevail<br>
as load is decreased.<br>
In some cases, pre-burners have been used before combustors for boosting<br>
the combustor inlet temperature. Additionally, variable-geometry combustors have<br>
been used in which a portion of the air is diverted around the combustor to<br>
maintain the fuel/air ratio at a level allowing operational stability. The pre-burner<br>
solution poses a reliability penalty in that over-temperature or other malfunction of<br>
the pre-bumer can damage the main burner, and also adds to the cost of the system.<br>
In addition, it imposes an operating cost penalty as a result of the pressure loss that<br>
occurs through the pre-burner; this pressure loss is experienced even when the pre-<br>
bumer is not in use. Variable geometry can be applied to eliminate the pressure<br>
loss penalty in addition to its use in maintaining fuel/air ratio. However, variable<br>
geometry solutions are costly, complicated, and prone to excessive wear,<br>
decreasing reliability and increasing maintenance costs.<br>
For many potential users, these factors have combined to make electrical<br>
power generation via distributed generation systems less attractive than purchasing<br>
power from the large utilities.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention addresses the above needs and achieves other<br>
advantages, by providing an electrical power generating system and method<br>
wherein, at any operating condition, for a given power output the engine efficiency<br>
is substantially optimized by controlling the rate of air flow through the engine in<br>
such a manner that the fuel/air ratio is controlled to maintain a high peak<br>
femperature imparted to the working fluid in the engine. The method and system<br>
of the invention eliminate the need for variable-geometry mechanisms in the<br>
engine, eliminate the need for variable-geometry combustors, and also minimize<br>
the need for pre-burners. The invention is applicable to various types of air-<br>
breathing engines that operate at low fuel/air ratios, including but not limited to<br>
rotary engines such as turbine engines and reciprocating engines such as free<br>
piston engines.<br>
In accordance with a method aspect of the invention, a method is provided<br>
for improving part-load efficiency of an air-breathing engine in an electrical<br>
generator system. The system has a movable shaft mechanically communicating<br>
with the engine and a fuel system coupled with the engine and operable to supply<br>
fuel to the engine at a controlled fuel flow rate; the engine is designed such that<br>
peak thermodynamic efficiency of the engine substantially coincides with a 100<br>
percent load operating condition of the engine. The system includes an electrical<br>
generator coupled to the shaft such that movement of the shaft by the engine<br>
causes the generator to operate to create an alternating electrical current, and the<br>
engine, shaft, and generator are connected such that a change in speed of the<br>
generator causes a corresponding change in speed of the engine and hence a<br>
change in rate of air flow through the engine. The method comprises the steps of<br>
operating the engine at a part-load condition, and controlling the speed of the<br>
generator at the part-load condition so as to control air flow rate through the engine<br>
while simultaneously controlling fuel flow rate to the engine so as to control<br>
fuel/air ratio in such a manner that a peak cycle temperature of the engine is<br>
substantially the same as the peak cycle temperature corresponding to the 100<br>
percent load operating condition. In other words, the peak cycle temperature is not<br>
allowed to drop by any substantial extent when reducing load below the 100<br>
percent load condition (although at very low load conditions the peak cycle<br>
temperature may be allowed to drop, as further described below). This is<br>
accomplished by controlling the fuel/air ratio, primarily through control of the air<br>
flow rate through the engine. Since the air flow rate is a function of the speed of<br>
the engine, the air flow rate can be controlled by controlling the generator speed.<br>
In one embodiment, the step of controlling the speed of the generator<br>
comprises controlling an electrical current level downstream of the generator. This<br>
can be accomplished by converting the alternating current from the generator into a<br>
direct current and then converting the direct current into an alternating current at a<br>
fixed frequency independent of the speed of the generator; the fixed-frequency<br>
alternating current would then be supplied to the load. Using active current control<br>
in the AC-to-DC conversion, the level of the direct current is controlled so as to<br>
control the generator speed. For example, at a substantially constant fuel flow rate,<br>
by decreasing the direct current, a reduction in load on the shaft occurs and hence<br>
the generator speeds up so that output voltage is increased to maintain an overall<br>
energy balance; conversely, increasing the direct current increases the load on the<br>
shaft such that the generator slows down.<br>
When a wound generator having an excitation system is employed, the<br>
control of generator speed may be accomplished at least in part by controlling the<br>
excitation system. Alternatively, the speed of the wound generator may be<br>
controlled by controlling the AC/DC converter as previously noted, or a<br>
combination of controlling the excitation system and controlling the AC/DC<br>
converter may be used.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, a recuperator is used to pre-heat<br>
the air mat is mixed with the fuel, or to pre-heat the air-fuel mixture; the<br>
recuperator causes heat exchange between the air or mixture and the exhaust gases<br>
discharged from the engine. At very low part-load conditions, if the peak cycle<br>
temperature were maintained at the same level as the 100 percent load point, the<br>
temperature of the exhaust gases entering the recuperator could exceed a maximum<br>
allowable value (dictated by material limits, for example). Accordingly, in<br>
accordance with the invention, at such conditions, the generator speed is controlled<br>
so as to control air flow rate through the engine and thereby control fuel/air ratio in<br>
such a manner that the peak cycle temperature is allowed to fall below the peak<br>
cycle temperature corresponding to the 100 percent load operating condition;<br>
accordingly, the temperature of the exhaust gases entering the recuperator does not<br>
exceed the predetermined maximum allowable value.<br>
In another aspect of the invention, the fuel is combusted in a catalytic<br>
conibustor having a predetermined minimum inlet temperature required for<br>
maintenance of a catalytic reaction in the combustor. In many conventional engine<br>
control schemes, the combustor inlet temperature tends to fall as engine load is<br>
reduced below the 100 percent load condition; accordingly, it is possible for the<br>
temperature to fall below the minimum temperature required for the catalytic<br>
reaction. In accordance with the invention, the fuel/air ratio is controlled in such a<br>
manner at part-load conditions that an inlet temperature to the combustor is at least<br>
as great as the predetermined minimum inlet temperature. In one embodiment, the<br>
fuel/air ratio is controlled in such a manner that the inlet temperature to the<br>
combustor at a part-load condition is greater than the inlet temperature to the<br>
combustor at the 100 percent load condition.<br>
A system for generating electrical power for supply to a load, in accordance<br>
with one embodiment of the invention, includes an air-breathing engine<br>
mechanically communicating with a movable shaft. An electrical generator is<br>
coupled to the shaft such that movement of the shaft by the engine causes the<br>
generator to operate to create an alternating electrical current. The engine, shaft,<br>
and generator are connected such that a change in speed of the generator causes a<br>
corresponding change in speed of the engine and hence a change in rate of air flow<br>
through the engine. The system further includes a fuel system coupled with the<br>
engine and operable to supply fuel to the engine, the fuel system being responsive<br>
to a fuel control signal to vary a rate of fuel flow to the engine; and at least one<br>
engine sensor operable to measure at least one thermodynamic variable associated<br>
with the engine that is indicative of a relative thermodynamic efficiency of the<br>
engine.<br>
A power electronics unit is coupled to the generator for receiving the<br>
alternating electrical current therefrom and synthesizing an alternating output<br>
current at a predetermined frequency for supply to the load. The power electronics<br><br>
unit in one embodiment comprises an AC/DC module structured and arranged to<br>
operate upon the alternating electrical current from the generator so as to produce a<br>
non-alternating direct current at a non-alternating voltage, and a DC/AC module<br>
structured and arranged to operate upon the non-alternating direct current so as to<br>
synthesize an alternating output current and voltage at a predetermined frequency<br>
and relative phase for supply to the load. In one embodiment, the AC/DC module<br>
can be responsive to a current control signal to vary the level of the non-alternating<br>
direct current independently of the alternating electrical current from the generator.<br>
The system also includes a generator power sensor operable to measure<br>
power output from the system, and a load power sensor operable to measure power<br>
demanded by the load. A controller is operably connected to the fuel system, to<br>
the at least one engine sensor, to the power electronics unit, to the generator power<br>
sensor, and to the load power sensor. The controller is operable to control the fuel<br>
system so as to cause the power output from the system to substantially match the<br>
power demanded by the load, and simultaneously to control the speed of the<br>
generator so as to control engine speed (and hence air flow rate), in such a manner<br>
that fuel/air ratio of the mixture burned in the engine is controlled to substantially<br>
maximize the relative thermodynamic efficiency of the engine.<br>
Generator speed control can be accomplished by controlling the level of the<br>
non-alternating direct current from the AC/DC module of the power electronics<br>
unit, in the case of an actively controllable AC/DC module. In another<br>
embodiment wherein the generator is a wound generator having an excitation<br>
system, the control system can be operable to control the excitation system so as to<br>
control generator speed and hence air flow rate.<br>
In a system as described above, another method in accordance with the<br>
invention comprises the steps of:<br>
determining a power demanded by the load;<br>
measuring at least one thermodynamic variable associated with the<br>
engine that is indicative of a relative thermodynamic efficiency of the<br>
engine;<br>
controlling the fuel supply system to supply fuel to the engine at a<br>
controlled fuel flow rate such that the electrical power output from the<br>
system substantially matches the power demanded by the load; and<br>
controlling the air flow rate through the engine independently of the<br>
electrical power output from the system so as to control fuel/air ratio of the<br>
mixture burned in the engine in such a manner as to substantially optimize<br>
the thermodynamic efficiency of the engine while substantially matching<br>
the power demanded by the load, the air flow rate being controlled by<br>
electrically controlling the speed of the generator and hence the air flow<br>
rate through the engine.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present inventions now will be described more fully hereinafter with<br>
reference to the accompanying drawings, in which some, but not all embodiments<br>
of the invention are shown. Indeed, these inventions may be embodied in many<br>
different forms and should not be construed as limited to the embodiments set forth<br>
herein; rather, these embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will satisfy<br>
applicable legal requirements. Like numbers refer to like elements throughout.<br>
An electrical generator system 10 in accordance with one embodiment of<br>
the invention is schematically shown in FIG. 1. The system includes an air-<br>
breathing engine 20 that burns a mixture of fuel and air to produce hot combustion<br>
gases that are then expanded to create mechanical power. In the illustrated<br>
embodiment, the engine comprises a turbine engine having a compressor 22<br>
mounted on one end of a rotatable shaft 24, a turbine 26 mounted on the other end<br>
of the shaft, and a combustor 28 for burning the fuel/air mixture. The combustor<br>
can be of various types, including but not limited to diffusion flame, catalytic, lean<br>
pre-mixed, or others. A mixture of fuel and air is supplied to the combustor. The<br>
air is first pressurized by the compressor. The fuel/air mixture is burned in the<br>
combustor and the hot combustion gases are supplied to the turbine, which expands<br>
the gases, causing the turbine to be rotatably driven. The turbine in turn rotates the<br>
shaft, which drives the compressor.<br>
The system includes an electrical generator 30 in communication with the<br>
shaft 24 in such a manner that movement of the shaft causes the generator to be<br>
driven. In the illustrated embodiment in which the shaft is rotatable, the generator<br>
is likewise rotatable, and rotary motion of the shaft is imparted to the generator.<br>
The generator can be directly mounted on or connected to the shaft such that a one-<br>
to-one speed relationship exists between the shaft and the generator, or<br>
alternatively the generator and shaft can be connected through a gear train or the<br>
like so that a different speed relationship exists. It is also possible for the shaft to<br>
be reciprocating rather than rotary, and for the generator to be either reciprocating<br>
or rotary. In any event, the speed at which the generator operates dictates the<br>
speed of the shaft, and hence the speed at which the engine operates.<br>
The generator 30 can be of various types, including permanent magnet<br>
generators or wound generators, or combinations thereof. The generator produces<br>
an alternating electrical current and voltage. As further described below, in the<br>
illustrated embodiment the alternating electrical current from the generator is<br>
operated on by power electronics to produce an alternating output current and<br>
voltage at a predetermined fixed frequency and phase relationship for supply to a<br>
load.<br>
The system 10 also includes a fuel system for supplying fuel to the<br>
combustor 28. The fuel system generally includes a fuel pump (not shown) and a<br>
fuel metering valve 32 that is controllable by a suitable control signal 34 so as to<br>
control the fuel flow rate. A control system 40 is connected to the fuel metering<br>
valve 32 for controlling its operation. The control system also performs other<br>
functions as further described below.<br>
The system 10 can also include an optional recuperator 50 comprising a<br>
heat exchanger for transferring heat from engine exhaust gases 52 to the<br>
compressed air 54 discharged from the compressor 22 before the air is supplied to<br>
the combustor. The recuperator captures some of the waste heat that would<br>
otherwise be lost and uses it to preheat the combustion air and thereby increase the<br>
overall efficiency of the engine, as known in the art.<br>
As noted, the system 10 also includes power electronics. In the illustrated<br>
embodiment, the power electronics comprise an AC/DC converter 60 and a<br>
DC/AC module or inverter 70. The AC/DC converter 60 can comprise any<br>
suitable converter operable to convert the alternating electrical current produced by<br>
the generator, which can vary in frequency as the speed of the generator varies,<br>
into a non-alternating direct current, and further operable in a current-control mode<br>
to control the level of the direct current independently of the characteristics of the<br>
alternating input current (within certain limits). Such active current control is<br>
generally based on pulse-width modulation (PWM) schemes utilizing<br>
semiconductor switching devices that perform switching operations at a high<br>
frequency and effectively allow current to pass only during a portion of each<br>
period of the input current waveform. This "time window" during which current is<br>
allowed to pass can be varied in duration so as to vary the "average" current output<br>
from the converter.<br>
The DC/AC module or inverter 70 then processes the output from the<br>
AC/DC converter 60 so as to synthesize an alternating output current at a fixed<br>
frequency. In many countries, the standard mains frequency is 60 cycles per<br>
second, while in other countries it is 50 cycles per second. The output frequency<br>
from the inverter is selected to match the standard mains frequency used in the<br>
particular location at which the system 10 is to be operated.<br><br>
The system 10 also includes a number of sensors connected to the control<br>
system 40 for measuring various parameters. For instance, an output power meter<br>
72 is arranged for measuring how much electrical power is being generated by the<br>
system. One or more engine sensors 74 monitor one or more thermodynamic<br>
variables associated with the engine cycle. The thermodynamic variables are used<br>
for determining where the engine is operating on its "map", i.e., whether the engine<br>
is running at or near its design point or is running off-design. For example, a<br>
turbine inlet temperature sensor can be used for measuring turbine inlet<br>
temperature. As previously noted, the turbine inlet temperature represents the peak<br>
temperature of the working fluid in the engine and generally correlates with overall<br>
efficiency of the engine. Hence, by measuring turbine inlet temperature along with<br>
other parameters, it is possible to deduce a relative thermodynamic efficiency of<br>
the engine.<br>
A sensor 76 measures an inlet temperature to the recuperator 50 in the<br>
exhaust-gas stream. At part-load conditions, if the engine is not properly<br>
controlled, the inlet temperature to the recuperator could exceed the maximum<br>
allowable level dictated by material limits. Accordingly, the control system<br>
advantageously is connected to the sensor 76 for monitoring the recuperator inlet<br>
temperature, and the control system adjusts the air flow rate through the engine to<br>
prevent the temperature from exceeding the material limit, while maintaining the<br>
turbine inlet temperature as high as possible within this additional constraint.<br>
It may not be necessary to actually deduce a relative thermodynamic<br>
efficiency, but merely to measure one or more parameters that are indicative of the<br>
relative efficiency or the operating condition of the engine. For example, as noted,<br>
it is known that for a given power output from the engine (and hence a given<br>
power output from the generator as measured by the power meter 72), engine<br>
efficiency generally will be optimized by maximizing the turbine inlet temperature.<br>
Accordingly, control of the fuel/air ratio, through control of the air flow rate, can<br>
be effected so as to maximize the turbine inlet temperature, within allowable<br>
limits. More particularly, the materials of the turbine inlet nozzles have a<br>
maximum allowable temperature that should not be exceeded, in order to preserve<br>
sufficient material strength and integrity to avoid failure of the parts. At the 100<br>
percent load design point, generally the engine would be designed so that turbine<br>
inlet temperature is at or near this maximum allowable temperature. For lower<br>
load conditions, air flow can be controlled in such a manner that the turbine inlet<br>
temperature does not fall substantially below what it is at the design point.<br>
Where the system includes a recuperator 50, considerations of material<br>
limits in the recuperator may necessitate a departure from this constant turbine<br>
inlet temperature mode of operation. More particularly, at very low part-load<br>
conditions, if the turbine inlet temperature were maintained at the same level as the<br>
100 percent load point, the temperature of the exhaust gases entering the<br>
recuperator could exceed a maximum allowable value dictated by material limits of<br>
the recuperator. Accordingly, in accordance with the invention, at such conditions,<br>
the generator speed can be controlled so as to control air flow rate through the<br>
engine (while simultaneously controlling fuel flow rate to the engine) so as to<br>
control fuel/air ratio in such a manner that the turbine inlet temperature is allowed<br>
to fall below the temperature corresponding to the 100 percent load operating<br>
condition. In this manner, the temperature of the exhaust gases entering the<br>
recuperator can be prevented from exceeding the predetermined maximum<br>
allowable value.<br>
Thus, for example, the control system 40 may have stored in memory a<br>
predetermined schedule of turbine inlet temperature versus relative generator load.<br>
The relative generator load, which is reflected by the power output measured by<br>
the power meter 72, generally indicates the relative engine load and hence gives an<br>
indication of where the engine is operating on its map. A suitable control<br>
algorithm can be used by the control system 40 to control air flow (via control of<br>
generator speed in some suitable manner, such as by controlling the DC current<br>
from the AC/DC converter 60) in such a manner that the turbine inlet temperature<br>
is caused to substantially match the value dictated by the predetermined schedule.<br>
This is merely a simplified example of one possible control scheme, and other<br>
schemes may be used in accordance with the invention.<br>
FIG. 2 shows what such a turbine inlet temperature versus relative<br>
generator load schedule might look like, and compares various temperatures at<br>
different points in the system 10 (solid lines) with corresponding temperatures that<br><br>
would exist if a prior-art type of control approach were taken (dashed lines). In<br>
accordance with the invention, at a relative generator load value of 100 percent<br>
(i.e., the design point for the engine), turbine inlet temperature is substantially<br>
equal to a maximum allowable turbine inlet temperature of about 1200 K. The<br>
turbine inlet temperature is maintained at this value down to a relative generator<br>
load of about 40 percent. In contrast, in the prior-art control approach, the turbine<br>
inlet temperature steadily drops as the load drops below 100 percent.<br>
Consequently, at the same relative load, the overall engine efficiency is higher for<br>
the control scheme in accordance with the invention than for the prior-art control<br>
scheme.<br>
At a relative load of 40 percent, it can be seen that the turbine exit<br>
temperature (which is essentially equal to the recuperator inlet temperature) has<br>
increased up to the maximum allowable recuperator temperature of about 900 K.<br>
At still lower loads, if the turbine inlet temperature were maintained at about 1200<br>
K, the turbine exit temperature would exceed the maximum allowable recuperator<br>
temperature. Accordingly, in accordance with the invention, the turbine inlet<br>
temperature is allowed to drop below 1200 K.<br>
Another factor that can influence the control schedule arises when the<br>
combustor 28 is a catalytic combustor. As noted, catalytic combustors have a<br>
minimum inlet temperature that must be maintained in order to sustain the catalytic<br>
reaction. In the prior-art control approach, it can be seen in FIG. 2 that below a<br>
relative load of about 50 percent the combustor inlet temperature falls below this<br>
minimum temperature of about 800 K. In accordance with the invention, however,<br>
the combustor inlet temperature rises from about 800 K at the 100 percent load<br>
point to about 860 K at the 40 percent load point. Below 40 percent load, the<br>
combustor inlet temperature remains about constant at approximately 860 K. The<br>
invention thus enables efficiency improvements to be realized at part-load<br>
conditions while also allowing proper operation of the catalytic combustor at all<br>
operating points.<br>
FIG. 3 illustrates how the fuel/air ratio behaves in both the inventive<br>
control approach using air flow control and the prior-art control approach not using<br>
air flow control. In the case of flow control, the fuel/air ratio is generally<br><br>
substantially higher at part-load conditions than in the prior-art method. The<br>
higher fuel/air ratio with flow control reflects the fact that the air flow rate is lower<br>
than in the prior-art control approach. From 100 percent down to 40 percent load,<br>
the fuel/air ratio using flow control decreases at a relatively low rate; the result is<br>
that turbine inlet temperature is maintained substantially constant as already noted<br>
in FIG. 2. Below 40 percent load, the fuel/air ratio with flow control is allowed to<br>
decrease at a substantially higher rate.<br>
It will also be noted from FIG. 2 that the combustor inlet temperature is<br>
generally higher in the inventive control approach than in the prior-art approach.<br>
Advantageously, a higher fuel/air ratio and higher combustor inlet temperature<br>
generally favor lower emissions for pre-mixed low-emissions combustors.<br>
The control scheme described thus far has assumed that turbine inlet<br>
temperature is measured directly and used as a control parameter. In some cases,<br>
however, it may not be practical to measure turbine inlet temperature because of<br>
the extreme usage environment in which a turbine inlet temperature sensor would<br>
have to operate. Alternatively, therefore, it is possible to measure other<br>
thermodynamic variables in the engine cycle and deduce the turbine inlet<br>
temperature based on cycle calculations. As still another alternative, the control<br>
system could store a schedule of a suitable control parameter (e.g., engine air flow<br>
rate) versus relative generator load, and thermodynamic variables could be<br>
measured enabling the control parameter to be deduced; the control system would<br>
then drive the actual (i.e., deduced) control parameter to substantially equal the<br>
scheduled value.<br>
The particular control method that is used, and the parameters measured for<br>
effecting the method, are not critical. The basic concept of the invention entails<br>
controlling air flow rate through the engine as a means of enhancing or optimizing<br>
the overall engine efficiency for any given power output from the generator system<br>
10.<br>
At the same time, in a load-following operational mode, the power output<br>
from the generator system 10 must be controlled to match the power demanded by<br>
the load. The power output is primarily a function of the fuel flow rate.<br><br>
Accordingly, in a load-following mode, the control system 40 simultaneously<br>
controls air flow as described above while also controlling the power output (as<br>
measured by power meter 72) to match the demand. Load-following control<br>
schemes are well known and hence are not further described herein.<br>
Depending on the particular application, the system 10 may also be<br>
operated in modes other than load-following. In such cases, the same type of air<br>
flow control already described would still be employed.<br>
The system 10 described above has a single-spool turbine engine 20.<br>
However, the invention is not limited to any particular type of air-breathing engine.<br>
Multiple-spool turbine engines, turbine engines having a free power turbine, rotary<br>
combustion (e.g., Wankel) engines, reciprocating piston engines, and others can be<br>
used. In each case, the air flow rate through the engine is controlled by controlling<br>
generator speed.<br>
The generator 30 can be of various types, including permanent magnet<br>
generators and wound generators. The previously described embodiment of the<br>
system 10 assumed that the generator 30 is a permanent magnet generator in which<br>
mere is no excitation system. In the case of a wound generator, on the other hand,<br>
the generator requires an excitation system 80 (FIG. 1) for supplying an excitation<br>
current to the rotor windings, as known in the art. The excitation system can<br>
comprise, for example, a small generator mounted on the same shaft as the rotor or<br>
mechanically coupled (e.g., by a drive belt) to the rotor shaft.<br>
Regardless of the generator type, the invention entails electrically<br>
controlling the generator speed so as to control the air flow rate through the engine<br>
and thereby optimize engine efficiency and possibly achieve other effects as<br>
previously noted. In the case of a permanent magnet generator, the control of the<br>
generator is accomplished by controlling the AC/DC converter or rectifier 60 as<br>
already described. In the case of a wound generator, a number of control schemes<br>
are possible. In one scheme, the control system 40 controls the excitation system<br>
80 (via control line 82) to regulate the generator speed. The AC/DC and DC/AC<br>
conversion may not be necessary, and instead an AC/AC converter may be used to<br>
synthesize the AC output current at the desired frequency for supply to the load.<br><br>
Alternatively, the AC/DC and DC/AC converters may be used as previously<br>
described, in which case the AC/DC converter does not have to be current-<br>
controlled since the regulation of generator speed is performed by controlling the<br>
excitation system.<br>
In another scheme, generator speed control may be accomplished through a<br>
combination of controlling the excitation system and controlling the AC/DC<br>
converter. Yet another scheme is to control the generator speed solely through<br>
control of the AC/DC converter as already described.<br>
The particulars of how the generator speed is controlled are not critical to<br>
the invention, and various schemes for accomplishing this can be used in<br>
accordance with the invention.<br>
Advantageously, the invention allows control over the thermodynamic<br>
cycle of an engine having fixed-geometry compressor, turbine, and combustor<br>
components.<br>
