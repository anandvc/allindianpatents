				<td>PRE-FORM AND METHOD OF PREPARING A PRE-FORM<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to fibre-reinforced composites. In particular, the invention relates to a<br>
semi-manufacture comprising a resin and several layers of fibre tows.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Pre-forms comprising resin and fibres are known in the prior art.<br>
US-patent 6,139,942 discloses a pre-form with a stack of partially impregnated fabric and<br>
un-impregnated fabric. The layers of such a stack may slide before curing and hence be<br>
difficult to handle, it is suggested to use cross-ply stitching to prevent this, however, this<br>
process is tedious and may introduce undesirable restrictions to the shape of the stack<br>
during curing.<br>
EP-patent 0 475 883 also discloses a pre-form with a plurality of oriented fibre layers.<br>
However, the pre-form requires infusion of a resin to cure which may be time-consuming<br>
and to some extent prevent rearranging of the fibres and resin during curing.<br>
WO 02/090089 discloses a moulding material having a ventilating structure in the otherwise<br>
continuous resin layers. The ventilating structure is designed to allow gas to be removed<br>
from the moulding material during processing in the plane of the resin and/or in the plane of<br>
the reinforcement material. As the ground plan of the moulding material increases, this will<br>
become a still less safe way to remove gas from the moulding material due to the increasing<br>
risk of plugging during processing.<br>
EP 0 033 224 concerns a material for forming fibre reinforced structures with a thermoplastic<br>
resin. The thermoplastic resin is provided by passing the fibres through a bath with<br>
thermoplastic resin or by mixing dry fibres with thermoplastic fibres and heat the collection.<br>
From these coated fibres is formed by weaving or knitting. The description specifically<br>
teaches away from the use of thermosetting resins.<br>
EP 1 145 841 concerns a material consisting of "fibre bundle layers". Each fibre bundle<br>
layer consists of apparently fully wetted fibre bundles and thermosetting resin and the<br>
individual layers are oriented so that the fibres of different layers are oriented differently.<br><br>
DE 198 09 264 concerns a material consisting of a number of fibre layers, each layer having<br>
an individual orientation, and a melting adhesive. The preferred and only described melting<br>
adhesives are thermoplastic adhesives (Schmelzklebergebilde aus thermoplastischem<br>
Polymermaterial, p3, I 3-7).<br>
FR 2794400 concerns a method of manufacturing a composite material from fibrous sheets.<br>
The starting material is prepregs, i.e. impregnated textile sheets of fibres. The sheets are<br>
stacked and knitted together, whereupon the stack is wrapped in a surface layer. Since the<br>
fibres are fixed in a textile and furthermore impregnated prior to the resin infusion, the<br>
mobility of the fibres is limited. Therefore, the ability of the prepreg to form a homogeneous<br>
material during resin infusion, pre-consolidation and curing is considerably lower than pre-<br>
forms based on fibre tows, which is the subject-matter of the present invention.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is the object of the invention to provide a pre-form that may be used for manufacture of<br>
reinforced composites and which poses good reproducibility, low porosity and good physical<br>
properties.<br>
It is a further object of the invention to provide a pre-form and a method of production of a<br>
pre-form that are adaptable to automated processing.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
The above and more objects are realised by the invention as described and explained with<br>
reference to the accompanying drawings and preferred embodiments.<br>
A pre-form is a composite material comprising fibres and - unless otherwise stated - an<br>
uncured resin. The fibres are preferably provided in layers of oriented fibres like for<br>
example fibre tows or prepregs. Fibre tows are advantageous over prepregs. Furthermore,<br>
fibre tows are more advantageous over prepregs in that they may be provided in<br>
the pre-form with a greater freedom, the price is lower as well as the amount of<br>
waste may be lower. The invention provides a pre-form comprising a resin and at least<br>
two layers of oriented fibre tows, however, the advantage of using a pre-form or a method<br>
according to the present invention will increase as the number of layers of oriented fibre<br><br>
tows are increased. Hence, the pre-form preferably comprises at least three layers of<br>
oriented fibre tows. A higher number of layers like e.g. 4, 5, 8, 10, 15, 20, 50,100 or more<br>
layers may be used within the scope of the invention.<br>
Besides fibres and resin, a pre-form according to the invention may for example contain one<br>
or more of fillers (e.g. a cheap inert material) and/or solvents and/or diluents and/or<br>
rheological agents and/or viscosity adjusting agent.<br>
The layers of oriented fibres are fibre tows contrary to pre pregs, since this provides a higher<br>
degree of freedom of design and will allow for a lower viscosity and mobility of fibres during<br>
subsequent processing of a pre-form, e.g. pre-consolidation or curing. Furthermore, pre-<br>
forms prepared from fibre tows are advantageous over pre-forms prepared from prepregs in<br>
that the cost of production is lower as well as the amount of waste is typically lower. Fibre<br>
tows are bundles of a large number of individual fibres, e.g. 1,000's, 10,000's or 100,000's of<br>
fibres.<br>
It may be theorised that the strength of a composite depends amongst others on the<br>
strength of the interface between the fibres and the matrix material (i.e. the cured resin). As<br>
the stiffness of the fibre is increased, the sensitivity to the strength of the interface is also<br>
increased. Presence of porosity may weaken the interface but the actual effect of the<br>
porosity depends for example on the positioning and the size of the pores. Generally<br>
speaking, the greater the pores and the greater the amount of pores, the worse. Another<br>
aspect is the wetting of the fibres. The difficulty in getting a good vetting of the fibres<br>
increases as the fibre diameter is decreased. The processes and products of the present<br>
invention are particularly advantageous for pre-forms comprising thin and stiff fibres like for<br>
example carbon fibres, however, these processes and products are also superior to the prior<br>
art when other types of fibres are used as reinforcement like for example glass fibres,<br>
aramid fibres, synthetic fibres (e.g. acrylic, polyester, PAN, PET, PE, PP or PBO-fibres), bio<br>
fibres (e.g. hemp, jute, cellulose fibres etc.), mineral fibres (e.g. Rockwool™), metal fibres<br>
(e.g. steel, aluminium, brass, copper, etc.) or boron fibres.<br>
Traditionally, gas enclosed in the pre-form prior to and during curing has traditionally been<br>
removed in the direction of the fibres, i.e. in the plane of a resin layer. Hence, the larger the<br>
structure, the longer the gas has to travel to be released from the structure. The risk that gas<br><br>
becomes trapped inside a cured structure is hence increased with the size of the structure. It<br>
appears that the problem with entrapped gas is particularly pronounced when the<br>
reinforcement is unidirectional fibres. It may be speculated that this is due to the very close<br>
packing of the fibres, which may arise in some areas of a composite reinforced by<br>
unidirectional fibres. However, problems concerning entrapped gas may also be present in<br>
other types of fibre orientations e.g. biaxial or random orientations and the inventive idea of<br>
the present invention is hence advantageous for any type of fibre orientation even if the<br>
advantage is greatest when using a unidirectional fibre orientation.<br>
By gas is herein meant entrapped atmospheric air as well as gaseous products, by-products<br>
and starting materials related to the preparation process.<br>
The fibres may be a mixture of more than one type of fibres. For example, a combination of<br>
glass fibres and carbon fibres may be used, but any combination of two or more of the fibre<br>
types mentioned herein are feasible. The mixture may be homogeneous, with different<br>
concentrations in separate fibre layers or with different concentrations of fibres within any<br>
fibre layer. Mixing of fibres may be advantageous, since this opens for tailoring of material<br>
properties, for example from a combined stress/cost-perspective, or parts of a pre-form<br>
particularly suitable for connecting to other materials may be provided. However, in a<br>
preferred embodiment, the fibres are primarily or exclusively carbon fibres.<br>
By carbon fibres is hereinafter meant fibres where the main component is carbon. Hence, by<br>
this definition carbon fibres comprise fibres with graphite, amorphous carbon or carbon<br>
nano-tubes. Thus, carbon fibres produced via for example a polyacrylonitril-route and a<br>
pitch-based route are comprised by this definition.<br>
By fibres are hereinafter meant particles having an aspect ratio (length/equivalent diameter)<br>
of more than 10. By equivalent diameter is meant the diameter of a circle having the same<br>
area as the cross sectional area of the particle. However, in a preferred embodiment, the<br>
fibres are continuous fibres, i.e. fibres that substantially run from one edge of a pre-form to<br>
another.<br>
It is preferred to use thermosetting resin for reasons of chemical and thermal stability as well<br>
as ease of processing. It is further preferred that the resin is an epoxy-based or a polyester-<br><br>
based resin, most preferably an epoxy-based resin. The resin may comprise more than one<br>
resin system. It may be advantageous to use more than one resin system to be able to<br>
optimise the properties of the resin for the subsequent steps of processing, for example with<br>
respect to viscosity and timing/controlling of the curing process. These systems may or may<br>
not be based on the same type of resin, however, it is preferred that such systems are based<br>
on the same type of resin like for example two or more epoxy-based systems, In another<br>
preferred embodiment, the resin types differ but the resins are compatible.<br>
The method according to the invention is adapted to automated processing. For example,<br>
the layers of oriented fibre tows, the adhesive and the resin may advantageously be<br>
distributed by a robot. The automation is facilitated by an at least partial immobilisation of<br>
fibres by an adhesive, which will prevent or at least greatly reduce disturbance in the layers<br>
of oriented fibre tows. When the adhesive is only applied to selected areas of the ground<br>
plan of the pre-form, time is furthermore saved compared to distribution of resin over the<br>
entire ground plan.<br>
Resin systems may contain components, which may be irritant or harmful when in contact<br>
with naked skin, if ingested or inhaled. Avoidance of direct contact is therefore highly<br>
desirable. Since the products and processes according to the invention are particularly well<br>
suited for automation, the products and processes according to the invention represent a<br>
significant improvement to the working environment.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
In Fig. 1 an example of a schematic sectional view of a pre-form is shown Indicating an<br>
example of the order of the components. In a real pre-form, the distance between the<br>
layers would be much smaller and the resin and adhesive would usually be partially<br>
absorbed into the layers of fibres. Layers of oriented fibre 2 are provided with strips of<br>
adhesive 6 (see Fig. 4) at an angle - here about orthogonal - to the layers of oriented<br>
fibre tows 2. Two layers of resin 4 are also provided. The resin 4 is distributed as a<br>
number of lines (see Fig. 3) at an angle - here about orthogonal - to the layers of<br>
oriented fibre tows 2. The resin hence is distributed in a non-continuous layer to allow<br>
for gas to escape from the pre-form orthogonal to the direction of the fibre tows.<br>
In Fig. 1 the resin is provided between twp layers of fibre tows. This is the preferred<br>
positioning of resin and when this positioning is used, it is highly desirable that the<br>
resin is distributed in non-continuous layers. However, the resin may also be provided<br>
in contact with only one layer of fibre tows, i.e. in the top or at the bottom of the pre-<br>
form. In this case, it is preferred to provide the resin at the bottom of the pre-form and<br>
the resin may be provided in a continuous layer as gas will not usually have to escape<br>
through the resin layer. In a preferred embodiment, resin is only provided at top and/or<br>
the bottom of the pre-form, i.e. only adhesive is provided between the layers of fibres.<br>
In another preferred embodiment, resin is only provided at the bottom of the pre-form,<br>
i.e. between the layers of fibres only adhesive is provided.<br>
The adhesive 6 should at least partially immobilise the fibres that are provided on top<br>
of the adhesive. The adhesive may be any type of adhesive, however, the adhesive<br>
should be compatible to the resin, preferably the adhesive is a resin-type adhesive and<br>
related to the resin of the pre-form in the sense that it comprises the same type of<br>
chemistry. For example, the adhesive may comprise at least one of the components of<br>
the resin (e.g. a common epoxy component). One way to ensure compatibility between<br>
the resin and the adhesive is to use substantially the same composition. In a preferred<br>
embodiment, the composition of the adhesive is the same as the composition of the<br>
adhesive. It is within the scope of the invention to use more than one adhesive in a<br><br>
pre-form. For example some portions of adhesive may have the same composition as<br>
the resin, whereas other portions may have a different composition.<br>
Examples of preferred embodiments of geometrical ground plans 10 of pre-forms are<br>
shown in Fig. 2. The lines 2 indicate the main fibre orientation(s) of a fibre layer. Each<br>
layer of fibres typically comprises a large number (e.g. multiple millions) of fibres<br>
oriented in the main and optionally further orientations. A person skilled in the art will<br>
be able to derive a number of other geometrical ground plans without deriving from the<br>
inventive idea of the invention. Fig. 2A shows a rectangular pre-form, which may be<br>
particularly suitable for flat or cylindrical structures. Fig. 2B - Fig. 2F show pre-forms<br>
with substantially trapezoid ground plans. The angles  and  may be the same or<br>
different, however, it is preferred that these angles are substantially the same, since<br>
the pre-form may then be used for production of for example conical structures.<br>
The ratio of the distance between the parallel sides and the length of any of the<br>
parallel sides is preferably at least 3 and more preferably at least 5, since such pre-<br>
forms are particularly useful for production of long, slightly conical structures like spars<br>
for wind turbine blades. The ground plan in Fig. 2F has a ratio of about 6.<br>
Fig. 2G shows a pre-form with a triangular ground plan. Again, it is preferred that the<br>
angles  and  are substantially the same. Such a pre-form may be particularly useful<br>
for reinforcing a structure with a relatively sharp corner. The pre-form in Fig. 2H has a<br>
more irregular quadrangular ground plan. Such quadrangular ground plans may or<br>
may not have one or two angles of 90°.<br>
In Fig. 21 is an example of a layer having two main fibre orientations. Here, the fibres<br>
are mainly oriented parallel to the longer edges, however, other orientations are<br>
feasible as well as more than two main orientations. Fig. 2J shows an example of a<br>
layer having non-straight fibres. The fibres are preferably oriented to optimise the final,<br>
structure - after shaping and curing - with respect to strength and/or other properties.<br>
The fibres 2 may be provided in any desirable orientation like for example<br>
unidirectional, biaxial or random. However, the fibres should be oriented as to<br>
strengthen areas of the final structure, which will be exposed to a higher stress during<br>
service. Typically, this may be realised by orienting the fibres primarily unidirectionally<br>
and either substantially parallel to or orthogonal to an edge of the pre-form. In Fig. 2A,<br><br>
C, D, H and I the fibres are placed substantially parallel to at least one edge of the pre-form<br>
and in Fig, 2A, B, E, F, G and H the fibre tows are placed substantially orthogonal to at least<br>
one edge of the pre-form. If the ground plan has two parallel sides and the ratio of the<br>
distance between the parallel sides and the length of any of the parallel sides is very large,<br>
i.e. &gt;5, then unidirectional fibres placed between the two parallel sides may be considered<br>
to be substantially parallel to the longer edges (see e.g. Fig. 2F). Other ways of orientating<br>
the fibres may be derived by a person skilled in the art without departing from the inventive<br>
idea of the invention.<br>
The orientation of fibres may or may not be the same in all the layers of fibres ; however, in<br>
a preferred embodiment the fibres are oriented substantially the same in all the layers of<br>
fibres. When one or more layers of fibres are oriented in another way as other layers, this<br>
may for example be if the stress analysis suggests a multi-axial fibre placing, but<br>
unidirectional fibre placing is favourable for manufacturing reasons.<br>
Another way to strengthen the area of the final structure, which will be exposed to higher<br>
stress during service, is to increase the amount of fibres in these areas. An example of this<br>
is shown in Fig. 2E, where the area near the central part of the pre-form has a greater<br>
amount of fibre tows than the outer parts of the pre-form.<br>
It is preferred that the resin is provided to form a non-continuous layer or layers,<br>
even if this is not a requirement for layers of resin where gas will not escape<br>
through during a subsequent consolidation and/or curing of the pre-form. The<br>
resin may stick to and/or at least partially immobilise fibres of one or more layers. The<br>
discrete dots may for example be formed from a resin provided as a liquid. A liquid resin<br>
may also be provided as a line or several lines, which may be form an oriented pattern, a<br>
random pattern or a combined pattern. An example of an oriented pattern is shown in Fig.<br>
3A, where a resin is distributed as lines of resin 4a orthogonal to a main fibre orientation. As<br>
a variation to the distribution shown in Fig. 3A, the resin may be provided partially over the<br>
edge, i.e. the turning part of the string may be off the ground plan to provide for a more even<br>
density of resin, However, this will result in an undesired waste and should be omitted for<br>
example by controlling the flow of the resin during the applying. An example of<br>
a random pattern is shown in Fig. 3C, where a resin is distributed as curly lines. A<br><br>
different approach to a non-continuous layer of resin is shown in Fig. 3D where a<br>
sheet of resin 4d having a number of through-going holes 12 are provided. As it is<br>
obvious from these examples of resin patterns, a person skilled in the art will be able<br>
to provide other patterns without departing from the Inventive idea of the invention.<br>
The adhesive 6 may in principle be provided in the same patterns as the resin,<br>
however, it is preferred to provide a less dense pattern for the adhesive to save time.<br>
In Fig. 4 some preferred embodiments of the adhesive distribution are shown. It is<br>
important to keep in mind that the purpose of the adhesive is to ensure that the fibres<br>
are at least partially immobilised to facilitate fibre laying. Furthermore, the adhesive will<br>
often increase the mechanical strength and hence the handieability of an<br>
unconsolidated and uncured pre-form by at least partially fixing adjacent layers of fibre<br>
to each other. One way to ensure a facilitation of the fibre laying is to provide a strip of<br>
adhesive close to or exactly where the fibres are initiated during fibre laying. In Fig. 4A<br>
the direction of the fibre laying is indicated by the arrow 14. Hence, the fibres are<br>
initiated near the adhesive 6a. A preferred way to ensure a relatively good fixation of<br>
the fibres is to provide adhesive 6b near the termination of the fibres. If the adhesive<br>
6a and 6b does not provide sufficient fixation of the fibres, further adhesive 6c may be<br>
provided. In Fig. 4A the adhesive is provided as strips, however, other embodiments<br>
are also feasible like for example dots, broken or curved lines, etc. In some cases,<br>
automation may favour an adhesive pattern, where the adhesive is applied in a<br>
continuous line, for example as a zigzag pattern as shown in Fig. 4B. This is an<br>
example of a pattern where the number of adhesive initiations and terminations are<br>
reduced compared to the pattern in Fig. 4A. A person skilled in the art will appreciate<br>
the advantage of providing only a limited amount of adhesive compared to either a full<br>
or nearly full layer of resin or cross-ply stitching, particularly with respect to the time<br>
saved during processing and ease of automation.<br>
In some applications, the pre-form is intended for reinforcing structures with a non-<br>
circular cross section like for example a spar having a substantially rectangular cross<br>
section where the pre-form should be bent around a relatively sharp edge. The<br>
preferred orientation of fibres in such case is that the main fibre orientation is parallel<br>
to the edge, e.g. in the direction I-I in Fig. 5, It may then be advantageous to form at<br>
least part of the pre-form three-dimensionally to enhance shaping of the pre-form. To<br>
realise a significant outcome of a three-dimensional forming, the pre-form usually<br>
should preferably comprise at least three layers of oriented fibre tows, since if the pre-<br><br>
form consists of only two layers, the pre-form may usually be bent without three-<br>
dimensional shaping of the pre-form. The higher the number of layers, the greater the<br>
benefit from three-dimensionally forming of the pre-form. In a preferred embodiment, a<br>
pre-form is provided with two tapered sections 22 towards the edges substantially<br>
parallel to the fibre orientation as indicated in Fig. 5; however, a person skilled in the<br>
art may derive a number of variations without deriving from the inventive idea of the<br>
invention. Such variations may for example be using one, three or another number of<br>
tapered parts, using one or more steps instead of tapered parts, placing a tapered part<br>
away from an edge e.g. near the centre etc.<br>
By being formed three-dimensionally is herein meant that the thickness (e.g. the<br>
number of layers or amount of fibres and/or resin) and/or the form of the ground plan is<br>
adjusted for a part (e.g. 20, 22) of the pre-form relative to the bulk (e.g. 24) of the pre-<br>
form.<br>
Three-dimensional forming may also be applied for reducing of the interfacial stress<br>
between a pre-form and an adjacent structure. Examples of such adjacent structures<br>
are other pre-forms and parts of larger structures, e.g. a root of a blade for a wind<br>
turbine. Typically, such three-dimensional forms will involve the creation of a large<br>
contact area orthogonal to the main stress direction in at least one axis. In Fig. 5 a part<br>
20 is an example of a three-dimensional form for reducing the interfacial stress<br>
between the pre-form and an adjacent connected structure. A distance much greater<br>
than the orthogonal distance separates the terminations of the layers of fibres in the<br>
tapered section 20 as seen in the cross section along I-I in Fig. 5 and hence the<br>
interfacial stress will be reduced.<br>
A particular ground plan or three-dimensional form may for example be realised by<br>
selective initiating and/or terminating fibre tows during fibre laying.<br>
The main function of the adhesive is to immobilise the fibres as they are placed on top<br>
of the adhesive. This can be achieved by having a tacky adhesive, whereby the fibres<br>
stick to the tacky adhesive. The adhesive may be any tacky material, or a solid with a<br>
tacky surface and the adhesive may for example comprise polyester, polyurethane,<br>
epoxy or similar compounds or a combination of these. It is within the scope of the<br>
invention to use any material or combination of materials having a tacky surface<br>
including solid materials with tacky surfaces. More than one type of adhesive may be<br><br>
used within a pre-form. For example, it is within the scope of the invention to use the resin<br>
as an adhesive between the layers of fibre tows where a resin is provided or to use a second<br>
type of resin below the first layer of fibre tows.<br>
The resin may be liquid material. The resin may for example be based on unsaturated<br>
polyester, polyurethane, epoxy, or similar chemical compounds, including combinations of<br>
these.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the resin is a liquid and the resin is introduced<br>
by Resin Transfer Moulding, RTM, or Vacuum Assisted Resin Transfer Moulding, VARTM,<br>
into an entity comprising several layers of oriented fibre tows, which were previously<br>
immobilised during fibre laying by an adhesive.<br>
The resin may comprise more than one system, for example the resin may comprise two<br>
systems or even more systems. These systems may be any combination of different or the<br>
same type of systems, however, it is preferred that the resin comprises two substantially<br>
epoxy-based systems. In a preferred embodiment, two epoxy-based systems comprise a<br>
common component. The common component may for example be a common catalyst, a<br>
common amine component or a common epoxy component ; however, it is preferred that<br>
the common component is an epoxy component. A resin comprising two epoxy-based<br>
systems with a common epoxy component may comprise an amine-component of a first<br>
epoxy-based system that will react to the common epoxy component at a first relatively low<br>
temperature, like for example below 50°C, preferably about room temperature. At this first<br>
temperature, a second epoxy-based system is preferably non-reactive or the reaction takes<br>
place at a very low rate. Since the reaction rate of the second epoxy-based system should<br>
be very low, it may advantageously be catalysed by a catalyst, which is non-active until<br>
activated. This activation may for example be by UV-light, addition of a compound or by<br>
heating, however, it is preferred that the catalyst is activated by heating.<br>
In one embodiment sketched in Fig. 6, a pre-mix 36 comprises amine components 30a and<br>
30b and a catalyst 32, preferably for catalysing the curing of a second epoxy-based system.<br>
The pre-mix should be a stable solution or slurry and if the viscosity is too low to prevent<br>
precipitation of a solid component like e.g. a catalyst, a small amount of an epoxy<br>
component preferably a common epoxy component of the systems, may be added.<br><br>
Typically 0.1 to 5% by weight of epoxy should be sufficient to adjust the viscosity. The pre-<br>
mix and a common epoxy component should be mixed immediately before distribution of the<br>
resin 40. The resin may be heated to decrease the viscosity.<br>
Resins to be used according to the present invention may be prepared in most of the<br>
traditional ways familiar to a person skilled in the art and the embodiment with regard to<br>
preparation of the resin that is disclosed in Fig. 6 should be considered as an example on<br>
how a resin may be prepared. This embodiment should by no means be regarded as a<br>
limitation of the scope of the invention.<br>
Alternatively, a simple three-dimensional shape may be provided as shown, in Fig. 7, where<br>
a number of identical ground plans of oriented fibres 50 are placed on top of each other but<br>
shifted slightly. The lines shown on the ground plans 50 do not indicate the orientation of the<br>
fibre tows but are merely included to enhance distinguishing the different layers when they<br>
are combined. In the middle section of Fig. 7, the layers are placed on top of each other step<br>
by step and hence forming a pre-form in the bottom part of Fig. 7 having parts 52 with a low<br>
number of layers of fibres, parts 54 with an intermediate number of layers of fibres and a<br>
part 56 with a high number of layers of fibres. When a higher number of layers are provided,<br>
then the parts 52 and 54 may be prepared to appear almost taper-like. This method may<br>
simultaneously provide a pre-form having two, three, four or more tapered parts.<br>
The properties of a fibre-reinforced composite depend to a large extent on the<br>
properties of the fibre. However, the properties of different types of fibres vary<br>
considerably. For example, the coefficient of thermal expansion of carbon fibres is<br>
very low, and in some cases even negative. It may therefore be very difficult to<br>
connect carbon fibre-reinforced composites to composites reinforced by other types of fibres<br><br>
and a pre-form comprising carbon fibres may therefore advantageously be enhanced<br>
for coupling to a composite member comprising a second type fibres and a resin.<br>
Examples of second type fibres are glass fibres, aramid fibres, synthetic fibres (e.g.<br>
acrylic, polyester, PAN, PET, PE, PP or PBO fibres), bio fibres (e.g. hemp, jute,<br>
cellulose fibres, etc.), mineral fibres (e.g. Rockwool™), metal fibres (e.g. steel,<br>
aluminium, brass, copper etc.) or boron fibres.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the pre-form is enhanced for connecting by providing the<br>
pre-form with second type fibres. These second type fibres should extend beyond the<br>
pre-form to provide a part for connection. The second type fibres as well as the carbon<br>
fibres may be provided in interlaced layers rich in the respective fibres. For example,<br>
the layers may exclusively have only one of the type of fibres. In a preferred<br>
embodiment, the layers comprising second type fibres are provided as prepregs. The<br>
prepregs may be unidirectional prepregs, however, experimental results suggest,<br>
surprisingly, that biaxial prepregs comprising the second type fibres provide a better<br>
basis for connecting of the pre-form to a structure reinforced by second type fibres.<br>
Near the end of a layer of fibres interlaced in a material having different properties, a<br>
stress concentration will build up. To reduce or prevent coupling of stress from the<br>
ends of one layer to the ends of the next layer, the distance of the interlace should be<br>
greater that the extent of the stress concentration. Since the extent of the stress<br>
concentration is difficult to establish, it is preferred to use a safety margin and hence<br>
separate the ends of two adjacent layers by at least 2 times the extent of the stress<br>
concentration-<br>
It is also reasonable to ensure that the distance between the nearest layer end of the<br>
same type of fibre should be separated by a distance corresponding to the extent of a<br>
stress concentration, preferably with a safety margin and hence using a factor of 2.<br>
The extent of the stress concentration depends on a number of factors, like for<br>
example thickness of the layers, the type of fibres, the type of resin, etc., and may be<br>
established by modelling or by empirical methods.<br>
Pre-forms according to the invention and provided by a method according to the<br>
invention are very useful for pre-consolidation, since the escape of gas from the pre-<br>
form is facilitated by the presence of non-continuous layers of resin. The pre-forms<br><br>
may alternatively be used directly for preparation of composite members by curing.<br>
Particularly, the pre-forms are highly useful for preparation of members for wind<br>
turbine blades, since composites fulfilling the quality requirements and reproducibility<br>
requirements may be produced.<br>
When larger structures comprising pre-forms according to the invention or pre-forms<br>
produced by a method according to the invention are to be prepared, this may follow a<br>
method wherein the pre-form is shaped at least partially plastically. The pre-form may<br>
be connected to further pre-forms before or after shaping to provide a larger structure.<br>
The pre-form may also be connected to other structures. It is preferred but not<br>
required that the connections involve a tapered part or layers comprising second type<br>
fibres. The combined structure may be placed in a vacuum enclosure and provided<br>
with vacuum prior to curing. Finally, the pre-form structure is cured.<br>
Fig. 8 shows an example of a cross section of a pre-form that is enhanced for<br>
connection to a structure or other pre-forms being reinforced by a second type fibres.<br>
More thorough connections are particularly important when the physical properties of<br>
the structures to be connected differ significantly. Typically, the physical properties are<br>
to a high extent dictated by the reinforcement fibres, and examples of relevant physical<br>
properties are the coefficient of thermal expansion, CTE, and Young's modulus.<br>
Hence, these types of connections are for example relevant when a composite<br>
comprising carbon fibres are connected to a composite reinforced by another type of<br>
fibres, since the CTE of carbon fibres are very low and may even be negative.<br>
However, the same type of connections may be used for strong connections between<br>
composites reinforced by other types of fibres. The second type fibres may be any of<br>
the fibre-types mentioned previously in the description and for example this type of<br>
connection may be used for connecting a carbon fibre-reinforced composite to a glass<br>
fibre-reinforced composite. The pre-form in Fig. 8 has layers of second type fibres 62<br>
(e.g. glass fibres) interlaced between the layers of carbon fibres 60 of the bulk pre-<br>
form.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the overlay distance of the interlace 64 is greater than the<br>
extent of the end condition of the interfacial stress between layers rich in or exclusively<br>
containing carbon fibres and layers rich in or exclusively containing second type fibres,<br>
since this will prevent a coupling or build-up of stress between the interlaced layers.<br>
For the same reason and for reason of introducing a safety margin, it is more preferred<br><br>
that the distance of the interlace 64 is greater than 2 times the extent of the end condition of<br>
the interfacial stress.<br>
In another preferred embodiment, the distance 66 between the ends of the layers rich in<br>
second type fibres which are interlaced between layers rich in carbon fibres, are separated<br>
by a distance greater than the extent of the end condition of the interfacial stress between<br>
layers rich in carbon fibres and layers rich in second type fibres. Again, this is to prevent a<br>
coupling or build-up of stress between the interlaced layers. For the same reason and for<br>
reason of introducing a safety margin, it is more preferred that the distance between the<br>
ends of the layers rich in second type fibres is greater than 2 times the extent of the end<br>
condition of the interfacial stress.<br>
In a possible use of the pre-form, the pre-form is further treated by pre-consolidation to form<br>
a pre-consolidated pre-form as described in the following section. Pre-consolidation is<br>
particularly useful when the fibres are provided as fibre tows, compared to fibres provided in<br>
prepregs as a lower viscosity during the pre-consolidation process. This will increase the<br>
redistribution of resin and/or fibres, which is highly desirable as it increases the homogeneity<br>
of the resulting product.<br>
By pre-consolidation is herein meant a process, whereby gas inside a pre-form is removed<br>
and a low porosity pre-form is produced. Pre-consolidation involves redistribution of a resin<br>
and optionally a redistribution of fibres. Furthermore, pre-consolidation may involve a limited<br>
curing of the resin. Pre-consolidation is particularly useful as it produces a dense pre-form<br>
(hereinafter named a pre-consolidated pre-form). Pre-consolidated pre-forms and<br>
composites prepared from pre-consolidated pre-forms will be appreciated amongst others<br>
due to good reproducibility, low porosity, high homogeneity, high strength, ability to plastical<br>
shaping of the pre-consolidated pre-form, ability to be connected to other pre-forms and/or<br>
other structures, suitability for automation and long shelf life without premature curing.<br>
When the pre-consolidation involves a limited curing, this limited curing may involve a<br>
release of up to 50% of the energy that will be released by a complete<br>
curing of the resin. However, it is preferred that the extent of curing is limited to an extent<br>
that will allow the pre-form to be deformed plastically. The degree of curing that will allow for<br>
plastical deformation of a pre-consolidated pre-form depends amongst others on<br>
the exact resin as well as on the fibre type and fibre content. Generally, it is preferred that<br><br>
the limited curing involves less than about 20% of the energy that will be released by a<br>
complete curing of the resin and more preferably that the limited curing involves<br>
between 3 to 15% of the energy that will be released by a complete curing.<br>
Generally speaking, the pre-consolidation process should reduce the porosity of a pre-<br>
form, however, it is preferred that the resulting porosity of the pre-consolidated pre-<br>
form is less than 5% by volume, preferably less than 2% by volume and more<br>
preferably less than 1% by volume. In some cases, a porosity of even 1% may reduce<br>
the properties of a composite considerably. In these cases, it will be appreciated that<br>
the method and the pre-consolidated pre-forms may be produced with porosities well<br>
below 1%. For example, a reproduced porosity of about 0.2% by volume was realised<br>
for a composite with 60% carbon fibres in epoxy. The reduction of the porosity may for<br>
example be a result of exposing the pre-form to a pressure and/or a vacuum in relation<br>
to the pre-consolidation process.<br>
The porosity of the pre-consolidated pre-form can not be established directly, as a<br>
density is not known and may vary throughout the material. Hence, the porosity should<br>
be established by optical method on a materialographic sample. Preparation of<br>
materialographic samples from an uncured pre-consolidated pre-form is very<br>
demanding, since the material comprises both a very soft element (i.e. a resin) and a<br>
very hard element (i.e. the fibre). To establish a reproducible result, it is hence<br>
necessary to cure the pre-form prior to materialographic preparation. This curing<br>
should be pressureless to ensure that the porosity is unaffected by the process.<br>
To ensure handleability, the pre-consolidated pre-form should be substantially<br>
unsticky, i.e. it should be easily releasable from any relevant surface and it should not<br>
leave excessive amounts of resin on a surface when released.<br>
To ensure a long shelf life and/or stability during transportation it is important that the<br>
curing reaction of the bulk of the resin is sufficiently low at room temperature and that<br>
a catalyst - if present - is not activated by accident. For example, if the catalyst is<br>
activated by heating, it should be ensured that the activation temperature is<br>
considerably higher than the expected maximum temperature during storage.<br>
One of the features of the pre-consolidated pre-forms is that they are at least partially<br>
deformable. This may for example be realised through the balanced and limited curing<br><br>
during the pre-consolidation process. In a preferred embodiment, at least a part of a<br>
pre-consolidated pre-form is capable of being bent around an axis parallel to the main<br>
fibre orientation with a diameter of more than I cm, however, in some cases a pre-<br>
consolidated pre-form may be bent with a diameter of more than 5 cm by plastic<br>
deformation. The low bending diameters may be realised by rearranging of resin<br>
and/or fibres or by three-dimensional forming of a pre-form. By three-dimensional<br>
forming is herein meant that the thickness (e.g. the number of layers or amount of<br>
fibres and/or resin) and/or the form of the ground plan is adjusted for a part of the pre-<br>
form relative to the bulk of the pre-form, Typically, only a part of the pre-consolidated<br>
pre-form is prepared for very sharp bending, whereas bending around an axis with<br>
larger diameters, e.g. 50 cm, may often be realised by all parts of the pre-consolidated<br>
pre-form.<br>
The stiffness of a pre-form realised during a pre-consolidation process should ensure<br>
that the pre-consolidated pre-form is stiff enough to prevent relaxation of the pre-<br>
consolidated pre-form in the length direction of the fibres when placed on a non-flat<br>
surface and yet allow for plastic deformation around an axis parallel to the length<br>
direction of the fibres. In particular, when a pre-consolidated pre-form comprising<br>
carbon fibres is placed on crossing layers of glass fibres or glass fibre pre-pregs with<br>
partial overlay, then the pre-consolidated pre-form should remain substantially flat<br>
during laying and curing, whereas the glass fibres should adjust to the shape/form of<br>
the pre-consolidated pre-form. Hence, the carbon fibres will remain straight leading to<br>
increased strength of the combined structure.<br>
The pre-consolidation process often leads to an increase in viscosity of the resin in the<br>
pre-form, for example by a partial curing. It is preferred that the viscosity at room<br>
temperature is increased by a factor of at least two and more preferably by a factor of<br>
at least five, as an increase in viscosity will enhance handleability, strength and<br>
unstickyness. In some cases, the viscosity may be increased by a much higher factor<br>
like for example 10, 100 or 1000. This is for example the case if part of the resin is<br>
injected into the pre-form as a room temperature liquid. Another way to express the<br>
increase in viscosity is to look at viscosity directly. It is preferred that the viscosity of<br>
the resin in the unconsolidated pre-form is between about 100 to 10,000 cP at the<br>
temperature where the pre-consolidation process is conducted, preferably between<br>
about 500 to 3,000 cP.<br><br>
The temperature where the pre-consolidation process is conducted may vary<br>
considerably depending particularly on the composition of the resin. Typically, the pre-<br>
consolidation temperatures for epoxy-based resin systems are 50 to 900C and<br>
preferably 60 to 80°C, however, both higher and lower temperatures may be feasible<br>
in some systems.<br>
The pre-consolidation process may lead to an increase in the glass transition<br>
temperature, Tg, of the resin, for example by a partial curing. It is preferred that the Tg<br>
of the resin is increased during pre-consolidation by at least 2°C and preferably by at<br>
least 5°C, as an increase in Tg usually indicates an increase in the average molecular<br>
weight of the resin, which will enhance handleability, strength and unstickyness. In<br>
some cases, Tg may be increased more. This is particularly the case when Tg of the<br>
unconsolidated pre-form is very low.<br>
Generally speaking, a pre-consolidated pre-form according to the invention with an<br>
epoxy-based resin system should typically have a Tg between -10 to +30°C and<br>
preferably a Tg between -5 to 10°C. In a preferred embodiment, Tg of the resin of the<br>
pre-consolidated pre-form is higher than about 0°C and preferably higher than about<br>
3°C. For the unconsolidated pre-form Tg of the resin should be below about 5°C and<br>
preferably below about 2°C.<br>
In some cases, curing of a pre-consolidated pre-form without being exposed to a<br>
vacuum will result in a material with properties equivalent to a vacuum-cured pre-form,<br>
since porosity has been eliminated or greatly reduced during the pre-consolidation<br>
process prior to the curing.<br>
The resin may comprise more than one system, for example the resin may comprise<br>
two systems. These systems may be any combination of different or the same type of<br>
systems, however, it is preferred that the resin comprises two substantially epoxy-<br>
based systems. The systems of a resin should be compatible. In a preferred<br>
embodiment, two epoxy-based systems comprise a common component. The<br>
common component may for example be a common catalyst, a common amine<br>
component or a common epoxy component, however, it is preferred that the common<br>
component is an epoxy component. A resin comprising two epoxy-based systems with<br>
a common epoxy component may comprise an amine component of a first epoxy-<br>
 based system that will react to the common epoxy component at a first relatively low<br><br>
temperature like for example below 50°C, preferably about room temperature. At this<br>
first temperature, a second epoxy-based system is preferably non-reactive or the<br>
reaction takes place at a very low rate. Since the reaction rate of the second epoxy-<br>
based system should be very low, it may advantageously be catalysed by a catalyst,<br>
which is un-active until activated. This activation may for example be by UV-light,<br>
addition of a compound or by heating, however, it is preferred that the catalyst is<br>
activated by heating.<br>
In a preferred method of pre-consolidating a pre-form, a pre-form is placed on a<br>
reactor surface like for example a plate, a mould, etc. It is preferred that the reactor<br>
surface is flat and that it will withstand heating and/or vacuum. Then a pressure is<br>
applied to the pre-form. The pressure may be applied by a press or - preferably - a<br>
vacuum within a vacuum enclosure. If a vacuum is used, then a vacuum enclosure<br>
should be obtained prior to pressing. The vacuum enclosure may for example<br>
comprise a vacuum bag or it may comprise a reactor surface and a flexible cover<br>
connected in a vacuum-tight way to the reactor surface. Gas may for example be<br>
evacuated through the reactor surface or through an opening in the vacuum bag or<br>
flexible cover. The pre-consolidation is activated. The activation may take place before<br>
and/or during and/or after applying of pressure. The activation comprises a reduction<br>
of the viscosity of the resin. This may for example be realised by physical means (e.g..<br>
heating, addition of solvent, pressure etc.) and/or by a chemical reaction. During the<br>
pre-consolidation process, a limited curing may or may not take place. When the<br>
porosity has been reduced to a desired level or another object of the pre-consolidation<br>
is obtained, the pre-consolidation process is terminated. The termination may for<br>
example be a result of exhaustion of a first resin system or cooling of the pre-<br>
consolidated pre-form to a temperature, where the curing reaction is sufficiently slow<br>
and/or the viscosity is sufficiently low for the pre-consolidated pre-form to achieve the<br>
stability needed for the desired shelf life.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the pre-form to be pre-consolidated is having at least one<br>
non-continuous layer of resin, through which gas may be removed during the pre-<br>
consolidation process. Hence, the gas need not be removed from the pre-form in a<br>
plane of a layer of resin or in a plane of a layer of fibres. The transportation distance<br>
and risk of having trapped gas inside the pre-consolidated pre-form is greatly reduced.<br>
In a more preferred embodiment, ail layers of resin - optionally except from a layer on<br>
top of the top layer of fibres or below the bottom layer of fibres - are non-continuous.<br><br>
The extent of redistribution depends i.a. on the viscosity of the resin during the<br>
compaction process, i.e. the lower the viscosity, the easier the redistribution of the<br>
elements. By utilising a pre-consolidation process the viscosity of the resin may be<br>
lowered more than what is feasible in the prior art, since the structure is not limited to<br>
support a particular shape during the process. When the pre-consolidation involves a<br>
limited curing of the resin, the viscosity may be further reduced since the curing<br>
increases the handleability and reduces the sticking of the pre-consolidated pre-form.<br>
Hence, pre-consolidation allows for redistribution of resin and/or fibres to a much<br>
greater extent than what may be realised in the prior art. The resulting pre-<br>
consolidated pre-forms may possess very low porosity as well as a more<br>
homogeneous structure. This may for example result in a composite structure having a<br>
less pronounced laminar structure, i.e. where the layers are less pronounced than a<br>
corresponding composite structure comprising only pre-forms that were not pre-<br>
consolidated prior to curing.<br><br>
An example of a method for securing that gas may continuously be removed from the<br>
pre-form during pre-consolidation involves a gradual activation of the pre-consolidation<br>
process starting either from the centre of the pre-form and moving towards the<br>
surfaces or from a side or edge and moving through the pre-form. For example this<br>
may be realised by heating from the reaction surface only, hence activating gradually<br>
from the side of the pre-form in contact with the reaction surface or by controlled<br>
microwave heating, hence activating gradually from the inside of the pre-form and<br>
moving towards the surfaces.<br>
Pre-forms according to the invention and provided by a method according to the<br>
invention are very useful for preparation of composite members by curing. Particularly,<br>
the pre-forms are highly useful for preparation of members for wind turbine blades and<br>
particularly in spars in a wind turbine blade, since these composites fulfil the quality<br>
requirements and reproducibility requirements.<br>
When larger structures comprising pre-forms according to the invention or pre-forms<br>
produced by a method according to the invention are to be prepared, this may follow a<br>
method wherein the pre-form is shaped at least partially plastically. The pre-form may<br>
be connected to one or more further pre-consolidated pre-forms and/or unconsolidated<br>
pre-forms before or after shaping to provide a larger structure. The pre-form may also<br>
be connected to other structures. It is preferred but not required that the connections<br>
involve a tapered part or layers comprising a second type of fibres. The combined<br>
structure may be placed in a vacuum enclosure and provided with vacuum prior to<br>
curing. Finally, the pre-form structure is cured.<br>
The properties of a laminar structure having layers of oriented fibres depend to a large<br>
extent on the distribution of the main elements of the structure resin, fibres and<br>
porosity. The resin possesses a low strength compared to the fibres and may hence<br>
provide a route for crack propagation through the structure, if too large layers of resin<br>
are present. Porosity may reduce the strength of the structure dramatically but the<br>
adversity depends on the size of pores, the shape and the distribution, i.e. the effect of<br>
small, isolated spherical pores is limited, whereas larger pores positioned in the<br>
interface between resin and fibres may be fatal to the structure. It is hence vital to be<br>
able to control the distribution of the elements.<br><br>
