THE PATENTS RULES, 2003<br>
COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10]<br>
"BODY STRUCTURE OF A MOTORCYCLE"<br>
HONDA GIKEN KOGYO KABUSHIKI KAISHA, a corporation of Japan, having a place of business at 1-1, Minamiaoyama 2-chome, Minato-ku, Tokyo, Japan<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br>
25-04-2006<br><br><br>
[Industrial Field of the Invention]<br>
The present invention relates generally to body structure of a motorcycle and more particularly to body structure which can be made thinner, and reduced in size and weight.<br>
[Description of the Related Art] As one of body frame structure of motorcycles, diamond-type frame structure utilizing an engine as part of<br><br>
a body frame is known. Among such frame structure, one of backbone types having one main frame disposed in a longitudinal direction of a body frame above an engine comprises: the main frame; a pair of right and left pivot plates welded to the rear end of the main frame and disposed so as to extend generally vertically; a pair of right and left seat rails extending backward from a rear part of the main frame; and lower frames disposed under the seat rails and obliquely connecting the seat rails to the pivot plates. Further, a rear arm is connected to a middle part of each cff the pivot plates, and lower ends thereof serve as an engine-hanging part and a stand supporting part (see Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 10-29582, for example).<br><br>
[Problems to be Solved by the Invention] When adopting pivot plate structure such as the one described above, a pair of pivot plates serves as a pivot unit for the rear arm, a connection with the lower frames, and an engine hanger as well as the stand supporting part. Therefore, the pivot plates have to be highly rigid and are sometimes formed by casting or forging. However, when manufactured in such a way, the pivot plates get larger and heavier, and their costs are to be raised in the end. Further, the connection between each of the pivot plates and the main frame, etc. requires a long effective length for weld, and it has to be reinforced with a plurality of patches. These are the factors that made the body frame larger, heavier and more expensive.  Thus, it<br>
3<br><br>
is desired to make the body frame more compact, lighter and less expensive by altering the frame structure including the pivot plates. The object of the present invention is to meet such demands.<br>
[0004]<br>
[Means for Solving the Problems]<br>
For the purpose of solving the above problems, the<br>
invention according to claims 1 is body structure of a motorcycle comprising a mains frame disposed above an engine<br>
and in a longitudinal direction of a body, a rear arm supported on a rear part of the main frame for supporting a rear wheel, seat rails extending from the rear pjart.of the main frame toward the rear of the body while passing under a seat, and lower frames disposed under the seat rails and connecting the main frame to the seat rails; wherein each front end of said lower frames extends downward beyond the rear end of the main frame to form a downward extension, and an engine-hanging part is provided on the downward extension.<br>
[0005]<br>
The invention according to claim 2 is the body structure of a motorcycle of the claim 1, wherein said downward extension is provided with a stand supporting part supporting at least either a side stand or a main stand.<br>
[0006]<br>
The invention according to claim 3 is the body structure of a motorcycle, wherein said downward extension is provided with an engine hanger according to the claim 1 and the stand<br><br>
supporting part according to the claim 2.<br>
[0007]<br>
The invention according to claim 4 is the body structure of a motorcycle of the claim 3, wherein said engine hanger and the stand supporting part are integrally formed as a single member.<br>
[0008]<br>
The invention according to claim 5 is the body structure of a motorcycle of the claim 1 or 2, wherein said main frame comprises a pair of right and left main members and a pivot unit formed separately from the main members, the upper part of the pivot unit is caught between, and connected to, the rear ends of said right and left main members, and the lower part of the pivot unit is connected to said lower frames.<br>
[0009]<br>
The invention according to claim 6 is the body structure of a motorcycle of the claim 5 , wherein an air cleaner is disposed in the rear of the body with respect to said pivot unit, as seen from either side of the body, a carburetor is disposed in the front of the body, and a connecting tube connecting the air cleaner to the carburetor is disposed so as to extend through the space among the top of the pivot unit and the right and left main members.<br>
[0010]<br>
[Effects of the Invention]<br>
In the invention according to claims 1 through 3, each front end of the lower frames is extended downward beyond the<br>
5<br><br>
main frame to form the downward extension so that either the engine hanger or the stand supporting part, or both of them can be provided making use of the downward extension. Accordingly, since the conventional large and heavy pivot plates are eliminated, a compact and lighter body frame can be achieved and reduction in its cost is made possible. [0011]<br>
Also, as shown in the invention according to claim 4, the engine hanger and the stand supporting part can be integrally formed as a relatively compact single component. [0012]<br>
According to claim 5, since the main frame comprises the pair of right and left main members and one pivot unit whose upper part is caught between, and connected to, the rear ends of the main members, the pivot unit can be more compact and its size in the direction of a vehicle width can be smaller than conventional pivot plates. [0013]<br>
Further, according to claim 6, the carburetor and the air cleaner are disposed in front of and behind the pivot unit, and the connecting tube can be provided by making use of the space among the top of the pivot unit and the right and left main members .<br><br><br><br><br>

The fuel tank 85 is supported on the right and left seat rails 6, and the seat 27 is disposed on the fuel tank 85 so as to be openable and closable.<br>
[0046]<br>
A secondary-air control valve 86 for controlling<br>
19<br><br>
secondary air supplied to an exhaust system is disposed in front of the carburetor 83, between the right and left main members 10, and connected to the cylinder head 7 0 through a tube 87 and to the clean side of the air cleaner 80 through a tube 88. The tube 87 is supported by a stay 33.<br>
[0047]<br>
Further, a sub-air cleaner 90 is disposed in the middle space between the front ends of the right and left main members, and is connected to the carburetor 83 through piping 91. Also, a blowby gas hose 92 extends from the central portion of the upper surface of the rear of the crankcase 71 to the right side of the body. The hose is further disposed so that it passes by the side of the main member 10 to be connected to the front of the clean side of the air cleaner 80, avoiding the the-rmal effect from the engine 3.<br>
[0048]<br>
Also, as shown in Figs. 1 and 2, a portion lower than a rear cowl 24 of the air cleaner 80 and the side of the pivot unit 11 are covered with a pivot cover 19. The pivot cover 19 is a generally Y-shaped member, as viewed from either side of the body, and is made of an appropriate material such as a resin. Further, the pivot cover 19 overlaps the outside of a footrest holder 74, and its central portion is fastened together with the engine 3 against the footrest holder 74 and the pivot unit 11. Also, an upper portion of the pivot cover 19 extends along a lower end of the rear cowl 24, and its front portion is mounted on a stay 65 provided at the rear end of<br>
20<br><br>
the main member 10.<br>
[0049]<br>
The reference numeral 93 in Fig. 3 designates a radiator reserve tank, which is provided using space formed between the seat rail 6 on the left side of the body and the lower frame 7, and a portion of the reserve tank overlaps a fuel tank 85 as seen from either side of the body. The reference numeral 8 designates an exhaust pipe, which extends from the front of a cylinder head 70 and proceeds backward, passing under the crankcase 71 to be connected to a muffler 9. The muffler 9 extends, as shown in Fig. 2, outwardly of the right side of the body, overlaps the right side of a rear wheel 2 and further extends downwardly of the pillion footrest 60.<br>
[0050]<br>
An operation of the present embodiment will now be described. As shown in Figs. 4, 8 and 9, etc., the front end of a handlebar 17 is extended further below the lower end of the pivot unit 11 to form the downward extension 12, on which the support 43 comprising the engine-hanging part 44 and the main stand-supporting part 45, and the side stand-supporting part 47 are provided. Therefore, unlike the one in the prior art, the pivot unit 11 doesn't directly receive heavy loads placed on the support 43 and the side stand-supporting part 47. Accordingly, the required rigidity can be reduced as much, thereby enabling the pivot unit 11 to be compact, lighter, and smaller in size in the direction of the vehicle width.  In<br>
particular, if the pivot unit 11 is formed by press molding,<br><br>
21-<br><br>
its cost can be considerably reduced.<br>
[0051]<br>
Further, the support 43 and the side stand-supporting part 47 receiving heavy loads from the engine 3, the side stand 28 and the main stand 29, etc. utilize rigidity of the downward extension 12, which is a rectangular pipe. Therefore, each of them becomes compact and lighter, and can be molded easily by press molding, etc., which reduces respective cost as well. Further, the engine-hanging part 44 and the main stand-supporting part 45 are integrally formed as the support 43. Since they are formed as a single piece, the number of parts can be reduced, facilitating the production. Thus, the whole body frame 4 can be compact and lighter, enabling the body to be thinner and reducing the cost thereof.<br>
[0052]<br>
The carburetor 83 and the air cleaner 80 are separately positioned in front and behind of the pivot unit 11, which is formed as a single piece and the back side is covered with the back wall 38. Nevertheless, the piping is arranged smoothly such that the connecting tube 82 is extended above the air cleaner 80 to the front thereof and the space produced between the upper end of the pivot unit 11 and the rear ends of right and left main members 10 is utilized.<br>
[0053]<br>
The engine 3 is of four-cycle type. Therefore, when the carburetor 83 is located in a relatively high position between the right and left main members 10, the piping of the previously<br>
22<br><br>
described connecting tube 82 extending from above the air cleaner 80 is more advantageous for such arrangement. Thus, location of each of those parts becomes suitable for the four-cycle engine. [0054]<br>
Further, the present invention is not limited to the above embodiment, and various changes and modifications may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. For example, the pivot unit 11 can be formed integrally with the main members 10. Also, the pivot 13 in the pivot unit 11 can be omitted, and a pivot unit of the rear arm 14 can be provided at the back of the crankcase 71.<br>
[0055]<br>
Further, the pivot unit 11, the support 43 and the side stand- supporting part 47 can be molded not only by press molding but also by appropriate methods such as casting and forging using aluminum alloy, etc. Also, in the above embodiment, the engine-hanging part 44 and the main stand-supporting part 45 are formed as the support 43 integrating two of them. However, the combination of the engine-hanging part 44 and the stand supporting part to be integrated is not limited, and it is possible either to integrate the engine-hanging part 44 and the side stand-supporting part 47 or to integrate both the side stand-supporting part 47 and the main stand-supporting part 45 with the engine-hanging part 44. In the latter case, the support 43 alone has three functions of the engine-hanging unit, the side stand-supporting part and the main stand-supporting<br>
