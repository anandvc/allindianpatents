				<td>FIELD OF APPLICATION<br>
The present invention relates to an improved running gear system for efficient<br>
movement of freight cars (railway wagons) on rail tracks.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
In the context of a freight car or railway wagon, a running gear system in its<br>
simplest form is a roller or its improved version, a pair of wheels and an axle, as<br>
shown respectively in Figures 1A and 1B This can be further improved with<br>
lubrication between contacts as shown in Figure 1C, bushes and bearing surface<br>
between contacts, several types of mechanical, metallic, non metallic ball,<br>
cylindrical, taper roller bearings of the most recent products between contacts as<br>
shown in Figure 1D. Still more efficient application of provision of suspension of<br>
springs of various types of steel, rubber polymer, polyurethane, steel to non<br>
metallic composites, with or without bonding, hydraulically, pneumatically and /<br>
or mechanically clamped for a ultimate smoothness and comfort of running as in<br>
Figure 1E when the system is applied to a mechanical vehicle assembly.<br>
 <br>
-3-<br>
As improvements are added the self weight of a wheel increases and the ability<br>
to carry load and the speed to move the load decreases. Keeping the above<br>
points in view it can be indicated that the most efficient running gear system is<br>
the one which is lowest in its self weight but can take up an optimized heaviest<br>
load and enable comfortable movement at as high a speed as possible.<br>
The most common freight car known at present consists of a container, covered,<br>
or open placed over pair of bogie frame (or truck frame in American term) each<br>
bogie frame being arranged on a pair of wheelsets, This is illustrated in Figure<br>
2.<br>
The load borne by the wheelsets of a freight car or railway wagon is termed as<br>
'axle load'. This load is borne by the track carrying the wheelsets as such or<br>
assembled in bogie (truck) frames and the vehicle as shown in Figure 2.<br>
 <br>
-4-<br>
From Figure 2 it can be seen that the track reaction i.e. total load on the track is<br>
the sum of pay load (called pay load because of its revenue earning capacity),<br>
superstructure weight, bogie frame weights and weight of wheelsets.<br>
Total load on the track which is also same as the axle load multiplied by the<br>
number of axles (4 axles at present), is termed as gross load on rails (track).<br>
In Indian Railway the most efficient open box type BOXN wagons meant for<br>
carrying coal and iron ore haVE a volume of about 56.29 m3. Details of these<br>
wagons are shown in Table 1 and illustrated in Figure 3.<br>
 <br>
-5-<br>
TABLE 1<br>
<br>
No. of Axle	4<br>
Axle Loads	20.321<br>
Empty Vehicle weight	23.1t<br>
Pay Loads	58.18 t<br>
Gross Load	81.28 t<br>
Pay load carrying per axle	14.545 t<br>
Wagon height	3233 mm<br>
No. of Wagon in a Train	58<br>
Pay load carrying per train(iron ore basis)	3374 t<br>
Empty train load	1339.8 t<br>
 <br>
-6-<br>
This volume of 56,29 m3 can hold more than 100 t of iron ore loading. This will<br>
make the total load on rails 121.72 t which is higher than the axle load capacity<br>
of 81.28 t (i.e. 4 x 20.32 t) as may be seen from Table 1.<br>
However, the freight carrying capacity of BOXN wagons is limited by axle loads<br>
of 20.32 t in most of the regions and in some regions, 22.9 t and 25 t. The latter<br>
two axle load limits are on a very small percentage of freight carrying routes on<br>
the Indian Railways.<br>
Increasing the axle load limits is a marathon task needing enormous amount of<br>
funds. Many years of time will be taken to complete such an up-gradation. The<br>
wastage and scrapping of existing track materials is another point worth serious<br>
consideration.<br>
The high axle load freight corridor shall be aiming at very high axle load tracks<br>
and vehicles to suit. This project may have a time element of not less than 5 to<br>
7 years to commence, completion of the same for the entire country shall be in<br>
terms of decades.<br>
 <br>
-7-<br>
There is therefore, a need to address the problem from another angle in a more<br>
realistic and cost effective way.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide an improved efficiently<br>
and effectively designed freight car or railway wagon for improving the axle load<br>
capacity.<br>
This and other objects of the present invention can be achieved by iadding two<br>
more wheelsets, if using six wheelsets in place of four wheelsets. Details of such<br>
an improved design are given in Table 2 and illustrated in Figure 4.<br>
 <br>
-8-<br>
TABLE 2<br>
<br>
No. of Axle	6<br>
Axle Loads	20.32 t<br>
Empty Vehicle weight	29.5 t<br>
Pay Loads	92.42 t<br>
Gross Load	121.92 t<br>
Pay load carrying per axle	15.40 t<br>
Wagon height	3233 mm<br>
No. of Wagon in a Train	58<br>
Pay load carrying per train(iron ore basis)	5360 t<br>
Empty train load	1711.0 t<br>
 <br>
-9-<br>
By increasing the axle loads of 4 wheelsets to that of 6 wheelsets, for nominal<br>
increase in the empty train load of 27.7 % only, the revenue earning payload can<br>
be increased by 58.86 %.<br>
This can be achieved by using the existing superstructure, 6 existing wheelsets,<br>
and two 3 axle running gear frames which can be effectively and efficiently<br>
designed.<br>
Alternatively a highly efficient new design super structure of low weight with 6<br>
existing wheelsets, and two 3-axle running gear frames of the present invention<br>
can be effectively and efficiently designed.<br>
The 3-axle frame for the efficient running gear system for freight cars of the<br>
present invention are illustrated in Figures 5 and 6.<br>
 <br>
-10-<br>
Figures 5 and 6 respectively show the 3-axle frame with steel cast elements and<br>
with fabricated all welded frame structure elements.<br>
With the improved running gear system of the present invention a 58.86 %<br>
increase in pay loads per train can be achieved for a nominal 27.72 % increase<br>
in the empty train load, while using all existing railway tracks. The pay load<br>
carried by the 20.32 t wheelset increases by 6.01 %. This is the best possible<br>
improvement in freight carrying capacity increase with the least, investment only<br>
by using additional wheelsets and running grear frames arrangement. Time<br>
required for upgradation is also the lowest.<br>
Table 3 shows some of the improved features of the freight car of the present<br>
invention compared to the existing types.<br>
