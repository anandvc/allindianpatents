				<td>This invention relates to triazolopyridinylsulfanyl derivatives. More particularly, this invention relates to pyrazo!yl-[(triazolopyridinylsulfanyl)-benzyl]-urea derivatives and to processes for the preparation of, intermediates used in the preparation of, compositions containing and the uses of, such derivatives.<br>
The triazolopyridinylsulfanyl derivatives of the present invention are inhibitors of p38 mitogen activated protein kinase ("p38 MARK", "p38 kinase" or "p38"), particularly p38α kinase, and are inhibitors of tumor necrosis factor {TNP) production, particularly TNFα. They have a number of therapeutic applications, particularly in the treatment of allergic and non-aliergic airways diseases, more particularly obstructive or inflammatory airways diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ("COPD").<br>
Mitogen activated protein kinases (MAP) constitute a famiiy of proline-directed serine/threonine kinases that activate their substrates by dual phosphorylation. The kinases are activated by a variety of signals, including nutritional and osmotic stress, UV light, growth factors, endotoxin, and inflammatory cytokines. The p38 MAP kinase group is a MAP family of various isoforms, including p38α, p38ß, and p38Y. These kinases are responsible for phosphoryJating and activating transcription factors (e.g., ATF2, CHOP, and MEF2C), as well as other kinases {e.g., MAPKAP-2 and MAPKAP-3). The p38 isoforms are activated by bacterial lipopolysaccharlde, physical and chemical stress, and pro-inflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor (TNF') and interleukin-1 ("IL-1"). The products of the p38 phosphorylation mediate the production of inflammatory cytokines, including TNF.<br>
TNF is a cytokine produced primarily by activated monocytes and macrophages. Excessive or unregulated TNF production (particularly TNF-α) has been implicated in mediating a number of diseases, and it is believed that TNF can cause or contribute to the effects of inflammation in general.<br>
IL-8 is another pro-inflammatory cytokine, which is produced by mononuclear cells, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, and keratinocytes. This cytokine Is associated with conditions including inflammation. IL-1 is produced by activated monocytes and macrophages, and is involved in Inflammatory responses. IL-1 plays a role in many pathophysiological responses, including rheumatoid arthritis, fever, and reduction of bone resorption.<br>
TNF, IL-1, and IL-8 affect a wide variety of cells and tissues, and are important inflammatory mediators of a wide variety of conditions. Compounds which inhibit p38 kinase will inhibit IL-1, IL-8, and TNF synthesis in human monocytes.<br>
P38 kinase inhibitors are W6ll known to the person skilled in the art. J. Med. Chem, 2002, 45, 2994-3008 discloses certain pyrazole urea compounds as Inhibitors of p38 kinase. International patent application <br>
PCT/1B02/00424 (WO 02/072579) discloses triazolopyridines as inhibitors of MAP kinases, preferably p38 kinase,<br>
International patent application PCT JB2004/000363 (WO 2004/072072), publication date 26th August 2004, discloses triazolo-pyridines useful as anti-inflammatory compounds for treating certain diseases. This is incorporated by reference in its entirety.<br>
The compounds of the present invention are potentially useful in the treatment of a wide range of disorders. In addition to the treatment of obstructive or inflammatory airways diseases, it is believed that the compounds of the present invention can be used to treat TNF/p38 mediated diseases such as: asthma, chronic or acute bronchoconstriction, bronchitis, acute lung injury and bronchiectasis, inflammation generally (e.g. inflammatory bowel disease), arthritis, neuroinflammation, pain, fever, fibrotic diseases, pulmonary disorders and diseases (e.g., hyperoxic alveolar injury), cardiovascular diseases, post-ischemic reperfusion injury and congestive heart failure, cardiomyopathy, stroke, ischemia, reperfusion injury, renal reperfusion Injury, brain edema, neurotrauma and brain trauma, neurodegenerative disorders, central nervous system disorders, liver disease and nephritis, gastrointestinal conditions, ulcerative diseases, ophthalmic diseases, ophthalmological conditions, glaucoma, acute injury to the eye tissue and ocular traumas, diabetes, dfabetic nephrtipathy, skin-related conditions, myalgias due to Infection, influenza, endotoxic shock, toxic shock syndrome, autoimmune disease, graft rejection, bone resorption diseases, multiple sclerosis, psoriasis, disorders of the female reproductive system, pathological (but non-malignant) conditions, such as hemaglnomas, angiofibroma of the nasopharynx, and avascular necrosis of bone, benign and malignant tumors/neoplasia including cancer, leukaemia, lymphorna, systemic lupus erthrematosis (SUE), angiogenesis including neoplasia, hemorrhage, coagulation, radiation damage, and/or metastasis. Chronic release of active TNF can cause cachexla and anorexia, and TNF can be lethal.<br>
TNF has also been implicated in infectious diseases. These include, for example, malaria, mycobacterial infection and meningitis. These also include viral infections, such as HIV, influenza virus, and herpes virus, including herpes simplex virus type-1 (HSV-1), herpes simplex virus type-2 (HSV-2), cytomegalovirus (CMV), varicella-zoster virus (VZV), Epstein-Barr virus, human herpesvirus-6 (HHV-6), human herpesvirus-7 (HHV-7), human herpesvirus-8 (HHV-8), pseudorabies and rhinotracheitis, among others.<br>
The treatment of obstructive or inflammatory airways diseases is a preferred use. All forms of obstructive or inflammatory airways diseases are potentially treatable with the compounds of the present invention, in particular an obstructive or inflammatory airways disease that is a member selected from the group consisting of chronic eosinophilic pneumonia, COPD, COPD that includes chronic bronchitis, pulmonary emphysema or dyspnea associated or not associated with COPD, COPD that is characterized by irreversible, progressive airways obstruction, adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), exacerbation of<br><br>
airways hyper-reactivity consequent to other drug therapy and airways disease that is associated with pulmonary hypertension.<br>
There is a need to provide new TNF inhibitors/p38 kinase inhibitors that are good drug candidates. Preferably, the new TNF inhibitors/ p38 kinase inhibitors show good potency, high levels of selectivity over other related protein kinases, have properties particularly suitable for providing effective treatment via the inhalation route, are suitable for the treatment of allergic and non-allergic airways diseases (particularly obstructive or inflammatory airways diseases), are non-toxic and demonstrate few side-effects, have physical properties suitable for administration by inhalation, exist in a physical form that is stable and non-hygroscopic, and/or are easily formulated.<br>

For a review on suitable salts, see Handbook of Pharmaceutical Salts: Properties. Selection, and Use by Stahl and Wermuth (Wiley-VCH, Weinheim, Germany, 2002).<br>
Pharmaceutically acceptable salts of compounds of formula (I) may be prepared by one or more of three methods:<br>
(i)        by reacting the compound of formula (I) with the desired acid or base;<br><br>
 (ii) by removing an acid- or base-labile protecting group from a suitable precursor of. the compound of formula (I) or by ring-opening a suitable cyclic precursor, for example, a lactone or lactam, using the desired acid or base; or<br>
(iii) by converting one salt of the compound of formula (I) to another by reaction with an appropriate acid or base1 or by means of a suitable ion exchange column.<br>
All three reactions are typically carried out in solution. The resulting salt may precipitate out and be collected by filtration or may be recovered by evaporation of the solvent The degree of ionisatlon in the resulting salt may vary from completely ionised to almost non-ionised.<br>
The compounds of the invention may exist In both unsolvated and solvated forms. The term 'solvate1 is used herein to describe a molecular complex comprising the compound of the invention and a<br>
stoichfometric amount of one or more pharmaceutically acceptable solvent molecules, for example, ethanol. The term 'hydrate' is employed when said solvent is water.<br>
Included within the scops of the invention are complexes such as clathrates,. drug-host Inclusion complexes wherein, in .contrast to the aforementioned solvates, the drug and host are present in stoichiometric or non-stoichiometric amounts. Also included are complexes of the drug containing two or more organic and/or inorganic components which may be in stoichiometric or non-stoichiometric amounts. The resulting complexes may ba ionised, partially ionised, or non-Ionised. For a review of such complexes, see J Pharm Sci, g4 (8). 1269-1288, by Haiebliart (August 1975).<br>
r<br>
Hereinafter all references to compounds of formula (I) Include references to salts, solvates, hydrates and complexes thereof and to solvates and complexes of salts thereof.<br>
The compounds of the invention include compounds of formula (I) as hereinbefore defined, including all polymorphs and crystal habits thereof, prodrug's and isomers thereof (including optical, geometric and tautomeric Isomers) as hereinafter defined and isotopically-labeled compounds of formula {I).<br>
As indicated, so-called 'pro-drugs' of the compounds of formula (I) are also within the scope of the inventfon. Thus certain derivatives of compounds of formula (I) which may have little or no pharmacological activity themselves can, when administered into or onto the body, be converted into compounds of formula (I) having the desired activity, for example, by;hydro!ytic cleavage. Such derivatives are referred to as 'prodrugs1. Further information on the use of prodrugs may be found in Pro-drugs as Novel Delivery Systems. Vol. 14, ACS Symposium Series (T, Higuchi and W. Stella) and BiorBverslble Carriers in Drug Design. Pergamon Press, 1987 (ed. E. B. Roche, American Pharmaceutical Association).<br><br>
Prodrugs in accordance with the invention can, for example, be produced by replacing appropriate functionalities present in the compounds of formula (I) with certain moieties known to those skilled in the art as 'pro-moieties' as described, for example, in Design of Pcodruas by H. Bundgaard (Elsevier, 1985).<br>
Some examples of prodrugs in accordance with ths invention include<br>
(i)         where the compound of formula 1 contains a carboxylic acid functionality<br>
(-COOH), an ester thereof, for example, a compound wherein the hydrogen of the carboxylic acid functionality of the compound of formula (I) is replaced by (d-CB)alkyl;<br>
(ii) where the compound of formula (I) contains an alcohol functionality (-OH), an ether thereof, for example, a compound wherein the hydrogen of the alcohol functionality of the compound of formula (I) is replaced by (CVC^alkanoyloxymethyl; and<br>
(iii) where the compound of formula (I) contains a primary or secondary amino functionality {-Nhfe or -NHR where R # H), an amide thereof, for example, a compound wherein, as the case may be, one or both hydrogens of the amino functionality of the compound of formula (I) is/are replaced by (Ci-Cto)alkanoyl.<br>
Further examples of replacement groups in accordance with the foregoing examples and examples of other prodrug types may be found in the aforementioned references.<br>
Moreover, certain compounds of formula (I) may themselves act as prodrugs of other compounds of formula (I)-<br>
Also included within the scope of the invention are metabolites of compounds of formula (I), that is, compounds formed in vivo upon administration of the drug. Some examples of metabolites in accordance with the invention include<br>
(i) where the compound of formula (I) contains a (d-C6)alkyl group, the hydroxytd-CeJalkyl derivative thereof. For example where the compound of formula (I) contains a methyl group, the hydroxymethyl derivative thereof {-CHa -&gt; -CH2OH);<br>
(it) where the compound of formula (I) contains an alkoxy group, an hydroxy derivative thereof (-OR -&gt; •OH);<br>
(iii) where the compound of formula (I) contains a tertiary amino group, a secondary amino derivative thereof (-NRSR6 -&gt; -NHRS or -NHR6);<br><br>
 (iv) where the compound of formula (I) contains a secondary amino group, a primary derivative thereof (-NHR5-&gt;-NH2);<br>
(v) where the compound of formula (I) contains a phenyl moiety, a phenol derivative thereof (-Ph -&gt; -PhOH);<br>
(vi) where the compound of formula (I) contains an amide group, a carboxylic acid derivative thereof (-CONH2-&gt; COOH); and<br>
(vii) where the compound of formula (1) contains a S-(d-C6)alkyl group, the S(O)(d-CB)alkyl derivative thereof. For example, where the compound of formula (I) contains a S-methyl group, the S(O)methyl derivative thereof, and where the compound of formula (f) contains an alkyl-S-alkyl group, the alkyl-S(O)-alky) derivative thereof.<br>
In another aspect of the invention there is provided the active metabolites of the compounds of formula (I), wherein "active" means having an \CK (TNFa screen) of less than 1000nM, and preferably an ICjo (TNFa screen) of less than 100nM. Preferably, there is provided a compound of formula (1) which contains a S(O)(Ci-Ce)alkyl group, or a hydroxy group.<br>
Compounds of formula (I) containing one or more asymmetric carbon atoms can exist as two or more stereolsomers. Where structural isomers are interconvertible via a low energy barrier,. tautomeric isomerism (tautomerism1) can occur. This can take the form of proton tautomerism in compounds of formula (I) containing, for example, an imino, keto, or oxime group, or so-called valence tautomerism in compounds which contain an aromatic moiety. It follows that a single compound may exhibit more than one type of isomerism.<br>
Included within the scope of the present invention are all stereoisomers, geometric isomers and tautomeric forms of the compounds of formula (I), including, compounds exhibiting more than one type of isomerisrn, and mixtures of one or more thereof. Also included are acid addition or base salts wherein the counterion is optically active, for example, d-laciate or l-lysine, or racemic, for example, dl-tartrate or dl-arginine.<br>
Conventional techniques for the preparation/isolation of individual enantiomers include chirai synthesis from a suitable optically pure precursor or resolution of the racemate (or the racemate. of a salt or derivative) using, for example, chirai high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC).<br>
Alternatively, the racemate (or a racemic precursor) may be reacted with a suitable optically active compound, for example, an alcohol, or, in the case where the compound of formula (I) contains an acidic or basic moiety, a base or acid such as 1-phenylethylamine or tartaric acid. The resulting dlastereomeric mixture may be separated by chromatography and/or fractional crystallization and one or both of the<br><br>
diastereoisomers converted to the corresponding pure enantiomer(s) by means well known to a skilled person.<br>
Chiral compounds of the invention (and chiral precursors thereof) may be obtained in enantiomerically-enriched form using chromatography, typically HPLC. on an asymmetric resin with a mobile phase consisting of a hydrocarbon, typically heptane or hexane, containing from 0 to 50% by volume of isopropanol, typically from 2% to 20%, and from 0 to 5% by volume of an alkylamine, typically 0.1% diethylamine. Concentration of the eluate affords the enriched) mixture.<br>
Stereoisomeric conglomerates may be separated by conventional techniques known to those skilled in the art • see, for example, Stereochemistry of Organic Compounds by E. L Eliel and S. H. Wilen {Wiley, New York, 1994).<br>
The present invention includes all pharmaceutically acceptable isotopically-labelled compounds of formula (I) wherein one or more atoms are replaced by atoms having the same atomic number, but an atomic mass or mass number different from the atomic mass or mass number which predominates in nature.<br>
Examples of isotopes suitable for inclusion in the compounds of the invention include Isotopes of hydrogen, such as 2H and 3H, carbon, such as 11C, 13C and 14C, chlorine, such as ^Cl, fluorine, such as 18F, nitrogen, such as 1SN and 1SN, oxygen, such as 150,1rO and 18O, and sulphur, such as ^S.<br>
Certain isotopically-labelled compounds of formula (I), for '.example, those Incorporating a radioactive isotope, are useful in drug and/or substrate tissue distribution studies. The radioactive Isotopes tritium, i.e. 3H, and carbon-14, i.e. 1*C, are particularly useful for this purpose in view of their ease of incorporation and ready means of detection.<br>
Substitution with heavier isotopes such as deuterium, i.e. 2H, may afford certain therapeutic advantages resulting from greater metabolic stability, for example, increased In vivo half-life or reduced dosage requirements, and hence may be preferred in some circumstances.<br>
Substitution with positron emitting isotopes, such as 11C, 18F, 1SO and 13N, can be useful in Positron Emission Topography (PET) studies for examining substrate receptor occupancy.<br>
isotopically-labelled compounds of formula (I) can generally be prepared by conventional techniques known to those skilled in the art or by processes analogous to those described in the accompanying Examples and Preparations using an appropriate isotopically-labelled reagent in place of the non-labelled reagent previously employed.<br><br>
Pharmaceutically acceptable solvates in accordance with the invention include those wherein the solvent of crystallization may be isotopically substituted, e.g. D2O, de-acetone, d6-DMSO.<br>
Also within the scope of the invention are novel intermediates as herein defined, all salts, solvates and complexes thereof and all solvates and complexes of salts thereof as defined herein for compounds of formula (I). The invention includes all polymorphs of the aforementioned species and crystal habits thereof.<br>
When preparing compounds of formula (I) in accordance with the invention, it is open to a person skilled in the art to routinely select the form of intermediate compound which provides the best combination of features for this purpose. Such features include the melting point, solubility, processability and yield of the intermediate form and the resulting ease with which the product may be purified on isolation.<br>
The crystal structures of the compounds of example numbers 80,26,93,73, 63 and 60 were analyzed using powder X-ray diffraction ("PXRD")1<br>
Illustrative PXRD patterns for these compounds are shown in Figures 1-6 containing 15% silicon internal reference standard.<br>
Figurel : Example 80	Figure 4: Example 73<br>
Figure 2: Example 26	Figure 5: Example 63<br>
Figure 3: Example 93	Figure 6 : Example 60<br>
The X-ray diffraction data were collected at room temperature using a Bruker AXS D4 powder X-ray diffractometer (Cu Ka radiation) fitted with an automatic sample changer, a theta-theta goniometer, automatic beam divergence slits, a secondary monochromator and a scintillation counter. Samples were prepared for analysis by mixing the compound with a silicon powder internal reference at 15% content by weight. The powders were mounted on a 12mm diameter silicon wafer specimen holder. The sample was rotated while being irradiated with Copper Kal X-rays (wavelength = 1.5406 Angstroms) with the X-ray tube operated at 40kV/40mA. The analyses were performed with the goniometer running in continuous mode set for a 5 second count per 0.02° step over a two theta range of 2° to 55°. The peaks obtained were aligned against the silicon reference standard (ICDD reference number 001-0791).<br>
As will be appreciated by the skilled crystallographer, the relative Intensities of the various peaks reported in the Tables and Rgures below may vary due to a number of factors such as orientation effects of crystals in the X-ray beam or the purity of the material being analyzed or the degree of crystallimty of the sample. The peak positions may also shift for variations in sample weight but the peak positions will remain substantially as defined fn the Figures. The skilled crystallographer also wil! appreciate that measurements using a different wavelength will result in different shifts according to the Bragg equation - nX = 2d sin9.<br><br>
Such further PXRD patterns generated by use o1 alternative wavelengths are considered to be alternative representations of the PXRD patterns of the crystalline materials of the present invention and as such are within the scope of the present invention.<br>
Tables 1-6 list the corresponding main diffraction peaks in terms of 29 values and intensities for the compounds excluding those peaks that can be assigned to the silicon reference standard. All 26 values are to +/- 0.1 degree.<br><br>

Assay; TNFa screen<br>
The anti-inflammatory properties of the compounds of the invention are demonstrated by their ability to inhibit TNFa release from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Venous blood is collected from healthy volunteers and the mononuclear cells purified by centrifugation through Histopaque (Ficoll) cushions. TNFa production from these ceils is stimulated by addition of lipopolysaccharide. After 18 hours<br><br>
Incubatlon in the presence of LPS, the cell supernatant is removed and the concentration of TNFa in the supernatant determined by ELISA. Addition of the compounds of the invention reduces the amount of TNFa produced. An IC60 is determined which Is equal to the concentration of compound that gives 50% inhibition of TNFa production as compared to the LPS stimulated control wells.<br>
The examples were tested in the assay described above and were found 1o have an \C&amp;&gt; {TNFa screen) of less than 1000nM, and for most of the tested compounds, were found to have an ICso (TNFa screen) of even Jess than lOOnM.<br>

p38 Klnase Assay: Cloning of human p3Ba:<br>
The coding region of the human p38a cDNA was obtained by PCR-amplification from RNA isolated from the human monocyte cell line THP.1. First strand CDNA was synthesized from total RNA as follows; 2 ug of RNA was annealed to 100 ng of random hexamer primers in a 10 pi reaction by heating to 70° C. for 10 minutes followed by 2 minutes on ice. cDNA was then synthesized by adding 1 ul of RNAsin (Promega, Madison Wis.), 2 ul of 50 mM dNTP's, 4 ul of 5X buffer, 2 ul of 100 mM DTT and 1 ul (200 U) of Superscript II™ AMV reverse transcriptase. Random primer, dNTP's and Superscript II™ reagents were all purchased from Life-Technologies, Gaithersburg, Mass. The reaction was incubated at 42° C. for 1 hour. Amplification of p38 cDNA was performed by aliquoting 5 ul of the reverse transcriptase reaction into a 100 ul PCR reaction containing the following: 80 ul dH.sub.2 O, 2. ul 50 mM dNTP's, 1 pi each of forward and reverse primers (50 pmoVul), 10 pi of 10X buffer and 1 ul Expand™ polymerase (Boehringer Mannheim). The PCR primers incorporated Barn HI sites onto the 5' and 3' end of the amplified fragment, and were purchased from Genosys. The sequences of the forward and reverse primers were 5'-GATCGAGGATTCATGTCTCAGGAGAGGCCCA-3'and5'GATCGAGGATTCTCAGGACTCCATCTCTTC-3' respectively. The PCR amplification was carried out in a DNA Thermal Cycler (PeTkin Elmer) by repeating 30 cycles of 94° C. for 1 minute, 60° C. for 1 minute and 68° C. for 2 minutes. After amplification, excess primers and unincorporated dNTP's were removed from the amplified fragment with a Wizard™ PCR prep (Promega) and digested with Bam HI (New England Bloiabs). The Bam HJ digested fragment was llgated into BamHI digested pGEX 2T plasmld DNA (PharmaciaBiotech) using T-4 DNA iigase (New England Bioiabs) as described by T. Maniatis, Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 2nd ed. (1989). The Ifgation reaction was transformed Into chemically competent E. coli DH1QB cells purchased from Ufe-Technologies following the manufacturer's instructions. Plasmfd DNA was isolated from the resulting bacterial colonies using a Promega Wizard™ miniprep kit. Plasmids containing the appropriate Bam HI<br><br>
fragment were sequenced in a DMA Thermal Cycler (Perkin Elmer} with Prism™ (Applied Biosystems Inc.). cDNA clones were Identified that coded for both human p38a isoforms (Lee et al. Nature 372, 739). One of the clones that contained the cDNA for p38a-2 (CSB-2) inserted in the cloning site of PGEX 2T, 3' of the GST coding region was designated pMON 35802. The sequence obtained for this clone is an exact match of the cDNA done reported by Lee et al. This expression plasmld allows for the production of a GST-p38a fusion protein.<br>
Expression of human p38a<br>

Kinetics Assays Association kinetics:<br>
SKF-86002 (from Calbiochem; KD - 200nM) gives an increase in fluorescence upon binding to p38a (as monitored by an excitation at 340nm and emission at 420nm). SKF-86002 (1 -2uM) was preincubated with p38a (20-60nM) for 5-10min at room temperature in a buffer consisting of 20mM Bls-Tris, 2mM EDTA, SOOmM NaCI, 0.01% NaN3, 0.15% NOG and 5% DMSO. The sample compound (20-100nM) was then added and the change in fluorescence monitored. As SKF dissociated from its binding site on p38a, the SKF was replaced by the sample compound and a decrease in fluorescence was observed on a time scale proportional to the association rate of the compound. Using the known binding kinetics of SKF-86002, the association rate of the compound was measured.<br>
Dissociation kinetics:<br>
Sample compounds (50 or 100nM) were preincubated with p38a (37nM protein or 21 nM as determined by active site titration) overnight at room temperature In a buffer consisting of 20mM Bis-Tris, 2mM EDTA, 0.01% NaN3,0.15% NOG, SOOmM NaCI and 5% DMSO. The following day, SKF 86002 was added to a final concentration of 50uM. The fluorescence increase observed upon the binding of SKF 86002 to p38a was monitored by excitation at 340nm and emission at 420nm, and the dissociation rate was measured.<br>
