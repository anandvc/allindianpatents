Anthranilic acid- and Thioanthranilic acid-N-arvl amides<br>
The invention relates to new benzamide derivatives, processes for the preparation thereof, the application thereof in a process for the treatment of the human or animal body, the use thereof - alone or in combination with one or more other pharmaceutical^ active compounds - for the treatment especially of a neoplastic disease, such as a tumor disease, of retinopathy and age-related macular degeneration; a method for the treatment of such a disease in animals, especially in humans, and the use of such a compound - alone or in combination with one or more other pharmaceutical^ active compounds - for manufacture of a pharmaceutical preparation (medicament) for the treatment of a neoplastic disease, of retinopathy and age-related macular degeneration.<br>
Certain diseases are known to be associated with deregulated angiogenesis, for example diseases caused by ocular neovascularisation, such as retinopathies (including diabetic retinopathy), age-related macula degeneration, psoriasis, haemangioblastoma, haeman-gioma, arteriosclerosis, an inflammatory disease, such as a rheumatoid or rheumatic inflammatory disease, especially arthritis, such as rheumatoid arthritis, or other chronic inflammatory disorders, such as chronic asthma, arterial or post-transplantational atherosclerosis, endometriosis, and especially neoplastic diseases, for example so-called solid tumours and liquid tumours (such as leucemias).<br>
According to recent findings, at the centre of the network regulating the growth and differentiation of the vascular system and its components, both during embryonic development and normal growth and in a wide number of pathological anomalies and diseases, lies the angiogenic factor known as "Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor" (=VGEF; originally termed "Vascular Permeability Factor", =VPF), along with its cellular receptors (see Breier, G., et al., Trends in Cell Biology 6,454-6 [1996] and references cited therein).<br>
VEGF is a dimeric, disulfide-linked 46-kDa glycoprotein and is related to "Platelet-Derived Growth Factor" (PDGF). it is produced by normal cell lines and tumor cell lines, is an endothelial cell-specific mitogen, shows angiogenic activity in in wVo test systems (e.g. rabbit cornea), is chemotactic for endothelial cells and monocytes, and induces plasminogen activators in endothelial cells, which are then involved in the proteolytic degradation of extracellu-<br><br>
lar matrix during the formation of capillaries. A number of isoforms of VEGF are known, which show comparable biological activity, but differ in the type of cells that secrete them and in their heparin-binding capacity. In addition, there are other members of the VEGF family, such as "Placenta Growth Factor" (PLGF) and VEGF-C.<br>
VEGF receptors are transmembranous receptor tyrosine kinases. They are characterized by an extracellular domain with seven immunoglobulin-like domains and an intracellular tyrosine kinase domain. Various types of VEGF receptor are known, e.g. VEGFR-1, VEGFR-2, and VEGFR-3.<br>
A large number of human tumors, especially gliomas and carcinomas, express high levels of VEGF and its receptors. This has led to the hypothesis that the VEGF released by tumor cells could stimulate the growth of blood capillaries and the proliferation of tumor endothelium in a paracrine manner and thus, through the improved blood supply, accelerate tumor growth. Increased VEGF expression could explain the occurrence of cerebral oedema in patients with glioma. Direct evidence of the role of VEGF as a tumor angiogenesis factor in vivo has been obtained from studies in which VEGF expression or VEGF activity was inhibited. This was achieved with antibodies which inhibit VEGF activity, with dominant-negative VEGFR-2 mutants which inhibited signal transduction, or with the use of antisense-VEGF RNA techniques. All approaches led to a reduction in the growth of glioma cell lines or other tumor cell lines in vivo as a result of inhibited tumor angiogenesis.<br>
Angiogenesis is regarded as an absolute prerequisite for those tumors which grow beyond a maximum diameter of about 1-2 mm; up to this limit, oxygen and nutrients may be supplied to the tumor cells by diffusion. Every tumor, regardless of its origin and its cause, is thus dependent on angiogenesis for its growth after it has reached a certain size.<br>
Three principal mechanisms play an important part in the activity of angiogenesis inhibitors against tumors: 1) Inhibition of the growth of vessels, especially capillaries, into avascular resting tumors, with the result that there is no net tumor growth owing to the balance that is achieved between apoptosis and proliferation; 2) Prevention of the migration of tumor cells owing to the absence of blood flow to and from tumors; and 3) Inhibition of endothelial cell proliferation, thus avoiding the paracrine growth-stimulating effect exerted on the surrounding tissue by the endothelial cells which normally line the vessels.<br><br>
Surprisingly, it has now been found that benzamide derivatives of formula I, described below, are a new class of compounds that have advantageous pharmacological properties and inhibit, for example, the activity of the VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase, the growth of tumors and VEGF-dependent cell proliferation, or the treatment of especially inflammatory rheumatic or rheumatoid diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, and/or pain, or the other diseases mentioned above and below.<br>
The compounds of formula I open up, for example, an unexpected new therapeutic approach, especially for diseases in the treatment of which, and also for the prevention of which, an inhibition of angiogenesis and/or of the VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase shows beneficial effects.<br>

The efficacy of the compounds of the invention as inhibitors of VEGF-receptor tyrosine kinase activity can be demonstrated as follows:<br>
Test for activity against VEGF-receptor tyrosine kinase. The test is conducted using Flt-1 VEGF-receptor tyrosine kinase. The detailed procedure is as follows: 30 \i\ kinase solution (10 ng of the kinase domain of Flt-1, Shibuya et al., Oncogene 5, 519-24 [1990]) in 20 mM Tris^HCI pH 7.5, 3 mM manganese dichloride (MnCI2), 3 mM magnesium chloride (MgCI2), 10 fiM sodium vanadate, 0.25 mg/ml polyethylenglycol (PEG) 20000,1mM dithiothreitol and 3 ng/jil poly(Glu,Tyr) 4:1 (Sigma, Buchs, Switzerland), 8 jiM [^PJ-ATP (0.2 \iC\), 1% dimethyl sulfoxide, and 0 to 100 \iM of the compound to be tested are incubated together for 10 minutes at room temperature. The reaction is then terminated by the addition of 10 nl 0.25 M ethylenediaminetetraacetate (EDTA) pH 7. Using a multichannel dispenser (LAB SYSTEMS, USA), an aliquot of 20 *il is applied to a PVDF (= polyvinyl difluoride) Immobilon P membrane (Miliipore, USA), through a Millipore microtiter filter manifold and connected to a vacuum. Following complete elimination of the liquid, the membrane is washed 4 times successively in a bath containing 0.5% phosphoric acid (H3P04) and once with ethanol, incubated for 10 minutes each time while shaking, then mounted in a Hewlett Packard TopCount Manifold and the radioactivity measured after the addition of 10//I Microscint® (13-scintillation counter liquid). ICso-values are determined by linear regression analysis of the percentages for the inhibition of each compound in three concentrations (as a rule 0.01, 0.1, and 1 nmol). The ICso-values that can be found with compounds of formula I are in the range of 0.01 to 100 \iM, preferably in the range from 0.01 to 50 \iM.<br>
The antitumor efficacy of the compounds of the invention can be demonstrated in vivo as follows:<br>
In vivo activity in the nude mouse xenotransplant model: female BALB/c nude mice (8-12 weeks old), Novartis Animal Farm, Sisseln, Switzerland) are kept under sterile conditions with water and feed ad libitum. Tumors are induced either by subcutaneous injection of tumor cells into mice (for example, Du 145 prostate carcinoma cell line (ATCC No. HTB 81; see Cancer Research 37,4049-58 (1978)) or by implanting tumor fragments (about 25 mg) subcutaneously into the left flank of mice using a 13-gauge trocar needle under Forene® anaesthesia (Abbott, Switzerland). Treatment with the test compound is started as soon as<br><br>
the tumor has reached a mean volume of 100 mm3. Tumor growth is measured two to three times a week and 24 hours after the last treatment by determining the length of two perpendicular axes. The tumor volumes are calculated in accordance with published methods (see Evans et alM Brit. J. Cancer 45,466-8 [1982]). The antitumor efficacy is determined as the mean increase in tumor volume of the treated animals divided by the mean increase in tumor volume of the untreated animals (controls) and, after multiplication by 100, is expressed as 110%. Tumor regression (given in %) is reported as the smallest mean tumor volume in relation to the mean tumor volume at the start of treatment. The test compound is administered daily by gavage.<br>
As an alternative other cell lines may also be used in the same manner, for example:<br>
-	the MCF-7 breast adenocarcinoma cell line (ATCC No. HTB 22; see also J. Natl. Cancer Inst. (Bethesda) 51,1409-16 [1973]);<br>
-	the MDA-MB468 breast adenocarcinoma cell line (ATCC No. HTB 132; see also In Vitro 14, 911-15 [1978]);<br>
-	the MDA-MB 231 breast adenocarcinoma cell line (ATCC No. HTB 26; see also J. Natl. Cancer Inst. (Bethesda) 53, 661-74 [1974]);<br>
-	the Colo 205 colon carcinoma cell line (ATCC No. CCL 222; see also Cancer Res. 3§, 1345-55 [1978]);<br>
-	the HCT 116 colon carcinoma cell line (ATCC No. CCL 247; see also Cancer Res. 41, 1751-6 [1981]);<br>
-	the DU145 prostate carcinoma cell line DU 145 (ATCC No. HTB 81; see also Cancer Res. 37, 4049-58 [1978]); and<br>
-	the PC-3 prostate carcinoma cell line PC-3 (ATCC No. CRL 1435; see also Cancer Res. 40, 524-34 [1980]).<br>
The inhibition of VEGF-induced KDR-receptor autophosphorylation can be confirmed with a further in vitro experiment in cells: transfected CHO cells, which permanently express human VEGF receptor (KDR), are seeded in complete culture medium (with 10% fetal calf serum = FCS) in 6-well cell-culture plates and incubated at 37°C under 5% C02 until they show about 80% confluency. The compounds to be tested are then diluted in culture medium (without FCS, with 0.1% bovine serum albumin) and added to the cells. (Controls comprise medium without test compounds). After two hours1 incubation at 37°C, recombinant VEGF is added; the final VEGF concentration is 20 ng/ml). After a further five minutes' incubation at 37°C, the cells are<br><br>
washed twice with ice-cold PBS (phosphate-buffered saline) and immediately lysed in 100 //I lysis buffer per well. The lysates are then centrifuged to remove the cell nuclei, and the protein concentrations of the supematants are determined using a commercial protein assay (BIORAD). The lysates can then either be immediately used or, if necessary, stored at -20°C.<br>
A sandwich ELISA is carried out to measure the KDR-receptor phosphorylation: a monoclonal antibody to KDR (for example Mab 1495.12.14; prepared by H. Towbin) is immobilized on black ELISA plates (OptiPlate™ HTRF-96 from Packard). The plates are then washed and the remaining free protein-binding sites are saturated with 1% BSA in PBS. The cell lysates (20 fjg protein per well) are then incubated in these plates overnight at 4°C together with an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody coupled with alkaline phosphatase (PY20:AP from Transduction Laboratories). The (plates are washed again and the) binding of the antiphosphotyrosine antibody to the captured phosphorylated receptor is then demonstrated using a luminescent AP substrate (CDP-Star, ready to use, with Emerald II; TROPIX). The luminescence is measured in a Packard Top Count Microplate Scintillation Counter (Top Count). The difference between the signal of the positive control (stimulated with VEGF) and that of the negative control (not stimulated with VEGF) corresponds to VEGF-induced KDR-receptor phosphorylation (= 100 %). The activity of the tested substances is calculated as % inhibition of VEGF-induced KDR-receptor phosphorylation, wherein the concentration of substance that induces half the maximum inhibition is defined as the ED50 (effective dose for 50% inhibition). Compounds of formula I here preferably show ED50 values in the range of 0.001 jiM to 6 \*M, preferably 0.005 to 0.5 \JM.<br>
A compound of formula I or a N-oxide thereof inhibits to varying degrees also other tyrosine kinases involved in signal transduction which are mediated by trophic factors, for example Abl kinase, kinases from the Src family, especially c-Src kinase, Lck, and Fyn; also kinases of the EGF family, for example, c-erbB2 kinase (HER-2), c-erbB3 kinase, c-erbB4 kinase; insulin-like growth factor receptor kinase (IGF-1 kinase), especially members of the PDGF-receptor tyrosine kinase family, such as PDGF-receptor kinase, CSF-1-receptor kinase, Kit-receptor kinase and VEGF-receptor kinase; and also serine/threonine kinases, all of which play a role in growth regulation and transformation in mammalian cells, including human cells.<br><br>
The inhibition of c-erbB2 tyrosine kinase (HER-2) can be measured, for example, in the same way as the inhibition of EGF-R protein kinase (see House et al., Europ. J. Biochem. 140. 363-7 [1984]). The erbB2 kinase can be isolated, and its activity determined, using methods known perse (see T. Akiyama et al., Science 232,1644 [1986]).<br>
On the basis of these studies, a compound of formula I according to the invention shows therapeutic efficacy especially against disorders dependent on protein kinase, especially proliferative diseases.<br>
The usefulness of a compound of the formula I in the treatment of arthritis as an example of an inflammatory rheumatic or rheumatoid disease can be demonstrated as follows:<br>
The well-known rat adjuvant arthritis model (Pearson, Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. 91, 95-101 (1956)) is used to test the anti-arthritic activity of compounds of the formula I, or salts thereof. Adjuvant Arthritis can be treated using two different dosing schedules: either (i) starting time of immunisation with adjuvant (prophylactic dosing); or from day 15 when the arthritic response is already established (therapeutic dosing). Preferably a therapeutic dosing schedule is used. For comparison, a cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor, such as 5-bromo-2-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-[4-(methylsulfonyl)phenyl]thiophene or diclofenac, is administered in a separate group.<br>
In detail, male Wistar rats (5 animals per group, weighing epproximately 200 g, supplied by Iffa Credo, France) are injected i.d. (intra-dermally) at the base of the tail with 0.1 ml of mineral oil containing 0.6 mg of lyophilised heat-killed Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The rats are treated with the test compound (3,10 or 30 mg/kg p.o. once per day), or vehicle (water) from day 15 to day 22 (therapeutic dosing schedule). At the end of the experiment, the swelling of the tarsal joints is measured by means of a mico-calliper. Percentage inhibition of paw swelling is calculated by reference to vehicle treated arthritic animals (0 % inhibition) and vehicle treated normal animals (100 % inhibition).<br>
The activity of compounds of the formula I against pain can be shown in the following model of nociception (pain). In this model, the hyperalgesia caused by an intra-planar yeast injection is measured by applying increased pressure to the foot until the animal vocalizes or<br><br>
withdraws its foot from the applied pressure pad. The model is sensitive to COX inhibitors, and diclofenac at 3 mg/kg is used as a positive control.<br>
Method: The baseline pressure required to induce vocalization or withdrawal of the paw of male Sprague Dawley rats (weighing approximately 180 g, supplied by Iffa Credo, France) is measured (2 hours before treatment), followed by an intra-planar injection of 100 fxl of a 20 % yeast suspension in water in the hind paw. The rats are treated orally with the test compound (3,10 or 30 mg/kg), diclofenac (3 mg/kg) or vehicle (saline) p.o. 2 hours later (time point 0 hours), and the pressure test is repeated 1 and 2 hours after dosing. Using the standard apparatus supplied by Ugo Basile, Italy, the pressure required to induce vocalisation or paw withdrawal of the compound-treated rats at these time points is compared to that of vehicle-treated animals.<br>
On the basis of these studies, a compound of formula I surprisingly is appropriate for the treatment of inflammatory (especially rheumatic or rheumatoid) diseases and/or pain. The compounds of the formula I, especially IA, (or an N-oxide thereof) according to the invention also show therapeutic efficacy especially against other disorders dependent on protein kinase, especially proliferative diseases.<br>
On the basis of their efficacy as inhibitors of VEGF-receptor tyrosine kinase activity, the compounds of the formula I primarily inhibit the growth of blood vessels and are thus, for example, effective against a number of diseases associated with deregulated angiogenesis, especially diseases caused by ocular neovascularisation, especially retinopathies, such as diabetic retinopathy or age-related macula degeneration, psoriasis, haemangioblastoma, such as haemangioma, mesangial cell proliferative disorders, such as chronic or acute renal diseases, e.g. diabetic nephropathy, malignant nephrosclerosis, thrombotic microangiopathy syndromes or transplant rejection, or especially inflammatory renal disease, such as glomerulonephritis, especially mesangioproliferative glomerulonephritis, haemolytic-uraemic syndrome, diabetic nephropathy, hypertensive nephrosclerosis, atheroma, arterial restenosis, autoimmune diseases, acute inflammation, fibrotic disorders (e.g. hepatic cirrhosis), diabetes, endometriosis, chronic asthma, arterial or post-transplantational atherosclerosis, neurodegenerative disorders and especially neoplastic diseases (solid tumours, but also leucemias and other "liquid tumours", especially those expressing c-kit, KDR or flt-1), such as especially breast cancer, cancer of the colon, lung cancer (especially<br><br>
small-cell lung cancer), cancer of the prostate or Kaposi's sarcoma. A compound of formula I (or an N-oxide thereof) inhibits the growth of tumours and is especially suited to preventing the metastatic spread of tumours and the growth of micrometastases.<br>
A compound of formula I can be administered alone or in combination with one or more other therapeutic agents, possible combination therapy taking the form of fixed combinations or the administration of a compound of the invention and one or more other therapeutic agents being staggered or given independently of one another, or the combined administration of fixed combinations and one or more other therapeutic agents. A compound of formula I can besides or in addition be administered especially for tumor therapy in combination with chemotherapy, radiotherapy, immunotherapy, surgical intervention, or a combination of these. Long-term therapy is equally possible as is adjuvant therapy in the context of other treatment strategies, as described above. Other possible treatments are therapy to maintain*the patient's status after tumor regression, or even chemopreventive therapy, for example in patients at risk.<br>
Therapeutic agents for possible combination are especially one or more cytostatic or cytotoxic compounds, for example a chemotherapeutic agent or several selected from the group comprising an inhibitor of polyamine biosynthesis, an inhibitor of protein kinase, especially of serine/threonine protein kinase, such as protein kinase C, or of tyrosine protein kinase, such as epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase, a cytokine, a negative growth regulator, such as TGF-B or IFN-3, an aromatase inhibitor, a classical cytostatic, and an inhibitor of the interaction of an SH2 domain with a phosphorylated protein.<br>
A compound according to the invention is not only for the (prophylactic and preferably therapeutic) management of humans, but also for the treatment of other warm-blooded animals, for example of commercially useful animals, for example rodents, such as mice, rabbits or rats, or guinea-pigs. Such a compound may also be used as a reference standard in the test systems described above to permit a comparison with other compounds.<br>
In general, the invention relates also to the use of a compound of formula I or a N-oxide thereof for the inhibition of VEGF-receptor tyrosine activity, either in vitro or in vivo.<br><br>
A compound of formula I or a N-oxide thereof may also be used for diagnostic purposes, for example with tumors that have been obtained from warm-blooded animal "hosts", especially humans, and implanted into mice to test them for decreases in growth after treatment with such a compound, in order to investigate their sensitivity to the said compound and thus to improve the detection and determination of possible therapeutic methods for neoplastic diseases in the original host.<br>

In the more detailed description of the process below, R1f R2, R3, FU, R5, Re. R7, Rs. R9. R10,<br>
X, Y and W are as defined for compounds of formula 1, unless otherwise indicated.<br>
Process a) (reductive alkylation)<br>
The carbonyl compound of the formula III may also be present in the form of reactive<br>
derivative; however, the free aldehyde or ketone is preferred.<br>
Reactive derivatives of the compounds of formula III are, for example, corresponding bisulfite adducts or especially semiacetals, acetals, semiketals or ketals of compounds of formula III with alcohols, for example lower alkanols; or thioacetals or thioketals of compounds of formula III with mercaptans, for example lower alkanesulfides.<br>
The reductive alkylation is preferably carried out with hydrogenation in the presence of a catalyst, especially a noble metal catalyst, such as platinum or especially palladium, which is preferably bonded to a carrier material, such as carbon, or a heavy metal catalyst, such as Raney nickel, at normal pressure or at pressures of from 0.1 to 10 MegaPascal (MPa), or with reduction by means of complex hydrides, such as borohydrides, especially alkali metal cyanoborohydrides, for example sodium cyanoborohydride, in the presence of a suitable<br><br>
acid, preferably relatively weak acids, such as lower alkanecarboxylic acids, especially acetic acid, or a sulfonic acid, such as p-toluenesulfonic acid; in customary solvents, for example alcohols, such as methanol or ethanol, or ethers, for example cyclic ethers, such as tetrahydrofuran, in the presence or absence of water.<br>
Process b) (condensation)<br>
In this process the reagents introducing the radical R2Y- contain either a free sulfo group (formula IVa) or are in the form of a reactive derivative thereof, for example in the form of a derived activated ester or reactive anhydride, or in the form of a reactive cyclic amide, or contain the sulfo group in the form of a sulfonic acid halide (formula IVb). Reactive derivatives may also be formed in situ.<br>
In formula IVb Hal' is preferably chlorine or bromine. The reaction is carried out in a suitable solvent, e.g. dichloromethane, e.g. at room temperature or the reflux temperature of the solvent, in the presence of a suitable amine, e.g. N-ethyldiisopropylamine, and optionally 4-dimethylaminopyridine.<br>
The amino group of compounds of formula II that participates in the reaction preferably is in free form, especially when the sulfonyl group reacting therewith is present in reactive form; it may, however, itself have been derivatised, for example by reaction with a phosphite, such as diethylchlorophosphite, 1,2-phenylene chlorophosphite, ethyldichlorophosphite, ethylene chlorophosphite or tetraethylpyrophosphite. A derivative of such a compound having an amino group is, for example, also a carbamic acid halide or an isocyanate, the amino group that participates in the reaction being substituted by halocarbonyl, for example chlorocarbonyl, or modified in the form of an isocyanate group, respectively.<br>
The condensation of activated esters, reactive anhydrides or reactive cyclic amides with the corresponding amines is customarily carried out in the presence of an anorganic base, such as an alkaline metal hydrogencarbonate of carbonate, or especially an organic base, for example simple tri-Iower alkylamines, for example triethylamine or tributylamine, or one of the above-mentioned organic bases. If desired, a condensation agent is additionally used, for example as described for free carboxylic acids.<br><br>
The condensation is preferably carried out in an inert, aprotic, preferably anhydrous, solvent or solvent mixture, for example in a carboxylic acid amide, for example formamide or di-methylformamide, a halogenated hydrocarbon, for example methylene chloride, carbon tetrachloride or chlorobenzene, a ketone, for example acetone, a cyclic ether, for example te-trahydrofuran or dioxane, an ester, for example ethyl acetate, or a nitrile, for example aceto-nitrile, or in a mixture thereof, as appropriate at reduced or elevated temperature, for example in a temperature range of from approximately -40° to approximately +100°C, preferably from approximately -10° to approximately +70°C, and when arylsulfonyl esters are used also at approximately from +100° to +200°C, especially at temperatures of from 10° to 30 °C, and if necessary under an inert gas atmosphere, for example a nitrogen or argon atmosphere.<br>
Aqueous, for example alcoholic, solvents, for example ethanol, or aromatic solvents, for example benzene or toluene, may also be used. When alkali metal hydroxides are present as bases, acetone may also be added where appropriate.<br>
Process c) (amination)<br>
The amination process is preferably carried out as an Ullmann type reaction using a copper catalyst, such as copper[0] or a copperfl] compound such as copper[l]oxide, copper[l]-bromide or copper[l]iodide in the presence of a suitable base (such as a metal carbonate, for example potassium carbonate) to neutralise the acid generated in the reaction. This reaction is reviewed in Houben-Weyl "Methoden der Organischen Chemie", Band 11/1, page 32 -33.1958, in Organic Reactions, Volume 14, page 19-24, 1965 and by J. Lindley (1984) in Tetrahedron, Volume 40, page 1433 -1456. The amount of catalyst is typically in the range of 1 to 20 mole percent. The reaction is carried out in an inert, aprotic solvent such as an ether (for example dimethoxyethane or dioxan) or an amide (for example dimethylformamide or /V-methylpyrrolidone), under an inert atmosphere in the temperature<br>
range of 60 - 180°C.<br>
An alternative amination process involves using a Group VIII element, where the metal core of the catalyst should be a zero-valent transition metal, such as palladium or nickel, which has the ability to undergo oxidative addition to the Aryl-Halogen bond. The zero valent state of the metal may be generated in situ from the M[ll] state. The catalyst complexes may<br><br>
include chelating ligands, such as alkyl, aryl or heteroaryl derivatives of phoshines or biphosphines, imines or arsines. Preferred cataysts contain palladium or nickel. Examples of such catalysts include palladium[ll]chloride, pailadium[ll]acetate, tetrakis(triphenyl-phosphine)palladium[0] and nickel[ll]acetylacetonate. The metal catayst is typically in the range of 0.1 to 10 mole percent. The chelating ligands may be either monodentate, as in the case for example of trialkyphosphines, such as tributylphosphine, triaryl phosphines, such as tri-(ort/70-tolyl)phosphine, and triheteroaryl phosphines, such as tri-2-furyl-phosphine; or they may be bidentate such as in the case of 2,2,-bis9diphenylphosphino)-1,1 'binaphthyl, 1,2-bis(diphenylphosphino)ethane, 1,1 '-bis(diphenylphosphino)ferrocene and 1-(A/,A/-dimethyl-amino)-1'-(dicyclohexylphosphino)biphenyl. The supporting ligand may be added may be complexed to the metal centre in the form of a metal complex prior to being added to the reaction mixture or may be added to the reaction mixture as a separate compound. The supporting ligand is typically present in the range 0.01 to 20 mole percent. It is often necessary to add a suitable base to the reaction mixture, such as a trialkylamine (for example diisoprpylethylamine or 1 ,5-diazabicyclo[5,4,0]undec-5-ene)f a Group I alkali metal alkoxide (for example potassium tert/a/y-butoxide) or carbonate (for example caesium carbonate) or potassium phosphate. The reaction is typically carried out in an inert aprotic solvent such as an ether (for example dimethoxyethane or dioxan) or an amide (for example dimethylformamide or /V-methylpyrrolidone), under an inert atmosphere in the temperature<br>
range of 60-180°C.<br>
The amination is preferably carried out in an inert, aprotic, preferably anhydrous, solvent or solvent mixture, for example in a carboxylic acid amide, for example dimethylformamide or dimethylacetamide, a cyclic ether, for example tetrahydrofuran or dioxane, or a nitrile, for example acetonitrile, or in a mixture thereof, at an appropriate temperature, for example in a temperature range of from approximately 40° to approximately 180°C, and if necessary under an inert gas atmosphere, for example a nitrogen or argon atmosphere.<br>
Process d) (amidation)<br>
In this process first a dimethylaluminium amide is prepared in situ from MesAI and an appropriate amine. Then the esters to be treated are added and the reaction is carried out at a temperature between 20 °C and 150 °C, preferably between 100 °C and 120 °C, e.g. at<br><br>
110°C, depending on the'reactivity of the amide and the ester, in an inert solvent like benzene, toluene, xylene, tetrahydrofuran, C6-Ci0 alkanes, or a mixture thereof.<br>
N-Oxides can be obtained in a known matter by reacting a compound of formula I with hydrogen peroxide or a peracid, e.g. 3-chloroperoxy-benzoic acid, in an inert solvent, e.g. dichloromethane, at a temperature between -10 °C and + 35°C, e.g. 0 °C or room temperature.<br>
Protecting groups<br>
If one or more other functional groups, for example carboxy, hydroxy, amino, or mercapto, are or need to be protected in a compound of formulae II, III and/or IV, because they should not take part in the reaction, these are such groups as are usually used in the synthesis of peptide compounds, and also of cephalosporins and penicillins, as well as nucleic acid derivatives and sugars.<br>
The protecting groups may already be present in precursors and should protect the functional groups concerned against unwanted secondary reactions, such as acylations, etheri-fications, esterifications, oxidations, solvolysis, and similar reactions. It is a characteristic of protecting groups that they lend themselves readily, i.e. without undesired secondary reactions, to removal, typically by solvolysis, reduction, photolysis or also by enzyme activity, for example under conditions analogous to physiological conditions, and that they are not present in the end-products.The specialist knows, or can easily establish, which protecting groups are suitable with the reactions mentioned hereinabove and hereinafter.<br>
The protection of such functional groups by such protecting groups, the protecting groups themselves, and their removal reactions are described for example in standard reference works, such as J. F. W. McOmie, "Protective Groups in Organic Chemistry", Plenum Press, London and New York 1973, in T. W. Greene, "Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis", Wiley, New York 1981, in "The Peptides"; Volume 3 (editors: E. Gross and J. Meienhofer), Academic Press, London and New York 1981, in "Methoden der organischen Chemie" (Methods of organic chemistry}, Houben Weyl, 4th edition, Volume 15/1, Georg Thieme Verlag, Stuttgart 1974, in H.-D. Jakubke and H. Jescheit, "Aminosauren, Peptide, Proteine" (Amino acids, peptides, proteins), Verlag Chemie, Weinheim, Deerfield Beach, and Basel 1982, and in Jochen Lehmann, "Chemie der Kohlenhydrate: Monosaccharide und Derivate"<br><br>
(Chemistry of carbohydrates: monosaccharides and derivatives), Georg Thieme Verlag, Stuttgart 1974.<br>
Additional process steps<br>
In the additional process steps, carried out as desired, functional groups of the starting compounds which should not take part in the reaction may be present in unprotected form or may be protected for example by one or more of the protecting groups mentioned hereinabove under "protecting groups". The protecting groups are then wholly or partly removed according to one of the methods described there.<br>
Salts of a compound of formula I with a salt-forming group may be prepared in a manner known perse. Acid addition salts of compounds of formula I may thus be obtained by treatment with an acid or with a suitable anion exchange reagent. A salt with two acid molecules (for example a dihalogenide of a compound of formula I) may also be converted into a salt with one acid molecule per compound (for example a monohalogenide); this may be done by heating to a melt, or for example by heating as a solid under a high vacuum at elevated temperature, for example from 130 to 170°C, one molecule of the acid being expelled per molecule of a compound of formula I.<br>
Salts can usually be converted to free compounds, e.g. by treating with suitable basic agents, for example with alkali metal carbonates, alkali metal hydrogencarbonates, or alkali metal hydroxides, typically potassium carbonate or sodium hydroxide.<br>
Stereoisomeric mixtures, e.g. mixtures of diastereomers, can be separated into their corresponding isomers in a manner known perse by means of suitable separation methods. Dia-stereomeric mixtures for example may be separated into their individual diastereomers by means of fractionated crystallization, chromatography, solvent distribution, and similar procedures. This separation may take place either at the level of a starting compound or in a compound of formula I itself. Enantiomers may be separated through the formation of dia-stereomeric salts, for example by salt formation with an enantiomer-pure chiral acid, or by means of chromatography, for example by HPLC, using chromatographic substrates with chiral ligands.<br>
A compound of formula I, wherein W is O, can be converted into the respective compound<br><br>
wherein W is S, for example, by using an appropriate sulfur compound, e.g. using reaction with Lawesson's reagent (2,4-bis-(4-methoxyphenyl)2,4-dithioxo-1,2,3,4-dithiaphosphetan) in a halogenated carbon hydrate, such as dichloromethane, or an aprotic solvent, such as toluene or xylene, at temperatures from about 30 °C to reflux.<br>
A compound of the formula I wherein any one or both of R7 and R9 is hydrogen and is part of a sulfonamide (Y is S02) bond can be converted to the respective compound wherein R7 and/or R9 is lower alkyl by reaction e.g. with a diazo lower alkyl compound, especially diazomethane, in an inert solvent, preferably in the presence of a noble metal catalyst, especially in dispersed form, e.g. copper, or a noble metal salt, e.g. cupper(l)-chloride or copper(ll)-sulfate. Also reaction with lower alkylhalogenides is possible, or with other leaving group carrying lower alkanes, e.g. lower alkyl alcohols esterified by a strong organic sulfonic acid, such as a lower alkane sulfonic acid (optionally substituted by halogen, such as fluoro), an aromatic sulfonic acid, for example unsubstituted or substituted benzene-sulfonic acid, the substituents preferably being selected from lower alkyl, such as methyl, halogen, such as bromo, and/or nitro, e.g. esterified by methane sulfonic acid, trimethane sulfonic acid or p-toluol sulfonic acid.<br>
Also, in a compound of the formula I wherein R8 is hydrogen and Y is CR9Rio(CH2)n, the alkylation may be made with such alkylating agents.<br>
In both cases, the alkylation takes place especially in aqueous solution and/or in the presence of polar solvents, typically alcohols, for example methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, or ethylene glycol, ethers, typically dioxane, amides, typically dimethylformamide, or phenols, typically phenol, and also under non-aqueous conditions, in non-polar solvents, typically benzene and toluene, or in benzene/water emulsions, where applicable in the presence of acidic or basic catalysts, for example leaches, typically sodium hydroxide solution, or in the presence of solid-phase catalysts, typically aluminium oxide, that have been doped with hydrazine, in ethers, for example diethylether, generally at temperatures from about 0°C to the boiling temperature of the corresponding reaction mixture, preferably between 20°C and reflux temperature, if necessary under increased pressure, e.g. in a sealed tube, a temperature in excess of boiling point also being possible, and/or under inert gas, typically nitrogen or argon.<br><br>
It should be emphasizecfthat reactions analogous to tne conversions mentioned in tnis chapter may also take place at the level of appropriate intermediates.<br>
General process conditions<br>
All process steps described here can be carried out under known reaction conditions, preferably under those specifically mentioned, in the absence of or usually in the presence of solvents or diluents, preferably such as are inert to the reagents used and able to dissolve these, in the absence or presence of catalysts, condensing agents or neutralisiing agents, for example ion exchangers, typically cation exchangers, for example in the H+ form, depending on the type of reaction and/or reactants at reduced, normal, or elevated temperature, for example in the range from -100°C to about 190°C, preferably from about -80°C to about 150°C, for example at -80 to -60°C, at room temperature, at - 20 to 40°C or at the boiling point of the solvent used, under atmospheric pressure or in a closed vessel, where appropriate under pressure, and/or in an inert atmosphere, for example under argon or nitrogen.<br>
Salts may be present in all starting compounds and transients, if these contain salt-forming groups. Salts may also be present during the reaction of such compounds, provided the reaction is not thereby disturbed.<br>
At all reaction stages, isomeric mixtures that occur can be separated into their individual isomers, e.g. diastereomers or enantiomers, or into any mixtures of isomers, e.g. racemates or diastereomeric mixtures, typically as described under "Additional process steps".<br>
In certain cases, typically in hydrogenation processes, it is possible to achieve stereoselective reactions, allowing for example easier recovery of individual isomers.<br>
The solvents from which those can be selected which are suitable for the reaction in question include for example water, esters, typically lower alkyl-lower alkanoates, e.g diethyl acetate, ethers, typically aliphatic ethers, e.g. diethylether, or cyclic ethers, e.g. tetrahydro-furan, liquid aromatic hydrocarbons, typically benzene or toluene, alcohols, typically methanol, ethanol or 1- or 2-propanol, nitrites, typically acetonitrile, halogenated hydrocarbons, typically dichloromethane, acid amides, typically dimethylformamide, bases, typically heterocyclic nitrogen bases, e.g. pyridine, carboxylic acids, typically lower alkanecarboxylic acids,<br><br>
e.g. acetic acid, carboxylic acid anhydrides, typically lower alkane acid anhydrides, e.g. acetic anhydride, cyclic, linear, or branched hydrocarbons, typically cyclohexane, hexane, or isopentane, or mixtures of these solvents, e.g. aqueous solutions, unless otherwise stated in the description of the process. Such solvent mixtures may also be used in processing, for example through chromatography or distribution.<br>
The invention relates also to those forms of the process in which one starts from a compound obtainable at any stage as a transient and carries out the missing steps, or breaks off the process at any stage, or forms a starting material under the reaction conditions, or uses said starting material in the form of a reactive derivative or salt, or produces a compound obtainable by means of the process according to the invention and processes the said compound in situ. In the preferred embodiment, one starts from those starting materials which lead to the compounds described hereinabove as preferred, particularly as especially preferred, primarily preferred, and/or preferred above all.<br>
In the preferred embodiment, a compound of formula I is prepared according to or in analogy to the processes and process steps defined in the Examples.<br>
The compounds of formula I, including their salts, are also obtainable in the form of hydrates, or their crystals can include for example the solvent used for crystallization (present as solvates).<br>

Starting materials<br><br>
New starting materials and/or intermediates, as well as processes for the preparation thereof, are likewise the subject of this invention. In the preferred embodiment, such starting materials are used and reaction conditions so selected as to enable the preferred compounds to be obtained.<br>
Starting materials of the formula II, III, IVa, IVb, V, VI, VII and VIII are known, are commercially available, or can be synthesized in analogy to or according to methods that are known in the art.<br>
For example, an aniline of the formula II can be prepared from a nitro compound of the formula IX,<br>
  (IX)<br>
wherein R1f R3 to R7 and W have the meanings as given under formula I.<br>
The reduction preferably takes place in the presence of a suitable reducing agent, such as tin(ll) chloride or hydrogen in the presence of an appropriate catalyst, such as Raney nickel (then preferably the hydrogen is used under pressure, e.g. between 2 and 20 bar) or Pt02, in an appropriate solvent, e.g. an alcohol, such as methanol. The reaction temperature is preferably between 0 and 80 °C, especially 15 to 30 °C.<br>
A nitro compound of the formula IX is accessible by reaction of an acid of the formula X,<br>
^^<br>
  (X)<br>
wherein W is oxygen and R3 to R6 are as defined above, or an activated derivative thereof, is reacted with an amine of the formula XI,<br><br>
HNRiR7	(XI)<br>
wherein Ri and R7 are as defined under formula I, e.g. in the presence of a coupling agent, such as dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, at a temperature between 0 °C and 50 °C, preferably at room temperature.<br>
If required, W = O can be changed to W = S with Lawesson's agent, as described above for the analogous conversion of a compound of formula I with W = O into one with W = S.<br>
It would also be possible to first reduce the nitro compound of the formula X to the corresponding aniline compound under reaction conditions analogous to those for the reduction of nitro compounds of the formula IX and then react the resulting anilino compound with the amino compound of formula XI under analogous conditions as decribed above. However, it may then be nesessary to protect the aniline amino group.<br>
An anthranilic acid derivative of the formula VII is accesible through the reductive amination reaction of a compound of formula XII<br>
  (XII)<br>
wherein R3, R4, R5 and R6 are as defined for a compound of the formula I and Rn is lower alkyl or aryl, by first reacting the compound of formula XII with 4-pyridine-carbaldehyde and then with a reducing agent, e.g. sodium cyanotrihydrido-borate, in a one-step procedure in a lower alkanol, e.g. methanol, ethanol or propanol, at a temperature between 0 °C and 50 °C, e.g. at room temperature.<br>
The reaction sequence of first obtaining an imine starting from the amine of formula XII and then reducing it can also be accomplished in separate reaction steps. Reagents which can<br><br>
be used to add hydrogen to an imine double bond include borane in tetrahydrofuran, UAIH4l NaBH4, sodium in ethanol and hydrogen in the presence of a catalyst.<br>
All remaining starting materials of are known, capable of being prepared according to known processes, or commercially obtainable; in particular, they can be prepared using processes as described in the Examples.<br>
