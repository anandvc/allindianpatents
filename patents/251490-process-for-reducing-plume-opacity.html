				<td>PROCESS FOR REDUCING PLUME OPACITY<br>
DESCRIPTION<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
[0001] The invention relates to a process for reducing the opacity of plume released to the<br>
atmosphere from large-scale combustors, such as the type used industrially and by utilities to<br>
provide power and incinerate waste. According to the invention, plume opacity is mitigated,<br>
preferably while improving combustion and/or reducing slag and/or corrosion. The invention<br>
achieves one or more of these desired results through the use of various combinations of<br>
combustion catalysts, slag modifiers, targeted in-furnace injection, and/or in-body injection.<br>
[0002] The combustion of carbonaceous fuels, such as heavy fuel oils, coals, refinery coke,<br>
and municipal and industrial waste, typically produces a plume arising from the smoke stack<br>
and can have opacity ranging from low to high. In addition, these fuels contain slag-forming •<br>
materials, and can generate corrosive acids, and unburned carbon, that in combination have a<br>
relatively negative effect on the productivity of the boilers, and can. corrode the environment<br>
and pose a health risk.<br>
[0003] Plume is a problem from an aesthetic standpoint as well as an environmental one.<br>
Plume can be objectionable in and of itself and is expensive to treat by conventional<br>
technology. The negative effects of plume are considered to be related to the opacity of<br>
emissions from power plants. Plume opacity is measured in percent. Simply, the greater the<br>
opacity, the more the background behind the plume is obscured and the less light can come<br>
through the plume. If none of the background is obscured, then the opacity is 0%. If the entire<br>
background is obscured, then the opacity is 100%.<br>
[0004] The visibility impairment effects of power plant plumes can be grouped into three<br>
categories. The first, opacity, occurs very near the stack and is determined by EPA Reference<br>
Method 9 is found in 40 CFR Part 60, Appendix A. It was adopted as a visible emissions<br>
inspection method in an effort to standardize the training and certification of observers and to<br><br>
ensure that reliable and repeatable opacity observations could be conducted anywhere in the<br>
United States. The second, plume blight, occurs at distances from 2 km to 1 day's travel<br>
downwind. Blight happens before the plume has been dispersed so widely that it is indistinct<br>
from the background. Regional haze is the effect of the plume on a broader scale and is<br>
obviously of critical concern. Coal and 6il fired power plants, especially, produce small<br>
particles in plumes from when sulfur dioxide (SO2) is oxidized to sulfur trioxide (SO3) inside<br>
a furnace and boiler, condenses with water (H2O) at lower temperatures to become suspended<br>
sulfuric acid aerosol particles. SO3 also reacts with alkali metals to form various sulfates.<br>
Sulfate particles can significantly contribute to the concentration of very fine particle matter<br>
(PM2.5), which is associated with health as well as reduced visibility. Desulfurization, e.g.,<br>
' flue gas desulphurization (FGD), of the entire effluent can be used to decrease plume from<br>
coal-fired boilers by decreasing the overall SO2 content of the effluent. The invention, by<br>
decreasing plume opacity, directly affects opacity and is believed tp greatly reduce an<br>
individual plant contribution to the other two categories of visibility impairment<br>
[0005] While plume opacity is of concern from an external pollution position, slagging and<br>
some of the other problems caused by combustion can affect efficiency - therefore,<br>
economics, which are a severe threat to older power plants, especially, where efficiency is<br>
required for pollution controls to be affordable for maintaining the plants in operation.<br>
' Slagging deposits are sometimes extremely difficult to remove by conventional techniques<br>
such as soot blowing. Slag buildup results in a loss of heat transfer throughout the system,<br>
increases draft loss, limits gas throughput and is a factor in tube failure due to erosion from<br>
excessive sootblowing. A variety of other procedures are known for adding treatment<br>
chemicals to the fuel or into the furnace in quantities sufficient to treat all of the ash<br>
produced, in the hope-of solving the slagging problem. Typical chemicals include magnesium<br>
oxide and magnesium hydroxide for the above reasons and various combustion catalysts,<br>
such as copper, iron, calcium, to improve the burning of the fuel.<br>
[0006] Corrosion, typically occurs to a greater degree at the cold end of the combustor, and<br>
can create maintenance costs that are desirably avoided. Acid gases and deposits can often be<br>
controlled by the addition of chemicals to the combustion chamber or the fuel. The<br>
introduction of chemicals in this manner is often very inefficient and increases the amount of<br><br>
ash that must be disposed. Corrosion control is too often a choice between polluting<br>
byproducts.<br>
[0007] The art has endeavored to solve slagging and/or corrosion problems by introducing<br>
various chemicals, such as magnesium oxide or hydroxide. Magnesium hydroxide has the<br>
ability to survive the hot environment of the furnace and react with the deposit-forming<br>
compounds, raising their ash fusion temperature and thereby modifying the texture of the<br>
resulting deposits. Unfortunately, the introduction of the chemicals has been very expensive<br>
due to poor utilization of the chemicals, much simply going to waste and some reacting with<br>
hot ash that would not otherwise cause a problem. U. S. Patent No. 5,740,745 and U. S.<br>
Patent No. 5,894,806 deal with this problem, by introducing chemical in one or more stages<br>
to directly address predicted or observed slagging and/or corrosion!<br>
[0008] The presence of unburned carbon in the ash is an indication that combustion is not<br>
efficient and can cause operational problems. Increasing the amount of air used for<br>
combustion can reduce carbon in the ash, often referred to as LOI carbon (for loss on<br>
ignition, denoting a weight loss of ash due to combustion of its carbon content). This can be<br>
 effective in some situations, but the use of excess air always decreases boiler efficiency.<br>
Also, excess air increases SO2 to SO3 conversion, causing additional acid aerosol plume and<br>
may also increase NOx levels. The use of combustion catalysts can also be effective in some<br>
cases; however, combustion catalysts cannot always be used effectively or efficiently due to<br>
fuel and/or equipment limitations. Among combustion catalysts proposed in the art are the<br>
metal compounds in the form of basic metal salts, generally calcium, iron, copper and<br>
magnesium compounds. Generally the metal compounds are delivered as metal salts. The<br>
anionic portion of the salt can be hydroxyl, oxide, carbonate, borate, nitrate, etc. Carbon in<br>
the ash can decrease commercial value of the ash, which can be used in concrete if the LOI<br>
can be reduced to less than 2%.<br>
[0009] The art is in need of a process that can efficiently deal with plume, while preferably<br>
permitting efficient combustion with lower LOI carbon, lower excess air, lower CO, and/or<br>
lower NOx, and/or controlling slag, and/or corrosion.<br><br>
Brief Description of the Invention<br>
[0010] It is an object of the invention to improve the operation of large-scale combustors by<br>
efficiently mitigating plume.<br>
[0011] It is another object of the invention to improve the operation of large-scale<br>
combustors by efficiently mitigating plume, while preferably controlling slag and/or<br>
• corrosion at the same time that LOI carbon is mitigated.<br>
[0012] It is another object of the invention to enable the treatment of many boilers with an<br>
effectiveness that has heretofore escaped those skilled in the art.<br>
[0013] It is a further object of the invention to mitigate plume with reduced chemical<br>
treatment costs in many boilers and synergies in others.<br>
[0014] A yet further, but related, object is to mitigate the costs resulting from any or all of the<br>
aforementioned problems by reducing their occurrence.<br>
[0015] A yet further object is to increase combustor output.<br>
[0016] These and other objects are achieved by the present invention which provides an<br>
improved process for improving the operation of combustors, comprising: burning a<br>
carbonaceous fuel containing a combustion catalyst; determining combustion conditions<br>
within a combustor that can benefit from targeted in-furnace treatment chemical; locating<br>
introduction points on the furnace wall where introduction of targeted in-furnace treatment<br>
chemical could be accomplished; and, based on the determinations of the previous step,<br>
introducing targeted in-furnace treatment chemical.<br>
[0017] In another embodiment, the invention provides a process, which comprises: burning a<br>
carbonaceous fuel containing a combustion catalyst and a slag and/or corrosion controlling<br>
chemical; determining combustion conditions within a combustor that can benefit from<br>
targeted in-furnace treatment chemical for control of slag and/or corrosion; locating<br>
introduction points on the furnace wall where introduction of targeted in-furnace treatment<br><br>
chemical could be accomplished; and, based on the determinations of the previous step,<br>
introducing targeted in-furnace treatment chemical.,<br>
[0018] The invention also provides a process of system analysis for pollutant control.<br>
According to this aspect of the invention, the effectiveness of targeted in furnace injection, in<br>
fuel introduction and in furnace introduction of slag and/or corrosion and/or plume control<br>
chemicals are determined, as are the effectiveness of targeted in furnace injection, in fuel<br>
introduction and in furnace introduction of combustion catalysts. Then, the effectiveness of<br>
various combinations of the above treatments are determined, and a treatment regimen<br>
employing one or more of the above treatments is selected. Preferred treatment regimens will<br>
contain at least two and preferably three of the treatments.<br>
[0019] The invention has several preferred aspects, which are described in greater detail<br>
below.<br>
Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
[0020] The invention relates to a process for reducing plume, preferably while improving<br>
combustion and/or reducing slag and/or corrosion in large-scale combustors, such as of the<br>
type used industrially and by utilities to provide power and incinerate waste. The following<br>
description will illustrate the invention with reference to a power plant type boiler fired with<br>
heavy, e.g., number 6, fuel oil. It will be understood however, that any other combustor<br>
fueled with any other carbonaceous fuel and susceptible to the problems treated by the<br>
. invention could benefit from the invention. Without meaning to be limiting of the type of<br>
fuel, carbonaceous materials such as fuel oil, gas, coal, waste, including municipal and<br>
industrial, sludge, and the like, can be employed.<br>
[0021] In general, the combustion of carbonaceous fuels, such as heavy fuel oils, coal and<br>
municipal and industrial waste, result in effluents' having significant plume opacity and can<br>
cause slag formation, corrosive acids, that individually and in combination have relatively<br>
negative effect on the productivity and social acceptability of the boilers. The invention<br>
addresses these problems in a manner that is economically attractive and surprising in<br>
effectiveness. The invention provides an improved process f6r improving the operation of<br><br>
combustors. Important to the process is the determination of combustion conditions within a<br>
combustor that can affect plume. The invention can be used to treat plume alone or with one<br>
or more of LOI carbon, slagging and corrosion in the absence of treatment.<br>
 [0022] The process will entail burning a carbonaceous fuel with or without a combustion<br>
catalyst and introducing targeted in-furnace treatment chemical directed at problem areas or<br>
to locations where the chemical can do the most good. This latter step will require locating<br>
introduction points on the furnace wall where introduction of chemicals to control plume<br>
could be accomplished. The invention, thus, can be facilitated by the use of computational<br>
fluid dynamics and modeling or observation according to the teachings of U. S. Patent No.<br>
5,740,745 and U. S. Patent No. 5,894,806. In addition to the specifically identified<br>
techniques, those skilled in the art will be able to define other techniques effective for<br>
locating the problem areas and, from them, determining the best locations to introduce<br>
	chemical. The teachings of these patents will not be repeated here, but are incorporated by<br>
	reference in their entireties to explain suitable techniques effective for the invention.<br>
[0023] Among the preferred targeted in-furnace injection chemicals are combustion catalysts<br>
{e.g., potassium, barium, calcium, cerium, iron, copper, zinc, magnesium, manganese, etc)<br>
in various forms, and the oxides and hydroxides of magnesium for example, in the form of<br>
slurries or solutions in water or other suitable vehicle. The slag-reducing agent is most<br>
desirably introduced as an aqueous treatment solution, a slurry in the case of magnesium<br>
oxide or magnesium hydroxide. The concentration of the slurry will be determined as<br>
necessary to assure proper direction of the treatment solution to the desired area in the boiler.<br>
Typical concentrations vary from 1 to 100%, e.g., and are typically within the range of from<br>
about 51 to about 80% active chemical by weight of the slurry or solution, preferably from<br>
about 5 to about 30%. Other effective metal oxides and hydroxides (e.g., copper, titanium and<br>
blends) are known and can be employed. These chemicals, or others, such as copper<br>
oxychloride, copper carbonate, iron oxide, organometallics of iron, copper, calcium, supplied<br>
in a dosage to make 1 to 1000 ppm (typical 40-50 ppm) as active metal in the fuel by weight.<br>
[0024] Important to the invention and a departure from known prior art in the field, is the<br>
introduction of a combustion catalyst with the fuel or with targeted in-furnace chemical<br>
effective for improving the oxidation of the fuel, in combination with the targeted in-furnace<br><br>
treatment chemical. The combustion catalyst will be any material effective for the intended<br>
purpose and preferably comprises a metal compound wherein the metal is selected from the<br>
. group consisting of copper, iron, magnesium and calcium. It can include fuel dispersible or<br>
fuel soluble compositions. Among these, are chemical compounds which affect the<br>
combustion process, such as salts of organic acids, such as naphthenates, octoates, tallates,<br>
salts of sulfonic acids, saturated or unsaturated fatty acids, such as oleic acid, and tall oil,<br>
with metals from the group of K, Ba, Mg, Ca, Ce, Fe, Mn, Zn; rare earth metals;<br>
organometallic compounds, such as carbonyl compounds, mixed cyclopentadienyl carbonyl<br>
compounds, or aromatic complexes of the transition metals Fe or Mn. One preferred catalyst<br>
composition is calcium nitrate which can be supplied in the form 50% to 66% water solution<br>
at a dosage rate of from 1 to 1000 ppm (@ ~0.5 lb/ton or 40-50 ppm as active metal) as active<br>
metal in the fuel by weight. Variation in the amounts will be initially determined by<br>
calculation and adjusted following testing. Variations of up to 100% of the indicated values<br>
will be expected, and up to about 25% of the values will be more typical.<br>
[0025] In addition to the addition of combustion catalyst to the fuel, and a targeted in-<br>
furnace addition of chemical, the process of the invention will entail, in some preferred<br>
embodiments, the use of an in-furnace treatment chemical added to the carbonaceous fuel.<br>
The chemical can be the same or different from the targeted in-furnace injection chemical. In<br>
one scenario, total magnesium use can be about 0.6 kg per 1000 kg of fuel with 30-40%<br>
going low in the furnace or in the fuel and 60-70% going targeted higher in the furnace with<br>
targeted in-furnace injection (TIFI). The combustion catalyst is typically introduced at a<br>
dosage rate of from about 0.1 to about 2.0, e.g., about 0.2 to about 0.8, kg per 1000 kg of<br>
carbonaceous fuel burned in the combustor. In some preferred configurations, the targeted<br>
treatment chemical is introduced into the furnace- at a dosage rate of from about 0.2 to about<br>
1.2, e.g., from about 0.32 to about 0.46,'kg per 1000 kg of carbonaceous fuel burned in the<br>
combustor Variation in the amounts will be initially determined by calculation and adjusted<br>
following testing. Variations of up to 100% of the indicated values will be expected, and up<br>
to about 25% of the values will be more typical.<br>
[0026] Targeted injection of the in-furnace injection chemical will require locating<br>
introduction points on the furnace wall where introduction of targeted in-furnace treatment<br>
chemical could be accomplished. And, based on the determinations of this procedure,<br><br>
targeted in-fiirnace treatment chemical is introduced, such.as in the form of a spray. The<br>
droplets are desirably in an effective range of sizes traveling at suitable velocities and<br>
directions to be effective as can be determined by those skilled in the art. These drops interact<br>
with the flue gas and evaporate at a rate dependent on their size and trajectory and the<br>
temperatures along the trajectory. Proper spray patterns result in highly efficient chemical<br>
distributions.<br>
[0027] As described in the above-identified patents, a frequently used spray model is the PSI-<br>
' Cell model for droplet evaporation and motion, which is convenient for iterative CFD<br>
solutions of steady state processes. The PSI-Cell method uses the gas properties from the<br>
fluid dynamics calculations to predict droplet trajectories and evaporation rates from mass, <br>
momentum, and energy balances. The momentum, heat, and mass changes of the droplets are<br>
then included as source terms for the next iteration of the fluid dynamics calculations hence<br>
after enough iterations both the fluid properties and the droplet trajectories converge,to a<br>
steady solution. Sprays are treated as a series of individual droplets having different initial<br>
velocities and droplet sizes emanating from a central point.<br>
[0028] Correlations between droptet trajectory angle and the size or mass flow distribution<br>
are included, and the droplet frequency is determined from the droplet size and mass flow<br>
rate at each angle. For the purposes of this invention, the model should further predict multi<br>
component droplet behavior. The equations for the force, mass, and energy balances are<br>
supplemented with flash calculations, providing the instantaneous velocity, droplet size,<br>
temperature, and chemical composition over the lifetime of the droplet. The momentum,<br>
mass, and energy contributions of atomizing fluid are also included. The correlations for<br>
droplet size, spray angle, mass flow droplet size distributions, and droplet velocities are found<br>
from laboratory measurements using laser light scattering and the Doppler technjgues.<br>
Characteristics for many types of nozzles under various operating conditions have been<br>
determined'and are used to prescribe parameters for the CFD model calculations. When<br>
operated optimally, chemical efficiency is increased and the chances for impingement of<br>
droplets directly onto heat exchange and other equipment surfaces is greatly reduced.<br>
Average droplet sizes within the range of from 20 to 1000 microns are typical, and most<br>
typically fall within the range of from about 100 to 600 microns.<br><br>
[0029] One preferred arrangement of injectors for introducing active chemicals for reducing<br>
slag in accordance with the invention employ multiple levels of injection to best optimize the<br>
spray pattern and assure targeting the chemical to the point that it is needed. However, the<br>
invention can be carried out with a single zone, e.g., in the upper furnace, where conditions<br>
permit or physical limitations dictate. Typically, however, it is preferred to employ multiple<br>
stages, or use an additive in the fuel and the same or different one in the upper furnace. This<br>
permits both the injection of different compositions simultaneously or the introduction of<br>
compositions at different locations or with, different injectors to follow the temperature<br>
variations which follow changes in load.<br>
[0030] The total amount of the in-furnace treatment chemical introduced into the combustion<br>
gases from all points should be sufficient to obtain a reduction in plume opacity and/or<br>
corrosion and/or the rate of slag build-up and/or the frequency of clean-up: The build-up of<br>
slag results in increased pressure drop through the furnace, e.g., through the generating bank.<br>
Dosing rates can be varied to achieve long-term control of the noted parameters or at higher<br>
rates to reduce slag deposits already in place.<br>
[0031] It is a distinct advantage of the invention that plume can be well controlled at the<br>
same time as corrosion, slag LOI carbon, and/or SO3. The net effect in many cases is a<br>
synergy in operation that saves money and/or increases efficiency in terms of lower stack<br>
temperatures, cleaner air heater surfaces, lower corrosion rates in the air heaters and ducts,<br>
lower excess O2, cleaner water walls, resulting in lower furnace exit temperatures and cleaner<br>
heat transfer surfaces in the convection sections of the boiler.<br>
[0032] The process of the invention can be looked at from the unique perspective of system<br>
analysis. According to this aspect of the invention, the effectiveness of targeted in furnace<br>
. injection, in fuel introduction and in furnace introduction of slag and/or corrosion and/or<br>
plume control chemicals aredetermined, as are the effectiveness of targeted in furnace<br>
injection, in fuel introduction and in furnace introduction of combustion catalysts. Then, the<br>
effectiveness of various combinations of the above treatments are determined, and a<br>
treatment regimen employing one or more of the above treatments is selected. Preferred<br>
treatment regimens will contain at least two and preferably three of the treatments. In each<br>
case, a determination can be any evaluation whether or not assisted by computer or the<br><br>
techniques of the above-referenced patents. In addition, it may involve direct or remote<br>
observation during operation or down times. The key factor here and a departure from the<br>
prior art is that targeted injection is evaluated along with nontargeted introduction, especially<br>
of a combination of combustion catalysts and slagging and/or corrosion and/or plume control<br>
chemicals. Chemical utilization and boiler maintenance can improved as LOI carbon,<br>
slagging and/or corrosion are also controlled. <br>
[0033] The following examples are provided to further illustrate and explain the invention,<br>
without being limiting in any regard. Unless otherwise indicated, all parts and percentages are<br>
based on the weight of the composition at the particular point of reference.<br>
Example 1<br>
[0034] In this example, magnesium hydroxide was fed to the fuel oil for a residual oil fired<br>
electric power plant boiler at a rate of 0.20 kg per 1000 kg. Magnesium hydroxide was also<br>
directed into the boiler at positions determined by computational fluid dynamic modeling as<br>
described in U. S. Patent-No. 5,894,806, at a rate of 0,20 kg per 1000 kg. In addition, a<br>
calcium nitrate combustion catalyst was added to the fuel oil at a rate of 0.25 kg per 1000 kg. .<br>
The magnesium hydroxide fed the fuel oil performed two roles: it protected the lower furnace<br>
against slagging and hot-side corrosion by the mechanism of tying up vanadium in the oil.<br>
The magnesium hydroxide also prevented fouling caused by the catalyst from affecting lower<br>
furnace cleanliness. Most catalysts used for fossil fuels can also cause fouling in the lower<br>
furnace. Data showed base line opacities of 25% opacity and excess O2 levels of 1.5%-2.0%.<br>
When the invention was introduced after a CFD model was run, opacity dropped to<br>
approximately 4.0% and excess O2 was lowered to approximately 0.5%. It was observed that<br>
such operation on the unit had never been achieved before, as the fuel analysis is typically<br>
250ppm vanadium, 2.0% sulfur and 12% asphaltenes, which makes it impossible to achieve<br>
these results with in-body injection alone.<br>
Example 2<br>
[0035] A similar set as in Example 1 is run with similar treatment to reduce opacities from<br>
30% to 7%. In this case, the combustion catalyst is fed at a rate of 0.25 kg per 1000 kg of<br><br>
