				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION:<br>
The present invention relates to a negative fragrance formulation which is non toxic in nature, chemically stable and efficient. Particularly, the present invention relates to a negative fragrance formulation which can be used to deter and drive away anti-social elements from a particular area by spreading obnoxious odour without killing them.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION:<br>
Non-lethal weapon systems are important force alternatives for law enforcement and strategic defense purposes. The various non-lethal weapons that have been either developed, or are under development, include tear gases or riot control agents such as co-chloroacetophenone (CN), 2-chlorobenzylidene malononitrile (CS), Dibenz-(b,f)-l,4-oxazepine (CR); impact weapons and kinetic energy rounds like plastic and rubber bullets, high pressure water jets, flash grenades, acoustic guns, sticky foams, snare nets, stun guns, strove lights and other diversionary devices.<br>
Malodorants are foul-smelling chemical compounds that are seen as having potential use as a non-lethal weapon for controlling crowds, clearing facilities and area denials. Malodorants are chemical compounds having negative-fragrance that may be used to annoy, and drive away personnel from an area. These chemicals are generally liquids at room temperature, but expected to have a relatively high degree of volatility.<br>
Few negative fragrance formulations are reported in literature.<br>
One such formulation is given in US patent No. 5405599(1995). It is a sprayable formulation for<br>
deterring criminals, e.g. muggers, robbers, etc. The formulation consists essentially of a sprayable<br>
lachrymatory  agent,  such  as  MACE  (chloroacetophenone)  or  orthochlorobenzyle-malononitrile<br>
dissolved in N,N-dimethyl formamide or N,N-dimethyl acetamide, or the like, admixed with a minor<br>
but effective amount of a dye which is substantive for human skin and difficult to remove. The dye<br>
comprises oil of skunk (a complex mercaptan), aliphatic diamines, such as putrescine (tetra methylene<br>
diamine), or the like. The formulation is supplied in a pressurized container of the type conventionally<br>
used for containing and spraying MACE and when sprayed on an attacker repels the attacker and<br>
facilitates his identification by stain/smell.<br>
Other such formulation are given in US patent no. 6,242,489 (2001) and 6,386,113 (2002). The<br>
malodorant formulation provided by these inventions are formed from ingredients comprised of at least a malodorant compound and a carrier liquid. Preferred malodorant compounds suitable for use in these formulation include organic sulfur compounds. In addition formulation may include an appropriate amount of an odor intensifier, e.g. skatole, to provide a malodorant formulation while providing the olfactory stimuli desired. The malodorant composition is particularly effective in producing a malodorous stimulus for use in a variety of settings where non-lethal weapons are employed, all without permanently damaging the targeted subject or the surrounding environment.<br>
US Patent No. 6,242,489 (2001) discloses a large number of organo sulphur, organic nitrogen compounds, organic phosphorus compounds are covered in all these cases, the composition from these so formed must have a toxicity category rating of at least III.<br>
Another disadvantage of these known compositions is that 3-methyl indole (skatole) is one of the ingredients of these formulations, its odour may not repel all the individuals. The bad odour from soak-age pit water, latrines and grass infusions is due to the presence of skatole there. Ref: Reiter et al. reported the attraction of mosquito to hay infusions that contain 3-methylindole ( J. Amer. Mosq. Contr. Assoc, 1991, 7, 52-55). In an effort to identify systematically the environmental cues responsible for eliciting oviposition in culex mosquito, Millar et al. identified phenols and indoles in fermented Bermuda grass mixture, but attributed the most of the biological activity to 3-methyl indole alone (J. Amer. Mosq. Contr. Assoc, 1992, 8,11-17).<br>
Similarly, the butyl mercaptan is added in the in the LPG cylinders to make out any leakage during use as LPG alone is odourless. Thus in general, everyone is familiar with odour of these compounds used in the above known art and such composition is not expected to have the required repel effea in humans.<br>
US 6871595 discloses a method that psychologically alter the mental state of a target individual or audience by introducing odors to illicit memory in combination with a robust, coordinated audiovisual scheme. The odorant formulation are formed from ingredients comprised of at least an odorant compound and a carrier liquid. Preferred odorant compound includes a variety of familiar odours which provide the olfactory stimuli required to be effective. Non-lethal dissemination systems to deliver the<br>
odourant to the target individual or a group are also described.<br>
The main disadvantage of known malodorant formulations is that some chemicals mentioned may possess reactive chemical hazard with either water/oxygen. For example, the acid chloride compounds such as 2-chloropropionyl chloride, 3-chloropropionyl chloride, 3-phenylpropionyl chloride, valeryl chloride, 2 methylvaleryl chloride, isovaleryl chloride, butyryl chloride, 2-ethylbutyryl chloride, isobutyryl chloride, 4-bromobutyryl chloride, 2-ethylbytyryl chloride, isobutyryl chloride, 4-bromobutyryl chloride, 4-chlorobutyryl chloride, cyclobutane carbonyl chloride, tert-butylacetyl chloride undergoes exothermic reactions with water at the surface of the eye producing hydrochloric and organic acids irritating to the eye.<br>
Another disadvantage of known malodorant formulations is that the diluent may alter the obnoxious nature of the resulting formulations.<br>
Thus, there exists a need to develop a new negative fragrance formulation that overcomes the disadvantages/drawbacks of such formulation known in the art and is non toxic in nature, chemically stable and efficient.<br>
OBJECTIVES:<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide an effective negative fragrance formulation which can repel or annoy human beings through its obnoxious odour without killing them.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a negative fragrance formulation which can be used for invoking an emergency response against anti-social elements.<br>
Yet another objective of the present invention is to provide a negative fragrance formulation which is easy to prepare, is chemically stable, non toxic and efficient.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION:<br>
The present invention provides a negative fragrance formulation which is non toxic in nature, chemically stable and efficient and is used to deter and drive away anti-social elements from a<br>
particular place. The present invention discloses a negative fragrance formulation,  comprising<br>
essentially of alkyl thiazole and furanalkanethiole. Optionally, dl-menthol and a diluent may also be<br>
added.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, the negative fragrance formulation may be packed in a<br>
bottle or otherwise contained in a vessel for targeting an intended area using any of a multitude of<br>
delivery techniques.<br>
STATEMENT OF THE INVENTION:<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a negative fragrance formulation, comprising: (i)       alkyl thiazole; (ii)      furanalkanethiole; (iii)     optionally dl- menthol; (iv)     optionally a diluent.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION:<br>
The present invention discloses a negative fragrance formulation, comprising essential aaive ingredients such as alkyl thiazole and furanealkanethiol and optional ingredients such as dl-menthol and a diluent. Alkyl thiazole is selected from a group consisting of 2-methyl thiazole, 4-methyl thiazole, 2-ethyl thiazole, and 4-ethyl thiazole. Furanalkanethiole is selected from the group consisting of 2-furanmethanethiole, 2-furanethanethiole and 2-furanpropanethiole.<br>
The percentage composition of alkyl thiazole in the formulation is in the range of 1-20% w/w and preferably in the range of 1-5% w/w. Furanalkanethiole is used in the range of 1-20% w/w, preferably in the range of 1-5% w/w. The amount of dl-menthol used to form the formulation is in the range of 0-5%w/w. The percentage composition of diluent used in the formulation ranges from 60-95%w/w.<br>
The present invention also provides a process for preparation of the negative formulation by mixing alkyl thiazole and furanealkanethiol. Optionally dl menthol and a diluent may be added to the solution of alkyl thiazole and furanealkanethiol. DL-menthol is added to the formulation as an odour intensifier. The diluent is selected from water, isopropyl alcohol, ethyl alcohol and a mixture thereof. The formulation prepared by dissolving the constituents is then stirred well to obtain a negative fragrance<br>
formulation which is non toxic, efficient and chemically stable.<br>
The resultant negative fragrance formulation can be sprayed in emergency to repel or annoy a crowd to disburse from that area by spreading its obnoxious odour without killing them.<br>
The repel/malodorant effect is based on the concentration of two chemicals, methyl thiazole and furfuryl mercaptan. As the concentration of these chemicals increases in the formulation, the obnoxious odour also increases immensely that it can easily modify any human individual behavior to repel or annoy and to leave that place at once.<br>
These individual chemicals are tested on smelling strips and their retention period obtained by the sensory evaluation test are noted along with the type of odour and its fragrance strength. The best formulation depends on: (i)       Strength of bad odour (ii)      Retention potential of bad odour<br>
The retention of obnoxious odour of the formulation is recorded over smelling strip at room temperature initially, after 2 hrs, 4 hrs, 6 hrs, 8 hrs. and 24 hrs. are recorded. This provides the strength of each material with respect to time and to make new negative fragrance formulations. In terms of fragrance terminology, the most diffusive or the least stable chemicals which disappears after 4 hours are termed as top note materials which are generally smelled immediately after opening the container botde. The ingredients which are stable beyond 8 hours are known as base note materials and can be utilized if long lasting negative fragrance required to be formulated. Alkyl thiazole and furan alkanethiole are highly repulsive for humans and are chemically stable.<br>
As per the present studies, this formulation is found to be stable for more than one year. Since the ingredients of the formulation are stable at normal storage conditions, the formulation is expected to be stable for more than two years with retention of obnoxious odour strength.<br>
Toxicity data shows that these chemicals are safe. Further, the concentrations of the ingredients in the formulation and the probable individual exposure concentration is very low. Thus the formulation is very safe for a negative fragrance formulation.<br>
The formulation with the above combinations are found experimentally to be stable with its negative fragrance even after two years duration.<br>
This homogeneous liquid formulation can be sprayed. This formulation is easy to prepare, is stable, safe and efficient.<br>
The following examples are given by way of illustration and therefore should not be construed to limit the scope of the present invention.<br>
Example 1<br>
3gm. of 4-methyl thiazole [CAS 693-95-8], 3gm. of furfuryl mercaptan [CAS 98-02-2] and 0.5 gm. of dl-menthol [89-78-1] are dissolved in 25 ml of water and stirred well. This is further diluted with 68.5 ml of water and transferred to a bottle (plastic). The bottle is shaken well to make it uniform. This formulation can be readily used for the spreading of obnoxious odour in any place.<br>
Example 2<br>
lOgm. of 4-methyl thiazole, lOgm. of furfuryl mercaptan and 1 gm. of dl-menthol are dissolved in 25 ml of water and stirred well. This is further diluted with 54 ml of water and transferred to a bottle (plastic). The bottle is shaken well to make it uniform. This formulation is ready to be used for spreading obnoxious odour at any place.<br>
Example 3<br>
20 gm. of 4-methyl thiazole and 20 gm. of furfuryl mercaptan are dissolved in 25 ml of water and stirred well. This is further diluted with 35 ml of water and transferred to a bottle (plastic). The bottle is shaken well to make it uniform. This formulation is ready to be used for spreading obnoxious odour at any place. If required, this formulation can be further diluted with water according to human behavior/requirement.<br>
Example 4<br>
The retention of obnoxious ingredients of the formulation is recorded over a smelling strip at room temperature at various time intervals starting from t=0 hrs, t=4 hrs, t=6 hrs, t=8 hrs and at t=24 hrs.<br>
This provides the strength of each material with respect to time and to make new negative fragrance formulations.<br>
(TABLE REMOVED)<br>
Example 5<br>
The quality and stability of the ingredients in the formulation are monitored by gas chromatography and confirmed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis.<br>
Advantages:<br>
One of the main advantage of the present invention is to provide a negative fragrance formulation which is simple to prepare and retains for a long period, that a normal human dislikes its stink. The formulation modifies the human individual behavior to repel/annoy through its obnoxious odour without killing them. The formulation is easy to prepare, chemically stable, non toxic and efficient.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
