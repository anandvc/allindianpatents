				<th>Abstract</th>
				<td>The device of the present invention is useful for detoxification of aflatoxin contaminated edible oils by photolysis using sunlight of intensity greater than 300 X 10 3 Lux. The device consists of an oil reservoir fitted with conventional photo-sensor at the upper end and a solenoid one way valve at the bottom for transmitting oil to a baffle-chanelled rectangular tray made up of material such as food grade polyacrylic, aluminium or stainless steel. Wherein, the intensity of sunlight being more than 3OOxlO3 Lux units, as sensed by the said photo-sensor activates the solenoid one way valve to regulate flow of oil in the range of 20 to 30 L / H to the said baffle-channelled tray, maintaining oil thickness of 16 mm for the purpose of photolysing it by using sunlight of intensity of greater than 300 X 10 3 Lux. The tray has been channelled with baffles in order to allow the oil to flow in a zig- zag manner to provide residence time of greater than 25 minutes. The tray is also being provided with an outlet at its lower end. The oil flows through baffled channels of the tray at a predetermined residence time and is collected into the receiver. The entire assembly is mounted on a metallic or wooden support. This is a totally new and hence novel approach of photolysis of aflatoxin contaminated edible oils using sunlight of intensity greater than 300 X 10 3 Lux, as against the hitherto known prior art of refining and filtration.</td>

				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to an automatic device useful for detoxification of aflatoxin contaminated edible oils by photolysis.<br>
The device of the present invention is useful for detoxification of edible oils contaminated with aflatoxin particularly groundnut oil and coconut oil which are normally contaminated with aflatoxin. The oil so obtained by using the device of the present invention is safe for consumption and is obtained continuously. The oil so obtained retains all the aroma of the natural oil. The device of the present invention is therefore useful as a tool to detoxify groundnut oil, in particular by photolysis without reducing its aroma. Groundnut oil is produced in the country on a large scale. It is popular in India especially southern part and there is a liking for groundnut oil and is extensively used for deep fat frying, seasoning etc. The main problem of using market edible oil as such is its contamination with aflatoxin, the heat stability of aflatoxin during preparation of any food and its effects on the human health.<br>
There are a number of physical and chemical methods attempted to reduce aflatoxin levels. Reference may be made to Samarajeewa et al. (1990, J. Food Prot. 53: 489-501) wherein the authors have stated the use of heat, irradiation and adsorption as three physical factors to affect aflatoxins.<br>
Reference may be made to Mann et al. (1967, J. Agric. Food Chem. 15: 1090-<br>
1092) wherein aflatoxin is mentioned to be quite heat stable. AFB1 can be degraded in<br>
-groundnut and corn oil only at temperatures approaching 250°C.    The presence of<br>
moisture also influences the rate of degradation by heat. Mann et al. have reported that<br>
heating of meal containing 30% moisture for 2.5 h at 100°C resulted in the degradation<br><br>
of approximately 85% of toxin present. The drawbacks of this process is that the high temperatures required result in destruction of most nutrients.<br>
Reference may be made to Samarajeewa et al. wherein aflatoxins have been stated to be sensitive to ultraviolet, gamma and X-ray irradiation. The drawback of this method is that the high doses required for detoxification are not economical for routine use.<br>
Reference may be made to Salunke et al. (1987, Aflatoxin in foods and feeds. Metropoliton Book Co. (P) Ltd., New Delhi) wherein they report that oil samples can be successfully detoxified with refining, filtration and sunlight. The drawbacks of these methods are that they cannot be applied to all food commodities.<br>
Reference may be made to Samarajeewa et al (1990 J. FoodProt. Vol.53: 489-501)<br>
..wherein they state various chemical methods for aflatoxin detoxification. The drawback of<br>
the use of acids and alkalis to convert aflatoxins to less toxic compounds is the drastic<br>
conditions resulting on application which destroy the nutritional value of the food.<br>
Ammoniation and use of hydrogen peroxide are claimed to be the   best methods of<br>
-detoxification available. The drawback of this method is the amount of   hydrogen<br>
peroxide required for detoxification is too high to be   economical. Ammonia discolours<br>
the treated commodity hence is not acceptable for any food formulation.<br>
Refining and filtration by using special filter pads. In refining the oil is treated "with alkali, passed through fuller's earth and subsequently through carbon. Finally the water and oil are separated. In the second method the process of filtration is adopted. The pads used made of sodium chloride and a cloth coated with fuller's earth is inserted between the plates during the process of filtration.<br><br>
The drawbacks in the process of refining and filtration are:<br>
In refining process, aroma of the oil is completely removed; The cost of refining is very high and will enhance the final price of the oil ; There will be loss of oil during the process of refining; In the process of filtration, the filter pads are prepared and handled manually and hence involve human error; The filter pads need to be replaced very often; Removal / reduction of aflatoxin is not total; The process is labor intensive.<br>
Reference may be made to the work of Samarajeeva et al (1985, Mircen J. Appl.Micmbiol.Biotechnol, 1: 333-343) wherein coconut oil is detoxified by exposing to solar radiation, by allowing the oil to flow by gravity, adjusting the layer thickness to 
Exposure of groundnut oil contaminated with aflatoxin to sunlight (Shantha and Sreenivas Murthy, 1977, Photodestruction of aflatoxin in groundnut oil. Indian J. Technol. 18: 346-347) ensured total near total destruction of aflatoxin, which in fact has led to the present investigation.<br>
Attempts to produce a device for reducing aflatoxin in edible oils by photolysis is first of its kind. The oil millers are deprived of a suitable machine for reducing aflatoxin contamination in edible oils. In case a device is made available to the oil millers it would result in reduction of aflatoxin contamination in the oil from the market and ensure better quality of the oil. Conventionally oil seeds are crushed for the oil either in oil mills or<br><br>
ghanis. Oil mills are generally located in urban and ghanis in rural areas. Generally the lower grade variety of oilseeds are crushed for the oil. The superior quality of oil seeds is used in snack foods. Immature seeds and inferior variety/grade oilseeds carry aflatoxin and the oil expelled from them will be contaminated with aflatoxin, the level often exceeding the permissible limit (30 ppb) laid down by the Indian standards.<br>
The oil is used for deep fat frying in the preparation of traditional foods, seasoning and for salads. Since aflatoxin is heat stable, the consumer is exposed to sub standard quality of oil which would affect the consumers' health.<br>
The main object of this invention is to provide an automatic device useful for detoxification of aflatoxin contaminated edible oils by photolysis overcoming the drawbacks of the existing methods mentioned above.<br>
Another object is to provide hygienic conditions through mechanized operation. Still another object of the present invention is to reduce manual drudgery.<br>
Still another object is to provide a device capable of measuring sunlight intensity and control the flow of the oil thereby increasing the efficiency of the process and making the process environmental friendly and economical.<br>
Still another object is to provide the device, which can be installed in the oil mills to process edible oils so as to make it free of aflatoxin.<br>
The drawing accompanying this specification (figurel) represents an embodiment of the device useful for detoxification of edible oils contaminated with aflatoxin by photolysis.<br><br>
Accordingly the present invention provides an automatic device useful for detoxification of aflatoxin contaminated edible oils by photolysis, which comprises an oil reservoir (1) fitted with a conventional photo-sensor (4) at the upper end in combination with a solenoid one way valve (3) at the bottom end capable of transmitting oil to a baffle-chanelled (7) rectangular tray (2), the tray also being provided with an outlet (5) at its lower end, the entire assembly being mounted on a metallic or wooden support (6), characterized in that the said photo-sensor on sensing the intensity of sunlight being more than 300x103 Lux units is capable of activating the said solenoid one way valve to regulate flow of oil in the range of 20 to 30 L / H to the said baffle-chanelled (7) rectangular tray (2) to effect photolysis of aflatoxin contaminated edible oils.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, the baffle-chanelled (7) rectangular tray (2) is made up of material such as food grade polyacrylic, aluminium or stainless steel. This however, does not restrict the invention as any alternate material and geometrical shape can be used.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, photolysis is effected at sunlight intensity of greater than 300x 103 lux units and residence time of greater than 25 minutes.<br>
The working of the device is explained below in the examples, with particular reference to groundnut oil.<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
15 L of commercial groundnut oil is allowed to flow into the tray at the rate of 25 L/H and thickness 16 mm for the purpose of photolysing it by using sunlight of intensity of &gt; 300 X 10 3. A solenoid valve is used to regulate the flow of oil based on the intensity of sunlight. The oil flows only when the intensity of sunlight is more than 300xl03 Lux units. The oil flows through channels of the tray at a predetermined residence time and is collected into the receiver. Initial and final level of aflatoxin in the oil is given in the<br><br>
Table 1.<br>
