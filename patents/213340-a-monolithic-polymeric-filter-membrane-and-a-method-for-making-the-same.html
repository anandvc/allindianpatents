BAXTER   INTERNATIONAL  INC.,   a   Delaware   corporation,   of  One   Baxter Parkway, Deerfield, Illinois, 60015, United States of America,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention    and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br><br>
The present invention relates to a monolithic polymeric filter membrane and a method for making the same.<br>
The present invention relates generally to microporous membranes, to methods for making microporous membranes and to filtration or separation apparatus employing microporous membranes. More specifically, the present invention relates to microporous membranes of the type employing precisely dimensioned, micron-scale pores, and- to methods for making such membranes and apparatus employing such membranes.<br>
Background<br>
Filters that discriminate based on size and/or shape are well known. One type of filter, for example, provides a tortuous path through which particles must navigate to pass through the filter. These are sometimes referred to as depth filters, and typically use a filter element made of a thick bed of fiber or other material. Due to their thickness and tortuous path filtration technique, these filters sometimes require relatively high transmembrane, i.e. transfilter, pressures to facilitate flow through the filter, due to its thickness and the tortuous path filtration technique.<br>
In contrast to depth filters, another well-known type of filter employs relatively thin filter membranes, which typically have nominal pore sizes. Such membranes have been used in a wide variety of medical and industrial applications. For example, such filter membranes, with nominal pore size as low as 0.22 microns, have been used to filter bacteria and other matter from liquids, such as intravenous solutions. Such microporous<br><br><br>
