(Figure Removed)<br>
In step 1 of Scheme 1, the compound of formula (Via) is converted to the carbamate of formula (Va) by reaction with a compound of formula W-COjFli in a solvent system. The solvent system preferably contains an amine, such as triethylamine, diisopropylethylamine, or other tertiary amine. Other solvents may also be used, including dichloromethane, tetrahydrofuran, and methyltetrahydrofuran. The mixture is then cooled to approximately -80° to 25°C and the W-CO2Fl» is slowly added to control the temperature. The mixture is allowed to stir until for at least one hour, preferably, four hours or more.<br>
In step 2 of Scheme 1, the carbamate of formula (Va) is oxidized to form the oxidation product (IVa). Typically, the oxidation reaction produces a mixture of compounds having the formula (IVa).  Any suitable oxidation conditions may be used. Preferred conditions include electrochemical oxidation, such as performing the oxidation reaction in an electrolytic solution in an electric cell and electrolyzing the cell. In one embodiment, the electrolytic solution is a mixture of acetic acid and potassium acetate. In another embodiment, the electrolytic solution includes acetic anhydride. The cathode and anode may be made of any suitable material, including platinum and niobium. The mixture is then electrolyzed at an appropriate current until<br>
the reaction is substantially complete. The temperature of the electrolytic solution may be maintained at a temperature lower than 60°C, preferably lower than 40°C.<br>
The oxidation product (IVa) is heated in step 3 of Scheme 1 with a compound having the formula <crc6 including acetic anhydride to produce the enamino acetate of formula temperature is preferably maintained at about more raised>100°C, more preferably to about &gt;120°C. The mixture is allowed to stir for at least two hours, preferably 4 hours or more.<br>
In step 4 of Scheme 1, the enamino acetate (Ilia) is converted to the ketopiperidine (lla) by reaction with a compound having the formula F^OH, water or R,NH2.   Preferably, this reaction is maintained at temperatures less than 20°C, more preferably less than 5°C.<br>
In step 5 of Scheme 1, the ketopiperidine (lla) is converted to the aminopiperidine (la) by reaction with NHR2R3, N(CH3)R2R3, or N(CH2CH3)R2R3. The product of this reaction is reduced with a reducing agent to form the aminopiperidine (la). The reactions are typically conducted in a solvent, such as methanol, at ambient temperature for a time period between about 12 hours to about 18 hours. Exemplary reducing agents include borohydrides, such as sodium cyanoborohydride and sodium borohydride.<br>
In step 1 of Scheme 2, the carbamate (IVb) is formed by reacting the compound of formula (Vb) with a compound of the formula (Ri4-O-(C=O))2O or R14-O-(C=O)-X wherein X is halo. Preferably, the temperature is maintained below 0°C. The reaction is substantially complete within minutes, usually within at least an hour.<br>
In step 2 of Scheme 2, the carbamate (IVb) is hydrogenated to form the compound of formula (Ilib). The hydrogenation also may lead to cis-trans isomers. Certain catalysts may be desired for the cis:trans selectivity. Exemplary hydrogentation catalysts include PtO2, Rh/C (several types), RuO2, Rh/AI203l Ru/C (several types), Lindlar's catalyst, and Wilkinson's catalyst. Exemplary solvents include acetic acid, propanol, ethanol, methanol/ammonium hydroxide, acetonitrile, tetrahydrofuran, cyclohexane, heptanes, toluene, dimethylformamide, water. Generally, the temperature of the reaction is maintained above room temperature, preferably above 60C, and the pressure is increased above atmospheric pressure with hydrogen gas.<br>
In step 3 of Scheme 2, the compound of formula (Illb) is reacted with an aldehyde of formula R13-(C=0)-H and reduced with a reducing agent to form the compound (lib). The reactions are typically conducted in a solvent, such as methanol, at ambient temperature for a time period between about 12 hours to about 18 hours. Exemplary reducing agents include borohydrides, such as sodium cyanoborohydride and sodium borohydride. In one embodiment, the reducing agent is triacetoxyborohydride.<br>
Finally, in step 4 of Scheme 2, the compound of formula (lib) is reduced to the compound of formula (Ib). Exemplary reducing agents include lithium aluminum hydride, Vitride (Red-AI), and borane. The reduction is carried out in a solvent such as tetrahydrofuran, diethylether, or methyltetrahydrofuran, preferably at temperatures of about -10°to about 100°C for about five minutes to about 48 hours.<br>

Removal of the protecting group, wherein R is benzyl, is conducted by treating the product of the coupling reaction A or B with sodium in ammonia at a<br><br>
temperature of about -78°C for a time period between about 15 minutes to about 1 hour.<br>
Unless indicated otherwise, the pressure of each of the above reactions is not critical. Generally, the reactions are conducted at a pressure of about one to about three atmospheres, preferably at ambient pressure (about one atmosphere).<br>
The compounds of the formulas (la) and (Ib) are capable of forming a wide variety of different salts with various inorganic and organic acids.<br>
The compounds of the present invention that are basic in nature are capable of forming a wide variety of different salts with various inorganic and organic acids. Although such salts must be pharmaceutically acceptable for administration to animals, it is often desirable in practice to initially isolate the compound of the present invention from the reaction mixture as a pharmaceutically unacceptable salt and then simply convert the latter back to the free base compound by treatment with an alkaline reagent and subsequently convert the latter free base to a pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt. The acid addition salts of the base compounds of this invention are readily prepared by treating the base compound with a substantially equivalent amount of the chosen mineral or organic acid in an aqueous solvent medium or in a suitable organic solvent, such as acetone, methanol or ethanol. Upon careful evaporation of the solvent, the desired solid salt is readily obtained. The desired acid salt can also be precipitated from a solution of the free base in an organic solvent by adding to the solution an appropriate mineral or organic acid.<br>
Those compounds of the present invention that are acidic in nature, are capable of forming base salts with various pharmacologically acceptable cations. Examples of such salts include the alkali metal or alkaline-earth metal salts and particularly, the calcium, sodium and potassium salts. These salts are all prepared by conventional techniques. The chemical bases which are used as reagents to prepare the pharmaceutically acceptable base salts of this invention are those which form non-toxic base salts with the acidic compounds of the present invention. Such non-toxic base salts include those derived from such pharmacologically acceptable cations as sodium, potassium calcium and magnesium, etc. These salts can easily be prepared by treating the corresponding acidic compounds with an aqueous solution containing the desired pharmacologically acceptable cations, and then evaporating the resulting solution to dryness, preferably under reduced pressure. Alternatively, they may also be prepared by mixing lower alkanolic solutions of the<br>
acidic compounds and the desired alkali metal alkoxide together, and then evaporating the resulting solution to dryness in the same manner as before. In either case, stoichiometric quantities of reagents are preferably employed in order to ensure completeness of reaction and maximum yields of the desired final product.<br>

Inhibition of Human IL-2 Dependent T-Cell Blast Proliferation<br>
This screen measures the inhibitory effect of compounds on IL-2 dependent T-Cell blast proliferation in vitro. Since signaling through the IL-2 receptor requires JAK-3, cell active inhibitors of JAK-3 should inhibit IL-2 dependent T-Cell blast proliferation.<br>
The cells for this assay are isolated from fresh human blood. After separation of the mononuclear cells using Accuspin System-Histopaque-1077 (Sigma # A7054), primary human T-Cells are isolated by negative selection using Lympho-Kwik T (One Lambda, Inc., Cat # LK-50T). T-Cells are cultured at 1-2 x 106/ml in Media (RPMI + 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Hyclone Cat # A-1111-L) + 1% Penicillin/Streptomycin (Gibco)) and induce to proliferate by the addition of 10ug/ml PHA (Murex Diagnostics, Cat # HA 16). After 3 days at 37°C in 5% CO2, cells are washed 3 times in Media, resuspended to a density of 1-2 x 10s cells/ml in Media plus 100 Units/ml of human recombinant IL-2 (R&amp;D Systems, Cat # 202-IL). After 1 week the cells are IL-2 dependent and can be maintained for up to 3 weeks by feeding twice weekly with equal volumes of Media + 100 Units/ml of IL-2.<br>
To assay for a test compounds ability to inhibit IL-2 dependent T-Cell proliferation, IL-2 dependent cells are washed 3 times, resuspended in media and then plated (50,000 cells/well/0.1ml) in a Flat-bottom 96-well microtiter plate (Falcon # 353075). From a10 mM stock of test compound in DMSO, serial 2-fold dilutions of compound are added in triplicate wells starting at 10 uM. After one hour, 10 Units/ml of IL-2 is added to each test well. Plates are then incubated at 37°C, 5% CO2 for 72 hours. Plates are then pulsed with 3H-thymidine (0.5 uCi/well) (NEN Cat # NET-027A), and incubated an additional 18 hours. Culture plates are then harvested with a 96-well plate harvester and the amount of 3H-thymidine incorporated into proliferating cells is determined by counting on a Packard Top Count scintillation counter. Data is analyzed by plotting the % inhibition of proliferation verses the concentration of test compound. An IC50 value (uM) is determined from this plot.<br>

The aqueous mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate (3 x 250 ml), the organic layers were combined and the ethyl acetate was removed under reduced pressure. Approximately 119.0 g of a thick brown oil material 5-acetoxy-4-methyl-3,4-dihydro-2H-pyridine-1-carboxylic acid methyl ester was recovered. The TLC indicates conversion to product 5-acetoxy-4-methyl-3,4-dihydro-2H-pyridine-1-carboxylic acid methyl ester as the major component. The material was split evenly into two portions for separate hydrolysis reactions.<br>
4-Methvl-3-oxo-piperidine-1-carboxvlic acid methyl ester (hydrolysis using dimethvlamine):<br>
In a 1L flask, 60g of crude product 5-acetoxy-4-methyl-3,4-dihydro-2H-pyridine-1-carboxylic acid methyl ester was dissolved in 100 ml of MeOH and 40g (0.325mol) of 40% dimethylamine in methanol was added over 15 min at 0°C. The mixture was left to stir under nitrogen at room temperature overnight. The TLC showed product 4-Methyl-3-oxo-piperidine-1-carboxylic acid methyl ester was formed as the major component. The methanol solution was removed under reduced pressure and the residue was extracted with dichloromethane (3 X100 mL). The dichloromethane layer was washed with water (3X 50 ml) and the organic layer was separated and the solvent removed under reduced pressure. The crude residue was purified by column chromatography.<br>
The product was purified on silica gel column (360g). Elution with hexane / ethyl acetate mixture 70:30 (5L) furnished non-polar byproducts. Continued elution with the same solvent mixture (6L) followed by hexane / ethyl acetate 50:50 (3L) furnished compound 4-Methyl-3-oxo-piperidine-1-carboxylic acid methyl ester as an oil after the solvents were removed under vacuum. Yield: 11.9g (0.0696 mol, 27%), TLC (SiO2, ethyl acetate / hexane 1:1) and NMR<br>
4-Metnvl-3-oxo-Diperidine-1-carboxvlic acid methyl ester (synthesis with sodium carbonate/sodium bicarbonate Buffer):<br>
In a 1000 ml round bottom flask, 50 g of crude 5-acetoxy-4-methyl-3,4-dihydro-2H-pyridine-1-carboxylic acid methyl ester was dissolved in 200 ml of<br>
methanol. To 300 ml water was added 30 g of sodium carbonate and 30 g sodium bicarbonate (pH = 10). The aqueous buffer was added to the methanol solution. Methanol was added to the mixture until it stirred easily, and stirred at room temperature for 18 hours. The mixture was then concentrated to remove methanol. Water was added to the mixture to dissolve all salts. This was then extracted with ethyl acetate three times. The organic extracts were combined, dried over magnesium sulfate, filtered, and evaporated to furnish the crude compound 4-Methyl-3-oxo-piperidine-1-carboxylic acid methyl ester as oil, which was then purified as described below.<br>
The resulting oil was split in half, and 26.9 g was run down a silica gel column using 350 ml of silica gel. The solvent was eluted as a gradient starting at 5% ethyl acetate in hexanes. The product was eluted with 10 % ethyl acetate. Fractions showing pure product in TLC (Si02, Ethyl acetate / hexane 1:1) were combined and concentrated to afford 8.85 g (32 % yield). Further fractions showing product with minor impurities in TLC were combined and concentrated. Additional material (3.2g, 10%) slightly less pure was also isolated.<br>
The remaining half of the crude product (26.9g) was distilled in high vacuum. Fractions boiling at 99-100°C /1mm was collected. Weight 12.1 g (yield, 41%). The material compared in TLC and NMR with the sample purified by chromatography but had minor non-polar impurities according to TLC (SiO2, Ethyl acetate / hexane 1:1).<br>
4-Methvl-3-methvlamino-piperidine-1-carboxvlic acid methyl ester (synthesized with methvlamine/ sodium cvanoborohvdride)<br>
In a 100 ml round bottom flask, 4 g of impure 4-Methyl-3-oxo-piperidine-1-carboxylic acid methyl ester was dissolved in 20 ml methanol. To the stirring mixture was added 2M methylamine (25 ml in methanol solution). After 1 hour of stirring at room temperature, sodium cyanoborohydride (0.7g) was added, and stirred for 3 days. To quench the reaction, water (10 ml) was added with strong stirring, and then<br>
i<br>
concentrated HCI was slowly added until the pH was strongly acidic (pH = ~1), and remained acidic. After 2 hours, the mixture was concentrated, and the aqueous solution extracted twice with methylene chloride. The organic extracts were combined, dried over magnesium sulfate, filtered, and evaporated. The residue was run down a silica gel column with a gradient of 50 % ethyl acetate in hexane, and ending with 100% methanol. Weight of material is 600 mg. NMR (CDCI3) revealed<br>
that the desired compound 4-Methyl-3-methylamino-piperidine-1-carboxylic acid methyl ester was formed as a mixture of diastereomeric isomers. The ratio of the mixtures was approximately 1:1 from the splitting of the 4-methyl group. IR does show a C=O stretching for the carbamate.<br>
4-Methvl-3-methvlamino-piperidine-1-carboxvlic acid methyl ester (synthesized with methvlamine / sodium borohvdride)<br>
In a 50 ml round bottom flask, 2.0 g of the ketone 4-Methyl-3-oxo-piperidine-1-carboxylic acid methyl ester was dissolved in 6.0 ml of 2M methylamine in methanol. This solution was stirred for 1 hour, after which it was concentrated by rotary evaporation. In a separate 100 ml round bottom flask, 0.6 g sodium borohydride was added to 6 ml dry tetrahydrofuran under an argon atmosphere, and cooled in an ice bath. To the suspension, 3.6 ml glacial acetic acid was slowly added with stirring and continued cooling. The methylamine-ketone solution from above was diluted in absolute ethanol, and slowly added to the sodium borohydride solution with continued cooling in an ice bath. After addition was completed (ca. 1 hr), the mixture was allowed to warm to room temp. After 2 hours the flask was stored at 4 °C overnight. To the stirring solution was added 10 ml of water. After 20 minutes, concentrated hydrochloric acid was slowly added until the pH remained around 2. The mixture was then concentrated by rotary evaporation. The aqueous solution was made basic with sodium carbonate, and extracted three times with ethyl acetate. The organic layers were combined, dried over magnesium sulfate, filtered and concentrated by rotary evaporation. The oil was purified using a silica gel column with a solvent consisting of 1% ammonium hydroxide solution, 3% methanol in methylene chloride. Fractions showing the product were combined and solvent removed by rotary evaporation. Weight of product was 400 mg (18.5 % yield). TLC compares with compound 4-Methyl-3-methylamino-piperidine-1-carboxylic acid methyl ester prepared by the other route.<br>
