Method for the Preparation of Citalopram<br>
The present invention relates to a method for the preparation of the well-known antidepressant drug citalopram, l-[3-(dimethylamino)propyl]-l-(4-fluorophenyl)-l,3-<iihydro-s-isobenzofurancarbonitrile.></iihydro-s-isobenzofurancarbonitrile.>
Background of the Invention<br>
Citalopram is a well-known antidepressant drug that has now been on the market for some years and has the following structure:<br><br>
It is a selective, centrally acting serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT) reuptake inhibitor, accordingly having antidepressant activities. The antidepressant activity of the compound has been reported in several publications, eg. J. Hyttel Pr-og. Neuro-Psychopharmacol &amp; Biol Psychiat 1982, (5, 277-295 and A. Gravem, Acta Psychiati: Scand. 1987, 75, 478-486. The compound has further been disclosed to show effects in the treatment of dementia and cerebrovascular disorders, EP-A 474580.<br>
Citalopram was first disclosed in DE 2,657,013, corresponding to US 4,136,193. This patent publication describes the preparation of citalopram by one method and outlines a further method, which may be used for preparing citalopram.<br>
According to the process described, the corresponding l-(4-fluorophenyl)-l,3-dihydro-5-isobenzoforancarbonitrile is reacted with 3-(N,N-diinethylamino)propyl-chloride in the presence of methylsulfinyhnethide as condensing agent. The starting material was prepared firom the corresponding 5-bromo derivative by reaction with cuprous cyanide.<br>
According to the method, which is only outlined in general terms, citalopram may be obtained by ring closure of the compoimd:<br><br><br>
in the presence of a dehydrating agent and subsequent exchange of the 5-bromo group with cuprous cyanide. The starting material of Formula II is obtained jfrom 5-bromophthalide by two successive Grignard reactions, i.e. with 4-fluorophenyl magnesium chloride and N,N-dimethylaminopropyl magnesium chloride, respectively.<br>
A new and surprising method and an intermediate for the preparation of citalopram were described in US Patent No 4,650,884, according to which an interaiediate of the formula<br><br>
is subjected to a ring closure reaction by dehydration with strong sulfuric acid in order to obtain citalopram. The intermediate of Formula III was prepared from 5-cyanophthalide by two successive Grignard reactions, i.e. with 4-fluorophenyl magnesium halogenide and N,N-dimethylaminopropyl magnesium halogenide, respectively.<br>
Further processes are disclosed in International patent application Nos. WO 98019511, WO 98019512 and WO 98019513. WO 98019512 and WO 98019513 relate to methods wherein a 5-amino-, 5-carboxy- or 5-(sec. aminocarbonyl)phthalide is subjected to two successive Grignard reactions, ring closure and conversion of the resulting 1,3-dihydroisobenzofiiran derivative to the corresponding 5-cyano compound, i.e. citalopram. International patent appHcation No. WO 98019511 discloses a process for the manufacture of citalopram wherein a (4-substituted-2-hydroxyinethylphenyl-(4-fluorophenyl)methanol compound is subjected to ring closure and the resulting 5-substituted l-(4-fluorophenyl)-1,3-dihydroisobenzofuran converted to the corresponding 5-cyano derivative which is alkylated with a (3-dimethylamino)propylhalogenide in order to obtain citalopram.<br><br>
Finally, methods for preparing the iMividual enantiomers of citalopram are disclosed in US Patent No 4,943,590 from which it also appears that the ring closure of the intermediate of Formula HI may be carried out via a labile ester with a base.<br>
It has now, surprisingly, been found that citalopram may be manufactured by a novel favourable and safe procedure using convenient starting materials.<br>

Silica (25 g) was added, and the mixture was filtered, and the residue was washed with a 1:1 v/v solution of ethyl acetate and heptane. The filtrate was evaporated to give the title<br>
compound as a red-orange oil (2.6 g, 90%). 'H NMR (d^-DMSO): 5 4.72 (s, 2H), 5.11 (d, IH), 5.28 (d, IH), 6.17 (s, IH), 7.04 (d, IH), 7.17 (t, 2H), 7.33 (d, IH), 7.38 (dd, 2H), 7.45 (s, IH).<br><br>
Example 7<br>
5-Aminomethyl-I-(4-Fluoro-phenyl)~l,3-dihydro-isobenzofura7i<br>
A suspension of 5-bromomethyl-l-(4-fluoro-pheiiyl)-l,3-<iiliy g mmol was stirred in liquid re-distilled ammonia ml under nitrogen at></iiliy>
-33 °C for 2y2 days. The ammonia was allowed to evaporate, and the residue was stirred with a mixture of ethyl acetate and aqueous sulfuric acid (2 M), The aqueous phase was separated and was washed with ether. The aqueous phase was then basified to pH &gt; 9 using aqueous annnomum hydroxide solution (25% w/v), and was extracted with toluene. The toluene extracts were dried over anhydi'ous magnesium sulfate and evaporated to give<br>
the title compound as a yellow-orange oil (0.63 g, 40%). ^H NMR (d^-DMSO): S 3.72 (s, 2H), 5.09 (d, IH), 5.25 (dd, IH), 6.14 (s, IH), 6.96 (d, IH), 7.17 (t, 2H), 7.20 (d, IH), 7.32 (s, lH),7.36(dd,2H).<br>
Example 8<br>
Citalopram<br>
To a stirred solution of 5-aminomethyl-l-(3-dimethylamino-propyl)-l-(4-fluoro-phenyl)-1,3-dihydro-isobenzofliran (0.5 g, 1.5 mmol) in dichloromethane (10 mL) was added an aqueous solution of potassium bisulfate and sodium hydroxide (19 mL; 0.2 M in K2S20g, 3.8 mmol; 0.4 M inNaOH, 7.6 mmol), followed by an aqueous solution of nickel sulfate<br>
(1.5 roL, 40 mM, 61 |a.mol). The mixture was stirred vigorously for 4 days, and was then filtered through celite. The filtrate was partitioned between aqueous sulfuric acid (2 M) and toluene. The aqueous layer was separated, and the pH of the mixture was adjusted to &gt;9 by the addition of aqueous anrnionia solution (25% w/v). The solution was extracted with toluene, and this latter toluene extract was dried over magnesium sulfate and evaporated to give the fi:ee base of citalopram as a very pale yellow oil (0.35 g, 70%).<br>
Example 9<br>
l-(4-FluorO'phenyl)-3-oxo~l,3-dihydro-isobenzofuran'5-carboxylic acid<br>
Zinlc (38 g, 0.58 mol) was suspended in acetic acid (400 mL). The mixture was heated to<br>
60 °C. 2,4-dicarboxy-4'-fluoro-benzophenone (21 g, 0.075 mol) was added in portions of 5 gi-ams. After addition, the reaction mixture was heated at reflux temperature for two hours. The suspension was filtered while it was still hot. The filtrate was added to ice-water (1 kg) and the title compound was isolated by filtration. Yield 17.8 g (90%). 'H NMR (d^-<br>
DMSO): 5 6.84 (s, IH), 7.17 (t, 2H), 7.43 (dd, 2H), 7.59 (d, IH), 8.31 (d, IH), 8.35 (s, IH).<br><br><br><br>
WE CLAIM:<br>
L  A method for the preparation of a compound of Formula IV comprising activating the alcohol of Formula VIII<br><br>
by a substituted sulphonate or converting the alcohol into a benzylic halide or another activated derivative, followed by aminolysis to form the compound of Formula IV<br><br>
2.  The method of Claim 1, wherein the intermediate of Formula VIII is prepared by reacting the compound of Formula VII<br><br><br>
with a reducing agent followed by treatment with acid or another dehydrating agent to perform ring closure<br>
3.	The method of Claim 2, wherein the intermediate of Formula VII is prepared by<br>
alkylating the compound of Formula VI<br><br>
optionally by stepwise alkylation.<br>
4.	The method of Claim 3, wherein the intermediate of Formula VI is prepared by<br>
reacting the compound of Formula V<br><br>
with an alcohol R-OH in the presence of a dehydrating agent.<br>
5.	The method of Claim 4 wherein the intermediate of Formula V is prepared by a<br>
ring closure reaction of a compound of Formula XIII<br><br><br>
with a suitable reducing agent.<br>
6.  The method of Claim 5, wherein the reducing agent is Zn in acid, preferably acetic acid.<br><br><br></td>
