				<td>The present invention relates to n-aryloxypropanolyl-N'-phenethyl-urea compound and process thereof. The present invention particularly relates to the synthesis of N-aryloxypropanolyl-N'-phenethyl-urea derivatives of formula 3 and their use as potent appetite suppressants for treatment of obesity<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
Formula 3<br>
wherein R is selected from the group consisting of H, 2, 3 or 4-trifluoromethyl, 2, 3, or 4-chloro, 2, 3, or 4-bromo, 4-acetyl, 4-propionyl, 4-acetamido, 2,3 or 4 methoxy, 4 nitrile, 2,3 or 4-methyI, and 4 formyl and X is S or O. Background of invention<br>
Obesity is now a common disorder in the industrialized as well as in the developing countries. It is estimated that somewhere between 34 and 61 million people in the USA are obese and in much of the developing countries the incidence is increasing by sbwt 1% per year. It is responsible for various adverse effects on health being associated with an increase<br>
 in corbidity and morality from diabet3es, hypertension, cardiovascular diseases and certain<br>
 forms of cancer.<br>
 There are only two drugs currently availage fro the long term treatment of obesity in United States .One of these, sibutramine (Ryan,D.H., Kaiser,P., Bray, G.A. Obes.1995,3:553S-9S; Jones,S.P., Smith, I.G.,Kelly, F.,Gray,J.A. Int J Obes Relat Metab Disord 1995,19:41), the oniy F D A approved drug, suppresses appetite by altering norepinephrine and 5HT metabolism in the brain .The other drug, orlistat (Int J Obes Relat Metab disord 1997,21:S12-S23), reduces fat absorption by inhibiting gastric, pancreatic and other gastrointestinal lipases. The results of long-term clinical trials, extensive information of clinical effectiveness and side effects, however indicate that both of these drugs are of limited efficacy (Hill,J.O., HaupmanJ., AsndersonJ.W. Am J Clin Nutr 1999,69:1108-16; Sjostrom.L., Rissanen,A., Anderson,T. Lancet 1998,352:167-172; Davidson, M.H., Hauptman,J., DiGirolamo, M.etal, J Am Med Assoc 1999,281:235-42; Hollander, P.A.,Elbein, S.C., Hirsch, I.B.etal Diabetes Care 1998,21:1288-94; Kaiser, P.E. &amp; <br><br><br>

Advantage<br>
The pharmacological evaluation of the test compounds of general formula 3 was carried out by the following protocol.<br>
The appetite suppressant activity of test compounds was tested on scheduled fed rat model of appetite. The study was conducted in adult male Sprague Dawley<br>
rats, weighing 175-200 g on arrival). The animals were housed in transparent cages of Bayer Makrolon type 3118 measuring 425 x 266 x 180 with floor area 800 cm2. In each cage one rat was kept. A special fat rich diet (Diet # 12451, Research Diets, NJ, USA) was provided only for 3 h (11am - 2 pm) daily [no diet in rest of the period]. Water was provided for 24 h. Diet was weighed prior to and after observation period by an electronic [Digital display] balance. Food intake was recorded by calculating the difference between prior and after weight of diet. Rats were weighed weekly after feeding. Rats were provided 16 g of diet daily and within 12-14 days animals achieved base line food intake (12-14 g) with gain in body weight (230 - 250 g) indicating adaptation to scheduled feeding. Only those rats that adapted to schedule feeding were used in the study. Rat showing significant less food intake and weight gain as compared to others was excluded from the study.<br>
Thereafter, tests compounds dissolved in 10% DMSO aqueous solution and given in dose of 20 umol / kg, by oral route. The test compounds were administered 30 min prior to food. Each test compounds were given in 5 rats. Diet and water was weighed at hourly interval in control and compound treated rats. During the period of feeding the gross behavior of rat was also observed.<br>
The significance of difference between the food intake of treated and control groups was determined by unpaired Student's t test [Two tailed p value].<br>
The compound 3a, chemically, (N -[2-hydroxy-3-(4- trifluoromethylphenoxy) propyl]-N'-2-phenethyl-urea.,showed significant decrease of 41.42% in food intake as compared to food intake in the control group. The compound 3a did not cause any significant change in water intake and gross behaviour. Moreover, the decrease showed by the compound 3a was comparable with the decrease in food intake (38.57 %) caused by Sibutramine (20 umol / kg, by oral route).<br>
The compound 3j, chemically, (N -[2-hydroxy-3-(4- methoxyphenoxy) propyl]-N'-2-phenethyl-urea.,showed significant decrease of 31.82% in food intake as compared to food intake in the control group. The compound 3j did not cause any significant change in water intake and gross behaviour.<br>
The compound 3n, chemically, (N - [2-hydroxy-3-(4- trifluoromethylphenoxy) propyl]-N'-2-phenethyl-thiourea.,showed significant decrease of 28.4% in food intake as compared to food intake in the control group. The compound 3n did not cause any significant change in water intake and gross behaviour.<br>
The advantage of the present invention is that it provide a new class of compounds which are appetite suppressants and are simple than the existing standard drug sibutramine . The starting materials of the compounds of the present invention are cheap and are easily available .The process described here in simple economically feasible and ecofriendly .<br><br><br>
