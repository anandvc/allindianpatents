				<td>TITLE<br>
Method of preparation of anticancer taxanes using 3-<br>
[(substituted-2-trialkylsilyl)ethoxycarbonyl]-5-oxazolidine<br>
carboxylic acids.	<br>
The present invention relates to the process for the preparation of<br>
taxanes such as paclitaxel, docetaxel and their structural analogs using<br>
a novel oxazoiidine carboxylic acid side chain.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a novel oxazoiidine carboxylic acid<br>
and a process for its preparation. The invention further relates to a<br>
process for the preparation of paclitaxel, docetaxel and their structural<br>
analogs using such oxazoiidine carboxylic acid.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Paclitaxel is a diterpene taxane found in very low concentration in the<br>
bark of Pacific yew tree Taxus brevifoiia. Therefore, a number of<br>
semi-synthetic strategics have been developed for its synthesis from<br>
more readily available 1O-DAB. However, the taxane nucleus is<br>
highly prone to degradation and semisynthetic crude materials are<br>
often produced contaminated with structurally similar impurities,<br>
thereby necessitating elaborate purification procedure using HPLC. In<br>
view of the above facts, it becomes highly desirable to develop<br>
alternative routes for synthesis of paclitaxel which involves minimal<br>
degradation along the synthetic pathway.<br>
Any synthetic protocol for the semi-synthesis of paclitaxel/ docetaxel<br>
generally consists of<br>
a. selective acylation/protection at similarly reactive C-7 and C-10<br>
hydroxyl groups. Among the 1,7,10 and 13-hydroxyl groups in 10-<br>
DAB, the order Of reactivity is 7&gt;10&gt;13&gt;1. Therefore, selective<br>
esterification of 13-hydroxyl group requires prior protection of<br>
both 7 and iO-hydroxyl groups. Furthermore, if acetyl group is<br><br>
required in the final product, as in the case of paclitaxel, then 7-<br>
hydroxyl is to be protected first followed by acetylation of 10-<br>
hydroxyl. This requires selection of appropriate protecting groups,<br>
which can be put selectively and removed selectively under mild<br>
condition. Recently, we have explored the use of haloalkyl acid<br>
chlorides as protecting groups (US Provisional Patent Application<br>
60/311077). These haloalkonoyl groups undergo hydrolysis faster<br>
than unsubstituted alkonoyl groups and their deprotection causes<br>
minimum degradation. We have found that such haloalkyl acid<br>
chlorides specifically 2-halo/2,2-dihaloalkyl acid chlorides can be<br>
used for selective protection in taxanes and can be selectively<br>
deprotected,<br>
selective esterificatioa of 13-hydroxyI group with a suitably<br>
protected N-ben.zoylphenylisoserine. It has been found that a-<br>
hydroxy-P-amidoaryl moiety at the 13-hydroxyl of the taxane<br>
moiety is essential for its anti-cancer activity (Wani et al J Am<br>
Chem Soc 93, pp 2325, 1971). Esterification at 13-hydroxyi of<br>
taxane is very siuggisi due to its stereo-electronic disposition. It is<br>
known that the esterification step proceeds to completion with<br>
cyclic forms of a-hydroxy-p-amidoarylcarboxylic acids.<br>
Furthermore, when cyclic forms of C-13 side chain are used, no 2-<br>
epimers are obtained as side product. Therefore, new cyclic forms<br>
of side chains, which undergo facile coupling with suitably<br>
protected 10-DAB in high yield under simple reaction condition<br>
without their use in large excess, are required for developing better<br>
and more efficient alternative routes for synthesis of paclitaxel and<br>
its analogs,<br>
conversion of side chain precursor part into side chain and removal<br>
of the protecting groups from baccatin part. These reaction<br><br>
conditions should be tnild in nature to afford final material in high<br>
yield with very few side products. For successful commercial<br>
production, it is desirable that the crude semi-synthetic taxane is<br>
produced with such purity that it could easily be purified into<br>
pharmaceutical grade material.<br>
Most of the nitrogen protecting groups used so far in oxazolidine<br>
carboxylic acid require either harsh acidic condition or hydrogenolysis<br>
for their removal. Thus, eg. US Patent 5476954 to Bourzat et ai<br>
describes an oxazolidine side chain having a terf-butoxy carbonyl<br>
protecting group on the t itrogen atom. After coupling with suitably<br>
protected 10-DAB, this protecting group is removed by treating the<br>
coupled product in an acidic medium to obtain an amine which is then<br>
converted into the corresponding benzoyl derivative. Also, Mas et al<br>
in the US Patent 5616739 describes a process in which the coupled<br>
product, obtained from coupling of an oxazolidine carboxylic acid and<br>
a protected 10-DAB, is treated in an acidic medium to achieve<br>
simultaneous removal of side chain protecting groups and 10-<br>
hydroxyl protecting group. The resultant amine is then suitably<br>
protected to obtain the taxane.<br>
On the other hand, US Patent 5637723 issued to Rhone Poulenc Rorer<br>
S A in 1997 described an oxazolidine carboxylic acid, which<br>
incorporated benzoyl group as the nitrogen-protecting groupx<br>
Consequently, the coupled product obtained from the oxazolidine<br>
carboxylic acid and protected 10-DAB, upon deprotection did not<br>
require to be protected by a benzoyl group. Again this procedure<br>
requires deprotection of th; coupled product in an acidic medium.<br>
With a view to develop side chain precursor which can be processed<br>
to paclitaxei/docetaxel after coupling with suitably protected taxane<br>
under very mild and preferably neutral condition, the applicants have<br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides a process for the preparation of<br>
paclitaxel, docetaxel and their structural analogs. In this process (4R,<br>
5S)-4-phenyl-2-substituted-3-[(2-unsubstituted /substituted -2-trialkyl-<br>
silyl)ethoxycarbonyl]-l,3-oxazoIidine-5-carboxylic acids 1 is coupled<br>
with 7-0-(2-ha!oacyi)baccatin III 6c or 7,10-O-di(2-haloacyl)-10-<br>
deacetylbaccatin III 6b in the presence of a condensation agent and an<br>
activating agent in an arcmatic hydrocarbon as solvent to obtain 7-0-<br>
[2-(haloacyl)]-13-[(4S, 5R)-4-phenyl-2-substituted -3-(2-unsubsti-<br>
tuted/substituted-2-trialky lsily l)ethoxycarbonyl-l, 3-oxazolidinyl-5-<br>
carbonyl]baccatin III or 7,10-O-di-[2-(haloacyl)]-13-[(4S, 5R)-4-<br>
phenyl-2-substituted-3-(2 -unsubstitu ted/substituted-2-trialky lsily 1)<br>
ethoxycarbonyl-1, 3oxazolid.inyl-5-carbonyl]-10-baccatin III<br>
respectively. The reaction is carried out at a temperature between 0-<br>
100°C, more preferably it 40-80°C, most preferably at 60°C. Among<br>
aromatic hydrocabrons, toluene is found most suitable.<br>
Opening of the oxazolidine ring in the coupled product 7 alongwith<br>
simultaneous deprotection of the nitrogen protecting (2-<br>
trialkylsilyl)ethoxycarbonyl group was found to be structure<br><br>
dependent; the determ iniitg factor being the nitrogen-protecting group.<br>
In case of a (2-substitutec-2-trialkylsilyl)ethoxycarbonyl group eg. (2-<br>
phenyl-2-lrimethylsilyl)elhoxycarbonyl group as the nitrogen<br>
protecting group in the coupled product, the desired protection could<br>
be achieved by fluoride induced fragmentation leading to fewer side<br>
reaction. Among the sources of fluoride ion, tetraalkylammonium<br>
fluoride is preferable. The reaction is carried out by treating the<br>
coupled product 7 with two equivalents of tetraalkylammonium<br>
fluoride, preferably tetrabutylammonium fluoride in a haloalkane,<br>
preferably dichloromethane for 15-120 mins., preferably 30 mins. at<br>
0-40°C, preferably at 25oC to obtain the corresponding free amine 8.<br>
Alternatively, deprotection of (2-trialkylsilyl)ethoxycarbonyl group<br>
eg. (2-trimethylsilyl)ethoxycarbonyl group or (2-substituted-2-<br>
triaIkylsilyl)ethoxycarbonyl group eg. (2-phenyl-2-trimethyl-<br>
silyl)ethoxycarbonyl gnup, the nitrogen protecting group in the<br>
coupled product 7 can be achieved by using acidic medium. Treating<br>
coupled product 7 with 60% aqueous trifluoroacetic acid (10 times)<br>
and then mixing at a temperature between 18-25°C, preferably 22°C<br>
for 3-6h, preferably 4.5 hrs. effects deprotection alongwith desired<br>
opening of the oxazolidme ring. This is followed by usual work-up to<br>
obtain free amines 8.<br>
The yields obtained by using acidic medium to obtain free amines 8<br>
are more or less comparable to those obtained by using<br>
tetrabutylammonium fluoride. However, the latter method provides<br>
final product eg. pacbtaxel or docetaxel which are comparatively<br>
easier to purify to pharmaceutical grade material.<br>
The free amines 8 are treated with acid chlorides or acid anhydrides in<br>
the presence of a base in a heterogeneous phase to obtain<br>
intermediates 9.<br><br>
The intermediale 9, under mild alkaline condition, in the presence of<br>
ammonia or aliphatic amines or aromatic amines or their combination,<br>
preferably ammonia and pyridine (2:10) undergoes selective<br>
deprotection of 2-haloacyl groups without any appreciable<br>
degradation. The reaction is carried out at 0-5°C, preferably 2°C<br>
under stirring for 6-24h, preferably 1Oh to obtain paclitaxel or<br>
docetaxel.<br>
According to this invention is provided a process for the preparation<br>
of 4-phenyl-3-[(2-uni5ubstituted/substituted-2-trialkylsily) ethoxy-<br>
carbonyl]-2-substituted 1, 3-exazoliduine-5-carboxylic acids 1<br>
comprising<br>
i. subjecting a haloformate such as a (2-unsubstituted/substi-<br>
tuted-2-triaIkylsily)ethyl haloformate to the step of condensa-<br>
tion with arylisoerine 2 eg. phenylisoserine in the presence of a<br>
base such as alkali hydroxide or carbonate or bicarbonate or any<br>
other acid neutralising chemical;<br>
ii. converting the isoserine 3 thus obtained into the corresponding<br>
ester 4 in the presence of an alcohol, preferably methanol and<br>
an activating agent such as dicyclohexylcarbodiimide or<br>
carbonyldiimidazdle. The methyl ester 4 is alternatively<br>
prepared by condensing the intermediate 3 with diazom ethane<br>
or treating it with alkyl halide in the presence of a base such as<br>
potassium bicarbonate iu acetone,<br>
iii. converting the isoserine ester 4 into 3-[(2-<br>
uttsubstttuted/substituted-2 trialkylsilyl) ethoxycarbonylj-5-<br>
oxazoiidine carbosylic ester 5 in the presence of chemicals such<br>
as alkoxyalkane ot gem-dialkoxylkane or 1,1,1-trialkoxyaIkane.<br>
The reaction is oatalysed by p-arylsulfonic acids or their<br>
pyridinium salt,<br><br>
iv. converting the 5-oxazolidine carboxylic ester 5 into the<br>
corresponding add 1 by hydrolysis with alkali hydroxide or<br>
carbonate followed by treatment with mineral acid.<br>
The invention will now be explained in greater details with the help of<br>
the accompanying expe iments.<br>
EXPERIMENTAL<br>
Synthesis of 7-O-chloroacetyl-1O-deacetylbaccatin III (6a)<br>
A mixture of 10-deaceiylbaccatin III (250 gm, 0.46 mole), pyridine<br>
(150 gm) and 4-DMAP (5.6 gm, 46 mmol) is dissolved in<br>
dichloromethane (2.0L) The reaction mixture is stirred for 10 mins.<br>
Chloroacetylchloride (75 gm, 0.66 mole) dissolved in<br>
dichlorom eft an e (1.5L) is then slowly added to the reaction mixture at<br>
25-30°C. The whole m xture is stirred for 20 mins. and then excess<br>
reagent is decomposed by adding 100 gm ice water, and acidified with<br>
5% hydrochloric acid. The organic layer thus obtained is successively<br>
washed with aqueous sodium bicarbonate, sodium chloride solution,<br>
dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and then distilled under reduced<br>
pressure. The residue is dissolved in toluene (1.5L) at 70-80°C and<br>
then cooled down to 0 5°C. The resulting fine solid is filtered and<br>
then washed with 1000 til of hexane to obtain the pure title compound<br>
6a (250 gm, 0.40 mole, yield 87%).<br>
Synthesis of 7-O-chloroacetylbaccatin III (6c)<br>
7-O-Chloroacetyl-10-deacetylbaccatin III (250gm, 0.40 mole) is<br>
dissolved in pyridine (2.5L). The reaction mixture is cooled to 0-5°C.<br>
190gm (2.42 mole) of acetyl chloride is slowly added to the reaction<br>
mixture at 0-5°C over a period of 40-50 min. Then the resulting<br>
mixture is further stirred 0-5°C for 3 h. The excess reagent is<br>
decomposed by adding 200 ml water maintaining internal temperature<br>
0-5°C. The solvent is then removed under reduced pressure and the<br><br>
residual mass is extracted with 2.5L of ethyl acetate. The organic<br>
layer thus obtained is wasted with aqueous hydrochloric acid, sodium<br>
bicarbonate and sodium chloride solution. The organic layer is<br>
evaporated under reduced pressure. The residue is dissolved in toluene<br>
(1.5L) at 70-80°C and them cooled down to 0°C. The resulting fine<br>
solid is filtered and then washed with 800 ml of hexane to obtain the<br>
pure title compound 6c (249.1 gm, 0.376 mole, yield 94%).<br><br>
Synthesis of 7,10- di-O-chloroacelyl-10-deacetylbaccatin III (6b)<br>
A mixture of 10-deacetylbaccatin III (250 gm,0.46 mole), pyridine (300gm) and 4-<br>
DMAP (11.2 gm, 92 mmol) is dissolved in 2.0L of dichloromethane. The reaction<br>
mixture is stirred for 10 minutes.150 gm (1.33 mole) of chloroacetyl chloride dissolved in<br>
1.5 L dichlorom ethane is slowly added to the reaction mixture at 25 -30oC. Then, the<br>
whole mixture is stirred for 20 minutes. 150gm Ice water is added to decompose the<br>
excess reagent, and then the reaction mixture is acidified with 5% hydrochloric acid. The<br>
organic layer thus obtained is successively washed with aqueous sodium-bicarbonate,<br>
sodium chloride solution, dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, and then distilled under<br>
reduced pressure. The residue is d ssolved in toluene (1.5 L) at 70-80°C and then cooled<br>
down to 0-5°C. The resulting fine solid is filtered and then washed with 1000 ml of<br>
hexane to obtain of the pure title compound 6b(304.6 gm ,0.437 mole, yield 95%).<br>

temperature of the reaction mixture is raised to 50 C under stirring and then a solution of<br>
DCC (45 gm,0.22 mole) in toluene (0.2 L) is added to it. Exotherm occurs and the<br>
temperature of the reaction mixture automatically.rises to 60°C and that temperature is<br>
maintained for 30 minutes. The reaction mixture is then cooled to 25 -3Q°C, diluted with<br>
ethyl acetate (2.5 L) and kept under stirring for 15 minutes. The reaction mixture is then<br>
filtered under suction. The residue is extracted with ethyl acetate (2 x 1.0 L). The<br>
combined organic layer is washed successively with 25% ammonium chloride solution, 5<br>
