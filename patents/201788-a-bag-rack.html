				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>This  invention relates  to a bag rack  for /use particularly, though not exclusively, with scooter type^ motor vehicles, herein also called a "scooter", for the sake of brevity.<br>
Loading a scooter with shopping bags and transporting them on the vehicle is a cumbersome affair, especially when there is no convenient provision for carrying such bags on the vehicle, A makeshift arrangement, such as, suspending the bags from the handlebar is often resorted to, although this is neither desirable nor acceptable.<br>
Storage space provided in the scooter below the driver's seat is of course available; but this space is used for the storage of various other articles. Besides, transporting shopping bags, which are required to be quickly loaded on to the vehicle and as quickly unloaded, require .suitable means specifically meant for the purpose.<br>
This invention proposes such means in the form of a simple bag rack which is conveniently attachable to the<br><br>
scooter just below the seat.<br>
With the bag rack in use, shopping bags are easily suspended from the rack and as easily removed therefrom when required to be unloaded from the vehicle.<br>
The bags when suspended will be positioned behind the legs of the driver when seated. The bags will not, therefore, interfere with, or hinder, driving operations. The bags will also be safely in position until they are taken off. The bags, in their suspended position, will not cause any distraction to the driver.<br>
The rack proposed herein is not confined in its use to shopping bags alone. It is applicable to any other article as well which lends itself to be carried in a like manner.<br>
The rack proposed herein is easily installed and fastened in place by means such as screws or bolts. It has no moving parts and does not require any maintenance. It is durable and long lasting in service. Above all, it contributes to road safety, since the driver can concentrate on the traffic around him.<br><br>
As stated above, apart from scooters, the bag rack proposed herein can be used in other places also, for like purposes, for example, inside houses and offices, although it is primarily intended for use in scooters.<br>
Various other features of the bag rack proposed herein will be apparent from the following further description thereof given hereunder.<br>
The bag rack, according to this invention, comprises a stem vertically attachable to a fixture, said stem terminating in two substantially horizontal limbs disposed on either side of the stem, each limb being provided with a plurality of spaced pips on its body, for enabling bags to be suspended from each limb, in between the said pips, the respective ends of the limbs being bent upwardly.<br>
This invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings which illustrate, by way of example,  and not by way of limitation, one of various possible embodiments of the bag rack proposed herein, wherein<br><br>
Fig.l illustrates the said embodiment attached to a<br>
point below the driver's seat of the vehicle<br>
and<br>
Figs.2 and 3 illustrate front and rear views of the<br>
said embodiment<br>
The bag rack B has a stem S. With the stem in the vertical position, it is attached to a rigid fixture. In the case of the embodiment illustrated the fixture is the body of a scooter, conveniently, the place V below the driver's seat T of the vehicle.<br>
The stem S terminates in two substantially horizontal limbs LI  L2.<br>
The limbs LI and L2 are disposed on either side of the stem S, each limb being provided with a plurality of spaced pips P on its body. The bags to be carried on the rack are suspended between the pipS P at places such as those indicated by F. The pips are of sufficient height to restrict the movement of the bags hung between them.<br>
The ends of the limbs are curved upwardly at E.  These<br><br>
curved ends are intended to ensure that the suspended bags do not, in any event, slip off the limbs, when the vehicle is in motion.<br>
Preferably,  limbs LI and L2 have a varying cross-section. In the middle, the cross-section is elliptical and at the ends the cross-section is circular.  This is done in order to enable the limbs to take more load, avoid breaking and improve stiffness.<br>
The stem	S  is provided with hexagonal holes H for<br>
attaching	the stem to the vehicle by means such as<br>
hexagonal	nuts placed in the holes and tightened in<br>
place by	bolts. Other means of fastening are also<br>
possible.<br>
The embodiment illustrated is made of  tough,  durable<br>
plastic.  Other materials are also capable of being<br>
used.<br>
The stem is slightly bent away from the limbs at D so<br>
that when the stem is attached to the vehicle below the<br>
driver's seat,  the bags tend to hang a  little away<br>
from the point  at which the stem S is attached.<br><br>
The terms and expressions in this specification are of description and not of limitation, there being no intention of excluding any equivalents of the features illustrated and described, but it is understood that various other embodiments of the bag rack proposed herein are possible without departing from the scope and ambit of this invention.<br><br><br>
We Claim:<br>
1.	A bag rack comprising a stem vertically attachable<br>
to a fixture, said stem terminating in two<br>
substantially horizontal limbs disposed on either side<br>
of the stem, each limb being provided with a plurality<br>
of spaced pips on its body, for enabling bags to be<br>
suspended from each limb, in between the said pips, the<br>
respective ends  of the limbs being bent upwardly,<br>
2.	A bag rack as claimed in Claim 1 wherein the limbs have a varying cross-section.<br>
3.	A bag rack as claimed in Claim 2 wherein the cross-section of the limbs, in the middle is elliptical and at the ends is circular.<br>
4.	A bag rack as claimed in any one of  the<br>
preceding Claims wherein the stem is provided with<br>
holes for attaching the said stem to the fixture.<br>
5.	A bag rack as claimed in any one of the<br>
preceding Claims wherein the fixture is the body of a<br>
scooter.<br><br>
6.	A bag rack as claimed in Claim 5 wherein<br>
the body of the scooter is a place below the driver's<br>
seat.<br>
7.	A bag rack as claimed in any one of  the<br>
preceding Claims wherein the pips are of sufficient<br>
height to restrict the movement of the bags hung<br>
between them.<br>
8.	A bag rack as claimed in any one of the<br>
preceding Claims wherein the stem is bent away from the<br>
limbs.<br>
9.	A bag rack substantially as herein<br>
described and as  illustrated in the  accompanying<br>
drawings.<br>
