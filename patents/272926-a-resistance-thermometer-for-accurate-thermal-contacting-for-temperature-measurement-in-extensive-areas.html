Resistance thermometer<br>
The present invention concerns a resistance thermometer comprising at least<br>
one temperature-dependent electrical resistance element which has at least two<br>
connection contacts, a carrier on which the resistance element can be fixed in such a<br>
way that it can be brought into good thermal contact with an object whose temperature<br>
is to be measured, and electrical supply lines provided for connecting the electrical<br>
connection contacts of the resistance element to a measuring instrument.<br>
Corresponding resistance thermometers are known in many different<br>
configurations in the state of the art. By way of example, known in the state of the art<br>
are what are referred to as slot thermometers which are provided for detecting<br>
temperatures on or in machines and installations and for the thermal protection thereof.<br>
Such thermometers are typically fitted in slots in electric motors and generators and are<br>
generally in the structural form of a thin elongate parallelepiped of up to 1 m in length,<br>
of a width of about 5 to 15 millimetres and of a thickness or height of between typically<br>
1 and 5 mm, wherein deviations from those dimensions are readily possible.<br>
As a temperature-dependent resistance element, those known resistance<br>
thermometers include a thin platinum wire which is wound onto a bar-shaped carrier,<br>
wherein the length and diameter of such a wire are usually so selected that the<br>
resistance involves a given, fixedly predetermined resistance value such as for example<br>
100  either at 0º C or at 300 K. Such resistance thermometers are admittedly highly<br>
reliable, accurate and also temperature-resistant but they are relatively complicated and<br>
expensive to manufacture. Platinum is relatively costly as a material so that very thin<br>
platinum wires must be worked as the resistance elements, to reduce material costs.<br>
Those wires however are very difficult in terms of handling and adjustment to given,<br>
fixedly predetermined resistance values at given temperatures is also difficult,<br>
complicated and expensive. The thin wire has to be fixed on a suitable carrier in a<br>
complicated procedure and the electrical supply lines generally require an arrangement<br>
for relieving a traction loading thereon. The flexibility of such thermometers is limited<br>
 <br>
as, upon bending of the carrier, a certain tensile stress is exerted on the delicate, thin<br>
platinum wire.<br>
In addition other resistance thermometers are also known, which have for<br>
example a thin-layer resistance as the resistance element, which can also be a platinum<br>
resistance but which could also comprise other materials involving a temperature-<br>
dependent resistance, including semiconductor material, special alloys of<br>
semiconductor or metal contacts etc. It will be noted however that those resistance<br>
elements suffer from the disadvantage that they are relatively compact and can thus<br>
only implement laterally limited point measurement and they assume the ambient<br>
temperature more slowly than a thin platinum wire.<br>
In comparison with that state of the art the object of the present invention is to<br>
provide a resistance thermometer which is simple and inexpensive to produce, which<br>
permits good thermal contacting, which can be designed for the measurement of more<br>
extensive regions and which can be used, at least for simple situations of use, in the<br>
same or similar manner to the more complicated and expensive thermometers which are<br>
equipped with platinum wire as the resistance element.<br>
That object is attained in that the carrier is a plastic material which is easily<br>
bendable in at least one direction and in which at least two electrical conductor tracks<br>
are embedded, wherein a prefabricated resistance having at least two electrical<br>
connection contacts is used as the resistance element.<br>
In that respect, in the sense of the present invention, the term "embedded" is<br>
also intended to denote conductor tracks which are disposed in surface relationship on a<br>
plastic carrier material, for example which are applied in the form of a layer, in which<br>
respect it will be appreciated that it is preferable for the conductor tracks to be enclosed<br>
by the plastic material on at least three sides and in particular on all four sides.<br>
In accordance with the invention therefore the carrier on which a resistance<br>
element is fixed in such a way that it can be brought into good thermal contact with the<br>
measurement environment is provided with integrated conductor tracks, wherein<br>
moreover the carrier is a plastic material which is easily bendable in at least one<br>
direction. It will be appreciated that the carrier is accordingly also easily bendable in<br>
one direction together with the electrical conductor tracks embedded therein, and can<br>
thus be very easily and simply adapted to the geometry of given objects to be measured.<br>
 <br>
The integrated configuration of the carrier and the electrical supply lines<br>
facilitates the procedure involved in fixing and contacting the resistance element as,<br>
instead of the previous three elements, namely the resistance element, the carrier and<br>
the supply lines which had to be jointly brought together and fixed to each other, now<br>
there are only two elements which are to be fixed to each other as the carrier and the<br>
conductor tracks are of an integrated nature.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention the plastic material in which the<br>
conductor tracks are embedded or on which they are integrally disposed is an<br>
extrudable, temperature-resistant thermoplastic material such as for example a<br>
polyimide, in particular polyamideimide or a polyetherketone such as for example<br>
PEEK. PTFE is also suitable as the plastic carrier material. The plastic material should<br>
be heat-resistant to up to at least 180°C, preferably up to at least 200°C or above.<br>
The connection contacts of the electrical resistance element are easily connected<br>
or contacted to the at least two conductor tracks, for example by soldering, welding, or<br>
similar contacting procedures and are then automatically also at least provisionally<br>
fixed to the carrier.<br>
The integrated conductor tracks in turn have good thermal conductivity and, by<br>
way of the flexible carrier, can be easily brought into good thermal contact with the<br>
object whose temperature is to be determined, and they thus contribute to effectively<br>
transmitting to the resistance element, the temperature of a region which extends<br>
beyond the dimensions of the resistance element.<br>
The features of preferred embodiments of the invention, which are described<br>
hereinafter in part in conjunction with each other, are each to be considered as being<br>
disclosed individually and separately in themselves and can be combined with all other<br>
features in any combinations, insofar as a feature does not necessarily presuppose<br>
another feature or represents a more concrete form of another feature.<br>
In the preferred embodiment the carrier is a plastic material in strip form of a<br>
cross-section whose width is at least double, preferably at least four times and still<br>
more preferably at least six times or particularly preferably even more than eight times<br>
the height of the material in strip form. In that case, in relation to a non-circular cross-<br>
section for the material in strip form, the greatest cross-sectional extent is referred to<br>
here as the "width" and the dimension of the shortest extent is referred to as the<br>
 <br>
"height". Desirably such a strip is of a width of at least 3 mm, preferably at least 5 mm.<br>
Elements in strip form which have been subjected to practical testing in preliminary<br>
investigations were for example of a width of the order of magnitude of 6 to 9 mm. In<br>
the preferred embodiment the maximum width is 25 mm, wherein maximum widths of<br>
20 mm or 15 mm are still more preferred and particularly preferably the total width is<br>
below 12 mm. In specific terms, minimum widths of 6 mm or less can be achieved<br>
where that is required. The height or thickness of the carrier including the embedded<br>
electrical conductor tracks should preferably not be below 0.2 mm and is preferably at<br>
least 0.4 mm to be able to ensure sufficient thickness both of the conductor tracks and<br>
also the insulating carrier layers. The maximum height or thickness should if possible<br>
not exceed 3 mm, better 2 mm.<br>
The cross-sectional dimensions of the carrier overall determine the maximum<br>
possible cross-section of the conductor tracks. On the one hand there must be at least<br>
two electrical conductor tracks to be able to contact the at least two connection contacts<br>
of a resistance element, in order to measure therebetween the resistance of the<br>
resistance element. In addition those conductor tracks must be insulated from each<br>
other and they are preferably also insulated with respect to the environment by the<br>
carrier element and are preferably enclosed on all sides by the carrier element, wherein<br>
the carrier element is removed on one side of those conductor tracks only in the regions<br>
in which the connection contacts of the resistance element must be connected to the<br>
conductor tracks.<br>
In addition the electrical conductor tracks which are generally also good thermal<br>
conductors serve for thermally connecting the electrical resistance element to the<br>
environment to be measured, over a greater region which is adjacent to the resistance<br>
element, whereas the plastic material of the carrier is generally a poor conductor of<br>
heat, that is to say it was only intended to cover the electrical conductor tracks with a<br>
thin layer insofar as it is required for the desired insulation and also for mechanical<br>
integrity of the carrier. In addition the electrical conductor tracks overall were to<br>
involve a relatively low level of resistance as, at least in the case of a two-wire<br>
measurement operation, the resistance of the supply lines is also measured in addition<br>
to the resistance of the resistance element and as the resistance of the supply lines is<br>
also generally temperature-dependent, which makes the measurement correspondingly<br>
 <br>
less accurate or requires additional corrections which can be correspondingly more<br>
disregarded, the lower the absolute resistance of the supply lines in relation to the<br>
resistance of the resistance element. The endeavour is therefore to make the cross-<br>
section of the conductor tracks sufficiently great and the cross-section of the carrier<br>
material enclosing the conductor tracks as small as possible, that is to say insofar as that<br>
is compatible with the insulation requirements and the mechanical demands as a carrier.<br>
For that reason the cross-section of the individual conductor track should not be<br>
less than a given minimum dimension and is preferably at least 0.1 and still more<br>
preferably 0.2 or indeed 0.3 mm2. On the other hand the cross-section both of the<br>
carrier material and also of the conductor tracks should not be excessively great,<br>
because that limits the bendability and mobility of the carrier. Good flexibility in at<br>
least one plane is achieved however inter alia by the above-mentioned preferred<br>
relationships between the width and the height of the cross-section.<br>
In the preferred embodiment of the invention the carrier material and the<br>
conductor tracks are rectangular in cross-section, the long sides of those cross-sections<br>
extending in parallel relationship with each other. The conductor tracks preferably<br>
comprise copper as copper is both a good thermal conductor and also a good electrical<br>
conductor and in addition is comparatively inexpensive.<br>
The carrier material is preferably produced with a constant cross-section, in the<br>
form of an endless material, and is cut to length as may be desired, in the lengths<br>
required for specific thermometers. It will be appreciated that the same consideration<br>
preferably also applies to the conductor tracks which are integrated into the carrier<br>
material.<br>
For many purposes of use it is desirable if the temperature is detected over a<br>
prolonged measurement distance or if a longer portion of an object whose temperature<br>
is to be determined is detected, which cannot be readily bridged over by the heat-<br>
conducting conductor tracks. For such a purpose it is provided in accordance with the<br>
invention that a plurality of resistance elements are distributed over a carrier portion of<br>
corresponding length, preferably at equal spacings. The resistance elements used are<br>
preferably thin-layer resistances, in particular PT thin-layer resistances, which are<br>
relatively inexpensive in comparison with platinum wires. In that case, a plurality of<br>
such resistances which are distributed over the length of the carrier portion can be<br>
 <br>
connected in parallel. It will be noted however that it is also possible for a plurality of<br>
resistances to be connected in series in succession on a single conductor track, by that<br>
conductor track being respectively interrupted between the two connection legs, which<br>
are contacted in succession with the conductor track, of each of the resistances.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention the carrier material has at least three<br>
conductor tracks, which makes it possible for a plurality of resistances arranged thereon<br>
to be selectively connected in parallel or in series. In particular, with at least three<br>
resistances, two of those resistances can be connected in series and a third can be<br>
connected in parallel with the two or in parallel with one of the series-connected<br>
resistances. With four resistances it is for example possible for two resistances to be<br>
connected in parallel in pairs in each case and for those parallel-connected pairs to be<br>
connected in turn in series in succession, or vice-versa. If in such a situation four<br>
nominally identical resistances are used, that combined parallel and series connection<br>
also has the same resistance value as each individual resistance, wherein, when using<br>
resistances involving tolerance, the resistances can be measured prior to contacting and<br>
can be arranged in the series and parallel circuit in accordance with the specific<br>
tolerance deviations found, so that the overall resistance of the interconnected<br>
resistances has a lower tolerance deviation from the reference or target value than one<br>
or other of the individual resistances.<br>
The connection contacts or connection wires of the resistance elements,<br>
particularly in the case of thin-layer resistances, contribute to the resistance value, in<br>
which respect the lengths of those connection contacts or contact wires can be so<br>
adapted, that is to say shortened, that as a result the resistance of the conductor tracks<br>
can be compensated and also any tolerance deviations can be reduced.<br>
A further advantage of using at least three conductor tracks is that it is possible<br>
to provide a third measurement tapping on the third conductor track so that it is<br>
possible for a respective one of the series-connected groups of parallel resistors to be<br>
measured separately by a procedure whereby the third measurement tapping is used<br>
instead of a respective one of the other two, minimally present measurement tappings.<br>
That permits additional differentiation and positional resolution of the measured<br>
temperature if the resistance elements are arranged group-wise in succession along the<br>
 <br>
thermometer section (wherein the resistance elements of a group are respectively<br>
connected in parallel).<br>
In the preferred embodiment of the present invention in which the carrier for<br>
example is of a width of about 6 or at a maximum 8 mm, a thickness of less than 1 mm<br>
and for example has three embedded flat conductor tracks of cross-sections of each 1.5<br>
x 0.2 mm2, applying resistance elements to one of the longer cross-sectional sides of the<br>
carrier makes it possible to manufacture thermometers whose maximum thickness is<br>
between 2 and 4 mm while the width approximately corresponds to the width of the<br>
carrier and the length of the carrier and thus of the thermometer can be selected as<br>
desired to correspond to the purpose of use. When using a single resistance element<br>
typical overall lengths of such a resistance thermometer are for example 50 mm while<br>
when using a plurality of resistance elements overall lengths of up to 1 mm or also<br>
thereabove are readily possible. The spacing of adjacent resistance elements should<br>
preferably be not more than 10 cm.<br>
Preferably the electrical thin-layer resistances are applied flat to the flat top side<br>
of the carrier, the connection contacts are contacted with two of the embedded flat<br>
conductors and then the carrier with the resistance which is placed flat thereon or which<br>
is pressed flat thereon in specifically targeted fashion can be cast around for example<br>
with silicone. Preferably all resistance elements are applied on only one side of the<br>
carrier although for many purposes of use an alternate arrangement or an arrangement<br>
which changes in accordance with another scheme, on both sides of the carrier, can also<br>
be appropriate. The carrier material is preferably heat-resistant and flexible so that it<br>
can be fitted into narrow slots or gaps in a machine and for example can also be placed<br>
around curved or cylindrical parts of a machine or other objects to be measured,<br>
wherein the resistance elements are brought into good contact with the surface of the<br>
object to be measured, even if only the side of the carrier, that is remote from the<br>
applied resistances, can be brought into direct contact with the object to be measured.<br>
The conductor tracks and the relatively thin insulating layer on the conductor tracks, as<br>
well as the flat cross-sectional shape of the carrier and the conductor tracks, then<br>
always still provide for relatively good thermal contact between the object to be<br>
measured and the resistance element.<br>
 <br>
Preferably the carrier with the resistance or resistances which is enclosed by<br>
casting with silicone and/or a heat-conducting paste is also encased with a shrink tube<br>
extending over the entire length of the carrier. The carrier can additionally be<br>
embedded into a suitable plastic housing or at least an end portion thereof, or can be<br>
connected to an end portion which accommodates external supply lines connected to<br>
the electrical conductor tracks of the carrier, for example being soldered or welded or<br>
bonded thereto, wherein an end of the carrier material in question is supported at the<br>
end portion which thus serves as a means for relieving traction loadings thereon when<br>
the supply lines are fixed thereto.<br>
A particular advantage is that, in the preferred variant of the present invention,<br>
the carrier material with the embedded conductor tracks is produced in a constant cross-<br>
section, in the form of endless material. The carrier can thus be easily adapted to any<br>
desired length, it guarantees good thermal coupling of the resistance elements and at the<br>
same time it is very inexpensive.<br>
Further advantages, features and possible uses of the present invention will be<br>
clearly apparent from the description hereinafter of a preferred embodiment and the<br>
accompanying drawings in which:<br>
Figure 1 shows a plan view of a resistance thermometer according to the<br>
invention, wherein a covering shrink tube and the silicone casting material are shown as<br>
being removed from the surface,<br>
Figure 2 shows a portion from Figure 1 on an enlarged scale,<br>
Figure 3 shows a cross-section along line A-A in Figure 2 but without the<br>
housing 15, and<br>
Figure 4 shows a cross-section through a carrier material according to the<br>
invention with partially removed insulation of two conductor tracks.<br>
As can be seen from Figure 4 the carrier 3 of the resistance thermometer which<br>
is generally identified by reference 10 comprises a plastic strip which is rectangular in<br>
cross-section, with three flat conductors which are also rectangular in cross-section and<br>
which are denoted by references 2a, 2b and 2c. The height of the carrier material is for<br>
example 0.5 to 0.8 mm and the width is between 6 and 8 mm. The cross-section of the<br>
individual conductor tracks 2a, 2b and 2c is for example 0.2 mm x 1.5 mm, that is to<br>
say about 0.3 mm2. The spacing of adjacent conductor tracks is for example about 0.2<br>
 <br>
to 0.5 mm and the thickness of the insulating layer on the upper and lower long sides of<br>
the cross-section is preferably 0.1 to 0.3 mm but can also be thicker when extreme<br>
demands are made in terms of high-voltage dielectric strength. The outer lateral<br>
insulations along the longitudinal edges of the carrier 3 should also be at least 0.1 to 0.5<br>
mm or more. The insulating limbs 6 between the conductor tracks are preferably of a<br>
width of at least 0.2, preferably at least 0.5 mm. In the illustrated version the insulating<br>
limbs 6 are almost 0.5 mm wide. The plastic material is insulating and flexible and<br>
very easily bendable about an axis parallel to the longitudinal side of the cross-section.<br>
In Figure 4 the plastic material 6 is removed on the top side from two of the conductor<br>
tracks 2b, 2c in order there to be able to contact a resistance element 1 or the<br>
connection contacts 8 thereof, as shown in Figure 3. It is also possible to see solder<br>
beads 12 with which the connection contacts 8 are electrically connected to the<br>
conductor tracks 2b, 2c. It is also possible to see a heat-conducting paste 13, by means<br>
of which the actual resistance element 1 which has a PT thin-layer resistance is fixed on<br>
the surface of the carrier 3 and in good surface contact in relation to the surface of the<br>
carrier 3. The resistance element 1 is only separated from the subjacent conductor<br>
tracks 2b, 2c by a relatively thin layer of the insulating material so that the conductor<br>
tracks 2b, 2c can transport heat out of regions which are adjacent to the resistance<br>
element 1 to the resistance element 1 or can conduct excess heat therefrom. Optionally<br>
the resistance thermometer can be brought into contact with the object whose<br>
temperature is to be measured, either with the rear side which is opposite the resistance<br>
element or however with the side on which the resistance element 1 is disposed.<br>
Optionally the resistance thermometer can also be fitted into a groove in the object in<br>
question and can be clamped or cast therein so that heat transfer to the resistance<br>
element 1 can take place from both sides.<br>
Figure 1 shows the resistance thermometer which is generally identified by<br>
reference 10 and which in principle can be produced in any length as the carrier 3 is an<br>
endless material which is cut to length in accordance with the specific requirement for a<br>
thermometer. In the present example in Figure 1 which shows a resistance<br>
thermometer almost in its natural size or on a slightly increased scale the carrier 3 has<br>
three parallel conductor tracks 2a, 2b and 2c of constant cross-section, which extend<br>
over the entire length of the carrier 3 and with which a total of four resistance elements<br>
 <br>
1 are contacted. Shown at the right-hand end are two electrical supply lines 5 which<br>
are in contact with the two outer conductor tracks 2a and 2c. The resistances 1a, 1b and<br>
1c and 1d are connected in parallel in pairs between the lines 2b, 2c and 2a, 2b<br>
respectively and, by virtue of the connection to the central conductor track 2b which is<br>
not in direct contact with the outer supply lines 5, effectively have a series connection<br>
of the two pairs shown at the right and the left respectively. The resistances however<br>
can equally well be arranged in such a way that a resistor is connected alternately to the<br>
conductor tracks 2b, 2c and 2a and 2b respectively, which in this embodiment would<br>
not in any way alter the effective parallel and series connection. It would also be<br>
possible for all resistances to be connected in parallel, in which case only two<br>
conductor tracks would be required, and the outer connecting lines 5 could either<br>
contact the conductor tracks 2a and 2b or 2b and 2c, instead of the conductor tracks 2a<br>
and 2c as shown here.<br>
As already mentioned the resistances can also be connected in series, in which<br>
case then, if the number of the resistances is equal to or greater than the number of<br>
available conductor tracks, the series connection can be implemented inter alia by at<br>
least a portion of the resistances being contact with both respective connections on the<br>
same conductor track, with the conductor track being interrupted between the<br>
connections of the resistance in question. In order to implement a series connection<br>
with the carrier material according to the invention however it is alternatively also<br>
possible for the two connections of each of the resistances to be respectively connected<br>
to another conductor track if a respective one of the conductor tracks is alternately<br>
interrupted between successive resistances. It is then advantageously possible to use a<br>
third conductor track as the return conductor in order to have all connections of the<br>
thermometer jointly at one end of the carrier.<br>
The length of the electrical connection wires 8 which make up a part of the<br>
measurement resistance is suitably adapted to possibly compensate for the supply line<br>
resistance of the supply lines and the conductor tracks 2a, 2b and 2c respectively. In<br>
other words the connection wires 8 of the resistance elements (for example la) which<br>
are further away from the outer connection cables 5 or the outer connection contacts 4<br>
respectively can be shortened more greatly than the resistance elements (for example<br>
1d) which are closer to the cables 5. The outer supply lines or connection cables 5 can<br>
 <br>
in particular also have double the number (that is to say 4) of electrical conductors in<br>
order to go over to 4-point measurement of the resistance as closely as possible to the<br>
conductor tracks 2a, 2b, 2c. In the illustrated combined series and parallel connection<br>
of the four resistances and on the assumption that all four resistances are of the same<br>
nominal value, the totality of the four resistance elements 1 connected in that fashion<br>
also have the same nominal value as each individual resistance. As already mentioned,<br>
by means of a skilful combination of the individual resistances which can each in itself<br>
have certain tolerance deviations, it then becomes possible in comparison to reduce the<br>
tolerance deviation of the combined resistance. The maximum number of resistance<br>
elements 1 on a carrier 3 is not limited and depends only on the space available on a<br>
given carrier portion, in which respect however there is generally no need for the<br>
resistance elements to be arranged at a very close spacing as in any case a certain<br>
temperature detection is achieved over a relatively large region which amounts to a<br>
multiple of the thermal contact surface of the individual resistance element 1, by way of<br>
the conductor tracks but also by way of any adjacent machine components or the like.<br>
As can also be seen from Figure 3 the resistance elements 1 are substantially fiat<br>
parallelepipedic elements, the width of which at any event is less than the width of the<br>
carrier 3 and the thickness of which is preferably less than 1 mm, for example 0.9 mm.<br>
For good thermal contact, the external contact surfaces of the thin-layer resistances<br>
should preferably be at least 2 mm2, preferably at least 3 to 4 mm2.<br>
The carrier 3 with the applied and contacted resistance elements 1a, 1b, 1c, 1d<br>
can possibly either be restricted to the individual resistance elements or it can be<br>
encased by casting over its entire length with a heat-contacting paste 13, a silicone<br>
adhesive or another protective and binding material so that the finished resistance<br>
thermometer is then overall of a thickness which is scarcely more than the total of the<br>
thickness of the carrier 3 and one of the resistance elements 1. Finally the entire carrier<br>
with the resistance elements cast therein can also be encased in a shrink tube 14 or in a<br>
preferably thin-walled, insulating housing, wherein Figure 1 also shows the shrink tube<br>
version at the upper and lower edges of the carrier 3 and at the left-hand and right-hand<br>
ends of the thermometer 10. It is also possible to provide a housing in the form of a<br>
non-insulating housing, for example comprising a soft or thin-walled metal material<br>
which is pressed to the carrier and the resistances and which ensures good temperature<br>
 <br>
distribution and thermal contact in relation to the resistance elements, which however<br>
presupposes that the conductor tracks and the resistance elements are well insulated in<br>
relation to the housing. That could be ensured for example by the combination of an<br>
inner insulating shrink tube and an outer metal housing surrounding the shrink tube.<br>
Figure 2 shows an enlargement of the right-hand end of the resistance<br>
thermometer 10 but with a modification insofar as the shrink tube 14 of Figure 1 is<br>
replaced by a housing 15 which however can also be provided in addition to a shrink<br>
tube 14. The housing 15 is also a flat housing of rectangular cross-section, with an<br>
opening which fairly precisely corresponds to the width and height of the carrier<br>
material, possibly additionally with the resistance elements 1 cast therein. The end 9,<br>
which can be seen at the right, of the carrier 3 is supported against the right-hand end of<br>
the corresponding opening in the housing 15 and the supply lines 5 are passed through<br>
two gaps or bores in the right-hand end of the housing 15 and contacted with the tracks<br>
2a and 2c. Because the end 9 of the carrier 3 is supported in the housing that<br>
effectively forms a mean for relieving traction loadings on the connection wires or<br>
cables 5 which can also be fixed in the housing, although that is not shown here. The<br>
housing can also be only in the form of a short end portion which receives only a short<br>
end part of the thermometer 10, which only includes for example the connection<br>
contacts for the supply lines 5. That avoids the housing 15 adversely affecting the<br>
thermal contact of the most closely adjacent resistance element 1 with the surroundings.<br>
Each of the cables 5 can have two connection wires which are insulated relative to each<br>
other and which for the purposes of 4-point measurement are jointly connected to the<br>
contact locations 4.<br>
Alternatively the housing 15 can also comprise a metal, preferably a soft metal<br>
and in particular a metal foil or a metal braid or mesh and can be pressed to the<br>
resistance thermometer for good thermal contact, in which case then however the<br>
thermometer 10 must be insulated in relation to the housing 15, for example by a shrink<br>
tube 14 within the housing 15.<br>
The resistance thermometers according to the invention are relatively simple<br>
and inexpensive to produce, they are extremely flexible in the preferred variant and<br>
they are therefore suitable for very many different purposes of use.<br>
