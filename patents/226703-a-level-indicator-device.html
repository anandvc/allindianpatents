				<td>This  invention  relates to a  level  indicator cum for use with the tanks  for maintaining the  level of the  liquid such as water or  any other liquid material contained  in the tanks.<br>
The level indicator is as such known in the art and comprises a pair of electrodes adapted to be disposed in the tank in wherein the level of the liquid is to toe determined. The outer ends of the electrodes are connected to a d.c. amplifier which is connected to an output state provided for supplying current/signals to the visual/ audio indication means. Similarly in the automatic level controllers the output stage is further connected to an activating switch provided to switch-on and switch off the motor so as to maintain the water level in the tank. This device works on the conductivity principle.<br>
There are disadvantages associated with the conventional device. One of the main disadvantage is that during the operation of the device the continuous flow of electric current is required between the level sensing electrodes through the liquid/water. As the electrodes have potential difference the<br>
chemical effects takes place and therefore, the electrodes are coated with electrically insulating deposits. In some cases, the electrodes are completely dissolved in the liquid/water over a period of time.<br>
Another disadvantage is that the electrodes have to be serviced every 2 or 3 months of the operation of the device. In some cases, the electrodes have to be replaced.<br>
Still another disadvantage is that the operational life of the device is very small and therefore prevents the under application of the device commercially.<br>
Therefore, the main object of this invention is to provide a level indicator cum-controller device which obviates the disadvantage associated with the prior art.<br>
Another object of this invention is to provide a level indicator cum-controller device wherein the flow of electric current in the liquid is required periodically.<br>
Yet another object of this invention is that the operational life of the device is substantially increased as the harmful depositional on the electrodes have been minimized.<br>
According to this invention there is provided a level indicator device comprising of plurality of electrodes provided to be disposed at: different heights in a container, containing liquid the outer ends of the said electrodes are connected to a d.c amplifier characterized in the said d.c. amplifier connected to the control system provided to supply peroidic current to said electrodes so as to collect water level data and stored in memory and to control system having a transistor capacitor (c), a diode and a pair of resistance to provide on or switch off to maintain the level of the liquid in the container, the input of an integrated circuit (IC-2) 4011 to indicate level control and the outputs of (IC2) 4011 are connected with the resistances (R).<br>
In accordance with this invention a plurality of electrodes are disposed into the container at the different heights to measure the level of the liquid in the container. Specifically in accordance with that invention electronic control means are provided to collect the water lever data periodically by supplying current to the electrodes, and<br>
to store the data in the memory. The water level data collection rate is vet to its lowest possible value appropriate for a given system application. The memory circuit is reset and readied for receiving fresh data as soon as a level data collection cycle commences. Thus, the continuous flow of the electric current required in the conventional level indicator has been avoided.<br>
