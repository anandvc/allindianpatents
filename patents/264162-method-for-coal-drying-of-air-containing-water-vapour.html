Improved method for cool drying.<br>
The present invention concerns an improved method for cool<br>
drying.<br>
In particular, the present invention concerns a method for<br>
cool drying gas, in particular air, containing water<br>
vapour, whereby this gas is guided through the secondary<br>
part of a heat exchanger whose primary part is the<br>
vaporizer of a cooling circuit which also comprises a<br>
compressor which is driven by a motor; a condenser; an<br>
expansion means between the outlet of the condenser and<br>
the inlet of the above-mentioned vaporizer.<br>
Such methods are used among others for drying compressed<br>
air.<br>
Compressed air which is supplied for example by a<br>
compressor is in most cases saturated with water vapour<br>
or, in other words, has a relative humidity of 100%. This<br>
means that in case of a temperature drop below what is<br>
called the dew point, there will be condensation. The<br>
condensed water gives rise to corrosion in pipes and<br>
tools, and appliances xnay wear prematurely.<br>
That is why compressed air is dried, which may be done in<br><br>
WO 2006/133522	PCT/BE2006/000041<br>
2<br>
the above-mentioned manner by means of cool drying.<br>
Also other air than compressed air or other gases may be<br>
dried in this manner.<br>
Cool drying is based on the principle that by lowering<br>
the air or gas temperature in the vaporizer, moisture<br>
in the air or gas will condense, after which the<br>
condensed water is separated in a liquid separator and<br>
after which the air or gas is heated again, such that<br>
this air or gas will be no longer saturated.<br>
The same applies to any other gas than air, and each time<br>
we hereafter refer to air, the same also applies to any<br>
other gas than air.<br>
A method for cool drying is already known, whereby on<br>
the basis of measurements of the vaporizer pressure or the<br>
vaporizer temperature, the cooling circuit is switched on<br>
or off.<br>
If a take-off of compressed air is recorded, the cooling<br>
circuit is started and as soon as the take-off of<br>
compressed air stops again, the cooling circuit is stopped<br>
again as well.<br>
A disadvantage of such a known method is that the<br>
heat exchanger, after the cooling circuit has been switched<br>
off, will heat up as there is no cooling any more.<br>
When, subsequently, compressed air is taken off again<br>
while the heat exchanger is still relatively warm,<br><br>
WO 2006/133522	PCT/BE2006/000041<br>
3<br>
temperature and dew point peaks may instantly occur in<br>
the supplied compressed air, since the gas to be dried in<br>
the heat exchanger is not sufficiently cooled then to<br>
make the water in said gas to be dried condense at<br>
maximum capacity.<br>
A method for cool drying is known as well, whereby the<br>
cooling circuit stays operational at all times, also when<br>
there is no take-off of compressed air.<br>
A major disadvantage of such a method is that it requires a<br>
considerable amount of energy, as the cooling circuit stays<br>
continuously operational, also in case of idle running.<br>
A method for cool drying is also known whereby use is<br>
made of a thermal mass. With such a known method, use is<br>
made of an intermediary thermal mass, for example in the<br>
form of a mixture of water and propylene glycol, for<br>
cooling the compressed air.<br>
Since the cooling circuit is only used for cooling the<br>
above-mentioned thermal mass, the compressor in this<br>
cooling circuit can be switched off as soon as the<br>
thermal mass has reached a certain temperature, such that<br>
energy can be saved.<br>
A disadvantage of such a known method is that the cooling<br>
circuit, due to the presence of the above-mentioned<br>
thermal mass, must be made very heavy and sizeable.<br>
Another disadvantage of such a known method is that, due<br><br>
WO 2006/133522	PCT/BE2006/000041<br>
4<br>
to additional parts such as a reservoir and/or an<br>
additional heat exchanger, the construction of the<br>
cooling circuit is relatively expensive and complicated<br>
and its assembly is very time-cqnsuming.<br>
The present invention aims to remedy one or several of<br>
the above-mentioned and other disadvantages.<br>
To this end, the present invention concerns a method as<br>
described above, which consists, at least when no gas to be<br>
dried is supplied, in measuring the ambient temperature as<br>
well as the temperature or the dew point in the vicinity<br>
of the place where the temperature of the gas to be<br>
dried is the lowest when cool drying, and to switch<br>
the cooling circuit on and off on the basis of these<br>
measurements so as to always maintain the lowest gas<br>
temperature or the dew point between a pre-determined<br>
certain minimum and maximum threshold value, whereby<br>
one or both of the above-mentioned pre-determined<br>
threshold values are calculated on the basis of an<br>
algorithm which is a function of the measured ambient<br>
temperature (Tamb).<br>
By the lowest air temperature or LAT is meant here the<br>
lowest temperature of the air to be dried which occurs<br>
during cool drying and which is in principle reached at<br>
the outlet for the gas to be dried of the secondary part<br>
of the heat exchanger. The LAT always gives a good<br>
indication of the dew point of the air, since there is a<br>
connection between both.<br><br>
WO 2006/133522	PCT/BE2006/000041<br>
5<br>
An advantage of such a method according to the invention<br>
is that no extra thermal mass is required and that energy-<br>
can be saved in a very simple manner, since the cooling<br>
circuit is switched off in due time, for example<br>
when no compressed air needs to be dried since there is<br>
no consumption of compressed air.<br>
Another advantage of such a method is that the<br>
temperature of the heat exchanger is always restricted,<br>
since the cooling circuit is started again when the<br>
measured LAT or the dew point becomes too high, and thus<br>
peaks are avoided.<br>
Since the pre-determined threshold values are<br>
calculated on the basis of an algorithm which is a<br>
function of the measured ambient temperature, a dew point<br>
is guaranteed at any ambient temperature which is<br>
sufficiently low to avoid corrosion or condensate in the<br>
compressed air network following the device for cool<br>
drying.<br>
In order to better explain the characteristics of the<br>
present invention, the following preferred method<br>
according to the invention is given as an example only,<br>
with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:<br>
figure 1 represents a device for applying a method<br>
according to the invention for cool drying;<br>
figure 2 schematically represents the course of the<br>
threshold values as a function of the ambient<br>
temperature.<br><br>
WO 2006/133522	PCT/BE2006/000041<br>
6<br>
Figure 1 represents a device 1 for cool drying which mainly<br>
consists of a heat exchanger 2 whose primary part forms<br>
the vaporizer 3 of a cooling circuit 4 in which<br>
are successively also erected a compressor 6, a<br>
condenser 7 and an expansion valve 8, driven by a motor 5.<br>
This cooling circuit is filled with cooling fluid, for<br>
example Freon R404a, whose stream direction is<br>
represented by arrow 9.<br>
The secondary part of the heat exchanger 2 is part of<br>
the pipe 10 for humid air to be dried whose stream<br>
direction is represented by arrow 11.<br>
After the heat exchanger 2, i.e. at its outlet, is erected<br>
a liquid separator 12 in the pipe 10.<br>
This pipe 10, before reaching the heat exchanger 2, may<br>
extend partly through a pre-cooler or a recuperation heat<br>
exchanger 13 and then, following the liquid separator 12,<br>
extend through the recuperation heat exchanger 13 again,<br>
in parallel flow or counter flow to the above-<br>
mentioned part.<br>
The outlet of the above-mentioned pipe 10 can for example<br>
be connected to a compressed air network which is<br>
not represented in the figures, to which<br>
consumers of compressed air are connected, for<br>
example tools that are driven by compressed air.<br><br>
WO 2006/133522	PCT/BE2006/000041<br>
7<br>
The heat exchanger 2 is a liquid/air heat exchanger and<br>
may be designed as forming a whole with the possible<br>
recuperation heat exchanger 13 which is an air/air heat<br>
exchanger.<br>
The expansion valve 8 is in this case made in the shape<br>
of a thermostatic valve whose thermostatic element is<br>
coupled in the known manner by means of a pipe 14 to a<br>
bulb 15 provided at the outlet of the vaporizer 3, in<br>
other words between the vaporizer 3 and the compressor<br>
6, on the cooling circuit 4 and filled with the same<br>
cooling medium.<br>
It is clear that the above-mentioned expansion valve 8<br>
can be realised in many different ways, such as for<br>
example in the form of an electronic valve which is coupled<br>
to a temperature gauge erected on the far end of the<br>
vaporizer 3 or following it.<br>
In some small cool dryers 1, the expansion valve 8 may be<br>
replaced by a capillary tube.<br>
The compressor 6 is for example a volumetric compressor<br>
which, at the same rotational speed, delivers practically<br>
the same volume flow, for example a spiral compressor,<br>
whereas the motor 5 is an electric motor in this<br>
case which is coupled to a control device 14.<br>
The above-mentioned control device 14, which may be<br>
realised for example in the form of a PLC, is also<br>
connected to measuring devices 16 for the LAT and to<br><br>
WO 2006/133522	PCT/BE2006/000041<br>
8<br>
measuring devices 17 for the ambient temperature.<br>
The above-mentioned measuring devices 16 for the LAT are<br>
preferably provided on the spot where the lowest air<br>
temperature can be actually expected, which is in this<br>
case right after the secondary part of the heat<br>
exchanger 2 and preferably before the liquid<br>
separator 12.<br>
According to the invention, it is not excluded that<br>
the measuring devices 16 for measuring the LAT are<br>
replaced by measuring devices for measuring the dew<br>
point, which are preferably provided near the outlet of<br>
the secondary part of the above-mentioned heat exchanger<br>
2. Each time measuring devices 16 for measuring the LAT<br>
are mentioned hereafter, also measuring devices for<br>
measuring the dew point can be applied according to the<br>
invention.<br>
The above-mentioned measuring devices 17 for measuring<br>
the ambient temperature are preferably placed at the<br>
compressed air network which makes use of the air dried by<br>
the device 1, in particular at the height of the end<br>
consumers of this compressed air, for example near the<br>
tools which are driven by this dried compressed air.<br>
Alternatively, the measuring devices 17 can also be<br>
provided in other places. In case the compressed air to be<br>
dried comes for example from a compressor, it turns out<br>
that a good positioning for the above-mentioned<br>
measuring devices 17 for the ambient temperature is at the<br><br>
WO 2006/133522	PCT/BE2006/000041<br>
9<br>
inlet of such a compressor.<br>
The improved method according to the invention is very-<br>
simple and as follows.<br>
The air to be dried is guided through the pipe 10 and<br>
thus through the heat exchanger 2, for example counter<br>
flow to the cooling fluid in the vaporizer 3 of the<br>
cooling circuit 4.<br>
In this heat exchanger 2, the damp air is cooled, as a<br>
result of which condensate is formed which is separated<br>
in the liquid separator 12.<br>
The cold air, which contains less moisture in absolute<br>
terms after said liquid separator 12, but still has a<br>
relative humidity of 100%, is heated in the recuperation<br>
heat exchanger 13, as a result of which the relative<br>
humidity decreases to preferably less than 50%, whereas<br>
the fresh air to be dried is already partly cooled in<br>
the recuperation heat exchanger 13 before being supplied<br>
to the heat exchanger 2.<br>
Thus, the air at the outlet of the recuperation heat<br>
exchanger 13 is drier than at the inlet of the heat<br>
exchanger 2.<br>
The LAT is preferably maintained within certain<br>
limits, so as to prevent freezing of the vaporizer 3<br>
due to a too low LAT on the one hand, and to make sure<br>
that the air is still sufficiently cooled so as to<br><br>
WO 2006/133522	PCT/BE2006/000041<br>
10<br>
allow for condensation on the other hand.<br>
To this end, the cooling circuit 4 according to the<br>
invention can be switched on and off on the basis of<br>
measurements of the LAT and the ambient temperature, for<br>
example by switching on and off the driving motor 5 of<br>
the compressor 6 of this cooling circuit 4.<br>
In this manner, one can make sure that the LAT or the<br>
dew point is always situated between a pre-determined<br>
minimum threshold value A and a maximum threshold value<br>
B.<br>
This regulation is not only applied according to the<br>
invention while drying the air, but also during the periods<br>
in which no air to be dried is being supplied and the<br>
cooling circuit 4 could be switched off in theory, as is<br>
the case with the known cool dryers.<br>
In particular, the method according to the invention is<br>
at least applied when no gas to be dried is being<br>
supplied and if need be also when gas to be dried is<br>
being supplied.<br>
To this end, the temperature or the dew point is measured<br>
in the vicinity of the place where the temperature of the<br>
gas to be dried is the lowest when cool drying, and<br>
preferably immediately after the secondary part of the<br>
heat exchanger 2.<br>
Preferably, one or both of the above-mentioned<br><br>
WO 2006/133522	PCT/BE2006/000041<br>
11<br>
threshold values A and/or B are calculated on the<br>
basis of an algorithm which is a function of the<br>
measured ambient temperature Tamb.<br>
Figure 2 schematically represents a possible connection<br>
between the ambient temperature Tamb and the above-<br>
mentioned minimum and maximum threshold values A, B<br>
respectively.<br>
As is represented, the algorithm of the minimum<br>
threshold value A is preferably formed by a step<br>
function which, when the ambient temperature is smaller<br>
than a first set value Ta, is constant, and in this case<br>
amounts to practically 4°C, so as to prevent freezing of<br>
the vaporizer 3.<br>
When the ambient temperature Tamb is higher than a<br>
second set value Tb, which is higher than the above-<br>
mentioned first set value Ta, the above-mentioned step<br>
function will be constant as well in this case.<br>
Between the above-mentioned set values Ta and Tb, the<br>
above-mentioned step function of the algorithm of the<br>
minimum threshold value A has an ascending course which<br>
in this case, but not necessarily, is linear and which<br>
is also preferably such that the difference between<br>
the ambient temperature and said calculated minimum<br>
threshold value A is constant and preferably amounts to at<br>
least 10° Celsius.<br>
In this case, the algorithm of the maximum threshold<br><br>
WO 2006/133522	PCT/BE2006/000041<br>
12<br>
value B is also formed by a step function which has a<br>
greater value than the step function of the above-mentioned<br>
minimum threshold value A at any value of the ambient<br>
temperature Tamb and which, when the ambient temperature<br>
Tamb is smaller than a first set value Tc, is constant.<br>
The first set value Tc of the step function of the maximum<br>
threshold value B in this case coincides with the above -<br>
mentioned first set value Ta of the step function of<br>
the minimum threshold value A, but this is not required<br>
according to the invention.<br>
As soon as an ambient temperature Tamb is higher than<br>
a second set value Td, the above-mentioned step<br>
function of the maximum threshold value B will be<br>
constant as well in this case, but it may also have<br>
a different course according to the invention.<br>
Between the above-mentioned set values Tc and Td, the<br>
above-mentioned step function of the algorithm of the<br>
maximum threshold value B also has an ascending course<br>
which, in this case but not necessarily, is linear, and<br>
which is also preferably such that its course is steeper<br>
than the course of the above-mentioned ascending function<br>
of the minimum threshold value A.<br>
The aim of the above-mentioned maximum threshold value<br>
B consists in avoiding that the LAT gets too high, as a<br>
result of which the air would not be sufficiently cooled<br>
and as a result of which not enough moisture would condense<br>
so as to be able to dry the air.<br><br>
WO 2006/133522	PCT/BE2006/000041<br>
13<br>
Preferably, according to the invention, while the device 1<br>
for cool drying is operational, the measured value of<br>
the LAT is continuously compared by the above-<br>
mentioned control means 14 or compared at certain,<br>
either or not regular, intervals to the above-mentioned<br>
minimum threshold value A and the maximum threshold value<br>
B.<br>
When the LAT temporarily drops under the minimum<br>
threshold value A, the above-mentioned control device 14<br>
will switch off the cooling circuit 4, by switching off<br>
the motor 5 which drives the compressor 6 of this cooling<br>
circuit 4, such that the temperature in the above-<br>
mentioned heat exchanger 7 rises and also the LAT will<br>
increase again.<br>
When the measured LAT rises above the maximum threshold<br>
value B, the cooling circuit 4 is switched on again, as<br>
the motor 5 which drives the compressor 6 of this<br>
cooling circuit 4 is switched on again, as a result of<br>
which the temperature in the vaporizer 3 decreases and<br>
also the LAT drops again.<br>
Since the cooling circuit 4 is only switched on when<br>
this is required, a method for cool drying according to<br>
the invention will help to save energy.<br>
By switching on the cooling circuit 4 again in due time,<br>
one also makes sure that the heat exchanger 2 does not<br>
heat up, such that when the compressed air supply is<br><br>
WO 2006/133522	PCT/BE2006/000041<br>
14<br>
loaded again, for example after a standstill, there can be<br>
no temperature and dew point peaks in the compressed air<br>
being taken off.<br>
The working of the cooling circuit 4 is already known as<br>
such and it is as follows.<br>
In the condenser 7, the gaseous cooling fluid which is<br>
heated by the compression in the compressor 6, is cooled<br>
until it becomes liquid. In order to discharge the heat<br>
to the environment, use can for example be made of a fan<br>
or a cooling medium which is not represented in the figure,<br>
such as for example water.<br>
Thanks to the expansion valve 8, the liquid cooling<br>
fluid expands to a constant vaporizer pressure, which of<br>
course implies a temperature drop.<br>
By applying a thermostatic expansion valve 8, there will<br>
always be overheating after the vaporizer 3, such that<br>
there is no danger of cooling fluid entering the<br>
compressor 6, and, as a consequence, there is no need for a<br>
liquid separator in the cooling circuit 4.<br>
Said overheating is measured in the known manner by<br>
distracting the temperature measured by the bulb 14 from<br>
the vaporizer temperature, in this case measured after<br>
the vaporizer 3. This difference is compared to a set<br>
value by the expansion valve 8, and in case of a<br>
difference, the expansion valve 8 will adjust it by .<br>
opening or by closing.<br><br>
WO 2006/133522	PCT/BE2006/000041<br>
15<br>
According to the invention, it is not excluded for a fan<br>
taking care of the heat dissipation from the condenser 7,<br>
to be started and stopped as well by the above-mentioned<br>
control means 14, as a function of the measurements of<br>
the ambient temperature Tamb and the LAT or the dew<br>
point, such that energy can be saved here as well.<br>
Preferably, after the above-mentioned cooling circuit 4<br>
has been switched off, a certain minimum time interval<br>
is taken into account before the cooling circuit 4 can be<br>
started again.<br>
Thus is avoided that the above-mentioned motor 5, which<br>
can be realised for example as an electric motor, would<br>
become overloaded due to heat accumulation in the windings.<br>
Instead of damp air, other gas than air containing water<br>
vapour can be dried in the same manner and with the same<br>
device. The LAT is the lowest gas temperature then.<br>
The present invention is by no means limited to the method<br>
described as an example; on the contrary, such an improved<br>
method according to the invention for cool drying can be<br>
realised in many different ways while still remaining<br>
within the scope of the invention.<br><br>

which also comprises a compressor (6) which is driven by a<br>
motor (5) ; a condenser (7) / an expansion means {8)<br>
between the outlet of the condenser (7) and the inlet of<br>
the above-mentioned vaporizer (3) , characterised in that it<br>
consists in measuring the ambient temperature (Tamb), at<br>
least when no gas to be dried is being supplied, as well<br>
as the temperature or the dew point in the vicinity of<br>
the place where the temperature of the gas to be dried is<br>
the lowest when cool drying, and in switching the cooling<br>
circuit (4) on and off on the basis of these measurements<br>
in order to always maintain the lowest gas temperature<br>
(LAT) or the dew point between a pre-determined minimum<br>
and maximum threshold value (A, B respectively), and<br>
whereby one or both of the above-mentioned pre-determined<br>
threshold values (A and B) are calculated on the basis<br>
of an algorithm which is a function of the measured<br>
ambient temperature (Tamb).<br>
2.- Method according to claim 1, characterised in that<br>
the gas to be dried originates from a compressor and in<br>
that the ambient temperature (Tamb) is measured near the<br>
inlet of this compressor.<br><br>

3.- Method according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in<br>
that the lowest gas temperature (LAT) or the dew point of<br>
the gas to be dried is measured near the outlet of the<br>
secondary part of the above-mentioned heat exchanger (2) .<br>
4.- Method according to any of the preceding claims,<br>
characterised in that the algorithm of the minimum<br>
threshold value (A) as a function of the ambient<br>
temperature is formed by a step function with a constant<br>
value when the measured ambient temperature (Tamb) is<br>
smaller than a first set value (Ta) ; a higher constant<br>
value for an ambient temperature (Tamb) larger than a<br>
second set value (Tb) which is larger than the above-<br>
mentioned first set value (Ta) ; and a rising function<br>
between these set values (Ta and Tb) .<br>
5.- Method according to claim 4, characterised in that<br>
the above-mentioned rising function of the minimum<br>
threshold value (A) is linear.<br>
6.- Method according to claim 5, characterised in that<br>
the above-mentioned linear rising function of the<br>
minimum threshold value (A) is such that the difference<br>
between the measured ambient temperature (Tamb) and this<br>
calculated minimum threshold value (A) is constant.<br>

characterised in that the algorithm of the maximum<br>
threshold value (B) as a function of the<br>
ambient temperature (Tamb) is formed by a step function<br>
with a constant value when the measured ambient<br>
temperature (Tamb) is smaller than a first set value<br>
(Tc); a higher constant value for an ambient temperature<br>
(Tamb) is larger than a second set value (Td) which is<br>
larger than the first set value (Tc) ; and a rising<br>
function between these set values (Tc and Td) .<br>
9.- Method according to claim 8, characterised in that<br>
the above-mentioned rising function of the maximum<br>
threshold value (B) is linear.<br>
10.- Method according to claims 4 and 8, characterised<br>
in that the course of the above-mentioned rising function<br>
of the maximum threshold value (B) is steeper than the<br>
course of the above-mentioned rising function of the<br>
minimum threshold value (A).<br>
11.- Method according to any of the preceding claims,<br>
characterised in that, preferably after the above-mentioned<br>
cooling circuit (4) has been switched off, a certain<br>
minimum time interval is taken into account before it<br>
can be started again.<br><br><br><br>
Method for cool drying gas, in particular air, whereby this gas is guided through the<br>
secondary part of a heat exchanger (2) whose primary part is the vaporizer (3) of a<br>
cooling circuit (4), which consists in measuring the ambient temperature (Tamb), as<br>
well as the lowest gas temperature (LAT) or the dew point, and to switch the cooling<br>
circuit (4) on and off on the basis of these measurements in order to always maintain<br>
the lowest gas temperature (LAT) or the dew point between a pre-determined minimum<br>
and maximum threshold value, and whereby pre-determined threshold values are<br>
calculated on the basis of an algorithm which is a function of the measured ambient<br>
temperature (Tamb).<br></td>
