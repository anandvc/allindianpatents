SYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR OPERATING Z-SOURCE INVERTER<br>
INDUCTORS IN A CONTINUOUS CURRENT MODE<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001] The present invention generally relates to inverters, and more<br>
particularly relates to systems and methods for operating inductors in a Z-<br>
source inverter in a continuous current mode.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002] FIG. 1 is a schematic diagram of a conventional Z-source inverter<br>
100 including a Z-impedance portion 110 and a three-phase inverter portion<br>
120 coupled to an alternating current (AC) motor 150. Z-impedance portion<br>
110 comprises an inductor 1110 having an output coupled to the negative<br>
terminal of a voltage source (VDC) and a negative terminal of a capacitor 1120<br>
via a node 1115. The input of inductor 1110 is coupled to a negative terminal<br>
of a capacitor 1130 and inverter portion 120 via a node 1125 known as a<br>
negative DC-link.<br>
[0003] Z-impedance portion 110 also includes a power switch 1140<br>
coupled to the positive terminal of VDC and coupled to the input of an inductor<br>
1150 and a positive terminal of capacitor 1130 via a node 1135. The output of<br>
inverter 1150 is coupled to the positive terminal of capacitor 1120 and inverter<br>
portion 120 via a node 1145 known as a positive DC-link.<br>
[0004] Inverter portion 120 includes three branches 1210, 1220, and 1230<br>
coupled to AC motor 150 via nodes 1215, 1225, and 1235, respectively. Each<br>
of branches 1210, 1220, and 1230 comprise an upper power switch 1250<br>
coupled in series to a lower power switch 1260 via a respective one of nodes<br>
1215, 1225, and 1235. Each power switch 1250, 1260 includes a diode<br>
coupled in parallel with a switch and is capable of conducting current in two<br>
directions, and is also capable of stopping voltage in one direction.<br><br>
[0005] Power switches 1250, 1260 control the flow of current within a<br>
portion of each respective branch of branches 1210, 1220, and 1230. Power<br>
switches 1250, 1260 are typically software controlled switches utilizing high<br>
frequency pulse width modulation (PWM) techniques.<br>
[0006] During operation, one power switch 1250, 1260 in each of<br>
branches 1210, 1220, and 1230 is open and the other power switch 1250, 1260<br>
is closed. In this configuration, closing a power switch 1250, 1260 allows<br>
current to flow within a portion of the branch, whereas opening the power<br>
switch 1250, 1260 prevents current from flowing within that portion. For<br>
example, closing the upper power switch 1250 (and opening lower power<br>
switch 1260) of branch 1210 allows current to flow from VDC to terminal I1<br>
via the positive DC-link (i.e., node 1145).<br>
[0007] A high frequency PWM technique is typically utilized to control<br>
the magnitude, phase angle, and the frequency of power output to AC motor<br>
150. That is, while power switches 1250, 1260 are controlled to operate at a<br>
substantially constant switching frequency, the switch duty cycles are<br>
modulated to produce three-phase voltages of desired magnitude, phase, and<br>
frequency.<br>
[0008] AC motor 150 includes three terminals (e.g., terminals I1 - I3)<br>
coupled to inverter portion 120. Terminal I1 is coupled to node 1215, terminal<br>
I2 is coupled to node 1225, and terminal I3 is coupled to node 1235. AC motor<br>
150 is energized with power supplied from inverter 100 and produces a<br>
mechanical output based on the supplied power.<br>
[0009] When high amounts of power (e.g., current greater than the critical<br>
current of inductors 1110 and 1150) are supplied to AC motor 150, Z-source<br>
inverter 100 functions in a continuous mode. However, when Z-source<br>
inverter 100 is supplying low amounts of power or zero power (e.g., current<br>
less than the critical current of inductors 1110 and 1150) to AC motor 150, the<br>
voltage stored in capacitors 1120 and 1130 gradually increases because the<br>
DC-link current is less than the critical current of inductors 1110, 1150, which<br>
results in Z-source inverter 100 operating in a discontinuous mode. Should<br><br>
the voltage stored in capacitors 1120 and 1130 exceed the DC-link voltage<br>
rating of Z-source inverter 100, Z-source inverter 100 may become damaged.<br>
[0010] One method to prevent capacitors 1120 and 1130 from exceeding<br>
the DC-link voltage rating of Z-source inverter 100 is to design Z-source<br>
inverter 100 to operate in a continuous mode from minimum to maximum<br>
loads by increasing the size of inductors 1110 and 1150. Although this<br>
effectively prevents capacitors 1120 and 1130 from exceeding the DC-link<br>
voltage rating of Z-source inverter 100, larger inductors increase the size and<br>
the cost associated with manufacturing Z-source inverter 100.<br>
[0011] Accordingly, it is desirable to provide systems and methods for<br>
operating inductors in a Z-source inverter in a continuous current mode to<br>
control the voltage at the positive DC-link so that the capacitors do not store<br>
excessive amounts of voltage. It is also desirable to provide systems and<br>
methods for preventing capacitors in a Z-source inverter from storing<br>
excessive amounts of voltage without increasing the size and/or cost of<br>
manufacturing the Z-source inverter. Furthermore, other desirable features<br>
and characteristics of the present invention will become apparent from the<br>
subsequent detailed description and the appended claims, taken in conjunction<br>
with the accompanying drawings and the foregoing technical field and<br>
background.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0012] Various embodiments of the invention provide systems, methods,<br>
and apparatus for operating inductors in a Z-source inverter in a continuous<br>
current mode. One system comprises an alternating current (AC) motor and<br>
an inverter coupled to the AC motor. The inverter is configured to provide<br>
current and a first amount of reactive power to the AC motor.<br>
[0013] The system also comprises a processor coupled to the AC motor<br>
and the inverter. The processor is configured to monitor the current and<br>
instruct the inverter to provide a second amount of reactive power greater than<br><br>
the first amount to the AC motor if the current is below a threshold current<br>
amount.<br>
[0014] A method comprises the step of determining if a plurality of<br>
inductors are providing current to an inverter at or below a threshold current<br>
amount. Furthermore, the method comprises the step of inducing an AC<br>
motor to draw more reactive power if the plurality of inductors are providing<br>
current at or below the threshold current amount.<br>
[0015] One apparatus comprises means for determining if a current<br>
produced by a plurality of inverter inductors is at or below a threshold current<br>
amount. The apparatus also comprises means for altering a first current<br>
component in the d-axis (Id) and a first current component in the q-axis (Iq) of<br>
synchronous currents to form altered synchronous currents provided to the<br>
inverter to cause the inverter to provide more reactive power to an AC motor.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF AN EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENT<br>
[0024] The following detailed description is merely exemplary in nature<br>
and is not intended to limit the invention or the application and uses of the<br>
invention. Furthermore, there is no intention to be bound by any expressed or<br>
implied theory presented in the preceding technical field, background, brief<br>
summary or the following detailed description.<br>
[0025] FIG. 2 is a diagram of a control system 200 of Z-source inverter<br>
100 and AC motor 150. Inverter portion 120 is supplied current from Z-<br>
impedance portion 110 and three voltage controls Va*, Vb*, and Vc* for<br>
branches 1210, 1220, and 1230, respectively. Upon receipt of voltage controls<br>
Va, Vb, and Vc, inverter portion 120 supplies power Pa, Pb, and Pc to AC motor<br>
150 for operation, and draws the current from Z-impedance portion 110.<br>
[0026] To determine voltage controls Va*, Vb*, and Vc*, a torque<br>
command (T*) from an external processor (not shown), the motor speed (ωr)<br>
of AC motor 150, and the voltage (VDClink) at the positive DC-link (i.e., node<br>
1145) are fed to a current command look-up table 210, and the phase angle (θr)<br>
of AC motor 150 is supplied to a 3-phase stationary frame-to-D-Q<br>
synchronous frame (3-to-DQ) converter 230 and a D-Q synchronous frame-to-<br>
3-phase stationary frame (DQ-to-3) converter 240. Current command look-up<br>
table 210 converts torque command T* into a q-axis current command (Iq*)<br>
and a d-axis current command (Id*), which are then supplied to a synchronous<br>
current regulator 220.<br>
[0027] Synchronous current regulator 220 also receives feedback currents<br>
Iq and Id in addition to synchronous current commands having q-axis current<br>
component (Iq*) and d-axis current component (Id*) from 3-to-DQ converter<br>
230. Current regulator 220 provides the voltage command in the d-axis (Vd*),<br>
and the voltage command in the q-axis (Vq*), which are then supplied to DQ-<br>
to-3 converter 240.<br><br>
[0028] DQ-to-3 converter 240 also receives a phase angle (θr) of AC<br>
motor 150 and converts the two phase voltage command Vq* and voltage<br>
command Vd* in the synchronous frame into three phase voltage commands<br>
(Va*, Vb*, and Vc*) in the stationary frame. Voltage commands Va*, Vb*, and<br>
Vc* are then supplied to branches 1210, 1220, and 1230, respectively.<br>
[0029] FIG. 3 is a block diagram of one exemplary embodiment of a<br>
system 300 for operating inductors 1110 and 1150 of Z-source inverter 100<br>
(see FIG. 1) in a continuous current mode. As illustrated in FIG. 3, system<br>
300 comprises Z-source inverter 100 coupled to AC motor 150 similar to the<br>
discussion above with reference to FIG. 1. Furthermore, system 300<br>
comprises a processor 310 coupled to Z-source inverter 100 and AC motor<br>
150. Specifically, processor 310 is coupled to Z-source inverter 100 such that<br>
processor 310 is capable of receiving the current (Iinv) at the positive DC-link<br>
(e.g., node 1145) of Z-source inverter 100 and coupled to AC motor 150 such<br>
that processor 310 receives the motor speed (cor) of AC motor 150.<br>
[0030] Processor 310 may be any hardware, software, and/or device<br>
capable of controlling and/or altering the voltage commands provided to Z-<br>
source inverter 100, which in turn affects power Pa, Pb, and Pc supplied to AC<br>
motor 150. In accordance with one exemplary embodiment of the invention,<br>
processor 310 comprises a reactive power module 3110 configured to alter the<br>
voltage commands Va*, Vb*, and Vc* supplied to Z-source inverter 100 so that<br>
Z-source inverter 100 can induce AC motor 150 to draw additional reactive<br>
power from Z-source inverter 100 and/or increase the amount of reactive<br>
power supplied to AC motor 150.<br>
[0031] Reactive power module 3110 is configured to compare the amount<br>
of current (Iinv) at the positive DC-link with a threshold current (Imin) amount<br>
to determine if Z-source inverter 100 is providing low power or zero power to<br>
AC motor 150. In accordance with one exemplary embodiment of the<br>
invention, the threshold current Imin is the critical current for inductors 1110<br>
and/or 1150, which depends on the size of inductor 1110 and/or 1150.<br><br>
[0032] If current Iinv is at or below the threshold current Imin, reactive<br>
power module 3110 is configured to alter the q-axis current command Iq* and<br>
the d-axis current command Id* supplied to synchronous current regulator 220,<br>
which in turn alters the voltage command Vd* and voltage command Vq*<br>
supplied to DQ-to-3 converter 240. The altered voltage command Vd* and<br>
voltage command Vq* results in altered voltage commands Va*, Vt,*, and Vc*<br>
being supplied to inverter 100. The altered voltage commands Va Va*, Vb*,<br>
and Vc* supplied to inverter 100 cause inverter 100 to induce AC motor 150 to<br>
draw more reactive power from inverter 100 and/or add reactive power to AC<br>
motor 150.<br>
[0033] When reactive power is added to AC motor 150, the current Iinv in<br>
the DC-link increases and is kept above current Imin. By controlling the<br>
reactive power flowing to AC motor 150, Z-source inverter 100 operates in a<br>
continuous current mode at light loads, and the voltage at the positive DC-link<br>
can be regulated.<br>
[0034] If current Iinv is above current Imin, reactive power module does not<br>
alter the q-axis current command Iq* and the d-axis current command Id*<br>
supplied to inverter 100. That is, system 300 operates in a similar manner to<br>
inverter 100 discussed above with reference to FIGS. 1 and 2.<br>
[0035] FIG. 4 is diagram of an exemplary embodiment of a control system<br>
400 for system 300. Control system 400 comprises Z-impedance 110, inverter<br>
120 (which form Z-source inverter 100), AC motor 150, current command<br>
look-up table 210, synchronous current regulator 220, 3-to-DQ converter 230,<br>
DQ-to-3 converter 240 similar to control system 200 discussed above with<br>
reference to FIG. 2. Control system 400 also comprises reactive power<br>
module 3110 (see FIG. 3) coupled to the output of current command look-up<br>
table 210 and the input of synchronous current regulator 220.<br>
[0036] Reactive power module 3110 comprises a subtractor 3112 coupled<br>
to the positive DC-link of inverter 100 and is configured to subtract current Iinv<br>
from current Imin to create a difference current (Ie), which may represented by<br>
the equation (Iinv-Imin). As discussed above, current Imin may be the critical<br><br>
current of inductor 1110 and/or 1150, or another pre-determined current<br>
amount.<br>
[0037] Difference current Ie is supplied to a proportion-integral (PI)<br>
controller 3114, and PI controller 3114 is configured to adjust difference<br>
current Ie to form an adjusting current (Iadj1). Adjusting current Iadj1 is supplied<br>
to a limiter 3116, and limiter 3116 is configured to limit adjusting current Iadj1<br>
within a pre-determined limit to generate a delta adjusting current in the d-axis<br>
(Δla). In accordance with one exemplary embodiment, delta adjusting d-axis<br>
current Δld has a maximum value 0. That is, delta adjusting d-axis current Δld <br>
is allowed to be between a negative value and zero.<br>
[0038] Delta adjusting d-axis current Δld is supplied back to PI controller<br>
3114 via a feedback loop 3115 and supplied to an adder 3120. Adder 3120 is<br>
configured to add delta adjusting d-axis current Δld to the d-axis current<br>
command Id* to generate an altered current command (Id**)- When delta<br>
adjusting d-axis current Δld is zero (i.e., Iinv &gt; Imin), the operation of inverter<br>
100 is similar to the discussion above with respect to control system 200 of<br>
FIG. 2 because altered current command Id** is equal to current command Id*<br>
(i.e., Id* + 0 = Id* -&gt; Id** = Id*). When delta adjusting d-axis current Δld is<br>
negative (i.e., Imin &gt; Iinv), altered current command Id** will be less than<br>
current command Id* (i.e., Id** 
supplied to synchronous current regulator 220.<br>
[0039] Delta adjusting d-axis current Δld is also supplied to a K multiplier<br>
3122, and K multiplier 3122 also receives torque command T* and motor<br>
speed ωr inputs from AC motor 150. K multiplier 3122 multiplies delta<br>
adjusting d-axis current Δld by a K-factor to generate a second adjusting<br>
current (Iadj2). Adjusting current Iadj2 is supplied to a limiter 3125 to limit<br>
adjusting current Iadj2, which generates a delta adjusting d-axis current AIq.<br>
The limiter is used to make sure that delta adjusting d-axis current ΔIq is<br>
within the operating range of inverter 100, which operating range depends on<br>
the size of the various components (e.g., inductors 1110, 1150 and capacitors<br>
1120, 1130) used in system 300.<br><br>
[0040] Delta adjusting q-axis current ΔIq is supplied to an adder 3130, and<br>
adder 3130 is configured to add ΔIq to current command Iq* to generate an<br>
altered current command (Iq**). Similar to altered current command la**,<br>
altered current command Iq** is supplied to synchronous current regulator<br>
220. The change in both altered current commands Id** and Iq** results in<br>
altered voltage commands Va*, Vt,*, and Vc* being supplied to Z-source<br>
inverter 100. The altered voltage commands Va*, Vb*, and Vc* cause Z-<br>
source inverter 100 to induce AC motor 150 to draw a greater amount of<br>
reactive power from inverter 100 and/or to supply a greater amount of reactive<br>
power to AC motor 150. As discussed above, additional reactive power<br>
supplied and/or added to AC motor 150 induces AC motor 150 to regulate the<br>
voltage at the positive DC-link.<br>
[0041] FIG. 5 is a graph 500 illustrating at least one of the benefits of the<br>
present invention. Graph 500 includes a commanded torque line (T) and<br>
vectors 510, 520, and 530 shown with respect to current on the q-axis (Iq) and<br>
current on the d-axis (-Id). Commanded torque line T represents the amount of<br>
torque AC motor 150 should be producing or the desired torque, which torque<br>
is controlled by the amount of power supplied to AC motor 150 by Z-source<br>
inverter 100.<br>
[0042] Vector 510 points to a location on commanded torque line T<br>
representing the intersection of current commands Id* and Iq*. This location<br>
on commanded torque line T represents the operation of AC motor 150<br>
without additional reactive power, or under the operating conditions discussed<br>
above with respect to FIGS. 1 and 2.<br>
[0043] Vector 520 points to a location on commanded torque line T<br>
representing the intersection of current commands Id** and Iq**. This location<br>
on commanded torque line T represents the operation of AC motor 150 with<br>
additional reactive power as discussed above with reference to FIG. 4. AC<br>
motor 150 is induced to draw the additional reactive power because current<br>
commands Id** and Iq** are smaller values than current commands Id* and<br>
Iq*. That is, current command Id** is more negative than current command<br><br>
Id*, and current command Iq** is less positive than current command Iq*. This<br>
decrease in current at the positive DC-link reduces the ability of capacitors<br>
1120 and 1130 to store voltage, and represents inductors 1110 and 1150<br>
operating in continuous mode.<br>
[0044] Vector 530 represents the situation where current command Iq** is<br>
equal to zero and Id** is less than zero (which may be any negative value).<br>
Vector 530 points to a location on the -Iq axis and represents AC motor 150 at<br>
rest or zero torque output. Producing zero Iq** when AC motor 150 is at rest<br>
also reduces the amount of current at the positive DC-link, which likewise,<br>
reduces the ability of capacitors 1120 and 1130 to store voltage, and also<br>
represents inductors 1110 and 1150 operating in continuous current mode.<br>
[0045] FIG. 6 is a flow diagram of a method 600 for operating inductors<br>
(e.g., inductors 1110 and 1150) in a Z-source inverter (e.g., Z-source inverter<br>
100) in a continuous current mode. Method 600 begins by monitoring the<br>
current (e.g., Iinv) at the DC-link (e.g., node 1145) (step 610) to determine if<br>
current Iinv is at or below a threshold current Imjn (step 620). In one<br>
embodiment, step 620 comprises the step of determining if the plurality of<br>
inductors are providing the same amount or less current to the inverter than a<br>
critical current of the plurality of inductors<br>
[0046] If current Iinv is at or below the threshold current, an AC motor<br>
(e.g., AC motor 150) coupled to Z-source inverter 100 is induced to draw<br>
more reactive power (step 630). In one exemplary embodiment, AC motor<br>
150 is induced to draw more reactive power by changing the d-axis and q-axis<br>
current commands (i.e., changing Id* and Iq* to Id** and Iq**, respectively).<br>
In another embodiment, inducing AC motor 150 to draw more reactive power<br>
comprises controlling the current provided to AC motor 150 so that reactive<br>
power is added to AC motor 150 by Z-source inverter 100.<br>
[0047] Inducing AC motor 150 to draw more reactive power, in another<br>
embodiment, includes altering a synchronous current provided to a current<br>
regulator (e.g., synchronous current regulator 220) providing voltage to the<br>
inverter (via, for example, DQ-to-3 converter 240). In accordance with one<br><br>
embodiment where the synchronous current includes a d-axis current<br>
command (Id*) and a q-axis current command (Iq*), the altering step<br>
comprises adding a delta adjusting d-axis current (ΔId) to the d-axis current<br>
command Id* to form an altered d-axis current command (Id**), and adding a<br>
delta adjusting q-axis current (ΔIq) to the q-axis current command (Iq*) to<br>
form an altered q-axis current command (Iq**).<br>
[0048] If the DC-link current is above the threshold current, additional<br>
reactive power is not added to AC motor 150 and/or AC motor 150 is not<br>
induced to draw additional reactive power from Z-source inverter 100 (step<br>
640). That is, the operation of the Z-source inverter is not altered or operates<br>
similar to Z-source inverter 100 discussed above with reference to FIGS. 1 and<br>
2. Furthermore, after step 640 and/or step 630, current Iinv is continued to be<br>
monitored (step 650).<br>
[0049] FIG. 7 is a graph 700 illustrating at least one of the benefits of<br>
system 300. Graph 700 is divided in three sections (1,2, and 3) illustrating the<br>
characteristics of system 300 under various operating conditions.<br>
[0050] In section 1, AC motor 150 has zero speed (i.e., is at rest) as<br>
represented by line 710, and does not demand current from the positive DC-<br>
link (e.g., node 1145) as represented by line 720. As illustrated, the voltage,<br>
represented by line 730, of capacitors 1120 and 1130 increases indicating that<br>
inductors 1110 and 1150 are unstable (i.e., are operating in a discontinuous<br>
current mode), as represented by line 740.<br>
[0051] Section 2 illustrates the conditions when reactive power (i.e., Δld is<br>
negative and ΔIq is zero) is added to AC motor 150 (i.e., AC motor is induced<br>
to draw reactive power), as indicated by line 720, while AC motor 150<br>
remains at rest. The result of adding reactive power to AC motor 150 is that<br>
the voltage of capacitors 1120 and 1130 begins to decrease and inductors 1110<br>
and 1150 begin operating in a continuous current mode.<br>
[0052] In section 3, a large amount of torque is applied to AC motor 150,<br>
which applies active and reactive power to AC motor 150. The voltage of<br>
capacitors 1120 and 1130 continues to decrease, but is stable, indicating that<br><br>
inductors 1120 and 1130 are operating in continuous current mode.<br>
Furthermore, the motor speed increases and the phase current becomes<br>
sinusoidal. Moreover, the voltage of capacitors 1120 and 1130 can be<br>
maintained, increased, or decreased by controlling the amount of reactive<br>
power provided to AC motor 150.<br>
