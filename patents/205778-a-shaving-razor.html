COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See setion 10 &amp; Rule 13]	<br>
                 "A SHAVING RAZOR"<br><br>
ROLLING RAZOR LLC, a limited liability corporation of California, United States of America of 13802 NW Passage, Apt 219, Marina del Rey, California 90292, United States of America,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br><br>
J<br>
The present invention relates to a shaving razor.<br>
This present invention relates to a novel razor for shaving, and more particularly to a novel handle which provides for precise incremental rotational movement of the single or dual blades systems. This invention also provides a novel method of shaving resulting from the unique features of the roiling razor handle.<br>
Razors for shaving, both disposable razors and cartridge systems, are well known in the art. A commonality found in the prior art is the elongated handle, it may be wide, it may be narrow and it is often surfaced for better gripping, but the razor head, whether it be single, dual or blades is supported on an elongated substantially stick-like member such as those illustrated in U.S. Patents 4,026,016 issued to Nissen and 5,953,824 issued to Ferraro.<br>
Dual headed razors are found in the art U.S. Patent 4,989,328 issued to Sokoloff, teaches a full sized blade coupled with a reduced size trimming blade, mounted opposite each other for easy access. The Sokoloff razor is not a bi-directional device. A push-pull bi-directional razor for shaving is described in U.S. Patent 5,865,189 issued to which has a pair of mirror image blades affixed to a stick handle and describes a method of pushing and pulling the blades against ones skin by moving the handle in one direction and then another. Pushing a razor blade at the end of a stick handle up and against ones face allows for bi-directional use, but may not have the stability of the normal shaving direction.<br>
Both the Nissen and Ferraro patents illustrate pivoting and swiveling shaving heads affixed to a stick-like handle to overcome the restrictions and limitations of blade positioning and movement, which arise trying to accommodate the changing contours of the human face and the changing growth patterns of facial hair using a razor on a stick handle razor. Finger tin gripping of a stick handle may allow for greater maneuverability but the trade-off is to limit control. Summary of Invention The within invention provides a ring shaped rotatable handle supporting one or more sets of blades and a method of shaving using bi-directional movement by rolling the handle<br><br><br>
around the forefinger, and adjusting the pitch and position of the blades with the thumb and middle finger on opposites of the ring shaped handle allows for bi-directional shaving with a continuous pulling action.<br>
By eliminating the "stick"" handle and replacing it with the rolling ring handle the user becomes the pivot point and may control the system by using the sensitivity of their own fingers to adjust of the blades against the skin. This precise shaving system reduces cuts and nicks and enhances blade control. Additionally, the method yields precise pitch control, wherein the user may incrementally adjust the position of the blades, which makes facial, leg, underarm and whole head shaving simple and safe.<br>
The novel ring razor handle may be adapted to support a single set of blades for uni¬directional use, or a dual set of opposing blades for bi-directional use. The device may be disposable or provide for replaceable blades. The handle also provides a novel replaceable blade cartridge.<br>
The features of the invention believed to be novel are set forth with particularity in the appended claim. The invention itself, however, both as to configuration, and method of operation, and the advantages thereof, may be best understood by reference to the following descriptions taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.<br>

MODES FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
Referring now to the drawings, there is illustrated in FIG. 1A a perspective view of the rolling razor generally designated 10. This first embodiments a disposable razor for shaving. The non-replaceable shaving blades 11 are affixed to the front and back sides 12 &amp; 13 of the bi-directional shaving head 14 which is connected to the ring shaped handle 15 with a short planar member forming a neck 16. Referring now to Figures IB, 1C and ID there is illustrated two side views and one front view of the method of operation of the preferred embodiment 10. A user will hold the rolling razor 10 in his hand 400 by inserting his index finger 401 inside the ring shaped handle 15. The thumb 402 and middle finger 403 rest against opposite sides of the outer surface of the ring-shaped handle 15 and are used to incrementally control the rotation of the bi-directional shaving head 14 in relation to the index finger 401, by rolling the ring shaped handle 15 with the thumb 402 and middle finger 403.<br>
Figure IB illustrates a downward stroke from neck 301 to chin 302 along the line of arrow 200. The downward stroke is a pulling stroke with the bi-directional shaving head 14 following the hand 400 and the blades 11 attached to the front side 12 of the bi-directional shaving head 14 are drawn against the beard.<br>
Figure 1C illustrates the return stroke which may occur without lifting the bi¬directional shaving head 14 from the face 300. The return stroke along the line of arrow 201 is accomplished by completing the downward stroke and then incrementally rolling the bi-directional shaving head 14 around the index finger 401, (with the help of the thumb 402 and middle finger 403 illustrated in figure 1D), until the blades 11 affixed to the back side 13 are placed in contact with the face 300. The return stroke is shown from the chin 302 to neck 301 and is also a pulling stroke with the bi-directional shaving head 14 once again following the hand 400. It is envisioned that without departing from the intended scope of this invention, a plethora of blade and ring shaped handle configurations may be used as the support for a unidirectional or bi-directional shaving head and method. A critical feature of<br><br>
this invention is the incremental movement of the arched, or circular handle, with blades attached, around one or more fingers.<br>
Referring now to Figure 2, there is illustrated a cut-away side view of a first alternate embodiment of the rolling razor, generally designated 20. This embodiment shows a disposable razor for shaving. The non-replaceable shaving blades 11 are affixed to the front 21 of the unidirectional shaving head 22 which is connected to the ring shaped handle 15 via a short neck 16.<br>
Referring now to Figure 3 A, there is illustrated a cut-away side view of a second alternate embodiment of the rolling razor, generally designated 30. This embodiment shows a razor for shaving, which uses replaceable shaving blades. The shaving blades 31 are affixed to the front 32 and rear 33 of the replaceable bi-directional shaving head 34 which is connected to the ring shaped handle 15 via a latch and catch arrangement 35 &amp; 36 between the base of the replaceable bi-directional shaving head 34 and the top of the short neck 16.<br>

The latch 35 on the base of the replaceable bi¬directional shaving head 34 mates with the catch 36 on the top of the short neck 16, by sliding the replaceable bi-directional shaving head cartridge 34 along the line of arrow 202 a new cartridge may be added. A stopping catch (not shown) limits the insertion of the replaceable bi-directional shaving head cartridge 34 to a pre-selected distance on the short neck 16. Reversing the process allows the user to replace the replaceable bi-directional shaving head cartridge 34.<br>
Referring now to Figure 3C, there is illustrated a cut-away side view of a unidirectional embodiment of the embodiment of Fig. 3A, generally designated 40.   This embodiment shows a unidirectional razor for shaving, with a replaceable shaving head cartridge. The shaving blades 41 are affixed to the-front 42 of the replaceable unidirectional shaving head cartridge 43 which is connected to the ring shaped handle 15 via a latch and catch arrangement 44 &amp; 45 between the base of the replaceable unidirectional shaving head cartridge 43 and the top of the short neck 16.<br>
Referring now to Figure 4 there is illustrated an assembly view of a third alternate embodiment of the rolling razor, generally designated 50. In this embodiment a dual latch and catch system is used to support two opposite slide-on blade cartridges 51. Each slide-on blade cartridges 51 has a pair of razor blades 52 affixed therein, a latch 53 formed at the base of each slide-on blade cartridges 51 mates with the a catch 54 affixed to, or formed as part of, the top of the short neck 16, by sliding the slide-on blade cartridges 51 along the<br><br><br>
line of arrow 203 each new cartridge may be added. A stopping catch (not shown) limits the insertion of the slide-on blade cartridges 51 to a pre-selected distance on the short neck 16. Reversing the process allows the user to replace the slide-on blade cartridges 51. The short neck 16 is formed as part of, or attached to, the ring shaped handle 15 thereby completing the device.<br>
Referring now to Figure 5 there is illustrated an assembly view of a fourth alternate embodiment of the rolling razor, generally designated 60. In this embodiment a dual horizontal latch and catch system 61, which mates with a Schick™ refill cartridge, is used to support two opposite latch-on refill cartridges 62. The dual horizontal latch and catch system 61 is known art and therefore a detailed description of its construction and usage is not included. Each refill cartridge 62 has a pair of razor blades 63 affixed therein. Each refill cartridge 62 mates with a horizontal latch and catch 61 thereby affixing the refill cartridges 62 to one end of a short hollow neck 64. Within the short hollow neck 64 is housed a part of the dual horizontal latch and catch system 61. A mounting lever 65, also known art, extends on each side of the short hollow neck 64. When engaged the mounting lever 65 urges a movement of the connected horizontal latch and catch to either grasp or release the refill cartridge 62. The short hollow neck 64 is affixed at one end to the ring shaped handle 15.<br>
Referring now to Figure 6 there is illustrated an assembly view of a fifth alternate embodiment of the rolling razor, generally designated 70. In this embodiment a dual vertical latch and catch system 71, which mates with a Gillette™ refill cartridge, is used to support two opposite latch-on refill cartridges 72. The dual vertical latch and catch system 71, is known art and therefore a detailed description of its construction and usage is not included. Each refill cartridge 72 has a pair of razor blades 73 affixed therein. Each refill cartridge 72 mates with a vertical latch and catch 71 thereby affixing the refill cartridges 72 to one end of a short hollow neck 74. Within the short hollow neck 74 is housed a part of the dual vertical latch and catch system 71. A mounting switch 75, also known art, extends on each side of the short hollow neck 74. When engaged the mounting switch 75 urges a movement of the connected vertical latch and catch to either grasp or release the refill cartridge 72. The short hollow neck 74 is affixed at one end to the ring shaped handle 15.<br>
Referring now to Figure 7 there is illustrated a cut-away side view of a sixth alternate embodiment of the rolling razor, generally designated 80. This embodiment shows an ovoid ring handle 81 with a bi-directional shaving head 82. The ovoid handle 81, which allows the user to choose the small radius curvature side of the ovoid handle 83 or the larger<br><br>
radius curvature side of the ovoid handle 84 depending on which best fits their hand and fingers. It is envisioned that a unidirectional shaving head mounted to the ovoid handle 81, would fall within the intended scope of this invention.<br>
Referring now to Figures 8 A and 8B there are illustrated cut-away side views of a seventh alternate embodiment of the rolling razor, generally designated 90.
