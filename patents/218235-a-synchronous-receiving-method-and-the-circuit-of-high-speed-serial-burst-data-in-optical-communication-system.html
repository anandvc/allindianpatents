				<td>Field of the Technology	<br>
The   invention   generally   relates   to in consistent with title a synchronous receiving method and the circuit of high speed serial burst data optical communication system  <br>
Specifically a method for synchronous receiving uplink data, which is high-speed  <br>
and at burst, on an optical communication system and a circuit thereof.	<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
It is necessary to have a special technique and method to deal with synchronization problem for uplink data when an ATM-passive optical network (A-PON) using high-speed time-division multiple access (TDMA) technology. For example, every asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) cell reaching an optical line terminal (OLT) needs to be synchronized roughly with ranging, but even though there is a non-integral bit gap between ATM cells. In this case, it is necessary to use bit synchronization for data alignment, and at the same time to make data bytes and cells synchronization. This is what the invention say a receiving problem for fast bit synchronization. Another example is that since uplink ATM cells come from different remote terminal and are at burst, so the synchronization needs to be made for each cell individually.<br>
During the synchronous receiving, mentioned above, in order to get a maximum time tolerance the sample clock at the OLT receiving end is positioned at the middle of the input data eye pattern. A usual positioning method is with the phase-locked loop (PLL) technique. In this technique, first a phase detector detects phases of the rising and falling edge of the uplink serial burst data and the sample clock to generate an "up" and "down" pulses; then these two pulses are sent to a "charge pump", and then the output voltage of the charge pump controls a voltage controlled oscillator (VCO) to generate a clock with appropriate phase.<br>
The disadvantages of the PLL technique are as fellow. First, with PLL technique it takes longer hang up time for getting a stable phase locking, this is not suitable for the high-speed burst characteristic of uplink data on the A-PON system. Secondly, it<br>
is difficult to design a phase detection circuit for phase detection of the uplink data with a high-speed serial burst and the sample clock. Thirdly, it is difficult to get small static phase error and dynamic phase error between the sample clock and the uplink high- speed serial burst data; for example, when dealing with delay, synchronous delay and non-linear characteristics of a phase detector, they all requires a low loop bandwidth to keep stability but in this case the circuit is impossible to trace the high-frequency noise.<br>
Another positioning method, which is used more often, is to make over-sample with a clock having four phases for the uplink data with high-speed serial burst. At the remote end, a special preamble code is added in the transmitted ATM cell head of uplink high-speed serial burst data; at the exchange end, if a clock has sampled the correct preamble code, the phase of clock is satisfied the phase requirement and selected as the synchronous clock, and then make sample of bit data, conversion of byte data and reversion of the cell etc.<br>
The disadvantages of this method are as fellow. First, the selected clock is not always positioned at the middle of the data eye pattern, so the time tolerance may be very little. Secondly, under high-speed application, it is difficult to satisfy requirements of the system. Thirdly, it is difficult to trace accurately the system phase noise.<br>

A synchronously receiving method and circuit of the invention for high-speed uplink data on an optical communication system is a fast bit-synchronization receiving method and circuit. The method uses multiphase clock to over-sample data and adapts the sampled data to the local clock. The method uses polarity-detecting circuit to simplify the successive circuits, and uses selecting logic circuit to select data that is sampled by the clock positioned at the middle of the eye pattern. The method adds a baker code as the preamble code for uplink high-speed serial burst data. The invention is for selecting data, not for selecting clock, and has a high-speed clock with frequency division as a byte clock.<br>
Comparing with the four phases clock sampling method for uplink burst data over-sampling, the method and circuit of the invention have the following advantages: having more phases clock with different phases attend over-sampling, so over-sampling granularity is smaller and it can trace system phase error effectively; it can select the clock at the middle of received data eye pattern reliably and accurately, so there is a max time tolerance for the circuit; the circuit uses pipeline mode without feedback, so calculating speed of the circuit can be raised greatly to satisfy the bit synchronization requirement of high-speed data; the circuit makes processing after the received data have been synchronized to the local clock, so the circuit is simple and without phase jitter and it is need not to have FIFO registers to make synchronization, and it will be easy for successive synchronous control; the circuit can send out directly high-speed frequency dividing clock, so there is no clock switching burr.<br>

Embodiments of the Invention<br>
The invention will be described in more detail with reference to drawings in the following.<br>
Figure 1 shows an uplink high-speed serial burst data sampling principle with eight-phase clock having different phases. The eight-phase clock Clk0 - Clk7 with different phases over-sample the uplink high-speed serial burst data; if all of the eight-phase clock ClkO - Clk7 have obtained sampled data correctly, then taking the data sampled by clocks Clk3 or Clk4 that are at the middle of the uplink high-speed serial burst data eye pattern as the data received normally.<br>
Figure 2 shows the basic principle of the method and the basic structure of the circuit. It includes: a multi-phases (eight-phases) clock generating circuit unit 21, a sampling circuit unit for uplink high-speed serial burst data 22, a baker code (one of the preamble codes) detecting circuit unit 23, a selecting logic circuit unit 24 and a byte and cell synchronization unit 25 that is the connection of a multi-path (eight-path) data selecting circuit unit 251, a synchronous signal selecting circuit unit 252 and a serial-to-parallel converter 253. In addition, the circuit has a clock frequency dividing circuit 26, of which the frequency division number relates to the number of parallel bits of the serial-to-parallel converter 253.<br>
The multi-phases clock generating circuit unit 21 generates clocks whose number equals to phases number needed, whose frequency equals to the bit rate of the uplink data and whose phase differences are equal. For example, when the speed rate of the uplink high-speed serial burst data is 155 Mbps and the external clock is 155 MHz, eight-phase clocks with 155 MHz and equal phase differences are generated, so the<br>
clock period is 6.4 ns and the phase difference between each two consecutive clocks is 1/8 external clock period, i.e. 0.8ns. The multi-phases clock circuit 21 can be constructed by a traditional PLL or digital locking loop (DLL). The eight clocks ClkO - Clk7 are outputted to the sampling circuit of the uplink high-speed serial burst data<br>
22.<br>
The sampling circuit unit of the uplink high-speed serial burst data 22 is consisted of eight-path sampling circuit that use the eight phases clock ClkO - Clk7 to over-sample the uplink high-speed serial burst data and obtain eight-path serial data, then the obtained data which are adapted to the local clock with 155 MHz by the converter for successive processing.<br>
Figure 3 shows one path (one phase) of the sampling circuit 22 that is consisted of three stages shown by three dot line blocks.<br>
First stage is the sampling stage 221 that over-samples, with shift mode, the uplink high-speed serial burst data with one of the eight-phase clock ClkO - Clk7 and obtains data corresponding to the used clock. The implementation of the first stage can be three stages registers connected serially to eliminate a sub-stable state and instability of receiving signal.<br>
Second stage is the adapting stage 222 that is used to adapt a over-sampled data to the main clock or said local clock (Mclkl55MHz) through Clk3, Clk4, Clk5, Clk6 and Clk7 or directly.<br>
Adapting to main clock is made with the following relationships, wherein data output of a register driven by the left side clock of an arrow —&gt; are sent to the data input of a register driven by the right side clock of the arrow.<br>
Clk0—&gt;Clk4—&gt;McIkl55M—&gt;Mclkl55M;<br>
Clkl—&gt;CIk5—&gt;Mclkl55M—&gt;Mclkl55M;<br>
Clk2—&gt;Clk6—&gt;Clk3—&gt;Mclkl 55M;<br>
Clk3—&gt;Clk7—&gt;Clk4—&gt;Mclkl55M;<br>
Clk4 —&gt;Mclkl55M —&gt;Mclkl55M;<br>
Clk5—&gt;Mclkl55M—&gt;Mclkl55M;<br>
Clk6 —&gt;Clk3 —&gt;Mclkl55M; Clk7 —&gt;Clk4 —&gt;Mclkl55M„<br>
It is known from the above relationships that data synchronized with eight-phase clock are finally adapted to the main clock or the local clock (Mclkl55MHz).<br>
Third stage is the shift stage 223 that is used to synchronize the output data of the adapting stages 222. The output data of every path have been adapted to the main clock respectively, and each of them is with different phase clock. The shift stage 223 is a shift register consisted of nine-stages register connected serially. The eight the shift stage 223 send low 8 bits serial data to the preamble code (baker code) detecting circuit unit 23, respectively, and also send the most significant bit (MSB) to the data selecting circuit unit 251, respectively, for data selection, as shown in Fig. 2.<br>
The preamble code (baker code) detecting circuit 23 also includes eight baker code detecting circuits that make preamble code detection respectively for the low 8 bits serial data outputted from the eight shift stage 223 to determine whether there is a correct data among the eight-path. Each baker code detecting circuit is consisted of a baker code comparative circuit and a polarity detecting circuit.<br>
Figure 4 shows detecting principle of the baker code detecting circuit. The baker code comparative circuit compares the arrived data with the baker code "11100101". In Fig.4, the arrows under the non-shaded area show the comparative procedure; when the bit of data is identical with corresponding bit of the baker code, the initial vector hit is set to "1", otherwise to "0". As shown in Fig.4, hitl and hit8 are "0" and hit2 -hit7 are all "1" (six "1"). During compare, when all bits are equal or only one bit is unequal to the baker code, it is determined that a baker code is detected. The compare goes on continuously hit8, hitl, hit2, ... hit7, hit8... and so on.<br>
The polarity detecting circuit is used to detect the rising edge and falling edge of the uplink high-speed serial burst data, and the result, replacing the sampled data, is sent to the successive circuits for further processing; in this way, the computation volume will be decreased and the further processing is simplified; therefore, the whole circuit can perform eight paths data processing under the 155 MHz clock. There are eight XOR gates that perform exclusive-OR operation for two consecutive baker code<br>
comparing results. In Fig.4, the comparing result "01000001" is sequentially stored in an eight bits Flag, which has a "0" LSB and "1" MSB in this example.<br>
It can be seen from Fig.4 that data in Flag have only two "1" bits that replace the six "1" bits of the initial vector hit, and this will simplify the successive circuits.<br>
The selecting logic circuit 24 makes operation for eye pattern of the 8&gt;
Reference to Fig. 5, the selecting logic circuit 24 includes a time sequence generator 241, a Flag A (first Flag) 242 consisted of register logic circuits, a Flag B (second Flag) 243 consisted of register logic circuits, a decoding logic A (first decoding logic) 244, a decoding logic B (second decoding logic) 245, a register A (first register) 246, a register B (second register) 247, an adder 248 (+) and a selector (SEL) 249 consisted of register logic circuits. The selecting logic circuit unit 24 takes the position "a" of first "1" in the Flag and position "b" of second "1" in the Flag to compute the number (a + b)/2-phase clock, which is positioned at the middle of eye pattern of correct data, through the adder 248 and selector 249. As shown in Fig.4, the position "a" of the first "1" in the Flag is 2 and the position "b" of the second "1" is 8, so the (2 + 8)/2 = 5, so Clk5 is positioned at the middle of eye pattern of the correct data.<br>
The main consideration for using selecting logic is intended to solve the problem that when the phase difference of clock is larger, a baker code will cross the border of the main clock period. When designing, it is necessary to consider that the decoding speed affects the successive bytes synchronization.<br>
The byte and cell synchronization unit 25 is consisted of a data selecting circuit 251, a synchronous signal selecting circuit 252 and a serial-parallel converter 253. The byte and cell synchronization unit 25 is used to perform selection, synchronization and serial-parallel conversion of the eight paths data to implement byte and cell synchronization. Under control of the selecting logic circuit 24, the data selecting circuit 251 selects one of the MSBs of the data sent respectively by the eight shift stages 223 of the data sampling circuit 22. Under control of the selecting logic<br>
Circuit 24, the synchronous signal selecting circuit 252 selects one of the eight paths data sent by the baker code selecting circuit 23 and outputs synchronously. Under control of clock frequency dividing circuit 26 and data selecting circuit 251, the serial parallel converter 253 converts the eight bits serial data of one path from output of the synchronous signal selecting circuit 252 to parallel data to implement cell synchronization; at the same time the clock frequency dividing circuit 26 generates the recovery clock of received data by using the local clock and sends out in accompanying with the synchronized byte and cell data. The implementation circuit will not be described in more detail, since it is a mature technique in this area.<br>
The method and circuit of the invention have been passed the system examination. It has been proved they are feasible and reliable under the 155Mbps; the dynamic range is, about 30dpand the error rate is less then lxl0"12, which satisfy the G.983.1 standard.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
