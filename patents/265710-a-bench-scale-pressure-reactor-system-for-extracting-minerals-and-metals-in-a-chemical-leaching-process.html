				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to a bench scale pressure reactor unit with data acquisition<br>
and control system for chemical leaching of minerals. More particularly, the<br>
invention relates to a bench scale pressure reactor system for extracting minerals<br>
and metals through a process of chemical leaching at elevated temperature and<br>
pressure.<br>
BACKGROUND OF INVENTION<br>
Beneficiation is a variety of processes whereby extracted ore from mining is<br>
reduced to particles that can be separated into mineral and waste, the former<br>
suitable for further processing or direct use. It may be conducted via a range of<br>
techniques including crushing, grinding, magnetic separation, floatation, gravity<br>
etc. Beneficiation enables operators to improve the quality of their end product<br>
and to enhance the overall processing performing of an ore. Accordingly,<br>
physical as well as chemical cleaning (beneficiation) processes have been<br>
explored. In physical cleaning, the mineral is crushed into suitable particle size,<br>
and the waste is removed in processes based on the differences in their physical<br>
properties. In contrast to physical cleaning, chemical processes involves addition<br>
of chemical which reacts with the mineral matter or waste and allow it to be<br>
easily removed. This includes mainly the process of liquid/solid extraction, also<br>
known as leaching, involves the transfer of a solute from a solid, generally<br><br>
employed in particulate form, to a liquid solvent which is termed as the 'extract'.<br>
In this process, the solid imbibes the solvent which dissolves the solute and<br>
thereby extracts it from the solid. Leaching is a very old process and a great<br>
diversity of apparatus has been developed over the years to meet the varying<br>
requirements of the process in respect to its widely diverse applications.<br>
Leaching equipment including pressure reactors are commercially available for a<br>
wide variety of processes, including fixed-bed processes in which solvent is<br>
percolated through a stationary bed of solids, moving-bed processes in which the<br>
solids are conveyed through the solvent with little or no agitation, and dispersed-<br>
solid processes in which the solids are dispersed in the solvent by mechanical<br>
agitation. Among the many critical problems involved in the successful operation<br>
of a leaching process are those associated with the fact that the solid material to<br>
be leached is often quite heterogeneous in character, and therefore exceedingly<br>
difficult to treat in an optimum manner.<br>
However, most of these reactors are operated at atmospheric pressure only, and<br>
hence, there is a limit on temperature to which the material can be treated. In<br>
most of the cases the maximum temperature limit in such reactors are less than<br>
the boiling point of the liquid being used for leaching out the solid materials.<br>
Besides, when pressure is applied, uniform mixing of the slurry inside the<br>
pressure reactor becomes a difficult proposition because of inadequate provision<br>
or lack of stirring.<br><br>
U.S. Patent No. 6613271 disclose an apparatus and method for recovering<br>
valuable metals particularly gold using an in line leach reactor. This invention<br>
states about the apparatus and method for continuously separating a dense<br>
valuable material such as gold from a feed including a grinding mill which directs<br>
a crushed feed through hydrocyclones for separation into a light and dense<br>
reaction. The fraction is concentrated further by in line pressure jigs inline and<br>
the concentrate is leached in a rotating leaching reactor. The resulting pregnant<br>
liquor is subjected to electrowinning to recover gold and the spent liquor is<br>
recycled.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 4824939 discloses about a novel leaching process which is useful<br>
for leaching a particular solid material that comprises extractable and<br>
nonextractable portions. The process includes the steps of introducing the<br>
particulate solid material and a liquid solvent to an extraction zone; against the<br>
liquid solvent to a degree sufficient to suspend the particulate solid material and<br>
effect segregation of particles thereof in relation to their propensity to settle;<br>
maintaining contact between the liquid solvent and the particulate solid material<br>
for a time sufficient to leach extractable material therefrom: and selectively<br>
withdrawing particles from the extraction zone. In a preferred embodiment, the<br>
leaching process is a multi-stage process employing a series of stages in which<br>
the selectively withdrawn particles from each stage are introduced to the next<br>
successive stage of the series.<br><br>
U.S. Patent No. 5993635 relates to a method enabling a sulphide mineral<br>
composition to be leached at atmospheric pressure instead of above atmosphere<br>
pressure which has been hitherto required in order to achieve acceptable rates of<br>
leaching.<br>
OBJECTS OF INVENTION<br>
It is therefore an object of the invention to propose a bench - scale pressure<br>
reactor system which allows the leaching liquids to leach out solid materials at a<br>
temperature above the boiling temperature of the liquid.<br>
Another object of the invention is to propose a bench - scale pressure reactor<br>
system, which allows extraction of multivarious minerals and metals through a<br>
process of chemical leaching at an elevated temperature and pressure.<br>
A still another object of the invention is to propose a bench - scale pressure<br>
reactor system, which enables evaluating detailed kineties, thermodynamics, and<br>
energy requirement for extraction of materials by carrying-out existing chemical<br>
leaching and/or the invented leaching process.<br>
SUMMARY OF INVENTION<br>
Accordingly, a bench scale pressure system is provided in which up to 0.5 kg of<br>
ore/minerals can be treated. This helps in optimization as well as scaling up the<br>
chemical leaching process at elevated temperature and pressure to a commercial<br>
scale. In the present case, an example has been given for brief methodology to<br><br>
be followed for carrying chemical leaching of coal using alkali and acid leaching<br>
method. However, this system can be used for chemical leaching of various other<br>
minerals using any other inorganic chemical including acid and alkalis. This<br>
system can be used for evaluating detail kinetics, thermodynamics and energy<br>
requirement for extraction of minerals using existing chemical leaching processes<br>
and also for development for new processes for extraction of other minerals<br>
using this leaching technique. Methodology, scientific background and few<br>
important test results using this system have been discussed in the subsequent<br>
sections.<br>

DETAIL DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION<br>
A schematic diagram of a bench scale pressure reactor system for carrying out<br>
chemical leaching method at elevated pressures and temperatures according to<br>
the invention, is shown in Fig. 1 The system comprises a batch reactor (1)<br>
having capacity of approximately, 5.0 liters with means for heating and<br><br>
continuous mixing; a cooling section/chilling device; means for applying pressure<br>
up to bar and a data acquisition and control means. The reactor (1) is of<br>
diameter ~ 7.0 inch and height ~10.0 inch having a conical bottom. The reactor<br>
(1) is made up of SS-316 material. The feed materials are charged inside the<br>
reactor (1) through a charging funnel (2) at the top by opening a first valve (VI).<br>
The products after completion of the reaction time are taken out by opening a<br>
third valve (V3). Pressure can be applied inside the reactor (1) through a second<br>
valve (V2) by using compressed air, nitrogen or argon. The inlet pipe (3) through<br>
which pressure is applied is having side arms (4) at different angles inside the<br>
reactor (1) and is extending up to end of the cylindrical part of the reactor (1).<br>
The side arms (4) and inlet pipe (3) are having perforations through which<br>
pressure is applied inside the reactor (1). This configuration facilitates continuous<br>
agitation and mixing of the reactants inside the reactor (1). A chiller unit (5)<br>
having one horizontal coil (5a), and one vertical coil (5b) is fitted at the top of<br>
the reactor (1) as shown in the schematic diagram. A pressure sensor (6) is<br>
connected with the reactor (1) to control the pressure inside the reactor (1). The<br>
pressure inside the reactor (1) is controlled by a control element called solenoid<br>
valve (V4), which acts as an ON-OFF control. The vertical coil (5b) present inside<br>
the chiller unit (5) is extending up to the top of the reactor (1) at one end and is<br>
connected to a pressure transmitter (7) on the other side through a condenser<br>
(8). The horizontal coil (5a) is connected to the solenoid valve (V4) through<br>
which pressure is released from the reactor (1) through control action as and<br>
when required. The chiller unit (5) can either be filled with ice or cold water<br>
which can be circulated continuously so that the coils (5a, 5b) do not get<br><br>
overheated. This is important as the pressure transmitter (7) or sensor (6)<br>
should never be exposed to very high temperature. The reactor (1) is heated<br>
with two heating coils of 1-kilowatt capacity each (not shown) which are fitted<br>
outside the circumference of the reactor (1). A Resistance Temperature<br>
Detectors (16) is mounted inside the reactor (1) to indicate and control<br>
temperature. There are two heating coils (not shown) each of 1 kw capacity to<br>
raise the temperature inside the reactor (1). These two heating coils (not shown)<br>
are mounted on the circumference of the reactor (1), which are well insulated<br>
from the surrounding. The RTD (16) is connected to a first PID controller (17)<br>
(Proportional Integral Derivative) through which the temperature inside the<br>
reactor (1) can be controlled using a relay switch connected to the heaters. A<br>
second PID controller (18) is used to control the pressure inside the reactor (1).<br>
The pressure transmitter (7) sends the signal to the pressure controller (6) which<br>
in turn sends the signal to the solenoid valve (V4) to open or close. There is a<br>
sensor (9) to sense the amount of current passing through the 'Live wire" which<br>
provides electricity supply to the two heating coils. The output from the device<br>
(current data) is sent to a host computer (10) for measuring the total energy<br>
consumption during the process using the calculation as mentioned below.<br>
Power (kwhr) = Power (kwhr) + Voltage (volt)*Current (ampere)<br>
Energy = (Power)/time<br>
The temperature, pressure and current data from a data acquisition module (11)<br>
can be seen on the host computer (10) through a graphical user interface<br><br>
developed particularly for this system. The details of the microprocessor based<br>
interfacing for the data acquisition is described later. The data acquisition<br>
modules (11), PID controllers (17, 18) (pressure and temperature), the current<br>
sensor (9) and batteries (12, 13) are placed inside a panel. Schematic views of<br>
the pressure control arrangement and means for data requisition and control<br>
along with the circuit diagram for the system are shown in Fig. 2 and Fig. 3<br>
respectively.<br>
Different sensors and modules adapted in the system<br>
Sensors:<br>
RTD temperature Sensor:<br>
The RTD (16) is a sensor that operates on the principle that the resistance of a<br>
metal like platinum increases with an increases in temperature at a specific rate.<br>
The Resistance Temperature Detector is often selected when accurate<br>
temperature measurements are required RTD's could be made of Copper, Nickel<br>
or platinum. Currently, Platinum is the industry standard for the material use in<br>
making RTD's. As long as the temperature relationship with resistance is<br>
predictable, smooth, and stable, the phenomenon can be used for accurate<br>
temperature measurement. To ensure high accuracy, the resistance effects due<br>
to impurities must be small and the resistance versus temperature curve must be<br>
known and repeatable. Platinum RTD's are suitable for use from -50C to 550C,<br>
when long-term temperature stability and repeatability is required. They offer<br><br>
virtually a linear response over this range. The details of the two data acquisition<br>
module (14,15) used in the present case has been described below.<br>
The Pressure Sensor (6)<br>
Pressure sensor (6) is a sensor that operates on the principle of capacitance. It<br>
consist of a diaphragm and two parallel plates. An insulating fluid is used to<br>
insulate the diaphragm from the reactor's vapour. Here mercy is used as the<br>
insulating fluid because its density is higher than normally used fluid. It can<br>
sense pressure range from 0-100 kg/cm2. When the reactor pressure acts on the<br>
insulating fluid it transmits the pressure to the diaphragm which changes the<br>
capacitance between the two plates. And due to the change in capacitance a<br>
change in potential difference develops across the plates that in turn give rise a<br>
change in output voltage.<br>
The Solenoid valve (V-4)<br>
The solenoid valve (V-4) is the final control element in this process. It works on<br>
the principle of Magnetic Induction Effect and is consisting of a plunger and a<br>
coil. It is operate in ON-OFF mode (i.e., at one time it is either ON or OFF). The<br>
operating voltage is 22-24 V dc. The moment voltage is applied the coil get<br>
energized and it pull the plunger inside. And as the applied voltage is removed<br>
the coil gets de-energized and releases the plunger to reach its original position.<br>
This effect is used to release and maintain pressure in side the reactor according<br>
to the control signal generated by the pressure controller.<br><br>
Modules<br>
7520 Module (14)<br>
This module (14) provides the necessary serial bus protocol conversion from PC<br>
standard RS 232 to a 2 wire RS 485 interface. This module (4) connects ail other<br>
modules on the RS 485 network. Its specification is :<br>
Input: RS 232C protocol<br>
Output: RS 485 protocol (2 wires, D+, D-)<br>
Baud rate : " Self Tuner" auto switching baud rate, 300 to 115200 bps.<br>
Modules : 256 modules maximum without repeater<br>
7017 Module (15)<br>
The 7017 is a 8-Channel Voltage and 4-20mA Input Module. It takes in an analog<br>
input. Eight different inputs can be given to this module at a time at Channel 0 to<br>
Channel 7. Its specifications is :<br>
Input type :mV, V, mA<br>
Input Range : +/-150 mV, +/-500mV, +/-1 V, +/- 5V, +/- 200mA<br><br>
Sample Rate: 10 samples per second<br>
Bandwidth :13.1 Hz<br>
Accuracy : 0.01% or better<br>
Methodology to be followed for chemical leaching of minerals in the<br>
bench scale pressure reactor system<br>
In the present case, an example has been illustrated for brief methodology to be<br>
followed for carrying out chemical leaching of coal using alkali and acid leaching<br>
method with the pressure reactor system. Here, West Bokaro fine clean coal was<br>
taken as a feed sample for this process. The feed sample can be taken directly or<br>
can be crushed to desired size fraction for improving the kinetics of the process.<br>
This West Bokaro fine clean coal is referred as feed coal in the subsequent<br>
section of this text and the clean coal produced from this process is referred as<br>
Product.<br>
Sample Preparation:<br>
200-300 gm of coal is taken through coning quartering method from the received<br>
West Bokaro fine clean coal. This coal sample is dried in an over at 105°C.<br><br>
Chemicals:<br>
Commercially available sodium hydroxide (NaOH) in combination with sulphuric<br>
acid (H2SO4) and HCI were used in the present method.<br>
The treatment process<br>
The chemical leaching were carried out in the reactor assembly using two steps.<br>
In the first step, feed coals (200-300 gm) were treated with varying<br>
concentration of alkali (NaOH) (2-3 lit) at varying temperatures under different<br>
pressure conditions for particular length of time in the reactor system described<br>
above. The treated coal is then washed repeatedly with water and/or HCI and<br>
then dried. Then, the treated coal is filtered, washed with water and dried before<br>
sensing for their chemical, Theological and petrographical properties.<br>
The coal to slurry ratio can be maintained at 1:10 or 1:5 keeping the total<br>
volume 2-3 liters. The Moment the feed is fed to the reactor (1), first the heater<br>
is switched on and then the data acquisition means (11) is switched on. The<br>
readings are checked in the host computer (10) using the GUI to ensure proper<br>
working of the sensors (6,7). Once checked, the data captured using the save<br>
command which saves the data to a text file. Pressure is applied inside the<br>
reactor (1) by opening the inlet valve (V2) for pressure as desired for the<br>
particular process. The treated coal samples are collected at the end of the<br>
process only once pressure inside the reactor (1) is released. The sample can be<br>
washed with water and/or 10-20% HCI/H2S04 solution. These samples are dried<br><br>
and analyzed for various properties. Multi-stage processes can also be carried<br>
out using the system.<br>
Experiments have been conducted at various pressure and temperatures. Few<br>
results are shown below for West Bokaro coal with 40% NaOH and 10% HCI<br>
washing.<br><br>
The product sample had nearly 5.5% ash.<br>
With the development of the present bench scale pressure reactor system, the<br>
chemical cleaning process can be carried out at high temperature and pressure<br>
using a bigger size reactor with jacketed steam heating or electric heating<br>
arrangement as described above. Detail thermodynamic and kinetic data<br>
evaluation as well as determination of energy requirement for this process can<br>
be achieved using the bench scale system. The will help in optimization as well<br>
as scaling up the chemical leaching process to and low ash coal can be produced<br>
economically for coke making. However, this system can also be used for detail<br>
kinetics, thermodynamics and energy requirement studies for extraction of any<br>
other minerals using existing chemical leaching processes, and for development<br>
of new processes for extraction of other minerals using this leaching technique.<br><br>
