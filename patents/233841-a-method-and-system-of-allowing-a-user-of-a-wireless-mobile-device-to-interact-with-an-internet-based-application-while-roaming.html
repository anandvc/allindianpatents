[0001]            TIns application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No.<br>
60/483,283, filed June 27, 2003, wInch is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002]             The present invention relates generally to techniques and a system for<br>
roaming across wireless networks. More specifically, embodiments of the invention<br>
allow for switcInng access across different networks from different network providers<br>
and/or different technologies.<br>
[0003]             In today's wireless mobile computing world, there are a variety of<br>
different mobile technologies that coexist for different applications and different<br>
ranges. Examples of some of these different technologies are discussed below in<br>
conjunction with Fig. 1 wInch grapIncally depicts several of the various technologies.<br>
[0004]             Shown in Fig. 1 are wireless wide area network (WWAN), wireless<br>
local area network (WLAN) and wireless personal area network (WP AN) technologies.<br>
WW AN technologies typically include cellular and related technologies such as GSM,<br>
GPRS, CDPD, CDMA, TDMA, WCDMA, etc. WW AN networks are Ingh power,<br>
long range networks that typically have an access range on the order of several<br>
kilometers on up. WLAN technologies, on the other hand, are medium power, medium<br>
range networks that have an access range on the order of tens of meters wInle WPAN<br>
networks are low power, short range networks that typically have an access range of<br>
about 10 meters or less. Examples of WLAN technologies include the IEEE 802.11(a),<br>
(b), (e) and (g) technologies and examples of WPAN technologies include Bluetooth,<br>
HomeRF, IrDA and IEEE 802.15 technologies.<br>
[0005]             The Internet and Internet-based applications can be accessed by different<br>
devices over each of the wireless network types shown in Fig. 1.  In order to access the<br>
Internet using a specific wireless network technology a computing device with<br>
appropriate hardware (e.g., antenna) and software (e.g., protocols) is required along<br>
with appropriate credentials (e.g., a user account) that are recognized by the network<br>
service provider. Except in some very specific cases, credentials that enable<br>
access to a network require a priory subscription to a service on the network or<br>
are based on a pay-as-you-go approach (typically for a set time period) where<br>
the user receives a temporary user ID that is authorized for use on the network.<br>
For example, in order to access a WWAN, a user typically needs a plan with a<br>
cellular data provider and in order to access a WLAN network, a user may need a<br>
subscription with a WLAN provider, a temporary account with a provider (e.g.,<br>
for network usage at an airport or coffee shop) or a relationsInp with a provider<br>
(e.g., for network usage at an airport or coffee shop) or a relationsInp with an<br>
enterprise network.<br>
US2002035699 discloses a method and system for enabling seamless roaming in<br>
a wireless network. A gateway server manages connections in a wireless local<br>
area network (WLAN). The gateway server provides context information, such as<br>
an IP address, that is stored after being previously allocated to a mobile device<br>
in a previous connection to the WLAN. The gateway server reassigns the IP<br>
address to the mobile device after it reconnects to the WLAN after a<br>
disconnection, thus providing seamless roaming for the mobile device from<br>
WLAN to WLAN (or subnets witInn one WLAN) without requiring the user of the<br>
device to re-register. The gateway server also provides cluster information (e.g.,<br>
as part of the context information) for a mobile device making a new connection<br>
to the WLAN, such as access privileges associated with the cluster of users of the<br>
mobile devices. The gateway server also provides load balancing among two or<br>
more WLAN's by directing a newly connection mobile device to another WLAN (or<br>
subnet), if less congestion results.<br>

US2003055977 discloses a system for automated, mid-session, user-directed,<br>
device-to-device session transfer system. A session transfer module of a session<br>
server provides the capability to a user to direct a transfer of an on-going session<br>
from one device to another device wInle maintaining the session. The session<br>
transfer module is invoked by a user in a way consistent with the user interface<br>
of the client application, including by a grapIncal user command, a command line<br>
prompt, or a voice command. The client provides a selection of possible devices<br>
that may receive the redirected session. The session transfer module receives<br>
the selected device with the session redirect command over a communication<br>
network. The communication network may be wired (e.g., public switched<br>
telephone network ("PSTN"), Internet, etc.,) a wireless network (e.g., digital<br>
telephone network, pager network, etc.,) or a combination of the wired and<br>
wireless networks. The session transfer module may be configured to discontinue<br>
the session with the current device and to block any subsequent messages of the<br>
transferring session from reacInng the device. The session transfer module may<br>
be further configured to access a device profile from a device profile database to<br>
convert the blocked messages into a format compatible to the format and/or<br>
modality of the redirected device. The session transfer module may be further<br>
configured to push the session to the redirected device in response to an<br>
activation (e.g., log-on) of the redirected device by the user. Alternatively, the<br>
session transfer module may be further configured to push the session back to<br>
the device in response to a time-out in the activation of the redirected device.<br>
However, the need for priority subscriptions and/or an existing relationsInp with<br>
network service providers according to the prior art limits the ability for individual<br>
user's of network services to roam from one network to another.<br>
BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Embodiments of the present invention allow a user of network services to roam<br>
from one network to another without necessitating a priory subscription with<br>
each of the networks. Roaming access can be acIneved through a single device<br>
that is able to connect to each of the different networks or through different<br>
devices where one device is able to connect to the first network technology and<br>
a second device is able to connect to the second network technology.<br>
Embodiments of the invention allow for switcInng among access across different<br>
networks from different network providers. Some embodiments of the invention<br>
allow seamless roaming across different networks from different providers wInle<br>
maintaining session and application state.<br>
In one embodiment the method comprises establisInng a connection between a<br>
wireless mobile device and a first wireless network. The connection allows the<br>
wireless mobile device to interact with an Internet-based application. A state of<br>
interaction between the wireless mobile device and the Internet-based<br>
application is tracked. The connection between the wireless mobile device and<br>
the first wireless network is terminated. The method further includes establisInng<br>
a connection between the wireless mobile device and a second wireless network<br>
and sending, to the Internet-based application, data representing a state of<br>
interaction of the wireless mobile device with the Internet-based application prior<br>
to terminating the connection between the wireless mobile device and the first<br>
wireless network.<br>
In another embodiment, the method comprises establisInng a connection to a<br>
first wireless network with a mobile device, suing the mobile device to interact...<br>
with an Internet-based application through the first wireless network, tracking data<br>
related to a state of interaction with the Internet-based application, establisInng a<br>
connection to a second wireless network with the mobile device, and sending data<br>
related to the state of interaction with the Internet-based application to the Internet-<br>
based application.<br>
(0010]            In a tInrd embodiment, the method comprises establisInng a connection<br>
between a wireless mobile device and a first wireless network. The connection allows<br>
the first wireless mobile device to interact with an Internet-based application. The<br>
method further comprises tracking a state of interaction between the first wireless<br>
mobile device and the Internet-based application, terminating the connection between<br>
the first wireless mobile device and the first wireless network, establisInng a connection<br>
between a second wireless mobile device and a second wireless network. The second<br>
mobile device is different from the first wireless mobile device. Data representing a<br>
state of interaction of the first wireless mobile device with the Internet-based<br>
application prior to terminating the connection between the first wireless mobile device<br>
and the first wireless network is sent to the Internet-based application.<br>
[0011]             In a fourth embodiment, a system for facilitating roaming from one<br>
network to another is disclosed. The system comprises an authentication component<br>
configured to authenticate wireless mobile devices for use on a plurality of wireless<br>
networks and a synchronization manager component. The synchronization<br>
management component is configured to track a state of interaction between a wireless<br>
mobile device and an Internet-based application through a first wireless network, and in<br>
response to receiving an appropriate request, establish a session between the wireless<br>
mobile device and the Internet-based application through a second wireless network<br>
and send data representing the state of interaction to the Internet-based application.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0020]             Fig. 2 is a block diagram of a system that allows mobile devices to roam<br>
across different networks according to one embodiment of the invention. Shown in<br>
Fig. 2 are mobile devices 10, 12 and 14 that access Internet 30 through one or more of<br>
networks 20, 22. Mobile devices 10,12, and 14 may be, for example, wireless-<br>
equipped laptop computers, internet-capable cellular phones, wireless-equipped<br>
personal digital assistants (PDAs) or any other mobile computing device that is able to<br>
connect to a wireless network to access one or more Internet-based services through the<br>
network. Networks 20 and 22 may rely on differing technology and/or use different<br>
service providers to enable mobile devices to connect to the networks. In some<br>
embodiments networks 20 and 22 can be different technologies deployed by the same<br>
or different service providers, different cells using the same technology but operated by<br>
different service providers, or can be different cells using the same technology and<br>
service provider.<br>
[0021]             Networks 20 and 22 may be based on any of the technologies shown in<br>
Fig. 1 or on any other appropriate wireless network technology. As examples, in one<br>
embodiment, network 20 may be a cellular based 3G WWAN network and network 22<br>
may be an 802.11(b) WLAN network. In another embodiment network 20 may be a<br>
802.11(g) WLAN network operated by company X and network 22 may be a 802.11(g)<br>
WLAN network operated by company Y.<br>
4<br>
[0022]            As shown in Fig. 2, mobile device 10 is equipped with hardware that<br>
enables the device to access Internet 30 through network 20; mobile device 12 is<br>
equipped with hardware that enables the device to access Internet 30 through network<br>
22 and mobile device 14 is equipped with hardware that enables the device to access<br>
Internet 30 through either network 20 or network 22. Also shown in Fig. 2 are a<br>
computer system/server 40 for a universal wireless network provider (UWNP) and an<br>
application server 50. UWNP 40 includes an authentication component 42 that<br>
authenticates mobile devices, such as mobile devices 10, 12 and 14 across multiple<br>
networks such as networks 20 and 22 and a synchronization manager 44 that tracks the<br>
state of interaction between a wireless mobile device and various Internet-based<br>
applications the device is being used to interact with.<br>
[0023]             Application server 50 hosts one or more applications that are accessed<br>
over the web by computing devices such as personal computers and mobile devices 10,<br>
12 and 14. Application server 50 may include multiple servers in a distributed<br>
computing system. In some embodiments, server 50 may implement one or more<br>
virtual private networks. A person of skill in the art will appreciate that there are<br>
thousands of different application servers in addition to application server 50 that can<br>
be accessed over the Internet providing thousands of different services and/or<br>
applications for use by computing devices such as mobile devices 10, 12 and 14.<br>
[0024]             Embodiments of the invention allow mobile devices to roam across<br>
multiple networks, for example from network 20 to network 22, such that a connection<br>
to an Internet-based application, such as an application supported by application server<br>
50, that is initially established through a first network can be switched so that the<br>
connection is established through a second network. In some embodiments, the switch<br>
of the connection may be implemented to minimize the impact to the user of the<br>
network switch. In some cases, the user may not even notice that a connection change<br>
occurred. The connection may be switched during a single session in wInch the mobile<br>
device is continuously connected to Internet 30, may be switched from a first session to<br>
a subsequent, second session where the mobile device is disconnected from Internet 30<br>
for a time period and then reconnected in the second session at the same application<br>
state at wInch the device was disconnected from Internet 30 during the first session or<br>
may be switched from a first session to a subsequent, second session where different<br>
mobile devices are used to connect to Internet 30 during each session.<br>
[0025]             In some embodiments, users (e.g., owners of the mobile devices) may be<br>
required to register with UWNP 40 or otherwise be registered with UWNP 40 through<br>
other mechanisms. In some instances, the registration may be done on behalf of the<br>
user (e.g., the service provider may register the mobile device with the UWPN).<br>
Authentication component 42 of UWNP 40 authenticates the mobile device for usage<br>
on the networks. By way of example, in one embodiment, the mobile device may be<br>
authenticated by comparing a device ID to a database of device IDs that are registered<br>
with the UWNP 40.<br>
[0026]             UWNP 40 also includes a synchronization manager 44 that provides<br>
session management services that enable roaming to be smoothly transitioned from one<br>
network to a second network for applications that are written to allow for such. The<br>
synchronization manager is a software program/engine that maintains the state of all<br>
active applications to support various roaming modes allowed by embodiments of the<br>
invention. In some embodiments the synchronization manager maybe a program that<br>
executes on the mobile device (not shown in Fig. 2) rather than on the server-side.<br>
Also, in some embodiments the synchronization manager (or another software<br>
component executing on a UWNP server) provides identity management features that<br>
enable a user to project a single identity for Inmself to a service provider or application<br>
even when the user is accessing the network using different user names (e.g., a personal<br>
identity or a work identity) or different mobile devices (e.g., a wireless laptop computer<br>
or a cell phone).<br>
[0027]             The state of the interaction may be preserved by capturing a user's<br>
interaction events with a data model.   For instance, the data model may represent the<br>
structure of a web form (e.g., an XForms data model) and the user interaction events<br>
may represent the user's interaction with the form. The interaction events may be<br>
captured and interpreted as to how the interactions affect the data model associated<br>
with the interaction. For instance, each character entered in a data field of a form<br>
affects the data model. At periodic intervals, the information may be stored and sent or<br>
otherwise synchronized with the synchronization manager. In one embodiment, the<br>
impact of a user's interactions may be stored as an XForms data model and periodically<br>
synchronized with a repository associated to the user session in the synchronization<br>
manager. Both interaction events and data model may be captured, stored, and<br>
synchronized with different granularities. By way of example, interactions may be<br>
captured each time an event occurs (event based), when a field is filled and an off focus<br>
event is received (field based), after several fields are filled (block based), at a form or<br>
page event, such as when a form is completed, or at other appropriate points in a user's<br>
interaction with a data model.<br>
[0028]            Some embodiments of the invention allow for three different modes of<br>
roaming: (1) suspend and resume mode; (2) connect/intermittently<br>
disconnected/disconnect mode and (3) multi-device roaming. Internet-based<br>
applications can be written to support one or more of the above roaming modes. Other<br>
modes and programming models that support a seamless switch between devices and/or<br>
networks can be implemented in other embodiments of the invention. Suspend and<br>
resume mode and connect intermittently disconnected/disconnect mode can be<br>
supported by a synchronization manager that executes on either the device side or<br>
server side of the system. Multi-device roaming, however, may require that the<br>
synchronization manager execute on the server-side of the system or somewhere in the<br>
network accessible from the different networks/devices that are used. Alternately, the<br>
state of the interaction that is saved on the first device may be transmitted to the second<br>
device.<br>
[0029J            Applications that support suspend and resume mode allow the<br>
application to be interrupted and subsequently resumed at the interrupted state at a later<br>
time using a different network (e.g., through an access network based on a different<br>
technology) or a different mobile device. In some embodiments, applications can be<br>
written to support a granular suspend and resume mode where they can be interrupted<br>
at any time but resumed only at specific points in the program. As one example of<br>
suspend and resume mode, if a user is completing an electronic form that requires the<br>
user to enter Ins first and last name, home address, home phone number and email<br>
address along with other information on a web site, the synchronization manager saves<br>
the data model requested by the web site (i.e., the form) and tracks information the user<br>
enters into the form with mobile device 60. If the user's session is interrupted prior to<br>
completing the form, for example the user enters Ins first and last name and Ins address<br>
but not Ins home phone number, email address or other information, synchronization<br>
manager may maintain sufficient information so that when the user's connection with<br>
the website is reestablished, the form can be pulled back on an active screen with the<br>
user's name and address information reentered into the form by the synchronization<br>
manager so the user only has to complete the remaining phone number, email address<br>
and other fields of the form. In some embodiments, the user may be given the option<br><br>
whether to resume the form completion before the form is displayed on an active<br>
screen.<br>
[0030]             Applications that support connect/disconnect mode allow seamless<br>
roaming to be used when part of the application executes on the mobile device and part<br>
of the application executes on an application server 50 accessed through the Internet.<br>
Examples of such applications include applications that run on an embedded web server<br>
and have client-side logic that can emulate part of the application business logic on the<br>
client when the network is absent. Typically, the client business logic interacts with a<br>
local, client-side data store or repository. When the network is on, the data store after<br>
being updated by the business logic is synchronized with the backend data. Updates on<br>
the backend can be synchronized with the client using push technology, for example,<br>
upon an event or change, periodically by the client, or upon initiation from the client.<br>
Such applications often have additional mechanisms to deal with conflicts. Examples<br>
of such applications include Oracle's Web-to-Go, wInch is collection of components<br>
and services that facilitates development, deployment, and management of mobile Web<br>
applications, and the Blackberry™ email service.<br>
[0031]             In an application that supports multi-device roaming, the user can switch<br>
from a first mobile device 10 that accesses the application through a first network, such<br>
as network 20, to a second mobile device 12 that accessed the application through a<br>
second network, such as network 22 wInle interacting with the application. The switch<br>
from mobile device 10 to mobile device 12 may include, for example, switcInng from a<br>
WAP phone that accesses an application through a WAP browser to a wireless PDA or<br>
kiosk that accesses the application through an XHTML (extended HTML) browser. As<br>
another example, a user may switch from a device that interacts with an application<br>
through a grapIncal user interface agent to a device that interacts with the application<br>
through a voice user agent. Multi-device roaming for other deployments of<br>
applications that use multi-modal interactions may also be supported by<br>
synchronization manger 44.<br>
[0032]             Similar to suspend and resume mode, applications that support multi-<br>
device roaming can be written with different levels of granularity. Implementing multi-<br>
device roaming, however, requires that synchronization manager 45 be deployed on the<br>
server side (e.g., at UWNP 40) as opposed to solely on the mobile device itself.<br>
[0033]             Once a user is registered with a UWNP, a user may log onto a network<br>
associated with the UWNP to establish a first connection and establish the terms of the<br>
usage (e.g., the cost structure of the connection). The user may then wander into the<br>
range of a second network that is also associated with the UWNP and roam from the<br>
first network to the second network. Alternatively, the user may disconnect from the<br>
first network and subsequently connect to the second network. As used herein, a<br>
network is associated with the UWNP if there is some mechanism and/or agreement<br>
between the UWNP and an owner of the network for billing a user for use of the<br>
network through the UWNP.<br>
[0034]             One specific embodiment of the invention is described below in<br>
conjunction with Figs. 3A, 3B and 4, where Figs. 3A and 3B schematically illustrate a<br>
sequence of events associated with a user logging onto a first network and roaming<br>
from the first network to a second network and Fig. 4 is a flow chart illustrating steps<br>
associated with the roaming process. For purposes of illustration only, the embodiment<br>
discussed with respect to Figs. 3 A, 3B and 4 can be envisioned to allow an individual<br>
on a business trip with a laptop computer (mobile device 60) that includes an 802.11(b)<br>
wireless network card to access the Internet from multiple locations using different<br>
networks witInn an airport.   For example, the user may access the Internet from a first<br>
802.11(b) network 62 in a frequent flyer lounge area and then roam to a second<br>
802.11(b) network 64 located in an airport coffee shop prior to leaving the airport.<br>
[0035]             Referring to Figs. 3 A and 3B, networks 62 and 64 each have servers 66,<br>
68 that handle login requests to the networks and interface computers on the networks<br>
to the Internet. Upon entering the range of network 62, mobile device 60 receives a<br>
request 70 from server 66 to login to network 62 (Fig. 4, step 100). Request 70 may be<br>
generated by the internet service provider (ISP) or mobile network operator (MNO) that<br>
runs network 62 from its server 66. In response to request 70, mobile device 60 may<br>
initiate an automatic or manual login process to network 62 (Fig. 4, step 102). Either<br>
process may include, for example, passing user identification information via a<br>
response 72 that enables UWNP 40 to authenticate device 60 for a connection to<br>
network 62.<br>
[0036]             In response to receiving identification information from device 60,<br>
server 66 sends a request 74 to UWNP 40 to check for billing authorization to establish<br>
that device 60 has an account with UWNP 40 and can thus be billed for usage of<br>
network 62 through UWNP 40 (Fig. 4, step 104).  UWNP 40 authenticates device 60<br>
and sends a response 76 back to server 66 indicting that device 60 is an approved client<br>
(Fig. 4, step 106) and server 66 then forwards appropriate credentials to device 60 via a<br>
response 78 (Fig. 4, step 108). Logging into network 62 implies that the user will be<br>
billed and pay for usage of the network. Billing/payment can be done with a credit card<br>
or any other billing approach accepted for mobile communications.<br>
[0037]             Once authorization is obtained to use network 62, device 60 can remain<br>
connected to the network and access content from outside of the network (e.g., content<br>
over the Internet) for the duration of a session as long as the device is witInn the<br>
wireless range of network 62 (Fig. 4, step 109).<br>
[0038]             At the end of a session on network 62, server 66 can pass usage<br>
information (e.g., the time that device 60 was connected to network 62) to UWNP 40<br>
(Fig. 4, step 110) in order to facilitate subsequent billing for the connection or to<br>
allocate money already paid by the user of device 60 to the UWNP to the ISP/MNO<br>
associated with network 62.<br>
[0039]             WInle mobile device 60 is accessing an application over the Internet<br>
(step 109), such as an application hosted by server 50 shown in Fig. 2, through network<br>
62, the synchronization manager (not shown in Figs. 3 A or 3B) tracks the state of any<br>
and all applications run by the mobile device. In some embodiments, the state of<br>
interaction in an Internet-based application is only tracked if the application is<br>
registered with the UWNP to allow for such tracking. The information tracked by<br>
synchronization manager 44 can be subsequently used to re-establish a session with an<br>
appropriate Internet-based application on a new network or with a new device as<br>
described below. Depending on the granularity of data tracking supported by the<br>
Internet-based application, the session can be reestablished at exactly the same point<br>
where the connection was terminated (i.e., the invention allows for seamless roaming)<br>
or can be established at some other previously acIneved point of interaction.<br>
[0040]             In some embodiments the synchronization manager or a separate<br>
identity management software component 46 also tracks the state of a user's interaction<br>
with an application when employing different identities on different networks. For<br>
example, a user may have an identity (user ID) such as Johnl23 on network 62 that is<br>
not available on network 64 because either network 64 requires a different format for<br>
user identities or that particular identity was already used by another user on network<br>
64. In such a case when the user roams from network 62 to network 64, an application<br>
that expects the user to have a particular identity may reject a new identity assigned by<br>
network 64. Identity manager component 46 of UWNP 40, however, communicates to<br>
the application via a cookie added to the message (that provides the appropriate<br>
identity) or other accepted approach (e.g., exchange between service or application that<br>
provides claims or credentials or that maps the identity of an identity known by the<br>
service) a single identity. In one embodiment tIns is done by storing a table for each<br>
registered user that tracks various identities of the user as known to different networks<br>
the user may access the Internet with, as known to different devices the user may access<br>
the Internet from and as known to different web sites the user has established identities<br>
with. In other embodiments federation solutions like Liberty Alliance (see<br>
http://www.piojectliberty.org) or WS-Federation (a specification by IBM® and<br>
Microsoft® for sharing user and macInne identities among disparate authentication and<br>
authorization systems) can be used to address these issues.<br>
[0041]             When device 60 enters the range of network 64 owned or operated by a<br>
different ISP/MNO than network 62, server 68 sends a request 82 to device 60 that the<br>
device login to network 64 (Fig. 4, step 112). In response to request 82, mobile device<br>
60 may initiate an automatic or manual login process to network 64 that includes a<br>
response 84 (Fig. 4, step 114) similar to the process described above in conjunction<br>
with step 102. Accordingly, response 84 may include user identification information<br>
that enables UWNP 40 to authenticate device 60 for a connection to network 64. In<br>
some embodiments the user will have already established rights to roam to other<br>
networks associated with the UWNP in wInch case authorization can be automatically<br>
provided without requesting payment information from the user. In other embodiments<br>
the user will need to accept a new payment plan/deal to use the new network.<br>
[0042]             In response to receiving identification information from device 60,<br>
server 68 sends a request 86 to UWNP 40 to check for billing authorization to establish<br>
that device 60 is authorized for use on network 64 or that the device can be<br>
appropriately billed for its usage of the network (Fig. 4, step 116). UWNP 40 sends a<br>
response 88 back to server 68 indicting that device 60 is an approved client (Fig. 4, step<br>
118) and server 68 then forwards appropriate credentials to device 60 via a response 90<br>
(Fig. 4, step 120) that enables device 60 to remain connected to network 64 and access<br>
content from outside of the network, for example, content over the Internet. Device 60<br>
can than access applications and/or information over the Internet through network 64<br>
wInle the device remains witInn the service range of the network (Fig. 4, step 121).<br>
[0043]             The synchronization manager allows the mobile device to continue any<br>
established interaction with an Internet-based application from step 109 in a manner<br>
such that the user may not notice a switch from the first network to the second network.<br>
In some embodiments upon logging onto the second network, UWNP allows the user to<br>
be presented with a list of applications that were being tracked from previous sessions.<br>
The user can then select wInch, if any, applications he would like to resume as if the<br>
interaction was a single continuous session. If the user selects to resume one or more<br>
of the possible applications, the synchronization manager passes sufficient information<br>
to the application so that the user resumes the application at the state at wInch he had<br>
previously left the application. During step 121, the synchronization manager is also<br>
tracking any new applications or updates to the state of existing applications so that<br>
such states can be resumed in any subsequently started session as described above in<br>
conjunction with step 109.<br>
[0044]             At the end of a session on network 64, server 68 passes usage<br>
information to UWNP 40 on the device's use of network 64 (Fig. 4, step 122) in order<br>
to facilitate subsequent billing for the connection to network 64 or to allocate money<br>
already paid by the user of device 60 to the UWNP to the ISP/MNO associated with<br>
network 64.<br>
[0045]             In some embodiments all exchanges between the UWNP and servers 66,<br>
68 as well as all authentication/authorization exchanges between device 60 and servers<br>
66, 68 are provided by secure web services such as SSL (secure sockets layer)<br>
communications. Also, in some embodiments, steps 102-108 and steps 114-120 may<br>
include one or more dialog boxes that allow the user to select from one or more<br>
different pricing schemes or packages. Similarly, there may be multiple ways to logon<br>
to an individual network such as network 62 or network 64. In such cases, a user may<br>
select in step 102 to logon to the network through UWNP 40 in wInch case a link to the<br>
appropriate login page of the UWNP is provided to the user in step 102.<br>
[0046]             A person of skill in the art will also appreciate that wInle in the example<br>
described above, as session on network 62 for device 60 terminated before device 60<br>
was logged into network 64 it is possible for the session on network 62 to terminate<br>
after, or in response to, a connection being established with network 64. Similarly, if<br>
device 60 is witInn range of both networks 62 and 64, the user of the device may select<br>
wInch of the two networks to run applications through based on any of a number of<br>
possible criteria, such as, usage cost, a preference for one network over another,<br>
strength of signal, etc. In other embodiments, the session on network 62 may be<br>
terminated independent of the possibility of establisInng a connection with network 64<br>
or any other network.<br>
[0047]             Some embodiments of the invention allow for multiple UWNP service<br>
providers. In such cases the user may select different UWNPs to access different<br>
network providers and different UWNPs can be trusted by different ISPs/MNOs. In<br>
one specific embodiment a federation of UWNPs can exist that follows predefined<br>
protocols for establisInng network identify information without compromising privacy<br>
and security of the information. An example of such identity protocols is described in<br>
U.S. Patent Application No. {{21756-8 case/OID 2003-005-01}}, wInch is hereby<br>
incorporated by reference.<br>
[0048]             In some embodiments, if the user who is registered with a first UWNP<br>
(UWNP B) seeks to login to a network where the MNO is only associated with a<br>
second UWNP (UWNP A) that is different from the first UWNP, but both the first and<br>
second UWNPs are in a federation, the authentication process requires an additional<br>
step where UWNP A seeks authentication of the user by the federation by passing a<br>
message to UWNP B. Fig. 5 illustrates one such embodiment.<br>
[0049]             Shown in Fig. 5, wInch is a block diagram that illustrates one<br>
embodiment of an authentication process involving multiple UWNPs, is a wireless<br>
network 130 controlled by an access provider, such as an MNO. When a user attempts<br>
to access network 130, a server on the network (not shown) sends a request for<br>
authentication to a server 132 associated with UWNP A. The server at UWNP A<br>
recognizes that the user is registered with UWNP B and is not registered with UWNP A<br>
and seeks authentication of the user from a server 134 associated with UWNP B. The<br>
results of the authentication process are ultimately passed back to the user through<br>
server 132 and 130. Once authentication is obtained, the user is then allowed to access<br>
a desired service or application hosted by a server 136 via the Internet.<br>
[0050]             In an embodiment where roaming will result in the user's interaction<br>
with an application being maintained at a particular state prior to the roaming, the<br>
synchronization manager interacts with the wireless mobile device and server hosting<br>
the application. As shown in Fig. 6, a synchronization manager 138 passes information<br>
related to the suspended state of the application to application server ] 36. By way of<br>
example, the information passed may includes user ED information associated with the<br>
session and, after the federation authorizes to pass the session, information associated<br>
to the user ID .<br>
[0051]             In further embodiments, the knowledge by the UWNP of a user's IP<br>
address and location (or other address information) can provide the capability to push<br>
notifications to the user from certain applications and/or improve universal messaging<br>
types of services. In one particular embodiment, the user may enter preferences with<br>
the UWNP as to the terms (e.g., where, when and how) such messages should be<br>
routed.<br>
[0052]             Having fully described several embodiments of the present invention,<br>
other equivalent or alternative methods of practicing the present invention will be<br>
apparent to those skilled in the art. For example, wInle certain embodiments discussed<br>
above illustrated use of the invention to allow for roaming across two different<br>
networks, the invention is able to allow roaming across three or even many more<br>
networks. Also, wInle the present invention has been described using a particular<br>
combination of hardware and software, it should be recognized that other combinations<br>
of hardware and software are also witInn the scope of the invention. These and other<br>
embodiments as well as alternatives and equivalents to the invention will be<br>
recognizable to those of skill in the art after reading the description of the present<br>
invention. The scope of the invention should not, therefore, be determined solely by<br>
reference to the above description, but instead should be determined with reference to<br>
the appended claims along with their full scope of equivalents and alternatives.<br>
