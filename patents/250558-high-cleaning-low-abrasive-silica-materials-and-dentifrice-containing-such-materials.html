				<td>Field of the Invention<br>
This invention relates to unique abrasive and/or thickening materials that are in<br>
situ generated compositions of precipitated silicas and silica gels. Such compositions<br>
exhibit different beneficial characteristics depending on the structure of the composite in<br>
situ generated material. With low structured composites (as measured via linseed oil<br>
absorption levels from 40 to 100 ml oil absorbed/100g composite), simultaneously high<br>
pellicle film cleaning properties and moderate dentin abrasion levels are possible in order<br>
to accord the user a dentifrice that effectively cleans tooth surfaces without detrimentally<br>
abrading such surfaces. Increased amounts of high structure composite materials tend to<br>
accord greater viscosity build and thickening benefits together with such desirable<br>
abrasion and cleaning properties, albeit to a lesser extent than for the low structure types.<br>
Thus, mid-range cleaning materials will exhibit oil absorption levels from an excess of<br>
100 to 150, and high thickening/low abrasion composite exhibit oil absorption properties<br>
in excess of 150. Such an in situ, simultaneously produced precipitated silica/silica gel<br>
combination provides such unexpectedly effective low abrasion and high cleaning<br>
capability and different thickening characteristics as compared to physical mixtures of<br>
such components. Encompassed within this invention is a unique method for making<br>
such gel/precipitated silica composite materials for such a purpose, as well as the<br>
different materials within the structure ranges described above and dentifrices comprising<br>
such.<br><br>
Docket No. 02-218C<br>
Background of the Prior Art<br>
An abrasive substance has been included in conventional dentifrice compositions<br>
in order to remove various deposits, including pellicle film, from the surface of teeth.<br>
Pellicle film is tightly adherent and often contains brown or yellow pigments which<br>
impart an unsightly appearance to the teeth. While cleaning is important, the abrasive<br>
should not be so aggressive so as to damage the teeth. Ideally, an effective dentifrice<br>
abrasive material maximizes pellicle film removal while causing minimal abrasion and<br>
damage to the hard tooth tissues. Consequently, among other things, the performance of<br>
the dentifrice is highly sensitive to the extent of abrasion caused by the abrasive<br>
ingredient. Conventionally, the abrasive cleaning material has been introduced in<br>
flowable dry powder form to dentifrice compositions, or via redispersions of flowable dry<br>
powder forms of the polishing agent prepared before or at the time of formulating the<br>
dentifrice. Also, and more recently, slurry forms of such abrasives have been provided to<br>
facilitate storage, transport, and introduction within target dentifrice formulations.<br>
Synthetic low-structure silicas have been utilized for such a purpose due to the<br>
effectiveness such materials provide as abrasives, as well as low toxicity characteristics<br>
and compatibility with other dentifrice components, such as sodium fluoride, as one<br>
example. When preparing synthetic silicas, the objective is to obtain silicas which<br>
provide maximal cleaning with minimal impact to the hard tooth surfaces. Dental<br>
researchers are continually concerned with identifying abrasive materials that meet such<br>
objectives.<br><br><br>
Synthetic silicas (of higher structure) have also been utilized as thickening agents<br>
for dentifrices and other like paste materials in order to supplement and modify the<br>
rheological properties for improved control, such as viscosity build, stand up, brush sag,<br>
and the like. For toothpaste formulations, for example, there is a need to provide a stable<br>
paste that can meet a number of consumer requirements, including, and without<br>
limitation, the ability to be transferred out of a container (such as a tube) via pressure<br>
(i.e., squeezing of the tube) as a dimensionally stable paste and to return to its previous<br>
state upon removal of such pressure, the ability to be transferred in such a manner to a<br>
brushhead easily and without flow out of the tube during and after such transference, the<br>
propensity to remain dimensionally stable on the brush prior to use and when applied to<br>
target teeth prior to brushing, and the exhibiting of proper mouthfeel for aesthetic<br>
purposes, at least, for the benefit of the user.<br>
Generally, dentifrices comprise a majority of a humectant (such as sorbitol,<br>
glycerin, polyethylene glycol, and the like) in order to permit proper contact with target<br>
dental subjects, an abrasive (such as precipitated silica) for proper cleaning and abrading<br>
of the subject teeth, water, and other active components (such as fluoride-based<br>
compounds for anticanes benefits). The ability to impart proper rheological benefits to<br>
such a dentifrice is accorded through the proper selection and utilization of thickening<br>
agents (such as hydrated silicas, hydrocolloids, gums, and the like) to form a proper<br>
network of support to properly contain such important humectant, abrasive, and anticaries<br>
ingredients. It is thus evident that formulating proper dentifrice compositions can be<br>
rather complex, both from a compounding standpoint as well as the number, amount, and<br>
type of components present within such formulations. As a result, although it is not a<br><br><br>
high priority within the dentifrice industry, the ability to reduce the number of such<br>
components, or attempt to provide certain components that meet at least two of these<br>
needed properties could potentially reduce formulation complexity, not to mention<br>
potentially reducing the overall manufacturing costs.<br>
A number of water-insoluble, abrasive polishing agents have been used or<br>
described for dentifrice compositions. These abrasive polishing agents include natural<br>
and synthetic abrasive particulate materials. The generally known synthetic abrasive<br>
polishing agents include amorphous precipitated silicas and silica gels and precipitated<br>
calcium carbonate (PCC). Other abrasive polishing agents for dentifrices have included<br>
chalk, magnesium carbonate, dicalcium phosphate and its dihydrate forms, calcium<br>
pyrophosphate, zirconium silicate, potassium metaphosphate, magnesium<br>
orthophosphate, tricalcium phosphate, perlite, and the like.<br>
Synthetically-produced precipitated low-structure silicas, in particular, have been<br>
used as abrasive components in dentifrice formulations due to their cleaning ability,<br>
relative safeness, and compatibility with typical dentifrice ingredients, such as<br>
humectants, thickening agents, flavoring agents, anticaries agents, and so forth. As<br>
known, synthetic precipitated silicas generally are produced by the destabilization and<br>
precipitation of amorphous silica from soluble alkaline silicate by the addition of a<br>
mineral acid and/or acid gases under conditions in which primary particles initially<br>
formed tend to associate with each other to form a plurality of aggregates (i.e., discrete<br>
clusters of primary particles), but without agglomeration into a three-dimensional gel<br>
structure. The resulting precipitate is separated from the aqueous fraction of the reaction<br>
mixture by filtering, washing, and drying procedures, and then the dried product is<br><br><br>
mechanically comminuted in order to provide a suitable particle size and size<br>
distribution.<br>
The silica drying procedures are conventionally accomplished using spray drying,<br>
nozzle drying (e.g., tower or fountain), wheel drying, flash drying, rotary wheel drying,<br>
oven/fluid bed drying, and the like.<br>
As it is, such conventional abrasive materials suffer to a certain extent from<br>
limitations associated with maximizing cleaning and minimizing dentin abrasion. The<br>
ability to optimize such characteristics in the past has been limited generally to<br>
controlling the structures of the individual components utilized for such purposes.<br>
Examples of modifications in precipitated silica structures for such dentifrice purposes<br>
are described in the art within such publications as U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,967,563, 3,988,162,<br>
4,420,312, and 4,122,161 to Wason, U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,992,251 and 5,035,879 to Aldcroft<br>
et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,098,695 to Newton et al., and U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,891,421 and<br>
5,419,888 to McGill et al. Modifications in silica gels have also been described within<br>
such publications as U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,647,903 to McGill et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,303,641, to<br>
DeWolf, II et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,153,680, to Seybert, and U.S. Pat. No. 3,538,230, to<br>
Pader et al. Such disclosures teach improvement in such silica materials in order to<br>
impart increased pellicle film cleaning capacity and reductions in dentin abrasion levels<br>
for dentifrice benefits. However, these typical improvements lack the ability to deliver<br>
preferred property levels that accord a dentifrice producer the ability incorporate such an<br>
individual material in different amounts with other like components in order to effectuate<br>
different resultant levels of such cleaning and abrasion characteristics. To compensate<br>
for such limitations, attempts have been undertaken to provide various combinations of<br><br><br>
silicas to permit targeting of different levels. Such silica combinations involving<br>
compositions of differing particle sizes and specific surface areas are disclosed in U.S.<br>
Pat. No. 3,577,521. to Karlheinz Scheller et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,618,488 to Macyarea et<br>
al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,124,143 to Muhlemann, and U.S. Pat. No. 4,632,826 to Ploger et al.<br>
Such resultant dentifrices, however, fail to provide desired levels of abrasion and high<br>
pellicle cleaning simultaneously.<br>
Another attempt has been made to provide physical mixtures of precipitated<br>
silicas of certain structures with silica gels, notably within U.S. Pat. 5,658,553 to Rice. It<br>
is generally accepted that silica gels exhibit edges, and thus theoretically exhibit the<br>
ability to abrade surfaces to a greater degree, than precipitated silicas, even low<br>
structured types. Thus, the blend of such materials together within this patent provided,<br>
at that time, an improvement in terms of controlled but higher levels of abrasiveness<br>
coupled with greater pellicle film cleaning ability than precipitated silicas alone. In such<br>
a disclosure, it is shown that separately produced and co-incorporated silica gels and<br>
precipitated silicas can permit increased PCR and RDA levels but with apparently greater<br>
control for lower abrasive characteristics than for previously provided silicas exhibiting<br>
very high PCR results. Unfortunately, although these results are certainly a step in the<br>
right direction, there is still a largely unfulfilled need to provide a silica-based dental<br>
abrasive that exhibits sufficiently high pellicle film cleaning properties with<br>
simultaneously lower radioactive dentin abrasive characteristics such that film removal<br>
can be accomplished without deleterious dentin destruction. In effect, the need is for a<br>
safer abrasive that exhibits a significantly higher PCR level versus RDA level than has<br>
previously been provided within the dental silica industry. Again, the Rice patent is<br><br><br>
merely a start toward desirable abrasive characteristics. Furthermore, the requirement to<br>
produce these separate gel and precipitate materials and meter them out for proper target<br>
levels of such characteristics adds costs and process steps to the manufacturing<br>
procedure. A manner of providing the benefits of such combinations, but to a very high<br>
level of pellicle film cleaning and at a relatively low to moderate degree of dentin<br>
abrasion, with simultaneous facilitation of incorporation within dentifrice formulation are<br>
thus unavailable to the industry at this time.<br>
There is always a desire to limit the number of additives required for purchase,<br>
storage and introduction within dentifrice formulations. As such, the ability to provide<br>
simultaneous thickening and abrasive characteristics to avoid the addition of multiple<br>
components for such properties is an unmet need within the industry.<br>
Objects and Summary of the Invention<br>
It has now been found that modifications in the processes for producing<br>
precipitated silicas can result in the in situ simultaneous production of targeted amounts<br>
of silica gels therein, particularly those in which the final structure of the in situ generated<br>
composite can be controlled. Such a novel method thus permits the production of in situ<br>
generated gel/precipitate silica materials that provide excellent dentin abrasion and<br>
pellicle film cleaning capabilities within dentifrices or, in the alternative, such<br>
formulations that exhibit excellent thickening properties as well as desirable abrasive and<br>
cleaning properties through the introduction of such a singularly produced, stored, and<br>
introduced additive.<br><br><br>
In particular, the specific in situ formed composites exhibit very high levels<br>
pellicle film cleaning properties compared with lower radioactive dentin abrasion results<br>
such that the resultant materials can be added with other abrasive materials (such as lower<br>
structure precipitated silicas, calcium carbonates, and the like) for the dentifrice producer<br>
to target certain high levels of cleaning with lower abrasiveness thus providing the<br>
optimization of cleaning while providing a larger margin of abrasion protection to the<br>
ultimate user. It is also believed, without intending to be bound to any specific scientific<br>
theory, that the increased amount of silica gel within the final composite materials aids in<br>
providing narrower particle size ranges in order to contribute a controlled result of high<br>
cleaning and reduced dentin abrasion levels. As will be discussed in greater detail below,<br>
the physically mixed combination of such materials (i.e., not simultaneously produced<br>
within the same reaction) has been found to impart limited levels of such properties,<br>
namely the need to provide materials (particularly a precipitated silica component) that<br>
exhibits an extremely high, potentially deleterious dentin abrasion level in order to<br>
impart, at the same time, an acceptable high pellicle film cleaning level. The novel in<br>
situ generated precipitated/gel combination silicas unexpectedly provide a higher degree<br>
of pellicle film cleaning with a significantly lower dentin abrasion value, thus according<br>
the dentifrice industry not only a potentially more desirable lower abrasive material for<br>
better dental protection. It has been realized that the presence of varied amounts of such<br>
a silica gel component permits the benefit of the sharp edges exhibited by the gel<br>
agglomerates for abrasiveness, with the coexistence of variable levels of silica<br>
precipitates of different structures to accord an overall composite exhibiting one of three<br>
general properties: high cleaning, mid-range cleaning, or thickening/low cleaning. Such<br><br><br>
general properties are all dependent upon the structure of the overall gel/precipitate<br>
composite, as measured by linseed oil absorption (as noted previously). When produced<br>
in situ, such a resultant gel/precipitate material provides unexpectedly improved<br>
properties as compared with dry blends of such separately produced components. In such<br>
a manner, as one example for the high cleaning variation, it has been found that although<br>
the pellicle film cleaning level is quite high, in fact the resultant dentin abrasion level is<br>
limited, thereby imparting an excellent cleaning material without also imparting too high<br>
an abrasion level to the target dental substrate.<br>
Alternatively, but by no means any less important, is the ability to produce<br>
materials of silica-based components simultaneously within the same reaction medium<br>
that imparts dentin abrasion and pellicle film cleaning characteristics (albeit to a lesser<br>
degree than for those noted in the previous paragraph) and coexistent thickening<br>
properties in order to accord such beneficial results with a single additive. The ability to<br>
control the level of a silica gel in a final composite and/or the target high-, medium-, or<br>
low-structure of the precipitate component therein through modifications in starting<br>
material concentration and/or gel and/or precipitate reaction conditions provides the<br>
ability to control the overall cleaning, abrasive, and/or thickening characteristics of the<br>
composite itself. Thus, a composite exhibiting greater thickening and reduced but<br>
effective pellicle film cleaning characteristic will include either higher amounts of silica<br>
gel and/or higher amounts of high-structure precipitate such that the overall composite<br>
exhibits sufficiently high linseed oil absorption (greater than 150 ml/100 g material) to<br>
provide the target desired thickening/low abrasion properties. Thus, by controlling such<br>
silica gel/precipitate production parameters, it has been found that a single additive can<br><br><br>
provide these diverse cleaning, abrasion, and/or thickening properties without resorting to<br>
multiple additions of potentially expensive and/or difficult to incorporate materials for<br>
the same purpose.<br>
All parts, percentages and ratios used herein are expressed by weight unless<br>
otherwise specified. All documents cited herein are incorporated by reference.<br>
Accordingly, it is one object of the present invention to provide a precipitated<br>
silica and gel silica composite material providing improved pellicle film cleaning without<br>
an unacceptably high corresponding increase in dentin or enamel abrasion. Another<br>
object of the present invention is to provide a new method for the production of such<br>
effective precipitated/gel silica combinations wherein such materials are produced<br>
simultaneously and in situ, thereby permitting the proper ratios of such materials to be<br>
made during production of the materials, rather than during dentifrice production. Also<br>
an object of this invention is to provide an in situ generated precipitated/gel silica<br>
composite material wherein the linseed oil absorption levels exhibited thereby are within<br>
one of three ranges: 40 to 100 ml oil absorbed/100 g composite material for a very high<br>
cleaning material, greater than 100 and up to 150 ml/100g for a mid-range high cleaning<br>
material, and in excess of 150 for a cleaning/thickening/low abrasion material.<br>
Accordingly, this invention encompasses a method for producing simultaneously<br>
silica gels and precipitated silicas, said method comprising the sequential steps of<br>
a) admixing a sufficient amount of an alkali silicate and an acidulating agent<br>
together to form a silica gel composition; and without first washing, purifying, or<br>
modifying said formed silica gel composition,<br><br><br>
b) simultaneously introducing to said silica gel composition a sufficient amount<br>
of an alkali silicate and an acidulating agent to form a precipitated silica, thereby<br>
producing a precipitate/gel silica combination. Encompassed as well within this<br>
invention is the product of such a process wherein the silica gel amount present therein is<br>
from 5 to 80% by volume of the total precipitated/gel silica resultant simultaneously<br>
produced combination. Further encompassed within this invention are the composite<br>
materials listed above in the three ranges of oil absorption measurements, and dentifrice<br>
formulations comprising such materials as well as the product of the inventive process<br>
noted above.<br>
Generally, synthetic precipitated silicas are prepared by admixing dilute alkali<br>
silicate solutions with strong aqueous mineral acids under conditions where aggregation<br>
to the sol and gel cannot occur, stirring and then filtering out the precipitated silica. The<br>
resulting precipitate is next washed, dried and comminuted to desired size.<br>
Generally, as well, silica gels include silica hydrogels, hydrous gels, aerogels, and<br>
xerogels. Silica gels are also formed by reacting alkali silicate solutions with strong acids<br>
or vice-versa, to form a hydrosol and aging the newly formed hydrosol to form the<br>
hydrogel. The hydrogel is then washed, dried and comminuted to form the desired<br>
materials.<br>
As noted above, the separate production of such materials has historically<br>
required manufacture of these separate materials, and proper metering of the two together<br>
during the incorporation within a dentifrice formulation in such a way as to provide the<br>
desired cleaning/abrasion levels thereof.<br><br><br>
To the contrary, the inventive method for simultaneous production of such<br>
materials permits the producer to target a range of amounts of silica gel and precipitated<br>
silica components as well as structures of precipitated components to impart the desired<br>
level of cleaning/abrasion through controlled parameters during production, a significant<br>
difference from previous physicals mixtures (i.e., dry blends) of such materials through<br>
separate incorporation. Basically, the novel method entails targeting the amount of silica<br>
gel desired and specifically selecting certain reaction conditions in order to generate such<br>
a desired level during amorphous precipitated silica production.<br>
The inventive abrasive compositions are ready-to-use additives in the preparation<br>
of oral cleaning compositions, such as dentifrices, toothpastes, and the like, particularly<br>
suited as a raw material in a toothpaste making process. Furthermore, such silica<br>
products can be utilized in applications wherein sharp edges and lower abrasiveness may<br>
be desired, such as, without limitation, foam inhibitors within certain formulations, such<br>
as, without limitation, automatic dishwashing detergents. Additional potential uses of<br>
such materials include food carriers, rubber additives and carriers, cosmetic additives,<br>
personal care additives, plastic antiblocking additives, and pharmaceutical additives,<br>
without limitation.<br>

Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
The abrasive and/or thickening combinations used in the present invention are in-<br>
situ formed materials that can be readily formulated on demand with other ingredients to<br>
prepare oral cleaning compositions having a high cleaning efficacy without causing<br>
undue abrasion on tooth surfaces. The essential as well as optional components of the<br>
abrasive and/or thickening compositions and related methods of making same of the<br>
present invention are described in more detail below.<br>
General Production Method<br>
The silica compositions of the present invention are prepared according to the<br>
following two-stage process with a silica gel being formed in the first stage and<br>
precipitated silica formed in the second stage. In this process, an aqueous solution of an<br>
alkali silicate, such as sodium silicate, is charged into a reactor equipped with mixing<br>
means adequate to ensure a homogeneous mixture, and the aqueous solution of an alkali<br>
silicate in the reactor preheated to a temperature of between about 40Â°C and about 90Â°C.<br><br><br>
Preferably, the aqueous alkali silicate solution has an alkali silicate concentration of<br>
approximately 3.0 to 35 wt%, preferably from about 3.0 to about 25 wt%, and more<br>
preferably from about 3.0 to about 15 wt%. Preferably the alkali silicate is a sodium<br>
silicate with a SiO2:Na2O ratio of from about 1 to about 4.5, more particularly from about<br>
1.5 to about 3.4. The quantity of alkali silicate charged into the reactor is about 10 wt%<br>
to 80 wt% of the total silicate used in the batch. Optionally, an electrolyte, such as<br>
sodium sulfate solution, may be added to the reaction medium (silicate solution or water).<br>
Next, an aqueous acidulating agent or acid, such as sulfuric acid, hydrochloric acid, nitric<br>
acid, phosphoric acid, and so forth (preferably sulfuric acid), added as a dilute solution<br>
thereof (e.g., at a concentration of between about 4 to 35 wt %, more typically about 9.0<br>
to 15.0 wt %) is added to the silicate to form a gel. Once the silica gel is produced and the<br>
pH adjusted to the desired level, such as between about 3 and 10, the acid addition is<br>
stopped and the gel is heated to the batch reaction temperature, preferably between about<br>
65Â°C to about 100Â°C. It is important to note that after this first stage is completed, the<br>
produced silica gel is not modified in any way. Thus, this resultant gel is not washed,<br>
purified, cleaned, etc., prior to commencement of the second stage.<br>
Next, the second stage begins after the gel reaction temperature is increased, with<br>
the simultaneous addition to the reactor of: (1) an aqueous solution of the same<br>
acidulating agent previously used and (2) additional amounts of an aqueous solution<br>
containing the same species of alkali silicate as is in the reactor, the aqueous solution<br>
being preheated to a temperature of about 65Â°C to about 100Â°C. The rate of acidulating<br>
agent and silicate additions can be adjusted to control the simultaneous addition pH<br>
during the second stage reaction. This pH control can be used to control product physical<br><br><br>
properties, generally with higher average batch pH providing lower structure silica<br>
products and relatively lower average batch pH providing higher structure silica products.<br>
High shear recirculation may be utilized, and the acid solution addition continues until<br>
the reactor batch pH drops to between about 4 to about 9. For purposes of this inventive<br>
method, the term "average batch pH" is intended to mean the average pH obtained by<br>
measuring the pH level every 5 minutes during the precipitate formation stage and<br>
averaging the total aggregate over total time elapsed.<br>
After the inflows of the acidulating agent and the alkali silicate are stopped, the<br>
reactor batch allowed to age or "digest" for between 5 minutes to 30 minutes, with the<br>
reactor contents being maintained at a constant pH. After the completion of digestion,<br>
the reaction batch is filtered and washed with water to remove excess by-product<br>
inorganic salts until the wash water from the silica filter cake results in at most 5% salt<br>
byproduct content as measured by conductivity.<br>
The silica filter cake is slurried in water, and then dried by any conventional<br>
drying techniques, such as spray drying, to produce an amorphous silica containing from<br>
about 3 wt% to about 50 wt% of moisture. The silica may then be milled to obtain the<br>
desired median particle size of between about 3 Âµm to 25 Âµm, preferably between about 3<br>
Âµm to about 20 Âµm. Classification of even narrower median particle size ranges may aid<br>
in providing increased cleaning benefits as well.<br>
In addition to the above-described production process methodologies of<br>
precipitating the synthetic amorphous silicas, the preparation of the silica products is not<br>
necessarily limited thereto and it also can be generally accomplished in accordance with<br>
the methodologies described, for example, in prior U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,893,840, 3,988,162,<br><br><br>
4,067,746, 4,340,583, and 5,891,421, all of which are incorporated herein by reference,<br>
as long as such methods are appropriately modified to incorporate recirculation and high<br>
shear treatments. As will be appreciated by one skilled in the art, reaction parameters<br>
which affect the characteristics of the resultant precipitated silica include: the rate and<br>
timing at which the various reactants are added; the levels of concentration of the various<br>
reactants; the reaction pH; the reaction temperature; the agitation of the reactants during<br>
production; and/or the rate at which any electrolytes are added.<br>
Alternative methods of production for this inventive material include in slurry<br>
form such as, without limitation, procedures taught within U.S. Pat. No. 6,419,174, to<br>
McGill et al., as well as filter press slurry processes as described within and throughout<br>
U.S. Published Pat. Appl. No. 20030019162 to Huang.<br>
The inventive silica composite materials may be characterized and separated, as<br>
discussed above, into three distinct categories, dependent upon the linseed oil absorption<br>
ranges exhibited within each. The oil absorption test, discussed in greater detail below, is<br>
generally used to determine structures of precipitated silica materials as set forth in J.<br>
Soc. Cosmet. Chem., 29,497-521 (August 1978), and Pigment Handbook: Volume 1,<br>
Properties and Economics, 2nd ed., John Wiley &amp; Sons, 1988, p. 139-159. For this<br>
invention, however, it is important to note that such a test has now been utilized to<br>
determine the structure of the overall gel/precipitate silica composite instead. Thus, the<br>
three basic types of inventive materials are categorized as defined above, and as<br>
discussed in the following sections.<br><br><br>
The inventive in situ generated composites (also referred to as "combinations") of<br>
silica gel and precipitate are useful for various functions, including, without limitation,<br>
three primary types: i) high-cleaning, dental abrasives with correlative lower<br>
abrasiveness (with an RDA level of less than 250, for instance) than typical high-cleaning<br>
silica-based products; ii) mid-range cleaning dental abrasives with reduced high cleaning<br>
levels (as compared with the high cleaning materials from above), but much lower RDA<br>
measurements (at most about 150, for instance); and iii) thickening (viscosity-modifying)<br>
products that exhibit certain levels of cleaning and abrasiveness (such as an exhibited<br>
PCR of less than 90 and a measured RDA of below 80). Production of each type is based<br>
upon different factors, such as reaction conditions (e.g., temperature, agitation/shear,<br>
addition rates of reactants, amount of gel component, and the like), and concentrations of<br>
reactants (e.g., mole ratios of silicate to acid, as one example). These will be further<br>
delineated separately below.<br>
High-Cleaning Abrasive Materials<br>
The in situ process of this invention has surprisingly yielded, with selectivity<br>
followed in terms of reaction pH, reactant composition, amount of gel component, and, as<br>
a result, structure of the resultant gel/precipitate silica composite materials made<br>
therefrom, abrasive materials that exhibit exceedingly high pellicle film cleaning<br>
properties. Such high-cleaning materials may be adjusted to target lower radioactive<br>
dentin abrasion levels without compromising the cleaning benefits, again, through the<br>
production of certain low structure gel/precipitate silica composite materials. Such<br>
materials are exemplified below in Examples 4, 6, 7, 11, and 15, at least and show the<br><br><br>
ability to clean without detrimental exaggerated dentin abrasion (within dentifrice<br>
formulas 1, 3, and 4, for example). Such products may be utilized as the sole<br>
cleaning/abrasive component within a dentifrice or, in one potentially preferred<br>
embodiment, may be used as a supplement with other lower abrasive additives, for<br>
targeting an overall cleaning and abrasive level for a dentifrice formulation.<br>
For this high cleaning material, the gel component is present in an amount<br>
between 5 and 50% by volume of the ultimately formed gel/precipitate silica composite<br>
material (and thus the precipitated silica component is present in an amount of from 95 to<br>
50% by volume as a result). Although the amount of gel possible to form a high cleaning<br>
material may be as high as 50% of the composite material, preferably such an amount is<br>
much lower mainly because it was found that the higher the amount of gel present within<br>
a high cleaning material, the greater amount of low structure precipitated silica<br>
component required to be produced during the following phase. Thus, the overall amount<br>
of gel to be produced is preferably relatively low (from 10 to 25%, for instance). Such<br>
percentages of gel component actually represent the amount of silicate present during the<br>
production phases for each different silica material. Thus, a 10% gel measurement<br>
reflects the presence of 10% of the total silicate reactant volume within the reactor during<br>
which the gel is initially made (as one example). Subsequent to initial gel production,<br>
the remaining 90% silicate reactant volume is used for precipitated silica component<br>
production. It is important to note, however, that upon the initiation of the precipitate<br>
formation phase, some of the silicate may actually produce gel, but the determination of<br>
percentages of each component within the ultimately formed composite material does not<br>
reflect such a possibility. Thus, the percentages noted above are merely best estimates,<br><br><br>
rather than concrete determinations of final amounts of components. Such an issue exists<br>
within the remaining in situ gel/precipitate composite material categories as well.<br>
Generally, it has been determined that such specific high-cleaning abrasives may<br>
be produced through a method of admixing a suitable acid and a suitable silicate starting<br>
material (wherein the acid concentration, in aqueous solution, is from 5 to 25 %,<br>
preferably from 10 to 20%, and more preferably from 10 to 12%, and the concentration<br>
of the silicate starting material is from 4 to 35%, also within an aqueous solution), to<br>
initially form a silica gel. Subsequent to gel formation, sufficient silicate and acid are<br>
added (without any appreciable degree of washing, or other type of purification, or<br>
physical modification of the gel) to the formed gel for further production of varying<br>
structure (preferably low in structure, but other structures silica products may result<br>
during manufacturing as long as the overall structure is sufficient to accord the necessary<br>
levels of pellicle film cleaning) precipitated silica component desired for a high cleaning<br>
composite material to be formed. The pH of the overall reaction may be controlled<br>
anywhere within the range of 3 to 10, with a higher pH desired for low-structure<br>
precipitated silica production. It has been realized that in order to provide a high<br>
cleaning, moderate to low abrasive material through this process, the amount of gel is<br>
preferably lower (as noted above, from 10 to 30% by volume of the composite) and the<br>
amount of low structure precipitated silica is preferably relatively high (from 90 to 70%<br>
by volume of the composite). In order to exhibit the proper PCR and RDA levels<br>
associated with this category, the resultant gel/silica composite material must exhibit a<br>
linseed oil absorption of between 40 and 100 ml oil/100 g material.<br><br><br>
Broadly, the inventive high cleaning gel/precipitated silica combination generally<br>
have the following properties: 10% Brass Einlehner hardness values in the range between<br>
about 5 and 30 mg loss/100,000 revolutions, and, within a test dentifrice formulation (as<br>
presented below within the examples) RDA (Radioactive Dentin Abrasion) values<br>
between about 180 to about 240, and (within the same test dentifrice formulation) PCR<br>
(Pellicle Cleaning Ratio) values of 90 to 160, with a ratio of PCR to RDA within the<br>
range of 0.45 to 0.7.<br>
Mid-Range Cleaning Abrasives<br>
The in situ process of this invention has also surprisingly yielded, with similar<br>
degrees of selectivity followed in terms of reaction pH, reactant concentrations, amount<br>
of gel component, and, as a result, overall structure of the resultant gel/precipitate silica<br>
composite materials made therefrom as for the high cleaning materials described above, a<br>
method for producing a mid-range product (essentially reduced, but still relatively high,<br>
cleaning levels with lower abrasion levels) composites as well. Thus, selection of<br>
differing concentrations, pH levels, ultimate gel proportions, among other things, can<br>
produce gel/precipitate silica composite materials of overall medium structures in order<br>
to accord relatively high pellicle film cleaning results, with lower abrasive properties as<br>
compared with the high cleaning materials described above. Examples 5, 10, 12,14, 16,<br>
and 17, at least, below show certain methods of producing such mid-range abrasive<br>
products (and further exemplified within dentifrice formulations 2, 7, 9, and 10, below).<br><br><br>
For this mid-range cleaning material, the gel component is present in an amount<br>
between 10 and 60% by weight of the ultimately formed gel/precipitate silica composite<br>
material (and thus the precipitated silica component is present in an amount of from 90 to<br>
40% by weight as a result). Although the amount of gel possible to form a high cleaning<br>
material may be as high as 60% of the composite material, preferably such an amount is<br>
much lower mainly because it was found that the higher the amount of gel present within<br>
a mid-range cleaning material, the greater amount of low structure precipitated silica<br>
component required to be produced during the following phase. Thus, the overall amount<br>
of gel to be produced is preferably relatively low (from 20 to 33%, for instance). Such<br>
percentages of gel component actually represent the amount of silicate present during the<br>
production phases for each different silica material, as described above for the high<br>
cleaning material.<br>
Generally, it has been determined that such specific mid-range cleaning abrasives<br>
may be produced through a method of admixing a suitable acid and a suitable silicate<br>
starting material (wherein the acid concentration, in aqueous solution, is from 5 to 25 %,<br>
preferably from 10 to 20%, and more preferably from 10 to 12%, and the concentration<br>
of the silicate starting material is from 4 to 35%, also within an aqueous solution), to<br>
initially form a silica gel. Subsequent to gel formation, sufficient silicate and acid are<br>
added (without any appreciable degree of washing, or other type of purification, or<br>
physical modification of the gel) to the formed gel for further production of appropriately<br>
structured precipitated silica component desired for a mid-range cleaning composite<br>
material to be formed. The pH of the overall reaction may be controlled anywhere within<br>
the range of 3 to 10. Depending on the amount of gel initially formed, the amount and<br><br><br>
structure of precipitated silica component may be targeted in much the same way as for<br>
the high cleaning material. It has been realized that in order to provide a mid-range<br>
cleaning, low abrasive material through this process, as compared with the high cleaning<br>
materials noted above, the amount of gel is preferably higher (as noted above, from 10 to<br>
60% by volume of the composite, preferably from 20 to 33%) and the amount of low<br>
structure precipitated silica is preferably lower (from 90 to 40% by volume of the<br>
composite, preferably from 80 to 67%). In order to exhibit the proper PCR and RDA<br>
levels associated with this category, the resultant gel/silica composite material must<br>
exhibit a linseed oil absorption of greater than 100 up to 150 ml oil/100 g material.<br>
Broadly, the inventive mid-range cleaning gel/precipitated silica combination<br>
generally have the following properties: 10% Brass Einlehner hardness values in the<br>
range between 2.5 and 12.0, and, within a test dentifrice formulation (as presented below<br>
within the examples) RDA (Radioactive Dentin Abrasion) values between about 95 to<br>
about 150, and (within the same test dentifrice formulation) PCR (Pellicle Cleaning<br>
Ratio) values of 90 to 120, with a ratio of PCR to RDA within the range of 0.7 to 1.1.<br>
Thickening Cleaners/Abrasives<br>
Lastly, again, in much the manner as the two above types of abrasives, it has<br>
surprisingly been found that silica-based viscosity-modifying materials may be provided<br>
that also exhibit a certain degree of abrasiveness and cleaning through the utilization of<br>
the inventive in situ process. The presence of a simultaneously produced gel/precipitate<br>
appears to surprisingly accord a certain abrasive property within a material that, when<br>
produced via a high structure silica production method, provides an effective thickening<br><br><br>
(or other type of viscosity modification) within dentifrice formulations. In such a<br>
manner, such a thickening agent may be added not only for its viscosity-modifying effect,<br>
but also to supplement simultaneously present higher cleaning and/or abrasive dentifrice<br>
components. Examples 3, 8, 9, and 13, at least, provide a showing of general methods of<br>
producing such thickening abrasives (and further exemplified within dentifrice<br>
formulations 5, 6, and 8, below).<br>
For this low cleaning level material, the gel component is present in an amount<br>
between 20 and 85% by volume of the ultimately formed gel/precipitate silica composite<br>
material (and thus the precipitated silica component is present in an amount of from 80 to<br>
15% by volume as a result, with such a component preferably present in a high structure<br>
form). Although the amount of gel possible to form a high cleaning material may be as<br>
low as 20% of the composite material, preferably such an amount is much higher mainly<br>
because it was found that the lower the amount of gel present within a thickening<br>
abrasive material, the greater amount of high structure precipitated silica component<br>
required to be produced during the following phase. Thus, the overall amount of gel to<br>
be produced is preferably relatively high (from 45 to 65%, 50% more preferably, for<br>
instance). Such percentages of gel component actually represent the amount of silicate<br>
present during the production phases for each different silica material, as described above<br>
for the other categories of cleaning materials.<br>
Generally, it has been determined that such specific thickening abrasives may be<br>
produced through a method of admixing a suitable acid and a suitable silicate starting<br>
material (wherein the acid concentration, in aqueous solution, is from 5 to 25 %,<br>
preferably from 10 to 20%, and more preferably from 10 to 12%, and the concentration<br><br><br>
of the silicate starting material is from 4 to 35%, also within an aqueous solution), to<br>
initially form a silica gel. Subsequent to gel formation, sufficient silicate and acid are<br>
added (without any appreciable degree of washing, or other type of purification, or<br>
physical modification of the gel) to the formed gel for further production of high structure<br>
precipitated silica component desired for a thickening abrasive composite material to be<br>
formed. The pH of the overall reaction may be controlled anywhere within the range of 3<br>
to 10. Depending on the amount of gel initially formed, the amount and structure of<br>
precipitated silica component may be targeted by reacting the subsequent silicate and acid<br>
reactants within a more acidic medium to form greater amounts of high structure<br>
precipitated silica components. It has been realized that in order to provide a thickening<br>
abrasive material through this process, the amount of gel is preferably higher (as noted<br>
above, from 20 to 85% by volume of the composite, preferably from 45 to 65%) and the<br>
amount of low structure precipitated silica is preferably relatively low (as low as<br>
possible), while the amount of high structure precipitated silica is preferably relatively<br>
high (from 80 to 15% by volume of the composite, preferably from 55 to 35%). In order<br>
to exhibit the proper PCR and RDA levels associated with this category, the resultant<br>
gel/silica composite material must exhibit a linseed oil absorption of greater than 150,<br>
possibly with a maximum of about 225 ml oil/100 g material.<br>
Broadly, the inventive thickening abrasive gel/precipitated silica combination<br>
generally have the following properties: 10% Brass Einlehner hardness values in the<br>
range between 1.0 and 5.0 mg loss/100,000 revolutions, and, within a test dentifrice<br>
formulation (as presented below within the examples) RDA (Radioactive Dentin<br>
Abrasion) values between about 20 to about 80, and (within the same test dentifrice<br><br><br>
formulation) PCR (Pellicle Cleaning Ratio) values of about 50 to 80, with a ratio of PCR<br>
to RDA within the range of 0.8 to 3.5.<br>
Dentifrice Uses of the Inventive Materials<br>
The inventive in situ generated gel/precipitate silica composite materials<br>
described herein may be utilized alone as the cleaning agent component provided in the<br>
dentifrice compositions of this invention, although, at least for the high cleaning category<br>
materials, the moderately high RDA levels may be unacceptable to some consumers.<br>
Thus, a combination of the inventive composite materials with other abrasives physically<br>
blended therewith within a suitable dentifrice formulation is potentially preferred in this<br>
regard in order to accord targeted dental cleaning and abrasion results at a desired<br>
protective level. Thus, any number of other conventional types of abrasive additives may<br>
be present within inventive dentifrices in accordance with this invention. Other such<br>
abrasive particles include, for example, and without limitation, precipitated calcium<br>
carbonate (PCC), ground calcium carbonate (GCC), dicalcium phosphate or its dihydrate<br>
forms, silica gel (by itself, and of any structure), amorphous precipitated silica (by itself,<br>
and of any structure as well), perlite, titanium dioxide, calcium pyrophosphate, hydrated<br>
alumina, calcined alumina, insoluble sodium metaphosphate, insoluble potassium<br>
metaphosphate, insoluble magnesium carbonate, zirconium silicate, aluminum silicate,<br>
and so forth, can be introduced within the desired abrasive compositions to tailor the<br>
polishing characteristics of the target formulation (dentifrices, for example, etc.), if<br>
desired, as well.<br><br><br>
The precipitate/gel silica combination described above, when incorporated into<br>
dentifrice compositions, is present at a level of from about 5% to about 50% by weight,<br>
more preferably from about 10% to about 35% by weight, particularly when the<br>
dentifrice is a toothpaste. Overall dentifrice or oral cleaning formulations incorporating<br>
the abrasive compositions of this invention conveniently can comprise the following<br>
possible ingredients and relative amounts thereof (all amounts in wt %):<br><br>
In addition, as noted above, the inventive abrasive could be used in conjunction<br>
with other abrasive materials, such as precipitated silica, silica gel, dicalcium phosphate,<br>
dicalicum phosphate dihydrate, calcium metasilicate, calcium pyrophosphate, alumina,<br>
calcined alumina, aluminum silicate, precipitated and ground calcium carbonate, chalk,<br>
bentonite, particulate thermosetting resins and other suitable abrasive materials known to<br>
a person of ordinary skill in the art.<br><br>
In addition to the abrasive component, the dentifrice may also contain one or<br>
more organoleptic enhancing agents. Organoleptic enhancing agents include humectants,<br>
sweeteners, surfactants, flavorants, colorants and thickening agents, (also sometimes<br>
known as binders, gums, or stabilizing agents),<br>
Humectants serve to add body or "mouth texture" to a dentifrice as well as<br>
preventing the dentifrice from drying out. Suitable humectants include polyethylene<br>
glycol (at a variety of different molecular weights), propylene glycol, glycerin (glycerol),<br>
erythritol, xylitol, sorbitol, mannitol, lactitol, and hydrogenated starch hydrolyzates, as<br>
well as mixtures of these compounds. Typical levels of humectants are from about 20<br>
wt% to about 30 wt% of a toothpaste composition.<br>
Sweeteners may be added to the toothpaste composition to impart a pleasing taste<br>
to the product. Suitable sweeteners include saccharin (as sodium, potassium or calcium<br>
saccharin), cyclamate (as a sodium, potassium or calcium salt), acesulfane-K, thaumatin,<br>
neohisperidin dihydrochalcone, ammoniated glycyrrhizin, dextrose, levulose, sucrose,<br>
mannose, and glucose.<br>
Surfactants are used in the compositions of the present invention to make the<br>
compositions more cosmetically acceptable. The surfactant is preferably a detersive<br>
material which imparts to the composition detersive and foaming properties. Suitable<br>
surfactants are safe and effective amounts of anionic, cationic, nonionic, zwitterionic,<br>
amphoteric and betaine surfactants such as sodium lauryl sulfate, sodium dodecyl<br>
benzene sulfonate, alkali metal or ammonium salts of lauroyl sarcosinate, myristoyl<br>
sarcosinate, palmitoyl sarcosinate, stearoyl sarcosinate and oleoyl sarcosinate,,<br>
polyoxyethylene sorbitan monostearate, isostearate and laurate, sodium lauryl<br><br><br>
sulfoacetate, N-lauroyl sarcosine, the sodium, potassium, and ethanolamine salts of N-<br>
lauroyl, N-myristoyl, or N-palmitoyl sarcosine, polyethylene oxide condensates of alkyl<br>
phenols, cocoamidopropyl betaine, lauramidopropyl betaine, palmityl betaine and the<br>
like. Sodium lauryl sulfate is a preferred surfactant. The surfactant is typically present in<br>
the oral care compositions of the present invention in an amount of about 0.1 to about<br>
15% by weight, preferably about 0.3% to about 5% by weight, such as from about 0.3 %<br>
to about 2%, by weight.<br>
Flavoring agents optionally can be added to dentifrice compositions. Suitable<br>
flavoring agents include, but are not limited to, oil of wintergreen, oil of peppermint, oil<br>
of spearmint, oil of sassafras, and oil of clove, cinnamon, anethole, menthol, thymol,<br>
eugenol, eucalyptol, lemon, orange and other such flavor compounds to add fruit notes,<br>
spice notes, etc. These flavoring agents consist chemically of mixtures of aldehydes,<br>
ketones, esters, phenols, acids, and aliphatic, aromatic and other alcohols.<br>
Colorants may be added to improve the aesthetic appearance of the product.<br>
Suitable colorants are selected from colorants approved by appropriate regulatory bodies<br>
such as the FDA and those listed in the European Food and Pharmaceutical Directives<br>
and include pigments, such as TiO2, and colors such as FD&amp;C and D&amp;C dyes.<br>
Thickening agents are useful in the dentifrice compositions of the present<br>
invention to provide a gelatinous structure that stabilizes the toothpaste against phase<br>
separation. Suitable thickening agents include silica thickener; starch; glycerite of starch;<br>
gums such as gum karaya (sterculia gum), gum tragacanth, gum arabic, gum ghatti, gum<br>
acacia, xanthan gum, guar gum and cellulose gum; magnesium aluminum silicate<br>
(Veegum); carrageenan; sodium alginate; agar-agar; pectin; gelatin; cellulose compounds<br><br><br>
such as cellulose, carboxymethyl cellulose, hydroxyethyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl<br>
cellulose, hydroxymethyl cellulose, hydroxymethyl carboxypropyl cellulose, methyl<br>
cellulose, ethyl cellulose, and sulfated cellulose; natural and synthetic clays such as<br>
hectorite clays; as well as mixtures of these compounds. Typical levels of thickening<br>
agents or binders are from about 0 wt% to about 15 wt% of a toothpaste composition.<br>
Therapeutic agents are optionally used in the compositions of the present<br>
invention to provide for the prevention and treatment of dental caries, periodontal disease<br>
and temperature sensitivity. Examples of therapeutic agents, without intending to be<br>
limiting, are fluoride sources, such as sodium fluoride, sodium monofluorophosphate,<br>
potassium monofluorophosphate, stannous fluoride, potassium fluoride, sodium<br>
fluorosilicate, ammonium fluorosilicate and the like; condensed phosphates such as<br>
tetrasodium pyrophosphate, tetrapotassium pyrophosphate, disodium dihydrogen<br>
pyrophosphate, trisodium monohydrogen pyrophosphate; tripolyphosphates,<br>
hexametaphosphates, trimetaphosphates and pyrophosphates, such as ; antimicrobial<br>
agents such as triclosan, bisguanides, such as alexidine, chlorhexidine and chlorhexidine<br>
gluconate; enzymes such as papain, bromelain, glucoamylase, amylase, dextranase,<br>
mutanase, lipases, pectinase, tannase, and proteases; quartemary ammonium compounds,<br>
such as benzalkonium chloride (BZK), benzethonium chloride (BZT), cetylpyridinium<br>
chloride (CPC), and domiphen bromide; metal salts, such as zinc citrate, zinc chloride,<br>
and stannous fluoride; sanguinaria extract and sanguinarine; volatile oils, such as<br>
eucalyptol, menthol, thymol, and methyl salicylate; amine fluorides; peroxides and the<br>
like. Therapeutic agents may be used in dentifrice formulations singly or in combination<br>
at a therapeutically safe and effective level.<br><br><br>
Preservatives may also be optionally added to the compositions of the present<br>
invention to prevent bacterial growth. Suitable preservatives approved for use in oral<br>
compositions such as methylparaben, propylparaben and sodium benzoate may be added<br>
in safe and effective amounts.<br>
The dentifrices disclosed herein may also a variety of additional ingredients such<br>
as desensitizing agents, healing agents, other caries preventative agents,<br>
chelating/sequestering agents, vitamins, amino acids, proteins, other anti-plaque/anti-<br>
calculus agents, opacifiers, antibiotics, anti-enzymes, enzymes, pH control agents,<br>
oxidizing agents, antioxidants, and the like<br>
Water provides the balance of the composition in addition to the additives<br>
mentioned. The water is preferably deionized and free of impurities. The dentifrice will<br>
usually comprise from about 20 wt% to about 35 wt% of water.<br>
Useful silica thickeners for utilization within such a toothpaste formulation<br>
include, as a non-limiting example, an amorphous precipitated silica such as<br>
ZEODENTÂ® 165 silica. Other preferred (though non-limiting) silica thickeners are<br>
ZEODENTÂ® 163 and/or 167 and ZEOFREEÂ®153, 177, and/or 265 silicas, all available<br>
from J. M. Huber Corporation, Havre de Grace Md., U.S.A.<br>
For purposes of this invention, a "dentifrice" has the meaning defined in Oral<br>
Hygiene Products and Practice, Morton Pader, Consumer Science and Technology Series,<br>
Vol. 6, Marcel Dekker, NY 1988, p. 200, which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Namely, a "dentifrice" is "... a substance used with a toothbrush to clean the accessible<br>
surfaces of the teeth. Dentifrices are primarily composed of water, detergent, humectant,<br>
binder, flavoring agents, and a finely powdered abrasive as the principal ingredient... a<br><br><br>
dentifrice is considered to be an abrasive-containing dosage form for delivering anti-<br>
caries agents to the teeth." Dentifrice formulations contain ingredients which must be<br>
dissolved prior to incorporation into the dentifrice formulation (e.g. anti-caries agents<br>
such as sodium fluoride, sodium phosphates, flavoring agents such as saccharin).<br>
The various silica and toothpaste (dentifrice) properties described herein were<br>
measured as follows, unless indicated otherwise.<br>
The Brass Einlehner (BE) Abrasion test used to measure the hardness of the<br>
precipitated silicas/silica gels reported in this application is described in detail in U.S.<br>
Pat. No. 6,616,916, incorporated herein by reference, involves an Einlehner AT-1000<br>
Abrader generally used as follows: (1) a Fourdrinier brass wire screen is weighed and<br>
exposed to the action of a 10% aqueous silica suspension for a fixed length of time; (2)<br>
the amount of abrasion is then determined as milligrams brass lost from the Fourdrinier<br>
wire screen per 100,000 revolutions. The result, measured in units of mg loss, can be<br>
characterized as the 10% brass Einlehner (BE) abrasion value.<br>
The oil absorption values are measured using the rubout method. This method is<br>
based on a principle of mixing linseed oil with a silica by rubbing with a spatula on a<br>
smooth surface until a stiff putty-like paste is formed. By measuring the quantity of oil<br>
required to have a paste mixture which will curl when spread out, one can calculate the<br>
oil absorption value of the silicaâthe value which represents the volume of oil required<br>
per unit weight of silica to saturate the silica sorptive capacity. A higher oil absorption<br>
level indicates a higher structure of precipitated silica; similarly, a low value is indicative<br>
of what is considered a low-structure precipitated silica. Calculation of the oil absorption<br>
value was done as follows:<br><br><br><br>
As a first step in measuring refractive index ("RI") and degree of light<br>
transmission, a range of glycerin/water stock solutions (about 10) was prepared so that<br>
the refractive index of these solutions lies between 1.428 and 1.46. The exact<br>
glycerin/water ratios needed depend on the exact glycerin used and is determined by the<br>
technician making the measurement. Typically, these stock solutions will cover the range<br>
of 70 wt% to 90 wt% glycerin in water. To determine Refractive index, one or two drops<br>
of each standard solution is separately placed on the fixed plate of a refractometer (Abbe<br>
60 Refractometer Model 10450). The covering plate is fixed and locked into place. The<br>
light source and refractometer are switched on and the refractive index of each standard<br>
solution is read.<br>
Into separate 20-ml bottles, accurately weighed was 2.0 +/- 0.01 ml of the<br>
inventive gel/precipitate silica product and added was 18.0 +/- 0.01 ml of each respective<br>
stock glycerin/water solution (for products with measured oil absorption above 150, the<br>
test used 1 g of inventive gel/precipitate silica product and 19 g of the stock<br>
glycerin/water solution). The bottles were then shaken vigorously to form silica<br>
dispersion, the stoppers were removed from the bottles, and the bottles were placed in a<br>
desiccator, which was then evacuated with a vacuum pump (about 24 inches Hg).<br><br>
The dispersions were then de-aerated for 120 minutes and visually inspected for<br>
complete de-aeration. The %Transmittance ("%T") at 590 nm (Spectronic 20 D+) was<br>
measured after the samples returned to room temperature (about 10 minutes), according<br>
to the manufacturer's operating instructions.<br>
The %Transmittance was measured on the inventive product/glycerin/water<br>
dispersions by placing an aliquot of each dispersion in a quartz cuvette and reading the<br>
%T at 590 nm wavelength for each sample on a 0-100 scale. The %Transmittance vs. RI<br>
of the stock solutions used was plotted on a curve. The Refractive index of the inventive<br>
product was defined as the position of the plotted peak maximum (the ordinate or X-<br>
value) on the %Transmittance vs. the RI curve. The Y-value (or abscissa) of the peak<br>
maximum was the %Transmittance.<br>
The surface area of the precipitated silica/silica gel reported herein is determined<br>
by the BET nitrogen adsorption method of Brunaur et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc, 60, 309<br>
(1938).<br>
The total pore volume (Hg) is measured by mercury porosimetry using a<br>
Micromeritics Autopore II 9220 apparatus. The pore diameters can be calculated by the<br>
Washburn equation employing a contact angle Theta (G) equal to 140Â° and a surface<br>
tension gamma equal to 485 dynes/cm. This instrument measures the void volume and<br>
pore size distribution of various materials. Mercury is forced into the voids as a function<br>
of pressure and the volume of the mercury intruded per gram of sample is calculated at<br>
each pressure setting. Total pore volume expressed herein represents the cumulative<br>
volume of mercury intruded at pressures from vacuum to 60,000 psi. Increments in<br>
volume (cm3/g) at each pressure setting are plotted against the pore radius or diameter<br><br><br>
corresponding to the pressure setting increments. The peak in the intruded volume versus<br>
pore radius or diameter curve corresponds to the mode in the pore size distribution and<br>
identifies the most common pore size in the sample. Specifically, sample size is adjusted<br>
to achieve a stem volume of 25-75% in a powder penetrometer with a 5 ml bulb and a<br>
stem volume of about 1.1 ml. Samples are evacuated to a pressure of 50 Âµm of Hg and<br>
held for 5 minutes. Mercury fills the pores from 1.5 to 60,000 psi with a 10 second<br>
equilibrium time at each of approximately 103 data collection points.<br>
Median particle size is determined using a Model LA-930 (or LA-300 or an<br>
equivalent) laser light scattering instrument available from Horiba Instruments,<br>
Boothwyn, Pennsylvania.<br>
Two criteria for describing the tightness of the particle size distribution are particle<br>
size span ratio and beta values as measured using a Horiba laser light scattering<br>
instrument. By "particle size span ratio" it is meant the cumulative diameter of the<br>
particles in the tenth percentile (D10) minus the cumulative volume at the ninetieth<br>
volume percentile (D90) divided by the diameter of the particles in the fiftieth volume<br>
percentile (D50), i.e. (D10-D90)/D50. A lower span ratio indicates a narrower particle<br>
size distribution. By "particle size beta value" it is meant cumulative diameter of the<br>
particles in the twenty-fifth volume percentile (D25) divided by the diameter of the<br>
particles in the seventy-fifth volume percentile (D75), i.e. D25/D75. A higher beta value<br>
indicates a narrower particle size distribution.<br>
CTAB external surface area of silica is determined by absorption of CTAB<br>
(cetyltrimethylammonium bromide) on the silica surface, the excess separated by<br>
centrifugation and determined by titration with sodium lauryl sulfate using a surfactant<br><br><br>
electrode. The external surface of the silica is determined from the quantity of CTAB<br>
adsorbed (analysis of CTAB before and after adsorption). Specifically, about 0.5 g of<br>
silica is placed in a 250-ml beaker with 100.00 ml CTAB solution (5.5 g/L), mixed on an<br>
electric stir plate for 1 hour, then centrifuged for 30 minutes at 10,000 rpm. One ml of<br>
10% Triton X-100 is added to 5 ml of the clear supernatant in a 100-ml beaker. The pH is<br>
adjusted to 3.0-3.5 with 0.1 N HCI and the specimen is titrated with 0.0100 M sodium<br>
lauryl sulfate using a surfactant electrode (Brinkmann SUR1501-DL) to determine the<br>
endpoint.<br>
The % 325 mesh residue of the inventive silica is measured utilizing a U.S.<br>
Standard Sieve No. 325, with 44 micron or 0.0017 inch openings (stainless steel wire<br>
cloth) by weighing a 10.0 gram sample to the nearest 0.1 gram into the cup of the 1 quart<br>
Hamilton mixer Model No. 30, adding approximately 170 ml of distilled or deionized<br>
water and stirring the slurry for at least 7 min. Transfer the mixture onto the 325 mesh<br>
screen; wash out the cup and add washings onto the screen. Adjust water spray to 20 psi<br>
and spray directly on screen for two minutes. (Spray head should be held about four to<br>
six inches above the screen cloth. Wash the residue to one side of the screen and transfer<br>
by washing into an evaporating dish using distilled or deionized water from a washing<br>
bottle. Let stand for two to three minutes and decant the clear water. Dry (convection<br>
oven @ 150Â°C or under infrared oven for approx. 15 min.) cool and weigh residue on<br>
analytical balance.<br>
Moisture or Loss on Drying (LOD) is the measured silica sample weight loss at<br>
105Â°C for 2 hours. Loss on ignition (LOI) is the measured silica sample weight loss at<br>
900Â°C for 2 hours (sample previously predried for 2 hours at 105Â°C).<br><br><br>
The pH values of the reaction mixtures (5 weight % slurry) encountered in the<br>
present invention can be monitored by any conventional pH sensitive electrode.<br>
Sodium sulfate content was measured by conductivity of a known concentration<br>
of silica slurry. Specifically, 38g silica wetcake sample was weighed into a one-quart<br>
mixer cup of a Hamilton Beach Mixer, model Number 30, and 140 ml of deionized water<br>
was added. The slurry was mixed for 5 to 7 minutes, then the slurry was transferred to a<br>
250-ml graduated cylinder and the cylinder filled to the 250-ml mark with deionized<br>
water, using the water to rinse out the mixer cup. The sample was mixed by inverting the<br>
graduated cylinder (covered) several times. A conductivity meter, such as a Cole Palmer<br>
CON 500 Model #19950-00, was used to determine the conductivity of the slurry.<br>
Sodium sulfate content was determined by comparison of the sample conductivity with a<br>
standard curve generated from known method-of-addition sodium sulfate/silica<br>
composition slurries.<br>
Further tests followed below were utilized to analyze the structure of initially<br>
produced silica gel during the overall in situ gel/precipitate production method. Included<br>
within these analyses was porosity. Such a property of accessible porosity was obtained<br>
using nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherm measurements. The BJH (Barrett-Joiner-<br>
Halender) model average pore diameter was determined based on the desorption branch<br>
utilizing an Accelerated Surface Area and Porosimetry System (ASAP 2010) available<br>
form Micromeritics Instrument Corporation, Norcross, Georgia. Samples were out-<br>
gassed at 150-200Â°C until the vacuum pressure was about 5 Âµm of Mercury. Such an<br>
analyzer was an automatic volumetric type at 77 K. Pore volume was obtained at a<br>
pressure P/Po=0.99. Average pore diameter is derived from pore volume and surface area<br><br><br>
assuming cylindrical pores. Pore size distribution (AV/AD) was calculated using the BJH<br>
method, which provides the pore volume within a range of pore diameters. A Halsey<br>
thickness curve type was used with pore size range of 1.7 to 300.0 nm diameter, with<br>
zero fraction of pores open at both ends.<br>
The toothpaste (dentifrice) viscosity is measured utilizing a Brookfield<br>
Viscometer Model RVT equipped with a Helipath T-F spindle and set to 5 rpm by<br>
measuring the viscosity of the toothpaste at 25Â°C at three different levels as the spindle<br>
descends through the toothpaste test sample and averaging the results. Brookfield<br>
viscosity is expressed in centipoise (cP).<br>
The Radioactive Dentin Abrasion (RDA) values of dentifrices containing the<br>
silica compositions used in this invention are determined according to the method set<br>
forth by Hefferen, Journal of Dental Res., July-August 1976, 55 (4), pp. 563-573, and<br>
described in Wason U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,340,583, 4,420,312 and 4,421,527, which<br>
publications and patents are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
The cleaning property of dentifrice compositions is typically expressed in terms<br>
of Pellicle Cleaning Ratio ("PCR") value. The PCR test measures the ability of a<br>
dentifrice composition to remove pellicle film from a tooth under fixed brushing<br>
conditions. The PCR test is described in "In Vitro Removal of Stain With Dentifrice" G.<br>
K. Stookey, et al., J. Dental Res., 61, 1236-9, 1982. Both PCR and RDA results vary<br>
depending upon the nature and concentration of the components of the dentifrice<br>
composition. PCR and RDA values are unitless.<br><br><br>
Preferred Embodiments of the Invention<br>
The inventive materials were prepared by sequentially forming (in situ) a first<br>
silica gel (or gel-like material) and adding thereto sufficient amounts of reactants to form<br>
a precipitated silica component present simultaneously with the initially produced gel (or<br>
gel-like material). The amount of gel is controlled by the quantity of reactants in the first<br>
stage while the amount of precipitated silica is controlled by the quantity of reactants in<br>
the second stage. The structure of the final product is controlled by the amount of gel<br>
first produced as related to the amount of precipitated silica, as well as reaction<br>
parameters, such as temperature, rates, concentrations, pH, and so forth, as discussed in<br>
greater detail above.<br>
Initial Gel Formation<br>
EXAMPLE 1-2<br>
The first two examples show the initial production of silica gel within the overall<br>
gel/precipitate production method. After initial production, some of these samples were<br>
then washed and purified in order to analyze the resultant material to determine if an<br>
actual gel is first formed as well as for other gel properties exhibited by such a sample. It<br>
is important to note that the remainder of the samples was utilized in the further<br>
production of gel/precipitate products below without any washing, purifying, etc.<br>
In each example, a volume of aqueous solution of 3.3 mole ratio sodium silicate<br>
of specified concentration was charged within a 30 gallon reactor and agitated therein at<br>
60 rpm. The reactor contents were then heated to 50Â°C and then 11.4% sulfuric acid<br>
(heated to 30Â°C) was added at a specified rate and for a specified time and the resultant<br><br><br>
product was then allowed to form into a gel-like material. This material was then filtered<br>
and subsequently washed with water (at about 60Â°C) and spray-dried. Such collected and<br>
dried material was then tested for a number of properties as noted below, the tests for<br>
which were delineated above. The following Table 1 includes reaction parameters and<br>
conditions; Table 2 provides analyzed properties for these initially produced gel products.<br>
It was evident that, upon analysis, a silica gel material was initially formed. Again, the<br>
filtering and washing steps performed after collection thereof were only necessary to<br>
further analyze the formed gel for certain properties in accordance with Table 2, below.<br>
Such analysis is not generally performed during the actual inventive in situ production of<br>
the target gel/precipitate silica combination. It was merely an interest to determine if a<br>
silica gel had been produced initially and the properties thereof for classification<br>
purposes. Furthermore, for this table as well as throughout this disclosure, any data that<br>
was unavailable or unmeasured is represented by dashes. Additionally, it is important to<br>
note that the oil absorption properties measured for the silica gel alone is not an<br>
indication of nor is it to be confused with the determination of oil absorption for the<br>
entire inventive gel/precipitate silica combination.<br><br><br><br><br>
In Situ Gel/Precipitate Composite Production<br>
EXAMPLES 3-7<br>
Examples 3-7 contained from about 10 to about 23% by volume gel and thus from<br>
about 90% to about 77% by volume precipitated silica (as noted in the accompanying<br>
tables). The products of these examples had silica structure levels varying from low<br>
structure (LS) to medium structure (MS) to high structure (HS).<br>
A first step was followed in which a volume of aqueous solution of sodium<br>
silicate (Silicate Volume A) of specified concentration (Silicate Concentration A) and a<br>
SiO2:Na2O ratio of 3.3 was charged within a reactor and agitated therein (depending upon<br>
the size of the reactor, the agitation speed was from about 60 to about 92 rpm, although<br>
any speed may be utilized for such a procedure). The reactor contents were heated to<br>
50Â°C and then 11.4% sulfuric acid was added at a specified rate (Acid Rate A) for a<br>
specified time (Acid Addition Time A). (For Example 5, for instance, the agitator speed<br>
was set to 60 rpm, except it was increased briefly for 1 minute to 120 RPM during Acid<br>
Addition Time 4 -5 minutes.) At this point, a specified Water Volume, if indicated, was<br>
added to the formed silica gel. A silica gel was then visually recognized and the pH of the<br>
slurry was tested and optionally maintained at pH 5.0, as indicated, by adjusting the acid<br>
addition rate. The resultant slurry was then heated to as high as 93 Â°C (with others heated<br>
to lower temperatures, as low as 80Â°C, but allowed to continue to heat up to 93 Â°C after<br>
the second stage precipitation was started), and such a temperature was then maintained<br>
for the duration of the batch production. Subsequently, simultaneous addition began of a<br>
second amount of an aqueous solution of sodium silicate pre-heated to 85Â°C at specified<br>
concentration (Silicate Concentration B) at a specified rate (Silicate Rate B) and the same<br><br><br>
sulfuric acid at a specified rate (Acid Rate B). Recirculation of the reactor contents at a<br>
rate of 75 LPM began after simultaneous addition of acid and silicate commenced and<br>
continued through digestion. After a specified time (Silicate Addition Time B) of<br>
sodium silicate introduction, its flow was stopped. The pH of the reactor contents was<br>
continuously monitored during the simultaneous addition stage. The acid addition<br>
continued until the entire batch pH dropped to about 7.0. Once this pH was attained, the<br>
acid flow was slowed to about 2.7 liters per minute and continued at such a rate until the<br>
overall pH of the resultant batch was dropped to 4.6. The finished batch was then heated<br>
at 93Â°C for 10 minutes (digestion), while maintaining the batch pH at 4.6. The resultant<br>
slurry was then recovered by filtration, washed to a sodium sulfate concentration of less<br>
than about 5% (preferably less than 4%, and most preferably below 2%) as determined by<br>
monitoring the filtrate conductivity and then spray dried to a level of about 5% water<br>
utilizing an inlet temperature of ~480Â°C. The dried product was then milled to uniform<br>
size. Parameters used for Examples 3-7 are described in Table 3. The Acid rate levels for<br>
some of the examples were adjusted during the reaction, as noted below.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
EXAMPLES 8-12<br>
Examples 8-12 contained about 25-35% by volume gel and about 75-65 % by<br>
volume precipitated silica. The products of these examples had silica structure levels<br>
varying from very low structure to high structure. These examples were prepared<br>
according to the procedure given in Example 3-7, except with the parameters described in<br>
Table 5 below (note that Example 12 was produced within a very large reactor, about<br>
40,000 liters in volume, with an agitation speed of about 92 rpm and a high shear<br>
recirculation flow rate of about 3050 liters/minute).<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
Dentifrice Formulations<br>
Toothpaste formulations were prepared using several of the above-described<br>
gel/precipitated silica examples to demonstrate the ready-to-use on demand capabilities<br>
of the inventive compositions without furthering metering of the two components for<br>
optimum dental protection benefits.<br><br>
To prepare the dentifrices, the glycerin, sodium carboxymethyl cellulose,<br>
polyethylene glycol and sorbitol were mixed together and stirred until the ingredients<br>
were dissolved to form a first admixture. The deionized water, sodium fluoride,<br>
tetrasodium pyrophosphate and sodium saccharin were also mixed together and stirred<br>
until these ingredients are dissolved to form a second admixture. These two admixtures<br>
were then combined with stirring. Thereafter, the optional color was added with stirring<br>
to obtain a "pre-mix". The pre-mix was placed in a Ross mixer (Model 130 LDM) and<br>
silica thickener, abrasive silica and titanium dioxide were mixed in without vacuum. A<br>
30-inch vacuum was drawn and the resultant admixture was stirred for approximately 15<br>
minutes. Lastly, sodium lauryl sulfate and flavor were added and the admixture was<br>
stirred for approximately 5 minutes at a reduced mixing speed. The resultant dentifrice<br>
was transferred to plastic laminate toothpaste tubes and stored for future testing. The<br>
dentifrice formulations are given in Table 11 below. The dentifrice formulation utilized<br>
was considered a suitable test dentifrice formulation for the purposes of determining PCR<br>
and RDA (as well as viscosity) measurements for the inventive and comparative cleaning<br>
abrasives. Changes in the amount of carboxymethyl cellulose to permit proper formation<br>
of the dentifrice from physical and aesthetic perspectives were made in certain situations<br>
with an offset in the amount of deionized water added, but the overall base dentifrice<br>
formulation remained essentially static for the tests followed as noted above.<br><br><br><br>

CT<br>
2	A carboxymethylcellulose available from the Aqualon division of Hercules<br>
Corporation, Wilmington, DE; also acceptable is CEKOLÂ® 2000, a CMC available from<br>
Noviant<br>
The dentifrice formulations prepared above were evaluated for PCR and RDA<br>
properties, according to the methods described above; the measurements, as well as the<br>
PCR:RDA ratios for each dentifrice formulation are provided in Table 12 below. The<br>
PCR data for Formulations 1,3, and 8 were obtained from Southeastern Dental Research<br>
Corporation of Port Allen, Lousiana, and the remaining PCR data from Oral Health<br>
Research Institute of Indianapolis, Indiana.<br><br>
The results show varied performance with highly effective cleaning capabilities<br>
with relatively low dentin abrasion properties.<br>
Several other dentifrice formulations were prepared using a combination of 2<br>
inventive silicas for Formulations 12-14 and a combination of an inventive silica and a<br>
commercial silica (ZEODENTÂ® 115 from J.M. Huber Corporation) for Formulation 11.<br>
The dentifrice formulations were prepared according to the method provided above and<br><br>
with much the same ingredients as described above in Table 11. The following Table 13<br>
provides the formulas for these toothpastes incorporating blends of different silica<br>
abrasives in relation to the invention described herein.<br><br><br>
The dentifrice formulations prepared above were evaluated for PCR and RDA<br>
properties, according to the methods described above; the measurements, as well as the<br>
PCRrRDA ratios for each dentifrice formulation are provided in Table 14 below.<br><br>
The cleaning ability of these combinations, in particular Formulas 12, 13, and 14,<br>
evince a highly surprising and effective dental polishing and film removal material with<br>
much lower abrasion levels.<br>
Detailed Description of the Drawings<br>
FIG. 1 shows in graphical representation the ratios of RDA and PCR available<br>
within some of the dentifrice formulations listed above, as compared with physical<br>
mixtures of silica gel and precipitated silica, produced in much the same way as those<br>
disclosed within U.S. Pat. No. 5,658,553 to Rice. The slope of each line indicates the<br>
general results accorded by each different formulation and shows that the simultaneously<br>
formed combination of this invention imparts greater PCR results with correlated lower<br>
RDA. Thus, it has been unexpectedly found that such an inventive combination permits<br>
greater cleaning ability without simultaneously unacceptably high dentin abrasion.<br><br>
All dentifrices exhibited acceptable viscosity, fluoride availability, and excellent<br>
aesthetics (stand-up, texture, dispersion). Particularly, in view of the graphical<br>
representation within FIG. 1, it is evident that the comparative physical blends of such<br>
materials do not exhibit the same desired increase in pellicle film cleaning efficiency with<br>
lower RDA values as those of the in situ generated invention combinations.<br>
Likewise, in FIG. 2 there is provided a comparison of the thickening capabilities<br>
of the inventive in situ silica combinations versus those physical blends of gels and<br>
precipitates described within the Rice patent (within the same test dentifrice formulation<br>
as listed above). It is evident that there is a significant difference in overall structure and<br>
resultant function of these different types of materials as the in situ generated composite<br>
materials exhibit differing degrees of thickening over the spectrum of amounts of<br>
gel/precipitate present therein than the Rice patent blends. Clearly, then, there is a<br>
distinction in form and characteristics for these two different types of dentifrice additives.<br>
Furthermore, FIG. 3 shows in graphical representation the measurements of the<br>
PCR vs. RDA readings for the inventive gel/precipitate composite materials over a wide<br>
range as compared with the same measurements for the conventional precipitated silica<br>
abrasives (again as measured within the same test dentifrice formulation as presented<br>
above). It is evident from this representation that the inventive gel/precipitate silica<br>
composite materials accord much higher PCR results with correlative lower RDA<br>
properties than the conventional abrasive materials, showing the significant differences<br>
between the comparative abrasives and the inventive in situ produced types. In this<br>
manner, surprisingly, it has been realized that the in situ production of blends of silica<br>
gels and precipitated silica materials provides improved pellicle film cleaning benefits<br><br><br>
while simultaneously exhibiting much lower dentin abrasion readings, thereby providing<br>
a more effective cleaning material with a lower propensity to deleteriously abrade tooth<br>
surfaces during use.<br>
While the invention will be described and disclosed in connection with certain<br>
preferred embodiments and practices, it is in no way intended to limit the invention to<br>
those specific embodiments, rather it is intended to cover equivalent structures structural<br>

other than said composite.<br>
18.	The dentifrice formulation as claimed in claim 16 comprising an abrasive material<br>
other than said composite.<br>
19.	A method of producing the composite as as claimed in claim 13, said method<br>
comprising the sequential steps of:<br><br>
a)	admixing a sufficient amount of an alkali silicate having a concentration of<br>
from 4 to 35%) within an aqueous solution thereof and an acidulating agent having an acid<br>
concentration within an aqueous solution from 5 to 25% together at a temperature from 40 to<br>
90Â°C and under agitation to form a silica gel composition; and, without first washing,<br>
modifying, or purifying said formed silica gel composition,<br>
b)	subsequently introducing to said silica gel composition a sufficient amount of<br>
an alkali silicate and an acidulating agent to form a precipitated silica without affecting the<br>
silica gel, thereby producing a gel/precipitate silica composite, wherein the pH of the overall<br>
reaction is within the range of from 3 to 10.<br>
20.	The method as claimed in claim 19 wherein the acid concentration in step "a" is from<br>
10 to 20%.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
An in situ produced gel/precipitate silica composite and method of producing the<br>
same are disclosed. The in situ produced gel/precipitate silica composite comprises from 10<br>
to 60% by volume of silica gel, wherein said composite exhibits a linseed oil absorption of<br>
greater than 100 up to 150 ml/100g, and wherein said composite exhibits a 10% Brass<br>
Einlehner hardness value in the range between 2.5 and 12 mg loss/100,000 revolutions.<br>
The method involves the steps of: (a) admixing a sufficient amount of an alkali<br>
silicate having a concentration of from 4 to 35% within an aqueous solution thereof and an<br>
acidulating agent having an acid concentration within an aqueous solution from 5 to 25%<br>
together at a temperature from 40 to 90Â°C and under agitation to form a silica gel<br>
composition; and, without first washing, modifying, or purifying said formed silica gel<br>
composition, (b) subsequently introducing to said silica gel composition a sufficient amount<br>
of an alkali silicate and an acidulating agent to form a precipitated silica without affecting the<br>
silica gel, thereby producing a gel/precipitate silica composite, wherein the pH of the overall<br>
reaction is within the range of from 3 to 10.<br></td>
