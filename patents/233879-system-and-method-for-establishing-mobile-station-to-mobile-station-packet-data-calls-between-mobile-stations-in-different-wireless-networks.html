				<td>SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR ESTABLISHING MOBILE STATION-<br>
TO-MOBILE STATION PACKET DATA CALLS BETWEEN MOBILE<br>
STATIONS IN DIFFERENT WIRELESS NETWORKS<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to wireless communication systems and,<br>
more specifically, to a system and a related method for making packet data calls<br>
between mobile stations in a wireless network.<br>
Description of the Related Art<br>
Wireless communication systems have become ubiquitous in society.<br>
Business and consumers use a wide variety of fixed and mobile wireless<br>
terminals, including cell phones, pagers, Personal Communication Services<br>
(PCS) systems, and fixed wireless access devices (i.e., vending machine with<br>
cellular capability). Wireless service providers continually try to create new<br>
markets for wireless devices and expand existing markets by making wireless<br>
devices and services cheaper and more reliable. The price of wireless devices<br>
has decreased to the point where these devices are affordable to nearly everyone<br>
and the price of a wireless device is only a small part of the total cost to the user<br>
(i.e., subscriber). To continue to attract new customers, wireless service<br>
providers are implementing new services, especially digital data services that,<br>
for example, enable a user to browse the Internet and to send and receive e-mail.<br>
Subscribers have shown great interest in using high-speed applications<br>
between mobile stations in wireless networks. Many of these high-speed<br>
applications (e.g., video phones) require a radio access network (RAN) that<br>
supports streaming data applications. A streaming data application must be<br>
transported over constant bandwidth with low delay and low levels of jitter.<br>
However, current wireless networks, such as cdma2000 RANs, often experience<br>
problems when supporting streaming data applications. Packet data<br>
transmissions between a base station (BS) and a mobile station (MS) experience<br>
delay and jitter at numerous points in the network, including at the air interface<br>
between the MS and the BS and at the interface between the BS and the packet<br>
data serving node (PDSN).<br>
Delays and jitter would be minimized if streaming data could be<br>
transmitted more directly between mobile stations, without passing through<br>
some infrastructure of the radio access network (RAN), such as the PDSN.<br>
However, the well-known RAN signaling messages specified in TIA-2001-C,<br>
"Interoperability Specification For Cdma2000 Access Network Interfaces", June<br>
2003, (hereafter, simply "the TIA-2001-C standard") and other standards do not<br>
provide for direct mobile station-to-mobile station (MS-MS) packet data calls.<br>
The TIA-2001-C standard only allows for mobile originated packet data calls.<br>
Mobile calls that terminate at a mobile station are not possible under current<br>
standards.<br>
United States Patent Application Serial No. 20020077096 to Jin<br>
(hereafter, the "Jin application") discloses a method for providing mobile<br>
station-to-mobile station (MS-MS) data calls, provided the same base station<br>
(BS) serves both mobile stations. The method disclosed in the Jin application<br>
establishes MS-MS packet data calls without requiring connections between the<br>
BS and the PDSN. However, as noted, the mobile stations must be located in<br>
cells served by a single base station. This may be acceptable in a small wireless<br>
network that uses a single base station (e.g., a home or small office network).<br>
However, if a wireless network operator deploys a RAN with many base stations,<br>
this is a severe limitation. Subscribers who are distant from each other are served<br>
by different base stations and cannot engage in a MS-to-MS streaming data<br>
application without going through the PDSN and a wide area packet data<br>
network.<br>
The shortcomings of the Jin application are partially overcome by the<br>
apparatuses and methods disclosed in: 1) United States Patent Application Serial<br>
No. [Client No. SAMS01-00296], entitled "System And Method For Performing<br>
Handoffs Of Mobile Station-To-Mobile Station Packet Data Calls In A Wireless<br>
Network," filed on October 28, 2003, and 2) United States Patent Application Serial No.<br>
10/695, 595, entitled "System And Method For Establishing Mobile Station-To-Mobile<br>
Station Packet Data Calls Directly Between Base Stations Of A Wireless Network," filed<br>
on October 28, 2003. Application Serial Nos. 10/695, 595 and 10/695, 232 disclose<br>
wireless network infrastructure and mobile stations that are capable of establishing and<br>
handling off MS-MS packet data calls for two mobile stations that are served by<br>
different base stations, provided that both base stations are served by the same mobile<br>
switching center (MSC). Compared to the Jin application, the systems and methods<br>
disclosed in Application Serial Nos. 10/695, 595 and 10/695, 232 greatly increase the<br>
geographical area in which direct MS-MS packet data calls may be established.<br>
Nonetheless, the systems and methods in Application Serial Nos. 10/695, 595 and<br>
10/695, 232 are not capable of establishing MS-MS packet data calls between an<br>
originating mobile station operating in a first wireless networks (i.e., operating from a<br>
first mobile switching center) and a terminating mobile station operating in a second<br>
wireless networks (i.e., operating from a second mobile switching center).<br>
Therefore, there is a need for apparatuses and method that provide an MS-MS<br>
packet data connection across different wireless networks. In particular, there is a<br>
need for apparatuses and methods that establish an MS-MS packet data connection<br>
from an originating base station operating via a first mobile switch center (MSC) to a<br>
terminating base station operating via a first mobile switch center (MSC).<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>

In one embodiment of the present invention, the method further<br>
comprises the step of transmitting a second reply message from the server to the<br>
terminating MS via the second packet data bearer connection, the second reply<br>
message containing the mobile IP address of the originating MS.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, wherein the originating<br>
MS and the terminating MS use the mobile IP addresses received from the server<br>
to establish the packet data session between the originating MS and the<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
FIGURES 1 through 3, discussed below, and the various embodiments<br>
used to describe the principles of the present invention in this patent document<br>
are by way of illustration only and should not be construed in any way to limit<br>
the scope of the invention. Those skilled in the art will understand that the<br>
principles of the present invention may be implemented in any suitably arranged<br>
wireless communication network.<br>
FIGURE 1 illustrates exemplary wireless network 100, which can be<br>
used in a telecommunication system that establishes an MS-MS packet data<br>
connection between mobile stations served by different mobile switching centers<br>
according to the principles of the present invention. The telecommunication<br>
system would require two wireless networks similar to wireless network 100, as<br>
explained in detail in FIGURE 2 below. Wireless network 100 comprises a<br>
plurality of cell sites 121-123, each containing one of the base stations, BS 101,<br>
BS 102, or BS 103. Base stations 101-103 communicate with a plurality of<br>
mobile stations (MS) 111-114 over code division multiple access (CDMA)<br>
channels according to the iS-2000-C standard (i.e., Release C of cdmu2000).<br>
Mobile stations 111-114 may be any suitable wireless devices, including<br>
conventional cellular radiotelephones, PCS handset devices, personal digital<br>
assistants, portable computers, telemetry devices, and the like, which are capable<br>
of communicating with the base stations via wireless links.<br>
The present invention is not limited to mobile devices. Other types of<br>
wireless access terminals, including fixed wireless terminals, may be used. For<br>
the sake of simplicity, only mobile stations are shown and discussed hereafter.<br>
However, it should be understood that the use of the term "mobile station" in the<br>
claims and in the description below is intended to encompass both truly mobile<br>
devices (e.g., cell phones, wireless laptops) and stationary wireless terminals<br>
(e.g., monitoring devices with wireless capability).<br>
Dotted lines show the approximate boundaries of the cell sites 121-123<br>
in which base stations 101-103 are located. The cell sites are shown<br>
approximately circular for the purposes of illustration and explanation only. It<br>
should be clearly understood that the cell sites may have other irregular shapes,<br>
depending on the cell configuration selected and natural and man-made<br>
obstructions.<br>
As is well known in the art, cell sites 121-123 are comprised of a<br>
plurality of sectors (not shown), where a directional antenna coupled to the base<br>
station illuminates each sector. The embodiment of FIGURE 1 illustrates the<br>
base station in the center of the cell. Alternate embodiments position the<br>
directional antennas in comers of the sectors. The system of the present<br>
invention is not limited to any particular cell site configuration.<br>
In one embodiment of the present invention, BS 101, BS 102, and BS<br>
103 comprise a base station controller (BSC) and at least one base transceiver<br>
subsystem (BTS). Base station controllers and base transceiver subsystems are<br>
well known to those skilled in the art. A base station controller is a device that<br>
manages wireless communications resources, including the base transceiver<br>
subsystems, for specified cells within a wireless communications network. A<br>
base transceiver subsystem comprises the RF transceivers, antennas, and other<br>
electrical equipment located in each cell site. This equipment may include air<br>
conditioning units, heating units, electrical supplies, telephone line interfaces<br>
and RF transmitters and RF receivers. For the purpose of simplicity and clarity<br>
in explaining the operation of the present invention, the base transceiver<br>
subsystem in each of cells 121, 122, and 123 and the base station controller<br>
associated with each base transceiver subsystem are collectively represented by<br>
BS 101, BS 102 and BS 103, respectively.<br>
BS 101, BS 102 and BS 103 transfer voice and data signals between<br>
each other and the public switched telephone network (PSTN) (not shown) via<br>
communication line 131 and mobile switching center (MSC) 140. BS 101, BS<br>
102 and BS 103 also transfer data signals, such as packet data, with the Internet<br>
(not shown) via communication line 131 and packet data server node (PDSN)<br>
150. Packet control function (PCF) unit 190 controls the flow of data packets<br>
between base stations 101-103 and PDSN 150. PCF unit 190 may be<br>
implemented as part of PDSN 150, as part of base stations 101-103, or as a<br>
stand-alone device that communicates with PDSN 150, as shown in FIGURE 1.<br>
Line 131 also provides the connection path to transfer control signals between<br>
MSC 140 and BS 101, BS 102 and BS 103 used to establish connections for<br>
voice and data circuits between MSC 140 and BS 101, BS 102 and BS 103.<br>
Communication line 131 may be any suitable connection means,<br>
including a T1 line, a T3 line, a fiber optic link, or any other type of data<br>
connection. The connections on line 131 may transmit analog voice signals or<br>
digital voice signals in pulse code modulated (PCM) format, Internet Protocol<br>
(IP) format, asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) format, or the like. According<br>
to<br>
an advantageous embodiment of the present invention, line 131 also provides an<br>
Internet Protocol (IP) connection that transfers data packets between the base<br>
stations of wireless network 100, including BS 101, BS 102 and BS 103. Thus,<br>
line 131 comprises a local area network (LAN) that provides direct IP<br>
connections between base stations without using PDSN 150.<br>
MSC 140 is a switching device that provides services and coordination<br>
between the subscribers in a wireless network and external networks, such as the<br>
PSTN or Internet. MSC 140 is well known to those skilled in the art. In some<br>
embodiments of the present invention, communications line 131 may be several<br>
different data links where each data link couples one of BS 101, BS 102, or BS<br>
103 to MSC 140.<br>
In the exemplary wireless network 100, MS 111 is located in cell site<br>
121 and is in communication with BS 101. MS 113 is located in cell site 122 and<br>
is in communication with BS 102. MS 114 is located in cell site 123 and is in<br>
communication with BS 103. MS 112 is also located close to the edge of cell site<br>
123 and is moving in the direction of cell site 123, as indicated by the direction<br>
arrow proximate MS 112. At some point, as MS 112 moves into cell site 123 and<br>
out of cell site 121, a handoff will occur.<br>
According to the principles of the present invention, the mobile stations<br>
in wireless network 100 are capable of executing streaming data applications<br>
(e.g., video phone). To facilitate these high-speed applications, the present<br>
invention provides a means by which a first (or originating) mobile station<br>
operating via a first mobile switching center in a first wireless network can<br>
originate a packet data session that is terminated on a second (or terminating)<br>
mobile station operating via a second mobile switching center in a second<br>
mobile station. This capability does not exist in the prior art systems.<br>
FIGURE 2 illustrates telecommunication system 200, in which a mobile<br>
station-to-mobile station (MS-MS) packet data connection may be established<br>
across two wireless networks according to the principles of the present invention.<br>
Telecommunication system 200 provides the MS-MS packet data connection<br>
between originating mobile station (MS) 201 and terminating mobile station<br>
(MS) 202. Telecommunication system 200 comprises selected portions of a first<br>
(or originating) wireless network that receives the original packet data<br>
connection request from originating MS 201. The originating wireless network<br>
comprises originating base station (BS-O) 210, originating packet data serving<br>
node (PDSN-O) 212, and originating mobile switching center (MSC-O) 214.<br>
Telecommunication system 200 further comprises selected portions of a second<br>
(or terminating) wireless network that terminates the packet data connection at<br>
terminating MS 201. The terminating wireless network comprises terminating<br>
base station (BS-T) 210, terminating packet data serving node (PDSN-T) 212,<br>
and terminating mobile switching center (MSC-T) 214.<br>
Finally, telecommunication system 200 comprises switched network 230,<br>
server 240, and Internet protocol (IP) network 250. According to an<br>
advantageous embodiment of the present invention, switch network is an ANSI-<br>
41-compatible network and IP network 250 is the Internet or a similar wide area<br>
network (WAN). As will be explained below in greater detail, originating MSC<br>
214 and terminating MSC 224 initially transfer connection setup information<br>
between originating BS 210 and terminating BS 220 via switched network 230.<br>
Originating BS 210 and terminating BS 220 then use server 240 to exchange the<br>
connection setup information and establish a packet data session through<br>
originating packet data serving node 212, IP network 250, and terminating<br>
packet data serving node 222.<br>
The present invention assumes the following:<br>
i) The service provider maintains server 240 (or a gateway to server 240),<br>
which provides for information exchange between MS 201 and MS 202;<br>
ii) The network entities are as described in the IOS logical model<br>
defined in TIA-2000-D and utilize IOS signaling with some minor<br>
modifications;<br>
iii) The mobile stations use signaling as defined in TIA-2000-C, with<br>
some minor modifications;<br>
iv) Billing for the MS-MS packet data connection call is done at MSC<br>
214 and/or MSC 224 and is based only on air time; and<br>
v) The MS-MS packet data connection does not go dormant (i.e., mobile<br>
stations 201 and 202 stay on the traffic channels for the duration of the call).<br>
FIGURE 3 is a flow diagram illustrating the establishment of a mobile<br>
station-to-mobile station packet data call according to the principles of the<br>
present invention. FIGURES 2 and 3 indicate the signaling in the present<br>
invention that allows MS-MS packet data session setup. This signaling is based<br>
on messages defined in TIA-2000-D and TIA-2000-C, with exceptions as noted.<br>
The operator of originating mobile station 201 initiates a packet data<br>
session with the operator of originating mobile station 201. Using the menu on<br>
originating mobile station 201, the operator of originating MS 201 selects a MS-<br>
MS Packet Data Service option and is prompted to enter the phone number of<br>
terminating MS 202. Using the entered phone number, originating MS 201<br>
transmits to BS 210 the control signals needed to page terminating mobile<br>
station 202. Originating mobile station 201 may originate the call as a standard<br>
Packet Data Service (service option 33), but also includes the phone number of<br>
terminating MS 202 to indicate that this is an MS-to-MS packet data call<br>
(process step 305). In response, originating base station 210 establishes a bearer<br>
connection with originating PDSN 212, as with a conventional packet data call<br>
setup (process step 310). BS 210 also establishes a call connection to MSC 214.<br>
Next, originating MSC 214 determines that terminating mobile station<br>
202 is in another wireless network (i.e., locates MS 202) and sends paging<br>
request messages over the ANSI-41 network to terminating MSC 224. The<br>
paging request messages cause terminating MSC 224 to page terminating mobile<br>
station 202. Terminating MSC 224 receives the ANSI-41 messaging indicating<br>
an incoming data call. Terminating MSC 224 pages terminating mobile station<br>
202 and establishes a call connection through terminating base station 220. The<br>
service option used is S033 (process step 315). Terminating base station 220<br>
then establishes a bearer connection with terminating PDSN 222, as with a<br>
conventional packet data call setup (process step 320).<br>
At this point, a first packet data bearer connection exists from<br>
originating mobile station 201 to IP network 250 via PDSN 212 and a second<br>
packet data bearer connection exists from terminating mobile station 202 to IP<br>
network 250 via PDSN 222. As soon as the packet data connection on the<br>
originating side is established (i.e., a PPP connection between originating mobile<br>
station 201 and originating PDSN 212), originating mobile station 201 sends a<br>
message to server 240 indicating the mobile IP address of originating mobile<br>
station 201 and the phone number of terminating mobile station 202 (i.e., the<br>
called party) (process step 325).<br>
As soon as the packet data connection is established on the terminating<br>
side (i.e., PPP connection between terminating mobile station 202 and<br>
terminating PDSN 222), terminating mobile station 202 sends a message to<br>
server 240 indicating the mobile IP address of terminating mobile station 202<br>
and the phone number of terminating mobile station 202 (i.e., the called party)<br>
(process step 330). Once server 240 has received these information messages<br>
from both mobile stations, server 240 can send reply messages to each mobile<br>
station containing the IP address of the other mobile station (process steps 335<br>
and 340). Server 240 uses the phone number of terminating mobile station 202<br>
(i.e., the called party) as a common identifier for the call. If server 240 does not<br>
receive both messages after a fixed time, server 240 initiates a call tear down by<br>
indicating to the one mobile station from which server 240 did receive a message<br>
that the connection attempt has failed. Normal call teardown then begins, using<br>
established messages.<br>
Once each mobile station has received the IP address of the other mobile<br>
via a reply message from server 240, the mobile stations may establish a link<br>
layer connection (e.g., a PPP tunnel through IP network 250) or begin to<br>
exchange application messages directly (process step 345). Originating MS 201<br>
may, for example, request an FTP session on terminating MS 202 or establish an<br>
MS-MS video call over the data link.<br>
Call handoffs utilize the same messaging as is presently contained in<br>
TIA-2000-D and TIA-2000-C. In the event of an inter-PDSN handoff, the<br>
mobile may need to indicate to server 240 that its mobile IP address has changed.<br>
This information can then be passed to the other mobile, and the packet data<br>
session may continue. Call tear-down utilizes the same messages as packet call<br>
tear down in existing cdma2000 systems, and is illustrated in TIA-2000-D and<br>
TIA-2000-C.<br>
Although the present invention has been described in detail, those<br>
skilled in the art should understand that they may make various changes,<br>
substitutions and alterations herein without departing from the spirit and scope<br>
of the invention in its broadest form.<br>
