METHANOL TO FORMALDEHYDE, AND ALSO METHOD FOR<br>
November 23, 2006<br>
4465-X-24.117<br>
PRODUCTION THEREOF<br>
The present invention relates to a shell catalyst, specifically<br>
to a coated catalyst, especially for oxidizing methanol to<br>
formaldehyde, which, on an inert, preferably essentially<br>
nonporous, support body, has a coating composed of a<br>
composition which, as well as an active material, comprises an<br>
adhesion promoter composition which comprises at least one<br>
organic binder and at least one further, at least partly<br>
inorganic, adhesion-promoting component, especially a sol<br>
component.<br>
Molybdenum-iron catalysts for partial oxidation of methanol to<br>
formaldehyde have already been known for some time.<br>
The atomic ratios between molybdenum and iron can vary in these<br>
known catalysts. Moreover, a portion of the active components<br>
can be replaced partly by titanium, antimony, tin, nickel,<br>
chromium, cerium, aluminum, calcium, magnesium, vanadium,<br>
niobium, silver and/or manganese. Such catalysts comprising,<br>
for example, titanium are known for the partial oxidation of<br>
methanol to formaldehyde, for example, from US 3,978,136.<br>
However, in contrast to the inventive catalyst, this is not a<br>
coated catalyst.<br>
Coated catalysts are understood to mean catalysts which arise<br>
through coating of a (nonporous) support body with a porous<br>
layer of the actual active material.<br><br>
In contrast, in impregnation processes, the catalytically<br>
active sites (frequently noble metals such as Pd, Pt, Au, Ag<br>
etc.) are applied as a solution in disperse form to a porous<br>
support (frequently: SiO2, Al2O3, TiO2, ZrO2, carbon, Nb2O5 etc.) .<br>
In the catalysts prepared by the impregnation process,<br>
chemical-physical interactions usually exist between support<br>
and active sites, which have a crucial influence on the<br>
catalytic events. In contrast, in the case of coated catalysts,<br>
the support body serves merely for structural support. In<br>
contrast to impregnated catalysts, in which the active elements<br>
are present in dispersed form in the porous support - if<br>
appropriate also in an outer shell present in the support<br>
(= shell catalyst) - the (nonporous or essentially nonporous)<br>
support body in the coated catalyst is enveloped by the active<br>
material.<br>
US 3,975,302 describes an Fe/Mo catalyst prepared by the<br>
impregnation process for the oxidation of methanol to<br>
formaldehyde. According to this, iron and molybdenum are<br>
dissolved in water as MoO42- and Fe3+ salts and then impregnated<br>
onto a porous support with a BET surface area of from 1 to<br>
20 m2/g.<br>
US 4,181,629 also describes a catalyst for the oxidation of<br>
methanol to formaldehyde, which is prepared by impregnation in<br>
a fluidized bed process.<br>
EP-A-0 068 192 relates to an abrasion-resistant shell catalyst,<br>
for which the preferred binders in the shell composition are<br>
specified as glucose or urea in aqueous solution.<br>
EP-A-0 294 775 relates to a process for preparing a shell<br>
catalyst by spray application of the catalytically active<br>
material onto moving support particles at temperatures of from<br>
100 to 600°C.<br>
WO 98/23371 describes a coated catalyst for preparing acetic<br>
acid by gas phase oxidation of unsaturated C4 carbons. The<br><br>
catalyst comprises an inert nonporous support body to whose<br>
surface a catalytically active mixed oxide material has been<br>
applied. This material comprises (a) one or more oxides from<br>
the group of titanium oxide, zirconium dioxide, tin dioxide,<br>
aluminum oxide, and (b) based on the weight of component (a)<br>
and per m2/g of specific surface area of component (a), from 0.1<br>
to 1.5% by weight of vanadium pentoxide. A portion of vanadium<br>
pentoxide, preferably from 10 to 90% by weight, can be replaced<br>
by one or more oxides of molybdenum, chromium and antimony. If<br>
appropriate, as an additional component (b), one or more oxides<br>
of alkali metals, elements of main group 5 and 6 of the<br>
Periodic Table of the elements and the transition metals may<br>
also be present. Among other elements, iron is also mentioned.<br>
The proportion of these dopants is from 0.05 to 15% by weight,<br>
calculated as oxide and based on the total weight of component<br>
(b). The catalytically active mixed oxide material may<br>
optionally also contain 10 to 50% by weight, based on the total<br>
weight of the catalytically active mixed oxide material, of<br>
inert diluents such as silicon dioxide or silicon carbide. The<br>
binders used are organic binders. To prepare the catalysts, the<br>
active components are ground with addition of water.<br>
Subsequently, a copolymer dispersion of vinyl acetate and vinyl<br>
laurate is added. The finished suspension is applied to<br>
steatite spheres with evaporation of the water. The examples do<br>
not describe any catalyst which simultaneously comprises<br>
molybdenum and iron.<br>
WO 99/62637 describes a process for preparing shell catalysts<br>
for the catalytic gas phase oxidation of aromatic hydrocarbons.<br>
The catalyst consists of a support core and catalytically<br>
active metal oxides applied thereto in shell form. The catalyst<br>
is prepared by spraying an aqueous active composition<br>
suspension onto the hot support material. The active<br>
composition suspension comprises an organic binder. This binder<br>
is formed from (A) a polymer which is prepared from (a) from 5<br>
to 100% by weight of monomers in the form of ethylenically<br>
unsaturated acid anhydrides or ethylenically unsaturated<br><br>
dicarboxylic acids whose carboxyl groups can form an anhydride,<br>
and (b) from 0 to 95% by weight of monoethylenically<br>
unsaturated monomers, with the proviso that the monomers (a)<br>
and (b) have an average of at most 6 carbon atoms which are not<br>
functionalized with oxygen-containing groups, and (B) an<br>
alkanolamine having at least 2 OH groups, at most 2 nitrogen<br>
atoms and at most 8 carbon atoms, where the weight ratio of<br>
(A) : (B) is from 1 : 0.05 to 1 : 1. The catalytically active<br>
constituent used in the catalytically active composition is<br>
generally, as well as titanium dioxide in its anatase<br>
modification, vanadium pentoxide. In addition to these main<br>
constituents, a multitude of other oxidic compounds may be<br>
present, which, as promoters, influence the activity and<br>
selectivity of the catalyst. Examples of promoters include the<br>
alkali metal oxides, thallium(I) oxide, aluminum oxide,<br>
zirconium oxide, iron oxide, nickel oxide, cobalt oxide,<br>
manganese oxide, tin oxide, silver oxide, copper oxide,<br>
chromium oxide, molybdenum oxide, tungsten oxide, iridium<br>
oxide, tantalium oxide, niobium oxide, arsenic oxide, antimony<br>
oxide, cerium oxide and phosphorus pentoxide. Suspension of the<br>
active composition is applied to the support by spraying. This<br>
can be done, for example, in a coating drum or in a fluidized<br>
bed coater. The examples do not describe any catalyst which<br>
simultaneously possesses molybdenum and iron. Apart from the<br>
organic binder, no further binder is used.<br>
US 5,217,936 describes a catalyst for the preparation of<br>
aldehydes from the corresponding alcohols, especially of<br>
formaldehyde from methanol, wherein the catalytically active<br>
composition is applied to a monolithic support. The active<br>
composition may, as well as molybdenum oxide, also comprise<br>
oxides of chromium, vanadium, aluminum, iron, tungsten,<br>
manganese and mixtures thereof. In order to improve the binding<br>
of the active composition to the monolithic support, the active<br>
composition may comprise a binder. Suitable binders specified<br>
are silicon dioxide and titanium dioxide. The use of organic<br>
binders is not described.<br><br>
EP 1 108 470 A1 describes supported catalysts which are<br>
suitable for the gas phase oxidation of hydrocarbons. The<br>
supported catalysts consist of an active composition which is<br>
applied on an inert support body. The support body has the<br>
shape of a ring in which one or more notches are introduced on<br>
the upper and/or lower flat side of the ring.<br>
WO 99/61433 describes a process for preparing phthalic<br>
anhydride by catalytic gas phase oxidation of xylene or<br>
naphthalene, where a reactor which comprises at least three<br>
layers of a shell catalyst one on top of another, which have<br>
increasing activity from the gas inlet side toward the gas<br>
outlet side of the reactor, is used. The active composition is<br>
formed from oxides of vanadium and of antimony, of phosphorus,<br>
of the alkali metals and of titanium. The activity is adjusted<br>
by the amount of the active composition applied to the support<br>
bodies and by the content of alkaline metal in the active<br>
composition. The catalyst is prepared by spraying an aqueous<br>
suspension of the active composition onto inert support bodies,<br>
for example in a coating drum or in a fluidized bed coater. In<br>
order to reduce losses of active composition in the course of<br>
coating, the suspension may comprise an organic polymer as a<br>
binder. The use of inorganic binders is not described.<br>
DE 10 2004 014 918 describes a catalyst comprising a silver-<br>
vanadium oxide phase and a promoter phase based on titanium<br>
dioxide and vanadium pentoxide, which is suitable for the<br>
preparation of aldehydes, carboxylic acids and carboxylic<br>
anhydrides from aromatic or heteroaromatic hydrocarbons by gas<br>
phase oxidation. The catalyst is preferably configured as a<br>
shell catalyst, the two phases being arranged as concentric<br>
shells on an inert support. To prepare the shell catalyst, an<br>
aqueous slurry of the active materials is sprayed onto the<br>
support bodies with the aid of a coating drum or of a fluidized<br>
bed coater. A binder can be added to the slurry. Suitable<br>
binders specified are higher alcohols, DMF, cyclic ureas, etc.,<br>
and polymeric binders such as vinyl acetate/vinyl laurate<br><br>
copolymers. The use of inorganic binders is not described.<br>
WO 2005/037427 describes a catalyst bed composed of a physical<br>
mixture of catalytically active and catalytically inactive<br>
shaped bodies, the catalytically inactive shaped bodies having<br>
rounded edges on the outer friction surfaces. When the catalyst<br>
bed is used for the oxidation of methanol to formaldehyde, the<br>
catalytically active material used may, for example, be iron<br>
molybdates.<br>
EP 0 184 790 describes a shaped catalyst for heterogeneously<br>
catalyzed reactions, which consists of an inert support<br>
material shaped to hollow cylinders, on which a catalytically<br>
active material is applied. The external diameter of the hollow<br>
cylinder is from 3 to 20 mm and the internal diameter is from<br>
0.1 to 0.7 times the external diameter. The end surface of the<br>
hollow cylinder is curved such that the radius of curvature is<br>
from 0.4 to 5 times the external diameter. The catalysts are<br>
suitable especially for partial oxidations in the gas phase.<br>
However, there is a demand for improved catalysts for oxidizing<br>
methanol to formaldehyde, which, as well as a very good<br>
abrasion resistance, also have a good activity and selectivity.<br>
It was therefore an object of the present invention to provide<br>
improved catalysts, especially for the oxidation of methanol to<br>
formaldehyde, which have a particularly high abrasion<br>
resistance and avoid the disadvantages of the prior art.<br>
This object is achieved according to claim 1 by a shell<br>
catalyst or coated catalyst, especially for oxidation of<br>
methanol to formaldehyde, which, on an inert, preferably<br>
essentially nonporous, support body, has at least one coating<br>
which comprises, before the removal of the organic fractions of<br>
components b) and c):<br>
a) oxides, or precursor compounds convertible to the<br>
corresponding oxides, of molybdenum and iron, where the<br>
molar ratio of Mo:Fe is between 1:1 and 5:1, and<br><br>
optionally further metallic components or metal oxide<br>
components or precursor compounds convertible to the<br>
corresponding oxides,<br>
b)	at least one organic binder, preferably an aqueous<br>
dispersion of. copolymers, especially selected from vinyl<br>
acetate/vinyl laurate, vinyl acetate/ethylene, vinyl<br>
acetate/acrylate, vinyl acetate/maleate, styrene/acrylate<br>
or mixtures thereof,<br>
c)	and at least one further component selected from the<br>
group consisting of SiO2 sol or precursors thereof, Al2O3<br>
sol or precursors thereof, ZrO2 sol or precursors thereof,<br>
TiO2 sol or precursors thereof, waterglass, MgO, cement,<br>
monomeric, oligomeric or polymeric silanes,<br>
alkoxysilanes, aryloxysilanes, acryloyloxysilanes,<br>
aminosilanes, siloxanes or silanols.<br>
It has thus been found that, surprisingly, a coated catalyst or<br>
shell catalyst in which the coating composition of the support<br>
body, as well as the (catalytically) active composition<br>
comprising oxides or precursor compounds of molybdenum and iron<br>
which are convertible to the corresponding oxides (component<br>
a)), comprises a combination of at least one organic binder<br>
which is removed (burnt out) in the course of heat treatment or<br>
calcination, and at least one further component selected from<br>
the group of SiO2 sol and precursors thereof, A12O3 sol and<br>
precursors thereof, ZrO2 sol and precursors thereof, TiO2 sol<br>
and precursors thereof, waterglass, MgO, cement, monomeric,<br>
oligomeric or polymeric silane, alkoxysilane, aryloxysilane,<br>
acryloyloxysilane, aminosilane, siloxane or silanols exhibits a<br>
particularly high abrasion resistance. At the same time, it has<br>
been found that, unexpectedly, not only are the heat-untreated<br>
inventive coated catalysts, i.e. those comprising the organic<br>
parts of the coating composition, particularly abrasion-<br>
resistant, but there is still a particularly high abrasion<br>
resistance after the heat treatment or calcination of the<br>
inventive catalysts, and a porosimetry particularly favorable<br><br>
for the activity of the catalyst for the oxidation of methanol<br>
to formaldehyde is provided. In this case, the (as yet heat-<br>
untreated and uncalcined) catalyst in which the organic<br>
fractions of components b) and c) are yet to be removed can<br>
also be considered as a catalyst precursor or precursor<br>
catalyst. In the finished catalyst, as used for oxidation of<br>
methanol to formaldehyde, the organic fractions of components<br>
b) and c) are then removed, especially by heat treatment or<br>
calcination.<br>
Stated in simplified terms, the coating in the inventive coated<br>
catalysts, as well as the active composition (component a)),<br>
also comprises at least two components active as adhesion<br>
promoters. Of these, at least one component is an organic<br>
binder (component b)) which can be removed in the course of<br>
heat treatment and calcination of the catalyst. The second<br>
component (component c)) has at least one inorganic fraction or<br>
comprises a purely inorganic compound which, after the heat<br>
treatment or calcination of the coated catalyst, can<br>
advantageously form bridges between the oxidic constituents of<br>
the active composition, i.e. the molybdenum- and/or iron-<br>
containing oxides. The inorganic component or its inorganic<br>
fraction, without the invention being restricted to the<br>
correctness of the theoretical mechanism, apparently forms<br>
bonds between the primary particles of the iron oxides and/or<br>
molybdenum oxides, especially of the iron-molybdenum mixed<br>
oxide or of the other catalytically active components (a)). The<br>
organic compound b) and, where present, the organic fractions<br>
of the component c) (see above), in close association with the<br>
primary particles of the catalytically active component a), but<br>
without impairing the bridging thereof by the adhesion-<br>
promoting inorganic component or the inorganic fractions<br>
thereof, enable the formation of pores and hence, in the<br>
finished catalyst, the optimal access of the reactants to the<br>
active sites. In a particularly preferred embodiment, the<br>
component b) used is an organic binder from the group mentioned<br>
above. The use of this organic binder has the advantage that<br><br>
the coating operation can be accomplished in a fluidized bed<br>
apparatus with a particularly low level of spray losses. In<br>
addition, an advantageous pore structure forms at its removal.<br>
According to the invention, the coated catalyst at first<br>
comprises an inert support body. It is possible here in<br>
principle to use all inert support bodies familiar to the<br>
person skilled in the art. The support bodies should, however,<br>
preferably be essentially nonporous and have a BET surface area<br>
(determined to DIN 66131) of less about 1 m2/g. The pore volume<br>
of the inert, essentially nonporous support body should<br>
preferably be less than 0.1 ml/g, determined to DIN 66133. The<br>
material density of the support bodies is preferably in the<br>
range from 2.0 to 4.5 g/cm3, especially preferably from 2.3 to<br>
3.5 g/cm3. Examples of suitable support bodies are those<br>
composed of magnesium silicate (steatite), quartz (SiO2) ,<br>
porcelain, magnesium oxide, tin oxide, silicon carbide, rutile,<br>
alumina (Al2O3) , zirconium silicate, aluminum silicate, cerium<br>
silicate, or of mixtures of these support materials. Particular<br>
preference is given to steatite support bodies. It has been<br>
found that carbide-containing or sintered iron oxide support<br>
bodies provide poorer results.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the inert support<br>
bodies used are hollow cylinders. In a further preferred<br>
embodiment, the support body hollow cylinders used have one of<br>
the following sizes (external diameter x height x internal<br>
diameter):<br>
6 x 5 x 3, 6 x 5 x 4 ,6 x 4 x 4, 6 x 4 x 3, 5 x 5 x 3,<br>
4 x 4 x 2, 4 x 4 x 1.5, 5 x 4 x 3, 5 x 5 x 2.5, 5 x 3 x 3,<br>
4  x  3  x  1.5,  4 x 3 x 2,  3 x 3 x  1.5,  3 x  4  x  1.5,  in each case<br>
in mm.<br>
It has also been found that, surprisingly, particularly good<br>
results can be obtained with the inventive catalyst in the<br>
oxidation of methanol to formaldehyde when the support body<br><br>
hollow cylinders have at least one, preferably exactly one,<br>
central passage channel, and the end sides (exit sides of the<br>
passage channel) have (only) edges flattened on the outside,<br>
i.e. end surfaces which run at an acute angle (especially<br>
10-90°C, more preferably 30-85°, even more preferably 40-80°)<br>
relative to the axis of the passage channel; see fig. 1. It is<br>
also possible to use shaped bodies according to EP 1 127 618 Al<br>
or WO 2005/037427 Al.<br>
The above-described preferred support bodies in the shape of a<br>
cylinder with a passage channel and edges flattened on the<br>
outside at the ends offer the following advantages:<br>
1.	In the course of loading of the reactor, the shaped bodies<br>
do not as easily form locally ordered tight packings, but<br>
rather are arranged more irregularly, in which case more<br>
turbulences arise in the gas flow through the catalyst bed,<br>
which counter any slight onset of overheating, especially in<br>
the course of oxidation of methanol to formaldehyde. The<br>
reduction of the overheating also leads to an extension of<br>
the lifetime of the catalyst.<br>
2.	In the course of preparation of the catalyst in the<br>
preferred fluidized bed coater, there is less fracture at<br>
the edges than in the case of use of cylindrical bodies<br>
without flattened edges.<br>
3.	In the course of filling of the catalyst, the support with<br>
flattened edges fit together less than in the case of use of<br>
cylindrical bodies without flattened edges. This is<br>
especially true for the case that the value of reaction<br>
diameter to catalyst diameter is between about 2 and 5. The<br>
fitting together of the particles leads to filling gaps.<br>
At least one layer (shell) of a coating composition which<br>
initially comprises, as an active component a), at least one<br>
molybdenum compound and at least one iron compound or at least<br>
one Fe- and Mo-containing compound, where the molar ratio of<br>
Mo:Fe is preferably between about 1:1 and 5:1, is applied to<br><br>
the inert support body. Preference is given to using oxides of<br>
molybdenum or iron and/or mixed oxides thereof (such as Fe2<br>
(MoO4)3) or compounds which can be converted to the<br>
corresponding oxides or mixed oxides, for example acetates,<br>
oxalates, acetylacetonates, citrates, nitrates, chlorides,<br>
phosphates, sulfates, or ammonium compounds of iron or of<br>
molybdenum. In a particularly preferred embodiment of the<br>
invention, an iron-molybdenum mixed oxide (Fe2(MoO4)3) is used as<br>
the iron-containing compound, and MoO3 as the molybdenum-<br>
containing compound. In addition, in the above component a) , it<br>
is also optionally possible for further metallic components or<br>
metal oxide components, or compounds which can be converted to<br>
the corresponding oxides or mixed oxides, to be present, which<br>
are familiar to the person skilled in the art with regard to<br>
the use of the catalyst for oxidation of methanol to<br>
formaldehyde. Nonrestrictive examples are the lanthanide metals<br>
and oxides thereof. Preference is given to titanium, antimony,<br>
tin, nickel, cerium, aluminum, calcium, magnesium, chromium,<br>
vanadium, niobium, silver and/or manganese, which may also<br>
partly replace Fe and Mo.<br>
According to the invention, the coating of the inventive<br>
catalyst (before the removal of the organic fractions)<br>
comprises at least one organic binder (component b)). This<br>
binder improves the abrasion resistance of the coating and<br>
contributes to good adhesion of the coating on the inert<br>
support body. In addition, when an organic binder as defined<br>
herein is used, a particularly low spray loss and hence a<br>
particularly high application yield in the course of coating of<br>
the inert support bodies in the fluidized bed process<br>
(fluidized bed coater) are also achieved. In addition, it<br>
contributes to the formation of advantageous pores after the<br>
removal of the organic fractions of the coating composition. It<br>
has now been found that particularly advantageous results are<br>
obtained with aqueous dispersions of copolymers, especially<br>
vinyl acetate/vinyl laurate, vinyl acetate/ethylene, vinyl<br>
acetate/acrylate, vinyl acetate/maleate, or styrene/acrylate as<br><br>
organic binders. Such copolymers are familiar as such to those<br>
skilled in the art, can be prepared by standard methods and are<br>
commercially available. Suitable dispersions preferably have a<br>
solids content in the range from 20 to 80% by weight,<br>
preferably 40-60% by weight. Suitable binders include, for<br>
example, binder dispersions in which the binder is a copolymer<br>
of an alpha-olefin and of a vinyl C2-C4-carboxylate, whose vinyl<br>
C2-C4-carboxylate content is at least 62 mol%, as specified, for<br>
example, in WO 2005/011862.<br>
In addition, the coating composition of the inventive coated<br>
catalysts comprises at least one further component (c))<br>
selected from the group consisting of SiO2 sol or precursors<br>
thereof, Al2O3 sol or precursors thereof, ZrO2 sol or precursors<br>
thereof, TiO2 sol or precursors thereof, waterglass, MgO,<br>
cement, monomeric, oligomeric or polymeric silane,<br>
alkoxysilane, aryloxysilane, acryloyloxysilane, aminosilane,<br>
siloxane or silanols. These compounds are familiar as such to<br>
those skilled in the art, can be prepared by standard methods<br>
and are commercially available.<br>
Among the particularly preferred components, mention should be<br>
made here of the inorganic sols, especially TiO2 sols, cerium<br>
oxide sols and ZrO2 sols, since particularly good abrasion<br>
resistances and simultaneously high activities of the finished<br>
catalysts have been obtained here in the oxidation of methanol<br>
to formaldehyde.<br>
According to the sol, the solids content is between 10 and 50%<br>
by weight; for example, preference is given to SiO2 sols with<br>
solids content 20 - 40% by weight, ZrO2 sols with solids content<br>
10 - 20% by weight, CeO2 sols with solid content 15 - 25% by<br>
weight and TiO2 sols with solids content 10 - 20% by weight.<br>
TiO2 sols are particularly preferred.<br>
It has been found that, unexpectedly, the above components b)<br>
and c) cooperate in the generation of an optimal abrasion<br>
resistance and porosimetry of the catalyst. As a result of the<br><br>
adhesion promoter combination used in accordance with the<br>
invention (combination of the at least one component b) and at<br>
least one component c)), both adhesion and advantageous<br>
application of the coating composition or of the active<br>
material (component a)) on the shaped body, especially in the<br>
preferred fluidized bed process, and an open-pore structure and<br>
good adhesion of the active composition after the heat<br>
treatment or calcination of the catalyst are provided.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the integral pore<br>
volume (determined by Hg porosimetry, DIN 66133) is between<br>
about 100 - 800 mmVg, preferably between about 200 and<br>
700 mm3/g, more preferably between about 250 and 600 mm3/Vg. The<br>
mean pore radius determined by this method is preferably<br>
between about 50 and 1000 nm, preferably between about 100 and<br>
700 run, more preferably between about 150 and 500 nm.<br>
It has also been found that, surprisingly, the inventive heat-<br>
untreated catalyst (precursor catalyst), i.e. before the<br>
removal of the organic fractions of the coating composition,<br>
has a greatly improved transport and filling stability. One<br>
aspect of the present invention thus also relates to the use of<br>
an inventive catalyst, before the removal of the organic<br>
fractions of the coating composition (i.e. as a precursor<br>
catalyst), for the transport from the production site of the<br>
catalyst (or precursor catalyst) to the site of use of the<br>
catalyst, especially in the oxidation of methanol to<br>
formaldehyde. A further aspect relates to the use of such an<br>
inventive catalyst before the removal of the organic fractions<br>
of the coating composition (i.e. as a precursor catalyst) to<br>
fill a reactor, especially for oxidation of methanol to<br>
formaldehyde.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the component c)<br>
used is at least one sol with a particle size of 1 to 100 nm,<br>
preferably from 2 to 50 nm, more preferably 
particle sizes were determined to ASTM B822-97. Alternatively,<br><br>
ISO 13320-1 can also be used.<br>
More preferably, component c) has a smaller mean particle size<br>
than component(s) a).<br>
It is particularly preferred in this case that component c)<br>
comprises a ZrO2 sol, a CeO2 sol, a TiO2 sol or a mixture of two<br>
or all three of the above components. Moreover, it has been<br>
found that, surprisingly, particularly good abrasion<br>
resistances are obtained with a TiO2 sol which has been<br>
stabilized with nitric acid or with citric acid. In addition,<br>
good abrasion resistances have been found with a CeO2 sol<br>
stabilized with acetic acid or a mixture of the TiO2 sol and the<br>
CeO2 sol. It is particularly advantageous in this case when the<br>
TiO2 sol is present in excess over the CeO2 sol. In addition,<br>
good abrasion resistances have been found with a ZrO2 sol which<br>
has been stabilized with acetate.<br>
In addition to the sols provided in a solvent, it is also<br>
possible to use so-called aerosols, i.e. metal oxides which are<br>
provided as a solid with a very high specific surface area.<br>
Such finely divided solids can be prepared, for example, by<br>
flame hydrolysis, for example SiO2 by hydrolysis of SiCl4 in an<br>
H2/O2 flame. By comparable processes, it is also possible to<br>
prepare the other oxides mentioned above in finely divided<br>
form. However, the use of sols provided in a solvent is<br>
preferred, since the use of these sols leads to catalysts which<br>
exhibit a particularly high abrasion resistance. Moreover, in<br>
the case of use of sols in solvents, particularly low spray<br>
losses are achieved in the coating of the support bodies.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the solids content<br>
of component c) (i.e., for example, ZrO2 or TiO2) , after the<br>
removal of the organic fractions of components b) and/or c),<br>
especially after the calcination or heat treatment of the<br>
catalyst (i.e. in the finished catalyst), is between about 0.01<br>
and 30% by weight, preferably between 0.05 and 20% by weight,<br>
more preferably between 0.1 and 10% by weight, based on the<br><br>
catalytically active coating composition, i.e. the material of<br>
the shell. The corresponding use amounts of component c) can<br>
thus be determined easily by the person skilled in the art<br>
according to the component c) and component a) used.<br>
Moreover, it is preferred in accordance with the invention that<br>
the solids content of component b) is between 5 and 30% by<br>
weight, preferably between about 8 and 25% by weight, based on<br>
the catalytically active coating composition, i.e. the material<br>
of the shell. These data are of course based on the state<br>
before the removal of the organic fractions of the coating<br>
composition.<br>
In a further preferred embodiment of the invention, the active<br>
composition content (component (a) / (component (a) + inert<br>
support)) is between about 3 and 60% by weight, preferably<br>
between about 3 and 50% by weight, more preferably between<br>
about 5 and 40% by weight, based on the mass of inert support<br>
and catalytically active material. The geometries of the inert<br>
support bodies typically used give rise to a thickness, which<br>
is preferred in accordance with the invention, of the coating<br>
on the inert support body between about 30 and 1000 μm,<br>
preferably between about 100 and 700 μm.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention, in the inventive<br>
catalyst, after the removal of the organic fractions of the<br>
coating composition, the integral pore volume (to DIN 66133)<br>
based on the active composition is more than about<br>
0.15 ml/gactive composition, preferably more than 0.2 ml/gactive composition.<br>
A further aspect of the present invention relates to a process<br>
for preparing an inventive coated catalyst, especially for<br>
oxidizing methanol to formaldehyde, comprising the following<br>
steps:<br>
a)	providing an inert, preferably essentially nonporous,<br>
support body,<br>
b)	preparing an aqueous suspension comprising components a),<br><br>
b), c) as defined above,<br>
c) applying the aqueous suspension of step b) to the inert<br>
support body, preferably in a fluidized bed process.<br>
In a first step, an inert, preferably essentially nonporous,<br>
support body as described above is provided.<br>
In addition, an aqueous suspension comprising components a),<br>
b), c), as described above, is provided. In this context, it<br>
has been found to be particularly advantageous in accordance<br>
with the invention that all components a), b) and c) are<br>
present in particle form, either suspended or dispersed, and<br>
not in dissolved form. The solids content in the<br>
suspension/dispersion is preferably between 5 and 40% by<br>
weight, more preferably between 10 and 30% by weight.<br>
In the process according to the invention, it is preferred that<br>
the aqueous suspension provided is applied to the inert support<br>
body by means of a fluidized bed process. Preference is given<br>
to the use of a fluidized bed coater, as described, for<br>
example, in DE-A-12 80 756, DE-A-197 09 589, DE 40 06 935 Al,<br>
DE 103 44 845 Al or WO 2005/030388. It has been found in<br>
accordance with the invention that the aqueous suspension<br>
comprising the coating composition can be applied to the<br>
nonporous support body by means of a fluidized bed process, as<br>
detailed above, particularly uniformly and with good adhesion<br>
and with unexpectedly low spray losses.<br>
In addition, it has been found to be advantageous that the pH<br>
of the suspension is matched to the stability range of<br>
component b) and component c). It has been found that, for this<br>
purpose, a pH of the suspension to be applied to the support<br>
bodies of between about 1 and 5 is generally advantageous. It<br>
has also been found that a pH of about 3 - 5 is advantageous in<br>
the case of use of an acetate-stabilized ZrO2 sol, or a pH<br>
between 1 and 5, preferably between 1 and 3, in the case of use<br>
of a TiO2 sol stabilized with nitric acid. In the case of the<br>
CeO2 sol stabilized with acetic acid, a pH of 2 - 4 is<br><br>
particularly advantageous.<br>
In addition, it has been found that particularly favorable<br>
results are obtained when component a) is not heated to more<br>
than 200°C, and is especially not heat treated or calcined,<br>
before being applied to the inert support body.<br>
However, it is possible in one embodiment to calcine the active<br>
material (component a) before it is applied to the inert<br>
support body, in order, for example, to adjust its activity.<br>
However, preference is given to introducing the catalyst into<br>
the reactor in a form in which the shell of the catalyst<br>
comprises the uncalcined or low-calcination material and the<br>
organic binder. The active material can then be calcined<br>
simultaneously with the burning-off of the organic binder.<br>
In a further preferred embodiment of the invention, the aqueous<br>
suspension is applied to the inert support bodies in a<br>
fluidized bed process at a temperature of less than 100°C,<br>
especially at less than 80°C, more preferably less than 70°C.<br>
The particles of components a), b) and c) in the aqueous<br>
suspension preferably have a D90 value of the particle size of<br>
less than 50 urn, preferably less than 30 μm. Adhering to this<br>
particle size contributes to a particularly uniform and<br>
abrasion-resistant coating on the inert support bodies and<br>
leads to low spray losses during the coating operation. If<br>
materials which have the above particle size are not used in<br>
any case for components a), b) and c), this particle size can<br>
be established by conventional grinding or comminition before,<br>
during or after the preparation of the aqueous suspension.<br>
In a further preferred embodiment, after the application of the<br>
coating composition to the inert support body, the coated<br>
support body is treated thermally. In general, any temperature<br>
and duration for calcination or for heat treatment familiar to<br>
the person skilled in the art can be used. In many cases, a<br>
temperature between 200 and 600°C, especially 200 and 550°C,<br><br>
will be advantageous. The duration of the calcination or of the<br>
heat treatment will preferably be between 0.5 and 20 h,<br>
especially between 1 and 15 h. In a preferred embodiment, the<br>
coated support body will be introduced into a suitable heated<br>
cabinet, for example a tray oven with metal sheets, which<br>
contains the coated support bodies as a particle bed with a<br>
preferred bed height of 1 - 5 cm, more preferably of 1 - 3 cm.<br>
The heated cabinet is then preferably heated with a constant<br>
rate within a period of from 1 h to 20 h, preferably from 5 h<br>
to 15 h, from room temperature to a temperature T1 of<br>
preferably between 130 and 350°C, especially preferably from<br>
200 to 300°C. The heating rate for the above-described process<br>
step is preferably selected within the range from 0.1 to 5°<br>
C/min, more preferably from 0.2 to l°C/min. The temperature Tl<br>
is then preferably kept constant for the duration of from 1 h<br>
to 5 h. Subsequently, the temperature is heated at a preferably<br>
constant rate, within a period of from 1 h to 10 h, preferably<br>
from 1 h to 5 h, proceeding from the temperature Tl to an end<br>
temperature T2 between 300 and 600°C, preferably from 350 to<br>
550°C, more preferably from 400°C to 550°C. The heating rate<br>
for the above-described process step is preferably selected<br>
within the range from 0.1 to 10°C/min, more preferably from 2<br>
to 5°C/min. The temperature T2 is maintained for a duration of<br>
1 - 10 h, preferably of 2 - 5 h, and the heated cabinet is then<br>
cooled. Preference is given to selecting a cooling rate of<br>
1 - 10°C/min, more preferably of 2 - 8°C/min. During the<br>
thermal treatment, it may be advantageous to flow air or a<br>
mixture of air, nitrogen and optionally steam whose composition<br>
varies with time through the gas space of the heated cabinet.<br>
The organic binders preferred as component b) according to the<br>
above description have the advantage that they, even at the<br>
above relatively low coating temperatures in the fluidized bed<br>
coater, contribute very efficiently to the adhesion and<br>
abrasion resistance of the coating composition, and can<br>
simultaneously be removed at the temperatures preferred for the<br>
heating or calcination of the coated catalyst after the<br><br>
application of the coating to the inert support body without<br>
impairing the adhesion and abrasion resistance of the coating,<br>
in order to contribute to an advantageous pore structure.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the above-described<br>
heating after the application of the coating to the inert<br>
support body is effected in an atmosphere of air, inert gas<br>
and/or steam. When the heating is effected in the presence of<br>
steam, preference is given to a steam content of more than<br>
about 10% by volume, preferably between about 20 and 60% by<br>
volume, of the atmosphere used.<br>
If, as stated above, in a preferred aspect of the present<br>
invention, the inventive coated catalyst before the removal of<br>
the organic fractions of the coating composition is itself used<br>
to fill the reactor, it has also been found in the context of<br>
the present invention that the removal of the organic fractions<br>
of the coating composition (by means of heating or heat<br>
treatment or calcination of the catalyst) advantageously also<br>
directly in the reactor itself, especially in an O2- and N2-<br>
containing gas stream to which steam may optionally be added.<br>
The conditions for the calcination or the removal of the<br>
organic binder are preferably selected according to the<br>
conditions already described for the treatment of the catalyst.<br>
In a further preferred embodiment, the calcination can also<br>
take place under the operating conditions envisaged for the<br>
finished catalyst, such as the conditions of the envisaged<br>
methanol oxidation to formaldehyde.<br>
A further aspect of the invention relates to a catalyst<br>
obtainable by the above process. Such catalysts are notable for<br>
an increased abrasion resistance compared to prior art<br>
catalysts. Moreover, by virtue of an advantageous porosimetry<br>
after the removal of the organic fractions of the coating<br>
composition, a high activity and formaldehyde selectivity,<br>
especially in the oxidation of methanol, is ensured for the<br>
catalysts.<br><br>
A further aspect of the present invention thus relates to the<br>
use of the above-described coated catalyst for oxidizing<br>
methanol to formaldehyde, especially in a fixed bed process. A<br>
suitable process is known, for example, from DE 103 61 517,<br>
EP 0 001 570 and US 3,852,361. It is also possible to use other<br>
processes familiar to those skilled in the art for preparing<br>
formaldehyde. However, other applications of the catalyst,<br>
especially in partial (gas phase) oxidations of hydrocarbons,<br>
are not ruled out in principle.<br>
The gas phase oxidation is itself carried out in the reactors<br>
known for this reaction under customary conditions. Preference<br>
is given to tubular reactors, in which case the tubes are<br>
cooled for heat removal, for example, with a salt bath or a<br>
thermally stable oil. The tubes preferably have a diameter in<br>
the range from 15 to 30 mm, more preferably of 20 - 25 mm, and<br>
a length in the range of preferably from 80 to 140 cm. The<br>
inventive catalyst is filled into the tubes.<br>
A further aspect of the invention relates to the use of a<br>
combination of the above-described components b) and c) to<br>
increase the abrasion resistance of a coated catalyst,<br>
especially of a catalyst for the oxidation of methanol to<br>
formaldehyde.<br>
Figure 1 shows a cross section through a support body used with<br>
preference in accordance with the invention, with edges<br>
flattened on the outside at the ends. The acute angle a between<br>
the axis of the central passage orifice and the end faces is in<br>
each case about 60 degrees.<br>
Definitions of terms:<br>
a)	Active composition content = mass of active composition<br>
(component a)) / (mass of active composition (component<br>
a)) + mass of support body)<br>
b)	Solids content of component b = mass of solid in the org.<br>
binder (component b)) / (mass of solid in the org. binder<br><br>
(Component b)) + mass of active composition (component a)))<br>
c) Solids content of component c = mass of solid in component<br>
c) / (mass of solid in component c) + mass of active<br>
composition (component a)))<br>
According to the invention, the following determination methods<br>
were used:<br>
1.	Test for determining the adhesion of the active composition<br>
(abrasion test):<br>
The adhesion of the active composition was tested in an<br>
instrument from ERWEKA, model: TAR 10. To this end, an amount<br>
of 50 g of coated catalyst was rotated a total of 10 times at a<br>
rotational speed of 75 revolutions/min ( = 10 rotations of the<br>
drum). Thereafter, the abrasion was determined as the ratio of<br>
the loose coating no longer bonded to the support body relative<br>
to the total amount of coating applied.<br>
2.	BET surface area:<br>
The determination was effected by the BET method to<br>
DIN 66131; a publication of the BET method is also found in<br>
J. Am. Chem. Soc. 60, 309 (1938).<br>
3.	Pore radius distribution:<br>
The pore radius distribution was determined mercury<br>
porosimetry to DIN 66133; maximum pressure: 2000 bar,<br>
Porosimeter 4000 (from Porotec, Germany), according to the<br>
manufacturer's instructions.<br>
4.	Determination of the particle sizes:<br>
The particle sizes were determined by the laser diffraction<br>
method with a Fritsch Particle Sizer Analysette 22 Economy<br>
(from Fritsch, Germany) according to the manufacturer's<br>
instructions, also with regard to the sample pretreatment:<br>
the sample is homogenized in deionized water without addition<br>
of assistants and treated with ultrasound for 5 minutes. The<br><br>
D Values reported are based on the sample volume.<br>
The invention is illustrated in detail with reference to the<br>
nonrestrictive examples which follow:<br>
Example 1 (inventive):<br>
To prepare the inventive catalyst with an active composition<br>
content (component a)) of 20% by weight, a solids content of an<br>
organic binder (component b)) of 20% by weight and a solids<br>
content of the inorganic adhesion-promoting component c)) of 1%<br>
by weight, 700 g of steatite bodies (density 2.7 g/cm3) in the<br>
form of hollow cylinders of dimensions 5 x 5 x 2.5 mm were<br>
coated in a fluidized bed coater with a suspension which was<br>
prepared as follows:<br>
A glass vessel was initially charged with 1100 ml of<br>
demineralized water. 184 g of the active composition powder<br>
(mixture of Fe2(MoO4)3 and MoO3, prepared according to example 1<br>
of EP 1 674 156 A1 (molar Mo : Fe ratio = 2.5)) are suspended<br>
with stirring. For better homogenization, the suspension is<br>
treated with an Ultra - Turrax® at level 6 for 3 min. With<br>
stirring, 9.22 g of the ZrO2 sol (solids content 20%, acetate-<br>
stabilized, from Nyacol, trade name: NYACOL® Zirconia (Acetate))<br>
are added thereto. The pH of the suspension is adjusted to 4<br>
with a 25% ammonia solution. To the suspension are added 92 g<br>
of the organic binder (50% dispersion of water and vinyl<br>
acetate/ethylene copolymer, Vinnapas® EP 65 W, from Wacker), and<br>
the suspension is homogenized with stirring for one hour.<br>
The coating composition thus obtained is applied to the<br>
steatite bodies in a fluidized bed in the form of thin layers<br>
at a temperature between 60 - 8 0°C. The layer thickness of the<br>
catalytically active material on the outer wall of the hollow<br>
cylinder was 300 urn.<br>
At a temperature of 400°C or 500°C, a portion of the coated<br>
catalyst was treated thermally under air for a period of<br><br>
2 hours, in the course of which the organic fractions of the<br>
coating composition (the organic binder) were removed. The<br>
abrasion of the catalyst calcined at 400°C was 1.3% by weight;<br>
the abrasion of the catalyst calcined at 500°C was 3.1% by<br>
weight. The abrasion of the uncalcined catalyst was « 1%.<br>
The integral pore volume measured by means of Hg porosimetry is<br>
0.42 ml/g for the catalyst calcined at 400°C, and 0.37 ml/g for<br>
the catalyst calcined at 500°C.<br>
Example 2 (inventive):<br>
To prepare the inventive catalyst with an active composition<br>
content (component a)) of 20% by weight, a solids content of an<br>
organic binder (component b)) of 20% by weight and a solids<br>
content of the inorganic adhesion-promoting component c)) of<br>
4.7% by weight, 700 g of steatite bodies (density 2.7 g/cm3) in<br>
the form of hollow cylinders of dimensions 5 x 5 x 2.5 mm were<br>
coated in a so-called fluidized bed coater with a suspension<br>
which was prepared as follows:<br>
A glass vessel was initially charged with 1100 ml of<br>
demineralized water. 184 g of the active composition powder<br>
(mixture of Fe2(MoO4)3 and MoO3, prepared according to example 1<br>
of EP 1 674 156 A1 (molar (Mo : Fe ratio = 2.5)) are suspended<br>
with stirring. For better homogenization, the suspension is<br>
treated with an Ultra - Turrax® at level 6 for 3 min. With<br>
stirring, 76 g of the TiO2 sol (solids content 12%, stabilized<br>
with nitric acid, from Sachtleben, trade name: Hombikat™ XXS<br>
100) are added thereto. The pH of the suspension was 2.2. To<br>
the suspension are added 92 g of the organic binder (50%<br>
dispersion of water and vinyl acetate/ethylene copolymer,<br>
Vinnapas® EP 65 W, from Wacker), and the suspension is<br>
homogenized with stirring for one hour.<br>
The coating composition thus obtained is applied to the<br>
steatite bodies in a fluidized bed in the form of thin layers<br>
at a temperature between 60 - 80°C. The layer thickness of the<br><br>
catalytically active material was 305 μm.<br>
At a temperature of 400°C or 500°C, a portion of the coated<br>
catalyst was treated thermally under air for a period of<br>
2 hours, in the course of which the organic fractions of the<br>
coating composition (the organic binder) were removed. The<br>
abrasion of the catalyst calcined at 400°C was 2.7% by weight;<br>
the abrasion of the catalyst calcined at 500°C was 5.3% by<br>
weight. The abrasion of the uncalcined catalyst was « 1%.<br>
The integral pore volume measured by means of Hg porosimetry is<br>
0.44 ml/g for the catalyst calcined at 400°C, and 0.38 ml/g for<br>
the catalyst calcined at 500°C.<br>
Example 3 (inventive):<br>
To prepare the inventive catalyst with an active composition<br>
content (component a)) of 26% by weight, a solids content of an<br>
organic binder (component b)) of 20% by weight and a solids<br>
content of the inorganic adhesion-promoting component c)) of<br>
4.7% by weight, 700 g of steatite bodies (density 2.7 g/cm3) in<br>
the form of hollow cylinders of dimensions 5 x 5 x 2.5 mm were<br>
coated in a fluidized bed coater with a suspension which was<br>
prepared as follows:<br>
A glass vessel was initially charged with 1100 ml of<br>
demineralized water. 245 g of the active composition powder<br>
(mixture of Fe2(MoO4)3 and MoO3, prepared according to example 1<br>
of EP 1 674 156 A1 (molar (Mo : Fe ratio = 2.5)) are suspended<br>
with stirring. For better homogenization, the suspension is<br>
treated with an Ultra - Turrax® at level 6 for 3 min. With<br>
stirring, 46 g of the cerium oxide sol (solids content 20%, 3%<br>
acetic acid) are added thereto. The pH of the suspension is<br>
adjusted to 4 with a 25% ammonia solution. To the suspension<br>
