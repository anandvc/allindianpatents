				<td>Substituted heterocycles<br>
The present invention relates to substituted heterocycles, processes for their preparation, and their use in medicaments, especially for the treatment of inflammatory disease, i.e. asthma, or cancer.<br>
The multicatalytic proteinase or proteasome is a highly conserved cellular structure that is<br>
responsible for the ATP-dependent proteolysis of most cellular proteins. The 20S (700-kDa)<br>
proteasome contains at least five distinct proteolytic activities that have a new type of mechanism involving a threonine residue at the active site (Coux, O., Tanaka, K. and Goldberg, A. 1996 Ann.<br>
Rev. Biochem. 65:801-47).<br>
Although the 20S proteasome contains the proteolytic core, it cannot degrade proteins in vivo<br>
unless it is comp'lexed with a 19S cap at either end of its structure, which itself contains multiple ATPase activities. This larger structure is known as the 26S proteasome and rapidly degrades proteins that have been targeted for degradation by the addition of multiple molecules of the 8.5-<br>
kDa polypeptide, ubiquitin.<br>
It is now well established that the proteasome is a major extralysosomal proteolytic system which is involved in the degradative pathways resulting in numerous and diverse cellular functions such as cell division, antigen processing and the degradation of short lived regulatory proteins such as transcription factors, oncogene products and cyclins (reviewed in Ciechanover, A. 1994 Cell<br>
79:13-21), The primary function of the proteasome is to catalyze the proteolysis of proteins into small peptides. However, it has also been demonstrated that the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway can catalyze the regulated proteolytic processing of a large inactive precursor into an active protein.<br>
The best documented case of this involves the activation of the transcription factor NF-icB<br>
(Palombella, V. 1, Rando, O. I, Goldberg, A. L., and Maniatis, T. 1994 Cell 78:773-785). The<br>
active form of NF-KB is a heterodimer consisting of a p65 and a p50 subunit. The latter is present in the cytosol of the cell in an inactive precursor form, namely pi05, the 105-kDa polypeptide precursor of p50. The proteolytic processing of pi05 to generate p50 occurs via the ubiquitinproteasome pathway. Additionally, processed p50 and p65 is maintained in the cytosol as an inactive complex with the inhibitory protein MB. Inflammatory signals activate NF-KB by initiating the signalling pathway for the complete degradation of MB, and also stimulate the processing of p!05 into p50. Thus two proteolytic events, both governed by the ubiquitinproteasome pathway, are required for signal induced activation of NF-KB.<br>
Once activated, NF-icB translocates to the nucleus, where it plays a central role in the regulation of a remarkably diverse set of genes involved in the immune and ioflammatory responses (Grilli et<br>
al., International Review of Cytology (1993) 143:1-62). For example, NF-icB is required for the expression of a"number'of genes involved in the inflammatory response, such as TNF-a gene and genes encoding the cell adhesion molecules E-selectin, P-selectin, ICAM, and VCAM (Collins, T., Lab. Invest. (1993) 68:499). NF-KB is also required for the expression of a large number of cytokine genes such as IL-2, IL-6, granulocyte colony stimulating factor, and IFN-p. Inducible nitric oxide synthetase is also under regulatory control of NF-KB. Proteasome inhibitors block IxBa degradation and activation of NF-KB (Palombella et al. WO 95/25533 published Sep. 28, 1995; Traenckner, et al., EMBO J. (1994) 13:5433). Proteasome inhibitors also block TNF-a induced expression of the leukocyte adhesion molecules E-selectin, VCAM-1, and ICAM-1 (Read, et al., Immunity (1995) 2:493).<br>
The fact that the proteasome plays a critical event in the activation of NF-KB could be exploited clinically by the use of inhibitors directed towards proteasome proteolysis. In certain diseases the<br>
normal function of active NF-KB can be detrimental to human health as observed in inflammatory<br>
responses. Thus inhibitors of NF-KB activation, due to their ability to prevent secretion of various<br>
inflammatory molecules such as cell adhesion molecules or cytokines, may have potential utility<br>
in the treatment of inflarrrmatory disorders such as inflammatory disorders including, for example,<br>
allergy, COPD, airway inflammation and asthma, ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome),<br>
AIDS, osteo arthritis and rheumatoid arthritis; inflammatory bowel disease, including ulcerative<br>
colitis and Crohn's disease; sepsis; transplant rejection and ischemia or reperfusion injury,<br>
including stroke and myocardial infarction.. Since activation of NF-KB is also essential for<br>
angiogenesis, proteasome inhibitors may have utility in the treatment of the diseases associated<br>
with abnormal neovascularization.<br>
p53 was first described as an oncoprotein but has since been shown to be involved in many<br>
cellular processes (reviewed by Ko, L. J. and Proves, C. 1996 Genes Dev. 10, 1054-1072). p53 has<br>
been shown to induce apoptosis in several haematopoietic cell lines (Oren, M., 1994 Semin.<br>
Cancer Biol. 5, 221-227) through the action of many different stimuli including DNA damage,<br>
viral infection and the removal of growth factors. However, it is important to note that apoptosis<br>
can be induced in a p53-independent manner for example by the action of glucocorticoids.<br>
Induction of p53 leads to cell growth arrest in the Gl phase of the cell cycle as well as cell death<br>
by apoptosis. Both of these functions allow p53 to control DNA damage thereby reducing the<br>
propagation of DNA mutations when cells divide. p53 arrests cells at Gl by inducing the cyclindependent<br>
kinase inhibitor, p21, which in turn causes an accumulation of the hypophosphorylated<br>
form of the retinoblastoma gene product. It is thought that p53 acts as a check point in the cell<br>
following DNA damage, it first causes an arrest in cell division and apoptosis. p53 degradation is<br>
known to be via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway and disrupting p53 degradation is a possible<br>
mode of inducing apoptosis. Another potential utility of proteasome inhibitors may be in the<br>
treatment of diseases that result from abnormal cell proliferation.<br>
It is well documented that the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway is critical for the regulated<br>
destruction of cyclins that govern the exit from mitosis and allow cells to progress into the next<br>
phase of the cell cycle. Thus inhibiting degradation of cyclins by using proteasome inhibitors<br>
causes growth arrest. Therefore another potential utility of proteasome inhibitors is their use in the<br>
treatment of diseases that result from an accelerated cell division. These include cancer,<br>
cardiovascular diseases such as myocarditis, restenosis following angioplasty, renal diseases such<br>
as lupus, polycystic kidney disease, fungal infections, dermatological diseases such as psoriasis,<br>
abnormal wound healing, keloids, immunological diseases such as autoimrnum'ty, acute and<br>
delayed hypersensitivity, graft versus host disease, transplant rejection and neuroimmunological<br>
diseases such as multiple sclerosis and acute disseminated encephalomyelitis.<br>
Several microbial metabolites were found to inhibit the proteasome. For instance, some peptidic<br>
compounds have been reported from streptomycetes such as the TMC-96 series (Y. Koguchi et al.,<br>
J. Antibiot., 1999, 52, 63-65 and J. Antibiot., 2000, 53, 1069-1076) and fungi such as the TMC-95<br>
series (J. Kohno et al., J. Org. Che?n., 2000, 65, 990-995) as strong inhibitors of this target. Nonpeptidic<br>
actinomycete metabolites possessing a beta-lactone moiety or their respective chemical<br>
analogues have also been claimed to strongly interact with this target. Among those are the<br>
Salinosporamides from marine actinomycete Salinospora sp. known from WO 02/47610 and R.<br>
Feling et al., Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2003, 42, 355-357 (Salinosporamide A), and lactacystin'<br>
p-lactones known from WO 96/32105, WO 99/15183 and WO 99/09006.<br>
Salinosporamide E and Salinosporamide G are known from the 10th Internal Symp. on Marine<br>
Natural Prod, in Okinawa 2001 and "Salinosporamide-A" is known form the 50th Annual Congress<br>

with thioles.<br>
Formula (I) contains the compounds of formula (Ib), (Ic), (Id) and (le).<br>
Formula (II) contains the compounds of formula (lib), (He) and (US).<br>
Process [A] and [E] can be carried out as described in the experimental section or<br>
Streptomyces sp. JS 360 is fermented in an aqueous nutrient medium under submerged aerobic<br>
conditions. Typically the microorganism is fermented in a nutrient medium containing a carbon<br>
source and a proteinaceous material. Preferred carbon sources include glucose, brown sugar,<br>
sucrose, glycerol, starch, com starch, lactose, dextrin, molasses, and the like. Preferred nitrogen<br>
sources include cottonseed flour, corn steep liquor, yeast, autolysed brewer's yeast with milk<br>
solids, soybean meal, cottonseed meal, corn meal, milk solids, pancreatic digest of casein,<br>
distillers' solids, animal peptone liquors, meat and bone scraps, and the like. Combinations of these<br>
carbon and nitrogen sources can be used advantageously. Trace metals, for example, zinc,<br>
magnesium, manganese, cobalt, iron and the like need not be added to the fermentation medium<br>
since tap water and unpurifie'd ingredients are used as medium components.<br>
Production of compounds can be induced at any temperature conductive to satisfactory growth of<br>
the microorganisms between about 23° and 32°C and preferably at about 28°C. Ordinarily,<br>
optimum production of compounds is obtained in about 2 to 6 days of fermentation, and preferably<br>
in about 4 to 5 days of fermentation. The fermentation broth normally remains weakly to<br>
moderately acidic during the fermentation, and advantageously the fermentation is terminated at<br>
pH of 4-4.5. The final pH is dependent, in part, on the buffers present, if any, and in part, on the<br>
initial pH of the culture medium. It is advantageously adjusted to about pH 6.5-7.5, and preferably<br>
7.2, prior to sterilisation.<br>
Production takes out in shake flask but also in solid media and stirred fermentors. When growth is<br>
carried out in shake flasks or large vessels and tanks, it is preferable to use the vegetative form,<br>
rather than the spore form, of the microorganism for inoculation to avoid a pronounced lag in the<br>
production of the compounds and the attendant inefficient utilisation of the equipment.<br>
Accordingly, it is desirable to produce a vegetative inoculum in an aqueous nutrient medium by<br>
inoculating this medium with an aliquot from a soil or a slant culture. When a young, active<br>
vegetative inoculum has thus been secured, it is transferred aseptically to other shake flasks or<br>
other suitable devices for fermentation of microorganisms. The medium in which the vegetative<br>
inoculum is produced can be the same as, or different from, that utilised for the production of<br>
compounds, as long as it is such that adequate growth of the microorganism is obtained.<br>
In general, seeding of Streptomyces sp. JS360 and fermentation and the production of compounds<br>
in submerged aerobic fermentation in stirred vessels is utilised. The production is independent of<br>
used containers, fermentors and starter proceedings. The compounds can also be obtained by<br>
shake-flask culture. For large volume fermentations it is preferable to use a vegetative inoculum.<br>
The vegetative inoculum is prepared by inoculating small volume of culture medium with the<br>
spore form, mycelial fragments, or a lyophilised pellet of the organism. The vegetative inoculum<br>
is then transferred to a fermentation vessel where, after a suitable incubation time, compounds are<br>
produced in optimal yield.<br>
As is customary in aerobic submerged culture process, sterile air is dispersed through the culture<br>
medium. For efficient growth of the organism, the volume of the air used is in the range of from<br>
about 0.25 to about 0.5 volume of air per volume of culture medium per minute (wm). An<br>
optimum rate in a 10 1 vessel is about 0.3 wm with agitation provided by conventional impellers<br>
rotating at about 240 rpm. Adding of small amount (i. e. 1 ml/1) of an antifoaming agent such as<br>
silicone to fermentations media is necessary if foaming becomes a problem. Preferred<br>
fermentation conditions and media are given in General Experimental Procedures<br>
Compounds are present in the biomass of the fermentated Streptomyces sp. JS 360, as well as in<br>
the culture filtrate of the fermentation broth. The culture broth can be separated by filtering on a<br>
filter press.<br>
A variety of procedures can be employed to isolate and -purify the compounds from the<br>
fermentation broth, for example, by chromatographic adsorption procedures followed by elution<br>
with a suitable solvent, column chromatography, partition chromatography, and crystallisation<br>

In the preferred recovery process, the compounds are' extracted from the whole beer, from the<br>
mycelia or from extracts of the supernatant. The latter can be prepared by using adsorbant resins<br>
such as XAD, HP 20 or Bayer Lewapol. Column chromatography techniques, preferably over<br>
silica gels or modified silica gels, are used to perform the initial purification. Final purification of<br>
the compounds is preferably achieved by preparative High Performance Liquid Chromatography<br>
(HPLC).<br>
The hydrogenation in process [B] can be carried out in the presence of an catalyst such as<br>
palladium/charcoal and hydrogen in a suitable solvent in a temperature range from 0°C to +100°C,<br>

In another embodiment, the present invention relates to the composition containing at least one compound of general formula (I) and a pharmacologically acceptable diluent and the use of such composition for the treatment of acute and chronic inflammatory processes or cancer as well as the process for the preparation of such compositions, characterized in that the compounds of general formula (I) together with customary auxiliaries in brought into a suitable application form. The compounds of general formula (I) are therefor useful for the preparation of medicaments, especially of medicaments for the treatment of acute and chronic inflammatory processes, especially COPD, or cancer. For the treatment of the above-mentioned diseases, the compounds according to the invention can<br>
exhibit non-systemic or systemic activity, wherein the latter is preferred. To obtain systemic<br>
activity the active compounds can be administered, among other things, orally or parenterally,<br>
wherein oral administration is preferred. To obtain non-systemic activity the active compounds<br>
can be administered, among other things, topically.<br>
For parenteral administration, forms of administration to the mucous membranes (i.e. buccal,<br>
lingual, sublingual, rectal, nasal, pulmonary, conjunctival or intravaginal) or into the interior of the body are particularly suitable. Administration can be carried out by avoiding absorption (i.e. intracardiac, intra-arterial, intravenous, intraspinal or inlralumbar administration) or by including absorption (i.e. intracutaneous, subcutaneous, percutaneous, intramuscular or intraperitoneal administration).<br>
For the above purpose the active compounds can be administered per se or in administration<br>
forms. <br>
Suitable administration' forms for oral administration are, inter alia, normal and enteric-coated tablets, capsules, coated tablets, pills, granules, pellets, powders, solid and liquid aerosols, syrups, emulsions, suspensions and solutions. Suitable administration forms for parenteral administration are injection and infusion solutions.<br>
The active compound can be present in the administration forms in concentrations of from 0.001 - 100 % by weight; preferably the concentration of the active compound should be 0.5 - 90% by weight, i.e. quantities which are sufficient to allow the specified range of dosage.<br>
The active compounds can be converted in the known manner into the above-mentioned<br>
administration forms using inert non-toxic pharmaceutically suitable auxiliaries, such as for<br>
example excipients, solvents, vehicles, emulsifiers and/or dispersants.<br>
The following auxiliaries can be mentioned as examples: water, solid excipients such as ground natural or synthetic minerals (e.g. talcum or silicates), sugar (e.g. lactose), non-toxic organic<br>
solvents such as paraffins, vegetable oils (e.g. sesame oil), alcohols (e.g. ethanol, glycerol), glycols<br>
(e.g. polyethylene glycol), emulsifying agents, dispersants (e.g. polyvinylpyrrolidone) and<br>
lubricants (e.g. magnesium sulphate).<br>
In the case of oral administration tablets can of course also contain additives such as sodium<br>
citrate as well as additives such as starch, gelatin and the like. Flavour enhancers or colorants can<br>
also be added to aqueous preparations for oral administration.<br>
For the obtainment of effective results in the case of parenteral administration it has generally<br>
proven advantageous to administer quantities of about 0.001 to lOOmg/kg, preferably about<br>
0.01 to 1 mg/kg of body weight. In the case of oral administration the quantity is about 0.01 to<br>
100 mg/kg, preferably about 0.1 to 10 mg/kg of body weight.<br>
In spite of this, it can be necessary in certain circumstances to depart from the amounts mentioned,<br>
namely as a function of body weight, application route, individual behaviour towards the active<br>
component; manner of preparation and time or interval at which application takes place. It can for<br>
instance be sufficient in some cases to use less than the aforementioned minimum amount, while<br>
in other cases the upper limit mentioned will have to be exceeded. In the case of the application of<br>
larger amounts, it can be advisable to divide them into a plurality of individual doses spread<br>
through the day.<br>
The percentages in the tests and examples which follows are, unless otherwise stated, by weight;<br>
parts are by weight. Solvent ratios, dilution ratios and concentrations reported for liquid/liquid<br>
solutions are each based on the volume.<br>

General Experimental Procedures<br>
Chemicals are obtained in analytical grade from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany) or Sigma-Aldrich<br>
(Deisenhofen, Germany). NMR spectra are recorded in DMSO-d6. using a Bruker DRX 500<br>
spectrometer (operating at 500.13 MHz proton frequency).<br>
HPLC-MS analyses are performed using a Agilent HP 1100 liquid chromatograph coupled with a<br>
LCT mass spectrometer (Micromass, Manchester, UK) in the positive and negative electrospray<br>
ionisation (ESI) mode, based on slight modification of a previously described method (M. Stadler<br>
et al., Phytochemistry 2001, 56, 787-793). A Waters symmetry column is used as stationary phase.<br>
Mobile phase A: 0.1 % formic acid in water, mobile phase B: 0.1 % formic acid in acetonitrile;<br>
gradient: 0-1 min. 100 % A, from 1-6 min. to 90 % B, from 6 to 8 min to 100 %B, from 8-10 min<br>
100 % B. LC-MS spectra are recorded in the range of molecular weights between 150 and 1.600.<br>
HPLC-UV/Vis analyses are carried out in analogy to M. Stadler et al., Mycol. Res., 2001, 105,<br>
1190-1205 on a HP 1100 Series analytical HPL'C system (Agilent, Waldbronn, Germany)<br>
comprising a G 1312A binary pump system, a G 1-315A diode array detector, a G 1316A column<br>
compartment, a G 1322A degaser and a G 1313A autoinjector. As mobile phase, 0.01%<br>
phosphoric acid: acetonitrile is chosen, while a Merck (Darmstadt, Germany) Lichrospher RP <br>
column (125 x 4 mm, particle size 7 um) serves as stationary phase. Aliquots of the samples<br>
(representing 2 — 10 ug of methanol-soluble materials, according to the concentrations of main<br>
metabolites) are analysed at 40°C with a flow of 1 ml/min in the following gradient: Linear from<br>
0% acetonitrile to 100% acetonitrile in 10 min, thereafter isocratic conditions at 100% acetonitrile<br>
for 5 min; followed by regeneration of the column for 5 min. HPLC-UV chromatograms are<br>
recorded at 210 run with a reference wavelength of 550 nm and a bandwidth of 80 run. Diode array<br>
detection (DAD) is employed to record HPLC-UV/Vis spectra in the range of 210 - 600 nm. The<br>
HP ChemStation software allows for an automated search for calibrated standard compounds in<br>
crude extracts.<br>
Preparative HPLC is-performed at room temperature on a preparative HPLC .system (Gilson<br>
Abimed, Ratingen, Germany), comprising Gilson Unipoint software, 306 binary pump system, 205<br>
fraction collector, 119 UV-Vis detector, 806 manometric module, and 811C dynamic mixer, using<br>
different gradients and stationary phases as described below.<br>
NMR spectra are recorded on a Bruker DMX500, operating at 500.13 MHz proton frequency. All<br>
spectra are measured in DMSO-d^ solution at 302 K. The solvent peak is used as internal reference<br>
for both proton and carbon chemical shifts (5H: 2.50, 8C: 39.5).<br>

Strain JS360 is obtained from a' soil sample collected in Japan. It is maintained at the Bayer AG<br>
culture collection (Wuppertal, Germany) in 10% glycerol under liquid nitrogen. It has also been<br>
deposited at DSMZ (Deutsche Sammlung fur Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen, Mascheroder<br>
Weg Ib, D-38124 Braunschweig, Germany), on November 27, 2002 under the designation number<br>
DSM 15324.<br>
Strain identification<br>
The morphological, cultural' and physiological characteristics of strain JS360 indicate that the<br>
strain constitutes an undescribed species of the genus Streptomyces.<br>
Morphology<br>
On YMG medium, single colonies of strain JS360 attain a diameter of 24 mm after incubation for<br>
12 days at 28°C. The colonies develop a white, fluffy aerial mycelium, while the substrate<br>
mycelium is creamish. The reverse of the culture is reddish brown, and a reddish pigment is<br>
released into the medium.<br>
165 rDNA (SEQ ID NO: 1) sequencing<br>
•Comparisons of the 16S rDNA (SEQ ID NO: 1) sequences are carried out to further characterize<br>
strain JS360 on its taxonomic position. Thus, DNA extraction and sequencing of the main part of<br>
the 16S rRNA gene is amplified in analogy to Mincer TJ, Jensen PR, Kaufmann CA, Fenical W.<br>
2002. Appl. Environ. Microbiology 60 (10) 5005-5011 a PCR using primers 41f and 1486r-P<br>
(unpublished), applying a standard thermal profile with an annealing temperature of 50°C.<br>
Amplification products are purified using DNA binding paramagnetic beads (Mag Prep PCR<br>
Clean Up Kit, Tecan Schweiz AG, Hornbrechtikon, Switzerland) using 'the protocol supplied by<br>
the manufacturer.<br>
Nucleotide sequences are obtained by cycle sequencing using the Thermo Sequenase Cy5.5 Dye<br>
Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit (Amersham Biosciences), primer 41f, and the LI-COR 4200<br>
Genetic Analyzer (LI-COR Inc. Lincoln, Nebraska, USA). A search for sequences similar to the<br>
ones determined and accompanying alignments with the best matches are obtained by FASTA as<br>
provided as an on-line service by the Europaean Bioinformatics Institute (EBI)<br>
(http://www.ebi.ac.uk/fasta33/). The sequences showing the best matches are obtained from the<br>
database to be used as input for the MegAlign module of the LASERGENE software (DNASTAR<br>
me, Madison, Wisconsin, USA.). Sequences of Salinospora sp. published by Mincer et al., Appl.<br>
Environm. Microbiol., 2002, 68, 5005-5011, are also taken into consideration.<br>
The following nucleotide sequences are used for comparison:<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
About 240 bases of sequence are obtained from strain JS360 (Fig. 5). The sequence is used as a FASTA input to search for similar sequences in the EMBL databank. The sequence is found to be closely related to 16S rRNA sequences of members of Streptomyces. Among the three best matches are two unnamed streptomycete isolates from soil and an earthworm, respectively, and one.isolate of Streptomyces cinnabarinus. The similarity between these three and the sequence obtained from JS360 is in the range of 91%. No identical sequence is found in the database. An alignment (Clustal method) is done including the sequence of JS360 and three of the most similar sequences as well as six sequences of Salinospora species. From the alignment, a dendrogram is constructed to demonstrate the phylogenetic relationships, A clear destination is found between Salinospora sp. and the group including JS360 (Fig. 6). .The results reveal JS360 to be clearly distinct from Salinospora spp. The strain belongs to the genus Streptomyces as concluded from the alignment of its partial 16S rDNA sequence. <br>
Fermentation and extraction of strain JS360<br>
1: Seed culture<br>
Two rnl of a 10%~glycerol culture are used to inoculate 1 1 Erlenmeyer flasks'containing<br>
150 ml of sterile YMG medium and propagated on a rotary shaker at 28°C and 240 rpm<br>
for 72-96 h.<br>
Fermentation of strain JS360 in flask scale<br>
After inoculation from a well-grown YMG seed culture (2 ml inoculum per flask), strain<br>
JS360 is propagated in ten 1 1 Erlenmeyer flasks containing 150 ml of Q6 medium (see<br>
above) and propagated on a rotary shaker at 28°C and 240 rpm for 11.8 h. During<br>
fermentation, daily samples are taken. The pH is determined, and free glucose is estimated<br>
using Bayer Diastix Hamzuckerstreifen. The wet mycelium is separated from the fluid by<br>
centrifugation (10 min. at SOOOxg) and extracted with 2 1 of acetone. The acetone is<br>
evaporated in vacuo (40°C). The remaining aqueous residue is diluted with water to<br>
500ml and extracted three times with equal amounts of ethyl acetate. The combined<br>
organic phases are dried over sodium sulfate and evaporated in vacuo (40°C) to yield<br>
830 mg of crude extract, which is thereafter subjected to preparative HPLC as described<br>
below (isolation).<br>
The culture fluid is applied onto an adsorption column containing 500 ml of Bayer<br>
Lewapol CA 9225 resin and rinsed with 1 1 water. The column is eluted with 1.5 1<br>
acetone:methanol 4:1. The solvent is evaporated in vacuo (40°C). The remaining aqueous<br>
residue is diluted with water to 500 ml and extracted three times with equal amounts of<br>
ethyl acetate. The combined organic phases are dried over sodium sulfate and evaporated<br>
in vacuo (40°C) to yield 650 mg of crude extract, which is thereafter subjected to<br>
preparative HPLC as described below (isolation).<br>
3j Fermentation of strain JS360 in 30 1 scale (stirring fermentor)<br>
A 40 1 Biostat P fermentor (Braun Bioengeneering, Melsungen, Germany) containing 30 1<br>
of Q6 medium is sterilized in situ (1 h at 121 °C and 1.1 bar) and inoculated with two wellgrown<br>
150 ml YMG seed cultures that have been propagated for 76 h. The production<br>
culture is grown under stirring (240 rpm) and aeration (0.3 wm). The pH is determined,<br>
and free glucose is estimated using Bayer Diastix Hamzuckerstreifen. In addition, the<br>
fermentor is equipped with a Braun oxygen electrode to determine oxygen saturation of<br>
the culture broth. Analytical HPLC of crude extracts prepared from 50 ml samples taken<br>
under sterile conditions and extracted with equal, amounts of ethyl acetate serve as a means<br>
of detection for example 1. Examples 2 to 5 and 7 are also detected during fermentation by<br>
HPLC-MS but cannot be estimated in the native crude extracts, due to limited amounts and<br>
co-eluting other metabolites with similar retention "times in the employed HPLC system.<br>
The ethyl acetate extracts are dried over sodium sulfate, evaporated to dryness, redissolved<br>
in methanol and analyzed using the HPLC-UV systems described in General Experimental<br>
Procedures. A typical time course of the fermentation of JS360 in 30 1 Q6 medium is<br>
depicted in Fig. 1. While the culture is fully saturated as deduced from the oxygen<br>
saturation values, the pH drops to values of ca. 4.5. After the free glucose in the medium is<br>
consumed, production of example 1 as estimated by analytical HPLC methodology starts<br>
at about 60 h of fermentation and reaches an optimum after 114 h. Then, the culture is<br>
harvested because at later stages degradation of example 1 is observed. After harvest of<br>
the culture, the fluid is separated from the mycelium by centrifugation (10 min. at<br>
3000 x g) and applied onto a column filled with Bayer Lewapol CA 9225 adsorption resin<br>
and rinsed with 5 1 water. The column is thereafter eluted with 6 1 acetonermethanol 4:1.<br>
The eluates are evaporated in vacua (40°C) to yield an aqueous residue, which is diluted to<br>
1 1 with water and extracted three times with 1 1 ethyl acetate. The organic phases are<br>
combined, dried over sodium sulfate and evaporated in vacua (40°C). The resulting extract<br>
(22.7 g) is thereafter subjected to preparative HPLC as described below (isolation).<br>
The mycelium is extracted three times with each 5 1 of acetone, and the acetone is<br>
evaporated in vacua (40°C) to yield an aqueous residue, which is diluted to 1 1 with water<br>
and extracted three times with 1 1 ethyl acetate. The organic phases are combined, dried i<br>
over sodium sulfate and evaporated in vacua (40°C). The resulting extract (13.4 g) is<br>
thereafter subjected to preparative HPLC as described below (isolation).<br>
4. Fermentation in other culture media (flask scale)<br>
Strain JS 360 is propagated in various other culture media in attempts to optimize<br>
production of example 1 and chemically related metabolites. For this purpose, shake flask<br>
fermentations are carried out in a similar manner as described for the one in Q6 medium<br>
(see 2. above). 1 1 Erlenmeyer flasks containing 150 ml of the media are thus propagated<br>
on a rotary shaker at 28°C and 240 rpm for up to 118 h. During fermentation, daily<br>
samples are taken. The pH is determined, and -free glucose is estimated using Bayer<br>
Diastix Hamzuckerstreifen. Aliquots of the culture broth (50 ml) are extracted with ethyl<br>
acetate. These ethyl acetate extracts are dried over sodium sulfate, evaporated to dryness,<br>
redissolved in methanol and analyzed using the HPLC-UV and HPLC-MS systems<br>
described in General Experimental Procedures. By comparison of retention times and<br>
spectra, example 1 and related compounds are detected in the following culture media:<br>
YM medium, C medium, GS medium, MC medium, MCPM medium, MS medium, and<br>
SP medium after 72-96 hours of fermentation. The highest yields of example 1, however,<br>
are observed in Q6 and GS media.<br>

Isolation of examples 1 to 7<br>
1. Materials-from shake flask fermentations<br>
The crude extracts (620 mg from the mycelium and 830 mg from the culture fluid,<br>
respectively) are dissolved in 5 ml of methanol, filtered through a Bond Elut CIS 500 mg<br>
solid phase extraction cartridge (Baker, Deventer, The Netherlands) and applied onto a<br>
MZ Analysentechnik (Mainz, Germany) Kromasil RP 18 column (particle size, 7 urn;<br>
250 x 40 mm). As mobile phase, a gradient of 0.01% TFA: acetonitrile is employed at a<br>
flow "of 10 ml/min:'20 % acetonitnl'e at t = 0 rain; linear gradient: 20% to 50% acetonitrile<br>
in 40 min; thereafter linear gradient from 50% to 100% acetonitrile in 20 min; thereafter<br>
isocratic conditions at 75% acetonitrile for 30 min, thereafter regeneration of the column.<br>
Fractions are combined according to UV adsorption at 210 nm. Example 1 is eluted at a<br>
retention time (R.t) of 80-83 min. and is obtained in amounts of 14 mg from the mycelial<br>
extract and 1.5 mg from the culture fluid extract, respectively. Examples 2 to 5 and 7 are<br>
located in minor intermediate fractions and not isolated to purity from this extract, while<br>
example 6 is not detected at all.<br>
2: Materials from 30 1 scale fermentation<br>
Aliquots of 2.5-3 grams of the crude extracts which are prepared as described above<br>
(13.4 g from mycelium, 22.7 g from culture fluid) are dissolved in 5 ml of methanol,<br>
filtered through a Bond Elut CIS 500 mg solid phase extraction cartridge (Baker,<br>
Deventer, The Netherlands) and applied onto a MZ Analysentechnik (Mainz, Germany)<br>
Kromasil KP 18 column (particle size, 7 um; 250 x 40 mm; mobile phase, 0.01% TFA:<br>
acetonitrile). As mobile phase, a gradient of 0.01% TFA: acetonitrile is employed at a flow<br>
of 10 ml/min: 20 % acetonitrile at t = 0 min; linear gradient: 20% to 50% acetonitrile in<br>
40 min; thereafter linear gradient from 50 % to 100% acetonitrile in 20 min; thereafter<br>
isocratic conditions at 75% acetonitrile for 30 min, thereafter regeneration of the column.<br>
Fractions are combined according to UV adsorption at 210 nm. Five bioactive intermediate<br>
products are thus obtained. Their retention times (Rt) in this gradient system are observed<br>
as follows: 61-64 min. for intermediate product 1 (containing example 4 and 7), 65-<br>
71 min. for intermediate product 2 (containing examples 5 and 6), 72-79 min. for intermediate<br>
product 3 (containing example 2), 79-85 min. for intermediate product 4<br>
(containing example 1) and 86-93 min. for intermediate product 5 (containing example 3).<br>
Final purification of active components in intermediate products 1 to 5 is obtained by<br>
preparative reversed phase HPLC, using a flow of 7 ml/min and a MZ Analysentechnik<br>
Inertsil CIS column (7 um; 250 x 30 mm) as stationary phase and the following gradient.<br>
Isocratic conditions from t = 0 min =&gt; t = 30 min; thereafter linear gradient from 30%<br>
acetonitrile .=&gt; 100% acetonitrile in 50 min, thereafter isocratic conditions (100% acetonitrile)<br>
for 20 min, thereafter regeneration of the column. Yields and Rt of examples 1 to 6<br>
are summarized in table LA general scheme for isolation is illustrated in Fig. 2.<br>

Characterization of example 1 to 7<br>
Example 1 to 6 are detected by HPLC-UV and HPLC-MS using the methods described in General<br>
Experimental Procedures. Their characteristics in analytical HPLC systems are summarized in<br>
table 2. The detection of example 1 in the employed gradients is illustrated in Fig. 3. While<br>
examples 1, 2, 4 and 7 give conclusive results regarding their molecular peaks, the LC-MS of<br>
example 3 only reveals the molecular peak in the positive ESI mode, while due to loss of carbon<br>
dioxide in the negative ESI mode, a smaller major mass fragment is observed. In examples 5 and<br>
'6, dimers are readily formed under the employed HPLC-MS conditions, and the major LC-MS<br>
signal thus relates to these dimers, while the molecular peaks only constitute minor signals. These<br>
characteristics also serve to identify the examples by analytical HPLC in fermentation broths and<br>
intermediate fractions obtained during extraction, downstream processing and chromatography.<br>
Table 2<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
The structures of examples 1 to 7 are determined by low-resolution and high-resolution LC-MS<br>
spectrometry and by one- and two-dimensional NMR (nuclear magnetic resonance) spectroscopy.<br>
For instrumental parameters see General Experimental Procedures.<br>
NMR data reveal the presence of a cz.s-dou.ble bond inside a cyclohexyl ring. The close analysis of<br>
HSQC, HMBC and COSY/TOCSY data allows to establish the bicyclic ring structure, which,<br>
together with the cyclohexenylcarbinol moiety, is identical to that found in Satinosporami^e A.<br>
HSQC data point toward the presence of at least two methyl groups in each molecule. Together<br>
with TOCSY and HMBC, a non-branched hexyl moiety is identified. An unambiguous crosspeak<br>
in the COSY spectrum locates this chain at the 2-position in the heterocyclic ring system.<br>
Examples 7 (as compared to example 1) and example 4 (as compared to example 2), are revealed<br>
by NMR and MS data to constitute the respective seco-foTms of the corresponding beta-lactone<br>
molecules. The presence of an additional hydroxyl group (compared to Salinbsporamide A) at the<br>
12-position (examples 2'and 4) becomes evident because of the multiplicity and the characteristic<br>
carbon and proton chemical shifts.<br>
The NMR spectra of examples 5 and 6 show a complete new subset of signals that belong to an Nacylated<br>
cysteine moiety. The N-acetyl-cysteine is linked to the heterocylic ring structure via the<br>
carbonyl group of the former beta lactone ring, or the carboxyl group of example 7, respectively.<br>
The thioester link is identified by its carbonyl chemical shift ( &gt; 200 ppm) and HMBC derived<br>
connectivity to the cysteine beta-hydrogens. All connectivities inside the cysteine residue are<br>
established by assigning the corresponding signals in HMBC and COSY spectra. Thus, the<br>
structures of examples 5 and 6 are analogous to that of lactacystin.<br>

Single crystal X-ray structure analysis of example 1 and determination of the absolute<br>
configuration<br>
Several crystals of example 1 are crystallized by slow evaporation of a saturated solution of<br>
propanol/diacetone alcohol 97:3 at 46°C. A fall data set is collected from a suitable crystal with<br>
the dimension 0.30 x 0.20 x 0.03 mm3 at -183.5°C using CuKct-radiation as X-ray source. A<br>
structure proposal is obtained in an orthorhombic cell using the chiral space group P2i2£i (see<br>
Fig. 7). The crystal cell has extreme large axes and contains 12 independent molecules of example<br>
1 with identical cbirality. All molecules show different conformations. The molecules are packed<br>
in polar and non polar layers (see Fig. 8). The single polar layers are connected two-dimensionally<br>
along hydrogen bondings. The absolute configuration of example 1 is thus determined with<br>
R(C2);S(C4);R(C5y,S(C6);S(C7) obtaining a Flack Parameter of 0.0 with a standard deviation of<br>
0.2 (H.-D. Flack, Acta Qyst., 1983, A39, 876-881). Expected values are 0 (within 3 esd's) for<br>
correct and +1 for inverted absolute structure.<br>
