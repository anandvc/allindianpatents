				<td>Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention refers to a composition for fixing wound items, in particular eiectrical windings in electrical equipment providing excellent impregnation properties into the wound items as well as extraordinarily good electrical insulation and thermal conductivity.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
The use of unsaturated polymers in compositions suitable for impregnating (e.g. by techniques of immersion, dipping, trickling or casting) wound items such as electrical coils and windings, especially windings of magnet wires in electrical devices as well as for casting of electrical devices such as stators, rotors and transformers, for mechanical toughening and fixing, is well known in the art. Various resins can be used for those applications, which typically provide electrical insulation, stabilization of the electrical winding against vibrations, improved aging behaviour and protection against chemical and mechanical impact. As downsizing of electrical devices is a more and more important topic for efficient motors, the improved thermal conductivity of the entire electrical device becomes an important property in this direction, and the impregnation composition is the key component for that.<br>
Insulation properties and thermal conductivity can be improved using inorganic fillers, like, for example, titanium dioxide, silica and aluminium. However, impregnation materials containing such fillers are typically not very homogeneous. This could cause problems regarding storage conditions of the composition and can additionally lead to failure of the penetration into the cavities of electrical windings as well as to failure of the impregnation during operation of the electrical device. DE-A 2638047 and WO 2007/045633 disclose the use of filler particles having a decreased size, but. homogeneity is still an issue. Also, the use of<br>
waterbome silica particles leads to non-favorable incorporation of water into the impregnation system and/or inorganic filler particles can lead to a significant increase in viscosity, which is not favourable for a good impregnation quality.<br>
It is known that inorganic fillers in wire enamels lead to increased life times of electrical devices, see for example WO 00/54286, US4760296. WO 00/54286 discloses organic-inorganic hybrid network compositions for electrical wires comprising reactive particles providing high mechanical and insulation properties under mechanical stress.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
The invention provides a composition for fixing wound items<br>
comprising<br>
A)	0 to 90 wt% of at least one a, 8 -unsaturated polyester and/or polyester imtde resin based on at least one unsaturated mono-, di-or tricarboxylic acids and/or mono-, di- or tricarboxylic acid group containing molecules, at least one polyol and/or, in case of an unsaturated polyester imide, at least one imide having 5-membered cyclic imide moieties,<br>
B)	0.1 to 80 wt% of at least one inorganic and/or organic-inorganic hybrid component having functionalities to react with component A) and C),<br>
C)	2 to 80 wt% of at least one monomeric and/or oligomeric unsaturated component to react with component A) and B), and<br>
D)	0 to 15 wt% of customary additives,<br>
the wt% being based on the total weight of the composition.<br>
The composition of the present invention provides excellent thermal transfer properties and a high level of electrical insulation properties with excellent adhesion and thermal stability. Surprisingly, excellent impregnation properties due to low viscosities even with a high level of inorganic matter could be achieved.<br>

Further additives may be fiber-like reinforcement agents like carbon, glass, polyamide, polyester, polyacrylnitrile, polyaramide, polyamideimide or polycarbonate fibers or fillers like chalk, talc, aluminium hydroxide, quartz flour, slate flour, clay or microdolomite; organic and inorganic pigments, dyes, thixotropy agents and shrinkage reducing agents. The amount of such additives in the composition is depending on the respective application, and is known at a person skilled in the art.<br>
The components A), B), C) and (D) may be mixed as readily prepared materials in any sequence. The components A), B) and/or D) may also be dissolved in (C) and afterwards mixed together. It is also possible to prepare components A) and B) in one step, e.g. by preparation of an unsaturated polyester in presence of a colloidal solution. This mixture may then be dissolved in C) and mixed with (D) or in a solution of D) in C).<br>
The use of the composition according to the invention may be proceed by processes known in the art, for example, by dip impregnation, vacuum impregnation or trickle impregnation. In the dip impregnation<br>
process, the substrates are dipped into the composition for a certain time or pulled through the composition. The substrate may be heated to temperatures below the curing temperature of the composition before dipping. In the vacuum impregnation process, the substrates are placed into a closed container, vacuum is applied, then the composition of the invention can be flushed into the container. In the trickle impregnation process, the composition according to this invention can be trickled with eg, a nozzle onto the rotating substrate.<br>
It can be useful to heat the substrate to temperatures below the curing temperature of the composition, for a good penetration. The heating may be provided by methods known in the art, for example, by electrical current or in an oven, for example, during or before impregnation application.<br>
After the impregnation application the composition according to this invention can be cured. This can be proceed, for example, by radical polymerization, and for this radical polymerization, it is useful to add radical initiators as part of component D) to the composition of the invention. The curing may be carried out by heating the impregnated substrate and/or by irradiation the impregnated substrate with high-energy radiation.<br>
The heat for curing can be produced, for example, by passing an electrical current through the windings; it is also possible to use an oven or an infrared (IR) or a near infrared radiation (NIR) source. The heating temperature (object temperature) may be in the range of 80 to 180°C. Typical curing times are, for example, 1 minute to 180 minutes, in case of NIR radiation the curing time may be shorter, for example, below 1 minute. The composition according to this invention can also be cured at low temperatures, under the use of additives such as aromatic amines or salts of cobalt, copper, cerium or vanadium.<br>
The coating according to this invention can also be cured by the application of high-energy radiation, e.g. ultraviolet (UV) light or electron<br>
beam. For UV curing, adequate initiators can be used, for example, photointtiators that absorb in a wavelength range of 190 to 450 nm.<br>
Also the combination of photoinittators with thermally labile initiators is possible, e.g. for a combination of heat curing and UV curing.<br>
The high-energy radiation may be used for the acceleration of the curing process, but also for the through-curing of the applied composition, depending on the impregnation layer thickness, UV- and electron beam radiation can also be used to cure only the surface of the impregnation composition of the invention applied on the substrate, in order to reduce emission of volatile monomers of the composition in a thermal curing step afterwards.<br>
Surprisingly, it is possible to add the composition according to this invention as additive material in amounts of 5 to 50 wt% to curable, polymerizable oligomers, polymers and copolymers which leads to an improvement of mechanical toughness, thermal transfer properties and electrical insulation.<br>
The composition according to this invention can be used in several fields of applications. They are especially useful for the fixing of wound items such as coiled substrates, especially of electrical windings like magnet wires in electrical devices like rotors, stators or transformers, or of coiled metal foils in the electrical sector, or coiled substrates on the basis of glass fibers, plastic fibers or plastic foils, and may also be used for the impregnation of fabrics.<br>
The invention will be described with reference to the following examples:<br>

Example 2<br>
Curing Process and Results<br>
Copper conductors were coated with the impregnating resin compositions at room temperature (20-22 °C) to yield a defined film thickness of 40µm. Curing was carried out at 160°C for one hour. The coated copper conductors were pressed together and connected to a frequency inverter. The coated copper conductors were then stressed with corona discharges (2.5 kV peak-to-peak, 20kHz). The time until breakdown of the insulating layers (short cut) was measured.<br>
