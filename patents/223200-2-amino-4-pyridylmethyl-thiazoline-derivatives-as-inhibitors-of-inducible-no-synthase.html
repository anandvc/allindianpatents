USE OF 2-AMINO-4-PYRIDYLMETHYL-THIAZOLINE DERIVATIVES AS INHIBITORS OF INDUCIBLE NO-SYNTHASE<br>
The present invention relates to the use of 2-amino-4-pyridylmethyl thiazoline derivatives of formula (I):<br><br>
The subject of the invention is the use of 2-amino-4-pyridylmethy] thiazoline derivatives of formula (I) and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof for the preparation of pharmaceutical compositions intended for preventing and treating diseases in which an abnormal production of nitric oxide (NO) by induction of inducible NO-synthase (NOS-2 or iNOS) is involved, the pharmaceutical compositions containing the novel 2-amino-4-pyridylmethyl-thiazoline derivatives and the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof and the novel 2-amino-4-pyridylmethyl-thiazoline derivatives and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof<br>
Nitric oxide (NO) is a diffusable radical involved in many physiological and pathological processes. It is synthesized by oxidation of L-Arginine, a reaction catalyzed by a family of enzymes known as nitric oxide synthases or NO-Synthases (NOSs), referenced in the international enzyme nomenclature under the number E.G. 1.14.13.39.<br>
Three NOS isoforms, two of which are constitutive and one inducible, are known:<br><br>
-	a neuronal NOS (NOS-1 or nNOS) was originally isolated and cloned from nerve tissue in which it is a constitutive enzyme. The NOS-1 produces NO in response to various physiological stimuli such as the activation of membrane receptors according to a mechanism dependent on calcium and on calmodulin.<br>
-	an inducible NOS (NOS-2 or iNOS) can be induced in response to immunological stimuli such as, for example, cytokines or bacterial antigens in various cells such as, for example, macrophages, endothelial cells, hepatocytes, glial cells, as well as many other types of cells. This isoform activity is not regulated by calcium. Consequently, once induced, it produces a large amount of NO over prolonged periods.<br>
-	an endothelial NOS (NOS-3 or eNOS) is constitutive and calcium/calmodulin dependent. It was originally identified in vascular endothelium cells, in which it generates NO in response to physiological stimuli such as the activation of membrane receptors.<br>
The NO produced by the neuronal endothelial constitutive isoforms (NOS-1 and NOS-3) is generally involved in intercellular signalling functions. For example, the endothelial cells which line the inner wall of blood vessels induce the relaxation of the underlying smooth muscle cells via the production of NO. It thus contributes towards regulating the arterial pressure.<br>
The NO produced in large amount by the inducible isoform NOS-2 is, inter alia, involved in the pathological phenomena associated with acute and chronic inflammatory processes in a large variety of tissues and organs.<br>
An excessive production of NO by induction of NOS-2 thus plays a part in degenerative pathologies of the nervous system such as, for example, multiple sclerosis, focal or global cerebral ischemia, cerebral or spinal trauma, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, Alzheimer's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, migraine, depression, schizophrenia, anxiety, epilepsy. Similarly, aside the central nervous system, the induction of NOS-2 is involved in many pathologies with inflammatory    components    such    as,    for   example,    diabetes,    atherosclerosis,<br><br>
myocarditis, arthritis, arthrosis, asthma, inflammatory bowel diseaese, Crohn's disease, peritonitis, gastroesophageal reflux, uveitis, Guillain-Barre syndrome, glomerulo-nephritis, lupus erythematosus and psoriasis. The NOS-2 was also involved in the growth of certain forms of tumors such as, for example, epitheliomas, adenocarcinomas or sarcomas, and in infections with Gram-positive or Gram-negative intracellular or extracellular bacteria.<br>
In all the situations in which an overproduction of NO is deleterious, it thus appears to be desirable to reduce the production of NO by administering substances capable of inhibiting the NOS-2. However, given the important physiological roles played by the constitutive isoform NOS-3, in particular, in regulating the arterial pressure, it is essential that the inhibition of the isoform NOS-2 has the least possible effect on the isoform NOS-3. Actually, it is known that the administration of unselective inhibitors of NOS isoforms leads to vasoconstriction and an increase in arterial pressure (Moncada, S., Palmer, R.M.J, and Higgs, E.A., Biosynthesis of nitric oxide from L-arginine: a pathway for the regulation of cell function and communication, Biochern. Pharmacol., 1989, 38: 1709-1715). These effects on the cardiovascular system are deleterious since they reduce the supply of nutrients to the tissues. Consequently, the present invention relates to compounds whose inhibitory activity with respect to NOS-2 is significantly higher than their inhibitory activity with respect toNOS-3.<br>
Thiazoline-based NOS inhibitors are described in particular in patent applications<br>
W094/12165, W095/11231 and W096/14842, but those of the present invention are<br>
neither disclosed not suggested by these documents, particularly with respect to the<br>
surprising special property of the compounds of the present invention as explained<br>
above.<br>

The compounds of formula (I) are isolated and can be purified by the commonly known methods, for example by crystallization, chromatography or extraction.<br>
The enantiomers of the compounds of formula (1) can be obtained by resolving the racemic mixtures, for example by chromatography on a chiral column according to PIRCKLE W. H. et al., Asymmetric Synthesis, vol. 1, Academic Press (1983) or by formation of salts or by synthesis from chiral precursors. The diastereoisomers can be prepared according to the known conventional methods (crystallization, chromatography or from chiral precursors).<br>
The compounds of formula (I) may optionally be converted into addition salts with an inorganic or organic acid by the action of such an acid in an organic solvent such as an alcohol, a ketone, an ether or a chlorinated solvent. These salts also form a part of the invention.<br>
Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable salts which may be mentioned are the following salts: benzenesulfonate, hydrobromide, hydrochloride, citrate, ethanesulfonate, fiimarate, gluconate, iodate, isethionate, maleate, methanesulfonate, methylenebis-/3-oxynaphtoate, nitrate, oxalate, pamoate, phosphate, salicylate, succinate, sulfate, tartrate, theophyllinacetate and p-toluenesulfonate.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) are inhibitors of NO-synthase inducible or NO-synthase of type 2 (NOS-2) and are thus useful for preventing and treating disorders<br><br>
associated with an excessive NO production such as mutiple sclerosis, focal or global cerebral ischemia, cerebral or spinal trauma, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, Alzheimer's disease, amiotrophic lateral scherosis, migraine, depression, schizophrenia, anxiety, epilepsy, diabetes, atherosclerosis, myocarditis, arthritis, arthrosis, asthma, inflammatory bowel disease, Crohn's disease, peritonitis, gastro¬esophageal reflux, uveitis, Guillain-Barre syndrome, glomerulo-nephritis, lupus erythematosus and psoriasis, the growth of certain forms of tumors such as for example epitheliomas, adenocarcinomas or sarcomas, and infections with Gram-positive or Gram-negative intracellular or extracellular bacteria.<br>
Their activities as inhibitors of NOS-2 and NOS-3 were determined by measuring the conversion of [Hj-L-arginine into ["Hj-L-citrulline with, respectively, a NOS-2 enzymatic fraction extracted from the lungs of rats or mice pretreated with lipopolysaccharides (10 mg/kg i.p. 6 hours before collecting the tissue) and with a commercial preparation of recombinant bovine NOS-3. The compounds were incubated for 20 to 30 minutes at 37 C in the presence of 5 |iM (for NOS-2 activity) or 10 M (for NOS-3 activity) of [H]-L-arginine, 1 mM of NADPH, 15 M of tetrabiopterine, 1M of FAD, 0.1 mM of DTT in a HEPES buffer (50 mM, pH 6.7) containing 10 ig/ml of calmoduline and 1.25 mM of CaCh when the NOS-3 activity was measured. The incubation was stopped by adding cold HEPES buffer (100 mM, pH 5.5) containing 10 mM EGTA and 500 mg of cationic ion-exchange resin (AG50W-X8, counter-ion : Na") to separate the [H]-L-aTginine from the [H]-L-citrulline. After separation of the phases by settling for 5 min, the radioactivity remaining in the Hquid phase was measured in a scintillation counter in the presence of a suitable scintillating liquid. The yield for the recovery of the formed L-[HJcitrulline was able to be estimated using L-[ureido-' C]-citrulline as external standard.<br>
The activity NOS-2 or NOS-3 %vas expressed in picomole(s) of [H]-L-citrulline formed per minute and per milligram of protein contained in the reaction medium.<br>
In this test on the enzyme NOS-2, the IC50 value for the compounds of formula (I) is less than or equal to 10 \iM.<br><br>
The selectivity is measured by the IC50 NOS-3 / IC50 NOS-2 ratio. This selectivity is greater than 45.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) are of low toxicity.   Their IC50 is greater than 40 mg/kg via cutaneous route in mice.<br>
The following example illustrates the invention in a non exhaustive manner. Example 1:<br>

A suspension of 0.4 g of //-(?erf-Aw/y/j-A'-[2-hydroxy-l-(3-methoxy-pyridin-4-yl-methyl)ethyl]-thiouTea in 4 mL of aqueous solution of 6N hydrochloric acid is heated at a temperature of about 100° C for 18 hours. The reaction medium is then concentrated under reduced pressure (2 kPa) at a temperature of about 40° C. The residue obtained is taken up by 25 mL of distilled water and the mixture is washed with 2 times 20 mL of dichloromethane. The aqueous phase is evaporated under reduced pressure (2 kPa) at a temperature of about 40° C. The residue is taken up with 2 times 15 mL of ethanol and concentrated according to the conditions described above, then dried in an oven under reduced pressure (10 kPa) at a temperature of about 40° C for 4 hours. About 0.31 g of racemic 4-(2-amino-4,5-dihydro-thiazoI-4-ylmethyl)-lH-pyridin-2-one hydrochloride, are obtained in the form of a pale yellow solid melting at 124° C. This product is purified by chromatography on a column of CHIRALCEL OD 20fi in an heptane-ethanol-triethylamine mixture (80/20/0.1 by volume). The fractions containing the expected product are collected and concentrated under reduced pressure (IkPa) at a temperature of about 40° C and then the residue is dried in an oven under reduced pressure (10 kPa) at a temperature of<br><br>

About 0.337 mL of fe/-butylisothiocyanate is added again and the reaction mixture is heated at a temperatue of about 60° C for 4 hours. After cooling, the reaction medium is concentred under reduced pressure (2 kPa) at a temperature of about de 40° C.
