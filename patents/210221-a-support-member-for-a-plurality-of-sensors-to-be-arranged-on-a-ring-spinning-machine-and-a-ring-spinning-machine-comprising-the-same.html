Sensor System for Ring Spinning IVIachine<br>
The present invention concerns a sensor system for a ring spinning machine, in particular one with a ring rail.<br>
The ring rail can be provided with a support member arranged transversely with respect to a ring take-up member which according to the DE-A-1 43 24 587.0 (Obj. No. 2338) takes up a rail which supports rings restraining the thread balloon. The ring rail furthermore can be provided with openings according to DE-A-195 42 802 (Obj. No. 2526). A design lay-out of this type is not relevant for the present invention but it serves for the explanation in the following of an example of practical application of a system according to the present invention.<br>
State of the Art<br>
An overview of the basic solutions known for the sensor systems on ring spinning machines is described in the article "Sensoren fur Fadenwwachter" (Sensors for thread detectors) in Textiltechnik 34 (1984) 3 (page 131). Certain solutions furthermore are known from the patent literature. In particular the following solutions are known which are based on, or at least indicate, application of contact-free scanning of the traveller movement, mostly using magnetic sensors:<br>
-	US-B-2'930'179; US-B-Z930'180 and US-B-3'102'378 -FR-A-r518'050<br>
-	DE-A-2'505'399 -EP-A-329'618<br>
-	CH-B-556'923 -JP-A-GM 6-83777<br>
-	DE-A-40 35 385.<br>
Other sensors proposed are e.g. vibration sensors (US 4'254'613), optical sensors (EP-A-480 898) and acoustic sensors (EP-A-442 327).<br><br>
Further documents concern scanning systems for checking the status of the many individual sensors on a ring spinning machine. Examples are JP-B-8-16287; DE-A-37 44 208; CH-B-684 908; and DE-A-40 11 944.<br>
The great number of sensors also causes additional problems, e.g. concerning circuit wiring and signal transmission. Certain solutions were described e.g. in DE-A-30 05 746; EP-A-389 849; DE-A-36 37 969 and DE-A-196 31 302.<br>
Some very few documents finally concern the problem of the arrangement on the ring spinning machine, such as e.g. JP-A-9-279426 and CH-B-671 040. No satisfactory solution, however, can be found in either document.<br>
The Present Invention<br>
The present invention mainly concerns the last mentioned problem, i.e. the arrangement of a great number of sensors on a ring spinning machine with a ring rail where the sensors are to move together with the ring rail in which arrangement the sensors are to scan the mode of movement of the travellers. It is the objective of the present invention to propose a solution which compared to the state of the art permits improved efficiency in mounting.<br>
The present invention thus provides a support member for a plurality of sensors to be mounted onto a ring spinning machine, characterized in that the support member comprises an elongated body with means for fastening the body to the ring rail laid out in such a manner that the body can extend over a longitudinal section of the machine corresponding to a plurality of spinning positions in which arrangement the body is laid out for fastening a corresponding number of sensors.<br>
The longitudinal section of the machine preferentially, however, does not correspond to the totality of all spinning positions on the corresponding machine side and thus a plurality of support members are to be fastened to the ring rail in such a manner that an individual sensor can be mounted co-ordinated to each spinning position of a machine side. The lengths of the bodies preferen-<br><br>
tially all are equal and after mounting they preferentially cover the front side of the ring rail from end to end.<br>
In cases in which a machine is laid out for the so-called sectional mounting (e.g. according to our patent application DE 197 55 780.5, filed December 16, 1997), the length of a body corresponds to the length of a machine section.<br>
The body preferentially is laid out as a profile and is e.g. substantially u-shap-ed in its cross-section. This body thus forms a duct for the wiring co-ordinated to the sensors. In the ring spinning machine neighbouring bodies can be arranged adjoining, or can be interconnected respectively, in such a manner that a continuous duct extending in the longitudinal direction is formed. To each of the bodies a cover can be co-ordinated in order to close the corresponding duct section. The cover also is composed of individual part elements in such a manner that an individual cover element can be co-ordinated to each duct section.<br>
The body preferentially is fastened to the front side of the ring rail. In case the body is laid out as a u-shaped profile the "bottom" portion of the profile can be fastened to the ring rail in such a manner that the two wall portions of the profile extend away from the ring rail.<br>
In the following examples of embodiments of the present invention are described with reference to the illustrations. It is shown in the:<br>
Fig. 1    a cross-sectional view of a ring rail and the surrounding parts of a ring spinning machine according to DE-A-195 42 802,<br>

Fig. 4   a simplified view seen in the direction of the arrow P according to the Fig. 3,<br>
Fig. 5   a schematic cross-sectional view of one side of a ring spinning machine , and in the<br>
Fig. 6   a schematic view of a sensor system which can be composed according to the concept of the present invention.<br>
First the design of the ring rail of a ring spinning machine is dealt with whereafter a design example of a support member according to the present invention is explained. Subsequently the sectional mounting of the ring spinning machine and the corresponding design lay-out of the support member and of the sensor system are discussed.<br>
The ring rail 110 according to the Fig. 2 comprises a horizontal support portion 113 for a ring 112 and towards the inside of the spinning machine a support part 111 whereon a rail 120 is fastened which supports a ring 124 for restraining the thread balloon. It is understood of course that to each spindle 116 with its spinning tube 118 in an opening 125 of the ring rail 110 a ring 112 each, a holder 122, and a further ring 124 are co-ordinated. A ring 112 is held in the ring rail by a holder ring 114. For guiding airflows openings 126 are provided in the support part 111 and strips 128 are arranged extending from the support part 111 below the support portion 113. The openings 126 permit draining of the air flowing along the spinning packages according to the arrows 140a, 140b. Such openings, however, are not relevant in the context of the present invention. If air guide means of this type in the form of the openings 126 and the strips 128 are used the number of ends down (or thread breakages) as well as fly contamination of the machine can be reduced substantially, however.<br>
The ring rail 150 according to the Figures 3 and 4 to a large extent corresponds to the ring rail 110 according to the Figures 1 and 2 the holders 122 and the air openings 126 being omitted. This ring rail 150 is provided with a<br><br>
support member comprising a base body 152 shaped as a U-shaped profile. The bottom portion of the profile is adapted to the front side 156 of the ring rail 150, i.e. in this case the surt'ace 158 of the profile bottom portion 154 facing the ring rail 150 is flat and the "width" of this surface 158 substantially corresponds to the height of the ring rail front side 156. The front side 156 of the ring rail as well as the surface 158 of the profile bottom 154 also could be laid out curved or with stepped edges the two cross-sections being mutually adapted.<br>
The support body 152 is provided with a lip 160 which during the mounting process rests against the surface 162 oriented upward of the ring rail 150 and thus determines the height position of the profiled body. The bottom portion 154 of the body 152 is provided with a groove 164 for taking up fastening means (not shown). These fastening means also extend through a bore 166 in the front side 156 using which the support body 152 is fastened to the ring rail 150. Positioning of the body 152 in the longitudinal direction is discussed in more detail in the following.<br>
The side opposite the bottom portion 154 of the profiled body 152 is open as such, but after mounting is closed using a cover 168. The cover 168 can be connected to the profiled body 152 using a snap-on connection (schematically indicated with the reference number 170). The cover 168 also serves as a support for certain electronic elements as described in more detail in the following. These parts thus are readily accessible after the cover is taken off for maintenance work.<br>
The wall 172 of the profiled body 152 oriented upward is provided with openings 174 serving for taking up fastening means 176 which fasten sensor holders 178 to the body 152. The holders 178 preferentially can be taken off individually and the connection of each holder to the support element should be easily detachable. A suitable connection can be established using a bayonet-type twist connection for which purpose the openings 174 can be laid out<br><br>
quadrangular (compare the Fig. 4). The details of the fastening means are not shown in the Figures as various possibilities are readily available to the expert in the field.<br>
The profiled body 152 can be made from synthetic material or can be extruded using a metal alloy. The extruded "endless" profile can be cut to predetermined lengths to form the individual bodies. The length of the various bodies will be discussed in the following in more detail. The cover can be formed from the same material, or from another one, using a similar manufacturing method. The preferred combination of materials comprises a profiled body made from aluminium alloy in combination with a cover made from synthetic material.<br>
In the spinning machine the openings 174 should be arranged in such a manner that the sensor (not shown) held in its holder 178 is positioned centred with respect to a ring 180 as can be seen from the Fig. 4; it is to be made clear that in the Fig. 4 for the sake of simplicity merely the inside rim 182 of the ring 180 and the outer rim of the ring holder 184 are shown specifically. The openings 174 must be cut out after extrusion of the body 152, neighbouring openings 174 being arranged at a predetermined distance from each other corresponding to the gauge of the spinning positions (ring axes) which is standardised in spinning machines. In mounting the profiled body 152 exact positioning of the whole body 152 in longitudinal direction of the ring rail must be ensured without special attention being paid to the individual holders 178. Positioning can be facilitated by rationally designing the fastening means between the profiled body 152 and the ring rail 150. The fastening means (not shown) can comprise e.g. clamping screws holding the body 152 against the ring rail 150 without precluding a shifting movement in the longitudinal direction in the groove 164 (i.e. in the longitudinal direction of the ring rail 150) before the screws are tightened completely. Only after the body 152 has reached its correct position in the longitudinal direction the clamping screws are tightened completely.<br><br>
The elements 186 shown in the Fig. 4 schematically represent fastening elements used for fastening the ring holders to the ring rail 150 whereas the element 188 represents a so-called traveller cleaner such as shown e.g. in DE-A-197 53 767. The traveller itself is indicated in the Fig. 4 with the reference number 190. The ring 180 shown in the Fig. 3 is laid out as a so-called "inclined flange ring" (e.g. according to EP-B-528 056). The present invention, however, can be applied, however, also with other ring types.<br>
The holder 178 is designed for taking up a magnetic sensor which reacts to the passages of the traveller 190 on the ring 180 during the spinning process. The design and the function of such sensors being well known to the expert in the field further details of the sensor are not discussed further here. The present invention as such is not limited to any specific type of sensor even if it obviously proves advantageous if a contact-free sensor type is chosen. Within the scope of the present invention it is important merely that the sensor must move together wit the ring rail which is ensured by fastening the sensor to the ring rail.<br>
Under certain circumstances it can be important that the position of a holder 178 (and of the sensor held therein, respectively) can be adapted in radial direction with respect to the ring 180, e.g. if a ring 180 of a given diameter is replaced by a ring of another diameter, as the distance of the sensor from the traveller in many cases (in particular if magnetic sensors are applied) is decisive for the function. A corresponding solution is shown schematically in the Fig. 3A (at an enlarged scale). The inner side of the wall 172 is provided with a plurality of grooves 200 (three in the case shown here) extending in the longitudinal direction. These grooves can be formed in the extrusion process at precisely predetermined positions relative to the contacting surface 158. A clamping element 202 of the fastening means for the holder 178 is provided with ribs 204 which can engage one or another of the grooves 202 in such a manner that a snap-on connection is obtained. The distance of the sensor (not shown) from the central axis of the ring 180 thus depends on which of the<br><br>
grooves 200 is engaged. In a position chosen (as shown in the Fig. 3A) the fastening arrangement of the holder can be in contact with one end of the opening 174, in another position chosen with the other end of the opening 174 and in a third position chosen the fastening arrangement can be placed freely between the ends of the opening. The clamping element 202 is to show the elasticity required for ensuring a rigid connection between the holder 174 and the body 152 without impairing the detachability of this connection.<br>
With reference to the Fig. 5 now the so-called sectional mounting procedure is to be explained for which purpose the data from our patent application DE 197 55 780.5, filed December 16, 1997, are relied on here.<br>
As a rule long spinning machines are subdivided in sections in such a manner that the mounting procedure can be effected at least partially in the manufacturing works and that on the other hand pre-assembled units can be joined without excessive effort during the final mounting procedure in the spinning mill. A concept of this nature is known e.g. from the German Patent Application DE 882 967. The spinning machine substantially is subdivided into longitudinal elements lined up coaxially, the longitudinal elements being interconnected mutually using transverse members (shields or frames). A machine section is to be substantially "self-supporting" i.e. it is to be mountable without the help of neighbouring machine sections. The general principle is shown in the Fig. 5. Accordingly a section of a ring spinning machine between two shields 12 (of which only one shield 12 is visible in the Fig. 5) comprises in its lower part a doffer support 34 with a doffer bearing 32 a guard rail 30 being arranged at the outer side of the doffer support. At the lower part of the shield a wiring duct 30a as well as a spindle rail part 26 are provided laterally mounted onto the shield 12.<br>
In the completely mounted state a plurality of spindles 40 (the number of which is not discussed here in detail) are placed lined up on the spindle rail 26. Furthermore holders 22 for guide rods 20 are fastened laterally on the shield 12<br><br>
which are movable vertically and guide a part of the ring rail 24 and a part of a thread guide rail 28. The longitudinal elements ring rail 24, thread guide rail 28 are connected via transverse cross members 20b, 20a with the guide rod 20.<br>
Of the two-sided machine the machine side left of the central plane M only is shown in the Fig. 5 schematically. In the upper part of the cross member or shield 12 a cylinder support rail is arranged which is designed as a longitudinal element also, supporting a further longitudinal element, namely the suction duct 32. Furthermore cylinder support members 16 are supported on the cylinder rail 14 supporting the drafting arrangement 18. In the drafting arrangement the drafting cylinders are contained as further longitudinal elements 18a using which drafting of the material of the yarn indicated with dashed lines is effected. On the upper part of the cylinder support member 16 a support member 40a is arranged for parts of the creel in which the material to be spun into yarn is stored.<br>
A long spinning machine can comprise one thousand spinning positions and more, each with one spindle 40 and a ring-traveller combination 24a, 24b as well as a drafting system position. The parts described together form a more or less complete (two-sided) section of a long spinning machine 10 of the type mentioned in which this section comprises a pre-determined number ("standardised" by the manufacturer) of spindles or spinning positions. A suitable number of spindles per section is e.g. forty-eight, i.e. twenty-four on each side of a two-sided section. The present invention is not limited, however, to this number of spindles which can differ from one manufacturer to the other.<br>
In a completely mounted spinning machine thus a large number (e.g. fifty or even more) of machine sections 11 are lined up in a row between a so-called head stock and a foot end unit (for the overall arrangement see e.g. the Fig. 1 in DE-A-39 35 901). The actual number of sections in a given machine depends on the requirements of the spinning mill where the machine is to be used, the maximum number of sections being limited due to problems stem-<br><br>
ming from the transmission of the drive forces, and of the suction air respectively, etc. from the head stock and the foot end unit. The concept of the support structure of a section thus provides at least two cross members 12 interconnected with longitudinal elements 30, 30', 26, etc., i.e. shields in which additional members thereof or of another machine section 11 such as the ring rail 24' with separators 25 and/or rails 42 are stored temporarily for shipment in the machine section described. In the spinning mill the partially assembled sections are completed with the individual elements in such a manner that a machine of the length ordered (number of spindles and derived therefrom, the number of machine sections) is obtained.<br>
From the above explanations two findings are apparent without further descriptions, namely that:<br>
-	on one hand a ring rail 150 (Fig. 3) according to the concept of the sectional mounting is built up from a plurality of longitudinal part elements where the length of the part element substantially equals the length of a machine section, and that<br>
-	on the other hand the length of the profiled body 152 (Fig. 3) preferentially is adapted to the length of the machine section in such a manner that each profiled body 152 can be co-ordinated to a corresponding ring rail part element.<br>
From this it is clear that the number of holders 178 per profiled body 152 is to be equal to the number of rings 180 contained in the corresponding ring rail part element where this number depends on the mounting concept applied by the machine manufacturer. It also will be clear that the present invention is not restricted to the equality of the lengths of the profiled bodies and of the machine section lengths of a given machine. It also would be possible to apply two or more different profiled bodies on each side of the machine. It also would be feasible to supply each profiled body in a standardised length which is not<br><br>
adapted to any particular machine section concept in which case every profiled body is to be cut to suitable length for adapting it to the given situation.<br>
With reference to the Fig. 6 the general concept of the sensor system of the machine is described in more detail in the following before the above mentioned electronic elements arranged in each section are dealt with. It is assumed that each machine section is equipped with its own micro computer which processes the output signals of the sensors co-ordinated to this machine section. Each of the section computers communicates with a central unit in which arrangement the connections with this central unit may differ depending on the general concept applied.<br>
In the Fig. 6 thus fifty machine section units S1 through S50 are indicated schematically which are connected to an adapter via a bus circuit, and further details of an individual unit S25 are shown as an example for all the other units all units S1 through S50 being equal. The unit S25 comprises a computer chip (printed circuit board) PCB as well as individual circuits L1 through L24 between the input/output ports on this chip and the individual connecting elements V1 through V24. These connecting elements V1 through V24 are designed, and fastened relative to the openings 174 (Fig. 3), in such a manner that as a holder 178 is placed into its take-up opening 174 the signal input and output ports of the sensor supported by his holder are automatically (without further manipulation) connected to the chip PCB via the corresponding circuit Lx. The chip PCB also is provided with main signal input and output means for connection to the bus circuit. The bus circuit can be laid out as a so-called Ethernet bus circuit, the present invention not being restricted to a particular type bus circuit. Finally each computer PCB is connected with a signal lamp SL co-ordinated to it. The purpose of this signal lamp is to be explained in more detail in the following.<br>
The adapter A itself is not necessarily to be equipped with a computer. It serves for connecting the bus circuit with other control units, in particular with<br><br>
the machine control unit, or with the energy supply M of the machine and with a central unit ZE which processes the data supplied by the sensors. The central unit ZE in turn can be connected to a data storage and process control system SW, e.g. with a system supplied by the applicant company under the name "Spiderweb". This connection, however, is not dealt with in more detail here as is not concerned directly within the context of the present invention. All connections preferentially are laid out for bilateral communication, however.<br>
The arrangement shown in the Fig. 6 is based on two "prevailing conditions", namely that:<br>
-	the sensor system to be applied to the spinning machine can not be tied into the wiring of the machine, or that the central unit ZE can not be integrated directly into the machine control system, and that<br>
-	sensor system not necessarily is to be connected with a sliver stop function (e.g. according to DE-A-35 26 305). The present invention, however, is not restricted to applications within these prevailing conditions, i.e. it can be realised alternatively in the framework of a system according to EP-B-389 849.<br>
It thus is not necessary that a central unit be provided for each machine, i.e. the adapters A of a plurality of spinning machines can be connected to a common central unit ZE. For the sake of simplicity it is assumed in the further description that every machine be equipped with its own central unit ZE (Fig. 6) and that this central unit is coping with tasks pertinent to the ends down sensor system merely (no machine control functions). The central unit in any case has no direct connection to the individual sensors supported in their holders 178 but only via the bus circuit to the sectional computer PCB. Each of the sectional computers thus is laid out for scanning the sensors co-ordinated to it for their actual status (multiplexor function) and for transmitting the corresponding information to the central unit upon request by the latter. The type of the information to be transmitted is described in more detail in the following<br><br>
after the explanation of the arrangement of the electronic elements in each section with reference to the Figures 3 and 4.<br>
The chip PCB in each machine section is arranged in the cover 168 of the profiled body 152 co-ordinated to this machine section. The circuit Lx (compare the Fig. 6, not shown in the Fig. 3) for a sensor extends from the chip PCB in the direction of the opening 174 using which the sensor holder 178 is to be fastened to the body 152. This circuit can be provided with a fast connecting means (not shown) in such a manner that it can be easily connected to a circuit connected to the sensor for the signal transmission. The main input and output ports (HS, Fig. 6) can be connected with the input and output ports of the neighbouring chips while the support members are mounted. The profiled bodies 152 with their covers 168 thus form a cable or wiring duct protecting the electronic elements and their connecting circuits.<br>
In principle it is possible, with the help of the sensors known today and reacting to the traveller movement, to obtain two information indications concerning a spinning position, namely:<br>
a)	thread is being wound on, or is not being wound, and<br>
b)	the spindle rotational speed.<br>
In the case a) the chip PCB based o the sensor output signal determines whether the traveller periodically travels past the sensor (thread being wound) or not (no thread being wound). In the case b) the Chip PCB additionally must determine the number of traveller passages over a given time period. The chip preferentially also is capable of detecting defective sensors.<br>
The chip PCB thus locally stores and processes the output signals transmitted by the sensors co-ordinated to it. If no defects are detected, no "incident telegrams" are to be transmitted to the central unit ZE. The following disorders, however, must be reported using such telegrams:<br><br>
1)	an end down is detected,<br>
2)	spindle speed outside the given tolerances,<br>
3)	defective sensor.<br>
At the same time the signal lamp SL (Fig. 6) co-ordinated to this machine section is to be lit in order to signal to the operator in which section the defect has occurred. It would be advantageous to provide the defect signals with a spindle identification (e.g. number) and possibly with a "time tag". But also on the basis of signals per machine section (without time tag) the central unit, or the data handling unit SW is able to evaluate the operational behaviour of the spinning machine and to display it in such a manner that the operating personnel can take action. If no time tag can be reported with the information an incident preferentially is signalled "immediately" using a "telegram" to the central unit where the time moment of the report transmission can be scanned and stored.<br>
It can be of particular interest if information can be obtained covering particular time periods, e.g. the number of ends down during the star-up of the machine after a doffing process ("start-up ends down). In order to render this feasible and also in order to avoid mis-interpretations during standstill periods, during start-up and during completion of a spinning cycle the chips PCB must be informed by the central unit ZE as to the actual operating mode of the machine, or must be given orders, respectively, which start and/or suppress certain processing steps in the chips.<br>
The various functions thus can be summarised as follows:<br>
The machine section:<br>
-	receives from the central unit during initialisation the parameters:<br>
-	minimum rotational speed (tread running)<br>
-	the time interval to be applied in detecting so-called "crawling spindles".<br>
-	determines, based on the signals for the correctly running spindles, an aver<br>
age rotational speed within the machine section<br><br>
-	determines a status summary for the spindles co-ordinated to it concerning<br>
-	end(s) down occurred<br>
-	crawling spindle(s) present<br>
-	sensor(s) defective<br><br>
-	periodically receives from the central unit ZE a rotational speed value for detecting the crawling spindles. Spindles (or travellers, respectively) running at a speed lower than the predetermined rotational speed over a time period exceeding the predetermined crawler time interval are detected as crawling spindles.<br>
-	cyclically determines during operation the spinning position status and if required switches on the signal lamp SL when an incident telegram is transmitted to the central unit ZE.<br>
-	determines during the start-up phase and/or the doffing phase the number of ends down. Information on ends down occurring during these phases must be stored in the machine section and are to be transmitted in a special message upon request signalled by the central unit (after completion of the special phase). During such phases normally the spindle rotational speed is not scanned as it is changing continually. The start, and the end respectively, of such phases is signalled by the central unit.<br>
The adapter:<br>
-	transmits the signals from the machine sections<br>
-	transmits a signal indicating whether the machine is running or not<br>
-	transmits a doff phase signal.<br>
The central unit (if not mentioned earlier already):<br>
-	summarises data per spindle (e.g. per shift)<br>
-	periodically determines, based on the section rotational speeds, the limit rotational speed for determining the crawler spindles and transmits this limit rotational speed value to the machine sections.<br><br><br><br>
