				<td>NON-HOMOGENEOUS SYSTEMS FOR THE<br>
RESOLUTION OF ENANTIOMERIC MIXTURES<br><br><br>
TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br><br>
The present invention relates to a process for the biocatalyst—mediated enantioselective conversion of enantiomeric mixtures of hydrophobic esters using a biphasic solvent system. More particularly, the present invention relates to the enzyme—mediated enantioselective synthesis of anti— viral compounds, such as 2-hydroxymethyl-5— (5-fluorocytosin—l—yl) —1, 3—oxathiolane (FTC) and its analogues, in a non-homogenous reaction system.<br><br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br><br>
Serious obstacles to commercially viable processes for the enzymatic resolution of enantiomeric mixtures of hydrophobic esters exist. For example, when using an enzymatic conversion process in the presence of an organic solvent, the rate of enzyme inactivation is very high relative to the same process performed in an aqueous solvent. A confounding problem is that solvents which are less destructive to the catalyst are often less able to solubilize the more hydrophobic substrates. Ideally, nany processes would<br><br>
be more efficient if they were performed in more hydrophobic solvents, such as non—miscible organic solvents. One goal of the present invention is to provide a non-homogenous system, which allows higher concentrations of hydrophobic substrates to be converted to product, while simultaneously consuming less catalyst.<br><br>
The above—cited obstacles must be overcome i.n order to reduce the cost of producing enantiomeric drugs anti-viral drugs. Such drugs are vital towards winning the struggle to conquering emerging viral diseases. For example, even today, the rate of HIV infection continues at a staggering pace, with 16,000 new infections per day worldwide (Balter, M. Science 280, 1863—1864 (1998)]. There are areas of sub-Saharan Africa where at least 25% of the population are infected, for example in Botswana and Zimbabwe. The cost of anti—viral drugs, however, is currently far beyond the reach of most such victims of HIV infection.<br><br>
Nucleoside analogues, such as 3'— thiaribofuranonsyl—f3.—cytosine ("3-TC"), 3' -aziao-3 -deoxythymidine (AZT) (Blair E., Darby, G., Gough, E., Littler, D., Rowlands, D., Tisdale, M. Antiv~ira1 Therapy, BIOS Scientific Publishers Limited, 1998],<br><br>
3'-dideoxy-5—fluoro-3'--thiacytidine ("FTC") and<br><br>
2' , 3' —dideoxy—3'—thiacytidine are important ant iviral agents [Liotta, D.C. 216th ACS National Meeting, Medicinal Chemistry Abstract, Boston, MA, August 2327, 1998; Hoong, L.K., Strange, L.E., Liotta, D.C., Xoszalka, G.W., Burns, C.L., and Schanazi, R. F., J. Org. Chem. 1992, 57, 5563-5565]. 3-TC has been marketed as both an anti-HIV and an anti-HBV drug and FTC is under clinical trial for evaluation as an anti<br>
viral drug tLiotta, D.C., Schinazi, R.F., and Choi, W.B., United States patents 5,210,085, 5,700,937 and 5,824,639]. Since it is the (-)enantiomer of both (-<br>
-FTC and (-)—2', 3' -dideoxy-3' -thiacytidine, which exhibits the most potent anti—viral activity and the least toxicity, as compared to the corresponding (+)— isomers, there is a pressing need for efficient cost-effective methods of preparation of both the (-)—FTC and (-)-2',3'—dideoxy-3'—thiaoytidine isomers to expand treatment options of patients throughout the world [Liotta, D.C. 216th ACS National Meeting, Medicinal Chemistry Abstract, Boston, MA, August 23—27, 1998; Hoong, L.K., Strange, L.E., Liotta, D.C., Koszalka, G.W., Burns, C.L., and Schinazi, R.F., J. Org. Chem. 1992, 57, 5563—55651.<br><br>
Many hydrolase enzymes have been used for the resolution of FTC esters (Hoong, L.K., Strange, L.E., Liotta, D.C., Koszalka, G.W., Burns, C.L., and Schinazi, R. F., J. Org. Chem. 1992, 57, 5563—5565]. Impediments remain, however, to developing practical enzyme mediated chemical processes for the production of FTC and si.niilar compounds. First, the solubility of many FTC esters in aqueous media is too low to achieve economically viable production of resolved product. One possible solution has been to add a water miscible co-organic solvent to increase the concentration of the ester in solution. An example is the use of solutions of acetonitrile and water (Hoong, L.K., Strange, L.E., Liotta, D.C., Koszalka, G.W., Burns, C.L., and Schinazi, R.F., J. Org. Chem. 1992, 57, 5563—5565; Liotta et al., United States patent 5,827,727]. Although the use of a water miscible organic solvent and water solution increases the concentration of<br><br>
substrate in solution, it has the unfortunate effect of drastically lowering the enzyme catalyzed conversion and enzyme stability. This problem is especially pronounced, where the substrate is not completely dissolved, but is also present as an undissolved solid suspension (high concentration of substrate loading). Similar results were obtained in our laboratory. When water miscible organic solvents, such as isopropanol, dimethylforinamide (DMF), 1-metbyl-2-pyrrolidinone, dimethylsulfoxide (DM50), methanol, acetonitrile, ethanol, 1-propanol were used as co—solvent for the resolution, the maximal substrate concentration loading was 3%. The presence of undissolved substrate decreased the enantioselectivity when the substrate concentration was beyond 3%. Furthermore, use of a water miscible organic solvent and water solution, at concentrations of water miscible organic co—solvents of greater than 20%, had a pronounced negative impact on enzyme activity, especially for porcine liver esterase<br>
(PLE).<br><br>
The present invention specifically addresses several obstacles in the art that had the effect of making enzymatic resolution of enantiomeric mixtures uneconomical. First, it was thought that enzymatic conversion should be performed under homogenous conditions, because biphasic systems result in poor reproducibility (See Liotta et al., United States patents 5,827,727, 5,892,025, 5,914,331]. One potential advantage for the use of non—homogenous systems would be in enhanced solubilization of the substrate. Presumably, in a non-homogenous system, a higher concentration of many hydrophobic substrates could be accommodated. Prior to the present invention, it was believed that alcohol solvents should be<br>
avoided, because these solvents denature enzymes [Liotta et al., United States patents 5,827,727, 5,892,025, 5,914,331]. The present invention is an advance over the art because it specifically provides for the use of alcohol solvents which form nonhomogenous systems with water. In addition, the use of non—homogenous solvent systems provides increased solubilization of more hydrophobic substrates than could be accomodated previously in the art. Furthermore, the present invention discloses a process which requires less enzyme per unit of product.<br><br>
Additional improvements achieved via the present invention permit the use of several alcohol solvents in an enzymatic process. In addition, the present invention provides an alternative process mode, wherein enzyme and organic solvent requirements are further reduced by the addition of surfactants. Finally, the present invention is directed to providing a more efficient enzymatic process which maintains the enantioselectivity at a high level.<br><br><br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br><br>
Figure 1 depicts the enantioselective conversion of one enantiomeric form of an enantiomeric mixture of FTC butyrate to the corresponding nonracemic alcohol and the desired non-racemic ester.<br><br><br>
SUMMAARY OF THE INVENTION<br><br>
The present invention is directed to several improvements in processes for producing a chiral, non— racemic ester. More specifically, the present invention is directed to providing an improved process<br><br>
that uses a biphasic non-homogenous system employing biocatalysts to resolve enantiomeric mixtures of FTC esters and analogues of FTC esters. The invention is further directed to improvements which allow high substrate loading and consume reduced amounts of enzyme.<br><br>
A first improved process according to this invention provides for dispersing an enantiomeric mixture of an ester in an organic solvent system to produce an organic component at a high substrate loading. An aqueous component is provided and preferentially contains a dispersed hydrolase enzyme. Alternatively, the hydrolase enzyme can be added to the entire non—homogenous system or less preferentially to the organic component. The process further requires contacting the organic component and the aqueous component to form a non-homogenous system, under conditions which permit the resolution of the mixture to produce a chiral non—racemic ester and a non-racemic alcohol. The combination of the organic component and aqueous component form a non-homogenous system. By using a non—homogenous system, much higher substrate concentrations are possible. In one embodiment, after the reaction is carried out, the chiral non-racemic ester compound may be isolated from the organic component and the chiral non—racemic alcohol compound may be isolated from the aqueous component. The isolation steps may vary, depending on the particular compound and conditions.<br><br>
This invention also provides an alternative process that produces improved results by drastically reducing the amount of enzyme required for producing a given product. Such improvement is achieved by the addition of surf actant to said non—homogenous system, <br>
To produce an improved non-homogenous system that requires less organic solvent to solubilize the substrate.<br>
In anoter embodiment, the invention provides a process using a lowered organic/water phase ratio, which results in a further reduction in the required hydrolase enzyme.<br>
In another embodiment of this invention, addition of surfactant to the system permits enhancement of enzyme reaction rates and better solubilization of substrate. Higher rates of reaction result in a lower overall enzyme costs for operating the process.<br>

The reaction scheme for resolution of an enantiomeric mixture is illustrated in the reaction shown in Figure 1 (infra), where the substrates were either, acetate, formate, propionate, butyrate, pentanoate or other n-alkyl and branched chain or aryl esters of FTC, or derivatives of such esters of FTC and the organic co-solvents were any that werenot more than about 50% water miscible alcoholic, alkane, aromatic, ketone ether, nitro, halo—alkane or aromatic organic solvents, such as n-amyl alcohol, iso-amyl alcohol, tert-amyl alcohol, 3-pentanol, 1- or 3-heptanol, 3-methyl—3-pentanol, 4-methyl-2-pentanol, 3—ethyl-3-pentanol, 1- or 2-butanol, nitromethane, dichloromethane, methyl isobutyi ketone, dimethyl sulfide, sulfolane, and others.<br><br><br>

In one example, when X is Fluorine, R is C3H7 and Y is Sulfur, then compound A represents an enantioiaeric mixture of FTC butyrate. Various hydrolytic enzymes such as, porcine liver esterase (PLE), lipase from Pseudomonas species (PSL) and lipase from Aspergillus niger (A2~L) have been used as catalyst f For PLE catalyzed reactions in mixed organic solvents: See Ariente—Fliche, C., Braun, J., and Le Goffic, F., Synth.

The biocatalysts may be either soluble enzyme, izmuobilized enzyme or crosslinked crystal (CLEC~') form of the enzyme (Altus Biologics, Inc., Cambridge, Massachusetts) . The reaction can be performed in a batch reactor, a column, a hollow—fiber membrane [Enzyme Catalysis in Organic Synthesis, pp. 138—150, edited by Drauz, K. and Waldmann, H., VCH Verlagsgesellschaft GzubH, Weinheim, 1995] or membrane reactor [Dodds, D.R., Lopez., J.L., Zepp, C.N., and Rossi, P..F. PCT Patent Application No. WO 90/04643. Nay, 1990].<br><br>
The choice of which particular enzyme is best for a given substrate pair is determined by treating samples of the enantiomeric pairs with various enzymes such as porcine liver esterase, porcine pancreatic lipase, lipases from Pseudomonas species (PSL) and lipase from Aspergillus niger (ANL), and proteases such as subtilisin or ~-chymotrypsin. After treatment of the enantioneric mixture with the resolving enzyme, the products are isolated using standard extraction or chromatography procedures. The enzyme producing the greatest enantiomeric excess of the desired product should be the best candidate for use in the process.<br>
The process can be further improved by choosing a given enantiomeric mixture and resolving enzyme combination and determining the ideal solvent conditions for the reaction. In a biphasic system, the choice of organic solvent must be determined. The optimum organic solvent can be determined by treating samples of the enantiomeric mixture with the selected enzyme in the presence of the same amount of an array of not more than about 50% water miscible organic solvents. Particular solvents include any not more than about 50% water miscible (solubility less than 50% in water at room temperature) alcoholic, alkane, aromatic, ketone ether, nitro, halo—alkane or aromatic organic solvents, such .as n-amyl alcohol, iso—amyl alcohol, tert-amyl alcohol, 3-pentanol, 1- or 3-heptanol, 3-methyl-3-pentanol, 4-inethyl—2-pentanol, 3-ethyl—3—pentanol, 1- or 2—butanol, nitromethane, dichloromethane, methyl isobutyl ketone, dimethyl sulfide, sulfolane, etc. Following treatment of an enantiomeric mixture with the resolving enzyme in the presence of equal amounts of var:ous solvents, the products are isolated using standard extraction or chromatography procedures. The solvent/enzyme pair producing the greatest enantiomeric excess of the desired product should be the best candidate for use in the process.<br><br>
The relative quantity of the selected organic solvent should also be evaluated in order to achieve the best results. To do this, a similar procedure as described above is followed. Using a particular enzyme/racemic mixture, the ratio of the selected organic solvent/aqueous sclvent is varied in a manner such as the following: 95:5, 90:10, 80:20, 70:30, 60:40, 50:50, 40:60, 3C:70, 20:80, 20:90 and 5:95,<br>
([organic solvent]: [aqueous solvent]) . Identical samples of an enantiomeric mixture are treated with a standard amount of a particular enzyme in the presence of varying ratios of organic solvent to aqueous solvent for a set time. The total volume is kept constant. Following treatment of an enantiomeric mixture with the resolving enzyme in the presence of equal amounts of various solvents, the products are isolated using standard extraction or chromatography procedures. The solvent system/enzyme pair producing the greatest enantiomeric excess of the desired product should be the best candidate for use in the process.<br><br>
Alternatively, for sone racemic mixture:enzyme: organic solvent combinations, enzyme activity may be enhanced and organic solvent levels reduced by adding surfactants to the reaction. In order to evaluate whether a surfactant shoud be added to a particular process. Some variation of the following process may be pursued. First, a surfactan:<br><br>
is selected by treating samples o~ an enantiomeric mixture with the selected enzyne and an array of surfactants in the presence of a non—honogeneous system composed of a not more than about 50% water miscible organic solvent and an aqueous solvent. The system should be one which is compatible wirn carrying out the reaction in the absence of a surfactant. Examples of surfactants include the Tweens, such as Tween 20 TM, Tween 80TM, Frionex TM, Teepol HB7~", Tergitol TMN-6~', Tergitol TNN- 10 TM, Tergitol NP-4 TM, Tergitol 15—S- 3 TM, Igepal CA-630 TM, TyloxapoP", Glucode-oxycholic acid, octyl )ß-gluco—pyranoside, CHAPS TM, dioctyl sulfosuccinate, or deoxycholic ac.d. Following treatment of an enantiomeric mixture with the resolving enzyme in the presence of a biphasir solvent systen and <br>
a constant amount of various surfactants, the products are isolated. using standard extraction or chromatography procedures. The solvent/enzyme! surfactant combination producing the greatest enantiomeric excess of the desired product in a set time should be the best candidate for use in the process.<br><br>
The surfactant may be added at a concentration or range of concentrations depending on how many samples can be processed at one time. For a given solvent/enzyme! surfactant combination, the optimal surfactant concentration should be determined. One of skill in the art will appreciate that an array of independent reactions should be set up, differing only by the concentration of surfactant. For example, the reaction may be carried out using PLE in 20% pentanol and 80% Tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane or [2-amino-2-(hydroxymethyl)-l,3-propanediol buffer at pH<br><br>
7.4.	Ten identical reactions may be set up, having the following surfactant concentrations: 1%, 3%, 5%, 7.5% 10%, 12.5%, 15%, 20%, 25% and 30%. Following treatment of an enantiomeric mixture with the resolving enzyme in the presence of a biphasic solvent system and increasing surfactant concentration for a set time, the products are isolated using standard extraction or chromatography procedures. The solvent/enzyme! surfactant combination producing the greatest enantiomeric excess of the desired product in a set time should be the best candidate for use in the process.<br><br>
Surfactants useful for carrying out this invention include cationic, anionic, non-ionic or amphoteric, or mixtures thereof. The preferred surfactant will depend upon the particular enzyme<br>
and/or substrate components. Such screening procedures are well known to those of skill in the art. Illustrative screening processes are set forth in Examples 24-30.<br><br>

After selecting a suitable surfactant, the ratio of organic solvent may sometimes be reduced significantly without losing product yield or enantioslectivity. One of skill in the art will appreciate that one such procedure for determining how much to lower the organic solvent is as follows: Using a particular enzyme/racemic mixture/surfactant<br>
combination the ratio of the selected organic solvent to aqueous solvent is varied as follows: [% organic solvent: % aqueous solvent], 95:5, 90:10, 80:20, 70:30, 60:40, 50:50, 40:60, 30:70, 20:80, 10:90 and 5:95, and other ratios as required. Samples of an enantiomeric mixture are treated with a standard amount of a particular enzyme in the presence of varying ratios of organic solvent to aqueous solvent and surfactant for a set time. Following treatment of an enantiomeric mixture with the resolving enzyme in the presence of equal amounts of various solvents, the products are isolated using standard extraction or chromatography procedures. The solvent/enzyme pair producing the greatest enantionteric excess of the desired product should be the best candidate for use in the process.<br><br><br>
An additional consideration for carrying out the process of the present invention is the cost of the enzyme per unit of product produced. The present invention is directed to reducing the enzyme requirements of the process on a per unit of product basis. In one embodiment1 the amount of organic component is reduced in the non-homogeneous system. In another embodiment, a surfactant is added to the nonhomogeneous system to further reduce the amount of enzyme required and further reduce the cost of operating the process.<br><br>
The present invention is particularly directed to enzyme reactions wherein the substrate comprises a hydrophobic ester. The present invention is additionally directed to enzyme reactions wherein the substrate is relatively insoluble in aqueous solutions. The use of a non-homogeneous system having incompletely water miscible organic co—solvents<br><br>
provides improved solvation for hydrophobic esters and other hydrophobic and insoluble compounds as compared to systems using water miscible organic solvents.<br><br>
In order that this invention may be better understood, the following examples are set forth. These examples are for the purpose of illustration only and are not to be construed as limiting the scope of the invention in any matter.<br><br>
Example 1, Porcine Liver Euterase Catalyzed Resolution<br><br>
of FTC butyrate<br><br>
Racemic FTC-butyrate (1.0 g) was dissolved in 5.0<br><br>
ml of n-amyl alcohol by heating to 75 0C for 30 minutes to make an organic component. The organic component was then mixed with an aqueous component comprising 3.8 ml of 0.3 N pH 7.5 phosphate buffer and the nonhomogeneous system was allowed to cool to 35 ~C. Porcine liver esterase solution, 1.2 ml of 650 U/ml Altus PLE solution (Altus Biologics, Cambridge, MA) was then added to the aqueous layer and the resulting suspension was stirred with gentle agitation. The temperature was maintained at 32 C by an external water—bath. The pH was maintained at 7.5 by the addition of 50% aqueous sodium hydroxide as necessary. The optical purity of the unreacted (-)-butyrate ester and the (4)-FTC alcohol product were monitored by HPLC analysis using a chiral stationary phase column. After 24 hours, the (+)-enantiomer of the FTC ester was completely converted based on HPLC analysis as described below. Extraction of the unreacted ester from the organic phase and evaporation of the organic solvent gave the desired (-)—FTC ester. The recovered yield was 89.4 % based on the single (-) enantiomer and the optical purity was greater than 99 %.<br><br>
Chiral HPLC conditions : CHIRAPAK~ AS; 0.46 cm x 25 cm HPLC column (Daicel Chemical Inc.), mobile phase = 100 % acetonitrile, flow rate = I ml/min., uv detection at 260 rim. Retention times: (-)-FTC butyrate, 6.2 nan.; (-)-FTC, 7.4 mm.; (+)-FTC butyrate, 8.8 mm.; and (+)—FTC, 11.4 mm.<br><br><br>
Enzyme activity was determined by the conversion of ethyl butyrate using a Radiometer pH—stat apparatus to follow the production of acid. Ethyl butyrate (40 ml) was added to 20 ml of 5 mM boric acid (pH 8) and stirred at 25C until dissolution was complete (10 minutes). PLE was added and the pH was maintained at 8.0 by the addition of 0.01 N NaOH. The rate of acid production was determined from the rate of base addition over a period of 5 minutes.<br><br>
Enz~e stability was measured while the reaction was in progress. Measurements were performed by periodically removing aliquots of the enzyme solution and determining the activity using the ethyl butyrate assay.<br><br><br>
Example 2, CLECaI~PLE catalyzed reaction of FTC butyrate in 83% of m-amyl alcohol (or 3-Me-3-pentanol) /aqueous mixture<br><br>
The reaction conditions and procedures were the same as in Example 1, except the volume of phosphate buffer was 1 ml and the volume of the organic component was 8.3 ml. The conversion was 38% for n— amyl alcohol and 25% for 3—methyl—3—pentanol after 36 h (see Table 1, Reactions 12 and 13)<br><br><br>
Example 3, PSL-catalyzed reaction of FTC butyrat. in<br><br>
50% ri-amyl alcohol/aqueous mixture<br><br>
The reaction conditions and procedures were the same as in Example 1, except that 100 mg of soluble PSL—30 (PSL-30 is £'S30 from Amano) was used. The conversion was 56% after 24 h and the (-)-enantiomer was preferentially hydrolyzed. The optical purity of<br>
the remaining ester was 92% at 56% conversion (see Table 1, Reaction 21).<br>
Example 4, ANL-catalyzed reaction of FTC butyrate in 50% n-amyl alcohol/aqueous mxture<br><br>
The reaction conditions and procedures were the same as in Example 1, except that 200 mg of soluble ANL was used. The conversion was 45% after 36 h. The optical purity of the remaining ester was 63% at 45% conversion (see Table 1, Reaction 22).<br><br>
Example 5, PLE-catalyzed conversion of (±) -FTC butyrate in 20% of isopropanol (or other water-miscible organic co-solvents) /aqueous mixture with 2% substrate concentration<br><br>
The following example illustrates the state of the art using high amounts of enzyme catalysts in a homogeneous system. To a solution of 1 ml of Altus PLE solution 650 units/ml from Altus Biologics, Ino. in 39 ml of 0.3 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) was added 10 ml of 10% FTC butyrate in isopropanol. The resulting mixture was stirred at 24-260C and the reaction progress was monitored by HPLC. The conversion reached 51% and the optical purity of the remaining chiral nonracemic ester compound was greater than 99% (48% chemical yield) after a 22 h reaction. These results are based on HPLC analysis of the remaining chiral nonracemic ester compound. The aqueous layer included hydrolyzed products (+)-FTC and (-)—FTC. The ratio of (+)—FTC and (-)—FTC was 96.6 to 3.4. The organic layer was evaporated to give 0.457 g of (-)—FTC butyrate.<br><br>
A similar reaction was performed by using other water miscible organic co—solvents, including<br>
acetonitrile, DMF, l—methyl—2—pyrrolidinone, methanol, ethanol, tert-butanol, DMSO, pyridine, di(ethylene glycol)methyl ether, PEG 200, and PEG 600 etc. Acetonitrile gave the same high enantioselectivity as isopropanol and required similarly large amounts of enzyme. All other solvents gave lower enantioselectivity than isopropanol.<br><br><br>
Example 6, PLE-catalyzed conversion of (±) -FTC butyrate in 20% of isopropanol/aquecus mixture with 5% substrate concentration<br><br>
To a solution of 2.5 ml of Altus 21.1 solution<br><br>
650 uxi,its/ml from Altus Biologics, Inc. in 37.5 ml of<br><br>
0.3	M phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) was added 10.0 ml of<br><br>
25% FTC butyrate in isopropanol. Under these<br><br>
conditions, the substrate was incompletely dissolved.<br><br>
The resulting mixture was stirred at 24-26C and the<br><br>
reaction was monitored by (-(PLC. The conversion reached<br><br>
60% and the optical purity of the remaining eater was<br><br>
74% (38% chemical yield) after 96 h reaction time. The<br><br>
enantioselectivity was much lower than the reaction<br><br>
with a 2% substrate concentration.<br><br><br>
Example 7, P1.1-catalyzed conversion of (±)-FTC butyrate in 30% iaopropanol/aqueous solution and a 3% substrate concentration<br><br>
To a solution of 1.5 ml of Altus PLE solution<br><br>
650 units/nil from Altus Biologics, Inc. in 33.5 ml of<br><br>
0.3	M phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) was added 15 ml of 10%<br><br>
FTC butyrate in isopropanol. The resulting mixture was<br><br>
stirred at 24-26C and the reaction was monitored by<br><br>
HPLC. The conversion was 8% after 2 h and did not<br><br>
increase after that. The enzyme rapidly lost all activity in the 30% isopropanol.<br><br><br>
Table 1 summarizes the results of resolution reactions of FTC—butyrate with various enzymes in<br><br>
biphasic non-homogeneous systems comprising various not more than about 50% water miscible organic solvents an~ aqueous buffer solutions.<br><br><br>

Examples 5-7 illustrate some of the problems with using water miscible alcohols in homogeneous systems for the process of the present invention. Such systems produce product with reduced optical purity, prolong reaction times, and deactivate the enzyme.<br><br><br>
Examples 8-13, PLE Catalyzed Conversion of (+) FTCButyrate in Non-Homogeneous Systems using n-Amyl Alcohol and Water.<br><br>
The reaction conditions and procedures were the same as in Example 1. The non-homogeneous system comprises 1 ml of Altus P1.1 solution (650 U/ml) as catalyst and the volumes of amyl alcohol and phosphate buffer used are indicated in Table 2 below. Note that in each case, the selectivity of conversion of the (+)— isomer was almost absolute, so that the desired conversion of slightly greater than 50% results in<br><br>
enantiomeric purities of the unreacted (-)ester of nearly 100% <br><br>
(See Table 2).<br><br><br>

Examples 14-30, PLE-Catalyzed Conversion of (±) FTCButyrate in non-hcuaogenous systans comprising n-amyl alcohol and water mixtures in the presence of surfactants.<br><br>
Examples 14 through 30 are shown in Table 3. The reaction conditions and procedures were the same as in Example 1. The non-homogeneous system comprises 1 ml of Altus PLE solution (650 U/ml) as catalyst and 1 ml (Examples 14—21, 23, 24, and 30) or 0.1 g of surfactant (Examples 25—29) were added as surfactant to the reaction mixtures. The organic component comprised ri-amyl alcohol and the aqueous component comprised 0.3 M phosphate buffer in a 50:50 ratio.<br><br>
Table 3, Examples 14 through 30<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br><br>
The broad screening of surfactants, as shown in Table 3, reveals that some are activating (see Examples 14, 15, 19, 20, 24, 28, and 30) and some are inhibitory (see 16, 23, 27 and 29). Fifteen surfactants were chosen for further analysis. The surfactants Tergitol NP-4, Tween 80, Tyloxapol and dioctyl sulfosuccinate sodium all enhanced the PLE activity to roughly the same extent. The enhancement in rate is most apparent at the end of the reaction and may be due to stabilization of the enzyme and prevention of precipitation as well as an effect on catalytic efficiency.<br><br><br>
Example 31-34, PLE Catalyzed Conversion of (±) FTC- Butyrate in Si-phasic n-Amyl Alcohol/Water mixtures in the presence of Tween—BO.<br><br>
Examples 31 through 34 are shown in Table 4. The reaction conditions and procedures were the same as in Example 1. The non—homogeneous system comprises Tween 80 as surfactant, 0.6 ml Altus PLE solution (650 U/ml) as the catalyst and the volume of amyl alcohol and 0.3 M phosphate buffer used are indicated in the table below.<br><br><br>
Table 4, Examples 31 through 34<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br><br>
Examples 35, Complimentary reductions in both emzyme and organic solvent requirements<br><br>
The reaction conditions and procedures were the same as in Example 1. The non-homogeneous system comprised 0.5 ml of Tween 80 as surfactant, 0.3 ml of Altus PLE solution (650 U/mI) as catalyst, and 2.0 ml of amyl alcohol and 7.5 ml of 0.3 H phosphate buffer were the solvents. The non-homogeneous system comprised 25% organic component and 75% aqueous component. After 48 hours, the extent of conversion was 50% and the optical purity of the remaining ester was 99.3%.<br><br>
In this example, the amount of both enzyme and organic solvent were reduced by approximately half from the level used in Examples 31—34, with no loss of product yield. Furthermore, the enzyme requirement was only 25% of that required in Example 1.<br><br><br>
Examples 36-39, Dioctyl sulfosuccinate (Dioctyl 58) as surfactant.<br><br>
Examples 36 through 39 are shown in Table 5. The reaction conditions and procedures were the same as in Example 1. The non—homogeneous system comprised dioctyl sulfosucciriate (Dioctyl SS) as surf actant and 0.4 ml of Altus PLE enzyme solution (650 U/nil) in 8 ml of 0.3 M phosphate buffer and 2 ml of amyl alcohol.<br><br><br>

The reaction the same as in Exampleconditions and rocedures were<br><br>
1. The catalyst comprised 714<br><br><br>
total units of porcine liver esterase (Sigma, St. Louis, MO). The non-homogeneous system comprised 50% n-amyl alcohol as organic component and 50% 0.3 1'! phosphate buffer at pH 7.4 as aqueous component. After 24 hours, the extent of conversion was 50% and the optical purity of the remaining ester was 97.5%.<br><br><br>
Example 41, Rate enhancement with low enzyme loadings and anionic surfactant<br><br>
In addition to the use of Tween—BO, the anionic surfactarit dioctyl sulfosuccinate sodium salt, was chosen to achieve rate enhancement. As shown in Table 6, a 1% loading of this surfactant in the nonhomogeneous system was sufficient for significant rate enhancement.<br><br>
Reaction conditions included: 1 g FTC<br><br>
butyrate, 0.4% PLE loading, organic solvent 1—pentanol,<br><br>
2:8 solvent ratio, reaction carried out at 30 0C (Table6)<br><br><br><br>

A preferred embodiment of this invention includes an enzyme loading of 0.3 to 0.4 % relative to FTC butyrate with a 10% substrate loading. A number of reactions were performed on slightly larger scale to more accurately determine the run to run variation and the effect of conversion on optical purity.
