				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The invention relates to a connection element for connecting building components effectively, especially building components such as, for example, wall, ceiling and floor elements, as are used In prefabricated building construction. Prefabricated building construction is understood to mean buildings that are intended to stand for a relatively long time as well as buildings that are used only for a relatively short time such as, for example, buildings for emergency accommodation after an earthquake, for military uses, for trade fair constructions etc..<br>
Various connection arrangements are known in prefabricated building construction for connecting wall, ceiling and floor elements. Frequently, for example, wall elements are push-fitted together and then the push-fit connections are bolted together. So-called brackets, which are screwed to the locations being connected, are increasingly being used in prefabricated building construction. Brackets are adequately known from the prior art so that reference is made merely by way of example to the document US 5,284,311.<br>
There is, and there will also be in the future, a need to minimise work on SIte because work on site generally has to be carried out using local workers who may, depending on circumstances, be poorly trained or expensive. Furthermore, there are scarcely any possibilities for automating installation on site, as a result of which reduction of the costs arising on sITe can be achieved only with difficulty. A further problem is the construction time, which, in the case of laborious manual installation of wall elements, can be shortened only to a limited degree.<br>
It is accordingly problematic that, in prefabricated building construction, manufacture of the building components can be carried out with a high degree of automation and a high production quality can also be achieved, whereas, during installation of the prefabricated elements on site, the speed of installation and the quality of work can, in contrast, be influenced only to a small extent.<br>
There is, however, a permanent need to reduce construction costs and to improve the qualfty of assembled structures, the expression "assembled structures" being understood to mean any structure that is put together on site from prefabricated elements, the necessary work substantially being carried out manually by qualified workers.<br>
The invention relates likewise to a device for effectively connecting sub-assemblies in a very great variety of forms to wall, ceiling and floor surfaces of buildings or frameworks. The following list of sub-assemblies is not exhaustive and is intended merely to illustrate the wide range of applications of the invention:<br>
Sub-assemblies from the area of heating, ventilation and air-conditioning: wall radiators, kitchen unit with gas or electric cooker, oven, air-conditioning unit for wall assembly, utility module having a hot water tank, hot water production unit and various additional devices such as, for example, water filters.<br>
Sub-assemblies from the sanitary area:<br>
modules having wash-basin, WC or shower cubicle.<br>
In similar manner to the production of prefabricated buildings, there is also the problem, in the case of the sub-assemblies mentioned above, of effective and reliable installation on site, especially in cases where the sub-assemblies have a large number of connection points and connections such as, for example, for water, gas, electricity or/and telephone and data-processing devices. Because the complexity of the subassemblies is Increasing further, highly qualified skilled workers are required for installation on site. As a result, installation costs are increasing. If qualified staff are not used there is an increase in failures, for example as a result of incontect electrical or signal connections, the correction of which likewise gives rise to high costs.<br>
The problem of the present invention is accordingly to make effective the Installation of building components and sub-assemblies in the construction sector so that even less well qualified workers can carry out complicated installation work quickly and without mistakes.<br><br>
The problem is solved by the connection arrangement of the present invention which is quite distinct from the disclosure in US Patent No. US -A - 4 - 993 564 in that the quick coupling of the US Patent No. US -A - 4 - 993 564 is intended and suitable for connecting fluid lines of machine tools, not for prefabricated building construction. Although the coupling halves of US Patent No. US -A - 4 - 993 564 are brought into engagement by a joining movement, they are not connected to one another as a result thereof.<br>
An additional difference is that the mechanical connection of components fastened at the coupling halves from US patent No. US -A - 4 - 993 564 is not accomplished as a result of the joining movement of the two coupling halves; rather, clamping in position is necessary. In case of the connection arrangement according to the present invention, the mechanical connection is brought about by the joining movement; additional manipulation is neither necessary nor possible. This has the crucial advantage that once, for example, wall elements have been brought together, it is not possible to forget to connect them mechanically by means of shifting a lever.<br>
The present invention provides a connection element for connecting building components or subasemblies mechanically, the connection element having two coupling halves, which can be brought into engagement by a joining movement. The coupling halves can be fastened to the building components or sub-assemblies being connected, using fastening means such as, for example, screws or adhesive. The coupling halves and the fastening means are so dimensioned that, when forces occurring in use are applied, the mechanically stable state of the connected building components or subassemblies is maintained for a long period. Inside the coupling halves there are arranged line coupling halves. The line coupling halves are used for connecting liquid lines or gas lines or electrical lines or signal lines such as, for example, for telephone or video devices. The line coupling halves are connected to the ends of the lines. The lines pass through openings to the outside or pass inside the building component or sub-assembly.<br>
In accordance with the invention, the coupling halves in the in-use connected state are in the form of housings of the line coupling halves. The housing comprising the pushed-together coupling halves is so formed that the line coupling halves and the end portions of the lines being connected are protected from damaging operational or environmental influences. Because the operational or environmental influences may be very varied, the person skilled in the art will, on the basis erf the technical teaching imparted, have to design the coupling halves so that, with regard to the specific application, they adequately protect the line coupling halves and the end portions of the lines being connected. It may accordingly be necessary, for example under certain operational conditions, to provide a hermetically seeded housing in order to avoid corrosion on the line coupling halves. In that case, the line coupling halves are, in the connected state, enclosed on all sides and can have seals that, in the connected state, prevent the entry of atmospheric humidity or water. The very great variety of forms of such seals are adequately known to the person skilled in the art, for example from the field of the installation of electric cables in wet rooms.<br>
It should be mentioned that the procedure for dimensioning and designing  the coupling halves is as follows:<br>
a.	dimensioning according to the mechanical operational forces to be expected, taking<br>
into account the installation situation and the space required for the line coupling<br>
halves;<br>
b.	dimensioning according to the damaging operational and environmental Influences<br>
to be expected, the specific installation conditions also having to be taken into account<br>
in tNs instance. Accordingly, a coupling half can, for example, be open to the rear,<br>
despite a requirement for sealing, if the coupling half is arranged within a recess in the<br>
building compornent being connected. Covering and sealing to the rear are, in that<br>
instance, accomplished by the building component.<br>
The basic idea of the invention therefore consists in providing mechanical fastening elements that have couplings for energy and signal supply. These mechanical fastening elements are used in same manner as the conventional brackets, that is to say they are fastened using fastening means such as, for example, screws, at the locations intencted for that purpose on the building components or sub-assemblies being connected. The mechanical fastening elements are so constructed that the line couplings forth the energy and signal lines are, in the connected state, so encased that they are adequately protected against damaging influences.<br>
The main advarrtage of the Invention is that, for the first time, there is provided a connector that can be used in highly universal manner, that - depending on the requirement - can be used in the same manner as a conventional bracket for a very great variety of purposes and that can be installed with little difficulty at freely selectable locatrons on the building components or sub-assemblies being connected. As Is usual in the case of conventional brackets, the connection element according to the Invention can be arranged recessed in grooves or in blind drilled holes.<br>
It is accordingly no longer necessary to carry out connection of the individual supply and signal lines separately, after joining the building elements together, m a result of which expensive Installation time is saved. Because skilled workers are no longer<br>
required for connection of the supply and signal lines, the functional reliability of the connection locsAions can be substantially increased. The invention is found to be especially advantageous in the case of modern buildings that are controlled by a building management system. Such building management systems require, amongst other things, a large number of sensors, which are connected to electronic control devices, resulting in extensive wiring. When that wiring is already integrated into the walls, ceilings etc. and is connected automatically and without error in the course of Installation of the walls, ceilings etc., costs can be reduced and quality increased.<br>
It will be clear to the person skilled in the art that the general inventive idea can be put into practice In a great variety of arrangements. The description of embodiments of the subordinate claims and of exemplary embodiments indicates basic arrangements so that the invention is adequately disclosed to the person skilled in the art.<br>
According to claim 2, the connection element is so arranged that the direction of the joining movement of the coupling halves is the same as the direction of the joining movement of the line coupling halves, that is to say when pushing together the medianical coupling halves the line coupling halves are also pushed together in the same direction. This embodiment has a simple arrangement.<br>
According to claim 3, the connection element is so arranged that the direction of the joining movement of the coupling halves differs from the direction of the joining movement of the line coupling halves, that is to say the directions of the joining movements are not the same. This embodiment is advantageous when structural dimensions of the components being connected allow for only restricted space conditions, that not being feasible using an embodiment according to claim 2.<br>
According to dawn 4, the connection element is so arranged that the line coupling halves are joined together at the same time as the coupling halves, that is to say when the mechanical eoupiing shells are completely joined together the line coupling halves are iilso joined together. This embodiment makes possible a simple and economical arrangement.<br>
According to claim 5, the connection element is so arranged that, during connection, first the coupling halves are completely connected and only thereafter are the line coupling halves joined together. This embodiment has particular advantages under especially tough installation conditions. For example, the line coupling halves can remain in a protected position until the coupling halves have been completely closed. Connection of the line coupling halves is performed only within a completely protected housing.<br>
According to claim 6, the connection element is so arranged that the line coupling halves can be connected singly or together by means of a connection mechanism. The connection mechanism has the following features: a slide mechanism for bringing together the line coupling halves. The person skilled in the art will understand a slide mechanism in this context to be a guideway on which or in which the coupling halves can slide on a track. Such guideways or slide arrangements can be found in relevant textbooks of design theory and are therefore not further described. In order to drive the slide mechanism, a drive mechanism is provided, the subject-matter of claims 7 and 8 comprisirg two possible embodiments of a drive mechanism.<br>
According to claim 7, the drive mechanism has a spring mechanism, wherein a blocked, biased spring drives the slide mechanism when blocking of the spring is released automatically or manually. Automatic release of the blocking can be carried out, for example, as a result of displacement of a pin blocking the spring, which is brought about  when ttie mechanical coupling halves are joined together and, as a result, blocking of the spring is removed. Such an-angements may either be found complete in relevant textbooks or are part of the technical knowledge that is always at the disposal of a design engineer, who is therefore not required to act inventively.<br>
According to daim 8, the drive mechanism is arranged to be actuated manually. For example, the drive mechanism can be actuated using a key, that is to say when the coupling halves are completely connected, a key-like tool is pushed into a recess - in similar manner to a key-hole. The slide mechanism is actuated by rotating the tool. The line coupling halves can accordingly be joined together, as well as separated again. Here too, the person skilled in the art will be familiar with a very great variety of<br>
arrangements for solving this problem such as, for example, arrangements from the field of locks or sinple arrangements having a rack and pinion, wherein the pinion is turned using the tool, resulting in movement of the rack, which is coupled to the slide mechanism. The person skilled in the art will likewise also be familiar with hydraulic or pneumatic solutions, wherein a piston coupled to the slide mechanism is displaced as a result of the Introduction of liquid or air into a cylinder.<br>
According to claim 9, the connection element is so arranged that the coupling halves have grooves located on the inside and projections matched thereto, which engage with one another when the connection element is in the connected state and serve to maintain or mnprove the mechanical connection properties. Arranged inside the grooves and projections engaging with one another are electric contacts. Using this embodiment, the space required for the electric line coupling halves can be reduced because the electric contacts are integrally connected to the coupling half in question.<br>
According to daim 10, the connection element is so an-anged that inside the coupling halves there are provided flat portions that are in a close positional relationship to one another when the coupling halves are in the connected state. Provided on those flat portions are contact elements for producing a signal connection. When the coupling halves are in the connected state, the contact elements located opposite one another touch and the contact is closed. Because the currents flowing for the signal connection are only low, the contact elements can be of small dimensions. As a result of this embodiment, the space required for the signal-related line coupling halves can be reduced.<br>
According to clam 11, there is provided a connection element whose coupling halves have a rectanginim plinth portion, in which fastening holes are provided. Arranged on the plinth portion are wedge-shaped or conical engaging elements and wedge-shaped or cone-shaped  recesses matched thereto. The plinth portion can be fastened by simple means on a surface, in a recess or in a groove. The form of the engaging elements can be freely selected by the person skilled in the art and matched to the relevant requaiements without requiring an inventive step.<br>
According to claim 12, there is provided a connection element wherein at least one engaging element pair is in the form of a pipe coupling that can be pushed together and that forms the connectlon for a liquid line. This embodiment is espedally economical because the double function of the engaging element pair saves having a seprate pipe coupling.<br>
Acosrding to claim 13, in the case of the media supply connection eiements in pipe form, there is provided a pressure-actuatable internal lock and internal seal which bring about locking and sealing of the connection when it is subjected to pressure by means of liquid or gas. The advantage of this embodiment is that, after all media connection locations have been completely installed, they can be sealed in a single operation by the propagation of pressure.<br>
According to claim 14, the connections are produced as follows: A pressure-activatable adhesive is applied in the factory to the joining press surfaces at the connection locations. Such adhesives are known to the person skiIIed in the art. They comprise, for example, smell spherules in which adhesive is embedded. When carrying out joinrig under pressure, for example when pressing surfaces together, the spherules burst and rebate the adhesive so that the joining press surfaces are bonded to one another. A very stable connection is produced as a result of this measure.<br>
According to cliam 15, there is provided on the joining press surfaces, which are in pressing contact on being joined together, an asymmetrical surface toothed arrangement, which forms a unilaterally acting frictional and positive connection after pressing together.<br>
It is left to the person skilled in the art to select suitable locations for arranging the adhesive connetion or the surface toothed arrangement because it is only necessary, for that purpose, to have knowledge of the strength or static characteristics of the specific building construction.<br>
According to claim 16, the contacts of the electrical connection elements are encapsulated. The capsules are in the form of a plug and coupling. Arranged over<br>
eadi of the areas that are pushed together is a thin film that hermetically seals the electric contacts and, as a result, prevents the entry of moisture and, consequently, corrosion. The films are broken when the plug and coupling are joined together. However, that occurs only once a hermetic seal has again been produced by the connection of plug and coupling. A specific arrangement is described in an exemplary embodiment.<br>
According to claim 17, there is introduced into the plug and the coupling a moisture-binding substance which lastingly absorbs environmental moisture that may still enter when the plug and coupling are joined together.<br>

Figs. 13-17 show application examples of the invention.<br>
Fig. 1 shows, in diagrammatic form, a first embodiment of the invention, wherein reference symbols  1a and lb denote wall portions in which there is arranged the line connection, which consists of a large number of plugs 2a and a large number of couplings 2b matched thereto. The plugs 2a are held in an assembly holder 3a and the couplings 2b are hdd in an assembly holder 3b. The assembly holders are fastened in corresponnding recesses in the wall portions. The recesses are so constructed that the wall portions can be pushed into one another and form a closed wall portion in the pushed-together state. Fig. 1a shows, in a side view, two wall portions la and 1b having recesses, in which assembly holders 3a and 3b are fastened by means of screw connections. It will be clear to the person skilled in the art that the fastening of the assembly holders 3a and 3b can be accomplished in various ways so that further explanations in this regard can be dispensed with. Fig. 1b shows the invention in a top view, wherein three line plugs 2a and three line couplings 2b can be seen. In the present case, sealing between the line plug 2a and the line coupling 2b is carried out by means of an O ring 4. When the two wall portions 1a and lb are, as shown in Fig. 1c, brought together in the direction of the an-ow, the line plugs 2a and the   line couplings 2b come into engagement. In order to compensate for manufacturing toteranws, the line plugs 2a and/or the line couplings 2b are mounted in floating {i.e. lateririiy displaceable) manner. This measure guarantees a constraint-free and reliable connection. Fig. 1d shows the end state, wherein the three lines are connected to one another reliably and sealed. Additional constructional measures<br>
ensure that the two wall portions 1a and 1b are held in the position according to Fig. Id.<br>
Fig. 2 shows. In diagrammatic form, a second embodiment of the invention, wherein assembly holcters 3a and 3b have a centring device 5a, 5b, which guarantees reliable joining. The centring device is so dimensioned that the transverse forces tiat occur when the walls am joined together are reliably taken up, so that the coupling halves are not damaged by being brought together in misaligned manner. Fig. 2 is analogous to Fig. 1, so that the person skilled in the art will not need it to be described again.<br>
Fig. 3 shows, in diagrammatic form, a third embodiment of the invention, wherein there is provided a locking device 6 which reliably prevents the building comporients such as, for example, walls from coming apart again and, consequently, the coupling halves from becomirg loose or, as a result, from being damaged in such a way that sealing is no longer ensured. In the present example, the locking device 6 has a pressure piston and cylinder arrngegement 6a and also a locking piston and cylinder arrangement 6b, whith are connected to one another by means of a hydraulic line 6c. When the building compopoents and the coupling halves are reliably connected, there is exerted on the pressure pston of the pressure piston and cylinder arrangement 6a a force that displaces the piston, as a result of which the locking piston of the locking piston and cylinder arrangement 6b is pressed, by means of the hydraulic line 6c, into a recess 6d, as a result of which the building components are firmly and reliably connected to one another. The application of force to the pressure piston can be accomplished,for  example, by utilising the force exerted on joining the building components together. In Fig. 3d it can be seen that the locking piston has engaged in the recess 6d.<br>
A means of producing a lasting and stable connection is shown in Fig. 4. All contacting surfaces of the centring device are coated with a special adhesive 7. When the contacting surfaces are pressed together under strong pressure, the adhesive 7 is activated and it fixed connects the contacting surfaces to one another. Such pressure-activaftable adhesives are known to the person skilled in the art so that a more detailed exportation thereof is not necessary.<br>
In Order to prevent the coupling halves from corroding, which is especially disadvantageous, for example, in the case of electrical connections, the coupling halves are covered with a protective film 8 according to Fig. 5. On joinirng, the protective film 8 is broken in controlled manner so that the hitherto hermetically sealed, that is to say non-corrrroded, elements of the coupling halves are joined together. In a further embodiment, sealing elements are provided w/hich re-establish a hermetic seal after joining.<br>
Fig. 6 shows a single and very effective measure for reliable and lasting connection. The contactvig surfaces of the centring device are provided with a multi-wedge-shaped surface toothed arrangement 9. When the contacting surfaces are pressed against one another in the course of joining, the teeth of the surface toothed arrangement 9 lock in and remain in that position so that a positive and frictional connection is produced. The person skilled in the art will know that, for this purpose, the multi-toothed arrangement must be asymmetrical so that the hooking-in effect occurs in only one direction, that is to say, in the present example, on pressing together the contacting surfaces.<br>
Figs. 1 to 6 show the various embodiments of the invention with reference to a substantially similar basic form of coupling. The various installation phases are illustrated so that it is possible, for the person skilled in the art, to dispense with re|:»titions in the desoiption. The following examples show that it is also possible to use basic forms of coupling that are different in principle.<br>
Fig. 7 shows an emtjodiment of the coupling having two coupling halves 1a, 1b, with only a water pipe 10 being connected in this embodiment. When the cuppling halves are pushed together, the two pipe portions 10a, 10b are located one alive the other. A seal arrangwnent 1 la, 11b is provided for the purpose of sealing.<br>
Fig. 8 shows a coupling half la wherein an angled water pipe 10 is movabty an-anged. The water pipe has, on its surface, a toothed arrangement 12, which is in engagement with a pinion 13. Tthe water pipe 10 is pressed against the pinion 13 by a counter-<br>
mounting 14. The pinion 13 is connected to a pin 15 which is rotatably mounted in a mounting 16. By means of a tool 17, the water pipe can accordingly be displaced in its longitudinal extent. When the coupling half 1a is placed on a coupling half matched thereto, the coupling  halves of the water pipes to be connected are not yet in engagement. Only as a result of tuming the tool 17 and the resulting displacement of the first water pipe towards the water pipe of the other coupling half is the connection accomplished. This exemplary embodiment is accordingly a practical fomi of the invention according to claim 5 and the claims dependent thereon.<br>
Fig. 9 shows asimiiar coupling half la to Fig. 8. The water pipe 10 is likewise displaceably mounted and is urged in the direction of the arrow by means of a spring 18. when the coupling half la is placed on a coupling half matched thereto, the coupling halves of the water pipes to be connected are not yet in engagement because a blocking pin 19 prevents movement of the pipe. Only by pulling out the blocking pin 19, using a put! rope 20, Is a stop 21 released, as a result of which the pipe moves in the direction of the anrow and is coupled to its counterpart component. The sealing arrangements required for the purpose preferably have O rings.<br>
Fig. 10 shows a coupling half la having an integrally formed water pipe coupling 22. The integral formatton saves having a separate coupling element for the water line. As can be seen from the illustration, the water pipe coupling forms a sturdy central element which is also capable of taking up large mechanical forces. Reference symbol 23 derates a spring-loaded blocking flap, shown in diagrammatic form, which on coupling together is pressed in the direction of the an-ow by the counterpart component and In the final state snaps into a recess in the counterpart component. As a result, the coupling is effectively prevented from coming apart.<br>
