				<td>SOLE) OXIDE FUEL CELL HAVING A BUFFER LAYER<br>
BACKGROUND Field of the Disclosure [0001] The present invention generally relates to solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs).<br>
Description of the Related Art<br>
[0002) In pursuit of high-efficiency, environmentally friendly energy production, solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) technologies have emerged as a potential alternative to conventional turbine and combustion engines. SOFCs are generally defined as a type of fuel cell in which the electrolyte is solid metal oxide (desirably non-porous or limited to closed porosity), in which O2* is transported from the cathode to the cathode/electrolyte interface. Fuel cell technologies typically have a higher efficiency and have lower CO and NOx emissions than traditional combustion engines. In addition, fuel cell technologies tend to be quiet and vibration-fee. Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs; have an advantage over other fuel cell varieties. For example, SOFCs may use fuel sources such as natural gas, propane, methanol, kerosene, and diesel; among others because SOFCs operate at high enough operating temperatures to allow for internal fuel reformation. However, challenges exist in reducing the cost of SOFC systems to be competitive with combustion engines and other fuel cell technologies. These challenges include lowering the cost of materials, improving degradation or life cycle, and improving operation characteristics such as current and power density.<br>
[0003] In the context of long-term operational characteristics of SOFCs, conductivity degradation is a notable parameter that should be addressed to enable formation of commercially visible components. Generally, degradation of has been attributed to a variety of influences, such as changes in the crystalline structure of the solid electrolyte, reaction of the electrolyte with impurities, as well as on-and-off cycling leading to cracks and flaws within the electrolyte layer. Lost conductivity, increases in resistivity, and degradation of contact surface also lead to a reduction in operating voltages and current densities, negatively impacting the performance of the fuel cell,<br><br>
including reduction of the power output. As a result of performance degradation, expensive fuel cell components arc replaced more frequently, leading to higher overall energy costs.<br>
[0004] As such, many typical fuel cell systems suffer from deficiencies in providing a low cost alternative to other energy sources. In view of the foregoing, it is considered generally desirable to provide improved SOFC designs suitable for use in. demanding SOFC applications.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0013] According to one aspect of the present disclosure, a fuel cell is provided that includes a cathode incorporating a lanthanum manganate material, the cathode having channels for receiving a flow of oxygen and a buffer layer extending along the channels,   il-e fuel cell also has an anode including channels for the flow of fuel therethrough and an electrolyte layer disposed between the cathode and the anode. A buffer layer may be positioned for passage of oxygen therethrough from the channels prior to passage into the lanthanum manganate material, the buffer layer thereby buffering the flow of oxygen into the lanthanum manganate.<br>
[0014] Referring to the anode of the SOFC,. the anode is the electrode that facilitates oxidation of the fuel in the redox reaction that generates a current within the SOFC<br><br>
device. Generally, the anode is referred to as the fuel electrode since it typically transports a fuel gas, such as hydrogen (Ha), through the anode material to the anode/electrolyte interface where the oxidation reaction occurs. A high volume of porosity in the anode material aids rapid transport of the fuel gas to the anode/electrolyte interface for oxidation. According to one embodiment, the percent porosity of the anode material is not less than about 10vol% of the total volume of the anode. According to another embodiment, the percent porosity of the anode is not less than about 15vol%, such as not less man about 20vol%, or even not less than about 30vol%.<br>
[0015] Typically, the fuel gas channels are positioned in close proximity to the anode to provide effective transport of the fuel gas from the channels, through the anode material, and ultimately to the anode/eleotrolyte boundary. In some embodiments the channels are adjacent to the anode, such as a channel structure overlaying the anode material. While in other embodiments, the channels are integrated into the channels and extend into the anode materiai.<br>
[0016] According to one embodiment, the anode comprises a cermet material, that is, a combination of a. ceramic and metallic material. For example, the anode may be formed with a nickel and yttria-stabilized zirconia or nickel and gadolinium oxide-stabilized ceria. The nickel is generally produced through the reduction of nickel oxide included in the anode precursor, such as a green ceramic composition that is heat-treated.<br>
[0017] Referring; to the electrolyte layer, the electrolyte layer is adjacent to the anode, disposed between the anode and cathode. The electrolyte may be formed from materials including zirconia, ceria, gallia, and other known ionic conductors. Oxygen ion conductivity is enhanced with oxide stabilizer materials such as yttrium, scandium, samarium, ytterbium and gadolinium. Stabilizing materials for zirconia include oxides such as Ti02, Ce-Oz, CaO, Y203, MgO, SC2OB, In2o3, and SnO2 For example, the electrolyte may be formed from yttria-stabilized zirconia, scandia-doped zirconia, ytterbia-doped zirconia, samarium oxide-doped ceria, gadolinium oxide-doped ceria, or calcia-doped ceria, among others. According to a particular embodiment, the electrolyte material is yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ).<br><br>
[0018] In one embodiment, the electrolyte material comprises not less than about 8.0mol% oxide stabilizer in a zirconia matrix, such as not less than about 10mol% oxide stabilizer, or not less than about 12mol% of an oxide stabilizer. Still, other embodiments demonstrate a greater degree of oxide stabilizer, such as not less than about 15mol% within the zirconia. According to the embodiments herein, the amount of oxide stabilize within the zirconia is altered depending upon the desired phase, crystal structure, and electrical characteristics of the electrolyte material.<br>
[0019] The electrolyte is generally a dense structure having a porosity notably less man the porosity of the anode. Moreover, unlike the porosity of the anode, the porosity of the electrolyte layer is generally closed porosity, and generally not a network of interconnected pores, as the porosity of the anode. According to one embodiment, the percent porosity of the electrolyte layer is not greater than about 10vol%, or not greater than about 5.0vol%. The percent porosity within the electrolyte layer can be even less, such as not greater than about 2.5vol%3 or still not greater than about 1.0vol%,<br>
[0020] Referring to the cathode, the cathode is positioned adjacent the electrolyte thereby substantially defining a cathode/electrolyte interface that facilitates the reduction of oxygen for the redox reaction within the SOFC. Similar to the anode, the cathode is a porous material for facilitating the flow of gas- Typically, the gas flowing through the cathode includes oxygen, such air or another oxygen-rich source. According to one embodiment, the percent porosity of the cathode is not less than about 10vol% of the total volume of the cathode. Other embodiments have a greater percent porosity, such as not less than about 15vol%, not less than about 20vol%, or still, not less than about 30vol%.<br>
[0021] Materials for the cathode generally include lanthanum manganate materials. Particularly, tus cathode can be made of a doped lanthanum manganate material, giving the cathode composition aperovskite type crystal structure, Accordingly, the doped lanthanum manganate material has a general composition represented by the formula, (La1-xAx)?Mn03.s, where the dopant material is designated by "A" and is substituted within the material for lanthanum (La), on the A-sites of the perovskite crystal structure. The dopant material can be selected from alkaline earth metals, lead,<br><br>
or generally divalent cations having an atomic ratio of between about 0.4 and 0.9 Angstroms. As such, according to one embodiment, the dopant material is selected fiom the group of elements consisting of Mg, Ba, Sr, Ca, Co, Ga, Pb, and Zr. According to a particular embodiment, the dopant is Sr, and the cathode material is a lanthanum strontium manganate material, known generally as LSM.<br>
[0022] Referring to the stoichiometry of the doped lanthanum manganate cathode material, according to one embodiment, parameters such as the type of atoms present, the percentage of vacancies within the crystal structure, and the ratio of atoms, particularly the ratio of La/Mn within the cathode material, are provided to manage the formation of conductivity-limiting compositions at the cathode/electrolyte interface during the operation of the fuel cell. The formation of conductivity-limiting compositions reduces the efficiency of the cell and reduces the lifetime of the SOFC. According to one embodiment, the doped lanthanum manganate cathode material comprises (La^AjOyMnO** wherein x is not greater than about 0,5, y is not greater than about 1.0, and the ratio of La/Mn is not greater than about 1.0. The value of x within the doped lanthanum manganate composition represents the amount of dopant substituted for La within the structure. According to one embodiment, x is not greater than about 0.5, such as not greater than about 0.4 or 0.3. Still, the amount of dopant provided within the cathode material may be less, such that x is not greater than about 0.2, or still 0.1, and particularly within a range of between about 0.4 and 0.05.<br>
[0023] In a particular embodiment, the dopant material is Sr (an LSM cathode), such that the cathode composition is (La1-xSrx)yMno3-8 where x is not greater than about 0.5, such as not greater than about 0.4, 0.3, 0.2 or even not greater than about 0.1, and particularly within a range of between about 0.3 and 0.05. A cathode having a dopant concentration as described in the previous embodiments is desirable for reducing the formation of conductivity-limiting compositions at the cathode/electrolyte interface during the operation of the fuel cell.<br>
[0024] In further reference to the stoichiometry of the cathode, the value of y in the general formula (Lai.xAx)yMn03-6 represents the percent occupancy of atoms on the A-site within the crystal lattice. Thought of another way, the value of y may also be subtracted from 1.0 and represent the percentage of vacancies on the A-site within the<br><br>
crystal lattice. For the purposes of this disclosure, a doped lanthanum manganate material having a. value of y less than 1.0 is termed an "A-site deficient" structure, since the A-sites within the crystal structure are not 100% occupied. According to one embodiment, y is not greater than about 0.95, such as not greater than about 0.90, 0-88, or even not greater than about 0.85. In a particular embodiment, the cathode material is LSM (the dopamt material is Sr having a composition of (La1Sr)yMno3-, and the vaLue of y is not greater than about 1.0, such as not greater than about 0.95, 0.93 or even 0.90, and particularly within a range of between about 0.70 and 0.99. A cathode having an A-site deficient, doped lanthanum manganate composition, as provided in the previously described embodiments, is desirable for reducing the formation of conductivity-lirniting compositions at the cathode/electrolyte interface during the operation of the fuel cell.<br>
[0025] In further reference to the composition of the doped lanthanum manganate cathode material, according to one embodiment, the ratio of La/Mn is not greater than about 1.0. The ratio of La/Mn within the cathode material can be modified by the addition of a dopant (the value of x in the general formula) as well as the creation of A-site vacancies (related to the value of y) within the lanthanum manganate crystal structure- As such, in another embodiment, the ratio of La/Mn is less than 1.0, such as less than about 0.97,0.95, or even less than about 0.93. According to a particular embodiment, the cathode material is LSM having a general composition of (La1-xSrx)yMn03si wherein x is not greater than about 0.5, y is not greater than about 1.0, and the ratio of La/Mn is not greater than 1.0. Accordingly, the ratio of La/Mn within the LSM cathode material may be less Than about 1.0, such as less than about 0.97, 0.95 or even 0.90, Generally, a ratio of La/Mn of not greater than 1.0, and particularly less than 1.0. provides a desirable stoichiometric condition that reduces the formation of conductivity-lirnitang compositions at the cathode/electrolyte interface during operation of the SOFC, The formation of such conductivity-limiting compositions may reduce the efficiency and the operable lifetime of the SOFC.<br>
[0026] The cathode, similar to the anode, is a porous material, which aids the transport of an oxygen-rich gas through the cathode material to the cathode/electrolyte interface to fuel the reduction reaction. Generally the oxygen-rich gas is supplied to the cathode via channels. Typically the channels are positioned within close proximity to the<br><br>
cathode to provide effective transport of the oxygen-rich gas from the channels, through the porous cathode material, and ultimately to the cathode/electrolyte interface. In some embodiments, the channels are adjacent to or overlaying the cathode. In other embodiments, the channels are integrated within and extending along the cathode material,<br>
[0027} According to one embodiment, the SOFC notably comprises a buffer layer for buffering the flow of oxygen into the lanthanum manganate cathode material. The buffer layer provides a medium for metering the flow of oxygen into the cathode, thereby controlling the partial pressure of oxygen within the cathode. Controlling the partial pressure of oxygen within the cathode allows maintenance of a desirable reducing or oxidizmg environment within the cathode during the operation of the fuel cell. Maintaining a desirable partial pressure of oxygen may stabilize the cathode material and attenuate decomposition of the cathode material, which otherwise may result in the formation of undesirable conductivity-Iimitmg compositions at the cathode/electrobyte interface, thereby reducing the efficiency and lifetime of the SOFC.<br>
[0028] According to one embodiment, the buffer layer has a negative reduction potential, which during operation of the fuel cell component allows an oxidizing condition within the buffer layer. The oxidizing condition within the buffer layer reduces the partial pressure of oxygen within the cathode such that in comparison to fuel cell cathode: without a buffer layer the partial pressure of oxygen within the cathode is reduced.   This buffer layer material having may be particularly desirable to buffer the flow of oxygen into the cathode and provide a desirable environment in the cathode during operation. According to one embodiment, the buffer layer conditions the oxygen passing through the buffer layer such that the partial pressure of oxygen within the cathode is not greater than about l.Oatm. at 1000°C. As such, the partial pressure of oxygen within the cathode may be less, such as not greater than about 0.9atm, O.Satm, or even not greater than about 0.7atm.<br>
[0029] According to one embodiment, the buffer layer comprises a two-phase material. The two phases may include a metal material and a metal oxide material, such as a composition of a transition metal and a ceramic. Alternatively, the two<br><br>
phases may both comprise an oxide. Oxide materials for the buffer layer can include material such as and<br>
  According to a particular embodiment, the buffer layer can include a two-phase material in which the first phase is a ceramic oxide material that is dissimilar from the material of the cathode and the second phase is the same material as the cathode, such as a lanthanum manganate material. For clarification, a dissimilar ceramic oxide material includes an oxide material that has a different chemical composition than the chemical composition of the cathode material. In one embodiment, the buffer layer comprises a two-phase material having a general composition of The first phase of this composition is<br>
Mn305, a composition dissimilar from the lanthanum manganate cathode composition, while the second phase is a compound having the same chemical<br>
composition as the lanthanum manganate cathode material, It will be appreciated that the chemical composition of the buffer layer material that is similar to the cathode composition can include a selection of desirable compositions as previously described in accordance wiith the compositions of the cathode.<br>
[0030] In continued reference to the buffer layer, the buffer is generally positioned proximate to the flow of the oxygen-rich gas, for passage of the gas therethrough in order to buffer the flow of the gas prior to passage into the cathode. According to one embodiment, the buffer layer extends along the channels of the cathode, such as a buffer layer included in the cathode material. For example, the buffer layer may be integrated within the cathode such that the buffer layer is disposed adjacent to the channels within the cathode as a planar layer. For example, the buffer layer is a planar layer structure disposed between the channels and the bulk of cathode material. However, according to a particular embodiment, the buffer layer extends along the channels, generally surrounding a periphery of the channels. More particularly, the buffer layer may be provided to define the channels, that is, to define an interior surface of the channels through which an oxygen-rich gas flows.<br>
[0031] Referring to FIG. 1, a cross-sectional view of a planar SOFC device is illustrated in accordance with embodiments provided herein, FIG. 1 illustrates an SOFC having an anode 109 including anode channels 111 for delivering fuel gas, a cathode 101 and an electrolyte layer 107 disposed between the anode 109 and the<br><br>
cathode 1C1   The cathode 101 further includes cathode channels 103 for delivering oxygen-rich gas to the cathode 101. The cathode channels 103 include a buffer layer 105 disposed on the interior surface of the cathode channels 103 such that the buffer is positioned within the oxygen flow path. The position of the buffer layer 105 facilitates buffering the flow of oxygen to the cathode 101, thereby inhibiting the formation of conductivity-limiting compositions at the cathode/electrolyte interface 110.<br>
[0032] According to another embodiment, a fuel cell stack can be made which incorporates multiple fuel cells. Each fuel cell of the fuel cell stack has a cathode comprising a lanthanum manganate material and channels for receiving a flow of oxygen, as well as a buffer layer extending along the channels, an anode, and an electrolyte layer disposed between the cathode and the anode.<br>
[0033] FIG. 2 illustrates a fuel cell stack having a plurality of fuel cells in accordance with embodiments provided herein. According to one embodiment, the fuel cells share electrodes, such as the anode and the cathode between individual fuel cells, although other architectures may be used. The stack includes electrode layers 202, 206, 210 and 214 separated by electrolyte layers 204,208 and 212. As described in accordance with previous embodiments, each electrode layer may include channels 216 for the transport of an oxygen-rich gas or a fuel gas as described previously.<br>
[0034] In the particular embodiment illustrated, electrode 202 is an anode and electrode 206 is a cathode with electrolyte layer 204 disposed between the electrodes 202 and 204 to form a single solid oxide fuel cell. It will be appreciated that another single solid oxide fuel cell is defined by electrode 206, which as stated previously is a cathode, electrolyte layer 208 and electrode 210, which is an anode. As illustrated in the exemplary embodiment, each of the individual fuel cells shares an electrode, for example electrode 206 supplies gas to electrolyte layers 204 and 208. Additionally, electrode 210, which according to the illustrated embodiment is an anode, supplies fuel gas to electrolyte layer 208 and 212. The stack may be arranged in a repeating pattern so that several electrodes are shared among adjacent solid oxide fuel cells. Alternatively, non-shared electrode configurations may use gas-impermeab<br>
interconnect  barriers. The stack may be connected to other stacks in a series, parallel or hybrid series/parallel circuit configuration,<br><br>
[0035] In further reference to the particular embodiment of FIG. 2, a buffer layer 218 is illustrated asextending along channels2l6 of electrodes 206and 214. According to the illustrated embodiment of FIG. 2, the buffer layer defines the channels 216, that is, defines an interior surface of the channels 216 such that the buffer is positioned within the oxygen flow path- The position of the buffer layer 218 facilitates buffering the flow of oxygen to the electrodes 206 and 214.<br>
[0036] The solid oxide fuel cells described above may be incorporated into a SOFC system for producing power. FIG. 3 depicts an exemplary SOFC system. The system includes a fuel system 302, an air system 304, a SOFC stack 308, and a power conditioner 310. The system may also include a reformer 306 depending on the expected operating temperature of the SOFC stack.<br>
[0037] Fuel enters the fuel system 302. The fuel system 302 may clean the fuel and/or heat the fuel in preparation for reforming or reaction. The fuel system. 302 may include heat exchangers, compressors, pumps, absorption beds, and other components. From the fuel system 302, the fuel enters a reformer 306. The reformer 306 may use the fuel to prodo se hydrogen and other molecules. The reformer 306 is typically used for low temperature SOFC systems. High temperature SOFC systems may have the advantage of internal reforming and thus utilize tmreformed fuel.<br>
[0038] In this particular embodiment, the oxygen-rich gas is air which enters the system through die air system 304. The air system 304 may clean,, compress, purify, and/or heat the air. The air system may include compressors, absorption beds, membranes, and heat exchangers, among other components.<br>
[0039] The fuel and air are directed to the SOFC stack 308. The fuel is typically directed across the anodes of the fuel cells in the SOFC stack and the air is typically directed across the cathodes. In the case of SOFCs, oxygen ion transport across the electrolyte from the cathode to the anode produces an electric potential. This electric potential is conditioned with a power conditioner 310 that is electrically coupled to the SOFC stack 308. The power conditioner 310 may deliver power to a grid or circuitry. Exhaust from the SOFC stack may be used for heat exchange or in the reformation process.<br><br>
[0040] According to embodiments herein, the longevity of an SOFC, SOFC stack, or power system utilizing the SOFC components, may be improved and have stabilized performance. According to particular embodiments, a desirable oxidation and/or reducing environment in the cathode may be maintained to inhibit decomposition of the cathode material, which, may result in the formation of conductivity-limiting compositions at the cathode/electrolyte interface. In addition, particular compositional features in the context of various SOFC embodiments may achieve reduction in the decomposition of the cathode and the formation of conductivity-limting compositions at the cathode/electrolyte interface. For example, A-site deficient lanthanum manganate in the context of SOFC embodiments, may provide a desirable lanthanum deficiency in the cathode material thereby delaying migration of lanthanum to the cathode/electrolyte interface, which is related to decomposition of the cathode material and subsequent formation of conductivity-limiting compositions.<br>
[0041] Additionally, according to certain embodiments, combination of an A-site deficient lanthanum manganate cathode with a La/Mn ratio of less than 1.0 aids the formation of a passivation layer at the cathode/electrolyte interface, The passivation layer is a non-conductivity-limtting composition that inhibits the formation of conductivity-limiting compositions at the cathode/electroiyte interface by reducing the migration of other species (e.g.„ La) to the cathode/electrolyte interface. Additionally, the A-site defioient cathode having a La/Mn ratio less than 1,0 may further be altered to include a dopant material (e.g., Sr). The addition of a dopant material in the context of various SOFC embodiments may further inhibit formation of conductivity-limiting compositions by reducing the thermodynamically-driven migration of certain species to the cathode/electrolyte interface to form conductivity-limiting compositions. According to certain embodiments, the combination- of the buffer layer with particular cathode compositions is notable, and functions to reduce the fbrmatioa of conductivity-limiting compositions by maintaining a desirable partial pressure of oxygen (oxidizing/reducing environment) within the cathode, reducing the thermodynamically-driven migration of certain species to the cathode/electrolyte interface, and forming of a passivation layer at the camode/eiectrolyte interface during operation of the SOFC to curtail the formation of conductivity-limiting compositions.<br><br>
