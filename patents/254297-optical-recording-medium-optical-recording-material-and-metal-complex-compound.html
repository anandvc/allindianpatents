DESCRIPTION<br>
Technical Field<br>
[0001]<br>
The present invention relates to an optical recording medium and<br>
others, and more specifically, to an optical recording medium and others<br>
applicable to blue laser, having an excellent light resistance.<br>
Background Art<br>
[0002]<br>
Presently, various kinds of optical recording media including<br>
CD-R/RW, DVD-R/RW, MO and others have been widely accepted and used<br>
as external memory devices for information processing machines such as<br>
computers because a large quantity of information may be stored and<br>
randomly accessed easily as in DVD-RAM. Among the optical recording<br>
media, recordable optical recording media such as CD-R and DVD-R, which<br>
are organic dye type optical recording media having a recording layer<br>
containing organic dye compounds, have been considered to have<br>
advantages from the viewpoint of low cost and easy production.<br>
Generally, the optical recording media such as CD-R and DVD-R that<br>
are available in the market are designed as, for example, in the case of<br>
CD-R, being suitable for recording and reading information with a laser light<br>
of about 780 nm wavelength, or in the case of DVD-R, being suitable for<br>
recording and reading information with a laser light of 600 nm to 700 nm<br>
wavelength. As a dye used for recording in CD-R or DVD-R, for example,<br><br>
an azo compound is used (refer to Patent Document 1, Patent Document 2,<br>
and Patent Document 3).<br>
[0003]<br>
Patent Document 1: International Publication No. WO 91/018950,<br>
Patent Document 2: Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open<br>
Publication No. H09-277703, and<br>
Patent Document 3: Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open ,..<br>
Publication No. 2001-271001.<br>
Disclosure of the Invention<br>
Problems to be Solved by the Invention<br>
[0004]<br>
Meanwhile, due to the increase in information quantity handled, the<br>
recording density of the media has been requested to be increased. In<br>
particular, in recent years, by using a laser light with a short oscillation<br>
wavelength such as a blue laser that has been developed intensively, an<br>
optical recording medium having a capability of recording and reading<br>
information at a high density has been proposed.<br>
In view of such request, when conventional optical recording media<br>
that optically record and read information using a laser light with a<br>
relatively long wavelength are applied to recording and reading information<br>
using a laser light with a shorter wavelength, the reflectance is lowered and<br>
recording or reading is not performed adequately.<br>
[0005]<br>
For example, in the optical recording medium described in the<br>
aforementioned Patent Document 1, an azo compound having a coupler<br>
component with an N,N-dialkylaniline structure is used as a dye for<br>
recording. With the N,N-dialkylaniline structure, a dye having an<br><br>
extremely large molar absorption coefficient is likely to be obtained.<br>
However, in an absorption spectrum in a solution of an azo metal chelate<br>
compound that is a complex between the foregoing azo compound and a<br>
metal, Amax is observed at 500 nm or longer. Thereby, in an absorption<br>
spectrum of a coating film that contains the dye of the foregoing<br>
metal-containing azo complex compound, almost no absorption is observed<br>
at around 405 nm wavelength of laser light. The problem is that the<br>
coating film is likely to have poor sensitivity to blue laser light.<br>
[0006]<br>
Further, in the optical recording medium described in Patent<br>
Document 2, an azo compound having a coupler component with a pyridone<br>
structure is used as a dye for recording. The absorption spectrum of the<br>
azo compound has been known to exhibit Amax at a shorter wavelength, but<br>
the absorption spectrum of a metal chelate compound composed of a metal<br>
and an azo compound having a benzothiazole or thiazole structure as the<br>
diazo component has small absorption at around the laser light wavelength<br>
of 405 nm.<br>
[0007]<br>
Further, in Patent Document 3, a metal-containing azo complex<br>
compound that is a complex between a metal and an azo compound having<br>
as the coupler component a linear β-diketone structure including a<br>
β-ketoester and the like is reported to have absorption in the short<br>
wavelength side in an absorption spectrum. However, the azo compound<br>
having the linear β-diketone structure as the coupler component has<br>
production problems to be improved such as low yield of synthesis,<br>
difficulty in solidification, and low purity of the resulting product, requiring<br>
further studies.<br><br>
[0008]<br>
Further, the present inventors have reported in Japanese Patent<br>
Application No. 2005-95905 that a metal azo chelate dye composed of a<br>
metal and an azo compound having a diazo component such as isoxazole<br>
having absorption in the short wavelength side and a coupler component<br>
such as pyridone has absorption in the blue light region that corresponds to<br>
350 nm to 530 nm of laser light wavelength. However, further studies have<br>
shown that the foregoing azo compound has a limitation on molecular<br>
designing because the optimum combination of the coupler component and<br>
diazo component is limited, so that further shifting to the shorter<br>
wavelength side is difficult considering the molecular structure thereof. In<br>
addition, it has been also found that the light resistance of the azo<br>
compound containing isoxazole as the diazo component is required to be<br>
improved.<br>
[0009]<br>
The present invention has been made to address the aforementioned<br>
problems that have been highlighted in the course of the development of an<br>
optical recording medium that records and/or reads high density optical<br>
information using a blue laser light of short wavelength.<br>
Namely, it is an object of the present invention to provide an optical<br>
recording medium having a capability of recording and/or reading high<br>
density optical information using a laser light of short wavelength.<br>
Further, it is another object of the present invention to provide an<br>
optical recording material having a capability of recording optical<br>
information using a laser light of short wavelength.<br>
Still further, it is another object of the present invention to provide a<br>
metal complex compound useful as an optical recording material.<br><br>
Means for solving the problems<br>
[0010]<br>
The present inventors have made intensive studies and found that a<br>
diazo compound having a cyclic p-diketone structure as a coupler<br>
component exhibits a high sensitivity absorption in the short wavelength<br>
side. The present invention has been accomplished based on this finding.<br>
According to the present invention, there is provided an optical<br>
recording medium characterized by comprising a substrate and a recording<br>
layer provided on the substrate directly or on other layers provided on the<br>
substrate, having a capability of recording and/or reading information by<br>
irradiating light thereon wherein the recording layer contains a metal<br>
complex compound composed of an azo compound and a metal ion. The<br>
azo compound has a coupler component with a cyclic p-diketone structure<br>
and a diazo component with a nitrogen-containing heterocyclic aromatic<br>
ring structure. The metal ion is coordinated by the azocompound.<br>
[0011]<br>
The optical recording medium according to the present invention is<br>
not limited as long as the azo compound that composes the metal complex<br>
compound contained in the recording layer has a coupler component with a<br>
cyclic β-diketone structure and a diazo component with a<br>
nitrogen-containing heterocyclic aromatic ring structure, but the coupler<br>
component preferably has a structure of five- to seven-membered ring from<br>
the viewpoint of stability and easiness of the synthesis of the compound.<br>
Particularly preferable is a cyclic p-diketone azo compound represented by<br>
the following general formula (I) or general formula (II). By incorporating<br>
the cyclic p-diketone azo compound into the recording layer, an optical<br>
recording medium having a capability of recording and/or reading high<br><br>
density optical information using a laser light of short wavelength may be<br>
attained.<br>
[0012]<br><br>
[0013]<br>
(in the general formula (I) or (II), ring A is a nitrogen-containing<br>
heterocyclic aromatic ring; X, Y, and Z in the general formula (I) and X' and<br>
Y' in the general formula (II) each independently are one kind selected from<br>
an optionally substituted carbon atom, an oxygen atom, a sulfur atom, and<br>
a nitrogen atom and form a five-membered or a six-membered ring together<br>
with a β-diketone structure.)<br>
The coupler component for the cyclic β-diketone azo compound<br>
preferably has a cyclic β-diketone structure having a saturated or<br>
unsaturated five- to seven-membered hydrocarbon ring or a heterocyclic<br>
condensed ring.<br>
[0014]<br>
The diazo component preferably has a nitrogen-containing<br>
heterocyclic aromatic ring structure composed of a five- or six-membered<br>
monocyclic or a dicyclic condensed ring of either or both of a five-membered<br>
ring and a six-membered ring.<br><br>
Further, the metal ion is preferably an ion of a divalent metal selected<br>
from Groups 7A, 8, 1B, and 2B in the periodic table, particularly preferably<br>
an ion of at least one kind of metal selected from nickel, cobalt, zinc,<br>
copper, and manganese.<br>
[0015]<br>
The optical recording medium according to the present invention has<br>
a recording layer containing the complex composed of the azo compound<br>
having the aforementioned cyclic p-diketone structure and a metal, so that<br>
the optical recording medium is capable of recording information using a<br>
laser light of 350 nm to 530 nm wavelength.<br>
[0016]<br>
Further, according to the present invention, there is provided an<br>
optical recording material that contains a metal-containing cyclic p-diketone<br>
azo compound and, if necessary, the other ingredients.	The<br>
metal-containing cyclic p-diketone azo compound is composed of an azo<br>
compound and a metal ion. The azo compound has a coupler component<br>
with a cyclic β-diketone structure and a diazo component with a<br>
nitrogen-containing heterocyclic aromatic ring structure. The metal ion is<br>
coordinated by the azo compound.<br>
Still further, in the metal complex compound composed of an azo<br>
compound having a cyclic β-diketone structure linked to an azo group and a<br>
nitrogen-containing heterocyclic aromatic ring, and a divalent metal ion, the<br>
cyclic β-diketone structure preferably has any structure selected from<br>
Meldrum's acid, tetronic acid, barbituric acid, thiobarbituric acid,<br>
hydroxycoumarin, hydroxycarbostyril, pyrazolidinedione, indandione,<br>
cyclohexanedione, and diketopyrimidine.<br>
Effect of the Invention<br><br>
[0017]<br>
According to the present invention, an optical recording medium<br>
having a capability of recording and/or reading high density optical<br>
information using a laser light of short wavelength is provided.<br>
Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
[0018]<br>
Hereinafter, a best mode for carrying out the present invention<br>
(hereinafter, abbreviated as embodiment) will be explained in detail.<br>
However, the present invention is not limited by the embodiment and may<br>
be performed in various forms within the scope of the present invention.<br>
Further, the accompanying drawings are used to explain the embodiment of<br>
the present invention, but do not show actual sizes.<br>
Further, in the embodiment of the present invention, R1 to R25 defined<br>
in the structural formula described later may optionally have a substituent.<br>
Note that, the "substituent" used in the description of "substituent",<br>
"optionally substituted", and "optionally have a substituent" does not<br>
include a water-soluble group such as a carboxyl group, a sulfonic acid<br>
group and the like.<br>
[0019]<br>
(Azo Compound)<br>
The cyclic β-diketone azo compound (hereinafter, simply mentioned as<br>
"azo compound" in some cases) used in the present embodiment is not<br>
limited as long as the azo compound has a coupler component with a cyclic<br>
β-diketone structure and a diazo component with a nitrogen-containing<br>
heterocyclic aromatic ring structure, but preferably as described above may<br>
have the structure represented by the following general formula (I) or<br>
general formula (II). In the general formula (I) or general formula (II),<br><br>
generally the nitrogen-containing heterocyclic aromatic ring positioned on<br>
the left side of an azo group (-N=N-) is called the diazo component, and the<br>
cyclic β-diketone structure on the right side is called the coupler<br>
component. The structure represented by the general formula (I) or general<br>
formula (II) may form a keto-enol tautomeric structure. For example, the<br>
structure represented by the general formula (I) may form the following<br>
structure. In the present description, the keto-enol tautomeric structure is<br>
represented by the enol form because a hydrogen atom is eliminated from<br>
the enol form and the resulting -O- form coordinates to the metal ion when<br>
the complex is formed.<br><br><br>
(Coupler Component)<br>
Firstly, the coupler component will be explained.<br>
In the coupler component of an azo compound represented by the<br>
general formula (I) or general formula (II), X, X', Y, Y', and Z each<br>
independently represent any one of a carbon atom that optionally has a<br>
substituent except a hydrogen atom, an oxygen atom, a sulfur atom, a<br>
nitrogen atom represented by N-R1, C=O, C=S, and C=NR2, and form a cyclic<br>
P-diketone structure having a five- or six-membered ring structure together<br>
with a 3-diketone structure. R1 represents any one of a hydrogen atom, a<br>
linear or branched alkyl group, a cycloalkyl group, an aralkyl group, an aryl<br>
group, a heterocyclic group, an acyl group represented by -COR3, and an<br>
amino group represented by -NR4R5. R2 represents a hydrogen atom, a<br>
linear or branched alkyl group, or an aryl group. R3 represents a<br>
hydrocarbon group or a heterocyclic group. R4 and R5 each represent a<br>
hydrogen atom, a hydrocarbon atom, or a heterocyclic group. The alkyl<br>
chain moiety thereof or the alkyl chain moiety of the aralkyl group is<br>
optionally substituted by the same substituent as the aforementioned<br>
substituted alkyl chain.<br>
[0023]<br>
A specific example of the cyclic p-diketone structure may be a<br>
structure represented by, for example, cyclohexanedione, Meldrum's acid,<br>
cyclopentadione, pyrazolidinedione, tetronic acid, tetramic acid, barbituric<br>
acid,	thiobarbituric	acid,	indandione,	4-hydroxy-a-pyrone,<br>
4-hydroxy-a-pyridone, 4-hydroxycoumarin, 4-hydroxycarbostyril, or the<br>
like.<br>
[0024]<br>
The combinations or positions of X, X', Y, Y' and Z are not<br><br>
particularly limited, but when each member is linked together with a single<br>
bond, for example, there may be mentioned the following structures.<br>
[0025]<br><br><br>
When X, X', Y, Y', and Z each represent a carbon atom, each<br>
optionally has an alkyl chain as the substituent except a hydrogen atom.<br>
The alkyl chain may be one kind, two of the same kind, or a combination of<br>
different kinds. In addition, X, X', Y, Y', and Z optionally form a spiro ring<br>
at the terminal carbon atoms. Examples of such structures are shown<br>
below, where an alkyl chain is incorporated as a substituent when an<br>
oxygen atom is selected as X and Z and a carbon atom is selected as Y.<br>
[0027]<br>
[Chemical 5]<br><br>
[0028]<br>
The alkyl chain incorporated as a substituent preferably has from 1<br>
to 16 carbon atoms. When the alkyl chain incorporated as a substituent<br>
is excessively long, the resulting product is likely not to easily solidify and<br>
the gram absorption coefficient that represents absorption per weight is<br>
likely to decrease.<br>
[0029]<br>
Further, when X, X', Y, Y', and Z each are a carbon atom or a<br>
nitrogen atom represented by N-R1, adjacent atoms are optionally linked by<br>
a single bond or a double bond. Such structure having an unsaturated<br>
bonding may include, for example, the following structures.<br>
[0030]<br>
[Chemical 6]<br><br><br>
[0031]<br>
Further, when X, X', Y, Y', and Z are each a carbon atom, a nitrogen<br>
atom represented by N-R1, or C=NR2, adjacent atoms are optionally<br>
condensed with each other and form a saturated or unsaturated<br>
hydrocarbon ring or heterocyclic ring. Such a structure may include, for<br>
example, the following structures.<br>
[0032]<br>
[Chemical 7]<br><br><br>
[0033]<br>
Among the above condensed structures, there may be mentioned<br>
preferably a saturated or unsaturated five- to seven-membered<br>
hydrocarbon ring or heterocyclic ring, particularly preferably a saturated or<br>
unsaturated six-membered hydrocarbon ring in which every X, X', Y, Y',<br>
and Z adjacent to each other is a carbon at0m.<br>
[0034]<br>
A particularly preferable structure represented by such X, X', Y, Y',<br>
and Z may include the structures shown in the following list:<br>
cyclohexanedione, Meldrum's acid, cyclopentadione, pyrazolidinedione,<br>
tetronic acid, tetramic acid, barbituric acid, thiobarbituric acid,<br>
indandione, 4-hydroxy-a-pyrone, 4-hydroxy-α-pyridone, diketopyrimidine,<br>
4-hydroxycoumarin, and 4-hydroxycarbostyril.<br>
[0035]<br><br><br>
[0036]<br>
(Diazo Component)<br>
The diazo component is explained below.<br>
In the general formula (I) or general formula (II), the ring A in the<br>
diazo component represents a nitrogen-containing heterocyclic aromatic<br>
ring formed by including the carbon atom and nitrogen atom bonding to<br>
the ring A. The structure of the nitrogen-containing heterocyclic aromatic<br><br>
ring may be a monocyclic or a condensed ring as long as the structure has<br>
a nitrogen atom at the position having a coordination capability. The<br>
aromatic ring may include, for example, the following nitrogen-containing<br>
heterocyclic aromatic rings.<br>
[0037]<br><br><br>
[0038]<br>
In the nitrogen-containing heterocyclic aromatic ring described<br>
above, D1 to D9 each independently represent any one of a hydrogen atom,<br>
a linear or branched C1-C6 alkyl group, a C3-C9 cycloalkyl group, a<br>
C7-C12 aralkyl group, and an acyl group represented by-COR3.<br>
[0039]<br>
Among the structures described above, in view of the absorption<br>
wavelength or solubility, the structure for the ring A is preferably a<br>
nitrogen-containing heterocyclic aromatic ring composed of a five- or<br>
six-membered monocyclic or a dicyclic condensed ring of either or both of a<br>
five-membered ring and a six-membered ring. Particularly preferably,<br>
there may be mentioned isoxazole, triazole, oxazole, thiadiazole, pyrazole,<br>
pyridine, pyrimidine, imidazole, thiazole, isothiazole, benzothiazole,<br>
benzisoxazole, benzoxazole, and benzimidazole.<br>
[0040]<br>
In the general formula (I) or general formula (II), the ring A may have<br>
any substituent except a hydrogen atom. As an example of the<br>
substituent, there may be mentioned the following groups: for example, an<br>
optionally substituted C1-C18 linear or branched alkyl group such as<br>
methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, sec-butyl, tert-butyl, n-hepryl and<br>
the like; an optionally substituted C3-C18 cycloalkyl group such as<br>
cyclopropyl, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, adamantyl and the like; an optionally<br>
substituted C2-C18 linear or branched alkenyl group such as vinyl,<br>
propenyl, hexenyl and the like; an optionally substituted C3-C18<br>
cycloalkenyl group such as cyclopentenyl, cyclohexenyl and the like; an<br>
optionally substituted saturated or unsaturated heterocyclic group such as<br>
2-thienyl, 2-pyridyl, 4-piperidyl, morpholino and the like; an optionally<br><br>
substituted C6-C18 aryl group such as phenyl, tolyl, xylyl, mesityl,<br>
naphthyl and the like; an optionally substituted C7-C20 aralkyl group<br>
such as benzyl, phenethyl and the like; an optionally substituted C1-C18<br>
linear or branched alkoxy group such as methoxy, ethoxy, n-propoxy,<br>
isopropoxy, n-butoxy, sec-butoxy, tert-butoxy and the like; an optionally<br>
substituted C3-C18 linear or branched alkenyloxy group such as<br>
propenyloxy, butenyloxy, pentenyloxy and the like; an optionally<br>
substituted C1-C18 linear or branched alkylthio group such as methylthio,<br>
ethylthio, n-propylthio, n-butylthio, sec-butylthio, tert-butylthio and the<br>
like; and others.<br>
[0041]<br>
Further, other specific examples include a halogen atom such as<br>
fluorine, chlorine, bromine and the like; a nitro group; a cyano group; a<br>
mercapto group; a hydroxyl group; a formyl group; an acyl group<br>
represented by -COR3; an amino group represented by -NR4R5; an<br>
acylamino group represented by -NHCOR6; a carbamate group represented<br>
by -NHCOOR7; a carboxylate group represented by -COOR8; an acyloxy<br>
group represented by -OCOR9; a carbamoyl group represented by<br>
-CONR10R11; a sulfonyl group represented by -SO2R12; a sulfinyl group<br>
represented by -SOR13; a sulfamoyl group represented by -SO2NR14R15; a<br>
sulfonate group represented by -SO3R16; and a sulfone-amide group<br>
represented by -NHSO2R17. The bonding position of the foregoing<br>

[0072]<br>
The molecular weight of the azo compound represented by the general<br>
formula (I) or general formula (II) is preferably 1,000 or less and particularly<br>
preferably 700 or less. Too large molecular weight is rather undesirable<br>
because the gram absorption coefficient is lowered and the absorption<br>
becomes low with respect to the amount of the dye.<br>
As a preferable example of the azo compound represented by the<br>
general formula (I) or general formula (II), there may be mentioned the<br>
following compounds of (1) to (189).<br>

[0090]<br>
(Metal)<br>
Hereinafter, there will be explained the metal that forms, by<br>
coordinating with the azo compound represented by the general formula (I)<br>
or general formula (II), the metal-containing cyclic β-diketone azo compound<br><br>
that is a metal complex compound.<br>
As the metal that forms, by coordinating with the azo compound<br>
represented by the general formula (I) or general formula (II), the<br>
metal-containing cyclic β-diketone azo compound, any kind of metal may be<br>
selected without limitation as long as the metal has a capability of<br>
coordination with the azo compound. There may be selected a transition<br>
element or a representative element, that may have any oxidation number.<br>
The ratio between the metal and the azo compound is not particularly<br>
limited in the metal-containing cyclic β-diketone azo compound. The<br>
complex may contain a charged counter ion besides the azo compound and<br>
the metal. The metal may include, for example, a metal selected from<br>
Group 7A, 8, 1B, and 2B in the periodic table. Among these metals, nickel,<br>
cobalt, copper, iron, zinc, manganese, platinum, palladium, and the like are<br>
preferably selected.<br>
[0091]<br>
(Metal Complex Compound)<br>
As mentioned above, the azo compound represented by the general<br>
formula (I) or general formula (II) forms a metal complex compound by<br>
coordinating with the metal that has a capability of being coordinated with<br>
the azo compound. In terms of the easiness of forming the complex, the<br>
complex structure formed from the azo compound and the metal is<br>
preferably the structure (hexa-coordinated structure) formed by<br>
coordination of two azo compounds to one divalent transition metal because<br>
the azo compound easily transforms into a tridentate ligand having minus<br>
one charge. In particular, a coordinated structure with a divalent<br>
transition metal such as nickel, cobalt, copper, iron, zinc, and manganese is<br>
preferable. Further, plural kinds of the azo compounds may coordinate to<br><br>
the metal as a ligand to form the metal-containing cyclic p-diketone azo<br>
compound. Still further, plural kinds of the metal-containing cyclic<br>
β-diketone azo compounds may be contained in the recording layer.<br>
[0092]<br>
As the metal complex compound, there may be mentioned, for<br>
example, the following compounds: a metal complex compound having as a<br>
ligand an azo compound composed of a coupler component based on<br>
Meldrum's acid and a diazo component selected from isoxazole,<br>
benzisoxazole, pyrazole, triazole, imidazole, benzimidazole, thiazole,<br>
benzothiazolethiadiazole, and pyridine; a metal complex compound having<br>
as a ligand an azo compound composed of a coupler component based on<br>
tetronic acid and a diazo component selected from isoxazole, benzisoxazole,<br>
pyrazole, triazole, imidazole, benzimidazole, thiazole, benzothiazole,<br>
thiadiazole, and pyridine; a metal complex compound having as a ligand an<br>
azo compound composed of a coupler component based on<br>
hydroxycoumarin and a diazo component selected from isoxazole,<br>
benzisoxazole, pyrazole, triazole, imidazole, benzimidazole, thiazole,<br>
benzothiazole, thiadiazole, and pyridine; a metal complex compound having<br>
as a ligand an azo compound composed of a coupler component based on<br>
hydroxycarbostyril and a diazo component selected from isoxazole,<br>
benzisoxazole, pyrazole, triazole, imidazole, benzimidazole, thiazole,<br>
benzothiazole, thiadiazole, and pyridine; a metal complex compound having<br>
as a ligand an azo compound composed of a coupler component based on<br>
indandione and a diazo component selected from isoxazole, benzisoxazole,<br>
pyrazole, triazole, and benzimidazole; a metal complex compound having as<br>
a ligand an azo compound composed of a coupler component based on<br>
barbituric acid and a diazo component selected from isoxazole,<br><br>
benzisoxazole, pyrazole, triazole, and benzimidazole; and a metal complex<br>
compound having as a ligand an azo compound composed of a coupler<br>
component based on thiobarbituric acid and a diazo component selected<br>
from isoxazole, benzisoxazole, pyrazole, triazole, and benzimidazole. By<br>
selecting appropriately the combination of the diazo component and the<br>
coupler component, the wavelength of the absorption band, absorbance,<br>
and solubility of the metal complex compound may be conditioned at<br>
desired values.<br>
[0093]<br>
(Optical Recording Medium)<br>
Hereinafter, the optical recording medium to which the present<br>
embodiment is applied is explained. The optical recording medium in<br>
accordance with the present embodiment has at least a substrate and a<br>
recording layer that contains a metal-containing cyclic β-diketone azo<br>
compound given by coordinating a metal to an azo compound represented<br>
by the general formula (I) or general formula (II) (hereinafter, in some cases<br>
simply described as "metal-containing cyclic β-diketone azo compound").<br>
If necessary, an underlying layer, a reflection layer, a protection layer, and<br>
others may be further provided.<br>
[0094]<br>
FIGURE 1 shows a first embodiment of an optical recording medium<br>
100 to which the present embodiment (CD-R is shown in the embodiment)<br>
is applied. The optical recording medium 100 shown in FIG. 1 has a<br>
substrate 10 made of a transparent material and has a guide groove 11<br>
and an information recording layer 20 disposed on the substrate 10. The<br>
information recording layer 20 is composed of a recording layer 21 having a<br>
reflection layer 22 and a protection layer 23 that are laminated in this<br><br>
order on the recording layer 21. The optical recording medium 100 has a<br>
capability of recording and/or reading information by laser light irradiated<br>
from the side of the substrate 10. For the convenience of explanation, in<br>
the optical recoding medium 100, the side where the protection layer 23 is<br>
disposed is called as upper, and the side where the substrate 10 is<br>
disposed is called as lower. Each face of each layer corresponding to the<br>
foregoing upper and lower directions is called as the upper or lower face of<br>
each layer.<br>
[0095]<br>
(Substrate 10)<br>
For the substrate 10, various kinds of materials can be used as long<br>
as the material is basically transparent at the wavelengths of recording<br>
light and reading light. Specifically, there may be mentioned resins such<br>
as acrylic, methacrylic, polycarbonate, polyolefin (especially, amorphous<br>
polyolefin), polyester, polystyrene, epoxy and the like; and glass. In<br>
addition, there may be mentioned a structure having a resin layer of a<br>
radiation curable resin such as a photo-curable resin on a glass substrate.<br>
Among the materials, considering high productivity, cost, moisture<br>
resistance and the like, polycarbonate resin used by injection molding is<br>
preferable. Considering chemical and moisture resistances, amorphous<br>
polyolefin is preferable. Further, considering fast response performance<br>
and the like, glass is preferable. In the case where the substrate 10 made<br>
of a resin is used or where the substrate 10 having a resin layer on the side<br>
(upper side) contacting the recording layer 21 is used, guide grooves or pits<br>
for recording and reading light may be formed on the upper face. As the<br>
shape of the guide groove, there may be mentioned a concentric ring form<br>
and a spiral form having the same center with the optical recording<br><br>
medium 100. In the case of the guide groove having a spiral form, the<br>
groove pitch is preferably around 0.2 µm to 1.2 µm.<br>
[0096]<br>
(Recording Layer 21)<br>
The recording layer 21 is formed directly on the upper side of the<br>
substrate 10, or if necessary, on the upper side of an underlying layer and<br>
the like disposed on the substrate 10, and contains the metal-containing<br>
cyclic β-diketone azo compound given by coordinating metal to an azo<br>
compound represented by the general formula (I) or general formula (II).<br>
As the method of forming the recording layer 21, there may be mentioned<br>
various conventional thin film forming processes including vacuum<br>
deposition method, sputtering method, doctor-blade method, casting<br>
method, spin-coating method, dipping method, and the like. The<br>
spin-coating method is preferred in terms of mass productivity and cost,<br>
while the vacuum deposition method or the like is more preferred than<br>
coating method in terms of obtaining the recording layer 21 with a uniform<br>
thickness. In the case of film forming process using spin-coating, the<br>
number of revolutions is preferably 500 rpm to 15,000 rpm. Further, if<br>
necessary, after spin-coating, additional treatments such as heating and<br>
exposure to solvent vapor may be performed.<br>
[0097]<br>
In the case of forming the recording layer 21 using the coating<br>
process such as doctor-blade coating, casting, spin-coating, and dipping,<br>
any coating solvent used to dissolve and coat the metal-containing cyclic<br>
β-diketone azo compound on the substrate 10 may be used without any<br>
particular limitations as long as the coating solvent does not erode the<br>
substrate 10. Specifically, there may be mentioned, for example, ketone<br><br>
alcohols such as diacetone alcohol, 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-2-butanone and<br>
the like; cellosolves such as methylcellosolve, ethylcellosolve and the like;<br>
linear hydrocarbons such as n-hexane, n-octane and the like; cyclic<br>
hydrocarbons such as cyclohexane, methyl cyclohexane, ethyl cyclohexane,<br>
dimethyl cyclohexane, n-butyl cyclohexane, tert-butyl cyclohexane,<br>
cyclooctane and the like; perfluoroalkylalcohols such as<br>
tetrafluoropropanol, octafluoropentanol, hexafluorobutanol and the like;<br>
hydroxycarboxylates such as methyl lactate, ethyl lactate, methyl<br>
2-hydroxyisolactate and the like; and others.<br>
[0098]<br>
In the case of using the vacuum deposition process, for example,<br>
recording layer components including the metal-containing cyclic<br>
β-diketone azo compound and if necessary other dyes or various kinds of<br>
additives are put in a crucible placed in a vacuum chamber; the inside of<br>
the vacuum chamber is evacuated to a pressure of 10-2 Pa to 10-5 Pa with<br>
an appropriate vacuum pump; the crucible is heated to evaporate and<br>
deposit the recording layer components on a substrate placed to face the<br>
crucible. In this way, the recording layer 21 is formed.<br>
[0099]<br>
Further, in the recording layer 21, in addition to the<br>
metal-containing cyclic β-diketone azo compound, for the purpose of<br>
improving stability and light resistance, there may be contained various<br>
additives including, for example, a singlet-oxygen quencher such as a<br>
transition metal chelate compound (for example, acetylacetonate chelate,<br>
bisphenyldithiol, salicylaldehyde-oxime, bisdithio-a-diketone and the like),<br>
still further, for the purpose of improving recording sensitivity, there may<br>
be contained a recording sensitivity improver such as a metal compound.<br><br>
The metal compound refers to a compound that contains a metal such as a<br>
transition metal in the form of atoms, ions, or clusters, including, for<br>
example, an organometallic compound such as an ethylenediamine<br>
complex, an azomethine complex, a phenylhydroxyamine complex, a<br>
phenanthroline complex, a dihydroxyazobenzene complex, a dioxime<br>
complex, a nitrosoaminophenol complex, a pyridyltriazine complex, an<br>
acetylacetonate complex, a metallocene complex, and a porphyrin complex.<br>
The metal atom is not particularly limited, but preferably a transition<br>
metal.<br>
[0100]<br>
In addition, in the recording layer 21, if necessary, plural kinds of<br>
the metal-containing cyclic β-diketone azo compounds may be used in<br>
combination. Further, besides the metal-containing cyclic p-diketone azo<br>
compound, if necessary, the other kinds of dyes may be used in<br>
combination. The other kinds of dyes are not particularly limited as long<br>
as the dyes have an adequate absorption in the oscillation wavelength<br>
range of a laser light used for recording. Further, there may be<br>
incorporated in the recording layer 21 together with the metal-containing<br>
cyclic β-diketone azo compound, a dye used for CD-R and the like and has<br>
an adequate performance for recording and reading using a nearinfrared<br>
laser light having an oscillation wavelength in the range of 770 nm to 830<br>
nm, or a dye used for DVD-R and the like and has an adequate<br>
performance for recording and reading using a red laser light having an<br>
oscillation wavelength in the range of 620 nm to 690 nm. In this way, the<br>
optical recording medium 100 that meets the recording and reading using<br>
plural kinds of laser lights belonging to different wavelength ranges may be<br>
produced.<br><br>
[0101]<br>
The other kinds of dyes besides the metal-containing cyclic<br>
β-diketone azo compound may include a metal-containing azo dye, a<br>
benzophenone dye, a phthalocyanine dye, a naphthalocyanine dye, a<br>
cyanine dye, an azo dye, a squarylium dye, a metal-containing indoaniline<br>
dye, a triarylmethane dye, a merocyanine dye, an azulenium dye, a<br>
naphthoquinone dye, an anthraquinone dye, an indophenol dye, a<br>
xanthene dye, an oxazine dye, a pyrilium dye, and the like.<br>
[0102]<br>
Still further, if necessary, a binder, a leveling agent, a defoaming<br>
agent, and the like may be used in combination. A preferable binder may<br>
include polyvinylalcohol, polyvinylpyrrolidone, nitrocellulose, cellulose<br>
acetate, a ketone resin, an acrylic resin, a polystyrene resin, a urethane<br>
resin, polyvinylburyral, polycarbonate, polyolefin, and the like.<br>
[0103]<br>
The thickness of the recording layer 21 is not particularly limited<br>
because a suitable thickness differs depending on recording methods and<br>
others, but is generally at least 1 nm or more and preferably 5 nm or more<br>
because a certain thickness is required for recording. However, adequate<br>
recording may not be attained when the thickness is too large, so that the<br>
thickness is generally 300 nm or less, preferably 200 nm or less, and more<br>
preferably 100 nm or less.<br>
[0104]<br>
The reflection layer 22 is formed on the recording layer 21. The<br>
thickness of the reflection layer 22 is preferably 50 nm to 300 nm. As the<br>
material for the reflection layer 22, a material having a sufficiently high<br>
reflectance at the wavelength of light used for reading may be used. For<br><br>
example, there may be used a metal such as Au, Al, Ag, Cu, Ti, Cr, Ni, Pt,<br>
Ta, Pd, and others, solely or as an alloy. Among the metals, Au, Al, and<br>
Ag have a high reflectance and are suitable for the reflection layer 22.<br>
Further, other materials may be incorporated in the above metals that are<br>
used as a main component. Here, the main component is defined as the<br>
one that has a content of 50% or more.<br>
[0105]<br>
The other materials besides the main component may include, for<br>
example, a metal or a semimetal such as Mg, Se, Hf, V, Nb, Ru, W, Mn, Re,<br>
Fe, Co, Rh, Ir, Cu, Zn, Cd, Ga, In, Si, Ge, Te, Pb, Po, Sn, Bi, Ta, Ti, Pt, Pd,<br>
Nd and the like. Among the above other materials, a material containing<br>
Ag as a main component is particularly preferable from the viewpoint of<br>
low cost, easily providing high reflectance, attaining a clean white ground<br>
color when a printing receiving layer mentioned later is disposed, and<br>
others.<br>
[0106]<br>
For example, an alloy containing Ag and 0.1 atom% to 5 atom% of at<br>
least one kind of metal selected from Au, Pd, Pt, Cu, and Nd is desirable<br>
because the alloy provides high reflectance, high durability, and high<br>
sensitivity with low cost. Specifically, for example, there may be<br>
mentioned an Ag-Pd-Cu alloy, an Ag-Cu-Au alloy, an Ag-Cu-Au-Nd alloy,<br>
an Ag-Cu-Nd alloy, and the like. As a material other than a metal, a<br>
multi-layered film given by stacking alternatively a low refraction thin film<br>
and a high refraction thin film may be used as the reflection layer 22.<br>
[0107]<br>
As the method of forming the reflection layer 22, there may be<br>
mentioned a process such as sputtering, ion-plating, chemical vapor<br><br>
deposition, vacuum deposition and the like. Further, on the substrate 10<br>
or under the reflection layer 22, for the purpose of increasing reflectance,<br>
improving recording performance, and improving adhesion, a known<br>
inorganic or organic intermediate or adhesive layer may be disposed.<br>
[0108]<br>
The protection layer 23 is formed on the reflection layer 22. The<br>
material for the protection layer 23 is not particularly limited as long as the<br>
material has a capability of protecting the reflection layer 22 against<br>
external forces. As an organic material, there may be mentioned a<br>
thermoplastic resin, a thermosetting resin, an electron beam curable resin,<br>
a UV light curable resin, and the like.<br>
[0109]<br>
As an inorganic material, there may be mentioned silicon oxide,<br>
silicon nitride, MgF2, SnCO2, and the like. In the case of using the<br>
thermoplastic resin or thermosetting resin, a coating solution prepared by<br>
dissolving the resin in an appropriate solvent is coated on the reflection<br>
layer 22 and dried to form the protection layer 23. In the case of using the<br>
UV light curable resin, the resin is coated as it is on the reflection layer 22,<br>
or a coating solution prepared by dissolving the resin in an appropriate<br>
solvent is coated on the reflection layer 22, and then the coating is cured<br>
by irradiating UV light thereon, so that the protection layer 23 may be<br>
formed.<br>
[0110]<br>
As the UV light curable resin, for example, there may be used an<br>
acrylate resin such as urethane aerylate, epoxy aerylate, polyester acrylate<br>
and the like. The foregoing materials may be used alone or in a<br>
combination of two or more kinds. Further, the protection layer may be a<br><br>
single layer or a multiple layer.<br>
[0111]<br>
As the method of forming the protection layer 23, similarly to the<br>
recording layer 21, a coating process such as spin-coating and casting,<br>
sputtering, chemical vapor deposition or the like may be used, and<br>
spin-coating is preferable in particular. The thickness of the protection<br>
layer 23 is generally 0.1 µm or more and preferably 3 µm or more because<br>
a certain thickness is required to provide an adequate protection effect.<br>
However, the thickness is generally 100 µm or less and preferably 30 µm<br>
or less because, when the protection layer 23 becomes too thick, not only<br>
would no change in the protection effect be expected but also<br>
disadvantages of high cost or long production time would be possibly<br>
brought about.<br>
[0112]<br>
As a layered structure of the optical recording medium 100, a<br>
structure formed by stacking the substrate 10, the recording layer 21, the<br>
reflection layer 22, and the protection layer 23 in this order is exemplified<br>
as above, but the other layered structures may be employed. For example,<br>
on the upper face of the protection layer 23 in the above exemplified<br>
structure, or on the upper face of the reflection layer 22 in the case where<br>
the protection layer 23 is removed from the above exemplified structure, an<br>
additional substrate may be bonded together. The additional substrate<br>
may be a bare substrate having no layers thereon or a substrate having an<br>
arbitrary layer such as a reflection layer on the bonding face or the<br>
opposite face thereof. Furthermore, an optical recording medium having<br>
the layered structure exemplified above and an optical recording medium<br>
given by removing the protection layer from the layered structure<br><br>
exemplified above may be bonded together in a manner that each upper<br>
face of the protection layer and/or reflection layer faces each other.<br>
[0113]<br>
Hereinafter, a second embodiment of the optical recording medium<br>
will be described.<br>
FIGURE 2 shows a second embodiment of an optical recording<br>
medium 200 to which the present embodiment (an air incident type media<br>
is exemplified here) is applied. The portions similar to the optical recording<br>
medium 100 according to the first embodiment are represented by the<br>
same reference numbers, and the explanations thereof are omitted.<br>
[0114]<br>
The optical recording medium 200 shown in FIG. 2 has a substrate<br>
30 having a predetermined guide groove 31, and an information recording<br>
layer 40 disposed on the substrate 30. In the information recording layer<br>
40, a recording layer 41 and a protection film 43 are laminated in this<br>
order on a reflection layer 42. The optical recording medium 200 performs<br>
recording and reading of information with a laser light irradiated from the<br>
side of the protection film 43.<br>
[0115]<br>
The protection film 43 may be a film or sheet bonded with an<br>
adhesive, or may be formed by coating and curing or drying a film-forming<br>
coating solution prepared from the same material as the aforementioned<br>
protection layer 23 (FIG. 1). The thickness of the protection film 43 is<br>
generally 0.1 µm or more and preferably 3 µm or more because a certain<br>
thickness is required to provide an adequate protection effect. However,<br>
the thickness is generally 300 µm or less and preferably 200 µm or less<br>
because, when the protection film 43 becomes too thick, not only would no<br><br>
change in the protection effect be expected but also disadvantages of high<br>
cost or long production time would be possibly brought about. Similar<br>
layers used in the aforementioned optical recording medium 100 (FIG. 1)<br>
may be used for the each layer such as the recording layer 41 and the<br>
reflection layer 42. Note that, in the present layered structure, the<br>
substrate 30 is not required to be transparent. Therefore, besides the<br>
aforementioned materials, there may be used opaque resins, ceramics,<br>
metals (including alloys) and the like. In such layered structure, an<br>
arbitrary layer may be interposed between the aforementioned layers as<br>
long as the properties in accordance with the present invention are not<br>
impaired.<br>
[0116]<br>
As one of the methods for increasing the recording density of the<br>
optical recording media 100 and 200, there may be mentioned a method of<br>
increasing the numerical aperture (NA) of an objective lens. The size of a<br>
light spot focused on the information recording face may be micronized<br>
using this method. However, the increase in the numerical aperture (NA)<br>
of the objective lens possibly brings about the increase in the aberration of<br>
the light spot caused by the warp and the like of the optical recording<br>
media 100 and 200 when laser light is irradiated for recording and reading.<br>
Under such conditions, an adequate, stable recording and reading of<br>
signals is not attained in some cases. Such aberration tends to become<br>
larger as the thickness of the transparent substrate or protection film<br>
through which laser light passes becomes larger, so that it is desirable that<br>
the substrate or protection film be designed as thin as possible. However,<br>
generally, since the substrates 10 and 30 are required to have a certain<br>
thickness to assure the mechanical strength of the optical recording media<br><br>
100 and 200, it is preferable to employ the structure of the optical<br>
recording medium 200 (that is, the optical recording medium 200 having a<br>
basic layered structure composed of the substrate 30, reflection layer 42,<br>
recording layer 41, and protection film 43) in this case. The optical<br>
recording medium 200 is preferably used because the thickness of the<br>
protection film 43 of the optical recording medium 200 may be reduced<br>
more easily as compared with the substrate 10 of the optical recording<br>
medium 100.<br>
[0117]<br>
Note that, even in the structure of the optical recording medium 100<br>
(that is, the optical recording medium 100 having a basic layered structure<br>
composed of the substrate 10, recording layer 21, reflection layer 22, and<br>
protection layer 23), by reducing to around 50 µm to 300 µm the thickness<br>
of the transparent substrate 10, through which a recording and reading<br>
laser light passes, the aberration may be reduced to such an extent that<br>
the optical recording medium becomes usable. Further, after the other<br>
layers are formed, a UV light curable resin layer or an inorganic thin film<br>
may be formed on the incident face of a recording and reading laser light<br>
(generally, the lower face of the substrate 10) to protect the face or to<br>
prevent dust deposition. On a face other than the laser light incident face<br>
(generally, the upper face of the reflection layer 22 or protection layer 23),<br>
there may be formed a print receiving layer capable of being drawn or<br>
printed with various printers such as an ink-jet and a thermal head, or<br>
various pens and pencils.<br>
[0118]<br>
In the optical recording media 100 and 200 in accordance with the<br>
present embodiments, the laser light used for recording and reading of<br><br>
information has preferably a wavelength as short as possible to attain high<br>
density recording. In particular, a laser light having a wavelength of 350<br>
nm to 530 nm is preferable. As a typical laser light having such<br>
wavelength, there may be mentioned laser lights having s center<br>
wavelengths of 405 nm, 410 nm, and 515 nm.<br>
[0119]<br>
The laser light having a wavelength of 350 nm to 530 nm may be<br>
obtained by using a high power semiconductor laser light having<br>
wavelengths of 405 nm and 410 nm of blue color and a wavelength of 515<br>
nm of blue-green color. Besides the above, the laser light may be also<br>
obtained, for example, by converting the wavelength of either of the<br>
following oscillating laser light using a second harmonic generator (SHG):<br>
(a)	a semiconductor laser light having a fundamental oscillation wavelength<br>
of 740 nm to 960 nm and a capability of continuous wave oscillation; and<br>
(b)	a solid-state laser light excited by a semiconductor laser light and has a<br>
fundamental oscillation wavelength of 740 nm to 960 nm and a capability<br>
of continuous wave oscillation.<br>
[0120]<br>
Here, as the SHG, any piezo element free from reversal symmetry<br>
may be usable, but KDP, ADP, BNN, KN, LBO, compound semiconductors,<br>
and the like are preferable. As the specific example of the second<br>
harmonic, in the case of a semiconductor laser light having a fundamental<br>
wavelength of 860 nm, there may be mentioned 430 nm that is a<br>
double-frequency wave, and in the case of the solid-state laser light excited<br>
by a semiconductor laser, there may be mentioned 430 nm that is a<br>
double-frequency wave generated from a Cr-doped LiSrAlF6 crystal (having<br>
a fundamental oscillation wavelength of 860 nm).<br><br>
[0121]<br>
When information is recorded in the optical recording media 100 and<br>
200 according to the present embodiments, a laser light focused in around<br>
0.4 µm to 0.6 µm is irradiated, on the recording layer 21 through the<br>
substrate 10 from the side of the substrate 10, in the case of the optical<br>
recording medium 100, and on the recording layer 41 through the<br>
protection film 43 from the side of the protection film 43 in the case of the<br>
optical recording medium 200. The portions of the recording layers 21<br>
and 41 that are irradiated by the laser light absorb the energy of the laser<br>
light and cause thermal deformation such as decomposition, heat<br>
generation, and fusion, resulting in changes in the optical properties.<br>
When the information recorded in the recording layers 21 and 41 is read, a<br>
laser light having a lower energy is irradiated on the recording layers 21<br>
and 41 (generally, from the same side as in recording). In the recording<br>
layers 21 and 41, the difference in reflectance between a portion subjected<br>
to a change in optical properties (that is, an information recorded portion)<br>
and another portion subjected to no change is read out to read the<br>
information.<br>
Example<br>
[0122]<br>
The present embodiments are explained in more detail by the<br>
following Examples, but the present embodiments are not limited by the<br>
Examples as long as the embodiments are within the scope thereof.<br>
[0123]<br>
(Synthesis Method)<br>
The method of synthesizing the metal-containing cyclic p-diketone azo<br>
compound is not particularly limited, but generally there may be mentioned<br><br>
the following synthesis method. Firstly, a heterocyclic aromatic amine is<br>
diazotized in an acidic solution by adding sodium nitrite or nitrosylsulfuric<br>
acid, so that a diazo component is synthesized. Secondly, the resulting<br>
diazo component is added dropwise at around 0°C to a solution that<br>
dissolves a coupler component to synthesize an azo compound.<br>
Subsequently, to a solution dissolving the resulting azo compound in an<br>
appropriate solvent, a solution of a metal salt is added dropwise to<br>
synthesize a metal complex compound. The following example shows a<br>
structure of a metal complex compound having a 2:1 composition of a diazo<br>
compound and a divalent metal ion.<br>
[0124]<br>
[Chemical 39]<br><br>
[0125]<br>
(Example 1)<br>
(a) Synthesis example<br>
In a solution containing 25 ml of acetic acid, 8.5 ml of propionic acid,<br>
and 1 ml of cone, sulfuric acid, 2.45 g of 3-amino-5-methylisoxazole (0.025<br>
mol, manufactured by Tokyo Chemical Industry Co., Ltd.) represented by<br>
the following structural formula (1) were dissolved with stirring and the<br>
resulting solution was cooled at 0°C to 5°C. To this solution, 8.85 g of 43%<br><br>
nitrosyl sulfuric acid was added dropwise, while the temperature of the<br>
solution was kept at 10°C or lower, to prepare a diazo solution. On the<br>
other hand, in another vessel, 5 g of 1,3-diethyl-2-thiobarbituric acid (0.025<br>
mol, manufactured by Aldrich Corp.) represented by the following structural<br>
formula (2), 7.5 g of sodium acetate, and 1 g of urea were dissolved in 100<br>
ml of methanol and 20 ml of water with stirring. After the pH of the<br>
resulting solution was adjusted at 5 with hydrochloric acid, the solution<br>
was cooled to 0°C to 5°C.<br>
[0126]<br>
[Chemical 40]<br><br>
[0127]<br>
To this solution, the aforementioned diazo solution was added<br>
dropwise at a temperature of 5°C or lower while the pH was kept at 4 to 5<br>
with a 14% aqueous ammonia. After the addition, the resulting reaction<br>
solution was stirred for 30 minutes, and then filtered. The filtered product<br>
was suspended in 500 ml of water to remove inorganic salt. After<br>
30-minute stirring, the suspension was filtered. Further, the filtered<br>
product was suspended in 200 ml of methanol, and the resulting<br>
suspension was stirred and filtered. The filtered product was dried by<br>
heating under vacuum to obtain 6.847 g of an azo compound (yield: 88.5%).<br>
MS measurement (EI) of the azo compound was done, and the azo<br>
compound was confirmed to have m/z = 309 that coincided with those of<br>
the target compound (example compound (115)).<br>
[0128]<br><br>
1H-NMR (CDCl3 (δ = ppm) MHz) of the example compound (115) was<br>
measured. The results were: 1.31 (6H, t, 1, 3N-CH2CH3), 2.46 (3H, s,<br>
5'-CH3), 4.55 (4H, m, 1, 3N-CH2CH3), and 6.51 (1H, s, 4'-H). The peaks of<br>
the results coincided with those of the objective compound. The example<br>
compound (115) exhibited Amax = 383.5 nm and a molar absorption<br>
coefficient of 3.9×104 in chloroform. FIGURE 3 shows the spectrum of the<br>
example compound (115) in solution.<br>
[0129]<br>
[Chemical 41]<br><br>
[0130]<br>
Next, 1.86 g (0.006 mol) of the example compound (115) was dissolved<br>
in 46 ml of tetrahydrofuran with stirring. The resulting solution was<br>
filtered to remove insolubles. To the filtrate, a solution dissolving 0.896 g<br>
(0.0036 mol) of nickel acetate in 15 ml of methanol was added dropwise.<br>
The resulting reaction solution was stirred for 1 hour and<br>
vacuum-evaporated with an evaporator, to distill out the solvent and to<br>
deposit a solid. To the solid, 50 ml of water was added. The resulting<br>
mixture was stirred and filtered. The filtered product was washed with<br>
isopropyl ether, and then dried by heating under vacuum to obtain 1.66 g<br>
(yield: 81.7%) of a compound represented by the following structural<br>
formula (3) (the product obtained was called metal complex compound (1)).<br>
The metal complex compound (1) exhibited Amax = 428 nm and a<br>
molar absorption coefficient of 5.4×104 in chloroform. FIGURE 4 shows the<br><br>
spectrum of the metal complex compound (1) in solution.<br>
[0131]<br>
[Chemical 42]<br><br>
[0132]<br>
(b) Evaluation of optical recording medium<br>
The aforementioned metal complex compound (1) was dissolved in<br>
octafluoropentanol to obtain a 1 wt% solution. After filtration, the solution<br>
was added dropwise on an injection-molded polycarbonate resin substrate<br>
disk 0.6 mm thick, 120 mm in diameter to be spin-coated (at 500 rpm).<br>
After the coating, the resulting coating was dried at 100°C for 30 min. The<br>
resulting coating film had a maximum absorption wavelength (Amax) at<br>
427.5 nm. The spectrum of the coating film obtained by coating the metal<br>
complex compound (1) is shown in FIGURE. 5.<br>
[0133]<br>
A chip of the substrate disk coated with the metal complex compound<br>
(1) was irradiated with a Xe lamp of 550 mW at 63°C for 40 hours, using a<br>
light resistance tester (SUNTEST XLS+, manufactured by Toyo Seiki<br>
Seisaku-Sho, Ltd.). After that, the absorbance at Amax before the Xe lamp<br>
irradiation and the absorbance at Amax after the Xe lamp irradiation were<br>
measured using a UV measuring instrument. The ratio (%) of the<br>
absorbance after the Xe lamp irradiation with respect to the absorbance<br>
before the Xe lamp irradiation was 55.1%. Note that, the larger the value of<br>
the absorbance is, the better the light resistance is.<br><br>
[0134]<br>
In addition, on the coating film thus prepared, if necessary, a<br>
reflection layer of Ag or the like is formed by sputtering, further a UV light<br>
curable resin is coated by spin-coating or the like and cured by UV light<br>
irradiation to form a protection layer, so that an optical recording medium<br>
may be obtained. The optical recording medium has a recording and<br>
reading capability, depending on the λmax value of the coating film, for<br>
example, with a semiconductor laser light having a center wavelength of 405<br>
nm. Namely, it is found that the metal-containing cyclic 0-diketone azo<br>
compound has a molecular structure workable for blue laser recording.<br>
[0135]<br>
(Method of preparing optical recording media and example of recording)<br>
The aforementioned metal complex compound (1) was dissolved in<br>
tetrafluoropropanol to obtain a 0.9 wt% solution. After filtration, the<br>
resulting solution was added dropwise and spin-coated on an injection<br>
molded polycarbonate resin substrate disk 0.6 mm thick, 120 mm in<br>
diameter having a track pitch of 400 nm, a groove width of 220 nm, and a<br>
groove depth of 60 nm. The spin-coating revolution was increased from<br>
800 rpm to 7,000 rpm in 13 seconds and kept at 7,000 rpm for 2 seconds.<br>
Then, the resulting coating was dried at 75°C for 18 minutes to form a<br>
recording layer. After that, a silver alloy was sputtered on the recording<br>
layer to form a 120 nm thick reflection layer. Then, a protection coating<br>
agent of a UV light curable resin was spin-coated on the disk, and the disk<br>
was irradiated with a UV light to form a 5 µm thick protection layer. Still<br>
further, using a delayed curing adhesive, another 0.6 mm thick<br>
polycarbonate substrate disk was bonded to the face on the protection layer<br>
side to prepare an optical recording medium for evaluation.<br><br>
[0136]<br>
(c) Example of recording<br>
While the foregoing optical recording medium for evaluation was<br>
rotated at a linear velocity of 6.61 m/sec, a single frequency signal of 8T<br>
mark and 8T space was recorded on the groove with a laser light of 405 nm<br>
wavelength (the numerical aperture of an objective lens, NA = 0.65). Here,<br>
T is a fundamental clock frequency corresponding to a frequency of 65 MHz.<br>
The recording pulse strategy was as follows: the number of the divided<br>
pulses was (n-1) when the mark length was nT; the forefront recording pulse<br>
width was 2T; the following recording pulse width was 0.5T; the bias power<br>
was 3.0 mW; the reading power was 0.4 mW; and the recording power was<br>
variable. As a result, a signal with a modulation degree of 51% was<br>
recorded at 7.5 mW. The modulation degree is considered to become larger<br>
by optimizing the recording conditions such as the pulse strategy.<br>
[0137]<br>
(Example 2)<br>
(a) Synthesis example<br>
In a solution containing 50 ml of acetic acid, 35 g of phosphoric acid,<br>
and 5 g of conc, sulfuric acid, 3.5 g of 2-aminothiazole (0.035 mol,<br>
manufactured by Tokyo Chemical Industry Co., Ltd.) represented by the<br>
following structural formula (4) was dissolved and the resulting solution was<br>
cooled at 0°C to 5°C. To this solution, 12.39 g of 43% nitrosyl sulfuric acid<br>
was added drop wise while the temperature of the solution was kept at 10°C<br>
or lower to prepare a diazo solution. On the other hand, in another vessel,<br>
5.3 g of a compound (1.05 equivalent amount, manufactured by Tokyo<br>
Chemical Industry Co., Ltd.) represented by the following structural formula<br>
(5), 10.5 g of sodium acetate, and 1.4 g of urea were dissolved in a solution<br><br>
of 140 ml of methanol and 35 ml of water. After the pH of the resulting<br>
solution was adjusted at 5 with hydrochloric acid, the solution was cooled<br>
to 0°C to 5°C.<br>
[0138]<br>
[Chemical 43]<br><br>
[0139]<br>
To this solution, the aforementioned diazo solution was added<br>
dropwise at a temperature of 5°C or lower while the pH was kept at 4 to 5<br>
with a 14% aqueous ammonia. After the addition, the resulting reaction<br>
solution was stirred for 30 minutes, and then filtered. The filtered product<br>
was suspended in 500 ml of water to remove inorganic salt. After<br>
30-minute stirring, the suspension was filtered. Further, the filtered<br>
product was suspended in 150 ml of methanol, and the resulting<br>
suspension was stirred and filtered. The filtered product was dried by<br>
heating under vacuum to obtain 6.458 g of an azo compound (yield: 72.3%).<br>
The azo compound exhibited λmax = 384.5 nm and a molar absorption<br>
coefficient of 1.7×104 in chloroform.<br>
[0140]<br>
The azo compound was subjected to the MS measurement (EI), and<br>
was confirmed to have m/z = 255 that coincided with an objective<br>
compound. The azo compound was subjected to the 1H-NMR<br>
measurement (CDCl3 (δ = ppm) MHz). The results were as follows: 1.83<br>
(6H, s, 2, 2-CH3), 7.12 (1H, d, 5'-H), 7.55 (1H, d, 4'-H), and 13.76 (1H, s,<br><br>
6-OH). The peaks of the results coincided with those of the objective<br>
compound (example compound (116)).<br>
[0141]<br>
[Chemical 44]<br><br>
[0142]<br>
In 28 ml of tetrahydrofuran, 1.53 g (0.006 mol) of the example<br>
compound (116) was dissolved while stirring. The resulting solution was<br>
filtered to remove insolubles. To the filtrate, a solution containing 0.9 g<br>
(0.0036 mol) of nickel acetate tetrahydrate in 16 ml of methanol was added<br>
dropwise. The resulting reaction solution was stirred for 1 hour, and then<br>
filtered to separate a product. The resulting solid product was washed with<br>
water, and then dried by heating under vacuum to obtain 1.552 g (yield:<br>
91.2%) of a compound represented by the following structural formula (6)<br>
(the product obtained was called metal complex compound (2).) The<br>
example metal complex compound (141) exhibited λmax = 420.5 nm and a<br>
molar absorption coefficient of 3.9×104 in chloroform.<br>
[0143]<br>
[Chemical 45]<br><br>
[0144]<br><br>
(b) Evaluation of optical recording medium<br>
The aforementioned metal complex compound (2) was dissolved in<br>
octafluoropentanol to obtain a 1 wt% solution. After filtration, the solution<br>
was added dropwise on an injection-molded polycarbonate resin substrate<br>
disk 0.6 mm thick, 120 mm in diameter to be spin-coated. After the<br>
coating, the resulting coating was dried at 100°C for 30 min. The resulting<br>
coating film had a maximum absorption wavelength (λmax) at 423.5 nm.<br>
The spectrum of the coating film obtained by coating the metal complex<br>
compound (2) is shown in FIGURE. 6.<br>
[0145]<br>
An optical recording medium was prepared as follows. A chip of the<br>
substrate disk coated with the metal complex compound (2) was irradiated<br>
with a Xe lamp of 550 mW at 63°C for 40 hours, using a light resistance<br>
tester (SUNTEST XLS+, manufactured by Toyo Seiki Seisaku-Sho, Ltd.) to<br>
evaluate light resistance in the same manner as in Example 1. The light<br>
resistance was 97.2%.<br>
[0146]<br>
The aforementioned metal complex compound (2) was dissolved in<br>
tetrafluoropropanol to obtain a 0.9 wt% solution. After filtration, the<br>
resulting solution was added dropwise and spin-coated on an injection<br>
molded polycarbonate resin substrate disk 0.6 mm thick, 120 mm in<br>
diameter having a track pitch of 400 nm, a groove width of 220 nm, and a<br>
groove depth of 60 nm. The spin-coating revolution was increased from<br>
800 rpm to 7,000 rpm in 13 seconds and kept at 7,000 rpm for 2 seconds.<br>
Then, the resulting coating was dried at 75°C for 18 minutes to form a<br>
recording layer. After that, a silver alloy was sputtered on the recording<br>
layer to form a 120 nm thick reflection layer. Then, a protection coating<br><br>
agent of a UV light curable resin was spin-coated, irradiated with a UV light<br>
to form a 5 µm thick protection layer. Still further, using a delayed curing<br>
adhesive, another 0.6 mm thick polycarbonate substrate disk was bonded to<br>
the face on the protection layer side to prepare an optical recording medium<br>
for evaluation.<br>
[0147]<br>
(c) Example of recording<br>
While the foregoing optical recording medium for evaluation was<br>
rotated at a linear velocity of 6.61 m/sec, a single frequency signal of 8T<br>
mark and 8T space was recorded on the groove with a laser light of 405 nm<br>
wavelength (the numerical aperture of an objective lens, NA = 0.65). Here,<br>
T is a fundamental clock frequency corresponding to a frequency of 65 MHz.<br>
The recording pulse strategy was as follows: the number of the divided<br>
pulses was (n-1) when the mark length was nT; the forefront recording pulse<br>
width was 2T; the following recording pulse width was 0.5T; the bias power<br>
was 3.0 mW; the reading power was 0.4 mW; and the recording power was<br>
variable. As a result, a signal with a modulation degree of 51% was<br>
recorded at 6.5 mW. The modulation degree is considered to become larger<br>
by optimizing the recording conditions such as the pulse strategy.<br>
[0148]<br>
(Example 3)<br>
(a) Synthesis example<br>
In 28 ml of tetrahydrofuran, 1.53 g (0.006 mol) of the example<br>
compound (116) synthesized in Example 2 was dissolved while stirring.<br>
The resulting solution was filtered to remove insolubles. To the filtrate, a<br>
solution containing 0.9 g (0.0036 mol) of cobalt acetate in 16 ml of methanol<br>
was added dropwise. The resulting reaction solution was stirred for 1<br><br>
hour; and then filtered to separate a product. The resulting solid product<br>
was washed with water, and then dried by heating under vacuum to obtain<br>
1.22 g (yield: 71.6%) of a compound represented by the following structural<br>
formula (7). The compound exhibited Amax = 417.5 nm and a molar<br>
absorption coefficient of 3.3×104 in chloroform (the product obtained was<br>
called metal complex compound (3).)<br>
[0149]<br>
[Chemical 46]<br><br>
[0150]<br>
(b) Evaluation of optical recording medium<br>
The metal complex compound (3) was dissolved in octafluoropentanol<br>
to obtain a 1 wt% solution. After filtration, the resulting solution was<br>
added dropwise on an injection-molded polycarbonate resin substrate disk<br>
0.6 mm thick, 120 mm in diameter to be spin-coated. After that, the<br>
resulting coating was dried at 100°C for 30 min. The resulting coating film<br>
had a maximum absorption wavelength (Amax) at 420.5 nm. The spectrum<br>
of the coating film obtained by coating the metal complex compound (3) is<br>
shown in FIGURE. 7.<br>
[0151]<br>
A chip of the substrate disk coated with the metal complex compound<br>
(3) was irradiated with a Xe lamp of 550 mW at 63°C for 40 hours, using a<br>
light resistance tester (SUNTEST XLS+, manufactured by Toyo Seiki<br>
Seisaku-Sho, Ltd.) to evaluate light resistance in the same manner as in<br><br>
Example 1. The light resistance was 94.1%.<br>
[0152]<br>
Method of preparing optical recording media and example of recording<br>
The aforementioned metal complex compound (3) was dissolved in<br>
tetrafluoropropanol to obtain a 0.9 wt% solution. After filtration, the<br>
resulting solution was added dropwise and spin-coated on an injection<br>
molded polycarbonate resin substrate disk 0.6 mm thick, 120 mm in<br>
diameter having a track pitch of 400 nm, a groove width of 220 nm, and a<br>
groove depth of 60 nm. The spin-coating revolution was increased from<br>
800 rpm to 7,000 rpm in 13 seconds and kept at 7,000 rpm for 2 seconds.<br>
Then, the resulting coating was dried at 75°C for 18 minutes to form a<br>
recording layer. After that, a silver alloy was sputtered on the recording<br>
layer to form a 120 nm thick reflection layer. Then, a protection coating<br>
agent of a UV light curable resin was spin-coated, irradiated with a UV light<br>
to form a 5 µm thick protection layer. Still further, using a delayed curing<br>
adhesive, another 0.6 mm thick polycarbonate substrate disk was bonded to<br>
the face on the protection layer side to prepare an optical recording medium<br>
for evaluation.<br>
[0153]<br>
(c) Example of recording<br>
While the foregoing optical recording medium for evaluation was<br>
rotated at a linear velocity of 6.61 m/sec, a single frequency signal of 8T<br>
mark and 8T space was recorded on the groove with a laser light of 405 nm<br>
wavelength (the numerical aperture of an objective lens, NA = 0.65). Here,<br>
T is a fundamental clock frequency corresponding to a frequency of 65 MHz.<br>
The recording pulse strategy was as follows: the number of the divided<br>
pulses was (n-1) when the mark length was nT; the forefront recording pulse<br><br>
width was 2T; the following recording pulse width was 0.5T; the bias power<br>
was 3.0 mW; the reading power was 0.4 mW; and the recording power was<br>
variable. As a result, a signal with a modulation degree of 48.4% was<br>
recorded at 6.4 mW. The modulation degree is considered to become larger<br>
by optimizing the recording conditions such as the pulse strategy.<br>
[0154]<br>
(Examples 4 to 151)<br>
By using the synthesis method similarly to the method mentioned<br>
above, an example azo compound (115) to an example azo compound (189)<br>
were synthesized, and further converted to metal complex compounds.<br>
Absorption spectra of coating films prepared similarly to Example 1 were<br>
measured. The maximum absorption wavelength and molar absorption<br>
coefficient in a solution (chloroform) of the metal complex compounds, and<br>
the maximum absorption wavelength of the coating films<br>
(octafluoropentanol or tetrafluoropropanol was selected as a coating solvent<br>
as appropriate) were measured. Further, the coating films were subjected<br>
to the light resistance test. The results are shown in Tables 1 to 7 together<br>
with the results of Examples 1 to 3.<br>
[0155]<br><br><br><br>
[0156]<br><br><br><br>
[0157]<br><br><br><br>
[0158]<br><br><br><br>
[0159]<br><br><br><br>
[0160]<br><br><br><br>
[0161]<br><br><br>
[0162]<br>
The wavelength of the metal-containing cyclic β-diketone azo<br><br>
compound is determined by the combination of the diazo component, the<br>
coupler component, and the metal ion. In the case of selecting the same<br>
coupler component and the metal, a compound having a long wavelength<br>
may be obtained by using a diazo component having a longer wavelength.<br>
Similarly, in the case of selecting the same diazo component and the metal,<br>
a metal-containing cyclic β-diketone azo compound having a longer<br>
wavelength may be obtained by using a coupler component having a longer<br>
wavelength. The wavelength may become longer or shorter depending on<br>
the substituents and the like, but generally the following tendency may be<br>
drawn within the range of the present Examples.<br>
[0163]<br>
[Chemical 47]<br>
[0164]<br>
The tendency may vary depending on the combination with the<br>
coupler component or the kinds of metals, but the light resistance roughly<br>
depends on the diazo component in many respects. The diazo component<br>
such as isoxazole and triazole that has a shorter wavelength is likely to<br>
provide a rather lower light resistance, while the diazo component such as<br>
thiazole and benzothiazole that has a longer wavelength provides a good<br>
light resistance. Therefore, a compound having a large light resistance may<br><br>
be synthesized from a coupler component having a shorter wavelength and<br>
a diazo component having a longer wavelength. Besides the<br>
aforementioned combinations of the diazo component and coupler<br>
component, a compound that meets an objective wavelength may be<br>
synthesized by selecting the substituent of the diazo component or selecting<br>
the kind of the metals. In this way, for example, the metal-containing<br>
cyclic β-diketone azo compounds shown in Table 1 may be used over a wide<br>
wavelength range of from 368.5 nm to 482 nm.<br>
[0165]<br>
In addition, on the coating film thus prepared, if necessary, Ag and<br>
the like may be sputtered to form a reflection layer, further a UV light<br>
curable resin may be spin-coated and cured by UV light irradiation to form<br>
a protection layer. In this way, an optical recording medium may be<br>
obtained. The optical recording medium has a recording and reading<br>
capability, for example, depending on the Amax value of the coating film,<br>
with a semiconductor laser light having a center wavelength of 405 nm.<br>
Namely, it is found that the metal-containing cyclic 3-diketone azo<br>
compound composed of an azo compound represented by the general<br>
formula (I) or general formula (II) and metal has a molecular structure<br>
workable for blue laser recording.<br>
[0166]<br>
The results shown in Tables 1 to 7 indicate that the light resistance of<br>
the metal complex compound is likely to be affected by the diazo<br>
component, the coupler component, or the kind of metal ion. For example,<br>
when isoxazole is selected as the diazo component (Examples 1, 5, 8, 23 to<br>
27, 38, and 41), the maximum value of the light resistance is only as large<br>
as 65.2%. In the case of Examples 2 and 3 where metal complexes<br><br>
compound having the same coupler component are used, the light<br>
resistance exceeds 90%. As opposed to Examples 2 and 3, in the case of<br>
Example 8 in which a metal complex compound having a coupler<br>
component different from the coupler component used in Examples 2 and 3,<br>
the light resistance is only 42.9%. Still further, in the case of Example 25<br>
in which a metal complex compound composed of an azo compound and Co<br>
ion is used, the light resistance is 65.2%. As opposed to Example 25, in<br>
the case of Example 27 in which a metal complex compound composed of<br>
the same azo compound as above and Zn ion is used, the light resistance<br>
decreases to 1.7%.<br>
[0167]<br>
A metal complex compound having a small light resistance may be<br>
admixed with another metal complex compound having an adequate light<br>
resistance or an organic dye compound and the like used for conventional<br>
CD-Rs and others, for example, so that the light resistance may be improved<br>
to a practical level required for optical recording media.<br>
[0168]<br>
Further, the metal complex compound having a small light resistance<br>
may be effectively admixed with a compound having a singlet oxygen<br>
quenching effect (for example, acetylacetonate chelate, bisphenyldithiol,<br>
salicylaldehyde-oxime, bisdithio-a-diketone, and the like).<br>
[0169]<br>
(Comparative Example 1)<br>
For comparison, the following compound (8) was synthesized and<br>
evaluated in terms of an optical recording medium,<br>
(a) Preparation example<br>
From 2-amino-6-methylbenzothiazole (manufactured by Tokyo<br><br>
Chemical Industry Co., Ltd.) represented by the following structural formula<br>
(8) and l-n-butyl-3-cyano-4-methyl-6-hydroxy-2-pyridone, the following<br>
compound (9) was synthesized. The compound (9) exhibited a Amax of<br>
453.5 nm and a molar absorption coefficient of 3.2×104 in chloroform.<br><br>
The compound (9) was subjected to chelation using nickel acetate to<br>
obtain the following compound (10). The compound (10) exhibited a Amax<br>
at 524 nm and a molar absorption coefficient of 7.4×104 in chloroform.<br>
[0173]<br><br>
(b) Example of Optical recording medium<br>
The compound (10) was added to octafluoropentanol to prepare a 1<br><br>
wt% solution, but the compound (10) had a poor solubility and about half of<br>
the compound (10) added remained undissolved. After filtration, the<br>
resulting solution was added dropwise on an injection molded polycarbonate<br>
resin substrate disk 0.6 mm thick, 120 mm in diameter to be spin-coated<br>
(500 rpm). The resulting coating was dried at 100°C for 30 minutes. The<br>
resulting coating film had a maximum absorption wavelength (λmax) at<br>
542.5 nm. However, the absorption at a wavelength of 405 nm was quite<br>
small. Recording using a laser light having a center wavelength of 405 nm<br>
is found not to be expected.<br>
[0175]<br>
FIGURE 8 shows the absorption spectrum of the compound (10). The<br>
absorption spectrum is shown together with the spectrum of a nickel<br>
compound (Example 15) that used Meldrum's acid as a coupler component.<br>
FIGURE 8 shows that the compound (10) is not an adequate dye<br>
compound for use in recording with a blue laser light, because the<br>
compound (10) has a different coupler component even though the<br>
compound (10) is a metal-containing azo compound using as the diazo<br>
component the same benzothiazole as the complex compound of Example<br>
15 that exhibited a large absorption at 405 nm.<br>
[0176]<br>
(Comparative Example 2)<br>
For comparison, the following compound (11) was synthesized and<br>
evaluated in terms of an optical recording medium,<br>
(a) Preparation example<br>
In a similar method, 2-amino-5-methyl-l,3,4-thiadiazole<br>
(manufactured by Tokyo Chemical Industry Co., Ltd.) was diazotized, and<br>
subjected to coupling reaction under the same conditions as in Example 1<br><br>
to synthesize the following compound (11). The compound (11) exhibited a<br>
Amax at 409.5 nm and a molar absorption coefficient of 3.0×104 in<br>
chloroform.<br>
[0177]<br>
[Chemical 51]<br><br>
[0178]<br>
The compound (11) was subjected to the chelation using nickel<br>
acetate in a manner similar to Comparative Example 1 to obtain the<br>
following compound (12). The compound (12) exhibited a Amax at 494 nm<br>
and a molar absorption coefficient of 7.1x104 in chloroform. FIGURE 9<br>
shows the absorption spectrum of the compound (12). The absorption<br>
spectrum is shown together with the spectrum of a nickel complex (Example<br>
32) that used barbituric acid as a coupler component. FIGURE 9 shows<br>
that the compound (12) is not an adequate dye compound for use in<br>
recording with a blue laser light as opposed to the metal complex compound<br>
of Example 32 that exhibited a large absorption at 405 nm.<br>
[0179]<br>
[Chemical 52]<br><br>
[0180]<br><br>
(b) Example of Optical recording medium<br>
The compound (12) was added to octafluoropentanol to prepare a 1<br>
wt% solution, but the compound (12) had a poor solubility and almost all of<br>
the compound (12) added remained undissolved. After filtration, the<br>
resulting solution was added dropwise on an injection molded polycarbonate<br>
resin substrate disk 0.6 mm thick, 120 mm in diameter to be spin-coated<br>
(500 rpm). The resulting coating was dried at 100°C for 30 minutes.<br>
Because of the poor solubility, the resulting coating film provided no<br>
absorption spectrum.<br>
The above result shows that when the pyridone structure is used as<br>
the coupler component, the wavelength becomes long enough even though<br>
1,3,4-thiadiazole is used as the diazo component, so that benzothiazole or<br>
thiazole mentioned in the previous section is obviously useless.<br>
[0181]<br>
(Comparative Example 3)<br>
For comparison, an azo compound was synthesized using a linear<br>
β-diketone as the coupler component,<br>
(a) Preparation example<br>
In a solution containing 6 ml of acetic acid, 2 ml of propionic acid,<br>
and 1.3 ml of conc, sulfuric acid, 1.4 g of 2-amino-4-methylthiazole (0.013<br>
mol, manufactured by Tokyo Chemical Industry Co., Ltd.) represented by<br>
the following structural formula (13) was dissolved while stirring, and the<br>
resulting solution was cooled at 0°C to 5°C. To this solution, 4.6 g of 43%<br>
nitrosyl sulfuric acid was added dropwise while the temperature of the<br>
solution was kept at 10°C or lower to prepare a diazo solution.<br>
[0182]<br>
On the other hand, in another vessel, 2.8 g of thenoyltrifluoroacetone<br><br>
(1 equivalent amount, manufactured by Tokyo Chemical Industry Co., Ltd.),<br>
4.3 g of sodium acetate, and 0.43 g of urea were dissolved in a solution of<br>
50 ml of methanol and 5 ml of water. After the pH of the resulting solution<br>
was adjusted at 11 with a 20% aqueous NaOH solution, the solution was<br>
cooled at 0°C to 5°C. To the solution, the foregoing diazo solution was<br>
added dropwise at a temperature of 5°C or lower while the pH was kept at<br>
10 with an aqueous ammonia. After the addition was over, the resulting<br>
solution was stirred for 30 minutes, and then filtered. The resulting filtrate<br>
was poured into water and the resulting solution was acidified by adding<br>
conc, hydrochloric acid dropwise to deposit a reaction product. The<br>
reaction product was filtered, washed with water, and dried by heating<br>
under vacuum to obtain 0.96 g of a compound represented by the following<br>
chemical formula (15) with a yield of 21%.<br>
[0183]<br>
FIGURE 10 shows the absorption spectrum of the compound<br>
represented by the chemical formula (15). The compound represented by<br>
the chemical formula (15) has a λmax at 399.5 nm and a molar absorption<br>
coefficient of 1.0x104 in chloroform. As is shown, the yield of the<br>
compound represented by the chemical formula (15) is low and the molar<br>
absorption coefficient is also low.<br><br><br>
[Chemical 54]<br><br>
[0186]<br>
(Comparative Example 4)<br>
For comparison, the following compound (16) that has a comparable<br>
absorption at λmax was evaluated in terms of an optical recording medium.<br>
The cyanine dye (trade name: NK-1204, manufactured by Nippon<br>
Kanko Shikiso Kenkyusho Co., Ltd.) represented by the following structural<br>
formula (16) exhibited a Amax at 407.5 nm and a molar absorption<br>
coefficient of 8.2×104 in chloroform. FIGURE 11 shows the spectrum of the<br>
compound in solution.<br>
[0187]<br>
[Chemical 55]<br><br>
[0188]<br>
The compound (16) was dissolved in octafluoropentanol to prepare a 1<br>
wt% solution, which was then filtered. The resulting solution was added<br>
dropwise and spin-coated (500 rpm) on an injection-molded polycarbonate<br>
resin substrate disk 0.6 mm thick, 120 mm in diameter. The coating was<br>
dried at 100°C for 30 minutes. The resulting coating film had a maximum<br><br>
absorption wavelength (λmax) at 371.5 nm. FIGURE 12 shows the spectrum<br>
of the coating film.<br>
As is clear when the spectrum is compared with the spectrum in<br>
solution shown in FIG. 11, the spectrum of the coating film is extremely<br>
deformed. This deformation is possibly caused by partial crystallization of<br>
the coating on the surface of the substrate disk, although the crystallization<br>
was not observed by visual inspection.<br>
A chip of the substrate disk coated with the cyanine dye was<br>
subjected to the evaluation of absorption ratio at Amax (light resistance)<br>
similarly to Example 1. The light resistance was 18%.<br>
[0189]<br>
(Comparative Example 5)<br>
For similar comparison, the following compound (17) was evaluated in<br>
terms of an optical recording medium.<br>
The	compound	2-[2-furan-2-yl]<br>
vinyl]-4,6-bis(trichloromethyl)-l,3,5-triazine (manufactured by Tokyo<br>
Chemical Industry Co., Ltd.) represented by the following formula (17)<br>
exhibited a λmax at 375 nm in chloroform and the molar absorption<br>
coefficient of 3.5×104.<br>
[0190]	<br>
[Chemical 56]<br><br>
[0191]<br><br>
The compound (17) was dissolved in methyl lactate to prepare a 1 wt%<br>
solution, which was then filtered. The resulting solution was added<br>
dropwise and spin-coated (500 rpm) on an injection-molded polycarbonate<br>
resin substrate disk 0.6 mm thick, 120 mm in diameter. The coating was<br>
dried at 100°C for 30 minutes. The surface of the substrate disk became<br>
clouded by crystallization. A spectrum adequate for evaluation was not<br>
obtained.<br>
[0192]<br>
As is clear from the results of comparative Examples 4 and 5, even<br>
though dyes exhibit absorption in a similar range of wavelength, the film<br>
forming capability or light resistance thereof required for an optical<br>
recording medium is greatly different. Generally, crystallization in the<br>
course of forming the coating film is likely to develop remarkably as the<br>
molecule becomes smaller or the molecule has a higher planarity in the<br>
molecular structure. The metal-containing azo complex compound used in<br>
Examples of the present invention is composed of two molecules of an azo<br>
dye and one metal ion, having a sterically-bulky molecular structure,<br>
thereby seems to have characteristics less liable to crystallize on the surface<br>
of the substrate. In addition, a higher light resistance may be provided by<br>
forming the complex than by using the azo dye alone. As mentioned above,<br>
it is quite obvious that the present invention provides an extremely useful<br>
dye for an optical recording medium.<br>
[0193]<br>
As mentioned above, it is shown that, as the coupler component, a<br>
cyclic β-diketone structure has a higher yield and provides a compound<br>
having a larger molar absorption coefficient than a linear β-diketone<br>
structure. This may be attributed to the following reasons: when the<br><br>
coupler component has a ring structure, the active methylene group that<br>
serves as a reactive site is fixed and provides a higher reactivity; the<br>
reaction product has a tendency of getting a more planar structure and<br>
allows the conjugated system to extend more easily; and others.<br>
[0194]<br>
(Example 152)<br>
The optical recording medium obtained in Example 1 was subjected to<br>
PRSNR (Partial Response SNR) evaluation in accordance with the HD DVD-R<br>
standard Ver 1.0 defined by DVD Forum for evaluating the recording and<br>
reading performance of optical recording media.<br>
The optical recording medium obtained was recorded at a linear<br>
velocity of 6.61 m/s and a shortest mark length of 204 nm using a tester<br>
(ODU-1000, manufactured by Pulsetech Corp.) having a laser wavelength of<br>
405 nm and a NA (numerical aperture) of 0.65. The recording power was<br>
optimized to obtain a maximum value of PRSNR.<br>
The results were as follows: the recording mechanism was of the<br>
Low-To-High type; and the optimized recording power was 7.8 mW. The<br>
PRSNR value of the optical recording medium was 32.8, which exceeded<br>
substantially the standard PRSNR value of 15.<br>
[0195]<br>
(Examples 153 to 198)<br>
Optical recording media were prepared under the same conditions as<br>
in Example 152 except that the compounds shown in Tables 8 to 10 were<br>
used as dyes, and were evaluated in the same method as in Example 152.<br>
Here, recording sensitivity or recording characteristics depend on the<br>
thickness of a thin layer of the dye or the recording method, so that the<br>
concentration of the coating solution (0.9 wt% to 1.2 wt%), the spin-coating<br><br>
program, the groove shape of the substrate disk, the recording pulse width,<br>
and others were optimized to obtain an adequate recording performance.<br>
[0196]<br>
The optimized recording power and the value of PRSNR of Examples<br>
153 to 198 are shown in Tables 8 to 10 together with the results of Example<br>
152. As is clear from the results shown in Tables 8 to 10, many Examples<br>
clear the HD and DVD-R standard of the recording sensitivity of 10 mW or<br>
lower and PRSNR =15. In addition, the recording mechanism was of the<br>
Low-To-High type.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
[0200]<br>
The values of the recording sensitivity and recording characteristics<br>
may vary with the structure of dyes, the spectral form, the onset<br>
temperature of thermal decomposition of dyes, the kind of metal forming<br>
the complex, and others. For example, when Example 153 is compared<br>
with Example 157 that used the same' coupler component but has<br>
absorption shifted to a longer wavelength, Example 157 yielded a lower<br>
PRSNR value. Considering the above results, the recording performance is<br>
likely to be lowered when the λmax of the coating film of dyes departs<br>
substantially from 405 nm. This is because the recording principle is<br>
based on the Low-To-High type, and a certain degree of absorption is<br>
required at the recording wavelength. Therefore, it is obvious that a<br>
coupler component providing absorption at shorter wavelength is required<br>
to enhance the recording performance.<br>

ABSTRACT<br><br>
OPTICAL RECORDING MEDIUM, OPTICAL RECORDING<br>
MATERIAL AND METAL COMPLEX COMPOUND<br>
An optical recording medium is disclosed. The medium comprises: a substrate; and a<br>
