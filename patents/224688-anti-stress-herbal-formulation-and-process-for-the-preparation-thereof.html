				<td>The present invention relates to a synergistic novel herbal composition(s) with proven pharmacological activities such as anti stress, anti fatigue, adaptogenic and anti¬oxidant property.<br>
BACKGROUND AND PRIOR ART OF THE INVENTION<br>
In general, stress is subjective in the response of the organism to the stressor causing environmental stress, heat stress, cold stress, noise stress, stress from toxic chemicals etc. Response to stress is non-specific and independent of the nature of stressors so that the stress-induced state produced in subjects by diverse stressors is indistinguishable. The anti stress effect of the composition herein was determined by adopting a battery of tests (stress parameters) ex. Swimming performance stress, restraint stress in laboratory animals.<br>
Despite the tremendous studies and intensive research by medical scientists, therapy to build up non-specific resistance to aging, various ailments and recovery after illness and environmental changes is still as elusive as it was decades ago. Adaptogens are pharmacological agents that induce a non-specific increase of resistance of the organism to aversive stimuli that threaten to perturb internal haemostasis. The response to stress is non-specific and independent of the nature of the stress as the stress induced state produced by diverse stresses is indistinguishable. A host of experimental stress situations were used to provoke measurable physiological responses.<br>
The anti stress formulations known in the field or the antioxidants prevailing in the herbals though traditionally used, are not as much effective in the treatment of stress relief and that is the cause which incited the inventor to develop an anti tress herbal formulation with synergistic effect.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide a novel and therapeutically effective herbal composition with proven pharmacological activities and it's processing for the preparation of suitable oral dosage form with synergistic effect.<br><br>
The present invention relates to the use of a bio-availability and/or bio-efficacy and methods of their preparation which includes their isolation from natural source and obtaining the final products in their chemically characterized form.<br>
The Present invention also related to a new approach of increasing the bio efficacy of drugs had been conceptualized at applicant's Research and Development division. One group of herbals which has been documented very frequently.<br>
It is another object of the present invention to provide an alternative treatment option for subjects suffering from neurological disorders, anxiety and/or management of stress without any side effects.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a novel, therapeutically effective herbal composition(s) useful in the treatment of anti fatigue, anti stress agent and provides vitality and energy. The novel herbal composition comprises of decoction/extracts of Withania somnifera, Myhstica fragrans. Piper longum. Zingiber officinalis. Piper nigrum Alpina carmomum, Piper chaba, Embelia ribes, Aplotaxis auricuiata, Myristica caryophyllus, Bamboomanna, Hemidesmus indicus, Vanda roxburghii, Hypoxis orchioides, Cuminum cyminum, Nigella sativa, Asparagus racemosus, Ptychotis ajowan, Piper officinarum, Ipomea digitata. Curcuma zedorea, Lavandula Carnasa and Boerhavia diffusa. In a battery of tests like hypoxia and swimming endurance the synergistic effect of the composition showed 90% potency confirms the adaptogenic activity.<br>
The detail description of the plants used in the invention are having the following properties as reported.<br>
Withania somnifera	Family: Solanacea<br>
Botanical description: An erect, evergreen, grayish tomentose shrub 0.3- 2 m tall, with fairly long, stout, fleshy, whitish-brown roots. Leaves simple, alternate or subopposite, broadly ovate, glabrous, 5-12 cm long and 2.5 - 7 cm wide, apex subacute, base un equal, marginsentire, finely stellate-pubescent beneath; main nerves about 6 pairs; petioles 0.3-1.7 cm *r&gt;nn<br><br>
Phytochemistry: Two new withnolides-5-de hydroxy withnolide R and with a somniferin A isolated and their structure established (Phytochemistry 1991). Isolation of two new withnolides - sominone and sominolide and their characterization as 1 alpha, 3beta,27- trihydroxy 14 alpha, 15 alpha - epoxy l-oxo-22(R) with a-2, 24 dienolide respectively (heterocycles 1992). Withasomidienone isolated and characterized as 27hydroxy-3-ozo-22(R)- with a-I, 4, 24- trienolide (J. Nat. Prod 199]).<br>
Pharmacology: The roots are considered alternative, germicidal, aphrodisiac and diuretic; they are used in Ayurveda to treat ulcers, fever, dyspnoea, cough, consumption, dropsy, rheumatism, toxicosis and memory loss. The powdered roots mixed with equal parts of honey and ghee is thought to be beneficial for impotence or seminal debility. The roots as well as the bruised leaves are also used externally to treat ulcers, painful swellings and scabies. The total alkaloids present in the roots produce relaxant and anti spasmodic effects. The fruits and seeds are diuretic. The leaves are considered anthelmintic and bitter, and their infusion is given to relieve fever.<br>
Asparagus racemosus	Family: Asparagaceae<br>
Botanical description: A tall climbing, much-branched, spiny shrub with annual woody, white - grey or brown stems armed with strong, straight or recurved spines 0.5' - 1.3 cm long; rootstock short, tuberous, bearing numerous fusiform, succulent tuberous roots 30 100 cm long and 1-2 cm thick. Flowers white, fragrant, small, crowded in simple and branched racemes 5 - 15 cm long. Fruits globose, red when ripe. 3-lobed, 0.4 - 0.6 cm in diameter.<br>
Phytochemistry: Quercetin -3- glucuronide isoiared from leaves (CUIT, Sci 1969). Isolation of sitosterol, 4,6- dihydroxy -2- 0- (2-hydroxy isobutyl) benzaldehyde and undeconyl eetanoate from roots (1. Indian. Chern Soc. 1991). A new polycyclic alkaloid asperagonine A- isolated from roots and its structure determined by X-ray analysis (Chern. Pharm. Bull 1994).<br>
Pharmacology: In Ayurveda, the roots are considered alterative, stomachic, tonic, aphrodisiac and astringent. They are used to treat dysentery, tumours and inflammations. In unani the roots are used in the treatment of kidney and liver<br><br>
disorders. The fresh root juice mixed with honey is given to relieve dyspepsia. The leaf paste is used in combination with warm water baths to relieve scabies among the kadars of annamalai hills of Tamil Nadu.<br>
Zingiber officinale	Family: Zingiberaceae<br>
Botanical description: It is a small plant. The leaves are green, slender, flat and elongated. The stem is smooth and solid. The bulbs are composed of several bulbils (cloves), encased in white or pink skin of the parent bulb. The inflorescence is an umbel initially enclosed in a spathe. Ginger has been under cultivation from times immemorial.<br>
Medicinal uses: The therapeutic value of garlic in functional gastro- intestinal disorders was studied in 29 patients. A significant carminative effect, with a relief of nausea, gascolic, flatulence, belching and heaviness was observed. The effects of fried and raw garlic on blood showed an increase in fibrinolytic activity in 20 patients with ischaemic heart disease. A decrease in triglycerides and cholesterol has been observed. Garlic oil drops are put in the ears for infection and earache. Garlic is also used as an antiinfective agent topically and in other intercurrent infections.<br>
Phytochemistry: The strong smelling juice of the bulbs contain a mixture of aliphatic mono and polysulphides. The chief constituent is allicin, diallyl disulphide oxide. The latter results from spontaneous enzymatic reduction of allin and 5-allylcystine sulphamide. Thio- glycoside, aminoacids, fatty acids, flavonols, vitamins, trace elements, volatile oils etc. have also been demonstrateds.<br>
Pharmacology: Antibacterial and antifungal activity of garlic has been shown, by several investigators, against many common patho- genie organisms. Staphylococcus aureus, Escheiichia coli, Candida albicans, Shigella sonnei Salmonella typhi. Essential oils of garlic prevented an increase in a -lipoproteins, pre- a lipoproteins occurring after cholesterol-feeding in rabbits. Fibrinolytic activity was also significantly increased. Inhibition of platelet-aggregation in vitro and in vivo has also been demonstrated with garlic. There have been several studies showing the hypoglycaemic activity of garlic and allicin in animals.<br><br>
CURCUMA LONGA<br><br>
Family: Zingiberaceae<br><br>
Botanical description: The genus Curcuma comprising about fifty species, distributed in tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, belongs to the tribe Hedychieae and consists of a rather homogenous group of rhizomatous perennials. Govindarajan (1980 Food Science and Nutrition, 14: 119-301 and 1982 Food Science and Nutrition, 17: 1-258) published critical reviews on turmeric C. longa. The taxonomic status of Curcuma heyneana was discussed by Firman et al (1988 Phytochem. 27: 3887-3891) based on essential oil analysis. Tomlinson's (1969) work based on the anatomical evidence, which has much relevance in the classification of the order Zingiberales.<br>
Medicinal uses: Ethnobotanical details of some of the species of Curcuma has been reviewed and it was found that Curcuma is useful in the treatment of liver disorders and has a promising kind of broad spectrum hepatoprotective agent which is used in Indonesia (Lin et al., American J. Chin. Med.. ll;95 23:243-254). Curcuma longa was used predominantly for endoparasites, internal and external injuries and pregnancy related conditions in ethnic community of Trinidad and Tobago. Curcuma longa is used as dietary intake in Nepal (Eigner and Scholz, J Ethnopharmacol 1999, 67(1): 1-6).<br>
Phytochemistry: Essential oils are complex mixtures of odorous and steam-volatile compounds that are deposited in the subcuticular space of glandular hair, cell organells, idioblasts, excretory cavities and canals or exceptionally in hemlwoods. In other \vords, they are very complex, aromatic, volatile mixture containing many different compounds. The constituents of essential oils belong to numerous classes of chemical substances, such as hydrocarbons,, alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, acids, esters, oxides and ether (Thappa et al, J. Essent. Oil Res., 1982,11 :97-l 03). Essential oils largely comprises of terpenoid compounds, which constitute two or more isoprene units. Based on this, terpenoids are mainly classified into four groups viz. monoterpenes (with 2 isoprene units i.e. 10 carbon atoms) sesquiterpenes (with 15 carbon atoms), diterpenes (with 4 isoprine units i.e. 20 carbon atoms) and polyterpenes (with 5 or more isoprene units). These terpenoid compounds provide aroma and pungency to plants. The essential oil forms the basic raw materials for, perfume and flavour making industries. They are also used in the cosmetics and pharmaceutical industries. Many natural essential oils are used in aromatherapy to cure and prevent illness due to their therapeutic properties and also because of their fragrance which can influence human thoughts and emotions. Many of the essential oils are reported to have antimicrobial, insect repellent and insecticidal properties.<br><br>
Pharmacological use: The genus Curcuma exhibits diverse pharmacological activities against cancer and tumorgensis. Anto et al, Mutation Res., 1996, 370: 127-131, has reported the anticancer and antitumour properties of Curcuma longa. It was demonstrated that the inhibitory effect of curcumin on DNA and RNA synthesis in cultured HeLa cells. Dietary curcumin may inhibit azoxymethanol (40 M) induced colonic neoplasia in mice (Huang et al., Cancer Lett 1992, 64(2): 117-21). The antimicrobial properties are well known and the result reported by many researchers pointed out the antibiotic activities of Curcuma. Banerjee and Nigam (1. Res. Ind. Med. Yoga Homoeo., 1978, 13: 63-70) reported the antibacterial and antifungal activity of various species of Curcuma. Moliuscicidai property of C. longa was reported. The insecticidal property of different species of Curcuma. Curcumin showed anti-inflammatory effect in acute, subacute and chronic models of inflammation in mice and rat models. The oral ED50 in mice, against carrageenin-induced acute oedema was 100.2 mg/kg compared to 78 mg/kg of cortisone. Clinically curcumin did not produce any side effect up to ] 600mg/kg/day for 4 weeks in phase-I trials in male volunteers. Phase-II clinical trials have been conducted in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis. Curcumin inhibited rat liver microsomal delta 5 and delta 6 desaturases (Shimizu et al., L pids 1992, 27(7):509- 1 2). Curcuma contains an active principle(s) other than curcuminoid, which can modify the metabolism of lipid and lipoproteins. Several reports suggest that curcumin as well as turmeric increase bile flow. Essential oils of turmeric have also been found to increase the bile flow. However, some investigators have found it to be ulcerogenic (Prasad et ai. J. Physiol. Phannocol, 1976, 20, 92). The gastric secretion was found to be reduced after 3 h in conscious rabbits by aqueous and methanolic extracts of turmeric (Sakai et al. Chern. Pharm. Bull. 1989,37,215). Curcumin and turmeric have been shown to protect liver against a variety of toxicants in vitro as well as in vivo. They include carbon tetrachloride, aflatoxin B-l, paracetamol iron, and cyclophosphamide in mouse, rat and duckling. Evidence for the hypocholesterolemic and hypolipidemic activities of curcumin has been provided when it was fed with diet to rats for 7 weeks at the concentration of O. 1 5% (Rao et al. 1970 1. Nutri. 100, 1307). Ethanolic extract of Curcuma has been shown to have hypoglycemic activity in normal as well as alloxan - induced diabeties in rats. They have also isolated a I ipo polysaccharide from the root of Curcumin, which is similar to bacterial lipopolysaccharides and is immunostimulant (Inagawa et ai. Chern Pharm Bull 1992, 40, 1994). The wound healing property of turmeric was investigated long back and its local application was found to be effective (Gu/jral et al., 3. Ind. Med. Association 22, 273 1958). A sum of<br><br>
approximately 26 compounds has been isolated from different Curcuma sp. having high antioxidant activity. Curcumin did not produce any toxicity either on single administration or on repeated oral administration over a period of 6 months in rat and monkey at doses up to 800 and 1800-mg/kg day, respectively. Curcumin administered orally to patients suffering from chronic antieri or ureitis (CAU) at a dose of 375 mg three times a day for 12 weeks and all the patients who received curcumin alone improved (Lai et al., Phytother Res 13(4): 318-22, 1999).<br>
Zingiber officnale Linn.	Family:  Zinfiberacea<br>
Botanical description: A herbaceous rhizomatous perennial, reaching up to 90 cm in height under cultivation. Rhizomes are aromatic, thick lobed, pale yellowish, bearing simple alternate distiches narrow oblong lanceolate leaves. The herb develops several lateral shoots in clumps; which begin to dry when the plant matures. Leaves are long and 2-3 cm broad with sheathing bases, the blade gradually tapering to a point. Inflorescence solitary, lateral, radical, pendiculate oblong-cylindrical spikes. Flowers are rare, rather small, calyx superior, gamosepalous, three toothed, open splitting on one side, and corolla of three-sub equal oblong to lanceolate connate greenish segments. (The Wealth oflndia, NISCOM, D-23, C.S.I.R., New Delhi 1996).<br>
Medicinal use: Ginger, is carminative, pungent, stimulant, used widely for indigestion. It is chiefly used to cure diseases due to morbidity of kapha and vata. Ginger with limejuice and rock salt increases appetite and stimulates the secretion of gastric juices. It is said to be used for chronic bronchitis, cold, chest congestion, cough, difficulty in breathing, dropsy, sore throat, throat ache, stomachache, vomiting and rheumatism. Zinger forms an important constituent of many pharmacopoeal ayurvedic formulations. (Misra B, Bhavaprakasha Nighantu, 5th edi., 1969, p. 14.; Sharma P, Dravyaguna vigyan, part 2, Chauukhamba Publications 1993, p. 331; Indian medicinal plant, a compendium of 500 sps., Part 5, orient Longman Publication, 1997, p. 431; Nadkarni, Indian Materia Medica, vol 1, 1993, p. 1308; Yogaratnakra, Chauukhamba Publications 1993, p. 320330; Bhavaprakasha with Vaidyotina commentary by Misra BS; Chikitsa Prakarana Madhyana Khadana-Chauukhamba Publications 1980. p. 683-70 I ).<br>
Phytochemistry: Ginger has been reported to contain usually 1-3 % of volatile oil, pungent principles, viz. gingerols and shogaols and about 6-8 lipids and others.<br><br>
Ginger oil contains zingiberene and bisaboline as major constituents along with other sesqui and mono terpines. Ginger oleoresin contains mainly the pungent principles gingerols and shogaoas as welt as zingeberine. Shogaols have recently been found twice as pungent as gingerols. (KiuchiF, et. al., Chern. Phann. Bull, 1982, 30, 754; waigner H, et al.. Plant drug analysis, springer, 1996, 300; Akhila A and Tewari CROMAP, 1984, 6(3), 143146).<br>
Pharmacology: It is used for common cold, due to pathogenic wind cotd, characterized by severe intolerance to cold, slight fever, headache, general ache, congestion and running nose. Antihistaminic activity has been studied in ginger. Zingiber officinale was indicated in allergic conditions in traditional text. However they were following crude methods. Toyoda J, Chern. Abst., 1969, 71, 33425; Y ogaratnakra, Chauukhamba Publications 1993, p. 320-330; Bhavaprakasha with Vaidyotina commentary by Misra B. S; Chikitsa Prakarana Madhyana Khanda-Chauukhamba Publications 1980, p. 683-701).<br>
Piper longum, L.	Family-Piperacea<br>
Description: A slender, aromatic climber with perennial woody roots; stems jointed, creeping, young shoots downy. Leaves simple, alternate, 5-12cm long and3-6cm wide, glabrous, ovate base cord ate with broad rounded lobes, apex sub acute, and margins entire. Flowers minute on unisexual, axillary, cylindrical spikes; green at first, turning yellow, up to 5 cm long; male spikes longer than female. Fruits ovoid, yellowish orange turning dark red to blackish, sunk in fleshy spikes 2.5-3.8 cm long. Flowers during the rainy season and fruits during the autumn.<br>
Distribution and habitat: Considered native to tropical and subtropical India, Nepal, Bangladesh, Myannlar (Burma), and the Malay Peninsula. In India it is found from central Himalayan to Assam, the lower hills of west Bengal, and in the evergreen forest of peninsular India from konkan(Maharashtra) to Travancore(kerala).it is occasionally cultivated in north-eastern and southern India for its fruits, used as a spice and in pickles and preserves.<br>
Medicinal properties and uses: The dried roots, as well as the immature and mature fruits, are used extensively, alone and in combination with other plant drug to treat a broad range of ailments in traditional Indian medicine. The dried roots and thicker stems, known commercially as piplamul, are an important drug in the ayurvedic and unani systems. The roots and fruits' are used to treat dysentery and leucoderma, as a cholagogue for treating bileduct and gallbladder obstruction, and as a counter -irritant<br><br>
and analgesic for relieving muscularpains and inflammations. A decoction of dried immature fruit and root, or the powdered fruits mixed with honey, is used to treat chronic bronchitis, cough and cold. An infusion of the powdered fruits is given to women after childbirth to check bleeding and fever. It is as important ingredient in medicated oil used externally for sciatica and paraplegia.<br>
Myristica fragrans	Family: Myristicaceae<br>
A dioecious or occasionally monoecious evergreen, aromatic tree, usually 9-12 m. high, but sometimes reaching a height of 20 m. or more. Bark grayish black, longitudinally fissured in old trees; leaves elliptic or oblong-lanceolate, coriaceous; flowers in umbellate cymes, creamy yellow fragrant; fruits yellow, broadly pyriform or globose, 6-9, cm. Long, glabrous, often drooping: pericarp fleshy, 1.25 cm, thick, splitting into 2 halves at maturity; seed broadly ovoid, arillate, albuminous, with a shell-like purplish brown testa; aril red, Heshy laciniate.<br>
Chemical constituents: Nutmegs yield 5 to 15% of a volatile oil and also 30 to 405 of fat, photosterin, starch, amylodextrin, coloring matter, and a saponin (Trease and Evans, 1983). They yield about 3% of total ash and about 0.2% of acid-insoluble ash. Essential oil of mace is of a yellowish color with the odor of mace, and consists of macene. Mace (arillus) contains a volatile oil (8 to 17%), a fixed oil, resin, fat, sugar, destrin, and mucilage. The volatile oil (Oleum myristicae, British Pharmaacopoeia) contains pinene and camphene (80%), dipentene (8%), alcohols (about 6%), myristicin (about 4%), safrole (0.6%), and eugenol and isoeugenol (0.2%). By expression or by means of solvents, nutmegs yield a product known as "nutmeg butter" or expressed oil of nutmegs. This consists of 12.5% of volatile oil, 73%ofttimyristicin (the glyceride ofmyrisiic acid), small quantities of oleic, linoleic, and other acids, and about g.5% of unsaponifiable matter (Chopra et al., 1982). Varshney and Sharma (1968) found triterpenic saponin and 15% of free myristic acid in the seeds of M. fragrans. The arils yield a new neolignan, characterized as dl-dehydro-di- isoeugenol, and five other neolignans (Purushottaman and Sharda 1980), Raw nutmeg contained 1.5% of total polyphenols and 0.6% tannins. The extract of nutmeg revealed the presence of epicatechin and cyaniding (Gopalakrishnan and Mathew, 1983). Nutmeg is also reported to contain calcium, phosphorus, iron, thiamin, riboflavin and niacin (Gopalan etal., 1948).<br><br>
Pharmacological action: Nutmeg is aromatic, stimulant, and carminative; in large doses, narcotic. Mace is carminative and aphrodisiac. The extract of thy seed and essential oil showed antibacterial activity. The seed oil exhibited a depressent effect on isolated frog rectus and a direct relaxant effect on rat ileum (Kapoor 2001).<br>
Medicinal properties and uses: Essential oil is administered in atonic diarrhea and dysentery to relieve pain and is used in combination without stimulating oils for a stimulant action and in plasters for chronic rheumatism. A compound powder called Jatiphaladi churna made of nutmeg, Indian hemp, camphor, cardamon, cloves, bamboo manna and Plumbago zeylanica is used as a sedative, anodyne antispasmodic in asthma, colic, neualgia, menorrhagia, dysmenorrhea, spasmodic cough, and lumbago, in doses of 1 to 1.5 gr twice daily with honey. Mace is useful in low stages of fever, in consumptive complaints, and humoral asthma Roasted nutmeg is useful in obstructions of the liver and spleen.<br>
