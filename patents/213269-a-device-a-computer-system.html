.MHZJCI BUS RIDER CARD SYSTEM"<br>

INTEL CORPORATION, a corporation incorporated in the State of Delaware, of 2200 Mission College Boulevard, Santa Clara, California 95052, United States of America,<br><br><br>
The present invention relates to a device and a computer system.<br>
Field<br>
This invention relates to a"riser card topology for computer boards and, more particularly to a 66 MHz PCI bus riser card system capable of coupling one or more 5     peripheral boards to a PCI bus.<br><br>
General Background<br>
As computer systems evolve, there is an increasing need to provide more components, such as semiconductor devices, connectors, memory, etc" per square inch of board space. In some applications, such as web servers, part of this need has been<br>
10     addressed by employing a plurality of chassis arranged within a rack. A chassis is a<br>
L<br>
device designed to house or hold a computer board or circuit board. A plurality of chassis<br>
may then be closely arranged or stacked in a rack, which is often a cabinet-like structure.<br>
"The rack provides a common bus on to wich the computer boards may be connected for<br>
operation.	"<br>
15	In order to provide certain design standards, chassis enclosures are specified as<br>
1U, 2U, etc. "1U" defines a chassis that can house a circuit board no more than 1.75 inches high. "1U" systems are often deployed in data centers and host service provider sites to achieve maximum performance density. "2U" is defined as "2 x 1U" or 3.5 inches, and so on. As a consequence, these units of separation define the maximum height<br>
20     of computer boards, including all components and peripheral cards that can be deployed in such chassis.<br>
One way in which such performance density is achieved is by minimizing the number of connectors or sockets that are mounted on a board. However, this also limits the number of cards that may be connected onto the board.<br>
25	A significant problem also exists as a result of the limited spacing between each<br>
computer board. For instance, in a W system, a mere 1.75 inches in height are available to fit memory modules and peripheral cards. Because many connectors and sockets on a computer board are mounted vertical to the surface of the board, this prevents installing many peripheral cards as they would protrude beyond 1.75 jnches-in height<br>
30	One solution to this problem is to use a riser card which permits installation of<br>
peripheral cards in a horizontal position to the computer board. Generally, a "riser card" is<br><br><br><br><br>
a module which couoles to an existing connector or socket on the computer board and includes one or more connectors on the module onto which peripheral devices may be coupled. By making a riser card compact and mounting the connectors thereon m a horizontal position to the computer board, peripheral cards may be coupled to the riser card so as to fit within the 1.75-inch constraint of 1U systems.<br>
One common connector for peripheral cards is a Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI) socket." The PCI bus was proposed by Intel Corporation as a solution, to provide a high-speed expansion bus standard. The original PCI bus standard has been upgraded several times, with the current standard being Revision 2.2, available from a trade a&amp;sc .lauorL group reterred to as PCI Special Interest Group, 5440 Westgate Drive, Suite 217, Portland, Oregon 97221; also found at www.ncisip.com. The PCI Specification, .Rev. 2.2, is incorporated herein by reference. The PCI bus provides for 32-bit 6/64-"-it transfers at 33 MegaHertz (MHz) or 66 MHz. It can be populated with<br>
peripheral cards, including adapters, requiring fast access to each other and/or with system memory, and can be accessed by the host processor at speeds approaching that of the processor"s native bus speed. A 64-bit, 66 MHz PCI bus has a theoretical maximum transfer rate of 528 MegaBytes/sec.<br>
As the demand for faster computers has grown, the 66 MHz PCI bus has become common in computer systems. One consideration in the design of computer boards employing the 66 MHz PCI bus standard is signalreflection. Signal reflection occurs where a transmission signal crosses from a first transmission medium to a second transmission medium having different characteristic impedances. For instance, this is the case wheic a connector electrically couples a PCI bus to a peripheral card. Another source of reflection is where a single transmission path splits into two or more transmission paths.<br>
Thus, the addition of connectors and riser cards between onboard devices and PCI devices on peripheral cards causes a major signal quality problem on the 66 MHz PCI bus. As transrr-ssion frequencies increase, the disruption of signal waveforms caused by such reflection becomes increasingly problematic. Hence, in designing a computer board that includes a 66 MHz bus, transmission paths, including the sockets, riser cards, and peripheral ;ards, must be carefully considered in order to minimize signal reflection^<br>
Accordingly, there is a need for a compact riser card system which will provide two or more 64-bit PCI sockets to couple one or more peripheral boards to a 66 MHz PCI bus on a computer board while satisfying the height requirements for 1U systems.<br><br>

The connecting edge 106 may comply with the PCI standard specification and may include one or more electrical contacts 110 to electrically couple the primary riser card 100 to a PCI bus. In one embodiment of the invention, the distance between the connecting edge 106 and opposite edge 112 of the primary riser card is in the range of 0.25 inches to 1.75 inches. This is so that the primary riser card 100 will fit within the physical constraints of a 1U system  According to a second embodiment, the primary riser card 100 is approximately one (1) inch high.<br>
According to one embodiment of the invention, the primary riser card 100 may include one or more sockets 104 which may be electrically coupled to one or more of the<br>
electrical contacts 110. The term "socket", as used throughout this document, is defined to<br><br>
be synonymous and interchangeable with the term "connector". In one embodiment, the<br>

Figure 3A illustrates a side view of the primary riser card 100 of Figure 1. The one or more sockets 104 are mounted on a first surface of the primary riser card substrate 102 in such a manner that when the primary riser card 100 is coupled to a baseboard connector on a computer board, the combined structure does not exceed 1.75 inches in height. This allows a first peripheral card to be coupled to the primary riser card"s one or more sockets 104.<br>
Figure 3B illustrates a side view of an exemplary primary riser card 200 incorporating the one or more interboard connectors 216 and 218 (not shown) of Figure 2. These interboard connectors 216 and 218 may serve to couple a second peripheral card to the same PCI bus as a first peripheral card which may be coupled to the one or more sockets 204 on the primary riser card 200. According to another embodiment, the connectors 216 and 218 may serve to couple to a secondary riser card.

In various embodiments of the secondary riser card 500, the one or more interboard connectors 506 and 510 may be mounted on the same or opposite surface as the socket 404 (in Figure 4).<br>
Figure 6 illustrates a side view of a secondary riser card 600 configuration. In this configuration, the secondary riser card substrate 602 has a PCI socket 604 mounted on a first surface and at least one interboard connector 606 mounted on a second surface. According to one embodiment, the width, of the secondary riser card 600 is in the range of<br><br><br>
0.25 inches to 1.75 inches so that the secondary riser card 600 will fit within the physical constraints qfa_ 1U system. In another embodiment, the secondary riser card may have a PCI socket and the one or more connectors mounted on the same surface of the substrate.<br>
Figure 7A illustrates a side view of the interconnection of a primary riser card 702 and a secondary riser card 700. This configuration comprises of a primary riser card 702, including a substrate 710, a socket 706, and one or more interboard connectors 732, coupled to a secondary riser card 700, including a substrate 70S, a socket 704, and one or more interboard connectors 730.

Additionally, the primary and secondary riser cards 702 and 700 may also include one or more holes 720 and 722 through which a retaining mechanism or. fastener may fit to secure the two cards 700 and 702.<br>
One of the challenges of designing the riser cards described above to operate with a 66 MHz PCI bus is choosing transmission paths along the bus and interfacing<br><br><br>
components which will minimize signal reflection and meet the PCI revision 2.2 timing specifications. Through simulations and empirical testing, it has been discovered that a particular set of trace or signal path lengths accomplishes these goals.<br>
Figure 8A illustrates the signal transmission paths or traces for a PCI bus from a baseboard connector 802 or PCI socket on a computer board through a primary riser card and a peripheral card 806 coupled to the primary riser card. According to one embodiment of the invention, the signal path from the connector 804 on the primary jriser card should be no longer than approximately 1.4 inches. Jn a second embodiment, the trace or signal path may be between approximately 0.3 to 1.1 inches in length. The trace length on the peripheral card or PCI card is defined by the PCI Specification, Revision 2.2 for 66 MHz buses. In a first embodiment of the invention, the trace on the peripheral card should be no longer than approximately 2 inches in length. These values are illustrated in Figure 8B.<br>
Figure 9A illustrates the signal transmission paths or traces for a PCI bus from a baseboard connector 902 or PCI socket on a computer board through a primary riser card, without a peripheral card coupled to it, to a secondary riser card with a peripheral device 908 coupled to it. According to one embodiment of the invention, the signal path from the baseboard connector 902 to the interboard connector 904 on the primary riser card may be no longer than approximately 2 inches and preferably between approximately I to 1.7 inches in length. The signal path from the interboard connector 910 on the secondary riser card to the PCI connector 906 on the secondary card may be no longer than approximately 1.9 inches and preferably between approximately 0.2 to 1.6 inches in length. The trace length on the peripheral card 908 or PCI card is defined by the PCI Specification, Revision 2.2 for 66 MHz buses and may be no longer than approximately 2 inches in length. These values are illustrated in Figure 9B.<br>
Figure 10A illustrates the signal transmission paths or traces for a PCI bus from a baseboard connector 1002 or PCI socket on a computer board through both a primary riser card and a secondary riser card, each with a peripheral device 1012 and 1014 coupled to it, In one embodiment, the PCI bus operates at 66 MHz. In another embodiment, the PCI sockets on the primary and secondary riser cards are 64-bit PCI sockets. According to one embodiment of the invention, the signal path from the baseboard connector 1002 to the PCI socket 1004 on the primary riser card may be no longer than approximately 1.4 inches and preferably between approximately 0.3 to 1.1 inches in length. According to another<br><br><br>
embodiment, the signal path from the PCI socket 1004 to the interboard connector 1006 on<br>
the primary riser card may be no longer than approximately 1.5 inches and preferably<br>
between approximately 0.8 to 1.2 inches in length. In a third embodiment, the trace from<br>
the interboard connector 1010 on the secondary riser card to the PCI connector 1008 on<br>
the secondary card may be no longer than approximately 1.9 inches and preferably<br>
between approximately 0.2 to 1.6 inches in length. These trace lengths values are<br>
illustrated in Figure 10B.<br>
I Figure 11A illustrates a circuit board 1100 or computer board with a PCf bus and<br>
including a baseboard connector 1110 or PCI socket on which any of the primary and<br>
secondary riser card configurations shown in Figures 8A, 8B, 9A, 9B, 10A, and 10B may<br>
be coupled. This circuit board and components thereon is only one of many systems on<br>
which a primary and secondary riser card may be coupled.<br>
As shown, the PCI bus, identified as segments "C" and "D",_o.n the computer board 1100 is defined by the PCI Specification, Revision 2.2 and may include a host bridge 1102 and other PCI devices 11.04 which comply with the PCI Specification, Revision 2.2. While a host bridge 1102 and a generic PCI device 1104 are shown in Figure 11A, this is by way of illustration only and other devices may be employed. For instance, a Small Computer System Interface (SCSI) controller may be coupled to the PCI bus.<br>
According to a first embodiment of the invention, the trace or signal path between the host bridge 1102 and the PCI device 1104 should be a maximum of approximately 2 inches long. A "T" point 1106, defined by the intersection of segments "A", "B", and "C", is selected on this segment such that the trace length from this point to either of the host bridge 1102 and PCI device 1104 is no than approximately 1.2 inches, and preferably no longer than approximately 1 inch, and the total length to the baseboard connector is no more than approximately 8.5 inches, and preferably no longer than 7 inches.<br>
It must be noted that the point at which the host bridge 1102 and PCI device 1104 couple to the PCI bus may be anywhere along segments "C" or "D". That is, any of these devices may be coupled, alone or in combination, to the PCI bus anywhere along the bus without changing the character of the present invention. Additionally, PCI devices 1102 and 1104 need not couple at a "T" point 1106 as shown. In one embodiment, the host bridge 1102 may be coupled to segment "C" while the PCI device 1104 may be coupled to segment "D".<br><br><br><br>
In one embodiment of the invention an attenuation resistor 1108 is placed between the "T" point 1106 and the baseboard connector 1110. The function of the attenuation resistor 1108 is to attenuate reflection from the receivers on peripheral cards or PCI devices when the host-bridge 1102 is driving. According to one embodiment, the trace length from the attenuation resistor 1108 to the baseboard connector 1110 is no more than approximately 2.5 inches, and preferably no longer than approximately 2 inches. The trace length from the resistor 1108 to the "T" point 1106 should be no longer than approximately 6 inches, and preferably no longer than approximately 5 inches. According to one embodiment of the invention, the attenuation resistor 1108 may be less than or equal to approximately 200 Ohms.<br>
In another embodiment, a pull-up resistor 1112 at the baseboard connector 1110 may be present to couple to a voltage source 1114. The stub length from the pull-up resistor 1108 to the baseboard connector 1110 should be a maximum of approximately 1.2 inches, and preferably no longer than 1 inch. According to one embodiment of the invention, the pull-up resistor 1112 is less or equal to approximately 2K. Ohms.<br>
Figure 12 illustrates an exemplary configuration of how a primary riser card 1302 and a secondary riser card 1304 may be coupled to a circuit board 1306. In this embodiment, the secondary riser card 1304 is coupled to the primary riser card 1302. The primary riser card 1302 may be coupled to a socket 130S on the circuit board 1306.<br>
According to this configuration. ach riser card 1302 and 1304 may include a socket 1310<br>
and 1312 onto which a peripheral card may be coupled in a position substantially<br>
horizontal to the circuit board 1306.<br>
