Description<br>
CHARACTER INPUT METHOD FOR ADDING VISUAL<br>
EFFECT TO CHARACTER WHEN CHARACTER IS INPUT<br>
AND MOBILE STATION THEREFOR<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates generally to a mobile station, and in particular, to a<br>
character input method for adding various effects to a character displayed on a screen<br>
when the character is input and a mobile station therefor.<br>
Background Art<br>
Recently, as mobile stations have become more popular, they have incorporated<br>
additional functions so that users of the mobile stations can use the mobile stations for<br>
these additional functions in addition to a phone communication function. Moreover,<br>
in scope with the expansion of various services and additional functions, a mobile<br>
terminal's display screen size and color palette has also increased Due to the users'<br>
demands being more various and detailed than in the past, the screen space of the<br>
mobile stations must now be used more efficiently using various methods. Ac-<br>
cordingly, screen space should be used such that, various demands of the users are<br>
satisfied and a user is not inconvenienced.<br>
However, although current mobile stations can generate sound and images desired<br>
by users using a download service, when a recipient's number is input or a short<br>
message is edited, characters having the same font shape and/or size are typically used.<br>
For example, a mobile station displays a number having a single font shape il-<br>
lustrated in FIG. 1(A) when a user presses a key when dialing. The number having a<br>
normal size or double size as the font size. When the user continues to dial, input<br>
numbers fill a screen as illustrated in FIG. 1(B), and if the user continues to press more<br>
keys, the input numbers are converted to a smaller font size and displayed as illustrated<br>
in FIG. 1(C). When the user presses a "call" key, an image of trying to connect a call<br>
to the input recipient's number is displayed as illustrated in FIG. 1(D).<br>
FIG. 2 is a structural diagram illustrating a conventional dialing screen having a<br>
layered structure. The conventional dialing screen includes a background layer 10 for<br>
providing a single unicolor background image, a character input layer 20 for displaying<br>
key-input data according to a key press, and an icon layer 30 for informing of a current<br>
operation state according to the key press by displaying icons or images. That is, the<br>
icon layer 30 displays icons of various shapes, such as a telephone shape representing a<br>
conversation state and a speaker shape representing a sound setting item.<br>
Disclosure of Invention<br><br>
Technical Problem<br>
Accordingly, when a conventional mobile station displays key-input data input by a<br>
user when dialing, the conventional mobile station simply displays monotonous key-<br>
input data having an assigned font shape and size. That is, in the character display<br>
method described above, the mobile station does not allow the user to set various<br>
methods such as an assignment of the font size and color of characters.<br>
As described above, a conventional mobile station does not display a character by<br>
changing the font size and color of the character according to setting of a user when the<br>
character is input. Accordingly there is a need for a mobile station which can display a<br>
user selected font type, size, and color.<br>

Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
Preferred embodiments of the present invention will be described herein below with<br>
reference to the accompanying drawings. In the drawings, the same or similar elements<br>
are denoted by the same reference numerals even though they are depicted in different<br>
drawings. In the following description, well-known functions or constructions are not<br>
described in detail since they would obscure the invention in unnecessary detail.<br>
The present invention implements a function of displaying various character effects<br>
on a character input screen of a mobile station by using a differentiated graphic<br>
element according to a key input signal. To do this, a visual character theme set by a<br>
user is displayed in a character input mode, and a character input effect corresponding<br>
to the visual character theme is shown according to a key input signal. Accordingly,<br>
since the mobile station can show a visual character input effect for every key input<br>
sequence by allowing the user to select a desired visual character theme in advance, an<br>
entertaining effect can be added to a user interface of the mobile station.<br>
Components and operations of a mobile station having the function described above<br>
will now be described with reference to FIG. 3 which is a block diagram of a mobile<br>
station according to the present invention. Hereinafter, the character is the general term<br>
for any sign which can be displayed on a screen, such as an English character, a<br>
Korean character, a number, and a special character (e.g., "*", "!", etc).<br>
Referring to FIG. 3, the mobile station includes a controller 100, a key input unit<br>
110, a display unit 120, a memory 130, a radio frequency (RF) unit 140, and a sound<br>
processing unit 150.<br>
The controller 100 controls all operations of the mobile station, and particularly,<br>
controls the display unit 120 to display a character input effect according to a preferred<br>
embodiment of the present invention. Herein, the character input effect is displayed<br>
differently according to a pre-set visual character theme, and if effect sound is included<br>
in the visual character theme, the controller 100 controls the display unit 120 to display<br>
the character input effect and simultaneously controls the sound processing unit 150 to<br>
output the effect sound through a speaker every time a character is input.<br>
As described above, when a character display on a screen is requested by inputting<br>
a character, the controller 100 adds a visual effect corresponding to the pre-set visual<br>
character theme to the input character and displays the visual-effect-added character on<br>
a background image displayed according to the visual character theme. For example,<br>
the character input effect can be displayed in all character input modes such as a<br>
phone-call mode in which a user inputs a recipient's number to make a phone call and<br>
a message edit mode in which a message is input and/or edited.<br>
In another case, the controller 100 can display visual effect added characters even<br><br>
when a display of characters received through a Short Message Service (SMS) or a<br>
Multimedia Message Service (MMS) is requested. Herein, a message received from<br>
another party's mobile station through the SMS or MMS can be processed by a cor-<br>
responding message processing control unit included in the controller 100, i.e., an SMS<br>
or MMS character processing unit. For example, when a message according to a visual<br>
character theme is received, to display the message edited by the other party's mobile<br>
station, a corresponding message processing control unit determines whether a cor-<br>
responding visual character theme exists. If it is determined that the visual character<br>
theme exists, the corresponding message processing control unit displays visual-<br>
effect-added characters according to the visual character theme when the message is<br>
displayed. Likewise, it is preferable that a display of visual characters to which a visual<br>
effect according to a visual character theme is added be always applicable in all cases<br>
where a character display is required besides in the character input modes.<br>
The key input unit 110 provides an interface with the user, has various types of keys<br>
such as various function keys, number keys (e.g., 0 to 9), and special keys (e.g., * and<br>
#), and provides key input data corresponding to a key pressed by the user to the<br>
controller 100. That is, the key input unit 110 generates key input data unique to each<br>
key input signal and outputs the generated key input data to the controller 100. The<br>
controller 100 detects which key corresponds to the key input data and performs a cor-<br>
responding operation according to the detection result.<br>
The control unit 100 controls the display unit 120 to receive display data cor-<br>
responding to the key input data from the key input unit 110 and display the display<br>
data, or display an operational state and a plurality of types of information of the<br>
mobile station using icons and characters. In addition, when the user sets or operates a<br>
needed function, the control unit 100 controls the display unit 120 to visually display a<br>
state of the setting or operation so that the user is informed as required. Moreover, the<br>
display unit 120 to which the present embodiment is applied displays a visual character<br>
effect by which a visual effect is added to a character input by the user in the character<br>
input mode.<br>
The memory 130 is includes a ROM (Read Only Memory) and RAM (Random<br>
Access Memory) for storing a plurality of programs and data. In particular, according<br>
to a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the memory 130 stores data of a<br>
display item for each layer according to a visual character theme. The memory 130<br>
also stores a plurality of visual character themes and stores a visual character theme set<br>
by the user as a default visual character theme.<br>
The RF unit 140 is connected to the controller 100, converts sound data and control<br>
data to an RF signal and transmits the RF signal, and receives an RF signal and<br>
converts the received RF signal to sound data and control data.<br><br>
The sound processing unit 150 is connected to the controller 100, converts sound<br>
data input from the controller 100 to audible sound and outputs the audible sound<br>
through the speaker 160, and converts a sound signal received through a microphone to<br>
sound data and transmits the sound data to the controller 100. In addition, the sound<br>
processing unit 150 to which the present embodiment is applied outputs effect sound<br>
according to a corresponding visual character theme whenever a character input effect<br>
according to a character input is displayed on the screen. For example, if a visual<br>
character theme is "steel", a steel plate (not shown) is displayed as a background<br>
image, and when a key is pressed, a character corresponding to the key can be<br>
displayed on the steel plate as the character is carved on steel, and simultaneously, a<br>
striking hammer effect sound can be output through the speaker.<br>
A layered structure of a screen of a mobile station having the above-described con-<br>
figuration on which a predetermined character input effect is displayed when a<br>
character is input will now be described.<br>
FIG. 4 is a schematic structural diagram of layers of a character input screen in a<br>
mobile station according to the present invention. The character input screen of the<br>
mobile station according to the present invention basically includes a background layer<br>
200 for displaying a background image according to a visual character theme and a<br>
character input layer 220 for displaying an input character by not changing a font of<br>
the character but adding a visual effect to the character, and further includes a character<br>
effect layer 210 for displaying a pre-defined specific visual effect on a background<br>
portion on which the input character is displayed or on the entire screen in order to add<br>
a visual effect to the input character and an icon layer 230 for displaying images of<br>
various input tools when the character is input. Herein, the visual effect is usually<br>
overlapped on the background image of the visual character theme provided by the<br>
background layer 200, so that the character can be visually distinguished from the<br>
character effect. In addition, an icon indicating an input device provided by the icon<br>
layer 230 is overlapped on the background image of the visual character theme, as well<br>
as the character and the character effect.<br>
In more detail, the background layer 200 displays the background image of the<br>
visual character theme using the entire screen (or a substantial portion thereof) of the<br>
mobile station. According to a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the<br>
character effect layer 210 can display various effects, such as a wave effect or a flame<br>
effect, around a location of a displayed cursor or at which characters are being<br>
displayed. For example, when the background image of the visual character theme is a<br>
lake, a character is displayed by the character input layer 220 on the lake background<br>
image provided by the background layer 200, and then the character effect layer 210<br>
can give such an effect that tiny waves rise below a current cursor, below displayed<br><br>
characters, and/or all over the screen. By doing this, a character is displayed on water<br>
in what appears to be three dimensions. Additionally, an effect of tiny waves rising and<br>
falling can be provided when a character is input.<br>
To add a visual effect to a character corresponding to each key input signal, the<br>
character input layer 220 displays the character using various graphic elements and<br>
various fonts, such as an ink pen font, a light bulb font, a Post-it™ font, and a twinkle<br>
font. The icon layer 230 displays an ink-pen image as an input tool image when a<br>
visual effect added character, for instance, having the ink-pen font, is displayed by<br>
overlapping the background image (e.g., letter paper image) of the visual character<br>
theme. For example, when the visual effect added character is displayed, the icon layer<br>
230 displays an image indicating an input tool tracing strokes of the character in order<br>
to give a feeling of writing the character for a user. While the character strokes are<br>
being drawn according to a drawing sequence, the image indicating the input tool si-<br>
multaneously moves to trace the character strokes, and when the character is fully<br>
drawn, the image indicating the input tool is displayed at the ending point of the<br>
character strokes. Additionally, an optional scratching sound (e.g., a sound similar to a<br>
quill scratching paper as it draws a character can be played by the speaker as the<br>
character is drawn.<br>
The character input screen is provided to the user as illustrated in FIG. 5, and a<br>
character input effect corresponding to each visual character theme is displayed when<br>
the user inputs a character. According to a preferred embodiment of the present<br>
invention, visual character themes having various character input effects, such as an<br>
ink pen theme illustrated in FIG. 5(A), an LED panel theme illustrated in FIG. 5(B), a<br>
twinkle theme illustrated in FIG. 5(C), a Post-it™ theme illustrated in FIG. 5(D), a<br>
steel theme illustrated in FIG. 5(E), and a blackboard theme (not shown), can be used.<br>
While FIG. 5 illustrates the ink pen, LED panel, twinkle, Post-it™, and steel themes<br>
according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the present invention is<br>
not limited to this. That is, visual character themes having various character input<br>
effects can be displayed according to a selection of the user, a service provider, or a<br>
mobile station manufacturer. In addition, the character input effects according to a<br>
preferred embodiment of the present invention can be created by the user, or received<br>
by a content provider as a kind of content and modified according to a selection of the<br>
user.<br>
There are various methods of displaying a visual-effect-added character on the<br>
character input layer 220 according to the present invention. Three of these methods<br>
will now be described below.<br>
The first method of displaying a visual-effect-added-character is known as an<br>
animated pen input method in which a character is drawn to trace strokes of the<br><br>
character corresponding to a key input signal as writing the character for the user when<br>
a key is pressed, i.e., a method of inputting a character by adding an animation effect<br>
thereto. In this method, animated pen input data of each input character is stored in the<br>
mobile station, a corresponding visual character theme is set, and then if a certain<br>
character is input to the character input screen, animated pen input data corresponding<br>
to the input character is displayed. Although a method of storing and displaying<br>
animated pen input data of each input character is illustrated, it is also possible to set<br>
an animated pen effect and move an animated pen to trace an input character by adding<br>
drawing sequence information of the input character to the animated pen effect. When<br>
this animated pen effect is used, the animated pen input method can be used not only<br>
when a simple number key is pressed but also when a character having a high degree<br>
of freedom, such as a drawing input through a touch screen or a separate input tool, is<br>
input.<br>
To describe in more detail the animated pen input method, reference will be made<br>
to FIG. 5(A), which illustrates the ink pen theme as a visual character theme. This<br>
method is achieved by allocating a drawing sequence of a corresponding character to<br>
each key in advance. For example, when a number key is pressed for dialing, the<br>
controller 100 of the mobile station obtains a drawing sequence allocated in advance to<br>
correspond to the input number and draws character strokes of the input number<br>
according to the drawing sequence. When a character other than a number is input,<br>
strokes of the input character are also drawn according to a drawing sequence of the<br>
character, thereby being displayed on the screen. Besides, for the LED panel theme il-<br>
lustrated in FIG. 5(B), when a character key is pressed, a character corresponding to<br>
the character key is displayed in a form of illuminating LEDs according to a drawing<br>
sequence of the character. As another example, for the twinkle theme illustrated in<br>
FIG. 5(C), when a character key is pressed, a character corresponding to the character<br>
key is displayed in a form of sequentially flashing starlight on a universe background<br>
image according to a drawing sequence of the character.<br>
The second method of displaying a visual-effect-added-character is known as a<br>
collage method of displaying a character by loading a stored character image cor-<br>
responding to a key input signal when a key is pressed. For example, referring to the<br>
Post-it™ theme illustrated in FIG. 5(D), when a number key is pressed, a number<br>
image having a Post-it™ form corresponding to the number key is loaded and<br>
displayed. That is, character images are loaded and displayed one-by-one when keys<br>
are pressed in a feeling of attaching "Post-it™" on a cork wall or other background.<br>
The third method of displaying a visual-effect-added-character is known as a relief<br>
method of displaying a character as embossing or intaglioing the character when a key<br>
is pressed. For example, referring to the steel theme illustrated in FIG. 5(E), when a<br><br>
number key is pressed, a number corresponding to the number key is displayed as<br>
being raised in relief on a steel plate. Likewise, effects according to each visual<br>
character theme can be variously provided.<br>
A process of setting one of visual character themes displayed variously as described<br>
above will now be described with reference to FIG. 6 which is a flowchart illustrating a<br>
process of setting a visual character theme according to the present invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 6, the controller 100 determines in step 600 whether a request to<br>
change a visual character theme is input by a user. The request can be achieved by the<br>
user selecting a visual character theme change menu from a main menu. As a result of<br>
the determination in step 600, if a request to change a visual character theme is input,<br>
the controller 100 displays a default visual character theme in step 610. In step 620, the<br>
controller 100 determines whether a left or right direction key is pressed. That is, for<br>
the user's convenience, the user can see another visual character theme using the<br>
direction key in the present embodiment. As a result of the determination in step 620,<br>
if the left or right direction key is pressed, the controller 100 rotationally displays<br>
another visual character theme in a left or right direction according to the key input<br>
signal in step 630. In step 640, the controller 100 determines whether one of a plurality<br>
of visual character themes is selected by the user. As a result determined in step 640, if<br>
a certain visual character theme is selected, the controller 100 stores the selected visual<br>
character theme as the default visual character theme in step 650. Thereafter, the user<br>
can use a desired visual character theme.<br>
A process of displaying the visual character theme selected as described above will<br>
now be described with reference to FIG. 7 which is is a flowchart illustrating a process<br>
of adding a visual effect to character using a layered structure of a character input<br>
screen according to the present invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 7, if a character input mode is selected by the user in step 700, in<br>
step 710, the controller 100 loads a stored default visual character theme and sets the<br>
character input screen using the default visual theme. That is, the controller 100<br>
displays a background image corresponding to the default visual character theme on<br>
the character input screen through the background layer 200. Herein, if the default<br>
visual character theme is achieved in a manner of writing a character for the user, an<br>
input tool image is displayed through the icon layer 230 (e.g., a corresponding anim<br>
ated pen is displayed on the background image). In step 720, the controller 100<br>
determines whether a character key is pressed. Herein, the character key is a key for<br>
inputting any sign which can be displayed on a screen, such as an English character, a<br>
Korean character, a number, and a special character.<br>
If a character key is pressed, the controller 100 displays a character input effect<br>
according to the default visual character theme in response to a key input signal cor-<br><br>
responding to the character key in step 730. In more detail, when the key input unit<br>
110, for instance, senses that the user presses the character key and transmits key input<br>
data to the controller 100, the controller 100 adds a visual-effect-corresponding to the<br>
default visual character theme to an input character according to the key input data.<br>
Then, the controller 100 displays the visual-effect-added character on the background<br>
image displayed according to the default visual character theme. In step 740, the<br>
controller 100 determines whether another key is pressed within a predetermined time,<br>
i.e. whether a character key is further pressed. As a result of the determination in step<br>
740, if another a character or key is pressed, the controller proceeds to step 730 and<br>
displays an input-visual-effect-added character on the background image according to<br>
the default visual character theme by following the displayed character.<br>
A detailed example using the present invention will now be described with<br>
reference to FIGs. 8 and 9.<br>
FIG. 8 is a flowchart illustrating a method of providing a character input effect<br>
according to the present invention, and FIG. 9 illustrates screen shots showing the<br>
character input effect according to the present invention.<br>
Although an example will now be described by illustrating FIGs. 8 and 9, the<br>
method of providing a character input effect according to a preferred embodiment of<br>
the present invention should not be construed as limited to the embodiment shown in<br>
FIGs. 8 and 9.<br>
Referring to FIGs. 8 and 9, if a phone call mode is selected in step 800 by the user<br>
in the layered screen structure illustrated in FIG. 4, the controller 100 sets a character<br>
input screen using a stored visual character theme in step 805. That is, a background<br>
image corresponding to the default visual character theme is displayed through the<br>
background layer 200. Herein, if the default visual character theme is a light bulb<br>
theme, an LED panel background image is displayed through the background layer<br>
200. In step 810, the controller 100 determines whether a key for dialing is pressed. As<br>
a result in the determination in step 810, if a key for dialing is pressed, the controller<br>
100 displays a pre-defined character input effect on the background image in response<br>
to a key input signal corresponding to the key in step 815. For example, an effect of il-<br>
luminating light bulbs as illustrated in FIG. 9A is displayed. Herein, the effect can be<br>
achieved by sequentially illuminating the light bulbs displayed on the LED panel<br>
background image according to a drawing sequence of a character corresponding to the<br>
key or illuminating the light bulbs at once.<br>
In step 820, the controller 100 determines whether another key is pressed within a<br>
predetermined time. As a result of the determination in step 820, if another key is<br>
pressed, the controller 100 determines in step 825 whether the number of characters<br>
which can be displayed on the screen is exceeded. As a result of the determination in<br><br>
step 825, if a character corresponding to the key can be displayed on the screen, the<br>
controller 100, by proceeding back to step 815, adds the character input effect to the<br>
character and displays the character on the screen next to the previously displayed<br>
character. While repeating the above-described procedures in the same manner<br>
according to subsequently pressed keys, the controller 100 determines in step 825<br>
whether the number of characters which can be displayed on the screen is exceeded.<br>
As a result of the determination in step 825, if the number of characters which can be<br>
displayed on the screen is exceeded, i.e., if the screen is filled up by input characters as<br>
illustrated in FIG. 9B, the controller 100 changes a current image to an image having a<br>
smaller sized font as illustrated in FIG. 9(D) in step 830. Herein, to present a visually<br>
pleasing effect when the images are changed, the controller 100 may display a zoom-<br>
out image for temporarily displaying a flash on the LED panel background image as il-<br>
lustrated in FIG. 9(C).<br>
In a state where a recipient's number is input as illustrated in FIG. 9(D), the<br>
controller 100 determines in step 835 whether a call connection key for trying to make<br>
a phone call with the recipient's number is pressed. As a result of the determination in<br>
step 835, if the call connection key is pressed, the controller 100 displays a calling<br>
image according to a visual character theme illustrated in FIG. 9(F) in step 840.<br>
Herein, when the recipient's number input image is changed to the calling image, the<br>
controller 100 may also display a zoom-out image illustrated in FIG. 9(E).<br>
While the invention has been shown and described with reference to a certain<br>
preferred embodiment thereof, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that<br>
various changes in form and details may be made therein without departing from the<br>
spirit and scope of the invention. For example, while a visual character effect has been<br>
described only for a character input mode and a message receiving mode, the visual<br>
character effect can be applied to various modes in which a visual character can be<br>
displayed. Therefore, the spirit and scope of the invention will be defined by the<br>
appended claims and the equivalent not by the described preferred embodiments.<br><br>
