TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0001]<br>
The present invention relates to a disposable wearing article such as, for example, a disposable diaper, a training pant, a diaper for incontinent patient, a pant to fold urine-absorbent pad and a diaper pad. BACKGROUND ART OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002]<br>
WO 01/87209 Al (PATENT DOCUMENT 1) discloses a process for making absorbent garment. A training pant obtained using this process comprises a body fluid absorbent chassis and a fastening system. The chassis is provided in front and rear waist regions with elastic members stretchably extending in a waist surrounding direction. A hook part and a loop part of a mechanical fastener constituting the fastening system are attached to the chassis so that these hook and loop parts extend across the elastic members. PATENT DOCUMENT 1: WO C1/87209 Al DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br><br>
PROBLEM TO BE SOLVED BY THE INVENTION<br>
[0003]<br>
In the training pant disclosed in PATENT DOCUMENT 1, the<br>
chassis is formed with gathers as the elastic members contract and thereupon the hook part as well as the loop part both attached to the chassis also may be formed with gathers. The hook part most commonly used has a relatively high stiffness and, if such hook part Ls used in the training pant, the hook part will be substantially free from such formation of gathers. However, in the case of the training pant using the hook part having a lower stiffness, i.e., more soft and flexible hook part, the hook part is also apt to be formed with gathers. If the hook part is formed vith gathers, some of many hooks formed on the hook part will'be laid low in troughs of these gathers and unable to come in engagement with the loop part. The number of effective hooks is thus decreased and the hook part will be easily disengaged from the loop part. Compared to the hook part which is flat and The loop part engaged with such hook part, the hook part formed with gathers and the loop part engaged with such hook part are readily disengaged from each other as these two parts are pulled in opposite directions, because a so-called peeling force is easily generated between these two parts. As will be apparently understood from the<br><br>
foregoing description, the formation of gathers on the hook part is undesirable fo:: the disposable wearing article, and the formation of gathers on the loop part is also undesirable. In the same case the mechanical fastener can be replaced with a fastener comprising a sticky sheet coated with an adhesive agent and a sheet constituting a target zone for the sticky sheet. And gathers on the sticky sheet and the target sheet are also undesirable. [0004]<br>
It is an object of the present invention to improve the wearing article provided with such a fastener as a mechanical fastener so that at leas: a part of the fastener is formed with none of gathers even when the elastic members of the wearing article contract.

DESCRIPTION OF THE BEST MODE FOR WORKING OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0016]<br>
Details of the disposable wearing article according to the present invention will be mere fully understood from the description of a disposable diaper as a typical embodiment of the invention given hereunder with reference to the accompanying drawings.<br><br>
[0017]<br>
Fig. 1 is a perspective view showing a disposable diaper 1 basically comprising a body cover 2 and a body fluid absorbent panel 3. The body covet: 2 defines a crotch region 8, a front waist region 6 extending forward from the crotch region 8 and a rear waist region 7 extending reward from the crotch region 8. The regions 6, 7, 8 are formed from a first sheet facing the wearer's garment (not shown), i.e., an outer sheet 5 and a second sheet facing the wearer's skin (not shown), i.e., an inner sheet 4. A pair of flaps 9 formed from a third sheet provided separately of the inner and outer sheets 4, 5 are attached by means of bonding or welding to transversely opposite side edge portions 12 of the rear waist region 7 at spots 13 arranged intermittently in a vertical direction as viewed in Fig. 1. Since the side edge portion 12 and the flap 9 is attached to each other in flat, the flap 9 has a tendency to overlap by itself with the outer sheet 5 in the front waist region 6. Each of the flaps 9 is provided on inner surface thereof with a loop part 16 constituting a part of a mechanical fastener well known, for example, by the trademark "Velcro" or "Magic Tape". To cooperate with the loop part 16, the front waist region 6 is provided on its outer surface of each side edge portion 11 with a hook part 17 constituting a part of the<br><br>
mechanical fastener. The hook part 17 is attached by means of bonding or welding 1:o the outer surface of each side edge portion 11. By pressing the loop part 16 and hook part 17, both of which constitute a fastening means of the diaper 1, against each other, the front and rear waist regions 6, 7 are detachably connected with each other along the mutually facing side edge portions 11, 12 through the flap 9. Fig. 1 illustrates the diaper L in the state wherein one of the side edge portions 11 has been connected with one of the side edge portions 12 and the other of the side edge portions 11 is not connected with the other of the side edge portions 12. Upon connection of both of the side edge portions 11 with both of the side edge portions 12, the diaper 1 is formed with a waist-hole 18 and a pair of leg-holes 19. The diaper 1 formed in this manner further includes waist-surrounding elastic members 20 extending along the waist-hole 18 and leg-surrounding elastic members 19a respectively extending along the leg-holes 19. The body cover 2 is formed with gathers 66, 67 undulating in the waist surrounding direction and in the leg surrounding direction, respectively, as those elastic members 20, 19a contract. [0018]<br>
Fig. 2 is a partially cutaway plan view showing the diaper<br><br>
1. Fig. 2 illustrates the diaper 1 developed by disconnecting the side edge portions :.l of the front waist region 6 from the flaps 9 provided on the side edge portions 12 of rear waist region 7. The diaper 1 has a width direction indicated by a double-headed arrow K and a back-and-forth direction orthogonal to the width direction indicated by a double-headed arrow Y. The width direction X corresponds to the waist surrounding direction. Of the body cover 2, the front region 6 has a dimension measured between its side edge portions 11, 11 having generally the same dimension as that of the rear region 7 measured between its side edge portions 12, 12. The front and rear waist regions 6, 7 respectively have a front end portion 26 and a rear end portion 27 both extending in the width direction. Transversely opposite side edge portions 28 of the crotch region 8 curve inward to describe circular arcs which are convex inward. The waist-surrounding elastic members 20 provided on the body cover 2 comprise at least a single first elastic member 21a for the front waist region 6 attached in a stretched state to the front end portion 26 so as to extend between the side edge portions 11, 11; at least a single first elastic member 21b for the rear waist region 7 attached in a stretched state to the cear end portion 27 so as to extend between the side edge portions 12, 12; a plurality of second<br><br>
elastic members 22a for the front waist region 6 attached in a stretched state to a zone of the front waist region 6 defined between the first elastic member 21a (See Fig. 1) and the side edge portion 28 of the crotch region 8 so as to extend between the side edge portions 1 ., 11; and a plurality of second elastic members 22b for the rear waist region 7 attached in a stretched state to a zone of the rear waist region 7 defined between the first elastic member 21b and the side edge portion 28. of the crotch region 8 so as to extend between the side edge portions 12, 12. The respective first elastic members 21a, 21b have a stretch (or tensile) stress higher than that of the respective second elastic members 22a, 22b so that these first elastic members 21a, 21b may be pressed against the wearer' s waist more tightly than the respective second elastic members 22a, 22b. The body cover 2 further includes the leg-surrounding elastic members 19a attached ir. a stretched state to the side edge portions 28 of the crotch region 8. The waist-surrounding elastic members 20 and le g-sunrounding elastic members 19a are interposed between the inner sheet 4 and the outer sheet 5 and bonded to the sheets 4, 5 except the vicinity of the hook part 17 as will be described in detail with reference to Figs. 5 and 6. Preferably, the elastic members 20, 19a are intermittently bonded to those sheets 4, 5.<br><br>
[0019]<br>
As depicted in F:.g. 2, the body fluid absorbent panel<br>
3 comprises a liquid-pervious upper sheet 32, a liquid-impervious lower sheet 33 and a body fluid absorbent core 34 interposed between thesse two sheets 32, 33. The upper and lower sheets 32, 32 extend outward beyond a surrounding edge of the core 34 and the extensions of these sheets 32, 33 are overlapped and adhesively bonded or welded together. Transversely opposite side edge portions of such body fluid absorbent panel 3 are provided with leak-barrier cuffs 36 preferably formed from liquid-impervious sheet. Each of the leak-barrier cuffs 36 is attached to the upper sheet 32 at its front and rear end portions 37, 38 and along its outer side edge portion 39 but not attached to the upper sheet 32 along its inner side edge portion 41. An elastic member 42 extending in the back-and-forth direction Y is bonded in a stretched state to the inner side edge portion 41. The leak-barrier cuffs 36 formed in this manner respectively define pockets 43 adapted to receive body fluids flowing in the width direction X. The body fluid absorbent panel 3 has its lower sheet 33 bonded to the inner sheet 4 of the body cover 2 by means of hot melt adhesive (not shown). [0020]<br><br>
Fig. 3 is a sectional view taken along the line III-III in Fig. 2. In the body cover 2, the side edge portions 12 of the rear waist region 7 are overlapped and attached to the respective flaps 9 at the spots 13. In each of the side edge portions 12, the first and second elastic members 21b, 22b for the rear waist region ' are interposed between the inner and outer sheets 4, 5 and intermittently bonded to the sheets 4, 5. These elastic members 21b, 22b extend to the spots 13. It should be understood here that the first elastic members 21b can not be seen in Fig. 3. The flap 9 is attached to the associated side edge portion 12 so that the flap 9 is not peeled off from the side edge portion 12 even when the flap 9 is pulled in the width direction X. A base sheet 47 constituting a loop part 16 is attached to the inner surface of the flap 9 and the loop part 16 has a plurality of loops 45 formed on the base sheet 47. [0021]<br>
Figs. 4 and 5 are sectional views taken along lines IV-IV and V-V, respectively, in Fig 2. In the body cover 2, the side edge portions 11 of the front waist region 6 are provided with the hook parts 17. each comprising a base sheet 48 attached to the outer surface of the outer sheet 5 and a plurality of hooks 4 9 rising from this base sheet 48 as fastening elements.<br><br>
Referring to Fig. 4, the inner sheet 4 of the body cover 2, the outer sheet 5 and the second elastic members 22a are bonded together by means of a hot melt adhesive 51 intermittently in a longitudinal directioa of the: second elastic members 22. It should be minded here that a region 52 of the outer sheet 5 placed on and bonded tc the base sheet 48 and regions 53, 54 of the outer sheet 5 lying on both sides of the base sheet 4 8 in the width direction X and having width dimensions m and n measured from the respective side edges 50 of the base sheet 48 are bonded neither to the inner sheet 4 nor to the second elastic members 22a. the dimensions m and n are preferably in a range of 2 to 20 mm. Referring to Fig. 5, a region 52 of the outer sheet 5 placed on the base sheet 48 of the hook part 17 and regions 56, 57 of :.he outer sheet 5 lying on both sides of the base sheet 48 in the back-and-forth direction and having width dimensions s and t measured from the respective side edges 50 of the base sheet 48 are not bonded to, i.e., free from a part of the first elastic members 21a, the second elastic members 22a and the inner sheet 4. In regions extending outward from the regions 52, 56, 57, i.e., in regions spaced from the regiors 56, 57 by the dimensions s and t, respectively, the outer sheet 5 is bonded to the first elastic members 21a, the leg-surrounding elastic members 19a and the<br><br>
inner sheet 4 by means of the hot melt adhesive 51<br>
intermittently in the back-and-forth direction Y.<br>
[0022]<br>
Fig. 6 is a view similar to Fig. 4 showing a side edge portion 11 when an elastic member 20 is in a contracted state and Fig. 7 is a view sinilar to Fig. 4 showing the side edge portion 11 when a side edge portion 12 is connected to the side edge portion 11 through the flap 9. When the elastic members 20 contract in the body cover 2, the inner and outer sheets 4, 5 attached to the elastic members 20 contract in the width direction X and a plurality of fine gathers 66 undulating in the waist-surrounding d Lrection appear in the inner and outer sheet 4, 5. However, in the side edge portions 11 of the front waist region 6 the regions 52, 53, 54 of the outer sheet 5 which are attached neither to the inner sheet 4 nor to the second elastic member 22a part from the inner sheet 4 so as to buldge outwardly of the diaper (See Fig. 4) . At this stage the base sheet 48 of the hook 17 maintains its flat state, even if the stiffness of the base sheet 48 is not so high, because the base sheet 48 is attached to the outer sheet 5 and the outer sheet 5 is attached neither to the inner sheet 4 nor to the second elastic members 20. The regions 53, 54 of the outer sheet 5 slant as depicted by the drawing and may make gathers in some<br><br>
cases. The hook part 17 in this condition all of the hooks 49 stand elect outwardly of the diaper 1 on the base sheet 48 and so easily engage with the Loops 45 of the loop part 16 as depicted by Fig. 7. When the side edge portions of the rear waist region 7 is pulled to the left in Fig. 7, the gathers disappears by extension, of a zone 53 of the outer sheet 5 as shown in Fig. 7. [0023]<br>
In the diaper 1 constructed in this manner, even if the base sheet 48 of the hook part 17 is rather flexible in such an extent that the sti ffness of the base sheet 48 is slightly higher than that of the outer sheet 5, the base sheet 48 is substantially not affected by contraction of the elastic members 20 and still in a flat state. It is thus ensured that all of the hooks 49 constituting the hook part 17 can be easily engaged with the loop part 16 and these part 16, 17 having been once engaged with each other are not easily disengaged from each other. Of the body cover 2, the inner and outer sheets 4, 5 may be formed from a material selected from the group including a nonwoven fabric, a plastic film and a woven fabric. At least one of the two sheets 4, 5 may be formed from a liquid-impervious sheet to improve a leak-barrier property of the diaper 1. The flap 9 also may be formed from a material<br><br>
or a combination of materials selected from the group including a nonwoven fabric, a plastic film and a woven fabric. It is also possible to use a sheet which is elastically stretchable in the width direction X as the material for the flap 9. While Fig. 2 illustrates the elastic members 20 as being arranged in the same layout in the front and rear waist regions 6, 7, the layout of the elastic members 20 may be appropriately varied in each of these two waist regions 6, 7. It is also possible to eliminate the elastic members 20 partially or entirely in the rear waist region 7 without departing from the scope of the invention While the illustrated diaper 1 comprises the body cover 2 and the body fluid absorbent panel 3 provided separately of the body cover 2, the core 34 of the body fluid absorbent panel 3 may be sandwiched between the liquid-pervious inner sheet 4 and the liquid-impervious outer sheet 5 so that these components 2, 3, 34 may be combined into an integral structure. [0024]<br>
Fig. 8 is a view similar to Fig. 5, showing one preferred embodiment of the invantion. According to this embodiment, the outer sheet 5 is bonded to three first elastic members 21a for the front waist region 6 and the inner sheet 4 by means of a hot melt adhesive 51 in the front end portion 26 in each<br><br>
of the side edge portions 11 and the base sheet 48 of the hook part 17 is bonded alone its respective side edges 50 to the outer sheet 5. Of the outer sheet 5, a major part of the region 52 placed upon the base sheet 48 and the region 57 extending downward (upward as vievred in Fig. 8) from one of the side edges 50 of the base sheet 48 are bonded neither to the second elastic members 22a nor to the inner sheet 4. With such a unique arrangement of the hook part 17 on the body cover 2, the contraction of the elastic members 20 may result in the formation of gathers along the front end portion 26 but the major portion of the hook part 17 located aside from the front end portion 26 toward the crotch region 8 is free from the formation of the gathe::s. The; object of the invention can be achieved also by the diaper 1 having the side edge portions 11 arranged in such a manner. [0025]<br>
Fig. 9 is a view similar to Fig. 8, showing another preferred embodiment of the invention. The side edge portions 11 in this embodiment comprises the inner sheet 4, the outer sheet 5 and the elastic members 20 formed in the manner similar to the case depicted in Fig.. 8. However, the base sheet 48 constituting the hook part 17 has a length shorter than the base sheet 48 of Fig 8 as measured in the back-and-forth<br><br>
directionY. Specificslly, the base sheet 48 according to this embodiment does not exend to the front end portion 26 and therefore does not cross three first elastic members 21a. In addition, the hook par ; 17 crosses only a part of the plural second elastic members 22a. With such a hook part 17 also, gathers may not be formed even if the elastic members 20 contract. [0026]<br>
Fig. 10 is a view similar to Fig. 4, showing another preferred embodiment of the invention. Each of the side edge portions 11 in this embodiment comprises the inner sheet 4, the outer sheet 5 and the elastic members 20 intermittently bonded together by means of the hot melt adhesive 51. The base sheet 48 constituting the hook part 17 is provided separately of the inner and outer sheets 4, 5 and attached by means of bonding or welding to a supporting sheet member 61 having a size larger than the base sheet 48 and a stiffness lower than that of the base sheet 4 3, preferably, a substantially the same stiffness as that of the outer sheet 5. The sheet member 61 extends outward beyond the respective peripheral side edges 50 of the base sheet 48 in the width direction X to define peripheral regions 53, 54 having desired width dimensions m, n and further extends outward beyond the peripheral regions<br><br>
53, 54 to define regions 63, 64 along which the sheet member 61 is attached to the oater sheet 5. Such a sheet member 61 is indirectly attached 1.o the elastic members 20 and the inner sheet 4 through the outer sheet 5. [0027]<br>
Fig. 11 is a view similar to Fig. 10, wherein the elastic member 20 is in a contracted state. Of the elastic members 20 in the illustrated state, the second elastic members 22a intermittently attached to the inner and outer sheets 4, 5 contract in the width di rection X and form these inner and outer sheets 4, 5 with a plurality of gathers 66. The region 52 of the sheet member 61 in which the sheet member 61 is attached to the base sheet 48 is maintained in a flat state together with the base sheet 48 and the: peripheral regions 53, 54 are curved so as to be convex outward (downward as viewed in Fig. 11) in the vicinity of the peripheral regions 50. The peripheral regions 53, 54 curved in this manner serve to diminish a possibility ;hat the side edges 50 of the base sheet 48 might irritate the wearer's skin. When the peripheral regions 53, 54 are relatively stiff, these peripheral regions 53, 54 may slant as illustrated in Fig. 6. As will be apparent from this embodiment, if the outer sheet 5 is bonded to the inner sheet 4 and the elastic members 20, it will be preferred<br><br>
to attach the base sheet 48 of the hook part 17 indirectly to the outer sheet 5 instead of directly attaching the base sheet 48 to the outer sheet 5 By attaching the hook part 17 to the sheet member 61 in this manner, the hook part 17 can be maintained free from the elastic members 20 as well as from the inner sheet 4. [0028]<br>
Figs. 12 and 13 are views similar to Figs. 3 and 4, respectively, showing another preferred embodiment of the invention. In this emkodiment the base sheet 48 which is a part of the hook part 17 is attached to the inner surface of the flap 9 and a plurality of the hooks 29 are formed on the inner surface of the base shee" 48. The base sheet 47 of the loop part 16 extending along the side edge portion 11 of the front waist region 6 of the body cover 2 crosses the second elastic members 22a. The base sheet 47 is attached to the outer surface of the outer sheet 5 and a plurality of the loops 45 are formed as fastening elements on the outer surface of the base sheet 47. The region 52 and the peripheral regions 53, 54 of the outer sheet 5 are attached neither to the inner sheet 4 nor to the second elastic members 22a. [0029]<br>
Figs. 14 and 15 are views similar to Figs. 3 and 4,<br><br>
respectively, showing another preferred embodiment of the invention. In this embodiment the fastening means comprising the loop part 16 and the hook part 17 depicted in Figs. 3 and 4 is replaced with a fastening means comprising a target area<br>
71	and a sticky area 72 depicted in Figs. 14 and 15. In Fig.<br>
14 the flap 9 is made of a nonwoven fabric, and a plastic film<br>
73	constituting the target area 71 is unseperably attached to<br>
the inner surface of the flap 9. In Fig. 15 the sticky area<br>
72	is formed from a sticky sheet 77 comprising a base sheet<br>
74	and an adhesive agent 76 coated therewith as a fastening<br>
element and the sticky sheet 77 is unseperably attached to the<br>
outer surface of the outer sheets. The sticky area 72 is<br>
extending along the side edge portion 11 of the front waist<br>
region 6 and crosses the second elastic members 22a. The<br>
sticky area 72 can be repeatedly attached to the inner surface<br>
of the sheet 73 of the target area 71. The outer sheet 5 is<br>
attached to the inner sheet 4 and the second elastic members<br>
22a with a hot-melt adhesive 51 intermittently along the second<br>
elastic members 22a in the same manner as depicted in Fig. 4.<br>
However, the outer sheet 5 is attached neither to the inner<br>
sheet 4 nor to the second elastic members 22a in the region<br>
52 attached to the base sheet 74 and the peripheral regions<br>
53, 54 having widths m, n respectively from the peripheral side<br><br>
edges 50 of the base sheet 74. In the present invention it is possible to replace the target area 71 of Fig. 14 with the sticky area 72 and the s:icky area 72 of Fig. 15 with the target area 71. If the target area 71 is provided in the front waist region 6, the surface of the sheet 73 of the target area 71 works as the fastening element of the fastening means. [0030]<br>
Without departir.g from the scope of the invention, it is possible to shape the front waist region 6 so as to serve as the rear waist reg:.on and to shape the rear waist region 7 so as to serve as the front waist region. It is also possible to attach the loop part 16 to the outer surface of the flap 9 and to attach the hook part 17 to the inner surface of the body cover 2 without departing from the scope of the invention. In this alternative Case, the; inner sheet 4 to which the hook part 17 is attached is attached neither to the elastic members 20 nor to the outer sheet 5 in the vicinity of the hook part 17. In the present invention the rear waist region 7 may be extended from each side of the front waist region so as to be transversely larger than the front waist region 6 instead of providing the flaps 9 separately of the body cover 2. However, each extended portion of the rear waist region 7 does not have such a tendency to overlap with the front waist region 6 by<br><br>
itself as the flap 9 of Fig.. 1 shows. [0031]<br>
The present invention is applicable, not only to the disposable diaper 1, tc other articles such as a training pant, a diaper for incontinent patients, a pant for holding urine-absorbent pad and a diaper cover.<br><br>
