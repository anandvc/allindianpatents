				<td>A COMUPTER IMPLEMENTATION METHOD FOR INSTANT COMMUNICATION AND AN APPARATUS THEREFOR<br><br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates generally to a computer implementation method for instant communication and an apparatus therefor. More particularly, the invention relates to an integration of traditional e-mail with instant messaging systems in real time.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE PRIOR ART<br>
With the advent of computers, communication has never been easier. When friends and family are online, communication is much easier if invoked in realtime as it happens in instant messaging. Instarit messaging using a computer invokes a real-time communication protocol.<br>
In instant messaging using a real time communication protocol, real-time communication is possible if the screen name of users is known before one begins instant messaging. The list of screen names of users is not completely useful for communication in real-time if the user with that particular screen name is not online. This means that for real-time communication to be<br>
-1 -<br><br><br>
possible, not only should the screen name of users be known but also the users should be logged on before one begins instant messaging.<br>
The end user usually has an address, referred to as 'e-mail address', which is specific to the user for communicating electronically on a computer or similar other devices. In electronic mail, messages can be sent, received, or stored at convenient times. In conventional e-mail systems, messages are delivered in "envelopes" which are then "opened" by the recipient to be read.<br>
Conventional e-mail systems, operating across local area network boundaries, do not allow the senders of messages to determine whether their<br>
messages have been read. As a result, the sender of a message often must<br>
i telephone the recipient to verify that the needed information has not only<br>
arrived at the recipient's system, but has been reviewed by the recipient.<br>
Many proprietary e-mail systems, however, allow a sender to check a separate database to see if a message has been received. Some proprietary e-mail systems include an acknowledgement feature that allows the recipient's e-mail system to send a notification to the sender when the recipient has opened a message.<br>
In prior art e-mail systems, the sender of an e-mail message has to wait a while for a response. In addition, the sender of the message is not sure if they would get an e-mail response. When users are logged into an e-mail, instant messaging in terms of AOL Instant Messenger is possible. America Online,<br>
2<br><br>
Inc. of AOL Time Warner Inc. (AOL) pioneered the technology of instant messaging using a real time communication protocol.<br>
In AOL Instant Messenger service, for example, the user could use any number of screen names while being logged into an e-mail address and communicate with other users instantly. However, for instant communication to be possible, one has to look up manually the screen name that is actually online currently for the associated e-mail address of the other users. The problem with that is because there could be more than one screen name associated with a single e-mail address, it becomes a difficult task to accomplish instant online messaging service manually with many active screen names.<br>
In prior art systems, such as AOL's Mail Contacts Online, one has to be a member to make use of Instant Messaging service. Usually, such memberships entail a fee paid by the customer for using such services. In Mail Contacts Online service, the graphics window shows (FIG. 1) a divided window with e-mail communication window separate from the instant messaging window. The instant messaging window shows a buddy list with a list of screen names taken from the adjacent e-mail window and only those screen names that are available for instant messaging.<br>
The difficulty with prior art systems is that they are not universally available unless the user requests membership to use the e-mail and/or Instant Messaging and pays a membership fee. With the availability of e-mail access<br>
3<br><br>
WO 02/073886	PCT/USOl/07319<br>
to non-AOL members, the Instant Messaging service of prior art systems is limited in terms of number of screen names that are available in the buddy list. "Instant Messaging" is an AOL TM, so it is used herein to refer to "AOL Instant Messenger" for AOL members.<br>
Given the number of Instant Messaging type services currently available, there is a need for integrating Instant Messaging services to e-mail services such that a user with access to any e-mail service, not limited to AOL member services, can use AOL's free Instant Messaging service and, thereby, achieve communication in real-time.<br>
What is needed, therefore, is a generic service where anyone with access to an e-mail and instant messaging service can chat with anyone else instantly. The generic services should allow a graphic window with e-mail and instant messaging services to go simultaneously and smoothly so that the instant messaging is realized instantly in real time.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a computer implementation method for instant communication, comprising trie steps of: receiving in a group of e-mail addresses; making a request for a list of screen names from an instant messaging service associated with said e-mail addresses; automatically verifying screen names that are available for real-time communication; correlating said screen names to said e-mail addresses; and establishing said real-time communication by selecting an icon associated with said screen name.<br>
.4.<br><br>
The present invention also provides an apparatus for enabling instant communication between users of a computer, comprising: a means for displaying a graphic window; a means for displaying e-mail addresses between said users of said computer for the purpose of online communication; a means for displaying screen names associated with said e-mail addresses for the purpose of said instant communication; and said graphic window having said e-mail addresses and said screen names in the same window for the purpose of enabling said instant communication between said users of said computer instantly.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention provides a mechanism for the automatic integration of traditional e-mail with instant messaging services such that instant communication is provided in real-time. In one embodiment of the invention, the system has a single generic graphics window with both e-mail addresses and on-line chat addresses next to it so that anyone with access to the e-mail address could start the AOL's free instant messaging service instantly. The<br>
4A<br><br><br>
active screen names that are available for instant messaging would have an icon next to the screen name, such that instant messaging is achieved by pressing the icon as it appears next to the screen name.<br>
In the particular embodiment of the invention, the system takes in a group of e-mail addresses and makes a request for a list of screen names from the instant messaging service associated with that e-mail address. The system then automatically verifies each screen name that is available for online communication. Once a particular screen name is available for instant communication, the system correlates that screen name to that particular e-mail address. An icon appears next to the screen name that is available for online instant messaging. Instant messaging is accomplished by pressing the icon as it appears next to the active screen name.<br>
In one embodiment, the system sets up a list of screen names for tracking their online presence into a buddy list. In yet another embodiment, the system is associated with a user interface (Ul) that prevents others from knowing the person's screen name. In yet another embodiment, the system allows a manual search when the screen name is not currently used but still associated with the same e-mail addresses.<br>
Next, the system enquires of the user associated with that particular screen name for online communication. The recipient can choose to communicate with the user by clicking the icon associated with the screen name that is<br>
5<br><br>
WO 02/073886	PCT/USO1/07319<br>
currently available for instant communication. Thus, the system establishes instant messaging in real time.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
In commercially available electronic mail systems today, senders are able to send messages over a variety of networks such as local area networks, wide area networks, Internet, wireless networks, and the like. This does not, however, mean senders of the message would get an e-mail response instantly.<br>
When users are togged into an electronic mail or e-mail, instant messaging is possible if the recipient's screen name and e-mail address are known. Because users could use any number of screen names while being logged into an e-mail, this communication is, however, not instant communication in real-time. More often than not, it takes manually for a user to retrieve the screen name that is associated with that e-mail address and that is currently being used for on-line communication.<br>
This invention (FIG. 1A) provides a system for automatic integration 1000 of traditional e-mail with instant messaging service, more particularly, AOL's free Instant Messaging service for the purpose of providing communication in realtime. The invention comprises a system that takes in a group of e-mail<br>
7<br><br><br>
addresses and makes a request for a list of screen names associated with that e-mail address from the instant messaging service. The system is associated with a user interface (Ul) that protects the user's screen name if the user is not interested in on-line communication (represented in FIG. 1A as OFF) and prefers to not make his screen name available to recipients of his messages. When the user screen name is not available to the system, the system makes a manual search 200 for the screen names that are associated with that e-mail address. The problem with a manual search 200 using only knowledge of available e-mail addresses is that when a user manually does a search for screen names, there is no contextual information to indicate if the person is actually online or which screen name is being used. Because this becomes tedious, an invitation 300 is sent to the user for participation in online communica,tion and a request for screen name applicable and used with that e-mail address.<br>
Often the user is interested in on-line communication and would not mind if the screen names were available for on-line messaging. This is shown symbolically as an 'ON' state on user interface (Ul) in FIG. 1A and the invention allows for automatic search 100. The system then automatically 100 verifies each screen name that is available for online communication. Once a particular screen name is available, the system then correlates that screen name to that particular e-mail address. In one embodiment, the system periodically tracks a list of screen names for tracking their online presence and puts them into a buddy list 400.<br>
8<br><br><br>
An online real-time communication is established once the icon 500 is activated next to the screen name for instant messaging. The recipient can choose to communicate to the user by clicking on the icon associated with the screen name where the user is currently available for instant communication. Thus, the invention establishes instant messaging in real time.<br>
FIG. 2 is a flow chart showing a mechanism for enabling instant communication using an automatic 100 (FIG.1A) real-time communication via e-mail. When the user interface is enabled 10 (or is ON as in FIG.1A), the method involves taking in a group of e-mail addresses 20 and making a request for a list of screen names from an instant messaging service associated with that e-mail addresses 30. An automatic verification of screen names available for real-time communication 50 is performed for each individual screen name. If there is a screen name available for instant messaging, the system correlates the screen names available for that particular e-mail address 60 and establishes real-time communication 70 by pressing an icon 500 (FIG. 1 A) with that particular screen name. If there is no screen name available for instant messaging, the system cannot correlate the screen name with that particular e-mail address and simply continues the search for the next available screen name 40 for real-time messaging. When real-time communication is established using the described automatic search 50, the system is said to have accomplished it's task and comes to a stop 80.<br>
FIG. 3 is a flow chart showing a mechanism for enabling real-time communication using a manual 200 (FIG.1A) search for the screen name.<br>
9<br><br><br>
When the user interface is not enabled 110 (or is OFF as in FIG.1A), the method involves taking in a group of e-mail addresses 120 and making a list of screen names by manually looking for screen names 130 associated with that e-mail address and establishing instant messaging 140 if screen name is available. When real-time communication is established using the described manual search 130, the system then associates an icon (refer to 500 in FtG. 1A) 150 with the screen name that is available for instant messaging. The system is said to have accomplished its task and comes to a stop 150.<br>
FIG. 4 is a flow chart showing another embodiment of the invention, which comprises, inviting the user for instant communication and requesting the user for screen name for real-time communication when the user interface (Ul) is not enabled 210 (OFF in FIG.1 A). This embodiment is useful in prompting the user for real-time communication when the user does not wish to disclose his screen name to all individuals on the internet. The system takes in select group of e-mail addresses 220, manually tests for screen names available for instant messaging 230. If screen name is available 240 for instant messaging, the icon 500 (FIG, 1 A) is pressed and instant messaging is established.<br>
If the screen name is not available for instant messaging, then the system   ¦ invites the user for instant communication 250 by sending an electronic mail or e-mail. If the invitation is accepted 270, then the system obtains the user's screen name 280, and establishes a real-time communication 290 when the icon 500 (FIG. 1A) is pressed. The system function is completed as real-time<br>
10<br><br><br>
communication is established and comes to a stop 300 or if the invitation is not accepted 260.<br>
FIG. 5 is a flow chart showing another embodiment of the invention, which comprises enabling a list of screen names into a list, referred to as buddy list for instant messaging any time. In this embodiment, the system sets up a list of screen names for tracking their online presence into a buddy list. The system does an automatic look up of screen names 330 when the user interface is enabled (ON in FIG.1A) given a list of e-mail addresses 320. It then verifies if the available screen name is associated with that particular e-mail address and available for real-time communication.<br>
If it is not available 350, it looks back at it's list of screen names and goes to the next one until one is found that is available for instant messaging. If the system does find the screen name for that e-mail address available for instant messaging, it makes a buddy list of e-mail address with their associated screen names 360. The buddy list is periodically tested for online presence 370 and updated for establishing real-time communication 390 or returned 380 for the next available screen name for that e-mail address. When realtime communication is established, the icon 500 is pressed for communication with the individual whose screen name is displayed and the process ends 395 with satisfactory completion.<br>
Although the invention is described herein with reference to the preferred embodiment,  one skilled  in the art will  readily appreciate that other<br>
11<br><br><br>
