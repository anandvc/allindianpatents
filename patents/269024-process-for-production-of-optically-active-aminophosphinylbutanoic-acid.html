				<td>SPECIFICATION<br>
PROCESS FOR PRODUCTION OF OPTICALLY ACTIVE<br>
AMINOPHOSPHINYLBUTANOIC ACIDS<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a process for the production<br>
of optically active aminophosphinylbutanoic acids that are<br>
important as an intermediate of a compound useful in a herbicide<br>
such as L-2-amino-4-(hydroxymethylphosphinyl)butanoic acid<br>
(hereinafter, abbreviated as L-AHPB).<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
DL-2-amino-4-(hydroxymethylphosphinyl)butanoic acid<br>
(hereinafter, abbreviated as DL-AHPB) is a known compound having<br>
a herbicidal activity and used as an effective herbicide having<br>
a wide spectrum (Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open (JP-A)<br>
No. Sho52-139727) . However, the herbicidal activity of DL-AHPB<br>
is about a half of that of L-AHPB, and it has been clear that<br>
a main substance of the herbicidal activity is L-AHPB (JP-A No.<br>
Sho55-000025 and JP-A No. Sho59-219297). Because of this,<br>
development of a process for producing L-AHPB selectively and<br>
effectively has been strongly desired.<br>
Conventionally, as for the process for the production of<br>
L-AHPB, processes such as (a) a process with using a microorganism<br>
and an enzyme and (b) an asymmetric synthesis method are known.<br>
As for examples of the process of (a), a process for producing<br>
L-AHPB from 4-(hydroxymethylphosphinyl)-2-oxobutanoic acid by<br>
using a transamination enzyme (Japanese Patent Application<br>
National Publication (Laid-Open) No. 2003-528572) and a process<br><br>
for producing L-AHPB from N-acetyl-DL-AHPB by using an enzymatic<br>
racemate resolution (Japanese Patent Application National<br>
Publication (Laid-Open) No. 2003-505031) are disclosed.<br>
However, there are problems in both of these processes being<br>
needed to carry out a reaction at a low substrate concentration,<br>
post treatment and purification steps are complicated, an<br>
expensive optically active amino acid has to be used at an<br>
equivalent mol or more in the transamination reaction, etc.<br>
As for examples of the asymmetric synthesis of (b), a process<br>
for synthesizing L-AHPB by alkylation of<br>
(R)-3-isopropyl-2,5-dialkoxy-3,6-dihydropyrazine (JP-A No.<br>
Sho62-132891 and Tetrahedron Lett., 1255 (1987)) and a method<br>
of converting L-vinylglycine stereospecifically to L-AHPB<br>
(Tetrahedron, 8263 (1992)) are disclosed. However, it is<br>
necessary to use an expensive optically active amino acid such<br>
as D-valine and L-vinylglycine as a starting raw material, and<br>
there is a problem in the point of providing a raw material with<br>
low cost and in a large amount. Furthermore, an example of the<br>
asymmetric synthesis including a process for producing L-AHPB<br>
by an asymmetric hydrogenation reaction of<br>
2-acetylamino-4-(hydroxymethylphosphinyl)-2-butenoic acid<br>
(JP-A No. Sho62-226993 and J. Org. Chem. , 56, 1783 (1991)) is<br>
disclosed. In this process, the asymmetric hydrogenation<br>
reaction is performed using a rhodium catalyst having an<br>
optically active diphenylphosphine compound as a ligand.<br>
However, the rhodium catalyst is very expensive and catalytic<br>
efficiency is not high.<br>
On the other hand, the asymmetric hydrogenation reaction<br>
using a rhodium catalyst from dehydroamino acid to amino acid<br><br>
has already been well known in general (Chem. Rev. , 103, 3029-3070<br>
(2003)). However, many of the reactions are an asymmetric<br>
reduction reaction to dehydroamino acid having an alkyl group<br>
and an aryl group in a side chain, and there are few examples<br>
of a reaction using dehydroamino acid having a substituent with<br>
high polarity in a side chain.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
PROBLEMS TO BE SOLVED BY THE INVENTION<br>
The objective of the present invention is to provide a process<br>
for the production of an optically active<br>
aminophosphinylbutanoic acid, that is important as an<br>
intermediate of a compound that is useful in a herbicide such<br>
as L-AHPB, with good efficiency and high enantioselectivity with<br>
