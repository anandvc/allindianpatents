4-TETRAZ0LYL-4PHENYLPIPERIDINE  DERIVATIVES  FOR  TREATING   PAIN<br>
This application claims the benefit of U.S. provisional application Serial No. 60/427,381, filed November 18,2002, U.S. provisional application Serial No. 60/460,278, filed April 3,2003, and U.S. provisional application Serial No. 60/488,488 filed July 17,2003, the entire disclosure of each of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.<br>
1.        Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to 4-TetrazoIyl-4-phenylpiperidine Compounds, compositions comprising an effective amount of a 4-Tetrazolyl-4-phenylpiperidine Compound and methods for preventing or treating pain or diarrhea in an animal comprising administering to an animal in need of such treatment or prevention an effective amount of a 4-Tetrazolyl-4-phenylpiperidine Compound.<br><br>
Pain has been traditionally managed by administering a non-opioid analgesic, such as acetylsalicylic acid, choline magnesium trisalicylate, acetaminophen, ibuprofen, fenoprofen, diflusinal and naproxen; or an opioid analgesic, such as morphine, hydromorphone, methadone, levorphanol, fentanyl, oxycodone and oxymorphone. Id.<br>
United States Patent No. 6,576,650 B1, United States Patent 6,166,039, and United States Patent No. 5,849,761, to Yaksh and United States Patent No. 6,573,282, to Yaksh et al. describe 1,4 substituted piperidine derivatives allegedly useful as peripherally active anti hyperalgesic opiates.<br>
United States Patent No. 6,362,203 Bl to Mogi et al. describes 4 hydroxy-4-phenylpiperidine derivatives that are alleged to exhibit peripheral analgesic action.<br>
Canadian Patent Publication No. 949560 of Carron et al. describes piperidine derivatives bearing substituents at the 1 and 4 positions that are alleged to be useful as analgesics.<br><br>
International Publication No. WO 02/38185 A2 of Dunn et al. describes 1,4-substituted piperidine compounds that are allegedly useful as an antihyperalgesic opiate.<br>
The Abstract of International Publication No. WO 01/70689 Al also discloses piperidine derivatives carrying substituents at the 1 and 4 positions that are allegedly useful as opioid o receptor agonists.<br>
Traditional opioid analgesics exert their pharmacological activity once they have passed through the blood-brain barrier. But this blood-brain barrier passage can lead to undesirable central nervous system-mediated side effects, such as respiratory depression, increased drug tolerance, increased drug dependence, constipation and unwanted euphoria.<br>
There remains a clear need for new drugs that are useful for treating or preventing pain or diarrhea and that reduce or avoid one or more side effects associated with traditional therapy for treating pain or diarrhea.<br>

4.4.1    Therapeutic/Prophylactic Administration and Compositions of the Invention<br>
Due to their activity, the 4-Tetrazolyl-4-phenylpiperidine Compounds are advantageously useful in veterinary and human medicine. As described above, the 4-Tetrazolyl-4-phenylpiperidine Compounds are useful for treating or preventing pain or diarrhea in an animal in need thereof.<br>
When administered to an animal, the 4-Tetrazolyl-4-phenylpiperidine<br>
Compounds can be administered as a component of a pharmaceutical composition that<br>
comprises a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient The present compositions,<br>
which comprise a 4-Tetrazolyl-4-phenylpiperidine Compound, are in one embodiment<br>
administered orally. The compositions of the invention can also be administered by any  <br><br><br>
other convenient route, for example, <br>
by infusion or bolus injection, by absorption through  <br><br>
epithelial or mucocutaneous linings (e.g., oral mucosa, rectal, and intestinal mucosa, etc.)<br>
and can be administered together with another therapeutic agent. Administration can be<br>
systemic or local. Various delivery systems are known, e.g., encapsulation in liposomes,<br>
microparticles, microcapsules, capsules, etc., and can be used to administer the<br>
4-Tetrazolyl-4 phenylpiperidine Compounds.<br>
Methods of administration include but are not limited to intradermal, intramuscular, intraperitoneal, intravenous, subcutaneous, intranasal, epidural, oral, sublingual, intracerebral, intravaginal, transdermal, rectal, by inhalation, or topical, particularly to the ears, nose, eyes, or skin. The mode of administration is left to the discretion of the practitioner. In most instances, administration will result in the release of the 4-Tetrazolyl-4-phenylpiperidine Compounds into the bloodstream.<br>
In specific embodiments, it may be desirable to administer the 4-Tetrazolyl-4-phenylpiperidine Compounds locally. This may be achieved, for example, and not by way of limitation, by local infusion during surgery, topical application, e.g., in conjunction with a wound dressing after surgery, by injection, by means of a catheter, by means of a suppository, or by means of an implant, said implant being of a porous, non porous, or gelatinous material, including membranes, such as sialastic membranes, or <br><br>

4-Tetrazolyl-4-phenylpiperidine Compound to cure or control the condition in a minimum amount of time. Advantages of controlled release compositions include extended activity of the drug, reduced dosage frequency, and increased patient compliance. In addition, controlled release compositions can favorably affect the time of onset of action or other<br>
25     characteristics, such as blood levels of the 4-Tetrazolyl-4-phenylpiperidine Compound, and can thus reduce the occurrence of side (eg., adverse) effects.<br>
In one embodiment, controlled release compositions can initially release an amount of a 4-Tetrazolyl-4-phenylpiperidine Compound that promptly treats or prevents pain or diarrhea, and gradually and continually release other amounts of the<br>
30     4-Tetrazolyl-4-phenylpiperidine Compound to maintain this level of therapeutic or<br>
prophylactic effect over an extended period of time. To maintain this constant level of the 4-Tetrazolyl-4-phenylpiperidine Compound in the body, the<br>
4-Tetrazolyl-4-phenylpiperidine Compound can be released from the dosage form at a rate that will replace the amount of 4-Tetrazolyl-4-phenylpiperidine Compound being<br><br>
WO 2004/046132	PCT/US2003/036742<br>
metabolized and excreted from the body. Controlled release of an active ingredient can be<br>
stimulated by various conditions including, but not limited to, changes in pH, changes in<br>
temperature, concentration or availability of enzymes, concentration or availability of water,<br>
or other physiological conditions or compounds.<br>
5	The amount of the 4-Tetrazolyl-4-phenylpiperidine Compounds that is<br>
effective in the treatment or prevention of pain or diarrhea can depend on the nature or severity of the disorder or condition causing the pain and can be determined by standard clinical techniques. In addition, in vitro or in vivo assays can optionally be employed to help identify optimal effective dosage amounts. The precise dose to be employed can also 10     depend on the intended route of administration, and the degree or severity of the pain or diarrhea and should be decided according to the judgment of the practitioner and each patient's circumstances in view of published clinical studies.
