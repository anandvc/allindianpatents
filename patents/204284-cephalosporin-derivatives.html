E.g., mice are infected with an ED 95% of Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC<br>
4995), Streprococcus pyogenes (ATCC 29218), Escherichia coli (A 12 NFI culture collection) and<br>
are treated 1, 5 and 24 hours after infection. The ED 50% values ranging from ca. 0.2 to 50 mg/kg body weight are calculated by Probit analysis of the administered dosages of compounds.<br><br>
Activity is determined by numbers of surviving animals per group of 8 mice per dosage until day<br>
5 after infection.<br>
The active compounds of the invention show an surprising overall activity spectrum.<br>
It has, for example, been determined that the MHK (pg/ml) of the compound of Example<br>

(MSSA) is of ca. 
6.4; against multi-drug resistant Pneumococcus is of 0.4.<br>

e.g. bacterial diseases.<br>
For this indication, the appropriate dosage will, of course, vary depending upon, for<br>
example, the compound of formula I employed, the host, the mode of administration and<br>
the nature and severity of the conditions being treated. However, in general, for<br>
satisfactory results in larger mammals, for example humans, an indicated daily dosage is in<br>
the range from about 0.05 to 5 g, for example 0.1 to about 2.5 g, of an active compound<br>
of the invention conveniently administered, for example, in divided doses up to four times<br>
a day.	!<br>

For example, they are used as a constituent of capsules, or injection or instillation preparations, which contain a quantity of active compounds that is sufficient to attain an optimum blood level, that is, ca. 10 to 500 mg per capsule. For this application, the dosage to be administered depends on the compound used and the type of administration, as well as the type of treatment. With larger mammals, satisfactory results may be obtained when administering a daily dose of ca. 0.5 to 6 g. If required, this amount may be givdh in correspondingly smaller doses two to four times daily, or in sustained release form.<br>
