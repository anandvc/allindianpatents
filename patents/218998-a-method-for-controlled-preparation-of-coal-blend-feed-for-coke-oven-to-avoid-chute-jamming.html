oven such as to avoid problems of chute jamming due to excessive moisture content in feed<br>
coal and a system for addition of oil-water emulsion through multiple spray nozzles on coal<br>
blend for coke oven.<br>
Prior Art and the drawbacks:<br>
In selective crushing units of a running Steel Plant, coal is fed from silos to primary crusher<br>
units through two numbers of conveyors. The system was designed for maximum moisture<br>
level of 8.5% in feed coal. During monsoon, the moisture level in coal increases beyond<br>
8.5%, leading to problems such as jamming of chutes and classifiers. Due to jamming,<br>
sometimes the classifiers are bypassed in order to supply coal to service bunkers<br>
continuously. This causes deterioration of coal crushing and in turn coke quality.<br>
The performance of the selected crushing unit deteriorated especially during monsoon<br>
period, because of poor fluidization of coal due to high moisture content in feed coal.<br>

It is therefore an object of this invention to propose a method and system for system for<br>
controlled preparation of coal blend feed for coke oven such as to avoid problems of chute<br>
jamming by way of selective addition of oil-water emulsion to coal for improving the<br>
performance of coal feed supply.<br>
It is another object of the invention to propose a method and system for system for<br>
controlled preparation of coal blend feed for coke oven which will overcome the problem of<br>
chute jamming prevalent in the known systems; the jamming is primarily due to high<br>
moisture content above designed value in coal feed during monsoon period.<br>

Detailed Description of the Invention:<br>
The following details were studied and achieved in realizing the objects of the invention.<br>
Addition of oil-water emulsion to moist coal charge not only increased the bulk density of coal but<br>
also improved the handling and the flow properties of the coal charge. This helped in producing<br>
coke of uniform and improved quality and resulted in higher throughput of the ovens.<br>
Spraying oil-water emulsion on coal blend improves the flow-ability of coal by reducing its angle<br>
of repose.<br>
A novel system for oil-water emulsion spraying over coal blend was also designed for the first<br>
time in the industry.<br>
The following improvements were observed:<br>
a. Different types of oils, like light tar oil, fuel oil, light diesel oil, de-phenolated oil, heavy diesel<br>
oil etc. had been experimented by spraying on coal charge to accrue the full benefits of oil-<br>
water emulsion addition on coal.<br>
b. From various experiments conducted, it has been observed that the highest densities of coal<br>
were achieved with least viscous oil.<br>
c. Increase in bulk density of coal charge as a result of oil-water emulsion addition was greatly<br>
influenced by the moisture content of the coal charge.<br>
d. A change in the moisture content brought change in the bulk density and also in the<br>
carbonization time.<br>
Experimental Verification:<br>
tn the preferred embodiment, heavy diesel oil and water emulsion was tried.<br>
Heavy diesel oil and water mixture in the ratio of 1.5 to 1.6 parts was sprayed on the coal blend.<br>
The oil addition to the coal blend was around 0.02-0.03% by weight of the charge coal. The<br>
system performed successfully during trials.<br>
The process parameters in designing the oil-water emulsion spraying system were based on the<br>
considerations mentioned in Table 1.<br>
Table 1: Process parameter considered in designing a most preferred oil-water emulsion<br>
spraying system:<br>
Brief Description of the Accompanying Drawings:<br>
The invention will now be more fully described with reference to the accompanying drawings<br>
wherein, Figure 1 exhibits the schematic arrangement of the oil-water emulsion spraying system.<br>
The system (1) consisted of a 9 m3 water tank (2) installed at ground level. The tapping of water<br>
has been taken from nearby main water supply line (3) (not shown) through a manually operated<br>
gate valve (4) (not shown).<br>
A mild steel fabricated oil storage tank (5) of 6 m3 was installed below the ground level with due<br>
care of fire safety norms. Oil from oil tanker (6) (not shown) was filled in the underground oil<br>
tank (5) by gravity flow. The outlet (7) of the water tank (2) and the out let (8) of the oil tank (5)<br>
were connected to a common mild steel fabricated mixing tank (9) of 1 m3 capacity. The mixing<br>
tank was installed inside a shed.<br>
Water was pumped into the mixing tank by means of a pump (10), preferably of 2.6 m3/hr<br>
capacity. The flow rate of water was controlled manually by means of a globe valve (11), installed<br>
in the return line (12). Suitable manually operated isolation valves (13) were installed on both<br>
sides of the water pump.<br>
Similarly, oil from oil storage tank (5) was pumped into the mixing tank (9) by means of a<br>
pump (14) of 1.4 m3/hr capacity. Oil flow rate was controlled manually by means of a globe<br>
valve (15) installed in the return line (12).<br>
Suitable strainers (16) were provided in both oil and water lines before the pumps, to filter foreign<br>
materials. Motors of both oil and emulsion pump selected were of flameproof quality in order to<br>
avoid any eventual fire hazards. All safety norms had been considered in designing the system.<br>
The flow rates of oil, water and emulsion were measured by rotameters (17) installed in the<br>
respective lines. The oil and water were mixed in the mixing tank by counter flow principle. The<br>
mixing was further intensified by a re-circulation pump (18). The mixing tank was provided with<br>
three level sensors (19a, 19b, 19c) for low, intermediate and high level. The low level sensor<br>
indicated the initial quantity of oil filled in the mixing tank. After reaching this level, the oil pump<br>
was switched off. The water pump was switched on and the tank was filled with water pumped by<br>
water pump from the water tank. The water pump was then switched off when the level reached<br>
the high limit. After reaching the high limit, the re-circulation pump (18) was started and the<br>
uniform mixture of oil-water was formed.<br>
Once the level of emulsion reached the high level in the mixing tank, the sensor gave audio and<br>
visual signals in the control room. The high level signal indicated that the system was ready for<br>
operation.<br>
Subsequently, the operator could switch-on the emulsion pump (19) to supply the emulsion<br>
mixture from the mixing tank to the spray points over the feed coal. The capacity of emulsion<br>
pump was preferably designed as 4 m3/hr. The operation of the system was started with the<br>
switching on the button in the control panel. When the level of emulsion reached intermediate<br>
level sensor, the water and oil pumps were started simultaneously to feed the mixing tank at<br>
predetermined/set rates.<br>
Four different locations A, B, C and D were selected where oil-water emulsion was sprayed over<br>
the coal charge. These were the transfer chutes from conveyor belts to primary crusher and the<br>
transfer chutes from secondary crusher to a pneumatic classifier The supply of emulsion to the<br>
spray points was carried out through suitably designed pipe lines and spray nozzles A1, B1, C1<br>
and D1. The flow rate of oil-water emulsion was controlled by a manual globe valve 20a, 20b, 20c<br>
and 20d installed in the line. There was also a provision to control the flow rate of emulsion at<br>
individual spray points by means of globe valves installed in the lines.<br>
Trials were conducted with different proportions of oil and water mixtures in the emulsions. The<br>
proportion of oil and water was varied in the mixtures to observe the effects on the operational<br>
parameters. High speed diesel oil and water were varied in the ratio of 1:5 to 1:6 in the emulsion<br>
mixture, so that the oil addition to the coal blend was around 0.02 to 0.03% of the coal charge.<br>
The comparative performance observed in the experiments carried on the existing coke ovens in<br>
a steel plant during the monsoon periods of 1999-2000 (before introduction of oil-water emulsion<br>
spray system) and 2000-2001 (after the introduction of oil-water emulsion spray system) are<br>
shown below in Table 2.<br>
Table 2: Comparison of coal/coke quality parameter before and after installation of oil-<br>
water emulsion spraying system in an experimental verification.<br>
Techno-Economic Benefits:<br>
• Oil addition has resulted in improved performance of selective crushing unit at the experiment<br>
carried out in an existing Steel Plant.<br>
• Coke quality (M 10) has improved to average 7.9 during July, August and September, 2000<br>
compared to 9.0 during same period before installation of the system.<br>
• There is no deterioration in crushing level of coal blend during monsoon periods.<br>
• The crushing index (-3.2 mm) in July, August and September, 2000 were improved to 85.8%,<br>
86.7%, 86% as against 82.5%, 83.8% and 85.74% during July, August and September, 1999<br>
respectively.<br>
• Flow ability of coal has improved resulting in less jamming of chutes in coal handling plant.<br>
• There was no by-passing of classifiers during monsoon period compared to approx. 33 shifts<br>
by-passing during the same period before installation of the system.<br>
• There was no pushing droppage due to coal flow problems during the monsoon period<br>
compared to approximately 100 pushing droppage during the same period before installation<br>
of the system.<br>

feeding an initial quantity of water depending upon the water content by measuring<br>
and controlling the flow rate and passing through strainers to remove any foreign<br>
particles; pre-mixing of the oil and water emulsion thus obtained takes place in said<br>
mixing tank by counter-flow principle. A recirculation pump subjects the pre-mixed<br>
water and oil emulsion to intense mixing. An emulsion pump operatively supply the<br>
emulsion mixture from said mixing tank to the spray points over the coal blend feed.</td>
