				<td>A METHOD OF CONTINUOUS CRYSTALLINE<br>
RIBBON GROWTH AND SYSTEM THEREFOR<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The invention relates generally to crystal growth of semiconductor materials, and more<br>
specifically to continuous crystal growth of silicon sheet for use as solar cell substrate material.<br>
Background<br>
To produce lower cost solar cells to facilitate large scale electrical applications of solar<br>
electricity, it is important to provide lowercost substrate materials for making the solar cells. A<br>
known method for achieving this objective is to grow a crystalline silicon using a continuous<br>
ribbon growth process as described in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,661,200; 4,627,887; 4,689,109; and<br>
4,594,229.<br>
According to the continuous ribbon growth method, two high temperature material strings<br>
are introduced through holes in a crucible which contains a shallow layer of molten silicon. A<br>
crystalline silicon ribbon forms as the melt solidifies while being pulled vertically from the melt.<br>
The strings stabilize the position of edges of the growing ribbon. The molten silicon freezes into<br>
a solid ribbon just above the layer of molten silicon. To make this ribbon silicon process<br>
continuous, more silicon is added to the melt as the crystalline silicon is formed to keep the<br>
amount of melt constant. Keeping the amount of the melt constant during the growth process is<br>
important in order to achieve uniform and controllable growth of the crystalline silicon. It is also<br>
important to keep the thermal environment of the cooling ribbon constant. Slight changes in the<br>
depth of the melt and consequent changes in the vertical position of the solid-liquid interface can<br>
significantly change this thermal environment. For example, it has been found that variations in<br>
the melt depth of more than about one millimeter can result in a markedly different thickness and<br>
introduce a residual stress state of the grown silicon ribbon. For all of these reasons, a constant<br>
melt level is an important element in insuring uniform, controlled growth of silicon ribbon.<br>
One way to control the depth of the melt is to continuously measure the depth of the melt<br>
and to control the rate at which silicon is added to the melt based on the measured depth. The<br>
depth of the melt must be measured in a way that is simple, cost effective, accurate, non-<br>
contaminating, and capable of being connected in a feedback loop to the feeder.<br>
Several methods for measuring the melt depth are known. For example, one method uses<br>
an oscillating probe consisting of a thin graphite rod, with the making or breaking of electrical<br>
continuity as the probe touches the molten silicon giving the vertical position of the melt surface.<br>
This requires an actuator mechanism, a position sensor, and a clear vertical access to the melt.<br>
This method, however, presents a problem because one implementation of the growth technique<br>
relies on precisely positioned insulating shields to shape the cooling profile of the ribbon.<br>
Allowing room for a mechanical linkage is an undesirable constraint in the design and placement<br>
of these insulating shields.<br>
Another known method utilizes a laser beam which is reflected from the melt surface.<br>
This technique is used in metal foundry work for melt depth measurement. The problem with<br>
this method, however, is that providing a clear optical path to the melt surface hampers the<br>
design of insulating components. In addition, it is difficult to maintain clean viewing ports in an<br>
environment where vapor deposited silicon oxide is common.<br>
A third method is more indirect and involves measuring the weight and size of the grown<br>
crystal to track the loss of silicon from the crucible. This technique is described in U.S. Patent<br>
No. 4,936,947. A major disadvantage of this method, aside from its complexity, is that it is<br>
applicable for growth of discrete crystals in a batch mode and is less applicable for continuous<br>
growth.<br>
The above described methods are inadequate in satisfying the necessary criteria for<br>
making cost-effective solar cell substrate material. It is therefore an object of the present<br>
invention to provide a method which does satisfy these criteria.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
The present invention features an apparatus and method for providing improved precision<br>
in the measurement and regulation of the depth of the molten semiconductor pool (the "melt") in<br>
a continuous crystal growth process.<br>
In one aspect, the invention features a method of continuous crystal growth, A crucible<br>
comprising a melt of a source material is provided, and an additional source material is<br>
continuously fed into the melt. To measure the depth, an input signal is passed through the<br>
crucible and the melt, and an output signal generated in response to the input signal is measured.<br>
The output signal delates to a depth of the melt. The depth of the melt is maintained at a<br>
substantially constant level by adjusting the rate of feeding the additional source material using<br>
the output signal. A crystalline ribbon is continuously grown by solidifying the melt at the solid-<br>
liquid interface. The source material can comprise a semiconductor material.<br>
In one embodiment, to measure the depth of the melt, a current is passed through the<br>
crucible and the melt via a first pair of leads connected to the crucible, and a voltage generated in<br>

output signal generated in response to the input signal is measured. The output signal is related<br>
to the depth of the melt. An amount of a source material introduced into the melt is adjusted to<br>
maintain the depth at a substantially constant level using the output signal.<br>
In one embodiment, to control the depth of the melt, a current is applied via a first pair of<br>
leads connected to the crucible, and a responsive voltage is measured via a second pair of leads<br>
positioned between the first pair of leads and connected to the crucible.<br>

growth. An input signal is applied through a crucible and the melt disposed within the crucible,<br>

system includes a crucible comprising a melt of a source material, a power source electrically<br>
connected to the crucible through a first pair of leads, a feedback controller electrically connected<br>

source material into the melt in response to the feedback controller. The source material can<br>
comprise a semiconductor material.<br>
In one embodiment, the first pair of leads applies an input signal to the crucible and the<br>
melt, and the second pair of leads measures an output signal generated in response to the input<br>
signal. The input signal can comprise a current and the output signal can comprise a voltage.<br>
In one detailed embodiment, the first pair and the second pair of leads are co-linear and<br>
attached to a bottom surface of the crucible. In another embodiment, the fust pair of leads can be<br>
disposed on adjacent corners of the crucible and the second pair of the leads can be disposed on<br>
adjacent corners of the crucible.<br>

Detailed Description<br>
Referring to Figures 1 and 2, a continuous ribbon growth system 10 includes a crucible<br>
12 containing a pool of molten silicon ("the melt") 14 and a pair of strings 16 extending through<br>
the crucible 12. A thin polycrystalline sheet of silicon 18 is slowly drawn from the melt 14 as the<br>
cooler liquid silicon crystallizes at the top of meniscus 19. The strings 16 passing through holes<br>
(not shown) in the bottom of the crucible 12 become incorporated in and define the edge<br>
boundaries of the crystalline sheet 18. The strings 16 stabilize the edges as the sheet 18 grows.<br>
The surface tension of the silicon prevents leaks through the holes of the crucible 12 where the<br>
strings 16 pass through. In the continuous-ribbon growth system 10, the melt 14 and the crucible<br>
12 are housed within an inert-gas filled housing (not shown) to prevent oxidation of the molten<br>
silicon. Rollers (not shown) keep the sheet 18 moving vertically as the sheet 18 grows. The<br>
crucible 12 remains heated to keep the silicon molten in the melt 14.<br>
The depth of the melt 14 is measured, and this information is provided to the feeder 26 to<br>
adjust The rats of introducing silicon into the melt 14 to keep the melt depth constant during the<br>
crystal growth. The feeder 26 adds silicon pellets to the melt 14 to compensate for the silicon<br>
lost from the melt 14 as the crystalline sheet 18 grows from the melt 14. The depth of the melt<br>
14 is measured by passing an input signal through the crucible 12 and the melt 14, and by<br>
measuring an output signal generated in response to the input signal. The output signal indicates<br>
the depth of the melt.<br>
In one embodiment, a current IIN is applied to the combination of the crucible 12 and the<br>
melt 14 through a pair of electrodes A and B, and a resultant potential is measured. The resultant<br>
potential VOUT is measured by a differential amplifier 22 through a pair of electrodes C and D,<br>
and provides a bulk resistance signal. The resultant potential is fed into the feedback circuitry<br>
24, which generates a control signal for controlling the feed rate of the feeder 26. The feedback<br>
circuitry 24 is set up to maintain the resultant voltage at a constant level which corresponds to a<br>
desired melt height. In one embodiment, the pair of electrodes C and D are positioned between<br>
the pair of electrodes A and B.<br>
The relationship between the melt depth and the measured output signal responsive to an<br>
input signal is described as follows. The present method of depth measurement utilizes unique<br>
properties of semiconductors and a commonly used crucible material (e.g., graphite). For<br>
example, at room temperature silicon is normally a semiconductor. However, at its melting<br>
point, like other semiconductors, silicon becomes a conductor of electricity almost as conductive<br>
as a metal. Graphite is also a conductor of electricity, although conductivity of the molten silicon<br>
is greater than that of graphite and therefore dominates when measured in parallel.<br>
The conductivity of the silicon melt is directly proportional to the cross-sectional area of<br>
the silicon melt. A change in the molten silicon melt depth changes the cross-sectional area of<br>
the silicon melt and consequently its conductivity, and conversely its resistance. When an<br>
electrical current is passed through both the crucible 12 and the melt 14, by making an electrical<br>
connection to two points (i.e., electrodes A and B) on the crucible 12, the melt 14 and the<br>
crucible 12 wall form a parallel resistive path. Thus, the electric potential developed in response<br>
to the applied current is affected by the depth of the melt 14 in the crucible 12. A voltage<br>
measurement taken across two points (i.e., electrodes C and D) on the crucible 12 provides a<br>
signal which is representative of the combined resistivity of the melt 14 and the graphite crucible<br>
12, and thus represents the height (or depth) of the melt 14 in the crucible 12. The bulk<br>
resistivity of a typical graphite material used for the construction of semiconductor processing<br>
crucibles is about one milliohrn-centimeter. The bulk resistivity of molten silicon is in the order<br>
of twenty (20) times less. Thus, if the area of the crucible section is significantly less than 20<br>
times the area of the section of the typical melt (which is a typical case), then the molten silicon<br>
can be considered to be a "shorting layer" on top of a resistive layer of graphite. The measure<br>
then would preferably consider the resistance of the melt since the melt dominates the overall<br>
electrical conductance. Figure 3 illustrates a circuit diagram of the continuous ribbon growth<br>
system 10 of Figures 1 and 2.<br>
Referring to Figure 4, the continuous ribbon growth system 10' includes a crucible 12'<br>
containing a melt 14'. This figure shows another embodiment whereby the crucible 12' is<br>
constructed of an insulating material such as graphite, quartz, silicon carbide, or silicon nitride.<br>
In this embodiment, the depth of the melt 14' is measured by passing an input signal through the<br>
pair of electrodes A and B in direct contact with the melt 14' and by measuring a resulting output<br>
signal through the pair of electrodes C and D also in contact with the melt 14'. In one<br>
embodiment, the input signal is current and the output signal is voltage.<br>
As shown in Figure 5, the relationship between the measured output signal (i.e., voltage)<br>
and the depth of the melt 14 is not necessarily linear for the system of Figures 1-3. However, for<br>
small deviations from the operating point (of about .12 inches), a linear fit is adequate for control<br>
purposes, since the usual operating range is on a substantially linear portion of this curve. The<br>
nature of the non-linearity is dependent on the geometry, the conductivity of the graphite material<br>
of the crucible 12, and the positioning of the electrodes A, B on the crucible 12. In the<br>
embodiment of Figure 4, where the crucible 12' is formed of an insulating material (e.g., quartz)<br>
and contact is made directly to the melt 14', the response signal would be linear. The non-<br>
linearity in the system of Figures 1-3 can, however, be accommodated and described by a simple<br>
equation which can be embedded in the software of a Programmable Logic Controller (PLC). A<br>
plot of the actual melt depth versus voltage output, as well as a simple equation (i.e., C1(volts)-1-5<br>
- C2) that adequately describes the data is shown in Figure 6. C1 and C2 are unique for a given<br>
configuration of probe spacing and operating point. In one embodiment, a representative value<br>
of C1 is 0.068 and C2 is determined in uss. The use of this software is only needed when it is<br>
necessary to recover the melt depth from very large deviations from the nominal operating point.<br>
Because the system is designed to maintain the measured voltage at a predetermined value,<br>
however, the non-linearity is of little importance in most of the practical situations. Thus, the<br>
spatial-to-electrical transfer function may be approximated as linear around the operating point<br>
for purposes of designing speed and stability of the feedback loop.<br>
Referring to Figure 7, the electrodes A and B apply a current to the crucible 12 and the<br>
electrodes C and D measure the voltage generated in response to the applied current. As shown,<br>
electrode A is connected to a current source 50, and electrode B is connected to a DC power<br>
supply 52. The power supply 52 and the current source 50 are also electrically connected to each<br>
other, and together apply current to the crucible 12. The current source 50 limits current flow to<br>
the crucible 12 to a valve (e.g., less than 2 Amps). Current is sensed by a 56 m? sensing<br>
resistor, the voltage drop across it is input to a differential amplifier. Voltage output from the<br>
amplifier is compared to a reference voltage. The voltage output goes to a push-pull transistor<br>
pair which controls the gate of the power FET and serves to control current through the FET.<br>
The output signals generated in response to the input signals are sensed by sensing probes C and<br>
D, and are transmitted to an amplifier of a two-stage signal amplification circuitry 54. The<br>
responsive output signal is in the 1 µV range. The output signal is filtered and amplified to<br>
produce an output signal of about 1 V.<br>
In one embodiment, the resistance measurement of the crucible silicon melt combination<br>
is made in a four-wire fashion, where the current is passed through the crucible/silicon melt<br>
combination by connecting to a first pair of contact points A, B on the crucible 12, and the<br>
voltage is measured at a second pair of contact points C, D on the crucible 12 as shown in<br>
Figures 1 and 2. When the resistance measurement is made in a four-wire fashion, the spatiai<br>
placement of the four contacts relative to each other is not critical, so contacts may be placed<br>
according to mechanical or thermal convenience. For instance, the four contacts could be co-<br>
linear along the bottom of the crucible, or they could be arranged as in a Van der Pauw type<br>
resistivity measurement, where the current is impressed across two adjacent comers of the<br>
crucible, and the voltage is measured across the other two adjacent corners. When practical, it is<br>
desirable to arrange the contacts spatially to provide the highest signal-to-noise ratio in making<br>
the relevant measurements. Absolute signal level and sensitivity of signal level to change in melt<br>
height are important.<br>
Initial implementations of the invention using mechanically convenient, non-ideal (from a<br>
signal-to-noise ratio standpoint) placement of the electrodes allowed an adequate signal-to-noise<br>
ratio to regulate the melt height to within plus or minus 2.5 mils, using an input current of 2<br>
Amps.<br>
One embodiment of the invention uses a pulsed DC measurement to eliminate the effects<br>
of DC offset drift on the measurement. Another embodiment utilizes modulation of the current<br>
and synchronous detection of the voltage signal, at a frequency selected to avoid harmonics of 60<br>
Hz. Another embodiment utilizes a modulated current and a narrow bandpass filter to monitor<br>
the voltage signal. The effects of temperature variation on the resistance measured can be<br>
compensated for if the temperature of the melt and crucible are monitored. Separate tight<br>
regulation of the temperature of the melt and crucible are needed for the growth process and<br>
make compensating the resistance measurement unnecessary.<br>
The depth of the melt measured according to the present invention is used to control the<br>
rate of feeding the silicon source material into the crucible, and thereby maintains the depth of<br>
the melt at a constant to achieve controlled uniform crystal growth. Referring to Figure 8, the<br>
feeder power which controls the rate of introducing the source material responds to the melt<br>
depth measurement over time.<br>
