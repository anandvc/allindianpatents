FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a system to control carbonization of coke by predicting ready<br>
oven temperature of coke oven during coking process.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Coking is the process of heating coal in coke ovens to drive volatile matter from it.<br>
Ovens are generally heated by coke-oven gas, which burns in heating flues in an<br>
ovens side walls. Waste gases from this combustion pass out through a stack or<br>
chimney. At around 20 minute intervals, the flows of gas, air are reversed to maintain<br>
uniform temperature distribution across the wall. The design of heating systems varies<br>
from battery to battery. A significant proportion of the total coke gas produced from<br>
coking is returned to the heating system for burning. The process of filling the oven<br>
with coal is called charging. In Tata Steel the coals are stamped charged. It is a<br>
technology that involves formation of a stable coal cake with finely crushed coal by<br>
mechanically stamping outside the oven and pushing the cake thus formed inside the<br>
oven for carbonization.<br><br>
Once charged, coal is gradually carbonized to form "coke" in a period of 20-24<br>
hours depending on the battery and the way it is operated. Times may vary<br>
even wider depending on the battery. The coking time can be changed<br>
depending on production requirements.<br>
During carbonization, coking coals undergo transformation into plastic state. It<br>
first swells and then re-solidifies to produce semi-coke and then finally the coke.<br>
In the initial stage of carbonization, plastic layers from adjacent to the heating<br>
walls, and with the progress of time, the plastic layers move towards the center<br>
of oven from either side and ultimately meet each other at the center. The<br>
quality and quantity of plastic layer determines the inherent strength of coke<br>
matrix.<br>
According to the invention there is provided a system to control carbonization of<br>
coke by predicting ready-oven temperature of coke oven during coking process<br>
by generating matrix character for process parameters such as charge<br>
temperature, coking-time, peaks and slopes of oven temperature patterns of<br><br>
coking cycles by observing continuously data through thermocouples located in<br>
the middle of twin regenerators, the thermocouple being connected and<br>
correlated with algorithm to filter out temperature drops by continuously<br>
evaluating the slope termed as K-slope of the filtered trend of the temperature<br>
pattern, normalizing the temperature trend by developing character to common<br>
charging temperature, correlating the same with developing character of oven<br>
temperature in the last hours of the coking cycle, coke end temperature being<br>
measured by pyrometer, computing graph of ready oven temperature on<br>
normalizing all the temperature trends against K-slopes, forming a set of a<br>
ready-oven temperature of the running trend, predicating ready-oven<br>
temperature of the running trend by shifting the average back to its original<br>
trend value and scheduling strategy on ready-oven temperature, the sequential<br>
control steps are being carried out by interfacing algorithm with a controller and<br>
operated through a software generated for this purpose.<br><br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention will be best understood by the description with reference<br>
to the accompanying drawings in which<br>
Figure 1 represents a schematic diagram of coke-oven battery.<br>
Figure 2 represents a schematic diagram of operation of the<br>
coke oven according to the proposed invention.<br>
Figure 3 represents an oven temperature over the<br>
carbonization cycle of a typical oven.<br>
Figure 4 represents an oven temperature over the<br>
carbonization cycle for another typical oven.<br><br>
Figure 5 represents a graph showing ready-oven-temperature versus<br>
coke-end temperature (CET) (ROV and CET)<br>
Figure 6 represents a graph showing K-slope values Vs ready<br>
oven temperature [K-slope Vs ROV) where fixed time = 950)]<br>
Figure 7 represents percentage error (actual prediction) of<br>
ready-oven-temperature evaluated from K-slopes<br>
as distributed over number of data sets.<br>
Figure 8 represents a flow sheet illustrating the sequential<br>
steps of predicting ROV with correlating CET / CMT<br>
(coke mass temperature).<br>
Figure 1 relates to an existing general schematic diagram of coke-oven battery.<br>
Normally the coking time of a battery is a fixed time period of 20 hours. It is<br>
assumed that carbonization completes within the period. In case in an oven the<br>
carbonization completes before hand the oven would have to wait till the end of<br>
the coking period to discharge the ready coke. Additional energy is supplied to<br>
the oven in the last few hours or minutes of waiting time to maintain the coke<br>
temperature which could have been saved if the cokes are discharged just in<br>
time. In other cases an oven may not be ready in 20 hours.<br><br>
The present invention is related to development of a system which predicts the ready-<br>
coke temperature in an early stage of carbonization. This would help to control the<br>
coking process of a battery in two-folds:<br>
(a)	adjusting the heat input during the coking process to attain the desired coke-<br>
mass temperature.<br>
(b)	reduce the coking period if an oven is ready with the coke.<br>
Literature survey evidences that there is no prior art which is related to energy<br>
savings of coke-oven battery by adjusting heat input or coking time of ovens. Majority<br>
of the prior published or patent literature are related to productivity or design of<br>
batteries. The technologies that are published are like "production of soft coke",<br>
"design of bee-hive oven", "construction of bricks using fly-ash", "dust collection<br>
system of coke-oven" and similarly others.<br><br>
Underneath each oven (c/o) twin refractory regenerators (4) are located. The<br>
purpose of these regenerators are to preheat the fuel and air which enter the<br>
combustion chamber of the oven. The purpose of two regenerators is that when<br>
one acts as the source of preheating the fuel and the air the other acts as a sink<br>
to absorb heat from the flue gas of combustion which passes through it. After<br>
each reversal, the flue gas alters the path and the source regenerator becomes<br>
the sink and the vice versa. A thermocouple (TC) is installed in the middle of<br>
these two regenerators which may be treated as the representative oven<br>
temperature during coking cycle. The firing of flue gas arrangement is indicated<br>
by 3. The both way arrows indicate the movement of flue gas of combustion<br>
through the refractory walls (1) of the oven. Numerals 2 indicates emergence of<br>
flame and flue gas from the c/o.<br>
Figures 3 and 4 show the trend of oven-temperature (as measured by the<br>
thermocouple) observed over two different ovens of about 20 hours cycle. The<br>
trends show that the oven-temperature keeps rising for over an hour after the<br><br>
coal charging. The temperature rise is nominal of around 5-10° C after which<br>
the temperature descends down. It ascends again after it reaches the valley.<br>
The oven-temperature experiences multiple such ripples over the entire coking-<br>
cycle out of which the first peak and the slop are significantly large by<br>
magnitudes. This trend is similar to all ovens and statistically 95% of 700<br>
randomly selected oven-temperature cycles of two different batteries follow the<br>
trend. 5% abnormal cycles which do not follow the trend are due to the facts<br>
like operational or instrumental abnormalities.<br>
Although oven-temperature cycles follow the same pattern, the process<br>
parameters like charge-temperature, coking-time, peaks and slopes of the trend<br>
are different for different ovens and different for different coking periods of the<br>
same oven as well. This proves that the oven-temperature pattern is an intrinsic<br>
property of the carbonization phenomenon and is not influenced by the oven-<br>
geometry, charging-schedule, reversal heating, energy input, refractory etc.<br>
With this, the logical conclusion can be made as that the final coke temperature<br>
of an oven is strongly co-related to the peaks and slopes of the trend.<br><br>
This invention relates to the system which predicts the ready coke-temperature at a<br>
very early stage of carbonization cycle using the peaks and gradients of the trend.<br>
The method is derived statistically using 700 and odd over-temperature cycles<br>
(randomly selected). The error percentage of predicted and actual temperature is<br>
around 0.4%. This invention also evolves a new strategy of sequencing the oven<br>
pushing based on the predetermined ready-oven-temperature which would help in<br>
energy savings in battery.<br>
An algorithm has been developed to trace the temperature-trend on real time. Since<br>
the thermocouple is located in the middle of twin regenerators the temperature drops<br>
during the phase-shift from one regenerator to the other are also reflected in the<br>
temperature trend. The algorithm continuously evaluates the slope of the filtered<br>
trend. The magnitude and sign of slopes of the past indicates the future pattern of the<br>
trend. The slope values and signs also indicate whether the trend at the current time<br>
has reached a peak or valley.<br><br>
Once the temperature trend reaches the first peak and starts descending<br>
towards the valley, the slope of the descending trend after the first peak has<br>
significant role in predicting the temperature of the oven in the last hour of the<br>
coking cycle. The slope is termed as K-slope in this study and the last-hour<br>
oven-temperature is termed as ready-oven temperature. A table termed as<br>
ROV-slope (Table 1.0) in page 17 is constructed by sets of ready-oven-<br>
temperature and the corresponding K-slope values.<br>
For an oven, this table is used to predict the ready-oven-temperature at an early<br>
stage of coking cycle. The detail of the table is presented in the following<br>
sections.<br>
Filtration and Normalization of trend<br>
As discussed in the previous section and as shown in Figures 3 and 4 the oven<br>
temperature trend progresses in a series of cyclic wavelets of rise and fall of<br><br>
temperature. As explained earlier, the temperature drops are due to phase-shift<br>
of regenerators. Control through the algorithm smoothens the trend by<br>
eliminating the valleys of the wavelets and reserving the peaks.<br>
The oven temperature at the time of charging varies significantly from one oven<br>
to another. The variation of charging temperature ranges from 1100° C to 1300°<br>
C. The first task of the algorithm is to normalize the temperature trends to a<br>
common charging temperature. It means that all the trends are shifted up or<br>
down in order to have a common charging temperature. The common charging<br>
temperature can be specified by the user and as default it is considered as 1200°<br>
C. As an illustration it can be stated that if an oven-temperature at the charging<br>
time is 1100° C then the temperature trend of that oven is shifted up by 100° C<br>
as if the oven is charged at common charging temperature of 1200° C. If<br>
another is charged at 1300° C the trend of that oven is shifted down by 100° as<br>
if it is charged at the common charging temperature of 1200° C.<br><br>
The temperature trends are normalized first and filtered as it progresses.<br>
Concurrently the slopes and K-slop factor are evaluated on the filtered trend for<br>
prediction of ready-oven-temperature.<br>
Ready oven temperature<br>
It is evident from the process that the oven-temperature in the last hour of the<br>
coking cycle has strong co-relationship with the coke-end-temperature (CET) or<br>
coke-mass temperature (CMT). The coke-end-temperature is measured by the<br>
pyrometer which is installed in the coke dump car. Figure 5 plots the average<br>
oven temperature of the last hour of the coking cycles and coke-end-<br>
temperatures (CET) of 100 different ovens which evidences the co-relationship.<br>
The ratio of these two temperatures is close to 0.8. For the convenience in<br>
terminology the oven which is in the state of last hour of coking cycle is called<br>
ready-oven and the average temperature of the last hour is called ready-oven-<br>
temperature.<br><br>
Rov-K-slope<br>
Seven hundered (700) coking cycles data of randomly selected ovens of two<br>
batteries of Tata Steel have been collected for this study. All the temperature<br>
trends of the cycles are normalized, filtered and K-slopes of all them are<br>
evaluated. The ready-oven-temperature of the cycles are plotted against the K-<br>
slopes. Figure 6 shows the plotted graph. The graph shape indicates that the<br>
ready-oven-temperature is a function of K-slope and is estimated with bounds<br>
from the K-slope value. The K-slope values ranges from - 0.004 - 0.03 with the<br>
decrement of 0.001. The table (Table 1.0) is the collection of sets of ready-<br>
oven-temperatures against different K-slopes values. The mean of each set is<br>
also included in the set as the most significant member of the set.<br>
The K-slope of a running trend, once computed can be searched as a key in the<br>
table. The corresponding set of the ready-oven-temperature is the list of<br>
probable ready-oven-temperature of the running trend. The average of the set<br>
is first de-normalized by shifting it back to its original trend values and then can<br>
be declared as the predicted ready-oven-temperature of the running trend.<br><br>
The sets of ready-oven temperature are continuously updated with each coking<br>
cycle. Frequency of occurrence of each data in each is monitored continuously.<br>
The data of very low or no re-occurrence can be eliminated from the set. The<br>
frequency of occurrence is used as a weight factor of averaging the set<br>
members. Introduction of a new member may occur any time.<br>
Validation<br>
Predicted ready-oven-temperature of 500 ovens are validated with actual data.<br>
The percentage of error obtained is 0.4% which is within industrial acceptance<br>
limits.<br>
Scheduling strategy on ready-oven-temperature:<br>
Coke-oven battery follows a sequence of charging the ovens. A typical sequence<br>
that is commonly followed is 1-5-8-12-16	which means that the fourth oven<br>
from the current one will be charged after charging the current one.<br><br>
The proposed scheduling strategy will follow the sequence of sorted ready-oven-<br>
temperature in descending order.<br>
In the existing practice the coke cycle is 20 hours long. It is only after 20 hours<br>
(after coke discharge) the coke mass temperature (CMT) is measured. If CMT is<br>
found lower or higher than the desired temperature then there is no means to<br>
correct the coke-mass temperature other than accept it and use it in blast<br>
furnace.<br>
But in the present invention CMT is evaluated in the very early time of coking<br>
cycle (within 2 hours after coal-cake charging) by using algorithm, which<br>
algorithm evaluates ROV. Since ROV is distinctively related to CMT so the<br>
algorithm is indirectly evaluating CMT and heat input to the battery can be<br>
controlled accordingly to get the coke discharged at desired CMT.<br><br><br>
The present invention as herein described and illustrated should not be read in a<br>
restrictive manner as many variations, modifications, adaptation and changes are<br>
possible within the limit and scope of the invention as encampused within the<br>
