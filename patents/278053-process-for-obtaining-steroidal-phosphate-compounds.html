				<td>PROCESS FOR OBTAINING<br>
STEROIDAL PHOSPHATE COMPOUNDS<br>
The present invention relates to a process for preparing 21-disodium phosphate<br>
pregnane derivatives, and to compounds so prepared and their use in medicine.<br>
The present invention relates to a new process for obtaining 21-disodium phosphate<br>
pregnane derivative compounds of formula [ I ], wherein X=R=H or X=F and R=a-CH3<br>
or X=F and R=ß-CH3,<br>
<br>
Description of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a new process for obtaining preferably solid 21-<br>
disodium phosphate pregnane compounds of formula [I] which comprises spray drying<br>
a solution containing compound of formula [ I ]. Preferably, the solvent is water,<br>
wherein the concentration of the solution is preferably from 2% to 30% w/w, even more<br>
preferably 3% to 5%.<br>
A particular feature of this invention is that the process herein disclosed minimises<br>
degradation of the 21-disodium phosphate pregnane compounds during drying, thus<br>
yielding compound [ I ] with a high purity. It is well known that fast degradation of these<br>
sodium phosphate salts occurs. For example, when storing betamethasone 21-<br>
phospahte at a temperature of 40°C and a relative humidity of 75% after one month<br>
high levels of decomposition products are observed, signifying that the products no<br>
longer complies with Pharmacopoeia monographs.<br>
Another aspect of this invention is that a process is provided wherein the compounds of<br>
formula [ I ] are obtained in the form of an amorphous solid.<br>
One further aspect of the invention herein disclosed is that is that the process<br>
described to obtain solid compounds of formula [ I ], is easily scaled up and can be<br>
applied at an industrial scale. In particular, solid betamethasone 21-disodium<br>
phosphate, [ I ] where R = ß-CH3 and X = F, can be obtained on a large scale by spray<br>
drying as described hereinbelow. Solid dexamethasone 21-disodium phosphate [I ]<br>
where R = a-CH3 and X = F, and prednisolone di-sodium phosphate [ I ] where R = X =<br>
H and other similar derivatives may be prepared by the same method.<br>
Prior Art<br>
Betamethasone 21-disodium phosphate is a synthetic corticosteroid having activity as<br>
an anti-inflammatory which is used to treat conditions such as arthritis, dermatitis and<br>
allergies. GB 913,941 discloses the preparation of 21-phosphate derivatives of 16b-<br>
alkyl-11-oxygenated-17a,21-dihydroxy-3,20-diketo-1,4-pregnadienes, Betamethasone<br>
21-sodium phosphate included, by following the synthetic route represented in scheme<br>
I.<br>
Scheme 1. Synthetic route disclosed in GB 913 941.<br>
GB 913,941 does not teach how to obtain the 21-phosphates sodium derivatives as<br>
solids.<br>
GB 952,193 discloses a process for the manufacture of steroid-21-orthophosphates<br>
[ VII ] and their physiologically compatible water-soluble salts by treatment of the<br>
diamido group of steroid 21-diamido-orthophosphates [ VI ] with an acidic reagent.<br>
<br>
The steroid 21-orthophosphates is prepared by treatment of the corresponding steroid<br>
21-diamido orthophosphates with mineral acids or strong organic acids such as organic<br>
sulphonic acids. The corresponding water soluble salts are obtained by treatment of the<br>
steroid 21-orthophosphates with caustic alkali, alkali metal hydrogen carbonate or alkali<br>
metal carbonate. The salts are dried under reduce pressure.<br>
A shorter route of synthesis is described in GB 1,148,453 which claims a process for<br>
preparing 21-phosphates of a "corticoid-type" by reaction of a 21-hydroxy "corticoid-<br>
type" steroid with pyrophosphoryl tetrachloride followed by hydrolysis.<br>
<br>
US 3,966,778 claims the production of 21-phosphate corticoids having unprotected<br>
hydroxyl groups radicals at least at the 17a and 21-position. The phosphate corticoids<br>
are isolated by evaporation of the solvents under reduced pressure.<br>
US 2,939,873 claims a process for producing tertiary lower alkyl amine salts of<br>
unsaturated pregnane-21-dihydrogen phosphate esters having a general formula [ IV]<br>
and [ V ], where R1 is selected from the groups:<br>
<br>
and R2, R3 and R4 are lower alkyl radicals, which comprises combining the<br>
corresponding starting materials [ II ] and [ III], wherein R1 is as previously defined, and<br>
<br>
Y is a radical selected from the group consisting of halogens with an atomic weight of at<br>
least 35 and lower hydrocarbon sulfonyloxy radicals of the formula OSO2R5 where R5<br>
is a hydrocarbon radical containing from one to 10 carbon atoms, with a tertiary lower<br>
alkyl amine phosphate. The steroid phosphate amine salts are converted to the<br>
corresponding steroid dihydrogen phosphate free acids and alkali metal salts thereof.<br>
Conversion to the dihydrogen phosphate is effected by contact of a solution of the<br>
steroid phosphate amine salt with a strongly acidic anion exchange resin in its<br>
hydrogen form. The sodium salt is prepared by reaction of the phosphate free acid with<br>
sodium hydroxide or with a methanolic solution of sodium methoxide and is air-dried.<br>
Processes for preparing phosphate derivatives of Cortisone and Hydrocortisone are<br>
claimed in US 3,068,223 where the phosphate group is introduced into the 21 position<br>
of the steroid by reaction of the 21-lodo derivative with silver dibenzylphosphate. This<br>
patent states that the salts of the 21-phosphate cortisone or hydrocortisone may be<br>
prepared by reacting the compound with an aqueous solution of alkali or alkaline bases<br>
or salts such as hydroxides, carbonates, bicarbonates or acetates. The sodium salt of<br>
cortisone phosphate is dried in air and no further details are given on how to dry the<br>
other salts.<br>
According to the present invention, there is provided a process for obtaining steroidal<br>
21-disodium phosphate compounds of formula [I], which process comprises spray<br>
drying a solution comprising a compound of formula [ I ].<br>

Preferably, the solution is spray dried at a drying temperature of 105°C or below. More<br>
preferably, the drying temperature is from 80 to 100°C. A drying temperature of about<br>
85°C is particularly preferred.<br>
It is preferable that the pH of the solution is below pH 9. More preferably, the pH of the<br>

Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
This invention provides a process comprising spray drying a solution containing a<br>
compound of formula [ I ]. Advantageously, the process of the present invention<br>
prevents degradation of the compound during isolation of solid material.<br>
The compound of formula [ I ] can be dissolved in a suitable solvent , such as water,<br>
and the solvent can be safely evaporated in a spray drying equipment. Any suitable<br>
solution concentration can be used. However, a solution concentration of 2-30% w/w is<br>
preferred, even more preferably the solution has a concentration of 3% to 5% w/w. By<br>
"% w/w" we mean the mass of the compound of formula [I] as a percentage of the mass<br>
of the total solution. The concentration to be employed will generally be limited by the<br>
solubility of [ I ] in the solvent. Water is a preferred solvent since it is a non toxic solvent<br>
which can be handled without special health and safety concerns. In addition, the<br>
residual level of water in the final product can be as high as 10% w/w.<br>
Spray drying may be performed using any suitable equipment, for example, using<br>
equipment that is commercially available. Any suitable drying gases can be used, such<br>
as, for example, air or nitrogen. A variety of atomisation methods can be used,<br>
depending, for instance, on the equipment being used. For example, a pneumatic spray<br>
nozzle orifice of 0.7 mm is suitable although alternate atomization methods such as<br>
rotary, pressure and ultrasonic nozzles can be used in a variety of equipment. The<br>
preferential atomization gas flow in terms of normal litres per hour can be adjusted to<br>
the equipment in use and any suitable atomisation gas flow can be used. Typically, for<br>
a smaller scale unit, 357 to 670 litres per hour is preferred. In a preferred embodiment,<br>
the nozzle assembly can be cooled with a suitable fluid during spray drying to minimize<br>
product degradation.<br>
Any suitable drying temperature can be used. Drying temperatures involved in the<br>
spray drying of the aqueous solution of compound of formula [ I ] are typically those<br>
employed in the spray drying of aqueous feedstocks. For example, preferably outlet<br>
temperatures range from 65°C to 108°C but are more preferably 80-100°C.<br>
Any suitable solution flow rate can be used. Solution flow rate may preferably be from 1<br>
to 20 ml/min, more preferably from 3 to 9 ml/min for the 0.7 mm nozzle.<br>
Inlet temperature may be adjusted to attain a suitable range of outlet temperatures. For<br>
example, the inlet temperature can be from 80 to 200°C.<br>
In a particularly preferred embodiment, the outlet temperature, atomization flow rate,<br>
solution concentration and solution flow rate, among other tested parameters, can be<br>
combined in order to obtain compound [ I ] complying with the European<br>
Pharmacopoeia (EP) and United States Pharmacopoeia (USP). In particular, the above<br>
parameters may be combined in order to achieve the required limits for residual<br>
solvents and related substances. For example, the concentration of the solution has<br>
been found to have opposite effects on the level of water and on the level volatile<br>
solvents in the spray dried product. An increase in solution concentration was observed<br>
to result in an increase in the content of volatile solvents and a decrease in the level of<br>
water. The best compromise was found to be with a solution concentration of about 5%<br>
w/w. At this concentration level, betamethasone 21-sodium phosphate obtained by<br>
spray drying, with an outlet temperature of 85°C and an atomization gas flow of 357<br>
normal litres per hour and a solution flow rate of 6 ml/min, had a water content of 7.9%<br>
w/w and a total content of volatile solvents below 3000 ppm. Accordingly, these<br>
conditions are particularly preferred, but not essential.<br>
The outlet temperature and the pH of the solution may affect the purity of the spray<br>
dried product. For example, outlet temperatures above 105°C may promote significant<br>
degradation. Accordingly, it is preferred to use outlet temperatures of about 80°C to<br>
about 100°C. An outlet temperature of 85°C is particularly preferred. Similarly, the<br>
spray drying of solutions with a pH of about 9 may lead to higher levels of degradation.<br>
Accordingly, it is preferred to have a solution pH of below about pH 9, suitably below<br>
pH 8. Even more preferably, the pH of the solution to be spray dried may be 7.6 to 7.9.<br>
If the pH of the solution is outside this range then it may preferably be adjusted by<br>
addition of any suitable acid or alkali, for example, an acid such as dilute hydrochloric<br>
acid.<br>
One disadvantage of drying compound [ I ] according to known methods such as the<br>
use of a fluidized bed drier is that severe decomposition of the compound of formula [I]<br>
during drying may occur. Decomposition is observed at temperatures equal to or higher<br>
than 40°C and occurs either under vacuum or under nitrogen atmosphere. A typical<br>
degradation product is betamethasone along with unknown related substances, which<br>
are detected by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).<br>
<br>
Surprisingly, spray drying compound [ I ], R = |3CH3 and X = F, according to the<br>
process of the present invention allows drying of the product in a controlled way so that<br>
the dried betamethasone 21-disodium phosphate thus obtained contains desirable<br>
levels of degradation products such as Betamethasone and related substances, for<br>
example levels of degradation products below 0.10% (HPLC area %).<br>
Another disadvantage of the known methods is that sometimes compound [ I ], wherein<br>
R = PCH3 and X = F, may precipitate as a solvate of organic solvents such as<br>
methanol or acetone, retaining a level of solvents higher than those allowed by<br>
International Guidelines and Pharmacopoeias making the product unsuitable for<br>
pharmaceutical applications. When drying compound [ I ], wherein R = PCH3 and X =<br>
F, using the process according to the present invention, solvates of organic solvents<br>
such as methanol and or isopropanol are not formed and the compound [I], for<br>
example, Betamethasone 21-Disodium Phosphate, obtained complies with<br>
Pharmacopoeia limits for residual solvents.<br>
The compounds of formula [ I ] so obtained using the method of this invention are<br>
amorphous solids The X-ray powder diffraction patterns of betamethasone 21-<br>
disodium phosphate, of dexamethasone 21-phosphate and of prednisolone 21-<br>
phosphate, obtained from spray drier according to the process herein disclosed are<br>
depicted in fig. 1, fig. 2 and fig. 3, respectively. These XRPD diffraction patterns have a<br>
broad, diffuse and low intensity peak which is characteristic of an amorphous material.<br>
Compound [ I ] employed in the present invention may be prepared by any known<br>
process.<br>
Examples 1, 2 and 3 illustrate the invention and certain preferred embodiments and are<br>
not intended to limit the scope of the invention. The experiments reported were carried<br>
out using a BUCHI model B-290 Advanced spray dryer, with a spray orifice of two fluid<br>
nozzle with 0.7 mm orifice diameter.<br>
Example 1: Spray drying of betamethasone 21-disodium phosphate<br>
Wet betamethasone 21-disodium phosphate obtained by applying literature techniques<br>
and having a purity of 99.8% (HPLC area %) was dissolved in water to give a 5% w/w<br>

addition of hydrochloric acid 1N. The outlet temperature was kept between 80°C and<br>
100°C, the atomization flow was between 357-670 normal litres per hour and the<br>
solution flow rate was between 5 ml/min and 9 ml/min. The product was collected in a<br>
high performance cyclone. The product [betamethasone 21-phosphate] was obtained<br>
with a purity of 99.6% and with residual solvents complying with USP and EP<br>
Pharmacopoeias (Methanol: 428 ppm; Isopropanol: 2088 ppm; Water, by Karl-Fischer:<br>
8.0% w/w).<br>
Example 2: Spray drying of dexamethasone 21-disodium phosphate<br>
Dexamethasone 21-disodium phosphate with a purity of 99.2% (HPLC area %) was<br>
dissolved in water to give a 5% w/w solution. The pH of the solution was adjusted to<br>
7.6/7.9 by addition of hydrochloric acid 1N. The outlet temperature was kept between<br>
80°C and 100°C, the atomization flow was between 357-670 normal litres per hour and<br>
the solution flow rate was between 5 ml/min and 9 ml/min. The product was collected in<br>
a high performance cyclone. The product [dexamethasone 21-phosphate] was obtained<br>
with a purity of 99.2% (HPLC area %).<br>
Example 3: Spray drying of prednisolone 21-disodium phosphate<br>
Prednisolone 21-disodium phosphate with a purity of 98.4% (HPLC area %) was<br>
dissolved in water to give a 5% w/w solution. The pH of the solution was adjusted to<br>
7.6/7.9 by addition of hydrochloric acid 1N. The outlet temperature was kept between<br>
80°C and 100°C, the atomization flow was between 357-670 normal litres per hour and<br>
the solution flow rate was between 5 ml/min and 9 ml/min. The product was collected in<br>
a high performance cyclone. The product [prednisolone 21-phosphate] was obtained<br>
with a purity of 99.2% (HPLC area %).<br>
