				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>This invention relates to a process for producing polyisobutenes and more particularly to an improved method of producing polyisobutenes by cationic polymerisation of a mixed C4 feedstock.<br>
Methods of polymerising isobutene, whether pure or in an isomeric mixture as in a C4 raffinate, using Lewis Acid catalysts are well known and disclosed extensively in prior art.   Typical of such catalysts are the halides of aluminium, iron, zinc, titanium, tin, mercury and boron.   These catalysts can be optionally used in conjunction with co-catalysts such as eg water, alcohol, organic acids, mineral acids, ethers and alkyl halides to enhance catalyst activity.   The polymerisation reaction can be carried out in the liquid or gaseous phase, batchwise or continuously, at temperatures ranging fiom-100°C to +100°C.<br>
It is also well known that the chain termination step during the polymerisation of isobutene using the aforementioned catalyst systems generally results in a 'final' double bond which imparts a degree of reactivity to the polymer for subsequent reactions, such as epoxidation to form the corresponding epoxide or an addition reaction with maleic anhydride to form the corresponding polyisobutenyl succinic anhydride. However, the termination step, if not properly controlled can result in the final double bond being located either in a relatively less reactive internal position such as 1 2,2-trisubstituted or 1,1,2,2-tetrasubstituted position or in the more desirable, highly reactive terminal 1,1-disubstituted position (hereafter "terminal vinylidene" group) as shown below in each of which R is an alkyl g;-oup:<br>
CH2=C(CH3)R	(CH3)2.C=CH.R	(CH3)2C=C(CH3)R<br>
1 1-disubstituted	trisubstituted	tetrasubstituted<br>
In addition to the above, one other problem known to occur during the manufacture of polyisobutene is halogen incorporation from the catalyst(s)used for polymerisation.<br>
In view of the above, it has long been the objective of research in this field to improve the reactivity of the polyisobutene, eg its reactivity towards maleic anhydride, by identifying catalyst(s) capable of polymerising isobutene in such a way that the number of terminal vinylidene groups in the polyisobutene is maximised whilst at the same time minimising the amount of halogen incorporated therein.   Whilst it is known to take a substantially pure isobutene feed and then polymerise the same, the purification of mixed feeds to isolate a substantially pure isobutene content thereof is relatively cumbersome and expensive and hence is not commercially attractive. Processes are described for using commercially available mixed feeds for this purpose eg by Bqerzel et al in US-A-4152499, Samson in US-A-4605808, Eaton in US-A-5068490, Chung et al in "Polymer Bulletin", 30, 385-391 (1993)and Miln et al in EP-A-0489508.   None of these or other prior art in this field, however, teaches that a polyisobutene having an even higher percentage of terminal vinylidene groups and lower levels of halogen incorporation than hitherto achieved from a mixed C4 hydrocarbon feedstock can be obtained if such feedstock is pre-treated in a particular way to substantially reduce the level of 1-butene content thereof.<br>
One of the objectives of the present invention is to produce, from a given mixed C4 hydrocarbon feedstock, polyisobutenes which exhibit higher reactivity towards eg maleic anhydride which, for example, in the processes described above, would be achieved by obtaining higher terminal vinylidene content than that obtained hitherto from the said feedstock. A further objective of the present invention is to produce from a given feedstock polyisobutenes which have a lower concentration of halogen than that obtained hitherto from said feedstock when using halogenated compounds as catalysts for the cationic polymerization reaction.<br>
Accordingly, there is provided a process for producing polyisobutenes having a molecular weight (Mn) in the range from 500-5000 as measured by GPC from a feedstock comprising a mixture of C4 hydrocarbons and containing isobutene and at least 5% by weight of 1-butene, characterized in that it comprises the following successive steps:<br>
(1)	pre-treating the feedstock in a manner such as herein described in order to reduce the 1-butene content thereof to a level which is at least 20% lower than that of the 1-butene content in the initial mixed C4 hydrocarbon feedstock prior to the pre-treatment thereof, and<br>
(2)	polymerising the resulting feedstock thus pre-treated in the presence of a cationic polymerisation catalyst of the kind such as herein described and comprising at least one halogenated compound of the kind such as herein described to produce the polyisobutene which has more than 65% of the unsaturated linkages therein as vinylidene groups (ie=CH2 groups) and has less than 50 ppm halogen.<br>
The polyisobutenes produced by the claimed process are not intended or capable of being used as drug or medicine. They usually are used as dispersant or lubricant additives in automotive oils or in adhesives.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention is a method of producing polyisobutenes of Mn 500-5000 as measured by GPC from a feedstock comprising a mixture of C4 hydrocarbons and containing isobutene and at least 5% by weight of 1-butene using a cationic polymerisation catalyst comprising at least one halogenated compound,  characterised in that priorto polymerisation, the feedstock is subjected to a pre-treatment step in order to reduce the 1-butene content thereof to a level which is at least 20% lower than that of the 1-butene content in the initial mixed C4 hydrocarbon feedstock prior to the pre-treatment thereof and the polyisobutene so formed (a) has more than 65% of the unsaturated linkages therein as vinylidene groups (ie =CH2 groups) and (b) is substantially free of halogen.<br>
For the purposes of the present invention, the expression "pre-treatment" excludes any pre-treatment in which one of more of the hydrocarbon components in the mixed C4 feedstock is converted to an ether such as eg conversion of isobutene to methyl tertiary butyl ether followed by back cracking thereof to isobutene which is described in our copending published application No. W093/21139 (PCT/GB/00823).<br>
The feedstock comprising a mixture of C4 hydrocarbons may be<br>
a.	a raffinate from the steam cracking process after the selective<br>
separation of 1,3-butadiene, the so-called "butadiene raffinate" or<br>
"Raffinate I" feedstock, or,<br>
b.	a hydrocarbon stream obtained during the refining of crude oil<br>
comprising primarily of butanes and butenes (hereaftere termed<br>
"refinery B-B") from catalytic crackers.<br>
Some of these feedstocks can be found eg in a book entitled "C4-Hydrocarbons And Derivatives, Resources, Production, Marketing" by Schulze &amp; Homann, published by Springer-Verlag (1989).   For instance: Raffinate I has the following components (w/w) of the total composition:<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br><br>
The mixed C4 feedstock is suitably pretreated by subjecting the feedstock to selective hydroisomerisation conditions. The conditions of hydroisomerisation are such that they are sufficient to hydrogenate only the acetylenic compounds and dienes in the mixed C4 feedstock but are also capable of isomerising 1-butene in the feedstream in the presence of a catalyst. Catalysts that may be used for this hydroisomerisation reaction are suitably eg palladium on an alumina support. Such catalysts which are known to function in this manner are commercially available eg from Procatalyse Corporation, Sud-Chemie and Calsicat. The concentration of palladium is usually in the range from 0.1-0.5% by weight of the combined total of catalyst and alumina and the surface area of the support is suitably in the range from 20-300 m2/g, preferably from 50-150m2/g. The broad reaction conditions for hydroisomerisation are described for instance in prior published GB-A-2057006 and these conditions are incorporated herein by reference. Typical conditions for this reaction are:<br>
Pressure       -	0.1-20 MPa, preferably 500-3000 KPa<br>
(5-30 Barg)<br>
Temperature -	0-200°C, preferably from 5-100°C<br>
LHSV	-	0.2-30, preferably 5-30 volumes of<br>
hydrocarbon/volume of catalyst/hr<br>
For high butadiene containing feedstocks, two sequential reactors may be necessary, so that hydrogenation of butadiene occurs in the first reactor and isomerisation of 1 -butene occurs in the second reactor.   Finally, the mole ratio of hydrogen to 1-butene in the feedstock prior to pretreatment is suitably in the region of 0.01-2.0 : 1, preferably from 0.1-2.0 : 1.<br>
The resultant pre-treated product after the hydroisomerisation step has a 1-butene content which is at least 20% lower than that of the initial mixed C4 hydrocarbon feedstock, suitably at least 40% lower and preferably at least 70% lower than that of the initial mixed C4 hydrocarbon feedstock prior to the pre-treatment thereof. This step also eliminates substantially all the acetylenic and diene compounds.<br>
The cationic polymerisation catalyst comprising at least one halogenated compound used for polymerising the pre-treated mixed hydrocarbon feed significantly low in 1-butene is suitably selected from conventional catalysts such as<br>
i)	BF3 either used<br>
a.	as such, or,<br>
b.	as a complex thereof with with one or more alcohols,<br>
carboxylic acids or ethers, particularly ethers having at least<br>
one tertiary carbon bound to the oxygen atom of the ether, or,<br>
c.	as (a) or (b) above in combination with a co-catalyst such as<br>
an alcohol, ether, organic carboxylic acids or water, or,<br>
d.	deposited as (a), (b) or (c) above on a support such as<br>
eg silica, alumina and the like;<br>
ii)        an ether of the general formula BF2OR", or, an alkyl or an aryl<br>
derivative of boron fluoride of the general formulae BF2R", where R"<br>
is an alkyl or an aryl group; and iii)       tin tetrachloride as such or together with a mineral acid or an alkyl<br>
halide as co-catalyst;<br>
Typical examples are (i) tin tetrachloride with eg tertiary butyl chloride, and (ii) the complexes of boron trifluoride with an alcohol such as eg ethanol, isopropanol or secondary butanol, or, a carboxylic acid such as eg formic or acetic acid, or, an ether such as eg an alkyl tert-butyl ether in which the alkyl group is selected from methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl and sec-butyl groups. The complexes may either be preformed or formed in situ by the addition of the relevant components separately into the reaction mixture.<br>
The amount of polymerisation catalyst used would be in the range from 0.001 to 10% by weight, preferably from 0.005-10% by weight based on the isobutene content of the feedstock being polymerised.<br>
The polymerisation reaction is suitably carried out at a temperature in the range from -100°C to +100°C, preferably from -40°C to +40°C and a pressure in the range from 10 to 5000 KPa.<br>
The polymerisation reaction is suitably terminated by adding an excess amount of a basic material such as ammonia gas, aqueous ammonium hydroxide solution or aqueous sodium hydroxide solution. Following evaporation of the unreacted C4 monomers, the crude deactivated reaction product is then washed several times with distilled or de-ionised water in order to remove any remaining inorganic materials. Finally, the crude, washed polymer sample is vacuum distilled in order to removeany light polymer.<br>
A feature of the present invention is that the product produced using the pre-treated C4 feedstock is not only superior in terms of its terminal vinylidene group content eg a vinylidene content of &gt;655%, preferably &gt;80%, but said product is also substantially free of halogen, especially if the polymerisation catalyst used is eg a boron trifluoride catalyst or a derivative or preformed complex thereof.<br>
By the expression "substantially free of halogen" is meant here and throughout the specification that the polyisobutene has less than 50 ppm of halogen, preferably less than 40 ppm of halogen.<br>
The polyisobutene products of the present invention have a number average molecular weight (Mn) in the range from 500-5000, suitably in the range from 700-3500, typically from 750-3000 as determined by gel permeation chromatography (GPC).<br>
The process of the present invention can be carried out batchwise or continuously.<br>
The process of the present invention is further illustrated with reference to the following Examples.<br>
