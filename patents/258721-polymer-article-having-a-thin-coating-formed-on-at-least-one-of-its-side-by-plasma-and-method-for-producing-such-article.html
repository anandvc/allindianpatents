The invention relates to a polymer article having a<br>
thin coating formed on at least one of its side by plasma<br>
and a method for manufacturing such an article.<br>
The invention relates also to a polymer article<br>
manufactured by the method, this article being of any shape<br>
and obtained by injection, extrusion molding, blow molding,<br>
compression molding, vacuum forming and the like.<br>
The invention related more particularly to a method<br>
for manufacturing a polymer, preferentially either<br>
polypropylene or polyethylene, shaped article that is<br>
adapted to be used as a food container by having excellent<br>
surface properties such as reduced tendency of being<br>
stained, good resistance against chemicals, this container<br>
being washable in a dishwasher, and being also able to be<br>
placed either in a refrigerator, or in a freezer or a<br>
microwave oven.<br>
A plasma treatment is a chemical process wherein a<br>
gaseous compound in a given volume is decomposed under<br>
reduced atmosphere by an electrical glow discharge<br>
resulting in the coating of a thin film on the walls of a<br>
container. In the hereunder specification, the term "thin<br>
film" means a film with a thickness less than a few<br>
hundreds of nanometers.<br>
More precisely, Plasma Enhanced Chemical Vapor<br>
Deposition (hereinafter referred to as PECVD) is used for<br>
depositing a variety of thin films at lower temperature<br>
than those utilized in Chemical Vapor Deposition reactors.<br>
PECVD uses electrical energy to generate a glow<br>
discharge in which the energy is transferred into a gas<br><br>
2<br>
mixture. This transforms the gas mixture into reactive<br>
radicals, ions, neutral atoms and molecules and other<br>
exited species.<br>
PECVD is largely used in electronics in depositing<br>
many films such as silicon nitride, diamond like carbon<br>
DLC, poly-silicon, amorphous silicon, silicon oxynitride,<br>
silicon oxide, silicon dioxide.<br>
Exemplarily, the document US 3,485,666 describes a<br>
method of depositing a layer of silicon deposited upon a<br>
surface of a substrate by establishing a plasma adjacent to<br>
said surface in an atmosphere containing a gaseous hydride<br>
of silicon and a gaseoushydride of nitrogen. It is so<br>
obtained a silicon nitride layer which has application in<br>
providing a protective transparent surface coating on an<br>
article of a relatively soft and/or readily damaged<br>
material.<br>
As it is well known, plastics used for containers<br>
permits low molecular gas, such as oxygen and carbon<br>
dioxide, to permeate there through, and furthermore,<br>
plastic sorbs inside therein low molecular inorganic<br>
compound. As a consequence, aroma component can be absorbed<br>
inside the plastic; oxygen can gradually oxidize the<br>
content of the container, deterioring flavor, quality and<br>
purity of said content.<br>
In a way to improve the impermeability of these<br>
kinds of containers, silicon oxide films deposited by<br>
plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition received<br>
considerable attention in the packaging industry due to<br>
their excellent gas barrier performance and their<br>
transparency.<br>
The document US 3,442,686 discloses a flexible<br>
transparent packaging film which has extremely low<br>
permeability to gases and liquids, the film comprising, in<br><br>
3<br>
combination, a flexible transparent organic polymeric base<br>
film, an adherent substantially gas and liquid impermeable<br>
intermediate coating of inorganic material on one surface<br>
of said base film and a sealable adherent top coating of<br>
organic polymeric material on said intermediate coating,<br>
said inorganic material being an oxide' of silicon and said<br>
base film being polyester base film. So, as an oxide of<br>
silicon layer is transparent, it is also known to use oxide<br>
of silicon SiOx in order to improve the impermeability of<br>
polymeric films.<br>
US 5,691,007 discloses a PECVD process whereby a<br>
coating of inorganic material may be placed on 3-D articles<br>
in a closely spaced matrix. This inorganic material can be<br>
a metal oxide such as SiOx wherein x is from about 1.4 to<br>
about 2.5; or an aluminum oxide based composition. The<br>
silicon oxide based composition is substantially dense and<br>
vapor-impervious and is desirably derived from volatile<br>
organosilicon compounds and an oxidizer such as oxygen or<br>
nitrous oxide. Preferably, the thickness of the silicon<br>
oxide based material is about 50 to 400 nm. A flow of 2.6<br>
standard cubic centimeters per minute (seem) HMDSO<br>
(hexamethyldisiloxane) and 70 seem' oxygen is established<br>
and pressure regulated to 120 mTorr by pump throttling and<br>
a 3 min SiOx deposition is produced with an 11.9 MHz 120<br>
watt RF excitation on PET tube.<br>
US 6,338,870 discloses the use of HMDSO or tetra<br>
methyl disiloxane TMDSO for deposition of SiOxCy on PET<br>
laminated product wherein x is within the range of 1.5-2.2<br>
and y is within the range of 0.15-0.80.<br>
The document US 4,830,873 discloses a process for<br>
applying a thin transparent layer onto the surface of<br>
plastic elements wherein the process comprises the steps of<br>
applying onto the surface of the plastic elements a<br><br>
4<br>
monomeric vapor of organic compositions and forming a<br>
protective layer from an electrical gas discharge by means<br>
of a polymerization from the vapor phase with the<br>
assistance of radiation. In the example IV, during the glow<br>
polymerization of pure hexamethyl disiloxrne (HMDS), a<br>
polymer film is generated on the plastic surface. Oxygen<br>
(02) is added into the glow discharge after the formation<br>
of a pure HMDS-glow polymer film of only a few 100<br>
nanometers in order to increase the layer hardness. The<br>
addition of oxygen is performed with a delay with respect<br>
to the start of the polymerization process. It is so<br>
obtained a two layer coating with a first layer formed<br>
during the glow polymerization of pure HMDS and a second<br>
layer formed during the glow polymerization of HMDS and<br>
oxygen. The second layer is then a SiOx-like coating.<br>
The document US 5,718,967 also discloses a laminate<br>
comprising<br>
a)	a plastic substrate having a surface,<br>
b)	an adhesion promoter layer which is a first<br>
plasma polymerized organosilicon compound deposited on the<br>
surface of the substrate in the substantial absence of<br>
oxygen, the organosilicon compound being preferentially<br>
tetramethyldisiloxane,<br>
c)	a protection coating layer which is a second<br>
plasma polymerized organosilicon compound deposited on the<br>
surface of the adhesion promoter layer in the presence of a<br>
sufficient stoichiometric excess of oxygen to form a<br>
silicon polymer of SiOi.8-2.4C0.3-1.oHo.7-4.0. Tne organosilicon<br>
compound is preferentially tetramethyldisiloxane,<br>
d)	an SiOx layer which is a layer of a plasma<br>
polymerized tetramethyldisiloxane deposited on the surface<br>
of the protective coating layer.<br>
US 2003/0215652 discloses a polymeric substrate<br><br>
5<br>
having a barrier coating comprising<br>
a polymeric substrate<br>
a first condensed plasma zone of SiOxCyHz, wherein x<br>
is from 1 to 2.4, y is from 0.2 to 2.4 and z is frpm zero<br>
to 4 on the polymeric substrate wherein the plasma is<br>
generated from an organosilane compound in an oxidizing<br>
atmosphere and<br>
a further condensed plasma zone of SiOx on the<br>
polymeric substrate wherein the plasma is generated from an<br>
organosilane in a oxidizing atmosphere sufficient to form a<br>
SiOx layer.<br>
The plasma formed barrier is then a continuum of a<br>
plasma deposited coating having a composition which varies<br>
from SiOxCyHz at the interface between the plasma layer and<br>
the polymeric surface to SiOx, which is the new surface of<br>
the container.<br>
This substrate is used for polymer bottle,<br>
particularly the non refillable bottle used for carbonated<br>
beverages, the aim of the coating being to be a barrier to<br>
the permeation of odorants, flavorants, ingredients, gas<br>
and water vapor. It is contended that the condensed plasma<br>
coatings of this prior art document may be applied on any<br>
suitable substrate including polyolefin such as<br>
polypropylene or polyethylene. However, examples 1 to 7 in<br>
this prior art document are plasma coatings on PET, no<br>
information being given for examples 8a, 8b and 8c as<br>
regards the polymer used, a 150 microns HDPE film being<br>
mentioned in example 9, PET films being used in example 10,<br>
polycarbonate being used for the last examples 11 to 13.<br>
According to the prior art the reacting gas used like<br>
HMDSO are liquids with a low vapor pressure at ambient<br>
temperature. The use of theses gases requires a carrying<br>
gas like argon to transport the vapor from the container<br><br>
6<br>
towards the reacting chamber. In addition, it is necessary<br>
to heat the gas line to avoid the condensation of the gas<br>
between the container and the reacting chamber.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
The present inventor have noticed that it remains<br>
particularly difficult to obtain SiOx or SiOxCyHz layers<br>
with good adhesion properties on some polymer substrate,<br>
especially polypropylene, using the PECVD route.<br>
The present inventor has also noticed that the<br>
major part of patent literature on PECVD depositions for<br>
polymer subs'trate relates on PET (see e. g. EP 469 926,<br>
FR 2 812 568), the silicon oxide thin films on polypropylen<br>
obtained by prior art PECVD techniques (see example 4 of US<br>
5,378,510 or FR 2814382, FR 2670506, EP 787828) not being<br>
able to produce washable containers having reduced tendency<br>
of being stained.<br>
More precisely, according to the prior art layers,<br>
like in US 4,830,873 or US 5,718,967, it is not obtained a<br>
wash resistant, protective, transparent layer.<br>
In fact, the applicant has noticed that an external<br>
either SiOx-like or SiOx coating shows a bad resistance in<br>
a dishwasher and does not show good anti-staining<br>
properties after several washes in a dishwasher, especially<br>
at higher temperatures.<br>
Furthermore, according to the document US 5,718,<br>
967, the adhesion promoter layer has a thickness of about<br>
100 nm to about 200 nm and the protective coating layer has<br>
a thickness of not less than about 0.1 micron and not<br>
greater than about 2 microns.<br>
In order to improve the transparency feature of the<br>
laminate, and to obtain wash-resistant layers with a<br>
reduced tendency of being stained, it would be preferable<br><br>
7<br>
to have layers with a thickness as reduced as possible.<br>
In fact, the thicker the layer is, the less flexible<br>
it is, and the more breakable it is, especially after<br>
several washes in a dishwasher.<br>

carrots, and tomatoes sauce.<br>

gas with no spontaneous combustion.<br>
An object of the invention is to provide a coating<br>
with a better control of the oxygen percentage in the<br>
coating.<br>
An object of the invention is a polymer article<br>
having a thin coating on at least one of its side,<br>
characterized in that said coating comprises a first<br>
coating of SiOxCyHz which is either a plasma polymerized<br>
tetramethylsilane or a plasma polymerized tetramethylsilane<br>
and an oxidizing gas, preferentially oxygen or carbon<br>
dioxide, deposited on the surface on said polymer article,<br>
the x value being between 0 and 1.7, the y value being<br>
between 0.5 and 0.8, the z value being between 0.35 and 0.6<br>

-	a plasma treatment on said polymer article,<br>
advantageously an argon plasma treatment<br>
-	a deposition of a first coating of SiOxCyHz by<br>
generation of a plasma either from tetramethylsilane, or<br>
from tetramethylsilane and an oxidizing gas, preferentially<br>
oxygen or carbon dioxide, the x value being between 0 and<br>

magnetic guidance, or a plasma generating electrode, or<br>
both magnetic guidance and a plasma generating electrode.<br>
In one embodiment, power is loaded to the plasma<br>
using a frequency of 13.56 MHz.<br>
The ratio between oxygen and tetramethylsilane is<br>
between around zero and four so as to obtain said first<br>
coating, said ratio being between around four and ten so as<br>
to obtain said second coating onto said first one.<br>
In one aspect of the invention, the ratio between<br>
oxygen and tetramethylsilane is maintained during a first<br>
step of around one to four seconds at its first value of<br>
around zero to four, said ratio being maintained during a<br>
second step of around five to thirty seconds at its second<br>
value of around four to ten.<br>
Description of Preferred Embodiment<br>
A preferred embodiment of the invention will now be<br>
described with reference to the accompanying drawing, in<br>
which:<br><br>
11<br>
FIG. 1 shows apparatus for producing layers on an<br>
article.<br>
In one embodiment, a 3D polypropylene container of<br>
the type used for food is placed in a vacuum chamber thus<br>
defining an internal volume, the internal volume forming<br>
the reaction chamber for the plasma treatment. The term<br>
"plasma treatment" means the chemical decomposition of a<br>
gaseous compound by an electrical glow discharge under<br>
reduced atmosphere. Through a plasma treatment, it is<br>
obtained a layer or coating over the internal walls of the<br>
container in which the pressure has been reduced and the<br>
electrical glow discharge has taken place.<br>
The apparatus 1 for producing the coating according<br>
the invention comprises a support plate 2 overcoated by a<br>
radiofrequency faraday shield 3 having a radiofrequency<br>
electrode 5 supported by isolation means 6 provided on the<br>
support plate 2. The electrode 5 is cornected to a<br>
radiofrequencies generator 4, known as such.<br>
The electrode 5 has an internal shaped wall 7 on<br>
which the article to be coated 8 is placed. Advantageously,<br>
the internal shaped wall 7 has a complementary form of the<br>
form of article 8.<br>
The article to be coated 8 forms an internal<br>
volume 9 which is the reacting chamber in which gas from an<br>
inlet 10 is injected.<br>
Pumping means are also provided in order to reduce<br>
the pressure inside the internal volume through an aperture<br>
11 in the support plate 2.<br>
Pressure is gradually reduced inside the reaction<br>
chamber 9 to a value of around 0.01 mbar. Reaction gases<br>
are then introduced through the gas inlet 10 in the<br>
reaction chamber 9 until a pressure of about 0.1 mbar.<br>
Then an electrical glow discharge is applied<br><br>
12<br>
through the electrode 5 disposed around the container<br>
closely to its external surface so that the plasma is<br>
generated only on the inner surface of the container 8.<br>
First of all, argon plasma treatment is made on the<br>
inner surface of the 3D container. Preferentially, the<br>
argon plasma treatment is between . 1 and 20s, more<br>
preferentially between 5 and 10s.<br>
The argon plasma treatment increases the energy on<br>
the surface in order to obtain a better adherence on it of<br>
a plasma deposition.<br>
Then a first plasma deposit is made on the plasma<br>
treated inner surface of the container, using<br>
tetramethylsilane Si-(CH3)4 and oxygen 02 both injected at a<br>
given flow rate in said internal volume of the container<br>
forming the reaction chamber. Preferentially, power is<br>
loaded to the plasma by radiofrequency, the frequency being<br>
of 13.56 MHz. The ratio between oxygen and<br>
tetramethylsilane is between zero and three in the vacuum<br>
chaitiber and the treatment time is between one to four<br>
seconds.<br>
The tetramethylsilane has a saturation vapor<br>
pressure of around 900 mbar at ambient temperature and does<br>
not need to be added in a carrier gas in order to be moved<br>
from a storage place to the reacting chamber 9.<br>
Furthermore, it is not necessary to heat the gas<br>
during the process according to the invention, and more<br>
precisely during the moving between the storage place of<br>
the gas and the reacting chamber in order to avoid the<br>
condensation of the gas.<br>
The first deposit is a first SiOxCyH, layer (or<br>
coating) of a few nanometers thick, the thickness of said<br>
first SiOxCyHz coating is from .about 0.1 nanometer to about<br>
15 nanometers.<br><br>

Using a ratio of around two between oxygen and<br>
tetramethylsilane in said internal volume of the container<br>
forming the reaction chamber, i.e. using an oxygen flow<br>
rate twice as big as the tetramethylsilane flow rate, the<br>
chemical composition of this first SiOxCyH2 coating is the<br>
following:<br>
Si: 27.6%<br>
0: 43.6%<br>
C: 17.1%<br>
H: 11.7%<br>
Formula SiOxCyHz x being 1.58, y being 0.62 and z<br>
being 0.42.<br>
In order to determine the chemical composition of<br>
first and second coatings, Electron Spectroscopy for<br>
Chemical Analysis (ESCA), Infrared Transmission (FTIR) and<br>
Electron Recoil Detection (ERD) analyses have been used.<br>
A second plasma deposit is then made on the coated<br>
inner surface of the container, using tetramethylsilane and<br>
oxygen again. Power is again loaded by RF, same frequency<br>
being used. The ratio between oxygen and tetramethylsilane<br>
in said internal volume of the container forming the<br>
reaction chamber is maintained between four and ten, i.e.<br>
the oxygen flow rate in said internal volume is between<br>
four and ten times bigger than the tetramethylsilane flow<br>
rate in said internal volume and the treatment time is<br>
between five to thirty seconds. Preferentially, the ratio<br>
between oxygen and tetramethylsilane is between four and<br>
seven.<br>
To summarize, the ratio between oxygen and<br>
tetramethylsilane is between around zero and three so as to<br>
obtain said first coating and the ratio is between around<br>
four and ten so as to obtain said second coating onto said<br>
first one.<br><br>
14<br>
The second deposit is a SiOxCyHz layer (or coating)<br>
of a few nanometers thick. More precisely, the thickness of<br>
said second SiOxCyHz coating is from about 10 nanometers to<br>
about 100 nanometers, preferentially from 15 to 50<br>
nanometers, and more preferentially around 30 nanometers.<br>
Using' a ratio of around 4.5 between oxygen and<br>
tetramethylsilane in said internal volume of the container<br>
forming the reaction chamber, the chemical composition of<br>
this second SiOxCyH2 coating is the following (ESCA, FTIR<br>
and ERD analyses):<br>
Si: 28.5%<br>
&gt;OJ J5.0„J5.5£<br>
C: 12.55%<br>
H: 8.35%<br>
Formula SiOxCyH2 x being 1.77, y being 0.44 and z<br>
being 0.29<br>
Using a ratio of around 8.5 between oxygen and TMS,<br>
the chemical composition of this second SiOxCyHz coating is<br>
the following (ESCA, FTIR and ERD analyses) :<br>
Si: 28.75%<br>
0: 54.95%<br>
C: 8.9%<br>
H: 7.4%<br>
Formula SiOxCyHz x being 1.91, y being 0.31 and z<br>
being 0.257.<br>
After the second deposit of the second SiOxCyHz<br>
coating, the reduced atmosphere is increased to the ambient<br>
atmosphere.<br>
The present inventor has surprisingly discovered<br>
that the shaped article obtained has a very low tendency of<br>
being stained during its lifetime, this shaped article<br>
being washable in a dishwasher, and being also able to be<br>
placed in a refrigerator, a freezer or a microwave oven.<br><br>
15<br>
A number of 125 washings were made at 85°C using a<br>
detergent named Neodisher Alka 300 and a rinsing liquid<br>
agent named Neodisher TS, supplied by Dr Weigert Cie.<br>
In order to verify the anti-staining feature of the<br>
coating according to the present invention, bowls have been<br>
filled with different kind of aggressive alimentary sauces<br>
and coloring products and then stocked in an oven at 80°C<br>
during 24 hours.<br>
The tendency of being stained was visually observed<br>
before and after dishwashing.<br>
Very good results were obtained with the containers<br>
treated by the above described method, i. e. it has been<br>
visually noticed that the bowls with a coating according<br>
the invention are not stained by comparison with any other<br>
bowl.<br>
The applicant has also noticed that after<br>
dishwashing the surface of the coating becomes very<br>
hydrophilic.<br>
The applicant has also noticed that a too high<br>
ratio between oxygen and tetramethylsilane involves the<br>
formation of a SiOx-like coating, which is not wash-<br>
resistant after several washes in a dishwasher, especially<br>
at higher temperatures.<br>
The method for manufacturing a polymer article<br>
having a thin coating formed on at least one of its side by<br>
plasma according to the present invention comprises<br>
successively:<br>
a plasma treatment on said polymer article,<br>
advantageously an argon plasma treatment ;<br>
- a deposition of a first coating of SiOxCyHz by<br>
generation of a plasma from tetramethylsilane,<br>
preferentially in the presence of an oxidizing gas,<br>
preferentially oxygen 02 or carbon dioxyde, the x value<br><br>
16<br>
being between 0 and 1.7, the y value being between 0.5 and<br>
0.8, the z value being between 0.35 and 0.6 for said first<br>
SiOxCyHz coating, and<br>
-	a subsequent deposition of a second coating of<br>
SiOxCyHz by generation of a plasma from tetramethylsilane in<br>
the presence of an oxidizing gas, preferentially oxygen 02<br>
or carbon dioxide, the x value being between 1.7 and 1.99,<br>
the y value being between 0.2 and 0.7, the z value being<br>
between 0.2 and 0.35 for said second SiOxCyH2 coating, the<br>
thickness of said first coating being from about 1<br>
nanometer to about 15 nanometers and the thickness of said<br>
second coating being from about 10 nanometers to about 100<br>
nanometers, preferentially around 30 nanometers.<br>
Preferentially, the polymer article is configured<br>
in the form of a container, its inner side being plasma<br>
treated and coated.<br>
Furthermore, when the polymer article is an article<br>
having an internal volume, the method according the<br>
invention comprises before said step of plasma treatment on<br>
said polymer article, the following steps of:<br>
-	placing a polymer article in a vacuum chamber;<br>
-	decreasing the pressure in the vacuum chamber;<br>
-	decreasing the pressure in the internal volume of<br>
the polymer article;<br>
-	applying an electrical glow discharge through an<br>
electrode disposed around the container closely to its<br>
external surface.<br>
The applicant has surprisingly discovered that a<br>
first coating of SiOxCyH2 which is either a plasma<br>
polymerized tetramethylsilane or a plasma polymerized<br>
tetramethylsilane and an oxidizing gas, preferentially<br>
oxygen or carbon dioxide, deposited on the surface on a<br>
polymer article, with an x value between 0 and 1.7, an y<br><br>
17<br>
value between 0.5 and 0.8, and an z value between 0.35 and<br>
0.6 for said first SiOxCyHz coating is highly preferential<br>
and that a second coating of SiOxCyHz which is a plasma<br>
polymerized tetramethylsilane and an oxidizing gas,<br>
preferentially oxygen or carbon dioxide, deposited on the<br>
surface on the first coating, with an x value between 1.7<br>
and 1.99, an y value between 0.2 and 0.7, and an z value<br>
between 0.2 and 0.35 for said second SiOxCyHz coating is<br>
highly preferential.<br>
The polymer article may be in either polypropylene<br>
or polyethylene or polycarbonate or poly butyl<br>
teraphtalate.<br>
The coating according to the invention may be made<br>
using either magnetic guidance, or a plasma generating<br>
electrode, or both magnetic guidance and a plasma<br>
generating electrode.<br>
Preferentially, the polymer article is a 3D shaped<br>
one, this article being placed in a vacuum chamber and<br>
defining an internal volume and an external volume, the<br>
inner part of the article defining the internal volume as<br>
the reacting chamber, pressure inside said reacting chamber<br>
being around 0.01 mbar.<br>
The applicant has also noticed that that a method<br>
with an argon plasma treatment made on the inner surface of<br>
a 3D polyethylene container and a plasma deposition of one<br>
coating made on the inner surface using tetramethysilane<br>
and oxygen also results in the formation of a container<br>
having very low tendency of being stained during its<br>
lifetime and being washable in a dishwasher and able to be<br>
placed in a refrigerator, a freezer or a microwave oven.<br>
The ratio between oxygen and tetramethylsilane in<br>
the internal volume of the container forming the reaction<br>
chamber is maintained between four and ten, i.e. the oxygen<br><br>
18<br>
flow rate in said internal volume is between four and ten<br>
times bigger than the tetramethylsilane flow rate in said<br>
internal volume and the treatment time is between five to<br>
thirty seconds. Preferentially, the ratio between oxygen<br>
and tetramethylsilane is between four and seven.<br>
The layer is a SiOxCyHz layer (or coating) of a few<br>
nanometers thick. More precisely, the thickness of said<br>
SiOxCyHz coating is from about 10 nanometers to about 100<br>
nanometers, preferentially from 15 to 50 nanometers, and<br>
more preferentially around 30 nanometers.<br>
Nevertheless, a method with a first S.!0xCyH2 coating<br>
and a second SiOxCyHz coating is highly preferential and<br>
results in a polymer article with improved features (wash<br>
resistance, transparency, etc.).<br><br>
