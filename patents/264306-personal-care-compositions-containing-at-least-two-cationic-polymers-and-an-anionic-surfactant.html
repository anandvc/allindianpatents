				<td>PERSONAL CARE COMPOSITIONS CONTAINING AT LEAST TWO CATIONIC POLYMERS AND AN ANIONIC SURFACTANT<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to conditioning personal care compositions with improved conditioning performance which comprise select cationic polymers.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Conditioning personal care compositions comprising various combinations of detersive surfactant and hair conditioning agents are known. These personal care products typically comprise an anionic detersive surfactant in combination with a conditioning agent such as silicone, hydrocarbon oil, fatty esters, or combinations thereof. These personal care compositions have become more popular among consumers as a means of conveniently obtaining hair conditioning and hair cleansing performance all from a single hair care product.<br>
Many personal care compositions, however, do not provide sufficient deposition of conditioning agents onto hair or skin during application. Obtaining good deposition of a conditioning agent onto hair is complicated by the action of detersive surfactants in the personal care composition. Detersive surfactants are designed to carry away or remove, oil, grease, dirt, and particulate matter from the hair and scalp. In doing so, the detersive surfactants can also interfere with deposition of the conditioning agent, and carry away both deposited and non deposited conditioning agent during rinsing. This reduces deposition of the conditioning agent onto the hair after rinsing, thus reducing hair conditioning performance. Without sufficient deposition of the conditioning agent on the hair, relatively high levels of conditioning agents may be needed in the personal care composition to provide adequate hair conditioning performance. Such high levels of a conditioning agent, however, can increase raw material costs, reduce lathering, and present product stability concerns.<br>
One known method for improving deposition of a hair conditioning agent onto hair involves the use of certain cationic polymers. Such cationic polymers may form coacervate phases which aid deposition of conditioning agents and provide good wet hair conditioning benefits such as wet hair feel, detangling, and wet combing ease.<br>
One class of cationic polymers comprises high charge density polymers which form a lyotropic liquid crystal coacervate in the presence of an anionic surfactant. Such polymers are characterized by excellent wet combing benefits when used in shampoo compositions, even in<br>
the absence of secondary conditioning agents. When conditioning agents are used, liquid crystal coacervates aid in deposition of large particle size silicone to skin and hair. However, liquid crystal forming polymers do not provide an extended soft wet conditioning and feel throughout the rinse process-as would be expected by a consumer from a desirable conditioning shampoo.<br>
Another class of cationic polymers comprises low charge density cationic polymers which form isotropic coacervates upon dilution of the personal care composition with water. They are often characterized by their favorable wet conditioning and feel, even in the absence of conditioning agents. When conditioning agents are used, isotropic coacervates have been found to aid deposition of small particle size silicone, to skin and hair. However, such low charge density cationic polymers lack the level of wet combing benefit delivered by lyotropic liquid crystal coacervate forming cationic polymers.<br>
Furthermore, formulation of compositions comprising both lyotropic liquid crystal coacervate and isotropic coacervate has been, thus far, unsuccessful. Previous attempts to formulate such compositions have resulted in the destruction of one, or both, of the coacervate phases upon combination.<br>
Based on the foregoing, there still exists a need for a personal care composition with both<br>
excellent wet conditioning and wet combing benefits.	<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION <br>
The present invention relates to a personal care composition comprising:<br>
a.	from about 5% to about 50% by weight of an anionic detersive surfactant;<br>
b.	from about 0.025% to about 5% by weight of a first cationic polymer having a<br>
cationic charge density of less than about 4 meq/gm, wherein said first cationic<br>
polymer forms an isotropic coacervate;<br>
c.	from about 0.025% to about 5% by weight of a second cationic polymer having a<br>
cationic charge density of greater than or equal to about 4 meq/gm, wherein said<br>
second cationic polymer forms a lyotropic liquid crystal coacervate; and<br>
d.	from about 20% to about 94% by weight of water,<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
 The personal care compositions of the present invention can comprise, consist of, or consist essentially of the essential elements and limitations of the invention described herein, as well any of the additional or optional ingredients, components, or limitations described herein.<br>
It has been surprisingly discovered that by combining low charge density cationic polymers which form isotropic coacervates with higher charge density cationic polymers, which combine with an anionic surfactant to form lyotropic liquid crystals in a personal care composition, provides both excellent wet hair feel and excellent wet combing benefits.<br>
Furthermore, it has been discovered that in order for the lyotropic liquid crystal coacervate and isotropic coacervates to coexist in a personal care composition the high charge density liquid crystal forming polymer must be premixed with an anionic surfactant prior to the addition of the low charge density isotropic coacervate forming polymer. A detailed description of the formulation process is described herein.<br>
Moreover, without being limited to a particular theory, it appears that when dispersed conditioning agent particles are added to the matrix, the concentrated polymer lyotropic liquid crystal phase and isotropic coacervate phase provide an improved mechanism for conditioning agent deposition, resulting in an overall conditioning benefit.<br>
The liquid crystalline state exists structurally between the solid crystalline phase and the liquid phase (i.e. an intermediate between the three dimensionally ordered crystalline state and the completely disordered liquid state).<br>
In one embodiment, the personal cleansing compositions include an anionic surfactant, a cationic polymer having a cationic charge density of less than about 4 meq/gm, a cationic polymer having a cationic charge density of greater than or equal to about 4 meq/gm, and water. Each of these components, as well as other preferred or optional components are described in detail hereinafter.<br>
All percentages, parts and ratios are based upon the total weight of the compositions of the present invention, unless otherwise specified. All such weights as they pertain to listed ingredients are based on the active level and, therefore, do not include solvents or by-products that may be included in commercially available materials, unless otherwise specified.<br>
All molecular weights as used herein are weight average molecular weights expressed as grams/mole, unless otherwise specified.<br>
The term "amphiphilic" as used herein, refers to complexes having both hydrophilic and<br>
hydrophobic properties.	<br>
The term "isotropic" as used herein, means a particular phase structure of coacervate wherein the structure is'[random or disordered] along any three orthogonal directions in space, and is therefore dark or 'nonbirefringenf when viewed between crossed polarized light.   (One<br>
direction is 'orthogonal to another if the vector component of the first, in the direction of the second, is zero.)'(Laughlin, R. G. (1994) The Aqueous Phase Behavior of Surfactants, 182, 8.2).<br>
The term "liquid crystal'as used herein, means a material having phases mat are ordered and/or crystalline in only one or two of their three possible orthogonal directions and are disordered (random and/or liquid-like ) in the other dimensions.<br>
The term "lyotropic" as used herein, means that the ordering effects of a material are<br>
induced by changing both its concentration and temperature. Lyotropic liquid crystals are in the<br>
class of amphiphilic materials.	,<br>
The term "neat'as used herein, means the unadulterated form of the present composition (i.e. prior to altering of the composition through dilution with water).<br>
The term, "nonvolatile" refers to any material having little or no significant vapor pressure under ambient conditions, and a boiling point under one atmosphere (atm) preferably at least about 250°C. The vapor pressure under such conditions is preferably less than about 0.2 mm.<br>
The term "water soluble" as used herein, means that the polymer is soluble in water in the present composition. In general, the polymer should be soluble at 25°C at a concentration of 0.1% by weight of the water solvent, preferably at 1%, more preferably at 5%, more preferably at 15%.<br>

The anionic detersive surfactant component in turn comprises anionic detersive surfactant, zwitterionic or amphoteric detersive surfactant which has an attached group that is anionic at the pH of the composition, or a combination thereof, preferably anionic detersive surfactant. Such surfactants should be physically and chemically compatible with the essential components described herein, or should not otherwise unduly impair product stability, aesthetics or performance.<br>
Suitable anionic detersive surfactant components include those which are known for use in hair care or other personal care cleansing compositions. The concentration of the anionic surfactant component in the personal care composition should be sufficient to provide the desired cleaning and lather performance, and generally range from about 5% to about 50%, preferably from about 8% to about 30%, more preferably from about 10% to about 25%, even more preferably from about 12% to about 20%, by weight of the composition.<br>

The personal care compositions may further comprise additional surfactants for use in<br>
» combination with the anionic detersive surfactant component described hereinbefore.   Suitable<br>
optional surfactants include nonionic surfactants, cationic surfactants, and combinations thereof.<br>
Any such surfactant known in the art for use in hair or personal care products may be used,<br>
provided that the optional additional surfactant is also chemically and physically compatible with<br>
the essential components of the personal care composition, or does not otherwise unduly impair<br>
product performance, aesthetics or stability.      The concentration of the optional additional<br>
surfactants in the personal care composition may vary with the cleansing or lather performance<br>
desired, the optional surfactant selected, the desired product concentration, the presence of other<br>
components in the composition, and other factors well known in the art.<br>
Non limiting examples of other anionic, zwitterionic, amphoteric or optional additional<br>
surfactants suitable for use in the personal care compositions are described in McCutcheon's,<br>
Emulsifiers and Detergents, 1989 Annual, published by M. C. Publishing Co.,  and U.S. Patent<br>
Nos. 3,929,678; 2,658,072; 2,438,091; and 2,528,378.<br>
Naturally Derived Cationic Polymer<br>
The personal care compositions of the present invention comprise a first cationic polymer which is a low charge density cationic polymer. In a preferred embodiment, the first cationic polymer is a naturally derived cationic polymer. The term, "naturally derived cationic polymer' as used herein, refers to cationic polymers which are obtained from natural sources. The natural sources may be polysaccharide polymers. Therefore, the naturally derived cationic polymer may be selected from celluloses, starches, guars, non-guar-galactomannans, and other sources found in nature.<br>
The first cationic polymer has a molecular weight of from about 1,000 to about 10,000,000, and a cationic charge density of at least about 0.2 meq/g, more preferably at least about 0.5 meq/g. The first cationic polymer also has a charge density of less than about 4.0 meq/gm, and more preferably less than or equal to about 2 meq/gm. The polymers are typically present in a concentration of from about 0.025% to about 5%, and more preferably from about 0.10% to about 2% by weight of the personal care composition. The first cationic polymers form an isotropic coacervate in the neat composition or upon dilution with water. The isotropic coacervate aids in deposition of optional small particle size conditioning agents, and provides excellent wet conditioning performance. Such deposition and wet conditioning enhancement result in hair feel, shine, and other appreciable benefits.<br>
The cationic polymers herein are either soluble in the personal care composition, or are soluble in a complex coacervate phase in the personal care composition formed by the cationic polymer and the anionic detersive surfactant component described hereinbefore. Complex coacervates of the cationic polymer can also be formed with other charged materials, such as anionic polymers, in the personal care composition.<br>
Isotropic coacervate formation is dependent upon a variety of criteria such as molecular weight, component concentration, and ratio of interacting ionic components, ionic strength (including modification of ionic strength, for example, by addition of salts), charge density of the cationic and anionic components, pH, temperature, and the aforementioned surfactant system. Isotropic coacervate systems and the effect of these parameters have been described, for example, by J. Caelles, et al., "Anionic and Cationic Compounds in Mixed Systems", Cosmetics &amp; Toiletries, Vol. 106, April 1991, pp 49-54, C. J. van Oss, "Coacervation, Complex Coacervation and Hocculation", J. Dispersion Science and Technology, Vol. 9 (5,6), 1988-89, pp 561-573, and<br>
D. J. Burgess, "Practical Analysis of Complex Coacervate Systems", J. of Colloid and Interface Science, Vol. 140, No. 1, November 1990, pp 227-238.<br>
It is believed to be particularly advantageous for the first cationic polymer to be present in the personal care composition in an isotropic coacervate phase, or to form an isotropic coacervate phase upon application or rinsing of the composition to or from the hair. Complex isotropic coacervates are believed to more readily deposit on the hair than a dissolved polymer. Thus, in general, it is preferred that the first cationic polymer exist in the personal care composition as an isotropic coacervate phase or form an isotropic coacervate phase upon dilution.<br>
Techniques for analysis of formation of complex isotropic coacervates are known in the<br>
art. For example, microscopic analyses of the personal care compositions, at any chosen stage of<br>
dilution, can be utilized to identify whether an isotropic coacervate phase has formed.   Such<br>
t isotropic coacervate phases will be identifiable as an additional emulsified phase in the<br>
composition. The use of dyes can aid in distinguishing the isotropic coacervate phase from other<br>
insoluble phases dispersed in the personal care composition.<br>
Cationic Polysaccharide Polymers<br>
The personal care compositions of the present invention may include a naturally derived cationic polymer which is a cationic polysaccharide polymer. Cationic polysaccharide polymers encompass cellulose polymers, starch polymers, and polymers made up of multiple monosaccharides joined together by glycosidic linkages.<br>
Suitable polysaccharide cationic polymers include those which conform to the following formula:<br>
(FORMULA REMOVED)<br>
wherein A is an anhydroglucose residual group, such as a cellulose anhydroglucose residual; R is an alkylene oxyalkylene, polyoxyalkylene, or hydroxyalkylene group, or combination thereof; Rl, R2, and R3 independently are alkyl, aryl, alkyl aryl, aryl alkyl, alkoxyalkyl, or alkoxyaryl groups, each group containing up to about 18 carbon atoms, and the total No of carbon atoms for each cationic moiety (i.e., the sum of carbon atoms in Rl, R2 and R3) preferably being about 20 or less; and X is an anionic counterion. Non-limiting examples of such counterions include halides (e.g., chlorine, fluorine, bromine, iodine), sulfate and methylsulfate. The degree of cationic substitution in these polysaccharide polymers is typically from about 0.01 to about 1 cationic groups per anhydroglucose unit.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, the cellulose cationic polymers are salts of hydroxyethyl cellulose reacted with trimethyl ammonium substituted epoxide, referred to in the industry (CTFA) as Polyquaternium 10 and available from Amerchol Corp. (Edison, N.J., USA) under the trade name, Ucare Polymer KG-30M, having a cationic charge density of about 1.9 meq/gm.<br>
Cationically Modified Starch Polymer<br>
The personal care compositions may comprise a naturally derived cationic polymer which is a water-soluble cationically modified starch polymer. As used herein, the term, "cationically modified starch', refers to a starch to which a cationic group is added prior to degradation of the starch to a smaller molecular weight, or wherein a cationic group is added after modification of the starch to achieve a desired molecular weight. The definition of the term'tationically modified starch' also includes amphoterically modified starches having a, net positive charge. The term 'knphoterically modified starcH' refers to a starch hydrolysate to which a cationic group and an anionic group are added.<br>
A method of chemically modifying the charge densities of the cationically modified<br>
starch polymers includes, but is not limited to, the addition of amino and/or ammonium groups<br>
into the starch molecules. Non-limiting examples of these ammonium groups may include<br>
substituents such as hydroxypropyl trimmonium chloride, trimethylhydroxypropyl ammonium<br>
chloride,	dimethylstearylhydroxypropyl	ammonium	chloride,	and<br>
dimethyldodecylhydroxypropyl ammonium chloride. See Solarek, D. B., Cationic Starches in Modified Starches: Properties and Uses, Wurzburg, O.B., Ed., CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, Florida 1986, pp 113-125. The cationic groups may be added to the starch prior to degradation to a smaller molecular weight or the cationic groups may be added after such modification.<br>
The cationically modified starch polymers may comprise maltodextrin. Thus, in one embodiment of the present invention, the cationically modified starch polymers may be further characterized by a Dextrose Equivalance CDE) value of less than about 35, and more preferably from about 1 to about 20. The DE value is a measure of the reducing equivalence of the hydrolyzed starch referenced to dextrose and expressed as a percent (on dry basis). Starch completely hydrolyzed to dextrose has a DE value of 100, and unhydrolyzed starch has a DE value of 0. A suitable assay for DE value includes one described in 'Dextrose Equivalent', Standard Analytical Methods of the Member Companies of the Corn Industries Research Foundation, 1st ed., Method E-26.  Additionally, the cationically modified starch polymers may<br>
comprise a dextrin.   Dextrin is typically a pyrolysis product of starch with a wide range of<br>
molecular weights.<br>
t The source of starch before chemical modification can be chosen from a variety of<br>
sources such as tubers, legumes, cereal, and grains. Non-limiting examples of this source starch<br>
may include corn starch, wheat starch, rice starch, waxy corn starch, oat starch, cassava starch,<br>
waxy barley, waxy rice starch, glutenous rice starch, sweet rice starch, amioca, potato starch,<br>
tapioca starch, oat starch, sago starch, sweet rice, or mixtures thereof.   Waxy corn starch is<br>
preferred.<br>
In one embodiment of the present invention, cationically modified starch polymers are selected from degraded cationic maize starch, cationic tapioca, cationic potato starch, and mixtures thereof. In another embodiment, cationically modified starch polymers are cationic corn starch.<br>
The starch, prior to degradation or after modification to a smaller molecular weight, may comprise one or more additional modifications. For example, these modifications may include cross-linking, stabilization reactions, phophorylations, and hydrolyzations. Stabilization reactions may include alkylation and esterification.<br>
The cationically modified starch polymers in the present invention may be incorporated into the composition in the form of hydrolyzed starch (e.g., acid, enzyme, or alkaline degradation), oxidized starch (e.g., peroxide, peracid, hypochlorite, alkaline, or any other oxidizing agent), physically/mechanically degraded starch (e.g., via the thermo-mechanical energy input of the processing equipment), or combinations thereof.<br>
Suitable cationically modified starches are available from known starch suppliers, such as National Starch. Also suitable for use in the present invention is nonionic modified starch that could be futher derivatized to a cationically modified starch as is known in the art. Other suitable modified starch starting materials may be quaternized, as is known in the art, to produce a cationically modified starch polymer suitable for use in the present invention.<br>
One method of conducting starch degradation involves preparing a starch slurry by mixing granular starch in water. The temperature is raised to about 35°C. An aqueous solution of potassium permanganate is then added at a concentration of about 50 ppm based on starch. The pH is raised to about 11.5 with sodium hydroxide and the slurry is stirred sufficiently to prevent settling of the starch. Then, about a 30% solution of hydrogen peroxide diluted in water is added to a level of about 1% of peroxide based on starch. The pH of about 11.5 is then restored by adding additional sodium hydroxide.   The reaction is completed over about a 1 to<br>
about 20 hour period.   The mixture is then neutralized with dilute hydrochloric acid.   The degraded starch is recovered by filtration followed by washing and drying.<br>
Cationic Galactomannan Polymer<br>
The personal care compositions may comprise a naturally derived cationic polymer which may be a guar or non-guar galactomannan polymer. In one embodiment, the galactomannan polymer is a polymer derivative having a mannose to galactose ratio of 2 : 1 or greater, on a monomer to monomer basis, and the galactomannan polymer derivative is selected from the group consisting of a cationic galactomannan polymer derivative and an amphoteric galactomannan polymer derivative having a net positive charge. The term "galactomannan polymer derivative", means a compound obtained from a galactomannan polymer (ie. a galactomannan gum) which, is chemically modified. As used herein, the term "cationic galactomannari' refers to a galactomannan polymer to which a cationic group is added. The term 'Amphoteric galactomannari'refers to a galactomannan polymer to which a cationic group and an anionic group are added such that the polymer has a net positive charge.<br>
Galactomannan polymers are present in the endosperm of seeds of the leguminosae family. Galactomannan polymers are made up of a combination of mannose monomers and galactose monomers. The galactomannan molecule is a straight chain mannan branched at regular intervals with single membered galactose units on specific mannose units. The mannose units are linked to each other by means of (i (1-4) glycosidic linkages. The galactose branching arises by way of an u (1-6) linkage. The ratio of mannose monomers to galactose monomers varies according to the species of the plant and also is affected by climate. Guar is an example of one type of a galactomannan polymer, specifically having a mannose to galactose ratio of 2 monomers of mannose to 1 monomer of galactose. In one embodiment, the galactomannan polymer derivatives have a ratio of mannose to galactose of greater than 2 : 1 on a monomer to monomer basis (i.e., non-guar galactomannan polymers). Preferably, the ratio of mannose to galactose is greater than about 3:1, and more preferably the ratio of mannose to galactose is greater than about 4:1. Analysis of mannose to galactose ratios is well known in the art and is typically based on the measurement of the galactose content.<br>
The gum for use in preparing the non-guar galactomannan polymer derivatives is typically obtained as naturally occurring material such as seeds or beans from plants. Examples of various non-guar galactomannan polymers include but are not limited to tara gum (3 parts mannose / 1 part galactose), locust bean or carob (4 parts mannose /1 part galactose), and cassia<br>
gum (5 parts mannose / 1 part galactose). Herein, the term "non-guar galactomannan polymer<br>

Method of Making<br>
All exemplified amounts are listed as weight percents and exclude minor materials such as diluents, preservatives, color solutions, imagery or conceptual ingredients, botanicals, and so forth, unless otherwise specified.<br>
One method of making the present compositions involves mixing water and cocamide, which are heated to above 55°C in the main mix tank. A polymeric anionic thickener, such as acrylates copolymer may optionally be added. Acrylates copolymer, which is commercially sold under the trade name, Aqua SFl, is available from National Starch and other commercial suppliers. Surfactants are then added and the pH is raised to &gt;6.5 in order to activate thickening of the acrylates copolymer. Next, the synthetic cationic polymer is mixed, in a concentrated salt solution, with an anionic surfactant to form a liquid crystal coacervate in a premix. This premix is then added to the main mix tank. Then naturally derived cationic polymer is added to the main mix tank. Alternately, the naturally derived cationic polymer may be added to the main mix tank, followed by the aforementioned premix. It has been discovered that if the naturally derived cationic polymer is added to the main mix tank before the synthetic cationic polymer, then liquid crystal coacervate formation is inhibited, unless the synthetic cationic polymer is subsequently added to the main mix tank in the form of the aforementioned premix. Glycol distearate can be crystallized in a separate surfactant premix and then added to the main mix. A silicone/surfactant premix can be made to achieve the desired particle size and then added to the main mix tank. The pH is finally adjusted to the desired level and preservatives and minors added.<br>
If acrylates copolymer is not used then the step of increasing the pH to &gt; 6.5 is not needed.<br>
If a multiple phase shampoo is formulated, the multiple phases are made separately and then added separately to the package to achieve the desired appearance. The multiple phases may differ in color, composition, texture, transparency or mixtures of these attributes. Multiple phase personal care compositions are described in detail in U.S. Patent No. 3,932,610.<br>
The following examples are representative of shampoo compositions of the invention. The present compositions may comprise one, two, or more phases in accordance with the examples below:<br>
