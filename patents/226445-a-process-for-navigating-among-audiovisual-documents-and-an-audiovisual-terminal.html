				<td>The invention relates :;o a process for<br>
navigating among multimedia documents accessible with<br>
the help of a multimedia terminal with the help of a<br>
user interface "and to a multimedia terminal for<br>
implementing the process. The invention applies in<br>
particular in the case where descriptive data<br>
pertaining to the multimedia documents are available.<br>
A user interface uses these descriptive data to<br>
formulate menus which can be displayed on the screen of<br>
the television, thus enabling the user to choose the<br>
multimedia documents. Patent application FR96/09679<br>
filed by the applicant describes a process for<br>
selecting television programmes and a device<br>
incorporating a graphics interface enabling the user to<br>
navigate through lists of programmes. The menus enable<br>
the user to ascertain the general content of an audio-<br>
visual transmission and thus to select the latter<br>
according to his tastes. The descriptive data, called<br>
service information" in the standard relating to<br>
DVB-SI, are stored in a local database and constantly<br>
aipdatecl as a function of the documents accessible on<br>
the network. The elements of the data base are grouped<br>
together according to certain criteria contained in the<br>
service information, such as: topic, language, rating<br>
evel, etc.<br>
However, these user interfaces are static<br>
navigation interfaces, in the sense that the hierarchy<br>
of the elements through which one is navigating remains<br>
constant throughout their use, even during their entire<br>
life cycle. In general, the hierarchy of the elements<br>
oisplayed by a static user interface is designed and<br>
fixed at the time of its design, once and for all. To<br>
access the same elements, such as the control<br>
functions, the TV programmes, etc., the user always<br>
navigates through the same menus, the same dialogues,<br>
etc., doing so in the same order.<br>
An improvement to static user interfaces is the<br>
configurable user interface. Patents US5,694,176<br>
(MARTZ) published on 2 December 1997 and<br><br>
EP 623 870 (IBM) published on 9 November 1994 present<br>
interfaces for navigating through a structure<br>
According to this prior art, the user selects<br>
attributes for each level of the structure and thus to<br>
filter the multimedia documents according to the<br>
attributes selected. However these interfaces, although<br>
configurable, remain static and do not allow the<br>
organisation of thelevels of the navigation structure<br>
to be adapted to the tastes of the user.<br>
The introduction of digital, network has seen<br>
the appearance of mass storage means, digital TV-<br>
decoders also permitting access to Internet type<br>
networks in homes. Tomorrow's user will be faced with a<br>
very considerable quantity of multimedia documents of<br>
various types, such as audio, videos, pictures, text,<br>
application/services, etc. User interfaces must hence<br>
forth enable the user to navigate through such<br>
maltimedia databases and to find the documents that the<br>
user " desires, and to do so in an effective and<br>
user-friendly manner.<br>
The invention proposes a new dynamic user<br>
navigation interface concept which offers navigation<br>
and more effective and user-friendly possibilities of<br>
searching for multimedia documents.<br>
The subject of the invention is a process for<br>
ravigating and for selecting multimedia documents in a<br>
terminal equipped with a display device and comprising<br>
a step of receiving descriptive document data, the said<br>
descriptive data comprising classification elements for<br>
indexing the documents into document categories, the<br>
process is characterised in that it comprises the<br>
tollowirg steps:<br>
- displaying of a first navigation tree structure<br>
with identification of a current level in the tree, the<br>
said tree structure comprising an ordered list of<br>
levels corresponding to indexing categories and for<br>
each level, a set of classification elements,<br>
instigating of a command for modification by<br>
the user of the tree structure displayed,<br><br>
in response to the command, construction of a<br>
second tree structure comprising a new ordered list of<br>
levels, and displaying of the new navigation • tree<br>
structure.<br>
In this way, the process makes it possible to<br>
formulate a new navigation structure for each command<br>
performed by the user. This navigation structure is<br>
called the "navigation tree". The user navigation<br>
interface displays on the screen the hierarchy of the<br>
elements of the tree and a selection of documents which<br>
is better suited to the user's preferences.<br>
According to an improvement, the user can,<br>
independently, modify the hierarchy of the levels of<br>
the navigation tree and the list of classification<br>
elements associated with each level.<br>
According to another improvement, the new<br>
dynamic user interface makes it possible to navigate<br>
through the newly formulated navigation tree. Another<br>
improvement consists in that during navigation, the new<br>
user interface dynamically and constantly displays the<br>
multimedia documents associated with the current level<br>
of the navigation tree. Specifically, a navigation<br>
command constitutes a request to search for the<br>
documents corresponding to the current position in the<br>
tree.<br>
The subject of the invention is also a<br>
multimedia terminal comprising a central unit, a means<br>
of receiving multimedia documents and "descriptive data,<br>
r. means of transmitting .data intended for display, the<br>
said descriptive data comprising classification<br>
elements for indexing the documents according to<br>
categories, and a means of activating the said<br>
cocuments, characterised in that it comprises a means<br>
of displaying a first structure of navigation tree<br>
stored in the terminal,, the said tree structure<br>
comprising an ordered list of levels corresponding to<br>
indexing categories and for each level, a set of<br>
classification elements, and a command for modifying<br>
t 'ie structure of the tree consisting in modifying the<br><br>
ordered list of levels, the command automatically<br>
triggering the display means for rhe updating of the<br>
structure displayed.<br>
Other characteristics and advantages of the<br>
invention will become apparent through the description<br>
of a particular exemplary embodiment described with<br>

The manner ogf-" operation of a multimedia<br>
terminal (1) equipped with a display device (2) will<br>
firstly be described. The terminal comprises a central<br>
unit (3) linked to a program memory (4), and an<br>
interface (5) for communication with a "high bit rate<br>
digital network (6) making it possible to transmit<br><br>
audio/video data in real time. This network is for<br>
example an IEEE 1394 network. The terminal furthermore"<br>
comprises an infrared singnal receiver (7) for<br>
receiving the signals from a remote control (8), a<br>
memory (9) for storing a database, and audio/video<br>
decoding logic (10) for creating audio-visual signals<br>
sent to the television screen (2) . The remote control<br>
is furnished with navigation buttons ↑,↓,→ and ← and<br>
buttons: "OK", "Insert", "Move" and "Delete" of its<br>
remote control.<br>
The terminal also comprises a circuit 11 for<br>
displaying data on the screen, often called the OSD<br>
circuit, the initials standing for "On Screen Display".<br>
The CSD circuit (11) is a text and graphics generator<br>
which enables menus and pictograms (for example, a<br>
number corresponding to the station displayed) to be<br>
displayed on the screen and which enables the<br>
navigation menus in accordance with the present<br>
invention to be displayed. The OSD circuit receives<br>
information from the Central Unit and from the GIUD<br>
module; (12) . The GIUD is advantageously made in the<br>
form of a programme module recorded in a read only<br>
memory.<br>
The digital bus (6) sends the terminal data<br>
comprising multimedia documents and descriptive data<br>
pertaining to these documents. The descriptive data<br>
comprise the attributes of the multimedia documents<br>
accessible by the digital bus. They are stored in the<br>
database of the memory (9) of the terminal and are<br>
continually updated during new receptions. The GIUD<br>
module then extracts the information from this database<br>
and processes this information so as to produce the<br>
navigation menus displayed on the screen and proposed<br>
to the user.<br>
In the example which follows, the multimedia<br>
documents are indexed according to six categories. The<br>
six categories and associated classification elements<br>
are as follows:<br><br>
- Language: English, French, German, Italian,<br>
Arabic, others<br>
Topic: film, information, documentary, sport,<br>
game/show.<br>
second level of topic: subtopic:<br>
•	film: {adventure, drama, erotic, detective<br>
story, fiction, others}<br>
•	information: {news, radio, weather forecast,<br>
stock market, sport, other}<br>
•	documentary: {general, nature, culture, social,<br>
history}<br>
•	game/show: {general, variety, circus, talk show,<br>
circus, theatre}<br>
•	sport: {general, football, tennis, basketball,<br>
athletics, water sports}<br><br>
Source: TPS, Satellite Channel, DVD room, video<br>
recorder, Web.<br>
Period (time of availability) : Monday, ...,<br>
Sunday, this morning, this afternoon, this<br>
evening,<br>
Rating: 0 (any audience), 1, ...., 3<br>
(pornographic).<br>
- Medium: audio, video, picture, text.<br>
It was stated earlier that the attributes give<br>
classification information pertaining to the multimedia<br>
documents. These attributes contain one or more values<br>
for each of the six categories. Here, for example, the<br>
Classification values associated with the attributes of<br>
the cartoon "Peter Pan":<br>
Medium: video.<br>
Period: Wednesday, Saturday, this evening.<br>
Rating: 0 (any audience).<br>
Topic: film/others.<br>
Language: French.<br>
Source: Satellite Channel.<br>
Of course, other documents referenced with the<br>
same attribute values may be found. It will be observed<br><br>
that one and the same document may possess several<br>
values for one and the same attribute, this document<br>
then belonging to several classification groups. For<br>
example, this cartoon appears in the documents<br>
accessible on Wednesday, Saturday and also this<br>
evening.<br>
According to the present invention, the user<br>
defines the navigation tree structure by ordering the<br>
categories according to his preferences. When the<br>
terminal is switched on for the first time, it contains<br>
no user-defined search filter. The GIUD module defines<br>
a document request and a default structure. The first<br>
navigation structure which is formulated by the GIUD<br>
module can also take into account the profile of the<br>
user, the ordered list of levels comprising first the<br>
user's preferred levels. The GIUD module constructs a<br>
first navigation tree and proposes it to the user. The<br>
user can in this way navigate as soon as the terminal<br>
is brought into service, through this first navigation<br>
tree. Subsequently, the user modifies the request<br>
and/or the navigation tree structure. Subsequently, the<br>
GIUD module constructs a new navigation tree according<br>
to the search filter defined by the user, and displays<br>
menus in accordance with this latest navigation tree.<br>
The navigation tree comprises at least six levels<br>
corresponding to the six categories described earlier.<br>
Figure 2 presents an example of a menu enabling<br>
the user to navigate through the navigation tree by way<br>
of a menu. This menu appears on the screen when the<br>
GIUD module is instigated. It comprises three columns:<br>
• The first column (on the left), the so-called<br>
"Filtering Column", shows the various levels of the<br>
navigation tree in the form of rectangular icons. The<br>
name of the category is displayed at the centre of the<br>
icon. The first level which is Located at the top of<br>
the column corresponds to the level situated<br>
immediately under the root of the tree. The levels<br>
follow one another underneath in the order of the<br>
navigation tree. This first column makes it possible to<br><br>
modify the request for documents and the structure of<br>
the navigation tree. It also makes it possible to<br>
signal the current level of the navigation through the<br>
tree.<br>
The secod (in the middle), the so-called<br>
"Navigation Column", is used for navigation through the<br>
tree constructed according to the search filter defined<br>
by the user in the filtering column. This second column<br>
makes it possible to display the classification<br>
elements associated with a level of the tree so that<br>
•the user can select one according to his preferences.<br>
• The third (on the right), the so-called<br>
Documents Column", shows the multimedia documents<br>
accessiole from the current level displayed in the<br>
filtering column, and which have as attributes the<br>
classification element selected in the navigation<br>
column.<br>
On instigating the GIUD module, the navigation<br>
column is the selected column. Each column contains a<br>
selected element whicn becomes the current element if<br>
the user selects its column. An element which was<br>
previously selected before a change of column will<br>
become reselected when its column is selected again.<br>
The selected column and the selected element,<br>
are visually highlighted with respect to the others,<br>
for example by a thicker framing, another colour, bold<br>
or fatter characters, and/or a particular background<br>
tint for the framing, ... etc. Likewise, the pre-selected<br>
eleirents are also graphically highlighted.<br>
The user changes column with the help of the ←<br>
and → buttons of the remote control; within the<br>
selected column, the user selects the elements with the<br>
help of the ↑ and ↓ buttons of the remote control.<br>
In the example of the menu of Figure 2, the<br>
navigation column is the selected column. In this<br>
column, TPS is the active element. The construction<br>
rule used for the navigation tree contains the<br>
ateegaries ordered in this way:<br>
1° Source<br><br>
2°	Topic<br>
3°	Period<br>
4°	Rating<br>
5°	Language<br>
6°	Medium<br>
Figure 3 presents the menu displayed by the<br>
GIUD module when the filtering column is selected,<br>
following the pressing of the ← button from the state<br>
presented in Figure 2. In this menu, the user can<br>
modify the navigation tree by formulating new search<br>
filters. To do this he uses the buttons of the remote<br>
control. In this menu, the ↑,↓ → and ← navigation<br>
buttons, the "Delete", "Move", "Insert", "OK" buttons<br>
are operational.<br>
When a category used in the navigation tree<br>
construction rule is selected, an action by the user on<br>
the "Delete" button excludes the category from the<br>
navigation tree structure. Therefore, the icon of this<br>
category is put right at the bottom of the filtering<br>
column and is visually marked out. Henceforth, this<br>
icon can no longer be accessible when the navigation<br>
column is selected (navigation menu). In the example of<br>
Figure 3, it is surrounded by dots. The active element<br>
is the one which was immediately underneath the one<br>
which has just been deleted. To incorporate an unused<br>
category into the construction rule, the user selects<br>
it with the ↑ and ↓ buttons and presses the "Insert"<br>
but.ton. The category is again incorporated into the<br>
navigation tree, in last position. If this category has<br>
more than one level, for example the Topic category, an<br>
action on the "Insert" button allows insertion into the<br>
tree if the number cf levels already used in the rule<br>
is less than the total number of levels of the<br>
category.<br>
The place of a category in the navigation tree<br>
is modified as follows. Pressing the "Move" button with<br>
a category selected causes the icon of this category to<br>
frash. The user can then move around with the ↑ and ↓<br><br>
buttons and choose the level into which he wishes to<br>
insert this category. The insertion is confirmed by<br>
pressing the "OK" button.<br>
Pressing the "OK" button with a category<br>
selected affords access to the menu making it possible<br>
to define the search criteria corresponding to this<br>
category, that is to say the list of classification<br>
elements for this category. That is how the user makes<br>
his selection. Let us assume that from the menu<br>
presented in Figure 3, the user presses once on the ↓<br>
button so as to select the "Topic" category, as shown<br>
in Figure 4. The user then presses once on the "OK"<br>
button so as to confirm the entry into the menu for<br>
selecting the classification elements.<br>
The menu of Figure 5 appears, the filtering<br>
colunn contains the classification elements for the<br>
"Topic" category as well as the "Confirm" and "All<br>
Topics" icons. The later icon enables the user not to<br>
exclude any topic. By confirming this element, all the<br>
topics are included in the request for documents which<br>
are selected regardless of their topics. By navigating<br>
with the help of the t and 4- buttons, the user can<br>
select each element by marking it out visually. By<br>
pressing on the "Delete" button, he excludes this<br>
element from the request for documents, and the right<br>
part of this element is then empty. By pressing on the<br>
"Insert" button, he includes this element in the<br>
request for documents, and the right part of this<br>
element contains a cross (x) .<br>
The "Confirm" icon at the bottom of the<br>
filtering column makes it possible to confirm the<br>
selection of topics. The activating of this icon causes<br>
a return to the menu of Figure 2. If the "All Topics"<br>
icon has been selected, the symbol "All" is displayed<br>
in the right part of the "Topic" icon of the filtering<br>
column.<br>
The "Topic" category is a particular case since<br>
each element of this category is itself a category. In<br>
this instance, when the user selects a topic, the GIUD<br><br>
module can propose several subtopics to him. Thus, if<br>
the "Sport" icon is selected and if the user presses<br>
the "OK" button, the GIUD module proposes that he<br>
individually select the elements of the "Sport"<br>
subtopic of the "Topic" category. The menu of Figure 4<br>
then appears. The "Source" category could also have<br>
been decomposed inio two Levels, the first<br>
corresponding to the programme bouquets and the second<br>
to the programmes. This decomposition can be<br>
appreciable when numerous programmes are available, for<br>
example more than a hundred.<br>
In the menu of Figure 6, the filtering column<br>
contains the elements of the "Sport" subtopic. As<br>
before, the user can select all "he elements (via the<br>
"All Sports" icon) . He can also individually include<br>
and exclude each sports category in the request for<br>
documents with the help of the "Insert" and "Delete"<br>
buttons. The "Confirm" icon at the bottom of the<br>
filtering column makes it possible to confirm the<br>
selection of subtopics. The activating of this icon<br>
causes a return to the menu of Figure 4. If the user<br>
has previously selected the "All Sports" icon, the<br>
right part of the icon corresponding to sport contains<br>
the word "All". In the example of Figure 5, this is the<br>
case for the "Film", "Culture", "Education" subtopics.<br>
If the user has previously selected only part of the<br>
subtopics, the right part of the icon contains a cross<br>
(X) . This is the case for the "Music" and "Sport"<br>
topics. If the user has not selected any subtopic,<br>
these amounts to not selecting this topic, so the right<br>
part is empty.<br>
When the user confirms the selection of the<br>
top:_c by actuating the "Confirm" icon, the GIUD module<br>
returns to the menu of Figure 4 while updating the<br>
right part of the element corresponding to the<br>
category.<br>
With the help of the menus described earlier in<br>
Figures 5 and 6, the user can modify the search<br>
criteria for all the classification categories.<br><br>
Figure 7 shows an exemplary navigation tree and<br>
the current state of navigation through this tree.<br>
Under the root, the first level corresponds to the<br>
"Period" category; the second level corresponds to the<br>
"Source" category; the third and fourth levels<br>
correspond to the "Topic" category; and the fifth level<br>
corresponds to the "Rating" category. In this tree, the<br>
current position of navigation is the "Satellite<br>
Channel" node of the "This evening" branch under the<br>
root. This node, framed in Figure 7, is called the<br>
"current node". It corresponds to the current level of<br>
the tree.<br>
Figure 8 shows the user interface when the user<br>
simply desires to navigate through the navigation tree<br>
which he has just for example created and such as is<br>
represented in Figure 7. The navigation column of<br>
Figure 8 displays the classification elements<br>
associated with the current level. The filtering column<br>
depicts the categories in the order of traversal of the<br>
tree. It shows the path traversed by navigation<br>
starting from the root (at the top) so as to arrive at<br>
the current node. From the top to the bottom, the first<br>
"Period" level displays "This evening", the second<br>
'Source" level displays "Satellite Channel", which is<br>
ailso highlighted in the navigation column. The<br>
documents column displays the multimedia documents<br>
associated with the current node. These documents<br>
ccorrespond on the one hand to the document search<br>
criteria expressed in the request for documents, and on<br>
the other hand to classification elements selected at<br>
this level of the tree. In the example, the documents<br>
column displays all the documents which comply with the<br>
user's search expressed in the request for documents,<br>
rind which are available both "This evening" and on<br>
"Satellite Channel".<br>
In the navigation column, the user navigates<br>
between the current level and its adjacent levels with<br>
the help of the ↑ and ↓ buttons. To go down one level<br>
in the next tree by selecting the classification<br><br>
element highlighted in the navigation column, the user<br>
presses the "OK" button. To go up one level, the user<br>
can select a "Return" icon, not represented in Figure<br>
8, then press the "OK" button. Another approach<br>
consists in configuring a button entitled "Return" on<br>
the remote control. With each navigation action, the<br>
list in the documents column is updated, as is the<br>
navigation state presented in the filtering column.<br>
From this menu, the user can return to the filtering<br>
column with the help of the ← button or go to the<br>
right-hand column so as to select a multimedia document<br>
by pressing the → button.<br>
An improvement consists in jumping by several<br>
levels for one and the same command when, together,<br>
they offer the user only a single choice, that is to<br>
say they contain only a single classification element.<br>
For example, if from a certain level of the tree<br>
onwards, all the documents are in French, the choice of<br>
language is not in fact a filtering criterion, since<br>
the number of documents remains the same. Therefore,<br>
the documents list, associated with the "Language" level<br>
and the list of the level situated immediately above<br>
are identical. If the level above "Language" is the<br>
current one, a downward navigation command will not<br>
select the "Language" level as the current level, but<br>
the level immediately below. As in the case of the<br>
"Language" level, this level is displayed only if it is<br>
associated with more than one classification element,<br>
otherwise it is the level below which is displayed, and<br>
so on and so forth, the navigation command in this case<br>
performing a jump of three or more levels. Likewise,<br>
the branches which do not contain documents are not<br>
displayed to the user.<br>
This improvement is achieved with the help of<br>
the application of two optimisation algorithms to the<br>
navigation tree, in the order<br>
deletion of branches which contain no document,<br>
and<br><br>
elimination of internal nodes, which have no<br>
brother node. When such a node is eliminated,<br>
all its child nodes become the child nodes of<br>
the father node of the eliminated node.<br>
Starting from the navigation column, the user<br>
presses once on the → button of the remote control so<br>
as to select the right-hand column. The menu of Figure<br>
7 then appears. By navigating with the help of the t<br>
and ↓ arrows, the user can select a document. By<br>
actuating the "OK" button of this remote control, the<br>
document is activated. If this is an audio-visual<br>
transmission, it is then displayed and one exits the<br>
GIUD module. If this is a programme or an interactive<br>
servj.ce, it is then executed. If the document is not<br>
currently accessible, the GIUD module displays a<br>
message indicating unavailability and offers the user<br>
the possibility of programming an automatic recall of<br>
this document when it becomes accessible, automatic<br>
recording of the document, etc.<br>
In the documents column, if the number of<br>
documents exceeds the display capacity of the column,<br>
the "Previous Page" and "Next Page" icons appear at: the<br>
top and at the bottom. The documents are then displayed<br>
blockwise one page at a time.<br>
With the help of the menus presented, the user<br>
can redefine the document search criteria for each<br>
category (Figures 3 and 4) and/or the navigation<br>
structure according to his preferences (Figure 10). The<br>
search filter, and hence the navigation tree, can be<br>
modified at any time during the navi.gation by the user,<br>
either to refine the search and/or the navigation<br>
structure (by eliminating for example classification<br>
elements), or to completely change the search strategy.<br>
Each time a new search filter is defined, a new<br>
navigation tree is constructed by the GIUD, and the<br>
navigation by the user takes place in the new tree.<br>
When the navigation tree is modified, it is<br>
important to guarantee the user continuity of<br>
navigation. This is especially important in the case<br><br>
where the user's aim is to improve the search and/or<br>
the navigation structure. Indeed, he should not be<br>
compelled to repeat the navigation starting from the<br>
root of the tree. For example, when the user arrives at<br>
an internal node of the tree, it may transpire that the<br>
category used for the level immediately below gives an<br>
unsatisfactory distribution of documents.<br>
So, he can ask to change category for this<br>
level. When the modification is made, it is entirely<br>
natural for the user to be faced with classification<br>
elements of the new category used.<br>
In order to guarantee continuity of navigation,<br>
certain constraints regarding dynamic filter<br>
modification need to be complied with. The following<br>
operations guarantee continuity of navigation:<br>
•	modifying the tree construction rule (adding a<br>
level, deleting a level, changing level of a<br>
cate;gory) for the levels below the current<br>
navigation level, or<br>
•	adding new document search criteria to the<br>
request without modifying the tree construction<br>
rules.<br>
When the user performs a filter modification<br>
which does not guarantee continuity of navigation, the<br>
system signals this tc him. When the new tree is<br>
constructed, the system uses the following algorithm to<br>
position the new current node in the new tree as close<br>
as possible to the former node in the former tree:<br>
•	with each navigation action by the user, the<br>
system notes the course of the current node as<br>
being the run of classification elements<br>
associated with all the nodes between the root<br>
and the current node,<br>
•	when a category is deleted or moved by a level<br>
between the root and the current node, the<br>
corresponding classification element is deleted<br>
from the course of the former current node,<br>
•	the new current node is the node whose course is<br>
the longest run which is identical to the start<br><br>
of the modified course of the former current<br>
node.<br>
The present invention enables the user to<br>
construct his own user navigation interface structure<br>
Toy" "defining his own search filter. Advantageously, the<br>
multimedia terminal systematically stores in a non-<br>
volatile memory the latest search filter defined by the<br>
user. In this way, when it is instigated, the GIUD<br>
module takes up the same configuration as during the<br>
lates"" use. A variant consists in employing a button<br>
entitled " "Store" allowing this storage. The<br>
configuration set in place during the instigating of<br>
the module is then that which the user has stored<br>
manually. An improvement consists in the module storing<br>
the latest search filters and, with the help of a<br>
statistical processing, determining the one whose<br>
components are most often used. It is this search<br>
filter which will be proposed during the next use of<br>
the module.<br>
It is important to note that the user interface<br>
just described can be used in any multimedia terminal<br>
in so far as this terminal possesses audio and video<br>
capabilities which are sufficiently effective to enable<br>
a user to see and/or listen to multimedia documents.<br><br><br>
