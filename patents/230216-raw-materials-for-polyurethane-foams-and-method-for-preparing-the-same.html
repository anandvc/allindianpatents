				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to raw materials for polyurethane foams<br>
and a method for preparing the same. More particularly, the present invention<br>
relates to raw materials for anti-cracking polyurethane foams and a method for<br>
preparing the same.<br>
2.	Description of the Background Art<br>
In general, polyurethane foams is obtained by reacting a polyol<br>
component and a isocyanate component in the presence of a foam blowing<br>
agent, a reaction catalyst and other additives.<br>
The polyurethane foams have the most excellent adiabatic material<br>
among organic and inorganic adiabatic materials. With the merits of excellent<br>
adiabatic property due to the construction of independent pores and that a low<br>
density foams can be prepared by controlling a use amount and a type of a<br>
foam blowing agent, the polyurethane foams is generally adopted to a<br>
refrigerator, a freezing container or a low-temperature warehouse that need a<br>
high adiabatic property.<br>
In case that rigid polyurethane foams are used for a refrigerator, it also<br>
serves to maintain an intensity of a refrigerator as well, besides the role as the<br>
adiabatic material.<br><br>
In addition, a structure and configuration of the refrigerator affects a<br>
polyurethane flow, and the basic materials of a refrigerator are constructed by<br>
triple conjugate of iron/polyurethane foams/liner, so that a stress caused due to<br>
a difference of linear expansion coefficients of the materials is additionally<br>
applied to the refrigerator.	Such a structure varies under many testing<br>
conditions in a refrigerator state according to mechanical characteristics of the<br>
polyurethane foams at a middle portion. Especially, failing to tolerate the stress,<br>
a foam crack occurs therein to even cause a crack in the liner being in contact<br>
therewith.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Therefore, an object of the present invention is to provide raw materials<br>
for polyurethane foams that is capable of reducing a physical property<br>
degradation of a vertical/horizontal flow portion of polyurethane foams and<br>
cracking caused by a linear expansion coefficient among triple conjugate<br>
(iron/poiyurethane/iiner).<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a preparation<br>
method of polyurethane foams with a reduced crack.<br>
To achieve these and other advantages and in accordance with the<br>
purpose of the present invention, as embodied and broadly described herein,<br>
there is provided raw materials for polyurethane foams comprises;<br>
 100 weight parts of a mixed polyol consisting of:<br>
45-60 wt.% of polyol (a) obtained by polymerization with an organic<br><br>
oxide by taking sorbitol of a hexa-valent functional group as an initiator,<br>
15-35 wt.% of poiyol (b) obtained by polymerization with an organic<br>
oxide by taking toluene diamine (IDA) of a tetra-valent functional group as an<br>
initiator,<br>

-	1.0~3.0 weight parts of an additive.<br>
OH values of the mixed poiyol composition are as follows:<br>
(a)	OH value of poiyol (a) obtained by polymerization with an organic<br>
oxide by taking sorbitol of hexa-valent functional group as an initiator: 460<br>
(b)	OH value of poiyol (b) obtained by polymerization with an organic<br>

(e)	OH value of polyol (e) obtained by polymerization with an organic<br>
oxide by taking E.D.A of tetra-valent functional group as an initiator: 635<br>
The OH value signifies the value of mg of KOH required for neutralizing<br>
acetic acid combined with acetyl compound obtained from polyol 1g (mgKOH/g),<br>
which is obtained by the following equation:<br>
OHV = 56100 x the number of functional group of polyol / molecular<br>
weight of polyol<br>

crack can be prepared by mixing a mixed polyol composition having a special<br>
constitution, a isocyanate, water, a foam blowing agent, a special catalyst<br>
package and a resin stock solution containing additives.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Each component of the present invention will now be described in detail.<br>
Polyol<br>
Currently, polyol used in the polyurethane industry is a poly-functional<br>
alcohol with an ether (C-O-C) structure, and obtained by polymerization with an<br>
organic oxide by taking a compound having two or more active hydrogens as<br>
an initiator.<br>
In the present invention, besides the basic physical property, the<br>
physical property of polyol is improved by combining components in order to<br>
better an adhesive force.<br>
Polyol (a) used in the present invention is obtained by polymerization<br>
with an organic oxide by taking sorbitol of a hexa-valent functional group as an<br>
initiator, and has an OH value of 460. Polybol (b) is obtained by polymerization<br>
with an organic oxide by taking T.D.A of a tetra-valent functional group as an<br>
initiator, and has an OH value of 350. Polyol (c) is obtained by polymerization<br>
with an organic oxide by taking ester of a penta-valent functional group as an<br>
initiator, and has an OH value of 330. Polyol (d) is obtained by polymerization<br>
with an organic oxide by taking glycerin of a tri-valent function group as an<br><br>
initiator, and has an OH value of 280. Polyol (e) is obtained by polymerization<br>
with an organic oxide by taking E.D.A of a tetra-valent functional group as an<br>
initiator, and has an OH value of 635.<br>
Over the entire weight of polyol, polyol (a) is contained by 45~60 wt.%,<br>
polyol (b) is contained 15~35 wt.%, polyol (c) is contained 2.5~7.5 wt.%, polyol<br>
(d) is contained by 10~15 wt.%.<br>
Polyol (e) is an arbitrary component, so that it may not be contained,<br>
and may be contained by 10 wt.% and below over the entire weight of polyol.<br>
Isocyanate<br>
Isocyanate is an organic compound containing isocyanate group (-<br>
NCO) in its molecule, making a principal component together with polyol in<br>
preparing polyurethane.<br>
In the present invention, isocyanate such as MDI (diphenylmethane<br>
diisocyanate) or TDI (Toluene diisocyanate) can be used, which is generally<br>
used for preparation of polyurethane foams. In this respect, in the general<br>
poiyurethane foams, a generally used index numeric is about 1.0~1.2, not much<br>
high.<br>
Isocyanate is used by an amount of 140~180 weight parts per polyol<br>
100 weight parts, and preferably, by an amount of about 160 weight parts per<br>
polyol 100 weight parts.<br>
If isocyanate is used by less amount than the above range, it is difficult<br>
to form polyurethane foams, while if isocyanate is used by more amount than<br>
the above range, a low-temperature dimensional stability is degraded and<br>
breaks of foams occur.<br><br>
Catalyst<br>
A catalyst shortens a reaction time in formation of foams, and controls a<br>
flowability of foams related to generation of pores.<br>
The catalyst used in the present invention is roughly divided into three<br>
kinds, that is, a foaming catalyst, a gelation catalyst and a trimerization catalyst.<br>
The catalyst can be suitably controlled in its amount to use according to<br>
shape and structure of the real refrigerator, and in the present invention, it is<br>
used by the amount of 1.0~3.0 over polyol 100 weight parts.<br>
A catalyst package of the present invention contains a catalyst 'A', a<br>
catalyst 'B' and an arbitrary catalyst 'C.<br>
The catalyst 'A' is obtained by mixing a gelling agent and the foaming<br>
catalyst by 1:1.<br>
The gelling agent has an influence on a reactivity of foams. It attacks<br>
MDI, making MDI to react with polyol, to produce a polyurethane resin.<br>
Representative gelling agents include DMCHA (N,N-dimethyl cyclohexyl amine),<br>
TMHDA (tetra methyl hexane diamine), TEDA (triethylene diamine), or the like.<br>
The foaming catalyst serves to facilitate a reaction between MDI to<br>
supply heat required for foaming, and accelerate polyol and MDI to make a<br>
resinification reaction. Representative foaming catalyst is a PMDETA<br>
(pentamethylene diethylene triamine), BDMEE, or the like.<br>
The catalyst 'A' is used by the amount of 0,1-1.5 weight parts per<br>
polyol 100 weight parts.<br>
The catalyst 'B' accelerates a trimerization reaction which forms<br>
isocyanurate as a trimer, by reacting three isocyanates, for which quaternary<br><br>
ammonium salt and 2,4,6-tris-dimethylaminomethyl) phenol) are used.<br>
The catalyst 'B' is used by the amount of 0.1~0.5 weight parts per<br>
polyol 100 weight parts.<br>
The catalyst 'C is a mixed catalyst as a strong foaming catalyst, that is,<br>
the so-called formic acid. General use of the catalyst 'C betters a flowability of<br>
a composition so that an end flowing of a polyurethane foam is improved. The<br>
catalyst 'C is an arbitrary component, and it is used in case polyol (e), which is<br>
also an arbitrary component, is used. In case of being added, the catalyst 'C is<br>
added by the amount of 1.0~1.5 weight parts per polyol 100 weight parts.<br>
Foam blowing agent<br>
Generally, foam blowing agents used for rigid polyurethane foams<br>
include water, carboxyl acid or fluoro carbon group foam blowing agent.<br>
In the present invention, water as a chemical foam blowing agent and a<br>
fluoro carbon group foam blowing agent as a physical foam blowing agent are<br>
used as foam blowing agents.<br>
Water is injected by the amount of 1~2.2 weight parts per poiyol 100<br>
weight parts, and preferably, by the amount of about 2 weight parts per polyoi<br>
100 weight parts.<br>
If the amount of use of water over the polyol component 100 weight<br>
parts is less than 1 weight parts, a compression intensity or a low-temperature<br>
dimensional stability is degraded. If the amount of use of water exceeds 2<br>
weight parts, a thermal conductivity is much degraded.<br>
In the present invention, a dichloromonofluoroethane (HCFC-141b) is<br>
used as a fluoro carbon group foam blowing agent. The organic foam blowing<br><br>
agent is preferably used by the amount of about 30.0~35.0 weight parts over<br>
polyol 100 weight parts.<br>
Additives<br>
In the present invention, a silicon surface active agent, which is a<br>
foaming stabilizer, may be used,<br>
Like in the rigid polyurethane foams, the silicon surface active agent<br>
improves a mixture efficiency without a mutual solubility, and stabilizes a cell by<br>
restraining formation and growth of irregular pores.<br>
In the present invention, as an additive, the silicon surface active agent<br>
is used by the amount of 1.0~3.0 per polyol 100 weight parts, and preferably, by<br>
the amount of about 2.0 weight parts per polyol 100 weight parts.<br>
As necessary, a stabilizer such as a filler, an antioxidant or an<br>
ultraviolet absorbent, and a colorant, which are generally used in other<br>
urethane chemistry, may be added<br>
As mentioned above, the rigid polyurethane foams of the present<br>
invention can be prepared by reacting a mixed polyol component of a particular<br>
composition and a polyiisocyanate component as the principal raw materials in<br>
the presence of water, a foam blowing agent, a reaction catalyst package and<br>
additives.<br>

The accompanying drawings, which are included to provide a further<br><br>
understanding of the invention and are incorporated in and constitute a part of<br>
this specification, illustrate embodiments of the invention and together with the<br>
description serve to explain the principles of the invention.<br>
In the drawings:<br>

cracking occurrence mechanism; and<br>
Figure 2 is a graph showing a measurement result of tan5 of<br>
polyurethane foams in accordance with the present invention.<br>
| Example ]<br>
Example 1<br>
As shown in table 1, 100 weight parts of a mixed polyol (polyol (a), (b),<br>
(c) and (d)), 2.1 weight parts of water, 30.0~35.0 weight parts of HCFC-141b<br>
(dichloromofluoroethane) as a foam blowing agent, 2 weight parts of a silicon<br>
surface active agent, a catalyst package ('A', !B' and 'C') and 160.95 weight<br>
parts of MDI (diphenylmethane diisocyanate) were mixed, on which foaming<br>
and hardening was performed to prepare a sample of rigid polyurethane foams.<br>
Example 2<br>
As shown in Table 1, 100 weight parts of a mixed polyol (polyol (a), (b),<br>
(c) (d) and (e)), 2 weight parts of water, 30.0~35.0 weight parts of HCFC-141b<br>
(dichloromofluoroethane) as a foam blowing agent, 2 weight parts of a silicon<br>
surface active agent, a catalyst package (!A' 'B' and 'C') and 160.31 weight<br>
parts of MDI (diphenylmethane diisocyanate) were mixed, on which foaming<br>
and hardening was performed to prepare a sample of rigid polyurethane foams.<br><br><br>
The polyurethane foams prepared with the raw materials in accordance<br>
with the present invention exhibit various physical properties according to a<br>
constitution of the raw material composition.<br>
In addition, since the construction of system differs depending on the<br>
foam blowing agent, there can be a difference in the adiabatic value and the<br>
injection amount (JUST pack) of the foams. Both examples 1 and 2 used<br>
HCFC-141b system.<br>
The physical property of the foams to be especially mentioned herewith<br>
is tanδ, alternative characteristics for a foam crack.<br><br>
TanS was measured by using a general dynamic mechanical thermal<br>
analyzer (DMTA), and a visco-elasticity was evaluated by a ratio between a<br>
storage modulus and a loss modulus of polyurethane foams transmitted by<br>
applying 1 Hz frequency to a test sample.<br>
A large visco-elasticity signifies that the toss modulus is greater than<br>
the storage modulus, and such a rigid foam is weak for cracking.<br>
Visco-elasticity: tanδ<br>
Modulus : E1 = (σ0/e0)cosσ (storage modulus) and E2 = (σ0/e0)sinσ (loss<br>
modulus)<br>
tan§ = sinσ/ COSΣ = E2/E.,<br>
As noted in the above definitions, if the loss modulus for resolving a<br>
stress is greater than the storage modulus produced upon receiving a stress<br>
transmitted to polyurethane foams, the value of tan5 becomes great, so that a<br>
resistance force against the cracking of polyurethane foams becomes great.<br>
As a matter of course, besides the above described method, a foam<br>
crack testing can be performed under a desired temperature and environment<br>
conditions by using a jig.<br>
As shown in Figure 1, the foam crack testing was performed by using a<br>
testing method that a visco-elasticity effect is mixed to a tension, a bending and<br>
a geometric effect, which is as follows.<br>
A foam crack testing can be performed under various environments<br>
and temperatures as intended by fabricating a genera! jig as shown in Figure 1,<br>
and a foam crack related testing can be preformed by the following three<br><br>
methods.<br>
As shown in Figure 1A, test 1 uses an apparatus devised to be initiated<br>
from a marginal portion of a circle, the weakest portion, and indicating a tension<br>
situation.<br>
The central portion of a square jig is open in a circular form and the<br>
marginal portion of the circle is weakest, so that when a temperature is<br>
changed, existence or nonexistence of a crack at this portion is evaluated.<br>
As shown in Figure 1B, test 2 uses an apparatus for measuring a<br>
bending situation to evaluate a situation that polyurethan flowing differs due to<br>
a thickness difference. Foam crack existence and nonexistence is tested at the<br>
portion with the weakest thickness change when an external force is applied to<br>
foams with different thicknesses.<br>
As shown in Figure 1C, test 3 is a method for testing a geometric effect<br>
that a structural shape and polyurethane flowing direction are the opposite by<br>
changing the flowability of foams. Foam crack existence and nonexistence at<br>
the structural portion causing a change in a form of the foams are evaluated.<br>
The physical measurement result of each example is shown in Table 2<br>
and tan5 was shown in Figure 2.<br><br><br><br>
As observed in the physical measurement results of the examples 1<br>
and 2, it is considered that example 2 exhibits a raw material composition<br>
excellent in the aspect of the foam crack besides the basic physical property,<br>
and Embodiment 1 exhibits the best combined system in other physical<br>
properties except for the foam crack.<br>
As noted in Figure 2, though example 2 shows a bit high tanS value<br>
compared to that of example 1, but with no remarkable numeric difference. This<br>
is considered a limitation of the HCFC-141b system foam, and when evaluated<br>
by testing, the level of example 2 is superior to that of example 1.<br>
Accordingly, it is noted that as the tan5 is increased, the system is<br>
favored to the foam crack in the flow direction of polyurethane or in the<br>
structural foam.<br>
The biggest factor among factors dominating the physical properties is<br>
the combination of polyol. However, every characteristic is not made by the<br>
constitution of polyol. Some special basic polyol are critical factors affecting<br>
reduction in the amount of catalyst in a strong reactivity and the construction of<br>
the system. Thus, in order to have effective characteristics in numerous<br>
physical properties such as an overall thermal conductivity, a demoldability, a<br>
flowability, a dimensional stability and a strength, the overall construction of the<br>
 system is important.<br><br>
As so far described, the raw materials for anti-cracking polyurethane<br>
foams and method of preparing the polyurethane foams has advantages that,<br>
unlike in the conventional method, the OH value of polyol is lowered down and<br>
a catalyst package is changed, to thereby improve a ductility of polyurethane<br>
foams. Thus, foam crack does not occur in a refrigerator under a temperature<br>
change and low-temperature conditions.<br><br>
