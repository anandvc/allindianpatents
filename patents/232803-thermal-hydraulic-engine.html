				<td>THERMAL HYDRAULIC ENGINE Field of the Invention<br>
The invention relates to an engine that is powered by the expansion and contraction of a working fluid as heat is alternately applied to and removed from the working fluid.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Typically, energy is not in readily utilizable forms. Many means exist for converting one type of energy to another. For example, an internal combustion engine can turn the explosive force of a fuel burned in its cylinders into mechanical energy that eventually turns the wheels of a vehicle to propel a vehicle.  An internal combustion engine channels energy resulting from the burning of a fuel in a cylinder into a piston.  Without the cylinder and piston, the energy resulting from the burning of the gas would simply spread out in every available direction.  Another example of a device to convert one form of energy into another is a windmill.  If connected to an electric generator, windmills can convert the mechanical action of moving air into electricity.<br>
While an internal combustion engine typically produces mechanical energy from the burning of fossil fuels, such as gasoline, diesel fuel, or natural gas or alcohols, other attempts have been made to produce mechanical energy from the<br>
movement of members such as pistons by means other than the burning of fossils fuels.  However, most of these devices still operate on the basic principle of providing a force to drive a moveable member such as a piston.  The difference among the various devices in the way in which the force is produced to move the piston and the way in which the force is controlled.<br>
Some of these devices utilize the movement of a working fluid to drive a moveable member, such as a piston.  Other devices utilize the phase change in a liquid to drive a moveable member.  In their operation, some devices utilize valves to control the flow of a working fluid in the production of mechanical energy by moving a moveable member.<br>
Due to the worldwide and ever increasing demand, research constantly focuses on ways to produce energy or power the devices that we rely on in our daily lives.  In recent years, another area of research has included alternative sources of energy.  Such research has constantly increased.  Among the reasons for the increased research is an increased awareness of the limited amount of fossil fuels in the earth.  This research may also be spawned by an increased desire to provide energy for people living in remote locations around the world who now live without power.<br>
Among the alternative sources of energy on which research has been focused is solar energy.  Solar energy has been<br>
captured by photovoltaic cells that convert the sun's energy directly into electricity.  Solar energy research is also focused on devices that capture the sun's heat for use in a variety of ways.<br>
As discussed above, in relation to the internal combustion engines and windmill examples, the problem being addressed both by photovoltaic solar cells and solar heating devices is the conversion of one type of energy to another type of energy.  In solar cells, the energy in sunlight is used to excite electrons in the solar cells, thereby converting the sun's energy to electrical energy.  On the other hand, in solar heating cells, the energy of the sun is typically captured by a fluid, such as solar hot water panels typically seen on, the rooftops of residences.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>

Consequently, another advantage of the present invention is that it is substantially non-polluting.<br>
Along these lines, an additional advantage of the present invention is that it may run off heat energy and, therefore, may be solar powered.<br>
Furthermore, an advantage of the present invention is that, since it may be solar powered, it may be utilized to provide power in remote areas.<br>
An additional advantage of the present invention is that it may utilize heat and/or heated water produced by existing processes.  Accordingly, the present invention may make use of heat energy that is otherwise currently not utilized and discarded as waste.<br>
A still further advantage of the present invention is that it may operate without using fossil fuels.<br>
It follows"that an advantage of the present invention is that it may produce energy without contributing to the abundance of waste gases and particles emitted into the atmosphere by the burning of fossil fuels.<br>
Also, an advantage of the present invention is that it may include a relatively simple design that eliminates the need for a complex series of valves to control the flow of a working fluid through the system.<br>
Accordingly, a further advantage of the present invention is that it provides a simple design, thus reducing construction and maintenance costs.<br>
In accordance with these and other objectives and advantages, the present invention provides a thermal hydraulic engine.  The engine includes a frame.  The engine utilizes a working fluid that changes volume with changes in temperature. A working fluid container houses the working fluid.  A cylinder is secured to the frame and includes an interior space.  The cylinder also includes a passage for introducing the working fluid into the interior space.  A piston is housed with the interior space of the cylinder.  The working fluid container, the interior space of the cylinder, the piston, and the working fluid container define a closed space filled by the working fluid.  The engine also includes means for transmitting heat to and removing heat from the working fluid, thereby alternately causing the working fluid to expand and<br>
contract without undergoing a phase change.  The piston moves in response to the expansion and contraction of the working<br>
fluid.<br>

Detailed Description of Various and Preferred Embodiments of the Invention<br>
As stated above, the present invention is an engine that derives power from the expansion and contraction of a working<br>
fluid as heat is alternately applied to and removed from the working fluid.  The expansion and contraction of the fluid is transformed into mechanical energy, via the present invention. The mechanical energy may be utilized directly. Alternatively, the mechanical engine may be turned into another form of energy, such as electricity.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention includes a working fluid that experiences changes in volume with changes in temperature.  Any such fluid may be utilized in a thermal hydraulic engine according to the present invention.  However, more power may be realized from the operation of the engine if the working fluid experiences greater changes in volume over a range of temperatures than fluids that experience lesser changes in volume over the same temperature range.<br>
The present invention operates at least in part on the principle that fluids are generally not compressible. Therefore, according to the present invention, the working fluid does not change form into another state, such as a solid or a gas during the operation of the engine.  However, any fluid that undergoes an expansion or contraction with a change in temperature may be utilized according to the present invention.<br>
Among the characteristics that may be considered in selecting a working fluid are the coefficient of expansion of the working fluid and the speed at which heat is transferred<br>
to the fluid.  For example, if a fluid quickly changes temperature, the speed, of the engine may be faster.  However, in some cases, a fluid that quickly responds to changes in temperature may have a  low coefficient of expansion. Therefore, these factors must balanced in order to achieve the desired effect for the engine.  Other factors that may be considered in selecting a working fluid include any caustic effects that the fluid may have on the working fluid container, the environment, and/or people working with the engine.<br>
A very important factor in determining the size, design, cost, speed, and other characteristics of a thermal hydraulic engine according to the present invention is the working fluid.  Various fluids have various thermal conductivities and coefficients of expansion, among other characteristics, that may effect the characteristics of the engine.  For example, the coefficients of expansion of the working fluid may determine the amount of working fluid necessary to operate the engine.  The coefficient of expansion may also effect the amount of heat necessary to expand the working fluid.<br>
Changing the amount of heat necessary to expand the working fluid may change the size of a solar heat collector providing heat, the size of a heat exchanger imparting heat, among other factors.  In embodiments of the present invention in which heat is provided by other sources of energy, the amount of energy necessary to generate heat to expand the<br>
working fluid may be altered based upon the thermal expansion characteristics.  For example, if a fluid expands to a high degree as heat is imparted to it, less heat will be required to provide the necessary expansion for the engine.  This permits a decrease in the size of solar collectors, a decrease in the amount of energy necessary to expand the fluid or a decrease in the size of the heat exchanger, for example.<br>
Figure 27 shows an example of a thermal hydraulic engine that includes a solar heat source.  Although the embodiment shown in Fig. 27 includes solar heat collectors, a variety of heat sources may be utilized, whether the direct heat transfer or heat exchangers are utilized.  For example, a thermal hydraulic engine according to the present invention may utilize low grade heat to perform work.  A thermal hydraulic engine according to the present invention may also utilize medium and high grade sources for fuel.  Examples of fuel sources that may be utilized include natural gas, hydrogen gas, liquified petroleum gases, gasoline, fuel oils, coal, nuclear, or other fuels.  One skilled in the art would know how to devise a system to impart heat to the working fluid of the present invention when utilizing any of the above-discussed fuels.<br>
An example of a working fluid that may be utilized according to the present invention is water.  Another fluid that may be utilized is mercury. Additionally, other substances that may be utilized as a working fluid include<br>
FREON, synthetic FREONS, FREON R12, FREON R23, and liquified gasses, such as liquid argon, liquid nitrogen, liquid oxygen, for example.  FREON and related substances, such as synthetic FREONS, FREON R12, and FREON R23, may be particularly useful as a working fluid due to the large degree of expansion that they may undergo as heat is introduced into them and the tendency to return to their original volume and temperature upon removal of heat.  Another example of a working fluid that may be utilized according to the present invention is liquid carbon dioxide.  Other fluids that may be utilized as working fluids include ethane, ethylene, liquid hydrogen, liquid oxygen, liquid helium, liquified natural gas, and other liquified gases.  Other working fluids may also be used, as one skilled in the art could determine without undue experimentation once aware of this disclosure.<br>
In order to capture the energy in the expansion of the fluid, the working fluid is housed within a closed space.  The closed space may include many different elements.  However, the closed space typically includes at least a working fluid container.<br>
Preferably, the working fluid entirely fills or substantially entirely fills the interior of the working fluid container when the working fluid is in a non-expanded or substantially non-expanded state.  In other words, typically, the working fluid is placed in the working fluid container at its densest state, wherein it occupies the least amount of<br>
volume.  The working fluid container may then be sealed or connected to other components of the engine.<br>
The volume of the working fluid container depends upon, among other factors, the size of the engine, the application, the amount of working fluid required for the application, the amount that the working fluid expands and contracts with changes in temperature.  The exact interior volume of the working fluid container will be discussed below in relation to specific embodiments.  However, such embodiments are only illustrative in nature and not exhaustive and, therefore, only represent examples of working fluid containers.<br>
Preferably, the working fluid container is made of a material that can withstand the pressure from the working fluid as the working fluid expands.  Materials that may be utilized to form the working fluid container include metals, such as copper, plastics, ceramics, carbon steel, stainless steel or any other suitable materials that may withstand the temperatures and pressures involved in the specific application.  Regardless of the material used, preferably, it is non-deformable or substantially so when subjected to the forces generated by the expansion of the fluid.  The material may change due to the effect of heat but preferably not due to the force from the expanding fluid.  The non-deformability of the material that working fluid container is made is helpful for transmitting the force of the expansion of the working<br>
fluid to whatever moveabie member, such as a piston, the particular embodiment of the present invention includes.<br>
Another stress that the working fluid container is subjected to results from the heating and cooling of the working fluid.  As the temperature of the working fluid increases, the working fluid container may expand, due to the application of heat.  Similarly, as the working fluid cools, the materials in contact with the fluid will cool and may contract.<br>
Therefore, regardless of the material used, not only should it be capable of withstanding temperatures and pressures of a particular application, but it must also be able to withstand the changes in temperatures and pressures that continuously occur during the operation of a thermal hydraulic engine according to the present invention.  For instance, metal fatigue could be a problem in embodiments in which are made of metal.  However, metal fatigue may be overcome by those skilled in the art who can adapt the particular metal to the particular conditions involved in a particular embodiment.<br>
Accordingly, it is preferable that the materials in contact with the working fluid, such as the working fluid container, also have some elastic characteristics.  A material that is excessively brittle might tend to crack and leak, rendering the engine inoperable.<br>
The number of working fluid containers included an embodiment of the present invention typically depends upon the number of cylinders or other devices utilized for capturing the energy of the expansion of the working fluid.  Preferably, the number of working fluid containers is equal to the number of expansion capturing devices.  However, it. conceivable that there could be more or less working fluid containers.<br>
For example, one embodiment of the present invention includes a piston that is moved back and forth within a cylinder in both directions by the expansion of the working fluid.  Such an embodiment may include two working fluid containers for each cylinder.  Therefore, as can be appreciated, the number of working fluid containers in the embodiment of the invention may vary.<br>
The working fluid container may be interconnected with a cylinder.  Alternatively, the working fluid container may be isolated in a fluid containment system.  According to such a system, the force generated by the expansion of the working fluid is not transmitted directly to a piston or other movable member, but is indirectly transmitted.<br>
If the working fluid container and cylinder are connected so that the force of the expansion of the working fluid is directly transmitted to a piston or other movable member, the working fluid container and cylinder may be interconnected in a variety of ways.  For example, a tube, hose or other conduit<br>
may be utilized to connect the working fluid container with the cylinder.  Alternatively, the working fluid container may be directly connected to the cylinder.  Preferably, if the cylinder is connected to the working fluid container with a hose or other conduit, the hose or conduit is also made of a material the resists changes in shape as a result of the forces applied by the expansion of the working fluid.  An example of such a material includes steel reinforced rubber hose.<br>
As stated above, the working fluid may be isolated in the working fluid container.  According to such embodiments, rather than being directly transmitted to the piston, the force of the expanding fluid may be transmitted to a hydraulic fluid, which then transmits the force to the piston.<br>
According to such embodiments, the working fluid is housed within the working fluid container.  The working fluid container is in contact with the heat exchanger.  However, rather than the working fluid traveling from the working fluid container into a cylinder to actuate a piston as the fluid expands, the end of the working fluid container that is not surrounded by the heat exchanger is closed a flexible blind flange.<br>
In the embodiment shown in Figure 12, the working fluid container and the hydraulic system may be thought as defining two sections making up an overall fluid containment system.<br>
The flexible blind flange 180 may be thought of as isolating the working fluid.  Therefore, the working fluid container 182 in such embodiments may be referred to as a fluid isolation section.  Another part of Lhe fluid containment system is the hydrauiic system 184.  The hydraulic system may be thought of as a transfer sestion that transfors the fores of the working<br>

As discussea above,  working fluid expands and, eir  or indirectly,  expanding fluid is directed to a cylinder.   cylinder its at  heart of  invention since  cylinder nouses  piston that  force of  expanding working  is transmitted to, reby moving  cylinder and nical energy produced by invention.<br>
As with  working fluid container and or components of  invention,  cylinder may be made of a variety of materials.   above discussion regarding stresses on working fluid oaiuei and  material that it is made of applies to l;he cylinder. Accordingly,  same materials may be utilisd. to form  cylinder.<br><br>
size vf  cylinder may vary, depending upon a nujiber of factors related to  specific application. Factors that may be important is determining  size of cylinder irduda, amciig oThers,  number of cylinders, r.he particul.'ii load on 'The engine, and  amount of ver to js pi'cciucec..

According to this embodiment,  cylinder 200 includes a connecting member 204, such as a fork or or suitable member, that may be pivotabiy joined to a complementary member on  frame 202. A pin 205  rcaar.ja for connecting  cylinder tc  Sraie thai: may be uciiized. . As  piston moves through its cycle, and crankshaft rotates, t.hs cylinder will pivot about its anrhor.<br>

Trie anchor is movably mounted within a guide 208.  guide 208 permit anchor to slide from right to left as shown i" Figures 17. Tne guide 208 may be directly or indirectly connected to  frame 202.<br>
 floaci. anchor permits  piston to contract without having to wait tor  crankshaft to continue its rotation and without, having to overcome any or forces tending acting or.  piston in a direction opposite to its return stroke.<br>
Regardless of  embodiment of  present invention, it may include a floating anchor.<br>
Figura 20 shews an embodiment of a rmal hydraulic engine according to  present invention that includes spring.1? 210 that bias or tend to move  piston in <br>
direction of its return stroke.  If  engine includes springs, it may include at least one spring.  Use of springs to cause  cylinder to move in  direction of its return stroke may be important to maintain a pressure on  working fluid at all times.  With some working fluids, this is particularly important, such as with FREON, FREON substitutes and analogous compounds.<br>
According to  embodiments shown in Figures 5, 6, and 7,  working fluid is introduced into one end of cylinder.  refore, cylinders according to se embodiments include a connection only at this end.  However, according to or embodiments, discussed below in greater detail, return stroke, as well as  power stroke, is powered by a working fluid.  According to such embodiments,  cylinder may include means for introducing a working fluid into both ends of  cylinder.  Such embodiments may also include a seal about a connecting rod attaThed to  piston, as described below in greater detail.<br>
 working cylinders of a rmal hydraulic engine according to  present invention may include a port for passage of working fluid into and out of  cylinder. According to such embodiments,  expansion of  working fluid powers  piston through its power stroke.  Such an embodiment is shown in crosssection in Fig. 25.<br>
In this embodiment, cylinder 326 includes an inlet 328 for introduction of working fluid into  cylinder. Expansion of  working fluid applies force to wall of surface area that defines  space 330 into which  working fluid is introduced.  As  working fluid expands, it applies force to  face 332 of piston 334 located within cylinder 326.  Seal 336 prevents  fluid from entering  remaining portion of  interior volume of  cylinder.  Force applied to  surface of  piston moves  piston into an extended position, as shown by 338.   piston may be powered on its return stroke by forces created by  contraction of fluid, as well as by forces applied to crank arm 340 by or cylinders in a multicylinder engine as y experience ir power stroke or by or forces.<br>
Fig. 26 shows an alternative embodiment of a cylinder according to  present invention that includes two ports 344 and 346 for passage of a working fluid into and out of cylinder.  Including two ports for passage of a working fluid into and out of ' cylinder permits  piston to be powered in both directions of movement.  In or words,  piston constantly experiences a power stroke regardless of direction of movement of  piston.<br>
Such an embodiment does not require outside forces to cause  cylinder to return.  A dual port cylinder also permits one piston to do work in two directions. Significantly, a dual port cylinder may permit a rmal<br>
hydraulic engine according to  present invention to operate with only one cylinder.<br>
Anor benefit of including dual port hydraulic cylinders in a rmal hydraulic engine according to present invention is that  size of  engine may be decreased since  cylinder may provide power to operate a load with  cylinders moving in each direction.  Although  engine may be reduced in size, a single cylinder with two ports cannot replace two cylinders with a single port since  port on  side of  piston where  piston shaft is mounted applies less force to  piston since  surface area of  piston is reduced by  area of  shaft.<br>
An additional added benefit of dual port hydraulic cylinders is that  flow of  working fluid between cylinders may be interconnected.  According to such an embodiment,  main port, which would be  port that fluid flows into to drive  piston in its power stroke in a cylinder that includes only one port, such as port 344 in embodiment shown in Fig. 26, may be connected to a second port, such as  port 346 in  embodiment shown in Fig. 26 of a different cylinder.<br>
An embodiment that includes interconnected cylinders permits a piston to be pushed by a first cylinder being powered by fluid flowing into  main port and pulled by fluid exiting  second port on that cylinder.  According to<br>
such an embodiment,  crankshaft will constantly be rotated by force applied by all cylinders as  pistons are constantly being moved by working fluid flowing into and out of  first and second ports simultaneously.  Such a design permits  size of  engine to be decreased.  According to one embodiment, a rmal hydraulic engine including two ports per cylinder may be decreased by almost onehalf size, compared to an engine that includes single port cylinders.<br>
 effect of a dual port cylinder may be at least partially achieved utilizing a single port cylinder if a gas is provided on  side of  piston opposite  working fluid.   gas may be pressurized to maintain equilibrium of pressures on  piston when  piston is in a fully withdrawn position.  As  piston moves on its power stroke,  gas will be compressed as  working fluid pushes against  piston.   greater hydraulic force of  working fluid will typically be much greater than  pneumatic force provided by  gas.  refore,  gas typically will only slightly restrict  forward motion of  piston.  As working fluid contracts,  hydraulic forces on  piston are reduced.   reduced hydraulic forces typically are close in magnitude to  pneumatic forces generated by  gas, reby permitting  gas to help  piston return to starting position.<br>
 design of a chamber, utilizing a gas as described above as a spring, maybe designed to avoid developing extreme<br>
pressures.   gas pressure should be higher than hydraulic pressure at  equilibrium position.  Additionally,  gas pressure should be great enough to overcome inertia of  piston and  frictional forces of  0ring seal between  piston and  cylinder wall.<br>
As stated above, a rmal hydraulic engine according to  present invention may include only one cylinder.  single cylinder may be power by fluid flowing into and out of two ports included in  vicinity of opposite ends of cylinder.  A single cylinder from a hydraulic engine according to  present invention may also include at least one flywheel attaThed to  transmission system to permit full rotation of a crankshaft.<br>
Fig. 42 shows an embodiment of a transmission that may be utilized with a rmal hydraulic engine according to present invention.   transmission shown in Fig. 42 includes a plurality of gears 800 to gear up  power created by engine.   flywheel 802 is on  higher RPM side of gear up of  transmission.   center shaft 804 is  main crankshaft of  engine, typically operating at a low rate of revolution.   gears are mounted on 6 inch by 0.5 inch steel plates 806.  Also, in  embodiment shown in Fig. 42, gears are mounted about 16 inThes apart.  Of course, one skilled in  art could utilize a different number of gears mounted in a different manner on different supports.  One<br>
skilled in  art could also connect  gears toger and to  engine in a different manner.<br>
Actually, oretically, a rmal hydraulic engine according to  present invention could include a single cylinder that only includes a single port for introduction of a working fluid if a flywheel of a size sufficient to permit rotation of  crankshaft is provided.  One skilled in art could determine  size of  flywheel necessary without undue experimentation based upon  disclosure contained herein.<br>
A displacable member piston may be located within cylinder.  One example of such a displacable member is a piston.   displacable member will slide back and forth along  length of  cylinder in response to changes in volume of  fluid with changes in temperature.<br>
In order to maintain  working fluid in a closed space, preferably,  working fluid is prevented from passing between  cylinder and  piston.  This may be accomplished by providing a piston having a crosssectional area only very slightly less than  crosssectional area.  Also, helping to ensure a seal between  piston and  cylinder is if piston has substantially  same cross sectional shape as ross sectional shape of  interior of  cylinder.<br>
Any space between  piston and  cylinder may be furr sealed by providing a seal about  piston. Alternatively, a seal may be located on  surface of piston facing  interior of  cylinder about  edge of  piston.   seal helps to ensure that  space between  piston and cylinder is sealed.  Sealing  space helps to ensure that any energy that may be derived from  expansion of fluid will be transferred to  piston and not be wasted by fluid leaking between  piston and  cylinder.  If fluid were to leak, it could greatly degrade  performance of  engine.<br>
Figures 14, 14a, and 15 show an alternative embodiment of a piston and cylinder arrangement that may be utilized in an engine according to  present invention.  According to this invention,  working fluid is introduced into  cylinder on both sides of  piston 192.  Accordingly,  area where  piston and  cylinder wall 194 meet is sealed by seals 196 and 198 on both sides of  piston 192.<br>
In order to transmit  force from  piston to a crankshaft or or transmission member, a connecting rod may be attaThed to  piston.  In embodiments without a powered return stroke,  connecting rod may be connected to  side of  piston opposite  side facing  working fluid, or hydraulic fluid in embodiments including a working fluid containment system.  In embodiments including a powered return stroke,  connecting rod is still connected to  piston.<br>
However, both sides of  piston are in contact with working fluid,<br>
In embodiments that include  powered return stroke,  end of  cylinder that  connecting rod 200 projects from must be sailed bv seal 202 to ma.intAn  pressure of  working fluid for  powered return stroke.<br>
As shown in Figure 14a,  force of  working fluid on  side of  piston that is attaThed to  connecting rod 2CO will only be. nrsnuttsd to that  piston 192 surrounding  connecting rod.  This causes a reduced effective force being delivered to  crank shaft.  This reduction in service ares cf  piston may be compensated for by increasing  capacity and speed with which heat is transferred to  working fluid.<br>
Figure 15 shows an alternative embodiment of a rmal hyd engine that includes a flexible blind flange. According to this embodiment,  force generated, indicated by arrows in Figure 16, by  expanding working fluid applies force to  flexible blind flange 204  flange n acts upon, member 2U6', reby displacing member 206. Movement of member 206 may be guided by guide 207..  Member 20G is interconnected with a crankshaft or or drive mechanism (not shown in Figure 16) ,   flange 204 may bs secured between two mounting flanges 208 and 210 similarly to  embodiment shown in Figure 12 .<br>
Regardless of wher  engine includes a powered return stroke,  connecting rod may be fixably or movably attaThed to  piston.  If  connecting rod is fixably attaThed to  piston, n  cylinder preferably is articulately mounted to  frame.  Regardless of wher connecting rod is movably or fixably attaThed to  piston,  connecting rod may include one or more sections.<br>
 connecting rod may be connected to a crank shaft and or transmission elements to drive a device or an electric generator.  In some embodiments,  cylinder is fixedly attaThed to a frame and  connecting rod articulately attaThed to  piston and a crank shaft so that as  piston moves back and forth through its stroke and  crank shaft rotates,  connecting rod will change its position.<br>
As shown in Figs. 23A23H and 24,  cylinders of rmal hydraulic engine according to  present invention may be arranged radially.  Utilizing a radial arrangement of  cylinders in  rmal hydraulic engine may permit a more immediate transfer of energy from  cylinders to crankshaft and whatever load is being placed on  engine. Additionally, a radial arrangement of  cylinders may provide a more direct path through  mechanical system of  engine for forces generated by  working fluid. Furrmore, back pressure, discussed in greater detail below, and or internal loads from  piston and/or piston 0rings<br>
may be more directly handled by  power stroke of  engine with radially arranged cylinders.<br>
An embodiment of a rmal hydraulic engine according to  present invention that includes radially arranged cylinders may include any number of cylinders.   number of cylinders in an embodiment of  present invention that includes a radial arrangement of cylinders may be an even number or an odd number.<br>
 embodiment of  rmal hydraulic engine according to  present invention shown in Figs. 23A23H and Fig. 24 includes four cylinders 300, 302, 304, and 306.   cylinders may be attaThed to frame 299.   pistons (not shown) within  cylinders are connected through crank arms 308, 310, 312, and 314 to a connecting member 316.  To facilitate rotation of  crankshaft and  connecting member 316,  connection between  crank arms 308, 310, 312, and 314 may be articulately mounted to pistons (not shown) located within cylinders 300, 302, 304, and 306 or to connecting member 316.  connecting member 316 may be interconnected through connecting member 318 to crankshaft 320.<br>
Figs. 23A23H illustrate  various positions of pistons, connecting arms, connecting members, and crankshaft throughout a revolution of  engine, as  cylinders experience both power and return strokes.  In Fig. 23A, piston 300 is in its power stroke.  Piston 302 is just beginning its<br>
power stroke.  Additionally, piston 304 has completed its cooling or return stroke.  On  or hand, piston 306 is in  beginning stages of its cooling, or return, stroke.<br>
In  view shown in Figs. 23A23H,  crankshaft is rotating in a clockwise direction.  Piston 304 has completed its cooling cycle on its return stroke and is beginning its heating cycle, but has not yet reaThed its power stroke range. By saying that  piston has not reaThed its power stroke, it is meant that  working fluid has not reaThed a pressure capable of moving  piston at all or more than an insubstantial amount along its power stroke.  In or words,  pressure is not in a range to move  piston and piston is not physically in  range of its power stroke.<br>
Fig. 24 shows a threedimensional perspective view of embodiment of  rmal hydraulic engine shown in Figs. 23A23H.  As can be seen in Fig. 24,  cylinders may be mounted to frame members 322, 324.  Piston mounting frame members 322 and 324 typically are mounted to anor structure or structures to secure m.<br>
In any embodiment of  present invention, and particularly, in an embodiment that includes a radial arrangement of cylinders,  cooling cycle of any one piston preferably permits shrinking of  working fluid at a rate equal to or faster than  expanding of  working fluid in a piston that is in its power stroke during  return stroke<br>
 The piston in question.  If  cooling of  working  not as rapid as  incre ir. t sixers tur» in rkiiiy fluid, trv? •cikjnq trtjback prassura" that rwvy restrict The rcvecr pis.cn in its power stroke.   back pressure may create an unnecessary load 01 tha engirt, hindering  entire operation cl  engine. This is particularly  case in an evobcdi.Tier. an sngine ciccording to The! present: invention chat includes a radial arrangement of ny lenders since  cylinders ars typically d in oppo.inc pairs.<br>
If one cylinder experiences a back pressure as a resul ;  rapid cooling and shrinking of  working fluid, as couipared to  heating and expansion of  working fluid, in anor cylinder undergoing its power stroke at The same tine,  cylinder undergoing its pcwsr stroke will be inhibited in its movement by  back pressure. As such,  back pressure acts as an additional load on  engine ir. addition to whatever lead, such as a pump or or device that  engine is driving,<br>
One way to help prevent,  occurrence of back pressure is to ensure that heat is removed from ths working fluid quickly enough.  This may be accomplished by ensuring a flow of cooling fluid sufficiently rapid to result in a removal of hedt from ths working fluid in  cylinder uridsx'going a return stroke at:  rate equal to or greater than transmission of hsat to  working fluid in  cylinder<br>
undergoing a power stroke.  If, as describe herein,  engine does not include heat exchangers, n preferably,  rate of heat transfer from  working fluid in  cylinder undergoing  return stroke is equal to or greater than rate of transmission of heat to  working fluid in cylinder undergoing  power stroke.  Removal and transmission of heat may be dependent upon characteristics of  working fluid,  cooling source material,  heat exchanger, among or factors.<br>
 transmission elements are n connected to a load to perform a desired function.  For example,  engine could power a water pump, an electric generator, and/or a FREON compressor, among or elements.<br>
In order to transmit heat to and remove heat from working fluid,  working fluid container preferably is in communication with means for transmitting heat to and removing heat from  working fluid contained in  working fluid container.   same means may perform both heating and cooling.  Alternatively,  present invention could include separate means for performing each function.<br>
According to one embodiment,  means for transmitting heat to and removing heat from  working fluid is a heat exchanger.  Depending upon wher it is desired that working fluid be heated or cooled, relatively warmer or relatively cooler water or or material may be introduced<br>
into  heat exchanger.  Preferably, a rmal hydraulic engine according to  present invention includes one heat exchanger for each working fluid container, although an engine according to  present invention could include any number of heat exchangers.<br>
Figure 11 shows an embodiment of heat exchanger or working fluid container according to  present invention. According to this embodiment,  working fluid container 176 is surrounded by  heat exchanger 178.<br>
This heat exchanger includes two openings, an inlet and an outlet.  A relatively hotter or cooler material may be introduced into  heat exchanger to heat or cool  working fluid.  Wher  working fluid is heated or cooled depends at least in part upon wher  material in  heat exchanger is relatively hotter or cooler than  working fluid.   working fluid container may include a plurality of fins or or devices to increase  surface area of working fluid container in contact with  material introduced into  heat exchanger.<br>
Among or alternatives for increasing heat transfer to  working fluid is including a circulation pump in working fluid container.  A circulation pump can create turbulent flow for increased heat transfer speed.<br>
 heat exchanger is one example of a means for transmitting heat to or removing heat from  working fluid.  heat exchanger can be built around  working fluid container wher part of a containment system or not.  In a heat exchanger, typically, high and low temperature fluids are brought into contact with  working fluid container. Typically,  fluid circulating through  heat exchanger is under relatively low pressure.  However,  working fluid changes temperature, depending upon wher it is desired to heat or cool  working fluid.  refore,  heat exchanger preferably is also constructed of a material capable of withstanding  pressures and temperatures that  fluid circulating through it is at.  Examples of materials that may be utilized in  heat exchanger are polyvinylchloride (PVC) pipe, metal pipe such as carbon steel, copper, or aluminum, cast or injected molded plastic, or a combination of any materials capable of withstanding  pressures and temperatures involved in  heat exchanger.<br>
It is not necessary that only a liquid be utilized in heat exchanger to transmit heat to or remove heat from working fluid.  For example, gases or a combination of liquid and gases may also be used in  heat exchanger to heat and/or cool  working fluid.<br>
One advantage of  present invention is that any high and low temperature source material, wher liquids, or gases or transmitted by anor means may be used to heat and cool<br>
 working fluid.  For example, heated waste water from industrial processes could be used to transmit heat to working fluid.  Such water typically is cooled in some manner before being discharged to  environment.  refore, rar than being wasted,  heat in this water could be utilized in  present invention to produce mechanical and/or electrical energy.  As stated above, solar heating and cooling could also be used according to  present invention.  It is this ability to utilize heat and cooling from unutilized sources, such as waste heat, or free sources, such as  sun, that makes  present invention so desirable.<br>
If a fluid is used in  heat exchanger, preferably, liquid and/or gas should be under at least some amount of pressure to ensure that  liquids and/or gases flow through  heat exchanger.  As  heated liquid and/or gas moves through  heat exchanger, it will transfer its greater heat energy to  working fluid having a lower heat energy.  working fluid will n expand, applying force against a piston, flexible barrier or or member, reby producing mechanical energy.<br>
When  working fluid has absorbed as much heat as is possible or as is desired from  heat exchanger, a relatively cooler liquid and/or gas may be transferred through  heat exchanger.   heat in  working fluid will n, according to natural laws, flow to  relatively cooler liquid and/or gas in  heat exchanger.<br><br>
Figure 22 shows an alternative embodiment of a heat exchanger according to  present invention.  According to this embodiment,  heat exchanger 212 is located within working fluid container 214.  According to this embodiment,  working fluid container is also continuous with piston.  According to or embodiments that include  heat exchanger within  working fluid container,  working fluid container may not be continuous with  cylinder.  In Figure 22, distance a represents  travel of  piston between its maximum positions at  power and return strokes.  end 216 of  working fluid container 214 may be sealed with a flange 218 secured between a flange 220 on  working fluid container and an end flange 22 secured to  working fluid container flange 220 with bolts 224.<br>
Figure 5 shows a simple version of a three cylinder engine according to  present invention.   components shown in Figure 5 may not necessarily be in  same physical position in relation to each or in  engine and are shown here in this arrangement for ease of understanding.  engine may also include or components not necessary include in se embodiments or shown in this Figure.<br>
 engine shown in Figure 5 includes three cylinders 100, 102 and 104.  A piston 106, 108, and 110, respectively, is disposed within each of  cylinders.  Each of  pistons is connected to a connecting rod, 112, 114, and 116, respectively, that is connected to a crank shaft 118.<br>
 number of cylinders and pistons included in invention may vary, depending upon  embodiment and factors described above.  An engine utilizing a piston such as that shown in Figures 14 and 15 may utilize only two cylinders and pistons since  pistons will be pushed back into cylinder by  working fluid entering  side of cylinder where  piston is attaThed to  connecting rod. This is because re is less of a need to maintain  speed of  engine to ensure that  pistons will travel back into  cylinders than is necessary when a power a return stroke is not utilized.  Accordingly, without utilizing  power return stroke and only utilizing forward power stroke, it is preferable that  engine include at least three cylinders.<br>
Due to  slow moving nature of  pistons in an engine according to  present invention, it may be necessary to include three pistons to ensure that  pistons will complete ir return stroke.  With three pistons, at least one piston will always be in a power stroke, to help ensure that or piston will help complete ir return stroke.  This occurs because  one piston is always in  power stroke will be furring  rotation of  crank shaft reby helping to move  or pistons along ir return stroke.<br>
However, an engine according to  present invention may include any number of cylinders. For instance, engines can be built with 16, 20, or more cylinders for larger electric power plant operations.<br><br>
 crank shaft is interconnected with a load.   load could be a mechanical device driven by  crank shaft. Anor example of a load could be an electric generator that is driven by  crank shaft.   crank shaft is also connected to a water valve 122 that controls  flow of high and low temperature liquid and/or gas into  heat exchangers.<br>
 cylinders 100, 102, and 104 are each interconnected via a high pressure hose, 124, 126, and 128, respectively, to a working fluid container, 130, 132, and 134, respectively.  working fluid containers 130, 132, and 134 are enclosed within heat exchangers 136, 138, and 140, respectively.  working fluid may be contained within  space defined by heat exchangers 130, 132, and 134,  high pressure connectors 124, 126, and 128 and  interior of  cylinders 100, 102, and 104.  Of course, in embodiments that include a fluid containment system,  working fluid is contained within  working fluid container.  As is evident, in embodiments without  working fluid containment system, <br>
space that  working fluid is contained in changes volume as  piston moves within  cylinder.<br>
Figure 6 shows a series of depictions of  three cylinder engine shown in Figure 5 as  cylinders cycle.  In  embodiment shown in Figure 6, 141 represents an offcenter lobe cam with rocker arm lever and/or push rods to push open water valves.   cam shaft controls  flow of heat and<br>
cooling to  working fluid.  Each cylinder/heat exchanger/working fluid container is represented by 1, 2, and 3 .<br>
 flow of heating and cooling is represented by high temperature water flow into  system 142, low temperature into  system, 144, high temperature return 146, and low temperature return 148.  Flow from  source of high temperature to  system is represented by 150,  flow of low temperature from  low temperature source to  system is 152,  flow from  system to  source of high temperature is represented by 154, and  flow from system to  source of low temperature is represented by 156.<br>
As  cylinders cycle as shown in Figure 6,  high and low temperature fluid flows in and out of  heat exchangers depending upon wher  particular cylinder involved is moving in one direction or anor.  As shown in Figure 5, opening and closing of  valves directing high and low temperature fluid into  heat exchanger may be controlled by a cam shaft directly or indirectly connected to a crank shaft driven by  cylinders.<br>
An indirectly connected cam shaft could be connected to  crank shaft with a timing chain type connection.  Of course, any connection could be used to connect  cam shaft to  crank shaft.   cam shaft could be an offcenter lobe<br>
cam with rocker arm lever and/or push rods to push open water valves leading to  heat exchangers.<br>
Figure 7 shows an embodiment of a rmal hydraulic engine according to  present invention that includes four cylinders 158, 160, 162, and 164.   valves 166 and 168 transmitting hot and cold fluid to and from  heat exchanger are directly controlled by  crank shaft 170.  In Figure 7, piston 158 is in  process of beginning its power stroke. Hot fluid is flowing into heat exchanger 172 associated with piston 158 and also being withdrawn from heat exchanger 172.<br>
Circulating pumps may be driven directly from crankshaft power directly or indirectly.  Indirectly driven circulation pumps could be driven through hydraulic pumps and/or motors.<br>
 cooler fluid, in this case water used to cool working fluid may be obtained from water pumped out of a well by  engine.  As is seen in  embodiment shown in Figure 4,  engine, through a transmission, drives a pump that pumps water from a water source, such as an underground well. An embodiment such as that shown in Figures 2 and 4 may be self sufficient and not require any outside power.  Of course, such an embodiment could be connected to a power line to drive  pump during times of insufficient light, wher during cloudy days or at night.  Alternatively, batteries could be provided to drive  circulation pump at such times.<br>

Figure 2 shows an embodiment of a rmal hydraulic engine that utilizes solar energy to provide heat to heat working fluid and an evaporative cooling system to remove heat from  working fluid. Figure 2 illustrates  flow of heating and cooling water through  various components of  system. Of course, a material or than water may be utilized to heat and cool  working fluid,<br>
As cooling water enters one heat exchanger associated with one cylinder, to draw heat out of  system,  hot water that is created as  cooling water absorbs heat from  working fluid may be recirculated to a hot water reservoir, if  system includes a reservoir.<br>
 system shown in Figure 2 includes solar hot water panels 2 to heat water that will cause  expansion of working fluid.

 chain drive gear may be connected to a hydraulic pump 25 and motor gear up 27 which is ultimately connected to an electric generator 2y. A flywheel 31 may be interconnected between  hydraulic pump and motor gear up to help maintain  cycling of  engine.<br>
Figure 4 vewrsrx a schsiiatic view of anor embodiment of a solar powered rmal hydraulic engine and some associated elerneiits according to  present invention. Heat is delivered to and. removed from  working fluid by relatively hotter  cooler wats::.  As with any embodiment, a material or than  may be used to deliver heat to and remove heat from ths working fluid.  Figure 4 also shows flow of heatid wat:?r through  ay stem.<br>
 embodiment shown in Figure 4 includes  rmal hydraulic engine 33..  Solar panels 3i provide  heat that heats  working fluid  tha engine.   heated water n travels to a series cf vajvet' 37, 39, 41, and 43.  number of valves may depend upon  number of cylindex's in <br>
engine,  number of heat exchangers, and how  water is distributed to  heat exchangers and cylinders, among or factors.<br>
 valves 37, 39, 41, and 43 deliver  water to heat exchanger(s) 45.   heated water n heats  working fluid in  engine 33.  After delivering its heat to working fluid,  heated water is directed through valves 47, 49, 51, and 53 and n back to  solar array 35.<br>
A circulating pump 55 drives  flow of  heated water.   circulation pump 55 may be powered by electricity generated by photovoltaic cells (not shown).<br>
 rmal hydraulic engine 33 may be connected to transmission 57.  In this embodiment,  engine 33 drives a pump 59.   pump 59 may be utilized to pump water from a water source 61.   water source 61 may include a well, reservoir, or tank, among or sources.   water may be pumped from  water source 61 into a water storage pipeline 63.<br>
Water from  water source 61 may be utilized as source of cooling water for cooling  working fluid as well as a source of water to be heated to provide heat to working fluid.  Water for eir function may be stored in a storage tank 63.<br>
components of  engine according to  present invention may mounted on a frame.  Figure 21 shows an embodiment of a rmal hydraulic engine according to present invention that includes four cylinders wherein components of  engine are mounted to a frame A.<br>
To simplify  explanation of  operation of present invention,  functioning of a three cylinder engine according to  present invention will be described.  Figure 5 shows an example of such an embodiment.   working fluid is contained within  cylinder and  working fluid container is surrounded by  heat exchanger.  refore, in a sense,  heat exchanger acts as a containment system.<br>
Given  fact that re are three cylinders 67, 69, and 71 and three pistons 73, 75, and 77 in  embodiment described here, each piston preferably powers  crank shaft 79 about a rotation of at least 120°, so that one piston is always in operation powering  crank shaft rotation.  operation of  engine will be described with  assumption that one piston will be starting its power stroke.<br>
To begin  power stroke,  working fluid must be heated.   embodiment shown in Figure 5 includes three heat exchangers 132, 136, and 138 to introduce heat to and remove heat from  working fluid.   difference between working fluid in a heated state and a cool state may vary, depending upon  embodiment.  According to one embodiment,<br>
difference between  high temperature of  working fluid and  low temperature of  working fluid is about 4060°F.  However,  differential between  high and low temperatures of  working fluid may be larger or smaller.<br>
 high temperature of  working fluid may be anywhere from about 80200°F.   range of temperatures of  high temperature of  working fluid may also be from about 120 140°.  However, any temperature for  high temperature of  working fluid could be utilized as long as it is higher than  lower temperature of  working fluid.  In fact, superheated water above 212°F could also be utilized.<br>
 low temperature of  working fluid could vary from about 35°F to about 85°F.  According to one embodiment  low temperature may be from about 70° to about 85°F.  However, as stated above regarding  high temperature,  low temperature of  working fluid may be any temperature, as long as it is lower than  high temperature of  working fluid.   greater  differential in  high and low temperatures,  greater  possibility for heating cooling  working fluid.<br>
 temperature of  working fluid may also be defined by defining  highest temperature of  working fluid relative to  lowest temperature of  working fluid. Accordingly,  difference in temperatures of  working fluid may be up to about 60°C.  Alternatively,  difference<br>
in temperatures of  working fluid may be between about 60°C and about 120°C.  Or ranges for  difference in temperatures of  working fluid include between about 120°C and about 180°C and between about 180°C and about 240°C.<br>
Prior to starting  operation of  engine, working fluid may be pressurized to help maintain a seal between  piston and  wall of  cylinder.  A positive pressure maintained in  cylinder may help to force a seal in  area between  piston and  cylinder.  For example,  working fluid could be prepressurized to about 200 Ibs. per square inch.  If  working fluid is prepressurized, it may be pressurized to an extent such that during contraction of  working fluid as heat is removed from working fluid,  pressure within  cylinder never drops below 0.  However, it is not necessary that  working fluid be prepressurized at all.<br>
Figure 10 represents a graph showing  operating range of temperatures and pressures that an embodiment of a rmal hydraulic engine utilizing a working fluid.<br>
As  working fluid is heated and it starts to expand,  force of  fluid is transmitted to  piston, reby moving  piston.  According to one embodiment of  present invention including three cylinders,  rotation of  crank shaft does not begin until  connecting rod 174 has moved to a point about 20° past top dead center as shown in Figure 8.<br>
As stated above, in a three cylinder embodiment, piston must power  crank shaft around at least 120° since re are three pistons and 360° in a complete rotation of crank shaft.  Similarly, in a four cylinder engine, each piston must power  crank shaft about 90°.  corresponding number of degrees that  piston must power crank shaft rotation may be calculated simply by dividing 360° by  number of pistons.<br>
Given  fact that  rotation of  crank does not commence until  connecting rod has moved about 20° beyond top dead center,  calculation of  120° of  power stroke of  piston will be calculated from this 20° starting point of  rotation.  However,  power stroke of  next piston will be started upon  connecting rod reaching 120° beyond top dead center.  refore, re will a 20° overlap between  power stroke of  first cylinder and  second cylinder.  This will help to ensure a smooth transition between pistons with  effective turning force being transmitted to and from  crank shaft being maintained thoroughly constant.   smooth transition of power is assisted by  fact that as any piston is traveling through its power stroke, it not only powers  rotation of  crank shaft or or device that harnesses  movement of piston but it may also help to drive  or pistons in engine on ir return stroke.<br>
As shown in Figure 9,  heat source associated with first cylinder preferably is cut off when  connecting rod reaThes about 120° beyond top dead center, according to this embodiment.  Next,  source of cool fluid is started into  heat exchanger when  connecting rod reaThes about 140° beyond top dead center.  As  return stroke of  first piston continues and  rotation of  connecting rod and crank shaft continue, when  connecting rod reaThes about 300° beyond top dead center,  source of cold fluid to heat is turned off and  source of high temperature fluid to  heat exchanger is started again.<br>
 points at which  sources of high and low temperature fluid are introduced into  heat exchanger may vary, depending upon  embodiment of  invention.  One factor that may alter  flow of  high and low temperature fluid into  exchanger is wher or not  working fluid is prepressurized as described above.   speed of movement of  piston and, hence,  crank shaft may be increased by increasing  flow of high temperature fluid into  heat exchanger.   speed of operation of  engine and  horsepower output may also be increased by increasing  temperature differential between high and low temperature fluids introduced into  heat exchanger and, hence working fluid.<br>
At  300° rotation point, when  source of high temperature fluid is reintroduced into  heat exchanger, <br>
working fluid has come back to its base temperature pressure and volume.  It is se volume, temperature and pressure parameters that are utilized to calculate  engine size, flow of high and low temperature fluid to  heat exchanger, engine load, cylinder size, cylinder number, and many or operating and design parameters of  invention. .<br>
 flow of high and low temperature fluid into  heat exchanger described above may be controlled in a variety of ways.  For instance, a timing gear may be directly or indirectly connected to  crank shaft.   timing gear may n mechanically actuate valves that control  flow of high and low temperature fluid into  heat exchanger based upon  position of  crank shaft.  Alternatively, a cam shaft rotated by  crank shaft may operate an electrical system that electrically controls  flow of high and low temperature fluid into  heat exchanger.<br>
Or methods that may be utilized to control  flow of high and low temperature fluid into  heat exchanger can include lasers, computer programs, optical devices, mechanical push rods, connecting rods, levers, or or manual and/or automatic devices.  As will be appreciated, a complex computer control could optimize  operation of a rmal hydraulic engine according to  embodiment, just as electronic control has helped to optimize  operation of internal combustion engines in modern automobiles.  A complex electronic control<br>
system can simultaneously monitor and control a wide variety of parameters, optimizing .operation of  engine.<br>
As stated above,  rmal hydraulic engine of present invention may include a mechanical valve for directing  flow of working fluid and or fluids.  Fig. 31 shows one example of a rotating valve that may be utilized to direct flow of coolant and/or working fluid in a rmal hydraulic engine according to  present invention.   valve shown in Fig. 31 includes a connector 560 connected to a valve body 562.   valve body houses a valve rotor 564 that rotates within  valve body.  Valve rotor 564 includes a plurality of outlets 566, 568, 570, and 572.  Valve body 562 may be connected to an anchor block 574 or or structure to anchor  valve.   valve body and valve rotor may be kept by a cap 576.  Valve body 562 also includes outlets 578, 580, 582, and 584.  Outlets 578, 580, 582, and 584 are connected to outlet pipes 586, 588, 590, and 592.  Valve body outlets 578, 580, 582, 584 are also aligned with rotor valve outlets 566, 568, 570, 572, such that as  valve rotor rotates and outlets 566, 568, 570, and 572 are aligned with  valve body outlets 578, 580, 582, and 584, coolant, working fluid, or or fluids will flow to  desired location.<br>
 valve rotor 564 may be turned through  geared operation of a timing chain connected to  main shaft of crankshaft.   embodiment shown in Fig. 31 includes sprockets for connecting to  timing chain.<br>
Rar than rotating valve, flow of fluids in  present invention may be controlled mechanically with  use of or types of valves, including cam/pushrod/rocker arm time mechanisms.   flow of fluids may also be controlled with an electric solenoid valve.  Any or valve may also be utilized to direct  flow of fluids in  present invention. Additionally, a rotating valve such as that shown in Figure 31 may be included in any engine according to  present invention.<br>
 rmal hydraulic engine according to  present invention may include an engine cranking system with pistons operating independently of each or.  In typical inline, Vtype, or radially designed engines, each piston is mechanically connected to each of  or pistons.  Internal combustion engines use this mechanical reliance to push exhaust gases out of.  engine, pull fresh gas into piston chamber, and pressurize gas prior to combustion. However, less mechanical reliance may be required in a rmal hydraulic engine according to  present invention.  For example, if  cylinders include two ports, mechanical interconnection of all pistons may not be necessary.  return of  piston in such systems is typically accomplished mostly by pressurization of  opposite side of  piston. This return mechanism also supplies crankshaft drive power.<br>
 present invention may utilize a crankshaft that can be turned by a free releasing arm mechanism that is able to<br>
slide freely around  crankshaft in a return direction, lock onto  crankshaft in a forward or power direction.  Figs. 3235 show an example of such a crankshaft.   crankshaft shown in Figs. 3235 includes a ratThettype mechanism.  shaft shown in Figs. 3235 can be used in conjunction with multiple crank arms to provide a continuously turning shaft.<br>
Fig. 32 shows a crank arm 587 connected to a crankshaft 589.   crankshaft 589 includes an indentation 591 that receives a portion of  crank arm 587.  As can be seen in Fig. 32, crank arm 587 will cause a rotation of shaft 589 up until  point that crank arm 587 slips out of recess 591. Preferably, crank arm 587 will no longer engage recess 591 at a point substantially near  end of  power stroke of a piston connected to crank arm 587 so that  power of piston is substantially and entirely communicated to crankshaft 589.   crank arm 587 will n ride along a surface of  crankshaft 589 as  piston is on its return stroke.  As  piston again begins its power stroke, crank arm 587 will n start to travel back along  surface of  crankshaft until it engages a recess.<br>
Fig. 33 shows an embodiment of a ratThettype crankshaft illustrating  position of a crank arm throughout a power cycle of a piston.  Fig. 34 represents an embodiment of a cylinder, crank arm, and crankshaft including a ratThettype movement mechanism.  Fig. 34 also illustrates  various positions of  crank arm during  movement of  piston.<br>
Fig. 35 shows anor embodiment of a crank arm and<br>
crankshaft utilizing a ratThettype mechanism.  Fig. 36 shows<br>
a crank moment arm that includes stiffening ribs 599 to<br>
reinforce  crank moment arm so furr ensure that it can<br>
withstand  great pressures generated by  present<br>
invention.	. '<br>
Rar relying upon heat exchangers, heat may be imparted to  working fluid directly.  An example of an embodiment of a rmal hydraulic engine according to  present invention that includes direct transmission of heat to  working fluid is shown in Fig. 27.   embodiment shown in Fig. 27 includes four radially arranged cylinders.   engine includes a centrally located rotating valve 360 to which each cylinder is connected.  Each cylinder is also connected to a working fluid reservoir to which heat is directly imparted.<br>
Directly heating  working fluid does not utilize a heat exchanger and it does not use  heated liquid to transfer heat from a heat source to  working fluid.  direct transfer method directly heats  working fluid with  heat source.  As can be appreciated, re is no loss of heat associated with  use of heat exchangers.<br>
Fig. 28 provides an example of an embodiment of a working fluid container that may be utilized in a rmal hydraulic engine utilizing direct heat transfer.   working fluid container or reservoir shown in Fig. 28 includes an elongated<br>
tube 348.  Although  working	fluid container may have any<br>
desired shape, it may include a	large amount of surface area<br>
relative to  volume so as to	increase  rate of heat<br>
transfer to  working fluid.<br>
 embodiment of  working fluid container shown in Fig. 28 includes a 20 ft. long pipe that is 4 inThes in diameter made of "SThedule 80" pipe.   pipe may include an assembly 350 for joining  pipe to conduit for connecting  working fluid reservoir to  cylinder.  Fig. 29 shows an end view of  pipe, shown in Fig. 28, showing a flange 352. Flange 352 may include a plurality of holes 354 for utilizing bolts 356 to connect  flange to anor flange for connecting to a conduit for connecting to  cylinder.<br>
 embodiment of  working fluid reservoir shown in Figs. 27 and 28 also includes cooling element 358 inserted into  pipe 348.  A cooling fluid may be introduced into conduit 358 to cool  working fluid.   conduit 358 may be interconnected with  rotating valve 360 for directing cooling fluid to  relevant working fluid reservoir.<br>
In order to accommodate high pressures inherent in some working fluids,  cooling fluid conduit 356 preferably is made of a material capable of withstanding  high pressures. According to one embodiment, 3A inch high pressure steel pipeline is utilized.  Although  pressure of  working fluid may be high,  pressure of  coolant may be low, for<br>
example, in one embodiment,  pressure of  coolant was from about 32 to about 80 psi.<br>
Fig. 30 shows a closeup crosssectional view of a connection between  working fluid reservoir,  coolant conduit 359, flanges 352 and 353, gasket 355, and bolts 357.<br>
In  embodiment shown in Fig. 27, each of  working fluid reservoirs 362, 364, 366, 368 is placed within a parabolic solar heat collector 370, 372, 374, and 376, respectively.   solar heat collector imparts heat to working fluid.  As  working fluid expands, it powers cylinders.<br>
, At  appropriate time, rotating valve 360 directs coolant into each of  working fluid reservoirs.  As coolant is circulated through  working fluid reservoirs, it is heated.   heated coolant is directed to a hotcold separator 378.  To augment  heat imparted to  working fluid by  solar heat collectors,  present invention may direct heated coolant through  coolant conduit 356.  Hot cold separator 378 preferably separates flow of coolant from working fluid reservoirs undergoing expansion from coolant exiting working fluid cylinders undergoing contraction.<br>
Heat may be withdrawn from coolant in heat exchanger 380. Heat from coolant may be stored in heat storage device 382.<br>
Flow of coolant may be controlled by a plurality of pumps.   embodiment shown in Fig. 27 includes an hydraulic motor coolant pump 384 for directing coolant from  heat exchanger 380 to rotating valve 360.   hydraulic motor coolant 384 may be driven by  rmal hydraulic engine.<br>
 present invention may also include hydraulic motor heat recycle pump 386.  Hydraulic motor heat recycle pump 386 may pump coolant from heat storage device 382 to  rotating valve 360.  Hydraulic motor heat recycle pump 386 may also be driven by  rmal hydraulic engine.<br>
 embodiment of  rmal hydraulic engine shown in Fig. 27 is shown being utilized to drive a hydraulic pump (not shown).  Conduits 390 and 392 are for directing hydraulic fluid from  hydraulic pump operated by  rmal hydraulic engine to various loads that are desired to be driven by  rmal hydraulic engine.  As stated above, in  embodiment shown in Fig. 27, hydraulic motor coolant pump 384, hydraulic motor heat recycle pump 386, and water pump 388 are driven by  rmal hydraulic engine.  Arrows on lines 390 and 392 indicate  direction of flow of hydraulic fluid to  loads.<br>
Operation of heat exchanger 380 may be enhanced by pumping water in conduits 394 and 396 into, respectively, water pumped by water pump 388.<br>
A rmal hydraulic engine according to  present invention may be built in any size.  For example, very small engines for use in applications such as biomechanical applications, to large megawatt power plants may incorporate  rmal hydraulic engine of  present invention. In fact, tne rmal hydraulic engine can be designed for use in any application that requires  power of mechanical energy.<br>
A very small engine could include pistons about 0.5 cm to about 1 cm in diameter.  Such an engine could include working fluid reservoirs about  size of a typical body rmometer. In fact, such engines could utilize heat at about typical human body temperature as a heat source.  Cooling could be provided by an external evaporative system.  Such an engine could be used in  human or or body.  One example of a use for such an engine is as a heart pump.  Anor example of an application is for hormone injection.  For example, such an engine could be used for people with a failed lymphatic system.  Such an engine could provide, for example, from about 0.01 horsepower to about 0.1 horsepower.<br>
On  or end of  spectrum, very large engines could be built within  scope of  present invention.  For example, an engine that could generate about 350 million horsepower could provide about 500 megawatt electric generating capabilities.  Such an engine could utilize a piston having a diameter of about 48 inThes to about 9o<br>
inThes.   engine could be built in a heavily reinforced concrete and steel structure.<br>
An engine capable of pumping water could generate from about 10, about 50, about 200 horsepower or anywhere in between.<br>

Heat to expand  working fluid is provided by a parabolic solar heat collector 400;  solar collector preferably includes a drive 402 for tracking movement of  sun.   working fluid is delivered to engine 406.  Power produced by engine 406 is transmitted by transmission 408'to pump 409.   invention may include control 410 for controlling flow of coolant.   engine may also include battery 412 for providing power.<br>
