The invention relates to a wiper device, wiper arm and wiper blade, in particular for windows of motor vehicles.<br>
Numerous wiper devices of this type are already known. They have a wiper arm with is formed by a U-shaped profiled section. The limb which, in the installed position, faces in the direction of travel of the vehicle forms an integrated spoiler, and air outflow openings are arranged on the further limb and/or on the spine. A wiper arm of this type is shown, for example, in FR 2 632 897.<br>
However, the spoiler and the air outflow opening are unable to prevent lifting forces from being generated at relatively high driving speeds of the motor vehicle, and these forces counteract the bearing force by which the wiper blade secured to the wiper arm is pressed onto the window.<br>
Advantages of the invention<br>
The wiper device according to the invention having the features as described herein has the advantage that air-guidance elements which are arranged in the inner region of the profiled section are used to generate an advantageous flow profile of the slipstream preferably along the width of the wiper arm, which on the one hand effectively increases the bearing force of the wiper arm at high speeds and at the same time eliminates disruptive wind noise, but on the other hand does not create any visual interference or significantly increase the costs of the wiper arm.<br>
The measures which are described herein result in advantageous refinements and improvements.<br><br>
If the air outflow openings are arranged in the rear limb, which is remote from the spoiler, of the U-shaped profiled section, they can only be seen from the vehicle interior yet nevertheless can be made sufficiently large to generate sufficient negative lift and therefore a sufficient bearing force.<br>
It is particularly advantageous if an air-guidance element projects beyond the limbs of the U-shaped profiled section, since in this way sufficient air to generate the negative lift can enter the wiper arm. This is true in particular if the air-guidance elements are arranged in such a manner that, in the region of the lower spoiler edge, they form a funnel-shaped inlet.<br>
Furthermore, it is advantageous if the projecting air-guidance element has a soft rubber lip, in order to avoid damage or noise in the event of possible contact between vehicle window and air-guidance element. This allows a particularly short distance from the vehicle window to be achieved, with the result that an even more favorable flow profile is achieved.<br>
If the air-guidance elements are arranged in such a way that the cross section of flow in the inflow region is smaller than in the outflow region, an optimum sucking action is achieved by the slipstream.<br>
If, in the installed position, the air-guidance elements are closer to the window in the inflow region<br><br>
than in the outflow region, this effect can be intensified still further.<br>
An optimum flow profile is achieved if the air-guidance elements are arranged in such a way that the air flowing through is accelerated, so that a light sucking action in the direction of the window is generated. Particularly at high speeds, this effect, which is similar to that of an airfoil, considerably improves the wiping result.<br>
Furthermore, it is advantageous for at least one air outflow opening to be arranged in the central limb of the U-shaped profiled section, since in this way the cross section of flow in the outflow region can be increased further.<br>
If an air outflow opening is arranged in the limb which is remote from the spoiler and a further air outflow opening is arranged in the middle limb, it is possible to produce virtually any desired flow profile within the U-shaped profiled section and therefore within the wiper arm.<br>
If, furthermore, the air-guidance elements are designed as injection moldings, they can be produced at low cost and only marginally increase the weight of the wiper device. Furthermore, these injection moldings can easily be replaced even in the event of them being destroyed-<br>
It is particularly advantageous if the air-guidance elements are clipped into the profiled section, in order to be able to complete rapid installation and rapid changing if, for example, damage has occurred.<br>
Furthermore, it is advantageous for the air-guidance element  to be adhesively bonded  into  the profiled<br><br>
section, in order to obtain a positively locking and smooth connection and, in this way, to avoid disruptive noise.<br>
It is particularly advantageous if the air-guidance element has a shoulder for guiding the wiper blade, with the result that the relative position of the wiper blade with respect to the air-guidance element is always optimally maintained.<br>
It is particularly advantageous if the wiper blade is designed as a flat-bar wiper blade. In this way, the overall height between wiper arm, spoiler and wiper blade is reduced to a minimum, since there is no need for any complex bracket structure, which is disadvantageous in terms of flow, between the wiper blade and profiled section.<br>
Furthermore, it is advantageous if a passage which is in the form of a funnel or a double funnel is formed by the air-guidance elements, in order to achieve an optimum flow profile. In the case of the passage in the form of a double funnel, the air inflow openings and the air outflow openings are larger than the center of the passage.<br>
The inventive wiper arm has the advantage that, on account of the arrangement of an air-guidance element in the inner region of the U-shaped profiled section, an advantageous flow profile is produced in particular at high flow velocities.<br>
It is to be considered advantageous in this context if at least one air-guidance element is supported by the wiper blade itself and is secured thereto. This results in flow onto the wiper blade itself, generating an additional bearing force which presses the wiper blade onto the window.<br><br>
It is particularly advantageous if the profiled section, in the region of its front limb, has a leading opening, in which an air-guidance element supported by the wiper blade is accomodated. In this way, the spoiler of the wiper blade/wiper arm combination is formed to an equal extent by the wiper blade and by the wiper arm, resulting in a more uniform distribution of bearing force.<br>
This is particularly advantageous if the air-guidance elements supported by the wiper blade end approximately flush with the front limb, so that a substantially planar spoiler surface is formed.<br>
To increase stability, in particular with respect to torsion, it is, furthermore, advantageous for a plurality of leading openings to be provided along the longitudinal extent of the wiper arm. In this way, webs which improve the rigidity of the wiper arm are formed between the leading openings.<br>
It is particularly advantageous for nozzles to be provided in the interior of the profiled section for discharging cleaning fluid. Particularly in the region of the rear limb, in which the nozzles cause little disturbance to the airflow through the air-guidance elements mounted in front of them, it is even possible for relatively large, for example heatable nozzles to be provided.<br>
A wiper blade according to the invention has the advantage that, because the blade spine bears at least one air-guidance element, which interacts with an upper air-guidance element arranged on or in the wiper blade, it is possible to achieve optimum leading-flow conditions.   In particular,   the direct flow onto the wiper blade means<br><br>
that not only is the latter pressed indirectly onto the window via the wiper arm, but also the wiper blade itself is pressed onto the window.<br>
In this context, it is particularly advantageous if the lower air-guidance element, which is supported by the blade spine, is able to pass through the profiled section of the wiper arm, in particular through its front limb. In this way, it is possible to achieve a planar spoiler surface at the front limb of the profiled section yet nevertheless to allow direct flow onto the wiper blade.<br>
It is in this case particularly advantageous if the wiper blade bears a plurality of air-guidance elements along a longitudinal extent, since in this way the stability of the wiper arm is not restricted.<br>

Description of the exemplary embodiments<br>
Figure 1 shows a perspective view of a wiper device 10. This device has a motor 12 which, via a linkage 14, drives two wiper arms 16 which, at their ends, each bear a wiper blade 18. The wiper blade 18 is secured to the wiper arm 16, approximately parallel to the longitudinal extent thereof, and is partially surrounded by the wiper arm 16. Naturally, it is also possible for the wiper blade 18 to be completely surrounded by the wiper arm 16. The wiper blade 18 is in this case designed as a flat-bar wiper blade.<br>
The wiper device 10, as part of a motor vehicle, is secured to the body of the vehicle and enables the wiper blades 18 to slide over the windshield 20. When the motor vehicle is driving, the slipstream causes an airflow, which is indicated by the flow arrows 22.<br>
Figure 2 shows a perspective view of a wiper arm 16 of a wiper device 10 according to the invention. The incoming airflow direction is in this case once again illustrated by the flow arrow 22. The wiper arm 16 substantially comprises a U-shaped profiled section 26, which, on the side which faces the airflow, is beveled to form a spoiler. Securing elements 24, in particular hooks and/or eyelets, for securing to the linkage 14 and to the wiper blade 18 are arranged at the ends of its longitudinal extent. On the side which is remote<br><br>
from the airflow, there are air outflow openings 40, which are separated from one another by webs 25. Air-guidance elements 36, 38 are clipped into an inner region 34 of the profiled section 26 as an integral injection molding, as illustrated in the drawing by-means of dashed lines.<br>
This injection molding is illustrated in more detail, in cross section, in Figures 3 to 8.<br>
Along its longitudinal extent, side walls 29, which continue the individual air outflow openings 40 of the profiled section 26 in the interior of the air-guidance elements 36, 38, are arranged between the upper and lower air-guidance elements 36, 38. On the side which faces the flow, these side walls 29 are combined in pairs and prevent turbulent flow at the webs 25 arranged between the air outflow openings 40. Furthermore, they increase the stability of the injection molding.<br>
Figure 3 illustrates a cross section through the wiper arm from Figure 2. The profiled section 26 of the wiper arm 16 has a spine 30, from which the two limbs extend laterally. The limb which faces the airflow is referred to below as the front limb 28, and the limb which is remote from the airflow is referred to below as the rear limb 32. The flow of air is in this case too indicated by the flow arrow 22.<br>
Air-guidance elements 36, 38 are arranged in the inner region 34 of the U-shaped profiled section 26 and in some cases also project beyond the inner region 34 of the profiled section 26. A wiper blade 18, which is designed as a flat-bar wiper blade, is illustrated beneath the profiled section 26. Air can flow out of the inner region 34 of the profiled section 26 through the air outflow openings 40 arranged in its limb 32 which is remote from the flow.<br><br>
The upper air-guidance element 36 is arranged in such a way that it extends from the lower edge of the front limb 28, facing the windshield 20, to the upper edge of the air outflow opening 40. The lower air-guidance element 3 8 projects from the lower edge of the air outflow opening 40, beyond the wiper blade 18, in the manner of an airfoil, beyond the profiled section 26, so that a funnel-like air inflow opening 42 is formed. As a result, a nozzle effect, which increases the bearing force by which the wiper arm 16 presses the wiper blade 18 onto the window 20, is formed between the air inflow opening 42 and air outflow opening 40. At their end, the air-guidance elements 36, 38 are flush adjacent to the air outflow openings, so that as little turbulence as possible is formed in this region.<br>
As illustrated in Figure 4, the air-guidance elements 36, 38 may also be formed in such a way that, in the region of the edges of the air outflow opening 40, they form a smooth, rounded transition with the further limbs 30, 32.<br>
The front 1 imb 28, which forms the spoiler, may in this case be convex or, as shown here, concave.<br>
Figure 5 illustrates how the lower air-guidance element 38 has a flow element 44 which extends from the underside of the lower air-guidance element 38 to the lower edge of the rear limb 32, in order to avoid unfavorable flow properties, such as turbulence, in this region without the flow to the air outflow opening 40 being impaired. Naturally, on its rear side the lower air-guidance element 3 8 may also be formed in such a way that there is no cavity formed between the flow element 44 and air outflow opening 40.<br>
In Figure  6,  the lower air-guidance element 38  is<br><br>
lengthened, on its side which faces the flow, by means of a soft rubber lip 46. This rubber lip 46 is injection-molded onto the lower air-guidance element by means of a shoulder 48, for example in a multicomponent injection-molding process. The rubber lip 46 is oriented approximately perpendicular to the windshield 2 0 and approximately parallel to the center axis of the wiper blade 18, but may also have a knee 52 and its cross section may taper downward.<br>
Figure 7a shows a variant of a wiper arm according to the invention. On its side which faces the flow, the U-shaped profiled section 26 is curved concavely, the lower edge of the front limb 28 lying closer to the windshield 20 than that end of the lower air-guidance element 3 8 which faces the flow and the lower edge of the rear limb 32. The air outflow opening 40 is in this case arranged in the spine 30, and accordingly the two air-guidance elements 36, 3 8 are guided in the direction of the spine 30.<br>
Furthermore, Figure 7a shows a parallelogram of forces, as is formed by the inner air-guidance elements (36, 38) . As a result of the acceleration, air, which flows through the air-guidance elements (36, 38) which are designed as a funnel-shaped passage, a normal force (FN) acts perpendicular to the surface of the lower air-guidance element (38) . This force can be broken down into a compressive force (FD), which presses the wiper blade (18) toward the window (20), and a horizontal force (FH), which pushes the wiper blade (18) over the window (20).<br>
As illustrated in Figure 7b, the lower air-guidance element 38 may be arranged in the inner region 34 of the profiled section 26 in such a way that the wiper blade 18 is partially covered in terms of flow, so that only a small amount of air flows through the region 54<br><br>
over the wiper blade 18.<br>
Figure 8a shows a variation of the exemplary embodiment shown in Figure 7a. In addition to the air outflow opening 40 in the spine 30, there is a further air outflow opening 40 in the rear limb 32. To prevent turbulence between upper and lower air-guidance elements 36, 38 in the region of the outflow openings 40, a center wedge 56, which is responsible for a laminar flow profile in the direction of the two air outflow openings 40, is arranged between the two openings. This center wedge 56 is designed as an approximately triangular wedge, the foot of which extends from the upper edge of the rear air outflow opening 40 to the rear edge of the upper air outflow opening 40, arranged in the spine 30, and ends flush with these edges.<br>
Figure 8b illustrates a further variant. As in Figure 8a, the wiper arm 16 has two air outflow openings 40, but the lower air-guidance element 38, as is also the case in Figure 3, projects beyond the edge of the front limb 28, so that the wiper blade 18 is almost completely covered by the lower air-guidance element 38 and forms a funnel-like air inflow opening 42.<br>
Figure 9 shows a perspective view of a wiper blade 18 according to the invention. In this case, the lower air-guidance elements 38 are secured not to the wiper arm 16 but to the wiper blade 18.<br>
As has already been illustrated in Figure 8b, the wiper blade 18 substantially comprises a wiper rubber 58, the blade spine 60 of which is reinforced by means of a spring bar 62. The lower air-guidance elements 38 are secured, for example clipped, to the spring bar 62. In principle, they may also be secured to the wiper rubber<br><br>
58, in the region of the blade spine 60, or may be formed integrally from the wiper rubber 58 in the extruder. Moreover, it is conceivable to dispense with the spring bar 62. This can be achieved, for example, by using a suitable rubber mix in the region of the blade spine 60 of the wiper rubber 58.<br>
Figure 10 shows the lower air-guidance element 38 and how it is clipped to the spring bar 62. This air-guidance element 38 comprises a plate, on which wedge-shaped protuberances 64, which taper to a point in the opposite direction to the direction of flow, are arranged. The side walls 29 of the wedge-shaped protuberances 64 are shaped in such a way that an optimum flow profile of the incoming air in the direction of the air outflow openings 4 0 of the wiper arm 60 is produced.<br>
Figure 11 illustrates a cross section through an air-guidance element 38 of this type with a wiper arm 16. The air-guidance element 38 is clipped onto the spring bar 62 in the region of the blade spine 60 of the wiper rubber 58 by means of clip elements 62. Naturally, the air-guidance element 38 may also be secured to the blade spine 60 by means of adhesive bonding, latching or ultrasonic stamping. The section illustrated here is arranged in the region of the air outflow opening 40, as shown in Figure 10.<br>
On that edge of the air outflow opening 4 0 which faces the wiper blade, the air-guidance element 3 8 has a separation edge 66 in order to improve the flow profile. As a result, the slipstream flow is separated at the wiper blade 18 and not at the wiper arm 16, which prevents the wiper blade 18 from lifting off.<br>
Figure  12  shows  the  same  cross  section  as  that illustrated in Figure 11, but in a region in which the<br><br>
wiper arm 18 does not have an air outflow opening 40. In this case, the air-guidance element 38 extends as far as the spine 3 0 and breaks up the airflow through the side walls 29, so that the flow can escape through the air outflow openings 40.<br>
Figure 13 shows a variant on the arrangement shown in Figure 11. The air outflow opening 40 is located in the region of the spine 3 0 of the wiper arm 16, and the lower air-guidance element 38 is shaped in such a way that the airflow of the slipstream is diverted toward the air outflow opening 40 in the spine 30.<br>
Figure 14 shows, in a corresponding way, the region without an air outflow opening 40 of the wiper arm. In this case, the air-guidance element 38 is of substantially box-shaped design and closes off the interior of the wiper arm 16.<br>
Figure 15 shows a development of the arrangement shown in Figure 11. In addition to the lower air-guidance element 38, which is secured to the wiper blade 18, in this case an upper air-guidance element 3 6 is secured in the wiper arm 16. This can be achieved, for example, by means of a clip connection. In this way, the airflow is diverted more successfully and with less turbulence toward the air outflow opening 40.<br>
Fi gur e 16 shows the wiper arm 16 wi th the upper air-guidance element 36 for the region in which there is no air outflow opening 40. The upper air-guidance element 38 has been shifted downward, toward the wiper blade 18, and is almost in contact with the upper edge of the lower air-guidance element 36, which is raised at this point and divides the flow toward the sides.<br>
Figure 17 shows a perspective view of a further variant on the wiper arm 16 according to the invention with a<br><br>
wiper blade 18.<br>
The wiper arm 16 substantially comprises a substantially U-shaped profiled section 26, on which the wiper blade 18 can be articulatedly mounted. In the region of its blade spine 60, the wiper blade 18 has air-guidance elements 38, which are formed in such a way as to penetrate into the interior of the profiled section 2 6 when the wiper arm 16 is connected to the wiper blade 18. To increase the bearing force by which the wiper blade 18 is pressed onto the window 20, the front limb 28 of the profiled section 26 has leading openings 70, into which the air-guidance elements 38 of the wiper blade 18 penetrate in the assembled position, and forms a substantially smooth surface with the front limb 28. This is illustrated in Figure 18.<br>
The height of the lower air-guidance elements 38, which are secured to the wiper blade 18, is determined by the geometry of the wiper arm 16. Typically, the inner height H, in the region of that end of the wiper blade 18 which is covered by the wiper arm 16, is greater than the outer height h in the region where the wiper blade 18 is secured to the wiper arm 16 or even the edge height h' at that end of the wiper blade 18 which is remote from the wiper arm 16.<br>
Figure 19, then, shows a section through the wiper arm 16 with the air-guidance element 38 from Figure 18. In the region of its front limb 28, the wiper arm 16 has the leading opening 70. The air-guidance element 38, which is secured in the region of the blade spine 60, passes into this leading opening 70, so that a substantially planar surface is formed.<br>
For this purpose, the lower air-guidance element 38 is designed substantially in the form of an inverted V. On its side which faces the flow, the air-guidance element<br><br>
38 has a knee 72, which is adjoined by a leg 74. The clip element 68 which connects the air-guidance element 38 to the spring bar 62 of the blade spine 60 is then arranged on this leg. The leg 74 results in a smooth profile between front limb 28 and the leading surface of the air-guidance element 38.<br>
The wiper blade 18 can move in the vertical direction within the profiled section 26 of the wiper arm 16, in order to compensate for different geometries of the windshield 20, To allow this lifting movement to take place, the leading opening 70 of the wiper arm 16 extends beyond the spine 30 of the profiled section 26. This is illustrated once again in Figure 20.<br>
Figures 21a and 21b show a variant of the invention. In the stability regions, between the leading openings 70, the wiper arm 16 may also be of flat design and, in cross section, may extend approximately parallel or with only a slight convexity with respect to the blade spine 60 (Figure 21b) . In this design, the air-guidance elements 38 then, along the longitudinal extent of the wiper arm 16, project out of the wiper arm 16 in the manner of a comb or teeth (Figure 21a).<br>
Figure 21 shows the region of the wiper arm 16 in which there is no leading opening 70. In this region, the air-guidance element 38 is reduced, i.e. is designed simply as a plate which is arranged approximately parallel to the spring bar 60 and is merely used to stabilize the system.<br>
In this region, a cavity 76, which is suitable for the arrangement of nozzles 78 through which cleaning fluid can be sprayed onto the windshield 20, is formed inside the wiper arm. This is illustrated in Figure 22.<br>
The nozzles 78 may, as illustrated in Figure 22, either<br><br>
spray directly out of the wiper arm 16 or, as illustrated in Figure 23, spray onto the windshield 20 through a spray opening 80.
