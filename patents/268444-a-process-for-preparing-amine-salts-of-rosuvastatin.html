FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to salts of HMG CoA reductase inhibitors and in particular, crystalline rosuvastatin amine salts represented by Formula I<br><br>
wherein R1, R2, R-3, R4 independently represent hydrogen, straight or branched chain C1-15 alkyl, cycloalkyl, optionally substituted aryl, aralkyl, heterocycloalkyl, a heterocyclic residue containing one or more hetero atoms.<br>
The present invention also relates to conversion of salt of Formula I to Rosuvastatin calcium of Formula II<br><br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Rosuvastatin is chemically known as (3R,5S,6E)-7-[4-(4-fluorophenyl)-6-(l-methylethyl)-2-[methyl(methylsulfonyl)amino-5-pyrimidinyl]-3,5-dihydroxy-6-heptenoic acid, is a synthetic lipid-lowering agent, which is an inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-<br><br>
COA) reductase. This enzyme catalyzes the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonate, an early and rate-limiting step in cholesterol biosynthesis.<br>
US RE 37,314 discloses an amorphous form of the calcium salt of rosuvastatin and the sodium salt is obtained therein as powdery crystals. The calcium salt of rosuvastatin is presently available in the market as CRESTOR. Further, this patent describes the preparation of calcium salt of rosuvastatin by dissolving the corresponding sodium salt in water and adding calcium chloride and collecting the resultant precipitate by filtration.<br>
WO 01/60804 describes the preparation of crystalline rosuvastatin salts, namely, ammonium,<br>
methylammonium,	ethylammonium,	diethanolammonium,	tri(hydroxymethyl)-<br>
methylammonium, benzylammonium, 4-methoxybenzylammonium, lithium and magnesium salts respectively. This patent publication also describes a process for the preparation of all these salts.<br>
WO 2005/077916 Al discloses various amine salts of rosuvastatin comprising cyclohexyl ammonium salt, diisopropyl ammonium salt, isopropyl ammonium salt, dicyclohexyl ammonium salt and (S) (+)-methylbenzyl ammonium salts.<br>
US 6,838,566 also describes novel salts of HMG-COA reductase inhibitors with organic amines<br>
which include (±)-l,2-dimethylpropylamine, 3-(2-aminoethylamino)-propylamine, n-butylamine,<br>
secondary butylamine, tertiary butylamine (TBA), dibutylamine, tertiary amylamine,<br>
cyclopentylamine, cyclohexylamine, cycloheptylamine, dicyclohexylamine (DCHA), N-<br>
methylcyclohexylamine, N,N'-diisopropylethylenediamine (DIPEDA), N,N'-diethylenediamine,<br>
N-methyl-l,3-propanediamine,	N-methylethylenediamine,         N,N,N',N'-tetramethyl-l,2-<br>
diaminoethane, N,N,N\N'-tetramethyl~l,4-diaminobutane, N,N,N',Nf-tetramethyl-l,6-diaminohexane, 1,2-dipiperidinethane, dipiperidinemethane, 2-amino-3, 3-dimethylbutane, N,N-dimethylcyclohexylamine, neopentylamine, adamantylamine, N,N-diethylcyclohexylamine, N-isopropylcyclohexylamine, N-methylcyclohexylamine, cyclobutylamine and norborylamine. However, this patent also mentions that amines having larger organic groups and especially those<br><br>
having bulky groups generally show a more easy crystallization and to lower extent form salts with unwanted side products when compared with amines having small organic groups.<br>
A number of organic and inorganic salts are described in literature that are mainly used for purifying rosuvastatin. There is a need in the art for additional salts of rosuvastatin that would allow purification of rosuvastatin. The present invention describes new amine salts that are hitherto unreported and having larger organic group.<br>
OBJECTIVE<br>
The main objective of the present invention is to provide novel crystalline diamine salts of rosuvastatin.<br>
Another objective of the present invention is to develop a simple, improved purification process for the preparation of pure rosuvastatin and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts through crystalline diamine salts.<br>
Yet another objective of the present invention is to isolate and recover rosuvastatin from mother liquors in pure form.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
In one aspect of the invention, amine salts of rosuvastatin of Formula I or solvates, hydrates, crystalline forms thereof are provided, wherein amine salts are represented by Formula HNR1R2CH2CH2NHR3R4 wherein R1, R2, R3, R4 independently represent hydrogen, straight or branched chain CMS alkyl, cycloalkyl, optionally substituted aryl, optionally substituted aryl, arylalkyl, heterocylclylalkyl, a heterocyclic residue containing one or more hetero atoms. The amine used is preferably N,N'~dibenzylethylenediamine salt.<br><br>
In second aspect of the present invention, a process for the preparation of N,N'-dibenzylethylenediamine salt of rosuvastatin of Formula I is carried out by dissolving rosuvastatin of Formula IV in water or in a mixture of water miscible organic solvent. The resulting solution is treated with an amine of Formula III or its salt. The precipitated product is isolated by filtration which is optionally washed with another solvent. The resulting product is dried and purified if required by recrystallization. The water or water miscible organic solvents employed are ethyl acetate, methanol, tetrahydrofuran or acetonitrile, more preferably in methanol or ethanol.<br>
The compound of Formula I is recrystallized with polar organic solvents like ethyl acetate, acetone, methanol, acetonitrile, tetrahydrofuran, ether or mixture thereof.<br>
Alternatively the rosuvastatin N,N'-dibenzylethylenediamine salt is purified by dissolving the salt in methanol and then precipitated by the addition of ethyl acetate.<br>
Finally the compound of Formula I is treated with aqueous acid in presence of organic solvent to produce rosuvastatin acid. The organic solvent used in the neutralization process is selected from ethyl acetate, butyl acetate, methylene chloride, toluene, methyl tert butyl ether (MTBE) and the like, more preferably ethyl acetate. The aqueous acids used are hydrochloric acid, sulphuric acid, phosphoric acid or organic acids like acetic acid, formic acid, more preferably hydrochloric acid. The organic layer is separated, washed with water or brine solution. The organic layer containing rosuvastatin acid is concentrated and further treated with calcium chloride in water. The reaction mixture is stirred for 2 hrs at 25-30°C wherein the product precipitates out. The precipitated product is filtered and washed with DM water which was subsequently dried under reduced pressure to obtain rosuvastatin calcium salt as a white amorphous powder.<br>
Alternatively the organic layer containing rosuvastatin acid is treated with aqueous sodium hydroxide solution to convert rosuvastatin acid to its sodium salt. This organic layer is again<br><br>
treated with another less polar organic solvent like toluene so that all the rosuvastatin sodium goes into the aqueous layer. Also the addition of toluene removes the hydrophobic impurities. This aqueous sodium salt solution of rosuvastatin is subsequently treated with calcium ions to give rosuvastatin calcium.<br>
The benzathine salt can also be treated with an inorganic base followed by extraction of base into a solvent such as toluene or ether etc. Thereafter the aqueous layer containing rosuvastatin salt (like sodium) is treated with calcium ions to yield rosuvastatin calcium.<br>
