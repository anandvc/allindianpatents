				<td>1. Field of Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a method of processing data in a<br>
computer system and a content addressable storage system.<br>
2. Description of the Related Art<br>
Content Addressed Storage (CAS) is a technique by which a unit of data stored<br>
on a storage system is accessed using an address that is derived from the content of the<br>
unit of data. As an example, the unit of data may be provided as an input to a hashing<br>
function which generates a hash value that is used as the content address for the unit of<br>
data. An example of a hashing function suitable for generating content addresses is the<br>
message digest 5 (MD5) hashing algorithm. When a host computer sends a request to a<br>
content-addressable storage system to retrieve a unit of data, the host provides the<br>
content address (e.g., hash value) of the unit of data. The storage system then<br>
determines, based on the content address, the physical location of the unit of data in the<br>
storage system, retrieves the unit of data from that location, and returns the unit of data to<br>
the host computer.<br>
The task of determining the physical location of the unit of data may involve<br>
several aspects, particularly when the storage system is a distributed storage system. A<br>
distributed storage system is one made up of a number of separate nodes, where each<br>
node may be a separate machine with separate resources (e.g., processor, memory, disk).<br>
The nodes communicate with each other (e.g., through a network) to handle data access<br>
requests from one or more host computers. To determine the physical location of a unit<br>
of data on the storage system based on the content address of the unit of data, the storage<br>
system first determines on which node the unit of data is stored. Then, the storage<br>
system determines which disk on that node the unit of data is stored (if the node has<br>
multiple disks), as well as the physical location on the disk at which the unit of data is<br>
stored (e.g., cylinder, head, sector).<br>
Figure 1 shows an example of a distributed storage system. The distributed<br>
storage system includes a plurality of access nodes (AN) 101a, 101b,...,101n, a plurality<br>
of storage nodes (SN) 105a, 105b, 105c,...,105n, and a network 103 that couples them<br>
together. Access nodes 101 may be used to process access requests (e.g., read/write<br>
requests) from host computers (not shown), while storage nodes 105 may be used to<br>
store data. When an access node receives a request from a host to read a unit of data, the<br>
access node determines on which storage node(s) the unit of data, is stored, and requests<br>
the unit of data from the appropriate storage node(s).<br>
One known method of determining which storage node stores a particular unit of<br>
data is referred to herein as a multicast location query (MLQ). In a multicast location<br>
query, an access node 101 receives a request to access a unit of data from a host. The<br>
access node then broadcasts a network message to each storage node 105, asking if the<br>
storage node stores the particular unit of data. Each storage node 105 then determines if<br>
the requested unit of data is stored thereon. Each storage node 105 may include a data<br>
( set (e.g., a database or table) that lists the content addresses of the units of data stored on<br>
that storage node, along with the disk in the storage node on which the unit of data is<br>
stored. That is, if the storage node has four disks, the table may indicate on which of the<br>
four disks each unit of data is stored. Thus, when a storage node 105 receives the MLQ<br>
network message from an access node 101, the storage node may scan its data set to<br>
determine if the requested unit of data is stored thereon.<br>
Once a storage node 105 determines that it stores the requested unit of data, the<br>
storage node, using the same data set, may determine on which physical disk the unit of<br>
data is stored. Then, the storage node may determine the physical location on the<br>
appropriate disk at which the unit of data is stored. The units of data may be stored as<br>
files in a file system on the storage node. Thus, to determine the physical disk location<br>
of a unit of data, the storage node may locate the corresponding file in the file system<br>
that includes the data unit and rely on the storage node's operating system to map the file<br>
system location, to a physical disk location. For example, when storing a unit of data, the<br>
storage node may create a file having the content address of the unit of data as its<br>
filename and store the unit of data in that file.<br>
Figure 2 is an illustrative file system for storing units of data in a distributed<br>
content-addressable storage system. The file system of Figure 2 includes a number of<br>
hierarchical directories. The directory at the top of the hierarchy is termed the root<br>
directory. At the second level in the hierarchy are a number of subdirectories. Each of<br>
these subdirectories represents the first character in the content address of a unit of data.<br>
That is, a unit of data having a content address beginning with the character 'A' will be<br>
stored in one of the subdirectories of directory 'A.' The subdirectory in which the unit of<br>
data will be stored is dependent on the second character of the content address. When<br>
the storage system later attempts to access the unit of data (e.g., in response to a read<br>
request), the storage system may locate the unit of data by traversing the file system<br>
hierarchy to locate the subdirectory whose name matches the first two characters of the<br>
content address of the unit of data. If the storage system locates the unit of data in its file<br>
system, it may open the file containing the unit of data to verify that the storage node<br>
does indeed have the unit of data stored thereon. Then, the storage node may return the<br>
. unit of data to the access node that issued the multicast request. The access node may<br>
\ then return the unit of data to the host that requested the unit of data.<br>
An MLQ is a computationally-expensive process, as it requires each storage node<br>
to perform an exhaustive database search for each unit of data requested. Further, most<br>
of these exhaustive searches will fail, as a unit of data typical resides on only one or a<br>
small number of storage nodes (assuming the unit of data is replicated on one or more<br>
storage nodes).<br>
To reduce the computational expense of using an MLQ to locate units of data on<br>
the storage system, another technique has been developed that employs an index to locate<br>
units of data. The index is referred to herein as a blob location index (BLI), with the<br>
term "blob" referring to a unit of data The BLI is a database that maps the content<br>
addresses of units of data ("blobs") to the storage node or nodes on which the content is<br>
stored. In much the same manner as in the MLQ scheme, units of data are stored in a<br>
location in the file system selected based on the content address of the unit of data.<br>
However, the administration of the BLI is split among the storage nodes, so that each<br>
storage node administers a portion of the BLI. Thus, access requests for a unit of data<br>
need not be broadcast to all storage nodes, but just to the one that administers the portion<br>
of the BLI that includesthe requested unit of data.<br>
A configuration of the BLI is shown in Figure 3. The responsibility of<br>
(administering the BLI is split evenly across storage nodes 301, 303, 305, and 307.<br>
Storage node 301 administers the portion of the BLI that contains content addresses<br>
beginning with characters 'A' - 'F', storage node 303 administers the portion of the BLI<br>
that contains content addresses beginning with characters 'G' - 'L', storage node 305<br>
administers the portion of the BLI that contains content addresses beginning with<br>
characters 'M' - 'R', and storage node 307 administers the portion of the BLI that<br>
contains content addresses beginning with characters 'S' - 'Z'. Each portion of the BLI<br>
includes an entry for every content address within the specified range that is stored on<br>
the storage system, and indicates on which storage node the corresponding unit of data is<br>
stored. The storage nodes also have local databases 309, 311, 313, and 315, which store<br>
the content addresses of units of data stored on their respective storage nodes and<br>
indicate on which physical disk of that storage node these content addresses are stored.<br>
The access nodes maintain a record of which portions of the BLI are administered<br>
by each storage node. Thus, when an access node receives a request from a host to<br>
retrieve a particular unit of data, the access node determines which storage node<br>
administers the portion of the BLI that contains the content address of the requested unit<br>
of data. For example, if a host sends a request to an access node for a unit of data having<br>
a content address beginning with 'S', the access node queries storage node 307 to<br>
determine which storage node stores the requested unit of data. Storage node 307<br>
searches the BLI to determine which storage node or nodes store the requested unit of<br>
data and returns this information to the requesting access node. The access node may<br>
request the unit of data directly from the appropriate storage node. In this manner, other<br>
storage nodes that do not store the unit of data are not queried. Thus, unlike an MLQ,<br>
using the BLI does not require each storage node to perform an exhaustive database<br>
search. Instead, only one storage node queries the BLI, and one storage node queries its<br>
local database, thereby reducing the overall computational expense on the storage<br>
system.<br>
In case of a failure in the BLI to return the storage node for a requested unit of<br>
data (i.e., if a content address requested by a host is not found in the BLI), the storage<br>
system may fall back on the MLQ scheme, and issue an MLQ to determine on which<br>
storage node the unit of data corresponding to the requested content address resides.<br>
By distributing the BLI administration responsibilities evenly among the storage<br>
nodes, the computational burden of locating a particular unit of data on the storage<br>
system is shared equally among the storage nodes. The randomness of the hashing<br>
function used to generate the content addresses is relied upon to distribute an<br>
approximately equal number of content addresses to each storage node. -When new<br>
storage nodes are added to the storage system or when storage nodes are removed from<br>
the storage system, the administration responsibilities of the BLI are redistributed among<br>
the storage nodes so that the administration responsibilities are evenly shared among all<br>
the storage nodes. Further, when new units of data are stored on the storage system, the<br>
storage node updates the BLI, updates the local database of the storage node on which<br>
the unit of data is stored, and writes the content itself to the storage system. This three-<br>
tiered write impacts the performance of the storage system in processing writes.<br>

index for the storage location is proximate to entries in the index for other units of data<br>

Another illustrative embodiment is directed to at least one computer readable medium<br>
encoded with instructions that, when executed on a computer system, perform the above-<br>

on the content of the unit of data, the method comprising an act of: (a) creating the<br>
content addresses for units of data to comprise first information that provides an<br>
indication of which units of data are written to the storage system proximate in time.<br>
The present invention also provides a method of processing data in a computer<br>
system comprising at least one host and at least one content addressable storage<br>

other units of data written to the at least one storage system proximate in time to the<br>
one of the units of data.<br>
The present invention further provides a content addressable storage system for<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
Aspects of the present invention relate to improved techniques for accessing<br>
content in a storage system.<br>
In accordance with one embodiment of the present invention, the storage system<br>
may provide hints to the host as to the location where a unit of data is stored within the<br>
storage system. On subsequent access requests to the unit of data, the host can provide<br>
the location hint back to the storage system, to facilitate the storage system locating the<br>
unit of data, and thereby increase the efficiency of the storage system in locating the unit<br>
data.<br>
In an alternate embodiment of the present invention, a content-addressable<br>
storage system is provided with an index that maps a content address of at least one unit<br>
of data to a storage location at which the unit of data is stored. The storage system<br>
maintains a cache of the location index to achieve performance improvements in<br>
accessing the information contained within the index.<br>
In a further embodiment of the present invention, a technique is employed for<br>
facilitating the processing of a request from a host to access a unit of data in a content-<br>
addressable storage system. The technique includes parsing the content address to<br>
determine at least one aspect of a physical storage location at which the unit of data is<br>
stored. By employing at least one aspect of the content address to be determinative of at<br>
least one aspect of the physical storage location wherein the unit of data can be stored,<br>
locating a unit of data in response to an access request can be achieved efficiently, as<br>
discussed below.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, a technique is employed to<br>
create content addresses for units of data, such that the content addresses include<br>
information that provides an indication of which units of data were written to the storage<br>
system proximate in time. As will be appreciated from the discussion below, providing<br>
content addresses that have some similarity in at least a portion thereof for units of data<br>
that are written proximate in time can increase efficiencies in a storage system locating<br>
units of data in response to access requests from a host.<br>
As should be appreciated from the foregoing, several of the aspects of the present<br>
invention are specifically directed to content-addressable storage systems. However, this<br>
is not true for other aspects of the present invention, which have broader applications.<br>
Thus, although the specific implementations described below relate particularly to a<br>
content-addressable storage system, it should be appreciated that all aspects of the<br>
present invention are not limited in this respect, as they can be employed on other types<br>
of storage systems.<br>
An illustrative computer system configuration on which aspects of the present<br>
invention can be employed is shown in Figure 4, which illustrates a host computer 401<br>
coupled to a storage system 407.<br>
Host computer 401 executes an application program 403 that reads and writes<br>
units of data, and an application programming interface (API) 405 that is adapted to<br>
interface with the storage system 407. Host 401 may be, for example, a server that<br>
provides resources (e.g., data storage, email, and other services), a client (e.g., a general-<br>
purpose computer system operated by a user), a network component (e.g., a switch) or<br>
any other type of computer. Host 401 is coupled by a communication link 404 to storage<br>
system 407 so that the host 401 can use the storage system 407 to store and retrieve data.<br>
The link 404 can be any type of communication link, including any type of network or<br>
direct connection.<br>
Application 403 may be any computer application program that a user or<br>
administrator of host 401 uses and that stores data to and/or retrieves data from storage<br>
system 407. Application program 403 is linked with API 405 so that application<br>
program 403 may use API 405 to communicate with storage system 407.<br>
API 405 may include, for example, computer object code that is provided to the<br>
programmer of application program 403. The computer object code includes routines<br>
that may be used to communicate with the storage system. When linked with API 405,<br>
an application program may call these routines to communicate with storage system 407.<br>
API 405 may be linked with any number of applications, and shields the programmer of<br>
application program 403 from the internal protocol by which storage system 407<br>
communicates. It should be appreciated that the aspects of the present invention<br>
described herein are not limited to use in a system that employs an API on the host<br>
specifically dedicated to facilitating communication between the host 401 and the storage<br>
system 407, as the nature of the host/storage system interface can be implemented in any<br>
of numerous ways, as the present invention is not limited to any particular<br>
implementation technique. As an example of one alternative implementation, application<br>
403 can be customized to communicate directly with the storage system 407.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, storage system 407 may be a content<br>
addressable storage (CAS) system of the type described in commonly assigned<br>
co-pending applications serials nos. 09/236,366, entitled "Content Addressable<br>
Information Encapsulation, Representation, and Transfer", filed January 21,1999;<br>
09/235,146 entitled "Access to Content Addressable Data Over A Network", filed<br>
January 21 1999; 09/391,360, entitled System and Method for Secure Storage, Transfer<br>
and Retrieval of Content Addressable Information, filed September 7,1999; and the<br>
application entitled "Method And Apparatus For Data Retention In A Storage System",<br>
filed on even date herewith, and not yet assigned a serial number, each of which is<br>
incorporated herein by reference. These applications relate to content addressable<br>
storage (CAS) and are referred to collectively as "the CAS applications".<br>
As discussed above, in a content-addressable system, data is stored using a<br>
content address generated based upon the content of the data itself. The content address<br>
may be generated by applying a hash function to the data to be stored. The output of the<br>
hash function may be used as at least part of the content address used in communication<br>
between the host and storage system to refer to the data. The content address can be<br>
mapped (e.g., within the storage system 407) to one or more physical storage locations<br>
within the storage system.<br>
One example of a hash function that may be used to generate the content address<br>
is message digest 5 (MD5). The content address can correspond directly to the result of<br>
the hash of the content, or additional information can be added to the hash result to<br>
generate the address. It should be understood that any type of hash function may be<br>
used, as the aspects of the invention described herein are not limited to the use of any<br>
particular type of hash function, and some aspects are not even limited to use in a content<br>
addressable system.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, a guaranteed unique identifier (GUID) may<br>
be added to one or more of the hash results to ensure that the content addresses for units<br>
of data are unique. The GUID may be generated, for example, based on the MAC<br>
address of the host computer that generates the content address, a timestamp, and a<br>
random number, or in any other suitable manner. One example for generating GUIDs<br>
that may be used in embodiments of the present invention is described in the<br>
International Standards Organization (ISO) specification ISO/IEC 11578:1996.<br>
When a host sends data to the storage system to be stored therein, both the host<br>
and the storage system may independently compute the content address of the data. The<br>
host may retain the content address for future use to retrieve the data from the storage<br>
system. Alternatively, only the storage system may compute the content address and<br>
return the computed content address to the host for later use in accessing the data. As yet<br>
another alternative, both the storage system and the host may compute the content<br>
address, and the storage system can return its generated content address to the host. The<br>
host can compare its independently computed content address to the one received from<br>
the storage system to verify that they match.<br>
In the illustrative configuration of Figure 4, storage system 407 is a distributed<br>
storage system including a plurality of access nodes 409a, 409b, 409c, and 409d and a<br>
plurality of storage nodes 411a, 411b, 411c, and 411d. The access nodes 409 and storage<br>
nodes 411 may be coupled in any suitable way, such as by a communications network<br>
(not shown) that employs the TCP/IP network protocol. Each access node 409 and<br>
storage node 411 may be, for example, a separate computer having independent<br>
hardware and software resources (i.e., processor or processors, memory, disk resources,<br>
operating system, storage system software), although the aspects of the present invention<br>
are not limited in this respect.<br>
As mentioned above, host computer 401 issues access requests (e.g., reads, writes<br>
or other requests) to one of access nodes 409. In the case of write requests, access nodes<br>
409 may receive the write request (and the data to be written) from the host computer,<br>
select a storage node 411 to store the data, and send the data to that storage node for<br>
storage. In some embodiments, access nodes 409may select a storage node 411 in any<br>
suitable manner. For example, access nodes 409 may employ a load balancing scheme to<br>
distribute data evenly across the storage nodes, or access nodes 409 may employ a<br>
different selection technique. As mentioned above in connection with Figure 2, when<br>
storing a unit of data, a storage node may create a file having the content address of the<br>
unit of data as its filename and may store the unit of data in that file.<br>
In the case of read requests, access nodes 409 may receive the request from the<br>
host computer, determine on which storage node 411 the requested data is stored,<br>
retrieve the requested data from the appropriate storage node 411, and return the<br>
requested data to the host computer. The aspects of the present invention described<br>
herein are not limited to this or any other particular configuration, as any suitable<br>
configuration of the storage system can be employed. For example, rather than having<br>
the access nodes retrieve the requested data from storage nodes and forward the data to<br>
the host 401, the storage system could alternatively be configured so that the access node<br>
simply instructs the storage node to return the data directly to the host 401.<br>
Storage nodes 411 may receive read and write requests from access nodes 409<br>
and, in response, retrieve and store data. As such, storage nodes 411 may include one or<br>
more storage devices (e.g., disk drives or any other type of storage device) on which<br>
units of data are stored. It should be appreciated that access nodes 409 may also include<br>
one or more storage devices, such that access nodes 409 and storage nodes 411 may have<br>
the same (or approximately the same) or different hardware configurations.<br>
Figure 4 illustrates a storage system having four access nodes and four storage<br>
nodes. However, it should be appreciated that this configuration is merely illustrative, as<br>
the storage system may include any suitable number of access nodes and any suitable<br>
number (which may differ from the number of access nodes) of storage nodes, as the<br>
invention is not limited to use on a storage system configured in any particular manner<br>
in this respect.<br>
Further, it should be appreciated that while the example of Figure 4 includes<br>
access nodes with which host computers communicate to access the storage system and<br>
storage nodes that store the units of data, the invention is not limited in this respect. For<br>
example, the storage system may include nodes which both communicate with host<br>
computers and store units of data. That is, one or more nodes may serve (at least in part)<br>
as both a storage node and access node.<br>
Location Hints<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, the storage system may provide location<br>
hints to the host to increase the efficiency of accesses to the storage system. A location<br>
hint is information provided from the storage system to the host and relating to where a<br>
particular unit of data is stored on the storage system. The information provided in the<br>
location hint can then be passed back from the host to the storage system in connection<br>
with future access requests for the unit of data, and the information can be used by the<br>
storage system to efficiently access the unit of data. The location hint for a particular<br>
unit of data may include information regarding the storage node on which the unit of data<br>
is stored, the physical storage device on that storage node that stores the unit of data, the<br>
file system location of the file containing that unit of data on that physical storage device,<br>
the location on the physical device of which the unit of data is stored, or any combination<br>
thereof. In addition, as opposed to information that directly identifies one or more<br>
aspects of the physical storage location for the unit of data, the information provided in a<br>
location hint can be related to where the unit of data is physically stored in other ways.<br>
For example, the storage system could include a index of the physical storage location<br>
for units of data and the location hint provided to the host could provide a key into this<br>
index. Thus, the information provided in the location hint can be related to where the<br>
unit of data is physically stored in any suitable way.<br>
The storage system may provide the location hint to the host in any one of a<br>
variety of ways, as the invention is not limited in this respect. For example, in response<br>
to a write request from the host computer to write a unit of data, the storage system may<br>
return the location hint information (e.g., as a token or in any form) for the unit of data.<br>
The location hint may be the only information returned, or it may be sent back to the host<br>
with other information returned to the host in response to a write request. For example,<br>
in one embodiment, the storage system responds to a write request by returning the<br>
content address (e.g., the MD5 hash value) corresponding to the unit of data so that the<br>
host may verify that the storage system has computed the content address correctly. In<br>
one embodiment, when returning the content address to the host in response to the write<br>
request, the storage system may also send the location hint, as shown conceptually at 406<br>
in Figure 4.<br>
The storage system may also provide location hint information to the host in<br>
response to a read request. For example, when the storage system returns the requested<br>
unit of data to the host, the storage system may also send the location hint information<br>
for the requested unit of data.<br>
The storage system may also provide location hint information to the host in<br>
response to query requests, or any other type of request. A query request is a request to<br>
the storage system in which a host may request units of data based on information about<br>
the units of data. Such information may be, for example, the time at which the units of<br>
data were stored on the storage system, part of the metadata stored in a CDF, a partial<br>
content address, or any other suitable information.<br>
For example, instead of providing a content address to the storage system (as in a<br>
typical read request), the host may provide a time range (e.g., a start time and an end<br>
time) to the storage system. In response, the storage system returns to the host a list of<br>
the content addresses corresponding to units of data that were stored on the storage<br>
system during the period of time indicated by the time range. The storage system may<br>
send location hint information to the host for each of the units identified in response to<br>
the query request. Providing location hints in response to a query request may be useful<br>
because it is likely that the host will issue read requests for at least some of the content<br>
addresses returned by the storage system in response to the query request. If the host can<br>
inform the storage system of the location of the units of data corresponding to these<br>
content addresses (i.e., from the location hint), computational resources (and time) on the<br>
storage system expended in locating the units of data on the storage system can be<br>
reduced.<br>
As mentioned above, the information that may be provided to the storage system<br>
in a query request is not limited to a time range. The information may additionally or<br>
alternatively include part of the metadata stored in a CDF, a partial content address, or<br>
any other suitable information. For example, if the query request includes metadata<br>
stored in a CDF or a partial content address, the storage system may return the content<br>
addresses of any CDFs that include the specified metadata or partial content address.<br>
The host may use the location hint information received from the storage system<br>
in any of a variety of ways, as the invention is not limited in this respect. As mentioned<br>
above, an application program 403 (Figure 4) executing on the host may communicate<br>
with the storage system through an API 405. When the API receives a location hint from<br>
the storage system (e.g., in response to a read, write, query request, or other access<br>
request), the API may provide the location hint to the application program. The<br>
application program may then store the location hint information in a manner that<br>
associates it with the corresponding content address. Thus, the next time the application<br>
program requests access to the unit of data corresponding to that content address (i.e.,<br>
through the API), the application program may provide the location hint information<br>
along with the content address.<br>
Alternatively, instead of passing the location hint information to the application<br>
program, the API may store the location hint information itself. Thus, the API may<br>
receive from the application program a request to access a unit of data on the storage<br>
system, with the request including the content address for the desired unit of data. The<br>
API may determine if it has stored a location hint corresponding to that content address.<br>
If so, the API may provide the location hint to the storage system along with the access<br>
request.<br>
The host (e.g., the API or the application program) may store the location hint<br>
information in any suitable manner. In one embodiment, the host (e.g., the API)<br>
maintains a cache of stored location hints and their corresponding content addresses for<br>
performance reasons. When the cache is full, the API or application program may<br>
replace items in the cache using a least-recently used replacement scheme, most-recently<br>
used replacement scheme, or any other suitable cache replacement scheme.<br>
It should be appreciated that the use of location hints shifts some of the<br>
computational burden of locating data on the storage system from the storage system to<br>
the host, as the host computer maintains and accesses records of location information.<br>
When issuing an access request to the storage system, the host computer may search<br>
these records and provide location information, if available, to the storage system. This<br>
enables the storage system to avoid at least some of the searching of records on the<br>
storage system to determine the physical location for a stored data unit.<br>
In another embodiment, the host may simply ignore any location hints that it<br>
receives from the storage system. That is, the host may choose not to bear any of the<br>
computational burden of locating data and may rely on the storage system to locate the<br>
content.<br>
In another embodiment, the use of location hints is provided as an optional<br>
feature to the host, such that the feature can be turned on or off.<br>
It should be appreciated that the location hint information can be determined by<br>
the storage system in any of numerous ways, as the present invention is not limited to<br>
any particular implementation technique. In accordance with one embodiment of the<br>
present invention for use with a storage system having the configuration shown in Figure<br>
4, the location information can be generated by the access nodes 409 and possibly also<br>
by the storage nodes 411 depending upon the granularity of the location information<br>
provided. In this respect, and as discussed above, the location information can be<br>
provided in any of numerous levels of granularity, as the present invention is not limited<br>
in this respect. For example, the location information can provide a hint only as to which<br>
access node controls access to the physical storage location, or can provide additional<br>
information relating to a specific storage node that stores the unit of data. Similarly, the<br>
information relating to the particular storage node that stores the unit of data can also be<br>
provided at numerous levels of granularity, as this information can merely identify the<br>
storage node, or can alternatively be more descriptive and can identify a file system<br>
location and optionally also a particular storage device (e.g., disk drive) on which the<br>
unit of data is stored. It should be appreciated that in response to an access request, it is<br>
a fairly simple process for the storage system to generate the location information,<br>
because, as of a result of accessing the unit of data, the storage system will go through<br>
the process of determining the physical storage location and will have this information<br>
available to provide in a hint to the host. For example, in one embodiment of the present<br>
invention, when a unit of data is accessed, the storage node on which the data is stored<br>
identifies to the appropriate access node the file system and disk drive on which the data<br>
is stored, and the access node then passes this information along to the host in the form<br>
of the location hint described above. It should be appreciated that the levels of<br>
granularity and the manner in which the location information is generated is not limited<br>
to the examples described herein, nor to a storage system having the type of<br>
configuration shown in Figure 4, as this aspect of the present invention can be used in<br>
connection with numerous other types of storage system configurations, including those<br>
that do not employ an access node and storage node structure.<br>
If location hints are not used (i.e., the feature is turned off), or if the host does not<br>
have location information for a particular unit of data, the storage system may use a<br>
multi-cast location query, BLI lookup, or any other suitable technique to locate the data.<br>
Further, in some circumstances, a location hint may not correctly identify the location of<br>
the content on the storage system. Such a situation may occur, for example, when the<br>
storage system moves the content to a new location after the host has received the<br>
location hint. If a location hint fails to identify the correct location of the content on the<br>
storage system, the storage system may use another method of locating the content, such<br>
as MLQ, BLI lookup, or any other suitable technique.<br>
BLI Caching<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, the storage system maintains a data set (e.g.,<br>
a database) referred to as a blob location index (BLI) that works in the manner of the BLI<br>
described above in connection with a known system. In one embodiment, the<br>
responsibility of administering the BLI is distributed among storage nodes 411 (Figure<br>
4), with each having a designated range of addresses (e.g., content addresses) that it is<br>
responsible for and an index for the addresses in that range to identify where the<br>
corresponding data units are stored. The BLI itself (in addition to the administration<br>
responsibilities) may also be distributed across multiple nodes of the storage system. To<br>
increase the efficiency of accesses to the BLI, portions of the BLI are cached in<br>
accordance with one embodiment of the invention.<br>
The blob location index may be a database (or other data set) that maps, for units<br>
of data stored on the storage system, the content address corresponding to the unit of data<br>
to the storage node on which the unit of data is stored. The BLI may be stored in its<br>
entirety on one storage node (and optionally mirrored on one or more other storage<br>
nodes) or may be distributed among two or more storage nodes as discussed above. In<br>
response to an access request to a particular address, the access node 409 that receives<br>
the request directs it to a storage node 411 that administers the portion of the BLI that<br>
includes that address, and the BLI is read by the appropriate storage node to determine<br>
the location of the requested unit of data on the storage system.<br>
It should be understood that the administration of a single portion of the BLI may<br>
be shared by more than one storage node, in which case the access node 409 may direct<br>
such requests to one or all of the storage nodes that administer that portion of the BLI.<br>
It should also be understood that in some embodiments of the invention, storage<br>
of the BLI or administration of the BLI may be performed by both access nodes and<br>
storage nodes, or solely by access nodes, as the invention is not limited in this respect. It<br>
should further be appreciated that the techniques discussed below for caching portions of<br>
the BLI are equally applicable to both access nodes and storage nodes.<br>
In the prior art system, the BLI is stored in secondary memory (e.g., magnetic<br>
disk), which is slower to access than primary memory. When the access request is a ¦<br>
write request for a new unit of data with no entry on the BLI, the BLI is updated to<br>
include the content address and storage node location of the newly stored data. The<br>
storage system waits for the BLI to be updated before indicating to the host that the write<br>
has been successfully completed. If the portion of the BLI to be updated is not already in<br>
the primary memory of the storage node, the storage node updating the BLI performs a<br>
disk read to read the BLI into primary memory (i.e., RAM), updates the BLI in primary<br>
memory, and then performs a disk write to write the updated BLI back to disk. Thus,<br>
from the point of view of an application program, there is some latency from the time a<br>
write request is issued to the time that the storage system confirms a successful write and<br>
returns the content address of the written data, and this latency is increased when the<br>
confirmation is not returned until the BLI is updated.<br>
In accordance with one embodiment of the invention, the storage system<br>
maintains a BLI cache in primary memory (e.g., RAM) to provide for improved access<br>
performance. For example, in response to a write request, the storage system can write<br>
the new entry into the BLI cache in primary memory and respond to the requesting host<br>
that the write has completed successfully. The contents of the BLI cache can be destaged<br>
to the BLI on disk at a later time. As a result, the latency caused by updating the BLI is<br>
reduced.<br>
The BLI cache also increases the efficiency of the read accesses to the storage<br>
system. When a read request is received, the storage system may search the BLI cache to<br>
determine if location of the requested unit of data is stored in the BLI cache. If it is, the<br>
need for a disk read to the BLI is obviated.<br>
The BLI cache can be arranged and stored in any suitable manner as the present<br>
invention is not limited to any particular implementation technique. For example, when<br>
the BLI is stored entirely on a single storage node, the BLI cache may be maintained<br>
entirely on the same storage node or distributed among multiple storage nodes.<br>
Similarly, when the BLI is distributed across multiple storage nodes, one storage node<br>
may be used to store the BLI cache or each storage node could store the portion of the<br>
BLI cache (412a-d in Figure 4) corresponding to the portion of the BLI stored by that<br>
storage node.<br>
It should be understood that the above described locations of the BLI cache are<br>
given only as examples, as the BLI cache may be located anywhere in the storage system<br>
and/or distributed across the storage system in any manner, with entries of a distributed<br>
BLI cache not necessarily being limited to being on the same machine as corresponding<br>
entries for the BLI. It should further be appreciated that the BLI cache may be destaged<br>
to the BLI in any suitable manner, as the invention is not limited in this respect. For<br>
example, entries in the BLI cache may be destaged to the BLI whenever the BLI cache is<br>
full according to any suitable replacement algorithm. Alternatively, BLI cache entries<br>
may be destaged to the BLI during periods of light processor usage within the storage<br>
system. As yet another alternative, BLI cache entries may be destaged to the BLI after a<br>
fixed period of time has elapsed.<br>
In one embodiment, access nodes may also cache BLI entries, either instead of or<br>
in addition to storing BLI cache entries on the storage nodes. When an access node<br>
processes a write request from a host, the access node selects on which storage node the<br>
data is written, so the access node has this information along with the content address of<br>
the newly written data and can add it in its BLI cache. In one embodiment, after the<br>
storage node stores the newly written data, it can return information to the access node<br>
regarding the file system and disk on the storage node where the data is stored so that<br>
this information also can be added to the cache entry on the access node. It should be<br>
appreciated that the present invention is not limited in this respect, as the BLI cache<br>
entries can, alternatively, identify only the storage node on which the data units are<br>
stored.<br>
When the access node receives a read request, it may search for the requested<br>
content address in its BLI cache. If there is a cache hit (i.e., the content address is found<br>
in the cache), then the access node need not query the BLI on the storage system, as the<br>
access node determines the storage location for the requested unit of data from its own<br>
BLI cache. Thus, the response time in returning the requested unit of data may be further<br>
reduced.<br>
It should be appreciated that the BLI cache on the access nodes can be used with<br>
or without another layer of BLI caching on the storage nodes. It should also be<br>
understood that the BLI, as described above, maps content addresses to storage nodes<br>
which store the units of data corresponding to those content addresses. However, the<br>
BLI.may also include information about the particular physical disk device and/or file<br>
system location of the unit of data, as the invention is not limited in this respect.<br>
In one embodiment, BLI caching is provided as an optional feature to the user of<br>
the storage system, such that the feature can be turned on or off.<br>
As discussed above, when a new unit of data is written to the storage system, in<br>
addition to writing the data to a storage node and updating the metadata in the storage<br>
system that relates to where the unit of data is stored, in the embodiment that employs a<br>
BLI cache, the BLI cache may be updated as well. As further mentioned above, the<br>
updating of numerous areas in the storage system may provide some latency in terms of<br>
when a confirmation is sent from the storage system to the host that a write request has<br>
been processed. In accordance with one embodiment of the present invention, the write<br>
to the BLI cache can be done after the confirmation is provided to the host, as the failure<br>
to have an entry in the BLI cache for a unit of data will only impact the performance of a<br>
future access to the unit of data, but will not preclude the unit of data from being<br>
accessed by the storage system. In a further embodiment of the present invention, the<br>
confirmation can also be provided even before any appropriate entries are written to the<br>
BLI, to further improve write performance. In this respect, it should be appreciated that<br>
in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention, if an access request is<br>
received to read data and no corresponding entry is provided in the BLI, the storage<br>
system may issue a multicast location query for the unit of data to see whether it is stored<br>
on any of the storage nodes. Thus, in accordance with this embodiment of the present<br>
invention, the storage system is able to locate units of data even if they do not include a<br>
corresponding entry in the BLI.<br>
It should be appreciated that the above discussion relating to implementing a<br>
cache of a location index in a content-addressable storage system having the<br>
configuration shown in Figure 4 is provided merely for illustrative purposes, and that the<br>
present invention is not limited in this respect. The aspect of the present invention<br>
relating to the use of a cache for a location index in a content-addressable storage system<br>
can be employed with storage systems having configurations other than the access<br>
node/storage node configuration shown in Figure 4.<br>
Furthermore, it should be appreciated that the aspects of the present invention<br>
relating to caching a location index and the use of a location hint that can be passed to<br>
the host computer are not mutually exclusive, and that these two features can be used<br>
together as well as separately.<br>
Intrinsic Locations<br>
An alternate embodiment uses a technique (referred to herein as intrinsic<br>
locations) that employs at least a portion of the content address to determine at least one<br>
aspect of the storage location for units of data on the storage system. Figure 5 shows an<br>
illustrative storage system 507 using intrinsic locations. Storage system 507 includes a<br>
plurality of access nodes 503a, 503b, and 503c and a plurality of storage nodes 505a,<br>
505b, 505c, 505d, 505e, and 505f. The storage nodes may be divided into groups such<br>
that each group of storage nodes is assigned a range of content address. In the example<br>
of Figure 5, storage nodes 505a and 505b are assigned content addresses beginning with<br>
characters 'A' - 'I', storage nodes 505c and 505d are assigned content addresses<br>
beginning with characters 'J'-'R', and storage nodes 505e and 505f are assigned content<br>
addresses beginning with characters 'S'-'Z'. In Figure 5, each group of storage nodes<br>
includes two storages nodes. However, it should be understood that a storage node group<br>
may include only one storage node or may include three or more storage nodes. Further,<br>
it is not necessary that each group of storage nodes include an equal number of storage<br>
nodes.<br>
In one embodiment, each group of storage nodes stores the data units<br>
corresponding to its assigned range of content addresses. Access nodes 503 maintain<br>
information of which range of content addresses are assigned to each group of storage<br>
nodes and, as such, may select the appropriate storage node to access units of data in<br>
response to an access request.<br>
For example, if access node 503a receives from host 501a a request to write a unit<br>
of data whose content address begins with the character 'J', access node will select either<br>
storage node 505c or 505d to store the data. In one embodiment, access node 503a<br>
selects one of these two storage nodes based on another part of the content address. For<br>
example, access node 503a may examine the second character of the content address to<br>
select the appropriate storage node within the selected group. For example, storage node<br>
505c may store data units whose content addresses have a second character of 'A'-'M'<br>
and storage node 505d may store data units whose content addresses have a second<br>
character of 'N'-'Z'. It should be appreciated that any character(s) in the content address<br>
may be used to select the appropriate storage node within a group of multiple storage<br>
nodes, as the invention is not limited in this respect.<br>
Once access node 503a has selected a storage node to store the unit of data, the<br>
selected storage node may select a physical storage device (e.g., disk) on which to store<br>
the unit of data. Figure 6 conceptually shows a storage node 601 having four physical<br>
storage devices, 603a, 603b, 603c, and 603d. The storage node 601 may select one of<br>
these storage devices to store a unit of data based on one or more characters in the<br>
content address. For example, storage node 601 may select one of the storage devices<br>
603 based on the third character of the content address. If the third character of the<br>
content address is 'A'-'F', storage device 603a may store the data. If the third character<br>
is 'G'-'L', storage device 603b may store the data. If the third character is 'M'-'R',<br>
storage device 603c stores the data. If the third character is 'S'-'Z' storage device 603d<br>
stores the data.<br>
By selecting the physical storage location (e.g., storage node and storage device)<br>
of a unit of data based on the content address of the unit of data, an access node may later<br>
determine the physical location without a database lookup or multicast location query.<br>
That is, the access node may simply examine the content address and determine the<br>
location of the unit of data based on the content address.<br>
While the illustrative example described above uses the intrinsic location<br>
technique to determine not only the storage node on which a unit of data is stored based<br>
upon its content address, but also the file system and storage device within that node, it<br>
should be appreciated that the aspect of the present invention relating to the use of<br>
intrinsic locations is not limited in this respect, as it can be employed to determine only<br>
some aspects of the physical storage location of a unit of data but not others. For<br>
example, the intrinsic locations technique could alternatively be used to select only a<br>
storage node on which a unit of data is stored, and to thereby eliminate the need to<br>
perform lookups or broadcast queries to determine the storage node, but the<br>
determination of the file system and/or physical storage device on which the unit of data<br>
is stored can be performed in other ways, including through the use of indexing<br>
techniques as described above.<br>
Applicants have appreciated that for some units of data, it may be desirable to not<br>
store them in the particular physical storage location specified for the unit of data by the<br>
intrinsic locations technique based upon its content address, and Applicants have<br>
developed a technique to address such units of data. This can occur for any of numerous<br>
reasons, an example of which is a particularly large unit of data. For a large unit of data,<br>
there may not be room on the physical storage location specified by the mapping<br>
performed by the intrinsic locations technique to store the data, or it may be preferable to<br>
store it elsewhere for load balancing purposes. In addition, some application programs<br>
that write a particularly large unit of data to a storage system may wish to begin the write<br>
operation before generating a content address based upon the entire unit of data, such<br>
that the write operation may begin for a unit a data before the content address has been<br>
determined. Thus, when the intrinsic locations technique is employed, there may not be<br>
a content address to determine where to store the unit of data when the unit of data is<br>
passed to the storage system. In accordance with one embodiment of the present<br>
invention, the above-described situations can be addressed by using the intrinsic<br>
locations technique and pointers. For example, if it is desired to store a unit of data (e.g.,<br>
a relatively large one) in a location other than that specified by the intrinsic location<br>
mapping technique described above, a pointer can be stored in the storage location<br>
specified by the content address for the unit of data, with the pointer pointing to another<br>
physical storage location at which it is more desirable to store the unit of data. Thus,<br>
when future access requests are received for the unit of data, the intrinsic location<br>
mapping techniques will map to the pointer for the unit of data, which can then be read<br>
and used to retrieve the data.<br>
The pointer technique can also be employed when handling a write request for a<br>
unit of data for which no content address has yet been generated. In this respect, when<br>
the unit of data is received, the storage location can place it in any suitable storage<br>
location, and then once the content address for the unit of data is determined and/or<br>
provided, a pointer can be placed in the appropriate location determined by the intrinsic<br>
location mapping technique for the newly provided content address, with the pointer<br>
pointing to the storage location that was chosen for the unit of data. Of course, it should<br>
be appreciated that the data could alternatively be moved to the storage location specified<br>
by the intrinsic location mapping technique once the content address is provided.<br>
Further, in one embodiment, in which the pointer technique is used to store data,<br>
the storage system may execute a background process that periodically searches the<br>
storage system for pointers pointing to other storage locations at which units of data are<br>
stored. If any such pointer is found, the process may move the unit of data from the<br>
storage location pointed to by the pointer to the storage location specified by the intrinsic<br>
location mapping (i.e., the location of the pointer), thereby replacing the pointer with the<br>
corresponding unit of data. Thus, the storage system's efficiency in accessing the units<br>
of data (e.g., in response to a read request from a host computer) may be increased, as the<br>
storage system need not access both the storage location of the pointer and the storage<br>
location of the unit of data.<br>
It should be understood that the background process for replacing pointers with<br>
their corresponding units of data may be executed on any the storage system in any<br>
suitable way. For example, the process may be executed only on storage nodes that are<br>
idle. Alternatively, the process may be executed on every storage node after a<br>
predetermined period of time has elapsed. Many other alternatives are available and the<br>
invention is not limited in this respect.<br>
In accordance with one embodiment of the present invention, if a unit of data<br>
cannot be found using the intrinsic location technique, alternative look up techniques can<br>
be employed, such as performing a multicast location query.<br>
Temporal Locality of Reference<br>
As mentioned above, in one embodiment, units of data are stored in files on a file<br>
system of the corresponding storage node. Such files may have a filename<br>
corresponding, at least in part, to the content address of the unit of data stored therein,<br>
and the file system may be organized in directories and subdirectories with the name of<br>
the subdirectory in which a particular unit of data is stored corresponding at least in part<br>
to at least a portion of the filename of the unit of data. As mentioned above, the file<br>
system may be organized based on the first characters of the content addresses of the<br>
units of data stored in the file system. However, it should be appreciated that the<br>
invention is not limited in this respect, as the file system may be organized using any<br>
portion of the content address including, but not limited to, the first letters or bits, the<br>
middle portion, or the end portion. The hashing algorithm used to generate content<br>
addresses may yield fairly random values (as is the case with the MD5 hashing<br>
algorithm). As a result Applicants have appreciated that units of data written at<br>
approximately the same time may be stored in different locations in the file system<br>
hierarchy. That is, despite the fact that the units of data are written in close proximity in<br>
time, these units of data may be scattered across the file system. Thus, the randomness<br>
of the hashing algorithm precludes any locality of reference in the file system.<br>
Operating systems typically maintain a file system map that maps file system<br>
locations to physical disk locations. When the file system is large (i.e., a large hierarchy<br>
of directories and subdirectories) and there are many files stored in the file system, the<br>
file system map maintained by the operating system may also be quite large. As a result,<br>
the operating system may only keep a small portion of the file system map in the primary<br>
memory (e.g., RAM) of the storage node at one time. The rest of the file system map<br>
may remain in secondary memory (e.g., disk). As various portions of the file system<br>
map are needed (i.e., when files are accessed), they may be brought into primary<br>
memory, with other portions being swapped out to disk. It should be appreciated that<br>
access performance is better when accessing portions of the file system in memory rather<br>
than disk.<br>
If two units of data are written to the storage node proximate in time but stored in<br>
different portions of the file system map, the operating system first must load from disk<br>
the portion of the file system map having the file system location of the first unit of data<br>
(i.e., to determine the physical disk location of that unit of data) and then must return to<br>
disk to load the portion of the file system map having the file system location of the<br>
second unit of data. These repeated disk accesses slow the write response time of the<br>
storage system. In addition, since units of data written proximate in time are also often<br>
read proximate in time, a similar access delay may be encountered when reading the data<br>
units.<br>
Applicants have appreciated that in a storage system that employs a file system<br>
structure, it is desirable to store units of data that are stored at approximately the same<br>
time in the approximately the same file system location, to minimize the likelihood of the<br>
operating system having to go to disk to load different portions of the file system for<br>
sequentially accessed data units. As mentioned above, in one embodiment of the<br>
invention, the file system location of a file is determined based on the filename of the<br>
file. Thus, in accordance with one embodiment of the invention, information is added to<br>
the filename of the file that is similar for files written at approximately the same time.<br>
This provides temporal locality of reference for files written at approximately the same<br>
time, and tends to result in those filed being stored in proximate file system locations.<br>
It should be appreciated that in embodiments of the invention that employ content<br>
addressable storage, the information that is added to the filename of the file may also be<br>
added to the content address of the data stored in the file. For example, the information<br>
may be added to the hash of the content of the file to generate a content address based on<br>
the hash and the additional information. The information may be added at any suitable<br>
position in the hash. For example, the information may be added to the beginning, the<br>
end, or at any other position in the hash. The host computer may use the content address<br>
to access the file in the manner described above.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, the information added to establish temporal<br>
locality of reference may be added to the content address at the storage system. That is,<br>
for example, when a unit of data is stored to the storage system, the storage system may<br>
generate the temporal locality of reference information, include the information in the<br>
hash, and return the resulting content address to the host computer that submitted the<br>
storage request.<br>
In an alternate embodiment, the host computer generates the temporal locality of<br>
reference information and adds the information to the hash to generate the content<br>
address. The host computer may send the content address to the storage system or may<br>
just send the temporal locality of reference information to the storage system and allow<br>
the storage system to add the information to the hash to determine the content address.<br>
By computing the temporal locality of reference information at the host computer, if the<br>
host computer stores the unit of data on multiple storage systems at the same time (or<br>
approximately the same time), e.g., for backup or replication purposes, the content<br>
address for the unit of data is the same on each of the storage systems.<br>
In another embodiment, temporal locality of reference information may be<br>
generated by the storage system and the host computer, and both sets of information may<br>
be added to the hash, at any suitable position in the hash, to generate the content address<br>
of the unit of data.<br>
The above example was described as providing temporal locality of reference<br>
with respect to files stored in a file system. However it should be appreciated that such a<br>
technique is applicable to other logical data storage constructs. For example, adding<br>
temporal locality of reference information to content addresses (or other information<br>
stored in a database) may increase access efficiency of database tables that are accessed<br>
using a content address (or other information) as a key, and can also be used with other<br>
logical constructs.<br>
The information added to the filename may be any information that is similar for<br>
data units written at approximately the same time. For example, a timestamp may be<br>
added to the file names, and the timestamp can be examined by the file system in<br>
determining where to store the data units. Alternatively, a counter value may be added to<br>
the file names with the counter value being incremented each time a new data unit is<br>
written to the storage system. Again, any suitable information may be used, as the<br>
invention is not limited in this respect.<br>
It should be appreciated that the aspect of the present invention that relates to<br>
adding information to a content address that provides an indication of which units of data<br>
are written to the storage system proximate in time is not limited to a storage system<br>
having the particular access node and storage node configuration described, or to<br>
employing a file system on the storage node as described above, as this aspect of the<br>
present invention can be used in connection with storage systems having numerous<br>
different configurations.<br>
Figure 7 conceptually illustrates the temporal locality of reference aspect of the<br>
present invention, as it illustrates locality information 703 being added to a content<br>
address 701. It should be appreciated that this aspect of the present invention is not<br>
limited to providing locality information at the beginning of the content address as<br>
shown in Figure 7, as the locality information can be added to the content address in any<br>
suitable manner, including providing it at the end of the content address, or within the<br>
range of the content address, and including providing locality information as a<br>
contiguous block as shown in Figure 7, or dispersed throughout the content address<br>
information 701.<br>
The above-described embodiments of the present invention can be implemented<br>
in any of numerous ways. For example, the embodiments may be implemented using<br>
hardware, software or a combination thereof. When implemented in software, the<br>
software code can be executed on any suitable processor or collection of processors,<br>
whether provided in a single computer or distributed among multiple computers. It<br>
should be appreciated that any component or collection of components that perform the<br>
functions described above can be generically considered as one or more controllers that<br>
control the above-discussed functions. The one or more controllers can be implemented<br>
in numerous ways, such as with dedicated hardware, or with general purpose hardware<br>

In this respect, it should be appreciated that one implementation of the<br>
embodiments of the present invention comprises at least one computer-readable medium<br>
(e.g., a computer memory, a floppy disk, a compact disk, a tape, etc.) encoded with a<br>
computer program (i.e., a plurality of instructions), which, when executed on a processor,<br>
performs the above-discussed functions of the embodiments of the present invention.<br>
The computer-readable medium can be transportable such that the program stored<br>
thereon can be loaded onto any computer system resource to implement the aspects of<br>
the present invention discussed herein. In addition, it should be appreciated that the<br>

processor to implement the above-discussed aspects of the present invention.<br>
It should be appreciated that in accordance with several embodiments of the<br>
present invention wherein processes are implemented in a computer readable medium,<br>
the computer implemented processes may, during the course of their execution, receive<br>

this respect.<br>

at least one host accesses data units stored on the content addressable storage<br>
system using content addresses generated based on the content of the data units, the<br>
content addressable data storage system comprising:<br>
at least one storage device to store data received from the at least one host;<br>
and<br>
at least one controller that maintains an index that maps content addresses for<br>
units of data to storage locations within the at least one storage system where the units<br>
of data are stored so that units of data written to the at least one storage system<br>
proximate in time have proximate entries in the index.<br>
11. A method of processing data in a computer system, substantially as herein<br>
described, particularly with reference to the accompanying drawings.<br>
12. A content addressable storage system for use in a computer system,<br>
substantially as herein described, particularly with reference to the accompanying<br>
drawings.<br>
One embodiment is a system for locating content on a storage system, in<br>
which the storage system provides a location hint to the host of where the<br>
data is physically stored, which the host can resubmit with future access<br>
requests. In another embodiment, an index that maps content addresses to<br>
physical storage locations is cached on the storage system. In yet another<br>
embodiment, intrinsic locations are used to select a storage location for newly<br>
written data based on an address of the data. In a further embodiment, units<br>
of data that are stored at approximately the same time having location index<br>
entries that are proximate in the index.</td>
