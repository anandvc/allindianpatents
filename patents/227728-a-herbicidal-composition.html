The amounts of the urea herbicide and (b) applied vary with the nature of the weeds, the compositions used, the time of application, the climatic and edaphic conditions and (when used to control the growth of weeds in crop-growing areas) the nature of the crops. When applied to a crop-growing area, the rate of application should be sufficient to control the growth of weeds without causing substantial permanent damage to the crop. In general, taking these factors into account, application rates of from about 500 g and 2500 g of the urea herbicide and from about 10 g to about 500 g of (b) per hectare give good results. However, it is to be understood that higher or lower application rates may be used, depending upon the particular problem of weed control encountered.<br><br>
The urea herbicide and (b) in combination may be used to control selectively the growth of weeds, for example to control the growth of those species hereinafter mentioned, by pro- or post- emergence application in a directional or non-directional fashion, e.g. by directional or non-directional spraying, to a locus of weed infestation which is an area used, or to be used, for growing crops, for example cereals, e.g. wheat, barley, oats, rye, maize and rice, soya beans, field and dwarf beans, peas, lucerne, cotton, peanuts, flax, onions, carrots, oilseed rape, sunflower, and permanent or sown grassland before or after sowing of the crop or before or after emergence of the crop. For the selective control of weeds at a locus of weed infestation which is an area used, or to be used, for the growing of crops, e.g. the crops hereinbefore mentioned, application rates of from about 500 g to about 2500 g of the urea herbicide and from about 25 g to about 200 g of (b) per hectare are particularly suitable.<br>
The method described above may be used to control a very wide spectrum of annual broad-leafed weeds and grass weeds. Examples of weeds which may be controlled include:<br>
broad-leafed weeds, for example, Abutilon theonhrastL<br>

herbicidejan enolic tautomeric form thereof, or an agriculturally acceptable salt or<br>
metal complex thereof;<br>
in association with an agriculturally acceptable diluent and/or carrier.<br>
Generally the active ingredients are homogeneously dispersed in other components cited hereinafter, such as a diluent or carrier and/or surface-active agents.<br>
The term "herbicidal compositions" is used in a broad sense, to include not only compositions which are ready for use as herbicides but also concentrates which must be diluted before use. Preferably the composition* contain from O.OS to 90% by weight of (a) and (b).<br>
Hie herbicidal composition may contain solid and liquid carriers and surface-active agents (e.g. welters, dispenants or emulsifiers alone or in combination). Surface-active agents that may be present in the herbicidal compositions of the present invention may be of the ionic or non-ionic types, for example sulphoricinoleates, quaternary ammonium derivatives, products based on condensates of ethylene oxide with nonyl- or octyl-phenols, or carboxylic acid esters of anhydrosorbitols which have been rendered soluble by etherification of the free hydroxy<br><br>
groups by condensation with ethylene oxide, alkali and alkaline earth metal salts of sulphuric acid esters and sulphonic acids such as dii»nyl-and dioctyl-sodium sulphono-succinates and alkali and alkaline earth metal salts of high molecular weight sulphonic acid derivatives such as sodium and calcium lignosulphonates. Examples of suitable solid diluents or carriers'are aluminium silicate, talc, calcined magnesia, kieselguhr, uicalcium phosphate, powdered cork, absorbent carbon black and clays such as kaolin and bentonite. Examples of suitable<br>
liquid diluents include water, acetophenone, cyclohexanone, isophorone, toluene, xylene, and mineral, animal, and vegetable oils (these diluents may be used alone or in combination).<br>
Herbicidal compositions according to the present invention may also contain, if desired, conventional adjuvants such as adhesives, protective colloids, thickeners, penetrating agents, stabilisers, sequestering agents, anti-caldng agents, colouring agents and corrosion inhibitors. These adjuvants may also serve as carriers or diluents.<br>
Preferred herbicidal compositions according to the present invention are wettable powders or water dispersible granules. Most preferred herbicidal compositions are aqueous suspension concentrates.<br>
The wettable powders (or powders for spraying) usually contain from 20 to 95% of combination, and they usually contain, in addition to the solid vehicle, from 0 to 5% of a wetting agent, from 3 to 10% of a dispersant agent and if necessary, from 0 to 10% of one or more stabilisers and/or other additives such as penetrating agents, adhesives or anti-caking agents and colourings.<br>
The aqueous suspension concentrates, which are applicable by spraying, are prepared in such a way as to obtain a stable fluid product (by fine grinding) which does not settle out and they usually contain from 10 to 75% of combination, from 0.5 to 15% of surface acting agents, from 0.1 to 10% of thixotropic agents, from 0 to 10% of suitable additives such as antifoams, corrosion inhibitors, stabilisers, and water<br>
or an organic liquid in which the active substance is sparingly soluble or insoluble. Some organic solid substances or inorganic salts can be dissolved in order to assist in preventing sedimentation or as antifreeze for the water,<br>
Herbicidal compositions according to the present invention may also comprise (a) and (b) in association with, and preferably homogeneously dispersed in, one or more other pesticidally active compounds and, if desired one or more compatible pesticidally acceptable diluents and carriers. Examples of other pesticidally active ingredients include fungicides, insecticides, plant growth regulators and, most preferably, herbicides. Examples of additional herbicides which may be present include the following (a mixture of urea herbicides may be used in the invention): chloroacetamides (e.g. metolachlor, acetochlor, alachlor), sulfonylureas, fhiocarbamates, dithiocarbamates, metribuzin, sulfentrazone, flumetsulam, clorasulam-methyl, oxasulfuron, flumiclorac, bentazon, chlorimuron, linuron, clomazone, dimethenamid, pendimethalin, trifluralin, clethodim and acifluorfen, bifenox, difluftnican, diuron, atrazine and ametryne.<br>
The following examples illustrate the invention without limiting it.<br>
Example 1<br>
The following tost was conducted in Brazil. Tebuthiuron (used as the commercial formulation "Combine™", a suspension concentrate containing 1,01/ha active ingredient) and 5-cyclopropyl-4-(2-methylsulphonyl-4-trifluoromethyl)benzoylisoxazole (isoxaflutole, hereafter referred to as Compound A), which was formulated as a wcttable granules, were sprayed alone and in tank mix combination (spray rate 3001/ha) to a plot 5 metres by 3 metres pro-emergence of the weeds and ratoon sugarcane (varieties RB72 454 and RB83 5089). The soil was a heavy clay soil containing 1.8% organic matter, 69% sand and 28% clay (ph 5.3) and had been sown on the same day as application with the weed tpeeies (the application was made to the ratoon cane<br>
about 90 days after cutting and before re-growth). Visual assessment was made 95 days after treatment in comparison with an untreated control plot Two replicates were performed.<br>
The results were as follows (in the Table that follows the weed and crops are represented by their Bayer codes):<br>
