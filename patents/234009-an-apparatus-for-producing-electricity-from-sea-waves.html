				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
In modern age there is a need for ceaseless electricity to maintain our daily<br>
livelihood as well as the rapid industrialization all over the world. For this reason I have<br>
thought about a source, which is natural, unlimited and free from pollution i.e. sea wave,<br>
to turn this problems out aside. Not only that but also it is very simple in construction<br>
easy to operate and the recurring expense is negligible too. To produce electricity from<br>
sea-wave we have to set up an apparatus on a sea-shore like 'Bay of Bengal" where wave<br>
are generally seen to rise and retain maximum thrust. In this way we will be able to<br>
minimize the problems of our coming generations.<br>
The object of this invention is to turn out the above problems aside by producing<br>
electricity forever. Not only that but also it is easy in construction, free from pollution,<br>
easy to operate and the recurring expenses are negligible too.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE APPARATUS<br>
A turbine with blade made of fibre glass type (for less weight) moves round upon<br>
ball-bearings. A frame holds this turbine with ball-bearing, oil-seal, and spindle. A<br>
sprocket is there at the centre of the turbine. An automatic gearbox is kept above the<br>
turbine. The gearbox is fixed in the frame with nut-bolts where a slide-channel is for<br>
adjusting the gearbox for looseness of roller-chains. The gearbox with two movable<br>
sprockets shown outside is connected with inside penions. The roller-chain connected<br>
the turbine sprocket to gearbox input sprocket. An another roller chain connects gearbox<br>
output sprocket to freewheel of propeller shaft (drive shaft) which are assembled in the<br>
same level, so that roller-chain does not sleep-down.<br>
A propeller shaft at the top of the frame moves upon ball-bearing and it is only one<br>
across every frame joined with coupling. A free wheel with adjusting pulley is fixed with<br>
propeller shaft (drive shaft) where the free wheel and the sprocket of output power of the<br>
gearbox is in a same line connected with roller-chain, propeller shaft (drive shaft) of<br>
each frame is joined by cross-bearing and yogh-teeth for up-down or bent beach. "Free<br>
wheel" is a preventive wheel which does not transfer the power of propeller shaft (drive<br>
shaft) to any slow moving turbine. Here pulley with bolt is an adjusting item of free<br>
wheel which is adjusted in a selected place of propeller shaft (drive shaft) and connects<br>
with roller-chain through gearbox to propeller shaft (drive shaft), otherwise the roller-<br>
chain will sleep down.<br>
Cylindrical (like pipe) four legs of the frame with adjusting system adjusts the up<br>
and down position of the frame.<br>
An extra wave-guard is used in front of the frame, otherwise extra wave will reach<br>
the centre of the turbine and the turbine can not move.<br>
The wheels and the catchers at the end of the frame roll on the rail which is set up on<br>
beach by piling rail pole. We can pull or push total construction by adjusting system at<br>
the time of high-tide and low-tide.<br>
The automatic gearbox consists of four penions and a half-round plate and its inside<br>
is filled up with lubricant. The inside of the gearbox has two partitions with hole for<br>
passing lubricant. The turbine moves sometimes clockwise and sometimes anticlockwise<br>
but the gearbox controls this movement in one direction (anticlockwise). In the gearbox<br>
out of the four penions two penions are linked with the input sprocket and output<br>
sprocket with ball-bearing. The remaining two penions rotate on the half-round plate<br>
which is moved in the partition by nut-bolt and washer for free movement but without<br>
tolerance. That half-round plate is moved in a restricted way but not in full.<br>
Here the movement of the half-round plate is restricted by two extra stakes which is<br>
enlarged stake where two penions are set up in moving conditions on the half-round plate<br>
and that extra stake enter into two holes in the partition. In this way half-round plate<br>
cannot move fully. When the input penion which is in the upper side of the plate moves<br>
anticlockwise, three penions are in action and the ultimate output rotates the output<br>
penion i.e. anticlockwise but when input penion rotates clockwise, four penions are in<br>
action and the output penion rotates anticlockwise.<br>
Thus we always get anticlockwise movement by connecting dynamo and will be<br>
able to produce electricity.<br>
However all ball bearings, cross bearings and yogh-teeth are lubricated by grease<br>
and covered by oil-seal which resist water.<br>
The up-down positions of the frame are adjusted in such a way that water cannot<br>
reach the centre of the turbine hub. The operation is very easy. Only an adjusting bolt is<br>
used to perform the action of pulling and pushing the total construction in the time of low<br>
tide and high tide.<br>
HOW TO INCREASE THE PRODUCTION OF ELECTRICITY<br>
Thus many frames with turbines and propeller shaft (drive shaft) are connected with<br>
coupling side by side and at last it will collect a huge power by connecting dynamo at<br>
some galloping position, we will be able to produce electricity. The length of turbine<br>
depends upon the depth of sea. Horse-power depends upon breadth of turbine-blade and<br>
R.P.M. depends upon radius of turbine sprocket or gear box output sprocket.<br>
DESCRIPTION IN REFERRENCE TO THE DRAWING<br>
Now the invention will be more clearly described with reference to the drawing<br>
Figure XL which shows one unit of the total project In drawing "wave" indicates the<br>
front side of the unit where sea-wave thrusts to move turbine (8). The back side of the<br>
unit is indicated by adjusting bolt (7) which is held by piling rail pole (21) and used to<br>
pull-push the unit through the threaded frame clamp (22). Turbines (8) are hanged by<br>
spindle and rotated on ball-bearing with oil-seal. A sprocket (5) is joined at the centre of<br>
the turbine. An automatic gearbox (10) is fixed up with nut-bolt and adjusted with slide-<br>
channel above the turbine gearbox input sprocket is connected through roller-chain with<br>
the turbine sprocket (5). Another roller-chain (1) is connected from gearbox output<br>
sprocket (9) to free wheel (13) of the propeller shaft (drive shaft-12). The propeller shaft<br>
(drive shaft-12) is hung from frame with ball-bearing and bearing holder with oil-seal<br>
(11). Every unit is joined by coupling, cross bearing (14) and yogh-teeth (15). A<br>
dynamo (16) is connected to propeller shaft (drive shaft) by sprocket with roller chain<br>
adjusting (23) pulley to line up the dynamo (16) with propeller shaft (drive shaft) it<br>
would be set up by keeping a certain distance to produce electricity.<br>
An extra wave-guard (18) is there in front of the unit, to resist the large wave which<br>
may be created as an obstacle to move the turbine. The wave guard (18) is fixed at a<br>
height of the frame so that the sea-wave can not reach to hub of the turbine.<br>
The frame looks like a double thatched shed with four cylindrical legs (like pipe).<br>
The lower part of the pipe (20) can enter the upper part of the pipe (19) to adjust the<br>
height of the frame. An adjusting bolt (No 4) adjusts the height of the frame according to<br>
the water level which affects on the turbine which effects on the turbine. The lower<br>
clamp has a thread and the upper has a channel which holds the bolt. In the back side of<br>
the frame another adjusting bolt (7) will push or pull the total frame where a threaded<br>
clamp (22) is fixed with the frame and the other side a rail pole holds this bolt by piling<br>
rail pole to adjust total structure at the time of high tide and low tide. There are four<br>
individual wheels (2) with catcher (24) at the end of the frame to role on rail (3). The<br>
said catcher (24) is made of two bent plate which are fixed with leg wheel by nut-bolt and<br>
caught the rail-line, otherwise the total structure will be derailed.<br>
In Figure AA and an automatic gearbox has been shown. It has four clamps fixed<br>
with nut-bolt (b) where slide-channel (a) adjusts the proper position of the gearbox. The<br>
automatic gearbox has two partitions (O) &amp; (M). The input sprocket (x) of the gearbox<br>
makes to move the internal input penions (n) by an axel (e) which moves upon two ball-<br>
bearing (P) &amp; (Q).<br>
In other side output sprocket (y) rotates by internal output penions (m) and transmits<br>
by axel (e) upon ball-bearing (L) &amp; (G).<br>
In partition (O) there is display of penions in various functions and operations<br>
shown in Figure no- (C) &amp; (D). In partition (O) 'n' is input penions, 'm' is output penion<br>
and 'k' &amp; '1' penions are on a half round plate (d) on which they are very close to each<br>
other. When input penion (n) rounds clockwise, other penion (1) comes close to the<br>
penion (n) by moving the half round plate (d) penion (k) is always involved with penion<br>
(m). The ultimate result is penion (n) moves clockwise, penion (1) anticlockwise, penion<br>
(k) clockwise and penion (m) anticlockwise. On the other hand, when the input penion<br>
(n) moves anticlockwise other penion (1) is beaten back. Thus penion (k) comes close to<br>
the penion (n), (1) &amp; (m). The ultimate result is -penion (n) moves anticlockwise, penion<br>
(k) clockwise and penion (m) anticlockwise. So always I get output result in<br>
anticlockwise movement. But what is there in the half round plate and the partition and<br>
how it works?<br>
In Figure no-G; there is a view of a half round plate (d), where (c) is a bore to<br>
connect this plate to the partition with nut-bolt and washer for easy movement without<br>
tolerance. In this half round plate (d), (s) &amp; (f) are fixed type stake on which penion He'<br>
&amp; T move. These stakes pass through the other side of the half round plate (d). These<br>
extra part of the stake's' &amp; 'f will enter the bore channel 'g' &amp; 'h' shown in the Figure<br>
A. In this way two way movement of the input sprocket will be transformed into<br>
unidirectional movement.<br>
In Figure CD a free wheel with adjusting pulley connects with propeller shaft by<br>
adjusting pulley and nut-bolt. Gearbox drives the propeller shaft (drive shaft) via free<br>
wheel by roller-chain. Free wheel moves in one direction. In Figure CD 'q' is inner<br>
tooth of a free wheel and r is ratchet which is swallowed by the teeth by which it may<br>
move in one direction. There is adjusting pulley with nut-bolts 'T' &amp; ' W. A free wheel<br>
has two parts roll upon ball-bearing with each other.<br>
In Figure GH View A' is an inner view of a yogh-teeth at Sec. Z. Here teeth will<br>
enter the yogh hole and in this way more propeller shafts (drive shafts) may be adjoined<br>
with one another whatever may be the distance.<br>
In Figure GH Sec. X is a coupling which joins the propeller shaft (drive shaft) with<br>
one another by nut-bolt. Sec. Y is a cross bearing which helps the propeller shaft (drive<br>
shaft) to move frequently on up-down beach.<br>
In Figure UV there is a bearing holder with oil-seal which holds bearing with grease<br>
and is fixed with the frame with nut-bolt.<br>
In Figure MN there is a side view of turbine, gearbox and propeller shaft (drive<br>
shaft) where free wheel connects and shows how to move everything.<br>
In Figure QR the front view of the total project has been shown. Moreover, the<br>
movements of the turbine, the action of the gearbox and the function of the propeller<br>
shaft (drive shaft) have been described clearly.<br>
WORKING OF THE APPARATUS<br>
One by one unit of the total project (shown in Figure XL) is placed on individual<br>
pair of rail line (3) which is set up on the sea-beach by piling rail-pole. The adjusting<br>
bolt (7) is connected with clamp (22) and stake (21). The propeller shaft (drive shaft)<br>
(12) of every unit is connected by coupling with nut-bolt. The height of the turbine is<br>
adjusted according to water level by adjusting bolt (4) and then the bolt (7) adjusts<br>
according to the thrust of the wave. We can adjust the unit at that place where wave are<br>
seen to rise and exist maximum thrust. In Figure XL wave of the sea thrusts to the<br>
turbine (8) at the time when waves come and returns back. Turbine moves sometimes<br>
clockwise and sometimes anticlockwise. There is a sprocket (5) at the hub of the turbine<br>
which transmits this power to the automatic gearbox (10) by a roller-chain. Input<br>
sprocket (9) of the gearbox (10) transmits this power in the inner penion which sink<br>
under lubricant of the automatic gearbox (10) and help to get a unidirectional movement<br>
of the output penion i.e. anticlockwise. This unidirectional movement transmits this<br>
power to free wheel (13) of propeller shaft (drive shaft-12) by roller-chain (1). The free<br>
wheel (13) never transmits the restoring power of propeller shaft (drive shaft-12) to any<br>
other slow moving turbine. A dynamo (16) which is used by keeping some certain<br>
distance of several units is moved by propeller shaft (drive shaft) to produce electricity.<br>
This apparatus of producing electricity is generally functional at "Bay of Bengal"<br>
where waves are seen to rise and to hold maximum thrust but it is inactive in calm-sea.<br>
In this way several sets of turbine in this apparatus will be able to generate the required<br>
amount of electricity. Thus this apparatus has a potential of generating considerable<br>
amount of electricity through dynamo, proportionately with the number of unit used.<br>
The turbine moves upon ball bearing which is set on a spindle but ball-bearing<br>
covered with oil-seal to cause of resist water.<br>
In the gearbox, input and output sprocket make to move the input and output penion<br>
by shaft which move on double ball-bearing. Both the side of input and output ball-<br>
bearings are also protected by oil-seal for resistance of water and inner lubricant.<br>
There is a propeller shaft (drive shaft) per frame hung with ball-bearing and bearing<br>
holder where oil-seal resist rain water and inner grease. There is cross-bearing and yogh-<br>
teeth per frame lubricant with grease and cover with rubber bellow. The operation is very<br>
easy. Only an adjusting bolt is used per frame for pulling and pushing the total<br>
construction at the time of high tide and low tide.<br>
ADVANTAGES:<br>
1. Satisfactory supply of ever increasing demand of electricity in modern age.<br>
2. Preservation of national resources which are used for conventional source of<br>
energy.<br>
3. Minimum recurring expenses.<br>

I CLAIM:<br>
1. An apparatus for producing electricity from sea-wave comprising a steel-<br>
frame, huge bladed turbines (8), automatic gearbox (10), propeller shaft<br>
(drive shaft-12) and dynamo (16) fixed to the said frame, produces electricity<br>
when sea-wave thrusts upon the turbine (8) to make it rotate, transforms this<br>
kinetic power to an automatic gearbox (10) which produces an unidirectional<br>
output, is collected by a propeller shaft (drive shaft-12) and finally acquired<br>
by a dynamo (16) to produce electricity.<br>
2. The steel frame, as claimed in claim 1, looks like a double thatched shed<br>
consists of a wave-guard (front side-18) in order to resist the big wave to<br>
reach the upper portion of the hub of the turbine (8) and is set on rail line (3)<br>
with adjusting bolts (4) and catcher (24) to move the total frame during low-<br>
tide and high-tide.<br>
3. The huge-bladed turbine (8), as claimed in claim 1, accompanied with a<br>
sprocket (5) is movable on double ball-bearing (11) and spindle (17) with<br>
oil-seal to make it water resistant and connected to the input sprocket of the<br>
gearbox through the roller-chain (1).<br>
4. The gearbox (10), as claimed in claim 1, is provided a clockwise and<br>
anticlockwise input through input sprocket but the inbuilt four penions (k, 1,<br>
m, n) and a plate (d) are able to convert the movement into unidirectional i.e.<br>
anticlockwise and transfer it through another roller-chain (1) from output<br>
sprocket to a propeller shaft (drive shaft-12).<br>
5. The propeller shaft (drive shaft-12), as claimed in claim 4, moves on ball-<br>
bearing (11) accompanied with free wheel (13) to prevent it to transfer the<br>
power to any slow-moving turbine, are adjoined by cross-bearing (14) and<br>
yogh-teeth (15) to avoid the difficulties caused by the lack of uniformity of<br>
the sea-beach and thus it is able to collect a huge amount of kinetic energy<br>
from so many moving turbines (8).<br>
6. The propeller shaft (drive shaft-12), as claimed in claim 5, transfers this<br>
kinetic energy to dynamo (16) to produce electricity.<br>
7. An apparatus for producing electricity from sea-wave is herein described<br>
with reference to and is illustrated in the accompanying drawing.<br><br>
A turbine moves by powerful sea-waves and turbine<br>
transmits this power to gearbox through chain. Gearbox<br>
controls the two way movements of sea waves into uni-<br>
directional movement . Then gearbox transmits this power<br>
through chain to propeller shaft where total power of the<br>
whole project is collected. The propeller shaft can move<br>
a dynamo which produce a large amount of electricity.<br>
Four cylindrical legs with four rolling wheels of<br>
the construction frame is role on rail. Cylindrical legs<br>

a half-round plate (like protector which is in geometry box)<br>
½ fill up with lubricant. The inside of the gearbox have<br>
2 partitions. The turbine moves round sometime clockwise,<br>
sometime anti-clockwise but the gearbox controls this move-<br>
ment in one direction i.e., anti-clockwise.<br></td>
