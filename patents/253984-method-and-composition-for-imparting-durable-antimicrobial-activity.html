DISINFECTANT WITH DURABLE ACTIVITY BASED ON ALCOHOL-SOLUBLE QUATERNARY AMMONIUM POLYMERS AND COPOLYMERS<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to disinfectants for surfaces, including skin, that provide sustained antimicrobial activity for prolonged periods following their application to the surface<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Human and animal health can be adversely affected by many microorganisms, including bacteria, yeasts, viruses, fungi, mold, and protozoa. Human and animal contact with microorganisms is known to cause a wide variety of diseases, illnesses, and ailments.<br>
It is well known that the washing of hard surfaces (e.g. food preparation surfaces and surgical room equipment), food (e.g. fruits and vegetables), and skin (e.g. hands) with soap and water, can remove many microorganisms from those surfaces. Removal of microorganisms by hand washing with soap is largely due to a combination of the surfactancy of the soap and the mechanical action of the washing procedure. Because washing with soap is effective at removing a substantial number of microorganisms already present, but has only a minimal, if any, lasting or persistent effect on microorganisms that subsequently come into contact with the already washed hands, it is often recommended that people wash their hands frequently in order to reduce the spread of viruses, bacteria, and other<br><br>
Microorganisms. Compliance with this recommendation is important for an individual's personal health and hygiene, but is especially important for individuals working in the health and food industries.<br>
Antimicrobial cleansing products for the removal of microorganisms from surfaces, including skin, are available in a variety of types. The most common types utilized for personal hygiene and by personnel working in the health and food industries, include those containing soaps and those containing alcohol.<br>
Traditional rinse-off disinfectant products, such as detergents and soaps, are generally effective at reducing the number of microorganisms present on a surface when proper procedures are employed. For example, Dial® liquid soaps containing triclosan, when used for hand washing, have been shown to reduce the number of bacteria present on the skin by about 2.0-2,5 orders of magnitude (99.0-99.7%) after one 30-second handwash, as measured by standard Health Care Personal Handwash Tests (HCPHWT), In other words, after washing, the washed skin is contaminated with only 0.3%"1.0% of the number of bacteria than was the unwashed skin before the 30-second handwash. Although, when used properly, soaps are capable of removing the majority of bacteria that are present, the persistence of any antimicrobial activity remaining on the surface is minimal, so immediately following hand washing, re-contamination of the hands begins to occur through contact with other contaminated surfaces. In addition, because these traditional rinse-off disinfectant products were developed for use in a washing procedure that uses a substantial amount of water; their use is limited to locations where a substantial amount of water is available.<br>
Another commonly used type of disinfectant are those products containing relatively high levels of alcohol. Alcohol-based disinfectants result in the immediate removal or inactivation of a substantial portion of microorganisms present on the treated surface. Disinfectants based on alcohol, typically ethanol, have an additional advantage as disinfectants because alcohol readily evaporates<br><br>
from the skin at body temperature. Purcell® is one example of a skin disinfectant that uses alcohol as the active ingredient. Again, although properly applied alcohol-based disinfectants are generally effective at removing or destroying bacteria that are present on the skin prior to application, immediately following treatment, re-contamination of treated skin begins to occur through contact with other contaminated surfaces.<br>
Recent studies indicate that alcohol-based sanitizers with less than approximately 60% alcohol content may not be suitable to provide a desirable degree of antimicrobial activity, and alcohol contents above 95% are also less potent because proteins are not denatured easily in the absence of water ["Hand Hygiene Revisited: Another Look at Hand Sanitizers and Antibacterial Soap " SAFEFOOD NEWS - Spring 2004 - Vol 8 No. 3, Colorado State University Cooperative Extension].<br>
Other water-soluble active ingredients have been used in skin disinfectants, instead of, or in combination with, alcohol. Bimbaum et al., (U.S. Pat. 6,441,045) disclose a water-soluble quaternary compound for use as a skin disinfectant. Beers et al., (U.S. Pat. 6,217,887) disclose an antimicrobial composition for skin that is meant to be left-on rather than rinsed-off, which contains an antimicrobial active, an anionic surfactant, a proton-donating agent, in a solution containing up to 98.85% water, Petersen et al., (U.S. Pat. 6,627,207) disclose a water-based, quick-drying, gel-type disinfecting composition having a low alcohol content (
 <br>
6,180,584) disclose a disinfectant composition comprised of a polymeric, film-forming material and a metallic biocide in a carrier, which, when applied to a surface, forms a water-insoluble polymeric film on the surface in which the biocide is non-leachably bound to, complexed with, associated with, or dispersed.<br>
Caisson et aK, (U.S. Pat. 5,869,600) disclose the use of water-insoluble, alcohol-soluble copolymers containing some level of quaternary ammonium groups for use as film-forming polymers utilized as antiperspirants.<br>
Other approaches have employed methods that attach reactive silane-based quaternary ammonium compounds to particular substrates via a siloxane bond. For example, AEGIS Environments' product line includes products that utilize polymers of 3-(trimethoxysilyl)propyldimethyloctadecyl ammonium chloride, and are generally applied using alcohol-based solutions. According to product literature, AEM 5700 is 43% 3-(trimethoxysilyl) propyldimethyloctadecyl ammonium chloride in methanol, which can be used to coat the surface of textiles and other objects. This method results in the formation of a permanent covalent bond between the quaternary ammonium antimicrobial compound and the surface being treated. Removal of the applied antimicrobial is thus nearly impossible, even using alcohol-based solvents. Furthermore, the reactive trimethoxysilyl compounds are toxic and not suitable for use on skin.<br>
Sawan (U.S. Pat. 6264936) describes an antimicrobial material which can be used to form on the surface of a substrate an antimicrobial coating or layer which kills microorganisms on contact. The antimicrobial coating or layer, characterized in the reference as 'non-leaching," is a combination of an organic matrix immobilized on the surface of the substrate to having biocidal metallic materials associated with the matrix. When a microorganism contacts the coating or layer, the biocidal metallic material is transferred to the microorganism in amounts sufficient to kill it. Specifically, the metallic antimicrobial agent used is silver. Although this method purports to provide a "non-leachable" coating, the<br><br>
mere fact that the metallic antimicrobial agent "is transferred" to the microorganism is contrary to the common definition of non-leachable. Furthermore, it is known that although silver and silver salts have very low solubility, the mechanism of antimicrobial activity is dependent on a finite solution concentration of silver ions. Indeed, Sawan later (column 3, line 9) qualifies the above statement to read "substantially low leachables". In a preferred embodiment of Sawan's patent, the organic material comprises a polyhexamethylene biguanide polymer which is crosslinked with an epoxide, such as N,N-bismethylene diglycidylaniline, to form a crosslinked network or matrix. This crosslinking step is necessary to prevent dissolution of the matrix. The materials described by Sawan generally require a curing step, generally in the range of SO*' to HO,'C, which is unsuitable for many substrates, particularly human skin. Furthermore, the preferred organic matrix polymer (polyhexamethylene biguanide) is known to be toxic to human cells in high concentrations (see U.S. Pat, 6,369,289 BI). The use of silver as an antimicrobial agent also incurs some undesirable effects. One disadvantage to this approach is that certain bacteria have been able to develop resistance to silver. (Silver S., ,'Bacterial silver resistance: molecular biology and uses and misuses of silver compounds."' FEMS Microbiology Reviews, 2003; 27:341-353). Another disadvantage to this approach is that diffusing silver may be able to enter the wound and may potentially stain the skin. An additional disadvantage of silver is the high cost of the raw material. Similar approaches are described in U.S. Pats. 6,180,584; 6,126,931; 6,030632; 5,869,073, 5,849,311; and 5,817,325.<br>
There is a need for improved means and methods for disinfecting surfaces, not only for improved personal hygiene, but also to reduce potential sources of contamination in both health and food industries. With currently used non-persistent disinfectants, personnel in the health industry (e.g. doctors, nurses, and patients) and the food industry (e.g. food handlers, food prepares, cooks, and servers) must apply a disinfectant, such as soap, to their skin several, and sometimes 20 or more times, a day. Consequently, there exists a need, for<br><br>
personal hygiene and hygiene within the health and food industries, for a disinfectant that can effectively sanitize a surface and persist actively on that surface to combat microorganisms that subsequently come into contact with the treated surface.<br>
The need for an effective, persistent surface disinfectant is feh in all aspects of the health industry. It is an aspect of the current invention that the invention would be useful to disinfect skin prior to surgery, injection, phlebotomy, and catheter insertion. Microorganisms present a threat to the health and safety of patients whenever the skin is penetrated, broken, or breached. For example, such pathogens may be a hazard during surgical procedures. Without adequate disinfection of the incision site prior to surgery, microorganisms present on the skin gain access to the incision during or following surgery and cause infection. To prevent such infections, it is critical to disinfect the incision site prior to surgery with a disinfectant that possesses a high antimicrobial activity and a broad spectrum of action. Since surgical procedures can last for many hours, it is also important that the initial disinfection of the incision site persists and provides sustained antimicrobial activity for an extended period of time. In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration requires that a pre-surgical skin disinfectant be capable of reducing the number of flora on dry skin areas, such as an abdomen, by at least 2.5 orders of magnitude or to levels that are too low for reliable quantification (less than about 25 cfu/cm,). On moist skin, such as inguinal areas, the disinfectant must reduce the initial bacterial population by a minimum of 3.2 logs (1.5 x 10", cfu/mL) and be able to maintain this level for at least four hours*<br>
The need for an effective, persistent, and durable surface disinfectant is also felt in all aspects of the food industry, including food collection (e.g. sanitation of cow teats), food processing (e.g. slaughterhouses), food packaging (e.g. fish canneries), and food distribution (e.g. restaurants and food stores). It is an aspect of the current invention that the composition would be useful wherever a<br><br>
person has food handling responsibilities and particularly useful wherever proper hygiene is made difficult because the same individual has both food handling and money handling responsibilities (e.g. deli shop cashiers and wait staff).<br>
The ability of many organisms to develop resistance to antimicrobial compounds Is a serious problem. Reports of rampant infections from organisms such as methacillin-resistant Stash aurous (MSRA) abound in the news media. Such resistance is known to occur for many antibiotics, as well as for metal-based systems (such as silver). Quaternary ammonium compounds, on the other hand, do not promote development of resistant organisms.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
One exemplary embodiment of the current invention utilizes an antimicrobial polymer having polymeric molecules that are composed of one type of monomeric moiety; alternatively, the polymeric molecules may be composed of more than one type of monomeric moiety. In exemplary embodiments of the current invention, quaternary ammonium moieties impart antimicrobial activity to the polymeric molecules. Desirably such quaternary ammonium-containing monomeric moieties constitute at least 2% by weight of the polymeric molecules, more preferably at least 10% of the polymeric molecules, and most preferably at least 25% of the polymeric molecules. Preferably, the number of quaternary ammonium moieties in the antimicrobial polymer will be at least one mole (6.02 x 10  ) per 650 grams of polymer. More preferably, the number of quaternary ammonium moieties in the antimicrobial polymer will be at least one mole (6.02 x 10,,) per 350 grams of polymer,<br>
The antimicrobial polymer is formulated to be insoluble in water and readily soluble in aqueous solutions of at least 75 wt % alcohol. More preferably it<br><br>
is formulated to be insoluble in water and is readily soluble in such solutions of at least 50 wt % alcohol, and most preferably it is formulated to be insoluble in water and readily soluble in solutions of at least 25 wt % alcohol.   It is an aspect of the current invention that the antimicrobial polymer can be applied to surfaces, including skin, dissolved in an alcohol-containing solvent.<br>
The relative solubility of polymers in different solvents is not trivial. This invention pertains to polymers that are soluble in alcohol, yet insoluble in water* This specific combination of properties is manifested in only a relatively small number of the many different types of known natural and synthetic polymers. Polymers may generally be divided into two groups: water-soluble, and water-insoluble. Some water-insoluble polymers may be soluble in various organic solvents. Solubility generally depends on the properties of the particular polymer-solvent combination, with soluble combinations resulting when the chemical structures of the polymer and solvent are similar* Polarity of the solvent is perhaps the most important consideration. Polarity of some common solvents in order of most polar to least polar are: water, ethanol, ether, toluene, and hexane. Many water-soluble polymers are also soluble in alcohol. Among the alcohols, the polarity decreases in the order of methanol, ethanol, and isopropanol, with the polarity of methanol being closest to that of water. Thus, many water-soluble polymers are more soluble in methanol, than in ethanol or isopropanol. Ethanol and isopropanol are preferred solvents for the practice of this invention. Isopropanol is not generally a very good solvent for most polymers* Even polyethylene oxide, which is highly soluble in water, is insoluble in isopropanol, as are many other water-soluble polymers such as polyDADMAC, alginate, polyacrylate, and even poly(vinyl alcohol). The vast majority of both natural and synthetic polymers are not soluble in isopropanol The further requirement that the polymer also be insoluble in water makes the selection of useful polymers for the practice of this invention even more critical.<br><br>
The alcohol-containing solvent may serve a two-fold purpose, not only as a carrier, but also as an immediate disinfectant* After the alcohol-containing solvent has evaporated, a coating of the antimicrobial polymer remains on the skin or other substrate. This coating is durable, and because it is insoluble in water, it Is not easily removed by, for example, perspiration, incidental contact with aqueous fluids, or light washing with aqueous fluids.<br>
It is an aspect of the current invention that an alcohol Is used as solvent and as carrier, including, but not limited to, ethanol, methanol, isopropanol, and mixtures thereof. It is an aspect of one exemplary embodiment of the invention that the alcohol solvent is denatured alcohol, specifically Denatured Alcohol SDA 3-C, which is a commercial, non-beverage grade, denatured alcohol defined by the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax Division of the Internal Revenue Service as ethanol with a 5% isopropanol denaturant (ix., 95% ethanol/5% isopropanol).<br>
The antimicrobial polymer may also be soluble in other organic solvents such as acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, tetrahydrofuran, ethyl acetate, ethers, esters, benzene, toluene, carbonates, hydrocarbons, or chlorinated hydrocarbons, and solutions of the antimicrobial polymer in any of these solvents may be used to prepare the antimicrobial composition; however, these solvents may not necessarily provide the advantage of immediate disinfection such as provided by alcohol.<br>
It is a feature of this invention that the antimicrobial properties are permanently locked into the polymer structure. This can be accomplished, for example, by incorporating chemical functionalities with antimicrobial properties directly into the molecular structure of the polymer. This provides not only durability and persistence of antimicrobial effect, but also prevents soluble antimicrobial components, e.g. those of low molecular weight, from leaching from the antimicrobial coating and entering the substrate, or migrating to areas where it is not desirable to have antimicrobial activity. For instance, when applied to skin,<br><br>
the composition will provide persistent antimicrobial activity; however, antimicrobial activity will not migrate from the polymer and penetrate the skin surface or enter into cells where it may have undesirable effects, after evaporation of the alcohol-based carrier solvent.<br>
It is an advantage of the current invention that the composition would be useful to protect individuals at risk of contacting biological warfare agents (e.g. military personnel and postal workers), either by treating their skin or by treating the surfaces of equipment and materials that these individuals contact.<br>
It is an aspect of the current invention that a composition of the present invention may be used on animal skin (e.g. sanitization of cow teats, surgical procedures, and veterinary procedures).<br>
An advantage of this invention is that it utilizes quaternary ammonium compounds as the active antimicrobial agent, and quaternary ammonium compounds do not promote the development of resistant organisms such as MRS A or VRE. Examples are provided below to demonstrate the efficacy of the materials of the current invention against such organisms.<br>
The disinfectant composition of the present invention may additionally contain other inert or active ingredients. For example, thickening agents may be included in order to increase viscosity or to provide a gel form of the product. Additives, such as moisturizers, vitamins, UV absorbers, drugs, antimicrobials, or other inert and active agents, may also be added. Such additives do not need to be water-insoluble, as they may serve their purpose by acting transiently or otherwise may be entrapped in the polymeric coating and thereby stabilized against easy removal by aqueous fluids. In addition, permanent or temporary dyes may be added to the composition, or alternatively applied to the polymeric coating after it has been applied to the surface, in order to serve as a visual indicator of the presence of the polymeric coating.<br><br>
Although the composition of the current invention provides a polymer film or coating with non-leaching antimicrobial properties, it may be desirable in some circumstances to incorporate an additional antimicrobial or antiseptic agent into the composition in order to provide additional efficacy* This additional agent is not covalently bonded to the polymer, and thus may be leachable. This does not alter the non-leachable nature of the previously-described antimicrobial polymer. When the additional antimicrobial agent has been fully leached from the composition, the antimicrobial polymer will still provide non-leachable antimicrobial activity* Furthermore, the antimicrobial polymer matrix can serve to slow the leaching rate of the additional agent, thus prolonging the efficacy of the added agent. Examples of useful antimicrobial or antiseptic additives include quaternary ammonium salts, biguanides, and phenolic compounds. In certain embodiments the added antimicrobial or antiseptic is a quaternary ammonium salt, such as benzalkonium chloride, benzethonium chloride, dimethyldidecylammonium chloride, or mixtures thereof.<br>
In another embodiment the added antimicrobial or antiseptic is a biguanide, such as chlorhexidine or poly(hexamethylene biguanide). In another embodiment, the added antimicrobial or antiseptic is a phenolic compound, such as phenol or triclosan.<br>
It is an aspect of the current invention that the composition may be formulated as a liquid, gel, foam, or aerosol spray and may be applied to a surface, including the skin of a human or other animal, in order to achieve a prolonged antimicrobial effect.<br>
The examples that follow demonstrate the synthesis and application of alcohol-soluble, water-insoluble, antimicrobial polymeric molecules. It is an aspect of the invention that these polymeric molecules can be synthesized by free radical vinyl polymerization of, generally, a mixture of two different monomers, a<br><br>
first monomer (A) and a second monomer (B), at least one of which contains quaternary ammonium groups. The first monomer (A), and homopolymers of monomer A, are generally water-soluble, while the second monomer (B) is generally water-insoluble, A mutually effective solvent (such as alcohol) for monomers A &amp; B may be used to prepare a homogeneous solution suitable for copolymerization of the two monomers. The copolymer of A + B, is soluble in alcohol. It should be understood that this is just one possible illustrative method to formulate the composition and one skilled in the art will realize that there are numerous other methods that can be used to prepare the alcohol-soluble, water-insoluble, antimicrobial polymeric molecules. Mixtures of three or more monomers may also be used to prepare suitable antimicrobial copolymers.<br>
It is an aspect of this invention that the polymeric molecules can be synthesized by step-growth polymerization, such as by the reaction of a difunctional alcohol with a diisocyanate to form a polyurethane polymer. It is an aspect of this invention that other types of step-growth polymers may also be utilized including, but not limited to, polyamides (nylons), polyesters, and polyureas. The incorporation of the antimicrobial moiety into the polymer may be accomplished by utilizing an antimicrobial compound with reactive functionality. For instance, Akzo Nobel offers a range of compounds sold under the trade-name of Ethoquad.  An example is Ethoquad C/12-75DK, which is a methyl/C12 quaternary ammonium compound with two reactive hydroxyethyl substituents that can be reacted with a diisocyanate such as tolylene-2,4-diisocyanate (TDI) to form an antimicrobial polyurethane polymer which contains quaternary ammonium moieties in the polymer main-chain structure.<br>
In one embodiment of this invention, a dye molecule may be incorporated into, or covalently bonded to, the antimicrobial polymer structure in order to provide a no leaching visible marker for the composition* For instance, the fluorescein dye molecule contains two hydroxyl groups which may be reacted with a diisocyanate to form part of a polyurethane structure. When a mixture of<br><br>
fluorescein and Ethoquad C/12-75DK is reacted with TDI, the resulting polymer contains both dye (fluorescein) and antimicrobial (quaternary ammonium) units in the polymer main-chain structure.<br>
The antimicrobial moieties may also be incorporated into the polymer after formation of the polymer This can be achieved, for example, by transesterification or other substitution reactions, such as the reaction of Ethoquad with a polyacrylate.<br>
The polymer molecules synthesized will have an average degree of polymerization of 5 to 25,000 (monomeric moieties per molecule), but more preferably 50 to 10,000, and most preferably 100 to 5000. Suitable vinyl monomers for use in generating the polymer include, but are not limited to, allyl-containing monomers, vinyl-containing monomers, styrene derivatives, allyl amines, ammonium salts, acrylates, methacrylates, acrylamides, methacrylamides, dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate (methyl chloride quaternary), dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate (benzyl chloride quaternary), dimethylaminoethyl acrylate (methyl chloride quaternary), dimethylaminoethyl acrylate (benzyl chloride quaternary), and other compounds with the structure CH2=CR-(C=0)-X-(CH2)n- N,R*R"R"VA,' (where R is hydrogen or methyl, n equals 2 or 3, X is either O, S, or NH, R', R", and R'" are independently selected from the group consisting of H, CI to CI6 alkyl, aryl, arylamine, alkaryl, and aralkyl, and Y" is an anionic counterion to the positive charge of the quaternary nitrogen; diallyldimethylammonium salts; vinyl pyridine and salts thereof; and vinylbenzyltrimethylammonium salts).<br>
Suitable free radical initiators for use in generating the polymer include, but are not limited to, ago compounds, such as AIBN and related compounds, and peroxides, such as benzoyl peroxide, dicetyl peroxide, t-butyl hydroperoxide, sodium persulfate, hydrogen peroxide, sodium peroxide, and other peroxides and hydroperoxides commonly used as free radical polymerization initiators.<br><br>
Photoinitiated polymerization may also be used wherein a suitable photolnitiator (e.g. a benzophenone derivative) is used which initiates polymerization upon exposure to light. Radiation polymerization may also be used, wherein polymerization is initiated by exposure to ionizing radiation (e.g. gamma rays).<br>
Various testing methods may be employed to measure the antimicrobial efficacy of the antimicrobial polymers and compositions described herein. The "Carrier Persistence Test", or CPT, is described below. The compositions and materials of this invention have been found to give excellent results when tested by the CPT* Reductions of bacterial populations generally exceed 6 logs (99.9999% reduction of viable organisms). The materials described by this invention are capable of producing a 3-log reduction of bacteria when tested using the CPT method. Preferably, the materials described by this invention are capable of producing a 4-log reduction of bacteria when tested using the CPT method* More preferably, the materials described by this invention are capable of producing a 5-log reduction of bacteria when tested using the CPT method. Still more preferably, the materials described by this invention are capable of producing a 6-log reduction of bacteria when tested using the CPT method* It should be understood that the CPT is a comparative test in which the antimicrobial materials are compared to control materials not treated with antimicrobial agent. The maximum theoretical log reduction obtainable in a particular CPT test is limited by the grow1;h of the bacterial population on the untreated control. Thus, it is possible to obtain virtually 100% elimination of viable organisms even though the actual log reduction is below a specified number.<br><br>
EXAMPLES<br>
The following Examples are provided to illustrate the invention and teach those skilled in the art how to make and how to use the subject matter. They are not to be read as limiting the scope of the invention.<br>
EXAMPLE Al: Co-polymerization of<br>
(2-(methacryloyloxy)ethyl)trimethylammonium chloride and butyl methacrylate.<br>
A solution was made by dissolving 2.5 grams of quaternary vinyl monomer (2-(methacryloyloxy)ethyl)trimethylammonium chloride 75% aqueous solution (Aldrich Chemical Co.)), 7.5 grams of butyl methacrylate (Aldrich Chemical Co.), and 0.1 gram or AIBN (2,2'-a2obis(2-methylpropionitrile) (Aldrich Chemical Co,) in 10 grams of ethanol. The solution was spared for 60 seconds with argon gas to expel dissolved oxygen and then sealed in a glass vial under an argon atmosphere* The vial was placed in a 70°C oven for 24 hours. The copolymer containing solution was then diluted in ethanol (1:25).<br>
EXAMPLE A2: Application of the composition to skin.<br>
Approximately 1 mL of the solution generated in Example Al was placed on the skin on the back of the hand of a human volunteer, then spread and rubbed with a gloved finger until dry. After drying, an inconspicuous film remained, which was not sticky or tacky, and was virtually imperceptible to the volunteer. Bromthymol blue (BTB) indicator dye is known to bind strongly to quaternary ammonium compounds. To visualize the presence of the polymeric coating, the area of the hand to which the polymer-containing solution was applied was rinsed with a 0.5% aqueous solution of BTB indicator dye adjusted to a pH 10. The hand was rinsed under tepid running tap water for 30 seconds with light digital manipulation to remove excess BTB indicator dye solution. The area of skin treated with the copolymer solution exhibited a blue/green color, while the surrounding skin did<br><br>
not, indicating presence of the applied polymer. Only after vigorous scrubbing with a detergent solution, was the coating diminished to the extent that the BTB Indicator dye assay no longer indicated the presence of the polymeric coating.<br>
EXAMPLE A3; Co-polymerization of (vinylbenzyl)trimethylaintnonium cliloride and butyl methacrylate (H-l),<br>
A solution was made by dissolving 2.5 grams of quaternary vinyl monomer (vinylbenzyl)trimethylammonium chloride (Aldrich Chemical Co.), 7*5 grams of butyl methacrylate (Aldrich Chemical Co.), and 0.1 grams of AIBN (2,2'-azobis(2-methylpropionitrile) (Aldrich Chemical Co.), in 20 grams of methanol. This solution was spared for 60 seconds with argon gas to expel dissolved oxygen, and then sealed in a glass vial under an argon atmosphere. The vial was placed in a 70*,C oven for 24 hours. The copolymer containing solution was then diluted in ethanol (1:2). This composition was designated as "H-l" and is referred to in subsequent examples.<br>
EXAMPLE A4: Application of the composition to polypropylene.<br>
The solution generated in Example A3 was used to coat the interior surface of several 15 mL polypropylene centrifuge tubes by filling them with the solution and leaving them filled overnight. The solution was then poured off and the alcohol was evaporated completely in a low temperature oven set to 50°C. To visualize the presence of polymeric coating on the inside of the tubes, approximately 5 mL of 0.5% aqueous solution of BTB indicator dye was added to one of the tubes and then shaken to coat the entire inside of the tube. After rinsing the tube several times with distilled water, the interior surface of the tube remained a deep blue color, indicating that the inner surface of the tube was coated with water-insoluble polymer.<br>
EXAMPLE A5: Antimicrobial activity of polymeric composition.<br><br>
A 2 mL aliquot of a lO""* dilution of an overnight culture of 5. aurous (--l x 10, CFU/mL) was added to one polypropylene centrifuge tube treated as in Example A4 (sample) and to one untreated polypropylene centrifuge tube (control). During overnight incubation at 37*,C, the tubes were slowly rolled to ensure contact between the bacteria culture and the interior surface of the tubes. The next day, serial dilutions of the bacteria cultures harvested from each tube were streaked onto bacteria culture plates. The culture harvested from the untreated control tube yielded 2.5 X 10, CFU, while zero colonies were observed on plates streaked with cultures harvested from the treated sample tubes. The difference In the number of colonies enumerated translates into at least a 4.4 log reduction in the bacterial population.<br>
EXAMPLE A6: Synthesis of a quaternary ammonium polyuretliane (H3-C) that is soluble in alcohol, but insoluble in water.<br>
Fifty grams of Ethoquad C/12-75DK (Akzo Nobel) was placed in a round-bottom flask on a rotary evaporator and evaporated to dryness. The residue (--37,5 grams) was redissolved in 70 mL tetrahydrofuran (THF) with agitation at approximately 50,C. Forty grams of toIylene-2,4-diisocyanate (TDI) was added and the solution was mixed for one hour while immersed in a water bath held at ---SO,C, The viscosity of the solution increased during this time, and the solution remained clear when cooled to room temperature. The solution was stored overnight at room temperature and some additional increase in viscosity was observed* Nine grams of dipropylene glycol was added, and the solution was mixed for four hours at 50°C. The mixture was then placed on a rotary evaporator to remove all volatile solvent (primarily THF) by vacuum stripping at ~50°C. The mixture was then dissolved in 100 mL of isopropanol, and the vacuum stripping was repeated. The mixture was then dissolved in 100 mL of isopropanol once again, and the vacuum stripping was again repeated. The mixture was then redissolved in 100 mL of isopropanol to give a clear, viscous, yellowish solution with a solid<br><br>
polymer content of-56 wt%. The polymer solution was subsequently diluted to various concentrations ranging from 1% to 10% solids, and these solutions were used to coat various objects such as glass slides and polypropylene test-tubes. The coatings were clear to slightly opaque when dry, were non-tacky, and were adherent to the substrate. Furthermore, the coatings were not removed by rinsing in water or saline solution. The product polymer is believed to comprise a linear polyurethane with quaternary ammonium units in the main-chain structure of the polymer. The product of this example was coded as "H3-C", and is used as an antimicrobial coating in some of the following examples.<br>
EXAMPLE A7: Synthesis of a quaternary ammonium polyurethane (H3-F) containing covalently-bonded fluorescein moieties, which is soluble in alcohol, but insoluble in water.<br>
Fifty milligrams of fluorescein dye (neutral molecule) was dissolved in 3 mL of THF, and then mixed with eight grams of tolylene-2,4-diisocyanate (TDI). This solution was mixed for one hour at -50°C, and then stored overnight at room temperature before being mixed with ten grams of Ethoquad C/12-75DK (Akzo Nobel), which had previously been vacuum stripped to remove the isopropanol solvent and redissolved in 14 grams tetrahydrofuran (THF) with agitation at approximately 50°C. This mixture was then mixed for several hours at '-SO,,C, and then subjected to vacuum stripping. The mixture was redissolved in isopropanol and then vacuum stripped. The dissolution/stripping was repeated one additional time, and the product was dissolved in -50 mL isopropanol. The solution was found to have a solids content of 17.4 wt%. The product of this reaction is expected to be fluorescein-labeled linear polyurethane containing quaternary ammonium moieties in the polymer main-chain structure. Additionally, the polymer is expected to contain fluorescein moieties in the polymer main-chain structure. The fluorescein moieties provide a useful diagnostic tool to measure the presence, dispersion, persistence, and migration of the polymer. Coatings were prepared on various substrates as described in the preceding example, and the<br><br>
coatings had similar properties to those described above* Coated glass microscope slides were placed into 50 mL culture tubes containing either 15 mL of deionized water or 15 mL of phosphate buffered saline and place in a shaking incubator for several hours at 37**C. The solutions were then analyzed by visible spectroscopy (Spectronic 20) at 495 nm. No leaching of fluorescein could be detected, indicating complete incorporation of the dye into the polymer structure.<br>
EXAMPLE A8: Preparation of an antimicrobial coating composition*<br>
Appropriate amounts of the quaternary polyurethane described above (H3-C) and glycerol were diluted in isopropanol to give a composition that contained 10 wt% H3-C and 5 wt% glycerol. The solution remained clear, and the film forming and adherent properties of the polymer were not adversely affected when coatings were prepared on glass slides.<br>
EXAMPLE A9: Preparation of an antimicrobial coating composition containing a skin emollient (SS-IC).<br>
Appropriate amounts of the quaternary polyurethane described above (H3-C) and glycerol were diluted in isopropanol in order to give a final composition that contained 10 wt% H3-C, 5 wt% propylene glycol, and 5% dipropylene glycol, with the balance being isopropanol (80 wt%). The solution remained clear, and the film forming and adherent properties, as well as the antimicrobial efficacy of the polymer were not adversely affected when coatings were prepared on glass slides or pig skin. Propylene glycol and dipropylene glycol are known to have emollient properties and are widely used in topical skin products such as lotions and cosmetics.<br>
EXAMPLE AID: Preparation of an antimicrobial coating composition containing a skin emollient<br><br>
The formulation of Example A9 (SS-IC) was diluted with isopropanol at ratios of one part SS-IC to one part isopropanol, and one part SS-IC to three parts isopropanol.<br>
EXAMPLE All: Preparation of an antimicrobial coating composition containing a skin emollient and UV absorber.<br>
The formulation of EXAMPLE A9 (SS-IC) is modified to include UV-absorbing or U V-blocking sunscreen ingredient in order to protect the skin from absorption of UV rays and to prevent sunburn. The UV-absorbing or UV-blocking additive is selected from the list comprising: para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA), PABA esters, cinnamates, benzophenes, salicylates, octocrylene, dibenzoyl-methane, avobenzone, oxybenzone, zinc oxide, and titanium dioxide.<br>
EXAMPLE A12: Preparation of an antimicrobial coating composition containing a skin emollient and Vitamin E.<br>
The formulation of Example A9 (SS-IC) is modified to include 1% vitamin E. Vitamin E is practically insoluble in water, but freely soluble in alcohol. EXAMPLE A13: Preparation of an antimicrobial coating composition containing an antimicrobial additive (SS1C-BAC3).<br>
An antimicrobial coating composition (SS1C-BAC3) is prepared by mixing 1.1 grams of benzalkonium chloride with 35.5 grams of the formulation of Example A9 (SS-IC). The benzalkonium chloride fully dissolved and the solution was clear and colorless. This composition was tested for antimicrobial efficacy using a modified version of ASTM test method #E 1874-97 ('Standard Test Method for Evaluation of Antibacterial Washes by Cup Scrub Technique "), as described below. Variations included using harvested pig skin from a slaughterhouse rather than live human volunteers. In addition to the SS1C-BAC3 material, a placebo<br><br>
was formulated which consisted of 5% propylene glycol and 5% dipropylene glycol in isopropanol. Results are presented below.<br>
Summary and Results of Modified Cup Scrub Technique for Fig Skin<br>
1.	Preparation and Sterilization of Pig Skin Samples<br>
1.1	Nine total samples were used in this method - 3 samples for test product (SS1C-BAC3), 3 for placebo, and 3 for negative controls* The samples were cut out of a sheet of pig skin by tracing the bottom of a Petri dish onto the skin and cutting out the circular piece, so that the samples were an appropriate size to completely line the bottom of the Petri dish. Each of the 9 samples were cut from the sheet of skin and placed into the bottom of its own Petri dish, stratum corneum side up.<br>
1.2	Once in the Petri dishes, the sample skins were wiped with a towel that was thoroughly saturated with 70% alcohol, and then placed under UV light in the BSC (biological safety cabinet) to dry for approx 10 minutes. The lids of the Petri dishes were also placed (facing up) along side of the samples under the UV light.<br>
2.	Application of Test Product and Placebo<br>
2.1	After drying under UV light, the BSC was switched to fluorescence with the blower on, and a 1x1 in square was drawn on to each of the skins with an ink marker. This is used as the site of application. The UV light was turned on again, with the lids still facing up, for a few minutes to insure that no contamination occurred while marking the skins.<br>
2.2	The BSC was switched back to fluorescence with the blower on, and the lids were placed back onto the Petri dishes containing the samples*<br><br>
2.3	One sample at a time, the lid was lifted from the Petri dish and 0.5 mL each of the test product was applied to the first three samples (within the designated square). The sterile pipette tip was changed in between each application.<br>
2.4	Step 2.2 is repeated 3 times with the placebo, and the remaining 3 sample skins are left as negative controls.<br>
3,	Performance of Cup Scrub Technique<br>
3.1	Once the product and placebo was applied each of the 9 samples were left covered in the BSC, and one sample was brought out at a time for tesfing.<br>
3.2	The cup (about 1.5 cm diameter and 1.5 in tall) was centered onto the application site of the sample with firm pressure to form a cup/skin seal. The cup was first sterilized In 95% alcohol and then flame dried. While one person maintained constant pressure on the cup to protect the cup/skin seal, another person dispensed ,25 mL of inoculum into the cup. Once dispensed, the inoculum was left for a 5 minute exposure.<br>
3.3	After 5 minutes, a glass rod that had been sterilized in 95% alcohol and flame dried was used to scrub around the skin within the cup for 30 seconds. After the 30 seconds the fluid was recovered with a sterile pipette into 0,5 mL ofneutralizer.<br>
3.4	Once the sample fluid was recovered, 0.25 mL ofneutralizer was dispensed onto the same test site for a second recovery, and another 30 sec scrub was performed with a newly fired glass rod. The fluid was recovered into the same solution from the first scrub.<br>
3.5	Steps 3.2-3.4 are repeated for the remaining 8 samples.<br>
4.	Data Collection<br><br>
Results were quantified by making standard serial dilutions of the recovered scrub fluids and then plated using the spread plate technique. Plates were incubated over night and log reductions were calculated for both the negative control and the placebo<br>
5* Results<br>
In tests of the product vs E. coli, two consecutive performances showed full kill, which corresponded to an average 4.5 log reduction in this instance.<br>
The placebo showed no effect on the test organism.<br>
Thin Film Efficacy Test fTFET):<br>
Summary: The Thin Film Efficacy Test (TFET) was developed, based on [Bhende, S; Rothenburger, S; Spangler, DJ; In Vitro Assessment of Microbial Barrier Properties of Dermabond Topical Skin Adhesive. Surgical Infections 3(3), pp 251-257 (2002)] to determine the bacteriostatic ability of an antibacterial solution* The procedural steps of the TFET consist of applying an antibacterial solution to appropriate growth media plates and allowing the solution to completely dry. The plates are then inoculated with -1 xlO", CFU/ml of desired organism and subsequently incubated overnight after inoculum has completely absorbed. The area of application is then checked for bacteriostatic activity.<br>
Plates:	The media plates used for this assay are selective media plates that<br>
are appropriate to the respective organisms. Sixty plates are used for each organism.<br>
MSA:   MSA (Mannitol Salt Agar) is the selective media for S,<br>
aureus and MRSA, EMB: Eosin Methylene Blue Agar is the selective media for E. coli, EA:     Enterococcosel Agar is the selective media for VRE,<br><br>
Coating:<br><br>
100 |xl of the antibacterial solution is applied to each plate and allowed to air dry for a minimum of 1 hour in the biological safety cabinet before inoculating.<br><br>
Inoculating:    The test organism is grown in the appropriate growth media and incubated overnight unless otherwise specified. The inoculum is made to achieve a titer of 10, CFU/ml The coated plates are then inoculated with 1000 \i\ bacterial solution and the inoculum is then homogenously applied by moving the plate in a circular motion.<br>
Exposure:      The samples are incubated at 37,C in a high humidity chamber and the exposure time is overnight unless otherwise stated.<br>
Results:	After incubation, each plate is inspected for bacteriostatic activity<br>
on the area of application. The results are read as Pass/Fail. If there is no growth, the plate is read as Pass and if there is growth on the area, the plate is read as Fail.<br>
TFET - Results:<br>
EXAMPLE Tl<br>
The Thin Film Efficacy Test (TFET) was used to determine the bacteriostatic ability of the antimicrobial solution. The procedural steps of the TFET consist of using growth media plates as carriers in which 100 \i\ of the chosen antimicrobial solution is applied in the center of the plate. The antimicrobial solution was allowed to air dry for a minimum of 1 hour prior to inoculation. The coated plates were inoculated with 1000 |xl inoculum at a titer of 10, CFU/ml. The inoculum was homogeneously applied by swirling the plate until the inoculum completely covered the entire surface area of the plate. The inoculated plates were then allowed to dry and subsequently incubated overnight at 37,C. Following<br><br>
overnight incubation, the area of antimicrobial solution application was checked for suppression of bacterial growth and the results were read as Pass/Fail. If suppression of growth was observed, the plate was considered passing. If no suppression of growth as observed, the plate was considered failing* The media used for S. aureus, ATCC #6538, was Mannitol Salt Agar (MSA) and the antimicrobial solution used was H3-C (From Example A6).<br>

Carrier Persistence Test rCPT):<br>
Summary: This procedure is a modification of the EPA's Standard Operating Procedure: Testing of Spray Disinfectants against Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Mycobacterium boviswhich is an adaptation of the AOAC method to determine the efficacy of spray products as hard surface disinfectants against three test organisms, Mycobacterium bovis (BCG), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus aureus.<br>
The procedural steps of the CPT consist of applying an antimicrobial test solution to chosen carriers and allowing the carriers to dry before they are inoculated with the appropriate test organism. After inoculation, the carriers are incubated for the prescribed exposure time, subsequently placed into neutralizing solution, then serial diluted and plated for efficacy quantification using standard methods.<br>
Carriers:        The carriers are 25 cm and can be comprised of a variety of<br>
materials. The carriers are sterilized by methods appropriate to the carrier's composition. The three carriers types used in these assays are borosilicate glass, Vitro-Skin, and pig skin; however, carriers suitable for use in this method are not limited to the aforementioned.<br><br>
Borosilicate Glass:<br><br>
Borosilicate glass slides are washed with ethanol and allowed to air dry. After drying, the borosilicate glass slides are placed into Petri dishes and autoclaved for 15 minutes.<br><br><br><br>
Vitro-Skin:<br><br>
The Vitro-Skin is prepared according to manufacturer's specifications* If Vitro-Skin becomes unsterile, it needs to be sterilized with 70% alcohol, allowed to dry, and re-hydrated according to the manufacturer's specifications. Vitro-Skin was directly purchased from the manufacturer (IMS Inc., Orange, CT). VITRO-SKIN is an advanced testing substrate that effectively mimics the surface properties of human skin. It contains both optimized protein and lipid components and is designed to have topography, pH, critical surface tension and ionic strength similar to human skin.<br><br>
Pig Skin:        The pig skin is sterilized with 70% alcohol* This procedure<br>
includes thoroughly wetting the carriers with the 70% alcohol and allowing the carriers to thoroughly air dry in a Biological Safety Cabinet (BSC). As an alternative, the pig skin may be exposed to UV light for 10 minutes. Fresh pig skin is purchased from a local slaughterhouse.<br>
Application:   The antimicrobial solution is applied to each carrier until it thoroughly wets the carriers. The solution volume should not exceed 1000 jil and will not be less than 20 |il. The antimicrobial solution is then allowed to air dry for a minimum of 1 hour in a BSC before inoculating.<br>
Inoculation:    Test organisms are grown in appropriate growth media and incubated overnight at 37,C unless otherwise specified. The<br><br>
inoculum is modified to produce a titer of 10 CFU/ml. The carriers carrying the antimicrobial solution is then inoculated with 10 fxl-20 \i\ of inoculum. The inoculum will be distributed with sterile swabs saturated with inoculum. Exposure time begins directly after inoculation.<br>
Exposure:       The exposure time is overnight unless otherwise specified and samples are incubated at 37°C in a high humidity chamber.<br>
Neutralization: Inoculated carriers are neutralized before recovering the<br>
organisms to stop antimicrobial activity of the antimicrobial solution. All neutralizations are done with 20 ml aliquots of Letheen Broth in 50 ml conical centrifuge tubes at a minimum of 10 minutes unless otherwise specified.<br>
Recovery:       Organism recovery is started within the neutralization tubes. The<br>
neutralized carriers are vortexed for 1 minute and the organisms are subsequently recovered with standard serial dilution and plating methods. Plates are incubated overnight at 37°C and colony forming units are quantified the following day.<br>
Controls:        Carrier substrates without any applied antimicrobial coating are used as negative controls to determine the baseline microbial growth. Control substrates were of the same composition as the test substrates within each sample set. Colony counts for the control substrates are reported.<br>
Calculations: Calculations will be computed using a Microsoft Excel<br>
spreadsheet. Electronic copies of the spreadsheet as well as hard copies will be retained.<br><br>
To calculate CFU/mL per carrier:<br>
-w	-X	-y<br>
[(avg. CFU for 10  ) +(avg. CFU for 10 )+ (avg. CFU for 10 )+ (avg. CPU for<br>
-z	-w	-X	-y	-z<br>
10 )]/(10  +10 +10 + 10 )<br>
-w        -X        -y	-z<br>
where 10  ,10 ,10 , and 10  are the dilutions plated. In the event that one or more dilutions yield plate counts greater than 300, or less than 30, those counts and their corresponding dilutions will not be used in the calculations. In the event that only one of two plates has counts yielding 300 CFU or less, that plate count and its corresponding dilution will be included but no average will be determined*<br>
NOTE: Plate counts of 0 are to be included in all calculations.<br>
To calculate Log Reduction:<br>
LR = Log[(CFU/ml for treated carrier)/(CFU/ml for control carrier)]<br>
