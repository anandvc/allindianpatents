				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention gerally relates to a shut off device in a fuel firing system of<br>
boiler. More particularly, the invention relates to an integrated shut off device for<br>
isolating the fuel supply system of a boiler. <br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Fuel is fired to the combustion unit (Boiler furnace) using air as the transporting<br>
medium. In a fuel firing system, pulverized fuel from the pulverizers are carried<br>
to the burners by air through a plurality of parallel lines of pipes. The air, which<br>
carries the fuel to the burner is called primary air" and supplied to the furnace<br>
along with the fuel. A secondary air" is supplied to the boiler through a<br>
compartmentalized secondary air duct. The supplied air is distributed and<br>
regulated by a number of secondary air dampers actuated by equivalent number<br>
of air cylinders. The fuel compartments are sandwiched one over the other with<br>
the air compartments disposed in between. The burner tips are tilted upward and<br>
-downward by means of atleast one tilt link. Hence, a pulverized fuel firing<br>
system, in particular, a corner fuel firing system consists of damper drives, tilt<br>
drives and monitoring means, in addition to the burner components. Hence the<br>
fuel firing system need continuous monitoring.<br>
Based on the monitoring results, firing of fuel to the boiler is to be intermittently<br>
cut oft during the operations. Hence, a periodical shut off of the fuel firing<br>
system requires isolation of the burners from the fuel supply lines of the system.<br>
According to the existing art, slide valve devices are employed to act as the shut<br>
off device. This device occupies a space which is almost twice that of the pipe<br>
diameter and twice the height of the drive. Thus, the slide valve device takes<br>
away the major portion of the maintenance space provided for the burners<br>
including the approach area leading to difficulty in operational monitoring and<br>
approachability during maintenance of the system. The size of the valve device<br>
also interferes with the damper drive means of the burner assembly.<br>
US patent No. 5020776 dated 04.06.1991 tilted "split seat gate valve"by Owens,<br>
et al. discloses a gate valve assembly, which has two aligned and connected<br>
body housing members which each has a gate slot above a through-passage<br>
which is disposed above a seat portion of the gate slot.<br>
In this new art, the gate is an integral part of a fuel inlet elbow and the turning<br>
movement of the drive shaft helps in closing and opening of the gate valve<br>
assembly.<br>
US patent No. 6,260,490 dated 17.09.2001 titled "Burner isolation valve for<br>
pulverized fuel systems" by wark, et al. discloses an isolation gate which includes<br>
a valve plate assembly and a sealing mechanism for the valve plate assembly.<br>
In this new art, the shaft bearings are sealed externally along with succeeding<br>
groove rings, which ensures tight sealing. The actuating mechanism operates a<br>
shaft with a disc for closing and opening of the port.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to propose an integrated-shut<br>
off device which does not require additional space.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to propose an integrated shut off<br>
device which provides sufficient and easy approachability for maintenance of the<br>
inner components of the burner. <br>
A still another object of the present invention is to propose an integrated shut off<br>
device which provides easy access to the burner area.<br>
A further object of the present invention is to propose an integrated shut off<br>
device which can withstand the abrasive flow of coal gas mixture.<br><br>
A still further object of the present invention is to propose an integrated shut off<br>
device which requires less assembly time.<br>
An yet further object the present invention is to propose an integrated shut off<br>
device which requires application of optimum drive force.<br>
An yet another object of the present invention is to propose an integrated shut<br>
off device which is simple, easy to operate and less costly.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Accordingly, there is provided an integrated shut off device which basically<br>
comprises an elbow gate for fuel inlet configured as an integrated structure of<br>
the burner bend.<br>
The gate body is an elbow body with ceramic lining having provision for<br>
maintenance including space for accommodating a disc. A drive shaft is actuated<br>
by a drive lever, which is connected to an actuator shaft by means of a plurality<br>
of connectors and securing means. The turning motion is transferred to the disc<br>
by a disc plate, which is locked to the drive shaft by means of atleast one spring<br>
dowel. The shaft is supported at both ends on atleast two shaft bearings. The<br>
shaft bearings are sealed externally. The disc is pressed on a valve seat<br>
against the fuel air mixture flow by the drive shaft. The drive force associated<br>
with the disc is sufficiently high to provide a tight sealing. The body and the disc<br>
facing the fuel air flow is completely insulated with ceramic materials. The shaft<br>
bearings are sealed externally along with each succeeding groove rings for tight<br>
sealing. The device is provided with a maintenance door, which provides access<br>
to the inner component. The disc is actuated by means of an actuator or by a<br>
hand lever. The shaft is turned by means of an actuator lever connected to the<br>
actuator. The actuators are actuated by means of a solenoid valve having speed<br>
regulator.<br>
The gate body constitutes an welded steel structurd and completely ceramic<br>
lined to withstand the abrasive action of fuel flow. The seat of the valve device is<br>
made of wear resistant high grade steel.<br>
In the closed position, the valve is pressed onto the valve seat against the coal <br>
air mixture flow by the drive shaft. The drive force associated with the disc load<br>
is sufficiently high to provide a tight seal. <br>
When the gate is opened, the turning motion of the drive shaft and the<br>
additional support of the delivery pressure causes the disc to open to 60 degree,<br>
thus providing a free flow.<br>

Further objects, features and advantages will be apparent from the following<br>
detailed description when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.<br>
