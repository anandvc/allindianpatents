FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to an improved process for the preparation of sumatriptan. Sumatriptan which is 3-(2-dimethylamino)ethyl-N-methyl-1 H-indole-5-methane-sulfonamide has the formula-I given below.<br><br>
Sumatriptan and its pharmaceutically acceptable salts are widely used as antimigraine agents and also for cluster headaches.<br>
BACKGROUND OF INVENTION<br>
Sumatriptan is reported for the first time by Glaxo in GB patent no 2162522 (corresponding to the US patent no 5037845 (1989)). It is found to be serotonin 5HTi-receptor agonist. Its clinical evaluation in migraine is described in Lancet, 1, 1309 (1988) and its studies on cluster headache are revealed in Engl. J. Med. 325, 322 (1991). Sumatriptan succinate is available in the market as Imigran or Imitrex.<br>
Process for the preparation of sumatriptan described in the GB patent no 2162522 is based on a Fischer indole synthesis. Accordingly, the compound of the formula-II is reacted with compound of the formula-Ill to get the corresponding hydrazone of the formula-IV which on cyclization using ethyl polyphosphate ester gave sumatriptan of the formula-I. This reaction sequence is shown in Scheme-I.<br><br><br>
The indolyzation reaction was done by mixing 4 g of the hydrazone of formula-IV with 20 g polyphosphate ester in 80 ml chloroform medium at room temperature for 4 h. The crude sumatriptan (2.5 g) thus obtained after water work up was subjected to column chromatography to yield an oil (1.13 g) which on salt formation with succinic acid gave the corresponding hemi-succinate salt (0.83 g, overall yield is 14.8%).<br>
The process does not mention about the mode of addition of reactants (hydrazone intermediate of formula-IV and polyphosphate ester) and the temperature during the mixing of reactants. During the process development for sumatriptan on a commercial scale we found that the Fischer indolization process shown in Scheme-I is highly scale dependent and yield dropped considerably with increasing the batch size.<br>
Under the conditions employed in the above reported process on a typically 1 kg scale, yield of sumatriptan was less than 5%. The main impurities formed during the process are dimeric compounds of the formulae-V and VI and also some polymeric material. We also observed that mixing of reactants is very exothermic and the yield of sumatriptan during indolization is also temperature dependant, rate of addition of reactant dependant, and reaction maintenance time dependant. With increasing temperature and maintenance time formation of impurities increased drastically.<br><br><br>
Sumatriptan has become a well-known anti-migraine drug that has now been on the market and has shown great promise as a valuable anti-migraine drug with few side effects. Keeping in view of the difficulties in commercialization of the above-mentioned process for the preparation of sumatriptan, we aimed to develop a simple and economical process for commercial production of sumatriptan based on the process given in GB 2162522.<br>
We observed that a promising approach for increasing/maintaining the yield and quality of sumatriptan (purity of at least 99%) during the scale up operations would be to (a) optimize the reaction temperature during the mixing of reactants, (b) optimize the amount of polyphosphate ester to suit the scale up operations, (c) fix the mode of addition of reactants (whether to add polyphosphate ester to the hydrazone intermediate or the intermediate to the polyphosphate ester, (d) optimize the rate of addition of polyphosphate ester to the hydrazone derivative, (e) optimize the maintenance time of reaction, and (f) avoid the usage of column chromatography.<br>
Accordingly, the main objective of the present invention is to provide an improved process for the preparation of sumatriptan of the formula-I which is commercially applicable.<br>
Another objective of the present invention is to provide an improved process for the preparation of sumatriptan of the formula-I of purity of at least 99% avoiding the formation of impurities.<br><br>
Still another objective of the present invention is to provide an improved process for the preparation of sumatriptan with high yield (&gt;30%) and high purity (&gt;99%).<br>
Yet another objective of the present invention is to provide an improved process for the preparation of sumatriptan of the formula-I, which is simple avoiding column chromatography techniques thereby making the process economical.<br>
Still another objective of the present invention is to provide an improved process for the preparation of solid crystalline sumatriptan of the formula-I which is directly obtained from the reaction mass by simple crystallization techniques.<br>
The present invention has been developed based on our finding that the above Fischer indolization process is very sensitive to (i) temperature, (ii) the amount of polyphosphate ester used, (iii) rate of addition of polyphosphate ester and (iv) maintenance time of reaction. We also found that the optimization of these process parameters will result in the better yield and quality of sumatriptan formed. Also, the crude sumatriptan prepared under the above mentioned modified conditions can be easily crystallized from a number of solvents without requiring any column chromatography techniques.<br>
During the studies on above Fischer indolization process for making sumatriptan on a commercial scale we observed that the mode of addition of reactants is very important. Addition of polyphosphate ester to the hydrazone intermediate of formula-IV gives better yield and quality of product than the vice versa. During the Fischer indolization process addition of polyphosphate ester to the compound of the formula-IV is exothermic and controlling the temperature below 15 °C is very essential. To overcome the exothermic problem during scale up operations, cooling the reaction mass to below 5°C is also found to be very critical before the addition of polyphosphate ester. The rate of addition of polyphosphate ester to the compound of the formula-IV should be preferably within the period of 5-30 min, more preferably during the period of 10-15min. The maintenance temperature of the reaction mass should be preferably in the range of 15-30°C, more preferably in the range of 20-25 °C. The maintenance time of reaction mass is preferably<br><br>
in the range of 2-4 h, more preferably in the range of 2.5-3.0 h. The amount of ethyl polyphosphate ester used in the reaction is preferably in the range of 4-8 times the weight of the compound of the formula-IV, more preferably in the range of 5-6 times. The reaction can be monitored by HPLC and the optimum percentage of sumatriptan produced was found to be in the range of 60-75%.<br>
Modification of the process in the above suggested manner avoided the usage of costly column chromatography techniques and also resulting in the increase in yield of sumatriptan and tolerability of the process in scale up operations for industrial applications. These features of the improved process constitute the novelty of the present invention.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides an improved process for the preparation of high purity (at least 99 %) sumatripan of the formula-I,<br><br>
to a temperature in the range of 0-10 °C (ii)      Adding polyphosphate ester to the cooled solution of the compound of the<br>
