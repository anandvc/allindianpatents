Reduction gearing for an electric actuator<br>
The invention relates to a reduction gearing of an electrically operated actuator to<br>
control a gaseous or liquid volume flow, in particular in the field of heating,<br>
ventilation and air conditioning, fire or smoke protection.<br>
Electric actuator drives for motorising actuators in heating, ventilation and air<br>
conditioning systems (HLK) have been produced for more than 30 years. HLK<br>
actuators guarantee an economic volume flow control of gas or liquid, in particular<br>
air and water. As a compact unit they comprise not only the drive but also<br>
pressure sensors and regulators combined in one unit.<br>
Ventilation systems are used increasingly in buildings, in particular residential,<br>
office, commercial and industrial buildings, normally combined with fire and smoke<br>
protection devices. In ventilation systems, volume flow control with swivellable air<br>
flaps plays an essential role. The volume flow is measured with a suitable<br>
measuring instrument such as for example the NMV-D2M by Belimo Automation<br>
AG, CH-8340 Hinwil, that is formed as a compact unit of drive, pressure sensor<br>
and regulator, and passes measurement values to an electronics unit.<br>
In modern building systems, as well as AC devices, DC devices are increasingly<br>
used. A DC 24V power supply can be used directly, no separate power supply<br>
with transformer being required.<br>
To move a flap in a ventilation system or a tap in a water pipe system, relatively<br>
weak motors must activate large surface or large volume control elements.<br>
Precise and stable adjustment is possible only with very great reduction gearing.<br>
To swivel a flap or turn a tap through an acute or right angle, numerous rotations<br>
of the electric motor shaft are required. The electronics process the control signals<br>
and control the electric motor.<br><br>
CH 614507 A5 describes an actuator drive with an electric motor and gearing for<br>
the ventilation system. The drive unit can be pushed onto a flap or valve shaft.<br>
The last toothed gear element is formed as a tooth segment and fitted with a<br>
hollow shaft that is mounted radially rotatable but axially fixed in a base plate of<br>
the actuator drive. The electric motor can remain connected after reaching the<br>
end stops which restrict the rotation angle of the tooth segment. The actuator<br>
drive described is used in air flaps, mixer taps and throttle valves in heating and<br>
ventilation systems. The reduction gearing system described is appliance-specific.<br>
The invention is based on the object of creating a reduction gearing of the type<br>
cited initially which is versatile in use, offers low production and storage costs, but<br>
achieves the same output for approximately the same operating costs.<br>
The object is achieved according to the invention in that a modularly constructed<br>
reduction gearing comprises a primary gearing with at least one drive motor and a<br>
secondary gearing with an output drive, wherein a self-lock is integrated, and the<br>
gear modules are connected together detachably. Special and further<br>
embodiments of the invention are the object of dependent claims.<br>
The ability of modular primary and secondary gearings to be combined in an<br>
arbitrary fashion, following the rules of combination systems, allows the following<br>
number K of combinations:<br><br>
Thus for example with 6 primary gearings and 6 secondary gearings, 36<br>
combinations of reduction gearings for electric actuators are possible; with 3<br>
primary gearings and 10 secondary gearings, 30 combinations.<br><br>
Self-locking in the present sense occurs when a control element i.e. a flap, a<br>
valve, in particular a tap or a lift valve, has reached the end position and the<br>
electric motor has switched off. In this situation the gearing must remain position-<br>
stable and may not move if the gas or liquid volume flow changes. This situation<br>
corresponds to that of a self-locking screw.<br>
The self-lock between the primary and secondary gearing may be a non-<br>
switchable or a switchable coupling.<br>
The self-lock is preferably formed as a torque-limiting coupling, in particular a<br>
friction coupling or a brake coupling. In the rest position, the axially resilient self-<br>
lock is compressed according to the friction force to be generated, the rotationally<br>
stiff self-lock in contrast is relaxed in relation to a torque. On connection of the<br>
drive motor the rotationally stiff self-lock is tensioned, even after turning through<br>
an angle of a few degrees the self-lock begins to slip at the point of least<br>
resistance until the drive motor is switched off, then immediately a block is applied<br>
by the self-lock. Instead of a mechanical friction coupling any other coupling with<br>
the same effect can be formed, in particular a corresponding magnetic coupling.<br>
The expression "slip" is used for the sake of simplicity also for a magnetic<br>
coupling.<br>
In a second variant the self-lock can have a friction surface on both sides in<br>
relation to the axial direction. Suitably, the resistance to a torque is not equally<br>
large but different. This is achieved by different sized friction radii of the rotation<br>
axes of the gear wheels concerned. By application of the lever law, it can be<br>
concluded that with the same friction coefficient and the same pressure, the<br>
friction surface with the smaller radius r begins to slip before the friction surface<br>
with the larger radius R. The same applies, as already indicated, for a magnetic<br>
coupling.<br>
In practice the larger friction radius R is normally allocated to the primary gearing<br>
and the smaller friction radius r to a housing part. Without further measures the<br>
self-lock on the housing part begins to slip.<br><br>
In a further variant of the invention the self-lock is formed as an externally<br>
activated switchable coupling. To this end, in the area of the small friction radius r,<br>
bolts or cams can be inserted to block the self-lock. Now the self-lock begins to<br>
slip in the area of the larger radius R when the drive motor of the primary gearing<br>
is engaged. This switch takes place when a larger resistance is necessary.<br>
According to a further embodiment, the first free-running gear wheel with the<br>
primary gearing can be firmly connected with the self-lock and a housing part in<br>
the area of a small and a large friction radius can have contact surfaces for the<br>
self-lock but at a different level. The one friction surface is on an axially<br>
displaceable lifting bolt, the other friction surface is arranged concentric and<br>
annular. Using the lifting bolt e.g. a spring plate can be raised from the outer<br>
annular friction surface and now lies on the bolt itself. Because of the different<br>
friction radii R, r, the self-lock becomes substantially smaller.<br>
The self-lock preferably comprises a rotationally stiff locking spring that can be<br>
tensioned in the axial direction of the gear wheels and is preferably formed as a<br>
conical compression spring, a coil spring or leaf spring. The different friction radii<br>
R, r are achieved by different length spring legs.<br>
The self-lock i.e. the friction resistance can be increased by increasing the<br>
pressure in the axial direction. The pressure is increased equally for both radii R, r<br>
but because of the different radius or lever arm length, has a different effect.<br>
Suitably the primary and secondary gearings can be decoupled so that each can<br>
rotate freely. This is achieved suitably by decoupling a gear wheel lying on the<br>
self-lock, preferably by pressing a release button.<br>
For a position feedback for example a potentiometer can be used which<br>
decouples the last gear wheel in the direction of the output. To activate the<br>
primary and hence the secondary gearing, a drive motor of known type is used, in<br><br><br>
particular a DC motor, a brushless DC motor, a sensorless DC motor or a synchronous<br>
motor have proved suitable in practice.<br>
With a view to operating safety, an energy accumulator can be integrated so that on a<br>
motor defect the actuator can nonetheless be activated. Preferably, the energy<br>
accumulator which is arranged in the primary gearing is a mechanical spring, a battery<br>
or a condenser.<br>
The secondary gearing, also by way of known means, is connected with a drive shaft of<br>
a flap, a tap or a linear motor for a lift valve, in particular a plug valve, suitably by<br>
means of a coupling module.<br>
The advantages of the present invention can be summarized briefly as follows:<br>
-	Due to the modular structure of the reduction gearing comprising primary<br>
"gearing, secondary gearing and self-lock, a high device flexibility can be achieved<br>
with a low number of components.<br>
-	Also the further constituents of the actuator can be formed modular, in particular<br>
the sensor and COM module, the electronics and the housing, whereby the<br>
advantages of a high device flexibility with a low number of assemblies is further<br>
enhanced.<br>
-	The high device flexibility also has a positive effect for covering different<br>
applications.<br>
-	The primary unit can be adapted to the electronic platform (size, motor<br>
technology).<br>
All advantages of the electric actuators refined to a high level are retained.<br>

The reduction gearing 10 shown in fig. 1 comprises substantially a primary<br>
gearing 12 and a secondary gearing 14 which are formed modular and connected<br>
detachably together. Between a first freely rotating spur gear F and a housing part<br>
60 (fig. 2) is arranged a self-lock 16 which in the present case comprises a<br>
rotationally stiff locking spring 18 of spring steel.<br>
A relatively low power drive motor 20, in the present case a DC motor which rests<br>
on a support 22, by way of a motor shaft 24 drives a longitudinal gear wheel E<br>
known as the E-wheel for short. This is engaged with a narrow spur gear of large<br>
diameter which is connected with or formed as one piece with a gear wheel of<br>
small diameter or a pinion (F-wheel). Finally a further gear wheel, the D-wheel, is<br>
allocated to the primary gearing 12.<br>
A further reduction spur gear, the C-wheel coaxial with the F-wheel, is allocated to<br>
the secondary gearing 14, the common longitudinal axis U is also the common<br>
longitudinal axis of the locking spring 18. A last axially symmetrical reduction spur<br>
gear - the B wheel - drives a segment which is also known as the A-wheel.<br>
All gear wheels A to E have parallel axes Lt, L2, and are constructed in the normal<br>
manner e.g. spur gears, worm gears, herringbone gears with normal toothing<br>
geometry, they comprise a metal and/or an abrasion-resistant plastic of high<br>
mechanical strength. Due to the high reduction ratio, a relatively weak electrical<br>
drive motor 20 is sufficiently strong. The swivel angle in the one or the other<br>
direction indicated with double arrow 26 can be set precisely. The maximum<br>
swivel angle is in practice 90°, in relation to the longitudinal axis L2 the swivel<br>
range is in particular between 30 and 90°.<br><br>
The A-wheel is connected by way of a coupling module 28 with force and/or<br>
interference fit with a hollow shaft 30 which activates a flap, a ball valve or a linear<br>
motor. The longitudinal axis L2 runs parallel to the longitudinal axis L1. The hollow<br>
shaft 30 is mounted swivellably by way of an upper and a lower bearing 32, 34 in<br>
a housing 58, 60 indicated in fig. 2 of a modularly constructed actuator and<br>
marked as output 36.<br>
For the design of the actuators reference is made for example to the company<br>
brochure NEWS VAV NMV-D2M by Belimo Automation AG, CH-8340 Hinwil.<br>
Arranged in the housing 60 of the primary gearing 12 is an also modular electronic<br>
unit 38 which for example issues the necessary control commands to the drive<br>
motor 20 and the energy accumulator 40 for emergency operation. These<br>
commands can also be input by way of a manually activatable control element 42.<br>
On the housing 58, 60 of the primary gearing 12 already mentioned is also<br>
attached an electrical connection 44 which in particular supplies the motor 20 and<br>
the energy accumulator 40. The modular construction also allows the driving of<br>
several secondary gearings 14 with the same primary gearing 12.<br>
By way of a spur gear 48 which engages in the pinion of the gear wheel B, the<br>
rotational movement is transmitted by way of a shaft 50 to a potentiometer 52 for<br>
the position feedback to the electronics 38.<br>
Finally, a manually activatable release button 54 is formed which can be pressed<br>
down manually. This pushes the F-wheel down along axis L1, which is possible<br>
thanks to the locking spring 18, until the pinion of the F-wheel disengages from<br>
the D-wheel. This allows free-running for the primary gearing 12 and the<br>
secondary gearing 14 without dismantling the modules. The fact that the spur<br>
gear 48 of the potentiometer 52 is also turned when the secondary gearing 14 is<br>
activated in free running is insignificant due to the low resistance. Evidently, the<br>
actuator pin 56 of the release button 54 runs outside the D-wheel.<br><br>
Of essential significance for the invention is the modular structure of the reduction<br>
gearing 10 comprising the primary gearing 12 and secondary gearing 14, but also<br>
the inclusion of a self-lock 16. The modular structure of the primary gearing 12<br>
and secondary gearing 14 is designed so that the two modules 12, 14 connected<br>
together with releasable fixing means, for example screws or a fast closure, can<br>
be separated from each other quickly and easily. Thus, the pinion of the D-wheel<br>
is disengaged from the C-wheel. If a potentiometer 52 is arranged with a spur<br>
gear 48, the latter is also raised from the pinion of the B-wheel.<br>
It is further of essential significance that between the F-wheel and a housing part<br>
60 is fitted an integral self-lock 16. The rotationally stiff locking spring 18, with the<br>
correct spring strength and setting, prevents the two-part reduction gearing 10<br>
from being able to move out of the set working position, in the present case due to<br>
sufficient friction force between the legs of the locking spring 18 and at least one<br>
inner face of the C-wheel and housing part 60. Details are evident in figs 2, 3, 5<br>
and 6.<br>
Fig. 2 shows a first detailed embodiment of a self-lock 16 with a conical locking<br>
spring 18 of spring steel in the area of the primary gearing 12. Held in two housing<br>
parts 58, 60 is the gear wheel shaft 62 of the F-wheel which at the same time<br>
forms the spring guide for the locking spring 18. An upper longer spring leg 64<br>
and a lower shorter spring leg 66 is formed. The locking spring 18 is tensioned in<br>
the direction of axis L1 whereby the two spring legs 62, 64 are pressed onto the F-<br>
wheel and housing part 60, clearly both with the same force. Both spring legs 62,<br>
64 form a friction surface 68, 70. When the E-wheel of the drive motor 20 (fig. 1)<br>
exerts a torque on the F-wheel, the locking spring 18 with the shorter spring leg<br>
66 slips on the friction surface 70. This is evident in view of the lever law.<br>
Fig. 2 indicates two variants. A bore 74 in the housing part 60 can be closed in a<br>
first variant with a short trip cam 76 of a locking part 72 which corresponds at<br>
most to the thickness of the housing part 60. The friction force of the self-lock 16<br>
or locking spring 18 can be increased if the bore 74 is closed with a long trip cam<br>
80 of a closing part 78. This protrudes over the housing part 60 and blocks the<br><br>
shorter spring leg 66. On activation of the primary gearing 12, the shorter spring<br>
leg 66 knocks on the long trip cam 80 and cannot turn further. Therefore the<br>
longer spring leg 64 must turn on the friction surface 68, a higher resistance must<br>
be overcome than when both spring legs 64, 66 can rotate freely. Thanks to the<br>
switchable self-lock 16, two different self-locking forces are available.<br>
Clearly, fig. 2 can also be formed inversely as the shorter spring leg 66 lies on the<br>
wheel F, the longer spring leg 64 on the housing part 60. A switchable self-lock 16<br>
is also possible in this way. Furthermore, the self-lock can be modified if for<br>
example spacers are placed between the F-wheel and the housing part 58. The<br>
two spring legs 64, 66 are thus pressed with greater or lesser force on the F-<br>
wheel or housing part 60, which affects the friction resistance. Finally, the self-lock<br>
can be modified in that one or both friction surfaces 68, 70 are coated and/or<br>
mechanically roughened e.g. by ribbing.<br>
The self-lock 16 could in principle be attached to a gear wheel other than the F-<br>
wheel, but the effect is greater the closer it is located to the E-wheel of the drive<br>
motor 20.<br>
Fig. 3 shows a self-lock in which the helical locking spring 18 is attached to wheel<br>
F. This can for example be achieved with a spring washer 82. In the lower area<br>
the locking spring 18 is attached to a spring plate 84 which in the area of the bore<br>
74 lies freely on the housing part 60 and establishes the outer friction surface 68.<br>
In the central area the spring plate 84 has a coaxial peg 86 protruding<br>
downwards. A lifting bolt 88 which is coaxial in relation to longitudinal axis L1 can<br>
be raised and lowered in the direction of double arrow 90 for example by means<br>
of an eccentric lever not shown. The spring plate 84 can be lifted from the housing<br>
part 60, the inner friction surface 70 is now formed by the peg 86 and lifting bolt<br>
88. On rotation of the wheel F, the locking spring 18 also turns, as does the rotary<br>
table 84. The friction resistance is greater or smaller depending on the position of<br>
the lifting bolt 88. This self-lock 16 is also switchable.<br><br>
Fig. 4 shows the switching of the self-lock 16 in fig. 2. The locking spring 18 is<br>
mounted rotatably about the spring guide which is the gear wheel shaft 62 of<br>
wheel F. On activation of wheel F (fig. 2) the shorter spring leg 66 knocks on the<br>
long trip cam 80 and thus blocks the rotation of the locking spring 18 which thanks<br>
to its rotationally stiff design is only deformed by a few degrees. In view of the<br>
large reduction, no spring back occurs on disengagement of the drive motor 20.<br>
Also with a view to fig. 2, fig. 5 shows an annular inner friction surface 70 with a<br>
smaller radius r on the housing part 60, of which a disc-like section is shown.<br>
Fig. 6 also shows an annular outer friction surface 68 on the wheel F which has a<br>
larger radius R.<br>
Fig. 7 shows the closure of a channel 92 with a lift valve 94 which in the present<br>
case is formed as a plug valve. The lift valve 94 can be activated by means of a<br>
linear motor which pushes the valve in the direction of double arrow 96 along the<br>
longitudinal axis L3. For the sake of simplicity the linear motor is not shown. The<br>
control of an airflow 98 with a reduction gearing 10 according to the invention (fig.<br>
1) is indicated. For this the rotational movement is translated into a linear<br>
movement.<br><br><br>
