The present application has been divided out of Indian Patent Application No.<br>
1602/KOLNP/2005. (hereinafter referred to as "parent application")<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[001] The field of the invention is composite structures comprising an inorganic,<br>
discrete phase and an organic additive, such as molded items, free-standing structural<br>
supports, wallboard, including paper-covered wallboard, panels, underlayment, sheathing<br>
board, moisture resistant board, type-X board, insulation board, shaft liner, soffit board,<br>
backing board, core board, ceiling board, cement board, gypsum glass mat board and<br>
gypsum fiber board, and integrated structures, and methods of manufacture thereof.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[002] Cellulose is a polysaccharide composed of individual anhydroglucose units which<br>
are linked through a glycosidic bond (Figure 16). The number 'n' of anhydroglucose units<br>
in the polymer chain is defined as the degree of polymerisation. Typically, production of<br>
cellulose ethers (CE's) involves replacing some of the hydroxyl hydrogen groups of<br>
cellulose with a substituent group, for example a methyl group, an ethyl group, a<br>
carboxymethyl group, a hydroxyethyl group, a hydroxypropyl group, or some<br>
combination thereof. For example, a hydroxyethyl methyl cellulose (HEMC) may be<br>
produced by replacing some of the groups of cellulose with hydroxyethyl groups and<br>
methyl groups. Likewise, a hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose (HPMC) may be produced<br>
with hydroxypropyl and methyl groups replacing some of the hydroxyl groups of the<br>
cellulose.<br>
[003] The number of substituted hydroxyl groups per anhydroglucose unit is expressed<br>
as the degree of substitution (DS). The DS can vary between 0 and 3. As with all polymer<br>
reactions, this reaction does not occur uniformly along the polymer chain. The reported<br>
degree of substitution is therefore a mean degree of substitution over the whole polymer<br>
chain. Alternatively, molar substitution (MS) may be used to report the number of<br><br>
-2-<br>
moles of substituent groups, such as a hydroxypropyl or hydroxyethyl group, per mole of<br>
anhydroglucose. Often, manufacturers follow a convention whereby one of the substituents<br>
is reported by DS and the other by MS, where the substituent reported by MS may replace<br>
a hydroxyl group or may attach to another substituent to form a graft. The DS is not<br>
always reported, and the value reported is often inaccurate or given as a broad range, as<br>
shown in Table I.<br>
[0004] In another alternative, the weight percent of substituents is reported.<br>
Weight percent of substituents may be directly related to DS and MS. For example, the<br>
following equations show the conversion for HPMC:<br><br>
[0005] Cellulose ethers are conventionally differentiated by type of substituent<br>
and the viscosity of an aqueous solution of the cellulose ether. For example methyl<br>
cellulose (MC), ethyl cellulose (EC), carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC), hydroxyethyl<br>
cellulose (HEC), ethyl hydroxyethyl cellulose (EHEC), ethyl hydroxypropyl cellulose<br>
(EHPC) and hydroxypropyl cellulose (HPC) are named for the type of substituent group<br>
used to replace the hydroxyl group in cellulose. The viscosity of an aqueous solution<br>
including a cellulose ether is an important characteristic for its typical use as a thickener;<br>
therefore, cellulose ethers are also differentiated by viscosity, which depends on the degree<br>
of polymerization (directly related to the measured molecular weight), and the type and<br>
degree of substitution of substituent groups. As the molecular weight increases, the<br>
viscosity of an aqueous solution of the cellulose ether increases also. However, the effect<br>
of the degree of substitution depends on the particular type of substituent group, which<br>
may also affect the viscosity of the cellulose ether.<br>
[0006] Manufacturers characterize the effect of a particular cellulose ether on<br>
the viscosity by reporting the measured viscosity of a 2 wt% aqueous solution of the<br><br>
-3-<br>
cellulose ether at 20 degrees centigrade. Herein, we refer to this 2 wt% viscosity as the<br>
viscosity grade of the particular cellulose ether. Typically, the viscosity grade is measured<br>
by one of two techniques: Brookfield and Ubbelohde. Often, the measured viscosity grade<br>
differs between the two techniques. For example, results using both techniques are shown<br>
in Table I for some cellulose ethers. Cellulose ethers, particularly low DS/MS cellulose<br>
ethers, may be insoluble in water at 20 degrees centigrade. The viscosity of water changes<br>
little with addition of 2 wt% of an insoluble, powdered additive; therefore, the viscosity of<br>
these insoluble cellulose ethers at 20 degrees centigrade is not representative of the effect<br>
of the change in viscosity after dissolution at a higher temperature. However, the<br>
molecular weight and the viscosity grade may be empirically related for a particular<br>
cellulose ether.<br>
[0007] A modified cellulose, also referred to herein as a cellulose derivative, is<br>
used in plaster and joint compounds as a thickener (or to modify the rheology in some way)<br>
and to improve the workability of gypsum-based compounds. Commercial cellulose ethers<br>
for such purposes are selected for their solubility in water at room temperature (e.g. 20<br>
degrees centigrade). Cellulose ethers have been known to improve some other properties,<br>
including the consistency, adhesion and water retention of gypsum-based joint compounds<br>
and tile adhesives. However, adhesion, water retention and thickening are considered<br>
detrimental in the production of some inorganic composite structures, such as gypsum-<br>
based wallboard. For example, wallboard is processed from a slurry that is continuously<br>
mixed and fed onto a belt. Thus, it is desirable for the slurry used to make wallboard to be<br>
more readily mixed and more quickly dried than a plaster, which is ordinarily formed or<br>
shaped by hand in a manual layering process. As a result, cellulose ethers are not selected<br>
for use in commercial wallboard manufacture.<br>
[0008] Calcined gypsum powder (calcium sulfate hemihydrate and/or calcium<br>
sulfate anhydrite) is usually mixed with water and a variety of additives, which are used for<br>
nucleating the growth of gypsum crystals, as anti-fungal agents, light weight fillers or<br>
reinforcing fibers. Dissolution of the calcined gypsum powder in the water and a resulting<br>
hydration reaction causes crystallization of gypsum crystals (calcium sulfate dihydrate)<br><br>
-4-<br>
forming a core of interlocking gypsum crystals. Application of multi-ply face sheets is<br>
usually integrated with the formation of the core into a wallboard. This is often followed<br>
by mild heating to drive off the remaining free (unreacted) water to yield a dry product,<br>
having face sheets adhered to gypsum core. Similarly, cement, such as Portland cement,<br>
may be made of a calcium sulfate that is hydrated to form hydraulic cement, which is widely<br>
used in concrete, and may be easily formed into many shapes.<br>
[0009] Tensile and shear strength of conventional, gypsum-based wallboard is<br>
related primarily to the strength of the facing paper, typically an oriented fiber, multi-ply<br>
facing paper that is applied to the gypsum-based slurry during a continuous forming<br>
process. For a 1/2 inch wallboard with a density of about 0.6 g/cc, approximately one-half<br>
of the nail pull resistance and two-thirds of the flexural strength are supplied by the paper<br>
face sheets, which also account for 40% of the manufacturing costs. The core is usually<br>
exceptionally poor at handling tensile loads of any kind<br>
[0010] Even compressive loads are limited for lower density wallboards without<br>
face sheets. Adding porosity and/or a low-density, expanded filler (e.g. perlite) into the<br>
conventional material reduces the core density. However, the strength of gypsum sheets<br>
decreases dramatically with density. For example, a dramatic decrease of the nail-pull<br>
resistance with density of 54-inch gypsum wallboard, both papered and non-papered, can be<br>
seen in Fig. 3.<br>
[0011] Fibers have been incorporated into gypsum-based wallboard and<br>
structural materials. Unfortunately, fibers in wallboard do not contribute to improved nail<br>
pull resistance at conventional levels of addition, as shown in Fig. 33.<br>
[0012] Sizing of fibers is a process that is well known in the textile industry and<br>
is used to prepare fibers for processing into fabrics, yarns and weaves, as described in<br>
co-pending application entitled "Construction Materials Containing Surface Modified<br>
Fibers" to Tagge et al., filed May 27, 2003, which is incorporated by reference herein in its<br>
entirety.<br>
[0013] Several unique challenges have thus far restricted the commercialization<br>
of inorganic composite strucutures including cellulose ethers as an additive. For example,<br><br>
-5-<br>
the nail pull resistance may be decreased by the addition of some cellulose ethers or an<br>
increase in nail pull resistance may require concentrations of polymers greater than 5 wt%,<br>
which can lead to problems such as inflammability, reduced extinguishability, commercially<br>
unacceptable cost of the wallboard, and mold susceptibility. Furthermore, addition of<br>
cellulose ethers increases the slurry viscosity to unacceptable levels, which interferes with<br>
the mixing and forming of composite strucutures. Therefore, there is a longstanding and<br>
unresolved need for an additive that can increase both the nail pull resistance and the<br>
flexural strength of wallboard core, allowing the core density to be reduced, without<br>
adversely affecting other properties of the gypsum-based product.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0014] A composite structure is produced using water, an inorganic material and<br>
an additive, which are mixed together, reacted and formed into the composite structure.<br>
Upon mixing with the water, the inorganic material, such as a calcium sulfate hemihydrate<br>
or another cementitious material, may dissolve or may partially dissolve in the water and<br>
hydrates, over time, forming an inorganic, discrete phase. Preferably, β-calcium sulfate<br>
hemihydrate is used; however, α-calcium sulfate hemihydrate or other cementitous<br>
materials maybe used, if the addition of water is adjusted to account for the changes in<br>
dissolution and porosity of these other materials or crystalline forms. The additive is a<br>
cellulose ether having a degree of substitution of a substituent group and viscosity grade of<br>
the cellulose ether selected such that the composite structure is substantially strengthened.<br>
[0015] Preferably, the weight percent of cellulose ether to calcium sulfate<br>
hemihydrate is selected to be no greater than 5 wt%, more preferably no greater than 3<br>
wt%, whereby the cellulose ether has a negligible effect on the inflamability and<br>
extinguishability of the wallboard. Even more preferably, the weight percent is no greater<br>
than 0.5 wt%, whereby the composite structure is substantially strengthened at a low cost.<br>
By "substantially strengthened," it is meant that the structural core of a composite<br>
strucuture containing an additive has an increase in nail pull resistance, flexural strength or<br>
modulus of rupture that is at least 30% greater than the equivalent (e.g. same fabrication<br><br>
-6-<br>
process is used and compared at the same composite density) core prepared without the<br>
additive. An increase of about 30% is believed to be commercially significant, providing an<br>
advantage to other ways of strengthening a gypsum-based composite structure that cost<br>
more, as well as competing favorably with other composite systems.<br>
[0016] In wallboard samples in which a paper layer or layers is applied, the<br>
wallboard core contributes about 25-33% of the overall strength. Thus, in comparing<br>
papered wallboard samples, "substantially strengthened" is taken to mean at least a 10%<br>
improvement in nail pull, flexural strength or modulus of rupture compared to the<br>
equivalent papered wallboard prepared with the same paper layer or paper layers but<br>
without the additive. Likewise, enhanced fiberboard core is compared to unenhanced<br>
fiberboard core (e.g. without the use of sizing on the fibers or an additive in the fiberboard<br>
core) to determine if the fiberboard is "substantially strengthened" by the additive or sizing.<br>
[0017] By a "slurry," it is meant that the mixture of dry ingredients and water<br>
forms a homogeneous fluid, dissolving at least a portion of the calcium sulfate hemihydrate<br>
in the water. For example, the slurry is a thixotropic fluid. The amount of water required<br>
depends, for example, on the amount and type of calcium sulfate hemihydrate, e.g. α or β<br>
the amount of additive and other dry ingredients, as well as the temperature and the type of<br>
additive or additives included in the slurry. The amount of water used in the slurry<br>
significantly alters the microstructure of the gypsum-base composite structure, for example,<br>
by affecting the amount of porosity, the extent of dissolution of the calcium sulfate<br>
hemihydrate, the rate of hydration and the morphology of the gypsum crystals. The<br>
microstructure affects the properties of the wallboard, such as the nail pull resistance and<br>
flexural strength.<br>
[0018] It should be understood that reported and measured viscosity grade<br>
varies considerably. Viscosity grade varies, for example, based on the use of different<br>
measurement techniques. For example, selection of the shear rate and spindle size used for<br>
measuring viscosity grade impacts the measured value. A variation of as much as 30%<br>
from the viscosity grade reported by manufacturers is to be expected at low viscosity<br>
grades, e.g. less than 100 cps. Viscosity grades greater than about 1000 cps show an even<br><br><br>
-7-<br>
greater variation in the viscosity grade from that actually measured and the viscosity grade<br>
reported by the manufacturer. Thus, any limits in viscosity grade stated herein should be<br>
understood as approximate values within these expected variations. Also, measuring the<br>
viscosity grade of a cellulose ether assumes that the cellulose ether dissolves in water at 20<br>
degrees centigrade. If the cellulose is insoluble in water at 20 degrees centigrade, then the<br>
addition of a particulate form of cellulose ether at an amount of only 2 wt% has little effect<br>
on the viscosity of the water. However, if the temperature of the water is changed such that<br>
the cellulose ether becomes soluble, then the viscosity of the mixture may increase rapidly.<br>
[0019] It should be understood that the mean value of the molecular weight for<br>
a specific type of commercial cellulose ether with a specific degree of substitution may<br>
vary, for example, between batches. Variations between batches allow for significant<br>
commercial variances in the mean and standard deviation from the mean of the molecular<br>
weight of a particular cellulose ether. Typically, the mean molecular weight may vary by as<br>
much as 20% from the manufacturer's specification. Also, the standard deviation of the<br>
molecular weight within a batch depends, for example, on manufacturing tolerances, the<br>
process chosen to manufacture a particular cellulose ether, and the variations already<br>
present in the raw cellulose prior to substitution. Thus, any limits for MW expressed herein<br>
should be considered approximate values within the expected variations.<br>
[0020] A nail pull index and flexural strength index are presented herein that<br>
normalize the measurements of nail pull resistance and flexural strength for wallboard and<br>
ceiling board specimens having a spectrum of board weights by comparing the strength<br>
measurements to the strength of specimens prepared without a strengthening additive at the<br>
same wallboard weight and thickness, but with all other factors such as stucco purity, other<br>
additions, forming process and testing conditions constant. For example, the nail pull<br>
resistance versus board weight without a strengthening additive is shown in Fig. 3 for<br>
specimens with and without paper. Thus, the nail pull index, as shown in Fig. 5 for some<br>
embodiments, is a comparative measure of the nail pull resistance of a reinforced specimen<br>
to a conventional specimen at the same density (board weight), and a nail pull index of 1.0<br><br>
-8-<br>
means that a reinforced wallboard specimen has the same nail pull resistance as a specimen<br>
of the same density that is prepared without a strengthening additive.<br>
[0021] Preferably, sizing solutions for coating particles and fibers that are used<br>
in the composite structure have a solids content and low viscosity allowing for easier<br>
processing than lower solids content or higher viscosity solutions. For example, a higher<br>
solids content may produce a greater fiber add in one pass than a lower solids content.<br>
Cellulose ether (CE) exhibits a high viscosity even at very low concentration in aqueous<br>
solutions, which severely limits the usefulness of a cellulose ether as a sizing for fibers.<br>
[0022] One approach to obtain sufficient add-on with CE is to use a heated<br>
dispersion at a temperature above the solubility limit of the CE. By avoiding or limiting<br>
dissolution of the CE, viscosity is reduced. However, the dispersion gels upon cooling.<br>
Thus, passing a chilled fiber through a heated dispersion facilitates add-on, for example.<br>
[0023] If the dispersion is allowed to cool, then the CE hydrates, causing rapid<br>
gelation and a concomittant increase in viscosity. Furthermore, hydration of the cellulose<br>
particles is irreversible. Thus, the entire batch must be maintained above the clear range.<br>
Therefore, this approach is only practical for a CE having a comparatively low dissolution<br>
temperature (e.g. a clear range temperature no greater than five degrees C above room<br>
temperature or less).<br>
[0024] It is possible to use a solvent other than water. For example, a cellulose<br>
ether may exhibit low solubility in alcohol. Thus, a dispersion of CE in alcohol allows the<br>
preparation of high solids content with low viscosity that are stable at room temperature,<br>
for example. However, the sizing deposited from dispersion of alcohol and CE is<br>
incoherent and weak, because much of the CE remains in the dispersion as discrete<br>
particles. Thus, in the absence of water, the sizing does not form a film on the fiber or<br>
particle to be sized. A method of incorporating a CE-based sizing on a fiber using a low<br>
viscosity sizing solution, providing good add-on, is a longstanding and unresolved need.<br>
[0025] In one example, a bio-active additive is included in the composite<br>
structure, such as an anti-fungal agent. For example, quaternized poly(vinylpyridine) and<br>
gluturaldehyde are anti-fungal agents. In one embodiment gluturaldehyde is added to the<br><br>
-9-<br>
cementitious slurry prior to forming a structural or finishing material, for example, as a<br>
surface coating on cellulose ethers. Another embodiment applies a bio-active additive to<br>
the surface of reinforcing fibers, such as quatemized poly(vinylpyridine). In yet another<br>
embodiment a bio-active additive is applied to a surface layer, for example a surface of a<br>
backing or facing layer. In another example, the bio-active additive is applied to a glass<br>
mat before the glass mat is added to a structural or finishing material. In a preferred<br>
embodiment, the bio-active additive is a functional group in a polymer system that increases<br>
the interaction between a reinforcing additive, such as fibrous or particulate reinforcements,<br>
and the matrix of a cementitious building material.<br>
[0026] In one example particulate or fibrous materials are chemically treated to<br>
provide mold-resistance, water repellency or anti-staining. The treatment is achieved using<br>
a solution and/or emulsion of functionally designed polymers that bond around or to the<br>
fiber surface upon drying and/or curing. A monomer, a functional group and/or a<br>
crosslinking agent of the formulation adhere to the fibrous surface, for example by reacting<br>
directly with the fibrous surface or with another component of the composition that itself<br>
adheres to the fiber surface. Herein mold resistance includes both bio-active measures that<br>
destroy mold or fungi and passive measures that merely inhibit mold growth. Preferably,<br>
the coating is bio-active, such as gluturaldehyde and/or quatemized poly(vinylpyridine).<br>
For example, the treatment modifies the particulate or fibrous surface with functional<br>
monomer or polymer appendages or a fine, insoluble coating. In one preferred<br>
embodiment, hydrophobic and hydrophilic groups are located in or attached to polymer<br>
chains or co-polymers in the formulation.<br>
[0027] One advantage is that the surface treatment may be durable and<br>
permanently bound to the particulate or fibrous surface and not dissolve in water,<br>
preventing migration or leaching of the bio-active component or passive inhibitor. Also, in<br>
one embodiment, the fibers may be treated prior to weaving of a textile, eliminating the<br>
need for a separate step of sizing the fibers prior to spinning and/or weaving textiles.<br><br>
-10-<br>
[0028] Another advantage is that the treatment may be applied to many<br>
materials, including paper, woven and non-woven glass mat, arid natural and synthetic<br>
textiles, as well as a variety of particulate and fibrous materials.<br>
[0029] Yet another advantage is that the treatment may provide an interface<br>
layer between the fibrous surfaces and the matrix that transfers tensile loads from the<br>
matrix to the fibrous reinforcements. Optionally, the interface layer interacts strongly with<br>
cement matrices and increases the pullout or peel strength of the fibrous materials. The<br>
scope of the invention includes interface layer compositions, e.g. sizing, that interact with<br>
cementitious materials, as well as cementitious compositions that interact with inclusions<br>
and additives, such as fibers and particles. Improved fibers and fabrics of the present<br>
invention may be used to reinforce different types of cements, such as gypsum and Portland<br>
cement, depending on the type of fiber and size selected.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
[0064] A gypsum-based composite structure is prepared using a mixture of a<br>
calcium sulfate hemihydrate, a reinforcing additive and water. For example, the calcium<br>
sulfate hemihydrate comprises one of a β-calcium sulfate hemihydrate, and α-calcium<br>
sulfate hemihydrate and a combination thereof. In one embodiment, the calcium sulfate<br>
hemihydrate is produced by calcining gypsum, for example. The reinforcing additive is a<br>
cellulose ether that is dispersable in water and may be produced and used in various forms,<br>
such as aqueous solutions, granules and powders. For example, cellulose ethers may be<br>
used with a wide variety of substituent groups, including HPC, HEC, MC, HPMC, EHEC,<br>
EHPC and HEMC. Preferably, the cellulose ether contains either a methyl group, an<br>
hydroxypropyl group, an hydroxyethyl group or a combination of these groups.<br>
[0065] In one alternative embodiment, the cellulose ether comprises at least one<br>
hydroxybutyl substitution.<br><br>
-14-<br>
[0066] The increased nail pull resistance and fiexural strength imparted to<br>
gypsum-based composite structures by the embodiments of the present invention offers<br>
new uses and markets for this inexpensive cementitious material. For example, a free<br>
standing poured structure may be molded that has exceptional strength and stiffness. In<br>
another example, a mold resistant wallboard can be fabricated with or without face sheets.<br>
The heavy, fiber-laden face sheets of conventional wallboard tend to feed mold growth.<br>
However, one embodiment of the present invention prevents mold growth.<br>
[0067] Also, cellulose ethers do not tend to feed mold growth when added to<br>
the wallboard core in amounts less than 5 wt%, as shown by mold resistance tests. For<br>
example, specimen maintained at 32degrees centigrade in an incubator with 90% humidity<br>
and in the presence of mold spores showed no mold growth after 24 days. In an alternative<br>
embodiment, a skim layer added to at least one surface provides even greater mold<br>
resistance or a treated surface is added that improves water repellency and/or the<br>
antimicrobial and antifungal properties of the composite structure. There is a longstanding<br>
and unresolved need for low cost gypsum-based structures having such mold resistance.<br>
[0068] In another example, a lightweight wallboard with a conventional multi-<br>
ply facing sheet or sheets, may be fabricated by reducing the density of the wallboard core<br>
without sacrificing the nail pull resistance of the wallboard. For example, the density may<br>
be reduced below 0.75 g/cc using a lightweight filler or by introducing porosity into the<br>
core in the form of voids or air bubbles while maintaining the flexural strength and nail pull<br>
resistance of the wallboard.<br>
[0069] Addition of an excess amount of water to the slurry, over and above the<br>
stoichiometric amount of water needed to hydrate the powdered dry ingredients, reduces<br>
the density of the wallboard core. It is believed, without being limiting in any way, that the<br>
excess water originally fill voids in the wallboard core, and after drying, the voids remain as<br>
porosity in the wallboard core. A general, empirical correlation has been found for<br>
predicting the wallboard density in g/cc (ρ) with the water to powdered dry ingredient ratio<br>
(W:P), if foaming is limited by using comparatively low mixing speeds: ρ =<br>
0.8324(W:P)-0.7629. The addition of foaming, whether by rapid stirring or addition of a<br><br>
-15-<br>
foaming agent, may further reduce the density by introducing porosity into the wallboard<br>
core in addition to the amount introduced by the excess water.<br>
[0070] By adding additional water to the slurry, viscosity of the slurry is<br>
reduced. Thus, a slurry containing substantially no clay may be extruded in a continuous<br>
extrusion process, forming a gypsum-base composite structure. By "substantially" no clay,<br>
it is meant that no clay is added to the dry ingredients as a rheology modifier. Of course,<br>
clay may be present as an impurity in the dry ingredients or the water at a level that does<br>
not significantly affect the rheology of the extrusion process.<br>
[0071] One method of producing gypsum-based composite structures mixes dry<br>
ingredients comprising calcium sulfate hemihydrate powder and a powdered additive<br>
selected from cellulose ethers other than CMC. For example, the cellulose ether may be<br>
selected to be soluble in water at a temperature of 20 degrees centigrade and to have a<br>
degree of methyl substitution less than 1.8 (e.g. from 1.2 to 1.8 for MC that is soluble in<br>
water at 20 degrees centigrade). Alternatively, the cellulose ether may be selected to be<br>
soluble in water at a higher temperature range, such as greater than 30 degrees centigrade,<br>
allowing dissolution to be delayed by maintaining a processing temperature less than the<br>
dissolution temperature range until mixing or forming of the composite structure is<br>
completed. An hydroxypropyl molecular substitution of less than 4 wt% or greater than 8<br>
wt%'also shows a dramatic improvement in the ability of HPMC to stregthen an inorganic,<br>
discrete phase, for example. Other ingredients, including reinforcements, antifungal agents,<br>
fire retardants and sag reducers, may also be added to the gypsum-based structure. In one<br>
alternative embodiment, a cellulose ether is added in an amount less than 1 wt% to calcium<br>
sulfate hemihydrate, and the preferred methyl degree of substitution is greater than 1.8.<br>
[0072] Surprisingly, selection of the degree of substitution (DS) of one or more<br>
of the substitutional groups may result in a substantial increase in flexural strength and nail<br>
pull resistance. For example, a low DS (e.g. less than 1.6) is preferred for methyl cellulose.<br>
In one embodiment, a methyl cellulose is selected to have a DS in the range from 1.2 to<br>
1.5, because a the methyl cellulose is soluble in water at 20 degrees centigrade and may be<br>
mixed in the slurry without modification of processing conditions for forming the<br><br>
-16-<br>
composite structure. In another embodiment, the methyl cellulose is selected to have a DS<br>
less than 1.2, preferably in a range from 0.02 to 1.0, more preferably from 0.02 to 0.2,<br>
which reduces the visocity of slurry while the temperature of the slurry is maintained at a<br>
temperature less than the dissolution temperature of the cellulose ether. Advantages<br>
include increased strength or the ability to select a lower viscosity grade or to reduce the<br>
amount of cellulose ether, while achieving the same increase in strength. For example, by<br>
lowering the viscosity grade of the methyl cellulose, the slurry becomes easier to mix if the<br>
amount of water remains unchanged. By making the slurry easier to mix, the<br>
microstructure of the material is made more homogeneous, which further increases the nail<br>
pull resistance, for example. Alternatively, less water can be used, and the wallboard dries<br>
quicker with the same slurry viscosity and may have a higher density and absolute strength.<br>
Also, lowering the fraction of methyl cellulose to calcium sulfate hemihydrate reduces the<br>
manufacturing cost of the wallboard. Other cellulose ethers may be selected to have a<br>
degree of substitution (and molecular substitution if applicable) such that the cellulose ether<br>
is either soluble in water at 20 degrees centigrade or insoluble in water at 20 degrees<br>
centigrade and such that the composite structure is substantially strengthened.<br>
[0073] It is preferable, for maximizing strength and nail pull resistance, to select<br>
a high viscosity grade, e.g. at least 100 cps and a high molecular weight (MW), e.g. at least<br>
10,000 MW, for a methyl cellulose having a methyl DS between about 1.2 and 1.8. More<br>
preferably, the DS is in a range of 1.2 to 1.5. For maximizing strength, HPMC or HEMC<br>
is even more preferable than methyl cellulose. For example, a molecular weight of HPMC<br>
of 1 million cps achieves exceptional improvements in both nail pull resistance and flexural<br>
strength when the HPMC is added as part of a gypsum-based composite panel. The<br>
selection of the degree of substitution of both the methyl groups and the hydroxypropyl or<br>
hydroxyethyl groups may substantially increase the strength of the composite structure,<br>
compared to non-optimized, commercially available HPMC and HEMC. This is a<br>
surprising and unexpected result, which has not been known previously.<br>
[0074] In one example, an amount of water is selected to form a slurry with the<br>
dry ingredients that results in a finished wallboard core density of 0.75 g/cc after extrusion,<br><br>
-17-<br>
setting and drying in an oven at 45 °C. In other embodiments, many other additives,<br>
including other cellulose ethers may be added to tailor the properties of the wallboard core<br>
without diminishing the nail pull resistance and strength of the wallboard core.<br>
[0075] In one embodiment, these dry ingredients are well mixed to thoroughly<br>
disperse the additive throughout a calcium sulfate hemihydrate powder. Then, the dry<br>
ingredients are added to and mixed with water, poured into a form, formed into a sheet,<br>
allowed to set, dried and trimmed. The amount of water is selected in excess of the<br>
amount needed for extrusion and the stoichiometric amount needed to form gypsum from<br>
the calcium sulfate hemihydrate and water. Preferably, the amount of water is selected to<br>
produce a wallboard core with a density less than 0.8 g/cc, more preferably less than 0.75<br>
g/cc, even more preferably in a range from 0.45 g/cc to 0.7 g/cc for lightweight wallboard.<br>
[0076] As one alternative embodiment, a foam may be added to the slurry, to<br>
reduce the density to a preferred range for a specific application. For example, a foaming<br>
agent, such as a surfactant or chemically active foaming agent, may be added in the water<br>
and/or the slurry to create a foam during stirring of the water and/or slurry. Adding a foam<br>
may result in a shorter drying time and/or a more preferable distribution of the porosity<br>
than a process that would produce a wallboard with an equivalent density by merely<br>
increasing the amount of water. Alternatively, a low density filler may be added, such as<br>
expanded polystyrene or perlite.<br>
[0077] The process may be a continuous process, whereby the dry ingredients<br>
are mixed, added to the water, blended into a slurry and the slurry is extruded onto a<br>
moving surface to form the wallboard core. Alternatively, a form may both contain the<br>
slurry and form the edges of the wallboard. Optionally, one or more rolls or restrictions<br>
spread and flatten the free surface of the slurry, whereby an elongated sheet is formed. In<br>
one embodiment, the elongated sheet is a continuous wallboard core supported on at least<br>
one side. Following forming of the continuous wallboard core, the end of the elongated<br>
sheet of slurry, after being allowed to set at least partially, is cut into lengths from the rest<br>
of the elongated, continuous sheet. Then, the wallboard is trimmed if necessary and dried.<br>
Alternatively, one or more facing sheets may be added during the process on one or both<br><br>
-18-<br>
sides of the wallboard core. Alternatively, a facing sheet is added after the wallboard is<br>
formed into sheets, such as by gluing or spraying a surface layer.<br>
[0078] Another method of producing the wall board mixes a strengthening<br>
additive with the water before mixing with a powdered calcium sulfate hemihydrate. In this<br>
method, the additive, whether dry, paste, gel or liquid, is at least partially dissolved in the<br>
water. Then, the dry ingredients, including the calcium sulfate hemihydrate and optionally<br>
other dry additives, are added to and mixed with the aqueous solution to form a slurry or<br>
paste. The slurry or paste is then formed into a gypsum-based structure.<br>
[0079] In another example, one or more paper layers may be adhered to one or<br>
more sides of a wallboard core as facing sheets, for example, for decorative purposes<br>
and/or to impart improved strength. The paper may. have fibers, which may be oriented to<br>
strengthen the wallboard in a preferred direction. Alternatively, no paper layers may be<br>
added or a non-paper layer may be adhered to one or both sides of the wallboard core. In<br>
yet another alternative, a second additive may be included in the dry ingredients that<br>
segregates to one or both surfaces of the wallboard, forming an in situ surface layer on the<br>
wallboard. In yet another embodiment, reinforcing particulates or fibers may be added, for<br>
example, throughout the core or on a surface of the core.<br>
[0080] If a methyl group is added substitutionally to the cellulose ether to make<br>
a methyl cellulose, it is preferable that the degree of substitution is less than 1.8. More<br>
preferably, the degree of substitution is no greater than 1.5. It is preferable that the methyl<br>
degree of substitution in methyl cellulose is greater than 1.2, which makes the methyl<br>
cellulose soluble in water.<br>
[0081] In one embodiment, the cellulose ether additive is of HPMC and/or<br>
HEMC. For example, as viscosity grade of HPMC decreases from one million cps to 10<br>
cps, the nail pull index generally decreases. Thus, it is preferable to use a high viscosity<br>
grade for an increased nail pull index; however, there is a trade-off. A high viscosity grade<br>
increases the viscosity of the slurry, unless additional water is also added or a DS is<br>
selected that prevents dissolution of the cellulose ether until after the composite structure is<br>
formed, such as during drying. If the cellulose ether is soluble in water at the temperature<br><br>
-19-<br>
of the water during mixing, then a highly viscous slurry may be difficult to mix or form;<br>
therefore, selection of the preferred viscosity grade depends on the amount of water used<br>
and vice versa. Also, an increase in water in the slurry is associated with a lower density in<br>
the fabricated composite structure, which leads to a reduction in strength and nail pull<br>
index compared to a denser gypsum-based structure. In one embodiment, a water reducer,<br>
such as a lignin sulfonate or napthalene sulfonate condensate, is added to control the slurry<br>
viscosity and excess water content.<br>
[0082] The percent substitution of specific cellulose ethers, which were used as<br>
reinforcing additives, were analyzed in accordance with standard test method ASTM D<br>
3876, which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. ASTM D 3876 determines<br>
methoxyl (methyl) and hydroxypropyl (HP) substitution in cellulose ether products by gas<br>
chromatography. The resolved substitution percentages of the various cellulose ethers,<br>
along with the measured viscosity grades, were compared to the mechanical testing results<br>
to determine the effect of the degree of substitution on flexural strength and nail pull<br>
resistance. Based on these empirical measurements, correlations were developed that relate<br>
the nail pull index and the flexural strength index to cellulose ether substitution pattern.<br>
The following regression models established the best correlation:<br><br>
wherein:<br>
γ = cellulose ether viscosity grade (cps) (2% Ubbelohde)<br>
M = cellulose ether methoxyl percent substitution<br>
H = cellulose ether hydroxypropyl percent substitution<br>
f = cellulose ether wt% (g /100g stucco)<br>
wherein Ai, Bi, Ci, Xi, Yi, and Zi are defined in Table 2.<br>
[0083] These empirical correlations are useful in defining the effect of each of<br>
the weight percentage of cellulose ether (f), the degree or percent of substitution of the<br><br>
-20-<br>
methyl (M) and hydroxypropyl (H) groups, and the viscosity grade (γ) on the nail pull index<br>
and flexural strength index of wallboard core reinforced by MC and HPMC. Additional<br>
analysis shows that HEMC behaves similarly to the correlation for HPMC. It is believed,<br>
without being limiting, that the correlation is valid in a range of viscosity grade from 5 cps<br>
to 1,000,000 cps; methyl substitution from 21% to 38%; hydroxypropyl substitution from<br>
2% to 10%; and an amount of addition from 0.25 \vt% to 5 wt%, if the cellulose ether is<br>
soluble in water at 20 degrees centigrade. It is also believed that the observed trends are<br>
likely to extend beyond these limits in some cases.<br>
[0084] Specifically, there is a correlation of the amount of cellulose ether<br>
additive in the wallboard core and the nail pull index and flexural strength index. The nail<br>
pull resistance and strength increases with increasing weight percent of additive, e.g. when<br>
more MC and/or HPMC is added to the slurry. There is also a correlation with viscosity<br>
grade. Surprisingly, the data shows that increasing viscosity grade increases the nail pull<br>
index and flexural strength index for HPMC and MC, which was not reflected in the<br>
literature or in some of the raw data, for example, as shown in Fig. 14 for MC. The<br>
viscosity grade tends to increase with the molecular weight; therefore, increasing molecular<br>
weight also tends to increase nail pull index and flexural strength.<br>
[0085] There is a very surprising and unexpected correlation with the percent<br>
substitution of particular substitutional groups. For methyl cellulose, the nail pull index<br>
increases with decreasing degree of substitution (DS), as shown in Figs. 19 and 20, for<br>
example. This unexpected and surprisingly strong correlation is sufficient to explain the<br>
dramatic inflection in the nail pull index versus viscosity grade curve shown in Fig. 14, for<br>
example. In Fig. 14, the commercially available MC had a percent substitution of methyl<br>
groups of 34% compared to 28% methyl substitution for the MC used in the adjacent data<br>
point with lower viscosity grade. This has gone unnoticed by others, and, as a result,<br>
commercial MC has a comparatively high degrees of substitution. This may have<br>
discouraged others from adding methyl cellulose to wallboard as a strengthening additive.<br>
[0086] Manufacturers seldom openly report the DS for commercial cellulose<br>
ethers. If reported, it is often highly inaccurate. Thus, to perform this analysis, it was<br><br>
-21-<br>
necessary to independently measure the percent substitution by gas chromatography,<br>
Otherwise, the correct correlation was not discemable for methyl cellulose (MC),<br>
hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose (HPMC), and hydroxyethyl methyl cellulose (HEMC). In<br>
the range of weight percent addition of reinforcing additive most practical for wallboard,<br>
e.g. less than 5 wt% or more preferably less than 3 wt%, even modest increases in the DS<br>
of methyl cellulose substantially decrease the measured flexural strength index of wallboard<br>
compared to structures using a lower DS, as shown in Figs. 19 and 20. Also, at even lower<br>
weight percent addition of additive, e.g. less than 1 wt% of HPMC, the effect of viscosity<br>
grade tends to diminish compared to the effect of degree of substitution, increasing the<br>
importance of selecting an appropriate degree of substitution.<br>
[0087] As shown in Fig. 21, a HPMC-reinforced gypsum- based panel, using 1<br>
wt% of HPMC with a viscosity grade of 100 cps, is preferably prepared using a percent<br>
substitution of methyl groups less than 30 wt% (DS of 1.8) and a percent substitution of<br>
hydroxypropyl groups no greater than 4 wt% or at least 8 wt%.<br>
[0088] In Fig. 22, a HPMC with a viscosity grade of 10 cps has, preferably, a<br>
substitution of methyl groups less than 30 wt% (more preferably 25 wt% - a DS of 1.5).<br>
The preferred hydroxypropyl substitution is either no greater than 4 wt% or at least 6 wt%.<br>
A percent substitution of at least 6 wt% HP is more preferable than a substitution of no<br>
greater than 4 wt%. So long as insolubility of the HPMC in water at 20 degrees centigrade<br>
is allowed by the process of manufacturing a composite structure, it is preferable to select<br>
an HPMC with a decreased or increased degree of HP substitution beyond that available in<br>
any known commercial HPMC such that the composite structure has improved strength.<br>
[0089] Fig. 23A shows the correlation for HPMC with a viscosity grade of<br>
1,000 cps. In this case, the preferred percent substitution of methyl groups is the same as<br>
in Figs. 21 and 22; however, the effect of the hydroxypropyl substitution is about the same<br>
for a HP substitution of 4 wt% or 8 wt%. The change with HP substitution is merely a<br>
fraction of the change with methyl substitution.<br>
[0090] In Fig 23B the correlation at a viscosity grade of 10,000 cps is shown.<br>
As for 1000 cps, the effect of methyl substitution is greater than the effect of HP<br><br>
-22-<br>
substitution. This trend continues for viscosity grades of 100,000 and 1 million, as shown<br>
in Figs. 24A-24B. Preferred embodiments have a low DS of methyl groups and an<br>
hydroxypropyl substitution either no greater than 4 wt% or at least 8 wt%. The nail pull<br>
index at these high viscosity grades is as great as double that of a gypsum-based structure<br>
prepared without addition of the cellulose ether.<br>
[0091] Figs. 25A-28F compare the effect of degree of substitution for additive<br>
additions of 0.25 wt%, 0.5 wt% and 2 wt%, respectively. With small HPMC additions,<br>
e.g. less than 1 wt%, and at low viscosity grade, e.g. less than 1000 cps, the effect of<br>
hydroxypropyl substitution is dramatic.<br>
[0092] For example, at 0.25 wt% of HPMC and a viscosity grade of 10 cps, the<br>
nail pull index of a gypsum-based panel with addition of HPMC having an HP substitution<br>
of less than 6 wt% is less than one. This means that the nail pull resistance is less than that<br>
of a gypsum-based panel having no cellulose ether additive. However, a panel may be<br>
substantially strengthened (e.g. greater than 1.3) at a substitution of at least 8 wt% and a<br>
methyl substitution of at least 35 wt%. Surprisingly, the trend for the nail pull index with<br>
methyl substitution at low HPMC addition (e.g. 0.25 wt%) and high HP substitution (e.g.<br>
at least 8 wt%) is the opposite of the trend at high HPMC addition.<br>
[0093] At a viscosity grade of 100 cps, as shown in Fig. 25B, the nail pull index<br>
is again substantially strengthened at an HP substitution of at least 8 wt%. However, some<br>
strengthening occurs even at HP substitution levels greater than 2 wt%. The point where<br>
the effects of methyl substitution DS reverses shifts to higher HP substitution levels. Figs.<br>
25C-25F show that the trend continues with increasing viscosity grade. Increasing<br>
viscosity grade both increases the nail pull index across the board and tends to reduce the<br>
slope of the nail pull index versus HP substitution curve. While HP substitution greater<br>
than 8 wt°/o continues to substantially increase the nail pull index compared to 2 wt%, the<br>
rate of increase at high viscosity grades (e.g. at least 1000 cps) is not as great as the rate of<br>
increase at lower viscosity grades (e.g. less than 1000 cps). Nevertheless, a nail pull index<br>
of about 1.6 in the correlation is predicted with an additional of only 0.25 wt% of HPMC<br><br>
-23-<br>
to calcium sulfate hemihydrate if the correct values of methyl and hydroxypropyl<br>
substitution are selected for the HPMC additive.<br>
[0094] As shown in Figs. 26A-27F, as the amount of HPMC addition is<br>
increased further, the nail pull index is generally increased; however, the slope of the nail<br>
pull index versus HP substitution curves tend to be reduced. In Figs. 27A-27F, with an<br>
HPMC addition of 2 wt%, HP substitution of no greater than 4 wt% is more preferable<br>
than HP substitution of at least 8 wt%. Further increases in the amount of HPMC addition<br>
greater than 2 wt% tends to further increase the slope of the portion of nail pull index curve<br>
for HP substitution no greater than 6 wt%. This means that the rate of increase in NPI<br>
with a reduction in HP substitution is even greater as the amount of HPMC approaches 5<br>
wt%<br>
[0095] At amounts of HPMC of at least 2 wt%, a nail pull index of greater than<br>
2.0 is achieved by selecting a low HP substitution (e.g. no greater than 6 wt%), a low<br>
methyl substitution (e.g. no greater than 1.8), and/or a high viscosity grade (e.g. at least<br>
1000 cps). As viscosity grade increases, the comparative effect of changing the amount of<br>
HP substitution tends to decrease, but some additional strengthening is imparted to the<br>
structure at low HP substitution.<br>
[0096] Results for HEMC are also analyzed to select preferred ranges for the<br>
degree of substitution of methyl and hydroxyethyl groups. From these results, it is clear<br>
that preferred ranges will emerge as a wider selection of HEMC materials is fabricated for<br>
testing, having preferred methyl and hydroxyethyl substitutions. The same procedure is<br>
used for selecting HEMC for use as a reinforcing additive as was used for HPMC. Prepare<br>
samples of HEMC having a range of substitution levels, viscosity grades, and amount of<br>
HEMC addition to calcium sulfate hemihydrate. Determine, by testing, an important<br>
strength parameter, such as the nail pull index, and calculate a correlation for selecting an<br>
HEMC that meets or exceeds the improvement needed for commercial success of the<br>
additive.<br>
[0097] Initial results with HEMC show a behavior similar to HPMC. The<br>
degree of substitution of the methyl group may be selected to substantially increase<br><br>
WO 2004/065319 PCT/US2004/001957<br>
-24-<br>
strength of the composite structure. The hydroxyethyl substitutional groups tend to<br>
improve the nail pull index at either low or high percent substitution, depending on<br>
concentration and viscosity grade. Thus, the molecular substitution of hydroxyethyl groups<br>
in HEMC shows a pattern consistent with the effect disclosed for the hydroxypropyl<br>
groups of HPMC.<br>
[0098] At low viscosity grade, e.g. less than 100 cps, the effect of substitution<br>
on the measured index of nail pull and flexural strength is dramatic. The amount of methyl<br>
substitution and/or hydroxypropyl or hydroxyethyl substitution is sufficient to change the<br>
nail pull index from a decrease to a substantial increase, as shown in Figs. 19, 20 and 25A.<br>
Commercially available methyl cellulose typically have a DS of at least 1.8 (30 wt%). High<br>
viscosity grades were avoided, because a high viscosity grade makes mixing and forming<br>
more difficult. It is not surprising that cellulose ethers have been overlooked as an additive<br>
for strengthening gypsum-based structures. Indeed, the most promising cellulose ethers,<br>
for example MC, HPMC and HEMC have not been available for testing from commercial<br>
suppliers at substitutional levels optimized for substantially strengthening gypsum-based<br>
composite structures. As can be seen in Table 1, commercially available HPMC and MC<br>
have levels of HP and methyl substitution that do not optimize the nail pull index and<br>
flexural strength of gypsum-based composite structures.<br>
[0099] In one embodiment, dry β-calcium sulfate hemihydrate powder and<br>
powdered HPMC are mixed together, dispersing the powdered HPMC additive throughout<br>
the p-calcium sulfate hemihydrate powder. The dry ingredients are then added to water,<br>
including an excess of water beyond that required to hydrate the p-calcium sulfate<br>
hemihydrate stoichiometrically, forming a slurry by stirring of the powder/water mixture.<br>
For example, the amount of water used is selected such that the finished wallboard has a<br>
density less than 0.85 g/cc, preferably less than 0.75 g/cc for lightweight structures. Then,<br>
the slurry is formed into a shape, for example, by pouring into a mold or extruding through<br>
a die or a form or a series of dies and forms. In one alternative, the extruded slurry is then<br>
fed onto a belt as a continuous sheet. The slurry is allowed to harden, which is also<br>
referred to as setting. Setting is a result of the calcium sulfate hemihydrate at least partially<br><br>
WO 2004/065319	PCT/US2004/001957<br>
-25-<br>
dissolving and hydrating, forming calcium sulfate dihydrate crystals, referred to herein as<br>
gypsum crystals.<br>
[0100] Then, the setting gypsum-based composite structure is dried. Air drying<br>
or drying in a furnace evaporates the excess water that has not reacted during hydration.<br>
For example, forced connection of dry air over the surface of composite is used to remove<br>
most, if not all, of the excess water.<br>
[0101] Tests include measuring the nail pull resistance, flexural strength,<br>
humidified deflection, mold resistance, and inflamability, using ASTM standard test<br>
procedures, for example. Mold resistance is defined as showing no signs of mold growth<br>
on a wallboard or wallboard core surface after 24 days of exposure to mold spores within<br>
an environment maintained at 90% humidity and a temperature of 32°C.<br>
[0102] In one embodiment, cellulose ethers used as additives to the wallboard<br>
slurry are selected to have a high molecular weight and a high viscosity grade.<br>
Surprisingly, both nail pull resistance and flexural strength are greatly increased for<br>
cellulose ethers other than CMC at particular, as shown in Figs. 1 and 2. Also, it is very<br>
surprising that both nail pull index and flexural strength index increase rapidly with<br>
increasing molecular weight and viscosity grade for some cellulose ethers, for example as<br>
shown in Figs. 7 and 15. This contradicts those references that indicated that high viscosity<br>
grades and high molecular weights would weaken the gypsum crystal strength or be<br>
detrimental to strength at all but very low additions of the cellulose ethers. It is believed,<br>
without being limiting, that conventional wisdom erred, in part, because the effect of<br>
degree of substitution was not appreciated, previously.<br>
[0103] Specimens of high molecular weight and high viscosity grade HPMC<br>
reinforced wallboard and HEMC reinforced wallboard have the greatest value of nail pull<br>
index of those tested, as shown in Fig. 1. Other embodiments show greatly improved nail<br>
pull index, as well, especially using high viscosity grade cellulose ethers.<br>
[0104] In one embodiment, a low degree of substitution of methyl groups is<br>
preferred, e.g. less than 1.6. In an alternative embodiment, a wallboard comprising<br><br>
-26-<br>
additions of HPMC less than 1 wt% of the calcium sulfate hemihydrate preferably has HP<br>
substitution of HP groups greater than 6 wt% substitution in the cellulose ether polymer.<br>
[0105] Fig. 5 shows that for high molecular weight and high viscosity HPMC,<br>
HEMC, and HEC, the nail pull resistance increases logarithmically with the weight fraction<br>
of additive. This is a desirable trend, making for a robust and forgiving manufacturing<br>
process. 400 cps MC shows a linear increase in nail pull resistance with weight fraction of<br>
additive, which is also desirable.<br>
[0106] CMC is one of the most commonly used cellulose ethers, but, in the<br>
absence of other cellulose ethers, commercially available CMC retards setting time and<br>
reduces nail pull resistance and flexural strength compared to unreinforced specimens.<br>
Commercially available CMC does not increase the strength of wallboard at the<br>
concentrations, high molecular weights and viscosities that are effective for the other<br>
cellulose ethers.<br>
[0107] A surface treatment may coat the cellulose ethers to delay the onset of<br>
dissolution, which would be expected to improve dispersion of the cellulose ethers in<br>
water. In practice, it is believed that the delay in dissolution caused by the surface<br>
treatment resulted in incomplete dissolution of the surface treated cellulose ethers, unless<br>
dissolution of the cellulose ethers was achieved prior to hydration of the, calcium sulfate<br>
hemihydrate.<br>
[0108] Iodine stain tests showed that cellulose ethers that were surface treated<br>
did not disperse evenly throughout the wallboard specimen, especially for HEC surface-<br>
treated powders, while both untreated cellulose ethers and surface treated cellulose ethers<br>
that were pre-dissolved showed complete and even dispersion throughout the wallboard.<br>
One method of improving dispersion of untreated and surface-treated powdered cellulose<br>
ethers was to pre-mix the dry cellulose ethers until the powders were well dispersed with<br>
the dry calcium sulfate hemihydrate before adding the mixture to water. Thereby, the<br>
agglomeration of the cellulose ethers was reduced and dissolution occurred more readily<br>
than for agglomerated particles.<br><br>
-27-<br>
[0109] The nail pull index of surface treated cellulose ethers was less than the<br>
nail pull index of either pre-dissolved, surface treated cellulose ethers or untreated cellulose<br>
ethers, as shown in Figs. 1 and 2, and as shown against weight fraction, for example in Fig.<br>
11 for HPMC with a viscosity grade of 45,000 cps (45 kcps) and in Fig. 13 for HEC with a<br>
molecular weight of 1.3 million (1.3 M).<br>
[0110] The flexural strength is not affected as greatly by incomplete dissolution,<br>
as shown versus weight fraction in Fig. 12 for HPMC at 45 kcps. It is believed that the<br>
difference between the effects in nail pull index and flexural strength index is due to the<br>
insensitivity of the flexural strength to localized weakness in the structure. The flexural<br>
strength index is less sensitive to crushing of the specimen of the core (distributed stresses)<br>
than the nail pull index (localized stresses).<br>
[0111] Fig. 8 shows a minimum board weight projected for meeting ASTM<br>
standards versus viscosity grade of wallboard specimens prepared with a weight percent of<br>
HPMC additive to P-calcium sulfate hemihydrate of 1 wt%. Fig. 29 shows the effect of<br>
viscosity grade and amount of additive on the nail pull index calculated from the correlation<br>
for HPMC having 30 wt% substitution of methyl groups and 5 wt% substitution of<br>
hydroxypropyl groups in the cellulose ether. As the viscosity grade increases the minimum<br>
board weight that is required to pass ASTM standards decreases. In addition, using an<br>
HPMC with a more preferred substitution further reduces minimum board weight needed<br>
to achieve minimum ASTM standards. Also, other reinforcements, such as fibers added to<br>
the slurry, should further reduce the minimum board weight required to pass ASTM<br>
standards. Thus, one embodiment of the invention is a wallboard comprising a low density<br>
core and meeting or exceeding ASTM standards for wallboard.<br>
[0112] In one embodiment, the wallboard core comprises gypsum, a cellulose<br>
ether and cellulose fibers. Other fiber reinforcements, such as glass, polymer and carbon<br>
fibers, are optionally substituted or added to increase the flexural strength of the wallboard<br>
core. In one specific embodiment, short polyester fibers or nylon fibers or both are mixed<br>
into the dry ingredients prior to adding the dry ingredients to water to increase the flexural<br><br>
-28-<br>
strength. Longer fibers can be introduced during extrusion to provide the core with<br>
oriented strengthening along the longitudinal direction of the wallboard.<br>
[0113] Slurry viscosity is a concern in high speed wallboard production.<br>
Increased viscosity can lead to increased mixing and pumping demands, clogged machinery,<br>
and problems with board formation. Slurry viscosity is of even greater importance when<br>
selecting a CE additive because the primary purpose of CEs in conventional plaster<br>
formulations is to thicken the mixture.<br>
[0114] In order to fully hydrate the β-calcium sulfate hemihydrate and prepare a<br>
slurry that can be mixed and extruded, a greater amount of water is used than is used for<br>
plaster compounds, which use hydration of α-calcium sulfate hemihydrate to form gypsum.<br>
It is known that the amount of water added to the slurry has a profound effect on the<br>
quality and microstructure of the resulting wallboard. It is believed, without limiting the<br>
invention in any way, that addition of too little water prevents adequate mixing of the<br>
slurry, while too much water causes porosity in the wallboard core. There can be a<br>
dramatic increase in viscosity with the addition of cellulose ethers, especially in<br>
formulations with elevated levels of high viscosity cellulose ethers, which can make it<br>
difficult to adequately mix the dry ingredients and the water. Furthermore, an increase in<br>
viscosity can prevent the slurry from being poured into a form. One simple test that can be<br>
used to determine slurry viscosity is a "party test" in which some amount of slurry is poured<br>
from a designated height and the resulting patty diameter is recorded. Furthermore, the<br>
rheology of wallboard slurry is a function of time, humidity and temperature.<br>
[0115] In general, the patty size increases inversely with an increase in the<br>
viscosity grade of a cellulose ether. As expected, the patty diameter increases with<br>
decreasing viscosity grade for HPMC. In fact, patty diameter increases logarithmically<br>
with the inverse of viscosity grade; therefore, the nail pull index increases proportionally<br>
with the inverse of patty size, as shown in Fig. 9. Thus, a trade-off occurs between<br>
increasing the viscosity grade to increase strength and the effect of viscosity grade on<br>
mixing and further processing of a slurry.<br><br>
-29-<br>
[0116] In one embodiment, a slurry was formed by mixing β-calcium sulfate<br>
hemihydrate with less than 5 wt% of a powdered cellulose ether, such that the cellulose<br>
ether was evenly dispersed throughout the mixture. The mixture was then mixed with an<br>
amount of water to form a slurry, such that the wallboard core had a density of less than<br>
0.8 g/cc upon drying. In an alternative embodiment, the cellulose ether was selected to<br>
have a molecular weight of at least 10,000 and a viscosity grade of at least 100 cps, and<br>
both the nail pull resistance and flexural strength were improved compared to unreinforced<br>
wallboard. In another embodiment, the amount of powdered cellulose ether was limited to<br>
a range of 0.5 wt% to 3 wt%, and the measured nail pull index continuously increased with<br>
addition of powdered cellulose ether. In yet another embodiment, the amount of cellulose<br>
ether is limited to less than 1 wt%, more preferably no greater than 0.5 wt%, and the<br>
cellulose ether is selected of HPMC and HEMC having a methyl substitution of at least 25<br>
wt%, more preferably at least 30 wt%, and a substitution of the hydroxymethyl or<br>
hydroxyethyl of at least 6 wt%, more preferably at least 8 wt%.<br>
[0117] In yet another embodiment, the DS is limited to a range between 1.2 and<br>
2.4 for a MC. In an alternative embodiment, the DS is limited to a range from 1.2 to 1.8<br>
for a MC, having a viscosity grade of at least 10 cps, as shown in Figs. 14 and 15, for<br>
example. Fig. 14 shows a graph of nail pull index versus MC viscosity grade with 0.25,<br>
0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 wt% of MC mixed with powdered P-calcium sulfate hemihydrate. The<br>
darker lines and point are the values calculated using a correlation, which is discussed<br>
elsewhere, while the lighter lines are the experimental values. Fig. 15 is a similar graph for<br>
HPMC mixed with powdered P-calcium sulfate hemihydrate. In another alternative<br>
embodiment, a DS range from 1.2 to 1.6 for a MC substantially increases the flexural<br>
strength index and substantially increases the nail pull index for MC additions at a weight<br>
percent of 0.25 and 0.5 wt%, as shown in Fig. 19, which is based on the correlation used in<br>
Fig. 14. Fig. 20 shows that this trend applies also to higher weight percent additions of<br>
MC. This shows that substantially increasing nail pull resistance occurs for a gypsum-<br>
based panel having a MC with low DS, high viscosity grade, large amount of MC and/or a<br>
combination of these.<br><br>
-30-<br>
[0118] In yet another embodiment, the gypsum-based composite structure is a<br>
wallboard having a density less than 0.85 grams per cubic centimeter (g/cc) having a core<br>
comprising gypsum crystals and a strengthening additive dispersed throughout the gypsum<br>
crystals. The core, without the addition of any face sheets, has a nail pull resistance that<br>
meets or exceeds the nail pull resistance for ASTM Standard C36-95b, which is<br>
incorporated herein in its entirety. Minimum nail pull resistance for various thickness of<br>
wallboard is shown in Table IV. In another embodiment, the wallboard core has a flexural<br>
strength and humidified deflection that also meets or exceeds the requirements of ASTM<br>
Standard C36-95b. Generally, it is the nail pull resistance that is the critical, limiting<br>
strength criterion for commercially useful reduced-paper wallboard. Humidified deflection<br>
may become important for ceiling board, and flexural strength may be critical for handling<br>
of paperless wallboard during transportation and installation.<br>
[0119] In another embodiment, the gypsum-based composite structure has a<br>
barrier layer on the surface of the board, such as another gypsum layer. For example, a thin<br>
gypsum layer, which may have little or no strengthening additive present, may be<br>
incorporated onto one or both surface layers of the wallboard core using a thin skim layer,<br>
for example, as is known in the art. The skim layer may be prepared by mixing stucco and<br>
water without the addition of the strengthening additive. This thin skim layer forms a<br>
dense, smooth protective layer on one or more surfaces and may incorporate a different<br>
additive, such as a fungicidal additive or a different strengthening additive from that of the<br>
core.<br>
[0120] In another specific embodiment, the gypsum-based composite structure is<br>
a reduced paper wallboard having a density of less than 0.85 grams per cubic centimeter<br>
(g/cc), more preferably less than 0.75 g/cc, and a core comprising gypsum crystals and a<br>
strengthening additive dispersed throughout the gypsum crystals, the core having flexural<br>
strength that meets or exceeds the flexural strength requirements for ASTM Standard C36-<br>
95b. Specifically, the average breaking load of the wallboard core shall be not less than the<br>
load shown in Table IV for a wallboard core with the wallboard thickness listed in Table<br><br>
-31-<br>
IV. In another alternative embodiment, the wallboard core has a humidified deflection that<br>
also meets or exceeds the requirements of ASTM Standard C36-95b.<br>
[0121] In one preferred embodiment, the amount of strengthening additive in the<br>
core is less than 5 wt. % of the calcium sulfate hemihydrate that is used to form the gypsum<br>
crystals, such that inflammability and extinguishability meet the standards for both<br>
residential and commercial use.<br>
[0122] Method A and Method B of Table IV refer to the methods so designated<br>
in ASTM test method C473-95, which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.<br>
[0123] One or more face sheets may be adhered to the surface of the core, while<br>
retaining mold resistance. For example, a single sheet of decorative paper may be applied<br>
to the surface of a lightweight core. The decorative face sheet allows the surface of the<br>
wallboard, exposed after installation, to be treated as any ordinary wallboard. Thus, taping<br>
and searing joints, wallpapering, painting, and other finishing processes are completed the<br>
same as for conventional wallboard, using the single decorative paper face sheet. The face<br>
sheet may also provide abrasion resistance and improved flexural strength and/or nail pull<br>
resistance.<br>
[0124] In one embodiment, the gypsum-based composite structure has an<br>
insulative face sheet on one or more surfaces. For example, the insulative face sheet may<br>
be a single layer or multiple layers of a foil, including but not limited to an aluminum foil.<br>
The insulative face sheet may provide a barrier to radiation heat transfer. Alternatively, the<br>
face sheet may be a vapor barrier. In addition, the face sheet may provide abrasion<br>
resistance during shipping and handling of the wallboard. Alternatively, a decorative face<br>
sheet on one side of the wallboard is combined with an insulative face sheet on the other<br>
side of the wallboard.<br>
[0125] Another embodiment has a core and a thin protective layer at one or<br>
more surfaces of the wallboard. For example, a protective layer may be formed in situ<br>
during the setting process. By including a soluble additive in the slurry, which migrates<br>
with water, segregation of a highly concentrated layer of the additive may be accomplished<br>
during drying of an excess amount of water added to the slurry. Some water soluble<br><br>
-32-<br>
polymers, such as poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) and the polyamine curing component of epoxy,<br>
migrate with water to the surface of the wallboard during the drying and setting process.<br>
Also, some dissolved starches and boric acids migrate with water. Specifically, if an excess<br>
of water is present in the slurry, a drying process, for example at an elevated temperature,<br>
removes excess water from the wallboard from one or more surfaces by evaporation. In<br>
one alternative embodiment, post-processing is used to make the protective layer insoluble<br>
to water. For example, a titanium alkoxide or titanium tetraethoxide may be sprayed onto<br>
cellulose ethers, making them insoluble in water. Specifically, the reaction between<br>
titanium alkoxides and cellulose ethers requires heat, and in one embodiment the reaction<br>
occurs during drying of the wallboard, when the wallboard is heated to evaporate the<br>
excess water. Alternatively, a photosensitive polymer may be chemically sensitive to light,<br>
for example, U.V. light or sunlight and may produce crosslinking that makes the protective<br>
layer insoluble.<br>
[0126] In one alternative, the protective layer is a water-soluble antifungal<br>
chemical that may be either polymeric or monomeric, such as quarternized amines, for<br>
example. For example, poly(vmylpyridium bromide) and tetramethylammonium chloride<br>
both migrate to the surface with evaporating water and provide an antifungal layer on the<br>
surface of the wallboard. Alternatively, a protective layer is applied to the surface of the<br>
wallboard by spraying a coating on one or more surfaces of the core, for example, or by<br>
introducing the layer as a skim layer. For example, the surface of the gypsum-based<br>
structure is protected by either forming a protective skim layer and extruding the gypsum-<br>
based structure onto the skim layer or by forming the core and adding a skim layer.<br>
[0127] In another embodiment, abrasion resistant surfaces are formed on the<br>
gypsum-based composite structure by introducing reinforcements onto one or more<br>
surfaces. In one example, abrasion resistant surfaces are formed by co-extrusion or co-<br>
molding of an abrasion resistant surface on a structural core. Alternatively, abrasion<br>
resistant surfaces are formed after forming the structural core by introducing<br>
reinforcements prior to the setting of the surfaces of the gypsum-based composite<br>
structure. In one embodiment, the reinforcements are fibrous, such as glass fibers, cellulose<br><br>
-33-<br>
fibers and/or polymer fibers. Alternatively, the reinforcements may be participate<br>
reinforcements, such as spherical particles or flakes. Also, a combination of particles and<br>
fibers may be used. In an alternative embodiment, a protective layer is applied to the fiber-<br>
reinforced surfaces, e.g. a skim layer.<br>
[0128] In yet another embodiment of the present invention. The gypsum-based<br>
composite structure is a wallboard comprising a core, a protective layer and a face sheet,<br>
which includes multiple plies. The face sheet enhances the nail pull resistance of the<br>
wallboard, while reducing the number of paper plies. Furthermore, the multiple plies in the<br>
face sheet need not add to the flexural strength of the wallboard. Therefore, a lower grade<br>
ply may be used than for conventional wallboard. Thus, such wallboard costs less than<br>
wallboard using conventional oriented fiber paper plies. For example, paper plies made of<br>
recycled newspaper may be used in the face sheet.<br>
[0129] As yet another embodiment of the present invention, the gypsum-based<br>
composite structure comprises a core having a second phase dispersed throughout the core.<br>
For example, the second phase is porosity, a reinforcement, an expanded filler and/or a<br>
filler. If the second phase is porosity or an expanded filler, then the density of the<br>
wallboard core is reduced. For example, paperless wallboard having a density less than<br>
0.75 g/cc. Alternatively, a reinforcement, such as fibrous or particulate reinforcements,<br>
enhance the flexural strength and nail pull resistance of the core. As another alternative, a<br>
low cost filler may simply reduce the cost of the gypsum-based composite structure.<br>
[0130] In another example, the gypsum-based composite structure is a<br>
reinforced, paperless wallboard. Unreinforced, paperless wallboard is very dense, frangible<br>
and difficult to handle, whereas paperless, reinforced wallboard solves these longstanding<br>
and unresolved needs. The nail pull resistance, mold resistance and flexural strength results<br>
for reinforced, paperless wallboard specimens show that wallboard can now be<br>
manufactured that meets or exceeds the ASTM standards for nail pull resistance, having<br>
reduced weight compared to conventional papered wallboard, and eliminating the multi-ply<br>
paper layers that feed mold growth, satisfying a longstanding and unresolved need in a very<br>
competitive marketplace. Furthermore, the total installed cost of the some of the<br><br>
-34-<br>
alternative embodiments is comparable to the installed cost of conventional papered<br>
wallboard.<br>
[0131] It is believed, without being limiting in any way, that intermolecular<br>
interactions, such as hydrogen bonding, immobilize the cellulose ether molecules, making<br>
them precipitate during setting and drying of the gypsum core and prevent migration to the<br>
surface of the structure. The degree of interaction between molecules and between a<br>
molecule and gypsum is affected by molecular weight, which is reflected in the increase in<br>
strength with viscosity grade. It is also affected by the degree of substitution. Also, the<br>
addition of larger amounts of a cellulose ether causes precipitation to occur earlier, given<br>
the same amount of water, because of the limited solubility of cellulose ethers in water.<br>
Thus in selecting a specific cellulose ether as a strengthening additive, it is believed that the<br>
strength of the wallboard depends not only on the amount of cellulose ether added, but also<br>
the solubility and mobility of cellulose ether. Furthermore, it is believed that the solubility<br>
and mobility depend on both the degree of substitution and the weight percent of the<br>
addition, as shown by the correlations and figures.<br>
[0132] In another alternative embodiment, a foam may be produced to further<br>
reduce the density of the wallboard core. This foam may be produced, for example, using a<br>
surfactant and stirring of the water and/or slurry to generate a foam, which may be<br>
incorporated into the extruded wallboard core.<br>
[0133] In yet another embodiment, sodium trimetaphosphate (STMP) was<br>
added. Preferably, STMP is added in a range from 0.02 wt% to 1 wt%. STMP is used as<br>
a sag reducer in ceiling board. As shown in Fig. 28, STMP has a surprising synergy with<br>
the cellulose ether reinforced, gypsum-based composite structure. The toughness, defined<br>
as the area under the load displacement curve in Fig. 28, is greatly increased for a panel<br>
having both a cellulose ether and STMP compared to a panel missing either the cellulose<br>
ether additive or the STMP or missing both (control). This is highly surprising, because<br>
STMP usually embrittles gypsum-based wallboard, and undesirably reduces the toughness,<br>
as shown by the reduced area under the curve for the gypsum-based panel prepared using<br>
STMP alone, without a cellulose ether additive, having a shorter displacement to failure<br><br>
-35-<br>
than even the control panel. Both the stiffness and toughness of the cellulose ether<br>
reinforced panel is improved by introduction of STMP in to the composite. Furthermore,<br>
there is surprisingly little less in the displacement to failure with the addition of the STMP.<br>
[0134] In yet another embodiment, the gypsum-based composite structure is<br>
fiber-reinforced. The composite strength and toughness of fiber-reinforced cementitious<br>
materials is strongly dependent on the interface between the fibers and the matrix, such as<br>
the cementitious materials used in building materials. If the fibers have little interaction<br>
with the cement matrix, and thus poor interfacial adhesion, the strength of the composite<br>
will not be significantly improved regardless of the strength of the fibers or the level of fiber<br>
loading. Instead, fiber pullout occurs. Incorporation of foam or lightweight filler into the<br>
matrix to reduce the density of the cementitious building materials exacerbates fiber<br>
pullout. The pullout characteristics of fibers in the matrix determine their potential for<br>
reinforcing a particular cement. In co-pending application entitled "Construction Materials<br>
Containing Surface Modified Fibers, to Tagge et al., filed May 27, 2003, a method for<br>
modifying the surface of a reinforcing additive is disclosed, which is incorporated herein by<br>
reference.<br>
[0135] In one embodiment, co-polymers are polymerized from a mixture of<br>
fluoro-aliphatic (meth)acrylate monomers, hydroxyalkyl (meth)acrylate monomers, stearyl<br>
(meth)acrylate monomers and chlorinated monomers. Herein, the co-polymers of this<br>
embodiment are referred to as fluoro-polymers; however, these co-polymers may actually<br>
contain little or no fluorinated groups, depending on the desired application.<br>
[0136] In one example, the fluoro-polymers are applied to fibrous surfaces using<br>
an anhydride functional polymer and a catalyst. In this example the anhydride group<br>
chemically binds to the functional groups of a fiber and crosslinks the hydroxyl groups, for<br>
example, binding to hydroxyl groups of water and oil repellant polymers imparts an<br>
impermeable surface to the fibers by integrating the functionally designed polymer on the<br>
surface. In another embodiment, a cross-linking agent, such as an organic titanate,<br>
diisocyanate, metal salt or another reactive, functionalized polymer or pre-polymer, is used<br>
in place of an anhydride functional polymer.<br><br>
-36-<br>
[0137] In another embodiment, additional monomers with functional groups that<br>
are selected to react with a cross-linking agents are included in the fluoro-polymer<br>
synthesis. In one example, water and oil repellant and/or bio-active co-polymers contain<br>
monomers that react with metals, and a metal salt is used to crosslink the polymer. For<br>
example, additional monomers may contain other functional groups, such as, but not<br>
limited to, carboxyl, carboxylate, sulfate, sulfonate, phosphate and phosphonate groups.<br>
[0138] In one preferred embodiment, the surface modifier is selected to be a<br>
multifunctional molecule comprising at least one polymer group, e.g. monomer or<br>
oligomer, that binds the surface modifier to one of the reinforcement and the gypsum, and<br>
another polymeric group having a different function, such as bio-activity, hydrophyllic or<br>
hydrophobic moeity, oil repellancy, adhesion to cellulose, fire retardancy, antistatic<br>
properties and/or other functions.<br>
[0139] In an alternative embodiment, a functional co-polymer includes a reactive<br>
group that chemically bonds to a particulate or fibrous surface without crosslinking the<br>
polymer. For example, graft, block and random co-polymers of stearyl (meth)acrylate and<br>
maleic anhydride are used with or without a catalyst to increase the rate of chemical<br>
bonding between the functional co-polymers and the fibrous surfaces, including natural<br>
surfaces such as wood.<br>
[0140] In one method of treating fibrous surfaces, the fibers are incorporated<br>
into a fabric, such as a fiber mat or textile. The fabric is treated with the fluorpolymer,<br>
either before or after incorporation into the fabric. Next, the fabric is exposed to a solution<br>
or emulsion that binds one or more functional groups to the fiber surfaces, for example, by<br>
immersing the fabric in an emulsion or solution including a monomer, polymer or co-<br>
polymer and a metal salt. The treated fabric is then dried, cured and washed to remove<br>
undesired, residual components. Drying and curing is performed either under the same<br>
conditions or under differing conditions. For example, the temperature for curing may be<br>
either greater or less than the temperature used for drying.<br>
[0141] In an alternative method, a polymer is synthesized in situ on a fibrous<br>
surface by applying a solution or an emulsion including the desired monomers directly on<br><br>
WO 2004/065319	PCT/US2004/001957<br>
-37-<br>
the fibrous surface. A free radical initiator is applied either with the desired monomers or<br>
in a separate step, and the fibrous surfaces are exposed to heat or UV light, for example,<br>
after drying the fibrous surfaces. Then, the fibers, mat or textile is washed to remove any<br>
undesired, residual components.<br>
[0142] In one embodiment, bio-active functional monomers are included in the<br>
fluoro-polymer synthesis and impart mold resistance, such as anti-microbial and/or biocidal<br>
properties. Alternatively, crosslinking of a bio-active functional polymer, co-polymer or<br>
oligomer is achieved by including the bio-active component during application of a metal<br>
salt and/or free radical initiators. In another embodiment, both bio-active functionality and<br>
water and oil repellency are imparted in the same process.<br>
[0143] In another embodiment, bio-active functional monomers, oligomers, co-<br>
polymers or polymers are polymerized (or further polymerized or crosslinked) in situ<br>
around fibrous or particulate surfaces. In one example, another reactive polymer and/or a<br>
crosslinking agent is mixed together with the bio-active functional component, binding the<br>
bio-active functional component to the fibrous surface. In an alternative example, the bio-<br>
active functional components are functional groups pn monomers, oligomers, co-polymers<br>
and polymers, which are capable of binding to particulate and fibrous surfaces.<br>
[0144] For example, the monomers, oligomers, co-polymers and polymers bind<br>
to functional groups that are bound to the fibrous or particulate surface. Some examples of<br>
bio-active functional monomers, oligomers, co-polymers and polymers include, but are not<br>
limited to, quarternized amine functional groups, for example, having from 4 to 10 carbons<br>
in the alkyl chain. In one specific example, the fungicidal and bactericidal properties have<br>
been shown to kill mold after the mold contacts a bio-active coating on the surface of a<br>
textile.<br>
[0145] In one embodiment, fibers are first treated to provide a desired functional<br>
group on the surface of the fiber. Then, the fibers are incorporated into a mat or textile.<br>
For example, the fibers may be woven into a fabric or otherwise incorporated into the form<br>
of a mat or paper. The fibers may be combined with fibers having no coating or having a<br>
coating incorporating a different functional group, providing the paper, mat or fabric with<br><br>
-38-<br>
mold resistance and/or other desirable properties, such as a cohesive bond between the<br>
fibers and the matrix, based on the properties of treated fibrous surfaces.<br>
[0146] In one embodiment, a facing paper is treated on one surface to impart<br>
mold resistance and water repellency. The opposite surface is untreated or is treated in<br>
such a way as to provide the opposite surface excellent adhesion with a slurry that forms a<br>
wallboard core. Alternatively, the facing paper may be made of multiple plies. For<br>
example, an outer ply may be treated to provide bio-active and water repellency to a<br>
wallboard, while the innermost ply may be treated to adhere to the core of the wallboard.<br>
In another example, the outer ply may be treated for water repellency and one or more<br>
inner plies may be treated to impart bio-active properties. In yet another embodiment, the<br>
outermost ply on an exposed surface is treated to prepare the surface for plastering, stucco,<br>
painting, tarring or decorative papering. For example, the outermost ply may be treated to<br>
provide a self-stick surface for a later-applied layer, such as insulation or a decorative<br>
wallpaper.<br>
[0147] In one embodiment, a film forming polymer or mixture of polymers, at<br>
least one of which is an at least partially water-soluble or water-swellable strength enhancer<br>
is used as a surface modifier for fibers or is applied to a mat or a fabric. The composition<br>
may optionally include a bio-active component and/or a fire retardant to increase fire-<br>
resistance. The polymer is preferably cross-linked or treated to prevent complete<br>
dissolution of the polymer and subsequent migration away from the fiber during addition to<br>
water and subsequent drying. For example, a water-soluble, film-forming polymer utilized<br>
in a sizing composition preferably has a strong interaction with the cementitious matrix.<br>
Preferred strength enhancing, film forming polymers of the invention include, but are not<br>
limited in any way, to cellulose ethers other than CMC for gypsum-based composite<br>
structures.<br>
[0148] Fibers may be of any denier and length, ranging from continuous,<br>
bundled strands, such as those often used in woven meshes, to relatively short,<br>
monofilament fibers, such as those used for discrete fiber reinforcement and in some non-.<br>
woven mats. Herein denier is used as a measure of the fiber mass per unit length in milli-<br><br>
-39-<br>
grams per inch (rag/inch), which is an indirect measure of the fiber cross section.<br>
Alternatively, a polymer composition may be used as a binder in non-woven fibrous mats,<br>
the mats being used for reinforcing composite cementitious materials.<br>
[0149] Reinforced composite cementitious materials maybe used as, for<br>
example, fiber-reinforced cement for cast products, fiber-reinforced gypsum, such as glass-<br>
fiber-reinforced gypsum (GFG). Also, fabrics and paper are used with cement as a<br>
reinforcement, such as in joint tapes, patching kits, and molded articles. The fibers and<br>
fabrics, themselves, can be made by any conventional process or may be specifically<br>
designed with functional groups on the fibrous surfaces that react with the polymer<br>
additives or sizing. In one embodiment, conventional sizing equipment is configured to<br>
apply the polymer additive and to dry and crosslink the polymers. In one embodiment, the<br>
treated fibers are incorporated into the composites according to conventional methods by<br>
merely replacing existing fiber or fabric inclusions.<br>
[0150] It is thought, without being limiting in any way, that in one embodiment a<br>
polymer coating forms an interfacial layer of polymer-enriched slurry adjacent to the fiber.<br>
As the slurry dries, the polymer re-forms a film encapsulating the fiber and local gypsum<br>
crystals in the matrix surrounding it. The polymer binds the fiber to the matrix and<br>
reinforces the region surrounding the fiber. This results in an effective transfer of stress<br>
between the gypsum crystals and the reinforcing fiber when the composite is stressed. In a<br>
preferred embodiment, the amount of solids in the slurry is in a range from 0.5% to 50%<br>
with an add-on of from 1% to 500% of the fiber weight. Preferably, a sizing composition is<br>
selected having solids of from 2% to 20%, and add-on of from 20% to 500%. Strength<br>
enhancement in surface-modified, fiber-reinforced composites increases with higher<br>
amounts of polymer add-on.<br>
[0151] In one embodiment, the calcium sulfate hemihydrate is mixed with<br>
surface modified fibers, a second additive and water. The sizing composition for surface<br>
modifying the fibers is selected from one of a starch, a starch derivative, a cellulose<br>
derivative, an acrylic polymer (commonly polymerized from an acrylic acid, an acrylic salt,<br>
an acrylic ester, an acrylamide, a methacrylic acid, or an acrylonitrile monomer), a polyvinyl<br><br>
-40-<br>
acetate, a polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), an alginate, and a natural gum. Also, emulsions or<br>
dispersions of polyesters, polyurethanes, and styrene copolymers may be used.<br>
[0152] For example, wallboard reinforced by fibers coated solely with these<br>
formulations show some improvement in mechanical strength if the treated fibers are mixed<br>
into the slurry gently, as a final step. Also, excess water content must be minimized and<br>
drying carried out quickly, as low molecular weight and non-crosslinked additives dissolve<br>
in the water and tend to migrate away from the fibers and toward the surface of the<br>
wallboard over time during drying. However, without further treatment these additives<br>
often segregate to the surface and serve as nutrients for undesirable microbial, mold and<br>
fungus growth. Iodine staining techniques were used to observe this propensity for<br>
migration, for example, among poly vinyl pyrrolidone additives. Preferably, the surface<br>
modifying layer (surface modifier) has an interaction and/or bond with the hardening<br>
cement that improves interfacial strength without retarding the set. Alternatively, the<br>
surface modifier interacts with the additive, such as a cellulose ether, which is added to the<br>
matrix of a cementitious structure. In one embodiment, the surface treatment is somewhat<br>
soluble or swellable in water, resulting in an interfacial layer of polymer that adheres to the<br>
fiber and partially penetrates the crystallized particles of cement or gypsum.<br>
[0153] Preferably, high molecular weight sizing solutions have lower solids<br>
content than conventional sizes; however, the add-on is comparable, because the slurry<br>
viscosity is greater. Furthermore, cross-linking the surface coating creates a durable<br>
coating for fibers or fabrics that is not easily removed during the mixing, setting, or drying<br>
steps of fiber-cement production.<br>
[0154] For example, hydrophilic polymer systems are converted to swellable<br>
hydrogels upon cross-linking. It is believed, without being limiting in any way, that these<br>
swollen coatings allow cement crystal growth into fiber size while resisting erosion,<br>
dissolution, and migration. Fibers with cross-linked surface coatings are used in<br>
conventional high-speed mixing procedures such as those found in wallboard production.<br>
In one embodiment, the fibers are pre-mixed with dry components. Alternatively, the fibers<br><br>
- 41-<br>
are dispersed in water prior to cement mixing or are combined together with both the water<br>
and the calcium sulfate hemihydrate and other powdered additives.<br>
[0155] Several cross-linking methods are utilized to decrease the solubility of<br>
surface coatings. In one embodiment, a sizing is at least partially insolubilized by exposing<br>
the sizing to higher temperatures than normal during drying, causing crosslinking of the<br>
sizing. Sizing components such as starch and starch derivatives, PVA, CMC, and acrylate<br>
polymers, as previously listed above, crosslink at elevated temperatures. Conventional<br>
sizing avoids such temperatures to prevent the sizing from becoming insoluble, for<br>
example.<br>
[0156] In another embodiment, radiation, such as ultra-violet (UV) light or<br>
gamma rays, can also be used to cross-link some sizing components, such as polyvinyl<br>
pyrrolidone (PVP). In another embodiment, water-insoluble polymers are incorporated<br>
into a film forming polymer to physically cross-link the surface treatment. For example, a<br>
reactive polymer system, a system of reactive pre-polymers, or a latex, preferably with an<br>
internal cross-linker, may be mixed with hydrophilic polymers and reacted to lower the<br>
solubility of the resulting film on the additive.<br>
[0157] In an alternative embodiment, a film forming polymer is chemically cross-<br>
linked to form a hydrogel. For example, cross-linking agents for cellulose ethers include<br>
organic titanates, organic zirconates, and dialdehydes, such as glyoxal and gluturaldehyde.<br>
Borax and sodium trimetaphosphate are preferred for starches. Calcium chloride with<br>
peroxide, poly(styrene sulfonate) (PSS) and UV light are preferred for PVP. In one<br>
preferred embodiment, the cross-linking system is relatively stable and is preferably<br>
enhanced during or after drying by the elevated temperature, which allows swelling during<br>
setting but avoids migration of the polymer during drying and weakening of the bond if a<br>
cementitious building material becomes wet, for example, by flooding or exposure to high<br>
humidity.<br>
[0158] In one embodiment, HPMC is crosslinked by a chelated organic titanate<br>
which is activated at temperatures above 100 degrees centigrade. In another embodiment,<br>
a cross-linking agent is applied to only the outermost region of the surface coating, forming<br><br>
-42-<br>
a surface cross-linked polymer coating with delayed solubility. In another preferred<br>
embodiment, a surface coating polymerizes in situ on a fiber in combination with a<br>
crosslinldng agent. For example, the free radical polymerization of 1-vinyl 2-pyrrolidone<br>
with 1,6-hexanediol diacrylate is used to form a surface coating on a fiber for use in<br>
cementitious composite materials.<br>
[0159] In another embodiment, a coupling agent, such as a silane coupling<br>
agent, is included with the surface modifier formulation to improve the bond between the<br>
size and the fiber, promoting adhesion. Alternatively, the coupling agent is applied to the<br>
fibers or fabric as a primer before application of the surface treatment. In a preferred<br>
embodiment, a cross-linking agent, such as an organic titanate, acts as both the crosslinldng<br>
agent and the coupling agent, chemically bonding the surface treatment to the fiber, for<br>
example, via hydroxyl functional groups of the fibrous surface of a fabric.<br>
[0160] In one embodiment, the layer of the surface treatment adjacent to the<br>
fibrous surface is cross-linked by a coupling/crosslinking agent applied as a primer, but the<br>
exterior of the surface treatment is either not cross-linked or is less highly cross-linked than<br>
the surface treatment adjacent to the fibrous surface.<br>
[0161] In another preferred embodiment, a plasticizer, such as polyethylene<br>
glycol or glycerol, may be included in the surface coating composition to increase the<br>
flexibility and toughness of the coating.<br>
[0162] Preferred fibers to be sized include mono filament, bundled, and spun<br>
strands of various materials, including inorganic fibers, such as glass, mineral wool, and<br>
metal (e.g. steel), synthetic fibers, such as polypropylene, polyester, and nylon, and natural<br>
fibers, such as cotton, hemp, and wood. In one embodiment, bundled and chopped spun<br>
strands are designed to separate when mixed with the slurry, allowing the treated fibers to<br>
disperse and embed within the matrix material. In an alternative preferred embodiment, the<br>
sizing composition and slurry mixing conditions are controlled to maintain an intact surface<br>
modifier layer around a fiber bundle or strand, while allowing for some separation of the<br>
individual fibers. This provides a larger effective surface area of the fibers for adhesion to<br>
the size and cement matrix. The surface coating acts as a binder, allowing discrete bundles<br><br>
-43-<br>
or spun strands of fibers that would normally separate into individual filaments when mixed<br>
in a slurry.<br>
[0163] In one embodiment, the fiber is immersed in the surface coating material,<br>
dried, woven if desired, and cut to the desired dimensions in an automated process. For<br>
example, bundled fiberglass strands sized with a cross-linking CMC composition may be<br>
woven or arranged into a mesh and embedded as reinforcement in cement boards. In an<br>
alternative embodiment, chopped or other types of discrete fibers are sized by spraying<br>
them with a sizing solution while they are suspended in air. In yet another embodiment,<br>
individual fibers are coated by a surface coating in a solvent or emulsion and are<br>
agglomerated into a mat of fibers. Each of the coating processes may be repeated any<br>
number of times to achieve a desired thickness of add-on.<br>
[0164] In one embodiment, fibers are coated by a cellulose ether at an elevated<br>
temperature, at which the cellulose ether particles have low solubility. Powdered CE's are<br>
dispersed in hot water without hydrating or dissolving them, maintaining a low viscosity<br>
even at high concentrations of CE's. As the solution cools, as when exposed to a cool fiber<br>
or fabric or to air, the CE dissolves, forming a semi-solid gel. In an alternative<br>
embodiment, a surface-treated, delayed-solubility CE is used. Preferably, the surface-<br>
treated, delayed-solubility cellulose ether is coated with an aldehyde, more preferably a<br>
gluturaldehyde, which also impart anti-fungal properties to the fibers. For example, fiber<br>
immersion sizing (single or double) with a high molecular weight, high viscosity grade<br>
cellulose ether achieves an add-on thickness greater than 25%.<br>
[0165] In one embodiment, fabrics or papers are surface modified by immersing<br>
the fabric or paper sheet in the surface modifier. In another embodiment, a surface<br>
modifier is sprayed onto one or both sides a fabric or paper layer.<br>
[0166] In one embodiment, a fiber mat is formed by evenly dispersing chopped<br>
fibers in solution for surface treating the fibers. Then, the fibers are evenly spread, and the<br>
dispersion is drained over a wire mesh. Next, the fiber mat is dried, or, alternatively, the<br>
mat is first compressed to force liquid out of the mesh. For example, the fibers may be<br>
glass fibers, the surface coating may be PVP, and/or the PVP may be crosslinked by PSS or<br><br>
-44-<br>
UV light before or after the mat is dried. In an alternative embodiment, pressure or<br>
vacuum is applied before the wet fiber mat is dried, degassing the fibers and improving<br>
penetration of the surface coating.<br>
[0167] In one method of preparing a composite structure, a cellulose ether is<br>
added to the slurry or the wet mat or both. In one example, a methyl cellulose having a<br>
viscosity grade of 400 cps and 28 wt% methyl substitution (DS less than 1.7, e.g. as shown<br>
in Table 1) was used. The cellulose ether may be selected to be insoluble at normal<br>
processing temperatures for formation a composite structure, which may reduce the<br>
viscosity of the slurry or limit migration of the cellulose ether from the surface of a<br>
reinforcing fiber. For example, a cellulose ether having a low DS, e.g. less than 1.2, may be<br>
insoluble in water at 20 degrees centigrade. By increasing the processing temperature<br>
above the clear start temperature of the cellulose ether, such as during a setting and/or<br>
drying step, the cellulose ether may enter, at least partially, a dissolution range. The<br>
dissolved or partially dissolved cellulose ether may then interact with the surrounding<br>
discrete phases, such as fibers, crystals or other particulates, before reprecipitating. For<br>
example, the cellulose ether may reprecipitate when the composite structure temperature is<br>
no longer within the dissolution region of the cellulose ether or as the water evaporates or<br>
is used in an hydration reaction.<br>
[0168] In one preferred embodiment, intermingling of the polymer and the<br>
gypsum crystals in the matrix is increased by incorporating inorganic particles in the sizing<br>
formulation. For example, the inorganic particles, such as accelerant, act as seeds for the<br>
precipitation of gypsum crystals, causing crystals to grow directly from the surface coating<br>
and improving adhesion with the matrix. Also, inorganic particles may be added that act as<br>
a fire-retardant filler, improving the fire-resistance. Preferably, inorganic particles are<br>
ground gypsum ball mill accelerator for gypsum-based composite structures that use<br>
calcium sulfate hemihydrate to form gypsum crystals.<br>
[0169] In an additional embodiment, the surface coatings are used to coat other<br>
types and forms of materials in addition to fibers. For example, reinforcing polymer<br>
coatings can be used to coat reinforcing aggregate, lightweight filler and wire mesh. Also,<br><br>
-45-<br>
the surface coating may be added primarily for its bio-active properties, rather than as<br>
primarily a strengthening agent.<br>
[0170] In contrast to an unprotected textile, a textile having a thin layer of the<br>
bio-active polymer on the fibrous surfaces of the textile resists or prevents mold growth. In<br>
one example, a test exposed both a protected surface and an unprotected surface to the<br>
same mold-containing emulsion, which was then encouraged to grow by placing both of the<br>
samples in a warm, humid environment. After a short period of time, the untreated textile<br>
showed evidence of mold growth. In contrast, the sample having fibers coated with the<br>
bio-active polymer showed no mold growth for more than 24 days.<br>
[0171] In one alternative embodiment, the treatment is applied to a surface of a<br>
fabric or paper, such as a fiber-reinforced paper or a re-pulped, recycled paper, such that<br>
the treatment does not penetrate the surface or only partially penetrates the surface. Thus,<br>
the properties imparted to the fabric or paper have a functional gradient from the exterior<br>
surface toward the interior.<br>
[0172] In yet another embodiment, particulates of water soluble cellulose ethers,<br>
such as hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose and methyl hydroxyethyl cellulose ether, were<br>
treated to coat the surface with a layer of a dialdehyde to improve dispersal, delay<br>
dissolution and delay an increase in viscosity associated with mixing of the cellulose ether<br>
with water. In another example, a glyoxal was used for the same purpose. Both examples<br>
caused the desired delay in dissolution, as evidenced by the ability of the surface-treated<br>
cellulose ethers ready dispersion in water. Untreated particles immediately underwent<br>
gelation upon contact with the surface of the water and resisted dispersion in the water<br>
even with mild agitation.<br>
[0173] It is believed, without being limited thereto, that the gluturaldehyde is a<br>
bio-active material, inhibiting mold growth, while the glyoxal is a food source for mold<br>
growth, encouraging the growth of mold. In another example, glyoxal treated cellulose<br>
ethers used in preparation of reinforced gypsum wallboard showed enhanced mold growth<br>
in tests compared to gypsum wallboard using untreated cellulose ethers. It is believed that<br>
this is the first observation of this undesirable characteristic of glyoxal treated cellulose<br>
ethers, leading to the present development of gluturaldehyde as a beneficial replacement in<br><br>
-46-<br>
cellulose ether particulates in water, while providing anti-fungal and anti-microbial<br>
properties to wallboard, for example.<br>
[0174] As shown in Table VI, some examples of modified, commercial cellulose<br>
ethers exhibit inverse solubility, which means that the solute becomes increasingly insoluble<br>
as the temperature is increased above the lowest temperature in a cloud range. Cloud<br>
range and clear range in Table VI were determined using a small glass vial equipped with a<br>
magnetic stirrer bar and thermometer was charged with 10 g of a 0.5 weight % aqueous<br>
solution of modified cellulose ether. The vial was then placed in a 90°C water bath and<br>
heated until the modified cellulose ether had completely precipitated. To determine the<br>
dissolution temperature, the vial was then transferred to a room temperature water bath.<br>
The vial was reheated and cooled three times for three sets of cloud and clear ranges. Thus,<br>
for theses inverted solubility cellulose ethers, the clear start and clear stop occur by<br>
decreasing the temperature, because the cellulose ethers are soluble at room temperature<br>
and insoluble at elevated temperature, as illustrated in Fig. 31 A.<br>
[0175] Herein, the cloud range is defined as the range in temperature between<br>
the beginning of precipitation and the end of precipitation during heating (i.e. inverse<br>
solubility) or during cooling (i.e. additive insoluble in cold water) for a well mixed aqueous<br>
solution containing 0.5 wt% of solute. The cloud range may be used to determine the<br>
precipitation behavior of aqueous solutions comprising a modified cellulose ether additive<br>
during processes that include heating, such as mixing, drying and some setting processes.<br>
Also, the modified cellulose ethers show a dissolution hysteresis, meaning that precipitation<br>
occurs at a different temperature than dissolution, as shown in Figs. 31A and 31B. Thus,<br>
Table VI shows a separate clear range.<br>
[0176] As shown in Figs. 31A and 31B, the clear range is defined as the range in<br>
temperature between the beginning of dissolution and complete dissolution during cooling<br>
(i.e. inverse solubility) or during heating (i.e. additive insoluble in cold water). As is shown<br>
in Table VI, the cloud range and clear range of three examples having inverse solubility<br>
show significant variation. Furthermore, mixing different cellulose ethers together, it is<br>
possible to alter the clear range and cloud range temperatures (e.g. clear start, clear stop,<br>
cloud start and cloud stop). The clear range may be used to determine the dissolution<br>
behavior of a cellulose ether additive having an inverse solubility in a mixture including<br><br>
-47-<br>
water during processes that include cooling, such as forming, dewetting and other setting<br>
processes. Alternatively, for additives insoluble in cold water, the clear range may be used<br>
to determine the dissolution behavior during processes that include heating, such as setting<br>
and drying.<br>
[0177] Fig. 31A illustrates the inverse solubility that is typical of commercial<br>
cellulose ethers. As a warm aqueous dispersion containing a powdered cellulose ether<br>
cools, the onset of dissolution initiates at the clear start temperature and ends at the clear<br>
stop temperature, which may cause gelation of a slurry. During the dissolution process, the<br>
viscosity increases rapidly. Thus, mixing and forming operations may be impaired if the<br>
temperature of the slurry drops below the clear start temperature.<br>
[0178] In one embodiment, the degree of substitution or molar substitution of<br>
one or more of the substituent elements of a cellulose ether is selected such that the<br>
cellulose ether is insoluble in water at an initial processing temperature, such as in room<br>
temperature water (about 20 degrees) or at less than 30 degrees. In this case, as illustrated<br>
by Fig. 3 IB, the clear start and clear stop temperatures occur during heating of the mixture<br>
of cellulose ether and water. Preferably, the degree of substitution is selected such that the<br>
clear start is greater than the processing temperature during mixing of the slurry. For<br>
example, a clear start temperature of at least 30 degrees centigrade may be preferred to<br>
limit the solubility of the cellulose ether during mixing and forming steps such that the<br>
onset of substantial dissolution occurs only during setting or drying steps. This allows the<br>
slurry to be rapidly mixed and formed without the onset of a substantial increase in<br>
viscosity by dissolution of the cellulose ether additive.<br>
[0179] In one embodiment, cellulose ether derivatives are synthesized to provide<br>
strength enhancement of the structural material at a lower viscosity grade than<br>
conventionally available additives. For example, low degree of substitution (DS) methyl<br>
cellulose may be synthesized that provides substantial strengthening at reduced viscosity<br>
grade as shown in Fig. 33, which may reduce the slurry viscosity compared to using the<br>
higher viscosity grade additive to achieve the same level of strengthening. As previously<br>
mentioned, a reduction in slurry viscosity may be beneficial not only for reasons of material<br>
processing but also for the composite structures density, microstructure and strength.<br><br>
-48-<br>
[0180] In an alternative embodiment, the clear range and cloud range of<br>
synthesized cellulose ether derivatives are selected to avoid complete dissolution of the<br>
cellulose ether (clear stop) until the drying step, For example, an even lower DS may be<br>
selected for methyl cellulose, e.g. less than 1.2, more preferably 0.8-1.0, which limits the<br>
solubility of the methyl cellulose in cold water, but ensures solubility at a temperature less<br>
than the boiling point of water. For example, by designing the process of forming the<br>
composite structure to avoid dissolution, a low viscosity slurry may be mixed and formed<br>
into a shape, and the cellulose ether enters dissolution only during a step that includes<br>
heating of the slurry above a clear start temperature, such as during setting or drying. In<br>
another example, an hydroxyethyl cellulose is synthesized with a molar substitution (MS) in<br>
a range that prevents dissolution of the hydroxyethyl cellulose in cold water (i.e. a clear<br>
start of at least 30 degrees centigrade), more preferably the minimum MS is at least 0.4 or<br>
at least an MS that ensures that the HEC is soluble in water at less than the boiling point of<br>
water.<br>
[0181] In one embodiment, a wallboard core comprises gypsum, a cellulose<br>
ether and cellulose fibers. Other fiber reinforcements, such as glass, polymer and carbon<br>
fibers, are optionally substituted or added to increase the flexural strength of the wallboard<br>
core. In one specific embodiment, short polyester fibers or nylon fibers or both are mixed<br>
into the dry ingredients prior to adding the dry ingredients to water. Longer fibers can be<br>
introduced during extrusion to provide the core with oriented strengthening along the<br>
longitudinal direction of the wallboard. An additive may be added to the slurry that coats<br>
the fibers and/or a size may be added to the fibers in a separate sizing process before the<br>
fibers are incorporated into the structural material. Preferably, the size or additive or both<br>
bond the fibers to the gypsum crystals. For example, the gypsum crystals may be coated<br>
with a film-forming additive that binds the gypsum crystals together. A sized reinforcement<br>
according to one embodiment of the present invention forms a bond between the coated<br>
gypsum crystals and the surface modified fibers. It is thought, without being limiting in any<br>
way, that a percolation network of polymer interconnections synergistically reinforces the<br>
structural material, contributing to an increase in the pull-out strength of the fibers from the<br>
matrix.<br><br>
-49-<br>
[0182] For example, Fig. 34 shows a graph of the pullout strength improvement<br>
of several polymer additives versus the sizing add-on. High molecular weight cellulose<br>
ether and cellulose ether with an inhibitor display exceptional pullout strength improvement<br>
at very low add-on compared to other polymer systems.<br>
[0183] A sizing solution is prepared comprising an alcohol, water and a polymer<br>
additive, such as a cellulose ether. Alternatively, the sizing solution may be prepared using<br>
acetone as a replacement for the alcohol or in addition to the alcohol. For example, the<br>
alcohol may be any alcohol that is capable of dispersing two different cellulose ether<br>
components, has a vapor pressure greater than water and has limited or no cellulose ether<br>
solubility at room temperature. Preferably, the alcohol is isopropanol. Preferably, the<br>
solvent mixture is first mixed with a small amount of water prior to the addition of a<br>
cellulose ether, preventing separation or coagulation of the sizing solution, which might<br>
occur otherwise. By a small amount of water, it is meant an amount of water in the range<br>
that swells cellulose ether particles at the processing temperature of the size but avoids<br>
dissolution. The solids content and viscosity of the sizing dispersion may be controlled by<br>
adjusting the concentration of water and the cellulose ether. Some specific examples are<br>
listed in the examples section. It should be understood that other components may be<br>
added to the sizing dispersion to modify the properties of the dispersion or the size.<br>
[0184] In one embodiment, the treatment is applied to a surface of a fabric or<br>
paper, such as a fiber-reinforced paper or a re-pulped, recycled paper, such that the<br>
treatment does not penetrate the surface or only partially penetrates the surface. Thus, the<br>
properties imparted to the fabric or paper have a functional gradient from the exterior<br>
surface toward the interior.<br>
[0185] In one embodiment, co-polymers are polymerized from a mixture of<br>
fluoro-aliphatic (meth)acrylate monomers, hydroxyalkyl (meth)acrylate monomers, stearyl<br>
(meth)acrylate monomers and chlorinated monomers. Herein, the co-polymers of this<br>
embodiment are referred to as fluoro-polymers; however, these co-polymers may actually<br>
contain little or no fluorinated groups, depending on the desired application. In one<br>
example, the fluoro-polymers are applied to fibrous surfaces using an anhydride functional<br>
polymer and a catalyst. In this example the anhydride group chemically binds to the<br>
functional groups of a fiber and crosslinks the hydroxyl groups for example binding to<br><br>

-50-<br>
hydroxyl groups of water and oil repellant polymers imparts an impermeable surface to the<br>
fibers by integrating the functionally designed polymer on the surface. In another<br>
embodiment, a cross-linking agent, such as an organic titanate, diisocyanate, metal salt or<br>
another reactive, functionalized polymer or pre-polymer, is used in place of an anhydride<br>
functional polymer.<br>
[0186] In another embodiment, additional monomers with functional groups that<br>
are selected to react with a cross-linking agents are included in the fluoro-polymer<br>
synthesis. In one example, water and oil repellant and/or bio-active co-polymers contain<br>
monomers that react with metals, and a metal salt is used to crosslink the polymer. For<br>
example, additional monomers may contain other functional groups, such as, but not<br>
limited to, carboxyl, carboxylate, sulfate, sulfonate, phosphate and phosphonate groups.<br>
[0187] In an alternative embodiment, a functional co-polymer includes a reactive<br>
group that chemically bonds to a particulate or fibrous surface without crosslinking the<br>
polymer. For example, graft, block and random co-polymers of stearyl (meth)acrylate and<br>
maleic anhydride may be used with or without a catalyst to increase the rate of chemical<br>
bonding between the functional co-polymers and the fibrous surfaces.<br>
[0188] In one method of treating fibrous surfaces, the fibers are incorporated<br>
into a fabric, such as a fiber mat or textile. Then, the fabric is treated with the fluorpolymer<br>
either before or after incorporation into the fabric. Next, the fabric is exposed to a solution<br>
or emulsion that binds one or more functional groups to the fiber surfaces, for example, by<br>
immersing the fabric in an emulsion or solution including a monomer, polymer or co-<br>
polymer and a metal salt. The treated fabric is then dried, cured and washed to remove<br>
undesired, residual components. Drying and curing is performed either under the same<br>
conditions or under differing conditions. For example, the temperature for curing may be<br>
either greater or less than the temperature used for drying.<br>
[0189] In an alternative method, a polymer is synthesized in situ on a fibrous<br>
surface by applying a solution or an emulsion including the desired monomers directly on<br>
the fibrous surface. A free radical initiator is applied either with the desired monomers or<br>
in a separate step, and the fibrous surfaces are exposed to heat or UV light, for example,<br>
after drying the fibrous surfaces. Then, the fibers, mat or textile is washed to remove any<br><br>
-51-<br>
[0190] In one embodiment, bio-active functional monomers are included in the<br>
fluoro-polymer synthesis and impart mold resistance, such as anti-microbial and/or biocidal<br>
properties. Alternatively, crosslinking of a bio-active functional polymer, co-polymer or<br>
oligomer is achieved by including the bio-active component during application of a metal<br>
salt and/or free radical initiators. In another embodiment, both bio-active functionality and<br>
water and oil repellency are imparted in the same process.<br>
[0191] In another embodiment, bio-active functional monomers, oligomers, co-<br>
polymers or polymers are polymerized (or further polymerized or crosslinked) in situ<br>
around fibrous or particulate surfaces. In one example, another reactive polymer and/or a<br>
crosslinking agent is mixed together with the bio-active functional component, binding the<br>
bio-active functional component to the fibrous surface. In an alternative example, the bio-<br>
active functional components are functional groups on monomers, oligomers, co-polymers<br>
and polymers, which are capable of binding to particulate and fibrous surfaces. For<br>
example, the monomers, oligomers, co-polymers and polymers bind to functional groups<br>
that are bound to the fibrous or particulate surface. Some examples of bio-active<br>
functional monomers, oligomers, co-polymers and polymers include, but are not limited to,<br>
quarternized amine functional groups, for example, having from 4 to 10 carbons in the alkyl<br>
chain. In one specific example, the fungicidal and bactericidal properties have been shown<br>
to kill mold after the mold contacts a bio-active coating on the surface of a textile.<br>
[0192] In one embodiment, fibers are first treated to provide a desired functional<br>
group on the surface of the fiber. Then, the fibers are incorporated into a mat or textile.<br>
For example, the fibers may be woven into a fabric or otherwise incorporated into the form<br>
of a mat or paper. The fibers may be combined with fibers having no coating or having a<br>
coating incorporating a different functional group, providing the paper, mat or fabric with<br>
mold resistance and/or other desirable properties, based on the properties of treated fibrous<br>
surfaces.<br>
[0193] In one embodiment, a facing paper is treated on one surface to impart<br>
mold resistance and water repellency. The opposite surface is untreated or is treated in<br>
such a way as to provide the opposite surface excellent adhesion with a slurry that forms a<br>
wallboard core. Alternatively, the facing paper may be made of multiple plies. For<br>
example, an outer ply may be treated to provide bio-active and water repellency to a<br><br>
-52-<br>
wallboard, while the innermost ply may be treated to adhere to the core of the wallboard.<br>
In another example, the outer ply may be treated for water repellency and one or more<br>
inner plies may be treated to impart bio-active properties. In yet another embodiment, the<br>
outermost ply on an exposed surface is treated to prepare the surface for plastering, stucco,<br>
painting, tarring or decorative papering. For example, the outermost ply may be treated to<br>
provide a self-stick surface for a later-applied, decorative wallpaper.<br>
[0194] In one embodiment, a film forming polymer or mixture of polymers, at<br>
least one of which is an at least partially water-soluble or water-swellable strength enhancer<br>
is used as a sizing for fibers or is applied to a mat or a fabric. The composition may<br>
optionally include a bio-active component and/or a fire retardant to increase fire-resistance.<br>
The polymer is preferably cross-linked or treated to prevent complete dissolution of the<br>
polymer and subsequent migration away from the fiber during addition to water and<br>
subsequent drying. For example, a water-soluble, film-forming polymer utilized in a sizing<br>
composition preferably has a strong interaction with the cementitious matrix. Preferred<br>
strength enhancing, film forming polymers of the invention include, but are not limited in<br>
any way, to carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) for Portland cement compositions and high<br>
molecular weight cellulose ethers other than CMC or high molecular weight polyvinyl<br>
pyrrolidone (PVP) together with an appropriate cross-linker such as high molecular weight<br>
polystyrene sulfonate (PSS) for gypsum compositions. Fibers may be of any denier and<br>
length, ranging from continuous, bundled strands, such as those often used in woven<br>
meshes, to relatively short, monofilament fibers, such as those used for discrete fiber<br>
reinforcement and in some non-woven mats. Herein denier is used as a measure of the fiber<br>
mass per unit length in milli-grams per inch (mg/inch), which is an indirect measure of the<br>
fiber cross section. Alternatively, a polymer composition may be used as a binder in non-<br>
woven fibrous mats, the mats being used for reinforcing composite cementitious materials.<br>
[0195] Reinforced composite cementitious materials may be used as, for<br>
example, fiber-reinforced cement for cast products, fiber-reinforced gypsum, such as glass-<br>
fiber-reinforced gypsum (GFG), cement boards, and patching and joint compounds. In one<br>
embodiment glass-fiber-reinforced concrete (GFRC) is prepared having glass fibers treated<br>
by a CMC. Also, fabrics and paper are used with cement as a reinforcement, such as in<br>
joint tapes, patching kits, and molded articles. The fibers and fabrics, themselves, can be<br><br>
-53-<br>
made by any conventional process or may be specifically designed with functional groups<br>
on the fibrous surfaces that react with the polymer additives or sizing. In one embodiment,<br>
conventional sizing equipment is configured to apply the polymer additive and to dry and<br>
crosslink the polymers. In one embodiment, the treated fibers are incorporated into the<br>
composites according to conventional methods by merely replacing existing fiber or fabric<br>
inclusions.<br>
[0196] It is thought, without being limiting in any way, that in one embodiment a<br>
polymer coating forms an interfacial layer of polymer-enriched slurry adjacent to the fiber.<br>
As the set cement dries, the polymer re-forms a firm encapsulating the fiber and local<br>
cement matrix surrounding it. The polymer binds the fiber to the matrix and reinforces the<br>
region surrounding the fiber. This results in an effective transfer of stress between the<br>
cement matrix, reinforcing polymer film, and reinforcing fiber when the composite is<br>
stressed. In this embodiment, sizing compositions usually have between 2% and 20%<br>
solids content and add-on 3% to 25% size to the original fiber or fabric weight. Strength<br>
enhancement in sized-fiber-reinforced composites increases with higher amounts of<br>
polymer add-on.<br>
[0197] A fiber sizing may be selected from one of a starch, an acrylic polymers<br>
(commonly polymerized from an acrylic acid, an acrylic salt, an acrylic ester, an acrylamide,<br>
a methacrylic acid, or an acrylonitrile monomer), a polyvinyl acetate, an alginate, and a<br>
natural gum. Also, emulsions or dispersions of polyesters, polyurethanes, and styrene<br>
copolymers may be used. Wallboard reinforced by fibers coated solely with these<br>
formulations may show some improvement in mechanical strength if the treated fibers are<br>
mixed into the slurry gently, as a final step. Also, excess water content must be minimized<br>
and drying carried out quickly, as low molecular weight and non-crosslinked additives<br>
dissolve in the water and tend to migrate away from the fibers and toward the surface of<br>
the wallboard over time during drying. Also, without further treatment these additives<br>
often segregate to the surface and serve as nutrients for undesirable microbial, mold and<br>
fungus growth. Iodine staining techniques were used to observe this propensity for<br>
migration, for example, among latex additives. Preferably, the sizing polymer has a strong<br>
interaction and bond with the hardening cement without retarding the set and is selected to<br>
be compatible with a cellulose ether additive dispersed throughout the matrix phase.<br><br>
-54-<br>
[0198] The preferred polymer for enhancing the strength of a cementitious<br>
composite depends on the type of cement to be reinforced and the type of fiber or particles<br>
to be used as reinforcements. Carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) improves the dried strength<br>
of Portland cement. However, CMC degrades the mechanical strength of gypsum products.<br>
It is thought, without being limiting in any way, that the chelating effect of the carboxyl<br>
groups on the growing gypsum crystal surface retards the set, which is at least partially<br>
responsible for decreasing the strength of the gypsum matrix.<br>
[0199] Other cellulose ethers improve the strength of gypsum. Also, the degree<br>
of improvement tends to increase with increasing molecular weight and decreasing degree<br>
of substitution of the cellulose ether, at least for additions of less than 6 wt% of cellulose<br>
ether to calcium sulfate hemihydrate. For example, high molecular weight hydroxyefhyl<br>
methyl cellulose (HEMC), hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose (HPMC), and methyl cellulose<br>
(MC) enhance the strength of gypsum composites while their low molecular weight<br>
counterparts have little strengthening effect or may actually decrease composite strength.<br>
[0200] It is thought, without being limiting in any way, that the hydrogen<br>
bonding of cellulose ethers and the ionic crosslinking, such as that of PVP and PSS, result<br>
in strong adhesion to the cement matrix. Cohesive forces retain the surface treatment on<br>
the surface of the fibers during mixing, setting and drying of the composite slurry.<br>
Preferably, the surface treatment is somewhat soluble or swellable in water, resulting in an<br>
interfacial layer of polymer that adheres to the fiber and partially penetrates the crystallized<br>
particles or cement or gypsum.<br>
[0201] Preferably, high molecular weight sizing has lower solids content than<br>
conventional sizes; however, the add-on is comparable, because the molecules of the high<br>
molecular weight sizing are larger. Furthermore, cross-linking the surface coating creates a<br>
durable coating for fibers or fabrics that is not easily removed during the mixing, setting, or<br>
drying steps of fiber-cement production. Hydrophilic polymer systems are converted to<br>
swellable hydrogels upon cross-linking. It is believed, without being limiting in any way,<br>
that these swollen coatings allow cement crystal growth into fiber size while resisting<br>
erosion, dissolution, and migration. Fibers with cross-linked surface coatings are used in<br>
conventional high-speed mixing procedures such as those found in wallboard production.<br>
In one embodiment, the fibers are pre-mixed with dry components of the cement.<br><br>
-55-<br>
Alternatively, the fibers are dispersed in water prior to cement mixing or are combined<br>
together with both the water and cement and/or calcium sulfate hemihydrate.<br>
[0202] Several cross-linking methods are utilized to decrease the solubility of<br>
surface coatings. In one embodiment, a sizing is at least partially insolubilized by exposing<br>
the sizing to higher temperatures than normal during drying, causing crosslinking of the<br>
sizing. Sizing components such as starch and starch derivatives, PVA, CMC, and acrylate<br>
polymers, as previously listed above, crosslink at elevated temperatures. Conventional<br>
sizing avoids such temperatures to prevent the sizing from becoming insoluble, for<br>
example. In another embodiment, radiation, such as ultra-violet (UV) light or gamma rays,<br>
can also be used to cross-link some sizing components, such as PVP. In another<br>
embodiment, water-insoluble polymers are incorporated into a film forming polymer to<br>
physically cross-link the surface treatment. For example, a reactive polymer system, a<br>
system of reactive pre-polymers, or a latex, preferably with an internal cross-linker, may be<br>
mixed with hydrophilic polymers and reacted to lower the solubility of the resulting filrn on<br>
the additive.<br>
[0203] In an alternative embodiment, a film forming polymer is chemically cross-<br>
linked to form a hydrogel. For example, cross-linking agents for cellulose ethers include<br>
organic titanates, organic zirconates, and dialdehydes, such as glyoxal and gluturaldehyde.<br>
Borax and sodium trimetaphosphate for preferred for starches, and calcium chloride with<br>
peroxide, PSS and UV light are preferred for PVP. In one preferred embodiment, the<br>
cross-linking system is relatively stable and is preferably enhanced during or after drying by<br>
the elevated temperature, which allows swelling during setting but avoids migration of the<br>
polymer during drying and weakening of the bond if a cementitious building material<br>
becomes wet, for example, by flooding or exposure to high humidity.<br>
[0204] In one embodiment, HPMC is crosslinked by a chelated organic titanate<br>
which is activated at temperatures above 100 degrees centigrade. In another embodiment, a<br>
cross-linking agent is applied to only the outermost region of the surface coating, forming a<br>
surface cross-linked polymer coating with delayed solubility. In another preferred<br>
embodiment, a surface coating polymerizes in situ on a fiber in combination with a<br>
crosslinking agent. For example, the free radical polymerization of 1-vinyl 2-pyrrolidone<br><br>
-56-<br>
with 1,6-hexanediol diacrylate is used to form a surface coating on a fiber for use in<br>
cementitious composite materials.<br>
[0205] In another embodiment, a coupling agent, such as a silane coupling<br>
agent, is included with the surface coating formulation to improve the bond between the<br>
size and the fiber, promoting adhesion. Alternatively, the coupling agent is applied to the<br>
fibers or fabric as a primer before application of the surface treatment. In a preferred<br>
embodiment, a cross-linking agent, such as an organic titanate, act as both the crosslinking<br>
agent and the coupling agent, chemically bonding the surface treatment to the fiber, for<br>
example, via hydroxyl functional groups of the fibrous surface of a fabric. In one<br>
embodiment, the layer of the surface treatment adjacent to the fibrous surface is cross-<br>
linked by the coupling/crosslinking agent, but the exterior of the surface treatment is either<br>
not cross-linked or is less highly cross-linked than the surface treatment adjacent to the<br>
fibrous surface.<br>
[0206] Preferred fibers to be sized with the inventive composition include<br>
mono filament, bundled, and spun strands of various materials, including inorganic fibers,<br>
such as glass, mineral wool, and steel, synthetic fibers, such as polypropylene, polyester,<br>
and nylon, and natural fibers, such as cotton, hemp, and wood fibers. In one embodiment,<br>
bundled and chopped spun strands are designed to separate when mixed with the slurry,<br>
allowing the treated fibers to be embedded the matrix material. In an alternative preferred<br>
embodiment, the sizing composition and slurry mixing conditions are controlled to maintain<br>
an intact surface coating around a fiber bundle or strand, while allowing for some<br>
separation of the individual fibers. This provides a larger effective surface area of the fibers<br>
for adhesion to the size and cement matrix. The surface coating acts as a binder, allowing<br>
discrete bundles or spun strands of fibers that would normally separate into individual<br>
filaments when mixed in a slurry.<br>
[0207] In one embodiment, the fiber is immersed in the surface coating material,<br>
dried, woven if desired, and cut to the desired dimensions in an automated process. For<br>
example, bundled fiberglass strands sized with a cross-linking CMC composition may be<br>
woven or arranged into a mesh and embedded as reinforcement in cement boards. In an<br>
alternative embodiment, chopped or other types of discrete fibers are sized by spraying<br>
them with a sizing solution while they are suspended in air. In yet another embodiment,<br><br><br>
-57-<br>
individual fibers are coated by a surface coating in a solvent or emulsion and are<br>
agglomerated into a mat of fibers. Each of the coating processes may be repeated any<br>
number of times to achieve a desired thickness of add-on.<br>
[0208] In one preferred embodiment, a fiber or fibers is coated by a cellulose<br>
ether at an elevated temperature, at which the cellulose either particles have low solubility.<br>
Powdered CE s are dispersed in hot water without hydrating or dissolving them,<br>
maintaining a low viscosity even at high concentrations of CE s. As the solution cools, as<br>
when exposed to a cool fiber or fabric or to air, the CE hydrates, forming a semi-solid gel.<br>
In an alternative embodiment, a surface-treated, delayed-solubility CE is used. Preferably,<br>
the surface-treated, delayed-solubility cellulose ether is coated with an aldehyde, more<br>
preferably a gluturaldehyde. For example, fiber immersion sizing (single or double) with a<br>
high molecular weight, low DS cellulose ether may achieve an add-on weight of greater<br>
than 25%. More preferably, the add-on weight is limited to a range of 5-15% by adjusting<br>
the solids content of the solution, which provides substantial improvement in the pull-out<br>
strength of the fibers without using excess cellulose ether, reducing cost.<br>
[0209] In one embodiment, fabrics or papers are sized by immersing the fabric or<br>
paper sheet in the surface treatment. In another embodiment, a surface treatment is<br>
sprayed onto one or both sides a fabric or paper layer.<br>
[0210] In one embodiment, a fiber mat is formed by evenly dispersing chopped<br>
fibers in solution for surface treating the fibers. Then, the fibers are evenly spread, and the<br>
dispersion is drained over a wire mesh. Next, the fiber mat is dried, or, alternatively, the<br>
mat is first compressed to force liquid out of the mesh. For example, the fibers may be<br>
glass fibers, the surface coating may be PVP, and/or the PVP may be crosslinked by PSS or<br>
UV light before or after the mat is dried. In an alternative embodiment, pressure or vacuum<br>
is applied before the wet fiber mat is dried, degassing the fibers and improving penetration<br>
of the surface coating.<br>
[0211] In one preferred embodiment, intermingling of the polymer and the<br>
cement or gypsum crystals in the matrix is increased by incorporating inorganic particles in<br>
the sizing formulation. For example, the inorganic particles, such as accelerant, act as<br>
seeds for the precipitation of cement crystals, causing cement crystals to grow directly from<br><br>
-58-<br>
are one of ground cement and limestone in cement compositions, and ground gypsum ball<br>
mill accelerator for gypsum compositions.<br>
[0212] In an additional embodiment, the surface coatings are used to coat other<br>
types and forms of materials in addition to fibers. For example, reinforcing polymer<br>
coatings can be used to coat reinforcing aggregate, lightweight filler and wire mesh. Also,<br>
the surface coating may be added primarily for its bio-active properties, rather than<br>
primarily as a strengthening agent, or as a multi-functional coating.<br>
[0213] Fig. 36 shows a sketch of one embodiment of the invention showing a<br>
textile coated with a bio-active polymer. In contrast to the conventional textile, as shown<br>
in Fig. 37, the textile in Fig. 1 has a thin layer of the bio-active polymer on the fibrous<br>
surfaces of the textile. Figs. 38A and 38B show a sketch of the results of an experiment<br>
that exposed both of the surfaces to the same mold-containing emulsion, which was then<br>
encouraged to grow by placing both of the samples in a warm, humid environment. After a<br>
short period of time, the untreated textile, for example as sketched in Fig. 38B, showed<br>
abundant evidence of mold growth. In contrast, the sample having fibers coated with the<br>
bio-active polymer showed little or no mold growth.<br>
SPECIFIC EXAMPLES<br>
[0214] Control Sample. One hundred grams of β-calcium sulfate hemihydrate<br>
was dry mixed with 0.13g ground gypsum accelerator. The β-calcium sulfate hemihydrate<br>
was then added to 150 g of room-temperature tap water in a 500 mL Waring blender. The<br>
slurry was blended at low speed for 15 seconds. The slurry was then immediately poured<br>
into an approximately 7" x 2" x 1/2" mold. After about 20 minutes, the sample was removed<br>
from the mold and placed in a convection oven at 45 °C in which it was dried for at least<br>
36 hrs. After removal from the oven, the sample was cut to 5" x 2" and massed and<br>

Chemical Co.). The dry mixture was then added to 150 g of tap water in a 500 mL Waring<br>
blender. The slurry was blended at low speed for 15 seconds. The slurry was then<br>
immediately poured into a 7" x 2" x 14" mold and, after 20 minutes, removed. The sample<br>
was placed in a convection oven at 45 °C for at least 36 hrs. After removal from the oven,<br>
the sample was cut to 5" long, massed, and dimensioned. The density was calculated and<br>
the sample was tested for flexural strength and nail pull resistance on an Instron mechanical<br>
testing system. The resulting sample had a density of 0.63 g/cc, a flexural strength of 545<br>
psi, and a nail pull resistance of 78 lbs.<br>
[0217] High Viscosity HPMC Enhancing Agent; Lightweight Wallboard. A<br>
papered sample was prepared by mixing 1 kg of P-calcium sulfate hemihydrate with 1.3 g<br>
ground gypsum and 10 g of HPMC (22 kcps, purchased from Aldrich Chemical Co.). To a<br>
5 liter Waring blending container was added 1.5 kg of room-temperature tap water, 20<br>
drops of Daxad 19LKN (dispersant) from Dow, and 10 drops of a 40% solution of<br>
diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid sodium salt (retarder). The powder was added to the<br><br>
-60-<br>
water and blended on high for 15 seconds. The shiny was then poured into an<br>
approximately 12" x 12" x 1/2" mold lined with an envelope made of standard decorative<br>
wallboard facing paper. The sample was removed from the mold after 15 minutes and<br>
placed in a 45°C convection oven for 48 hrs. The sample was then removed and cut into<br>
5" x 2" and 9" x 2" specimens, with the long dimension in the direction of the fibers of the<br>
paper. These specimens were then massed and measured. The density was calculated and<br>
the specimens were tested for flexural strength in the fiber direction and nail pull resistance<br>
on an Instron mechanical testing system. The sample had a density of 0.47 g/cc, a flexural<br>
strength of 822 psi, and a nail pull resistance of 75 lbs.<br>
[0218] MC with 1:1 ratio of water: β-calcium sulfate hemihvdrate ratio by<br>
weight. First, 100 parts of β-calcium sulfate hemihydrate was mixed with 9 parts of methyl<br>
cellulose (Aldrich, MW 17,000, viscosity grade 25 cps). The mixture was then added to<br>
100 parts of water at room temperature and blended at a high shear setting for<br>
approximately 15 seconds. The resulting slurry was highly viscous, failing to pour into the<br>
form. A spatula was used to transfer, in small portions, enough slurry to be pressed into a<br>
form measuring 2 inches by 5 inches by 0.5 inches. After setting, the mixture was removed<br>
from the mold and cured at 45 degrees centigrade for 2 days. The resulting sample has a<br>
density of 0.72 g/cc, a nail pull index of 1.87 (121 lbs.) and flexural strength of 881 lb/in2.<br>
[0219] MC with 1:1 ratio of water: β-calcium sulfate hemihydrate ratio by<br>
weight. First, 100 parts of β-calcium sulfate hemihydrate was mixed with 9 parts of methyl<br>
cellulose (Aldrich, MW 14,000, viscosity grade 15 cps). The mixture was then added to<br>
100 parts of water and blended at high shear setting for approximately 15 seconds. The<br>
resulting slurry was highly viscous, failing to pour into the form. A spatula was used to<br>
transfer, in small portions, enough slurry to be pressed into a form measuring 2 inches by 5<br>
inches by 0.5 inches. After setting, the mixture was removed from the mold and cured at<br>
45 degrees centigrade for 2 days. The resulting sample had a density of 0.74 g/cc, a nail<br>
pull index of 1.75 (119 lbs.) and flexural strength of 864 Ib/in2.<br>
[0220] MC with 1:1 ratio of water: β-calcium sulfate hemihvdrate ratio by<br>
weight. First, 100 parts of β-calcium sulfate hemihydrate was mixed with 9 parts of methyl<br>
cellulose (Aldrich, MW 40,000, viscosity grade 400 cps). The mixture was then added to<br>
100 parts of water and blended at a high shear setting. The viscosity was exceedingly high<br><br>
-61-<br>
and mixing was not possible for the desired 15 second duration. The powdered mixture<br>
was not fully incorporated into the slurry. The mixture prematurely set and could not be<br>
transferred to a form.<br>
[0221] MC with 1:1 ratio of water:β-calcium sulfate hemihvdrate ratio by<br>
weight. A subsequent specimen was prepared by reducing the amount of methyl cellulose<br>
by mixing 100 parts of β-calcium sulfate hemihydrate with 5 parts methyl cellulose instead<br>
of 9 parts methyl cellulose. The mixture was then added to 100 parts of water and blended<br>
at high shear setting for approximately 15 seconds. The resulting slurry was extremely<br>
viscous, beginning to set prematurely during mixing and failing to pour into the form. A<br>
spatula was used to transfer, in small portions, enough slurry to be pressed into a forni<br>
measuring 2 inches by 5 inches by 0.5 inches. After setting, the mixture was removed from<br>
the mold and cured at 45 degrees centigrade for 2 days. The resulting sample had a density<br>
of 0.73 g/cc, a nail pull index of 1.54 (103 lbs.) and a flexural strength of 766 lbs./in2.<br>
[0222] Low Viscosity Grade HPMC. A ratio of 1:1 of water:β-calcium sulfate<br>
hemihydrate ratio by weight was prepared. First, 100 parts of β-calcium sulfate<br>
hemihydrate was mixed with 9 parts of HPMC (Aldrich, MW 10,000, viscosity grade 5<br>
cps). The mixture was then added to 100 parts of water and blended at high shear setting<br>
for approximately 15 seconds. The resulting slurry poured directly into a form measuring 2<br>
inches by 5 inches by 0.5 inches. After setting, the mixture was removed from the mold<br>
and cured at 45 degrees centigrade for 2 days. The resulting sample had a density of 0.63<br>
g/cc, a nail pull index of 1.26 (58 lbs.) and a flexural strength of 675 lb/in2.<br>
[0223] Low Viscosity Grade HPMC. A ratio of 1:1 of water:β-calcium sulfate<br>
hemihydrate ratio by weight was prepared. First, 100 parts of β-calcium sulfate<br>
hemihydrate was mixed with 9 parts of HPMC (Aldrich, MW 10,000, viscosity grade 6<br>
cps). The mixture was then added to 100 parts of water and blended at high shear setting<br>
for approximately 15 seconds. The resulting slurry poured directly into a form measuring 2<br>
inches by 5 inches by 0.5 inches. After setting, the mixture was removed from the mold<br>
and cured at 45 degrees centigrade for 2 days. The resulting sample had a density of 0.59<br>
g/cc, a nail pull index of 1.18 (47 lbs.) and a flexural strength of 535 lb/in2.<br>
[0224] Moderate Range Viscosity Grade HPMC. A water:β-calcium sulfate<br><br>
-62-<br>
hemihydrate was mixed with 9 parts of HPMC (Aldrich, MW 12,000, viscosity grade 80-<br>
120 cps). The mixture was then added to 100 parts of water and blended at high shear<br>
setting for approximately 15 seconds. The resulting slurry was exceedingly viscous,<br>
prematurely setting during mixing and failing to pour into the form. A spatula was used to<br>
transfer, in small portions, enough slurry to fill a form measuring 2 inches by 5 inches by<br>
0.5 inches. After setting, the mixture was removed from the mold and cured at 45 degrees<br>
centigrade for 2 days. The resulting sample had a density of 0.75 g/cc, a nail pull index of<br>
1.54 (121 lbs.) and a flexural strength of 652 lb/in2.<br>
[0225] High viscosity, surface-treated HEMC. A paperless sample was<br>
prepared by mixing 1.3 kg of β-calcium sulfate hemihydrate with 1.69 g ball mill ground<br>
gypsum (accelerator) and 26 g of retarded HEMC (viscosity grade of 15-20.5 kcps at 2<br>
wt%, purchased from Aldrich Chemical Co.). The liquid components, 1.68 kg room<br>
temperature tap water, 26 drops Daxad 19LKN (dispersant) from Dow, and 13 drops 40%<br>
solution of diethylenetriaminepentacetic acid sodium salt (retarder), were added to a 5 liter<br>
Waring blender. The dry ingredients were added to the water and blended on high for 15<br>
seconds, forming a slurry. The slurry was then poured into an approximately 12" x 12" x<br>
1/2" glass mold with a thin teflon sheet on one face to facilitate removal. The sample was<br>
removed from the mold after 15 minutes and placed in a 45 degrees centigrade convection<br>
oven for 48 hrs. The sample was then removed and cut into 5" x 2" specimens. These<br>
specimens were then weighed and measured. The densities of nine specimens were<br>
calculated and the specimens were tested for flexural strength and nail pull resistance on an<br>
Instron Mechanical testing system using the methods previously described. The board had<br>
an average density of 0.64 g/cc, a flexural strength of 809 psi, and a nail pull resistance of<br>
102 lbs., passing ASTM flexural strength and nail pull requirements.<br>
[0226] Ultra-Lightweight Wallboard/Insulation Board. An ultra-lightweight<br>
wallboard cone was prepared by adding, to a 500 mL blending container, 200 mL of room<br>
temperature tap water. 40 g calcium sulfate hemi-hydrate (stucco) was dry mixed together<br>
with 20 g of a high viscosity, surface-treated (delayed solubility) HPMC, 0.8 g of trisodium<br>
trimetaphosphate, and 0.4 g of ground gypsum ball mill accelerator. The dry mixture was<br>
added to the water and the slurry was blended at low speed for 30 seconds. The slurry was<br>
deposited in an envelope of standard, decorative drvwall paper in a 7" x 2" x 0.5" mold.<br><br>
-63-<br>
The sample was dried at 45 oC for 48 hours. The sample was then cut, dimensioned,<br>
massed and mechanically tested. The resulting board had a density of only 0.33 g/cc (850<br>
lbs/MSF) and an average nail pull resistance of 118 lbs.<br>
[0227] Ultra- Lightweight Wallboard/ Insulation Board. An ultra-lightweight<br>
wallboard cone was prepared by adding, to a 500 mL blending container, 200 mL of room<br>
temperature tap water. 65g of beta-calcium sulfate-hemi-hydrate (stucco) was dry mixed<br>
together with 6.5 g of a high viscosity, surface-treated (delayed solubility) HPMC, 0.006G<br>
of trisodium trimetaphosphate, 3.3 g of 1" chopped strand glass fibers and 0.06 g of<br>
f\ground gypsum ball mill accelerator. The dry mixture was added to the water and the<br>
slurry was blended at a low speed for 30 seconds. The slurry was then deposited in an<br>
envelope of standard, decorative drywall paper in a 7" x 2" x 0.5" mold. The sample was<br>
dried at 45 o C for 48 hours. The sample was then cut, dimensioned, massed and<br>
mechanically tested. The resulting board had a density of 0.34 g/cc (8801bs/MSF) and an<br>
average nail pull resistance of only 84 lbs.<br>
[0228] High viscosity, surface-treated HEMC. A paperless sample was<br>
prepared by mixing 100 g of β-calcium sulfate hemihydrate with 0.13 g ball mill ground<br>
gypsum (accelerator) and 1 g of retarded HEMC (viscosity grade of 15-20.5 kcps at 2<br>
wt%, purchased from Aldrich Chemical Co.). The mixture was then added to 150 g of<br>
water and blended on high for 15 seconds, forming a slurry. The slurry was then poured<br>
into an approximately 7" x 2" x 1/2" mold. The sample was removed from the mold after 15<br>
minutes and placed in a 45 degrees centigrade convection oven for 48 hrs. The sample was<br>
then removed and cut to 5" x 2". The density of sample was calculated and it was tested<br>
for flexural strength and nail pull resistance on an Instron mechanical testing system using<br>
the methods previously described. The wallboard specimen had an average density of 0.63<br>
g/cc, a flexural strength of 545 psi, and a nail pull resistance of 78 lbs., passing the ASTM<br>
nail pull requirement.<br>
[0229] High-viscosity, surface-treated HEMC. A paperless wallboard is<br>
prepared using the following procedure. First, 150 g of β-calcium sulfate hemihydrate is<br>
dry mixed with 0.2 g ground gypsum and 3 g of surface-treated (retarded dissolution)<br>
HEMC (15-20.5 kcps, purchased from Aldrich Chemical Co.). The dry ingredients are<br>
added to 162 g of tap water in a 500mL Waring blender forming a slurry. The slurry is<br><br>
-64-<br>
blended at low speed for 15 seconds. The slurry is then immediately poured into a 7" x 2"<br>
x 1/2" mold and, after 20 minutes, removed. The wallboard specimen is placed in a<br>
convection oven at 45 degrees centigrade for at least 36 hrs for drying. After removal from<br>
the oven, the sample is trimmed to 5" long, weighed and dimensioned. A specimen<br>
prepared according to this procedure had a density of 0.80 g/cc, a flexural strength of 975<br>
psi, and a nail pull resistance of 180 lbs., exceeding ASTM standards for flexural strength<br>
and nail pull resistance for 1/2-inch wallboard.<br>
[0230] High viscosity, surface-treated HEMC. A paperless wallboard is<br>
prepared using the following procedure. First, 150 grams of β-calcium sulfate hemihydrate<br>
is dry mixed with 0.2 g ground gypsum and 3 g of surface-treated HEMC (15-20.5 kcps,<br>
purchased from Aldrich Chemical Co.). The dry ingredients are then added to 150 g of tap<br>
water in a 500mL Waring blender, forming a slurry. The slurry is blended at low speed for<br>
15 seconds. The slurry is then immediately poured into a 7" x 2" x 1/2" mold and, after 20<br>
minutes, removed. The wallboard specimen is placed in a convection oven at 45 degrees<br>
centigrade for at least 36 hrs for drying. After removal from the oven, the specimen is cut<br>
to 5" long, weighed and dimensioned. A specimen prepared according to the foregoing<br>
procedure had a density of 0. 85 g/cc, a flexural strength of 989 psi, and a nail pull<br>
resistance of 203 lbs., exceeding the ASTM standards for flexural strength and nail pull<br>
resistance for 1/2-inch wallboard.<br>
[0231] Ouarternization of Poly(vinylpyridine). An amount of 6 g of poly(4-<br>
vinylpyridine) MW 160,000 was dissolved in 80 g of nitromethane. The temperature of the<br>
solution was brought to 96° C. An amount of 10 g of hexyl bromide was added dropwise<br>
to the solution which was then left to stir for 4 hr. During the mixing, the color of the<br>
yellow solution became darker. After 4 hr, the solution was precipitated in 400 mL of<br>
toluene. The fibrous solid was filtered and washed with 100 mL of acetone. The<br>
quaternized polymer was dried in an oven at 180° C for 30 minutes.<br>
[0232] Use of Quartenized Poly(vinylpyridine). An amount of 100 parts of β-<br>
calcium sulfate hemihydrate was mixed with 0.5 parts of quaternized poly(vinylpyridine),<br>
0.13 parts accelerator and 0.2 parts of dispersant. The mixture was then added to 150<br>
parts of water containing a small percentage of retarder and blended at a high shear setting<br>
for approximately 20 seconds. The resulting slurry was poured directly from the laboratory<br><br>
-65-<br>
blender to a mold measuring 12 in x 14 in x 0.5 in. After setting, the sample was removed<br>
from the mold and cured at 45 oC for 2 days.<br>
[0233] Poly(vinylpyridine) Bio-Active Coating. A fibrous polyester material<br>
was coated with an anti-fungal polymer layer. A solution was made of the following: 6 g of<br>
4-vinylpyridine, 0.12 g of divinylbenzene, 0.12 g of benzoyl peroxide, and 6 g of methanol.<br>
One each of a 2" x 2" polyester pad and a glass mat were dipped in the solution and then<br>
were exposed to ultraviolet light for about 3 hours (plus or minus 10 minutes). Then, the<br>
pad and mat were immersed in a solution of 10 milli-liters of nitromethane/hexyl bromide<br>
(10:1, vol/vol) and placed in an oven at 80o C for 4 h. After heating, the pad and mat were<br>
cooled to room temperature.<br>
[0234] A mold solution was prepared. Two Petri dishes of potato dextrose agar<br>
were stored in a humid environment. After 3 days, a dense layer of mold was evident. In a<br>
1000 mL flask, 10 g of potato dextrose starch was added to 500 mL of water. The mixture<br>
was heated with stirring until the starch dissolved and was then cooled to room<br>
temperature. Two drops of Triton-X was added. The moldy agar from the two Petri<br>
dishes was then added and the mixture was stirred for 30 min. The mixture was filtered<br>
and the dark green filtrate was collected in a spray bottle. For comparison, samples of an<br>
untreated polyester material and glass mat and the treated polyester pad and glass mat were<br>
each sprayed twice with the mold solution. The samples were then stored in a humidity<br>
chamber at 37 degrees C and 90 % humidity. After 5 days, both the untreated glass mat<br>
and the untreated polyester material exhibited mold growth while the bio-active, anti-fungal<br>
coated samples were free from mold growth. The samples we're observed for a period of<br>
five weeks during which no mold growth was observed on the treated samples.<br>
[0235] Gluturaldehyde Bio-Active Coating. In another example, both glyoxal<br>
treated hydroxyethyl methyl cellulose, a cellulose ether, and gluturaldehyde treated<br>
hydroxyethyl methyl cellulose were prepared by mixing an aqueous solution of the<br>
dialdehyde (e.g. 50 wt% gluturaldehyde or 40 wt% glyoxal) dropwise to a mixture of 1<br>
gram of the cellulose ether in 20 milli-liters of acetone, until 1 gram of the dialdheyde<br>
aqueous solution was added. The mixture was stirred at ambient temperature for one-half<br>
hour and the treated cellulose ether was dried in an oven at 60 degrees centigrade until the<br>
acetone evaporated. Then, the treated cellulose ether was mixed at a ratio of 1:100 to<br><br>
-66-<br>
water heated to 90 degrees centigrade. After the cellulose ether dispersed in the water, the<br>
temperature was reduced to ambient temperature to complete the dissolution of the<br>
cellulose ether. Solubility of the cellulose ether increases with decreasing temperature<br>
within this temperature range. Samples of each of the cellulose ethers were poured into<br>
petri dishes, which were exposed to mold in a warm, most environment (32 degrees<br>
centigrade; 89% humidity). The glyoxal treated cellulose ethers grew mold, but the<br>
gluturaldehyde treated cellulose ethers did not grow mold. For example, after the first<br>
week the glyoxal treated cellulose ethers showed 15-60% coverage of mold on the surface<br>
of the samples, whereas the gluturaldehyde remained free of mold. At five weeks, the<br>
glyoxal samples had between 50-70% mold coverage, whereas the gluturaldehyde remained<br>
mold free. In comparison, untreated hydroxyethyl methyl cellulose had 30-50% mold<br>
coverage after 5 weeks.<br>
[0236] Glass Fiber Gypsum, No Surface Modifier. As a comparative example,<br>
strands of fiber were removed from a sheet of woven type E fiberglass boat cloth. The<br>
strands were cut into 4" sections and individually massed to determine fiber denier. The<br>
specimens were then embedded in the center of a 9" x 1" x 1/2" gypsum block. The fibers<br>
were oriented parallel to the 1/2" direction with approximately one inch spacing between<br>
each fiber. The mold was constructed with the fibers suspended between two sets of<br>
clamped 14" zinc bars with two 1/2" plastic spacers. Three inches of fiber were left exposed<br>
from the gypsum block on one side for clamping to the testing apparatus.<br>
[0237] One hundred grams of beta calcium sulfate hemi-hydrate stucco was<br>
mixed with 0.13 g of ground gypsum ball mill accelerator. This powder was added to 150<br>
g tap water and mixed in a Waring blender at low speed for 15 seconds. The slurry was<br>
then poured into the mold around the suspended fibers. The block was removed from the<br>
mold after 20 minutes of setting and dried in a convection oven at 45 C for 24 hours.<br>
[0238] After drying, the block was massed to determine matrix density. The<br>
pull-out characteristics of each fiber were tested using an Instron mechanical testing<br>
machine at a displacement rate of one inch per minute.<br>
[0239] The gypsum density was 0.62 g/cc, the average fiber denier was 3.5 mg<br>
per inch, and the average pull-out strength was 2.62 lbs with a standard deviation of less<br><br>
-67-<br>
[0240] Glass Fiber Gypsum, Polyurethane Latex Surface Modifier. As another<br>
comparative example, a commercially available polyurethane latex emulsion with an internal<br>
cross-linker was used as a sizing composition. The surface-modifier was applied at room<br>
temperature to strands removed from a sheet of woven type E fiberglass boat cloth. The<br>
surface-modifier was applied by winding the strands onto a small roller, submerging the<br>
roller in the sizing composition, and unwinding the strands through the composition. The<br>
fiber strands were then weighted with a small clip on one end to prevent warping and hung<br>
to dry in a 45 C convection oven for 30 minutes. The dried fibers were cut to 4" sections,<br>
massed, and embedded in a gypsum block, and the pull-out strength was tested following<br>
the procedure from the Glass Fiber Gypsum. No Size example. The results were recorded<br>
and compared to determine the amount of surface-modifier add-on and pull-out strength<br>
improvement from control fibers in the same matrix. Pullout strength improvement<br>
indicates the increase in pullout strength over that for a glass fiber with no surface modifier<br>
(negative indicates a decrease in strength).<br><br>
[0241] Glass Fiber Gypsum, Waterborne Epoxy Surface-Modifier. Also<br>
included for comparison is a waterborne epoxy size. A sizing composition was prepared by<br>
mixing 100 g of Epirez 3519 50% solids waterborne epoxy emulsion with EpiCure curing<br>
agent, both from Shell. The surface-modifier was applied at room temperature to strands<br>
removed from a sheet of woven type E fiberglass boat cloth as in the previous example.<br>
The fiber strands were then weighted and hung to dry in a 100 C convection oven for 2<br>
hours. The dried, cured fibers were then cut to 4" sections, massed, and embedded in a<br>
gypsum block and tested following the procedure from the previous examples. The results<br><br>
-68-<br>
were recorded and compared to determine the amount of surface-modifier add-on and pull-<br>
out strength improvement from control fibers in the same matrix.<br><br>
[0242] The polyurethane latex surface-modifier and waterborne epoxy surface-<br>
modifier are included for comparison with some preferred embodiments of the invention.<br>
Interfacial bond strength was not improved by adding these surface-modifiers between the<br>
gypsum and the fiber. Instead, polyurethane latex and waterborne epoxy reduced the pull-<br>
out strength, despite the increased surface contour and denier of the fiber. This may<br>
explain why sizing is removed as part of conventional processes, because one of ordinary<br>
skill in the art would not expect sizing to improve pullout strength.<br>
[0243] Glass Fiber Gypsum. HPMC Surface-Modifier. A sizing composition<br>
was prepared by mixing 5 g of Methocel 240 from Dow Chemical (40,000 cps @ 2 wt%,<br>
25 C) into 100 g of 85 C tap water. The dispersion was mixed for 5 minutes and then<br>
cooled to 45 C. The surface-modifier was applied to strands removed from a sheet of<br>
woven type E fiberglass boat cloth by winding the strands onto a small roller, submerging<br>
the roller in the sizing composition, and unwinding the strands through the composition.<br>
The fiber strands were then tensioned and hung to dry in a 45 C convection oven for 30<br>
minutes. The dried fibers were cut to 4" sections, massed, and embedded in a gypsum<br>
block and tested following the previous procedures. The results were recorded and<br>
compared to determine the amount of surface-modifier add-on. The pull-out strength was<br>
measured and a percent improvement was calculated compared to the control specimens.<br><br>
-69-<br><br>
[0244] These results show that with less add-on, such as used in conventional<br>
sizing applications, the HPMC1 surface-modifier reduces the pull-out strength. It is<br>
believed, without limiting in any way, that the weakening is due to migration of the polymer<br>
away from the fiber, leaving a porous and a weak interface between the fiber and cement<br>
matrix. However, increased add-on results in significantly improved pull-out strength and<br>
energy compared to the control specimen.<br>
[0245] Glass Fiber Gypsum. Low Molecular Weight HPMC Surface Modifier.<br>
A sizing composition was prepared by mixing 30 g of a lower viscosity grade HPMC than<br>
the previous example (from Aldrich with viscosity grade of 5 cps @ 2 wt%, 25 C) into 100<br>
g of 85 C tap water. The dispersion was mixed for 5 minutes and then cooled to 25 C.<br>
The surface-modifier was applied to type E boat cloth glass fiber as described in the<br>
previous example. The fiber strands were then tensioned and hung to dry in a 45 C<br>
convection oven for 30 minutes. The dried fibers were cut to 4" sections, massed, and<br>
embedded in a gypsum block and tested following the previous procedures. The results<br>
were recorded and compared to determine the amount of surface modifier add-on and pull-<br>
out strength improvement.<br><br><br>
-70-<br><br>
[0246] This low viscosity grade cellulose ether did not improve fiber-cement<br>
adhesion as much as the previous example using a high viscosity grade HPMC. A greater<br>
amount of add-on was required to achieve a similar level of improvement in pull-out<br>
strength. For example, the pull-out energy of a fiber sized with 200% add-on of 40,000<br>
cps HPMC is greater than that of a fiber with 500% add-on of 5 cps HPMC. The pullout<br>
strength appears to follow a trend similar to as the nail pull index and flexural strength of<br>
gypsum-based HPMC-reinforced composite panels, which are dramatically affected by<br>
viscosity grade, amount of additive and degree of substitution of substituent groups, such<br>
as methyl and hydroxy-propyl groups.<br>
[0247] Glass Fiber Gypsum. High Molecular Weight HPMC / Polvurethane<br>
Surface Modification. A surface treatment composition was prepared by adding 4 g of<br>
Airflex 423, a 50% solids polyurethane latex emulsion with an internal cross-linker from<br>
Air Products Inc., to 100 g of 85 C tap water. Three grams of HPMC (Methocel 240 with<br>
a viscosity grade of 40,000 cps from Dow Chemical) was then added to the mixture. The<br>
dispersion was mixed for 5 minutes and then cooled to 45 C. The surface treatment was<br>
applied to type E boat cloth glass fiber as described in the previous examples. The fiber<br>
strands were then tensioned and hung to dry in a 45 C convection oven for 30 minutes.<br>
The dried fibers were cut to 4" sections, massed, and embedded in a gypsum block and<br>
tested following the previous procedure. The results were recorded and compared to<br>
determine the amount of size add-on and pull-out strength improvement from control fibers<br>
in the same matrix.<br><br><br>
-71-<br>
[0248] It is believed that the latex component of this sizing composition<br>
functions mainly to physically cross-link the HPMC and create a more uniform coating. It is<br>
observed that fibers coated with a reinforcing sizing that is physically or chemically cross-<br>
linked demonstrate improved fiber pull-out strength even with conventional amounts of<br>
sizing add-on. It is believed that the sizing does not dissolve and migrate away from the<br>
fiber. Thus, it remains an effective reinforcement, even at low levels. It is observed that<br>
fiber pull-out strength increases linearly with sizing add-on within the limits tested here.<br>
[0249] Glass Fiber Gypsum. High Molecular Weight HPMC/Organic Titanate.<br>
 surface treatment composition was prepared by mixing 3 g of Methocel 240 from Dow<br>
Chemical (40,000 cps @ 2 wt%, 25 C) into 100 g of 85 C tap water. The dispersion was<br>
mixed for 5 minutes and then cooled to 60 C. Five drops of Tyzor 131, organic titanium<br>
chelate, from DuPont Chemical were added to the dispersion. This mixture was mixed for<br>
an additional 10 minutes and then cooled to 45 C. The surface treatment was applied to<br>
type E boat cloth glass fiber as described in the previous examples. The fiber strands were<br>
then tensioned and hung to dry in a 100 degrees centigrade convection oven for 30<br>
minutes. The dried fibers were cut to 4" sections, massed, and embedded in a gypsum<br>
block and tested following the previous procedure. The results were recorded and<br>
compared to determine the amount of size add-on and pull-out strength improvement from<br>
control fibers in the same matrix.<br><br>
[0250] Glass Fiber Gypsum. High Molecular Weight, Surface Treated<br>
HEMC/Melamine Sulfonate A sizing composition was prepared by mixing 1 g of<br>
sulfonated melamme polycondensate (Melement F17g from Degussa) and 3 g of surface<br>
treated, high viscosity HEMC (Culminal 15000PFR from Hercules) into 100g of tap water<br>
at room temperature. The mixture was stirred for two minutes. Ten drops of a 1 %<br><br>
-72-<br>
solution of calcium hydroxide was then added to the mixture which was stirred for another<br>
five minutes. The resulting sizing solution was applied to type E boat cloths glass fiber.<br>
Glass fiber strands measuring approximately two feet long were tensioned across a<br>
cardboard frame 100 as shown in Fig. 30. The frame 140 and fibers 120 were placed over<br>
wax paper and the solution of surface modifier was spread across the fibers. The frame was<br>
then lifted away from the paper, pulling the fibers through the surface modifier. The fibers<br>
were then dried in the framework in a 120 degrees centigrade convection over for 30<br>
minutes The surface modifier had good mechanical properties and strong swelling<br>
characteristics.<br>
[0251] Mold Resistance. This test method is adapted from the mold test<br>
described in ASTM D3273-94 (Resistance to Growth of Mold on the Surface of Interior<br>
Coatings in an Environmental Chamber), which is incorporated as background for the test<br>
herein in its entirety. The adapted test provides a procedure for photographic recordings<br>
and comparative descriptions of specimens, which are representations of its susceptibility to<br>
mold growth. The extent of mold coverage, thickness, and color is recorded weekly, along<br>
with digital photographs of the specimens. In the modified procedure, a 6in. x 6in. square<br>
specimen was prepared in a form using no release agent or oil, which eliminates any<br>
extraneous food source for mold. The specimen was cut on all edges using a table saw.<br>
Each specimen was supported vertically in a rack that allowed adequate circulation of air<br>
through the gaps at the bottom of the rack. The rack was placed into a Forma 3033<br>
Steri-cult incubator and mold spores were circulated from the bottom to top of the<br>
chamber. The incubating environment was maintained at 90 °F (32.2 °C) and 90% relative<br>
humidity. The specimens were analyzed for mold growth and rotated weekly. The mold<br>
coverage, thickness, and color were observed, recorded, and documented with digital<br>
photographs, using a fluorescent lamp from above to enhance the contrast of the growth on<br>
the sample faces.<br>
[0252] For example, paperless wallboard core with a cellulose ether added and<br>
wallboard having a single ply of newsprint showed no mold growth at 24 days. With 1<br>
wt% starch added, paperless wallboard showed 30% mold coverage and 40% mold density<br>
at day 7, and mold coverage of 90% and mold density of 50% at day 14. A commercial,<br>
multi-ply paper wallboard having 80-100% coverage of mold growth at the end of 7 days<br><br>
WO 2004/065319	PCT/US2004/001957<br>
-73-<br>
(National Gypsum). Thus, under high humidity conditions paperless wallboard and<br>
wallboard having a single ply of newsprint exhibited much greater resistance to mold<br>
growth than commercial, multi-ply paper covered wallboard.<br>
[0253] HPMC Sizing Solution, High Solids, Viscosity. A sizing solution of<br>
hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose (HPMC) was created by mixing 5 weight percent (wt%)<br>
water and 85 wt% isopropanol. Ten parts of a HPMC (Methocel 240 with a viscosity<br>
grade of 40,000 cps) was then slowly added to 90 parts of the mixture by weight, while<br>
stirring. The resulting sizing solution had moderate viscosity at room temperature and a<br>
solids content of 10 wt%. An evenly dispersed and coherent HPMC film was produced on<br>

[0254] HPMC Sizing Solution, High Solids, Medium Viscosity. A sizing<br>
solution of HPMC was created by mixing 10 wt% water to 80 wt% isopropanol. Ten parts<br>
of a HPMC (Methocel 240 viscosity grade of 40,000 cps) was then slowly added to 90<br>
parts of the mixture by weight, while stirring. The resulting sizing solution had medium<br>
viscosity at room temperature and a solids content of 10 wt%. An evenly dispersed and<br>
coherent HPMC film was produced on a glass surface. In contrast, an aqueous solution of<br>
HPMC at this concentration and temperature would have a very high viscosity of a film gel,<br>
and could not be used as a sizing solution.<br>
[0255] Physically Crosslinked Sizing Solution. A sizing solution was created by<br>
first mixing 7 wt% of vinyl acetate emulsion with an internal crosslinker (e.g. Airflex 423<br>
from Air Products) with additional 3 wt% water. Then, 80 wt% of isopropanol was added<br>
to 10 wt% of the sizing solution while stirring. Finally, 10 wt% of an HPMC (Methocel<br>
240, viscosity grade 40,000 cps) was slowly added while stirring. The resulting sizing<br>
solution produced an evenly dispersed film on a glass surface. Furthermore, the size on the<br>
glass had good add-on and had limited solubility in water, resisting redissolution.<br>
[0256] Chemically Crosslinked Sizing Solution. A sizing solution was created<br>
by mixing 5 wt% of a 50 wt% aqueous solution of a melamine-formaldehyde resin, such as<br>
Cymel 385 from Cytec, with an additional 5 wt% of water. Then, 80 wt% of isopropanol<br>
was added while stirring. Finally, 10 wt% of an HPMC (Methocel 240, viscosity grade<br>
40,000 cps) was slowly added to the mixture while stirring. The resulting sizing solution<br><br>

an additional hour. The mixture was then cooled and neutralized with concentrated<br>
hydrochloric acid. The product was collected by filtration, washed several times with<br>
ethanol, and then dried in an oven at 100 degrees C. The viscosity of the MCMC was<br>
measured to be 80 cps for an aqueous solution consisting of 2 wt% MCMC and water at<br>
25 °C.<br>

sodium hydroxide dissolved in 10 g of water. The slurry was stirred for one hour at room<br>
temperature. 1,3-Propanesultone (6.96 g) of was added dropwise to the mixture which<br>
was then heated to 70 degrees C over a period of one hour and held at that temperature for<br>
an additional hour. The mixture was then cooled and added in small increments to acetone.<br>
The resulting precipitate was collected by filtration and dried at 100 degrees C. The<br>
viscosity of the SPMC was measured to be 180 cps for an aqueous solution consisting of 2<br>

suspension was neutralized. The product was filtered, washed several times with ethanol,<br>
and dried in an oven at 100 degrees C.<br>
[0260] Base Hydrolysis of Methyl Cellulose (Hydrolyzed MC). Methyl cellulose<br>
(40 g, Dow, viscosity grade of 400 cps) was suspended in 772 g of isopropanol and<br>
flushed with nitrogen. A solution of 10 g of sodium hydroxide dissolved in 10 g water was<br>
then added dropwise. The mixture was stirred for 80 minutes at room temperature. The<br>
reaction temperature was then raised to 75 degrees C over a period of 30 minutes and kept<br>
at that temperature for 3 hours. After cooling to room temperature, the solid was collected<br>
by filtration and then resuspended in isopropanol. Concentrated sulfuric acid was added<br>
dropwise until the suspension was neutralized. The product was filtered, washed several<br>
times with ethanol, and dried in an oven at 100 degrees C. The viscosity of a 2 wt. %<br>
solution in water 25 degrees C of the hydrolyzed MC was measured to be 10 cps.<br>

[0274]	HPMC-Coated Glass Mat Board. Sample boards were made with<br>
HPMC-coated glass mat facing. The glass mat was 0.75 oz randomly distributed non-<br>
woven standard glass mat. Sheets of mat 9" x 7" were cut from the roll and coated with<br>
Culminal HPMC 1034. The sheets were coated using a dispersion of 50 g of HPMC added<br>
to 1800 g of 80 C tap water. The dispersion was filtered over the glass mat sheet on a<br>
plastic mesh. Vacuum was applied to facilitate filtering and cool the dispersion. As the<br>
dispersion cooled, the HPMC particles hydrated and gelled on the mat surface. The coated<br>
mat was then dried at 150 C for 30 minutes. The add-on to the mat was approximately 6%<br>
by weight. A coated mat was used to face a non-enhanced control gypsum core by placing<br>
a coated sheet on the bottom of a horizontal molding system, pouring the slurry into the<br>
mold, and placing a control, uncoated sheet on top of the unset stucco slurry before closing<br>
the mold. For the core formulation, 500 g beta calcium sulfate hemi-hydrate (stucco) was<br>
dry-mixed with 5 g of sugar-coated ground gypsum accelerator (BMA), 1 g of Melment<br>
F17G, sulfonated melamine-formaldehyde condensate dispersant, and 0.25 g of sodium<br>
trimetaphosphate (STMP). The powder was added to 750 g of 21 C tap water with 1 drop<br>
of 40% aqueous diethylene-tetramine pentacetic acid, sodium salt (retarder). The slurry<br>
was mixed for 10 seconds in a 2L Waring blender and, after a 30-second pause, poured<br>
into a mold with glass mat facing. The set board was removed from the mold after 10<br>
minutes and dried for 48 hours in a forced convection oven at 50 C. The dried board was<br>
cut into 9" x 3" samples, massed, and accurately dimensioned to calculate density and<br>
board-weight. A sample was tested for flexural strength with the coated mat in tension<br>
using a three-point-bend apparatus on an Instron Model 4466 with a one-ton load cell. The<br>
results are listed below.<br><br>
