COMPLETE SPECIFICATION (See Section 10, rule 13)<br>
PLASMA ACCELERATOR ARRANGEMENT<br>
THALES ELECTRON DEVICES GMBH of SOFLINGER STRASSE 100, 89077 ULM, GERMANY, GERMAN Company<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed : -<br><br><br>
Plasma accelerator arrangement<br>
Description<br>
The'  invention   relates   to  a  plasma  accelerator arrangement.<br>
Plasma accelerator arrangements are known, in particular, in the form of what are known as Hall arrangements. Here, an ionizable gas, in particular a noble gas, is fed to a plasma chamber. The plasma chamber is essentially annular around a central longitudinal axis and is open in a main expulsion direction parallel to the longitudinal axis. Arranged at .the foot of the plasma chamber, opposite to the expulsion direction, is an anode. A cathode, as electron source, is arranged outside the plasma chamber, offset radially with respect thereto. The. walls of the plasma chamber consist of nonconductive material. A magnetic system produces in the plasma chamber a substantially radially oriented magnetic field by means of a first, inner and a second, outer magnetic pole. An electron stream emitted by the cathode is accelerated in the electric field between cathode and anode and fed to the plasma chamber and, in the plasma chamber, is deflected at right angles to the electric potential gradient and at right angles to the magnetic field lines by the radial magnetic field, and ionizes the propellant gas in the chamber. From the plasma formed in the process, the positively charged ions are accelerated in the expulsion direction. Some of the electrons emitted by the cathode are used to neutralize the ion beam.<br>
An  arrangement  of  this  type,  in  which  a  special<br>
i magnetic  field  design  is  intended  to  increase  the<br><br>
efficiency and the life time,  is known,  for example, from HI'.0 541 309 A.l . Via oppositely polarized magnetic-pole shoes,  opposite and spaced apart radially from each other in the expulsion area of the annular plasma chamber, an inner and an outer coil system effect a' substantially radial magnetic field in this area of the plasma chamber. The deeper area of the plasma chamber, with the annular electrode, is surrounded by a magnetic shield.<br>
US 5 847 493 A shows a plasma accelerator based on the Hall effect, in which an inner and an outer coil arrangement in each case produce two magnetic poles spaced apart in the expulsion direction, the respectively radially opposite poles of the inner and outer coil arrangement being oppositely polarized and in turn producing the substantially radial magnetic field. A similar plasma accelerator arrangement with partially conically shaped pole shoes is described in EP 0 982 976 Al.<br>
DE 198 28 704 Al describes a plasma accelerator arrangement in which, into a circularly cylindrical plasma chamber, a focused electron beam accelerated outside the chamber is introduced on the longitudinal axis and is guided on the axis by a permanent periodic magnet arrangement surrounding the plasma chamber cylindrically and having alternately aligned stages.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to specify an advantageous plasma accelerator arrangement, in particular as a drive source for spacecraft.<br>
The invention is described in patent claim 1. The dependent claims contain advantageous refinements and developments of the invention.<br><br>
A significant, aspect, of the present invention is the fundamentally different configuration of the magnetic field which penetrates the plasma chamber, as compared with known arrangements. While, in the known 5 arrangements, the magnetic system having a pole system on the inside and having a second pole system on the outside with respect to the toroidal plasma chamber, is substantially radially aligned and frequently closed , via a magnetic return path behind the plasma chamber,<br>
10 the invention proposes a magnetic system which comprises, both radially on the inside and radially on the outside with respect to the plasma chamber, a magnet arrangement having a pole change in the longitudinal direction, that is to say in a direction<br>
15 parallel to the longitudinal axis of the arrangement. In particular, in a preferred arrangement, the pole changes of the outer and inner magnet arrangement can take place in the same direction, so that identical magnetic poles separated radially by the plasma chamber<br>
2 0 and belonging to the two separate magnet arrangements are opposite one another.<br>
In a first embodiment, the magnetic system can be ^designed in one stage, in each case with a pole change<br>
2 5 for the outer jand the inner magnetic system by means of opposite magnetic poles spaced apart in the longitudinal direction. At least one of the two magnetic poles in each case is located in the ] on c.j i I uili iiM 1  direction  in  the  area  of  the  plnr.inn<br>
30 chamber. Both poles of the single-stage magnetic system, spaced apart in the longitudinal direction, are preferably located within the longitudinal extent of the plasma chamber. Particularly advantageous is an arrangement in which the magnetic system is of inulti-<br>
35 stage design with a plurality of successive subsystems in the longitudinal direction, each of which has an outer and an inner magnet arrangement and in which the successive subsystems in the longitudinal direction are<br><br>
. 4 -i<br>
alternately  aligned  in  opposite  directions.   The radially  opposite  poles  preferably  have  the  same direction, which results in a particularly advantageous distribution of the electron drift. 5<br>
Particularly beneficial is a plasma accelerator arrangement according to the invention in which there is still at least one electrode arrangement between the cathode and the anode in the area of the side walls of<br>
10 the plasma chamber, which arrangement is at an intermediate potential between cathode potentia and anode potential. Oh such an electrode, electrons which have merely picked up energy from part of the potential difference   between   cathode   and   anode   can   be<br>
15 intercepted. The potential difference between cathode and anode can as a result be subdivided into two or more acceleration stages. Losses as a result of electron-wall collisions can be reduced substantially as a result. In particular, the electrical efficiency<br>
20 increases rnonotonically with the number of potential stages. The electrodes in the longitudinal direction are advantageously in each case placed between the pole ends of a magnetic system or magnetic subsystem. This results  in  a  particularly  beneficial  course  of<br>
25  electrical and magnetic fields.<br>
The invention is explained in more detail below using<br>
preferred exemplary embodiments and with reference to<br>
the figures, in which: 30<br>
Figure 1  shows a known plasma chamber in side view;<br>
Figure 2   shows field courses and currents in a plasma chamber according to the invention;<br>
Figure 3   shows a view in the direction of the axis of<br>
35	symmetry relating to figure 2;<br>
Figure 4   shows one stage in a magnet arrangement;<br>
Figure 5   shows a preferred structure in side view.<br><br>
-	5 –<br>
-	In plasma physics, it. is known that because of the high mobility of the electrons, caused by their low mass as compared with the generally positively charged ions, the plasma behaves similarly to a metallic conductor and assumes a constant potential.<br>
However, if a plasma is located between two electrodes at different potentials, then the plasma assumes approximately the potential of the electrode with the potential that is higher for the positive ions (anode) since the electrons move very rapidly toward the anode until the potential of the plasma is at the approximately constant potential of the anode, and the plasma is therefore field-free. Only in a comparatively thin boundary layer at the cathode does the potential drop sharply in the cathode drop, as it is known.<br>
j In a plasma, therefore, different potentials can be maintained only if the conductivity of the plasma is not isotropic. Advantageous, high anisotropy of the conductivity may be produced in a beneficial way in the arrangement according to the invention. Since, because of the Lorentz force, during a movement transversely with respect to magnetic field lines, electrons experience a force at right angles to the magnetic field lines and at right angles to the direction of movement, although electrons can be displaced easily in the direction of the magnetic field lines, that is to say in the direction of the magnetic field lines, there is a high electrical conductivity, and a potential gradient in this direction is easily balanced out. Acceleration of the electrons by an electric field component at right angles to the magnetic field lines counteracts the aforementioned Lorentz force, however, so that the electrons move spirally around the magnetic field lines. Accordingly, at right angles to the magnetic field lines, electric fields may be produced without immediate compensation by electron flow.  For<br><br>
-	6 –<br>
-	the stability of such electric fields, it is particularly beneficial if the associated electric equipotential surfaces extend approximately parallel to the magnetic field lines, and therefore electric and 5  magnetic fields are substantially crossed.<br>
In figure 1, the basic structure of a conventional plasma accelerator based on the Hall principle, (Hall thruster) is sketched. A plasma chamber PK is designed<br>
10 toroidally around a central axis of symmetry SA and has insulating side walls WA, WI and a rear wall RW. The plasma chamber is open on one side in a longitudinal direction LR parallel to the axis of symmetry SA and, at this point, can also have an acceleration grid.<br>
15<br>
Outside the plasma chamber, a cathode KA is arranged as<br>
an electron source. An anode AN is arranged at the foot<br>
end  of  the  plasma  chamber,  facing  away  from  the<br>
expulsion opening AU. An electric field E between anode i 20  and   cathode '  runs   within   the   plasma   chamber,<br>
substantially parallel to the longitudinal direction<br>
LR.  A magnetic  system has  a  radially  outer  first<br>
magnetic pole MA  (for example a north pole)  and a<br>
second radially inner magnetic pole MI (for example a<br>
25   south pole) . The two magnetic poles are designed to be<br>
substantially annularly  symmetrical  to  the  axis  of<br>
symmetry SA and are    connected via a magnetic return<br>
path MR behind the plasma chamber. The magnetic system<br>
produces  a  substantially  radially  oriented  magnetic<br>
30  field B in the plasma chamber PK.<br>
Some of the electrons emi tted by the cathode are accelerated in the electric field between anode and cathode and led into the plasma chamber and there are 35- deflected by the magnetic field B at right angles to the direction of movement of the electrons and at right angles to the magnetic field lines, that is to say substantially at  right  angles  to  the plane of  the<br><br>
- 7 - • <br>
drnwinq in the ' nkol c!), AS a result1 of the drift movement of the electrons, forced in this way, about the axis of symmetry, these electrons remain in the plasma chamber over a relatively long time before they 5 arrive at the anode AN. During the movement within the plasma chamber, the electrons produce positive ions and secondary electrons as a result of collisions with gas introduced into the plasma chamber, for example xenon. The ions and electrons form a highly conductive plasma<br>
10  in the plasma chamber. The ions are expelle,d from the<br>
chamber  in the  longitudinal direction.  In order  to<br>
avoid charging of the arrangement, electrons from the<br>
cathode KA are added to the expelled ion stream,  so<br>
 that  the expelled plasma  stream PB is  electrically<br>
15 neutral. Such an arrangement is known per se in various embodiments.<br>
• Figure 2 shows a multi-stage arrangement according to the  present   invention,   in  which  again,   in  a<br>
20  substantially toroidal plasma chamber, whose form is<br>
 accessible  in  individual  variations,  an  anode  is<br>
arranged by a rear wall facing away from the expulsion<br>
direction. The significant factor in the arrangement<br>
according to figure 2 is that the magnetic system no<br>
25 longer comprises an outer and an inner pole, which are connected by a magnetic return path, but that, with respect to the plasma chamber, on the outside is a magnet arrangement RMA which, in each of the successive stages  SO,  SI,  S2  in  the  longitudinal  direction<br>
30  parallel  to  the  axis  of  symmetry,  intrinsically „ comprises both opposite magnetic poles spaced apart in .the longitudinal direction LR.  In the same way,  a further multi-stage magnet arrangement RMI is arranged radially on the  inside with respect  to  the plasma<br>
35 chamber, which again in each stage comprises intrinsically both magnetic poles spaced apart in the longitudinal direction LR. The two magnet arrangements RMA and RMI of each stage are radially opposite each<br><br>
- 8 -<br>
. other  with  substantially  the  same  extent  in  the<br>
  longitudinal direction LR. The two magnet arrangements<br>
are aligned with the same alignment, that is to say the<br>
same sequence of poles in the longitudinal direction<br>
5  LR. As a result,  identical poles  (N-N and S-S)  are<br>
V radially opposite each other and the magnetic fields<br>
are intrinsically closed for each of the two magnet<br>
arrangements. The course of the magnetic fields from<br>
radially opposite magnet arrangements RMA and RMI can,<br>
10  as a result, be viewed as separated by a center surface<br>
located  substantially  in  the  center  of  the plasma<br>
chamber. The magnetic field lines extend in a curved<br>
shape between the magnetic poles of each arrangement<br>
without passing through this central surface, which is<br>
15 -not necessarily planar. Therefore, substantially only<br>
the  magnetic  field  from  one  of  the  two  magnet<br>
arrangements RMA or RMI acts on each radial side of<br>
such a central surface.<br>
20 A significant difference from the arrangement according to figure 2 is that the magnetic field in the plasma chamber does i not run substantially monotonically between two opposite poles; instead the magnetic field lines on the same radial side of the central surface in<br>
25  rthe toroidal plasma chamber are closed.<br>
The above embodiments also apply to a magnetic system having only a single inner and outer stage. Such a single magnetic stage may be formed, for example, by 30 two concentric annular permanent magnets with poles .. spaced apart substantially parallel to the axis of symmetry SA. Such an arrangement is sketched in isolation in figure 4.<br>
35- Preference is given to an embodiment of the invention according to figure 2, in which two or more such arrangements are arranged one behind another in the longitudinal  direction  LR,  the  pole  alignment  of<br><br>
- 9 <br>
-successive magnet arrangements being opposite, with the result that the opposite poles of successive magnet arrangements in the longitudinal direction are of the same type, and therefore no magnetic field short 5 circuit occurs, and the design [lacuna] above-described field courses remains substantially maintained for all the successive stages.<br>
The successive magnetic fields firstly have a focusing 10 effect on the primary electrons emitted by the cathode and fed into the plasma chamber and, secondly, prevent the outflow of secondary electrons produced in the plasma chamber from one stage to the next. i<br>
!<br>
15  A plasma accelerator arrangement is preferred in which, in addition to cathode and anode, at least one further electrode is also provided, which is at an intermediate potential  lying between cathode potential and anode potential.   Such   an   intermediate   electrode   is<br>
20 advantageously arranged on at least one side wall, preferably in the form of two part electrodes opposite each other on the inner and outer side wall of the plasma chamber. It is beneficial in particular to position the electrode  in its position between  two<br>
25 magnetic poles in the longitudinal direction. In the arrangement according to figure 2, a plurality of stages SO, Si, S2 in the longitudinal direction are provided with a magnetic subsystem in each case and an electrode system in each case. The magnetic subsystems<br>
30 in each case comprise an inner and an outer magnetic ring, as already described and sketched in figure 4. The part electrode systems in the successive stages SO, SI, S2 each comprise an outer electrode ring AAO, AAl, AA2 and,  radially opposite,  an inner electrode ring<br>
3 5' AIO, All, AI2, the extent of the electrodes in the longitudinal direction being substantially the same for the outer and the inner rings. The mutually opposite electrode rings of each subsystem, that is to say AAO<br><br><br>
- 10 -<br>
and AM") and AM mid All and AA2 and AI2 are in oncli<br>
case at  the  same potential,  it being possible  in<br>
pai t u:ul;u  i:ui  the electrodes AAO and AlO to be a I.<br>
ground  potential  of  the  entire  arrangement.  The<br>
5^ electric  fields  produced  by  the  electrodes  run<br>
approximately at right angles to the magnetic field<br>
lines, in regions which are important for the formation<br>
of the plasma.  In particular in the region of  the<br>
highest potential gradient between the electrodes of<br>
10 successive stages, the magnetic and electric field lines extend substantially in a crossed manner, so that the secondary electrons produced along the path of the primary electrons cannot cause any direct short circuit of the electrodes.  Since the secondary electrons can<br>
15 move only along the magnetic field lines of the substantially toroidal multi-stage magnetic system, the plasma jet produced remains substantially limited to the cylindrical layer volume of the focused primary electrons. There are bulges of the plasma substantially<br>
20  only in the region of the sign change of the axial <:- magnetic field component where the points substantially radially toward poles of . magnet arrangements.></:->
25*' In the arrangement sketched, the result is plasma concentrations in the longitudinal direction in positions between successive electrodes which, at the same time, coincide with the pole points of the successive magnet arrangements.  With the arrangement<br>
30  sketched in figure 2,  the plasma in the individual ' successive stages can advantageously be connected to the  stage-by-stage  different  potentials  of   the successive electrodes. For this purpose, in particular the electrodes  and  the magnet  arrangements  in  the<br>
35* longitudinal direction are arranged in such a way that the physical phase angles of the quasi-periodic magnetic field, as compared with the likewise quasi-periodic electric field, measured between the absolute<br>
i i<br><br>
- 11 -<br>
minimum of the axial magnetic field with respect to the<br>
'electrode center is displaced by a maximum of +/- 4 5°,<br>
in particular a maximum of  + /-  15°.  In  this case,<br>
contact  between  the  magnetic  field  lines  and  the<br>
5  electrode arranged on the side wall of  the plasma<br>
chamber can be achieved and, as a result of the easy<br>
displaceability of  the electrons along the magnetic<br>
field lines,  the plasma potential can be set to the<br>
electrode  potential  of   this  stage.   The  plasma<br>
10  concentrations  of  various  successive  stages  are<br>
therefore at different potentials.<br>
The location of the highest potential gradient in the axial direction is therefore in a plasma layer which is<br>
15  identified by the radial magnetic field curves which<br>
;,have an electrically insulating effect in the axial<br>
direction. At these points,  the acceleration of the<br>
positive  ions  takes  place  substantially  in  the<br>
longitudinal  direction.  Since  there  are  sufficient<br>
20 secondary electrons which, as Hall currents on closed drift paths, cross in the toroidal structure, a substantially neutral plasma is accelerated in the longitudinal direction toward the expulsion opening of the plasma chajmber. In the process, in one layer plane<br>
25 at a specific position in the longitudinal direction LR of the arrangement, there are opposite annular Hall currents II and IA at different radii, as sketched in figure 2 and figure 3.<br>
30  The aforementioned beneficial phase shift of the quasi-  ;, periodic  magnetic  and  electric  structures  may  be achieved firstly by means of an arrangement according to  figure  2,  with  the  aforementioned  permissible displacement,  of  the electrodes with respect  to  the<br>
35* position sketched there by the aforementioned maximum of +•/- 45°, in particular a maximum of +/-- 15°. An alternative variant is sketched in figure 5, where the periodic length of the electrode stages Aajr AA,^ and<br><br>
- 12 –<br>
AIj, Alio is twice as great as the periodic ranks of successive magnetic ring arrangements. Such an arrangement can also be subdivided into stages which have a length twice as long as those in figure 2 and which then in each case contain two opposite magnetic subsystems and an electrode system.<br>
i In the arrangement sketched in figure 5, in regions where the electrodes bridge the pole points of successive magnetic subsystems, contact zones are produced, at which the secondary electrons following the magnetic lines are picked up by the electrodes and therefore a contact zone is formed between the plasma and an electrode, whereas at pole points which are at the same time located between two successive electrodes in the longitudinal direction, an isolation zone with a high potential gradient is produced in the plasma.<br>
In another embodiment of a magnetic system which has many stages in the longitudinal direction, the opposite outer magnetic ring and inner magnetic ring of each stage can also be provided with opposite pole alignment, so that a longitudinal section corresponding to figure 2 through the arrangement of each stage results in a magnetic quadrupole field. The other measures outlined according to the invention can be used in a corresponding way in such an arrangement. The drift current curves run in the same direction, in a plane at right angles to the longitudinal direction, differing from figure 3.<br>
The above features and those specified in the claims can .advantageously be implemented both individually and in various combinations. The invention is not restricted to the exemplary embodiments described, but can be modified in many ways within the context of specialist knowledge. In particular, strict symmetry about  the  axis  of  symmetry  SA  is  not  absolutely<br><br>
