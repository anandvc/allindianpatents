THE COMPLETE SPECIFICATION SECTION 10<br>
Self-unloading confined concrete elevated storage and retrieval system and a process of transferring rail borne cargo to carriers or barges<br>
(SUCCESS)<br>
Auduth Timblo, an Indian citizen of Cidade de Goa, Vainguinin Beach, Goa- 403004, India<br>
The following specification particularly described and ascertains the nature of<br>
this invention and the manner in which it is performed:    <br><br><br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a self-unloading confined concrete elevated storage and retrieval system and a process of transferring rail borne cargo to ocean going vessels, coastal ships or barges. The invention is named SUCCESS.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Conventionally, storage of bulk materials is done by creating large stockyard space on land or by reclaiming land from the sea. The storage capacity of such systems is relatively less and also occupies a large footprint area.<br>
There has been an increase in iron ore exports. The spurt in this export tonnage is due to a demand increase in international markets particularly, the Peoples Republic of China. Largely ore coming from Karnataka as well as a slight increase in Goan iron ore production meets this increase in demand. The tonnage moved from Karnataka, which goes as direct export or as blended with Goan ore has touched 10 million MT. The inland ore can be transported by road or rail though rail transport is preferred.<br>
Hitherto, wagon tippling system was installed at the Mormugoa port to be<br>
used for rail cargo but was never operated. The wagon tippling system has a disadvantage of catering only a limited quantity of ore. Further tippler cannot be continuously fed on account of the connected operations before and after tippling. Even assuming that one wagon tippler is somehow installed, it can at best cater to 2 million MT per year. This capacity cannot meet even the present demand. More than one tippler is simply not feasible owing to space constraint<br>
and therefore such facility gets out-dated in relation to capacity even before the<br>
2<br><br>
facility is commissioned. Apart from the above, major modifications will be required in the MOHP (Mechanical Ore Handling Plant) for linking and integrating the facility which will in turn adversely affect operations at MOHP for prolonged periods. Hence, setting up such a facility is unlikely to provide a satisfactory solution. In short, adding one wagon tippler will not help in handling of the buoyant international market forces and cash in on the opportunity to increase the throughput.<br>
The lack of adequate space in port area rules out the use of tippler with conventional coupler wagon or with a rotary coupler wagons because the yard facilities cannot be provided. Also the space would not allow for installation of more than one tippler, which will be totally inadequate to handle the project traffic. System based upon tippler operations would not fulfill several other operating conditions like avoidance of wagon examination, sanctity of rake consist remaining intact, rake turn round not exceeding 5 hours etc.<br>
OBJECT OF THE INVENTION<br>
The object of the present invention is to overcome the afore-mentioned drawbacks and provide for an innovative solution for ensuring maximum storage of low repose ore, pellets as well as high moisture fine in a confined area.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to homogenously blend cargoes from storage areas.<br>
3<br><br>
Still another object of the present invention is to provide a confined concrete elevated storage system, which uses the vertical space efficiently allowing larger storage on the same footprint area.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to allow overall four times additional handling of rail borne cargo as compared to conventional wagon tippler doing the same job by using bottom discharge wagons.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
To achieve the above objectives, the present invention relates to self-unloading confined concrete elevated storage and retrieval system comprising:<br>
-	an enclosure of rectangular cross section, said section being open at the top end and having at least two rows of compartments for storing the cargo,<br>
-	a hopper type means at the bottom end of the each compartment of this enclosure to provide mass flow for retrieval.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention the said system has a height of about 16 meters and comprises of at least six compartments. The system also includes a cover/top to prevent dust pollution and ingress of rainwater or moisture. Air canons may be provided to prevent the cargo from sticking to the walls. The compartment walls may be lined with UHMWPP (ultra high molecular weight polypropylene). The system preferably includes automatically operated gates at the bottom to regulate the cargo transfer to tunnel conveyors and also means for blending the cargo in predetermined amount between the said compartments.<br>
4<br><br>
The present invention in one of its embodiments also provides for a process of transferring rail borne cargo to carriers or barges comprising of the following steps:<br>
-	receiving ore brought in by bottom discharge hopper wagons and unloading the same in a track hopper by automatic opening means of bottom doors,<br>
-	transferring to a tunnel conveyor the said ore received in the track hopper from the train by paddle feeders<br>
-	receiving ore through the tunnel conveyor on to a tripper conveyor mounted atop a confined concrete elevated storage and retrieval system by means of a high angle conveyor and<br>
-	transferring the ore through the gate means positioned below said confined concrete elevated storage system compartments to ore retrieving tunnel conveyors running below the confined storage system to load carriers of barges.<br>
Self unloading confined concrete elevated storage and retrieval system provides a novel and innovative solution for handling rail borne ore cargo by maximizing utilization of limited land area through uniquely engineered and appropriately customized on-shore, high capacity, totally confined, concrete, elevated storage and blending system. The said system is to be located in an area adjacent to the Mechanical Ore Handling Plant (MOHP) and also provide for loading of barges.<br>
5<br><br>
The storage and retrieval system is a blend of new storage concept and state-of-the-art technology in feeding and retrieval conveyor technology. The system ushers in the technology of confined concrete elevated storage, which will use the vertical space efficiently on the same foot print area. A quantum jump of over 40% to 50% from existing throughput of MOHP is envisaged as the innovativeness of this invention allows to cater not only the ore carriers but also have capability to provide barge loading facility as feeder service for anchorage loading west of breakwater (WOB) or at the mooring dolphins either by ships own gear or by using trans-loaders.<br>
The said system has a sophisticated programmable gate mechanism, which draws ore and can homogenously blend cargoes from storage areas to get the desired export grade of the cargo.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
For the purpose of promoting an understanding of the principles of the invention, reference will now be made to the embodiment illustrated in the drawings and specific language will be used to describe the same. It will nevertheless be understood that no limitation of the scope of the invention is thereby intended, such alterations and further modifications in the illustrated device, and such further applications of the principles of the invention as illustrated therein being contemplated as would normally occur to one skilled in the art to which the invention relates.<br>
7<br><br>
With reference to the accompanying drawings and initially to figure 1 a birds eye view of the application of the invention to a port is depicted. As shown the incoming train or rake discharges its ore in the track hopper (2) from where tunnel conveyors (16) carry it to the high angle conveyors (3). The high angle conveyor or HAC lifts the ore to the height of the self unloading confined concrete elevated storage (1), hereinafter referred to as SUCCESS, and transfers the ore to a tripper conveyor (17). The tripper conveyor (17) in turn transfers the ore to the various compartments of success (1). The ore from the storage (1) can then be sent via conveyors to the barge loading point (20) or to the berth where the ship or oceangoing vessel is docked.<br>
With reference now to figure 2 the wagons or the BOBRN bottom discharge wagons (5) specially designed for transportation of bulk material with a high rate of discharge is shown. These wagons have a hopper type open body. The body rests on 2 bogies, each bogie having 2 axles under it. With the wagon in normal position, mechanically operated hopper doors (6) at the bottom enable rapid discharge of the wagon contents into a bunker below the rail level. Hopper door mechanism is automatically actuated by an electro-pneumatic arrangement when the wagon is in motion.<br>
The BOBRN bottom discharge wagons offer the following advantages: -Faster turn around due to high discharge rates. One hopper wagon can be discharged in 20 seconds. Taking into account unavoidable delays, for practical purposes one rake carrying 3200 tonnes can be discharged in less than 60 minutes.<br>
8<br><br>
With high discharge rate, loco bringing loaded rake can take empty rake<br>
back. This improves the cycle time and consequently availability of<br>
wagons in the system.<br>
No damage to wagons. Only maintenance of door mechanism is<br>
required.<br>
Uniform distribution of discharged Ore.<br>
Environmental pollution is minimal and can be easily contained.<br>
Figure 3 illustrates a schematic view of one such bottom discharge wagon (5) discharging ore onto the track hopper (2) with the hopper doors (6) at the bottom open. The rake or train can be in motion or may be halted over the track hopper. To increase the rate of discharge the train may be moved at a slow speed over the track hopper.<br>
Figure 4 illustrates a schematic of a track hopper (2) in accordance with the<br>
invention. The following description explains an embodiment of the track<br>
hopper and dimensions mentioned are not rigid but may be varied as per<br>
requirement. Track hopper is an underground box type concrete structure with<br>
approx 160 x 10 x 10 meters (L B H). The rail track (14) runs above the<br>
hopper (2) opening at the top on two longitudinal beams supported laterally by<br>
cross beams cast at regular intervals. Suspended from the top of the concrete<br>
box is a V shaped hopper (10) with both its top and bottom open and running<br>
under the track. The track hopper is located at straight portion of track. With<br>
this arrangement 15 wagons can be discharged at a time. The top and the<br>
bottom openings are 6m and 1.7 m in width. About 0.5m below the edge of the<br>
bottom opening, a 3.3m wide concrete table (11) has been provided to hold the<br>
unloaded iron ore. Paddle feeders (12) would scoop the unloaded iron ore<br>
through the gap between the table top and bottom of the V shape hopper.<br>
9<br><br>
The hopper is able to hold stock of 2.5 rakes carrying a pay load of 3230 MT and 2.25 rakes of 3770 MT pay load rake. The capacity is adequate to deal with bunched arrival of two in ore rakes within an interval of 20 -30 minutes, even if the evacuation of unloaded iron ore is not possible due to non-availability of a slot in the evacuation system.<br>
A high discharge rate enables faster movement over the unloading track hopper thereby reducing the unloading cycle time. Discharge rates up to 3 minutes per second have been achieved by providing door opening area nearly 40% of the maximum hopper top area. A BOBRN hopper wagon with a carrying capacity of 55.68 MT will thus get discharged in 19-20 seconds. Sudden opening of doors reduces the chances of arching and ensures complete and quick discharge of material. In the automatic mode the rake will get unloaded completely in a period of 13 minutes. Adding the time taken for approach as 4 minutes and starting reaction of 5 minutes, the minimum time taken to clear the hopper completely would be about 25 minutes to 30 minutes. In case the speed of the train becomes higher at 8 kilometers per hour, the time of full unloading of the rake will reduce to less than 5 minutes and the total cycle time would also reduce to about 17 to 22 minutes. In case of bunching, a second train arriving with in an interval of 30 minutes would get processed by the system without difficulty. In this mode the overall rake unloading cycle time would vary between 20-30 minutes depending upon the speed of transit of the rake.<br>
Wagons are discharged by automatic operation of door mechanism of the<br>
wagons in motion. Electronic Rail Weighbridges linked to computers are<br>
provided at suitable locations on the approach and exit sides of the track<br>
10<br><br>
hopper to automatically weigh and record the gross and tare weight of each wagon and print out the pay load of each wagon unloaded.<br>
A covered shed (13) is provided throughout the length of the track hopper. Atomized water spray means (15) is provided to prevent environmental pollution. Feeders and automatic operating gates will be provided to regulate transfer of discharged ore. Below the concrete table, at the bottom of the hopper, there are two tunnel conveyor belts (16) running in parallel complete with conveyor supporting structure, short supports, stringers, deck-plate, seal-plate etc. drive motors, drive units, pulleys, idlers, gravity take up structures, internal and external conveyor wipers, pull-chord switches, conveyor sway and zero speed switches, electro-hydraulic thruster brakes, etc. including all civil, structural and architectural works for conveyor gallery, gallery supporting trestles and their associated foundations. Four paddle (Rotary Plough) feeders complete with all electrical equipment, rails, supporting structures, end stops, cable reeling drums, trailing cables and necessary accessories. Two paddle feeders on each conveyor installed at the bottom of the track hopper scoop ore from track hopper and feed into the underground conveyor belts. The rated capacity of each paddle feeder is about 1,500 tph. The rated capacity of each conveyor in the ore handling plant is about 3000 tph. Ore handling plant shall have suitable arrangements for maintenance of the equipment for either on-stream or independently.<br>
Adequate number of ventilation equipment for ventilating track hopper,<br>
underground portion of conveyors, tunnels, underground portion of transfer<br>
points, complete with all mechanical, electrical, civil and structural works is<br>
provided. One main control tower complete with all required trenches etc shall<br>
be located at the entry or exit point of the track hopper to the western side.<br>
11<br><br>
Operation of track hopper mechanism i.e. paddle feeders, conveyors etc is capable of remote control from the control tower. Critical areas of operations like approach of train, paddle feeders, conveyor transfer points etc shall be capable of being monitored from control tower through closed circuit TV.<br>
Main advantages of the track hopper are as follows:<br>
Maintenance is easy as wear and tear components are less. Modifications to existing rail network is minimal. No congestion of rakes due to faster turnaround. No post- train examination will be necessary.<br>
Cargo evacuated by tunnel conveyors (16) under track hopper is transferred from the track hopper area, and then elevated to a height of 20 meters by using sandwich conveyor technology (HAC or C-type conveyor) (3). The tunnel conveyors (16) transferring ore to the high angle conveyor is shown in figure 5. This revolutionary technology is used whenever horizontal space for maintaining required gradient is scarce. Many self-unloader type ships have this as a standard elevating method from the bottom of cargo hold. It is used for any dry bulk material and can carry even 14,000 MT per hour. It is presently used in many installations abroad. It involves use of another conveyor in the elevated length running parallel to main conveyor causing the effect of sandwich. There is provision for varying the pressure and prevent spillage depending on type of cargo. Once elevated, cargo will be stockpiled in the confined concrete elevated storage system through a traveling tripper conveyor (17) that is fed by a conveyor from the HAC®.<br>
12<br><br>
The high angle conveyor is advantageous in that it offers cost reduction due to elimination of stacker. Due to elevated conveyor, there is an increase in the stockpile capacity in the same area as compared to stockpiling by stacker<br>
Figure 6 illustrates a perspective view of the process of transferring ore from the track hopper (2) to the self unloading confined concrete storage (1) through the high angle conveyors (3) in accordance with the invention.<br>
With reference now to figure 7 the tripper conveyor (17) loading the self-unloading confined concrete elevated storage (1) is illustrated. The self-unloading confined concrete elevated storage system has been conceptually engineered to obtain higher capacity in a given area. Entire stock will be placed in a self-unloading confined concrete elevated storage (1) having at least two and more preferably six or more compartments (21). Compartment formation is also structurally advantageous. In an embodiment of the invention, height of system is over 16 meters and with rectangular cross section and a hopper type arrangement at bottom. The storage capacity of the said system is more than double as compared to conventional stacking in the same footprint area. Stockpile will be approximately 450 meters in length and 30 meters effective width. This will give an approx capacity of over 3.5 lakhs MT. Top of confined concrete storage system will be provided with suitable covers to prevent dust pollution and ingress of rain water or moisture.<br>
As shown in figure 8 air canons (25) are provided to prevent cargo from<br>
sticking to the walls that in turn, are suitably lined with UHMWPP liners (26).<br>
Each compartment will be used for either different grade or user. Suitable<br>
automatically operated gates will be provided at the bottom to regulate cargo<br>
transfer to the tunnel conveyors (22) running below the bottom, which draw<br>
13<br><br>
the ore from the storage system by gravity. Employing skid shovels in each hold continuously provides cleanup of the storage hold as well as efficient feed to the cargo retrieval system. Sophisticated reliable control systems allow a single operator to offload cargo from the storage system including blending cargo from various holds as the need be.<br>
The main advantage of using the self unloading confined concrete elevated storage system are as follows:-<br>
Cost cutting due to elimination of stacker.<br>
Cost cutting due to elimination of reclaimer<br>
Total elimination of environmental pollution<br>
Convenient use of facility even during monsoon.<br>
Homogenized blending of cargo by synchronizing gates of different<br>
cargo holds<br>
Two shipping conveyors (22) of 4000 MT per hour rated capacity are provided under the self unloading confined concrete elevated storage system for evacuation of cargo through specially designed gate systems for shipment. These are reversible conveyors normally feeding conveyors of the MOHP. Proper control and communication is provided to comply with CCP commands. An added advantage here is that while one tunnel conveyor feeds conveyors with Goan ore from the MOHP the other tunnel conveyor can simultaneously load large capacity sea barges at the barges loading point (20).<br>
From western end of stockpile, one conveyor of rated capacity 2500 MT per<br>
Hour is provided. This is used for loading of high capacity sea barges whenever<br>
necessary and possible. With this facility it will be possible to up top any vessel<br>
in midstream.<br>
14<br><br>
With the storage system according to the present invention, the stockpile capacity of over 3.5 lakhs tones and operation during monsoon also, a throughput capacity of nearly 6 million per annum is available. Only constraint will be line capacity of Railways and MOHP capacity to load the vessels. However realistically 5 million tones per annum can be achieved. Hence, turnover will be 14 times stockpile capacity, a conservative turnover considering it is 365 day operation thereby removing the seasonality factor.<br>
While the invention has been illustrated and described in detail in the drawings and foregoing description, the same is to be considered as illustrative and not restrictive in character, it being understood that only the preferred embodiment has been shown and described and that all changes and modifications that come within the scope of the invention are desired to be protected.<br>
