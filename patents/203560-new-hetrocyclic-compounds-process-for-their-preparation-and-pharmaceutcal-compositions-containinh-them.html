The present invention relates to novel antidiabetic compounds, their tautomeric forms, their analogues, their derivatives, their stereoisomers, their polymorphs, their pharmaceutically acceptable salts, their pharmaceutically acceptable solvates and pharmaceutically acceptable compositions containing them. This invention particularly relates to novel azolidinedione compounds of the general formula (I), and their analogues, their derivatives, their tautomeric forms, their stereoisomers, flieir polymorphs, their pharmaceutically acceptable salts, pharmaceutically acceptable solvates and pharmaceutical compositions containing them.<br><br>
The present invention also relates to a procras for the pr^aration of the above said novel azolidinedione compounds, their analogues, their derivatives, their tautomeric forms, their stereoisomers, their polymorphs, their pharmaceutically acceptable salts, pharmaceutically acceptable solvates, and pharmaceutical compositions containing them.<br>
This invention also relates to novel intermediates, processes for preparing the intermediates and processes for using intermediates.<br>
The azolidinediones of the general formula (I) defined above of the present invention are useful for the treatment and / or prophylaxis of hyperlipidemia, hypercholesterolemia, hyperglycemia, osteoporosis, obraity, glucose intolerance, insulin resistance and also diseases or conditions in which insulin resistance is the underlying pathophysiological mechanism. Examples of these diseases and conditions are type II diabetes, impaired glucose tolerance, dyslipjdaemia, hypertension, coronary heart disease and other cardiovascular disorders including atherosclerosis. The azolidinediones of the formula (I) are useful for the treatment of insulin resistance associated with obesity and psoriasis. The azolidinediones of the formula (I) can also be used to treat diabetic complications and can be used for treatment and / or prophylaxis of other diseases and conditions such as polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), certain renal diseases including diabetic nephropathy,   glomerulonephritis,   glomerular   sclerosis,   nephrotic   syndrome,   hypertensive<br><br>
nephrosclerosis, end-stage renal diseases and microalbuminuria as well as certain eating disorders, as aldose reductase inhibitors and for improving cognitive functions in dementia.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
insulin resistance is the diminished ability of insulin to exert its biological action across a broad range of concentrations. In insulin resistance, the body secretes abnormally high amounts of insulin to compensate for this defect; failing which, the plasma glucose concentration inevitably rises and develops into diabetes. Among the developed countries, diabetes mellitus is a common problem  and  is  associated  with a variety  of abnoimalities  including obesity, hypertension, hyperlipidemia (J. Clin. Invest., (1985) 75 : 809 - 817; N. Engl. J. Med. (1987) 317 : 350 - 357 ; J. Clin. Endocrinol. Mefab., (1988) 66 : 580 - 583; J. Clin. Invest., (1975) 68 : 957 -969) and other renal complications (See Patent Application No. WO 95/21608).   It is now increasingly being recognized that insulin resistance and relative hyperinsulinemia have a contributory role in obesity, hypertension, atherosclerosis and type 2 diabetes mellitus.   The association of insulin resistance with obesity, hypertension and angina has been described as a syndrome having insulin resistance as the centra! pathogenic link-Syndrome-X.   In addition, polycystic  ovarian  syndrome  (Patent  Application  No.   WO   95/07697),  psoriasis  (Patent Application No. WO 95/35108), dementia (Behavioral Brain Research (1996) 75 ; 1 - I 1) etc. may also have insulin resistance as a central pathogenic feature. Recently, it has also been r^orted that insulin sensitizers improve the bone mineral density and thus may be useful for the treatment of osteoporosis (EP-783888).<br>
A number of molecular defects have been associated with insulin resistance. These include reduced expression of insulin receptors on the plasma membrane of insulin responsive cells and alterations in the signal transduction pathways that become activated after insulin binds to its receptor including glucose transport and glycogen synthesis.<br>
Since defective insulin action is thought to be more important than failure of insulin secretion in the development of non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus and other related complications, this raises doubts about the intrinsic suitability of antidiabetic treatment that is based entirely upon stimulation of insulin release. Recently, Takeda has developed a new class of compoimds which are the derivatives of 5-(4-alkoxybenzyl)-2,4-thiazolidinediones of the formula (II) (Ref Chem. Pharm. Bull. 1982, 30, 3580-3600). In the formula (11), V represents substituted or unsubstituted divalent aromatic group B represents a sulfur atom or an oxygen atom and U represents various groups which have been reported in various patent documents.<br><br><br>
By way of examples, U may represent the following groups;<br>
(i) a group of the formula (Ha) where R" is hydrogen or hydrocarbon residue or heterocyclic residue which may each be substituted, R^ is hydrogen or a lower alkyl which may be substituted by hydroxy group, X is an oxygen or sulphur atom, Z is a hydroxylated methylene or a carbonyl, m is 0 or I, n is an integer of 1-3. These compounds have been disclosed in the European Patent Application No. 0 177 353<br><br>
An example of these compounds is shown in formula (lib)<br><br>
(ii) a group of the formula (lie) wherein R" and R^ are the same or differenl and each represents hydrogen or Ci-Cj alkyl, R" rqjresents hydrogen, acyl group, a (Ci-C6) alkoxycaibwiyl group or aralkyloxycarixmyl group, R* - R" are same or different and each r^resent hydrogen, Ct -C5 alkyl or C| -Cj alkoxy or R*. R^ together represent C1-C4 alkenedioxy group, n is 1, 2, or 3, W reprcsente CH2, CO, CHOR^ group in which R^ represents any one of the items or groups defined for R^ and may be the same or different from R\ These compounds are disclosed in the European Patent Application No. 0 139421.<br><br>
An example of these compounds is shown in (lid)<br><br><br>
iii) A group of formula (lie) where A" represents substituted or uasubstituted aromatic heterocyclic group, R" represents a hydrogen atom, alkyl group, acyl group, an aralkyl group wherein the aryl moiety may be substituted or unsubstituted, or a substituted or unsubstituted aryl group, n represents an integer in the range from 2 to 6, These compounds are disclosed in European Patent No. 0 306 228.<br><br>
An example of this compound is shown in formula (Ilf)<br><br>
iv) A group of fonnula (Ilg) where Y represents N or CR^ R", R^ R^ R** and R* represents hydrogen, halogen, alkyl and tiie like and R^ represents hydrogen, alkyl, aryl and the like, n represents an integer of 0 to 3. These compounds are disclosed in European Patent j^pHcation No. 0 604 983.    ^<br><br><br>
V)       a group of formula (Hi), where R is (C-Ce) alkyl groups, cycloalkyi group, furyl. thienyl, substituted or unsubstituted phenyl group, X is hydrogen, methyl, methoxy, chlord or Huoro. These compounds have been disclosed in the US patent no. 5 037 842.<br><br>
Some of the above referenced hitherto known antidiabetic compounds seem to possess bone marrow depression, liver and cardiac toxicities and modest potency and consequently, their regular use for the treatment and control of diabetes is becoming limited and restricted.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>

The compound of the formula (I) as defmed above are clinically administered to mammals, including man, via either oral or parenteral routes. Administration by the oral route is preferred, being more convenient and avoiding the possible pain and irritation of injection. However, in circumstances where the patient carmot swallow the medication, or absorption following oral administration is impaired, as by disease or other abnormality, it is essential that the drug be administered parenteraily. By either route, the dosage is in the range of about 0.10 mg to about 200 mg / kg body weight of the subject per day or preferably about 0.10 iftg to about 30 mg / kg body weight per day administered singly or as a divided dose. However, the optimum dosage for the individual subject being treated will be determined by the person responsible for treatment, generally smaller doses being administered initially and thereafter increments made to determine the most suitable dosage.<br>
Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable carriers include solid fillers or diluents and sterile aqueous or organic solutions. The active compound will be present in such pharmaceutical compositions in the amounts sufficient to provide the desired dosage in the range as described above. Thus, for oral administration, the compounds can be combined with a suitable solid or liquid carrier or diluent to form capsules, tablets, powders^ syrups, solutions, suspensions and the like. The pharmaceutical compositions, may, if desired, contain additional components such as flavourants, sweeteners, excipients and the like. For parenteral administration, the compounds can be combined with sterile aqueous or organic media to form injectable solutions or suspensions. For example, solutions in sesame or peanut oil, aqueous propylene glycol and the like can be used, as well as aqueous solutions of water-soluble pharmaceutically-acceplable acid<br><br>
addition salts or salts with base of the compounds. The injectable solutions prepared in this manner can then be administered intravenously, intraperitoneally, subcutaneousiy, or intramuscularly, with intramuscular administration being preferred in humans.<br>

Mutation in colonies of laboratory animals and different sensitiyities to dietary regimens have made the development of animal models with non-insulin dependent diabetes associated with obesity and insulin resistance possible. Genetic models such as db/db and ob/ob (See Diabetes, (1982) 31(1)<br><br>
: I- 6) in mice and. fa/fa and zucker rats have been developed by the various laboratories for understanding the pathophysiology of disease and testing the efficacy of new antidiabetic compounds (Diabetes, (1983) 32: 830-838 ; Annu. Rep. Sankyo Res. Lab. (1994) 46 ; 1-57). The "homozygous animals. C57 BL/KsJ-db/db mice developed by Jackson Laboratory, US, are obese, hyperglycemic, hyperinsulinemic and insulin resistant (J. Clin. Invest., (1990) 85 : 962-967), whereas heterozygous are lean and normoglycemic. In db/db model, mouse progressively develops insulinopenia with age, a feature commonly observed in late stages of human type II diabetes when blood sugar levels are insufficiently controlled. The state of pancreas and its course vary according to the models. Since this model resembles that of type II diabetes mellitus, the compounds of the present invention were tested for blood sugar and triglycerides lowering activities.<br>
The compounds of the present invention showed blood sugar and triglycerides lowering activities through improved insulin resistance. This was demonstrated by the following in vivo experiments.<br>
Male C57BL/KsJ-db/db mice of 8 to 14 weeks age, having body weight range of 35 to 60 grams, procured from the Jackson Laboraotory, USA, were used in the experiment. The mice were provided with standard feed (National Institute of Nutrition, Hyderabad, India) and acidified water, ad libitum. The animals having more than 300 mg / dl blood sugar were used for testing. TTie number of ^imals in each group was 4.<br>
The random blood sugar and triglyceride levels were measured by collecting blood (100 pi) through orbital sinus, using heparinised capillary in tubes containing EDTA which was centrifoged to obtain plasma. The plasma glucose and triglycerides levels were measured spectrometrically, by glucose oxidase and glycerol-3-P04 oxidase/peroxidase enzyme (Dr. Reddy"s Lab. Diagnostic Division Kits, Hyderabad, India) methods respectively. On 6th day the blood samplra were collected one hour after administration of test compounds / vehicle for assessing the biological activity.<br>
Test corr^ounds were suspended on 0.25 % carboxymethyl cellulose and administered to test group at a dose of 10 mg to 100 mg / kg through oral gavage daily for 6 days. The control group received vehicle (dose 10 ml / kg). Troglitazone (100 mg / kg, daily dose) was used as a standard drug which showed 28 % reduction in random blood sugar level on 6th day.<br>
The blood sugar and triglycerides lowering activities of the test compound was calculated according to the formula;<br><br><br><br>
The experimental results from the db/db mice suggest that the novel compounds of the present invention also possess therapeutic utility as a prophylactic or regular treatment for obesity, cardiovascular disorders such as hypertension, hyperlipidaemia and other diseases; as it is known from the literature that such diseases are interrelated to each other.<br><br><br>
