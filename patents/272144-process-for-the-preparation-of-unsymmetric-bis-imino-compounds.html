Process for the preparation of unsymmetric bis(imino) compounds<br>
Description<br>
The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of unsymmetric bis(imino) compounds.<br>
The use of metallocene catalysts in the polymerization of unsaturated compounds shows a great influence on the preparation of polyolefins, since it opens up access to novel polyolefinic materials or to materials having improved properties. There is therefore great interest in the development of novel families of catalysts for the polymerization of unsaturated compounds in order to achieve an even better control over the properties of polyolefins or further novel products.<br>
In particular, the use of transition metal catalysts with late transition metals is of interest because of their property of tolerating heteroatom functionalities. Transition metal catalysts of late transition metals which are suitable for the polymerization of unsaturated compounds are known from the prior art. 1,2-Diiminenickel and 2,6-bis(imino)pyridyliron complexes have proved to be particularly suitable here.<br>
Unsymmetric 2,6-bis(imino)pyridyl compounds which carry two different imino groups are conventionally prepared via a first condensation of the corresponding diketo compounds with a primary amine. The intermediate product obtained is then reacted with a second primary amine which differs from the first. In the first step, in addition to the monoimine, the symmetric diimine product is also formed, so that the yield of the intermediate product is usually very low. The yield of monoimine intermediate product drops in particular if<br><br>
primary amines having, electron-withdrawing groups or groups which cause little steric hindrance are used.<br>
WO 98/27124 discloses the synthesis of unsymmetric 2,6-bis(imino)pyridyl compounds from the corresponding diketo compounds and anilines in toluene with the addition of catalytic amounts of toluenesulfonic acid, via monoimine intermediate products. Monoimine intermediate products having electron-withdrawing substituents are not disclosed. The preparation of unsymmetric 2,6-bis(imino)pyridyl compounds with anilines which carry an electron-withdrawing substituent in the ortho position gives only low yields of unsymmetric product in the second synthesis step.<br>
The object of the present invention is to provide an improved process for the synthesis of unsymmetric bis(imino) compounds with which primary amines having electron-withdrawing substituents or substituents which cause little steric hindrance can also be converted into the corresponding monoimine compounds with better yields. These are particularly suitable starting materials for the synthesis of unsymmetric diimine compounds, and lead to higher yields of unsymmetric product. The unsymmetric diimine compounds having electron-withdrawing substituents show particularly high activities in the polymerization of alpha-olefins.<br>
A  process  has  accordingly  been  found  for  the preparation of monoimine compounds of the formula I<br><br><br>

It has proved advantageous, in particular in the preparation of diimine compounds having halogen-containing substituents on the aniline, to carry out the synthesis under an inert gas atmosphere, such as nitrogen or argon.<br>
The reaction is in general carried out at 18 to 150°C, preferably at 30 to 110°C, and particularly preferably at 50 to 90°C. The reaction time is conventionally between 30 minutes and 15 days, preferably between 5 hours and 5 days, particularly preferably between 8 hours and 3 days.<br>
Working up is carried out in the conventional manner, e.g. by filtering off the product before or after removal of the solvent in vacuo. Purification of the product obtained can then be carried out by the conventional routes, such as, for example, by means of chromatography or recrystallization. An advantage of the reaction in aliphatic, non-aromatic solvents is the purity of the product obtained directly after filtration, which renders further working up unnecessary.<br>
The process .according to the invention is particularly suitable for anilines of the formula II having at least one halogen atom in the ortho position. Such anilines result in only low yields of monoimine compound in toluene or alcohol.<br><br>

According to the invention, unsymmetric iron complexes are understood as meaning those compounds which comprise the unsymmetric bis(imino) compounds according to the invention having at least two imino groups, the aryl radicals of which are not substituted in an identical manner. This relates to the substituents or the substitution pattern of the substituents, under the theoretical assumption that the aryl radicals can rotate freely.<br>
The ligands X result e.g. from the choice of the corresponding iron starting compounds which are used for the synthesis of the iron complexes, but can also additionally be varied subsequently. Possible ligands X*^ are, in particular, the halogens, such as fluorine, chlorine, bromine or iodine, and among these in particular chlorine and bromine. Alkyl radicals, such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, vinyl, allyl, phenyl or benzyl, are also ligands X which can be used. Further ligands X which may be mentioned only by way of example and in no way conclusively are trif luoroacetate, BF4~', PFe" and weakly or non-coordinating anions (see e.g. S. Strauss in Chem. Rev. 1993, 93, 927-942), such as B(C6F5)4~. Amides, alcoholates, sulfonates, carboxylates and p-diketonates, in particular R^^-CO-C (R^^)-CO-R^^, are also particularly suitable ligands X. Some of these substituted ligands X are particularly preferably used,<br><br>
since they are obtainable from cheap and easily accessible starting substances. A particularly preferred embodiment thus exists if X represents dimethylamide, methanolate, ethanolate, isopropanolate, phenolate, naphtholate, triflate, p-toluene sulfonate, acetate or acetyl acetonate.<br>
By varying the radicals R'"^ e.g. physical properties, such as solubility, can be finely adjusted. Possible C-organic substituents R^^ are, for example, the following: Ci-C2o-alkyl, wherein the alkyl can be linear or branched, such as e.g. methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, iso-propyl, n-butyl, iso-butyl, tert-butyl, n-pentyl, n-hexyl, n-heptyl, n-octyl, n-nonyl, n-decyl or n-dodecyl, 5- to 7-membered cycloalkyl, which in its turn can carry a Cg-Cio-aryl group as a substituent, such as e.g. cyclopropane, cyclobutane, cyclopentane, cyclohexane, cycloheptane, cyclooctane, cyclononane or cyclododecane, C2-C2o-alkenyl, wherein the alkenyl can be linear, cyclic or branched and the double bond can be internal or terminal, such as e.g. vinyl, 1-allyl, 2-allyl, 3-allyl, butenyl, pentenyl, hexenyl, cyclopentenyl, cyclohexenyl, cyclooctenyl or cyclooctadienyl, C6-C2o-aryl, wherein the aryl radical can be substituted by further alkyl groups and/or N- or 0-containing radicals, such as e.g. phenyl, naphthyl, biphenyl, anthranyl, o-, m-, p-methylphenyl, 2,3-, 2,4-, 2,5- or 2,6-dimethylphenyl, 2,3,4-, 2,3,5-, 2,3,6-, 2,4,5-, 2,4,6- or 3,4,5-trimethylphenyl, 2-methoxyphenyl or 2-N,N-dimethylaminophenyl, or arylalkyl, wherein the arylalkyl can be substituted by further alkyl groups, such as e.g. benzyl, o-, m-, p-methylbenzyl or 1- or 2-ethylphenyl, wherein if appropriate also two R""-^ can be bonded to form a 5- or 6-membered ring and the organic radicals R'"^ can also be substituted by halogens, such as e.g. fluorine, chlorine or bromine. As Si-organic substituents SiR'^'^s, uhe same radicals as listed above in more detail for R^^<br><br>
are possible for R'"^, if appropriate it also being possible for two R"'^ to be bonded to form a 5- or 6-membered ring, such as e.g. trimethylsilyl, triethylsilyl, butyldimethylsilyl, tributylsilyl, triallylsilyl, triphenylsilyl or dimethylphenylsilyl. Ci-Cio-alkyl, such as methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, n-butyl, tert-butyl, n-pentyl, n-hexyl, n-heptyl and n-octyl, as well as vinyl, allyl, benzyl and phenyl are preferably used as radicals R"^^.<br>
The number s of ligands X depends on the oxidation level of the iron. The number s therefore cannot be stated in general terms. The oxidation level of the iron in catalytically active complexes is usually known to the person skilled in the art. However, complexes in which the oxidation level does not correspond to that of the active catalyst can also ■ be employed. Such complexes can then be reduced or oxidized accordingly by suitable activators. Iron complexes in the oxidation level +3 or +2 are preferably used.<br>
D is a neutral- donor, in particular a neutral Lewis base or Lewis acid, such as, for example, amines, alcohols, ethers, ketones, aldehydes, esters, sulfides or phosphines, which can be bonded with the iron center or can still be contained in the complex as residual solvent from the preparation of the iron complexes.<br>
The number t of the ligands D can be a number between 0 and 4 and often depends on the solvent in which the iron complex is prepared and on how long the resulting complexes are dried, and therefore also may denote a number which is not an integer, such as 0.5 or 1.5. In particular, t is 0, 1 to 2.<br>

With the processes according to the invention, in particular, anilines having electron-withdrawing substituents can also be converted into the corresponding monoimine compounds in good yields. Furthermore, the working up of the monoimine compounds obtained is considerably simpler, and filtering off of the precipitate formed, which usually comprises exclusively the monoimine compound, is often sufficient.<br>
The monoimine compounds la are thermodynamically very stable and can be reacted with further aniline to give the unsymmetric bisimine compounds IV. If monoimine compounds which are not substituted by electron-withdrawing radicals in the ortho position are used as starting substances, a further reaction with further aniline usually leads to mixtures of various symmetric and unsymmetric bisimine compounds.<br>
The unsymmetric iron complexes V show very high polymerization activities. They furthermore show narrow<br><br>
molar mass distributions and molecular weights in a range which is favorable for many uses.<br>
The iron complexes V according to the invention can be used by themselves or with further components as a catalyst system for the olefin polymerization. Catalyst systems for olefin polymerization comprising at least one iron complex of the formula V, optionally an organic or inorganic support, optionally one or more activators, optionally one or more metal compounds of group 1, 2 or 13 of the periodic table and optionally further catalysts suitable for olefin polymerization have therefore furthermore been found.<br>
The iron complex V in itself in some cases has only a low polymerization activity, and can then be brought into contact with one or more activators in order to be able to display a good polymerization activity. The catalyst system therefore furthermore optionally comprises one or more activating compounds, preferably one or two activating compounds.<br>
The activator or the activators can in each case be employed in any desired amounts, based on the iron complex V, and they are preferably employed in an excess or in stoichiometric amounts. The amount of activating compound (s) to be used depends on the nature of the activator. The molar ratio of iron complex V to activating compound is conventionally in the range of from 1:0.1 to 1:10,000, preferably from 1:1 to 1:2000.<br>
Suitable activators are e.g. compounds of the type of an aluminoxane, a strong neutral Lewis acid, an ionic compound having a Lewis acid cation or an ionic compound  having  a  Bronsted  acid  as  a  cation.<br>
The compounds described in WO 00/31090, for example, can be employed as alum.inoxanes. Open-chain or cyclic<br><br>

Methylaluminoxane   is aluminoxane compound.<br><br>
particularly<br><br>
suitable<br><br>
The preparation of these oligomeric aluminoxane compounds is conventionally carried out by controlled reaction of a solution of trialkylaluminum, in particular trimethylaluminum, with water. As a rule, the oligomeric aluminoxane compounds obtained in this reaction are in the form of mixtures of both linear and cyclic chain molecules of different length, so that I is to be regarded as a mean value. The aluminoxane compounds can also be in the form of a mixture with other metal-alkyls, conventionally with aluminum-alkyls. Aluminoxane formulations which are suitable as activators are commercially obtainable.<br>
Instead of the aluminoxane compounds of the general formulae (X) or (XI), modified aluminoxanes in which the hydrocarbon radicals are in some cases replaced by hydrogen atoms or alkoxy,  aryloxy,  siloxy or amide<br><br>
radicals can furthermore also be employed as the activator.<br>
It has proved advantageous to use the iron complex V and the aluminoxane compounds in amounts such that the atomic ratio between aluminum from the aluminoxane compounds, including aluminum-alkyl still contained therein, and the iron from the iron complex V is conventionally in the range of from 1:1 to 2000:1, preferably from 10:1 to 500:1, and in particular in the range of from 20:1 to 400:1.<br>
A further type of suitable activators are the so-called hydroxyaluminoxanes. These can be prepared, for example,- by addition of from 0.5 to 1.2 equivalents of water, preferably 0.8 to 1.2 equivalents of water per equivalent of aluminum to an alkylaluminum compound, in particular triisobutylaluminum, at low temperatures, conventionally below 0°C. Such compounds and their use in olefin polymerization are described, for example, in WO 00/24787. The atomic ratio between aluminum from the hydroxyaluminoxane compound and the iron from the iron complex V is conventionally in the range of from 1:1 to 100:1, preferably from 10:1 to 50:1, and in particular in the range of from 20:1 to 40:1.<br>

tris(3,5-difluorophenyl)borane or tris(3,4,5-<br>
trifluorophenyl)borane, are particularly preferred.<br>
Tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane is preferably used.<br>
Suitable activators are preferably prepared from the reaction of aluminum or boron compounds of the formula (XII) with water, alcohols, phenol derivatives, thiophenol derivatives or aniline derivatives, the halogenated, and especially the perfluorinated alcohols and phenols being of importance in particular. Examples of particularly suitable compounds are pentafluorophenol, 1,1-bis-(pentafluorophenyl)methanol or 4-hydroxy-2,2',3,3',4',5,5',6,6' -nonafluorobiphenyl.

Salts with non-coordinating anions can also be prepared by bringing together a boron or aluminum compound, e.g. an aluminum-alkyl, with a second compound which can link two or more boron or aluminum atoms by reaction, e.g. water, and a third compound which forms an ionizing ionic compound with the boron compound or aluminum compound, e.g. triphenylchloromethane, or optionally a base, preferably an organic nitrogen-containing base, such as, for example, an amine, an aniline derivative or a nitrogen heterocyclyl. A fourth compound, which likewise reacts with the boron compound or aluminum compound, e.g. pentafluorophenol, can additionally be added.<br><br>
Ionic compounds having Bronsted acids as cations preferably likewise have non-coordinating counterions. Protonated amine or aniline derivatives are preferred in particular as the Bronsted acid. Preferred cations are N,N-dimethylanilinium, N,N-dimethylcyclo-hexylammonium and N, N-dimethylbenzylammonium as well as derivatives of the two mentioned last.<br>
Compounds having anionic boron heterocyclyls, such as are described in WO 9736937, are also suitable as activators, in particular dimethylanilinium boratabenzenes or trityl boratabenzenes<br>
Preferred ionic activators comprise borates which carry at least two perfluorinated aryl radicals. Particularly preferred compounds are N,N-dimethylanilinium tetrakis-(pentafluorophenyl)borate, and especially N,N-dimethyl-cyclohexylaminonium tetrakis (pentafluorophenyl) borate, N,N-dimethylbenzylammonium tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)-borate or trityl tetrakispentafluorophenylborate.<br>
It is also possible for two or more borate anions to be bonded with one another, as in the dianion [(C6F5)2B-CeF^-B (CeFs) 2] ^'/ or the borate anion can be bonded via a bridge with a suitable functional group on the support surface.<br>
Further suitable activators are listed in WO 00/31090.<br>
The amount of strong, neutral Lewis acids, ionic compounds having Lewis acid cations or ionic compounds having Bronsted acids as cations is preferably 0.1 to 20 equivalents, preferably 1 to 10 equivalents, and particularly preferably 1 to 2 equivalents, based on the iron complex V.<br>
Suitable activators are also boron-aluminum compounds, such  as  di [bis {peni:ailuorophenylboroxy) ] methylalane .<br><br>
Corresponding boron-aluminum compounds are disclosed, for example, in WO 99/06414.<br>
Mixtures of all the abovementioned activating compounds can also be employed. Preferred mixtures comprise aluminoxanes, in particular methylaluminoxane, and an ionic compound, in particular one which comprises the tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borate anion, and/or a strong neutral Lewis acid, in particular tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane or a boroxine.<br>
Preferably, the iron complex V and also the activator (s) ■ are employed in a solvent, aromatic hydrocarbons having 6 to 20 C atoms, in particular xylenes, toluene, pentane, hexane, heptane or mixtures of these, being preferred.<br>
There is furthermore the possibility of employing an activator which can simultaneously be used as the support. Such systems are obtained, for example, from an inorganic oxide treated with zirconium alkoxide, and subsequent chlorination, e.g. with carbon tetrachloride. The preparation of such systems is described, for example, in WO 01/41920.<br>
In particular, the combinations of the preferred embodiments of the activators with the preferred embodiments of the iron complexes V are preferred.<br>
An aluminoxane is preferably employed as the activator for the iron complexes V. The combination of salt-like compounds of the cation of the general formula (XIII), in particular N, N-dimethylanilinium tetrakis-(pentafluorophenyl)borate, N, N-dimethylcyclohexyl-ammonium tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borate, N,N-dimethylbenzylammonium tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)-borate or trityl tetrakispentafluorophenylborate, as the activator for the iron complex V, in particular in<br><br>
combination  with  an  aluminoxane  is   rur-cnermore<br>
preferred.<br>
So that the iron complex V can be employed in the polymerization process in the gas phase or in suspension, it is often of advantage for the complexes to be employed in the form of a solid, i.e. for them to be applied to a solid support. The supported complexes furthermore have a high productivity. The iron complexes V can therefore optionally also be immobilized on an organic or inorganic support and used in the polymerization in the supported form. As a result, for example, reactor deposits can be avoided and the polymer morphology can be controlled. Support materials which are preferably used are silica gel, magnesium chloride, aluminum oxide, mesoporous materials, aluminosilicates, hydrotalcites and organic polymers, such as polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene, polytetrafluoroethylene or polymers functionalized with polar groups, such as, for example, copolymers of ethene and acrylate, acrolein or vinyl acetate.<br>
A catalyst system comprising at least one iron complex V, at least one activator and at least one support component is particularly preferred.<br>
Preferably, for the preparation of the catalyst systems according to the invention, the iron complex V and/or the activator are fixed on the support by physisorption or also by a chemical reaction, which means covalent bonding of the components with reactive groups of the support surface.<br>
In principle, any desired sequence is possible for bringing together the support component, rhe iron complex V and the activator. After the individual process steps, the various intermediate stages can be<br><br>
washed with suitable inert solvents, such as e.g. aliphatic or aromatic hydrocarbons.<br>
The iron complex V and the activator can be fixed independently of one another, e.g. successively or simultaneously. Thus, the support component can be' brought into contact first with the activator or activators or also first with the iron complex V. Preactivation of the iron complex V with one or more activators before thorough mixing with the support is also possible. In one possible embodiment, the iron complex V can also be prepared in the presence of the support material. A further type of immobilization is also prepolymerization of the catalyst system with or without prior application to a support.<br>
The immobilization is as a rule carried out in an inert solvent, which can be filtered off or evaporated after the immobilization. After the individual process steps, the solid catalyst system can be washed with suitable inert solvents, such as e.g. aliphatic or aromatic hydrocarbons, and dried. However, it is also possible to use the still moist, supported catalyst system.<br>
In a preferred form of the preparation of the supported catalyst system, at least one iron complex V is brought into contact with at least one activator and the mixture is then mixed with the dehydrated or inertized support material. Preferably, the resulting supported catalyst system is dried, in order to ensure that all or most of the solvent is removed from the pores of the support material. The supported catalyst is preferably obtained as a free-flowing powder. Examples of the industrial realization of the above process are described in WO 96/00243, WO 98/40419 or WO 00/05277. A further preferred embodiment is first to produce the activator on the support component or to apply it to<br><br>
this and subsequently to bring this supported compound into contact with the iron complex V.<br>
Finely divided supports, which can be any desired organic or inorganic solid, are preferably employed as the support component. In particular, the support component can be a porous support, such as talc, a laminar silicate, such as montmorillonite or mica, an inorganic oxide or a finely divided polymer powder (e.g. polyolefin or polymer functionalized with polar groups).<br>
The support materials used preferably have a specific surface area in the range of from 10 to 1000 m^/g, a pore volume in the range of from 0.1 to 5 ml/g and an average particle size of from 1 to 500 iim. Supports having a specific surface area in the range of from 50 to 700 m^/g, a pore volume in the range between 0.4 and 3.5 ml/g and an average particle size in the range of from 5 to 350 ]im are preferred. Supports having a specific surface area in the range of from 200 to 550 m^/g, a pore volume in the range between 0.5 to 3.0 ml/g and an average particle size of from 10 to 150 ]im are particularly preferred.<br>
The iron complex V is preferably applied in an amount such that the concentration of iron from the iron complex V in the finished catalyst system is 1 to 200 limol, preferably 5 to 100 |imol, and particularly preferably 10 to 70 lamol per g of finished catalyst system.<br>
The inorganic support can be subjected to a heat treatment, e.g. to remove adsorbed water. Such a drying treatment is as a rule carried out at temperatures in the range of from 50 to 1000°C, preferably from 100 to 600°C, drying at 100 to 200°C preferably being carried out in vacuo and/or under an inert gas blanket (e.g.<br><br>
nitrogen), or the inorganic support can be calcined at<br>
temperatures  of  from  200  to  1000°C  in  order  to<br>
establish, if appropriate, the desired structure of the<br>
solid  and/or  the  desired  OH  concentration  on  the<br>
urface. The support can also be treated chemically, it<br>
ieing possible to employ conventional drying agents,<br>
uch  as  metal-alkyls,  preferably  aluminum-alkyls,<br>
:hlorosilanes  or  SiCl4,  but  also  methylalumoxane.<br>
:orresponding  treatment  methods  are  described,  for<br>
!xample, in WO 00/31090.<br>
.'he inorganic support material can also be modified :hemically. For example, treatment of silica gel with JH4SiF6 or other fluorinating agents leads to iluorination of the silica gel surface, or treatment of silica gels with silanes which compirse nitrogen-, -luorine- or sulfur-containing groups leads to :orrespondingly modified silica gel surfaces.<br>
Drganic support materials, such as finely divided polyolefin powders (e.g. polyethylene, polypropylene or polystyrene) can also be used and should preferably likewise be freed from adhering moisture, solvent residues or other impurities by appropriate purification and drying operations before use. It is also possible to employ functionalized polymer supports, e.g. based on polystyrene, polyethylene, polypropylene or polybutylene, via the functional groups of which, for example ammonium or hydroxyl groups, at least one of the catalyst components can be fixed. Polymer blends can also be used.<br>
Suitable inorganic oxides as the support component are to be found in groups 2, 3, 4, 5, 13, 14, 15 and 16 of the periodic table of the elements. Examples of oxides which are preferred as the support include silicon dioxide, aluminum oxide and mixed oxides of the elements  calcium,  aluminum,  silicon,  magnesium  or<br><br>
titanium,  as  well  as  corresponding	oxide mixtures.<br>
Other  inorganic  oxides,  which  can	be  employed  by<br>
themselves or in combination with the	preferred oxidic<br>
supports mentioned last, are e.g. MgO,	CaO, AIPO4, Zr02,<br>
Ti02, B2O3 or mixtures thereof.<br>
Further preferred inorganic support materials are inorganic halide, such as MgCl2, or carbonates, such as e.g. Na2C03, K2CO3, CaCOs or MgCOs, sulfates, such as Na2S04, Al2(S04)3 or BaS04, and nitrates, such as e.g. KNO3, Mg(N03)2. or A1(N03)3.<br>
Silica gels are preferably used as solid support materials for catalysts for the olefin polymerization, since particles which are suitable in size and structure as a support for the olefin polymerization can be prepared from this material. In this context, spray-dried silica gels, which are spherical agglomerate of smaller granular particles, the so-called primary particles, have proved to be particularly appropriate. The silica gels can be dried and/or calcined here before their use.<br>
Hydrotalcites and calcined hydrotalcites are likewise preferred supports. In mineralogy, a natural mineral having the ideal formula<br>
Mg6Al2(OH)i6C03 " 4 H2O<br>
the structure of which is derived from that of brucite Mg(0H)2, is called hydrotalcite. Brucite crystallizes in a layered structure with the metal ions in octahedral voids between two layers of densely packed hydroxyl ions, only every second layer of the octahedral voids being occupied. In hydrotalcite, some magnesium ions are replaced by aluminum ions, as a result of which the layer package acquires a positive charge.  This  is  compensated by  the  anions  in  the<br><br>
intermediate layers together with water of crystallization.<br>
Corresponding layered structures are found not only in magnesium-aluminum hydroxides, but generally in mixed metal hydroxides built up in the form of layers, of the general formula<br>
M(II)2x^^M(III)2^^(OH)4&gt;c+4 ■ A2/n"" '  2 HjO<br>
in which M{II) is a divalent metal, such as Mg, Zn, Cu, Ni, Co, Mn, Ca and/or Fe, and M(III) is a trivalent metal, such as Al, Fe, Co, Mn, La, Ce and/or Cr, x represents numbers from 0.5 to 10 in steps of 0.5, A represents an interstitial anion and n represents the charge of the interstitial anion, which can be from 1 to 8, conventionally from 1 to 4, and z is an integer from 1 to 6, in particular from 2 to 4. Possible interstitial anions are organic anions, such as alcoholate anions, alkyl ether sulfates, aryl ether sulfates or glycol ether sulfates, inorganic anions, such as, in particular, carbonate, bicarbonate, nitrate, chloride, sulfate or B(0H)4"'? or polyoxometal anions, such as Mo7024^~ or VxoOas^"- However, there can also be a mixture of several such anions.<br>
All mixed metal hydroxides built up in such a manner in the form of layers should accordingly be understood as hydrotalcites in the context of the present invention.<br>
The so-called calcined hydrotalcites can be prepared from hydrotalcites by calcining, i.e. heating, as a result of which, inter alia, the desired content of hydroxyl groups can be established. The structure of the crystal construction furthermore also changes. The preparation of the calcined hydrotalcites employed according to the invention is conventionally carried out at temperatures above 180°C. Calcining for a period<br><br>
of time of from 3 to 24 hours at temperatures of from 250°C to 1000°C and in particular from 400°C to 700°C is preferred. It is possible to simultaneously pass over air or an inert gas or to apply a vacuum.<br>
On heating, the natural or synthetic hydrotalcites initially release water, i.e. drying takes place. On further heating, the actual calcining, the metal hydroxides are converted into the metal oxides by hydroxyl groups and interstitial anions being split off, it also being possible for the calcined hydrotalcites still to comprise OH groups or interstitial anions, such as carbonate. The loss on ignition is a measure of this. This is the weight loss which a sample suffers when heated in two steps, first for 30 min at 200°C in a drying cabinet and then for 1 hour at 950°C in a muffle oven.<br>
The calcined hydrotalcites employed as a component are thus mixed oxides of the di- and trivalent metals M(II) and M(III), wherein the molar ratio of M(II) to M(III) is as a rule in the range of from 0.5 to 10, preferably from 0.75 to 8, and in particular from 1 to 4. Conventional amounts of impurities, for example of Si, Fe, Na, Ca or Ti, and also chlorides and sulfates, can furthermore also be present.<br>
Preferred calcined hydrotalcites are mixed oxides in which M{II) is magnesium and M(III) is aluminum. Corresponding aluminum-magnesium mixed oxides are obtainable from Condea Chemie GmbH (now Sasol Chemie), Hamburg under the trade name Puralox Mg.<br>
Calcined hydrotalcites in which the structural conversion is virtually or completely concluded are furthermore preferred. A calcining, i.e. a conversion of the structure, can be detected, for example, from X-ray diffractograms.<br><br>
The hydrotalcites, calcined hydrotalcites or silica gels employed are as a rule employed as finely divided powders having an average particle diameter D50 of from 5 to 200 iim, preferably from 10 to 150 ym, particularly preferably from 15 to 100 ]im, and in particular from 20 to 70 um, and conventionally have pore volumes of from 0.1 to 10 cm^/g, preferably from 0.2 to 5 cm"^/g, and specific surface areas of from 30 to 1000 m^/g, preferably from 50 to 800 m^/g, and in particular from 100 to 600 m^/g. In this context, the iron complex V is preferably applied in an amount such that the concentration of the iron from the iron complex V in the finished catalyst system is 1 to 100 lamol, preferably 5 to 80 iimol, and particularly preferably 10 to 60 jimol per g of finished catalyst system.<br>
The catalyst system can also additionally comprise as a further component one or more metal compounds of group 1, 2 or 13 of the periodic table, in particular metal compounds of the general formula (XX)<br>

Mixtures of various metal compounds	of the formula (XX)<br>
can also be employed.<br>

The partial<br><br>
hydrolysis products of aluminum-alkyls with alcohols .can also be employed.<br>
If a metal compound (XX) is employed, the catalyst system preferably comprises this in an amount such that the molar ratio of M'^ from formula (XX) to iron from the iron complex V is from 3000:1 to 0.1:1, preferably from 800:1 to 0.2:1, and particularly preferably from 100:1 to 1:1.<br>
As a rule, the metal compound of the general formula (XX) is employed as a constituent of a catalyst system for the polymerization or copolymerization of olefins. In this context, the metal compound (XX) can be used, for example, for the preparation of a catalyst solid comprising the support and/or added during or shortly before the polymerization. In this context, the metal compounds (XX) used can be identical or different. It is also possible, especially if the catalyst solid comprises no activating component, for the catalyst system to comprise one or more activators, in addition to the catalyst solid, which are identical to or different from compounds (XX) possibly contained in the catalyst solid.<br>
The metal compound (XX) can likewise be reacted with the iron complex V and optionally the activator and support in any desired sequence. For example, the iron complex V can be brought into contact with the activator or activators and/or the support either before or after being brought into contact with the olefins to be polymerized. Preactivation with one or more activators before thorough mixing with the olefin and further addition of the same or other activators and/or the support after this mixture has been brought into contact with the olefin is also possible. A preactivation is as a rule carried out at temperatures of between 10-100°C, preferably between 20-80°C.<br><br>
In another preferred embodiment, a catalyst solid is prepared from an iron complex V, an activator and a support, as described above, and this is brought into contact with the metal compound (XX) during, at the start of or shortly before the polymerization. Preferably, the metal compound (XX) is first brought into contact with the a-olefin to be polymerized and the catalyst solid of an iron complex V, an activator and a support is then added as described above.<br>
In a further preferred embodiment, the support is first brought into contact with the metal compound (XX) and thereafter the procedure with the iron complex V and possibly further activator is as  above.<br>
The catalyst system can optionally comprise further catalysts which are suitable for olefin polymerization. Possible catalysts here are, in particular, conventional Ziegler-Natta catalysts based on titanium, conventional Phillips catalysts based on chromium compounds, in particular chromium oxides, metallocenes, nickel and palladium bisimine systems (for the preparation thereof see WO-A-98/03559) and cobalt pyridinebisimine compounds (for the preparation thereof see WO-A-98/27124).<br>
So-called Ziegler catalyst components (as described e.g. in Falbe, J.; Regitz, M. (ed.); Rompp Chemie Lexi-kon [Rompp Chemical Dictionary]; 9th ed.; Thieme; 1992; New York; vol. 6, p. 5128 - 5129) and/or metallocene catalyst components are preferred. Metallocene catalyst components are particularly preferred.<br>
The Ziegler catalyst component is preferably a compound of a metal of group IVa (e.g. titanium, zirconium or hafnium), Va (e.g. vanadium or niobium) or Via (e.g. chromium or molybdenum) of the periodic table of the<br><br>
elements. Halides, oxides, oxyhalides, hydroxides or alkoxides are preferred. Examples of Ziegler catalyst components which are given by way of example but are not limiting are: titanium tetrachloride, zirconium tetrachloride, hafnium tetrachloride, titanium trichloride, vanadium trichloride, vanadium oxychloride, chromium trichloride or chromium oxide.<br>
In the present application, metallocene catalyst components are understood as meaning cyclopentadienyl complexes which comprise one, two or three cyclopentadienyl ligands. In the present application, cyclopentadienyl ligand is understood as meaning any system which comprises a cyclic 5-membered ring system having 6 n electrons, such as, for example, indenyl or fluorenyl systems. Metallocene complexes of metals of group III and the lanthanoid group (e.g. lanthanum or yttrium) as well as metals of group IV (e.g. titanium, zirconium or hafnium), V (e.g. vanadium or niobium) or VI of the periodic table of the elements (e.g. chromium or molybdenum) are preferred, and cyclopentadienyl complexes of titanium, zirconium or hafnium are particularly preferred. The cyclopentadienyl complexes can be e.g. bridged or non-bridged dicyclopentadienyl complexes, such as are described e.g. in EP 129 368, EP 561 479, EP 545 304 and EP 576 970, or monocyclopentadienyl complexes, such as bridged amidocyclopentadienyl complexes which are described e.g. in EP 416 815.<br>
The molar ratio of iron complex V to olefin polymerization catalyst is conventionally in the range of from 1:100 to 100:1, preferably from 1:10 to 10:1, and particularly preferably from 1:5 to 5:1.<br>
It is furthermore possible first to prepolymerize the catalyst system with a-olefins, preferably linear C2-CiG-1-alkenes,  and  in  particular  with  ethylene  or<br><br>
propylene, and then to use the resulting prepolymerized catalyst solid in the actual polymerization. The weight ratio of catalyst solid employed in the prepolymerization to monomer, to be polymerized in is conventionally in the range of from 1:0.1 to 1:1000, preferably 1:1 to 1:200.<br>
A small amount of an olefin, preferably an a-olefin, for example vinylcyclohexane, styrene or phenyldimethylvinylsilane, as a modifying component, an antistatic or a suitable inert compound, such as a wax or oil, can furthermore be added as an additive during or after the preparation of the catalyst system. In this context, the molar ratio of additives to iron complex V is conventionally in the range of from 1:1000 to 1000:1, preferably from 1:5 to 20:1.<br>
The catalyst composition according to the invention or the catalyst system is suitable for the preparation of the polyethylene according to the invention, which has advantageous use and processing properties.<br>
For the preparation of the polyethylene according to the invention, ethylene is polymerized with a-olefins having 3 to 12 C atoms as described above.<br>
In the process according to the invention for the polymerization, ethylene is polymerized with a-olefins having 3 to 12 C atoms. Preferred a-olefins are linear or branched C2-Ci2-l-alkenes, in particular linear C2-Cio-1-alkenes, such as ethene, propene, 1-butene, 1-pentene, 1-hexene, 1-heptene, 1-octene or 1-decene, or branched C2-Cio-l-alkenes, such as 4-methyl-l-pentene. C4-Ci2-1-Alkenes, in particular linear Ce-Cio-l-alkenes, are particularly preferred. Mixtures of various a-olefins can also be polymerized. Preferably, at least one a-olefin chosen from the group consisting of-ethene,  propene,  1-butene,  1-pentene,  1-hexene,  1-<br><br>
heptene, 1-octene and 1-decene is polymerized. Monomer mixtures with at least 50 mol% of ethene are preferably used.<br>
The process according to the invention for the polymerization of ethylene with a-olefins can be carried out with all the industrially known polymerization processes at temperatures in the range of from -60 to 350°C, preferably from 0 to 200°C, and particularly preferably from 25 to 150°C, and under pressures of from 0.5 to 4000 bar, preferably 1 to 100 bar, and particularly preferably from 3 to 40 bar. The polymerization can be carried out in a known manner in bulk, in suspension, in the gas phase or in a supercritical medium in the conventional reactors used for the polymerization of olefins. It can be carried out discontinuously or, preferably, continuously in one or more stages. High pressure polymerization processes in tube reactors or autoclaves, solution processes, suspension processes, stirred gas phase processes or gas phase fluidized bed processes are possible.<br>
The polymerizations are conventionally carried out at temperatures in the range of from -60 to 350°C, preferably in the range of from 20 to 300°C and under pressures of from 0.5 to 4000 bar. The mean dwell times are conventionally from 0.5 to 5 hours, preferably from 0.5 to 3 hours. The advantageous pressure and temperature ranges for carrying out the polymerizations conventionally depend on the polymerization method. In the high pressure polymerization processes, which are conventionally carried out at pressures of between 1000 and 4000 bar, in particular between 2000 and 3500 bar, as a rule high polymerization temperatures are also established. Advantageous temperature ranges for these high pressure polymerization processes are between 200 and 320°C, in particular between 220 and 290°C. In low pressure  polymerization  processes,   as  a  rule  a<br><br>
temperature which is at least a few degrees below the softening temperature of the polymer is established. In particular, temperatures of between 50 and 180°C, preferably between 70 and 120°C are established in these polymerization processes. In the suspension polymerizations, the polymerization is conventionally carried out in a suspending agent, preferably in an inert hydrocarbon, such as, for example, isobutane, or mixtures of hydrocarbons, or in the monomers themselves. The polymerization temperatures are in general in the range of from -20 to 115°C, and the pressure is in general in the range of from 1 to 100 bar. The solids content of the suspension is in general in the range of from 10 to 80%. The process can be carried out either discontinuously, e.g. in stirred autoclaves, or continuously, e.g. in tube reactors, preferably in loop reactors. In particular, the polymerization can be carried out by the Phillips-PF process, as described in US-A 3 242 150 and US-A 3 248 179. The gas phase polymerization is in general carried out in the range of from 30 to 125°C at pressures of from 1 to 50 bar.<br>
Of the polymerization processes mentioned, gas phase polymerization, in particular in gas phase fluidized bed reactors, solution polymerization, and suspension polymerization, in particular in loop and stirred tank reactors, are particularly preferred. The gas phase polymerization can also be carried out in the so-called condensed or supercondensed procedure, in which some of the circulating gas is cooled to below the dew point and is recycled into the reactor as a two-phase mixture, A so-called multizone reactor in which two polymerization zones are linked to one another and the polymer is passed in alternation several times through these two zones, it also being possible for the two zones to have different polymerization conditions, can furthermore be employed. Such a reactor is described,<br><br>
for example, in WO 97/04015. The different or also identical polymerization processes can also optionally be connected to one another in series and in this way form a polymerization cascade, such as, for example, in the Hostalen® process. A parallel reactor program of two or more identical or different processes is also possible. Molar mass regulators, for example hydrogen, or conventional additives, such as antistatics, can furthermore also be co-used in the polymerizations. Preferably, in order to obtain the high contents of vinyl groups, the polymerization is carried out in the absence of hydrogen.<br>
The polymerization is preferably carried out in an individual reactor, in particular in a gas phase reactor.<br>
The unsymmetric complexes according to the invention are very active in the polymerization of ethylene. Their activity is higher than that of the corresponding symmetric complexes. They are furthermore distinguished by narrow molar mass distributions.<br>
A further advantage is that the process is also very particularly suitable for the preparation of commercial amounts. Amounts of 2-200 kg of the bisimine compound can be prepared without problems. Furthermore, the bisimine product is formed in high purities, so that further working up steps are no longer necessary.<br>
