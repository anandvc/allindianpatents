In this formula R1 and R2 stand preferably, with particular preference or with very particular preference for those definitions which have already been mentioned as being preferred, particularly preferred, etc. for these radicals in connection with the description of the substances of the formula (I) according to the invention. Z1 is preferably bromine or iodine.<br><br><br>

A general definition of the organometallic compounds required as starting materials when carrying out process (D) of the invention is given by the formula (VI). In this formula Y and R3 stand preferably, with particular preference or with very particular preference for those definitions which have already been mentioned as being preferred, particularly preferred, etc. for these radicals in connection with the description of the substances of the formula (I) according to the invention. M is preferably ZnCl, Sn(Me)3 or Sn(n-Bu)3.<br>
Organometallic compounds of the formula (VI) are known in some cases or can be prepared by known methods. It is possible, for example, to prepare compounds of the formula (VI) in situ from the corresponding compounds of the formula (III) in which X is -OS02CF3, (cf. Tetrahedron Lett, mi, 36, 9085).<br>
When carrying out process (D) of the invention generally 1 mol or a slight excess of a compound of the formula (VI) is used per mole of compound of the formula (Il-a). It is also possible, however, to use the reaction components in different proportions. Working up takes place in accordance with customary methods. The general procedure is to take up the reaction mixture in ethyl acetate and to wash the organic phase with water, dry it over sodium sulphate, filter it and concentrate the filtrate. The residue is freed where appropriate from any impurities still present by customary methods, such as chromatography or recrystallization.<br>
Chiral compounds of the formula (I-a)<br>
Chiral compounds of the formula (I-a) can be prepared, for example, by subjecting A^pyrrolines of the formula (Il-b)<br><br><br>
(Il-b)<br>
in which<br>
R1 and R2 are as defined above and Z2       is chlorine, bromine or iodine,<br>
to racemate cleavage. This is done by working, for example, in accordance with methods of preparative chromatography, preferably by the method of high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). A chiral stationary silica gel phase is used. A silica gel modified with tris(3,5-dimethylphenylcarbamate)-cellulose has proven to be particularly suitable for resolving the compounds of the formula (Il-b) into the two enantiomers. This separation material is available commercially. It is also possible, however, to use other stationary phases. Suitable mobile phases include all customary inert, organic solvents, and also mixtures thereof. Preferred possibilities for use include optionally halogenated aliphatic, alicyclic or aromatic hydrocarbons, such as petroleum ether, hexane, heptane, cyclohexane; dichloromethane, chloroform; alcohols, such as methanol, ethanol, propanol; nitriles, such as acetonitrile; esters such as methyl acetate or ethyl acetate. Particular preference is given to using aliphatic hydrocarbons, such as hexane or heptane, and alcohols, such as methanol or propanol; very particular preference is given to n-heptane and isopropanol or mixtures thereof. Operation is generally carried out at temperatures between 10Â°C and 60Â°C, preferably between 10Â°C and 40Â°C, with particular preference at room temperature. The (R)-configured enantiomers obtained in this way are then used as starting materials for processes (A), (C) or (D).<br>
When carrying out processes (A), (B), (C) and (D) of the invention in each case a palladium catalyst is used which can be employed with or without the addition of further ligands. As the catalyst it is preferred to use PdCl2(dppf) [dppf = l,l'-bis(diphenylphosphino)ferrocene], Pd(PPh3)4, PdCl2(PPh3)2, PdCl2(CH3CN)2,<br><br><br><br>
Pd2(dba)3 [dba = dibenzylideneacetone] or Pd(OAc)2, with particular preference PdCl2(dppf), Pd(PPh3)4, PdCl2(PPh3)2, or Pd(OAc)2, with very particular preference PdCl2(dppf) or PdCl2(PPh3)2.<br>

If appropriate, the compounds according to the invention can, at certain concentrations or application rates, also be used as herbicides or microbicides, for example as fungicides, antimycotics and bactericides. If appropriate, they can also be employed as intermediates or precursors for the synthesis of other active compounds.<br>
All plants and plant parts can be treated in accordance with the invention. Plants are to be understood as meaning in the present context all plants and plant populations<br><br><br>
such as desired and undesired wild plants or crop plants (including naturally occurring crop plants). Crop plants can be plants which can be obtained by conventional plant breeding and optimization methods or by biotechnological and recombinant methods or by combinations of these methods, including the transgenic plants and including the plant cultivars protectable or not protectable by plant breeders' rights. Plant parts are to be understood as meaning all parts and organs of plants above and below the ground, such as shoot, leaf, flower and root, examples which may be mentioned being leaves, needles, stalks, stems, flowers, fruit bodies, fruits, seeds, roots, tubers and rhizomes. The plant parts also include harvested material, and vegetative and generative propagation material, for example cuttings, tubers, rhizomes, offsets and seeds.<br>
Treatment according to the invention of the plants and plant parts with the active compounds is carried out directly or by allowing the compounds to act on their surroundings, environment or storage space by the customary treatment methods, for example by immersion, spraying, evaporation, fogging, scattering, painting on and, in the case of propagation material, in particular in the case of seeds, also by applying one or more coats.<br>
The active compounds according to the invention can be converted into the customary formulations, such as solutions, emulsions, wettable powders, suspensions, powders, dusts, pastes, soluble powders, granules, suspension-emulsion concentrates, natural and synthetic materials impregnated with active compound and microencapsulations in polymeric substances.<br>
These formulations are produced in a known manner, for example by mixing the active compounds according to the invention with extenders, that is liquid solvents and/or solid carriers, optionally with the use of surfactants, that is emulsifiers and/or dispersants and/or foam-formers.<br>
If the extender used is water, it is also possible to employ for example organic solvents as auxiliary solvents. Essentially, suitable liquid solvents are: aromatics such as xylene,<br><br><br>
toluene or alkylnaphthalenes, chlorinated aromatics and chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbons such as chlorobenzenes, chloroethylenes or methylene chloride, aliphatic hydrocarbons such as cyclohexane or paraffins, for example petroleum fractions, mineral and vegetable oils, alcohols such as butanol or glycol and also their ethers and esters, ketones such as acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone or cyclohexanone, strongly polar solvents such as dimethylformamide and dimethyl sulphoxide, and also water.<br>
Suitable solid carriers are:<br>
for example ammonium salts and ground natural minerals such as kaolins, clays, talc, chalk, quartz, attapulgite, montmorillonite or diatomaceous earth, and ground synthetic minerals, such as highly disperse silica, alumina and silicates; suitable solid carriers for granules are: for example crushed and fractionated natural rocks such as calcite, marble, pumice, sepiolite and dolomite, and also synthetic granules of inorganic and organic meals, and granules of organic material such as sawdust, coconut shells, maize cobs and tobacco stalks; suitable emulsifiers and/or foam-formers are: for example nonionic and anionic emulsifiers, such as polyoxyethylene fatty acid esters, polyoxyethylene fatty alcohol ethers, for example alkylaryl polyglycol ethers, alkylsulphonates, alkyl sulphates, arylsulphonates and also protein hydrolysates; suitable dispersants are: for example lignosulphite waste liquors and methylcellulose.<br>
Tackifiers such as carboxymethylcellulose and natural and synthetic polymers in the form of powders, granules or latices, such as gum arabic, polyvinyl alcohol and polyvinyl acetate, as well as natural phospholipids such as cephalins and lecithins, and synthetic phospholipids, can be used in the formulations. Other additives can be mineral and vegetable oils.<br>
It is possible to use colorants such as inorganic pigments, for example iron oxide, titanium oxide and Prussian Blue, and organic dyestuffs, such as alizarin dyestuffs, azo dyestuffs and metal phthalocyanine dyestuffs, and trace nutrients such as salts of iron, manganese, boron, copper, cobalt, molybdenum and zinc.<br><br><br>
The formulations generally comprise between 0.1 and 95% by weight of active compound, preferably between 0.5 and 90%.<br>
The active compounds according to the invention can be used as such or in their formulations as a mixture with known fungicides, bactericides, acaracides, nematicides or insecticides, in order, for example, to increase the spectrum of activity or to prevent the development of resistance. In many cases synergistic effects are thus achieved, ie the efficacy of the mixture is greater than the efficacy of the individual components.<br>

It is also possible to admix other known active compounds, such as herbicides, fertilizers and growth regulators.<br>
When used as insecticides, the active compounds according to the invention can furthermore be present in their commercially available formulations and in the use forms, prepared from these formulations, as a mixture with synergistic agents. Synergistic agents are compounds which increase the action of the active compounds<br><br>
according to the invention, without it being necessary for the synergistic agent added to be active itself.<br>
The active compound content of the use forms prepared from the commercially available formulations can vary within wide limits. The active compound concentration of the use forms can be from 0.0000001 to 95% by weight of active compound, preferably between 0.0001 and 1% by weight.<br>
The compounds are employed in a customary manner appropriate for the use forms.<br>
When used against hygiene pests and pests of stored products, the active compound is distinguished by an excellent residual action on wood and clay as well as a good stability to alkali on limed substrates.<br>
As already mentioned above, it is possible to treat all plants and their parts according to the invention. In a preferred embodiment, wild plant species and plant cultivars, or those obtained by conventional biological breeding, such as crossing or protoplast fusion, and parts thereof, are treated. In a further preferred embodiment, transgenic plants and plant cultivars obtained by genetic engineering, if appropriate in combination with conventional methods (Genetically Modified Organisms), and parts thereof are treated. The term "parts" or "parts of plants" or "plant parts" has been explained above.<br>
Particularly preferably, plants of the plant cultivars which are in each case commercially available or in use are treated according to the invention. By plant cultivars are meant plants having new properties ("traits"), bred either by conventional breeding, by mutagenesis or by recombinant DNA techniques. They may be cultivars, biotypes and genotypes.<br>
Depending on the plant species or plant cultivars, their location and growth conditions (soils, climate, vegetation period, diet), the treatment according to the invention may also result in superadditive ("synergistic") effects. Thus, for example,<br><br><br>
reduced application rates and/or a widening of the activity spectrum and/or an increase in the activity of the substances and compositions to be used according to the invention, better plant growth, increased tolerance to high or low temperatures, increased tolerance to drought or to water or soil salt content, increased flowering performance, easier harvesting, accelerated maturation, higher harvest yields, better quality and/or a higher nutritional value of the harvested products, better storage stability and/or processability of the harvested products are possible which exceed the effects which were actually to be expected.<br>
The preferred transgenic plants or plant cultivars (i.e. those obtained by genetic engineering) which are to be treated according to the invention include all plants which, in the genetic modification, received genetic material which imparted particularly advantageous useful properties ("traits") to these plants. Examples of such properties are better plant growth, increased tolerance to high or low temperatures, increased tolerance to drought or to water or soil salt content, increased flowering performance, easier harvesting, accelerated maturation, higher harvest yields, better quality and/or a higher nutritional value of the harvested products, better storage stability and/or processability of the harvested products. Further and particularly emphasized examples of such properties are a better defence of the plants against animal and microbial pests, such as against insects, mites, phytopathogenic fungi, bacteria and/or viruses, and also increased tolerance of the plants to certain herbicidally active compounds. Examples of transgenic plants which may be mentioned are the important crop plants, such as cereals (wheat, rice), maize, soya beans, potatoes, cotton, oilseed rape and also fruit plants (with the fruits apples, pears, citrus fruits and grapevines), and particular emphasis is given to maize, soya beans, potatoes, cotton and oilseed rape. Traits that are emphasized are in particular increased defence of the plants against insects by toxins formed in the plants, in particular those formed by the genetic material from Bacillus thuringiensis (for example by the genes CrylA(a), CrylA(b), CrylA(c), CryllA, CrylilA, CryIIIB2, Cry9c, Cry2Ab, Cry3Bb and CrylF and also combinations thereof) (hereinbelow referred to as "Bt plants"). Traits that are also particularly emphasized are increased defence of plants against fungi, bacteria and viruses by systematic acquired resistance<br><br><br><br>
(SAR), systemine, phytoalexins, elicitors and resistance genes and corresponding expressed proteins and toxins. Traits that are furthermore particularly emphasized are the increased tolerance of the plants to certain herbicidally active compounds, for example imidazolinones, sulphonylureas, glyphosate or phosphinotricin (for example the "PAT" gene). The genes which impart the desired traits in question can also be present in combination with one another in the transgenic plants. Examples of "Bt plants" which may be mentioned are maize varieties, cotton varieties, soya bean varieties and potato varieties which are sold under the trade names YIELD GARDÂ® (for example maize, cotton, soya beans), KnockOutÂ® (for example maize), StarLinkÂ® (for example maize), BollgardÂ® (cotton), NucotnÂ® (cotton) and NewLeafÂ® (potato). Examples of herbicide-tolerant plants which may be mentioned are maize varieties, cotton varieties and soya bean varieties which are sold under the trade names Roundup ReadyÂ® (tolerance to glyphosate, for example maize, cotton, soya bean), Liberty LinkÂ® (tolerance to phosphinotricin, for example oilseed rape), IMIÂ® (tolerance to imidazolinones) and STSÂ® (tolerance to sulphonylureas, for example maize). Herbicide-resistant plants (plants bred in a conventional manner for herbicide tolerance) which may be mentioned include the varieties sold under the name ClearfieldÂ® (for example maize). Of course, these statements also apply to plant cultivars having these or still to be developed genetic traits, which plants will be developed and/or marketed in the future.<br>
The plants listed can be treated according to the invention in a particularly advantageous manner with the compounds of the general formula (I) or the active compound mixtures according to the invention. The preferred ranges stated above for the active compounds or mixtures also apply to the treatment of these plants. Particular emphasis is given to the treatment of plants with the compounds or the mixtures specifically mentioned in the present text.<br>

The active compounds of the formula (I) according to the invention are also suitable for controlling arthropods which infest agricultural productive livestock, such as, for example, cattle, sheep, goats, horses, pigs, donkeys, camels, buffalo, rabbits, chickens, turkeys, ducks, geese and bees, other pets, such as, for example, dogs, cats, caged birds and aquarium fish, and also so-called test animals, such as, for example, hamsters, guinea pigs, rats and mice. By controlling these arthropods, cases of death and reduction in productivity (for meat, milk, wool, hides, eggs, honey etc.) should be diminished, so that more economic and easier animal husbandry is possible by use of the active compounds according to the invention.<br>
The active compounds according to the invention are used in the veterinary sector in a known manner by enteral administration in the form of, for example, tablets, capsules, potions, drenches, granules, pastes, boluses, the feed-through process and suppositories, by parenteral administration, such as, for example, by injection (intramuscular, subcutaneous, intravenous, intraperitoneal and the like), implants, by nasal administration, by dermal use in the form, for example, of dipping or bathing, spraying, pouring on and spotting on, washing and powdering, and also with the aid of moulded articles containing the active compound, such as collars, ear marks, tail marks, limb bands, halters, marking devices and the like.<br>
When used for cattle, poultry, pets and the like, the active compounds of the formula (I) according to the invention can be used as formulations (for example powders, emulsions, free-flowing compositions), which comprise the active compounds according to the invention in an amount of 1 to 80% by weight, directly or after 100 to 10 000-fold dilution, or they can be used as a chemical bath.<br>
It has furthermore been found that the compounds according to the invention have a strong insecticidal action against insects which destroy industrial materials.<br><br>

Industrial materials in the present connection are to be understood as meaning nonÂ¬living materials, such as, preferably, plastics, adhesives, sizes, papers and cards, leather, wood and processed wood products and coating compositions.<br>
Wood and processed wood products are materials to be protected, especially preferably, from insect infestation.<br>
Wood and processed wood products which can be protected by the agents according to the invention or mixtures comprising these are to be understood as meaning, for example:<br><br><br>
building timber, wooden beams, railway sleepers, bridge components, boat jetties, wooden vehicles, boxes, pallets, containers, telegraph poles, wood panelling, wooden window frames and doors, plywood, chipboard, joinery or wooden products which are used quite generally in house-building or in building joinery.<br>
The active compounds according to the invention can be used as such, in the form of concentrates or in generally customary formulations, such as powders, granules, solutions, suspensions, emulsions or pastes.<br>
The formulations mentioned can be prepared in a manner known per se, for example by mixing the active compounds according to the invention with at least one solvent or diluent, emulsifier, dispersing agent and/or binder or fixing agent, a water repellent, if appropriate siccatives and UV stabilizers and if appropriate dyestuffs and pigments, and also other processing auxiliaries.<br>
The insecticidal compositions or concentrates used for the preservation of wood and wood-derived timber products comprise the active compound according to the invention in a concentration of 0.0001 to 95% by weight, in particular 0.001 to 60% by weight.<br>
The amount of the compositions or concentrates employed depends on the nature and occurrence of the insects and on the medium. The optimum amount employed can be determined for the use in each case by series of tests. In general, however, it is sufficient to employ 0.0001 to 20% by weight, preferably 0.001 to 10% by weight, of the active compound, based on the material to be preserved.<br>
Solvents and/or diluents which are used are an organic chemical solvent or solvent mixture and/or an oily or oil-like organic chemical solvent or solvent mixture of low volatility and/or a polar organic chemical solvent or solvent mixture and/or water, and if appropriate an emulsifier and/or wetting agent.<br><br><br><br>
Organic chemical solvents which are preferably used are oily or oil-like solvents having an evaporation number above 35 and a flashpoint above 30Â°C, preferably above 45Â°C. Substances which are used as such oily or oil-like water-insoluble solvents of low volatility are appropriate mineral oils or aromatic fractions thereof, or solvent mixtures containing mineral oils, preferably white spirit, petroleum and/or alkylbenzene.<br>
Mineral oils having a boiling range from 170 to 220Â°C, white spirit having a boiling range from 170 to 220Â°C, spindle oil having a boiling range from 250 to 350Â°C, petroleum and aromatics having a boiling range from 160 to 280Â°C, terpentine oil and the like, are advantageously employed.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, liquid aliphatic hydrocarbons having a boiling range from 180 to 210Â°C or high-boiling mixtures of aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbons having a boiling range from 180 to 220Â°C and/or spindle oil and/or monochloronaphthalene, preferably a-monochloronaphthalene, are used.<br>
The organic oily or oil-like solvents of low volatility which have an evaporation number above 35 and a flashpoint above 30Â°C, preferably above 45Â°C, can be replaced in part by organic chemical solvents of high or medium volatility, provided that the solvent mixture likewise has an evaporation number above 35 and a flashpoint above 30Â°C, preferably above 45Â°C, and that the insecticide/fungicide mixture is soluble or emulsifiable in this solvent mixture.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment, some of the organic chemical solvent or solvent mixture is replaced by an aliphatic polar organic chemical solvent or solvent mixture. Aliphatic organic chemical solvents containing hydroxyl and/or ester and/or ether groups, such as, for example, glycol ethers, esters or the like, are preferably used.<br>
Organic chemical binders which are used in the context of the present invention are the synthetic resins and/or binding drying oils which are known per se, are water-<br><br><br>
dilutable and/or are soluble or dispersible or emulsifiable in the organic chemical solvents employed, in particular binders consisting of or comprising an acrylate resin, a vinyl resin, for example polyvinyl acetate, polyester resin, polycondensation or polyaddition resin, polyurethane resin, alkyd resin or modified alkyd resin, phenolic resin, hydrocarbon resin, such as indene-coumarone resin, silicone resin, drying vegetable oils and/or drying oils and/or physically drying binders based on a natural and/or synthetic resin.<br>
The synthetic resin used as the binder can be employed in the form of an emulsion, dispersion or solution. Bitumen or bituminous substances can also be used as binders in an amount of up to 10% by weight. Dyestuffs, pigments, water-repelling agents, odour correctants and inhibitors or anticorrosive agents and the like which are known per se can additionally be employed.<br>
It is preferred according to the invention for the composition or concentrate to comprise, as the organic chemical binder, at least one alkyd resin or modified alkyd resin and/or a drying vegetable oil. Alkyd resins having an oil content of more than 45% by weight, preferably 50 to 68% by weight, are preferably used according to the invention.<br>
All or some of the binder mentioned can be replaced by a fixing agent (mixture) or a plasticizer (mixture). These additives are intended to prevent evaporation of the active compounds and crystallization or precipitation. They preferably replace 0.01 to 30% of the binder (based on 100% of the binder employed).<br>
The plasticizers originate from the chemical classes of phthalic acid esters, such as dibutyl, dioctyl or benzyl butyl phthalate, phosphoric acid esters, such as tributyl phosphate, adipic acid esters, such as di-(2-ethylhexyl) adipate, stearates, such as butyl stearate or amyl stearate, oleates, such as butyl oleate, glycerol ethers or higher molecular weight glycol ethers, glycerol esters and p-toluenesulphonic acid esters.<br><br>
LP-A 3 5-653=FoTeign Countries<br>
Fixing agents are based chemically on polyvinyl alkyl ethers, such as, for example, polyvinyl methyl ether or ketones, such as benzophenone or ethylenebenzophenone.<br>
Possible solvents or diluents are, in particular, also water, if appropriate as a mixture with one or more of the abovementioned organic chemical solvents or diluents, emulsifiers and dispersing agents.<br>
Particularly effective preservation of wood is achieved by impregnation processes on a large industrial scale, for example vacuum, double vacuum or pressure processes.<br>
The ready-to-use compositions can also comprise other insecticides, if appropriate, and also one or more fungicides, if appropriate.<br>
Possible additional mixing partners are, preferably, the insecticides and fungicides mentioned in WO 94/29 268. The compounds mentioned in this document are an explicit constituent of the present application.<br>
Especially preferred mixing partners which may be mentioned are insecticides, such as chlorpyriphos, phoxim, silafluofin, alphamethrin, cyfluthrin, cypermethrin, deltamethrin, permethrin, imidacloprid, NI-25, flufenoxuron, hexafiumuron, transfluthrin, thiacloprid, methoxyfenozide and triflumuron,<br>

The compounds according to the invention can at the same time be employed for protecting objects which come into contact with saltwater or brackish water, such as hulls, screens, nets, buildings, moorings and signalling systems, against fouling.<br><br><br>
Fouling by sessile Oligochaeta, such as Serpulidae, and by shells and species from the Ledamorpha group (goose barnacles), such as various Lepas and Scalpellum species, or by species from the Balanomorpha group (acorn barnacles), such as Balanus or Pollicipes species, increases the frictional drag of ships and, as a consequence, leads to a marked increase in operation costs owing to higher energy consumption and additionally frequent residence in the dry dock.<br>
Apart from fouling by algae, for example Ectocarpus sp. and Ceramium sp., fouling by sessile Entomostraka groups, which come under the generic term Cirripedia (cirriped crustaceans), is of particular importance.<br>
Surprisingly, it has now been found that the compounds according to the invention, alone or in combination with other active compounds, have an outstanding antifouling action.<br>

Preparation examples Example 1<br><br>
5-(2,6-Difluorophenyl)-2-[4-(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-l,3,2-dioxaborolan-2-yl)phenyl]-3,4-dihydro-2H-pyrrole (0.96 g, 2.50 mmol) is introduced in 1,2-dimethoxyethane (70 ml) under an argon atmosphere. Added in succession are 5-bromo-2-ethoxypyridine (DI-1) (0.61 g, 3.00 mmol), l,r-bis(diphenylphosphino)ferrocenepal-ladium(II) chloride (0.05 g, 0.07 mol) and 3.75 ml of sodium carbonate solution (20% strength, w/v). The reaction mixture is allowed to continue reaction at 80Â°C for 16 h.<br>
Thereafter, water/ethyl acetate are added to the reaction mixture and the organic phase is separated off, dried over sodium sulphate, filtered, mixed with 5 g of Florisil and concentrated. The crude product is purified by chromatography on silica gel (mobile phase: n-hexane/ethyl acetate 4:1).<br>
This gives 0.68 g (67% of theory) of 5-{4-[5-(2,6-difluorophenyl)-3,4-dihydro-2H-<br>
pyrrol-2-yl]phenyl} -2-ethoxypyridine.<br>
HPLC:	logP (pH 2.3) = 2.92<br>

Preparation of starting materials of the formula (HI)<br>
Example <br><br>
0.49 g (20.26 mmol) of sodium hydride is introduced under argon and cooled to 10Â°C. 10 ml of dimethylformamide are added. Subsequently a solution of 0.93 g (20.26 mmol) of ethanol in 40 ml of dimethylformamide is added slowly dropwise and reaction is allowed to continue for 30 minutes. Thereafter 4.00 g (16.89 mmol) of 2,5-dibromopyridine are added dropwise and reaction is allowed to continue for a further 16 hours.<br>
Water is added to the reaction mixture. It is extracted three times with ethyl acetate. The organic phase is washed once with sodium hydrogen carbonate solution and once with sodium chloride solution, dried over sodium sulphate, filtered and concentrated.<br>
This gives 2.35 g (67% of theory) of 5-bromo-2-ethoxypyridine.<br>
HPLC:	logP (pH 2.3) = 2.92<br>
NMR (CD3CN):    5 = 1.33 (t, 3H), 4.27-4.32 (m, 2H), 6.68 (d, 1H), 7.75 (m, 1H), 8.2 (d, 1H) ppm.<br>
U<br><br>
The log p values reported in the above tables and preparation examples are determined in accordance with EEC Directive 79/831 Annex V.A8 by means of HPLC (high performance liquid chromatography) on a reversed-phase column (C 18). Temperature: 43Â°C.<br>
Determination is carried out in the acidic range at a pH of 2.3 using 0.1% aqueous phosphoric acid and acetonitrile as mobile phases; linear gradient from 10% acetonitrile to 90% acetonitrile. The values are marked in the tables with a).<br>
Determination takes place in the neutral range at a pH of 7.5 with 0.01-molar aqueous phosphate buffer solution and acetonitrile as mobile phases; linear gradient from 10% acetonitrile to 90% acetonitrile. The values are marked in the tables with b&gt;.<br>
The calibration is carried out using unbranched alkan-2-ones (having from 3 to 16 carbon atoms) whose logP values are known (logP values determined on the basis of the retention times, using linear interpolation between two successive alkanones).<br>
The lambda max values were determined in the maxima of the chromatographic signals using the UV spectra from 200 nm to 400 nm.<br><br>
