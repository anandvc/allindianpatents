				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention in general relates to the Mobile Phone Application, GPS, Object detection system like RFID, Bluetooth etc. Particularly the present invention relates to a method for tracking an object using object detection system and GPS integrated mobile device.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE RELATED ART<br>
Existing object tracking systems use the following methodology:<br>
•	Objects (that need to be tracked) transmit GPS information to a centralized server.<br>
•	This info is processed by the server and is used to detect location of the object. The data can be transmitted over the existing cellular data networks.<br>
•	RFID tags can be used to provide unique identification to objects.<br>
However the system has a limitation that the objects to be located need to have ability to obtain and send GPS data.<br>
The US Patent number 6901304 describes an item tracking system architectures providing real-time visibility to supply chain. It explains a method and apparatus, including computer program products, for providing multiple enterprises real-time access to information about items in a supply chain. Tags bound to items are read and information read from the tags and location information about the tags is provided by at least two enterprises and used to maintain disposition information about the items, which is made visible to enterprises in the supply chain. The tags can be radio-frequency identification tags having each having an ePC (electronic product code) as unique tag identifier. Visibility of the disposition information can be controlled through authorization. Visible information can include relationships between particular items and business documents such as order and shipping documents. With shipping documents visible, information read from item tags can<br><br>
be used to confirm the identity or completeness of a shipment. However the system is applicable only to supply chains.<br>
US Patent (No. 6859171), disclosed a method and apparatus for an object locator system for requesting and obtaining information about the location of a mobile object, having attached thereon a lightweight object locator, operable in a region served by a two-way paging system and a global positioning satellite system. The object locator may be selectively activated to conserve power or enabled to respond only when beyond or within a boundary. Further, the object locator system may provide the location information in several forms including rectangular or polar coordinates referred to a base station or origin, position on a map display, etc. In alternate embodiments the two-way paging system may be substituted by a direct wireless link or a satellite relay communications link; the location information may be translated into human readable form either before or after transmission from the object locator; the location information may be presented at an output as selectable text; spoken message or graphic display including a map. However the body or object to be located needs to have ability to obtain and send GPS data.<br>
Yet another US Patent (No. 6977612) describes a system and method employing a combination of long-range and short-range asset location systems, preferably a GPS-based system combined with an RFID-based system. The short-range system regularly activates itself, or is remotely polled, to determine if the asset is within range of the short-range transceivers, and the long-range system is activated to determine the location of the asset when it is outside the range of the short-range transceivers. In at least some embodiments, the asset is an automobile equipped with both RFID and GPS-based transceivers. Here also the object to be located should have the ability to obtain and send GPS data.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides a method to track an object using an object detection system, like RFID and GPS integrated mobile device or any other similar<br><br>
location detection systems. The present invention uses the existing object detection system like SFID which can be extended to other object detection mechanism like Bluetooth. This method provides an approximate location of an object. The objects are provided with RFID tags that uniquely identify them (It can be an active or passive RFID device). The Mobile device has an RFID transmitter (Interrogator) that periodically or as per users wish keeps detecting the objects through their RFID tags. Every time an object is detected, the mobile's current location is registered as the current location of the object. This is a good approximation as the range of RFID (we shall be using low end, Low frequency RFID systems 30 KHz - 500 KHz) is less, generally less than few feet.<br>
At a later time when we need to locate the position of an object, the mobile's current GPS location and the object's last stored location can be input to the GPS application. It is important to note that when user wants to locate the object at that time object might not be in the RFID range in this case last stored GPS location is used to draw map from current location of mobile. The GPS application can generate a route map to reach to the object.<br>
The user can maintain a list of objects that he wishes to monitor and provide them with RFID tags. The mobile device using the mechanism described above can provide the location of the desired object whenever required by the user. The user interface in Mobile handset provides mechanism to register and select any object to find its last detected location.<br>
The system is more user convenient since it eliminates the tedious manual search.<br>
Accordingly this invention explains a method for tracking an object using object detection system and GPS integrated mobile device comprising the steps of:<br>
providing the objects with RFID tags that uniquely identify the said objects ;<br>
periodically detecting the objects through their RFID tags by a RFID transmitter/interrogator in the mobile device; and<br><br>
registering the mobile's current location and assigning the said location as the current location of the object in the memory when an object is detected,<br>
wherein at a later time to locate the position of an object, the mobile's current GPS location and the object's last stored location are given to the GPS application and the GPS application generates a route map showing the location of the object.<br>
If locating the object at that time when object is not in the RFID range last stored GPS location is used to draw map from current location of mobile. The user interface in Mobile handset provides mechanism to register and select any object to find its last detected location. The object detection system used is RFDI. For registration of an object by RFID interrogation ,user Interface in the Mobile handset provides mechanism to list the desired RFID tag attached to an object. For registration user press add menu and the scanner starts searching for nearby RFID tag and when RFID tag is detected User interface provides an option to give appropriate name to this ID, and an option to save the ID along with user defined name. The RFID is stored alongside a user-defined name to identify the entry for the object and the Mobile uses GPS to get the mobile's current location and updates the GPS location of the object with the value where the object's location is considered same as the mobile's current location. If RFID reader which is integrated with mobile device finds any tagged object, the said Mobile device updates the GPS co-ordinates for that object using GPS receiver. While periodic interrogation of Listed objects in the object list if RFID interrogator detects an ID which is already listed in its object list the interrogator updates the location co-ordinates and stores this information into its data base where the location co-ordinates are obtained by using GPS receiver or using a location detection mechanism. The period of interrogation is fixed or user defined and if the period is user defined then User Interface provides a mechanism to set the interrogation period to a desired value. The user interface provide mechanism to select desired object which is already listed in the object list comprising the steps of:<br><br>
retrieving the last stored location co-ordinates of the object from the data base when user select any object and press a key to find the last detected location of the object from mobile hand set;<br>
finding out the objects current location co-ordinates by the mobile handset; and<br>
displaying a route map or indicator to the last detected location of the object by utilizing current and last stored location co-ordinates in the user Interface of the mobile handset.<br>
These and other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become more readily apparent from the detailed description taken in conjunction with the drawings and the claims. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The preferred embodiments of the present invention will now be explained with reference to the accompanying drawings. The following description and drawings are illustrative of the invention and are not to be construed as limiting the innovation. Numerous specific details are described to provide a through understanding of the present invention. However in certain instances well-known or conventional details are not described in order not to unnecessarily obscure the present invention in detail.<br><br>
The following are the elements in the present invention:<br>
1.	Mobile Phone<br>
a.	RFID reader (Interrogator)<br>
b.	GPS receiver with Integrated Application to draw map<br>
2.	Objects with RFID tags (Active or Passive)<br>
The Proposed mechanism uses RFID tags for identifying different objects. The Objects to be tracked need to be registered with the mobile. RFID reader and GPS receivers are integrated with Mobile device of the user. The Ul in mobile device provide facility to add or delete list of objects to be tracked based on RFID. The Registration process can be triggered by the press of a key (soft key / hot key) in the mobile phone. This will trigger the mobile to query the RFID of the desired object.<br>
Figure 1 shows Registration of an object by RFID interrogation. RFID Interogator (or scanner) is integrated with Mobile handset. User Interface in the Mobile handset provides mechanism to list the desired RFID tag (attached to an object). When user press add menu scanner starts search of nearby RFID tag. When RFID tag is detected User interface provide mechanism to give appropriate name to this ID, and option to save the ID along with user defined name. User can repeat this operation for all those objects which he/she wants to find using this mechanism.<br>
This RFID is stored alongside a user-defined name to identify the entry for the object. The Mobile uses GPS to get its (Mobile's) current location and updates the GPS location of the object with the value. Here the object's location is approximated to be same as the mobile's current location.<br>
Mobile device periodically interrogates different RFID tags which are fixed to different objects. If RFID reader which is integrated with mobile device finds any tagged object Mobile device updates the GPS co-ordinates for that object using GPS receiver (The location of the object is assumed to be approximately the same as location of the Mobile)<br><br>
Figure 2 shows Periodic Interrogation of Listed objects in the object list which are already registered using mechanism shown in Figure 1. Here mobile handset periodically interrogates RFID tags available in the range. Whenever it detects an ID which is already listed in its object list it updates the location co-ordinates and stores this information into its data base. Location co-ordinates can be obtained by using GPS receiver which is integrated with Mobile handset, or some other location detection mechanism. The period of this interrogation can be fixed or can be user defined. If it is user defined mechanism then User Interface provides a mechanism to set the interrogation period to a desired value. Interrogation of listed RFID tags and updating of location co-ordinates (where this RFID tag was last detected) is an automatic process and no user intervention is required.<br>
When user wants to find any object mobile device displays the path to the tagged object based on user's current GPS co-ordinates and last updated GPS location of the object.<br>
Figure 3 shows how to get the location of the desired object. User interface provide mechanism to select desired object (which is already listed in the object list) When user select any object and press a key to find the last detected location of the object, mobile handset retrieves the last stored location co-ordinates of the object from it data base. Mobile handset also finds out its current location co-ordinates. User Interface of the mobile handset can display a route map or indicator to the last detected location of the object by utilizing current and last stored location co-ordinates.<br>
It will also be obvious to those skilled in the art that other control methods and apparatuses can be derived from the combinations of the various methods and apparatuses of the present invention as taught by the description and the accompanying drawings and these shall also be considered within the scope of the present invention. Further, description of such combinations and variations is therefore omitted above. It should also be noted that the host for storing the<br><br>
applications include but not limited to a microchip, microprocessor, handheld communication device, computer, rendering device or a multi function device.<br>
Although the present invention has been fully described in connection with the preferred embodiments thereof with reference to the accompanying drawings, it is to be noted that various changes and modifications are possible and are apparent to those skilled in the art. Such changes and modifications are to be understood as included within the scope of the present invention as defined by the appended claims unless they depart therefrom.<br><br>
