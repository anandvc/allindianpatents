				<td>TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001J The invention relates to an attachable/detachable process cartridge, an attachable/detachable<br>
drum cartridge, an attachable/detachable developer cartridge, and an image forming device capable of<br>
employing an attachable/detachable process cartridge, an attachable/detachable drum cartridge, and/or an<br>
attachable/detachable developer cartridge.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
[0002] Electrostatographic image forming devices may include an optical system, a photosensitive<br>
device (e.g., a photosensitive drum), a charging device arranged in the vicinity of the photosensitive device, a<br>
developer device (e.g., developer roller), a transfer device (e.g., transfer roller), and a cleaning means. In<br>
general, electrostatographic image forming devices record images by forming an electrostatic latent image on a<br>
photosensitive device, forming a developer image by supplying developer to the formed electrostatic latent<br>
image on the photosensitive device, and transferring the developer image onto a recording medium. More<br>
particularly, for example, to form an image on a recording medium, the surface of the photosensitive drum is<br>
uniformly charged by the charging device before the surface is irradiated with a laser beam so as to form an<br>
electrostatic latent image corresponding to the image to be formed on the photosensitive drum. The latent<br>
image is then developed using a developer supplied by the developer roller such that a developer image is<br>
formed on the photosensitive drum. The developer image is then transferred to the recording medium by the<br>
transfer roller. After the visible image is transferred most, and preferably all, of any toner remaining on the<br>
photosensitive body is removed by the cleaning means.<br>
[0003] In many of these image formation devices, many of the image forming components, such as,<br>
the photosensitive device, the charging device, the developer roller, the transfer roller and/or the cleaning means<br>
are provided, for example, in a process cartridge that is attachable to/detachable from the image forming device.<br>
Examples of such a process cartridge are disclosed in, for example, U.S. Patent Nos. 6,041,203 and 6,546,217.<br>
Such process cartridges may be employed to facilitate, for example, replacement and/or maintenance operations<br>
of one or more of the components included in the process cartridge.<br>
[0004] Process cartridges generally include a casing, in which the components of the process<br>
cartridge are housed, and on which a plurality of electrodes and driving gears are arranged. One of these<br>
electrodes may serve as a ground connection and another of these electrodes may feed electric power, from a<br>
power source arranged in the main body of the image forming device, to various components of the process<br>
cartridge. The driving gears interact with gears and/or members of the image forming device in order to drive<br>
various components of the process cartridge.<br>
[0005] Image forming devices which employ such attachable/detachable process cartridges generally<br>
have an internal space or pathway allocated for attaching and detaching the process cartridge to and from the<br>
image forming device. Generally, when such process cartridges are attached to the image forming device, the<br>
process cartridge is arranged within a cavity of the image forming device such that various components of the<br>
process cartridge can effectively communicate with other components of the image forming device. When such<br>
attachable/detachable process cartridges are being arranged in or removed from the image forming device,<br>
exposed portions of the process cartridge may rub against exposed portions of the image forming device located<br>
along and around the internal space or pathway allocated for installing and removing the process cartridge.<br>
While such image forming devices generally include some form of a guiding mechanism (e.g., a groove) for<br>
guiding the process cartridge in and out of the image forming device, contact between exposed portions of the<br>
process cartridge and the image forming device may occur at least until the process cartridge is engaged with<br>
the guiding mechanism. Further, even when guide grooves are provided, some guide grooves are not restrictive<br>
enough to prevent such undesirable contact. Thus, generally, at least portions of the process cartridge that are<br>
first to enter the image forming device during attachment of the process cartridge (i.e., portions of the process<br>
cartridge which are removed last during detachment of the process cartridge), are generally prone to rubbing or<br>
undesirable, and possibly damaging, contact with the image forming device.<br>
[0006] While some portions of the process cartridge are formed so as to be a protective body for<br>
components of the process cartridge, some portions and/or components of the process cartridge are intentionally<br>
exposed so that they can contact and work with components of the image forming device when the process<br>
cartridge is arranged in the image forming device. Such exposed portions that are to interact with other<br>
components may be damaged by the rubbing that generally occurs between the exposed portions and the image<br>
forming device during installation and removal of the process cartridge to/from the image forming device. In<br>
particular, if, for example, an electrode arranged on an outer surface of the process cartridge is damaged by such<br>
rubbing, the process cartridge and/or the image forming device may work improperly.<br>
[0007] In some cases, a shutter-like cover that opens to expose, for example, the electrode when the<br>
process cartridge is set in an arranged position within the image forming device may be provided in order to<br>
reduce, and preferably prevent damage to the exposed portion. It may not be desirable, however, to provide<br>
such a shutter-like mechanism at least because of the likely increase in cost and/or size of the process cartridge<br>
and/or image forming device.<br>
[0008] In particular, there is an increased demand for smaller and smaller image forming devices. To<br>
meet this increasing demand, smaller process cartridges must also be provided. At first glance, reducing the<br>
size of a process cartridge and/or image forming device may appear to be a straight forward task (e.g., reduce a<br>
size of all the components by X%). However, many factors and/or needs aggravate this deceivingly simple task<br>
and, those skilled in the art understand that, in fact, various design considerations and requirements make the<br>
process quite complex. Further, it is to be appreciated that, in recent years, the overall size of image forming<br>
devices and process cartridges has already been reduced substantially and for practicality purposes, there are<br>
some "minimum size" restraints on certain components of an image forming device and/or process cartridge.<br>
Thus, the playing field (i.e., amount of free/excess space available) has already been reduced substantially.<br>
Accordingly, those skilled in the art understand that the task of designing and implementing even smaller image<br>
forming devices and even smaller process cartridges while still providing practical devices and cartridges<br>
requires extensive experiment, thought and creativity.<br>

BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
[0068] Throughout the following description, numerous specific structures are set forth in order to<br>
provide a thorough understanding of one or more aspects of the invention. The various aspects of the invention<br>
can be practiced without utilizing all of these specific structures. In other instances, well known elements have<br>
not been shown or described in detail, so that emphasis can be focused on the various aspects of the invention.<br>
[0069] To form an image, some image forming devices such as laser printers and copiers, charge a<br>
surface of the photosensitive device (e.g., the photosensitive drum) with a charging device (e.g., a corona<br>
charger) before irradiating the photosensitive drum with a laser beam to form an electrostatic latent image,<br>
corresponding to the image to be formed, on the photosensitive drum. The formed latent image is then<br>
developed using a developing agent (e.g., toner) supplied by a developer carrying device (e.g., developer roller).<br>
The formed developer image is then transferred to a recording medium (e.g., paper) by a transfer device (e.g.,<br>
transfer roller). The transferred developer image is then subjected to heat and/or pressure by a fixing device.<br>
[0070J For ease of discussion, in the following description of the exemplary embodiments of one or<br>
more aspects of the invention, the side of the laser printer 1 on which a front cover 7 is arranged will be referred<br>
to as the "front" or "front side" and the side substantially opposite the side on which the front cover 7 is<br>
arranged will be referred to as the "back" or "back side". With regard to various individual objects of the laser<br>
primer 1 and/or process cartridge 20, sides of the individual objects will be similarly identified based on the<br>
arranged/attached position of the object on/in the laser printer 1. With regard to various attachable/detachable<br>
components of the laser printer 1, a direction along which the attachable/detachable object is to be moved to be<br>
detachably attached to the laser printer 1 will be identified as an installing direction. Further, a side will be<br>
considered to be the "left side" if, while the object is arranged in the laser printer 1, the side is on the left side<br>
when viewing the object from the front of the laser printer 1, and a side will be considered to be the "right side"<br>
if, while the object is arranged in the laser printer 1, the side is on the right side when viewing the object from<br>
the front of the laser printer 1.<br>
[0071] Further, a side or portion will be considered to be the "top" or "upper" side if, while the object<br>
is arranged in the laser printer 1, the side or portion is on the top side or top portion when viewing the object<br>
from the front of the laser printer 1, as situated in FIG. 1. A side or portion will be considered to be the<br>
"bottom" or "lower" side if, while the object is arranged in the laser printer 1, the side is on the bottom side or<br>
lower portion when viewing the object from the front of the laser printer 1, as situated in FIG. 1. For example, a<br>
first reflective mirror 24 is located in the top or upper portion of the exemplary laser printer 1 and a sheet<br>
pressing member 15 is located in the bottom or lower portion of the exemplary laser printer <br>
[0072] In the following description, an object's width or a width direction refers to a direction or axis<br>
extending from substantially the right side to substantially the left side or from substantially the left side to<br>
substantially the right side, and an object's length or a length direction refers to a direction or axis extending<br>
from substantially the front side to substantially the back side or from substantially the back side to substantially<br>
the front side. Therefore, in the following description, for example, an object's width may be longer than the<br>
object's length, while another object's width may be shorter than that object's length. Further, in the following<br>
description, an object's height or a thickness direction refers to a direction or axis extending from substantially<br>
the bottom side to substantially the top side, or visa versa. Also, in the following description, while a device<br>
may be referred to as roller, the device is not limited to a roller, the device may, for example, be in the form of a<br>
conveyer belt.<br>
[0073] Further, while features may be described as being to the "left", "right", "back", "front" etc., in<br>
no way is it intended for the features to be limited to that arrangement. One skilled in the art would understand<br>
that position/arrangement of the various features may be different from the position/arrangement of those<br>
features described herein. Also, in the following description when something is referred to as "substantially Z",<br>
it is intended to include "exactly Z" and "about Z". With regard to specific distances or sizes, in the following<br>
description, "is Y mm", for example, includes "exactly Y mm" and "about Y mm", unless specified otherwise.<br>
[0074] FIGS. 1 and 2 illustrate cross-sectional views, along the length direction, of an exemplary<br>
laser printer 1, as an exemplary image forming device. The laser printer 1 includes a main casing 2, a feeding<br>
section 4 for feeding a sheet 3, as a recording medium, and an image forming section 5 for forming an image on<br>
the fed sheet 3.<br>
]0075] The main casing 2 has an attachment/detachment cavity 6 and the front cover 7. The<br>
attachment/detachment cavity 6 houses an attachable/detachable process cartridge 20. The process cartridge 20<br>
can be loaded into and unloaded from the attachment/detachment cavity 6 by way of the front cover 7 in order<br>
to be attached to and detached from the main casing 2.<br>
[0076] The front cover 7 is, for example, rotatably supported by a shaft (not shown) in the main<br>
casing 2 such that the front cover 7 may be rotated to allow access to the attachment/detachment cavity 6 or to<br>
cover the attachment/detachment cavity 6. In the exemplary laser printer 1, the shaft is provided at a lower end<br>
portion of the front cover 7. The front cover 7 may, of course, be attachable/detachable in any suitable manner<br>
to allow for the loading/unloading or attachment/detachment of the process cartridge 20.<br>
[0077] The front cover 7 may include projecting portions 351 for reducing, and preferably preventing,<br>
a possibility of an incorrect replacement cartridge (e.g., process cartridge) from being installed. The projecting<br>
porabns 351 project towards the inside of the laser printer 1 when the front cover 7 is closed/attached and the<br>
projecting portions project into receiving portions 352 (FIG. 5) of the exemplary process cartridge 20 when the<br>
process cartridge 20 is attached to the laser printer 1. When the front cover 7 is opened/detached, the projecting<br>
portions 351 do not occupy the receiving portions 352.<br>
[0078] In environments, such as offices, different types of image forming devices may be employed<br>
and thus, many different types of replacement cartridges may be available. Thus, a user may inadvertently<br>
install a replacement cartridge for another type of printer.<br>
[0079] By providing projecting portions 351 that project into receiving portions 352 of the process<br>
cartridge 20 when the front cover 7 is closed, if a process cartridge of a similar size/shape, but without the<br>
receiving portions 352, is installed, when the user attempts to close the front cover 7, the projecting portions 351<br>
may prevent the front cover 7 from closing properly. The user will then know that an incorrect process<br>
cartridge was placed in the laser printer 1 before attempting to print an image.<br>
[0080] Thus, in embodiments including such projecting portions 351 and receiving portions 352, the<br>
front cover 7 may not close if an incorrect process cartridge is installed/arranged because the incorrect process<br>
cartridge may not have corresponding receiving portions 352 for receiving the projecting portions 351.<br>
Although two receiving portions 352 and two projecting portions 351 are illustrated, in some embodiments, no<br>
receiving portions 352 or projecting portions 351 may be provided, while in some embodiments, more than two<br>
receiving portions 352 or projecting portions 351 may be provided.<br>
[0081] Further, in some embodiments, the projecting portions 351 may be provided on the process<br>
cartridge 20 and the receiving portions 352 may be provided on the main casing 2. In some embodiments, each<br>
of the main casing 2 and the process cartridge 20 may include both a projecting portion 351 and a receiving<br>
portion 352.<br>
[0082] The feeding section 4 includes a sheet supply tray 9, a sheet supply roller 10, a separating pad<br>
11, a pickup roller 12, a pinch roller 13, and a pair of resist rollers 14 (e.g., upper resist roller and lower resist<br>
roller).<br>
[0083] The sheet supply tray 9 is attachable/detachable to/from, for example, a bottom portion of the<br>
main casing 2. The sheet supply roller 10 and the separating pad 11 may be arranged in a front end portion of<br>
laser printer 1 at a higher level than the sheet supply tray 9. The separating pad 11 presses against the sheet<br>
supply roller 10 by a force generated by a compression spring (not shown). The pickup roller 12 may be<br>
arranged close to a lower back portion of the sheet supply roller 10 and the pinch roller 13 may be arranged<br>
close to a lower front portion of the sheet supply roller 10.<br>
[0084] The pickup roller 12 and the pinch roller 13 may be arranged substantially symmetrically<br>
about the sheet supply roller 10. The upper and lower resist rollers 14 may be arranged above the pickup roller<br>
12. More particularly, the lower resist roller 14 may be arranged close to an upper back portion of the sheet<br>
supply roller 10 while the upper resist roller 14 may be arranged above the lower resist roller 14.<br>
[0085] The sheet supply tray 9 includes a sheet pressing member 15 that can support a stack of sheets<br>
3 arranged thereon. The sheet pressing member 15 may be in the form of a plate. One end of the sheet pressing<br>
member 15 may be supported by a bottom of the sheet supply tray 9 while the other end of the sheet pressing<br>
member 15 may move upward and downward, as necessary based on a height of the stack of sheets 3 arranged<br>
thereon.<br>
[0086] The sheet pressing member 15 functions to press the stack of sheets 3 upward so that a top<br>
most sheet of the stack of sheets 3 is in compressive contact with the pickup roller 12 such that the top most<br>
sheet 3 can be picked-up by the pick up roller 12 and transported towards the sheet supply roller 10 and the<br>
separating pad 11.<br>
[0087] In the exemplary laser printer 1 shown in FIGS. 1 and 2, a lever 17 is provided to lift and<br>
support the front end portion of the sheet pressing member 15. As shown in FIGS. 1 and 2, the lever 17 may be<br>
substantially L-shaped in cross-section and arranged at a front end portion of the sheet supply tray 9. When the<br>
stack of sheets 3 with a substantially maximum height is arranged on the sheet pressing member 15, a first arm<br>
of the lever 17 is substantially parallel with the sheet pressing member 15 while a second arm of the lever 17 is<br>
substantially perpendicular to the first arm. The maximum height of the stack of sheets 3 may be substantially<br>
equal to the distance between a lowermost point of the pickup roller 12 and an uppermost point of the sheet<br>
pressing member 15, when the sheet pressing member 15 is lying substantially flat (i.e., the front end and the<br>
back end of the sheet pressing member 15 are at substantially a same height from a bottom surface of the laser<br>
printer 1).<br>
[0088] The upper-end-portion of the second arm of the lever 17 is, for example, rotatably supported<br>
by a lever shaft 18 that is provided at the front end portion of the sheet supply tray 9. When the sheet supply<br>
tray 9 is arranged in the main casing 2, a clockwise rotational driving force is applied to the lever shaft 18 such<br>
that as the height of the stack 3 on the sheet pressing member 15 and/or the pressure subjected to the stack of<br>
sheets 3 by the pickup roller 12 decreases, the lever 17 rotates in a clockwise-direction about an axis of the lever<br>
shaft 18, and thereby lifts the front end portion of the sheet pressing member 15 and the stack of sheets 3<br>
arranged on the sheet pressing member 15.<br>
[0089] On the other hand, when the sheet supply tray 9 is detached from the main casing 2 or when<br>
the clockwise rotational drive force is not applied to the lever shaft 18, the front end portion of the sheet<br>
pressing member 15 is not urged upward by the lever 17. Thus, the front end of portion of the sheet pressing<br>
member 15 moves downward such that the sheet pressing member 15 lies substantially flat (i.e., the front end<br>
and the back end of the sheet pressing member 15 are at substantially a same height from the bottom surface of<br>
the laser printer 1). The sheet supply tray 9 may be filled with the sheets 3 by the user when the sheet supply<br>
tray 9 is detached from the main casing 2.<br>
[0090] On the other hand, when the sheet supply tray 9 is attached to/arranged in the main casing 2,<br>
the clockwise rotational driving force is applied to the lever shaft 18 such that the front-end-portion of the sheet<br>
pressing member 15 is lifted by the lever 17 and the top most sheet 3 is pressed against the pickup roller 12.<br>
Rotation of the pickup roller 12 feeds the top most sheet 3 between the sheet supply roller 10 and the separating<br>
pad 11. By rotation of the sheet supply roller 10, the sheet 3 is sandwiched between the sheet supply roller 10<br>
and the separating pad 11 and the sheet 3 is fed to the pinch roller 13.<br>
[0091] By rotation of the sheet supply roller 10 and the pinch roller 13, the sheet 3 is pinched between<br>
the sheet supply roller 10 and the pinch roller 13 and the sheet 3 is then conveyed between the upper and lower<br>
resist rollers 14. The upper and lower resist rollers 14 help further convey the sheet 3 to a transfer position of<br>
the image forming section 5.<br>
[0092] The transfer position is between a photosensitive element, such as a photosensitive drum 92,<br>
and a transfer element, such as a transfer roller 94. At the transfer position, a developer image carried by the<br>
photosensitive drum 92 is transferred, with the help of the transfer roller 94, to the sheet 3.<br>
[0093] The image forming section 5 may include a scanner 19, the process cartridge 20 and a fixing<br>
portion 21.<br>
[0094] The scanner 19 is provided in an upper portion of the main casing 2 and may include a laser<br>
light source (not shown), a rotatable polygonal mirror 22, an fB lens 23, the first reflective mirror 24, a lens 25,<br>
and a second reflective mirror 26. The laser light source emits a laser beam, based on image data corresponding<br>
to an image to be formed, and the emitted laser beam is biased/deflected by the rotatable polygonal mirror 22.<br>
[0095] As shown by the dashed lines in FIG. 1, the deflected laser beam passes through the fB lens 23<br>
before the optical path of the laser beam (dashed lines in FIG. 1) is bent by the first reflective mirror 24. From<br>
the first reflective mirror 24, the laser beam passes through the lens 25 before being bent once more by the<br>
second reflective mirror 26 such that the laser beam irradiates the surface of the photosensitive drum 92, when<br>
the process cartridge 20 is arranged in the main casing 2.<br>
—4 [0096] The process cartridge 20 can be attached and removed with respect to the main casing 2, as<br>
shown in FIG. 2. In some embodiments, portions of the process cartridge 20 may be independently mounted<br>
and removed from the main casing 2. As shown in FIG. 3, the process cartridge 20 may include an<br>
attachable/detachable drum cartridge 27, and an attachable/detachable developer cartridge 28. In various<br>
embodiments, the process cartridge 20 may be attachable to and detachable from the main casing 2 as a single<br>
unit (e.g., the developer cartridge 28 is attached to the drum cartridge 27) and/or portions of the process<br>
cartridge 20 (e.g., the developer cartridge 28, the drum cartridge 27) may be attached to/detached from the main<br>
casing 2 as independently attachable/detachable sub-units (e.g., the developer cartridge 28 being attachable to<br>
the drum cartridge 27 after the drum cartridge 27 is attached to the main casing 2, or the developer cartridge 28<br>
being detachable from the drum cartridge 27 before the drum cartridge 27 is detached from the main casing 2).<br>
As shown in FIG. 8, an installing direction of the developer cartridge is the direction along which the developer<br>
cartridge 28 is moved relative to the attachment/detachment cavity 6 to detachably attach the developer<br>
cartridge 28 to the main casing 2.<br>
[0097] In some embodiments, the developer cartridge 28 may be attached to or detached from the<br>
drum cartridge 27 while the drum cartridge 27 is attached to the main casing 2 and while the drum cartridge 27<br>
is separate from the main casing 2.<br>
[0098] In some embodiments, the developer cartridge 28 may be attached to or detached from the<br>
drum cartridge 27 only if at least a portion of the drum cartridge 27 is removed from the main casing 2.<br>
[0099] In some embodiments, the developer cartridge 28 may only be attached to or detached from<br>
the drum cartridge 27 when the drum cartridge 27 is completely removed from the main casing 2, and thus, in<br>
such embodiments, the process cartridge 20 is always attached to and detached from the main casing 2, as a<br>
single unit.<br>
[0100] FIG. 4 is a cross-sectional view, along the length direction, of an exemplary embodiment of<br>
the developer cartridge 28. As shown in FIG. 4, the developer cartridge 28 includes a developer cartridge<br>
casing 29, as a first casing, a developer supply roller 31, a developer roller 32, as a developer carrying member,<br>
an agitator 46, and a thickness regulating member 33.<br>
[0101] The developer cartridge casing 29 may be formed of a resin material, such as, polystyrene and<br>
may have a generally box-like shape with an open side 8. As shown in FIGS. 4 and 7, the exemplary developer<br>
cartridge casing 29 has the open side 8 that exposes some of the components of the developer cartridge 28 that<br>
are arranged toward the back side of the developer cartridge 28. The open side 8 allows a portion 32A of the<br>
developer roller 32 to be exposed and accessible to the photosensitive drum 92 when the developer cartridge 28<br>
is attached to the drum cartridge 27.<br>
[0102] The developer cartridge casing 29 includes a developer housing section 30, a developer<br>
supplying section 36, and an upper extension section 37, as a first extension portion. The developer housing<br>
section 30 houses the developing agent, such as, toner therein.<br>
[0103] The general shape of the developer cartridge casing 29 is defined by a lower frame 34 and an<br>
upper frame 35. As shown in FIGS. 4-10, the lower frame 34 includes as a single unit, a left side wall 38, a<br>
right side wall 39, a lower wall 40, an upper wall 41, and an upper front side wall 42, an upper wall extension<br>
50, a left side wall extension 52 and a right side wall extension 53. Between the left side wall 38 and the right<br>
side wall 39, the developer housing section 30, the developer supplying section 36 and an upper extension<br>
section 37 are arranged.<br>
[0104] The upper wall extension 50, the left side wall extension 52 and the right side wall extension<br>
53 define the upper extension section 37. The left side wall extension 52 and the right side wall extension 53<br>
extend forward from the left side wall 38 and right side wall 39, respectively. The lower wall 40 and the upper<br>
wall 41 extend substantially perpendicularly to the left side wall 38 and right side wall 39. The lower wall 40<br>
and the upper wall 41 extend between the left side wall 38 and right side wall 39. The lower wall 40 includes,<br>
formample, a back portion 43 and a front portion 44. As shown in FIGS. 4 and 5, the upper front side wall 42,<br>
as a first wall portion, is a wall that extends, for example, downward from a front edge of the upper wall<br>
extension 50.<br>
[0105] In exemplary embodiments, the upper wall 41 defines an upper wall opening 49 along the top<br>
portion of developer cartridge 28. The upper wall opening 49 is covered by the upper frame 35 when the upper<br>
frame 35 is attached to the lower frame 34. The upper wall opening 49 has a substantially rectangular-like<br>
shape, when viewed from the top of the developer cartridge 28, and exposes the developer housing section 30<br>
and at least a portion of the developer supplying section 36 when the upper frame 35 is not attached to the lower<br>
frame 34.<br>
[0106] As shown in FIG. 7, the lower wall 40 is sandwiched between the left side wall 38 and the<br>
right side wall 39. As shown in FIG. 4, the back portion 43 continuously extends from the front portion 44 of<br>
the lower wall 40. The back portion 43 generally corresponds to the portion of the lower wall 40 defining the<br>
lower boundary of the developer supplying section 36, while the front portion 44 generally corresponds to the<br>
portion of the lower wall 40 defining the lower and front side boundaries of the developer housing section 30.<br>
[0107] More particularly, the back portion 43 defines the lower boundary of the developer supplying<br>
section 36 and extends substantially perpendicular to and between the left side wall 38 and the right side wall<br>
39. In the exemplary embodiment of the developer cartridge 28 illustrated in FIG. 4, an inner surface of the<br>
back portion 43 of the lower wall 40 has a wave-like shape, in cross-section along the length direction.<br>
[0108] The inner surface of the back portion 43, when viewed from the left or right side of the<br>
exemplary developer cartridge 28, includes an inclined portion corresponding to the portion of the lower wall<br>
below the developer roller 32, a concave portion corresponding to the portion of the lower wall below the<br>
developer supply roller 31 and a substantially upward extending portion. The substantially upward extending<br>
portion forms a lower partition 55 between the developer supplying section 36 and the developer housing<br>
section 30.<br>
[0109] The front portion 44 includes a front segment 44A and a back segment 44B. The front<br>
segment 44A transitions to the back segment 44B at a bottommost portion 44C of the front portion 44. The<br>
front portion 44 further includes an interior surface 44D, which is an outer boundary of the developer housing<br>
section 30. Opposite from the interior surface 44D is an exterior surface 44E. The back segment 44B of the<br>
interior surface 44D declines downwardly from the lower partition 55. As shown in FIG. 4, the lower partition<br>
55 is provided at the intersection of the back portion 43 and the front portion 44, and has an upside down V-like<br>
cross-section, which partitions the lower front end portion of the developer supplying section 36 from the lower<br>
back end portion of the developer housing section 30.<br>
[0110] As shown in FIG. 4, at least the interior surface 44D of the front portion 44 of the lower wall<br>
40 below the agitator 46 is substantially concave and curves upwardly toward the upper wall 41 along the front<br>
side of the agitator 46. In exemplary embodiments, the uppermost edge of the front segment 44A continuously<br>
connects to the upper wall 41 at the front side of the upper wall opening 49.<br>
[0111] In some embodiments of a developer cartridge according to one or more aspects of the<br>
invention, the outer surface and the inner surface of the walls or frames may have different features (e.g., a cross<br>
sectional shape or texture of an inner surface may be different from a cross sectional shape or texture of an outer<br>
surface). In some embodiments, ribs or supporting members may be provided on the outer surface of the lower<br>
wall 40, as shown for example, in FIG. 4.<br>
[0112] As illustrated in FIGS. 3, 9 and 10, left and right sides of the developer housing section 30 are<br>
defined by corresponding respective portions 38A, 39A of the left side wall 38 and the right side wall 39.<br>
Further, in the following description of exemplary embodiments, a lower portion 30A of the developer housing<br>
section 30 may correspond to the portion of the developer housing section 30 that is below the rotation shaft 59<br>
of the agitator 46 that is housed in the developer housing section 30, and an upper portion SOB of the developer<br>
hoti*ng section 30 may correspond to the portion of the developer housing section 30 that is above the rotation<br>
shaft 59 of the agitator 46 that is housed in the developer housing section 30.<br>
[0113] At least one positioning member 84 may be provided on the developer cartridge 28 such that<br>
when the developer cartridge 28 is attached to the drum cartridge 27, the positioning member 84 helps correctly<br>
position the developer cartridge 28 relative to the drum cartridge 27. In exemplary embodiments, two<br>
positioning members 84 are provided on the bottom most portion 44C of the front portion 44 of the lower wall<br>
40, and the positioning members 84 work in conjunction with protruding portions 118 (FIG. 11) of the drum<br>
cartridge 27.<br>
[0114) In exemplary embodiments, two positioning members 84 are provided on the outer bottom<br>
surface of the front portion 44. The positioning members 84 are flat plate-like portions, spaced apart from each<br>
other along the width direction, on the base of the concave front portion 44 of the lower wall. The positioning<br>
members 84 provide flat surfaces that essentially sit on top of the protruding portions 118 of the drum cartridge<br>
27 when the developer cartridge 28 is attached to the drum cartridge 27. As discussed below, in the exemplary<br>
embodiments, the protruding portions 118 are substantially convex shaped projecting surfaces.<br>
[0115] FIG. 5 is a perspective view from the front-left side of the exemplary developer cartridge 28<br>
illustrated in FIG. 4, and FIG. 6 is a plan view of the exemplary developer cartridge 28 illustrated in FIG. 4. As<br>
shown in FIGS. 5 and 6, the upper wall 41 of the lower frame 34 is substantially flat. The upper wall 41 of the<br>
lower frame 34 extends between the left side wall 38 and the right side wall 39. The upper wall 41 of the lower<br>
frame 34 may further extend outwardly from each of the left side wall 38 and the right side wall 39. The upper<br>
wall 41 connects the upper portions and/or surfaces of the left side wall 38 and right side wall 39.<br>
[0116] A back portion of the upper wall 41, which substantially corresponds to a portion of the upper<br>
wall 41 above the developer roller 32 and the developer supply roller 31, includes a support member 57. As<br>
illustrated in FIG. 3, the exemplary support member 57 of the upper wall 41 protrudes substantially downward.<br>
In exemplary embodiments, the support member 57 may be a planar member that extends in a direction<br>
substantially between the left side wall 38 and right side wall 39 and projects substantially downward toward the<br>
developer roller 32.<br>
[0117] As discussed above, the upper wall 41 defines the upper wall opening 49 that exposes, for<br>
example, a portion of the developer housing section 30 and the developer supplying section 36. Also, as<br>
discussed above, in exemplary embodiments, the upper edge of the front portion 44 of the lower wall 40<br>
connects with the upper wall 41 at the front side of the upper wall opening 49. The upper wall 41 may extend<br>
frontward from the upper edge of the front portion 44 and continuously connect with the upper wall extension<br>
 [0118] The upper wall extension 50 may extend frontward from the front edge of the upper wall 41 to<br>
the upper front side wall 42. In exemplary embodiments, the upper wall 41 may be continuous with the upper<br>
wall extension 50. As shown in FIG. 5, the upper wall extension 50 extends between the left side wall extension<br>
52 and the right side wall extension 53. The upper wall extension 50 may further extend outwardly from each<br>
of the left side wall extension 52 and the right side wall extension 53. The top surface of the upper wall<br>
extension 50 may be substantially flat and the front edge of the upper wall extension 50 may connect to the<br>
upper front side wall 42.<br>
[0119] The upper front side wall 42 may have a substantially planar shape and extend substantially<br>
perpendicularly downward from the front edge of the upper wall extension 50. As shown in FIG. 5, the portion<br>
of the upper front side wall 42 between the left side wall extension 52 and the right side wall extension 53<br>
extends about halfway down the thickness of the developer cartridge casing 29 while the portions of the upper<br>
front side wall 42 extending beyond the left side wall extension 52 and the right side wall extension 53,<br>
respectively, extend downward a smaller amount.<br>
[0120] Protruding members 51 may, for example, extend downward from the lower edge of the upper<br>
side wall 42. In exemplary embodiments, the protruding members 51 extend downward from the lower<br>
edgfiki of the upper front side wall 42 at portions substantially corresponding to front edges of the left side wall<br>
extension 52 and the right side wall extension 53. In exemplary embodiments, the protruding members 51 are<br>
substantially thin rectangular plate-like members that are formed continuously and in the same plane as the<br>
upper front side wall 42. As shown in FIG. 5, ignoring a notch 80, the upper front side wall 42 and the<br>
protruding members 5 1 form an upside-down U-like shape having substantially flat outer surfaces.<br>
[0121] As shown in FIG. 5, the base of the inverted "U" shape is formed by the upper front side wall<br>
42 and a substantially central portion of the upper front side wall 42 may bend inward to form the notch 80, as<br>
discussed below.<br>
[0122] As discussed above, in the exemplary embodiment illustrated in FIG. 6, the left side wall 38<br>
and the right side wall 39 are substantially parallel to each other and are connected via the upper wall 41 and the<br>
lower wall 40. The upper wall 41 and the lower wall 40 extend substantially perpendicular to the left side wall<br>
38 and the right side wall 39.<br>
[0123] The back edges of the left side wall 38 and right side wall 39 may extend to the back edge of<br>
the back portion 43 of the lower wall 40 and the back edge of the upper wall 41 and may define the open side 8<br>
of the developer cartridge casing 29. The front edges of the left side wall 38 and right side wall 39 may extend<br>
to the upper front side wall 42 and/or to the protruding members 5 1 .<br>
[0124] The front side of the front portion 44 of the lower wall 40, which curves substantially<br>
upwardly along the front side of an outer circumferential path of the agitator 46, may be connected to a middlefront<br>
portion of the left side wall 38 and the right side wall 39 so as to define the corresponding portions 38A,<br>
39A of the left side wall 38 and the right side wall 39.<br>
[0125] An inner-surface of the front portion 44 of the lower wall 40 that faces the agitator 46 defines<br>
a front portion of the developer housing section 30. An outer-surface of the front portion 44 of the lower wall<br>
40 that faces the drum cartridge 27 and includes positioning member 84 defines the back boundary of the upper<br>
extension portion 37.<br>
[0126] The upper wall extension 50, the left side wall extension 52 and the right side wall extension<br>
53 (i.e., first pair of side wall extensions) extend continuously and frontward from the outer surface of the front<br>
portion 44 of the lower wall 40. More particularly, the upper wall extension 50, the left side wall extension 52<br>
and the right side wall extension 53 extend substantially perpendicularly from the front portion 44 of the lower<br>
wall 40.<br>
[0127] In some embodiments, the upper extension portion 37 may extend from the left or right sides<br>
of the developer cartridge casing 29 and bend or continue extending at an angle so as to extend beyond the front<br>
portion 44 of the lower wall 40 in the length direction. In some embodiments, the upper extension portion 37<br>
only projects forward beyond the lower wall 40 such that no portion of the upper extension portion 37 projects<br>
upward beyond the upper wall 41 .<br>
[0128] While in the description of the walls and portions provided herein, walls and portions may be<br>
described as being continuously connected/extended, in some embodiments the walls may, for example, be<br>
formed of attached wall portions or segments.<br>
[0129] As shown in FIGS. 4 and 5, the upper frame 35 of the developer cartridge may have a<br>
substantially flat overall shape and the portion of the upper frame 35 corresponding to the developer housing<br>
section 30 may protrude slightly upward to form a slightly convex-like portion. As discussed above, the upper<br>
frame 35 attaches with the lower frame 34 and seals the upper wall opening 49 of the lower frame 34.<br>
[0130] As shown in FIG. 4, the upper frame 35 may include a plurality of ribs 54 along an inner<br>
surface of the upper frame 35. The ribs 54 may extend substantially in the width direction between the left side<br>
wall 38 and the right side wall 39 and be substantially parallel to each other. A predetermined space exists<br>
between adjacent ribs 54.<br>
-A [0131] As discussed above, the lower partition 55 projects upward from the lower wall 40 and<br>
partitions the lower portions of the developer supplying section 36 and the developer housing section 30. The<br>
lower partition 55 may be substantially aligned with an upper partition 56 that projects downward from the inner<br>
surface of the upper frame 35 that faces the developer roller 32.<br>
[0132] As shown in FIG. 4, there is a gap between the upper partition 56 and the lower partition 55.<br>
The gap corresponds to a developing agent passage 58 for supplying the developing agent stored in the<br>
developer housing section 30 to the developer supplying section 36. The upper portion 56 and the lower portion<br>
55 also define the front side of the developer supplying section 36 and the back side of the developer housing<br>
section 30.<br>
[0133] The developer cartridge casing 29 with the features discussed above comprises an internal<br>
space behind the lower partition 55 and upper partition 56. The internal space behind the lower partition 55 and<br>
the upper partition 56 defines the developer supplying section 36. The internal space in front of the lower<br>
partition 55 and the upper partitions 56 defines the developer housing section 30.<br>
[0134] In various embodiments, the developing agent stored in the developer housing section 30 may<br>
be a non-magnetic single component toner that may be positively charged. The toner may be a polymerized<br>
toner that is obtained by copolymerizing polymerizable monomers using a known polymerization method, such<br>
as a suspension polymerization method. A polymerizable monomer may be a styrene-based monomer, such as,<br>
a styrene monomer (e.g., styrene) or an acrylic-based monomer, such as, acrylic acid, alkyl(Cl-C4) acrylate, or<br>
alkyl(Cl-C4) methacrylate. The polymerization process forms substantially spherical toner particles that have<br>
good fluidity such that high quality images can be formed.<br>
[0135] Wax and/or colorants, such as, carbon black may be combined with the toner. To improve the<br>
fluidity of the toner, silica may also be added. In various exemplary embodiments, the average grain diameter<br>
of the toner is about 6 um to about 10 um.<br>
[0136] As shown in FIGS. 9 and 10, in some embodiments, the developer housing section 30 may be<br>
provided with a toner detecting window 85 on each of the left side wall 38 and the right side wall 39 of the<br>
lower frame 34. The toner detecting windows 85 may be arranged on facing lower portions of the left side wall<br>
38 and the right side wall 39 such that the toner detecting windows 85 are opposite to one another.<br>
[0137] When the amount of developing agent in the developer housing section 30 is running low or is<br>
empty (i.e., the developing agent supply is not sufficiently high enough to block a light irradiating one of the<br>
toner detecting windows 85 from passing through the developer housing section 30 and through the other toner<br>
detecting window 85), light from a developing agent low/empty sensor 371 (FIG. 25) passes through both of the<br>
toner detecting windows 85 and a developing agent low/empty signal is triggered. The developing agent<br>
low/empty sensor 371 may be provided in the main casing 2.<br>
[0138] The agitator 46 for agitating the developing agent (e.g., toner) is housed in the developer<br>
housing section 30 and supplies the developing agent to the developer supplying section 36, via the developing<br>
agent passage 58. As shown in FIG. 3, a rotation shaft 59 of the agitator 46 is provided substantially in the<br>
center of the developer housing section 30. The rotation shaft 59 of the agitator 46 is rotatably supported by the<br>
left side wall 38 and the right side wall 39.<br>
[0139] The agitator 46 includes, for example, an agitation member 60 that extends from the rotation<br>
shaft 59 toward the boundaries of the developer housing section 30, as defined by the interior surface 44D of the<br>
front portion 44 of the lower wall 40. The left end of the rotation shaft 59, which is supported by the left side<br>
wall 38, passes through the developing housing section 30 portion 38A of left side wall 38, as shown in FIG. 9.<br>
[0140] In various embodiments, a film (not shown) may be provided at the end portion(s) of the<br>
agitation member 60 such that when the agitation member 60 rotates, the film glides along the interior surface<br>
44Ei of the developer housing section 30 and helps mix the developing agent (e.g., toner) housed in the<br>
developer housing section 30.<br>
[0141] As shown in FIG. 10, a developing agent supply opening 47 may be provided on the right side<br>
wall 39. The developing agent supply opening 47 allows the developer housing section 30 to be filled with the<br>
developing agent (e.g., toner) when the developer housing section 30 is empty. The developing agent supply<br>
opening 47 may be a round opening in portion 39A of the right side wall 39 at a portion corresponding to the<br>
developer housing section 30. A supply cap member 48 may be provided for sealing the developing agent<br>
supply opening 47.<br>
[0142] As shown in FIG. 10, the supply cap member 48 may have a portion that is slightly larger than<br>
the developing agent supply opening 47 such that the portion of the supply cap member 48 overlaps the outer<br>
surface of the right side wall 39 to prevent the developing agent from leaking out of the developing agent supply<br>
opening 47. In some embodiments, the developing agent supply opening 47 may not be provided.<br>
[0143] As shown in FIG. 4, adjacent to the developer housing section 30 is the developer supplying<br>
section 36 of the developer cartridge 28. In the developer supplying section 36, the developer supply roller 31 is<br>
arranged in a front-lower portion of the developer supplying section 36 and extends substantially perpendicular<br>
to the left side wall 38 and the right side wall 39. The developer supply roller 31 may include a supply roller<br>
shaft 62 and a sponge roller 63, which covers the periphery of the supply roller shaft 62.<br>
[0144] The supply roller shaft 62 may be made of metal, and the sponge roller 63 may be made of a<br>
conductive foam. As shown in FIG. 9, in exemplary embodiments, the left end of the supply roller shaft 62<br>
protrudes from left side wall 38 and is rotatably supported by the left side wall 38.<br>
[0145] The developer roller 32 is also arranged in the developer supplying section 36. The developer<br>
roller 32 is arranged behind the developer supply roller 31 in the back-lower portion of the developer supplying<br>
section 36, as shown in FIG. 4. The developer roller 32 and the developer supply roller 31 are in pressure<br>
contact with each other. As shown in FIG. 3, one side of the developer roller 32 projects slightly beyond back<br>
ends 87 of the developer supplying section 36 of the developer cartridge casing 29 and is exposed via the open<br>
side 8 of the developer cartridge casing 29. The back ends 87 of the developer cartridge casing 29 define the<br>
opening 16<br>
[0146] The developer roller 32 comprises a developer roller shaft 64 and a roller 65, which extend<br>
along a direction substantially perpendicular to the left side wall 38 and the right side wall 39. The roller 65<br>
covers at least a portion of the periphery of the developer roller shaft 64. The developer roller shaft 64 can be<br>
made of metal and the roller 65 can be made of a conductive rubber material. The conductive rubber material<br>
may be, for example, a conductive urethane or silicon rubber including carbon micro-grains with a surface<br>
covered with a fluorine-containing urethane rubber or a fluorine-containing silicon rubber.<br>
[0147] The left and right ends of the developer roller shaft 64 protrude from the left side wall 38 and<br>
the right side wall 39, respectively, as shown in FIG. 6. As shown in FIG. 20, the right end of the supply roller<br>
shaft 62 and the right end of the developer roller shaft 64 are rotatably supported by a bearing member 82. The<br>
bearing member 82 may be composed of an insulating resin material and may be arranged in the right side wall<br>
39. A collar member 83 may be mounted to the left end of the supply roller shaft 62 and the left end of the<br>
developer roller shaft 64. In some embodiments, the collar member 83 is provided at both the left end and the<br>
right end of the developer roller shaft 64.<br>
[0148] The collar member 83 is a conductive member that may be composed of a conductive resin<br>
material that maintains the developer supply roller 31 and the developer roller 32 at substantially the same<br>
electric potential. The collar member 83 may be slidably connected to the left end of the developer roller shaft<br>
64 of the developer roller 32 and the left end of the supply roller shaft 62 of the developer supply roller 31.<br>
[0149] The portion of the collar member 83 that covers the left end of the developer roller shaft 64 of<br>
the developer roller 32 functions as a developer roller electrode 76. The developer roller electrode 76 contacts a<br>
devoUoper roller contacting member 175 of the laser printer 1 when the developer cartridge 28 is detachably<br>
arranged in or attached to the main casing 2.<br>
[0150] As shown in FIG. 4, a thickness regulating member 33 is provided within the developer<br>
supplying section 36. The thickness regulating member 33 comprises a flexible member 66 that may be<br>
composed of an elastic/flexible metal plate, and a pressing member 67 on a lower end of the flexible 66. The<br>
flexible member 66 may be in the form of a plate-like member. The pressing member 67 may have a semicircular<br>
or convex shape and may be made of an insulating silicon rubber.<br>
[0151] The thickness regulating member 33 is situated near the developer roller 32. The upper end<br>
portion of the flexible member 66 is supported by the upper wall 41 and/or support member 57 of the upper wall<br>
41 such that the pressing member 67, on the lower end of the flexible member 66, is pressed against the<br>
peripheral surface of the roller 65 of the developer roller 32 by an elastic force of the flexible member 66.<br>
[0152] In exemplary embodiments of the developer cartridge 28, a gear mechanism 45 may be<br>
provided on the left side wall 38, as shown in FIG. 9. FIG. 9 is a left side view of the exemplary developer<br>
cartridge 28 illustrated in FIG. 4, without a gear cover 77. The gear mechanism 45 functions as a driving force<br>
input means for supplying a mechanical driving force to the developer roller 32, the developer supply roller 31<br>
and the agitator 46.<br>
[0153] The gear mechanism 45 includes an input gear 68, an agitator driving gear 69, an intermediate<br>
gear 70, a developer roller driving gear 71, and a supply roller driving gear 72. In various embodiments, a gear<br>
(e.g., the developer roller driving gear 71, the supply roller driving gear 72, the agitator driving gear 69, the<br>
intermediate gear 70) may be in the form of a round plate-like member with a serrated outer edge having an<br>
opening in a center of the plate-like member.<br>
[0154] Such an exemplary gear rotates about an axis that extends in substantially the width direction<br>
and through the opening in the center of the gear. A plane defined by rotation of the round plate-like member,<br>
when the gear is driven, is parallel to or substantially parallel to the left side wall 38 In the following<br>
description, a gear (e.g., the developer roller driving gear 71, the supply roller driving gear 72, the agitator<br>
driving gear 69, the intermediate gear 70) will be referred to as parallel to the left side wall 38 of the plane<br>
defined by rotation of the gear is parallel to the left side wall 38. The serrated outer edges engage with the<br>
serrated outer edges of another gear.<br>
[0155] The input gear 68 functions as a driving force transmitting part and is arranged substantially<br>
parallel to the left side wall 38, on the upper back portion of the left side wall 38. The intermediate gear 70 is<br>
arranged substantially parallel to the left side wall 38. The intermediate gear 70 is arranged to the front and left<br>
of the input gear 68. The intermediate gear 70 engages with the input gear 68.<br>
[0156] The agitator driving gear 69 is provided on the left end of the rotation shaft 59 of the agitator<br>
46. The agitator driving gear 69 is arranged substantially parallel to the left side wall 38. The agitator driving<br>
gear 69 is arranged to the front and right of the intermediate driving gear 70. The agitator driving gear 69<br>
engages with the intermediate gear 70.<br>
[0157] The developer roller driving gear 71 is arranged on the left end of the developer roller shaft<br>
64. The developer roller driving gear 71 is substantially parallel to the left side wall 38. The developer roller<br>
driving gear 71 is to the back and to the left of the input gear 68. The developer roller driving gear 71 engages<br>
with the input gear 68.<br>
[0158] The supply roller driving gear 72 is arranged on the left end of the supply roller shaft 62. The<br>
supply roller driving gear 72 is substantially parallel to the left side wall 38. The supply roller driving gear 72 is<br>
arranged substantially below the input gear 68. The supply roller driving gear 72 engages with the input gear<br>
 [0159] The agitator driving gear 69, the developer roller driving gear 71 and the supply roller driving<br>
gear 72 are integrally rotatable with the rotation shaft 59, the developer roller shaft 64 and the supply roller shaft<br>
62rmjspectively. That is, the agitator driving gear 69, the developer roller driving gear 71 and the supply roller<br>
driving gear 72 are not rotatable with respect to the rotation shaft 59, the developer roller shaft 64 and the<br>
supply roller shaft 62, respectively.<br>
[0160] In a substantially center portion of the input gear 68, a connecting hole 74 is provided, as<br>
shown in FIG. 9. A coupling member 73 (FIG. 26) through which the driving force is inputted, is connected via<br>
the connecting hole 74. The coupling member 73 is connected in such a manner that it is integrally rotatable<br>
with the input gear 68. The coupling member 73 is connected in such a manner that it is not rotatable with<br>
respect to the input gear 68.<br>
[0161] As shown in FIGS. 5 and 8, the gear mechanism 45 may be covered with a gear cover 77 that<br>
is mounted on the left side wall 38. The gear cover 77 may include at least one wall, which extends<br>
substantially parallel to the left side wall 38. The gear cover 77 may comprise a plurality of wall portions which<br>
extend toward the left side wall 38 from the at least one wall. The at least one wall may include one or more<br>
openings. The opening(s) allow access to the various gears (e.g., the input gear 68, the developer roller driving<br>
gear 71, the supply roller driving gear 72, the agitator driving gear 69, the intermediate gear 70) and/or the toner<br>
detecting windows 85 and toner detecting openings 101, As shown in FIG. 8, the gear cover 77 may include an<br>
opening 75 for accessing the input gear 68. The gear cover 77 may include an opening 75 that exposes and<br>
rotatably the input gear 68 so as to permit the input gear 68 to rotate.<br>
[0162] The gear cover 77 also covers all or a part of the intermediate gear 70, the agitator driving gear<br>
69, the developer roller driving gear 71 and the supply roller driving gear 72. The left end of the developer<br>
roller shaft 64 protrudes out beyond the outside surface of the gear cover 77. The developer roller shaft 64<br>
protrudes through the left side wall 38, extends through a space between the left side wall 38 and the gear cover<br>
77 and protrudes out beyond an outside surface of the gear cover 77 in the width direction (i.e., substantially<br>
perpendicular to the left side wall 38).<br>
[0163] A cover extension portion 86 may be provided on an upper front portion of the gear cover 77.<br>
The exemplary cover extension portion 86 projects outward, in the width direction from the gear cover 77, and<br>
also extends in the length direction substantially parallel to the left side wall 38. The cover extension portion 86<br>
partially overlaps the upper portion of the left side wall extension 52 and slightly extends above the upper wall<br>
41.<br>
[0164] As shown in FIG. 13, the cover extension portion 86 is arranged to the left of a left side wall<br>
96 of a drum cartridge casing 91 when the developer cartridge 28 is attached to the drum cartridge 27, as<br>
discussed below. The cover extension portion 86 reduces possible bending of the left side wall 96 of the drum<br>
cartridge casing 91.<br>
[0165] While exemplary embodiments of the developer cartridge 28 include the gear cover 77, in<br>
some embodiments, a gear cover and/or a cover extension portion may be omitted. In some embodiments, the<br>
gear cover 77 and/or cover extension portion 86 may be integrally provided with the developer cartridge casing<br>
 [0166] As shown in FIGS. 5 and 6, in exemplary embodiments, a gripping portion 78 and developer<br>
cartridge bosses 79 are provided in the upper extension portion 37. The gripping portion 78 includes a handle<br>
81 arranged in the notch 80, as a first cutout portion, in the upper extension portion 37. The notch 80 (first<br>
notch portion) is formed along a front-top corner of upper extension portion 37 and extends along a substantially<br>
central portion of the front and top edges of the upper wall extension 50 and the upper front side wall 42,<br>
respectively.<br>
[0167] In exemplary embodiments, the portion of the upper wall extension 50 which adjoins the notch<br>
80 does not extend forward as far as the other portions of upper wall extension 50 forming a substantially "U"<br>
shaped portion when viewed from above. The portion of the upper front side wall 42, which corresponds to the<br>
notch 80, bends inward (i.e., towards the back) following the front edge of the upper wall extension 50 forming<br>
a substantially "U" shaped portion along a substantially front-center portion of the upper wall extension 50.<br>
[0168] As discussed above, in some embodiments the developer cartridge 28 may include the<br>
receiving portions 352 in the front upper corner of the upper extension portion 37. As illustrated in FIG. 5, the<br>
receiving portions 352 may be openings or cutout portions in the upper front side wall 42 and the upper wall<br>
extension 50. Projecting portions 351 project from the front cover 7 of the exemplary laser printer 1 and help<br>
reduce the possibility of an incorrect developer cartridge from being installed/arranged in the main casing 2.<br>
More particularly, the receiving portions 352 are provided at locations that can receive the corresponding<br>
projecting portions 351 when the front cover 7 is closed, which in the exemplary embodiment illustrated in FIG.<br>
5 corresponds to the left-front upper end of the developer cartridge 28. As illustrated in FIG. 2, when the<br>
developer cartridge 28 is being detachably installed/attached to the main casing 2, the developer cartridge 28 is<br>
moved along the installing direction of the developer cartridge and the installing direction of the developer<br>
cartridge may, for example, correspond to a direction along which the width of the developer cartridge 28<br>
extends while the developer cartridge 28 is oriented to enter the attachment/detachment cavity 6 of the laser<br>
printer 1. As shown in FIGS. 2 and 8, in exemplary embodiments, when the developer cartridge 28 is being<br>
detachably attached to the laser printer 1 by moving the developer cartridge 28 along the installing direction of<br>
the developer cartridge, the developer roller electrode 76 may be arranged so as to be downstream of the input<br>
gear 68. That is, in some embodiments, the input gear 68 may be arranged upstream of the developer roller<br>
electrode 76 relative to the installing direction of the developer cartridge 28.<br>
[0169] FIG. 11 is a cross-sectional view, along the length direction, of an exemplary embodiment of a<br>
drum cartridge 27 which is attachably/detachably employable by the exemplary process cartridge 20 and/or the<br>
exemplary main casing 2, illustrated in FIG. 1. FIG. 12 is a front-top-left-side perspective view of the<br>
exemplary drum cartridge 27 illustrated in FIG. 11.<br>
[0170] As illustrated in FIGS. 11 and 12, the exemplary drum cartridge 27 includes the drum<br>
cartridge casing 91, the photosensitive drum 92, as a photosensitive member, a charger 93 (e.g., scorotron type<br>
charger), the transfer roller 94 and a cleaning brush 95. The charger 93 is a scorotron type charger as a charging<br>
means for charging a peripheral surface of the photosensitive drum 92. The transfer roller 94 is a transferring<br>
means for transferring the image developed on the photosensitive drum 92. The cleaning brush 95 is a cleaning<br>
means for cleaning the peripheral surface of the photosensitive drum 92 to remove developer (e.g., toner) left on<br>
the peripheral surface of the photosensitive drum 92 after the developer image is transferred to the sheet 3.<br>
[0171] The drum cartridge casing 91 may be made of a resin material. For example, polystyrene may<br>
be used to form the drum cartridge casing 91. The drum cartridge casing 91 may include the left side wall 96, a<br>
right side wall 97, a bottom wall 98, a lower front side wall 99 and an upper back side wall 100 (as a second<br>
wall portion).<br>
[0172] As illustrated in FIG. 12, the left side wall 96 and the right side wall 97 of the drum cartridge<br>
casing 91 are arranged substantially parallel to each other. A space exists between the left side wall 96 and the<br>
right side wall 97. More particularly, the left side wall 96 and the right side wall 97 are arranged such that an<br>
inner surface of the left side wall 96 faces an inner surface of the right side wall 97. The photosensitive drum 92<br>
is arranged between the left side wall 96 and the right side wall 97. An axis about which the photosensitive<br>
drum 92 rotates is substantially perpendicular to the left side wall 96 and the right side wall 97.<br>
[0173] The drum cartridge casing 91 includes a drum housing portion 102, a developer cartridge<br>
housing portion 103, and a lower extension portion 104.<br>
[0174] Each of the left side wall 96 and the right side wall 97 includes a back side wall portion 105L,<br>
105R, respectively, a front side wall portion 106L, 106R, respectively, and an extension wall portion 107L,<br>
107R, respectively. In exemplary embodiments, the features of each portion (i.e., the back-side wall portion<br>
105L, the front side wall portion 106L and the extension wall portion 107L) of the left side wall 96 differ from<br>
the features of each portion of the right side wall 97 (i.e., the back-side wall portion 105R, the front side wall<br>
porrlbn 106R and the extension wall portion 107R). The features of each portion of the exemplary embodiment<br>
relevant to one or more aspects of the invention will be described below.<br>
[0175] The back-side wall portions 105L, 105R of the left side wall 96 and right side wall 97 may<br>
each include a first wall 108L, 108R, a second wall 109L, 109R, a third wall 110L, 11 OR. The back-side wall<br>
portion 105L of the left side wall 96 may further include a fourth wall 111, a fifth wall 112, a sixth wall 113,<br>
and a seventh wall 114.<br>
[0176] As illustrated in FIGS. 14-17, the first wall 108L of the back side wall portion 105L extends<br>
back from the front side wall portion 106L of the left side wall 96. The second wall 109L may be substantially<br>
parallel to the first wall 108L, while being below and to the right of the first wall 108L.<br>
[0177] The third wall 110L is substantially perpendicular to the first wall 108L and the second wall<br>
109L so as to connect the bottom boundary of the first wall 108L and the top boundary of the second wall 109L.<br>
The fourth wall 111 is substantially parallel to the first wall 108L, and arranged above and between the first wall<br>
108L and the second wall 109L.<br>
[0178] The fifth wall 112 connects a bottom boundary of the fourth wall 111 with an upper boundary<br>
of the first wall 108L. The sixth wall 113 is arranged to the back and to the right of the first wall 108L, the<br>
second wall 109L and the fourth wall 111. The seventh wall 114 connects the second wall 109L, the fourth wall<br>
111 and the sixth wall 113 together.<br>
[0179] In exemplary embodiments, the first wall 108L is the outermost (e.g., leftmost) of the first<br>
wall 108L, second wall 109L, third wall 110L, fourth wall 111, fifth wall 112, sixth wall 113 and seventh wall<br>
114 of the back side wall portion 105L of the left side wall 96. The first wall 108L extends, for example, along<br>
a same plane as the front side wall portion 106L and, when viewed from the side, encompasses substantially a<br>
central portion of the back-side wall portion 105L of the left side wall 96. A top-back portion of the first wall<br>
108L may have a curved shape that substantially corresponds to a shape of a portion of the photosensitive drum<br>
92.<br>
[0180] As illustrated in FIGS. 17 and 18, the second walls 109L, 109R may have inverted triangularlike<br>
shapes and at least a portion of the 'base1 of the triangle-like shaped second walls 109L, 109R connects to<br>
the respective third walls 110L, 11 OR such that the second walls 109L, 109R extend downward from the<br>
respective third walls 110L, 110R. Bottom surfaces of the second walls 109L, 109R may each have a relatively<br>
rounded or pointed portion. As illustrated in FIG. 17, a thickness of each of the second walls 109L, 109R may<br>
be greatest at a substantially middle portion of the second walls 109L, 109R. The thickness of each of the<br>
second walls 109L, 109R may gradually decrease toward the front and back of the second walls 109L, 109R<br>
(i.e., to form an inverted triangle-like shape). The transfer roller 94 is accommodated between each of the<br>

wiretalectrode 131 is fixed so as to be exposed to the outside of the drum cartridge casing 91 from a first slit<br>
111A extending in the up/down direction in the fourth wall 111 of the left side wall 96.<br>
[0221] The grid 129 may be arranged so as to extend below the wire 128 between the left side wall 96<br>
and the right side wall 97 along the width direction of the drum cartridge 28. A grid electrode 132 made from a<br>
member of sheet metal, may be attached to the left end of the grid 129. The grid electrode 132 may be fixed so<br>
as to be exposed to the outside of the drum cartridge 28 from a second slit 11 IB in the fourth wall 111 of the left<br>
side wall 96. In the exemplary embodiment shown in FIGS. 14 and 17, the second slit 11 IB for the grid<br>
electrode 132 in the fourth wall 111 extends diagonally such that a top end of the grid electrode 132 is closer to<br>
the back of the drum cartridge 27 than a bottom end of the grid electrode 132.<br>
[0222] The charger support member(s) 122 may also support the wire cleaner 130. The wire cleaner<br>
130 may substantially sandwich the wire 128 and be slidably supported along the width direction of the drum<br>
cartridge 27. By sliding the wire cleaner 130 along the width direction of the drum cartridge 27, the wire 128<br>
can be cleaned.<br>
[0223] In the drum housing portion 102, the transfer roller 94 may also be arranged below the<br>
photosensitive drum 92. The transfer roller 94 may include a transfer roller shaft 133 made of metal, and a<br>
roller 134 made of an ion conductive rubber material that covers at least a portion of the periphery of the<br>
transfer roller shaft 133.<br>
[0224] FIGS. 23(a), 23(b) and 23(c) illustrate the left end of the exemplary transfer roller 94 of the<br>
exemplary drum cartridge 27 illustrated in FIG. 11. More particularly, FIG. 23(a) illustrates a cross-sectional<br>
diagram along the width direction, FIG. 23(b) illustrates a perspective view in a state where a transfer electrode<br>
137 is being attached to the drum cartridge 27, and FIG. 23(c) illustrates a perspective view where the transfer<br>
electrode 137 is attached to the drum cartridge 27.<br>
[0225] As shown in FIG. 23(a), at the left end of the transfer roller shaft 133, a transfer roller driving<br>
gear 135 may be arranged. In exemplary embodiments, the transfer roller driving gear 135 is not rotatable with<br>
respect to the transfer roller shaft 133. A bearing member 136 may be provided at both the left and right ends of<br>
the transfer roller shaft 133. One of the bearing members 136 may be arranged adjacent to an inner side of<br>
transfer roller driving gear 135. The bearing members 136 are rotatable with respect to the transfer roller shaft<br>
133 and the transfer roller driving gear 135. Each of the bearing members 136 may be supported by a bearing<br>
support member 144 provided on the bottom wall 98 of the drum cartridge casing 91.<br>
[0226] The bearing support members 144 may be in the form of one or more ribs and/or grooves. In<br>
exemplary embodiments, the rib of each of the bearing support members 144 extends substantially<br>
perpendicular to the axis of rotation of the transfer roller shaft 133 along the inner surface of the bottom wall 98.<br>
The right and left ends of the transfer roller shaft 133 may each be rotatably supported by one of the bearing<br>
members 136 that is supported by one or more of the bearing support members 144 on the bottom wall 98.<br>
[0227] The transfer electrode 137 is supported by a transfer electrode holding portion 138 of the drum<br>
cartridge casing 91. As shown in FIG. 23(a), in exemplary embodiments, the left end of the transfer roller shaft<br>
133 projects through the bearing member 136 on the left side and the transfer roller driving gear 135 and<br>
contacts the electrode contacting portion 141 of the transfer electrode 137 supported by the transfer electrode<br>
holding portion 138 of the drum cartridge casing 91. Thus, the transfer roller shaft 133 may be arranged, for<br>
example, such that it extends between the bearing member 136 on the right side and the transfer electrode 137<br>
on the left side of the drum cartridge casing 91.<br>
[0228] The transfer electrode 137 may be made of a conductive resin material and may integrally<br>
include an engaging member 139, a protruding portion 140, and an electrode contacting portion 141 as shown in<br>
FIGS. 23(b) and 23(c). The electrode contacting portion 141 may project away from a substantially central<br>
portion of the inner surface of the engaging member 139. As illustrated in FIG. 23(a), the electrode contacting<br>
portion 141 bulges out from the inner surface of the engaging member 139. The transfer electrode 137 contacts<br>
the-«id surface of the left end portion of the transfer roller shaft 133 via the electrode contacting portion 141.<br>
The engaging member 139 may be a plate-like member that supports the protruding portion 140.<br>
[0229] In some embodiments, the engaging member 139 may be integrally formed with the<br>
protruding member 140. In exemplary embodiments, a transfer electrode opening 142 is a continuous opening<br>
formed by a substantially rectangular cutout in each of the second wall 109L and third wall 110L of the left side<br>
wall 96, as illustrated in FIG. 15. More particularly, as shown in FIGS. 23(b)-(c), the cutout in the third wall<br>
110L may, for example, be smaller than the cutout in the second wall 109L and slightly larger than the<br>
protruding portion 140 such that the protruding portion 140 does not contact the third wall 110L when the<br>
transfer electrode 137 is being attached to the drum cartridge casing 91. The cutout in the second wall 109L<br>
defines the transfer electrode holding portion 138.<br>
[0230] The transfer electrode holding portion 138 of the drum cartridge casing 91 may include a<br>
transfer electrode receiving portion 143, as a receiving portion, for receiving the transfer electrode 137 in the<br>
transfer electrode opening 142. In exemplary embodiments, the transfer electrode receiving portion 143<br>
receives the engaging member 139. More particularly, in exemplary embodiments, to attach the transfer<br>
electrode 137, the transfer electrode 137 is inserted from inside the drum cartridge casing 91 and guided into the<br>
transfer electrode holding portion 138 where the transfer electrode 137 engages with the transfer electrode<br>
receiving portion 143, as discussed below.<br>
[0231] As shown in FIG. 15, the transfer electrode opening 142 is formed to be of a shape and size<br>
that allows the protruding portion 140 to be passed through the third wall 110L when the transfer electrode 137<br>
is inserted into the transfer electrode holding portion 138 of the second wall 109L.<br>
[0232] Further, when the transfer electrode 137 is engaged by the transfer electrode receiving portion<br>
143, the transfer electrode opening 142 remains open because, as discussed above, the transfer electrode<br>
opening 142 is provided to allow the protruding portion 140 to pass the third wall 110L when the transfer<br>
electrode 137 is attached to the drum cartridge casing 91. After the protruding portion 140 passes the third wall<br>
110L, the transfer electrode opening 142 is open (i.e., not covered).<br>
[0233] Thus, the transfer electrode 137 is engaged in the transfer electrode receiving portion 143, as<br>
discussed below, such that the transfer electrode 137 does not slide up and/or out of the transfer electrode<br>
opening 142 and the transfer electrode receiving portion 143 during operation of the laser printer 1.<br>
[0234] The transfer and the transfer electrode receiving portion 143 electrode receiving portion 143<br>
may include, for example, two engaging ribs 145 positioned facing each other on each side of the transfer<br>
electrode opening portion 142. An engaging rib 145 may be provided on the front side of the transfer electrode<br>
opening 142 and another engaging rib 145 may be provided on the back side of the transfer electrode opening<br>
142.<br>
[0235] As illustrated in FIGS. 23(b) and (c) each engaging rib 145 may include a claw portion 147 at<br>
an end thereof. The claw portion 147 may have a hook-like shape. The claw portion 147 helps secure the<br>
transfer electrode 137 in the transfer electrode receiving portion 143 such that the transfer electrode 137 does<br>
not slide or move out from the transfer electrode receiving portion 143.<br>
[0236] In exemplary embodiments, the transfer electrode 137 is arranged in the transfer electrode<br>
holding portion 138, as follows. As shown in FIG. 23(b), first, the engaging member 139, including the<br>
protruding portion 140, is positioned at the transfer electrode receiving portion 143 of the drum cartridge casing<br>
91 by moving the engaging member 139 in a direction substantially perpendicular to the third wall 110L.<br>
[0237] When the engaging member 139 is arranged in the transfer electrode receiving portion 143,<br>
the protruding portion 140 protrudes from the transfer electrode opening portion 142 in the width direction<br>
orthogonal to the second wall 109L. One end of the engaging member 139 is then engaged with the claw<br>
portion 147 of one of the corresponding engaging ribs 145. Then, as illustrated in FIG. 23(c), the engaging<br>
member 139 is rotated such that the other end of the engaging member 139 can be engaged with the claw portion<br>
14?-»f the other engaging rib 145.<br>
[0238] When the transfer electrode 137 is received by the transfer electrode receiving portion 143 and<br>
held at the transfer electrode holding portion 138, the protruding portion 140 protrudes from the transfer electrode<br>
opening 142 outwardly in the width direction so that rotation of the engaging member 139 is regulated, and<br>
preferably prevented, by the engagement of the engaging member 139 in the engaging ribs 145.<br>
[0239] As shown in FIG. 23(a), when the transfer electrode 137 is received by the transfer electrode<br>
receiving portion 143, an end surface of the left end of the transfer roller shaft 33 slidably contacts the electrode<br>
contacting portion 141. In this state, the transfer roller driving gear 135 is arranged such that there is a gap between<br>
an outer surface of the transfer roller driving gear 135 and the second wall 109L in the axial (width) direction so that<br>
the transfer roller driving gear 135 may be free to rotate within the drum cartridge casing 91.<br>
[0240] As shown in FIG. 11, the cleaning brush 95 may be positioned in the drum housing portion 102<br>
and held by the brush supporting members 123. The brush supporting members 123 may be provided on the upper<br>
back side wall 100 at both the left and right sides of the drum cartridge casing 91 behind the photosensitive drum<br>
 [0241] The cleaning brush 95 includes many brush hairs planted on a substantially rectangular bar<br>
shaped holding plate that extends along the width direction. The cleaning brush 95 may be positioned such that it<br>
lies facing the photosensitive drum 92 along the length direction. The brush hairs contact the peripheral surface of<br>
the photosensitive drum 92 such that the peripheral surface of the photosensitive drum 92 can be cleaned. A<br>
cleaning electrode 148 made, for example, from a member of sheet metal is connected to the brush supporting<br>
member 123 on the left side. The cleaning electrode 148 is fixed to the brush supporting member 123 such that it<br>
projects outward from the left side of the drum cartridge 27. In exemplary embodiments, the cleaning electrode 148<br>
projects from a substantially vertical slit formed in the sixth wall 113 of the left side wall 96, as shown in FIGS. 14<br>
and 17.<br>
[0242] hi the exemplary developer cartridge housing portion 103, protruding portions 118, as discussed<br>
above, may be provided, hi exemplary embodiments, each protruding portion 118 contacts one of the positioning<br>
members 84 of the developer cartridge 28. As shown in FIG. 12, in exemplary embodiments, a space exists<br>
between the two protruding portions 118 along the width direction. The two protruding portions 118 are provided<br>
on the front bottom wall portion 194. As shown in FIG. 3, each protruding portion 118 is positioned to face one of<br>
the positioning members 84 of the developer cartridge 28 when the developer cartridge 28 is attached to the drum<br>
cartridge 27. Each protruding portion 118 has a substantially convex upward projecting shape.<br>
[0243] hi some embodiments, the protruding portions 118 may be provided on the developer cartridge<br>
28 while the positioning members 84 are provided on the drum cartridge 27.<br>
[0244] As shown in FIG. 15, bottom ribs 162, as a guide portion for guiding the sheet 3 are also provided<br>
in the developer cartridge housing portion 103. The bottom ribs 162 protrude downward from the bottom surface of<br>
the front bottom wall portion 194. The bottom ribs 162 may include a plurality of back bottom ribs 163 and a<br>
plurality of middle bottom ribs 164.<br>
[0245] The back bottom ribs 163 extend substantially in the length direction. Gaps exist between<br>
adjacent back bottom ribs 163 in the width direction. The plurality of middle bottom ribs 164 may be positioned<br>
more towards the front than the back bottom ribs 163 and may extend substantially in the length direction. Gaps<br>
exist between adjacent middle bottom ribs 164 in the width direction.<br>
[0246] As shown in FIG. 12, in the developer cartridge housing portion 103, toner detecting openings<br>
101, through which light from the developing agent low/empty sensor 371 may pass, are provided on facing<br>
portions of each of the left side wall 96 and the right side wall 97. The position of the toner detecting openings 101<br>
on each of the left side wall 96 and the right side wall 97 of the drum cartridge 27 corresponds to the position of the<br>
toner detecting windows 85 on the left side wall 38 and the right side wall 39 of the developer cartridge 28, as<br>
discussed above.<br>
[0247J Thus, at least a portion of each of the toner detecting windows 85 and the toner detecting<br>
openings 101 are aligned such that light emitted from one side (e.g., left or right side) may pass through each set of<br>
the toner detecting windows and/or openings 85, 101 and be detected at the other side at least when the toner level<br>
is below a predetermined amount.<br>
[0248] As discussed above, when the developing agent low/empty sensor 371 determines that the<br>
amount of toner is below the predetermined amount, in some embodiments, the image forming device may provide<br>
a signal indicating that the toner supply is empty or running low and/or may stop functioning until the toner supply<br>
is replenished.<br>
[0249] Even when the toner level is higher than a predetermined amount/level, some of the light emitted<br>
from one side may pass through the toner detecting windows and/or openings 85, 101 and be received at the other<br>
end. Thus, the toner developing agent low/empty sensor 371 may be set to trigger the toner low/empty signal if<br>
more than a predetermined amount of light is detected at the other side.<br>
[0250] As shown in FIG. 12, the lower extension portion 104 may include a pressing portion 149 and a<br>
drum cartridge boss 150. The drum cartridge boss 150 helps guide and arrange the exemplary drum cartridge 27<br>
and/or the process cartridge 20 in the main casing 2 of the exemplary laser printer 1. In the exemplary drum<br>
cartridge 27, the drum cartridge boss 150 projects from the extension wall portion 107L, 107R of each of the left<br>
side wall 96 and right side wall 97.<br>
[0251] As shown in FIGS. 12 and 17, the drum cartridge bosses 150 may have a cylindrical shape and<br>
may be provided such that they respectively protrude from the extension wall portions 107L, 107R of the left side<br>
wall 96 and the right side wall 97. The drum cartridge bosses 150 may respectively protrude outward, along the<br>
width direction, from the outer surface of the lower-front portions of each extension wall portion 107L, 107R.<br>
[0252] The pressing portion 149 helps press the developer roller 32 towards the photosensitive drum 92<br>
when the developer cartridge 28 is attached to the developer cartridge housing portion 103 of the drum cartridge 27.<br>
In the exemplary embodiment illustrated in FIG. 12, one pressing portion 149 is provided at each of the left and<br>
right sides of the lower extension portion 104.<br>
[0253] In some embodiments, one pressing portion 149 may be provided while in other embodiments,<br>
more than one pressing portion 149 may be provided. Further, in some embodiments including more than one<br>
pressing portion 149, different types of pressing portions may be provided. In some embodiments, a lock lever 153,<br>
as a lock means, for locking or securing the developer cartridge 28 to the drum cartridge 27 after attachment of the<br>
developer cartridge 28 to the developer cartridge housing portion 103 of the drum cartridge 28 may be provided. In<br>
some embodiments, the developer cartridge 28 is released from the drum cartridge 27 by pressing and/or pulling the<br>
lock lever 153.<br>
[0254] FIGS. 21 (a), 21(b), 21(c) and 21(d) compose a general process diagram illustrating a process<br>
of arranging/attaching the exemplary developer cartridge 28 illustrated in FIG. 4 with the exemplary drum<br>
cartridge 27 illustrated in FIG. 11 in order to form the exemplary process cartridge 20 illustrated in FIG. 3. In<br>
the exemplary embodiment illustrated in FIG. 21, the cover extension portion 86 is not shown.<br>
[0255] FIG. 21 (a) illustrates a state where the developer cartridge boss 79 is positioned at an upper<br>
side of the pressing portion 149. FIG. 21(b) illustrates a state where the developer cartridge boss 79 is<br>
contacting an exemplary guiding surface 154 of the pressing portion 149. FIG. 21(c) illustrates a state where<br>
the developer cartridge boss 79 is contacting a border between the guiding surface 154 and a fixing surface 155<br>
of the pressing portion 149. FIG. 21(d) illustrates a state where the developer cartridge boss 79 is contacting the<br>
fixing surface 155 of the pressing portion 149.<br>
[0256] As shown in FIGS. 21(a)-(d), each pressing portion 149 may be provided with a pressing member<br>
151 that engageably and disengageably contacts the respective developer cartridge boss 79 when the exemplary<br>
developer cartridge 28 is attached/arranged in and detached/removed from the exemplary drum cartridge 27. A<br>
sprine 152, as an urging means, may be provided below each pressing member 151 so as to press the pressing<br>
merrifeer 151 up against the corresponding developer cartridge boss 79 on the left and right sides of the drum<br>
cartridge 27.<br>
[0257] The pressing member 151 may be made from a thick, plate-like member having a triangular-like<br>
shape, when viewed from a left or right side of the plate-like member. In exemplary embodiments, the guiding<br>
surface 154 and the fixing surface 155 are continuously formed.<br>
[0258] The guiding surface 154 may incline downward such that a front portion of the guiding surface<br>
154 is at a higher level than a back portion of the guiding surface 154. The fixing surface 155 projects substantially<br>
downward and towards the front of the drum cartridge 27 from the guiding surface 154. Thus, the exemplary<br>
pressing member 151 may have the guiding surface 154 that extends substantially down and back, and the fixing<br>
surface 155 that extends substantially down and front such that the guiding surface 154 and the fixing surface 155<br>
form an obtuse angle. The guiding surface 154 and the fixing surface 155 both face the back of the drum cartridge<br>
casing 91.<br>
[0259] The pressing member 151 may be mounted to the drum cartridge casing 91 by a<br>
mounting/attaching portion 156 that attaches the lower end of the pressing member 151 to the drum cartridge casing<br>
91. The lower end of the mounting/attaching portion 156 may be held movably by a fixing shaft 157 that protrudes<br>
inward (i.e., toward the inside of the drum cartridge casing 91) and substantially in the width direction, from the<br>
extension wall portion 107L, 107R of both the left side wall 96 and the right side wall 97.<br>
[0260] One end of each spring 152 may be fixed to a lower front portion of the bottom extension wall<br>
portion 195. The other end of each spring, as discussed above may be engaged by or pressed against a bottom<br>
surface of the pressing member 151. As shown in FIGS. 21(a)-21(d), in exemplary embodiments, in the various<br>
states of the attachment/detachment process, due to the force exerted by the spring 152 and the arrangement of the<br>
spring 152 in the drum cartridge casing 91, the corresponding pressing member 151 is urged to maintain a reclined<br>
state such that the spring 152 is closer to the front of the drum cartridge 27 than the pressing member 151.<br>
[0261] As illustrated in FIG. 13, the lock lever 153 may be provided on the left end of the lower<br>
extension portion 104. The exemplary lock lever 153 may be provided close to the pressing member 151. The lock<br>
lever 153 may have a base portion with two legs projecting from the base portion where one of the legs is a flexible<br>
member 159 extending substantially perpendicularly from one end of the base portion while the other leg is a<br>
control member 158 that extends substantially diagonally away from the other end of the base portion.<br>
[0262] The control member 158 may be used to move or control the lock lever 153 in order to release the<br>
developer cartridge 28 from the drum cartridge 27. To help release the lock lever 153, the control member 158 may<br>
include a gripping portion (e.g., a ribbed larger/wider area of the control member 158 in FIGS. 12 and 21(a)-(d)) at<br>
one end of the control member 158.<br>
[0263] The base portion of the lock lever 153 may form a contact portion 161 that contacts and "locks"<br>
the developer cartridge boss 79 into place. One side of the contact portion 161 may project, along the width<br>
direction, toward the inside of the developer cartridge 28 so as to provide a surface along which the developer<br>
cartridge boss 79 slides along before sliding around a lower comer of the contact portion 161 and being locked, as<br>
described below by another side of the contact portion 161. As shown in FIG. 18, when the developer cartridge<br>
boss 79 on the left side wall 96 of the developer cartridge casing 28 is locked into place, the developer cartridge<br>
boss 79 on the right side wall 97 may be arranged within a groove 16 of the drum cartridge casing 91. The groove<br>
16 may be provided in the lower extension portion 104 substantially above the upper resist roller 14 on the right<br>
side wall 97 of the drum cartridge casing 91.<br>
[0264] The flexible member 159 may be a thin pin-like member capable of bending and flexing to help<br>
lock and/or release the corresponding developer cartridge boss 79 relative to the drum cartridge 27, as shown in<br>
FIGS. 21(a)-21(d). The flexible member 159 may extend from one end of the base of the lock lever 153 downward<br>
towards the front of the lower extension portion 104. In exemplary embodiments, the lower end of the flexible<br>
member 159 engages, for example, with a rib (not shown) of the drum cartridge casing 91.<br>
-"% [0265] hi exemplary embodiments, when the developer cartridge 28 is in an attached state relative to the<br>
drum cartridge 27 or the developer cartridge 28 is in a detached state relative to the drum cartridge 27, the end of the<br>
flexible member 159 that is attached to the base portion of the lock lever 153 is generally closer to the control<br>
member 158 of the lock member 153 than the other end of the flexible member 159 and the control member 158 is<br>
generally maintained substantially horizontal along the length direction of the drum cartridge 27, as shown in FIGS.<br>
21 (a), 21(b) and 21(d). That is, due to the elastic force of the flexible member 159, the lock lever 153 is generally<br>
positioned such that the top surface of the control member 158 is substantially aligned with the upper wall extension<br>
50, as shown in FIGS. 13 and 19.<br>
[0266] As shown in FIG. 21(c), in exemplary embodiments, when the corresponding developer cartridge<br>
boss 79 is being guided around a boundary between the lock lever 153 and the flexible member 159, the flexible<br>
member 159 bends or flexes such that the end of the flexible member 159 that is not connected to the base portion<br>
of the lock lever 153 moves closer to the control member 158 and pulls the control member 158 so that the<br>
developer cartridge boss 79 can be arranged below the contact portion 161 of the lock lever 153 (see FIG. 21(d)).<br>
[0267] When the developer cartridge boss 79 is arranged below the contact portion 161, as shown in<br>
FIG. 21(d), the pressing portion 149 helps ensure that the developer roller 32 contacts the photosensitive drum 92 as<br>
a result of a pressing force of the spring 152 that presses the developer cartridge 28 back towards the photosensitive<br>
drum 92 of the drum cartridge 27.<br>
[0268] As shown in FIG. 15, the upper resist roller 14 and/or front bottom ribs 165 may be provided<br>
along the outside-bottom of the lower extension portion 104. As discussed above, the upper resist roller 14 may be<br>
used for transferring the sheet 3 toward the photosensitive drum 92. The upper resist roller 14 may be rotatably<br>
provided at the front-end of the middle bottom ribs 164 and such that the upper resist roller 14 extends substantially<br>
in the width direction along the bottom surface of the bottom extension wall portion 195 of the bottom wall 98.<br>
The upper resist roller 14 is rotatable about an axis 14A.<br>
[0269] hi exemplary embodiments, the upper resist roller 14 is positioned between the front bottom ribs<br>
165 and the bottom ribs 162 along the width direction. As shown in FIG. 1, the upper resist roller 14 is positioned<br>
facing the lower resist roller 14 in the upward and downward directions when the drum cartridge 27 is attached to<br>
the main casing 2.<br>
[0270] The front bottom ribs 165 may be provided to help guide the sheet 3 through the laser printer 1.<br>
As shown in FIG. 15, the front bottom ribs 165 may, for example, protrude downward from the bottom surface of<br>
the lower extension portion 104 and extend substantially in the length direction. Gaps exist between adjacent front<br>
bottom ribs 165 in the width direction. The front bottom ribs 165 may be provided at the front side of the upper<br>
resist roller 14. As shown in FIG. 15, the front bottom ribs 165 may be provided across the width direction.<br>
[0271] In some embodiments, where the notch 119 is formed in the bottom extension wall portion 195<br>
and the lower front side wall 99, as discussed above, the bottom extension wall portion 195 may include the first<br>
layer 195A and the second layer 195B. In such a case, the front bottom ribs 165 may be provided across the outside<br>
bottom surface of the second layer 195B (discussed above), of the bottom extension wall portion 195, which<br>
overlaps the notch 119 such that sheet 3 can be guided more effectively.<br>
[0272] hi some embodiments, the front bottom ribs 165 are formed from a material that is different from<br>
the material used to form the drum cartridge casing 91. For example, the front bottom ribs 165 may be formed from<br>
a material that is harder than the material used to form the drum cartridge casing 91 so as to help reduce, and<br>
preferably prevent, damage to the front bottom ribs 165. If, as discussed above, the drum cartridge casing 91 is<br>
made of a resin material (e.g., polystyrene), the front bottom ribs 165 may be made of polyacetal resin. As<br>
discussed above, in the case where the bottom extension wall portion 195 includes the first layer 195A and the<br>
second layer 195B, the first layer 195 A may be formed of the same material as the drum cartridge casing 91 while<br>
the second layer 195B is made of a harder material.<br>
--4 [0273] hi some embodiments, the gaps between respective ones of the front bottom ribs 165, the middle<br>
bottont ribs 164 and back bottom ribs 163 may be arranged so as to improve the guiding of the sheet 3 through the<br>
laser printer 1. In exemplary embodiments, any two or more of the front bottom ribs 165, the middle bottom ribs<br>
164 and back bottom ribs 163 may have substantially the same sized gaps between corresponding adjacent ribs.<br>
Further, in some embodiments, any two or more of the front bottom ribs 165, the middle bottom ribs 164 and back<br>
bottom ribs 163 may have different sized gaps between corresponding adjacent ribs. In exemplary embodiments,<br>
the front bottom ribs 165 and the middle bottom ribs 164 may be aligned in the length direction.<br>
[0274] While the attachment/detachment of the developer cartridge boss 79 to the pressing portion 149<br>
helps ensure the contact between the developer roller 32 and the photosensitive drum 92 when the developer<br>
cartridge 28 is attached to the drum cartridge 27, other portions of the drum cartridge 27 may engage with other<br>
portions of the developer cartridge 28 during attachment and detachment of the developer cartridge 28 to/from the<br>
drum cartridge 27.<br>
[0275] As shown in FIGS. 17, 18 and 20, the left and right ends of the developer roller shaft 64 protrude<br>
outward, in the width direction, beyond the shaft guiding portion 115 of the left side wall 96 and the right side<br>
wall 97 of the drum cartridge casing 91. More particularly when the developer cartridge 28 is received in the<br>
developer cartridge housing portion 103, the collar member 83 provided, for example, at the left and/or right<br>
ends of the developer roller shaft 64 protrude(s) outward, in the width direction, beyond the shaft guiding<br>
portion 115 of each of the left side wall 96 and the right side wall 97 of the drum cartridge casing 91 and the<br>
back side of the collar member 83 contacts the back end of the developer roller shaft receiving portion 116.<br>
[0276] As described above, when the developer cartridge 28 is arranged in the developer cartridge<br>
housing portion 103, the developer roller 32 contacts the photosensitive drum 92. A more detailed explanation of<br>
the attaching/detaching process of the developer cartridge 28 to/from the drum cartridge 27 is provided below.<br>
[0277] hi exemplary embodiments, only one pressing portion 149 is provided. In some embodiments,<br>
more than one pressing portion 149 may be provided. As illustrated in FIG. 21 (a), to attach the developer<br>
cartridge 28 to the drum cartridge 27, the developer cartridge 28 may be positioned, for example, above the<br>
developer cartridge housing portion 103 of the drum cartridge 27 such that the left developer cartridge boss 79 is<br>
positioned at an upper side of the pressing portion 149 and the left and right ends of developer roller shaft 64 are<br>
arranged, for example, on the corresponding shaft guiding portion 115 of the drum cartridge <br>
[0278] As shown in FIG. 21(b), in exemplary embodiments, when the developer cartridge 28 is<br>
gradually pressed down, each of the developer cartridge bosses 79 is moved downward and the left developer<br>
cartridge boss 79 slides on the guiding surface 154 of the pressing member 151. As a result, the pressing member<br>
151 gradually rotates about the fixing shaft 157 such that an upper portion of the pressing member 151 moves<br>
forward against the force of the spring 152 while the left and right ends of the developer roller shaft 64, being<br>
supported by the corresponding shaft guiding portion 115, slide further towards the developer roller shaft<br>
receiving portions 116.<br>
[0279] Next, when the left developer cartridge boss 79 contacts the border between the guiding<br>
surface 154 and the fixing surface 155 of the pressing portion 149, as shown in FIG 21(c), the left developer<br>
cartridge boss 79, while contacting the corresponding contact portion 161, moves further downward while the lock<br>
lever 153 rotates about the holding shaft 160 against the elastic force of the flexible member 159. The control<br>
member 158 moves downward closer to the flexible member 159.<br>
[0280] Also, as shown in FIG. 21(c), when the developer roller 32 contacts the photosensitive drum 92,<br>
the collar members 83 provided at the left and right ends of the developer roller shaft 64 are received in the<br>
corresponding developer roller shaft receiving portion 116 (see FIG. 17). The left developer cartridge boss 79<br>
reaches the border between the guiding surface 154 and the fixing surface 155 of the pressing portion 149.<br>
 [0281] After that, as the front end portion of the developer cartridge 28 is further lowered, the developer<br>
cartridge boss 79 passes between the pressing member 151 and the contact portion 161 of the lock lever 153. As<br>
shovwi in FIG. 21(d), the developer cartridge boss 79, while sandwiched between the fixing surface 155 of the<br>
pressing member 151 and one edge of the contact portion 161, slides around a corner of the contact portion 161<br>
before being "locked" into position between the fixing surface 155 and another edge of the contact portion 161 of<br>
the lock lever 153.<br>
[0282] As shown in FIG. 21(d) after the left developer cartridge boss 79 is "locked" into position, the<br>
control member 158 resumes its substantially horizontal position and/or substantial alignment with the upper wall<br>
extension 50. In this state, a backward pressing force of the pressing member 151 resulting from the spring 152<br>
helps press the developer cartridge 28 towards the drum cartridge 27 such that the developer roller 32 is pressed<br>
against the photosensitive drum 92.<br>
[0283] Also, in this state, because the developer cartridge boss 79 is positioned below the corresponding<br>
contact portion 161 of the lock lever 153, the contact portion 161 engages the left developer cartridge boss 79 such<br>
that the developer cartridge boss 79 cannot move upward unless the lock lever 153 is moved downward to release<br>
the left developer cartridge boss 79.<br>
[0284] From the state shown in FIG. 21(d), to remove the developer cartridge 28 from the developer<br>
cartridge housing portion 103 of the drum cartridge 27, in exemplary embodiments, the control member 158 of the<br>
lock lever 153 may be pressed downward to release the developer cartridge boss 79 from below the contact portion<br>
161.<br>
[0285] When the lock lever 153 is pressed, the lock lever 153 rotates about the holding shaft 160, and the<br>
developer cartridge boss 79 is released as the contact portion 161 positioned above the developer cartridge boss 79<br>
rotates toward the back of the developer cartridge 28. As a result, when the developer cartridge 28 is pulled<br>
upward, the developer cartridge boss 79 is free to moved upward between the contact portion 161 of the lock lever<br>
153 against the backward pressing force of the spring 152 and the pressing member 151.<br>
[0286] After the developer cartridge boss 79 is released from the pressing portion 149, when the<br>
developer cartridge 28 is pulled, both ends of the developer roller shaft 64 unoccupy the corresponding developer<br>
roller shaft receiving portion 116 and the developer cartridge 28 can be removed easily from the developer cartridge<br>
housing portion 103.<br>
[0287] When the developer cartridge 28 is attached to the drum cartridge 27 to form the process cartridge<br>
20, various portions of the developer cartridge 28 connect with and/or align with corresponding portions of the<br>
drum cartridge 27.<br>
[0288] As shown in FIG. 7, the lower wall 40 of the developer cartridge casing 29 may include a<br>
stopper 341 provided at the left and right sides of the lower wall 40. The stoppers 341 may be plate-like members<br>
that project substantially perpendicularly upward from the back end of the lower wall 40. Each of the stoppers 341<br>
engages with a stopper receiving member 244 of the drum cartridge 27, as shown in FIG. 12, when the developer<br>
cartridge 28 is attached to the drum cartridge 27 such that when the stoppers 341 engage with the stopper receiving<br>
members 244, the developer cartridge 28 is prevented from moving further backward relative to the drum cartridge<br>
27. One of the stoppers 341 may be provided at each of the left and right ends of the developer cartridge 28 and one<br>
of the stopper receiving members 244 may be provided at each of the left and right ends of the drum cartridge 27.<br>
The stoppers 341 also help prevent leakage of the developing agent from the developer cartridge 28.<br>
[0289] As discussed above, when the developer cartridge 28 is attached to the drum cartridge 27, each<br>
positioning member 84 of the developer cartridge 28 is positioned on the corresponding protruding portion 118 of<br>
the drum cartridge 27. The upper extension portion 37 of the developer cartridge 28 and the lower extension<br>
portion 104 of the drum cartridge 27 are aligned such that the upper extension portion 37 is arranged above the<br>
lower extension portion 104, as shown in FIG. 13.<br>
[0290] Proper positioning of the developer cartridge 28 relative to the drum cartridge 27, and more<br>
particularly, proper positioning of the developer roller 32 relative to the photosensitive drum 92 of the drum<br>
cartridge 27, may be ensured by the combination of the stoppers 341, the stopper receiving members 244, the<br>
positioning members 84, the protruding members 118, the pressing portion 149 and the developer cartridge boss 79.<br>
|0291] In some embodiments, as shown in FIGS. 7, 8 and 13, a new product detector 301 may be<br>
provided, for example, on the left side wall 38 of the developer cartridge 28. U.S. Patent Application No.<br>
10/891,142 describes in more detail such a detector and the subject matter disclosed therein is incorporated<br>
herein by reference. As shown in FIG. 13, the new product detector 301 may include a contacting lever 302 that<br>
protrudes outward along the width direction from a substantially arc-shaped hole 303 on the gear cover 77. The<br>
contacting lever 302 may be positioned at one end (e.g., front end) of the arc-shaped hole 303 when the<br>
developer cartridge 28 is a new product, and moved by, for example, a new product detecting actuator 374 (FIG.<br>
25) of the laser printer 1, to the other end of the arc-shaped hole 303 when the developer cartridge 28 is used for<br>
the first time. Therefore, based on the position of the contacting lever 302, the new product detector 301 can<br>
detect whether the developer cartridge 28 is new or has been used (a product having history of usage).<br>
[0292] As discussed above, when a new developer cartridge 28 or process cartridge 20 is attached to<br>
the main casing 2, the contacting lever 302 (see FIG. 13) of the new product detector 301 provided on the<br>
developer cartridge 28 contacts the lower end portion of the new product detecting actuator 374, so that the<br>
lower end portion of the new product detecting actuator 374 is pressed rearward by the contacting lever 302. As<br>
a result, the new product detecting actuator 374 rotates counterclockwise, and based on the rotation of the new<br>
product detecting actuator 374, the developer cartridge 28 is determined to be a new product.<br>
[0293] On the other hand, because the contacting lever 302 of the new product detector 301 of the<br>
developer cartridge 28 is moved from one end to the other end of the arc-shaped hole 303, from which the<br>
contact lever 302 projects outwardly when a used developer cartridge 28 is attached to the main casing 2, the<br>
contacting lever 302 of the user developer cartridge 28 does not contact the new product detecting actuator 374.<br>
Thus, the new product detecting actuator 374 does not rotate. Based on this operation, the determination may be<br>
made that the attached developer cartridge 28 is a used product.<br>
[0294] When the process cartridge 20 is installed in the main casing 2, the toner detecting openings<br>
101 of the drum cartridge 27, the toner detecting windows 85 of the developer cartridge 28 and the at least a<br>
portion of developing agent low/empty sensor 371 are aligned, along the width direction, hi addition, the lower<br>
end portion of the resist roller pressing member 372 contacts the left end of the upper resist roller 14 supported<br>
by the process cartridge 20, and the left end portion of the upper resist roller 14 is pressed downward by the<br>
resist roller pressing member 372.<br>
[0295] In exemplary embodiments, when the developer cartridge 28 is attached to the drum cartridge 27<br>
to form the process cartridge 20, the gear mechanism 45 of the developer cartridge 28 at least partially occupies a<br>
space between the pressing portion 149 and the photosensitive drum 92.<br>
[0296] A more detailed description of the left side of the process cartridge 20, which is formed when the<br>
developer cartridge 28 is attached to the drum cartridge 27, will be provided below. As shown in FIG. 17, the<br>
cleaning electrode 148, the grid electrode 132, the wire electrode 131, and the transfer electrode 137 are provided,<br>
for example, on the left side wall 96 of the drum cartridge casing 91. The ground electrode 127 may be provided<br>
such that it extends outward from the left side wall 96, as shown in FIG. 12.<br>
[0297] On the left side wall 38 of the developer cartridge casing 29, the developer roller electrode 76<br>
may be provided such that it extends outward from the developer cartridge casing 29. When the developer cartridge<br>
28 is attached to the drum cartridge 27, the developer roller electrode 76 extends outward beyond the left side wall<br>
96 of the drum cartridge casing 91. Thus, in exemplary embodiments of the process cartridge 20, all of the<br>
electrodes (i.e., the cleaning electrode 148, the grid electrode 132, the wire electrode 131, the ground electrode 127,<br>
the transfer electrode 137, and the developer roller electrode 76) are positioned on the left side of the process<br>
cartridge 20.<br>
[0298] As discussed above, in exemplary embodiments, the gear mechanism 45 is also provided on the<br>
left side wall 38 of the developer cartridge casing 29 and thus the gear mechanism 45 is positioned, for example, on<br>
the-same side of the developer cartridge casing 29 as the above described electrodes (i.e., the cleaning electrode<br>
148, the grid electrode 132, the wire electrode 131, the ground electrode 127, the transfer electrode 137, and the<br>
developer roller electrode 76).<br>
[0299] More particularly, in exemplary embodiments, the above described electrodes and the gear<br>
mechanism 45 are respectively arranged towards the back of the left side wall 96 of the drum cartridge casing 91<br>
and the back of the left side wall 38 of the developer cartridge casing 29, as described above.<br>
[0300] Thus, in exemplary embodiments, the above described electrodes and the gear mechanism 45 are<br>
not respectively arranged on the front side wall portion 106L and the extension wall portion 107L of the left side<br>
wall 96 of the drum cartridge casing 91, and the left side wall extension 52 of the upper extension portion 37 of<br>
the developer cartridge casing 29.<br>
[0301] For example, in exemplary embodiments of the process cartridge 20, all of the above<br>
described electrodes are arranged behind substantially a center (see point C in FIG. 17) of the process cartridge<br>
20 along the length direction. More particularly, in exemplary embodiments, the input gear 68 is arranged<br>
frontmost with respect to the above-described electrodes 148, 132, 131, 127, 137, 76 along the left side of the<br>
process cartridge 20.<br>
[0302] In exemplary embodiments, among all of the above described electrodes (i.e., the cleaning<br>
electrode 148, the grid electrode 132, the wire electrode 131, the ground electrode 127, the transfer electrode 137,<br>
and the developer roller electrode 76), the cleaning electrode 148 is the back-most arranged electrode.<br>
[0303] More particularly, in exemplary embodiments, as described above, the cleaning electrode 148 is<br>
arranged on the sixth wall 113 and thus, is the inner most, along the width direction, of the above described<br>
electrodes because the grid electrode 132 and the wire electrode 131 are provided on the fourth wall 111, the<br>
transfer electrode 137 is provided on the second wall 109L, and the ground electrode 127 and the developer roller<br>
electrode 76 extend out from the first wall 108L. Therefore, in exemplary embodiments, the cleaning electrode 148<br>
is the back-most and the inner-most arranged electrode of the above described electrodes.<br>
[0304] As shown in FIG. 14, in exemplary embodiments, the cleaning electrode 148 is arranged more<br>
inside, along the width direction, than the gear mechanism 45. hi exemplary embodiments, the cleaning electrode<br>
148 is positioned, along the width direction, on the process cartridge 20 outside of an image forming area X where<br>
the image to be formed is formed on the sheet 3 that passes between the photosensitive drum 92 and the transfer<br>
roller 94.<br>
[0305] A description of the relative position of the above described electrodes along the width direction<br>
of the exemplary process cartridge 20 will be described below. As shown in FIG. 14, the developer roller electrode<br>
76 and the ground electrode 127 project out, along the width direction, beyond the first walls 108L, 108R of the<br>
drum cartridge 27. The fifth wall 112, as discussed above, extends inward from the top of the first wall 108L and<br>
connects to the fourth wall 111, where the wire electrode 131 and the grid electrode 132 are arranged. Thus, in<br>
exemplary embodiments, the wire electrode 131 and the grid electrode 132 are arranged more inward than the<br>
developer roller electrode 76 and the ground electrode 127.<br>
[0306] The transfer electrode 137 is arranged on the second wall 109L further inward, along the width<br>
direction, than the developer roller electrode 76, the ground electrode 127, the wire electrode 131 and the grid<br>
electrode 132. As described above, the third wall 110L which extends further inward, than the fifth wall 111, from<br>
the bottom of the first wall 108L connects to the second wall 109L, which is arranged to the right of the fourth wall<br>
111.<br>
[0307] The cleaning electrode 148 is arranged on the sixth wall 113 further inward, along the width<br>
direction, than the developer roller electrode 76, the ground electrode 127, the wire electrode 131, the grid electrode<br>
132, and the transfer electrode 137. As discussed above, the seventh wall 114 extends further inward, from the<br>
fourth wall 111 and the second wall 109L, and connects the fourth wall 111 and the second wall 109L to the sixth<br>
wall 113.<br>
4 [0308] Thus, in exemplary embodiments, the cleaning electrode 148, the transfer electrode 137, the wire<br>
electrode 131, the grid electrode 132, the ground electrode 127, and the developer roller electrode 76 are<br>
sequentially arranged, from right to left, on or in the vicinity of the left side wall 96 of the drum cartridge casing 91.<br>
In exemplary embodiments, the electrodes 148, 137, 131,132, 127 and 76 are also arranged at different points along<br>
the length direction of the drum cartridge casing 91.<br>
[0309] Next, various features of the relationship between the attachable/detachable process cartridge 20<br>
and the main casing 2 will be described. As discussed above, the process cartridge 20 may be attached to or<br>
removed from the main casing 2, as shown in FIG. 2. As shown in FIG. 1, when the process cartridge 20 is<br>
attached to the main casing 2, the drum cartridge boss 150 engages with a positioning member 166 that may be<br>
provided on the main casing 2. The positioning member 166 helps position the process cartridge 20 in the main<br>
casing 2 such that the front end of the process cartridge 20 does not move downward when the back end of the<br>
process cartridge 20 is urged upward by a force generated by the rotation of the photosensitive drum 92 and the<br>
developer roller 32. Thus, the positioning member 166 helps ensure that the process cartridge 20 is properly<br>
arranged within the main casing 2. The positioning member 166 also helps the process cartridge 20 remain in its<br>
attached position within the main casing 2 during an image formation process when forces may urge the process<br>
cartridge 20 to move from its arranged position.<br>
[0310] As shown in FIG. 24, the main casing 2 may include a left frame 167 at the left side of the<br>
attachment/detachment cavity 6. An inner facing side (i.e., the side facing the attachment/detachment cavity 6)<br>
of the left frame 167 may include, for example, a cleaning electrode connecting portion 168, a grid electrode<br>
connecting portion 169, a wire electrode connecting portion 170, a ground electrode connecting portion 171, a<br>
transfer electrode connecting portion 172, and a developer roller electrode connecting portion 173. The cleaning<br>
electrode connecting portion 168, the grid electrode connecting portion 169, the wire electrode connecting portion<br>
170, the ground electrode connecting portion 171, the transfer electrode connecting portion 172, and the developer<br>
roller electrode connecting portion 173 are each connected, via undepicted wiring, to an undepicted power source<br>
(e.g., high voltage power source) provided inside the main casing 2.<br>
[0311] The electrode connecting portions 168, 169, 170, 171, 172 and 173 are provided on the inner<br>
facing side of the left frame 167 such that when the process cartridge 20 is attached to the main casing 2, the<br>
cleaning electrode connecting portion 168, the grid electrode connecting portion 169, the wire electrode connecting<br>
portion 170, the ground electrode connecting portion 171, the transfer electrode connecting portion 172, and the<br>
developer roller electrode connecting portion 173 respectively face and contact the cleaning electrode 148, the grid<br>
electrode 132, the wire electrode 131, the ground electrode 127, the transfer electrode 137 and the developer roller<br>
electrode 76.<br>
[0312] Each of the electrode connecting portions 168, 169, 170, 171, 172 and 173 helps supply power to<br>
or ground the corresponding electrodes 148, 132, 131, 127, 137 and 76.<br>
[0313] The cleaning electrode connecting portion 168 may, for example, be connected to the power<br>
source via a wire. The cleaning electrode connecting portion 168 serves as a connection point for applying a<br>
cleaning bias to the cleaning electrode 148. The cleaning bias may be set to be at or about 400V.<br>
[0314] The grid electrode connecting portion 169 may be connected via a wire to the power source. The<br>
grid electrode connecting portion 169 serves as a connection point for applying a grid voltage to the grid electrode<br>
132. The grid voltage may be set to be at or about 900V.<br>
[0315] The wire electrode connecting portion 170 may be connected via a wire to the power source. The<br>
wire electrode connecting portion 170 serves as a connection point for applying a discharge voltage to the wire<br>
electrode 131. The discharge voltage may be set to be at or about 7000V.<br>
[0316] The ground electrode connecting portion 171 may be connected to the power source via a wire.<br>
The ground electrode connecting portion 171 serves as a connection point for grounding the ground electrode 127.<br>
—4 [0317] The transfer electrode connecting portion 172 may be connected to the power source via a wire.<br>
The transfer electrode connecting portion 172 serves as a connection point for applying a transfer bias to the transfer<br>
electrode 137. The transfer bias may be set to have a maximum at or about -6500V as a positive transfer bias, and<br>
at or about 1600V as a reverse transfer bias.<br>
[0318] The developer roller electrode connecting portion 173 and the developer roller connecting<br>
member 175, discussed above and below, are connected via a wire to the power source. The developer roller<br>
connecting portion 173 serves as a connection point for applying a developing bias to the developer roller electrode<br>
76. The developing bias may be set to be at or about 400V.<br>
[0319] FIG. 25 is a side view of an exemplary internal surface of the left frame 167 of the laser<br>
printer 1. FIG. 26 is a side view of an exemplary internal surface of the right frame 281 of the exemplary laser<br>
printer 1. FIGS. 27(a) and 27(b) respectively illustrate an advanced and a retracted state of the exemplary<br>
coupling member 73 employable by the laser printer 1.<br>
[0320] As shown in FIG. 25, on the inner surface of the left frame 167 (i.e., the surface facing<br>
attachment/detachment cavity 6), a wire electrode contacting portion 271, a transfer electrode contacting portion<br>
272, a developer roller electrode contacting portion 273, a grid electrode contacting portion 274, a cleaning<br>
electrode contacting portion 275, and a ground electrode contacting portion 276 may be arranged in the main<br>
casing 2. The wire electrode contacting portion 271, the transfer electrode contacting portion 272, the developer<br>
roller electrode contacting portion 273, the grid electrode contacting portion 274, the cleaning electrode<br>
contacting portion 275, and the ground electrode contacting portion 276 respectively contact the wire electrode<br>
131, the transfer electrode 137, the developer roller electrode 76, the grid electrode 132, the cleaning electrode<br>
148 and the ground electrode 127 of the drum cartridge 27 when the drum cartridge 27 and/or process cartridge<br>
20 is arranged in the main casing 2.<br>
[0321] The wire electrode contacting portion 271 may, for example, be an exposed portion of a<br>
conductive wire that is connected to the wire electrode connecting portion 170 (see FIG. 24). The wire<br>
electrode contacting portion 271 may, for example, have a substantially U-like shape. At least the base of the<br>
U-like shaped wire electrode contacting portion 271 is exposed and connects to the wire electrode 131 when the<br>
process cartridge 20 is attached to the main casing 2. The arms of the U-like shaped wire electrode contacting<br>
portion 271 are connected to the wire electrode connecting portion 170 and to the undepicted power source (e.g.,<br>
high voltage power source) provided inside the main casing 2, via undepicted wiring. The base of the U-like<br>
shaped wire electrode contacting portion 271 may extend diagonally along the length direction, as shown in FIG.<br>
 [0322] The transfer electrode contacting portion 272 may, for example, be an exposed portion of a<br>
conductive wire that is connected to the transfer electrode connecting portion 172 (see FIG. 24). The transfer<br>
electrode contacting portion 272 may, for example, have a substantially U-like shape. At least the base of the<br>
U-like shaped transfer electrode contacting portion 272 is exposed and connects to the transfer electrode 137<br>
when the process cartridge 20 is attached to the main casing 2. The arms of the U-like shaped transfer electrode<br>
contacting portion 272 are connected to the transfer electrode connecting portion 172 and to the undepicted<br>
power source (e.g., high voltage power source) provided inside the main casing 2, via undepicted wiring. As shown<br>
in FIG. 25, the transfer electrode contacting portion 272 may be positioned below the wire electrode contacting<br>
portion 271. The base of the U-like shaped transfer electrode contacting portion 272 may extend substantially<br>
horizontally along the length direction, as shown in FIG. 25.<br>
[0323] The developer roller electrode contacting portion 273 may be an exposed portion of a<br>
conductive wire that is connected to the developer roller electrode connecting portion 173 (see FIG. 24). The<br>
developer roller electrode contacting portion 273 may, for example, have a substantially inverse broad mouthed<br>
U-like shape. As shown in FIG. 25, in exemplary embodiments, the base and arms of the inverse broad<br>
mouthed U-like shaped developer roller electrode contacting portion 273 are exposed and connect to the<br>
developer roller electrode 76. The lower portions of the arms of the inverse U-like shaped developer roller<br>
electrode contacting portion 273 may be connected to the developer roller electrode connecting portion 173 and<br>
to the undepicted power source (e.g., high voltage power source) provided inside the main casing 2, via undepicted<br>
wiring. As shown in FIG. 25, the developer roller electrode contacting portion 273 may be positioned in front of<br>
the wire electrode contacting portion 271 and the transfer electrode contacting portion 272. The developer roller<br>
electrode contacting portion 273 may also be positioned above the transfer electrode contacting portion 272 and<br>
below the wire electrode contacting portion 271.<br>
[0324] The grid electrode contacting portion 274 may, for example, be an exposed portion of a<br>
conductive wire that is connected to the grid electrode connecting portion 169 (see FIG. 24). The grid electrode<br>
contacting portion 274 may, for example, have a substantially U-like shape. At least the base of the U-like<br>
shaped grid electrode contacting portion 274 is exposed and connects to the grid electrode 132. The arms of the<br>
U-like shaped grid electrode contacting portion 274 are connected to the grid electrode connecting portion 169<br>
and to the undepicted power source (e.g., high voltage power source) provided inside the main casing 2, via<br>
undepicted wiring. As shown in FIG. 25, the grid electrode contacting portion 274 may be positioned to the back of<br>
the wire electrode contacting portion 271 and the transfer electrode contacting portion 272. The grid electrode<br>
contacting portion 274 may be positioned above the transfer electrode contacting portion 272 and below the wire<br>
electrode contacting portion 271. The grid electrode contacting portion 274 may be positioned closer to the wire<br>
electrode contacting portion 271 than to the transfer electrode contacting portion 272. The base of the U-like<br>
shaped grid electrode contacting portion 274 may extend diagonally along the length direction, as shown in FIG. 25.<br>
[0325] The cleaning electrode contacting portion 275 may, for example, be an exposed portion of a<br>
conductive wire that is connected to the cleaning electrode connecting portion 168 (see FIG. 24). The cleaning<br>
electrode contacting portion 275 may, for example, have a substantially U-like shape. At least the base of the<br>
U-like shaped cleaning electrode contacting portion 275 is exposed and contacts the cleaning electrode 148.<br>
The arms of the U-like shaped cleaning electrode contacting portion 275 are connected to the cleaning electrode<br>
connecting portion 168 and to the undepicted power source (e.g., high voltage power source) provided inside the<br>
main casing 2, via undepicted wiring. As shown in FIG. 25, the cleaning electrode contacting portion 275 may be<br>
positioned to the back of the wire electrode contacting portion 271 and the transfer electrode contacting portion 272.<br>
The cleaning electrode contacting portion 275 may be positioned above the transfer electrode contacting portion<br>
272 and below the wire electrode contacting portion 271. The cleaning electrode contacting portion 275 may be<br>
positioned closer to the transfer electrode contacting portion 272 than to the wire electrode contacting portion 271.<br>
The base of the U-like shaped cleaning electrode contacting portion 275 may extend diagonally along the length<br>
direction, as shown in FIG. 25.<br>
[0326] As shown in FIG. 25, the ground electrode contacting portion 276, which the ground electrode<br>
127 contacts when the process cartridge 20 is attached to the main casing 2, may be provided on the inner<br>
surface of the left frame 167. The ground electrode contacting portion 276 may be formed, for example, by<br>
bending a wire into a substantially triangular-like shape, as shown in FIG. 25.<br>
[0327] The ground electrode contacting portion 276 may include a pressing member (not shown) such<br>
as a spring that presses the ground electrode contacting portion 276 upward so as to engage with a ground<br>
electrode receiving portion 323 (discussed below). In exemplary embodiments, the ground electrode contacting<br>
portion 276 connects to the left frame 167 via the ground electrode connecting portion 171 (see FIG. 24).<br>
[0328] The ground electrode contacting portion 276 may be positioned below the wire electrode<br>
contacting portion 271 and above the transfer electrode contacting portion 272. The wire forming the ground<br>
electrode contacting portion 276 connects the ground electrode contacting portion 276 to the ground electrode<br>
connecting portion 171 and to the undepicted power source (e.g., grounding source) provided inside the main<br>
casirvg 2 or a metal portion of the main casing 2, via undepicted wiring.<br>
-A [0329] The left frame 167 may also support other contact portions or members that contact<br>
corresponding portions of the drum cartridge 27, developer cartridge 28 and/or process cartridge 20.<br>
[0330] For example, the coupling member 73 for inputting the driving force for driving the input gear<br>
28 may, for example, be moveably arranged on the inner surface of the left frame 167 above the front side of the<br>
developer roller electrode contacting portion 273 and substantially aligned with the wire electrode contacting<br>
portion 271 along the length direction.<br>
[0331] A drum gear 321 that engages with the photosensitive drum driving gear 191 (see FIGS. 37<br>
and 38) of the drum cartridge 27 and/or process cartridge 20 when the drum cartridge 27 and/or process<br>
cartridge 20 is attached to the main casing 2 may be provided on the inner surface of the left frame 167. The<br>
drum gear 321 may, for example, be provided behind the transfer electrode contacting portion 272 and the<br>
ground electrode contacting portion 276, and below the grid electrode contacting portion 274.<br>
[0332] Further, on the inner surface of the left frame 167, the developing agent low/empty sensor 371<br>
for detecting the empty state of the toner contained in developer housing section 30 of the developer cartridge<br>
28 may be positioned in front of the developer roller electrode contacting portion 273 such that when the<br>
process cartridge 20 is arranged in the main casing 2, the developing agent low/empty sensor 371 is aligned,<br>
along the width direction, with the toner detecting window 101 (see FIG. 35) formed on the left side wall 96 and<br>
the toner detecting window 101 of the right side wall 97 of the drum cartridge casing 91. The developing agent<br>
low/empty sensor 371 may include a light emitting element arranged on one of the left frame 167 and the right<br>
frame 281 and a light receiving element on the other of the left frame 167 and the right frame 281.<br>
[0333] In addition, in front of the developing agent low/empty sensor 371, the resist roller pressing<br>
member 372 may be positioned. When the process cartridge 20 is attached to the main casing 2, the resist roller<br>
pressing member 372 presses the left end of the upper resist roller 14 downward. The resist roller pressing<br>
member 372 may, for example, be formed of a torsion spring that is supported by a shaft 373. The resist roller<br>
pressing member 372 may project inward, along the width direction, from the left frame <br>
[0334] As shown in FIG. 25, the resist roller pressing member 372 may be provided such that one end<br>
extends diagonally upward toward the front side of the laser printer 1, along an electrode guiding surface 322<br>
(described below) while the other end extends diagonally downward toward the front side of the laser printer 1.<br>
[0335] In addition, the new product detecting actuator 374 having a substantially V-shape, when<br>
viewed from a left or right side thereof, is positioned above and between the developing agent low/empty sensor<br>
371 and the resist roller pressing member 372. The new product detecting actuator 374 may be rotatably<br>
supported by a shaft 375 projecting inward, along the width direction, from the left frame 167. The lower end<br>
portion of the of the new product detecting actuator 374 may, for example, be constantly urged towards the front<br>
of the laser printer 1 by a spring (not shown).<br>
[0336] In some embodiments, the left frame 167 may include the electrode guiding surface 322. The<br>
electrode guiding surface 322 may be provided to help guide the ground electrode 127 and the developer roller<br>
electrode 76 during attachment and detachment of the process cartridge 20. The electrode guiding surface 322<br>
may, for example, extend, along the length direction, from the front portion of the main casing 2 to the ground<br>
electrode receiving portion 323. The ground electrode receiving portion 323 may, for example, be provided<br>
close to the ground electrode contacting portion 276.<br>
[0337] When the process cartridge 20 is attached to the main casing 2, the ground electrode 127 and<br>
the developer roller electrode 76 slide along the surface of the electrode guiding surface 322 until the ground<br>
electrode 127 is engaged by the ground electrode receiving portion 323. The ground electrode receiving portion<br>
323 may, for example, be a U-like groove portion that is arranged such that the mouth of the U-like shaped<br>
ground electrode receiving portion 323 faces the front of the laser printer 1.<br>
[0338] The electrode guiding surface 322 may, for example, be an inclined surface arranged such that<br>
the front portion of the electrode guiding surface 322 is closer to the top of the laser printer 1 than the back<br>
portion of the electrode guiding surface 322 where the ground electrode receiving portion 323 is provided. In<br>
addition, the electrode guiding surface 322 is formed so as to extend across the developer roller electrode<br>
contacting portion 273 and the ground electrode contacting portion 276. The developer roller electrode<br>
contacting portion 273 and the ground electrode contacting portion 276 are provided so as to project upward<br>
from the electrode guiding surface 322, as shown in FIG. 25.<br>
[0339] When attaching the process cartridge 20 to the main casing 2, the ground electrode 127 is<br>
guided to the electrode guiding surface 322 until it is received by the ground electrode receiving portion 323.<br>
Before reaching the ground electrode receiving portion 323, the ground electrode connecting portion 171<br>
presses the developer roller electrode contacting portion 273 that is projecting upward from the electrode<br>
guiding surface 322 by pressing the developer roller contacting portion 273 downward in order to pass over the<br>
ground electrode contacting portion 273. The ground electrode connecting portion 171 then presses the ground<br>
electrode contacting portion 276 down toward the electrode guiding surface 322.<br>
[0340] When the ground electrode 127 is received by the ground electrode receiving portion 323, the<br>
ground electrode 127 and/or the ground electrode connecting portion 171 is pressed upward to a back portion of<br>
the ground electrode receiving portion 323 by the pressing member (e.g., spring) of the ground electrode<br>
contacting portion 276. As a result, the ground electrode 127 and/or the ground electrode connecting portion<br>
171 is prevented from being separated from the ground electrode receiving portion 323, and the ground<br>
electrode contacting portion 276 is properly connected to the ground electrode 127 and/or the ground electrode<br>
connecting portion 171.<br>
[0341] Further, the developer roller electrode 76 is guided along the electrode guiding surface 322<br>
passes over the developer roller electrode contacting portion 273 by pressing the developer roller electrode<br>
contacting portion 273 downward. When the process cartridge 20 is attached to the main casing 2 (e.g., the<br>
ground electrode 127 and/or the ground electrode connecting portion 171 is received by the ground electrode<br>
receiving portion 323), the developer roller electrode contacting portion 273 contacts the lower-front portion of<br>
the developer roller electrode 76, and the developer roller electrode 76 and/or the developer roller electrode<br>
connecting portion 173 is pressed diagonally upward toward the upper-back side by a pressing force of the<br>
developer roller electrode contacting portion 273.<br>
[0342] By providing the developer roller electrode contacting portion 273 such that the developer<br>
roller electrode contacting portion 273 contacts the developer roller electrode 76 and/or the developer roller<br>
electrode connecting portion 173 from the lower-front portion thereof, when the process cartridge 20 is attached<br>
to the main casing 2, the space between the developer roller electrode contacting portion 273 and the wire<br>
electrode contacting portion 271 is increased. That is, if the developer roller electrode contacting portion 273<br>
contacted the top portion of developer roller electrode 76 and/or the developer roller electrode connecting<br>
portion 173, then a smaller space would exist between the developer roller electrode contacting portion 273 and<br>
the wire electrode contacting portion 271. Thus, by providing the developer roller electrode contacting portion<br>
273 that contacts the developer roller electrode 76 and/or the developer roller electrode connecting portion 173<br>
from the lower front portion thereof, efficiency and accuracy of the transfer of charge from the developer roller<br>
electrode contacting portion 273 to the developer roller electrode 76 is improved.<br>
[0343] Referring still to the left frame 167, as shown in FIG. 25, a lever driving force transfer gear<br>
277 may be rotatably supported by the left frame 167 such that a front-lower side portion of the lever driving<br>
force transfer gear 277 is exposed. When the sheet supply tray 9 (see FIG. 1) is attached to the main casing 2,<br>
an input gear (not shown) provided in the sheet supply tray 9 engages with the lever driving force transfer gear<br>
277. When the driving force is supplied to the input gear 68 from the lever driving force transfer gear 277, as<br>
discussed above, the lever 17 (see FIG. 1) is rotated by the supplied driving force, and the front end portion of<br>
the sheet pressing member 15 is urged upward by the lever 17. With the lever driving force transfer gear 277<br>
suppWing the input gear 68 with a driving force, the sheet supply tray 9 is prevented from separating from the<br>
main^casing 2 by the engagement of the lever driving force transfer gear 277 and a tray lock member 283<br>
(described below).<br>
[0344] FIG. 26 is a side view of the inner side surface of the exemplary right frame 281 of the laser<br>
printer 1. An inner surface of the right frame 281 faces the right side of the process cartridge 20 when the<br>
process cartridge 20 is attached to the main casing 2. On the inner surface of the right frame 281, a shaft<br>
guiding surface 361 and a drum shaft receiving portion 362 may be provided. The shaft guiding surface 361<br>
guides the right end portion of the drum shaft 125 and the developer roller shaft 64 during attachment and<br>
detachment of the process cartridge 20 to the main casing 2. The drum shaft receiving portion 362 receives the<br>
right end portion of the drum shaft 125 when the drum cartridge 27 and/or the process cartridge 20 is attached to<br>
the main casing 2. In some embodiments, the right end of the drum shaft 125 may also be grounded such that<br>
the both the right and left ends of the drum shaft 125 function as ground electrodes 127.<br>
[0345] The shaft guiding surface 361 and the drum shaft receiving portion 362 may be formed so as<br>
to symmetrically face the electrode guiding surface 322 and the ground electrode receiving portion 323 of the<br>
left frame 167, respectively. That is, the shaft guiding surface 361 may be formed so as to have an inclined<br>
surface and the front portion of the shaft guiding surface 361 may be arranged closer to the top of the laser<br>
printer 1 than to the back portion thereof where the drum shaft receiving portion 362 is provided.<br>
[0346] When the process cartridge 20 is attached to the main casing 2, the right end of the drum shaft<br>
125 and the right end of the developer roller electrode 76 slide along the surface of the shaft guiding surface 361<br>
until the drum shaft 125 is engaged by the drum shaft receiving portion 362. The drum shaft receiving portion<br>
362 may, for example, be a U-like shaped groove portion that is arranged such that the mouth of the U-like<br>
shaped drum shaft receiving portion 362 faces the front of the laser printer 1.<br>
[0347] When mounting the process cartridge 20 to the main casing 2, the ground electrode 127 (i.e.,<br>
the collar member 83) and the left developer roller electrode 76 (i.e., left end portion of the developer roller<br>
shaft 64) are guided on the electrode guiding surface 322 of the left frame 167, while the right end portion of the<br>
drum shaft 125 and the right end of the developer roller shaft 64 are guided on the shaft guiding surface 361 of<br>
the right frame 281. The right end portion of the drum shaft 125 is received by the drum shaft receiving portion<br>
362 at substantially the same time when the ground electrode 127 is received by the ground electrode receiving<br>
portion 323.<br>
[0348] In addition, on the inner surface of the right frame 281, the other of the light emitting element<br>
and the light receiving element of the developing agent low/empty sensor 371 may be provided such that one of<br>
the light element and the light receiving element is provided on the right frame 281 and the other is provided on<br>
the left frame 167. When the process cartridge 20 is attached to the main casing 2, the toner detecting openings<br>
101 of the drum cartridge 27, the toner detecting windows 85 of the developer cartridge and the light receiving<br>
element or the light emitting element of the developing agent low/empty sensor 371 that is provided on the right<br>
frame 281 are aligned, along the width direction.<br>
[0349] On the front side of the developing agent low/empty sensor 371 provided on the right frame<br>
281, a resist roller pressing member 381 may be positioned. When the process cartridge 20 is attached to the<br>
main casing 2, the resist roller pressing member 381 presses the right end of the upper resist roller 14<br>
downward. The resist roller pressing member 381 may, for example, be formed of a torsion spring that is<br>
supported by a shaft 382. The resist roller pressing member 381 may project inward, along the width direction,<br>
from the right frame 281. As shown in FIG. 25, the resist roller pressing member 381 may be provided such<br>
that one end extends diagonally upward toward the front side of the laser printer 1, along the electrode guiding<br>
surface 361 while the other end extends diagonally downward toward the front side of the laser printer 1.<br>
[0350] In a state that the process cartridge 20 is mounted, the toner detecting window 101 on the right<br>
side j&amp;all 97 of the drum cartridge casing 91 and the developing agent low/empty sensor 371 face each other in<br>
the^tidth direction. In addition, the lower end portion of the resist roller pressing member 381 contacts the right<br>
end of the upper resist roller 14 supported by the process cartridge 20, and presses the right end of the resist<br>
roller 14 downwardly.<br>
[0351] Moreover, on the inner surface of the right frame 281, a concave portion 282 that projects<br>
outward (i.e., to the right) from the right frame 281 along the width direction may be formed at the front lower<br>
end portion of the right frame 281. In the concave portion 282, a tray lock member 283 may be provided as a<br>
locking mechanism for preventing separation of the sheet supply tray 9 (see FIG. 1).<br>
[0352] The tray lock member 283 may extend, for example, along the length direction and include,<br>
for example, a curved arm 284 that curves such that the back end portion of the curved arm 284 is directed<br>
towards the inside of the laser printer 1 (i.e., out of the concave portion 282). A contacting area 285 may be<br>
provided at the back end portion of the curved arm 284 and the front end portion of the curved arm 284 may be<br>
rotatably attached to a shaft 286 extending along the thickness direction in the concave portion 282. In addition,<br>
a spring (not shown) is connected to the curved arm 284 such that the contacting area 285 is constantly urged<br>
towards the inside of the laser printer 1 and outside of the concave portion 282, by the force of the spring.<br>
[0353] When the sheet supply tray 9 is mounted to the main casing 2, a lock member engaging<br>
portion (not shown) that projects from the right side of the sheet supply tray 9 contacts the contacting area 285<br>
of the tray lock member 283, and the tray lock member 283 presses the contacting area 285 into the concave<br>
portion 282, against the force of the spring (not shown), such that the lock member engaging portion can pass by<br>
the concave portion 282 and the tray lock member 283.<br>
[0354] When the lock member engaging portion passes by the contacting area 285, the tray lock<br>
member 283 recovers by the force supplied by the spring such that the contacting area 285 projects out from the<br>
concave portion 282 and engages with the lock member engaging portion of the sheet supply tray 9. As a result,<br>
undesired separation of the sheet supply tray 9 from the main casing 2 is prevented.<br>
[0355] In addition, on the inner surface of the right frame 281, a pressing ground contact 287 may be<br>
provided. The pressing ground contact 287 fits into a ground connecting opening (not shown) formed on the<br>
right side surface of the sheet supply tray 9 when the sheet supply tray 9 is attached to the main casing 2.<br>
[0356] Moreover, on the right frame 281, a fan 288 may be positioned at substantially the center<br>
portion, along the width direction, of the right frame 281. The fan 288 helps cool the inside of the laser printer 1<br>
and counteract the heat generated by the process cartridge 20 and the fixing portion 21. The fan 288 may be<br>
positioned so as to be exposed to both the inside and the outside of the right frame 281.<br>
[0357] FIGS. 27(a) and (b) illustrate another exemplary embodiment of a coupling member 73, and<br>
for the explanation of the advancing/retracting operations, (a) indicates the advancing state of the coupling<br>
member 73, and (b) indicates the retracting state of the coupling member 73.<br>
[0358] The coupling member 73 advances to connect to the connecting hole 74 and retracts to<br>
disconnect from the connecting hole 74 (see FIG. 8) of the input gear 68. An arm 291 for advancing and<br>
retracting the coupling member 73 is provided on the left frame 167. The arm 291 includes a first arm 292<br>
extending along the length direction and a second arm 293 provided at the back end portion of the first arm 292.<br>
[0359] The second arm 293 includes a long hole extending along the length direction, and into which<br>
the coupling member 73 may be inserted. As shown in FIGS. 27(a)-(b), the back end portion of the second arm<br>
293 has a thicker side wall than the front end portion thereof. The back end portion of the second arm 293<br>
corresponds to a retracting portion 294 for the coupling member 73 while the front end portion of the second<br>
arm 293 corresponds to an advancing portion 295.<br>
[0360] The arm 291 is movably supported by the left frame 167 such that the arm 291 may move<br>
along the length direction. The arm 291 may move backward when, for example, the coupling member 73 is<br>
engaged by the advancing portion 294 at the back end portion of the arm 291. The arm 291 may provided so as<br>
to move along the length direction with the opening and closing of the front cover 7.<br>
^\ [0361] The coupling member 73 may be positioned to be across from the connecting hole 74 of the<br>
input gear 68 when the process cartridge 20 is attached to the main casing 2. A rotating drive force may be<br>
input to the coupling member 73 from the motor (not shown) provided in the main casing 2. The coupling<br>
member 73 is constantly pressed inward, along the width direction (i.e., towards the attachment/detachment<br>
cavity 6) by a pressing member (not shown), such as a spring.<br>
[0362] During attachment and detachment of the process cartridge 20 to and from the main casing 2,<br>
when the front cover 7 is opened, the arm 291 moves to the front side together with the opening of the front<br>
cover 7. During that time, the retracting portion 294 of the second arm 293 engages the coupling member 73 as<br>
shown in FIG. 27(b). Therefore, the coupling member 73 retracts from the connecting hole 74 of the input gear<br>
68 against the force supplied by the pressing member.<br>
[0363] After attaching the process cartridge 20 to the main casing 2, when the front cover 7 is closed,<br>
the arm 291 moves towards the back. During that time, the advancing portion 295 engages the coupling<br>
member 73 as shown in FIG. 27(a). Therefore, if the process cartridge 20 is attached to the main casing 2, the<br>
coupling member 73 advances into the connecting hole 74 of the input gear 68 by the force supplied by the<br>
pressing member and the coupling member 73 is unrotatably connected to the input gear 68. As a result, when<br>
the driving force from the coupling member 73 is transferred to the input gear 68, the developer supply roller<br>
31, the developer roller 32 and the agitator 46 are rotated by the driving force transferred to the input gear 68.<br>
[0364] As shown in FIG. 24, the coupling member 73 that connects to the connecting hole 74 of the<br>
input gear 68, when the process cartridge 20 is attached to the main casing 2, may be provided on the left frame<br>
167. The coupling member 73 may advance and/or retract, along the width direction, to connect with the<br>
connecting hole 74 of the input gear 68. The coupling member 73 may be provided on a sliding arm 174. The<br>
coupling member 73 can be controlled between the retracted state and the advanced state depending on the position<br>
of the sliding arm 174 relative to the main casing 2, as shown in FIGS. 28(a)-(b).<br>
[0365] The developer roller contacting member 175 may also be provided, for example, on the sliding<br>
arm 174. Depending on the position of the sliding arm 174, the developer roller contacting member 175 contacts or<br>
is disconnected from the developer roller electrode 76.<br>
[0366] As shown in FIGS. 28(a)-(b), the sliding arm 174 may include, for example, a first arm 176 that<br>
extends along the length direction and a second arm 177. hi exemplary embodiments, the second arm 177 is<br>
integrally connected to the back end of the first arm 176. The first arm 176 is substantially perpendicular to the<br>
second arm 177. On the second arm 177, a long hole or groove that extends in the upward and downward<br>
directions may be provided. The coupling member 73 may be inserted into the long hole or groove of the second<br>
arm 177. The long hole or groove allows the coupling member 73 to move from one end to another end of the<br>
second arm 177. The long hole or groove includes a retracting portion 178 and an advancing portion 179. In<br>
exemplary embodiments, the retracting portion 178 is thicker along the width direction than the advancing portion<br>
179. Thus, the retracting portion 178 is capable of sheltering at least a portion of the coupling member 73, as shown<br>
in FIG. 29(a). When the retracting portion 178 of the second arm 177 of the sliding arm 174 is engaged with the<br>
coupling member 73, as shown in FIG. 29(a) the coupling member 73 is pulled outward, along the width direction,<br>
away from the attachment/detachment cavity 6 such that the coupling member 73 is in the retracted state.<br>
[0367] When the advancing portion 179 of the second arm 177 of the sliding arm 174 is engaged with<br>
the coupling member 73, as shown in FIG. 29(b), the coupling member 73 is pushed inward, along the width<br>
direction, toward the attachment/detachment cavity 6 such that the coupling member 73 is in the advanced state.<br>
[0368] As shown in FIGS. 29(a)-(b), the coupling member 73 may be held in the advanced state and the<br>
retracted state based on the outer surface of the second arm 177 which projects outward and is thicker along the<br>
width direction at the retracting portion 178.<br>
[0369] In exemplary embodiments, the coupling member 73 is positioned facing, along the width<br>
direction, the connecting hole 74 of the input gear 68 of the developer cartridge 28, when the process cartridge 20 is<br>
attached to the main casing 2. A rotating driving force from a motor (not shown) provided inside the main casing 2<br>
may be supplied, via the coupling member 73, to the input gear 68 of the developer cartridge 28. Further, in<br>
exemplary embodiments, the coupling member 73 is always urged inward towards the attachment/detachment<br>
cavity 6 by way of a spring 181 (see FIG. 24).<br>
[0370] When the sliding arm 174 moves or rotates, the portion of the long hole or groove of the second<br>
arm 177 that is engaged with the coupling member 73 changes. Depending on whether the aligned portion of the<br>
second arm 177 is the advancing portion 179 or the retracting portion 178, the coupling member 73 is respectively<br>
set in the advanced state or the retracted state. When the retracting portion 178 of the second arm 177 is engaged<br>
with the coupling member 73, the coupling member 73 is pulled outward, against the urging force of the spring 181,<br>
along the width direction, and away from the attachment/detachment cavity 6 by way of the outer surface of the<br>
second arm 177.<br>
[0371] As discussed above, the developer roller connecting member 175 may also be provided on the<br>
sliding arm 174. As shown in FIGS. 28(a)-(b) and 29(a)-(b), the developer roller connecting member 175 may be<br>
provided at an end of the advancing portion 179 of the second arm 177. When the retracting portion 178 of the<br>
second arm 117 is engaged with the coupling member 73, the developer roller connecting member 175 does not<br>
contact the developer roller electrode 76 and is in a disconnected state, as shown in FIGS. 28(a) and 29(a).<br>
[0372] hi exemplary embodiments, when the developer roller connecting member 175 is in the<br>
disconnected state, as shown in FIG. 28(a), the developer roller connecting member 175 is separated from the<br>
developer roller electrode 76 and is located, for example, below the developer roller electrode 76. When the<br>
advancing portion 179 of the second arm 177 is engaged with the coupling member 73, the developer roller<br>
connecting member 175 contacts the developer roller electrode 76 and is in a connected state.<br>
[0373] The developer roller connecting member 175 may be in the form of a cylindrical or semicylindrical<br>
member that at least partially surrounds the developer roller electrode 76 when the developer roller<br>
connecting member 175 contacts the left end of the developer roller electrode 76.<br>
[0374] In some embodiments, the developer roller connecting member 175 may be a projecting platelike<br>
member that contacts the left end of the developer roller electrode 76. In exemplary embodiments, the<br>
developer roller connecting member 175 is, as discussed above, connected to the undepicted power source inside<br>
the main casing 2. As shown in FIG. 28, the developer roller connecting member 175 is provided so as to project<br>
rearward on the lower end of the second arm 177 of the sliding arm 174.<br>
[0375] As shown in FIGS. 28(a)-(b), the front end portion of the first arm 176 of the sliding arm 174<br>
may be rotatably supported by the left frame 167 such that the second arm 177 of the sliding arm 174 can move<br>
substantially up and down. When the first arm 176 rotates about the front end portion, the coupling member 73<br>
slides along the long hole or groove of the second arm 177 so as to be arranged in the retracting portion 178 or the<br>
advancing portion 179.<br>
[0376J In exemplary embodiments, movement or rotation of the sliding arm 174 is based on the opening<br>
and closing of the front cover 7 by way of a link 180 that links the sliding arm 174 to the front cover 7.<br>
[0377] During the installation and removal of the process cartridge 20 into and from the main casing 2<br>
when the front cover 7 is opened, a rear end portion of the first arm 176 is lower with the front end portion being a<br>
fulcrum, synchronizing with the opening of the front cover 7, as shown in FIG. 29(a), and the retracting portion 178<br>
engages the coupling member 73, as shown in FIG. 29(b). As a result, the coupling member 73 retracts from the<br>
connecting hole 74 of the input gear 68 resisting the force applied by the spring 181.<br>
[0378] When the process cartridge 20 is attached to the main casing 2, if the front cover 7 is closed, the<br>
back end of the first arm 176 rises and rotates about the front end of the first arm 176 such that the change in the<br>
state of the coupling member 73 (i.e., retracted state or advanced state), and the developer roller connecting member<br>
175 (i.e., contacting state or disconnected state) is synchronized with the opening and closing of the front cover 7, as<br>
showft in FIGS. 28(a)-(b) and 29(a)-(b).<br>
[0379] As discussed above, when the advancing portion 179 of the second arm 177 is engaged with the<br>
coupling member 73, the coupling member 73 advances into the connecting hole 74 of the input gear 68 by the<br>
urging force of the spring 181 such that the coupling member 73 is unrotatably attached to the input gear 68. In this<br>
state, the rotation driving force from the coupling member 73 may be transferred to the input gear 68.<br>
[0380] As a result of work of the gear mechanism 45 described above, in exemplary embodiments, when<br>
the driving force is transferred from the coupling member 73 to the input gear 68, the driving force is also supplied<br>
to the agitator driving gear 69 via the intermediate gear 70, so that the agitator 46 is driven to rotate.<br>
[0381] In addition, in such a state, in exemplary embodiments, the driving force is transferred from the<br>
input gear 68 to the developer roller driving gear 71 and the supply roller driving gear 72, so that the developer<br>
roller 32 and the developing agent supply roller 31 are respectively driven to rotate.<br>
[0382] In this state, as shown in FIG. 28(b), and as discussed above, the developer roller connecting<br>
member 175 contacts the developer roller electrode 76 by overlapping the developer roller electrode 76 in the width<br>
direction. In such a state, in exemplary embodiments, the developing bias may be applied via the developer roller<br>
connecting member 175 to the developer roller electrode 76 from the power source.<br>
[0383] With regard to the photosensitive drum 92, as discussed above, in exemplary embodiments, the<br>
photosensitive drum driving gear 191 is exposed from the photosensitive drum gear opening 196. When the process<br>
cartridge 20 is attached to main casing 2, the photosensitive drum driving gear 191 engages with a drum gear (not<br>
shown) that is provided in the main casing 2 by way of the photosensitive drum gear opening 196. The drum gear<br>
supplies the driving force, for rotating the photosensitive drum 92, from the motor (not shown) in order to drive<br>
the photosensitive drum 92 to rotate.<br>
[0384] Next, a description of a toner supplying process of the developer cartridge 28 will be provided.<br>
When the process cartridge 20 so attached to the main casing 2, and the gear mechanism 45 is driven by the driving<br>
force of the motor (not shown), the toner in the developer housing section 30 of the developer cartridge 28 is<br>
agitated by the agitator 46. The toner is then discharged from the developing agent passage 58 towards the<br>
developer supplying section 36.<br>
[0385] In exemplary embodiments, the toner discharged from the developing agent passage 58 to the<br>
developer supplying section 36 is supplied to the developer roller 32 by the rotation of the developer supply roller<br>
31. At this time, the toner is positively charged via the developing bias applied to the developer roller 32.<br>
[0386] The toner supplied onto the surface of the developer roller 32 moves between the pressing<br>
member 67 of the thickness regulating member 33 and the developer roller 32 in accordance with the rotation of the<br>
developer roller 32 such that the toner is held on the surface of the developer roller 32 as a thin layer having a<br>
substantially uniform thickness.<br>
[0387] Next, an exemplary process for forming the electrostatic image on the photosensitive drum 92<br>
will be described. The charger 93 generates a grounded discharge by applying the grid voltage and the discharge<br>
voltage, to uniformly and positively charge the surface of the photosensitive drum 92. After uniformly and<br>
positively charging the peripheral surface of the photosensitive drum 92, while the photosensitive drum 92 is<br>
rotating, the surface of the photosensitive drum 92 is exposed by the high-speed scanning of the laser beam from the<br>
scanner 19. An electrostatic latent image corresponding to the image to be formed is formed on the peripheral<br>
surface of the photosensitive drum 92. The portions of the photosensitive drum 92 that were exposed to the laser<br>
beam acquire a lower electric potential than the positively charged unexposed portions of the photosensitive drum<br>
92.<br>
[0388] Therefore, in exemplary embodiments, as the photosensitive drum 92 further rotates, when the<br>
positively charged toner being held on the surface of the developer roller 32 faces and contacts the photosensitive<br>
drum 92 due to the rotation of the developer roller 32, the toner is supplied to the lower potential exposed portions<br>
of the photosensitive drum 92. As a result, the electrostatic latent image on the photosensitive drum 92 becomes<br>
visible, and the toner image, formed by the reverse development process, is held on the peripheral surface of the<br>
photosensitive drum 92.<br>
[0389] Thereafter, in exemplary embodiments, as the photosensitive drum 92 further rotates, for<br>
example, and faces the transfer roller 94, the toner image held on the peripheral surface of the photosensitive drum<br>
92 is transferred to the sheet 3 by the transfer bias applied to the transfer roller 94 while the sheet 3 is transferred by<br>
the resist rollers 14 past the transfer position between the photosensitive drum 92 and the transfer roller 94. The<br>
sheet 3 onto which the toner image has been transferred, is then transferred to the fixing portion 21 which will be<br>
described below.<br>
[0390] After transferring the toner image to the sheet 3, when the photosensitive drum 92 further rotates<br>
and faces the cleaning brush 95, paper dust attached to the peripheral surface of the photosensitive drum 92 is<br>
collected by the cleaning brush 95 when the cleaning bias is applied to the cleaning brush 95 via the cleaning<br>
electrode 148. The toner remaining on the peripheral surface of the photosensitive drum 92 after the image is<br>
transferred to the sheet 3 may be collected by the developer roller 32.<br>
[0391] In exemplary embodiments, the fixing portion 21 is provided behind the process cartridge 20 in<br>
the maing casing 2, as shown in FIG. 1. The fixing portion 21 may include a fixing frame 182 that houses a heating<br>
roller 183 and a compression roller 184. The heating roller 183 may include a tube made of metal and a lamp (e.g.,<br>
halogen lamp) provided inside of the tube. The healing roller 183 may be rotated by the driving force supplied by<br>
the motor (not shown).<br>
[0392] The compression roller 184 may be positioned so as to contact the heating roller 183 from below.<br>
The compression roller 184 may include a roller shaft made of metal and a roller made of a rubber material. The<br>
roller may cover the roller shaft and rotate in accordance with the rotation of the heating roller 183.<br>
[0393] At the fixing portion 21, the toner transferred onto the sheet 3 at the transfer position is heated<br>
and fixed while the sheet 3 passes between the heating roller 183 and the compression roller 184. The sheet 3 to<br>
which the toner has been fixed is further transferred to a paper ejecting path 185 extending in the upward and<br>
downward directions towards the upper surface of the main casing 2. The sheet 3 transferred to the paper ejecting<br>
path 185 may be ejected by a set of paper ejecting rollers 186 to a paper ejecting tray 187 formed on the upper<br>
surface of the main casing 2. The paper ejecting roller 186 may be provided above the paper ejecting tray 187, as<br>
shown in FIG. 1.<br>
[0394] Various features of the various exemplary embodiments of the process cartridge 20 employing<br>
one or more aspects of the invention will be discussed below. In some embodiments, such as the exemplary<br>
embodiment of the process cartridge 20 shown in FIG. 17, because all of the electrodes (e.g., the cleaning electrode<br>
148, the grid electrode 132, the wire electrode 131, the ground electrode 127, the transfer electrode 137, and the<br>
developer roller electrode 76) are positioned on one side (e.g., the left side) of the drum cartridge 27 or process<br>
cartridge 20, along the width direction, a structure of the drum cartridge 27 and/or the process cartridge 20 can be<br>
simplified while a size of the drum cartridge 27 and/or the process cartridge 20 is reduced.<br>
[0395] hi some embodiments, as shown in FIG. 14, among the electrodes (i.e., the cleaning electrode<br>
148, the grid electrode 132, the wire electrode 131, the ground electrode 127, the transfer electrode 137, and the<br>
developer roller electrode 76), the cleaning electrode 148 may be the back-most and the inner-most electrode, along<br>
the width direction. As a result, during attachment/detachment of the process cartridge 20, because the cleaning<br>
electrode 148 may be the back-most electrode, the cleaning electrode 148 passes the electrode connecting portions<br>
169, 170, 171, 172 and 173 of the other electrodes 132, 131, 127, 137 and 76 before aligning with the cleaning<br>
electrode contacting portion 168 along the width direction.<br>
[0396] However, because the cleaning electrode 148 may also be the inner-most electrode along the<br>
width direction, the scratching or rubbing of the cleaning electrode 148 against the electrode connecting portions<br>
169,170, 171,172,173 and 175 is reduced, and preferably prevented.<br>
[0397] By arranging the cleaning electrode 148 innermost of all of the electrodes 132, 131, 127, 137 and<br>
76, a/larger space exists between the cleaning electrode 148 and the electrode contacting portions 169, 170, 171,<br>
172-Tuid 173. Such an arrangement helps reduce, and preferably prevent, contact failure that may result from<br>
rubbing, scratching and loosening of electrodes 148, 132, 131, 127, 137 and 76 against electrode connecting<br>
portions 168, 169, 170,171, 172 and 173.<br>
[0398] In embodiments where the electrodes 148, 132, 131, 127, 137 and 76 are arranged at different<br>
positions along the width direction, the life-span of the drum cartridge 27 and/or the process cartridge 20 can be<br>
increased by reducing and preferably preventing the damage to the electrodes 148, 132, 131, 127, 137 and 76 and<br>
the electrode contacting portions 168, 169,170,171, 172 and 173 that may occur during attachment and detachment<br>
of the drum cartridge 27 and/or process cartridge 20.<br>
[0399] As discussed above, while in some embodiments the cleaning electrode 148 may be the backmost<br>
and the inner-most along the width direction, the cleaning electrode 148 may be positioned outside of the<br>
image forming area X so that the image forming area X is not obstructed relative to the sheet 3 due to the cleaning<br>
electrode 148. Thus, contact failure of the cleaning electrode 148 can be suppressed while accurate image formation<br>
is achieved.<br>
[0400] hi some embodiments, if the cleaning electrode 148 is the back-most electrode, the cleaning<br>
brush 95 may be positioned behind the photosensitive drum 92 (i.e., downstream of the transfer position, based on<br>
the direction of rotation of the photosensitive drum 92, where the photosensitive drum 92 and the transfer roller 94<br>
face each other). As a result, the cleaning brush 95 may be secured downstream of the image forming area X.<br>
[0401] hi some embodiments employing one or more aspects of the invention, as discussed above, the<br>
gear mechanism 45 may also be positioned on the same side (e.g., left side) as all of the electrodes 148, 132, 131,<br>
127, 137 and 76. hi such embodiments, a structure of the drum cartridge 27 and/or the process cartridge 20 can be<br>
simplified while a size of the drum cartridge 27 and/or the process cartridge 20 is reduced.<br>
[0402] As discussed above, the gear mechanism 45 may be positioned towards the front of the left side<br>
wall 96 of the drum cartridge 27, while all of the electrodes 148, 132, 131, 127, 137 and 76 may be positioned<br>
toward the back of the left side wall 96 of the drum cartridge 27. Thus, the simplification and miniaturization of the<br>
drum cartridge 27 and/or the process cartridge 20 is possible.<br>
[0403] hi some embodiments, all of the electrodes 148, 132, 131, 127, 137 and 76 may be positioned<br>
behind the input gear 68 of the gear mechanism 45. Thus, while the driving force may be supplied to the input gear<br>
68 via the coupling member 73 attached to the sliding arm 174, the coupling member 73 and the sliding arm 174 do<br>
not interfere with the electrodes 148, 132, 131, 127, 137 and 76 because the coupling member 73 and the sliding<br>
arm 174 are provided to the front of the input gear 68.<br>
[0404] Thus, damage that could occur to the electrodes 148,132, 131, 127, 137 and 76 by the movement<br>
of the coupling member 73 and the sliding arm 174 is avoided, and accurate positioning of the electrodes 148, 132,<br>
131,127, 137 and 76 on the drum cartridge 27 can be maintained while a stable driving force for driving the process<br>
cartridge 20 may be provided to the process cartridge 20 via the coupling member 73.<br>
[0405] hi some embodiments employing one or more aspects of the invention, although all of the<br>
electrodes 148,132, 131, 127, 137 and 76 and the gear mechanism 45 are positioned on the same side (e.g. left side)<br>
of the process cartridge 20, all of the electrodes 148, 132, 131, 127, 137 and 76 are positioned to the back of the<br>
gear mechanism 45 so that contamination of the electrodes 148, 132, 131, 127, 137 and 76 by grease and dust<br>
generated by the gear mechanism 45 is reduced, and preferably prevented.<br>
[0406] hi some embodiments, contamination of at least some of the electrodes 148, 132, 131, 127, 137<br>
and 76 may be further prevented by positioning at least some of the electrodes 148, 132, 131, and 137 to the right<br>
side of the gear mechanism 45 such that those electrodes can be further protected from the dust, grease, etc.<br>
generated by the gear mechanism 45. For example, in the exemplary embodiment described above, the cleaning<br>
electrode 148 is more sheltered from the dust, grease, etc. that is generated by the gear mechanism 45 than the other<br>
electrodes 132, 131, 127, 137 and 76 because the cleaning electrode 148 is arranged innermost of all of the<br>
electrodes 132, 131,127, 137 and 76.<br>
-""4 [0407] In some embodiments of one or more aspects of the invention, the developing agent supply<br>
opening 47 may be provided on a different side (e.g., right side) of the process cartridge 20 than the side (e.g.,<br>
left side) on which the electrodes 148, 132, 131, 127, 137 and 76 are positioned, hi the exemplary embodiment<br>
illustrated in FIG. 10, the developing agent supply opening 47 is provided on the right side wall 39 of the developer<br>
cartridge 28. In such an embodiment, contamination of the electrodes 148, 132, 131, 127,137 and 76 by leakage of<br>
the developing agent, is reduced, and preferably eliminated.<br>
[0408] hi embodiments, the cleaning electrode 148, the transfer electrode 137, the wire electrode 131,<br>
the grid electrode 132, the ground electrode 127 and the developer roller electrode 76 are sequentially arranged,<br>
from right to left on the left side wall 96 of the drum cartridge casing 91. hi further embodiments, the cleaning<br>
electrode 148, the transfer electrode 137, the wire electrode 131, the grid electrode 132, the ground electrode 127<br>
and the developer roller electrode 76 are sequentially arranged, from back to front on the left side wall 96 of the<br>
drum cartridge casing 91.<br>
[0409J As shown in FIG. 14, the electrodes 148, 137, 131, 132, 127 and 76 may also be arranged at<br>
different points along the width and length directions due to the arrangement of the third wall 110L, the fifth wall<br>
112, and the seventh wall 114 which extend inward along the width direction and serve as connecting walls for<br>
connecting the various walls 108L, 109L, 111, 113 on which the electrodes 148, 137, 131, 132, 127 and 76 are<br>
arranged.<br>
[0410J The distances between the electrodes 148, 137, 131, 132, 127 and 76 help reduce, and preferably<br>
prevent, leaks or shorts between the electrodes 148, 137, 131, 132, 127 and 76 while allowing miniaturization of the<br>
process cartridge 20. For example, leaks or shorts between the developer roller electrode 76 and the wire electrode<br>
131 are reduced and preferably prevented by the fifth wall 112 which separates the developer roller electrode 76<br>
and the wire electrode 131 along the width direction.<br>
[0411] hi some embodiments of the process cartridge 20, such as the exemplary embodiment shown in<br>
FIG. 23(b), the transfer electrode 137 includes the protruding portion 140 that protrudes outward along the width<br>
direction and is received by the transfer electrode opening 142, when the engaging member 139 is engaged by the<br>
transfer electrode holding portion 138. As shown in FIGS. 23(b)-(c), in exemplary embodiments, the transfer<br>
electrode 137 is attached to the drum cartridge casing 91 by inserting the engaging member 139 into the transfer<br>
electrode receiving portion 143 of the drum cartridge casing 91 from inside the drum cartridge casing 91 such that<br>
the engaging member 139 is arranged substantially perpendicular to the third wall 110L.<br>
[0412] More particularly, in some embodiments, such as the exemplary embodiment shown in FIG.<br>
23(c), the engaging member 139 is received by the transfer electrode receiving portion 143 by engaging one end of<br>
the engaging member 139 with the claw portion 147 of the respective engaging rib 145 and then rotating the<br>
engaging member 139 about the protruding portion 140 to engage the other end of the engaging member 139 with<br>
the claw portion 147 of the other engaging rib 145. As a result, the transfer electrode 137 can be easily and<br>
accurately positioned in the drum cartridge casing 91. Also, the engaging member 139 which may include, for<br>
example the protruding portion 140 and the electrode contacting portion 141 is prevented from rotating by way of<br>
the engaging ribs 145 and the claw portions 147.<br>
[0413] When the transfer electrode 137 is arranged in the drum cartridge casing 91, as shown, for<br>
example, in FIG. 23(a), the left end of the transfer roller shaft 133 contacts the electrode contacting portion 141 of<br>
the transfer electrode 137. hi exemplary embodiments, the transfer roller driving gear 135 is arranged inside of the<br>
drum cartridge casing 91 (i.e., to the right of the second wall 109L) and such that a predetermined distance exists<br>
between the second wall 109L and the transfer roller driving gear 135.<br>
[0414] Also, in exemplary embodiments, the transfer roller 137 is arranged on the second wall 109L that<br>
is positioned to the right of the first wall 108L of the back-side wall portion 105L of the left side wall 96 of the<br>
drum cartridge 27. Thus, both the transfer electrode 137 and the transfer roller driving gear 135 are arranged to<br>
the right of the first wall 108L and are therefore sheltered from damage that can occur by rubbing or scratching<br>
duriag attachment/detachment of the process cartridge 20 to the main casing 2.<br>
[0415] Referring to the developer cartridge 28 of the process cartridge 20, as shown in FIG. 20, the right<br>
end of the supply roller shaft 62 and the right end of the developer roller shaft 64 are rotatably held by the bearing<br>
member 82 made, for example, from an insulating resin material while the left end of the supply roller shaft 62 and<br>
the left end of the developer roller shaft 64 are mounted with the collar member 83 made, for example, from a<br>
conductive resin material.<br>
[0416] By connecting the developer roller shaft 64 and the supply roller shaft 62 to the conductive collar<br>
member 83, the developer supply roller 31 and the developer roller 32 may be maintained at the same electric<br>
potential. Thus, the bearing member 82 that supports the right ends of the supply roller shaft 62 and the developer<br>
roller 64 can be made large to increase the positioning accuracy and the rotational stability of the supply roller 31<br>
and the developer roller 32. Such a bearing member 82 may also be formed using inexpensive insulating material<br>
to help reduce the manufacturing cost of the developer cartridge 28 and/or process cartridge 20.<br>
[0417] As discussed above, in some embodiments, the developer cartridge 28 may include the gear cover<br>
77. As shown in FIG. 5, the gear cover 77 may cover at least portions of the input gear 68, the agitator driving gear<br>
69, the intermediate gear 70, the developer roller driving gear 71, and the supply roller driving gear 72. Thus, the<br>
gear cover 77 helps protect the gears 68, 69, 70, 71, and 72 from damage that may occur when the developer<br>
cartridge 28 and/or the process cartridge 20 is being attached to and detached from the main casing 2.<br>
[0418] Further, in exemplary embodiments, the gear cover 77 supports the gears 68, 69, 70, 71, and 72 as<br>
well as the left end of the developer roller shaft 64. Thus, the positioning accuracy of the developer roller 32 and<br>
gears 68, 69, 70, 71, and 72 can be further ensured. As a result, a stable driving force can be applied to the<br>
developer cartridge 28, while reducing the number of parts of the developer cartridge 28 and simplifying the<br>
structure of the developer cartridge 28.<br>
[0419] Turning now to the coupling member 73 that advances to attach to the input gear 68, as discussed<br>
above, when the process cartridge 20 is arranged in the main casing 2 and the front cover 7 is closed, the advancing<br>
portion 179 engages with the coupling member 73, as shown in FIG. 28(b). The coupling member 73 advances into<br>
the connecting hole 74 of the input gear 68 and couples with the input gear 68 so that the coupling member 73<br>
rotates integrally with the input gear 68. That is, the coupling member 73 is not rotatable with respect to the input<br>
gear 68.<br>
[0420] At the same time, the developer roller contacting member 175 advances to and contacts the<br>
developer roller electrode 76 by overlapping the developer roller electrode 76 along the width direction. As a result,<br>
a connection for providing a stable supply of electric power and a stable driving force to the developer cartridge 28<br>
is ensured.<br>
[0421] In this state, because the developer roller contacting member 175 contacts the developer roller<br>
electrode 76 by overlapping with the developer roller electrode 76 along the width direction and pressing<br>
against the developer roller electrode 76, the developer roller contacting member 175 helps prevent the left side<br>
wall 38 of the developer cartridge 28 from moving or rotating due to the driving force being applied to the input<br>
gear 68 via the coupling member 73.<br>
[0422] With regard to the collar member 83 and the bearing member 82 of the exemplary process<br>
cartridge 20, because the collar member 83 and the bearing member 82 are provided, for example, on both ends<br>
of the developer roller shaft 64 of the developer cartridge 28 and the respective collar member 83 is received by<br>
the corresponding shaft receiving portion 116 of the drum cartridge 27, when the driving force is transferred to<br>
the input gear 68 from the coupling member 73, movement or rotation of the developer cartridge casing 29 is<br>
regulated, and preferably prevented, by the drum cartridge casing 91.<br>
[0423] That is, in exemplary embodiments, the collar member 83 may be shaped and sized so as to<br>
extend, along the up and down directions, substantially across the respective roller shaft receiving portion 116<br>
su
drum cartridge casing 91 is regulated, and preferably prevented.<br>
[0424] The laser printer 1 which employs the process cartridge 20, the drum cartridge 27 and/or the<br>
developer cartridge 28 implementing one or more aspects of the invention may be reduced in size while the<br>
average length of time that the laser printer 1 reliably operates (not including image formation issues due to low<br>
or no toner in the developer cartridge 28) to form images using the process cartridge 20 is increased. While the<br>
electrode arrangement of the process cartridge 20 is advantageous for reducing, and preferably preventing, the<br>
damage to the electrodes 148, 132, 131, 127, 137 and 76, the electrode arrangement also helps reduce, and<br>
preferably prevent, damage to the electrode contacting portions 168, 169, 170, 171, 172 and 173 of the main<br>
casing 2.<br>
[0425] Thus, contact failure between the electrodes 148, 132, 131, 127, 137 and 76 and the<br>
corresponding connecting portions 168, 169, 170, 171, 172 and 173 and/or contacting portions 271, 272, 273,<br>
274, 275 and 276 is reduced. Thus, a stable supply of electric power necessary for stable image formation can<br>
be ensured, on average, for a longer period of time.<br>
[0426] Aside from adequate and stable power, the process cartridge 20 also relies on proper<br>
positioning in order to process high quality images. For example, when the process cartridge 20 is attached to<br>
the drum cartridge 27, and at least when the image formation process is initiated, the developer roller 32 must<br>
contact the photosensitive drum 92. As discussed above, in exemplary embodiments, as shown in FIGS. 21(a)-<br>
21(d), to attach the developer cartridge 28 to the drum cartridge 27, the developer cartridge boss 79 engages<br>
with the pressing member 151 of the pressing portion 149 of the drum cartridge 27.<br>
[0427] The developer cartridge boss 79 may be provided on the upper extension portion 37 of the<br>
developer cartridge 28 while the pressing portion 149 is provided on the lower extension portion 104 of the<br>
drum cartridge. When the developer cartridge boss 79 is pressed toward the pressing portion 149, the developer<br>
cartridge boss 79 contacts the pressing member 151 and by the backward urging force of the spring 152, when the<br>
developer cartridge boss 79 is "locked" into the pressing portion 149, the developer cartridge boss 79 and the<br>
developer cartridge 28 are urged back such that the exposed portion of the developer roller 32 of the developer<br>
cartridge 28 contacts the exposed portion of the photosensitive drum 92.<br>
[0428] Thus, in such embodiments, the pressing portion 149 helps ensure that there is adequate contact<br>
between the photosensitive drum 92 and the developer roller 32 when the developer cartridge 28 is attached to the<br>
drum cartridge 27. Thus, when such a process cartridge 20 is attached to the main casing 2, the process cartridge 20<br>
helps ensure that there is adequate contact between the photosensitive drum 92 and the developer roller 32 during<br>
image forming operations of the laser printer 1.<br>
[0429] hi exemplary embodiments, the developer cartridge boss 79 protrudes outward, along the width<br>
direction, from the back-bottom portion of at least one of the left side wall extension 52 and the right side wall<br>
extension 53. In embodiments where only one pressing portion 149 is provided, the developer cartridge boss 79<br>
on the same side as the pressing portion 149 may easily and accurately contact the pressing member 151 of the<br>
pressing portion 149. Thus, more accurate pressing of the developer roller 32 to the photosensitive drum 92 can be<br>
ensured.<br>
[0430] Furthermore, in exemplary embodiments of the process cartridge 20, when the developer<br>
cartridge 28 is attached to the drum cartridge 27, the contact portion 161 of the lock lever 153 provided at the lower<br>
extension portion 104 engages with the developer cartridge boss 79 of the upper extension portion 37, such that the<br>
developer cartridge boss 79 is prevented from moving upward. As a result, the developer cartridge 28 is "locked" to<br>
the drum cartridge 27 such that movement of the developer cartridge 28 relative to the drum cartridge 27 is<br>
regulated, and preferably prevented in order to maintain the contact between the developer roller 32 and the<br>
photosensitive drum 92.<br>
[0431] When the developer cartridge 28 is to be detached from the drum cartridge 27, in exemplary<br>
embodiments, the control member 158 is pressed downward to release the developer cartridge boss 79 from the<br>
contact portion 161 of the pressing portion 149. By providing the control member 158 within the overall boundary<br>
of the process cartridge 20, such as the space between the left side wall 38 of the developer cartridge casing 29 and<br>
the left side wall 96 of the drum cartridge casing 91, in exemplary embodiments, the lock lever 153 does not<br>
protrude from the outer boundary of the process cartridge 20.<br>
[0432] Thus, the lock lever 153, and in particular, the control member 158 is not prone to engaging with<br>
or rubbing against the main casing 2 during attachment and detachment of the process cartridge 20 to/from the main<br>
casing 2. In some embodiments, however, the control member 158 may project beyond the outer boundary of the<br>
process cartridge 20.<br>
[0433] In exemplary embodiments of the process cartridge 20, the developer cartridge boss 79 functions<br>
as both a pressed portion (operated portion) and an engaged portion. That is, the developer cartridge boss 79 is the<br>
portion of the developer cartridge 28 that is pressed or operated on by the pressing member 151 as well as the<br>
portion of the developer cartridge 28 that engages with the contact portion 161 of the pressing portion 149. Thus, hi<br>
exemplary embodiments, by having a member (i.e., the developer cartridge boss 79) that serves both as the pressed<br>
portion and the engaged portion, the structure of the process cartridge 20 is simplified and the number of parts of<br>
the developer cartridge 28 can be reduced. While the pressed portion and the engaged portion can be provided<br>
separately, the number of parts of the developer cartridge 28 may be increased.<br>
[0434] Another mechanism provided in exemplary embodiments of the process cartridge 20 to help<br>
ensure the contact between the photosensitive drum 92 and the developer roller 32 is the protruding portions 118 of<br>
the drum cartridge 27 which engage with the positioning members 84 of the developer cartridge 28. As shown in<br>
FIG. 3, although the protruding portions 118 and the positioning members 84 may have a simple structure, the<br>
protruding portions 118 and the positioning member 84 help easily and accurately position the developer cartridge<br>
28 relative to the drum cartridge 27. The protruding portions 118 and the positioning members 84 also help<br>
regulate the movement of the developer cartridge 28 relative to the drum cartridge 27 when the developer cartridge<br>
boss 79 is "locked" by the pressing portion 149.<br>
[0435] Further, with regard to positioning, as discussed above and as shown in FIG. 1, the laser printer 1<br>
may be provided with the positioning member 166 that engages with the drum cartridge boss 150 when the process<br>
cartridge 20 is attached to the main casing 2. hi exemplary embodiments, because the positioning member 166<br>
works with a relatively small member (e.g., drum cartridge boss 150) of the process cartridge 20, the positioning<br>
member 166 itself may also be small such that the positioning member 166 may help reduce the overall size of the<br>
laser printer 1, while helping to ensure that the process cartridge 20 is accurately positioned within the main casing<br>
2.<br>
[0436] The positioning member 166 also helps regulate movement of the process cartridge 20 during an<br>
image forming operation where rotation of the photosensitive drum 92 relative to the developer roller 32 may urge<br>
the front end of the process cartridge 20 downward while urging the back end of the process cartridge 20 upward so<br>
as to cause the process cartridge 20 to rotate about the lower front end of the process cartridge 20.<br>
[0437] The exemplary positioning member 166 is positioned below the front end of the process cartridge<br>
20 so as to serve as a stopper and to help prevent the front end of the process cartridge 20 from moving downward<br>
in response to the urging force resulting from the rotation of the photosensitive drum 92 and the developer roller 32.<br>
[0438] Referring again to the process cartridge 20, by providing the gear mechanism 45 and the lock<br>
lever 153 on a same side of the developer cartridge 28, the width of the developer cartridge 28 may be reduced.<br>
Further, by providing the pressing portion 149 on the lower extension portion 104 of the drum cartridge 27 and<br>
developer cartridge boss 79 on the upper extension portion 37 of the developer cartridge 28, the thickness (i.e.,<br>
distance in the up and down directions) and/or the overall size of the process cartridge 20 can be reduced.<br>
J [0439] By reducing the size of the process cartridge 20, the size of the laser printer 1 may also be<br>
reduced. For example, when the thickness of the process cartridge 20 is reduced, the thickness (i.e., distance in the<br>
up and down directions) of the attachment/detachment cavity 6 of the main casing 2 may also be reduced. More<br>
particularly, when the overall size (i.e., thickness, volume, length, and/or width) of the process cartridge 20 is<br>
reduced, the size of the attachment/detachment cavity 6 of the main casing 2 may also be reduced. As a result, the<br>
overall size of the laser printer 1 may also be reduced.<br>
[0440] Referring now to the drum cartridge 27 of the process cartridge 20, as shown in FIG. 15, the<br>
upper resist roller 14 and the front bottom ribs 165 may be provided on the bottom surface of the bottom extension<br>
wall portion 195 of the lower extension portion 104. The bottom ribs 162 may provided on the bottom surface of<br>
the front bottom wall portion 194 of the developer cartridge housing portion 103. In exemplary embodiments,<br>
when the developer cartridge 28 is attached to the drum cartridge 27, the front bottom ribs 165 are in front of the<br>
upper resist roller 14 while the bottom ribs 162 are behind the upper resist roller 14 such that the sheet 3 supplied<br>
from the sheet supply roller 10 is guided by the front bottom ribs 165 to the upper and lower resist rollers 14 and<br>
thereafter guided to the photosensitive drum 92 by the bottom ribs 162.<br>
[0441] More particularly, in exemplary embodiments, the combination of the bottom ribs 162 on the<br>
bottom wall 98 of the drum cartridge 27 and the front bottom ribs 165 on the bottom extension wall portion 195 of<br>
the drum cartridge 27 help strengthen the bottom wall 98 and the bottom extension wall portion 195, respectively,<br>
while forming a substantially continuous guiding mechanism for guiding the sheet 3 to the upper and lower resist<br>
roller 14 and further to the photosensitive drum 92 along the bottom extension wall portion 195 and the bottom wall<br>
 [0442] Aside from features included in the process cartridge 20 to help improve the image formation<br>
process and/or to help reduce the size of the process cartridge 20, the process cartridge 20 may also be provided<br>
with features for helping a user handle the process cartridge 20, the drum cartridge 27 and/or the developer cartridge<br>
28 during attachment/detachment thereof to the main casing 2 or each other, respectively.<br>
[0443] As discussed above and as shown in FIG. 5, the developer cartridge 28 may be provided with the<br>
handle 81 on the front side of the developer cartridge 28. In exemplary embodiments, the gripping portion 78 is<br>
provided in front of the developer housing section 30 rather than above or below the developer housing section 30.<br>
Thus, the overall thickness (i.e., distance in the up and down directions) of the developer cartridge 28 is not<br>
increased by the gripping portion 78. Further, when the process cartridge 20 is attached to the main casing 2, the<br>
gripping portion 78 is easier to reach and grip onto.<br>
[0444] More particularly, as discussed above, as the overall size of image forming devices such as the<br>
laser printer 1 is being reduced, the image formation process requires that the members of the process cartridge 20<br>
generally be located deeper within the main casing 2. Thus, generally, the closer the gripping portion 78 is provided<br>
to the opening of the maing casing 2 through which the process cartridge 20 is attached and detached, the easier it<br>
will be for a user to attach/detach the process cartridge 20. In some embodiments, however, the gripping portion 78<br>
may be provided above the developer housing section 30.<br>
[0445J Further, by providing the gripping portion 78 on the upper extension portion 37 that may be<br>
integrally connected to the lower frame 34 of the developer cartridge housing 29, the developer cartridge 28 may be<br>
stably handled via the gripping portion 78 without requiring additional connecting parts for securing the connection<br>
between the upper extension portion 37 and the developer housing section 30. In some embodiments, however, the<br>
upper extension portion 37 may be connected to the developer housing section 30 by way of the connecting parts.<br>
[0446] When the developer cartridge 28 is attached to the drum cartridge 27 so as to form the process<br>
cartridge 20, the gripping portion 78 may be used to simultaneously remove/attach/handle/grip the drum cartridge<br>
27 and developer cartridge 28 (i.e., the process cartridge 20). Thus, in some embodiments, the drum cartridge 27<br>
does not include its own handle. In other embodiments, the drum cartridge 27 may be provided with its own<br>
handle.<br>
« [0447] In exemplary embodiments of the developer cartridge 28 of the process cartridge 20, as shown in<br>
FIG. 5, the upper wall extension 50 of the upper extension portion 37 that extends along the length direction and the<br>
upper front side wall 42 of the upper extension portion 37 that extends substantially along the upward and<br>
downward directions have substantially flat outer surfaces. As the process cartridge 20 is reduced in size, when the<br>
process cartridge 20 is detached from the main casing 2, by providing substantially flat surfaces, a user can more<br>
easily handle the process cartridge 20 by grasping onto the flat outer surfaces of the process cartridge 20.<br>
[0448] hi addition, in the exemplary embodiment illustrated in FIG. 13, the combination of the notch 80<br>
of the upper extension portion 37 and the notch 119 of the lower extension portion 104 define an open space around<br>
the handle 81 such that a user can more easily grasp the handle 81. Therefore, the handle 81 provided at<br>
substantially the middle of the developer cartridge 28, along the width direction and at substantially the middle of<br>
the upper extension portion 37, along the thickness direction (i.e., the up and down direction) may be securely and<br>
easily gripped.<br>
[0449] hi the exemplary embodiment shown in FIG. 5, the handle 81 is a rod-like member that extends,<br>
along the width direction, between facing portions of the upper front side wall 42 in the notch 80. In some<br>
embodiments, the handle 81 may be a member that projects from one or both portions of the upper front side<br>
wall 42 that extend along the length direction to form side walls of the notch 80, while in some embodiments<br>
the handle 81 may continuously extend from the inner portion of the upper front side wall 42 that extends along<br>
the width direction and forms the backwall of the notch 80. While the handle 81 may be implemented in various<br>
shapes, in exemplary embodiments, as shown in FIG. 3, the handle 81 has a U-like or concave shape in crosssection<br>
such that a user can securely and easily grasp onto the front arm of the U-like handle 81.<br>
[0450] As shown in FIGS. 13 and 19, the lower side front wall 99 of the drum cartridge 27 extends along<br>
the up and down directions as does the upper front side wall 42 of the developer cartridge 28. Thus when the<br>
developer cartridge 28 is attached to the drum cartridge 27 the process cartridge 20 has a substantially flat front<br>
outer surface 61, with the exception of the notch 80 of the upper extension portion 37 and the notch 119 of the<br>
lower extension portion 104. Thus, as discussed above, a user may easily and comfortably handle the process<br>
cartridge 20 by wrapping his/her hands around the front of the process cartridge 20 without risking being poked or<br>
hurt by projecting portions of the process cartridge 20 and/or damage to and/or contamination of components of the<br>
process cartridge 20.<br>
[0451] Furthermore, in exemplary embodiments, the notch 119 of the lower extension portion <br>
substantially overlaps with the notch 80 of the upper extension portion 37. Thus, when the developer cartridge 28 is<br>
attached to the drum cartridge 27, the combination of the notches 80, 119 provide a larger amount of space for a<br>
user to grasp the handle 81 during attachment/detachment of the process cartridge 20 to/from the main casing 2.<br>
More particularly, in the exemplary embodiment of the process cartridge 20 shown in FIG. 13, the combination of<br>
the notches 18,119 form a substantially rectangular shape when viewed from the front of the process cartridge 20.<br>
[0452] hi exemplary embodiments, the protruding members 51 of the upper extension portion 37 are<br>
received by the receiving portions 120 of the lower extension portion 104 when the developer cartridge 28 is<br>
attached to the drum cartridge 27. The protruding members 51 and/or the receiving portions 120 also help<br>
reduce the chance of an incorrect developer cartridge 28 being attached to the drum cartridge 27 and/or the<br>
developer cartridge 28 being attached to an incorrect drum cartridge 27.<br>
[0453] As a result of the upper front side wall 42 being substantially flat, the developer cartridge 28 has a<br>
substantially flat front outer surface 61, as discussed above. Thus, as shown in FIG. 30, the developer cartridge 28<br>
may be situated front side down on a surface 197. Further, while the upper front side wall 42 may itself be<br>
sufficient to allow the developer cartridge 28 to be situated front side down on the surface 197, the protruding<br>
members 51, which extend substantially across the remaining distance along the thickness (i.e., along the up and<br>
down directions) of the developer cartridge 28, from the lower edge of the upper front side wall 42, allow the<br>
developer cartridge 28 to be more stably arranged front side down on the surface 197.<br>
[0454] By allowing the developer cartridge 28 to be situated front side down on a surface 197, the<br>
developer cartridge 28 can be stored, for example, vertically such that damage to the developer roller 32 that may<br>
result from the developer roller 32 contacting the surface 197 on which of the developer cartridge 28 is placed, is<br>
prevented.<br>
[0455] As discussed above, in exemplary embodiments, each of the drum cartridge 27 and the process<br>
cartridge 20 also have a substantially flat front outer surface. By providing each of the drum cartridge 27 and the<br>
process cartridge 20 with the substantially flat front outer surface when the drum cartridge 27 and/or the process<br>
cartridge 20 is removed from the main casing 2, the process cartridge 20 may be situated front side down similar to<br>
the developer cartridge 28 shown in FIG. 30.<br>
[0456] By storing, for example, the drum cartridge 27 and/or the process cartridge 20 front side down on<br>
the surface 197, damage to the photosensitive drum 92, while the process cartridge 20 is outside of the main casing<br>
2, can be reduced, and preferably prevented. During assembly, for example, by situating the developer cartridge 28,<br>
the drum cartridge 27 and/or process cartridge 20 front side down, parts, such as a tunnel seal (not shown), can be<br>
easily assembled.<br>
[0457] In addition, in exemplary embodiments of the developer cartridge 28, the receiving portion 352<br>
helps reduce, and preferably prevent, the attachment of the developer cartridge 28 to an improper image forming<br>
device (e.g., an image forming device different from the laser printer 1). By providing the receiving portions 352 in<br>
the form of grooves or indentations, rather than as projecting portions, the overall size of the developer cartridge 28<br>
is not increased by the inclusion of the receiving portions 352. Also, by providing the receiving portions 352 in the<br>
upper extension portion 37 instead of, for example, along the front portion 44 of the lower wall 40, the volume of<br>
the developer housing section 30 (the amount of toner contained in the developer housing section 30) is not<br>
reduced.<br>
[0458] Further, in the exemplary embodiment, the receiving portion 352 is in the form of an indentation<br>
or notch formed along the upper comer of the upper extension portion 37 such that the receiving portion 352<br>
continuously extends from the upper extension wall portion 50 to the front side upper wall 42. Thus, the protruding<br>
portions 351 provided, for example, on the front cover 7 can more easily fit into the receiving portions 352 when<br>
the process cartridge 20 is attached to the main casing 2 and the front cover 7 is closed by rotating the front cover<br>
about its lower end.<br>
[0459] FIG. 31 is a cross-sectional view, along the length direction, of another exemplary<br>
embodiment of a process cartridge 720 including another exemplary embodiment of a developer cartridge 728,<br>
and another exemplary embodiment of a drum cartridge 727. The process cartridge 720 shown in FIG. 31 is<br>
formed by attaching the developer cartridge 728 to the drum cartridge 727 and like the embodiment described<br>
above, the process cartridge 720 may be attached to and detached from the main casing 2. FIGS. 31-41 illustrate<br>
some exemplary variations to the exemplary process cartridge 720, the exemplary drum cartridge 727 and/or the<br>
exemplary developer cartridge 728 described above in relation to FIGS. 1-30. Thus, in the following<br>
description of the exemplary embodiment shown in FIGS. 31-41, elements similar or identical to elements in the<br>
exemplary embodiment shown in FIGS. 1-30 are designated by the same reference numerals, and the<br>
description thereof may be omitted for the sake of brevity.<br>
[0460] FIG. 32 is a top-front-left-side perspective view of the developer cartridge 728 shown in FIG. 31;<br>
FIG. 33 is a front-bottom-right side perspective view of the developer cartridge 728; and FIG. 34 is a top-back-leftside<br>
perspective view of the developer cartridge 728 shown in FIG. 31.<br>
[0461] The developer cartridge 728 may include, for example, the developer cartridge casing 729, the<br>
developer supply roller 31, the developer roller 32, the agitator 46, and the thickness <br>
developer cartridge casing 729 rotatably supports the developer supply roller 31, the developer roller 32 and the<br>
agitator 46.<br>
0462] The developer cartridge casing 729 may be formed, for example, of a resin material, such as<br>
polyethylene, and may have a generally rectangular-like shape with an open back side. The developer cartridge<br>
casing 729 may include the lower frame 34 and the upper frame 35. As shown in FIGS. 32 and 33, the lower frame<br>
34 may integrally include, for example, a left side wall 38 and a right side wall 39 positioned facing each other with<br>
a space between them along the width direction, a lower wall 40 and an upper wall 41 connecting the left side wall<br>
38 and the right side wall 39, and an upper front side wall 42, provided, for example, at the front edge of the upper<br>
wall 41. A back end portion 88 (see FIG. 4) of the upper wall 41 corresponds to the upper one of the back ends 87<br>
of the developer supplying section 36.<br>
[0463] As shown in FIG. 33, in some embodiments, the developer cartridge 728 may include a plurality<br>
of ribs 311 for guiding the sheet 3 on the outer-bottom surface of the back portion 43. The ribs 311 may extend<br>
substantially parallel to each other along the length direction leaving spaces between the ribs 311. Each of the ribs<br>
311 may be formed so as to have a step-like or wave-like shape, when viewed from the left or right side of the<br>
developer cartridge 728 and such that the bottom edge of the back portion of the rib 311 is farther from the axis of<br>
rotation of the developer roller 32 than the bottom edge of the front portion of the rib 311. The ribs 311 are<br>
configured to face the paper guiding ribs 194C, when the developer cartridge 728 is attached to the drum cartridge<br>
727. During operation, the sheet 3 is guided between the ribs 311 and the paper guiding ribs 194C. A portion of<br>
the ribs 311 that contacts the sheet 3 and faces the paper guiding ribs 194C is substantially horizontal in the length<br>
direction.<br>
[0464] FIGS. 32 and 33 illustrate another exemplary embodiment of a gripping portion 201 for<br>
gripping and handling the developer cartridge 728 that may be used in some embodiments of the developer<br>
cartridge 728 and/or process cartridge 720. Like the gripping portion 78 shown in FIG. 13, the gripping portion<br>
201 may be provided in the upper extension portion 37 of the developer cartridge casing 729. The gripping<br>
portion 201 includes, for example, a notch 202, and a handle 203 provided in the notch 202.<br>
[0465] The notch 202 may be formed, for example, at substantially the center, along the width<br>
direction, of the upper wall extension 50. In exemplary embodiments, the notch 202 is formed as a result of a<br>
substantially rectangular shaped cut-out portion, along the width direction, of the front portion of the upper wall<br>
extension 50 and the upper portion of the upper front side wall 42. The cut-out portions of the upper wall<br>
extension 50 and the upper front side wall 42 may be continuously formed, as shown in FIGS. 32 and 33 such<br>
that the handle 203 may be easily accessed by a user.<br>
[0466] The notch 202 is defined by two side wall portions 204 and a back wall portion 207 of the<br>
upper front side wall 42. The side wall portions 204 face each other and extend, along the length direction,<br>
substantially perpendicularly to both the upper front side wall 42 and the upper wall extension 50 and the back<br>
wall portion 207 extends, along the width direction, substantially parallel to the upper front side wall 42.<br>
[0467] The handle 203 extends between the two side wall portions 204. The handle 203 may have a<br>
first wall portion 205 and a second wall portion 206 both of which extend, along the width direction, between<br>
the two side wall portions 204. A back end portion of the second wall portion 206 extends continuously from<br>
the back wall portion 207 of the upper front side wall 42. A back end portion of the first wall portion 205<br>
extends continuously from a front end portion of the second wall portion 206.<br>
[0468] In some embodiments, the second wall portion 206 may be a plate like member that extends<br>
substantially horizontally along the width and length directions while the first wall portion 205 may be a plate<br>
like member that extends upward from the second wall portion 206 such that the first wall portion 205 and the<br>
second wall portion 206 form an angle. In such embodiments, the combination of the back wall portion 207, the<br>
first wall portion 205 and the second wall portion 206 may form a U-like shape.<br>
[0469] In some embodiments, such as, for example, the exemplary embodiment illustrated in FIGS.<br>
32 and 33, a finger gripping portion 208 may be provided at a substantial middle of the handle 203. In the<br>
finger gripping portion 208, the second wall portion 206 may project upward along an incline so as to connect a<br>
substantially middle portion of the back wall portion 207 with a substantially middle and top edge of the first<br>
wall portion 205. The finger gripping portion 208 may be a substantially semi-circular or rectangular cutout<br>
formed along a front end portion of the first wall portion 205.<br>
[0470] FIGS. 35-39 illustrate different views of the exemplary drum cartridge 727 illustrated in FIG.<br>
31. In exemplary embodiments, the transfer electrode opening 142 is a continuous opening formed by a cutout<br>
section in each of the second wall 109L and the third wall 110L of the left side wall 96 of the drum cartridge<br>
casing 791. The transfer electrode opening 142 has an inverse substantially L-like shape in cross section along<br>
the width direction, as shown in FIG. 41. In exemplary embodiments, the transfer electrode 737 has a shape<br>
corresponding to the shape of the transfer electrode opening 142. Thus, in exemplary embodiments, the transfer<br>
electrode 737 has a substantially L-like shape in cross section along the width direction.<br>
[0471] The transfer electrode 737 may be formed of a conductive resin material. As shown in<br>
FIG. 37, the transfer electrode 737 may include an electrode contacting portion 252 that protrudes outward,<br>
along the width direction and an engaging portion 251 that extends further outward, along the width direction,<br>
from the top end portion of the electrode contacting portion 252 so as to form a substantially cross-sectional Llike<br>
shape. A contact member (not shown) may be provided on the inner side of the drum cartridge casing 791<br>
(i.e., to the right of the left side wall 96). The contact member may contact the engaging portion 251 of the<br>
transfer electrode 737 from above, when the transfer electrode 737 is attached to the drum cartridge casing 791.<br>
When the contact member contacts the engaging portion 251, the transfer electrode 737 is prevented from<br>
moving or sliding out from the top of the transfer electrode receiving portion 143 during operation of the laser<br>
printer 1.<br>
[0472] In exemplary embodiments, a blocking member 209 may be provided, for example, behind the<br>
transfer electrode opening 142 on the outer surface of the second wall 109L as shown in FIGS. 37 and 38. The<br>
blocking member 209 may extend substantially in the up and down direction substantially adjacent to the back<br>
border of the transfer electrode opening 142 on the outer surface of the second wall 109L. As a result of the<br>
blocking member 209, when the drum cartridge 727 and/or the process cartridge 720 is attached to the main<br>
casing 2, the blocking member 209 helps prevent a transfer electrode connecting portion 272, described below,<br>
from entering a gap between the transfer electrode holding portion 138 and the transfer electrode 737.<br>
Therefore, the transfer electrode connecting portion 272 and the transfer electrode 737 can be accurately<br>
connected.<br>
[0473] Furthermore, as shown in FIGS. 35, 38 and 39, in some embodiments, a left engaging member<br>
210 and a right engaging member 214 are formed on the left and right ends of the upper back side wall 100.<br>
The left engaging member 210 is provided, for example, in front of the fifth wall 112 while, for example, the<br>
right engaging member 214 integrally extends from the upper back side wall 100. The left engaging member<br>
210 and the right engaging member 214 may be, for example, downward facing groove-like members that pinch<br>
the top portion of the projecting wall 117 of the left side wall 96 and right side wall 97, respectively.<br>
[0474] The left engaging member 210 integrally includes, for example, a top plate 211, a left side<br>
plate 212 and a right side plate 213. The left side plate 212 faces the right side plate 213 and both extend<br>
substantially along the length direction. The left side plate 212 and the right side plate 213 are substantially<br>
parallel to each other and are connected at top ends thereof by the top plate 211. The top plate 211 connects the<br>
left side plate 212 and the right side plate 213 together and extends outward, for example, from a lower-frontend<br>
portion of the fourth wall 111. Thus, the combination of the left side plate 212, the right side plate 213 and<br>
the top plate 211 forms an upside down groove capable of receiving the projecting wall 117.<br>
[0475] The right engaging member 214, for example, integrally includes a top plate 215 that has, for<br>
example, that has a substantially rectangular shape and extends toward the front and connects the upper ends of<br>
a left side plate 216 and a right side plate 217. The left side plate 216 and the right side plate 217 are, for<br>
example, plate-like members that extend downward from the left and right ends of the top plate 215 so as to<br>
form a downward facing groove capable of receiving the projecting wall 117.<br>
[0476] As shown in FIG. 37, in some embodiments, a paper exit opening 222 having, for example, a<br>
substantially rectangular shape may be provided between the top-back end of the back bottom wall portion 193<br>
and the back end of the upper back side wall 100. After the sheet 3 passed between the photosensitive drum 92<br>
and the transfer roller 94 and the image is transferred to the sheet 3, the sheet 3 is ejected through the paper exit<br>
opening 222. The paper exit opening 222 may, for example, be formed wider than the width of the sheet 3 so<br>
that the sheet 3 in the letter or A4 size, for example, can pass through.<br>
[0477] In addition, on the back bottom wall portion 193, in some embodiments, as shown in FIG. 37,<br>
for example, a brush support plate 223 that extends from the top end of the paper exit opening 222 towards the<br>
back of the photosensitive drum 92 may be provided. The brush support plate 223 may be arranged such that<br>
the back end thereof is at a slightly higher level along the thickness direction than the front end thereof. As<br>
shown in FIG. 31, the brush supporting member 123 for supporting the cleaning brush 95 may be provided, for<br>
example, along the width direction, on the front end of the brush support plate 223.<br>
[0478] Moreover, on the outer surface of the brush support plate 223, a plurality (e.g., 4) of contact<br>
preventing ribs 224 may be formed with spaces between them, along the width direction. The contact<br>
preventing ribs 224 may extend along the length direction. Furthermore, on the both ends of the outer surface of<br>
the brush support plate 223, a contact preventing portion 225 having, for example, a substantially triangular<br>
shape when viewing the lower or outer surface of the brush support plate 223, as shown in FIG. 37, may be<br>
provided.<br>
[0479] The contact preventing portions 225 may be formed by downward bent back corners of the<br>
brush support plate 223, as shown in FIG. 37. The contact preventing portions 225 reduce the width of the<br>
upper portion of the paper exit opening 222 so as to help prevent the sheet 3 exiting from the paper exit opening<br>
222 from contacting the contact preventing ribs 224 and, more particularly, the lower or outer surface of the<br>
brush support plate 223. Thus, right and left edges of the sheet 3 exiting from the paper exit opening 222 may<br>
be guided and urged away from the lower surface of the brush support plate 223 by the contact preventing<br>
portions 225.<br>
[0480] Therefore, the middle portion of the sheet 3, along the width direction, may be prevented from<br>
being lifted to the side of the brush support plate 223. Thus, the brush support plate 223 and the contact<br>
preventing ribs 224 help reduce and preferably prevent the toner image transferred to the sheet 3 from<br>
contacting the brush support plate 223. As a result, contamination of the bottom surface of the brush support<br>
plate 223 by the toner may be reduced, and preferably prevented, and the quality of the toner image transferred<br>
to the sheet 3 may be maintained.<br>
[0481] More particularly, as shown in FIG. 37, in some embodiments, the contact preventing ribs 224<br>
may be provided on the lower surface of the brush support plate 223. The contact preventing ribs 224 may<br>
extend from the top end of the paper exit opening 222 toward the back side of the photosensitive drum 92. The<br>
contact preventing ribs 224 help reduce, and preferably prevent, the sheet 3, onto which the toner image has<br>
been transferred, from contacting the lower surface of the brush support plate 223. That is, in the event that the<br>
sheet 3 approaches the brush support plate 223 while exiting through the paper exit opening 222, the sheet 3 will<br>
contact the contact preventing ribs 224, which project from the lower surface of the brush support plate 223<br>
instead of contacting the lower surface of the brush support plate 223.<br>
[0482] Therefore, the lower surface of the brush support plate 223 is prevented from becoming dirty<br>
by toner that can later transfer to another portion of the exiting sheet 3 or a following sheet 3 and that can<br>
degrade the quality of the toner image transferred thereon. Thus, the contact preventing ribs 224 help reduce,<br>
and preferably prevent, contamination of the brush support plate 223 such that the sheet 3 exiting from the paper<br>
exit evening 222 does not get contaminated and the quality of the toner image transferred to the sheet 3 can be<br>
maintained.<br>
[0483] In substantially a center of the lower surface of the brush support plate 223, a substantially<br>
rectangular film member 226 may be provided as shown in FIG. 37. The film member 226 may be, for<br>
example, slightly wider than the width of the pickup roller 12 along the width direction. The film member 226<br>
may be formed of a resin material, such as polyethylene terephthalate. The film member 226 may be positioned<br>
so as to slightly project from the front end of the brush support plate 223 toward the front (e.g., toward the<br>
photosensitive drum 92).<br>
[0484] The film member 226 may be adhered to substantially the center portion of the lower surface<br>
of the brush support plate 223 by, for example, a double-sided adhesive tape. The double-sided adhesive tape<br>
may be provided to the front end of the film member 226 (and positioned adjacent to the photosensitive drum<br>
92). That is, the double-sided adhesive tape may also be provided at the portion of the film member 226 that<br>
projects, for example, forward from the end of the brush support plate 223.<br>
[0485] By positioning the film member 226 at substantially the center portion of the lower surface of<br>
the brush support plate 223 so as to slightly project beyond the front edge of the brush support plate 223 towards<br>
the front side of the drum cartridge 727 (i.e., towards the photosensitive drum 92), the paper dust removed from<br>
the surface of the photosensitive drum 92 by the cleaning brush 95 can be received by the film member 226. In<br>
addition, by also providing the double-sided adhesive tape at a part of the film member 226 projecting from the<br>
front end of the brush support plate 223, the paper dust received form the cleaning brush 95 adheres to the<br>
adhesive surface of the double-sided adhesive tape, and thus the paper dust is prevented from flying off the film<br>
member 226.<br>
[0486] In some embodiments, as shown in FIG. 35, a drum cartridge handle 234 may be provided.<br>
The drum cartridge handle 234 may, for example, be provided in the lower extension portion 104. The drum<br>
cartridge handle 234 may include, for example, a notch 235 and a drum cartridge grip 236. The drum cartridge<br>
grip 236 may, be formed by a substantially upward table-like or inverse U-like projecting portion of the bottom<br>
extension wall portion 195 of the lower extension portion 104. The drum cartridge grip 236 may be gripped, for<br>
example, to remove/attach/handle the drum cartridge 727 and/or the process cartridge 720 when the developer<br>
cartridge 728 is attached to the drum cartridge 727.<br>
[0487] More particularly, the notch 235 may be formed at substantially the central portion of the<br>
lower side extension portion 104 along the width direction. The bottom extension wall portion 195 and the<br>
lower front side wall 99 may be continuously cut out so that the front end portion of the bottom wall extension<br>
portion 195 is cut out in, for example, a substantially rectangular shape along the width direction in the plan<br>
view. The notch 235 may be formed to have a width slightly smaller than the notch 202 formed on the upper<br>
wall extension 50 of the developer cartridge 728.<br>
[0488] The drum cartridge grip 236 may integrally include a pair of side support members 237<br>
extending upward substantially perpendicular from the left and right sides of the notch 235. The drum cartridge<br>
grip 236 may further include a back support member 238 that extends at a slight incline from the front bottom<br>
wall portion 194 towards the upper back end portion of the drum cartridge grip 236. The drum cartridge grip<br>
236 may further include a top surface portion 239 having, for example, substantially rectangular shape in plan<br>
provided between the top ends of the side support members 237 and the back support member 238.<br>
[0489] Further, as shown in FIG. 36, an opening 240 may be formed on the back support member<br>
238. The opening 240 may have a rectangular like shape, when viewed from the front. The opening 240<br>
exposes the lower extension portion 104 to the developer cartridge housing portion 103 of the drum cartridge<br>
727. Thus, when gripping the top surface portion 239 and the handle 203 together, fingers can be inserted,<br>
through the opening 240, such that the fingers may contact the front portion 44 of the lower wall 40 of the<br>
developer cartridge 728 when the developer cartridge 728 is attached to the developer cartridge housing portion<br>
103. /A.s a result, attachment and detachment of the process cartridge 720 with respect to the main casing 2 can<br>
be im&gt;re accurately achieved.<br>
N [0490] In addition, in such embodiments, to detach the developer cartridge 728 from the drum<br>
cartridge 727, it is possible for a user to only grip the handle 203 via the finger gripping portion 208 that<br>
overlaps a cutout portion 241 of in the top surface portion 239.<br>
[0491] Furthermore, as shown in FIG. 37, the drum cartridge grip 236 may fit within the notch 202 of<br>
the developer cartridge 728 when the developer cartridge 728 is attached to the drum cartridge 727. The top<br>
surface portion 239 may be shaped and/or sized so as to be slightly smaller than the notch 202, along the width<br>
direction such that when the developer cartridge 728 is attached to the drum cartridge 727, the top surface 239<br>
extends substantially between the pair of side wall portions 204 of the developer cartridge 728.<br>
[0492] On the top surface portion 239, a step 261 may be formed so that the substantially back half<br>
portion of the top surface portion 239 is relatively higher than the substantially front half portion of the top<br>
surface portion 239. Further, because the step 261 is formed on the top surface portion 239 such that the<br>
substantially back half portion becomes relatively high, and that the substantially front half portion becomes<br>
relatively low, the fingers can be hooked to the step 261 when gripping the top surface portion 239 and the<br>
handle 203 together. As a result, holding the top surface portion 239 and the handle 203 becomes easier, and<br>
integral attachment and detachment of the drum cartridge 727 and the developer cartridge 728 with respect to<br>
the main casing 2 can be performed more accurately.<br>
[0493] As shown in FIG. 35, the cutout portion 241 may be formed at the top surface portion 239 at a<br>
part overlapping the finger gripping portion 208 of the handle 203 of the developer cartridge 728. The cutout<br>
portion 241 may, for example, have a substantially semicircular shape extending along the length and width<br>
directions. In some embodiments, when the developer cartridge 728 is attached to the drum cartridge 727 a very<br>
small gap exists between the top surface portion 239 and the handle 203. hi some embodiments, when the<br>
developer cartridge 728 is attached to the drum cartridge 727, the top surface portion 239 and the handle 203 are<br>
in contact with each other.<br>
[0494] As a result, as shown in FIGS. 37 and 41, when the developer cartridge 728 is attached to the<br>
drum cartridge 727, the handle 203 and the drum cartridge grip 236 can be gripped together with the finger<br>
gripping portion 208 of the handle 203. Because, for example, the top surface portion 239 of the drum cartridge<br>
grip 236 is positioned to overlap with the handle 203 provided on the upper extension portion 37 of the<br>
developer cartridge 728, the top surface portion 239 and the handle 203 can be easily gripped together. As a<br>
result, the drum cartridge 727 and the developer cartridge 728 can be easily gripped together and integrally<br>
attached to and/or detached from the main casing 2.<br>
[0495] That is, the developer cartridge 728 is prevented from separating from the drum cartridge 727<br>
when attaching and/or detaching the drum cartridge 727 and the developer cartridge 728 to the main casing 2<br>
while the drum cartridge 727 and the developer cartridge 728 are in an attached state. More particularly, when<br>
the developer cartridge 728 is attached to the drum cartridge 727 and the drum cartridge grip 236 is gripped, the<br>
top surface portion 239 supports the handle 203 thereon such that both the drum cartridge 727 and the developer<br>
cartridge 728 can be easily handled in the attached state.<br>
[0496] Referring now to the bottom extension wall portion 195, as shown in FIG. 36, the front bottom<br>
ribs 165 may be provided on the outer-bottom surface of the bottom extension wall portion 195 of the bottom wall<br>
98 along the width direction including the bottom side of the notch 235 formed in the lower front side wall 99.<br>
As discussed above, the front bottom ribs 165 may be formed separately from the drum cartridge casing 791 and<br>
with a resin material, such as a polyacetal resin, that is harder than the material of the developer cartridge casing<br>
729 and the drum cartridge casing 791.<br>
[0497] Thus, if the front bottom ribs 165 become worn as a result of contact with sheet 3, the front<br>
bottom ribs 165 can be replaced without having to replace the entire drum cartridge 727 and/or the process<br>
cartridge 20. More particularly, in the exemplary embodiment illustrated in FIG. 36, for example, the plurality<br>
of tbje front bottom ribs 165 are positioned with spaces between them along the width direction and so as to<br>
exteno along the length direction. The front bottom ribs 165 may be attached to the lower surface of the bottom<br>
extension wall portion 195 by, for example, being connected to a connecting member 227 extending along the<br>
width direction.<br>
[0498] Thus, on the lower surface of the bottom extension wall portion 195 of the bottom wall 98 of<br>
the drum cartridge 727, the front bottom ribs 165 may be attached as part of the connecting member 227<br>
positioned so as to extend along the width direction at least so as to cover the space between the lower ends of<br>
the side support members 237. As a result, the strength (rigidity) of the side supporting members 237 and the<br>
drum cartridge grip 236 can be increased by integrally forming the side supporting members 237 and the drum<br>
cartridge grip 236 from the bottom extension wall portion of the bottom wall 98, while the front bottom ribs 165<br>
may be made from a stronger material than the material used to form the drum cartridge casing 791.<br>
[0499] Thus, in some embodiments, the connecting members 227 may be formed of a material that is<br>
stronger than the material from which the drum cartridge casing 791 is made. In some embodiments, the bottom<br>
extension wall portion 195 of the bottom wall 98 may continuously extend substantially between the left and<br>
right sides of the lower extension portion 104 and integrally include a projecting portion for the drum cartridge<br>
handle 234.<br>
[0500] As there is a constant need and desire for smaller, lighter and more portable image forming<br>
devices, another aspect of the invention is to provide a compact attachable/detachable drum cartridge, a compact<br>
attachable/detachable developer cartridge and a compact attachable/detachable process cartridge which each<br>
have the features necessary for them to carry out their function while being compact such that the internal space<br>
of the image forming device may be used efficiently. According to another aspect of the invention, as described<br>
below, approximate sizes of various exemplary components and features of a drum cartridge 727, a developer<br>
cartridge 728 and a process cartridge 720 implementing one or more aspects of the invention, will be provided<br>
below in connection with FIGS. 42-53. The exemplary sizes of the various components allow for efficient use<br>
of the internal space of an image forming device employing the attachable/detachable drum cartridge 727,<br>
developer cartridge 728 and/or process cartridge 720 according to one or more aspects of the invention.<br>
[0501] FIGS. 42-47 are, respectively, a plan view, a back view, a front view, a left side view, a<br>
bottom view, and a cross sectional view along line A-A of FIG. 31, including reference bars, of an exemplary<br>
embodiment of the drum cartridge 727.<br>
[0502] The detailed relationship of the measurement of various parts of the exemplary drum cartridge<br>
727 shown in FIG. 31 are described with reference to FIGS. 42-47 and Tables 1-4 provided below. In addition,<br>
although reference numerals are not assigned to the parts in FIGS. 42-47, the reference numerals are used in<br>
Tables 1-4 o clarify the relationships between the parts shown in FIGS. 42-47 and discussed above with respect<br>
to the previous drawings.<br>
[0503] The unit of measure in Tables 1-8, below, is millimeters (mm), with the exception of angles.<br>
All the values provided are intended to include the exact value and substantially the exact value. For example, the<br>
value for Dl in Table 1 is provided as 7.6. Thus, the distance Dl between the outermost portion of the ground<br>
electrode 127 and the left side wall 96 of the drum cartridge casing 791 in an implementation of the exemplary<br>
embodiment may be exactly 7.6 mm or about 7.6 mm. hi the following Tables, many measurements are<br>
determined with a position of the drum shaft 125 (i.e., ground electrode 127) as a reference position because<br>
imperfect contacts between the ground electrode 127 and the ground electrode contacting portion 276 may occur if<br>
the position of the drum shaft 125 in the main casing 2 is offset from the reference position, hi the exemplary<br>
embodiments, the outermost portion of the ground electrode 127 corresponds to the outermost portion 125 A of the<br>
drum shaft 125 and the end portion 125B of the drum shaft 125 corresponds to a portion of the drum shaft 125 that<br>
extends beyond the left side wall 96.<br>

[0515] In exemplary embodiments, the external thickness (T20 + T23) of the developer supplying<br>
section 36 of the developer cartridge casing 729 (the position at which the developer supplying section 36 is<br>
formed in the developer cartridge casing 729) is smaller than the external thickness (T21 + T22) of the<br>
developer housing section 30 (the position at which the developer housing section 30 is formed in the developer<br>
cartridge casing 729). When the developer cartridge 728 is attached to the main casing 2, the side on which the<br>
developer supplying section 36 is arranged is positioned deeper into the main casing 2.<br>
[0516] In such embodiments, the attachment and detachment of the developer cartridge 728 with<br>
respect to the main casing 2 can be performed smoothly because, for example, the external thickness (T20 +<br>
T23) of the developer supplying section 36 of the developer cartridge casing 729 is smaller than the external<br>
thickness (T21 + T22) at the position of the developer housing section 30. In some embodiments, the external<br>
thickness (T21 + T22) of the developer housing section 30 may be substantially the same as the external<br>
thickness (T20 + T23) of the developer supplying section 36 (e.g., the external thickness (T21 + T22) of the<br>
developer housing section 30 is within about 5 mm of the external thickness (T20 + T23) of the developer<br>
supplying section 36).<br>
[0517] In some embodiments, the external thickness (T20 + T23) of the developer supplying section<br>
36 may be greater than an internal thickness (T24 + T25) of the developer housing section 30. Also, by<br>
modifying the shape (e.g., flattening) of the upper frame, it is possible to provide a developer cartridge in which<br>
the external thickness of the developer housing section is less than the external thickness of the developer<br>
supplying section.<br>
[0518] The external thickness (T21 + T22) of the developer housing section 30 is determined with<br>
reference to the positioning member 84. Therefore, in exemplary embodiments, the positioning member 84 is<br>
prevented from hindering attachment/detachment of the developer cartridge 728 with respect to the main casing<br>
2. As a result, smooth attachment and detachment of the developer cartridge 728 to the main casing 2 can be<br>
performed.<br>
[0519] Furthermore, the external thickness (T20 + T23) of the developer supplying section 36 of the<br>
developer cartridge casing 729 is determined with reference to the ribs 311 positioned on the lower surface of<br>
the back portion 43 of the developer cartridge casing 729. Therefore, in exemplary embodiments, the ribs 311<br>
are prevented from hindering attachment/detachment of the developer cartridge 728 with respect to the main<br>
casing 2. As a result, smooth attachment and detachment of the developer cartridge 728 to the main casing 2<br>
can be performed.<br>
[0520] In addition, the thickness of the ribs 311 may decrease from the developer housing section 30<br>
toward the developer supplying section 36 side (back side), hi such a case, the ribs 311 on the developer<br>
supplying section 36 may have a relatively smaller thickness than the ribs 311 on the developer housing section<br>
30. The ribs 311 may be formed such that the contacting surfaces of the ribs 311 with the sheet 3 are positioned<br>
substantially horizontally when the developer cartridge 728 is attached to the main casing 2 with the top surface<br>
of the developer cartridge 728 being horizontal. Therefore, the sheet 3 can be properly guided inside the main<br>
casing 2.<br>
[0521] In the above description, a component is referred to as being attachable/detachable if the<br>
component can be easily attached/detached to/from another component without requiring, for example,<br>
excessive assembly or disassembly of the components in order to attach/detach the component from the other<br>
component. Thus, while a component may be referred to as being undetachable, the component may be<br>
detached if, for example, it is intentionally pried open or if screws, etc., are removed. Similarly, while a<br>
component may be referred to as being detachable, the component is meant to be easily detachable such as, for<br>
example, by simply being pulled out or being capable of being pulled out after a releasing means, for example,<br>
is engaged.<br>
[0522] While the various aspects of the invention have been described in conjunction with exemplary<br>
embodiments outlined above, many alternatives, modifications and variations will be apparent to those skilled in<br>
the art. Accordingly, the exemplary embodiments as set forth above, are intended to be illustrative and not<br>
limiting. Various changes may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the various aspects of<br>
the invention.<br>
