				<td>The    present    invention    relates    to    2,4,5-trisubstituted    phenylketoenols compounds of the formula (I) and process thereof.<br>
The invention relates to new phenyl-substituted cyclic ketoenols, several processes and intermediate products for their preparation and their use as pest control agents and herbicides.<br>
It has already been disclosed that certain phenyl-substituted cyclic ketoenols are active as insecticides, acaricides and/or herbicides.<br>
Pharmaceutical properties have already been described for 3-acyl-pyrrolidine-2,4-diones (S. Suzuki et al. Chem. Pharm. Bull. 15 1120 (1967)). Furthermore, N-phenylpyrrolidine-2,4-diones have been synthesized by R. Schmierer and H. Mildenberger (Liebigs Ann. Chem. 1985, 1095). No biological activity has been described for these compounds.<br>
EP-A-0 262 399 and GB-A-2 266 888 disclose compounds of similar structure (3-aryl-pyrrolidine-2,4-diones), of which, however, no herbicidal, insecticidal or acaricidal action has been disclosed. Known compounds which have a herbicidal, insecticidal or acaricidal action are unsubstituted, bicyclic 3-aryl-pyrrolidine-2,4-dione derivatives (EP-A-355 599 and EP-A-415 211) and substituted monocyclic 3-aryl-pyrrolidine-2,4-dione derivatives (EP-A-377 893 and EP-A-442 077).<br>
Compounds which are furthermore known are polycyclic 3-arylpyrrolidine-2,4-dione derivatives (EP-A-442 073) and lH-arylpyrrolidine-dione derivatives (EP-A-456 063, EP-A-521 334, EP-A-596 298, EP-A-613 884, EP-A-613 885, DE 44 40 594, WO 94/01 997 and WO 95/01 358).<br>
It is known that certain substituted A -dihydrofuran-2-one derivatives have herbicidal properties (cf. DE-A-4 014 420). The synthesis of the tetronic acid derivatives used as starting compounds (such as, for example, 3-(2-methyl-phenyl)-4-hydroxy-5-(4-fluorophenyl)-Δ3-dihydrofuran-2-one) is likewise described in DE-A-4 014 420. Compounds of similar structure, without an insecticidal and/or acaricidal activity being mentioned, are known from the publication Campbell et al., J. Chem. Soc, Perkin Trans. 1, 1985. (8) 1567-76. 3-Aryl-Δ3-dihydrofuranone derivatives having herbicidal, acaricidal and insecticidal properties are furthermore known from EP-A-528 156, EP-A 0 647 637 and WO 95/26345.<br><br>
Certain phenyl-pyrone derivatives which are unsubstituted in the phenyl ring have already been disclosed (cf. AM. Chirazi, T. Kappe and E. Ziegler, Arch. Pharm. 309, 558 (1976) and K.-H. Boltze and K. Heidenbluth, Chem. Ber. 9JL, 2849), no possible usefulness of these compounds as pest control agents being mentioned. Phenyl-pyrone derivatives which are substituted in the phenyl ring and have herbicidal, acaricidal and insecticidal properties are described in EP-A-588 137.<br>
Certain 5-phenyl-l,3-thiazine derivatives which are unsubstituted in the phenyl ring have already been disclosed (cf. E. Ziegler and E. Steiner, Monatsh. 95, 147 (1964), R. Ketcham, T. Kappe and E. Ziegler, J. Heterocycl. Chem. 10, 223 (1973)), no possible use as pest control agents being mentioned for these compounds. 5-Phenyl-l,3-thiazine derivatives which are substituted in the phenyl ring and have a herbicidal, acaricidal and insecticidal action are described in WO 94/14 785.<br>
However, the acaricidal and insecticidal activity and/or range of action and the plant tolerance of these compounds, in particular with respect to crop plants, is not always adequate. Statement of Invention<br>

Psoroptes spp., Chorioptes spp., Sarcoptes spp., Tarsonemus spp., Bryobia<br>
praetiosa, Panonychus spp. and Tetranychus spp.<br>
The active compounds according to the invention are distinguished by a high<br>
insecticidal and acaricidal activity.<br>
They can be employed particularly successfully against insects which are harmful<br>
to plants, such as, for example, against the larvae of the mustard beetle (Phaedon<br>
cochleariae) or against the larvae of the rice green leafhopper (Nephotettix<br>
cincticeps) and against the larvae of the cabbage moth (Plutella maculipennis).<br>
The active compounds according to the invention can furthermore be used as<br>
defoliants, desiccants, agents for destroying broad-leaved plants and, especially, as<br>
weed-killers. By weeds, in the broadest sense, there are to be understood all plants<br>
which grow in locations where they are undesired. Whether the substances<br>
according to the invention act as total or selective herbicides depends essentially<br>
on the amount used.<br>
The dosages of the active compounds according to the invention necessary for<br>
combating weeds are between 0.001 and 10 kg/ha, preferably between 0.005 and<br>
5 kg/ha.<br>
The active compounds according to the invention can be used, for example, in<br>
connection with the following plants:<br>
Dicotyledon weeds of the genera: Sinapis, Lepidium, Galium, Stellaria,<br>
Matricaria, Anthemis, Galinsoga, Chenopodium, Urtica, Senecio, Amaranthus,<br>
Portulaca, Xanthium, Convolvulus, Ipomoea, Polygonum, Sesbania, Ambrosia,<br>
Cirsium, Carduus, Sonchus, Solanum, Rorippa, Rotala, Lindernia, Lamium,<br>
Veronica, Abutilon, Emex, Datura, Viola, Galeopsis, Papaver, Centaurea,<br>
Trifolium, Ranunculus and Taraxacum.<br>
- 88 -<br>
Dicotyledon cultures of the genera: Gossypium, Glycine, Beta, Daucus,<br>
Phaseolus, Pisum, Solanum, Linum, Ipomoea, Vicia, Nicotiana, Lycopersicon,<br>
Arachis, Brassica, Lactuca, Cucumis and Cucurbita.<br>
Monocotyledon weeds of the genera: Echinochloa, Setaria, Panicum, Digitaria,<br>
Phleum, Poa, Festuca, Eleusine, Brachiaria, Lolium, Bromus, Avena, Cyperus,<br>
Sorghum, Agropyron, Cycnodon, Monochoria, Fimbristylis, Sagittaria, Eleocharis,<br>
Scirpus, Paspalum, Ischaemum, Sphenoclea, Dactyloctenium, Agrostis, Alopecurus<br>
and Apera.<br>
Monocotyledon cultures of the genera: Oryza, Zea, Triticum, Hordeum, Avena,<br>
Secale, Sorghum, Panicum, Saccharum, Ananas, Asparagus and Allium.<br>
However, the use of the active compounds according to the invention is in no way<br>
restricted to these genera, but also extends in the same manner to other plants.<br>
The compounds are suitable, depending on the concentration, for the total<br>
combating of weeds, for example on industrial terrain and rail tracks, and on paths<br>
and squares with or without tree plantings. Equally, the compounds can be<br>
employed for combating weeds in perennial cultures, for example afforestations,<br>
decorative tree plantings, orchards, vineyards, citrus groves, nut orchards, banana<br>
plantations, coffee plantations, tea plantations, rubber plantations, oil palm<br>
plantations, cocoa plantations, soft fruit plantings and hop fields, on ornamental<br>
and sports lawns and meadow areas and for the selective combating of weeds in<br>
annual cultures.<br>
The active compounds according to the invention are particularly suitable for<br>
selectively combating monocotyledon weeds in dicotyledon crops by the pre- and<br>
post-emergence method. For example, they can be employed very successfully for<br>
combating harmful grasses in cotton or sugar beet.<br>
The active compounds can be converted into the customary formulations, such as<br>
solutions, emulsions, wettable powders, suspensions, powders, dusting agents,<br>
pastes, soluble powders, granules, suspension-emulsion concentrates, natural and<br>
synthetic materials impregnated with active compound, and very fine capsules in<br>
polymeric substances.<br>
- 89 -<br>
These formulations are produced in a known manner, for example by mixing the<br>
active compounds with extenders, that is liquid solvents and/or solid carriers,<br>
optionally with the use of surface-active agents, that is emulsifying agents and/or<br>
dispersing agents and/or foam-forming agents.<br>
In the case of the use of water as an extender, organic solvents can, for example,<br>
also be used as auxiliary solvents. As liquid solvents, there are suitable in the<br>
main: aromatics, such as xylene, toluene or alkylnaphthalenes, chlorinated<br>
aromatics and chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbons, such as chlorobenzenes,<br>
chloroethylenes or methylene chloride, aliphatic hydrocarbons, such as<br>
cyclohexane or paraffins, for example petroleum fractions, mineral and vegetable<br>
oils, alcohols, such as butanol or glycol as well as their ethers and esters, ketones,<br>
such as acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone or cyclohexanone,<br>
strongly polar solvents, such as dimethylformamide and dimethyl sulphoxide, as<br>
well as water.<br>
As solid carriers there are suitable:<br>
for example, ammonium salts and ground natural minerals, such as kaolins, clays,<br>
talc, chalk, quartz, attapulgite, montmorillonite or diatomaceous earth, and ground<br>
synthetic minerals, such as highly disperse silica, alumina and silicates; as solid<br>
carriers for granules there are suitable: for example, crushed and fractionated<br>
natural rocks such as calcite, marble, pumice, sepiolite and dolomite, as well as<br>
synthetic granules of inorganic and organic meals, and granules of organic<br>
material such as sawdust, coconut shells, maize cobs and tobacco stalks; as<br>
emulsifying and/or foam-forming agents there are suitable: for example, non-ionic<br>
and anionic emulsifiers, such as polyoxyethylene fatty acid esters, polyoxyethylene<br>
fatty alcohol ethers, for example alkylaryl polyglycol ethers, alkyl sulphonates,<br>
alkyl sulphates, aryl sulphonates as well as albumen hydrolysis products; as<br>
dispersing agents there are suitable: for example, lignin-sulphite waste liquors and<br>
methylcellulose.<br>
Adhesives such as carboxymethylcellulose and natural and synthetic polymers in<br>
the form of powders, granules or latexes, such as gum arabic, polyvinyl alcohol<br>
and polyvinyl acetate, as well as natural phospholipids, such as cephalins and<br>
lecithins, and synthetic phospholipids, can be used in the formulations. Further<br>
additives can be mineral and vegetable oils.<br>
- 90 -<br>
It is possible to use colorants such as inorganic pigments, for example iron oxide,<br>
titanium oxide and Prussian Blue, and organic dyestuffs, such as alizarin dyestuffs,<br>
azo dyestuffs and metal phthalocyanine dyestuffs, and trace nutrients such as salts<br>
of iron, manganese, boron, copper, cobalt, molybdenum and zinc.<br>
The formulations in general contain between 0.1 and 95% by weight of active<br>
compound, preferably between 0.5 and 90%.<br>
The active compound according to the invention can be present in its<br>
commercially available formulations and in the use forms prepared from these<br>
formulations as a mixture with other active compounds, such as insecticides, baits,<br>
sterilizing agents, acaricides, nematicides, fungicides, growth-regulating substances<br>
or herbicides. The insecticides include, for example, phosphoric acid esters,<br>
carbamates, carboxylic acid esters, chlorinated hydrocarbons, phenylureas,<br>
substances produced by microorganisms, and the like.<br>

The active compounds according to the invention are used in the veterinary sector<br>
in a known manner by enteral administration in the form of, for example, tablets,<br>
capsules, potions, drenches, granules, pastes, boli, the feed-through process and<br>
suppositories, by parenteral administration, such as, for example, by injections<br>
(intra-muscular, subcutaneous, intravenous, intraperitoneal etc), implants, by nasal<br>
administration, by dermal use in the form, for example, of dipping or bathing,<br>
spraying, pouring on and spotting on, washing and powdering, and also with the<br>
aid of moulded articles containing the active compound, such as collars, ear<br>
marks, tail marks, limb bands, halters, marking devices, etc.<br>
When used for livestock, poultry, pets and the like, the active compounds of the<br>
formula (I) can be used as formulations (for example powders, emulsions,<br>
compositions capable of flow) which comprise the active compounds in an amount<br>
of 1 to 80% by weight, directly or after 100 to 10,000-fold dilution, or they can be<br>
used as a chemical bath.<br>
It has furthermore been found that the compounds of the formula I according to<br>
the invention display a high insecticidal action against insects which destroy<br>
industrial materials.<br>
The following insects may be mentioned as examples and preferred - but without<br>
being limited:<br>
Beetles, such as<br>

Industrial materials in the present connection are to be understood as meaning<br>
non-living materials, such as, preferably, plastics, adhesives, sizes, papers and<br>
cards, leather, wood and processed wood products, and lacquers and paints.<br>
Material to be preserved from insect damage which is quite particularly preferred<br>
is wood and processed wood products.<br>
Wood and processed wood products which can be protected by the agents<br>
according to the invention or mixtures comprising these are to be understood as<br>
meaning, for example: building timber, wooden beams, railway sleepers, bridge<br>
components, boat gangplanks, wooden vehicles, crates, pallets, containers,<br>
telegraph masts, wood lagging, wooden windows and doors, plywood, chipboards,<br>
joinery or wood products used quite generally in house construction or building<br>
joinery.<br>
The active compounds can be used as such or in the form of concentrates or<br>
generally customary formulations, such as powders, granules, solutions,<br>
suspensions, emulsions or pastes.<br>
The formulations mentioned can be prepared in a manner known per se, for<br>
example by mixing the active compounds with at least one solvent or diluent,<br>
emulsifier, dispersing agent and/or binder or fixing agent, water repellant,<br>
optionally siccatives and UV stabilizers, and if appropriate dyestuffs and pigments,<br>
as well as other processing auxiliaries.<br>
The insecticidal compositions or concentrates used for preservation of wood and<br>
derived timber products comprise the active compound according to the invention<br>
in a concentration of 0.0001 to 95% by weight, in particular 0.001 to 60% by<br>
weight.<br>
The amount of composition or concentrate employed depends on the nature and<br>
the occurrence of the insects and on the medium. The optimum amount employed<br>
for the use can in each case be determined by a series of tests. In general,<br>
however, it is sufficient to employ 0.0001 to 20% by weight, preferably 0.001 to<br>
10% by weight, of the active compound based on the material to be preserved.<br>
The solvent and/or diluent used is an organochemical solvent or solvent mixture<br>
and/or an oily or oil-like organochemical solvent or solvent mixture of low<br>
volatility and/or a polar organochemical solvent or solvent mixture and/or water<br>
and, if appropriate, an emulsifier and/or wetting agent.<br>
Oily or oil-like solvents having an evaporation number above 35 and a flash point<br>
above 30°C, preferably above 45°C, are preferably employed as organochemical<br>
solvents. Corresponding mineral oils or aromatic fractions thereof or solvent<br>
mixtures containing mineral oil, preferably white spirit, petroleum and/or<br>
alkylbenzene, are used as such water-insoluble, oily and oil-like solvents of low<br>
volatility.<br>
Mineral oils having a boiling range from 170 to 220°C, white spirit having a<br>
boiling range from 170 to 220°C, spindle oil having a boiling range from 250 to<br>
350°C, petroleum or aromatics having a boiling range from 160 to 280°C,<br>

from 180 to 210°C or high-boiling mixtures of aromatic and aliphatic<br>
hydrocarbons having a boiling range from 180 to 220°C and/or spindle oil and/or<br>
monochloronaphthalene, preferably oc-monochloronaphthalene, are employed.<br>
The organic oily or oil-like solvents of low volatility having an evaporation<br>
number above 35 and a flash point above 30°C, preferably above 45°C, can be<br>
replaced in part by organochemical solvents of high or medium volatility, provided<br>
that the solvent mixture likewise has an evaporation number above 35 and a flash<br>
point above 30°C, preferably above 45°C, and that the insecticide/fungicide<br>
mixture is soluble or can be emulsified in this solvent mixture.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment, some of the organochemical solvent or<br>
mixture. Aliphatic organochemical solvents containing hydroxyl and/or ester<br>
and/or ether groups, such as, for example, glycol ethers, esters or the like, are<br>
preferably used.<br>
Organochemical binders which are the synthetic resins and/or binding drying oils<br>
which are water-dilutable and/or soluble or dispersible or emulsifiable in the<br>
organochemical solvents employed and are known per se, in particular binders<br>
consisting of or comprising an acrylate resin, a vinyl resin, for example polyvinyl<br>
acetate, polyester resin, polycondensation or polyaddition resin, polyurethane resin,<br>
alkyd resin or modified alkyd resin, phenolic resin, hydrocarbon resin, such as<br>
indene-coumarone resin or silicone resin, drying plant and/or drying oils and/or<br>
binders which dry by physical means and are based on a naturally occurring<br>
and/or synthetic resin.<br>
The synthetic resin used as the binder can be employed in the form of an<br>
emulsion, dispersion or solution. Bitumen or bituminous substances can also be<br>
used as binders in an amount of up to 10% by weight. In addition, dyestuffs,<br>
pigments, water-repellant agents, odour correctants and inhibitors or corrosion<br>
prevention agents and the like which are known per se can be employed.<br>
Preferably, according to the invention, the composition or concentrate comprises at<br>
least one alkyd resin or modified alkyd resin and/or one drying plant oil as an<br>
organochemical binder. Alkyd resins having an oil content of more than 45% by<br>
weight, preferably 50 to 68% by weight, are preferably used according to the<br>
invention.<br>
All or some of the binder mentioned can be replaced by a fixing agent (mixture)<br>
or a plasticizer (mixture). These additives are intended to prevent evaporation of<br>
the active compounds and crystallization or precipitation They preferably replace<br>
0.01 to 30% of the binder (based on 100% of the binder employed).<br>
The plasticizers originate from the chemical classes of phthalic acid esters, such as<br>
dibutyl, dioctyl or benzyl butyl phthalate, phosphoric acid esters, such as tributyl<br>
phosphate, adipic acid esters, such as di-(2-ethylhexyl) adipate, stearates, such as<br>
butyl stearate or amyl stearate, oleates, such as butyl oleate, glycerol ethers or<br>
higher molecular weight glycol ethers, glycerol esters and p-toluenesulphonic acid<br>
esters.<br>
Fixing agents are based chemically on polyvinyl alkyl ethers, such as, for<br>
example, polyvinyl methyl ether, or ketones, such as benzophenone or<br>
ethy leneb enzophenone.<br>
Water in particular is also a possible solvent or diluent, if appropriate mixed with<br>
one or more of the abovementioned organochemical solvents or diluents,<br>
emulsifiers and dispersing agents.<br>
Particularly effective wood preservation is achieved by impregnation processes on<br>
a large industrial scale, for example vacuum, a double vacuum or pressure<br>
processes.<br>
If appropriate, the ready-to-use compositions can also comprise other insecticides,<br>
and if appropriate also one or more fungicides.<br>
Possible additional admixing partners are, preferably, the insecticides and<br>
fungicides mentioned in WO 94/29 268. The compounds mentioned in this<br>
document are an express constituent of the present application.<br>
Especially preferred admixing partners can be insecticides, such as chlorpyriphos,<br>
phoxim, silafluofin, alphamethrin, cyfluthrin, cypermethrin, deltamethrin,<br>
permethrin, imidacloprid, NI-25, flufenoxuron, hexaflumuron and triflumuron,<br>
and fungicides, such as epoxyconazole, hexaconazole, azaconazole, propiconazole,<br>
tebuconazole, cyproconazole, metconazole, imazalil, dichlorfluanid, tolylfluanid, 3-<br>
iodo-2-propinyl butylcarbamate, N-octyl-isothiazolin-3-one and 4,5-dichloro-Noctylisothiazolin-<br>

Example H<br>
Test with fly larvae / development-inhibiting action<br>
Test animals: All larval stages of Lucilia cuprina (OP-resistant)<br>
[pupae and adults (without contact with the active compound)]<br>
Solvent: 35 parts by weight of ethylene glycol monomethyl ether<br>
35 parts by weight of nonylphenol polyglycol ether<br>
To produce a suitable formulation, 3 parts by weight of active compound are<br>
mixed with seven parts of the abovementioned solvent/emulsifier mixture and the<br>
emulsion concentrate thus obtained is diluted with water to the particular desired<br>
concentration.<br>
30 to 50 larvae per concentration are introduced onto horse-meat (1 cm3), in glass<br>
tubes, onto which 500 \i\ of the dilution to be tested are pipetted. The glass tubes<br>
are placed in plastic beakers, the base of which is covered with beach sand, and<br>
are stored in a climatically controlled room (26°C ± 1.5°C, 70% relative humidity<br>
± 10%). The action is checked after 24 hours and 48 hours (larvicidal action).<br>
After emergence of the larvae (about 72 hours), the glass tubes are removed and<br>
perforated plastic lids are placed on the beakers. After \Vi times the development<br>
period (hatching of the control flies), the flies which have hatched and the<br>
pupae/pupae cases are counted.<br>
The criterion for the action is the onset of death among the treated larvae after<br>
48 hours (larvicidal effect) or the inhibition of hatching of adults from the pupae<br>
or the inhibition of pupae formation. The criterion for the in vitro action of a<br>
substance is the inhibition of flea development or a halt in development before the<br>
adult stage. 100% larvicidal action means that all the larvae have died after 48<br>
hours. 100% development-inhibiting action means that no adult flies have hatched.<br>
In this test, for example, the compound according to Preparation Example I-4-a-l<br>
caused an action of 100% at an active compound concentration of, for example,<br>
1000 ppm.<br>

into the abdomen and the animals are transferred to dishes and kept in a<br>
climatically controlled room. The action is determined via the inhibition of<br>
oviposition. 100% means that no tick has laid.<br>

Example H<br>
Test with fly larvae / development-inhibiting action<br>
Test animals: All larval stages of Lucilia cuprina (OP-resistant)<br>
[pupae and adults (without contact with the active compound)]<br>
Solvent: 35 parts by weight of ethylene glycol monomethyl ether<br>
35 parts by weight of nonylphenol polyglycol ether<br>
To produce a suitable formulation, 3 parts by weight of active compound are<br>
mixed with seven parts of the abovementioned solvent/emulsifier mixture and the<br>
emulsion concentrate thus obtained is diluted with water to the particular desired<br>
concentration.<br>
30 to 50 larvae per concentration are introduced onto horse-meat (1 cm3), in glass<br>
tubes, onto which 500 \i\ of the dilution to be tested are pipetted. The glass tubes<br>
are placed in plastic beakers, the base of which is covered with beach sand, and<br>
are stored in a climatically controlled room (26°C ± 1.5°C, 70% relative humidity<br>
± 10%). The action is checked after 24 hours and 48 hours (larvicidal action).<br>
After emergence of the larvae (about 72 hours), the glass tubes are removed and<br>
perforated plastic lids are placed on the beakers. After \Vi times the development<br>
period (hatching of the control flies), the flies which have hatched and the<br>
pupae/pupae cases are counted.<br>
The criterion for the action is the onset of death among the treated larvae after<br>
48 hours (larvicidal effect) or the inhibition of hatching of adults from the pupae<br>
or the inhibition of pupae formation. The criterion for the in vitro action of a<br>
substance is the inhibition of flea development or a halt in development before the<br>
adult stage. 100% larvicidal action means that all the larvae have died after 48<br>
hours. 100% development-inhibiting action means that no adult flies have hatched.<br>
In this test, for example, the compound according to Preparation Example I-4-a-l<br>
caused an action of 100% at an active compound concentration of, for example,<br>
1000 ppm.<br>

The test is carried out as a 5-fold determination. 1 (il of the solutions is injected<br>
into the abdomen and the animals are transferred to dishes and kept in a<br>
climatically controlled room. The action is determined via the inhibition of<br>
oviposition. 100% means that no tick has laid.<br>
In this test, for example, the compounds according to Preparation Examples I-4-a-<br>
1 and I-4-b-l had an action of 100% at an active compound concentration of, for<br>
