				<td>. Summary of dis-advantage of prior Arts: -<br>
The Mechanical Water Over-Flow Control System is a Mechanical Equipment and it needs no electricity for working. It works only on the pressure of the water of Water Tank of any house. It is very cheap and can be installed by a simple person easily. This Mechanical Water Over-Flow Control System install on the top at outside of a Water Tank. The work of Mechanical Water Over-Flow Control System is that when, the Water-Tank fully fill with water, then, this Mechanical Water Over-Flow Control System stops the electric supply of the electric Motor of the consumer and Mechanical Water Over-Flow Control System helps the consumer in saving invaluable water and electricity. Mechanical Water Over-Flow Control System also helps the consumers in saving their houses from moistures/wetness and raises the life of the houses of the consumers. The list of losses can be occurred due to the over-flow of water of a Water Tank is as below: -<br>
1.	Due to the Over-Flow of water of Water Tank, the invaluable water wastes in drains daily because the consumers cannot know about the over-flow of water of Water Tank at that exact time when the Water Tank fully filled with water.<br>
2.	Due to the Over-Flow of water of Water Tank, the undesirable water stores on the roof by which many diseases occurred and it can very danger to the life of the people.<br>
3.	Due to the Over-Flow of water of Water Tank, the undesirable water stores on the roof and it can create moistures/wetness in the house due to winch the house can damage and can destroy before time.<br>
4.	The consumers cannot switched off the electric Motor because they cannot know about the over-flow of water of Water Tank at that exact time when the Water Tank fully filled with water and they would have to suffer great loss of costly electricity and invaluable water.<br>
5.	The consumers wait for the fully filling of the Water Tank for a long time, but it disturbs them and waste their valuable time.<br>
Many Equipments are available in the market for stopping over-flow of water of<br>
Water Tank, but all these are danger in use and are very costly. The details of<br>
some this kind of equipments are as below: -<br>
1. Air Cock Ball System.<br>
Air Cock Ball System install at the mouth of a pipe by which the water filled in the Water Tank and the said pipe is located inside the Water<br>
Tank into the water. This Air Cock Ball System stop the water supply after fully filling the Water Tank, but the electric Motor remains in running position due to which the electric Motor can spoiled and the consumer would have to suffer a great loss of money.<br>
2.	Para Swtich<br>
It is very danger to stops the over-flow of water of Water Tank with this kind of equipment, because this Para Switch contains Para Metal and it install inside the Water Tank into the water and there is always a danger of mixing the water and para into the Water Tank and in that case it would be very danger for life of the consumers.<br>
3.	Limit Switch<br>
The Limit Switch is a electric component and it install inside the Water Tank and as such, there is always a danger of touching this Limit Switch with the water and in that case if it occurred, it can create electric current in fully water supply and would very danger for the live of the consumers and their family.<br>
4.	Other Eelctronic Equipments<br>
There are some Electronic Equipments in the market for stopping overflow of water of Water Tank, but it is also danger to use these types of electronic equipments, because it works on 6 or 12 Volts Electricity Power (DC) which makes from 250 Volts Electricity Power (AC) by a Circuit after a very long time. If this Circuit occurs any problem, then, the<br>
whole system stops working and it can be a reason of an accident. These<br>
types of Electronic Equipments are very costly in its price and it expand<br>
too much electricity in its working and hence, it is very costly in its use<br>
also. Life of these kinds of the Electric Equipments are generally very<br>
short.<br>
All the aforesaid Equipments and other equipments which are available in the<br>
market install in the inside of the Water Tank and there are always a danger of<br>
occurring any accident in use of these kinds of the equipments and hence, the<br>
people does not like these systems and waste daily the invaluable water and<br>
very costly Electricity. The Mechanical Water Over-Flow Control System is the<br>
first Water Over-Flow Control Systems which install on the outside of the<br>
Water Tank and signals about the position of the Water Tank whether it is full<br>
or not. The Mechanical Water Over-Flow Control System is very cheap and can<br>
be easily taken by a simple person. There are no expenditure in running of the<br>
Mechanical Water Over-Flow Control System after installation. Hence, the<br>
Mechanical Water Over-Flow Control System is the best water over-flow<br>
Control System.<br>
INSTALLATION OF THE MECHANICAL WATER OVER-FLOW CONTROL SYSTE1 .<br>
The over-flow of the water is a very great problem and the people are facing this problem daily and everybody fails to solve this problem. We solve this problem after the invention of the MECHANICAL WATER OVER-FLOW CONTROL SYSTEM. The details of MECHANICAL WATER OVER-FLOW CONTROL SYSTEM are as below: -<br>
The MECHANICAL WATER OVER-FLOW CONTROL SYSTEM install on the top at outside of a Water Tank and it binds with two nuts. An insulator Ball install into the water inside the Water Tank with a insulator rod for the working of this System. When, the Water Tank fully filled with water, then, the aforesaid insulator Ball pushes the equipment and thereafter this equipment cut the power supply of the Electric Motor. The Electric Motor cannot be restart automatically until we do not start the same. A Four-Cour Cable connects with System and N phase of the Electric Motor and it performs the main part in stopping the electric Motor after fully filling the Water Tank. This system works as a Two-way Switch by which we can start our Electric Motor. There is a Panel Board in the MECHANICAL WATER OVER-FLOW CONTROL SYSTEM and a Signal Light is also installed in the Panel Board which signals about the position of the Water Tank whether it is full or not.<br>
ADVANTAGES   OF   THE   MECHANICAL WATER OVER-FLOW CONTROL SYSTEM<br>
It is very easy to install the MECHANICAL WATER OVER-FLOW SYSTEM. It install on the top at the outside of the Water Tank. It is fully safe in use because it is installed outside the Water Tank and it cannot touch the water and cannot create any danger. It is a very cheap system and this system has no expenditure in its running as it works on the pressure of the water which available with any cost. It stops the over-flow of water from Water Tanks and solves the problem of stores of undesirable water and helps in controlling the diseases, which occurs due to the storage of undesirable water. This System also helps in saving the invaluable water and electricity. There is no danger in use of this System. This System also saves the very valuable time of consumers, which they waste in waiting the fully filling of Water Tank. There are few chances of problem in the System because it has a very small Circuit. This System works as a two way switch. The Electric Motor can be operate by this System which install on the top at outside of Water Tank and at the time of cleaning the Water Tank, the consumer have no need to go down to switch on/off the electric Motor, because by this System the Electric Motor can be switch on/off on the roof of house where generally the Water Tank locates. The MECHANICAL WATER OVER-FLOW SYSTEM requires a very short time for repairing and installation.<br>
