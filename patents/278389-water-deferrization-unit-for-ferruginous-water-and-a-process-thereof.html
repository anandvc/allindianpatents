				<td>"WATER DEFERRIZATION UNIT FOR FERRUGINOUS WATER AND A<br>
PROCESS THEREOF-FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a water deferrization unit capable of providing filtered water containing about or less than 0.3 ppm iron. The present invention particularly relates to a water deferrization unit which treats water containing iron up to 40 ppm. The present invention also relates to a process of treating high iron content water using novel deferrization unit. BACKGROUND AND PRIOR ART<br>
Different designs of iron removal plants have been developed by various agencies to get rid of excess iron from water. These iron removal plants are of DANIDA type, WHO type, BASTER type and the 'HAND PUMP ATTACHABLE IRON REMOVAL PLANT' adopted by Bureau of Indian Standards, IS 12918: 1990.<br>
One of the drawbacks of DANIDA type iron removal plant is the absence of the sedimentation chamber, which lowers efficiency of the filter media. Another drawback of this plant is that it is suitable for ferruginous water containing 7-8 ppm iron only.<br>
The WHO type iron removal plant does not have any sedimentation chamber and gravity filtration is used which leads to early chocking of filter bed necessitating frequent cleaning. Another drawback of WHO type plant is that backwash is not possible in hand pump schemes. Yet another drawback of this plant is that it is suitable for ferruginous water containing 7-8 ppm iron only.<br>
The drawback of BASTER type iron removal plant is that complete cleaning of filter water chamber is complicated due to its direct inaccessibility and the maintenance requirement is high. Another drawback of this plant is that it is suitable for ferruginous water containing 7-8 ppm of iron only.<br>
The drawback of the Bureau of Indian Standards adopted iron removal plant is that cleaning of filter bed is carried out with unfiltered water, through filter water chamber, contaminating the filter water chamber. Another disadvantage of this iron removal plant is that complete cleaning of filter water<br>
chamber is complicated due to its direct inaccessibility. Yet another disadvantage is that the overflow pipe given in filter chamber leads to settled water overflow.<br>
There is a need for an efficient water deferrization unit to deliver water having 0.3 ppm iron and the installation, operation and maintenance of which is easier, can be installed in remote areas, can be fabricated and assembled even in rural conditions and can deliver drinking water of desired quality in respect of iron content even in rural areas from ferruginous water containing as high as 40 ppm iron.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
Filtration tank (2) is cylindrical in shape having four chambers viz. sedimentation (11), up flow filtration (12), gravity flow filtration (13) and filter water (14) chamber. These chambers are housed in cylindrical main body, separated by partitions having openings for flow of water. The base of the filtration tank is elevated along the central partition (15) of the two filtration chambers. At the upper end of sedimentation chamber a removable perforated tray (16) is placed over another removal perforated tray (17). These two trays contain chemically treated gravels (18). The sedimentation chamber is also fitted with an over flow pipe (19). The sedimentation chamber is connected to the up flow filtration chamber with horizontal opening (20) at the bottom of the partition separating them. A sludge out let valve (21) is fitted at the lower most end of the sedimentation chamber.<br>
The up flow filtration chamber houses a perforated tray (22) on which rests, the support gravel (23) and sand (24). Through openings (25) in the central partition, the up flow filtration chamber is connected with the gravity flow filtration chamber. One backwash outlet valve (26) is fitted outside the up flow filtration chamber.<br>
The gravity flow filtration chamber also houses a removable perforated tray (27) on which rests the support gravel and sand. One back wash outlet valve (28) is also fitted outside gravity flow filtration chamber. The gravity flow filtration chamber is connected with the filter water chamber through a horizontal opening (29) at the bottom of partition separating them. The filter water chamber is fitted with a filter water outlet (30) and a backwash outlet valve (31). The filtration tank is fitted with handles (32) and rests on legs (33). The aeration system (6) consists of an upper convex disc (34), a lower convex disc (35) and a perforated concave disc (36). The raw water inlet pipe (37) is horizontal up to the center of the base (38) of aeration system and then through a 90° turn stands vertically. The three discs, as mentioned above are fitted coaxially over vertical portion of the raw water inlet pipe with adjustable knob (39). The aeration base serves as a cover of filtration tank and has holes (40) at one end for flow of aerated water to the sedimentation chamber. The aeration system is removable and fitted with handles (41).<br>
Top portion (42) of cover (8) for aeration system is dome shaped and is fully covered and sides (43) consist of MS mesh and fitted with handles (44). This cover will prevent the aeration system as well as the filtration tank from any leaf, litter or rain water etc. into the system.<br>
The doser stand (9) is fitted at the upper end of the sedimentation chamber, with fitting device (45) and has a rest base (46) for doser.<br>
The doser bottle (10) is fitted with a tap (47) and a tube (48).<br>
INSTALLATION<br>
The filtration tank is placed on horizontally levelled hard stand on ground level near water source. The doser stand is fitted outside the sedimentation chamber and the doser container containing lime suspensions is placed on doser stand. The iron oxide coated gravels are then spread on to the two trays of sedimentation chamber and support gravel and sand are spread on to the tray of up flow and gravity flow filtration chamber. The support gravel and filter sand are then cleaned till clear water accumulates in the filter water chamber. The aeration system is placed on the top of filtration tank in such a way so that the holes on the base of aeration system. placed above the sedimentation chamber. The cover of aeration system is placed over the aeration system. Water inlet of the water deferrization unit is connected to the water source, and all the valves and water outlet are closed.<br>
OPERATION<br>
The water inlet of water deferrization unit is connected to the raw / untreated water source. The untreated water passes through the water inlet pipe and then finds its way out at the other end of the pipe and then spread over on the top convex disc and from the periphery of this disc enters into the perforated concave disc. Through perforations of 1 concave disc the water enters and spread over on the top of lower convex disc and then from periphery of this disc enters on the base of aeration system. During operation of the unit lime suspensions are added drop wise through the tube of doser to raise the pH of v water above 7.0. The water exchanges gases while passing over this aeration system and the aerated water then flows to the filter tank<br>
through perforations on base of aeration system. In the filter tank water first flows over chemically treated gravel placed on removable perforated trays at the upper end of the sedimentation chamber and then flows to the sedimentation chamber while passing through the above system water exchanges I gases, increases pH and ferrous iron gets oxidized to ferric ion. In the sedimentation chamber, iron is coagulated and then it precipitates and settles at the bottom of the sedimentation chamber. Precipitated iron, 90 % (85 - 95%) are retained in this chamber and drained out periodically through sludge outlet. The water then finds it way to the up flow filtration chamber and passes through filtration media which retains the unsettled iron particles. From up flow filtration chamber water flows to the gravity filtration chamber through openings above the filtration media and passes through the gravity filtration device. This filter removes the fine particles of the unsettled iron and clear water enters to the filter water chamber. Clear water is tapped through the filtered water outlet.<br>
Performance evaluation of the water deferrization unit is given in Table -1.<br>
Also the comparison Table-2 shows the difference between various designs and the present invention<br>

Table -2: Comparison of various iron removal plants<br>
<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
MAINTENANCE OF WATER DEFERRIZATION UNIT<br>
Maintenance of the water deferrization unit is easierthan before. Periodic back washings are required in order to clean the filter media, as the voids are filled with iron particles. The sedimentation chamber is required to be cleaned weekly. The unit needs back washings at monthly intervals (depending on iron content of feed water) and the filter media needs replacement when there is no improvement in the filter efficiency even after back washings.<br>
Back washings and cleaning operations in sequence are done as under: (i)       The aeration system (6) and its cover (8) are removed from the top of<br>
the water deferrization unit.<br>
 (ii)      Treated water delivery tap (30) and sludge/ back wash out let valves<br>
(21, 26, 28 and 31) are closed and level of filtered water allowed to rise<br>
to its maximum, (iii)      Filter media, sand (24) of the gravity flow filtration chamber (13), is<br>
shaken / raked by hand. Back wash outlet valve (28) is opened and<br>
washed water is allowed to come out through this valve. Raking /<br>
shaking is to be continued till clear water accumulates over the filter<br>
bed. (iv)     Filter water chamber (14) is cleaned by opening the back wash outlet<br>
valve (31) and dirty water is drained off. (v)      Backwash outlet valves (28) and (31) are closed and level of filter water<br>
is allowed to rise to its maximum, (vi)     Filter media of the up flow filtration chamber (12) is shaken / raked.<br>
Back wash outlet valve (26) is opened and washed water is allowed to<br>
come out through this valve. Shaking/ raking is to be continued till clear<br>
water accumulate over the filter bed. (vii)     Sedimentation chamber (11) is cleaned by opening the sludge outlet<br>
valve (21) to drain out the dirty water, (viii)    Operations (ii) to (vii) are to be repeated if required, (ix)     Aeration system and its cover are replaced in original position and all<br>
valves are to be closed before operation of iron removal.<br>
