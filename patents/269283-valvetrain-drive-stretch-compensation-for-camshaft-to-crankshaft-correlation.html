				<td>VALVETRAIN DRIVE STRETCH COMPENSATION FOR<br>
CAMSHAFT TO CRANKSHAFT CORRELATION<br>
CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
[0001] This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional<br>
Application No. 60/962,045, filed on July 26, 2007. The disclosure of the above<br>
application is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.<br>
FIELD<br>
[0002] The present disclosure relates to internal combustion engines,<br>
and more particularly to compensating for valvetrain stretch for camshaft to<br>
crankshaft correlation.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0003] The statements in this section merely provide background<br>
information related to the present disclosure and may not constitute prior art.<br>
[0004] Internal combustion engines induce combustion of an air and<br>
fuel mixture to reciprocally drive pistons within cylinders. The pistons rotatably<br>
drive a crankshaft, which transfers drive torque to a driveline. Air is drawn into<br>
an intake manifold of the engine and is distributed to the cylinders. More<br>
specifically, the air, and in some engines the air and fuel mixture, enters the<br>
cylinder through one or more intake ports, which are each selectively opened via<br>
actuation of a corresponding intake valve. After combustion, the combustion<br><br>
gases are exhausted from the cylinder through one or more exhaust ports, each<br>
of which are selectively opened via actuation of a corresponding exhaust valve.<br>
[0005] The movement of the intake and exhaust valves, and thus the<br>
opening and closing of the intake and exhaust ports, is regulated by intake and<br>
exhaust camshafts. As the camshafts rotate, cam lobes of the respective<br>
camshafts induce movement of the respective valves. The camshafts are<br>
rotatably driven by the crankshaft via a timing sprocket and timing chain. The<br>
timing chain is driven by timing sprockets associated with the crankshaft and the<br>
camshafts to enable the crankshaft to drive the camshafts.<br>
[0006] The movements of the valves are timed to provide opening and<br>
closing of the ports at the proper times during the piston strokes. This timing is<br>
provided in terms of the rotational position of each of the intake and exhaust<br>
camshafts with respect to each other and with respect to the rotational position of<br>
the crankshaft. The rotational position of the crankshaft corresponds to the linear<br>
position of the pistons within their respective cylinders (e.g., bottom-dead-center<br>
(BDC), top-dead-center (TDC)).<br>
[0007] The rotational position of each of the camshafts with respect to<br>
the crankshaft performs an influential role in the combustion process. For<br>
example, the timing of the opening of the intake port with respect to the piston<br>
position influences the amount of air that is drawn into the cylinder during the<br>
expansion stroke of the piston. Similarly, the timing of the opening of the exhaust<br>
port with respect to the piston position influences the amount of combustion<br>
product gas that is exhausted from the cylinder.<br><br>
[0008] Accordingly, engine systems include sensors that monitor the<br>
rotational positions of each of the camshafts and the crankshaft. More<br>
specifically, a target wheel including a known number of teeth is fixed for rotation<br>
with each of the respective camshafts and crankshaft. An associated sensor<br>
detects the rising and falling edges of the teeth as they pass the sensor and the<br>
sensor generates a pulse-train based thereon. Each target wheel includes a gap<br>
(e.g., one or two teeth missing) and/or a wider or thinner tooth, each of which<br>
operates as a reference point to determine the rotational position of the<br>
respective camshafts and crankshaft.<br>
[0009] Because the crankshaft drives the camshafts via the timing<br>
sprockets and chain, and because the timing of the intake and exhaust valve<br>
movement influences the combustion process, engine systems traditionally<br>
monitor the relative rotational positions of the crankshaft position and the<br>
camshafts. This is achieved by monitoring the relative positions of the crankshaft<br>
pulse-train and the camshaft pulse-trains generated by the respective sensors. If<br>
the relative position of the crankshaft to the camshafts deviates by a certain<br>
degree, a diagnostic trouble code (DTC) is set indicating a fault with the timing<br>
(i.e., relative positions) of the camshafts relative to the crankshaft.<br>
[0010] Traditional camshaft to crankshaft timing diagnostics are not as<br>
robust as desired. More specifically, traditional diagnostics aren't as accurate as<br>
desired and can produce false faults (e.g., setting a DTC when no actual fault<br>
exists), or, in some cases, can fail to detect a fault (e.g., fail to set a DTC when a<br>
fault exists).<br><br>
SUMMARY<br>
[0011] Accordingly, the present disclosure provides a method of<br>
correlating a rotational position of a crankshaft to a rotational position of a<br>
camshaft. The method includes determining a stretch value of a timing<br>
connection, which drivingly couples the crankshaft and the camshaft, and<br>
calculating a crankshaft to camshaft rotational position value indicative of the<br>
rotational position of the crankshaft with respect to the rotational position of the<br>
camshaft. The crankshaft to camshaft rotational position value is compensated<br>
based on the stretch value to provide a compensated crankshaft to camshaft<br>
rotational position value and whether the rotational position of the crankshaft<br>
correlates to the rotational position of the camshaft is determined based on the<br>
compensated crankshaft to camshaft rotational position value.<br>
[0012] In one feature, the compensated crankshaft to camshaft<br>
rotational position value is compared to a threshold value. The rotational position<br>
of the crankshaft does not correlate to the rotational position of the camshaft<br>
when the compensated crankshaft to camshaft rotational position value is greater<br>
than the threshold value.<br>
[0013] In another feature, the method further includes monitoring<br>
respective rotational positions of the camshaft and another camshaft. The<br>
stretch value is determined based on the respective rotational positions of the<br>
camshaft and the other camshaft.<br><br>
[0014] In another feature, correlation between the rotational positions<br>
of the camshafts may be evaluated relative to a threshold before selectively<br>
performing the calculation of the stretch value.<br>
[0015] In another feature, the method further includes comparing the<br>
stretch value to a threshold value and indicating that the timing connection is<br>
excessively stretched when the stretch value exceeds the threshold value.<br>
[0016] In still another feature, the method further includes comparing<br>
the stretch value to a threshold value and indicating that the rotational position of<br>
the crankshaft does not correlate to the rotational position of the camshaft when<br>
the stretch value exceeds the threshold value.<br>
[0017] In yet another feature, the method further includes calculating a<br>
rotational misalignment value between the crankshaft and the camshaft based on<br>
the stretch value. The compensated crankshaft to camshaft rotational position<br>
value is determined based on the rotational misalignment value.<br>
[0018] Further areas of applicability will become apparent from the<br>
description provided herein. It should be understood that the description and<br>
specific examples are intended for purposes of illustration only and are not<br>
intended to limit the scope of the present disclosure.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0024] The following description is merely exemplary in nature and is in<br>
no way intended to limit the disclosure, its application, or uses. For purposes of<br>
clarity, the same reference numbers will be used in the drawings to identify<br>
similar elements. As used herein, the term module refers to an application<br>
specific integrated circuit (ASIC), an electronic circuit, a processor (shared,<br>
dedicated, or group) and memory that execute one or more software or firmware<br>
programs, a combinational logic circuit, or other suitable components that provide<br>
the described functionality.<br>
[0025] Referring now to Figure 1, an exemplary engine system 10<br>
includes an engine 12, an intake manifold 14 and an exhaust manifold 16. The<br>
engine 12 combusts an air and fuel mixture to generate drive torque. More<br>
specifically, air is drawn into the intake manifold 14 through a throttle 18.<br>
Although the exemplary engine system 10 includes a throttle 18, it is anticipated<br><br>
that the teachings of the present disclosure can be implemented in an engine<br>
system that does not include a throttle.<br>
[0026] The air is mixed with fuel to form a combustion mixture that is<br>
compressed by a piston (not shown) within cylinders 20. Although only two<br>
cylinders 20 are shown, it is appreciated that the teachings of the present<br>
disclosure can be implemented in engine systems having one or more cylinders<br>
20. The air, and in some cases the combustion mixture, travels into the cylinder<br>
20 through an intake port (not shown), which is selectively opened by an intake<br>
valve (not shown). Combustion of the combustion mixture is induced within the<br>
cylinder 20 (e.g., via a spark from a spark plug or the heat of compression). After<br>
the combustion event, the product gases are exhaust from the cylinder 20<br>
through an exhaust port (not shown), which is selectively opened by an exhaust<br>
valve (not shown). It is anticipated that the engine system 10 can include one or<br>
more intake ports and/or exhaust ports with respective intake and exhaust<br>
valves.<br>
[0027] With particular reference to Figures 1 and 2, the movement of<br>
the intake and exhaust valves is induced by respective intake and exhaust<br>
camshafts 22, 24, which are rotatably driven by the crankshaft 26 via a timing<br>
arrangement 28. More specifically, the crankshaft 26 includes a timing sprocket<br>
30 and the intake and exhaust camshafts include respective timing sprockets 32,<br>
34. A timing connection 36 drivingly interconnects the timing sprockets 30, 32,<br>
34. For example only, the timing connection 36 may include a timing chain. As<br><br>
can be appreciated, timing gears, a pulley and timing belt, and/or other drive<br>
mechanisms may also be used.<br>
[0028] The crankshaft 26 rotatably drives the intake and exhaust<br>
camshafts 22, 24 to open and close the intake and exhaust ports via the<br>
corresponding valves in accordance with a desired engine event timing. More<br>
specifically, the opening and closing of the intake and exhaust ports are timed<br>
with respect to the linear position of the piston within the cylinder 20 and the<br>
particular piston stroke.<br>
[0029] For example only, the intake port is opened as the piston leaves<br>
the top-dead-center (TDC) position at the beginning of the expansion stroke and<br>
travels towards the bottom-dead-center (BDC) position. The linear position of the<br>
piston within the cylinder 20 corresponds to a rotational position of the crankshaft<br>
26. Therefore, the rotational positions of the intake and exhaust camshafts 22,<br>
24 correspond to the rotational position of the crankshaft. In order to ensure<br>
proper operation of the engine system 10, the relative rotational position of the<br>
intake and exhaust camshafts 22, 24 with respect to the crankshaft position<br>
correspond to a desired relative rotational position. In this manner, the timing of<br>
the intake and exhaust events accurately correspond to the position of the piston<br>
within the cylinder 20.<br>
[0030] It is also anticipated that the engine system 10 can include<br>
intake and exhaust cam phasers 37, 39, shown in phantom. The cam phasers<br>
37, 39 adjust the angular position of the intake and exhaust camshafts 22, 24<br>
relative to the angular position of the crankshaft 26. In this manner, the opening<br><br>
and closing events of the intake and exhaust valves can be independently<br>
adjusted to achieve a desired engine operation.<br>
[0031] A control module 40 monitors the rotation of the intake and<br>
exhaust camshafts 22, 24 as well as of the crankshaft 26. Sensors 42, 44<br>
respectively monitor the rotational positions of each of the intake and exhaust<br>
camshafts 22, 24. A sensor 46 monitors the rotational position of the crankshaft<br>
26.<br>
[0032] More specifically, respective target wheels (not shown), each of<br>
which includes a known number of teeth, are fixed for rotation with each of the<br>
respective intake and exhaust camshafts 22, 24 and crankshaft 26. Each sensor<br>
42, 44, 46 detects the rising and falling edges of the teeth of its respective target<br>
wheel as they pass the sensor 42, 44, 46 and the sensor 42, 44, 46 generates a<br>
pulse-train based thereon. The pulse-trains are provided as signals to the control<br>
module 40. Each target wheel may include a gap (e.g., one or two teeth missing)<br>
and/or a wider/thinner tooth, each of which operates as a reference point to<br>
determine the rotational position of the respective intake and exhaust camshafts<br>
22, 24 and of the crankshaft 26.<br>
[0033] By comparing the pulse-trains corresponding to the intake and<br>
exhaust camshafts 22, 24 to that of the crankshaft 26, the control module 40 can<br>
determine whether the relative position between the crankshaft 26 and the<br>
respective intake and exhaust camshafts 22, 24 corresponds to a desired relative<br>
position. If not, the timing of the intake and exhaust events does not correspond<br>
to a desired timing and a diagnostic trouble code (DTC) is set.<br><br>
[0034] In some instances, the relative rotational positions between the<br>
intake and exhaust camshafts 22, 24 and the crankshaft 26 come out of proper<br>
alignment or correlation. For example, during engine operation, the timing<br>
connection 36 can slip or jump, as explained in further detail below. As another<br>
example, the timing connection 36 can be improperly assembled onto the timing<br>
sprockets 30, 32, 34 during original engine assembly and/or subsequent engine<br>
maintenance, resulting in an incorrect relative position between the crankshaft 26<br>
and the camshafts 22, 24 for the desired engine timing.<br>
[0035] Furthermore, the timing connection 26 tends to stretch over the<br>
lifetime of the engine system 10, which can compound the problem of<br>
determining whether the crankshaft 26 and camshafts 22, 24 are properly aligned<br>
with respect to one another. As other examples, part to part variations and<br>
temperature effects can also play a role in improper alignment.<br>
[0036] The valvetrain stretch compensation control of the present<br>
disclosure determines a stretch value (lstretch and/or lstretch%) in the timing<br>
connection and compensates for lstretch and/or lstretch% when determining whether<br>
the rotational positions of the individual camshafts properly correspond to that of<br>
the crankshaft. More specifically, the valvetrain stretch compensation control<br>
enables lstretch and/or lstretch% to be considered when executing a camshaft to<br>
crankshaft correlation diagnostic, which determines whether the actual camshaft<br>
and crankshaft positions correspond to the desired camshaft and crankshaft<br>
positions. The following discussion will be described in the context of lstretch%.<br><br>
however skilled artisans will appreciate that the disclosure can be readily<br>
adapted to lstretch as well.<br>
[0037] The valvetrain stretch compensation control monitors the<br>
crankshaft sensor signals to determine whether the camshaft positions<br>
correspond to relative desired camshaft positions. More specifically, the<br>
camshaft sensor signals are processed to provide respective camshaft rotational<br>
positions CAM1 and CAM2, which may be measured in degrees. The difference<br>
between CAM1 and CAM2 is determined and is provided as A. lstretch is<br>
subsequently determined based on Aa. lstretch can be determined based on the<br>
following exemplary relationship:<br><br>
where lstrech is the drive change between cam sprockets due to stretch. For<br>
example, in a chain drive system this is the chain length increase due to stretch<br>
(typically measured in millimeters). rtarget is the effective radius of the camshaft<br>
sensor target wheel.<br>
[0038] In the case that the timing connection is a chain, for example,<br>
target is provided as the radius of the target wheel at the bottom of the tooth plus<br>
the radius of the chain links. To convert lstretch to a percentage:<br><br>
where LN Cam Com is the nominal drive length between the camshafts without<br>
stretch.<br><br>
[0039] The valvetrain stretch compensation control compares lstretch% to<br>
first and second thresholds ITHR1 and ITHR2, respectively. ITHR1 corresponds to the<br>
camshaft positions being so out of alignment with one another that the timing<br>
connection must have been improperly assembled or the timing connection<br>
slipped during operation of the engine (i.e., in this case, lstretch% is so great that it<br>
is not indicative of an actual stretch of the timing connection). If lstretch% is greater<br>
than ITHR1, a so-called tooth-off DTC is set, which indicates that the alignment of<br>
the valvetrain is off by at least one tooth of the timing sprockets. ITHR1<br>
corresponds to an excessively stretched timing connection. If lstretch% is greater<br>
than ITHR2, an excessive stretch DTC is set. If lstretch% is not greater than either<br>
ITHRI or ITHR2. the timing connection is not sufficiently stretched to affect the<br>
camshaft to camshaft correlation, but is used when determining whether each of<br>
the camshaft positions correspond to the crankshaft position, as explained in.<br>
further detail below.<br>
[0040] If neither the tooth-off DTC nor the excessive stretch DTC is set<br>
during the camshaft to camshaft correlation, the valvetrain stretch compensation<br>
control determines a compensator (stretch) based on lstretch%- stretch indicates that<br>
amount of rotational misalignment between the crankshaft and each of the<br>
camshafts due to the stretch of the timing connection. astretch can be determined<br>
based on the following exemplary relationship:<br>
_ 1 °0 X *rtrelch% X Av J.am_Crank<br>
_<br><br>
where stretch is camshaft rotation (typically in degrees) with respect to crankshaft<br>
due to valvetrain stretch, LN Cam Cmk corresponds to the nominal drive length<br>
between the camshaft to the crankshaft without stretch, and stretch is calculated<br>
for each camshaft.<br>
[0041] In order to determine whether each of the camshaft positions<br>
correspond to the crankshaft position, the camshaft sensor signals and the<br>
crankshaft sensor signal are monitored. The camshaft sensor signals are<br>
processed to provide the respective camshaft rotational positions CAM1 and<br>
cAM2- Similarly, the crankshaft sensor signal is processed to provide the<br>
crankshaft rotational position CRANK- ICRANK is compared to each of CAM1 and<br>
CAM2 to provide  and -  and  are indicative of the rotational<br>
position of each camshaft with respect to the crankshaft.  and  are<br>
adjusted based on stretch to provide COMP1 and COMP2- Thus, COMP1 and<br>
MP2 compensate for lstretch% as follows: COMP1 =  - stretchi and COMP2<br>
= 2 - COMP2.<br>
[0042] COMP1 and COMP2 are compared to a threshold () to<br>
determine whether each camshaft is out of alignment with the crankshaft. More<br>
specifically, if either COMP2 and COMP2 is greater than , the tooth-off<br>
DTC is set, which indicates that the alignment of the valvetrain is off by at least<br>
one tooth of the timing sprockets. If neither COMP1 nor COMP2 is greater than<br>
THR. THE valvetrain is properly aligned. In this manner, the valvetrain stretch<br>
compensation control compensates the camshaft to crankshaft correlation for<br><br>
stretch in the timing connection, thereby improving the accuracy of the correlation<br>
and minimizing false setting of DTCs.<br>
[0043] It is anticipated that the valvetrain stretch compensation control<br>
can be implemented with engines having any number of timing connections<br>
and/or camshafts. For example, the valvetrain stretch compensation control can<br>
be implemented with an engine having a single timing connection that drivingly<br>
couples the crankshaft with two or more camshafts. Similarly, the valvetrain<br>
stretch compensation control can be implemented with an engine having two or<br>
more timing connections, each of which drivingly couples the crankshaft with two<br>
or more camshafts.<br>
[0044] Referring now to Figure 3, exemplary steps that are executed by<br>
the valvetrain stretch control will be described in detail. Step 302 begins control<br>
of the cam sensor signals. In step 304, control calculates Aa based on the cam<br>
sensor signals. As discussed above, any offset between the camshaft positions<br>
is considered when determining Aa. Control determines lstretch% based on Aa in<br>
step 306.<br>
[0045] In step 308, control determines whether lstretch% is greater than<br>
ITHRI • If lstretch% is greater than ITHRI, control sets the tooth-off (TO) DTC in step<br>
310 and control ends. If lstretch% is not greater than ITHRI, control determines<br>
whether lstretch% is greater than ITHR2 in step 312. If lstretch% is greater than ITHR2,<br>
control sets the excessive stretch DTC in step 314 and control ends. If lstretch% is<br>
not greater than ITHR2. control calculates stretch in step 316.<br><br>
[0046] Control monitors the camshaft and crankshaft sensor signals in<br>
steps 318. In step 320, control calculates Aa (e.g., , ) for each of the<br>
camshafts relative to the crankshaft based on the camshaft sensor signals and<br>
the crankshaft sensor signals. In step 322, control calculates COMP (e.g.,<br>
CoMP1. CoMP2) for each of the camshafts relative to the crankshaft based on<br>
the Aa values and stretch- Control determines whether each of the CoMP<br>
values, which correspond to each of the camshafts relative to the crankshaft, is<br>
greater than THR in step 324. If CoMP is greater than THR, control<br>
continues in step 310 and control ends. If CoMP is not greater than THR,<br>
control ends.<br>
[0047] Referring now to Figure 4, exemplary modules that execute the<br>
valvetrain compensation control will be discussed in detail. The exemplary<br>
modules include an lstretch% module 400, an stretch module 402, a Aa module 404,<br>
a CoMP module 406, a DTC module 408 and comparator modules 410, 412 and<br>
414, respectively. The lstretch% module 400 determines lstretch% based on the<br>
camshaft sensor signals. lstretch% is output to the stretch module 402 and the<br>
comparator modules 410, 412.<br>
[0048] The comparator module 410 compares lstretch% to ITHR1 and<br>
outputs a signal to the DTC module 408 based thereon. For example, if lstretch% is<br>
greater than ITHR1, the comparator module 410 outputs a "1" to the DTC module<br>
408. If lstretch% is not greater than ITHR1, the comparator module 410 outputs a "0"<br>
to the DTC module 408. Similarly, the comparator module 410 compares lstretch%<br>
to ITHR2 and outputs a signal to the DTC module 408 based thereon. The DTC<br><br>
module 408 selectively sets a DTC based on the signals from the comparators<br>
410,412.<br>
[0049] The stretch module 402 determines stretch based on lstretch%- The<br>
 module 404 determines  for each of the camshafts with respect to the<br>
crankshaft based on the camshaft sensor signals and the crankshaft sensor<br>
signal. The COMP module 406 determines COMP for each of the camshafts<br>
with respect to the crankshaft based on stretch and the Aa values output from the<br>
Aa module 404. The comparator module 414 compares COMP to THR and<br>
outputs a signal to the DTC module 408 based thereon. For example, if COMP<br>
is greater than THR, the comparator module 410 outputs a "1" to the DTC<br>
module 408. If COMP is not greater than THR, the comparator module 410<br>
outputs a "0" to the DTC module 408.<br>
