				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a method of treatment, in an autoclave, for<br>
conditioning and heat-setting textile products, more particularly yarns made of natural<br>
fibres such as wool or cotton or mixed natural and synthetic fibres. The invention<br>
also relates to an equipment for carrying out such a conditioning and heat-setting<br>
method.<br>
It is well-known that yarns wound on cones and bobbins, before being used in<br>
weaving looms or in circular knitting machines, must undergo a treatment to absorb a<br>
predetermined amount of humidity.<br>
Indeed, it is the presence of a correct humidity percentage inside the yarn that allows<br>
to stabilize its twist and avoid breakage when working on looms or knitting machines.<br>
Moreover, a correct dimensional yarn stabilization allows to increase the working-<br>
speed of the machinery as well.<br>
More particularly, in the synthetic mixed yarns the high temperature at which the<br>
treatment is carried out, heat-sets also the synthetic fibre.<br>
The yarn treatment allows also to condition the article by causing it to absorb the<br>
maximum water amount admitted by law, which is variable as a function of the kind of<br>
fibres, because the yarns are being sold at a price fixed with reference to a stated<br>
humidity content.<br>
Indeed, it is clear that if the yarn is sold with a humidity amount higher than the<br>
admitted one, the customer pays the product at a higher price relative to the agreed<br>
one.<br>
Conversely, if the yam is sold with a humidity content lower than the admitted one,<br>
the manufacturer is damaged because it supplies to the customer a yarn weight<br>
higher than the quantity paid for.<br>
The yarn treatment may be carried out in proper rooms where it remains for a rather<br>
long time that generally goes from 16 to 24 hours in a room kept at constant humidity.<br>
Such a method of treatment becomes obsolete in view of the required long time and<br>
is replaced by autoclave treatments with saturated steam having the advantage to be<br>
quicker and to allow the treatment repetitiveness.<br>
According to one of the known techniques, the yarn wound on cones or<br>
bobbins, is introduced into an autoclave by placing the cones or bobbins on<br>
support fixtures.<br>
The treatment cycle provides for an air-suction phase from the autoclave,<br>
followed by a heating phase in which inside the autoclave under vacuum, a<br>
water amount on its bottom is evaporated.<br>
More particularly, with reference to FIGs. 1 and 2 showing the development of<br>
temperature and pressure inside the autoclave respectively, a treatment cycle<br>
of the prior art provides for<br>
- a suction phase indicated by lines 1, during which at the same time of<br>
lowering pressure inside the autoclave from the ambient value Pa to the value<br>
P1, there is also a temperature decrease from the starting value Ti to the final<br>
value T1, in view of the endothermal nature of the evaporation process of<br>
water inside the autoclave;<br>
- a heating phase shown by lines 2, during which there is a temperature<br>
rise up to the value T2 and also a pressure rise up to the value P2 in view of<br>
the water evaporation inside the autoclave;<br>
- a stay time at temperature T2 and pressure P2 indicated by lines 3,<br>
during which the yarn absorbs humidity reaching the desired humidity<br>
condition;<br>
- restoration of the ambient pressure in the autoclave, indicated by lines<br>
4, allowing to return the autoclave and the material to the temperature and<br>
pressure conditions Ti and Pa respectively;<br>
- discharge of the treated material at point 5.<br>
The treatment time t is variable according to the users requirements and<br>
comprises:<br>
- a time interval t1 during which the suction phase causing vacuum<br>
inside the autoclave occurs (lines 1);<br>
- a time interval t2 required to heat the autoclave and produce the<br>
saturated steam (lines 2);<br>
- a time interval t3 allowing the yarn to absorb the humidity existing in<br>
the autoclave (lines 3);<br>
- a time interval t4 in which the starting pressure conditions are restored<br>
in the autoclave (lines 4).<br>
Thermal cycles of the described kind which are generally common to all the<br>
known treatments carried out in an autoclave, have the advantage to be much<br>
quicker in comparison with the previously described treatments.<br>
However, these cycles have also some drawbacks, of which the main one<br>
consists in the general impossibility to condition the yarn homogeneously,<br>
obtaining the same humidity conditions both outside and inside and in the<br>
middle of the cone or bobbin.<br>
Indeed, at the end of the treatment the distribution of humidity in the yarn is<br>
steadily decreasing from the outer surface to the interior of the cone or bobbin,<br>
in view of the difficulty met by the steam to reach and condense on the yarn<br>
replacing air in the inner zones near the tube or cone on which the yarn is<br>
wound.<br>
Modified thermal cycles are also known, in which the described cycle is<br>
followed by another similar cycle, generally indicated with 6 in FIGs. 1 and 2,<br>
allowing to obtain on the yarn a more homogeneous distribution of humidity<br>
between inside and outside the cone or bobbin.<br>
Such modified thermal cycles improve the uniform distribution of humidity,<br>
without obtaining, however, a perfectly homogeneous distribution. As a matter<br>
of fact even with a double treatment cycle it is not possible to substitute the<br>
humidity arising from condensation of saturated steam for the air present in the<br>
innermost and coldest zones of the bobbin or cone.<br>
A method of treatment for conditioning and heat-setting textile products as well<br>
as an equipment adapted to carry out such a method are also known from the<br>
PCT application having the publication number WO98/21390 and the<br>
corresponding US patent number 6094840.<br>
The cited method is an improvement relative to the previously described<br>
methods because it provides for removing hot water from the autoclave after<br>
each treatment cycle and collecting it in a recovery tank to be again used in the<br>
subsequent cycle so as to recover the heat contained therein.<br>
Such a method, however, has some acknowledged inconvenience, the main<br>
one being that after each vaporization cycle air coming from outside is<br>
introduced into the autoclave and enters again inside the material to be<br>
treated.<br>
It is clear that the air fraction entered inside the material dilutes the steam<br>
introduced inside the same material and at each subsequent cycle the same<br>
conditions arise again so as to make inefficient the increase of the number of<br>
consecutive treatment cycles.<br>
Moreover, pumps are used to transfer hot water from the autoclave to the<br>
recovery tank and vice versa.<br>
The present invention aims at overcoming the above drawbacks.<br>
More particularly, the object of the invention is to provide a method and an equipment<br>
for conditioning and heat-setting textile products that in comparison with equivalent<br>
treatment methods of the prior art, obtains a more homogeneous distribution of<br>
humidity between inside and outside of the product.<br>
More particularly, in case of yarns wound on cones or bobbins, the object is to obtain<br>
a more homogeneous distribution of humidity between inside and outside the cone or<br>
bobbin.<br>
Another object of the method and equipment of the invention is to obtain a lower air<br>
concentration and a better humidity distribution in the product under treatment in<br>
comparison with methods and equipments of the prior art carrying out the same<br>
number of cycles.<br>
A last, but not the least object is to obtain also a reduction of the treatment times with<br>
the method and equipment of the invention.<br>
To attain the foregoing objects, the present invention provides a method of treatment<br>
in an autoclave, for conditioning and heat-setting textile products, more particularly<br>
yarns wound in bobbins or cones, comprising the following steps : introducing the<br>
product to be treated into said autoclave ; closing said autoclave ; carrying out two or<br>
more thermal cycles, at least one of them comprising sequentially ; a transfer phase<br>
of water present in said autoclave inside a recovery tank ; a suction phase adapted to<br>
put said autoclave under vacuum ; a return phase of water present in said recovery<br>
tank inside said autoclave ; a heating phase of water contained in said autoclave to<br>
generate saturated steam ; a stay phase in said autoclave for a predetermined time<br>
of the conditions of temperature and pressure reached at the end of each of said<br>
heating phases ; restoring in said autoclave the ambient pressure at the end of the<br>
last of said stay phases ; opening said autoclave ; taking said treated product out<br>
from said autoclave, wherein each of said transfer phases of said water from said<br>
autoclave into said recovery tank and return of said water from said recovery tank into<br>
said autoclave, occurs spontaneously by suction produced by the difference of<br>
pressure existing between said autoclave and said recovery tank.<br>
This invention also provides an equipment adapted to carry out the method of<br>
treatment, wherein it comprises : an autoclave to contain the yarn to be treated ; a<br>
water recovery tank hydraulically connected with said autoclave ; a vacuum pump<br>
pneumatically connected with said autoclave and said water recovery tank.<br>
During said transfer and return phases, the interior of the autoclave does not<br>
communicate with the outside air and an atmosphere of saturated steam at a<br>
pressure lower than the atmospheric pressure is existing in the autoclave.<br>
Advantageously the method and the equipment of the invention allow to supply<br>
inside the cone or the bobbin, a greater quantity of saturated steam and<br>
consequently of humidity so as to replace almost totally the air present in the<br>
yarn.<br>
In a further advantageous way a more homogeneous distribution of humidity is<br>
obtained as well.<br>
Still advantageously, the treatment time of the method of the invention is also<br>
lower than the treatment time of the prior art methods thus allowing to carry out<br>
quicker cycles with lower costs.<br>
The foregoing objects and advantages will be better understood by the<br>
following description of a preferred embodiment of the method of the invention<br>
and of the equipment to carry out the method, which is given as an illustrative,<br>
but non-limiting example with reference to the accompanying sheets of<br>
drawings in which:<br>
FIGs. 1 and 2 show a cycle of thermal treatment of the prior art;<br>
FIGs. 3 and 4 show the treatment cycle of the present invention;<br>
FIGs. 5 to 7 show the equipment carrying out the treatment method of the<br>
invention in different operative phases.<br>
The treatment method of the invention is described with reference to the<br>
temperature-pressure diagrams shown in FIGs. 3 and 4 respectively and is<br>
carried out in an equipment generally indicated with 20 which is shown in FIGs.<br>
5 and 6 and comprises: an autoclave 21; a water recovery tank 22; a vacuum<br>
pump 23.<br>
The method and the equipment of the invention will be described hereinbelow<br>
when used for treating yarns; however, the same method and equipment may<br>
be used also to carry out the treatment of other textile products.<br>
As to the treatment method, it provides that the cones or bobbins of yarn to be<br>
treated are introduced into the autoclave 21 being arranged on suitable<br>
support fixtures allowing free circulation of steam amid cones or bobbins.<br>
Preferably, but not necessarily the thermal cycles are two and are<br>
indicated with C1 and C2 in FIGs. 3 and 4 where one can see that each cycle<br>
comprises a suction phase 10, 12 adapted to put the autoclave 21 under<br>
vacuum, followed by a heating phase 11, 13 of water contained in the<br>
autoclave to generate saturated steam.<br>
At the end of each heating phase there is a stay phase 35, 36 for a time tc, tp<br>
maintaining the attained conditions of temperature, humidity and pressure.<br>
More particularly, at the end of the stay phase 36 of the second cycle C2,<br>
before taking out the yarn treated in the autoclave 21, the ambient pressure Pa<br>
is restored.<br>
The first thermal cycle C1 comprises in detail the following phases in this<br>
order: a suction phase 10 adapted to put the autoclave 21 under vacuum<br>
without water inside it; an introduction phase 14 of water inside the autoclave<br>
21; a heating phase 11 of water inside the autoclave 21 to generate the<br>
saturated steam; a stay phase 35 maintaining the attained conditions of<br>
temperature and pressure; and the second thermal cycle C2 comprises the<br>
following phases in this order: a transfer phase 16 of water present inside the<br>
autoclave 21 to a recover tank 22; a suction phase 12 adapted to put the<br>
autoclave 21 under vacuum; a return phase 15 to the autoclave 21 of water<br>
present in the recovery tank 22; a heating phase 13 of water inside the<br>
autoclave 21 to generate the saturated steam; a stay phase 36 maintaining<br>
the attained conditions of temperature and pressure.<br>
According to the invention each transfer phase 16 of water from the autoclave<br>
21 to the recovery tank 22 and each return phase 14, 15 of said water from<br>
said recovery tank 22 to said autoclave 21, occurs spontaneously by suction<br>
produced by the pressure difference existing between said autoclave 21 and<br>
said recovery tank 22.<br>
Still according to the invention, during said phases of transfer 16 and return 14,<br>
15, the interior of the autoclave 21 does not communicate with the outside air<br>
and inside the autoclave there is an atmosphere of saturated steam at a lower<br>
pressure than the atmospheric one.<br>
Again with reference to the temperature-pressure diagrams of FIGs. 3 and 4,<br>
one can see that the second cycle C2 starts after a pre-set time tc from the<br>
stay phase 35 of the first cycle C1, during which the values of temperature T11<br>
and pressure P11 reached at the end of the heating phase 11, remain<br>
constant.<br>
Looking at the temperature pressure diagram of FIGs. 3 and 4 one can see<br>
that the temperature T10 reached inside the autoclave 21 at the end of the<br>
suction phase 10 of the first cycle C1, is lower than both the starting<br>
temperature Ti and the temperature T12 reached at the end of the suction phase 12<br>
of the second cycle C2.<br>
As to the pressure P10 reached inside the autoclave 21 at the end of the suction<br>
phase of the first cycle C1, it is higher than the pressure P12 reached at the end of<br>
the suction phase 12 of the second cycle C2, and both are lower than the ambient<br>
pressure Pa.<br>
As far as the heating phases are now concerned, the temperature T11 reached inside<br>
the autoclave 21 at the end of the heating phase 11 of the first cycle C1, is lower than<br>
the temperature T12 reached at the end of the heating phase 13 of the second cycle<br>
C2. Finally, pressure P11 reached inside the autoclave 21 at the end of the heating<br>
phase of the first cycle C1, is higher than the pressure P13 reached at the end of the<br>
heating phase 13 of the second cycle C2, and both are anyway lower than the<br>
ambient pressure Pa. Obviously, the values of temperature and vacuum that are<br>
obtained inside the autoclave 21 depend on the kind of yarn to be treated and the<br>
final features to be obtained.<br>
Again as a function of the kind of yarn to be treated and of the final features to be<br>
obtained, the times t10, t14, t16, t12, t13, tc, tp of the previously described<br>
corresponding treatment phases are selected. Thus one can see that the length of<br>
time t10 of the suction phase 10 of the first cycle C1 is greater than the length of the<br>
time t12 of the suction phase 12 of the second cycle C2. Moreover, one can see that<br>
also the length of time t11 of the heating phase 11 of the first cycle C1 is greater than<br>
the length of time t13 of the heating phase 13 of the second cycle C2.<br>
The method of the invention described by the temperature-pressure cycles shown in<br>
FIGs. 3 and 4 is carried out by the already mentioned equipment generally indicated<br>
with 20 and shown in FIGs. 5 to 7, comprising : an autoclave 21 ; a water-recovery<br>
tank 22 ; a vacuum pump 23, preferably, but not necessarily of the liquid loop kind.<br>
The autoclave 21, the tank 22 and the pump 23 are connected to each other through<br>
pipes provided with on/off valves.<br>
More particularly, the autoclave 21 is connected to the water recovery<br>
tank 22 through a water transfer pipe 24 which is intercepted by valve 24a and a<br>
water return pipe 28 intercepted by valve 28a.<br>
More particularly, one can see that the transfer pipe 24 and the return pipe 28<br>
are both connected to the autoclave 21 at a hydraulic seal 21a arranged on the<br>
bottom whose function is to allow transfer of water from the tank 22 to the<br>
autoclave 21 without admission of air inside the autoclave.<br>
As to the hydraulic seal 21a, it is of a kind known per se and generally consists<br>
of a pipe in which there is water acting as a diaphragm against entrance of air<br>
during the flow of water from the tank 22 to the autoclave 21.<br>
To this purpose one can see also that the return pipe 28, in order to avoid<br>
even more entrance of air into the autoclave 21 during transfer of water from<br>
the tank 22, is connected at the bottom of the tank 22, while the transfer pipe<br>
24 used to transfer water from autoclave to the tank 22, is connected at the<br>
tank top.<br>
Both the autoclave 21 and the tank 22 are connected to the vacuum pump 23<br>
through a first suction pipe 25 intercepted by a corresponding valve 25a and a<br>
second suction pipe 26 intercepted by a corresponding valve 26a, respectively.<br>
Finally, an auxiliary suction pipe 27 provided with a corresponding valve 27a,<br>
connects the first suction pipe 25 to the tank 22.<br>
Inside the autoclave 21 there are also thermal exchange means, not shown in<br>
the drawings, intended to heat water to produce the saturated steam.<br>
Operatively to carry out the treatment, the yarn to be treated is introduced into<br>
the autoclave 21 inside which there is no water.<br>
Any possibly present water is transferred through the transfer pipe 24 to<br>
the tank 22 where there is already water A shown in Figure 5.<br>
The yam inside the autoclave 21 is therefore at the starting temperature Ti<br>
indicated in Figure 3 and at the atmospheric pressure Pa indicated in Figure 4,<br>
corresponding to the starting point of the suction phase 10 of the first thermal<br>
cycle C1.<br>
Upon closure of the valves 24a, 28a, 26a and 27a, inside the autoclave 21,<br>
vacuum is generated through the vacuum pump 23 sucking air through the<br>
first suction pipe 25 upon opening the on/off valve 25a.<br>
During the suction phase inside the autoclave 21 the temperature and<br>
pressure conditions indicated by points T10 and P10 respectively are reached,<br>
where the temperature T10 is lower than the starting temperature Ti. Indeed,<br>
the steam expansion occurs with adiabatic cooling caused by the phase <br>
transition.<br>
At the end of the suction phase 10 and upon closure of the valve 25a, the valve 28a<br>
intercepting the water-return pipe 28 is opened, so that as shown in Figure 6, a portion<br>
Aa of the water A contained in the tank 22, passes spontaneously to the autoclave 21<br>
where it is sucked by the vacuum existing inside it. The temperature of the water<br>
coming from the tank 22 is higher than the temperature in the autoclave 21.<br>
One can see that water transfer from tank 22 to the autoclave 21 occurs spontaneously<br>
by suction and therefore without using pumps.<br>
Moreover, during the return phase of water from tank 22 to autoclave 21, the tank 22<br>
is put in communication with the outside while inside the autoclave 21 the atmosphere<br>
of saturated steam generated by vacuum is maintained.<br>
Indeed, the presence of the hydraulic seal 21a and the fact that withdrawal of water<br>
from tank 22 occurs at the lowest part of it, prevent entrance of air into the autoclave.<br>
In this way the material being treated does not lose the humidity previously acquired,<br>
as it happens on the contrary in the equipment described in the patent cited in the<br>
introductory part of the description.<br>
The water introduction phase 14 lasts for the time tl4. When water from tank 22<br>
reaches the autoclave 21, evaporation of a portion of water Aa occurs in the autoclave<br>
21 due to vacuum in the autoclave 21. As a result the pressure in the autoclave<br>
increases, while the temperature of the autoclave also increases, even if the<br>
temperature of the saturated steam inside the autoclave 21 is lower than the<br>
temperature of water present in the autoclave. On the other hand, if the temperature of<br>
water is higher than the temperature in the autoclave, an increase in pressure and<br>
temperature in the autoclave 21 can occur.<br>
Water inflow inside the autoclave ends at the points indicated with 30 in the diagrams<br>
of FIGs. 3 and 4 and corresponds with the condition of the equipment 20 shown in<br>
FIG. 6.<br>
Then it begins the heating phase 11 of the autoclave 21 carried out through the already<br>
mentioned heating means that could be for instance thermal exchange coils or other<br>
known systems.<br>
Heating lasts for the time t11 until the temperature and pressure conditions shown by<br>
points T11 and P11 in the diagrams of FIGs. 3 and 4 respectively are reached..<br>
During the heating phase there is also a further increase of pressure inside the<br>
autoclave because of the presence of saturated steam filling the autoclave chamber.<br>
The temperature and pressure conditions T11 and P11 are kept for a time tc to allow<br>
the saturated steam to penetrate into the yarn and condense in the innermost zones<br>
of the cone or bobbin, replacing the air inside them.<br>
Since the first cycle C1 alone is not sufficient to extract completely all the air<br>
present in the yarn, a second similar cycle C2 is carried out thereafter.<br>
More particularly, another transfer phase to the recovery tank 22 of water<br>
present in the autoclave 21 is carried out, shown in the diagrams of FIGs. 3<br>
and 4 where it is indicated by line 16. Such a transfer is carried out through the<br>
transfer pipe 24, upon opening of valve 24a, putting the tank 22 under vacuum<br>
through the second suction pipe 26 and upon opening the on/off valve 26a as<br>
shown in FIG. 7.<br>
In this way inside the tank 22 a pressure is created lower than the pressure<br>
existing inside the autoclave 21, thus taking water still present in the autoclave<br>
inside the tank 22.<br>
Therefore, one can see that also the transfer phase of water from autoclave 21<br>
to tank 22 occurs without using pumps as it happens in the prior art systems.<br>
Therefore, the same conditions of FIG. 5 occur in the yarn with all the water A<br>
contained in the tank 22.<br>
With reference to the diagrams, during such a phase there is a pressure<br>
decrease inside the autoclave and also a temperature decrease.<br>
The end of the phase of removing water from autoclave 21, indicated by point<br>
31 in the diagrams, is also the start of the suction phase 12 inside the<br>
autoclave 21 through the first suction pipe 25 upon closure of valve 24a and<br>
opening of valve 25a.<br>
At the end of the suction phase 12, inside the autoclave 21 there are the<br>
temperature and pressure conditions T12 and P12 respectively, with increase<br>
of vacuum in the autoclave relative to the vacuum reached at the end of the<br>
suction phase 10 of the first thermal cycle C1.<br>
Then water is introduced again into the autoclave 21 during the phase<br>
indicated by 15, occurring as already described in a quite similar way to the<br>
corresponding phase 14 of the first thermal cycle C1, that is by vacuum and<br>
through the return pipe 28, upon opening of the on/off valve 28a and closure of<br>
valve 25a.<br>
Therefore, in the equipment the situation shown in FIG. 6 occurs, where water<br>
transfer is terminated after a time t15 when reaching the point 32.<br>
A further heating of water present in the autoclave occurring in a time t13<br>
according to the phase indicated by line 13 in the diagrams, allows to reach the<br>
temperature and pressure conditions T13 and P13 respectively.<br>
Thereafter one can see a long stay phase of the temperature and pressure<br>
condition maintained for a time tp.<br>
During such time tp, the saturated steam penetrates further into the cone or<br>
bobbin and condensing at the inner colder zones, carries out a true flushing<br>
operation during which the condense water replaces the air molecules still<br>
present in the yarn.<br>
Practically one obtains the almost full replacement of still present air and<br>
therefore a humidification of the cone or bobbin inner zone with percentages of<br>
humidity equal to the values of the outer zone.<br>
By combining the two thermal cycles C1 and C2 a more homogeneous<br>
distribution of humidity between inside and outside of cone or bobbin is<br>
obtained.<br>
At the end of time tp inside the autoclave 21 the atmospheric pressure is<br>
restored and when reaching the temperature and pressure conditions indicated<br>
in the diagrams by the final point 33, the treated yarn is taken out.<br>
On the base of the foregoing one can therefore understand that the method of<br>
the invention and the equipment to carry out the method are attaining all the<br>
intended objects.<br>
More particularly, the spontaneous transfer by vacuum of water from autoclave<br>
21 to tank 22 and vice versa, allows to save use of pumps.<br>
Moreover, the presence of the hydraulic seal 21a in the autoclave 21 and the<br>
connection of the return pipe 28 at the bottom of tank 22, allow to transfer<br>
water avoiding the contemporaneous entrance of air into the autoclave,<br>
therefore without losing humidity by the materials under treatment and<br>
shortening the cycle time.<br>
It is clear that the values of temperature reached in the various<br>
treatment phases and the length of time of said phases will vary as a function<br>
of the kind of yarn and the heat-setting degree that one wants to obtain on it.<br>
Moreover, modifications could be made to the equipment for instance the<br>
vacuum pump may be of any type and more autoclaves and/or water recovery<br>
tanks may be provided.<br>
Said variations of method and equipment, when falling within the scope of the<br>
appended claims, are to be considered all covered by the present patent.<br>
