This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No.<br>
60/391,867, filed on June 24, 2002.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
[0001]	The present invention relates to a depot gel composition that can<br>
be injected into a desired location and which can provide controlled release of<br>
a beneficial agent over a short duration of time. The present invention also<br>
relates to a method of preparing and administering the composition.<br>
Description of the Related Art<br>
[0002]	Biodegradable polymers have been used for many years in<br>
medical applications. Illustrative devices composed of the biodegradable<br>
polymers include sutures, surgical clips, staples, implants, and drug delivery<br>
systems. The majority of these biodegradable polymers have been based<br>
upon glycolide, lactide, caprolactone, and copolymers thereof.<br>
[0003]	The biodegradable polymers can be thermoplastic materials,<br>
meaning that they can be heated and formed into various shapes such as<br>
fibers, clips, staples, pins, films, etc. Alternatively, they can be thermosetting<br>
materials formed by crosslinking reactions, which lead to high-molecular-weight<br>
materials that do not melt or form flowable liquids at high temperatures.<br>
Although thermoplastic and thermosetting biodegradable polymers have many<br>
useful biomedical applications, there are several important limitations to their<br>
use in the bodies of various animals including humans, animals, birds, fish, and<br>
reptiles.<br>
[0004]	Solid implant drug delivery systems containing a drug<br>
incorporated in thermoplastic or thermosetting biodegradable polymers have<br><br>
been widely used successfully. Such implants have to be inserted into the<br>
body through an incision which is sometimes larger than desired by the<br>
medical profession and occasionally lead to a reluctance of the patients to<br>
accept such an implant or drug delivery system. The following patents U.S.<br>
Patent Nos. 5,456,679; 5,336,057; 5,308,348; 5,279,608; 5,234,693;<br>
5,234,692; 5,209,746; 5,151,093; 5,137.727; 5,112,614; 5,085,866; 5,059,423;<br>
5,057,318; 4,865,845; 4,008,719; 3,987,790 and 3,797,492 are believed to be<br>
representative of such drug delivery systems and are incorporated herein by<br>
reference. These patents disclose reservoir devices, osmotic delivery devices<br>
and pulsatile delivery devices for delivering beneficial agents.<br>
[0005]	Injecting drug delivery systems as small particles, microspheres,<br>
or microcapsules avoids the incision needed to implant drug delivery systems.<br>
However, these materials do not always satisfy the demand for a<br>
biodegradable implant. These materials are particulate in nature, do not form a<br>
continuous film or solid implant with the structural integrity needed for certain<br>
prostheses, the particles tend to aggregate and thus their behavior is hard to<br>
predict. When inserted into certain body cavities such as a mouth, a<br>
periodontal pocket, the eye, or the vagina where there is considerable fluid<br>
flow, these small particles, microspheres, or microcapsules are poorly retained<br>
because of their small size and discontinuous nature. Further, if there are<br>
complications, removal of microcapsule or small-particle systems from the<br>
body without extensive surgical intervention is considerably more difficult than<br>
with solid implants. Additionally, manufacture, storage and injectability of<br>
microspheres or microcapsules prepared from these polymers and containing<br>
drugs for release into the body present problems.<br>
[0006]	The art has developed various drug delivery systems in response<br>
to the aforementioned challenges. The following patents U.S. Patent Nos.<br>
5,990,194; 5,780,044; 5,733,950; 5,620,700; 5,599,552; 5,556,905 5,278,201;<br>
5,242,910 and 4,938,763; and PCT publication WO 98/27962 are believed to<br>
be representative and are incorporated herein by reference. These patents<br><br>
disclose polymer compositions for injectable implants using solvents and/or<br>
plasticizers.<br>
[0007]	Previously described polymer compositions for injectable implants<br>
have used solvent/plasticizers that are very or relatively soluble in aqueous<br>
body fluids to promote rapid solidification of the polymer at the implant site and<br>
promote diffusion of drug from the implant. Rapid migration of water into such<br>
polymeric implants utilizing water soluble polymer solvents when the implants<br>
are placed in the body and exposed to aqueous body fluids presents a serious<br>
problem. The rapid water uptake often results in implants having pore<br>
structures that are non-homogeneous in size and shape. Typically, the surface<br>
pores take on a finger-like pore structure extending for as much as one-third of<br>
a millimeter or more from the implant surface into the implant, and such finger-<br>
like pores are open at the surface of the implant to the environment of use.<br>
The internal pores tend to be smaller and less accessible to the fluids present<br>
in the environment of use. The rapid water uptake characteristic often results<br>
in uncontrolled release of beneficial agent that is manifested by an initial, rapid<br>
release of beneficial agent from the polymer composition, corresponding to a<br>
"burst" of beneficial agent being released from the implant. The burst often<br>
results in a substantial portion of the beneficial agent, if not all, being released<br>
in a very short time, e.g., hours or 1-2 days. Such an effect can be<br>
unacceptable, particularly in those circumstances where a controlled delivery is<br>
desired, i.e., delivery of beneficial agent in a controlled manner over a period of<br>
greater than or equal to 3 days or up to a month, or where there is a narrow<br>
therapeutic window and release of excess beneficial agent can result in<br>
adverse consequences to the subject being treated, or where it is necessary to<br>
mimic the naturally-occurring daily profile of beneficial agents, such as<br>
hormones and the like, in the body of the subject being treated.<br>
[0008]	Accordingly, when such devices are implanted, the finger-like<br>
pores allow very rapid uptake of aqueous body fluids into the interior of the<br>
implant with consequent immediate and rapid dissolution of significant<br><br>
quantities of beneficial agent and unimpeded diffusion of beneficial agent into<br>
the environment of use, producing the burst effect discussed above.<br>
[0009]	Furthermore, rapid water uptake can result in premature polymer<br>
precipitation such that a hardened implant or one with a hardened skin is<br>
produced. The inner pores and much of the interior of the polymer containing<br>
beneficial agent are shut off from contact with the body fluids and a significant<br>
reduction in the release of beneficial agent can result over a not insignificant<br>
period of time ("lag time"). That lag time is undesirable from the standpoint of,<br>
presenting a controlled, sustained release of beneficial agent to the subject<br>
being treated. What one observes, then, is a burst of beneficial agent being<br>
released in a short time period immediately after implantation, a lag time in<br>
which no or very little beneficial agent is being released, and subsequently<br>
continued delivery of beneficial agent (assuming beneficial agent remains after<br>
the burst) until the supply of beneficial agent is exhausted.<br>
[00010]        Various approaches to control burst and modulate and stabilize<br>
the delivery of the beneficial agent have been described. The following patents<br>
U.S. Patent Nos. 6,130,200; 5,990,194; 5,780,044; 5,733,950; 5,656,297;<br>
5,654,010; 4,985,404 and 4,853,218 and PCT publication WO 98/27962 are<br>
believed to be representative and are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Notwithstanding some success, those methods have not been entirely<br>
satisfactory for the large number of beneficial agents that would be effectively<br>
delivered by implants.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
[00039]        The present Invention is directed to an injectable depot<br>
composition that serves as an implanted sustained release beneficial agent<br>
delivery system after injection into a patient's body. The composition is a gel<br>
formed from a low molecular weight bioerodible, biocompatible polymer; a<br>
solvent having a miscibility in Water of less than or equal to 7 wt.% at 25°C, in<br>
an amount effective to plasticize the polymer and form a gel therewith; and a<br>
beneficial agent dissolved or dispersed in the gel. The present invention is<br>
also directed to a method of systemicaliy or locally administering a beneficial<br>
agent to a subject by implanting in the subject an injectable depot composition<br>
as described above. By appropriate choice of solvent, water migration from the<br>
aqueous environment surrounding the implant system is restricted, and<br>
beneficial agent is released to the subject over a period of time, thus providing<br>
for delivery of the beneficial agent with a controlled burst of beneficial agent<br>
and sustained release thereafter. The duration and the rate of release of the<br>
beneficial agent are controlled by appropriate choice of the low molecular<br>
weight biodegradable polymer. The composition provides controlled sustained<br>
release of the beneficial agent by restricting water migration from the aqueous<br>
environment surrounding the implant system, thus delivering the beneficial<br>
agent over a short duration, preferably a period equal to or less than two<br>
weeks, preferably about 24 hours to about 2 weeks, preferably about 10 days<br>
or shorter; preferably about 7 days or shorter, more preferably about 3 days to<br>
about 7 days. Because the polymer of the composition is bioerodible, the<br>
implant system does not have to be surgically removed after beneficial agent is<br>
depleted from the implant.<br>
[00040]	Generally, the compositions of the invention are gel-like and form<br>
with a substantially homogeneous non-porous structure throughout the implant<br>
upon implantation and during drug delivery, even as it hardens. Furthermore,<br>
while the polymer gel implant will slowly harden when subjected to an aqueous<br>
environment, the hardened implant may maintain a rubbery (non-rigid)<br>
composition with the glass transition temperature Tg being below 37°C.<br><br>
[00041]        It has been discovered that when a solvent having a solubility in<br>
water of less than 7% by weight in water is present in the system, suitable burst<br>
control and sustained delivery of beneficial agent is achieved, whether or not a<br>
solubility modulator of the beneficial agent is present in the system. Typically,<br>
the implant systems useful in this invention will release, in the first 24 hours<br>
after implantation, 40% or less of the total amount of beneficial agent to be<br>
delivered to the subject from the implant system, preferably 30% or less and<br>
more preferably 20% or less. In certain embodiments, within 24 hours after   ,<br>
implantation the system releases less than or equal to 20% by weight of the<br>
amount of beneficial agent to be delivered over the duration of the delivery<br>
period, wherein the delivery period is 2 weeks. In additional embodiments,<br>
within 24 hours after implantation the system releases less than or equal to<br>
40% by weight of the amount of beneficial agent to be delivered over the<br>
duration of the delivery period, wherein the delivery period is one week. In<br>
additional embodiments, within 24 hours after implantation the system releases<br>
less than or equal to 50% by weight of the amount of beneficial agent to be<br>
delivered over the duration of the delivery period, wherein the delivery period is<br>
three days.<br>
[00042]        When the composition is intended for implantation by injection,<br>
the viscosity optionally may be modified by emulsifiers and/or thixotropic<br>
agents to obtain a gel composition having a viscosity low enough to permit<br>
passage of the gel composition through a needle. Also, pore formers and<br>
solubility modulators of the beneficial agent may be added to the implant<br>
systems to provide desired release profiles from the implant systems, along<br>
with typical pharmaceutical excipients and other additives that do not change<br>
the beneficial aspects of the present invention. The addition of a solubility<br>
modulator to the implant system may enable the use of a solvent having a<br>
solubility of 7% or greater in the implant system with minimal burst and<br>
sustained delivery under particular circumstances. However, it is presently<br>
preferred that the implant system utilize at least one solvent having a solubility<br>
in water of less than 7% by weight, whether the solvent is present alone or as<br><br>
part of a solvent mixture. It has also been discovered that when mixtures of<br>
solvents which include a solvent having 7% or less by weight solubility in water<br>
and one or more miscible solvents, optionally having greater solubility, are<br>
used, implant systems exhibiting limited water uptake and minimal burst and<br>
sustained delivery characteristics are obtained.<br>
Definitions<br>
[00043]	In describing and claiming the present invention, the following<br>
terminology will be used in accordance with the definitions set out below.<br>
[00044]        The singular forms "a," "an" and "the" include plural referents<br>
unless the context clearly dictates otherwise. Thus, for example, reference to<br>
"a solvent" includes a single solvent as well as a mixture of two or more<br>
different solvents, reference to "a beneficial agent" includes a single beneficial<br>
agent as well as two or more different beneficial agents in combination, and the<br>
like.<br>
[00045]        The term "beneficial agent" means an agent that effects a desired<br>
beneficial, often pharmacological, effect upon administration to a human or an<br>
animal, whether alone or in combination with other pharmaceutical excipients<br>
or inert ingredients.<br>
[00046]        As used herein, the term "polynucleotide" refers to a polymeric<br>
form of nucleotides of any length, either ribonucleotides or<br>
deoxyribonucleotides, and includes double- and single-stranded DNA and<br>
RNA. It also includes known types of modifications, substitutions, and<br>
intemucleotide modifications, which are known in the art.<br>
[00047]        As used herein, the term "recombinant polynucleotide" refers to a<br>
polynucleotide of genomic, cDNA, semisynthetic, or synthetic origin which, by<br>
virtue of its origin or manipulation: is not associated with all or a portion of a<br>
polynucleotide with which it is associated in nature; is linked to a polynucleotide<br>
other than that to which it is linked in nature; or does not occur in nature.<br><br>
[00048]        As used herein, the term "polypeptide" refers to a polymer of<br>
amino acids, inlcuding for example, peptides, oligopeptides, and proteins and<br>
derivatives, analogs and fragments thereof, as well as other modifications<br>
known in the art, both naturally occurring and non-naturally occurring.<br>
[00049]        As used herein, the term "purified" and "isolated" when referring<br>
to a polypeptide or nucleotide sequence means that the indicated molecule is<br>
. present in the substantial absence of other biological macromolecules of the<br>
same type. The term "purified" as used herein preferably means at least 75%<br>
by weight, more preferably at least 85% by weight, more preferably still at least<br>
95% by weight, and most preferably at least 98% by weight, of biological<br>
macromolecules of the same type present.<br>
[00050]        The term "AUC" means the area under the curve obtained from<br>
an in vivo assay in a subject by plotting blood plasma concentration of the<br>
beneficial agent in the subject against time, as measured from the time of<br>
implantation of the composition, to a time "t" after implantation. The time t will<br>
correspond to the delivery period of beneficial agent to a subject.<br>
[00051]	The term "burst index" means, with respect to a particular<br>
composition intended for systemic delivery of a beneficial agent, the quotient<br>
formed by dividing (i) the AUC calculated for the first time period after<br>
implantation of the composition into a subject divided by the number of hours in<br>
the first time period (ti), by (ii) the AUC calculated for the time period of<br>
delivery of beneficial agent, divided by the number of hours in the total duration<br>
of the delivery period (t2). For example the burst index at 24 hours is the<br>
quotient formed by dividing (i) the AUC calculated for the first twenty-four hours<br>
after implantation of the composition into a subject divided by the number 24,<br>
by (ii) the AUC calculated for the time period of delivery of beneficial agent,<br>
divided by the number of hours in the total duration of the delivery period.<br><br>
[00052]        The phrase "dissolved or dispersed" is intended to encompass all<br>
means of establishing a presence of beneficial agent in the gel composition<br>
and includes dissolution, dispersion, suspension and the like.<br>
[00053]        The term "systemic" means, with respect to delivery or<br>
administration of a beneficial agent to a subject, that the beneficial agent is<br>
detectable at a biologically-significant level in the blood plasma of the subject.<br>
[00054]        The term "local" means, with respect to delivery or administration<br>
of a beneficial agent to a subject, that the beneficial agent is delivered to a<br>
localized site in the subject but is not detectable at a biologically significant<br>
level in the blood plasma of the subject.<br>
[00055]        The terms "short period" or "short duration" are used<br>
interchangeably and refer to a period of time over which release of a beneficial<br>
agent from the depot gel composition of the invention occurs, which will<br>
generally be equal to or less than two weeks, preferably about 24 hours to<br>
about 2 weeks, preferably about 10 days or shorter; preferably about 7 days or<br>
shorter, more preferably about 3 days to about 7 days.<br>
[00056]        The term "gel vehicle" means the composition formed by mixture<br>
of the polymer and solvent in the absence of the beneficial agent.<br>
[00057]        The term "initial burst" means, with respect to a particular<br>
composition of this invention, the quotient obtained by dividing (i) the amount<br>
by weight of beneficial agent released from the composition in a predetermined<br>
initial period of time after implantation, by (ii) the total amount of beneficial<br>
agent that is to be delivered from an implanted composition. It is understood<br>
that the initial burst may vary depending on the shape and surface area of the<br>
implant. Accordingly, the percentages and burst indices associated with initial<br>
burst described herein are intended to apply to compositions tested in a form<br>
resulting from dispensing of the composition from a standard syringe.<br><br>
[00058]        The term "solubility modulator" means, with respect to the<br>
beneficial agent, an agent that will alter the solubility of the beneficial agent,<br>
with reference to polymer solvent or water, from the solubility of beneficial<br>
agent in the absence of the modulator. The modulator may enhance or retard<br>
the solubility of the beneficial agent in the solvent or water. However, in the<br>
case of beneficial agents that are highly water soluble, the solubility modulator<br>
will generally be an agent that will retard the solubility of the beneficial agent in<br>
water. The effects of solubility modulators of the beneficial agent may result<br>
from interaction of the solubility modulator with the solvent, or with the<br>
beneficial agent itself, such as by the formation of complexes, or with both. For<br>
the purposes hereof, when the solubility modulator is "associated" with the<br>
beneficial agent, all such interactions or formations as may occur are intended.<br>
Solubility modulators may be mixed with the beneficial agent prior to its<br>
combination with the viscous gel or may be added to the viscous gel prior to<br>
the addition of the beneficial agent, as appropriate.<br>
[00059]        The terms "subject" and "patient" mean, with respect to the<br>
administration of a composition of the invention, an animal or a human being.<br>
[00060]        Since all solvents, at least on a molecular level, will be soluble in<br>
water (i.e., miscible with water) to some very limited extent, the term<br>
"immiscible" as used herein means that 7% or less by weight, preferably 5% or<br>
less, of the solvent is soluble in or miscible with water. For the purposes of this<br>
disclosure, solubility values of solvent in water are considered to be determined<br>
at 25°C. Since it is generally recognized that solubility values as reported may<br>
not always be conducted at the same conditions, solubility limits recited herein<br>
as percent by weight miscible or soluble with water as part of a range or upper<br>
limit may not be absolute. For example, if the upper limit on solvent solubility in<br>
water is recited herein as "7% by weight," and no further limitations on the<br>
solvent are provided, the solvent "triacetin," which has a reported solubility in<br>
water of 7.17 grams in 100 ml of water, is considered to be included within the<br>
limit of 7%. A solubility limit in water of less than 7% by weight as used herein<br><br>
does not include the solvent triacetin or solvents having solubilities in water<br>
equal to or greater than triacetin.<br>
[00061]        The term "bioerodible" refers to a material that gradually<br>
decomposes, dissolves, hydrolyzes and/or erodes in situ. Generally, the<br>
"bioerodible" polymers herein are polymers that are hydrolyzable, and bioerode<br>
in situ primarily through hydrolysis.<br>
[00062]        The term "thixotropic" is used in its conventional sense to refer to<br>
a gel composition that can liquefy or at least exhibit a decrease in apparent<br>
viscosity upon application of mechanical force such as shear force. The extent<br>
of the reduction is in part a function of the shear rate of the gel when subjected<br>
to the shearing force. When the shearing force is removed, the viscosity of the<br>
thixotropic gel returns to a viscosity at or near that which it displayed prior to<br>
being subjected to the shearing force. Accordingly, a thixotropic gel may be<br>
subjected to a shearing force when injected from a syringe which temporarily<br>
reduces its viscosity during the injection process. When the injection process<br>
is completed, the shearing force is removed and the gel returns very near to its<br>
previous state.<br>
[00063]        A "thixotropic agent" as used herein is one that increases the<br>
thixotropy of the composition in which it is contained, promoting shear thinning<br>
and enabling use of reduced injection force.<br>
[00064]        The term "low molecular weight (LMW) polymer" refers to<br>
bioerodible polymers having a weight average molecular weight ranging from<br>
about 3000 to about 10,000; preferably from about 3000 to about 9,000; more<br>
preferably from about 4000 to about 8,000; and more preferably the low<br>
molecular weight polymer has a molecular weight of about 7000, about 6000,<br>
about 5000, about 4000 and about 3000 as determined by gel permeation<br>
chromatography (GPC).<br><br>
[00065]        The term "high molecular weight (HMW) polymer" refers to<br>
bioerodible polymers having a weight average molecular weight greater than<br>
10,000 as determined by gel permeation chromatography (GPC).<br>
[00066]        The polymer, solvent and other agents of the invention must be<br>
"biocompatible"; that is they must not cause irritation, inflammation or necrosis<br>
in the environment of use. The environment of use is a fluid environment and<br>
may comprise a subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravascular (high/low flow),<br>
intramyocardial, adventitial, intratumoral, or intracerebral portion, wound sites<br>
tight joint spaces or body cavity of a human or animal.<br>
[00067]        The following definitions apply to the molecular structures<br>
described herein:<br>
As used herein, the phrase "having the formula" or "having the structure" is not<br>
intended to be limiting and is used in the same way that the term "comprising"<br>
is commonly used.<br>
[00068]        The term "alkyl" as used herein refers to a saturated hydrocarbon<br>
group typically although not necessarily containing 1 to about 30 carbon atoms,<br>
such as methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, isobutyl, t-butyl, octyl, decyl,<br>
and the like, as well as cycloalkyl groups such as cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl and<br>
the like. Generally, although again not necessarily, alkyl groups herein contain<br>
1 to about 12 carbon atoms. The term "lower alkyl" intends an alkyl group of 1<br>
to 6 carbon atoms, preferably 1 to 4 carbon atoms. "Substituted alkyl" refers to<br>
alkyl substituted with one or more substituent groups, and the terms<br>
"heteroatom-containing alkyl" and "heteroalkyl" refer to alkyl in which at least<br>
one carbon atom is replaced with a heteroatom. If not otherwise indicated, the<br>
terms "alkyl" and "lower alkyl" include linear, branched, cyclic, unsubstituted,<br>
substituted, and/or heteroatom-containing alkyl or lower alkyl.<br>
[00069] The term "aryl" as used herein, and unless otherwise specified,<br>
refers to an aromatic substituent containing a single aromatic ring or multiple<br>
aromatic rings that are fused together, linked covalentty, or linked to a common<br><br>
group such as a methylene or ethylene moiety. Preferred aryl groups contain<br>
one aromatic ring or two fused or linked aromatic rings, e.g., phenyl, naphthyl,<br>
biphenyl, dlphenylether, diphenylamine, benzophenone, and the like, and most<br>
preferred aryl groups are monocyclic. "Substituted aryl" refers to an aryl moiety<br>
substituted with one or more substituent groups, and the terms "heteroatom-<br>
containing aryl" and "heteroaryl" refer to aryl in which at least one carbon atom<br>
is replaced with a heteroatom. Unless otherwise indicated, the term "aryl"<br>
includes heteroaryl, substituted aryl, and substituted heteroaryl groups.<br>
[00070]        The term "aralkyl" refers to an alkyl group substituted with an aryl<br>
group, wherein alkyi and aryl are as defined above. The term "heteroaralkyl"<br>
refers to an alkyl group substituted with a heteroaryl group. Unless otherwise<br>
indicated, the term "aralkyl" includes heteroaralkyl and substituted aralkyl<br>
groups as well as unsubstituted aralkyl groups. Generally, the term "aralkyl"<br>
herein refers to an aryl-substituted lower alkyl group, preferably a phenyl<br>
substituted lower alkyl group such as benzyl, phenethyl, 1-phenylpropyl, 2-<br>
phenylpropyl, and the like.<br>
[00071]        The term "heteroatom-containing" as in a "heteroatom-containing<br>
hydrocarbyl group" refers to a molecule or molecular fragment in which one or<br>
more carbon atoms is replaced with an atom other than carbon, e.g., nitrogen,<br>
oxygen, sulfur, phosphorus or silicon. Similarly, the term "heterocyclic" refers<br>
to a cyclic substituent that is heteroatom-containing, the term "heteroaryl"<br>
refers to an aryl substituent that is heteroatom-containing, and the like.<br>
[00072]	By "substituted" as in "substituted alkyl," "substituted aryl" and the<br>
like, as alluded to in some of the aforementioned definitions, is meant that in<br>
the alkyl or aryl moiety, respectively, at least one hydrogen atom bound to a<br>
carbon atom is replaced with one or more non-interfering substituents such as<br>
hydroxy!, alkoxy, thio, amino, halo, and the like.<br><br>
I. Injectable Depot Compositions:<br>
[00073]        As described previously, injectable depot compositions for<br>
delivery of beneficial agents over a short duration of time may be formed as<br>
viscous gels prior to injection of the depot into a subject. The viscous gel<br>
supports dispersed beneficial agent to provide appropriate delivery profiles,<br>
which include those having low initial burst, of the beneficial agent as the<br>
beneficial agent is released from the depot over time.<br>
[00074]        The polymer, solvent and other agents of the invention must be<br>
biocompatible; that is they must not cause irritation or necrosis in the<br>
environment of use. The environment of use is a fluid environment and may<br>
comprise a subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravascular (high/low flow),<br>
intramyocardial, adventitial, intratumoral, or intracerebral portion, wound sites,<br>
tight joint spaces or body cavity of a human or animal. In certain embodiments,<br>
the beneficial agent may be administered locally to avoid or minimize systemic<br>
side effects. Gels of the present invention containing a beneficial agent may<br>
be injected/implanted directly into or applied as a coating to the desired<br>
location, e.g., subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravascular, intramyocardial,<br>
adventitial, intratumoral, or intracerebral portion, wound sites, tight joint spaces<br>
or body cavity of a human or animal.<br>
[00075]	Typically, the viscous gel will be injected from a standard<br>
hypodermic syringe, a catheter or a trocar, that has been pre-filled with the<br>
beneficial agent-viscous gel composition as the depot. It is often preferred that<br>
injections take place using the smallest size needle (i.e., smallest diameter) or<br>
catheter to reduce discomfort to the subject when the injection is in a<br>
subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravascular (high/low flow), intramyocardial,<br>
adventitial, intratumoral, or intracerebral portion, wound sites, tight joint spaces<br>
or body cavity of a human or animal. It is desirable to be able to inject gels<br>
through a needle or a catheter ranging from 16 gauge and higher, preferably<br>
20 gauge and higher, more preferably 22 gauge and higher, even more<br>
preferably 24 gauge and higher. With highly viscous gels, i.e., gels having a<br>
viscosity of about 100 poise or greater, injection forces to dispense the gel from<br><br>
a syringe having a needle in the 20-30 gauge range may be so high as to make<br>
the injection difficult or reasonably impossible when done manually. At the<br>
same time, the high viscosity of the gei is desirable to maintain the integrity of<br>
the depot after injection and during the dispensing period and aiso facilitate<br>
desired suspension characteristics of the beneficial agent in the gel.<br>
[00076]        A composition of a polymer and polymer solvent that optionally<br>
includes an agent that imparts thixotropic characteristics to the viscous gel<br>
formed by the polymer solvent and polymer provides certain advantages. A<br>
thixotropic gel exhibits reduced viscosity when subjected to shear force. The<br>
extent of the reduction is in part a function of the shear rate of the gel when<br>
subjected to the shearing force. When the shearing force is removed, the<br>
viscosity of the thixotropic gel returns to a viscosity at or near that which it<br>
displayed prior to being subjected to the shearing force. Accordingly, a<br>
thixotropic gel may be subjected to a shearing force when injected from a<br>
syringe or a catheter, which temporarily reduces its viscosity during the<br>
injection process. When the injection process is completed, the shearing force<br>
is removed and the gel returns very near to its previous state.<br>
[00077]        Significant shear thinning properties of the injectable composition<br>
allow for a minimally invasive delivery, via a needle or a catheter, of a<br>
beneficial agent to various sites on an external and/or internal surface of the<br>
body. Further injection through the needle or injection catheter permits precise<br>
administration of a desirable amount of the composition at a desired location,<br>
with significant retention of the depot gel composition at the site of delivery<br>
while providing for sustained delivery of the beneficial agent from the site of<br>
administration. In certain embodiments, the injection catheter may include a<br>
metering device or an additional device to assist in the precise delivery of the<br>
composition.<br>
A. The Bioerodible, Biocompatible Polymen<br>
[00078]	Polymers that are useful in conjunction with the methods and<br>
compositions of the invention are bioerodible, i.e., they gradually degrade e.g.,<br><br>
enzymatically or hydrolyze, dissolve, physically erode, or otherwise disintegrate<br>
within the aqueous fluids of a patient's body. Generally, the polymers bioerode<br>
as a result of hydrolysis or physical erosion, although the primary bioerosion<br>
process is typically hydrolysis or enzymatic degradation.<br>
[00079]	Such polymers include, but are not limited to polylactides,<br>
polyglycolides, polyanhydrides, polyamines, polyesteramides, polyorthoesters,<br>
polydioxanones, polyacetals, polyketals, polycarbonates, polyorthocarbonates,<br>
polyphosphazenes, succinates, poly(malic acid), poly(amino acids),<br>
polyvinylpyrrolidone, polyethylene glycol, polyhydroxycellulose,<br>
polyphosphoesters, chitin, chitosan, hylauronic acid and copolymers,<br>
terpolymers and mixtures thereof.<br>
[00080]        The low molecular weight bioerodlble polymers have weight<br>
average molecular weight ranging from about 3000 to about 10,000; preferably<br>
from about 3000 to about 9,000; more preferably from about 4000 to about<br>
8,000; and more preferably the low molecular weight polymer has a molecular<br>
weight of about 7000, about 6000, about 5000, about 4000 and about 3000 as<br>
determined by gel permeation chromatography (GPC).<br>
Presently preferred polymers are polylactides, that is, a lactic acid-based<br>
polymer that can be based solely on lactic acid or can be a copolymer based<br>
on lactic acid and glycolic acid which may include small amounts of other<br>
comonomers that do not substantially affect the advantageous results which<br>
can be achieved in accordance with the present invention. As used herein, the<br>
term "lactic acid" includes the isomers L-lactic acid, D-lactic acid, DL-lactic acid<br>
and lactide while the term "glycolic acid" includes glycolide. Most preferred are<br>
poly(lactide-co-glycolide)copolymers, commonly referred to as PLGA. The<br>
polymer may have a monomer ratio of lactic acid/glycolic acid of from about<br>
100:0 to about 15:85, preferably from about 60:40 to about 75:25 and an<br>
especially useful copolymer has a monomer ratio of lactic acid/glycolic acid of<br>
about 50:50.<br><br>
[00081]        The lactic acid-based polymer has a weight average molecular<br>
weight ranging from about 3000 to about 10,000; preferably from about 3000 to<br>
about 9,000; more preferably from about 4000 to about 8,000; and more<br>
preferably the low molecular weight polymer has a molecular weight of about<br>
7000, about 6000, about 5000, about 4000 and about 3000 as determined by<br>
gel permeation chromatography (GPC). As indicated in aforementioned U.S.<br>
Patent No. 5,242,910, the polymer can be prepared in accordance with the<br>
teachings of U.S. Patent No. 4,443,340. Alternatively, the lactic acid-based<br>
polymer can be prepared directly from lactic acid or a mixture of lactic acid and<br>
glycolic acid (with or without a further comonomer) in accordance with the<br>
techniques set forth in U.S. Patent No. 5,310,865. The contents of all of these<br>
patents are incorporated by reference. Suitable lactic acid-based polymers are<br>
available commercially. For instance, 50:50 lactic acid.glycolic acid<br>
copolymers having weight average molecular weight ranging from about 3000<br>
to about 10,000; preferably from about 3000 to about 9,000; more preferably<br>
from about 4000 to about 8,000; and more preferably the low molecular weight<br>
polymer has a molecular weight of about 7000, about 6000, about 5000, about<br>
4000 and about 3000, and a wide variety of end groups to alter susceptibility to<br>
hydrolysis and subsequent breakdown of the polymer chain are available from<br>

[00084]        It has been surprisingly found that injectable depot gel<br>
formulations of the invention comprising low molecular weight polymers provide<br>
a controlled, sustained release of a beneficial agent over a short duration of<br>
time equal to or less than two weeks. The release rate profile can be<br>
controlled by the appropriate choice of a low molecular weight polymer, a water<br>
immiscible solvent, the polymer/solvent ratio, emulsifying agent, thixotropic<br>
agent, pore former, solubility modifier for the beneficial agent, an osmotic<br>
agent, and the like<br>
[00085]        The biocompatible polymer is present in the gel composition in an<br>
amount ranging from about 5 to about 90% by weight, preferably from about 10<br>
to about 85% by weight, preferably from about 15 to about 80% by weight,<br>
preferably from about 20 to about 75% by weight, preferably from about 30 to<br>
about 70% by weight and typically from about 35 to about 65%, and often<br>
about 40 to about 60% by weight of the viscous gel, the viscous gel comprising<br>
the combined amounts of the biocompatible polymer and the solvent. The<br>
solvent will be added to polymer in amounts described below, to provide<br>
injectable depot gel compositions.<br>
B. Solvents and Agents:<br>
[00086]        The injectable depot composition of the invention contains a<br>
water-immiscible solvent in addition to the bioerodible polymer and the<br>
beneficial agent. In preferred embodiments, the compositions described herein<br><br>
are also free of solvents having a miscibility in water that is greater than 7 wt.%<br>
at25°C.<br>
[00087]        The solvent must be biocompatible, should form a viscous gel<br>
with the polymer, and restrict water uptake into the implant. The solvent may<br>
be a single solvent or a mixture of solvents exhibiting the foregoing properties.<br>
The term "solvent", unless specifically indicated otherwise, means a single<br>
solvent or a mixture of solvents. Suitable solvents will substantially restrict the<br>
uptake of water by the implant and may be characterized as immiscible in<br>
water, i.e., having a solubility in water of less than 7% by weight. Preferably,<br>
the solvents are five weight percent or less soluble in water; more preferably<br>
three weight percent or less soluble in water; and even more preferably one<br>
weight percent or less soluble in water. Most preferably the solubility of the<br>
solvent in water is equal to or less than 0.5 weight percent.<br>
[00088]        Water miscibility may be determined experimentally as follows:<br>
Water (1-5 g) is placed in a tared clear container at a controlled temperature,<br>
about 20°C, and weighed, and a candidate solvent is added dropwise. The<br>
solution is swirled to observe phase separation. When the saturation point<br>
appears to be reached, as determined by observation of phase separation, the<br>
solution is allowed to stand overnight and is re-checked the following day. If<br>
the solution is still saturated, as determined by observation of phase<br>
separation, then the percent (w/w) of solvent added is determined. Otherwise<br>
more solvent is added and the process repeated. Solubility or miscibility is<br>
determined by dividing the total weight of solvent added by the final weight of<br>
the solvent/water mixture. When solvent mixtures are used, for example 20%<br>
triacetin and 80% benzyl benzoate, they are pre-mixed prior to adding to the<br>
water.<br>
[00089]        Solvents useful in this invention are generally less than 7% water<br>
soluble by weight as described above. Solvents having the above solubility<br>
parameter may be selected from aromatic alcohols, the lower alkyl and aralkyl<br>
esters of aryl acids such as benzoic acid, the phthalic acids, salicylic acid,<br><br>
lower alkyl esters of citric acid, such as Methyl citrate and tributyl citrate and<br>
the like, and aryl, aralkyl and lower alkyl ketones. Among preferred solvents<br>
are those having solubilities within the foregoing range selected from<br>
compounds having the following structural formulas (I), (II) and (III)<br>
The aromatic alcohol has the structural formula (I)<br><br>
wherein Ar is a substituted or unsubstituted aryl or heteroaryl group, n is<br>
zero or 1, and L is a linking moiety. Preferably, Ar is a monocyclic aryl or<br>
heteroaryl group, optionally substituted with one or more noninterfering<br>
substituents such as hydroxy!, alkoxy, thio, amino, halo, and the like. More<br>
preferably, Ar is an unsubstituted 5- or 6-membered aryl or heteroaryl group<br>
such as phenyl, cyciopentadienyl, pyridinyl, pyrimadinyl, pyrazinyl, pyrrolyl,<br>
pyrazolyl, imidazolyl, furanyl, thiophenyl, thiazolyl, isothiazolyl, or the like. The<br>
subscript "n" is zero or 1, meaning that the linking moiety L may or may not be<br>
present. Preferably, n is 1 and L is generally a lower alkylene linkage such as<br>
methylene or ethylene, wherein the linkage may include heteroatoms such as<br>
O, N or S. Most preferably, Ar is phenyl, n is 1, and L is methylene, such that<br>
the aromatic alcohol is benzyl alcohol.<br>
[00090]        The aromatic acid ester or ketone may be selected from the lower<br>
alkyl and aralkyl esters of aromatic adds, and aryl and aralkyl ketones.<br>
Generally, although not necessarily, the aromatic acid esters and ketones will<br>
respectively have the structural formula (II) or (III)<br><br>
[00091]	In the ester of formula (II), R1 is substituted or unsubstituted aryl,<br>
aralkyl, heteroaryl or heteroaralkyi, preferably substituted or unsubstituted aryl<br>
or heteroaryl, more preferably monocyclic or bicyclic aryl or heteroaryl<br><br>
optionally substituted with one or more non-interfering substituents such as<br>
hydroxyl, carboxyl, alkoxy, thio, amino, halo, and the like, still more preferably<br>
5- or 6-membered aryl or heteroaryl such as phenyl, cyclopentadienyl,<br>
pyridinyl, pyrimadlnyl, pyrazinyl, pyrrolyl, pyrazolyl, imidazolyl, furanyl,<br>
thiophenyl, thiazolyl, or isothiazolyl, and most preferably 5- or 6-membered<br>
aryl. R2 is hydrocarbyl or heteroatom-substituted hydrocarbyl, typically lower<br>
alkyl or substituted or unsubstituted aryl, aralkyl, heteroaryl or heteroaralkyl,<br>
preferably lower alkyl or substituted or unsubstituted aralkyl or heteroaralkyl,<br>
more preferably lower alkyl or monocyclic or bicydic aralkyl or heteroaralkyl<br>
optionally substituted with one 6r more non-interfering substituents such as<br>
hydroxyl, carboxyl, alkoxy, thio, amino, halo, and the like, still more preferably<br>
lower alkyl or 5- or 6-membered aralkyl or heteroaralkyl, and most preferably<br>
lower alkyl or 5- or 6-membered aryl optionally substituted with one or more<br>
additional ester groups having the structure -0-(CO)-R1. Most preferred esters<br>
are benzoic acid and phthalic acid derivatives.<br>
[00092]        In the ketone of formula (III), R3 and R4 may be selected from any<br>
of the R1 and R2 groups identified above.<br>
[00093]        Art recognized benzoic acid derivatives from which solvents<br>
having the requisite solubility may be selected include, without limitation: 1,4-<br>
cyclohexane dimethanol dibenzoate, diethylene glycol dibenzoate, dipropylene<br>
glycol dibenzoate, polypropylene glycol dibenzoate, propylene glycol<br>
dibenzoate, diethylene glycol benzoate and dipropylene glycol benzoate blend,<br>

dibenzoate, glyceryl tribenzoate, pentaerytthritol tetrabenzoate, cumylphenyl<br>
benzoate, trimethyl pentanediol dibenzoate.<br>
[00094]        Art recognized phthalic acid derivatives from which solvents<br>
having the requisite solubility may be selected include: Alkyl benzyl phthalate,<br>
bis-cumyl-phenyl isophthalate, dibutoxyethyl phthalate, dimethyl phthalate,<br>
dimethyl phthalate, diethyl phthalate, dibutyl phthalate, diisobutyl phthalate,<br>
butyl octyl phthalate, diisoheptyl phthalate, butyl octy\ phthalate, diisononyl<br><br>
phthalate, nonyl undecyl phthalate, dioctyl phthalate, di-isooctyl phthalate,<br>

phthalate, decyltridecyl phthalate, blend (50/50) of dioctyl and didecyl<br>
phthalates, butyl benzyl phthalate, and dicyclohexyl phthalate.<br>
[00095]        Many of the solvents useful in the invention are available<br>
commercially (Aldrich Chemicals, Sigma Chemicals) or may be prepared by<br>
conventional esterification of the respective arylalkanoic acids using acid<br>
halides, and optionally esterification catalysts, such as described in US Patent<br>
No. 5,556,905, which is incorporated herein by reference, and in the case of<br>
ketones, oxidation of their respective secondary alcohol precursors.<br>
[00096]        Preferred solvents include aromatic alcohols, the lower alkyl and<br>
aralkyl esters of the aryl acids described above. Representative acids are<br>
benzoic acid and the phthalic acids, such as phthalic acid, isophthalic acid, and<br>
terephathalic acid. Most preferred solvents are benzyl alcohol and derivatives<br>
of benzoic acid and include, but are not limited to, methyl benzoate, ethyl<br>
benzoate, n-propyl benzoate, isopropyl benzoate, butyl benzoate, isobutyl<br>
benzoate, sec-butyl benzoate, tert-butyl benzoate, isoamyl benzoate and<br>
benzyl benzoate, with benzyl benzoate being most especially preferred.<br>
[00097]        The composition may also include, in addition to the water-<br>
immiscible solvent(s), one or more additional miscible solvents ("component<br>
solvents"), provided that any such additional solvent is other than a lower<br>
alkanol. Component solvents compatible and miscible with the primary<br>
solvent(s) may have a higher miscibility with water and the resulting mixtures<br>
may still exhibit significant restriction of water uptake into the implant. Such<br>
mixtures will be referred to as "component solvent mixtures." Useful<br>
component solvent mixtures may exhibit solubilities in water greater than the<br>
primary solvents themselves, typically between 0.1 weight percent and up to<br><br>
and including 50 weight percent, preferably up to and including 30 weight<br>
percent, and most preferably up to an including 10 weight percent, without<br>
detrimentally affecting the restriction of water uptake exhibited by the implants<br>
of the invention.<br>
[00098]        Component solvents useful in component solvent mixtures are<br>
those solvents that are miscible with the primary solvent or solvent mixture, and<br>
include, but are not limited, to triacetin, diacetin, tributyrin, triethyl citrate,<br>
tributyl citrate, acetyl triethyl citrate, acetyl tributyl citrate, triethylglycerides,<br>
triethyl phosphate, diethyl phthalate, diethyl tartrate, mineral oil, polybutene,<br>
silicone fluid, glylcerin, ethylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, octanol, ethyl<br>
lactate, propylene glycol, propylene carbonate, ethylene carbonate,<br>
butyrolactone, ethylene oxide, propylene oxide, N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone, 2-<br>
pyrrolidone, glycerol formal, methyl acetate, ethyl acetate, methyl ethyl ketone,<br>
dimethylformamide, dimethyl sulfoxide, tetrahydrofuran, caprolactam,<br>
decylmethylsulfoxide, oleic acid, and 1-dodecylazacyclo-heptan-2-one, and<br>
mixtures thereof.<br>
[00099]	Preferred solvent mixtures are those in which benzyl benzoate is<br>
the primary solvent, and mixtures formed of benzyl benzoate and either<br>
triacetin, tributyl citrate, triethyl citrate or N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone. Preferred<br>
mixtures are those in which benzyl benzoate is present by weight in an amount<br>
of 50% or more, more preferably 60% or more and most preferably 80% or<br>
more of the total amount of solvent present. Especially preferred mixtures are<br>
those of 80/20 mixtures by weight of benzyl benzoate/triacetin and benzyl<br>
benzoate/N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone. In additional embodiments, the preferred<br>
solvent is benzyl alcohol, and mixtures formed of benzyl alcohol and either<br>
benzyl benzoate or ethyl benzoate. Preferred mixtures of benzyl<br>
alcohol/benzyl benzoate and benzyl alcohol/ethyl benzoate are 1/99 mixtures<br>
by weight; 20/80 mixtures by weight; 30/70 mixtures by weight; 50/50 mixtures<br>
by weight; 70/30 mixtures by weight; 80/20 mixtures by weight; 99/1 mixtures<br>
by weight. Especially preferred mixtures of benzyl alcohol/benzyl benzoate<br><br>
and benzyl alcohol/ethyl benzoate are 25/75 mixtures by weight and 75/25<br>
mixtures by weight.<br>
[000100]       In an especially preferred embodiment, the primary solvent is<br>
selected from an aromatic alcohol and lower alkyl and aralkyl esters of benzoic<br>
acid and the polymer is a lactic-acid based polymer, most preferably PLGA,<br>
having weight average molecular weight ranging from about 3000 to about<br>
10,000; preferably from about 3000 to about 9,000; more preferably from about<br>
4000 to about 8,000; and more preferably the low molecular weight polymer<br>
has a molecular weight of about 7000, about 6000, about 5000, about 4000<br>
and about 3000. Presently, the most preferred solvents are benzyl alcohol,<br>
benzyl benzoate and the lower alkyl esters of benzoic acid, e.g. ethyl benzoate.<br>
The primary solvents, e.g., aromatic alcohol and benzoic acid esters may be<br>
used alone or in a mixture with other miscible solvents, e.g., triacetin, as<br>
described herein.<br>
[000101]       The solvent or solvent mixture is capable of dissolving the<br>
polymer to form a viscous gel that can maintain particles of the beneficial agent<br>
dissolved or dispersed and isolated from the environment of use prior to<br>
release. The compositions of the present invention provide implants useful<br>
both for systemic and local administration of beneficial agent, the implants<br>
having a low burst index. Water uptake is controlled by the use of a solvent or<br>
component solvent mixture that solublizes or plasticizes the polymer but<br>
substantially restricts uptake of water into implant. Additionally, the preferred<br>
compositions may provide viscous gels that have a glass transition temperature<br>
that is less than 37°C, such that the gel remains non-rigid for a period of time<br>
after implantation of 24 hours or more.<br>
[000102]       The importance of restriction of water uptake and the appropriate<br>
choice of a low molecular weight polymer and a water immiscible solvent for a<br>
controlled, sustained delivery over a short duration can be appreciated by<br>
reference to Figures 1-10 illustrating in vivo release rate profiles for various<br>
compositions as a function of time.<br><br>
[000103]      The solvent or solvent mixture is typically present in an amount of<br>
from about 95 to about 10% by weight, preferably from about 80 to about 20%<br>
by weight, preferably about 75 to about 15% by weight, preferably from about<br>
70 to about 20% by weight, preferably about 65 to about 20% by weight,<br>
preferably about 65 to about 30% by weight and often about 60 to about 40%<br>
by weight of the viscous gel, i.e., the combined amounts of the polymer and the<br>
solvent. The polymer to solvent ratio ranges from about 30:70 to about 90:10<br>
by weight; preferably about 40:60 to about 80:20 by weight; preferably about<br>
50:50 to about 75:25 by weight; and more preferably about 55:45 to about<br>
65:35 by weight.<br>
[000104]       In addition to the control of water uptake and associated initial<br>
burst by choice of solvent, agents that modulate the water solubility of the<br>
beneficial agent can also be utilized in conjunction with the preferred solvents<br>
to control burst of beneficial agent from the implant. Burst indices and percent<br>
of beneficial agent released in the first twenty-four hours after implantation may<br>
be reduced by one-third to two-thirds or more by the use of solubility<br>
modulators associated with the beneficial agent. Such modulators are typically<br>
coatings, substances that form complexes or otherwise associate with or<br>
stabilize the beneficial agent such as metallic ions, other stabilizing agents,<br>
waxes, lipids, oils, non-polar emulsions, and the like. Use of such solubility<br>
modulators may permit the use of more highly water soluble solvents or<br>
mixtures and achieve burst indices of 8 or less for systemic applications, or<br>
with respect to local applications, release of beneficial agent in the first 24<br>
hours after implantation of not greater than 40% of the beneficial agent<br>
administered. Preferably that release will be not greater than 30% and more<br>
preferably not greater than 20%.<br>
[000105]       Limited water uptake by the compositions of this invention can<br>
often provide the opportunity to prepare compositions without solubility<br>
modulators when in other compositions such modulators would be necessary.<br><br>
[000106]       In instances where the choice of solvent and polymer result in<br>
compositions severely restricting water uptake by themselves, it may be<br>
desirable to add osmotic agents or other agents and hydroattractants that<br>
facilitate water uptake to desired levels. Such agents may be, for example,<br>
sugars and the like, and are well known in the art.<br>
[000107]      Limited water uptake by the solvent-polymer compositions of the<br>
present invention results in the implant compositions being formed without the<br>
finger-like pores in the surface of implants formed using prior art processes.<br>
Typically, a composition of the present invention takes the form of a<br>
substantially, homogeneous, sponge-like gel, with the pores in the interior of<br>
the implant being much the same as the pores on the surface of the implant.<br>
Compositions of the present invention retain their gel-like consistency and<br>
administer a beneficial agent in a controlled manner, at a sustained rate over a<br>
short duration of time than do prior art devices. This is possible with the<br>
appropriate choice of low molecular weight polymers and water immiscible<br>
solvents, and further since the injectable depot gel compositions of the present<br>
invention generally have a glass transition temperature, Tg, of less than body<br>
temperature of the subject, e.g. 37°C for humans. Because of the immiscibility<br>
of the solvents that are useful in this invention with water, water uptake by the<br>
implant is restricted and the pores that do form tend to resemble a closed cell<br>
structure without significant numbers of larger pores or pores extending from<br>
the surface into the interior of the implant being open at the surface of the<br>
implant. Furthermore, the surface pores offer only a limited opportunity for<br>
water from body fluids to enter the implant immediately after implantation, thus<br>
controlling the burst effect. Since the compositions often will be highly viscous<br>
prior to Implantation, when the composition is intended for implantation by<br>
injection, the viscosity optionally may be modified by the use of viscosity-<br>
reducing, miscible solvents or the use of emulsifiers, or by heating to obtain a<br>
gel composition having a viscosity or shear resistance low enough to permit<br>
passage of the gel composition through a needle.<br><br>
[000108]      The limit on the amount of beneficial agent released in the first 24<br>
hours that is either desired or required will depend on circumstances such as<br>
the overall duration of the delivery period, the therapeutic window for the<br>
beneficial agent, potential adverse consequences due to overdosing, cost of<br>
beneficial agent, and the type of effect desired, e.g., systemic or local.<br>
Preferably, 40% or less of the beneficial agent will be released in the first 24<br>
hours after implantation, where the percentage is based on the total amount of<br>
beneficial agent to be delivered over the duration of the delivery period.<br>
Typically, higher percentages of release in the first 24 hours can be tolerated if<br>
the duration of the delivery period is relatively short, e.g., a period equal to or<br>
less than two weeks, preferably about 10 days or shorter; preferably about 7<br>
days or shorter, more preferably about 3 days to about 7 days, or if the<br>
beneficial agent has a wide therapeutic window with little likelihood of side<br>
effects, or if the beneficial agent acts locally. In certain embodiments, within 24<br>
hours after implantation the system releases less than or equal to 20% by<br>
weight of the amount of beneficial agent to be delivered over the duration of<br>
the delivery period, wherein the delivery period is 2 weeks. In additional<br>
embodiments, within 24 hours after implantation the system releases less than<br>
or equal to 40% by weight of the amount of beneficial agent to be delivered<br>
over the duration of the delivery period, wherein the delivery period is one<br>
week. In additional embodiments, within 24 hours after implantation the<br>
system releases less than or equal to 50% by weight of the amount of<br>
beneficial agent to be delivered over the duration of the delivery period,<br>
wherein the delivery period is three days.<br>
[000109]      Depending on the particular solvent or solvent mixture selected,<br>
the polymer and beneficial agent, and optionally solubility modulators of the<br>
beneficial agent, the compositions of the present invention intended for<br>
systemic delivery may provide a gel composition having a burst index of 8 or<br>
less, preferably 6 or less, more preferably 4 or less and most preferably 2 or<br>
less. Compositions of PLGA weight average molecular weight ranging from<br>
about 3000 to about 10,000; preferably from about 3000 to about 9,000; more<br>
preferably from about 4000 to about 8,000; and more preferably the low<br><br>
molecular weight polymer has a molecular weight of about 7000, about 6000,<br>
about 5000, about 4000 and about 3000with solvents having a miscibility in<br>
water of less than 7% by weight, optionally combined with the other solvents,<br>
providing implants intended for systemic delivery of beneficial agent having a<br>
burst index of 10 or less, preferably 7 or less, more preferably 5 or less and<br>
most preferably 3 or less, are particularly advantageous. The use of solvent<br>
mixtures as discussed herein can be particularly advantageous as a means of<br>
providing sufficient plasticizing of the polymer to obtain viscous gel formation<br>
and at the same time meet the desired burst indices and percentage release^<br>
objectives of the compositions of the invention.<br>
[000110]       Compositions intended for local delivery of beneficial agent are<br>
formed in the same manner as those intended for systemic use. However,<br>
because local delivery of beneficial agent to a subject will not result in<br>
detectable plasma levels of beneficial agent, such systems have to be<br>
characterized by a percentage of beneficial agent released in a predetermined<br>
initial period, rather than a burst index as defined herein. Most typically, that<br>
period will be the first 24 hours after implantation and the percentage will be<br>
equal to the amount by weight of the beneficial agent released in the period<br>
(e.g. 24 hours) divided by the amount by weight of the beneficial agent<br>
intended to be delivered in the duration of the delivery period; multiplied by the<br>
number 100. Compositions of the present invention will have initial bursts of<br>
40% or less, preferably 30% or less, most preferably 20% or less, for most<br>
applications.<br>
[000111]       In many instances, it may be desirable to reduce the initial burst<br>
of beneficial agent during local administration to prevent adverse effects. For<br>
example, implants of the invention containing chemotherapeutic agents are<br>
suitable for direct injection into tumors. However, many chemotherapeutic<br>
agents may exhibit toxic side effects when administered systemically.<br>
Consequently, local administration into the tumor may be the treatment method<br>
of choice. It is necessary, however, to avoid administration of a large burst of<br>
the chemotherapeutic agent if it is possible that such agent would enter the<br><br>
vascular or lymphatic systems where it may exhibit side affects. Accordingly, in<br>
such Instances the implantable systems of the present invention having limited<br>
burst as described herein are advantageous.<br>
[000112]      The gel formed by mixing the polymer and the solvent typically<br>
exhibits a viscosity of from about 100 to about 50,000 poise, preferably from<br>
about 500 to about 30,000 poise, more preferably from about 500 to about<br>
10,000 poise measured at a 1.0 sec-1 shear rate and 25°C using a Haake<br>
Rheometer at about 1-2 days after mixing is completed. Mixing the polymer<br>
with the solvent can be achieved with conventional low shear equipment such<br>
as a Ross double planetary mixer for from about 10 minutes to about 1 hour,<br>
although shorter and longer periods may be chosen by one skilled in the art<br>
depending on the particular physical characteristics of the composition being<br>
prepared. Since the depot gel composition of the invention are administered<br>
as an injectable composition, a countervailing consideration when forming<br>
depot gel compositions that are viscous gels is that the polymer/solvent/<br>
beneficial agent composition have sufficiently low viscosity in order to permit it<br>
to be forced through a small diameter, e.g., 18-20 gauge needle. If necessary,<br>
adjustment of viscosity of the gel for injection can be accomplished with<br>
emulsifying agents or thixotropic agents as described herein. Yet, such<br>
compositions should have adequate dimensional stability so as to remain<br>
localized and be able to be removed if necessary. The particular gel or gel-like<br>
compositions of the present invention satisfy such requirements.<br>
[000113]       If the polymer composition is to be administered as an injectable<br>
gel, the level of polymer dissolution will need to be balanced with the resulting<br>
gel viscosity, to permit a reasonable force to dispense the viscous gel from a<br>
needle, and the potential burst effect. Highly viscous gels enable the beneficial<br>
agent to be delivered without exhibiting a significant burst effect, but may make<br>
it difficult to dispense the gel through a needle. In those instances, an<br>
emulsifying agent may optionally be added to the composition. Also, since the<br>
viscosity may generally be lowered as the temperature of the composition<br>
increases, it may be advantageous in certain applications to reduce the<br><br>
viscosity of the gel by heating to provide a more readily injectable composition.<br>
The shear thinning characteristics of the depot gel compositions of the present<br>
invention allow them to be readily injected into an animal including humans<br>
using standard gauge needles without requiring undue dispensing pressure.<br>
[000114]      When the emulsifying agent is mixed with the viscous gel formed<br>
from the polymer and the solvent using conventional static or mechanical<br>
mixing devices, such as an orifice mixer, the emulsifying agent forms a<br>
separate phase composed of dispersed droplets of microscopic size that<br>
typically have an average diameter of less than about 100 microns. The<br>
continuous phase is formed of the polymer and the solvent. The particles of<br>
the beneficial agent may be dissolved or dispersed in either the continuous<br>
phase or the droplet phase. In the resulting thixotropic composition, the<br>
droplets of emulsifying agent elongate in the direction of shear and<br>
substantially decrease the viscosity of the viscous gel formed from the polymer<br>
and the solvent. For instance, with a viscous gel having a viscosity of from<br>
about 5,000 to about 50,000 poise measured at 1.0 sec-1 at 25°C, one can<br>
obtain a reduction in viscosity to less than 100 poise when emulsified with a<br>
10% ethanol/water solution at 25° C as determined by Haake Rheometer.<br>
[000115]      When used, the emulsifying agent typically is present in an<br>
amount ranging from about 5 to about 80%, preferably from about 20 to about<br>
60% and often 30 to 50% by weight based on the amount of the injectable<br>
depot gel composition, that is the combined amounts of polymer, solvent,<br>
emulsifying agent and beneficial agent.   Emulsifying agents include, for<br>
example, solvents that are not fully miscible with the polymer solvent or solvent<br>
mixture. Illustrative emulsifying agents are water, alcohols, polyols, esters,<br>
carboxylic acids, ketones, aldehydes and mixtures thereof. Preferred<br>
emulsifying agents are alcohols, propylene glycol, ethylene glycol, glycerol,<br>
water, and solutions and mixtures thereof. Especially preferred are water,<br>
ethanol, and isopropyl alcohol and solutions and mixtures thereof. The type of<br>
emulsifying agent affects the size of the dispersed droplets. For instance,<br>
ethanol will provide droplets that have average diameters that can be on the<br><br>
order of ten times larger than the droplets obtained with an isotonic saline<br>
solution containing 0.9% by weight of sodium chloride at 21 °C.<br>
[000116]      The thixotropic agent, i.e. an agent that imparts thixotropic<br>
properties to the polymer gel, is selected from the lower alkanois. Lower<br>
alkanol means an alcohol that contains 2-6 carbon atoms and is straight chain<br>
or branched chain. Such alcohols may be exemplified by ethanol, isopropanol,<br>
and the like. Importantly, such a thixotropic agent is not a polymer solvent.<br>
(See e.g., Development of an in situ forming bidegradable poly-tactide-co-<br>
glycolide system for controlled release of proteins, Lambert, W.J., and Peck,<br>
K.D., Journal of Controlled Release, 33 (1995) 189-195). When used, the<br>
thixotropic agent may be present in amounts of 0.01 to 15 weight percent,<br>
preferably in amounts of 0.1 to 5 weight percent, and often in amounts of 0.5 to<br>
5 weight percent of the combined weight of the solvent and the thixotropic<br>
agent.<br>
[000117]       It is to be understood that the emulsifying agent and/or the<br>
thixotropic agent do not constitute a mere diluent or a polymer-solvent that<br>
reduces viscosity by simply decreasing the concentration of the components of<br>
the composition. The use of conventional diluents can reduce viscosity, but<br>
can also cause the burst effect mentioned previously when the diluted<br>
composition is injected. In contrast, the injectable depot composition of the<br>
present invention can be formulated to avoid the burst effect by selecting the<br>
appropriate low molecular weight polymer, the solvent and emulsifying agent<br>
so that once injected into place, the emulsifying agent has little impact on the<br>
release properties of the original system.<br>
[000118]      Although the injectable depot gel composition of the present<br>
invention preferably are formed as viscous gels, the means of administration of<br>
the implants is not limited to injection, although that mode of delivery may often<br>
be preferred. Where the injectable depot gel composition will be administered<br>
as a leave-behind product, it may be formed to fit into a body cavity existing<br>
after completion of surgery or it may be applied as a flowable gel by brushing<br><br>
or palleting the gel onto residual tissue or bone. Such applications may permit<br>
loading of beneficial agent in the gel above concentrations typically present<br>
with injectable compositions.<br>

substantially adversely affect the advantageous results that can be attained by<br>
the present invention. The beneficial agent may be any of the agents which<br>

[000124]       The present invention also finds application with<br>
chemotherapeutic agents for the local application of such agents to avoid or<br>
minimize systemic side effects. Gels of the present invention containing<br>
chemotherapeutic agents may be injected directly into the tumor tissue for<br>
sustained delivery of the chemotherapeutic agent over time. In some cases,<br>
particularly after resection of the tumor, the gel may be implanted directly into<br>
the resulting cavity or may be applied to the remaining tissue as a coating. In<br>
cases in which the gel is implanted after surgery, it is possible to utilize gels <br>
having higher viscosities since they do not have to pass through a small<br>
diameter needle. Representative chemotherapeutic agents that may be<br>
delivered in accordance with the practice of the present invention include, for<br>
example, carboplatin, cisplatin, paclitaxel, BCNU, vincristine, camptothecin,<br>
etopside, cytokines, ribozymes, interferons, oligonucleotides and<br>
oligonucleotide sequences that inhibit translation or transcription of tumor<br>
genes, functional derivatives of the foregoing, and generally known<br>
chemotherapeutic agents such as those described in U.S. Patent 5,651,986.<br>
The present application has particular utility in the sustained delivery of water<br>
soluble chemotherapeutic agents, such as for example cisplatin and<br>
carboplatin and the water soluble derivatives of paclitaxel. Those<br>
characteristics of the invention that minimize the burst effect are particularly<br>
advantageous in the administration of water soluble beneficial agents of all<br>
kinds, but particularly those compounds that are clinically useful and effective<br>
but may have adverse side effects.<br>
[000125]      To the extent not mentioned above, the beneficial agents<br>
described in aforementioned U.S. Patent No. 5,242,910 can also be used.<br>
One particular advantage of the present invention is that materials, such as<br>
proteins, as exemplified by the enzyme lysozyme, and cDNA, and DNA<br>
incorporated into vectors both viral and nonviral, which are difficult to<br>
microencapsulate or process into microspheres can be incorporated into the<br>
compositions of the present invention without the level of degradation caused<br><br>
by exposure to high temperatures and denaturing solvents often present in<br>
other processing techniques.<br>
[000126]      The beneficial agent is preferably incorporated into the viscous<br>
gel formed from the polymer and the solvent in the form of particles typically<br>
having an average particle size of from about 0.1 to about 250 microns,<br>
preferably from about 1 to about 200 microns and often from 30 to 125<br>
microns. For instance, particles having an average particle size of about 5<br>
microns have been produced by spray drying or freeze drying an aqueous<br>
mixture containing 50% sucrose and 50% chicken lysozyme (on a dry weight<br>
basis) and mixtures of 10-20% hGH and 15-30 mM zinc acetate. Such<br>
particles have been used in certain of the examples illustrated in the figures.<br>
Conventional lyophilization processes can also be utilized to form particles of<br>
beneficial agents of varying sizes using appropriate freezing and drying cycles.<br>
[000127]       To form a suspension or dispersion of particles of the beneficial<br>
agent in the viscous gel formed from the polymer and the solvent, any<br>
conventional low shear device can be used such as a Ross double planetary<br>
mixer at ambient conditions. In this manner, efficient distribution of the<br>
beneficial agent can be achieved substantially without degrading the beneficial<br>
agent.<br>
[000128]      The beneficial agent is typically dissolved or dispersed in the<br>
composition in an amount of from about 0.1% to about 50% by weight,<br>
preferably in an amount of from about 1% to about 40%, more preferably in an<br>
amount of about 2% to about 30%, and often 2 to 20% by weight of the<br>
combined amounts of the polymer, solvent, and beneficial agent. Depending<br>
on the amount of beneficial agent present in the composition, one can obtain<br>
different release profiles and burst indices. More specifically, for a given<br>
polymer and solvent, by adjusting the amounts of these components and the<br>
amount of the beneficial agent, one can obtain a release profile that depends<br>
more on the degradation of the polymer than the diffusion of the beneficial<br>
agent from the composition or vice versa. In this respect, at lower beneficial<br><br>
agent loading rates, one generally obtains a release profile reflecting<br>
degradation of the polymer wherein the release rate increases with time. At<br>
higher loading rates, one generally obtains a release profile caused by diffusion<br>
of the beneficial agent wherein the release rate decreases with time. At<br>
intermediate loading rates, one obtains combined release profiles so that if<br>
desired, a substantially constant release rate can be attained. In order to<br>
minimize burst, loading of beneficial agent on the order of 30% or less by<br>
weight of the overall gel composition, i.e., polymer, solvent and beneficial<br>
agent, is preferred, and loading of 20% or less is more preferred.<br>
[000129]       Release rates and loading of beneficial agent will be adjusted to<br>
provide for therapeutically-effective delivery of the beneficial agent over the<br>
intended sustained delivery period. Preferably, the beneficial agent will be<br>
present in the polymer gel at concentrations that are above the saturation<br>
concentration of beneficial agent in water to provide a drug reservoir from<br>
which the beneficial agent is dispensed. While the release rate of beneficial<br>
agent depends on the particular circumstances, such as the beneficial agent to<br>
be administered, release rates on the order of from about 0.1 to about 100<br>
micrograms/day, preferably from about 1 to about 10 micrograms per day, for<br>
periods of from about 3 to about two weeks can be obtained. Greater amounts<br>
may be delivered if delivery is to occur over shorter periods. Generally, higher<br>
release rate is possible if a greater burst can be tolerated. In instances where<br>
the gel composition is surgically implanted, or used as a "leave behind" depot<br>
when surgery to treat the disease state or another condition is concurrently<br>
conducted, it is possible to provide higher doses that would normally be<br>
administered if the implant was injected. Further, the dose of beneficial agent<br>
may be controlled by adjusting the volume of the gel implanted or the injectable<br>
gel injected.<br>
[000130]       Figures 1-9 illustrate representative release profiles of various<br>
beneficial agents obtained in rats from preferred compositions of this invention.<br>
As illustrated in the figures, the injectable depot gel formulations of the<br>
invention comprising low molecular weight polymers provide a controlled,<br><br>
sustained release of a beneficial agent over a short duration of time equal to or<br>
less than two weeks.<br>
Optional Additional Components:<br>
[000131]       Other components may be present in the injectable depot gel<br>
composition, to the extent they are desired or provide useful properties to the<br>
composition, such as polyethylene glycol, hydroscopic agents, stabilizing<br>
agents, pore forming agents, and others. When the composition includes a<br>
peptide or a protein that is soluble in or unstable in an aqueous environment, it<br>
may be highly desirable to include a solubility modulator, that may, for<br>
example, be a stabilizing agent, in the composition. Various modulating agents<br>
are described in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,654,010 and 5,656,297 which are<br>
incorporated herein by reference. In the case of hGH, for example, it is<br>
preferable to include ah amount of a salt of a divalent metal, preferably zinc.<br>
Examples of such modulators and stabilizing agents, which may form<br>
complexes with the beneficial agent or associate to provide the stabilizing or<br>
modulated release effect, include metal cations, preferably divalent, present in<br>
the composition as magnesium carbonate, zinc carbonate, calcium carbonate,<br>
magnesium acetate, magnesium sulfate, zinc acetate, zinc sulfate, zinc<br>
chloride, magnesium chloride, magnesium oxide, magnesium hydroxide, other<br>
antacids, and the like. The amounts of such agents used will depend on the<br>
nature of the complex formed, if any, or the nature of the association between<br>
the beneficial agent and the agent. Molar ratios of solubility modulator or<br>
stabilizing agent to beneficial agent of about 100:1 to 1:1, preferably 10:1 to<br>
1:1, typically can be utilized.<br>
[000132]       Pore forming agents include, biocompatible materials that when<br>
contacted with body fluids dissolve, disperse or degrade to create pores or<br>
channels in the polymer matrix. Typically, organic and non-organic materials<br>
that are water soluble such as sugars (e.g., sucrose, dextrose), water soluble<br>
salts (e.g., sodium chloride, sodium phosphate, potassium chloride, and<br>
sodium carbonate), water soluble solvents such as N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone and<br>
polyethylene glycol and water soluble polymers (e.g., carboxmethylcellulose,<br><br>
hydroxypropylcellulose, and the like) can conveniently be used as pore<br>
formers. Such materials may be present in amounts varying from about 0.1%<br>
to about 100% of the weight of the polymer, but will typically be less than 50%<br>
and more typically less than 10-20% of the weight of polymer.<br>
Utility and Administration:<br>
[000133]      The means of administration of the depot gel compositions is not<br>
limited to injection, although that mode of delivery may often be preferred.<br>
Where the depot gel composition will be administered as a leave-behind<br>
product, it may be formed to fit into a body cavity existing after completion of<br>
surgery or it may be applied as a flowable gel by brushing or palleting the gel<br>
onto residual tissue or bone. Such applications may permit loading of<br>
beneficial agent in the gel above concentrations typically present with<br>
injectable compositions.<br>
[000134]       Compositions of this invention without beneficial agent are useful<br>
for wound healing, bone repair and other structural support purposes.<br>
[000135]      To further understand the various aspects of the present<br>
invention, the results set forth in the previously described figures were obtained<br>
in accordance with the following examples.<br>
Example 1<br>
Depot gel preparation<br>
[000136]      A gel vehicle for use in an injectable depot of the composition<br>
was prepared as follows. A glass vessel was tared on a Mettler PJ3000 top<br>
loader balance. Poly (D,L-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA), available as 50:50 DL-<br>
PLG with an inherent viscosity of 0.15 (PLGA-BPI, Birmingham Polymers, Inc.,<br>
Birmingham, AL) and 50:50 Resomer® RG502 (PLGA RG 502), was weighed<br>
into the glass vessel. The glass vessel containing the polymer was tared and<br>
the corresponding solvent was added. Amounts expressed as percentages for<br>
various polymer/solvent combinations are set forth in Table 1, below. The<br>
polymer/solvent mixture was stirred at 250 ± 50 rpm (IKA electric stirrer, IKH-<br><br>
Werke GmbH and Co., Stanfen, Germany) for about 5-10 minutes, resulting in<br>
a sticky paste-like substance containing polymer particles. The vessel<br>
containing the polymer/solvent mixture was sealed and placed in a temperature<br>
, controlled incubator equilibrated to 37°C for 1 to 4 days, with intermittent<br>
stirring, depending on solvent and polymer type and solvent and polymer<br>
ratios. The polymer/solvent mixture was removed from the incubator when it<br>
appeared to be a clear amber homogeneous solution. Thereafter, the mixture<br>
was placed in an oven (65oC) for 30 minutes. It was noted that the PLGA was<br>
dissolved in the mixture upon removal from the oven.<br>

hGH Particle Preparation<br>
[000138]      Human growth hormone (hGH) particles (optionally containing<br>
zinc acetate) were prepared as follows: hGH solution (5 mg/ml) solution in<br>
water (BresaGen Corporation, Adelaide, Australia) was concentrated to 10<br>
mg/mL using a Concentration/ Dialysis Selector diafiltering apparatus. The<br>
diafiltered hGH solution was washed with 5 times volume of tris or phosphate<br>
buffer solution (pH 7.6). Particles of hGH were then formed by spray drying or<br>
lyophilization using conventional techniques. Phosphate buffer solutions (5*or<br>
50 mM) containing hGH (5 mg/mL) (and optionally various levels of zinc<br>
acetate (0 to 30 mM) when Zn complexed particles were prepared) were spray-<br>
dried using a Yamato Mini Spray dryer set at the following parameters:<br><br>
hGH particles having a size range between 2-100 microns were obtained.<br>
Lyophilized particles were prepared from tris buffer solutions (5 or 50 mM: pH<br>
7.6) containing hGH (5 mg/mL) using a Durastop µP Lyophilizer in accordance<br>
with the following freezing and drying cycles:<br><br><br>

Drug Loading<br>
[000143]      Particles comprising beneficial agent with or without stearic acid<br>
prepared as above were added to a gel vehicle in an amount of 10 - 30 % by<br>
weight and blended manually until the dry powder was wetted completely.<br>
Then, the milky light yellow particle/gel mixture was thoroughly blended by<br>
conventional mixing using a Caframo mechanical stirrer with an attached<br>
square-tip metal spatula. Resulting formulations are illustrated in Tables 1, 2<br>
and 3 below.<br><br><br><br>
[000144]      A representative number of implantable depots gel compositions<br>
were prepared in accordance with the foregoing procedures and tested for in<br>
vitro release of beneficial agent as a function of time and also in in vivo studies<br>
in rats to determine release of the beneficial agent as determined by blood<br>
plasma concentrations of beneficial agent as a function of time.<br>
Example 8<br>
Bupivacaine In Vivo Studies<br>
[000145]       In vivo studies in rats (4 or 5 per group) were performed following<br>
an open protocol to determine plasma levels of bupivacaine upon systemic<br>
administration of bupivicaine via the implant systems of this invention. Depot<br>
gel bupivacaine formulations were loaded into customized 0.5 cc disposable<br>
syringes. Disposable 18 gauge needles were attached to the syringes and<br><br>
were heated to 37° C using a circulator bath. Depot gel bupivacaine<br>
formulations were injected into rats and blood was drawn at specified time<br>
intervals (1 hour, 4 hours and on days 1,2, 5, 7, 9,14,21 and 28) and analyzed<br>
for bupivacaine using LC/MS.<br>
[000146]       Figures 1, 2 and 3 illustrate representative in vivo release profiles<br>
of bupivacaine hydrochloride and bupivacaine base obtained in rats from<br>
various depot formulation, including those of the present invention. The in vivo<br>
release profile of the depot formulations with low molecular weight PLGA   <br>
(formulations 2 and 4 in Figures 1, 2 and 3) exhibited short release duration for<br>
approximately 7 days, comparable to the control formulations (with higher<br>
molecular weight PLGA). Thus, the injectable depot gel formulations of the<br>
invention comprising low molecular weight polymers provide a controlled,<br>
sustained release of a beneficial agent over a short duration of time equal to or<br>
less than two weeks.<br>
Example 9<br>
hGH In Vivo Studies<br>
[000147]      In vivo hGH studies in rats were performed following an open<br>
protocol to determine serum levels of hGH upon systemic administration of<br>
hGH via the injectable depot gel compositions of this invention. Depot gel hGH<br>
formulations were loaded into customized 0.5 cc disposable syringes.<br>
Disposable 16 gauge needles were attached to the syringes and were heated<br>
to 37°C using a circulator bath. Depot gel hGH formulations were injected into<br>
immunosuppressed rats and blood was drawn at specified time intervals. All<br>
serum samples were stored at 4°C prior to analysis. Samples were analyzed<br>
for intact hGH content using a radio immuno assay (RIA).<br>
[000148]       Figures 4, 5 and 6 illustrate representative in vivo release profiles<br>
of human growth hormone ("hGH") obtained in rats from various depot<br>
formulation, including those of the present invention. The in vivo release<br>
profile of the depot formulations with low molecular weight PLGA (formulations<br>
6 and 7 in Figures 4, 5 and 6) exhibited short release duration for<br><br>
approximately 7-14 days, comparable to the control formulations (with higher<br>
molecular weight PLGA). Thus, the injectable depot gel formulations of the<br>
invention comprising low molecular weight polymers provide a controlled,<br>
sustained release of a beneficial agent over a short duration of time equal to or<br>
less than two weeks.<br>
Example 10<br>
In Vivo Studies on Bupivacaine depot formulation<br>
[000149]      As illustrated in. Table 3, various depot formulations can be made<br>
from the low molecular weight PLGA with either an ester end group or a<br>
carboxyl end group using different solvents such as benzyl benzoate (BB),<br>
benzyl alcohol (BA), ethyl benzoate (EB), mixtures of BB/Ethanol, BB/BA,<br>
BB/EB etc., with varying polymer/solvent ratios. The drug particles can be<br>
made either with or without hydrophobic excipients such as stearic acid (SA).<br>
[000150]       Figure 7 illustrates representative in vivo release profiles of<br>
bupivacaine obtained in rats from depot formulations made of low molecular<br>
weight PLGA in either BB or BA. Figure 8 illustrates representative in vivo<br>
release profiles of bupivacaine obtained in rats from depot formulations made<br>
of low molecular weight PLGA in BA with various polymer/solvent ratios. Figure<br>
9 illustrates representative in vivo release profiles of bupivacaine obtained in<br>
rats from depot formulations made of low molecular weight PLGA in BA with<br>
different end groups. Figure 10 illustrates representative in vivo release profiles<br>
of bupivacaine obtained in rats from depot formulations made of low molecular<br>
weight PLGA in BA with the drug particles formulated either with or without SA.<br>
[000151]       As illustrated in this example, by using low molecular weight<br>
PLGA either end-capped with an ester or carboxyl group, the short duration<br>
release of active agent from depot can be achieved. The formulations can be<br>
made in various solvents or solvent mixtures with various polymer/solvent<br>
ratios. The release profiles of the active agent from the depots can be varied.<br>
accordingly.<br><br>
Example 11<br>
Differential Scanning Calorimeter (DSC) measurements on PLGA polymers<br>
[000152]      The glass transition temperature of various low molecular PLGA<br>
polymers used in the present invention was determined using a differential<br>
scanning calorimeter (DSC) (Perkin Elmer Pyris 1, Shelton, CT). The DSC<br>
sample pan was tarred on a Mettler PJ3000 top loader balance. At least 20<br>
mg of polymer sample was placed in the pan. The weight of the sample was<br>
recorded. The DSC pan cover was positioned on to the pan and a presses was<br>
used to seal the pan. The temperature was scanned in 10°C increments from -<br>
50°C to 90°C.<br>
[000153]       Figures 11 and 12 illustrate the differences in the DSC diagrams<br>
of low molecular weight PLGA used in the formulations presented in this<br>
invention end-capped with either an ester group or the carboxyl terminated.<br>
These data demonstrate that the low molecular weight PLGA polymers used in<br>
this invention have a glass transition temperatures ("Tg") above 30 CC.<br>
Example 12<br>
In vitro degradation of PLGA polymers<br>
[000154]      The degradation profiles of low molecular weight PLGA polymers<br>
used in the present invention were performed in vitro at 37 °C in PBS buffer to<br>
determine the mass loss rate of the PLGA polymer as a function of time. Each<br>
of the copolymers comprised one sample set. Approximately 25 discs (100 + 5<br>
mg each) were pressed using a 13 mm stainless steel die. The sample was<br>
pressed with 10 tons of force for approximately 10 minutes using the Carver<br>
Press. The discs were kept in a glass vial in a vacuum oven at ambient<br>
temperature and 25 mm Hg until ready for use in the degradation bath. This<br>
procedure was repeated for each polymer tested. Phosphate buffered saline<br>
(PBS) solution (50 mM, pH 7.4) with sodium azide (0.1 N ) was prepared. One<br>
sample disc was weighed into the tarred vial and recorded as initial weight<br>
(Minitial). PBS (10 mL) was pipetted into each vial. The vial was capped<br>
securely and placed in a 37°C shaking water bath. The buffer was changed<br><br>
twice a week, prior to which the pH of the solution was recorded. At pro-<br>
designated time points, the samples were removed from the buffer bath, rinsed<br>
with de-ionized Milii-Q water, dried superficially, and weighed. The sample<br>
weight was recorded as wet weight (Mwet)- The sample was placed in a 10 mL<br>
lyophilization vial and placed in a freezer (-20°C) prior to lyophilization. After<br>
lyophilization, the samples were weighed again and recorded as dry weight<br>
(Mobilized) The percent mass loss was defined as {(Miyopwiized - Miai)/   x<br>
100%.<br>
[000155]       Figure 13 illustrates the mass loss profiles of the three PLGAs<br>
used in the formulations described above. From this it can be seen that each<br>
of the three polymers used has significantly different degradation rates. The<br>
low molecular weight PLGA with either an ester end group or carboxyl end<br>
group have a significantly faster degradation rate than the one with higher<br>
molecular weight. This represents more favorable towards short duration<br>
depots which prefers the polymer degrades as soon as the active agents are<br>
released from the depot. In accordance with various aspects of the present<br>
invention, one or more significant advantages can be obtained. More<br>
specifically, using simple processing steps, one can obtain a depot gel<br>
composition that can be injected into place in an animal without surgery using a<br>
low dispensing force through standard needles. Once in place, the<br>
composition will quickly return to its original viscosity and may exhibit rapid<br>
hardening so as to substantially avoid a burst effect and provide the desired<br>
beneficial agent release profile. Furthermore, once the beneficial agent has<br>
been fully administered, there is no need to remove the composition since it is<br>
fully biodegradable. As a still further advantage, the present invention avoids<br>
the use of microparticle or microcapsulation techniques which can degrade<br>
certain beneficial agents, like peptide and nucleic acid-based drugs and which<br>
microparticles and microcapsules maybe difficult to remove from the<br>
environment of use. Since the viscous gel is formed without the need for<br>
water, temperature extremes, or other solvents, suspended particles of<br>
beneficial agent remain dry and in their original configuration, which contributes<br><br>
to the stability of thereof. Further, since a mass is formed, the injectable depot<br>
gel composition may be retrieved from the environment of use if desired.<br>
[000156]      The above-described exemplary embodiments are intended to be<br>
illustrative in all respects, rather than restrictive, of the present invention. Thus<br>
the present invention is capable of many variations in detailed implementation<br>
that can be derived from the description contained herein by a person skilled in<br>
the art. All such variations and modifications are considered to be within the<br>
