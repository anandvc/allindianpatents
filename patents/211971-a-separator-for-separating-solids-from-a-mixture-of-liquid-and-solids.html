Separator for Separating Solid Matter from a Liquid-Solid Mixture Collected<br>
at a Dental Treatment Centre<br>
The present invention relates to a separator for separating solid matter from a liquid-solid mixture that has been suctioned from patients' mouths and collected at a dental treatment centre, said separator having a housing that incorporates an inlet for the mixture and an outlet for liquid, a solid material separation area being incorporated in said housing. The solid matter may contain drilling dust, fragments of bone, particles of amalgam that contain mercury, as well as particles of dental metals such as gold. It is mainly the mercury that for reasons of environmental protection is to be prevented from getting into the waste water.<br>
For this reason, for the past twenty years or so a large proportion of solid matter has been separated from the mixture.  In principle, there are three ways of doing this, namely by precipitating the heavier particles by gravity; precipitating them in centrifuge drums or the like, with active support from centrifugal force; and the retention of particles above a certain size by fdters, screens, and the like.<br>
Each of these three possibilities entails disadvantages: the retention of solid matter by filters and screens that are placed in the flow path of the mixture results in relatively rapid clogging of the filtering material or meshes; precipitation by gravity requires the slow and unperturbed passage of the mixture through the solid-matter separation chamber, which is difficult to achieve during<br><br>
dental activity since very variable quantities flow through, and separation by centrifuges requires costly equipment with drive motors, control systems, and the like.<br>
One objective of the present invention is to improve the gravity separation of solid matter from a dental mixture of liquid and solid material in a compact separator, when, for example, throughputs of 6 to S litres per minute can be processed.<br>
Another objective of the present invention is the additional separation of the suction air from the mixture of liquid-solid matter before said mixture enters the solid matter separator chamber, so that three-phase separation is provided.<br>
A further objective of the present invention is the separation of solid material from a mixture of suction air, liquid, and solid matter, when the suction air is first separated from the mixture o[ liquid and solid matter, then the solid material is precipitated out of the liquid by gravity, after which the suction air and the liquid that contains no solid matter are mixed together once again and delivered to the suction pump together.<br>
A further objective of the present invention is the additional separation of environmentally hazardous heavy-metal ions from the processed water that leaves the solid-material separation<br>
chamber.<br><br>
These and other objectives can be achieved with a separator according to the present invention, the solid material separation chamber of which has a first, lower sedimentation zone that is connected to the mixture inlet so as to permiit a flow between them, and at least one second<br>
sedimentation zone that is arranged above the first sedimentation zone, a free overflow beinii<br>
ii--	*—'<br>
formed at the flow end as an outlet for liquid. Because of the liquid overflow that is located abo\'e, at least a significant part of the solid material separation chamber is Hooded, so that the arrangement of at least two sedimentation zones one above the other ensures a sufficiently large sedimentation area in a small space, wherein good sedimentation conditions can exist even in the case of widely varying quantities flowing through them.<br>
in a first, preferred embodiment, provision is made such that there are at least two sedimentation pans arranged coaxially one above the other in the solid material separation chamber, each of these forming a sedimentation area of the second sedimentation zone.  In particular, the sedimentation pans are provided with non-aligned base openings and hollow cylinders that extend upward and surround these, and predetermine a sedimentation level.  Each of the off-set base openings effects a lateral defiection of the flow between the sedimentation pans; this extends the upward How path.<br>
In a second preferred embodiment, provision is made such that the second, upper sedimentation zone has at least two chanibers that are separated bv overflow ridges, each forming a sedimentation area, in the last of which there is a liquid outlet formed as a free overflow.<br><br>
The chambers that are separated by overflow ridges are formed in particular in an insert element that can be inserted into the sedimentation container: this element has two diametrically opposed base openings, the first base opening forming a flow connection from the first sedimentation zone that is located below; the fluid outlet being routed through the second base opening.<br>
In this embodiment, the solid material separation chamber is provided with a sedimentation container for solid material that can be connected, so as to provide a How, to an upper feed line and to a lower waste water channel, and from the tluid outlet in the last chamber a tube that can be connected to the waste water channel is routed downward through the sedimentation container. Here, too, at least a considerable part of the solid material separation chamber is flooded, and the flow is reversed.<br>
The liquid separator can also include a pre-scparation area with pans through which the flow passes from the top down in the manner of a cascade, and from which the mixture then flows through an annular inlet chamber outside the upper sedimentation zone, downward into the first lower sedimentation zone. The inlet chamber, which is narrow, makes a significant contribution to non-turbulence in the solid material separation chamber, since turbulence can hardly be transmitted from the inlet chamber into the interior of the sedimentation container.<br>
In one preferred embodiment, the annular inlet chamber is extended downward by a downfiow baftle so thai the reversal of flow is govemed by the lower edge of the downilow baffle.  The lower edge of the dowftlow baftle is not horizontal, but has a lowest area beneath the mixture<br><br>
inlet. The shape of the lower edge of the downflow baffle is so selected that the space between the mixture inlet and the edge is of almost equal size at each location. When separation begins a How will be established in which a vertical downward component away from the mixture inlet predominates until such time as the material that is forming the sediment itself blocks this preferred flow path. This lengthens the flow, and it increasingly receives a peripheral component alonu the downflow bafile.  Because of this, not only' is the height of the sedimentation raised to a level that is significantly higher than the lowest area of the downflow baffle, so that a very large capacity of the sedimentation container is achieved, and the sedimentation time is not only maintained, but is even prolonged.<br>
In another preferred embodiment of the present invention, the suction air that imparts the movement is separated from the mixture in an air separation chamber that is formed within the housing, above the sedimentation container, and in which the air is routed over guide surfaces and drawn off through an air outlet that is preferably provided in a pipe that is routed centrally downward in the housing.  In this embodiment, the liquid that is for all practical purposes free of environmentally hazardous material can pass not only into the waste water channel, but can also be returned to the suction air if, for example, a water ring pump that requires sealing liquid is used as the suction pump.  In this case, the liquid that has been processed can be drawn into the flow of air in an outlet chamber that is arranged beneath the sedimentation chamber, and then passed out of this.<br><br>
If the second sedimentation zone is provided into an insert element, this also has a base opening through which the pipe of the air outlet is led.<br>
Lamellar plates that rise in the direction of the in-flow can be pro\'ided within the annular inlet chamber into the first sedimentation zone, particularly if an air separation chamber is formed; the radial edges of these plates are arranged so as to be spaced above each other. This means that the inlet chamber is divided into a series of slits between the plates, and this slows down the mixture that is flowing in.<br>
In order to remove dissolve mercury compounds from the liquid, provision can be made such that an insert and/or filling that binds mercury or mercury ions, for example activated charcoal, can be provided in the second sedimentation zone.<br>
The present invention will be described in greater detail below on the basis of the drawings appended hereto, without being restricted thereto. The drawings show the following;<br>

Figure 1 shows a separator that is used to separate solid material from a liquid, the mixture that is suctioned off from a patient's mouth by a suction device 62 (Figure 3) being separated from the suction air in a preceding air separator, and then being carried off through a pressure lock, a valve, or the like from the vacuum stage of a dental suction system. Thus, the separator is at normal atmospheric pressure and the mixture passes through the mixture inlet 4 into the housing 1, within the mixture inlet area of which there is a central annular wall 33, beneath which the outlet 24 for the liquid that has been cleansed of solid matter is provided and which screens the liquid outlet 24 from the mixture inlet area.<br>
Beneath the mixture inlet area, the housing 1 encloses a solid material separation chamber 12 with a sedimentation container 13, in which the solid materia! is separated from the liquid in two sedimentation zones 22, 36. Above the sedimentation container 13 there is a pre-separation area, mainly for coarser and heavier particles, in which there are pans 27 through which the mixture flows from top to bottom. These pans incorporate an inclined bottom 28 and, in particular, three annular ridges 29 so that each in each instance three cascade-like concentric precipitation chambers are formed, one after the other.<br><br>
The bottom 28 of the upper of the two pans 27 is inclined inward and incorporates a central opening 30 that leaves the passage to the second pan 27 that is located beneath the first pan unobstructed, and through which the annular wall 33 extends from the central area of the second pan 27. The second pan 27 has a bottom 28 that is inclined outward, and there are also three annular ridges 29 on this; these also form concentric, cascade-like, sequential precipitation chambers. Liquid and solid matter flow over the outer edge of the second pan 27 down into a narrow mixture delivery channel 21 formed by a narrow annular chamber 50 to the first, lower sedimentation zone 22 that is provided in the lower area of the sedimentation container 13; a closed drain opening (not shown herein) can be pro\ided at the lowest point of the inclined housing bottom 2, The mixture delivery channel 21 is defined to the outside by the housing wall and to the inside by the outer defining walls of a plurality of sedimentation pans 14 that arc arranged coaxially one above the other to form a tube, and these form a second sedimentation zone 36. The sedimentation container 13 is always full of liquid during operation, since the liquid outlet 24 from the second sedimentation zone 36 is provided above the uppermost sedimentation pan 14 as a free overflow on the vertical drain tube 25, the upper end of which extends-in Figure 1 -beyond the uppermost sedimentation pan 24. At the lower end of the tube fomied by the defining walls 20 of the sedimentation pans 14, the How of liquid is deflected inwards and upwards, when it is mainly fine and very fine particles of solid material are carried along, and these then precipitate out in the sedimentation pans 14 through which the How moves upv\ards from below.<br><br>
Each of the sedimentation pans 14 has a bottom 15 in which there is a pluraHty of openings that are surrounded by hollow cylinders 16 that extend upwards and by truncated hollow conical stubs 17 that extend downward. The upper sides of the hollow cylinders 16 define the maximal sedimentation level in each sedimentation pan 14. The outer defining wall 20 of each sedimentation pan 14 also extends downward, so that a free space 18 is left between the top side of the hollow cylinders 16 and the underside of the bottom 15 of the sedimentation that is arranged above it. The truncated hollow conical stubs extend into this space.  In addition, the sedimentation pans 14 also incorporate inner defining walls that surround a central opening and through which the drain tube 25 for the liquid extends downward, and with which a lower housing outlet 26 is associated. The hollow cylinders 16 and the hollow truncated cones 17 are each arranged in rows that extend radially, a short row being inserted between each two rows that end at a greater distance from the outer defining wall 20, these short rows beginning at the outer end and ending at the approximately half the radius of the pan.<br>
In order to permit the best possible precipitation of even very fine particles in the sedimentation pans 14, the openings in the bottom 15 of the sedimentation pans 14 are not aligned, which is to say they do not form continuous flow channels; rather, the liquid emerging from the hollow cylinders 16 must be divertedlaterally within the free space 18 into at least one of the adjacent hollow truncated cones 17.<br>
As can be seen in Figure 4 and Figure 5, the outer defining walls 20 of the sedimentation pans 14 are pro\ided with three snap tabs 31 and corresponding snap recesses 32 so that they can be fitted<br><br>
together one above the other and locked into position. The recesses 32 are not positioned centrally between the snap tabs 31, so that when the sedimentation pans 14 are positioned one aho\e the other thev are offset not bv 60°, but-viewed in the direction indicated bv the arrow in<br>
i<br>
Figure 4-by less than 60° relative to each other.<br>
In the embodiment sliown in Figure 4 and Figure 5 , the rows IS each comprise five hollow cylinders 16, and the rows subtend an angle of 20° with each other. Centrally between two rows of five hollow cylinders 16 and truncated hollow cones 17 there is a row of three hollow cylinders 16 and truncated hollow cones 17. Rotating the uppermost sedimentation pans 14 by 20°, 40°, and 60° thus aligns the rows and the openings line up with each other. Rotation through 10°, 30°, and 50° places a row of five hollow cylinders/hollow truncated cones and a row with three hollow cylinders/hollow truncated cones above each other, when the hollow cylinders 16 of the lower sedimentation pansl4 are offset relative to the hollow truncated cones 17 of the upper sedimentation pans 14 only in a radial direction.<br>
In contrast to the foregoing, in the longitudinal cross sections in Figure 1 to Figure 3, the arrangements of the hollow cylinders/hollow truncated cones coincide only in every fourth sedimentation pan 14. as can be seen in the cross sections through the lowest and the uppermost (fifth) sedimentation pan 14. This arrangement results if the angle of 120° between the two adjacent snap tabs is di\ided in the ratio of 55° and 65° so that coincidence is achieved only after the tourth sedimentation pan. since only then does the angle of 4 x 55°= 220°, or 4 x 65° = 260° reprosenl an integer multiple of the angle of 20° between two rows of hollow cylinders, hollow<br><br>
1<br>
truncated cones 16, 17. (In each instance, all angle data relate to the intended radial centre plane of the snap tabs 31, snap recesses 32, hollow cylinders 16. and truncated hollow cones 17).<br>
Figure 4 shows the cross section lines A, B. C, D, and E of the five, assembled sedimentation pans 14 as in Figures 1 to 3.<br>
It is preferred that the uppermost sedimentation pan 14, which is to say the last-as viewed in the direction of flow-beforc the liquid outlet 24, contain a filling 19 than binds dissolved mercury ions and/or very finely dispersed elementary mercury or mercury vapour. This filling can be in the form of metal fibres, a metal mesh, a metal foam, etc., of a mercury alloying or metal (iron, zinc, tin, magnesium, copper, etc) that is a base in relation to mercury. An ion-cxchangc filling, for example thiourea, thiourea, or a similar ion-exchange material, can be used to remove mercury ions.The filling 19 can also contain activated charcoal.<br>
In the embodiment that is shown in Figure 2, the housing 1 also contains an air separation chamber 5 that is located above the solid material separation chamber 12, so that the suction air that carries the mixture into the separator housing 1 by way of the line 63 (Figure 3) is separated in the same device before the solid material is separated out. The air separation chamber 5 contains an apron-like and domed defiection surface 6, 7 that is deep-drawn in the middle, the mixture outlet 4 being incorporated above and outside the apron-like defiection surface 6. The suction air is passed to an air outlet 10 that is provided on an air outlet tube 9 that extends vertically in the centre of the air outlet 10. with its upper end within the annular wall 33 of the<br><br>
pre-separator that, in this embodiment, has an upper opening 8 into which the deep-drawn area of the dome-like deflection surface 7 extends. The air outlet tube has at its lower end a connector 34 for a line that runs to the suction pump. The solid material separation chamber 12 is configured as has been described in connection with Figure 1. However, the outlet tube opens out differently, in a trap chamber 35 that is arranged beneath the housing I, and which incorporates a lower housing outlet 26 for the liquid that has been processed.<br>
The embodiment shown in Figure 3 also has a separator, in the housing 1 of which there is an air separation chamber 5, as in Figure 2. and a solid material separation chamber 12, What is different in this design is the configuration of the outlet area for air and liquid, since the upper end of the drain tube 25 includes the air outlet 10 and the liquid outlet 24.  In this embodiment, the air that has been separated out is once again combined with the liquid that has been processed, and there is a line 65 on the housing outlet 26 that is associated with the outlet tube 25, said line 65 going to a suction pump that is configured as a water ring pump and is thus suitable for moving liquid.<br>
Figure 6 shows a second version without air separation, in which the mixture once again enters through the mixture inlet 4 into the sedimentation chamber 13, which is fitted with a cover 58 and the inlet chamber 50 is partitioned off from the central area by an annular baffle 52. Beneath the inlet chamber 50. the sedimentation container 13 has the first sedimentation zone 22 in which mainly coarser and heavier particles collect and through which the mixture flows downward from aho\c. At the louer end of a downflowflow baftlc 57 that forms an extension of the annular baffle 52<br><br>
over a part of the periphery, the flow in the hquid is deflected inward and upward into the second sedimentation zone 36, when mainly fine and very fine particles of solid material are carried along with it. As soon as the sedimentation reaches the level h1 that is determined by the lower edge of the downflow baffle 57, the flow path that has been described is blocked off  and the flow shifts peripherally along the downflow baffle 57 as far as its end, so that the flow path is not shortened, despite a growing sedimentation surface. The maximal sedimentation level h2 of the first sedimentation zone 22 is defined by the lower edge of the annular baffle 52.<br>
The second sedimentation zone is provided in an insert element 42 that is installed in the sedimentation container 13, provided with the annular baffle 52, and which has a bottom 43 from which-as can be seen in Figure 8-parallel overflow ridges 47 extend upward; these define the chambers 48. The bottom 43 has a first opening 45 that forms the flow connection to the first sedimentation zone 22, and a second opening 46 in the last chamber 48, through which a drain tube 25 is routed through the sedimentation chamber 13 downward into an outlet chamber 35. The upper edge of the tube 25 forms the liquid outlet 24 from the sedimentation chamber 13 in the form of a free overflow over which, after passing through the chambers 48 of the second sedimentation zone 36, liquid that is for all practical purposes free of solid material flows. The outlet chamber 35 is provided with an outlet 26 that can be connected to a waste water drain line.<br>
The mixture outlet 4 is at the same level as, or preferably slightly higher than the upper edge of the highest overflou ridge 47, so that the sedimentation container 13 is filled with liquid right up<br><br>
to this upper edge. Damping baffles 49 are also provided to prevent turbulence, at least in the inlet chamber 50, since such turbulence could disrupt the sedimentation process.<br>
As is shown in Figure 6, the first opening 45 in the insert element 42 can also be covered by an layer 55 that binds dissolved mercury' ions and. or finely dispersed elementary mercury or mercury' vapour. The layer 55 can, for example, be a metal tissue, woven metal, metal foam, etc. of a metal such as iron, zinc, tin, magnesium, copper or the like that alloys with mercury or is a base with respect to mercury.  In order to remove the mercury ions, the insert 55 can also possess ion-exchanging properties and can contain thiourea, thiourea, or similar ion exchanging materials. The insert 55 can also contain activated charcoal.<br>
In the \ersion shown in Figure 7, the separator has a housing 1 that also incorporates an air separation chamber 5 above the sedimentation chamber 13, so that the suction air that cames the mixture that is drawn into the mixture inlet 4 by way of a line 63 is separated in the same device before the solid material is separated out from the mixture. The air separation chamber 5 contains an apron-like defiection surface 6 and a dome-like defiection surface 7 that is deep drawn in the middle, the mixture inlet 4 being provided above and outside the apron-like deflection surface 6. The suction air is passed to an air outlet 10 that is provided an a tube 9 that rises centrally in the sedimentation container 13, the upper end of which is higher than the underside of the apron-like defiection surface 6. The annular baffle 52, which is connected to the bottom 43 of the insert element 42. has a defiecting baffie 59 that rises into the apron-like defiection surface 6 about half-way round the periphery, on both sides of the mixture inlet, so as<br><br>
to prevent the suction air from having a direct path to the air outlet 10. The mixture, freed of air, leaves the air separation chamber 5 through a mixture outlet 41 that extends peripherally round the apron-like deflection surface 6 and falls in the inlet chamber 50 that is located below this and which is divided into a number of slits by inclined lamellar plates that rise transversely to the direction of the inflou. The radial edges of each of the lamellar plates 51 that follow each other in sequence lie approximately above each other.<br>
As is shovvn in Figure S, in this embodiment the insert element 42 has a third, central opening 44 through which the tube 9 passes. The tube 9 opens out into the outlet chamber 35, below the sedimentation chamber 13, in which the air that has been separated out is once again combined with the liquid that has been processed. There is a line 65 on the housing outlet 26 that is associated with the outlet chamber 35, said line 65 going to a suction pump that is configured as a water ring pump and is thus suitable for moving liquid.<br>
In order not to disrupt the sedimentation of the remaining, mainly fine particles of solid material in the second sedimentation zone 36, this is screened off from the air separation chamber 5 by a more or less conical cover 53 that incorporates a central opening through which the tube 9 passes centrally.<br>
The sedimentation chamber 13 can be removed both from the outlet chamber that forms the lower part of the housing 1 as well as from the upper part of the housing 1 that encloses the air<br><br>
separation chamber 5, and when appropriately filled with sedimented solid material this will be replaced by an empty sedimentation chamber 13.<br>
Figure 9 shows another embodiment of a separator wiih an air separation chamber 5 above the sedimentation container 13; this embodiment differs from that shown in Figure 7 in a few details, which mainly ser\'e to lengthen the flow path through the first sedimentation zone 22. As compared to the one shown in Figure 7, the dow^nflow baffle 57 reaches much further downward into the sedimentation chamber 13, and the lower edge extends horizontally through an angle of approximately 240^^, and ends by sloping upward.   In other words, the downflow baffle 57 has an approximately V-shaped section 60 on the side that is opposite the mixture inlet 4. Because of this, after the increase in the direct flow path, as soon as the sediment has reached level h|, the liquid must flow along a peripheral diversion of at least 120"^ in order to reach the interior of the first sedimentation zone 22 through the V-shaped section 60. The maximal sedimentation level<br>
is defined by the lou'eredge of the annular baffle 52 in the area of the section 60.<br>
hi addition, the cover 53 of the second sedimentation zone 36 is an inclined disc, at the lowest point of which there is an opening 61 in the annular baffle 52 that permits the return flow of liquid that has been separated out from the deflected air and has collected on the cover 53 into the inlet chamber 50.<br><br><br><br>
