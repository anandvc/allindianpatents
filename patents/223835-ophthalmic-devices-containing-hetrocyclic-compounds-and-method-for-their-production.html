				<td>RELATED PATENT APPLICATIONS<br>
This patent application claims priority of a provisional application. U S.<br>
Ser No. 60/348,585 which was filed on January 14, 2002<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to opthalmic devices having antimicrobial<br>
properties as well as methods of their production, use, and storage.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Contact lenses have been used commercially to improve vision since<br>
the 1950s. The first contact lenses were made of hard materials. Although<br>
these lenses are currently used, they are not suitable for all patients due to<br>
their poor initial comfort and their relatively low permeability to oxygen. Later<br>
developments in the field gave rise to soft contact lenses, based upon<br>
hydrogels, which are extremely popular today Many users find soft lenses are<br>
more comfortable, and increased comfort levels allow soft contact lens users to<br>
wear their lenses for far longer hours than users of hard contact lenses.<br>
Despite this advantage, the extended use of the lenses can encourage<br>
the buildup of bacteria or other microbes, particularly, Pseudomonas<br>
aervginosa, on the surfaces of soft contact lenses. The build-up of bacteria or<br>
other microbes is not unique to soft contact lens wearers and may occur during<br>
the use of hard contact lenses as well.<br>
Therefore, there is a need to produce contact lenses that inhibit the<br>
growth of bacteria or other microbes and/or the adhesion of bacterial or other<br>
microbes on the surface of contact lenses Further there is a need to produce<br>
contact lenses which do not promote the adhesion and/or growth of bacteria or<br>
other microbes on the surface of the contact lenses. Also there is a need to<br>
produce contact lenses that inhibit adverse responses related to the growth of<br>
bacteria or other microbes.<br>
Others have recognized the need to produce soft contact lenses that<br>
inhibit the growth of bacteria. In US Patent No. 5.213,801. the production of an<br>
antibacterial contact lens is disclosed, where an antibacterial metal ceramic<br>
material is incorporated into a contact lens. This procedure contains a number<br>
of steps and may not be suitable for producing all types of lenses in a<br>
production environment. The steps include making a silver ceramic material<br>
that is fine enough to be used in a contact lens and then forming the lens with<br>
the powdered ceramic. However, lenses containing these types of materials<br>
often lack the clarity required by contact lens users.<br>
US 5,808,089; 5,902,818 and 6,020,491 disclose N-halamine type<br>
compounds and their use as biocides. Inclusion of these compounds in<br>
ophthalmic devices is not suggested. US 6,162,452 discloses cyclic N-<br>
halamine biocidal monomers and polymers. Materials suitable for contact<br>
lenses are not disclosed.<br>
Although these methods and lenses are known other contact lenses<br>
that inhibit the growth and/or adhesion of bacteria or other microbes and are of<br>
sufficient optical clarity, as well as methods of making those lenses are still<br>
needed. It is this need, which this invention seeks to meet.<br>

incorporated by reference for the hydrogel compositions contained therein<br>
Lenses prepared from the aforementioned formulations and the heterocyclic<br>
compound of the present invention may be coated with a number of agents<br>
that are used to coat lenses. For example, the procedures, compositions, and<br>
methods of U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,854.982; 3,916,033; 4,920,184; and 5.002,794.<br>
5.712.327; and 6,087,415 as well as WO 0127662, may be used and these<br>
patents are hereby incorporated by reference for those procedures,<br>
compositions, and methods. In addition to the cited coating patents, there are<br>
other methods of treating a lens once it is formed The lenses of this invention<br>
may be treated by these methods, which are illustrated in U. S Pat.<br>
No.5,453,467; US. Pat. No. 5.422.402; WO 9300391; U.S. Pat. No.4,973.493;<br>
and U.S. No. Pat 5,350,800, the disclosure of which are hereby incorporated<br>
by reference in their entirety.<br>
Hard contact lenses are made from polymers that include but are not<br>
limited to polymers of poly(methyl)methacrylate, silicon acrylates.<br>
fluoroacrylates, fluoroethers, polyacetylenes, and polyimides. where the<br>
preparation of representative examples may be found in JP 200010055, JP<br>
6123860; and U.S. Pat. No 4,330.383. Intraocular lenses of the invention can<br>
be formed using known materials For example, the lenses may be made from<br>
a rigid material including, without limitation, polymethyl methacrylate.<br>
polystyrene, polycarbonate, or the like, and combinations thereof. Additionally,<br>
flexible matenals may be used including, without limitation, nydrogels. silicone<br>
materials, acrylic materials, fluorocarbon materials and the like, or<br>
combinations thereof. Typical intraocular lenses are described in WO<br>
0026698; WO 0022460; WO 9929750; WO 9927978; WO 0022459; and JP<br>
2000107277 All of the references mentioned in this application are hereby<br>
incorporated by reference in their entirety.<br>
The heterocyclic compounds may be incorporated into the selected<br>
polymer by a number of methods. For example, the heterocyclic compound(s)<br>
may be dispersed or dissolved into the monomer and/or prepolymer mixtures<br>
(reactive mixtures), which are used to form the opthalrnic device. The<br>
heterocyclic compounds may contain polyrnehzable groups, which will bond to<br>
the selected reactive mixture components during processing or may be devoid<br>
of polymerizable groups. Preferred polymerizable heterocyclic compounds<br>
have at least one ethylenically unsaturated group that allows covalent<br>
incorporation of the compound into the lens matrix or onto the lens surface.<br>
Suitable ethylenically unsaturated groups include methacrylates, acrylates,<br>
styrenes, mixtures thereof and the like. The ethylenically unsaturated groups<br>
may be directly linked to the heterocyclic compounds or may include<br>
intervening branched or unbranched alkyl chains, substituted or unsubstituted<br>
aryl groups, polyethers, polyamides, polyesters and the like. Heterocyclic<br>
compounds which are devoid of polymerizable groups become entangled<br>
within the lens material when the monomer is polymerized, forming a semi-<br>
interpenetrating network.<br>
Any amount of heterocyclic compound which provides the desired level<br>
of inhibition of microbial growth but does not degrade the performance<br>
characteristics (such as. but not limited to modulus) of the resulting device may<br>
be used. In certain embodiments amounts between about 1 and about<br>
100.000 ppm are desirable, with amounts between about 1 and about 30,000<br>
ppm being preferable and amounts between about 10 and about 25,000 ppm<br>
being more preferred. Conventional tools, such as mixing, milling, adjusting<br>
the temperature and pressure during mixing, may be used to incorporate the<br>
heterocyclic compound into the reactive mixture. Once the heterocyclic<br>
compound is incorporated into the reactive mixture, the reactive mixture is<br>
used to form the desired device, using known techniques. Thus, where the<br>
device is a lens, the reactive mixture may be polymerized and molded or cast<br>
into the desired lens shape, molded or cast into a blank and lathed into the<br>
desired shape, all using conventional conditions which are well known in the<br>
art.<br>
Another method for incorporating the heterocyclic compound into the<br>
ophthalmic device is to add a polymerized heterocyclic compound to the<br>
reactive mixture and form the mixture into a device as described above.<br>
Polymerized heterocyclic compounds that can be incorporated in this manner<br>
include as at least one of R1-R7, polymerizable ethylenically unsaturated<br>
moiety, preferably methacrylate, acrylate, methacrylamide, styryl, N-vinyl<br>
amide, N-vinyl lactams, vinyl carbonates, vinyl carbamates, maleate, or<br>
fumarale The polymer may contain other monomers such as N-vinyl<br>
pyrrolidone, HEMA, and the like. In addition, the polymer may contain<br>
ethylenically unsaturated moieties such that it can function as a macromer.<br>
Yet another method for incorporating the heterocyclic compound is to<br>
deposit the heterocyclic compound on the surface of the opthalmic device<br>
This can be done by numerous ways. For example, a heterocyclic coating<br>
composition, including a polymerizable or prepolymerized heterocyclic<br>
compound, may be formed and coated onto the opthalmic device and if desired<br>
subjected to conditions sufficient to cause polymerization. Suitable<br>
heterocyclic coating compositions include, but are not limited to copolymers of<br>
HEMA and polymerizable heterocyclic compounds. It should be appreciated<br>
that the heterocyclic compound may be included in the lens polymer and<br>
coated on the lens<br>
The coating step may be accomplished by mold transfer, dip coating,<br>
spray coating, photo grafting, thermal grafting and the like. Alternatively, the<br>
heterocyclic compound may be covalently attached to the ophthalmic device<br>
via a wet finishing process, such as is disclosed in US 6,077,319, which is<br>
incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Generally a coating effective amount of the coating is used. A coating<br>
effective amount of the heterocyclic compound or heterocyclic amine precursor<br>
compound is an amount that when contacted with at least one surface of the<br>
lens is sufficient to coat that surface so as to impart the desired antimicrobial<br>
properties to the surface The coating may be a homopolymer made from<br>
polymerized heterocyclic compound or polymerized heterocyclic amine<br>
precursor compound, a copolymer of polymerizable heterocyclic compound or<br>
poJymerizabJe heterocyclic amine precursor compound with other polymers,<br>
such as but not limited to polyHEMA, polyacryfic add, PVP, combinations<br>
thereof and the like The desired coating compounds may be dissolved in<br>
volatile solvents, which are suitable for coating contact lenses and are Known<br>
in the art. By antimicrobial properties is meant either or both the ability to<br>
significantly reduce, meaning by greater than about 25 percent, either or both<br>
the amount of bacteria adhering to the surface and the growth of bacteria<br>
adhered to the surface In the case of contact lenses, generally, the amount<br>
contacted with the lens is about 1 µg to about 10 mg, preferably about 10 µg to<br>
about 1 mg per lens. The amount of coating resulting per contact lens is about<br>
50 to about 1000 µg. Coatings of the present invention comprise between<br>
about 1000 µg heterocyclic compound or heterocyclic amine precursor<br>
compound.<br>
It should be appreciated that, for any of the methods of incorporation<br>
described above, the heterocyclic compound may be added with the chlorine or<br>
bromine atom already attached to the nitrogen or without. If the heterocyclic<br>
compound does not contain at least one chlorine when it is incorporated into<br>
the device, the device containing the heterocyclic compound will need to be<br>
"charged" by contact with a suitable chlorine source. Suitable chlorine source<br>
contain anywhere up to about 50,000 ppm sodium or calcium hypochtorite in<br>
aqueous solution, from about 10 ppm to 1000 ppm sodium<br>
dtchloroisocyanurate and/or trichloroisocyanuric acid in aqueous solution and<br>
other N-chloramines. The chlorine source also comprises a liquid medium<br>
such as, but not limited to, water, deionized water, aqueous buffered solutions,<br>
alcohols, polyols, polyethers, glycols and mixtures thereof. Preferred media<br>
include deionized water and aqueous buffered solutions. It should be<br>
appreciated that as the chlorine concentration increases, the contact time with<br>
the solution will decrease. Once the device is charged (or recharged) it is<br>
rinsed with an ophthalmically compatible saline solution to remove unbound<br>
chlorine and ready the device for use (or reuse). The chlorine charging may<br>
take place at any point in the process, but convenient points include during<br>
release from the mold, during wet storage, during nydration of a dry stored lens<br>
and as a separate step after some period of storage or use. It should be<br>
appreciated that a single device, and particularly a single lens could be<br>
recharged a multiple of times to extend its antimicrobial effectiveness.<br>
The terms "antimicrobial", "reduction in microbial activity" and "inhibition<br>
of microbial activity"refer to a device that exhibit one or more of the following<br>
properties - the inhibition of the adhesion of bacteria or other microbes to the<br>
ophthalmic device, the inhibition of the growth of bacteria or other microbes on<br>
the ophthalmic device, and the killing of bacteria or other microbes on the<br>
surface of the ophthalmic device or in a radius extending from the ophthalmic<br>
device The lenses of the invention inhibit the microbial activity by at least<br>
25%. Preferably, the lenses of the invention exhibit at least a "Nog reduction<br>
(&gt; 90% inhibition) of viable bacteria or other microbes, more preferably a 2-log<br>
reduction (&gt; 99% inhibition) of viable bacteria or other microbes. Such bacteria<br>
or other microbes include but are not limited to those organisms found in the<br>
eye, particularly Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acanthamoeba species,<br>
Staphyloccus. aureus, E. coli. Staphyloccus epidermidis, and Serratia<br>
marcesens. Preferably, said antimicrobial lens is a clear lens, that has clarity<br>
comparable to lenses such as those formed from etafilcon A, genfilcon A,<br>
lenefilcon A, polymacon, acquafilcon A, balafilcon A, and lotrafilcon A.<br>
The advantages of the antimicrobial lenses of the present invention are<br>
many. Without being bound to any particular theory, it is believed that<br>
reduction of bacterial activity on the lenses should reduce the occurrence of<br>
adverse responses related to bacterial adhesion. It is believed that the<br>
heterocyclic compounds of the present invention reduce microbial activity by<br>
slow release of small quantities of HOCI. which is an antimicrobial substance<br>
produced by the body to kill bacteria Thus, the lenses of the present invention<br>
mimic the eye's chemical response to microbial activity. In addition<br>
hypochlorous acid is not known to induce resistance in bacteria. It is further<br>
believed that the halamine moiety (N-X. where X is Br or Cl) of the heterocyclic<br>
compounds of the present invention interact directly with bacteria to further<br>
reduce microbial activity<br>
The heterocyclic compounds may also be recharged' to provide<br>
antimicrobial activity throughout the life of the lens. The antimicrobial lenses of<br>
the invention have comparable clarify to lenses sucn as those formed from<br>
etafilicon A. genfilcon A, lenefilcon A, poiymacon, acquafilcon A, balafilcon A,<br>
and lotrafilcon A.<br>
Further, the invention includes a method of producing an antimicrobial<br>
lens comprising a polymer and at least one heterocyclic amine precursor,<br>
wherein said hydrogen can be readily replaced with a chlorine or bromine ion.<br>
wherein the method comprises, consists essentially of, or consists of the steps<br>
of<br>
(a) preparing a lens comprising a lens polymer and at least one<br>
heterocyclic amine precursor and<br>
(b) contacting said lens with a chlorine or bromine source.<br>
The heterocyclic amine precursor has the same structure as the<br>
heterocyclic compound defined above, except that the halogen is replaced with<br>
a H. Methods for their preparation are known in the art and are generally<br>
disclosed in US 6,162,452, which is incorporated herein by reference. The<br>
terms lens and chlorine or bromine source, all have the meanings defined<br>
above. The heterocyclic amine precursor may be polymerized into the lens<br>
polymer, prepolymerized and incorporated into the reaction mixture, which is<br>
then polymerized to form an interpenetrating network with the polymer or<br>
covalently appended to the lens polymer or coated onto the lens surface either<br>
in monomeric or polymeric form or any combination of the above, all as<br>
described above.<br>
Typically, the contacting step is conducted for about 120 minutes, though<br>
the time may vary from about 1 minute to about 4 hours and at temperatures<br>
ranging from about 5°C to about 130°C. After the contacting step the lenses<br>
are washed with several portions of water to obtain a lens that is fully charged<br>
with chlorine and substantially free from unbound chlorine<br>
Still further, the invention includes a lens case comprising, consisting<br>
essentially of. a lens case polymer and at least one heterocyciic compound<br>
comprising at least one N-CI or N-Br bond. The term lens case refers to a<br>
container that is adapted to define a space in which to hold a lens wnen that<br>
lens is not in use. This term includes packaging for lenses, where packaging<br>
includes any unit in which a lens is stored after curing. Examples of this<br>
packaging include but are not limited to single use blister packs, multiple use<br>
storage cases and the like Suitable containers may have multiple parts such<br>
as the outer container, which holds the lens, a cover and a lens basket, which<br>
supports the Jens within the chamber inside the container The heterocyciic<br>
compound can be incorporated in any of these parts, but is preferably<br>
incorporated into the lens container or the lens basket.<br>
Suitable lens case polymers include, but are not limited to thermoplastic<br>
polymeric material, such as polymethylmethacrylate, polyolefins, such as<br>
polyethylene, polypropylene, their copolymers and the like; polyesters,<br>
polyurethanes; acrylic polymers, such as polyacrylates and polymethacrylates,<br>

The heterocyciic compound may be incorporated into the lens container<br>
in the same manner that it is incorporated into the antimicrobial lenses of the<br>
invention. More specifically, the heterocyciic compound is combined (either as<br>
a polymerizable or non-polyrnerizable compound) with the formulation of the<br>
other components, molded and cured. Preferably the heterocyciic compound<br>
is present in any or all of the lens case components at about 0 01 to about<br>
10.0 weight percent (based on the initial monomer mix), more preferably about<br>
0.01 to about 1.5 percent. Storing lenses in such an environment inhibits the<br>
growth of bacteria on said lenses and adverse effects that are caused by the<br>
proliferation of bacteria. Another example of such a lens case is the lens case<br>
can be found in U.S. Pat. No. 6,029.808 which is hereby incorporated by<br>
reference for the blister pack housing for a contact lens disclosed therein.<br>

The flask was fitted with a reflux condenser and a nitrogen inlet, and the<br>
contents were refluxed for 48 hours. The reflux condenser was then replaced<br>
with a distillation condenser, and the ethanol formed as a by-product in the<br>
reaction was distilled off. The reaction mixture was diluted with 100 mL ethyl<br>
acetate, and then poured into 400 mL diethyl ether. Upon vigorous stirring, a<br>
precipitate formed, which was filtered out, washed with diethyl ether (2 x 50<br>
mL), and dried to obtain a white solid (14 4 g. 86 3% yield). Structure (Formula<br>
2) was confirmed via 1H NMR and 13C NMR data.<br>

sodium chloride solution (1 x 50 mL). The organic layer was dried over<br>
anhydrous sodium sulfate, filtered, and the solvent was removed in vacuo<br>
using a roto-evaporator to yield clear, pale yellow oil (2.96 g, 69.5 % yield).<br>
Structure (Formula 3) was confirmed via 1H NMR and 13C NMR data.<br>
Formula 3. 4-acryloxymethyl-4-ethyl-2-oxazolidinone<br>
Example 3<br>
To a dry container housed in a dry box under nitrogen at ambient<br>
temperature was added 30.0 g (0.277 mol) of bis(dimethylamino)methylsilane,<br>
a solution of 13 75 ml of a 1M solution of TBACB (386.0 g TBACB in 1000 ml<br>
dry THF), 61.39 g (0.578 mol) of p-xylene, 154.28 g (1.541 mol) methyl<br>
methacrylate (1.4 equivalents relative to initiator), 1892.13 (9.352 mol) 2-<br>
(trimethylsiloxy)ethyl methacrylate (8.5 equivalents relative to initiator) and<br>
4399.78 g (61 01 mol) of THF. To a dry, three-necked, round-bottomed flask<br>
equipped with a thermocouple and condenser, all connected to a nitrogen<br>
source, was charged the above mixture prepared in the dry box<br>
The reaction mixture was cooled to 15 °C while stirring and purging with<br>
nitrogen. After the solution reaches 15 °C, 191.75 g (1 100 mol) of 1 -<br>
trimethylsiloxy-1-methoxy-2-methylpropene (1 equivalent) was injected into the<br>
reaction vessel. The reaction was allowed to exotherm to approximately 62 °C<br>
and then 30 ml of a 0 40 M solution of 154.4 g TBACB in 11 ml of dry THF was<br>
metered in throughout the remainder of the reaction After the temperature of<br>
reaction reached 30 °C and the metering began, a solution of 467.56 g (2.311<br>
mol) 2-(trimethylsiloxy)ethyl methacrylate (2 1 equivalents relative to the<br>
initiator), 3636.6 g (3.463 mol) n-butyl monomethacryloxypropyl-<br>
polydrmethylsiloxane (3.2 equivalents relative to the initiator), 3673.84 g (8.689<br>
mol) TRIS (7.9 equivalents relative to the initiator) and 20.0 g<br>
bis(dimethylamino)methylsilane was added.<br>
The mixture was allowed to exotherm to approximately 38-42 °C and<br>
then allowed to cool to 30 °C. At that time, a solution of 10.0 g (0 076 mo!)<br>
bis(dimethylamino)methylsilane, 154.26 g (1.541 mol) methyl methacrylate (1,4<br>
equivalents relative to the initiator) and 1892.13 g (9.352 mol) 2-<br>
trimethylsiloxy)ethyl methacrylate (8.5 equivalents relative to the initiator) was<br>
added and the mixture again allowed to exotherm to approximately 40 °C. The<br>
reaction temperature dropped to approximately 30 °C and 2 gallons of THF<br>
were added to decrease the viscosity A solution of 439.69 g water, 740.6 g<br>
methanol and 8.8 g (0.068 mol) dichforoacetic acid was added and the mixture<br>
refluxed for 4.5 hours to de-block the protecting groups on the HEMA<br>
Volatiles were then removed and toluene added to aid in removal of the water<br>
until a vapor temperature of 110 °C was reached.<br>
The reaction flask was maintained at approximately 110 °C and a<br>
solution of 443 g (2.201 mol) TMI and 5.7 g (0.010 mol) dibutyltin dilaurate<br>
were added. The mixture was reacted until the isocyanate peak was gone by<br>
IR. The toluene was evaporated under reduced pressure to yield an off-white,<br>
anhydrous, waxy reactive monomer. The macromer was placed into acetone<br>
at a weight basis of approximately 21 acetone to macromer After 24 hrs,<br>
water was added to precipitate out the macromer and the macromer was<br>
filtered and dried using a vacuum oven between 45 and 60 °C for 20-30 hrs<br>
Example 4<br>
A reaction mixture was formed by adding 80 parts of the components<br>
shown in Table 1, in the amounts shown in Table 1 with 20 parts 3,7-dimethyl-<br>
3-octanol. Specifically, in the following order macromer. Norbloc 7966, diluent,<br>
TEGDMA, HEMA. DMA, TRIS, and mPDMS were added to an amber flask<br>
These components were mixed at 170-300 rpm, at 50-55 0C. for 90 to 180<br>
minutes. While maintaining mixing, blue HEMA was added and the<br>
components mixed for a further 20 to 75 minutes (at 170-300 rpm, 50-55 °C).<br>
Still with mixing, PVP was added and the mixture stirred for another 20 to 140<br>
minutes (at 170-300 rpm, 50-55 °C).<br>
To 10 g of the monomer mix above, were added 209.7 mg of 4-acryloxymethyl-<br>
4-ethyl-2-oxazolidinone (as prepared in Example 2, above), 80 mg of CG11850<br>
(Ciba lot# 2W419S), and 100 mg of acetic acid (Fischer Scientific lot# 983683).<br>
This mixture was mechanically stirred at 500C for one hour to homogenize the<br>
components. The monomer mix was degassed under vacuum for 30 minutes,<br>
and used to make lenses in a nitrogen box at 60-650C. utilizing Topas alicyclic<br>
copolymer (available from Ticona. grade 5013) (front curve, Power -0.50 D)<br>
and (back curve) frames under Philips TL03 lamps with 30 minutes of<br>
irradiation. The monomer mix and frames were equilibrated in the nitrogen box<br>
for 10 minutes prior to assembly. The cured lenses were manually demolded,<br>
and immersed in 150 ml of 60:40 mixture of IPA (Mallinckrodt. AR (ACS)<br>
grade) and deionized (Ol) water, respectively. The released lenses were<br>
transferred into 100 ml of IPA, and then stepped down into Ol water as<br>
follows: i) 100 ml of 75:25 (IPA:DI water): ii) 100 ml of 50:50 (IPA:DI water);<br>
iii) 100 mL of 25:75 (IPA:DI water); iv) 100 mL of Dl water; v) 100 mL of Dl<br>
water; vi) 100 mL of Dl water; vii) 100 mL of Dl water; viii) 100 mL of Dl water.<br>
The lenses were allowed to equilibrate for 20 minutes in between exchanges.<br>
Lenses from the last Dl water wash were stored in a 100 mL of fresh Dl water<br>
Example 5<br>
A hydrogel blend was made from the following monomer mix (all amounts<br>
were calculated as weight percent of the total weight of the combination).<br>
17.98% Macromer (Ex 3), 28.0% mPDMS, 14.0% TRIS, 260% DMA, 5 0%<br>
HEMA, 1.0% TEGDMA. 5 0% PVP. 20% Norbloc. 1.25 % acetic acid, 1.0% CGI<br>
1850. and 0.02% Blue HEMA; 80 weight percent of the preceding component<br>
mixture was further diluted with diluent, 20 weight percent of D3O The monomer<br>
mix was degassed under vacuum at a temperature of 55°C for at least 30<br>
minutes. The monomer mix was used to prepare lenses using Topas (Ticona,<br>
grade 5013) front curves, and polypropylene (Fina, grade EOD 00-11) back<br>
curves. The lenses were cured under visible light Philips TL 03 bulbs in a<br>
nitrogen atmosphere (
The cured lenses were demolded, and then released, leached and<br>
hydrated using IPA-deionized water mixtures The lenses were autodaved in<br>
packing solution for use in microbiological testing.<br>
Example 6<br>
Five lenses, prepared as described in Example 4, were treated with 25<br>
mL of dilute sodium hypochlorite solution [1 part Clorox™ bleach (5.25%<br>
NaOCI) and 99 pan's Dl water] by rolling the solution and lenses in a jar on a<br>
jar roller for 2 hours. The solution was then decanted, and the lenses were<br>
washed with Ol water (3 x 30 mL) by rolling the lenses on a jar roller.<br>
The lenses were autodaved (30 minutes at 121°C) in special packing<br>
solution.<br>
The autodaved lenses were analyzed for efficacy against P aenjginosa<br>
using the following method. A culture of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, ATCC#<br>
15442 (American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, MD), was grown overnight<br>
in a tryptic soy medium. The bacterial inoculum was prepared to result in a<br>
final concentration of approximately 1 x 106 colony forming units/mL (cfu/mL)<br>
Three contact lenses were rinsed with phosphate buffered saline (PBS, pH =<br>
7 4 +/- 0.2) to remove residual packing solution Each rinsed contact lens was<br>
placed with 2 mL of the bacterial inoculum into a sterile glass vial, which was<br>
then rotated in a shaker-incubator (100 rpm) for two hours at 37 +/- 2°C. Each<br>
lens was removed from the glass vial, rinsed with PBS to remove loosely<br>
bound cells, placed into individual wells of a 24-well microtiter plate containing<br>
1 mL PBS, and rotated in a shaker-incubator for an additional 22 hours at 37 +/-<br>
2°C. Each lens was again rinsed with PBS to remove loosely bound cells,<br>
placed into 10 mL of PBS containing 0 05% (w/v) Tween™ 80, and vortexed at<br>
2000 rpm for three minutes, employing centrifugal force to disrupt adhesion of<br>
the remaining bacteria to the lens. The resulting supernatant was enumerated<br>
for viable bacteria and the results of detectable viable bacteria attached to<br>
three lenses wore averaged and are reported in Table 2. below. Lenses from<br>
Example 4. autoclaved in special packing solution, were used as the controls<br>
for microbiological experiments.<br>
Thus, the lenses containing N-halamine showed a 0.77 log reduction in<br>
microbial adhesion vs. the lens containing the halamine precursor<br>
Example 7<br>
Six lenses, prepared as described in Example 4, were treated with 100<br>
mL of dilute sodium hypochlorite solution [10 part Clorox™ bleach (5.25%<br>
NaOCI) and 90 parts Dl water] by rolling the solution and lenses in a jar on a<br>
jar roller for 2.5 hours. The solution was then decanted, and the lenses were<br>
washed with Dl water (3 x 100 mL) by rolling the lenses on a jar roller, allowing<br>
one hour for the first wash and two hours for subsequent washes. The lenses<br>
were autoclaved in special packing solution and analyzed for efficacy using the<br>
procedures described in Example 6. Lenses made according to Example 5<br>
(containing no precursor) were used as controls The results are listed in Table<br>
3, below.<br>
Thus the tenses containing N-halamine showed a 1.55 log reduction vs.<br>
the lens containing no halamine.<br>
Since there was no substantial difference noted between the 'log CFU'<br>
counts for Example 4 (N-halamine precursor) and Example 5 (no halamine<br>
precursor), the incorporation of N-halamine precursor itself does not confer<br>
antimicrobial properties to the lenses.<br>
A comparison of Examples 6 and 7 suggests that increasing the<br>
concentration of sodium hypochlorite solution used to treat the lenses may<br>
improved efficacy (decrease bacterial adhesion).<br>
