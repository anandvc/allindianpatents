				<td>WIPER BLADE ASSEMBLY FOR MOTOR VEHICLE<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a wiper blade for wiping a windshield of a motor vehicle, and more particularly, to a so-called flat blade wiper which can be connected to a wiper ami without a primary and a secondary yokes.<br>
2.	Description of the Related Art<br>
An example of the conventional Hat blade wiper is disclosed by U. S. Patent No. 5.970.569.   The wiper blade disclosed in the patent is configured in such a manner that a \\ ipcr strip made of a rubber is inserted into a load supporting element that has a slit formed at the center thereof and is made of spring steel and the wiper strip is then fixed lo the load supporting element using a claw.<br>
In the conventional flat blade wiper, however, manufacturing cost is high because a connecting device that is connected to the wiper arm is complicated.    Further, although the \\iper blade requires higher longitudinal rigidity due to its repealed motion, such rigidity can be provided to the Hat blade only by the load-supporting element taking the shape of a •:j-shaped rail.   Therefore, a shaking or chattering is-generated in the conventional flat blade due to the repeated motion of the wiper blade.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The object of the present invention is to provide a wiper blade assembly in which an elastic support member and a connection member can be easily connected with each oilier.<br>
1 he other object ol the present invention is to provide a wiper blade assembly for preventing a wiper from rising even though a vehicle travels at a high speed.<br><br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a flat blade assembly having spoiler with a good performance for preventing a wiper from rising.<br>
According to an aspec 'of the present invention for achieving the objects, there is provided a wiper blade assembly for a motor vehicle which comprises a flexible elongated \\ iper strip that includes opposite longitudinal grooves and comes into close contact with a windshield of the vehicle; a rail spring including rail portions disposed in the opposite grooves of the wiper strip; an elastic support member that extends along a longitudinal direction of the wiper strip and includes a plurality of openings; and a connection member which includes an inserting portion inserted in the opening of the elastic support member for connection with the elastic support member and a claw for holding both the wiper strip and the rail spring.<br>
In addition, the inserting portion of the connection member includes a pair of elastic pieces which can be elastically deformed into a state where the elastic pieces can pass through the opening of tlv elastic support member and can be elastically restored to a state where the elastic pieces can be caught into the elastic support member not to come out from the opening after the elastic pieces have passed through the opening.<br>
According to the wiper blade assembly, since the pair of clastic pieces which can pass through the opening of the elastic support member and then can be elastically restored not to come out from the opening is provided, the wiper strip can be very simply mounted to the elastic support member in one touch mode in the case of a so-called Hat blade wiper, i'urther, the elastic support member makes flat blade wiper assembly have higher rigidity than the flat blade which is supported only by the load-supporting element taking the shape of a n-shaped rail.   Therefore, a shaking or chattering generated in the conventional flat blade due to the repeated motion of the wiper blade can be reduced.<br>
It is preferred that each of the elastic pieces have a sectional shape of a sector as viewed from a lateral direction of the elastic support member.    However, if the elastic pieces can be inserted into the opening of the elastic support member when they are elastically deformed and if the clastic pieces cannot come out from the opening when they arc elastically restored after they have passed through the opening, the elastic pieces having anv oilier shapes may be employed.<br><br>
Furthermore, a spoiler may be provided on a top surface of the elastic support member, whereby the unnecessary rise of the wiper blade assembly from a vehicle windshield can be prevented even though the vehicle mounted with such a wiper blade assembly travels at a high speed.<br>
Preferably, the spoiler includes a claw portion for holding the elastic support member and is attached to the elastic support member by means of an adhesive. Therefore, since the claw portion is integrated into the spoiler, the spoiler can be more lirmly attached to the elastic support member.<br>
The wiper blade assembly may further comprise a connector for connecting a wiper arm to the substantial center of the elastic support member, wherein the spoiler is separated at a position of the connector on the top surface of the elastic support member. Mere, the spoiler is divided into two parts with respect to the connector of the wiper arm.<br>
On the other hand, according to the other embodiment of present invention, a spoiler is provided with an extension part extending downwardly to vehicle window at one side of longitudinal direction of the spoiler.<br>
According to the construction, the spoiler which has an extension part extending downward to vehicle window at one side of longitudinal direction of the spoiler can remarkably prevent the rise ot &gt;viper which may occur when the vehicle travels at a high speed.<br>
Preferably, the spoiler is made of rubber or plastic.    Since the color of spoiler can be easily changed in these materials, it is possible to enhance the esthetic effect of the Hat blade wiper assembly.<br>
Furthermore, according to the other embodiment of present invention, the both ends of the spoiler bury the elastic support member.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Hereinafter, the present invention will be described in detail with reference to accompanying drawings.<br><br>
FIG. 1 shows a side view of a wiper blade assembly 10 according to the present invention.   As shown in FIG. I, the wiper blade assembly 10 comprises an elastic support member I, a wiper strip 20, and a connection member 30 that connects the elastic support member 1 and the wiper strip 20.   The elastic support member 1 extends along a longitudinal direction of the wiper strip 20 and is formed with an opening (not shown) at the bottom thereof.    Flere, an inserting portion 31 of the connection member 30 can be inserted into the opening of the elastic support member 1.   The elastic support member I has predetermined flexibility such that it can be suitably curved together with the wiper strip 20 to correspond to a curvature of a vehicle windshield.<br>
FIG. 1 schematically shows the wiper blade assembly.   However, an original shape of the actual wiper blade assembly 10 is curved to have a predetermined curvature as shown as a dotted line A.   The wiper blade assembly is designed such that its curvature is larger than a maximum curval ".re of an actual windshield of the vehicle.    In practice, when the wiper blade assembly 10 comes into contact with a windshield of the vehicle, both ends of the wiper strip 20 first come into contact with the windshield of the vehicle and a central portion of the wiper blade assembly 10 is slowly pressed down by a wiper arm (not shown) so that the whole wiper strip is brought into close contact with the windshield of the vehicle.   The predetermined curvature is calculated such that a contact pressure is distributed uniformly throughout the whole wiper strip by means of a force applied by the \\ iper arm.<br>
Further, a connector assembly 110 to which the wiper arm can be connected is connected to the elastic support member I at a central portion thereof.<br>
Furthermore, the connection member 30 penetrate through the opening (described later) of the elastic support im • iber 111.<br>
FIG. 2 shows a partial perspective view of the wiper blade assembly 10. in which a section taken along line 1-1 of FIG. 1 is depicted.<br>
As shown in FIG. 2, the wiper strip 20 comprises a wiper lip 21 which comes into direct contact with the windshield of the vehicle so as to remove foreign substances accumulated on the vehicle windshield or to wipe out rain, snow or the like fallen on the vehicle windshield when it operates.    The wiper lip 2 i is made of a rubber material.    The<br><br>
wiper lip 21 is connected to a wiper body portion 23 by a tilting strut 22.    When the wiper blade assembly operates in such a manner that the wiper lip 21 is slid along a surface of the vehicle windshield, the tilting strut 22 is properly tilted from side to side to allow the wiper lip 21 to move smoothly.<br>
Further, the wiper stri«- 20 includes opposite grooves 25 and 26 that are formed at an upper portion of the wiper body portion 23 in a longitudinal direction of the wiper strip 20.    It is preferred that the grooves 25 and 26 be formed along the entire length of the \\ iper strip 20.    Rails 15 and 16 of a rail spring 13 are disposed in the grooves 25 and 26.<br>
According to the present invention, the connection member 30 is provided as shown in FIG. 2.   The connection member 30 comprises a pair of the elastic pieces 3 la and 3 Ib that is inserted into the opening 100 of the elastic support member 1 for their connection and a claw 33 that is integrally formed with the pair of elastic pieces 3 la and 31 b and allows the wiper strip 20 and the rail spring 13 to be simultaneously held.<br>
FIG. 3 shows a partial sectional view taken along line 11-11 of FIG. 2. For simple illustration, only the elastic support member 1 and the connection member 30 are shown in FIG. 3.<br>
Referring to FIG. 3, a section of the pair of the elastic pieces 3 la and 3 I b lakes the shape of a sector as viewed from a lateral direction of the elastic support member I.    The connection member 30 is formed with a stopper 3 adjacent to the elastic pieces 3 la and 31b.   The connection member 30 is inserted into the opening 100 from below the elastic support member 1.    When the connection member 30 starts to be inserted into the opening 100. circular arc portions of the elastic pieces 3 la and 31 b come into contact with the clastic support member 1.    If the connection member 30 is further inserted, the elastic pieces 3 la and 31b thereof arc elastically deformed in a direction in which they face each other.    The elastic pieces 3 la and 32b of the connection member 30 are formed to have such a six.e that they can pass through the opening 100 when they are elastically deformed as described above.   After the elastic pieces 3 I a and 3 1 b have fully passed through the opening 100, the elastic pieces 3 la and 3 !b are restored to an original shape shown in FIG. 3.    Thereafter, the elastic pieces 3 1 a and 3 i b cannot be escaped from the opening 1 00 in. the inserting direction, and the stopper 3 prevents the clastic pieces 3 la and 3 I b from<br><br>
further moving into the opening 100.<br>
A sectional shape of the elastic pieces 3 la and 3 Ib, which is viewed from the lateral direction of the elastic support member 1, is not limited to a sector shape.   If the elastic pieces 3 la and 31b can pass through the opening of the elastic support member 1 when they are elastically deformed and if the elastic pieces 3 la and 3lb cannot be escaped from the opening 100 after they have passed through the opening, any types of the elastic pieces so configured can be employed.   Further, although the rectangular opening 100 is used in this embodiment, any shapes can be used herein if the above conditions are satisfied.<br>
Furthermore, if the connection member 30 having these elastic pieces 3 la and 3 Ib is employed, it is not necessary to perform a complicated process such as welding and it is possible to allow the elastic support member 1 to be thinner.   Therefore, the advantages that the assembly process is conveniently performed and the costs of production are reduced can be obtained.<br>
The claw 33 of the connection member 30 covers the wiper strip 20 to allow the connection member 30 and the wiper strip 20 to be clamped with each other, as shown in FIG. 2.<br>
As described above, since the elastic pieces 3 la and 3 Ib of the connection member 30 conveniently penetrate through the opening oflhe elastic support member 1 for their connection and the claw 32 is .lamped with the wiper strip 20, the elastic support member I and the wiper strip 20 are connected with each other via the connection member 30.<br>
FIG. 4 shows a side view of a wiper blade assembly according to a still further embodiment of the present invention.   This embodiment is different from the embodiments shown in FIGS. 1 to 3 in that spoilers 40a and 40b are further provided on the top surface of the elastic support member I.<br>
FIG. 5 shows a partial perspective view of the wiper blade assembly, in which its section taken along line Ill-Ill of FIG. 4 is depicted.   As shown in FIG. 5. the elastic-pieces 3 la and 3 Ib that have penetrated through and protruded from the opening 100 of the elastic support member 1 are embedded in the spoiler 40a.   The shapes of the spoilers 40a and 4()b can vary according to the need for design and is no.1 also limited to the shape<br><br>
shown in FIGS. 5 and 6.   Fur ter, the spoilers 40a and 40b can be hollow, if necessary.<br>
FIG. 6 shows a sectional view taken along line IV-IV of FIG. 4.<br>
The configuration in which the connection member 30 is connected with the elastic support member 1 and with the wiper strip 20 is the same as that of the embodiment shown in FIGS. 1 to 3.   It is preferred that the spoiler 40a include claw-shaped ends 400a and 400b for holding both ends of the elastic support member 1. The spoiler is divided into the left and right spoilers 40a and 40b with respect to the connector assembly 110, and the spoilers 40a and 40b can be attached to the elastic support member 11 1 by means of an adhesive etc.<br>
As further embodiment of present invention shown in FIGS.7 and 8, a pair of spoilers 40a and 40b are provided with an extension part extending downwardly to vehicle w indow at the one side of lonjvtudinal direction of spoilers.   The extension part is located lacing vehicle window.   In this construction, the flat blade wiper can be remarkably prevented from rising when the vehicle travels at a high speed.<br>
Preferably, the spoilers 40a and 4()b are made of rubber or plastic material.   Since it is possible to easily adopt color of the spoilers in these materials, it is possible to enhance the esthetic effect of the flat blade wiper assembly.    Further, it is preferred that the rail springs 1 5 and 16, the spoilers 40a and 4()b arc preferably produced by insert injection process.    In this process, the components can be easily connected to the connection member 30. thereby achieving mass production of Hal blade wiper assembly.<br>
Furthermore, FIG. 9 shows a sectional view of the wiper blade assembly, according to the further embodiment of the present invention.    In the embodiment, the bottom part of spoiler 40a covers whole bottom face of the elastic support member 100, and it is possible to attach the spoiler 40a to the clastic support member 100 more firmly than the embodiment shown in the FIG. 3.   As the embodiment shown in FIGS.7 and 8, the extension part is also provided at the one longitudinal side of spoiler 4()a.<br>
FIG. 10 shows a perspective view of the connector assembly 1 10 of the wiper blade assembly 10 according to the present invention, and FIG. II is a sectional view illustrating a slate where a wiper arm 800 is fastened to the connector assembly 1 10.    A connector 1 I is fix.cd to the connector assembly I 10 by means of a pin 70 through a<br><br>
riveting process.<br>
Although the connector 1 1 shown in FIGS. 10 and 1 1 is a so-called "U hook type" connector, any kinds of connectors can be used in the wiper blade assembly 10 of the present invention.   That is, in addition to the connector shown in FIGS. 10 and 11, all kinds of known connectors, fc. example, a top locking type connector, a side locking type connector and the like can be applied to the present invention.<br>
FIG. 12 shows a perspective view of the wiper blade assembly, according to the still further embodiment of the present invention.   By the embodiment, the both ends 140a and 140b of longitudinal direction of the spoilers of flat blade 40a and 40b bury the elastic support member.<br>
According to the present invention as described above, since the elastic support member is provided to the wiper blade assembly called the flat blade wiper in the longitudinal direction of the wiper strip, there is an advantage in that longitudinal rigidity of the wiper blade assembly can be further increased.<br>
If the longitudinal rigidity of the wiper blade assembly is increased as described above, the shaking or chatterir'j phenomenon due to the repeated motions of the wiper blade assembly is reduced.<br>
Further, there are other advantages in that the wiper strip and the elastic support member can be easily connected to each other by means of the connection member including the inserting poition(s) and the claw, and that unit cost of production of the wiper blade assembly is lowered as compared with the conventional flat blade wiper.<br>
Furthermore, there is another advantage in that the assembly time can be remarkably shortened by connecting the connection member and the elastic support member in one touch mode.<br>
In addition, since the spoiler is provided on the upper portion of the elastic support member, the reduction of wiping performance caused by the rise of the wiper blade assembly from the vehicle wjr.Hshield can be prevented even though the vehicle travels at a high speed.    Finally, since both lateral ends of the spoiler are shaped as a claw, a fastening force between the spoiler and the elastic support member can be increased.<br>
And. since the extension part exiending downwardly to vehicle window is<br><br>
provided at one longitudinal side of the spoiler, the rising of the flat blade wiper can be further prevented.<br>
Although the present invention has been described in connection with the embodiments illustrated in the accompanying drawings, the scope of the present invention is defined by the appended claims and it should not be construed as being limited to the embodiments.<br>
