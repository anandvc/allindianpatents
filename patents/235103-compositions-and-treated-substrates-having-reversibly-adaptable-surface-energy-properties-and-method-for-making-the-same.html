				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates generally to substrates that exhibit useful, auto adaptable surface energy properties that depend on the environment of the substrate. Such surface energy properties provide relatively high advancing and receding contact angles for liquids when In contact with the target substrate surface. In particular, the substrates exhibit low surface energy quantities of at most about 20 millijoules per square meter (mJ/m2), as measured by Goniometry and calculated by Fowkes equation, at a temperature of about 25<br>
F<br>
degrees C and a surface energy greater than about 20 mJ/m2 at, or with exposure to, a temperature of about 40 degrees C. This unique ability for automatic surface energy modification, In turn, provides surfaces that are water and oil repellent, that exhibit certain degrees of stain resistance, and that impart effective stain release properties to the target substrate In addition, this unique surface energy profile is repeatable and reversible depending on the exposure environment. Novel compositions and formulations that impart such surface energy modifications to substrates are also encompassed within this invention, as well as methods for producing such treated substrates More specifically, encompassed within the present invention are textile substrates having this highly desirable unique surface energy modification property and which exhibit wash durable oil and water repellency and soil and/or stain release features.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
It has long been a necessity, particularly within the textile industry, to provide substrates, such as apparel fabrics, as one example, that exhibit a number of simultaneous wash-durable properties. Most notably, water repellency, oil repellency, stain resistance, and stain release characteristics are highly desirable to facilitate cleaning of substrates, if not to prevent complete staining thereof. Unfortunately, provision of such simultaneous and wash-durable characteristics has been severely limited due to the general difficulties with meeting certain surface energy requirements throughout the wash-durable life of such a substrate Generally, coatings or other treatments have not been readily available or widely known that can provide coexistent water and oil repellency and stain release on a wash durable basis to fabrics (or other surfaces) because the surface energy profile required for<br><br><br>
one of these properties is disparately different from the surface energy profile required to part the other property at the same time.<br>
Although there have been some instances of initial simultaneous existence of both properties on certain substrates (as noted below), unfortunately, the degree of wash-durability thereof has been unacceptable for long-term utilization of target substrates. As a result, any significant reduction in either oil or water repellency consequently reduces stain repellency as well. With a reduced propensity to repel stains, the ability to effectuate proper stain release may likewise be diminished, particularly upon exposure to greater degrees of staining and wherein the surface energy profile needed for proper stain release function (which is similar to that needed to impart the aforementioned water and oil repellency properties) is compromised (e.g., is not wash-durable).<br>
Hence, truly effective wash-durable, long-term, stain repellent and stain release treatments have not been forthcoming, since simultaneous prevention of both polar (aqueous) and non-polar (olefinic) liquid penetration into such fabric surfaces has been very difficult to achieve that can withstand extended common laundering procedures. This problem with prior oil and water repellent surface treatments is most prominently observed on typical high stain substrates such as cotton-containing fabrics. Such fabrics are generally difficult to modify at their surfaces to the extent necessary to impart both oil and water repellent features thereto and to retain an acceptable hand. These at least three properties (stain release, water repellency, and oil repellency) are simply unavailable to the textile industry on a wash-durable basis due to the aforementioned surface energy issues. A description of such surface energy properties helps to permit a better understanding of such a phenomenon.<br>
A fundamental physical property of any material is its surface energy. This property is usually expressed in mJ/m2. Depending on the magnitude of this property, the material may be classified as having a high surface energy or a low surface energy. This property depends generally on the composition of the substrate. For example, a substrate having a surface that contains a significant portion of polar, hydrophilic groups, such as hydroxyl groups, carboxylic acid groups, amine groups, and the like, generally exhibits a high surface energy. Conversely, a substrate having a surface that contains a significant portion of non-polar, hydrophobic groups, such as silicone, fluorinated groups, and the like, generally exhibits a low surface energy. It is readily known that when a polar liquid, such as water, is placed in contact with the surface of a substrate, the liquid will spontaneously wet the surface only if the surface tension of the liquid is lower than the surface energy of the substrate. Conversely, if the surface tension of the liquid is higher than the surface energy of the substrate, spontaneous wetting will not readily occur, and the liquid will remain pooled the surface of the substrate.<br>
As one might expect then, substrate surface energy modification has long been a major field of research for a variety of materials and for a multitude of reasons. For instance, it is often desirable to increase the surface energy of a substrate to facilitate its ability to absorb liquid or to increase the adhesion between a coating and a substrate. Practical examples include the chemical treatment of paper or plastic to enhance their wetting with printing inks and corona treatment of plastic to increase the adhesion between the plastic and another material, such as for the aluminum coating of Mylar® films in packaging applications. Textile substrates have also been modified to create substrates with high surface energy which results in a textile substrate that is hydrophilic and that exhibits improved comfort and stain release properties. As one example, the detergent industry has employed this technique for determining effective methods of cleaning various textile substrates.<br>
Surface energy modification has also been utilized in other coating applications, such as to produce non-stick surfaces exhibiting low surface energy through the application of Teflon™ to cookware and cooking utensils. Textile substrates have also been modified with low surface energy treatments in order to produce textile substrates that are hydrophobic and that exhibit repellent properties (such as for water repellent rainwear).<br>
It has commonly been observed that substrates treated with fluorinated polymers generally exhibit a contact angle of greater than 100 degrees with water. The advancing and receding contact angles are very similar. The major component of the surface energy of such treatments is dispersive. Substrates treated with dual functional repellents, such as disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 3,574,791 to Sherman et al., generally exhibit lower contact angles with water when compared with traditional fluorochemical repellents, and therefore, tend to exhibit lower repellency. The measured surface energy contains significant dispersive and polar components. Differences can usually be measured between the advancing and receding contact angles.<br>
In some instances, a measurable degree of hysteresis exists between the advancing and receding contact angle, indicating that the surface energy has changed in the presence of a liquid. Barring liquid adsorption, hysteresis is indicative that the surface energy has changed (kinetically or thermodynamically) in the presence of a liquid or environmental condition. This measurable degree of hysteresis provides further evidence that the substrate is autoadapting to its environment. One method for achieving ideal performance for textile applications would be obtained from a composition that provides high advancing contact angles (i.e., &gt; 90 degrees), exhibiting non-porous behavior, to impart stain resistance and provides low receding contact angles (i.e.90 degrees), exhibiting porous behavior, to<br>
part stain release to the substrate. Another method to achieve ideal performance for such applications would be obtained from a composition that imparts high advancing and high receding contact angles between a staining substance and the substrate, followed by low advancing and receding contact angles during exposure to a cleaning procedure.<br>
It would be desirable for a porous or stainable surface to exhibit high contact angles versus a variety of liquids to prevent adsorption or staining. It would also be desirable for such surfaces to adapt to a change in their environment, such as in a cleaning medium, to enhance removal of stains and soil. Other environmental conditions that could induce a change in the surface energy of a substrate include changes in temperature, moisture content, and other environmental factors. Highly desirable would be a surface that reversibly adapts to its environment, such that the surface is stain resistant and cleanable and retains this effect through a number of use cycles. In many end-use applications such as apparel, carpet, upholstery, and the like, appearance retention of the product is extremely important. While stain resistant treatments have been developed for each of these exemplary applications, it has been found, that much like stain resistant apparel treatments, such treatments have an adverse effect on subsequent cleaning. Thus, it would be highly desirable to develop soil and stain resistant textile substrates, regardless of the end-use application, that possess enhanced cleanability using appropriate cleaning techniques.<br>
With the development of XPS, SIMS, and other surface analytical techniques, it has become possible to detect certain chemical groups at the surface of materials. For instance, one can measure the concentration and depth profile of functional groups, such as CF3 moieties commonly found in fluoropolymer stain resist chemicals. Through appropriate sample preparation techniques, it is also possible to observe changes that take place on the surface of a substrate and that occur as a result of changes in the environment to which the substrate is exposed. For example, a substrate that is observed to contain predominately low surface energy groups, such as CF3 groups, under a first set of conditions can be shown to contain significant hydrophilic high surface energy groups, such as hydroxyl groups, at its surface under a different, second set of conditions. This polarity change typically allows the surface of the substrate to wet (i.e., absorb liquid), thereby enhancing stain release. As the substrate's environment is returned to the first set of conditions, one can observe, for example, the CF3 groups return to the substrate's surface, thus, returning the substrate to its low surface energy, stain resistant state.<br>
Some treatment compositions, such as polymers, possess other properties, such as glass transition temperature, which may influence the ultimate performance of the treated substrate. For instance a hard polymer that is characterized by a high glass transition temperature may provide increased protection against wetting, especially forcibly wetting.<br>
owever, this stiff, high glass transition polymer would likely require more work to adapt to changes in its environment due to less intra-polymer flexibility. In addition, the polymer molecular weight and addition of co-monomers may enhance wetting, adhesion, chemical reactivity, and durability for a variety of substrates as well.<br>
As should thus be evident, modification to provide a proper surface energy profile to impart simultaneous wash-durable oil repellency, water repellency, stain resistance, and stain release properties to a target substrate has been sought after for many years without success.<br>
The invention as described herein illustrates that certain combinations of chemicals and processing conditions permit and/or facilitate tailoring of the surface properties of a target substrate to obtain the desired balance of surface energy profiles to impart simultaneous repellency and stain release characteristics thereto. Furthermore, this unique combination of features has surprisingly been shown to be quite durable upon exposure to routine as well as industrial cleaning methods.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE PRIOR ART<br>
All U.S. Patents listed below are herein entirely incorporated by reference.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 2,841,573 to Ahlbrecht, et al. and U.S. Patent No. 3,645,990 to Raynolds disclose the use of fluoropolymers to impart oil and water resistance to textile substrates. While indeed providing a certain degree of stain resistance to the substrate, such treatments tended to possess limited durability against laundering. In addition, such polymers inhibited the release of stains, especially in circumstances when the stains wet the substrate by force or were allowed to dry on the substrate. In fact, stain removal was more difficult under these circumstances than if no treatment was applied to the substrate.<br>
In addition to fluoropolymers, silicones, waxes and various other compounds have been disclosed for imparting repellency to textiles and other substrates. With the exception of fluoropolymers, such compounds usually only provide water repellency and possess limited durability against laundering. These techniques are disclosed, for example, in U.S. Patent No. 4,421,796 to Burril, et al.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 3,574,791 to Sherman, et al. and U.S. Patent No. 3,896,088 to Raynolds, et al. disclose fluorinated oily stain release agents that impart some degree of water and oil repellency to a substrate without detrimentally impacting stain removal during laundering. Basically, these patents disclose polymers comprising both fluorinated, repellent moieties and hydrophilic moieties. It is claimed that such polymers exhibit a "flip-flop" mechanism that exposes the fluorinated segment in air to provide stain resistance and then exposes the hydrophilic segment in an aqueous environment to provide stain release. Such<br>
jBBiymers typically exhibit lower repellency than traditional fluorochemicals, especially lower water repellency, and they also suffer from a lack of durability to laundering.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 4,624,676 to White, et al. discloses unique silicone compounds, such<br>
as organosiloxanes, that impart stain release properties to a substrate. Durability is claimed<br>
 if these compounds are cross-linked. The compounds may self cross-link or can cross-link<br>
to the substrate, especially when appropriate catalysts are utilized. Such compounds may provide resistance to water based stains, but rarely to oil based stains.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 4,834,764 to Deiner, et al. discloses the use of cross-linking resins, such as methylol containing resins or blocked diisocyanates, to enhance the durability of fluoropolymers. Indeed, such resins increase the durability of fluoropolymers against laundering. These resins are added to the aqueous treatment containing the fluoropolymer. However, while indeed increasing the durability of the stain repellent properties, acceptable stain release does not result from this combination.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 4,540,765 to Koemm, et al. discloses fluorochemical repellents that possess greater durability to laundering than previous attempts have shown. Typically, such polymers contain, within the polymer, certain cross-linkable moieties. Examples of such cross-linkable moieties include methylol groups, blocked diisocyanate groups, epoxy groups, and the like. Such cross-linkable polymers indeed possess greater durability against laundering. As is the case with U. S. Patent No. 4,834,764 to Deiner, durability is improved, but acceptable stain release is not observed.<br>
U.S. Patent No. RE 28,914 to Marco discloses the use of carboxylated acrylic stain release polymers, fluoropolymers, and aminoplast resins to produce a cellulose-containing textile that possesses good stain repellency and improved stain release. However, this treatment only works with cellulose-containing textile substrates, which excludes most synthetic fibers.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 4,695,488 to Hisamoto, et al. discloses a stain release composition comprising a polymer that contains fluoroalkyl groups and alkoxy groups, a hydrophilic resin, and optionally, a water and oil repellent. This composition is claimed to impart durable stainproofing and stain release properties to a substrate. However, the level of water and oil repellency disclosed is rather low, and the stainproofing test disclosed is more indicative of stain resistance than of stain release.<br>
Even with so many attempts within this crowded field to provide the desired properties discussed above, there have been no wash-durable treatments imparting acceptable levels of simultaneous water repellency, oil repellency, and stain release characteristics to certain surfaces, in particular fabrics, and most notably, cotton-containing  fabrics disclosed, utilized, or suggested within this industry.    Thus, none of the above<br>
wsclosed references adequately discloses a surface that possesses durably high levels of water and oil repellency and acceptable levels of stain release for and/or on a variety of substrates. Market and consumer demands have shown that it would be desirable to render various substrates resistant to staining by as many common staining materials as possible and simultaneously render the substrates with improved stain removal characteristics by using routine cleaning procedures appropriate for the substrates. These cleaning procedures may include washing, such as in a home or industrial laundering machine, or spot cleaning procedures, such as used for upholstery. In addition, various other routine cleaning procedures, such as those employed for carpet cleaning and dry cleaning, are contemplated. Thus, in spite of a longstanding need and consumer demand for substrates having durable repellency and stain release characteristics, prior attempts have fallen short of such a goal.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Therefore, it is one object of the current invention to provide novel compositions that impart wash-durable oil repellency, water repellency, stain resistance, and stain release properties simultaneously to a substrate. It is also an object of the current invention to disclose a substrate that exhibits durably high levels of water and oil repellency and acceptable levels of stain release during and after standard laundering procedure, such as home and industrial washing, dry cleaning, or other typical methods of surface and/or substrate cleaning. It is yet another object of the current invention to disclose a method of treating a substrate to obtain durably high levels of oil and water repellency and acceptable stain release properties. Other objects of this invention include, without limitation, application of such novel compositions to certain fabric substrates to impart such wash-durable properties thereto either through typical immersion, padding, exhaustion, or other like application procedures, or through in-home dryer application methods.<br>
Accordingly, this invention encompasses a composition for altering the surface energy of a substrate in response to a change in the substrate's environment, said composition comprising: a high surface energy component, a low surface energy component, and a hydrophobic cross-linking component. More particularly, such an invention encompasses a composition for imparting durable repellency and stain release to a substrate, said composition comprising the resultant product of at least one hydrophilic stain release agent, at least one hydrophobic stain repellency agent cross-linked by at least one hydrophobic cross-linking agent.

pSIyester or cotton fabric substrates in terms of wash-durable and high oil repellency ratings, water repellency ratings, spray ratings, and stain release ratings as discussed below. In such situations, it should be evident that the composition is thus defined in terms of the properties it imparts to such specific test fabrics, and thus the invention does not require such fabrics to be present as part of the inventive composition.<br>
Other portions of this invention include specific fabric substrates, such as a fabric substrate comprised of at least 20% cotton fiber by weight of the total weight of said substrate, wherein said substrate exhibits an oil repellency rating of at least 4.0 when tested by AATCC Test Method 118 - 2000; a water repellency rating of at least 4.0 when tested by the 3M Water Repellency Test II (May, 1992); a spray rating of at least 70 when tested by AATCC Test Method 22-2000; and a stain release rating for corn oil and mineral oil of at least 4.0 when tested by AATCC Test Method 130 -2000; wherein said properties are exhibited after said test fabric has been laundered and dried in accordance with AATCC Test Method 130-2000 after 20 washes. Alternatively, and also encompassed herein, is a fabric substrate comprised of at least 20% cotton fiber by weight of the total weight of said substrate, wherein said substrate exhibits a change in surface energy in response to a change in the substrate's environment to the extent that upon exposure to a temperature of about 25 degrees C the measured surface energy is from less than about 20 millijoules per square meter, and upon exposure to a temperature of about 40 degrees C, the measured surface energy is greater than about 20 millijoules per square meter.<br>
Other fabric substrates are provided as well within this invention, including, without limitation, though potentially preferred, a fabric substrate comprising polyester fibers, wherein said substrate exhibits an oil repellency rating of at least 3.0 when tested by AATCC Test Method 118 - 2000; a water repellency rating of at least 3.0 when tested by the 3M Water Repellency Test II (May, 1992); a spray rating of at least 50 when tested by AATCC Test Method 22-2000; and a stain release rating for corn oil and mineral oil of at least 3.5 when tested by AATCC Test Method 130-2000; wherein said properties are exhibited after said test fabric has been laundered and dried in accordance with AATCC Test Method 130-2000 after 20 washes, as well as exhibiting the same surface energy modification properties as presented above pertaining to cotton fiber fabrics.<br>
Additionally encompassed within this invention is a method of imparting durable repellency and stain release to a substrate, the method comprising the steps of: (a)    providing a substrate;<br>
 (b)	coating the substrate with a composition comprised of a hydrophilic stain<br>
release agent, a hydrophobic stain repellency agent, and a hydro-phobic cross-linking agent;<br>
(c)	heating the substrate to remove substantially all of the excess liquid<br>
from the coated substrate; and<br>
(d)	optionally, further heating the coated substrate.<br>
Such inventive compositions, fabrics, and methods are discussed in greater detail below.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
Figure 1 is a graphical representation of XPS Surface Chemical Analysis for a microdenier polyester textile substrate treated with the inventive chemical composition of the present invention and for several microdenier polyester textile substrates treated with various competitive chemical compositions. The graph shows surface chemical analysis of fluorine, carbon, and oxygen before the substrate is exposed to a change in its environment (i.e., as received following treatment with chemistry), after the substrate is exposed to a change in its environment (i.e., substrate was wetted with water for 1 hour at 40°C, then vacuum dried), and after the substrate has been heated again (150°C for 5 minutes).<br>
Figure 2 is a graphical representation similar to Figure 1, except that the graph shows surface chemical analysis of fluorine, carbon, and oxygen before the substrate is exposed to a change in its environment (i.e., "as received" following treatment with chemistry) and after the substrate has been washed and dried 10 times.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Definitions<br>
"Water repellency" and "oil repellency" are generally defined as the ability of a substrate to block water and oil from penetrating into the substrate, respectively. For example, the substrate may be a textile substrate which is capable of blocking water and oil from penetrating into the fibers of the textile substrate.<br>
"Stain release" generally is defined as the degree to which a stained substrate approaches its original, unstained appearance as a result of a care procedure. As defined herein, high levels of stain resistance means an oil repellency rating of at least 3.0 when tested by AATCC Test Method 118 - 2000, a water repellency rating of at least 1.0 when tested by the 3M Water Repellency Test II (May, 1992), and a spray rating of at least 50 when tested by AATCC Test Method 22-2000. Acceptable stain release, as described  herein, means a rating for corn oil and mineral oil release of at least 3.0 when tested by<br>
Test Method 130 -2000.<br>
"Wash durability" is generally defined as the ability of a substrate to retain an acceptable level of a desired function through a reasonable number of standard laundering cycles. More specifically, durability, as described herein, is intended to describe a substrate that maintains adequate properties of stain resistance, water repellency, oil repellency, and spray rating after a minimum of 1 0 wash cycles, more preferably after 20 wash cycles, and most preferably after 50 wash cycles, in accordance with AATCC Test Method 130-2000. This substrate may be a textile substrate, such as, for example, a polyester textile fabric.<br>
The terms "fluorocarbons," "fluoropolymers," and "fluorochemicals" may be used interchangeably herein and each represents a polymeric material containing at least one fluorinated segment.<br>
The term "padded" indicates that a liquid coating was applied to a substrate by passing the substrate through a bath and subsequently through squeeze rollers.<br>
"Hydrophilic" is defined as having a strong affinity for or the ability to absorb water.<br>
"Hydrophobia" is defined as lacking affinity for or the ability to absorb water.<br>
"High surface energy" is defined as a surface energy equal to or greater than about 25 mJ/rn2 at about 25°C as calculated from Fowkes two component approach to solid surface energy (for additional information on the Fowkes equation, see Industrial and Engineering Chemistiy,1Q64, Chapters 12, 40, and 56 by F. M. Fowkes).<br>
"Low surface energy" is defined less than about 25mJ/m2 at about 25°C as calculated from Fowkes two component approach to solid surface energy.<br>
A high surface energy surface describes a surface, such as cotton, than can be spontaneously wet (
A low surface energy surface, such as Teflon™, does not spontaneously wet with water and maintains &gt; 90° contact angles with liquids containing higher surface tensions (approximately, &gt;25mN/m.)<br>
Compositions:<br>
The compositions useful for rendering a substrate with durable stain resistance and stain release are typically comprised of a hydrophilic stain release agent, a hydrophobic stain repellency agent, a hydrophobic cross-linking agent, and optionally, other additives to impart various desirable attributes to the substrate. Within the scope of this invention, new chemical compositions are contemplated wherein the relative amount and chain length of each of the aforementioned chemical agents may be optimized to achieve the desired level of performance for different target substrates within a single chemical composition.<br>
Hydrophilic stain release agents may include ethoxylated polyesters, sulfonated lUtyesters, ethoxylated nylons, carboxylated acrylics, cellulose ethers or esters, hydrolyzed polymaleic anhydride polymers, polyvinylalcohol polymers, polyacrylamide polymers, hydrophilic fluorinated stain release polymers, ethoxylated silicone polymers, polyoxyethylene polymers, polyoxyethylene-polyoxypropylene copolymers, and the like, or combinations thereof. Hydrophilic fluorinated stain release polymers may be preferred stain release agents. Potentially preferred, non-limiting, compounds of this type include UNIDYNE® TG-992, available from Daikin Corp., REPEARL® SR1100, available from Mitsubishi Corp., as well as ZONYL® 7910, available from DuPont. Treatment of a substrate with a hydrophilic stain release agent generally results in a surface that exhibits a high surface energy.<br>
Hydrophobic stain repellency agents include waxes, silicones, certain hydrophobic resins, fluoropolymers, and the like, or combinations thereof. Fluoropolymers may be preferred stain repellency agents. Potentially preferred, non-limiting, compounds of this type include REPEARL® F8025 and REPEARL® F-89, both available from Mitsubishi Corp., as well as ZONYL® 7713, available from DuPont. Treatment of a substrate with a hydrophobic stain repellency agent generally results in a surface that exhibits a low surface energy.<br>
Hydrophobic cross-linking agents include those cross-linking agents which are insoluble in water. More specifically, hydrophobic cross-linking agents may include monomers containing blocked isocyanates (such as blocked diisocyanates), polymers containing blocked isocyanates (such as blocked diisocyanates), epoxy containing compounds, and the like, or combinations thereof. Diisocyanate containing monomers or diisocyanate containing polymers may be the preferred cross-linking agents. However, monomers or polymers containing two or more blocked isocyanate compounds may be the most preferred cross-linking agents. One potentially preferred cross-linking agent is REPEARL® MF, also available from Mitsubishi Corp. Others include ARKOPHOB® DAN, available from Clariant, EPI-REZ® 5003 W55, available from Shell, and HYDROPHOBOL® XAN, available from DuPont.<br>
The total amount of the chemical composition applied to a substrate, as well as the proportions of each of the chemical agents comprising the chemical composition, may vary over a wide range. The total amount of chemical composition applied to a substrate will depend generally on the composition of the substrate, the level of durability required for a given end-use application, and the cost of the chemical composition. As a general guideline, the total amount of chemical solids applied to the substrate will be found in the range of about 0.25% to about 10.0% on weight of the substrate. More preferably, the total amount of chemical solids applied to the substrate may be found in the range of about 0.5% to about 5.0% on weight of the substrate. Typical solids proportions and concentration ratios of stain<br>
tepellency agent to stain release agent to cross-linking agent may be found in the range of about 10 : 1 : 0.1 and about 1 : 10 : 5, including all proportions and ratios that may be found within this range. Preferably, solids proportions and concentration ratios of stain repellency agent to stain release agent to cross-linking agent may be found in the range of about 5:1: 0.1 and about 1:5:2. Most preferably, solids proportions and concentration ratios of stain repellency agent to stain release agent to cross-linking agent may be 1 : 2 :1.<br>
The proportion of stain release agent to stain repellency agent to cross-linking agent may likewise be varied based on the relative importance of each property being modified. For example, higher levels of repeilency may be required for a given end-use application. As a result, the amount of repellency agent, relative to the amount of stain release agent, may be increased. Alternatively, higher levels of stain release may be deemed more important than high levels of stain repellency. In this instance, the amount of stain release agent may be increased, relative to the amount of stain repellency agent.<br>
For the purpose of producing a more economical chemical composition, the type of stain release agent, stain repellency agent, and cross-linking agent may be varied based on the end-use of the substrate treated with the chemical composition. For example, a treated substrate may be produced that is not expected to encounter oil based stains. Accordingly, more economical repellency agents, such as silicones, may be utilized as one component of the chemical composition.<br>
The substrate of the current invention may include glass, fiberglass, metal, films, paper, plastic, stone, brick, textiles, or combinations thereof. Glass, such as windows of buildings or automobiles may benefit from the current invention. In addition metal articles, such as bridges or automobile bodies may benefit from the current invention. Such items could resist staining by common soils and be cleaned by rain or the like. Films may include thermoplastic material, thermoset materials, or combinations thereof. Suitable thermoplastic or thermoset materials include polyolefin, polyester, polyamide, polyurethane, acrylic, silicone, melamine compounds, polyvinyl acetate, polyvinyl alcohol, nitrile rubber, ionomers, polyvinyl chloride, polyvinylidene chloride, chloroisoprene, or combinations thereof. The polyolefin may be polyethylene, polypropylene, ethylvinyl acetate, ethylmethyl acetate, or combinations thereof.<br>
Textile substrates comprise one potentially preferred, non-limiting embodiment of the current invention. The textile substrates may be of any known construction including a knit construction, a woven construction, a nonwoven construction, and the like, or combinations thereof. Textile substrates may have a fabric weight of between about 1 and about 55 ounces/yard2, and more preferably between about 2 and about 12 ounces/yard2. The material of the textile substrate can be synthetic fiber, natural fiber, man-made<br>
flier using natural constituents, inorganic fiber, glass fiber, or a blend of any of the foregoing. By way of example only, synthetic fibers may include polyester, acrylic, polyamide, polyolefin, polyaramid, polyurethane, or blends thereof. More specifically, polyester may include polyethylene terephthalate, polytrimethylene terephthalate, polybutylene terephthalate, polylactic acid, or combinations thereof. Polyamide may include nylon 6, nylon 6,6, or combinations thereof. Polyolefin may include polypropylene, polyethylene, or combinations thereof. Polyaramid may include poly-p-phenyleneteraphthalamide (i.e., Kevlar®), poly-m-phenyleneteraphthalamide (i.e., Nomex®), or combinations thereof. Exemplary natural fibers include wool, cotton, linen, ramie, jute, flax, silk, hemp, or blends thereof. Exemplary man-made materials using natural constituents include regenerated cellulose (i.e., rayon), lyocell, or blends thereof.<br>
The textile substrate may be formed from staple fiber, filament fiber, slit film fiber, or<br>
i combinations thereof. The fiber may be exposed to one or more texturing processes. The<br>
fiber may then be spun or otherwise combined into yarns, for example, by ring spinning, open-end spinning, air jet spinning, vortex spinning, or combinations thereof. Accordingly, the textile substrate will generally be comprised of interlaced fibers, interlaced yarns, loops, or combinations thereof.<br>
The textile substrate may be comprised of fibers or yarns of any size, including microdenier fibers or yarns (fibers or yarns having less than one denier per filament). The fibers or yarns may have deniers that range from less than about 1 denier per filament to about 2000 denier per filament or, more preferably, from less than about 1 denier per filament to about 500 denier per filament.<br>
Furthermore, the textile substrate may be partially or wholly comprised of multi-component or bi-component fibers or yarns in various configurations such as, for example, islands-in-the-sea, core and sheath, side-by-side, or pie configurations. Depending on the configuration of the bi-component or multi-component fibers or yarns, the fibers or yarns may be splittable along their length by chemical or mechanical action.<br>
The textile substrate may be printed or dyed, for example, to create aesthetically pleasing decorative designs on the substrate or to print informational messages on the substrate. The textile substrate may be colored by a variety of dyeing and/or printing techniques, such as high temperature jet dyeing with disperse dyes, thermosol dyeing, pad dyeing, transfer printing, screen printing, digital printing, ink jet printing, flexographic printing, or any other technique that is common in the art for comparable, equivalent, traditional textile products. In addition, the fibers or yarns comprising the textile substrate  of the current invention may be dyed by suitable methods prior to substrate formation, such a PT or instance, via package dyeing, solution dyeing, or beam dyeing, or they may be left undyed. In one embodiment, the textile substrate may be printed with solvent-based dyes rather than water based dyes. Solvent-based dyes may be more likely to uniformly wet the hydrophobic surfaces of the current invention:<br>
It is also contemplated that a textile substrate composite material may be formed by combining one or more layers of textile substrate together. For example, it may be desirable to combine several layers of an open weave textile substrate together to form a textile substrate composite material. The composite material may also include adhesive material or one or more layers of film. The composite material may then be treated with the chemical composition of the present invention to achieve a material that exhibits durable stain repellency and stain release performance characteristics. Alternatively, in yet another embodiment of the invention, the textile substrates comprising the composite material may be treated with the chemical composition before being combined into a composite material.<br>
In one potentially preferred embodiment of the current invention, a commodity item with a limited useful life may be treated with the minimum amount of chemical to achieve the required properties. More specifically, a substrate, such as a lightweight polyester disposable lab coat, may have only about 0.25% to about 1.5% of the chemical solids applied to the substrate. Conversely, in another potentially preferred embodiment of the invention, a premium item with a longer useful life may be treated with a near maximum amount of chemical to achieve the desired level of durability. More specifically, a substrate, such as a premium cotton apparel item or a polyester/cotton blend workwear uniform, may have about 1.0% to about 10.0% of the chemical solids applied to the substrate.<br>
Application of the stain release, stain repellent, and cross-linking agents to the textile substrate may be accomplished by a variety of application methods which include immersion coating, padding, spraying, foam coating, exhaustion techniques, or by any other technique whereby one can apply a controlled amount of a liquid suspension to a textile substrate. Employing one or more of these application techniques may allow the chemical to be applied to the textile substrate in a uniform manner.<br>
The chemical agents may be applied simultaneously or sequentially to the textile substrate. For example, a stain release agent, stain repellency agent, and a hydrophobic cross-linking agent may be mixed together in one solution and then simultaneously applied to the textile substrate by padding. After application of the chemical agents to the textile substrate, the treated substrate is generally exposed to a drying step to evaporate excess liquid, leaving the solid active components on the surface of the treated substrate. Drying can be accomplished by any technique typically used in manufacturing operations, such as dry heat from a tenter frame, microwave energy, infrared heating, steam, superheated<br>
stain release agent may be applied to the textile substrate, the substrate may be dried or left wet, and then a stain repellency agent and hydrophobic cross-linking agent may be applied 5     on top of the stain release agent, creating a layered, sequential chemical treatment on the surface of the textile substrate.<br>
It may be desirable to expose the treated substrate to an additional heating step to further enhance the performance or durability of the chemical agents. This step may be referred to as a curing step. By way of example, additional heating may (a) enable discreet 10 particles of the active components of the chemical agents to melt-flow together, resulting in uniform, cohesive film layers; (b) induce preferred alignment of certain segments of the chemical agents; (c) induce cross-linking reactions between the chemical agents or between the chemical agents and the substrate; or (d) combinations thereof.<br>
In many instances, for a textile substrate to perform satisfactorily, regardless of its<br>
   end-use application, attributes other than durable stain resistance and stain release are<br>
desirable.    Examples of such  attributes  include static protection, wrinkle resistance,<br>
shrinkage reduction  or elimination, desirable hand (or feel) requirements, dyefastness<br>
requirements, odor control, flammability requirements, resistance to dry soiling, and the like.<br>
Unexpectedly, a textile substrate treated according to the present invention actually exhibits<br>
     anti-cling and antistatic properties, which is a desirable feature of the substrate, for instance,<br>
during a garment cutting and sewing process.<br>
Accordingly, it may be desirable to treat the textile substrate with finishes containing chemicals such as antimicrobial agents, antibacterial agents, antifungal agents, flame retardants, UV inhibitors, antioxidants, coloring agents, lubricants, antistatic agents, 25 fragrances, and the like, or combinations thereof. Chemical application may be accomplished by immersion coating, padding, spraying, foam coating, or by any other technique whereby one can apply a controlled amount of a liquid suspension to a textile substrate. Employing one or more of these application techniques may allow the chemical to be applied to the textile substrate in a uniform manner. Many such chemical treatments can 30 be incorporated simultaneously with the chemical composition of the current invention, or such treatments may be carried out prior to treatment with the chemical composition of the current invention. It is also possible, using appropriate techniques, to apply many such chemical treatments after treatment with the chemical composition of the current invention.<br>
Additionally, the textile substrate may also be treated by mechanical finishing<br>
   techniques. For example, it may be desirable to expose the textile substrate tomechanical<br>
treatment such as calendering, embossing, etching, rainbow or hologram embossing, film or metal foil hologram embossing, fabric metallization, heat setting, hydroentanglement with<br>
inter or air, sanforizing, glazing, schreinering, sueding, sanding, emorizing, napping, shearing, tigering, decating, fabric patterning through the use of water, air, laser, or patterned rolls, and the like, or combinations thereof. These mechanical treatments typically provide desirable effects to the textile substrate which affect such properties as the appearance, strength, and/or hand of the fabric. Depending on which mechanical treatment is utilized, advantages may be obtained by treatment either before or after the chemistry of the current invention is applied. By way of example, benefits from sanding prior to chemical treatment and calendaring after chemical treatment may be envisioned.<br>
Within the scope of the current invention, it is also contemplated that asymmetric textile substrates may be created with surfaces having dual, functional attributes. For example, a textile substrate, having a first and a second surface, may be produced that possesses a first hydrophobic surface and a second hydrophilic surface. Such a dual functional textile substrate may be made, for example, by coating both surfaces of the textile substrate with a hydrophilic stain release agent and then coating the first surface of the substrate with a hydrophobic stain repellent agent and a hydrophobic cross-linking agent. Chemical application methods include any of those previously discussed, such as spray coating, foam coating, and the like. As a result, garments made in this manner may provide increased protection from environmental or chemical assault by repelling liquids on the first surface of the garment and, at the same time, provide increased user comfort by absorbing moisture, such as perspiration, on the second surface of the garment.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
Treatment Compositions and Applications Thereof to Fabric Substrates<br>
A) Fabric Application Procedures:<br>
All examples provided below were treated according to one of the following procedures and<br>
are noted accordingly.<br>
I) One step application procedure:<br>
1.	An approximately 14 inch by 18 inch piece of fabric was immersed into a bath<br>
containing the chemical composition comprised of the desired chemical<br>
agents.<br>
2.	Unless otherwise stated, all chemical percents (%) were % by weight based<br>
on the total weight of the bath prepared, and the balance remaining when chemical percents or grams of chemical are given is comprised of water.  In<br>
addition, the % chemical was based on the chemical as received from the manufacturer, such that if the composition contained 30% active component, then X% of this 30% composition was used.<br>
3.	After the fabric was completely wet, the fabric was removed from the<br>
treatment bath and run between squeeze rolls at about 40 psi to obtain a<br>
uniform pickup generally between about 50 and about 90%.<br>
4.	The fabric was pulled taught and pinned to a frame to retain the desired<br>
dimensions.<br>
5.	The pin frame was placed into a Despatch oven at a temperature of between<br>
about 300 and about 400 degrees F for between about 0.5 and about 5<br>
minutes to dry and heatset the fabric and to cure the finish.<br>
6.	Once removed from the oven, the fabric was removed from the pin frame and<br>
allowed to equilibrate at room temperature prior to testing.<br>
II) Two step application procedure:<br>
1.	The one step application procedure was repeated, except that rather than<br>
adding all the chemical agents to one chemical bath, one or more chemical<br>
agents comprising the chemical composition were separately applied to the<br>
fabric in a specified order as described below.<br>
2.	The fabric was immersed into a bath containing one or more of the chemical<br>
agents comprising the chemical composition.<br>
3.	After the fabric was completely wet, the fabric was removed from the bath and<br>
run between squeeze rollers as described  in the  one step  application<br>
procedure.<br>
4.	The fabric was dried at approximately 300 degrees F for about 5 minutes in a<br>
Despatch oven.<br>
5.	The fabric was then immersed into a fresh bath containing the remaining<br>
desired chemical agents comprising the chemical composition.<br>
6.	The fabric was then dried and cured as described in the one step application<br>
procedure.<br>
Ill) Alternative two step application procedure:<br>
1.  Approximately  100 grams of fabric were  placed   into  a Werner-Mathis laboratory dyeing machine.<br>
2.	Approximately 2 liters of water containing the desired chemicals were added<br>
to a jet dyeing machine.<br>
3.	The dyeing machine was closed, heated to about 130 degrees C, and held at<br>
this temperature for about 30 minutes. The pressure increased, as the water<br>
heated, to approximately 3 bars.<br>
4.	The dyeing machine was cooled to about 70 degrees C, and the treatment<br>
bath was drained.<br>
5.	The fabric was centrifuged in the dyeing machine to remove excess liquor.<br>
6.	While still wet, the fabric was immersed into a treatment bath containing the<br>
desired chemical agents.  Typically, the fabric was immersed for about 1 to<br>
about 10 seconds.<br>
7.	Once removed from this bath, the fabric was squeezed through pad rolls,<br>
placed onto a pin frame and dried and cured as in the one step application<br>
procedure described previously.<br>
IV) Postcure application procedure:<br>
1.  The one step application procedure was repeated, except rather than curing the hydrophobic cross-linking agent during one drying step, the fabric was dried and the chemical agents were cured as follows:<br>
(a)	the fabric was cured at the first stage at 300 degrees F for about 5<br>
minutes in a Despatch oven;<br>
(b)	the fabric was then exposed to steam in a hot head press set at 320<br>
degrees F as follows:<br>
i)   5 seconds at high pressure ii) 10 seconds head steam iii) 5 seconds buck steam iv) 5 seconds buck vacuum; and<br>
(c)	the fabric was then cured at 310 degrees F for 10 minutes (to simulate<br>
the process at garment manufacturers to cure the permanent press<br>
post-cure resin).<br>
V) Home dryer application procedure:<br>
1.	An 8 inch by 9 inch piece of fabric was cut for the procedure, and a 4.5 inch<br>
by 6 inch template was made and placed on top of the fabric.<br>
2.	A chemical composition was placed in a spray bottle and 2.5 grams of the<br>
solution was sprayed on the fabric through the template opening.<br>
3.	The treated fabric was placed in a Dryel® home dry cleaning bag obtained<br>
from a Dryel® home dry cleaning kit and put in a home dryer for about 30 minutes at high setting.<br>
4.	The fabric sample was removed from the dryer and conditioned at room<br>
temperature for between about 15 and about 45 minutes before testing.<br>

Example 13:<br>
A polyester and cotton blended fabric was treated with the inventive chemistry of the current invention according to the one step application procedure and postcure application procedures described previously. The fabric was obtained from Milliken &amp; Company of Spartanburg, South Carolina. The fabric was comprised of approximately 65% polyester yarn and approximately 35% cotton yarn. The warp yarns were comprised of 14.0/1 open end spun 65/35 polyester/cotton staple fibers with 3.30 twist multiple. The fill yarns were comprised of 12.0/1 open end spun 65/35 polyester/cotton staple fibers with 3.25 twist multiple. The polyester staple fibers for both the warp and fill yarns had a denier of approximately 1.2. The warp and fill yarns were woven together in a 3 by 1 left hand twill pattern having 100 warp yarns and 47 fill yarns per inch of fabric. The fabric was subsequently dyed via a continuous dyeing process and treated with the inventive chemistry. The finished fabric had a weight of about 8.5 ounces per square yard.<br>

Example 13F included the same chemical composition used in Example 13D, except<br>
the permanent press resin was used along with other auxiliaries, and the composition was not fully cured to allow permanent creases to be introduced into the fabric. This is known in the art as postcure resin treatment. However, the fabric was fully cured to simulate treatment at garment manufacturing facilities before testing. Similarly, Example 13G included the same chemical composition used in Example 13E, except that the permanent press resin was added with other auxiliaries, and the composition was not fully cured to allow permanent creases to be introduced into the garment using the postcure resin treatment. The fabric was fully cured before testing.<br>
Example 13H includes the same chemicals composition used in 13F, with the addition of a polyoxyethylene-polyoxypropylene copolymer (Pluronic F-68 from BASF). It was applied with the post cure application method. Example 131 includes the same chemicals composition used in 13F, with the addition of a polyoxyethylene-polyoxypropylene copolymer (Pluronic F-68 from BASF). It was also applied with the post cure application method.<br>
The treated fabrics were tested for water and oil repellency, spray rating and corn oil and mineral oil stain release by the methods described previously after 0 home washes ("AR" indicates "As Received"), 5 home washes, 10 home washes, 20 home washes, and 30 home washes. Test results are shown in Table VI.<br>
Example 14 (Comparatives):<br>
Example 13 was repeated, except that each chemical agent of the chemical composition was replaced with various competitive stain release and/or stain repellent chemicals.<br>
Additionally, the fabric used for Example 14D was of slightly different construction than the fabric described in Example 13. The fabric of 14D was also a 65/35 polyester/cotton blend fabric. However, the warp yarns were comprised of 16/1 open end spun 65/35 polyester/cotton staple fibers with 3.30 twist multiple. The fill yarns were comprised of 12.0/1 open end spun 65/35 polyester/cotton staple fibers. The polyester staple fibers for both the warp and fill yarns had a denier of approximately 1.2. The warp and fill yarns were woven together in a 2 by 1 left hand twill pattern having 88 warp yarns and 46 fill yarns per inch of fabric. The fabric was subsequently dyed via a continuous dyeing process and treated with the inventive chemistry. The finished fabric had a weight of about 7.2 ounces per square yard.<br>

Each of these exemplified substrates was then tested for various surface properties: C) Fabric Surface Analysis Procedures and Test Results:<br>
I) Description of Followed Test Methods:<br>
a) The Home Wash Procedure undertaken below to test for wash durability was conducted in accordance with AATCC Test Method 130 - 2000, using wash procedure 1 •(105 ° F wash) and Tide® Quick Dissolving Powder detergent.<br>
The Industrial Wash Procedure was conducted in accordance with a standard procedure used by many large industrial laundry facilities. The procedure is identified as one used for colored blends of textile substrates and uses the following procedural steps <br>
(Table Remove)<br>
The load size for the industrial wash procedure was determined to be at 80% of machine capacity (28 Ib load in a 35 Ib machine). Total wash cycle time was about 33 minutes. The time shown, for example, as "16/1" indicates that the wash time was 16 minutes and the drain time was 1 minute. The chemicals used for washing were obtained from Washing Systems Inc. The chemicals were Choice MP, a concentrated non-ionic surfactant, Horizon, a silicated phosphate builder, Express, an alkali compound, and Sour, an acidic compound. The pH range of the wash cycle was maintained in a range of between about 10.2 and 10.8.<br>
b)	The Spray Rating Test was conducted in accordance with AATCC (American<br>
Association of Textile Chemists and Colorists) Test Method 22-2000. The rating scale is as<br>
follows:<br>
100 - No sticking or wetting of upper surface<br>
90 - Slight random sticking or wetting of upper surface<br>
80 - Wetting of upper surface at spray points<br>
70 - Partial wetting of whole of upper surface<br>
50 - Complete wetting of whole of upper surface<br>
0 - Complete wetting of whole upper and lower surfaces.<br>
c)	Stain Release was determined using AATCC Test Method 130-2000.     The<br>
staining agents used in the Stain Release tests were corn oil (CO) and mineral oil (Ml). The<br>
rating scale is 1 - 5, with "1" indicating the poorest degree of stain removal, and "5"<br>
indicating the best degree of stain removal.   Generally, a rating of about 3.0 is the minimum<br>
acceptable stain level for normal wear and use.<br>
d)	Water Repellency was tested according to the 3M Water Repellency Test II (May,<br>
1992).   The rating scale is 0 - 10, with "0" indicating the poorest degree of repellency<br>
(substrates having higher surface energy) and "10" indicating the best degree of repellency<br>
(substrates having lower surface energy). The 3M Water Repellency Test scale is: <br>
(Table Remove)<br>
e)	Oil Repellency was tested according to the AATCC Test Method 118-2000. The<br>
rating scale is 0 - 8, with "0" indicating the poorest degree of repellency (substrates having<br>
higher surface energy) and "8" indicating the best degree of repellency (substrates having<br>
lower surface energy). The oil repellency scale is:<br>
•	0 is Nujol™ Mineral Oil (the substrates wets with the oil)<br>
•	1 is Nujol™ Mineral Oil<br>

•	6 is n-decane<br>
•	7 is n-octane<br>
•	8 is n-heptane<br>
f)	Kawabata Hand Testing<br>
A variety of characteristics were measured using the Kawabata Evaluation System ("Kawabata System"). The Kawabata System was developed by Dr. Sueo Kawabata, Professor of Polymer Chemistry at Kyoto University in Japan, as a scientific means to measure, in an objective and reproducible way, the "hand" of textile fabrics. This is achieved by measuring basic mechanical properties that have been correlated with aesthetic properties relating to hand (e.g. smoothness, fullness, stiffness, softness, flexibility, and crispness), using a set of four highly specialized measuring devices that were developed specifically for use with the Kawabata System. These devices are as follows:<br>
Kawabata Tensile and Shear Tester (KES FB1)<br>
Kawabata Pure Bending Tester (KES FB2)<br>
Kawabata Compression Tester (KES FB3)<br>
Kawabata Surface Tester (KES FB4)<br>
KES FB1 through 3 are manufactured by the Kato Iron Works Col, Ltd., Div. Of Instrumentation, Kyoto, Japan. KES FB4 (Kawabata Surface Tester) is manufactured by the Kato Tekko Co., Ltd., Div. Of Instrumentation, Kyoto, Japan.   In each case, the measurements were performed according to the standard Kawabata Test Procedures, with four 8-inch X 8-inch samples of each type of fabric being tested, and the results averaged. Care was taken to avoid folding, wrinkling, stressing, or otherwise handling the samples in a way that would deform the sample. The fabrics were tested in their as-manufactured form (i.e. they had not undergone subsequent launderings.) The die used to cut each sample was aligned with the yarns in the fabric to improve the accuracy of the measurements. i) Shear Measurements<br>
The testing equipment was set up according to the instructions in the Kawabata manual. The Kawabata shear tester (KES FB1) was allowed to warm up for at least 15 minutes before being calibrated. The tester was set up as follows: Sensitivity: 2 and X5 Sample width: 20cm Shear weight: 195g Tensile Rate: .2 mm/s Elongation Sensitivity: 25 mm<br>
The shear test measures the resistive forces when the fabric is given a constant tensile force and is subjected to a shear deformation in the direction perpendicular to the constant tensile force.<br>
Mean Shear Stiffness (G) [gf/(cm-deg)]. Mean shear stiffness was measured in each of the warp and filling directions. A lower value for shear stiffness is indicative of a more supple hand.<br>
Four samples were taken in each of the warp and filling directions, and are listed below. ii) Bending Measurements<br>
Bending Stiffness (B) - A lower value means a fabric is less stiff. Four samples were taken in each of the warp and filling directions. Hi) Compression Analysis<br>
The testing equipment was set up according to the instructions in the Kawabata manual. The Kawabata Compression Tester (KES FB3) was allowed to warm up for at least 15 minutes before being calibrated. The tester was set up as follows:<br>
Sensitivity: 2andX5 Stroke: 5mm<br>
Compression Rate: 1 mm/50s Sample Size: 20X20 cm<br>
The compression test measured the resistive forces experienced by a plunger having a certain surface area as it moves alternately toward and away from a fabric sample in a direction perpendicular to the fabric. The test ultimately measures the work done in compressing the fabric (forward direction) to a preset maximum force and the work done while decompressing the fabric (reverse direction). Percent compressibility at 0.5 grams (COMPOS) The higher the measurement, the more compressible the fabric.<br>
Maximum Thickness (TMAX)- Thickness [mm] at maximum pressure (nominal is 50 gf/cm2). A higher TMAX indicates a loftier fabric.<br>
Minimum Thickness (TMIN) Thickness at 0.5g/sq cm. More is generally considered to be better. A higher TMIN indicates a loftier fabric.<br>
Minimum Density - Density at TMIN (DMIN). Less is generally considered to be better) Tmin[g/cm3]<br>
Maximum Density - Density at TMAX (DMAX)- Tmax[g/cm3] A lower value is generally considered to be better.<br>
Compressional Work per Unit Area (WC)   Energy to compress fabric to 50 gf/cm2[gf-cm/cm2]. More is generally considered to be better.<br>
Decompressional Work per Unit Area (WC') This is an indication of the resilience of the fabric. A larger number indicates more resilience (i.e. a springier hand), which is generally considered to be better. iv) Surface Analysis<br>
The testing equipment was set up according to the instructions in the Kawabata Manual. The Kawabata Surface Tester (KES FB4) was allowed to warm up for at least 15 minutes before being calibrated. The tester was set up as follows Sensitivity 1: 2 and X5 Sensitivity 2: 2andX5 Tension Weight: 480 g Surface Roughness Weight: 10 g Sample Size: 20X20 cm<br>
The surface test measures frictional properties and geometric roughness properties of the surface of the fabric.<br>
Coefficient of Friction- (MIU) Mean coefficient of friction [dimensionless].<br>
This was tested in each of the warp and filling directions. A higher value indicates that the surface consists of more fiber ends and loops, which gives the fabric a soft, fuzzy hand. Four samples were taken in each of the warp and filling directions, and are listed below.<br>
Surface roughness (SMD) Mean deviation of the displacement of contactor normal to surface [microns]. Indicative of how rough the surface of the fabric is. A lower value indicates that a fabric surface has more fiber ends and loops that give a fabric a softer, more comfortable hand. Four samples were taken in each of the warp and filling directions, and are listed below.<br>
g) The Dry Cleaning Test Method was conducted by placing an approximately 6 inch by 6 inch piece of fabric into a 1 quart jar with 250 ml perchloroethylene. The jar was shaken vigorously for 5 minutes. The fabric was then removed and allowed to air dry for a minimum of 8 hours. This Method if hereinafter referred to as "The Dry Cleaning Method".<br>
h) The Static Test Method was conducted by placing an approximately 3 inch by 8 inch piece of fabric onto the laboratory bench. The sample was briskly rubbed (in one direction) 20 times with a fresh paper towel. A Simco FM300 Electrostatic Fieldmeter was immediately placed approximately 1 inch away from fabric, and the button was pressed to make the measurement. The result obtained was recorded in kilovolts. To obtain results after conditioning the fabric, the fabric sample was placed overnight into an environmentally controlled room at 70 degrees F and 65% relative humidity. The measurement was repeated on the conditioned sample.<br>
i) Advancing and Receding Contact Angles were measured using the following two instruments and procedures:<br>
/)         Tensiometer Test Method: Tensiometry as used herein, involves a gravimetric measurement of the forces of interaction as a solid is contacted with a test liquid (Wilhelmy method). These forces of interaction are a dynamic measurement and reflect the interactions of the entire immersed article (wetted length). Forces are measured as the article is advanced into and out of a test liquid. From these measurements, both advancing and receding contact angles, respectively, can be calculated (Wilhelmy equation) in an indirect manner. //)        Goniometer Test Method: Goniometry, as used herein, involves the optical observation of a sessile drop of test liquids on a solid substrate. Tangent angles are measured for each test liquid providing the direct measurement of an "advanced" (static) contact angle. These angles only reflect the average forces imparted from the area under the drop (footprint) and not the bulk of the article. These angle calculations can be used to determine surface energies and corresponding<br>
components.<br>
Both Goniometer and Tensiometer Test Methods achieve similar results with the goniometer being of a small area and a static measurement, j) X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) was used to perform the surface<br>
chemical analysis shown in Example 28 and in Figures 1 and 2. XPS is described as<br>
follows:<br>
Since the first use of XPS to probe polymer surfaces, as described in The Journal of Polymer Science and Polymer Chemistry Ed. (1977, vol. 15, p.2843) by D.T. Clark and H.R. Thomas, it has become a standard, quantitative tool for their characterization. The energy-analyzed electrons, photoemitted during irradiation of a solid sample by monochromatic X-rays, exhibit sharp peaks which correspond to the binding energies of core-level electrons in the sample. The peaks of these binding energies can be used to identify the chemical constituents in the specimen.<br>
The mean free path of electrons in solids is very short (X ~ 2.3 nm). For reference, see Macromolecules (1988, vol. 21, p.2166) by W.S. Bhatia, D.H. Pan, and J.T. Koberstein. The effective sampling depth, Z, of XPS can be calculated by Z = 3X cosG, where 0 is the angle between the surface normal and the emitted electron path, to the analyzer. So the maximum depth that can be probed is about 7 nm at 9 = 0. For typical atomic components of polymers, C, N, and O, optimized XPS can detect compositions of 0.2 atom percent. XPS is also very sensitive to F and Si. Such quantitative information is very useful in understanding polymer surface behaviors.<br>
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was employed here to examine the chemical composition of the modified textile surfaces and, furthermore, to evaluate the surface chemical composition change under different environmental situations. XPS spectra were obtained using a Perkin-Elmer Model 5400 XPS spectrometer with a Mg Koc X-ray source (1253.6 eV), operated at 300 W and 14 kV DC, with an emission current of 25 mA. The spot size was 1.0 x 3.0 mm. Photoelectrons were analyzed in a hemispherical analyzer using a position-sensitive detector.<br>

The results of Example 2 illustrate the versatility of the inventive chemistry in having the ability to maximize stain repellency performance (i.e., spray rating improves with decreasing amounts of Unidyne TG-992) at the expense of stain release performance (i.e., mineral oil release decreases with smaller amounts of Unidyne TG-992) and, conversely, the ability to maximize stain release performance (i.e., mineral oil release is higher with greater amounts of Unidyne TG-992) at the expense of stain repellency performance (spray rating is lower with greater amounts of Unidyne TG-992). This versatility allows the inventive chemistry to be tailored for specific end-use applications such as rainwear, wherein water repellency may be more desirable, or workwear, wherein stain release may be more desirable.<br>

III) Further Analyses Through Modifications of Test Methods<br>
Example 20:<br>
To illustrate that the inventive chemistry additionally provides improved oil and water repellency, improved stain release, and improved spray rating on a variety of textile substrate types, several other textile substrates were treated with the inventive chemistry using the one step application procedure and compared against the same textile substrate in an untreated state.<br>
The chemical composition used for these textile substrates was as follows:<br>
1 % Repearl F-89, a repellent agent;<br>
5% Unidyne TG-992, a stain release agent; and<br>
2% Witcobond W-293, a cross-linking agent. Example 20A:<br>
A 100% acetate textile substrate made by Milliken &amp; Company was used to test for oil and water repellency, spray rating, and corn and mineral oil stain release by methods previously described. The acetate was constructed of a 191 by 50 satin weave pattern and comprised of 75/19 denier bright (as opposed to dull) acetate warp yarns and 150/38 denier bright fill yarns. The acetate had a wet pickup of the chemical composition on the substrate of about 80%.<br>
Example 20B:<br>
A 100% acrylic textile substrate purchased from a fabric store was used to test for oil and water repellency, spray rating, and corn and mineral oil stain release by methods previously described. The acrylic had a felt construction and exhibited a wet pickup of the chemical composition on the substrate of about 250%.<br>
Example 20C:<br>
A 100% wool textile substrate purchased from a fabric store was used to test for oil and water repellency, spray rating, and corn and mineral oil stain release by methods previously described. The wool had a plain weave construction and exhibited a wet pickup of the chemical composition on the substrate of about 80%.<br>
Example 20D:<br>
A 100% silk textile substrate purchased from a fabric store was used to test for oil and water repellency, spray rating, and corn and mineral oil stain release by methods previously described. The silk was raw silk having a woven construction similar to a taffeta fabric. The wet pickup of the chemical composition on the substrate was about 100%.<br>
Test results for are shown in Table XI. The results for Example 20A illustrate that the treated acetate, when compared with untreated acetate, exhibits improved oil and water repellency. The results of Example 20B illustrate that the treated acrylic, when compared with untreated acrylic, exhibits improved oil repellency. The results of Example 20C illustrate that the treated wool, when compared with untreated wool, exhibits improved oil repellency and improved corn and mineral oil stain release. The results of Example 20D illustrate that the treated silk, when compared with untreated silk, exhibits improved oil and water<br>
rapenency and improved spray rating. <br>

Example 21:<br>
Example 1 was repeated, except several other common laundry detergents were used in place of the Quick Dissolving Tide®. The detergents used were:<br>
Example 21 A:   Mountain Spring Tide®<br>
Example 21B:   Cheer®<br>
Example 21C:   Tide Free Liquid®<br>
Example 21D:   Era®<br>
Example 21E:   All®<br>
Example 21F:   Downy® (in the washer) and Quick Dissolving Tide®<br>
Example 21G:  Bounce® (in the dryer) and Quick Dissolving Tide® Test results for are shown in Table XII. The results illustrate that good stain release and acceptable levels of repellency and spray rating are obtained using a variety of different detergents and fabric softeners on the polyester substrate. <br>

Example 22:<br>
In order to determine how the inventive chemistry affects the hand (or feel) of the textile substrate, several textile substrates were treated as described below and were then subjected to testing using the Kawabata Evaluation System. The substrates tested and chemical compositions used are as follows:<br>
Example 22A:   Example 1 was repeated.<br>
Example 22B:   Example 6B was repeated<br>
Example 22C:  The textile substrate described in Example 1 was untreated<br>
as a control.<br>
Test results are shown in Table XIII. Lower values for Bending Stiffness are indicative of a more supple hand. The results illustrate that the inventive chemistry does not detrimentally affect the hand of the polyester fabric and actually may slightly improve the hand when tested using Kawabata measurements.<br>
(Table Remove)<br>
Example 23:<br>
Durability to dry cleaning was tested on microdenier polyester fabric treated with the inventive chemical composition, as well as with several competitive chemical compositions according to the previously described dry cleaning procedure.   The treated fabrics were tested for oil and water repellency and spray rating before any dry cleaning cycles ("as received"), after 1 dry cleaning cycle, after 5 dry cleaning cycles, and after 5 dry cleaning cycles and ironing. The substrates tested were as follows:<br>
Example 23A:   Example 1 was repeated<br>
Example 23B:   Example 6B was repeated<br>
Example 23C:   Example 6C was repeated<br>
Test results are shown in Table XIV. The results illustrate that the inventive chemistry is able to withstand the process of dry cleaning and the process of dry cleaning and ironing and still maintain some level of durability through at least 5 dry cleaning cycles.<br>
(Table Remove)<br>
Another test was performed to determine the air permeability of microdenier polyester textile substrate treated with the inventive chemistry of the current invention. The treated polyester fabric was compared with untreated polyester fabric and with the same fabric having a competitive chemical composition applied to it. The test was performed in accordance with ASTM Test Method D737-96 with air pressure at 125 Pa (Pascals), and the results are given in "cfm" (cubic feet per minute) units. The textile substrates tested and the chemistry used are as follows:<br>
Example 24A:   Example 1 was repeated<br>
Example 24B:   Example 6B was repeated<br>
Example 24C:   The textile substrate described in Example 1 was untreated<br>
as a control.<br>
Test results are shown in Table XV. The results illustrate that air permeability was not significantly affected by treatment with the inventive chemistry. The results further show that air permeability was better with the inventive chemistry when compare with the same fabric treated with competitive chemistry.<br>
(Table Remove)<br>
Example 25:<br>
Another test was performed to determine the effect the inventive chemistry has on static charge for microdenier polyester textile substrate. The treated polyester fabric was compared with untreated polyester fabric and with the same fabric having a competitive chemical composition applied to it. The test was performed according to the previously described procedure. The results are given in "kV" (kilovolts) before home washing ("AR" means as received"), after 1 home wash cycle, after 5 home wash cycles, and after 5 home wash cycles and conditioning the substrate to 70°F and 65% relative humidity ("RH"). "NR" indicates that the static charge exceeded the meter's capability to measure the charge. The<br>
teawe substrates tested and the chemistry used are as follows:<br>
Example 25A:   Example 1 was repeated<br>
Example 25B:   Example 6B was repeated<br>
Example 25C:  The textile  substrate described  in  Example  1  was left<br>
untreated as a control.<br>
Test results are shown in Table XVI. The results illustrate that after 5 washes with conditioning the polyester substrate treated with inventive chemistry actually reduces the static charge on the substrate. The results further show that the polyester substrate treated with inventive chemistry created less static charge than the same fabric treated with competitive chemistry with no washes and after 5 washes with conditioning. Additionally, the polyester substrate treated with inventive chemistry created less static charge than the untreated polyester substrate after 1 wash and after 5 washes with conditioning.<br>
Furthermore, all the results, except for the polyester substrate treated with inventive chemistry after 5 washes and conditioning, measured some degree of static charge, which indicates that the substrates exhibit undesirable static cling properties. The only sample that did not exhibit any static cling was the polyester substrate treated with inventive chemistry after 5 washes and conditioning. Since durable antistatic and anticling protection is difficult to achieve on polyester substrates, especially microdenier polyester substrates, these results show yet another advantage of using the inventive chemistry of the current invention on various substrates.<br>

Example 26:<br>
Advancing and receding contact angles were measured for a polyester substrate treated with various inventive and competitive chemical compositions using the Goniometer and Tensiometer Test Methods previously described. The chemical compositions were as follows: <br>
Example 26A:   Example 1 was repeated on a polyester film and on the<br>
polyester/cotton blend fabric described in Example 13, and the contact angles<br>
were measured<br>
Example 26B:   Example 26A was repeated on the polyester film, with only<br>
the stain release chemical agent, 4.5% Unidyne TG-992, and the contact<br>
angles were measured.<br>
Example 26C:   Example 26A was repeated on the polyester film, with only<br>
the stain repellent chemical agent, 1.5% Repearl F8025, and the contact<br>
angles were measured.<br>
Example 26D:   Example 6B was repeated on the rnicrodenier polyester<br>
fabric, and the contact angles were measured.<br>
Example 26E:   Example 6C was repeated on a polyester film and on the<br>
polyester/cotton blend fabric of Example 13, and the contact angles were<br>
measured.<br>
Example 26F:   The substrate described in Example 26A (polyester film) was<br>
left untreated as a control, and the contact angles were measured. Test results are shown in Table XVII. The results indicate improved stain resistance and improved stain release is expected for the chemical composition of the current invention when compared with traditional fluorochemical repellents (Ex. 26B). The results also illustrate that improved aqueous stain resistance is expected when compared with newer repellents (Ex. 26C). Further, the results also show the advancing contact angle is dominated by Repearl F8025 (the stain repellent chemical agent), and the receding contact angle is dominated by Unidyne TG-992 (the release chemical agent), thereby providing further support of the chemical composition auto adapting to changes in its environment. Finally, the results show that the composition of the current invention yields similar results on both natural and synthetic fibers, as well as on films in addition to textile substrates. <br>

Example 27:<br>
Using the contact and receding angle data shown in Example 26, surface energy was calculated, both at 25°C and 40°C, for the microdenier polyester substrate treated with various inventive and competitive chemical compositions. The results are given in -units of millijoules per square meter. The surface energy at 40° C was determined, using the same measurement technique, but the sample was soaked in water for 1 hour at 40°C and vacuum dried, prior to testing. The chemical compositions were as follows:<br>
Exarrlple 27A:   Example  1  was repeated, and the surface energy was<br>
determined.<br>
Example 27B:   Example 1 was repeated, with only the stain release chemical<br>
agent, 4.5% Unidyne TG-992, and the surface energy was determined.<br>
Example 27C:  Example   1   was  repeated,  with  only  the  stain  repellent<br>
chemical   agent,   1.5%   Repearl   F8025,   and   the   surface   energy  was<br>
determined.<br>
Example 27D:  Example 6D was repeated, and the surface energy was<br>
determined.<br>
Example 27E:   Example 6E was repeated, and the surface energy was<br>
determined.<br>
Example 27F:   Example 61 was repeated, and the  surface energy was<br>
determined.<br>
Test results are shown in Table XVIII. The results reflect the unique surface energy change obtained from the composition of the current invention, as a result of a change in the environment. The inventive chemical composition of the current invention is the only composition that exhibits the change from a low energy surface to a high energy surface as a result of environmental effects. This surface energy change is representative of the requirements of a durable stain repellent and stain release composition or treated surface.<br>

Example 28:<br>
Surface chemical analysis for fluorine, carbon, and oxygen was performed on microdenier polyester fabric treated with the inventive chemistry of the current invention and<br><br>
62 with various competitive chemistry using XPS analytical techniques.<br>
compositions applied to the fabric were as follows:<br>
Example 28A:   Example 6C was repeated.<br>
Example 28B:   Example 1 was repeated.<br>
Example 28C:   Example 61 was repeated.<br>
Example 28D:   Example 6D was repeated.<br>
Example 28E:   Example 6B was repeated. Test results for Example 28 are shown in Table XIX and in Figures 1-3.<br><br>
The chemical<br><br>
(Table Remove)<br>
Detailed Description of the Drawing:<br>
As seen in Table XIX and Figure 1, the fluorine containing segment and the oxygen containing segment at the surface remain relatively constant for the treatment used for example 28A, regardless of the samples exposure to water or heat. However, the fluorine decreases, and the oxygen increases for the treatment of Example 28B (inventive chemistry) when the sample is exposed to water and returns to essentially the original values after heating the sample. Without being bound by theory, this may indicate that, in the presence<br>
urwdusi and especially at 40°C, the ethylene oxide segment of Unidyne TG-992 is hydrated and swells sufficiently to predominate over the fluorinated segment. This may explain the surface energy changes that are shown to occur, as well as the excellent stain repellency and stain release of the chemical composition of the current invention. Upon subsequent heating, the polymer resumes its original configuration.<br>
Figure 1 further illustrates that Example 28A and 28E do not show the environmental response to water at 40°C as shown for Example 28B. Examples 28C and 28D show a similar environmental response to Example 28B (inventive chemistry). However, as seen in Figure 2, considerably more fluorine is lost from Example 28C and 28D than from Example 28B (inventive chemistry) after 10 home washes. This is especially true for example 28D and indicates a lack of durability for these treatments.<br>
IV) Further Analysis of Different Fabric Types<br>
Example 29:<br>
A suit fabric comprised of about 65% polyester fiber and about 35% wool fiber was tested using the inventive chemistry and competitive chemistry according to the Home Dryer Application Procedure previously described (and generally exemplified within U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,630,828, 5, 591,236, and/or 5,951,716). The treated fabrics were tested for corn oil stain release, water repellency, and oil repellency as described previously. An untreated control fabric was also tested. The chemical compositions used for treatment were as follows:<br>
Example 29A:   An untreated piece of fabric (control).<br>
Example 29B:   5% Unidyne TG-992<br>
Example 29C:   5% Unidyne TG-992<br>
1% RepearlF-89<br>
Test results are shown in Table XX. The results illustrate that stain release and stain repellent chemistry can be added to a textile substrate using the Home Dryer Application Procedure to provide corn oil stain release and water and oil repellency properties. The results further show the versatility and ease with which such chemistry may be applied to a substrate to obtain such stain release and repellency characteristics. <br>
(Table Remove)<br><br>
Accordingly,  although it has  been  known to use fluorocarbon  polymers and<br>
nyarophilic stain release polymers, together or separately, in order to obtain water and oil repellency and stain release performance characteristics on a substrate, it has proven difficult to obtain those characteristics simultaneously and with lasting durability following exposure to repeated home and industrial wash cycles. Because the polymers have a tendency to work against each other and to wash off the substrate during laundering, it has been surprising to find stain repellent chemical agents, stain release chemical agents, and hydrophobic cross-linking agents that work well together as shown in Examples 1 through 18. The concentration of the respective chemical agents which comprise the chemical composition used to treat a substrate, in combination with the unique ratio of the chemical agents to each other, and the careful selection of chemical agents, all seem to play a significant role in determining the success of the process and product, particularly with respect to durability.<br>
In one or more preferred embodiments of the invention, the chemical composition may be applied to the substrate in a one step application process, a two step application process, or in an alternative two step application process as described previously. Indeed, as shown in the Examples, polyamides, polyaramids, polyesters, cottons, and polyester and cotton blend substrates, when treated according to the present invention, have all yielded improved performance with respect to durable water and oil repellency and durable stain release characteristics.<br>
Accordingly, the treated substrate of the present invention has many applicable uses for incorporation into articles of apparel, such as outerwear (e.g., rainwear), workwear (e.g., uniforms), fashion apparel (e.g., shirts, pants, and other garments); drapery; napery (e.g., table linens and napkins); residential upholstery; commercial upholstery; automotive upholstery; carpeting; outdoor fabric (e.g., outdoor furniture, awnings, boat covers, and grill covers), and any other article wherein it is desirable to manufacture a substrate having durable water and oil repellency and durable stain release characteristics.<br>
These and other modifications and variations to the present invention may be practiced by those of ordinary skill in the art, without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. Furthermore, those of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that the foregoing description is by way of example only, and is not intended to limit the scope of the invention described in the appended claims.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
