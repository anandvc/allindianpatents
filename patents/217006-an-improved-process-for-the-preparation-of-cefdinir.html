				<td>Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to an improved process for the preparation of cephalosporin antibiotic. More particularly, the present invention relates to a process for the preparation of cefdinir of the formula (I).<br><br>
wherein R1 represents hydrogen, carboxylic acid ester or easily cleavable carboxylic protecting group.<br>
The present invention also provides new salts of compound of formula (VIII) and a process for the preparation of cefdinir using the new salts.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Cefdinir is a third generation cephalosporin antibiotic for oral administration and has a broader antibacterial spectrum over the general gram positive and gram negative bacteria, especially against Streptococci, than other antibiotics for oral administration.<br>
In view of the vital antibiotic activities of cefdinir of the formula (I), various methods of preparation were reported. US patent No. 4,559,334 discloses a process for the preparation of cefdinir as depicted in the Scheme I.<br><br><br>
Scheme I<br>
In the disclosed process, 7-amino-3-vinyl-3-cephem-4-carboxylic acid ester is acylated with the reactive ester of haloacylacetic acid, which was converted to its oxime, followed by cyclization with thiourea and deprotection of the ester group to afford cefdinir. The cyclization step suffers from poor yield and affords brownish color of the thiazole derivative, which subsequently affords cefdinir, but quality and yield were inferior. Further, owing to the fact that the expensive 7-amino-3-vinyl-3-cephem-4-carboxylic acid is carried through four steps, cost of producing cefdinir is high.<br>
In our US patent No. 6,388,070 disclosed a process for preparing a compound of formula (I), wherein, R1 represents H, trityl, etc., R2 represents H, phenyl, etc., R3 represents H or C1 -C7 alkyl; R4 is CH3, CH=CH, etc., R5 is H or a salt or a carboxylic protecting group; R6 is H or trimethylsilyl; comprising acylating the compound of formula (II) with compound of formula (VII) in the presence of an organic solvent, organic base and a silylating agent at a temperature in the range of -<br><br>
Scheme II<br>
US patent No. 6,093,814 discloses a process for the preparation of cefdinir and its intermediate as represented in the Scheme III:<br><br><br>
Scheme III<br>
In this process 7-amino-3-vinyl-3-cephem-4-carboxylic acid is condensed with 2-benzothiazolyl (z)-(2-aminothiazol-4-yl)-2-(z)-(trityloxyimino)acetate in N,N-dimethyl acetamide, and the product obtained was treated with p-toluenesulfonic acid in the presence of a mixture of diethyl ether and methanol to get crystalline 7-[(2-aminothiazol-4-yl)-2-(z)-(trityloxyimino)acetamido]-3-vinyl-3-cephem-4-carboxylic acid.pTSA.2DMAc solvate. This process utilizes highly volatile, low-boiling and therefore industrially-not-preferred solvent, diethyl ether, for crystallizing out the above solvate. In addition, the quantity of the low-boiling solvent used is also very high ranging from 60-100 volumes, thereby adding hazard to the operations. Added to this is the fact that the recovery of these solvents from their mixture is not straight-forward.<br>
US patent No. 6,350,869 discloses the purification of impure cefdinir through the preparation of N,N-dicyclohexylamine salt of 7-[2-aminothiazol-4-yl-2-(z)-hydroxyimino acetamido]-3-vinyl-3-cephem-4-carboxylic acid and subsequent hydrolysis to get pure cefdinir.   This process requires the preparation of crude<br><br>
cefdinir, conversion to N,N-dicyclohexylamine salt and then hydrolysis of the salt to get pure cefdinir, and therefore the overall yield is not attractive.<br>
US patent No. 6,350,869 also emphasizes that cefdinir is unstable in the presence of other amines, with which, it gets heavily degraded. In addition, Yoshihiko Okamoto et al. (J. Pharm. Sci. Vol. 8S(9), 976, 1996) report that cefdinir may be unstable under basic environment.<br>
Considering the foregoing limitations, we undertook an investigation in our lab to identify a process, which involves (i) less number of steps, (ii) the direct isolation of cefdinir, with out the need to prepare crude cefdinir in an additional step and (iii) a simple method of crystallizing out the solvate of the formula (II), without employing low-boiling solvents/mixture of solvents. This would permit commercializing the production of high-pure cefdinir with industrial-friendly solvent, which can further be recovered for recycling.<br>
Objectives of the Invention<br>
The main objective of the present invention is to provide a commercially viable process for the preparation of cefdinir of the formula (I), which would be easy to implement on manufacturing scale.<br>
Another objective of the present invention is to provide new salts of formula (VIII), which are insoluble and stable throughout the process of producing the cefdinir cephalosporin and a process for the preparation of cefdinir using these new salts.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides an improved process for the preparation of cefdinir of the formula (I)<br><br><br>
