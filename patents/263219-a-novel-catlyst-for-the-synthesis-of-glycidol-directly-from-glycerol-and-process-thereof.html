The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which is<br>
to be performed.<br><br><br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is related to heterogeneous solid base catalyst comprising supported mixed oxide wherein said heterogeneous solid base catalyst has specific surface area in the range 10 m /g to 600 m /g. A process of producing glycidol directly from glycerol in a single step comprises of reacting glycerol and dimethyl carbonate in a solvent by using a heterogeneous reusable solid base catalyst. This catalyst is highly active, separable, regenerable and reusable, providing high conversion and selectivity towards glycidol.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Heterogeneous solid catalyst are always been great area of interest to researcher. Thus many efforts have been made to design of better heterogeneous solid catalyst with high specific area which can be easily separable, regenerable and reusable. Many inventors claim for better heterogeneous catalyst with various support but they have their own drawbacks for different reaction system.<br>
Numerous catalytic reactions have been identified in past few years, in which solid base catalysts have proved to be capable of producing interesting results in terms of performance.<br>
The catalytic properties of solid base catalysts are mainly associated with the quantity and the strength of the base sites existing on the surface.<br>
United States Patent 7341973 relates to solid base catalysts consisting of an amorphous material obtained from silica or alumina gel containing an alkaline, earth-alkaline or transition metal (M), characterized by a molar ratio between metal (M) and Si or Al ranging from 30:1 to 0.0001:1, a surface area ranging from 100 to 600 m2/g, an overall pore volume ranging from 0.1 to 1.1 ml/g. Said catalysts can be conveniently used in base catalysis reactions.<br><br>
US patent application 20070189955, claims for catalyst composition based on cerium oxide and zirconium oxide in an atomic proportion Ce/Zr of at least 1, and has a reducibility rate of at least 70% and a surface area of at least 15 m2/g.<br>
Glycidol has the advantage of being a current commercial, albeit specialty product. High cost and large market demand for glycidol indicates the need for the convenient route of its synthesis. There is no known process which gives glycidol in high state of purity with minimum energy requirement and minimum waste.<br>
The increasing production of glycerol and growth of bio-diesel plants has resulted in an abundant supply of glycerol leading to its price decline. Glycerol carbonate can split off carbon dioxide yielding glycidol. It is well known that glycidol has a big impact on the environment. Glycidol is reasonably anticipated to be a human carcinogen based on sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity in experimental animals, Glycidol is soluble in water and in case of leakage can be harmful to fish.<br>
Glycidol also known as 2-(Hydroxymethyl)oxirane, allyl alcohol oxide, 3-hydroxypropylene oxide, 2,3-epoxy-l-propanol, oxirane methanol, 3-hydroxy-l,2-epoxypropane having boiling point of 166 °C is incompatible with strong acids or bases, salts (e.g., aluminum chloride, iron(III) chloride, tin(IV) chloride) or metals (e.g., copper, zinc).<br>
Glycidol is used as an additive for oil and synthetic hydraulic fluids, and as a diluent in some epoxy resins. Glycidol also falls into the generalized category of chiral epoxides. These chiral epoxides or glycidols can be used as reagents in a number of pharmaceutical and fine chemical applications that includes pesticides and herbicides, flavors and fragrances, chiral polymers, and liquid crystals. It is used as a stabilizer for natural oils and vinyl polymers, demulsifier, dye-leveling agent. It is used in surface coatings, sanitary chemicals and sterilizing milk of magnesia, as a gelatin agent in solid propellants.<br>
Only few routes of synthesis of glycidol are described in the literature. The main routes for the synthesis of glycidol are as follows:<br><br>
1.	Epoxidation of Allyl alcohol<br>
2.	Decarboxylation of Glycerol carbonate<br>
3.	Dehydrochlorination of chloroglycerol using base catalyst<br>
Japanese patent WO 2007145278 discloses the process of producing glycidol from glycerol carbonate which was in turn obtained from the reaction of glycerol and urea in the presence of zinc sulphate as a catalyst. The glycerol carbonate obtained by further distillation was then subjected to sulphate heating at 180 °C temp for 3 h at 400 psi in the presence of anhydrous sodium to obtain glycidol.<br>
In the paper "Studies in Surface Science and Catalysis (2001), 135, 3806-3813", the catalytic synthesis of glycidol from glycerol carbonate in presence of zeolite A is reported. The reaction takes place in two steps: cationic/anionic ring opening-dimerization of glycerol carbonate and cyclization of the dimer to glycidol and CO2. Zeolite A is bifunctional (acidic and basic) and catalyzes both steps. The yield of glycidol is approximately 72% with zeolite A and glycerol, compared with 25% in absence of catalyst and initiator. Continuous feeding of glycerol carbonate to maintain a high concentration gives 86% yield of glycidol.<br>
According to Chemical Papers (2001), 55(3), 185-191 on "Influence of acetone and acetonitrile content on the epoxidation of allyl alcohol with hydrogen peroxide over TS-1 catalyst", a decrease in acetone content results in increasing selectivity for glycerol synthesis and a decrease in selectivity for glycidol and allyl glycidyl ether. Higher selectivity for glycidol and allyl glycidyl ether is achieved when the process is run in the presence of acetone as a solvent.<br>
Russian patent RU 2130452 reports the preparation of glycidol by treatment of glycerol monochlorohydrin with basic reagent in organic solvent.<br>
According to patent WO 9840371 by ONIDOL, titled "Method and apparatus for producing an epoxide, notably glycidol" discloses the synthesis of glycidol by heating glycerol carbonate at 165° C under reduced pressure to produce ring contraction with elimination of CO2. The reaction<br><br>
is effected in a solid/liquid system in the presence of a polyol and a solid catalyst consisting of a type-A zeolite or y-alumina.<br>
US Patent 3954815 discloses glycidol (I) and glycerol (by hydrolysis of I) synthesis via epoxidation of allyl alcohol with 5-40% AcOOH in anhydrous inert solvents, especially diisobutyl ketone. Also according to JP 49025643 for oxidation of allylic alcohols, glycidol and glycerin are prepared by oxidation of allyl alcohol with H2O2 in the presence of catalysts and a phenolic substance.<br>
According to SU 288742 and Journal of the American Chemical Society (1930), 52 1521-1527, glycidol is prepared by treating glycerol monochlorohydrin. DE 1226554 reports the preparation of glycidol from glycerol monochlorohydrin using K2CO3 as a base.<br>
GB 971633 discloses the process for preparation of glycerol by passing aqueous solutions of acrolein-derived halohydrins (0.05%) through a strongly basic anion exchange resin at 20-60° and at atmospheric pressure to yield glycidol and then passing the glycidol solution through a catalytic amount of a cation exchange resin to yield a diluted solution of relatively pure glycerol.<br>
Thermal decomposition of glyceryl carbonates as reported in Journal of American Chemical Society (1952), 74 2100-2101 mentions convenient method for preparing glycidol in 60-85% yield from glycerol.<br>
In the process of production of glycidol from glycerol, the glycerol carbonate is first been prepared in pure form by either of the reported process and then decarboxylated. This is highly cost effective and not economic for industrial scale production of glycidol.<br>
There is no direct process for the conversion of glycerol to glycidol in a single step which will have enormous implications for glycidol and its family of products. In fact the reverse is reported extensively in which glycidol is hydrated to give glycerol. This process in the present invention relates to the preparation of glycidol.<br><br>

* Selectivity	of glycidol	is calculated based on glycerol conversion	<br>
Example 11-14:				<br>
A series of reactions for synthesizing glycidol are carried out using 50 ml glass reactor, in which 5 gm glycerol, 14.66 gm dimethyl carbonate and 10 ml N-methyl pyrrolidone are mixed and heated to specified temperature (mentioned in Table 3). 0.5 gm (10% wt of glycerol) catalyst is<br><br>
added to the reaction mixture at this temperature. The temperatures of the reaction are varied in these examples. After the specified reaction time, reaction mixture is filtered to remove catalyst and then analyzed by Gas Chromatography equipped with FID detector using BP-20 capillary column.<br>
