				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
HYDROPHILIC POLYSILOXANE MACROMONOMER, AND PRODUCTION AND USE OF THE<br>
SAME<br>
Technical Field [0001]<br>
The present invention relates to novel hydrophilic polysiloxane macromonomers, methods of production thereof, and ophthalmic lenses employing the hydrophilic polysiloxane macromonomers and, in particular, to a contact lens. In more detail, the present invention relates to a contact lens having both of oxygen permeability and a hydrophilic property, and raw materials therefor.<br>
Background Art [0002]<br>
High oxygen permeability is demanded for ophthalmic lenses, in particular, for contact lenses, which need supply of oxygen, necessary for maintaining corneal health statuses, from an air medium. In recent years, contact lenses, in which siloxane monomers as raw materials are employed for improving oxygen permeability, have been developed.<br>
High hydrophilic properties as well as oxygen permeability are also demanded for contact lenses. Contact lenses with high hydrophilic properties are said to generally have good wear comfort and be comfortably wearable for long time. Hydrophilic monomers are commonly used as raw materials in order to improve hydrophilic property of contact lenses. [0003]<br>
To produce a contact lens having both of high oxygen permeability and a high hydrophilic property, it is necessary to use both of a siloxane monomer and a hydrophilic monomer as raw materials; however, since a siloxane monomer has a high hydrophobic property in general and thus has poor compatibility with a hydrophilic monomer, phase separation occurs, which makes it difficult to produce transparent contact lenses.  In order to solve this problem,<br>
hydrophilized siloxane monomers have been developed. [0004}<br>
For example, hydrophilic contact lenses produced from polysiloxane containing hydrophilic side chains are disclosed in Patent Document 1 and Patent Document 2, wherein compounds containing polyether groups, hydroxyl groups, amide groups, and quaternary amine groups as hydrophilic side chains are selected; however, since the specifically disclosed polysiloxane contains comparatively many hydrophilic side chains which have a comparatively low molecular weight, per molecule, a balance between a hydrophilic property and oxygen permeability is inadequate, and it was difficult to use the polysiloxane as a raw material for an ophthalmic lens with high oxygen permeability and a high hydrophilic property. [0005]<br>
A plastic molding article produced from plastic which includes a compound having a group with a polymerizable double bond, a hydroxyl group, an organosiloxane group, and an amide group as a polymerization ingredient is disclosed in Patent Document 3. The polymerization ingredient allows production of the plastic molding article with high transparency, high oxygen permeability, good water wettability, and good mechanical properties. However, since the specifically disclosed compound had short siloxane chains, effective oxygen permeability was not obtained. In addition, since the compound had only one polymerizable functional group per molecule, adequate strength was precluded. [0006]<br>
A hydrogel soft contact lens comprising a hydrophilic siloxane monomer and a copolymer thereof is disclosed in Patent Document 4, Patent Document 5 and Patent Document 6, wherein the hydrophilic siloxane monomers contain main chains, in which polymerizable groups and polysiloxane chains are bound through urethane or urea groups, including fluorine-substituted hydrocarbon and polyoxyalkylene groups as side chains.  Since hydrophilic siloxane monomers containing urethane or urea groups have high intermolecular forces, copolymers thereof are also prone to have a comparatively high modulus of elasticity, and there were cases where flexibility greatly<br>
affecting the wear comfort of contact lenses was lost.<br>

Disclosure of Invention<br>
Problems to be Solved by the Invention<br>
[0007]<br>
The present invention addresses problems of providing an ophthalmic lens, in particular, contact lens, which has both of oxygen permeability and a hydrophilic property; and of providing a novel hydrophilic polysiloxane macromonomer, which can be used as a raw material thereof, and a method of production of the macromonomer.<br>
Means for Solving Problems<br>
[0008]<br>
As a result of extensive research, use of a hydrophilic polysiloxane macromonomer as a raw material, containing a polysiloxane main chain including polyoxyethylenes as hydrophilic side chains, was found to be effective at pursuing both of the high oxygen permeability and high hydrophilic property of an ophthalmic lens, in particular, a contact lens. In addition, oxygen permeability and hydrophilic property were found to be greatly affected by the length of the polysiloxane main chain, the length of the hydrophilic polyoxyethylene side chains and the number of the included side chains, and the invention was thus accomplished. A hydrophilic polysiloxane macromonomer, in which both terminals of a main chain have polymerizable functional groups and the polymerizable functional groups and polysiloxane of the main chain are bound through ester groups, was further found to be effective at adequately controlling strength and a modulus of elasticity which greatly affect the usability and wear comfort of a contact lens.<br>
[0009]<br>
Specifically, a hydrophilic polysiloxane macromonomer presented in general formula (1) is exemplified:<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
wherein Rx is selected from either hydrogen or a methyl group; R2 is selected from either of hydrogen or a C1-4 hydrocarbon group; m represents an integer of from 0 to 10; n represents an integer of from 4 to 100; a and b represent integers of 1 or more; a+b is equal to 20-500; b/(a+b) is equal to 0.01-0.22; and the configuration of siloxane units includes a random configuration.<br>
It is to be noted that "the configuration of siloxane units includes a random configuration" means that the siloxane units containing polyoxyethylene as hydrophilic side chains and siloxane units excluding the polyoxyethylene side chains may be arranged randomly or in block form, or random and block configurations may coexist in one molecule. A rate between random and block configurations may be also optional, for example, only a random or block configuration may be included in one molecule, or the random and block configurations may be included at an optional rate. [0010]<br>
The present invention also relates to hydrophilic polysiloxane macromonomers, wherein a and b, presented in the general formula (1), represent 25-200 and 2-20, respectively; to hydrophilic polysiloxane macromonomers, wherein n, presented in the general formula (1), represents 5-20; and to hydrophilic polysiloxane macromonomers, wherein a and b, presented in the general formula (1) , represent 25-160 and 3-10, respectively, and n represents 5-15. [0011]<br>
Furthermore, the present invention also relates to methods of producing hydrophilic polysiloxane macromonomers represented by general formula (1), which is obtained via polysiloxane represented by general formula (2) as an intermediate:<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
wherein Rx is selected from either hydrogen or a methyl group; m represents an integer of from 0 to 10; c and d represent integers of 1 or more; c+d is equal to 20-500; d/(c+d) is equal to 0.01-0.22; and the configuration of siloxane units includes a random configuration. [0012]<br>
In more detail, the present invention also relates to a method in which the step of producing the polysiloxane intermediate represented by general formula (2) is carried out by ring-opening polymerization of cyclic dimethylsiloxane, cyclic siloxane having hydrosilane (Si-H), and siloxane having (meth) acrylic groups at both terminals using an acid catalyst and by stopping the ring-opening polymerization by neutralization reaction with a basic aqueous solution. [0013]<br>
The present invention also relates to a method of producing the hydrophilic polysiloxane macromonomers represented by general formula (1) comprising hydrosilylation reaction of the intermediate represented by general formula (2) with polyethylene glycol allyl ether represented by general formula (3):<br>
(Formula Removed) <br><br>
wherein R2 is selected from either hydrogen or a C1-4 hydrocarbon group; and n represents an integer of from 4 to 100.<br>
The hydrosilylation reaction may uses, as a catalyst therefor, a platinum-containing catalyst, and the production method may further comprise  the  step  of  washing  the  hydrophilic  polysiloxane macromonomer with a solvent after the reaction. [0014]<br>
Furthermore, the present invention also relates to<br>
homopolymers of the above-mentioned hydrophilic polysiloxane macromonomers, or to copolymers copolymer!zed the above-mentioned hydrophilic polysiloxane macromonomers with one or more polymerizable monomers, ophthalmic lens materials employing these polymers, and ophthalmic lenses and contact lenses employing these materials.<br>
Effects of the Invention [0015]<br>
Because a hydrophilic polysiloxane macromonomer of the present invention has good compatibility with polymerizable mixtures containing a hydrophilic monomer, a transparent copolymer is afforded, and high oxygen permeability can be also maintained. The hydrophilic polysiloxane macromonomer utilizing these characteristics is useful as an ophthalmic lens material with a high hydrophilic property and high oxygen permeability. It is to be noted that ophthalmic lenses, but are not limited in particular, are preferably understood to be lenses fitted to the anterior eye segment for purposes such as vision correction, test and therapy, and preferably include, e.g., an intraocular lens, a corneal lens, and a contact lens.<br>

FIG. 2 is an infrared absorption chart of a hydrophilic polysiloxane macromonomer A.<br>
Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention [0017]<br>
The present invention is specifically described below.<br>
In the aforementioned general formula (1), representing the raw material of an ophthalmic lens with both of high oxygen permeability and a high hydrophilic property, in particular, a contact lens, a combination of a+b, determining the length of a polysiloxane main chain, b/(a+b), determining the percentage content of hydrophilic side chains, and the number n of bound polyoxyethylenes<br>
which are the hydrophilic side chains, is important, wherein a+b is equal to 20-500, b/(a+b) is equal to 0. 01-0.22, and n represents 4-100; preferably a+b is equal to 27-220, b/(a+b) is equal to 0.01-0.15, and n represents 5-20; more preferably, a+b is equal to 28-160, b/(a+b) is equal to 0.01-0.10, and n represents 5-15. Furthermore, a and b per specific hydrophilic polysiloxane macromonomer molecule are preferably equal to 25-200 and 2-20, respectively; more preferably, 25-160 and 3-10, respectively, allowing a balance between oxygen permeability and a hydrophilic property. [0018]<br>
Various methods of synthesizing a hydrophilic polysiloxane macromonomer disclosed in the present invention are conceivable and include, for example, a method as described below, via a polysiloxane intermediate represented by general formula (2) shown below.<br>
Specifically, ring-opening polymerization of a mixture of cyclic dimethylsiloxane, cyclic siloxane having hydrosilane (Si-H), and disiloxane having (meth)acrylic groups at both terminals is carried out using an acid catalyst, such as sulfuric acid, trifluoromethanesulfonic acid or acid clay, to provide a polysiloxane intermediate containing (meth)acrylic groups at both terminals as shown in general formula (2):<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
wherein R1 is selected from either hydrogen or a methyl group; m represents an integer of from 0 to 10; c and d represent integers of 1 or more; c+d is equal to 20-500; d/(c+d) is equal to 0.01-0.22; and the configuration of siloxane units includes a random configuration. In general formula (2), the ratio and total number of c and d may be optionally controlled by varying the compounding ratio of cyclic dimethylsiloxane, cyclic siloxane having hydrosilane (Si-H), and disiloxane having (meth)acrylic groups at both terminals. A polysiloxane intermediate obtained in this manner has no single molecular weight but has a molecular weight distribution as in case<br>
of a typical synthetic polymer. [0019]<br>
A synthesis method is described in more detail. After ring-opening polymerization of a mixture of cyclic dimethylsiloxane, cyclic siloxane having hydrosilane (Si-H), and siloxane having (meth)acrylic groups at both terminals using an acid catalyst such as sulfuric acid, trifluoromethanesulfonic acid or acid clay, preferably trifluoromethanesulfonic acid having a high acidity and a high catalytic activity, the reaction can be stopped by addition of a basic aqueous solution. The basic aqueous solution preferably has a pH of more than 7 but 14 or less, more preferably a weakly basic pH of more than 7 but 9 or less which inhibits a side reaction from occurring.<br>
As a reaction solvent, no solvent may be used in the reaction, or a solvent that does not inhibit the ring-opening polymerization by an acid catalyst may be used. Reaction solvents include, for example, tetrahydrofuran, dioxan, hexane, cyclohexane, heptane, cycloheptane, chloroform, dichloromethane, dichloroethane, dimethoxyethane, toluene, benzene, xylene, diethyl ether, diisoprpyl ether, acetone, and methyl ethyl ketone. Among them, the solvents excluding hetero elements, such as oxygen and nitrogen, which suppress the activity of an acid catalyst, are preferred.<br>
Reaction temperature may be in the range of 0-150°C, preferably 20-100°C, more preferably 25-80°C. The higher reaction temperature results in acceleration of the reaction, but unfavorably allows occurrence of a side reaction due to polymerization of, e.g., (meth)acrylic groups.<br>
A polymerization inhibitor, e.g., HQ (hydroquinone), BHT (2,6-di-t-butyl-4-methylphenol) or MQ (p-methoxyphenol), may be previously added into a reaction system to inhibit a side reaction due to radical polymerization of, e.g., (meth)acrylic groups during ring-opening polymerization. [0020]<br>
An example of a method of producing a polysiloxane intermediate represented by the aforementioned general formula (2) includes a method comprising the step of synthesizing a compound represented by<br>
general formula (6) as an intermediate, as shown in the following reaction formula (b):<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
wherein R1 is selected from either hydrogen or a methyl group; m represents an integer of from 0 to 10; p and q represent integers of from 3 to 10, preferably from 3 to 5; c and d represent integers of 1 or more; c+d is equal to 20-500; d/(c+d) is equal to 0.01-0.22; e represents an integer of from 0 to 500; and the configuration of siloxane units includes a random configuration. [0021]<br>
Siloxane having (meth)acrylic groups at both terminals, represented by general formula (6) is commercially available as TSL9706 (manufactured by Momentive), and also may be synthesized by following methods, for example. [0022]<br>
A first example of a method of synthesizing siloxane of general formula (6) is exhibited in reaction formulas (c) and (d) described below. That is, the example includes a method comprising carrying out hydrosilylation reaction between siloxane having SiH groups at both terminals represented by general formula (9) and polyoxyalkylene having a terminal hydroxyl group and an allyl group represented by general formula (10) to generate a polyoxyalkylene-polysiloxane block copolymer with both terminal hydroxyl groups represented by general formula (7) in the reaction formula (c) ; and then reacting the block copolymer (7) obtained in the above-mentioned reaction with (meth)acrylic acid represented by general formula (8) or a reactive derivative thereof to synthesize siloxane having (meth) acrylic groups<br>
at both terminals represented by general formula (6) in the following reaction formula (d):<br><br>
wherein Rx  is selected from either hydrogen or a methyl group; m represents an integer of from 0 to 10; and e represents an integer<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
of from 0 to 500. [0023]<br>
Another example of a method of synthesizing siloxane of general formula (6) is exhibited in reaction formulas (e) and (f) as described below. That is, the other example includes a method comprising reacting polyoxyalkylene having a terminal hydroxyl group and an allyl group represented by general formula (10) with (meth)acrylic acid represented by general formula (8) or a reactive derivative thereof to generate polyoxyalkylene having a terminal allyl group and a (meth)acrylic group represented by general formula (11) in reaction formula (e); and then carrying out hydrosilylation reaction of (11) obtained in the above-mentioned reaction with siloxane having SiH groups at both terminals represented by general formula (9) to synthesize siloxane having (meth)acrylic groups at both terminals represented by general formula (6) in the following reaction formula (f):<br><br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
wherein R1 is selected from either hydrogen or a methyl group; m represents an integer of from 0 to 10; and e represents an integer of from 0 to 500.<br>
[0024]<br>
Next, a hydrophilic: polysiloxane macromonomer represented by general formula (1) may be obtained by an addition of polyethylene glycol allyl ether to the intermediate presented in general formula<br>
(2)utilizing a so-called hydrosilylation reaction, which is an addition reaction to hydrosilane using a transition metal catalyst such as chloroplatinic acid. The hydrophilic polysiloxane macromonomer also becomes a compound having a molecular weight distribution as well as a polysiloxane intermediate thereof.<br>
[0025]<br>
For polyethylene glycol allyl ether as used herein, various compounds may be used, among them compounds represented by the following general formula (3) are preferable. In the formula (3), R2 is selected from either hydrogen or a C1-4 hydrocarbon group; n represents an integer of from 4 to 100, particularly preferably 5 to 20, further preferably 5 to 15; and R2 is preferably hydrogen or a methyl group.<br>
In addition, when carrying out a reaction, it is important to add a larger amount of polyethylene glycol allyl ether than a stoichiometric ratio, allowing inhibition of a side reaction due to an unreacted SiH group, e.g., inhibition of hydrolysis to obtain a macromonomer of stable quality. In addition, surplus polyethylene glycol allyl ether can be easily removed by a purification method with a solvent as described below, after the reaction.<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
 [0026]<br>
Transition metal catalysts for hydrosilylation reaction include, e.g., ruthenium, rhodium, iridium, osmium, and platinum; preferably a platinum-containing catalyst; more preferably hexachloroplatinic acid, 1,3-divinyltetramethyldisiloxane platinum complex, platinum carried on activated carbon, and platinum (IV)oxide; most preferably hexachloroplatinic acid exhibiting a high catalytic activity.<br>
[0027]<br>
For a reaction solvent, a solvent that does not inhibit hydrosilylation reaction and react itself may be used. Reaction solvents include, for example, isopropanol, tetrahydrofuran, dioxan, hexane, cyclohexane, heptane, cycloheptane, chloroform, dichloromethane, dichloroethane, dimethoxyethane, benzene, toluene, and xylene.  In particular, when reacting polyethylene glycol allyl ether in general formula (3) in which R2 is hydrogen, a method of protecting a hydroxyl group to inhibit side reaction between hydroxyl and SiH groups may be used, more preferably, a method of adding a buffer agent is particularly easily used.  For example, potassium acetate is particularly useful. [0028]<br>
Reaction temperature may be in the range of 0-150°C, preferably 25-100°C, more preferably 35-85°C. The higher reaction temperature results in acceleration of the reaction, but unfavorably allows occurrence of a side reaction due to polymerization of, e.g., (meth)acrylic groups. [0029]<br>
A washing operation with a solvent may be performed as a purification method following hydrosilylation reaction. A hydrophilic polysiloxane macromonomer of interest can be precipitated and separated by dissolution of a crude product in a first solvent, followed by addition of a second solvent. The first solvent as used herein refers to a solvent in which a macromonomer represented by general formula (1) is easily dissolved, and the second solvent refers to a solvent in which the macromonomer represented by general formula (1) is difficult to dissolve and polyethylene glycol allyl ether used is dissolved.<br>
First solvents include methanol, ethanol, propanol, isopropanol, butanol, isobutanol, acetone, tetrahydrofuran, dioxan, chloroform, dichloromethane, dichloroethane, and ethylene glycol. Second solvents include, e.g., water.<br>
A macromonomer of interest can be obtained by distilling out a solvent after purification. In this context, an appropriate amount of polymerization inhibitor, such as HQ (hydroquinone), BHT<br>
(2,6-di-t-butyl-4-methylphenol) or MQ (p-methoxyphenol), may be also previously added in order to prevent gelation. [0030]<br>
In addition to the production method via the intermediate represented by general formula (2) , there is also a method of producing the hydrophilic polysiloxane macromonomer by production of an polyoxyalkylene group-containing intermediate having reactive groups such as hydroxyl groups at both terminals, followed by introduction of a polymerizable group such as a (meth)acrylic group. However, since this method has difficult purification and needs extended steps, the production method via the intermediate represented by general formula (2), as disclosed herein, is industrially useful and preferable. [0031]<br>
Also, the present invention is to disclose a polymer of hydrophilic polysiloxane macromonomer alone, presented in the general formula (1), or a copolymer obtained by copolymerizing said hydrophilic polysiloxane macromonomer with one or more polymerizable monomers, and an ophthalmic lens material. Ophthalmic lenses to which the present invention is applicable include an intraocular lens and a corneal lens, and further preferably, contact lenses. [0032]<br>
A copolymerizable monomer will now be described below. Any monomer may be used if it is copolymerizable in the present invention, in particular, hydrophilic monomers are useful. That is because the hydrophilic monomers improve the surface hydrophilic properties of hydrophilic polysiloxane macromonomer copolymers and vary water content of the copolymer. Examples of copolymerizable monomers include a hydroxyl group-containing monomer such as 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate, 2-hydroxypropyl methacrylate, 2-hydroxybutyl acrylate, 4-hydroxybutyl acrylate or glycerol methacrylate; a hydroxyl group-containing monomer having a fluorine-containing substituent such as 3-(1,1,2,2-tetrafluoroethoxy)-2-hydroxypropyl methacrylate; a carboxylic acid group-containing monomer such as methacrylic acid, acrylic acid, itaconic acid, fumaric acid or maleic acid; an alkyl-substituted amino group-containing monomer such as<br>
dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate or diethylaminoethyl methacrylate; an amide group-containing monomer such as N,N-dimethylacrylamide, N,N-diethylacrylamide, N-methylacrylamide, methylenebisacrylamide, diacetone acrylamide, N-vinyl pyrrolidone or<br>
N-vinyl-N-methylacetamide; and an oxyalkylene group-containing monomer such as methoxy polyethylene glycol monomethacrylate or polypropylene glycol monoacrylate. [0033]<br>
An example of other usable monomers is a fluorine-containing monomer such as acrylic acid fluoroalkyl ester or methacrylic acid fluoroalkyl ester, including, e.g., trifluoroethyl acrylate, tetrafluoroethyl acrylate, tetrafluoropropyl acrylate, pentafluoropropyl acrylate, hexafluorobutyl acrylate, hexafluoroisopropyl acrylate and methacrylates corresponding to these acrylates, which may be selected depending on needed compatibility, hydrophilic property, water content and resistance to deposition. [0034]<br>
Furthermore, monomers containing siloxane such as tris(trimethylsiloxy)silylpropyl methacrylate,<br>
α-butyl--{3- [2- (2-methacryloxyethylcarbamoyloxy)ethoxy]propyl}po lydimethylsiloxane, a siloxane-containing macromonomer described in Examples A-l, B-l, C-l and D-l in Japanese Patent Publication No. Hll-502949, a siloxane-containing monomer (V2D25) described in U. S. Pat. No. 5260000, a siloxane-containing macromonomer described in Example 1 in Japanese Patent Publication No. 2003-528183, a siloxane-containing macromonomer (Al, A2) in International Publication WO2004/063795, and a siloxane-containing macromonomer described in Example 1 in Japanese Patent Publication No. 2001-311917 may be selected to improve oxygen permeability. [0035]<br>
An alkyl acrylate ester monomer, an alkyl methacrylate ester monomer, or the like may be also used as needed, examples of which include methyl acrylate, ethyl acrylate, n-propyl acrylate, n-butyl acrylate, cyclopentyl acrylate, n-stearyl acrylate, and methacrylates corresponding to these acrylates.<br>
