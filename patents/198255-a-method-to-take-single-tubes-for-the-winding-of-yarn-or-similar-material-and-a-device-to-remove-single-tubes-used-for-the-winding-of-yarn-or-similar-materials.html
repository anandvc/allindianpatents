				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The invention relates to a method to take single tubes for the winding of textile yarns or similar material  out of a container through an outlet opening of said container by means of a removing device, which moves through the outlet opening and takes on single tubes, and relates further to a device to apply the method.<br>
In spinning or twisting mills tubes are used onto which or from which thread, yarn or similar material is wound. In connection with these operations said tubes have to be collected, then singled out and conveyed to a new processing station.<br>
The collection of said tubes normally takes place in a container, whereby these tubes then have to be taken out from the container. For this purpose mostly a drum type removing device is used, which is arranged in the outlet opening and which on its circumference is provided with the corresponding grooves to receive tubes. By way of this process the tubes are singled out at the same time. A corresponding device is shown in the DE-OS 44 29 145.0. However, a great number of other removing devices are known. As just one example a chain is being mentioned.<br>
Practice has shown that the removing device is relatively often blocked, if for instance one tube has only partially entered a groove and thus is obstructing the turning movement of the removing device at the edge of the outlet opening. To release said obstructions nowadays the removing devices are turned backwards manually by approximately 10Â°, so that a tube can fall into the groove and thus the reason for the obstruction can be eliminated. Such a method is expensive and requires an additional operator.<br><br>
It is the object of the present invention to eliminate these disadvantages and to automate the elimination of the obstruction.<br>
The task is solved in that the movement of the removing device is monitored and when an obstruction of the removinq device in the outlet opening occurs, the removing device is turned in the opposite direction.<br>
Monitoring of the movement of the removing device can for instance be done optically. If the movement of the removinq device stalls, an obstruction has occurred. It is also possible to monitor the power consumption of the drive of the removing device. If said power consumption increases considerably then this is an indication for an obstruction. Other means for monitoring are possible and lay within the scope of the present invention.<br>
In the preferred embodiment monitoring indicates whether the removing device has reached a certain position. If a corresponding sensor, which is arranged to the removing device, indicates that the removing device has not reached a certain position during its movement, then this is an indication for the corresponding control unit that an obstruction has occurred.<br>
If an obstruction is indicated the momentary forward movement of the removing device is reversed into a backward movement, so that the obstruction is released. Thereafter the moving direction is switched to forward movement and the attempt to remove tubes can be started anew.<br>
Controlling of the removing device preferably takes place in dependence of predetermined time limits. At the start of the removing device for instance a time limit (time out) is set within which the removinq device has to reach a certain<br><br>
position. This is registered by the sensor. If the removing device does not reach the sensor within the predetermined time limit, the drive for the removing device is switched to reverse movement. The reverse movement of the removing device occurs preferably also within a predetermined time limit.<br>
Additionally the drive for the removing device should be laid out in such a way that on one hand it can rotate the removing device, that however, on the other hand the tubes are not being squashed during an obstruction of the tubes.<br>
If the obstruction is not eliminated during the first backward run, new attempts are made, that means the movement of the removing device is reversed several times. Thereafter an alarm signal shows up, which tells the operator that a rather serious obstruction has occurred at a certain transfer position for the tube, which has to be released manually. Practice has shown, however, that in most cases a one time reversal of the removing device is sufficient to release a minor obstruction.<br>
Crosswise arranged tubes, however, normally have to be inserted correctly by hand.<br>
A corresponding device to remove single tubes for winding of a yarn or similar material, out of a container through an outlet opening of said container by means of a removing device, which moves through the outlet opening and takes on single tubes is designed in such a way that a sensor is arranged to the removing device, said sensor indicating the movement i.e. the position of the removing device. Said sensor is connected with a corresponding drive by means of a control unit or circuit. For instance a corresponding circuit can comprise a counter for impulses of the sensor, whereby a comparator is arranged to said counter set at a<br><br>
desired value and whereby the comparator through a switch is being connected with a drive for the removing device.<br>
Additionally, a timer is to be arranged to the switch and the comparator, by means of which the movement of the removing device, in one or the other direction, is being controlled. Accordingly, a corresponding drive should be reversible for forward and backward movement.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a method to take single tubes, for the winding of yarn or similar material, out of a container through an outlet opening of said container by means of a removing device, which moves through the outlet opening and takes on single tubes characterized in that the movement of the removing device is monitored and in case that the removing device is blocked, the removing device in the outlet opening is turned in the opposite direction.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention also provides a device to remove single tubes, used for the winding of yam or similar materials, from a container through an outlet opening of said container by means of a removing device which moves through the outlet opening and which takes on single tubes characterized in that a sensor is arranged to the removing device to determine the movement, the position respectively of the removing device. Further advantages, characteristics and details of the invention are disclosed in the following description of preferred exemplified embodiments and according to the drawings in which:<br><br>
Figure 1	a schematic view of a device according to the invention for<br>
removing single tubes out of a container and for putting these tubes onto peg trays, and<br>
Figure 2	a drive and a control unit for the device according to figure 1,<br>
in a schematic block diagram presentation.<br>
According to figure 1 tubes 1 are arranged more or less horizontally in a funnel shaped container 2 above an outlet opening 3. Within said outlet opening 3 a removing device 4 is arranged, which turns around an axis 5. In the present embodiments said removing device 4 has the shape of a cylinder or drum and in its circumference grooves 6 are arranged parallel to the axis. Said grooves 6 serve to receive and take out the tubes 1 from the container 2 . Within the scope of the invention, however, the design of the removing device could be carried out in various ways. It could for example be arranged with a chain or similar means.<br><br>
The removing device 4 conveys tubes 1 within the grooves 6 by means of a turning movement along arrow 7 to a transfer device 8, indicated only schematically, for instance to a loading channel, wherein the tubes 1 are brought into an upright position and are being mounted onto peg trays 9. Said peg trays 9 are moved on a conveyor belt 10.<br>
A sensor 11 which monitors the movement of the removing device 4 is arranged to said removing device 4. The sensor 11 registers the presence of opposite elements 12, of which only one is shown in the present embodiment and which is located between two grooves 6. In the present embodiment five such grooves 6 are provided, whereby for the delivery of a tube 1 the removing device 4 has to be turned by one position at a time. Said position is registered by the sensor 11.<br>
Figure 2 shows the removing device 4 with one opposite element 12 being indicated, which is monitored by the sensor 11. The removing device 4 is connected to a drive 13. The drive 13 is mainly controlled by means of signals from the sensor 11. For this the sensor 11 is connected to a counter 14 which counts the elements 12 being registered by the sensor 11. To said counter 14 a comparator 15 is arranged in which the counted impulses from the counter 14 are compared with a set desired value 16, which is stored therein or being entered separately. Furthermore a timer 17 is arranged to the comparator. The timer 17 and the comparator 15 are connected with the drive 13 through a suitable switch 18.<br>
The function of the present invention is as follows:<br>
The drive 13 for the removing device 4 shown in figure 2 is initiated by means of the switch 18. Also at the same time a time-out in the timer 17 of for instance 2,0 sec. is<br><br>
started. The removing device 4 turns in the direction of arrow 7, whereby tubes 1 fall into the grooves 6, which move through the zone of the outlet opening 3.<br>
If the removing device 4 does not reach the next position within the time of the time-out, that means, that the sensor 11 does not register the next following element 12 and thus does not transmit any impulse to the counter 14, which could be compared with a set desired value 16 in the comparator 15, then, independently of the occurrence, whether or not a tube 1 has already fallen into a groove 6, the turning direction of the removing device 4 is reversed, in order to relieve or release the possible obstruction of a tube. The switch 18 and the drive 13 are arranged for a corresponding reversing function.<br>
The removing device is turned backwards for approximately 0,7 sec. After a waiting period of, for instance, also 0,7 sec, a new attempt is started and the removing device 4 is turned again in direction of the arrow 7. Thereby again a time-out of 2,0 sec. is set, up to which the removing device is required to reach the desired position. The sequential timing is controlled by the timer 17.<br>
If the position is not reached after a second attempt, the removing device 4 is turned backwards again for 0,7 sec. and then an alarm signal shows up. The specified time intervals are of course variable. They depend on the number of positions, grooves respectively, per rotation and on the desired mounting speed of the tubes, which in turn influences the rotational speed of the removing device.<br>
Practice has shown that usually a one-time reverse movement of the removing device 4 is sufficient to release a slight obstruction. In case of a complex obstruction, for instance if a tube 1 lies crosswise to the grooves, then even<br><br>
several repetitions of backward movements do not help. In that case the operator has to be involved. For this reason it is sufficient to program only one single release attempt in the control unit.<br><br><br>
