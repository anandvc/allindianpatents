				<td> PROCESS FOR MAKING RARE EARTH METAL OXIDE-COATED MICROPOROUS MATERIALS<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates generally to a process for making a catalytic metal oxide-coated microporous particulate material and related products.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Porous particulate materials carrying catalytically active elements are known in the art. These materials are useful in many processes, such as treating petroleum cuts or treating effluents, e.g., catalytically converting the exhaust gases emanating from internal combustion engines.<br>
The catalysts typically comprise a carrier produced by shaping a porous material such as alumina. Thus, the carrier may assume various shapes, such as spheres, cylindrical extrusions or extrusions having a polylobal cross-section or a cross-section of various shapes, such as a wheel.<br>
The porous materials generally used are alumina, silica, zeolites or the like. These carriers generally have a large specific surface area, e.g., over 20m2/g, to provide a large surface area which is rendered catalytically active by depositing catalytically active elements thereon.<br>
Various elements are, typically, impregnated into the porous material. For instance, U.S. Patent 5,232,889 is directed to a catalyst prepared by impregnating a porous material, preferably alumina spheres, with a colloidal dispersion of a metal to be deposited. The colloidal dispersion must have a particulate size no greater than the pore size of the porous material. When the colloidal dispersion penetrates the pores of the carrier, the reactive surface locations of the carrier change the pH of the dispersion, causing the metal to be deposited within the porous material. U.S. Patent 6,040,265 is also directed to impregnating a porous material, such as alumina or zeolites, with a solution of<br><br>
a primary metal acetate, at least one secondary metal acetate and an organic depositing reagent such as a soluble sugar, saccharides, polysaccharides, or ' derivations thereof, thereby forming an impregnated porous material. In addition, Canadian Patent 2,033,291 is directed to a catalyst for the conversion of nitrogen oxides in a high-temperature exhaust gas. The catalyst consists of a zeolite (the molar ratio of SiO2/Al2O3 is &gt; 20) that contains 0.5-10 wt% cerium oxide. The catalyst can be prepared either by impregnating the zeolite with an aqueous solution of a nitrate, a halide or a sulfate of cerium, or it can be prepared by effecting ion exchange. The mixture is then dried and calcined at 300-60O°C.<br>
The prior art also shows that other elements may form an aggregation with porous material to produce a catalytic material. For instance, U.S. Patent 5,804,526 is directed to an adsorbent that exhibits an excellent adsorption ability for nitrogen oxides. The adsorbent can be made up, for example, of an aggregate of cerium oxide and zeolite. The content of cerium oxide in the catalyst is in the range of 10% to 80% by weight based on the total equivalent zeolite and cerium oxide content. The adsorbent is made from a mixture of cerium oxide crystallite particles and zeolite particles of dealuminized ZSM-5 zeolite, wherein the cerium oxide crystallite particles are comprised of polycrystalline aggregates having an average crystalline grain size of less than 5 00A. As an aggregate, the cerium oxide crystallite particles are adjacent to surfaces of the zeolite particles.<br>
There are several patents that disclose the use of a catalytic coating on a porous metallic, or similar, support for the abatement of gases. U.S. Patent 4,900,712 relates to the adsorption of one or more catalytically active oxides onto high surface area alumina. The method of preparing the catalytic coating involves the use of a colloidal deposit approach to uniformly dope oxides on high surface area alumina.  The colloidal dispersions are prepared by taking an aqueous solution of a metal nitrate salt and converting the metal nitrate salt to a metal oxide colloid with an ion-exchange resin. The colloidal dispersion of the oxide is slurried with alumina, wherein the colloidal oxide particles are<br><br>
adsorbed onto the alumina. In order to maintain the adherence of the catalytic coating on the support and to ensure maintenance of a high surface area on the catalyst the doping oxide was limited to less than about 20% by weight, based' on the total equivalent alumina and doping oxide content.<br>
U.S. Patents 5,431,887 and 5,556,819 are directed to flame-arresting coated filters for use in catalytic broiler smoke abatement assemblies. The filter is coated with a slurry of alumina (zeolite may be used or a mixture of the two) and colloidally dispersed ceria; the ceria acting as a binder. The colloidal dispersion of ceria was made using high temperatures for extended periods of time, as described in the aforementioned U.S. Patent 4,900,712.<br>
There is, however, a need for a process that provides a stable free-flowing bulk catalytic metal oxide-coated microporous particulate material with a variety of loadings and obviates the shortcomings of the prior art.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Accordingly, the present invention relates to a novel process that provides a free-flowing bulk catalytic rare earth metal oxide-coated compatible microporous particulate material. Preferably, the compatible microporous material is a compatible aluminosilicate, such as a compatible zeolite particulate material.<br>
In the present invention, rare earth metals are defined as scandium, yttrium and the lanthanide metals.<br>
In one embodiment of the present invention, the process for making the catalytic rare earth metal oxide-coated microporous particulate material comprises the steps of:<br>
i)       combining an amount of colloidal dispersion of rare earth metal oxide hydrate with a compatible microporous particulate material to form a slurry, such that the amount of the colloidal dispersion is sufficient to provide, when heat treated as per step (ii), a particular percent by weight of the rare earth metal oxide and<br>
ii)      heat treating the slurry to fix the resultant rare earth metal oxide on the outer surfaces of the microporous particulate material, and a free flowing bulk particulate results.<br>
A compatible microporous material is defined as one that maintains compatibility with the colloidal dispersion so that the colloidal dispersion remains intact (i.e. that the particulate material remains in a substantially dispersed form). If the colloidal dispersion flocculates to a substantial degree before drying, then the slurry will not result in the formation of a free flowing powder upon the slurry being dried (such as in a spray drier) and the product may not be homogeneous. Accordingly, the microporous material is selected such as not to cause any substantial flocculation, of the colloidal particles in the dispersion, and preferably no or essentially no flocculation, of the colloidal particles in the dispersion. Some factors that determine the compatibility of the microporous material and the colloidal dispersion, include, but are not limited to: the pH of the microporous material and the presence of ionizable salts such<br><br>
as ammonium nitrate. If the pH is too high, then the colloids will flocculate. In such a case, by lowering the pH, the colloids may be dispersed in the fluid..<br>
Preferably, the compatible microporous particulate material is a compatible aluminosilicate and more preferably, a compatible zeolite particulate material. The compatible zeolite particulate material that may be used in the present invention includes, but is not limited to, silicalite zeolites, X, Y and L zeolites, faujasites ((Na2, Ca, Mg)29[Al58Sii34O384] • 240 H2O; cubic), P-zeolites (NaJAlnSi^aOns] with n
The zeolite materials used may also be characterized by the following formula:<br>
Mm M'aM'MaAlQa • b SiO2 • cTO2] wherein<br>
M is a monovalent cation,<br>
M' is a divalent cation,<br>
M" is a trivalent cation,<br>
a, b, c, n, m, and p are numbers which reflect the stoichiometric proportions,<br>
c, m, n or p can also be zero,<br>
Al and Si are tetrahedrally coordinated Al and Si atoms, and<br>
T is a tetrahedrally coordinated metal atom being able to replace Al or Si,<br><br>
the ratio of b/a of the zeolite, or the zeolite-like material, has a value of about 5 to about 300 and the micropore size of the zeolite is within the range of 5 to 13 A.<br>
Preferably, the rare earth metal oxide used is an oxide of a lanthanidc metal, yttrium, scandium or a mixture thereof. More preferably, the rare earth metal oxide is an oxide of cerium.<br>
The rare earth metal colloidal dispersions useful for the present invention are made from, but are not limited to, the following rare earth metal salts: YC13, Y2(CO3)3, Y(C2H3O2)3, Y(NO3)3, CeCl3, Ce2(CO3)3, Ce(C2H3O2)3, Ce(ClC&gt;4)3, and Ce(NO3)3. Preferably, the rare earth metal colloidal dispersion is prepared to a predetermined particle size ranging from 20 to lSOJDIn general, the colloidal dispersion is made by mixing an aqueous slurry of the rare earth metal salt with an acid to yield a hydrolyzable salt The preferred acids are nitric acid or hydrochloric acid. Alternatively, if the initial metal salt is a nitrate or a chloride, this step of mixing the nitrate or chloride salt with acid is unnecessary. By either approach, the resulting hydrolyzable salt, such as metal nitrate or metal chloride, is hydrolyzed. Preferably, it is hydrolyzed and oxidized by adding a mixture of ammonium hydroxide and hydrogen peroxide. A metal hydroxide is obtained and admixed, with water and a strong acid to yield a slurry. The strong acid may be, for example, nitric acid, hydrochloric acid or perchloric acid, and is capable of deaggregating the resulting insoluble metal hydrate. A residue from the slurry is then admixed with water to give the metal oxide colloidal dispersion. When nitric acid is used as the strong acid, the mole ratio of nitrate ions to rare earth metal oxide in said colloidal dispersion is in the range of 0.1 to 1.0; preferably, 0.1 to 0.5, and most preferably, 0.12 to 0.25.<br>
In embodiments, the colloidal dispersion may be prepared to a predetermined particle size range of 20 to 1500. The particle size is controlled by the precipitation and oxidation parameters used for formation of the colloidal dispersion. In particular embodiments, a base and, optionally,<br><br>
hydrogen peroxide are added to oxidize a hydrolyzable rare earth metal salt solution to yield a rare earth metal hydrate dispersion, and depending on:<br>
(i)      whether the reaction is done under hot or cold conditions,<br>
(ii)     whether the reaction is purged with air,<br>
(iii)    how concentrated the solution containing the rare earth metal hydrate is,<br>
(iv)    whether the base is added to the salt or vice-versa; the crystallite size may be varied from 20 to 100Q. In other particular embodiments, to make<br>
larger particles such as 100 to 1500, the base is added to a hydrolyzable rare earth metal salt solution and allowed to slowly oxidize in air.<br>
In one embodiment, the colloidal dispersion is prepared to a predetermined particle size range of 20 to 50D. Ammonium hydroxide and hydrogen peroxide are mixed with a cerium nitrate solution, forming a cerium hydroxide solution. Nitric acid is then added to the cerium (IV) hydroxide solution and a colloidal dispersion of 20 to SOD cerium oxide hydrate particles and nitrate ions result. Preferably, the mole ratio of nitrate ions to cerium oxide in said colloidal dispersion is in the range of 0.12 to 0.25. Other embodiments are feasible, wherein any suitable hydrolysable rare earth metal salt or mixtures thereof may be substituted, any suitable strong acids capable of deaggregating the resulting insoluble rare earth metal hydrate such as hydrochloric acid or perchloric acid, may be substituted, and any suitable base such as sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, tetraethyl ammonium hydroxide may be substituted. Preferably, the base has a pH greater than 4. More preferably, the base is selected from the group, consisting of ammonium hydroxide and derivatives thereof. When sodium or potassium hydroxide is used as the base, the sodium and potassium are difficult to remove from the precipitated hydrate particles. Several washings of the particles are therefore required.<br><br>
In another embodiment, ammonium hydroxide is mixed with a cerium nitrate solution, wherein the mixture is purged with air, e.g. air is bubbled into the mixture. A cerium (IV) hydroxide solution results and nitric acid is then added and a colloidal dispersion of 50 to 700 cerium oxide hydrate particles and nitrate ions are formed. Preferably, the mole ratio of nitrate ions to cerium oxide in said colloidal dispersion is in the range of 0.12 to 0.25. Other embodiments are feasible, wherein any suitable hydrolysable rare earth metal salt or mixtures thereof, any suitable strong acids and any suitable base, as mentioned above, may be substituted.<br>
In another embodiment, ammonium hydroxide is mixed with a cerium nitrate solution, wherein the mixture is slowly oxidized in air, for example, allowed to sit at room temperature for a few days, to yield a cerium (IV) hydroxide solution. Nitric acid is men added to the solution and a colloidal dispersion of 100 to 150D cerium oxide hydrate particles and nitrate ions result. Preferably, the mole ratio of nitrate ions to cerium oxide in said colloidal dispersion is in the range of 0.12 to 0.25. Other embodiments are feasible, wherein any suitable hydrolysable rare earth metal salt or mixtures thereof, any suitable strong acids and any suitable base, as mentioned above, may be substituted.<br>
Cerous and/oT eerie salts can be converted into cerium (TV) colloids relatively easily. In another embodiment, the dispersion is made by admixing an'aqueous slurry of cerium carbonate with nitric acid. The resulting cerium nitrate is hydrolyzed and oxidized through the addition of a mixture of ammonium hydroxide and hydrogen peroxide. Cerium hydroxide is obtained and admixed with water and nitric acid to yield the cerium colloidal dispersion, which comprises cerium oxide hydrate particles and nitrate ions. The cerium colloidal dispersion is then added to a compatible zeolite to form a slurry, which is heat treated at a temperature as described above to give the free- • flowing particulate.<br><br>
In general, the sluiry of the colloidal dispersion of rare earth metal oxide hydrate and compatible microporous particulate material is quite stable. It has been found that the slurry is stable to coagulation and chemical changes, such as chemical reactions, dissolution, pH changes and conductance changes.<br>
The microporous particulate material has an average pore size that is less than the average particle size of the colloidal dispersion so that the colloidal dispersion can be positioned on the outer surfaces of the material. Preferably, the material has an average pore size that is less than about 20A and the colloidal dispersion has a particle size of at least about 20A. More preferably, the material has an average pore size mat is less than about lOA.<br>
Preferably, there is greater than 20% by weight of the rare earth metal oxide (based on the total equivalent microporous particulate material and rare earth metal oxide content) coated on the outer surfaces of the microporous particulate material. High loadings of the rare earth metal oxide coated on the outer surface is provided, preferably, in the range of from about 20 to about 70% by weight based on the total equivalent rare earth metal oxide and microporous particulate material content The free flowing particulate, that is the microporous particulate material having high loadings of rare earth metal oxide, is, surprisingly, quite stable.<br>
The stability of the free flowing particulate is measured by the teachability of the rare earth metal oxide-coated microporous particulate material; low leachability is equated to a stable particulate material. The leachability is determined by the amount of rare earth metal oxide that dissolves (leaches) into water when the rare earth metal oxide-coated microporous particulate material is slurried in water.<br>
The rare earth metal oxide-coated microporous particulate material may be heat treated at a variety of temperatures and combinations of temperatures while still maintaining its stability. In particular embodiments, when a rare earth metal oxide-coated microporous particulate material is heat treated at temperatures less man about 200°C and slurried in water, surprisingly, very little rare earth metal oxide is leachable. Since the material was heat treated at<br><br>
such low temperatures, it was expected that the rare earth metal oxide would completely leach into the water. It was found, however, that, typically, less than 30% by weight of the rare earth metal oxide (based on the total equivalent rare earth metal oxide content) leached into water, which shows that the particulate material is quite stable even when heat treated at temperatures less than about 200°C. When the rare earth metal oxide-coated microporous particulate material is heat treated at temperatures greater than about 400°C and slurried in water, usually less than 0.1% by weight of the rare earth metal oxide (based on the total equivalent rare earth metal oxide content) is found to leach into water. These results are true for both high and low loadings. Unlike the approach of the prior art, the present approach works well to provide a variety of loadings including high loadings (greater than about 20% by weight of the rare earth metal oxide) using a variety of temperatures up to about 900 °C, including sequential temperatures, without destroying the high surface area or catalytic activity of the material.<br>
In preferred embodiments, the resulting slurry of the process of the present invention may be heat treated at temperatures below about 200°C, above about 400°C or sequential combinations thereof wherein the slurry is heat treated, firstly, at temperatures below about 200°C and secondly, above about 400°C. Preferably, the slurry is heat treated at a temperature below about 200°C and then subsequently at a temperature above about 400°C. More preferably, the slurry is heat treated at a temperature of from about 85°C to about 105°C and then subsequently at a temperature above about 400°C, wherein the slurry is heated at a rate of 100°C/hour until it reaches a temperature above about 400°C. At this point, the temperature is held for at least 1 hour.  Deleterious results occur to the rare earth metal oxide-coated microporous particulate material if it is heat treated only at a temperature between about 200°C and about 400°C for a commercially feasible period of time, normally, 5 hours. Although it is possible to heat the rare earth metal oxide-coated microporous particulate material at a temperature between about 200°C and about 400°C for several weeks such that no deleterious results occur,<br><br>
this would not be practical for the manufacture of the rare earth metal oxide-coated microporous participate material.<br>
Without being bound to any particular theory, it is thought that when the colloidal dispersion of rare earth metal oxide hydrate is combined with a compatible microporous material to form a slurry, the counter ions of the strong acid used in making the colloidal dispersion (e.g. nitrate ions) migrate into the pores of the microporous material and the rare earth metal oxide is fixed to the outer surfaces of the microporous material such that the rare earth metal oxide is no longer water dispersible. It is thought that when the drying step is done at lower temperatures, i.e. below about 200°C, it enhances fixing of the rare earth metal oxide to the outer surfaces of the microporous material and the rare earth metal oxide-coated microporous particulate material is insoluble in water. If, however, the drying step occurs between about 200 °C and about 400°C for a commercially feasible period of time, normally 5 hours, the counter ions are thought to be released from the pores of the microporous material and are available to recombine with the rare earth metal oxide component to reform water dispersible rare earth metal oxide. Overall, this would destroy the rare earth metal oxide-coated microporous particulate material if it were dissolved in water. In other words, the rare earth metal oxide would leach into the water destroying the rare earth metal oxide-coated microporous particulate matter. When heating is continued to above about 400°C, it is thought that the counter ions decompose to gaseous components, which are released from the pores of the rare earth metal oxide-coated microporous particulate material so mat the material remains insoluble in water.<br>
Accordingly, in one embodiment, the slurry is heat treated to fix the rare earth metal oxide to the outer surfaces of the microporous material. The fixing heat treatment step may comprise a drying step and/or a calcining step.<br>
In the drying step, the slurry is preferably heated at a temperature and for a period of time sufficient to form a dry powder (i.e. to drive off at least some, and more preferably all or essentially all, of the water from the slurry). Preferably, the solution is dried (such as by a spray drier) at a temperature<br><br>
below about 200°C. In most cases, the drying step includes either spray drying, tray drying, freeze drying, solvent drying or flash drying techniques or combinations thereof.<br>
In the calcining step, the slurry or a dried powder is preferably heated at a temperature and for a period of time sufficient to remove or decompose at least some of the counter ions, and more preferably all or essentially all of the counter ions., from the resultant dried microporous material. During this process, remaining water (if the slurry was not already subjected to an initial low temperature drying process) is driven off and at least some of the counter ions are decomposed, and more preferably all or essentially all of the counter ions are decomposed, to gaseous components. Preferably, the solution is spray dried and calcined in a single process step, such as in a spray calciner. However, this may heat treatment may be performed in two steps, such as initial drying step (e.g. by means of a spray drier) followed by the calcining step.<br>
In another embodiment, the preferred rare earth metal used in the aforementioned process is cerium and the preferred compatible microporous material is a compatible zeolite particulate material. There may be greater than about 1% by weight, based on the total equivalent zeolite and cerium oxide content, of the cerium oxide coated on the outer surfaces of the zeolite particulate material. High loadings of the cerium oxide coated on the outer surface is provided, typically, in the range of from about 20 to about 70% by weight based on the total equivalent cerium oxide and zeolite content. The zeolite particulate material, having high loadings of cerium oxide, are, surprisingly, quite stable. When the cerium oxide-coated zeolite particulate material is heat treated at temperatures less than about 200°C and slurried in water, surprisingly, very little cerium oxide is leachable. Typically, less than 30% by weight of the cerium oxide (based on the total equivalent cerium oxide content) is found to leach into water, which shows that the particulate material is quite stable even when heat treated at temperatures less than about 200°C.<br><br>
When the cerium oxide-coated zeolite participate material is heat treated at temperatures greater than about 400°C and sluiried in water, usually less than 0.1% by weight of the cerium oxide (based on the total equivalent cerium oxide content) is found to leach into water.<br>
The slurry is preferably spray dried at a temperature below about 200°C. In most cases, the heat treating step includes either spray drying, tray drying, freeze drying, solvent drying or flash drying techniques or combinations thereof.<br>
The zeolite particulate material has an average pore size that is less than the average particle size of the colloidal dispersion of cerium oxide hydrate so that the colloidal dispersion can be positioned on the outer surfaces of the zeolite. Preferably, the zeolite has an average pore size that is less than 20A and the ceria colloidal dispersion has a particle size of at least 20A.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the aforementioned process incorporates an additional step (iii) of milling the bulk particulate to provide a particle size in the range of 1 to 25 microns.<br>
The catalytic rare earth metal oxide-coated microporous particulate materials can be used in a variety of different applications.  In one aspect of the invention, the metal oxide-coated microporous particulate materials can be incorporated into the cigarette paper enclosing a conventional tobacco rod to reduce side stream smoke emissions. Specifically, the particulate material can be used as a filler in the manufacture of cigarette paper, impregnated in a cigarette paper, or applied as a coating(s) or a layer(s) on the exterior and/or interior surface of a cigarette paper. Alternatively, the treated paper could be used as a multiple wrap; that is, the treated paper may be applied as an outer wrap over a cigarette having conventional cigarette paper.<br>
In another aspect of the invention, the particulate material can be used to catalyze exhaust gases from the combustion of a fuel, such as automobile exhaust fumes.  A modern automobile engine produces many pollutants caused by the incomplete combustion of hydrocarbon fuels. Exhaust gas mixtures typically contain CO, unburned hydrocarbons, and several thousand ppm NOx.<br><br>
Catalytic converters that reduce these three by products of combustion are referred to as three-way catalysts. Other uses include a coating on the inner walls of self-cleaning ovens, catalytic cracking, thermal sprayed coatings and abradable seals,<br>
A catalyst, such as cerium oxide, has the ability to provide oxygen for completing hydrocarbon and CO oxidation during periods when the engine is running rich. When the engine is running lean, cerium is oxidized to Ce4+ which stores oxygen. When the fuel-rich cycle begins, cerium is able to change oxidation states reversibly from Ce4+ to Ce3+, providing oxygen for chemical reactions (e.g. converting CO to CO2). For the catalyst to be able to work effectively under the high temperatures that exist in a tail pipe, it must have sufficient surface area to provide enough active sites for catalytic reactions. The ceria-coated microporous particulate materials made in accordance with the present invention provide a high catalytic surface area to effect sufficient catalysis of the pollutants. Additionally, the ceria is stabilized by the microporous particulate materials to enable the oxide to withstand the high temperatures in the tail pipe.<br>
The following Examples are being submitted to further illustrate various aspects of the present invention. These Examples are intended to be illustrative only and are not intended to limit the scope of the present invention.<br>

Example 1<br>
Cerium carbonate (50 g, 99.9% purity) containing 69.3% by weight cerium oxide equivalent was slurried with distilled water (0.1 L) and dissolved by adding nitric acid (38.4 ml; 16 M). The resulting neutral solution was boiled for a few minutes, filtered to remove traces of insoluble matter, and diluted to 1 L with water to give a cerous nitrate solution. A mixture comprising ammonium hydroxide (40 ml, 18 M), hydrogen peroxide (20 ml, "100 volume") and water (160 ml) was added with stirring to the cerous nitrate<br><br>

The precipitate was centrifuged and washed twice by stirring with successive 1 L volumes of distilled water. The separated precipitate was stirred with distilled water (750 ml) and nitric acid (12.5 ml of 16 M) to give a nitric acid/ cerium oxide mole ratio of 1. The resulting slurry was heated to about 70°C for 15 minutes to deaggregate the cerium (IV) hydroxide and give a conditioned slurry. The pH of the conditioned slurry was less than 1.<br>

The gel powders, as described in Table 2, are spherical and free-flowing. The gel powders were examined by thermogravimetric analysis to determine the preferred heat treatment temperature and then were subjected to heat treatment at 500°C (the gel powder is heated at a rate of 100°C /hour until it reaches a temperature of 500°C, where the temperature is held for at least 1 hour), where weight loss and/or NOX emissions was observed.

Since the density of ceria is much higher than the density of zeolite, the results of the experiment shown in Table 3 confirms that the ceria is with the ceria-zeolite gel powder, as the percent by weight ceria increases, the density increases.<br>
Non-Leach able Ceria-Zeolite Gel Powders Example 9<br>
10.0 g of a ceria-zeolite gel powder (Zeolyst™ CBV 720 obtained from Zeolyst International; pH 3 to 5), prepared as described in Example 8 (except not heat treated at 500°Q and containing 4.4 g of cerium oxide (44% by weight cerium oxide), was added to 100 ml of water and heated to 70°C for approximately 10 minutes. This solution was then centrifuged and to the resulting clear supernatant (leach liquor) was added ammonium hydroxide, which precipitated any ceria dissolved in the supernatant Only 0.35 g of ceria was found in the leach liquor.<br>
Example 10<br>
10.0 g of a ceria-zeolite gel powder (Zeolyst™ CBV 600 obtained from Zeolyst International; pH 3 to 5), similarly prepared as Example 5 (not heat treated at 500°C) and containing 6.5 g of cerium oxide (65% by weight cerium oxide), was added to 50 ml of water and heated to 70°C for approximately 10 minutes. The conductivity was measured and found to be 10 x 10'3 Siemens.<br>
Example 11<br>
10.0 g of a ceria-zeolite gel powder (Zeolyst™ CBV 600 obtained from Zeolyst International; pH 3 to 5), similarly prepared as Example 5 (not heat treated at 500°C) and containing 4.4 g of cerium oxide (44% by weight cerium oxide), was added to 50 ml of water and heated to 70°C for approximately 10 minutes. The conductivity was measured and found to be 6.4 x 10*3 Siemens.<br>
Increased conductivity equates to more leaching of ceria, thus, Examples 10 and 11 show that with increased loadings of ceria, the conductivity seems to<br><br>
increase proportionately, which means more leaching of ceria.  Although leaching increased with higher loadings, it has been found that, samples heat treated at temperatures less than about 200°C, typically, have less than 30% by weight of the cerium oxide (based on the total equivalent cerium oxide content) leach into water.<br>
These examples exhibit a wide range of weight percentages of cerium oxide-coated zeolites. Experiments show an increasing correlation between high resultant densities of the cerium oxide-coated zeolites and higher loadings of cerium oxide. Surprisingly, the stability of these coated zeolites, even without heat treating the cerium oxide-coated zeolites above 500°C, is quite high, as recognized in Examples 9 to 11.<br>
