				<td>The invention relates to an auxiliary indication or tripping unit housed in a case having a first side panel and an opposite second side panel, designed to be adjoined to a case of conjugate shape of a circuit breaker or of another auxiliary unit, and comprising:<br>
-	a rotary actuating element equipped with a drive lug passing through a first orifice arranged in the first side panel of the case and designed to operate in conjunction with a first female coupling part of the circuit breaker or a second female coupling part of another auxiliary unit, respectively via a second orifice arranged in the panel of the circuit breaker, or in said second side panel,<br>
-	a tripping pin protruding out from the first side panel,<br>
-	and means for enabling the cases to be adjoined when the states of the<br>
mechanisms are in agreement.<br>
Auxiliary units used in the prior art have visible protruding handles and their positions can easily be checked visually with respect to those of the circuit breaker. The problem is different for auxiliary units not having accessible handles. In this case, the mechanism actuating element is integrated in the case and has to be able to be coupled to the circuit breaker or to other auxiliary units. Association is performed blind with risks of incorrect assembly if the states of the mechanisms are in disagreement.<br><br>
The object of the invention is to achieve an auxiliary indication or tripping unit enabling reliable association in state agreement with a circuit breaker or another auxiliary unit.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides an auxiliary indication or tripping unit housed in a case having a first side panel and an opposite second side panel, designed to be adjoined to a case of conjugate shape of a circuit breaker, or of another auxiliary unit, and comprising: a rotary actuating element equipped with a drive lug passing through a first orifice arranged in the first side panel of the case and designed to operate in conjunction with a first female coupling part of the circuit breaker, or a second female coupling part of another auxiliary unit, respectively via a second orifice arranged in the panel of the circuit breaker, or in said second side panel, a tripping pin protruding out from the first side panel, and means for enabling the cases to be adjoined when the states of the mechanisms are in agreement, characterized in that the actuating element is provided with an access key, and that said second orifice is arranged as a lock allowing the key to enter in the open position of the actuating element only, engagement of the drive lug in the first or second female coupling part taking place when the mechanism of the circuit breaker or of the adjacent auxiliary unit is itself in the same open state.<br><br>
According to a preferred embodiment, the lock is formed by a groove made at the end of the second curved orifice. The key comprises a stop designed to come into engagement against the adjacent case to prevent the units from being adjoined when the corresponding mechanism is not in the open state.<br>
According to one feature of the invention, the first side panel of the case comprises at least two clipping parts formed by flexible latching tabs designed to clip into recesses of the adjacent case.<br>
It advantageously comprises error prevention means designed to prevent insertion of an auxiliary indication unit between an auxiliary tripping unit and the circuit breaker. The error prevention means comprise a first male centering part associated to a first male directing part on the first side panel, and a first female centering part associated to a first female directing part on the second side panel, the assembly being arranged to enable association of at least two auxiliary indication units.<br>
The error prevention means comprise a second male centering part associated to a second male directing part on the first side panel, and a second female centering part associated to a second female directing part, the assembly being arranged to enable an auxiliary indication unit to be adjoined to the second side panel and to prevent association on the opposite side on the first side panel of the auxiliary tripping unit.<br><br>
Other advantages and features of the invention will become more clearly apparent from the following description of an embodiment of the invention, given as a non-restrictive example only and represented in the accompanying drawings, in which:<br>

Figure 14 shows a is vertical sectional view of association of the auxiliary<br>
indication unit with a circuit breaker;<br>
Figures 15 and 16 are detailed enlarged scale views of figure 14.<br><br>
In figures 1 to 5, an auxiliary indication or tripping unit 10 is adjoined to the side panel 12 of a circuit breaker 14 with coupling of a mechanical tripping link and of a handle driving link. The auxiliary unit 10 is housed in a case 16 made of molded plastic material having an identical profile to that of the case 18 of the circuit breaker 14.<br>
The auxiliary unit 10 is not equipped with a visible handle and is composed of two inverter circuits, each comprising a movable contact operating in conjunction with two stationary contacts connected to a pair of connection terminals. The movable contact is actuated by means of an operating mechanism, of which only the actuating element in manual operation 20 is represented in figures 3 to 5.<br>
The actuating element 20 of the auxiliary unit 10 is formed by a rotary base 22<br>
integrated inside the case 16 and having a limited angular movement<br>
corresponding to the travel of the handle 24 of the circuit breaker 14 between<br>
the open position and the closed position. The base 22 is equipped with a drive<br>
lug 26 protruding out from the case 16 and disposed facing a curved orifice 28<br>
arranged in the side panel 12 of a circuit breaker 14. The end of the drive lug<br>
26 is shaped as a key 30 and the right- 	<br><br>
hand part of the orifice 28 presents a groove 32 of conjugate shape to the key 30 so as to form a lock (figure 2). The pivoting support 34 of the handle 24 of the circuit breaker 14 comprises a first female coupling part 36 moving along the orifice 28 inside the case 18. The male drive lug 26 of the actuating element 20 engages in the first female coupling 36 to form the drive link between the auxiliary unit 10 and the circuit breaker 14.<br>
The location of the groove 32 corresponds to the open position of the circuit breaker 14 and the key 30 can only enter the orifice 28 completely at the level of the groove 32.<br>
A first coupling condition consists in placing the actuating element 20 in the open position of the auxiliary unit 10 so as to position the key 30 facing the groove 32. If the auxiliary unit 10 is in another position, for example in the closed position, any attempt to associate it to the circuit breaker 14 is rendered impossible following the end 33 of the key 30 coming into engagement with the case of the circuit breaker 14.<br>
The second coupling condition consists in placing the first female coupling part 36 in alignment with the groove 32 of the orifice 28, which is only possible in the open position of the circuit breaker 14. The drive lug 26 can then enter the first coupling part 36 in the direction of the arrow F1 (figure 4) to form the drive link when the circuit breaker 14 and auxiliary unit 10 are adjoined via their respective panels. If the mechanism of the circuit breaker 14 is in the closed state or in the tripped state, the key 30 can enter the groove 32 of the lock, but comes up against the stop formed by the edge 38 of the support 34 of the handle 24 preventing any engagement in the first coupling part 36 (figure 5). This results in a lateral separation between the two cases<br><br>
18, 16 of the circuit breaker 14 and auxiliary unit 10 indicating to the fitter the handling error and the disagreement of states between the two modules.<br>
Association between two or more auxiliary indication or tripping units 10 is performed with similar coupling means to those used for the circuit breaker 14, and with additional error prevention means preventing certain combinations. Opposite from the drive lug 26, the rotary base 22 of the actuating element 20 of each auxiliary unit 10 comprises a second female coupling part 40 (figures 3 to 5) having a similar shape to that of the first coupling part 36 of the circuit breaker 14. The second coupling part 40 moves along a curved orifice 42 arranged in the left-hand side panel 44 of the case 10 {figure 1). The orifice 42 is equipped with a groove 32 of identical shape to that of the orifice 28 of the panel 12 of the circuit breaker 14, and disposed in alignment with it in the direction of adjoinment of the modules. To achieve association of two auxiliary units 10, the same coupling conditions are applicable for forming the drive link between the respective mechanisms of the two units. The two mechanisms must be simultaneously in the open state so as to enable the key 30 of one of the modules to be engaged in the groove 32 of the adjacent lock and in the second coupling part 40 of the other module.<br>
Figures 6 to 9 show association of two auxiliary units 10A for open/closed (OC) or fault signal (FS) indication, each case 16 having a width of 9 mm.<br>
The drive lug 26, a tripping pin 48, a pair of clipping parts 50, 52, a first male centering part 54, and a first male directing part 56 can be seen protruding out from the right-hand side panel 46 of each auxiliary unit 10A. The drive lug 26 passes through an orifice 58 of similar shape and aligned with that 42 of the other panel 44,<br>
but not provided with a lock. The tripping pin 48 engages in the trip lever of the<br><br>
adjacent module to constitute the mechanical tripping link- The clipping parts 50, 52 are formed by flexible latching tabs designed to clip into recesses of the adjacent case. The first male centering part 54 comprises a tubular rod located at the top part of the case 16, whereas the first male directing part 56 is equipped with a semi-cylindrical stud provided at the bottom part of the case 16 near to the fixing rail.<br>
The opposite left-hand side panel 44 of each auxiliary unit 10A is provided, in addition to the orifice 42, with a first female centering part 60 and a first female directing part 62. The first female centering part 60 enables the tubular rod of the first male centering part 54 to engage to obtain multidirectional blocking in the junction plane of the two cases. The first female directing part 62 is provided with a U-shaped notch at the bottom part of the panel 44 allowing a slight clearance of the male directing part 56 in the direction of the notch.<br>
Figures 10 to 13 represent association of an auxiliary indication unit 10A with an auxiliary tripping unit 10B, the latter having a width of 18 mm. The auxiliary indication unit 10A must be placed to the left of the auxiliary tripping unit 10B, the latter being able to be constituted by an undervoltage release, or a shunt release, designed to transmit a tripping order to the circuit breaker 14. The auxiliary indication unit 10A is identical to the one described with reference to figures 6 to 9 and comprises the first male and female centering parts 54, 60, and the first male and female directing parts 56, 62.<br>
The right-hand side panel 66 of the auxiliary tripping unit 10B comprises clipping parts 50, 52, a tripping pin 48, a drive lug 26 passing through an orifice 58, a second male centering part 68, and a second male directing part 70. The second male<br><br>
centering part 68 and the second male directing part 70 are formed by cylindrical studs protruding out from the side panel 66.<br>
The left-hand side panel 72 of the auxiliary tripping unit 10B is provided, in addition to the orifice 42, with a second female centering part 74 and a second female directing part 76. The second female centering part 74 is placed at the same place as the first female centering part 60 and can receive the first male centering part 54, if the auxiliary indication unit 10A is juxtaposed on the left of the auxiliary tripping unit 10B (case of figure 12).<br>
The reverse is impossible in case of an attempt to juxtapose the auxiliary indication unit 10A on the right, as the second male centering part 68 cannot engage in the first female centering part 60. The size of the second male directing part 70 also prevents it from engaging in the first female directing part 62.<br>
Figures 14 to 16 show association of an auxiliary indication unit 10A with the circuit breaker 14. The auxiliary indication unit 10A is identical to the one described previously and comprises the first male and female centering parts 54, 60 and the first male and female directing parts 56, 62. The side panel 12 of the circuit breaker 14 is equipped with a third female centering part 78 and with a third female directing part 80.<br>
The third female centering part 78 can receive the first male centering part 54, but also the second male centering part 68. The same is true of the third female directing part 80 in which the first male directing part 56 or the second male directing part 70 can engage. The combination of figure 10 can therefore be associated to the panel 12 of the circuit breaker.<br><br>
On the other hand, the auxiliary indication units 10A can never be fitted between an auxiliary tripping unit 10B and the circuit breaker 14.<br><br><br>
