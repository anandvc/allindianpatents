The invention relates to a vacuum pipe connector for a vacuum cleaner, with a vacuum pipe section as connector and a complementary part as connector socket of an  attachment appliance or  the like, and electrical contacts, in which the electrical contacts are arranged outside a cross section of the vacuum pipe section and the complementary part.<br>
It is known to make the connection region essentially shield or crest shaped as seen in cross sectional profile. In this construction the electrical contacts lie in the region of the flattening. These occupy an essentially rectangular surface area. The remaining cross section is available as a vacuum channel, but with two corner zones.<br>
An object of the invention is to improve the construction and functioning of the vacuum cleaner connection system.<br>
A constructionally advantageous, operationally favourable connection system is achieved as a result of such an embodiment. An optimal flow guidance with more secure coupling is provided, while maintaining the advantageous separation of the vacuum flowpath from the electrical supply path and the avoidance of a non-circular connector profile. The relevant regions are divided in a clear and spatially balanced manner. More particularly this is achieved in that the vacuum channel, which is not influenced by the electrical contacts, and which leads to and is received in the complementary part, has a cross section which is provided on the top side thereof with a flattened area, intended for the electrical contacts, and in that the electrical contacts in the region of this flattening are integrated into an external cross section which is substantially circular. This gives a closer approximation to a circular shape, without however being perfectly circular, which still takes into account the ergonomic proportions; nevertheless the arrangement of electrical contacts, having regard to a more circular positioning, allows these contacts to be made larger or  allows the number of contacts to be increased. The additional contacts may serve as signal contacts, while the power lines extend centrally. Even the flattened area has an  at least slightly curved shape as a result of the<br><br>
inwardly directed continuation of the curved row of electrical contacts. It is further proposed that the electrical contacts be provided in a mutually side by side arrangement. In this way the area of the segment of the circle, which is small, is best used. This applies also with reference to the following features in accordance with which the electrical contacts each comprise externally a round plug and a round socket. The generally wider tongue-type electrical contacts are then disposed in the mid-region. It is to be understood that the electrical contacts which are of male/female type may be provided on the connector or on the connector socket. To continue with the matters mentioned it is therefore advantageous that the electrical contacts comprise two flat pin plugs or pin sockets respectively and two round pin plugs or two round plug sockets respectively. In order to ensure that a coupling alignment of the vacuum pipe section and complementary part is provided, the connector sockets are located recessed relative to a mouth section of the vacuum pipe section. Of prime importance is that the profile of the connector and connector socket matingly engage. The socket contacts are thus kept free of forces arising from the connection. Right from the beginning of coupling an assured choice of the functional region is provided, because the connector sockets are arranged so as to be free standing relative to an outer wall of the vacuum pipe section. So that, after detachment of an attachment appliance, the free end of the vacuum pipe section including connector may be used as a flat nozzle, it is proposed that a plane of the mouth cross section and a longitudinal axis of the latter be at an acute angle to one another. In other words, the vacuum mouth of the vacuum pipe section is cut at an angle. The appropriate angle may be about 30°. As a result corner regions of the floor may be cleaned by vacuuming. It is further proposed, that the vacuum pipe section to be inserted into a socket of the complementary part, has an external cross section which increases step wise, starting from a mouth cross section. That gives an advantageous easily overcome pre-centring of the components to be coupled, in which the angular fine alignment of the connector and connector socket by frictional engagement takes place only after passing the step. The operator is conscious of a satisfactory, well sealed guidance right into the end position. It is of course to be understood that no false socket opportunity is provided in the construction of a step in the<br><br>
region of greater cross sectiona] area. The connector  socket advantageously covers a part only of the larger step. The change in thickness which provides the step is further made use of in that a groove is provided on the step riser for receiving a sealing ring. The sealing ring also functions from the beginning of the load bearing coupling engagement. One edge of the groove effectively coincides with the step, so that this side has a greater depth. An embodiment of this type is intended primarily for receiving a sealing ring having a V-profile. In order that the vacuum mouth of the connector be protected from wear when being used as a vacuum nozzle, the diametrically smallest part of the vacuum pipe section comprises an external, interchangeable sleeve. It functions as an edge protection ring cap and is best fixed to the outer surface of the vacuum pipe section. In accordance with the invention projecting stops are provided on  the diametrically smallest part, which engage in mating recesses in the sleeve. Because the relatively large outer surface provides space for many projecting stops, it is also possible to use relatively low projecting stops. By appropriate choice of the axial length of the sleeve, the end thereof may be shaped in the form of a projecting sealing collar, so that a separate sealing ring may be avoided. In order to further improve the correct positioning of the wear protector, in the form of the sleeve, the vacuum pipe section comprises a circumferential rib on its front face in the region of the mouth section. Correspondingly, the sleeve includes a corresponding mating groove for co-operation with the rib, which is a tight fit in the groove. The engaged surfaces provided by the rib subtend an angle of 30 . With regard to the complementary part, that is to say the connector socket, this comprises a step shaped taper for mating with the vacuum pipe cross section. Where a sleeve is provided the taper is increased, that is to say this part is further reduced on the outer wall side. It is further proposed that the vacuum pipe cross section (connector) comprises electric plug sockets and that the complementary part (connector socket) includes electric plug pins. A further feature for achieving the maximum possible mechanical protection of the electrical contact components comprises a so called connector guide. This connector guide is achieved by increasing the surface area of the load bearing shoulders of the coupling components in the region of the coupling between vacuum pipe section and complementary part. The<br><br>
increase in surface area may be simply achieved in that the shoulders etc. do not extend perpendicularly to the lengthwise centre axis of the connector and connector socket, but are displaced relative to this line. In the embodiment the increase in surface area for the connector guide is achieved by means of an incline or an undulation.<br>
In order to  ensure compatibility with existing appliances the coupling regions of which have crest or shield shaped cross sectional profiles, the invention also proposes a plug adapter. A plug adapter of this type with a vacuum pipe section and electrical contacts which are disposed outside a cross section of the vacuum pipe section is characterised in that the adapter is constructed on both sides as a connector. It is further proposed that the adapter is constructed on both sides as a connector socket. The structural features are such that, in the case of a construction comprising a connector on both sides, the connector on one side corresponds to one or more of the connector characteristics of claims 1 to 18. Conversely, in the case of a construction comprising a connector socket on both sides, the connector socket on  one side corresponds to one or more of the connector socket characteristics of claims 1 to 18.<br>

The vacuum cleaner 1 illustrated, by way of example, as a hand operated vacuum cleaner includes an electric motor in a housing 2 provided on the side thereof nearest the floor, which drives a vacuum fan. The floor to be cared for is indicated by reference numeral 3.<br>
A vacuum pipe connector 4 extends from the housing 2, ending in a<br><br>
vacuum pipe section 5 which may be formed integrally therewith.<br>
The vacuum pipe section 5 constitutes a connector E.<br>
The complementary part 6 therefor constitutes a connector socket A. The connection may be seen in Figures 6 and 7,<br>
The complementary part 6 may mounted on an attachment appliance V. In the present exemplary embodiment this attachment appliance V is a vacuum nozzle. The latter includes a brush wheel 7 driven by an electric motor, the former being arranged in the vacuum channel of the vacuum nozzle.<br>
The power supply for the electric motor arranged in the attachment appliance V is effected by means of electrical contacts 8, which are brought into electrical contact or the reverse simultaneously with the operation of making the vacuum pipe connection.<br>
The aforementioned electrical contacts 8 extend outside of the cross section, surrounding the vacuum channel 9, of the vacuum pipe section 5 and complementary part 6. As a result the cross section for the vacuum pipe may be chosen which is optimal for flow and coupling. On the one hand it is desirable that the overall cross section should be as near circular as possible and on the other hand in particular the vacuum channel 9 should be as near circular in cross section as possible. With reference to the cross section of the vacuum channel 9, a preferred embodiment may be seen in Figure 16, in conjunction with the illustrations in Figures 17 and 18. As may be seen, with reference to the vacuum channel 9, this is based on gently curved surfaces which however do not prevent the rotational locking. The approximately oval shaped circumference includes in its widest region the cross section of the vacuum channel 9. The cross section with respect to the aforementioned area occupied by the electrical contacts 8 extends above the vacuum channel 9. The cross section is shaped for this purpose into a flattened area 10 which is a segment of a circle in the widest sense. The flattened area 10 extends in a gentle curve. It lies along an arc of a circle, the centrepoint of which is indicated by reference numeral 11. The centrepoint 11 extends in the vertical symmetrical<br><br>
plane x-x of  the cross section and lies appreciably outside the periphery 12 of the cross section and of the overall cross section.<br>
In the region of the abovementioned flattened area 10, the electrical contacts 8 extend outside of the cross section surrounding the vacuum channel 9. These are arranged above the flattened area 10 so as to be included in the externally essentially circu]ar  overall cross section. The electrical contacts 8 may even lie in a curved line. This curved line brings about a greater useful length in the mutually side by side arrangement of the electrical contacts 8 which may be seen in the drawings.<br>
With reference to the division of the area or  cross section for the functions of air flow and for those of the electrical supply the surface area of the first cross section is at least four times that of the section above the flattened area 10. Above the flattened area there is a plane which extends over the length of the vacuum pipe section 5 and complementary part 6, and which may comprise a gently outwardly curved surface 13. The surface 13 extends at right angles to the vertical symmetrical plane x-x. This gives the overall cross section the desired optically exact roundness, provides a surface which may be easily gripped, which ergonomically improves the feel of the coupling halves. Furthermore this brings about an advantageous height reduction in the overall cross section in the vertical direction. This allows greater access to the areas underneath furniture.<br>
Coming back to the curved surface 10, this comprises, as seen from inside the channel, a concave curved surface a, which is different to two curved surfaces b and c, which are also concave, connected to the ends thereof. The curved surfaces b and c are the same as one another. These extend as curved V arms and have a large concdive curvature at the vertex. The vertex is designated by reference numeral 14. The end transitions of these arms, that is to say the mirror image curved surfaces b and c, extend smoothly via surfaces 15 of smaller concave curvature into the roof-like curved upper surface a.<br>
The centrepoint 16 of the vertex 14 lies approximately in the centre of the vacuum channel 9, intersecting vertical section x-x. In contrast<br><br>
the centrepoint 17 of the narrower curved surfaces 15 lies on a horizontal connection 18 in the upper part of the height of the vacuum channel 9. These define at the intersection point a sharp angle Alpha of approximately 40°. The vertex point of this angle Alpha is provided hy  the centrepoint 11.<br>
The right angle designated by Beta in Figure 18 indicates curved surface connections 19 between the vertex 14 and the curved surfaces b and c. The centrepoint 16 marks the vertex of the right angle Beta.<br>
The extension of the angle arms of the sharp angle Alpha beyond the connection line 18, marks the connection points 20 between the narrow curved surfaces 15 and the upper curved surface a. The connection line 18 marks the other curved surface connection points 20' to the curved surfaces b and c.<br>
The projecting extension of the arms of the angle Beta beyond 18 produce at the intersecting points with the connection line 18 the centre point 16' for the radius of the curved surfaces b and c.<br>
In accordance with variant of Figure 16 a total of four electrical connections are provided. With reference to the essentially curved side by side arrangement shown therein, the two outermost positions are round pin plugs and round pin sockets 21. The two electric plug contact positions in between consist of two flat pins or two flat pin sockets 22. Alternatively these could also be two round pin plugs or round pin sockets, whether these are on the connector E or the connector socket A.<br>
The other variants give a triple combination while retaining the curved shaped embodiment of the electrical contacts 8. In this case only one contact point is used for the signal contact, while the other two are used for power supply.<br>
With reference to the male/female arrangement of the electrical contacts 8, the physical projections are designated with reference numeral 23 in Figure 9. The corresponding physical sockets, in the form of slits or bores for pins, may be seen in Figure 10, and bear the<br><br>
reference numeral 24.<br>
The plug sockets are arranged in an axially recessed position relative to a mouth cross section 25 of the vacuum pipe section 5, so that as a result the centring effect of the coupling means for attachment to the vacuum pipe may be used for a load free coupling of the electric conductors. Even a premature coupling/releasing operation is such that any remaining adhering dust cannot reach the region of the electrical coupling elements. The plug sockets are project proud of an external wall 26 of the vacuum pipe section 5. The underneath gap 27 between the block shaped socket for the electrical contacts 8 and the corresponding external side of the vacuum pipe section 5, is available for the entrance of a mating insertion wall 6 of the complementary 6.<br>
The mouth cross section 25 can, as may for example be seen in the variant according to Figure 10, be perpendicular to a longitudinal central axis y-y of the vacuum pipe section 5; preferably there is in any  case an inclined surface (Figure 12) with a corresponding opposite surface in the connector socket A of the complementary 6. The inclined rear section is at an acute angle gamma of approximately 20°. This allows for the possibility of coupling guidance. The inclination and the corresponding counter inclination even produce a connector centring and rotational correction. Furthermore a good support is provided in the fully home position of the plug. The coupling guide can also however be provided in the region of the external wall 26. Reference is made to Figure 12. There, as seen in the direction of attachment, the external wall 26 has a circumferential stepped shoulder 28. A co-operating mating shoulder 29 is located on the connector socket end of the complementary part 6. In the vacuum pipe section 5 which constitutes the connector E, the outer surfaces of the front wall 30 which carry the exposed electrical contacts can be adjusted to the optimum rotationally secure and supporting position. The shoulder supported coupling position is defined by the coupling joint F illustrated in Figure 6 between the connector E and the connector socket A. The vertex of the inclination of the mouth cross section 25 lies on  the flattened side (flattening 10).<br>
The active part of the vacuum pipe section 5 is removed. This is<br><br>
possible because the vacuum pipe section 5 to be introduced into the connector  socket A of the complementary part 6, has outer dimensions which increase stepwise, starting from the aforementioned mouth cross section 25. A wall layer may be used to provide the thickness of the wall, the outer surface of the latter encompassing the internal contour of the vacuum channel 9 in the active region. The step is indicated by reference numeral 31. The connector socket covers a part only of the larger step or the outer wall section of the connector which is connected to the step 31.<br>
The variant in accordance with Figure 2 shows a groove 32 in the region of the step transition. This serves to receive a sealing ring 33. This consists of a sealing ring having a V-section construction made of rubber or similar material. The V-opening of the sealing ring 33 extends in the opposite direction to the operational direction 3 of the connector E. The region of the step 31 is correspondingly shaped and meets the space requirement of the V-edge of the sealing ring 33. Starting from the sealing point, the cross sectional size of the vacuum pipe connector has a continuously gradually increasing diameter. Thus a support is provided at both ends, once by the foot of the part of greatest cross sectional dimensions of the vacuum pipe section 5 and in the region of the step 31 by means of the resilient supporting zone via sealing ring 33.<br>
The inclined front end, that is the mouth section 25 and the end zone which tapers as a result of the cross sectional geometry, allow the vacuum pipe section 5 to be used as a vacuum nozzle. In order to be able to support the expected amount of wear, appropriate arrangements are made. These consist of the following, the exposed diametrically smaller part of the vacuum pipe section 5 has an external sleeve. This sleeve 34 which offers an effective protection against wear is exchangeable, and for this reason is secured reversibly. It protects the front face without any narrowing of the cross section of the vacuum channel 9 and is fixed to the outer surface of the diametrically smaller part. This latter is provided with circumferentially distributed projecting stops 35 (see Figure 4). The projecting stops are disposed in a row and are equally spaced and also have the same area. The relatively resilient wear protector may be clipped on<br><br>
frontally without any difficulty, and on reaching the fully home position the projecting stops 35 engage in mating sockets 36 of the sleeve 34. The said sockets 36 may be seen in Figure 5. They are disposed coincident with the projecting stops 35. A conical collar 37 of the sleeve 34 facilitates connection, the collar 37 extends as far as the region of the aforementioned step 31 and there also undertakes the function of a sealing ring. The collar 37 is wedge shaped towards to its free end. A further feature to ensure secure connection is as follows, the vacuum pipe section 5 forms a circumferential rib 38 in the insertion direction 3 in the region of its mouth section 25. The exposed, knife like rib 38 defines an angle of approximately 30 . The mid-line of the angle may lie along the insertion direction to give equally arranged sides. The complement on the sleeve side has the appearance of a mating groove 39 in the sleeve 34. The rib 38 mates with this latter. The mechanical strain at the edge is normally not sufficient to loosen the wear protector from the front end. On the other hand a definite pull permits a defective sleeve 34 to be replaced by using the resilient strength of the material for the desired end connection. The sockets 36 may be pockets or, as illustrated, windows.<br>
Reverting to the step profile of the vacuum pipe section 5 it remains to be confirmed that the complementary part 6, that is to say the connector socket A has a stepwise taper 40 for mating with the cross section of the vacuum pipe. The opposing surface which corresponds to the extent of the mouth section 25 is designated 41.<br>
Protective cable channels extend backwardly from the contact points of the electrical contacts 8, The strict separation and the separate power supply channel allow damp and wet matter to be vacuumed.<br>
The coupling connection is lockable. A device, illustrated in Figure 8, is provided for this purpose comprising a locking plate 42 which is spring biassed in the direction of closure. The latter is pivotal about a horizontal axis 43 in the connector 4 and grips from behind a complementary shoulder of the complementary part 6 with downwardly operational detents 44 arranged in a pair. The detents extend at the side of the electrical contacts 8, and there make use of the free space on the front wall of the vacuum pipe section 5. A chamber 45 for<br><br>
receiving the operational region of the double armed locking plate 42 extends from the upper, planar surface 13 of the vacuum pipe section 5. Gripping slots (not shown) are provided in the front wall 30 for the free arms of the detents 44.<br>
Requirements for the external profile:<br>

2-  All upper surfaces of the profile have a convex curvature. The maximum radius of curvature is 60 mm.<br>
3.	The shape includes a vertical linear axis of symmetry (Plane x-x).<br>
4.	The linear elements extend tangentially into one another.<br>
5.	A planar surface, which extends perpendicularly to the symmetry axis x-x, facilitates recognition. At the transition to the other surfaces the tangential requirement is not fulfilled.<br>
Result:<br>
The shape comprises a combination of at least four linear elements.<br>
