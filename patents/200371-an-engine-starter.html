				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to an engine starter for transmitting the rotation of an armature to an output shaft and transmitting rotation of the output shaft to a pinion through an over-running clutch, thereby starting an engine, and more particularly, to a starter having a retainer ring for stopping the rearward motion of an over-rurming clutch.<br>
Fig. 9 is a side elevational view, partly in cross section, showing a conventional starter. The starter 100 includes an output shaft 8 to which the rotation of an armature is transmitted, an over-running clutch 20 coupled with the output shaft 8 through helical splines 8a and 21a, and two retainer rings 24 for retaining the over-running clutch 20 having retracted and returned.<br>
The output shaft 8 includes a large diameter portion 8b at the rear end thereof as the armature side. The over-running clutch 20 is composed of a clutch outer 21, which is coupled with the output shaft 8 by the helical splines 8a and 21a, and an clutch inner 22, which is coupled with the clutch outer 21 through a roller 23 and transmits rotation in one direction to a pinion 26 at a front end.<br><br>
A helical spline is composed of the output shaft helical spline 8a, which is a convex portion extending spirally in an axis direction and formed on the output shaft 8, and the clutch outer helical spline 21a, which is a concave portion formed to the clutch outer 21 and engaged with the output shaft helical spline 8a. The over-running clutch 20 is advanced and retracted on the output shaft 8 by a shift lever 25. Then, the over-running clutch 20 advances and retracts and returns the pinion 26 disposed at the front end.<br>
The two retainer rings 24 are E-shaped retainer rings shown in Fig. 10 and fitted on the output shaft 8 between the large diameter portion 8b of the output shaft 8 and the over-running clutch 20. The two retainer rings 24 are stacked in the axial direction. Then, the retainer rings 24 are abutted against the rear end of the clutch outer 21 having retracted and returned so as to receive the axial load thereof. The two retainer rings 24 may be replaced with one retainer ring having a large thickness. However, a predetermined thickness and a predetermined strength are obtained by the two retainer rings 24 because it is difficult to make an E-shaped retainer ring having a large thickness.<br>
Next, operation will be described. Turning on the start switch of an engine of a vehicle and the like<br><br>
energizes the not shown exciting coil of an electromagnetic switch and a not shown plunger is drawn and retracted inwardly so that the shift lever 25 is rotated counterclockwise in Fig. 9. Then, the over-running clutch<br>
20	is moved forward. With this operation, the pinion 26 is<br>
meshed with the ring gear of the engine. Thereafter, the<br>
armature rotates and the rotational force thereof is<br>
transmitted to the output shaft 8. The rotation of the<br>
armature is further transmitted to the pinion 2 6 through the<br>
over-running clutch 20 so as to start the engine by rotating<br>
the ring gear thereof.<br>
When the engine starts, the engine rotating at high speed drives the pinion 26 in the same direction as the engine. However, the driving force is not transmitted to the armature by the existence of the over-running clutch 20.<br>
When the engine starts and then the start switch is turned off, the plunger of the electromagnetic switch 110 is advanced and returned so as to rotate clockwise and return the shift lever. As a result, the over-running clutch 20 is retracted and returned. At this time, when the clutch outer<br>
21	receives a large rearward thrust force, the retainer<br>
rings 24 may be broken.<br>
In the starter 100 constructed as described above, the two retainer rings 24 may be offset in a rotational direction by the vibration of the vehicle and the rotation<br><br>
of the over-running clutch 20 as shown in Fig. 11. When the two retainer rings 24 are offset m the rotational direction of the shaft as described above, they are repeatedly subjected to an axial load generated when the over-running clutch 20 is retracted and returned and may be broken.<br>
An object of the present invention, which was made to solve the above problem, is to provide a starter capable of preventing the breakage of a retainer ring for stopping the retracting motion of an over-running clutch.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides an engine starter comprising an output shaft to which the rotation of an armature is transmitted and which comprises a large diameter portion formed at the rear end thereof, an overÂ¬running clutch having a clutch outer coupled with the output shaft through helical splines and an inner rmg coupled with the clutch outer through a roller for transmitting rotation in one direction to a pinion at a front end to thereby advance and retract and return the pinion, and a plurality of retainer rings fitted on the output shaft between the large diameter portion of the output shaft and the over-runnmg clutch and stacked in an axial direction so as to receive the rear end of the clutch outer having retracted and returned, characterized in that a projection and a recess, which are engaged with each other so as to prevent the mutual movement thereof in a rotational direction, are formed to each of the plurality of retainer rings.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Embodiment 1<br>
Fig. 1 is a front elevational view of an E-shaped retainer ring as each of two retainer rings 31 showing a starter of an embodiment 1 of the present invention. Fig. 2 is a sectional view taken along the line A - A of Fig. 1 showing the two retainer rings 31. Fig. 3 is a side elevational view showing a state in which the two retainer rings 31 are fitted on an output shaft. NotK-that the construction of the starter other than that shown in the figures is the same as that of the conventional starter.<br>
The retainer rings 31 of the embodiment 1 are made by, for example, stamping or the like and formed in an E-shape. Then, a projection 31a is formed at the center of each E-shaped ring. Further, a recess 31b is formed on the back surface of the projection 31a. The projection 31a formed on one of the two retainer rings 31 is engaged with the recess<br><br>
31b formed on the other retainer ring 31.<br>
As shown in Fig. 3, the two retainer rings 31 are fitted in a groove 8c formed on the output shaft 8 as shown in Fig. 3. The groove 8c has such a width that even if the positions of the two retainer rings 31 are widened in the axial direction of the output shaft 8, the groove 8c regulates the retainer rings 31 so that the projection 31a is not disengaged from the recess 31b. As a result, the projection 31a is not removed from the recess 31b even if a vehicle vibrates or even if the over-running clutch 20 rotates.<br>
In the starter constructed as described above, the two retainer rings 31 are not offset in a rotational direction even by the vibration of the vehicle and the rotation of the over-running clutch 20. Accordingly, the retainer rings 31 are not broken even if they are repeatedly subjected an axial load generated when the over-running clutch 20 is retracted and returned.<br>
Note that while the two retainer rings 31 are provided in  1i4&gt;c in the embodiment 1, the number of them is not limited to two and three or more retainer rings 31 may be provided when necessary. Embodiment 2<br>
Fig. 4 is a front elevational view of an E-shaped retainer ring as each of two retainer rings 32 showing the<br><br>
starter of an embodiment 2 of the present invention. Each retainer ring 32 of the embodiment 2 has a square projection 32a formed at the center thereof. Then, a recess, which has a square shape likewise and is engaged with the projection 32a, is formed on the back surface of the projection 32a.<br>
In the starter constructed as described above, the two retainer rings 32 have an increased degree of engagement and are more difficult to be offset. Accordingly, it is more difficult for the retainer rings 32 to be broken. Embodiment 3<br>
Fig. 5 is a front elevational view of an E-shaped retainer ring as each of retainer rings 33 showing the starter of an embodiment 3 of the present invention. Each retainer ring 33 of the embodiment 3 has a triangular projection 33a formed at the center thereof. Then, a recess, which has a triangular shape likewise and is engaged with the projection 33a, is formed on the back surface of the projection 33a.<br>
In the starter constructed as described above, the two retainer rings 33 have an increased degree of engagement and are more difficult to be offset. Accordingly, it is more difficult for the retainer rings 32 to be broken. Embodiment 4<br>
Fig. 6 is a front elevational view of an E-shaped retainer ring as each of two retainer rings 34 showing a<br><br>
starter of an embodiment 4 of the present invention. Each retainer ring 34 of the embodiment 4 has three projections 34a formed at the center and both the ends thereof. Then, recesses, which are engaged with the respective three projections 34a, are formed on the back surfaces thereof.<br>
In the starter constructed as described above, the two retainer rings 34 are engaged well with each other, a degree of engagement thereof is more increased and they are more difficult to be offset. Accordingly, it is more difficult for the retainer rings 34 to be broken. Embodiment 5<br>
Fig. 7 is a front elevational view of an E-shaped retainer ring as each of two retainer rings 35 showing a starter of an embodiment 5 of the present invention. Fig. 8 is a sectional view taken along the line C - C of Fig. 7 showing the two retainer rings 35. Each retainer ring 35 of the embodiment 5 has a projection 35a formed on the outer circumferential edge thereof at the center thereof. Then, a recess, which is engaged with the projection 35a, is formed on the back surface of the projection 35a.<br>
In the starter constructed as described above, the projection 35a and the recess 35b are formed on the outer circumferential edge of each retainer ring 35, thus the retainer rings 35 can be easily formed as well as they are more difficult to be offset in the rotational direction.<br><br>
which makes it more difficult for the retainer rings 35 to be broken.<br><br><br>
