This application claims the benefit of 5     provisional application serial number 60/038,346 filed Feb. 28, 1997<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to compositions of matter classified in the art of chemistry as fluoropolymers,<br>
10     more specifically as copolymers of vinylidene fluoride (VDF), more specifically as copolymers of vinylidene fluoride and hexafluoropropylene (HFP), still more specifically as copolymers of VDF and HFP having reduced extractable content, lonqer get times and<br>
15     improved solution claritv, to novel compositions of matter and articles of manufacture containing such copolymers, as well as to processes for the preparation and use of the copolymers, of compositions of manufacture containing such copolymers and of the<br>
-1A-<br><br>
articles of  manufacture contaning such <br>
VDF/HFP copolymers are well known and are used for their thermoplastic engineering properties, chemical resistance and inertness toward degradation. They may be found in applications such as chemically 5     resistant piping, gasketing, plenum cable jacketing, filtration and extraction membranes and in the construction of lithium batteries.<br>
The present invention provides VDF/HFP copolymers containing up to about 24 weiqht % (12 mole%) HFP<br>
10     having among other improved properties substantially improved solution charity, longer gel times and reduced extractables as these terms are defined hereinafter.<br>
The process used to make the instant copolymers<br>
15     requires one ratio of VDF and HFP for the initial fill of the reactor, and a different ratio of VDF and HFP during a subsequent continuous feed of the monomers. Any particular desired average HFP content in the copolymer product has corresponding particular initial<br>
20     fill and subsequent feed ratios.  The uniformity of compositions prepared this way provide unique and useful properties in comparison to VDF/HFP copolymers described in the prior art.<br>
The present invention also provides lithium<br>
25     batteries fabricated from the VDF/HFP copolymers of<br>
the present invention and lithium batteries from other homo and copolymers more specifically described hereinbelow prepared by known processes having analogous structure and which the present inventors<br>
- 2    -<br><br>
have recognized as processing properties analogous to those of the VDF/HFP copolymers of the invention which makes them uniquely suitable for lithium battery construction.<br>
DISCLOSURE   OF   PRIOR  ART<br>
	Rexford in U.S. Pat. No. 3,051,677 described<br>
VDF/HFP copolymers of HFP content 30 to 70 wt% (15 to 50 mol%) which showed utility as elastomers.  To make the copolymers, a batch process with certain initial ratios of VDF and HFP, and a continuous process with<br>
     fixed ratios of VDF and HFP throughout the process were described.  The processes described were such that polymers lackinq the improved solution claritv, longer gel times and low extractables of the present invention were made.<br>
  	Lo in U.S. Pat. No. 3,178,399 described VDF/HFP<br>
copolymers of HFP content of 2 to 26 wt% (1 to 13 mol%) which showed a numerical value for the product of the tensile strength (psig) and percent reversible elongation of at least 1,000,000.  A batch process<br>
       with certain initial ratios of VDF and HFP, or, alternately, a semicontinuous process with fixed ratios of VDF and HFP throughout the process were used to make the copolymers.  The processes discussed were such that copolymers lacking the improved solution<br>
       clarity, longer gel times and low extractables of the present invention copolymers were made.<br>
Moggi, et al. in Polymer Bulletin 7, 115-122 (1982) analyzed the microstructure and crystal structure of VDF/HFP copolymers by nuclear magnetic<br>
- 3 -<br><br>
resonance and x-ray diffraction experiments.  The copolymers of up to 31 wt% (up to 16 mol%) HFP were made in a batch emulsion process which was carried only to low conversion.  While the low conversion batch process is capable of producing copolymers having solution clarity and low extractables, no such properties are described.  It is not a practical process for industrial use because of the low conversions required to make the materials.  In addition, no detailed polymerization examples were offered.<br>
Bonardelli et al. in Polymer, vol. 27, 905-909 (June 1986) studied the glass transition temperatures of VDF/HFP copolymers having HFP content up to 62 wt.% (up to 41 mol%).  The glass transition temperatures were correlated to the overall HFP content in the copolymers.  In making the copolymers for analysis, a semicontinuous emulsion process was used which employed different VDF/HFP ratios for the initial fill of the reactor and for the subsequent continuous feed of monomers.  Although reference was made to the use of reactivity ratios to set the VDF/HFP ratio for the initial fill, no detailed polymerization examples were offered, and no mention of copolymers having solution clarity, gel times and low extractables comparable to that of the copolymers of the present invention was<br>
made .<br>
Pianca et al. in Polymer, vol. 28, 224-230 (Feb. 1987) examined the microstructure of VDF/HFP copolymers by nuclear magnetic resonance, and the<br><br>
microstructure determinations were used to explain the trend in glass transition temperatures of the copolymers.  The synthesis of the copolymers involved a semicontinuous emulsion process which used different VDF/HFP ratios for the initial fill of the reactor and 5     for the subsequent continuous feed of monomers.  No detailed synthesis examples were provided, and there was no discussion of copolymers having improved solution claritv, longer gel times and low extractables as provided by the copolymers of the<br>
10     present invention.<br>
Abusleme et al. in Eur. Pat. Appl. No. 650,982 Al showed an emulsion process to make polymers and copolymers of fluorinated olefins optionally with one or more non-fluorinated olefins.  The process relied<br>
15     on photochemical initiation of polymerization so that lower temperatures and pressures could be used than those used for thermally initiated processes.  While there was general mention of the structural regularity of the resulting polymers, the only evidence of<br>
20     regularity concerned poly(vinylidene fluoride)<br>
homopolymer, and no claims were made as to regularity of composition.  Examples of VDF/HFP copolymerization were given, put no discussion of the solution extraction properties of the copolymers was given, and<br>
25     there was no relation made between physical properties and the structure of the VDF/HFP copolymers.<br>
Morgan in U.S. Pat. No. 5,543,217 disclosed uniform tetrafluoroethylene/hexafluoropropylene copolymers (TFE/HFP copolymers) made by a<br>
- 5 -<br><br>
semicontinuous emulsion process.  Uniformity was simply defined as there being a low proportion of adjacent HFP units in the polymer chains; there was no disclosure of the disposition of TFE and HFP units otherwise, and there was no discussion of VDF/HFP copolymers or the properties to be expected therefrom.<br>
None of these references teaches or suggests a way to obtain VDF/HFP copolymers having solvent solution clarity and fluidity, longer gel times and low extractables comparable to the VDF/HFP copolymers of the instant invention or that such properties are attainable from VDF/HFP copolymers.<br>
U.S. Patent 4,076,929 describes the synthesis of VDF homopolymer having a uniformly distributed relatively high defect structure in its molecular claims.<br>
U.S. Patent 2,752,331 describes the synthesis of VDF-chlorotrifluoroethylene(CTFE) copolymers having a high uniformity of comonomer distribution in its molecular claims.<br>
Baggett and Smith in High  Polymers,   Vol. XVIII, Ham, John Wiley (1964), Chapter X, Copolymerization, pp 587 et seq., particularly at pages 593 and 610 describe the synthesis of uniform composition distribution copolymers of vinylidene chloride and vinyl chloride and vinyl chloride and vinyl acetate.<br>
U. S. Patent 5,296,318 teaches that only VDF/HFP copolymers having 8 to 25% by weight HFP and no other VDF homo- or copolymers are suitable for use in fabrication of lithium battery electrodes and<br><br>
separators.<br><br>
U.S. Patent 5,348,818 mentions that among other polymers, VDF polymer may be used in forming a solid electrolyte for use in secondary bayyery manufacture. No particular type of polyvinylidene fluoride is identified and no copolymers thereof of any type are suggested.<br>
European Patent Application 95 120 660.6-1215 published September 4, 1996 teaches use of micro porous (open or closed cell) VDF copolymers of about 7% to about 25% comonomer content in lithium batteries and the use of VDF homopolymer as a cladding material for such batteries.  Use of copolymers used by the instant invention in solid electrolytes and the improved properties provided thereby are not taught or      suggested.  Similarly the use of the type of VDF<br>
homopolymer used in the present invention in solid electrolytes is not taught of suggested.<br>
None of these references teach or suggest lithium rocking chair batteries of the type contemplated by the present invention and U.S. Patent 5,296,318 expressly teaches away from use of VDF homopolymer of any type, VDF/HFP copolymers of less than 8% by weight HFP content or other VDF containing copolymers.<br>
U.S. Patent 5,571,634 teaches a lithium ion battery construction employing a VDF-CTFE copolymer where the CTFE content in the copolymer is no less than 8% by weight.<br>

The disclosures of the PCT application, the European application and the U.S. Patent are hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
In addition to use of solution casting techniques for preparation of films for use in battery constructions as described in the aforementioned references, use of extrusion techniques to prepare such films and the batteries fabricated therefrom are also contemplated.<br>
It has also been noted that batteries fabricated from the above described VDF polymers, particularly the VDF-HFP copolymers of the present invention, have better adhesion of the polymers to metallic portions   of electrodes and higher use temperatures than    batteries fabricated from VDF-HFP copolymers of the prior art. It has also been observed that VDF-HFP copolymers of the present invention provide batteries having improved electrical properties including the     /<br>

capability of higher discharge rates than batteries<br>
fabricated from VDF-HFP copolymers of the prior art.<br>

The invention provides in a third composition<br>
aspect, a solution of a composition of the first<br>
composition aspect of the invention having improved<br>
solution clarity and fluidity.<br>
10	Copolymers of vinylidene fluoride and<br>
hexafluoropropylene of up to about 24 wt% hexafluoropropylene are useful semicrystalline thermoplastics.  As the HFP content, increases in the materials, the crystallinity decreases, and, 15     correspondingly, the flexibility and solvent<br>
20<br>
25<br>
sensitivity increase.  Other properties change as well, such as the final melting point, which decreases with increasing HFP content.  In high-purity applications such as membrane filtration or extraction, lithium battery construction, high-transparency film from solution casting, and fluid storage and transport requiring low contaminant levels, it is desirable to have materials with low levels of extractables, little gel formation in the presence of solvent, and good clarity.  The VDF/HFP copolymers provided here show lower extractables, improved solution properties, improved clarity and fluidity, and lower melting points in comparison to the nonuniform VDF/HFP copolymers of otherwise similar<br>
- 13 -<br><br>
HFP content and manufacture known in the prior art. DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION The invention provides copolymers of vinylidene 20     fluoride and hexafluoropropylene having hexafluoro-propylene content of up to about 24 wt% and having improved solution clarity and fluidity and reduced extractables.  The copolymers are conveniently made by an emulsion polymerization process, but suspension and 25     solution processes may also be used.  In an emulsion polymerization process a reactor is charged with deionized water, water-soluble surfactant capable of emulsifying the reaction mass during polymerization, -paraffin antifoulant, vinylidene fluoride,<br>
- 14 -<br><br>
hexafluoropropylene, chain-transfer agent to control copolymer molecular weight, and initiator to start and maintain the polymerization.  To obtain the VDF/HFP copolymers of the present invention, the initial charge of VDF and HFP monomers is such that the amount 5     of HFP is up to 48% of the combined weight of the<br>
monomers initially charged, and then VDF and HFP are fed continuously throughout the reaction such that the amount of the HFP is up to 24% of the combined weight of the monomers fed continuously.  The VDF/HFP ratios<br>
     are different in the initial charge and during the continuous feed, and each final polymer composition has definite and related ratios for the initial charge and continuous feed.  The process uses total amounts of VDF and HFP monomers such that the amount of HFP<br>
     used is up to about 24% of the combined total weight of the monomers.<br>
The reactor is a pressurized polymerization reactor equipped with a stirrer and heat control means.  The temperature of the polymerization can vary<br>
20     depending on the characteristics of the initiator<br>
used, but it is typically between 65° and 105°C, and most conveniently it is between 75° and 95°C.  The temperature is not limited to this range, however, and might be higher or lower if a high-temperature or low-<br>
25      temperature initiator is used.  The VDF/HFP ratios used in the polymerization will be dependent on the temperature chosen for reaction.  The pressure of the polymerization is typically between 2750 and 6900 kPa, but it can be higher if the equipment permits<br>
- 15 -<br><br>
operation at higher pressure.  The pressure is most conveniently between 3790 and 5860 kPa.<br>
Surfactants used in the polymerization are water-soluble, halogenated surfactants, especially fluorinated surfactants such as the ammonium, 5     substituted ammonium, quaternary ammonium, or alkali<br>
metal salts of perfluorinated or partially fluorinated alkyl carboxylates, the perfluorinated or partially fluorinated monoalkyl phosphate esters, the perfluorinated or partially fluorinated alkyl ether or'<br>
10     polyether carboxylates, the perfluorinated or<br>
partially fluorinated alkyl sulfonates, and the perfluorinated or partially fluorinated alkyl sulfates.  Some specific, but not limiting examples are the salts of the acids described in U.S. Pat. No.<br>
15      2,559,752 of the formula X(CF2)nCOOM, wherein X is<br>
hydrogen or fluorine, M is an alkali metal, ammonium, substituted ammonium (e.g., alkylamine of 1 to 4 carbon atoms), or quaternary ammonium ion, and n is an integer from 6 to 20; sulfuric acid esters of<br>
20     polyfluoroalkanols of the formula X(CF2)nCH2OSO3M,<br>
where X and M are as above; and salts of the acids of the formula CF3(CF2)n(CX2)mSO3M Whare x and M are as above, n is an integer from 3 to 7, and m is an integer from 0 to 2, such as in potassium<br>
25     perfluorooctyl sulfonate.  The surfactant charge is<br>
from 0.05% to 2% by weight on the total monomer weight used, and most preferably the surfactant charge is from 0.1% to 0.2% by weight.<br>
The paraffin antifoulant is conventional, and any<br>
- 16 -<br><br>
long-chain, saturated, hydrocarbon wax or oil may be used.  Reactor loadings of the paraffin are from 0.01% to 0.3% by weight on the total monomer weight used.<br>
After the reactor has been charged with deionized water, surfactant, and paraffin antifoulant, the 5     reactor is either purged with nitrogen or evacuated to remove oxygen.  The reactor is brought to temperature, and chain-transfer agent may optionally be added.  The reactor is then pressurized with a mixture of vinylidene fluoride and hexafluoropropylene.<br>
10	Chain-transfer agents which may be used are well-<br>
known in the polymerization of fluorinated monomers. Alcohols, carbonates, ketones, esters, and ethers are oxygenated compounds which serve as chain-transfer agents.  Specific, but not limiting examples, are<br>
15     isopropyl alcohol, such as described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,360,652, acetone, such as described in U.S. Pat. No. 3,857,827, and ethyl acetate, as described in the Published Unexamined Application (Kokai) JP 58065711. Other classes of compounds which serve as chain-<br>
20     transfer agents in the polymerization of fluorinated monomers are halocarbons and hydrohalocarbons such as chlorocarbons, hydrochlorocarbons,<br>
chlorofluorocarbons, and hydrochlorofluoro-carbons; specific, but not limiting examples are<br>
25      trichlorofluoromethane, such as described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,569,978, and 1,l-dichloro-2,2,2-trifluoroethane. Chain-transfer agents may be added all at once at the beginning of the reaction, in portions throughout the reaction, or continuously as the reaction progresses.<br>
- 17 -<br><br>
The amount of chain-transfer agent and mode of addition which is used depends on the activity of the agent and the desired molecular weight characteristics of the product.  The amount of chain-transfer agent used is from 0.05% to 5% by weight on the total<br>
5     monomer weight used, and preferably it is from 0.1 to 2% by weight.<br>
The reactor is pressurized by adding vinylidene fluoride and hexafluoropropylene monomers in a definite ratio (first effective ratio) such that the<br>
0     hexafluoropropylene ranges up to 48% of the combined weight of the monomers initially charged.  The first effective ratio used will depend on the relative reactivity of the two monomers at the polymerization temperature chosen.  The reactivity of vinylidene<br>
5     fluoride and hexafluoropropylene has been reported in Bonardelli et al., Polymer, vol. 27, 905-909 (June 1986).  The relative reactivity is such that to obtain a particular uniform copolymer composition, more hexafluoropropylene has to be charged to the reactor<br>
0     in the initial fill than will be incorporated into the copolymer.  At the convenient polymerization temperature range of this invention, about twice as much hexafluoropropylene has to be charged to the reactor in the initial fill as will appear in the<br>
5     polymer.<br>
The reaction can be started and maintained by the addition of any suitable initiator known for the polymerization of fluorinated monomers including inorganic peroxides, "redox" combinations of oxidizing<br>
- 18 -<br><br>
and reducing agents, and organic peroxides.  Examples of typical inorganic peroxides are the ammonium or alkali metal salts of persulfates, which have useful activity in the 65°C to 105°C temperature range. "Redox" systems can operate at even lower temperatures and examples include combinations of oxidants such as hydrogen peroxide, t-butyl hydroperoxide, cumene hydroperoxide, or persulfate, and reductants such as reduced metal salts, iron (II) salts being a particular example, optionally combined with activators such as sodium formaldehyde sulfoxylate or ascorbic acid.  Among the organic peroxides which can be used for the polymerization are the classes of dialkyl peroxides, peroxyesters, and peroxydicarbonates .  Exemplary of dialkyl peroxides is di-t-butyl peroxide, of peroxyesters are t-butyl peroxypivalate and t-amyl peroxypivalate, and of peroxydicarbonates are di(n-propyl) peroxydicarbonate, diisopropyl peroxydicarbonate, di(sec-butyl) peroxydicarbonate, and di(2-ethylhexyl) peroxydicarbonate.  The use of diisopropyl peroxydicarbonate for vinylidene fluoride polymerization and copolymerization with other fluorinated monomers is taught in U.S. Pat. No. 3,475,396, and its use in making vinylidene fluoride/hexafluoropropylene copolymers is further illustrated in U.S. Pat. No. 4,360,652.  The use of di(n-propyl) peroxydicarbonate in vinylidene fluoride polymerizations is described in the Published Unexamined Application (Kokai) JP 58065711.  The quantity of an initiator required for a<br><br>
polymerization is related to its activity and the temperature used for the polymerization.  The total amount of initiator used is generally between 0.05% to 2.5% bv weight on the total monomer weight used. Typically, sufficient initiator is added at the 5     beginning to start the reaction and then additional initiator may be optionally added to maintain the polymerization at a convenient rate.  The initiator may be added in pure form, in solution, in suspension, or in emulsion, depending upon the initiator chosen.<br>
10     As a particular example, peroxydicarbonates are<br>
conveniently added in the form of an aqueous emulsion.<br>
As the reaction progresses, a mixture of vinylidene fluoride and hexafluoropropylene monomers is fed in a definite ratio ( second effective ratio)<br>
15     so as to maintain reaction pressure.  The second<br>
effective ratio used corresponds to the monomer unit ratio desired in the final composition of the copolymer, and it can range up to 24% of the combined weight of the monomers being fed continuously<br>
20     throughout the reaction.  The feed of vinylidene fluoride, hexafluoropropylene, and optionally initiator and chain-transfer agent is continued until the desired reactor fill is obtained.<br>
Upon reaching the desired reactor fill, the<br>
25     monomer feeds are terminated.  To achieve the<br>
copolymer having optimum solution clarity and minimal extractables, all other feeds are stopped at the same time as the monomer feeds, and the reactor is vented as soon as is practicable.  Alternatively, to achieve<br>
- 20 -<br><br>
highest yield at the expense of solution clarity and extractables, a react-out period to consume residual monomer is used with optional continuation of initiator feed.  For react-out, the reaction temperature and agitation are maintained for a period 5     of 20 to 30 minutes, but a longer period can be used if required in order to consume monomer to the point where the reactor pressure is no longer falling to any significant degree.  A settling period of typically 10 to 40 minutes may be used following the react-out<br>
10     period.  During the settling period, temperature is<br>
maintained but no initiator feed is used.  The reactor is then cooled and vented.<br>
The product is recovered as a latex.  To obtain dry resin, the latex is coagulated, the coagulum is<br>
15     separated and the separated coagulum may be washed. To provide powder, the coagulum is dried.<br>
For the coagulation step, several well-known methods can be used including freezing, the addition of acids or salts, or mechanical shear with optional<br>
20 heating. The powder, if desired, can be further processed into pellets or other convenient resin forms.<br>
The electrochemical cells of the present invention are based on. a positive electrode, an<br>
25     absorber-separator sometimes referred as a solid electrolyte and negative electrode operatively associated with one another wherein at least one of the electrodes or the absorber-separator, and preferably both electrodes and the absorber-separator<br>
- 21 -<br><br>
comprise a vinvlidene fluoride polymer of the present invention and wherein the vinylidene fluoride polymer of the present invention electrodes have an electrode material combined therewith and the vinylidene fluoride polymer of the present invention absorber-5     separator has an electrolyte material combined<br>
therewith.  A plurality of electrodes and absorber-separator elements can be used in the cell structure in order to increase the voltage, and/or amperage of the combined elements in a manner well known to the<br>
10     art.<br>
Vinylidene fluoride polymer of the present invention is not required to have an open or closed porous structure for operability.  It provides enhanced" electrolyte mobility in. combination with the<br>
15     intrinsic ionic conductivity effects of the polymer<br>
regardless of its initial porous or non porous state. Vinylidene fluoride electrode or separator-absorber combined with electrode or electrolyte materials at the surface of the pores of the porous polymer was<br>
20     previously believed to make the utilization of the active material, whether electrode material or electrolyte material more efficient and provide a method for the easy manufacture of the efficient electrodes and separator-absorber structures.  There<br>
25     are, however, other advantages to use of porous polymer structures even for the polyvinylidene fluoride polymers of the present invention.<br>
It is also believed that the segregation of the active materials on the surface of active pores will<br>
- 22 -<br><br>
allow for varying the amount of binder in the electrode of the separator-absorber to enhance strength with minimum effect on cell performance.  The electrochemical cells formed in this way therefore will have improved mechanical properties and can be<br>
5     made to be self-supporting i.e., secondary reinforcing structures do not have to be employed such as a metal or other conventional battery casing material.<br>
This also leads to ease of fabrication where the electrochemical cell is enveloped or enclosed in a<br>
0     vinylidene fluoride homopolymer which will adhere to the porous electrodes and/or the absorber-separator structures.  Adhesion can be obtained by simple heat bonding or radio frequency (rf) welding or other similar processes well known in the art.  Adhesives<br>
5     are not required, but importantly, the exterior part<br>
of the electrochemical cell (i.e., the envelope) is of the same type or a substantially similar type of material as the electrodes and absorber-separator and is more compatible therewith and adherent thereto,<br>
0     thereby simplifying and reducing the cost of<br>
manufacture in that only one type of material is used for the structural components' of the cell as compared to either conventional dry cell or secondary cell construction.<br>
5	Polyvinylidene fluoride in general absorbs rf<br>
frequency and may also be heated by dielectric techniques.  Heat guns may also be used for sealing polyvinylidene fluoride surfaces under pressure, Welding rods may also be employed to heat seal two<br>
- 23 -<br><br>
pieces easily as is done in the fabrication of larger polyvinylidene fluoride structures.  The joints obtained are usually as strong as the basic resins employed.  Because polyvinylidene fluoride polymers are abrasion resistant and tough as well as chemical resistant, they are useful in the internal and external element of the battery and, as noted previously, can be assembled by non-adhesive means by heat bonding.<br>
10<br>
By selecting vinylidene fluoride polymers of the present invention for electrodes and such polymers or conventional VDF polymer for cladding that are either extremely flexible or somewhat rigid, structures can be fabricated that are in turn either flexible or somewhat rigid.  Further in this regard, enhanced.<br>
15     rigidity can be obtained by cross-linking the<br>
vinylidene fluoride homo- or copolymers in general either chemically, but preferably by employing high energy radiation such as high energy (about 10 to about 20 Mrad) electron beam radiation, with some<br>
20     attendant dehydrofluorination.  One potential benefit is the further stabilization of the amorphous regions in the vinylidene fluoride polymers, i.e., inhibitions of crystallization over time which is important since ionic conductivity of the electrolyte is believed to<br>
25     occur primarily in the amorphous or open regions.<br>
As noted previously, vinylidene fluoride polymers in general affect ionic conductivity in a manner that makes them suitable for the fabrication of electrochemical cells.<br>
30	Since mobility of charged species is required in<br>
24<br><br>
electrochemical cells, it is believed that the migration of charged species in polyvinylidene' fluoride polymers will be through the amorphous phase. The vinylidene fluoride polymers of the present invention have been  recognized by the invention as having enhanced amorphous phases which are more stable and particularly for the HFP and CTFE copolymers provide this benefit to conductivity and the like at lower comonomer levels, thus, providing solubility and temperature advantages approaching that of homopolymers,<br>
In the triboelectric series, most polymers<br>
stabilize electrons.  Vinylidene fluoride polymers,<br>
however, are unique in stabilizina positive holes., and<br>
are one of the most effective media in this regard,<br>
presumably due to the highly negative gem-	<br>
difluorocarbon group.<br>
In the special case of lithium ion batteries such as the rocking-chair batteries described herein, the high specific charge and small ionic size of the lithium ion may lead to specific interactions in the host vinylidene fluoride polymer environment, considering the extent of the non-polarizable, negative gem-difluorocarbon groups available.<br>
Since conductivity is inversely related to crystallinity of the polyvinylidene fluoride polymer, it has been determined that conventional copolymers of vinylidene fluoride with about 7 to about 25% hexafluoropropylene sufficiently reduce the crystalline structure of the polymer without<br>
- 25 -<br><br>
sacrificing mechanical properties so that acceptable ionic conductivity effects of the polymer can be obtained.  The inventors have discovered that the vinylidene fluoride polymers of the present invention provide benefits equal to or better than the above conventional VDF/HFP copolymers at comonomer levels ' below 8% by weight, preferably below 6% by weight.<br>
When employing vinylidene fluoride polymers of the present invention in the manufacture of electrodes or absorber-separators, plasticizers such as organic carbonates (e.g., ethylene carbonate, propylene carbonate, dimethyicarbonate and the like) are utilized in order to minimize the effect of the crystalline structure and promote ionic conductivity. Other solvents or plasticizers may also be employed including diethoxyethane, diethylcarbonate, dimethoxyethane, dipropyl carbonate and mixtures thereof especially the two or three component mixtures.<br>
Similarly, and in accord with the present invention, the various porous or non-porous structures, depending on the their tensile strength, can be mechanically oriented by stretching or the application of tensile forces in order to enhance the amount of beta conformation within the polymer structure and thereby possibly promote ionic conductivity depending upon the electrolyte and polyvinylidene fluoride composition.<br>
Using solvent and non-solvent combinations, polyvinylidene fluoride polymers of the present<br>

s<br>
invention are cast in thin membranes.  This method, i described by Benzinger et al. in U.S. Patent No. 4,384,047 which is incorporated herein by reference. The electrode materials or the electrolyte materials as described herein can be incorporated into 5     polyvinylidene fluoride solution prior to casting it<br>
into a film or sheet, after which the solution may, if desired, be converted to a porous polyvinylidene fluoride membrane combined with the electrode of electrolyte materials.  These films or sheets, either 10     with or without the electrode or electrolyte materials can be any where from about 0.25 to about 100, particularly from about 0.5 to about 10,'and especially from about 1 to about 8 mils thick, and are especially suitable for further treatment by 15     stretching or the application of tensile forces in order to promote the beta conformation necessary to achieve ferroelectric properties in polyvinylidene<br>
fluoride.<br>
There are three classes of organic liquids, that<br>
20     may be used to make solutions or dispersions of<br>
vinylidene fluoride polymers. Active solvents are those organic liquids that dissolve or swell vinylidene fluoride polymers at room temperature and typically consist of lower alkyl ketones, esters and<br>
25     amides.  Latent solvents are those organic liquids that do not dissolve vinylidene fluoride homo- or copolymers at room temperature; however, will dissolve polyvinylidene fluoride at elevated temperatures and typically are medium chain length alkyl ketones,<br>
 27 <br><br>
esters, glycol ethers and organic carbonates. Non-solvents are organic liquids that do not dissolve or swell vinylidene fluoride polymers up to the boiling point of the liquid or the crystalline melting point of the vinylidene fluoride polymer, whichever S     condition is met first.  These liquids typically are aromatic hydrocarbons, aliphatic hydro-carbons and chlorinated hydrocarbons or other chlorinated organic liquids.  The solvents and latent solvents are used in the manufacture of the polyvinylidene fluoride films 10     or sheets of the present invention.<br>
Examples of these organic liquids are given in Table A which follows.<br>

OCher meChods have been developed for Che manufacture, when desired, of open cell foam porous polyvinylidene fluoride polymers which are formulated to contain chemical or physical blowing agencs such as absorbed carbon dioxide. It is preferred to use physical blowing agents in the manufacture of electrochemical cells since crace amounts of the chemical blowing agents in the foam structure could adversely affect the funccioning of Che cell.  Where carbon dioxide or comparable physical blowing agents are employed, they are incorporated into the polyvinylidene fluoride at super critical pressures<br>

followed by heat treatment to expand the article thus produced.  Open cell films of varying thickness have been  made in this manner with excellent mechanical integrity and which have specific gravities about one as compared to solid polyvinylidene fluoride which has      a specific gravity of from about 1.76 about 1.78.<br>
Similarly, polyvinylidene fluoride powders can be sintered to form a porous structure by heating the powders in a non-solvent slurry, or under pressure between opposed platens, until the individual      particles sufficiently melt flow into one another to<br>
form the desired open cell structure.  Other art known methods for sintering powder polymers such as PTFE for forming open cell porous structures as described by Menassen et al. "A Polymer Chemist's  View on  Fuel  Call     Electrodes, "  Proceeding of the 34th International<br>
Power Source Symposium, June 25-28, 1990, pp. 408-10 can also be used.<br>
A porous film made by casting polyvinylidene provide polymers of the present invention from a 20     mixture of solvents and non-solvents as described by Benzinger et al. in U.S. Patent 4,333,047, which is about 10 mils thick after formation from the casting solution, may be utilized for the manufacture of an electrochemical cell. The polymer comprises a 25     copolymer of Example 1 herein below.  This film is used in fabricating an absorber-separator of solid<br>
electrolyte by making a solution of LiPE6 of solid<br>
mixture by weight of ethylene carbonate:propylene carbonate which is heated to about 125oc and the <br>
- 30 -<br><br>
porous copolymer film immersed in the solution until<br>
it is combined with the film.<br>
Similarly, a positive electrode is made from the same porous copolymer.  A dispersion of LiMn204, SS carbon black and LiPF6 in a 1:1 mixture of ethylene carbonate and propylene carbonate along with tetrahydrofuran (THF)   was combined with the porous film by soaking the film in the suspension which is agitated in a vibrating beaker in order to keep solid material in suspension until adequately combined with the film.  The film is then placed on an aluminum foil.<br>
A negative electrode is prepared by making a dispersion or suspension of petroleum coke, SS carbon black and LiPF6 in a l:1 ethylene carbonate propylene carbonate solution in the same manner as was done for the preparation of the positive electrode and after combining the suspension with the porous film, a copper foil was placed on the film.<br>
The proportions of the various components of the electrode and the absorber separator or solid electrolyte are substantially the same as those set forth in Examples 1 and 8 of Gozdz et al., U.S. Patent<br>
NO. 5,296,318.<br>
The electrodes and electrolyte can also be made from sintered polyvinylidene fluoride by forming a dry blend of the electrode or electrolyte materials with powdered polyvinylidene fluoride.  Dry mixing techniques, known in the art may be employed, such as tumbler type mixing. For example, the mixture of<br>
- 31 -<br><br>
polyvinylidene fluoride powder and the electrode or electrolyte materials can be subjected to tumbling or ball milling for a time to sufficiently ensure that a good mixture is obtained.  A steel or other metal vessel, or ceramic vessel is employed, especially 5     where either is lined with a polyvinylidene fluoride or PTFE layer.  In the case of ball milling, steel or other metal, or ceramic grinding balls, also coated with a polyvinylidene fluoride or PTFE layer are used. The polyvinylidene fluoride or PTFE coating is<br>
10     employed to substantially minimize or substantially eliminate the introduction of impurities into the system.  The milled mixtures are formed into electrodes and electrolytes by the application of heat and pressure as noted herein.<br>
15	One of skill in the art will recognize that non-<br>
porous VDF/HFP copolymer of the 1st composition aspect of the invention or other vinylidene fluoride polymers of the invention, porous or non-porous may be substituted for the described VDF/HFP of Example 1 to<br>
20     make analogous batteries.<br>
Solvents such as ethylene carbonate and propylene carbonate, and their equivalents, especially as noted herein, including mixtures thereof, which are employed in the electrode or electrolyte can be added<br>
25     afterwards by soaking the electrodes and electrolyte structures in such solvents.  The soaking can be carried out at room temperature or above to maximize the solvating effect of these materials and to produce optimum ionic conductivity n the electrodes or<br>
30     electrolyte.<br>

The positive electrode and the negative electrode thus prepared, are then placed on opposite sides of the absorber-separator prepared as described above with the copper and aluminum surfaces facing outwardly to form a cell as illustrated in Fig. 4 in which      copper film 14 is shown as extending along one surface of negative electrode 16 which is operatively associated with absorber-separator 18 combined with the electrolyte.  aluminum film 22 is in contact with positive electrode 20 which is in turn in contact with<br>
     the other face of absorber-separator 18, all of the elements being operatively associated with one another.  An envelope 12 of polyvinylidene fluoride homopolymer extends completely around the cell. Envelope 12 may be a single film or a plurality of<br>
     films e.g., two or three films and extends around all sides and completely envelops cell 10.  Copper and aluminum leads (not shown) are passed through envelope 10 to make electrical contact with films 14 and 22, respectively and are connected to a load (not shown)<br>
20     to form an electric circuit.<br>
The other electrolytes described herein for the rocking-chair cells may also be employed in lieu of the LiPF6 salt and LiNiO2 or LiCoO2 materials substituted for the LiMn2O4 materials in the forgoing<br>
25     example. Additionally, graphite rather than petroleum coke may be employed in the manufacture of the negative electrode although, petroleum coke is especially preferred.<br>

The vinylidene fluoride polymers of the present invention are also suitable for use in a silver-zinc cell where the vinylidene fluoride polymers are used<br>
15     as a binder for the zinc electrode or in a lead-acid cell as a spacer between the electrodes and as a separator.  The vinylidene fluoride polymers may also be used in thermal batteries for cathode active materials.  In addition to nickel-metal hydride cells,<br>

other alkaline cells such as nickel-cadmium cells, and zinc-air cells. especially where a buttered electrolyte is employed to counteract the dehydrohalogenation effect of the alkali medium of<br>

20     and 0,004 kg of paraffin wax.  The mixture was purged with nitrogen and agitated for 30 minutes.  The reactor was sealed and heated to 80 degrees Celsius. The reactor was charged with 0.400 kg of vinylidene fluoride, 0.030 kg of hexafluoropropylene (a ratio of<br>
25     93 vinylidene fluoride/7 hexafluoropropylene). and 0.120 kg of a 5 wt.% solution of ethyl acetate in deionized water.  The reaction conditions were stabilized at 80 degrees Celsius and 4480 kPa, and then the polymerization was begun by introducing 0.026<br>

propyl peroxydicarbonate and 0.15 wt% mixed perfluoroalkanoate salts dispersed in deionized water. The polymerization was maintained by the addition of the initiator emulsion at the rate of 0.112 kg per hour, and by the addition of a mixture of vinylidene      fluoride/hexafluoropropylene in the ratio 93<br>
vinvlidene fluoride/7 hexafluoropropylene so as to maintain pressure.  After 3.1 hours, totals of 1.890 kg of vinylidene fluoride and 0.140 kg of hexafluoropropylene had been charged to the reactor.<br>
10     Monomer feeds were stopped, and residual monomer was consumed by maintaining the initiator emulsion feed and 80 degrees Celsius for 20 minutes.  The initiator feed and agitation were stopped, and the reactor was allowed to settle for 10 minutes.  The reactor was<br>
     cooled to 45 degrees Celsius, vented, and then it was emptied of latex.  Polymer resin was isolated by coagulating the latex, washing the resulting solids with boiling water, and drying the solids at 110 degrees Celsius to yield fine powder.  The resin so<br>
     made had a melt viscosity of 2550 Pa.s, had a DSC melting point of 154 degrees Celsius, and had a hexafluoropropylene content as measured by NMR of 6.0 wt. %.<br>

charged 200.0 kg of deionized water, 1.00 kg of a 10 wt% solution of a mixture of perfluoroalkanoate salts, and 0.015 kg of paraffin oil.  The reactor was evacuated and heated to a temperature of 91 degrees<br>
30     Celsius during the charging, and agitation was used.<br>
- 39 -<br><br>
To the reactor were added 12.6 kg of vinylidene fluoride, 0.8 kg of hexafluoropropylene (a ratio of 94 vinvlidene fluoride/6 hexafluoropropylene), and 0.5 kg of ethyl acetate, which brought the reactor pressure to 4480 kPa. During the pressurization, when the pressure reached 3445 kPa, a feed of initiator emulsion consisting of 2 wt% di-n-propyl peroxydicarbonate and 0,15 wt% mixed<br>

pertiuoroalkanoate salts dispersed in deionized water was begun and was maintained at 9.0 kg/h until 4.6 kg of initiator emulsion had been added.  The rate of further initiator emulsion addition was adjusted so as to maintain a total monomer feed rate of 27.0 kg/h.  A monomer mixture in the ratio 94 vinvlidene fluoride/6 hexafluoropropylene was fed to the reactor so as to" 15     maintain pressure at 4480 kPa until the totals of 85.3 kg of vinylidene fluoride and 5.4 kg of hexafluoropropylene had been charged to the reactor. All feeds were stopped, and residual monomer was consumed by maintaining 91° Celsius and agitation for 20     20 minutes and then by maintaining 91° C for 35<br>
minutes.  The reactor was cooled, vented, and emptied of latex.  Polymer resin was isolated by coagulating the latex, washing the resulting solids with water, and drying the solids to yield fine powder.  The resin 25     so made had a melt viscosity of 1740 Pa.s, had a DSC melting point of 155 degrees Celsius, and had a hexafluoropropylene content as measured by NMR of 4.7<br>

The term "solution (s) havincr improved clarity and fluidity" as used in the specification and claims of this application means that the solution(s) of any particular copolymer of this invention having a particular nominal HFP content will provide solution(s) having descriptive properties analogous to those shown by Example 2 in Table II when dissolved in any of the solvents listed at the same concentration levels at which a copolymer having about the same particular nominal HFP content made by a typical process described in detail in the prior art provides solution descriptive properties analogous to those shown in<br>
Table II for Example 12. EVALUATION OP THE SOLUTION PROPERTIES OP THE<br>
EXAMPLSS<br>
The solution properties of examples 2 and 12 are shown in Table IX.  Mixtures of the indicated weight percent were prepared, using heat when necessary to dissolve the polymer completely and form a clear solution.  Solutions were then allowed to cool and observed daily over a period of two weeks.  The copolymer 2 showed a reduced tendency to gel and to be clearer than the copolymer 12.  The retention of fluidity and clarity by the copolymer 2 is advantageous in applications which rely on polymer solutions, such as in the production of cast films and membranes.<br>
The reduction in tendency toward gelation by the copolymers of the present invention is further<br>
- 43 -<br><br>
shown in Table II A.  The gelation times of propylene carbonate solutions of some of the examples are shown in the table.  A Rheometrics® dynamic stress rheometer DSR-200 was used to measure the gelation times of 20 wt% solutions of the polymers in propylene carbonate (the propylene carbonate was of nominal 99.7% purity).  The rheometer was fitted with a Peltier fixture and solvent trap.  A 40 mm parallel plate geometry was used with a gap of 1 mm.  Solid copolymer was mixed with propylene carbonate at room temperature on the day of measurement, the container was sealed, and the solution was formed by heating and stirring the mixture in the sealed container for 1.0 hour in a Pierce Reacti-Therm® Heating/Stirring Module set at 120°C.  The solutions were quickly loaded at the end of the dissolution period into the test fixture, which was preset at 100°C.  A temperature cooling ramp in dynamic oscillatory mode at l Hz was begun as soon as the fixture temperature re-equilibrated at 100°C; re-equilibration typically required a minute or less. The cooling ramp was from X00°C to 15°C at a rate of 30°C/m.  When 15°C was reached, a 1 minute equilibration, time was used, and then a time sweep measurement was begun.  The sample was held at 15°C during the time sweep measurement performed at 1 radian/s.  The time sweep was continued until the gel point was reached. The gel point was taken as the point at which the solution storage modulus, G', and the loss modulus, G", became equal.  The gel<br>
-   44 -<br><br>
time was taken as the time duration in the time sweep to reach the gel point,<br>
The relation between HFP content and the logarithm of the gel time of the 20 wt% propylene carbonate solutions is shown in Figure 3,  It can be seen that the copolymers prepared according to the present invention have longer gelation times than the copolymers prepared according to the prior art synthesis over the whole range of HFP content.  The reduced tendency toward gelation by the copolymers of the present invention is advantageous in processing such solutions for film casting and other solution applications.<br>

EVALUATION OF FILM GLOSS AND CLARITY<br>
Some of the non-gelled solutions from the solution property tests were used to make films which were tested for gloss and clarity.  The films were cast on a Leneta Form 2A opacity chart using a 0.127 meter draw down applicator having a 250 micrometer gap.  The cast films were dried for three days at room temperature.  Film gloss was determined using a HunterLab Progloss PG-2 gloss meter, and the results are shown in Table III.  Film haze was measured by determining the whiteness index (CIELAB L* value) of the film on the black, portion of the opacity chart using a HunterLab Labscan 2 colorimeter, and the results are shown in Table IV.<br>
- 47 -<br><br>
Films from copolymer 2 showed higher gloss from a wider range of solvents than films from copolymer 12.  The haze in films from 2 and 12 was generally similar, but noticeably less haze was observed in films from 2 in several instances.  The results, taken together, show that VDF/HFP copolymer of the present invention demonstrates an increased utility for high-gloss, high-transparency film applications.<br>

EVALUATION OF THE THERMAL PROPERTIES OF THE EXAMPLES<br>
The final melting point is an important parameter in the use and processing of semicrystalline polymers.  It is known that the final melting point of VDF/HFP copolymers is related to the HFP content in the copolymers.  The relation between HFP content and final melting point of the VDF/HFP copolymer examples is shown in Figure 1. The copolymers of the present invention and the copolymers prepared according to the prior art synthesis which details are available can be seen to fall on different melting point curves, indicating that they are different materials, with the prior art copolymers having a higher melting point at a given HFP content.  The lower melting point property of the copolymers of the present invention can allow lower processing temperatures than for the prior art<br>
synthesis copolymers.<br>
