The present invention related to compounds of general formula I, to pharmaceutical composition containing them and their use in the treatment of neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders.<br>
It has surprisingly been found that the compounds of general formula I are good inhibitors of the glycine transporter 1 (GlyT-1), and that they have a good selectivity to glycine transporter 2 (GlyT-2) inhibitors.<br>
Schizophrenia is a progressive and devastating neurological disease characterized by episodic positive symptoms such as delusions, hallucinations, thought disorders and psychosis and persistent negative symptoms such as flattened affect, impaired attention and social withdrawal, and cognitive impairments (Lews DA and Lieberman JA, Neuroi% 2000, 28:325-33). For decades research has focused on the "dopaminergic hyperactivity" hypothesis which has led to therapeutic interventions involving blockade of the dopaminergic system (Vandenberg RJ and Aubrey KR., Exp. Opin. Tner. Targets, 2001,<br><br>
5(4): 507-518; Nakazato A and Oknyama 2 et al., 2000, Ety. Opvru Ther. Patents, 10(1): 75-98). This pharmacological approach poorly address negative and cognitive symptoms which, are the best predictors of functional outcome (Shaxma T., Br J. Psychiatry* 1999, 174(suppl. 28): 44-51).<br>
A complementary model of schizophrenia was proposed in the mid-19605 based upon the psychotomimetic action caused by the blockade of the glutamate system by compounds like phencydidine (PCP) and related agents (ketamine) which are noncompetitive NMDA receptor antagonists. Interestingly in healthy volunteers, PCP-induced psychotomimetic action incorporates positive and negative symptoms as well as cognitive dysfunction, thus closely resembling schizophrenia in patients (Javitt DC et al., 1999, Biol Psychiatry, 45: 668-679 and refs. herein). Furthermore transgenic mice expressing reduced levels of the NMDAR1 subunit displays behavioral abnormalities similar to those observed in pharmacologically induced models of schizophrenia, supporting a model in which reduced NMDA receptor activity results in schizophrenialike behavior (Mohn AR et al., 1999, CeK, 98:427-236).<br>
Glutamate neurotransmission, in particular NMDA receptor activity, plays a critical role in synaptic plasticity, learning and memory, such as the NMDA receptors appears to serve as a graded switch for gating the threshold of synaptic plasticity and memory formation (Hebb DO, 1949, The organization of behavior, Wiley, NY; Bliss TV and Collingridge GL, 1993, Nature, 361: 31-39). Transgenic mice overexpressing the NMDA KR2B subunit exhibit enhanced synaptic plasticity and superior ability in learning and memory (Tang JP et al., 1999, Nature. 401- 63-69).<br>
Thus, if a gLutamate deficit is implicate in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia, enhancing glutamate transmission, in particular via NMDA receptor activation, would be predicted to produce both anti-psychotic and cognitive enhancing effects.<br>
The amino acid glycine is known to have at least two important functions in the CNS. It acts as an inhibitory amino acid, binding to strychnine sensitive glycine receptors, and it also influences excitatory activity, acting as an essential co-agonist with glutamate for N-mefhyl-D- aspartate (NMDA) receptor function. While glutamate is released in an activity-dependent manner from synaptic terminals, glycine is apparently present at a more constant level and seems, to modulate/control the receptor for its response to glutamate.<br>
One of the most effective ways to control synaptic concentrations of neurotransmitter is to influence their re-uptake at the synapses. Neurotransmitter<br><br>
transporters by removing neurotransmitters from the extracellular space, can control their extracellular lifetime and thereby modulate the magnitude of the synaptic transmission (Gainetdinov RR et al, 20023 Trends in Pharm. Sri., 23(8): 367-373).<br>
Glycine transporters, which form part of the sodium and chloride family of neurotransmitter transporters, play an important role in the termination of post-synaptic glycinergic actions and maintenance of low extracellular glycine concentration byre-uptake of glycine into presynaptic nerve terminals and surrounding fine glial processes.<br>
Two distinct glycine transporter genes have been cloned (GlyT-1 and GlyT-2) from mammalian brain, which give rise to two transporters with ~50 % amino acid sequence homology. GlyT-1 presents four isoforms arising from alternative splicing and alternative promoter usage (la, lb, 1c and Id). Only two of these isoforms have been found in rodent brain (GlyT-la and GlyT-lb). GlyT-2 also presents some degree of heterogeneity. Two GlyT-2 isoforms (2a and 2b) have been identified in rodent brains. GlyT-1 is known to be located in CNS and in peripheral tissues, whereas GlyT-2 is specific to the CNS. GlyT-1 has a predominantly glial distribution and is found not only in areas corresponding to strychnine sensitive glycine receptors but also outside these areas, where it has been postulated to be involved in modulation of NMDA receptor function (Lopez-Corcuera B et aL, 2001, Mol Mem. Biol, 18:13-20). Thus, one strategy to enhance NMDA receptor activity is to elevate the glycine concentration in the local microenvironment of synaptic NMDA receptors by inhibition of GlyT-1 transporter (Bergereon R. Et aL, 1998, Proc Natl Acad. Set. USA, 95:15730-15734; Chen L et aL, 2003, J. Neurophysiol, 89 (2): 691-703).<br>
Glycine transporters inhibitors are suitable for the treatment of neuroligical and neuropsychiatric disorders.The majority of diseases states implicated are psychoses, schizophrenia (Armer RE and Miller DJ, 2O01, Exp. Opin. Ther. Patents, 11 (4): 563-572), psychotic mood disorders such as severe major depressive disorder, mood disorders associated with psychotic disorders such as acute mania or depression associated with bipolar disorders and mood disorders associated with schizophrenia, (Pralong ET et aL, 2002, Prog. NeurobioU 67:173-202), autistic disorders (Carlsson ML, 1998, J. Neural Transm. 105: 525-535), cognitive disorders such as dementias, including age related dementia and senile dementia of the Alzheimer type, memory disorders in a mammal, including a human, attention deficit disorders and pain (Armer RE and Miller DJ, 2001, By. Opin. Ther. Patents, 11 (4): 563-572).<br><br>
Thus, increasing activation of NMD A receptors via GlyT-i inhibition may lead to agents that treat psychosis, schizophrenia, dementia and other diseases in which cognitive processes are impaired, such as attention deficit disorders or Alzheimer's disease.<br>

wherein the substituents are as defined above, or b)  reacting a compound of formula<br><br><br>
wherein the substituents are as defined above, or<br>
c) if desired, separating the obtained racemic forms into corresponding enantiomers, and<br>
if desired, converting the compounds obtained into pharmaceutical^ acceptable add addition salts.<br>
The compounds of formula I maybe prepared in accordance with process variant a), b) or c) and with the following schemes 1, 2 and 3.<br>
The following abbreviations have been used:<br>
LDA = lithium diisopropylamide TFA = trifluoroacetic acid DCM = dichloromethane THF = tetrahydrofuran P2\4HS = polymethylhydxosiloxane DMSO = dimethylsulfoxide<br>
Starting from an appropriately l-protected-piperidine-4-alk57'lcarborylate 2, treatment with an appropriate base, usually LDA, followed by treatment with an appropriately substituted nitro alkene 3 results in formation of the nitro alkane 4 Reduction to the amino group facilitated by Raney-Ni and hydrogen, usually at 60 bar<br><br>
pressure and at 55 °C in EtOH as solvent results in the formation of 5. Subsequent cyclisation by heating in toluene under reflux affords the amide 6. Removal of the protecting group under standard conditions (TFA treatment in DCM for R = Boc; or hydrogenolysis with Pd/C in DCM3 MeOH for R = Bn) affords the diazaspiropiperidines 7 (Scheme 1).<br><br>
Further reaction of compounds of formula 7 with corresponding compounds of formula 11 (which can be prepared by reaction of the arylhalides of formula 8 with BuLi and subsequent reaction with an epoxide of formula 9 to give the alcohols of formula 10, which are oxidized to the corresponding ketones of formula 11 with Dess-Martin Periodinane) in the presence of Ti(OPr-i)4 and NaBH(OAc)3 to give compounds of formula I (Scheme 2). Alternatively, reaction of compounds of formulas 7 and 11 in the presence of Ti(OPr-i)4 and NaBH(OAc)3 (with or without the presence of PMHS) also gives products of formula!. An alternative strategy where overall reductive amination of the ketones of formula 11 with compounds of formula 12 in a Dean-Stark trap affords an intermediate enamine, wThich can be reduced in situ to the compound formula 13. Following steps 1-3 as described in Scheme 1 affords compounds of formula L<br><br><br>
Compounds of formula I for X = OH are prepared by reacting compounds of formula 7<br>
-with an oxides of formula 9 in refluxing ethanol. The resulting ft—arninoalcohol of formula 14 can then be oxidised to the ketone, preferably, with pyridine.S03 complex in the presence of triethylamine in DMSO to give compounds of formula 15, which are then treated with aryl lithium reagents (formed by halogen-metal exchange) to provide access to the desired products of formula I (Scheme 3).<br><br><br>
All compounds of formulas I, 4, 5,6,7,11,10,13,14,15 are usually formed during the sequence of reactions into an equal mixture of (R,R,S)-&gt; (S,S,R)-, (R&gt;R,R)- and (S&gt;S,S)-enantiomers (racemic forms), following the procedures described below. They may separated into chiral non-racemic enantiomers by preparative HPLC using either a Chiralpak OD or AD column (5 x 50 cm) at room temperature using an ethanol: heptane mobile phase with UV detection at 220 nM.<br>
The acid addition salts of the basic compounds of formula I may be converted to the corresponding free bases by treatment with at least a stoichiometric equivalent of a suitable base such as sodium or potassium hydroxide, potassium carbonate, sodiiam bicarbonate, ammonia, and the like.<br>
The compounds of formula I and their pharmaceutical^ usable addition salts possess valuable pharmacological properties. Specifically, it has been found that the compounds of the present invention are good inhibitors of the glycine transporter I (GlyT-1).<br>
The compounds were investigated in accordance with the test given hereinafter.<br>
Solutions and materials<br>
DMEM complete medium: Nutrient mixture F-12 (Gibco Life-technologies),-fetal bovine serum (FBS) 5 %, (Gibco life technologies). Penicillin/Streptomycin! % (Gibco life technologies), Hygromycin 0.6 mg/ml (Gibco life technologies), Glutamine 1 rnlsl Gibco life technologies)<br><br><br>
Glycine uptake inhibition assay frnGlyT-lb)<br>
On day 1 mammalian cells, (Hp~in™-CHO), transfected with mGlyT-lb cDNA &gt; were plated at the density of 40,000 cells/well in complete F-12 medium, without hygromycm in 96-well culture plates. On day 2, the medium was aspirated and the cells were washed twice with uptake buffer (UB). The cells were then incubated for 20 min at 22°C with either (i) no potential competitor, (ii) 10 mM non-radioactive glycine, (iii) a concentration of a potential inhibitor. A range of concentrations of the potential inhibitor was used to generate data for calculating the concentration of inhibitor resulting in 50 % of the effect (e.g. IC50, the concentration of the competitor inhibiting glycine uptake of 50 %). A solution was then immediately added containing [~H]-glycine<br>
60 nM (11-16 Ci/mmol)  and 25 pM non-radioactive glycine. The plates were incubated with gentle shaking and the reaction was stopped by aspiration of the mixture and washing (three times) with ice-cold UB. The cells were lysed with scintillation liquid, shaken 3 hours and the radioactivity in the cells was counted using a scintillation counter.<br>
The activity as inhibitor of the glycine transporter I (GlyT-1) is dependent on its racemic or enantiomeric form.<br><br><br><br>
The compounds of formula I and the pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compounds of formula I can be used as medicaments, e.g. in the form of pharmaceutical preparations. The pharmaceutical preparations can be administered orally, e.g. in the form of tablets, coated tablets, drag6es&gt; hard and soft gelatine capsules, solutions, emulsions or suspensions. The administration can, however, also be effected rectally, e.g. in the form of suppositories, parenterally, e.g. in the form of injection solutions.<br>
The compounds of formula I can be processed with pharmaceutically inert, inorganic or organic carriers for the production of pharmaceutical preparations. Lactose,corn starch or derivatives thereof, talc, stearic adds or its salts and the like can be used, for example, as such carriers for tablets, coated tablets, dragdes and hard gelatine capsules. Suitable carriers for soft gelatine capsules are, for example, vegetable oils, waxes, fats, semi-solid and liquid polyols and the like. Depending on the nature of the active substance no carriers are however usually required in the case of soft gelatine capsules. Suitable carriers for the production of solutions and syrups are, for example, water, polyols, glycerol, vegetable oil and the like. Suitable carriers for suppositories are, for example, natural or hardened oils, waxes, fats, semi-liquid or liquid polyols and the like.<br>
The pharmaceutical preparations can, moreover, contain preservatives, solubilizers, stabilizers, wetting agents, emulsifiers, sweeteners, colorants, flavorants, salts for varjing the osmotic pressure, buffers, masking agents or antioxidants. They can also contain still other therapeutically valuable substances.<br>
Medicaments containing a compound of formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof and a therapeutically inert carrier are also an object of the present invention, as is a process for their production, which comprises bringing one or more compounds of formula I and/or pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts and., if desired, one or more other therapeutically valuable substances into a galenical administration form together with one or more therapeutically inert carriers.<br><br>
The most preferred indications in accordance with the present invention axe those, which include disorders of the central nervous system, for example the treatment or prevention of schizophrenia, cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease.<br>
The dosage can vary -within wide limits and will, of course, have to be adjusted to the individual requirements in each particular case. In the case of oral administration the dosage for adults can vary from about 0.01 mg to about 1000 mg per day of a compound of general formula I or of the corresponding amount of a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. The daily dosage maybe administered as single dose or in divided doses and, in addition, the upper limit can also be exceeded when this is found to be indicated.<br>

After 5 min at this temperature, qrclohexenoxide (11.0 mL, 109 mmol) was added followed by the addition ofborontrifluoride-diethyletherate (13.8 mL, 109 mmol) whereby the temperature increased to approx. -50 °C. After 4 h at this temperature the reaction was quenched by the addition of ammonium chloride (saturated, 200 mL) and diluted with water (50 mL). The product was then extracted with diethylether (3 x 100 mL) and the combined organic extracts dried over sodium sulfate. Filtration and evaporation afforded the title compound (11.9 g, 56 %) as white crystals after trituration from hexane. MS : m/e =194.1 (M).<br>
rac-2-f4-Huoro-phenylVcvrlohexanone<br>

The organic phase w^as then separated and washed with sodium thiosulfite (10 %, 150 mL) and then dried over sodium sulfate, filtered and evaporated. Purification by<br><br>
chromatography through silica gel, eluting with ethyl acetate: hexane (1:4) afforded the title compound (3.4 g, 89 %) as white crystals. MS : m/e = 192.1 (M).<br>
rac-2-(4-Fluoro-pheirri)-cvclohexanone<br>
bii) Alternatively to a solution of rac-2-(4-fluoro-phenyl)~cyclohexanol (7.5 g, 39 nmol) in dry DMSO (67 mL) was added triethyiamine (27 mL, 190 mmol) under argon ind the resulting mixture cooled to 0 °C and then a solution of sulfur trioxide pyridine complex (18.4 g, 116 mmol) in dry DMSO (98 mL) was added dropwise over 15 min. After 1 h, the mixture was diluted with water (200 mL) and the product extracted with DCM (2 x 100 mL). The combined organic extracts were then dried over sodium sulfate, followed by filtration and evaporation. Purification by filtration through silica gel, eluting with ethyl acetate: hexane (1: 4) afforded the title compound (7.1 g, 95 %) as white crystals. MS: m/e = 192.1 (M).<br>
rac-2-p-Tolyl-cyclohexanone<br>
rac-2-ft-Tolvl-cyclohexanol<br>
