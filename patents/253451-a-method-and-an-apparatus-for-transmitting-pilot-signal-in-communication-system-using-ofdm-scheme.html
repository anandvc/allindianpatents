APPARATUS AND METHOD FOR TRANSMITTING/RECEIVING<br>
PILOT SIGNAL IN COMMUNICATION SYSTEM USING OFDM<br>
SCHEME<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a communication system using an<br>
Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) scheme, and more<br>
particularly to an apparatus and a method for transmitting/receiving pilot signals<br>
for identifying base stations and sectors.<br>
2.	Description of the Related Art<br>
In a 4 generation (4G) communication system, which is the next<br>
generation communication system, research is currently being conducted to<br>
provide users with services having various qualities of service ('QoS') and that<br>
support a high transmission speed. Currently, in the 4G communication system,<br>
research is currently being conducted to support high speed services while<br>
ensuring mobility and QoS in a wireless local area network ('LAN') and a<br>
metropolitan area network ('MAN') system.<br>
As a scheme useful for high speed data transmission in wire or wireless<br>
channels, the OFDM scheme is now actively being developed. The OFDM<br>
scheme, which transmits data using multiple carriers, is a special type of a<br>
Multiple Carrier Modulation (MCM) scheme in which a serial symbol sequence is<br>
converted into parallel symbol sequences and the parallel symbol sequences are<br>
modulated with a plurality of mutually orthogonal sub-carriers before being<br>
transmitted.<br>
In order to provide a wireless multimedia service at high speed and high<br>
quality, the 4G communication system requires a wideband spectrum resource.<br>
However, when the wideband spectrum resource is used, not only the influence of<br>
fading on the wireless transmission paths due to multi-path propagation becomes<br>
severe, but also the frequency selective fading has an influence on the<br>
transmission frequency bands. Therefore, for high speed wireless multimedia<br>
services, the OFDM scheme is now more frequently used than the Code Division<br>
Multiple Access (CDMA) scheme in the 4G communication system, since the<br>
OFDM scheme is more robust against the frequency selective fading and is thus<br>
more advantageous than the CDMA scheme.<br>
Operations of a transmitter and a receiver in a communication system<br>
using the OFDM scheme (OFDM communication system) will be briefly<br><br>
discussed. The transmitter may be a base station (BS) and the receiver may be a<br>
subscriber station (SS).<br>
In the transmitter of the OFDM communication system, input data is<br>
modulated into sub-carrier signals by a scrambler, an encoder and an interleaver.<br>
The transmitter provides a variety of variable data rates, which determines the<br>
coding rate, the interleaving size and the modulation scheme. Usually, the encoder<br>
uses coding rates such as 1/2, 3/4, etc., and the interleaving size for preventing<br>
burst error is determined according to the Number of Coded Bits Per OFDM<br>
Symbol (NCBPS). As the modulation scheme, a QPSK (Quadrature Phase Shift<br>
Keying) scheme, an 8PSK (Phase Shift Keying) scheme, a 16QAM (Quadrature<br>
Amplitude Modulation) scheme, or a 64QAM (Quadrature Amplitude<br>
Modulation) scheme may be used according to the data rates.<br>
A predetermined number of the modulated sub-carrier signals are added<br>
to a predetermined number of pilot sub-carrier signals, and an Inverse Fast<br>
Fourier Transform (IFFT) unit performs IFFT for the added signals, thereby<br>
generating an OFDM symbol. Guard intervals are then inserted into the OFDM<br>
symbol in order to eliminate the inter-symbol interference (ISI) in the multi-path<br>
channel environment, and the OFDM symbol containing the guard intervals is<br>
finally input to a Radio Frequency (RF) processor through a symbol waveform<br>
generator. The RF processor processes the input signal and transmits the<br>
processed signal over the air.<br>
The receiver of the OFDM communication system corresponding to the<br>
transmitter as described above performs a reverse process to the process in the<br>
transmitter together with an additional synchronization step. First, frequency<br>
offset estimation and symbol offset estimation are performed in advance using a<br>
training symbol set for a received OFDM symbol. Then, a data symbol obtained<br>
by eliminating the guard intervals from the OFDM symbol is restored to a<br>
predetermined number of the sub-carrier signals containing a predetermined<br>
number of pilot sub-carriers added thereto by a Fast Fourier Transform (FTT) unit.<br>
Further, in order to overcome any path delay in an actual wireless channel, an<br>
equalizer estimates the channel condition for the received channel signal, thereby<br>
eliminating the signal distortion in the actual wireless channel from the received<br>
channel signal. The data channel-estimated by the equalizer is transformed into a<br>
bit stream which then passes through a de-interleaver. Thereafter, the bit stream<br>
passes through a decoder and a descrambler for error correction and is then output<br>
as final data.<br>
In the OFDM communication system as described above, a transmitter<br>
(for example, a BS) transmits the pilot sub-carrier signals to a receiver (for<br>
example, an SS). The BS simultaneously transmits the data sub-carrier signals<br><br>
together with the pilot sub-carrier signals. The SS can perform synchronization<br>
acquisition, channel estimation and BS identification by receiving the pilot sub-<br>
carrier signals. That is, the pilot sub-carrier signal is a reference sub-carrier signal<br>
and serves as a training sequence, thereby enabling channel estimation between<br>
the transmitter and the receiver. Moreover, an SS can identify, by using the pilot<br>
sub-carrier signal, a BS to which the SS belongs. The locations for the pilot sub-<br>
carrier signals, are defined in advance by a protocol between the transmitter and<br>
the receiver. As a result, the pilot sub-carrier signals operate as reference signals.<br>
A process in which an SS identifies by using the pilot sub-carrier signals,<br>
a BS to which the SS belongs will be described.<br>
First, the BS transmits the pilot sub-carrier signals at a transmit power<br>
level greater than that for the data sub-carrier signals such that the pilot sub-<br>
carrier signals can reach the cell boundary with a particular pattern (specifically,<br>
pilot pattern). The reason why the BS transmits the pilot sub-carrier signals with a<br>
high transmit power such that the pilot sub-carrier signals can reach the cell<br>
boundary with a particular pilot pattern will be described.<br>
First, the SS does not have any specific information identifying the BS to<br>
which the SS currently belongs when the SS enters a cell. In order to detect the<br>
BS to which the SS belongs, the SS must receive the pilot sub-carrier signals.<br>
Therefore, the BS transmits the pilot sub-carrier signals having a particular pilot<br>
pattern with a relatively high transmit power, in order to enable the SS to detect<br>
the BS to which the SS belongs as far away as at the cell edge.<br>
The pilot pattern is a pattern generated by the pilot sub-carrier signals<br>
transmitted by the BS. That is, the pilot pattern is generated by the slope of the<br>
pilot sub-carrier signals and the start point at which the pilot sub-carrier signals<br>
begin to be transmitted. Therefore, the OFDM communication system must be<br>
designed such that each BS in the OFDM communication system has a specific<br>
pilot pattern for its identification. Further, a coherence bandwidth and a coherence<br>
time must be taken into account when generating the pilot pattern.<br>
The coherence bandwidth is a maximum bandwidth based on an<br>
assumption that a channel is constant in a frequency domain. The coherence time<br>
is a maximum time based on an assumption that a channel is constant in a time<br>
domain. Therefore, it can be assumed that the channel is constant within the<br>
coherence bandwidth and the coherence time. As a result, the transmission of a<br>
single pilot sub-carrier signal within the coherence bandwidth and during the<br>
coherence time is sufficient for synchronization acquisition, channel estimation<br>
and BS identification, and can maximize the transmission of the data sub-carrier<br>
signals, thereby improving the performance of the entire system. It can be said<br>
that the coherence bandwidth is a maximum frequency interval within which the<br><br>
pilot sub-carrier signals are transmitted, and the coherence time is a maximum<br>
time interval within which the pilot channel signals are transmitted, that is, a<br>
maximum OFDM symbol time interval.<br>
The number of the pilot patterns having different slopes and different start<br>
points must be equal to or greater than the number of BSs included in the OFDM<br>
communication system. In order to transmit the pilot sub-carrier signals in the<br>
time-frequency domain of the OFDM communication system, the coherence<br>
bandwidth and the coherence time must be taken into consideration as described<br>
above. When the coherence bandwidth and the coherence time is taken into<br>
consideration, there is a limitation in the number of the pilot patterns having<br>
different slopes and different start points. In contrast, when the pilot pattern is<br>
generated without considering the coherence bandwidth and the coherence time,<br>
pilot sub-carrier signals in pilot patterns representing different BSs get mixed up,<br>
so that it becomes impossible to identify the BSs by using the pilot patterns.<br>
All of the slopes which can be generated by the pilot patterns will be<br>
discussed with reference to FIG. 1.<br>
FIG. 1 is a graph illustrating all of the slopes which can be generated by<br>
the pilot patterns in a typical OFDM communication system.<br>
Referring to FIG. 1, all of the slopes which can be generated by the pilot<br>
patterns and the number of the slopes (that is, the slopes according to the pilot<br>
sub-carrier signal transmission and the number of the slopes) are limited by the<br>
coherence bandwidth 100 and the coherence time 110. In FIG. 1, when the<br>
coherence bandwidth 100 is 6 and the coherence time 110 is 1, if the slope of the<br>
pilot pattern is an integer, six slopes from the slop s=0 (101) to the slop s=5 (106)<br>
can be generated as the slope of the pilot pattern. That is, under the conditions<br>
described above, the slope of the pilot pattern is one integer from among 0 to 5.<br>
The fact that six slopes of the pilot patterns can be generated implies that six BSs<br>
can be identified by using the pilot patterns in the OFDM communication system<br>
satisfying the conditions described above. A hatched circle 107 in FIG. 1<br>
represents another pilot sub-carrier signal spaced with the coherence bandwidth<br>
100 away from the first pilot sub-carrier signal.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
As described above, the number of the pilot patterns used in order to<br>
identify BSs in the OFDM communication system is limited by the coherence<br>
bandwidth and the coherence time. Therefore, the limitation in the number of the<br>
pilot patterns which can be generated results in the limitation in the number of<br>
identifiable BSs in the OFDM communication system.<br><br>
Further, when the pilot sub-carrier signals have the same phase, a Peak to<br>
Average Power Ratio (PAPR) may increase. When the PAPR is too high, the<br>
orthogonality between the pilot sub-carriers transmitted by the transmitter may<br>
collapse. Therefore, it is necessary to minimize the PAPR in designing the pilot<br>
sub-carrier signals.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention has been made to solve at least the<br>
above-mentioned problems occurring in the prior art, and an object of the present<br>
invention is to provide an apparatus and a method for transmitting/receiving pilot<br>
signals for identifying base stations and sectors in an OFDM communication<br>

transmitting reference signals in a communication system which includes a<br>
plurality of cells and has a frequency band divided into N sub-carrier bands, each<br>
of the cells having at least one sector and at least one transmit antenna, the<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
Hereinafter, preferred embodiments of the present invention will be<br>
described with reference to the accompanying drawings. In the following -<br>
description, a detailed description of known functions and configurations<br>
incorporated herein will be omitted when it may make the subject matter of the<br>
present invention rather unclear.<br>
The present invention provides an apparatus and a method for<br>
transmitting/receiving pilot signals for identifying base stations and sectors in an<br>
OFDM communication system. More specifically, the present invention provides<br>
an apparatus and a method for transmitting/receiving pilot signals, which can<br>
minimize the interference between the pilot signals while performing an<br>
identification of the base stations and the sectors.<br>
FIG. 2 is a block diagram illustrating an internal structure of a pilot<br>
generator of an OFDM communication system according to an embodiment of the<br>
present invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 2, the pilot generator includes a Walsh Hadamard<br>
matrix generator 201, a selector 203, a Walsh code repeater 205, interleavers 207-<br>
1, ..., and 207-U, adders 209-1, ..., and 209-U, and a sub-carrier allocator 211.<br>
First, a cell identifier ('ID'), which is an ID for identifying a cell (i.e. a<br>
BS), is input to the selector 203, and the Walsh Hadamard matrix generator 201<br>
generates a Walsh Hadamard matrix, each row of which includes Walsh codes.<br>
Upon receiving the cell ID, the selector 203 selects a row corresponding to the<br>
cell ID in the Walsh Hadamard matrix generated by the Walsh Hadamard matrix<br>
generator 201 and outputs the selected row to the interleavers 207-1, ..., and 207-<br>
U. The selected row of the Walsh Hadamard matrix corresponding to the cell ID<br>
and that is output from the selector 203 may be used either once or multiple times.<br>
The repetition of the selected row of the Walsh Hadamard matrix corresponding<br><br>
to the cell ID is based on the length of the pilot symbol, and the number of times<br>
which the selected row of the Walsh Hadamard matrix corresponding to the cell<br>
ID is repeated corresponds to the length of the pilot symbol. In FIG. 2, it is<br>
assumed that the row of the Walsh Hadamard matrix corresponding to the cell ID<br>
is repeated U times.<br>
The row of the Walsh Hadamard matrix corresponding to the cell ID and<br>
output from the selector 203 is input to the U number of interleavers 207-1, ...,<br>
and 207-U. The interleavers 207-1, ..., and 207-U receive the signal from the<br>
selector 203, interleave the signal according to an interleaving scheme set in<br>
advance, and output the interleaved signal to the adders 209-1, ..., and 209-U,<br>
respectively. Here, the reason why the interleavers 207-1, ..., and 207-U<br>
interleave the signal from the selector 203 according to the predetermined<br>
interleaving scheme is that each row of the Walsh Hadamard matrix includes a<br>
frequently repeated numerical sequence of a specific pattern, which yields a high<br>
PAPR. In other words, the PAPR of the pilot signal of the OFDM system is<br>
reduced by interleaving the elements of the row of the Walsh Hadamard matrix.<br>
A sector ID, an ID for identifying a sector, is input to the Walsh code<br>
repeater 205. Upon receiving the sector ID, the Walsh code repeater 205 repeats a<br>
Walsh code corresponding to the sector ID a predetermined number of times and<br>
then outputs a signal including the repeated Walsh code to the adders 209-1, ...,<br>
and 209-U. In the present embodiment, it is assumed that the pilot symbol of the<br>
OFDM communication system has a length of Np, the Walsh Hadamard matrix<br>
has an NH order, and the Walsh code has a length of Nw. On this assumption, the<br>
Walsh code repeater 205 repeats NH/NW times the Walsh code corresponding to<br>
the sector ID and outputs the signal including the repeated Walsh code to the<br>
adders 209-1, ..., and 209-U. The length of the signal output from the Walsh code<br>
repeater 205 is equal to the length NH of the signal output from the interleavers<br>
207-1, ..., and 207-U. The adders 209-1, ..., and 209-U perform an exclusive.OR<br>
(XOR) operation on the signals output from the interleavers 207-1, ..., and 207-U,<br>
and the signal output from the Walsh code repeater 205, and output the resultant<br>
signals to the sub-carrier allocator 211.<br>
A PAPR reduction sequence is a sequence for reducing the PAPR of a<br>
pilot symbol in the OFDM communication system and has a length of NR. It is<br>
assumed that the PAPR reduction sequence has been determined in advance and<br>
corresponds to the cell ID and the sector ID. The PAPR reduction sequence<br>
having a length of NR is input to the sub-carrier allocator 211. The sub-carrier<br>
allocator 211 allocates sub-carriers to the signals output from the adders 209-1, ...,<br>
and 209-U, and the PAPR sequence so that the signals from the adders and the<br>
PAPR sequence can be carried by the sub-carriers, and then outputs a pilot<br><br>
symbol. Here, the pilot symbol output from the sub-carrier allocator 211 has a<br>
length of NP (Np =U.NH +NR).<br>
FIG. 3 is a block diagram illustrating an internal structure of a transmitter<br>
of an OFDM communication system according to an embodiment of the present<br>
invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 3, the transmitter (which may be a BS) includes a first<br>
modulator 301, a pilot generator 303, a second modulator 305, a selector 307, a<br>
serial-to-parallel converter 309, an Inverse Fast Fourier Transform (IFFT) unit<br>
311, a parallel-to-serial converter 313, a guard interval inserter 315, a digital-to-<br>
analog converter 317, and a Radio Frequency ('RF') processor 319.<br>
When there is data to be transmitted (i.e., information data bits), the<br>
information data bits are input to the first modulator 301. The first modulator 301<br>
generates a modulated symbol by modulating the input information data bits<br>
according to a predetermined modulation scheme and outputs the modulated<br>
symbol to the selector 307. Here, various schemes such as a QPSK (Quadrature<br>
Phase Shift Keying) scheme or a 16QAM (Quadrature Amplitude Modulation)<br>
scheme are available for the modulation scheme.<br>
When it is necessary to transmit a pilot symbol, a cell ID and a sector ID<br>
of a cell sector to which the pilot symbol will be transmitted and a PAPR<br>
reduction sequence set in advance that correspond to the cell ID and the sector ID<br>
are input to the pilot generator 303. The pilot generator 303 generates a pilot<br>
symbol by using the input cell ID, sector ID, and PAPR reduction sequence and<br>
outputs the generated pilot symbol to the second modulator 305. Here, the pilot<br>
generator 303 has an internal structure as shown in FIG. 2. Upon receiving the<br>
signal output from the pilot generator 303, the second modulator 305 generates a<br>
modulated symbol by modulating the signal according to a predetermined<br>
modulation scheme and outputs the modulated symbol to the selector 307. Here, a<br>
BPSK (Binary Phase Shift Keying) scheme, etc., may be used as the modulation<br>
scheme.<br>
In a data symbol transmission interval in which the transmitter must<br>
transmit a current data symbol, the selector 307 allows the signal from the first<br>
modulator 301 to be output to the serial-to-parallel converter 309. In contrast, in a<br>
pilot symbol transmission interval in which the transmitter must transmit a current<br>
pilot symbol, the selector 307 allows the signal from the second modulator 305 to<br>
be output to the serial-to-parallel converter 309. The serial-to-parallel converter<br>
309 converts the serial modulation symbols output from the selector 307 into<br>
parallel symbols and outputs the parallel symbols to the IFFT unit 311. The IFFT<br>
unit 311 performs an N-point IFFT on the signal output from the serial-to-parallel<br>
converter 309 and then outputs the IFFT-processed signal to the parallel-to-serial<br><br>
converter 313.<br>
The parallel-to-serial converter 313 converts the signals output from the<br>
IFFT unit 311 into a serial signal and outputs the serial signal to the guard interval<br>
inserter 315. The guard interval inserter 315 inserts guard intervals into the signal<br>
output from the parallel-to-serial converter 313 and then outputs a resultant signal<br>
to the digital-analog converter 317. The guard intervals are inserted in order to<br>
eliminate interference between an OFDM symbol transmitted during a previous<br>
OFDM symbol time and an OFDM symbol transmitted during a current OFDM<br>
symbol time. In inserting the guard intervals, a cyclic prefix method or a cyclic<br>
postfix method may be used. In the cyclic prefix method, a predetermined number<br>
of last samples of an OFDM symbol in a time domain are copied and inserted into<br>
a valid OFDM symbol. In the cyclic postfix method, a predetermined number of<br>
first samples of an OFDM symbol in a time domain are copied and inserted into a<br>
valid OFDM symbol.<br>
The digital-analog converter 317 converts the signal output from the<br>
guard interval inserter 315 into an analog signal and outputs the analog signal to<br>
the RF processor 319. Here, the RF processor 319 includes a filter and a front end<br>
unit, etc. The RF processor 319 processes the signal output from the digital-<br>
analog converter 317 and transmits the signal over the air through an antenna.<br>
FIG. 4 is a block diagram illustrating an internal structure of a receiver of<br>
an OFDM communication system according to an embodiment of the present<br>
invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 4, the receiver (which may be a mobile subscriber<br>
station (MSS)) includes an RF processor 401, an analog-to-digital converter 403,<br>
a guard interval remover 405, a serial-to-parallel converter 407, a Fast Fourier<br>
Transform (FFT) unit 409, a parallel-to-serial converter 411, a selector 413, a first<br>
demodulator 415, a second demodulator 417, and a cell ID/sector ID detector 419.<br>
A signal transmitted from the transmitter of the OFDM communication<br>
system together with noise added to the signal while the signal passes through a<br>
multipath channel is received via a receive antenna. The signal received through<br>
the receive antenna is input to the RF processor 401. The RF processor 401 down-<br>
converts the signal received through the reception signal into a signal having an<br>
intermediate frequency band and outputs the down-converted signal to the<br>
analog-to-digital converter 403. The analog-to-digital converter 403 converts the<br>
analog signal from the RF processor 401 into a digital signal and outputs the<br>
digital signal to the guard interval remover 405.<br>
Upon receiving the digital signal from the analog-to-digital converter 403,<br>
the guard interval remover 405 removes the guard interval from the digital signal<br>
and outputs the signal to the serial-to-parallel converter 407. The serial-to-parallel<br><br>
converter 407 converts the serial signal into parallel signals and sends the parallel<br>
signals to the FFT unit 409. The FFT unit 409 performs an N-point FFT on the<br>
parallel signals output from the serial-to-parallel converter 407 and outputs the<br>
FFT-processed signals to the parallel-to-serial converter 411.<br>
The parallel-to-serial converter 411 converts the parallel signals from the<br>
FFT unit 409 into a serial signal and sends the serial signal to the selector 413. In<br>
a data symbol reception interval in which the receiver must receive a current data<br>
symbol, the selector 413 allows the signal from the parallel-to-serial converter<br>
411 to be sent to the first demodulator 415. In contrast, in a pilot symbol<br>
reception interval in which the receiver must receive a current pilot symbol, the<br>
selector 413 allows the signal from the parallel-to-serial converter 411 to be sent<br>
to the second demodulator 417. The first demodulator 415 demodulates the signal<br>
output from the selector 413 according to a demodulation scheme corresponding<br>
to the modulation scheme employed in the transmitter and outputs data (i.e.<br>
information data bits) restored through the demodulation.<br>
Meanwhile, the second demodulator 417 demodulates the signal output<br>
from the selector 413 according to a demodulation scheme corresponding to the<br>
modulation scheme employed in the transmitter and outputs a pilot signal restored<br>
through the demodulation to the cell ID/sector ID detector 419. The cell ID/sector<br>
ID detector 419 receives the pilot signal from the demodulator 417 and detects a<br>
cell ID and a sector ID corresponding to the pilot signal. Here, the pilot signal is a<br>
signal generated that corresponds to the cell ID and the sector ID and are defined<br>
in advance by a protocol between the transmitter and the receiver.<br>
FIG. 5 is a block diagram illustrating an internal structure of the cell<br>
ID/sector ID detector 419 of FIG. 4.<br>
Referring to FIG. 5, the cell ID/sector ID detector 419 includes a pilot<br>
extractor 501, a Walsh code repeater 503, U number of adders 505-1, ..., and 505-<br>
U, U number of deinterleavers 507-1, ..., and 507-U, U number of Inverse Fast<br>
Hadamard Transform (IFHT) units 509-1, ..., and 509-U, and a comparison<br>
selector 511.<br>
The signal output from the demodulator 417 of FIG. 4 is input to the pilot<br>
extractor 501. The pilot extractor 501 extracts a U-NH number of symbols by<br>
eliminating the PAPR sequence from the signal output from the demodulator 417,<br>
divides the extracted symbols into a U number of symbols each having a length of<br>
NH, and outputs the divided symbols to the U number of adders 505-1, ..., and<br>
505-U. Further, the Walsh code repeater 503 repeatedly outputs Walsh codes<br>
corresponding to all of the sector IDs which can be identified by the receiver,<br>
sequentially selects one Walsh code from among the Walsh codes corresponding<br>
to all of the sector IDs, and repeatedly outputs the selected Walsh code to the U<br><br>
number of adders 505-1, ..., and 505-U.<br>
The U number of adders 505-1, ..., and 505-U perform an exclusive OR<br>
(XOR) operation on the signals output from the pilot extractor 501 and the signals<br>
output from the Walsh code repeater 503 and send the XOR-operated signals to<br>
the U number of deinterleavers 507-1, ..., and 507-U, respectively. The U number<br>
of deinterleavers 507-1, ..., and 507-U deinterleave the signals output from the U<br>
adders 505-1, ..., and 505-U according to the same interleaving scheme as that<br>
employed by the interleavers in the pilot generator of the transmitter (i.e. the U<br>
interleavers 207-1, ..., and 207-U of FIG. 2) and output the deinterleaved signals<br>
to the U IFHT units 509-1, ..., and 509-U, respectively. The U IFHT units 509-1,<br>
..., and 509-U receive the signals from the U deinterleavers 507-1, ..., and 507-U,<br>
perform correlation (that is, perform an IFHT) for each row of the Walsh<br>
Hadamard matrix corresponding to all of the cell IDs which can be identified by<br>
the receiver and the Walsh codes corresponding to all of the sector IDs, and<br>
output the correlated signals to the comparison selector 511.<br>
The comparison selector 511 receives the signals from the U IFHT units<br>
509-1, ..., and 509-U, selects a maximum correlation value from among the<br>
correlation values for each row of the Walsh Hadamard matrix corresponding to<br>
all of the cell IDs and the Walsh codes corresponding to all of the sector IDs, and<br>
outputs a cell ID and a sector ID corresponding to the selected maximum<br>
correlation value.<br>
FIG. 6 is a flowchart of an operation process of a transmitter in an OFDM<br>
communication system according to an embodiment of the present invention.<br>
In the following description with reference to FIG. 6, only the<br>
transmission of the pilot signal by the transmitter will be discussed, and the<br>
transmission of the data signal will not be dealt with in detail since the latter has<br>
no direct relation to the present invention.<br>
In step 611, the transmitter generates a pilot symbol by using a cell ID of<br>
the transmitter, a sector ID, and a PAPR reduction sequence. In step 613, the<br>
transmitter generates a modulated symbol by modulating the pilot symbol<br>
according to a preset modulation scheme such as a BPSK (Binary Phase Shift<br>
Keying) scheme. In step 615, the transmitter transmits the modulated pilot symbol<br>
in a pilot symbol interval and ends the process. Although not shown in FIG. 6, a<br>
frequency offset may be taken into consideration while transmitting the pilot<br>
symbol. That is, the location at which the pilot symbol begins may be set<br>
differently for each cell and each sector. Also, in a system using multiple transmit<br>
antennas, the pilot symbol may be transmitted by the transmit antennas which are<br>
set to have different frequency offsets.<br>
FIG. 7 is a flowchart of an operation process of a receiver in an OFDM<br><br>
communication system according to an embodiment of the present invention.<br>
In the following description with reference to FIG. 7, only the reception<br>
of the pilot signal by the receiver will be discussed, and the reception of the data<br>
signal will not be dealt with in detail since the latter has no direct relation to the<br>
present invention.<br>
In step 711, the receiver receives the pilot symbol in a pilot symbol<br>
interval. Although not shown in FIG. 7, when the transmitter has transmitted the<br>
pilot symbol while taking into consideration the frequency offset as described<br>
above in relation to FIG. 6, the receiver determines the signal reception location<br>
corresponding to the frequency offset before receiving the pilot symbol. In step<br>
713, the receiver demodulates the pilot symbol according to a demodulation<br>
scheme corresponding to the modulation scheme employed by the transmitter. In<br>
step 715, the receiver performs correlation (that is, performs an IFHT) on the<br>
demodulated pilot symbol for each row of the Walsh Hadamard matrix<br>
corresponding to all of the cell IDs which can be identified by the receiver and the<br>
Walsh codes corresponding to all of the sector IDs, detects a cell ID and a sector<br>
ID having a maximum correlation value as the cell ID and the sector ID of the<br>
transmitter, and ends the process.<br>
FIG. 8 is a schematic view for illustrating a mapping relation between<br>
sub-carriers and pilot symbols when an IFFT is perform in an OFDM<br>
communication system according to an embodiment of the present invention.<br>
FIG. 8 is based on an assumption that the number of sub-carriers in the<br>
OFDM communication system is 2048 and the exact number of actually used<br>
sub-carriers from among the 2048 sub-carriers is 1552, in other words, 1552 sub-<br>
carriers including 776 sub-carriers from a sub-carrier of No. -776 to a sub-carrier<br>
of No. -1 and 776 sub-carriers from a sub-carrier of No. 1 to a sub-carrier of No.<br>
776 are actually used from among the 2048 sub-carriers in the system. In FIG. 8,<br>
the number of each input port of the IFFT unit (that is, k) denotes an index of<br>
each sub-carrier.<br>
The sub-carrier of No. 0 represents a reference point for the pilot symbols<br>
in the time domain, that is, a DC component in the time domain after the IFFT is<br>
performed. Therefore, a null data is inserted into the sub-carrier of No. 0. Further,<br>
the null data is also inserted into all other sub-carriers other than the 1552 actually<br>
used sub-carriers, that is, into the sub-carriers from the sub-carrier of No. -777 to<br>
the sub-carrier of No. -1024 and the sub-carriers from the sub-carrier of No. 777<br>
to the sub-carrier of No. 1023. Here, the reason why the null data is inserted into<br>
the sub-carriers from the sub-carrier of No. -777 to the sub-carrier of No. -1024<br>
and the sub-carriers from the sub-carrier of No. 777 to the sub-carrier of No. 1023<br>
is that the sub-carriers from the sub-carrier of No. -777 to the sub-carrier of No. -<br><br>
1024 and the sub-carriers from the sub-carrier of No. 777 to the sub-carrier of No.<br>
1023 correspond to guard bands for preventing interference with another system<br>
using a neighboring frequency band.<br>
When a pilot symbol of the frequency domain are input to the IFFT unit,<br>
the IFFT unit performs an IFFT by mapping the input pilot symbol of the<br>
frequency domain to corresponding sub-carriers, thereby outputting a pilot<br>
symbol of the time domain.<br>
FIG. 9 illustrates a frame structure of a pilot symbol in the time domain of<br>
an OFDM communication system according to an embodiment of the present<br>
invention. Referring to FIG. 9, the pilot symbol includes twice repeated symbols<br>
each having the same length of pc (i.e., the same length of NFFT/2) and a guard<br>
interval signal added to the front end of the twice repeated symbols. The guard<br>
interval signal is inserted according to the Cyclic Prefix (CP) scheme as described<br>
above taking into consideration the characteristics of the OFDM communication<br>
system. Here, NFFT denotes the number of points of the IFFT/FFT operation used<br>
in the OFDM communication system.<br>
FIG. 10 illustrates a structure of a pilot symbol in the frequency domain<br>
of an OFDM communication system according to an embodiment of the present<br>
invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 10, the sub-carrier interval, except for the guard bands<br>
(i.e. guard intervals) 1001 and 1007, includes a correlation interval 1003 and a<br>
PAPR interval 1005. The correlation interval 1003 is comprised of sequences<br>
having large correlation values, and the PAPR interval 1005 is comprised of<br>
PAPR reduction sequences corresponding to the sequences in the correlation<br>
interval 1003. The calculation of the correlation values as described above with<br>
reference to FIG. 5 is performed only for the correlation interval 1003. In FIG. 10,<br>
H128 denotes a 128th order Walsh Hadamard matrix, and n,() denotes an<br>
interleaving scheme having a length of 128 by which columns of the 128th order<br>
Walsh Hadamard matrix are interleaved. Further, W(.) denotes a Walsh code<br>
masking. The pilot symbol is generated by frequency domain sequences as<br>
expressed by Equation 1 below.<br><br><br>
In Equation 1, IDcell denotes a cell ID (i.e. ID of a BS), s denotes a sector<br>
ID, k denotes a sub-carrier index, Nused denotes a number of sub-carriers in which<br>
null data is not inserted, and m denotes a running index of sequence qID . In the<br>
present embodiment, it is assumed that the pilot symbols of all of the BSs and<br>
sectors use the same frequency offset. According to the frequency domain<br>
sequence PID [k] as shown in Equation 1, the values in the form as shown in<br>
Equation 1 are assigned only to sub-carriers having an even number of indices,<br>
and a value of 0 is unconditionally assigned to all sub-carriers having an odd<br>
number of indices. Therefore, when the IFFT operation has been performed, the<br>
same sequence is repeated twice in the time domain.<br><br><br><br><br>
interleaving is achieved by arranging the 128 elements of a selected row of the<br>
128th Walsh Hadamard matrix in the order as shown in Table 1. Here, the<br><br>
interleaving scheme   is a scheme of permuting the 128 elements of the<br>
frequency domain sequence having a length of 128 in the order as<br>
shown in Table 1. Numbers in Table 1 denote indices of sub-carriers to which the<br>
128 elements of the frequency domain sequenceare one-to-one<br>
mapped. <br>
The value of  is determined as the<br>
PAPR reduction sequence minimizing the PAPR of the pilot symbol. Table 2<br>
contains PAPR reduction sequences corresponding to the cell IDs and sector IDs<br>
and PAPRs of pilot symbols corresponding to the cell IDs and sector IDs.<br><br><br><br>
The method of transmitting/receiving pilot signals as described above<br>
may also be employed in an OFDM communication system using a Multiple<br>
Input Multiple Output (MIMO) scheme and requiring no sector differentiation. In<br>
such an OFDM communication system, since it is unnecessary to differentiate or<br>
identify sectors, a predetermined Walsh code (e.g. all 1 Walsh codes, all of which<br>
have a value of 1) may be used for all of the sectors, instead of the different Walsh<br>
codes corresponding to the different sector identifiers employed in the pilot<br>
transmission/reception method as described above.<br>
Further, when a transmitter (e.g. a BS) of the OFDM communication<br>
system uses an Nt number of transmit antennas, the pilot symbols transmitted<br>
through each of the Nt transmit antennas can be expressed by Equation 3 below.<br>
^ \i_ - _i/<br>
In Equation 4, each of the sequences R(r) and T(k) is defined according to<br><br>
the number Nt of transmit antennas and the number of points of the IFFT/FFT<br>
operation used in the OFDM communication system, so that the  is also<br>
defined according to the number Nt of transmit antennas and the number of points<br>
of the IFFT/FFT operation used in the OFDM communication system.<br>
The above-mentioned according to the number<br>
Nt of transmit antennas and the number NFFT of points of the IFFT/FFT operation<br>
used in the OFDM communication system will be described.<br>
3/4-r M<br>
When the number Nt of transmit antennas is two and the number of the<br>
IFFT/FFT operation points used in the OFDM communication system is 2048 (i.e.<br>
Nt = 2, NFFT = 2048), R(r) can be expressed by Equation 5 below and T(k) and<br>
IID [m] can be expressed by the hexadecimal numbers as shown in Table 3 and<br>
Tables 4a through 4f.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
When the number Nt of the transmit antennas is two and the number of<br>
the IFFT/FFT operation points used in the OFDM communication system is 1024<br>
(i.e. Nt = 2, NFFT = 1024), R(r) can be expressed by Equation 6 below and T(k)<br>
and   can be expressed by the hexadecimal numbers as shown in Table 5<br>
and Tables 6a through 6d.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
When the number Nt of the transmit antennas is two and the number of<br>
the IFFT/FFT operation points used in the OFDM communication system is 512<br>
(i.e. N, = 2, NFFT = 512), R(r) can be expressed by Equation 7 and T(k) and<br>
  can be expressed by the hexadecimal numbers as shown in Table 7 and<br>
Tables 8a and 8b.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

ABSTRACT<br><br>
TITLE: A METHOD AND AN APPARATUS FOR TRANSMITTING PILOT SIGNAL IN<br>
COMMUNICATION SYSTEM USING OFDM SCHEME<br>
The invention relates to a method for transmitting a pilot symbol from base<br>
stations (BSs) to a subscriber station (SS) in a communication system which<br>
includes the base stations located adjacent to each other, the method includes<br>
the steps of transmitting BS-identifying sub-carriers which represent sequences<br>
for identifying the base stations in a frequency domain of the pilot symbol; and<br>
transmitting PAPR (Peak to Average Power Ratio) sub-carriers which represent<br>
sequences for reducing a PAPR of the pilot symbol together with the<br>
transmission of the BS-identifying sub-carriers in the frequency domain.</td>
