				<td>Field of the Invention<br>
The invention relates generally to a tractor and method for facilitating conversion thereof, and more specifically to a tractor with an interchangeable front wheel assembly and variable rear wheel track width.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Generally, tractors are designed with the large landowner and corporate farms in mind. For example, the components of the tractor (i.e., the engine, electrical system, and transmission) are highly integrated. Therefore, in the event of mechanical or electrical problems the tractor requires service by highly specialized technicians and transportation of the tractor to the repair shop for even the most minor of malfunctions. In many developing nations, the farmer must often be the service technician, and thus be able to locate and repair any failures that may happen without requiring the entire tractor be taken into the repair shop.<br>
Furthermore, the turning radius of most tractors is tailored to the large empty spaces that exist in most fields of the large land owner or corporate farmer; Most often, the front end of the tractor includes a fixedly attached two wheel assembly and a fixed rear wheel track width. The farmers of many developing nations typically have land tracts that are a fraction of the size of those for which most tractors are designed, and cannot afford empty spaces at the ends thereof dedicated only to the turning of the tractor.<br>
2<br><br>
Therefore, there exists a need for a service friendly tractor having a variable rear wheel track width and an adaptable front end to vary the turning radius as heeded.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
The present invention provides a tractor having a front end and a rear end, said tractor being adaptable to a plurality of front wheel assemblies, said tractor comprising :<br>
one of said plurality of front wheel assemblies;<br>
an attachment mechanism at said front end of said tractor, said attachment mechanism configured to selectively attach said one of said plurality of front wheel assemblies to said front end of said tractor;<br>
a steering actuator, said steering actuator being fixedly attached to a steering mechanism of said tractor, and being selectively attached to said one of said plurality of front wheel assemblies; and<br>
a power transmission unit, the power transmission unit comprising :<br>
a clutch assembly;<br>
a gear box in communication with the clutch assembly,<br>
said gear box comprising :<br>
an input shaft for providing power from an engine of said tractor,<br>
a first output shaft shaft in communication with said input shaft, said first output shaft comprising two gears, a first gear for providing a low range speed and a second gear for providing a high range speed;<br>
3<br><br>
a lay shaft in communication with said first output shaft, said lay shaft comprising a first gear, a second, and a reverse gear; and<br>
a second output shaft in communication with said lay shaft and in removable communication with said first output shaft, said second output shaft comprising a first shifter gear in removable communication with said first gear of the lay shaft and said reverse gear of said lay shaft, and a second shifter gear in removable communication with said second gear of said lay shaft and a set of splines; and<br>
a rear end differential box in communication with said gear box, said rear end differential box comprising a set of final gears for delivering power to said rear end of said tractor, wherein each of said gears of the gear box and said rear end differential is viewable when a top cover of each of said gear box and said rear end differential box is removed.<br>
Thus, the invention is directed to a tractor having an interchangeable front wheel assembly and an adjustable rear wheel track width. The removable front wheel assembly allows for easy conversion between a single wheel and a two wheel front wheel assembly. In combination with the interchangeable front wheel assembly, the adjustable rear wheel track width allows for the manipulation of the turning radius of the tractor. Additionally, the modular design of the components of the tractor facilitate repair of individual components without the need for bringing the entire tractor in for repair.<br>
3A<br><br>
In one aspect, the invention is directed to a tractor. The tractor has a front end and rear end.  The tractor includes a front wheel assembly, an attachment mechanism, and a steering actuator. The attachment mechanism is at the front end of the tractor and is configured to removably attach the front wheel assembly to the tractor. The steering actuator is fixedly attached to a steering mechanism on the tractor.   Also, the steering actuator is removably attached to the front wheel assembly.   The front wheel assembly may include one wheel or two wheels.<br>
In one embodiment, the attachment mechanism may include a mounting mechanism that receives a corresponding mounting mechanism, which is part of the front wheel assembly. The mounting mechanisms can include bores that receive fasteners to attach the front wheel assembly to the front end of the tractor.<br>
In another embodiment, the rear end of the tractor includes a rear axle, two rear wheels, and a spacer placed between each of the wheels and the axle. The spacer allows the width between the rear wheels to be adjusted. For example, the width of the rear wheels may be greater than or equal to the width of the front wheel assembly having two wheels.<br>
In another embodiment, the tractor includes a power transmission unit having a clutch assembly, a gear box and a rear end differential box. The clutch assembly is in communication with the gear box.<br>

Detailed Description of the Invention<br><br>
With reference to FIGS. 1A-1C, in one embodiment a tractor 10 includes a front wheel assembly 20 attached to a chassis 30, which includes a rear wheel<br>
6<br><br>
assembly 40. The front wheel assembly 20 includes, in one embodiment, a pair of front wheels 22A and 22B attached to a front axle 24. The front axle 24 can be a solid front axle or a split front axle to provide independent suspension of the two front wheels 22A and 22B. A pair of steering joints 28A and 28B are attached to a stabilizer bar 28C to facilitate turning of the front wheels 22A and 22B. Additionally, a steering actuator 50 is removably attached to a steering actuator attachment mechanism 29. The steering actuator 50 is fixedly attached to a steering mechanism (e.g., a steering wheel) on the chassis 30 of the tractor 10.<br>
As an operator turns the steering wheel 52 the steering mechanism 54 of, the chassis 30, the steering actuator 50, the steering actuator attachment mechanism 29, the steering joints 28A and 28B and the stabilizer bar 28C cooperate to facilitate the turning of the front wheels 22A and 22B. For example, if the steering wheel 52 is turned to the right, the steering actuator 50 is pulled, back (i.e., towards the rear wheel assembly 40). In turn, the steering actuator attachment mechanism 29 is pulled back (i.e., moves toward the rear wheel assembly) and thus the steering joints 28A and 28B and stabilizer bar 28C cooperate to turn the front wheels 22A and 22B to the right. In order to facilitate a left turn, the steering wheel 52 forces the steering actuator 50 forward (i.e., toward the front wheels 22A and 22B).    Similar to the above, the steering actuator attachment mechanism 29 is pushed forward (i.e., moves toward the front wheels 22A and 22B) and thus the steering joints 28A and 28B and stabilizer bar 28C cooperate to turn the front wheels 22A and 22B to the left.<br>
7<br><br>
The front axle 24 is attached to a front wheel assembly attachment bar 26, which is removably attached to the chassis 30. The chassis 30 includes, at the front end, an attachment mechanism 32 configured to receive the front wheel assembly attachment bar 26. In more detail, the attachment mechanism 32 includes a mounting mechanism configured to receive a corresponding mounting mechanism of the front wheel assembly 20. In one embodiment, the mounting mechanisms are shaped to facilitate proper alignment and retention of the front wheel assembly 20 to the chassis 30. The mounting mechanisms include bores 34 adapted to receive fasteners 36. The fasteners 36 can include, but are not limited to bolts, rivets, pins and the like.<br>
With reference to FIGS. 2A-2E, in one embodiment the tractor 10 includes a front wheel assembly 20' attached to the chassis 30, which includes a rear wheel assembly 40. In one embodiment, the front wheel assembly 20' includes a single front wheel 22A'. The front wheel assembly 20' includes a pair of front forks 25A and 25B. The front forks 25A.and 25B are attached to a front axle 24' to hold the front wheel 22A' in place. Additionally, the front forks 25A and 25B are attached to a suspension mechanism 27 (e.g., a coil, leaf spring, shock, strut, hydraulic mechanism, or gas mechanism), which provides suspension of the front wheel assembly 20' during operation. The steering actuator 50 is removably attached to a steering actuator attachment mechanism 29', which is attached to at least one of the front forks 25A and 25B.<br>
8<br><br>
In more detail, the steering actuator 50 includes a pivot point 52, which removably attaches a steering actuator bar 54 to the steering actuator attachment mechanism 29'. The steering actuator attachment mechanism 29' includes an attachment point 58, which attaches the steering actuator bar 54 to the forks 25B. In one embodiment, the pivot point 52 is a bore configured to receive a pin on the steering actuator attachment mechanism 29'.<br>
As an operator turns the steering mechanism of the chassis the steering actuator 50 facilitates turning of the front wheel 22A'. For example, if the steering wheel 52 is turned to the right, the steering actuator 50 is pulled back (i.e., towards the rear wheel assembly 40). In turn, the steering actuator attachment mechanism 29' is pulled back (i.e., moves toward the rear wheel assembly) and the front wheel 22A1 turns to the right. In order to facilitate a left turn, the steering wheel 52 forces the steering actuator 50 forward (i.e., toward the front wheel 22A1). As described above, in turn, the steering actuator attachment mechanism 29' is pushed forward (i.e., moves toward the front wheel 22A') and the front wheel 22A' turns to the left.<br>
The suspension mechanism 27 is attached to a front wheel assembly attachment bar 26', which is removably attached to the chassis 30. The front wheel attachment bar 26' is shaped to provide attachment of the single front wheel assembly to the chassis at the same point as the two wheel configuration. The chassis 30 includes at the front end an attachment mechanism 32 to receive the front wheel assembly attachment bar 26'. In more detail as described above,<br>
9<br><br>
the attachment mechanism includes a mounting mechanism configured to receive a corresponding mounting mechanism of the front wheel assembly 20. In one embodiment, the mounting mechanisms are shaped to facilitate proper alignment and retention of the front wheel assembly 20'. The mounting mechanisms include bores 34 adapted to receive fasteners 36. The fasteners 36 can include, but are not limited to bolts, rivets, pins and the like.<br>
It is often desirable to change between a front wheel assembly having one wheel and a front wheel assembly having two wheels. To accomplish this, a block, jack, or other height adjusting mechanism is placed under the chassis 30 to maintain the height of the chassis. The fasteners 36 are removed from the mounting mechanisms. Also, the steering actuator is removed from the front wheel assembly. Thereafter, the front wheel assembly is removed and replaced with the other front wheel assembly. The fasteners 36 are reattached to secure the front wheel assembly in place. In turn, the steering actuator is attached to the front wheel assembly.<br>
With reference to FIGS. 3A-3C, the track width of the rear wheel assembly 40 of the tractor 10 is adjustable to accommodate various crop spacings and farm implements. As shown in FIG. 3A, the rear wheel assembly 40 includes a rear axle 42, which transfers power to a rear axle flange 44. A pair of rear wheels 46A and 46B is attached to each rear axle flange 44. The rear axle 42 receives power from a rear differential, as described below in FIGS. 4A and 4B. As shown, the track width of the rear wheels is substantially equal to the width of the front wheel assembly 20 having two wheels.<br>
10<br><br>
With reference to FIG. 3B, the track width of the rear wheels can be increased by attaching a spacer 60 to the rear axle flange 44. The spacer 60 includes a spacer body 62, a rear axle attachment flange 64, a spacer axle 66, and a wheel attachment flange 68. In one embodiment, the spacer body is composed of cast iron, although other materials are possible. The rear axle attachment flange 64 is disposed at one end of the spacer body 62. The spacer axle 66 is disposed within the spacer body 62 and attached to the rear axle attachment flange 64 at one end of the spacer axle 66. The other end of the spacer axle 66 is attached to the wheel attachment flange 68. The wheel . attachment flange is substantially similar to the rear axle flange 44. The rear wheel is attached to the wheel attachment flange 68.<br>
To change the track width of the rear wheels, a block, jack, or other height adjustment mechanism is placed in communication with the chassis to hold the rear wheel assembly 40 at a height necessary to facilitate the removal of the rear wheels 46A and 46B. The rear wheels 46A and 46B are removed from the rear axle flange 44. The spacer body 62 is attached to the rear axle flange 44. More specifically, the rear axle attachment flange 64 is attached to the rear axle flange 44 by fasteners, such as, bolts. In turn, the rear wheels are attached to the wheel attachment flange 68. The spacer 60 thereby increases the track width of the rear wheel assembly 40 such that it is greater than the width of the front wheel assembly 20 having two wheels.<br>
The turning radius of the tractor is a direct function of the track width of the   rear  wheel   assembly and the front wheel assembly configuration. For<br>
11<br><br>
example, as shown in FIG. 3C, when a front wheel assembly 20' having only one wheel is used, the turning radius of the tractor 10 is less than the turning radius of a tractor 10 having a front wheel assembly 20 with two wheels. Additionally, if the track width of the rear wheels is increased using the spacer 60, as in FIG. 3B, the turning radius of the tractor is affected. As such, the turning radius of the tractor 10 is a function of the front wheel assemblies and the track width of the rear wheels.<br>
With reference to FIGS. 4A and 4B, the tractor 10 includes a transmission 100 having gear box 110 and a rear differential 114. An input shaft 118 transfers power from the engine of the tractor to the gear box 110. Power is transferred from the gear box 110 to the rear differential 114, which, in turn, rotates the rear axle 42 and turns the rear wheels 46A and 46B. The gear box 110 and rear differential 114 each include a top cover (not shown). Removing the top covers of each of the gear box 110 and rear differential 114 exposes the gears within. As such, the gears are easily accessible for trouble shooting and repair.<br>
In more detail, the gear box 110 includes a portion of the input shaft 118, a first output shaft 122, a lay shaft 126, and a final output shaft 130. The input shaft 118 includes a first spindle 134A that engages a low range gear 138, and a second spindle 134B that engages a high range gear 142 on the first output shaft 122. The low range gear 138 and high range gear 142 allow two different speeds of rotation for each gear on the lay shaft 126. Power is transferred from the input shaft 118 to the lay shaft 126 via the first output shaft 122.<br>
12<br><br>
The lay shaft 126 includes a reverse gear 138, a first forward gear 142, and a second forward gear 146. A third forward gear is provided by transferring power directly from the first output shaft 122 to the final output shaft 130. A clutch (not shown) disengages the final output shaft 130 from the lay shaft 126 to thereby provide power directly from the first output shaft 122 to the final output shaft 130.<br>
The final output shaft 130 includes a first shifter gear 150 which engages<br>
the reverse gear 138 and the first forward gear 142. Also, the final output shaft<br><br>
includes a second shifter gear 154, which engages the second forward gear 146. The final output shaft is in communication with the rear differential 114.<br>
A set of final gears 158, a power take-off (PTO) shaft 162, a high power gear assembly 166, and high power pinion 170 are located in the rear differential 114. The final gears 158 receive power from the final output shaft 122 and deliver it to the rear axle 42 via the high power pinion 170 and high power gears 166.<br>
The PTO shaft 162 can provide two speeds ; one is directly proportional to the engine speed, and the other is proportional to the rotational speed of the rear wheels. To provide a PTO shaft speed proportional to the engine speed, a PTO gear 174, which is on the lay shaft 126, is selected by a PTO shifter (not shown). When selected, power is transferred from the lay shaft 126 to the PTO shaft 162. Alternatively, the PTO shaft can receive power from the high power pinion 170. As such, the speed of the PTO shaft 162 is directly proportional to the rotational speed of the rear wheels 46A and 46B.<br>
13<br><br>
In operation, the operator of the tractor 10 uses a gear selector (not shown) to select either one of the three forward gears or the reverse gear. More specifically, the gear selector may cause either of the shifter gears 150 or 154 to engage one of the forward gears 142 or 146 or the reverse gear 138. Additionally, the operator uses a high/low range selector (e.g., a hand clutch or the like) to select an operating range of the gears. More specifically, by selecting the high range, the high range gear 142 engages the second spindle 134B. Alternatively, if the low range is desired, the low range gear 138 engages the first spindle 134A.<br>
As the engine runs, power from the input shaft 118 is transferred to the first output shaft 122 via the first spindle 134A or the second spindle 134B. The .    gear ratio between the first spindle 134A and the low range gear 138 or the second spindle 134B and the high range gear 142 determines the rotational speed of the first output shaft 122.    In turn, power maybe transferred either directly to the final output shaft 130, if the third forward gear is selected. Alternatively, power is transferred to the lay shaft 126 if one of the first forward gear 142, second forward gear 146, or reverse gear 138 is selected. Depending on the gear selected, the rotational speed of the final output shaft is determined by the gear ratio between the chosen shifter gear and the gear on the lay shaft that the shifter gear engages. Power from the final output shaft 130 is transferred to the final gear 158, and, in turn, to the high power pinion 170. The high power gear assembly 166 receives the power from the high power pinion 170 and rotates the rear axle 42. Although described as having six forward speeds and<br>
14<br><br>
two reverse speeds (i.e., a high and low range for each of the forward and reverse gears), the transmission is not limited to any particular number of gears. Having shown the preferred embodiments, one skilled in the art will realize that many variations are possible within the scope and spirit of the claimed invention. It is therefore the intention to limit the invention only by the scope of the claims.<br>
