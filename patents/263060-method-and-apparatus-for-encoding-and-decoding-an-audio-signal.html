				<td>METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR ENCODING AND DECODING AN AUDIO<br>
SIGNAL<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to an audio signal<br>
processing, and more particularly, to an apparatus for<br>
encoding and decoding an audio signal and method thereof.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Generally, an audio signal encoding apparatus<br>
compresses an audio signal into a mono or stereo type<br>
downmix signal instead of compressing each channels of a<br>
multi-channel audio signal. The audio signal encoding<br>
apparatus transfers the compressed downmix signal to a<br>
decoding apparatus together with a spatial information<br>
signal (or, ancillary data signal) or stores the compressed<br>
downmix signal and the spatial information signal in a<br>
storage medium.<br>
In this case, the spatial information signal, which<br>
is extracted in downmixing a multi-channel audio signal, is<br>
used in restoring an original multi-channel audio signal<br>
from a compressed downmix signal.<br>
The spatial information signal includes a header and<br>
1<br><br>
spatial information. And, configuration information is<br>
included in the header. The header is the information for<br>
interpreting the spatial information.<br>
An audio signal decoding apparatus decodes the<br>
spatial information using the configuration information<br>
included in the header. The configuration information,<br>
which is included in the header, is transferred to a<br>
decoding apparatus or stored in a storage medium together<br>
with the spatial information.<br>
An audio signal encoding apparatus multiplexes an<br>
encoded downmix signal and the spatial information signal<br>
together into a bitstream form and then transfers the<br>
multiplexed signal to a decoding apparatus. Since<br>
configuration information is invariable in general, a<br>
header including configuration information is inserted in a<br>
bitstream once. Since configuration information is<br>
transmitted with being initially inserted in an audio<br>
signal once, an audio signal decoding apparatus has a<br>
problem in decoding spatial information due to non-<br>
existence of configuration information in case of<br>
reproducing the audio signal from a random timing point.<br>
Namely, since an audio signal is reproduced from a specific<br>
tirring point requested by a user instead of being<br>
reproduced from an initial part in case of a broadcast, VOD<br>
2<br><br>
(video on demand) or the like, it is unable to use<br>
configuration information transferred by being included in<br>
an audio signal. So, it may be unable to decode spatial<br>
information.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide a<br>
method and apparatus for encoding and decoding an audio<br>
signal which enables the audio signal to be decoded by<br>
making header selectively included in a frame in the<br>
spatial information signal.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide<br>
a method and apparatus for encoding and decoding an audio<br>
signal which enables the audio signal to be decoded even if<br>
the audio signal is reproduced from a random point by the<br>
audio signal decoding apparatus by making a plurality of<br>
headers included in a spatial information signal.<br>
To achieve these and other advantages and in<br>
accordance with the purpose of the present invention, as<br>
embodied and broadly described, a method of decoding an<br>
audio signal according to the present invention includes<br>
receiving the audio signal including a downmix signal and a<br>
spatial information signal, if a header is included in the<br>
spatial information signal, extracting configuration<br>
3<br><br>
information from the header, extracting spatial information<br>
included in the spatial information signal, and converting<br>
the downmix signal to a multi-channel signal using the<br>
configuration information and the spatial information.<br>

BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
Reference will now be made in detail to the preferred<br>
embodiments of the present invention, examples of which are<br>
illustrated in the accompanying drawings.<br>
For understanding of the present invention, an<br>
apparatus and method of encoding an audio signal is<br>
explained prior to an apparatus and method of decoding an<br>
audio signal. Yet, the decoding apparatus and method<br>
according to the present invention are not limited to the<br>
following encoding apparatus and method. And, the present<br>
invention is applicable to an audio coding scheme for<br>
generating a multi-channel using spatial information as<br>
well as MP3 (MPEG 1/2-layer III) and AAC (advanced audio<br>
coding).<br>
5<br><br>
FIG. 1 is a configurational diagram of an audio<br>
signal transferred to an audio signal decoding apparatus<br>
from an audio signal encoding apparatus according to one<br>
embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 1, an audio signal includes an<br>
audio descriptor 101, a downmix signal 103 and a spatial<br>
information signal 105.<br>
In case of using a coding scheme for reproducing an<br>
audio signal for broadcasting or the like, the audio signal<br>
may include ancillary data as well as the audio descriptor<br>
101 and the downmix signal 103. The present invention may<br>
include the spatial information signal 105 as ancillary<br>
data. In order for an audio signal decoding apparatus to<br>
know basic information of audio codec without analyzing an<br>
audio signal, the audio signal may selectively include the<br>
audio descriptor 101. The audio descriptor 101 is comprised<br>
of small number of basic informations necessary for audio<br>
decoding such as a transmission rate of a transmitted audio<br>
signal, a number of channels, a sampling frequency of<br>
compressed data, an identifier indicating a currently used<br>
codec and the like.<br>
An audio signal decoding apparatus is able to know a<br>
type of a codec used by an audio signal using the audio<br>
descriptor 101. In particular, using the audio descriptor<br>
6<br><br>
101, the audio signal decoding apparatus is able to know<br>
whether a received audio signal is the signal restoring a<br>
multi-channel using the spatial information signal 105 and<br>
the downmix signal 103. In this case, the multi-channel may<br>
include a virtual 3-dimensional surround as well as an<br>
actual multi-channel. By the virtual 3-dimensional surround<br>
technology, an audio signal having the spatial information<br>
signal 105 and the downmix signal 103 combined together is<br>
made audible through one or two channels.<br>
The audio descriptor 101 is located independent from<br>
the downmix or the spatial information signal 103 or 105<br>
included in the audio signal. For instance, the audio<br>
descriptor 101 is located within a separate field<br>
indicating an audio signal.<br>
In case that a header is not provided to the downmix<br>
signal 103, the audio signal decoding apparatus is able to<br>
decode the downmix signal 103 using the audio descriptor<br>
101.<br>
The downmix signal 103 is a signal generated from<br>
downmixing a multi-channel. The downmix signal 103 can be<br>
generated from a downmixing unit (not shown in the drawing)<br>
included in an audio signal encoding apparatus (not shown<br>
in the drawing) or generated artificially.<br>
The downmix signal 103 can be categorized into a case<br>
7<br><br>
of including the spatial information signal 105 and a case<br>
of not including the header.<br>
In case that the downmix signal 103 includes the<br>
header, the header is included in each frame by a frame<br>
unit. In case that the downmix signal 103 does not include<br>
the header, as mentioned in the foregoing description, the<br>
downmix signal 103 can be decoded using the audio<br>
descriptor 101 by an audio signal decoding apparatus. The<br>
downmix signal 103 takes either a form of including the<br>
header for each frame or a form of not including the header.<br>
And, the downmix signal 103 is included in an audio signal<br>
in a same manner until contents end.<br>
The spatial information signal 105 is also<br>
categorized into a case of including the header and spatial<br>
information and a case of including the spatial information<br>
only without including the header. The header of the<br>
spatial information signal 105 differs from that of the<br>
downmix signal 103 in that it is unnecessary to be inserted<br>
in each frame identically. In particular, the spatial<br>
information signal 105 is able to use a frame including the<br>
header and a frame not including the header together. Most<br>
of information included in the header of the spatial<br>
information signal 105 is configuration information that<br>
decodes the spatial information by interpreting the spatial<br>
8<br><br>
information.<br>
FIG. 2 is a configurational diagram of an audio<br>
signal transferred to an audio signal decoding apparatus<br>
from an audio signal encoding apparatus according to<br>
another embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 2, an audio signal includes the<br>
downmix signal 103 and the spatial information signal 105.<br>
And, the audio signal exists in an ES (elementary stream)<br>
form that frames are arranged.<br>
Each of the downmix signal 103 and the spatial<br>
information signal 105 is occasionally transferred as a<br>
separate ES form to an audio signal decoding apparatus. And<br>
the downmix signal 103 and the spatial information signal<br>
105, as shown in FIG. 2, can be combined into one ES form<br>
to be transferred to the audio signal decoding apparatus.<br>
In case that the downmix signal 103 and the spatial<br>
information signal 105, which are combined into one ES form,<br>
are transferred to the audio signal decoding apparatus, the<br>
spatial information signal 105 can be included in a<br>
position of ancillary data (ancillary data) or additional<br>
data (extension data) of the downmix signal 103.<br>
And, the audio signal may include signal<br>
identification information indicating whether the spatial<br>
informatic: n signal 105 is combined with the downmix signal<br>
9<br><br>
103.<br>
A frame of the spatial information signal 105 can be<br>
categorized into a case of including the header 201 and the<br>
spatial information 203 and a case of including the spatial<br>
information 203 only. In particular, the spatial<br>
information signal 105 is able to use a frame including the<br>
header 201 and a frame not including the header 201<br>
together.<br>
In the present invention, the header 201 is inserted<br>
in the spatial information signal 105 at least once. In<br>
particular, an audio signal encoding apparatus may insert<br>
the header 201 into each frame in the spatial information<br>
signal 105, periodically insert the header 201 into each<br>
fixed interval of frames in the spatial information signal<br>
105 or non-periodically insert the header 201 into each<br>
random interval of frames in the spatial information signal<br>
105.<br>
The audio signal may include information (hereinafter<br>
named header identification information') indicating<br>
whether the header 201 is included in a frame 201.<br>
In case that the header 201 is included in the<br>
spatial information signal 105, the audio signal decoding<br>
apparatus extracts the configuration information 205 from<br>
the header 201 and then decodes the spatial informatior 203<br>
10<br><br>
transferred after (behind) the header 201 according to the<br>
configuration information 205. Since the header 201 is<br>
information for decoding by interpreting the spatial<br>
information 203, the header 201 is transferred in the early<br>
stage of transferring the audio signal.<br>
In case that the header 201 is not included in the<br>
spatial information signal 105, the audio signal decoding<br>
apparatus decodes the spatial information 203 using the<br>
header 201 transferred in the early stage.<br>
In case that the header 201 is lost while the audio<br>
signal is transferred to the audio signal decoding<br>
apparatus from the audio signal encoding apparatus or in<br>
case that the audio signal transferred in a streaming<br>
format is decoded from its middle part to be used for<br>
broadcasting or the like, it is unable to use the header<br>
201 that was previously transferred. In this case, the<br>
audio signal decoding apparatus extracts the configuration<br>
information 205 from the header 201 different from the<br>
former header 201 firstly inserted in the audio signal and<br>
is then able to decode the audio signal using the extracted<br>
configuration information 205. In this case, the<br>
configuration information 205 extracted from the header 201<br>
inserted in the audio s Lgnal may be identical to the former<br>
configuration information 205 extracted from the header 201<br>
11<br><br>
which had been transferred in the early stage or may not.<br>
If the header 201 is variable, the configuration<br>
information 205 is extracted from a new header 201, the<br>
extracted configuration information 205 is decoded and the<br>
spatial information 203 transmitted behind the header 201<br>
is then decoded. If the header 201 is invariable, it is<br>
decided whether the new header 201 is identical to the old<br>
header 201 that was previously transferred. If theses two<br>
headers 201 are different from each other, it can be<br>
detected that an error occurs in an audio signal on an<br>
audio signal transfer path.<br>
The configuration information 205 extracted from the<br>
header 201 of the spatial information signal 105 is the<br>
information to interpret the spatial information 203.<br>
The spatial information signal 105 is able to include<br>
information (hereinafter named xtime align information' )<br>
for discriminating a time delay difference between two<br>
signals in generating a multi-channel using the downmix<br>
signal 103 and the spatial information signal 105 by the<br>
audio signal decoding apparatus.<br>
An audio signal transferred to the audio signal<br>
decoding apparatus from the audio signal encoding apparatus<br>
is parsed by a demultiplexing unit (not shown in the<br>
drawing) and is then separated into the downmix signal 103<br>
12<br><br>
and the spatial information signal 105.<br>
The downmix signal 103 separated by the<br>
demultiplexing unit is decoded. A decoded downmix signal<br>
103 generates a multi-channel using the spatial information<br>
signal 105. In generating the multi-channel by combining<br>
the downmix signal 103 and the spatial information signal<br>
105, the audio signal decoding apparatus is able to adjust<br>
synchronization between two signals, a position of a start<br>
point of combining two signals and the like using the time<br>
align information (not shown in the drawing) included in<br>
the configuration information 205 extracted from the header<br>
201 of the spatial information signal 105.<br>
Position information 207 of a time slot to which a<br>
parameter will be applied is included in the spatial<br>
information 203 included in the spatial information signal<br>
105. As a spatial parameter (spatial cue), there is CLDs<br>
(channel level differences) indicating an energy difference<br>
between audio signals, ICCs (interchannel correlations)<br>
indicating closeness or similarity between audio signals,<br>
CPCs (channel prediction coefficients) indicating a<br>
coefficient predicting an audio signal value using other<br>
signals. Hereinafter, each spatial cue or a bundle of<br>
spatial cues will be called 'parameter' .<br>
In case N parameters exist in i frame included in the<br>
13<br><br>
spatial information signal 105, the N parameters are<br>
applied to specific time slot positions of frames,<br>
respectively. If information indicating a parameter will be<br>
applied to which one of time slots included in a frame is<br>
named the position information 207 of the time slot, the<br>
audio signal decoding apparatus decodes the spatial<br>
information 203 using the position information 207 of the<br>
time slot to which the parameter will be applied. In this<br>
case, the parameter is included in the spatial information<br>
203.<br>
FIG. 3 is a schematic block diagram of an apparatus<br>
for decoding an audio signal according to one embodiment of<br>
the present invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 3, an apparatus for decoding an<br>
audio signal according to one embodiment of the present<br>
invention includes a receiving unit 301 and an extracting<br>
unit 303.<br>
The receiving unit 301 of the audio signal decoding<br>
apparatus receives an audio signal transferred in an ES<br>
form by an audio signal encoding apparatus via an input<br>
terminal INI.<br>
The audio signal received by the audio signal<br>
decoding apparatus includes an audio descriptor 101 and the<br>
downmix signal 103 and may further include the spatial<br>
14<br><br>
information signal 105 as ancillary data (ancillary data)<br>
or additional data (extension data).<br>
The extracting unit 303 of the audio signal decoding<br>
apparatus extracts the configuration information 205 from<br>
the header 201 included in the received audio signal and<br>
then outputs the extracted configuration information 205<br>
via an output terminal OUT1.<br>
The audio signal may include the header<br>
identification information for identifying whether the<br>
header 201 is included in a frame.<br>
The audio signal decoding apparatus identifies<br>
whether the header 201 is included in the frame using the<br>
header identification information included in the audio<br>
signal. If the header 201 is included, the audio signal<br>
decoding apparatus extracts the configuration information<br>
205 from the header 201. In the present invention, at least<br>
one header 201 is included in the spatial information<br>
signal 105.<br>
FIG. 4 is a block diagram of an apparatus for<br>
decoding an audio signal according to another embodiment of<br>
the present invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 4, an apparatus for decoding an<br>
audio signal according to another embodiment of the present<br>
invention includes the receiving unit .301, the<br>
15<br><br>
demultiplexing unit 401, a core decoding unit 403, a multi-<br>
channel generating unit 405, a spatial information decoding<br>
unit 407 and the extracting unit 303.<br>
The receiving unit 301 of the audio signal decoding<br>
apparatus receives an audio signal transferred in a<br>
bitstream form from an audio signal encoding apparatus via<br>
an input terminal IN2. And, the receiving unit 301 sends<br>
the received audio signal to the demultiplexing unit 401.<br>
The demultiplexing unit 401 separates the audio<br>
signal sent by the receiving unit 301 into an encoded<br>
downmix signal 103 and an encoded spatial information<br>
signal 105. The demultiplexing unit 401 transfers the<br>
encoded downmix signal 103 separated from a bitstream to<br>
the core decoding unit 403 and transfers the encoded<br>
spatial information signal 105 separated from the bitstream<br>
to the extracting unit 303.<br>
The encoded downmix signal 103 is decoded by the core<br>
decoding unit 403 and is then transferred to the multi-<br>
channel generating unit 405. The encoded spatial<br>
information signal 105 includes the header 201 and the<br>
spatial information 203.<br>
If the header 201 is included in the encoded spatial<br>
information signjil 105, the extracting unit 303 extracts<br>
the configuratior information 205 from the header 201. The<br>
16<br><br>
extracting unit 303 is able to discriminate a presence of<br>
the header 201 using the header identification information<br>
included in the audio signal. In particular, the header<br>
identification information may represent whether the header<br>
201 is included in a frame included in the spatial<br>
information signal 105. The header identification<br>
information may indicate an order of a frame or a bit<br>
sequence of the audio signal, in which the configuration<br>
information 205 extracted from the header 201 is included<br>
if the header 201 is included in the frame.<br>
In case of deciding that the header 201 is included<br>
in the frame via the header identification information, the<br>
extracting unit 303 extracts the configuration information<br>
205 from the header 201 included in the frame. The<br>
extracted configuration information 205 is then decoded.<br>
The spatial information decoding unit 407 decodes the<br>
spatial information 2 03 included in the frame according to<br>
decoded configuration information 205.<br>
And, the multi-channel generating unit 4 05 generates<br>
a multi-channel signal using the decoded downmix signal 103<br>
and decoded spatial information 203 and then outputs the<br>
generated multi-channel signal via an output terminal OUT2.<br>
FIG. 5 is a flowchart of a method of decoding an<br>
audio signal according to one embodiment of the present<br>
17<br><br>
invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 5, an audio signal decoding<br>
apparatus receives the spatial information signal 105<br>
transferred in a bitstream form by an audio signal encoding<br>
apparatus (S501).<br>
As mentioned in the foregoing description, the<br>
spatial information signal 105 can be categorized into a<br>
case of being transferred as an ES separated from the<br>
downmix signal 103 and a case of being transferred by being<br>
combined with the downmix signal 103.<br>
The demultiplexing unit 401 of an audio signal<br>
separates the received audio signal into the encoded<br>
downmix signal 103 and the encoded spatial information<br>
signal 105. The encoded spatial information signal 105<br>
includes the header 201 and the spatial information 203. If<br>
the header 201 is included in a frame of the spatial<br>
information signal 105, the audio signal decoding apparatus<br>
identifies the header 201 (S503).<br>
The audio signal decoding apparatus extracts the<br>
configuration information 205 from the header 201 (S505) .<br>
And, the audio signal decoding apparatus decodes the<br>
spatial information 203 using the extracted configuration<br>
information 205 (S507).<br>
FIG. 6 is a flowchart of a method of decoding an<br>
18<br><br>
audio signal according to another embodiment of the present<br>
invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 6, an audio signal decoding<br>
apparatus receives the spatial information signal 105<br>
transferred in a bitstream form by an audio signal encoding<br>
apparatus (S501) .<br>
As mentioned in the foregoing description, the<br>
spatial information signal 105 can be categorized into a<br>
case of being transferred as an ES separated from the<br>
downmix signal 103 and a case of being transferred by being<br>
included in ancillary data or extension data of the downmix<br>
signal 103.<br>
The demultiplexing unit 401 of an audio signal<br>
separates the received audio signal into the encoded<br>
downmix signal 103 and the encoded spatial information<br>
signal 105. The encoded spatial information signal 105<br>
includes the header 201 and the spatial information 203.<br>
The audio signal decoding apparatus decides whether the<br>
header 201 is included in a frame (S601).<br>
If the header 201 is included in the frame, the audio<br>
signal decoding apparatus identifies the header 201 (S503).<br>
The audio signal decoding apparatus then extracts the<br>
configuration information 205 from the header 201 (S505)'.<br>
The audio signal decoding apparatus decides whether<br>
19<br><br>
the configuration information 205 extracted from the header<br>
201 is the configuration information 205 extracted from a<br>
first header 201 included in the spatial information signal<br>
105 (S603) .<br>
If the configuration information 205 is extracted<br>
from the header 201 extracted first from the audio signal,<br>
the audio signal decoding apparatus decodes the<br>
configuration information 205 (S611) and decodes the<br>
spatial information 203 transferred behind the<br>
configuration information 205 according to the decoded<br>
configuration information 205.<br>
If the header 201 extracted from the audio signal is<br>
not the header 201 extracted first from the spatial<br>
information signal 105, the audio signal decoding apparatus<br>
decides whether the configuration information 205 extracted<br>
from the header 201 is identical to the configuration<br>
information 205 extracted from the first header 201 (S605).<br>
If the configuration information 205 is identical to<br>
the configuration information 205 extracted from the first<br>
header 201, the audio signal decoding apparatus decodes the<br>
spatial information 203 using the decoded configuration<br>
information 205 extracted from the first header 201.<br>
If the extracted configuration inform ition 205 is not<br>
identical to the configuration information 205 extracted<br>
20<br><br>
from the first header 201, the audio signal decoding<br>
apparatus decides whether an error occurs in the audio<br>
signal on a transfer path from the audio signal encoding<br>
apparatus to the audio signal decoding apparatus (S607).<br>
If the configuration information 205 is variable, the<br>
error does not occur even if the configuration information<br>
205 is not identical to the configuration information 205<br>
extracted from the first header 201. Hence, the audio<br>
signal decoding apparatus updates the header 201 into the<br>
new header 201 (S609). The audio signal decoding apparatus<br>
then decodes the configuration information 205 extracted<br>
from the updated header 201 (S611).<br>
The audio signal decoding apparatus decodes the<br>
spatial information 203 transferred behind the<br>
configuration information 205 according to the decoded<br>
configuration information 205.<br>
If the configuration information 205, which is<br>
invariable, is not identical to the configuration<br>
information 2 05 extracted from the first header 201, it<br>
means that the error occurs on the audio signal transfer<br>
path. Hence, the audio signal decoding apparatus removes<br>
the spatial information 203 included in the frame including<br>
the erroneous configuration information 205 or corrects the<br>
error of the spatial information 203 (S613) .<br>

FIG. 7 is a flowchart of a method of decoding an<br>
audio signal according to a further embodiment of the<br>
present invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 7, an audio signal decoding<br>
apparatus receives the spatial information signal 105<br>
transferred in a bitstream form by an audio signal encoding<br>
apparatus (S501).<br>
The demultiplexing unit 401 of an audio signal<br>
separates the received audio signal into the encoded<br>
downmix signal 103 and the encoded spatial information<br>
signal 105. In this case, the position information 207 of<br>
the time slot to which a parameter will be applied is<br>
included in the spatial information signal 105.<br>
The audio signal decoding apparatus extracts the<br>
position information 207 of the time slot from the spatial<br>
information 203 (S701).<br>
The audio signal decoding apparatus applies a<br>
parameter to the corresponding time slot by adjusting a<br>
position of the time slot, to which the parameter will be<br>
applied, using the extracted position information of the<br>
time slot (S703).<br>
FIG. 8 is a flowchart of a method of obtaining a<br>
position information representing quantity according to :&gt;ne<br>
embodiment of the present invention. A position information<br>
22<br><br>
representing quantity of a time slot is the number of bits<br>
allocated to represent the position information 207 of the<br>
time slot.<br>
The position information representing quantity of the<br>
time slot, to which a first parameter is applied, can be<br>
found by subtracting the number of parameters from the<br>
number of time slots, adding 1 to the subtraction result,<br>
taking a 2-base logarithm on the added value and applying a<br>
ceil function to the logarithm value. In particular, the<br>
position information representing quantity of the time slot,<br>
to which the first parameter will be applied, can be found<br>
by ceil (log2 (k-i+1) ) , where k' and *i' are the number of<br>
time slots and the number of parameters, respectively.<br>
Assuming that XN' is a natural number, the position<br>
information representing quantity of the time slot, to<br>
which an (N+l)th parameter will be applied, is represented<br>
as the position information 207 of the time slot to which<br>
an Nth parameter is applied. In this case, the position<br>
information 207 of the time slot, to which an Nth parameter<br>
is applied, can be found by adding the number of time slots<br>
existing between the time slot to which the Nth parameter<br>
is applied and a time slot to which an (N-l)th parameter is<br>
applied to the position information of the time slot to<br>
which the (N-l)th parameter is applied and adding 1 to the<br>
23<br><br>
added value (S801). In particular, the position information<br>
of the time slot to which the (N+l)th parameter will be<br>
applied can be found by j(N)+r(N+l)+1, where r(N+l)<br>
indicates the number of time slots existing between the<br>
time slot to which the (N+l)th parameter is applied and the<br>
time slot to which the Nth parameter is applied.<br>
If the position information 207 of the time slot to<br>
which the Nth parameter is applied is found, the time slot<br>
position information representing quantity representing the<br>
position of the time slot to which the (N+l)th parameter is<br>
applied can be obtained. In particular, the time slot<br>
position information representing quantity representing the<br>
position of the time slot to which the (N+l)th parameter is<br>
applied can be found by subtracting the number of<br>
parameters applied to a frame and the position information<br>
of the time slot to which the Nth parameter is applied from<br>
the number of time slots and adding (N+l) to the<br>
subtraction value (S803). In particular, the position<br>
information representing quantity of the time slot to which<br>
the (N+l)th parameter is applied can be found by<br>
ceil(log2(k-i+N+l-j (N) ) ) , where *k', *i' and Aj (N) ' are the<br>
number of time slots, the number of parameters and the<br>
position information 205 of the time slot to which an Nth<br>
parameter is applied, respectively.<br>
24<br><br>
In case of obtaining the position information<br>
representing quantity of the time slot in the above-<br>
explained manner, the position information representing<br>
quantity of the time slot to which the (N+l)th parameter is<br>
applied has the number of allocated bits inverse-<br>
proportional to *N'. Namely, the position information<br>
representing quantity of the time slot to which the<br>
parameter is applied is a variable value depending on *N'.<br>
FIG. 9 is a flowchart of a method of decoding an<br>
audio signal according to further embodiment of the present<br>
invention.<br>
An audio signal decoding apparatus receives an audio<br>
signal from an audio signal encoding apparatus (S901). The<br>
audio signal includes the audio descriptor 101, the downmix<br>
signal 103 and the spatial information signal 105.<br>
The audio signal decoding apparatus extracts the<br>
audio descriptor 101 included in the audio signal (S903).<br>
An identifier indicating an audio codec is included in the<br>
audio descriptor 101.<br>
The audio signal decoding apparatus recognizes that<br>
the audio signal includes the downmix signal 103 and the<br>
spatial information signal 105 using the audio descriptor<br>
101. In particular, the audio signal decoding apparatus is<br>
