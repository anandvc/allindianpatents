(Formula Removed)<br>
or 3-{3-[{[(7S)-3,4-dimethoxybicyclo[4.2.0]octa-l,3,5-trien-7-yl]methyl}(methyl)amino]-propyl}-7,8-dimethoxy-l,3,4,5-tetrahydro-2H-3-benzazepin-2-one,<br>

Ivabradine, and its addition salts with a pharmaceutically acceptable acid, and more especially its hydrochloride, have very valuable pharmacological and therapeutic properties, especially bradycardic properties, making those compounds useful in the treatment or prevention of various clinical situations of myocardial ischaemia such as angina pectoris, myocardial infarct and associated rhythm disturbances, and also in various pathologies involving rhythm disturbances, especially supraventricular rhythm disturbances, and in heart failure.<br>
The preparation and therapeutic use of ivabradine and its addition salts with a pharmaceutically acceptable acid, and more especially its hydrochloride, have been described in the European patent specification EP 0 534 859.<br>
