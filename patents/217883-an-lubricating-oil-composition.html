				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
This invention relates to organo molybdenum derivatives and their use as multifunctional modifier, antiwear, extreme pressure, antioxidant additives for lubricants.  The additives of the present invention are reaction products of mono- or poly-functional organic acids or esters and an aliphatic diamine that are further reacted with carbon disulfide and then with molybdenum compounds to form the final complex products.<br>
2.	Description of Related Art<br>
Regulatory agencies today are seeking to improve the fuel economy of motor vehicles through legislation (CAFE requirements) that puts the responsibility for achieving such economy on the motor vehicle manufacturers, who, in turn, transfer at least a portion of this responsibility to lubricant oil manufacturers by means of engine oil specifications.  As these fuel economy requirements become more and more rigorous, it becomes; more and more important to incorporate friction modifier additives into lubricant compositions.  Thus it is an object of the present invention to provide a friction modifier additive that imparts a reduction in the coefficient of friction of a lubricant composition.<br>
In addition, zinc dialkyldithiophosphates (ZDDP) have been used in formulated oils as antiwear and antioxidant additives for more than 50 years. However, zinc dialkyldithiophosphates give rise to ash, which contributes to particulate matter in automotive exhaust emissions.  Regulatory agencies are seeking<br>
to reduce emissions of zinc into the environment.  Moreover, the phosphorus present in the dialkyldithiophosphates is also suspected of limiting the service life of catalytic converters that are used on vehicles to reduce pollution.  It is important to limit the participate matter and pollution formed during engine use for toxicological and environmental reasons, but it is also important to maintain undiminished the antiwear and antioxidant properties of the lubricating oil.  In view of the aforementioned shortcomings with the known zinc- and phosphorus-containing additives, it is a further object of this invention to provide antiwear and antioxidant additives that contain neither zinc nor phosphorus.<br>
In developing lubricating oils, there have been many attempts to provide additives that impart antifrictional or oiliness properties.

The following is a list of representative ether polyamines commercially available from Toman Inc. that can be used to react with vegetable oil or other saturated or unsaturated esters or acids, and then treated with carbon disulfide and molybdenum compounds to form the products of the present invention: DA-1214 (Octyl/decyloxypropyl-l ,3-diaminopropane), DA-14 (Isodecyloxypropyl-l,3-diaminopropane), DA-16 (Isododecyloxypropyl-1,3-diaminopropane),<br>
DA-1618 (Dodecyl/tetradecyloxypropyl-1,3 diaminopropane), DA-17 (Isotridecyloxypropyl-l,3-diaminopropane), and DA-18 (Tetradecyloxypropyl-1,3~diaminopropane).<br>
The following is a partial list of polyamines commercially available from Akzo Nobel Chemicals Inc. that can also be used to react with vegetable oil or other saturated or unsarurated esters or acids, and then treated with carbon disulfide and molybdenum compounds to form the products of the present invention: Duomeen C (N-coco-l,3-diaminopropanes), Duomeen T (N-tailow-l,3-diaminopropanes), and Duomeen OL (N-oleyl-l,3-diaminopropane).<br>
In the practice of the present invention, it is preferred that the diamine be used in a concentration of from about 10 weight percent to about 70 weight percent.<br>
The suitable sulfur compound to react with the intermediate diamine and ester or acid reaction product is carbon disulfide.<br>
Suitable molybdenum compounds useful in the practice of the present invention include molybdic acid, ammonium molybdate, and molybdenum salts such as MoOCl4, MoO2Br2, MoO3Cl6, and MoO3. The preferred molybdenum compound is molybdenum trioxide. It is preferred in the practice of the present invention that the molybdenum compound be used in a concentration of about 0.01 to about 15 weight percent.<br>
The process for making the molybdenum-based friction modifiers of the present invention can, if desired, be carried out in a single reaction vessel and requires no solvent, isolation of intermediate products, or removal of reaction solvent<br>
or reaction by-products (Examples 13 through 19).  It results in a clear liquid product<br>
with a very desirable color, which is light yellow to orange at the typical 1.0 weight percent dosage levels used in petroleum and synthetic lubricant base oils.  Most other commercial molybdenum friction modifiers impart undesirable green, blue, and purple colors to finished fully formulated crank case motor oils.<br>
The process is initiated by charging the reactor, under a nitrogen blanket, with the starting vegetable oil.  Typical glyceride vegetable oils used are based on C12 to C22 fatty acids, both saturated and unsaturated.  These vegetable oils can be, for example, canola (rapeseed), corn, soya, peanut, sunflower, cottonseed, olive, safflower, or coconut oils.  Mixtures of these or similar oils can also be used.  Next a diamine is charged.   In the diamine, one amine group must be a primary amine and the other amine group must be a secondary amine.  The amine groups are separated by a branched or linear C1 to C10 aliphatic or aromatic moiety.  The mole ratio of the diamine to the vegetable oil, is typically in the range of 0.5 to 2.0.  This reaction medium is heated to a temperature in the range of 110° to 150°C for three to ten hours depending on the reactivity of the diamine to form a reaction intermediate, which, where vegetable oil is used, is a mixture of fatty acid amide and the mono and/or diacid glycerides. The reaction medium is then cooled to room temperature, whereupon carbon disulfide is added slowly under a nitrogen blanket.  The reaction medium will exotherm.  Molybdenum trioxide is then added to the reaction medium. The reaction temperature is raised to 80° to 105°C for 30 to 60 minutes, then to 135°C for one to six hours under a nitrogen blanket.  The reaction product is cooled to 60° to 90°C and filtered (if needed) through a bed of Celite filter aid. Alternatively, the product can be diluted with a hydrocarbon solvent and filtered, after which the solvent is removed under vacuum.  The final product is a dark,<br>
reddish brown liquid that imparts a light yellow to orange color to a petroleum base oil at 1.0 to 1.5 weight percent dosage levels. The molybdenum incorporated in the product can range from 2 to 8 weight percent.<br>
The additives of the present invention can be used in combination with other additives typically found in lubricating oil, as well as with other friction modifier additives.  Typical additives found in lubricating oils are dispersants, detergents, corrosion/rust inhibitors, antioxidants, e.g., secondary amine antioxidants, hindered phenolic antioxidants, sulfur-containing hindered phenolic antioxidants, sulfurized olefins, thiadiazoles, antiwear agents, e.g., zinc dialkyldithiophosphates, antifoamants, friction modifiers, seal swell agents, demulsifiers, VI improvers, and pour point depressants.  See, for example, U.S. Patent No. 5,498,809 for a description of useful lubricating oil composition additives.  Examples of dispersants include polyisobutylene succinimides, polyisobutylene succinate esters, Mannich Base ashless dispersants, and the like.  Examples of detergents include metallic phenates, metallic sulfonates, metallic salicylates, and the like.  Examples of antioxidant additives that can be used in combination with the additives of the present invention include alkylated diphenylamines, N-alkylated phenylenediamines, hindered phenolics, alkylated hydroquinones, hydroxylated thiodiphenyl ethers, alkylidenebisphenols, oil soluble copper compounds, and the like.  Examples of antiwear additives that can be used in combination with the additives of the present invention include organo borates, organo phosphites, organic sulfur-containing compounds, zinc dialkyl dithiophosphates, zinc diaryl dithiophosphates, phosphosulfurized hydrocarbon, and the like.  Examples of friction modifiers that can be used in combination with the friction modifiers of the present invention include<br>
fatty acid esters and amides, organo molybdenum compounds, molybdenum dialkylthiocarbamates, molybdenum dialkyl dithiophosphates, and the like.  An example of an antifoamant is polysiloxane, and the like.  An example of a rust inhibitor is polyoxyalkylene polyols, and the like.  Examples of VI improvers include olefin copolymers and dispersant olefin copolymers, and the like.  An example of a pour point depressant is poly(methyl methacrylate), and the like.<br>
Compositions, when containing these additives, typically are blended into the base oil in amounts that are effective to provide their normal attendant function. Representative effective amounts of such additives are illustrated as follows:<br>

When other additives are employed, it may be desirable, although not necessary, to prepare additive concentrates comprising concentrated solutions or dispersions of the subject additives of this invention (in concentrate amounts hereinabove described), together with one or more of the other additives (the concentrate when constituting an additive mixture being referred to herein as an additive-package) whereby several additives can be added simultaneously to the base oil to form the lubricating oil composition.  Dissolution of the additive concentrate<br>
into the lubricating oil can be facilitated by solvents and by mixing accompanied by mild heating, but this is not essential.  The concentrate or additive-package will typically be formulated to contain the additives in proper amounts to provide the desired concentration in the final formulation when the additive-package is combined with a predetermined amount of base lubricant.  Thus, the subject additives of the present invention can be added to small amounts of base oil or other compatible solvents along with other desirable additives to form additive-packages containing active ingredients in collective amounts of typically from about 2.5 to about 90 percent, and preferably from about 15 to about 75 percent, and most preferably from about 25 to about 60 percent by weight additives in the appropriate proportions with the remainder being base oil.  The final formulations can employ typically about 1 to 20 weight percent of the additive-package with the remainder being base oil.<br>
All of the weight percentages expressed herein (unless otherwise indicated) are based on active ingredient (AI) content of the additive, and/or upon the total weight of any additive-package or formulation, which will be the sum of the AI weight of each additive plus the weight of total oil or diluent.<br>
In general, the lubricant compositions of the present invention contain the additives in a concentration ranging from about 0.05 to about 30 weight percent^, A concentration range for the additives ranging from about 0.1 to about 10 weight percent based on the total weight of the oil composition is preferred.  A preferred concentration range is from about 0.2 to about 5 weight percent.  Oil concentrates of the additives can contain from about 1 to about 75 weight percent of the additive reaction product in a carrier or diluent oil of lubricating oil viscosity.<br>
In general, the additives of the present invention are useful in a variety of lubricating oil basestocks.  The lubricating oil basestock is any natural or synthetic lubricating base oil stock fraction having a kinematic viscosity at 100°C of about 2 to about 200 cSt, more preferably about 3 to about 150 cSt, most preferably about 3 to about 100 cSt.  The lubricating oil basestock can be derived from natural lubricating oils, synthetic lubricating oils, or mixtures (hereof.  Suitable lubricating oil basestocks include basestocks obtained by isomerization of synthetic wax and wax, as well as hydrocrackate basestocks produced by hydrocracking (rather than solvent extracting) the aromatic and polar components of the crude.  Natural lubricating oils include animal oils, vegetable oils (e.g., rapeseed oils, castor oils, and lard oil), petroleum oils, mineral oils, and oils derived from coal or shale.<br>
Synthetic oils include hydrocarbon oils and halo-substituted hydrocarbon oils, such as polymerized and interpolymerized olefins, alkylbenzenes, polyphenyls, alkylated diphenyl ethers, alkylated diphenyl sulfides, as well as their derivatives, analogs, and homologs, and the like.  Synthetic lubricating oils also include alkylene oxide polymers, interpolymers, copolymers, and derivatives thereof wherein the terminal hydroxyl groups have been modified by esterification, etherification, etc. Another suitable class of synthetic lubricating oils comprises the esters of dicarboxylic acids with a variety of alcohols.  Esters useful as synthetic oils also include those made from C5 to C12 monocarboxylic acids and polyols and polyol ethers.<br>
Silicon-based oils (such as the polyalkyl-, polyaryl-, polyalkoxy-, or polyaryloxy-siloxane oils and silicate oils) comprise another useful class of synthetic<br>
process.  The resulting isomerate product is typically subjected to solvent dewaxing<br>
lubricating oils.  Other synthetic lubricating oils include liquid esters of phosphorus-containing acids, polymeric tetrahydrofurans, polyalphaolefins, and the like.<br>
The lubricating oil can be derived from unrefined, refined, redefined oils, or mixtures thereof.   Unrefined oils are obtained directly from a natural source or synthetic source (e.g., coal shale, or tar and bitumen) without further purification or treatment.  Examples of unrefined oils include a shale oil obtained directly from a retorting operation, a petroleum oil obtained directly from distillation, or an ester oil obtained directly from an esterification process, each of which is then used without further treatment.  Refined oils are similar to the unrefined oils except that refined oils have been treated in one or more purification steps to improve one or more properties.  Suitable purification techniques include distillation, hydrotreating, dewaxing, solvent extraction, acid or base extraction, filtration, and percolation, all of which are known to those skilled in the ail.  Rerefined oils are obtained by treating refined oils in processes similar to those used to obtain the refined oils.  These rerefined oils are also known as reclaimed or reprocessed oils and often are additionally processed by techniques for removal of spent additives and oil breakdown products.<br>
Lubricating oil base stocks derived from the hydroisomerization of wax can also be used, either alone or in combination with the aforesaid natural and/or synthetic base stocks.  Such wax isomerate oil is produced by the hydroisomerization of natural or synthetic waxes or mixtures thereof over a hydroisomerization catalyst. Natural waxes are typically the slack waxes recovered by the solvent dewaxing of mineral oils; synthetic waxes are typically the wax produced by the Fisher-Tropsch process.   The resulting isomerate product is typically subjected to solvent dewaxing<br>
and fractionation to recover various fractions of specific viscosity range.  Wax isomerate is also characterized by processing very high viscosity indices, generally having a VI of at least 130, preferably at least 135 and higher, and, following dewaxing, a pour point of about -20°C and higher.<br>
The additives of the present invention are especially useful as components in many different lubricating oil compositions. The additives can be included in a variety of oils with lubricating viscosity, including natural and synthetic lubricating oils and mixtures thereof.  The additives can be included in crankcase lubricating oils for spark-ignited and compression-ignited internal combustion engines.  The compositions can a]so be used in gas engine lubricants, turbine lubricants, automatic transmission fluids, gear lubricants, compressor lubricants, metal-working lubricants, hydraulic fluids, and other lubricating oil and grease-compositions.The additives can<br>
also be used in motor fuel compositions.<br>
A lubricating composition produced by the process of the present invention is neither a product of chemical reaction nor a product obtained by mere admixture resulting only in the aggregation of properties of the components thereof and is in fact a synergistic mixture having improved and unexpected properties.<br>

Cameron-Plint TE77 High Frequency Friction Machine Friction Coefficient Testing<br>
The antifriction properties of the novel reaction product in a fully formulated lubricating oil were determined in the Cameron Flint TE77 Friction Test.  The fully formulated lubricating oils tested contained one weight percent of the additive to be tested.  The additives were tested for effectiveness in a motor oil at increasing temperature points and compared to identical formulations with and without the friction.  In Table 1, the numerical value of the test results (Coefficient of Friction) decreases with an increase in effectiveness.  In other words, the lower the friction coefficient value, the better the additive is at reducing friction.<br>
The test procedure for determining the friction coefficient with the Cameron-Plint TE77 High Frequency Friction Machine is as follows.   10 ml of an oil sample containing the additive is placed in the test chamber so as to cover a flat, stationary, hardened ground NSOH B01 Gauge Plate (RC 60/0.4 micron).  A reciprocating specimen, a 16 mm long nitrided steel dowel pin (6 mm diameter, 60 Re) is placed on top of the steel plate under a 50 Newton load, allowed to heat up to 35°C from room temperature over 10 minutes, and maintained at 35°C for five minutes. Then, with the 50 Newton load in place, the reciprocation frequency of 5 Hertz is begun with a 15 millimeter amplitude stroke length.  The temperature is then ramped up to 50°C over 10 minutes and maintained at 50°C for five minutes.  The load is then increased to 100 Newtons, and the temperature is ramped up to 165°C over one hour.  Friction Coefficient data is collected between 60 to 160°C. The flat specimen is cleaned between runs with hexanes and #500 emery cloth.  A new dowel pin or surface of the<br>
dowel pin is used each time.  A reference oil is run alternately between experimental oils.  The same flat specimen is used until the reference oil no longer provides reproducible results.<br>
The motor oil formulation tested is an SAE 10W-30 grade containing dispersant, detergent, antioxidant, rust inhibitor, pour point depressant, OCP VI improver, and antiwear additive.  Friction modifier was added as a top treat to this formula.<br>

Falex Four-Ball Antiwear Testing<br>
The antiwear properties of the novel reaction product in a fully formulated lubricating oil were determined in the Four-Ball Wear Test under the ASTM D 4172 test conditions.  The fully formulated lubricating oils tested also contained one weight percent cumene hydroperoxide to help simulate the environment within a running engine.  The additives were tested for effectiveness in two motor oil formulations (See description in Table 2) and compared to identical formulations with and without any zinc dialkyldithiophosphate. In Table 3, the numerical value of the test results (Average Wear Scar Diameter, mm) decreases with an increase in effectiveness.<br>
Table 2:  SAE 10W-30 Motor Oil Formulations<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
1 In the case of No antiwear additive in Table 3, solvent neutral 100 is put in its place at 1.0 weight percent. The formulation is treated so that 1 weight percent antiwear additive is based upon 100 percent active material.  For the examples in Tables 3 and 4 with zinc dialkyldithiophosphate (ZDDP), the ZDDP is the antiwear additive in these cases.<br>

Cameron-Plint TE77 High Frequency Friction Machine Antiwear Testing<br>
The antiwear properties of the additives of this invention in a fully formulated lubricating oil were determined in the Four-Ball Wear test under the ASTM D 4172 test conditions.  The specimen parts (6 mm diameter AJSI 52100 steel ball of 800<br>
±20 kg/mm2 hardness and hardened ground NSOH B01 gauge plate of RC 60/0.4 micron) were rinsed and then sonicated for 15 minutes with technical grade hexanes. This procedure is repeated with isopropyl alcohol.  The specimens were dried with nitrogen and set into the TE77.  The oil bath was filled with 10 ml of sample.  The test was run at a 30 Hertz Frequency, 100 Newton Load, 2.35 mm Amplitude.  The test started with the specimens and oil at room temperature.  Immediately, the temperature was ramped over 15 minutes to 50°C, where it dwelled for 15 minutes. The temperature was then ramped over 15 minutes to 100°C, where it dwelled at 100°C for 45 minutes. A third temperature ramp over 15 minutes to 150°C was followed by a final dwell at 150°C for 15 minutes.  The total length of the test was two hours.  At the end of the test, the wear scar diameter on the 6 mm ball was measured using a Leica StereoZoom6® Stereomicroscope and a Mitutoyo 164 series Digimatic Head.   The fully formulated lubricating oils tested contained one weight percent cumene hydroperoxide to help simulate the environment within a running engine.  The additives were tested for effectiveness in two motor oil formulations (see formulation descriptions in Table 2) and compared to identical formulations with and without any zinc dialkyldithiophosphate.  In Table 4, the numerical value of the test results (Wear Scar Diameter, mm) decreases with an increase in effectiveness.<br>

Four-Ball Extreme Pressure Testing<br>
The extreme pressure (EP) properties of the additives of this invention in a lubricating oil were determined in the Four-Ball Weld Test under the ASTM D 2783 test conditions.  The additives were blended into an ISO 46 Grade Group II base oil<br>
(Chevron RLOP 240 R) at the weight percents cited in Table 5.  The higher the Load Wear Index and the higher the Weld Point, the better the result.<br>

Pressure Differential Scanning Calorimetry (PDSC) Testing<br>
The Pressure Differential Scanning Calorimetry (PDSC) data in Table 7 are a measure of the oxidation induction time (OIT) of each blend.  The PDSC conditions are in Table 6.  All formulations were blended at 65 °C for 15 minutes under a nitrogen atmosphere.  The PDSC method employs a steel bomb under pressure, the catalyst is oil-soluble iron derived from iron napththanate.  At the start of a run, the PDSC cell is initially heated at a rate of 40°C/min to the isothermal temperature listed in each results table.  The induction time is measured from the time the sample reaches its isothermal temperature until the enthalpy change is observed. The longer the oxidation induction time, the better the oxidation stability of the oil.  The PSDC instrument used is a Mettler DSC27HP manufactured by Mettler-Toledo, Inc. The test has a repeatability of ±2.5 minutes with 95 percent confidence for OIT's less than 100 min.  Each data point is the average of two runs on a single test blend.<br>
The results in Table 7 demonstrate the unexpected stability imparted to the oil compositions by the addition of the molybdenum thiocarbamyl derivatives of this invention, particularly in combination with ZDDP and alkylated diphenylamine antioxidants.<br>
