CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
This application claims the benefit of U S Provisional Application No 60/984,592, filed<br>
on Nov 1, 2007 The disclosure of the above application is incorporated herein by<br>
reference in its entirety<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present disclosure relates to vehicles including a post oxygen performance<br>
diagnostic system<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The statements in this section merely provide background information related to the<br>
present disclosure and may not constitute prior art.<br>
During the combustion process, gasoline is oxidized and hydrogen (H) and carbon (C)<br>
combine with air Various chemical compounds are formed including carbon dioxide<br>
(CO2), water (H2O), carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxides (NOx),unbumed<br>
hydrocarbons (HC), sulfur oxides (SO2), and other compounds<br>
Automobile exhaust systems include a catalytic converter that reduces exhaust<br>
emissions by chemically converting the exhaust gas into carbon dioxide (CO2),<br>
nitrogen (N), and water (H2O). Exhaust gas oxygen sensors generate signals<br>
indicating the oxygen content of the exhaust gas An inlet or<br><br>
Indicating the oxygen content of the exhaust gas An inlet or pre-catalyst oxygen<br>
sensor monitors the oxygen level associated with the inlet exhaust stream of the<br>
catalytic converter. This inlet O2 sensor is also the primary feedback mechanism that<br>
maintains the air-to-fuel (A/F) ratio of the engine at the chemically correct or<br>
stoichiometric A/F ratio that is needed to support the catalytic conversion processes.<br>
An outlet or post-catalyst oxygen sensor monitors the oxygen level associated with an<br>
outlet exhaust stream of the catalytic converter. The post-02 sensor signal is used for<br>
secondary A/F ratio control<br>
Engine diagnostic systems require properly functioning oxygen sensors Therefore,<br>
the oxygen sensors are periodically checked to ensure proper function Traditionally,<br>
the diagnostic systems employ intrusive checks to check the operation of the sensors.<br>
During the intrusive checks, the A/F ratio may be manipulated and the sensor<br>
response is monitored. However, these intrusive checks may increase exhaust<br>
emissions and/or cause engine instability and reduced drivability that may be<br>
noticeable to a vehicle operator<br>
During some operating conditions, an engine control system may cutoff fuel to the<br>
engine during deceleration. This technique is often referred to as deceleration fuel<br>
cutoff (DFCO) Some diagnostic systems evaluate operation of the post-catalyst<br>
oxygen sensor during DFCO<br>
DE 97222334 discloses an exhaust gas probe diagnosis method for Internal<br>
combustion engine. According to the invention, the probe is arranged downstream of<br>
a catalyst converter, and is sensitive to one or more exhaust constituents. The rate at<br>
which the signal from the probe reacts when the concentration of the constituent is<br>
changed, is used as a judgement criterion for diagnosing the probe performance. The<br><br>
probe may be an oxygen-sensitive probe with Nernst characteristics. The reaction of<br>
the probe to changes in the oxygen content of the exhaust gas is evaluated after the<br>
start of shifting phase with fuel switch-off. Faults in the probe are displayed or stored.<br>
US 2002/0134596 discloses a controller of a hybrid vehicle. According to the<br>
invention, in fuel cut control during vehicle deceleration at an engine side, a return<br>
engine speed is set at a speed in which the engine inevitably stalls. However, at<br>
motor side, assist-control is executed such that engine speed is maintained so that<br>
engine stall does not occur, and so that engine speed smoothly converges at an idle<br>
speed. Thus, the engine speed is set at a lower value, so that fuel cut is executed as<br>
long as possible to improve fuel consumption.<br>
OBJECT OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is therefore an object of the invention to propose a post oxygen performance<br>
diagnostic system and method to restrict exhaust emission and increase engine<br>
stability and drivability to a vehicle operator.<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
A system comprises a post oxygen performance diagnostic (POPD) module that<br>
performs a POPD of a post oxygen sensor, wherein the POPD includes a deceleration<br>
fuel cutoff (DFCO) portion A torque converter control module adjusts operation of a<br>
torque converter clutch (TCC). The POPD module and the torque converter control<br>
module operate the TCC to control engine speed above a predetermined engine<br>
speed during the DFCO portion of the POPD<br>
A method comprises performing a POPD of a post oxygen sensor, wherein the POPD<br>
includes a deceleration fuel cutoff (DFCO) portion, and adjusting operation of a torque<br>
converter clutch (TCC) to control engine speed above a predetermined engine speed<br>
during the DFCO portion of the POPD<br>
Further areas of applicability will become apparent from the description provided<br>
herein It should be understood that the description and specific examples are<br>
intended for purposes of illustration only and are not intended to limit the scope of the<br>
present disclosure.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
The drawings described herein are for illustration purposes only and are not intended<br>
to limit the scope of the present disclosure in any way<br>
FIG. 1 is a functional block diagram of an engine control system according to the<br>
present disclosure, and<br>
FIG 2 is a flowchart illustrating exemplary operation of the control module of FIG 1<br><br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The following description is merely exemplary in nature and is not intended to limit the<br>
present disclosure, application, or uses It should be understood that throughout the<br>
drawings, corresponding reference numerals indicate like or corresponding parts and<br>
features<br>
As used herein, the term module refers to an application specific integrated circuit<br>
(ASIC), an electronic circuit, a processor (shared, dedicated, or group) and memory<br>
that execute one or more software or firmware programs, a combinational logic circuit,<br>
and/or other suitable components that provide the described functionality.<br>
Referring now to FIG 1, an engine system 10 includes an engine 12, an exhaust<br>
system 14 and a control module 16 Air is drawn into the engine 12 through a throttle<br>
17 and an intake manifold 18, and is mixed with fuel in the engine 12 The air and fuel<br>
mixture is combusted within cylinders (not shown) to generate drive torque The gases<br>
produced via combustion exit the engine through an exhaust manifold 19 and the<br>
exhaust system 14. The exhaust system 14 includes a catalytic converter 22, a pre-<br>
catalyst or inlet oxygen sensor 24, hereinafter pre-O2 sensor 24 and a post-catalyst<br>
oxygen sensor 26, herein after post-02 sensor 26 The exhaust gases are treated<br>
within the catalytic converter 22 and are exhausted to atmosphere<br>
The pre-02 sensor 24 and the post-02 sensor 26 generate respective signals that are<br>
communicated to the control module 16 The pre-02 and post-02 sensor signals<br><br>
indicate the oxygen content of the exhaust entering and exiting the catalytic converter<br>
22, respectively The control module 16 communicates with a fuel system to regulate<br>
fuel flow to the engine 12 based on the sensor signals An output of the engine 12 is<br>
input to a torque converter (TC) 40 having a torque converter clutch (TCC) 44. An<br>
output of the TC 40 is input to a transmission 50<br>
The control module 16 may include a post oxygen performance diagnostic (POPD)<br>
module 52 that performs a POPD The POPD may include a deceleration fuel cutoff<br>
(DFCO) portion The control module 16 may also include a torque converter control<br>
module 54 that controls operation of a torque converter clutch (TCC)<br>
As can be appreciated, the engine system 10 may include a wide variety of sensors<br>
that provide inputs to the control module 16 Furthermore, one or more accessories,<br>
actuators or other devices may receive control signals from the control module 16<br>
Furthermore, the control module 16 may be implemented using an engine control<br>
module, an engine control module and a transmission control module, or using other<br>
arrangements The control module 16 may optionally perform electronic throttle<br>
control Still other variations are contemplated<br>
The present disclosure allows the engine system 10 to maintain engine speed during<br>
a deceleration fuel cutoff (DFCO) portion of a post oxygen performance diagnostic<br>
(POPD) system During DFCO, some vehicles release the TCC 44. Without engine<br>
braking, the engine speed will quickly decrease to idle speed. As a result of the<br>
reduced engine speed, the control module 16 may disable the POPD system before<br>
completion due to the reduced engine speed For example, the POPD system may<br>
require engine speeds greater than 800 revolutions per minute (RPM)<br><br>
The engine system 10 according to the present disclosure maintains the TCC 44 in a<br>
controlled slip state or a lock state during DFCO, which causes the engine 12 to be in<br>
an engine braking condition As a result of the engine braking, the engine 12 will have<br>
a higher engine speed during DFCO Therefore, the control module 16 will be able to<br>
complete the POPD during DFCO The TCC Module 44 decides the appropriate action<br>
(lock state, controlled slip state or ignore POPD request) based on ability for POPD to<br>
complete, dnveability and transmission hardware limitations One means by which the<br>
TCC control can respond to the POPD assistance request, is to maintain powertrain<br>
dnvehne coupling, by locking the TCC or maintaining the TCC in a controlled slip<br>
condition<br>
As can be appreciated, the dynamics that are involved are different for each<br>
transmission design, and hence some development work may be required to<br>
determine the specific actions for each application. The control module may honor the<br>
request except when this would conflict with hardware protection and/or durability,<br>
transmission diagnostic actions, torque security actions, engine stalling concerns,<br>
minimum transmission pump speed criteria or otherwise cause customer<br>
dissatisfaction due to noise, vibration and harshness (NVH) problems. Still other<br>
criteria may be used.<br>
While the engine speed may stay high enough during DFCO to complete the POPD<br>
when the vehicle is travelling greater than 55 mph, test vehicles do not typically travel<br>
at this speed during current emissions testing procedures. As a result, the POPD test<br>
may not complete during emissions testing, which may pose problems for certification.<br><br>
The control module 16 commands the TCC 44 to either a locked state or a controlled<br>
slip state to maintain the engine speed and prevent a rapid decrease in engine speed<br>
during a DFCO portion of the POPD test As a result, the engine 12 remains<br>
mechanically linked to the drive wheels allowing the momentum of the vehicle to<br>
maintain a higher engine speed, which allows more time/airflow to complete the*POPD<br>
diagnostic<br>
The POPD test was developed to meet the requirements for emissions systems using<br>
the post-02 sensor 26 for diagnosis of the catalytic converter 22 Vehicles using this<br>
approach need to test the post O2 26 Furthermore, the diagnostic system may also<br>
measure the performance of the post-02 sensor 26 in a forced rich condition and a<br>
lean condition<br>
The POPD test may be enabled when the engine is in proper conditions for a DFCO<br>
Further operating conditions include a minimum engine speed, minimum vehicle<br>
speed, and/or other conditions If the monitored conditions fall outside under these<br>
conditions, the POPD will disable and abort the test<br>
When the POPD test is enabled, the POPD test may command the engine control<br>
system to a DFCO inhibit state for a predetermined period This prevents normal<br>
DFCO from occurring before the POPD is ready for the DFCO portion of the POPD<br>
test At the start of the predetermined period, the control module may command the<br>
TCC 44 into a fully locked state In the fully locked state, the engine 12 is fully coupled<br>
to the transmission 50 The TCC 44 remains in the fully locked state for a sufficient<br>
amount of time to allow the POPD test to complete or the DFCO portion of the POPD<br>
test to complete<br><br>
Alternately, the control module commands a controlled slip of the TCC 44 at the start<br>
of the predetermined period instead of fully locking the TCC 44 The controlled TCC<br>
slip allows the engine speed to be elevated over an increased window of operation to<br>
allow the POPD test a sufficient amount of time to complete or the DFCO portion of<br>
the POPD test to complete<br>
Alternately, if TCC control features are not available (driveability concerns and/or<br>
transmission hardware limitations), the TCC control actions related to the POPD<br>
request may be ignored The POPD will then continue to send the request until it<br>
completes the DFCO portion of the POPD test Once the DFCO is complete, the<br>
POPD ends the TCC request mode From this point, the POPD test does not depend<br>
upon engine speed or vehicle speed<br>
Engine speed will decrease more slowly during the DFCO portion of the POPD test as<br>
a result of the present disclosure For example, the engine speed may decrease less<br>
during the DFCO portion of the POPD test with the TCC 44 at full lock as compared to<br>
normal control. In other words, without using the control of the present invention, the<br>
engine speed may decelerate to a disable speed condition such as 800 RPM before<br>
completing the DFCO portion of the POPD test.<br>
Referring now to FIG 2, steps of a method for controlling the TCC during the DFCO<br>
portion of the POPD test are shown Control begins with step 100 and continues with<br>
step 104 If step 104 is true, control continues with step 104 and determines whether<br>
the POPD test has been initiated In step 108, control temporarily inhibits DFCO. In<br>
step 111, control determines whether TCC control features are available (for example<br><br>
only, the features may be temporarily or permanently unavailable due to dnveability<br>
concerns and/or transmission hardware limitations) If step 111 is false, the POPD will<br>
then continue with step 113 and attempt to perform the DFCO portion of the POPD<br>
test If the test completes as determined in step 114, control ends in step- 124<br>
However, completion is less likely in this mode for reasons described above.<br>
If step 111 is true and the TCC control features are available, control continues with<br>
step 112. In step 112, control commands the TCC 44 to a locked state or a partial slip<br>
state or disables control of the TCC 44 In step 116, control performs the DFCO portion<br>
of the POPD test In step 120, control ends the locked state when the DFCO portion is<br>
done At this point, control finishes the POPD test and control ends in step 124<br><br>
