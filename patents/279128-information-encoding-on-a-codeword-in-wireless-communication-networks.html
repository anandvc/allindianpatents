				<td>INFORMATION ENCODING ON A CODEWORD<br>
IN WIRELESS COMMUNICATION NETWORKS<br>
FIELD OF THE DISCLOSURE<br>
[0001]	The present disclosure relates generally to wireless<br>
communication, and more particularly to encoding additional information<br>
onto a portion of a codeword formed by encoding information with an error<br>
correcting code, for example, a cyclic redundancy code, for communication<br>
among entities in wireless communication networks, corresponding entities<br>
and methods.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0002]	Low latency is necessary to provide a positive user experience<br>
for Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP), Push-to-transmit over Cellular<br>
(PoC) and videophone application based services. According to the<br>
International Telecommunications Union (ITU), an intra-regional, e.g.,<br>
within Africa, Europe, North America, etc, VoIP call should experience<br>
single direction latency on the order of 150 msec, and an inter-regional VoIP<br>
call should experience single direction latency on the order of 200-300 msec.<br>
[0003]	Hybrid Automatic Repeat reQuest (HARQ) is known generally.<br>
EGPRS currently existing within GSM enables HARQ by periodic polling.<br>
The polling mechanism, however, is a fundamental cause of latency. In<br>
section 10 of the GERAN Evolution Feasibility Study 45.912, ACK/NACK<br>
messages are enabled either through polling and/or continuous bi-<br>
directional data flow. Thus where there is no continuous bi-directional data<br>
 <br>
flow, low latency can only be guaranteed by continuous polling. This is<br>
spectrally inefficient and does not allow seamless interoperability with<br>
legacy mobile stations. Currently, wireless communication network<br>
operators must disable HARQ completely or operate HARQ in a spectrally<br>
inefficient manner to support low latency applications such as voice over IP<br>
or real time video streaming.<br>
[0004]	For a mobile to mobile VoIP call, existing EGPRS protocols with<br>
Automatic Repeat Request (ARQ) have latency on the order of 420 msec for<br>
each up or down link. This latency exceeds the 200-300 msec latency for an<br>
inter-regional VoIP call and is well beyond the 150 msec latency for an intra-<br>
regional VoIP call.<br>
[0005]	The various aspects, features and advantages of the disclosure<br>
will become more fully apparent to those having ordinary skill in the art<br>
upon careful consideration of the following Detailed Description and the<br>
accompanying drawings described below. The drawings may have been<br>
simplified for clarity and are not necessarily drawn to scale.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
[0006]	FIG. 1 is a wireless communication network.<br>
[0007]	FIG. 2 is a wireless communication network infrastructure<br>
entity.<br>
 <br>
[0008]	FIG. 3 is a mobile wireless communication terminal.<br>
[0009]	FIG. 4 illustrates a wireless communication entity.<br>
[0010]	FIG. 5 is a process flow diagram.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0011]	In FIG. 1, the exemplary wireless communication system 100<br>
comprises one or more radio access networks 110 communicably coupled to<br>
a core network 120. Exemplary cellular communication networks include<br>
3GPP GERAN based networks, for example, GSM/EGPRS and Enhanced<br>
Data-rates for GSM (or Global) Evolution (EDGE) networks, and 3rd<br>
Generation 3GPP WCDMA networks among other existing and future<br>
generation cellular communication networks.<br>
[0012]	In FIG. 1, the access network generally comprises multiple base<br>
stations 112 serving cellular areas distributed over corresponding<br>
geographical regions, wherein each base station may consist of one or more<br>
cells or sectors. Generally, one or more base stations are communicably<br>
coupled to a corresponding controller 114. The base stations and controllers<br>
may be referred to differently depending upon the network protocol<br>
implemented. For example, in GSM networks, the base station 110 is<br>
referred to as a base transceiver station (BTS) and the controller is a Base<br>
Station Controller (BSC). Some GSM networks also include a Packet<br>
 <br>
Control Unit (PCU) 116. In UMTS networks, the base station is referred to<br>
as a Node Band the controller as a Radio Network Controller (RNC).<br>
[0013]	In FIG. 1, the core network 120 comprises a mobile switching<br>
center (MSC) 122 communicably coupled to the controller, for example, the<br>
BSC and RNC. The MSC is typically communicably coupled to a Public<br>
Switches telephone Network (PSTN) and/ or an Integrated Services Digital<br>
Network (ISDN), which is a PSTN utilizing Signaling System Number 7<br>
(SS7) interfaces (common channel telecommunications packet switching).<br>
The core network includes a Home Location Register (HLR) 124 and a<br>
Visitor Location Register (VLR), which may be located in the MSC or in<br>
some other infrastructure entity. In networks with packet service, the core<br>
network includes a Serving General packet radio support Serving Node<br>
(SGSN) 126 communicably coupled to the PCU 116 and/or the RNC 114. In<br>
GSM networks, the PCU provides packet support. The SGSN is typically<br>
communicably coupled to a Gateway GPRS Support node (GGSN) 128,<br>
which connects to other packet data networks, for example, the Internet.<br>
[0014]	The base stations communicate with mobile terminals 102,<br>
which may be referred to as Mobile Stations (MS) or User Equipment (UE),<br>
dependent upon the protocol, to schedule radio resources and to receive<br>
and/or transmit data using available radio resources. The wireless<br>
communication system 100 may also comprises other infrastructure entities<br>
for performing management functionality including data routing, admission<br>
control, subscriber billing, terminal authentication, etc., which may be<br>
 <br>
controlled by other network entities. These entities are not illustrated but<br>
are known generally by those having ordinary skill in the art.<br>
[0015]	In one embodiment illustrated in FIG. 2, a wireless<br>
communication infrastructure entity 200, for example, a base station or<br>
packet control unit (PCU) comprises a transceiver 210 for communicating<br>
with schedulable wireless terminals in the network, for example, terminal<br>
102 in FIG. 1. The infrastructure entity includes a controller 220<br>
communicably coupled to the transceiver. The infrastructure entity<br>
performs scheduling functions including the assignment of radio resources<br>
to wireless terminals in the network. For example, the infrastructure entity<br>
may assign one or more time slots to the wireless terminals. More<br>
generally, the assigned radio resources may be a time-frequency resource.<br>
In one embodiment, the controller includes a scheduling module 222 or<br>
other logical entity for performing scheduling. The scheduling module is<br>
readily implemented in software.<br>
[0016]	In FIG. 2, the wireless communication infrastructure entity 200<br>
sends non-scheduling information, for example, acknowledgement<br>
information, to the wireless communication terminal on a single block<br>
uplink scheduling field in a downlink block. Acknowledgment information<br>
includes, for example, ACK and NACK information, which is sent to the<br>
terminal based on whether information is received from the first wireless<br>
communication terminal on one or more of its assigned time slots. In one<br>
embodiment, the controller includes a single block uplink scheduling field<br>
configuration module 224 or other logical entity for configuring the single<br>
 <br>
block uplink scheduling field of the downlink block with non-scheduling<br>
information. The single block uplink scheduling field configuration module<br>
is readily implemented in software. After configuring the single block<br>
uplink scheduling field, the transceiver transmits the non-scheduling<br>
information to the wireless terminal in a downlink block.<br>
[0017]	In one embodiment specific to GPRS/EDGE applications, the<br>
network infrastructure entity transmits the non-scheduling information in<br>
an unused Relative Reserved Block Period (RRBP) field. In GERAN, the<br>
RRBP field is a 2-bit data field in a downlink RLC/MAC block. According<br>
to this embodiment, the single block uplink scheduling field of the<br>
downlink block is the RRBP field. The RRBP value normally specifies a<br>
single uplink block in which the mobile station transmits either a packet<br>
control acknowledgment message or a packet access control channel block<br>
to the network as specified in 3GPP TS 44.060 V6.16.0, 10.4.5. According to<br>
the present disclosure the RRBP field is used, unconventionally, to<br>
communicate non-scheduling information, for example, acknowledgement<br>
information, to a wireless terminal.<br>
[0018]	In GPRS/EDGE (GERAN) applications, generally, the network<br>
infrastructure entity may validate or invalidate the RRBP field. The<br>
Supplementary/Polling (S/P) Bit is used to indicate whether the RRBP field<br>
is valid or not valid in GPRS applications, as disclosed 3GPP TS 44.060<br>
V6.16.0 10.4.4. When the S/P Bit is set to "0", RRBP is not valid and when<br>
set to "1" RRBP is valid. In EDGE applications, the ES/P field is used to<br>
indicate whether the RRBP field is valid or not valid, and what fields the<br>
 <br>
next uplink control block shall contain. In FIG. 2, in one embodiment, the<br>
network infrastructure entity controller includes a single block uplink<br>
scheduling field in/validation module or other logical entity 226 for<br>
validating or invalidating the single block uplink scheduling field, for<br>
example, the RRBP field, of the downlink block. The single block uplink<br>
scheduling field in/validation module is typically implemented in software.<br>
[0019]	In GERAN based networks including legacy and non-legacy<br>
wireless communication terminals, the network infrastructure entity may<br>
validate the RRBP field for legacy terminals in the network. A legacy<br>
terminal does not comply with the High Speed Hybrid Automatic Repeat<br>
Request (HS-HARQ) protocol and a non-legacy terminal does comply with<br>
HS-HARQ.<br>
[0020]	In one embodiment where the RRBP is validated for legacy<br>
terminals in GERAN network, the network infrastructure entity transmits a<br>
downlink block having an RRBP field that includes ACK information<br>
encoded as an available minimal scheduling delay for a non-legacy<br>
terminal. In another embodiment where the RRBP is validated for legacy<br>
terminals in GERAN network, the network infrastructure entity transmits a<br>
downlink block having an RRBP field that includes NACK information<br>
encoded as available scheduling delays excluding a minimal scheduling<br>
delay for a non-legacy terminal.<br>
[0021]	In some embodiments where the RRBP is validated for legacy<br>
terminals in GERAN network, the network infrastructure entity transmits a<br>
 <br>
downlink block having an RRBP field that includes acknowledgement<br>
information for a non-legacy terminal and the RRBP field includes uplink<br>
scheduling information for a legacy terminal.<br>
[0022]	In GERAN, the RRBP field is a 2-bit data field. In one GERAN<br>
application where the RRBP field is valid for legacy terminals, one bit of the<br>
2-bit data field includes acknowledgement information for a first uplink<br>
block and the other bit of the 2-bit data field includes acknowledgement<br>
information for a second, different uplink block. The encoding of the 2 bits<br>
of acknowledgement data results in the legacy mobile interpreting the RRBP<br>
field as one of four possible delay values. In another GERAN application<br>
where the RRBP field is valid for legacy terminals, one bit of the 2-bit data<br>
field includes acknowledgement information for at least two different<br>
uplink data blocks and the other bit of the 2-bit data field includes<br>
acknowledgement information for one uplink data block different than the<br>
two different uplink data blocks.<br>
[0023]	In embodiments where the RRBP is invalidated for legacy<br>
terminals in GERAN networks, the network infrastructure entity transmits a<br>
downlink block having an RRBP field that includes acknowledgement<br>
information, for example, ACK and/or NAK information, for a non-legacy<br>
terminal. In one particular application where the RRBP is a 2-bit data field,<br>
one bit of the RRBP field includes acknowledgement information for a first<br>
uplink block and the other bit of the RRBP field includes acknowledgement<br>
information for a second, different uplink block. In another application<br>
where the RRBP is a 2-bit data field that is invalidated for legacy terminals,<br>
 <br>
one bit of the 2-bit data field includes acknowledgement information for at<br>
least two different uplink data blocks and the other bit of the 2-bit data field<br>
includes acknowledgement information for one uplink data block different<br>
than the two different uplink data blocks.<br>
[0024]	FIG. 3 illustrates a non-legacy mobile terminal or station 300<br>
comprising a transceiver 310 for receiving non-scheduling information in a<br>
single block uplink scheduling field of a downlink block, for example, in an<br>
RRBP field of an RLC/MAC downlink block. The mobile station 300<br>
includes a controller 320 communicably coupled to the transceiver. The<br>
controller includes a decoding module 322 for decoding non-scheduling<br>
information from the RRBP field. The terminal 300 also includes a user<br>
interface with inputs and outputs that are not illustrated but are well known<br>
to those having ordinary skill in the art.<br>
[0025]	In embodiments where the RRBP field is a 2-bit data field and<br>
the RRBP field is invalidated for legacy terminals, the legacy terminal may<br>
receive acknowledgement information in one bit of the 2-bit data field for a<br>
single uplink data block and acknowledgement information for a different<br>
uplink block in the other bit of the 2-bit data field. In another embodiment,<br>
one bit of the 2-bit data field includes acknowledgement information for at<br>
least two separate uplink data blocks.<br>
[0026]	In FIG. 4, a wireless communication entity 400, for example, a<br>
base station, packet control unit or a mobile terminal, comprises a<br>
transceiver 410 communicably coupled to a controller 420. The controller is<br>
 <br>
configured to generate a first codeword from data and from an error<br>
correcting code, wherein the first codeword including redundancy. In one<br>
embodiment, the controller includes a first codeword generating module or<br>
other logical entity 422 for generating the first codeword. The first<br>
codeword generating module may be readily implemented in software.<br>
[0027]	In the process flow diagram 500 of FIG. 5, at 510, the wireless<br>
communication entity generates the first codeword from data and from an<br>
error correcting code, wherein the first codeword including redundancy. In<br>
one embodiment the first codeword by encoding the data using a cyclic<br>
redundancy code (CRC), for example, a FIRE Code. Other suitable error<br>
correcting codes include, but are not limited to, Hamming codes, Reed-<br>
Solomon codes, low density parity check codes, Bose, Ray-Chaudhuri,<br>
Hocquenghem (BCH) codes, Turbo codes, and convolutional codes, among<br>
others.<br>
[0028]	In FIG. 4, the controller is also configured to generate a second<br>
codeword by encoding additional data on a portion of the first codeword.<br>
In one embodiment, the controller includes a second codeword generating<br>
module or other logical entity 424 for generating the second codeword. The<br>
second codeword generating module may also be readily implemented in<br>
software. In one embodiment, the portion of the first codeword on which<br>
the additional data is encoded is within an error correction capability of the<br>
first codeword and particularly the error correcting code. The portion of the<br>
first code word on which the additional data is encoded may be contiguous<br>
or non-contiguous. The error correcting capability of the error correcting<br>
 <br>
code is generally increased when the decoder knows which portion of the<br>
first codeword on which the additional data has been encoded.<br>
[0029]	In FIG. 5, at 520, the wireless communication entity generates<br>
the second codeword by encoding the additional data on the portion of the<br>
first codeword. In one embodiment, the second codeword is generated by<br>
X-ORing the additional data on the portion of the first codeword. In<br>
another embodiment, the second codeword is generated by replacing a<br>
portion of the first codeword with the additional data. The portion of the<br>
first codeword on which the additional data is encoded is within an error<br>
correction capability of the first codeword and particularly the error<br>
correcting code. If the decoder knows that the additional data has been<br>
encoded and on which portion of the first codeword the additional data has<br>
been encoded, the error correcting capability of the error correcting code is<br>
increased.<br>
[0030]	In one embodiment, the additional data encoded on the first<br>
code word is acknowledgement information, for example, ACK and/or<br>
NAK information. In other embodiments, more generally, however other<br>
information may be encoded on a portion of the first code word. In FIG. 4,<br>
the controller is also configured to encode the second codeword. In some<br>
applications tail bits may be added to the second codeword before<br>
encoding. The encoding of the second codeword is generally dependent<br>
upon the communication protocol in which the process is implemented.<br>
The controller includes a second codeword encoding module or other<br>
logical entity 426 for this purpose. Encoding is illustrated at 530 in FIG. 5.<br>
 <br>
[0031]	In another embodiment, the second code word is formed by<br>
decoding data and encoded additional data from a codeword using a first<br>
correcting code, for example, a convolutional code or some other code. A<br>
possible additional data is hypothesized, and the hypothesized additional<br>
data is encoded onto the second codeword. The data and additional data<br>
are decoded from the second codeword using a second error correcting<br>
codes, for example, a FIRE code or some other code. Errors are detected in<br>
the data and additional data using the second error correcting codes, for<br>
example, the FIRE code. A single allowed remainder is produced during<br>
error detection.<br>
[0032]	In an embodiment suitable for GERAN acknowledgement<br>
applications, the first codeword is formed by encoding the data using a<br>
FIRE code, and the second codeword is formed by X-ORing<br>
acknowledgement information on a contiguous portion of the first<br>
codeword. In some GERAN applications, codeword, the second codeword<br>
is encoded with a one-half rate convolutional encoder, possibly after adding<br>
tail bits. The process of FIG. 5 is more generally applicable to encoding<br>
other additional information on a portion of a first codeword for use in<br>
other wireless communication protocols, for example, UMTS, EUTRA, WiFi,<br>
WiMAX, and 4G among other applications. Different encoding schemes<br>
may also be used, for example, the second codeword may be encoded using<br>
a turbo code.<br>
[0033]	In some wireless communication applications that include non-<br>
legacy wireless terminals, for example, in GERAN, first and second<br>
 <br>
terminals may simultaneously communicate with a network infrastructure<br>
entity, for example, a base station or packet control unit, on substantially<br>
same carrier frequency within a defined tolerance. Under some<br>
circumstances, a typical base station tolerance would be approximately 0.05<br>
ppm of the nominal carrier frequency station and a typical base terminal<br>
tolerance would be approximately 0.10 ppm of the nominal carrier<br>
frequency, though these examples are not intended to be limiting. In one<br>
embodiment, a first mobile terminal transmits a data block in a time slot to<br>
the network infrastructure entity and a second mobile terminal transmits a<br>
High Redundancy Acknowledgement Message (HRAM) comprising<br>
multiple vectors in the same time slot. According to this aspect of the<br>
disclosure, the data block and the HRAM are transmitted on the<br>
substantially same carrier frequency, the data block and the HRAM are non-<br>
orthogonal, and the data block is transmitted at a power level greater than<br>
the HRAM, thereby avoiding irreversible error at the network infrastructure<br>
entity. In one embodiment, the HRAM is confined to a portion of the time<br>
slot, for example to the mid-amble portion thereof.<br>
[0034]	The GERAN wireless communication network infrastructure<br>
entity thus receives a data block from the first terminal and HRAM from the<br>
second terminal in the same time slot. In one embodiment, the HRAM<br>
vector is combined with a sequence associated with a mobile station<br>
temporary block flow. And in another embodiment, the HRAM vector is<br>
combined with a sequence associated with a cell in which the GSM wireless<br>
communication network infrastructure entity is located.<br>
 <br>
[0035]	In GERAN applications, latency may be reduced to at least<br>
some extent by implementing one or more portions of the forgoing<br>
disclosure while maintaining interoperability with legacy GPRS and EGPRS<br>
terminals.<br>
[0036]	While the present disclosure and the best modes thereof have<br>
been described in a manner establishing possession and enabling those of<br>
ordinary skill to make and use the same, it will be understood and<br>
appreciated that there are equivalents to the exemplary embodiments<br>
disclosed herein and that modifications and variations may be made thereto<br>
without departing from the scope and spirit of the inventions, which are to<br>
