				<td>Devices, Systems, and Methods for Adaptive RF Sensing in Arc Fault Detection<br>
Background<br>
[1] United States Patent No. 5,729,145 (Blades), which is incorporated by<br>
reference herein in its entirety, allegedly recites that "[a]rcing in an AC power<br>
system is detected by monitoring the power waveform for wideband high-<br>
frequency noise, and examining the detected noise for patterns of variation in<br>
its amplitude synchronized to the power waveform. A narrowband, swept-<br>
frequency detector and synchronous averaging may be employed to improve<br>
discrimination of arc noise from background interference. An arcing fault<br>
interrupter for controlling a single circuit, and a whole house monitor, for<br>
detecting arcing anywhere in a house, are described." See Abstract.<br>
[2] United States Patent Publication No. 20050254187 (Chu), which is<br>
incorporated by reference herein in its entirety, allegedly recites an "apparatus<br>
and method for event-based detection of arc faults in a circuit. At least one<br>
sensor is arranged to sense anomaly events in an electrical signal in the circuit.<br>
The anomaly events include distortions of the waveform of the electrical<br>
signal. A processor identifies tne anomaly events, and generates an alarm<br>
signal when the anomaly event?, are indicative of an arc fault. The anomaly<br>
events may include current waveform distortions and/or voltage waveform<br>
distortions. Waveform distortions may be measured indirectly; an impedance<br>
may be placed in series with the circuit, so that distortions of the current<br>
produces distortions in the voltage drop across the impedance, in which case<br>
those voltage distortions may be anomaly events. Arc faults may be identified<br>
by examining intervals such as individual AC cycles for anomaly events, then<br>
determining whether at least n of a moving series of m intervals include at<br>
least p such anomaly events. An actuator may be used to oppose any arc faults<br>
that are detected, such as a circuit breaker to interrupt the circuit, so as to<br>
provide arc fault protection. Existing circuits may be retrofitted with the<br>
sensor and processor for arc fault detection, along with an actuator for arc fault<br>
protection." See Abstract.<br>
 <br>
[3] United States Patent No. 6,459,273 (Dollar), which is incorporated by<br>
reference herein in its entirety, allegedly recites a "sputtering arc fault detector<br>
(10) for a system having an electrical conductor (14) carrying current to a<br>
load. The sputtering arc fault detector includes a current monitor (64) coupled<br>
to the conductor for generating a variable signal responsive to behavior of the<br>
current in the conductor. A level detector (58) is coupled to the monitor and<br>
generates a first pulse when the variable signal exceeds a first level. A step<br>
detector (62) is coupled to the monitor and is responsive to rapid step<br>
increases of the variable signal. The step detector generates a second pulse<br>
when the variable signal exceeds a second level. An arc verifier (48), which is<br>
coupled to the level detector and the step detector, combines the first and<br>
second pulses, and generates a fault signal when the combined pulses exceed a<br>
third level." See Abstract.<br>
Summary<br>
[4] Certain exemplary embodiments comprise a method, which can comprise<br>
automatically generating an output signal responsive to an input signal. The<br>
input signal can be indicative of an arc fault. The output signal can be<br>
configured to cause an electrical circuit to open. The output signal can be<br>
generated responsive to a derived signal based upon a first threshold having a<br>
first amplitude.<br>

Detailed Description<br>
[164] Certain exemplary embodiments provide a method, which can comprise<br>
automatically generating an output signal responsive to an input signal. The<br>
input signal can be indicative of an arc fault. The output signal can be<br>
configured to cause an electrical circuit to open. The output signal can be<br>
generated responsive to a derived signal based upon a first threshold having a<br>
first amplitude.<br>
[165] Low amperage arcing in Alternating Current (AC) power systems can be<br>
distinguished from non-arcing conditions through the measurement of<br>
broadband Radio Frequency (RF) energy content generated by the fault. One<br>
or more Broadband over Power Line (BPL) signals and/or noise signals can be<br>
characterized by waveforms that can comprise similar characteristics to arc<br>
fault generated waveforms. Noise can be conducted within an AC power<br>
system and/or can be radiated.<br>
[166] Certain exemplary embodiments can distinguish between and arc fault and<br>
BPL and/or noise signals and/or waveforms. Certain exemplary embodiments<br>
can allow an arc fault detector, based on sensing RF energy, to operate in the<br>
presence of various broadband Radio Frequency (RF) noise sources of varying<br>
intensities and with frequency content that includes frequencies being utilized<br>
for arc fault detection. Additionally, multiple noise sources might be<br>
compensated for simultaneously.<br>
[167] Certain exemplary embodiments can be adapted to discriminate between<br>
arcing and non-arcing conditions when environmental broadband RF noise<br>
conditions are not assumed to be constant for all installation locations and/or<br>
at different times at a particular location. Certain exemplary embodiments can<br>
update certain threshold amplitudes used in the analysis of arc fault sensor<br>
data based on a history of the sensor data. An update of threshold amplitudes<br>
based on recent historical sensor data can provide relatively good performance<br>
of an arc fault detection system in the presence of environmental RF noise.<br>
Environmental noise can be assumed to be constant over short time durations.<br>
 <br>
[168] In certain exemplary embodiments, an RF signal can be obtained from an AC<br>
branch through an RF sensor that could be an E-core shape ferrite sensor. The<br>
signal can be mixed with an oscillating carrier. Certain exemplary<br>
embodiments can comprise one or more algorithms adapted to determine a<br>
relevance of broadband RF signals. The signal, once mixed with the carrier,<br>
can be filtered and/or amplified. An energy level of the signal can be<br>
measured, quantified, and/or represented with a corresponding received signal<br>
strength indicator (RSSI). The RSSI signal can be a variable signal that can<br>
represent broadband conditions (e.g., arc fault conditions), other sources of<br>
broadband information broadcasting in an AC circuit branch, and/or<br>
broadband environmental noise, etc.<br>
[169] Certain exemplary embodiments can be implemented in one or more of<br>
hardware (such as in the form of a microprocessor and/or an Application<br>
Specific Integrated Circuit, etc.), firmware, and/or software. Certain<br>
exemplary embodiments can comprise a mixed-signal microprocessor with<br>
Analog-to-Digital conversion (A/D) capabilities. The microprocessor can be<br>
selected based pn one or more characteristics of sensors and/or algorithms<br>
associated with arc fault detection.<br>
[170] An A/D input to the microprocessor can be driven by a variable signal that can<br>
represent broadband RF signal strength (energy) caused potentially by an arc<br>
fault and/or sources of RF noise. The microprocessor can execute both an<br>
adaptive sensor algorithm as well as an arc fault detection algorithm.<br>
[171] Certain exemplary embodiments can adjust threshold amplitudes used in<br>
analyzing sensor data to improve the performance of a system that might<br>
operate in differing RF noise environments. An arc fault detection algorithm<br>
that analyzes the sensor data in ical time to determine if arcing is occurring<br>
can use these threshold amplitudes. The threshold amplitudes can be voltage<br>
values that can be used to determine certain characteristics of the input RSSI<br>
signal. The adjustments can be calculated based on historical sensor data<br>
 <br>
collected over a relatively short time interval (e.g., a few seconds).<br>
Adjustments might be made when a relatively small level of variation is<br>
detected in historical sensor data. A relatively small level of variation can be<br>
an indication that no arcing conditions are occurring and that detected<br>
environmental broadband RF noise is relatively constant. When a relatively<br>
small level of variation is detected, certain exemplary embodiments can<br>
comprise an algorithm adapted to adjust threshold amplitudes to compensate<br>
for changes in one or more background noise characteristics.<br>
[172] In certain exemplary embodiments, the algorithm for adjusting one or more<br>
threshold amplitudes can operate in parallel with a companion arc fault<br>
detection algorithm. Certain exemplary embodiments can utilize sensor data<br>
from the A/D converter that can also be adapted for use by other algorithms,<br>
such as the arc fault detection algorithm. Certain exemplary embodiments<br>
might not process all incoming data in analyzing relatively long-term trends in<br>
historical data. In certain exemplary embodiments, the algorithm for adjusting<br>
one or more threshold amplitudes can be adapted to execute at a<br>
predetermined time interval. The predetermined time interval can be<br>
approximately, in milliseconds, 150, 135.6, 99, 84.9, 77.2, 40, 33.4, 25,12,<br>
8.2, 5, 2.2, 2, and any value or subrange therebetween. Certain exemplary<br>
embodiments can comprise a handshaking mechanism between algorithms to<br>
attempt to avoid changes to threshold amplitudes during analyses by other<br>
algorithms (e.g., the arc fault detection algorithm). Thus, certain exemplary<br>
embodiments might not update threshold amplitudes if one or more<br>
companion algorithms signal that an analysis for potential arcing conditions is<br>
in progress.<br>
[173] Certain exemplary embodiments can be adapted to wait for a predetermined<br>
time period after a handshaking signal from the companion algorithm indicates<br>
that the companion algorithm is idle and waiting for a next potential arcing<br>
condition. The predetermined time period can be approximately, in<br>
milliseconds, 1000, 800.1, 625, 499, 386.1, 300, 277, 188.1,99, 50,25, and/or<br>
any value or subrange therebetween.<br>
 <br>
[174] After the predetermined time period, certain exemplary embodiments can<br>
begin collecting data to determine if a threshold amplitude update might be<br>
desired and, if so, what the new threshold amplitudes should be.<br>
[175] FIG. 1 is a plot of signal strength waveforms generated by both an exemplary<br>
arc fault condition and by an exemplary noise condition. An arc fault<br>
condition can result in a signal that can be characterized by an arc fault<br>
waveform 1400. A noise condition can result in a signal that can be<br>
characterized by a noise waveform 1300. Noise waveform 1300 can be<br>
characterized by one or more gap time intervals such as first gap time interval<br>
1500 and second gap time inteivaJ 1600. First gap time interval 1500 can be<br>
of a distinct and measurably different duration that second gap interval 1600.<br>
Noise waveform 1300 can be characterized by an amplitude 1350.<br>
[176] A first threshold 1100 and/or a second threshold 1200 can be associated with<br>
an arc fault detection circuit configured to distinguish between noise<br>
waveform 1300 and arc fault waveform 1400. First threshold 1100 and<br>
second threshold 1200 can be configured to be changed responsive to a<br>
detected change in signal characteristics of the noise signal characterized by<br>
noise waveform 1300.<br>
[177] FIG. 2 is a block diagram of an exemplary embodiment of a system 2000,<br>
which can comprise a circuit 2100, an alternating current through which can<br>
be sensed and/or detected by sensor 2200. A signal from sensor 2200 can be<br>
provided to filter 2250. Filter 2250 can be configured to derive an RSSI signal<br>
and a load current signal from the signal from sensor 2200. Filter 2250 can be<br>
configured to provide signals characterized by the RSSI waveform and/or the<br>
load current waveform to information device 2300 for processing. Prior to<br>
and/or at information device 2300, the signal can be processed and/or<br>
sampled. At information device 2300, the resulting data can be analyzed to<br>
identify, for example, to determine if a number of zero crossings of a<br>
waveform during a predetermined time period is above a first predetermined<br>
 <br>
threshold, yet below a second predetermined threshold. Based on a signal<br>
generated by information device 2300, such as in response to a determination<br>
and/or detection of an arcing event 2600 and/or an arcing condition, and/or<br>
detection of a hazardous arcing condition, an actuator 2400 can cause a switch<br>
2500 to interrupt circuit 2100. Switch 2500 can be a circuit breaker, such as<br>
an Arc Fault Circuit Interrupter (AFCI). Switch 2500 can be a device<br>
configured to open circuit 2100 responsive to an output signal.<br>
[178] In certain exemplary embodiments, information device 2300 can comprise a<br>
processor, which can be configured to automatically generate an output signal<br>
responsive to an input signal. The input signal can be indicative of an arc<br>
fault. The output signal can be configured to cause circuit 2100 to open, such<br>
as via opening switch 2500. The output signal can be generated responsive to<br>
a derived signal based upon a first threshold having a first amplitude. The first<br>
threshold can be changed from the first amplitude to a second amplitude if a<br>
predetermined percentage of historical sampled values of a measured electrical<br>
parameter are within a predetermined range during a predetermined time<br>
period. The second amplitude for the first threshold can be based upon an<br>
average of a predetermined count of the historical sampled values of the<br>
measured electrical parameter.<br>
[179] In certain exemplary embodiments, sensor 2200, filter 2250, information<br>
device 2300, actuator 2400, and/or switch 2500 can be comprised by a circuit<br>
breaker 2700.<br>
[180] FIG. 3 is a flowchart of an exemplary embodiment of a method 3000. At<br>
activity 3100, a determination can be made whether an arc fault detection<br>
algorithm is executing. The arc fault algorithm can be any exemplary<br>
algorithm known to one skilled in the art. If the arc fault detection algorithm<br>
is executing, certain exemplary embodiments can avoid an update to one or<br>
more threshold amplitudes associated with the arc fault detection algorithm.<br>
In certain exemplary embodiments, activity 3100 can be repeated at<br>
predetermined and/or random times during activities of method 3000. In<br>
 <br>
certain exemplary embodiments, a potential change of a threshold can be<br>
terminated responsive to a determination that the arc fault determination<br>
algorithm is operational.<br>
[181] At activity 3200, a start time can be determined. For example, the start time<br>
can be based upon an elapsed predetermined time interval since method 3000<br>
has detected an idle status of the arc fault detection algorithm.<br>
[182] At activity 3300, sampled values can be obtained and/or recorded. The<br>
sampled values can be obtained from an obtained input signal. In certain<br>
exemplary embodiments, a predetermined number of sampled values can be<br>
obtained and/or stored. The count of sampled values can be any count, such<br>
as, 500, 399,243, 122, 98, 76, 56,41, 24,12, 8,4, 2, and/or any value or<br>
subrange therebetween. In certain exemplary embodiments, each of the<br>
sampled values can be obtained at a predetermined time interval. The<br>
predetermined time interval can be approximately, in milliseconds, 300,243.7,<br>
199, 176, 154.3,100, 85.1,44.3, 24,12,6,4, 2, and/or any value or subrange<br>
therebetween.<br>
[ 183] At activity 3400, a determination can be: made of a percentage of samples<br>
comprising values within a predetermined range. For example, all sampled<br>
values can be compared to a predetermined limit. When the sampled values<br>
are voltages, the predetermined limit can be approximately, in millivolts (mV).<br>
500,422.5,350, 299.1, 187.6,100, 77.3, 50, 33.2, 25, 20, 18.1,12, 10, and/or<br>
any value or subrange therebetween. In certain exemplary embodiments,<br>
activity 3400 can be repeated after a predetermined amount of time has<br>
elapsed. The predetermined amount of time can be approximately, in seconds,<br>
50,33.1,28.8, 16.4,12, 9.9,5.4,4,2,0.9,0.5, and/or any value or subrange<br>
therebetween.<br>
[184] In certain exemplary embodiments, if a predetermined percentage of samples<br>
are within a predetermined range, a decision can be made to update threshold<br>
amplitudes. If a predetermined percentage of samples is not within the<br>
 <br>
predetermined range, a decision can be made to reset method 3000 and not<br>
update the threshold amplitudes. The predetermined percentage can be<br>
approximately, 98, 88.8, 75.3, 68.1, 60, 50, 45,41,1 33, 27.4, 20, and/or any<br>
value or subrange therebetween. Thus, in certain exemplary embodiments, a<br>
particular threshold amplitude might be changed only when a predetermined<br>
variation measure associated with the predetermined count of historical<br>
sampled values is below a predetermined threshold and/or magnitude.<br>
[185] At activity 3500, an average of a predetermined count of samples can be<br>
determined. The predetermined count of samples to be averaged can be<br>
approximately 100, 67,50, 45, 31,17, 12, 8,4,3, and/or any value or<br>
subrange dierebetween.<br>
[186] At activity 3600, one or more updated threshold amplitudes can be<br>
determined. For example, a lower threshold amplitude can be determined by<br>
adding a first predetermined increment to the average of the predetermined<br>
samples. The first predetermined increment can be approximately, in<br>
millivolts, 500, 411, 345.6, 234.9, 166.6,100, 98,80.1,65, 50, 24,20, and/or<br>
any value or subrange therebetween. An upper threshold amplitude can be<br>
determined by adding a second predetermined increment to the average of the<br>
predetermined samples. The second predetermined increment can be<br>
approximately, in millivolts, 1000, 812, 677.6,480.4, 333.3,200,181,155.3,<br>
112, 99.6, 56.0, 40, and/or any value or subrange dierebetween.<br>
[187] At activity 3700, one or more threshold amplitudes can be updated. For<br>
example, the threshold amplitudes determined in activity 3600 can be stored in<br>
one or more predetermined locations for use as threshold amplitudes for the<br>
arc fault detection algorithm.<br>
[188] At activity 3800, the arc fault detection algorithm can execute based upon the<br>
updated threshold amplitudes. The arc fault detection algoritfim can be<br>
adapted to obtain an input signal from one or more input signal sensors. The<br>
input signal can be mixed with an oscillating carrier. The mixed signal can be<br>
 <br>
filtered. The filtered signal can be amplified. An energy magnitude of the<br>
amplified signal can be measured. The energy magnitude of the amplified<br>
signal can be compared against one or more threshold amplitudes to determine<br>
if additional arc fault tests should be performed. In certain exemplary<br>
embodiments, the arc fault detection algorithm can derive and/or obtain the<br>
RSSI signal. The RSSI signal can be analyzed to determine the presence of an<br>
arc fault.<br>
[189] At activity 3900, a circuit breaker can be tripped responsive to a determination<br>
of an arc fault by the arc fauli detection algorithm. For example, an output<br>
signal can be automatically generated responsive to an input signal. The input<br>
signal can be indicative of an arc fault. The, output signal can be configured<br>
to cause an electrical circuit to open (e.g.,.the circuit breaker can be tripped).<br>
The output signal can be generated responsive to a derived signal (e.g., the<br>
RSSI signal) based upon a fim threshold having a first amplitude. The first<br>
threshold can be changed from the first amplitude to a second amplitude if a<br>
predetermined percentage of historical sampled values of a measured electrical<br>
parameter are within a predetermined range during a predetermined time<br>
period. The second amplitude for the first threshold can be based upon an<br>
average of a predetermined count of the historical sampled values of the<br>
measured electrical parameter.<br>
[190] The output signal can be generated responsive to the derived signal, which can<br>
be based upon a second threshold having a third amplitude. The first threshold<br>
can be changed from the third amplitude to a fourth amplitude if a<br>
predetermined percentage of historical sampled values of a measured electrical<br>
parameter are within a predetermined range during a predetermined time<br>
period. The fourth amplitude for the second threshold can be based upon the<br>
average of the predetermined count of the historical sampled values of the<br>
measured electrical parameter.<br>
[191] FIG. 4 is a block diagram of an exemplary embodiment of an information<br>
device 4000, which in certain operative embodiments can comprise, for<br>
 <br>
example, information device 2300, of BIG. 2. Information device 4000 can<br>
comprise any of numerous components, such as for example, one or more<br>
network interfaces 4100, one or more processors 4200, one or more memories<br>
4300 containing instructions 4400, one or more input/output (I/O) devices<br>
4500, and/or one or more user interfaces 4600 coupled to I/O device 4500, etc.<br>
[192} In certain exemplary embodiments, via one or more user interfaces 4600, such<br>
as a graphical user interface, a user can view a rendering of information<br>
related to detecting an arc fault, changing one or more threshold amplitudes<br>
related to an arc fault detection system, and/or tripping a circuit breaker<br>
responsive to a detected arc fault, etc.<br>
