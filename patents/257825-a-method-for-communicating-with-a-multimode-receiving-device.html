				<td>[0003]	Some multimode receiving devices are known that have, for example,<br>
two independent receive chains (and transmit chains) such that they have dual<br>
receivers, one receiver dedicated to each of the different wireless systems. For<br>
example, with WCDMA and group special mobile systems (GSM) multimode<br>
systems, a multimode receiving device may scan and find, for example, the GSM<br>
system when the WCDMA system is operating in a discontinuous mode. For<br>
example, in a discontinuous mode, the WCDMA system is not in time<br>
synchronization with a GSM system and sooner or later, the multimode receiving<br>
device will locate a GSM channel, but the eventual location can waste bandwidth of a<br>
WCDMA transmission. As such, inefficient processing can occur.<br>
[0004]	Single mode systems are known such as a system that uses, for<br>
example, a global positioning satellite system to provide a synchronized time base for<br>
a cellular base site. However, such systems are single mode systems in that the<br>
receiving devices, such as the mobile devices, communicate via the cellular system<br>
only. Such GPS and cellular systems merely synchronize a single communication<br>
system, namely the cellular system, to a common GPS clock.<br>
[0005]	Also, it is known for cellular systems and other wireless systems to<br>
have a type of control channel that, for example, contains synchronization information to allow devices to synchronize to a cellular system. This may take, for example, the form of a paging channel or a timing synchronization channel or any other suitable channel or information. However, typically, such cellular synchronization data is not in synchronization with a different wireless system for a multimode receiving device. Accordingly, if a multimode receiving device, for example, is listening on its<br>
synchronization channel and the second wireless system, such as a digital broadcast<br>
system is broadcasting information, the broadcast information may not be detected by<br>
the multimode device or if detected, requires the device's processor to process<br>
information from both systems at essentially the same time.<br>
[0006]	For example, multimode systems are also known that have a mobile<br>
multimode receiving device that includes a receiver (and antenna) for receiving<br>
cellular information and another receive chain and an antenna combination for<br>
receiving digital broadcast information. However, if the multimode receiving device<br>
(which also may be a transmitting device if desired), receives digital broadcast<br>
information at the same time as it is listening to a cellular paging channel, the loading<br>
on the processor can be quite large.<br>
[0007]	It would be desirable to have an apparatus and method so that a less<br>
expensive processor may be used that would also potentially draw less current and for<br>
mobile devices, result in a longer lasting battery and a smaller device. Therefore, it<br>
would be desirable to better balance the processing load over time.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
[0016]	Briefly, an apparatus, such as a network element, for use in a system<br>
that communicates with a multimode receiving device, employs a first wireless<br>
system transmitter, such as a broadcast system transmission circuit, to transmit or<br>
broadcast information to the multimode receiving device. An information gating<br>
buffer is operably coupled to a first wireless system transmitter and receives<br>
information to be transmitted by the first wireless system transmitter. A<br>
synchronization controller, operably coupled to the information gating buffer receives<br><br>
synchronization information from a second wireless system, such as from a cellular<br>
system, using a second wireless system receiver circuit, such as a cellular receiver<br>
tuned to receive a paging channel, and uses the timing synchronization information to<br>
control the information gating buffer to gate noncellular information for transmission<br>
from the first wireless system transmitter to the multimode receiving device. For<br>
example, in the case where the plurality of different wireless systems is a digital<br>
broadcast system and a cellular system, a digital broadcast transmission circuit, such<br>
as a portion of a broadcast base site controller, receives synchronization information<br>
from a co-located or non-co-located cellular receiver to determine the synchronization<br>
periods that are used by a multimode receiving device to listen for cellular<br>
synchronization information. The synchronization controller effectively pauses the<br>
broadcast of noncellular transmitted data over a digital broadcast antenna during the<br>
time when the multimode receiving device is listening on the cellular paging channel<br>
to avoid the sending of broadcast information on a non-synchronized system that may<br>
arrive at the multimode receiving device at the same time the multimode receiving<br>
device is listening for information from the other system. When the synchronization<br>
period is over, the second wireless system then transmits the buffered broadcast<br>
information and broadcasts it to the multimode receiving device. Hence, the<br>
information processing loading on the multimode receiving device is effectively<br>
delayed so that the processing operations in the multimode receiving device need only<br>
process information from one of the plurality of non-synchronized systems at any one<br>
time.<br><br>
[0017]	A method is also disclosed that includes receiving timing<br>
synchronization information from a first wireless system, such as a cellular system, or<br>
other wireless system and using the timing synchronization information from the first<br>
wireless system to gate the transmission of information transmitted from a second<br>
wireless system, such as a digital broadcast system or other wireless system, to the<br>
multimode receiving device. From the perspective of the multimode receiving device,<br>
a method is disclosed that includes switching to receive information from the first<br>
wireless system during a synchronization period based on timing synchronization<br>
information from the first wireless system and switching back to another receiver to<br>
receive gated information from a second wireless system after the synchronization<br>
period has ended, wherein the gated information is transmitted from the second<br>
wireless system and was gated, by a network element, based on timing<br>
synchronization information from the first wireless system.<br>
[0018]	As such, the predetermined synchronization periods of one wireless<br>
system are used such that a digital broadcast system or other wireless system gates or<br>
controls information flow from the multimode receiving device, such as a mobile<br>
device or non-mobile device, to schedule transmission of broadcast information in<br>
such a way that the communication from the broadcast system does not occur at the<br>
same time as the mobile device (i.e., the multimode receiving device) is transmitting<br>
or receiving data from the other wireless system. By gating the information on one<br>
system, the multimode receiving device does not require, for example, a complete<br>
dual receiver architecture and instead can have, for example a configurable receiver<br>
that shares some configurable portions among a plurality of receivers and additionally<br><br>
the loading on one or more processors may be more consistent so that a lower cost<br>
processor scheme may be used if desired. Other advantages will be recognized by<br>
those having ordinary skill in the art<br>
[0019]	FIG. 1 illustrates one example of a multimode communication system<br>
100 in accordance with one embodiment of the invention that includes a multimode<br>
receiving device 110 a network element 112 and an antenna 114 By way of example<br>
only, and not limitation, the invention will be described with reference to a multimode<br>
system that includes a cellular system and a digital broadcast system. However, the<br>
invention is equally applicable to any suitable multimode system, including, but not<br>
limited to, multiple mode systems employing different types of cellular systems, such<br>
as CDMA as one system and TDMA system as another, or any suitable multimode<br>
system that employs a plurality of wireless systems wherein the wireless systems are<br>
not synchronized in a time domain. As shown in this example, the first system in this<br>
example is considered to be a cellular system and a second system may be a multicast<br>
broadcast system, or a point cast system or any other suitable digital broadcast<br>
system. However, it will be recognized that any suitable systems may be employed.<br>
[0020]	The multimode receiving device 110 is a device that at least receives<br>
information from both of the non-synchronized systems. Also by way of example,<br>
and not limitation, multimode receiving device 110 will be referred to as a mobile<br>
device such as a cell phone, PDA, internet appliance, laptop computer, or any other<br>
suitable mobile device. However, the invention is equally applicable to non-mobile<br>
devices that serve as multimode receiving devices that or at least receive information<br>
from a plurality of different wireless systems that are not synchronized in a time<br><br>
domain. The multimode receiving device 110 includes a first wireless receiver 116<br>
and associated antenna 118 for receiving, for example, information from a first<br>
wireless system, such as the cellular system. The wireless multimode receiving<br>
device 110 also includes at least a second wireless receiver 120 and corresponding<br>
antenna 122 operative to receive wireless information from a second wireless system,<br>
such as a wireless digital broadcast system. The receivers 116 and 120 may be<br>
conventional receivers as known in the art. Although two antennas are shown, it will<br>
be recognized that if appropriate, a single antenna could be used.<br>
[0021]	For purposes of illustration only, and not limitation, antenna 122<br>
therefore receives broadcast information from broadcast antenna 114 whereas antenna<br>
118 receives cellular information from one more cellular base stations 125. Each of<br>
the first and second wireless receivers 116 and 120 are operably coupled to a<br>
switching mechanism 124, which in this example is shown to be incorporated as part<br>
of control logic 126. The control logic 126 in this example takes the form of a<br>
programmed processor that executes instructions that are stored in a memory (not<br>
shown). However, any suitable structure may be used, including, but not limited to<br>
discreet logic, state machines DSPs, microcontrollers, CPUs, or any suitable<br>
combination of hardware, software or firmware as desired.<br>
[0022]	The control logic 126 is operably coupled to the switching mechanism<br>
124 in this example. The switching mechanism 124 may be, for example, controllable<br>
ports on a processing device which are selected or otherwise accessed by the<br>
processor, and the control logic 126 is operative to switch the switching mechanism<br>
124 to the first wireless receiver 116 to receive information from the first wireless<br><br>
receiver 116 during a synchronization period of the cellular system, based on timing<br>
synchronization from the cellular system. For example, the control logic 126 may<br>
switch the receiver 116 to access apaging channel during a synchronization period<br>
associated with the cellular system. The control logic 126 also controls the switching<br>
mechanism 124 to switch back to receiving information from the second receiver 120<br>
after the synchronization period has ended. As such, when the multimode receiving<br>
device is listening to a cellular paging channel, the control logic 126 controls the<br>
switching mechanism 124 to receive information from the paging channel through<br>
receiver 116. As such the control logic 126 need not process information from the<br>
other system. As such the multimode receiving device 110 listens to either a cellular<br>
channel or direct broadcast channel at any one time.<br>
[0023]	The network element 112 includes a wireless transmission circuit 128,<br>
in this case a second wireless system transmission circuit may be for example a<br>
portion of a direct broadcast base station controller, or any other suitable network<br>
element. The wireless system transmission circuit 128 is operative to transmit<br>
information, such as broadcast information, over the wireless broadcast system, to the<br>
multi-mode receiving device 110 via antenna 114. In this embodiment, the network<br>
element 112 also includes a cellular wireless system receiver circuit 130 that is<br>
operative to wirelessly receive synchronization information, such as synchronization<br>
information from a cellular paging channel, transmitted over the cellular wireless<br>
system. The wireless system receiver 130 may be a conventional cellular receiver that<br>
may be for example co-located as part of the network element 112 such as a broadcast<br>
base site controller if desired. However, as described for example with reference to<br><br>
FIG. 4, the wireless system receiver 130 need not be co-located and instead may be<br>
remotely located if desired. The wireless system receiver 130 receives<br>
synchronization information from the cellular base station 124 or any other suitable<br>
base station within the same cellular system. The timing synchronization information<br>
132, such as frame and slot timing, as noted, may be received for example from a<br>
paging channel of the cellular system. The wireless system receiver 130 receives the<br>
timing synchronization information 132 from the cellular wireless system. The<br>
wireless system receiver 130 provides the timing synchronization information 132 to<br>
the wireless broadcast system transmission circuit 128. As such, synchronization<br>
information from one wireless system is provided to a transmission circuit of the other<br>
and non-synchronized system. By way of example, the timing synchronization<br>
information 132 may be translated by the wireless system receiver 130 into timing<br>
synchronization data 134 that may be for example a synchronization period or other<br>
suitable data of when to begin and/or end the buffering of broadcast information as<br>
described further below.<br>
[0024]	In the context of these specific examples, the second wireless system<br>
transmission circuit 128 may be a digital broadcast transmission circuit that is<br>
operative to transmit digital broadcast information via antenna 114 to the multi-mode<br>
receiving device 110. Likewise, the wireless system receiver 130 may be a cellular<br>
system receiver circuit that is operative to wirelessly receive synchronization<br>
information associated with a cellular system and operative to provide timing<br>
synchronization information or timing synchronization data based on the<br>
synchronization information to the broadcast system transmission circuit.<br><br>
[0025]	In addition if desired, a plurality of wireless system receivers 130<br>
through 130n may provide synchronization information to the wireless transmission<br>
circuit 128 wherein each of the wireless system receivers 130-130n receive timing<br>
synchronization information from differing non-synchronized wireless systems or<br>
different base stations of the same system.<br>
[0026]	As such, in the embodiment where the differing non-synchronized<br>
systems include for example a digital broadcast system and a cellular system, such as<br>
GSM system, as a combined service to a multi-mode receiving device using separate<br>
DXB (digital audio and/or digital video broadcast) and GSM networks, a GSM<br>
mobile phone receiver for example might serve as the system receiver 130 and may be<br>
located as part of DXB base station controller. The GSM receiver (system receiver<br>
130) is tuned to the control channel of a preferred GSM network. The GSM receiver<br>
acquires a GSM control channel and synchronizes to it. The GSM receiver provides<br>
the synchronization dated, or pulse, or other suitable information, to the DXB<br>
transmitter (the wireless system transmission circuit 128) at predetermined points in<br>
the GSM slot and frame structure. These predetermined points are arranged such that<br>
the broadcast information transmitted by the wireless system transmission circuit 128<br>
is scheduled such that the transmission does not occur at the same time as the<br>
multimode receiving device 110 is transmitting or receiving GSM information. By<br>
- doing this, the multimode receiving device does not require a dual receiver<br>
architecture and can have for example a single configurable receiver. Additionally,<br>
the digital broadcast information can be scheduled such that it does not coincide with<br>
the GSM operation of scanning adjacent GSM cells.<br><br>
[0027]	FIG. 2 illustrates one example of a method for communicating with a<br>
multimode receiving device in accordance with one embodiment of the invention as<br>
carried out, for example, by the network element 112 of FIG. 1. However, any<br>
suitable component or group of components may carryout the steps. In block 200, the<br>
method includes receiving timing synchronization information from a wireless<br>
system, such as a cellular system, for example, using wireless system receiver 130 or<br>
other suitable receiver. As shown in block 202, the wireless system receiver, or any<br>
other suitable element or group of elements provides timing synchronization<br>
information 132 to the transmission control circuit 128 associated with a different<br>
wireless system, in this example, a direct broadcast system or other suitable system as<br>
part of the multimode communication system 100. As shown on block 204, the<br>
method includes using the timing synchronization information 132 from the cellular<br>
wireless system to gate the transmission of information from the second wireless<br>
system, such as the direct broadcast system, to the multimode receiving device. This<br>
may include for example pausing the broadcast data over the digital broadcast<br>
network during at least a portion of a synchronization period defined by the<br>
synchronization information 132.<br>
[0028]	FIG. 3 is a flow chart illustrating a method for communicating with a<br>
multimode receiving device taken, for example, from the perspective of a multimode<br>
receiving device. During the synchronization period, for example, the multimode<br>
receiving device, or other suitable device uses control logic 126 to switch to access<br>
the first wireless system, such as a cellular system during the synchronization period<br>
of the first wireless system. This is shown in block 300. As shown in block 302,<br><br>
when the synchronization period is over, the method includes switching to the second<br>
wireless system via the second wireless receiver 120 to receive the gated information<br>
that is communicated over the second wireless system, such as gated broadcast<br>
information.<br>
[0029]	Referring to FIG. 4-6, a more detailed description the operation of the<br>
wireless system transmission circuit 128 will be described. The wireless system<br>
transmission circuit 128 includes an information gating buffer 400 a synchronizing<br>
controller 402 and a transmitter 404. The synchronization controller 402 may be any<br>
suitable logic circuit, programmable processing device or any suitable combination of<br>
hardware, software or firmware. The transmitter may be any conventional transmitter<br>
circuitry. The information gating buffer 400 may be any suitable buffering<br>
mechanism. The information gating buffer has an input 406, such as an input port or<br>
other suitable input operably coupled to receive source information 408 to be<br>
transmitted over antenna 114 via the transmitter 404. Information gating buffer 400<br>
also has an output 410 operably coupled to the transmitter 404. The synchronization<br>
controller 400 is operably coupled to the information gating buffer 400 and receives<br>
the timing synchronization information 132 associated with the different wireless<br>
system. The synchronization controller 400 generates buffer control data 412, which<br>
controls the gating of information from buffer 400 based on the timing<br>
synchronization information 132. The synchronization controller 402 uses the timing<br>
synchronization information 132 to control the information gating buffer 400 to gate<br>
information for transmission from the wireless transmission circuit 128 to the<br>
multimode receiving device 110. In one example, the synchronization controller 402<br><br>
generates a control signal 414 to the transmitter 404 to effectively turn on and turn off<br>
transmission of data read out from the information gating buffer 400. As such, the<br>
transmitter 404 may be turned off to conserve power based on the control signal 414<br>
at an appropriate time. The information gating buffer 400 buffers information for a<br>
period of time determined by the synchronization controller 402 and then the<br>
synchronization controller 402 activates the transmitter 404 to read the buffered data<br>
out for transmission over the antenna 114. As applied to a digital broadcast system,<br>
the information gating buffer 400 is be a broadcast information gating buffer that<br>
receives information to be broadcast by the broadcast transmission circuit (wireless<br>
system transmission circuit 128) via the transmitter 404. Also in the embodiment in<br>
FIG. 4, the wireless system receiver 130 may be a cellular system receiver circuit that<br>
is not co-located with the wireless system transmission circuit. But is operative to<br>
provide timing synchronization data based on synchronization information from the<br>
cellular system. The synchronization controller 402 controls the buffering of<br>
information during at least a portion of the synchronization period associated with the<br>
timing synchronization information.<br>
[0030]	For example, referring to FIG. 5, in the time domain, time slots 500<br>
and 502 associated with the first wireless system, such as a cellular system, define the<br>
wakeup and receive slots in a paging channel. Transmitted information 504<br>
represents the information transmitted from the second wireless system transmission<br>
circuit 128. As noted, the timing synchronization information 132 may represent a<br>
synchronization period during which time the multimode receiving device 110 listens<br>
to a particular slot on a paging channel or scanning for a synchronization block on a<br><br>
channel. During this time, the synchronization controller 402 controls the information<br>
gating buffer 400 using the buffer control data 412 to buffer data during the<br>
synchronization period 132 and, if desired, due to progation delays or other delays,<br>
experienced by device 110, for a period of time longer than the synchronization<br>
period represented as buffered data 506. As such, while the multimode receiving<br>
device is listening on a cellular paging channel, no information is being broadcast by<br>
'	the nonsynchronized broadcast system but the nonsynchronized broadcast system<br>
becomes synchronized by buffering information during the time that the multimode<br>
receiving device is listening to the other network. After the buffering period has<br>
lapsed, the synchronization controller activates the transmitter 404 to read out the<br>
buffered data to transmit the buffered broadcast information after the synchronization<br>
period has ended.<br>
[0031]	FIG. 6 represents an example of the operation of the synchronization<br>
controller 402 when a plurality of wireless system receivers 130 through 130N may<br>
be employed. Buffering is preferably done on a per broadcast channel basis in this<br>
example. As such, in block 600, the method includes selecting the next information<br>
stream from a data source 408 to be transmitted by the digital broadcast system or<br>
transmission circuit 128. This may be done, for example, through a round robin<br>
priority or any other suitable priority. As shown in block 602, the method includes<br>
determining if the destination device is a multimode device. For example, through<br>
apriori knowledge (e.g. data stored in a database), or signaling from the multimode<br>
device or if the service is a multimode service. If the destination device is not a<br>
multimode receiving device, the method includes, as shown in block 604, enabling<br><br>
continuous transmission of source data 408 to antenna 114. As such, the information<br>
gating buffer 400 may be effectively bypassed and the transmitter activated to allow<br>
transmission of information to be broadcast continuously.<br>
[0032]	Referring back to block 602, if the destination device is a multimode<br>
receiving device, the method includes incrementing a counter shown in block 605. As<br>
shown in block 606, the method includes determining if the associated multimode<br>
receiving device is part of a multimode system for which the transmission circuit is<br>
coupled. In other words, the transmission circuit 128 identifies if it is receiving<br>
synchronization information from a wireless system receiver 130-130n that has been'<br>
assigned to this multimode receiving device. The broadcast system knows the<br>
subscribers to the service. As shown in block 608, if the multimode receiving circuit<br>
is part of a system for which the wireless system transmission circuit 128 receives<br>
. synchronization information from, the synchronization information is then obtained<br>
from that particular wireless system receiver circuit. For example, the plurality of<br>
wireless system receiver circuits 130-130n are operatively coupled to the<br>
synchronization controller 402 and each of them provides wirelessly received timing<br>
synchronization information from one or more wireless systems. Once the timing<br>
synchronization information is obtained, the synchronization controller 402 uses the<br>
timing synchronization information to control the information gating buffer to gate<br>
the information for transmission from the broadcast transmission circuit to the<br>
multimode receiving device. In other words, the broadcast wireless system schedules<br>
a gap in transmission with respect to the timing synchronization information from the<br>
cellular system on a per channel basis as shown in block 610. As shown in block 612,<br><br>
the counter is then incremented and a next destination device is evaluated to<br>
determine whether the next destination device is a multimode receiving device as<br>
shown in block 614. If so, the method reverts back to block 606. If not, a next<br>
information stream is selected as shown in block 600.<br>
[0033]	FIG. 7 is ablock diagram illustrating one example of aportion of a<br>
multimode receiving device 110 in accordance with one embodiment to the present<br>
invention. The multimode receiving device 110 includes a first system receiver chain<br>
700, a second system receiver chain 702, a switching mechanism 124, the control<br>
logic 126 and a user interface 706. The user interface 706 may be, for example, a<br>
touch screen, keypad or any other suitable user interface, and is used to allow the user<br>
to indicate (select) whether to, for example, make a call on a cellular network or<br>
receive broadcast information on a different and non-synchronized network. As such,<br>
the user interface 706 presents the user with a selection menu to select effectively<br>
which features the user wishes to use and hence the associated network. The selection<br>
information 708 is provided to the control logic 126, which then activates a switch<br>
124 to switch to the first system receiver chain or second system receiver chain 700,<br>
702 depending upon the selected system. Also, the control logic 126 automatically<br>
switches to the cell system periodically when receiving broadcast data to obtain<br>
paging messages or other suitable information. [0034]	In this embodiment, each of the system receiver chains includes a .<br>
common programmable receiver stage such as gain stages or other suitable stages that<br>
may be programrnably reconfigured via control logic 126, via stage control signals<br>
710 and 712 respectively. As such, additional cost savings may be provided by<br><br>
reusing portions of the receiver chain since only one receiver is providing information<br>
at any one time. Error correction processors, packet data reconstruction operations or<br>
other elements may also be reconfigured. The stage control signals 710 and 712 may<br>
be, for example, enable lines or circuits to enable and disable sections of a receiver<br>
chain, such as an amplification stage or other suitable stages if desired.<br>
[0035]	The above apparatus and methods, among other advantages, gate in<br>
broadcast information or other system information when, for example, a mobile<br>
device or other multimode receiving device is listening to a synchronization channel<br>
on a non-synchronized network such as a cellular network. Hence, the multimode<br>
receiving device, which also may have suitable transmitter stages, receives<br>
information from one system to a point where after the multimode receiving device<br>
switches to a different receiver and receives gated information from a different<br>
network. The multimode receiving device switches to a second receiver to receive<br>
gated information transmitted from a first wireless system (e.g. broadcast system) that<br>
was gated, such as by, for example, a network element, based on timing<br>
synchronization information from the second wireless system. As such, an onboard<br>
processor, plurality of processors or other suitable logic, need not process information<br>
from two differing systems at the same time. In addition, if propagation delays and<br>
multipath signals are being received by the multimode receiving device, the gated<br>
information at the broadcast network element is.gated for a longer period of time to<br>
accommodate for the multipath delays. Other advantages will be recognized by those<br>
skilled in the art.<br><br>

described therein have been presented for the purposes of illustration and description.<br>

ABSTRACT<br><br><br>
A METHOD FOR COMMUNICATING WITH<br>
A MULTIMODE RECEIVING DEVICE<br>
An apparatus, such as a network element (112), for use in a system that<br>
communicates with a multimode receiving device (110), employs an<br>
information gating buffer (400) that is operably coupled to a first wireless<br>
system transmitter (404) and receives information to be transmitted by the<br>
wireless system transmitter (404). A synchronization controller (402), operably<br>
coupled to the information gating buffer (400) receives synchronization<br>
information (132) from a second wireless system using a second wireless<br>
system receiver circuit (130), and uses the timing synchronization information<br>
(132) to control the information gating buffer (400) to gate broadcast<br>
information for transmission from a first wireless system transmission circuit<br>
(128) to the multimode receiving device (110). A method includes receiving<br>
(200) timing synchronization information from the first wireless system, and<br>
using (204) the timing synchronization information to gate the transmission of<br>
information transmitted from the second wireless system to the multimode<br>
receiving device.</td>
