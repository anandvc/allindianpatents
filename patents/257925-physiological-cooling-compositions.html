FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates generally to compounds possessing physiological cooling<br>
activity, compositions comprising these compounds and methods for the manufacture<br>
and use thereof.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Physiological cooling agents, commonly known as coolants, continue to gain<br>
popularity for use in various consumer applications due to their recognized ability for<br>
improving desirable sensate properties in consumer products. The desired sensate<br>
properties are generally explained by the chemical action of such coolant compounds on<br>
the nerve endings responsible for the sensation of cold. Common applications and uses<br>
for these compounds include, but are not limited to foods, beverages, flavors,<br>
pharmaceuticals, perfumes, and miscellaneous cosmetic goods.<br>
One of the most well-known physiological coolants is /-menthol, a compound<br>
having the structure shown below, and which has been widely used in several of the<br>
above mentioned applications. In particular, /-menthol has an excellent cooling strength,<br>
low sensitivity threshold, and is relatively inexpensive compared to other coolant<br>
compounds.<br><br>
However, menthol also exhibits several undesirable properties, such as a strong<br>
"stinging" smell, a somewhat bitter taste, and it has a relatively high volatility. These<br>
disadvantages of /-menthol have limited its acceptance for use in various applications<br>
and therefore have stimulated intense research for suitable physiological cooling agents<br>
that possess a low volatility and exhibit a relatively weak odor or even no odor at all.<br>
The primary focus of physiological coolant compound research has been toward<br>
the synthesis of compounds having a hydrocarbon skeleton similar to menthol, but which<br>
also comprise a "heavier" functional group than the hydroxyl functional group of<br><br>
menthol. As a result, a number of synthetic menthol substitutes have been developed<br>
and commercialized.<br>
One commercially important group of synthetic coolants are the N-substituted 3-<br>
p-menthane carboxamides, commonly referred to as p-MCA and having the following<br>
structure:<br><br>
Originally disclosed by Wilkinson Sword Ltd., UK, in a number of patents world wide,<br>
i.e. GB 1,351,761, DE 2,205,255, US 4,033,994, US 4,136,163, and US 4,150,052, N-<br>
substituted 3-p-menthane carboxamides p-MCA represent a larger group of cyclohexane<br>
carboxamides of the general structure 1:<br><br>
also disclosed by Wilkinson Sword Ltd. in DE 2,413,639, GB 1,422,998, US 4,248,859<br>
and US 4,296,093. This larger group of cyclohexane carboxamides not only includes<br>
coolants having a carbon skeleton similar to menthol, but also coolants structurally<br>
unrelated to menthol.<br>
A second commercially important group of synthetic coolants, and a group that is<br>
structurally unrelated to menthol, are the N-monosubstituted acyclic carboxamides of the<br>
general structure 2: <br>
also first disclosed by Wilkinson Sword Ltd. in GB 1,421,743, GB 1,421,744, DE<br>
2,317,538, and US 4,153,679.<br><br>
Substituents X and X1 as referred to in general structures 1 and 2 above are<br>
typically lower linear or branched alkyl groups, such as methyl, ethyl, tertiary butyl; aryl<br>
groups such as p-methoxyphenyl; or functionally substituted alkyl groups such as<br>
ethoxycarbonylmethyl, and the like. Substituents R1, R2, R3, R4, R5, R6, R7, R8, R9, R10,<br>
R11, R12, R13 and R14, as used in general structures 1 and 2 above, are typically<br>
independently hydrogen atoms, lower linear or branched alkyl groups, such as methyl,<br>
ethyl, isopropyl, tertiary butyl, and the like.<br>
Commercially successful members of these two groups of synthetic physiological<br>
cooling agents are N-ethyl-3-p-menthane carboxamide (commonly referred to as WS-3)<br>
and N,2,3-trimethyl-2-isopropylbutanamide (commonly referred to as WS-23), both of<br>
which are available from Millennium Specialty Chemicals, Jacksonville, Florida.<br><br>
Other important carboxamide type physiological coolants include N-<br>
(ethoxycarbonylmethyl)-3-p-menthane carboxamide (WS-5) and N-tert-butyl-3-p-<br>
menthane carboxamide (WS-14).<br><br>
A third commercially important class of synthetic physiological cooling agents<br>
are /-menthol based esters and ethers, having the general structure:<br><br><br>
As used herein, substituent Y typically represents a lactic acid residue -<br>
OC(O)CH(OH)CH3, a monosuccinate residue -OC(O)CH2CH2COOH, a monoglutarate<br>
residue -OC(O)CH2CH2CH2COOH, or a glycerin residue -OCH2CH(OH)CH2OH, and<br>
the like. To date, the most commercially important representatives of this class have been<br>
menthyl lactate (ML) available from Symrise, Givaudan, and Millennium Specialty<br>
Chemicals; menthoxypropanediol (MPD) available from Takasago; monomenthyl<br>
succinate (MMS) available from V.Mane Fils, and monomenthyl glutarate (MMG). In<br>
general however, esters and ethers are weaker cooling agents compared to the above<br>
mentioned carboxamides. To that end, the most commercially important member of the<br>
ester/ether class is Menthyl Lactate ML.<br><br>
Lastly, menthone glycerin acetal (MGA) represents the commercially viable ketal<br>
group of synthetic coolants, and isopulegol (sold under the trade name Coolact® P) and<br>
p-menthane-3,8-diol (sold under the trade name Coolact® 38D) are two examples of the<br>
p-menthanol class of liquid coolants, both of which have also gained significant<br>
popularity as synthetic coolant compounds.<br><br><br>
The spectrum of consumer products that incorporate physiological cooling agents<br>
continues to broaden and thus gives rise to a need for coolant compounds and<br>
compositions having more sophisticated and multifaceted physiological cooling<br>
properties. As a result, combinations of cooling agents are progressively attracting more<br>
attention. This trend is illustrated by numerous reports in the technical and patent<br>
literature, where several different coolants have been used in combination to arrive at a<br>
final consumer formulation.<br>
Several attempts have been made to formulate compositions containing menthol<br>
and one or more synthetic coolant molecules. For example, US Pat Nos. 5,009,893 and<br>
5,698,181 teach that combinations of l-menthol and p-menthane carboxamide in a<br>
chewing gum provide a long-lasting, breath-freshening perception without the bitterness<br>
of /-menthol taken alone. Similarly, US Pat. No. 5,663,460 discloses that the<br>
organoleptic properties of a menthol composition improve when menthol is blended with<br>
pure isopulegol or with MPD.<br>
Attempts have also been made to provide physiological cooling compositions that<br>
contain no menthol or at least insignificant amounts of menthol. These compositions are<br>
particularly desirable when the strong smell and taste of menthol have to be completely<br>
avoided. For example, US Pat. Nos. 5,407,665, 5,681,549 and 5,686,063 teach<br>
combinations of MPD, WS-3 and WS-23, which are incorporated into a mouthwash<br>
composition together with an alkoxy or glycol ether and ethyl acetate or a polyhydric<br>
alcohol as co-solvents or solubilizers. Similarly, after shave lotions according to US Pat<br>
Nos. 5,449,512 and 5,527,530 contain WS-3 or WS-23, or mixtures thereof together with<br>
an alcohol and a low-molecular weight methylsiloxane or acyl lactylate.<br>
Significantly, practically all physiological cooling agents of the carboxamide<br>
groups are solid materials at ambient temperature and atmospheric pressure, usually with<br>
relatively high melting points (see Table 1). A representative of the menthol-based<br>
esters and ethers group of physiological cooling agents, menthyl lactate (ML) is also a<br>
solid material, although with a relatively lower melting point (see Table 1). l-Menthol<br>
itself is a solid with a melting point of approximately 40-44 °C. Several other<br>
commercial cooling agents listed above (MPD, MSS, MMG, MGA, Coolact P® and<br>
Coolact® 38D) exist as liquids at ambient temperature and atmospheric pressure.<br><br><br>
In order to be added into a cooling composition, solid cooling agents must first be<br>
melted and dissolved in a flavor blend or dispersed in the emulsion. For example, the<br>
manufacturer's product literature on Menthyl Lactate (Frescolat® ML Crystal) from<br>
Symrise (former Haarmann &amp; Reimer GmbH) advises that the product must be<br>
incorporated in a melted state into the oils, fragrances or emulsions at approximately 40-<br>
45 °C (Jacobs et al., Parfümerie und Kosmetik, 1999, Vol. 80, # 4, pp. 26-31). This<br>
added step of melting, of course, adds difficulties during the blending stage. This<br>
melting step, especially in the case of solid materials with higher melting points, such as<br>
WS-3, WS-5, and WS-14, also raises safety concerns. For example, a 25-kg pail of solid<br>
WS-3 with a melting point of about 100°C or just below 100°C, must be placed in a<br>
"hot room," and heated to a temperature equal to or exceeding 100 °C. In turn, the hot<br>
pail containing melted WS-3 has to be handled by personnel, introducing dangerous<br>
opportunities for burn related injuries to occur.<br>
To that end, if the coolant is in the form of a free-flowing powder or crystalline<br>
form, it can be added to the composition as such. However, it is well-known that<br>
blending of a powder or crystalline material can cause inhomogeneity of the final blend.<br>
This is caused by an uneven distribution of the coolant, especially when the final blend is<br>
a solid, a semi-solid, or a viscous liquid. It also raises additional safety concerns due to<br>
the possible formation of explosive mixtures of the particulate dust and air. Therefore,<br>
additional attempts have been made to pre-dissolve the solid coolant agent in an<br>
additional food grade, flavor grade or pharmaceutical grade solvent such as ethanol or<br>
propylene glycol. However, as would be expected, the presence of an additional solvent<br><br>
in the final article is often undesirable. For example, with regard to propylene glycol, its<br>
presence in a final comestible article can impart an undesirable bitter taste nuance.<br>
Currently, literature on solvent-free liquid compositions of physiological cooling<br>
agents is very limited. A recent pre-grant US Patent Application Publication<br>
2004/0018954 (Su et al.) discloses that mixtures of l-menthol and menthyl lactate can be<br>
liquid under normal conditions, which is reasonably explained through a eutectic<br>
mixture. It should be noted that the best effect is achieved at 1:1 weight ratio, where the<br>
crystallization point of the mixture is 8.2 °C. In the winter season, such mixtures would<br>
certainly solidify during shipping and the need for thawing or melting would still exist.<br>
Moreover, these mixtures are based on menthol as the major component which, as<br>
mentioned above, is often undesirable.<br>
Therefore, there is still a need in the art for new and improved physiological<br>
cooling compositions comprising one or more carboxamide class cooling agents, wherein<br>
the composition is capable of existing as a liquid under normal or ambient conditions,<br>
even in the substantial absence of a solvent and even when all of the individual<br>
components of such composition exist as a solid at ambient temperature and atmospheric<br>
pressure, when taken separately.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>

with a suitable alkoxy-containing compound, for example an alkanol (X-OH) in the<br>
presence of an acid according to the following scheme:<br><br><br>
Alternatively, isomeric cyclogeranyl nitriles can be first converted to unsaturated<br>
cyclogeranyl amides and then hydrogenated to compounds of general formula 1d<br>
according to the scheme given below. Unsaturated cyclogeranyl amides shown on the<br>
scheme below also possess cooling activity and can be used instead of their saturated<br>
analogs as components of the blends.<br><br><br>
The at least one cyclohexane carboxamide, or mixture of cyclohexane<br>
carboxamides is preferably incorporated into the composition in an amount in the range<br>
of from about 4% by weight to about 90% by weight of the total physiological coolant<br>
composition, inclusive of all weight percentages and ranges therein. Accordingly, the at<br>

about 5%, 10°/o,15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 35%, 40%, 45%, 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%,<br>

present in the range of from about 10% by weight to about 80% by weight, or from about<br>
20% by weight to about 70% by weight, or even from about 30% by weight to about<br>
60% by weight<br><br>
In one aspect, the acyclic carboxamide comprises N,2,3-trhnethyl-2-isopropyl<br>

trade name of WS-23) having the structure:<br><br>
In another aspect, the acyclic carboxamide according to the invention comprises a<br>
compound of the general structure 2b:<br><br>
wherein the substiruents X1 and R are independently linear or branched alkyl groups as<br>
defined herein. One of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that compounds of the<br>
general structure (2b) above can be obtained commercially, or for example, by a double<br>
alkylation of cyanoacetic esters with isopropyl bromide to give diisopropyl cyanoacetic<br>
ester, followed by a reaction with a suitable alkoxy-containing compound, for example<br>
an alkanol (X1OH) in the presence of an acid according to the scheme:<br><br>
In one more aspect, the acyclic carboxamide according to the invention can<br>
comprise a compound of the structure 2c commonly known as capsaicin:<br>
(2c)<br><br>
Capsaicin is usually isolated from natural sources, wherein it is often present<br>
together with its dihydro derivative dihydrocapsaicin.<br>
The at least one acyclic carboxamide, or a mixture of acyclic carboxamides is<br>
preferably incorporated into the composition in an amount in the range of from about 4%<br>
by weight to about 90% by weight of the total physiological coolant composition,<br>

10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 35%, 40%, 45%, 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80% or<br>

10% by weight to about 80% by weight, or from about 20% by weight to about 70% by<br>
weight, or even from about 30% by weight to about 60% by weight<br>
One of skill in the art will appreciate that the various carboxamides discussed<br>
herein are either commercially available or can be obtained through various known<br>
methods for preparing carboxamides. These methods are known in the art and, therefore,<br>
the reaction mechanisms for providing these carboxamides will not be discussed in detail<br>
herein. However, by way of reference, it should be understood that suitable methods can<br>
include, without limitation, the reaction of the corresponding carboxylic acid<br>
chloroanhydride with a corresponding primary amine such as that disclosed in DE<br>
2,205,255; DE 2,317,538; GB 1,351,761; GB 1,421,744; US 4,150,052; US 4,178,459;<br>
US 4,193,936; US 4,226,988; and US 4,230,688.<br>
Additional suitable methods for the synthesis of carboxamides of the general<br>
formulas 1 and 2 include the reaction of a corresponding nitrile with a corresponding<br>
alkoxy-containing compound in the presence of an acid according to US 6,482,983 and<br>
WO 2003/011816.<br>
And still another suitable method for the synthesis of carboxamides of the general<br>
formulas 1 and 2 includes the reaction of a corresponding nitrile with a corresponding<br>
sulfate compound in the presence of an acid according to US 6,303,817 and WO<br>
2003/011816.<br>
The physiological coolant compositions of the instant invention further comprise<br>
at least one stereoisomer of menthyl lactate, having the general structure (ML):<br><br><br>
In one aspect, the at least one menthyl lactate isomer is the 2S-(1R,2S,5R)-stereoisomer<br>
of the following structural formula ML-2S(1R,2S,5R),<br><br>
Accordingly, the at least one menthyl lactate can comprise the ML-2S-(1R,2S,5R) in<br>
substantially chemically pure form, or, alternatively, can comprise this stereoisomer in<br>
combination with one or more additional stereoisomers of menthyl lactate. In still<br>
another aspect, compositions according to the invention comprise menthyl lactate of the<br>
formula ML as a mixture of its stereoisomers, but significantly enriched in the ML-2S-<br>
(1R,3R,4S) isomer.<br>
The at least one menthyl lactate stereoisomer is preferably incorporated into the<br>
composition in an amount in the range of from about 4% by weight to about 90% by<br>
weight of the total physiological coolant composition, including all weight percentages<br>
and ranges therein. Accordingly, the menthyl lactate can also be present in weight<br>
percentage amounts of about 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 35%, 40%, 45%, 50%,<br>
55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80% or 85% by weight. The at least one stereoisomer of<br>
menthyl lactate can also be present in a weight percentage amount in the range of from<br>
about 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 35%, 40%, 45%, 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%,<br>
75%, 80% or 85% to about 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 35%, 40%, 45%, 50%, 55%,<br>
60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85% or 90%. In still another aspect, the menthyl lactate can<br>
be present in the range of from about 10% by weight to about 80% by weight, or from<br>
about 20% by weight to about 70% by weight, or even from about 30% by weight to<br>
about 60% by weight.<br><br>
One of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that menthyl lactate is<br>
commercially available and can also be readily obtained by a synthesis reaction<br>
comprising a direct esterification of lactic acid with menthol followed by an aqueous<br>
work-up, as illustrated by the following reaction scheme.<br><br>
It should be understood that the physiological coolant compositions of the instant<br>
invention can comprise any desired combination of an at least one acyclic carboxamide,<br>
at least one cyclohexane carboxamide and at least one stereoisomer of menthyl lactate as<br>
disclosed herein. However, in one aspect, the at least one cyclohexane carboxamide<br>
comprises N-ethyl-3-p-menthane carboxamide (WS-3), the at least one acyclic<br>
carboxamide comprises N,2,3-trimethyl-2-isopropyl butanamide (WS-23), and the at<br>
least one menthyl lactate stereoisomer comprises ML-2S-(1R,2S,5R) stereoisomer of<br>
menthyl lactate.<br>
In still another aspect, the physiological cooling compositions of the present<br>
invention exist as a stable liquid under normal or ambient conditions. As used herein,<br>
the term "normal conditions" refers to ambient temperature and atmospheric pressure at<br>
any given time. For example, in one aspect, ambient temperature is in the range of from<br>
approximately 19°C to approximately 25 °C and all temperatures and ranges therein. It<br>
should however be appreciated that in another aspect, the liquid compositions according<br>
to the invention can be used in a spray-dried, co-dried, or microencapsulated form.<br>
In still another aspect, the liquid composition remains a liquid under normal or<br>
ambient conditions upon inflicting a mechanical disturbance and/or seeding with crystals<br>
or powder of one or more individual components of the composition.<br>
In still another aspect, the physiological cooling compositions of the instant<br>
application are substantially solvent free. As used herein, the term "substantially solvent<br>
free" refers to a physiological coolant composition that exists as a stable liquid under<br>
normal conditions irrespective of the presence of a solvent. That is to say that a solvent<br>
is not necessary in order for the physiological coolant composition to retain a liquid state<br>
under normal conditions. To that end, in one aspect, substantially solvent free can be a<br><br>
composition having no more than 10% by weight solvent. Alternatively, substantially<br>
solvent free can be a composition having less than 5% by weight solvent, or less than 2%<br>
by weight solvent; or less than 1% by weight solvent In still another aspect,<br>
substantially solvent free can include a composition that does not contain any solvent.<br>
However, although in one aspect the present invention provides cooling<br>
compositions that are free of solvents, the optional addition of a solvent to the liquid<br>
composition according to the invention does not constitute a departure from the<br>
invention. Non-limiting examples of solvents that can be added include alcohols such as<br>
ethyl alcohol and isopropanol, glycols such as propylene glycol and dipropylene glycol,<br>
glycerin, esters such as ethyl acetate, isopropyl myristate or triacetin, hydrocarbons such<br>
as heptane and petroleum fractions.<br>
In still another aspect, the physiological cooling compositions of the instant<br>
invention are substantially menthol free. As used herein, the term "substantially menthol<br>
free" refers to a physiological coolant composition that does not contain a substantial<br>
amount of menthol. A substantial amount of menthol is defined in one aspect as an<br>
amount that would alter or influence the coolant properties of the composition. In<br>
another aspect, a substantial amount of menthol is defined as an amount that provides<br>
undesirable properties, such as a strong "stinging" smell, a somewhat bitter taste, or<br>
increased volatility. Accordingly, in one aspect, substantially menthol free refers to a<br>
composition comprising an amount of menthol that is less than or equal to about 10% by<br>
weight, or less than or equal to about 5% by weight, or less than or equal to about 3% by<br>
weight, or less than or equal to 2% by weight, or less than or equal to 1% by weight, or<br>
less than or equal to about 0.5% by weight or even about zero percent by weight.<br>
However, the optional addition of menthol to the liquid composition according to<br>
the invention does not constitute a departure from the invention. It should also be noted<br>
that menthol can be present as a non-substantial impurity in commercial batches and<br>
samples of menthyl lactate. Accordingly, a non-substantial impurity, in one aspect, is an<br>
impurity present in an amount that is less than or equal to about 10% by weight, less than<br>
or equal to about 5% by weight, less than or equal to about 3% by weight, less than or<br>
equal to 2% by weight, less than or equal to 1% by weight, less than or equal to about<br>
0.5% by weight or even about zero percent by weight. Therefore, in one aspect, the<br>
presence of a non-substantial amount of menthol in the composition according to the<br>
invention can be reasonably expected.<br><br>
As illustrated by the appended examples, in another aspect, the compositions of<br>
the instant application surprisingly provide a synergistic cooling effect, i.e. a cooling<br>
strength of the mixture that noticeably exceeds a total of the individual cooling strengths<br>
of its components. This aspect can provide the added benefit of a potential cost savings<br>
by decreasing the necessary loading of the composition into a final blend an/or a<br>
consumer product.<br>
In another aspect, the present invention further provides a method for producing<br>
the physiological cooling compositions described herein. Accordingly, in one aspect, the<br>
method comprises the steps of a) providing at least one cyclohexane carboxamide of the<br>
general structure (1), at least one acyclic carboxamide of the general structure (2), and at<br>
least one stereoisomer of menthyl lactate of the formula (ML); b) blending the at least<br>
one cyclohexane carboxamide, at least one acyclic carboxamide and at least one menthyl<br>
lactate together under conditions effective to provide a physiological cooling<br>
composition as disclosed herein.<br>
In one aspect, the conditions effective to provide a physiological cooling<br>
composition comprise co-melting and/or kneading the mixture of the cyclohexane<br>
carboxamide, acyclic carboxamide and menthyl lactate to provide a liquid physiological<br>
cooling composition as disclosed herein. Alternatively, in another aspect, the individual<br>
components can be melted independently and then blended together in their respective<br>
liquid states to provide the physiological cooling composition.<br>
In still another aspect, the compositions of the present invention can be used in<br>
any consumer good capable of using a cooling agent. In one aspect, the liquid<br>
compositions according to the invention are suitable for human consumption. In another<br>
aspect, the consumer goods are suitable for topical application to mammalian skin,<br>
including without limitation, human as well as veterinary applications. More specific<br>
examples of consumer goods include, without limitation, flavor blends, foods, cosmetic<br>
preparations, confectionery, soft and alcoholic beverages, chewing gums, toothpaste,<br>
dental floss, mouthwash, anti-plaque, anti-gingivitis compositions, shampoos,<br>
antidandruff shampoos, lotions, deodorants, after shave lotions, shaving gels, shaving<br>
aid composites, fragrances, skin sanitizing compositions, throat lozenges, throat drops,<br>
chewable antacid tablets, or pharmaceutical compositions or medications, including anti-<br>
inflammatory compositions, compositions for treatment of nasal symptoms, for upper<br>
gastrointestinal tract distress, for treating cold symptoms, for cough relief, for alleviating<br>
discomfort of hot flash, or for foot therapy, and the like.<br><br>
It should also be understood that the compositions according to the instant<br>
invention can be used in combination with accessory compounds that facilitate the<br>
incorporation of the components of the composition into the above mentioned consumer<br>
goods. Examples of such accessory compounds include, but are not limited to, solvents<br>
such as ethanol or propylene glycol, control release agents or gel-forming agents, such as<br>
hydroxyalkyl cellulose or starch, modified starch, and various carriers such as<br>
amorphous silica, alumina, or activated carbon.<br>
One of ordinary skill in the art would know how to incorporate the composition<br>
of the instant invention into a consumer good.<br>
EXPERIMENTAL<br>
The following examples are put forth so as to provide those of ordinary skill in<br>
the art with a complete disclosure and description of how the compositions according to<br>
the invention, and associated processes and methods are obtained, used, and/or<br>
evaluated, and are intended to be purely exemplary of the invention and are not intended<br>
to limit the scope of what the inventors regard as their invention. Efforts have been<br>
made to ensure accuracy with respect to numbers (e.g. amounts, temperature, etc;) and<br>
taste and cooling strength evaluations, but some errors and deviations should be<br>
accounted for. Unless indicated otherwise, parts are parts by weight, temperature is in<br>
°C (Celsius) or is at ambient temperature, and pressure is at or near atmospheric.<br>
The aqueous solutions of products for organoleptic tests were obtained by<br>
dissolving appropriate amounts of the products in propylene glycol PG and adding the<br>
PG solution to an appropriate amount of water.<br>

Illustration of synergistic cooling effect of the compositions of the invention<br>
A. Cooling strength values for individual coolants. Cooling strength values used<br>
in this invention for individual coolants were those generally accepted in the art and also<br>
additionally confirmed using expert evaluations conducted by Millennium Specialty<br>
Chemicals personnel on the basis of a sequential dilution method, i.e., a controlled<br>
dilution of samples to the concentration where their strength is about equal to the<br>
standard solution of WS-3. For purposes of Examples 55-60, a 10 ppm solution of WS-3<br>
in water was used as the standard solution and was assigned a standardized cooling<br>
strength value of 10.0. The corresponding relative cooling strengths for the individual<br>
cooling agents were men assigned based upon an organoleptic determination of the<br>
approximate concentration of cooling agent that was required to provide about the same<br>
cooling strength as the standardized 10 ppm solution of WS-3.<br>
Accordingly, the following cooling strengths were assigned to the cooling agents<br>
as follows: highly purified WS-5 had a relative cooling strength of about 16.7; WS-3<br>
was assigned a cooling strength of 10.0; WS-23 had a relative cooling strength of about<br>
5.0; Menthyl Lactate had a relative cooling strength of about 2.9; WS-14 had a relative<br>
cooling strength of about 5.0; WS-30 had a relative cooling strength of about 1.5,<br><br>
N,2,2,6-Tetramethylcyclohexane-l-carboxamide had a relative cooling strength of about<br>
1.0, and MMG had a relative cooling strength of about 3.5.<br>
B. Measurement of the cooling strength of the compositions. Aqueous solutions<br>
were prepared of compositions of coolants obtained in inventive examples 32, 35, 37,44,<br>
45, and 52. Each solution contained 10 ppm concentration of the total composition.<br>
These solutions were organoleptically tested using a scale from 0 (zero) to 10 of the<br>
cooling strength in comparison with the standard solution of 10 ppm of WS-3 in water,<br>
which was assigned a score of 10.0.<br>
The mathematically expected scores (ES) were calculated according to the following<br>
formula:<br>
(ES) - [CS1(A%:100) + CS2 (B%:100) + CS3(C%:100)]<br>
wherein CS1, CS2 and CS3 represent the individual cooling strength for the cyclohexane<br>
carboxamide, acyclic carboxamide and menthyl lactate respectively, and wherein A%,<br>
B%, and C% represent the individual weight percentages for the cyclohexane<br>
carboxamide, acyclic carboxamide and menthyl lactate respectively present in the<br>
composition.<br>
Comparative Results for various 10 ppm solutions of the compositions according<br>
to the invention are given in Table 10 below.<br><br>
Throughout this application, various publications are referenced. The disclosures<br>
of these publications in their entireties are hereby incorporated by reference into this<br>

variations can be made in the present invention without departing from the scope or spirit<br><br>
of the invention. Other embodiments of the invention will be apparent to those skilled in<br>
the art from consideration of the specification and practice of the invention disclosed<br>
herein. It is intended that the specification and examples be considered as exemplary<br>
only, with a true scope and spirit of the invention being indicated by the following<br>
claims.<br><br>

range 19°C to 25°C.<br><br><br><br>
ABSTRACT<br><br>
PHYSIOLOGICAL COOLING COMPOSITIONS<br>
The invention provides a physiological cooling composition consisting of from 20 to 55 wt. %<br>
of a cyclohexane carboxamide selected from the group consisting of N-ethyl-3-p-menthane<br>
carboxamide, N-(ethoxycarbonylmethyl)-3-p-menthane carboxamide, and mixtures thereof; from 15 to<br>
45 wt. % of N,2,3-trimethyl-2-isopropyl butanamide; and from 20 to 55 wt. % of menthyl lactate,<br>
wherein the composition is a stable liquid at atmospheric pressure and at a temperature in the range<br>
19°C to 25°C. Being a liquid the physiological cooling compositions of the invention can be<br>
formulated easily with an even distribution. The physiological cooling compositions of the invention<br>
have good cooling properties. As they do not contain menthol they avoid the disadvantages of menthol<br>
such as a strong smell and a somewhat bitter taste.</td>
