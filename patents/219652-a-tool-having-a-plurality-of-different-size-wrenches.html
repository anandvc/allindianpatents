				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a tool having a plurality of different size wrenches.<br>
PRIOR ART<br>
Wrenches are known in the art and which comprise an insert or a lever with a hex wrench of a first size provided with a head member only at one end or a hex wrench of a differnet size provided with a head member at the opposite end. Several distinct disadvantages are assocaited is that as each tool had only two sizes of a wrench, it was necessary to provide a plurality of such tools to constitute a set of wrenches. Yet another disadvantage was that such tools had a wrench either in a millimieter or inch size, and not a combination thereof. A further disadvantage is that such tools were easily misplaced.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
An object of this invention is to propose a novel construction of tool having a plurality of different size wrenches.<br>
Another object of this invention is to propose a tool having a plurality of different size wrenches at one or both ends.<br><br>
Yet another object of this invention is to propose a tool which is versatile.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THIS INVENTION<br>
According to this invention there is provided a tool having a plurality of different size wrenches comprising insert or handle characterized in that a head at each end of the handle securedly held thereto wherein the central longitudinal axis of said head being coincident with the central longitudinal axis of the handle and said heads having a plurality of wrenches of different sizes provided integrally therewith.<br>
Specifically, in accordance with this invention but without implying any limitation thereto, the tool comprises an insert or handle having a head at opposite ends thereof. A head member is integrally provided at either end of said handle or insert. Each head member has wrenches of different sizes. Thus, the head member has a set of different size wrenches in accordance with a first measurement, such as millimeters. The opposite head member has wrenches of different sizes in accordance with a second measurement, such as inches.<br>
In accordance with another embodiment of this invention, a head member with different size wrenches is provided only at one end.<br>
In accordance with yet another embodiment  of this  invention the tool comprises an insert to  consist<br>
of  three  handle  disposed at an  inclination  to each other.   A  head  is provided at the free  end  of  each<br>
handle.   The  head member is  integrally  or  securedly provided  at said end .of each handle.  Each head  member<br>
has wrenches of different sizes.  Thus, the head  member has a set of different size wrenches in accordance  with<br>
a  first  measurement, such as millimeters.   The  other head   member  has  wrenches  of  different   sizes   in<br>
accordance  with a second measurement, such  as  inches. The  third  head  member has a  wrench  of  yet  another<br>
different size.<br>
The handles are disposed at an inclination of 120° to each other.<br>
Further   objects  and  advantages  of   this<br>
invention  will  be  more  apparent   from  the  ensuing description   when   read  in   conjunction   with   the<br>
accompanying drawings and wherein:<br>
Fig.1       shows the multi wrench in accordance  with one embdoiment of this invention;<br>
and Fig.2   shows another embodiment of the multi wrench of the present invention.<br>
Referring   to   the   drawings,   and   with<br>
particular  reference  to  Fig.l, the wrench  1  of  the<br>
present  invention    comprises an insert or  handle 2 having a head 3a at one end and a second head 3b at  the<br>
opposite end thereof.  The central longitudinal axis of handle 2 and head members 3a and 3b are coincident  with<br>
each other.<br>
As the construction of head 3a is   identical<br>
to  that  of head 3b, and for purposes of  brevity,  the construction  of head 3a is only described.  As will  be<br>
apparent, head 3a has a first wrench 4a for a first  set of  sizes.  Head 3a has a second wrench 5a for a  second<br>
set of sizes.  Head 3a has a third wrench 6a for a third set of sizes.  Thus, as will be apparent, each head  has<br>
three different set of wrenches and each wrench has set of  two sizes in distinction to a single size wrench  of<br>
the known art.  Wrenches 4a to 6a are disposed  at right angles to each other.<br>
As  described  hereinabove,  head  3b  has  a<br>
construction  identical  to head 3a.  However,  head  3a could  have  wrench size in millimeters and head  3b  in<br>
inches.  Alternatively, head 3a could have wrench  sizes different to those of head 3b.<br>
Reference   is  now  made  to   Fig.2  which illustrates   another   embodiment   of   a   tool    10 substantially  identical to that of tool 1, except  that tool  10 has three inserts lla to lie each  disposed  at 120° to  each other. Each of inserts   have  similarly three heads 13a to 13c, each head having a plurality of wrenches.<br>
Reverting  to  Fig.l, reference  is  made  to<br>
wrenches 4a to 6a.  Each of wrenches 4a to 6a consist of<br>
a  plurality  of  wrenches.   Thus, and  as  by  way  of<br>
example, wrench 4a consists of a wrenches 4al and 4a2 of<br>
different  sizes.   Similarly,  wrench  5a  consists  of<br>
wrenches Sal and 5a2 and wrench 6a consists of  wrenches<br>
6al  and  6a2.   Thus,  head  3a  has  wrenches  of  six<br>
different sizes.<br>
Head  3b  similarly has  wrenches 4b  to  6b.<br>
Each wrench has a set of wrenches.  Thus, wrench  4b has<br>
a  set of  wrenches 4bl and 4b2, wrench 5 has a  set  of<br>
wrenches 5bl and 5b2 and wrench 6b has wrenches 6bl  and<br>
6b2.<br><br><br><br><br>
WE CLAIM;<br>
1.	A tool having a plurality of different size wrenches comprising insert or<br>
handle (2 and 1 la-11 c)characterized in that a head (3a and 3b, 13a-13c)<br>
at each end of the handle securedly held thereto wherein the central<br>
longitudinal   axis  of  said   head   being  coincident  with   the   central<br>
longitudinal axis of the handle and said heads having a plurality of<br>
wrenches of different sizes provided integrally therewith.<br>
2.	A tool as claimed in claim 1 wherein a head (3a and 3b) is provided at<br>
opposite ends of said handle and the central longitudinal axis of said<br>
two heads being coincident to each other.<br>
3.	A tool as claimed in claim 1 comprising three inserts (1 la-lie) having a<br>
head (13a-13c) at each end thereof.<br>
4.	A tool as claimed in claim 3 wherein the inserts or handles are disposed<br>
at an angle of 120° to each other.<br>
5.	A tool as claimed in claim  1 wherein each head has atleast three<br>
wrenches having different sizes therein.<br>
6.	A tool as claimed in claim 5 wherein said wrenches are disposed at an<br>
angle of 90° to the adjacent wrench.<br>
7.	A tool substantially as herein described and illustrated with reference to<br>
