				<td>A PLECTRUM<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a plectrum for picking or strumming the strings of a musical<br>
Instrument. In particular, it relates to a plectrum for holding between the thumb and finger.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Plectrums, or picks, for a stringed Instrument, such as a guitar, banjo, harp and the like,<br>
have long been used as an alternative to one's fingernails to pick or strum the strings.<br>
These plectrums are useful devices for a user who wishes to play a stringed instrument.<br>
Typically, a user chooses a plectrum according to its characteristics, type of strings used<br>
on the instrument, and his style and technique of playing.<br>
A common plectrum Is a flat piece of material, which may be made from plastics, wood,<br>
bone, shell, metal or any other suitable material. Plastic plectrums have become very<br>
common In usage and Its suitability for use with nylon strings further make them popular.<br>
Metal plectrums are hard and rigid, and are mostly suitable for metal strings. These<br>
materials have their own characteristic stiffness and are used to produce different tones<br>
and texture of sounds.<br>
Conventional plectrums are also made in various shapes. The typical shapes are<br>
triangular or oval (or melon-seed or tear-drop shapes). There are three factors that affect<br>
the characteristic sound a plectrum may produce: the gripping point between the thumb<br>
and finger; the distance of the playing edge from the'gripplng point; and the thickness at<br>
the playing edges.<br>
The problem with a flat plectrum is the difficulty of having a good grip between the thumb<br>
and finger. This affects the accuracy of picking the individual strings of the musical<br>
instrument. To overcome this problem of providing a good grip, especially for a plastic<br>
moulded plectrum, the prior art has shown the use of knurling or texturing the gripping<br>
point. Another method is to provide an aperture at the gripping point By providing a good<br>
grip on the plectrum, this enables the user to accurately pick the string to produce a<br>
particular note and allows him to express his style and technique of playing confidently.<br>
The size of a plectrum is another factor. There is a trade off between the size and ease of<br>
gripping a plectrum. A large plectrum provides a larger gripping area but its size impedes<br>
the agile pivoting of the plectrum between the thumb and finger. On the other hand, the<br>
gripping area of a smaller plectrum Is limited although the smaller size provides better<br>
dexterity to the user.<br>
These conventional plectrums are commonly described as "thick", "medium" and 'thin*<br>
with thickness of substantially 1, 0.7 and 0.5 mm respectively. For example, for use in<br>
playing a guitar, a "thick" plectrum produces louder and more powerful sounds, such as<br>
for solo or lead roles. A "thin" plectrum produces a gentle and soft sound, such as for<br>
acoustical background sound. The "medium* thick plectrum may be used for normal or<br>
common sounds.<br>
A typical plectrum has a limited number of playing edges. A playing edge is often located<br>
at an end of the plectrum. When a variety of tones or sounds are required, the user is<br>
required to alternate between a number of playing edges available on a plectrum.<br>
Otherwise, he will have to change to a different plectrum whilst playing the instrument.<br>
This may be necessary when the user desires to produce sound texture, ranging from, for<br>
example, heavy-metal rock type to the soothing strum of the 12-string acoustic guitar.<br>
The plectrum of this invention aims at overcoming or at least alleviate some of the above<br>
shortcomings or problems of conventional plectrums. An aim is to provide the user with<br>
control and variety in the generation of the tone and quality of a stringed musical<br>
instrument with the aid of a plectrum.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
Referring to the accompanying drawings, Fig. 1 shows a perspective view of a plectrum<br>
1. The plectrum 1 comprises two portions 10 and 12, respectively. The two portions 10<br>
and 12 are not coplanar but rather are offset transversely by a distance substantially the<br>
thickness of the plectrum 1. These two portions 10 and 12 are connected by an integrally<br>
formed step member 14. This step member 14 is in the shape of an arc, with the vertex of<br>
the arc extending Into the first portion 10.<br>
Portion 10 has two corners 114 and 118 opposed to each other, while portion 12 has an<br>
oval (or melon-seed or tear-drop) shape comer 112 distal from the other comers 114,<br>
118. These corners define three of the playing edges 112, 114, 118 for engaging the<br>
strings of a musical instrument However, further playing edges will be described below.<br>
Playing edge 112 Is oblong or oval shaped and has a rounded tip. This edge 112 is<br>
suitable for common play and is used for strumming and picking of individual strings, both<br>
in the up and down stroke movement. Pointed playing edge 114 is sharper than edge 112<br>
and is suitable for fast picking. Edge 118 is another pointed edge like 114 but is joined up<br>
with a jagged or scallop shaped playing edge 116.<br>
The arched step 14 creates a recessed surface 102. When In use, for example edge 112<br>
to engage the strings of a musical instrument, 102 defines the gripping area for the thumb<br>
and the corresponding area on the reverse side of plectrum 1 for the forefinger. At this<br>
gripping position, the curve at the back of the thumb's ball fits comfortably against the<br>
curved step 14 (as shown In Rg. 2). This curved step 14 provides the thumb a firm and<br>
positive grip on plectrum 1. Similarly, the curved step on the reverse side of plectrum 1<br>
also provides the finger with a positive grip. With the provision of a firmer grip, the user is<br>
able to pivot the plectrum 1 between the thumb and finger easily each time he alternates<br>
between the upstroke and downstroke picking/strumming.<br>
When using pointed edge 114 to engage the strings, the gripping area is located, for<br>
instance, at 103. The distance of edge 114 from gripping point 103 is shorter than that of<br>
112 from 102. This makes comer 114 more stiff and, therefore, edge 114 Is suitable for<br>
fast picking and produces louder sound, such as for solo play. At this gripping position<br>
103, the front curve of the thumb fits with the curved step 14, which provides a positive<br>
grip for the thumb. Pointed playing edge 114 at this comer of plectrum 1 is also designed<br>
for edge 114 to be held at an ideal angle of 30 degrees with the strings for fast picking<br>
and also for producing clear intonations.<br>
Scallop shaped edge 116 comprises at least three small curved edges 117. These<br>
constituent edges 117 form a convex profile to edge 116. When using this edge 116 for<br>
strumming the strings, each string Is strummed more than once on each stroke and<br>
produces multiple sounds like that of a 12-strings guitar. Edge 116 is also used to<br>
produce a variety of strumming sounds, such as giving a more treble effect Edge 116<br>
provides good contact with the strings and is suitable for strumming both nylon and steel<br>
stringed instruments.<br>
The scallop shaped edge 116 ends with a further pointed playing edge 118. Edges 116<br>
and 118 are proximate to each other and provide a user a choice of strumming the strings<br>
with both edges 116,118 or with only edge 118. By having a flrm grip at position 104, for<br>
example, provided by the curve edge 14, a user Is able to pivot the plectrum 1 about his<br>
thumb and finger and this gives him the freedom to combine the effect of edges 116 and<br>
118 with relative ease. When edge 118 Is strummed with the plectrum 1 at ah angle with<br>
a string and at the same time allowing edge 116 to touch the string, an artificial muted<br>
harmonics Is produced.<br>
Step edge member 14 ends with a Z-profile on both sides of plectrum 1. The edges 120,<br>
120' of the Z-profile Is suitable for tugging the strings of a musical instrument This<br>
provides an alternative to the practice of pinching the strings with one's fingers to produce<br>
a popping or slapping sound effect.<br>
The surface at each of the gripping points 102,103,104 may have a concave depression<br>
or a convex protrusion to provide further grip for the thumb or finger.<br>
With a choice of playing points 112, -114,116,118,120,120' to select from, plectrum 1<br>
provides the user flexibility in playing a stringed instrument Step edge 14 also provides a<br>
reference for a user to move his gripping point when different playing edges are<br>
alternately being used. This helps him to locate the precise playing points to use quickly<br>
and accurately. For example, after playing with edge 112, he can rotate plectrum 1 with<br>
his fingers and thumb and with the feel of step edge 14, move his gripping point to<br>
position 103, for example, and use playing edge 114 with relative ease and precision.<br>
This feature is especially helpful to the user for fast play.<br>
Plectrum 1 of this invention also allows flexible control by holding the plectrum 1 between<br>
the thumb and finger, as compared to those that are worn on the thumb or finger. This<br>
allows the user to control the angle of inclination to the strings during the up-stroke or<br>
down-stroke picking/strumming. This also allows the user to pivot the plectrum 1 about<br>
the gripping point and thus relieves the finger of having to contort Itself. The freedom of<br>
pivoting about the gripping point between the thumb and finger and the alternating use of<br>
the front and back faces of a playing edge also allows the musician to express his own<br>
style and technique of playing, and combination of tone desired.<br>
With a stepped edge 14, plectrum 1 is not flat and can easily be picked up from the table<br>
or from Inside its holder.<br>
Plectrum 1 has a size of substantially 30 mm from the rounded playing edge 112 to the<br>
jagged edge 116, and of substantially 28 mm from the pointed playing edge 114 to edge<br>
118. Plectrum 1 Is made of plastic and is suitable for manufacturing, for instance, by<br>
plastic injection moulding. Plectrum 1 is also manufactured with thickness of about 1, 0.7<br>
and 0.5 mm and are described as "thick", "medium" and "thin" respectively.<br>
The same numerical reference numbers have been preserved to denote the features that<br>
are in common with the first and subsequent embodiments. Alphabet a, b and so on may<br>
be added to differentiate similar features in the embodiments..<br>
