The invention relates to a carding machine with a feed roller.<br>
From US-P 3,955,244 a carding machine is known with a feed roller and an opening cylinder, which features a plurality of dirt separation apertures. The dirt separation area is essentially divided into two. While in the first part, following the feed roller, a large aperture is provided for the separation of coarse dirt, this is followed by an area in which a number of rods are arranged at a distance from one another. The gaps between the bars serve in particular to separate out finer dirt particles. Arranged beneath the dirt separation apertures is a chamber which is adjustable in terms of its position in relation to the dirt separation apertures. The corresponding air inlet apertures can as ~ result be altered in their position. As a result of the arrangement of air inlet apertures in US-P 3,955,244, through which the inlet air is conducted very close to the dirt separation apertures, in particular to the bars of the second dirt separation area, the risk pertains that the inlet air flow will influence the dirt separation. This may happen as a result of the air flow not adopting the anticipated route in the direction of the suction extraction channel, but being conducted into the area of the opening cylinder, and accordingly prevents the separation of fine dirt particles in particular due to the counterflow which is induced. The cleaning of dirt particles from the fibres is accordingly unsatisfactory.<br>
Fiber-guiding wedge for carders is known from EP 0 909 843. Method and apparatus for removing waste settling under carding machine or the like is known from US 4,087,888. Method and apparatus for separating waste from a fiber-and-waste mixture IS known from US 4,379,357. Process for the separation of waste on a cotton and cotton card is known from DE 3821 771.<br>
From EP 0 239 549 Al a carding machine is known in which a catchment trough is arranged beneath all the rollers, for the dirt separated out from all the rollers. Provided in about the middle of the trough is a suction device, by means of which the collected dirt can be conducted away. In order to prevent the dirt from collecting on the floor of the trough, an air flow is created which functions like a pneumatic dirt conveyor belt. Flaps are arranged in each case at the side walls of the trough, which allow, through an optional opening, inflows of ambient air with differing intensity. As a result of this,<br><br>
depending on the incidence of dirt, a more or less dense flow carpet can be created on the floor of the trough, in order to guarantee removal. Due to the necessary size of the trough, however, it is difficult to achieve an appropriate degree of suction so as in fact to guarantee the pneumatic removal of the dirt. In addition to this, a very high suction capacity is required in order to provide the complete area with a sufficient flow at all times which will guarantee the movement of the dirt.<br>
In PCT 1080259- provision is made for a dirt separation aperture at which a channel is arranged to carry off the impurities. The channel features a dirt catchment zone and an air inflow zone. The dirt separation is indeed already very good thanks to the known design, but the ever higher demands on carding machines and the ever increasing requirement for quality of the fibre bundles produced by them means that the separation of even finer dirt particles is constantly becoming more important, with, at the same time, the removal of as little good fibre as possible.<br>
The problem of the present invention is therefore of improving the quality of the fibre bundles manufactured on carding machines with regard to dirt separation, and in particular with regard to the completeness of the dirt separation, and with regard to extremely fine particles as well, and to avoid the disadvantages of the prior art described heretofore.<br>
The problem is resolved by a carding machine as described herein.<br>
Accordingly the invention provides a carding machine with a feed roller, wherein the feed roller delivers the fibre material in the form of lap to an opening cylinder, a dirt separation aperture is provided in the area of the opening cylinder to separate the fibres and impurities at the dirt separafion aperture, a channel is arranged at the dirt separation aperture to draw off the impurities, and whereby the channel features a dirt separation zone and an air inlet flow zone, characterised in that the dirt separation zone is arranged in the area of the dirt separation aperture and the air inlet flow zone is turned away from the dirt separation aperture, and that between the dirt separation zone and the air inlet flow zone a partition wall is provided, in order to prevent to a large extent any influence on the dirt transfer by the inlet air flow.<br><br>
The effect of the partition wall is that the dirt removal zone is entirely uninfluenced by the inlet air. The dirt separation takes place largely by centrifugal force, the effect of which is that the dirt particles are centrifuged away from the opening cylinder and conducted to the dirt removal zone and the corresponding channel section. The channel, which in particular is arranged directly at the dirt separation aperture, accordingly requires a relatively low inlet air flow in comparison with the prior art, in order to be able to remove the separated dirt particles from the channel. Even low flows already have the effect of ensuring the removal of the dirt particles via a suction system.<br>
Due to the partition wall, the inlet airflow first takes effect at a relatively large distance from the dirt separation aperture in the channel in relation to the separated dirt particles. In view of the fact that, as a result of this, no air can pass from the inlet air flow into the area of the dirt separation aperture, the separation of even the smallest dirt particles is rendered possible via the dirt separation aperture due to the centrifugal force which takes effect on them. It is assured by the invention that the air inlet flow does not pass into the area of the opening cylinder and therefore exert any force on the dirt particles which might counteract the centrifugal force and possibly even neutralise it.<br>
If the dirt separation aperture is delimited by a particularly sharp separation edge, for preference by a separation blade, then a sharp separation of the dirt particles from the good fibres at the opening cylinder is guaranteed. Thanks to this measure, it is possible for even fine dirt particles to be separated out and for good fibres to be trapped at the outlet into the channel. The effectiveness of the dirt separation is thereby substantially increased.<br>
To advantage, the separation blade delimits the channel. In particular, the separation blade is a part of the wall of the dirt removal zone and accordingly brings about the uninterrupted entry of the dirt particles into the dirt removal zone of the channel, the avoidance of dirt contamination of the dirt removal zone, and a precise separation between good fibres and dirt particles.<br><br>
If the partition wall is arranged between the separation blade and the outer wall of the air inlet flow zone, then the design of the channel according to the invention can be resolved very simply and economically.<br>
If the partition wall is designed to be adjustable in its position in respect of the dirt removal zone and/or the air inlet flow zone, then it is possible to exert an influence on different fibre material and different operational settings of the carding machine in respect of the dirt separation. It is therefore possible for the volume of the inlet air flow and/or the resistance of the dirt particles to be influenced during separation. In particular, the resistance to separation of the dirt particles is important, since it is by means of this that the retention of the good fibres on the opening cylinder is influenced. The discharge of the dirt particles will be prevented on the one hand if the air inlet flow passes into the area of the separation aperture. On the other hand, it may happen, if the dirt removal zone features too little resistance, that good fibres are removed. In order to find the optimum setting in this situation, which is dependent on the fibre material and the operafional settings of the carding machine, the posifioning capability of the partition wall is of particular advantage.<br>
If the partition wall is rotatable about an axis, then the adjustment described heretofore of the position of the partition wall is very easy to effect.<br>
If the axis is arranged at the end of the partition wall which is turned towards the feed roller or the opening cylinder respectively, then the adjustment of the position of the partifion wall will simultaneously alter the air inlet flow zone and the dirt removal zone of the channel. If the inlet airflow is increased, then the outlet aperture will simultaneously be reduced. As a result of this, a user-friendly and foolproof adjustment can be guaranteed.<br>
If the channel is connected to a sucfion device, and in particular to a central suction system, then the collected dirt is to be removed in a dirt trap container.<br>
The suction device, which is connected to a pneumatic conveying device for the dirt, ensures in this situation that no deposits of dirt are formed in the channel system which<br><br>
would lead to additional maintenance and cleaning work, as well as to worse fibre cleaning results.<br>
To advantage, the feed roller interacts with a feed trough, which is arranged at the side turned away from the channel. As a result of this, it is possible to bring the channel as far as close to the opening cylinder, in particular into the area of the feed roller. The separation of both large as well as small dirt particles can therefore be reliably guaranteed.<br>
If the section of the channel forming the dirt removal zone is designed to be essentially perpendicular, this will avoid the separated dirt collecting inside this part of the channel. With such a design of the channel, the dirt falls into the area in which it is taken up by the air inlet flow and carried on further. Due to the vertical arrangement of this part of the channel, the speed of the separated dirt particles is also maintained, which ensures the movement of the dirt particles until the removal of the particles into a central suction system is guaranteed. This effect is further enhanced by the process air flow emerging from the opening cylinder and the dirt separation aperture.<br>
To advantage, the air inlet zone is arranged at an acute angle to the dirt removal zone of the channel. As a result of this, an injector effect is achieved, on the principle of a venturi nozzle, as a result of which the dirt is actively brought out of the dirt removal zone into the channel area after the partition wall. This also supports a reliable and effective dirt separation of both large and small dirt particles.<br>
Further advantages are explained in the following embodiment by may of example. Figure 1 of the accompanying drawing shows a section from a carding machine with the dirt separation method according to the invention.<br>
In the intake area of the fibres, not shown, into the carding machine, provision is made for a feed trough 1, which interacts with a feed roller 2. Between the feed trough 1 and the feed roller 2 the fibre tufts are transferred in the form of a fleece to an opening cylinder 3, also referred to as the licker-in or taker-in. The opening cylinder 3 separates the fibres<br><br>
introduced into individual fibre strands. Together with the fibres the impurities contained in the fleece are also fed to the feed roller 2 and the opening cylinder 3. Due to the centrifugal forces at work on them these impurities are centrifuged out at the opening cylinder 3 from the opening cylinder 3, or at least, due to their mass, are raised further from the opening cylinder 3 than the lighter or more inert good fibres. The separation of the dirt particles from the good fibres is also favoured by a separation blade 4, which delimits a dirt separation aperture 5 in the housing 6 of the opening cylinder.<br>
After the release of the dirt particles from the opening cylinder 3, they pass through the dirt separation aperture 5 into a channel 7. The channel 7 is subdivided at its beginning into a dirt transfer zone 8 and an air inlet flow zone 9. The separation blade 4 in this situation forms a part of the wall of the dirt transfer zone 8 and is turned away from the air inlet flow zone 9.<br>
Arranged between the dirt transfer zone 8 and the air inlet flow zone 9 is a partition wall 10. The partition wall 10 extends from the feed roller 2 as far as an area of the channel 7 removed at a distance from the dirt separation aperture 5. The effect of this is that the air inflow, which is introduced into the channel 7 from the air inlet flow zone 9, takes effect as far as possible from the dirt separation aperture 5. The dirt separation zone 8 forms a part of the channel 7, which is designed to be essentially horizontal. The separated dirt particles in this situation fall through the dirt transfer zone 8, due simply to their own weight, into the area of the channel 7, in which the air inflow takes effect. There the dirt is conducted as far as a suction system 11, from where the dirt can be disposed of via a central suction system or a local dirt collection device. An important factor in this situation is that no dirt accumulations occur within the channel system, since this would lead to elaborate and additional maintenance expenditure. Due to the vertical design of the channel 7 in the area of the dirt separation zone 8, deposits of dirt particles inside this zone are already prevented by the design of the channel 7 alone.<br>
In order to exert an influence on the intake air flow and the dirt separation, provision is made for the partition wall 10 to be adjustable, or capable of being moved in its position to<br><br><br><br><br><br>
