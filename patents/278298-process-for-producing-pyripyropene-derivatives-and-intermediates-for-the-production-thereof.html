				<td>SPECIFICATION<br>
PROCESS FOR PRODUCING PYRIPYROPENE DERIVATIVES AND INTERMEDIATES FOR THE PRODUCTION THEREOF<br>
CROSS-REFERENCE OF RELATED APPLICATION<br>
[0001]<br>
This patent application is an application claiming priority based on a prior Japanese Patent Application, Japanese Patent Application No. 210804/2007 (filing date: August 13, 2007). The whole disclosure of Japanese Patent Application No. 210804/2007 is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002] Field of Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a process for producing pyripyropene derivatives useful as pest control agents and more specifically relates to a process for producing pyripyropene derivatives that have acyloxy groups at the 1- and 11-positions and a hydroxyl group at the 7-position thereof.<br>
[0003] Background Art<br>
Pyripyropene derivatives having acyloxy at 1- and 11-positions and hydroxyl at the 7-position thereof are compounds that have control effects against pests, as descR1bed in WO 2006/129714.<br>
[0004]<br>
WO 2006/129714 and Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 259569/1996 disclose a process for producing pyripyropene derivatives having acyloxy at 1- and 11-positions and hydroxyl at the 7-position thereof. According to the production process, the pyripyropene derivatives are purified or isolated from a plurality of products produced by nonselective hydrolysis of acyloxy using a 1,7,11-triacyloxy compound as a starting compound.    This production process, however, suffers<br>
from problems such as low yield and unsuitability for quantity synthesis.<br>
[0005]<br>
Further, Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 259569/1996 descR1bes the use of a combination of protective groups for the synthesis of pyripyropene derivatives, and Journal of Antibiotics Vol. 49, No. 11, p. 1149, 1996, Bioorganic Medicinal Chemistry Letter Vol. 5, No. 22, p. 2683, 1995, Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 269065/1996, and WO 2008/013336 disclose a synthesis example that introduces acyl into the 7-position by utilizing a protective group. These documents, however, do not disclose a specific process that utilizes a protective group in the production of pyripyropene derivatives that have acyloxy at the 1- and 11-positions and hydroxyl at the 7-position thereof.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0006]<br>
The present inventors have found that pyripyropene derivatives having acyloxy groups at the 1- and 11-positions and a hydroxyl group at the 7-position thereof can be produced at high yield from pyripyropene A (Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 259569/1996; Bioorganic Medicinal Chemistry Letter Vol. 5, No. 22, p. 2683, 1995; and WO2004/060065) which is obtained as a naturally occurring substance, by using a proper protective group.

The present invention is further illustrated by the following Examples that are not intended as a limitation of the invention.<br>
[0092] Example 1: Synthesis of 7-deacetylpyripyropene A<br>
Pyripyropene A (30 mg) was dissolved in an 80% aqueous methanol solution (2 ml_). 1,8-Diazabicyclo[5.4.0]-undeca-7-ene (9 mg) was added to the solution, and the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 1.5 hr. Acetic acid was added to the reaction solution to stop the reaction. The solvent was then removed by evaporation under the reduced pressure, water was added to the residue, and the mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate. The ethyl acetate layer was washed with saturated brine and was dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. The solvent was then removed by evaporation under the reduced pressure to give a crude product of 7-deacetylpyripyropene A. The crude product was purified by preparative thin-layer column chromatography (Merck silica gel 6OF254 0.5 mm, acetone : hexane = 1 : 1) to give 7-deacetylpyripyropene A (17 mg, yield 61%). The results of measurement by ESI-MS and 1H-NMR showed that the compound was PR-7 descR1bed in Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 259569/1996.<br>

1,11-Dideacetylpyripyropene A (61 mg) synthesized by the process descR1bed in Example 15 was dissolved in N,N-dimethylformamide (1.2 ml_). Pyridine (0.3 mL) was added to the solution at 0°C, the mixture was stirred at that temperature for 10 min, cyclopropanecarbonyl chloride (77 mg) was added thereto, and the mixture was stirred at that temperature for 1.5 hr.

dideacetylpyripyropene A<br>
1,11-Dideacetylpyripyropene A (25.76 g) was suspended in ethyl acetate (130 ml_), pyridine (15.84 g) was added to the suspension. The mixture was cooled to 10 to 15°C. Cyclopropanecarbonyl chloride (15.70 g) was added dropwise thereto, and the mixture was stirred at 25 to 30°C for 3 hr. The reaction solution was again cooled to 10 to 15°C, and water (50 mL) was added dropwise thereto. The mixture was adjusted to pH 2.59 by the addition of 5 N-hydrochloric acid, followed by separation. The organic layer was washed with 5% sodium bicarbonate water (50 mL) and 10% brine (50 mL) in that order. The ethyl acetate solution thus obtained was removed by evaporation under the reduced pressure and was further replaced with methanol to adjust the liquid volume to about 130 mL. Water (130 mL) was added dropwise thereto. The precipitated light yellow powder was collected by filtration, was washed twice with a 50% aqueous methanol solution (40 mL), and was dried at 40°C for 23 hr to give 30.80 g of 1,11-0-dicyclopropanecarbonyl-l,ll-dideacetylpyripyropene A.
