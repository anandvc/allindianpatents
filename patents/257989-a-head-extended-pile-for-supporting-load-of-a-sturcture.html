				<td>PILE WITH AN EXTENDED HEAD AND WORKING<br>
METHOD OF THE SAME<br>
[Technical Field]<br>
The present invention relates to a head-extended pile, and more<br>
particularly to a head-extended pile having an increased supporting force to<br>
support load of a structure. Also, the present invention relates to a method for<br>
constructing such a head-extended pile with stability, construction workability,<br>
and economic efficiency.<br>
[Background Art]<br>
When a building or a structure is built, construction of a foundation for<br>
reinforcing the ground is generally carried out according to conditions of the<br>
ground or the load of the building or the structure so that the building or the<br>
.<br>
structure can be supported on the ground. Construction of a shallow foundation or<br>
a deep foundation is carried out based on various conditions, such as load of a<br>
structure. The shallow foundation is a foundation having a penetration width ratio<br>
below 1 while the deep foundation is a foundation having a penetration width ratio<br>
above 1. In the case of the shallow foundation, a structure is directly supported on<br>
the ground without using piles. In the case that a structure is not sufficiently<br>
supported on the ground, on the other hand, piles are used to reinforce a<br>
supporting force of the ground.<br>
A pile foundation system is a foundation system characterized in that<br>
heads of the constructed piles are connected to a structure. Piles may be classified<br>
into steel piles, concrete piles, and composite piles on the basis of their material.<br>
Pile installation methods may be classified into pile driving, auger drilled piling,<br>
and in-place casting.<br>
The pile driving is a method characterized in that a pile is erected, and is<br>
then forcibly driven into the ground by hammering until the pile is folly penetrated<br>
into the ground. When the pile is forcibly penetrated into the ground by means of<br>
hammering energy, the pile is penetrated while the pile pushes through the soil<br>
around the pile. Consequently, a supporting force of the pile is excellent, and the<br>
pile is simply constructed.<br>
However, the pile driving method has a drawback in that it is difficult to<br>
penetrate the pile vertically when the pile need to be deeply penetrated into the<br>
ground. Also, excessive vibration and noise are generated when the pile driving<br>
method is carried out. Consequently, the pile driving method is limitedly used in<br>
urban areas due to certain restrictions.<br>
On the other hand, the auger drilled piling is a method characterized in<br>
that a hole is previously bored in the ground, a cement paste is poured halfway<br>
into the hole, and then a pile is fixedly inserted into the hole. The auger drilled<br>
piling method can solve the drawbacks of the pile driving method. Currently, the<br>
pile burying method is mainly used to construct pile foundations in urban areas.<br>
The construction of the foundation is an extremely important in the<br>
aspect of building the structure. Various pile installation methods are used without<br>
consistency on the basis of the personal experience of constructors because<br>
conditions of the ground or vary according to site, or operation of a pile-driving<br>
machine is not fully understood. As a result, the pile constructing work: is not<br>
easily carried out.<br>
FIG. 1 is a conceptual drawing showing the relation between an inherent<br>
proof stress of a pile and a constructional proof stress of the constructed pile. As<br>
shown in FIG. 1, load (PF) of a structure 11 is supported by means of<br>
constructional proof stress of a plurality of piles 12 penetrated into the ground<br>
below the structure 11. The constructional proof stress of the constructed pile 12<br>
is the sum of a front end bearing force (TF) at the front end of the pile and a<br>
surrounding frictional force (SF) at the outer circumference of the pile. Generally,<br>
the inherent proof stress of the pile is larger than constructional proof stress.<br>
However, the constructional proof stress of the pile is decreased due to its bad<br>
construction workability.<br>
For example, a O 400 high-strength concrete pile (hereinafter, referred to<br>
as "PHC pile") has an inherent proof stress of 112 tf and a constructional proof<br>
stress of 60 to 80 tf. As a result, 32 to 52tf of the inherent proof stress of the pile<br>
is wasted. Especially when auger drilled piling method is used, a drilled hole<br>
having a diameter larger than that of a pile, the pile is penetrated into the hole, and<br>
cement paste is poured between the pile and the ground in order to increase a<br>
surrounding frictional force. However, a test of the pile after the construction is<br>
completed reveals that the surrounding frictional force is insignificant and most of<br>
the constructional proof stress is the front end bearing force. Consequently, it is<br>
necessary to increase the constructional proof stress near the inherent proof stress<br>
of the pile in the auger drilled piling method so that efficiency in use of the pile<br>
can be improved.<br>
[Disclosure]<br>
[Technical Problem]<br>
Therefore, the present invention has been made to solve the above<br>
problems, and it is an object of the present invention to provide a head-extended<br>
pile having an increased constructional proof stress, so that the pile can have<br>
increased support load for a structure without increasing the weight and the<br>
volume of the pile used in a auger drilled piling method, moreover efficiency in<br>
use of the pile and economic efficiency of the pile are improved. It is also the<br>
object of the present invention to provide a method for constructing such a headextended<br>
pile with stability, construction workability, and economic efficiency.<br>
[Technical Solution]<br>
In accordance with one aspect of the present invention, the above and<br>
other objects can be accomplished by the provision of a pile having a<br>
reinforcement part attached to or integrally formed with the front end of the pile,<br>
the reinforcement part having a prescribed thickness and a diameter slightly larger<br>
than that of the pile, so that the front end supporting force of the pile is increased.<br>
The reinforcement part may be formed at one end of the pile or at either<br>
end of the pile.<br>
The pile can have a additional a conical member or reinforcement wings<br>
formed on the reinforcement part.<br>
In accordance with another aspect of the present invention, there is<br>
provided a constructing method of a head-extended pile in the ground composed<br>
of collapsible soil when the ground is bored, comprising the steps of: selecting a<br>
pile, preparing and checking a pile driving operation, and removing obstructions<br>
(S10); inspecting the ground, reinforcing the ground, and installing a pile-driving<br>
machine (S20); checking perpendicularity of a casing or a screw auger and a<br>
reader at the front and. at the side to fix the position of the casing (S30);<br>
confirming a soil layer status where the pile can be driven on the basis of<br>
excavation, a geological survey report, used current of an auger motor, the<br>
discharged amount of soil, and a trial pile driving operation so that the excavation<br>
is carried out by means of the casing and the screw auger (S40); mixing water and<br>
cement by means of an exclusive cement mixer (S50); injecting cement paste at<br>
high pressure after the screw auger is withdrawn (S60); penetrating the screw<br>
auger again to stir the cement paste and treat the slime (S70); slowly withdrawing<br>
the screw auger (S80); erecting the head-extended pile so that the head-extended<br>
pile is penetrated by means of its own weight (S90); fixing the upper end of the<br>
head-extended pile by means of the screw auger (SI00); slowly withdrawing the<br>
casing after the upper end of the pile is fixed by means of the screw auger (SI 10);<br>
and driving the head-extended pile so that the pile can be penetrated (SI20).<br>
In accordance with yet another aspect of the present invention, there is<br>
provided a constructing method of a head-extended pile in the ground composed<br>
of uncollapsible soil when the ground is bored, comprising the steps of: selecting a<br>
pile, preparing and checking a pile driving operation, and removing obstructions<br>
(S200); inspecting the ground to be constructed, reinforcing the ground, and<br>
installing a pile-driving machine (S210); checking perpendicularity of a screw<br>
auger and a reader at the front and at the side to fix the position of the screw auger<br>
(S220); checking a soil layer where the pile can be driven on the basis of<br>
excavation, a geological survey report, used current of an auger motor, the<br>
discharged amount of soil, and a trial pile driving operation so that the excavation<br>
is carried out by means of the screw auger (S230); mixing water and cement by<br>
means of an exclusive mixer to obtain cement paste (S240); withdrawing the<br>
screw auger (S250); injecting the cement paste at high pressure (S260);<br>
penetrating the screw auger again to stir the cement paste and treat the slime<br>
(S270); erecting the head-extended pile so that the pile is penetrated by means of<br>
its own weight (S280); and driving the head-extended pile so that the pile can be<br>
penetrated (S290).<br>
[Advantageous Effects]<br>
According to the present invention, the constructional proof stress of a<br>
pile can be increased to near the inherent proof stress of the pile without<br>
increasing the weight and the volume of the pile. Consequently, the quantity of<br>
the piles to be used in a pile burying work is reduced, therefore efficiency in use of<br>
the pile and economic efficiency of the pile are improved. Also, the reinforcement<br>
part or the reinforcement disk can be attached to a conventional pile in market.<br>
Consequently, applicability of the conventional pile is also improved.<br>
A designed proof stress of the pile is generally decided by pile<br>
manufacturers in such a manner that the designed proof stress corresponds to the<br>
proof stress of the pile decided on the basis of the ground conditions or the<br>
construction workability, which is lower than the inherent proof stress of the pile.<br>
As a result, the designed proof stress of the pile is reduced by approximately 30 to<br>
40 % compared to inherent proof stress. However, 100 % of the proof stress can<br>
be utilized in this construction method when the head-extended pile according to<br>
the present invention method is used. As a result, the designed proof stress of the<br>
pile is decided so that the designed proof stress of the pile can be matched the<br>
inherent proof stress of the pile.<br>
The designed proof stress of the pile can be increased with the result that<br>
the quantity of the piles to be used is decreased, which leads to saving the cost and<br>
time of construction. Also, the length of the pile can be decreased when the design<br>
is completed so that the pile has a relatively small proof stress.<br>
When the head-extended pile is prepared and driven in the same manner<br>
as the conventional pile constructing method, and the pile construction is<br>
completed at an N value of approximately 50/20 ~ 10, a required supporting force<br>
is obtained as compared to a pile construction designed in the field.<br>
Consequently, the pile constructing method according to the present<br>
invention can guarantee the economic efficiency, safety, and improved<br>
construction workability as compared to the conventional pile constructing<br>
method.<br>
When the designed proof stress of the pile is small, the length of the pile<br>
can be reduced by approximately 20 to 40 %. Consequently, cost of construction<br>
is reduced.<br>
In the case that the designed proof stress of the pile is increased through<br>
the use of the head-extended pile according to the present invention, the total<br>
number of the piles may be reduced by approximately 30 to 40 %.<br>
Also, the size of pile cap is decreased, arid thus the amount of concrete<br>
cement and required reinforcing steel is reduced by approximately 10 to 20 %.<br>
Furthermore, construction time is considerably reduced as the total number of the<br>
piles is decreased, and direct material and labor cost, indirect cost, personnel<br>
expenses, and financial expenses according to duration, are considerably reduced.<br>
The present invention is very useful method for building and civil construction.<br>

 [Best Mode]<br>
Now, preferred embodiments of the present invention will be described<br>
in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings.<br>
FIG. 2 is a sectional view showing the structure of a reinforcement pile<br>
having a reinforcement part provided at one end thereof. As shown in FIG. 2, a<br>
head-extended pile 2 comprises a cylindrical pile part 12 and a lower<br>
reinforcement part 20. The lower reinforcement part 20 comprises a lower<br>
reinforcing member 21 and a lower conical member 22.<br>
The cylindrical pile part 12 has a diameter of 350, 400, 450, 500, or 600<br>
mm, and the cylindrical pile part 12 may be composed of a concrete pile, a PHC<br>
pile, a steel tube, a H-type beam, a composite tube, or a wood pile.<br>
The lower reinforcing member 21 may be integrally formed with the<br>
lower end of the cylindrical pile part 12 or securely fixed to the lower end of the<br>
cylindrical pile part 12 by means of a fixing unit. The lower reinforcing member<br>
21 is a disk-shaped structure of a prescribed thickness. The lower conical member<br>
22 has a prescribed slope surface connected between the end of the cylindrical pile<br>
part 12 and the end of the lower reinforcing member 21.<br>
Table 1 shows dimensions and dynamism of the pile.<br>
(Table Removed) It can be seen from Table 1 that a front end bearing force of 58 tf is<br>
necessary to obtain an inherent proof stress of 89 tf in the case of the O 350 PHC<br>
pile. However, a front end bearing force of 58 tf cannot be obtained because the<br>
cross-sectional area of the conventional pile having a diameter of 350 mm is<br>
961.625 cm2. Consequently, it is required that a cross-sectional area of the front<br>
end of the pile be 1759 cm2 to obtain a front end bearing force of 58 tf. In other<br>
words, it is required that the diameter of the reinforcement part be increased to<br>
473 mm.<br>
Referring to Table 1, it is required that the cross-sectional areas of the<br>
front ends of O 400, O 450, and O 500 PHC piles be increased to 2216 cm2, 2707<br>
cm2, and 3419 cm2, respectively, to fully utilize the inherent proof stress of the<br>
respective piles. To this end, it is required that the diameters of the reinforcement<br>
parts of the piles be increased to 531 mm, 587 mm, and 660 mm, respectively.<br>
Preferably, the diameter (D) of the lower reinforcing member 21 is equal<br>
to the thickness (T) of the lower reinforcing member 21. The slope ratio of the<br>
lower conical member 22, i.e., the ratio of the protrusion width (a) to the slope<br>
width (b), is selected within a range of 1:1 ~ 10. Preferably, the ratio of the<br>
protrusion width (a) to the slope width (b), is 1:6.<br>
FIG. 3 is a sectional view showing the structure of a reinforcement pile<br>
having reinforcement parts provided at both ends thereof. As shown in FIG. 3, the<br>
dual-side reinforcement pile comprises a cylindrical pile part 12, a lower<br>
reinforcement part 20 formed at the lower end of the cylindrical pile part 12, and<br>
an upper reinforcement part 30 formed at the upper end of the cylindrical pile part<br>
12. The upper reinforcement part 30 comprises an upper reinforcing member 31<br>
and an upper conical member 32 in the same manner as the lower reinforcement<br>
part 20 of FIG. 2. Also, the upper reinforcement part 30 has the same shape and<br>
size as the lower reinforcement part 2.0.<br>
FIG. 4 is a sectional view showing the structure of a reinforcement pile<br>
having a reinforcement disk attached to one end of a conventional pile, for<br>
example, a pre-tensioned spun high strength concrete (PHC) pile. As shown in<br>
FIG. 4, the reinforcement pile comprises a cylindrical pile part 12 and a<br>
reinforcement disk 40. The cylindrical pile part 12 has a diameter of 350, 400,<br>
450, or 500 mm, and the cylindrical pile part 12 may be composed of a concrete<br>
pile, a PHC pile, or a steel tube. The reinforcement disk 40 is made of iron.<br>
The reinforcement disk 40, having a disk-shaped structure of a prescribed<br>
thickness, is securely fixed to the lower end of the cylindrical pile part 12 by<br>
means of a fixing unit. In the case that the cylindrical pile part 12 is composed of<br>
the steel tube, the reinforcement disk 40 can be securely fixed to the lower end of<br>
the cylindrical pile part 12 by welding. In the case that the cylindrical pile part 12<br>
is composed of the concrete pile or the PHC pile, on the other hand, the cylindrical<br>
pile part 12 is provided at the lower end thereof with an iron disk 41, which<br>
surrounds the lower end of the cylindrical pile part 12, and the reinforcement disk<br>
40 can be securely fixed to the iron disk 41 by welding with the result that the<br>
reinforcement disk 40 is securely fixed to the cylindrical pile part 12.<br>
Table 2 shows dimensions and dynamism of the pile and the<br>
reinforcement disk.<br>
(Table Removed)It can be seen from Table 2 that a front end bearing force of 58 tf is<br>
necessary to obtain an inherent proof stress of 89 tf in the case of the $ 350 PHC<br>
pile. However, a front end bearing force of 58 tf cannot be obtained because the<br>
cross-sectional area of the conventional pile having a diameter of 350 mm is<br>
961.625 cm2. Consequently, it is required that a cross-sectional area of the front<br>
end of the pile be increased to obtain a front end bearing force of 58 tf. In Table<br>
2, the cross-sectional area of the reinforcement disk is 1759 cm2, the diameter of<br>
the reinforcement disk is 473 mm, and the thickness of the reinforcement disk is<br>
10.8mm.<br>
It can also be seen from Table 2 that the cross-sectional areas of the<br>
reinforcement disks are increased to 2216 cm2, 2707 cm2<br>
5 and 3419 cm2,<br>
respectively, to fully utilize the inherent proof stress of the respective piles. Also,<br>
the diameters of the reinforcement disks are increased to 531 mm, 587 mm, and<br>
660 mm, respectively. Table 2 reveals that the thickness of the reinforcement disk<br>
is increased as the protruded length of the reinforcement disk is increased.<br>
FIG. 5 is a sectional view showing a reinforcement pile having<br>
reinforcement wings for supporting the protrusion part of the reinforcement, disk<br>
shown in FIG. 4. When the protruded length of the reinforcement disk 40<br>
extending outward from the cylindrical pile part 12 is large or the thickness (t) of<br>
the reinforcement disk 40 is small, the outer edge of the reinforcement disk 40<br>
may be bent upward.<br>
As a result, the effective cross-sectional area of the reinforcement disk 40<br>
is reduced, and thus the front end bearing force is reduced. In order to prevent this<br>
phenomenon, a plurality of reinforcement wings 50 are provided between the<br>
reinforcement disk 40 and the cylindrical pile part 12, as shown in FIG. 5.<br>
Preferably, each reinforcement wing 50 is a triangular iron plate. The<br>
reinforcement wings 50 are disposed on the upper surface of the reinforcement<br>
disk 40 while being spaced a prescribed distance from each other in such a manner<br>
that the reinforcement wings 50 arranged around the cylindrical pile part 12. The<br>
reinforcement wings 50 can be securely fixed to the reinforcement disk 40, for<br>
example, by welding because the reinforcement wings 50 and the reinforcement<br>
disk 40 are made of iron.<br>
In the case of the PHC pile, the reinforcement wings 50 are securely fixed<br>
to the iron disk 41 surrounding the lower end of the cylindrical pile part 12 by<br>
welding. In the case of the steel pile, on the other hand, the reinforcement wings<br>
50 are directly fixed to the outer circumference of the steel pile by welding.<br>
The enlarged perspective view of the circle of FIG. 5 shows the shape<br>
and connection of the reinforcement wings 50.<br>
Through the center of the reinforcement disk 40 is formed a waterdischarging<br>
hole 52, by which the head-extended pile 2 is prevented from rising<br>
due to seepage of water. The seepage water is introduced into a hollow part 54<br>
defined in the head-extended pile.<br>
A method for constructing the head-extended pile with the above-stated<br>
construction according to the present invention will now be described. When a<br>
hole is bored in the ground having collapsible weathering belt, a casing 56 is used<br>
to prevent the wall of the hole from collapsing. The hole is bored up to the upper<br>
end of the soil layer where the pile driving operation of a pile-driving machine 58<br>
can be carried out, and then the pile is driven into the supporting layer.<br>
Consequently, when a hole is bored in the ground having collapsible soil,<br>
a head-extended pile 2 suitable to proof stress is selected. In the case of the PHC<br>
pile, a front-closed shoe is used. In the ground having a high water level, the<br>
water-discharging hole 52 is formed through the center of the reinforcement disk<br>
50 so that the head-extended pile 2 is prevented from rising from the water level<br>
in the hole when the head-extended pile 2 is penetrated into the ground by means<br>
of its own weight.<br>
The pile-driving machine 58 and other equipment are inspected on the<br>
basis of the ground to check whether they are normal or not. After the depth of<br>
the bored hole is estimated, marks are indicated on the pile every 50 cm from the<br>
upper end of the weathering belt and every 20 cm near the supporting layer.<br>
At this time, the upper end of the weathering belt is established on the<br>
basis of an N value of 50/20 ~ 10. The trial pile driving method is preferably<br>
carried out to estimate the upper end of the weathering belt, although such<br>
estimation may be basis of a geological survey report, an RPM value of the<br>
machine, or the discharged amount of soil.<br>
The diameter of the casing 56 is preferably 500 mm larger than the<br>
diameter of the head-extended pile 2. The safety of the pile-driving machine 58<br>
has a great effect on the construction of the pile. Consequently, perpendicularity<br>
of a screw auger 62 when being penetrated affects the pile-driving machine 58<br>
when the pile is driven by means of the pile-driving machine 58. In some cases,<br>
an accident may occur when the pile is driven.<br>
Also, the mixing ratio of water to cement is 1:1, and approximately 40 kg<br>
of cement is compounded per meter. The mixed cement is transferred at high<br>
pressure, and thus relevant equipment, such as a mixer plant, a mix measuring<br>
unit, and a compressor, which are not shown in the drawings, are placed in the<br>
same place so that the equipment can be easily and conveniently managed.<br>
Obstructions on or in the ground are removed.<br>
As described above, the pile is selected, the pile driving operation is<br>
prepared and checked, and the obstructions are removed (S10).<br>
When the pile-driving machine 58 is installed (S20), a lining board is laid<br>
or stones are spread out to reinforce the ground if the pile-driving machine 58 may<br>
tilt or move during the pile driving operation because the ground is soft and weak.<br>
In this way, the ground to be constructed is inspected and reinforced, if necessary,<br>
before the pile-driving machine 58 is installed (S20).<br>
Perpendicularity of the casing 56, the screw auger 62 and a reader 64 is<br>
checked at the front and at the side, and then the position of the casing 56, the<br>
screw auger 62 and the reader 64 is fixed (S30).<br>
In order to protect the wall of the bored hole and prevent blockage of the<br>
discharging hole, the screw auger 62 is inserted into the casing 56, and then<br>
excavation is carried out in such a manner that the screw auger 62 is rotated in the<br>
forward direction and the casing 56 is rotated in the reverse direction. The hole is<br>
excavated earlier by means of the front end of the screw auger 62 than the casing<br>
56. Slime is discharged by means of high-pressure air supplied from the front end<br>
of the screw auger 62.<br>
The casing 56 is penetrated into the ground until the casing 56 reaches a<br>
soil layer where the wall of the hole is not collapsible, and the casing 56 is<br>
penetrated to.an N value of 50/20 ~ 10 (near the weathering belt).<br>
The soil layer in the ground where the pile can be driven is checked on<br>
the basis of the geological survey report. Also, the soil layer is accurately checked<br>
through the preparation of a section of the soil layer of the geological survey<br>
lengthwise and breadthwise. The prepared sectional view of the soil layer is<br>
compared with the result of the trial pile driving operation to indicate a predictive<br>
penetration depth of the pile on the sectional view. In this way, the geological<br>
survey report is prepared.<br>
When the pile reaches the soil layer where the pile can be driven, the<br>
excavation speed of the screw auger 62 is maintained at a constant speed, and<br>
RPM is recorded. The method for checking the soil layer where the pile can be<br>
driven by means of the RPM is not accurate due to uncertainty of the soil layer.<br>
Consequently, the RPM method is used only for reference in the field. A column<br>
diagram is accurately prepared, and then the prepared column diagram is<br>
compared to the predictive penetration depth of the pile to check used current of<br>
an auger motor.<br>
The soil discharged by means of the screw auger 62 is mixed, and thus<br>
the nature of soil cannot be accurately checked. Consequently, the soil layer is<br>
estimated through comparison with the geological survey report to check the<br>
discharged soil.<br>
The trial pile driving operation is carried out at several places, if possible,<br>
considering the field circumstances and the machine penetration conditions to<br>
exactly record the status of the soil layer and mark the predictive penetration depth<br>
of the pile. In this way, the main pile driving operation is prepared. When the<br>
trial pile driving operation is carried out, the operation is carried out at least twice<br>
every house, and the operation is carried out within a distance of 30 m in.the case<br>
of a parking place. Preferably, the trial pile driving operation is carried out as<br>
several times as possible.<br>
Also, the result of the trial pile driving operation is indicated on the<br>
arrangement view and the sectional view so that the position and the range where<br>
the pile can be driven are indicated and thus used in the field. The lower the<br>
excavation speed is, the better the result. When the screw auger is rotated in the<br>
reverse direction while the excavation is carried out, the soil attached to the screw<br>
auger 62 is dropped into the hole. Consequently, it is necessary that the screw<br>
auger not be rotated in the reverse direction.<br>
As described above, the soil layer where the pile can be driven is checked<br>
on the basis of the excavation, the geological survey report, the used current of the<br>
auger motor, the discharged amount of soil, and the trial pile driving operation,<br>
and then the excavation is carried out by means of the casing 56 and the screw<br>
auger 62 (S40).<br>
The previously prepared cement paste mixer, the compressor, and the<br>
generator are placed in the same place. The pouring of material is carried out such<br>
that water is poured, and then cement is poured. The front end of the pile is<br>
penetrated by means of a subsequent pile driving operation. Consequently, the<br>
mixture of cement (40 kg/m) and water in a 1:1 ratio is poured into the bored hole<br>
(S50).<br>
After the mixture of the cement and the water, i.e., cement paste 66 is<br>
prepared, the casing 56 for protecting the wall of the hole is left as it is until the<br>
cement past 66 is poured. The cement paste 66 is injected at high pressure while<br>
the screw auger 62 is slowly withdrawn (S60).<br>
After that, the cement paste 66 is mixed with the surrounding soil to<br>
increase the surrounding frictional force. Most of the proof stress of the headextended<br>
pile 2 is derived from the front end supporting force. Consequently, the<br>
screw auger 62 is penetrated again to stir the cement paste 66 and treat the slime<br>
(S70).<br>
At this time, attention is paid to the penetration depth so that the screw<br>
auger 62.does not damage the supporting foundation when the screw auger 62 is<br>
inserted.<br>
After that, the screw auger 62 is withdrawn again as slowly as possible<br>
(S80).<br>
Subsequently, the head-extended pile 2 is erected such that the center of<br>
the head-extended pile 2 exactly corresponds to the center of the bored hole, and<br>
then the head-extended pile 2 is penetrated by means of its own weight. When the<br>
head-extended pile 2 is penetrated, the cement paste 66 may overflow out of the<br>
bored hole. In order to prevent this phenomenon, the pile is slowly penetrated<br>
(S90).<br>
After the head-extended pile 2 is penetrated, the upper end of the pile is<br>
fixed to the front end of the screw auger 62 (S100), and then the casing 56 is<br>
slowly withdrawn (SI 10).<br>
After that, a shock-absorbing member, not shown in the drawings, is<br>
placed at the front end of the head-extended pile 2, and then a ram freely drops to<br>
penetrate the pile. The final driving operation is carried out while the upper end<br>
of the pile is held such that error of the vertical movement of the ram is corrected<br>
depending upon the circumstances of the field (SI 20).<br>
When the pile is driven, attention is paid to perpendicularity and shake of<br>
the pile, and destruction of the front end of the pile. When the perpendicularity of<br>
the pile is changed while the pile is driven, the pile may be destroyed or the proof<br>
stress of the pile affected.. Consequently, it is required that the pile be driven ,<br>
while the center of the pile exactly corresponds to the center of the ram.<br>
When it is determined that the pile reaches the predicted level of the<br>
supporting layer as the result of the pile driving operation (the average penetration<br>
depth per pile driving operation is approximately 5 to 10 mm), the operation of the<br>
pile driving machine 58 is stopped for a while, and then a sinking amount<br>
recording device is installed. After the sinking amount recording device is<br>
installed, the pile driving operation is initiated again to measure the penetration<br>
amount and the rebound amount (SI30).<br>
Another method for penetrating the head-extended pile into the ground<br>
having collapsible soil when the hole is bored will now be described. The pile is<br>
selected, the pile driving operation is prepared and checked, and the obstructions<br>
are removed (S200). The ground to be constructed is inspected and reinforced, if<br>
necessary, and then the pile-driving machine 58 is installed (S210).<br>
Perpendicularity of the screw auger 62 and the reader 64 is checked at the<br>
front and at the side, and then the position of the screw auger 62 and the reader 64<br>
is fixed (S220). The soil layer where the pile can be driven is checked on the<br>
basis of the excavation, the geological survey report, the used current of the auger<br>
motor, the discharged amount of soil, and the trial pile driving operation, and then<br>
the excavation is carried out by means of the screw auger 62 (S230).<br>
After that, water and cement are mixed with each other by means of an<br>
exclusive mixer (not shown) to obtain cement paste (S240). After the screw auger<br>
62 is withdrawn (S250), the cement paste 66 is injected at high pressure (S260).<br>
The screw auger 62 is penetrated again to stir the cement paste 66 and<br>
treat the slirne (S270). Subsequently, the head-extended pile 2 is erected, and then<br>
the head-extended pile 2 is penetrated by means of its own weight (S280). At this<br>
time, the pile is slowly penetrated so that the cement paste 66 does not overflow<br>
out of the bored hole.<br>
After that, a shock-absorbing member, not shown in the drawings, is<br>
placed at the front end of the head-extended pile 2, and then pile driving operation<br>
is carried out. The final driving operation is performed at a height of 2 m to<br>
obtain the final sinking amount (S290).<br>
When it is determined that the pile reaches the predicted level of the<br>
supporting layer as the result of the pile driving operation (the average penetration<br>
depth per pile driving operation is approximately 5 to 10 mm), the operation of the<br>
pile driving machine 58 is stopped for a while, and then a sinking amount<br>
recording device is installed. After the sinking amount recording device is<br>
installed, the pile driving operation is initiated again to measure the penetration<br>
amount and the rebound amount, and thus the final sinking amount (S300).<br>
Those skilled in the art will appreciate that any constructing method<br>
using the head-extended pile according to the present invention falls into the scope<br>
