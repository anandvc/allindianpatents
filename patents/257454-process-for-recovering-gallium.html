Title of the Invention<br>
Process for Recovering Gallium<br>
Field of Technology<br>
This invention relates to a process for recovering gallium from the Bayer liquor (an aqueous solution of sodium aluminate) generated in the Bayer process for producing alumina from bauxite. More particularly, in a process for recovering gallium which comprises bringing the Bayer liquor into contact with a chelating agent composed of a water-insoluble substituted quinolinol to let the chelating agent to capture gallium contained in the Bayer liquor, bringing an inverse capturing solution containing a substituted quinolinol into contact with the gallium-containing chelating agent to extact gallium into the inverse capturing solution, and recovering gallium metal from the gallium-containing inverse capturing solution, this invention relates to a process for recovering gallium metal efficiently from the inverse capturing solution containing gallium in extremely low concentrations.<br>
Background Technology<br>
According to the Bayer process, alumina is extracted from bauxite with an aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide. Gallium contained in bauxite in<br><br>
a minute quantity is extracted together with alumina in the sodium hydroxide extract of bauxite or the Bayer liquor also contains a minute quantity of gallium.<br>
On account of its usefulness as a raw material for semiconductor compounds, scintillators, and the like, gallium has been recovered from the Bayer liquor thus far and several processes including one based on amalgamation have been proposed for the recovery. Of those proposals, a process regarded as most effective at the present time comprises preparing an adsorbent by supporting a substituted quinolinol as a chelating agent capable of forming a chelate with gallium on a porous resin substrate, bringing the Bayer liquor into contact with the adsorbent to let the adsorbent capture gallium contained in the Bayer liquor, extracting gallium from the adsorbent by an inverse capturing solution composed of an aqueous solution of a strong acid such as hydrochloric acid and sulfuric acid, and recovering gallium from the gallium-containing inverse capturing solution (reference should be made, for example, to JP 60-42,234 A, JP4-38,453 B, and JP7-94,324 B).<br>
A process proposed for the commercial recovery of gallium metal from the gallium-containing inverse capturing solution obtained in the aforementioned manner comprises bringing this gallium-containing inverse capturing solution into contact with an ion exchange resin, either anionic or cationic, to let the ion exchange resin capture gallium selectively, eluting gallium from the ion exchange resin by an aqueous solution of hydrochloric acid or sulfuric acid or by pure water, concentrating the eluted acidic solution of gallium, and electrolyzing the<br><br>
acidic solution to obtain gallium metal (reference should be made, tor example, to Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, 5th Ed., Vol. A12,pp. 163-167, 1989).<br>
In the aforementioned process for recovering gallium, however, a strongly acidic aqueous solution is used not only as an inverse capturing solution but also as an eluting solution in large amounts during concentration by the use of an ion exchange resin and this inevitably generates waste acid in large amounts. The waste acid contains a variety of metallic and other impurities originating from the Bayer liquor besides gallium and it cannot be simply reused for the recovery of gallium even in the same process for recovering gallium and the disposal of waste acid generated in large amounts becomes a burden.<br>
According to another process proposed, for example, in JP56"38,661 B, the acidic solution of gallium is not electrolyzed as it is but first neutralized with an aqueous alkaline solution to form a slurry of gallium hydroxide, the slurry is filtered to recover gallium hydroxide, the gallium hydroxide is dissolved in an alkaline solution to give an alkaline electrolytic solution of gallium, and the alkaline electrolytic solution of gallium is subjected to direct current electrolysis to recover gallium metal.<br>
In this process, however, the crystals of gallium hydroxide formed in the neutralization with alkali are extremely fine on the order of 2pm at most; thus the slurry becomes gel-like and the normal procedure for concentration by sedimentation or filtration of the slurry requires a long time.<br>
Moreover,   according  to  this  process  for  electrolyzing  the   alkaline<br><br>
electrolytic solution of gallium to recover gallium metal, spongy gallium forms inevitably unless the concentration of iron ions in the alkaline electrolytic solution of gallium is kept below 5 ppm, preferably below 2 ppm, and the yield of recovery of gallium metal drops and spongy gallium must be disposed of or returned to the first treating step.<br>
Now, a process proposed in JP2001-97,716 A for electrolyzing an alkaline solution of gallium to obtain gallium metal aims at preventing gallium hydroxide from forming fine crystals by coprecipitating gallium hydroxide and a substance that is effective for improving the sedimentation of gallium, for example, jarosite [Fes(S04)2(OH)6], "eluting gallium by dissolving the coprecipitate in caustic soda" to prepare an alkaline electrolytic solution of gallium, and electrolyzing this electrolytic solution. However, in this process as well, the steps until the preparation of the alkaline electrolytic solution of gallium become complex and the recovery and waste disposal of the additives such as jarosite create new problems.<br>
Disclosure of the Invention<br>
Under the circumstances, the inventors of this invention have undertaken intensive studies to solve the problems confronting the conventional processes for recovering gallium from the Bayer liquor, found that the adoption of an electrodialysis step where an inverse capturing solution containing gallium is concentrated and an acid is recovered, an iron removal step where iron in the concentrated gallium  solution is<br><br>
separated and removed as iron hydroxide, and an ultrafiltration step where the iron-free gallium solution obtained in the iron removal step is neutralized and then subjected to ultrafiltration to obtain a concentrated slurry of gallium hydroxide makes it possible to reuse the acid without generating waste acid in large amounts, increase the concentration of gallium in an alkaline electrolytic solution of gallium thereby raising the current efficiency in the electrolysis step, reduce the amount of waste liquor, and minimize the formation of spongy gallium, and completed this invention.<br>
Accordingly, this invention relates to a process for recovering gallium which comprises bringing the Bayer liquor into contact with a chelating agent composed of a water-insoluble substituted quinolinol to let the chelating agent capture gallium contained in the Bayer liquor, bringing an inverse capturing solution containing a substituted quinolinol into contact with the gallium-containing chelating agent to extract gallium into the inverse capturing solution, and recovering gallium metal from the gallium-containing inverse capturing solution and an object of this invention is to provide a process for recovering gallium which makes it possible to reuse the acid without generating waste acid in large amounts, increase the concentration of gallium in the alkaline electrolytic solution of gallium thereby raising the current efficiency in the electrolysis step, reduce the amount of waste liquor, and minimize the formation of spongy gallium.<br>
Thus, in a process for recovering gallium which comprises bringing the Bayer liquor into contact with a chelating agent composed of a water-insoluble substituted quinolinol to let the chelaging agent capture gallium<br><br>
contained in the Bayer liquor, bringing an inverse capturing solution composed of an acidic aqueous solution of a substituted quinolinol into contact with the gallium-containing chelating agent to extract gallium into the inverse capturing solution, and recovering gallium metal from the gallium-containing inverse capturing solution, this invention provides a process for recovering gallium which comprises an electrodialysis step where the aforementioned inverse capturing solution containing gallium is electrodialyzed to increase the concentration of gallium and the acid is recovered, an iron removal step where the concentrated gallium solution obtained in the electrodialysis step is adjusted to a given pH, the precipitated iron hydroxide is separated and removed to give an iron-free gallium solution, an ultrafiltration step where the iron-free gallium solution is neutralized to form a slurry of gallium hydroxide and the slurry is concentrated by ultrafiltration, a redissolution step where the concentrated slurry of gallium hydroxide is dissolved in an alkaline solution to prepare an alkaline electrolytic solution of gallium, and an electrolysis step where the alkaline electrolytic solution of gallium is electrolyzed to recover gallium metal.<br>
According to this invention, any of the conventional processes involving the use of a water-insoluble substituted quinolinol as a chelating agent, for example, the one described in JP7-94,324 A, can be applied as it is to the step for capturing of gallium where the Bayer liquor is brought into contact with a chelating agent composed of a water-insoluble substituted quinolinol and to the step for inverse capturing of gallium where an inverse   capturing   solution   composed   of  an   acidic   aqueous   solution<br><br>
containing a substituted quinolinol is brought into contact with the gallium-containing chelating agent to extract gallium into the inverse capturing solution.<br>
In the electrodialysis step of this invention where the aforementioned inverse capturing solution containing gallium is electrodialyzed, the concentration of acid in the solution usually ranges from 0.4 to 2 N and it is advantageous to perform the electrodialysis so that the concentration of acid becomes normally 0.4 N or less, preferably 0.2 N or less. In this manner, it becomes possible to otain a concentrated solution of gallium in which the concentration of gallium is increased 1.2 times or more, preferably 1.5 times or more, and achieve the recovery of acid to a significant degree to allow reuse of the acid. No restriction is imposed on the apparatus for this electrodialysis step and a commercial apparatus, for example, Model TS-50-740 available from Tokuyama Corporation, can be used as it is.<br>
The concentrated gallium solution obtained in the electrodialysis step normally contains 5 ppm or more of iron ions. The solution is then supplied to the iron removal step, the concentration of iron ions is reduced to 0.5 ppm or less, preferably 0.2 ppm or less, and an iron-free solution is recovered. In this iron removal step, an alkali is added to the concentrated gallium solution to adjust the pH to a value between 10 and 13, preferably between 12 and 12.5, and a precipitate of iron hydroxide formed as a result of this pH adjustment is separated and removed by a means such as a thickener. When the concentration of iron ions in the iron-free gallium solution obtained in this iron removal step  is higher than  0.5  ppm,<br><br>
signifcant control over the formation of spongy gallium becomes difficult to exercise.<br>
The iron-free gallium solution obtained in the iron removal step is then supplied to the ultrafiltration step, the solution is neutralized to form gallium hydroxide, and the resulting gallium hydroxide slurry is concentrated by ultrafiltration to give a concentrated slurry of gallium hydroxide.<br>
The neutralization of the iron-free gallium solution in the ultrafiltration step is carried out by adjusting the pH to 7 ± 0.6, preferably 7± 0.3, by addition of an acid and an apparatus for the ultrafiltration of the gallium hydroxide slurry may be chosen from a variety of modules such as membrane module, tubular module, spiral module, hollow-fiber (capillary) module, monolith module, immersion tank type module, and rotary disk membrane module. A rotary disk membrane module is used preferably as it is capable of concentrating the solution to a high degree while preventing deposition of a solid matter on the surface of a membrane. As the initial solid content of the gallium hydroxide slurry is 0.8 to 2.6 g/L (or 0.5 to 1.5 g/L as gallium), it is advantageous here to concentrate this solid content at least 30 times, preferably from 40 to 70 times. When the degree of concentration is less than 30 times, the current efficiency becomes difficult to raise in the electrolysis step and the amount of waste liquor increases.<br>
The concentrated slurry of gallium hydroxide prepared in this manner is dissolved in the redissolution step to prepare an alkaline electrolytic solution of gallium and this electrolytic solution is then electrolyzed in the electrolysis step to recover gallium metal.<br><br>
In the redissolution step, an aqueous alkaline solution, preferably a highly concentrated one, is added to the concentrated gallium hydroxide slurry whose gallium content is 30 to 70 g/L and the gallium hydroxide in the slurry is dissolved completely to give an alkaline electrolytic solution of gallium whose gallium content is 23 to 53 g/L, preferably 35 to 45 g/L. The electrolysis is performed in the usual manner at a current density of 0.1 to 0.16 A/cm2, preferably 0.12 to 0.14 A/cm2, at a voltage of 2 to 5 V, preferably 3 to 4 V, and at a bath temperature of 40 to 70 °C, preferably 50 to 60 °C, while keeping the current density or voltage constant.<br>
According to this invention, the inverse capturing solution containing gallium is electrodialyzed to increase the concentration of gallium and the acid is recovered in the electrodialysis step, the pH of the concentrated gallium solution is adjusted and the precipitated iron hydroxide is separated and removed in the iron removal step, the iron-free gallium solution is neutralized and the resulting gallium hydroxide slurry is concentrated by ultrafiltration in the ultrafiltration step, and a highly concentrated alkaline electrolytic solution of gallium prepared from the concentrated gallium hydroxide slurry is electrolyzed to recover gallium metal; as a result, it is possible to reuse the acid without generating waste acid in large amounts, raise the current efficiency in the electrolysis step, reduce the amount of waste liquor, and minimize the formation of spongy gallium thereby markedly raising the rate of recovery of gallium.<br>
