				<td>Method and apparatus for pacth clamp masurments on cells <br>
The invention relates to a method for measurements on cells or similar<br>
structures with the patch-clamp technique and an apparatus for these<br>
measurements.<br>
Living cells create an inner microenvironment by surrounding<br>
themselves with a lipid membrane thereby securing the function of<br>
cellular mechanisms. These lipid membranes are practically<br>
impermeable to charged particles. Therefore specialized embedded<br>
transport proteins carry ions across the membrane. They represent the<br>
basis for a variety of physiological functions including electric excitability<br>
of cells, transport of substances across membranes or cell layers and<br>
several electrical and chemical signals in cells.<br>
Cell biology research has been revolutionized by the patch-clamp<br>
method developed by Sakmann and Neher 1981. The patch-clamp<br>
technique permits the direct measurement of currents through ion<br>
transporters with high time resolution. In fact this method is the only<br>
technique that can measure conformational changes of single<br>
specialized protein molecules in real time at a time resolution of a few<br>
milliseconds. This allows for example to assess the action of signal<br>
molecules or pharmacological agents directly on the target protein.<br>
Furthermore, the technique allows to exactly control the electrical and<br>
chemical environment of a membrane and the application of signaling<br>
molecules, drugs etc. to both sides of the membrane.<br>
This technique can examine a variety of transport proteins including<br>
electrogenic ion transporters of organic and anorganic ions, selective<br>
and nonselective ion channels and other pore-inducing membrane<br>
proteins. Among the ion channels are voltage-gated, ligand-gated and<br>
store-operated channels, that are or are not selective for Na+, K+, Ca2+<br>
and CI". Even charge movements inside a membrane-associated protein<br>
can be measured (gating charges). This makes all membrane<br>
associated proteins accessible to the technique including receptors,<br>
enzymes, and their interaction with other proteins or charged molecules.<br>
Ion channels are distributed throughout tissues in a specific manner and<br>
are characterized by a great diversity of function. They are therefore<br>
ideal targets for pharmacological compounds to manipulate tissue-<br>
specific functions. Examples for such compounds are diuretics,<br>
antidiabetics, antiepileptics, local anesthetics, antiarrhytmics, some<br>
antibiotics etc. The patch-clamp technique represents an extremely<br>
sensitive method to assay the biological action of such compounds. The<br>
major disadvantage of the method is the complicated experimental<br>
procedure, the required manual manipulation and the resulting low<br>
throughput of test compounds and transport proteins.<br>
The patch-clamp techniques exists in several different modes. All these<br>
modes require micromanipulation. Under microscopic visual control a<br>
cell is mechanically approached with a glass micropipette and attached<br>
to the pipette by suction. This leads to a electrically tight bond between<br>
cellular membrane and pipette tip, a prerequisite for low-noise high-<br>
resolution recording of tiny currents. With different modes of the<br>
technique currents either through the membrane patch in the pipette tip<br>
or through the opposed membrane layer are recorded.<br>
The tight bond between cellular membrane and glass capillary is often<br>
referred to as "seal". Different seal qualities allow the experimental study<br>
of different cell types and ionic current magnitudes. In 1980 Neher and<br>
Sakman described a method to achieve a novel quality of seals, namely<br>
so-called gigaseals. This discovery was awarded the Nobel prize in 1991<br>
and the gigaseals allowed for the first time the precise measurement of<br>
ionic currents in the picoampere range in small mammalian, human,<br>
insect and other cells. In the 1981 publication the group of Neher and<br>
Sakman wrote:<br>
"The extracellular patch clamp technique has allowed, for the first time,<br>
the currents in single ionic channels to be observed (Neher and<br>
Sakmann, 1976). In this technique a small heat polished glass pipette is<br>
pressed against the cell membrane, forming an electrical seal with a<br>
resistance of the order of 50 MegaOhm (Neher et al., 1978). The high<br>
resistance of this seal ensures that most of the currents originating in a<br>
small patch of membrane flow into the pipette, and from there into<br>
current-measurement circuitry. The resistance of the seal is important<br>
also because it determines the level of background noise in the<br>
recordings.<br>
Recently it was observed that tight pipette-membrane seals, with<br>
resistances of 10-1000 GOhm, can be obtained when precautions are<br>
taken to keep the pipette surface clean, and when suction is applied to<br>
the pipette interior (Neher 1981). We call these seals "giga-seals" to<br>
distinguish them from the conventional, megaohm seals. ...<br>
Gigaseals are also mechanically stable. ...<br>
the membrane patch can be disrupted keeping the pipette cell-attached.<br>
This provides a direct low resistance access to the cell interior which<br>
allows potential recording and voltage clamping of small cells " (Hamill,<br>
Marty, Neher, Sakmann, Sigworth, Pflugers Arch. 391:85-100, 1981).<br>
A "gigaseal" is obtained when the electric resistance after approaching<br>
the cell with the pipette tip and suction reaches the Gigaohm range. The<br>
usual resistance of several 10 GigaOhm indicates that even small ions<br>
like protons are unable to pass between membrane and glass surface. It<br>
was previously assumed that such gigaseal has to form between the<br>
membrane and the rim of the pipette tip that is approached to the<br>
membrane by mechanic force and hydraulic suction. With this gigaseal<br>
modern operational amplifiers allow measurements of directed currents<br>
in the range down to 100 fA (10-13 A). In any case the currents measured<br>
represent the sum of ion transport across the membrane plus leak<br>
currents through the apparatus and preparation.<br>
The patch-clamp technique is extremely slow and requires highly<br>
qualified personnel especially because of the required<br>
micromanipulations. Approaching single cells on a microscope stage<br>
with the micromanipulator and applying suction to seal the pipette<br>
requires a high level of dexterity and experience with mechanical<br>
properties of a given cell and its micromanipulation. E.g. the mechanical<br>
force applied before suction is critical for the bonding of membrane and<br>
pipette tip. Furthermore, the seal is mechanically unstable and can be<br>
lost by mechanical perturbation and hydraulic turbulence (e.g. solution<br>
exchange). A microscope and micromanipulator are required. This<br>
prohibits miniaturization and the principally desired arrangement of<br>
arrays with multiple pipettes.<br>
The description above explains that for a variety of potential applications<br>
of the patch-clamp technique it would be desirable to examine several<br>
cells simultaneously and to obtain gigaseals automatically. This is<br>
hindered by the fact, that the tip of a micropipette must be brought into<br>
close contact with the cell membrane mechanically. The DE-A1-197 44<br>
649 describes an apparatus and a method to examine multiple cells with<br>
an array of multiple pipettes. However, in this patent application the<br>
same principle (as mentioned above) of mechanical movement of the<br>
pipette array towards the cell membrane is used. The WO 99/66329<br>
describes an array of pores in a thin planar substrate in order to apply<br>
cells and examine multiple cells simultaneously. Manufacturing such<br>
porous substrates is complicated and expensive and the adherence of<br>
cells to multiple pores is arbitrary, difficult to achieve and to control.<br>
Seals of cells with the surface of a planar substrate are mechanically<br>
unstable and are easily lost by solution exchanges. Furthermore, in all<br>
planar arrangements of pores like in the WO 99/66329 or in other<br>
transepithelial measuring apparatuses known to a person skilled in the<br>
art (e.g. Ussing chambers) the experiment is already disturbed if some<br>
of the pores are not tightly sealed with cells. The leaky pores conduct<br>
serious leak currents several orders of magnitude larger than the<br>
currents through ion transporters to be measured. In such arrangements<br>
serious problems arise with electrical crosstalk between pores,<br>
especially from leaky pores. The large electric capacitance can cause<br>
electrical noise and disturbances thereby reducing the time resolution of<br>
the measurement. This is, particularly critical when measuring voltage-<br>
gated ion channels.<br>
US-Patent 6,048,722 (corresponding to WO 97/17426) describes a<br>
cellular physiology workstation for automated data acquisition and<br>
perfusion control. The apparatus holds a Xenopus Oocyte inside a<br>
Pasteur pipette tip to form a seal between the oocyte membrane and<br>
glass. The resistance of such seal will not exceed 100-200 MegaOhm.<br>
Xenopus Oocytes are -in contrast to mammalian cells- rather large.<br>
Their outer diameter reaches &gt; 1 mm. Therefore they have a huge<br>
membrane area and contain several orders of magnitude more ion<br>
channels than other cells resulting in ionic currents in the range of<br>
several hundred to 1000 nanoAmperes. Therefore, a so-called high<br>
resistance seal (in the order of 10-200 MegaOhm) is sufficient to<br>
measure large currents in Xenopus Oocytes. However, these cells are of<br>
amphibian origin and therefore of limited use for the study of ion channel<br>
function in mammalian and human cells. In mammalian cells that<br>
typically have a diameter ranging from 5-50 micrometers the ionic<br>
currents typically only reach one to several hundred picoamperes. In<br>
order to measure such tiny currents, the resistance of the seal must be<br>
several orders of magnitude higher than for Xenopus Oocytes, namely in<br>
the range of 1-1000, preferably 10-1000 GigaOhm. As mentioned above,<br>
a person skilled in the art did assume that the edge or rim of a glass<br>
pipette must be pressed against the cell membrane in order to obtain<br>
such a gigaseal. This is also evident from US-Patent 6,048,722 that<br>
describes the additional, conventional use of biosensors including patch<br>
clamp pipettes and injection needles inside the recording chamber. This<br>
also requires additional micromanipulation with probes like electrodes,<br>
needles and patch clamp pipettes inside the recording chamber for<br>
holding of the Xenopus oocyte. These requirements lead to the same<br>
disadvantages as mentioned above.<br>
In summary, a person skilled in the art did previously assume that a<br>
gigaseal has to form between the cell membrane and the rim of a pipette<br>
tip that is approached to the membrane by mechanic force and hydraulic<br>
suction.<br>
As a consequence it is the object of the present invention to avoid the<br>
disadvantages of the state of the art technique. It shall represent a novel<br>
approach to achieve gigaseals between membrane and recording<br>
chamber or holding substrate required for the patch-clamp technique. It<br>
shall increase the mechanical stability of those seals. The need for<br>
visual microscopic control shall be eliminated. The invention shall<br>
achieve a small electric capacitance of the recording preparation,<br>
resulting in small dielectric fluctuations (noise) and a high time resolution<br>
of the measured signal. It shall allow measurements in multiple cells<br>
simultaneously and/or in rapid order with the patch clamp technique. The<br>
apparatus shall be easily automated and assembled using simple or<br>
already existing parts. The apparatus shall be miniaturized in order to<br>
arrange multiple recording preparations in parallel and integrate the<br>
apparatus into existing laboratory robot systems. The apparatus shall<br>
arrange multiple recording preparations independently in a way that<br>
recording chambers are arranged in a flexible array and chambers<br>
containing cells prepared for recording can be easily replaced and<br>
moved in said array. Multiple recording preparations shall be electrically<br>
shieldable from each other.<br>
The present invention at least partly solves the problems described<br>
above with the method as claimed in claim 1 and the apparatus as<br>
claimed in claim 12. Preferred embodiments of the method and/or the<br>
apparatus are described in claims 2-11 and 13-22. Claims 23-25 show<br>
use of a capillary, a capillary and kit. The wording of all claims is made<br>
part of the description by reference.<br>
The present invention provides a method where a cell is positioned in<br>
the lumen of a capillary and a sufficiently tight seal with a resistance<br>
exceeding 1 GigaOhm, preferably 10 GigaOhm is obtained between the<br>
cell membrane and the inner wall of the capillary. After achievement of<br>
the gigaseal a patch clamp experiment can be performed. The capillary<br>
is tapered in a way that it has along the length of the capillary at least at<br>
one site a smaller inner diameter than the outer diameter of the cell to be<br>
measured.<br>
Taper means a form of the capillary that allows holding a cell that is<br>
moved along the length of the capillary and avoids the passage of that<br>
cell. Taper can also mean a conical form of the capillary inner wall that<br>
encloses that cell circumferentially and allows for a close contact<br>
between the inner surface of the capillary and the cell surface. Therefore<br>
capillaries will be constructed with a preferentially round inner cross<br>
section that narrows along its length to a taper or nozzle in order to hold<br>
and position the cell and reach a tight seal between the cell surface and<br>
the inner surface of the tapered pipette. Obviously the inner diameter,<br>
form and steepness of the taper can be varied to allow for different cell<br>
diameters. By using very small inner diameters in the taper very small<br>
cells or subcellular membrane structures can be positioned and held, for<br>
example mitochondria, lysosomes or bacteria. These structures have so<br>
far not been accessible directly with the patch-clamp method, since they<br>
are usually too small for light microscopy and micromechanic<br>
manipulations. Therefore the term "cell" in the present invention includes<br>
any biological or artificial structure surrounded by a lipid membrane.<br>
In the present invention the term "positioning" describes any fixation of<br>
the cell in the taper or the capillary sufficient for patch-clamp<br>
experiments where a sufficiently tight bond or seal with a resistance<br>
exceeding 1, preferably 10 GigaOhm is achieved between cell<br>
membrane and inner surface of the capillary wall.<br>
It was surprising that a gigaseal - as required for measurements of ionic<br>
currents in small cells (e.g. mammalian cells, human, plant, insect cells)-<br>
can be obtained between the inner surface of a capillary lumen, and a<br>
cell membrane and that a patch clamp experiment can be performed on<br>
such cells after permeabilizing one side of the cell membrane and that<br>
additional probes like patch-clamp pipettes or injection needles are<br>
unnecessary to perform such experiments. With the invention the mere<br>
positioning of the cell in the narrow part of the capillary is sufficient and<br>
no additional devices like needles, patch-clamp pipettes or<br>
micromanipulators are required for obtaining a gigaseal. Further, the<br>
gigaseals obtained according to the invention are mechanically stable<br>
and can resist hydraulic and mechanical perturbations. It is routinely<br>
possible to remove the capillaries containing sealed cells from the holder<br>
of the capillary and move it to another holder without losing the gigaseal.<br>
Gigaseals are also resistant to mechanical vibrations, e.g. tapping<br>
against the capillary. Liquid can be flushed into the capillary using a<br>
narrow tube without breaking the seal.<br>
The length of the capillary is not critical for the present invention.<br>
Capillaries of entirely different length can be used. In a preferred<br>
embodiment the capillary is at least as long that the cell is positioned<br>
entirely inside the capillary.<br>
The above description shows that the narrow part or taper of the<br>
capillary can be realized in different ways. In a simple, preferred<br>
embodiment the entire capillary is tapered so that the inner diameter<br>
decreases gradually or stepwise along the length of the capillary. In this<br>
embodiment the cell will be positioned where the inner crossection<br>
diameter of the capillary taper approaches the outer cell diameter. In<br>
another preferred embodiment the narrowest crossection will be located<br>
at one end of the capillary, and the cell will be introduced into the<br>
capillary from the other end, so that the cell will be positioned and sealed<br>
inside the capillary close to the narrow opening.<br>
In another preferred embodiment the taper will be located at one end,<br>
and the cell will be introduced into the capillary from the other end, so<br>
that the cell will be positioned and sealed in the narrow opening and part<br>
of the cell protrudes from that opening. This allows a rapid exchange of<br>
solutions at the protruding part of the membrane.<br>
In a preferred embodiment the tapered capillaries can be so-called<br>
micropipettes similar to the various forms of micropipettes used for<br>
conventional patch-clamp experiments. A person skilled in the art knows<br>
how to fabricate and form such micropipettes. Typically micropipettes<br>
are pulled from glass capillaries after (at least local) heating by<br>
separation of both ends of the capillary in the melted middle section. The<br>
melting guarantees the required clean surface of the pipette material in<br>
order to obtain gigaseals.<br>
In a preferred embodiment the capillaries or micropipettes can be made<br>
from different non-conductive materials such as plastics (e.g.<br>
polystyrene). In another preferred embodiment of the invention the<br>
capillaries or micropipettes are made from glass. Glass has been shown<br>
to seal tightly to biological membranes and has good dielectrical<br>
properties. Glass is inert to a wide range of chemicals and can be easily<br>
cleaned. Furthermore, glass capillaries and micropipettes can be<br>
fabricated with a wide range of taper diameters at low cost with standard<br>
glass forming technology. Irrespective of the material, in preferred<br>
embodiments inner diameters of the taper/opening of the narrowest part<br>
below 50 micrometer, especially below 10 micrometer (mm), depending<br>
on the diameter of the examined biological structure or cell are used. A<br>
preferred lower limit for such diameter is 50 nanometer (nm).<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention cells are brought into and<br>
positioned inside the capillary by filling or flushing the capillary with a<br>
suspension of cells in solution. For example the cell suspension will be<br>
filled into the large opening of a micropipette and suction will be applied<br>
towards the narrow opening, leading to the positioning of a cell in the<br>
taper of the pipette. The positioning is achieved simply by movement of<br>
fluid and/or the cell. As soon as the first cell moves into the taper the<br>
contact between cell surface and inner wall of the capillary seals the cell<br>
to the capillary and blocks the liquid flow. Therefore no additional cells<br>
are moved into the taper. The introduction of cells into the capillary and<br>
the positioning of a cell in the taper is therefore achieved in a single<br>
step. According to the invention it is preferred to apply pressure<br>
gradients of 5 mbar (0.5 bar) to 1 bar, especially 5 mbar to 500 mbar.<br>
Alternatively or additionally in another embodiment of the invention the<br>
introduction and positioning of cells in the capillary can be achieved by<br>
sedimentation. In this case, the capillary is fixed in an upright direction<br>
and the cell is positioned by gravity, preferably in addition to the<br>
hydraulic flow described above.<br>
Alternatively or additionally in another embodiment of the invention the<br>
introduction and positioning of cells in the capillary can be achieved by<br>
centrifugation. In this case, a cell suspension is centrifuged into the<br>
capillary and the cell is positioned by centrifugal force, preferably in<br>
addition to the liquid flow described above. To obtain gigaseal with cells<br>
preferably centrifugation at 2 to 20 g is performed.. For bacteria and<br>
other small membrane structures below 1 micrometer diameter<br>
centrifugation at 10 to 500 g is preferable.<br>
Alternatively or additionally in another embodiment of the invention the<br>
introduction and positioning of cells in the capillary can be achieved or<br>
facilitated by mechanical vibration or by use of an electric field applied<br>
longitudinally along the capillary. Another embodiment uses magnetic<br>
beads coupled to or enclosed by the cells and positioning of said cell<br>
using a magnetic field. Another embodiment uses laser light (optical<br>
tweezers) in order to position the cell.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention, at least the tapered part of<br>
the capillary is first filled with a physiological solution (preferably cleaned<br>
by passage through a sterile filter or by centrifugation). The cell<br>
suspension is then layered on top of that solution. Subsequently, cells<br>
pass through the clean solution layer towards the taper by means of<br>
gravity, centrifugation etc. as described above. Since cells are in most<br>
cases heavier than membrane fragments and other typical<br>
contaminating particles in a cell suspension, this procedure allows the<br>
cells to be "rinsed" while entering the tapered part of the capillary.<br>
Furthermore, the probability of an intact cell to enter the narrow taper<br>
before any other particle is increased. This effectively reduces the risk of<br>
contamination of the inner surface of the pipette taper with particles that<br>
would otherwise prevent the subsequent formation of a gigaseal.<br>
In general, it is especially advantageous for preferred embodiements of<br>
the invention that the inner surface of the capillary is extremely clean for<br>
providing gigaseals, especially gigaseals with very high resistances. As<br>
a consequence, it is preferred to produce the capillary, especially at<br>
least the tapered/narrow part of such capillary with a very clean inner<br>
surface. Further, it is preferred to keep such inner surface extremely<br>
clean until the capillary is used for a patch-clamp experiment and even<br>
during such patch-clamp experiment.<br>
For producing gigaseals with cells inside capillaries according to the<br>
invention it is preferred to fulfil at least one of the following 4 technical<br>
requirements. Clearly, it is further preferred to fulfil all 4 technical<br>
requirements.<br>
1. Melting, preferably complete melting of the capillary during<br>
production of the taper/narrowing for guaranteeing submersion of<br>
any dust particles or contaminants beyond the inner surface.<br>
2. Avoidance of contamination of the inner surface by keeping the<br>
capillary in an extremely clean environment after production, e.g.<br>
by sealing it in a sterile containment under a flow of filtered air<br>
(preferably 0.2 micrometer pore size).<br>
3. Avoidance of contamination of the inner surface during the<br>
experiment, e.g. by filling at least the taper with a sterile-filtered<br>
solution, e.g. a physiological salt solution.<br>
4. Avoidance of contamination of the inner surface during the<br>
experiment stemming from contaminating particles in the cell<br>
suspension by sedimentation and/or centrifugation of cells through<br>
said layer of a sterile-filtered solution.<br>
In preferred embodiments the following parameters are measured in<br>
said positioned cell or membrane structure: current in voltage-clamp,<br>
voltage in current-clamp, electric resistance, impedance, electric<br>
capacity, optic fluorescence, plasmon resonance, mechanic resonance,<br>
fluidity and/or rigidity.<br>
In preferred embodiments the positioning of the cell can be verified<br>
and/or controlled before performing a patch-clamp experiment. This can<br>
be achieved by optical means, for example by analysis of laser light<br>
illuminating the taper of the capillary. In this context said cell can be<br>
stained with dyes, dye-coupled antibodies, ligands, lipids etc. The dye<br>
can be chosen to indicate chemical variations inside the cell or at the cell<br>
surface and thus yield biological information in addition to the position of<br>
the cell in the capillary, for example chemical changes in the cytosol.<br>
Preferably, the positioning of the cell is controlled and verified by<br>
measuring pressure and/or flow through the capillary. Changes in<br>
pressure and/or flow indicate positioning of a cell in the capillary taper.<br>
Pressure and flow can be regulated, preferably automatically, in order to<br>
achieve the desired positioning of a cell and the tight seal between<br>
membrane and inner capillary surface. Further preferred, the electrical<br>
resistance along the capillary is measured in order to assess the position<br>
of the cell respective to the taper and to measure the quality of the seal.<br>
The positioning forces can then be regulated in order to improve the<br>
resistance of the seal. By this means hydraulic or centrifugation forces<br>
can be controlled in order to achieve an optimal seal between the<br>
membrane of different cell types and the inner capillary surface.<br>
According to the invention a new capillary or micropipette can be used<br>
for each patch-clamp experiment. This guarantees a new, extremely<br>
clean surface for positioning and sealing a new cell. In another preferred<br>
embodiment the capillary is reused after a patch clamp experiment. For<br>
this purpose the cell is removed from the capillary by suction / flushing.<br>
Subsequently the capillary is cleaned and prepared for another patch-<br>
clamp experiment. Cleaning of the capillary is preferably done by<br>
flushing with solvents or chemicals. Additionally or alternatively heat and<br>
ultrasound can be used to clean the capillary inner surface.<br>
It is obvious to a person skilled in the art that the claimed method can be<br>
modified in several ways. For example, solution exchange can be<br>
performed on both sides of the cell after sealing said cell to the inner<br>
wall of the capillary. Solution exchange can be performed using tubes or<br>
outlets for suction and/or flushing etc. Futhermore, the membrane can<br>
be permeabilized selectively on one side of the seal. To achieve this,<br>
pressure changes, ultrasound, electric voltage jumps or permeabilizing<br>
chemicals (e.g. ionophors, tensides, enzymes, solvents) can be used.<br>
They can be applied through said solution exchange devices. Selective<br>
permeabilization of one membrane surface can render the inner side of<br>
the other membrane surface accessible to substances applied to the<br>
capillary and can reduce the electric resistance accessing the other<br>
membrane surface. According to the invention for rupture of the<br>
membrane no additional probes like needles nor mechanical movement<br>
of such probes is required.<br>
Obviously a variety of different cell types can be examined with the<br>
present method. According to the invention it is preferred to use cells or<br>
subcellular structures (as mentioned above) having diameters below 100<br>
mm, preferably below 50 mm. Use of cells or structures with diameters<br>
from 30 mm to 3 mm is further preferred.<br>
To name a few, cells that can be examined include Jurkat lymphoma<br>
cells, HEK293 cells, Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, primary cells<br>
from neuronal tissue like hippocampus, ganglion, neuroendocrine cells<br>
etc.; skeletal muscle, smooth muscle, heart muscle, immune cells;<br>
epithelia and endothelia etc. Furthermore, cells can be genetically<br>
engineered. For example, ion transport proteins can be expressed in cell<br>
lines, e.g. CHO cells. In a preferred embodiment genetic material like<br>
DNA or RNA can be harvested from the capillary following the patch-<br>
clamp experiment.<br>
In another embodiment the presented method can be used to examine<br>
artificial or natural lipid vesicles. Preferably ion transport proteins,<br>
possibly genetically modified proteins, can be inserted into these<br>
vesicles. Furthermore, subcellular membrane structures (e.g.<br>
mitochondria, lysosomes, endoplasmic reticulum, nuclei), plant cells and<br>
prokaryotic cells (e.g. bacteria) can be examined, since in contrast to the<br>
state of the art patch-clamp technique structures with diameters well<br>
beyond 1 micrometer can be positioned and sealed.<br>
In a preferred embodiment material is collected/harvested from the<br>
positioned cell, possibly proteins, lipids, RNA, DNA, enzymes and other<br>
molecules.<br>
The invention further comprises a new apparatus for patch-clamp<br>
experiments on cells or other membrane structures preferably for<br>
applying the method described above. This apparatus comprises at least<br>
one capillary, at least one device for delivering a cell into said capillary<br>
lumen and positioning of said cell inside the capillary and eventually<br>
other usual devices required to perform a patch clamp measurement.<br>
Said capillary is tapered in a way that along the length of the capillary at<br>
least one site has a smaller inner diameter than the outer diameter of the<br>
cell to be measured. Furthermore the capillary is designed in a way that<br>
a cell can be introduced into said capillary lumen and positioned in order<br>
to obtain a gigaseal between the cellular membrane and the inner<br>
surface of the capillary. The design of the apparatus and its advantages<br>
relate directly to the method described above and the method"s<br>
description is explicit part of the description of said apparatus.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention the apparatus contains<br>
devices that allow flushing and draining the capillary lumen with at least<br>
one solution or cell suspension. For this purpose liquid containers like<br>
reservoirs, tubes for feeding and draining the capillary, pumps for<br>
suspensions and solutions, pipettes, valves and pressure/flow gauges<br>
can be implemented.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention the flushing/draining devices<br>
are complemented or replaced by a device designed to centrifuge the<br>
cells into the capillary.<br>
The apparatus may contain devices to measure the electrical resistance<br>
(e.g. electrodes preferably made from chloride-silver or carbon fibers<br>
and cabling) or devices to analyze optical properties of the cell/capillary<br>
system, preferably laser light sources, optical fibers, and light detectors.<br>
Said devices can be used in order to control and adjust positioning of the<br>
cell inside the capillary.<br>
The advantages of the invention are most obvious in a preferred<br>
embodiment of the invention, where multiple tapered capillaries,<br>
preferably micropipettes, are used. The capillaries can be arranged<br>
preferably in a regularly spaced array. In this way the patch-clamp<br>
method can be automated, since cells sealed in capillaries can be<br>
examined either simultaneously or in a rapid sequential order.<br>
In the embodiments with multiple capillaries cells can be positioned<br>
inside said capillaries in a first step. Since the positioned cells are<br>
mechanically protected and firmly sealed, cell-containing capillaries can<br>
be transferred in a second step into a measuring device. Furthermore,<br>
cell-containing capillaries can be replaced if the sealing attempt or the<br>
attempt to open the membrane fails. In this embodiment an array of<br>
positioned, sealed and opened cells can be assembled.<br>
In the embodiments with multiple capillaries such capillaries can be<br>
easily electrically shielded from each other and from the environment. In<br>
this context preferably grounded shields from metal or any other<br>
conductive material can be used in closing the capillaries. Such shields<br>
e.g. can be in the form of cylindrical tubes partly or completely enclosing<br>
the capillaries.<br>
In the embodiments with multiple capillaries preferably multiple liquid<br>
containers are used, preferably microwells, that hold suspensions or<br>
solutions with cells and compounds. These containers can be wells in a<br>
microtiter plate. Preferably the number and arrangement of containers<br>
relates to the capillary array. This allows to transfer liquid from a defined<br>
well into a corresponding capillary, for example using piston stroke<br>
pipettes.<br>
In the embodiments described the capillaries and the liquid containers<br>
are preferably arranged or moved in a way, that suspensions or<br>
solutions including cell suspensions can be easily transferred into the<br>
capillary lumen. The figures and figure descriptions provide examples for<br>
such arrangements.<br>
In a preferred embodiment at least one capillary in the apparatus is<br>
tapered in a way that along the length of the capillary at least one site<br>
has a smaller inner diameter than the outer diameter of the cell to be<br>
measured in order to apply the method described in the present<br>
invention. The capillary is preferably made of glass and is preferably a<br>
micropipette.<br>
The described features and specifications as well as other features and<br>
specifications result from the following experimental protocol and the<br>
figure descriptions. Different features can be implemented in said<br>
experimental protocol or figures alone or in combination.<br>

Fig. 1 illustrates the differences between the invented method and the<br>
state of the art regular patch-clamp technique. Fig. 1A shows attachment<br>
(seal) of a cell to the tip of a micropipette with the conventional patch-<br>
clamp method. The seal forms between the rim of the pipette opening<br>
and the cell membrane. The arrow indicates the direction of suction/flow,<br>
after pressing the pipette tip against the cell and applying vacuum to the<br>
pipette interior. Fig. 1B shows positioning and sealing a cell with the<br>
invented method. The arrows indicate the direction of flow and/or<br>
movement of cells when suspended cells, in Fig. 1B for example three<br>
cells, are moved towards the tip of the micropipette. Fig. 1 B further<br>
shows a cell sealed to the inner wall of the tapered pipette. A patch-<br>
clamp experiment can be performed on this cell. In contrast to the state<br>
of the art the invented method does not require to move the micropipette<br>
towards the cell. The cells are flushed into the pipette lumen and<br>
positioned in the taper. This method is not only simple, but also<br>
eliminates the need for a microscope to control positioning and a<br>
micromanipulator to position the micropipette. This allows in any case to<br>
miniaturize and automate the apparatus.<br>
Fig. 2 shows a capillary and a cell positioned and sealed according to<br>
the invented method. The capillary is constructed as a thin tube (outer<br>
diameter 1.5 mm, inner diameter 1.2 mm) and in the example shown it<br>
tapers down to a small opening (0.5 - 1 mm). In this taper a cell<br>
(diameter ˜ 10 mm) is positioned and its membrane is sealed to the inner<br>
surface of the taper preferably consisting of glass. The two small lines in<br>
the opening of the taper symbolize permeabilization of the cell<br>
membrane on the right side. In both sides of the capillary thin tubes for<br>
flushing/draining solutions and suspensions are inserted (outer diameter<br>
0.2 mm, inner diameter 0.1 mm). The arrows indicate direction of liquid<br>
flow. These flushing/draining devices can be either used to fill cell<br>
suspension into the capillary (left in- and outlet), or to drain cell<br>
suspension, for example after an experiment (left in- and outlet).<br>
Furthermore, the tubes can be used for cleaning of the capillary (left and<br>
right in- and outlets) or for application of pharmacological substances,<br>
membrane permeabilizing chemicals and other compounds (left and<br>
right in- and outlets). In addition electrodes are inserted into the capillary<br>
lumen (for example chlorided silver wire, outer diameter 0.2 mm) that<br>
serve electrical measurements of current and/or voltage and injection of<br>
current. The dimensions of the capillary, the taper and the in- and outlets<br>
can be adjusted to the respective requirements, e.g. to the diameter of<br>
cell types with different size.<br>
Fig. 3 shows how the cell membrane can be permeabilized on both<br>
sides of the circumferential seal. i.e., the cell membrane can be<br>
rendered permeable either on the narrowing entry side of the taper or on<br>
the exit side. The permeabilization is symbolized by double lines.<br>
Corresponding information was given in the above description.<br>
Fig. 4 shows two additional, alternative models of tapered capillaries<br>
with a cell sealed in the narrow part, respectively. The left panel of Fig. 4<br>
shows a taper, that folds backward exposing a round rim or edge at the<br>
narrowest part of the capillary. The right panel shows a capillary with an<br>
hour-glass-like shape, shown in Fig. 4 in the way that the taper is<br>
symmetrically mirrored to both sides of the narrowest position. The<br>
features described in Fig. 4 are herewith explicitly claimed as part of the<br>
description of the invention.<br>
Fig. 5 shows a sketch of an apparatus according to the invention. A<br>
glass capillary 1 formed as a micropipette similar to the model shown in<br>
Fig. 2 is shown. In the nozzle-like part of the tapered capillary 1 a cell is<br>
positioned for experiments. In- and outlets 2 are inserted in both ends of<br>
the capillary lumen at both sides of the cell. These in- and outlets are<br>
connected to pumps and pressure/flow gauges 3 that serve to transfer<br>
liquids between reservoirs 5 and capillary 1 and measure pressures<br>
and/or flow rates. Electrodes 8 are inserted into both sides of the<br>
capillary 1. These electrodes are represented by lines below the<br>
in/outlets also in (Fig. 2.)<br>
A laser light source 6 and a light detector 7 are shown in Fig. 5. They<br>
serve to control positioning and fixation of the cell in capillary 1. All<br>
respective elements are electronically connected to a controlling device<br>
4 that contains a computer and records data, performs voltage and/or<br>
current clamp (see below), analyzes data, and controls and regulates<br>
the apparatus.<br>
Figs. 6 and 7 show an apparatus, where multiple capillaries are<br>
assembled. The capillaries are arranged in a planar, regular array and<br>
can be positioned by the apparatus above a respective array of multiple<br>
reservoirs. These reservoirs can be microvessels in a microtiter plate<br>
like shown in Fig. 6 and 7. The larger openings of the pipettes point<br>
towards the microvessels and can be moved into those vessels. The<br>
vessels can be filled with suspensions of cells. In the lower part of Fig. 6<br>
the suspensions are sucked into the pipettes. In Fig. 7 suspended cells<br>
are moved towards the pipette tips by centrifugation. For this purpose<br>
the pipette array holder is mounted in a rotor. By rotation the centrifugal<br>
force moves the cells towards the narrow part of the pipettes. The lower<br>
part of Fig. 7 shows another microtiter plate. The vessels in this plate<br>
can be filled with solutions of pharmacological substances. The cell-<br>
holding pipette array can dip into the vessels in order to test<br>
pharmacological compounds. Alternatively or additionally, substances or<br>
solutions thereof can be transferred from vessels into cell-holding<br>
micropipettes by liquid handling devices, for example pipetting robots.<br>
Figs. 8 and 9 are discussed in the following description of an<br>
experiment.<br>
Description of an experiment<br>
Patch-clamp micropipettes with dimensions as described in Fig. 2 were<br>
pulled from borosilicate glass (Clark Electromedical Instruments,<br>
Reading, UK) using a microprocessor controlled puller (Zeitz<br>
Instrumente, Augsburg, FRG). Pipette tips were fire polished in the puller<br>
down to a tip resistance of 2-3 MegaOhm in an aqueous solution<br>
containing 150 mM NaCI. To reduce electric capacitance some pipette<br>
tips were coated on their outer surface with silicon rubber or paraffin.<br>
Measurements were performed using an EPC9 patch-clamp amplifier<br>
(HEKA, Lambrecht, FRG) for voltage clamp and data aquisition. The<br>
data were digitized at 10 kHz and filtered at 2 kHz. Analysis was<br>
performed using software from HEKA. "Voltage clamp" means a usual<br>
technique for the control of electric parameters during a patch-clamp<br>
measurement. A high-resistance feedback-circuitry injects exactly the<br>
amount of current into the biological preparation so that the voltage<br>
remains at the desired value. The analog circuitry features high time-<br>
resolution and permits compensation of capacitive currents, series<br>
resistance and leak currents that shall be distinguished from the ionic<br>
currents flowing through the examined membrane structures.<br>
The pipette was filled with a sterile-filtered modified Ringer solution<br>
containing 145 mM NaCI, 5 mM KCI, 2 mM CaCI2, 1 mM MgCI2, 10 mM<br>
glucose and 10 mM HEPES (pH 7,4). The pipette was electrically<br>
connected to the pre-amplifier via a silverwire coated with AgCI. 100-500<br>
Jurkat T cells (ATCC, VA, USA) with a diameter of approximately 5 mm<br>
suspended in approx. 10 mm RPMI medium were introduced into the<br>
micropipette using a fine glass tube. The pipette tip was then dipped into<br>
a bath containing the ground electrode. Resistance was measured with<br>
a 5 mV voltage step (see Fig. 8a). A pressure of 0.5 bar was applied to<br>
the pipette flushing the cells towards the pipette tip. The pressure<br>
gradient was removed as soon as the electric resistance of the pipette<br>
increased indicating the positioning of a cell in the pipette taper (Fig.<br>
8 b).<br>
This type of experiment could reproduce gigaseals between pipette<br>
interior and cell membrane. Like with the conventional patch-clamp<br>
method the electric resistance was in the range &gt; 10 Gigaohm (see Fig.<br>
8 c).<br>
This experiment further demonstrates that the cell is positioned in the<br>
narrowing taper of the pipette as demonstrated in the microphotograph<br>
shown in Fig. 9. Application of either a short pressure pulse (1 bar, 200<br>
ms) or a voltage jump (500 mV, 0.1 ms) perforated the cell membrane<br>
on one side. This was obvious from the increase in capacitive charge<br>
movements (current transients). The gigaseal was typically stable over<br>
extended time periods (10 - &gt;60 min.) and was even resistant to<br>
mechanical vibrations purposely applied to the micropipette.<br>
The experiment described here shows unequivocally, that by introducing<br>
a cell into a glass capillary featuring a narrow taper a stable gigaseal can<br>
be obtained between cell membrane and the inner surface of the pipette<br>
wall. The resistance and stability of the seal are high enough to achieve<br>
the advantages described.<br>
