				<td>Technical field<br>
The invention relates to a unidirectional textile reinforcing sheath and more specifically to that of textiles used to form reinforcing sheaths. Such textiles therefore take the form of tapes, which can be wound onto a mechanical structure to be reinforced. Mention may be made, as an example, of the reinforcements of pipes used in the field of the transport of fluids under pressure. These pipes are subjected to-especially high stresses in terms of weight and pressure for them to have especially high capacities in terms of mechanical resistance.<br>
The  invention  is  aimed at  improving  the  bursting resistance performance of such pipes.<br>
Prior art<br>
In general terms,  in all pipes used for applications ensuring the transport of gas or fluids under pressure, bursting resistance is imparted by ensuring the taping of a pipe produced from polymeric material with a high-performance textile tape wound helically. In general, the tapes used are produced on the basis of high-strength threads, such as aramid threads, glass threads or carbon fibers, but also polyester, polyethylene or polyamide  threads.  These  textile  tapes are usually warped unidirectional tapes, and they are obtained by weaving with weft threads of very low linear density, in order to limit contraction.<br><br>
These tapes are subsequently arranged on the initial pipe by means of an application system which ensures that contiguous turns are produced. A plurality of layers may be necessary in order to ensure optimum reinforcement. However, it is often found that the accuracy of these application machines is unsufficient to ensure the exactly contiguous application of the various turns of tape. It may therefore happen that the space separating the tape having a width of the order of about ten centimeters amounts to several millimeters. The presence of this gap allows the taped pipe to undergo deformation by creep under the effect of high pressures and therefore to generate a bulge within the taping. This bulge is obviously a point of weakness, particularly in terms of shearing, on which are concentrated very high mechanical stresses which may ultimately lead to the bursting of the pipe. This is why solutions based on glass threads are not suitable. Another disadvantage of glass is that it requires certain handling precautions in order to preserve its intactness. Thus, as compared with synthetic threads, glass threads do not have sufficient flexibility to be capable of being wound or folded, while at the same time maintaining a proportionate resistance.<br>
Conversely, it may happen that, because of the low accuracy of the machines for applying the tape, two successive turns of tape overlap slightly, thus forming a localized overthickness. This overthickness is subsequently increased as a result of the winding of the additional layers and consequently forms a point of embrittlement of the pipe. Phenomena involving relative slip between layers are likewise a source of embrittlement.<br><br>
One object of the invention is to make it possible to produce a taping which has excellent bursting resistance in spite of the use of application machines of limited accuracy.<br>
Presentation of the invention<br>
The invention therefore relates to a reinforcing sheath capable of being taped onto a mechanical structure to be reinforced. This sheath takes the form of a tape produced by the weaving of high-strength warp threads based on high-performance synthetic threads, such as aramids.<br>
According to the invention, this tape is defined in that it has a central zone bordered by two lateral zones, the thickness of which is less than the thickness of the central zone. In other words, the tape has lateral borders which are thinner than the central zone, thus allowing a slight overlap of the wound tape, without generating any overthickness, or at least with this possible overthickness being limited.<br>
Thus, during taping, the application machine can be set in order to bring about this slight overlap which makes it possible to prevent the formation of bulges, of which the detrimental consequences in terms of bursting resistance were seen above. This slight overlap occurs without any pronounced overthickness, which was likewise seen above to be a disadvantage of the existing reinforcing tapes which have a constant thickness over their entire width.<br>
In practice, the threads present in the lateral zones may have a linear density lower than those present in the central zone or, more generally, may have a lesser thickness than the threads used to form the central zone.<br><br>
According to another characteristic of the invention, in these lateral zones, threads may be used which possess a capacity for elongation under traction which is greater than that of the threads of the central zone. Thus, the borders of the tape can undergo slight deformation in the overlap zones and therefore distribute the mechanical stresses in these particular zones.<br>
In some embodiments, twisted threads can be used in the central zone, whereas the threads present in the border zones are twist-free or have a very limited twist, so as to optimize the relative elongations between the lateral zones and the central zone.<br>
Advantageously, in practice, the weft threads used may be threads comprising at least one thermoplastic fraction, making it possible to ensure a slight bonding of the warp threads and therefore to hold the assembly when the tape has undergone a heating operation.<br>
In practice, the widths of each lateral zone represent approximately 2 to 2 0% of the total width of the tape.<br>
In a particular embodiment, one of the faces of the tape may have applied to it a film of thermoplastic material which makes it possible to ensure the protection of the tape with respect to the other layers and to protect the fibers with respect to ultraviolet rays, particularly when the threads used are based on aramid.<br>
Brief description of the figures<br>
How the invention is implemented and the advantages which emanate from it may be gathered from the description of the embodiment given by way of example, with reference to the single accompanying figure which is a concise diagrammatic perspective view of a tape according to the invention.<br><br>
Implementation of the invention<br>
The  warped  unidirectional  tape  (1)  described  in figure 1 has a central zone (2) and two lateral zones (3, 4) forming the borders of the tape. The various warp threads (5, 6, 7) are woven with weft threads (8).<br>
In practice, in the form illustrated, the central zone (2) has a width of between 10 and 200 mm, while the lateral zones (3, 4) have a width of the order of approximately 3 to 10 millimeters.<br>
The thickness of the warp threads (5) of the central zone is relatively large, of the order of 0.8 to 1 mm, while the warp threads (6, 7) present in the lateral zones (3, 4) have a thickness of the order of 0.3 to 0.5 mm.<br>
Good results were obtained using threads based on aramid, meta-aramid or para-aramid as warp threads (5) in the central zone. However, the invention also embraces the use of threads considered as equivalent to aramid in terms of mechanical resistance combined with high flexibility. This applies to synthetic threads, such as aromatic polyester or high-strength polyethylene, or to special threads, such as those based on liquid crystals.<br>
The warp threads (5) may be multifilament threads with or without twist, or twist threads, with a linear density ranging from 330 to 680 tex, and, for example, with a twist of 60 turns, and preferably with an alternation of twisted threads in the direction Z and in the direction S. This use of two twist directions makes it possible to preserve the planeness of the tape and prevent kinking phenomena.<br><br>
The warp threads (6, 7) used in the lateral zones (3, 4) may be continuous threads or threads obtained from spun fibers, so as to possess an elongation greater than the threads of the central zone. The same aramid threads may be used in the lateral zones as those used for the central zone. In practice, it is thus possible to produce tapes which have excellent mechanical properties of tensile strength, typically of the order of or greater than one tonne per centimeter of width.<br>
In this weaving of high-modulus tape, in terms of weft, the threads used may be, for example, polyester threads coated with a thermoplastic material, so as to possess a linear density of the order of 40 tex, or else glass threads with a coating based on thermoplastic material. These threads then possess a linear density of the order of 20 to 70 tex and are twist-free. It should be noted that the weft threads have a linear density markedly lower than those of the warp threads, typically in a ratio of at least 1 to 10, in order to generate the lowest possible contraction for the warp threads. The functionality of these weft threads is to ensure that the geometric arrangement of the warp threads is maintained, even under slight tension during the subsequent handling and employment of the tape. This weft thread may be single or double at each insertion, depending on the choice of weaving material. This weft thread runs alternatively over the entire width of the fabric, at the same time being continuous over the entire length of the tape, without the need, therefore, for stitching or for the formation of selvages.<br>
It may be gathered from the above that the tape according to the invention can be taped, with overlap zones being generated which ensure a continuity of reinforcement over the entire overlapped surface. These overlap zones, however, do not generate any overthickness or zones forming brittle points, as is<br><br>
the case with tapes of the prior art. The overlap of the lateral zones allows the use of less complex and more rapid laying means than those used hitherto, hence with savings in terms of manufacturing cost.<br>
This tape can be used in very many applications in which it is either used as such or alternatively impregnated with a heat-setting resin. It can therefore be used in the manufacture of pipes, tubes and other parts of revolution, but also in the reinforcement of existing structures, such as bridge piers.<br><br><br><br><br>
