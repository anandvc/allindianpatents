DESCRIPTION<br><br><br><br>
GRAB RAIL FOR MOTORCYCLE<br><br><br><br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br><br>
The present invention relates to a grab rail for a motorcycle. Priority is claimed on Japanese Patent Application No. 2003-97321, filed March 31, 2003, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.<br><br><br><br>
BACKGROUND ART<br><br>
There is a motorcycle having a grab rail which is provided on left and right side covers and which includes a cross member portion positioned at a higher level than a seat surface (for example, refer to a pamphlet of PCT International Publication<br><br>
No.W002/055367).<br><br>
This cross member portion is disposed along the widthwise direction of a vehicle and is used for supporting a vehicle body, for example, when operating a main stand and so on. Accordingly, the cross member portion is disposed at a higher level than the seat surface such that it can be gripped easily and such that it will not interfere with the seat when it is gripped.<br><br>
However, in the conventional grab rail for a motorcycle described above, when placing a load on the seat, if the load falls into a place on the seat, there is no problem. However, when the load is large and projects rearwardly of the seat, it is difficult to place the load due to difference in levels between the seat and the rear portion of the grab rail.<br><br>
In addition, when the load is large and projects from the rear portion of the grab rail rearwardly, if the motorcycle travels in a state in which the load is in contact with the<br><br><br>
2<br><br>
upper surface of a lamp, the load may interfere with the lamp due to vibration.<br><br><br><br>
DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION<br><br>
Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to provide a grab rail which will not interrupt placing a load, which prevents interfere of the load with the lamp, and which is convenient to grip.<br><br>
In order to achieve the above object, the present invention provides a grab rail mounted to a motorcycle having a seat, side covers, and a lamp provided at the rearmost position of a vehicle body, including: a rear portion; a left side portion and a right side portion each extending continuously and forwardly from both of left and right sides of the rear portion; attaching portions provided inside the left side portion and the right side portion such that the attaching portions protrude, for attaching to side faces of the side covers below the seat, wherein: the grab rail is formed, corresponding to the shape of the lamp, such that a range from the attaching portions to a portion above the lamp overlaps the lamp at least partly in plan view; an inner edge of the rear portion of the grab rail extends rearwardly from a position of a rear end of the seat to define a space between the rear end of the seat and the inner edge of the rear portion in plan view; an outer surface of the grab rail is formed inclining gradually toward the rear direction, such that the outer surface faces sideward at a position below the seat while the outer surface faces upward at the rearmost portion of the grab rail; and an upper surface at the rearmost portion of the grab rail is positioned substantially on an extension line of the upper surface of the seat.<br><br>
In this arrangement, since the grab rail functions as a member for protecting the lamp, it prevents the lamp from being gripped by mistake when an occupant grips the grab rail, and serves as a protecting member.<br><br><br>
3<br><br>
In addition, in the grab rail, the outer surface changes continuously toward the rear direction; and in view of the positional relationship with the seat, the outer surface is located substantially on the extension line of the upper surface of the seat at the rearmost portion so that the grab rail protrudes from the seat surface at the same level in appearance. Therefore, continuity in appearance can be maintained.<br><br>
In addition, even when the grab rail is positioned substantially on the extension line of the upper surface of the seat and thus the positional relation between the seat and the grab rail is flat, since there is a space defined between the seat and the grab rail and, more specifically, between the rear end of the seat and the inner edge of the rear portion of the grab rail, it is easy to insert one's hand and, in addition, since they are in flat relation in terms of position, it is easy to place a load thereon.<br><br>
Furthermore, even when the load placed on the seat is large and thus protrudes rearward from the seat so as to cross over the grab rail, since there is no difference in levels between the upper surface of the rearmost portion of the grab rail and the upper surface of the seat, the load can be placed across both of them in a stable manner, and the load will not interfere with the lamp.<br><br>
The grab rail of the present invention may be formed into a substantially U-shape in plan view.<br><br>
In this arrangement, the grab rail can be formed of a single member having a shape which is convenient for gripping, as a grab rail having an advantage in the strength. And the appearance quality thereof can also be improved.<br><br>
The grab rail of the present invention may have portions protruding forwardly from the attaching portions which are attached to the side covers located below the seat, and being cantilevered.<br><br>
In this arrangement, the portions to be gripped can be elongated without<br><br><br>
4<br><br>
providing additional attaching portions; and the shapes thereof can be convenient for griping. In addition, they can be used as a standing handle.<br><br>
The grab rail of the present invention may be mounted to the side covers in a state in which, in plan view, a space is provided at between the grab rail and the side covers.<br><br>
In this arrangement, it is possible to insert one's hand easily into a space provided with respect to the side covers.<br><br>
The grab rail of the present invention may have a stopper portion formed at each distal end of the left side portion and the right side portion.<br><br>
Especially, gaps may be formed between inner end surfaces of the stopper portions and outer surfaces of the side covers.<br><br>
In this arrangement, there is no need to form recessed portions to the side covers for mounting or gripping the grab rail or the like; and furthermore, there is no influence on the appearance of the side covers. In addition, in this arrangement, cloth of an occupant can be prevented from being caught; and furthermore, a rope for fixing the load located on the grab rail can be passed easily through between them.<br><br>
The stoppers may have hook shape.<br><br>
In this arrangement, the stopper portions may also serve as hooks for fixing loads.<br><br>
Furthermore, in the motorcycle to which the grab rail of the present invention is mounted, the lamp provided at the rearmost of the vehicle body of the motorcycle may have a light-emitting face at an upper surface thereof.<br><br>
In this arrangement, visibility towards the rear direction can be improved.<br><br><br><br>

BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br><br>
Hereinafter, an embodiment of the present invention will be described with reference to the figures. In FIG. 1 to FIG. 5, a vehicle body frame F which is a basic structure of a motorcycle, includes a front frame Ff and a rear frame Fr integrally connected with each other. In a vehicle, the front frame Ff has a head pipe 1 and a main pipe 2 extending rearward and downward from the head pipe I. A front fork 3 having a front wheel Wf mounted thereon is supported by the head pipe 1, and a handle 4 is fixed at the upper end of the front fork 3. An engine unit Eu is suspended from and supported<br><br><br>
6<br><br>
by the lower end of the main pipe 1 and the lower end of a supporting frame 5 extending downwardly from the main pipe 1.<br><br>
The rear frame Fr includes a rear pipe 10 and bifurcated seat frames 11 disposed upwardly thereof. The front end of the rear pipe 10 is integrally connected to the rear end of the front frame Ff and extends upwardly toward the rear; and the seat rails 11 extend above the rear pipe 10 rearward and almost horizontally. The front portions of the seat rails 11 are connected by a cross pipe 12, and the rear ends thereof are connected by a tail frame 13, which serves as a mounting frame of a grab rail G which will be described later.<br><br>
A swing arm 15 is supported at the rear portion of the engine unit Eu so as to be capable of a vertical swinging motion, and a rear wheel Wr is rotatably supported by the rear end of the swing arm 15. A rear cushion 14 is connected between the swing arm 15 and the rear wheel Wr. And, most part of the vehicle body frame F including the front frame Ff and the rear frame Fr is covered by a vehicle body cover formed of synthetic resin plate or metal plate.<br><br>
A fuel tank T is accommodated between the seat rails 11, and flanges 16 overhanging outwardly from the side surface of the fuel tank T is fixedly supported by the seat rails 11 with a plurality of bolts 17. A seat S is mounted on the rear frame Fr so as to be capable of a derricking motion, and covers the fuel tank T. The seat S employed here is a seat for two occupants capable of tandem traveling (riding double), and includes seating surfaces on a front portion S 1 and a rear portion S2. The rear portion S2 can be used as a space for placing a load.<br><br>
The tail frame 13 of the rear frame Fr is formed on the rear side of the fuel tank T into a U-shape opened toward the rear in cross section, and left and right lower portions are fixed to the rear frame Fr by welding. The grab rail G is mounted to the<br><br><br>
7<br><br>
left and the right side surfaces of the tail frame 13.<br><br>
The grab rail G is formed of aluminum alloy by casting and has a sufficient rigidity required for supporting the weight of the occupant. As shown in FIG. 3, it is formed into a substantially U-shape opened toward the front in plan view. The grab rail includes a rear portion 20 formed into an arcuate shape and provided at a rear portion of the rear frame Fr, and left and right side portions 21 and 22 extending continuously from the left and the right sides of the rear portion 20 toward the front of the rear frame Fr. A pair of inwardly protruding stoppers 21s and 22s is formed symmetrically and integrally at the distal ends of the left and the right side portions 21 and 22, that is, at insides of the free ends thereof. Moreover, the stoppers 21s and 22s may be formed into various shapes such as a hook shape, or a spherical shape. Furthermore, the stoppers 21s and 22s may be protruded downward, or obliquely downward.<br><br>
A pair of brackets (attaching portions) 21 b and 22b are formed integrally at the lower ends inside the longitudinal midsections of the left and the right side portions 21 and 22 of the grab rail G, and these brackets 21b and 22b are secured to the tail frame 13, that is, to the left and the right side surfaces of the seat frame 11 together with side covers C which constitute a part of the vehicle body cover, by means of at least two bolts 24 disposed at the front and the rear and penetrating the grab rail G. And, front halves of the left and the right side portions 21 and 22 of the grab rail G are extended along the outer surfaces of the side covers C so that the portions extending forwardly from mounting portions 25 are cantilevered.<br><br>
As shown in FIG. 5 to FIG. 7, the grab rail G is formed in plan view so as to extend along the shape of a lamp 7 which will be described later, and below the seat 5, an outer surface M which faces almost sideward as shown in FIG. 7 inclines gradually toward the rear so that the rearmost portion faces upwards as shown in FIG. 10 (see FIG.<br><br><br>
8<br><br>
8 to FIG. 10). At the rearmost portion, the outer surface M constitutes an upper surface<br><br>
H of the grab rail G and is located substantially on an extension line L of the upper surface of the seat S (see FIG. 2).<br><br>
The rear portions of the side surfaces of the side covers C gradually decrease in lateral width toward the rear, and the rear ends thereof extend upward to form a rear cover RC. The lamp 7 is disposed at the rear of the side covers C, that is, at the rearmost position of the vehicle body. The lamp 7, including a tail lamp 7a at the center, and turn signals 7b and 7b disposed in a fiat with the tail lamp 7a on the left and the right sides thereof, is narrowed toward the rear, and the center portion thereof projects toward the rear. The shapes of the rear cover RC and the grab rail G are formed such that they also project toward the rear at the center, as will be described later, so as to match the shape of the lamp 7.<br><br>
In addition, as shown in FIG. 11, the lamp 7 is attached via a clip portion 31 to a rear fender 30 having a license plate 8 attached at the lower portion thereof The clip portion 31 is attached to a lamp body 32 via a grommet 37. A bulb 33 is attached to the upper portion of the lamp body 32, and a reflector 34 is attached to the lower portion of the lamp body 32. A lens 35 including a rear surface 35B extending obliquely upward and rearward at the position corresponding to the bulb 33, and an upper surface 35A extending frontward, is disposed on the lamp body 32; and a lamp cover 36 is attached to the boundary with respect to the reflector 34 so as to cover the lens 35. Moreover, although the lamp 7 having the center portion projecting rearward is described as an example, the shape of the lamp 7 is not limited thereto, and may be other shapes such as a circular shape, or a square shape.<br><br>
In addition, the upper surface of the lamp cover 36 serves as a light-emitting surface 7A, so that a light beam of the bulb 33 irradiated via the upper surface 35A of the<br><br><br>
9<br><br>
lens 35 is irradiated upward. Therefore, the lamp 7 provides a good visibility from the rear. The joint portion between the lamp body 32 and the lamp cover 36, xvhich constitutes the upper surface of the lamp 7, is located below the upper edge of the rear cover RC of the side covers C, which will be described later, so as to be invisible from the outside, and the side surfaces continuing from the upper surface are inclined so as to face sideward as they approach to the front sides.<br><br>
In addition, as shown also in FIG. 11, the rear cover RC of the side covers C described above is disposed above the lamp 7. The rear cover RC is formed into a substantially rectangular shape projecting rearward at the center, like the lamp 7, so as to match the shape of the lamp 7 as shown in FIG. 4. The rear cover RC protects the lamp 7 with the rear edge thereof positioned forwardly of the lamp 7 so as to visualize the tail lamp 7a and the turn signals 7b of the lamp 7, and hence the quality in appearance is improved. And the grab rail G is positioned above the rear cover RC.<br><br>
Therefore, the grab rail G is mounted to the side surfaces of the side covers C located below the seat 5; the grab rail G is mounted so as to extend to the position above the lamp 7 having the light-emitting surface 7A on the upper surface and being located at the rearmost position of the vehicle body; and the grab rail G is formed following the shape of the lamp, so as to overlap at least a part of the lamp 7, more specifically, the portion around the boundary with respect to the rear cover RC in plan view.<br><br>
In addition, the grab rail G is mounted to the side covers C in a state in which a space D is provided with respect to the side covers C in plan view. Furthermore, the grab rail G is arranged such that the rear edge thereof is disposed in front of the rearmost end of the lamp 7 in plan view, so as to increase visibility of the lamp 7, and provide light feeling in appearance.<br><br>
Here, since the brackets 21 b and 22b are positioned at the inner lower portions<br><br><br>
10<br><br>
of the longitudinal midsections of the left and the right side portions 21 and 22, the grab rail G is mounted to the side covers C in a state in which a space D' is provided entire periphery of the seat S in plan view.<br><br>
In particular, since an inner rear edge 201 of the grab rail G is protruded rearwardly from a rear end SR of the seat 5, the space D' between the rear end SR of the seat S and the inner rear edge 201 is defined as a space K. Since the rear end SR of the seat S is protruded in the lateral direction, the space K is formed into a substantially triangular shape interposed between the rear end SR of the seat S and the inner rear edge 201 of the grab rail G.<br><br>
A constant gap is formed between the side covers C and the stoppers 21s and 22s, whereby it is not necessary to form a recessed portion additionally on the side covers C for gripping or mounting the grab rail G, and hence the appearance of the side covers C will not be impaired. And, the constant gap is set to a size that prevents the cloth of the occupant from being caught, and allows easy passage of a rope for fixing the load. In addition, it is also possible to form the stoppers 21s and 22s into a hook shape so that they can be used also as loading hooks.<br><br>
Next, the operation of the embodiment will be described below.<br><br>
The occupant can grip any portions of the grab rail G from the portion located beside the side covers C below the seat S to the rear as needed in a state of standing on the ground or of being seated on the rear portion S2 of the seat S. Therefore, the occupant can grip his/her desired portion easily and conveniently. In addition, the grab rail G, which is formed into a substantially U-shape in plan view, achieves improved shape and quality in appearance when viewed from above, and provides usability since the occupant can grip at any portion thereof without having sense of discomfort.<br><br>
In this case, the front halves of the left and the right side portions 21 and 22 of<br><br><br>
11<br><br>
the grab rail G are extended forwardly of the mounting portions 25 in a cantilevered manner, the space D opened upward and downward is formed with respect to the side covers C, and the space D' is formed entirely around the seat S. Therefore, it is easy to insert one's hand into the space formed with respect to the side covers C, and hence it is easy to grip and use. In addition, since it is easy to insert one's hand all around the seat 5, the occupant seated on the rear seat S2 can grip it easily. When it is used as a standing handle, since user can grip any portions as desired, it is convenient to use.<br><br>
In particular, since the inner rear edge 201 of the grab rail G protrudes rearward from the rear end SR of the seat 5, and since the space K is formed between the rear end SR of the seat S and the inner rear edge 201 in plan view, it is easy to insert one's hand from the space K, and hence it is easy to place the load thereon although the seat S is flat with respect to the grab rail G in terms of positional relationship. In other words, although the conventional grab rails can easily be gripped since the rear portion 20 extends upward and hence a space is defined in the vertical direction, loading capability is impaired correspondingly. In contrast, according to the present embodiment, the grab rail G is positioned substantially on the extension line L of the upper surface of the seat S in order to improve loading capability, that is, the seat S and the grab rail G are in flat relation in terms of position, and impairment of gripping capability which may occur correspondingly is solved by providing the space K and, in addition, a function to protect the lamp 7 is also provided and furthermore, improvement in the quality in appearance is achieved.<br><br>
In addition, since the portion for gripping can be widened by the front halves extending from the mounting portions 25 in a cantilevered manner, the occupant can conveniently use without being conscious of where to grip. Furthermore, since the portions around the front halves are opened over the entire periphery and no obstacle<br><br><br>
12<br><br>
exists there, the occupant can insert his/her hand into the space D easily, and can grip the<br><br>
front halves, that is, the grab rail G, when the situation calls for instant reaction, and at this time, the mounting portions 25 do not interrupt his/her gripping action.<br><br>
In addition, since the outer surface M of the grab rail G changes continuously toward the rear, and the upper surface H at the rearmost position is located almost on the extension line L of the upper surface of the seat 5, in terms of positional relation, continuity in appearance can be maintained and thus the quality in appearance can be improved.<br><br>
In addition, since the grab rail G functions as a member for protecting the lamp<br><br>
7, it prevents the lamp 7 from being gripped by mistake when the occupant grips the grab<br><br>
rail G, and thus the occupant can grip the grab rail G reliably and the grab rail G<br><br>
including the rear cover RC serves as a protective member for the lamp 7.<br><br>
In addition, even when a load N placed on the seat S is bulky and thus protrudes rearward from the seat S so as to cross over the grab rail G as shown in FIG. 1, since the upper surface H at the rear end of the grab rail G is located substantially on the extension line L of the seat S as described above, there is no difference in levels between the rearmost portion of the grab rail G and the upper surface of the seat 5, and hence the load N can be placed across both of them in a stable manner, and the load N will not interfere with the lamp 7, which improves the loading capability.<br><br>
In addition, the stoppers 21s and 22s can prevent movements of hands gripping the grab rail G in the direction of releasing the grab rail G, that is, in the longitudinal direction, and hence gripping thereof can be secured. Furthermore, since the gripping position cannot be forward of the predetermined position, bending moment exerted to the grab rail G falls within a predetermined range. Furthermore, they can also be used as loading hooks. Furthermore, since the inner end surfaces of the stoppers 21s and 22s<br><br><br>
13<br><br>
define a constant gap with respect to the outer surfaces of the side covers C, the cloth or the like of the occupant can hardly be caught between the stoppers 21s and 22s and the side covers C, but the rope for fixing the load placed on the grab rail can be passed easily.<br><br>
In addition, the grab rail G is mounted to the rear frame Fr behind the fuel tank T. Since the grab rail G is mounted in this manner, the width of the motorcycle by itself will not increase more than necessary and, as shown in FIG. 3, the outer surface of the grab rail G will not project outward from the outer surface at the widest portion of the side covers C as those in the conventional ones. Therefore, quality in appearance can be improved and the grab rail G will not interfere with other things located beside the vehicle body.<br><br>
Moreover, the present invention is not limited to the above-mentioned embodiment, and may be applied to the vehicles of different type, such as a vehicle having a main pipe extending substantially horizontally from the head pipe toward the rear.<br><br><br><br>
INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY<br><br>
The present invention provides a grab rail for a motor cycle. According to the grab rail for a motor cycle of the present invention, since an occupant can grip any portions of the grab rail from the portion located beside the side covers below the seat to the rear, the occupant can grip his/her desired portion easily and conveniently. In addition, since the grab rail of the present invention functions as a member for protecting the lamp, it prevents the lamp from being gripped by mistake, and hence the lamp can be a protection member. Furthermore, in the grab rail of the present invention, the outer surface thereof changes continuously toward the rear and, in terms of the positional relationship with the seat, is located substantially on the extension line of the upper<br><br><br>

surface of the seat at the rearmost portion so that the grab rail protrudes from the seat surface at the same level in appearance. Therefore, continuity in appearance can be maintained and the quality in appearance can be improved. In addition, although the grab rail is positioned substantially on the extension line of the upper surface of the seat and thus the positional relation between the seat and the grab rail is flat, since there is a space defined between the seat and the grab rail and, more specifically, between the rear end of the seat and the inner rear edge of the grab rail, it is easy to insert one's hand, and in addition, since the seat and the grab rail are in flat relation in tenns of position, it is easy to place a load thereon. Furthermore, in the grab rail of the present invention, even when the load placed on the seat is bulky and thus protrudes rearward from the seat so as to cross over the grab rail, since there is no difference in levels between the upper surface of the rearmost portion of the grab rail and the upper surface of the seat, the load can be placed across both of them in stable manner, and the load will not interfere with the lamp.<br></td>
