				<td>Description<br>
Fuel pump and fuel feed system for an internal combustion<br>
engine of a motor vehicle having a fuel pump<br>
as disclosed in document DE 101 38838<br>
The invention relates to a fuel pump as disclosed in document DE 101 38838 having a driven impeller<br>
facing a casing part, with rings of guide vanes arranged in the<br>
impeller concentrically enclosing one another and defining<br>
blade chambers, with partially annular fuel feed ducts facing<br>
the rings of guide vanes in the casing part, and with outlet<br>
ducts connected to the partially annular ducts, the rings of<br>
the blade chambers and the partially annular ducts forming a<br>
radially inner delivery chamber and a radially outer delivery<br>
chamber. The invention further relates to a fuel feed system<br>
for an internal combustion engine of a motor vehicle having<br>
such a fuel pump for drawing fuel from a fuel tank and<br>
delivering the fuel to the internal combustion engine.<br>
Such fuel pumps are commonly used in fuel feed systems of<br>
modern motor vehicles and are known in practice. Here the<br>
delivery chambers of the fuel pump serve for filling a swirl<br>
pot and for supplying the internal combustion engine of the<br>
motor vehicle with fuel. The impeller is generally fixed on a<br>
shaft of an electric motor and in normal operation is driven at<br>
a rated speed. Particularly when starting the internal<br>
combustion engine at low temperatures, however, the rated speed<br>
frequently is not reliably achieved, since the electric motor<br>
is driven at a low voltage and therefore has only a low power<br>
output. This leads, especially in the radially inner delivery<br>
chamber, to a greatly reduced delivery capacity of the fuel<br>
pump. In the worst case<br><br>
this means that the swirl pot is no longer filled and the<br>
delivery of fuel to the internal combustion engine is<br>
interrupted.<br>
A further disadvantage of the known fuel feed system is that<br>
the impeller in normal operation has to be constantly driven at<br>
the rated speed regardless of the fuel demand of the internal<br>
combustion engine, in order that the delivery capacity of the<br>
radially inner delivery chamber does not fall. This means that<br>
the fuel pump has an unnecessarily high energy demand in order<br>
to drive the impeller.<br>
The object of the invention is to design a fuel pump of the<br>
aforementioned type so that it ensures a sufficiently high<br>
delivery capacity of the inner delivery chamber even at a low<br>
impeller speed below the rated speed. It is furthermore<br>
intended to create a fuel feed system having such a fuel pump<br>
which ensures a reliable fuel feed at different impeller<br>
speeds.<br>
According to the invention the first aforementioned object is<br>
achieved in that the radially outer delivery chamber is<br>
connected to the radially inner delivery chamber via a<br>
connecting duct.<br>
This design enables fuel to flow from the radially outer<br>
delivery chamber over to the radially inner delivery chamber<br>
when the pressure falls inside the radially inner delivery<br>
chamber. Since at low impeller speed the delivery capacity in<br>
the radially outer delivery chamber falls considerably less<br>
than in the radially inner delivery chamber, this ensures a<br>
reliable delivery of fuel in both delivery chambers. The fuel<br>
pump according to the invention can therefore also be operated<br>
at a speed below the rated speed<br><br>
in the event of a correspondingly low fuel demand of the<br>
internal combustion engine without the risk of interrupting the<br>
delivery of fuel.<br>
The fuel pump according to the invention is of particularly<br>
simple design if the connecting duct is arranged in the casing<br>
part and connects the partially annular ducts.<br>
The fuel pump according to the invention is particularly<br>
inexpensive to produce if the connecting duct takes the form of<br>
a groove arranged in the casing part. Since the casing part of<br>
the fuel pump is generally produced by a sintering process or<br>
injection molding process anyway, the connecting duct can be<br>
produced by a very simple structural modification of the mold<br>
shape for the casing part.<br>
In the event of a pressure gradient between the radially outer<br>
delivery chamber and the radially inner delivery chamber a fuel<br>
supply to the radially inner delivery chamber can be reliably<br>
ensured if the connecting duct points away from the radially<br>
outer delivery chamber towards the radially inner delivery<br>
chamber viewed in the direction of rotation of the impeller.<br>
Since the pressure in the radially outer delivery chamber is<br>
generally greater than in the radially inner delivery chamber<br>
and moreover increases over the length thereof, a suitable<br>
choice of the connection of the connecting duct to the radially<br>
outer delivery chamber is a simple way of ensuring what minimum<br>
pressure is set in the radially inner delivery chamber.<br>
According to another advantageous development of the invention,<br>
the connecting duct can easily be prevented from exerting any<br>
influence on the flows in the delivery chambers at rated speed<br>
if the connections of the connecting duct to the radially inner<br>
and the radially outer delivery chambers are laid so that at a<br>
rated speed of the impeller the same pressure prevails on both<br>
connections. Since at low impeller<br><br>
speed the pressure in the radially inner delivery chamber falls<br>
particularly sharply, this design serves by means of the<br>
connecting duct to raise the pressure in the radially inner<br>
delivery chamber solely when operating below the rated speed.<br>
According to another advantageous development of the invention<br>
the connection of the connecting duct to the outer delivery<br>
chamber is particularly inexpensive if an initial section of<br>
the connecting duct connected to the radially outer, partially<br>
annular duct is inclined by a designated angle a to the<br>
straight line taken through the axis of rotation of the<br>
impeller.<br>
According to another advantageous development of the invention<br>
the connection of the connecting duct to the inner delivery<br>
chamber is particularly inexpensive if a terminal section of<br>
the connecting duct opening into the radially inner, partially<br>
annular duct is inclined by a designated angle β to the<br>
straight line taken through the axis of rotation of the<br>
impeller.<br>
According to another advantageous development of the invention,<br>
swirling in the delivery chambers as the fuel flows over can be<br>
particularly minimized if the angle a and/or the angle β is/are<br>
approximately 45°.<br>
According to another advantageous development of the invention,<br>
the length of the connecting duct can be freely selected,<br>
making the minimum pressure in the inner delivery chamber easy<br>
to adjust, if the connecting duct has a middle section arranged<br>
concentrically between the partially annular ducts.<br>
According to another advantageous development of the invention,<br>
any influence exerted on the flow in the connecting duct by<br>
friction on the impeller can be particularly<br><br>
minimized if the impeller has a smooth surface in its area<br>
facing the connecting duct.<br>
According to another advantageous development of the invention,<br>
it is of assistance in further reducing the influence exerted<br>
on the flow by friction on the impeller if the connecting duct<br>
in the form of a groove is deeper than it is wide. This design<br>
is particularly effective in minimizing the contact surface of<br>
the impeller with the medium present in the connecting duct.<br>
According to the invention the second aforementioned object,<br>
that is to say the creation of a fuel feed system having such a<br>
fuel pump and in which a reliable delivery of fuel is ensured<br>
at different speeds of the impeller, is achieved in that the<br>
radially outer delivery chamber is connected to the internal<br>
combustion engine and the radially inner delivery chamber is<br>
connected to a jet pump arranged inside the fuel tank.<br>
This arrangement allows the fuel pump to be designed<br>
exclusively for the fuel demand of the internal combustion<br>
engine, the connecting duct of the fuel pump ensuring that the<br>
radially inner delivery chamber receives sufficient fuel.<br>
Compared to a fuel feed system in which the jet pump is<br>
supplied with fuel via a branch from the line led to the<br>
internal combustion engine, the fuel feed system according to<br>
the invention, in which the delivery chambers of the fuel pump<br>
are connected by way of a connecting duct, is of particularly<br>
cost-effective design. The invention means that the fuel feed<br>
system according to the invention has two stages connected by<br>
the connecting duct, one of which delivers fuel exclusively to<br>
the internal combustion engine and<br><br>
the other only feeds fuel inside the fuel tank.<br>
A control device for regulating the power output of an electric<br>
motor driving the impeller as a function of the fuel demand of<br>
the internal combustion engine means that the fuel feed system<br>
according to the invention has an especially low energy demand.<br>
The invention permits numerous embodiments. In order to<br>
further illustrate its basic principle one of these embodiments<br>
is represented in the drawing and is described below. In the accompanying<br>
drawing:<br>
Fig. 1 shows a schematic representation of a fuel feed system<br>
having a fuel pump according to the invention,<br>
Fig. 2 shows a section through the fuel pump in Figure 1 along<br>
the line II-II.<br>
Figure 1 shows a schematic representation of a fuel feed system<br>
1 for an internal combustion engine 2 of a motor vehicle having<br>
a feed unit 4 arranged in a fuel tank 3. The feed unit 4 has a<br>
fuel pump 6, arranged in a swirl pot 5, having a pump stage 8<br>
driven by an electric motor 7. The electric motor 7 is supplied<br>
with electrical current via a control device 9. Fuel delivered<br>
by the fuel pump 6 passes via a flow line 10 to the internal<br>
combustion engine 2. The flow line 10 and electrical leads 11<br>
of the electric motor 7 are led through a flange 12 introduced<br>
into the fuel tank 3.<br>
The pump stage 8 takes the form of a side-channel pump and has<br>
an impeller 15, rotatably arranged between two casing parts 13,<br>
14, and two delivery chambers 16, 17.<br><br>
The impeller 15 is rotationally locked on a shaft 18 of the<br>
electric motor 7 and has two rings of guide vanes 19, 20<br>
concentrically enclosing one another and defining blade<br>
chambers. The blade chambers together with partially annular<br>
ducts 21, 22 arranged opposite in the casing parts 13, 14 form<br>
the delivery chambers 16, 17. The radially inner delivery<br>
chamber 16 delivers fuel from the swirl pot 5 to a jet pump 23,<br>
whilst the radially outer delivery chamber 17 delivers fuel<br>
from the swirl pot 5 through the electric motor 7 into the flow<br>
line 10. The jet pump 23 draws fuel from the fuel tank 3 via a<br>
prefilter 24 and delivers this into the swirl pot 5. The<br>
delivery chambers 16, 17 each pass through the impeller 15 and<br>
therefore have partially annular ducts 21, 22 arranged in each<br>
of the casing parts 13, 14. In Fig. 1, for the purpose of<br>
illustration, inlets 25, 26 and outlets 27, 28 of the delivery<br>
chambers 16, 17 in the casing parts 13, 14 are shown turned<br>
into the plane of the drawing. In actual fact the partially<br>
annular ducts 21, 22 extend over an angular range of up to<br>
340° .<br>
Fig. 2 shows one of the casing parts 14 of the pump stage 8 of<br>
the fuel pump 6 in Figure 1. This clearly shows the partially<br>
annular ducts 21, 22 concentrically enclosing one another,<br>
which are arranged facing the rings of the guide vanes 19, 2 0<br>
of the impeller 15 represented in Figure 1. The direction of<br>
rotation of the impeller 15 is identified by an arrow. Fig. 2<br>
furthermore shows that the partially annular ducts 21, 22 are<br>
connected to one another via a connecting duct 29. The<br>
connecting duct 29 takes the form of a groove which is arranged<br>
in the casing part 14 and is deeper than it is wide. The<br>
connecting duct 29 has an initial section 3 0 connected to the<br>
outer partially annular duct 22, and a terminal section 31<br>
opening into the inner partially annular duct 21. The initial<br>
section 30 and the terminal section 31 are connected to one<br>
another by a middle section 3 2 arranged parallel to the<br><br>
partially annular ducts 21, 22. The initial section 30 is<br>
inclined by the angle α and the terminal section 31 is inclined<br>
by the angle β to the straight line taken through the axis of<br>
rotation of the impeller 15. The angles α and (3 are in each<br>
case 45°, for example.<br>
The connecting duct 29 is connected to the partially annular<br>
ducts 21, 22 in such a way that at a rated speed of the<br>
impeller 15 the same pressure prevails at connections 33, 34 of<br>
the connecting duct 29 to the partially annular ducts 21, 22.<br>
A pressure equilibrium, which prevents any flow of fuel,<br>
thereby prevails in the connecting duct 29. If the speed of<br>
the impeller 15 falls below the rated speed, however, the feed<br>
pressures in the delivery chambers 16, 17 and hence in the<br>
partially annular ducts 21, 22 will also fall. In the radially<br>
inner, partially annular duct 21, however, the fall in pressure<br>
is much more pronounced than in the radially outer, partially<br>
annular duct 22. Such a fall in pressure would mean, however,<br>
that the jet pump 23 would no longer be reliably supplied with<br>
fuel as propellant. The connecting duct 29 remedies this by<br>
diverting fuel from the radially outer delivery chamber 17 in<br>
the event of a fall in pressure in the radially inner delivery<br>
chamber 16, thereby maintaining the intended pressure in the<br>
radially inner delivery chamber 16. The fuel feed system 1<br>
thereby allows the power output of the electric motor 7 to be<br>
controlled by the control device 9 according to the fuel<br>
consumption of the internal combustion engine 2.<br><br>
