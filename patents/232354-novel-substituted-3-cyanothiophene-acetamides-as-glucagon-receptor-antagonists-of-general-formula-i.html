				<td>The present invention is concerned with Novel substituted 3-cyanothiophene acetamides as glucagon receptor antagonists, their manufacture and their use as medicaments. The present invention further relates to pharmaceutically acceptable salts of these 3-cyanothiophene compounds and pharmaceutical compositions containing these compounds.<br>
The glucagon receptor (GLUR) is a G-protein coupled 7-transmembrane domain receptor (GPCR) of the secretin family. When the natural hormonal ligand glucagon binds to the GLUR, there is an activation of adenylate cyclase and a concomitant increase in cAMP production. This increase in cAMP causes an activation of glycogen phosphorylase resulting in an increase in hepatic glucose production. The actions of glucagon are counter-regulatory to insulin and thus it is believed to play a central role in glucose homeostasis. Glucagon has been used clinically to rescue diabetic patients from hypoglycemia. Thus, a small molecule GLUR antagonists has considerable potential for the treatment of diabetes.<br>
Briefly stated, novel substituted 3-cyanothiophene acetamides have been found to be glucagon receptor antagonists that inhibit glucagon stimulated increase in cAMP production in a functional cell based assay. Consequently, the compounds of the present invention are useful for the treatment and/or prophylaxis of diabetes, and/or impaired glucose tolerance, as well as other conditions wherein the antagonism of the glucagon receptor gives a therapeutic benefit.<br>

The invention further relates to the use of compounds as defined above for the treatment and/or prophylaxis of diseases which are associated with the glucagons receptor, preferably for the treatment and/or prophylaxis of diabetes.<br><br>
In addition, the invention relates to the use of compounds as defined above for the preparation of medicaments for the treatment and/or prophylaxis of diseases which are associated with the glucagons receptor, preferably for the treatment and/or prophylaxis of diabetes. Such medicaments comprise a compound as defined above. The compounds of formula (I) can be manufactured by the methods given below, by the methods given in the examples or by analogous methods. Appropriate reaction conditions for the individual reaction steps are known to the person skilled in the art. Starting materials are either commercially available or can be prepared by methods analogous to the methods given below or in the examples or by methods known in the art.<br>
The following tests were carried out in order to determine the activity of the compounds of formula I.<br>
In general, glucagon antagonists may be identified by their ability to inhibit or reduce stimulation of cAMP production, relative to the cAMP production in the presence of native glucagon alone, as determined in an adenylate cyclase assay. Adenylate cyclase assays are described, for example, by Lin et al. (Biochemistry 14:1559-1563, 1975; which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety). Biological responses via the inositol triphosphate pathway may be assessed by measuring inositol phosphate metabolism as generally described in Subers and Nathanson (J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 20:131-140, 1988; which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety) or Pittner and Fain (ibid.; which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety) or by measuring the intracellular calcium concentration as generally described by Grynkiewicz et al. (J. Biol. Chem. 260:3440-3450, 1985; which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety).<br>
In a preferred embodiment, glucagon antagonists, including the 3-cyanothiophene acetamides of the present invention, may be identified through their ability to specifically inhibit the glucagon-induced adenylate cyclase response pathway. Glucagon receptors have been reported in a number of tissues, for example, liver, kidney, cardiac muscle and adipose tissue from a number of species including dog, pig, human and rat. In addition, host cells expressing recombinant glucagon receptors may also be used. Adenylate cyclase activity assays may be carried out using, for example, the method described by<br><br>
Lin et al. (Biochemistry. 14:1559-1563, 1975). These methods measure the level of stimulation of cAMP production relative to native glucagon and generally involve exposing a membrane preparation from tissue containing glucagon receptors to a mixture of glucagon and the glucagon antagonist in the presence of ATP. Membrane preparations from rat liver are generally used for adenylate cyclase activity assays, although other tissues containing glucagon receptors or host cells expressing a recombinant glucagon receptor may be used. Membranes may be prepared using the method described by Neville (Biochim. Biophys Acta 154:540-552, 1968) as modified by Pohl (Methods in Receptor Research, Ed. Blecher, M., New York, pp 160-164, 1976).<br>
cAMP measurement in CHO/GluR12B cells<br>
The glucagon antagonists described herein have been characterized using CHO-K1 cells overexpressing the full length human glucagon receptor (CHO/GluR 12B). Cells were plated in a 384well plate at a density of 10000 cells/well in medium containing DMEM (Gibco #21063-029), 10% dialyzed FBS (Gibco#26400-044), 1% L-Glutamine (Gibco # 25030-081) and 1% Pen/Strep (Gibco # 15140-122). The cells were allowed to adhere overnight at 37°C. The media was removed and the cells were then pre-incubated with antagonist solubilized in DMSO diluted in DMEM containing 0.5mM IBMX (Calbiochem #410957), lmg/ml BSA (Sigma #A-8806), 25mM HEPES for lhr. Glucagon (O.lnM) diluted in the same medium is then added for 30 min at 37°C. The formation of cAMP is measured in the cell lysates using a protocol and reagents purchased from Applied Biosystems for their cAMP-Screen™ System. An IC50 of a glucagon receptor antagonist is calculated by plotting the dose response of antagonist versus the percent of maximum cAMP generated by O.lnM glucagon using Microsoft XLFit equation #205 (Sigmoidal Dose Response w/ variable slope). Provided the appropriate concentrations of antagonist are used to obtain saturation at both the high and low concentrations, the midpoint of the curve is extrapolated as the IC50. The IC50 values for the inhibition of glucagon stimulated cAMP production as measured in the above described cell based assay for each of the compounds described in the examples below are

The compounds of formula I and/or their pharmaceutically acceptable salts can be used as medicaments, e.g. in the form of pharmaceutical preparations for enteral, parenteral or topical administration. They can be administered, for example, perorally, e.g. in the form of tablets, coated tablets, dragees, hard and soft gelatine capsules, solutions, emulsions or suspensions, rectally, e.g. in the form of suppositories, parenterally, e.g. in the form of injection solutions or infusion solutions, or topically, e.g. in the form of ointments, creams or oils. Oral administration is preferred.<br>
The production of the pharmaceutical preparations can be effected in a manner which will be familiar to any person skilled in the art by bringing the described compounds of formula I and/or their pharmaceutically acceptable salts, optionally in combination with other therapeutically valuable substances, into a galenical administration form together with suitable, non-toxic, inert, therapeutically compatible solid or liquid carrier materials and, if desired, usual pharmaceutical adjuvants.<br>
Suitable carrier materials are not only inorganic carrier materials, but also organic carrier materials. Thus, for example, lactose, corn starch or derivatives thereof, talc, stearic acid or its salts can be used as carrier materials for tablets, coated tablets, dragees and hard gelatine capsules. Suitable carrier materials for soft gelatine capsules are, for example, vegetable oils, waxes, fats and semi-solid and liquid polyols (depending on the nature of the active ingredient no carriers might, however, be required in the case of soft gelatine capsules). Suitable carrier materials for the production of solutions and syrups are, for example, water, polyols, sucrose, invert sugar and the like. Suitable carrier materials for<br><br>
injection solutions are, for example, water, alcohols, polyols, glycerol and vegetable oils.<br>
Suitable carrier materials for suppositories are, for example, natural or hardened oils,<br>
waxes, fats and semi-liquid or liquid polyols. Suitable carrier materials for topical<br>
preparations are glycerides, semi-synthetic and synthetic glycerides, hydrogenated oils,<br>
liquid waxes, liquid paraffins, liquid fatty alcohols, sterols, polyethylene glycols and<br>
cellulose derivatives.<br>
Usual stabilizers, preservatives, wetting and emulsifying agents, consistency-improving<br>
agents, flavor-improving agents, salts for varying the osmotic pressure, buffer substances,<br>
solubilizers, colorants and masking agents and antioxidants come into consideration as<br>
pharmaceutical adjuvants.<br>
The dosage of the compounds of formula I can vary within wide limits depending on the<br>
disease to be controlled, the age and the individual condition of the patient and the mode<br>
of administration, and will, of course, be fitted to the individual requirements in each<br>
particular case. For adult patients a daily dosage of about 1 to 1000 mg, especially about<br>
1 to 100 mg, comes into consideration. Depending on severity of the disease and the<br>
precise pharmacokinetic profile the compound could be administered with one or several<br>
daily dosage units, e.g. in 1 to 3 dosage units.<br>
The pharmaceutical preparations conveniently contain about 1-500 mg, preferably 1-<br>
100 mg, of a compound of formula I.<br>
The following Examples serve to illustrate the present invention in more detail. They are,<br>
however, not intended to limit its scope in any manner.<br>
General Methods<br>
The compounds of formula (I) can be manufactured by the methods given below, by the methods outlined in the examples or by analogous methods.<br>
Scheme 1, below, generally describes the synthesis of compounds of formula (I). Thiophene (b) may be formed by contacting ketone (a) with malononitrile and sulfur in an alcoholic solvent in the presence of a secondary amine. The compound of formula (I) may then be formed by contacting acetyl chloride (c) with thiophene (b).<br><br>
