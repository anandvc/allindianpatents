				<td>SYNTHESIS OF STERICALLY HINDERED    SECONDARY AMINOETHER ALCOHOLS<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0001]     The present invention relates to a method for the preparation of severely sterically hindered secondary aminoether alcohols which are useful in the removal of hydrogen sulfide from gaseous streams containing hydrogen sulfide and which may also contain carbon dioxide.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART<br>
[0002]     It is well-known in the art to treat gases and liquids, such as mixtures containing acidic gases including CO2, H2S, CS2, HCN, COS and oxygen and sulfur derivatives of C1 to C4 hydrocarbons with amine solutions to remove<br>
these acidic gases. The amine usually contacts the acidic gases and the liquids as an aqueous solution containing the amine in an absorber tower with the aqueous amine solution contacting the acidic fluid countercurrently. Usually this contacting results in the simultaneous removal of substantial amounts of both the CO2 and H2S. USP 4,112,052, for example, utilizes a sterically<br>
hindered amine to obtain nearly complete removal of CO2 and H2S acid gases. This process is particularly suitable for systems in which the partial pressures of the CO2 and related gases are low. For systems where the partial pressure of CO2 is high or where there are many acid gases present, e.g., H2S, COS, CH3SH, CS2, etc., a process utilizing an amine in combination with a physical<br>
absorbent, referred to as a "non-aqueous solvent process" is practiced. Such a system is described in USP 4,112,051.<br>
[0003]     Selective removal of H2S from acid gas systems containing both H2S and CO2, however, is very desirable. Such selective removal results in arelatively high H2S/CO2 ratio in the separated acid gas which facilitates the subsequent conversion of the H2S to elemental sulfur in the Glaus process.<br>
[0004]     The typical reactions of aqueous secondary and tertiary amines with CO2 and H2S can be represented as follows<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
Where R is the same or different organic radical and may be substituted with a hydroxyl group. Because the reactions are reversible they are sensitive to the CO2 and H2S partial pressures which is determinative of the degree to which the<br>
reactions occur.<br>
[0005]     Selective H2S removal is particularly desirable in systems having low H2S/CO2 ratios and relatively low H2S partial pressures as compared to that of the CO2. The ability of amine to selectivity remove H2S in such systems is very low.<br>
[0006]     Solutions of primary and secondary amines such as monoethanol-amine (MEA), diethanolamine (DEA), diisopropanolamine (DPA), and hydroxyethoxyethylamine (DEA) absorb both H2S and CO2, and thus have<br>
proven unsatisfactory for the selective removal of H2S to the exclusion of CO2-The CO2 forms carbamates with such amines relatively easily.<br>
[0007]     H2S has been selectively removed from gases containing H2S and CO2 by use of diisopropanolamine (DIPA) either alone or mixed with a non-aqueous physical solvent such as sulfolane. Contact times, however, must be kept short to take advantage of the faster reaction of H2S with the amine as<br>
compared to the rate of CO2 reaction with the amine.<br>
[0008]     Frazier and Kohl, Ind. and Eng. Chem., 42,2288 (1950) showed that the tertiary amine methydiethanolamine (MDEA) is more selective toward H2S<br>
absorption as compared to CO2- CO2 reacts relatively slowly with tertiary amines as compared to the rapid reaction of the tertiary amine with H2S. However, it has the disadvantage of having a relatively low H2S loading capacity and limited ability to reduce the H2S content to the desired level at low H2S pressures encountered in certain gases.<br>
[0009]     UK Patent Publication No. 2,017,524A discloses the use of aqueous solutions of dialkylmonoalkanolamines, e.g., diethylmonoethanol amine (DEAE), for the selective removal of H2S, such material having higher<br>
selectivity and capacity for H2S removal at higher loading levels than MDEA.<br>
DEAE, however, has the disadvantage of a low boiling point of 161 °C, making il relatively highly volatile resulting in large material loss.<br>
[0010]     USP 4,471,138 the entire teaching of which is incorporated herein by reference, teaches severely sterically hindered acyclic secondary aminoether alcohols having a high selectivity for H2S compared to CO2- Selectivity is<br>
maintained at high H2S and CO2 loadings.<br>
[0011]     The severely sterically hindered acyclic amine ether alcohols of USP 4,471,138 are represented by the general formula:<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
wherein RI and R2 are each independently selected from the group consisting of alkyl and hydroxyalkyl radicals having 1-4 carbon atoms, R3, R4, R5 and R6 are<br>
each independently selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, alkyl, and hydroxyalkyl radicals having 1-4 carbon atoms, with the proviso that at least one of R4 or R5 bonded to the carbon atom which is directly bonded to the nitrogen<br>
atom is an alkyl or hydroxyalkyl radical when R3 is hydrogen, x and y are each<br>
positive integers ranging from 2-4, and z is a positive integer ranging from 1-4. These materials are prepared by a high temperature reaction preferably in the presence of a solvent, of a secondary or tertiary alkyl primary amine with an ether alcohol containing a carbonyl functionality in the presence of a source of hydrogen or with a haloalkoxyalkanol. Preferably the composition is of the general formula:<br>
(Figure Removed)<br><br><br>
where R2, R3, R4 and R5 are each independently selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, C1-C4 alkyl radicals, and C3-Cg cycloalkyl radicals, with the proviso that if the carbon atom of RI directly attached to the nitrogen atom is secondary, at least one of R2 and R3 directly bonded to the carbon which<br>
is bonded to the hydroxyl group is as alkyl or cycloalkyl radical, x and y are each positive integers independently ranging from 2 to 4 and z is from 1 to 10, preferably 1 to 6, more preferably 1 to 4. The process is carried out in the presence of a catalytically effective amount of a supported Group VIII metal containing hydrogenation catalyst at elevated temperatures and pressure and the mole ratio of ammo compound to polyalkenyl ether glycol is less than 2:1 when z is greater than 1.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0013]     A new process has been discovered for the production of severely sterically hindered secondary aminoether alcohols of the general formula 1:<br><br><br>
wherein R1 and R2 are each independently selected from the group consisting of alkyl and hydroxyalkyl radicals having 1 to 4 carbon atoms, preferably 1 to 2 carbon atoms, or R1 and R2 in combination with the carbon atom to which they are attached form a cycloalkyl group having 3 to 8 carbons; R3 is selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, alkyl or hydroxyalkyl radicals having 1 to 4 carbon atoms, and mixtures thereof, preferably 1 to 2 carbon atoms, preferably alkyl or hydroxyalkyl radicals having 1 to 4 carbon atoms, more preferably 1 to<br>
2 carbon atoms; R4, R5, R6, R7, R8, R9, R10, and R11 are the same or different and are selected from hydrogen, alkyl or hydroxyalkyl radicals having 1 to 4 carbon atoms, preferably 1 to 2 carbon atoms, or cycloalkyl radicals having 3 to 8 carbons; R4, R5, R6, R7, R8, R9, RlO, and R 11 are preferably hydrogen provided that when R3 is hydrogen at least one of R4 and R5 directly bonded to the carbon which is bonded to the nitrogen atom is an alkyl or hydroxyalkyl radical. The process involves reacting an organic carboxylic acid halide, an organic carboxylic acid anhydride, a ketene or a mixture of any two or of all three thereof of the formula: (Figure Removed)<br>
wherein R12 and R13 are the same or different and each is selected from the group consisting of alkyl radicals having 1 to 4 carbon atoms, preferably 1 to 2 carbon atoms, most preferably methyl, or aryl radicals, preferably phenyl substituted with hydrogen, one or more alkyl radicals having 1-10 carbon atoms,<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
preferably 1-4 carbon atoms, most preferably methyl hi the para position, and mixtures thereof, and X is a halogen selected from F, Cl, Br, I, and mixtures thereof, preferably Cl, and Rx and Ry are the same or different and are selected from the group consisting of hydrogen or alkyl radicals having 1 to 4 carbons, preferably 1 to 2 carbons, aryl radicals, preferably aryl radicals bearing substituents selected from the group consisting of hydrogen and one or more alkyl radicals having 1 to 10 carbons, preferably 1 to 4 carbons, and mixtures thereof, or Rx and Ry in combination with the carbon to which they are attached from a cycloalkyl radical having 3 to 8 carbons, preferably Rx and Ry are hydrogen or phenyl with an organic sulfonic acid of the formula:<br>
wherein Q is an integer selected from 1 to 4, preferably 1-3, more preferably 1-2,<br>
most preferably 1, R14 is selected from the group consisting of alkyl radicals having 1 to 4 carbon atoms, preferably 1 to 2 carbon atoms, most preferably methyl, haloalkyl radicals of the formula CnH(2n+l)-zxz wherein n is 1 to 4 preferably 1 to 2, and most preferably 1; X is selected from the group consisting of F, Cl, Br, I, and mixtures thereof, preferably F and Cl, most preferably F; and z ranges from 1 to 5, preferably 1 to 3, most preferably 3, aryl radical 3<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
wherein R15, R.16 Rl7t Rl8f and Rl9 are same or different and are selected from hydrogen and alkyl radicals having 1 to 20 carbon atoms, preferably R15, Rl6} Rl8j and R19 are hydrogen and Rl7 is selected from hydrogen and alkyl radicals having 1-4 carbons, preferably 1 to 2 carbons, more preferably methyl,and mixtures thereof, to yield sulfonic-carboxylic anhydride compounds of the <br><br>
wherein R12/13 means that in the product the R group can be R12 or R13 or a mixture thereof which is then reacted with a dioxane of the formula 5:<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
wherein R4, R5, R6, R7, R8, R9, R10, and R11 are the same or different and are selected from hydrogen, alkyl and hydroxyalkyl radicals having 1 to 4 carbons, preferably 1 to 2 carbons or cycloalkyl radicals having 3 to 8 carbons, more<br>
preferably R4, R5, R6, R7, R8, R9, R10, and R11 are hydrogen, to yield material of the general formula 6, <br><br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
be isolated before being reacted with the reactant of a subsequent step up to this point. A cleavage product is still produced. The mixing of the organic carboxylic acid halide, organic carboxylic acid anhydride, ketene or mixture of any two or of all three thereof with the organic sulfonic acid and the dioxane can be in any order or sequence. Thus, the anhydride, acid halide, ketene or mixture of any two or all three can be mixed with the organic sulfonic acid and then mixed with the dioxane, or the dioxane can be first mixed with the organic sulfonic acid and then with the anhydride, acid halide, ketene or mixture of any two or all three thereof, or the anhydride, acid halide, ketene or mixture of any two or of all three thereof, can be mixed with the dioxane followed by the addition of the organic sulfonic acid. Thus the combination of the anhydride, acid halide, ketene or mixture of any two or of all three thereof with the dioxane and the organic sulfonic acid can be combined into a single reaction mixture and reacted as a mixture resulting in the one step production of the desired cleavage product. The cleavage product is then reacted with an alkylamine of the formula<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
wherein Rx and Ry are the same or different and are hydrogen or alkyl radicals having from 1 to 4 carbons, preferably 1 to 2 carbons, most preferably hydrogen or aryl radicals, preferably aryl radicals substituted with hydrogen or one or more alkyl radicals having 1 to 10 carbons, preferably 1 to 4 carbons, or RX and Ry in combination with the carbon to which they are attached from a cycloalkyl radical having 3 to 8 carbons, preferably RX and Ry are .hydrogen or phenyl the preferred ketenes being<br>
(Figure Removed) [0015]     The ketenes useful in the present invention can be prepared employing any of the processes typical in the art. Thus, for example, acetic acid can be subjected to high temperature dehydration in the presence of AlPC4, or acetone can be subjected to pyrolysis at from 500 to 750°C to yield ketene and methane.<br>
[0016]     These materials are then reacted with a second component, typically<br><br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
	?	<br>
[0017]     The reaction of two such components yields acyl sulfonates 4a and/or 4b and/or 4c. The reaction can be carried out at a temperature in the range of about -20°C to 150°C, preferably about 0°C to 140°C, more preferably about 20°C to 125°C and at a pressure between about 1 bar to 100 bars, preferably about 1 bar to 50 bars, more preferably about 1 bar to 10 bars. The reaction can be carried out in the absence of any solvent or an inert solvent such as sulfolane, hexanes, acetonitrile can be used. Preferably, the dioxane for the subsequent cleavage reaction is used as the solvent resulting in a unified first step wherein the reaction mixture contains the acid anhydride, acid halide, ketene or mixture of any two or of all three thereof, the organic sulfonic acid and the dioxane. This reaction mixture is then reacted under the conditions subsequently described for the dioxane cleavage reaction.<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
[0020]     Reaction is for a time sufficient to cleave the dioxane ring and to achieve about 60-90% conversion to product. The dioxane also serves as the solvent for the reaction. The molar ratio of dioxane to sulfonate can range from about 1:1 to about 10:1, preferably about 1:1 to about 8:1, most preferably about 1:1 to about 5:1. The reaction can be carried out in the absence of any added solvent, e.g., the dioxane serving as the solvent, or an additional solvent such as acetonitrile or toluene can be used, the reaction being conducted at temperatures between about 50°C to about 200°C, preferably about 70°C to about 160°C, more preferably about 80°C to about 140°C.<br>
[0021]     Preferably, the reaction is carried out in the absence of any added solvent at a temperature in the range of about 50°C to about 160°C, preferably about 70°C to about 160°C, more preferably about 80°C to about 140°C.<br>
[0022]     The production of sulfonic-carboxylic anhydrides by the reaction of organic carboxylic acid halides or anhydrides with an organic sulfonic acid, and the cleaving of dioxone by such sulfonic-carboxylic anhydrides are described hi greater detail by Karger and Mazur in "The Cleavage of Ethers by Mixed Sulfonic-Carboxylic Anhydrides", Journal of the American Chemical Society, 1968,90, 3878-3879. See also "Mixed sulfonic-carboxylic anhydrides. I. Synthesis and thermal stability. New syntheses of sulfonic anhydrides" Journal of Organic Chemistry, 1971, 36,528, and "Mixed sulfonic-carboxylic anhydrides. II. Reactions with aliphatic ethers and amines" Journal of Organic Chemistry, 1971, 36,532.<br>
[0023]     The cleavage product 6 is then animated with an amine 7 typically of the formula: (Figure Removed)for a time sufficient to replace the -O-SO2~R14 group in cleavage product 6 by<br>
the amine 7. In general, the amine to cleavage product sulfonate group ratio is in the range of about stoichiometric to about 10:1, preferably about stoichiometric to about 8:1, more preferably about stoichiometric to about 4:1.<br>
[0024]     This amination step can be carried out under any conditions typical in the art. Amination can be conducted at atmospheric or at elevated pressure, elevated pressure being especially suitable when amination is performed using relatively low boiling amines such as t-butyl amine.<br>
[0025]     The amination can be conducted at pressures of from about atmospheric (1 bar) to about 100 bars, preferably about 1 to about 50 bars, and at temperatures of from about 40°C to about 200°C, preferably about 40°C to about 125°C. The amination can be performed using reflux, but this is not absolutely necessary. An inert solvent can be optionally used, such as benzene, toluene, diethyl ether, hexane, and the like.<br>
[0026]     Finally, the resultant of the amination step, product 8, is hydrolyzed using a base to yield the final desired product 1. Typical bases include an alkali metal hydroxide, an alkali metal carbonate, or an alkali metal alkoxide, such as sodium hydroxide, sodium carbonate, sodium methoxide, sodium tert-butoxide, etc. Reaction is preferably conducted at from about 20°C to about 110°C, preferably about 20°C to about 50°C. The process can be conducted under reflux.<br>
[0027]     Use of a solvent is optional for the hydrolysis reaction, one being used if the reactants are not already in the liquid form. Solvents can include water, alcohol and mixtures thereof.<br>
[0028]     If alcohols are used, they can be of the same carbon number or are the same alcohols from which the alkoxide bases themselves are derived. Thus,methanol would be a suitable solvent to use where the base is an alkali methoxide.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
[0029]     The preparation of acetvl p-toluenesulfonate. Acetyl p-toluenesulfonate was prepared according to published procedure by reaction of p-toluenesulfonic acid with acetyl chloride. The mixture of p-toluenesulfonic acid monohydrate (50 g, 0.26 mol) in toluene (100 mL) was refluxed in a Dean-Stark apparatus for 3 hours to effect dehydration and the toluene was then evaporated under vacuum. To the residue, acetyl chloride (80 mL, 1 mol) was added and the reaction mixture was refluxed for 5 hours. Then, the excess of acetyl chloride was removed under vacuum to give crude acetyl p-toluenesulfonate (56 g), which contained approximately 25% of p-toluenesulfonic anhydride (according to the NMR spectrum). The crude anhydride was used for further experiments.<br>
[0030]     The preparation of 2-r2-(p-toluenesulfonvloxv)ethoxv1ethvl acetate. This reaction was carried out under neat conditions, that is, no additional solvent was added, the dioxane functioning as both solvent and reactant. The mixture of acetyl p-toluenesulfonate (25 g; contain approximately 18.8 g, 0.088 mol of acetyl p-toluenesulfonate and 6.2 g of p-toluene sulfonic anhydride) in 1,4-dioxane (54 mL, 0.53 mol) was refluxed (101°C) for 50 hours. The reaction progress was monitored by NMR. New sets of multiplets in the range 3.61-3.75 ppm and 4.13-4.18 ppm, which appeared in the 1H NMR spectrum, were assigned to the ethylene glycol fragments of 2-[2-(p-toluenesulfonyloxy)ethoxy] ethyl acetate. According to the NMR data, the approximate degree of conversion was 40-45% after 50 hours of reflux. After 90 hours of reflux the excess 1,4-dioxane was evaporated under vacuum to give 2-[2-(p-toluene-sulfonyloxy)ethoxy]ethyl acetate (21.3 g, 80% yield) of 90% purity, as an oil. JH NMR 8 2.08 (s, 3H), 2.46 (s, 3H), 3.64 (t, J = 4.8 Hz, 2H), 3.70 (t, J = 4.8 Hz,2H), 4.14-A20 (m, 4H), 7.37 (d, J= 8.2 Hz, 2H), 7.81 (d, J = 8.2 Hz, 2H); 13C NMR 8 20.7,21.5, 63.2, 68.5,68.6,69.1, 127.8, 129.7,129.8,144.8,170.8.<br>
[0031]     The reported time in the literature as required for the preparation of 2-[2-(p-toluenesulfonyloxy)ethoxy]ethyl acetate in 87% yield, was 24 hours in acetonitrile solvent [68JACS3878,71JOC532]. Therefore, an additional run was carried out in acetonitrile solution. The mixture of anhydride (7 g) and 1,4-dioxane (15 mL) in acetonitrile (30 mL) was refluxed (82°C) for 24 hours. However, NMR analysis of the reaction mixture showed only 3-5% conversion.<br>
[0032]     Based on the above experimental data, higher temperature for the reaction mixture is required to promote the process of cleavage.<br>
[0033]     The preparation of 2-r2-(p-toluenesulfonvloxv)ethoxv1ethvl acetate at 134-137°C in a sealed tube. The mixture of acetylp-toluenesulfonate (1 g) in dioxane (2.2 g, 5.5 equivalents) was stirred in a sealed tube at 134-137°C for 18 hours to complete conversion (the NMR analysis of the reaction mixture after 8 hours showed approximately 50-60% conversion). Water was then added and the product was extracted with diethyl ether. The extract was dried over magnesium sulfate and solvent was evaporated hi vacuum to give 2-[2-(p-toluenesulfonyloxy)ethoxy]ethyl acetate (1 g, approximately 70%) of 90% purity.<br>
[0034]     The preparation of 2-(2-f-butvlaminoethoxv)ethvl acetate. A mixture of 2-[2-(p-toluenesulfonyloxy)ethoxy]ethyl acetate (3.6 g, 0.012 mol) with f-butylamine (6.95 g, 0.095 mol) in toluene was refluxed for 12 hours. The reaction mixture was then cooled to 0°C and kept for 1 hour at this temperature.
