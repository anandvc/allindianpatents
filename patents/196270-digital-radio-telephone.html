DIGITAL RADIO TELEPHONE FOR A DIGITAL MOBILE RADIO COMMUNICATION SYSTEM<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Field of the Invention<br>
The invention relates to a digital radio telephone used in a digital mobile radio communication system such as a land mobile / portable phone system and a PHS (Personal Handyphone System) adopting a digital telephone system for example. The invention particularly relates to a digital radio telephone having a function of storing a mate telephone number (hereinafter, referred to as "incoming telephone number") and a function of calling the stored phone number (hereinafter, referred to as "incoming redialing function"). Description of the prior art<br>
FIG. 11 shows a system configuration of an analog radio telephone having a conventional incoming redialing function disclosed in a laid-open Japanese patent publication No. 5-14274. This type of conventional telephone receives mate telephone number information of an incoming call together with an analog audio signal via a radio channel using a communication channel in a form of a DTMF (Dual Tone Multi Frequency) signal where a plurality of frequency signals are superposed, and then, stores the telephone number information in a memory.<br>
An operation of the incoming redialing function of the analog radio telephone is explained below. First, a radio signal including a control information received via an antenna 6 using a control channel is demodulated by a radio portion 5 and outputted as a control signal which is an analog signal in a base band. Control information in the demodulated control signal is decoded by a decoder 15 and is processed by a microcomputer 10 to establish the radio channel. Then, a radio signal including the telephone number information received via the antenna 6 using the communication<br><br>
channel is demodulated by the radio portion 5 and outputted as the DTMF signal which is the analog signal in the base band.   The telephone number information in the demodulated DTMF signal is detected, judged, and encoded by a DTMF receiver 16. Then, the output signal from the DTMF signal is processed by the microcomputer 10 and stored in a memory 12. On the other hand, in case of calling by redialing, the telephone number information stored in advance in the memory 12 by the microcomputer 10 is read out, encoded by an encoder 17, modulated by the radio portion 5, then, transmitted from the antenna 6 as a radio signal.<br>
Since the incoming redialing function in the conventional analog radio telephone constructed as explained above requires the DTMF receiver for detecting the telephone number information in addition to the construction for operating the telephone function itself, there is a problem that the conventional analog radio telephone construction is complicated. Also, since the conventional analog radio telephone redials using the telephone number information stored only in the memory, it is difficult to provide an incoming redialing function having high-performance or multifunction in consideration of user service.<br>

In FIG. 3, a telephone number information comparison means 67 compares the telephone number information from the external line information addition means 80 with the telephone number precedingly recorded in the memory 12 and outputs whether these telephone number information are identical to each other. The operating portion 11 gives instructions to compare or not with the telephone number information. A vacant memory judging means 61 judges whether a vacant area exists in the memory 12 to store the telephone number information of a new incoming call according to an output of the telephone number information comparison means 67 ("record all" without comparison or "no identical information" as a result of comparison). Arerecording means 62 deletes unnecessary information (the oldest information or a plurality of identical information) of the incoming record information recorded in the memory 12 according to a judging result of the vacant memory judging means 61 ("no vacancy") or the output of the telephone number information comparison means 67 ("identical information" as a result of comparison) and keeps vacant areas to newly rerecord the remaining incoming record information. A recording means 63 records the telephone number information in a desired area in the memory 12 in correspondence to time information as an incoming record information according to "vacant" as a judging result of the vacant memory judging means 61 or "vacant" as a judging result of the re-recording means 62.<br><br>
FIG. 4 is a flow chart showing an operation of the recording process of the incoming telephone number. The operation of the present embodiment shown in FIG. 2 is explained using FIGS. 3 and 4.<br>
First, in a step 401, the telephone number information detecting means 40 detects whether the telephone number information is included in the control information from the control signal processing portion 9. The process is completed in case the telephone number information is not included. In case telephone number information is included, the extension / external line judging means 70 identifies and judges whether the telephone is in the extension or in the external line in a next step 402. In case the call is in the external line, in a next step 403, the external line information addition means 80 adds external line identifying information ("0" as the external line calling number, for example) to the telephone number information in the control information. In case the call is in the extension, the external line information addition means 80 extracts the telephone number information from the control information and outputs the telephone number information. Then, in a step 404, the time information management means 50 specifies the time when the telephone number information is received. In a next step 405, the operating portion 11 instructs the telephone number information comparison means 67 to process a plurality of identical incoming telephone numbers received so far. In case of recording all the identical incoming telephone numbers, the operation goes to a step 406. In case of recording only the latest incoming telephone number out of the identical incoming telephone numbers, the operation goes to a step 410. In the step 410, the telephone number information comparison means 67 compares the incoming telephone number information recorded so far in an incoming recording memory 121 corresponds to a first memory portion in the memory 12 with the latest incoming telephone number information. In case the incoming telephone number information are not identical to the registered telephone number information, the operation goes to the step 406. On<br><br>
the other hand, in case incoming telephone number information is identical to the registered telephone number information, the operation goes to a step 411. In the step 411, the recording means 63 deletes the incoming telephone number information recorded so far in the incoming recording memory 121 and goes to a step 408. In the step 406, the vacant memory judging means 61 judges whether the area for new incoming telephone number information can be used in the incoming recording memory 121. In case the incoming recording memory 121 is not occupied, the incoming telephone number information is recorded in the incoming recording memory 121 together with the time information. In case the incoming recording memory 121 is occupied, the operation goes to a next step 407, where the telephone number information with the oldest time information is deleted from the incoming recording memory 121. In the next step 408, second oldest telephone number information is incremented and recorded into the location in the incoming recording memory 121 where the oldest time information is deleted. This operation is repeated continuously. In a next step 409, latest incoming telephone number information is finally recorded together with the time information into a location in the vacant incoming recording memory 121, thenafter, the operation is completed. FIG. 5 shows a memory construction of the incoming telephone numbers and their incoming times in the incoming recording memory 121. As shown in FIG. 5, the respective incoming telephone number is stored in each address in combination with its incoming time in the incoming recording memory 121.<br>
FIG. 6 is a flow chart showing an operation of display processes of the incoming telephone number recorded in the incoming recording memory 121. The operation of the display processes is explained below using FIGS. 3 and 6. First, in a step 601, the operating portion 11 instructs to display the incoming telephone number. In a next step 602, a memory record judging means 66 judges whether incoming telephone number information is recorded so far into the incoming recording memory<br><br>
121. In case no incoming telephone number information is recorded so far, in a step 603, a warning sound is given from the speaker 8 to inform that no incoming telephone number information is recorded and also a warning indication is displayed on the display portion 13, then, the display process is completed. In case the incoming telephone number information is recorded, an incoming record reading means 64 reads an incoming telephone number received most recently together with its incoming time out of the incoming recording memory 121, and in a step 604, the display portion 13 displays the telephone number and the incoming time. In a next step 605, the display process finishes according to an instruction of the operating portion 11. In case of displaying other incoming telephone numbers, in a next step 606, the operating portion 11 instructs to switch the display indication of the incoming telephone number. In response to the instruction from the operation portion 11, in a step 607, the display of an immediately preceding incoming telephone number or an immediately succeeding incoming telephone number is switched back and forth. After that, the operation returns to the step 605, then, the steps 605, 606, 607 are repeated until a desired incoming telephone number is displayed.<br>
FIG. 7 shows a displaying order of the incoming telephone numbers when five incoming telephone numbers are recorded. According to the instructions from the operating portion 11, the displayed telephone number circulates in an increment direction or a decrement direction of the recorded incoming telephone numbers one after another. In the above mentioned display processes (steps 604, 607), only the incoming telephone number information and the incoming time recorded in the incoming recording memory 121 are displayed. In case memory dial information corresponding to the incoming telephone number information is registered in a registering memory 122 which is mentioned later, additional information (e.g. name or company name corresponding to the telephone number) in the memory dial information can be displayed as a related information at the same time in addition to the<br><br>
incoming telephone number information. In this case, in steps 604 and 607, the memory dial information in the registering memory 122 is searched (searching means is not shown) using a key word of the incoming telephone number which is read out by the incoming record reading means 64. Then, if the identical telephone number with the incoming telephone number is searched in the incoming record reading means 64, the additional information corresponding to the incoming telephone number is read out from the memory dial reading means 68 and displayed on the display portion 13.<br>
FIG. 8 is a flow chart showing an operation of an incoming redialing process using the incoming telephone number recorded in the incoming recording memory 121. The operation of the incoming redialing process is explained below using FIGS. 3 and 8. First, in a step 801, the operating portion 11 instructs the display portion 13 to display a desired incoming telephone number. The detailed processes from the start to the display indication for displaying the incoming telephone number is the same as the display processes explained using FIG. 6. Next, in a step 802, the operating portion 11 instructs to carry out the incoming redialing. Then, in a next step 803, the telephone number information read out by the incoming record reading means 64 is transmitted as control information from the radio portion 5 to the mate telephone via the control signal processing portion 9 to make a telephone call.<br>
FIG. 9 is a flow chart showing an operation of a memory dial registering process of the incoming telephone number recorded in the incoming recording memory 121. In general, a memory dial function includes functions for registering frequently-used telephone numbers and their related additional information (names, names of companies corresponding to the telephone numbers) in advance as memory dial information, for accessing a desired telephone number or additional information, for displaying it and for making a telephone call with less operations. The registering is explained using FIG. 3. First, a mate telephone number is inputted from the operating portion 11. Then, a registering means 65 registers the telephone number<br><br>
into a desired area in the registering memory 122 which is a second memory portion in the memory 12. At this time, it is possible to register the telephone number corresponding to an abbreviated title of the mate name and so on if required. FIG. 10 shows a storage construction of the mate telephone numbers and the related abbreviation of the mate names. As shown in FIG. 10, the telephone numbers are combined with the corresponding abbreviations and registered in respective addresses in the registering memory 122. An operation of the memory dial registering process of the present invention is explained below using FIGS. 3 and 9. First, in a step 901, a desired incoming telephone number is displayed on the display portion 13 according to the instructions of the operating portion 11.   The detailed processes from the start to the display indication for displaying the incoming telephone number is the same as the display processes explained using FIG. 6. Then, in a step 902, the operating portion 11 instructs to register the memory dial. In a next step 903, the telephone number information read out by the incoming record reading means 64 is registered in a desired area in the registering memory 122, or the second memory portion, via the registering means 65.<br><br><br>
