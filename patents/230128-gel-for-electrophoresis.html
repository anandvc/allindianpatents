				<td>GEL FOR ELECTROPHORESIS<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to an apparatus for gel electrophoresis, in<br>
particular for carrying out horizontal electrophoresis with acrylamide gels.<br>
The present invention is further directed at the safe handling and disposal of<br>
such gels.<br>
Background<br>
Gel electrophoresis, a commonly used method on molecular biology research, is<br>
a technique designed to separate, identify and purify DNA, RNA and protein<br>
molecules based on their weight, size and shape. This technique, which is<br>
simple and rapid to perform, is carried out by first preparing a gel. When the<br>
gel is ready it is placed in a gel box, immersed in a buffer solution, and<br>
connected to a power source. Once stimulated by the electric field that is set up<br>
in the gel, the molecules move through the gel matrix at different rates. The<br>
migration rate for each species of molecule is dependent upon the electrical<br>
charge, the size and shape of the molecules, as well as on the composition of<br>
the gel. Most commonly, the smaller molecules will move through the matrix<br>
at a quicker pace than those of a larger size. Sufficient quantity of buffer<br>
(typically TAE, TBE or protein running buffer) is generally used to ensure that<br>
the electric field is set up in the gel, and that the gel is covered with it and<br>
thus prevent the gel from drying out during electrophoresis. When loading a<br>
sample containing the molecule species of interest into the gel, a loading dye is<br>
typically used. The loading dye normally allows easy visualization of the<br>
solution during the loading process, as well as enabling the density of the<br>
sample to be increased to ensure that the sample is fully and evenly<br>
accommodated in a corresponding well in the gel, and further allows<br>
visualisation of the migration during electrophoresis.<br><br>
The most commonly used gels are prepared with either agarose or acrylanide,<br>
either one of which can be provided in varying shapes, sizes and thicknesses.<br>
The deciding factor as to which particular gel and its physical attributes is<br>
generally related to the size of molecule being separated.<br>
Acrylamide is usually chosen for relatively small molecules such as proteins,<br>
while agarose is used for larger molecules such asDNA or RNA. In any case,<br>
while agarose is the preferred choice for horizoirital gel electrophoresis, being<br>
cast in typically open trays, acrylamide is typically used only for vertical<br>
gel electrophoresis, being cast between two glass plates, and is not used for<br>
horizontal electrophoresis in the art. The reason for this is that acrylamide<br>
does not tend to provide a mechanically stable well structure because the<br>
acrylamide gel is very elastic and its thickness is very thin (up to 1.5mm), and<br>
if used for horizontal gel electrophoresis adjacent wells tend to cave in<br>
negating any possibility to load samples therein. When acrylamide gels are<br>
used in vertical electrophoresis, the depth dimension of the wells is aligned<br>
with the electric field, and relatively deep and narrow wells may be provided<br>
which are substantially well-spaced with respect to neighbouring wells.<br>
Furthermore, in vertical electrophoresis the wells are created between two<br>
parallel spaced vertical glass plates, which by providing two opposed walls for<br>
each well enable the wells to remain stable. However, vertical gel<br>
electrophoresis is not without problems. For example, it is easier to load<br>
samples into horizontal gel wells than in vertical gel wells. It is also difficult to<br>
cast vertical acrylamide gels, particularly gradient gels, and special loading<br>
tips for the samples are required. In vertical gel electrophoresis, one buffer<br>
tank is vertically spaced from the other buffer tank, and it often occurs that<br>
running buffer will leak from the upper tank to the lower tank; eventually, the<br>
upper tank gets drained of buffer severing electrical connection between the<br>
upper electrodes and the gel.<br><br>
Unpolymerised acrylamide is a potent neurotoxin and is absorbed through the<br>
skin. The effects of acrylamide are cumulative. Although polymerised<br>
acrylamide is considered to be non-toxic, it should nevertheless be handled<br>
with care because of the possibility that it may contain small quantities of<br>
unpolymerised acrylamide. Thus, contact with users must be strictly avoided,<br>
particularly when the acrylamide is unpolymerised and/or is in powder form,<br>
during handling and when disposing of the gels after use.<br>
It is therefore an aim of the present invention to provide a device and method<br>
which overcomes the limitations of prior art electrophoresis devices and<br>
methods.<br>
It is another aim of the present invention to provide an acrylamide-based gel<br>
that may be used for horizontal electrophoresis:<br>
It is another aim of the present invention to provide a device for enabling safe<br>
handling and disposal of such gels which may contain harmful substances.<br>
It is another aim of the present invention to provide such a device that is<br>
simple to use.<br>
It is another aim of the present invention to provide such a device that is<br>
relatively simple mechanically and thus economic to produce.<br>
These and other aims are accomplished in the present invention by providing a<br>
precast-gel cassette for horizontal electrophoresis, in particular a disposable<br>
and closed cassette for horizontal electrophoresis. In particular, the cassette<br>
enables the use of acrylamide gels in horizontal electrophoresis. This is<br>
accomplished by precasting a transverse strip of agarose in ionic<br>
communication with the main body of acrylamide gel within the cassette. The<br>
agarose strip enables stable wells to be formed therein (by means of a comb,<br>
for example) for insertion of samples therein. Such a agarose/acrylamide<br>
hybrid gel combination is often difficult to cast in situ by users, and the<br>
acrylamide portion thereof poses safety issues during handling and disposal of<br><br>
the gel. Accordingly, the present invention further provides significant<br>
advantages to users wishing to use acrylamide gels for horizontal<br>
electrophoresis, since the cassette comes prepared with precast, acrylamide gel<br>
and agarose gel included therein.<br>
In another aspect of the invention, the cassette comprises at least one and<br>
preferably a partr of agarose plugs one at each longitudinal open end of the<br>
cassette. The plugs essentially isolate the acrylamide gels from the outside of<br>
the cassette, thereby minimising any possibility of human contact with the<br>
acrylamide gel in the cassette. This is an important safety feature, particularly<br>
in view of the disposability of the cassette, which thus minimises any handling<br>
of toxic substances.<br>
In the preferred embodiment, the cassette comprises a box-like construction,<br>
having a bottom flat base and four vertical walls joined thereto about its<br>
periphery, and an upper cover mountable onto the vertical walls to define a gel<br>
chamber into which gel may be precast. The cassette also comprises openings<br>
at two opposite ends of the bottom base to enable ionic communication between<br>
the gel and an electrolytic solution in which the cassette may be partially<br>
immerged. The openings are preferably comprised in hollow legs running the<br>
transverse length of the cassette at two longitudinal ends thereof, the legs<br>
comprising gel in ionic communication with the main body of gel within the<br>
cassette. This design is particularly adapted for using the cassette with<br>
standard ion exchange chambers. An agarose/acrylamide hybrid gel is<br>
provided within the chamber for performing horizontal electrophoresis, and<br>
agarose gel is provided in the legs to provide ionic communication between the<br>
hybrid gel and the external buffer solutions, while at the same time providing<br>
a safety barrier between the acrylamide gel within the cassette and the outside<br>
thereof.<br>
US 3,888,759 discloses a gel cassette having a substantially box-like<br>
construction, having a downwardly depending transversely extending hollow<br>
leg at each longitudinal end of the cassette. The device appears to be reusable,<br><br>
providing the user with different options, and it appears intended for the user<br>
to cast the gel each time, rather than providing a precast package. There is,<br>
however, no disclosure or any indication of providing a hybrid gel for enabling<br>
horizontal electrophoresis with an acrylamide gel.<br>
US 5,443,704 discloses a substantially box-like container assembly for an<br>
electrophoresis gel, containing more than one precast gel deposited therein.<br>
However, the different gels are provided in a stacked arrangement, which does<br>
not provide the advantages of the present invention at least in terms of<br>
enabling an acrylamide gel to be used for horizontal electrophoresis in<br>
combination with a juxtaposed agarose strip comprising then wells.<br>
US 5,064,769 discloses a gel for immunoassay of a single protein species in<br>
which the horizontal gel comprises a first part made from acrylamide gel<br>
having a proportion of agarose (0.7%) sufficient to enable stable wells to be<br>
formed therein. The first part of the gel is juxtaposed with a second part made<br>
from agarose gel. Acrylamide gel is used in this reference only to eliminate<br>
diffusion effects in the wells, and is not used, nor can it be used successfully, to<br>
form the wells - this is accomplished by the 0.7% agarose. Use of the agarose<br>
gel in the second part of the gel combination is well known for horizontal<br>
electrophoresis. The gel arrangement provided by this reference is in fact the<br>
opposite way round to the present invention, and thus teaches away from the<br>
present invention. There is no disclosure or suggestion regarding using<br>
acrylamide for horizontal gel electrophoresis, or of using agarose therewith for<br>
providing the wells.<br>
In US 3,930,983 an arrangement and process are disclosed for determining<br>
antigens, in which a support plate is coated with an agar or agarose as a<br>
matrix in successive gel strips. However, there is no disclosure or suggestion<br>
that other than the first strip containing the wells the other strips should be<br>
made from acrylamide gel rather than agarose. In fact, it appears that the gel<br>
should be the same for all the strips, the only variable being the monospecific<br>
antiserum contained in each of the strips.<br><br>
US 5,582,702 is directed to a self-contained electrophoresis apparatus<br>
comprising a housing having a gel body accommodated therein together with<br>
ion exchange matrices and electrodes, which are electrically connectable to an<br>
external power source. The apparatus is thus not generally compatible with<br>
existing ion exchange chambers currently used for horizontal electrophoresis.<br>
While it is stated therein that the gel may be from agarose or acrylamide,<br>
there is no disclosure or suggestion of how to overcome the well integrity<br>
problem encountered with acrylamide gels when it is attempted to use the<br>
same for horizontal electrophoresis. In particular, this problem is not<br>
addressed by the reference, and there is no disclosure or suggestion of how to<br>
overcome the same, less so in the manner of the present invention.<br>
WO 95/20155 relates to a sample holder in the form of a well, into which a<br>
sample and a first molten gel is introduced. When the first gel/sample mixture<br>
has solidified, the sample holder is applied against one end of a second gel<br>
slab, such as to bring the first gel/sample solidified mixture in ionic contact<br>
with the second gel. At no time is the first gel in solidified form brought into<br>
contact with the second gel prior to introducing the sample. Thus, the first gel<br>
is in no way adapted for accommodating the sample therein when in the<br>
solidified state, and thus neither discloses nor anticipates the present<br>
invention. The method and apparatus disclosed by the patent still requires the<br>
first gel to be cast (mixed with sample), and further manipulation thereof, in<br>
contrast to the present invention in which the first gel and the second gel may<br>
be precast, and are ready (when solidified) to accommodate therein samples,<br>
typically via wells in the first gel.<br>
WO 99/30145 relates to a slotted electrophoresis gel composition and methods<br>
for use, for providing a multilayered gel for vertical gel electrophoresis. It does<br>
not address, nor provide a solution for, the problem of forming stable sample<br>
wells for horizontal electrophoresis in an acrylamide gel. Specifically, it does<br>
not disclose nor suggest a hybrid gel as in the present invention, but merely a<br>
slotted gel structure having at least three layers:- two primary gel layers on<br>
either side of a slotted second gel layer.<br><br>
EP 471949 discloses a capillary tube for performing capillary zone<br>
electrophoresis. The tube is modified by including a polystyrene frit that<br>
divides the tube into a downstream free zone, and an upstream zone which can<br>
comprise a polyacrylamide stacking gel. The gel plug functions as a filter to<br>
pre-treat the samples that are to be analysed in the free zone of the tube.<br>
W092/17259 describes a method for identifying a solute of interest in an<br>
effluent stream. A sample containing the mixture to be separated is passed<br>
through, a first system capable of partitioning the components of the mixture,<br>
and a detector provides a first output that describes the temporal and/or<br>
• spatial sequence of components exiting the first system. The effluent stream is<br>
then passed through a second system capable of extracting a solute of interest<br>
from the effluent, and a detector provides a second output that describes the<br>
temporal and/or spatial sequence of components exiting the second system,<br>
which no longer includes the solute of interest. The solute of interest can then<br>
be identified in the first output by comparing this to the second output. This<br>
method is thus directed at identifying a substance in a first separating system<br>
by employing a parallel second separating system.<br>

Disclosure of Invention<br>
The present invention is defined by the claims, the contents of which are to be<br>
read as included within the disclosure of the specification, and will now be<br>
described by way of example with reference to the accompanying Figures.<br>
In the present application the word acrylamide is to be understood as relating<br>
also to polyacerylamide, bispolyacrylamide acrylamide based gels and the like,<br>
in addition to its normal meaning or in lieu thereof.<br>
The present invention relates to a solidified hybrid gel matrix for use in an<br>
electrophoresis process, in particular a horizontal electrophoresis process, and<br>
to methods for preparing such gels.<br>
By solidified is meant herein that the gel matrix is no longer in a molten state,<br>
and has "set", "hardened" or "gelled" in a manner known in the art.<br>
Referring to Figure 1, the hybrid gel according to a preferred embodiment<br>
thereof, generally designated by the numeral (36), is typically in the form of a<br>
solidified slab, having a thickness (t), and is characterised in being comprised<br>
of a first portion and a second portion juxtaposed one to the other and at least<br>
in mutual ionic contact when undergoing an electrophoresis process. The first<br>
portion (37) is adapted, when in the solidified state, for subsequently<br>
accommodating therein at least one sample to be electrophoresed, and thus<br>
comprises at least one and preferably a plurality of wells (39). As such, the<br>
first portion (37) is made preferably from agarose, though it need only<br>
comprise sufficient agarose to provide a stable well structure when solidified,<br>
and subsequently when loaded with a sample and during horizontal<br>
electrophoresis. In the latter case in particular, i.e., when the first portion only<br>
comprises small amounts of agarose, the first portion may also comprise other<br>
rnaterials including other types of gels, so long as this portion still provided a<br>
stable well structure and does not block the migration of molecules form the<br>
wells. There are also other less suitable substances derived from agar which,<br>
while providing stable wells do not enable the efficient migration of molecules.<br><br>
The second portion (38) is made from acrylamide, or substantially therefrom,<br>
and is juxtaposed with the first portion such as to enable ionic communication<br>
between the two portions, as well as to enable molecules migrating from the<br>
wells (39) in the first portion (37) to continue migrating through the second<br>
portion (38). Thus, the hybrid gel (36) according to the present invention<br>
enables horizontal electrophoresis of samples in which the preferred gel is<br>
acrylamide or acrylamide-based gels, in applications, for example, such as the<br>
separation of small nucleic acids (DNA and UNA), or proteins (using SDS-<br>
acrylamide gel in the second portion (38).<br>
Typically, the first portion (37) and the second portion (38) are arranged in<br>
series, and may be provided in solidified form pre-cast in suitable trays, or<br>
may be cast in-situ as required. In most cases, the first portion (37) is cast<br>
first, and this may be done by providing a closed tray having a pouring<br>
aperture, and turning the tray vertically such that the aperture is uppermost.<br>
The first gel portion, typically agarose, is then poured in the molten or fluid<br>
state into the tray via the aperture up to the required height, and when set the<br>
second gel portion, typically acrylamide gel is then poured to the top of the<br>
tray. When both gels are set, i.e. solidified, the tray may be turned back to its<br>
normal horizontal orientation, and suitable wells (39) formed therein, typically<br>
by means of a comb, via suitable apertures in the tray, or by first opening the<br>
top of the tray. Alternatively, the second portion (38) may be cast first while<br>
the closed tray is vertical, by pouring the acrylamide to the required height<br>
through the aperture. The tray is then turned back to the horizontal<br>
orientation, and the agarose is pored in the remainder of the tray, and suitable<br>
wells (39) are formed therein as before.<br>
Alternatively, the hybrid gel (36) may be cast in an open tray by first providing<br>
a temporary transverse retaining wall within the tray, displaced<br>
longitudinally with respect to one longitudinal end thereof, to define a<br>
subchamber therebetween into which agarose gel is poured and set. Next, the<br>
temporary retaining wall is removed, and the tray is closed via a suitable lid,<br>
and acrylamide gel is poured into the remainder of the tray, typically to the<br><br>
same level as the agarose in the first gel portion (37) to form the second gel<br>
portion (38). The second gel portion (38) is thus in contact with the first gel<br>
portion (37). Wells (39) may be provided in the normal manner, for example as<br>
described above.<br>
Typically, the first portion (37) and the second portion (38) are provided in two<br>
serially juxtaposed portions, as described above with reference to Figure 1.<br>
Nonetheless, other configurations are also possible. For example, and referring<br>
to Figure 2, in a second embodiment of the hybrid gel (36'), the first portion<br>
(37') could be provided as a "plug" (35') of agarose (or similar) gel having<br>
suitable wells (39'), the plug (35') being surrounded by a second portion (38') of<br>
acrylamide (or similar) gel.<br>
For electrophoresis of small fragments of nucleic acids (DNA and UNA), the gel<br>
thickness (t) of at least the second portion (38) is typically from about 0.3mm<br>
to about 4mrn, while for the electrophoresis of proteins the corresponding gel<br>
thickness (t) is typically from about 1mm to about 2mm.<br>
While typically the first gel portion (37) has substantially the same thickness<br>
as the second gel portion (38) this need not necessarily be so for all<br>
embodiments of the hybrid gel (36).<br>
The present invention also relates to a device, or apparatus, and method for<br>
horizontal electrophoresis based on such a hybrid gel (37), comprising a first<br>
portion comprising an agarose gel in juxtaposition with a second gel portion<br>
comprising an acrylamide gel, in which the first portion is adapted for<br>
receiving samples that are to undergo horizontal electrophoresis. In particular,<br>
the present invention also relates to a cassette-type device containing such a<br>
hybrid gel, the gel being preferably pre-cast therein. Preferably, such a<br>
cassette is also provided with suitable traps for minimising contact of the<br>
acrylamide gel with the external environment including users. Such traps<br>
typically comprise a barrier gel substance like agarose which isolates the<br>
acrylamide gel from the outside of the cassette thereby minimising any<br><br>
possibility of human contact with the acrylamide gel in the cassette. This gel<br>
substance contains an electrolytic solution to enable ionic communication<br>
between the gel and the external electrolytic solution.<br>
Such an apparatus is preferably disposable, but may also be re-usable for a<br>
host of applications. The term "disposable" in the present application means<br>
that the devices axe designed (in corresponding embodiments) to be thrown<br>
away or otherwise disposed off after one use with only negligible economic loss.<br>
Such negligible economic loss may be comparable, for example, to the economic<br>
loss incurred, in disposing of plastic pipettes for handling liquids or eppendorf<br>
tubes. While these items may be used more than once, they are nonetheless<br>
typically thrown away after a single use, this being more cost effective than<br>
cleaning and/or sterilising the same for subsequent use.<br>
Referring to the Figures, Figures 3 to 6 illustrate a preferred embodiment of<br>
the present invention. The apparatus or cassette, designated by the numeral<br>
(1), comprises a housing (100) of a box-like construction, comprising a first<br>
chamber (30) adapted for accommodating a hybrid gel (36) for electrophoresis.<br>
Optionally, a barrier substance is accommodated in a second chamber (40).<br>
Such a barrier substance may comprise a substance adapted for providing an<br>
acrylamide barrier, i.e., a barrier for separating acrylamide in the hybrid gel<br>
(36) from the outside of the cassette (1). Alternatively, the barrier substance<br>
may comprise an absorbtion material capable of retaining therein at least one<br>
target substance migrating thereto from the hybrid gel (36), and preventing<br>
such a target substance from exiting the cassette (1), and described more fully<br>
in co-pending Israel Patent Application No. 139447, the contents of which are<br>
incorporated herein in their entirety.<br>
The cassette (1) comprises a stepped bottom base (10) having a flat upper part<br>
(11) and a flat but shorter lower part (13) joined longitudinally one to the other<br>
by a first intermediate vertical wall (15). Two side walls (12), (14) run the<br>
longitudinal length of the cassette and are preferably integrally joined to the<br>
base (10) and to end walls (16) and (18) at opposite longitudinal ends of the<br>
cassette (1). A second intermediate wall (19) is joined to side walls (12) and<br><br>
(14) at a longitudinal location between first intermediate wall (15) at the end<br>
wall (18) closest thereto. The second intermediate wall (19) substantially<br>
divides each side wall (12) and (14) longitudinally into longer portions (12')<br>
and (14"), respectively, extending between the end wall (16) and intermediate<br>
wall (19), and shorter portions (12") and (14"), respectively, extending between<br>
the intermediate wall (19) and the other end wall (18). The upper edge of the<br>
second intermediate wall (19) is substantially coplanar with the upper edge of<br>
end wall (16) and with the upper edges of at least the longer side wall portions<br>
(12') and (14'), and thus enable an upper cover (50) to be releasably and<br>
sealingly mounted thereonto. Upper cover (50) may comprise optionally<br>
closable apertures (51) and (53) longitudinally spaced one from the other along<br>
the mid-line of the cover (50). These apertures (51), (53) facilitate pouring of<br>
gel into the cassette (1) when the cover (50) is in place, described in greater<br>
detail hereinbelow. Thus, the second intermediate wall (19), end wall (16) and<br>
the longer side wall portions (12') and (14'), together with upper cover (50) and<br>
the upper part (11) of the base (10)define the first chamber (30) of the cassette<br>
(1). The second chamber (40) of the cassette is correspondingly defined by the<br>
second intermediate wall (19), end wall (18) and the shorter side wall portions<br>
(12") and (14"), together with upper wall (55) and the lower part (13) of the<br>
base (10). Upper wall (55) may optionally be joined typically integrally with<br>
the second intermediate wall (19), end wall (18) and the shorter side wall<br>
portions (12") and (14"). Preferably, though, and as illustrated in Figures 3 and<br>
6, upper wall (55) is integrally joined to the upper cover (50) and is releasably<br>
and sealingly mountable onto the upper edges of the second intermediate wall<br>
(19), end wall (18) and the shorter side wall portions (12") and (14"). The lower<br>
edge of the second intermediate wall (19), however, does not extend as far as<br>
the lower part (13) of the base (10), and thus communication between the first<br>
chamber (30) and second chamber (40) is provided by virtue of the longitudinal<br>
gap between the first and second intermediate walls, (15) and (19),<br>
respectively.<br>
Thus, in the preferred embodiment of the apparatus, the first chamber (30) is<br>
partially superposed over the second chamber (40), defining an area (31) where<br><br>
the two chambers overlap horizontally. At least a portion of this area (31) has<br>
an opening, or preferably is open, providing communication between the first<br>
chamber (30) and the second chamber (40).<br>
Preferably, the cassette (1) or other embodiments thereof is provided with a<br>
suitable hybrid gel matrix (36) accommodated in the first chamber (30)<br>
according to the present invention. A suitable barrier substance, typically in<br>
the form of a second gel matrix (48), is accommodated in the second chamber<br>
(40) and may also be provided pre-cast within the cassette (1). Alternatively,<br>
the cassette (1) or other embodiments thereof may be provided without one or<br>
both these gels, which can be cast as and when needed. In any case, the hybrid<br>
gel matrix (36) is adapted for performing horizontal electrophoresis therein.<br>
The second gel matrix (48) is typically adapted for providing a barrier between<br>
the aciylamide comprised in the hybrid gel (typically in the second portion<br>
(38), but sometimes also comprised in the first portion (37)), preventing contact<br>
therewith via the opening (42), while at the same time allowing ionic<br>
communication between the outside of the cassette and the hybrid gel (36) via<br>
the second gel matrix (48) and the opening (42).<br>
Top cover (50), and preferably the rest of housing (100) is made from any<br>
suitable ultraviolet-transparent material. Preferably, the whole of the cassette<br>
(1), in particular the housing (100), is made from an economically disposable<br>
material.<br>
Optionally, a tab (57) is provided at one end of the cover (50), and a<br>
corresponding platform (58) is provided at end (16), preferably integrally<br>
joined thereto, such that the tab (57) is in registry with platform (58) and<br>
mutually spaced by space (59) when the cover (50) is in place over chamber<br>
(30). By placing a suitable flattened tool such as a screwdriver or key (not<br>
shown), for example, within space (59) and rotating it by 90°, say, the cover<br>
(50) may be snapped open and thus removed from the chamber (30).<br><br>
Having an openable cover (50) is important in applications, for example, where<br>
it is required to remove some of the second gel portion (38) for further<br>
processing such as electroelution or transfer of molecules from the second gel<br>
portion (38) to a membrane (western blot or northern blot).<br>
The cassette (1) also comprises openings at two opposite ends of the bottom<br>
base (10) to enable direct or indirect ionic communication between the hybrid<br>
gel (38) that is accommodated in the cassette (1) and an electrolytic solution in<br>
which the cassette (1) may be partially immersed. Thus, transverse opening<br>
(32) at longitudinal end of the upper part (11) of the base (10) near end wall<br>
(16) provides communication between the first chamber (30) and the outside of<br>
the cassette (1). Similarly, transverse opening (42) at longitudinal end of the<br>
lower part (11) of the base (10) near end wall (18) provides communication<br>
between the second chamber (40) and the outside of the cassette (1).<br>
Openings (32) and (42) serve to provide ionic communication between the gels<br>
accommodated within the cassette (1) and external ionic solutions, and thus<br>
enable electrophoresis to be conducted within the cassette (1) with the<br>
provision of a suitable electric field. Preferably, though, the openings at the<br>
bottom base (10) are in the form of substantially hollow leg members running<br>
the transverse length of the cassette (1) at two longitudinal ends thereof, the<br>
leg members also being capable of accommodating gel in ionic communication<br>
with the main body of gel accommodated within the cassette (1). This inverted-<br>
U design is particularly adapted for using the cassette (1) with standard ion<br>
exchange chambers, which are generally in the form of two juxtaposed buffer-<br>
containing troughs separated by an elevated platform which is ideal for<br>
supporting the base (10) of cassette (1). One leg member extends downwardly<br>
into one trough, and the other leg member into the second trough to provide<br>
ionic communication at least between the gel contained in the legs and the<br>
corresponding buffer solutions in the troughs, and between the gels in the leg<br>
members via the hybrid gel (36) and the second gel matrix (48). One trough<br>
has a cathode and the other trough has an anode.<br><br>
Thus, the cassette (1) optionally, and preferably, comprises hollow legs (60)<br>
and (70) provided at opposite longitudinal ends thereof. At one end of the<br>
cassette (1), leg (60) is defined by a downwards extension of end wall (16),<br>
together with downwardly extending tab-like projections (62), (64) at the end<br>
of longer side wall portions (12") and (14"), respectively, and a fourth wall (65)<br>
projecting downwards from the upper part (11) of base (10). Similarly, leg (70)<br>
at the other longitudinal end of the cassette (1) is defined by a downwards<br>
extension of end wall (18), together with downwardly extending tab-like<br>
projections (72), (74) at the end of shorter side wall portions (12') and (14'),<br>
respectively, and a corresponding fourth wall (75) projecting downwards from<br>
the lower part (13) of base (10). Each leg (60), (70) is open at the corresponding<br>
bottom end, (66) and (76) respectively, thereof, which may be temporarily<br>
closed (at least prior to use of the cassette (1)) by means of suitable removable<br>
adhesive strips (not shown) adhered thereto. The bottom ends (66), (76) are in<br>
communication with the first chamber (30) and second chamber (40),<br>
respectively, via the transverse openings (32) and (42), respectively.<br>
As mentioned hereinbefore, the first chamber (30) is adapted to accommodate<br>
a suitable hybrid gel matrix (36) adapted for horizontal electrophoresis.<br>
Referring in particular to Figure 6, the first gel portion (37) of the hybrid gel<br>
(36) is provided at a longitudinal end of chamber (30) closest to intermediate<br>
wall (19), and enables a relatively stable well structure comprising one and<br>
preferably a plurality of wells (39) to be provided for accepting samples that<br>
are to undergo electrophoresis. The second gel portion (38) is accommodated<br>
between the first gel portion (37) and end wall (16).<br>
The wells (39) may be formed by a comb (80), for example, having teeth (84)<br>
that are typically inserted into the first gel portion (37) via corresponding<br>
apertures (52) comprised in the cover (50). Alternatively, a common slit may be<br>
provided in the cover (50) in place of the individual apertures (52). Typically,<br>
the comb (80) is kept in place engaged with respect to the cover (50) until the<br>
cassette (1) is used, whereupon samples may be introduced into one or more<br>
wells (39) via corresponding apertures (52). After use, and before disposing of<br><br>
the cassette (1), the apertures (52) are preferably again closed by means of the<br>
comb (80).<br>
The agarose/acrylamide hybrid gel (36) is preferably provided precast in the<br>
first chamber (30). In any case, the agarose/acrylamide gel according to the<br>
present invention may be formed by introducing a temporary transverse<br>
retaining wall (not shown) within chamber (30), displaced longitudinally with<br>
respect to intermediate wall (19) to define a subchamber therebetween into<br>
which agarose gel is poured and set. Next, the temporary retaining wall is<br>
removed, and acrylamide gel is poured into the remainder of the first chamber<br>
(30) to the same level as the agarose in the first gel portion (37) to form the<br>
second gel portion (38). Another method of casting the agarose/acrylamide<br>
hybrid gel is by turning the cassette (1) vertically such that the end wall (16) is<br>
uppermost. Acrylamide gel is then poured into the chamber (30) up to the<br>
required height (which typically corresponds to the horizontal extent of the<br>
acrylamide when the cassette (1) is returned to its horizontal position). Then,<br>
with the cassette (1) still in the vertical position, agarose is poured into the<br>
chamber (30) until the latter is filled as required. With this method, the<br>
acrylamide and agarose gels may be poured into the chamber via apertures<br>
(51) and (53), respectively, or both via aperture (53). Other ways of casting the<br>
hybrid gel are also possible. Wells (39) may be formed in the normal manner<br>
using, for example, a comb (80).<br>
However, the step of casting the hybrid gel matrix (36) is usually performed<br>
after the second gel matrix (48) is cast, which is typically performed after the<br>
gels (69) and (79) are cast, as described hereinbelow.<br>
In the preferred embodiment of the apparatus according to the present<br>
invention, a first acrylamide barrier (90) is optionally provided for preventing<br>
contact between the acrylamide portions of the hybrid gel (36) and the external<br>
environment, particularly during handling of the cassette (1) and disposal<br>
thereof, while at the same time permitting ionic communication therebetween.<br>
Acrylamide, comprised mainly in the second gel portion (38), but also<br>
optionally present in the first gel portion (37), is toxic and/or carcinogenic and<br><br>
therefore potentially harmful to the cassette operator and to the environment.<br>
Preferably, a second acrylamide barrier (95) is provided at the opposed<br>
longitudinal end of the cassette (1).<br>
The first acrylamide barrier (90) is provided in the form of the second chamber<br>
(40) as a buffer zone between the acrylamide and the opening (42), thus<br>
preventing contact via this opening. Second chamber (40) -which is in open<br>
communication with first chamber (30), and at least in ionic communication<br>
therewith when both chambers are accommodating gels - is provided with any<br>
suitable acrylamide barrier material, such as agarose gel, or agar gel for<br>
example., or any other suitable safety gel material. Preferably, the first<br>
acrylamide barrier extends into the second leg (70).<br>
A second acrylamide barrier (95) is provided at the other longitudinal end of<br>
the cassette (1) as a buffer zone between the acrylamide and the opening (32),<br>
thus preventing contact via this opening. The second trap (95) is economically<br>
provided by the hollow leg (60), which comprises agarose gel, for example, or<br>
any other suitable barrier material;<br>
Thus, even if openings (76) and (66) in legs (70) and (60), respectively, remain<br>
unsealed, the acrylamide comprised in the hybrid gel (36) is not exposed to the<br>
external environment.<br>
The acrylamide barriers (90), (95) are generally prepared before casting the<br>
hybrid gel (36) in the first, electrophoresis, chamber (30). With the cover (50),<br>
including portion (55) off, and with the bottom ends of the legs (60) and (70)<br>
sealed with suitable adhesive peel-off tape, agarose gel (79), or another<br>
suitable barrier substance is poured into leg (70) and chamber (40), up to the<br>
level of the upper part (11) of base (10). Concurrently or subsequently, agarose<br>
gel (69), or another suitable barrier substance is poured into leg (60) preferably<br>
up to the level of the upper part (11) of base (10). When the gels (79) and (69)<br>
are set, the agarose/acrylamide hybrid gel (36) may be poured and set in the<br>
first chamber (30) as hereinbefore described.<br><br>
Alternatively, a simpler cassette (1) may be provided without the first<br>
acrylamide barrier (90), and indeed the second acrylamide barrier (95), if it is<br>
so desired.<br>
In such a cases, the cassette (1) may be provided without the second chamber<br>
(40) leading to a simplified structure. Thus the base (10) only comprises upper<br>
portion (11), the side walls (12), (14) do not include the shorter side wall<br>
portions (12'), (14'), respectively, and the intermediate wall (19) is replaced by<br>
end wall (18). Similarly, upper wall (55) is not required.<br>
While the first acrylamide barrier (90) has been described as being in the form<br>
of a second chamber (40) at a level below that of the first chamber (30),<br>
optionally further comprising leg (70), and accommodating a suitable barrier<br>
substance, this need not generally be so. Similarly, the second acrylamide<br>
barrier, while described for the preferred embodiment as being in the form of<br>
leg (60) comprising a suitable barrier substance, this also need not necessarily<br>
be so. Minimally, the first acrylamide barrier (90) and the second acrylamide<br>
barrier (95) each need only to be adapted to provide ionic communication<br>
between the outside of the cassette (1), via leg (70) and leg (60) respectively,<br>
and the hybrid gel (36) comprised in the first chamber (30), and comprise a<br>
suitable barrier material between the outside of the cassette (1) and the<br>
acrylamide in the hybrid gel (36), typically the second portion (38) thereof. Any<br>
configuration of first acrylamide barrier (90) and/or of the second acrylamide<br>
barrier (95) meeting these criteria is/are generally suitable. Thus, in a more<br>
simplified cassette, for example, a single chamber is provided, in which one<br>
end thereof, and preferably both ends thereof, are each provided with a barrier<br>
material such as agarose gel, for example, juxtaposed with and in<br>
communication with hybrid gel accommodated within the chamber for<br>
electrophoresis. Thus, while the first acrylamide barrier (90) comprises second<br>
chamber (40) as well as the leg (70), optionally a Simpler cassette (1) may be<br>
provided without the second chamber (40), if it is so desired.<br><br>
Further optionally, the cassette (1) may also be provided without the said<br>
hollow legs (60) and (70), leading to a further simplified structure. Thus<br>
communication between said first chamber (30) and external ionic solutions is<br>
via opening (32) and opening (42) in the base (10).<br>
Thus, referring to Figure 7, a second embodiment of the apparatus of the<br>
present invention comprises a housing (200) having a base (210) and<br>
peripheral walls joined thereto at a lower end thereof, to define a chamber<br>
(234). A hybrid gel matrix (236), similar to the hybrid gel matrix (36) of the<br>
first embodiment, mutatis mutandis, is accommodated in the chamber (234)..<br>
The chamber (234) comprises openings (232) and (242) at longitudinal ends of<br>
the base (210) for providing ionic communication between the hybrid gel<br>
matrix (236) and one common (or a pair of spaced) external buffer solution.<br>
Wells (239) are provided in the hybrid gel matrix (236) for introducing samples<br>
to be electrophoresed. Optionally, a cover plate (250) may be provided, having<br>
suitable openings (252) for a comb (280) to be inserted therein to form wells<br>
(239). In this embodiment, the first portion (237) of the hybrid gel (236) also<br>
acts as a first acrylamide barrier (290).<br>
A third embodiment of the present invention comprises a housing (300) having<br>
all the components of the second embodiment as described above, mutatis<br>
mutandis, and is illustrated in Figure 8. In addition, though the chamber<br>
(234) further comprises a second acrylamide barrier (295) in the form of a third<br>
gel portion (235) juxtaposed and in ionic communication with the hybrid gel<br>
matrix (236), but located at the opposed longitudinal end of the housing (200)<br>
with relation to the first gel portion (237) of the hybrid gel (236). The third gel<br>
matrix (235) comprises a suitable barrier substance and provides for ionic<br>
communication between the hybrid gel (236) and the outside of the chamber<br>
(234) via opening (242).<br><br>
A fourth embodiment of the present invention comprises a housing (400)<br>
having all the components of the second embodiment as described above,<br>
mutatis mutandis, and is illustrated in Figure 9. In addition, though, the<br>
chamber (234) further comprises a pair or leg members (270), (260), which<br>
downwardly extend the openings (32), (42) respectively, similar to the leg<br>
members (70) and (60), respectively, of the preferred embodiment, mutatis<br>
mutandis. The first acrylamide trap (290) may thus be independent of the first<br>
gel portion (237) of the hybrid gel (236), and be comprised in the leg (70) in the<br>
form of a suitable barrier material (279) such as agarose, and this may be so in<br>
applications in which the first gel portion (237) may also comprise some<br>
acrylamide. Alternatively, the first acrylamide barrier (290) may comprise<br>
both the first portion (237) of the hybrid gel (236) together with agarose or<br>
similar barrier substance (279) in leg (70). The second acrylamide barrier (295)<br>
may be in the form of a fourth gel portion (269) juxtaposed and in ionic<br>
communication with the hybrid gel matrix (236), but located within leg (60) at<br>
the other longitudinal end of the housing (200) with relation to the other leg<br>
(270). The fourth gel matrix (269) thus comprises a suitable barrier substance<br>
and provides for ionic communication between the hybrid gel (236) and the<br>
outside of the chamber (234) via opening (242).<br>
While the hybrid gel and the apparatus for accommodating the same according<br>
to the present invention have been described herein with reference to<br>
horizontal gel electrophoresis, the present invention is not limited thereto, and<br>
can be applied to other forms of electrophoresis including vertical<br>
electrophoresis as well as two dimensional gel (2D gel), mutatis mutandis.<br>
While in the foregoing description describes in detail only a few specific<br>
embodiments of the invention, it will be understood by those skilled in the art<br>
that the invention is not limited thereto and that other variations in form and<br>
details may be possible without departing from the scope and spirit of the<br>
invention herein disclosed.<br><br>
We Claim :<br>
1.	A solidified hybrid gel (36), (236) for the horizontal electrophoresis of<br>
at least one sample within an acrylamide gel, said hybrid gel comprising a<br>
substantially solidified first gel portion (37), (237) in communication with a<br>
substantially solidified second gel portion (38), (238), characterized in that<br>
said solidified first gel portion (37), (237) comprises at least sufficient agarose<br>
for enabling accommodation therein of at least one sample for electrophoresis<br>
after said first gel portion (37), (237) is in solidified form, and in that the<br>
