				<td>SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR ESTIMATING VOLUMETRIC EFFICIENCY FOR<br>
ENGINES WITH INTAKE AND EXHAUST CAM PHASERS<br>
CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
[0001] This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional<br>
Application No. 60/961,546, filed on July 20, 2007. The disclosure of the above<br>
application is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.<br>
FIELD<br>
[0002] The present disclosure relates to engine control systems, and<br>
more particularly to engine control systems for engines with intake and exhaust<br>
cam phasers.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0003] The statements in this section merely provide background<br>
information related to the present disclosure and may not constitute prior art.<br>
[0004] In a four-stroke naturally aspirated engine, the theoretical<br>
maximum amount of air that each cylinder can ingest during the intake cycle is<br>
equal to the swept volume of the cylinder. Since each cylinder has one intake<br>
stroke every two revolutions of the crankshaft, the theoretical maximum volume<br>
of air ingested during each rotation of the crankshaft is equal to one-half the<br>
displacement. The actual amount of air that the engine ingests compared to the<br>
theoretical maximum is called volumetric efficiency (VE).<br><br>
[0005] There are many factors that determine the amount of torque an<br>
engine can produce and the RPM at which the maximum torque occurs. One<br>
determinant is the mass of air the engine can ingest into the cylinders. There is a<br>
strong relationship between VE and maximum torque. Generally, the RPM at<br>
peak VE coincides with the RPM at the torque peak.<br>
[0006] VE has been calculated using lookup tables for engines without<br>
intake and exhaust cam phasers. Lookup tables can be cumbersome when<br>
intake and exhaust cam phasers are added. Mathematical relationships can be<br>
used to handle the complexity of VE with intake and exhaust cam phasers.<br>
However, mathematical relationships tend to increase calibration effort and time.<br>
Accuracy may also be reduced.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
[0007] An engine control module comprises a table that generates a<br>
parked VE estimate based on engine speed and load when intake and exhaust<br>
cam phasers of an engine are in a parked position. A calculation module<br>
calculates a VE estimate using a mathematical relationship based on the parked<br>
VE estimate and the engine speed and load when the intake and exhaust cam<br>
phasers are not in a parked position.<br>
[0008] In other features, an addition module may generate an addition<br>
term based on a first mathematical relationship. The first mathematical<br>
relationship may be based on manifold absolute pressure (MAP), engine speed<br><br>
(RPM), an intake cam phaser (ICAM) position and an exhaust cam phaser<br>
(ECAM) position. The first mathematical relationship may be:<br>
fadd(ICAM,ECAM,MAP,RPM) = b1ICAM + b2ECAM + b3ICAM*ECAM +<br>
b4ICAM2 +b5ECAM2 +b6ICAM*MAP + b7ECAM*MAP + b8RPM*ICAM +<br>
b9RPM*ECAM + b10RPM*MAP*ICAM*ECAM<br>
where b1..10 are calibration coefficients.<br>
[0009] In other features, the calculation module may comprise a<br>
multiplication module that generates a multiplication term based on a second<br>
mathematical relationship. The second mathematical relationship may be based<br>
on manifold absolute pressure (MAP), engine speed (RPM), an intake cam<br>
phaser position (ICAM) and an exhaust cam phaser position (ECAM). The<br>
second mathematical relationship may be:<br>
fmult(ICAM,ECAM,MAP,RPM) = 1+ a1ICAM + a2ECAM + a3ICAM*ECAM +<br>
a4 ICAM2 +a5ECAM2 +a6ICAM*MAP + a7ECAM*MAP + a8MAP2*ICAM*ECAM +<br>
a9RPM*ICAM*ECAM + a10RPM2*ICAM*ECAM<br>
where a1..10 are calibration coefficients.<br>
[0010] In other features, the calculation module may comprise a VE<br>
calculation module that calculates the VE estimate using a third mathematical<br>
relationship based on the parked VE estimate, the addition term and the<br>
multiplication term. The third mathematical relationship may be:<br>
VE= VE parked X f mult + fadd<br>
wherein the addition term is fadd and the multiplication term is fmult.<br>
[0011] In other features, the engine control module may adjust at least<br>
one engine parameter based on VE. The engine control module may calculate at<br><br>
least one of cylinder mass air flow, torque and an air/fuel ratio based on the VE<br>
estimate.<br>

description provided herein. It should be understood that the description and<br>
specific examples are intended for purposes of illustration only and are not<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0024] The following description of the embodiments is merely<br>
exemplary in nature and is in no way intended to limit the disclosure, its<br>
application, or uses. For purposes of clarity, the same reference numbers will be<br>
used in the drawings to identify similar elements. As used herein, the term<br>
module refers to an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), an electronic<br>
circuit, a processor (shared, dedicated, or group) and memory that execute one<br>
or more software or firmware programs, a combinational logic circuit, or other<br>
suitable components that provide the described functionality.<br>
[0025] The present disclosure uses a table look-up to determine the VE<br>
with the cam phasers in the "park" position. A mathematical function is then<br>
used to represent the intake and exhaust cam phaser effects. This mathematical<br><br>
function may be based on engine speed, load, intake camshaft position, exhaust<br>
camshaft position and/or other sensed or modeled variables. Since the<br>
mathematical function only has to represent the effects of the intake and exhaust<br>
cam phasers, calibration is easier and more accurate.<br>
[0026] Real-time estimation of VE in an engine control module ensures<br>
correct cylinder air mass estimation for the engine. Cylinder air mass estimation<br>
ensures correct air/fuel ratio control during combustion and may be used to meet<br>
emissions and driveability requirements. The engine control module adjusts at<br>
least one engine parameter based on the VE estimate. For example only, the<br>
engine control module calculates at least one of cylinder mass air flow, torque<br>
and an air/fuel ratio based on the VE estimate.<br>
[0027] For engines without cam phasers, VE may be represented as a<br>
function of engine speed (RPM) and load (usually represented by manifold<br>
pressure (MAP), throttle position or other parameter). In these circumstances,<br>
the table look-up approach is widely used because effective calibration methods<br>
are known. With intake and exhaust cam phasers, VEE may be represented as a<br>
function of RPM, MAP, and cam position (ICAM for intake cam position and<br>
ECAM for exhaust cam). Table lookups can be used under these circumstances,<br>
but the high dimensionality of the table tends to be expensive to calibrate and<br>
store.<br>
[0028] For engines with intake and exhaust cam phasers,<br>
mathematical approximations for VE may be used. While these mathematical<br>
functions are easier to calibrate and store, the VE table is no longer part of the<br><br>
calibration process. Many calibrators have experience manipulating VE tables to<br>
achieve engine control goals. Calibrators generally are not as skilled at<br>
manipulating VE functions when they are represented functionally. Moreover,<br>
many of the functional approximation methods suffer from accuracy problems or<br>
require an excessive number of parameters, which raises calibration and<br>
memory storage costs.<br>
[0029] The present disclosure describes a hybrid method for<br>
representing VE that maintains the advantages of table lookup and mathematical<br>
functional representation while mitigating drawbacks of each.<br>
[0030] Referring now to FIG. 1, an exemplary engine system 10 with<br>
intake and exhaust cam phasers is shown. The engine system 10 includes an<br>
engine 12 that combusts an air and fuel mixture to produce drive torque. Air is<br>
drawn into an intake manifold 14 through a throttle 16. The throttle 16 regulates<br>
mass air flow into the intake manifold 14. Air within the intake manifold 14 is<br>
distributed into cylinders 18. Although a single cylinder 18 is illustrated, the<br>
engine system 10 may be implemented in engines having a plurality of cylinders<br>
including, but not limited to, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8,10 and 12 cylinders.<br>
[0031] A fuel injector (not shown) injects fuel that combines with the air<br>
as it is drawn into the cylinder 18 through an intake port. The fuel injector may<br>
be an injector associated with an electronic or mechanical fuel injection system<br>
20, a jet or port of a carburetor or another system for mixing fuel with intake air.<br>
The fuel injector is controlled to provide a desired air-to-fuel (A/F) ratio within<br>
each cylinder 18.<br><br>
[0032] An intake valve 22 selectively opens and closes to enable the<br>
air/fuel mixture to enter the cylinder 18. The intake valve position is regulated by<br>
an intake cam shaft 24. A piston (not shown) compresses the air/fuel mixture<br>
within the cylinder 18. A spark plug 26 initiates combustion of the air/fuel<br>
mixture, driving the piston in the cylinder 18. The piston drives a crankshaft (not<br>
shown) to produce drive torque. Combustion exhaust within the cylinder 18 is<br>
forced out an exhaust port when an exhaust valve 28 is in an open position. The<br>
exhaust valve position is regulated by an exhaust cam shaft 30. The exhaust is<br>
treated in an exhaust system and is released to atmosphere. Although single<br>
intake and exhaust valves 22, 28 are illustrated, it is appreciated that the engine<br>
12 can include multiple intake and exhaust valves 22, 28 per cylinder 18.<br>
[0033] The engine system 10 further includes an intake cam phaser 32<br>
and an exhaust cam phaser 34 that respectively regulate the rotational timing<br>
and/or lift of the intake and exhaust cam shafts 24, 30. More specifically, the<br>
timing of the intake and exhaust cam shafts 24,30 can be retarded or advanced<br>
with respect to each other or with respect to a location of the piston within the<br>
cylinder 18 or crankshaft position. In this manner, the position of the intake and<br>
exhaust valves 22, 28 can be regulated with respect to each other or with respect<br>
to a location of the piston within the cylinder 18. By regulating the position of the<br>
intake valve 22 and the exhaust valve 28, the quantity of air/fuel mixture ingested<br>
into the cylinder 18 can be regulated. Additionally, the quantity of exhaust vented<br>
through the exhaust valve 28 can be regulated.<br><br>
[0034] A control module 40 generates a throttle control signal based on<br>
a position of an accelerator pedal (not shown) and a throttle position signal<br>
generated by a throttle position sensor (TPS) 42. A throttle actuator adjusts the<br>
throttle position based on the throttle control signal. The throttle actuator can<br>
include a motor or a stepper motor, which provides limited and/or coarse control<br>
of the throttle position. The control module 40 also regulates the fuel injection<br>
system 20 and the cam shaft phasers 32, 34, as discussed in further detail<br>
below.<br>
[0035] An intake air temperature (IAT) sensor 44 is responsive to a<br>
temperature of the intake air flow and generates an intake air temperature signal.<br>
A mass airflow (MAF) sensor 46 is responsive to the mass of the intake air flow<br>
and generates a MAF signal. A manifold absolute pressure (MAP) sensor 48 is<br>
responsive to the pressure within the intake manifold 14 and generates a MAP<br>
signal. An engine coolant temperature sensor 50 is responsive to a coolant<br>
temperature and generates an engine temperature signal. An engine speed<br>
sensor 52 is responsive to a rotational speed of the engine 102 and generates in<br>
an engine speed signal. Each of the signals generated by the sensors is<br>
received by the control module 40.<br>
[0036] The control module 40 may control the timing and/or energy of<br>
the spark plug ignition. The timing may be advanced or retarded relative to the<br>
position of piston within the cylinder 18 and relative to the positions of the intake<br>
valve 22 and/or the exhaust valve 28. The control module 40 estimates VE to<br>
ensure correct cylinder air mass estimation for the engine. Cylinder air mass<br><br>
estimation is used to ensure correct air/fuel (A/F) ratio control, which may be<br>
used to meet emissions and driveability requirements. The engine control<br>
module adjusts at least one engine parameter based on the VE estimate. For<br>
example only, the engine control module calculates at least one of cylinder mass<br>
air flow, torque and an air/fuel ratio based on the VE estimate.<br>
[0037] The engine system 10 is merely exemplary in nature. For<br>
example only, the engine system 10 may include other sensors, forced induction<br>
using a turbocharger or supercharger, and/or other variations.<br>
[0038] The control module 40 estimates the VE using a combination of<br>
a table look-up and mathematical functions. The control module 40 estimates<br>
the VE using the following equations set forth below:<br>
VE(ICAM,ECAM,MAP,RPM) = VEparked(MAP,RPM)x<br>
fmult (IC AM, ECAM, MAP, RPM) + fadd (IC AM, EC AM, MAP, RPM)<br>
fmull(ICAM,ECAM,MAP,RPM) = 1 + a.ICAM + a2ECAM + a3ICAM*ECAM +<br>
a4ICAM2 +a5ECAM2 + a6ICAM*MAP + a7ECAM*MAP + a8MAP2*ICAM*ECAM +<br>
a9RPM*ICAM*ECAM + a10RPM2*ICAM*ECAM<br>
fadd(ICAM,ECAM,MAP,RPM) = b.ICAM + b2ECAM + b3ICAM*ECAM +<br>
b4ICAM2 +b5ECAM2 +b6ICAM*MAP + b7ECAM*MAP + b8RPM*ICAM +<br>
b,RPM*ECAM + b10RPM*MAP*ICAM*ECAM<br>
[0039] For example only, the table look-up (VEparked above) may be<br>
based on engine load (such as MAP) and engine speed (such as RPM). The<br>
table represents VE for the engine when the camshaft phasers are in the parked<br>
position.<br>
[0040] The mathematical function comprises a multiplicative term (fmult)<br>
and an additive term (fadd). Both terms may be a function of engine load (MAP),<br><br>
engine speed (RPM), intake cam position (ICAM), exhaust cam position (ECAM)<br>
and/or other parameters. Both functions may include calibration parameters (ax<br>
values for the multiplicative term and by values for the additive term).<br>
[0041] Referring now to FIG. 2, a method 100 is shown for estimating<br>
VE. In step 110, VEparked is estimated by accessing a lookup table based on at<br>
least one measured or estimated value. For example only, the lookup table may<br>
be accessed based on engine load and speed, such as MAP and/or RPM. In<br>
step 114, the multiplication factor fmult is calculated. In step 116, the addition<br>
factor fadd is calculated. In step 118, the final VE value is calculated based on the<br>
VEparked. fmult and fadd.<br>
[0042] The engine control module adjusts at least one engine<br>
parameter based on the VE estimate. For example only, the engine control<br>
module calculates at least one of cylinder mass air flow, torque and an air/fuel<br>
ratio based on the VE estimate. For example only, the control module 40 may<br>
use the estimated VE to calculate MAF, the A/F ratio and/or torque. The control<br>
module 40 adjusts fuel, spark, and/or other engine operating values to adjust the<br>
operation of the engine system 10.<br>
[0043] Referring now to FIG. 2A, the control module 40 may comprise<br>
a VE estimation module 140. The VE estimation module 140 may comprise a<br>
lookup table 150 that performs a lookup of VEparked. An addition factor calculating<br>
module 154 calculates fadd based on various input parameters. For example<br>
only, the input parameters may include MAP, RPM, ICAM and ECAM. A<br>
multiplication factor module 156 calculates fmult based on various input<br><br>
parameters. For example only, the input parameters may include MAP, RPM,<br>
ICAM and ECAM. A VE calculating module 158 calculates VE based on VEparked.<br>
fadd and fmult. The VE calculating module 158, the multiplication factor module<br>
156 and the addition factor module 154 may be collectively referred to as the<br>
calculating module 159.<br>
[0044] Referring now to FIG. 2B, the control module 40 may use the<br>
VE output by the VE estimation module 140 as an input to a cylinder MAF<br>
estimation module 164, which calculates MAFcyl based thereon and one or more<br>
other parameters. An air/fuel (A/F) estimation module 170 receives the MAFcyl<br>
and one or more other input parameters and calculates A/F ratio based thereon.<br>
[0045] Referring now to FIGs. 3-7, the VE maps have a response that<br>
is predominantly determined by the response when the cams are in the parked<br>
position. However, differences between the VE maps at non-parked cam<br>
positions and parked positions are non-trivial.<br>
[0046] In FIG. 3, an exemplary VE functional is shown for an internal<br>
combustion engine when both cams are in the parked positions. In FIG. 4, an<br>
exemplary VE function is shown for an internal combustion engine when the<br>
intake cam is fully advanced and the exhaust cam is in a parked position. In FIG.<br>
5, an exemplary VE function is shown for an internal combustion engine when<br>
the intake cam is parked and the exhaust cam is fully retarded.<br>
[0047] In FIG. 6, a difference is shown between a typical VE function<br>
when the intake cam is fully advanced and the exhaust cam is parked and a<br>
typical VE function when both cams are parked. In FIG. 7, a difference is shown<br><br>
between a typical VE function when the exhaust cam is fully retarded and the<br>
intake cam is parked and a VE function when both cams are parked.<br>
[0048] In FIG. 8, a histogram of errors between actual and modeled VE<br>
values is shown. Coefficients for the model may be selected to minimize the<br>
difference between actual and modeled VE.<br>
[0049] Exemplary advantages of the systems and methods according<br>
to the present disclosure include increased accuracy over current VE<br>
representations and less calibration effort. The approach also reduces storage<br>
and/or processing power requirements. The present disclosure can be readily<br>
implemented in the control module.<br><br>
