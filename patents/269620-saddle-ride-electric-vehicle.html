DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
[0049]	First, in FIGS. 1 to 4, a vehicle body frame FA of a motorcycle, which is a<br>
saddle-ride electric vehicle, includes a head pipe 13 steerably supporting a front fork 11 with<br>
a front wheel WF joumaled to a lower end portion and a bar-shaped steering handlebar 12<br>
connected to the upper portion of tiie front fork 11, a pipe-shaped main frame 14 extending<br>
downward and rearward from the head pipe 13, a pivot frame 16 connected to the rear end<br>
portion of the main fi^me 14 and extending downward, a pair of left and right rear frames 17<br>
connected to the rear end portion of the main frame 14 and extending rearward, and a pair of<br>
left and right seat rails 18 disposed between the rear portion of the main frame 14 and the<br>
middle portions of both rear frames 17 and inclined upward and rearward.<br>
[0050]	The rear frames 17 each have inclined portions 17a extending upward and<br>
rearward from the rear end portion of the main frame 14 and horizontal portions 17b extending horizontally rearward from the rear ends of the inclined portions 17a, which are integrally formed, and the rear portions of the horizontal portions 17b are connected to each<br><br><br>
other. Further, the rear ends of the seat rails 18 are connected to the rear upper portions of the inclined portions 17a of the rear frames 17.<br>
[0051]	A front fender 20 that covers the front wheel WF from above is attached to<br>
the front fork 11 and a rear fender 21 that covers the rear wheel WR from above is attached to<br>
the real' frames 17. Further, a main stand 22 is rotatably attached to the lower portion of the<br>
pivot frame 16. In addition, the front end portion of a swing arm 23 with the rear wheel WR<br>
joumaled to the rear end portion is connected swingably up/down to the pivot frame 16 and<br>
rear cushion units 24 are disposed between the front portions of the horizontal portions 17b of<br>
the rear fi-ames 17 and tlie rear portion of the swing arm 23. Furthermore, a load-carrying<br>
platform 25 is disposed on the horizontal portions 17b of the rear fi^ames 17.<br>
[0052]	An occupant seat 28 is disposed ahead of the load-carrying platform 25 and<br>
supported to the seat rails 18 through a seat support frame 19, such that, as shown in FIG. 5, the occupant seat 28 is supported rotatably forward by the seat support frame 19. Thus, the seat support frame 19 has a horizontal seat support portion 19a supporting the occupant seat 28, a front leg 19b extending downward from the fi"ont portion of the seat support portion 19a, and a rear leg 19c extending downward from the rear portion of the seat support portion 19a, in wliich the lower end of the front leg 19b is fixed to the front portions of the seat rails 18 and the lower end of the rear leg 19c is fixed to the rear portion of the inclined portions 17a of the rear iiames 17.<br>
[0053]	On the other hand, the rear wheel WR is rotatively driven by the power<br>
generated by the electric motor 29 and a main battery 30 supplying electric power to the electric motor 29 is disposed in a first space SI (see FIGS. 1 and 3) which is surrounded by the main frame 14, a down frame 15 that forms a portion of the vehicle body frame FA and is connected to the head pipe 13 or the front end portion of the main frame 14 (the front end portion of the main frame 14 in this embodiment) while extending downward, and the pivot frame 16.   On the other hand, tlie electric motor 29 is disposed at a position different from<br><br>
the first space SI, and in this embodiment, tlie electnc motor 29 is disposed, with tlae rotational axis arranged coaxially with the rear wheel WR, at the rear end portion of the swing arm 23 behind the first space SI.<br>
[0054]	Tlie main battery 30 is composed of a plurality of cells 31 for a main battery,<br>
which is combined with each other, and each of the cells 31 for a main battery has an upper surface substantially corresponding to tlie main frame 14 of the vehicle body frame FA and the cells are aligningly arranged in a main battery box 32 disposed in the first space SI surrounded by the main frame 14, thie down frame 15, and the pivot frame 16, corresponding to the shape of the main batteiy box 32.<br>
[0055]	Thus, the upper surface of the main battery box 32 is foimed to correspond to<br>
the lower surface of the main frame 14 extending downward and rearward, and in this embodiment, is formed to be gradually lowered to the rear.<br>
[0056]	In addition, a lower frame 33, which is selectable between a connection state<br>
that supports the main battery box 32 by connecting the down frame 15 with the pivot frame 16 and a disconnection state that allows the main battery box 32 to be drawn out downward by cutting the connection, is dispos(jd between the lower portions of the down frame 15 and the pivot frame 16. In this embodiment, the rear portion of the lower frame 33 is swingably connected to the lower portion of the pivot frame 16 through a spindle 34 and the front portion of the lower frame 33 is detachably connected to the lower portion of the down frame 15 by a detachable connecting pin 35 or the like. That is, the lower frame 33 which is selectable between the connection state where the front portion of the lower frame is connected to the down frame 15 and the disconnection state where the front portion of the front frame is separated from the down frame 15, such that it is possible to draw out downward the main battery box 32 by rotating down the front portion of the lower frame 33 in the disconnection state, as shown in FIG. 5.<br><br><br>
[0057]	Further, elastic members 36 are interposed between the upper surface of the<br>
main batteiy box 32 supported by the lower frame 33, which is in the connection state, and the vehicle body frame FA.<br>
[0058]	Further, a pair of left and right step-frames 37 that extends forward from the<br>
pivot frame 16 is connected to the lower portion of the pivot frame 16, and steps 38 where an occupant sitting on the occupant seat 28 puts the feet are provided at the front ends of the step-frames 37.<br>
[0059]	Thus, the main battery box 32 accommodating the main battery 30 does not<br>
overlap the step-frames 37 and steps 38 in a plane view, as shown in FIGS. 2 and 4, and in this embodiment, the rear width of the main battery box 32, that is, the main battery 30 is set to be narrower than the width of front portion of the main battery box 32, corresponding to the step-frames 37 and the steps 38 disposed at both rear sides of the main battery box 32. In addition, in order to increase the capacity of the main battery 30, the main battery box 32 is formed to extend rearward such that the rear end portion overlaps the step-frames 37 in a side view.<br>
[0060]	Further, a sub-battery 40 that can supply electric power to the electric motor<br>
29, instead of the main battery 30, is disposed in a second space S2 surrounded by the main frame 14 and the seat rails 18 and positioned under the occupant seat 28 such that it can be drawn out of the second space S2 with the occupant seat 28 rotated forward, as shown in FIG. 5, and the sub-battery 40 is surrounded by the seat support frame 19. Thus, the electric motor 29, unlike the first space SI, is disposed behind the first space SI and positioned at the rear end portion of the swing arm 23, such that it is disposed at a different position fi-om the second space S2.<br>
[0061]	The sub-battery 40 is composed of a plurality of cells 41 for a sub-battery,<br>
which is combined with each other, and the cells 41 for a sub-battery are formed to<br><br><br>

battery 40 that can supply electric power to the electric motor 29 instead of the main battery 30 is disposed in the second space S2, which is surrounded by the rear frames 17 connected to the rear end portion of the main frame 14 and extending upward and rearward, the seat<br><br><br>
rails 18 supporting the occupant seat 28 while connecting tlie rear portion of the main frame 14 with tlie middle portions of tlie rear frames 17, and tlie main frame 14, and tlie electric motor 29 is disposed at a position different from the second space S2. Accordingly, by disposing tlie main battery 30 and the sub-battery 40 in the first and second spaces SI, S2, which can be formed larger by not disposing the electric motor 29, it is possible to dispose a larger main battery 30 and sub-battery 40 and supply electric power to the electric motor 29 from the sub-batteiy 40 instead of the main battery 30, when the main battery 30 is discharged.<br>
[0071]	nie main battery 30 is composed of the plurality of cells 31 for a main battery,<br>
wliich is combined with each other, tlie cells 31 for a main battery have upper surfaces substantially corresponding to the lower surface of the main frame 14 and are arranged in a main battery box 32 disposed in ttie first space SI surrounded by the main frame 14, the down frame 15, and the pivot frame 16, corresponding to the shape of the main battery box 32, the sub-battery 40 is composed of the plurality of cells 41 for a sub-battery, which is combined with each other, and the cells 41 for a sub-battery are formed to correspond to the second space S2 and aligningly arranged in a sub-battery box 42 disposed in the second space S2, corresponding to the shape of the sub-battery box 42. Accordingly, it is possible to accommodate more cells 31 for a main battery in the main battery box 32 and accommodate more cells 41 for a sub-battery in the sub-battery box 42.<br>
[0072]	Further, the side covers 47 covering the seat rails 18 from the sides are<br>
disposed under the occupant seat 28 disposed above the seat rails 18 and the driving circuit means 49 receiving electric power supplied from the main battery 30 or the sub-battery 40 and driving the electric motor 29 is accommodated in the side cover 47. Accordingly, the driving circuit means 49 is not seen from the outside and the external appearance can be improved.<br><br><br>
[0073]	In addition, the pair of left and right side covers 47 is disposed at both the left<br>
and riglit sides of the seat rails 18, tlie driving circuit means 49 is accommodated in one of the side covers 47, and the charging circuit means 50 for charging the main battery 30 is accommodated in the other one of both side covers 47. Accordingly, it is possible to dispose the driving circuit means 49 and the charging circuit means 50 while maintaining good left-right weight balance, effectively using the space inside both side covers 47, and achieving good extemal appearance.<br>
[0074]	Further, the first cooling fan 43 that sucks air heated by tlie main battery 30 to<br>

are disposed inside in the width direction of the occupant seat 28 when seen from above, it is<br>
possible to dispose the driving circuit means 49 and the charging circuit means 50 without<br>
interfering with the feet of the occupant striding across the occupant seat 28, and the driving<br>
circuit means 49 and the charging circuit means 50 can be protected by the occupant seat 28.<br>
Since the driving circuit means 49 and the charging circuit means 50 are disposed in the<br>
space surrounded by the main fran:Le 14, the occupant seat 28, and the rear frames 17, it is<br>
possible to protect the driving circuit means 49 and the charging circuit means 50 by<br>
surrounding them with the main frame 14, the occupant seat 28, and the rear frames 17.<br>
[0076]	In addition, since the main battery box 32 is formed such that traveling air<br>
coming from the front area of the motorcycle can be infroduced from the front and discharged from the rear upper portion and the main battery 30 is accommodated in the main battery box<br><br>
32, it is possible to effectively discharge the air in the main battery box 32 and effectively<br>

Accordingly, it is possible to discharge the heat generated by the sub-battery 40 rearward of the occupant seat 28.<br>
[0078]	Further, since the main battery 30 and the main battery box 32 are disposed in<br>
the first space SI without overlapping both step-frames 37 and the steps 38 disposed at the front ends of both step-frames 37 in a plane view, it is possible for the occupant to more comfortably put the feet without increasing the width between both step-frames 37. Furthermore, by disposing both step-frames 37 and both steps 38, although the width of the main battery 30 has to be decreased where the occupant strides across the occupant seat 28, the width of the main battery 30 is increased at the portion positioned further forward from both step-frames 37 and both steps 38. Accordingly, it is possible for the occupant to more comfortably put the feet, to considerably increase the capacity of the main battery box 32, and to increase the size of the main battery 30 by accommodating more cells 31 for a main battery in the main battery box 32.<br>

[0093]	Thus, both lower irames 33 are connected by a supporting plate 36 on which<br>
the main battery box 32 is mounted, and in the disconnection state of both lower frames 33,<br><br>
as shown in FIG. 4, the lower frames 33 can be rotated such that the front portions move down.<br>
[0094]	In addition, the down frames 15 are composed of upper-down frames 15a of<br>
which the upper end portions are connected to the front end portion of the main frame 14 and<br>
lower-down frames 15b of which the upper end portions are connected to the lower end<br>
portions of the upper-down frames 15a. The lower-down frames 15b can be selectable<br>
between a position extending downward from the upper-down frames 15a such that the front<br>
ends of the lower frames 33 are connected to the lower portions of the lower-down frames<br>
15b by connecting pins 35 and a position rotating forward with the lower portions of the<br>
lower-down frames 15b disconnected from the front ends of the lower frames 33, and are<br>
rotatably connected to the lower end portions of the upper-down frames 15a through pins 26.<br>

main battery 30 is set to be narrower than the width of the front portion of the main batteiy box 32.<br>
[00101]	Further, in a second space S2 sun-ounded by the main frame 14 and the seat<br>
rails 18 under the occupant seat 28, a sub-battery 40, which can supply electric power to the electric motor 29 instead of the main battery 30, is disposed to be removed from the second space S2, with the occupant seat 28 rotated forward.

main battery 30 supplying electric power to the electric motor 29 generating power for<br>
rotatively driving the rear wheel WR. is disposed in the first space S1 surrounded by the down<br>
frame 15 connected to the front end portion of the main frame 14 and extending downward,<br>
the pivot frame 16 connected to the rear end portion of the main frame 14 and extending<br>
downward, and the main frame 14, and the electric motor 29 is disposed at a position<br>
different from the first space SI, it is possible to dispose the large main battery 30 by<br>
increasing the first space SI to dispose tlie main battery 30 in the increased first space SI.<br>
[00105]	Further, since at least a portion of the upper end of the main battery 30<br>
overlaps the main frame 14 when seen from a side, it is possible to increase the size by extending upward the main battery 30.<br>
[00106]	Further, since the front end portion of the swing arm 23 with the rear wheel<br>
WR joumaled to the rear end portion is cormected swingably up/down to the pivot arm 16 and the electric motor 29 is disposed with the rotational axis arranged coaxially with the rear wheel WR at the rear end portion of the swing arm 23, it is possible to compactly dispose the electric motor 29 while ensuring an installation space for the main battery 30.<br><br><br>

14 with the middle portions of tlie rear frames 17, and the main frame 14, and the electric<br>
motor 29 is not disposed in the second space S2. Accordingly, by disposing the main<br>
battery 30 and the sub-batteiy 40 in the first and second spaces SI, S2, which can be formed<br>
larger by not disposing the electric motor 29, it is possible to dispose a larger main battery 30<br>
and sub-battery 40 and supply electiic power to the electric motor 29 from the sub-battery 40<br>
instead of the main battery 30, when the main battery 30 is discharged.<br>
[00108]	The main battery 30 is composed of the plurahty of cells 31 for a main battery,<br>
which is combined with each other, the cells 31 for a main battery have upper surfaces substantially corresponding to the lower surface of the main frame 14 and are aligningly arranged in a main battery box 32 disposed in the first space SI surrounded by the main frame 14, the down frames 15, and the pivot frames 16, corresponding to the shape of the main battery box 32. Accordingly, it is possible to accommodate more cells 31 for a main battery in the main battery box 32.<br>
[00109]	Further, the side covers 47 covering the seat rails 18 from the sides are<br>
disposed under the occupant seat 28 disposed above the seat rails 18 and the driving circuit means 49 receiving electric power supplied from the main battery 30 or the sub-battery 40 and driving the electric motor 29 is accommodated in the side cover 47. Accordingly, the driving circuit means 49 is not seen from the outside and the extemal appearance can be improved.<br>
[00110]	In addition, the pair of left and right side covers 47 is disposed at both the left<br>
and right sides of the seat rails 18, the driving circuit means 49 is accommodated in one of the<br><br><br>
side covers 47, and the charging ciixuit means 50 for charging the main battery 30 is accommodated in the otlier one of both side covers 47. Accordingly, it is possible to dispose the driving circuit means 49 and the chaiging circuit means 50 while maintaining good left-right weight balance, effectively using the space inside both side covers 47, and achieving good external appearance.<br>
[00111]	Further, since the lower frame 33, which is selectable between a connection<br>
state that supports the main battery box 32 by connecting the down frame 15 witli the pivot frame 16 and a disconnection state that allows tlie main battery box 32 to be drawn out downward by cutting the connection, is disposed between the lower portions of the down frame 15 and the pivot frame 16, in the disconnection state of the lower fi-ame 33, it is possible to draw out the main battery box 32 downward and maintenance of the main battery 30 is facilitated.<br>
[00112]	In addition, the down frames 15 are composed of the upper-down fimnes 15a<br>
of which the upper end portions are connected to the front end portion of the main frame 14<br>
and the lower-down frames 15b of which the upper end portions are connected to the lower<br>
end portions of the upper-down frames 15 a. The lower-down frames 15b can be selectable<br>
between a position extending downward from the upper-down frames 15a such that the front<br>
ends of the lower frames 33 are connected to the lower portions of the lower-down frames<br>
15b by the connecting pins 35 and a position rotating forward with the lower portion of the<br>
lower-down frames 15b disconnected from the front ends of tlie lower frames 33, and are<br>
rotatably connected to the lower end portions of the upper-down frames 15a through the pins<br>
26. Accordingly, in the disconnection state of the lower frames 33, by rotating forward the<br>
lower-down frames 15b of the down frames 15, the battery box 32 can be drawn out<br>
obliquely downward forward, such Ihat it is possible to easily draw out the battery box 32.<br>
[00113]	Further, since at least portions of the lower frames 33 disposed inside from<br>
both sides in the width direction of the main battery box 32 overlap the lower portion of the<br><br><br>
main battery box 32 in the connection state of the lower frames 33 when seen from a side, it is prevented that the vehicle width is increased by disposing the lower frames 33 and the minimum height from the ground can be ensured. It is possible to compensate the amount of volume reduced by fomiing the recessed portions 32a at both lower sides of the batteiy box 32 to accommodate the lower frames 33 that are in the connection state, by extending upward the main battery 30 such that at least a portion of the upper end of the main battery 30 overlaps the main frame 14 when seen from a side.<br>
[00114]	Further, since die steps 38 disposed at botli sides of the main battery 30 and<br>
the main battery box 32 when seen from above are provided at the front ends of the pair of<br>
left and right step-frames 37 overlapped by the rear portions of the main battery 30 and the<br>
main battery box 32 when seen from above, it is possible for the occupant to more<br>
comfortably place the feet without increasing the width between both step-frames 37.<br>
[00115]	Further, by disposing both steps 3 8, although the width of the main battery 30<br>
has to be decreased where the occupant strides across on the occupant seat 28, the width of the main battery 30 is increased at the portion positioned further forward from botli step-frames 37 and both steps 38. Accordingly, it is possible for the occupant to more comfortably place the feet, to considerably increase the capacity of the main battery box 32, and to increases the size of the main battery 30 by accommodating more cells 31 for a main battery in the main battery box 32.<br>
[00116]	Furthermore, since tlie bottom 41B of the battery 30 is formed to be stepped<br>
downward to the front portion, haviiig a rear bottom 41a positioned above the step-frames 37 when seen from a side and a front bottom 41b positioned below the step-frames 38, it is possible to prevent the size of the main battery 30 from decreasing, while preventing the width between both step-frames 38 from increasing.<br><br>
