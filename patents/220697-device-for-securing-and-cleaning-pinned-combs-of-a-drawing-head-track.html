				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a device for securing and cleaning pinned combs of a track of a drawing-head.<br>
The present invention relates to the field of textile machines, in particular chain-mounted gill boxes and more particularly drawing-head tracks and its object is a novel device for securing and cleaning pinned combs of a drawing-head track.<br>
Currently, chain-mounted gill boxes, either horizontal or vertical, are composed of at least one drawing-head made up of two tracks positioned opposite one another, above one another or in front of one another, and placed between a pair of feed rollers and an assembly of drawing rollers.<br>
The textile material passes successively between the feed rollers, then between the tracks and subsequently between (lie drawing rollers. Each track comprises an assembly of pinned combs equipped with intersecting pins and arranged such that in the work zone located between the feed rollers and the drawing rollers, the textile material is displaced, controlled and retained by said pins before being caught by the drawing rollers, hi the vicinity of the drawing rollers, the pinned combs release the textile material by moving away from the work zone. Thus, in the work zone, the pinned combs are displaced in the direction of displacement of the textile material, i.e. from the feed rollers toward the drawing rollers.<br>
The angle of the pinned comb, when it moves out of the work zone, is such that the pins relinquish the textile material without carrying it along. Said angle of the pinned comb is obtained by means of the bent form of one end of the body of the pinned comb which co-operates with a cam path of particular form.<br>
The pinned combs are integral with two endless elements, such as triple chains each placed in the vicinity of the ends of the bodies of the pinned comb. Each triple chain is moved by an assembly of three juxtaposed sprockets, of which the teeth mesh with the rollers of the links of the three chains forming each triple chain. Each triple chain is tensioned by means of an idler sprocket and is guided<br><br>
along its path defining (he work zone, by guide chains, on which the rollers of the chain links may freely roll<br>
Alter having left the work zone the pinned combs move away following a path which is substantially rectilinear and perpendicular to the path of the textile material. On said removal path, the pinned combs are inclined such that the bodies of the pinned combs almost abut and such that the pins of two consecutive pinned combs are almost parallel to one another. Thus it becomes possible to obtain a maximum reduction in the distance separating the drawing rollers from the pins of the work zone Said distance, which has to be the shortest possible, directly dictates the capacity for controlling the shortest fibres.<br>
The pinned combs are currently cleaned, on the one hand, by means of a fixed brush placed on the removal path of each of the tracks and, on the other hand, by a cylindrical brush located along the return path. In fact, by continuing their displacement, the pinned combs are brought back in a direction counter to the displacement of the textile material. On said path, the angle of the pinned combs does not have a functional importance, nor moreover the form of the path of the pinned combs. Also, idling sprockets are placed along said return path of which the function is to exert a constant tension on the chains and to compensate lor their lengthening due to the wear of the elements which make up the chains.<br>
Thus, the return path is different depending on the degree of wear of the chains. A cylindrical brush is also placed along said return path, of which the rotating axle is fixed relative to the drawing-head and which is driven positively in rotation. The role of this brush is to perfect the cleaning of the pinned combs and to detect winding of textile material around the track by means of sensors. The fibres and other impurities which the cylindrical brush removes from the pinned combs are partly suctioned by means of pneumatic collectors.<br>
The known devices for cleaning pinned combs which generally comprise two means lor cleaning have the disadvantage of creating a significant accumulation<br>
of fibres and impurities in the region of the fixed brush of the track. The size of this deposit of fibres and impurities increases to the point where it may no longer be possible lor said deposit to be held by the fixed brush and is either driven by the pinned combs and then taken up again by the cylindrical brush, or suclionecl by a pneumatic collector positioned nearby.<br>
In order to avoid this type of incident it is frequently advisable to stop the machine, to remove the fixed brush and to clean it. A consequence of said operation is a significant reduction in the output of the machine and an increase in the labour requirement.<br>
An attempt has been made to solve this problem in FR-A-2 794 138, by providing a cleaning brush which turns intermittently through a predetermined angular value which, in particular, means that the brush is intermittently immobilised in rotation This document, however, does not in any way disclose a security device which might be composed of a brush, of which the position is modified following winding of textile material around a track. Also, in the event of such an incident, the cylindrical brush, according to FR-A-2 794 138 which does not allow winding to be detected is violently extracted from its support and projected by the moving pinned combs, which lias the result that significant mechanical damage occurs.<br>
In EP-A-66 437, a cleaning brush is known which is positioned at an angle, i.e. at the end of the vertical portion of the path of the pinned combs and of which the position cannot be modified in the event of textile material winding around a track Said brush is not a security device and thus, in the event of winding, the brush is also expelled from its support by the moving pinned combs which leads to considerable mechanical damage.<br>
The object of the present invention is to remedy these disadvantages by proposing a device lor securing and cleaning pinned combs of a drawing-head track.<br><br>
To this end, said device is characterised in that it comprises a rotatable cylindrical brush and of which the position relative to the drawing-head is modified following winding of textile arterial around a track.<br>
The invention will be better understood by means of the following description which refers to preferred embodiments, given by way of non-limiting examples and explained with reference to the accompanying diagrammatic drawings, in which:<br>
Fig. 1 is a side elevation and sectional view of the two drawing-head tracks of a chain-mounted gill box, equipped with a securing and cleaning device according to the invention,<br>
Fig. 2 is a similar view to that of Fig I showing a particular embodiment of the securing and cleaning device and<br>
Figs. 3ato3h are partial sectional views showing different variants of the securing and cleaning device.<br>
Figs. 1 and 2 of the accompanying drawings show, by way of example, a chain-mounted gill box which is composed of a drawing-head I made up of two tracks 2a, 2b, each equipped with pinned combs 5 equipped with pins and located one above the other and placed between a pair of feed rollers 3a, 3b and of an assembly of drawing rollers 4a, 4b and 4c.<br>
Said pinned combs 5 are cleaned by means of  a securing and cleaning device according to the invention which comprises a rotatable cylindrical brush 13 and of which the position relative to the drawing-head 1 is modified following winding of textile material around a track 2a, 2b. In the known manner and in order to clean the pins of the pinned combs 5 efficiently, the direction of rotation of the cylindrical brush 13 is counter to the direction of displacement of said pinned combs 5<br>
According to a feature of the invention, in the functioning position, the cylindrical brush 13 is arranged on the removal path B, C preferably closest to the drawing rollers 4a, 4b, 4c. The positioning of the brush 13 can be modified relative to the drawing-head I, successively into the position for cleaning the pinned combs, then into the position of release. Thus, the brush 13 may be removed from the drawing rollers 4a to 4c. in order to facilitate the dismantling of the pressing roller 4c.<br>
According to a further feature of the invention, the device is provided with a sensor 14 for detecting the position of the brush 13 relative to the drawing-head 1, said sensor causing the machine to stop in the event of the brush 13 moving away, following winding of textile material around a track 2a, 2b.<br>
According to an embodiment of the invention, shown in the accompanying Figs I, 2, 3a, 3b, 3d to 3h, the rotating axle 15 of the cylindrical brush 13 may be mounted on a lever 16 pivoting about an axle 17 fixed relative to the frame of the machine and integral therewith. The fixed axle 17 is preferably integral with the track 2a, 2b.<br>
According to a variant of the invention, shown in Fig. 3a of the accompanying drawings the fixed axle 17 may also be integral with the cover of the machine.<br>
According to a further embodiment of the invention, the fixed axle 17 of the lever 16 for supporting the cylindrical brush 13 may also be integral with the axle of a roller 4a, 4b, 4c of the set of drawing rollers (Figs. 3b, 3f 3g).<br>
It is also possible, as Fig. 3c shows, to mount the cylindrical brush 13 by means of its rotating axle 15 on a rectilinear or curvilinear guide slide 18, said slide 18 being integral with the cover of the machine, and the positioning of the brush 13 into the position for cleaning the pinned combs is provided by means of a compression spring assembly 18, acting on the axle 15 in the direction of the pinned combs 5 Thus, the cylindrical brush 13 is displaced along a path in the<br><br>
direction of the pinned combs 5 and is held by its bristles pressed against said pinned combs 5. The position of release is obtained by lifting the cover of the machine<br>
The cylindrical brush 13 is, preferably, pressed by gravity against the pinned combs 5 of the track 2a, 2b. In a variant, a pressing means 19 may be provided such as a spring or a power cylinder which provides the contact between the bristles of the cylindrical brush 13 and the pinned combs 5.<br>
The lever lo, which may have the form ol a moving bearing, may occupy two extreme positions, of which one is said lo be a position Ibr cleaning the pinned combs 5 and the other, shown in dolled lines in Fig. 2, said to be a position of release.<br>
According to a further feature of the invention, the lever 16 may co-operate, in the position of release, with a resilient catch provided on the frame of the machine, such as a ball forced by a spring lo penetrate a corresponding indentation of said lever 16 Thus, the brush 13 is held in the position removed (torn the drawing rollers 4a to 4c.<br>
The cylindrical brush 13 is mounted on an axle 15 of which the lateral ends are conical and provided with a rotating drive means such as a pin. At each of its ends, the axle 15 is held lightly and centred by its conical bearings between two supports, of which one is equipped with a compression spring designed to exert an axial force in the direction of the support located opposite. Said support is equipped with a rotating drive means of the axle of the brush such as a groove (nol shown ) designed lo co-operate with the pin placed in the axle of the brush.<br>
According to an embodiment of  the invention shown in Figs. 2 and 3e to 3h of the accompanying drawings, the cylindrical brush 13 may be provided on an axle 15, at one of its ends, with a rotating sprocket or a driving pulley 22 integral with said axle 15 by means of  a slotted support (not shown). Said assembly allows the<br><br>
cylindrical brush 13 to be perfectly centred, held and driven in rotation and for it to be easily disassembled, by manually forcing the supports to separate Ironi one another.<br>
In the position for cleaning the pinned combs 5 of (he track 2a, 2b the cylindrical brush 13 is brought into contact with said pinned combs 5 by gravity and cleans them due to the relative difference in speed of displacement of the bristles of the brush 13 relative to the pinned combs 5.<br>
According to a feature of the invention, the sprocket or pulley 22 of the cylindrical brush 13 is driven by means of a sprocket 20 placed on the track 2a, 2b and cooperating, by means of a bell 26 and a sprocket 25 mounted on the pivot axle 17 of the moving bearing or lever 16, with a series of sprockets 22, 23, 24 causing the cylindrical brush 13 to rotate in the direction opposing the displacement of the pinned combs 5 (Fig. 2), the axle 17 carrying, furthermore, one of the sprockets 24 of the series of sprockets and a lensioner 27 providing constant tension of the belt 26.<br>
In said embodiment the rotating axle of the baish 13 coincides with that of the sprocket 22 and the axle of the sprocket 24 coincides with the pivot axle 17 of the moving bearing or lever 16. An intermediate sprocket 23 may be inserted between the sprockets 22 and 24, in order to reverse the direction of rotation of the brush 13.<br>
It is also possible for the sprocket 20 placed on the track 2a, 2b to co-operate with an assembly of notched sprockets and belts (not shown) or even with an assembly of pulleys and smooth belts (Fig. 3h). In said case, the rotating kinematic drive chain of the cylindrical brush 13 allows slight slippage. To this end, the cylindrical brush 13 is rotated by means of a bell receiving its movement from a pulley or a notched sprocket 20, said bell circulating between two guide wheels, placed symmetrically on both sides of the pivot point of the moving bearing 16.<br><br>
The transmission ratio of the kinematics drive chain of the cylindrical brush 13 is such that, on the one hand, the rotational direction of the brush 13 is counter to the direction of displacement of the pinned combs 5 and, on the other hand, such that there is a relative difference in speed between the bristles of said brush 13 and the pinned combs 5 which it is assigned to clean. Thus, the brush 13 removes the impurities transported by the pinned combs 5 and conveys them to a pneumatic collector 12 which carries them toward the filter box of the machine.<br>
Preferably, said transmission ratio is such that the peripheral rotational speed of the end of the bristles of the cylindrical baish 13 is lower than the linear speed of displacement of the pinned combs 5.<br>
The assembly of the pivoting device made up of the brush 13 of the moving bearing(s) or lever(s) lt&gt; and by the rotating drive sprockets 22, 23, 24, 25 of the brush is pressed by gravity on an abutment 28 of the track 2 a, 2b. To this end, the rotating axle 15 of the brush 13 is situated in a vertical plane which is different from that of the pivot axle 17 of the moving bearing 16 such that the pivoting device as a whole exerts an opposing moment on the abutment 28.<br>
According to a variant of the invention, the contact between the bristles of the cylindrical brush 13 and the pinned combs 5 is provided by a pressing means 19 such as a spring or a power cylinder.<br>
According to a variant of the invention, the cylindrical brush 13 may also be driven directly by an electric or pneumatic motor. As Fig. 3d of the accompanying drawings shows diagrammatically, said motor may be placed in the interior of the body of the cylindrical brush 13.<br>
Fig 3e shows a further variant of the invention, in which the rotational drive of the cylindrical brush 13 is provided by the movement of the pinned combs 5 themselves, an additional means, such as a mechanical, electrical or pneumatic brake slowing the rotational speed of the brush 13, in order to create a difference<br>
ill speed between the pinned combs 5 and the brush 13, to allow the pinned combs 5 to be brushed.<br>
In a further variant of the invention shown in Fig. 31" of the accompanying drawings, the cylindrical brush 13 is driven in rotation by the drawing rollers 4a, 4b or 4c by means of a belt 21 which drives the cylindrical brush 13 in rotation starting from the pressing roller 4c of said drawing rollers.<br>
It is also possible, as Fig. 3g shows, Ibr the cylindrical brush 13 to be driven in rotation by the drawing rollers 4a, 4b or 4c, by means of a series of sprockets acting on the cylindrical brush 13 and co-operating with said drawing rollers.<br>
The sensor 14, integral with the track 2a, 2b, is a position sensor Ibr the moving bearing 16 relative to the abutment 28 which detects the movement of the moving bearing 16 and causes the machine to stop when the moving bearing 16 is separated from the abutment 28. Thus, in the event of an incident due to winding of textile material around a track 2a, 2b, the pinned combs 5 carry the textile material therewith along their removal path B, C and the brush 13, assigned to clean the pinned combs 5, removes the textile material from the pinned combs 5 by winding it onto itself around the brush 13, which has the effect of increasing the visible external diameter of the cylindrical brush 13. This increase of the diameter ol the brush causes said brush to move away from the pinned combs 5 and a pivoting of the moving bearing or lever 16, which is detected by the sensor 14 which controls the slopping of the machine.<br>
By means of the invention, it is possible to reduce the frequency with which windings are formed, to delect when the brush is excessively clogged, to avoid mechanical damage following winding of textile material around a track and to keep the pinned combs clean. Furthermore, the invention allows an increase in the cleaning intervals of the brushes and, consequently, improves the output of the machine and reduces the labour requirement. Moreover, the invention allows the removal of the brush placed on the return path of the pinned combs.<br>
When the machine is stopped, the moving bearing 16 may be displaced, either manually by means of a handle 29 or automatically by means of an actuator not shown in the accompanying drawings, so as to bring it into the position of release shown in dolled lines on Fig, 2.<br>
The moving bearing 16 is held in said position of release by means of a resilient catch integral with the moving bearing 16 and made up of, for example, a ball forced by a spring to penetrate an indentation made in the track 2a, 2b. In this stable position of release, the securing and cleaning device allows free access to the mechanical members of the machine, in particular to the cylindrical brush 13 itself and to the pressing roller 4c, so as to allow said members of the machine to be easily disassembled.<br>
Naturally, (lie invention is not limited to the embodiments disclosed and shown in the accompanying, drawings. Modilications remain possible, in particular from the point of view of the composition of the various elements or by the substitution of technical equivalents, without departing from the scope of protection of the invention.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
