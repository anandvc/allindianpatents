				<td>Field of the invention<br><br>
The present invention relates to an analog digital alternative and augmentative communicationdevice useful for individuals with multiple disabilities<br><br>
The use of the electronic medium as a learning tool or as a communication device is prevalent today. However, people with poor mobility are unable to effectively operate computers and embedded devices because they cannot operate the keypad, mouse or other peripheral devices that are used to input or select information into the electronic medium. The development of devices that respond to movement and thereby facilitate the use of the electronic medium will greatly enhance the quality of life of individuals who otherwise have very limited access to the electronic world. Accordingly, the analog digital alternative and augmentative communication device of the present invention would be useful for individuals with Multiple Disabilities<br><br>
Background<br><br>
Approximately 15 million individuals in India suffer from a variety of motor disorders. A majority of this population has cerebral palsy and about half this segment is non-speaking. Also known as CP, Cerebral Palsy describes a group of disorders that impair muscle co-ordination and motor movements. A CP child is not mentally retarded, paralyzed or completely incapacitated. Separate parts of the brain control motor movements and intelligence. In CP, the motor cortex is damaged or not developed fully. Hence the child's intelligence is not affected and the child will have average thinking and learning powers. Since their brain is not able to control healthy muscles for motor coordination, these children need special skills and individual care, both at home and in schools to help them in life.<br><br>
Prior art<br><br>
The Theremin Vox<br><br>
The Theremin Vox is one of the earliest fully electronic musical instruments. It was invented by Russian Leon Theremin in 1919, and it is unique in that it was the first musical instrument designed to be played without being touched. The instrument functions on the principle of heterodyning. For performing the principle of heterodyning, a device as shown in Fig. 1 of the drawing accompanying this specification is employed.<br><br>
The device comprises a metal antenna (1) which acts as one plate of a capacitive element, the other plate of the capacitive element being capable of connected to the neutral, or zero voltage, the output of the antenna (1) being connected to the input of a variable frequency oscillator (2), the output of the variable frequency oscillator being connected to one of the inputs of the mixer (3), the other input of the mixer (3) being connected to local oscillator (4), the third input of the mixer (3) being connected to a Low pass filter (5) and the output of the low pass filter (5) being connected to an audio amplifier (6)<br><br>
The operation of the above device is described below. Both the variable frequency oscillator(2) and the local oscillator (4) rely on passive electrical circuits comprising of resistors, capacitors or inductors to generate oscillating electrical signals. We shall refer to the resistors, capacitors or inductors by the general term impedance or impedance elements. For a fixed resistance, the frequency of the oscillating signal is determined by the impedance in the electrical circuit. When the distance of the user's body from the metal antenna(l) remains unchanged, typically at a distance of about 6 inches, the variable frequency oscillator (2) generates a frequency f1. As the distance between the user's body and the antenna (1) varies, so does the impedance between the antenna (1) and the circuit's neutral, or ground, and this causes the variable oscillator frequency (2) to change. At the same time, the Local Oscillator (4), whose impedance remains unchanged, continues to generate a fixed frequency f2. The mixer (3) "heterodynes" or multiplies the two input signals using a diode or similar nonlinear circuit element. When the two oscillating signals are multiplied, the output is another oscillating signal that has two simultaneous frequencies of oscillation, the sum frequency (f1+f2) and the difference frequency (f1-f2)- By suitably selecting the impedance of the circuit elements in the variable frequency oscillator (2) and the local oscillator (1),f1 and f2 are selected to lie in the MHz range which is inaudible to the human ear. Hence, f1+ f2 will also be inaudible. But the impedances are chosen so that the difference frequency f1-f2 falls within the audio range of the human ear. The output of the Mixer (3) is sent through a low pass filter (5) . This filter removes the mixer's inaudible heterodyne sum products, leaving the audible difference, or "beat frequency" product which is then amplified by the audio amplifier (6).<br><br>
US Patent no: 1658953 for a Signaling apparatus of L. Theremin. The object of the invention is to build a device such that the movement of an object or other variable factor in a predetermined relation to an apparatus embodying the invention causes a variation in the self-inductance or capacity of the oscillating system thereof which in turn brings about a variation in the frequency of oscillation of the system and such frequency variation causes operation of the sound producer or signaling means. The device shown in Figure 2 comprises a system of connections in which variations of the natural period of an oscillating system 235 are caused by the variation of the capacity of an antenna or control conductor connected to it. The antenna comprises of a wire or flexible lead which is supportingly extended along, around or within the area or district to be protected. Said antenna has a definite normal capacity and this capacity is affected when a person such as a burglar or any object approaches it. The antenna is accordingly hereafter referred to as a control conductor and obviously may take various forms and be arranged in various ways depending upon the use that is made of the signaling apparatus.<br><br>
An electro-ionic oscillator or generator tube 237 is inductively coupled to the oscillating circuit 235. The frequency of the oscillator 237 is adjusted to about the resonance point of the oscillating circuit 235 by proportioning the constants of the associated oscillating circuit 236. When the capacity of the antenna or control conductor is varied by the approach of a foreign object, a corresponding variation of the amplitude of the oscillations of the oscillator 237 takes place resulting from and depending upon the difference between the periods of the oscillating systems 235 and 236.<br><br>
The variation of the grid current in a grid-leak resistance 234 causes a variation of the potential on the grid of a second tube 238, and the plate current of the tube 238, which varies accordingly, may be measured by the measuring instrument 239. If the oscillating systems 235and 236 are so tuned that a retardation of the natural frequency of the circuit 235 brings about a reduction of the oscillation energy of the tube 237, an increase of the capacity of the antenna causes an increase of the plate current through the measuring instrument 239, the increase being substantially proportional to the increase in capacity. As long as the object to be detected is outside of the operating range of the antenna, no variation in the deflection of the instrument 239 will take place. The plate current increases gradually in proportion to the rate at which the object approaches the antenna until it reaches its maximum value when the object has reached the antenna. When the foreign body or object moves slowly towards the antenna, the increase of the plate current of the tube 238 proportionally takes slowly and gradually. When the movement occurs at a higher speed, the plate current rises at a correspondingly greater rate.<br><br>
The device uses the frequency of the direct power at 50 Hz and a combination of electronic tube oscillators, blocking condensers and inductive impedances to change the frequency of the direct power. These are electronic components that are no longer in use today, and have been replaced with faster and more compact components fabricated using semiconductor and modern packaging technology.<br><br>
US Patent No: 6137042 for Visual display for music generated via electric apparatus of Jerome M. Kurtzberg et al.<br><br>
According to this invention, a visual display is provided for music associated with a Theremin or, in general, any space-controlled electric instrument. The Theremin is a space-controlled electric instrument that produces an output of sound corresponding to the motion of the user, without being touched by the user. The device establishes a correspondence between motion and electric signals, then between such signals and either light and sound, or just light. This invention does not anticipate the use of the Theremin as a computer interface, specifically for use with motor control for children with cerebral palsy and does not specifically mention digitization of analog signals.<br><br>
Thus, with reference to Figure 3, the user 20 moves his or her hands in the vicinity of the antenna and metal loop, which are Part of the electric apparatus for sound display 21, and thereby respectively generates the frequency and volume of the signals amplified by the sound displav 22. According to this invention, an electric apparatus for visual display 23 and a corresponding visual display 24 are added to the basic Theremin device. One obtains the visual display by associating the desired visual light spectrum with the underlying electrical signals.<br><br>
The direct relation between the underlying electrical signals and the sound or visual display is not suitable for individuals with cerebral palsy. A rapid change in audio or visual stimuli can cause involuntary spasms in such individuals and hence the device cannot be used in its present embodiment for audio and visual feedback from the Theremin to individuals with cerebral palsy.<br><br>
The devices described above are not useful as alternative and augmentative communication device for individuals with cerebral palsy. The devices rely on the ability to accurately position the human body close to an antenna. Such accurate positioning is not possible for individuals with cerebral palsy. Hence, it is required that the sensitivity of the device be modified. Furthermore, the size of the device as well as its ability to function as an interface to a personal or mobile computer need to be taken into account while modifying the devices mentioned above.<br><br>
Objectives of the present invention<br><br>
Accordingly the main objective of the present invention is to provide An Analog Digital Alternative and Augmentative Communication Device useful for individuals with Multiple Disabilities<br><br>
Another objective of the present invention is to provide An Analog Digital Alternative and Augmentative Communication Device useful for individuals with Multiple Disabilities which does not require the application of pressure which is tiring to the user.<br><br>
Yet another objective of the present invention is to provide An Analog Digital Alternative and Augmentative Communication Device useful for individuals with Multiple Disabilities with a facility of easy change of location providing a respite to the muscles of the user from constant and repetitive use.<br><br>
Still another objective of the present invention is to provide An Analog Digital Alternative and Augmentative Communication Device useful for individuals with Multiple Disabilities that can be operated by the non-contact capabilities by bringing different parts of the users' human body such as head, knee, elbow and palm into contact with the present invention.<br><br>
The objectives of the present invention have been achieved by modifying the minimum Theremin circuit, shown in Fig. 1 and described above, to develop a mouse switch with audio and visual feedback. The device developed can be operated by the non-contact capabilities by bringing different parts of the users* human body such as head, knee, elbow and palm close to the metal antenna.<br><br>
Henceforth, we refer to any part, such as the head, knee, elbow, and hand as the user's body. We also use the term computer to refer to any personal computer or mobile appliance such as laptops, tablet PCs, personal digital assistants (PDAs) or mobile phones that is capable of receiving analog or digital information. The computer can then process the signal in the software developed for this purpose and then provide the user with audio-visual feedback as well as generate more digital signals to control other devices.<br><br>
The device of the present invention is shown in Figure 4.<br><br>
Summary of the invention<br><br>
Accordingly, the invention provides an Analog Digital Alternative and Augmentative Commxinication Device useful for individuals with Multiple Disabilities which comprises of a a metal antenna (1) which acts as one plate of a capacitive element, the other plate of the capacitive element being capable of connected to the neutral, or zero voltage, the output of the antenna (1) being connected to the input of a variable frequency oscillator (2) , the output of the variable frequency oscillator being connected to one of the inputs of the mixer ( 3) the other input of the mixer (3) being connected to local oscillator (4) , the third input of the mixer (4) being connected to a Low pass filter (5) and the output of the low pass filter (5) being connected to an analog signal unit (6), the output of the analog signal unit (6) being connected to a Threshold Detector (7) , the output of the Threshold Detector (7) being connected to one of the inputs of a microprocessor (8), another input of the microprocessor being connected to a System clock (9); one of the outputs of the microprocessor is capable of being connected to a computer (10) and / or a visual display (11) and the second output of the microprocessor capable of being connected to an audio output (12).<br><br>
The subsystem comprising of (l)-(5) is commonly referred to as the minimum Theremin circuit. The low pass filter (5) is followed by a bilateral (or digital) switch having a suitable triggering voltage such that its input and output terminals are shorted (switch closed) with the user's hand about 6 inches away from the antenna (1). The digital switch is called a threshold detector (7). The output of the threshold detector (7) is a number of pulses, the number of pulses depending on the distance of the user's hand from the antenna (1). The microcontroller (8) receives the pulses and counts them. When the number of pulses changes from a pre-determined value programmed into the microcontroller (8), the microcontroller (8) sends a signal to the computer (9) and/or the visual display (10) and/or the audio output (11).<br><br>
There are three embodiments under which the device can draw power. The device can either draw power from an external power supply or draw power from an attached battery or draw power from the computer. When the device draws its power from the computer, it uses a connector called USB or PS2. In yet another embodiment, the device can have an attached battery that charges when connected to the computer.<br><br>
The device is configured to act like a computer mouse with the left click feature only. The microcontrollet can be reptogrammed to provide other functionalities such as the right click of a computer mouse.<br><br>
The functional aspects of the device are described in further detail here. The output of the low pass filter (5) is compared against a fixed voltage threshold voltage using an op-amp acting as a comparator. The output of the comparator is a bilateral (or digital) pulse. The number of pulses generated by the comparator depends on the frequency f1-f2. Since f1-f2 is determined by the distance of the user's body to the metal plate of the antenna, f1-f2 also determines the number of pulses generated by the comparator. The pulses generated by the comparator are fed into the microcontroller which counts the pulses over a fixed time. When the user's body is stationary, the number of pulses over a fixed time does not change and becomes average. The average number of pulses generated by the comparator can be changed by changing the characteristics of the low pass filter. When the number of pulses over a fixed time changes relative to the average number of pulses, the microcontroller senses that the user's body has come close to or moved away from the metal plate of the antenna. The microcontroller then sends a signal to an audio  amplifier that produces a beep. The microcontroller also sends a signal to a computer or any other mobile personal device over a wired interface such as serial port, parallel port, universal serial bus (USB) or a wireless interface such as infra-red or Bluetooth. The computer then activates a graphical user interface (GUI) and runs any software capable of responding to the movement of the user's body. In the next paragraph we describe one such software that can be operated by the device. The microcontroller of the device can be programmed to respond to different movements such as activation on approach towards the antenna, activation on movement away from the antenna. By changing the number of pulses counted before sending a signal to the computer, the microcontroller can also respond to different distances of the user's body from the antenna. The use of a microcontroller with programmable software enables us to adjust the device to compensate for the motor disability of any user.<br><br>
The device can be used in two ways - activation on approach or activation on release. A person using the device can choose between these two ways of activation. Another important feature that is incorporated in the device is the audio output which provides audio feedback when the device is activated. This is immensely helpful to those children as many of them have poor tactual feedback and are unable to tell if they have actually pressed a switch when they used traditional switches. The microcontroller (8) can be programmed to send different sounds to the audio output (11).<br><br>
An embodiment of the present invention is shown in Figure 5. The different parts of the device have to be mounted on to a printed circuit board in the way defined and the antenna has to be packaged in such a way that it is portable, easy to handle, safe, shock-free and has no sharp edges. In this embodiment of the invention, the printed circuit incorporating the various parts is housed inside a box preferably made of non-conducting material such as plastic, provided with a stand to support the antenna. The connection from the microcontroller to the computer (10) or to a visual display (11) will be through a connector also shown in Figure 5. The connector allows the device to be placed behind or to the side of the user, while the user continues to see the computer or visual display. In yet another embodiment the external sharp edges of the antenna may be covered plastic tube or plastic wire. For the plastic tube different colors can be used for giving it an aesthetic look.<br><br>
In another embodiment the device can be connected to a row of LED's (Light emitting diodes) as shown in Figure 6. The number of LEDs that glow, shown in Figure 7 as dark circles, will depend on the proximity of the user's body to the antenna. This is a low cost version of the device that does not require a computer or a visual display. When the user moves relative to the antenna, the number of LEDs that glow will changes. (If color is not allowed, we can change the yellow circles into black circles). The combination of the audio feedback and the visual stimulus, allows the user to gauge his or her proximity to the antenna of the device. By gauging the proximity to the antenna, the user can practice making controlled movements and thereby improve his or her motor coordination capabilities.<br><br>
In yet another embodiment, the device of the present invention when connected to a simple graphical user interface (GUI), executes software that controls a picture displayed on the GUI. When the device is activated, the picture on the GUI changes. The change in the picture functions as a feedback to the user. By placing the device at different distances from the user, the user can view the changes to the picture and self correct their motor movements. Thus, the device acts as a tool for therapy by providing bio-feedback in a rewarding situation.<br><br>
In yet another embodiment, the device can operate any communication chat tool that requires a single-action activation like a mouse-click. The GUI will display the output from a software with scroll functionality. When executed, the software scrolls through menus and buttons available on the GUI and briefly pauses awaiting a user activation. When the user's body moves relative to the antenna, the microcontroller inside the device generates a signal and sends it to the software. The software receives this signal as a user interrupt and scrolls into the next menu or performs a specific task like highlighting or reading out text.<br><br>
In yet another embodiment of the invention, the device may be formed by using a system-on-chip where the functions performed by elements (2) to (8) of fig 4 are implemented on a single electronic chip<br><br>
To perform such a task, the Indian Institute of Technology, Chennai (HTM), has developed, and released as open source, one AAC software known as "HOPE". HOPE works as a one touch communication chat tool that is run on a computer or on an embedded device like a handheld or tablet PC. The software, HOPE, plays the role of a word or sentence builder by using selection of letters starting with a combination of letters. When the device is activated, a particular letter is chosen and highlighted in color. The user can then choose another letter to spell a word or the program will scroll through a list of words that the software predicts. After the user has constructed or chosen a word, the user can begin constructing a new word. When the user has framed a complete sentence, the user activates the DONE button and the constructed sentence appears at the bottom of the GUI. There is also a higher level choice of word or template mode with the latter enabling the user to choose from a previously saved selection of commonly used sentences. All the choices are made by a single click from an input device e.g. left click of the mouse, with a simplified logic flow to enable easy operation as well as erasure and recovery from erroneous clicks. The present invention will function with any software that responds to a mouse click and thus enables a user who cannot speak to use software to communicate independently.<br><br>
The device of the present invention can be made sensitive to proximity to any part of the human body by reprogramming the microcontrollers (8). Placing the antenna (1) appropriately enables the individual to use a movement that he or she is most comfortable with. Since the human body is a good conductor of electricity, the device is triggered when any part of the human body is brought in proximity to the antenna (1). The device has an activation range of about 6 inches and a single tone sound that tells the user that the switch has been activated. The activation range is programmable as per individual needs. The audio feedback tells the user that the switch has been activated even if the user cannot see or control his or her movement. The user can activate the device easily using parts of their bodies (like their head, toes or elbows) as the audio feedback tells them when they have activated it.<br><br>
