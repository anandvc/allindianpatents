Spinning device<br>
The invention relates to a spinning device, a ring spinning or a ring twisting frame in particular, comprising a spindle shaft driven through a whorl according to the preamble of claim 1.<br>
Such a spinning device is for instance known from EP-B-0 4 62 467 and consists of a spindle shaft being provided with an underwinding collar and a locking sleeve and of a spinning ring with a traveller being provided an a ring rail. The locking sleeve or gliding sleeve is kept pre-tensioned against the underwinding collar by means of a compression spring being inserted between the top surface of the whorl and a flange of the locking sleeve. The locking sleeve is being provided with an outer ring which rests against a stopping surface on the ring rail. By means of the ring rail thus the locking sleeve, is being moved upwards or downwards within a limited zone. During underwinding procedure the ring and the traveller are positioned below the underwinding collar, so that the locking sleeve is lifted off the underwinding collar. During doffing movements, when the ring rail is moved upwards, the locking sleeve also moves upwards and clamps the underwound yarn against the underwinding collar, so that the yarn is torn off at the underwinding collar.<br>
Practice has shown that the underwinding can be clamped within the ring gap S between the locking sleeve and the lower area of the spindle shaft beneath the underwinding collar according to figure 2a, so that the underwinding remains on the spindle shaft and has to be removed separately. In case that an operator happens to notice the fault, he then has to remove it very quickly in order to avoid malfunctions in the following spinning process.<br><br>
Therefore the object of the present invention is to improve an already known spinning device in such a manner that the underwindings cannot be clamped anymore within the mentioned ring gap by the locking or sliding sleeve, and thus extra intervention by the operating personnel is not required.<br>
The task as an object of the invention is solved by a spinning device according to the characteristic features of the operative part of claim 1.<br>
The spacers being provided on the spindle shaft, which preferably are being positioned on the sleeve part being pressed onto the spindle, and which are arranged below the underwinding collar avoid the underwindings from directly laying on the spindle shaft, but that they will more or less lay on a circular cylinder which is spaced at a distance from said spindle shaft. Thus it is effectively prevented that the underwindings can still be clamped in the ring gap between the sliding sleeve and the spindle shaft. An additional advantage of this configuration of the spindle shaft is that the underwinding has a smaller support surface on the spindle shaft, which means there is a considerably lower adhesion friction with the spindle shaft. Thereby fly is also reduced during doffing.<br>
The spacers can be formed as projections on the spindle shaft which basically extend in longitudinal direction on the spindle shaft. Advantageously the projections are being distributed evenly on the circumference of the spindle shaft. Furthermore the projections can be provided in the shape of projecting cylinders. Said cylinders can have a cross section of a semicircular, triangular, four-cornered or trapezoidal shape. The projections can be arranged parallel to the longitudinal axis as well as be arranged along a spiral line on the spindle shaft. Normally the spacers are made of one piece with the spindle shaft. For example it is, however, also possible to<br><br>
form them as rods being inserted into dove-tail shaped longitudinal grooves within the spindle shaft.<br>
The cylindrical inner wall of the sliding sleeve, at least in the overlapping zone, can be furnished with projections, which are complementary to the spacers within the area of the spindle shaft.<br>
To achieve an additionally improved separation of the thread between the underwinding and the full cop during doffing, the underwinding collar is preferably provided with a cutting edge within the re-directing zone. The axially directed lateral surfaces of the profiled collar part of the underwinding collar preferably enclose an acute angle with the bottom side of the profiled collar part. In practice particular good results were obtained with a radius of the cutting edge being smaller than 0,2 mm.<br>
Further advantages of the invention will become apparent from the characteristic features of the depending claims and the following description in which the invention is being disclosed according to an exemplified embodiment by way of the accompanying schematic drawings, wherein shows:<br>

Fig. 7   a view of the underwinding collar in direction of arrow B of figure 6, and<br>
Fig. 8   a further exemplified embodiment of a sleeve part and a sliding sleeve.<br>
Figure 1, i.e. figure 2 show a lengthwise cross section of a spinning device with a spindle shaft 1, with a tube 2 slipped onto it and a yarn cop 3 being formed thereon. On a conventional ring rail 6 a spinning ring 5 with a traveller 4 is being furnished, by which - here not further shown - the yarn is being spun and wound onto the tube 2. The lower end of the spindle shaft 1 is being pressed into a whorl 7, which is furnished with a bomb shaped section 8 for the not further shown drive belt. On the whorl 7 a sliding sleeve 9 is being mounted shiftably. Between the upper end surface of the whorl 7 and a ring shaped guiding portion 12 of the sliding sleeve 9, being shiftable on the spindle shaft 1, a compression spring 10 is being inserted, which pre-tensions the sliding sleeve 9 in upward direction. A stopping ring 13 at the outer side of the sliding sleeve 9 is positioned to abut against a stop 21, showing downwards at the ring rail 6, so that the sliding sleeve 9 by the action of the upward directed spring force of the compression spring 10 follows the upward and downward<br><br>
movements X of the ring rail 6 within a limited zone. Furthermore, on the spindle shaft 1 an underwinding collar 15 is being provided in the known manner, below which spacers 22 are being arranged in the form of projections. Said projections 22 are normally provided over the whole length of the spindle shaft 1 below the underwinding collar 15. In the shown illustration, the inner cylindrical wall of the ring-shaped guiding portion 12 is formed complementary to the projections 22, that means it is being provided with corresponding grooves (not further shown).<br>
In figure 1 the spinning device is shown in the so called underwinding position, that means the traveller 4 is positioned for a short time at the same level as the projections 22 of the spindle shaft 1, so that the underwinding below the underwinding collar 15 can be wound after winding of the cop 3 has been completed. Figure 2 shows the same spinning device in the doffing position, that means the underwinding is clamped by the sliding sleeve 9 and the underwinding collar 15. The yarn is thereafter torn off at the underwinding collar 15 during the removal of the tube 2 while the underwinding remains on the spindle shaft 1. For the production of coarse yarn the knife 11 is additionally being provided.<br>
As can be seen from the detailed illustration in figure 2a, the knife 11 is positioned below the underwinding collar 15 and above the sliding sleeve 9, whereat the knife blade, being directed downwards, lays radially outside of the clamping surface 14, 14' on the sleeve part 15', i.e. on the sliding sleeve 9, The downward directed clamping surface 14' of the sleeve part 15' and the upward directed clamping surface 14 on the sliding sleeve 9 can be plane or can be of a fluted configuration. The cutting edge 11' of the knife 11 is in the clamped state of the yarn, i.e. closed state of the sliding sleeve 9, if the clamping surfaces 14, 14' are on top of each other, being positioned below said clamping surfaces 14, 14', so that the cutting edge 11' is farther away from the yarn cop<br><br>
3 than the clamping surfaces 14, 14'. As a result, the yarn 45 indicated in chain-dotted line in figure 2a, follows first a path from the yarn cop 3, down to the cutting edge 11, and then due to the lower position of the cutting edge in relation to the clamping surfaces 14, 14', but after its move around said cutting edge, it is being directed slantedly upwards, until this yarn part encloses the sleeve part 15', i.e. its spacer 22 in circumferential direction in a position, which is being shown as a dot in figure 2a. The length of the underwinding 45 between the clamping surfaces 14, 14' preferably measures less than the length of the circumference at the sleeve part 15', said length being measured at the outside radius of the spacers 22. In that the yarn 45 is being tensioned upwards on both sides of the knife 11' in the direction of the yarn cop 3, good cutting efficiency is achieved, so that during doffing of the yarn cops 3, the yarns 45 can be separated reliably.<br>
Figure 3 now shows the spindle shaft 1 with the underwinding collar 15 in a perspective illustration. The projections 22 are here furnished as outward projecting, semi-circular shaped cylinders 24 which are positioned parallel to the longitudinal axis 25 of the spindle shaft 1. In the first quadrant 27 of the cross section of figure 4 taken along the line I - I of figure 3, said semi-circular projecting cylinders 24 are being illustrated. In the second quadrant 28, as a first variant, the projecting cylinders 29 are of triangular shape, as a second variant in the third quadrant 31, the projecting cylinders 32 are of four-cornered shape and as a third variant in the fourth quadrant 34, the projecting cylinders 35 are of trapezoidal shape. Said projecting cylinders 24, 29, 32, 35 can be made in one piece configuration or can be inserted as rods into dovetail shaped grooves (not shown). Furthermore the cylinders in the form of  spacers 22 are arranged at equal spaces on the circumference of the spindle shaft 1.<br>
Figure 5 shows the spindle shaft 1 with the underwinding collar 15 also in a perspective illustration, whereat the projections<br><br>
22 are being formed as projecting cylinders 38 along the spiral line 37. Said projecting cylinders 38 can have a semi-circular, triangular, four-cornered or trapezoidal cross section as is being shown in the example in figure 3.<br>
Preferably the underwinding collar is made in form of a sleeve part 15' as aluminium diecasting with integrated spacers 22 according to figure 5a, which is being pressed onto the spindle 1. The bottom surface of the underwinding collar is preferably fluted, corresponding with a complementary fluted top surface at the guiding part 12 of the sliding sleeve 9 serving as the clamping surface 14 for the yarn.<br>
The sliding sleeve is preferably made of PBTB reinforced with glass balls, while the stopping ring 13 is being made of plastic doped with MoS2.<br>
In figure 6 the underwinding collar 15 is seen in the direction of arrow A of figure 3. The underwinding collar 15 consists in known manner of projecting collar parts 40 and grooves 41 furnished in-between. Figure 7 shows some of these collar parts 40 and grooves 41 seen in the direction of arrow B in figure 6. The axially aligned lateral surfaces 42 of a respective collar<br>
part 40' enclose an angle a 
 <br>
performance is desirable, then the underwinding collar is preferably made of hardened steel.<br>
For the expert it is obvious that the projections 22 do not necessarily need to be provided over the whole length of the spindle shaft 1 below the underwinding collar 15, but that it can be sufficient to provide an arrangement within the underwinding zone. In such a case, however, a guiding groove would have to be furnished along the spindle shaft 1 below the underwinding collar 15, within which - a not further shown -projection extending inward from the guide part 12 is being guided. Thereby is ensured that the projections 22 interlock with the complementary formed grooves of the guide part 12 of the sliding sleeve 9, while the sliding sleeve 9 is being brought into doffing position with the ring rail 6.<br>
On the other hand, instead of the described cylindrical spacers 22, there could also be longitudinal grooves in the spindle shaft 1 below the underwinding collar 15, which engage with projections that extend inward from the guide part 12. In such a case too, it would be assured that the underwound yarn cannot get into the ring gap between the guide part 12 and the spindle<br>
shaft 1. The enclosing angle a should lay between 20° and 70°.<br>
According to figure 8 the spacers 22 can be furnished in a stepped configuration, in such a way, that at some distance from the underwinding collar 15 the lower section 22a of a spacer 22 is extending radially further outwards than the corresponding upper section 22b of a spacer 22. While laying the underwinding yarn the ring rail 6 with the ring 5 and the traveller 4 is positioned radially outside the lower section 22a of the spacers 22, so that a surplus length of the underwinding 45 results, this being in comparison with an underwinding length, which would otherwise be obtained, if it was wound onto the upper section 22b of the spacers 22. With the upward movement of the sliding sleeve 9, the underwinding<br><br>
45 is being shifted from the lower section 22a to the upper section 22b of the spacers 22 until the underwinding is in a position between the clamping surfaces 14, 14', i.e. fluted surfaces 14a, 14b as is illustrated in the figures 2, 2a and 8. The so-called surplus length of the underwinding 45, which origins from its previous position on the lower sections 22a is being compensated during clamping of the underwinding between the bottom side of the underwinding collar 15 and the upper-side of the sliding sleeve 9, in that the yarn, i.e. the underwinding 45 between the projections, i.e. grooves of the flutes 14a, 14b is being changed into a crimped configuration, as is being illustrated in figure 5a, whereat the yarn, i.e. the underwinding 45 is being shown at distance from the fluted surface 14b, i.e. the upper clamping surface 14'. This way the yarn, i.e. the underwinding 45, can adapt to the form of the clamping surfaces 14, 14', whereat due of the unevenness of the flutes 14a, 14b, it is being deviated a number of time. Due to these deviations the friction between the yarn 45 and the clamping surfaces 14, 14', i.e. the toothed surfaces 14a, 14b is considerably increased, so that also coarse yarns or yarns with high tensile strength can be held securely, while the yarn cops 3 are being taken off the spindle shaft 1. This way the yarn separation is always taking place at the bottom side of the underwinding collar 15, i.e. at the cutting edge 11', if a knife 11 is being provided.<br><br><br><br><br>
