				<td>"A FLUORESCENT LANTHANIDE METAL CHELATE INDTCATOR, METHOD FOR ITS PREPARATION AND DETECTION OF ANALYTES USING THE SAME"<br>
The invention relates to a method for the preparation of a fluorescent lanthanide metal chelate indicator molecule, useful for detecting the presence or concentration of an analyte. The invention also relates to a method for detection of analytes using the indicator.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
This invention relates to fluorescent compounds useful as indicator molecules for detecting the presence or concentration of ar. anaiyte in a medium, such as a liquid, and to methods for achieving such detection. More particularly, the invention relates to fluorescent ianrhanide metal chelate complexes containing substituted Iicands and their use as indicator molecules for detecting the presence or concentration of an analyte such as glucose cr other cis-diol compound in a medium, including a liquid medium such as a biological fluid.<br>
2.	Description of the Related Art<br>
Certain rare-earth metal chelates emit visible light upon irradiation with UV light and different forms of visible light (e.g., violet or blue light), an emission which is characterized by the chelated cation.  Some lanthanide ions, such as those of europium (Eu3+)<br>
-1-<br>
 samarium (Sm3), terbium (Tb3.) , and to a lesser extent dysprosium (Dy3+) and neodymium (Nd3) , exhibit typical fluorescence characterized by the ion, especially when cheiated to suitable excitation energy mediating organic ligands.  The fluorescent properties of these compounds -- long Stokes1 shift, narrow band-type emission lines, and unusually long fluorescence lifetimes -- have made them attractive candidates for fluorescent immunoassays and time-resolved fluorometric techniques.<br>
The major emission lines of these fluorescent lanthanide chelates are formed from a transition called hypersensitive transition and are around 613-615 nm with Eu 545 {and 490) nm with Tb3', 590 and 643 nm with Sm3\ and 573 with Dy3+.  See Hemmila, Application of Fluorescence in Immunoassays. 140-42 (1991).  See also Spectroscopy in Inorganic Chemistry, vol. 2, at 255-85 (Academic Press 3971).  Radiation is typically absorbed by the chelates at a wavelength characteristic of the organic ligand and emitted as a line spectrum characteristic of the metal ion because of an intramolecular energy transfer from the ligand to the central metal ion.  The organic ligand absorbs energy and is raised or excited from its singlet qround state, So, to any one of the vibrational multiplets of the first singlet excited state, S, where it rapidly loses its excess vibrational energy.  At this point, there are two possibilities: relaxation by an S. - So transition (ligand fluorescence) or intersystem crossing to one of the triplet states, T1.  See E.P. Diamandis et al., Analytical Chemistry 62:(22):1149A (1990); see also Spectroscopy in Inorganic Chemistry, vol. 2, at 255-85 (Academic Press 1971).<br>
Fluorescent europium chelates are known to exhibit large Stokes shifts {-290 nm) with no overlap between the excitation and emission spectra and very narrow (10-nm<br>
-2-<br>
 bandwidth) emission spectra at 615 nm.  In addition, the long fluorescence lifetimes (measurable in microseconds instead of the nanosecond lifetimes measurable for conventionsl fluorophores) of the chelates help filter out noise and other interference having a low fluorescent lifetime.  The long fluorescent lifetimes thus permit use of the chelates for microsecond time-resolved fluorescence measurements, which further reduce the observed background signals.  Additional advantages of using europium chelates include that europium chelates are not quenched by oxygen.<br>
Line emissions of two europium (Eu) chelates, Eu-dibenzoylmethide and Eu-benzoylacetonate, have made the chelates attractive candidates for use in lasers.  See H. Samuelson, et al. (J. Chem. Physics 39 (1): 110-12 (1963)) Samuelson, et al. studied the fluorescence and absorption of the above two europium chelates as solids and in solution.  Samuelson, et al. compared the fluorescent lifetimes of the europium chelates under various ********conditions with the lifetimes of europium 'fluorescence in other compounds.  Based on this comparison, Samuelson, et al. suggested that the variation in lifetixes between the two groups of europium compounds is a result of the ligand-Eu interaction in the europium chelates. Specifically, Samuelson et al. determined that various err.ission lines from Eu-ciber. zoylmet hide showed fluorescent lifetimes of 480 +/- 50 ps, which were significantly greater than the fluorescent lifetimes in other europium compounds.<br>
Crosby, et al., J. Cheir. Physics H:743 (1961) had previously studied the role of intramolecular energy transfer in sensitizing ion emission from rare-earth metal chelates, including europium dibenzoylmethide and europium benzoylacetonate chelates.  Whan, et al., J. Mol. Spectroscopy 8: 315-27 (1962) reported that the<br>
-3-<br>
 emission from chelates of a group of lanthanide meta] ions (Eu3+, 7b3+, Dy3+ and Sm3+} was dominated by bright spectra] lines characteristic of the individual rare-earth metal ions.  Whan, et al. found that both the benzoylacetonates and dibenzoylmethides of Eu3+ and Tb3+ are especially bright emitters and that the bright line emissions and low yields of phosphorescence from these chelates indicated that: intramolecular energy transfer from the ligands to the Eu3+ and Tb3+ ions of these chelates occurs efficiently.  Whan, et al., at 324.<br>
N. Eilipescu, et al., J. Physical Chem. 68(111:3324 {1964) reported that the fluorescence spectra of europium and terbium b-diketone chelates are modified when substituents are changed in the organic ligar.d portion of the chelates.  Fiiipescu, et al. discussed the relative intensity, spectral distribution, shifting, and splitting of the fluorescence lines of the europium and terbium chelates in relation to the nature of substituents, their position, molecular configuration, and the overall intramolecular energy transfer.  Filipescu, et al. found that the overall fluorescence intensity characteristic of the ion depended on two factors: 1) the amount of energy . available at the organic triplet., and 2) the efficiency of energy transfer to the ion.<br>
Filipescu, et al. also found that the above two factors varied for different substituents.  For instance, the substitution of europium dibenzoylmethide chelates with electron-donor methoxy groups in the meta position on the chelate was found to enhance the fluorescent emission of the europium ion, whereas paramethoxy substitution was found to decrease the europium fluorescence.  Additionally, the effect was more pronounced for the di- than for the monomethoxy-substituted dibenzoylmethides.  In contrast, an opposite effect was observed for nitro-substituted<br>
-4-<br><br>
 cibenzoylmethides of europium.  The electron-withdrawing nitro groups attached to the para or meta positions were found to decrease the total ionic emission of europium. Additionally, the effect was more pronounced for di- than for monosubstituted dibenzoylmethides.<br>
Filipescu, et a 1  further found that the strong ionic fluorescence emitted by europium para-<br>
phenyldibenzoylmethide indicated that increasing the size of the aromatic system enhanced the amount of energy transferred to the europium ion.  This fact was confirmed by the emission results obtained for napthyl-substituted diketones which were found to have substantially higher ionic emissions than the dibenzoylmethide chelates. Filipescu, et al., at 3.328-29.<br>
E. Diamandis, et a.l., Analytical Chemistry 62 (22) :1149A (2990), described how europium chelates can be used as labels in fluorescence immunoassays and DNA hybridization assays.  With respect to fluorescent immunoasays, the authors described that europium chelates can be used as immunological labels in various assay configurations, including either competitive or noncompetitive assays.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 4,374,120 (Scini, et al.) describes a method for detecting a substance using a fluorescent ianthanide chelate complex as a marker.  U.S. Patent No. 4,374,120 also describes the use of b-diketones as enhancing ligands for promoting the strong fluorescence properties of certain lanthanide chelates, especially chelates of europium and terbium.<br>
Wallac (Turku, Finland) developed a lanthanide metal chelate to replace radiation tags for conducting immunoassays, having the structure:<br>
- 5 -<br><br>
The Wallac molecule was found to behave very efficiently in dilute solutions.  See Hemnila, Applications of Fluorescence in Immunoassays. p.  149 (1991).<br>
Certain conditions are required for using lanthanide metal chelates in aqueous solutions, such as in biological fluids.  For example, it is known that chelates must, first, be dissolved in the aqueous solution, and second, avoid being quenched by water molecules which tend to fill up the empty coordination sites of the lanthanide ion.  However, various adducts or Lewis bases, such as phosphines, phosphine oxides, or nitrogen heterocycles, have been used in addition to the ligand structure to form an "insulating sheet" around the lanthanide ion, enhancing the fluorescence by preventing water molecules from penetrating into the complex's inner sphere.  For example, solutions developed for fluorometric determinations of lanthanides in aqueous systems (e.g., immunoassays) have comprised 3-diketones and trioctylphosphine oxide ("TOPO") as an adduct forming synorgistic agent, and a detergent (e.g., Triton X100) which forms micelles and helps to solubilize the coordinated complex.  See Applications _of Fluorescence in Immunoassays. at 146-47.<br>
Lanthanide metal chelate complexes have not been previously examined or constructed for the purpose of active detection of an analyte by utilizing a discrete and specific recognition element feature, such as a boronate group for detecting glucose and other cis-diols, through one or more ligands contained in the chelate<br>
-6-<br>
 complex.  As discussed above, lanthanide metal chelates have been investigated primarily for use as laser dyes, substitute labels for radioisotopes, and for attachment to antibodies as labels in immunoassays.  Lanthanide metal chelates also have been used for qualitative analytical procedures for detecting tetracycline.<br>
Glucose is an organic compound indispensable to living organisms and plays an important role in information transmission, energy metabolism and structure formation in such organisms.  For example, glucose, and more particularly, D-glucose, is crucial as an energy source for a variety of cells in constructing various organs.  Glucose is stored in the liver as glycogen, which is released in body fluids as needed for energy consumption.  The production and consumption of glucose are well balanced in the body fluids of a normal or healthy human being, maintaining the glucose concentration constant in the fluids.  Thus, detecting sub-levels or supra-levels of glucose in the blood or the urine provides valuable information for diagnosing such diseases as diabetes and adrenal insufficiency.<br>
A glucose sensor using an enzyme (e.g., as made by Yellow Springs Instruments (YSI), Ohio) is the best known practical measure for detecting glucose.  This technique involves decomposing glucose with an enzyme (glucose oxidase) and measuring the amount of hydrogen peroxide produced by the decomposition through an appropriate means {such as by an electrode).  Although this method is well established, the quality of the enzyme, which originates from a living body, will irreversibly change over time and cannot be recycled for reuse. Additionally, because the glucose is actually consumed in the detection reaction, the intrinsic ability of the glucose sensor to measure low levels of analyte is therefore limited.<br>

 It is well known that boronic acid-containing compounds bind to glucose.  The mechanism is believed to occur through bonding of adjacent hydroxyl groups on glucose to hydroxyl groups on a boronate moiety, as drawn below:<br><br>
The coirplexation of carbohydrates, including glucose, with phenylboronic acia has been known for a long time and the reversibility of that interaction has served as a basis for the chrormatographic separation of sugars. Specifically, in 1959, Lcrand and Edwards reported association constants for aqueous associations of phenylbcronic acic with many saturated polyols; binding interactions ranged fron very weak (e.g., ethylene glycol, K,-360 mM) to moderately strong (e.g., glucose, Kc=9.1 mM) .  See J. Yoon, et al., Biooroanic and Medicinal Chemistry 1 (A) :267- 71 (199 3).<br>
U.S. Patent 5,503,770 (James, et al.) describes a fluorescent boronic acid-containing compound that emits fluorescence of a high intensity upon binding to saccharides, including glucose.  The fluorescent compound has a molecular structure comprising a fiuorophore, at least one phenylboronic acid moiety and at least one amine-providing nitrogen atom where the nitrogen atom is disposed in the vicinity of the phenylboronic acid moiety so as to interact intermolecuiarly with the boronic acid. Such interaction, thereby causes the compound to emit fluorescence upon saccharide binding.  U.S. Patent 5,5C3,77 0 describes the compound as suitable for<br>
-3-	<br>
 detecting saccharides.  See also T. James, et al., Chem. See. 117(35) :3982-87 (1995) .<br>
Additionally, fluorescent sensors using an anthrylboronic acid-containing compound for detecting blood glucose are known in the art.  For example, J. Yoon, et al., J. An  Chem. Soc. 114 :5874-5875 (1992) describe that ar.thrylboronic acid can be used as a fluorescent chemesensor for signaling carbohydrate binding, including binding of glucose and fructose.<br>
An object of the present invention is to detect the presence or concentration of an analyte in a medium such as a liquid cr gas by measuring any change in fluorescence emitted by a lanthanide metal chelate complex upon bindinc of the analyte to one or more cheiators of the chelate complex through an analyte-specific recognition element.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide an analyte-specific, recognition element-containing lanthanide metal chelate complex as an indicator molecule for detecting the presence or concentration of an analyte such as glucose or other cis-diol compound in a medium such as a liquid.<br>
BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is directed to an indicator molecule for detecting the presence or concentration of an analyte, comprising a fluorescent lanthanide metal chelate complex having the formula:<br>

Furthermore, one or more chela tors complexed with N can be the same or a mixture of different chelators (so-called "mixed ligand or ternary chelates").<br>
R represents an analyte-specific recognition element, one or more of which is bound to one or more ligands of the chelate complex, but need not be linked to every ligand of the chelate complex.  In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, R can be a boronate group or a compound containing a boronate group for detecting glucose or other cis-diol compound.<br>
X represents the number of recognition elements R bound to each of one or more chelators.  X can be an integer from 0 to 8, and in certain preferred embodiments oi the invention, X=0 to 4 or X=0 to 2.  Additionally, the number of recognition elements R bound to each of one or more chelators may be the same or different, provided that for one or more chelators, X&gt;0.  Y represents the number of chelatcrs complexed with M, and can be an integer from 1 to 4.  In certain preferred embodiments of the invention, Y = l, Y=3 or Y=4.<br>
The present invention also is directed to a fluorescent lanthanide metal chelate complex, as defined above.<br>
The present invention further is directed to methods for detecting the presence or concentration of an analyte by utilizing the above indicator molecule and fluorescent<br>
-10-<br>
 lanthanide metal chelate complex.  The met nod comprises the steps of exposing the sample to an indicator mo1ecule comprising a fluorescent lanthanide metal chelate complex having the above-defined formula, and measuring any change in fluorescence emitted by the lanthanide metal chelate complex, and therey detecting the presence or concentration of the analyte.<br>
In the present invention, the presence or<br>
concentration of the anaiyte is detected by measuring any change in fluorescence emitted by the lanthanide metal chelate complex upon binding of the analyte to one or more chelators of the chelate complex through one or more analyte-specific recognition elements.  Specifically, the presence or concent rat i or. of an analyte, such as glucose or other cis-diol compound, is determined by observing and/or measuring the change in intensity or lifetime of fluorescence emitted by the fluorescent metal ion (i.e., the fluorescence is attenuated, enhanced or shifted in wavelength) upon binding of the analyte to the analyte-specific recognition element of the cheiate, which for detecting glucose or other cis-diol compound is a boronate-ccntaining recognition element.<br>
The present invention offers the advantage of being able to detect an analyte, such as glucose or other cis-diol compound, in an analyte-specific manner in a medium such as a liquid or a gas, utilizing a fluorescent indicator molecule having a fluorescent lifetime of sufficient length {measurable in microseconds instead of nanoseconds), as well as having a long Stoke's shift, thereby decreasing the effect of any background noise and other interference which would reduce the sensitivity of the analyte detection, and is not concentration quenched.<br>

The organic ligand of Ch can also comprise any one or more of a heterocycle of nitrogen, sulfur, and linked carbcxyls.<br>
R represents an analyce-specific recognition element, one or more of which is bound to one or nore ligands of the chelate complex, but need not be linked to every ligand of the chelate complex.  In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, R can be a group for detecting glucose or other cis-diol or cis-diol acting compounds. Such groups include boronates, arsenites and germanates,<br>
-13-<br>
 and compounds containing those groups.  Representative bororate-containing compounds include those having the following general structures (in each structure, R' and R" are each independently fused aryl; aliphatic; primary, secondary or tertiary amine; amide; carboxyl; ketone; ester; alcohol; or aldehyde; and Y and 2 are each independently aliphatic, alkoxy or aryl):<br><br>
wnerein r. is 0 or 1 in the left structure and 0, 1 or 2 in the right structure;<br>
-14-<br><br><br>
-15-<br><br><br>
-16-<br><br>
wherein n is 0 or 1, and the boronic acid and amine substituents are located as a pair on positions 1 and 10, 3 and 4, 6 and 7, 7 and 8 or 9 and 10.<br>
Some specific boronate-containing compounds include:<br><br>
-17-<br><br>
-18-<br><br>
-19-<br><br>
-20-<br><br>
-21-<br><br>
-22-<br><br>
-23-<br>
 Examples of cis--diol analyse compounds other than glucose include ether sugars such as fructose and glycerol. Catechoi s (o-dihydroxybenzenes) and catecho1amines, including hormones such as dopamine, epinephrine and norepir.ephrine, contain adjacent (ortho) hydroxyls which mimic cis-diols with respect to their reactivity with boronate recognition elements.<br>
The lanthanide metal ion M can be that of europium (Eu3+) , samarium (Sm3+) , terbium (Tb3+) , dysprosium (Dy3+) or neodymium (Nd3+) , and is preferably an ion of europium (Eu3-) or terbium, (Tb3+).<br>
The ligand of the cheiator Ch can also be an organic ligand comprising any one or more of an alkane or alkene group, preferably containing 1 to 10 carbon atoms, as well as aromatic, carbocyclic or heterocyclic moieties, including benzyl, napthyi, anthryl, phcnanthryl or uetracyl groups.  The ligand can also comprise groups such as -CFj and C2F.,, as long as the ligand further comprises a moiety to which en analyte-specific recognition element P. can be bound, if desired. Additionally, any ligand of a chelate complex may be inorganic instead of organic.<br>
X represents the number of recognition elements R bound to each of one or more chelators.  X can be an integer from 0 tc 6, and in certain preferred embodiments of. the invention, X=O to 4 or X=0 to 2.  Additionally, the number of recognition elements R bound to each of one or more chelators may be the same or different, provided that for one or more chelators, X&gt;0.  Y represents the number of chelators complexed with M, and can be an integer from 1 to 4 .  In certain preferred embodiments of the invention, Y=l, Y=3 or Y=4.<br>
In certain embodiments of the present invention, the lanthanide metal chelate complex can comprise a mixture of di fferent chelators wherein one or more of the<br>
-21-<br>
 chela tors do not contain an analyte-specific recogniticri element R.  The advantages of using such a mixed ligar.d chelate, also known as a ternary ligand chelate, include that some organic ligands, such as polyamino-pe1ycarboxylic acids, are more soluble in water than other ligands, such as a b-diketone.  Therefore, in at least one embodiment of the invention, the lanthanide metal chelate complex car. comprise, first, one or more ft-diketones containing one or mere analyte-specific recognition elements, and second, one or more other ligands such as a pel yarnino-pcl yea rboxylic acid, which promote the water solubility of the chelate complex.<br>
In other embodiments of the present invention, one or more chelators of the chelate complex can further comprise an. -NH, or -OH group, or any other substituent by wr.ich the chelate complex can attach covalently to a linker or polymer such as a polyiysine, or ether solid support.<br>
In order to achieve energy transfer from the light absorbing portion of the complex to the lanthanide metal ion, the triplet state energy of the light absorbing portion is preferably above about 230 kj/mol.  Preferred light absorbing portions include phenanthridine (258 kJ/mol ) , psoraier. (262 kJ/mol), phenoxazane (261 kJ/mol), phenanthrene {258 kj/mol), triphenyiene (280 kJ/mol), ber.zophenone (287 kJ/mol), carbazcle (293 kj/mol) and coumarin (258 kj/mol) .<br>
The fluorescence of the lanthanide metal chelate complex of the present invention is modulated in an analyte-specific manner by the binding of an analyte to one or more chelators of the chelate complex through one or more recognition elements R.<br>
The fluorescent indicator molecules of the present invention can be used for detecting a variety of different possible chemical analytes which are reactive<br>
-25-<br>
 -26-<br>
with, and thus can be detected in a specific manner by, an analyte-specific recognition element R.  Preferred analytes for detection using the present invention are analytes such as glucose, fructose and other cis-diol compounds.  However, depending on the choice of the recognition element, the indicator molecules of the present invention are also useful to detect many ether analytes.  For example, the following molecule has a recognition element which makes it useful as a pH indicator {see Lippitsch, et al., Sensors and Actuators B 38-39 (1997} 96-102}:<br><br>
 -27-<br>
In addition, following is one of many possible compounds which contains a recognition element: which may be used to bind a zinc analyte (see, e.g., Huston, et al., JACS 1988, 110, 4460):<br><br>
 -28-<br>
Zinc binding as shown will increase the fluorescence of that indicator molecule, and others like it containing a similar recognition element.  Further, following is one of many possible compounds which contains a recognition element which may be used to detect a potassium analyte (see, e.g., Sousa, et al., ACS Symposium Series 538, 1992, pp. 10-24):<br><br>
 In that compound, the potassium ion is coordinated within the crown ether moiety, causing a three-dimensional configuration change such that the aniline portion of the molecule is folded over onto the phenanthridine portion, resulting in the quenching of fluorescence.<br>
The chemical analytes detectable using the indicator molecules of the present invention can exist in various different solid, gaseous and liquid forms.  Additionally, analytes can foe detected using the indicator molecules of the present invention in various mediums, including both liquid and gaseous mediums.<br>
A number of possible uses exist for the fluorescent compounds of the present invention, including uses as indicator molecules in the fields of energy, medicine and agriculture.  For example, the fluorescent compounds can be used as indicator molecules for detecting sub-levels or supra-levels of glucose in blood or urine, thus providing valuable information for diagnosing such diseases as diabetes and adrenal insufficiency. Medical/pharmaceutical production of glucose for human therapeutic application requires monitoring and control. Possible uses for the present invention in agriculture include detecting levels of an analyte such as glucose in soybeans and other agricultural products.  Glucose must be carefully monitored in critical harvest decisions for such high value products as wine grapes.  As glucose is the most expensive carbon source and feedstock in fermentation processes, glucose monitoring for optimum reactor feed rate control is important in power alcohol production.  Reactor mixing and control of glucose concentration also is critical to quality control during production of soft drinks and fermented beverages, for which production is consumed the largest amounts of glucose and fermentable (cis-diol) sugars internationally.<br>
-29-<br>
 various detection- techniques also are known in the art that ran make use of the fluorescent compounds of the present invention .  For example, the fluorescent compounds of the invention can be used in fluorescent sensing devices (e.g., U.S. Patent No. 5,517,313) or car. be bound to polymeric material such as test paper for visual inspection.  This latter technique would permit, for example, glucose measurement in a manner analogous to determining pH with a strip of litmus paper.  The fluorescent molecules described herein may also be uc j .1.1 zed as simple reagents with standard bench top ana lyrical instrumentation such as spectrofluorometers or ciinicai analyzers as nade by Shimadzu, Hitachi, Jascc, Beckman and others.  These molecules would also provide ar.a lyte specific chemical/optical signal trans duct ion for fiber optic-based sensors and analytical fluorometers as mace by Ocean Optics {Clearwater, Florida), or Oriel OpticK.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, various possib] e che.i.ators, one or more of which can be complexed with a lanthanide metal ion, comprise an organic ligand having attached thereto one or more boronate groups as the analyte-specific recognition croup P, examples of which are shown below.<br>

Some of the most preferred fluorescent, boronate recognition element-containing lar.thanide chelates of the present invention include the following europium chelates (shown having only one ligand for purposes of clarity) comprising the following structures:<br>
-34-<br><br>
Europium Benzovlethylene methane-2-boronate (IV) In a preferred embodiment of. the present invention, a boronate-containing recognition element which is analyte-specific for glucose or other cis-diol compound was attached to a fluorescent europium (tetrakis) beta-r.aphthoyltrifluoroacetate (Eu-bNTA) chelate.  The organic ligand portion of the chelate was known to form a shell around the lanthanide metal ion (e.g., europium), as drawn below:<br>
-35-<br><br>
Additionally, that different solvents affect the fluorescent decay time of the lanthanide metal ion (e.g., water quenches the fluorescence of the europium ion) also was known.  It was thus investigated whether modifying the organic ligands of the outer shell with an analyte-specific recognition element (e.g., a boronate-containing recognition element) would perturb the decay time of the europium ion to any notable extent.  The following europium chelate, europium (tetrakis) naphthoyltrifluoromethane (Eu-bNTA) boronate, was synthesized and tested.<br><br>
Eu-bNTA boronate was found to have an excitation wavelength of about 340 nm and an emission wavelength<br>
-36-<br>
 which was the same as for other europium chelates, about 613 run.<br>
Other preferred compounds for the detection of cis-diols including glucose include the following.<br>
-37-<br><br>
-38-<br><br>
-39-<br><br>
-40-<br><br>
-41-<br><br>
-42-<br><br>

-45-<br>
 As shown in Figures 4-5, the advantages cf the present invention were demonstrated by a preferred embodiment by measuring the effect of catechol (o-cihydroxybenzene) on both the fluorescent intensity and lifetime of Eu-bNTA in an ethanol solution.  The changes in fluorescent intensity detected and measured after adding catechol to the ethanol solution in the presence of Eu-bNTA are shown in Figure 5.  The fluorescent lifetime of Eu-bNTA without a boronate-containing recognition element was 362 us ±1 us, while the fluorescent lifetime of Eu-bNTA boronate decreased to 270 us ±4 ps.  After exposing the Eu-bNTA boronate to catechol, the fluorescent lifetime of the molecule further decreased to 209 ps ±15 us.<br>
The effect of catechol on the fluorescent intensity and lifetime of Eu-bNTA boronate also was measured in water and was shown to quench the fluorescence of the europium ion of the chelate.  Trioctylphosphine ("TOPO") was then added to protect the coordination sites located on the inner shell of the europium chelate complex from the quenching effects of the water.  The addition of TOPO E.o the aqueous solution containing Eu-bNTA boronate is depicted in Figure 3.<br>
Eu-NTA boronate also was able to detect the presence of glucose in methanol.  Specifically, a glucose titration with Eu-NTA boronate was performed in methanol. Data obtained from, the glucose titraticn are shown in Figures 6-8.  Figure 6 depicts a Eu-NTA boronate titration against an increasing concentration of glucose, Fiqure 7 depicts an expansion of the low range of the data points shown in Figure 6.   The results shown in Figure 7 demonstrate that Eu-NTA boronate can detect the presence of glucose at concentrations well below normal physiological levels of approximately 4.7 mMol.  Shown by the data plot in Figure 7, differences in glucose<br>
-46-<br>
 concentrations car be discriminated within the physiological range of less than about 0.5 mMol. Although Figure 7, because of the close proximity of data points below .001 mMol glucose, does not show the lower end sensitivity of Eu-bNTA boronate to changes in glucose concentration, Figure S plots the low range of Figure 7 as the semi-log plot of glucose concentration versus I/I().<br>
Figure 9 shows the results of titrating europium cibenzoylmethane (Eu(DBM)) and Eu (boronated DBM) separately with glucose and fructose in methanol. Specifically, glucose and fructose concentrations were varied as .0005, .005, .05, 1, 5, 10 and 2G mM.  The data plots for glucose B and fructose B in Figure 9 represent glucose and fructose titrations of Eu (boronated DBM) .  It is readily seen from the results in Figure 9 that the fluorescent intensity of boronated europium cibenzoyimethane increases significantly when exposed to concentrations of glucose and fructose above about 0.01 mM, while the fluorescent intensity of the non-bcronated Eu(DBM) does not change to any notable extent upon the addition of glucose and fructose.  Without a specific recognition element (e.g., a boronate), the lanthanide metal chelate complex is net responsive to the presence of glucose, fructose or other cis-diol compounds. Accordingly, with an analyte-specific recognition element, in this example a boronate group, the lanthanide cnelate complex of this invention is sensitive to the presence of glucose, fructose and other cis-diol compounds, and thus can be utilized to detect the presence or concentration of such and other analytes.<br>
Figures 10-13 further demonstrate the ability of lanthanide metal chelate complexes in accordance with the present invention to detect the presence or concentration of glucose and/or fructose in a sample.<br>
-47-<br>
 As stated above, the fluorescent indicator molecules of the present invention can be used in many different types of fluorescent sensors.  The fluorescent indicator molecules con be used in the sensors to detect the presence or concentration of an analyte such as glucose or other cis-diol compound in a sample such as a liquid sample, including a biological fluid, and more specifically a human fluid.  For example, fluorescent indicator molecules in accordance with the present invention can be dispersed in a polymer matrix which is permeable to glucose or other cis-diol compound.  The presence or concentration of glucose or other cis-diol compound in a medium such as a liquid medium can then be determined by measuring the change in intensity or lifetime of fluorescence emitted by the indicator molecule after binding to glucose or other cis-dicl compound through one or more boronate-containing recognition elements.<br>
U.S. Patent 5,517,313, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference, describes a fluorescence sensing device in which the fluorescent indicator molecules of the present invention can be used to determine the presence or concentration of an analyte such as glucose or other cis-diol compound in a liquid medium.  The sensing device comprises a layered array of a fluorescent indicator molecule-containing matrix (hereafter "fluorescent matrix"), a high-pass filter and a photodetector.  In this device, a light source, preferably a light-emitting diode ("LED"), is located at least partially within the indicator material, such that incident light from the light source causes the indicator molecules to fluoresce.  The high-pass filter allows emitted light to reach the photodetector, while filtering out scattered incident light from the light source.<br>
-48-<br>
 The fluorescence of the indicator molecules employed in the device described in U.S. Patent 5,517,313 is modulated, e.g., attenuated or enhanced, by the local presence of an analyte such as glucose or other cis-diol compound.<br>
In the sensor described in U.S. Patent 5,517,313, the material which contains the indicator molecule is permeable to the analyte.  Thus, the analyte can diffuse into the material from the surrounding test medium, thereby effecting the fluorescence emitted by the indicator molecules.  The light source, indicator molecule-containing material, high-pass filter and photodetector are configured such that at least a portion of the fluorescence emitted by the indicator molecules impacts the photodetector, generating an electrical signal which is indicative of the concentration of the analyte (e.g., glucose} in the surrounding medium.<br>
In accordance with other possible embodiments for using the fluorescent indicator molecules of the present invention, fluorescence sensing devices also are described in co-penaing U.S. Patent Application Nos. 08/855,234, 08/855,235, and 08/855,236, all incorporated herein by reference.<br>
The fluorescent indicator molecules of the present invention can be prepared by persons skilled in the art without an undue amount of experimentation using readily known reaction mechanisms and reagents, including reaction mechanisms which are consistent with the general procedures described below.<br>
Preparation of Boronated Europium Tetrakis b-Diketone Complexes<br>
1. Naphthalene-1-boronic acid, as available from Frontier Scientific (Logan, Utah), is dissolved in toluene.<br>
-49-<br>
 2.  The boronic acid must first be protected (capped) by reacting it with 2,2-aimethyl-l,3-propanediol (Aldrich Chemical Company) while azeotropically removing water by using a Dean-Stark trap to provide 2,2-dimethyIpropane-1,3-diyl 1-naphthylboronate, as shown below:<br><br>
3.  The capped boronic acid can then be acylated by Friedel-Crafts acetylation by reacting the boronic acid with acetic anhydride and aluminum trichloride in anhydrous carbon disulfide to produce 2,2-<br><br>
-50-<br>
dimethylpropane-1,3-diyl 5-acetyl-1-naphthylboronate.  An approximately 70% yield of the reaction product, which appears as a viscous liquid, will typically result, as shown below:<br>
 4.  The b-diker.one can then be formed and the boronate can be decapped by a Claisen condensation between (3) and ethyl trifluoroacetate (Aldrich) using sodium methoxide {in dry ether) as the condensing agent, as shown below:<br><br>
5.	The intermediate product (4), 5-naphthoyl-<br>
trifiuoroacetoneboronic acid, can then be purified by preparative silica gel TLC while eluting with methylene chloride.  In at least one preparation, the third band elation (Rf=0 .70-0.85) was recovered from the plate and analyzed by proton NMR at 400 MHZ.  The NMR spectrum exhibited a pattern which was characteristic of the enol form of the (b-diketor.e, specifically showing peaks at sigma 6.69 (singlet) and at sigma 15.28 (broad singlet).<br>
6.	The final europium tetrakis indicator complex<br>
containing a boronate group as the analyte-specific<br>
recognition element is produced by reacting the b-<br>
ciketone (4), with europium trichloride hexahydrate<br>
(Aidrich) and piperidine in absolute ethanol, as shown below:<br>
-51-<br><br>
The solution is then heated to 70°C for three hours. After heating, the resultant solution shows a characteristic orange-red emission upon irradiation with a handheld, long-wave UV source.  Additionally, a fluorescence scan with a Shimadzu fluorometer shows a peak excitation wavelength of 34 0 nanometers and a europium complex characteristic peak emission wavelength of 613 nanometers.<br>

Synthesis   of  Europium  Tetrakis   -5-naphthoyl-trifluoroacetoneboronic  acid<br>
I.     Preparation   of   2,2-dimethylpropane-l,3-diyl-<br>
1-naphthylboronate   (1)<br>
The  boronate  group  of   the  precursor   is  protected   from any  potential   adverse  effects  caused by  subsequent reaction   conditions  during   synthesis   of  the  europium chelate   complex   according  to  the   following  procedure:<br>
Naphthalene-1-boronic  acid   (1.5.2   grams,   0.0884  moles) and  2,2-dimethyl-l,3-propanediol    (10.0   grams,   0.0960 moles,    1.1   equivalents)   were   refluxed  in  toluene   (200ml) while   removing  water  azeotropically  using  a   Dean-Stark trap  for  28  hours.     The  toluene  was  then evaporated by simple  distillation,   followed by  aspirator pressure distillation  while  heating   for   2   hours   until   reaching  a temperature  of   about   80°C.     The  unreacted  2,2-dimethyl-<br>
-65-<br>
 1,3-propanediol  was  then  removed  under vacuum   (0.5mm) while  heating  up  to   60°C   for   1   hour.     A white   solid (20.94   grams,   99%   purity)   of  2, 2-dimethylpropane-l,3-diyl-1-naphthylboronate  was  obtained.<br>
The  product  was  verified by  1NMR   (CDC13,    400MHz).<br>
II.      Friedel-Crafts  Acetylation:   Preparation  of   2,2-<br>
dimethylpropane-1,3-diyl-5-acetyl-l-naphthylboronate<br>
(2.)<br>
An acetyl group was introduced into the aromatic structure of the precursor to form a diketone, according to the following procedure:<br>
2,2-dimethylpropane-l,3-diyl-l-naphthylboronate (1) (21.0 grams, 0.0878 moles) was dissolved in 150 ml of dry carbon disulfide while stirring in a 250 ml round bottom flask in an ice water bath.  Separate portions of aluminum trichloride (28.7 grams, 0.215 moles) were added over a period of two hours.  The mixture was then stirred and slowly warmed to room temperature over a period of one hour.  A sticky, dark, semisolid was seen deposited inside the flask.  The mixture was cooled again in an ice water bath, whereafter a refluxing condenser was added to the flask.  Acetic anhydride (8.93 grams, 0.0875 moles) was then added over a period of 2 hours.  The mixture was then warmed to 40°C to initiate the reaction.  During addition of the acetic anhydride, it was necessary to agitate the reaction mixture (by hand swirling) occasionally, as to control any exothermic reaction which might occur during the reaction.<br>
After allowing the reaction mixture to sit at room temperature for 2 hours, the mixture was then heated<br>
-66-<br>
 slowly to 50°C over a period of 1 hour and maintained at that temperature for three hours.  A dark solid was observed to form in the reaction mixture.<br>
800 ml of ice water, 15 ml of concentrated hydrogen chloride and 250 ml of methylene chloride were then used together to decompose and extract the reaction mixture into two clear layers.  The bottom organic layer was then collected, dried over sodium sulfate, and evaporated at reduced pressure up to 80°C for three hours to yield 19.39 g of dimethylpropane-1,3-diyl-5-acetyl-l-naphthylboronate (2} in a semisolid form, having a yield<br><br>
of 78%<br>
III. Claisen Condensation: Preparation of 5-naphthoyl-trifluoroacetoneboronic acid (3)<br>
A b-diketone ligand was formed, as follows:<br>
A mixture of sodium hydride was reacted with 2 ml of methanol {0.313 gram, 0.01302 moles) in 10 ml of dry ether.  The resulting solution was dried under reduced pressure up to 100°C for two hours to yield sodium methoxide in a solid form.  The sodium methoxide was then treated with 45 ml of dry ether and cooled in an ice water bath.  Ethyl trifluoroacetate (1.7 63 grams, 0.0124 moles) was then added, followed 10 minutes later by adding a solution of dimethylpropane-1, 3-diyl-5-acetyl-l-naphthylboronate (2) (3.50 grams, 0.0124 moles) in 20 ml of dry ether, which solution was added dropwise over a period of another 10 minutes.  The mixture was then stirred for 30 minutes at room temperature and heated to' reflux for 70 hours.  While stirring the mixture in an ice water bath, 25 ml of water and 8 ml of 10% hydrogen<br>
-67-<br>
 chloride were added to acidify the water layer tc a pH of 1.  Two clear layers thereafter appeared in the flask.<br>
The top etheral layer was then collected, dried over sodium sulfate, and evaporated under reduced pressure up to 60°C for 1 hour to yield the b-diketone in a dark liquid form (4.36 grams).  The resultant b-diketone was purified by preparative silica gel TLC by eluting with methylene chloride.  The third band {Rf = 0.70-0.85) was recovered from the TLC plate as a 25% yield of 5-naphthoyl-trifluoroacetoneborcnic acid (3) (1.20 grams).<br>
The product was verified by proton NMR (400 MHZ) spectra having a pattern characteristic of the enol form of the 3-diketone with peaks at sigma 6.69 (singlet) and at sigma 15.28 (broad sinolet).<br>
IV.  Chelation/Complexation: Formation of the europium-(beta-diketoneboronic acid) tetrakis complex (4)<br>
The lanthanide chelate complex for use as a fluorescent indicator molecule was then produced as<br>
follows:<br>
A solution of europium trichloride hexahydrate {0.7 ing, 0.0019 nunoles) in 0.5 ml absolute ethanol was added to a solution of 5-naphthoyl-trifluoroacetoneboronic acid (3) (2.2 mg, .0058 mmole) and piperidine (130 mg) in 0.5 ml of absolute ethanol.  This mixture was heated slowly to 7 0°C over a period of 2 hours and maintained at that temperature for an additional 3 hours to form the europium tetrakis complex (4).<br>
The resultant solution exhibited a characteristic orange-red emission upon irradiation with a hand-held,<br>
-68-<br>
 long wave UV source.  Additionally, a fluorescence spectra, as measured with a Shimadzu fluorometer, showed a peak excitation wavelength of 340 nanometers ar.d an emission pattern characteristic of a europium chelate complex of 613 nanometers.<br>
