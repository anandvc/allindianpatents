				<td>A CASTOR<br>
This invention relates to castors.<br>
Many mobile devices such as shopping and hospital trolleys are manoeuvrable on four<br>
such castors, usually one at each corner, and such devices are notorious for their<br>
inability in certain circumstances to permit the trolley to be steered and manoeuvred<br>
easily, particularly when heavily loaded and when it is required to direct the trolley<br>
around corners. This difficulty arises largely through the inability of the castors to rotate<br>
freely about their upright axes.<br>
DE 19741742 and GB 1008550 disclose castors. The present invention defines an<br>
arrangement in which, inter alia, the central bolt or rivet is freely rotatable relative to<br>
the fork and the bearing assembly. Thus, there are at least three independent<br>
rotatable parts. In a preferred embodiment, there are four including the fork, the first<br>
member, the second member and the bolt, whilst in another embodiment there are<br>
three, the fork, the second member and the bolt. In DE 19741742 or GB 1008550, the<br>
central bolt is not rotatable and this applies to all hitherto known castors. The rotatable<br>
bolt is the key feature which provides enhanced manoeuvrability when compared with<br>
conventional castors.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a castor with increased freedom of<br>
rotation about the upright axis in which it is mounted on the frame or chassis of the<br>
trolley.<br>
Typically, such castors are mounted on a thrust bearing which may be subject to<br>
contamination or wear such that the relatively movable parts of the bearing assembly<br>
tend to become stiff, or excessively loose thus to become misaligned.<br>
According to the present invention, there is provided a castor comprising a fork having<br>
a pair of lobes between which extends a transverse axle carrying at least one wheel<br>
rotatable thereon, and a connection member for connecting the castor to a frame or<br>
chassis of an object such as a trolley, the wheel and the connection member being<br>
connected together by at least one bolt or rivet and a bearing assembly; characterised<br>
in that the bolt or rivet is freely rotatable on the bearing assembly; in that the fork is<br>
freely rotatable relative to the bearing assembly; and in that the fork and the bolt or<br>
rivet, are independently rotatable relative to one another.<br>
Preferably, the fork is freely rotatable on a first bearing with respect to a first member<br>
connected to the fork, and the first member is freely rotatable on a second bearing with<br>
respect to a second member connected to the first member, the second member being<br>
adapted for connection to a frame or chassis of a load bearing object such as a trolley.<br>
Preferably, the first and second bearings are on aligned axes. The castor may<br>
comprise three or more roller or ball bearings. The first bearing may be a thrust<br>
bearing. The first bearing may be a journal bearing. The second bearing may be a<br>
journal bearing. The second member may be welded to the frame or chassis. The fork,<br>
first member and second member may be held in aligned assembly by a single central<br>
bolt or rivet. The first member may include a bearing axially aligned with the axis of<br>
rotation of said first member.<br>
The second member may comprise a pair of axially aligned bearings each axially<br>
aligned with the second member.<br>
The single central bolt or rivet may be independently rotatable with respect to the fork<br>
and the second member.<br>
Embodiments of the invention will now be described, by way of example only, with<br>
reference to the accompanying drawing, in which:<br>
Fig. 1 is a part-sectional elevation of a castor made in accordance with a first<br>
embodiment; and<br>
Fig. 2 is a similar view of a castor made in accordance with a second embodiment.<br>
Referring to Fig. 1, there is provided a castor wheel 10 mounted on a transverse axle<br>
11 extending between a pair of lobes 12 of a fork generally indicated at 13.<br>
A cross plate 14 at the top of the fork is connected via a thrust bearing 15 having ball<br>
races 15a, 15b to a first upright member 16 by means of a bolt 17 the shaft of which<br>
extends upwardly through the entire bearing assembly to be secured by a self-locking<br>
nut 18.<br>
By the term "thrust bearing" is meant a bearing wherein, in use, a load applied thereto<br>
is borne by the balls or rollers thereof in an axial direction with respect to the bolt 17.<br>
Surrounding the shaft of the bolt 17 within the first upright member 16 is a first<br>
concentric ball or roller journal bearing 20 having inner and outer races 20a and 20b.<br>
Thus, the fork 13 is freely rotatable on the bearing 15 about the vertical axis of the bolt<br>
17 with respect to the first upright member 16, and the latter is also freely rotatable on<br>
the bearing 20 about the axis of the bolt 17.<br>
By the term "journal bearing" is meant a bearing wherein, in use, a load applied thereto<br>
is borne by the balls or rollers thereof in a radial direction with respect to the bolt 17,<br>
with or without some axial bearing direction.<br>
Also mounted on the shaft of the bolt 17 above the first upright member 16 is a second<br>
upright member 21. This member is mounted on a pair of axially aligned ball or roller<br>
journal bearings 22 and 23 having, respectively inner and outer races 22a, 22b and<br>
23a, 23b, such that the cylindrical wall of the second upright member 21 is freely<br>
rotatable on the bearings 22 and 23 with respect to the bolt 17, to the first upright<br>
member 16 and to the fork 13.<br>
Welded or otherwise attached to the cylindrical wall of the second upright member 21<br>
is a frame member 24 of a trolley or other load bearing object.<br>
Grease seals 25 are provided on bearings 20, 22 and 23 and a dust cap (not shown)<br>
may be mounted on the top of the bearing assembly.<br>
It will therefore be seen that the fork 13, the first upright member 16 and the second<br>
upright member 21 are all freely rotatable relative to one another thus providing<br>
entirely free rotation of the castor with respect to the frame member 24.<br>
If required, the upright axes of rotation of the first upright member 16 and the second<br>
upright member 21 may be displaced by the interposition of a horizontal plate attached<br>
to one or other of the upright members and rotatable with respect to the other such<br>
upright member upon a thrust bearing or the like. Preferably, however, all axes of<br>
rotation are aligned thus ensuring complete freedom of rotary movement of the<br>
respective parts of the assembly.<br>
Referring to Fig. 2, the thrust bearing 15 of the aforementioned embodiment is omitted<br>
and replaced by a casing 30 fixed by welding to the top of the fork 31, and in which is<br>
located first and second journal bearings 32 and 33 having, respectively, inner and<br>
outer races 321, 32b and 33a, 33b. The head of a bolt 34 bears against the bottom<br>
surface of inner race 32a and the shank passes upwardly through the entire bearing<br>
assembly to be secured by a self-locking nut 35.<br>
Third and fourth bearings 36 and 37 located in a sleeve 38 replace the assembly of<br>
parts 22, 23 and 21 of Fig. 1. Spacers 39 support the inner races of the bearings within<br>
the assembly.<br>
In this embodiment, therefore, the fork 31 is freely rotatable on journal bearings 32 and<br>
33 with respect to the bolt 34, as is sleeve 38 on journal bearings 36 and 37 with<br>
respect to bolt 34 and fork 31. Bolt 34 is similarly rotatable independently. Once<br>
again, a leg or frame member 40 of a trolley or other object may be attached by<br>
welding or other means, to the sleeve 38. A dust cap 41 may be fitted to the top of<br>
sleeve 38.<br>
In the embodiments of Figs. 1 and 2, the trolley or the like mounted on or connected to<br>
sleeve 21 or 38 is manoeuvrable on two or more bearings which interact in series to<br>
afford the castor entirely free rotational movement which does not rely on a single<br>
thrust bearing as typically found in conventional castors where movement can be<br>
inhibited by wear of the axial load-bearing races.<br>
Considerably improved stability and free manoeuvrability are afforded by a castor<br>
made in accordance with the invention.<br>
