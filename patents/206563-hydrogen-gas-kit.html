Hydrogen Gas Kit<br>
Mr.  SHIVA JI MARUTI  DEGAONKAR C/5,  Nava   Samaj Co-operative Housing   Society Limited, Gujarati  Society Road, Off Nehru  Road, Vile Parle   (East), MUM BAI-400  057,<br>
Maharashtra  State,  India.<br>
INDIAN<br>
The  following   specification particularly describes and ascertains  the  nature of  this invention and  the manner in which  it is to be   performed;-<br><br><br>
ORIGINAL<br>
709/MUMNP/2000<br><br>
	GARNTED<br>
      8-12-2004<br><br>
This invention relates to the Hydrogen gas kit, herein¬after called the kit.<br>
Field of invention. (A) The kit of this invention comprises Hydrogen gas generator - stainless steel tank-A, fitted with related accessories, in which a mild chemical reaction takes place between ferrous/non-ferrous metal/oxide scrap and a dilute acid or an alkali, filled in it, as required, and Hydrogen gas is produced, as and when required, as  a fuel, for use, instead of conventional fuels, i.e. Hydrogen gas on demand. There is no need of a compressed Hydrogen gas cylinder, which is obviously unsafe like any other compressed gas cylinder like, L.P.G., C.N.G., L.N.G.i compressed Hydrogen gas costs about Rs. 1750.00 per kg. at present which is absolutely uneconomical. The bye-products of the chemical reaction are also valuable for industrial and Agricultural uses or they can be recycled. Thus the kit is quite practicable, safe and also economical. Examples :-<br>
(A)	ferrous metal scrap + dilute sulphuric acid s<br>
ferrous sulphate + Hydrogen gas, or<br>
fe + H2S04 = feSO^ + H2<br>
(S)    non-ferrous metal scrap + dilute alkali = sodium zincate + Hydrogen gas, or, zn + 2Na0H = Na2Zn02 + H2, etc. ,<br>
(C)    Hydrogen + Oxygen -  water, or 2H2 + 02 -  2H20<br>
(combustion)<br>
This indicates burning of Hydrogen gas as a fuel, produces water, therefore there fs no pollution. However, all other fuels, whether solid, liquid or gaseous, including L.P.G., C.N.G., L.N.G., cause atmospheric pollution, the fuels being Hydrocarbons.<br>
The kit is thus radically Innovative, practicable, safe and economical.<br>
(B)	The kit also comprises Hydrogen gas generator-stainless<br>
steel tank-B, irr which Electrolysis of a conductive water,<br>
filled in it, takes place and Hydrogen gas is produced<br><br><br>
at the negative electrode; the battery regulator connected to the accelerator of the engine of an automobile, produces Hydrogen as a fuel, as and when and as much required, so that the automobile can be accelerated as required; when the battery is switched off, the production of Hydrogen gas stops and also the engine. There is no need of a compressed Hydrogen gas cylinder. The kit is thus radically innovative, practicable, safe and very economical.<br>
Background of the prior art :-<br>
State-of-the-art technology known comprises C.N.G./L.N.G./L.P.G. compressed cylinder kit, fitted to the floor of the boot of the car or an automobile and in continuation, gas pipe-line from the cylinder, fitted with a battery operated solenoid valve, a main valve, a regulator, a pressure gauge and In continuation, the pipe-line, being  fitted to the air cleaner of the engine of the car, through the main valve being fitted to the chassis of the engine of the car, etc., the handle of the main valve being fitted to the accelerator of the engine of an automobile, the engine can be accelerated as required.<br>
The established prior art, however, has many imperfections and design defects which are clearly pinpointed as follows :-<br>
1.	Compressed gas cylinder of C.N.G./L.N.G./L.P.G.<br>
A highly compressed fuel gas cylinder is obviously unsafe, and at times dangerous, in case of an accident, causing loss of human lives and property, whereas this kit or invention, incorporates only a tank in which Hydrogen gas, as a fuel, is produced as and when required i.e., Hydrogen gas on demand. The gas is produced for simultaneous or on-line use; no storage of compressed Hydrogen gas is necessary;  it is thus much safer and better inall respects. However, Hydrogen gas kit works on non-compressed Hydrogen gas fuel technology. Practical advantages are very obvious.<br>
2.	Leakage :  A highly compressed gas cylinder and the<br>
entire kit, Is susceptible or liable to leakage, but<br>
this Invention or the kit being a non-pressure device,<br>
is not liable to leakage, hence safer.<br><br><br>
3.  Pollution : C.N.G./L.P.G., being a Hydro-carbon, when used as a fuel, Invariably produces or exhausts carbon-dioxide and to some extent, carbon-mono-oxide- a poisonous gas, sulphur-dioxide, nitrogen oxides and particulate matter, which are  all health hazards and cause atmospheric pollution; however, there Is no pollution, when Hydrogen gas is used as a fuel, as the product of combustion or exhaust is water :- 2H202 a 2H20.<br>
4.  Heating pad : There Is a provision for heating L.P.G. cylinder which consumes power of the automobile battery; however, the tank of the kit, does not need a heating pad, the boiling point of Hydrogen being -252#75* C or 20.lfOBK.<br>
5.  Corrosion t    L.P.G./C.N.G. cylinder Is made of general<br>
purpose steel, which is susceptible or liable for atmospheric corrosion or rusting, however, the kit comprises a stainless steel tank, which is not liable to rusting, hence safer and better.<br>
6.	Ignition point : The ignition point of L.P.G./C.N.G. Is much lower than that of Hydrogen gas, hence Hydrogen gas is safer.<br>
7.	Technology : L.P.G./ C.N.G. works on four - stroke engine but Hydrogen gas works on two-stroke engine also, with efficiency,hence, practically double power Is available without pollution, when the existing four-stroke engines will be converted to two-stroke ones.<br>
8.	Calorific value : Hydrogen has about 2.50 times more Calorific value than L.P.G./C.N.G.; this means 1 M.T. of Hydrogen gas is needed, instead of 2.50 M.T. of L.P.G./C.N.G.,<br>
9.	Design of main valve : C.N.G./L.P.G. main valve has built-in design or jacket for warming or heating the gas; however, Hydrogen gas kit embodies a simpler and less complicated valve without heating jacket or design, hence not liable<br>
to leakage or maintenance etc., because of less fittings and simpler design. 10.  Safety t    C.N.G./L.P.G. cylinder has neither a pressure gauge nor a safety valve but the tank of the Hydrogen gas kit embodies them, hence much safer.<br><br><br>
in<br><br>
Zinc or aluminium and a dilute acid is related to ferrous metal/ oxide, such as iron; now close the cap; by now, Hydrogen gas production is already started due to a mild reaction in the Tank-A; open the, non jackted regulator and switch on the engine, the solenoid valve automatically opens, Hydrogen gas enters the inlet manifold of the engine, (Hydrogen gas) is sucked in by the inlet stroke of the engine, and the engine starts running on Hydrogen gas as a fuel, the engine can be acceler  ated, as required; depending on the requirement, a litre or so, of a dilute acid or an alkali can be added from time to time, till the scrap is consumed; which takes a long time; periodically drain out the solution in the Tank-A; solution can be sold out as an agricultural pesticide/insecticide or in the form of ferrous sulphate crystals or other ferrous/non-ferrous solutions/ crystals for a variety of uses, as given seperately under uses of the bye-products of this device.<br>
Operation of the Hydrogen gas kit :-<br>
Hydrogen gas Generator-stainless steel Tank-B<br>
2. Open the inlet with cap-3, and fill it with an alkaline, an acidic or salty water or a spent acid or an alkali or a salty water unfit for drinking or a sea water, as required, for conducting a Direct Current (D.C.) from the automobile battery; close the cap-3, open the non jacketed regulator, switch on the engine of the auto, simultaneously the battery operated solenoid valve also opens automatically, and Electrolysis of water starts producing Hydrogen and oxygen gas, which enter the engine being sucked in through the inlet manifold of the engine and the engine starts running on Hydrogen gas, as a fuel; the engine can be accelerated as required; when the batteryris disconnected, the production of the gases also stops and also the engine; when not in use, close the regulator; a dilute acid or an alkali or salty water can be added from time to time, to replenish the consumption of the Electrlyte, as  required.<br><br>
The operation of the kit is comparable to any automobile driving and as such, a specially trained operator or driver Is not needed; this also suits a person of an average intelligence and a skill.<br>
Both the operations are many times satisfactorily tried and tested on my (1) Autorickshawenglne, (2) Petrol car, (3) Rented Petro/Olesel, pumps, (4) Power Generators, (5) Scooters, (6) Diesel pumps, etc.<br>
