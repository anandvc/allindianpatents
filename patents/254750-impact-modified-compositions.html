In one embodiment of the invention the polycarbonate comprises at least one bomopolycarbonate, wherein the term "homopolycarbonate" refers to a polycarbonate synthesized using only one type of dihydroxy-substituted aromatic hydrocarbon. In particular embodiments the polycarbonate comprises a bisphenol A homo- or copolycarbonate, wherein the term "copolycarbonate" refers to a polycarbonate synthesized using more than one type of dihydroxy-substituted hydrocarbon, and in particular more than one type of dihydroxy-substituted aromatic hydrocarbon. In another particular embodiment the polycarbonate comprises a linear homopolycarbonate resin derived from bisphenol A. In other embodiments the polycarbonate comprises a blend of at least one first polycarbonate with at least one other polymeric resin, examples of which include, but are not limited to, a second polycarbonate differing from said first polycarbonate either in structural units or in molecular weight or in both these parameters, or a polyester, or an addition polymer such as acrylonitriJe-styrene-acrylate copolymer.<br>
In various embodiments the weight average molecular weight of the polycarbonate ranges from about 5,000 to about 200,000. In other particular embodiments the weight average molecular weight of the polycarbonate resin is in one embodiment from about 10,000 to about 200,000 grams per mole ("g/mol"), in another embodiment from about 17,000 to about 100,000 g/mol, in another embodiment from about 18,000 to about 80,000 g/mol, in another embodiment from about 18,000 to about 40,000 g/mol; in still another embodiment from about 18,000 to about 36,000 g/mol, in still another embodiment from about 18,000 to about 30,000 g/mol, and in still another embodiment from about 18,000 to about 23,000 g/mol, all as determined by gel permeation chromatography relative to polystyrene standards. In other embodiments the weight average molecular weight of the polycarbonate ranges from about 28,000 to about 36,000 g/mol. Suitable polycarbonate resins exhibit an intrinsic viscosity in one embodiment of about 0.1 to about 1.5 deciliters per gram, in another embodiment of about 0.35 to about 0.9 deciliters per gram, in another embodiment of<br>
about 0.4 to about 0.6 deciliters per gram, and in still another embodiment of about 0.48 to about 0.54 deciliters per gram, all measured in methylene chloride at 25°C.<br>
In a polycarbonate-containing blend there may an improvement in melt flow and/or other physical properties when one molecular weight grade of a polycarbonate is combined with a proportion of a relatively lower molecular weight grade of similar polycarbonate. Therefore, the present invention encompasses compositions comprising only one molecular weight grade of a polycarbonate and also compositions comprising two or more molecular weight grades of polycarbonate. When two or more molecular weight grades of polycarbonate are present, then the weight average molecular weight of the lowest molecular weight polycarbonate is in one embodiment about 10% to about 95%, in another embodiment about 40% to about 85%, and in still another embodiment about 60% to about 80% of the weight average molecular weight of the highest molecular weight polycarbonate. In one representative, non-limiting embodiment polycarbonate-containing blends include those comprising a polycarbonate with weight average molecular weight between about 18,000 and about 23,000 combined with a polycarbonate with weight average molecular weight between about 28,000 and about 36,000 (in all cases relative to polystyrene standards). When two or more molecular weight grades of polycarbonate are present, the weight ratios of the various molecular weight grades may range from about 1 to about 99 parts of one molecular weight grade and from about 99 to about 1 parts of any other molecular weight grades. In some embodiments a mixture of two molecular weight grades polycarbonate is employed, in which case the weight ratios of the two grades may range in one embodiment from about 99:1 to about 1:99, in another embodiment from about 80:20 to about 20:80, and in still another embodiment from about 70:30 to about 50:50. Since not all manufacturing processes for making a polycarbonate are capable of making all molecular weight grades of that constituent, the present invention encompasses compositions comprising two or more molecular weight grades of polycarbonate in which each polycarbonate is made by a different manufacturing process. In one particular embodiment the instant invention encompasses compositions comprising a polycarbonate made by an interfacial process<br><br>
in combination with a polycarbonate of different weight average molecular weight made by a melt process.<br>
The amount of polycarbonate present in the compositions of the present invention is in one embodiment in a range of between about 5 wt.% and about 95 wt.%, in another embodiment in a range of between about 20 wt.% and about 85 wt.%, and in still another embodiment in a range of between about 25 wt.% and about 80 wt.%, based on the weight of the entire composition.<br>

To prepare the rubber modified thermoplastic resin used in the invention, monomers are polymerized in the presence of the rubber substrate to thereby form a graft copolymer, at least a portion of which is chemically grafted to the rubber phase. Any portion of graft copolymer not chemically grafted to rubber substrate comprises the rigid thermoplastic phase. The rigid thermoplastic phase comprises a thermoplastic polymer or copolymer mat exhibits a glass transition temperature (Tg) in one embodiment of greater than about 25°C, in another embodiment of greater than or equal to 90°C, and in still another embodiment of greater than or equal to 100°C.<br>
In a particular embodiment the rigid thermoplastic phase of the rubber modified thermoplastic resin comprises structural units derived from at least one vinyl aromatic monomer, at least one monoethylenically unsaturated nitrile monomer, and at least one monomer selected from the group consisting of (C1-C12)alkyl- and aryl-(meth)acrylate monomers. Suitable (C1-C12)alkyl- and aryl-(meth)acrylate monomers, vinyl aromatic monomers and monoethylenically unsaturated nitrile monomers include those set forth hereinabove in the description of the rubber substrate. In a particular embodiment the rigid thermoplastic phase comprises a vinyl aromatic polymer having first structural units derived from one or more vinyl<br>
aromatic monomers; second structural units derived from one or more monoethylenically unsaturated nitrile monomers; and third structural units derived from one or more monomers selected from the group consisting of (Ci-Ci2)alkyl- and aryl-(meth)acrylate monomers. Suitable vinyl aromatic polymers comprise at least about 20 wt.% structural units derived from one or more vinyl aromatic monomers. Examples of such vinyl aromatic polymers include, but are not limited to, styrene/acrylonitrile/methyl methacrylate copolymer, alpha-methylstyrene/acrylonitrile/methyl methacrylate copolymer and styrene/alpha-methylstyrene/acrylonitrile/methyl methacrylate copolymer. These copolymers may be used for the rigid thermoplastic phase either individually or as mixtures.<br>
When structural units in copolymers are derived from one or more monoethylenically unsaturated nitrile monomers, then the nitrile monomer content in the copolymer comprising the graft copolymer and the rigid thermoplastic phase may be in one embodiment in a range of between about 5 and about 40 percent by weight, in another embodiment in a range of between about 5 and about 30 percent by weight, in another embodiment in a range of between about 10 and about 30 percent by weight, and in yet another embodiment in a range of between about 15 and about 30 percent by weight, based on the weight of the copolymer comprising the graft copolymer and the rigid thermoplastic phase.<br>
The amount of grafting that takes place between the rubber phase and monomers comprising the rigid thermoplastic phase of the rubber modified thermoplastic resin varies with the relative amount and composition of the rubber phase. In one embodiment, greater than about 10 wt.% of the rigid thermoplastic phase is chemically grafted to the rubber, based on the total amount of rigid thermoplastic phase in the composition. In another embodiment, greater than about 15 wt.% of the rigid thermoplastic phase is chemically grafted to the rubber, based on the total amount of rigid thermoplastic phase in the composition. In still another embodiment, greater than about 20 wt% of the rigid thermoplastic phase is chemically grafted to the rubber, based on the total amount of rigid thermoplastic phase in the composition. In particular embodiments the amount of rigid thermoplastic phase chemically grafted to the rubber may be in a range of between about 5% and about 90 wt.%; between<br>
about 10% and about 90 wt%; between about 15% and about 85 wt.%; between about 15% and about 50 wt.%; or between about 20% and about 50 wt.%, based on the total amount of rigid thermoplastic phase in the composition. In yet other embodiments, about 40 to 90 wt.% of the rigid thermoplastic phase is free, that is, non-grafted.<br>
The rigid thermoplastic phase of the rubber modified thermoplastic resin may be present in compositions of the invention in one embodiment at a level of from about 85 to about 6 percent by weight; in another embodiment at a level of from about 65 to about 6 percent by weight; in another embodiment at a level of from about 60 to about 20 percent by weight; in another embodiment at a level of from about 75 to about 40 percent by weight, and in still another embodiment at a level of from about 60 to about 50 percent by weight based on the weight of the rubber modified thermoplastic resin. In other embodiments rigid thermoplastic phase may be present in compositions of the invention in a range of between about 90% and about 30 wt.%, based on the weight of the rubber modified thermoplastic resin.<br>
The rigid thermoplastic phase of the rubber modified thermoplastic resin may be formed solely by polymerization carried out in the presence of rubber substrate or by addition of one or more separately polymerized rigid thermoplastic polymers to a rigid thermoplastic polymer that has been polymerized in the presence of the rubber substrate. When at least a portion.of separately synthesized rigid thermoplastic phase . is added to compositions, then the amount of said separately synthesized rigid thermoplastic phase added is in an amount in a range of between about 30 wt. % and about 80 wt. % based on the weight of the rubber modified thermoplastic resin. Two or more different rubber substrates each possessing a different number average particle size may be separately employed in such a polymerization reaction and then the products blended together. In illustrative embodiments wherein such products each possessing a different number average particle size of initial rubber substrate are blended together, then the ratios of said substrates may be in a range of about 90:10 to about 10:90, or in a range of about 80:20 to about 20:80, or in a range of about 70:30 to about 30:70. In some embodiments an initial rubber substrate with smaller particle size is the major component in such a blend containing more than one particle size of initial rubber substrate.<br><br>
The rigid thermoplastic phase of the rubber modified thermoplastic resin may be made according to known processes, for example, mass polymerization, emulsion polymerization, suspension polymerization or combinations thereof, wherein at least a portion of the rigid thermoplastic phase is chemically bonded, i.e., "grafted" to the rubber phase via reaction with unsaturated sites present in the rubber phase. The grafting reaction may be performed in a batch, continuous or semi-continuous process. Representative procedures include, but are not limited to, those taught in U.S. Patent Nos. 3,944,631; and U.S. patent application Serial No. 08/962,458, filed October 31, 1997. The unsaturated sites in the rubber phase are provided, for example, by residual unsaturated sites in those structural units of the rubber that were derived from a graftlinking monomer.<br>
In some embodiments of the present invention the rubber modified thermoplastic resin is made by a process which comprises monomer grafting to rubber substrate with concomitant formation of rigid thermoplastic phase, which process is performed in stages wherein at least one first monomer is grafted to rubber substrate followed by at least one second monomer different from said first monomer. In the present context the change from one graft stage to the next is defined as that point where there is a change in the identity of at least one monomer added to the rubber substrate for grafting. In one embodiment of the present invention formation of rigid thermoplastic phase and grafting to rubber substrate are performed by feeding at least one first monomer over time to a reaction mixture comprising rubber substrate. In this context a second graft stage occurs when at least one different monomer is introduced into the feed stream in the presence or absence of at least one first monomer.<br>
At least two stages are employed for grafting, although additional stages may be employed. The first graft stage is performed with one or more monomers comprising vinyl aromatic monomers, monoethylenically unsaturated nitrile monomers, and optionally (C1-C12)alkyl- and aryl-(meth)acrylate monomers. In a particular embodiment grafting is performed in a first stage with a mixture of monomers, at least one of which is selected from the group consisting of vinyl aromatic monomers and at least one of which is selected from the group consisting of monoethylenically unsaturated nitrile monomers. When a mixture comprising at least one vinyl aromatic<br>
monomer and at least one monoethylenically unsaturated nitrile monomer is employed in the first graft stage, then the wt./wt. ratio of vinyl aromatic monomer to monoethylenically unsaturated nitrile monomer is in one embodiment in a range of between about 1:1 and about 6:1, in another embodiment in a range of between about 1.5:1 and about 4:1, in still another embodiment in a range of between about 2:1 and about3:l, and in still another embodiment in a range of between about 2.5:1 and about 3:1. In one preferred embodiment the wt./wt. ratio of vinyl aromatic monomer to monoethylenically unsaturated nitrile monomer employed in the first graft stage is about 2.6:1. '<br>
In at least one subsequent stage following said first stage, grafting is performed with one or more monomers comprising vinyl aromatic monomers, monoethylenically unsaturated nitrile monomers, and optionally (C1-C12)alkyl- and aryl-(meth)acrylate monomers. In a particular embodiment grafting is performed in at least one subsequent stage with one or more monomers, at least one of which is selected from the group consisting of (C1-C12)alkyl- and aryl-(meth)acrylate monomers. In another particular embodiment grafting is performed in at least one subsequent stage with a mixture of monomers, at least one of which is selected from the group consisting of (C1-C12)alkyl- and aryl-(meth)acrylate monomers and at least one of which is selected from the group consisting of vinyl aromatic monomers and monoethylenically unsaturated nitrile monomers. In another particular embodiment grafting is performed in at least one subsequent stage with a mixture of monomers, one of which is selected from the group consisting of (CC1-C12)alkyl- and aryl-(meth)acrylate monomers; one of which is selected from the group consisting of vinyl aromatic monomers and one of which is selected from the group consisting of monoethylenically unsaturated nitrile monomers. Said(C1-C12alkyl- and aryl-(meth)acrylate monomers, vinyl aromatic monomers and monoethyleru'oally unsaturated nitrile monomers include those described hereinabove.<br>
In the first graft stage the total amount of monomer employed for grafting to rubber substrate is in one embodiment in a range of between about 5 wt.% and about 98 wt.%; in another embodiment in a range of between about 5 wt.% and about 95 wt.%; in another embodiment in a range of between about 10 wt.°/c and about 90 wt.%; in<br>
another embodiment in a range of between about 15 wt.% and about 85 wt%; in another embodiment in a range of between about 20 wt.% and about 80 wt.%; and in yet another embodiment in a range of between about 30 wt.% and about 70 wt.%, based on the total weight of monomer employed for grafting in all stages. In one particular embodiment the total amount of monomer employed for grafting to rubber substrate hi the first stage is in a range of between about 30 wt.% and about 95 wt.% based on the total weight of monomer employed for grafting in all stages. Further monomer is then grafted to rubber substrate in one or more stages following said first stage. In one particular embodiment all further monomer is grafted to rubber substrate hi one second stage following said first stage.<br>
At least one (C1-C12)alkyl- and aryl-(meth)acrylate monomer is employed for grafting to rubber substrate hi either a first stage, or in a second stage, or in both a first and a second stage of grafting monomers to rubber substrate. The total amount of said (meth)acrylate monomer employed is in one embodiment in a range of between about 95 wt% and about 2 wt.%; hi another embodiment in a range of between about 80 wt% and about 2 wt.%; in another embodiment in a range of between about 70 wt.% and about 2 wt.%; in another embodiment in a range of between about 50 wt.% and about 2 wt.%; in another embodiment in a range of between about 45 wt.% and about 2 wt.%; and hi yet another embodiment in a range of between about 45 wt.% and about 5 wt.%, based on the total weight of all monomers employed for grafting.   In other embodiments of the invention the total amount of said (meth)acrylate monomer employed is in a range of between about 48 wt.% and about 18 wt.%.<br>
In a mixture of monomers comprising at least one (C1-C12alkyl- and aryl-(meth)acrylate monomer, the wt./wt. ratio of said (meth)acrylate monomer to the totality of other monomers employed for grafting to rubber substrate in any particular stage is hi one embodiment in a range of between about 10:1 and about 1:10; in another embodiment in a range of between about 8:1 and about 1:8; in another embodiment hi a range of between about 5:1 and about 1:5; in another embodiment in a range of between about 4:1 and about 1:4; hi another embodiment hi a range of between about 3:1 and about 1:3; hi another embodiment in a range of between about<br>
