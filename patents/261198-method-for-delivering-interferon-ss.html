CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
[001]   This application claims priority to United States Serial No. 60/643,273 filed January 12,2005. The entire contents of the aforementioned application are incorporated herein.<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION <br>
[002]   This invention relates to a method for storing and delivering Interferon-ß.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[003]   Interferons are single chain polypeptides secreted by most animal cells in response to a variety of inducers, including viruses, mitogens and polynucleotides. Interferons participate in regulation of cell function, and have antiviral, antiproliferative and immunomodulating properties. Native human interferons are classified into three major types: Interferon-α (leukocyte), Interferon-ß (fibroblast) and Interferon-γ (immune). Native Interferon-ß is produced primarily by diploid fibroblast cells and in lesser amounts by lymphoblastoid cells. [004]   Interferon-ß is a glycoprotein. Its genetic nucleic acid and amino acid sequences have been determined. (Houghton et. al., "The Complete Amino Acid Sequence of Human Fibroblast Interferon as Deduced Using Synthetic Oligodeoxyribonucleotide Primers of Reverse Transcriptase," Nucleic Acids Research, 8, pp. 2885-94 (1980); T. Taniguchi et al., "The Nucleotide Sequence of Human Fibroblast DNA," Gene, 10, pp. 11-15 (1980)). Recombinant Interferon-ß has been produced and characterized.<br>
[005]   Interferon-ß exhibits various biological and immunological activities, such as antiviral, anti-tumor and anti-cancer. Interferon-ß-la is approved for sale in the United States for the treatment of multiple sclerosis under the trade name of Avonex®.<br>

[026]   Other features and advantages of the invention will be apparent from the following<br>
detailed description, and from the claims. <br>
Description of the Invention<br>
[027]   In general, the invention provides a method for storing and delivering solutions of interferon-ß such that the concentration of aggregating metal (each metal individually or total of all aggregating metals) is less than 500 parts per billion in the solution after storage, e.g., after storage greater than 10 minutes, 120 minutes, 360 minutes, or 480 minutes. Certain metals cause aggregation of Interferon-ß. For example, as shown in Figure 1, an increasing concentration of the aggregating metal, such as tungsten, increases the degree of aggregation of interferon-ß-1 a.<br>
[028]   Aggregation is undesirable because it causes opalescence, particulate formation and precipitation of the drug. Further, aggregation can lead to a lower bioavailability of the drug and difficulty in delivering the Interferon-ß. The method described herein reduces the amount of aggregating metals released into a stored solution of Interferon-ß to provide less than about 15%, 10%, 5%, or 2% aggregation as measured by size exclusion chromatography.<br>
[029]   The invention also provides a device for retaining a solution of Interferon-ß so that the concentration of aggregating metals (each metal individually or the total of all aggregating metals) is less than 500 parts per billion in the solution after the solution is retained in the device for greater than 10 minutes, 120 minutes, 360 minutes, or 480 minutes. In addition, the device described herein, reduces the amount of aggregating metals released into an<br>
Interferon-ß solution retained within the housing to provide less than about 15%, 10%, 5%, or 2% aggregation.<br>
[030]   Referring to Figures 2 and 3, a glass syringe 10 for delivering Interferon-ß includes a housing 20 for holding Interferon-ß-la and a needle 30 for dispensing Interferon-ß-la from housing 20 (Figure 2). The housing 20 includes a cylindrical wall 22 defining a central bore 24 (Figure 3). One end 26 of the housing connects to needle 30 and the other end 28 of the housing receives a plunger 32. Plunger 32 is disposed in central bore 24 to engage frictionally cylindrical wall 22. During delivery, plunger 32 is depressed to dispense interferon-ß. During storage in syringe 10, an Interferon-ß solution is disposed in central bore    24 of housing 20 and is in physical contact with the end of plunger 32. <br>
[031]   Syringe 10 is constructed or cleaned prior to use to remove or reduce the amount of aggregating metals on the surfaces of the syringe which would contact a solution of Interferon-ß. Generally, syringe 10 is constructed or cleaned prior to use to remove or reduce the amount of aggregating metals, such as iron, copper, nickel, molybdenum or tungsten, released from the surfaces of the syringe that would be in contact with the Interferon-ß solution during storage, e.g., greater than about 10,120, 360, or 480 minutes, about 100,200, 400, 700 or 1000 hours, between about 120 minutes to about 480 minutes, or between about 300 minutes to about 420 minutes of storage at temperatures between 2°C and 30°C. [032]   Syringe 10 is constructed or cleaned such that less than 500, 250,100, 75, 50 or 25 parts per billion of aggregating metals (individually or in total) are released from the syringe into a solution of Interferon-ß after storage. The construction or cleaning of the syringe also provides less than 15%, 10%, 5% or 2% aggregation in an Interferon-ß solution after storage of the solution in the syringe. The amount of aggregating metal released into a solution of Interferon-ß or placebo formulation may be measured by performing Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry or Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy on Interferon-ß solutions or placebo formulations.<br>
[033]   Suitable syringe storage devices capable of providing storage conditions which reduce the percent aggregation and amount of aggregating metal to levels described above are available from Becton Dickinson and Bunder Glas GmbH. Other syringe storage devices are known in the art. For example, see U.S. Patent Nos. 6,352,522; 6,263,641; 4,895,716 and 4,266,557. These devices may be washed with concentrated sulfuric acid, e.g., 98%, to remove aggregating metals followed by one or more basic washes to neutralize any residual sulfuric acid before filling the device with Interferon-ß. After washing the device with the acid and basic solutions, the amount of aggregating metal remaining in the syringe may be<br>
determined by rinsing trie syringe and performing Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry or Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy on a placebo formulation that was stored in the syringe for more than about 10 minutes.<br>
[034]  Although the storage device is described above as a syringe, other devices for storing or delivering Interferon-fi are within the scope of the invention provided that the elements of each device that are in contact with the Interferon-ß for more than about 10 minutes release less than 500 parts per billion of aggregating metals into the solution of Interferon-ß. Each of these devices can be manufactured to reduce the amount of aggregating metals that may release into the stored solutions or the device can be cleaned with acid and basic washes. Examples of other storage devices include ampoules (40, Fig. 4), vials (45, Fig 4) and bags (50, Fig. 4).<br>
[035]   The invention will be further described in the following examples, which do not limit the scope of the invention described in the claims.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
Example 1 - General Procedure for Determination of Aggregating Metal Release:<br>
[036]   The following procedure can be used to determine the amount of aggregating metals<br>
released into a solution after storage.<br>
[037]   A random selection of containers in which Interferon-fi is to be stored is selected from<br>
a manufacturing lot. Each container in the random selection is filled with a placebo<br>
formulation including all of the components of the formulation except Interferon-ß. The<br>
filled containers are stored at ambient temperature for a period of about greater than 360<br>
minutes. The placebo formulations are analyzed by any suitable means to determine the<br>
concentration of aggregating metals. Suitable analytical methods include, but are not limited<br>
to, Inductively Coupled Mass Spectrometry and Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy. <br>
Example 2 - Determination of Aggregating Metal Release from Avonex®: <br>
[038]   Avonex® liquid formulation contains Interferon-ß-1 a, sodium acetate trihydrate, glacial acetic acid, arginine hydrochloride and polysorbate-20 in Water For Injection (WFI). Specifically, each 0.5 mL (30 meg dose) of Avonex® in a prefilled glass syringe contains 30 meg of Interferon-ß-la, 0.79 mg sodium acetate trihydrate, 0.25 mg glacial acetic acid, 15.8 mg arginine hydrochloride and 0.025 mg polysorbate-20 in WFI at a pH of approximately 4.8. The placebo formulation is prepared by combining each of the components of the<br>
Avonex® formulationl finus the interferon-ß-la. Examples of formulations of Interferon-ß are described in International Publication No. WO 98/28007 the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference. A random sample of syringes, such as 60, from a manufacturing lot is selected to evaluate the amount of aggregating metals released into stored solutions. The syringes are filled with the placebo formulation and stored for a period of between 360 to 480 minutes, optionally with sonication for about 5 minutes at room temperature. A sample of the placebo formulation is analyzed by Inductively Coupled Mass Spectrometry to determine the amount of aggregating metals.<br>
