COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10 and Rule 13]<br>
"AN INTAKE APPARATUS FOR AN ENGINE TO PRODUCE A SWIRL IN A COMBUSTION CHAMBER"<br>
HONDA GIKEN KOGYO KABUSHIKI KAISHA, a corporation of Japan, having a place of business at 1-1, Minamiaoyama 2-chome, Minato-ku, Tokyo, Japan,<br>
The   following   specification   particularly  describes   the   nature   of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br><br><br>
GRANTED<br><br>
               8 MAR 2006<br><br>
[Detailed Description of the Invention]<br>
[Technical Field to Which the Invention Pertains]<br>
This invention relates to an intake apparatus for an engine, and more particularly to improvements in an intake apparatus for an engine wherein a intake port shaped so as to produce a swirl in a combustion chamber to which a top portion of a piston fitted for sliding movement in a cylinder bore is exposed is provided on a cylinder head and a valve seat in the form of a ring disposed at an inner end of the intake port is securely provided on the cylinder head at a position displaced from the center of the combustion chamber while a stem of an intake valve having a valve head portion which can be seated on the valve seat is fitted for sliding movement in a guide cylinder provided in the cylinder head coaxially with the valve seat.<br>
[Prior Art]<br>
Conventionally, an intake apparatus of the type mentioned is already known from the official gazette of Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. Hei 4-17707 and so forth, and a spiral intake port is provided in a cylinder head such that it is communicated at an inner end thereof with a circular intake valve opening formed from a valve seat.<br><br>
[Problem to be Solved by the Invention]<br>
In the conventional intake apparatus described above, such a whirling flow that whirls around a stem of an intake valve is formed in an inner end portion of an intake port on the back side of a valve head portion of the intake valve, and power of intake air fuel mixture produced at an upstream side straight portion of the intake port is used for turning force in a small radius around the stem and causes a significant drop of the flow rate of the air fuel mixture which flows from the intake port into the combustion chamber.  Further, when the intake valve is opened, the air fuel mixture whirling on the back side of the valve head portion of the intake pipe flows in a direction of an axial line of the cylinder into the combustion chamber, and since the whirling direction and the intake direction into the combustion chamber are different from each other, it is difficult to raise the intake air flow rate of the air fuel mixture into the combustion chamber, resulting in insufficient formation of a swirl in the combustion chamber.<br><br>
The present invention has been made in such a situation as described above, and it is an object of the<br><br><br>
present invention to provide an intake apparatus for an engine which allows a stronger swirl flow to be formed in a combustion chamber.<br>
[Means for Solving the Problem]<br>
In order to attain the object described above, according to the present invention as set forth in claim 1, an intake apparatus for an engine wherein a intake port shaped so as to produce a swirl in a combustion chamber to which a top portion of a piston fitted for sliding movement in a cylinder bore is exposed is provided on a cylinder head and a valve seat in the form of a ring disposed at an inner end of the intake port is securely provided on the cylinder head at a position displaced from the center of the combustion chamber while a stem of an intake valve having a valve head portion which can be seated on the valve seat is fitted for sliding movement in a guide cylinder provided in the cylinder head coaxially with the valve seat is characterized in that the intake port on a projection drawing on a plane perpendicular to an axial line of the cylinder bore is formed in a shape wherein the intake port has a first path portion extending in a tangential direction to the guide cylinder on the outer side with<br><br><br>
respect to the guide cylinder and a tapering second path portion contiguous to the first path portion and curved so as to wind part of the guide cylinder, and an opposing wall which covers the valve head portion of the intake valve and the valve seat except a portion which overlaps with the first and second path portions on the projection drawing is provided on the cylinder head in an opposing relationship to part of the valve head portion and the valve seat.<br><br>
With such a configuration as described above, the intake port on a projection drawing on a plane perpendicular to the axial line of the cylinder bore is formed in a shape wherein the intake port has a first path portion extending in a tangential direction to the guide cylinder and a tapering second path portion curved so as to wind part of the guide cylinder, and the valve head portion of the intake valve and the valve seat are covered with the opposing wall except the portion which overlaps with the intake port on the projection drawing. Consequently, air fuel mixture having been introduced by the intake port is taken into the combustion chamber in such a manner as to wind part of the outer periphery of a stem provided on the intake valve, but the air fuel<br><br>
mixture is not whirled in the intake port.  Therefore, the air fuel mixture can be introduced into the combustion chamber while preventing a drop of the flow rate thereby to form a strong swirl in the combustion chamber.  Besides, since the intake port is required only to be shaped so as to pass air fuel mixture smoothly therethrough, the path resistance in the intake port can be suppressed low.<br><br>
Further, the invention as set forth in claim 2 is characterized, in addition to the configuration of the invention given above as set forth in claim 1, in that the shape of the second path portion on the projection drawing is formed in a shape wherein the second path portion intersects with a straight line which interconnects the center of the combustion chamber and the center of the guide cylinder. With such a configuration as just described, production of a flow of air fuel mixture which flows from the intake port into the combustion chamber in a direction opposite to that of a swirl flow produced in the combustion chamber can be prevented with certainty.  Consequently, the swirl in the combustion chamber can be made further strong. <br>
Furthermore, the invention as set forth in claim 3<br><br>
is characterized, in addition to the configuration of the invention given above, in that an inner side face of the intake port at a portion corresponding to an inner side outer profile line of the second path portion is formed by a vertical wall provided on the cylinder head perpendicularly to the opposing wall. With such a configuration as just described, the intake port can be inclined so that the intake range of air fuel mixture into the combustion chamber is defined accurately and the angle with respect to the plane perpendicular to the cylinder axial line may be smaller, and consequently, the swirl flow in the combustion chamber can be made further strong.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention relates to an intake apparatus for an engine wherein an intake port is formed so as to produce a swirl in a combustion chamber to which a top portion of a piston fitted for sliding movement in a cylinder bore is exposed that is provided on a cylinder head and a valve seat in the form of a ring disposed at an inner end of said intake port is securely provided on said cylinder head at a position displaced from the center of said combustion chamber while a stem of an intake valve having a valve head portion which is seated on said valve seat is fitted for sliding movement in a guide cylinder provided in said cylinder head coaxially with said valve seat, characterized in that said intake port perpendicular to an axial line of said cylinder bore is formed wherein said intake port has a first path portion extending in a tangential direction to said guide cylinder on the outer side with respect to said guide cylinder and a tapering second path portion contiguous to said first path portion and curved so as to wind part of said guide cylinder, and an opposing wall which covers said valve head portion of said intake valve and said valve seat except a portion which overlaps with said first and second path portions is provided on said cylinder head in an opposing relationship to part of said valve head portion and said valve seat.<br><br><br>

Besides, since the engine E is carried on the body frame 15 such that the axial line of the cylinder bore 44 thereof extends substantially horizontally and the intake port 70 is disposed at a side wall of an upper portion of the cylinder head 39, in the combustion chamber 45, the<br><br><br>
ignition plug 49 having a lower heating value is disposed immediately below the opening end of the intake port 70 to the combustion chamber 45, that is, the intake valve 74.<br><br>
By the way, the intake port 70 has such a shape that it produces a swirl in the combustion chamber 45, and is formed in such a shape on a projection drawing on a plane perpendicular to the axial line of the cylinder bore 44 that the intake port 70 has, as shown in FIG. 7, a first path portion 70a which extends in a tangential direction to the guide cylinder 98 on the outer side of the guide cylinder 98, and a tapering second path portion 70b contiguous to the first path portion 70a and curved in such a manner as to wind part of the guide cylinder 98. <br>
The first path portion 70a extends linearly in a tangential direction to the guide cylinder 98 perpendicularly to a straight line 102 which interconnects, for example, the center CI of the combustion chamber 45 and the center C2 of the guide cylinder 98.  The second path portion 70b is formed in such a curved shape that it winds part of the guide cylinder 98 without intersecting with the straight line<br><br>
102 on the projection drawing mentioned above.<br>
Referring also to FIG. 8, on the cylinder head 39, an opposing wall 39a (indicated by slanting lines in FIG. 7) which covers the valve head portion 74a of the intake valve 74 and the valve seat 97 except a portion which overlaps with the first and second path portions 70a, 70b of the intake port 70 is provided in an opposing relationship to part of the valve head portion 74a and the valve seat 97.  In particular, a portion of the valve seat 97 which is disposed in the form of a ring at the inner end of the intake port 70 functions as a substantial intake valve opening 103, and the intake valve opening 103 which is a region other than the portion of the valve seat 97 which is covered with the opposing wall 39a is opened when the intake valve 74 is opened.<br><br>
An inner side face of the intake port 70 at a portion corresponding to an inner side outer profile line which defines the second path portion 70b is formed from a vertical wall 39b (refer to FIG. 5) provided on the cylinder head 39 perpendicularly to the opposing wall 39a. <br><br>
Now, operation of the present embodiment is described.  The intake port 70 on the projection drawing on the plane perpendicular to the axial line of the cylinder bore 44 is formed in a shape which has the first path portion 70a extending in a tangential direction to the guide cylinder 98 on the outer side of the guide cylinder 98 and the tapering second path portion 70b contiguous to the first path portion 70a and curved in such a manner as to wind part of the guide cylinder 98, and the valve head portion 74a of the intake valve 74 and the valve seat 97 are covered with the opposing wall 39a of the cylinder head 39 except the portion which overlaps with the first and second path portions 70a, 70b on the projection drawing.<br>
Accordingly, air fuel mixture having been introduced by the intake port 70 is taken into the combustion chamber 45 in such a manner that it winds part of the outer periphery of the stem 74b provided on the intake valve 74, but the air fuel mixture is not whirled in the intake port 70.  Therefore, the air fuel mixture can be introduced into the combustion chamber 45 while preventing a drop of the flow rate, and a strong swirl can be formed in the combustion chamber 45.  Besides,<br><br>
since the intake port 70 is required only to be shaped so as to pass air fuel mixture smoothly therethrough, the path resistance in the intake port 70 can be suppressed low.<br>
Further, since the cylinder head 39 which forms a wall at an end of the second path portion 70b on the projection drawing mentioned hereinabove is formed in a shape wherein it does not intersect with the straight line 102 which interconnects the center C1 of the combustion chamber 45 and the center C2 of the guide cylinder 98, production of a flow of air fuel mixture which flows from the intake port 70 into the combustion chamber 45 in a direction opposite to that of a swirl flow produced in th.e combustion chamber 45 can be prevented with certainty.  Consequently, the swirl in the combustion chamber 45 can be made further strong.<br>
Furthermore, since the inner side face of the intake port 70 at the portion corresponding to the inner side outer profile line of the second path portion 70b is formed from the vertical wall 39b provided on the cylinder head 39 perpendicularly to the opposing wall 39a, the intake port 70 can be inclined so that the intake<br><br><br>
I<br><br>
range of air fuel mixture into the combustion chamber 45 is defined accurately and the angle with respect to the plane perpendicular to the cylinder axial line may be smaller, and consequently, the swirl flow in the combusti on chamber 45 can be made further strong.<br>
By the way, vhile a plurality of, for example, a pair of ignition plugs 49, 50 are attached to the cylinder head 39 in such a manner as to be exposed to the combustion chamber 45 in a free space other than the intake valve 74 and the exhaust valve 75 in order to achieve reduction of the fuel cost and augmentation of the character of exhaust gas, the heating values of the ignition plugs 49, 50 are set different from each other, and the heating value of the ignition plug 49 which is positioned nearer to the intake port 70 along the flowing direction 101 of the swirl in the combustion chamber 45 is set lower than the heating value of the ignition plug 50 which is positioned farther from the intake port 70. <br>
In particular, while the heating value of the ignition plug 50 which is exposed to combustion gas of a comparatively high temperature by combustion of air fuel mixture which has become comparatively lean as a result<br><br>
of progress of evaporation and diffusion of the air fuel mixture in the combustion chamber 45 is set comparatively high, the heating value of the ignition plug 49 which may possibly be cooled by contact with comparatively rich air fuel mixture introduced into the combustion chamber 45 from the intake port 70 is set comparatively low. Consequently, occurrence of failure in ignition at the ignition plug 49 by smoking can be prevented.<br>
Further, since the engine body 37 is carried on the body frame 15 in a posture wherein the cylinder axial line extends substantially horizontally and the intake port 70 is provided in the cylinder head 39 in such a manner that it is opened in the combustion chamber 45 above the ignition plug 49 at which the heating value is lowest, even if fuel running along the inner face of a lower portion of the intake port 70 without being atomized flows into the combustion chamber 45, since the heating value of the ignition plug 49 with which the fuel may possibly contact is lowest between the ignition plugs 49, 50, occurrence of smoking by contact with the fuel which is not in an atomized state can be prevented, and occurrence of failure in firing by smoking at the ignition plug 49 can be prevented.<br><br>
While an embodiment of the present invention is described above, the present invention is not limited to the embodiment described above, and various design alterations can be made without departing from the spirit of the present invention as set forth in the claims.<br>
[Effect of the Invention]<br>
As described above, according to the invention as set forth in claim 1, air fuel mixture can be introduced into the combustion chamber while preventing a drop of the flow rate so that a strong swirl can be formed within the combustion chamber.  Besides, the path resistance in the intake port can be suppressed low.<br><br>
Further, according to the invention as set forth in claim 2, production of a flow of air fuel mixture which flows into the combustion chamber from the intake port in a direction opposite to that of a swirl flow produced in the combustion chamber can be prevented with certainty, and the swirl in the combustion chamber can be made further stronger.<br>
