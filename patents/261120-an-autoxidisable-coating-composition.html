				<td>LOW VOC COATINGS AND PAINTS<br>
The present invention relates to coating compositions which have low emissions and in particular paints with low solvent emissions. The invention is particularly concerned with aqueous based coating compositions especially aqueous based paints although it is equally applicable to transparent coatings such as varnishes and to certain adhesive compositions. The invention further relates to polymers which may be used as binder in such coatings.<br>
Coating compositions, including paints typically comprise a liquid carrier medium and a film forming binder polymer together with other components such as additives including thickeners and for coloured paints, of course, pigments. The liquid carrier can comprise water or organic solvent or indeed a mixture of the two. The binder polymer may be in the form of a dispersion in the carrier liquid, whereby the polymer exists in particulate form or it may be dissolved in the carrier liquid and be a solution.<br>
Aqueous or waterborne paints, by which is meant paints in which the carrier liquid comprises more than 50 wt% water (the remainder being organic liquid), are usually formulated using binder polymers in dispersion, also known as latices. Such paints are often referred to as emulsion paints. Examples of such paints include the matt and silk emulsions. In contrast, solventborne paints are normally formulated using polymers dissolved in organic liquid. Examples of such paint include gloss paints.<br>
A more detailed description of binder polymer types is given later in this specification.<br>
Coating compositions must satisfy certain requirements. For example three important requirements are that they can be readily applied to produce uniform coatings of the desired thickness and that once applied the coatings dry rapidly and harden to produce the required finish.<br>
Paints and coating compositions are typically applied at ambient temperature which, depending upon local conditions, can range from about 3°C to about 40°C. It is important that the coatings dry and harden to form a hard layer and that they do so as quickly as possible. For example where panels and doors are being manufactured it is disadvantageous if, after they have been painted or coated they must stand for extended periods of time to allow the paint or coating to dry and harden before they can be stacked and/or transported. It is equally important when painting in the domestic environment for the<br>
to harden rapidly as this minimises damage to the paint resulting from accidental contact by the occupants.<br>
Usually, in order to form good continuous films when using waterborne emulsion paints formulated using latices it is important that the film forming binder polymer has a low Fox glass transition temperature, (also known as Tg) which is at or below ambient temperature at which the coating or paint is applied. This usually ensures that the minimum temperature at which the binder forms a film (also known as the MFFT) is also below this temperature. However, in order to produce a hard, non-tacky coating, the binder, after application and drying should have a Tg which is at or above the ambient or service temperature.<br>
Known aqueous coating compositions, based on dispersion polymer binders, achieve this by using a hard binder polymer, in which the Tg of the said binder is above ambient, in combination with coalescing/plasticising solvents. The effect of the solvent is to reduce the Tg and MFFT of the binder polymer and hence the coating to below ambient. Once applied to the substrate, the final hardness of the solid coating increases to above ambient temperature by loss of the solvent and/or plasticiser. This occurs naturally as the coating dries or can be accelerated by increasing the temperature and/or raising the airflow.<br>
Known solventborne coatings can be formulated using binder polymers which are capable of autoxidation. This causes crosslinks to form between polymer chains when the liquid coating is exposed to air, in particular oxygen, which in turn increases the Tg and thus hardness of the dried coating after application.<br>
Both of these methods suffer from the disadvantages that loss of the solvent and/or plasticiser during drying results in undesirable volatile organic compounds (VOC's) being emitted to the atmosphere. In addition, the transition from the low Tg during application, either through simple loss of carrier liquid or by autoxidation, to the higher Tg required of the final dried coating can take considerable time during which the paint on the coated surface remains tacky and cannot be touched or used.<br>
The present challenge facing coating and paint formulators is one of formulating coatings and paints with low or no volatile components which also meet challenging performance criteria of ease of application, rapid drying and improved hardness.<br>
Known aqueous paints contain one or more film-forming binder polymers. As a coating of liquid paint dries on a surface, this film-forming binder polymer serves to form a film (i.e. a<br>
coat) which bonds to the surface and also binds together all the non-volatile components of the paint including particularly any opacifiers, pigments and extenders present. A wide variety of conventional film-forming binder polymers are available, but those most commonly used in aqueous architectural paints are of three broad types obtained from mono-ethylenically unsaturated monomers and known colloquially as the "acrylics", the "vinyls" and the "styrenics". The "acrylics" are usually copolymers of at least two alkyl esters of one or more mono-ethylenically unsaturated carboxylic acids (e.g. methyl methacrylate-butyl acrylate copolymer) whilst the "vinyls" usually comprise copolymers of a mono-vinyl ester of a saturated carboxylic acid and at least one of either an acrylic monomer or a different mono-vinyl ester. The "styrenics" are copolymers containing styrene (or a similar mono-vinyl aromatic monomer) together with a copolymerisable monomer which is usually an acrylic.<br>
Such solution or dispersion copolymers useful as film forming binder polymers, whether solvent borne or water borne can be made by well-known solution polymerisation or emulsion polymerisation methods respectively.<br>
As mentioned above, the particles of binder polymer must preferably coalesce to form a substantially continuous film in order for the dried coating to have the necessary properties to protect the substrate. Coalescence can be improved by adding organic so-called "coalescing solvents" to the paint formulation and typical of such organic solvents are ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, benzyl alcohol and the proprietary solvent called "Texanol" which is trimethylpentane diol isobutyrate.<br>
In order to produce coatings and paints that are less damaging to the environment the coating industry has developed the use of aqueous alkyd dispersions, which help in reducing the VOC emissions. The technology utilises low molecular weight alkyds which are dispersed, using surfactants, into water and although this technology is being increasingly used in decorative low emission coatings the time required for the coating to dry and harden is too long and the hardness of the coatings is poor.<br>
Alkyd resins are made by condensation polymerization of dihydric or polyhydric alcohols, polybasic acids and a drying oil glyceride or acid. Typically, the drying-oil glyceride is converted to a monoglyceride, which is then reacted with an acid or acid anhydride to create an alkyd resin. When such resins are applied as coatings, the polymer backbones cross-link by autoxidation. The presence of trace amounts of certain metal salts, such as cobalt naphthenate, can be used as catalysts to speed up the autoxidation process.<br>
European Patent Application 1044993 provides an aqueous dispersion which can be used in a water based coating composition which is free of volatile coalescing agents, and which can cure and harden by autoxidation under ambient conditions to form a continuous protective coating.<br>
The aqueous dispersion of EP 1044993 includes a polymer which is a polymerization product of vinylic monomers, wherein from about 5% to about 90% by weight of the vinylic monomers are selected from co-esters of a drying oil acid and an unsaturated alpha, beta -polymerizable unsaturated carboxylic acid, and from about 0.5% to about 50% by weight, based on the weight of the copolymer, of a hydrophobic ester or partial ester of a drying oil acid and a polyol. 1 to 80% of the copolymer molecules have a molecular weight of 300-3000 and the copolymer dispersion has a gel content of less than 75%. However, the use of the drying oil coester can soften the coating and can also slow down the curing by autoxoidation as is shown by the Examples in EP 1044993 which demonstrate that the systems of EP 1044993 do not have the capability to produce hard films after application and drying even after extended periods of time.<br>
EP 1044993 refers to U.S. Patent 5,750,751 which describes copolymerization of vinylic monomers with glycol co-esters of drying oil acids and alpha, beta -unsaturated polymerizable carboxylic acids using aqueous emulsion polymerization. The glycol co-esters of drying oil acids and alpha, beta -unsaturated polymerizable carboxylic acids, which have both an acrylate functional group and drying oil functionalities, were said to be significantly more reactive than earlier alkyd resins. According to U.S. Patent 5,750,751, the co-polymers it describes did not exhibit any incompatibility problems, formed clear continuous films, and underwent autoxidative cure in the presence of drying catalysts. However, in order to obtain uniformly clear continuous films, the illustrated coating composition in U.S. Patent 5,750,751 contained 10 weight percent on total emulsion or 18 weight percent on the resin non volatile content, of the volatile coalescing solvent, 2-butoxyethanol.<br>
Accordingly there remains a need for coatings that combine good early and final hardness with low solvent emissions and for polymers that may be used in such coatings.<br>
It is therefore an aim of the present invention to provide coating or paint compositions which may be applied from aqueous systems including systems free of organic solvents and / or coalescers to produce films of comparable hardness to solvent based systems and which have a reduced drying time when compared with existing aqueous systems. Although the<br>
IWfcntion provides useful coating systems free of organic solvents it is envisaged that formulators may wish to include solvents and or plasticisers for specific applications.<br>
The present invention provides a coating composition comprising a copolymer dispersion capable of forming a film at or below ambient temperature and capable of curing to form a hard coating at or below ambient temperature and being handleable in less than 4 hours after application said composition containing less than 15% by weight of a volatile organic solvent and/or plasticiser.<br>
In a preferred embodiment the invention provides an autoxidisable coating composition comprising a liquid dispersion medium and a binder wherein the binder comprises an unsaturated copolymer comprising i) at least one unsaturated fatty acid drying oil component and ii) one or more monomers copolymerisable with i) wherein at least 15% by weight of the binder is present as a microgel. More preferably the unsaturated copolymer comprises at least 15% by weight of microgel.<br>
The preferred coating composition contains less than a total of 10%, more preferably less than 5% by weight of a volatile organic solvent and plasticiser, more preferably less than 3% by weight and is preferably free of both materials. The amount of solvent and/or plasticizer to be used may depend upon the Tg of the polymer itself, since the solvent and/or plasticizer has the effect of reducing the Tg and hence more may be required when using polymers of higher Tg. The presence of a solvent and/or plasticizer may be useful to improve the wetting of the substrate and/or the spreadability of the coating composition.<br>
In a further embodiment the invention provides a dispersion of unsaturated copolymer comprising i) at least one unsaturated fatty acid drying oil component and ii) one or more monomers copolymerisable with i) wherein at least 15% by weight of the unsaturated polymer or copolymer is present as a microgel. Preferably, the copolymer is autoxidiseable. Even more preferably the copolymer is as defined in claims 17 to 28.<br>
The term microgel means that the copolymer is insoluble in tetrahydrofuran at 25°C when using 30 ml of tetrahydrofuran per 2 grams of the composition. These microgels may have such a high molecular weight that they will not pass through a Gel Permeation Chromatography column also the copolymers have a maximum calculated Fox Tg of 8°C, preferably a maximum calculated Fox Tg of 5°C. It is also preferred that the microgels containing copolymers have a calculated Fox Tg no lower than -10°C preferably no lower than -5°C. It is preferred that the composition of the present invention containing at least 25%<br>
l, preferably at least 45%, more preferably at least 55% and most preferably at least 75% and up to 95% of microgel. The microgels are formed by crosslinking during the polymerisation reaction used to produce the binder however, they retain sufficient residual unsaturation to enable further crosslinking by autoxidation after application of the coating.<br>
Another beneficial aspect of the present invention is that the microgel particles of the dispersion can be particularly small as compared with the particle size of traditional binder polymers used in coatings. The mean particle size can be up to 1000 nanometers in diameter, preferably from 10 to 1000, more preferably from 20 to 750, even more preferably from 20 to 500, still more preferably from 20 to 250 and most preferably from 100 to 150 nanometers. Dispersions comprising particles below about 20 nanometers can appear transparent and are sometimes referred to as solutions. Particle size is measured using a Malvern Mastersize 2000 .<br>
We have found that the use of smaller particle size binders results in improved film formation perhaps due to increased interparticle interaction and also imparts improved gloss to the coatings perhaps due to the reduced tendency of the particles to scatter light.<br>
Gel content method<br>
About 2 grams of the latex were accurately weighed into a 33ml plastic centrifuge tube that was then filled up with 30 ml tetrahydrofuran and capped. The latex was dissolved by shaking the mixture for half an hour at ambient in a shaker. Centrifugation for two hours at 35,000g allows the gel to settle at the bottom of the tube. The clear liquid was then separated off from the solid/gel blend, which was then dried in the oven first at 500 C for 4 hours followed by another 1 hour at 110°C and subsequently weighed.<br>
The percentage of gel content in the non-volatile latex fraction is defined as follows: (weight of gel/NVweight of sample) x 100     (NV = non volatile)<br>
We have found that the use of these copolymers as binders provides autoxidisable decorative coatings which air dry rapidly at room temperature and harden quickly to give hard, tough, durable, water resistant coatings requiring little if any volatile organic coalescing solvents or low molecular weight plasticisers and which give excellent wear resistance, even at high pigment to volume concentration, PVC and which improves with cure on storage. Preferred coating systems based on these copolymers contain less than 10% by weight of<br>
-QjLanic solvent preferably less than 5% by weight and most preferably 0%. Low levels are preferred as this minimises emissions and unpleasant smells, especially in enclosed spaces. The rapid hardening achieved with these coatings is thought to be due to the partial crosslinking that occurs within the polymer particles during polymerisation and crosslinking of the residual unsaturation in the copolymer by autoxidation after application and exposure to air. The rapid hardness development of the coating is thought to be due to the fact that some crosslinking has taken place prior to the application of the coating.<br>
In a further preferred embodiment the unsaturated fatty acid drying oil component used in the production of the binder copolymer of the present invention contains an autoxidisable fatty acid moiety and may be the diester formed by reacting the unsaturated fatty acid with the oxirane group on an ethylenically unsaturated monomer such as glycidyl acrylate or methacrylate. Such a reaction produces a copolymerisable autoxidisable monomer of hydroxypropylene diester comprising unsaturated long chain fatty acid moiety linked to an unsaturated carboxylic acid ester by the divalent hydroxypropylene group. The unsaturation in the unsaturated carboxylic acid ester is then available for copolymerisation with the other monomers to form the backbone of the macromolecule whilst the unsaturation in the pendant long chain fatty acid derivatives renders the polymer molecule autoxidisable. Preferably the unsaturated fatty acid drying oil component is stored at low temperature to improve its storage stability.<br>
The unsaturated long chain fatty acid is preferably a drying oil unsaturated acid such as the fats and oils used in the paint and coatings industry. The fats and oils normally used in the paints industry are of vegetable and animal origin. They consist in the main of mixed glycerol esters of long chain linear monocarboxylic acids called fatty acids and a number of minor non glyceride components.<br>
In the paints industry oils are split into four different classes, namely - drying oils, semi-drying oils, non-drying oils and chemically modified oils. We prefer to use the drying oils such as linseed oil, tung oil, oiticia oil etc, although the semi-drying oils such as soya bean oil, sunflower seed oil, and tobacco seed oil can also be used. Commercially available "Tall Oil Fatty acid" is the preferred material and in particular the refined tall oil fatty acids containing less than 4% of rosin acids.<br>
The properties of an oil depend largely on the type and proportion of the fatty acids making up the various triglycerides. The fatty acids which occur in natural oils (as glycerides) are either oily liquids or solids with low melting points. They are colourless when pure, and can<br>
•typivided into "saturated" and unsaturated fatty acids. The more commonly occurring ones are listed below:<br>
Saturated<br>
Laurie acid	CH3(CH2)10COOH<br>
Myristic acid	CH3(CH2)i2COOH<br>
Palmitic acid	CH3(CH2)i4COOH<br>
Stearic acid	CH3(CH2)16COOH<br>
Unsaturated<br>
Oleic acid	CH3.(CH2)7.CH=CH.(CH2)7COOH<br>
Linoleic acid	CH3.(CH2)4.CH=CH-CH2CH=CH.(CH2)7.COOH<br>
Linolenic acid	CH3.CH2.CH=CH.CH2.CH=CH.CH2.CH=CH.(CH2)7.COOH<br>
Eleostearic acid	CH3.(CH2)3.CH=CH.CH=CH.CH=CH.(CH2)7.COOH<br>
Ricinoleic acid	CH3.(CH2)5.CH.CH2.CH=CH.(CH2)7.COOH<br>
OH<br>
To autoxidise or air dry, an oil preferably contains at least 40%, preferably 50% of a fatty acid containing two double bonds; better air drying properties are obtained with oils containing a high proportion of fatty acids containing three double bonds, particularly if they are conjugated. Therefore oils, such as coconut oil, consisting principally of saturated acids are non-drying; Soya bean oil, which consists principally of unsaturated acids linoleic acid (2 double bonds) is semi-drying; linseed oil, which consists largely of unsaturated linolenic acid (3 double bonds) has good air drying properties.<br>
Oils such as linseed oil with a high content of unsaturated acids having 3 double bonds polymerise readily.<br>
Preferred acids are the C10-C24 unsaturated drying or semi drying -oil acids such as oleostearoyl, linoleoyl, linolenoyl, oleoyl, arachidonoyl as single entities or in naturally occurring combinations that result form the processing of linseed oil, tung oil, soybean oil, menhaden oil, tall oil, dehydrated castor oil and the like. In the preferred systems of present invention the amount of drying oil acid that is reacted to produce the copolymerisable compound should be at least 5% and we prefer to use an amount between 10% and 40%.<br>
Other milti-unsaturated monomers may be used as well as the unsaturated drying oil fatty acids. For example, allyl methacrylate or divinyl benzene may be used. However, they<br>
replace the fatty acid completely as, although such monomers produce gelled<br>
particles, they are not capable of autoxidation.<br>
A most preferred technique for introducing the autoxidisable moieties involves taking a copolymerisable compound, or monomer, containing a long chain unsaturated fatty acid moiety and copolymerising it with other monomers used in the production of the macromolecules. Preferably, the copolymerisable compound containing the fatty acid moiety should comprise from 5 to 50 wt % (and especially 10 to 40 wt %) of the monomers which are copolymerised to create the binder polymer.<br>
We prefer that the unsaturated fatty acid drying oil component containing the long chain unsaturated fatty acid moiety is copolymerised with an acrylic monomer to form the binder used in the present invention. Examples of acrylic monomers which may be used to produce the polymers used in this invention include acrylic or methacrylic acid esters such as methyl methacrylate, ethylacrylate, ethylmethacrylate, propylacrylate, propylmethacrylate, butylacrylate, butylmethacrylate, 2-ethylhexylacrylate, 2-ethylhexylmethacrylate, decylacrylate, decylmethacrylate, hydroxyethylacrylate, hydroxyethylmethacrylate, hydroxypropylacrylate and hydroxypropylmethacrylate. Examples of other copolymerisable monomers that may be used include alkenes such as ethylene and propylene; and polymerizable carboxylic acids such as acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, itaconic acid, maleic acid and fumaric acid. Examples of other suitable copolymerisable monomers include vinyl monomers such as acrylonitrite; dienes such as 1 ,2-butadiene, 1 ,3-butadiene and chloroprene; 1 ,3 ,5-hexatriene; styrenic monomers such as styrene, alpha -methyl styrene, vinyl toluene, vinyl carboxylate esters such as vinyl acetate; vinyl versatate; vinyl halides such as vinyl chloride and vinylidene chloride; etc. Preferred vinylic monomers include acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, acrylic acid and methacrylic acid esters of aliphatic or aromatic alcohols, styrene, substituted styrenes, vinyl acetate and other vinyl carboxylate esters. Other monomers that may be used include a-olefins such as ethylene, propylene or butene-1 and styrene or its homologues. Copolymerised styrene and its homologues have the additional advantage of being particularly active in generating and coupling to free radicals and so they promote the autoxidation process which in turn accelerates the onset of water-resistance.<br>
As a further embodiment of the present invention the autoxidisable copolymers of this invention are derived from and contain amide containing alpha, beta unsaturated monomers preferably up to 6% of these monomers. This has been found to further improve both the attainment of early hardness, for example at one day, and the film properties of the<br>
4p»ersions. Examples of such amide containing unsaturated monomers include aery lam ide, methacrylamide and alkoxy acrylamides and methacrylamides such as a butoxyl methacrylamide. We prefer to use at least 2% by weight based on the total weight of unsaturated monomers, particularly from 4 to 6 wt % of such an unsaturated amide.<br>
The copolymers of this invention are typically prepared by free radical emulsion polymerization preferably at low temperature with the monomers preferably pre-emulsified. A pre-emulsion of the monomers is preferably prepared in an aqueous solution containing surfactants and preferably a reducing agent, and a species that reversibly changes oxidation state. A chain transfer agent or regulator may be included in the pre-emulsion to control the gel content. Before introducing a free radical initiator into the system to initiate polymerization, the pre-emulsion is preferably homogenized, and oxygen is preferably displaced from the polymerization system with an inert gas.<br>
The amount and type of surfactants used in preparing the copolymers of this invention are not believed to be particularly critical. Nevertheless, minimum amounts are preferably used in order to reduce any adverse effects on dried film properties, such as water resistance. Suitable surfactants include anionic, non-ionic, and combinations thereof. Examples of anionic surfactants include salts of fatty rosin and naphthenic acids, condensation products of naphthalene sulfonic acid and formaldehyde of low molecular weight, carboxylic polymers and copolymers of the appropriate hydrophile-lipophile balance, alkali or ammonium alkyl sulfates, alkyl sulfonic acids, alkyl phophonic acids, fatty acids, oxyethylated alkyl phenol sulfates and phosphates. Examples of non-ionic emulsifiers include alkylphenol ethoxylates, polyoxyethylenated alkyl alcohols, amine polyglycol condensates, modified polyethoxy adducts, long chain carboxylic acid esters, modified terminated alkylaryl ether, and alkylpolyether alcohols. The amount of surfactant used is typically from about 0.1 to about 10% by weight based on the total weight of all monomers.<br>
A redox initiation system is used in which the initiators are coupled with a suitable reducing agent and a compound that reversibly changes oxidation state. Examples of reducing agents include reducing sugars, sodium formaldehyde sulfoxylate, and various amines. Suitable compounds that reversibly change oxidation state include various metal ions and their complexes, such as complexed ferric and ferrous ions with ethylenediaminetetraacetetate (EDTA) being common examples. Another example of a suitable ferric complex which can reversibly change oxidation states is ferrocene. The reducing agents are typically employed at a level of from about 0.5 to about 10% by weight based on the total weight of all monomers. The species that reversibly changes oxidation<br>
is typically present in an amount of from about 0.001 to about 1.5% by weight based on the total weight of all monomers. The use of higher amounts of initiator can result in lower conversion, we prefer to use from 0.15 to 0.5% fed with the charge to the reactor together with from 0.4 to 1%, preferably 0.5 to 0.7%, of the reducing agent.<br>
Chain transfer agents or chain regulators can be employed in an amount of from about 0.001 to about 5.0% by weight based on the total weight of all monomers. A chain regulator or chain transfer agent is an agent that restricts molecular weight when present in a small amount during polymerisation in order to control the gel content. Typically chain transfer agents include alkyl thiols such as n-dodecyl thiol and t-octyl thiol. Certain halogen compounds are also useful, such as carbon tetrabromide. Chain transfer agents do not stop polymerization, they terminate one chain while starting a new growing chain. The overall or net effect is more polymer chains for a given amount of monomer, and, hence, a lower average molecular weight.<br>
The preferred temperatures at which polymerization is performed depends on the monomers selected. However, the mini-emulsion polymerization is preferably carried out at temperatures below 80°C, typically from about 5"C to about 45°C typically to about 40°C, and more preferably from about 30°C to about 45°C and most preferably from about 30°C to about 35"C. We have found that if higher temperatures are used conversion can be reduced due to breakage of the chains in the unsaturated fatty acid drying oil component. Furthermore, the polymer particles can tend to flocculate at higher temperatures and low temperature polymerisation is therefore preferred to retain small particle size.<br>
A preferred process for the production of a dispersion of unsaturated copolymer of i) at least one unsaturated fatty acid drying oil component and ii) one or more monomers copolymerisable with i), the copolymer having a Tg of no more than 8°C and a microgel content of at least 15 wt % wherein the particles preferably have a mean particle size in the range 20 to 750 nanometres, comprises copolymerising an unsaturated fatty acid drying oil component and the copolymerisable monomer in an emulsion employing a redox initiation system wherein the polymerisation is performed at a temperature in the range 30-45°C.<br>
Mini-emulsion or micro-bulk polymerisation has been suggested as a way to reduce the amount of VOC's since it provides a finer emulsion of highly water-insoluble species such as monomers . Mini-emulsion polymerisation (see Schork et al, J. Appl. Polym. Sci., 60, 2069 (1996) and E. M. S. van Hamersveld et al., FATIPEC congr., 24, VOL D/247 (1998)) is thought to differ from conventional emulsion polymerization by proceeding in the monomer<br>
cjotolets of the emulsion. Diffusion of the vinylic monomers through the aqueous phase is not necessary. In mini-emulsion polymerisation, the monomers are pre-emulsified in water, in the presence of surfactants and a hydrophobic component, usually using high shear to form small uniform droplets. When an oil soluble initiator, in particular, is used, the small monomer droplets become the locus of polymerisation and form the polymer particles of the dispersion. It is thought that the hydrophobic component retains the more water-soluble monomers within the original particles which are the locus of the polymerisation. Schork et al. use a polymeric hydrophobe as an additive to a solution of the alkyd resin in vinylic monomers which are then dispersed in an aqueous solution of surfactants. Van Hamersveld et al. used essentially the same procedure, but with hexadecane as the hydrophobic additive.<br>
Hydroxypropylene mixed diesters of unsaturated fatty acids and (meth)acrylic acids which are the reaction products of unsaturated long chain fatty acids and glycidyl (meth)acrylate esters are the preferred monomers because they are relatively easily available. However they suffer from the disadvantage of having a very low solubility in water which inhibits their activity in conventional aqueous copolymerisation processes unless environmentally unwelcome amounts of organic co-solvent are also present. It has been discovered that this can be solved by stirring the co-monomers (including the copolymerisable compound such as the diester) together with water, polymerisation initiator and surfactant and then subjecting the stirred mixture to intensive agitation sufficient to create a very large number of very small (less than SOOnm in diameter) droplets of mixture of co-monomers. The polymerisation initiator may be water soluble or oil soluble; that is to say soluble in the monomers. When an oil soluble initiator, such as lauryl peroxide is used, it is preferred that it is first dissolved in the monomers and subjected to the intensive agitation prior to causing the polymerisation to proceed. When a water soluble polymerisation initiator is used, such as for example ammonium persulphate, it may be added either before or after intensive agitation. When such a water soluble initiator is used, copolymerisation is initiated in the water phase but then the copolymerising system will migrate into organic zones created by the droplets where copolymerisation will continue. The migration will be quick because it is favoured by the high surface area provided by the very large number of very small droplets of co-monomer. This migration permits effective copolymerisation of very low water-solubility monomers, in this case the autoxideable copolymerisable compounds.<br>
The preferred mixed diester comprises methacrylate moieties and moieties derived from drying and semi-drying oil fatty acids and the most preferred from tall oil fatty acid.<br>
^ymerisation can be effected by raising the temperature. Preferably temperatures of 30 to 80°C more preferably 30-45°C are used. Additionally and alternatively, a redox initiator system may be used. Suitable examples of such systems include hydrogen peroxide and ascorbic acid, ammonium persulphate and sodium metabisulphite or sodium sulphoxylate formaldehyde. Optionally metal salts such as copper or iron salts may be added.<br>
The required intensive agitation may be provided by mechanical emulsifiers such as a Ross 100 (available from Ross and Son, Hauppauge, New York, USA) or a Silverson (available from Silverson machines Ltd, Chesham, Buckinghamshire, UK) or an IKA emulsifier (available from IKA-Works Inc, Cincinnati, Ohio, USA). Alternatively, a Sonolator (available from Sonic Corp, Stratford, Connecticut, USA) may be used which employs ultrasound to generate the required shear. Preferably, agitation is sufficiently energetic to produce eventual particles of miniemulsion which have a number average particle size of below 500nm and preferably below SOOnm.<br>
The coating systems of the present invention can be employed in various aqueous paints, coatings, inks, adhesives and sealants, and in particular in water-based systems that are free of organic solvents or coalescents. The coatings may be clear coatings or in the case of paints they will contain pigments, optionally extender pigments, dispersing agents for the pigments and perhaps viscosity modifiers and flow aids. A drying catalyst is preferably added to the aqueous dispersion to accelerate the autoxidative cross-linking and hardening of the coating. The drying catalysts (also known as dryers or siccatives) are generally organometallic compounds, typically transition metal soaps such as cobalt napthenate. Other examples include manganese, lead and zirconium soaps. The cobalt, manganese, lead and zirconium soaps are sometimes used in combination with other metal soaps, such as calcium or potassium soaps, which in themselves are not dryers.<br>
We have found that the high gel containing autoxidative dispersions of the present invention show very much improved early cure than conventional water dispersible alkyds. Furthermore, we have found that this may be achieved when catalysed with very low levels of Vanadium driers. We have found that when using the systems of the present invention harder coatings may be obtained using surprisingly low amounts, below 1% typically 0.2% to 0.6wt% based on the weight of non volatile materials in the coating of Vanadium driers. This is opposite to the behaviour observed with waterborne alkyds where the use of Cobalt is necessitated to obtain acceptable cure with time. Thus compositions based on our novel dispersions can be cured with low levels or even without use of Cobalt driers which is a<br>
r embodiment of the present invention. The coatings obtained from the systems of the present invention are harder than coatings obtained from previous aqueous coating systems.<br>
Fillers, extenders, pigments and other additives known in the art may also be used in the compositions of this invention, if desired.<br>
We have found that in order to produce autoxidisable materials that can be applied as aqueous systems and which will dry and harden rapidly to produce desirable coatings the polymeric binder should be precrosslinked in the form of a microgel, should have a calculated Fox glass transition temperature Tg below 8°C preferably below 5°C and should contain residual unsaturation. For the purpose of these Tg calculations, the Tg of hydroxypropylene mixed diesters of tall oil fatty acid and glycidyl methacrylate has been assumed to be that of stearyl methacrylate which is (-50°C) since it is not possible to homopolymerise without crosslinking to determine its experimentally derived Tg. The resins used in the coating compositions of the present invention therefore contain a high proportion of drying oil acid or its derivatives and are themselves highly unsaturated. The resins are however already crosslinked to a degree to produce the microgel. We have found that this combination ensures that coatings derived from these resins are quick drying to form hard coatings through autoxidation. We have also found that these resins can be used in aqueous coating compositions which may be totally free of organic solvents or dispersants or may be used in coating compositions employing a significantly reduced amount of organic solvents or dispersants. Accordingly the present invention allows the production of coatings which are as hard as, or often harder than coatings obtained from conventional alkyd resins or film forming non crosslinking acrylic resins and which dry and are handleable in less than 4 hours, sometimes less than 3 hours and which can be applied from aqueous systems.<br>
We have found that the dispersions of the present invention, are compatible with a wide range of other aqueous polymer dispersions which include alkyd dispersions, acrylic dispersions and poly-urethane acrylic hybrid dispersions. We have found that this use of the compositions of the present invention enhances the film forming properties in particular they improve the speed of hardening of the coatings and we prefer to use from 20% to 80% by weight of the total composition of the compositions of the present invention.<br>
The present invention is illustrated by reference to the following Examples in which the polymeric binders were prepared as follows.<br>
ss for the production of GMA/TOFA adduct. an unsaturated fatty acid drying oil component.<br>
SOO.Og of tall oil fatty acid (TOFA), 11.1 g of tetraethyl ammonium bromide and 0.86g of hydroquinone were charged under nitrogen to a one litre round bottom flask fitted with a reflux condenser and a stirrer. The contents of the flask were stirred and heated to 80°C and then 355.Og of glycidyl methacrylate were added gradually over a period of 2 hours whilst at a temperature of 80°C and stirring were maintained for a further 1.5 hours.<br>
During the process, TOFA reacted with oxirane moieties in the glycidyl methacrylate to form a copolymerisable diester in which unsaturated methacrylate moieties were linked to an autoxidisable TOFA carboxylate by a hydroxypropylene divalent group. The reaction was catalysed by the tetraethyl ammonium bromide and premature polymerisation was inhibited by the hydroquinone. The resulting copolymerisable compound was a copolymerisable autoxidisable monomer and was stored at 4°C until used. A molar excess of the glycidyl methacrylate over the TOFA was used.<br>
The dispersions were prepared according to the formulation recipe (Table 1) and miniemulsion method described below. Adducts with lower or equivalent molar excess can also be used and give similar performance in coatings.<br>

•	Example 16 demonstrates that low gel content lowers the early hardness of the coatings.<br>
Examples 11, 14, and 15 demonstrate that higher values of hardness are achieved when<br>
methacrylamide is employed as a co-monomer.<br>
Example 17 shows that early hardness is not developed with commercial alkyd dispersions when used with vanadium driers while examples 9,10,12 and 13 demonstrate excellent hardness observed in our coatings using low levels of vanadium driers.<br>
Examples 18 - 20<br>
Paints were prepared from the binders produced according to Example 1-8 employing the following paint formulation. The millbase was first prepared by dispersing in a high speed paint disperser and then the other ingredients listed in the paint make up were added to finish making of the paint.<br><br>

The paints had a PVC of 20%, a solids content of 51.5% by weight and a volume nv% of 38.65%; volume nv% is the total volume of the non volatile part of the coating expressed as a percentage of the total volume of the coating.<br>
The paints were applied using a 200 micron block spreader and allowed to become touch dry and the second coat was applied.<br>
Finger tackiness and marking resistance was tested at regular intervals on both single coats and double coats.<br>
For marking resistance measurement, a hard 1cm x 1cm square plastic textured matt was stuck to a 10kg iron weight. This weight was applied on the surface of the drying paint film with the textured matt surface face down for a period of 5 seconds. The mark was observed after the paint film had dried fully.<br>
In the case of the paints of the invention, the marks disappeared within several minutes after the removal of the weight. However, the marks remained in the paint layers produced from the comparative waterborne alkyd emulsion.<br>
The results are set out in Table 3<br>
(Table Remove)<br>
The above miniemulsions were made exactly as described for miniemulsions 1-8 in Table 1 except that the temperature of polymerisation was kept at 60°C.<br>
The above latices were then made into clearcoats with addition of Cobalt drier as in examples 9-16 and applied on glass plates. The hardness coatings measured after 1 day, 7 days and 30 days. The results are given in Table 5.<br>
(Table Remove)<br>
The data show that as the styrene content is increased, the hardness development or cure rate is increased as well as the final hardness.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
