PURIFICATION OF POLYPEPTIDES<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
1. Field of the Invention<br>
This invention relates to a process for purifying polypeptides of interest from microbial<br>
fermentation broth or homogenate. More particularly, a precipitation agent is introduced to the broth or<br>
homogenate to effect, for example, protein, DNA, and cell debris removal.<br>
2. Description of Related Art<br>
The advent of recombinant technology now allows for the production of high levels of proteins<br>
within suitably transformed host cells. As a result, there is increased demand for fast, robust, and efficient<br>
purification methods to recover the recombinantly produced proteins. Generally, proteins are produced by<br>
culturing cells, such as mammalian, insect, fungal, and bacterial cell lines, engineered to produce the protein<br>
of interest by insertion of a recombinant plasmid containing the gene for that protein. Since the cell lines<br>
used are living organisms, they must be fed with a complex growth medium, containing sugars, amino acids,<br>
and growth factors, usually supplied from preparations of animal serum. Separation of the desired protein<br>
from the mixture of compounds fed to the cells and from the by-products of the cells themselves to a purity<br>
sufficient for use as a human therapeutic poses a formidable challenge.<br>
Procedures for purification of proteins from cell debris initially depend on the site of expression of<br>
the protein. Some proteins can be secreted directly from the cell into the surrounding growth media; others<br>
are made intracellularly. For polypeptides produced in mammalian cells, the purification scheme is<br>
significantly easier than for polypeptides produced in other types of host cells. Mammalian cells export the<br>
polypeptides so that they can be collected from the growth media, where they are present in relatively pure<br>
form. However, if the polypeptide is produced in a non-mammalian cell, e.g., a microorganism such as<br>
fungi or E. coli, the polypeptide will be recovered inside the cell or in the periplasmic space (Kipriyanov and<br>
Little. Molecular Biotechnology, 12: 173-201 (1999); Skerra and Pluckthun, Science, 240: 1038-1040<br>
(1988)). Hence, it is necessary to release the protein from the cells to the extracellular medium by extraction<br>
such as cell lysis. Such disruption releases the entire contents of the cell into the homogenate, and in<br>
addition produces subcellular fragments that are difficult to remove due to their small size. These are<br>
generally removed by differential centrifugation or by filtration.<br>
Cell lysis is typically accomplished using mechanical disruption techniques such as homogenization<br>
or head milling. While the protein of interest is generally effectively liberated, such techniques have several<br>
disadvantages (Engler, Protein Purification Process Engineering, Harrison eds., 37-55 (1994)). Temperature<br>
increases, which often occur during processing, may result in inactivation of the protein. Moreover, the<br>
resulting suspension contains a broad spectrum of contaminating proteins, nucleic acids, and<br>
polysaccharides. Nucleic acids and polysaccharides increase solution viscosity, potentially complicating<br>
subsequent processing by centrifugation, cross-flow filtration, or chromatography. Complex associations of<br>
these contaminants with the protein of interest can complicate the purification process and result in<br>
unacceptably low yields.<br><br>
Attorney Docket No: P1941R1<br>
As such, more selective means of releasing intracellular proteins facilitates further downstream<br>
processing. Several techniques have been reported to permeabilize cells and/or to extract intracellular<br>
proteins. These methods include the use of solvents, detergents, chaotropic agents, antibiotics, enzymes, and<br>
chelating agents to enhance cell permeability and/or promote extraction. Additions of certain compounds,<br>
such as glycine, to the fermentation medium during culture growth have also been reported to promote<br>
release of certain intracellular enzymes. Finally, techniques such as freeze-thaw treatment or osmotic shock<br>
have also been shown to release subsets of intracellular proteins.<br>
However, these techniques are not necessarily applicable to all intracellular microbial proteins, and<br>
all have limited application for large-scale processing, and/or other disadvantages.   For example, while<br>
solvents such as toluene and chloroform promote release of intracellular proteins, these substances are<br>
known to be toxic and/or carcinogenic (Windholtz et al., The Merck Index 10th Edition: 300 and 1364<br>
(1983)). Ionic detergents, such as SDS, often irreversibly denature isolated proteins. Although non-ionic<br>
detergents are not normally denaturing, the recovered proteins are often associated with detergent micelles<br>
that can require additional processing to yield detergent-free protein. Chaotropic agents, such as urea and<br>
guanidine hydrochloride, can be denaturing at the concentrations required for complete release, and their<br>
effectiveness may be dependent on the growth phase of the culture. The use of lysozyme, which provides<br>
for a relatively gentle means of protein release, is limited because of its relatively high cost and because of<br>
the subsequent need to purify the protein of interest from the enzyme reagent. In addition, chelating agents,<br>
often used to enhance the effectiveness of other permeabilizing/release techniques such as lysozyme or<br>
toluene extraction, suffer from the disadvantage of non-specific release of host proteins.<br>
Other methods for protein release also have disadvantages. For example, osmotic shock, in which<br>
cells are suspended in a high osmolarity medium, recovered, and subsequently placed in a low osmolarity<br>
buffer, requires additional processing steps with respect to other extraction alternatives (Moir et al,<br>
Separation Processes in Biotechnology. Asenjo eds: 67-94 (1990)) or necessitates the handling of large<br>
liquid volumes at low temperatures. This renders the method unattractive for large-scale processing.<br>
Freeze-thaw treatment also releases intracellular proteins, although relatively low yields often result<br>
in multiple cycles or additional processing requirements. In addition, cell paste freezing is an added non-<br>
trivial processing requirement compared with other extraction alternatives.<br>
Finally, reagents, such as glycine, have been added during fermentation to promote protein release<br>
to the extracellular medium (Aristidou et al.. Biotechnology Letters 15: 331-336(1993)). While partial<br>
release of several intracellular proteins has been reported, this approach requires direct coupling of<br>
fermentation and release strategies and subsequent separation of the protein of interest from a potentially<br>
complex extracellular broth.<br>
Once the polypeptide of interest is released from the host cell, purification thereof from other cell<br>
components is required. Unfortunately, most extraction approaches, such as cell lysis, not only expose the<br>
protein to potential degradation by host cell proteases, but also make isolation of the protein from other<br>
elements of the resulting suspension more difficult. For example, the presence of negatively charged<br>
molecules, such as DNA, RNA, phospholipids, and lipopolysaccharides (LPS), often requires the use of<br>
anion-exchange chromatography (Sassenfeld, TIBTECH. 8: 88-93 (1990); Spears, Biotechnology, vol. 3-<br>
Bioprocessing, Rehm eds:40-51 (1993)) and/or precipitation with polycations, such as protamine sulfate<br>

cell pellets are re-suspended at room temperature in 20 mM MES buffer, pH 6.0 containing 5 mM EDTA<br>
and 20 mM 4,4'-DTP previously dissolved in ethanol (3 liters of buffer/kg of cell pellet). The suspended<br>
cells are disrupted by two passages through a Mantin Gaulin homogenizer at 5500 to 6500 PSI. The<br>
homogenate is adjusted to 0.25% (v/v) with polyethyleneimine (PEI) and diluted with an equal volume of 2-<br>
8°C. purified water. The diluted homogenate is then centrifuged. The antibody fragment is found in the<br>
supernatant.<br>

Historically, immunoglobulin G (IgG) has been purified from human serum and plasma (Putnam,<br>
cd.. The Plasma Proteins. vol. 1 (Academic Press, 1975)). The purification process has often contained one<br>
or more precipitation steps.  The most commonly used precipitation scheme for recovering IgG is the Colin<br>
iractionation (Cohn et al., J. Amer. Chem. Soc. 72: 465 (1950)). However, other precipitation techniques<br>
have been reported (Niederauer and Glatz, Advances in Biochemical Engineering Biotechnology, v. 47<br>
(Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg, 1992): Steinberg and Hershberger, Biochim. et Biophys. Acta. 342:<br>
195-206 (1974)). The pioneering work of purifying IgG from plasma using 6,9-diamino-2-ethoxyacridine<br>
lactate (USAN name and herein called ethacridine lactate and also known by the names ETHODINIM or<br>
RIVANOL™), a highly aromatic cationic dye, is reported by Horsjsi and Smetana, Acta Med. Scand., 155:<br>
65 (1956). The following decade produced a number of publications showing the capability of 6,9-diamino-<br>
2-ethoxyacridine lactate to purify IgG and other proteins (Miller, Nature. 184: 450 (1959); Steinbuch and<br>
Niewiarowski, Nature. 186: 87 (1960); Neurath and Brunner, Experientia. 25: 668 (1969)) from biological<br>
materials, e.g., plasma and growth media. Use of ethacridine lactate to recover antibodies and other proteins<br>
from other sources has been reported. See Tchernov et al., J. Biotechnol.. 69: 69-73 (1999); SU 944580<br>
published 28 July 1982; Franek and Dolnikova, Biotech-Forum-Eur. 7: 468-470 (1990); EP 250288<br>
published 23 Dec. 1987; DE3604947 published 20 August 1987; Rothwell et al., Anal. Biochem.. 149: 197-<br>
201 (1985); Lutsik and Antonyuk, Biokhimiva. 47: 1710-1715 (1982); and Aizenman et al., Mikrobiol-Zh.,<br>
44:69-72(1982).<br>
The primary step of recovering polypeptides from microorganisms is most often concerned with<br>
removing solid material, e.g., cells and cellular debris. It is important to recognize the need to separate the<br>
desired product from components present in conditioned medium with which it specifically interacts. Where<br>
the protein of interest is positively charged, it will tend to bind to any negatively charged molecules present,<br>
thereby making purification of the protein by traditional methods very difficult. Additional removal of<br>
contaminating soluble protein from crude microbial extracts, e.g., E. coli homogenate. during this step would<br>
simplify subsequent chromatography steps. Such additional removal would be especially valuable for<br>
industrial-scale production, resulting in decreased chromatography column size and production times.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
The invention involving purification is as claimed.<br>
Specifically, in one aspect, the invention provides a method for purifying a desired heterologous<br>
polypeptide from microbial fermentation broth or homogenate in which it is produced and solubilized<br>
comprising adding to the broth or homogenate an effective amount of a solution of 6,9-diamino-2-<br>
ethoxyacridine lactate (ethacridine lactate) to precipitate host cell impurities under conditions wherein the<br>
majority of the polypeptide remains soluble, and separating the desired polypeptide from the broth or<br>
homogenate.<br>
In another aspect, the invention provides a microbial cells fermentation broth or homogenate<br>
comprising ethacridine lactate and a polypeptide heterologous to the cells.<br>
Addition of ethacridine lactate as a precipitation agent unexpectedly results in a dramatic removal<br>
of host debris including host proteins. In this process, the majority of host proteins will be recovered in a<br>
precipitate together with the cell debris, and the polypeptide is recovered in the clarified supernatant. The<br>

Attorney Docket No: P1941R1<br>
improved purity of the clarified extract when using ethacridine lactate results in reduction in the volume of<br>
chromatographic media or resin required for the columns, thereby reducing the scale needed for subsequent<br>
purification. It also results in elimination of some chromatographic step(s), which improves processing time<br>
and cost. In addition, the process herein results in a stable feedstock and can be operated at a neutral pH.<br>

soluble ethacridine lactate was determined. The open keys symbolize the 1.2% ethacridine lactate solution<br>
and the closed keys the 0.6% solution. The solid line is the 0.6% ethacridine lactate solution at pH 6.0, the<br>
broken line is the 1.2% ethacridine lactate solution at pH 6, the dotted line is the 0.6% ethacridine lactate<br>
solution at pH 9, and the broken line with dots is the 1.2% ethacridine lactate solution at pH 9.<br>

homogenate, i.e.. anti-CDI8 (F(ab')2), anti-TF (F(ab')2), and full-length anti-TF (Figs. 12A, 12B, and 12C.<br>
respectively). The homogenate was diluted 4-fold to a final ethacridine lactate concentration of 0.6% and<br>
the pH was adjusted to 8.5, 7.5, and 6.0 for anti-CD18 (F(ab')2), anti-TF (F(ab')2), and full-length anti-TF.<br>
respectively. The temperature and time for incubation are indicated in the figures. The arrows indicate<br>
product band.<br>
Figure 13 shows a graph of turbidity as a function of time for three different supernatants.<br>
Supernatants from anti-CD 18 homogenate treated with 0.6% ethacridine lactate are symbolized by solid<br>
circles (4°C) or open circles (21°C), and 0.2% PEI-treated sample is shown as solid squares (4°C) and open<br>
squares (21°C). A supernatant recovered from a clarified anti-CD18 homogenate that had been diluted with<br>
water before concentration is shown as solid triangles (4°C) and open triangles (21 °C). In all cases the anti-<br>
CD 18 homogenate had been diluted 4-fold and the pH was 7.2.<br>

Definitions<br>
The expression "microbial fermentation broth or homogenate" refers to broth, paste, or extract,<br>
preferably resuspended. obtained from microorganisms, including yeast, fungi, and prokaryotes such as<br>
bacteria, that are cultured and consuming nutrients, no matter what culturing vessel is utilized, for example,<br>
a shake flask or fermentor. Preferably, the broth or homogenate is from yeast or prokaryotes. More<br>
preferably, the broth or homogenate is from bacteria. Homogenate is preferred herein. In some cases if the<br>
solution has very high conductivity it may be preferred to harvest the cells and re-suspend them, but<br>
otherwise, it is preferred to use the homogenate as it is directly from the fermentor.   The components of the<br>
broth or homogenate include cell debris, host cell protein, DNA, RNA, etc. Thus, the addition of the lactate<br>
herein leads to selective precipitation of host cell proteins, etc., giving better purification power than not<br>
using the lactate.<br>

The expression "under conditions wherein the majority of the polypeptide remains soluble" refers to<br>
addition of ethacridine lactate to the broth or homogenate in amounts and at a temperature and conductivity<br>
level that prevent the majority of the target polypeptide from precipitating from the broth or homogenate.<br>
Preferably, such conditions prevent more than about 60% of the polypeptide from precipitating, more<br>
preferably more than about 70%. still more preferably more than about 75%, even more preferably more<br>
than about 80%, even still more preferably more than about 85%, and still more preferably more than about<br>
85%, even still more preferably more than about 90%, and most preferably more than about 95%. This<br>
degree of solubility is measured by an appropriate assay, such as, for example, RP-HPLC, affinity<br>
chromatography, ELI SAs, RIAs, and a combination of SDS-PAGE and high-performance affinity<br>
chromatography (HPAC). The choice of assay depends on such factors as the type of host cell used and<br>
polypeptide being produced.<br>
The "bacteria" for purposes herein include eubacteria and archaebacteria. Preferred of these are<br>
eubacteria, including gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. More preferred are gram-negative bacteria.<br>
One preferred type of bacteria is Enterobacteriaceae. Examples of bacteria belonging to Enterobacteriaceae<br>
include Escherichia, Enterobacter, Erwinia, Klebsiella, Proteus, Salmonella, Serratia, and Shigella. Other<br>
types of suitable bacteria include Azotobacler, Pseudomonas, Rhizobia, Vitreoscilta, and Paracoccus. E.<br>
co/i is preferred herein. Suitable E. coli hosts include E. coli W3110 (ATCC 27,325), E. coli 294 (ATCC<br>
31,446), E. coli B, and E. coli X1776 (ATCC 31,537). These examples are illustrative rather than limiting,<br>
and W3110 is preferred. Mutant cells of any of the above-mentioned bacteria may also be employed. It is,<br>
of course, necessary to select the appropriate bacteria taking into consideration replicability of the replicon<br>
in the cells of a bacterium. For example, E. coli, Serratia, or Salmonella species can be suitably used as the<br>
host when well-known plasmids such as pBR322, pBR325, pACYC177, or pKN4lO are used to supply the<br>
replicon. See further below regarding examples of suitable bacterial host cells.<br>
As used herein, the expressions "cell," "cell line," "strain," and "cell culture" are used<br>
interchangeably and all such designations include progeny. Thus, the words "transformants" and<br>
"transformed cells" include the primary subject cell and cultures derived therefrom without regard for the<br>
number of transfers. It is also understood that all progeny may not be precisely identical in DNA content,<br>
due to deliberate or inadvertent mutations. Mutant progeny that have the same function or biological activity<br>
as screened for in the originally transformed cell are included. Where distinct designations are intended, it<br>
will be clear from the context.<br>
As used herein, "'polypeptide" refers generally to peptides and proteins from any cell source having<br>
more than about ten amino acids. "Heterologous" polypeptides are those polypeptides foreign to the host<br>
cell being utilized, such as a human protein produced by E. coli. While the heterologous polypeptide may be<br>
prokaryotic or eukaryotic. preferably it is eukaryotic, more preferably mammalian, and most preferably<br>
human. Preferably, it is a recombinantly produced, or recombinant polypeptide.<br>
The polypeptide is produced and solubilized in the fermentation broth or homogenate, meaning that<br>
it is made in such broth or homogenate and is either already in a soluble fraction resulting from production,<br>
or is in an insoluble fraction or form or phase that is treated or contacted with a solubilizing agent such as a<br>
chaotrope (e.g., urea or guanidine) or detergent (such as sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)), with or without a<br>
reducing agent (such as dithiothreitol or beta-mcrcaptoethanol) so as to be solubilized. "'Soluble,"<br>
8<br><br>
Attorney Docket No: P1941R1<br>
"solubilized." "solubilization," "dissolved." or "dissolution" in the sense used herein means that the<br>
polypeptide is in the supernatant rather than in the solids fraction after centrifugation. Precipitation or<br>
degree of solubility can be determined, for example, by the appropriate assays as noted above.<br>

The term "antibody" herein is used in the broadest sense and specifically covers intact monoclonal<br>
antibodies, polyclonal antibodies, muitispecific antibodies (e.g. bispecific antibodies) formed from at least<br>
two intact antibodies, and antibody fragments, so long as they exhibit the desired biological activity.<br>
The term "monoclonal antibody" as used herein refers to an antibody obtained from a population of<br>
substantially homogeneous antibodies, i.e., the individual antibodies comprising the population are identical<br>
except for possible naturally occurring mutations that may be present in minor amounts. Monoclonal<br>
antibodies are highly specific, being directed against a single antigenic site. Furthermore, in contrast to<br>
polyclonal antibody preparations that include different antibodies directed against different determinants<br>
(epitopes), each monoclonal antibody is directed against a single determinant on the antigen. In addition to<br>
their specificity, the monoclonal antibodies are advantageous in that they may be synthesized<br>
uncontaminated by other antibodies. The modifier "monoclonal" indicates the character of the antibody as<br>
being obtained from a substantially homogeneous population of antibodies, and is not to be construed as<br>
requiring production of the antibody by any particular method. For example, the monoclonal antibodies to<br>
be used in accordance with the present invention may be made by the hybridoma method first described by<br>
Koehler et al., Nature, 256: 495 (1975), or may be made by recombinant DNA methods (see, e.g., U.S.<br>
Patent No. 4,816.567). The "monoclonal antibodies" may also be isolated from phage antibody libraries<br>
using the techniques described in Clackson el al, Nature, 352: 624-628 (1991) and Marks et al., J. Mol.<br>
BioL 222: 581-597 (1991), for example.<br>
The monoclonal antibodies herein specifically include "chimeric" antibodies in which a portion of<br>
the heavy and/or light chain is identical with or homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies<br>
derived from a particular species or belonging to a particular antibody class or subclass, while the remainder<br>
of the chain(s) is identical with or homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from<br>
another species or belonging to another antibody class or subclass, as well as fragments of such antibodies,<br>
so long as they exhibit the desired biological activity (U.S. Patent No. 4,816,567; and Morrison et al, Proc.<br>
Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 81_: 6851-6855 (1984)). Chimeric antibodies of interest herein include "primatized"<br>
antibodies comprising variable-domain antigen-binding sequences derived from a non-human primate (e.g.<br>
Old World Monkey, Ape etc) and human constant-region sequences.<br>
"Antibody fragments" comprise a portion of an intact antibody, preferably comprising the antigen-<br>
binding or variable region thereof. Examples of antibody fragments include Fab, Fab', F(ab')2, and Fv<br>
fragments; diabodics; linear antibodies; single-chain antibody molecules; and muitispecific antibodies<br>
formed from antibody fragment(s).<br>

Attorney Docket No: P1941R1<br>
An "intact" antibody is one that comprises an antigen-binding variable region as well as a light<br>
chain constant domain (CL) and heavy chain constant domains, CH1, CH2 and CH3. The constant domains<br>
may be native sequence constant domains (e.g. human native-sequence constant domains) or amino acid<br>
sequence variant thereof. Preferably, the intact antibody has one or more effector functions.<br>
Antibody "effector functions" refer to those biological activities attributable to the Fc region (a<br>
native-sequence Fc region or Fc region with amino acid sequence variation) of an antibody. Examples of<br>
antibody effector functions include Clq binding, complement dependent cytotoxicity, Fc receptor binding,<br>
antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC), phagocytosis, down- regulation of cell-surface<br>
receptors (e.g. B cell receptor; BCR), etc.<br>
Depending on the amino acid sequence of the constant domain of their heavy chains, intact<br>
antibodies can be assigned to different "classes".   There are five classes of immunoglobulins: IgA, IgD, IgE,<br>
IgG, and IgM, having heavy chains designated V, *, „ (, and µ, respectively. The ( and V classes are further<br>
divided into subclasses on the basis of relatively minor differences in CH sequence and function, e.g.,<br>
humans express the following subclasses: IgGl, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4, IgAl, and IgA2. The subunit structures<br>
and three-dimensional configurations of different classes of immunoglobulins are well known.<br>
"Antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity" and "ADCC" refer to a cell-mediated reaction in<br>
which nonspecific cytotoxic cells that express Fc receptors (FcRs) (e.g. Natural Killer (NK) cells,<br>
neutrophils, and macrophages) recognize bound antibody on a target cell and subsequently cause lysis of the<br>
target cell. The primary cells for mediating ADCC, NK cells, express FcRIII only, whereas monocytes<br>
express FcRI, FcRII and FcRIII. FcR expression on hematopoietic cells in summarized is Table 3 on page<br>
464 of Ravetch and Kinet, Annu. Rev. Immunol.. 9: 457-492 (1991). To assess ADCC activity of a<br>
molecule of interest, an in vitro ADCC assay, such as that described in US Patent No. 5,500,362 or<br>
5,821,337 may be performed. Useful effector cells for such assays include peripheral blood mononuclear<br>
cells (PBMC) and Natural Killer (NK) cells. Alternatively, or additionally, ADCC activity of the molecule<br>
of interest may be assessed in vivo, e.g., in a animal model such as that disclosed in Clynes et al. Proc.Natl.<br>
Acad. Sci. USA, 95: 652-656 (1998).<br>
"Human effector cells" are leukocytes that express one or more FcRs and perform effector<br>
functions. Preferably, the cells express at least FcRIII and perform ADCC effector function. Examples of<br>
human leukocytes that mediate ADCC include peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), natural killer<br>
(NK) cells, monocytes, cytotoxic T cells, and neutrophils, with PBMCs and NK cells being preferred. The<br>
effector cells may be isolated from a native source thereof, e.g. from blood or PBMCs as described herein.<br>
"Native antibodies" are usually heterotetrameric glycoproteins of about 150,000 daltons, composed<br>
of two identical light (L) chains and two identical heavy (H) chains. Each light chain is linked to a heavy<br>
chain by one covalent disulfide bond, while the number of disulfide linkages varies among the heavy chains<br>
of different immunoglobulin isotypes. Each heavy and light chain also has regularly spaced intrachain<br>
disulfide bridges. Each heavy chain has at one end a variable domain (VH) followed by a number of constant<br>
domains. Each light chain has a variable domain at one end (VL) and a constant domain at its other end.<br>
The constant domain of the light chain is aligned with the first constant domain of the heavy chain, and the<br>
light-chain variable domain is aligned with the variable domain of the heavy chain. Particular amino acid<br>
residues are believed to form an interface between the light-chain and heavy-chain variable domains.<br>
12<br><br>
Attorney Docket No: P1941R1<br>
The term "variable" refers to the faet that certain portions of the variable domains differ extensively<br>
in sequence among antibodies and are used in the binding and specificity of each particular antibody for its<br>
particular antigen. However, the variability is not evenly distributed throughout the variable domains of<br>
antibodies. It is concentrated in three segments called hypervariable regions both in the light-chain and the<br>
heavy-chain variable domains. The more highly conserved portions of variable domains are called the<br>
framework regions (FRs). The variable domains of native heavy and light chains each comprise four FRs,<br>
largely adopting a beta-sheet configuration, connected by three hypervariable regions, which form loops<br>
connecting, and in some cases forming, part of the beta-sheet structure. The hypervariable regions in each<br>
chain are held together in close proximity by the FRs and, with the hypervariable regions from the other<br>
chain, contribute to the formation of the antigen-binding site of antibodies (see Kabat el al.. Sequences of<br>
Proteins of Immunological Interest. 5th Ed. Public Health Service, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda,<br>
MD. (1991)). The constant domains are not involved directly in binding an antibody to an antigen, but<br>
exhibit various effector functions, such as participation of the antibody in antibody-dependent cellular<br>
cytotoxicity (ADCC).<br>
The term "hypervariable region" when used herein refers to the amino acid residues of an antibody<br>
that are responsible for antigen binding. The hypervariable region generally comprises amino acid residues<br>
from a "complementarity-determining region'"or "CDR" (e.g. residues 24-34 (LI), 50-56 (L2) and 89-97<br>
(L3) in the light-chain variable domain and 31-35 (HI), 50-65 (H2) and 95-102 (H3) in the heavy-chain<br>
variable domain; Kabat et al., Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest. 5th Ed. Public Health<br>
Service, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD. (1991)) and/or those residues from a "hypervariable<br>
loop" (e.g. residues 26-32 (LI), 50-52 (L2) and 91-96 (L3) in the light-chain variable domain and 26-32<br>
(HI), 53-55 (H2) and 96-101 (H3) in the heavy-chain variable domain; Chothia and Lesk, J. Mol. Biol.. 196:<br>
901-917 (1987)). "Framework Region" or "FR" residues are those variable domain residues other than the<br>
hypervariable region residues as herein defined.<br>
Papain digestion of antibodies produces two identical antigen-binding fragments, called "Fab"<br>
fragments, each with a single antigen-binding site, and a residual "Fc" fragment, whose name reflects its<br>
ability to crystallize readily. Pepsin treatment yields an F(ab')2 fragment that has two antigen-binding sites<br>
and is still capable of cross-linking antigen.<br>
"Fv" is the minimum antibody fragment that contains a complete antigen-recognition and antigen-<br>
binding site. This region consists of a dimer ol one heavy-chain and one light-chain variable domain in~<br>
tight, non-covalent association. It is in this configuration that the three hypervariable regions of each<br>
variable domain interact to define an antigen-binding site on the surface of the VH-VL dimer. Collectively,<br>
the six hypervariable regions confer antigen-binding specificity to the antibody. However, even a single<br>
variable domain (or half of an Fv comprising only three hypervariable regions specific for an antigen) has<br>
the ability to recognize and bind antigen, although at a lower affinity than the entire binding site.<br>
The Fab fragment also contains the constant domain of the light chain and the first constant domain<br>
(CH1) of the heavy chain. Fab' fragments differ from Fab fragments by the addition of a few residues at the<br>
carboxyl terminus of the heavy-chain CH 1 domain including one or more cysteines from the antibody hinge<br>
region. Fab'-SH is the designation herein for Fab' in which the cysteine residue(s) of the constant domains<br>
bear at least one free thiol group. F(ab')2 antibody fragments originally were produced as pairs of Fab'<br>
13<br><br>
Attorney Docket No: P1941R1<br>
fragments that have hinge cysteines between them. Other chemical couplings of antibody fragments are also<br>
known.<br>
The "light chains" of antibodies from any vertebrate species can be assigned to one of two clearly<br>
distinct types, called kappa (6) and lambda (8), based on the amino acid sequences of their constant domains.<br>
"Single-chain Fv" or "scFv" antibody fragments comprise the VH and VL domains of antibody,<br>
wherein these domains are present in a single polypeptide chain. Preferably, the Fv polypeptide further-<br>
comprises a polypeptide linker between the VH and VL domains that enables the scFv to form the desired<br>
structure for antigen binding. For a review of scFv, see Pliickthun in The Pharmacology of Monoclonal<br>
Antibodies, vol. 113, Rosenburg and Moore eds. (Springer-Verlag, New York, 1994), pp. 269-315. Anti-<br>
ErbB2 antibody scFv fragments are described in WO93/16185; U.S. Patent No. 5,571,894; and U.S. Patent<br>
No. 5,587,458.<br>
The term "diabodies" refers to small antibody fragments with two antigen-binding sites, which<br>
fragments comprise a variable heavy domain (VH) connected to a variable light domain (VL) in the same<br>
polypeptide chain (VH - VL). By using a linker that is too short to allow pairing between the two domains on<br>
the same chain, the domains are forced to pair with the complementary domains of another chain and create<br>
two antigen-binding sites. Diabodies are described more fully in, for example, EP 404,097; WO 93/11161;<br>
and Hollinger et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 90: 6444-6448 (1993).<br>
"Humanized" forms of non-human (e.g., rodent) antibodies are chimeric antibodies that contain<br>
minimal sequence derived from non-human immunoglobulin. For the most part, humanized antibodies are<br>
human immunoglobulins (recipient antibody) in which residues from a hypervariable region of the recipient<br>
are replaced by residues from a hypervariable region of a non-human species (donor antibody), such as<br>
mouse, rat. rabbit, or non-human primate having the desired specificity, affinity, and capacity. In some<br>
instances, framework region (FR) residues of the human immunoglobulin are replaced by corresponding<br>
non-human residues. Furthermore, humanized antibodies may comprise residues that are not found in the<br>
recipient antibody or in the donor antibody. These modifications are made to further refine antibody<br>
performance. In general, the humanized antibody will comprise substantially all of at least one, and<br>
typically two, variable domains, in which all or substantially all of the hypervariable loops correspond to<br>
those of a non-human immunoglobulin, and all or substantially all of the FRs are those of a human<br>
immunoglobulin sequence. The humanized antibody optionally also will comprise at least a portion of an<br>
immunoglobulin constant region (Fc), typically that of a human immunoglobulin. For further details, see<br>
Jones et al.. Nature, 321: 522-525 (1986); Riechmann el al.. Nature, 332: 323-329 (1988); and Presta. Curr.<br>
Op. Struct. BioL 2: 593-596 (1992).<br>
An "isolated" antibody is one that has been identified and separated and/or recovered from a<br>
component of its natural environment. Contaminant components of its natural environment are materials<br>
that would interfere with diagnostic or therapeutic uses for the antibody, and may include enzymes,<br>
hormones, and other proteinaceous or non-proteinaceous solutes. In preferred embodiments, the antibody<br>
will be purified (I) to greater than 95% by weight of antibody as determined by the Lowry method, and most<br>
preferably more than 99% by weight, (2) to a degree sufficient to obtain at least 15 residues of N-terminal or<br>
internal amino acid sequence by use of a spinning cup sequenator, or (3) to homogeneity by SDS-PAGE<br>

under reducing or non-reducing conditions using Coomassie blue or, preferably, silver stain. Isolated<br>
antibody includes the antibody in situ within recombinant cells, since at least one component of the<br>
antibody's natural environment will not be present. Ordinarily, however, isolated antibody will be prepared<br>
by at least one purification step.<br>
A "leucine zipper" is a peptide (often about 20-40 amino acid residues long) having several<br>
repeating amino acids, in which every seventh amino acid is a leucine residue. Such leucine zipper<br>
sequences form amphipathic alpha-helices, with the leucine residues lined up on the hydrophobic side for<br>
dimer formation. Examples of leucine zippers herein include the Fos-Jun leucine zipper (O'Shea-et a/..<br>
Science, 245: 646 (1989)), which may be used for forming heterodimers (e.g.. bispecific antibodies); the<br>
GCN4 leucine zipper from yeast (Landschulz el a/., Science, 240: 1759-1764 (1988)) which may be used for<br>
forming homodimers (e.g.. monospecific antibodies); and leucine zippers found in other DNA-binding<br>
proteins, such as C/EBP and c-myc, as well as variants of any of these.<br>
The expression "control sequences" refers to DNA sequences necessary for the expression of an<br>
operably linked coding sequence in a particular host organism. The control sequences that are suitable for<br>
bacteria include a promoter, optionally an operator sequence, and a ribosome-binding site.<br>
Nucleic acid is "operably linked" when it is placed into a functional relationship with another<br>
nucleic acid sequence. For example, DNA for a presequence or secretory leader is operably linked to DNA<br>
for a polypeptide if it is expressed as a preprotein that participates in the secretion of the polypeptide; a<br>
promoter is operably linked to a coding sequence if it affects the transcription of the sequence; or a ribosome<br>
binding site is operably linked to a coding sequence if it is positioned so as to facilitate translation.<br>
Generally, "operably linked" means that the DNA sequences being linked are contiguous, and, in the case of<br>
a secretory leader, contiguous and in reading phase. Linking is accomplished, for example, by ligation at<br>
convenient restriction sites. If such sites do not exist, the synthetic oligonucleotide adaptors or linkers are<br>
used in accordance with conventional practice.<br>
The term "recovery" of a polypeptide generally means obtaining the polypeptide free from the cells<br>
in which it was produced.<br>
"Host cell impurities" means contaminating host proteins and other biomolecular impurities such as<br>
DNA and cell debris in the fermentation broth or homogenate.<br>
Modes for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
The invention provides in one aspect a method for purifying a desired heterologous polypeptide<br>
from a microbial fermentation broth or homogenate in which it is produced and solubilized. The polypeptide<br>
may already be produced in a soluble fraction, or it may be insoluble (e.g., produced in an insoluble fraction,<br>
phase, or form) and therefore contacted or treated so as to dissolve the polypeptide. If the polypeptide is<br>
produced in an insoluble state, it is solubilized by exposure to or contact with a solubilizing agent (as noted<br>
above) before the ethacridine lactate is added, for example, adding such agent to a fraction containing the<br>
insoluble polypeptide. It is preferred that the polypeptide is already in the soluble fraction. The method<br>
herein involves adding to the broth or homogenate an effective amount of a solution of ethacridine lactate to<br>
precipitate host cell impurities contained in the broth or homogenate. Such addition takes place under<br>
conditions wherein the majority of the polypeptide remains soluble. In the next step the desired polypeptide<br>
is separated from the broth or homogenate. including cell debris, host cell protein, DNA, RNA, etc.<br>
15<br><br>
Attorney Docket No: P1941R1<br>
Because most host proteins precipitated by the ethacridine lactate have a negative charge while the<br>
target polypeptide has a positive surface charge, it is preferred that the target polypeptide have a higher.p1<br>
than the average p1 of host proteins contained in the host cell impurities, so that it can be recovered in the<br>
supernatant from the precipitated host proteins. Such average p1 can be determined by a 2-D gel of the host<br>
proteins, wherein, for example, the band of p1 ranges from about 7.5 to 5.0, the average being 6.25.<br>
Alternatively, isoelectrofocusing alone (which is the first dimension on a 2-D gel) can be used for this<br>
determination, as well as chromatofocusing, and calculations by amino acid composition. The more<br>
preferred polypeptides are those having a p1 of at least about 7, and preferably about 7-10.<br>
The preferred polypeptides to be employed are set forth above.<br>
The concentration of ethacridine lactate employed is dependent, for example, on the amount of<br>
negative charges in solution, which are on the surface of most host cell impurities present in the solution.<br>
Hence, the ethacridine lactate concentration depends at least on the amount of host cell impurities such as<br>
the DNA and host protein concentration in the solution. The higher the concentration of host protein and<br>
DNA in the homogenate, the higher the amount of ethacridine lactate required. Hence, the more negatively<br>
charged components available for the ethacridine lactate to complex with and thus precipitate, the higher<br>
amount of ethacridine lactate needed to maximize precipitation. The preferred concentration of ethacridine<br>
lactate is generally more than about 0.1% weight/volume. More preferred is an ethacridine lactate<br>
concentration of about 0.1-5%, still more preferred about 0.4-5%, and most preferably about 0.6-5%<br>
weight/volume.<br>
In general, the lower the conductivity of the solution when performing the precipitation, the more<br>
efficient the purification of the polypeptide from the cell debris and DNA. The conductivity can be<br>
controlled, for example, by the amount of salt in the homogenate or broth or by diluting the homogenate or<br>
broth with water or other suitable solvent. It is preferred that the conductivity of the broth or homogenate<br>
after addition of the ethacridine lactate is less than about 16 milliSiemens (mS), more preferably about 1-15<br>
mS, still more preferably about 1-10 mS, and most preferably about 1-5 mS.<br>
The conductivity of the solution during the precipitation will depend at least in part on the type of<br>
salt present therein. Halides (e.g., chlorides or bromides) are not preferred anions for the salts, but if they<br>
are present, they are preferably at a concentration of less than about 100 mM in solution before adding the<br>
ethacridine lactate, and below about 50 mM once the ethacridine lactate is added. Some exemplary salts to<br>
employ herein include buffer salts, TR1S, MES, MOPS, acetate, and citrate.   The concentration of salts<br>
present must not be above an amount that would precipitate the ethacridine lactate.   The exact amount is<br>
dependent mainly on the type of salt and the stoichiometry between the salt and ethacridine lactate, and the<br>
limit is at the low end of the stoichiometry, i.e., the low end means more salt relative to the ethacridine<br>
lactate.<br>
The pH of the broth or homogenate after addition of the ethacridine lactate depends, for example,<br>
on the p1 of the polypeptide, the amount of negative surface charges on the polypeptide, the amount of host<br>
cell impurities in the solution, and the concentration of ethacridine lactate. The pH is preferably not higher<br>
than the p1 of the polypeptide. Generally, the pH range is about 4-10; however, for efficient host cell<br>
impurity precipitation, the pH of the broth or homogenate after addition of the ethacridine lactate is<br>
preferably no greater than about 9, since the ethacridine lactate becomes less charged above this pH. with the<br>
16<br><br>
Attorney Docket No: P1941R1<br>
preferred range of about 4-9. More preferably the pH of the broth or homogenate after addition of the<br>
ethacridine lactate is about 5-9. and still more preferably, about 6-9. The more negative surface charges on<br>
the polypeptide. the lower the pH within this range, with a preferred range for such polypeptides of about pH<br>
6-7.<br>
The broth or homogenate after addition of the ethacridine lactate optionally is incubated at an<br>
elevated temperature for a period of time. Whether to raise the temperature and for how long depends on<br>
many factors, including the type of polypeptide of interest, what, if any, modifications to the polypeptide of<br>
interest occur if exposed to elevated temperature during this period in the process, etc. For example, for the<br>
anti-tissue factor F(ab')2 purifications, elevated temperatures are preferred, whereas for full-length antibody,<br>
it is preferred to have no heat or have the temperature no higher than about 25°C. With these factors in<br>
mind, in general, the temperature of the broth or homogenate after addition of the ethacridine lactate ranges<br>
from about room temperature to about 70°C, more preferably, from about room temperature to about 65°C<br>
held for about 1-60 minutes. If the temperature should be elevated, one preferred range is from about 50 to<br>
65°C held for about 1-60 minutes.<br>
In another aspect, the invention provides a composition of matter that is a fermentation broth or<br>
homogenate from microbial cells comprising ethacridine lactate and heterologous polypeptide.   Preferably,<br>
the polypeptide is dissolved in such broth or homogenate. The cells, polypeptide, concentration, and<br>
conditions for the broth or homogenate are as indicated above. The dissolution degree of the polypeptide<br>
can be determined by an appropriate assay such as the assays as noted above. Culturing parameters are used<br>
and polypeptide production is conducted in a conventional manner, such as those procedures described<br>
below.<br>
A. Selection of Nucleic Acid and Modifications Thereof<br>
While the polypeptide herein, such as an antibody, may be produced from any source (e.g., peptic<br>
cleavage of intact antibodies), preferably it is made recombinantly. The nucleic acid encoding the<br>
polypeptide of interest is suitably RNA, cDNA, or genomic DNA from any source, provided it encodes the<br>
polypeptide(s) of interest. Methods are well known for selecting the appropriate nucleic acid for expression<br>
of heterologous polypeptides (including varianis thereof) in microbial hosts. Selection of appropriate<br>
nucleic acid to prepare non-antibody polypeptides in microbial cell culture is well known in the art.<br>
If monoclonal antibodies are being produced, DNA encoding the monoclonal antibodies is readily<br>
isolated and sequenced using conventional procedures (e.g., by using oligonucleotide probes that are capable<br>
of binding specifically to genes encoding the heavy and light chains of murine antibodies). The hybridoma<br>
cells serve as a preferred source of such DNA. Once isolated, the DNA may be placed into expression<br>
vectors, which are then transformed into the microbial host cells herein to obtain the synthesis of monoclonal<br>
antibodies in the recombinant host cells. Review articles on recombinant expression in bacteria of DNA<br>
encoding the antibody include Skerra et al., Curr. Opinion in Immunol.. 5: 256-262 (1993) and Pluckthun,<br>
Immunal._Reys;. 130: 151-188 (1992).<br>
Methods for humanizing non-human antibodies have been described in the art. Preferably, a<br>
humanized antibody has one or more ami no acid residues introduced into it from a source that is non-human.<br>
These non-human amino acid residues are often referred to as "import" residues, which are typically taken<br>
from an "import" variable domain. Humanization can be essentially performed following the method of<br>
17<br><br>
Attorney Docket No: P1941R1<br>
Winter and co-workers (Jones et al., Nature. 321: 522-525 (1986); Riechmann et al., Nature, 332: 323-327<br>
(1988): Verhoeyen et al.. Science. 239: 1534-1536(1988)), by substituting hypervariable region sequences<br>
for the corresponding sequences of a human antibody. Accordingly, such "humanized" antibodies are<br>
chimeric antibodies (U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567) wherein substantially less than an intact human variable<br>
domain has been substituted by the corresponding sequence from a non-human species. In practice,<br>
humanized antibodies are typically human antibodies in which some hypervariable region residues and<br>
possibly some FR residues are substituted by residues from analogous sites in rodent antibodies.<br>
The choice of human variable domains, both light and heavy, to be used in making the humanized<br>
antibodies is very important to reduce antigenicity. According to the so-called "best-fit" method, the<br>
sequence of the variable domain of a rodent antibody is screened against the entire library of known human<br>
variable-domain sequences. The human sequence that is closest to that of the rodent is then accepted as the<br>
human framework region (FR) for the humanized antibody (Sims et al., J. Immunol.. 151: 2296 (1993)-;-<br>
Chothia et al., J. Mol. Biol.. 196: 901 (1987)). Another method uses a particular framework region derived<br>
from the consensus sequence of all human antibodies of a particular subgroup of light or heavy chains. The<br>
same framework may be used for several different humanized antibodies (Carter et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.<br>
USA. 89: 4285 (1992); Presta et al., J. Immunol.. 151: 2623 (1993)).<br>
It is further important that antibodies be humanized with retention of high affinity for the antigen<br>
and other favorable biological properties. To achieve this goal, according to a preferred method, humanized<br>
antibodies are prepared by a process of analysis of the parental sequences and various conceptual humanized<br>
products using three-dimensional models of the parental and humanized sequences. Three-dimensional<br>
immunoglobulin models are commonly available and are familiar to those skilled in the art. Computer<br>
programs are available that illustrate and display probable three-dimensional conformational structures of<br>
selected candidate immunoglobulin sequences. Inspection of these displays permits analysis of the likely<br>
role of the residues in the functioning of the candidate immunoglobulin sequence, i.e., the analysis of<br>
residues that influence the ability of the candidate immunoglobulin to bind its antigen. In this way, FR<br>
residues can be selected and combined from the recipient and import sequences so that the desired antibody<br>
characteristic, such as increased affinity for the target antigen(s), is achieved. In general, the hypervariable<br>
region residues are directly and most substantially involved in influencing antigen binding.<br>
Various forms of the humanized antibody or affinity-matured antibody are contemplated. For<br>
example, the humanized antibody or affinity-matured antibody may be an antibody fragment, such as a Fab.<br>
that is optionally conjugated with one or more targeting agent(s) in order to generate an immunoconjugate.<br>
Alternatively, the humanized antibody or affinity-matured antibody may be an intact antibody, such as an<br>
intact IgGl antibody.<br>
Fab'-SH fragments can be directly recovered from £ colt and chemically coupled to form F(ab')2<br>
fragments (Carter et al., Bio/Technology. 10: 163-167 (1992)). According to another approach, F(ab')2<br>
fragments can be isolated directly from recombinant host cell culture. Other techniques for the production of<br>
antibody fragments will be apparent to the skilled practitioner. In other embodiments, the antibody of choice<br>
is a single-chain Fv fragment (scFv) (WO 93/16185; U.S. Pat. Nos. 5.571,894 and 5,587,458). The antibody<br>
fragment may also be a "linear antibody", e.g., as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,641,870. Such linear antibody<br>
fragments may be monospecific or bispecific.<br>
18<br><br>
Attorney Docket No: P1941R1<br>
Bispecific antibodies are antibodies that have binding specificities for at least two different<br>
epitopes. Exemplary bispecific antibodies may bind to two different epitopes of the Dkk-1 protein.<br>
Bispecific antibodies can be prepared as full-length antibodies or antibody fragments (e.g., F(ab')2 bispecific<br>
antibodies).<br>
According to a different approach, antibody variable domains with the desired binding specificities<br>
(antibody-antigen combining sites) are fused to immunoglobulin constant-domain sequences. The fusion<br>
preferably is with an immunoglobulin heavy-chain constant domain, comprising at least part of the hinge,<br>
CH2, and CH3 regions. It is preferred to have the first heavy-chain constant region (CHI) containing the<br>
site necessary for light-chain binding, present in at least one of the fusions. DNAs encoding the<br>
immunoglobulin heavy-chain fusions and, if desired, the immunoglobulin light chain, are inserted into<br>
separate expression vectors, and are co-transfected into a suitable bacterial host organism. This provides for<br>
great flexibility in adjusting the mutual proportions of the three polypeptide fragments in embodiments when<br>
unequal ratios of the three polypeptide chains used in the construction provide the optimum yields. It is,<br>
however, possible to insert the coding sequences for two or all three polypeptide chains in one expression<br>
vector when the expression of at least two polypeptide chains in equal ratios results in high yields or when<br>
the ratios are of no particular significance.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of this approach, the bispecific antibodies are composed of a hybrid<br>
immunoglobulin heavy chain with a first binding specificity in one arm, and a hybrid immunoglobulin heavy<br>
chain-light chain pair (providing a second binding specificity) in the other arm. It was found that this<br>
asymmetric structure facilitates the separation of the desired bispecific compound from unwanted<br>
immunoglobulin chain combinations, as the presence of an immunoglobulin light chain in only one half of<br>
the bispecific molecule provides for a facile way of separation. This approach is disclosed in WO 94/04690.<br>
For further details of generating bispecific antibodies see, for example, Suresh el at.. Methods in<br>
Enzymology. 121: 210(1986).<br>
According to another approach described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,731,168, the interface between a pair of<br>
antibody molecules can be engineered to maximize the percentage of heterodimers that are recovered from<br>
recombinant cell culture. The preferred interface comprises at least a part of the CH3 domain of an antibody<br>
constant domain. In this method, one or more small amino acid side chains from the interface of the first<br>
antibody molecule are replaced with larger side chains (e.g., tyrosine or tryptophan). Compensatory<br>
"cavities" of identical or similar size to the large side chain(s) are created on the interface of the second"<br>
antibody molecule by replacing large amino acid side chains with smaller ones (e.g., alanine or threonine).<br>
This provides a mechanism for increasing the yield of the heterodimer over other unwanted end-products<br>
such as homodimers.<br>
Bispecific antibodies include cross-linked or "heteroconjugate" antibodies. For example, one of the<br>
antibodies in the heteroconjugate can be coupled to avidin, the other to biotin. Such antibodies have, for<br>
example, been proposed to target immune system cells to unwanted cells (U.S. Pat. No. 4,676,980), and for<br>
treatment of HIV infection (WO 91/00360, WO 92/200373, and EP 03089). Heteroconjugate antibodies<br>
may be made using any convenient cross-linking methods. Suitable cross-linking agents are well known in<br>
the art, and are disclosed, e.g., in U.S. Pat. No. 4,676,980, along with a number of cross-linking techniques.<br>
19<br><br>
Attorney Docket No: P1941RI<br>
Techniques for generating bispecific antibodies from antibody fragments have also been described<br>
in the literature. For example, bispecific antibodies can be prepared using chemical linkage. Brennan et al.<br>
Science. 229: 81 (1985) describe a procedure wherein intact antibodies are proteolytically cleaved to<br>
generate F(ab')2 fragments. These fragments are reduced in the presence of the dithiol complexing agent<br>
sodium arsenite to stabilize vicinal dithiols and prevent intermolecular disulfide formation. The Fab'<br>
fragments generated are then converted to thionitrobenzoate (TNB) derivatives. One of the Fab'-TNB<br>
derivatives is then reconverted to the Fab'-thiol by reduction with mercaptoethylamine and is mixed with an<br>
equimolar amount of the other Fab'-TNB derivative to form the bispecific antibody. The bispecific<br>
antibodies produced can be used as agents for the selective immobilization of enzymes.<br>
Additionally. Fab'-SH fragments can be directly recovered from E. coli and chemically coupled to<br>
form bispecific antibodies (Shalaby et al, J. Exp. Med.. 175: 217-225 (1992)).<br>
Various techniques for making and isolating bispecific antibody fragments directly from<br>
recombinant cell culture have also been described. For example, bispecific antibodies have been produced<br>
using leucine zippers (Kostelny et al, J. Immunol.. 148: 1547-1553 (1992)). The leucine zipper peptides<br>
from the Fos and Jun proteins are linked to the Fab' portions of two different antibodies by gene fusion. The<br>
antibody homodimers are reduced at the hinge region to form monomers and then re-oxidized to form the<br>
antibody heterodimers. This method can also be utilized for the production of antibody homodimers. The<br>
"diabody" technology described by Hollinger et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 90: 6444-6448 (1993) has<br>
provided an alternative mechanism for making bispecific antibody fragments. The fragments comprise a<br>
heavy-chain variable domain (VH) connected to a light-chain variable domain (VL) by a linker that is too<br>
short to allow pairing between the two domains on the same chain. Accordingly, the VH and VL domains of<br>
one fragment are forced to pair with the complementary VL and VH domains of another fragment, thereby<br>
forming two antigen-binding sites. Another strategy for making bispecific antibody fragments by the use of<br>
single-chain Fv (sFv) dimers has also been reported (Gruber et al, J. Immunol.. 152: 5368 (1994)).<br>
Antibodies with more than two valencies are contemplated. For example, trispecific antibodies can<br>
be prepared (Tutt et al., J. Immunol.. 147: 60 (1991)).<br>
Nucleic acid molecules encoding polypeptide variants are prepared by a variety of methods known<br>
in the art. These methods include, but are not limited to, isolation from a natural source (in the case of<br>
naturally occurring amino acid sequence variants) or preparation by oligonucleotide-mediated (or site-<br>
directed) mutagenesis. PCR mutagenesis, or cassette mutagenesis of an earlier prepared variant or a non-<br>
variant version of the polypeptide.<br>
It may be desirable to modify the antibody of the invention with respect to effector function, e.g.. so<br>
as to enhance Fc receptor binding. This may be achieved by introducing one or more amino acid<br>
substitutions into an Fc region of the antibody. Alternatively or additionally, cysteine residue(s) may be<br>
introduced in the Fc region, thereby allowing interchain disulfide bond formation in this region.<br>
To increase the serum half-life of the antibody, one may incorporate a salvage receptor binding<br>
epitope into the antibody (especially an antibody fragment) as described in U.S. Pat. 5,739,277, for example.<br>
As used herein, the term "salvage receptor binding epitope" refers to an epitope of the Fc region of an IgG<br>
molecule (e.g., IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, or IgG4) that is responsible for increasing the in vivo serum half-life of the<br>
IgG molecule.<br>
20<br><br>
Attorney Docket No: P1941R1<br>
Other modifications of the antibody are contemplated herein. For example, the antibody may be<br>
linked to one of a variety of non-proteinaceous polymers, e.g., polyethylene glycol, polypropylene glycol,<br>
polyoxyalkylenes. or copolymers of polyethylene glycol and polypropylene glycol.<br>
B. Insertion of Nucleic Acid Into a Replicable Vector<br>
The heterologous nucleic acid (e.g., cDNA or genomic DNA) is suitably inserted into a replicable<br>
vector for expression in the microorganism under the control of a suitable promoter. Many vectors are<br>
available for this purpose, and selection of the appropriate vector will depend mainly on the size of the<br>
nucleic acid to be inserted into the vector and the particular host cell to be transformed with the vector. Each<br>
vector contains various components depending on the particular host cell with which it is compatible.<br>
Depending on the particular type of host, the vector components generally include, but are not limited to,<br>
one or more of the following: a signal sequence, an origin of replication, one or more marker genes, a<br>
promoter, and a transcription termination sequence.<br>
In general, plasmid vectors containing replicon and control sequences that are derived from species<br>
compatible with the host cell are used in connection with microbial hosts. The vector ordinarily carries a<br>
replication site, as well as marking sequences that are capable of providing phenotypic selection in<br>
transformed cells. For example, E. coli is typically transformed using pBR322, a plasmid derived from an E.<br>
coli species (see, e.g.. Bolivar et al., Gene. 2: 95 (1977)). pBR322 contains genes for ampicillin and<br>
tetracycline resistance and thus provides easy means for identifying transformed cells. The pBR322<br>
plasmid, or other bacterial plasmid or phage, also generally contains, or is modified to contain, promoters<br>
that can be used by the host for expression of the selectable marker genes.<br>
(i) Signal Sequence Component<br>
The DNA encoding the polypeptide of interest herein may be expressed not only directly, but also<br>
as a fusion with another polypeptide, preferably a signal sequence or other polypeptide having a specific<br>
cleavage site at the N-terminus of the mature polypeptide. In general, the signal sequence may be a<br>
component of the vector, or it may be a part of the polypeptide DNA that is inserted into the vector. The<br>
heterologous signal sequence selected should be one that is recognized and processed (i.e., cleaved by a<br>
signal peptidase) by the host cell.<br>
For prokaryotic host cells that do not recognize and process the native or a eukaryotic polypeptide<br>
signal sequence, the signal sequence may be substituted by a prokaryotic signal sequence selected, for<br>
example, from the group consisting of the lamB. ompF, alkaline phosphatase, penicillinase, Ipp, or heat-<br>
stable enterotoxin II leaders. For yeast secretion the signal sequence may be, e.g., the yeast invertase leader,<br>
alpha factor leader (including Saccharomyces and Klttyveromyces -factor leaders, the latter described in U.S.<br>
Patent No. 5,010,182), or acid phosphatase leader, the C. albicans glucoamylase leader (EP 362,179<br>
published 4 April 1990), or the signal described in WO 90/13646 published 15 November 1990.<br>
(ii) Origin of Replication Component<br>
Expression vectors contain a nucleic acid sequence that enables the vector to replicate in one or<br>
more selected host cells. Such sequences are well known for a variety of microbes. The origin of replication<br>
from the plasmid pBR322 is suitable for most Gram-negative bacteria such as E. coli.<br>
(iii) Selection Gene Component<br>
21<br><br>
Attorney Docket No: P1941R1<br>
Expression vectors generally contain a selection gene, also termed a selectable marker. This gene<br>
encodes a protein necessary for the survival or growth of transformed host cells grown in a selective culture<br>
medium. Host cells not transformed with the vector containing the selection gene will not survive in the<br>
culture medium. This selectable marker is separate from the genetic markers as utilized and defined by this<br>
invention. Typical selection genes encode proteins that (a) confer resistance to antibiotics or other toxins,<br>
e.g.. ampicillin, neomycin, methotrexate, or tetracycline, (b) complement auxotrophic deficiencies other than<br>
those caused by the presence of the genetic marker(s), or (c) supply critical nutrients not available from<br>
complex media, e.g., the gene encoding D-alanine racemase for Bacilli.<br>
One example of a selection scheme utilizes a drug to arrest growth of a host cell. In this case, those<br>
cells that are successfully transformed with the nucleic acid of interest produce a polypeptide conferring<br>
drug resistance and thus survive the selection regimen. Examples of such dominant selection use the drugs<br>
neomycin (Southern et al, J. Molec. Appl. Genet.. I: 327 (1982)), mycophenolic acid (Mulligan et al..<br>
Science, 209: 1422(1980)) or hvgronrycin (Sugden et al. Mol. Cell. Biol.. 5: 410-413 (1985)). The three<br>
examples given above employ bacterial genes under eukaryotic control to convey resistance to the<br>
appropriate drug G418 or neomycin (geneticin), xgpt (mycophenolic acid), or hygromycin, respectively.<br>
(iv) Promoter Component<br>
The expression vector for producing the polypeptide of interest contains a suitable promoter that is<br>
recognized by the host organism and is operably linked to the nucleic acid encoding the polypeptide of"<br>
interest. Promoters suitable for use with prokaryotic hosts include the beta-lactamase and lactose promoter<br>
systems (Chang et al., Nature. 275: 615 (1978); Goeddel et al., Nature. 281: 544 (1979)), the arabinose<br>
promoter system (Guzman et al., J. Bacteriol.. 174: 7716-7728 (1992)), alkaline phosphatase, a tryptophan<br>
(trp) promoter system (Goeddel, Nucleic Acids Res.. 8: 4057 (1980) and EP 36,776) and hybrid promoters<br>
such as the tac promoter (deBoer et al, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 80: 21-25 (1983)). However, other<br>
known bacterial promoters are suitable. Their nucleotide sequences have been published, thereby enabling a<br>
skilled worker operably to ligate them to DNA encoding the polypeptide of interest (Siebenlist et al, Cell.<br>
20: 269 (1980)) using linkers or adaptors to supply any required restriction sites.<br>
Promoters for use in bacterial systems also generally contain a Shine-Dalgarno (S.D.) sequence<br>
operably linked to the DNA encoding the polypeptide of interest. The promoter can be removed from the<br>
bacterial source DNA by restriction enzyme digestion and inserted into the vector containing the desired<br>
DNA.<br>
Promoters suitable for use in yeast are well known in the art. Examples of suitable promoting<br>
sequences for use with yeast hosts include the promoters for 3-phosphoglycerate kinase (Hitzeman et al., L<br>
Biol. Chem., 255: 2073 (1980)) or other glycolytic enzymes (Hess el al., J. Adv. Enzyme Reg.. 7: 149<br>
(1968); Holland, Biochemistry, JJ7: 4900 (1978)), such as enolase, glyceraIdehyde-3-phosphate<br>
dehydrogenase, hexokinase, pyruvate decarboxylase, phosphofructokinase, glucose-6-phosphate isomerase,<br>
3-phosphoglycerate mutase, pyruvate kinase, triosephosphate isomerase, phosphoglucose isomerase, and<br>
glucokinase.<br>
Other yeast promoters, which are inducible promoters having the additional advantage of<br>
transcription controlled by growth conditions, are the promoter regions for alcohol dehydrogenase 2,<br>
isocytochrome C, acid phosphatase, degradative enzymes associated with nitrogen metabolism.<br>
22<br><br>
Attorney Docket No: P1941R1<br>
metallothionein, gIyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and enzymes responsible for maltose and<br>
galactose utilization. Suitable vectors and promoters for use in yeast expression are further described in EP<br>
73,657.<br>
(v) Construction and Analysis of Vectors<br>
Construction of suitable vectors containing one or more of the above-listed components employs<br>
standard ligation techniques. Isolated plasmids or DNA fragments are cleaved, tailored, and re-ligated in the<br>
form desired to generate the plasmids required.<br>
For analysis to confirm correct sequences in plasmids constructed, the ligation mixtures are used to<br>
transform E. coli KI2 strain 294 (ATCC 31,446) or other strains, and successful transformants are selected<br>
by ampicillin or tetracycline resistance where appropriate. Plasmids from the transformants are prepared,<br>
analyzed by restriction endonuclease digestion, and/or sequenced by the method of Sanger et al, Proc. Natl.<br>
Acad. Sci. USA, 74: 5463-5467 (1977) or Messing et al., Nucleic Acids Res.. 9: 309 (1981), or by the<br>
method of Maxam et al.. Methods in Enzymology, 65: 499 (1980).<br>
C. Selection and Transformation of Host Cells<br>
Suitable host cells for cloning or expressing the DNA in the vectors herein are any microbial cells,<br>
including prokaryotes and fungal cells, including yeast. Suitable prokaryotes for this purpose include<br>
bacteria as defined above, preferably eubacteria, such as Gram-negative or Gram-positive organisms.<br>
Examples include Enterobacteriaceae such as Escherichia, e.g., E. coli, Enterobacter, Erwinia, Klebsiella,<br>
Proteus, Salmonella, e.g., Salmonella typhimurium, Serratia, e.g., Serratia marcescans, andShigella, as well<br>
as Bacilli such as B. subtilis and B. licheniformis (e.g., B. licheniformis 41P disclosed in DD 266,710<br>
published Apr. 12. 1989), Pseudomonas such as P. aeruginosa, and Streptomyces. One preferred E. coli<br>
cloning host is E. coli 294 (ATCC 31, 446), although other strains such as E. coli B, E. coli X1776 (ATCC<br>
31,537), and E. coli W3110 (ATCC 27,325) are suitable. These examples are illustrative rather than limiting.<br>
Mutant cells of any of the above-mentioned strains may also be employed as the starting hosts that are then<br>
further mutated to contain at least the minimum genotype required herein.<br>
E. coli strain W3110 is a preferred parental E. coli host because it is a common host strain for<br>
recombinant DNA product fermentations. Examples of starting E. coli hosts to be used as parent hosts,<br>
along with their genotypes, are included in the table below:<br><br><br><br>
Also suitable are the intermediates in making strain 36F8, i.e., T1BA (U.S. Pat. No. 5,304,472) and 35E7 (a<br>
spontaneous temperature-resistant colony isolate growing better than 27B4). An additional suitable strain is<br>
the E. coli strain having the mutant periplasmic protease(s) disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,946,783 issued<br>
August 7, 1990.<br>
The above strains may be produced by chromosomal integration of the parental strain or other<br>
techniques, including those set forth in the Examples below.<br>
Full-length antibodies may be made in E. coli in accordance with the teachings of WO 02/061090<br>
published August 8, 2002.<br>
In addition to prokaryotes, eukaryotic microbes such as filamentous fungi or yeast are suitable<br>
expression hosts for polypeptide-encoding vectors. Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a commonly used lower<br>
eukaryotic host microorganism. Others include Schizosaccharomyces pombe (Beach and Nurse, Nature.<br>
290: 140 (1981); EP 139,383 published 2 May 1985); Kluyveromyces hosts (U.S. Patent No. 4,943.529;<br>
Fleer el al., Biotechnology, 9: 968-975 (1991)) such as, e.g., K. lactis (MW98-8C, CBS683, CBS4574;<br>
Louvencourt et a/., J. Bacteriol.. 737 (1983)), K.fragilis (ATCC 12,424), K. bulgaricus (ATCC 16,045), K.<br>
wickeramii (ATCC 24,178), K. wallii (ATCC 56,500), K. drosophi/arum (ATCC 36,906; Van den Berg el<br>
a/.. Biotechnology. 8: 135 (1990)), A'. thermotolerans. and K. marxianus; yarrowia (EP 402,226): Pichia<br>
pastoris (EP 183,070; Sreekrishna el at., J. Basic Microbiol., 28: 265-278 (1988)); Candida; Trichoderma<br>
reesia (EP 244,234); Neurospora crassa (Case et at., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 76: 5259-5263 (1979));<br>
Sclwanniomyces such as Schwanniomyces occidentals (EP 394,538 published 31 October 1990); and<br>
filamentous fungi such as, e.g., Neurospora, Penicillium, Tolypocladium (WO 91/00357 published 10<br>
24<br><br>
Attorney Docket No: P1941R1<br>
January 1991), and Aspergillus hosts sucli as A. nidulans (Ballance el al., Biochcm. Biophys. Res.<br>
Commun., .112: 284-289 (1983); Tilbum et al.. Gene. 26: 205-221 (1983): Yd Ion el al.. Proc, Natl, Acad.<br>
Sci,_USA- 81: 1470-1474 (1984)) and A. niger (Kelly and Hynes, EMBOJ., 4: 475-479 (1985)).<br>
Methylotropic yeasts are suitable herein and include, but are not limited to, yeast capable of growth on<br>
methanol selected from the genera consisting of Hansenula, Candida, Kloeckera, Pichia, Saccharomyces,<br>
Torulopsis. and Rhodotorula. A list of specific species that are exemplary of this class of yeasts may be<br>
found in C. Anthony. The Biochemistry of Methylotrophs. 269 (1982).<br>
The nucleic acid encoding the polypeptide is inserted into the host cells. Preferably, this is<br>
accomplished by transforming the host cells with the above-described expression vectors and culturing in<br>
conventional nutrient media modified as appropriate for inducing the various promoters.<br>
Depending on the host cell used, transformation is done using standard techniques appropriate to<br>
such cells. The calcium treatment employing calcium chloride, as described in section 1.82 of Sambrook et<br>
al, Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual (New York: Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 1989), is<br>
generally used for prokaryotic cells or other cells that contain substantial cell-wall barriers. Another method<br>
for transformation employs polyethylene glycol/DMSO, as described in Chung and Miller, Nucleic Acids<br>
Res_. 16: 3580 (1988). Transformations into yeast are typically carried out according to the method of Van<br>
Solingen el al.. J.Bact, 130:946 (1977) and Hsiao el al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. (USA). 76:3829 (1979).<br>
However, other methods for introducing DNA into cells, such as by nuclear microinjection, electroporation.<br>
bacterial protoplast fusion with intact cells, or polycations, e.g., polybrene, polyornithine, may also be used.<br>
P. Culturing the Host Cells<br>
Prokaryotic cells used to produce the polypeptides of the invention are grown in media known in<br>
the art and suitable for culture of the selected host cells, including the media generally described by<br>
Sambrook et al., supra. Media that are suitable for bacteria include, but are not limited to, AP5 medium,<br>
nutrient broth, Luria-Bertani (LB) broth, Neidhardt's minimal medium, and C.R.A.P. minimal or complete<br>
medium, plus necessary nutrient supplements. In preferred embodiments, the media also contains a selection<br>
agent, chosen based on the construction of the expression vector, to selectively permit growth of prokaryotic<br>
cells containing the expression vector. For example, ampiciHin is added to media for growth of cells<br>
expressing ampicillin resistant gene. Any necessary supplements besides carbon, nitrogen, and inorganic<br>
phosphate sources may also be included at appropriate concentrations introduced alone or as a mixture with<br>
another supplement or medium such as a complex nitrogen source. Optionally the culture medium may<br>
contain one or more reducing agents selected from the group consisting of glutathione, cysteine, cystamine.<br>
thioglycollate, dithioerythritol, and dithiothreitol.<br>
Examples of suitable media are given in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,304,472 and 5,342,763. C.R.A.P.<br>
phosphate-limiting media consists of 3.57g (NH4)2(SO4), 0.71g NaCitrate-2H2O, l.07g K.CI, 5.36g Yeast<br>
Extract (certified), 5.36g HycaseSF™-Sheffield, adjusted pH with KOH to 7.3, qs to 872 ml with SQ H2O<br>
and autoclaved; cooled to 55° C and supplemented with 110 ml 1 M MOPS pH 7.3, 11 ml 50% glucose, 7 ml<br>
1M MgSO4). Carbenicillin may then be added to the induction culture at a concentration of 50ug/ml<br>
The prokaryotic host cells are cultured at suitable temperatures. For E. coli growth, for example,<br>
the preferred temperature ranges from about 20°C to about 39°C, more preferably from about 25°C to about<br>
37°C, even more preferably at about 30°C.<br>
25<br><br>
Attorney Docket No: P1941R1<br>
Where the alkaline phosphatase promoter is employed, E. coli cells used to produce the polypeptide<br>
of interest of this invention are cultured in suitable media in which the alkaline phosphatase promoter can be<br>
partially or completely induced as described generally, e.g., in Sambrook el al.. supra. The culturing need<br>
never take place in the absence of inorganic phosphate or at phosphate starvation levels. At first, the<br>
medium contains inorganic phosphate in an amount above the level of induction of protein synthesis and<br>
sufficient for the growth of the bacterium. As the cells grow and utilize phosphate, they decrease the level of<br>
phosphate in the medium, thereby causing induction of synthesis of the polypeptide.<br>
If the promoter is an inducible promoter, for induction to occur, typically the cells are cultured until<br>
a certain optical density is achieved, e.g., a A55O of about 200 using a high cell density process, at which<br>
point induction is initiated (e.g., by addition of an inducer, by depletion of a medium component, etc.), to<br>
induce expression of the gene encoding the polypeptide of interest.<br>
Any necessary supplements may also be included at appropriate concentrations that would be<br>
known to those skilled in the art, introduced alone or as a mixture with another supplement or medium such<br>
as a complex nitrogen source. The pH of the medium may be any pH from about 5-9, depending mainly on<br>
the host organism. For E. coli, the pH is preferably from about 6.8 to about 7.4, and more preferably about<br>
7.0.<br>
One selective media that can be used for culturing yeast is a synthetic complete dextrose agar<br>
lacking uracil (SCD-Ura) prepared as described in Kaiser et al., Methods in Yeast Genetics (Cold Spring<br>
Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY, 1994), p. 208-210.<br>
E.	Detecting Expression<br>
Gene expression may be measured in a sample directly, for example, by conventional Southern<br>
blotting, northern blotting to quantitate the transcription of mRNA (Thomas, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 77:<br>
5201-5205 (1980)), dot blotting (DNA analysis), or in situ hybridization, using an appropriately labeled<br>
probe, based on the sequences of the polypeptide. Various labels may be employed, most commonly<br>
radioisotopes, particularly 32P. However, other techniques may also be employed, such as using biotin-<br>
modified nucleotides for introduction into a polynucleotide. The biotin then serves as the site for binding to<br>
avidin or antibodies, which may be labeled with a wide variety of labels, such as radionuclides, fluorescers.<br>
enzymes, or the like. Alternatively, assays or gels may be employed for detection of protein.<br>
F.	Purification of Polvpeptides<br>
When using recombinant techniques, the polypeptide herein is produced intracellularly or in the<br>
periplasmic space. If the polypeptide is produced intracellularly, as a first step, the particulate debris, either<br>
host cells or lysed cells (e.g. resulting from homogenization), is removed, for example, by centrifugation or<br>
ultrafiltration, to produce a cell broth or homogenale.<br>
Then, in accordance with this invention, the cellular impurities as defined above are removed from<br>
the homogenate or broth by precipitation using the ethacridine lactate under the conditions as set forth<br>
above, and the resulting mixture is treated so that the polypeptide of interest, in soluble form, is recovered.<br>
The separation of the target polypeptide from the broth or homogenate may be accomplished by any-<br>
suitable means, including those well known in the art such as centrifugation and filtration. Preferably, the<br>
separation is performed using centrifugation or tangential flow filtration, for example, using a filter of about<br>
300 kiloDaltons to 1 micron.<br>
26<br><br>
Attorney Docket No: P1941R1<br>
After the polypeptide is separated from the broth or homogenate. it may be purified by any known<br>
means, including chromatography or filtration such as ultrafiltration/diafiltration or tangential flow filtration.<br>
In particular, the following procedures, individually or in combination, are exemplary of suitable purification<br>
procedures, with the specific method(s) used being dependent on the type of polypeptide: immobilized metal<br>
affinity chromatography (IMAC), aqueous two-phase separation (ATPS), fractionation on immunoaffinity or<br>
ion-exchange columns: ethanol precipitation; reversed-phase HPLC; hydrophobic-interaction<br>
chromatography (HIC) chromatography on silica; chromatography on an ion-exchange resin such as S-<br>
SEPHAROSE™ and DEAE; chromatofocusing; SDS-PAGE; ammonium-sulfate precipitation;<br>
ultraflltration/diafiltration, tangential flow filtration, and gel filtration using, for example, SEPHADEX™G-<br>
75.<br>
For example, as part of the overall recovery process for the protein, the polypeptide may be<br>
exposed to an immobilized reagent that binds to or modifies the polypeptide. Thus, the polypeptide may be<br>
subjected to affinity chromatography wherein an immobilized reagent that binds specifically to the<br>
polypeptide, such as an antibody, captures the antibody and impurities pass through the affinity<br>
chromatography column. The polypeptide can be subsequently eluted from the column by changing the<br>
conditions such that the polypeptide no longer binds to the immobilized reagent. The immobilized reagent<br>
may also be an enzyme such as a protease that modifies the polypeptide (Sahni et al., Anal. Biochem.. 193:<br>
178-185 (1991) and Voyksner etal., Anal. Biochem.. 188: 72-81 (1990)).<br>
Another type of purification process is filtration. Filtration of fine particle size contaminants from<br>
fluids has been accomplished by the use of various porous filter media through which a contaminated<br>
composition is passed such that the filter retains the contaminant. Retention of the contaminant may occur<br>
by mechanical straining or electrokinetic particle capture and adsorption. In mechanical straining, a particle<br>
is retained by physical entrapment when it attempts to pass through a pore smaller than itself. In the case of<br>
electrokinetic capture mechanisms, the particle collides with a surface within the porous filter and is retained<br>
on the surface by short-range attractive forces. To achieve electrokinetic capture, charge-modifying systems<br>
can be used to alter the surface charge characteristics of a filter (see, e.g., WO 90/11814). For example,<br>
where the contaminant to be removed is anionic, a cationic charge modifier can be used to alter the charge<br>
characteristics of the filter such that the contaminant is retained by the filter.<br>
Monoclonal antibodies may be suitably separated from the precipitants by conventional antibody<br>
purification procedures such as, for example, gel filtration or electrophoresis, dialysis, HIC, affinity<br>
chromatography, e.g. protein-A SEPHAROSE™, protein-G, antigen-affinity or anti-IgG affinity<br>
chromatography, homogenization, clarification by filtration of centrifugation, precipitation, e.g. by treatment<br>
with ammonium sulfate. polyethylene glycol or caprylic acid, ion-exchange chromatography, e.g. using<br>
resins such as hydroxyapatite, e.g., resins containing calcium-phosphate such as ceramic-hydroxyapatite and<br>
BIOGEL HT™, and anion-exchange resins including those having a positively charged moiety (at neutral<br>
pH). such as diethylaminoethane (DEAE). polyethyleneimine (PEI), and quaternary aminoethane (QAE). for<br>
example, Q-SEPHAROSE FAST FLOW™ resin (Pharmacia), DEAE-SEPHAROSE FAST FLOW™ resin,<br>
DEAE-TOYOPEARL™ resin, QAE-TOYOPEARL™ resin, POROS-Q™ resin, FRACTOGEL-DMAE™<br>
resin, FRACTOGEL EMD-TMAE™ resin, MATREX CELLUFINE DEAE™, and the like.   Methods for<br>
27<br><br>
Attorney Docket No: P1941R1<br>
isolating and purifying antibodies are further described in Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual"; Harlow and<br>
Lane. eds. (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratories, New York: 1988).<br>
In one specific embodiment, the recovery step involves exposing the solubilized polypeptide to a<br>
solid phase to which is immobilized a reagent that binds to, or modifies, the polypeptide. In one<br>
embodiment, the solid phase is packed in a column and the immobilized reagent captures the polypeptide. In<br>
another embodiment, the reagent chemically and/or physically modifies the polypeptide and is immobilized<br>
on the solid phase that is. e.g., packed in a column, and the composition is passed through the column. For<br>
example, the polypeptide may comprise a precursor domain that the immobilized reagent removes as part of<br>
the recovery process, e.g., the precursor polypeptide is an antibody with a leucine zipper dimerization<br>
domain, which is removed by immobilized pepsin in the recovery process.<br>
In this embodiment, the composition comprising the polypeptide and leached reagent (and<br>
optionally one or more further contaminants) is then passed through a filter bearing a charge that is opposite<br>
to the charge of the reagent at the pH of the composition, so as to remove leached reagent from the<br>
composition. The filter may be positively charged to remove contaminants that are negatively charged at the<br>
pH of the composition, such as acidic proteases, protein A, protein G or other reagents that can leach from<br>
affinity columns. Alternatively, the filter may be negatively charged to remove contaminants that are<br>
positively charged at the pH of the composition, such as basic proteases. Preferably, the charge<br>
characteristics of the polypeptide of interest in the composition passed through the filter are such that the<br>
polypeptide is not significantly retained by the filter and passes therethrough. The filter may be placed "in<br>
line" with the effluent treated as in the previous step (i.e., the effluent flows directly though the filter). This<br>
can be achieved by connecting the filter directly to the column effluent port, before the effluent is collected<br>
into a pool tank. The filter may be regenerated using techniques applicable to the type of filter used.<br>
HIC has also been used for purifying antibody fragments. See, for example, Inouye el al., Protein<br>
Engineering, pp. 6, 8 and 1018-1019(1993); Inouye el al., Animal Cell Technology: Basic &amp; Applied<br>
Aspects. 5: 609-616 (1993); Inouye el al.. Journal of Biochemical and Biophysical Methods. 26: 27-39<br>
(1993); Morimoto el al.. Journal of Biochemical and Biophysical Methods. 24: 107-117 (1992); and Reae/<br>
al., Journal of Cell. Biochem., Suppl. 0, Abstract No. Xl-206 (17 Part A), p. 50 (1993). HIC columns<br>
normally comprise a base matrix (e.g., cross-linked agarose or synthetic copolymer material) to which<br>
hydrophobic ligands (e.g.. alkyl or aryl groups) are coupled. Many HIC columns are available<br>
commercially. Examples include, but arc not limited to, Phenyl SEPHAROSE 6 FAST FLOW™ column<br>
with low or high substitution (Pharmacia LKB Biotechnology, AB, Sweden); Phenyl SEPHAROSE™ High<br>
Performance column (Pharmacia LKB Biotechnology, AB, Sweden); Octyl SEPHAROSE™ High<br>
Performance column (Pharmacia LKB Biotechnology, AB, Sweden); FRACTOGEL™ EMD Propyl or<br>
FRACTOGEL™ EMD Phenyl columns (E. Merck, Germany); MACRO-PREP™ Methyl or MACRO-<br>
PREP™ t-Butyl Supports (Bio-Rad, California); WP Hl-Propyl (C 3 )™ column (J. T. Baker, New Jersey);<br>
and TOYOPEARL™ ether, phenyl or butyl columns (TosoHaas, PA).<br>
Examples of batch hydrophobic chromatography matrices are well known in the art and include C18<br>
alkyl chains linked to a support matrix such as SEPHAROSE   , agarose, or silica, e.g., butyl, phenyl, or<br>
octyl SEPHAROSE™. or polymers such as cellulose or polystyrene. US Pat. No. 6,214,984 describes use of<br>
low-pH hydrophobic interaction chromatography (LPH1C) for antibody and antibody fragment purification.<br>
28<br><br>
Attorney Docket No: P1941R1<br>
This method is particularly useful for purifying antibody fragments, especially correctly folded and disulflde<br>
linked antibody fragments (e.g.. Fab fragments) from contaminating antibody fragments that are not<br>
correctly folded and/or disulfide linked.   Prior to LPH1C, the antibody composition prepared from the cells<br>
is preferably subjected to at least one purification step, with examples including hydroxyapatite<br>
chromatography. gel electrophoresis, dialysis, and affinity chromatography. The suitability of protein A as<br>
an affinity ligand depends on the species and isotype of any immunoglobulin Fc domain that is present in the<br>
antibody. Protein A can be used to purify antibodies that are based on certain human heavy chains<br>
(Lindmark et a/., i. Immunol. Meth., 62: 1-13 (1983)). Protein G is recommended for all mouse isotypes<br>
and for one human isotype (Guss el al., EMBOJ.. 5: 1567-1575 (1986)). The matrix to which the affinity<br>
ligand is attached is most often agarose, but other matrices are available. Mechanically stable matrices such<br>
as controlled pore glass or poly(styrenedivinyl)benzene allow for faster flow rates and shorter processing<br>
times than can be achieved with agarose. Where the antibody comprises a CH 3 domain, the BAKERBOND<br>
ABX™ resin (J. T. Baker, Phillipsburg, N.I.) is useful for purification. Other techniques for protein<br>
purification such as fractionation on an ion-exchange column, ethanol precipitation, reverse-phase HPLC,<br>
chromatography on silica, chromatography on heparin SEPHAROSE™, chromatography on an anion- or<br>
cation-exchange resin (such as a polyaspartic acid column), chromatofocusing, SDS-PAGE, and ammonium<br>
sulfate precipitation are also available depending on the antibody to be recovered.<br>
G. Uses of Polypeptides<br>
The polypeptide thus recovered may be formulated in a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and is<br>
used for various diagnostic, therapeutic, or other uses known for such molecules. For example, antibodies<br>
described herein can be used in immunoassays, such as enzyme immunoassays.<br>
Therapeutic uses for the polypeptides purified using the method described herein are also<br>
contemplated. For example, a growth factor or hormone can be used to enhance growth as desired, and an<br>
antibody can be used for redirected cytotoxicity (e.g., to kill tumor cells), as a vaccine adjuvant, for<br>
delivering thrombolytic agents to clots, for delivering immunotoxins to tumor cells, for converting enzyme<br>
activated prodrugs at a target site (e.g., a tumor), for treating infectious diseases, or for targeting immune<br>
complexes to cell surface receptors.<br>
Therapeutic formulations of the polypeptide are prepared for storage by mixing the polypeptide<br>
having the desired degree of purity with optional physiologically acceptable carriers, excipients, or<br>
stabilizers (Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences. 16th edition, Osol, A., Ed., (1980)), in the form of ""<br>
lyophilized cake or aqueous solutions.<br>
Acceptable carriers, excipients, or stabilizers are non-toxic to recipients at the dosages and<br>
concentrations employed, and include buffers such as phosphate, citrate, and other organic acids;<br>
antioxidants including ascorbic acid; low molecular weight (less than about 10 residues) polypeptides;<br>
proteins, such as serum albumin, gelatin, or immunoglobulins; hydrophilic polymers such as<br>
polyvinylpyrrolidone; amino acids such as glycine, glutamine, asparagine, arginine or lysine;<br>
monosaccharides, disaccharides, and other carbohydrates including glucose, mannose, or dextrins; chelating<br>
agents such as EDTA; sugar alcohols such as mannitol or sorbitol; salt-forming counterions such as sodium;<br>
and/or nonionic surfactants such as TWEEN™, PLURONICS™, or polyethylene glycol (PEG).<br>
29<br><br>
Attorney Docket No: P1941R1<br>
The polypeptide also may be entrapped in microcapsules prepared, for example, by coacervation<br>
techniques or by interfacial polymerization (for example, hydroxymethylcellulose or gelatin-microcapsules<br>
and poly-(methylmethacylate) microcapsules, respectively), in colloidal drug delivery systems (for example,<br>
liposomes. albumin microspheres. microemulsions, nano-particles and nanocapsules), or in macroemulsions.<br>
Such techniques are disclosed in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, supra.<br>
The polypeptide to be used for in vivo administration must be sterile. This is readily accomplished<br>
by filtration through sterile filtration membranes, prior to or following lyophilization and reconstitutiort.The<br>
antibody ordinarily will be stored in lyophilized form or in solution.<br>
Therapeutic polypeptide compositions generally are placed into a container having a sterile access<br>
port, for example, an intravenous solution bag or vial having a stopper pierceable by a hypodermic injection<br>
needle.<br>
The route of polypeptide administration is in accord with known methods, e.g., injection or infusion<br>
by intravenous, intraperitoneal, intracerebral, intramuscular, intraocular, intraarterial, or intralesional routes,<br>
or by sustained-release systems as noted below. The polypeptide is administered continuously by infusion or<br>
by bolus injection.<br>
Suitable examples of sustained-release preparations include semipermeable matrices of solid<br>
hydrophobic polymers containing the polypeptide, which matrices are in the form of shaped articles, e.g.,<br>
films, or microcapsules. Examples of sustained-release matrices include polyesters, hydrogels (e.g., poly(2-<br>
hydroxyethyl-methacrylate) as described by Langer el al., J. Biomed. Mater. Res., 15: 167-277 (1981) and<br>
Langer, Chem. Tech.. 12: 98-105 (1982) or poly(vinylalcohol)), polylactides (U.S. Pat. No. 3,773,919, EP<br>
58,481), copolymers of L-glutamic acid and gamma ethyl-L-glutamate (Sidman el al., Biopolymers. 22:<br>
547-556 (1983)), non-degradable ethylene-vinyl acetate (Langer el al., supra), degradable lactic acid-<br>
glycolic acid copolymers such as the LUPRON DEPOT™ (injectable microspheres composed of lactic acid-<br>
glycolic acid copolymer and leuprolide acetate), and poly-D-(-)-3-hydroxybutyric acid (EP 133,988).<br>
While polymers such as ethylene-vinyl acetate and lactic acid-glycolic acid enable release of<br>
molecules for over 100 days, certain hydrogels release proteins for shorter time periods. When, for example,<br>
encapsulated antibodies remain in the body for a long time, they may denature or aggregate as a result of<br>
exposure to moisture at 37°C, resulting in a loss of biological activity and possible changes in<br>
immunogenicity. Rational strategies can be devised for antibody stabilization depending on the mechanism<br>
involved. For example, if the aggregation mechanism is discovered to be intermolecular S--S bond formation<br>
through thio-disulfide interchange, stabilization may be achieved by modifying sulfhydryl residues,<br>
lyophilizing from acidic solutions, controlling moisture content, using appropriate additives, and developing<br>
specific polymer matrix compositions.<br>

An effective amount of polypeptide to be employed therapeutically will depend, for example, upon<br>
the therapeutic objectives, the route of administration, and the condition of the patient. Accordingly, it will<br>
be necessary for the therapist to titer the dosage and modify the route of administration as required to obtain<br>
the most beneficial therapeutic effect. A typical daily dosage might range from about 1 µg/kg to up to 10<br>
mg/kg or more, depending on the factors mentioned above. Typically, the clinician will administer<br>
polypeptide until a dosage is reached that achieves the desired effect. The progress of this therapy is easily<br>
monitored by conventional assays.<br>

EXAMPLE 1<br>
Materials and Methods<br>
A. Plasmids. Transformation. Fermentation<br>
1. Production of rhuFab'2 (xCD 18)<br>
a. Plasmid Construction<br>
The control plasmid, pSl 130, was designed for the dicistronic expression of anti-CD18 F(ab')2 and<br>
it was based on the vector described by Carter el al., Bio/Technology. JO: 163-167 (1992). This design<br>
places transcription of the genes for both light chain and the heavy chain fragment with a C-termina! leucine<br>
zipper under the control of a single phoA promoter. Transcription ends with a Xlo transcriptional terminator<br>
located downstream of the coding sequence for the heavy chain-leucine zipper (Scholtissek and Grosse,<br>
Nucleic Acids Res.. 15(7): 3185 (1987)). The heat stable enterotoxin II signal sequence (STII) precedes the<br>
coding sequence for each chain and directs the secretion of the polypeptide into the periplasm (Lee et al.<br>
Infect. Immun., 42: 264-268 (1983); Picken et al., Infect. Immun., 42: 269-275 (1983)). Leucine zipper was<br>
attached to the C-terminal end of heavy chain fragment to promote the dimerization of the two Fab' arms.<br>
The dual-promoter plasmid containing two separate translational units, pxCD18-7T3, temporally<br>
separates the transcription of light chain from the transcription of heavy chain. As in pSl 130, light chain<br>
remains under the control of the phoA promoter. However, in pxCD18-7T3, a Ata transcriptional terminator<br>
follows the light chain coding sequence. Downstream of this terminator, the lacll promoter was added to<br>
control the transcription of the heavy chain fragment/C-terminal leucine zipper (DeBoer et al., Proc. Natl.<br>
Acad. Sci. USA. 80: 21-25 (1983)). A second At,, transcriptional terminator follows this coding sequence.<br>
Silent codon variants of the STII signal sequence were used to direct the secretion of both chains (Simmons<br>
and Yansura, Nature Biotechnology. .14: 629-634 (1996)).<br>
A schematic comparison of the single promoter control plasmid vs. the dual-promoter plasmid is<br>
depicted in Figure 1. The expression cassette sequence of pxCD18-7T3 is provided in Figure 2 (SEQ ID<br>
NO: 1), and the amino acid sequences (SEQ ID NOS:2 and 3) from the two translational units are shown in<br>
Figures 3A (light chain) and 3B (heavy chain), respectively.<br>
b. Fermentation<br>
The host strain used in fermentation was a derivative of E. coli W3110, designated 59A7. The<br>
complete genotype of 59A7 is W3110 AflniA phoAE15 A(argF-lac)169 deoCdegP41 ilvG2096(Vaf) A/wr<br>

Attorney Docket No: P1941R1<br>
sprW148R   The 59A7 host cells were iransformed with pxCD18-7T3 plasmid and successful transformants<br>
were selected and grown in culture. An additional plasmid, pMS42l, was co-transformed along with<br>
pxCD18-7T3. This additional plasmid, pMS421, is a pSClOl-based plasmid which provides laclq to <br>
improve control of the tac/I promoter, and which also confers spectinomycin and streptomycin resistance.<br>
For each 10-liter fermentation, a single vial containing 1.5 ml of culture in 10-15% DMSO was<br>
thawed into a 1-L shake flask containing 500 ml of LB medium supplemented with 0.5 ml of tetracycline<br>
solution (5 mg/ml) and 2.5 ml 1M sodium phosphate solution. This seed culture was grown for<br>
approximately 16 hours at 30°C and was then used to inoculate a 10-liter fermentor.<br>
The fermentor initially started with approximately 6.5 liters of medium containing about 4.4 g of<br>
glucose, 100 ml of 1M magnesium sulfate, 10 ml of a trace element solution (100 ml hydrochloric acid, 27 g<br>
ferric chloride hexahydrate, 8 g zinc sulfate heptahydrate, 7 g cobalt chloride hexahydrate, 7 g sodium<br>
molybdate dihydrate. 8 g cupric sulfate pentahydrate, 2 g boric acid, 5 g manganese sulfate monohydrate, in<br>
a final volume of 1 liter). 20 ml of a tetracycline solution (5 mg/ml in ethanol), 10 ml of FERMAX Adjuvant<br>
27™ (or some equivalent anti-foam), 1 bag of HCD salts (37.5 g ammonium sulfate, 19.5 g potassium<br>
phosphate dibasic. 9.75 g sodium phosphate monobasic dihydrate, 7.5 g sodium citrate dihydrate, 11.3 g<br>
potassium phosphate monobasic), and 200 g of NZ Amine A (a protein hydrolysate). Fermentations were<br>
performed at 30 °C with 10 slpm of air flow and were controlled at a pH of 7.0 ± 0.2 (although occasional<br>
excursions beyond this range occurred in some cases). The back pressure of the fermentor and agitation rate<br>
was varied to manipulate the oxygen transfer rate in the fermentor, and, consequently, control the cellular<br>
respiration rate.<br>
Following inoculation of the fermentor with the cell-containing medium from the shake flask, the<br>
culture was grown in the fermentor to high cell densities using a computer-based algorithm to feed a<br>
concentrated glucose solution to the fermentor. Ammonium hydroxide (58% solution) and sulfuric acid<br>
(24% solution) were also fed to the fermentor as needed to control pH. Further additions of anti-foam were<br>
also used in some cases to control foaming. When the culture reached a cell density of approximately 40<br>
OD550, an additional 100 ml of 1M magnesium sulfate was added to the fermentor. Additionally, a<br>
concentrated salt feed (consisting of approximately 10 g ammonium sulfate, 26 g dibasic potassium<br>
phosphate, 13 g monobasic sodium phosphate dihydrate, 2 g sodium citrate dihydrate and 15 g monobasic<br>
potassium phosphate in 1L of water) to the fermentor was started at a rate of 2.5 ml/min when the culture<br>
reached approximately 20 OD550 and continued until approximately 1250 ml were added to the<br>
fermentation. Fermentations were typically continued for 72-80 hours.<br>
During the fermentation, once the dissolved oxygen setpoint for the fermentation was reached, the<br>
concentrated glucose solution was fed based on the dissolved oxygen probe signal in order to control the<br>
dissolved oxygen concentration at the setpoint. Consequently, in this control scheme, manipulations of<br>
fermentor operating parameters such as the agitation rate or back pressure, which affect the oxygen transfer<br>
capacity in the fermentation, correspondingly manipulated the oxygen uptake rate or metabolic rate of the<br>
cells.<br>
A mass spectrometer was used to monitor the composition of the off-gas from the fermentations<br>
and enabled the calculation of the oxygen uptake and carbon dioxide evolution rates in the fermentations.<br><br>
Attorney Docket No: P1941R1<br>
When the culture reached a cell density of approximately 220 OD550, the agitation was decreased<br>
from an initial rate of 1000 rpm to approximately 725 rpm over approximately 12 hours. Fifty ml of 200<br>
mM of isopropyl p-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) was added to induce heavy chain synthesis<br>
approximately 12 hours after the culture reached a cell density of 220 OD550.<br>
2.	Production of Anti-Tissue Factor F(ab')2<br>
a.	Plasmid Construction<br>
A dual promoter plasmid, pxTF7T3, was created similar to the dual promoter plasmid pXCD18-<br>
7T3 set forth above, and used to enable temporal separation of anti-Tissue Factor light-chain and heavy-<br>
chain expression. The lacl sequence from the plasmid pMS421was also incorporated onto pxTF7T3 to<br>
create a new dual-promoter plasmid pJVG3IL.<br>
b.	Fermentation<br>
The host strain used in these fermentations was a derivative of E coli W3110, designated 60H4.<br>
The complete genotype of 60H4 is: W3110 A/huAAmanA phoAAEIS A(argF-lac)169 deoC2 degP4I<br>
lvG2096(Vaf) Aprc prc-siippressor.   The 60H4 host cells were transformed with pJVG3FL and successful<br>
transformants were selected and grown in culture.<br>
Fermentations were run under conditions similar to those for anti-CD18 F(ab')2 as described above,<br>
with the principal exceptions that the run length varied between approximately 72 and 114 hours, and heavy<br>
chain was induced using IPTG from approximately 4 to 12 hours following the attainment of a culture<br>
OD550 of 220.<br>
3.	Production of full-length anti-TF antibodies<br>
a. Plasmid Construction<br>
The expression cassette for the plasmid pxTF-7T3FL comprises, from 5' to 3': (1) aphoA promoter<br>
(Kikuchi el a/., Nucleic Acids Res., 9(21): 5671-5678 (1981)); (2) trp Shine-Daigarno (Yanofsky el a/.,<br>
Nucleic Acids Res.. 9: 6647-6668 (1981)); (3) a silent codon variant of the STII signal sequence (TIR<br>
relative strength about 7) (Simmons and Yansura, Nature Biotechnology. J4: 629-634 (1996)); (4) coding<br>
sequence for anti-tissue factor light chain; (5) Xto terminator (Scholtissek and Grosse, Nucleic Acids Res..<br>
15: 3185 (1987)); (6) a tacll promoter ((DeBoer el. a/., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 80: 21-25 (I983)K (7) a<br>
second trp Shine-Dalgarno; (8) a second silent codon variant of the STII signal sequence (TIR relative<br>
strength about 3); (9) coding sequence for anti-tissue factor full-length heavy chain; and (10) a second /.to<br>
terminator. This expression cassette was cloned into the framework of the E. coll plasmid pBR322<br>
(Sutcliffe, Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol 43: 77-90 (1978)).<br>
Thus, the vector design of pxTF-7T3FL allows for the temporally separate expression of each chain<br>
by using two different, rather than two identical, promoters. In this plasmid, light chain is under the control<br>
of the phoA promoter. However, the tacll promoter is used to control the transcription of heavy chain. As is<br>
known in the art, phoA and lac// promoters are induced under substantially different conditions. A<br>
schematic comparison of a single-promoter plasmid paTF130 and pxTF-7T3FL is depicted in Figure 4. The<br>
nucleic acid sequence of the expression cassette of pxTF-7T3FL (SEQ ID NO:4) is provided in Figure 5. and<br>
the polypeptide sequences it encodes (SEQ ID NOS:5 and 6) are provided in Figures 6A (light chain) and 6B<br>
(heavy chain, respectively. The host cells below were co-transformed with pxTF-7T3FL and pJJ247.<br>
33<br><br>
Attorney Docket No: P1941RI<br>
pJJ247 encodes a tacll promoter driving the expression of both DsbA and DsbC, with DsbA first in the<br>
series, and its construction is described in WO02/061090.<br>
b. .Fermentation<br>
For small-scale expression E. coli strain 61D6, with genotype W3110 AjhuA (AtonA) plr3 laclq<br>
lacL8 AompTA(nmpc-fepE) degP41, was used as host cells. Following transformation, selected transformant<br>
picks were inoculated into 5 ml of Luria-Bertani medium supplemented with carbenicillin (50 :g/ml) and<br>
kanamycin (50 :g/ml) grown at 30°C on a culture wheel overnight. A 10-liter fermentation was conducted<br>
using the media as described in WO02/061090 and the basic fermentation conditions were also as described<br>
in WO02/061090, except that the following modifications were made to the fermentation process: 300 mL of<br>
1M NaPO4, pH 7.0 was added at approximately 40 hours to give a concentration of about 30 mM. 100 mL<br>
of a 200-mM solution of IPTG was added at approximately 44 hours to give a concentration of about 2 mM.<br>
The fermentation was harvested 80 hours after inoculation.<br>
B.	Protein Identification<br>
The one-dimensional SDS-PAGE gel electrophoresis was carried out in a 4-12% linear acrylamide<br>
gradient from Novex. Specifically, the system used was the NOVEX® NUPAGE™ System, consisting of<br>
NUPAGE™ Bis-TRIS Pre-Cast Gels (for low- to mid-molecular weight proteins).<br>
C.Chemicals<br>
The precipitation agent ethacridine lactate was 98% pure and purchased from Sigma (St. Louis,<br>
MO, USA). Ethacridine lactate has a molecular weight of 361.4Da. All other chemicals were of analytical<br>
grade.<br>
D.	Precipitation<br>
The antibody- and F(ab')2-containing E. coli materials were homogenized using a microfluidizer<br>
from Watts Fluidair Inc. (model B12-04DJC, Kittery, MN, USA). The cells were passed three times through<br>
the microfluidizer at 4-bar pressure. To avoid heat degradation of the proteins, the material was passed<br>
through an ice-water bath during each pass through the microfluidizer. The total protein concentration'in the<br>
F(ab')2 homogenates was 30 mg/ml. The full-length anti-TF homogenate, which was derived from re-<br>
suspended paste, had a total protein concentration of 18 mg/ml. The anti-TF paste was re-suspended in 25<br>
mM TR1S-HCI buffer, pH 7.5.<br>
The ethacridine lactate precipitation agent was dissolved in water to the desired final concentration<br>
(w/v).<br>
1. pH study:<br>
The precipitation experiments were performed with a constant ethacridine lactate concentration of<br>
0.6% (w/v). A 0.8% ethacridine lactate solution was prepared and mixed with the E. co/i homogenate in a<br>
3:1 ratio, e.g., 3 ml of ethacridine lactate and 1 ml of £ coli homogenate. The pH was adjusted using HCI or<br>
NaOH depending on the pH desired.<br>
34<br><br>
Attorney Docket No: P1941R1<br>
2.	Ethacridine lactate concentration study:<br>
The homogenate was diluted 4-fold with ethacridine lactate stock solutions (1:3 as in the pH study)<br>
and the pH was kept at a set value for each of the target proteins. For anti-CD18, the pH was 8.5 and for<br>
anti-TF pH 7.5. The final ethacridine lactate concentrations in the precipitation systems were 0.15, 0.30,<br>
0.45. 0.60. 0.75. and 0.9% (vv/v). As a reference a set of experiments with 0% ethacridine lactate was<br>
performed.<br>
3.	Conductivity/dilution study:<br>
Various concentrations of NaCI were added to anti-CD18 homogenate to evaluate the effect of<br>
conductivity on protein precipitation. The NaCI concentrations studied were 0, 50,100, 150, 200, and 400<br>
mM. A reference series without ethacridine lactate was also performed to determine if any protein was<br>
precipitated due to the high salt concentration. The pH in this salt spike study was 8.5 and the anti-CD18<br>
homogenate was diluted 4-fold. The ethacridine lactate concentration in the samples was 0.6% and 0% for<br>
the reference experiments.<br>
To change the conductivity of the sample the homogenates were diluted in increasing amounts, the<br>
pH was kept constant, pH 8.5 and 7.5 for anti-CD 18 and anti-TF, respectively. All experiments had a final<br>
ethacridine lactate concentration of 0.6% (w/v). The homogenates were diluted 2, 3,4, 5,6, and 7-fold.<br>
4.	Temperature study:<br>
Some experiments were performed at elevated temperatures. The E. coli homogenate was diluted<br>
4-fold and the final ethacridine lactate concentration was 0.6%. The pH was 8.5 or 7.5 for anti-CD18 and<br>
anti-TF, respectively. The samples were incubated in a thermostated water bath at a desired temperature,<br>
i.e., 50, 60, and 70°C. The samples were incubated for 20-120 minutes at elevated temperatures. One long-<br>
time incubation, 16 hours, was performed at 50°C.<br>
After mixing the precipitation agent and E. coli homogenate together and adjustment of pH, the<br>
samples were incubated under agitating conditions for 30-60 minutes. The precipitation experiments were<br>
performed in glass tubes, at 4-ml scale. All experiments were performed in duplicate and average values<br>
were reported.<br>
E.	E. coli Protein Assay<br>
Ethacridine lactate interacts with mot commonly used protein measurement assays, e.g., Bradford.<br>
BCA. and spectrophotometric absorption measured at 280 nm. Thus, the total protein concentrations were<br>
measured using a generic E. coli protein EL1SA. The samples were diluted in a fish gelatin-containing<br>
buffer (0.15 M NaCI. 0.1 M NaPO4, 0.1% fish gelatin, 0.05% TWEEN 20™, 0.05% PROCL1N™ 300) to<br>
reduce the unspecified binding to the anti-E. coli protein antibodies. The coating antibody was Goat anti-<br>
Whole ECP. The conjugate antibody was an anti-antibody Whole ECP, attached to horseradish peroxidase.<br>
The absorption at 405 nm was monitored using a plate reader from Molecular Devices model SPECTRA<br>
MAX PLUS™ (Sunnyvale, CA, USA).<br>
F.	Protein G Assay<br>
To measure the recovered F(ab')2 and antibody concentrations, a protein G affinity chromatographassay was used. An IMMUNO DETECTION™ protein G column was purchased from PerSeptive<br>
Biosystems (Framingham. MA, USA). The column was equilibrated with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)<br>
and eluted with PBS that had been pH adjusted to 2.2 with HCl. To minimize the interference from<br>
35<br><br>
Attorney Docket No: P1941R1<br>
ethacridine lactate. samples were treated on exclusion spin columns (BIO-SPIN® 6 Tris columns (Bio-Rad<br>
Laboratories, Hercules. CA. USA)) before assay. The spin columns were used as recommended by the<br>
vendor. A tetramethylammonium chloride (TMAC) wash step was introduced (Fahrner el at.,<br>
Biotechnology and Genetic Engineering Reviews. 18: 302-327 (2001)) to the chromatography method to<br>
minimize any interference of residual ethacridine lactate in the sample. The assay was performed using a<br>
HPLC (HP 1090™ liquid chromatograph) from Hewlett Packard (Mountain View, CA, USA). The samples<br>
were diluted with PBS. Standard curves were prepared for each of the proteins using purified protein (from<br>
Genentech, Inc.).<br>
G. DNA Assay<br>
The DNA concentration in the supernatants after precipitation was measured using a Pico Green Kit<br>
from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR, USA). It is a fluorescence assay where the fluorescent reagent (Pico<br>
green) binds to double-stranded DNA. The Pico green reagent is exited at 502 nm and the emission at 523<br>
nm is recorded. The assay was performed using a fluorescence plate reader. SPECTRA MAX GENINI<br>
XS™, from Molecular Devices (Sunnyvale, CA, USA). Ethacridine lactate interacts with the Pico green<br>
assay and thus the precipitation agent was removed from the solution prior to analysis. Ethacridine lactate<br>
was removed from the sample using BIO-SPIN® 6 TRIS columns, described in the protein G affinity<br>
chromatography assay section.<br>
H. SDS-PAGE<br>
Supernatants obtained after ethacridine lactate precipitation were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Non-<br>
reduced 4-12% NUPAGE™ gels from Novex (San Diego, CA, USA) were used to visualize the purification<br>
and recovery of anti-CD 18 and anti-TF. Pre-cast gels ere used and the running buffer was MOPS (pre-made<br>
concentrate purchased from Novex). The gels were stained with a filtered solution of COOMASSIE<br>
BRILLIANT BLUE R250™. The supernatants were volume compensated in regard to respective clarified<br>
E. coli extract. In this way, the intensity of the protein bands in the E. coli extract and samples should be<br>
identical if a 100% yield is obtained in the supernatants after precipitation with ethacridine lactate. Thus, the<br>
gels can be used to indicate accurately the extent of purification obtained from the precipitation.<br>
I. Ethacridine lactate Solubility<br>
Two ethacridine lactate solutions, i.e., 0.6 and 1.2%, were studied. Each solution was divided into<br>
two aliquots and pH adjusted to 6.0 and 9.0. respectively. To obtain a slight buffer capacity in the system,<br>
the ethacridine lactate was dissolved in 10 mM Tris-HCl buffer. Each ethacridine lactate solution was<br>
exposed to increasing amounts of NaCl, i.e., 0, 50. 100, 150, 200, 300, and 600 mM. The samples were<br>
incubated for 3 hours, then centrifuged for 20 minutes at 12000 g in a microfuge (SORVALL MC12V™.<br>
DuPont, Wilmington. DE, USA). The supernatants were assayed for ethacridine lactate by measuring the<br>
absorption at 270 nm. The speotrophotometer used was a HP8453 UV-VIS™ from Hewlett Packard<br>
(Wilmington, DE). now Aligent Technologies (Palo Alto, CA) and known as the AGILENT 8453 UV-<br>
VIS1M spectrophotometer. A standard curve was derived from a solution with known ethacridine lactate<br>
concentration.<br>

J. Turbidity<br>
To measure the stability of supematants as a function of time and temperature, the turbidity was<br>
monitored. The turbidity meter used was from HACH (model 2100N, Ames, Iowa, USA). The samples<br>
were measured at room temperature and without dilution of the sample.<br>
The anti-CD 18 homogenate was treated either with 0.6% ethacridine lactate, 0.2% PEI, or only<br>
water. In all of the three samples the anti-CD 18 homogenate was diluted 4-fold and the pH was 7.2+0.2.<br>
After centrifugation for one hour at 4000 g the supematants were recovered and divided into two aliquots.<br>
One part of each sample was incubated at room temperature (21°C) and the other one at 4°C.<br>
Results and Discussion<br>
Effect of pH<br>
The ethacridine lactate molecule is positively charged over most of the pH interval (Miller, supra;<br>
Neurath and Brunner. supra; Franek, Methods in Enzvmology. ed. Langone, J.J., Van Vunakis, H., 121:<br>
631 -638 (1986)). However, since pH changes affect the charge on polypeptides and there is a correlation<br>
between the p1 of the polypeptide and the pH at which it precipitates when exposed to ethacridine lactate<br>
(Neurath and Brunner. supra), the effect of pH on degree of purification in the method of this invention was<br>
investigated.<br>
Homogenates containing anti-CD18 F(ab')2, anti-TF F(ab')2, and full-length anti-TF, respectively,<br>
were exposed to a 0.6% ethacridine lactate solution adjusted to cover the pH range 4-10. Figs. 8A-8C show<br>
the clarified phases after ethacridine lactate treatment and centrifugation of each of these proteins,<br>
respectively.<br>
In Table 1. anti-TF was studied both as a full-length antibody and as a F(ab')2. E. co/i homogenates<br>
were treated at a 1:3 ratio with a 0.8% (w/v) ethacridine lactate solution, i.e., a final ethacridine lactate<br>
concentration of 0.6% in the sample. The pi I was adjusted with HO and NaOH respectively to obtain<br>
desired pH. The yields and purification factors are calculated in respect to each of the clarified cell<br>
homogenates. The DNA concentration in the recovered supematants is also reported in the table.<br><br><br>
Attorney Docket No: P1941R1<br>
It can be seen that for all three proteins a bell-shaped curve was obtained with respect to extent of<br>
purification and DNA concentration over the pH range of 4 to 10. At the middle pH values, i.e., pH 5-9, an<br>
approximately 5-fold purification was obtained. The yield ofanti-CD18 F(ab')2 and anti-TF antibody full-<br>
length and F(ab')2 decreased with higher pH. and anti-TF antibody fulMength and F(ab')2 had a stronger pH<br>
dependence than anti-CD18 F(ab')2. The yield of anti-CD18 F(ab')2 is decreased from 100 to 85% and of<br>
anti-TF F(ab')2 from 93 to 18% in the pH range 4-10. Without being limited to any one theory, this could<br>
partly be due to the lower p1 of anti-TF compared to anti-CD 18, e.g., p1 7.5 and 8.9, respectively; however,<br>
these are theoretically calculated p1 values.<br>
The full-length anti-TF protein has an even stronger pH dependence than the F(ab')2 version of the<br>
protein. The purity of full-length anti-TF is highest at pH 7.0. At pH above 8 significant yield losses are<br>
observed (Fig. 8C). For the full-length anti-TF a pH of about 7.0 is preferred, i.e., a 7.1-fold purification and<br>
86% yield. One possible explanation for the higher losses of anti-TF compared to anti-CD18, without being<br>
limited to any one theory, is that anti-TF has more negative surface charges than anti-CD 18 when incubated<br>
above its p1. Analogous to this, without being limited to any one theory, the larger full-length anti-TF might<br>
have more negative surface charges than the corresponding F(ab')2 and thus a significantly higher yield loss<br>
is observed when increasing the pH.<br>
However, components other than cell debris and host protein have to be removed from the target<br>
polypeptide. One such component is DNA. The major disadvantage of having high DNA concentration<br>
together with the target polypeptide is that the viscosity of the solution increases. This will have a negative<br>
impact on the further downstream processing. In addition, if an anion-exchange column is used as the first<br>
capture column, the negatively charged DNA will bind to the resin and thus reduce the protein capacity of<br>
the column.<br>
Hence, the DNA concentration in the supernatants after precipitation with ethacridine lactate was<br>
determined. The results show that the DNA concentration in the supernatants after ethacridine lactate<br>
precipitation is significantly reduced compared to the initial DNA concentration obtained in the E. coli<br>
homogenale. However, the DNA concentration in the supernatant increased as the pH thereof decreased,<br>
i.e., 0.1 and 0.2 µg/ml at pH 5.0 and 4.0 respectively. Without being limited to any one theory', this could be<br>
due to the fact that the phosphates on the DNA become less negatively charged at lower pH. At very high<br>
pH, e.g., pH 10.0. the DNA concentration is significantly increased (0.3 (ig/ml) and the protein purity also<br>
was decreased. Without limitation to any one theory, this is partly due to the fact that the pH is above the p1<br>
of the antibody and l'(ab')2: however, it can also partly be due to the fact that ethacridine lactate is less<br>
charged at this pH.<br>
Effect of ethacridine lactate concentration<br>
The E. coli homogenates were mixed with ethacridine lactate solutions in a (1:3) ratio. The<br>
ethacridine lactate concentration in the samples was increased in 0.15% increments from 0 to 0.9% (w/v).<br>
This study was performed at pH 8.5, 7.5. and 6.0 for anti-CD18, anti-TF F(ab')2, and full-length antibody,<br>
respectively.<br>
Table 2 shows the effect of ethacridine lactate concentration on purification and yield.   In Table 2.<br>
anti-TF was studied both as a full-length antibody and as a F(ab')2. E. coli homogenates were treated at a 1:3<br>
38<br><br>
Attorney Docket No: P1941R1<br>
ratio with different concentrations of ethacridine lactate solutions; the final ethacridine lactate concentration<br>
in the sample is reported. The pH of the anti-CD18. anti-TF(F(ab')2), and full-length anti-TF was 8.5 .7.5<br>
and 6.0. respectively. The DNA concentration in the recovered supernatants is also reported in the table.<br>
Table 2<br>
The effect on purity and yield of anti-CD18 and anti-TF when treated with increasing<br>
ethacridine lactate concentration<br><br>
* A value of 1 is the same purification as is obtained in the system not treated with ethacridine lactate.<br>
The purity of the antibodies was shown to be strongly correlated with the concentration of<br>
ethacridine lactate (Figs. 9A-9C and Table 2). At ethacridine lactate concentrations above about 0.6% the<br>
effect of increased ethacridine lactate concentration on increased purification was not dramatic. However, at<br>
lower concentrations of ethacridine lactate, i.e. when ethacridine lactate is deficient, every slight addition of<br>
the precipitation agent resulted in a substantial additional purification of the F(ab')2.<br>
The yield of anti-CDI8 F(ab')2 was not affected by the addition of different concentrations of<br>
ethacridine lactate. The step recovery for both of the F(ab')2 was about 90% for all the experiments.<br>
However, it appears easier to obtain quantitative recovery of the F(ab')2 anti-CD18 than the anti-TF F(ab')2.<br>
Without being limited to any one theory, this could be because there are more negative surface charges on<br>
the anti-TF F(ab')2 compared to the anti-CD18 F(ab')2 at the pH studied. The full-length anti-TF reached its<br>
maximum purification at a lower ethacridine lactate concentration than the corresponding F(ab')2 protein.<br>
0.3% and 0.6%, respectively. Without being limited to any one theory, this is probably due to a lower overall<br>
protein concentration in the anti-TF full-length homogenate, i.e., 18 and 30 mg/ml for the full-length and<br>
F(ab')2 anti-TF, respectively. The full-length anti-TF is also derived from re-suspended paste and the F(ab")2<br>
is taken as broth directly from the fermentor. Hence, soluble culture media components present in the E. co/i<br>
broth will not be present in the re-suspended full-length anti-TF material, which could partly explain the<br>
differences seen, without limitation to any one theory.<br>
The DNA concentration in the supernatants is strongly correlated with the data obtained for the<br>
protein purification. At 0.6% or higher ethacridine lactate addition, no DNA was detected in the<br>
39<br><br>
Attorney Docket No: P1941R1<br>
supernatants. There is also a clear trend of decreasing DNA concentration, i.e., 78 to 0 fig/ml, in the<br>
supernatants when the ethacridine lactate concentration is increased from 0 to 0.6%.<br>
Effect_of Conductivity<br>
As ethacridine lactate precipitates proteins partly due to the charged characteristics of the molecule<br>
(Neurath and Brunner. supra), the conductivity of the sample may have an effect on the purity of the<br>
antibody and F(ab')2 after precipitation. Hence, if the sample has high salt concentration, i.e., high<br>
conductivity, the salts could shield the proteins from the ethacridine lactate and thus reduce the purification<br>
effect.<br>
Anti-CD18 homogenate was subjected to two sets of experiments to separate the effect of the<br>
conductivity from the protein concentration in the sample. To both sets of experiments NaCl was added (0-<br>
400mM). One set of the experiments contained 0.6% ethacridine lactate and in the other set water was used.<br>
The water-containing systems were used as controls, so that if the NaCl would give rise to any precipitation<br>
this could be distinguished from the precipitation derived from the ethacridine lactate. In the systems without<br>
ethacridine lactate, i.e. the water systems, no protein precipitation was observed in the 0-400mM NaCl<br>
concentration range (Fig. 10A). The ethacridine lactate-containing experiments showed a strong increase in<br>
the purification of anti-CDI8 when the conductivity was decreased (Fig. 10B).<br>
Without being limited to any one theory, one reason for the improved purification of anti-CD18 at<br>
lower conductivity could be the low shielding capacity of the charged ethacridine lactate at low salt<br>
concentration. Analogous shielding effects have been seen when PEI is used for protein purification at<br>
increasing salt concentration (Jendrisak, supra). However, an even more important factor is the low<br>
solubility of ethacridine lactate at higher salt concentrations (Miller, supra; Neurath and Brunner, supra;<br>
Franek, supra). At l00mM NaCI precipitation of ethacridine lactate was observed in the extraction system,<br>
and as the salt concentration was increased, more of the ethacridine lactate was precipitated. Hence, less<br>
ethacridine lactate is soluble in the system and available to precipitate proteins and other biomolecules.<br>
When the solubility of ethacridine lactate as a function of NaCI concentration was studied, a pH<br>
dependence was observed (Fig. 11). At pH 6 no significant difference in the solubility between the 0.6 and<br>
1.2% ethacridine lactate solution was observed. Both solutions were soluble at 50mM NaCI but nearly fully<br>
precipitated at l00mM. For the pH 9 solutions, where the ethacridine lactate was less charged, a significant<br>
difference in solubility was seen between the two concentrations of ethacridine lactate. The 0.6% ethacridine<br>
lactate solution precipitated at lower salt concentration than the more concentrated ethacridine lactate<br>
solution (Fig. 11). Chlorides have been shown to precipitate ethacridine lactate especially efficiently<br>
(Franek. supra).<br>
In practice, the conductivity of a precipitation experiment will be determined by the dilution factor.<br>
Hence, a set of experiments was performed where the impact of the dilution factor of the E. coli homogenate<br>
was studied. The overall ethacridine lactate concentration was kept constant, i.e., 0.6% (w/v), but the<br>
conductivity of the sample was decreased with increased dilution. The results are shown in Table 3. In<br>
Table 3, anti-TF was studied both as a full length antibody and as a F(ab')2. The concentration of ethacridine<br>
lactate in each experiment was 0.6% (w/v). The pH of the anti-CDI8, anti-TF(F(ab')2), and full- length anti-<br>
TF was 8.5 ,7.5 and 6.0. respectively. The yields and purification factors are calculated in respect to each of<br>
40<br><br>
Attorney Docket No: P1941R1<br>
the clarified cell homogenates. The DNA concentration in the recovered supernatants is also reported in the<br>
table.<br>
Table 3<br>
The effect on the purity and yield of anti-CD18 and anti-TF upon dilution of the E. co/i homogenates in<br>
different amounts<br><br>
* A value of 1 is the same purification as is obtained in the system not treated with ethacridine lactate<br>
The results showed that the purification of F(ab')2 was enhanced if the conductivity was lowered by<br>
increasing dilution. However, at a conductivity of 3.5mS or lower the effect of conductivity was minor. For<br>
the E. coli homogenate used in this Example a 4-fold dilution had to be performed to obtain conductivity<br>
below 3.5mS. For the full-length anti-TF antibody a slightly lower dilution can be performed than for the<br>
F(ab')2 homogenates. Without limitation to any one theory, this can be due to the fact that the protein<br>
concentration in the full-length homogenate is lower. Furthermore, as the full-length material is derived from<br>
re-suspended paste, some of the media components that might affect the precipitation have been removed<br>
prior to the ethacridine lactate precipitation.<br>
In these experiments the protein concentration was decreased with increased dilution (lowering of<br>
the conductivity). Thus, even if 0.6% ethacridine lactate, which was found to be an excess concentration in<br>
the ethacridine lactate concentration study, was added, maximum removal of host protein and DNA was not<br>
obtained in the less diluted sample. This is due to the increased homogenate concentration, i.e., overall<br>
protein and DNA, in these samples compared to the sample performed in the ethacridine lactate<br>
concentration study. Hence, the overall concentration of protein, DNA, and other components will affect the<br>
ethacridine lactate concentration or alternatively the dilution required. The yield of anti-CD 18 F(ab')2 and<br>
full-length and F(ab')2 anti-TF increased with the decrease in conductivity.<br>
The effect on the DNA removal was also found to be conductivity dependent. At a two-fold    -<br>
dilution, i.e.. 5.0 mS, a high DNA concentration was obtained in the supernatant, 20.7 µg/ml. However, if a<br>
3-fold dilution was performed, i.e.. 4.0 mS. the concentration was decreased to 0.5 µg/ml, and at even higher<br>
dilution no DNA was detected. As pointed out earlier, in this case the total amount of ethacridine lactate to<br>
41<br><br>
Attorney Docket No: P1941R1<br>
protein and DNA increases with the higher dilutions, i.e., at lower conductivity. Thus, the effect seen in this<br>
example is both of lowering conductivity and of increasing amounts of ethacridine lactate.<br>
Effect of temperature<br>
Temperature is a factor that is known to be important when performing precipitation experiments.<br>
Thus, some elevated temperatures were studied in combination with ethacridine lactate. The effect of<br>
incubation time at elevated temperature was also investigated.<br>
Incubation at elevated temperature, i.e., 50-70°C, had a positive effect on the purity of the two<br>
F(ab')2 proteins (Figs. 12A and 12B). The higher the temperature, the more efficient the purification. An<br>
incubation at 70°C significantly improved the purity of the F(ab')2 proteins. Incubating the sample for longer<br>
time, i.e., 40 min compared to 20 min, at 70°C did not improve the purity of the F(ab')2 (Figs. 12A and<br>
12B), but an approximately 10% loss in yield was observed. However, when the sample was incubated<br>
above 70°C, no F(ab')2. was recovered, which is due to temperature precipitation of F(ab')2as well as other<br>
E. coli proteins.<br>
To investigate the effect of the incubation time more closely, an experiment was performed where<br>
the samples were incubated for 16 h and 30 min at 50°C. The results showed that there was no significant<br>
purification improvement for the sample that had been incubated for 16 h compared to 30 min at this<br>
temperature. This indicates that temperature precipitation is a rapid phenomenon, which suggests that a fast<br>
heating to appropriate temperature would be more suitable then a long incubation time.<br>
The full-length anti-TF was also studied at elevated temperatures. A 15-min incubation at 50°C had<br>
a slightly positive effect on the purity of the antibody and no losses in recovered material were observed<br>
compared to a sample incubated at room temperature (Fig. 12C). However, if the temperature was increased<br>
to 60°C, nearly all anti-TF precipitated. The data indicate that the full-length anti-TF has lower stability at<br>
elevated temperature than the F(ab')2 anti-TF protein.<br>
Since an increase in temperature could give rise to modifications of the target polypeptide, the<br>
stability of the particular polypeptide of interest at elevated temperature would need to be evaluated before<br>
implementation.<br>
Stability of feed stream<br>
It is important to recover the cleanest feed streams possible. However, another important<br>
characteristic of the feed stream is its stability over time. Hence, the stability of supernatants after<br>
ethacridine lactate or PEI treatment and a supernatant after plain centrifugation was compared. Each of the<br>
supernatants was incubated at two temperatures, i.e., room temperature (21°C) and 4°C. The stability was<br>
monitored by measuring the turbidity of the respective sample.<br>
In Fig. 13 the change in turbidity over lime is shown for the three different supernatants, i.e.,<br>
ethacridine lactate, PEI. and non-treated clarified supernatant, respectively. It can clearly be seen that the<br>
polyelectrolytes, i.e.. ethacridine lactate and PEI, significantly reduced the turbidity of the supernatant.<br>
Directly after clarification the non-treated clarified supernatant had a turbidity of about 700 NTU, whereas<br>
the PEI-treated sample only had half that turbidity, i.e., 327 NTU, and the ethacridine lactate supernatant had<br>
a turbidity of I NTU. There was not a major difference seen, either over time or with incubation<br>
42<br><br>
Attorney Docket No: P1941R1<br>
temperatures, when monitoring the turbidity of the PEl-treated supernatant. For the supernatant that had only<br>
been centrifuged there was a trend of lower turbidity in the room temperature sample during the first 48<br>
hours. However, the room temperature sample at 72 hours could not be measured due to high turbidity of the<br>
sample. The ethacridine lactate-treated supernatant had very low turbidity that was not significantly<br>
increased if incubated at 4°C. When the sample was incubated at 21°C the turbidity increased significantly.<br>
i.e., from 1 to 100 NTU over 72 hours. However, 100 NTU is still less than the turbidity obtained for the<br>
other two supernatants directly after clarification. Hence, it can be concluded that the supernatant recovered<br>
after ethacndine lactate treatment at pH 7 is a stable feed stream.<br>
Conclusion<br>
Ethacridine lactate can successfully be used as precipitation agent for the primary recovery of<br>
heterologous polypeptides from culture broth or homogenate. When ethacridine lactate is used as<br>
precipitation agent, the ideal target polypeptide preferably has a higher pi than the average host proteins.<br>
Hence, most proteins can be negatively charged and become precipitated by ethacridine lactate at the same<br>
time as the target protein is positively charged and thus recovered in the supernatant.<br>
The preferred concentration of ethacridine lactate for precipitation is highly dependent on the<br>
concentration of host protein and DNA in the broth or homogenate. The higher the protein and DNA<br>
concentration in the broth or homogenate, the higher is the amount of ethacridine lactate required. Hence, the<br>
more negatively charged components available for ethacridine lactate to complex with, and thus precipitate,<br>
the higher is the preferred amount of ethacridine lactate for precipitation. The lower the conductivity of the<br>
solution when performing the precipitation, the more efficient is the purification of the polypeptide. The<br>
precipitation step will give significant polypeptide purification and DNA reduction at the same time as cell<br>
debris is removed.<br>
For efficient host protein and DNA precipitation, the pH is generally between about 4 to 10, and<br>
preferably no more than about pH 9, as the molecule becomes less charged above this pH. Ethacridine<br>
lactate should more preferably be used in the about pH 5-9 range when purifying polypeptide. To improve<br>
the purification, a short incubation at elevated temperature can be performed. However, stability at elevated<br>
temperatures has to be determined for the particular polypeptide of interest to avoid precipitation of the<br>
target polypeptide. Also the quality of the recovered target polypeptide has to be investigated to confirm that<br>
no modifications of the target polypeptide take place.<br>
