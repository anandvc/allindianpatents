FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to novel quinoxaline-piperazine compounds, l-[(6,7-substituted alkoxyquinoxalinyl)aminocarbonyl]-4-(hetero)arylpiperazine derivatives and pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, process for the preparation thereof, and therapeutic methods for the treatment of hyperproliferative disorders, including cancers, by administering quinoxaline-piperazine compounds.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Chemotherapeutics kill tumor cells by interfering with various stages of the cell division process. There are a number of classes of chemotherapeutics including alkylating agents (e.g., cyclophosphamide, carmustine, cisplatin), antimetabolites (e.g., methotrexate, 5-FU, gemcitabine), cytotoxic antibiotics (e.g., doxorubicin, mitomycin) and plant derivatives (e.g., paclitaxel, vincristine, etoposide). Chemotherapy is used as a primary treatment for leukemias, other blood cancers, and inoperable or metastatic solid cancers.<br>
However, current chemotherapeutic agents have a few problems, including limited efficacy, debilitating adverse side effects and development of multidrug resistance.<br>
Novel piperazine compounds may provide potent new therapeutic molecules for the treatment of disorders such as tumors. In association with new development of an anti-tumor agent, U. S. Patent Application Publication No. 2003/0092910 presents the piperazine compounds having formula (A)<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
In U. S. Patent Application Publication No. 2003/0092910, the preparation of l-[(2-alkoxyquinoxalin-3-yl)aminocarbonyl-4-arylpiperazine is presented wherein Ra and Rb are fused to form C3-C4 unsaturated ring. But the compounds of formula A have only hydrogen atom at C-5, C-6, C-7 and C-8 position of quinoxaline ring.<br>
Namely, the compounds listed in U. S. Patent Application Publication No. 2003/0092910 has no other group except hydrogen at C-6 of quinoxaline ring of l-[(2-alkoxyquinoxalin-3-yl)aminocarbonyl-4-arylpiperazine and the compounds with other groups except hydrogen at C-6 of quinoxaline have not been prepared and tested as an antitumor agent.<br>
 <br>
The present invention has studied l-[(2-alkoxyquinoxalin-3-yl)aminocarbonyl-4-arylpiperazine derivatives because of its prominent antitumor activities with very low toxicities and presents novel l-[(6,7-substituted alkoxyquinoxalinyl)aminocarbonyl]-4-(hetero)arylpiperazine derivatives with other functional groups except hydrogen at C-6 of quinoxaline ring of l-[(2-alkoxyquinoxalin-3-yl)aminocarbonyl-4-arylpiperazine derivatives, the process of preparation and strong antitumor activities of these new compounds.<br>
Accordingly, one object of the present invention is to provide the novel compounds, 1 -[(6,7-substituted alkoxyquinoxalinyl)aminocarbonyl]-4-(hetero)arylpiperazine derivatives.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a process for the preparation of the novel compounds, 1 -[(6,7-substituted alkoxyquinoxalinyl)aminocarbonyl]-4-(hetero)arylpiperazine derivatives.<br>
A further object of the present invention is to use 1-[(6,7-substituted alkoxyquinoxalin-yl)aminocarbonyl]-4-(hetero)arylpiperazine derivatives as antitumor agent.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention comprises a novel quinoxalin-piperazine derivative of the general formula (1) or its pharmaceutically acceptable salt, process for the preparation thereof and their use in the treatment of a hyperproliferative disorder, disease or condition in a subject (e.g., a human patient or other animal subject). Methods according to the invention comprise administering to a subject an effective amount of a quinoxalin-piperazine compound according to the invention. Such a treatment can, e.g., prevent, ameliorate, and/or inhibit symptoms of the hyperproliferative condition, and/or can prevent or inhibit cellular proliferation or growth, for instance in a tumor, such as a malignant neoplasm. A treatment strategy of the invention would decrease the tumor burden, at least to a measurable degree, and improve survival of patients suffering from the hyperproliferative condition. Among the diseases, disorders and conditions susceptible to treatment by agents of the invention are neoplasms, and more specifically tumors of various origins (lung, colon, stomach, smooth muscle, esophagus, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, non-small cell lung cancer, etc.).<br>

Biological Tests 1. Growth of cancer cell lines<br>
Cancer cells used in this study to determine the effect of quinazoline compounds were obtained from the following sources: Human OVCAR-3 (ovary), MCF-7 (breast, hormone-dependent), MDA-MB-231 (breast), PC3 (prostate), HepG2 (liver), A549 (lung), Caki-1 (kidney), HT-29 (colon), HCT116 (colon) and PANC-1 (pancreas) from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) (Manassas, VA); MKN-45 (stomach) from DSMZ (Germany); UMRC2 (kidney) from the U. S. National Cancer Institute (Bethesda, MD); Huvec (human umbilical vein endothelial cells), HEK293 (human embryonic kidney) and SK-OV-3 (ovary) from Korean Cell Line Bank (Seoul, Korea). OVCAR-3, MCF-7, PC3, HepG2, A549, HT-29 and MKN-45 were grown in RPMI1640 medium (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum ("FBS"), 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 10 mM HEPES and 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 ug/ml streptomycin ("P/S"). MDA-MB-231, HCT116, UMRC2, Caki-1, PANC-1<br>
and HEK293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium ("DMEM", Invitrogen)<br>
 <br>
supplemented with 10 % FBS, P/S, 10 mM HEPES and 2 mM L-glutamine. HUVEC was maintained in Ml99 Supplemented with basic fibroblast growth factor ("bFGF") 3 mg/ml, Heparn 100 mg/ml and FBS 20 %. All cells were incubated at 37 °C under humidified 5 % CO2.<br>
2. Cell Growth Inhibition Assay<br>
The growth inhibition of the substituted quinoxalin-piperazine compounds against a variety of human tumor cells was evaluated. The relative importance of particular substituent groups on the compounds was also studied. The substituted piperazinee derivative compounds, prepared as described above, were tested, along with DMSO as a control.<br>
The growth inhibition assay of various compounds against human tumor cell lines was performed using the Sulforhodamine B ("SRB") method (Skehan et al., J. National Cancer Institute, 1990, 82, 1107-1112). Briefly, exponentially growing tumor cells were seeded into a 96-well plate at a density of 2 ~ 3 x 103 cells/well and treated with quinazoline compounds the next day. Triplicate wells were used for each treatment. The cells were incubated with the various compounds for 96 hours at 37 °C in a humidified 5 % CO2 atmosphere. After 96-hour incubation, cells were fixed with 10 % trichloroacetic acid ("TCA"), incubated for 1 hour at 4 °C, and washed 3 times with tap water. Subsequently cells were stained with 0.4 % sulforhodamine B in 1 % acetic acid for 30 minutes, washed 4 times with 1 % acetic acid, and air-dried again. After 5 minutes agitation in 10 mM Tris solution, the absorbance of each well was measured at 530 nm using Benchmark Plus Microplate reader (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA).<br>
To translate the ODsso values into the number of live cells in each well, the ODsso values were compared to those on standard ODsso - versus - cell number curves generated for each cell line. The percent survival was calculated using the formula:<br>
% Survival = live cell number [test] /live cell number [control] x 100<br>
The ICso values were calculated by non-linear regression analysis.<br>
Using QSAR and combinatorial chemistry techniques, a large number of compounds, including the compounds shown in Table la-If above, were synthesized. The synthesized compounds were screened against at least three cell lines, PANC-1, MDA-MB-231 and UMRC2, at approximately luM concentration. Compounds showing activity in at least one of these cell lines were selected for further screening. From these compounds, fifty compounds were selected for further evaluation as broad spectrum anti-proliferative agents as shown in the following Table 2a-2b.<br>
