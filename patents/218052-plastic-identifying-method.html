TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to plastic identifying methods.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Plastics have many strong points, such as being lightweight and strong, capable of transparency and non-permeability to water or gases, easily colored and shaped, and due to their high usability, their production volumes and usage volumes are also increasing. However, accompanying this, the volumes of discarded plastics have been increasing, and the increased burden on the environment has become a social problem. To solve these problems and also to use limited resources more effectively, there has been intensive research in recent years on methods of recycling plastics.<br>
Methods of recycling plastics include, for example- material recycling, in which plastics are repelleted and used as raw material for new molded products," thermal recycling, in which plastics are combusted and the thermal energy recovered; and chemical recycling, in which plastics are thermally decomposed for use as reduction agents for blast furnaces, or decomposed down to fats/oils or monomers and reused as raw materials for plastics.<br>
Among these, material recycling can be said to be the most desirable method, as it requires only a small amount of energy for recycling. However, in order to prevent the recycled plastics from having reduced physical properties, it is necessary to prevent the mixture of different plastic types when the plastics are repelleted. Therefore, there is a need for a highly accurate method of identifying plastics.<br>
Conventionally, the main methods used for identifying plastic types are spectroscopic methods such as infrared spectroscopy using near infrared light. However, with these spectroscopic methods, identification is difficult when the plastics to be identified are dark-coloured plastics (for example, the plastics used for such items as the chassis of television receivers and many other household electrical appliances are colored black), because of reasons such as the applied near infrared light being absorbed, and it is therefore difficult to obtain infrared absorption spectra.<br>
Furthermore, when identifying plastic types using obtained infrared<br>
absorption spectra, it is usual to compare and match the obtained infrared<br>
absorption spectra with a group of infrared absorption spectra of various<br>
standard plastics.     The process  of comparing  and matching involves<br>
 searching for the infrared absorption spectrum of a standard plastic that is<br>
 the best fit with the obtained infrared absorption spectrum, and thereby<br>
 identifying the type of plastic.<br>
Very often plastics that are to be recycled contain flame retardants and other additives. However, the standard plastics that have been compared and matched are basically "pure" polymers, and plastics that contain additives have not been included as objects of comparison and matching. Furthermore, the data for the infrared absorption spectra of standard plastics usually have been data obtained by penetrating infrared light through the items to be identified (penetration method).<br>

BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
Referring to the accompanying drawings, the following is an explanation of embodiments of the present invention. It should be noted that in the following embodiments, the same components are referred to by the same reference numerals, and duplicate explanations are sometimes omitted.<br>
Embodiment 1<br>
The plastic identifying method of the present invention includes: (i) a step of obtaining a first infrared absorption spectrum by irradiating infrared fight of a predetermined wave number onto an item to be identified that contains plastic and measuring the intensity of the infrared light that is totally reflected by this item, and;<br>
(ii) a step of identifying the plastic contained in the item to be identified by matching the first infrared absorption spectrum with a group of infrared absorption spectra that have been measured for a group of predetermined materials.<br>
The group of predetermined materials mentioned above is a group of materials containing plastics. Each infrared absorption spectrum in this group of infrared absorption spectra is obtained by irradiating infrared light of a predetermined wave number onto each material included in the group of predetermined materials, and measuring the intensity of the infrared hght that is totally reflected by that material. Matching is then carried out by comparing peaks in the first infrared absorption spectrum with peaks in each infrared absorption spectrum in the group of infrared absorption spectra.<br>
With the plastic identifying method, the plastic contained in an item to be identified can be identified with very good accuracy, even when the item to be identified has been colored, or even when the item to be identified contains a flame retardant.<br>
There is no particular limitation to the method of carrying out the step (i) in the plastic identifying method. For example, a detection unit combining items such as an infrared Hght source, lenses, a prism, and a detection device may be used. An example of such a detection unit is shown in Fig. 1. It should be noted that the above-mentioned infrared Hght of a predetermined wave number (also referred to below as simply "infrared Hght") has a wave number in the range, for example, of 400 cm'1 to 7,000 cm'1 (which puts this Hght mainly into the category of mid-infrared Hght).<br>
Shown in Fig. 1, a detection unit 1 is provided with a Hght source 2, a prism 3, and a detection device 4. Infrared Hght 6 emitted from the Hght source 2 is irradiated onto the item 5 to be identified by the prism 3. At this time, the incident Hght angle θ , which is shown in Fig. 1, should be set so as the infrared Hght 6 to be totally reflected by the surface of the item 5 to be identified. (The incident Hght angle θ should be greater than the critical angle of total reflectance for the infrared Hght 6). For example, the incident Hght angle 0 may be set in the range of 30° to 85°. The intensity of the infrared Hght 6 that is totaHy reflected by the surface of the item 5 to be identified is measured by the detection device 4 after passing through the prism 3. It should be noted that Fig. 1 is a cross-sectional view in which hatching has been omitted in order to make the drawing easier to view.<br>
Additionally, an ATR (attenuated total reflectance) method may be used as the method for causing total reflectance of infrared Hght from the surface of the item to be identified. In this measurement method, the infrared Hght absorption spectrum ("infrared Hght absorption spectrum" is<br>
also referred to hereinafter as simply "spectrum") can be obtained by using an ATR prism, which is a medium with a high refractive index, irradiating infrared light onto the surface of the item to be identified at an angle greater than the critical angle, and measuring the intensity of the totally reflected infrared light.<br>
By using methods of totally reflecting infrared light from the surface of the item to be identified, the type of plastic contained in the item to be identified can be accurately identified even when the item to be identified has been colored.<br>
There is no particular limitation to the method of carrying out the step (ii) in this identifying method. For example, it may involve first setting up a database or the like that records in advance the measured spectra of a predetermined group of materials, then matching them successively with the first spectrum obtained in the step (i). The predetermined group of materials should be a group of materials that contains plastic. Additionally, it is possible to use the same method as that described above in the step (0 for measuring the spectra of predetermined groups of materials.<br>
Matching should be performed by comparing the peaks of the spectra that are to be contrasted. It is possible to compare the peaks, for example, in terms of peak position or peak intensity. This method may involve, for example, verifying whether or not a specific spectral peak of one of the above-mentioned spectra is present in the first spectrum, or by verifying the spectrum (differential spectrum) obtained by taking the difference between the spectra that are to be contrasted if no peak is apparent in the differential spectrum, the two spectra to be contrasted can be considered approximately equivalent). As items to be identified for recycling exhibit various conditions of degradation, it is preferable to have a method that verifies whether or not a specific spectral peak is present in the first spectrum. The result of this matching is that, of the group of predetermined materials, the material exhibiting the spectrum best approximating the first spectrum can be taken as the type of plastic of the item to be identified.<br>
The step (i) in the identifying method of the present invention may include.<br>
(i-a) a step of sampling a test piece from the item to be identified, and (i-b) a step of obtaining the first infrared absorption spectrum by irradiating infrared light of a predetermined wave number onto the test piece, and<br>
measuring the intensity of the infrared light that is totally reflected by the test piece.<br>
In an identifying method such as this, infrared light is not irradiated directly onto the item to be identified, but rather infrared light is irradiated onto a test piece that has been sampled from the item. For this reason, even when the actual item to be identified is very large, the identification process is simple. Furthermore, as the size and shape of the test pieces can be optimized to suit the detection unit regardless of the shape of the actual items to be identified, plastic types contained in the items to be identified can be identified accurately and consistently. This identifying method is also suitable for continuous identifying processes.<br>
Moreover, the step 6) in the identifying method of the present invention may include:<br>
(i-A) a step of sampling a test piece from the item to be identified, (i-B) a step of obtaining a second infrared absorption spectrum by irradiating infrared light of a predetermined wave number onto a first face of the test piece that corresponds to a surface of the item to be identified, and measuring the intensity of the infrared light that is totally reflected by the first area, and<br>
(i-C) a step of obtaining a first infrared absorption spectrum by irradiating infrared light of a predetermined wave number onto a second face of the test piece that was first exposed when the test piece was sampled, and measuring the intensity of the infrared light that is totally reflected by the second face.<br>
In an identifying method such as this, spectral measurements are performed for at least two faces of the test pieces. Furthermore, one of the measured faces is a surface that was first exposed at the time of sampling. For this reason, the type of plastic contained in the item to be identified can be identified accurately and consistently even when the surface of the item to be identified has degraded due to use over a long period and even when grime and similar substances are adhering to the surface of the item to be identified. Additionally, as will be explained below, using this identifying method makes it possible to quantify the extent of dirt on the surface of items to be identified.<br>
[ The identifying method can be implemented, for example, by using<br>
the identifying apparatus .shown in Fig. 2. The identifying apparatus; shown in Fig. 2 is provided with a sampling unit 8 that samples a test piece 7 from the item 12 to be identified, an identification unit 9 that is provided<br>
with a detection unit 1 for identifying the type of plastic contain edinthe test piece 7, and a transport unit 10 that transports the test piece from the sampling unit 8 to the detection unit 1.<br>
The sampling unit 8 may be provided with, for example, a punch press. In this case, it is easy to sample the test piece 1. The identification unit 9 may be provided with, for example, the detection unit shown in Fig. 1. The transport unit 10 may be provided with, for example, a chucking unit 11. When the chucking unit 11 is provided, it is easier to measure the surfaces for two or more surfaces of the test piece 1. Additionally, the matching of the first spectrum with a group of spectra may be performed using the identification unit 9. In this case, the data for the group of spectra may be recorded in advance in the identification unit 9, then after the first spectrum is measured by the detection unit 4, the first spectrum data can be sent to the identification unit-9 and-matched)<br>
In the identifying method of the present invention, the predetermined group of materials may be the group of materials that contains at least one material selected from the group consisting of acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene copolymer (ABS), polypropylene (PP), and polystyrene (PS). These plastics are very often used in the chassis of household electrical appliances and the like.<br>
In the identifying method of the present invention, the predetermined group of materials may be a group of materials containing plastic that contains a flame retardant. In fact, the plastic contained in items to be identified for recycling very often contains flame retardants. When the plastic contained in an item to be identified contains flame retardants, it is sometimes difficult to identify the plastic type merely by matching the first measured spectrum with a group of spectra of standard plastics. For that purpose, with an identifying method such as this, even when the item to be identified contains flame retardants, the type of plastic contained in item to be identified can be identified accurately.<br>
In the identifying method, plastics that contain flame retardants may be an ABS that contains a tetrabromobisphenol A (TBA) series flame retardant. Moreover, the plastics that contain flame retardants may be a PS that contains at least one type of the flame retardant selected from the group consisting of decabrominated flame retardants, TBA series flame retardants, triazine series flame retardants, and ethylenebis series flame retardants.    These plastics are very often used in the chassis of household<br>
electrical appliances and the like.<br>
In the step (ii) in the identifying method of the present invention, when the first infrared absorption spectrum has a peak in the wave number range of 906 cm-1 to 914 cm-1, the wave number range of 1,023 cm-1 to 1,031 cm-1, and the wave number range of 2,234 cm-1 to 2,242 cm-1, and the value obtained by dividing the highest peak intensity in the wave number range of 1,000 cm'1 to 1,008 cm-1 by the highest peak intensity in the wave number range of 1,023 cm-1 to 1,031 cm-1 is not greater than 0.5, then the item to be identified may be identified as an ABS. It should be noted that the reason for allowing some width in the peak wave numbers used for identification is due to consideration for the effects of such factors as measurement error and peak shifts caused by additives, and the like.<br>
Table 1 below shows a compilation of the ABS identifying method. The R value in Table 1 is the value obtained by dividing the highest peak intensity in the wave number range of 1,000 cm'1 to 1,008 cm'1 by the highest peak intensity in the wave number range of 1,023 cm'1 to 1,031 cm'1. It should be noted that the R values in this specification all indicate this value.<br>
Table 1<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
In the step (ii) in the identifying method of the present invention, identification may be performed as shown in Table 2 below. The format of Table 2 is the same as Table 1 above. Specifically, for example, when the first infrared absorption spectrum in the step (ii) has a peak in the wave number range of 1,373 cm-1 to 1,381 cm-1, the wave number range of 2,913 cm-1 to 2,921 cm-1, and the wave number range of 2,946 cm-1 to 2,954 cm-1, then the item to be identified can be identified as a PP. It should be noted that the identifying method for ABS shown in Table 1 is also listed in Table 2.<br>
Table 2<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
The following is an explanation of the value R. As ABS and PS are plastics that contain styrene, they have a peak in the vicinity of the wave number 1,027 cm-. On the other hand, ABS and PS sometimes contain TBA series flame retardants as additives, and when they contain a TBA series flame retardant, a peak appears in the vicinity of the wave number 1,004 cm-1 However, even when they do not contain a TBA series flame retardant, a peak sometimes appears in the vicinity of the wave number 1,004 cm-1due to such factors as the other substances contained in items to be identified and measurement error, and therefore it is not always possible<br>
to be certain whether a plastic contains TBA series flame retardants or not based on only whether there is a peak in the vicinity of the wave number 1,004 cm1. It is for this reason that, in the identifying method of the present invention, the value R is determined, which is the ratio of the highest peak intensity in the wave number range of 1,000 cm'1 to 1,008 cm'1 with the highest peak intensity in the wave number range of 1,023 cm'1 to 1,031 cm1. This method makes it possible to identify whether ABS or PS materials contain TBA series flame retardants reliably.<br>
The following is an explanation with a specific example of how the first spectrum measured for the item to be identified and the group of spectra are matched.<br>
The spectra shown in Figs. 3 and 4 are each a first spectrum for different items to be identified obtained by carrying out the step (i)<br>
The spectrum shown in Fig. 3 has peaks at the wave number 1,027 cm'1 and the wave number 1,004 cm-1(shown as peak 3-1 and peak 3-2 in Fig. 3). Furthermore, the value obtained by dividing the intensity of the highest peak in the wave number range of 1,000 cm-1to 1,008 cm'1 (that is, peak 3-2) by the intensity of the highest peak in the wave number range of 1,023 cm-1 to 1,031 cm-1(that is, peak 3-1)is approximately 0.8. Therefore, the item to be identified, whose measured spectrum is shown in Fig. 3, can be identified as a PS containing a TBA series flame retardant. It should be noted that, in the spectrum shown in Fig. 3, the horizontal axis is the infrared light wave number (cm1) and the vertical axis is light absorbance.<br>
Next, the spectrum shown in Fig. 4 has peaks at the wave number 1,372 cm'1 and the wave number 1,027 cm-1(shown as peak 4-1 and peak 4-2 in Fig. 4). Furthermore, the value obtained by dividing the intensity of the highest peak in the wave number range of 1,000 cm-1to 1,008 cm-1(that is, peak 4-3 in Fig. 4) by the intensity of the highest peak in the wave number range of 1,023 cm'1 to 1,031 cm-1(that is, peak 4-2) is approximately 0.3. Therefore, the item to be identified, whose measured spectrum is shown in Fig. 4, can be identified as a PS not containing a TBA series flame retardant. It should be noted that, in the spectrum shown in Fig. 4, the horizontal axis is the infrared Light wave number (cm-1)and the vertical axis is light absorbance.<br>
Embodiment 2<br>
The following is an explanation of an example of an embodiment of<br>
the plastic identifying method of the present invention in which an item that has a substance adhering to its surface is identified.<br>
After the step (ii), the identifying method of the present invention may further include(ii<br>
(x) a step of obtaining a third infrared absorption spectrum by excluding from the peaks of the first infrared absorption spectrum the peaks of the infrared absorption spectrum of any plastic identified as contained in the item to be identified, and<br>
(y) a step of identifying a substance that is adhering to a surface of the item to be identified by matching the third infrared absorption spectrum with the group of infrared absorption spectra.<br>
It is often the case that an item to be identified for recycling has various substances adhering to its surface, but with an identifying method such as this, it is possible to identify the substances that are adhering to the surface of the item to be identified.<br>
There is no particular limitation to the method of obtaining the third spectrum in the step (x). For example, the differential spectrum may be obtained by subtracting from the first spectrum the spectrum of any plastic identified as included in the items to be identified. Furthermore, the matching of the third spectrum with the group of infrared absorption spectra can be the same matching method as that described in the first embodiment.<br>
Moreover, the step (i) in the identifying method of the present invention may include-'<br>
(i-A) a step of sampling a test piece from the item to be identified, (i-B) a step of obtaining a second infrared absorption spectrum by irradiating infrared light of a predetermined wave number onto a first face of the test piece that corresponds to the surface of the item to be identified, and measuring the intensity of the infrared light that is totally reflected by the first face, and<br>
(i-C) a step of obtaining the first infrared absorption spectrum by irradiating infrared light of a predetermined wave number onto a second face of the test piece that was first exposed when the piece was sampled, and measuring the intensity of the infrared light that is totally reflected by the second face, and after the step (i), it further may include: (X) a step of obtaining a fourth infrared absorption spectrum by excluding the peaks of the first infrared absorption spectrum from the peaks of the second infrared absorption spectrum, and<br>
 (Y) a step of identifying a substance that is adhering to a surface of the item to be identified by matching the fourth infrared absorption spectrum with the group of infrared absorption spectra.<br>
When a substance adheres to the surface of an item to be identified, the second spectrum can be considered to contain the spectrum of the substance, because the substance remains on the first face of the test piece sampled from the item to be identified. On the other hand, it can be assumed that no substance will be present on the second face, which is first exposed during sampling. Therefore, with an identifying method such as this, it is possible to identify the substances that are present on the surface of the item to be identified.<br>
There is no particular limitation to the method for obtaining the fourth spectrum in the step (X). For example, the differential spectrum may be obtained by subtracting the first spectrum from the second spectrum. Furthermore, the matching of the fourth spectrum with the group of infrared absorption spectra that occurs in the step (Y) may be the same matching method as that described in the first embodiment. Likewise, the step (i) also may be the same method as that described in the first embodiment.<br>
In the identifying method of the present invention, the above-mentioned substance may be one material selected from the group consisting of fats/oils, proteins, coatings, celluloses, and inorganic silicates. Such materials often adhere to items to be identified for recycling. It should be noted that acrylic resin-based protective films, for example, or similar materials used to protect the surfaces of items to be identified can be considered as coatings. Additionally, examples of proteins include hand grime and the like, examples of celluloses include lint and the like, and examples of inorganic silicates include dust.<br>
The step (y) (and the step (Y)) in the identifying method of the present invention may be performed as shown in Table 3 below. The format of Table 3 is the same as Table 1 and Table 2 above. Note though, that the value R is not used in identifying the adhering substances. For example, when the third (or fourth) infrared absorption spectrum in the step (y) (or the step (Y)) has a peak in the wave number range of 1,736 cm-1to 1,744 cm-1 the adhering substance can be identified as being at least one material of the group consisting of fats/oils and coatings.<br>

Embodiment 3<br>
The following is an explanation of an example of an embodiment of the plastic identifying method of the present invention in which the extent of dirt on the surface of an item to be identified is quantified.<br>
The step (i)in the identifying method of the present invention may include-<br>
(i-A) a step of sampling a test piece from an item to be identified,<br>
(i-B) a step of obtaining a second infrared absorption spectrum by irradiating<br>
infrared light of a predetermined wave number onto a first face of the test<br>
piece that corresponds to a surface of the item to be identified, and<br>
measuring the intensity of the infrared light that is totally reflected by the<br>
first face, and	'<br>
(iC)step of obtaining the first infrared absorption spectrum by irradiating infrared light of a predetermined wave number onto a second face of the test piece that was first exposed when the piece was sampled, and measuring the intensity of the infrared light that is totally reflected by the second face, and it may further include:<br>
(s) a step of determining an area D1 of the peaks in the first infrared absorption spectrum in the wave number range of 400 cm-1 to 7,000 cm-1, (t) a step of determining an area D2 of the peaks in the second infrared absorption spectrum in the wave number range of 400 cm-1 to 7,000 cm-1, and (u) a step of determining a value D by dividing the area D2 by the area Di (D = D2/D1).<br>
An item to be identified that has been recovered from the marketplace sometimes has dirt adhering to its surface. In cases when dirt is adhering in this way, rehable spectra cannot be obtained simply by<br>
measuring the spectrum of the item to be identified, and sometimes it is difficult to identify the type of plastic contained in the item. Therefore, by sampling a test piece from the item to be identified and measuring the spectra of a first face that corresponds to its surface (which is considered to have dirt adhering) and a second face that was first exposed at the time of sampling (considered not to have dirt adhering), and by quantifying the difference of the peak areas of their respective spectra, or specifically, determining the ratio of their peak areas, it is possible to quantify the extent of dirt adhering to the surface of the item to be identified (a coefficient of surface soiling). If the extent of dirt adhering to the surface of an item to be identified can be quantified, it is possible to identify with greater accuracy the type of plastic it contains. With the obtained coefficient of surface soiling value D, it is possible to perform processes such as removing an item from those targeted for recycling (for example, when D is equal to or less than 0.5).<br>
It should be noted that there are no particular limitations to the methods for performing the steps (s), (t), and (u). For example, mathematical processing may be performed for each obtained spectrum. Additionally, the step (i) may also be the same method as that described in the first embodiment.<br>
Embodiment 4<br>
The following is an explanation of an example of an embodiment of the present invention that involves a method for verifying whether a reliable spectrum has been obtained or not when a spectrum is obtained from an item to be identified.<br>
After the step (ii), the identifying method of the present invention may further include:<br>
(S) a step of establishing a first baseline of the first infrared absorption spectrum by joining with a straight Hne a peak in the first infrared absorption spectrum in the vicinity of the wave number 2,750 cm-1 with a peak in the vicinity of the wave number 3,140 cm-1,<br>
(T) a step of establishing a second baseline of the first infrared absorption spectrum  by joining with a straight line  a peak in  the first infrared absorption spectrum in the vicinity of the wave number 3,663 cm-1 with a peak in the vicinity of the wave number 3,791 cm-1, and (U) a step of taking the peak intensity in the first infrared absorption<br>
spectrum in the vicinity of the wave number 2,920 cm-1 as H1 and the peak intensity in the vicinity of the wave number 3,750 cm-1 as H2, and determining a value H by dividing the H2 by the H1. Note that the H1 is the peak intensity of the first infrared absorption spectrum relative to the first baseline, and that the H2 is the peak intensity of the first infrared absorption spectrum relative to the second baseline.<br>
A peak in the vicinity of the wave number 2,750 cm-1 here means a peak around the wave number 2,750 cm-1, including a range of ± 4 cm-1. Additionally, peak refers to the peak of the highest intensity in cases when there are multiple peaks within this range. The same judgement should also be performed for the peaks measured at other vicinities of wave number in the steps (S), (T), and (U).<br>
When measuring the infrared absorption spectra of an item to be identified, very accurate identification of the type of plastic contained in the item can be achieved if reliable contact is made between the detection unit, which irradiates onto the item to be identified and measures the intensity of the infrared light that is totally reflected by the surface of the item to be identified, and the item to be identified. For this reason, there is a need for a method that verifies whether the detection unit and the item to be identified are reliably in contact.<br>
When contact between the item to be identified and the detection unit is incomplete, there is a layer of air between them. Because water vapor is contained in this layer of air, the condition of the contact between the item to be identified and the detection unit can be verified by analyzing the extent to which the spectrum of water vapor is contained in the spectrum measured for the item to be identified.<br>
Therefore, by dividing H2, the intensity of the peak in the vicinity of the wave number 3,750 cm-1, which corresponds to that of water vapor, by H1, the intensity of the peak in the vicinity of the wave number 2,920 cm-1, which is a reference for resin identification, and thereby obtaining the value H, it is possible to verify the condition of the contact between the item to be identified and the detection unit. For example, if the value H is at least 0.3, the peak intensity of the water vapor can be diagnosed as high, and the contact between the item to be identified and the detection unit can be diagnosed as incomplete. In this case, the position of the item to be identified can be adjusted and measurements retaken. Furthermore, if the value H is lower than 0.3, the process may proceed to identify the type of<br>
plastic contained in the item to be identified.<br>
It should be noted that there is no particular limitation to the method for performing the steps (S), (T), and (U). For example, mathematical processing may be performed for each obtained spectrum.<br>
The present invention may be embodied in other specific forms without departing from the spirit or essential characteristics thereof. The embodiments disclosed in this application are to be considered in all respects as illustrative and not restrictive, the scope of the invention being indicated by the appended claims rather than by the foregoing description. All changes that come within the meaning and range of equivalency of the claims are intended to be embraced therein.<br>
