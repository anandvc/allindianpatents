				<td>The present invention relates to "a process for the preparation of pharmacologically active a-asarone from toxic p-asarone rich Acorus calamus oil via intermediate 2,4,5-trimethoxyphenylpropane of the formula I (a dihydro product of toxic ß-asarone) which is obtained via hydrogenation of commercially available Acorus calamus oil rich in p-asarone containing a and y isomer), undergoes dehydrogenation and/or oxidation in a single step by just varying reaction time, temperature, solvent (anhydrous) and amount of dichlorodicyanobenzoquinone (DDQ) with or without a solid support such as silica gel, alumina and the like towards formation of a-asarone (trans-2,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl-l-propene), a well known pharmacolocally active phenylpropanoid, and trans-2,4,5-trimethoxycinnamaldehyde as a side product. However, above dehydrogenation process when conducted in aqueous solvent provides l-(2,4,5-trimethoxy)phenyl-l-propanone which upon reduction with sodium borohydride into l-(2,4,5-trimethoxy)phenyl-l-hydroxypropane followed by acidic dehydration affords a-asarone exclusively. Moreover, it is worthwhile to mention that l-(2,4,5-trimethoxy)phenyl-l-propanone (isoacoramone) and 2,4,5-trimethoxycinnamaldehyde are found as phenylpropanoids present in traces in some of the aromatic and medicinal plants. Overall, the aim of this invention is to utilize internationally banned, but widely available toxic p-asarone as a simple and economical starting material for the preparation of a potential hypolipidemic and antiplatelet active a-asarone via combination of two simple industrially attractive processes i.e. hydrogenation and dehydrogenation/oxidation in which formation of the unexpected 2,4,5-trimethoxycinnamaldehyde is discovered as a side product during preparation of a-asarone. In the present invention, we have disclosed a simple and economical process that is capable of converting toxic P-asarone into pharmacological active a-asarone in high yield without contamination of its other isomers i.e. ß and/or y-asarone. <br><br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
of p-asarone (3 to 8%) which are allowed for use in flavor, perfumery and pharmaceutical industries (Stahl, E. and Keller, K., Planta Medica 43, 128-140 (1981); Waltraud, G. and Schimmer, O., Mutation Research 121, 191-194 (1983); Mazza, G., J. of Chromatography, 328, 179-206 (1985); Nigam, M. C.; Ateeque, A.; Misra, L. N. and Ahmad, A., Indian Perfumer, 34, 282-285 (1990) and Bonaccorsi, L; Cortroneo, A.; Chowdhury, J. U. and Yusuf, M., Essenze Derv. Agrum., 67(4), 392-402 (1997)).<br>
P-asarone is experimentally proved to be carcinogenic in animals and has also been found to induce tumors in the duodenal region after oral administration. In addition, P-asarone has also shown chromosome damaging effect on human lymphocytes in-vitro after metabolic activation (Taylor, J. M.; Jones, W. L; Hogan, E. C.; Gross, M. A.; David, D. A. and Cook, E. L., Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol., 10, 405 (1967); Keller, K.; Odenthal, K. P. and Leng, P. E., Planta Medica 1, 6-9 (1985); Abel, G., Planta Medica, 53(3), 251-253 (1987) and Riaz, M.; Shadab, Q.; Chaudhary, F. M., Hamdard Medicus, 38(2), 50-62 (1995)). As a result, the calamus oil of Asian origin is internationally banned for any kind of use in flavor, perfumery and pharmaceutical industries. To the best of our knowledge, there is no report in which toxic p-asarone of calamus oil is utilized for its value addition except very recently by our group (Sinha, A.K.; Dogra, R. and Joshi, B.P., Ind. J. Chem., 41B, (2002) (in press); Sinha, A.K.; Joshi, B.P. and Dogra, R, Nat. Prod. Lett., 15(6), 439-444 (2001); Sinha, A.K.; Acharya, R. and Joshi, B.P., J. Nat. Prod. (2002) (in press), Sinha, A.K.; Dogra, R. and Joshi, B.P., Sinha, A.K.; Joshi, B.P., and Dogra, R., JP Patent No. 2001.68716 filed on 12 March (2001); Sinha, A.K.; Joshi, B.P., and Dogra, R., US Patent No. 09-805,832 filed on 14 March (2001);-US Patent No. 09-823123.filed.on 31 March (2001) and Sinha, A.K.; Joshi, B.P., and Dogra, R., PCT/IN 01/00104 filed on 21 May (2001)) wherein ammonium formate/palladium-onfcharcoal or H2/palladium-on-charcoal assisted reduction of crude calamus oil containing high percentage of toxic P-asarone provides 2,4,5-trimethoxyphenylpropane (dihydro asarone) in 97% purity with yield ranging from 81-87% based on asarones content in calamus oil (Example I). Thus, obtained 2,4,5-trimethoxyphenylpropane (also known as l-propyl-2,4,5-trimethoxybenzene) is invented for the first time as five times less toxic than P-asarone and thus, this 2,4,5-trimethoxyphenylpropane enables its application in the products such as mouthwashes, tooth pastes, antiseptic soap products, chewing gum flavors and little in spicy products due to its sweet, ylang, slightly spicy and fruity aroma. In addition, 2,4,5-trimethoxyphenylpropane is<br>
also discovered as a simple and an economical starting material for synthesis of a salicylamide based antipsychotic drug (5,6-dimethoxy-N[(l-ethyl-2-pyrrolidinyl)methyl]-3-propylsalicylamide) (Thomas, H.; Stefan, B.; Tomas, D.P.; Lars, J.; Peter, S.; Hakan, H. and Orgen, S. O., J. Med. Chem., 33, 1155-1163 (1990) and Sinha, A.K., US Patent No. 09-652376 filed on 31 August (2000)). In the present invention, we have extended the scope of further exploitation of 2,4,5-trimethoxyphenylpropane of the formula I as simple and economical starting material towards the formation of pharmacological active oc-asarone of the formula II.<br>
a-asarone (trans-2,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl-l-propene) is well known for its several<br>
pharmacological activities including hypolipideamic and antiplatelet activity but is generally<br>
present in traces with P and y-asarone in various plant species including A. calamus (Patra, A.<br>
and Mitra, A. K., J. Nat. Prod., 44, 668-669 (1981); Dung, N.X.; Moi, L.D.; Nam, V.V.; Cu,<br>
L.D. and Leclercq, P.A., J. of Ess. Oil Res., 7 (1), 111-112 (1995) and Parmar, V. S.; Jain, S.<br>
C.; Bisht, K. S.; Jain, R.; Taneja, P.; Jha, A.; Tyagi, O. D.; Prasad, A. K.; Wengel, J.; Olsen,<br>
C. E.; Boll, P. M, Phytochemistry, 46 (4), 597-673 (1997)). Separation of less abundant<br>
a-asarone is particularly difficult via column chromatography of asarones rich essential oil.<br>
Although, few methods are found in literature for the synthesis of a-asarone including<br>
alkaline isomerisation of y-asarone (2,4,5-trimethoxyallylbenzene), however, a little amount<br>
of toxic p-asarone is always present with a-asarone during alkaline isomerization (Devgan,<br>
O.N. and Bokadia, M.M., Aust. J. Chem., 21, 3001-3003 (1968)). Thus, the reported<br>
synthetic methods are not free from drawbacks such as multisteps approach, expensive<br>
reagents and overall poor yield with contamination of its isomers. hi view of these problems<br>
two factors are pivotal for the synthesis of a-asarone, first to achieve highest selectivity for<br>
the formation of a-isomer without any presence of other isomers and secondly, search for<br>
simple, economical and efficient methods to obtain a-asarone which can be easily achieved<br>
by dehydrogenation of 2,4,5-trimethoxyphenylpropane with the help of dehydrogenating<br>
reagents such as 2,3-dichloro-5,6-dicyano-l,4-benzoquinone (DDQ).	Among<br>
dehydrogenating agents namely, manganese dioxide, p-chloranil, selenium dioxide, Pd/C, selenium and sulphur, DDQ is invented as a single reagent of choice towards formation of a-asarone in a single step by just varying reaction time, temperature, solvent and amount of reagent (DDQ) with or without a solid support such as silica gel, alumina and the like in a mono or biphasic system. In anhydrous solvents namely, alcohol such as methanol, ethanol<br>
and the like; aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons such as hexane, benzene, toluene and the like; ether such as tetrahydrofuran, dioxane and the like, the reaction between 2,4,5-trimethoxyphenylpropane and varying amount of DDQ, preferably ranging from 1.0 to 1.1 moles, furnishes the corresponding dehydrogenated product i.e. trans-asarone (a-asarone) in 41-44% yield and unreacted starting material (i.e. 2,4,5-trimethoxyphenylpropane) along with yellow coloured compound as a side product (4-6%) while 2,4,5-trimethoxyphenylpropane and varying amount of DDQ, preferably ranging from 1.1 to 1.3 moles, furnishes a-asarone ( 48-51%) as well as above yellow coloured compound (9-11%) but without any starting material (Example H). It is interesting to note that the addition of a catalytic amount of solid support such celite, silica gel, alumina, resin and the like to the above mixtures of 2,4,5-trimethoxyphenylpropane and DDQ (1.1 to 1.3 moles) dramatically accelerates the rate of dehydrogenation as well as increases the yield of a-asarone (67-72%) (Example III). On the basis of IR, NMR, Mass spectral data, yellow solid is found to be trans-2,4,5-trimethoxycinnamaldehyde which was further confirmed by comparing the mixed m.p. (139-140 °C) of standard trans-2,4,5-trimethoxycinnamaldehyde prepared by reaction of a-asarone (trans-asarone, procured from Sigma Chemical Ltd.) with DDQ in dioxane. Further, trans-2,4,5-trimethoxycinnamaldehyde has appeared as a rare phenylpropanoid present in Caesulia axillaries and Alpinia flabella (0.000015%) in traces (Kulkarni, M.M.; Sohoni, J.; Rojatkar, S. R. and Nagasampagi, B. A., Ind. J. Chem. Sec. B 25B, 981-982 (1986) and Kikuzaki, H.; Tesaki, S.; Yonemori, S. and Nakatani, N. Phytochemistry, 56(1), 109-114 (2001), thus, preparation of trans-2,4,5-trirnethoxycinnamaldehyde in sufficient quantity opens new vistas for the evaluation of its various applications known for structurally similar cinnamaldehyde derivatives (Tomoshi, K. and Makoto, F., JP Pat. No. 58055414A2; Saotome, K., JP Pat. No. 58201703A2; Watanabe, T., Komeno, T. and Hatanaka, M., JP Pat. No. 6312916A2 and Castelijns, A.M.C.F., Hogeweg, J.M. and vanNispen, S.P.J.M., U.S. Pat. No. 5811588)). After having confirmed the structure of a-asarone and trans-2,4,5-trimethoxycinnamaldehyde, our attention was focused towards exclusive formation of a-asarone in high yield without any starting material and yellow side product (i.e. 2,4,5-trimethoxycinnamaldehyde).<br>
An alternate route for the synthesis of a-asarone is appeared via 1-(2,4,5-trimethoxy)phenyl-l-propanone which can be easily prepared by treating 2,4,5-trimethoxyphenylpropane with varying amount of DDQ (1.0 to 3 moles), preferably ranging<br>
from 1.6 to 2.1 moles, in an aqueous organic solvent selected from methanol, ethanol, tetrahydrofuran, dioxane and the like. Later on, 2,4,5-trimethoxypropiophenone (isoacoramone) is realized as an interesting rare phenylpropanoid occurring in well known medicinal plant Acorus calamus, Piper marginatum as well as in Acorus tararinowii but only in traces (Mazza, G., J. of Chromatography, 328,179-206 (1985); Santos, B.V. de O. and Chaves, M.C. de O., Biochem. Systematics Ecology, 25, 539-541 (1999) and Jinfeng, Hu and Xiaozhang, Feng, Planta Medica, 66, 662-664 (2000). Thus, formation of 2,4,5-trimethoxypropiophenone (isoacoramone) not only appeared as a synthon for the preparation of a-asarone but also facilitate its more rigorous biological evaluation known for structurally similar propiophenone derivatives (Stauffer, S.R.; Coletta, C.J.; Tedesco, R.; Nishiguchi, G.; Carlson, K.; Sun, J.; Katzenellenbogen, B.S. and Katzenellenbogen, J.A., J. Med. Chem., 43, 4934-4947 (2000) and Jaimol, T.; Moreau, P.; Finiels, A.; Ramaswamy, A.V. and Singh, A.P., Applied Catalysis A: General, 214, 1-10 (2001)). To obtain a-asarone, l-(2,4,5-trimethoxy)phenyl-l-propanone is reduced with sodium borohydride into (1-(2,4,5-trimethoxy)phenyl-l-hydroxypropane) followed by acidic dehydration using either p-toluenesulphonic acid or thionyl chloride/pyridine and the like (Example IV-VI).<br>
In conclusion, our invention discloses a simple and economical process for the preparation of pharmacologically active a-asarone along with two important naturally occurring phenylpropanoids namely 2,4,5-trimethoxypropiophenone (isoacaromone) and 2,4,5-trimethoxycinnamaldehyde, starting from relatively cheaper and economical material 2,4,5-trimethoxyphenylpropane obtained via hydrogenation of p-asarone rich Acorus calamus oil as outlined in Scheme-I. Other objectives and advantages of the present invention will be made apparent as the description progresses.<br>

Summary of the invention<br>
The present invention provides a process for the preparation of pharmacologically active natural occurring a-asarone utilizing combination of 2,3-dichloro-5,6-dicyano-l,4-benzoquinone (DDQ) as mild and efficient dehydrogenating agent and 2,4,5-trimethoxyphenylpropane which is, in fact, the hydrogenated product of toxic p-asarone isolated from commercially available calamus oil. It is worthwhile to mention that the above<br>
DDQ assisted dehydrogenation process not only led to -asarone but also provided two more<br>
products which later on were characterized as naturally occurring rarer phenylpropanoids<br>
namely	2,4,5-trimethocyphenylpropanone	(isoacoramone)	and	2,4,5-<br>
trimethoxycinnamaldehyde. Therefore, formation of a-asarone, isoacoramone and 2,4,5-trimethoxycinnamaldehyde in one step process via DDQ assisted dehydrogenation/oxidation of 2,4,5-trimethoxyphenylpropane, is a cheaper and economical method than so far reported methods, as well as, our invention is capable of forming a series of biologically active phenylpropanoids derivatives.<br>

Phenylpropanoids (C6-C3) are mainly produced in plants in response to pathogen attack. This group of secondary metabolites comprises many biologically active compounds like phenylpropanones, cinnamaldehydes, cinnamal alcohols, cinnamic acids and phenylpropenes. Among three isomeric forms of phenylpropene, cis and y-isomeric forms<br>
have proved to be toxic and carcinogenic while trans-isomeric form is reported for its use in flavour, perfumery and pharmaceutical industries but generally trans-isomer is often present in little percentage in plant kingdom (Miller, B.C.; Swanson, A.B.; Phillips, D.H.; Fletcher, T.L.; Liem, A. and Miller, J.A., Cancer Research, 43 (3), 1124-1134 (1983); Kim; S. C.; Liem; A.; Stewart; B. C. and Miller, J. A. Carcinogensis, 20 (7), 1303-1307 (1999) and Lazutka, J.R.; Mierauskiene, S. and Dedonyte, V. Food &amp; Chemical Technology, 39, 485-492 (2001)). In spite of several synthetic methods, the alkaline isomerisation of γ-isomer leads to useful trans-isomer but always with a little percentage of toxic cis-isomer. So, it appeared quite interesting and challenging to develop a simple method for the preparation of trans-isomer exclusively using cis-isomer i.e. conversion of widely and commercially available toxic ß-asarone (cis-isomer) towards synthesis of -asarone (trans-isomer) since rarer -asarone has a great potential and scope in the area of pharmaceutical industries as discussed in details below:<br>
-asarone (trans-2,4,5-trimethoxy-l-propenylbenzene), a constituent of A. calamus and several other plants (Enqiquez, R.G.; Chavez, M.A. ande Jauregui, F., Phytochemistry, 19 (9), 2024-2025 (1980) and Dung, N.X.; Moi, L.D.; Nam, V.V.; Cu, L.D. and Leclercq, P.A., J. of Ess. Oil Res., 7 (1), 111-112 (1995)), is well known for its pharmacological effects such as sedating, neuroleptic, spasmolytic, antiulcerogenic, antiatherogenic (Menon, M.K.; and Dandiya, P.C., J. Pharm. Pharmacol., 9 (3), 170-175 (1967) and Belova, L.F.; Alibekov, S.D.; Baginskaya, A.I.; Sokolov, S.Y. and Pokrovskava, G.V., Farmakol. Toksikol., 48, 17-20 (1985)) including hypolipidemic and antiplatelet activities (Janusz, P.; Bozena, L.; Alina, T.D.; Barbara, L.; Stanislaw, W.; Danuta, S.; Jacek, P.; Roman, K.; Jacek, C.; Malgorzata, S. and Zdzislaw, C., J. Med. Chem., 43, 3671-3676 (2000)). As per hypolipideamic activity is concerned, the available synthetic drugs used for decreasing the levels of cholesterol and triglyceride are Colestipol, Questran, Clofibrate and Neomycin etc which have a certain degree of side effects such as nausea, abdominal and gastrointestinal discomfort, constipation, brittle hair, diarrhea and heartburn. In particular, neomycin has found to have high toxicity. Thus, so far there is no effective and safe drugs which can decrease high cholesterol and triglyceride levels in the patients without side effects. On the other hand, the traditional natural herbs such as Angelica sinesis, Artemisia capillaries, Curcuma longa (Soudamini, K.K.; Unnikrishnan, M.C.; Soni, K.B. and Kuttan, R., Ind. J. Physiol. Pharmacol., 36, 239-243 (1992) and Deters, M.; Siegers, C.; Hansel, W.; Schneider, K.P. and Hennighausen, G.,<br>
Planta Medica, 66, 429-434 (2000)) have been used in clinics for decreasing levels of hyperlipidemia. Similarly, the bark of Guatteria gaumeri, a traditional Maxican medicine, is also used to treat hypercholesterolaemia and cholelithiasis, and its active constituent is reported to be a-asarone (Gomez, C.; Chamorro, G.; Chav'ez, M.A.; Martinez, G.; Salazar, M.; Pages, N., Plant. Med. Phytother., 21, 279-284 (1987)). Cholesterol and triglycerides lowering activity was observed for a-asarone at an oral dose of 80 mg/kg in mice fed with a high cholesterol diet, showing a decrease of 49.6% and 83.7%, respectively. However, the high density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol was found to be increased. (Hernandez, A.; Lopez, M.L.; Chamorro, G. and Mendoza, F.T., Planta Medica, 59 (2), 121-124 (1993); Chamorro, G.; Salazar, M..; Salazar, S. and Mendoza, F.T., Revista-de-Investigacion Clinica, 45 (6), 597-604 (1993) and Garduno, L.; Salazar, M.; Salazar, S.; Morelos, M.E.; Labarrios, F.; Tamariz, J. and Chamorro, G.A., J. of Ethnopharmacology, 55 (2), 161-163, (1997). Toxicity of —asarone is also investigated in rats and mice and no toxic effect is observed (Salazar, M.; Salaz, S.; Ulloa, V.; Mendoza, T.; Pages, N. and Chamorro, G., J. Toxicol. Clin. Exp., 12, 149-154 (1992); Chamorro, G., Salazar, M.; Salazar, S. and Mendoza, T., Rev. Invest. Clin., 45, 592-604 (1993); Sagimoto, N.; Goto, Y.; Akao, N.; Kiucki, F. and Kondo, K., Biol. Pharm. Bull., 18, 605-609 (1995); Lopez, M.L.; Hernandez, A.; Chamorro, G. and Mendoza, F.T., Planta Medica, 59 (2), 115-120 (1993) and Chamorro, G.A.; Salazar, M.; Tamariz, J; Diaz, F. and Labarrios. F., Phytotheraphy Research, 13(4), 308-311 (1999)). In addition, a-asarone is also used as a starting material for the synthesis of various biologically active compounds (Mori-K; Komatsu, M; Kido, M and Nakagawa, K, Tetrahedron Letter, 42 (2), 523-528 (1986)) as well as in the formulation of drugs (Harborne, J.B. and Baxter, H. In: Phytochemical Dictionary: A Handbook of Bioactive Compounds from Plants, Taylor &amp; Francis Ltd., Washington DC, 474 (1993)). Conventionally, some synthetic routes have been developed to prepare a-asarone such as:<br>
(a)	a method utilizing trimethoxybenzene as the starting material (Francisco, D.; Leticia,<br>
C.; Rosa, F.; Joaquin, T.; Fernando, L.; German, C.; Heber, M. Org. Prep. Proced. Int. 23 (2),<br>
133-138(1991)).<br>
(b)	a method in which 2,4,5-trimethoxybenzaldehyde was treated with ethyl magnesium<br>
bromide (Grignard reagent) to afford corresponding alcohol and then dehydration of alcohol<br>
to a-asarone (Wang, Z.; Jiang, L. and Xingxiang, X., Youji Huaxue, 10 (4), 350-352 (1990);<br>
Shirokova, E.A.; Segal, G.M. and Torgov, I.V., Bioorg. Khim., 11 (2), 270-275 (1985) and<br><br>
Janusz, P.; Bozena, L.; Alina, T.D.; Barbara, L.; Stanislaw, W.; Danuta, S.; Jacek, P.; Roman, K.; Jacek, C.; Malgorzata, S. and Zdzislaw, C., J. Med. Chem., 43, 3671-3676 (2000)).<br>
(c)	A method utilizing vanillin as the starting material (Nenokichi, H. and Shibamoto, N.,<br>
Kinki Daigaku Rikogakubu Kenkyu Hokoku, 12, 63-66 (1977)).<br>
(d)	a method comprising photochemical isomerisation of beta-asarone (Saxena, D.B. and<br>
Mukerjee, S.K., Indian J. of Chem., 24B, 683-684 (1985)).<br>
However, all the above reported methods are not practical, because they require several steps, expensive reagents and starting materials with overall poor yield. In the continuing efforts towards synthesis of -asarone with highest selectivity, two step process which involves hydrogenation of the widely and commercially avalaible P-asarone (as discussed above) into 2,4,5-trimethoxyphenylpropane (dihydro asarone) followed by dehydrogenation, appears to be free from the above mentioned drawbacks.<br>
2,4,5-trimethoxyphenylpropane can be obtained by catalytic reduction of p-asarone or the like by hydrogenation process in paar reactor. However, hydrogenation in paar reactor requires explosive hydrogen gas cylinder and also, monitoring of the progress of reaction by TLC is not possible during the hydrogenation. Thus, we have recently reviewed the effectiveness of ammonium formate or formic acid/triethylamine as a catalytic hydrogen transfer agent for the first time for the reduction of plant derived P-asarone or p-asarone rich calamus oil towards formation of 2,4,5-trimethoxtphenylpropane (Sinha, A.K., US Patent No. 09-652376 filed on 31 August (2000)) in good yield details of which is given in example (Example I). The resulting 2,4,5-trimethoxyphenylpropane serve as a simple and economical starting material for generation of double bond in trans form (i.e. a-asarone) using dehydrogenating agents such as DDQ.<br>
Introduction of double bond in a molecule is referred to as a dehydrogenation reaction, which can proceed, by the abstraction of either hydride ion (an ionic mechanism) or hydrogen atom or an electron (free radical mechanism). There are several known dehydrogenating reagents namely MnO2, DDQ, DCQ, Hg(OAc)2, SeO2,Pd/C, Se and S in which DDQ (2,3-dichloro-5,6-dicyano-l,4-benzoquinone) is found effective and facile dehydrogenating reagent for the conversion of 2,4,5-trimethoxyphenylpropane derivatives into trans-asarone. DDQ is widely used as a powerful dehydrogenating agent (Sondengam, B.L. and Kimbu, S.F., Tetrahedron Letters, 1, 69-70 (1977) and Guy, A.; Lemaire, M. and Guette, J.P., Chem. Commun., 8 (1980)) which acts as one electron oxidant (Becker, H. D., J. Org Chem. 30, 982<br><br>
(1965). DDQ was first introduced for the dehydrogenation of tetralin and bibenzyl into naphthalene and stilbene respectively (Braude, E.A. and Waugh, T.D., J. Org. Chem., 30, 3240 (1965)). This high potential quinone has also found wide application (Walker, D. and Hiebert, J.D., Chem. Rev., 67, 153 (1967)), particularly in the field of steroids, and its scope has been extended for the dehydrogenation of ketones, alcohols and lactones etc. A number of allylic and benzylic alcohols react rapidly with DDQ at room temperature (Findlay, J.W.A. and Turner, A.B., J. Chem. Soc. (C), 23 (1971)), which undergo either coupling reactions or dehydrogenation, depending upon their structure. Rapid reaction with DDQ is also often observed in compounds containing activated tertiary hydrogen atoms (Brown, W. and Turner, A.B., J. Chem. Soc. (C), 2057 (1971)). In addition, the DDQ-mediated reactions allow to monitor the progress of the reaction as the green-coloured charge transfer (CT)-complex which is formed initially, starts changing into pink or brown colour (as the 2,3-dichloro-5,6-dicyano-l,4-hydrobenzoquinone crystallized out) and thus, indicates the formation of products. At the end of the reaction, the precipitated hydrobenzoquinone (DDQH2) can be easily separated by filteration which allows to obtain 2,3-dichloro-5,6-dicyano-l,4-hydrobenzoquinone (DDQH2) in 91 to 94 % yield. The amount of precipitated hydroquinone (DDQH2) is a convenient measure of the extent of hydrogen transfer. DDQH2 so obtained can be conveniently converted back to DDQ in good yield by standard methods (Walker, D. and Waugh, T.D., J. Org. Chem., 30, 3240 (1965)). It is worthwhile to mention here that in view of all dehydrogenating reagents (such as chloranil, selenium dioxide, sulphur and selenium), DDQ is found to be effective dehydrogenating reagent towards formation of the carbon-carbon double bond, exclusively in trans form which has also been found in literature during conversion of 4,4'-dimethoxybibenzyl into trans-4,4'-dimethoxystilbene (Lemaira, M.; Guy, A. and Imbert, D., Chem. Commun., 741 (1986)) and Ireland, R.E. and Brown, G., Org. Synthesis, Coll. Vol.V, 428-431).<br>
Interestingly, the interaction between DDQ and 2,4,5-trimethoxyphenylpropane largely depends upon time, temperature solvent and amount of reagent (DDQ). In polar anhydrous solvents namely alcohols such as methanol, ethanol, propanol and the like; ether such as tetrahydrofuran, dioxane and the like; chlorinated solvents such as dichloromethane, chloroform and the like, the reaction between 2,4,5-trimethoxyphenylpropane and varying amount of DDQ, preferably ranging from 1.0 to 1.1 moles, furnishes the corresponding dehydrogenated product i.e. -asarone and unreacted starting material alongwith yellow coloured polar compound as a side product while 2,4,5-trimethoxyphenylpropane and varying<br><br>
amount of DDQ, preferably ranging from 1.1 to 1.3 moles in the same solvent, furnishes a-asarone as well as above yellow coloured compound but without any starting material (Example II). Addition of a catalytic amount of a solid support such as celite, silica gel, alumina, resin and the like dramatically accelerates the rate of dehydrogenation and increases the yield of a-asarone (Example III) as the concept of utilizing reagents adsorbed on inert supports for organic synthesis has also been recently employed by several chemists (Posner, G.H. and Rogers, D.Z., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 99, 8208 (1997); Jr. Filippo, J.S. and Chern, C.I., J. Org. Chem. 42, 2182 (1979)). Formation of side products are not surprising with oxidants like DDQ and many others such as PCC, MnO2, KMnO4, Cr(VI) etc. (Muzart, J. Tetrahedron Letters 28 (40) 4665-4668 (1987)). Initially, the side product (i.e. yellow band) was left several times inside the column (during column chromatography) considering it as unreacted DDQ since DDQ is itself a yellow coloured reagent, however, unsatisfactory yield of trans-asarone, induced us to separate each band and subsequently, to characterize them in details. Finally, the melting point of yellow solid (139-140°C) ruled out the possibilities of DDQ (209-214°C) and thereafter, we successfully characterized it as 2,4,5-trimethoxycinnamaldehyde on the basis of spectral data. The yellow solid showed IR absorption band at 1648 (conjugated C=O) cm"1 and also gave a positive 2,4-DNP test, thus, confirming the presence of carbonyl group. The aldehydic nature of the carbonyl function was indicated by the Tollen's test. 1H NMR of yellow solid showed the 14 number of protons (Example II) which is less by two number of protons in comparison to p-asarone (Patra, A. and Mitra, A.K., Phytochemistry, 44, 668-669, (1981)) except for a doublet at 6 9.65 (IH, d, J=7.8 Hz) which could be assigned to an aldehyde proton coupled with an olefmic proton appearing as a doublet at 8 6.64 (IH, dd, J=15.8 Hz, J=7.8 Hz). This second proton formed a typical large coupling constant with the other olefmic proton 87.81 (IH, d, J=15.8 Hz) and also a kind of the large value of J is indicative of trans-stereochemistry. Further, the position of two aromatic singlet protons and three singlet for nine protons from trimethoxy groups are more or less at same 8 value as starting material, however, appearance of three protons at 8 9.65 (IH, d), 7.81 (IH, d) and 6.64 (IH, dd,) finally supported the possibility of unsaturated aldehyde group (-CH=CH-CHO) attached to trimethoxy substituted phenyl ring. Similarly, the 13CNMR of the yellow solid (appeared at 8 194.1, 154.1, 153.2, 147.6, 143.3, 126.4, 114.5, 110.5, 96.5, 56.4, 56.2, 56.0)) clearly indicated the presence of 12 carbons which is similar to the 12 carbons of p-asarone except the position of side propyl group which<br><br>
appeared at 8 194.1 (C-3'), 154.1 (C-l') and 126.4 (C-2') is possible due to (-CH=CH-CHO) group. The El mass spectrum of yellow solid showed a clear [M]+ peak at m/z 222. This together with above 'H, 13C and IR data, the yellow solid was finally confirmed to be 2,4,5-trimethoxycinnamaldehyde as trans isomer which is later on discovered as naturally occurring rarer phenylpropanoid (Kulkarni, M.M.; Sohoni, J.; Rojatkar, S. R. and Nagasampagi, B. A., Indian J Chem, 25B, 981 (1986)). It is also worthwhile to mention that the formation of trans-2,4,5-trimethoxycinnamaldehyde in a single step from phenylalkane i.e. 2,4,5-trimethoxypropanre opens new route for the synthesis of cinnamaldehyde derivatives and we have recently extended this finding towards development of a series of substituted cinnamaldehyde derivatives exclusively (Sinha, A.K., Joshi, B.P. and Dogra, R. US Patent No. 09-805832 filed on 14 March, 2001 and Sinha, A.K., Joshi, B.P. and Dogra, R. PCT Patent No. IN 01/00104 filed on 21 May, 2001), which is, in fact, a mild and simpler, than hitherto reported synthetic methods (U.S. Patent, 2,529,186, Nov. 7, (1950); Friedrich and Hartmann, Chem. Ber., 94, 838 (1961); Ger. Pat. 1,114,798, Oct. 12, (1961); U.S. Pat. 3,028,419, April 3, (1962); Deuchert, S.K., Hertenstein, U. and Hunig, S., Synthesis, 777 (1973); El-Feraly, F.S. and Hoffstetter, M.D., J. Nat. Prod. 43, 407 (1980); Rajasekhar, D. and Subbaraju, G.V., Indian. J. Chem., 38, 837-838 (1999)). To the best of our knowledge, such two step hydrogenation of widely available allyl/ and/or propenyl phenyl into phenylpropane and then, dehydrogenation of phenylpropane into trans-phenylpropene derivative -asarone), has not been reported earlier, although alkaline isomerisation of allylphenyl always is well documented to provide trans-isomer but always with varying amount of toxic cis-isomer (ß-asarone). Although above method provides a-asarone in 72% yield (Example II) but our main objective was still to increase the percentage of a-asarone and to subside or reduce the yield of abnormal formation of 2,4,5-trimethoxycinnamaldehyde during dehydrogenation/oxidation of 2,4,5-trimethoxyphenylpropane.<br>
In order to further increase the yield of a-asarone, an alternative route appears to prepare intermediate l-(2,4,5-trimethoxy)phenyl-l-propanone (isoacroramone) by treating 2,4,5-trimethoxyphenylpropane with DDQ in aqueous organic solvent which upon treatment with sodium borohydride into l-(2,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl-l-hydroxypropane followed by acidic dehydration towards formation of a-asarone. The structure of 1-(2,4,5-trimethoxy)phenyl-l-propanone, a crystalline solid (mp 109-110 °C), was confirmed on the<br><br>
basis of spectral data (Example IV) which is later on discovered as a naturally occurring rarer phenylpropanoid, isolated from Acorus tatarinowii as a light yellowish viscous gum, however, our method afforded isoacoramone as a crystalline solid with the similar spectral data as natural isoacoramone (Jinfeng, Hu and Xiaozhang, Feng, Planta Medica, 66, 662-664 (2000)). It is also worthwhile to mention that the formation of l-(2,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl)-l-propanone in a single step from phenylalkane i.e. 2,4,5-trimethoxypropane opens new route for the synthesis of phenylpropanone derivatives which is, in fact, a mild, simple and free from drawbacks generally exist with reported synthetic methods and some of reported methods are:<br>
(a)	Friedel Craft reaction of aryl or substituted aryl group with AlCls and acyl chloride<br>
into  aryl  ketone,  however,   methoxy  substituted  aryl  may  lead  to   some  degree  of<br>
demethoxylation with AlCla  during Friedel Craft reaction (Horie,  T., Tominaga,  H.,<br>

(b)	preparation by the acylation of substituted benzene derivatives using acid catalyst<br>

It is also worthwhile to mention that l-(2,4,5-trimethoxy)phenyl-l-propanone (also known as 2,4,5-trimethoxypropiophenone) has been isolated, so far, from well known two medicinal plants (Acorus tatarinowii and Piper marginatum), but, only in trace amounts. Thus, preparation of 2,4,5-trimethoxypropiophenone (isoacoramone) in sufficient quantity has not only allowed to facilitate its more rigorous biological evaluation known for structurally similar propiophenone derivatives (Kuchar, M.; Brunova, B.; Rejholec, V.; Roubal, Z. and Nemecek, O., Collection Czechoslov.

The eluate was evaporated to give 5.87 g (97%) of a clear sweet and pleasant liquid; Rf 0.69 on silica gel plate (hexane: toluene: ethylacetate = 1:1:0.1) which solidified below 0° C; *H NMR (DMSO-d6) 8 6.72 (1H, s, H-6), 6.62 (1H, s, H-3), 3.76 to 3.68 (9H, s, 3-OCH3), 2.5 (2H, t, C-l1), 1.6 (2H, m, C-2') and 0.9 (3H, t, C-3'); 13C NMR (CDC13) δ 151.4 (C-2), 147.4 (C-4), 142.7 (C-5), 122.7 (C-l), 114.3 (C-6), 98.0 (C-3) and 56.5, 56.2 &amp; 56.0 (3x OCH3), 31.6 (C-l'), 23.3 (C-2') and 13.79 (C-3'); EMS m/z 210 (M+, 39), 181(M+- C2H5, 100), 167 (M+- C3H7, 5), 151 (M+- OCH3+ CO, 29), 136 (M+-C3H7 + OCH3, 10). On the basis of *H NMR, 13C NMR and Mass spectral data, the above liquid was identified as 2,4,5-trimethoxyphenylpropane in 99 % purity (by GC). (b) Hydrogenation of crude Acorns calamus oil into dihydro asarone: In this method 42.00 g of crude calamus oil (rich in P and/or cc,y -asarone) in 300 ml methanol was hydrogenated in the paar reactor with 10 % Pd/C (4.80 g) at 10-40 psi at room temperature till the disappearance of starting material. The catalyst was filtered and the solvent was removed under reduced pressure, which afforded 39.9 g (95 w/w) of reduced oil. Column purification of reduced oil on silica gel column using above eluent system (hexane-ethyl acetate mixture) gave 2,4,5-trimethoxyphenylpropane (35.76 g) as a liquid in 85 % yield (w/w); Rf 0.69 (hexane: toluene: ethylacetate = 1:1:0.1); 1H NMR (CDC13) of liquid appeared at 8 6.81 (1H, s, H-6), 6.32 (1H, s, H-3), 3.84 to 3.78 (9H, s, 3-OCH3), 2.4 (2H, t, C-l'), 1.6 (2H, m, C-2'), 0.9 (3H, t, C-3').
