SPECIFICATION<br>
TITLE<br>
Functionalized photoreactive compounds<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention concerns functionalized photoreactive compounds that are particularly useful in materials for the alignment of liquid crystals.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Liquid crystal devices are more and more used in many different applications. Examples are liquid crystal displays (LCD) and optical films, in particular polarizing films and retardation films, as well as security devices for preventing forgery, counterfeiting and copying.<br>
The successful functioning and performance of a liquid crystal device relies on the ability of the liquid crystal molecules within that device to adopt and maintain an alignment Imposed upon them. Alignment of the liquid crystal molecules is achieved by use of an alignment layer which defines a direction of orientation for the liquid crystal molecules with the result that the longitudinal axes of the molecules become aligned with the direction of orientation defined by the alignment layer. In addition to this directional alignment, for some applications the alignment layer should also be able to impart to the liquid crystal molecules an angle of tilt so that the molecules align themselves at an angle out of the surface of the alignment layer.<br><br>
A well known method for preparing alignment layers is a rubbing treatment wherein a high molecular resin film such as polyimide is rubbed in a single direction with a cloth. The liquid crystal molecules adjacent to the rubbed surface are aligned in the rubbing direction. However, alignment films fumed by rubbing have some disadvantages lil<e dust generation and scratches which occur during the rubbing process. in addition methods are not adequate for production of structured layers i.e having small areas kith different alignment directions.></e>
These problems can be solved using liquid-crystal alignment control processes other than rubbing such as oblique deposition, photolithographic, Langmuir Blooded film, ion irradiation, high velocity fluid jet and other processes. However, most of these processes are not practical for processing large-area substrates.<br>
Other methods developed for the alignment of liquid crystals are alignment layers made by photo-orientation methods (usually using linearly polarized light), and especially well suited are linearly photo-polymerized (LPP) alignment layers, also known as photo-oriented polymer networks (PPN). Such methods are for instance disclosed in US-5,389,698, US-5,838,407. US-5,602,661, US-6,160,597, US-6,369,869, US-6,717,644, US-6,215,539, US-6.300,991, and US-6,608,661.<br>
These methods allow the generation of homogeneous alignment of liquid crystals. In the LPP process, which Is a non-contact technique, alignment films similar to those obtained by rubbing can be obtained with high reproducibility by irradiating a photosensitive film on a large substrate area with polarized light. In addition, it is possible to vary the direction of orientation and the azimuthally and polar tilt angle within the photoreactive layer by controlling the direction of the irradiation of the linearly polarized light. By selectively irradiating specific regions of the photoreactive material, it is possible to align very specific regions of the layer and thus to provide alignment areas having different orientation which gives rise to structured alignment layer as described for example in Jon. J. Appl. Phys., 31 (1992), 2155-64 (Schist et al.).<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
For an efficient application process, photoalignment materials advantageously should have a high photosensitivity and a broad processing window. Especially interesting materials would develop similar alignment properties for a relatively large range of irradiation energy (i.e. a broad processing window with respect to the irradiation method) and indication frequencies (i.e. usable with different radiation sources).<br>
It is thus an object of the present invention to provide such photoalignment materials.<br>
The inventors have found that by the adjunction of an electron withdrawing group to specific molecular systems bearing an unsaturation directly attached to two unsaturated ring systems, exceptionally high photosensitivities could be achieved.<br>
in addition to the good photosensitivity, also the alignment performance of these materials was found to be excellent.<br>
As an illustration, the photoreactivity versus exposure energy of a specific compound according to the invention (the compound described under Example A1 below) is given in Figure 1. It can be seen that already with an exposure energy of 20 my/cmâ€™ a very high photoreaction yield of 20 % can be reached. Additionally Indicated is the contrast of a liquid crystalline polymer layer oriented by the correspondingly exposed compound. The contrast is measured between polarizers and already with very low exposure energies reaches values of more than 2000 and thus illustrates the good alignment quality.<br>
It has been found that the substitution pattern has a marked effect on the alignment properties of the material and selected substituents have been identified that are able to provide excellent alignment properties<br><br>
Furthermore, the high photoreaction yield also supports the formation of a good mechanical robustness in materials comprising functionalized photoreactive compounds according to the invention.<br>
Moreover, the inventors were able to synthesize materials having various absorption properties which offer the possibility to better fit the absorption characteristics of these materials to the emission spectrum of the applied polarized light.<br>
Also, many of the materials according to the present invention were found to have excellent alignment capability for cholesteric liquid crystals.<br>
Thus the present invention relates in a first aspect to compounds according to the general formula (I)<br><br>

The term "alkyl", unless the context requires otherwise, includes straight-chain and branched alkyl, as well as saturated and unsaturated groups.<br>
The Tenn. "lower alkyl", as used in tiie context of the present invention, taken on its own or in a combination such us "lower alkoxy", etc., preferably denotes straight-chain and branched saturated hydrocarbon groups having from 1 to 6, preferably from 1 to 3, carbon atoms. Methyl, ethyl, propyl and isopropyl groups are especially preferred. In case of "lower alkoxy", methoxy, ethoxy, propoxy and isopropoxy groups are especially preferred.<br>
The term "aliphatic", unless the context requires otherwise, includes straight-chain and branched alkyl, as well as saturated and unsaturated groups. Possible substituents include alkyl, aryl (thus giving an araliphatic group) and cycioalkyi, as well as amino, cyano, epoxy, halogen, hydroxy, nitro, oxo etc. Possible heteroatoms which may replace carbon atoms include nitrogen, oxygen and sulphur. In the case of nitrogen further substitution is possible with groups such as alkyl, aryl and cycioalkyi.<br>
The term "alicyclic", as used in the context of the present Invention, preferably denotes optionally substituted non-aromatic carbocyclic or heterocyclic ring systems, with 3 to 30 carbon atoms, e.g. cyclopropane, cyclobutane, cyclopentane, cyclopentene, cyclohexane, cyclohexene, cyclohexadiene, decline, tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, pyrrolidine, piperidine or a steroidal skeleton such as cholesterol.<br>
The term "aromatic", as used in the context of the present invention, preferably denotes optionally substituted carbocyclic and heterocyclic aromatic groups, incorporating five, six, ten or 14 ring atoms, e.g. furan, benzene, pyridine, pyrimidine, naphthalene, phenanthrene, biphenylene or tetraline units.<br><br>
The term) "phenylene", as used in the context of the present invention, preferably denotes a 1,2-, 1,3- or 1,4-phenylene group, which is optionally substituted. It is preferred that the phenylene group is either a 1.3- or a 1,4-phenylene group. 1,4-phenylene groups are especially preferred.<br>
The term "halogen" denotes a chloro, fluoro, bromo or iodo substituent, preferably a chloro or fluoro substituent.<br>
The term "polar group", as used in the context of the present Invention primarily denotes a group like a nitro, cyano, or a carboxy group.<br>
The term "heteroatom", as used in the context of the present invention primarily denotes oxygen, sulphur and nitrogen, preferably oxygen and nitrogen, in the latter case preferably in the form of -NH-.<br>
The tenn "optionally substituted" as used in the context of the present invention primarily means substituted by lower alkyl, lower alkoxy, hydroxy, halogen or by a polar group as defined above.<br>
With respect to straight or branched alkyl, alkylene, alkoxy, alkoxycarbonyl, alkylcarbonyl, alkylcarbonyloxy groups it is repeatedly pointed out that some or several of the -CH2- groups may be replaced e.g. by heteroatoms, but also by other groups. In such cases it is generally preferred that such replacement groups are not directly linked to each other. It is alternatively preferred that heteroatoms, and in particular oxygen atoms are not directly linked to each other.<br>
The term "polymerizable group" as used in the context of the present invention refers to a functional group that can be subjected to polymerization (optionally with other comonomers) to yield an oligomer, dendrimer or polymer according to the present invention. For a person skilled in the art it will be obvious which functional groups are intended for any specific polymer. Thus for example in case of "imide monomer** as the indicated polymer backbone group it is obvious to a person skilled in the art that the actual monomer units for polymerization to yield a polyimid are e.g. diamines and<br><br>
dianhydrides. Similarly regarding "urethane monomer" the actual monomer units are diols and diisocyanates.<br>
The compounds according to the present invention in form of prefinished monomers may be readily prepared using methods that are weil Icnown to the person slâ€™iiled in the art. Suitable methods can for instance be found in Houben-Weyl, Methoden der Organischen Chemie. Thieme-Verlag, Stuttgart.<br>
Subsequently these prefinished monomers are typically subjected to direct polymerisation to obtain an oligomer, dendnmer or polymer. Thus, the compounds of the present invention may also be part of an oligomer, a dendrimer or a polymer, which may be a homopolymer or a copolymer.<br>
In a specific embodiment the compounds of formula (I) may be formulated with any other monomers, functional moieties and additives.<br>
For the direct polymerisation, the monomers and (optionally) the comonomers are firstly prepared separately from the Individual components. Subsequently the formation of the polymers is effected in a manner known per se for any given polymer for example under the influence of UV radiation or heat or by the action of radical or ionic catalysts. Potassium peroxodisulfate, dibenzoyi peroxide, azobisisobutyronitrlle or dl-fe/t-butyl peroxide are examples of radical initiators. Ionic catalysts are alkali-organic compounds such as phenyllithium or naphthylsodium or Lewis acids such as BF3, AICI3. SnCl3 or TiCU. The monomers can be polymerised in solution, suspension, emulsion or substance.<br>
If copolymerized with other comonomers the obtained copolymers are consisting of a monomer unit derivating from formula (I) as defined in any of the proceeding meanings and any other known monomer unit that is commercially available or not.<br>
Upon polymerization it may further be advantageous to terminate the growing polymer chain after a suitable chain length is reached by capping the polymerizable group present at the chain end by using specific reagents well known in the art.<br><br>
Suitable polymers include polyacrylates, polymethacrylates, polyacrylamides, polymethacrylamides, polyvinylether and polyvinylester, polyallylether and ester, polystyrenes, polysiloxanes, polyimides, polyamic acids and their esters, polyamidimides, polymaleic acids, polyfumaric acids polyurethanes and derivatives thereof.<br>
These polymers may all be prepared according to well known methods in the art. Thus for example the poly(meth)acrylates described herein may be prepared in line with methods such as described in Polymer Synthesis Characterization: A Laboratory IWanual (Stanley R. Sandler, Wolf Karo, JoAnne Bonesteel, Eli M. Pearce) and Principles of Polymerization (George Odian).<br>
Thus in the case when the monomer unit is bearing an acrylic or methacrylic end, the comonomer unit can be represented by compounds listed below. Most of them are commercially available from chemical suppliers such as Aldrich, ABCR, ACROS, Fluka.<br>

The polyamic acids, polyamic acid esters and polyimides according to the present invention may be prepared in line with known methods, such as those described in Plast. Eng. 36 (1996), (Polyimides, fundamentals and applications). Marcel Dekker Inc. For example, the polycondensation reaction for the preparation of the polyamic acids is carried out in solution in a polar aprotic organic solvent, such as y-butyrolactone, A/,A/-dimethylacetamide, A/-methylpyrrolidone or W,A/-dimethylformamide. In most cases equimolar amounts of the dianhydride and the diamine are used, that is to say one amino group per anhydride group. If it is desired to stabilise the molecular weight of the polymer, it is possible for that purpose to add an excess or a less-than--stoichiometric amount of one of the two components or to add a monofunctional compound in the form of a dicarboxylic acid monoanhydride or in the fomn of a monoamine. Examples of such monofunctional compounds are maleic anhydride, phthalic anhydride, aniline and so on. The reaction is carried out preferably at a temperature of less than 100 Â°C.<br>
The cyclisation of the polyamic acids to form the polyimides can be carried out by heating, that is to say by condensation with removal of water or by other imidisation reactions with reagents. When carried out purely thermally, the imidisation of the polyamic acids is not always complete, that is to say the resulting polyimides may still contain proportions of polyamic acid. The imidisation reactions are generally carried out at a temperature of from 60 to 250 Â°C, but preferably at less than 200 ""C. In order to achieve imidisation at rather lower temperatures there are additionally mixed into the reaction mixture reagents that facilitate the removal of water. Such reagents are, for example, mixtures consisting of acid anhydrides, such as acetic acid anhydride, propionic acid anhydride, phthalic acid anhydride, trifluoroacetic acid anhydride, and tertiary amines, such as triethylamine, trimethylamine, tributylamine, pyridine, A/,/V-dimethylaniline, lutidine, collidine etc.. The amount of reagents used in that case is preferably at least two equivalents of amine and four equivalents of acid anhydride per equivalent of polyamic acid to be condensed.<br><br>
The dimidiation reaction can be carried out before or alternatively only after application to a support. The latter variant is preferred especially when the polyimide in question has poor solubility in the customary solvents.<br>
Thus the polymer material or oligomer material from the class of polyamic acids, polyamic acid esters or polyimides (and any mixtures thereof) may be obtained by or obtainable by the reaction of at least one compound represented by the general formula (I) wherein G represents a diamine group and optionally one or more additional other diamines (as e.g. given above), with one or more tetracarboxylic acid anhydrides of the general formula (IV)<br><br>

The polymers of the present invention have a molecular weight Wlyv between 1 000 and 5 000 000. preferably however between 5 000 and 2 000 000, especially advantageously however between 10 000 and 1 000 000.<br>
The number of monomer building blocks from which the polymer chains according to the invention are synthesised can vary within a wide range. It Is generally from 2 to 2000, but especially from 3 to 200.<br>
The polymers according to the invention may further contain additives such as silane-containing compounds and epoxy-containing crosslinking agents for further improving the adhesion of the polymer to a substrate. Example for silane adhesion promoters were described in the literature, for example Plast Eng, 36 (1996) (Polyimides, fundamentals and applications). The above epoxy-containing crosslinking agent preferably includes 4,4'-methylenebis(A/,N-diglyddylaniline), trimethylolpropane triglycidyl ether, ben2ene-1,2,4,5-tetracarboxylic acid 1,2:4,5-A/,A/-diglycidyldiimide, polyethylene glycol diglycidyl ether, A/,A/-diglycidylcyclohexylamine and the like.<br><br>
The polymers according to the invention may contain additives such a photosensitiser, a photoradical generator and/or a cationic photoinitiator. Example for such additives were 2,2-dimethoxyphenylethanone, mixture of diphenylmethanone and A/,A/-dimethylbenzenamine or ethyl 4-(dimethylamino)ben2oate, xanthone, thioxanthone, IRGACUREâ„¢ 184, 369. 500, 651 and 907 (Ciba), Michler's ketone, triaryl sulfonium salt and the like.<br>
The polymers according to the invention may be used as a single polymer or as mixture with other polymers, oligomers, monomers, photoactive polymers, photoactive oligomers and/or photoactive monomers. Thus the properties of the layer may be modified to give what is sought. For example, an induced pretilt angles, good surface wetting, high voltage holding ratio, a specific anchoring energy etc. may be obtained-<br>
The polymers according to the invention can then be applied to a support and, after any imidisation step which may be necessary, crosslinked by irradiation with linearly polarised light, that is to say by cycloaddition of their side-chains containing the photoreactive group, there being obtained, depending upon the direction of polarisation of the light radiated in, a preferred direction of orientation and of the angle of tilt for liquid crystals that are bought into contact with the alignment layer. By spatially selective irradiation of the molecular units according to the invention it is hence possible for very specific regions of a surface to be aligned and provided with a defined angle of tilt. At the same time the alignment layer so produced is also stabilised by the cycloaddition.<br>
Such alignment layers can be produced, for example, by first preparing a solution of the resulting polymer material, which is applied to a support, which is optionally coated with an electrode (for example a glass plate coated with indium-tin oxide (ITO)), in a spin-coating apparatus, so that homogeneous layers of 5 nanometer to 2 micrometer thickness are produced. Then, or optionally after prior imidisation, the regions to be oriented can be irradiated, for example, with a high-pressure mercury vapour lamp, a xenon lamp or a pulsed UV laser, using a polariser and optionally a mask for creating images of structures. The irradiation time is dependent upon the output of the individual lamps and can vary from a few seconds to several hours. The photoreaction<br><br>
can also be carried out, however, by irradiation of the homogeneous layer using filters that, for example, allow only the radiation suitable for the crosslinking reaction to pass through.<br>
Such alignment layers of the Invention may be used in the production of optical or electro-optical devices having at least one orientation layer as well as unstructured and structured optical elements and multi-layer systems. Thus the invention further relates to an optical or electro-optical device comprising one or more oligomers, dendrimers or polymers according to the present invention in cross-linked form.<br>
The examples which follow further illustrate the invention. They are given by way of illustration and not by way of limitation. Variations on these examples falling within the scope of the invention will be apparent to a person skilled in the art.<br>

Bâ€™ Application examples<br>
EXAMPLE B1: Application as photoalignment material<br>
This example illustrates how an alignment layer can be made of a material comprising functionalized photoreactive compounds according to the invention.<br>
A two percent by weight solution S of the photoreactive polymer formulation of<br>
Example A1 was prepared using cyclopentanone as a solvent. The solution was stirred<br>
for 30 minutes at room temperature.<br>
Solution S was spin-coated at 3000 rpm onto a glass substrate, which was then dried<br>
for 10 minutes at 180 X.<br>
The substrates were subsequently irradiated with polarized UVA light from a mercury<br>
high-pressure lamp, the direction of incidence being perpendicular to the substrate<br>
surface. For the polarization a Mote polarizer was used. By varying the expsure<br>
duration, different irradiation energies of 1, 2, 4, 8,16, 32, and 64 my/cmâ€™ were<br>
applied.<br>
The layers thus prepared showed the desired alignment properties for liquid crystals; an illustrative example is given in Example B2 below.<br><br>
Analogous experiments were made for the polymers and monomers of all Examples A2 ff. described above. Also in these cases the layers showed the desired alignment properties.<br>
EXAMPLE B2: Orientation of a liquid crystalline polymer (LCP)<br>
This example illustrates the use of an alignment layer comprising functionalized photoreactive compounds according to the invention to orient cross-linkable monomers during the making of a liquid crystalline polymer (LCP).<br>
A mixture MLCP was prepared comprising the following liquid crystalline diacrylate monomers:<br><br>
In addition to the diacrylate monomers, photoinitiator IRGACURE'â„¢ 369 from Ciba SC as well as BHT which served as an inhibitor were added to the mixture. Thus the composition of mixture MLCP was as follows:<br><br><br>
Mon3	4.7 wt. %<br>
IRGACUREâ„¢ 369	1.9 wt. %<br>
BHT	1.9 wt. %<br>
Finally, a solution S(LCP) was made by dissolving 20 wt. % of mbd:ure MLCP in anisole.<br>
Like in example B1, to produce an alignment layer the solution S was spincoated on a glass plate, dried and subsequently exposed to polarized UV-light leaving an incidence angle of 70*. Then diacrylate solution S(LCP) was spin-coated at 800 rpm for 2 minutes on top of the alignment layer. To cross-link the diacrylates the plate was then exposed to isotropic UV-light under nitrogen atmosphere for 5 minutes.<br>
Between crossed polarizers it was found that the LCP layer was well aligned according to the direction of the polarized UV-light used to inradiate the alignment layer.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
