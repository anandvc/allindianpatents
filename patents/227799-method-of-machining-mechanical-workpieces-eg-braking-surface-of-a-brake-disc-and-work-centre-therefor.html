				<td>METHOD OF MACHINING MECHANICAL WORKPIECES eg. BRAKING SURFACE OF<br>
A BRAKE DISC, AND WORK CENTRE THEREFOR<br>
The present invention relates to method of machining mechanical workpieces, in particular of<br>
machining the braking surfaces of a brake disc for vehicles, and a work centre that operates in<br>
accordance with the method.<br>
Technical field<br>
This invention concerns a method of machining mechanical workpieces, in particular of machining<br>
the flat surfaces of a brake disc for vehicles. The invention also concerns a work centre that operates<br>
in accordance with the method of the invention.<br>
Technological background<br>
The invention is particularly, though not exclusively, suited to applications in the specific field of<br>
mechanical-workpiece surface machining where a balanced centered division of the excess metal<br>
thickness removed from each of a pair of opposed surfaces is required.<br>
A typical application is that relating to the machining of the opposed flat surfaces of a brake disc for<br>
vehicles. In this case, the surface finishing (turning, for example) requires the removal of excess<br>
metal thicknesses from these surfaces in a balanced, centered manner in relation to the brake disc's<br>
median plane of symmetry, for obvious reasons of weight balancing.<br>
In this field, the above-mentioned operations are typically carried out by clamping the brake disc on<br>
the chuck of the machine tool by the engagement of gripping clamps of the workpiece-holder device,<br>
for example, a gripper or self-centering chuck, in the radial passages which are created in the disc<br>
during the casting of the semifinished workpiece, and which constitute the finned cooling ducts of<br>
the brake disc. Clamping the workpiece in this way defines a median reference plane relative to<br>
which the excess metal thicknesses to be removed from each of the flat disc surfaces are measured.<br><br>
One of the main limitations encountered in the known applications lies in the fact that the clamping<br>
of the disc in the region of the above-mentioned median plane allows only one of the disc surfaces to<br>
be machined because the tools cannot gain access to the other disc surface, i.e. the surface facing the<br>
chuck, due to the presence of the clamping device. Once one surface of the disc has been machined,<br>
the disc must be positioned and clamped on the chuck a second time to allow the other, opposite<br>
surface to be machined.<br>
This double positioning consequently involves an increase in cycle times with a corresponding<br>
extension of overall production times and increase in costs. A second positioning could also affect<br>
the precision of the required dimensions and tolerances, especially when it is considered that the<br>
machined disc surfaces must generally meet fairly tight tolerances of flatness and mutual parallelism.<br>
Description of the invention<br>
One of the main objects of the invention is to make available a method of machining mechanical<br>
workpieces, in particular of machining the flat surfaces of a brake disc for vehicles, which is<br>
designed to overcome all the limitations encountered in the prior art described above.<br>
This and other objects that will become clear from the following description are achieved by a<br>
machining method according to the present invention.<br>
Brief description of the accompanying drawings<br>
Further characteristics and advantages of the invention will be more effectively illustrated by the<br>
following detailed description of a preferred embodiment of the invention, which is given purely by<br>
way of non-limiting example with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:<br><br>
-Figures 1 to 3 show three different steps of the method of the invention,<br>
-Figure 4 is a large-scale view of a detail of the previous figures during a<br>
respective step of the method of the invention,<br>
-Figure 5 is a large-scale view that corresponds to Figure 3 and shows a<br>
variant of the apparatus for centring and clamping the workpiece that is being<br>
machined in accordance with the method of the invention.<br>
Preferred embodiment of the invention<br>
With Initial reference to figures 1 to 3, a semifinished or non-machined<br>
workpiece undergoing machining In accordance with the method of this<br>
invention is generally indicated 1. The example described relates to the<br>
application of the method of the invention in the specific field of semifinished<br>
or non-machined workpieces in the form of brake discs, whose machining<br>
requires the turning (or other processing involving removal of swarf) of<br>
opposed flat surfaces 2, 3 of the brake disc with balanced, centred removal of<br>
a pre-established excess thickness from each of the surfaces.<br>
It must, however, be understood that the example described is merely a<br>
preferred selection of application since the method of the invention could<br>
equally well be applied to any machining operation carried out on any<br>
workpiece where a particular requirement is the balanced division of the<br>
excess metal to be removed from each of a pair of opposed flat surfaces.<br>
For the sake of simplicity, this description will therefore refer hereafter to the<br>
specific application of the method to the semifinished brake disc 1, for the<br>
machining of the opposed disc surfaces 2 and 3 thereof.<br>
The brake disc, whose central axis of rotation is marked X, comprises a<br>
plurality of radial passages 4 that extend radially in the thickness of the disc<br>
between the surfaces 2 and 3. These passages are created when the<br>
semifinished workpiece is cast and are spaced angularly at regular intervals to<br><br>
act as ducts that convey air between pairs of corresponding sets of fins to cool<br>
the disc braking surfaces.<br>
The semifinished disc surface also comprises a central hub portion 5 that<br>
protrudes integrally from the annular area of the braking surfaces 2, 3 and<br>
takes the form of an outer cylindrical wall closed by a flange 6 and equipped<br>
with one or more brake-disc attachment holes.<br>
A first step of the method of the invention (Figure 1) involves the loading and<br>
clamping of the disc 1 on a handling device that is schematically illustrated and<br>
generally indicated 7 in the figures. This device is operatively controlled by<br>
station 8 of a work centre that is shown only in part. The figures show only<br>
part of a base 9 of a machine tool of the work centre, on which a workpiece-<br>
holder apparatus including a chuck 10 having a rotation axis C is supported.<br>
The handling device 7 forms part of a workpiece loading/unloading portal<br>
associated with the work station or may alternatively be fitted on the machine-<br>
tool tool-holder slide. The portion of the handling device that is attached to<br>
one or other of the structures indicated is marked 11.<br>
More specifically, the handling device 7 has a support plate 12 which is<br>
supported so as to be rotatable about a central axis C of the plate, and from<br>
which a plurality of clamps 13 for gripping the workpiece (preferably three or<br>
six clamps, with regular angular spacing) project, all in the same direction.<br>
The free ends of the clamps bear respective gripping push rods 14 that extend<br>
transversally relative to the axis C' for the centred radial gripping and clamping<br>
of the workpiece. The gripping push rods 14 advantageously form part of a<br>
gripper for the self-centred clamping of the workpiece in relation to the axis C.<br>
The handling device 7 moves along a system of controlled axes so that its<br>
position (the positioning co-ordinates) can be determined in relation to the<br>
system of working axes of the station 8.<br><br>
As shown in greater detail in Figure 4, the disc 1 is clamped on the handling<br>
device 7 by the engagement of the push rods 14 in the corresponding radial<br>
passages 4 of the disc which face the rods 14, with the disc axis X<br>
superimposed and centred on the axis C of the handling device. This<br>
engagement of the push rods in the radial passages of the disc defines a<br>
median reference plane between the surfaces 2 and 3, which is identified by<br>
the straight line marked A in figure 4. The co-ordinates of this plane (in<br>
particular the vertical height marked H in the figure) can be measured in<br>
relation to the system of working axes by the positioning of the handling<br>
device, and the plane can in turn be used to define the excess thickness of<br>
material to be removed from each of surfaces 2 and 3 so that the tools can be<br>
guided to their respective working positions. The preselected thicknesses of<br>
material to be removed are therefore divided in a balanced manner with<br>
respect to the median plane A to ensure a balanced, centred distribution of<br>
disc weights.<br>
In a second step of the method (Figure 2), the handling device 7 is brought,<br>
by movements of the tool-holder slide (or the loading/unloading portal with<br>
which the handling device is associated) to the vicinity of the chuck 10, with<br>
alignment of the axes C and C', to a position in which the outer wall of the hub<br>
portion 5 faces the gripping surfaces of the corresponding clamps 15 of the<br>
self-centring clamping apparatus of the chuck 10.<br>
In a subsequent step (Figure 3), the disc 1 is clamped on the chuck 10, and<br>
the handling device 7 is subsequently released and moved away. It should be<br>
noted that the positioning co-ordinates of the handling device 7 are<br>
measurable in relation to the reference system of the working axes, and that<br>
the co-ordinates of the median reference plane A are consequently measurable<br>
in relation to the same system. It therefore follows that the preselected<br><br>
thicknesses of excess metal to be removed are in turn measurable in relation<br>
to the positioning co-ordinates of the plane A, even when the disc is clamped<br>
on the chuck 10 once the handling device 7 has been released and moved<br>
away.<br>
In a further, subsequent step, the work station tools are driven along their<br>
respective working paths for the machining of the surfaces 2 and 3 with<br>
removal of the preselected excess thicknesses of material in a balanced,<br>
centred manner.<br>
The clamping of the disc 1 In the self-centring tool of the chuck 10<br>
advantageously allows the machine tools access to each of disc surfaces 2 and<br>
3 by means of one and only one positioning of the disc on the chuck, achieved<br>
by means of the steps described above. The configuration and size of the self-<br>
centring clamping device of the chuck are such as to allow the tool (indicated<br>
16) to have access to the surface 3 such that it can machine up to the smaller<br>
diameter of the annular braking area as shown in Figure 3.<br>
In a variant, shown in Figure 5, the self-centring clamping device of the chuck<br>
10 advantageously comprises a gripper with a tapered profile, generally<br>
indicated as 17, that includes an annular gripping element 18 with an outer<br>
surface 19 engaged along a tapered guide 20 and an opposed internal surface<br>
21 for gripping the mechanical workplece.<br>
In use, as a result of the relative sliding between the annular element and the<br>
tapered guide, brought about by an axial pulling force exerted on the annular<br>
element, the surface 21 is urged transversely relative to the axis C against the<br>
hub portion 5 so as to exert the force for clamping the disc on the chuck. Due<br>
to the axial symmetry of the tapered guide, the wedging action of the annular<br>
element is self-centring and thus ensures centred clamping of the disc on the<br>
chuck.<br><br>
Advantageously, the overall weight of the gripper 17 is less than that of<br>
devices with conventional self-centring clamps and this brings about a<br>
consequent reduction in the centrifugal forces generated during chuck rotation.<br>
The clamping forces on the chuck can thus be reduced for a given chuck<br>
speed, or the speed of rotation of the chuck can be increased for a given<br>
clamping force applied. In the first case, since the clamping forces of the chuck<br>
clamps tend to deform the workpiece, the state of deformation can be reduced<br>
by producing lower gripping forces. In the second case, on the other hand, it is<br>
possible to achieve relatively high cutting speeds that could not be used with<br>
conventional self-centring clamps.<br>
The invention therefore achieves the proposed objects by offering numerous<br>
advantages over known solutions.<br>
A first advantage lies in the fact that the method of the invention allows<br>
machining to be carried out on both of the opposed surfaces of a disc with one<br>
and only one positioning of the disc on the chuck. Workpiece loading/unloading<br>
times and hence the overall cycle time is consequently reduced.<br>
Another advantage lies in the fact that the single positioning required allows<br>
greater precision to be achieved in surface machining operations, with<br>
particular reference to the required tolerances of flatness and parallelism<br>
between opposed working surfaces of the disc.<br><br>
