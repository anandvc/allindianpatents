TITLE OF THE INVENTION<br>
TRANSMISSION APPARATUS AND RECEPTION<br>
APPARATUS<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a<br>
technical field of radio communications. More<br>
particularly, the present invention relates to a<br>
transmission apparatus and a reception apparatus<br>
used in a downlink.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
In a next generation radio access scheme<br>
for which research and development are currently<br>
being conducted, it is required to perform<br>
communication more efficiently compared with<br>
conventional schemes. In the downlink, speed-up and<br>
increase of capacity for communication are<br>
especially required. Thus, radio access schemes of<br>
a multicarrier scheme such as orthogonal frequency<br>
division multiplexing (OFDM) are highly expected.<br>
On the other hand, the uplink is different from the<br>
downlink in that speed-up and large capacity are not<br>
so strongly required for the uplink as the downlink<br>
and that transmission power of a mobile station is<br>
considerably limited compared with that of the base<br>
station and the like. Thus, the multicarrier scheme<br>
in which there is a fear that peak to average<br>
power ratio (PAPR) becomes large is not a proper<br>
scheme for the uplink. Rather, from the viewpoint<br>
of suppressing PAPR and increasing coverage of a<br>
cell, it is desirable to adopt a single carrier<br>
scheme for the uplink.<br>
By the way, there are data channels,<br>
control channels and pilot channels and the like as<br>
channels to be transmitted on the uplink, and the<br><br>
channels include various types of channels having<br>
different functions. For example, as to the pilot<br>
channels, in addition to a pilot channel for channel<br>
compensation for assigned radio resources, there is<br>
a pilot channel for channel compensation for<br>
unassigned radio resources. In addition, the<br>
control channel may include information such as<br>
transmission confirmation information (ACK/NACK) of<br>
a previously received downlink data channel and the<br>
like in addition to information (for example,<br>
information indicating a modulation scheme and a<br>
channel coding rate and the like) used for<br>
demodulating an uplink data channel. For example,<br>
the patent document 1 describes types and properties<br>
of the uplink channels.<br>
[Non-patent document 1]3GPP, TR25.814, "Physical<br>
Layer Aspects for Evolved UTRA"<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
PROBLEM TO BE SOLVED BY THE INVENTION<br>
However, a proper uplink frame considering<br>
properties of the above-mentioned various uplink<br>
channels has not yet been established. In addition,<br>
in the next generation radio access scheme, wide<br>
range of system frequency bands are prepared and it<br>
is assumed that mobile stations perform<br>
communications using the whole or a part of the<br>
bands. However, an uplink frame suitable for use in<br>
various wide and narrow bands has not yet been<br>
established.<br>
The present invention is contrived for<br>
addressing at least one of the problems, and the<br>
object is to provide a transmission apparatus and a<br>
reception apparatus for realizing a proper uplink<br>
frame for transmitting various uplink channels.<br><br>
MEANS FOR SOLVING THE PROBLEM<br>
In the present invention, a transmission<br>
apparatus used in a mobile communication system<br>
adopting a single carrier scheme in an uplink is<br>
used. The transmission apparatus includes:<br>
multiplexing means configured to multiplex a pilot<br>
channel, a control channel, and a data channel; and<br>
transmission means configured to transmit a<br>
transmission symbol including at least the pilot<br>
channel and the control channel using the uplink.<br>
The pilot channel includes a first pilot channel<br>
used for a reception apparatus to measure channel<br>
state of the uplink and a second pilot channel for<br>
compensating for a channel transmitted by the uplink.<br>
The data channel is transmitted using one or more<br>
resource blocks. The first pilot channel is<br>
transmitted using a frequency band over a plurality<br>
of resource blocks. The second pilot channel is<br>
transmitted by a resource block assigned to the<br>
transmission apparatus. Control channels of the<br>
transmission apparatus and the apparatus other than<br>
the transmission apparatus are orthogonalized with<br>
each other by a frequency division multiplexing<br>
(FDM) scheme.<br>
EFFECT OF THE INVENTION<br>
According to the present invention, a<br>
proper uplink frame for transmitting various uplink<br>
channels can be realized.<br>

PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
According to an embodiment of the present<br>
invention, a first pilot channel used for a<br>
reception apparatus to measure channel state of the<br>
uplink is transmitted by a wide band, and a second<br>
pilot channel for compensating for a channel<br>
transmitted by the uplink is transmitted by a<br>
resource block assigned to the user apparatus. Thus,<br>
quality measurement for each resource block can be<br>
properly performed, and channel compensation and the<br>
like for assigned resource blocks can be also<br>
properly performed.<br>
In addition to obtaining frequency<br>
diversity effect, in view of obtaining orthogonality<br>
easily and with reliability, control channels of the<br>
transmission apparatus and the apparatus other than<br>
the transmission apparatus may orthogonalized with<br>
each other by a distributed FDM scheme.<br>
From the viewpoint of transmitting a<br>
control channel by a resource block in a good<br>
channel state, it is desirable that the control<br>
channel of the transmission apparatus is also<br>
transmitted in a resource block assigned for data<br>
channel of the transmission apparatus.<br>
From the viewpoint of especially expecting<br>
frequency diversity effect, the control channel of<br>
the transmission apparatus may be transmitted using<br>
not only the resource block for the data channel but<br>
also a wide band equal to or greater than the<br>
resource block assigned for the data channel of the<br><br>
transmission apparatus.<br>
From the viewpoint of improving throughput<br>
considering superiority and inferiority of channel<br>
state of each user, the control channel of the<br>
transmission apparatus may be transmitted using a<br>
frequency band of one or several number of resource<br>
blocks.<br>
Data channels of the transmission<br>
apparatus and the apparatus other than the<br>
transmission apparatus may be orthogonalized with<br>
each other by the FDM scheme, and pilot channels of<br>
the transmission apparatus and the apparatus other<br>
than the transmission apparatus may be<br>
orthogonalized with each other by the CDM scheme.<br>
[Embodiment 1]<br>
Before describing the apparatus<br>
configuration and the operation according to an<br>
embodiment of the present invention, it can be<br>
considered meaningful to explain the outline of<br>
various types of channels transmitted on the uplink.<br>
Uplink channels are broadly divided into (A)<br>
Contention-based channels, (B) Contention non-<br>
permitted channels and (C) Pilot channels. The<br>
contention-based channel is a channel for which<br>
scheduling is not required in a base station before<br>
transmission, and the contention non-permitted<br>
channel is a channel (scheduled channel) for which<br>
scheduling is required in a base station before<br>
transmission. The contention-based channel includes<br>
one or more of (A1) High speed access channel, (A2)<br>
Reservation channel and (A3) Uplink synchronization<br>
channel. The contention non-permitted channel<br>
includes one or more of (B1) uplink shared data<br>
channel and (B2) uplink shared control channel.<br>
(A) [Contention-based channel]<br>
The contention-based channel to be<br>
transmitted from the mobile station without<br><br>
scheduling in the base station can be transmitted at<br>
any time by a mobile station (more generally, user<br>
apparatus (UE : user equipment) that includes a<br>
fixed station). It is desirable that the<br>
contention-based channel is transmitted over a wide<br>
band. By doing that, transmission time can be<br>
decreased. In addition, since the band is wide,<br>
frequency diversity effect can be obtained. Thus,<br>
even though signal quality deteriorates very much in<br>
a part of frequencies, power amplification (power<br>
ramping) and the like for compensating for the<br>
deterioration is not essential. Although contention<br>
may occur between users for the contention-based<br>
channel, high speed communication is available<br>
easily by the channel. Although time division<br>
multiplexing scheme (TDM) is used in the same way as<br>
the current UTRA, frequency division multiplexing<br>
and/or code division multiplexing (CDM) is performed<br>
in the present embodiment from the viewpoint of<br>
reducing contention with other users as much as<br>
possible. However, when contention against other<br>
user occurs, these users may transmit the<br>
contention-based channel again as necessary.<br>
(A1) Fast access channel<br>
The fast access channel may include a<br>
control message of a small data size, may include<br>
traffic data of a small data size, or may include<br>
both of them. One reason for limiting the data size<br>
to be small is for reducing transmission delay. For<br>
example, the control message may include information<br>
on layer 3 handover, for example. The traffic data<br>
of the small size may include an e-mail of a small<br>
information amount, a command of a game and the like.<br>
Since the user apparatus can transmit the fast<br>
access channel to the base station without any prior<br>
reservation, process time required for transmission<br>
can be small. The fast access channel is<br><br>
transmitted by one or more frequency chunks assigned<br>
beforehand. Which chunk is to be used in a<br>
plurality of frequency chunks may be reported from<br>
the base station to the user apparatus by a<br>
broadcast channel of a downlink. The content of the<br>
report may indicate that only a particular frequency<br>
chunk can be used or may indicate any one (or any<br>
number) of a plurality of particular frequency<br>
chunks can be used. The latter one is advantageous<br>
in that probability for contention between users is<br>
less than that of the former one.<br>
(A2) Reservation channel<br>
The reservation channel includes<br>
information for requesting scheduling of a<br>
contention non-permitted channel. The information<br>
may include identification information for<br>
identifying a user apparatus, traffic data type<br>
(voice, image, and the like), data size, required<br>
quality information (QoS and the like), and<br>
transmission power of the user apparatus and the<br>
like. The reservation channel is also transmitted<br>
by a frequency chunk assigned beforehand. Which<br>
chunk is to be used in a plurality of frequency<br>
chunks may be reported from the base station to the<br>
user apparatus by a broadcast channel of a downlink.<br>
(A3) Uplink Synchronization Channel<br>
In the present embodiment, signal<br>
transmission of an uplink is performed using a<br>
single carrier scheme, and equalization is performed<br>
for suppressing multipath interference. For<br>
performing effective equalization, it is desirable<br>
to maintain synchronization such that reception<br>
timing for reception from various users fall within<br>
a period of a predetermined guard interval. For<br>
maintaining the synchronization, uplink<br>
synchronization channel is used.<br>
By the way, maintaining synchronization<br><br>
can be also realized by the after-mentioned pilot<br>
cannel. Therefore, it is not essential to prepare<br>
both of the synchronization channel and the pilot<br>
channel.<br>
(B) [Contention non-permitted channel]<br>
The contention non-permitted channel is<br>
transmitted from the user apparatus according to<br>
scheduling performed in the base station.<br>
(B1) Uplink Shared Data Channel<br>
The uplink shared data channel includes<br>
both or one of traffic data and a control message of<br>
layer 3. The control message may include<br>
information on handover, information necessary for<br>
retransmission control and the like. The uplink<br>
shared data channel is assigned one or more resource<br>
blocks (or chunks) according to scheduling in time<br>
domain or both of time and frequency domains. In<br>
this case, resource assignment is scheduled in the<br>
base station such that a user related to a better<br>
transmission route (channel) in the time domain or<br>
in both of the time and frequency domains can<br>
transmit packet in priority. The number of resource<br>
blocks to be assigned is determined depending on a<br>
data rate and a data size and the like to be<br>
transmitted by the user apparatus. When there are a<br>
plurality of users requesting only a relatively low<br>
data rate, one resource block may be shared by a<br>
plurality of users. However, when a traffic size of<br>
a user exceeds a predetermined size, one user may<br>
use the whole of the resource block. In addition,<br>
one user may use a plurality of resource blocks.<br>
When one resource block is shared by a plurality of<br>
users, multiplexing in some manner is performed such<br>
that channels of a plurality of users become<br>
orthogonal in the resource block. For example,<br>
localized FDM or distributed FDM may be performed in<br>
the resource block.<br><br>
(B2) Uplink Shared Control Channel<br>
Uplink shared control channel transmits a<br>
physical control message and a layer 2 control<br>
message (FFS). As to the uplink shared data channel,<br>
resource assignment is scheduled in the base station<br>
such that a user related to a better transmission<br>
route (channel) can transmit a packet in priority.<br>
However, as to the uplink shared control channel,<br>
scheduling depending on superiority or inferiority<br>
of channel state is not essential (however, some<br>
link adaptation may be performed for the shared<br>
control channel). The base station assigns resource<br>
blocks to each user apparatus to perform scheduling<br>
to avoid contention of shared control channels. As<br>
to the uplink shared control channel, the base<br>
station performs scheduling depending on the number<br>
of users. In order to maintain packet error rate to<br>
be low, it is desirable to perform transmission<br>
power control with high precision. In addition, it<br>
is desirable to obtain frequency diversity effect by<br>
transmitting the uplink shared control channel over<br>
a wide range of frequencies so as to increase<br>
quality of reception packets.<br>
More particularly, the uplink shared<br>
control channel includes one or more of:<br>
(1)	control information related to a<br>
scheduled uplink shared data channel;<br>
(2)	control information related to a<br>
scheduled downlink shared data channel;<br>
(3)	control information for changing<br>
content of scheduling of the uplink shared data<br>
channel; and<br>
(4)	control information for performing<br>
scheduling of a downlink shared data channel.<br>
In these types of control information, (1)<br>
includes control information essential for<br>
demodulating the uplink shared data channel, and is<br><br>
essential control information that should associated<br>
with the uplink shared data channel. On the other<br>
hand, as to (2) and (4), it is not essential that<br>
they are associated with the uplink shared data<br>
channel, and they are control information (control<br>
information different from the essential control<br>
information) that are not necessarily associated<br>
with the uplink shared data channel. According to<br>
such classification method, the control information<br>
(3) related to change of scheduling content may be<br>
included in the essential control information, or<br>
may be included in control information different<br>
from the essential control information.<br>
(1) The control information (essential<br>
control information) related to scheduled uplink<br>
shared data channel is transmitted being associated<br>
with an uplink shared data channel only when the<br>
uplink shared data channel is transmitted. This<br>
control information is also called an associated<br>
control channel, and may include information<br>
necessary for demodulating shared data channel<br>
(modulation scheme, channel coding rate and the<br>
like), transmission block size, information related<br>
to retransmission control, and the like, and may be<br>
represented with information amount of about 14 bits,<br>
for example. For example, the retransmission<br>
control information may include information<br>
indicating whether a packet transmitted by the<br>
uplink shared data channel is a retransmission<br>
packet or a new packet, information indicating use<br>
method of the retransmission packet, and the like.<br>
For example, data of the retransmission packet is<br>
the same as data of a previously transmitted packet<br>
(initial transmission data, for example) in a first<br>
use method, and data of the retransmission packet<br>
may be different from data of a previously<br>
transmitted packet in a second use method. In the<br><br>
latter case, packet combining can be performed with<br>
redundancy information of error correcting coding.<br>
(2)	The control information associated<br>
with the scheduled downlink shared data channel is<br>
transmitted to the base station only when a downlink<br>
shared data channel is transmitted from the base<br>
station and the downlink shared data channel is<br>
received by the user apparatus. This control<br>
information represents transmission confirmation<br>
information, that is, whether the packet is properly<br>
received on the downlink (ACK/NACK), and it can be<br>
represented by 1 bit in a simplest case.<br>
(3)	The control information for changing<br>
content of scheduling of the uplink shared data<br>
channel is transmitted for reporting a buffer size<br>
and/or transmission power of the user apparatus to<br>
the base station. This control information may be<br>
transmitted periodically or irregularly. For<br>
example, it mat be transmitted from the user<br>
apparatus at a time when the buffer size and/or the<br>
transmission power change. The base station may<br>
change the scheduling content according to such a<br>
status change of the user apparatus. The status of<br>
the buffer size and the transmission power may be<br>
represented using an information amount of about 10<br>
bits, for example.<br>
(4)	Control information for performing<br>
scheduling for the downlink shared data channel is<br>
transmitted for reporting channel quality<br>
information (CQI: channel quality indicator) of the<br>
downlink to the base station. The CQI may be<br>
reception SIR measured by the user apparatus, for<br>
example. This information may be transmitted<br>
periodically or irregularly. For example, this<br>
information may be reported to the base station when<br>
the channel quality changes. This control<br>
information may be represented using an information<br><br>
amount of 5 bits, for example.<br>
(C) [Pilot channel]<br>
The pilot channel is a signal having a<br>
pattern that is known beforehand in the transmission<br>
side and in the reception side, and it can also be<br>
referred to as a reference signal, a known signal, a<br>
training signal and the like.<br>
The pilot channel can be transmitted from<br>
the user apparatus using the time division<br>
multiplexing (TDM), the frequency division<br>
multiplexing (FDM), code division multiplexing (CDM),<br>
or a combination of these. However, from the<br>
viewpoint of decreasing peak-to-average power ratio<br>
(PAPR), it is desirable to use a TDM scheme. By<br>
orthogonalizing a pilot channel and a data channel<br>
using the TDM scheme, the pilot channel can be<br>
correctly separated in the reception side, so that<br>
it contributes to improvement of channel estimation<br>
accuracy.<br>
The pilot channel includes a first pilot<br>
channel for CQI measurement for every resource block<br>
that has a chance to be assigned to the user<br>
apparatus in the future, and includes a second pilot<br>
channel for channel compensation of a channel<br>
transmitted by a resource block that is currently<br>
assigned to the user apparatus. As mentioned later,<br>
the first pilot channel is transmitted by a wide<br>
band including all resource blocks and the second<br>
pilot channel is transmitted only by a particular<br>
resource block assigned to the user apparatus.<br>
Fig.1 is a schematic block diagram of a<br>
transmitter according to an embodiment of the<br>
present invention. The transmitter shown in the<br>
figure is typically provided in a user apparatus.<br>

transform unit 238.<br>
The pilot channel generation unit 231<br>
generates a pilot channel used in the uplink. The<br>
pilot channel includes the above-mentioned first and<br>
the second pilot channels at least.<br>
The shared control channel generation unit<br>
233	generates a shared control channel that may<br>
include various control information. The shared<br>
control channel generation unit 233 is described<br>
with reference to Fig.3 later.<br>
The shared data channel generation unit<br>
234	generates a shared data channel transmitted by<br>
the uplink.<br>
The multiplexing unit 235 multiplexes and<br>
outputs one or more channels. It is not essential<br>
to multiplex all of the channels shown in the figure,<br>
and one or more channels are multiplexed as<br>
necessary. In the example shown in the figure,<br>
processing of time division multiplexing is<br>
performed by the multiplexing unit 235, and<br>
processing of assuagement to frequency components is<br>
performed by the mapping unit 237. Since scheduling<br>
for the time division multiplexed signal is<br>
performed based on an instruction by the base<br>
station, the signal is classified to the contention<br>
non-permitted channel.<br>
Actually, a contention-based channel is<br>
also generated and is multiplexed and transmitted as<br>
necessary. But, for the sake of simplicity of<br>
explanation, this is not shown.<br>
The discrete Fourier transform unit (DFT)<br>
236 performs Fourier transform on a signal (signal<br>
after being multiplexed in the example shown in the<br>
figure) input to the unit. In this stage of the<br>
signal processing, since the signal is discrete<br><br>
digital values, discrete Fourier transform is<br>
performed. By doing that, a sequence of signals<br>
arranged in order of time is represented in the<br>
frequency domain.<br>
The mapping unit 237 maps each signal<br>
component after Fourier transform to a predetermined<br>
subcarrier on the frequency domain. The frequency<br>
division multiplexing (FDM) scheme in this case may<br>
be a localized FDM scheme for assigning one<br>
continuous narrow band to one user or may be a<br>
distributed FDMA scheme for giving a spectrum in<br>
which a plurality of frequency components are<br>
arranged by being distributed at predetermined<br>
frequency intervals. The predetermined frequency<br>
intervals are regular intervals generally, but the<br>
predetermined frequency intervals may be irregular<br>
intervals. The mapping unit 237 performs mapping on<br>
the frequency axis by the localized FDM or by the<br>
distributed FDM.<br>
The inverse fast Fourier transform unit<br>
238 performs inverse fast Fourier transform on the<br>
signal components after mapping so as to output a<br>
sequence of signals arranged in order of time.<br>
By the way, the distributed FDM may be<br>
realized by Variable Spreading and Chip Repetition<br>
Factors - CDM (VSCRF-CDM) scheme and the like.<br>
Fig.2 shows a schematic block diagram of a<br>
receiver according to an embodiment of the present<br>
invention. The receiver shown in the figure is<br>
provided in a base station typically. Fig.2 shows a<br>
discrete Fourier transform unit (DFT) 241, a mapping<br>
unit 242, an inverse fast Fourier transform unit 243<br>
and a multiplexing unit 244.<br>
The discrete Fourier transform unit (DFT)<br>
241 performs Fourier transform on a signal<br>
(reception signal in the example shown in the<br>
figure) input to the unit. Accordingly, a sequence<br><br>
of signals arranged in order of time can be<br>
represented in the frequency domain.<br>
The mapping unit 242 extracts<br>
predetermined subcarrier components from signals<br>
after Fourier transform. Accordingly, signals that<br>
are multiplexed by the localized FDM or the<br>
distributed FDM are separated, for example.<br>
The inverse fast Fourier transform unit<br>
242 performs inverse fast Fourier transform on<br>
signal components after being separated to output a<br>
sequence of signals arranged in order of time.<br>
The demultiplexing unit 244 separates one<br>
or more channels to output them. In the example<br>
shown in the figure, signals mapped to the frequency<br>
components are restored to signals before mapping by<br>
the demapping unit 242, and the separation of the<br>
time multiplexed signal is performed by the<br>
demultiplexing unit 244.<br>
One or more channels generated in the<br>
generation unit of each channel are time-multiplexed<br>
(properly switched) by the multiplexing unit 235,<br>
and the multiplexed signal is input to the DFT 236<br>
so that the signal is transformed to a signal in the<br>
frequency domain. The signal after transform is<br>
properly mapped to the frequency component by the<br>
mapping unit 237, and input to the IFFT 238 so as to<br>
be converted to time series signals. After that,<br>
the signal is transmitted by radio via process<br>
elements such as the RF unit 14 shown in Fig.1.<br>
This signal is received by the receiver shown in<br>
Fig.2. The reception signal is input to the DFT 241,<br>
and is transformed into a signal in the frequency<br>
domain. The transformed signal is a signal mapped<br>
to the frequency component, and separated by the<br>
demapping unit 242 to a signal before mapping. The<br>
separated signal is transformed to time series<br>
signals, and the time-multiplexed signal sequence is<br><br>
properly demultiplexed by the demultiplexing unit<br>
244, and further demodulation process and the like<br>
is performed by process elements not shown in the<br>
figure.<br>
Fig.3 shows a detailed diagram of the<br>
shared control channel generation unit 233. Fig.3<br>
shows switches 251, 252 and 253, modulation and<br>
coding units 255, 256, 257 and 258, and a<br>
multiplexing unit 259. Each switch provides each<br>
channel that is input to one end (left side of the<br>
figure) to another end according to an instruction<br>
signal (not shown in the figure) on the shared<br>
control channel. The content of the instruction<br>
signal determines how to configure the shared<br>
control channel, that is, which control information<br>
is included in the shared control channel. In the<br>
example shown in the figure, the figure shows (1)<br>
essential control information, (2) transmission<br>
confirmation information of downlink channel<br>
(information indicating acknowledgement (ACK) and<br>
negative acknowledgement (NACK)), (3) information<br>
for changing content of scheduling and (4) channel<br>
state information (CQI) indicating reception quality<br>
of downlink pilot channel.<br>
Each of the modulation and coding unit<br>
performs data modulation on a channel input to the<br>
unit using an instructed modulation scheme, and<br>
performs channel coding using an instructed coding<br>
scheme. The modulation scheme and the coding scheme<br>
used for each channel may be different or same<br>
schemes may be used for more than one channel. The<br>
modulation scheme or the coding scheme may be<br>
fixedly set so as to be unchanged.<br>
The multiplexing unit 259 multiplexes each<br>
channel to generate and output the shared control<br>
channel.<br>
In transmission of the shared control<br><br>
channel in the conventional technique, the<br>
modulation scheme and the coding scheme are fixed,<br>
and it is intended to obtain required quality by<br>
controlling transmission power control. However, in<br>
view of increasing quality of channel and effective<br>
use of resources, it is desirable to perform further<br>
link adaptation on transmission of the shared<br>
control channel. As a method for performing link<br>
adaptation, there are adaptive modulation and coding<br>
(AMC), and transmission power control (TPC).<br>
Fig.4 shows frequency bands used in the<br>
communication system. The frequency band provided<br>
to the system (to be also referred to as whole<br>
frequency band or system band) includes a plurality<br>
of system frequency blocks, so that the user<br>
apparatus can perform communication using one or<br>
more of resource blocks included in the system<br>
frequency blocks. The resource block is also called<br>
a chunk or a frequency chunk. In general, one chunk<br>
may include one or more carries (to be also referred<br>
to as a subcarrier). But, in an embodiment of the<br>
present invention, a single carrier scheme is<br>
adopted so that one chunk includes only one carrier.<br>
In the example shown in Fig.4, the system<br>
band is 10 MHz, the system frequency block is 5 MHz,<br>
and the system band includes two system frequency<br>
blocks. For the sake of simplicity of drawing, the<br>
system frequency band 2 is not shown. The resource<br>
block is 1.25 MHz, and one system frequency block<br>
includes four resource blocks. Which can be used in<br>
the two system frequency blocks by the user<br>
apparatus is determined by the base station based on<br>
a bandwidth by which the user apparatus can perform<br>
communication and a number of users performing<br>
communication in the system. The bandwidth of the<br>
system frequency block is designed as a band by<br>
which every user apparatus that may perform<br><br>
communication in the system can perform<br>
communication. In other words, the bandwidth of the<br>
system frequency block is determined as a maximum<br>
transmission bandwidth of a user apparatus of a<br>
minimum grade that can be assumed. Therefore, a<br>
user apparatus that can only perform communication<br>
using the band of 5 MHz is assigned only one of the<br>
system frequency blocks, but, a user apparatus that<br>
can perform communication using a band of 10 MHz may<br>
be assigned a band such that the user apparatus can<br>
use both of the system frequency blocks. In the<br>
present embodiment, although a subframe may be<br>
called a transmission time interval (TTI) such as<br>
0.5ms, for example, any proper interval may be used.<br>
These value examples are merely an example, and any<br>
proper values may be used.<br>
The user apparatus transmits an uplink<br>
pilot channel to the base station. The base station<br>
determines (performs scheduling) one or more<br>
resource blocks to be used for the user apparatus to<br>
transmit the shared data channel based on the<br>
reception quality of the uplink pilot channel. The<br>
content of the scheduling (scheduling information)<br>
is reported to the user apparatus using an downlink<br>
shared control channel or other channel. The user<br>
apparatus transmits an uplink shared data channel<br>
using an assigned resource block. In this case, the<br>
shared control channel (shared control channel<br>
including essential control information) associated<br>
with the uplink shared data channel is transmitted<br>
using the same resource block. As mentioned above,<br>
the uplink shared control channel may include<br>
control information other than the essential control<br>
information.<br>
Resource blocks assigned to a user may<br>
change as time advances. The resource blocks<br>
assigned to the user may comply with a frequency<br><br>
hopping pattern. The content of the hopping pattern<br>
may be known before start of communication between<br>
the base station and the user apparatus, and may be<br>
reported to the user apparatus from the base station<br>
as necessary. From the viewpoint for maintaining<br>
average signal quality of the uplink channel, it is<br>
desirable to use not only a particular resource<br>
block but also various resource blocks.<br>
Figs.5A-5C show detailed concrete examples<br>
how information of a user A and a user B are<br>
multiplexed in a subframe. In the example shown in<br>
Fig.5A, pilot channels and data channels are time-<br>
multiplexed. Information of the user A and the user<br>
B are multiplexed using the distributed FDM. In the<br>
example of Fig.5B, pilot channels and data channels<br>
are time-multiplexed and the data channels of the<br>
user A and the user B are multiplexed using the<br>
distributed FDM similarly to Fig.5A, but the pilot<br>
channels of the user A and the user B are<br>
multiplexed by CDM. In the example of Fig.5C, pilot<br>
channels and the data channels are time-multiplexed,<br>
and the data channels of the user A and the user B<br>
are multiplexed by the localized FDM.<br>
Fig.6A shows a mapping example of<br>
information of each user according to an embodiment<br>
of the present invention. Although the range shown<br>
in the figure is the whole frequency band and one<br>
subframe, the range in the frequency axis direction<br>
may be within a range of one system frequency block.<br>
For the sake of description, a period in a subframe<br>
is divided into first - fourth time slots in order<br>
of elapse of time. In the first time slot, first<br>
pilot channels from all users are multiplexed and<br>
transmitted. The all users include all of users<br>
that may transmit some channels in the future in<br>
addition to users transmitting the uplink data<br>
channel and users transmitting the uplink control<br><br>
channel. As mentioned above, the first pilot<br>
channel is a pilot channel for measuring CQI for all<br>
resource blocks having a chance to be assigned to<br>
the user apparatus in the future. Multiplexing of<br>
the first pilot channels for all users may be<br>
performed by FDM, CDM or both of them.<br>
Control channels are mapped to the second<br>
time slot. Control channels of each user are<br>
orthogonalized with each other by the distributed<br>
FDM. As mentioned above, as information included in<br>
the shared control channel, there are essential<br>
control information essential for demodulating the<br>
shared data channel and control information (control<br>
information other than the essential control<br>
information) other than that. In the example shown<br>
in the figure, users B, C and D transmit control<br>
channels including control information other than<br>
essential control information. Like the first pilot<br>
channel, the users B, C and D distribute the control<br>
channels over the whole frequency band (or the whole<br>
of the system frequency block) to transmit them to<br>
the base station. It is assumed that the users B, C<br>
and D do not transmit a data channel in any resource<br>
block in this subframe. The user A is assigned one<br>
resource block, and the user A transmits a data<br>
channel in the third time slot using the resource<br>
block. A control channel (including essential<br>
control information and control information other<br>
than that) of the user A is transmitted using<br>
frequencies in the resource block assigned to the<br>
user A. The control channel of the user A and<br>
control channels of other users are orthogonalized<br>
with each other using the distributed FDM.<br>
In the fourth time slot, the second pilot<br>
channel is mapped. As mentioned above, the second<br>
pilot channel is a pilot channel for channel<br>
compensation for a channel to be transmitted by a<br><br>
resource block that is currently assigned to the<br>
user apparatus. Also in this fourth time slot,<br>
first pilot channels transmitted over wide band for<br>
CQI measurement may be multiplexed and transmitted<br>
by a plurality of users. Also in this case, it is<br>
possible to perform channel compensation for a<br>
channel transmitted using the resource block<br>
currently assigned to the user apparatus by using a<br>
part of the first pilot channel transmitted over the<br>
wide band.<br>
By the way, for the sake of simplicity of<br>
the drawing, although any data channel of users<br>
other than the user A is not shown, data channels<br>
and the like of some sort of users (other than the<br>
users B, C and D) are mapped to resource blocks<br>
other than the resource block assigned to the user A<br>
in actuality.<br>
As to an uplink channel received from the<br>
user A, the base station estimates the channel state<br>
of the resource block based on the second pilot<br>
channel, and determines compensation content (phase<br>
rotation amount and power and the like) to be<br>
performed on the control channel and the data<br>
channel so as to perform the compensation. In<br>
addition, it is determined which resource block<br>
becomes high quality for the user A in later<br>
subframes based on the first pilot channel. The<br>
base station performs retransmission control and the<br>
like based on uplink channels (control information<br>
other than the essential control information)<br>
received from the users B, C and D. In addition,<br>
when resource assignment request of an uplink has<br>
been received, the base station determines which<br>
resource block becomes high quality for the user B,<br>
C or D based on the received first pilot channel.<br>
From the viewpoint that the base station<br>
determines superiority or inferiority of the channel<br><br>
state of each user for each resource block, it is<br>
desirable that the first pilot channel is<br>
transmitted using a wide band. From the viewpoint<br>
of maintaining minimum reception quality in the base<br>
station by increasing frequency diversity effect, it<br>
is desirable that control channels of the users B, C<br>
and D for which any particular resource block is not<br>
assigned are distributed to a wide band like the<br>
example shown in the figure. From the viewpoint of<br>
transmitting a control channel in a good channel<br>
state as much as possible, it is desirable that the<br>
control channel of the user A to which a particular<br>
resource block is assigned is transmitted by the<br>
assigned resource block as the example shown in the<br>
figure. In this case, the second pilot channel<br>
transmitted by the assigned resource block can be<br>
also used for demodulation of the control channel of<br>
the user A.<br>
Fig.6B shows a mapping example of<br>
information of each user according to an embodiment<br>
of the present invention. Expedient time slots are<br>
divided to five that are first to fifth slots. The<br>
firs, second, fourth and fifth time slots are the<br>
same as the first to fourth time slots of Fig.6A.<br>
However, in Fig.6B, a control channel that includes<br>
control information other than the essential control<br>
information of user A is transmitted in the third<br>
time slot (before the data channel of the user A is<br>
transmitted). In the example shown in the figure,<br>
in control channels of the user A, the essential<br>
control information is transmitted by the second<br>
time slot, and control information other than the<br>
essential control information is transmitted by the<br>
third time slot. Such a scheme is advantageous when<br>
information amount of control information other than<br>
the essential control information is large (for<br>
example, when control information other than the<br><br>
essential control information is large to a degree<br>
in which it is difficult to transmit using the<br>
scheme shown in Fig.6A).<br>
Fig.7 shows a mapping example of<br>
information of each user according to an embodiment<br>
of the present invention. Generally, although this<br>
example is similar to the example shown in Fig.6A,<br>
this example is deferent in that each of the control<br>
channels (including only control information other<br>
than essential control information) transmitted by<br>
the users B, C and D falls within a range of a<br>
resource block instead of being distributed over the<br>
whole frequency band. When a channel state on a<br>
particular resource block is relatively good, it is<br>
desirable that the control channel is transmitted by<br>
a particular resource block as shown in Fig.7.<br>
Fig.8 shows a mapping example of<br>
information of each user according to an embodiment<br>
of the present invention. Generally, although this<br>
example is similar to the example shown in Fig.6A,<br>
this example is deferent in that not only the<br>
control channels (including only control information<br>
other than essential control information)<br>
transmitted by the users B, C and D but also the<br>
control channel of the user A are distributed over<br>
the whole frequency band.<br>
Fig. 9 shows a mapping example of<br>
information of each user according to an embodiment<br>
of the present invention. Although only the data<br>
channel of user A is shown in the mapping examples<br>
of Figs.6A-8, data channels of other users are shown<br>
in Fig.9. Fig.9 shows a mapping example for two<br>
subframes. As shown in the figure, mapping methods<br>
may change variously as time advances.<br>
