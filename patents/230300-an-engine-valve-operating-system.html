PROCESS FOR THE PREPARATION OF N-ALKYL-2(HYDROXY-4 BENZOYU- 3 BENZOFURANS AND ITS INTERMEDIATES THEREOF<br>
The present invention relates to a novel process for the preparation of 2-(n-alkyl)-3-(4-hydroxybenzoyl)benzofurans and intermediates for its implementation.<br>
There is always a search for alternative routes for the preparation of 2-(n-alkyl)-3-(4-hydroxybenzoyl)benzofurans and in particular of 2-(n-butyl)-3-(4-hydroxybenzoyl)-5-nitrobenzofuran, an intermediate for the antiarrhythmic dronedarone.<br>
In FR-A-2 665 444, 2-(n-butyl)-3-(4-hydroxybenzoyl)-5-nitrobenzofuran is prepared by the reaction of 2-(n-butyl)-5-nitrobenzofuran (NBBF) with anisoyl chloride in the presence of tin tetrachloride in dichloroethane and then reaction with aluminium chloride in dichloroethane.<br>
The major problem of this synthesis is the use of p-anisic acid or its acid chloride, which are expensive reactants.<br>
Moreover, NBBF can be prepared from 2-coumaranone, according to the technique disclosed in FR-A-2 803 846, or from 2-hydroxybenzaldehyde.<br>
According to FR-A-2 803 846, NBBF can be obtained by reacting 2-coumaranone with pentanoic anhydride and a pentanoic acid salt to produce a mixture of tautomers (3-(1-hydroxypentylidene)-5-nitro-3H-benzofuran-2-one and 3-pentanoyl-5-nitro-3H-benzofuran-2-one) which is subjected to the action of 40% sulphuric acid in acetic acid to produce the expected NBBF.<br>
It would therefore be desirable to have available a process for the preparation of 2-(n-alkyl)-3-(4-hydroxybenzoyI)benzofurans and particularly of 2-(n-butyl)-3-(4-hydroxybenzoyl)-5-nitrobenzofuran which has a good yield, which is simple to carry out and which results in a product with a good purity.<br>
In point of fact, after lengthy research, the Applicant Company has discovered with astonishment that the reaction of 3-(1-hydroxyalkylidene)-3H-benzofuran-2-one compounds or their 3-alkanoyl-3H-benzofuran-2-one ketonic tautomeric forms in the<br><br>
presence of a concentrated acid catalyst promotes the formation of 2-(n-alkyl)-3-carboxybenzofurans.<br>
Another surprising component of this synthetic route is the selective reaction in the para position of a phenol ether, unsubstituted in the 2 and 6 positions, in a Friedel-Crafts reaction, making it possible to obtain essentially a 4-alkoxy derivative and very little 2-alkoxy derivative.<br>
This distinctive feature makes it possible to carry out the dealkylation stage on the mixture of the 4-alkoxy derivative and of the 2-alkoxy derivative without having to perform a preliminary separation and to obtain the desired product with a good yield and a good purity.<br>
For this reason, a subject-matter of the present application is a process for the preparation of a 2-(n-alkyl)-3-(4-hydroxybenzoyl)benzofuran of formula (I)<br><br>
in which R represents a linear or branched alkyl radical including from 1 to 5 carbon atoms and R1 represents a linear or branched alkyl radical including from 1 to 3 carbon atoms, a linear or branched alkoxy radical including from 1 to 3 carbon atoms, a halogen atom or a nitro radical,<br>
in which<br>
a)     a 2-aIkyl-3-carboxybenzofuran of formula (II)<br><br><br>
in which R and R1 have the meanings already indicated, is reacted with a halogenating agent to produce the compound of formula (III)<br><br>
in which X represents a halogen atom and R and R1 have the meanings all indicated,<br>
b)     then the compound of formula (III) is reacted with an alkyl phenyl ether of fc<br><br>
in which R2 represents a linear or branched alkoxy radical including from 1 carbon atoms,<br>
in the presence of a Lewis acid, to produce a mixture of 2-alkyl-3-(4-alkoxybenzoyl)benzofuran of formula (IV) and of 2-aIkyl-3-(2-alkoxybenzoyl)benzofuran of formula (IVa)<br><br><br><br>
in which R, R1 and R2 have the meanings already indicated,<br>
c)      and the mixture is subjected to a dealkylation reaction to produce the product of formula (I), which is isolated, if desired.<br>
In the formula (I) and in what follows, the term "linear or branched alkyl radical including from 1 to 3 carbon atoms" represents, for example, a propyl, ethyl or methyl radical. The term "linear or branched alkyl radical including from 1 to 5 carbon atoms" represents, for example, an n-pentyl, n-propyl or ethyl radical, preferably an n-butyl radical. The term "linear or branched alkoxy radical including from 1 to 5 carbon atoms" represents, for example, a propoxy or ethoxy radical, preferably a methoxy radical. The term "halogen atom" or "the X substituent" represents, for example, an iodine or bromine atom, preferably a chlorine atom.<br>
The benzofuran ring system can comprise 4 R1 radicals, preferably 2 R1 radicals and particularly just 1 R1 radical.<br>
The R1 radical is preferably situated in the 5 or 7 position and particularly in the 5 position.<br>
Use may be made, as halogenating agent, for example, of phosphorus trichloride PCI3, phosphorus pentachloride PCI5, phosphorus oxychloride POCI3, oxalyl chloride (COCI)2, phosgene COCI2 and, particularly, thionyl chloride SOCI2.<br>
Under preferred conditions for implementing the invention, the amount of halogenating agent employed is such that the halogenating agent/compound of formula (II) molar ratio has a value from 1 to 5, preferably from 1.1 to 2.<br><br>
Under other preferred conditions for implementing the invention, the halogenation reaction takes place at a temperature lying between ambient temperature and the reflux temperature of the reaction medium.<br>
Under yet other preferred conditions for implementing the invention, the reaction of the 2-a!kyl-3-carboxybenzofuran of formula (II) with the halogenating agent is carried out in the presence of an organic solvent which is advantageously a halogenated aliphatic and/or aromatic hydrocarbon, particularly chlorobenzene, or an alkyl phenyl ether, particularly anisole.<br>
Under preferred conditions for implementing the invention, the amount of alkyl phenyl ether employed is such that the alkyl phenyl ether/compound of formula (III) molar ratio ranges from 1 to 10, preferably from 1 to 2, and in particular is equal to approximately 1.2.<br>
Under other preferred conditions for implementing the invention, the temperature of the reaction between the compound of formula (III) and the alkyl phenyl ether is between -5°C and ambient temperature, preferably between 0°C and 5°C.<br>
This reaction is advantageously carried out in the presence of an organic solvent which is preferably a halogenated aliphatic and/or aromatic hydrocarbon, particularly chlorobenzene, or an alkyl phenyl ether, particularly anisole.<br>
The Lewis acid used in the reaction between the compound of formula (III) and the alkyl phenyl ether can, for example, be an aluminium halide, a boron halide, a titanium halide, a tin halide, a bismuth halide or an iron halide, and preferably aluminium chloride.<br>
Under preferred conditions for implementing the invention, the amount of Lewis acid employed is such that the Lewis acid/compound of formula (III) molar ratio ranges from 1 to 10, preferably from 1 to 1.5, and in particular is equal to approximately 1.2.<br>
Use may be made, in carrying out the dealkylation, for example, of the techniques described in Greene, T. W., Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, Chapter 3, John Wiley and Sons, New York, 3rd edition, 1999, pages 250-254.<br><br>
Preferably, use is made, as dealkylating agent, of pyridine hydrochloride, hydriodic acid or hydrobromic acid and, in particular, heating is carried out in the presence of a Lewis acid.<br>
The Lewis acid used in the dealkylation reaction can be, for example, an aluminium halide, a boron halide, a titanium halide, a tin halide, a bismuth halide or an iron halide and preferably aluminium chloride.<br>
Under preferred conditions for implementing the invention, the amount of Lewis acid employed in the dealkylation stage is such that the Lewis acid/compound of formula (IV) and (IVa) molar ratio ranges from 1 to 10, preferably from 2 to 5, and in particular is equal to approximately 3.<br>
The heating temperature in the dealkylation stage can range from 40°C to 100°C, preferably from 50°C to 65°C.<br>
The dealkylation is carried out in particular in the presence of an organic solvent which is preferably a halogenated aliphatic and/or aromatic hydrocarbon, more particularly chlorobenzene.<br>
The compounds of formula (II) can be prepared by treatment of 3-(1-hydroxyalkylidene)-3H-benzofuran-2-one compounds or their 3-alkanoyl-3H-benzofuran-2-one ketonic tautomeric forms using an acid catalyst in concentrated aqueous solution at 80 to 95%, for example using 90% concentrated sulphuric acid, preferably in a carboxylic acid and in particular in acetic acid.<br>
The intermediate compounds of formulae (II) and (III) have very advantageous properties. They readily result, by a Friedel-Crafts reaction, essentially in a 4-alkoxy derivative and very little 2-alkoxy derivative, generally in a ratio of 95/5 to 97/3.<br>
This unexpected property makes it possible to carry out the dealkylation stage on the mixture of the 4-alkoxy derivative and of the 2-alkoxy derivative without having to perform a preliminary separation and thus to obtain the desired product with a good yield and a good purity.<br><br>
For this reason, another subject-matter of the present application is a compound of formula (V)<br><br>
in which R3 represents a hydroxyl radical or, preferably, has the meaning of X, R4 represents a linear or branched alkyl radical including from 2 to 5 carbon atoms and R\ represents a nitro radical.<br>
The term "linear or branched alkyl radical including from 2 to 5 carbon atoms" represents, for example, an ethyl, n-propyl or pentyl radical and preferably an n-butyl radical.<br>
The benzofuran ring system can comprise 2 R^ radicals and preferably just 1 R\ radical.<br>
The R\ radical is preferably situated in the 5 or 7 position and particularly in the 5 position.<br>
Finally, a subject-matter of the present application is a process for the preparation of the 2-(n-alkyi)-3-carboxybenzofurans of formula (II), characterized in that a 3-(1-hydroxyalkylidene)-3H-benzofuran-2-one of formula (VI):<br><br>
or its 3-aIkanoyl-3H-benzofuran-2-one ketonic tautomeric form of formula (VII):<br><br><br>
in which R4 has the meaning already indicated and R'1 has the meaning already indicated, is treated by heating, preferably in a carboxylic acid, in particular in acetic acid, and by an acid catalyst in a concentrated aqueous solution at at least 80% by weight, preferably between 80% and 95% by weight, for example a Bronsted acid, such as hydrochloric acid and particularly sulphuric acid, at between 80% and 95% by weight, in particular 90% concentrated, and then in that the expected product of formula (II) is isolated.<br>
The reaction can be carried out at atmospheric pressure or under pressure.<br>
The preferred conditions for implementing the process which are described above also apply to the other subject-matters of the invention targeted above, in particular to the compounds of formula (V).<br>
