FIELD OF THE INVENTION:<br>
The present invention relates to detection of liquid metal stirring during casting with an electromagnetic stirrer. It provides for a device and a method for non-intrusive detection of liquid metal/alloys stirring.<br>
BACKGROUND AND PRIOR ART:<br>
During electromagnetic stirring of liquid metals and alloys undergoing solidification, the solid fraction progressively increases. Stirring .will stop once the solid fraction reaches a critical value, usually known as the coherency point. It is useful to detect experimentally when this coherency point is reached and stirring stops. Detection of stirring by conventional flow visualization methods do not work for liquid metals and alloys as the medium is opaque. Other methods such as insertion of thermocouples or periodic sampling are intrusive in nature. However, the present invention relates to a device and a method for detection of stirring of liquid metal in presence of electromagnetic forces which is completely non-intrusive.<br>
Eddy currents are induced in all metals when subjected to an external magnetic field. By Fleming's left hand rule, the induced eddy current along with the magnetic field produces a net mechanical force known as Lorentz force. The equations for the calculation of the Lorentz force is mathematically represented below:<br><br><br>
J is the current density A/m2<br>
μis the permeability of the metal H/m<br>
μ is the conductivity The mechanical forces given by the vector cross products are as follows:<br>
Fz = JBr<br>
Fr = JBz<br>
F0 = O If the metal is in liquid state then the above forces result in stirring of the metal. Theoretically, from the above equations it can be seen that the fluid velocity (or stirring) changes the resultant Lorentz force.<br>
In the case of a linear electromagnetic stirrer, the net Lorentz force is in the vertical direction (i.e. along the axis of the stirrer, as shown in figure 1). This net Lorentz force in the vertical direction can be measured by weighing the metal (in solid or liquid state) with a suitable weighing instrument. It is observed that the weight change in liquid metal is different from that measured in a solid metal under identical conditions. Hence, by measuring the weight change, one can predict whether the metal is stirring or not.<br>

In another embodiment, the present invention relates to a device and a method for detection of stirring of liquid metal in presence of electromagnetic forces which is completely non-intrusive. As against the existing methods, the present method is completely non intrusive or location specific. The technique is applicable for casting processes involving electromagnetic stirring.<br>
Scientific Principle of the present invention:<br>
Eddy currents are induced in all metals when subjected to an external magnetic field. By Fleming's left hand rule, the induced eddy current along with the magnetic field produces a net mechanical force known as Lorentz force. The equations for the calculation of the Lorentz force is mathematically represented below:<br><br><br><br>
If the metal is in liquid state then the above forces result in stirring of the metal. Theoretically, from the above equations it can be seen that the fluid velocity (or stirring) changes the resultant Lorentz force.<br>
In the case of a linear electromagnetic stirrer, the net Lorentz force is in the vertical direction (i.e. along the axis of the stirrer, as shown in figl). This net Lorentz force in the vertical direction can be measured by weighing the metal (in solid or liquid state) with a suitable weighing instrument. It is observed that the weight change in liquid metal is different from that measured in a solid metal under identical conditions. Hence, by measuring the weight change, one can predict whether the metal is stirring or not.<br>
The invention is further elaborated with the help of following examples. However, these examples should not be construed to limit the scope of invention.<br><br>
Example 1:<br>
The linear electromagnetic stirrer is powered by a 3-phase alternating supply, to generate the required forces. There is a crucible made of electrically non-conducting material placed in the core of a linear electromagnetic stirrer. The crucible is closed at one end by a dummy block. A standard calibrated load cell (strain guage rosette) is attached underneath the dummy block. Care is taken to see that the crucible or the dummy block does not touch the sides of the electromagnetic stirrer. For accurate reading the crucible along with the dummy block should be freely suspended on the load cell. The electrical output from the load cell is calibrated, amplified and connected to a digital readout.<br>
Example 2:<br>
The liquid metal is introduced into the crucible at a specified temperature. The metal starts stirring due to the action of electromagnetic forces. The intensity of stirring depends on the strength of the imposed magnetic field. The load cell continuously monitors the "weight" of the stirring melt under the action of electromagnetic forces. The metal is cooled by a suitable cooling arrangement. As the metal solidifies it is observed that there is an appreciable change in the weight of the metal measured by the load cell (fig 2). When there is no more weight change recorded by the load cell, it is concluded that stirring has stopped.<br><br>
