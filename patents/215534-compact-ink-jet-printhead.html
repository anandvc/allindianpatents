				<td>COMPACT INK JET PRINTHEAD<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0001] The subject invention generally relates to ink<br>
jet printing, and more particularly to a thin film ink jet<br>
printhead having a high nozzle packing density.<br>
[0002]" The art of ink jet printing is relatively well<br>
developed. Commercial products such as computer printers,<br>
graphics plotters, and facsimile machines have been<br>
implemented with ink jet technology for producing printed<br>
media. The contributions of Hewlett-Packard Company to ink<br>
jet technology are described, for example, in various<br>
articles in the Hewlett-Packard Journal. Vol. 36, No. 5<br>
(May 1985); Vol. 39, No. 5 (October 1988); Vol. 43, No. 4<br>
(August 1992); Vol. 43, No. 6 (December 1992); and Vol. 45,<br>
No. 1 (February 1994); all incorporated herein by<br>
reference.<br>
[0003] Generally, an ink jet image is formed pursuant to<br>
precise placement on a print medium of ink drops emitted by<br>
an ink drop generating device known as an ink jet<br>
printhead. Typically, an ink jet printhead is supported on<br>
a movable print carriage that traverses over the surface of<br>
the print medium and is controlled to eject drops of ink at<br><br>
appropriate times pursuant to command of a microcomputer or<br>
other controller, wherein the timing of the application of<br>
the ink drops is intended to correspond to a pattern of<br>
pixels of the image being printed.<br>
[0004] A typical Hewlett-Packard ink jet printhead<br>
includes an array of precisely formed nozzles in an orifice<br>
plate that is attached to an ink barrier layer which in<br>
turn is attached to a thin film substructure that<br>
implements ink firing heater resistors and apparatus for<br>
enabling the resistors. The ink barrier layer defines ink<br>
channels including ink chambers disposed over associated<br>
ink firing resistors, and the nozzles in the orifice plate<br>
are aligned with associated ink chambers. Ink drop<br>
generator regions are formed by the ink chambers and<br>
portions of the thin film substructure and the orifice<br>
plate that are adjacent the ink chambers.<br>
[0005] The thin film substructure is typically comprised<br>
of a substrate such as silicon on which are formed various<br>
thin film layers that form thin film ink firing resistors,<br>
apparatus for enabling the resistors, and also intercon-<br>
nections to bonding pads that are provided for external<br>
electrical connections to the printhead. The ink barrier<br>
layer is typically a polymer material that is laminated as<br>
a dry film to the thin film substructure, and is designed<br>
to be photodefinable and both UV and thermally curable. In<br>
an ink jet printhead of a slot feed design, ink is fed from<br>
one or more ink reservoirs to the various ink chambers<br>
through one or more ink feed slots formed in the substrate.<br>
[0006] An example of the physical arrangement of the<br>
orifice plate, ink barrier layer, and thin film<br>
substructure is illustrated at page 44 of the Hewlett-<br>
Packard Journal of February 1994, cited above. Further<br>
examples of ink jet printheads are set forth in commonly<br><br>
assigned U.S. Patent 4,719,477 and U.S. Patent 5,317,346,<br>
both of which are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
[0007] Considerations with thin film ink jet printheads<br>
include increased substrate size and/or substrate fragility<br>
as more ink drop generators and/or ink feed slots are<br>
employed. There is accordingly a need for an ink jet<br>
printhead that is compact and has a large number of ink<br>
drop generators.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DISCLOSURE<br>
In the following detailed description and in the<br>
several figures of the drawing, like elements are<br>
identified with like reference numerals.<br>
[0020] In the following detailed description and in the<br>
several figures of the drawing, like elements are<br>
identified with like reference numerals.<br>
[0021] Referring now to FIG. 1 - 4, schematically<br>
illustrated therein are unsealed schematic plan views and<br>
perspective views of an ink jet printhead 100 in which the<br>
invention can be employed and which generally includes (a)<br>
a thin film substructure or die 11 comprising %a substrate<br>
such as silicon and having various thin film layers formed<br>
thereon, (b) an ink barrier layer 12 disposed on the thin<br><br>
film substructure 11, and (c) an orifice or nozzle plate 13<br>
laminarly attached to the top of the ink barrier 12.<br>
[0022] The thin film substructure 11 comprises an<br>
integrated circuit die that is formed for example pursuant<br>
to conventional integrated circuit techniques, and as<br>
schematically depicted in FIG. 5 generally includes a<br>
silicon substrate 111a, an FET gate and dielectric layer<br>
111b, a resistor layer 111c, and a first metallization<br>
layer llld. Active devices such as drive FET circuits<br>
described more particularly herein are formed in the top<br>
portion of the silicon substrate 111a and the FET gate and<br>
dielectric layer 111b, which includes a gate oxide layer,<br>
polysilicon gates, and a dielectric layer adjacent the<br>
resistor layer 111c. Thin film heater resistors 56 are<br>
formed by the respective patterning of the resistor layer<br>
111c and the first metallization layer llld. The thin film<br>
substructure further includes a composite passivation layer<br>
llle comprising for example a silicon nitride layer and a<br>
silicon carbide layer, and a tantalum mechanical<br>
passivation layer lllf that overlies at least the heater<br>
resistors 56. A gold conductive layer lllg overlies the<br>
tantalum layer lllf.<br>
[0023] The ink barrier layer 12 is formed of a dry film<br>
that is heat and pressure laminated to the thin film<br>
substructure 11 and photodefined to form therein ink<br>
chambers 19 disposed over heater resistors 56 and ink<br>
channels 29. Gold bonding pads 74 engagable for external<br>
electrical connections are formed in the gold layer at<br>
longitudinally spaced apart, opposite ends of the thin film<br>
substructure 11 and are not covered by the ink barrier<br>
layer 12. By way of illustrative example, the barrier<br>
layer material comprises an acrylate based photopolymer dry<br>
film such as the "Parad" brand photopolymer dry film<br>
obtainable from E.I. duPont de Nemours and Company of<br><br>
Wilmington, Delaware. Similar dry films include other<br>
duPont products such as the "Riston" brand dry film and dry<br>
films made by other chemical providers. The orifice plate<br>
13 comprises, for example, a planar substrate comprised of<br>
a polymer material and in which the orifices are formed by<br>
laser ablation, for example as disclosed in commonly<br>
assigned U.S. Patent 5,469,199, incorporated herein by<br>
reference. The orifice plate can also comprise a plated<br>
metal such as nickel.<br>
[0024] As depicted in FIG. 3, the ink chambers 19 in the<br>
ink barrier layer 12 are more particularly disposed over<br>
respective ink firing heater resistors 56, and each ink<br>
chamber 19 is defined by interconnected edges or walls of<br>
a chamber opening formed in the barrier layer 12. The ink<br>
channels 29 are defined by further openings formed in the<br>
barrier layer 12, and are integrally joined to respective<br>
ink firing chambers 19. The ink channels 29 open towards<br>
a feed edge of an adjacent ink feed slot 71 and receive ink<br>
from such ink feed slot.<br>
[0025] The orifice plate 13 includes orifices or nozzles<br>
21 disposed over respective ink chambers 19, such that each<br>
ink firing heater resistor 56, an associated ink chamber<br>
19, and an associated orifice 21 are aligned and form an<br>
ink drop generator 40. Each of the heater resistors has a<br>
nominal resistance of at least 100 ohms, for example about<br>
120 or 130 ohms, and can comprise a segmented resistor as<br>
shown in FIG. 9, wherein a heater resistor 56 is comprised<br>
of two resistor regions 56a, 56b connected by a<br>
metallization region 59. This resistor structure provides<br>
for a resistance that is greater than a single resistor<br>
region of the same area.<br>
[0026] While the disclosed printheads are described as<br>
having a barrier layer and a separate orifice plate, it<br>
should be appreciated that the printheads can be<br><br>
implemented with an integral barrier/orifice structure that<br>
can be made, for example, using a single photopolymer layer<br>
that is exposed with a multiple exposure process and then<br>
developed.<br>
[0027] The ink drop generators 40 are arranged in<br>
columnar arrays or groups 61 that extend along a reference<br>
axis L and are spaced apart from each other laterally or<br>
transversely relative to the reference axis L. The heater<br>
resistors 56 of each ink drop generator group are generally<br>
aligned with the reference axis L and have a predetermined<br>
center to center spacing or nozzle pitch P along the<br>
reference axis L. The nozzle pitch P can be 1/600 inch or<br>
greater, such as 1/300 inch. Each columnar array 61 of ink<br>
drop generators includes for example 100 or more ink drop<br>
generators (i.e., at least 100 ink drop generators).<br>
[0028] By way of illustrative example, the thin film<br>
substructure 11 can be rectangular, wherein opposite edges<br>
51, 52 thereof are longitudinal edges of a length dimension<br>
LS while longitudinally spaced apart, opposite edges 53, 54<br>
are o;: a width or lateral dimension WS that is less than<br>
the length LS of the thin film substructure 11. The<br>
longitudinal extent of the thin film substructure 11 is<br>
along the edges 51, 52 which can be parallel to the<br>
reference axis L. In use, the reference axis L can be<br>
aligned with what is generally referred to as the media<br>
advance axis. For convenience, the longitudinally<br>
separated ends of the thin film substructure will also be<br>
referred to by the reference number 53, 54 used to refer to<br>
the edges at such ends.<br>
[0029] While the ink drop generators 40 of each columnar<br>
array 61 of ink drop generators are illustrated as being<br>
substantially collinear, it should be appreciated that some<br>
of the ink drop generators 40 of an array of ink drop<br><br>
generators can be slightly off the center line of the<br>
column, for example to compensate for firing delays.<br>
[0030] Insofar as each of the ink drop generators 40<br>
includes a heater resistor 56, the heater resistors are<br>
accordingly arranged in columnar groups or arrays that<br>
correspond to the columnar arrays of ink drop generators.<br>
For convenience, the heater resistor arrays or groups will<br>
be referred to by the same reference number 61.<br>
[0031] The thin film substructure 11 of the printhead<br>
100 of FIG. 1-4 more particularly includes two ink feed<br>
slots 71 that are aligned with the reference axis L, and<br>
are spaced apart from each other transversely relative to<br>
the reference axis L. The ink feed slots 71 respectively<br>
feed four columns 61 of ink drop generators respectively<br>
located on opposite sides of the two ink feed slots 71,<br>
wherein the ink channels open towards an edge formed by an<br>
associated ink feed slot in the thin film substructure. In<br>
this manner, opposite edges of each ink feed slot forms a<br>
feed edge and each of the two ink feed slots comprises a<br>
dual edge ink feeding slot. By way of specific<br>
implementation, the printhead 100 of FIGS. 1 - 4 is a<br>
monochrome printhead wherein both ink feed slots 71<br>
provides ink of the same color such as black, such that all<br>
four columns 61 of ink drop generators produce ink drops of<br>
the same color.<br>
[0032] The column pitch or spacing CP between columns on<br>
either side of an ink feed slot is less than or equal to<br>
630 micrometers (µm) (i.e., at most 630 µm) , and the column<br>
pitch or spacing CP" between the columns that are inboard<br>
of the ink feed slots is less than or equal to 800 µm<br>
(i.e., at most 800 µm).<br>
[0033] The nozzle pitch, the stagger or offset of the<br>
nozzles from one column to an adjacent column, along the<br>
reference axis L, and the ink drop volume are more<br><br>
particularly configured to enable a single pass, monochrome<br>
dot spacing along the reference axis L that is l/4th of the<br>
nozzle pitch P which is in the range of 1/300 inch to 1/600<br>
inch. The drop volume can be in the range of 3 to 7<br>
picoliters for dye based inks (as a specific example about<br>
5 picoliters), and in the range of 12 to 19 picoliters of<br>
pigment based inks (as a specific example about 16<br>
picoliters). For a nozzle pitch of 1/300 inch the stagger<br>
or offset along the reference axis L between adjacent<br>
columns of nozzles in a given transverse direction can be<br>
1/1200 inch. In other words, the second column from the<br>
left is offset by 1/1200 inch along a selected direction<br>
along the reference axis L relative to the leftmost column.<br>
The third column from the left is offset by 1/1200 inch<br>
along the selected direction along the reference axis<br>
relative to the second column from the left. The fourth<br>
column from the left is offset by 1/1200 inch along the<br>
selected direction along the reference axis L relative to<br>
the third column from the left.<br>
[0034] Thus, a nozzle pitch P of 1/300 inch would<br>
provide for a single pass dot spacing of 1/1200 inch which<br>
corresponds to a single pass print resolution of 1200 dpi.<br>
A nozzle pitch P of 1/600 inch would provide for a single<br>
pass dot spacing of 1/2400 which corresponds to a single<br>
pass print resolution of 1/2400 dpi.<br>
[0035] More particularly for an implementation having<br>
four columnar arrays 61 each having at least 100 (e.g.,<br>
104) ink drop generators having a nozzle pitch P of 1/300<br>
inch, by way of illustrative example, the length LS of the<br>
thin film substructure 11 can be about 11.65 millimeters,<br>
and the width WS of the thin film substructure can be about<br>
3.29 millimeters or less, such as in the range of about<br>
2.95 millimeters to about 3.29 millimeters. Generally, the<br><br><br>
length/width aspect ratio (i.e., LS/WS) of the thin film<br>
substructure can be greater than 3.5.<br>
[0036] In specific implementations having 100 to 104 ink<br>
drop generators per column, the printhead has a nozzle<br>
packing density in the range of 10.43 nozzles/mm2 to 12.10<br>
nozzles/mm2. More generally, the printhead has a nozzle<br>
packing density of at least 10.43 nozzles/mm2.<br>
[0037] The ink drop generators are each capable of being<br>
driven at a maximum frequency in the range of about 15 kHz<br>
to about 18 kHz by drive circuitry. For example,<br>
respectively adjacent and associated with the columnar<br>
arrays 61 of ink drop generators 40 are columnar FET drive<br>
circuit arrays 81 formed in the thin film substructure 11<br>
of the printhead 100, as schematically depicted in FIG. 6<br>
for a representative columnar array 61 of ink drop<br>
generators. Each FET drive circuit array 81 includes a<br>
plurality of FET drive circuits 85 having drain electrodes<br>
respectively connected to respective heater resistors 56 by<br>
heater resistor leads 57a. Associated with each FET drive<br>
circuit array 81 and the associated, array of ink drop<br>
generators is a columnar ground bus 181 to which the source<br>
electrodes of all of the FET drive circuits 85 of the<br>
associated FET drive circuit array 81 are electrically<br>
connected. Each columnar array 81 of FET drive circuits<br>
and the associated ground bus 181 extend longitudinally<br>
along the associated columnar array 61 of ink drop<br>
generators, and are at least longitudinally co-extensive<br>
with the associated columnar array 61. Each ground bus 181<br>
is electrically connected to at least one bond pad 74 at<br>
one end of the printhead structure and to at least one bond<br>
pad 7 4 at the other end of the printhead structure as<br>
schematically depicted in FIGS. 1 and 2.<br>
[0038] The ground busses 181 and heater resistor leads<br>
57a are formed in the metallization layer 111c (FIG. 5) of<br>
the thin film substructure 11, as are the heater resistor<br>
leads 57b, and the drain and source electrodes of the FET<br>
drive circuits 85 described further herein.<br>
[0039] The FET drive circuits 85 of each columnar array<br>
of FET drive circuits are controlled by an associated<br>
columnar array 31 of decoder logic circuits 35 that decode<br>
address information on an adjacent address bus 33 that is<br>
connected to appropriate bond pads 74 (FIG. 6) . The<br>
address information identifies the ink drop generators that<br>
are to be energized with ink firing energy, as discussed<br>
further herein, and is utilized by the decoder logic<br>
circuits 35 to turn on the FET drive circuit of an<br>
addressed or selected ink drop generator.<br>
[0040] As schematically depicted in FIG. 7, one terminal<br>
of each heater resistor 56 is connected via a primitive<br>
select trace to a bond pad 74 that receives an ink firing<br>
primitive select signal PS. In this manner, since the<br>
other terminal of each heater resistor 56 is connected to<br>
the drain terminal of an associated FET drive circuit 85,<br>
ink firing energy PS is provided to the heater resistor 56<br>
if the associated FET drive circuit is ON as controlled by<br>
the associated decoder logic circuit 35.<br>
[0041] As schematically depicted in FIG. 8 for a<br>
representative columnar array 61 of ink drop generators,<br>
the ink drop generators of a columnar array 61 of ink drop<br>
generators can be organized into four primitive groups 61a,<br>
61b, 61c, 61d of contiguously adjacent ink drop generators,<br>
and the heater resistors 56 of a particular primitive group<br>
are electrically connected to the same one of four<br>
primitive select traces 86a, 86b, 86c,. 86d, such that the<br>
ink drop generators of a particular primitive group are<br>
switchably coupled in parallel to the same ink firing<br>
primitive select signal PS. For the specific example<br>
wherein the number N of ink drop generators in a columnar<br>
array is an integral multiple of 4, each primitive group<br>
includes N/4 ink drop generators. For reference, the<br>
primitive groups 61a, 61b, 61c, 61d are arranged in<br>
sequence from the lateral edge 53 toward the lateral edge<br>
54.<br>
[0042] FIG. 8 more particularly sets forth a schematic<br>
top plan view of primitive select traces 86a, 86b, 86c, 86d<br>
for an associated columnar array 61 of drop generators and<br>
an associated columnar array 81 of FET drive circuits 85<br>
(FIG. 6) as implemented for example by traces in the gold<br>
metallization layer lllg (FIG. 5) that is above and<br>
dielectrically separated from the associated array 81 of<br>
FET drive circuit and ground bus 181. The primitive select<br>
traces 86a, 86b, 86c, 86d are respectively electrically<br>
connected to the four primitive groups 61a, 61b, 61c, 61d<br>
by resistor leads 57b (FIG. 8) formed in the metallization<br>
layer 111c and interconnecting vias 58 (FIG. 8) that extend<br>
between the primitive select traces and the resistor leads<br>
57b.<br>
[0043] The first primitive select trace 86a extends<br>
longitudinally along the first primitive group 61a and<br>
overlies a portion of heater resistor leads 57b (FIG. 9)<br>
that are respectively connected to heater resistors 56 of<br>
the first primitive group 61a, and is connected by vias 58<br>
(FIG. 9) to such heater resistor leads 57b. The second<br>
primitive select trace 86b includes a section that extends<br>
along the second primitive group 61b and overlies a portion<br>
of heater resistor leads 57b (FIG. 9) that are respectively<br>
connected to heater resistors 56 of the second primitive<br>
group 61b, and is connected by vias 58 to such heater<br>
resistor leads 57b. The second trace 86b includes a<br>
further section that extends along the first primitive<br>
select trace 86a on the side of the first primitive select<br>
trace 86a that is opposite the heater resistors 56 of the<br>
first primitive group 61a. The second primitive select<br>
trace 8 6b is generally L-shaped wherein the second section<br>
is narrower than the first section so as to bypass the<br>
first primitive select trace 86a which is narrower than the<br>
wider section of the second primitive select trace 8 6b.<br>
[0044] The first and second primitive select traces 86a,<br>
86b are generally at least coextensive longitudinally with<br>
the first and second primitive groups 61a, 61b, and are<br>
respectively appropriately connected to respective bond<br>
pads 74 disposed at the lateral edge 53 which is closest to<br>
the first and second primitive select traces 86a, 86b.<br>
[0045] The fourth primitive select trace 86d extends<br>
longitudinally along the fourth primitive group 61d and<br>
overlies a portion of heater resistor leads 57b (FIG. 9)<br>
that are connected to heater resistors 56 of the fourth<br>
primitive group 61d, and is connected by vias 58 to such<br>
heater resistor leads 57b. The third primitive select<br>
trace 86c includes a section that extends along the third<br>
primitive group 61c and overlies a portion of heater<br>
resistor leads 57b (FIG. 9) that are connected to heater<br>
resistors 56 of the third primitive group 61c, and is<br>
connected by vias 58 to such heater resistor leads 57b.<br>
The third primitive select trace 86c includes a further<br>
section that extends along the fourth primitive select<br>
trace 86d. The third primitive select trace 86c is<br>
generally L-shaped wherein the second section is narrower<br>
than the first section so as to bypass the fourth primitive<br>
select trace 86d which is narrower than the wider section<br>
of the third primitive select trace 86c.<br>
[0046] The third and fourth primitive select traces 86c,<br>
8 6d are generally at least coextensive longitudinally with<br>
the third and fourth primitive groups 61c, 61d, and are<br>
respectively appropriately connected to respective bond<br>
pads 74 disposed at the lateral edge 54 that is closest to<br>
the third and fourth primitive select traces 86c, 86d.<br>
[0047] By way of specific example, the primitive select<br>
traces 86a, 86b, 86c, 86d for a columnar array 61 of ink<br>
drop generators overlie the FET drive circuits and the<br>
ground bus associated with the columnar array of ink drop<br>
generators, and are contained in a region that is<br>
longitudinally coextensive with the associated columnar<br>
array 61. In this manner, four primitive select traces for<br>
the four primitives of a columnar array 61 of ink drop<br>
generators extend along the array toward the ends of the<br>
printhead substrate. More particularly, a first pair of<br>
primitive select traces for a first pair of primitive<br>
groups 61a, 61b disposed in one-half of the length of the<br>
printhead substrate are contained in a region that extends<br>
along such first pair of primitive groups, while a second<br>
pair of primitive select traces for a second pair of<br>
primitive groups 61c, 61d disposed in the other half of the<br>
length of the printhead substrate are contained in a region<br>
that extends along such second pair of primitive groups.<br>
[0048] For ease of reference, the primitive select<br>
traces 86 and the associated ground bus that electrically<br>
connect the heater resistors 56 and associated FET drive<br>
circuits 85 to bond pads 74 are collectively referred to as<br>
power traces. Also for ease of reference, the primitive<br>
select traces 86 can be referred to as to the high side or<br>
non-grounded power traces.<br>
[0049] Generally, the parasitic resistance (or on-<br>
resistance) of each of the FET drive circuits 85 is<br>
configured to compensate for the variation in the parasitic<br>
resistance presented to the different FET drive circuits 85<br>
by the parasitic path formed by the power traces, so as to<br>
reduce the variation in the energy provided to the heater<br>
resistors. In particular, the pcwer traces form a<br>
parasitic path that presents a parasitic resistance to the<br>
FET circuits that varies with location on the path, and the<br>
parasitic resistance of each of the FET drive circuits 85<br>
is selected so that the combination of the parasitic<br>
resistance of each FET drive circuit 85 and the parasitic<br>
resistance of the power traces as presented to the FET<br>
drive circuit varies only slightly from one ink drop<br>
generator to another. Insofar as the heater resistors 56<br>
are all of substantially the same resistance, the parasitic<br>
resistance of each FET drive circuit 85 is thus configured<br>
to compensate for the variation of the parasitic resistance<br>
of the associated power traces as presented to the<br>
different FET drive circuits 85. In this manner, to the<br>
extent that substantially equal energies are provided to<br>
the bond pads connected to the power traces, substantially<br>
equal energies can be provided to the different heater<br>
resistors 56.<br>
[0050] Referring more particularly to FIGS. 9 and 10,<br>
each of the FET drive circuits 85 comprises a plurality of<br>
electrically interconnected drain electrode fingers 87<br>
disposed over drain region fingers 8 9 formed in the silicon<br>
substrate 111a (FIG. 5), and a plurality of electrically<br>
interconnected source electrode fingers 97 interdigitated<br>
or interleaved with the drain electrodes 87 and disposed<br>
over source region fingers 99 formed in the silicon<br>
substrate 111a. Polysilicon gate fingers 91 that are<br>
interconnected at respective ends are disposed on a thin<br>
gate oxide layer 93 formed on the silicon substrate 111a.<br>
A phosphosilicate glass layer 95 separates the drain<br>
electrodes 87 and the source electrodes 97 from the silicon<br>
substrate 111a. A plurality of conductive drain contacts<br>
88 electrically connect the drain electrodes 87 to the<br>
drain regions 89, while a plurality of conductive source<br>
contacts 98 electrically connect the source electrodes 97<br>
to the source regions 99.<br>
[0051] The area occupied by each FET drive circuit is<br>
preferably small, and the on-resistance of each FET drive<br>
circuit is preferrably low, for example less than or equal<br>
to 14 or 16 ohms (i.e., at most 14 or 16 ohms), which<br>
requires efficient FET drive circuits. For example, the<br>
on-resistance Ron can be related to FET drive circuit area<br>
A as follows:<br>
Ron 
wherein the area A is in micrometers2 (um2) . This can be<br>
accomplished for example with a gate oxide layer 93 having<br>
a thickness that is less than or equal to 800 Angstroms<br>
(i.e., at most 800 Angstroms), or a gate length that is<br>
less than 4 µm. Also, having a heater resistor resistance<br>
of at least 100 ohms allows the FET circuits to be made<br>
smaller than if the heater resistors had a lower<br>
resistance, since with a greater heater resistor value a<br>
greater FET turn-on resistance can be tolerated from a<br>
consideration of distribution of energy between parasitics<br>
and the heater resistors.<br>
[0052] As a particular example, the drain electrodes 87,<br>
drain regions 89, source electrodes 97, source regions 99,<br>
and the polysilicon gate fingers 91 can extend<br>
substantially orthogonally or transversely to the reference<br>
axis L and to the longitudinal extent of the ground busses<br>
181. Also, for each FET circuit 85, the extent of the<br>
drain regions 89 and the source regions 99 transversely to<br>
the reference axis L is the same as extent of the gate<br>
fingers transversely to the reference axis L, as shown in<br>
FIG. 6, which defines the extent of the active regions<br>
transversely to the reference axis L. For ease of<br>
reference, the extent of the drain electrode fingers 87,<br>
drain region fingers 89, source electrode fingers 97,<br>
source region fingers 99, and polysilicon gate fingers 91<br>
can be referred to as the longitudinal extent of such<br>
elements insofar as such elements are long and narrow in a<br>
strip-like or finger-like manner.<br>
[0053] By way of illustrative example, the on-resistance<br>
of each of the FET circuits 85 is individually configured<br>
by controlling the longitudinal extent or length of a<br>
continuously non-contacted segment of the drain region<br>
fingers, wherein a continuously non-contacted segment is<br>
devoid of electrical contacts 88. For example, the<br>
continuously non-contacted segments of the drain region<br>
fingers can begin at the ends of the drain regions 89 that<br>
are furthest from the heater resistor 56. The on-<br>
resistance of a particular FET circuit 85 increases with<br>
increasing length of the continuously non-contacted drain<br>
region finger segment, and such length is selected to<br>
determine the on-resistance of a particular FET circuit.<br>
[0054] As another example, the on-resistance of each FET<br>
circuit 85 can be configured by selecting the size of the<br>
FET circuit. For example, the extent of an FET circuit<br>
transversely to the reference axis L can be selected to<br>
define the on-resistance.<br>
[0055] For a typical implementation wherein the power<br>
traces for a particular FET circuit 85 are routed by<br>
reasonably direct paths to bond pads 74 on the closest of<br>
the longitudinally separated ends of the printhead<br>
structure, parasitic resistance increases with distance<br>
from the closest end of the printhead, and the on-<br>
resistance of the FET drive circuits 85 is decreased<br>
(making an FET circuit more efficient) with distance from<br>
such closest end, so as to offset the increase in power<br>
trace parasitic resistance. As a specific example, as to<br>
continuously non-contacted drain finger segments of the<br>
respective FET drive circuits 85 that start at the ends of<br>
the drain region fingers that are furthest from the heater<br>
resistors 56, the lengths of such segments are decreased<br>
with distance from the closest one of the longitudinally<br>
separated ends of the printhead structure.<br>
[0056] Each ground bus 181 is formed of the same thin<br>
film metallization layer as the drain electrodes 87 and the<br>
source electrodes 97 of the FET circuits 85, and the active<br>
areas of each of the FET circuits comprised of the source<br>
and drain regions 89, 99 and the polysilicon gates 91<br>
advantageously extend beneath an associated ground bus 181.<br>
This allows the ground bus and FET circuit arrays to<br>
occupy narrower regions which in turn allows for a<br>
narrower, and thus less costly, thin film substructure.<br>
[0057] Also, in an implementation wherein the<br>
continuously non-contacted segments of the drain region<br>
fingers start at the ends of the drain region fingers that<br>
are furthest from the heater resistors 56, the extent of<br>
each ground bus 181 transversely or laterally to the<br>
reference axis L and toward the associated heater resistors<br>
56 can be increased as the length of the continuously non-<br>
contacted drain finger sections is increased, since the<br>
drain electrodes do not need to extend over such<br>
continuously non-contacted drain finger sections. In other<br>
words, the width W of a ground bus 181 can be increased by<br>
increasing the amount by which the ground bus overlies the<br>
active regions of the FET drive circuits 85, depending upon<br>
the length of the continuously non-contacted drain region<br>
segments. This is achieved without increasing the width of<br>
the region occupied by a ground bus 181 and its associated<br>
FET drive circuit array 81 since the increase is achieved<br>
by increasing the amount of overlap between the ground bus<br>
and the active regions of the FET drive circuits 85.<br>
Effectively, at any particular FET circuit 85, the ground<br>
bus can overlap the active region transversely to the<br>
reference axis L by substantially the length of the non-<br>
contacted segments of the drain regions.<br>
[0058] For the specific example wherein the continuously<br>
non-contacted drain region segments start at the ends of<br>
the drain region fingers that are furthest from the heater<br>
resistors 56 and wherein the lengths of such continuously<br>
non-contacted drain region segments decrease with distance<br>
from the closest end of the printhead structure, the<br>
modulation or variation of the width W of a ground bus 181<br>
with the variation of the length of the continuously non-<br>
contacted drain region segments provides for a ground bus<br>
having a width W181 that increases wizh proximity to the<br>
closest end of the printhead structure, as depicted in FIG.<br>
8. Since the amount of shared currents increases with<br>
proximity to the bonds pads 74, such shape advantageously<br>
provides for decreased ground bus resistance with proximity<br>
to the bond pads 74.<br>
[0059] Ground bus resistance can also be reduced by<br>
laterally extending portions of the ground bus 181 into<br>
longitudinally spaced apart areas between the decoder logic<br>
circuits 35. For example, such portions can extend<br>
laterally beyond the active regions by the width of the<br>
region in which the decoder logic circuits 35 are formed.<br>
[0060] The following circuitry portions associated with<br>
a columnar array of ink drop generators can be contained in<br>
respective regions having the following widths that are<br>
indicated in FIGS. 6 and 8 by the reference designations<br>
that follow the width values.<br>
These widths are measured orthogonally or laterally to the<br>
longitudinal extent of the printhead substrate which is<br>
aligned with the reference axis L.<br>
[0061] Referring now to FIG. 11, set forth therein is a<br>
schematic perspective view of an example of an ink jet<br>
printing device 20 in which the above described printheads<br>
can be employed. The ink jet printing device 20 of FIG. 11<br>
includes a chassis 122 surrounded by a housing or enclosure<br>
124, typically of a molded plastic material. The chassis<br>
122 is formed for example of sheet metal and includes a<br>
vertical panel 122a. Sheets of print media are<br>
individually fed through a print zone 125 by an adaptive<br>
print media handling system 12 6 that includes a feed tray<br>
128 for storing print media before printing. The print<br>
media may be any type of suitable printable sheet material<br>
such as paper, card-stock, transparencies, Mylar, and the<br>
like, but for convenience the illustrated embodiments<br>
described as using paper as the print medium. A series of<br>
conventional motor-driven rollers including a drive roller<br>
12 9 driven by a stepper motor may be used to move print<br>
media from the feed tray 128 into the print zone 125.<br>
After printing, the drive roller 129 drives the printed<br>
sheet onto a pair of retractable output drying wing members<br>
130 which are shown extended to receive a printed sheet.<br>
The wing members 130 hold the newly printed sheet for a<br>
short time above any previously printed sheets still drying<br>
in an output tray 132 before pivotally retracting to the<br>
sides, as shown by curved arrows 133, to drop the newly<br>
printed sheet into the output tray 132. The print media<br>
handling system may include a series of adjustment<br>
mechanisms for accommodating different sizes of print<br>
media, including letter, legal, A-4, envelopes, etc., such<br>
as a sliding length adjustment arm 134 and an envelope feed<br>
slot 135.<br>
[0062] The printer of FIG. 11 further includes a printer<br>
controller 136, schematically illustrated as a<br>
microprocessor, disposed on a printed circuit board 139<br>
supported on the rear side of the chassis vertical panel<br>
122a. The printer controller 136 receives instructions<br>
from a host device such as a personal computer (not shown)<br>
and controls the operation of the printer including advance<br>
of print media through the print zone 125, movement of a<br>
print carriage 140, and application of signals to the ink<br>
drop generators 40.<br>
[0063] A print carriage slider rod 138 having a<br>
longitudinal axis parallel to a carriage scan axis is<br>
supported by the chassis 122 to sizeably support a print<br>
carriage 140 for reciprocating translational movement or<br>
scanning along the carriage scan axis. The print carriage<br>
140 supports first and second removable ink jet printhead<br>
cartridges 150, 152 (each of which is sometimes called a<br>
"pen," "print cartridge," or "cartridge"). The print<br>
cartridges 150, 152 include respective printheads 154, 156<br>
that respectively have generally downwardly facing nozzles<br>
for ejecting ink generally downwardly onto a portion of the<br>
print media that is in the print zone 125. The print<br>
cartridges 150, 152 are more particularly clamped in the<br>
print carriage 140 by a latch mechanism that includes<br>
clamping levers, latch members or lids 170, 172.<br>
[0064] For reference, print media is advanced through<br>
the print zone 125 along a media axis which is parallel to<br>
the tangent to the portion of the print media that is<br>
beneath and traversed by the nozzles of the cartridges 150,<br>
152. If the media axis and the carriage axis are located<br>
on the same plane, as shown in FIG. 9, they would be<br>
perpendicular to each other.<br>
[0065] An anti-rotation mechanism on the back of the<br>
print carriage engages a horizontally disposed anti-pivot<br>
bar 185 that is formed integrally with the vertical panel<br>
122a of the chassis 122, for example, to prevent forward<br>
pivoting of the print carriage 140 about the slider rod<br>
138.<br>
[0066] By way of illustrative example, the print<br>
cartridge 150 is a monochrome printing cartridge while the<br>
print cartridge 152 is a tri-color printing cartridge.<br>
[0067] The print carriage 140 is driven along the slider<br>
rod 138 by an endless belt 158 which can be driven in a<br>
conventional manner, and a linear encoder strip 159 is<br>
utilized to detect position of the print carriage 140 along<br>
the carriage scan axis, for example in accordance with<br>
conventional techniques.<br>
[0068] Although the foregoing has been a description and<br>
illustration of specific embodiments of the invention,<br>
