				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The invention relates to a method for producing a catalyst, wherein<br>
the catalyst has a high activity and selectivity with regard to<br>
the oxidation of CO and NO. The invention also relates to the<br>
catalyst produced using the method according to the invention, the<br>
use of the catalyst as oxidation catalyst as well as a catalyst<br>
component which contains the catalyst according to the invention.<br>
Finally, the invention is directed towards an exhaust-gas cleaning<br>
system which comprises the catalyst component containing the<br>
catalyst according to the invention.<br>
In the early stages of exhaust-gas cleaning of combustion engines,<br>
only the exhaust gases from petrol engines were cleaned with<br>
three-way catalysts (TWC). The nitrogen oxides are reduced with<br>
the reductive hydrocarbons (HC) and carbon monoxide (CO). For this,<br>
the petrol engine is always driven under approximately<br>
stoichiometric conditions {X=l). This cannot always be guaranteed<br>
precisely in this way, with the result that the conditions in the<br>
exhaust gas always fluctuate around A,= l. In other words, the<br>
catalyst is exposed alternately to an oxidative or a reductive gas<br>
atmosphere.<br>
For about 15 years, attempts have also been made to aftertreat the<br>
exhaust gases from diesel engines with catalysts. The exhaust gas<br>
from diesel engines contains carbon monoxide, unburnt hydrocarbons,<br>
nitrogen oxides and soot particles as air pollutants. The unburnt<br>
hydrocarbons comprise paraffins, olefins, aldehydes and aromatics.<br>
Unlike the petrol engine, the diesel engine always runs with an<br>
excess of oxygen. The result of this is that the catalyst is never<br>
exposed to reductive conditions. This has the following<br>
consequences:<br>
1. The oxygen storage capacity of the catalyst material does not<br>
play the same role as with the TWC.<br>
2. The noble metal particles are not always reduced again to<br>
metal of oxidation state 0.<br>
3. The nitrogen oxides cannot be fully reduced when there is an<br>
excess of oxygen with the hydrocarbons (HC) present in the<br>
exhaust gas and CO.<br>
4. The hydrocarbons and CO can be oxidized both with oxygen and<br>
with NOx.<br>
Diesel exhaust gases are much colder than exhaust gases from petrol<br>
engines and contain oxygen in a concentration between 3 and 10<br>
vol.-%, which is why the catalytic activity of the catalyst on<br>
average is not always sufficient to oxidize HC and CO. In<br>
partial-load operation, the exhaust-gas temperature of a diesel<br>
engine lies in the range between 100 and 250°C and only in full-load<br>
operation does it reach a maximum temperature between 550 and 650°C.<br>
In contrast, the exhaust-gas temperature of a petrol engine lies<br>
between 400 and 450°C in partial-load operation and, in full load,<br>
can rise to up to 1000°C. It is therefore an aim to achieve as low<br>
as possible a CO light-off temperature.<br>
In past years, diesel particle filters (DPF) have increasingly been<br>
introduced onto the market. These are normally fitted downstream<br>
of the DOCs. Soot is collected and oxidized in the DPF. The<br>
oxidation of soot is much more possible with NO2 than with oxygen.<br>
Thus, the more N02 is contained in the gas stream after the DOC,<br>
the more soot continuously reacts. Thus, there has been a tendency<br>
in past years to oxidize as much NO to N02 as possible in the DOC.<br>
But N02 is an even more toxic gas than NO, with the result that<br>
this shift towards increased nitrogen oxide emissions manifests<br>
itself in a very negative way. An increasing NO2 concentration due<br>
to DOC is also already detectable in cities. Thus, the trend is<br>
returning to a limiting of the oxidation of NO to NO2.<br>
Markedly reduced emissions of nitrogen oxides have thus also been<br>
prescribed for the Euro VI standard. It will be possible to achieve<br>
these either only by means of NOx-trap catalysts or by means of<br>
a selective catalytic reduction by means of ammonia. The closer<br>
the NO/NO2 ratio is to 1:1, the more efficiently such an SCR<br>
reaction runs, thus a substantial oxidation of NO to NO2 is<br>
desirable for this. This should, however, be achieved with<br>
continuingly very good oxidation of CO and hydrocarbons HC.<br>
SCR (selective catalytic reduction) denotes the selective<br>
catalytic reduction of nitrogen oxides from exhaust gases of<br>
combustion engines and also power stations. Only the nitrogen<br>
oxides NO and NO2 (called N0X in general) are selectively reduced<br>
with an SCR catalyst, wherein NH3 (ammonia) is usually admixed for<br>
the reaction. Only the harmless substances water and nitrogen thus<br>
form as reaction product. The transportation of ammonia in<br>
compressed-gas bottles is a safety risk for use in motor vehicles.<br>
Therefore precursor compounds of ammonia which are broken down in<br>
the exhaust-gas system of the vehicles accompanied by the formation<br>
of ammonia are customarily used. For example the use of AdBlue®,<br>
which is an approximately 32.5% eutectic solution of urea in water,<br>
is known in this connection. Other ammonia sources are for example<br>
ammonium carbamate, ammonium formate or urea pellets.<br>
Ammonia must first be formed from urea before the actual SCR<br>
reaction. This occurs in two reaction steps which together are<br>
called hydrolysis reaction. Firstly, NH3 and isocyanic acid are<br>
formed in a thermolysis reaction. In the actual hydrolysis reaction<br>
isocyanic acid is then reacted with water to ammonia and carbon<br>
dioxide.<br>
To avoid solid depositions it is necessary for the second reaction<br>
to take place sufficiently quickly by choosing suitable catalysts<br>
and sufficiently high temperatures (from 250°C). Simultaneously,<br>
modern SCR reactors act as the hydrolysis catalyst.<br>
The ammonia formed through thermohydrolysis reacts at the SCR<br>
catalyst according to the following equations:<br>
4N0 + 4NH3 + 02 -* 4N2 + 6H20 (1)<br>
NO + N02 + 2NH3 -»¦ 2N2 + 3H20 (2)<br>
6N02 + 8NH3 -» 7N2 + 12H20 (3)<br>
At low temperatures (
via reaction (2). For a good low-temperature conversion it is<br>
therefore necessary to set an N02:NO ratio of approximately 1:1.<br>
Under these conditions the reaction (2) can already take place at<br>
temperatures from 170-200°C.<br>
The oxidation of NO to N0X takes place according to the invention<br>
in an upstream oxidation catalyst which is necessary for an optimum<br>
degree of efficiency.<br>
The basis of the catalytic exhaust-gas cleaning in a diesel engine<br>
is thus clearly the upstream oxidation catalyst which is to have<br>
an efficient oxidation action for CO, HC and NO. This is achieved<br>
for example by reducing the CO light-off temperature.<br>
In the publication SAE 2005/01-0476 (Rhodia), it is clear that<br>
above all support materials with smaller interactions with Pt (II) ,<br>
e.g. aluminium oxide and zirconium oxide, make possible very low<br>
light-off temperatures for the oxidation of CO. Because of the<br>
larger BET surface area of aluminium, aluminium oxide is preferably<br>
used for DOC applications.<br>
One way of reducing the light-off temperature for CO as much as<br>
possible can be found in the patent application EP 706817 from<br>
Umicore. EP 706817 describes a DOC catalyst with .Pt on an Al/Si<br>
mixed oxide (in the best case 5% Si) .<br>
The further development using an H+ and Na+ zeolite is disclosed<br>
in EP 800856 Bl, where light-off temperatures of approximately<br>
150°C for CO are already achieved.<br>
A further improvement is described in EP 1129764 Bl, where very<br>
finely distributed Pt particles with an average oxidation state<br>
of the Pt 
It is to be borne in mind that combustion exhaust gases can contain<br>
a wide variety of components, such as CO, nitrogen oxides and<br>
residual hydrocarbons. In addition, combustion exhaust gases can<br>
also contain different quantities'of oxygen depending on the<br>
guidance of the combustion. The gas mixture can thus be reductive<br>
or oxidative. In this case, it is not absolutely clear.<br>
Although the injection of a platinum precursor into a flame results<br>
in a catalyst that has a good activity with regard to a CO oxidation,<br>
the oxidation activity with regard to the oxidation of NO to NO2<br>
cannot be controlled with this method. Thus, there is still a need<br>
for catalysts with as low as possible a light-off temperature for<br>
CO and, at the same time, a high activity and selectivity for the<br>
oxidation of NO to N02.<br>
The object of the present invention was therefore to provide such<br>
catalysts.<br>
The object is achieved by a method for producing a catalyst,<br>
comprising the steps:<br>
(a) impregnating a support material with a platinum compound,<br>
(b) drying the impregnated support material below the<br>
decomposition point of the platinum compound,<br>
(c) calcining the impregnated support material in a gas stream<br>
which contains NO and inert gas.<br>
N2, He, Ne or Ar is preferably used as inert gas, particularly<br>
preferably N2.<br>
The gas stream preferably contains 0.5 to 3 vol.-% NO, particularly<br>
preferably 1 vol.-% NO, relative to the total volume of the gas<br>
stream. Accordingly, the gas stream preferably contains 97 to 99.5<br>
vol.-% inert gas, in particular N2, particularly preferably 99<br>
vol.-% inert gas, relative to the total volume of the gas stream.<br>
It was surprisingly found that heating a support material<br>
impregnated with a platinum compound in a gas stream that<br>
predominantly contains inert gas, in particular N2, and too small<br>
proportions of NO results in a catalyst that displays a high<br>
activity for the oxidation of CO to C02, but at the, same time also<br>
has a very high activity and selectivity with regard to the<br>
oxidation of NO to N02. This behaviour is very desirable in<br>
particular for a use as diesel oxidation catalyst (DOC) followed<br>
by SCR (selective catalytic reduction) or followed by DPF (diesel<br>
particle filter) and SCR.<br>
Particularly preferably, the calcining (first calcining) of the<br>
impregnated support material takes place heating within 10 minutes,<br>
particularly preferably within 6 minutes and quite particularly<br>
preferably within 5 minutes. The calcining temperature is<br>
preferably 400°C to 650°C, particularly preferably 450°C to 600°C.<br>
A further (second) calcining then takes place, optionally after<br>
a short pause, over a period of 10 - 40 min, preferably 20 min,<br>
under the same conditions.<br>
According to the invention, it is advantageous if the dried,<br>
impregnated support material is present as a thin'layer or finely<br>
distributed, as this guarantees that the thermal energy can be<br>
optimally utilized during the calcining and thus a complete<br>
calcining can take place during the short time period of less than<br>
10 minutes.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the dried, impregnated<br>
support material is therefore applied to a catalyst support body<br>
prior to the calcining. Particularly preferably, the dried,<br>
impregnated support material is applied to the catalyst support<br>
body in the form of a washcoat coating and then dried again below<br>
the decomposition temperature of the platinum compound.<br>
The drying of the impregnated support material takes place<br>
according to the present invention preferably at temperatures of<br>
from 60°C to 100°C, more preferably from 70 to 90°C, most preferably<br>
at 80°C. However, the temperature depends on the platinum compound<br>
used, as these can have different decomposition points and thus<br>
the temperature must be adapted accordingly. The drying preferably<br>
takes place under reduced pressure, particularly preferably under<br>
fine vacuum.<br>
For the impregnating, the noble metal (Pt) is usually present as<br>
salt solution, for example as chloride, nitrate or sulphate.<br>
Normally, all customary salts and complex salts of platinum are<br>
suitable, e.g. hexachloroplatinic acid, tetrachloroplatinic acid,<br>
dinitro diamine platinate (II), tetraamine platinum (II) chloride,<br>
ammonium tetrachloroplatinate (II), ammonium hexachloroplatinate<br>
(IV), dichloro(ethylenediamine) platinum, tetraamine platinum<br>
(II) nitrate, tetraamine platinum (II) hydroxide,<br>
methylethanolamine platinum (II) hydroxide, platinum nitrate,<br>
ethanolammonium hexahydroxoplatinate (platinum ethanolamine,<br>
PtEA) and similar.<br>
A metal oxide is preferably used as support material. The metal<br>
oxide is preferably selected from the group consisting of aluminium<br>
oxide, silicon oxide, aluminosilicate, zirconium oxide, titanium<br>
oxide, Al/Si mixed oxide or combinations thereof.<br>
The necessary coating techniques for coating a catalyst support<br>
body are known to a person skilled in the art. Thus, e.g. the<br>
impregnated and dried metal oxide or mixed oxide is processed to<br>
an aqueous coating dispersion. This dispersion can be added as<br>
binder, e.g. silica sol. The viscosity of the dispersion can be<br>
set by the appropriate additives, with the result that it becomes<br>
possible to apply the necessary quantity of coating to the walls<br>
of the flow channels in a single work step. If this is not possible,<br>
the coating can be repeated several times, wherein each freshly<br>
applied coating is fixed by an intermediate drying. The finished<br>
coating is then calcined at the temperatures given above within<br>
the temperature range in less than 10 min, preferably less than<br>
6 min, particularly preferably less than 5 min (first calcining).<br>
A second calcining step then takes place, optionally after a short<br>
pause, over a period of 10 - 40 min, preferably 20 min, under the<br>
same conditions.<br>
For the exhaust-gas cleaning of diesel engines, coating quantities<br>
of from 50 to 500 g/1 volume of the catalyst support body are<br>
advantageous. The catalyst component is preferably matched such<br>
that the catalytically active components are present in the metal<br>
oxide in a concentration of from approximately 0.01 to 7 g/1,<br>
preferably 2-4 g/1 of the honeycomb body.<br>
A metallic or ceramic monolith, a non-woven or metal foam can be<br>
used as catalyst support body. Other catalyst shaped bodies or<br>
catalyst support bodies known in the state of the art are also<br>
suitable according to the invention. A metallic or ceramic monolith<br>
that has a plurality of parallel passage openings which are<br>
provided with the washcoat coating is particularly preferred. With<br>
this, a uniform and in particular thin application of the washcoat<br>
suspension can be guaranteed, which thus supports the calcining.<br>
Metallic honeycomb bodies are often formed from sheet metals or<br>
metal foils. The honeycomb bodies are produced for example by<br>
alternating arrangement of layers of structured sheets or foils.<br>
Preferably, these arrangements consist of one layer of "a smooth<br>
sheet alternating with a corrugated sheet, wherein the corrugation<br>
can be formed for example sinusoidal, trapezoidal, omega-shaped<br>
or zigzag-shaped. Suitable metallic honeycomb bodies and methods<br>
for their production are described for example in EP 0 049 489 Al<br>
or DE 28 56 030 Al.<br>
In the field of catalyst support bodies, metallic honeycomb bodies<br>
have the advantage that they heat up more quickly and thus catalyst<br>
support bodies based on metallic substrates normally display a<br>
better response behaviour in cold-start conditions.<br>
The honeycomb body preferably has a cell density of from 200 to<br>
600 cpsi, in particular 400 cpsi.<br>
The catalyst support body to which the catalyst according to the<br>
invention can be applied can be formed from any metal or a metal<br>
alloy and be produced e.g. by extrusion or by coiling or stacking<br>
or folding of metal foils. In the field of exhaust-gas cleaning,<br>
temperature-resistant alloys with the main constituents iron,<br>
chromium and aluminium are known. Monolithic catalyst support<br>
bodies that can be freely flowed through with or without internal<br>
leading edges for the agitation of the exhaust gas or metal foams<br>
which have a large internal surface area and to which the catalyst<br>
according to the invention adheres very well are preferred for the<br>
catalyst according to the invention. However, catalyst support<br>
bodies with slits, holes, perforations and impressions in the metal<br>
foil can also be used.<br>
In the same way, catalyst support bodies made of ceramic material<br>
can be used. Preferably, the ceramic material is an-inert material<br>
with a small surface area, such as cordierite, mullite or<br>
a-aluminium oxide. However, the catalyst support used can also<br>
consist of support material with a large surface area, such as<br>
Y-aluminium oxide.<br>
A metal foam, for example a metallic open-pored foam material, can<br>
also be used as catalyst support body. Within the framework of the<br>
present invention, by the term "metallic open-pored foam material"<br>
is meant a foam material made of any metal or of any alloy which<br>
can optionally also contain additives and which has a plurality<br>
of pores which are connected to each other by conduit, with the<br>
result that for example a gas can be conducted through the foam<br>
material.<br>
Metallic open-pored foam materials have a very low density because<br>
of the pores and cavities, but have a substantial stiffness and<br>
strength. The production of metal foams takes place for example<br>
by means of a metal powder and a metal hydride. Both powders are<br>
normally admixed together and then compacted to a shaped material<br>
by hot pressing or extrusion. The shaped material is then heated<br>
to a temperature above the melting point of the metals. The metal<br>
hydride releases hydrogen gas and the mixture foams.<br>
However, there are also still other possibilities for producing<br>
metal foams, for example by blowing gas into a metal melt which<br>
has previously been made foamable by adding solid constituents.<br>
For aluminium alloys for example, 10 to 20 vol.-% silicon carbide<br>
or aluminium oxide is added for the stabilization. In addition,<br>
open-pored metallic foam structures with a pore diameter of from<br>
10 ppi to approximately 50 ppi can be produced by special precision<br>
casting techniques.<br>
A further subject of the invention is a catalyst which can be<br>
obtained using the method according to the invention. The catalyst<br>
is characterized by a very good activity and a selective oxidation<br>
potential for an oxidation of CO and NO. The catalyst also displays<br>
very good conversion rates for HC.<br>
The catalyst can accordingly be used as oxidation catalyst. In<br>
particular, the oxidation catalyst is to be used for the selective<br>
oxidation of CO and NO. HC is also oxidized very well.<br>
Preferably, the catalyst is present as coating on a catalyst<br>
support body, preferably a metallic or ceramic monolithic shaped<br>
body, a non-woven or a metal foam.<br>
The scope of the invention also includes a catalyst component which<br>
contains the catalyst according to the invention. The catalyst<br>
component is accordingly equipped with a housing in which the<br>
catalyst is located. The housing has an inlet and outlet opening<br>
for the exhaust gas to be treated.<br>
The catalyst component can be used as component in an exhaust-gas<br>
system. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the catalyst<br>
component is fitted upstream of a diesel particle filter and/or<br>
an SCR catalyst. Through the high activity of the catalyst for the<br>
oxidation of NO to NO2, for example a particle filter is supplied<br>
with enough NO2 to oxidize soot particles, wherein N02 itself is<br>
reduced. NO2 that is not required is preferably converted to<br>
harmless nitrogen in a downstream SCR catalyst using ammonia or<br>
an ammonia precursor.<br>
A subject of the invention is thus also an exhaust-gas system<br>
comprising a catalyst according to the invention and in addition<br>
a diesel particle filter and/or an SCR catalyst.<br>
The invention will now be described in more detail with the help<br>
of some embodiment examples which are however to be considered as<br>
not limiting the scope of the invention. Reference is made in<br>
addition to Figures 1 to 3.<br>
Embodiment examples:<br>
Example 1<br>
1. Impregnation<br>
The water absorption of an aluminium oxide (Puralox SCF a-140 L3<br>
from Sasol) stabilized with lanthanum was first determined by<br>
weighing the powder, slurrying in water, filtering and then<br>
weighing again while wet. It was 50.18 wt.-%.<br>
In a planetary mixer, 110.4 g of a 13.59% solution of platinum<br>
ethanolamine (ethanolammonium hexahydroxoplatinate) was added<br>
slowly dropwise to 300 g of the dry Puralox powder accompanied by<br>
stirring. The powder was dried for 2 days at 80°C in the vacuum<br>
drying cupboard, with the result that 5 wt.-% platinum would be.<br>
contained on a completely dry powder.<br>
2. Washcoat production, coating:<br>
500 g of this vacuum-dried powder (from 2 impregnation batches)<br>
was topped up with 2500 g water, de-agglomerated with an<br>
Ultra-Turrax stirrer and then milled with a bead mill (4000 rpm,<br>
1.2-mm Zr02 beads).<br>
400-cpsi cordierite honeycombs were coated with this washcoat by<br>
immersion and blowing. The honeycombs were then in each case dried<br>
again at 80 °C in the vacuum drying cupboard.<br>
As a drying at 80°C under vacuum in this way does not necessarily<br>
take place completely, a loading of 60 g washcoat/1 honeycomb was<br>
first produced by repeated coating. When the aluminium oxide is<br>
dry, this should correspond to a platinum loading of 3.0 g/1. A<br>
honeycomb from a series of identically coated and only vacuum-dried<br>
honeycombs was then calcined at 500°C for 3 h and the platinum<br>
content analytically (pulping and ICP analysis) determined. This<br>
honeycomb (diameter 3 cm, length 8.8 cm) was coated with 3.68 g<br>
washcoat and weighed 33.4 g. With a Pt content of 5 wt.-%, the<br>
honeycomb should thus contain 0.55 wt.-% Pt when completely dry.<br>
0.44 wt.-% platinum was determined from the analysis, because the<br>
3.68 g weight of the washcoat was not completely dry and still<br>
contained water.<br>
The weight of the honeycomb after vacuum drying and the weight of<br>
the honeycomb after calcining and the platinum concentration were<br>
used to calculate how much platinum must still be coated on the<br>
honeycomb for there to be 3.5 g/1 platinum on a honeycomb. The<br>
platinum quantity which was already on the honeycomb and the<br>
washcoat loading after vacuum drying were able to be used to<br>
calculate what weight the not completely dry honeycomb<br>
vacuum-dried at 8 0°C must have at the end in order to have 3.5 g<br>
Pt/1 honeycomb volume. The honeycombs were then coated up to this<br>
weight, with the result that, at the end, each honeycomb had a<br>
platinum content of 3.5 g/1 honeycomb volume.<br>
3. Calcining of the vacuum-dried honeycombs under a gas mixture<br>
which contained 1 vol.-% NO in nitrogen.<br>
The coated honeycombs were introduced into a quartz glass tube<br>
using a ceramic fibre blanket for the sealing. A gas mixture of<br>
1 vol.-% NO in nitrogen was conducted over the catalyst in the<br>
calcining unit. In front of the quartz glass tube there was a heater<br>
which very quickly heated the gas mixture to up to 490 °C immediately<br>
before the honeycomb. Around the quartz glass tube there was an<br>
IR oven which was also able to heat up the honeycombs quickly by<br>
means of IR radiation.<br>
In this structure, the gas stream of 1 vol.-% CO in nitrogen was<br>
heated before the honeycomb from room temperature to 450°C within<br>
50 s and then further via a PID controller to 4 90°C within a further<br>
minute. At the same time, a heating-up of the IR oven to 600 °C at<br>
100°C/min was started. A measurement with a thermocouple in the<br>
honeycomb produced at the end a temperature of 500°C in the<br>
honeycomb. This temperature was reached after 6 min. Under these<br>
conditions, after these 6 min, calcining was continued for another<br>
20 min at a gas inlet temperature of 490°C and an IR oven temperature<br>
of 600°C.<br>
Comparison example 1:<br>
1. Impregnation:<br>
The water absorption of an aluminium oxide (Puralox SCF a-140 L3<br>
from Sasol) stabilized with lanthanum was first determined by<br>
weighing the powder, slurrying in water, filtering and then<br>
weighing again while wet. It was 50.18 wt.-%.<br>
In a planetary mixer, 144.2 g of a 13.87% solution of platinum<br>
ethanolamine (ethanolammonium hexahydroxoplatinate) was added<br>
slowly dropwise to 400 g of the dry Puralox powder accompanied by<br>
stirring. The powder was then dried in the drying oven at 8 0°C for<br>
3 hours. The powder was then calcined in a calcining oven in air<br>
for 3 h at 500°C (heat-up rate 2°C/min).<br>
2. Washcoat production, coating:<br>
140 g of this already calcined powder was topped up to 700 g with<br>
water, de-agglomerated with an Ultra-Turrax stirrer and then<br>
milled with a bead mill (4000 rpm, 1.2-mm Zr©2 'beads) .<br>
400-cpsi cordierite honeycombs were coated with this washcoat by<br>
immersion and blowing. The honeycombs were then in each case dried<br>
again and calcined for 3 h at 500CC.<br>
This coating was repeated until a loading of 7 0 g washcoat/1<br>
honeycomb was reached. As the powder had a platinum content of 5<br>
wt.-%, this meant that the honeycomb also had a platinum content<br>
of 3.5 g/1.<br>
Comparison example 2:<br>
1. A honeycomb impregnated with platinum ethanolamine and<br>
vacuum-dried was produced as described in Example 1.<br>
2. Calcining of the vacuum-dried honeycombs under air.<br>
The coated honeycombs were introduced into a quartz glass tube<br>
using a ceramic fibre blanket for the sealing.<br>
In the calcining unit, air was conducted over the catalyst.<br>
In front of the quartz glass tube there was a heater which very<br>
quickly heated the air to up to 490°C immediately before the<br>
honeycomb. Around the quartz glass tube there was an IR oven which<br>
also heated up the honeycombs quickly by means of IR radiation.<br>
In this structure, the air stream was heated before the honeycomb<br>
from room temperature to 450°C within 50 s and then further via<br>
a PID controller to an inlet temperature of 490°C within a further<br>
minute. At the same time, a heating-up of the IR oven to 600°C at<br>
100°C/min was started. The measurement with a thermocouple in the<br>
honeycomb thus produced at the end a temperature of 500°C in the<br>
honeycomb. This temperature was reached after 6 min. Under these<br>
conditions, after these 6 min, calcining was continued for another<br>
20 min at a gas inlet temperature of 490°C and an IR oven temperature<br>
of 600°C.<br>
Comparison example 3:<br>
1. A honeycomb impregnated with platinum ethanolamine and<br>
vacuum-dried is produced as described in Example 1.<br>
2. Calcining with 2000 ppm propylene in air:<br>
The coated honeycombs were introduced into a quartz glass tube<br>
using a ceramic fibre blanket for the sealing. The calcining of<br>
the vacuum-dried honeycombs took place in a calcining unit with<br>
a gas mixture of 2000 ppm propylene in air by conducting the gas<br>
stream over the catalyst.<br>
In front of the quartz glass tube there was a heater which very<br>
quickly heated the gas mixture to up to 490°C immediately before<br>
the honeycomb. Around the quartz glass tube there was an IR oven<br>
which also heated up the honeycombs quickly by means of IR<br>
radiation.<br>
In this structure, the gas stream was heated up before the honeycomb<br>
from room temperature to 450°C within 50 s and then further via<br>
a PID controller to an inlet temperature of 490°C within a further<br>
minute. At the same time, a heating-up of the IR oven to 600°C at<br>
100°C/min was started. The measurement with a thermocouple in the<br>
honeycomb produced at the end a temperature of 500°C in the<br>
honeycomb. This temperature was reached after 6 min. Under these<br>
conditions, after these 6 min, calcining was continued for another<br>
20 min at a gas inlet temperature of 490°C and an IR oven temperature<br>
of 600°C.<br>
Comparison example 4<br>
1. A honeycomb impregnated with platinum ethanolamine and<br>
vacuum-dried is produced as described in Example 1.<br>
2. Calcining of the vacuum-dried honeycombs under a gas mixture<br>
of 1 vol.-% CO in nitrogen.<br>
The coated honeycombs were introduced into a quartz glass tube<br>
using a ceramic fibre blanket for the sealing. A gas mixture of<br>
1 vol.-% CO in nitrogen was conducted over the catalyst in the<br>
calcining unit. In front of the quartz glass tube there was a heater<br>
which very quickly heated the gas mixture to up to 490°C immediately<br>
before the honeycomb. Around the quartz glass tube there was an<br>
IR oven which also heated up the honeycombs quickly by means of<br>
IR radiation. In this structure, the gas stream was heated up before<br>
the honeycomb from room temperature to 450 °C within 50 s and then<br>
further via a PID controller to an inlet temperature of 490°C within<br>
a further minute. At the same time, a heating-up of the IR oven<br>
to 600°C at 100°C/min was started. The measurement with a<br>
thermocouple in the honeycomb thus produced at the end a<br>
temperature of 550°C in the honeycomb. This temperature was reached<br>
after 6 min. Under these conditions, after these 6 min, calcining<br>
was continued for another 20 min at a gas inlet temperature of 4 90°C<br>
and an IR oven temperature of 600°C.<br>
Example 5:<br>
Comparison test of the catalysts:<br>
The catalyst honeycombs produced in Example 1 and the comparison<br>
examples were tested for the oxidation of CO, propylene and NO in<br>
a reactor under the following conditions.<br>
The gas stream was heated up before the catalyst. For the test,<br>
the catalyst was first operated for 30 min under these gas<br>
conditions at 390°C and then cooled down in steps of 10°C. Each<br>
temperature was maintained for 8 min and the product gas<br>
composition determined between 7 and 8 min. Below 250°C, the<br>
cooling down took place in 5°C steps in order to be able to more<br>
precisely determine in particular the CO light-off temperature<br>
(50% CO conversion).<br>
Figure 1: shows the CO conversion of the catalysts used:<br>
It is clear that the catalyst calcined with NO in N2 has the best<br>
CO light-off temperature with at the same time a 4very high NO<br>
oxidation (see Figure 3). The catalyst which was calcined with 1<br>
vol.-% CO in nitrogen displays a very good light-off temperature<br>
for CO, but also a lower oxidation activity for the oxidation of<br>
NO to NO2, as can be seen from Figure 3.<br>
Figure 2 shows the propylene conversion (a hydrocarbon, HC) of the<br>
catalysts used. Here too, the catalyst calcined with NO in nitrogen<br>
is very good.<br>
The yield for the oxidation of NO to NO2 is represented in Figure<br>
3. It is clear that not only is the catalyst which was calcined<br>
with CO in nitrogen better for an oxidation reaction, but the<br>
catalyst surprisingly oxidizes much less NO to N02 under the same<br>
conditions in the same test. However, this is not the case with<br>
a calcining with 1 vol.-% NO in nitrogen. Although the catalyst<br>
which was calcined with propylene in air delivers the best NO<br>
oxidation, it displays a clearly poorer CO light-off temperature.<br>
The catalyst according to the invention which was calcined with<br>
NO in nitrogen displays the best combination of very good CO<br>
light-off temperature and a very high activity for the oxidation<br>
of NO to N02.<br>
In all ranges, the catalyst calcined with propylene in air is at<br>
least better than the catalysts calcined only in'air.<br>
