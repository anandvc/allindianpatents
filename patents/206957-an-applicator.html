ORIGINAL<br>
THE	FOLLOWING	SPECIFICATION<br>
PARTICULARLY	DESCRIBES	THE<br>
NATURE OF THIS INVENTION AND THE MANNER IN WHICH IT IS TO 3E PERFOMED.<br><br>
AN APPLICATOR FOR APPLYING POWDER PRODUCT<br>
FIELD OF INVENTION:<br>
This invention relates to the field of applicators for powder products such as insecticide and/or repellent, especially for treatment against-crawling insects such as cockroach and bugs over a desired area. Particularly, this invention relates to an applicator for dabbing safely and conveniently, a fine powder of insecticide over crawling insect encroachment areas, especially for household purposes.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION:<br>
Conventionally, dusting powders are known in the art of eradicating encroachment of insects particularly crawling insects such as cockroach, bug etc., and such dusting powders are known to be used through public health schemes either by primitive methods or by use of sophisticated machines on a community scale.<br>
US Patent 3821940 describes an animal activated insecticide dust applicator for application of dust to an animal includes a first bad or container for storage of the dust and having a second bag or container depending there from and formed of porous material to permit escape or dispensing of dust there from. The first bag or container has discharge or delivery control structure therein activated by animal contact with the container to cause flow of dust from the first container to the second container and agitation of the second container by animal causes dust to work, through the second container and onto the animal. The structure is supported o n a standard which also has an attractive media such as a support of a food supplement or the like to attract the animal. The applicator as described by said US patent can be used for dusting the insecticide powder on animals on agitation by the animal.<br>
However, for domestic applications, chalk sticks containing insecticide powders are known in the art for eradicating encroachment of insects particularly crawling insects such as cockroach, bug etc., which inherently leave a line containing loose powder. The insect coming into contact with<br><br>
the loose powder gets affected either directly or through ingestion of loose powder picked up by the insect.<br>
Moreover, the drawn lines remain stuck to the areas where used and the portion, majority of the powder which remain stuck on the surface is not picked up by the insect.<br>
The loose powder on such drawn lines does not turn out to be fine which could be easily picked up by the crawling insect. A part of the loose powder remains big and heavy enough that a crawling insect does not pick up while crossing the said line.<br>
Another disadvantage of the chalk stick is that there exists possibility of breakage of the said chalk stick, and besides that, the end portion always gets wasted as it is almost impossible to hold and draw a line with such end portion. Thus there is a huge amount of wastage of the insecticide powder when used along with a chalk stick.<br>
Therefore there has been a need to address and find effective solution to the problems associated with the use of chalk stick and provide a device which would enable convenient, safe, easy and effective application of insecticide fine powder over insect encroachment areas in household applications.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION:<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide an applicator for a powder product ready for use, and provide in particular, a good hold of the powder on the applicator during its carriage, as well as a good transfer of the powder during its application to a surface to be treated, thus obtaining a more effective application.<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide an applicator which would addresses all the inherent faults associated with the use of chalks sticks and enable making use of an insecticide powder which is fine enough to be picked up by the crawling insects and could be conveniently dusted in areas where treatment is required.<br><br><br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide an applicator which would enable dusting of insecticide powder in the area of treatment whereby a larger area could be covered for spreading insecticide powder which is fine enough to be picked up by the crawling insects.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide an applicator which would enable dabbing of fine powder insecticide on the bodies of the animals and humans to get rid of ectoparasites such as blood sucking flies, and exposed skin of human beings to repel mosquitoes.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION:<br>
According to the present invention, the applicator comprises a support, wherein said support has a rounded, square or a rectangular head to provide an easy grip for holding said applicator during use. A porous bag containing a powder product such as insect repellent is attached with the support. The support further comprises a skirt to shield the users fingers from coming into contact with the bag while dabbing over desired surface.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS:<br>
To complement the description that is being given and in order to promote a better understanding of the characteristics of the invention in accordance with a practical embodiment of the same and as an integral part of the said description a set of drawings accompany it in which, in an illustrative and non-restrictive way, the following are represented:-<br>
Fig.1 is the front elevation of the applicator according to the present invention.<br>
Fig. 2 is the exploded perspective view of the applicator of Fig 1.<br><br><br>
Fig. 3 is the illustrative scheme of the method of making the porous bag according to the present invention.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS:<br>
The present invention discloses an applicator for powder products such as insecticide powder such powder, used in the form of fine particles for dabbing over a surface for preventing encroachment of insects especially crawling insects such as cockroach, ants, bugs, etc.,<br>
The applicator in accordance with one aspect of the present invention has its origin in the finding that, surprisingly, the applicator is economical, convenient, safer and more efficacious for use in areas infested or frequented by crawling insects such as bedbugs, cockroach, ants, and the like and their hiding places in household applications.<br>
Figs. 1A &amp; 1B - Referring to Figs. 1A &amp; 1B, the applicator 1 in accordance with the present invention comprises a support member hereinafter referred to as a support 2 which firmly holds a porous bag 6 containing a powder product such as an insecticide, a repellent, an attractant, an anti-feedant, bait or a combination thereof. A cover member hereinafter referred to as a cover 5 is push fitted to the support 2.<br>
In the embodiment shown in Fig 2, the support 2 comprises a head part 2a and a skirt part 2b. The support 2 comprises a sleeve part 2c adjoining the other end of the skirt part 2b. The support 2 may be made of a material selected from one or more among the group consisting of plastic, elastomer, rubber, paper and a composite material. Preferably, the support 2 is made of a plastic material.<br><br><br>
The head part 2a is preferably configured in the form of a substantially rounded, square or a rectangular object or a combination of such shapes. By virtue of its form, the head part 2a facilitates gripping of the applicator by hand during use.<br>
The skirt part 2b is preferably frustro-conical in shape and shields the user's hands from contacting the outer surface of the bag 6 containing the powder product thereby providing safe and economic use of the applicator.<br>
During use, the head part 2a is held by the user for dabbing over surfaces infested or frequented by the said crawling insects and their hiding places.<br>
The cover 5 is push fitted to the sleeve part 2c of the support 2 for covering the porous bag 6 when the applicator is not in use.<br>
The porous bag 6 containing the powder product is made of a foam material preferably sponge.<br>
Alternatively, the porous bag 6 is made of a material selected from one or more from the group consisting of rubber, nylon, rayon, polyamide and polyester.<br>
Typically, the thickness of the porous bag 6 is less than 50mm, preferably 2mm to 20mm, most preferably 3mm to 10mm.<br>
Typically, powder product has an average particle size in the range from 0.5 -500 micrometers, most preferably 10-100 micrometers. The powder product may comprise active technical insecticide/repellent from 0.05 wt% to 100 wt%. FIG. 3 illustrates a method of making a porous bag for use in the applicator according to the present invention. A foam sheet of required length is cut in the form of a disk 3b, for example with a diameter of 5 inches. Powder is poured in the center of the disk 3b, and the disk 3b is turned inwards to form a bag with a neck which may be tied with a string, or simply twisted for sealing. An adhesive is<br><br><br>
applied inside the skirt part 2b and the outer side of the porous bag 6 and then the neck is inserted inside the skirt part 2b to form an applicator.   <br>
The applicator in accordance with the invention when used, the powder product in the porous bag 6, on being dabbed, pushes said powder product outwards the porous bag 6 for spreading the powder in required location. Surprisingly, powder is even pushed into crevices, effectively reaching the hiding places of bedbugs, ants and cockroaches. The other advantage of the said porous sponge sheet bag is that unless dabbed a few times say for example 3-6 times, the said powder product does not come out of the said porous bag when used the first time enabling packing of the product more neatly without requirement of sealing the porous bag.<br>
Similarly an insecticide/repellent powder can be dabbed on the bodies of the animals to rid of the ecto-parasites or blood sucking flies and exposed skin of humans to repel mosquitoes.<br>
The applicator in accordance with the invention offers remarkable ease of use, economy, safety to the user and above all an effective method of household pest<br>
control against crawling insects.<br>
The foregoing description of a preferred embodiment of the invention has been presented for purposes of illustration and description, and is not intended to be exhaustive or to limit the invention to the precise form disclosed. The description was selected to best explain the principles of the invention and their practical application to enable others skilled in the art to best utilize the invention in various embodiments and various modifications as are suited to the particular use contemplated.
