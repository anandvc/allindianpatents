				<td>Installation for cold aseptic filling of a liquid filling material in bottles or the equivalent containers.<br>
The invention refers to an installation for cold aseptic filling of a liquid filling material in bottles or the equivalent as per generic term of the patent claim 1.<br>
Installations for cold aseptic filling of a liquid filling material in bottles or the equivalent containers, as for example cold aseptic filling of heat sensitive beverages (as for example fruit juices) are known in most different executions. The individual machines, building such an installation and connecting in the production - or treatment lines to each other like as for example rinsing unit, sterilizers, filling machines, sealing unit are provided with housings and that in fact in the way that within the installation it provides a transport track for the containers or the bottles in a sterile chamber which through these housings is sealed against the bordering non-sterile chambers or areas as for example the surrounding in particular against a penetration of embryos.<br>
Among others in the use of machines of circulating design, which is usual for rinsing unit, sterilizers, filling machines and/or sealing machines a such housing shows as a rule more number of cross overs between a rotating or circulating part of the housing and a stationary part of this housing so that on these areas special sealings are required.<br>
It is known (WO2004 / 065289) to design such type of sealings as labyrinth - or siphon sealings. Each siphon-sealing is made out therein mainly of at least one channel type conduit or annular conduit surrounding in circular shape the rotation or circulating axle of the circulating part of the housing, in which a circular ring shaped wall section enters on an item of the siphon-sealing planned on the other part of the housing.<br>
At least during the filling operation the annular conduit is filled with a sealing liquid so far that at least also one ring shaped wall section of the siphon-sealing dips sufficiently deep in the sealing liquid, so that the gap remaining between both the items of the respective siphon-sealing is densely sealed through the sealing liquid. The sealing liquid contains preferably a sterilising medium and comprises as for example distilled, sterile water with a share in hydrogen peroxide H2O2. As a rule, the item of siphon-sealing forming at least an annular conduit is planned on the not circulating part and the item of the siphon-sealing showing the ring shaped wall section entering in the annular conduit is planned on the circulating part of the housing on the respective cross over.<br>
In order to achieve the attempted sealing - and locking effect it is required that the meniscus of the sealing liquid does not go below a specified level in the respective annular conduit. In the known machine for this, an independent buffer container for the sealing liquid is allocated to each siphon-sealing which is combined over a pipe line with the annular conduit of the siphon-sealing as per way of communicating tubes. Through an electronic regulating circuit with a filling level sensor in the buffer container and a control valve in a supply line the liquid meniscus therein of the sealing liquid is maintained on a specific level, so that also the liquid meniscus of the sealing liquid shows the specified level in the annular conduit of the corresponding siphon-sealing.<br>
Depending on design, at an installation for cold aseptic filling such type siphon-sealings on different levels are necessary, so that in the known installation at least for each level an<br>
1<br><br>
independent buffer container with regulating circuit and the corresponding components (sensors, control valves etc) is necessary, which means a substantial design cost.<br>
It is the assignment of the invention to remove this disadvantage and to demonstrate an installation for cold aseptic filling of a liquid filling material in bottles or the equivalent containers, in which inspite of simplified design the presence of the sealing or locking liquid is ensured at least in one annular conduit of at least one siphon-sealing with the required level. For solution of this assignment an installation corresponding to the patent claim 1 is designed. Also in the installation as per invention, as a rule multiple number of siphon-sealings, on different level in each case on the cross overs between a circulating or rotating part of the housing and a stationary part of the housing are planned. All siphon-sealings or rather their annular conduits are then supplied with sealing liquid continuously out of a common stock- or supply container or reservoir and as a matter of fact as for example by a common pump and from the medium allocated individually to separate siphon-sealings, for adjustment or control of the volume flow of the sealing liquid flowing into the respective siphon-sealing. As because at least one outlet of the respective annular conduit is designed as over flow, the necessary level of the liquid meniscus of the sealing liquid adjusts itself independently without the necessity of an electronic control circuit in each annular conduit.<br>
Through the medium planned individually in the supply or rather in the supply pipe line of the siphon-sealing for the adjustment or control of the volume flow hydrostatic differences, which result through the different height level of different siphon-sealings, are balanced out. Preferably these mediums for the adjustment and the control of the volume flow from adjusting valves are built, which as for example are adjusted once in the commissioning of the installation. Through the adjustment of the volume flow of the sealing liquid also different pollution conditions on the individual siphon-sealings are taken into account; that means the volume flow on such siphon-sealings, at which the sealing liquid is subjected through the development and/or assembly of the respective sealing and/or through external influences to higher pollution or nucleation is adjusted higher than at such siphon-sealings, at which the degree of pollution is less.<br>
In order to identify immediately possible occurring defects in the supply system for the supply of siphon-sealings with the locking or sealing liquid and to cause the corresponding action taking in case of a defect as for example the initiation of a defect signal and/or interruption of the filling process, a flow meter is assembled in the sealing liquid return flow of each siphon-sealing which determines in fact either the volume flow of the return flowing sealing liquid and compares with the volume flow of sealing liquid flown in to the corresponding siphon-sealing so that in case of a difference exceeding the permissible tolerance limit, the defect signal and/or the production interruption are caused or even the defect signal and/or the immediate production interruption are then caused, when from the corresponding flow meter no return flowing sealing liquid is found out or even the volume flow determined by the flow meter lies below a specified threshold value.<br>
A level control of the liquid meniscus of the sealing liquid in the siphon-sealings, as per the scheme of invention is neither planned nor required. Here through there arises mainly a simplification of the design and over and above that a mainly improved operation safety, as because electronic control circuits regulating the level of the liquid meniscus are avoided.<br>
2<br><br>
In a preferred execution shape of the invention in at least one cross over between the circulating or rotating part of the housing and the stationary part of the housing additionally at least one mechanical sealing is planned which is then made out of a sealing item stretching along the siphon-sealing on one of the housings, which with a sealing area is jointly effective on an other part of the housing.<br>
This mechanical sealing on the side of the siphon-sealing turned towards the non-sterile area is preferred herein, so that the siphon-sealing is shielded through the mechanical sealing against the non-sterile area. Through here there arise multiple number of further advantages. Thus through this mechanical sealing, then the direct contact of the sealing liquid with the non-sterile area or rather with the air therein is avoided, through which in particular the nucleation and/or pollution of sealing liquid is reduced. Further more, also an appearance of sealing liquid and/or of the sterilization medium present in this liquid, is prevented in the non-stenile area and thus in particular also impairments, as for example odour worries for persons, as for example service staff, who stay in the non-sterile area.<br>
In a further execution shape of the invention, at least one siphon-sealing with at least one exit opening or - nozzle for a cleaning - or sterilization medium is provided, so that this sealing or rather their annular conduit can then be cleaned and/or sterilized in a CIP-cleaning or SIP-sterilization, which in particular is of great advantage in an installation with a multiple of siphon-sealings planned at housing crossover, in particular the cleaning and sterilization of the siphon-sealings of an installation with a multiple number of such sealings are mainly simplified and can be carried out with less time consumption.<br>
Further development of the invention are items of the subordinate claims.<br>
The invention is explained closer in the following with the help of the Figures on an execution example. They show:<br>
Figure 1	in very simplified block representation multiple number, of individual<br>
machines put together to an installation, for a cold sterile or cold aseptic filling of a filling material in bottles.<br>
Figure 2	in part representation one of the treatment-or rather sterilization heads of a<br>
device or individual machine (sterilizer) for sterilization of the bottles together with a siphon-or labyrinth sealing on a housing cross over separating a sterile chamber from a non-sterile chamber as for example the surrounding.<br>

sealings with the required locking-or sealing liquid.<br>
Figure 4	a representation like Figure 2, however in an execution for a CIP-cleaning<br>
and/or SIP-sterilization of the siphon-or rather labyrinth-sealing.<br>
The total installation denoted in the Figure 1 in general with 1 serves the purpose of cold aseptic filling of a liquid filling material in bottles 2 which are supplied to the installation 1 by a carrier 3 (arrow A) and as for example in the installation are at first cleaned and are treated in a sterilizer 4 with a suitable treatment medium, among others with a heated or<br>
3 <br>
volatilized aerosol made out of air and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), are followingly filled in a filling machine 5 with the filling material and finally sealed in a sealing unit 6, so that the filled and sealed bottles2 can be supplied by the carrier 7 to a further station as for example a labeling machine.<br>
Within the installation 1 the bottles move in an embryo free chamber sealed sterile outward, which is built by a corresponding housing. Since however the sterilizer 4 like wise as other individuals machines as for example the filling machine 5 and the sealing machine 6 as well as possibly a not represented rinsing unit, are built as machines of circulating design, there arise in the area of the housing or rather at the separation between the sterile chamber and the non-sterile chamber also housing cross over between in each case a rotating or circulating item and a stationary that means not circulating item. A such type cross over is represented as example in Figure 2 and is denoted with arrow 8.<br>
In order to seal such cross over, siphon-or labyrinth sealings are planned there. One such type of sealing is represented as for example in the Figure 2 and is in general denoted with 9.<br>
In detail the Figure 2 shows a treatment head 10 of the sterilizer 4. This treatment head is planned on the upper side of a disk type rotor 11 driven circulating around a vertical machine axle and shows mainly the design known to experts and in fact among others with a nozzle tube 12 which projects over the lower side of the rotor 11 and which for sterilization of the respective bottle 2 may be entered in this through their bottle mouth 2.1.<br>
The bottles 2 are held in each case on a bottle carrier 13, which is planned in the area of each treatment head 10 on the rotor 11. The lowering and lifting of the nozzle tube takes place pneumatically through an operating equipment (piston 14 and reset spring 15) planned in the housing of the treatment head 10. In the treatment head 10 further a screw shaped conduit 16 is designed which during the sterilization phase is flown through by the treatment-or sterilization medium prepared in the nozzle assembly 17. The treatment head 10 is further sealed so firmly on the upper side of the disk shaped rotor 11, that purely the nozzle tube 12 projects through a sealed opening 18 in rotor 11 over the lower side of this rotor.<br>
The rotor 11 as well as a wall 19 not circulating with the rotor that means stationary on a machine rack 20 are parts of the housing, which separates a sterile chamber 21, which is designed within the rotor 11 and within the wall 19, in which the bottles 2 move, from an external non-sterile chamber 22. On the cross over 8 between the rotor 11 and the stationary wall item 19, as already executed a siphon-or rather labyrinth-sealing 9 is located. This comprises in the represented execution shape mainly a ring 23, surrounding concentrically the vertical axle of the rotor 11, planned on machine rack 20, not circulating with the rotor 11, which forms an open annular conduit 24 on the upper side. In this annular conduit 24 from upward a circular ring shaped wall section 25 surrounding concentrically the axle of rotor 11 enters which is a component of one ring body 26 fastened on the circumference of circular disk shaped rotor 11.<br>
For the purpose of sterile sealing of the chamber 21 against the surrounding 22 the annular conduit 24 is filled up to level 27 with a sealing liquid, so that the wall section 25 with a<br>
4<br><br>
larger part of it's axial length is dipped in this liquid and through this provides the siphon-or labyrinth-sealing.<br>
The sealing liquid comprises as for example sterile or rather distilled water and possesses, in order to take into account the hygienic requirement of the filling process, sterilizing, cleaning and embryo killing properties, which in particular is achieved through maintenance of a minimum concentration on an embryo killing and sterilizing additive, as for example on H2O2. The H2O2 - concentration amounts as for example to 35%.<br>
A seal ring 28 with sealing lip 29 out of a suitable rubber elastic material or elastomer plastic lying externally radial related to the axle of rotor 11 is planned on the ring body 26. The sealing lip 29 of the seal ring 28 surrounding concentrically the axle of the rotor 11 lies on a ring shaped sealing area 30 surrounding concentrically like wise the axle of the rotor 11, which is planned on the side of the ring 23 lying externally radial turned away from the rotor 11. The sealing 28 jointly working with the sealing area 30 forms an additional mechanical sealing 31. It is essential herein that this sealing 31 is planned between the siphon-or rather labyrinth sealing 9 and the non-sterile area 22 as for example the surrounding that means the mechanical sealing 31 shields the siphon-or rather labyrinth-sealing 9 against the surrounding 22.<br>
Through the mechanical sealing 31, among others it is prevented that sealing-or locking liquid or the sterilization medium present in this liquid gets into the surrounding and through it persons staying in this surrounding, in particular also service staff, at least through the odour of the sealing liquid are impaired and/or through this sealing liquid are polluted and/or endangered.<br>
Through the mechanical sealing 31 the sealing liquid is effectively protected against the pollution and/or germ formation of the surrounding 22, so that the attempted sealing effect is attained with higher security and additionally the costs for maintaining of the desired H2O2 concentration are lowered.<br>
It is essential for achieving the desired sealing effect among others, that the annular conduit 26 is filled with the sealing liquid sufficiently that means upto level 27 and thus the section 25 enters sufficiently deep in the sealing liquid. This is ensured through it that during the filling operation through one or more number of inlets 32 sealing liquid is supplied continuously to the annular conduit 24 and this liquid is removed through one or more number of outlets 33 continuously from the annular conduit 24. The outlets 33 are executed as over flows, so that through here automatically that means without a control the level 27 of the liquid meniscus of the sealing liquid adjusts in the annular conduit 24.<br>
In the area of the installation 1 more number of cross overs 8 are planned between a circulating part and a stationary part of the housing and in fact as for example in the area of the filling machine 5 and in the area of the sealing unit 6. On all these cross-overs 8 the siphon-or rather labyrinth-sealings 9 corresponding to siphon-or rather labyrinth-sealing 9 are planned and in fact preferably again with, in each case, an additional mechanical sealing 31 on the externally lying that means sides of respective siphon-sealing 9 turned to the surrounding.<br>
For the supply to all siphon-sealings 9, which among others dependent on machines are assembled on different levels, the supply system repeated in the Figure 3 serves. This<br>
5<br><br>
covers among others a preparation-and reserve tank 34 for the fresh sealing liquid. To this tank, H2O2 as well as distilled and sterile water are supplied through control valve 36 and 37 operated from a processor 35 and in fact in independence of the required and monitored by a sensor 38, H2O2 - concentration (as for example 35%) of the sealing liquid.<br>
The supply tank 34 is connected to different ring-or supply lines 41, which in each case are combined through a control valve 42 for adjustment of the volume flow or rather flow amount with the inlets 32 of the annular conduit 24 of a siphon-sealing 9. The respective control valve 42, therein as for example in the commissioning or in the sample run is adjusted such that inspite of the different height level of the individual siphon-sealings 9, sufficient sealing liquid flows into the annular conduit of each siphon-sealing 9 and in fact not only for maintaining of the required level 27 of the liquid meniscus of the sealing liquid in the respective annular conduit 24 but also for achieving of a sufficient exchange of sealing liquid in the respective annular conduit 24 among others also depending on he degree of pollution to be expected. With the respective control valve 42 thus preferably a constant volume flow for the sealing liquid flowing into the respective siphon-sealing 9 is adjusted.<br>
The out lets 33 of each annular conduit 24 are combined with a joint pipe line 43, in which a flow meter 44 is planned and which leads to a buffer tank 45. Through a control valve 46 planned on the out let of the buffer tank 45, the buffer tank 45 is emplied level controlled and in fact in one ring-or collection pipe line 47 common for all siphon-sealings 9, through which the sealing liquid is led back to the tank 34 by means of an additional pump 48 planned in this collection pipe line. In the collection pipe line 47a sensor-or analysis unit 49 is planned with which the F^CVcontent of the led back sealing liquid is analysed, so that then depending on the measurement data delivered by this sensor unit 49 through the processor 35 the addition to H2O2 can be controlled and in fact for maintaining of the required H^C^-concentration.<br>
Through the supply system represented in the Figure 3, among others it is ensured that all siphon sealings 9 are supplied also on different height levels sufficiently with sealing liquid and the sealing liquid in each siphon sealing 9 shows also the required H2O2-concentration. A main safety factor forms herein the flow meter 44 planned individually in the return pipe line 43 of each siphon-sealing 9. The flow meter 44 monitors that a sufficient amount in sealing liquid flows back through the out let 33 built as overflow. Then, when the amount in sealing liquid flowing through the flow meter 44 goes below a specified lower threshold value, on ground of measurement data of the flow meter 44 a disturbance of installation 1 is indicated optically and/or acoustically and/or the operation of the installation 1 is stopped.<br>
For this with the flow meter 44, as for example the volume flow of sealing liquid flowing back from the siphon-sealing is found out and then with firm value of the volume flow of the sealing liquid flowing to the respective siphon-sealing 9 is compared. In case of a difference going beyond a specified tolerance value a defect signal is initiated, which leads to the optical and/or acoustic defect signal and/or causes an immediate production interruption. Basically as for example there exists also the possibility to design the flow meter such that a defect signal is then caused, when the volume flow of the sealing liquid flowing back from the respective siphon-sealing 9 goes below a specified threshold value.<br>
6<br><br>
Projectedly it was started from there that the led back sealing liquid after passing of sensor unit 49 gets in to the tank 34 again. Basically there exists also the possibility to plan a further preparation of the sealing liquid before this is then led back to the tank 34.<br>
The described design of the siphon-sealing 9 permits it also in the cleaning of the installation 1 to clean all siphon-sealings 9 in the scope of a CIP-cleaning (cleaning in place) as well as to sterilize in the scope of a SIP - sterilization (sterilization in place). Directly in the area of cold aseptic filling it is of special significance to clean regularly all internally lying areas of installation 1 that means located in the sterile chamber 21 and to disinfect or rather sterilize.<br>
For the CIP-cleaning or rather SIP-sterilization, corresponding to the Figure 4 on the respective siphon-sealings 9 additionally to the inlets 2 L and out lets 33, nozzles or rather nozzle openings 50 and 51 are planned which form a spray - and disinfection device and over which the respective siphon-sealing 9 and therein in particular it's ring 23 inclusive of annular conduit 24 is cleaned with a cleaning liquid or rather rinsed and flowingly can be treated with a liquid disinfection or sterilization medium as for example with a higher concentrated hydrogen peroxide solution. The nozzle openings 50 and 51 are connected for this to a corresponding system for the supply of cleaning and/or sterilization medium. The treatment medium getting into the annular conduit 24 flows off through the outlet 33. Additionally during the normal filling operation sealed outlets 22 serve the purpose for the complete emptying of the respective annular conduit 24.<br>
In the represented execution shape, the nozzles or rather nozzle openings 50 and 51 are planned on the rotating part that means on the ring body 26 circulating with the rotor, so that with a relatively less amount in cleaning-and disinfection medium a cleaning of the whole siphon-sealing 9 and in particular of the ring 32 with the annular conduit 24 is possible.<br>
The invention was described projectedly on an execution example. It is understood that numerous changes as well as modifications are possible without abandoning the invention concept lying at the base of the invention.<br>
