				<td>DRAPEABLE ABSORBENT ARTICLE<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The invention relates to absorbent articles tor use with undergarments or other clothing<br>
such as panty hose, swimsuits. or leotards. In particular, the absorbent articles of the present<br>
invention are drapeable.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Disposable absorbent articles such as. pantiliners, sanitary napkins, interlabial devices,<br>
adult incontinence devices and diapers are well known in the art. These articles typically have a<br>
fluid permeable body-facing side and fluid impermeable garment facing side. Additionally,<br>
such articles may include an absorbent layer for retaining fluids therebetween-<br>
Anatomical adaptation of an absorbent article may increase comfort to the wearer That<br>
is, movement by the wearer may cause the absorbent article to conform to the geometry of the<br>
space between the wearer's thighs. In contrast, if the absorbent article is stiff to begin with, the<br>
wearer may experience discomfort and be conscious ot the absorbent article. Additionally, if<br>
such an article bunches, there is a tendency to maintain its resulting distorted shape, thereby<br>
providing inadequate leakage protection.<br>
Various methods have been used to improve the flexibility of absorbent articles. For<br>
example, reducing the amount of absorbent matenal. using less stiff resilient materials and using<br>
thinner materials have been disclosed as possible solutions to the improving the flexibility of<br>
absorbent articles. See. for example, PCT Application No WO 98/09593 to Gilman, which<br>
purports to disclose a thin absorbent article that has a thickness of less than five millimeters and<br>
a crush recovery value of at least about fifteen mm.<br>
EP 1077052 (Lariviere et al discloses using preferential bending zones extending along<br>
the longitudinal axis of an absorbent article together with a pair of longitudinal adhesive zones<br>
that register with the preferential bending zones to improve flexibility<br>
Another method that has been disclosed to improve flexibility is increasing the elasticity<br>
of the article. See, for example, US Patent No. 4,773,904. Nakanishi et al and PCT Application<br>
No. WO 96/10978 (Palumbo et al.). In EP 0705583 and EP 0705586 (both to Querqui), the<br><br>
purported flexible absorbent article is disclosed as being elastically stretchable while having a<br>
water vapor permeable backsheet and a specific adhesive configuration.<br>
Adding regions of corrugation have been disclosed as yet another method to increase<br>
flexibility or conformability of absorbent articles. EP 1088536 (Carvalho) discloses using<br>
longitudinal corrugations to provide lateral extensibility Additionally, US Patent No. 5,607,415<br>
(Datta et al.) purports to disclose an absorbent article having a basin-like moisture banner with<br>
corrugations to provide an extendable region.<br>
NZ 236101 (Hujber et al.) discloses a pants liner having a creped portion that attaches<br>
directly onto the crotch area of the wearer's pants. Parts of the liner is capable of being draped<br>
down the tubular leg portion of the pants, without any bunching or folding occurring in the<br>
creped portion of the liner.<br>
However, the above absorbent articles are not fully flexible and do not adapt to the body<br>
as an undergarment alone does, thereby sacrificing comfort., protection and discretion. Thus,<br>
there is a need for a drapeable absorbent article that is fully flexible and adapts to the body as an<br>
undergarment alone does without sacrificing comfort, protection, and discretion. Applicants<br>
have surprsingly discovered such an absorbent article, which is described herein.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
The present invention is directed to an absorbent article having a silhouette including a<br>
first end, a second end, wherein the second end being in opposite relation to the first end, and a<br>
first longitudinally extending edge opposed to a second longitudinally extending edge, the first<br>
and second longitudinally extending edges connecting the lust end and the second end; and a<br>
layered portion having a body-facing layer and a garment-facing layer, wherein the absorbent<br>
article is drapable.<br>
In an alternate embodiment, the absorbent article also includes an absorbent layer and a<br>
transferlayer.<br>
Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
As used herein, the terms "drapeable" and "drapability" are used interchangeably and<br>
mean having a flexural resistance of about 30 g. or less as tested by the Modified Circular Bend<br>
Test, ASTM 4032-82 as set forth in the Example section below. It has been found that, for<br>
example, cotton underwear (e.g., Hanes Cotton underwear) has a flexural resistance of less than<br>
30 g.<br><br>
As used herein, all ranges provided are intended to expressly include at least all numbers<br>
that fall between the endpoints of ranges<br>
Absorbent articles of this invention have three portions: an anterior portion, a central<br>
portion, and a posterior portion and at least a body facing laser and a garment facing layer. Any<br>
sample of the present invention taken from any portion ot the entire article that includes all of the<br>
layers of the finished product is drapeable.<br>
In one embodiment of the present invention, the absorbent article has a body facing layer<br>
and a garment facing layer. In another embodiment, the absorbent article additionally includes<br>
an absorbent layer therebetween. Other embodiments may include additional layers such as, a<br>
transfer or distribution layer, multiple layer absorbent layers and unitized versions of two or<br>
more layers.<br>
The silhouette of absorbent articles of this invention includes those designed to fit<br>
undergarments having conventionally-shaped clotches. Additionally, absorbent articles of the<br>
present invention may also be designed to fit undergarments having abbreviated crotches<br>
including those of thong underwear, string underwear, G-string type underwear. Rio cut<br>
underwear, Brazilian cut underwear, etc. Absorbent articles of this invention may or may not<br>
include wings, flaps or tabs for securing the absorbent article to an undergarment.<br>
The absorbent article of the present invention includes a liquid permeable layer also<br>
referred to as a body facing layer. The exterior of the body facing layer forms the body-facing<br>
surface of the absorbent article. The body facing layer may be a single layer or be made from<br>
multiple layers. The body facing layer may be tormed from any fluid pervious material or<br>
combinations of materials that are comfortable against the skin and permits fluid to penetrate..<br>
For instance, the body facing layer may be a fibrous non-woven fabric made of fibers or<br>
filaments of polymers, such as polyethylene, polypropylene, polyester, or cellulose, and<br>
combinations thereof. Alternatively, the body facing layer may be formed from an apertured<br>
polymeric film. The thickness of the body facing layer may vary from about 0.001 inch (0.025<br>
mm) to about 0.200 inch (5,000 mm) depending on the material chosen. The weight of the body<br>
facing layer material is between about 5 to about 1 50 gsm<br>
For example, any material with cloth-like features may be used for the body facing layer.<br>
Such material include nonwoven materials, such as spunlace material, and woven materials. In<br><br>
particular, spunlace material made from the range of from 10 to 659? rayon and 35 to 90%<br>
polyester may be used.<br>
In one embodiment, the body facing layer is a single sheet of material having a width<br>
sufficient to form the body-facing surface of the absorbent article. In another embodiment, the<br>
body facing layer has at least two layers.<br>
The body facing layer, whether a single layer or multiple layers, may have absorbent<br>
capabilities, i.e., retains fluid. If a separate absorbent layer is used, the body facing layer may be<br>
longer and wider than the absorbent core or be of similar size as the absorbent core.<br>
The garment facing layer of the present invention may be pliant and is typically referred<br>
to as a backsheet or bander layer. The exterior of the garment facing layer forms the garment-<br>
facing surface of the absorbent article and. typically, is impermeable to fluids. In one<br>
embodiment, the garment facing layer may be any thin, flexible, fluid impermeable material,<br>
such as a polymeric film, e.g., polyethylene, polypropylene, of cellophane, or a normally fluid<br>
pervious material that has been treated to be impervious, such as impregnated fluid repellent<br>
paper or non-woven material, including non-woven fabric material, or a flexible foam, such as<br>
polyurethane or cross-linked polyethylene<br>
Additionally, the garment facing layer may be breathable, i.e., permits vapor to transpire.<br>
Known materials for this purpose include nonwoven materials and microporous films in which<br>
microporosity is created by, inter alia, stretching an oriented film. Single or multiple layers of<br>
permeable films, fabrics, melt-blown materials, and combinations thereof that provide a tortuous<br>
path, and/or whose surface characteristics provide a liquid surface repellent to the penetration of<br>
liquids may also be used to provide a breathable backsheet<br>
The thickness of the backsheet when formed from a polymeric film typically is about<br>
0.001 inch (0.025 mm) to about 0.002 inch (0.051 mm)<br>
One embodiment of the present invention includes an absorbent layer which may be a<br>
single layer or. alternately, be made of multiple layers. Absorbent materials used in the<br>
absorbent layer may include, but are not limited to, absorbent fibers, such as cellulose fibers,<br>
including, but not limited to wood pulp, regenerated cellulose fibers, and cotton fibers, rayon<br>
fibers and the like; superabsorbent fibers or particles: other naturally occuring absorbent<br>
materials, such as peat moss; and other synthetic absorbent materials, such as foams and the like.<br>
The absorbent layer may also include one or more of the following: thermoplastic binder fibers.<br><br>
latex binder, perfumes, or odor-controlling compounds or compositions. The absorbent layer<br>
may be compressed or uncompressed, embossed, or calendered. Additionally, the absorbent core<br>
may be made from any known absorbent bicomponent fibers, including those made., for example,<br>
from polyester, polyethylene, polypropylene and any combinations thereof<br>
The absorbent material ma\ be woven or nonwoven and made by any process known in<br>
the art. For example the absorbent material may be wet laid, carded, or air laid.<br>
Wings, also called, among other things, flaps or tabs, and their use in sanitary protection<br>
articles is described in U.S. Patent. No. 4,687,478 to Van Tilburg; U.S. Patent No. 4,589,876 also<br>
to Van Tilburg, U.S. Patent No. 4.900,320 to McCoy, and U.S. Patent No. 4.608,047 to<br>
Mattingly. The disclosures of these patents are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety<br>
As disclosed in the above documents, wings are generally speaking flexible and configured to be<br>
folded over the edges of the underwear so that the wings are disposed between the edges of the<br>
underwear.<br>
The shape of the wings may also be varied as desired. The wings may be rounded,<br>
rectangular, curvilinear, etc. The wings may be regular or irregular, symmetric or asymmetric in<br>
shape.<br>
The overall dimensions of the absorbent article ot the present invention may be as<br>
follows: a length of about 5 inches (127 mm) to 8 inches (203 mm) and a thickness of about 0.02<br>
inch (0.5 mm) to 0.2 inch (5 mm)<br>
Optionally, the absorbent article of the present invention may include a transfer or<br>
distribution layer. If included in the absorbent article the transfer layer may be made of any<br>
known material that will take up fluid and then distribute and release it to an adjacent absorbent<br>
layer for storage. Transfer layers have a relatively open structure that allows for movement of<br>
fluid within the layer. Suitable materials for such transfer layers include fibrous webs, resilient<br>
foams, and the like.<br>
The mass of materials making up the transfer layer may be absorbent, although the<br>
materials themselves are not absorbent. Thus, transfer layers that are made ot hydrophobic.<br>
nonabsorbent fibers may be able to accept large volumes of fluid into interfiber void spaces<br>
while the fibers themselves do not absorb any significant quantities of fluid. Likewise, open-<br>
celled foam structures that are made from nonabsorbent materials may also absorb fluid into the<br>
cells of the foam. The walls of the cells, however, do not absorb an\ fluid The cumulative<br><br>
spaces within the transfer layer. i.e, the interfiber void spaces in the fibrous transfer layer or the<br>
open cells in the foam transfer layer, function much like a container to hold fluid.<br>
Typically, transfer layer fibrous webs are made of resilient, nonabsorbent materials to<br>
provide void volume and to allow tor free movement of fluid through the structure. Transfer<br>
layers that are made from webs of mostly absorbent fibers absorb the fluid as it enters the<br>
structure and do not distribute it throughout the rest ot the structure as efficiently as webs<br>
containing non-absorbent materials.<br>
Adhesive is typically used to attach the layers into a single absorbent article. For<br>
example, in one embodiment, the body facing layer is attached to the barrier with adhesive HL<br>
1491 available from H.B Fuller and Company (St. Paul. MN) The adhesive may be applied in any<br>
method.<br>
Adhesive may also be applied to the garment lacing side of the absorbent article. For<br>
example, pressure sensitive adhesive strips, swirls, or waves may be applied to help maintain the<br>
absorbent article in place. As used herein, the term pressure-sensitive adhesive refers to any<br>
releasable adhesive or releasable tenacious means. Suitable adhesive compositions, include, for<br>
example, water-based pressure-sensitive adhesives such as acrylate adhesives. Alternatively, the<br>
adhesive composition may include adhesives based on the following: emulsion or solvent-borne<br>
adhesives of natural or synthetic polyisoprene, styrene-butadiene, or polyacrylate, vinyl acetate<br>
copolymer or combinations thereof: hot melt adhesives based on suitable block copoylmers -<br>
suitable block copolymers for use in the invention include linear or radial co-polymer structures<br>
having the formula (A-B)x wherein block A is a poly inylarene block, block B is a<br>
poly(monoalkenyl) block, x denotes the number of polymeric arms, and wherein x is an integer<br>
greater than or equal to one. Suitable block A poly inylarenes include, but are not limited to<br>
Polystyrene, Polyalpha-methylstyrene. Polyvinyltoluene. and combinations thereof. Suitable<br>
Block B poly(monoalkenyl) blocks include, but are not limited to conjugated diene elastomers<br>
such as for example polybutadiene or polyisoprene or hydrogenated elastomers such as ethylene<br>
butylene or ethylene propylene or polyisobutylene. or combinations thereof. Commercial<br>
examples of these types of block copolymers include KratonTM elastomers from Shell Chemical<br>
Company, Vector™ elastomers from Dexco, SolpreneTM from Enichem Elastomers and<br>
Stereon™ from Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co.: hot melt adhesive based on olefin polymers and<br>
copolymers where in the olefin polymer is a terpolymer ot ethylene and a co-monomers, such as<br><br>
vinyl acetate, acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, ethyl acrylate, methyl acrylate, n-butyl acrylate<br>
vinyl silane or maleic anhydride. Commercial examples of these types of polymers include<br>
Ateva( polymers from AT plastics), Nucrel( polymers from DuPont), Escor (from Exxon<br>
Chemical).<br>
Also useful in attaching absorbent articles of the present invention to the crotch of<br>
undergarments are mechanical attachment means, e.g., clips, laces, ties, and interlocking devices,<br>
e.g., snaps, buttons, VELCRO (Velcro USA, Inc., Manchester, NH), zipper, and the like.<br>
The absorbent article may be applied to the crotch of the undergarment or pants by<br>
placing the garment-facing surface against the inside surface of the crotch of the garment.<br>
A release strip may be applied to protect adhesive on the absorbent article prior to<br>
attaching the absorbent article to the crotch of an undergarment. The release strip can be formed<br>
from any suitable sheet-like material adheres with sufficient tenacity to the adhesive to remain in<br>
place prior to use but which can be readily removed when the absorbent article is to be used.<br>
Optionally , a coating may be applied to release strip to improve the ease of removabilty of the<br>
release strip from the adhesive. Any coating capable of achieving this result may be used, e.g.,<br>
silicone.<br>
Any or all of the cover, absorbent layer, transfer layer, backsheet layer, and adhesive<br>
layers may be colored. Such coloring includes, but is not limited to, white, black, red, yellow,<br>
blue, orange, green, violet, and mixtures thereof. Color may be imparted according the present<br>
invention though dying and/or pigmentation. Colorants used according the present invention<br>
include dyes and inorganic and organic pigments. The dyes include, but are not limited to, Azo<br>
dyes (e.g., Solvent Yellow 14, Disperse Yellow 23, Metanil Yellow), anthraquinone dyes<br>
(Solvent Red 111, Disperse Violet 1, Solvent Blue 56, and Solvent Green 3), Xanthene dyes<br>
(Solvent Green 4, Acid Red 52, Basic Red 1, and Solvent Orange 63), azine dyes (Jet black), and<br>
the like.<br>
Inorganic pigments include, but are not limited to, titanium dioxide (white), carbon black<br>
(black), iron oxides (red, yellow, and brown), chromium oxide (green), ferric ammonium<br>
ferrocyanide (blue), and the like.<br>
Organic pigments include, but are not limited to diarylide yellow AAOA (Pigment<br>
Yellow 12), diarylide yellow AAOT (Pigment Yellow 14), phthalocyanine blue (Pigment Blue<br>
15), lithol red (Pigment Red 49:1), Red Lake C (Pigment Red), and the like.<br><br>
The absorbent article may include other known materials, layers, and additives, such as,<br>
foam, net-like material, perfumes, medicaments or pharmaceutical agents, moisturizers, odor<br>
control agents, and the like. The absorbent article can optionally be embossed with decorative<br>
designs.<br>
The absorbent article may be packaged as unwrapped absorbent articles within a carton,<br>
box or bag. The consumer withdraws the ready-to-use article as needed. The absorbent article<br>
may also be individualh packaged (each absorbent article encased within an overwrap).<br>
Also contemplated herein include symmetrical absorbent articles having parallel<br>
longitudinal edges, dog bone or peanut-shaped, and the like.<br>
From the foregoing description, one skilled in the art can ascertain the essential<br>
characteristics of this invention, and without departing from the spirit and scope thereof, can<br>
make various changes and modifications. Embodiments set forth by way of illustration are not<br>
intended as limitations on the variations possible in practicing the present invention.<br>
EXAMPLE<br>
Samples of commercially available pantiliners were compared to samples of the present<br>
invention and samples from the crotch portion of an undergarment.<br>
Peak bending stiffness is determined by a test that is modeled after the ASTM D 4032-82<br>
CIRCULAR BEND PROCEDURE, the procedure being considerably modified and performed<br>
as follows The CIRCULAR BEND PROCEDURE is a simultaneous multi-directional<br>
deformation of a material in w hich one face of a specimen becomes concave and the other face<br>
becomes convex. The CIRCULAR BEND PROCEDURE gives a force value related to flexural<br>
resistance, simultaneous!) averaging stiffness in all directions.<br>
The apparatus necessary for the CIRCULAR BEND PROCEDURE is a modified<br>
Circular Bend Stiffness Tester having the following parts:<br>
1.	A smooth-polished steel plate platform, which is 102.0 mm by 102.0 by 6.35 mm<br>
having an 18.75 mm diameter orifice. The lap edge of the orifice should be at a 45<br>
degree angle to a depth of 4.75 mm:<br>
2.	A plunger having an overall length of 72.2 mm. a diameter of 6.25 mm, a ball nose<br>
having a radius of 2 97 mm and a needle-point extending 0.88 mm therefrom having a<br>
0. 33 mm base diameter and a point having a radius of less than 0.5 mm, the plunger<br>
being mounted concentric with the orifice and having equal clearance on all sides.<br><br>
Note that the needle-point is merely to prevent lateral movement of the test specimen<br>
during testing. Therefore, if the needle-point significantly adversely affects the test<br>
specimen (for example, punctures an inflatable structure), than the needle-point<br>
should not be used. The bottom of the plunger should be set well above the top of the<br>
orifice plate. From this position, the downward stroke of the ball nose is to the exact<br>
bottom of the plate orifice;<br>
3.	A force-measurement gauge and more specifically an lnstron inverted compression<br>
load cell. The load cell has a load range of from about 0.0 to about 2000.0 g;<br>
4.	An actuator and more specifically the lnstron Model No. 1122 having an inverted<br>
compression load cell. The lnstron 1 122 is made by the lnstron Engineering<br>
Corporation, Canton, Mass.<br>
In order to perform the procedure for this test, as explained below, five representative<br>
samples for each article are necessary. From each of the five samples to be tested, some number<br>
"Y" of 37.5 mm by 37.5 mm test specimens are cut. For undergarments, the crotch portion was<br>
made from at least one layer. For absorbent articles, test specimens were cut from anterior<br>
portion, the central portion, and the posterior portion This test is directed to the overall<br>
drapeability of the article and not merely the peripheral portions thereof and, therefore, the<br>
drapeability of the present invention is more concerned with the drapeability of the entire article<br>
than any specific portion thereof.<br>
The test specimens should not be folded or bent bv the test person, and the handling of<br>
specimens must be kept to a minimum and to the edges to avoid affecting flexural-resistance<br>
properties.<br>
The procedure for the CIRCULAR BEND PROCEDURE is as follows. The specimens<br>
are conditioned by leaving them in a room that is 21°C. +/- 0.1°C and 50%. + 2.0%, relative<br>
humidity for a period of two hours The plunger speed is set at 50.0 cm per minute per full<br>
stroke length. A specimen is centered on the orifice platform below the plunger such that the<br>
body facing layer of the specimen is lacing the plunger and the barrier layer of the specimen is<br>
facing the platform. The indicator zero is checked and adjusted, if necessarv The plunger is<br>
actuated. Touching the specimen during the testing should be avoided. The maximum force<br>
reading to the nearest gram is recorded. The above steps are repeated until all of the specimens<br>
have been tested.<br><br>
CALCULATIONS<br>
The peak bending stiffness for each specimen is me maximum force reading for that<br>
specimen. Remember that "Y" number of sets of five samples were oil. The values received for<br>
each specimen were averaged. The flexural resistance for an article is the average peak bending<br>
stiffnesses for all "Y" specimens taken from each sample of that article.<br><br>
