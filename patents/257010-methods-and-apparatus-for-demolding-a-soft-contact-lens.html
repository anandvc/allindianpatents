				<td>METHODS OF DEMOLDING OPHTHALMIC LENSES<br>
This invention related to methods for demolding ophthalmic lenses.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
Contact lenses have been used commercially to improve vision since the<br>
1950s. The first contact lenses were made of hard materials. Although these<br>
lenses are currently used, they are not suitable for all patients due to their poor<br>
initial comfort. Later developments in the field gave rise to soft contact lenses,<br>
based upon hydrogels, which are extremely popular today. These lenses have<br>
higher oxygen permeabilities and such are often more comfortable to wear than<br>
contact lenses made of hard materials. However, the beneficial physical<br>
properties of these lenses often present manufacturing problems, particularly<br>
when soft lenses are demolded.<br>
Many soft contact lenses are manufactured by a process where either<br>
partially polymerized or unpolymerized blends of components are placed<br>
between male and female mold parts and subsequently polymerized by either<br>
or both light and heat. Thereafter the polymerized lens is removed from the<br>
mold ("demolded") and processed in subsequent steps (hydration, removal of<br>
unreacted components and the like). In some cases either the male or the<br>
female mold part is demolded and subsequent processing steps are conducted<br>
with the polymerized lens sitting in or adhered to one the remaining mold part.<br>
Details these and other demolding process and subsequent steps may be<br>
found in the following publications U.S. Pat Nos. 5, 850,107; 5,080,839;<br>
5,039,459; 4,889,664, and 4,495,313, all of the foregoing publications are<br>
hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
When the lenses are demolded the pliable lenses can be damaged by<br>
the force used to remove either or both the male or female halves of the lens<br>
mold. Others have attempted to solve this problem by a variety of methods. In<br>
one such attempt, the male mold half is heated prior to the demolding step and<br>
subsequently removed. See, U.S. Pat. No. 6,663,801 which is hereby<br>
incorporated by reference. Even though this method is effective, it does not<br>
work with all types of soft contact lenses and it would be advantageous to have<br><br>
additional methods of demolding contact lens molds. This need is met by the<br>
following invention.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
Figure 1 is a graph of showing the number of lenses that remained with the<br>
female mold part for cooled and non-cooled demold processes.<br>
Figure 2 is a graph showing the number of defects demolded lenses that were<br>
cooled and heated prior to demolding.<br>

preferred lenses include but are not limited to galifilcon A, senofilcon A, and<br>
lenses disclosed in U.S. Pat. App. No. 60/318,536, entitled Biomedical Devices<br>
Containing Internal wetting Agents," filed on September 10, 2001 and its non-<br>
provisional counterpart of the same title, U.S. Serial No. 10/236,538, filed on<br>
September 6, 2002.<br>
"Lens mold assembly," refers a combination of three components, a<br>
male mold, a female mold and a cured lens. The male and female molds may<br>
be made from a variety of components such as plastics, metals and glass. The<br>
preferred molds are plastics. Examples of such plastics include but are not<br>
limited to materials disclosed in U.S. Pat. App. No. 10/639,823, filed on August<br>
13,2003 entitled "Molds for Producing Contact Lenses," which is incorporated<br>
by reference in its entirety. Other mold materials are polymers copolymers,<br>
homopolymers and block co-polymers of polystyrene, polypropylene, and<br>
polyethylene. Examples of plastic molds are disclosed in the following<br>
documents which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety, U.S.<br>
Pat Nos. 5,094,609; 4,565,348; and 4,640, 489. The male and female mold<br>
need not be of the same material. For example a lens mold assembly having a<br>
female mold made of a polypropylene and a male mold made of an alicyclic co-<br>
polymer of norbonene may be used. The particularly preferred mold material is<br>
an alicyclic co-polymer that contains two different alicyclic monomers and is<br>
sold by Zeon Chemicals L.P. under the tradename ZEONOR. There are<br>
several different grades of ZEONOR, having of glass transition temperatures<br>
form 105-160°C. The particularly preferred ZEONOR, is ZEONOR 1060R,<br>
which according the to the manufacturer, ZEON Chemicals L.P. has an melt<br>
flow rate ("MFR") range of 11 ;0 grams/10 minutes to 18.0 grams/10 minutes<br>
(as tested JISK 6719 (230°C)), a specific gravity (H20 =1) of 1.01 and a glass<br>
transition temperature of 105°C.<br>
As used herein "cooling" refers to any method of reducing the<br>
temperature of the lens mold assembly. In the process of curing ophthalmic<br><br>
lenses, the lens mold assembly is heated and subjected to radiation. When<br>
this assembly leaves the curing portion of the manufacturing process, the<br>
temperature of the assembly is about 50 to about 70°C. This heated lens mold<br>
assembly is cooled by one of the methods described below and prior to<br>
demolding. It is preferred that the lens mold assembly be cooled to a<br>
temperature of about 0°C to about less than 45°C, more preferably about 3 °C<br>
to less than about 30°C.<br>
One method of cooling the lens mold assembly is to blow compressed<br>
air on the lens mold assembly where the temperature of the forced air is about<br>
-40°C to about +5°C and the rate of air flow (standard cubic feet per minutes,<br>
"SCFM") is about 5 SCFM to about 100 SCFM, preferably about 18 SCFM.<br>
The forced air can be directed at the entire lens mold assembly or a particular<br>
part of the lens mold assembly. For example, forced air may be directed at<br>
either the female mold's non-molding surface (convex surface) or the male<br>
mold's non-molding surface (concave surface). When using the forced air<br>
method it is preferred that the forced air is directed to the concave surface of<br>
the male mold.<br>
Another method of cooling the lens mold assembly is to blow solid CO2<br>
particles on the lens assembly. The temperature of those particles is about -60<br>
to about -0°C, preferably about -50°C. Those particles are discharged at a rate<br>
of about 0.5 SCFM to about 10 SCFM, preferably about 3 SCFM. Solid CO2<br>
may be directed to the entire lens mold assembly or a portion thereof. It is<br>
preferred that the solid CO2 be directed to the non-molding surface of the male<br>
mold. Other methods of cooling the lens mold assembly include but are not<br>
limited to allowing the assembly to come to room temperature, placing the<br>
assembly in a refrigerated chamber, placing the assembly in the proximity of a<br>
thermoelectric chiller or a cool liquid, such as ice water. The preferred methods<br>
of cooling are using forced cold air or solid CO2 particles.<br>
As used herein the term "heating" refers to any method of elevating the<br>
temperature of the lens mold assembly including but not limited to applying<br>
steam, forced hot air, or heat to the lens mold assembly. Examples of such<br>
heating methods may be found in the following references EP 775,571; EP<br>
686,487; U.S. Pat. App. No. 2002/0145,211; U.S. Pat Nos. 5,820,895;<br><br>
6,171,529; 5,850,107; 5,294,379; 5,935,492; and 5,770,119, all of these<br>
references are incorporated by reference in their entirety. Either the entire lens<br>
mold assembly may be heated or a portion thereof. One method of heating the<br>
lens mold assembly uses a silicon carbide infra-red emitter and is disclosed in<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 6,663,801. If this heating method is used the heat is applied to<br>
the non-molding surface of either the male or the female mold part. It is<br>
particularly preferred that heat is applied to the non-molding surface of the male<br>
mold.<br>
After the male mold of the lens mold assembly is heated, the male mold<br>
may be demolded using shims, pry fingers, or other types of mechanical<br>
leverage. See, EP 775,571; EP 686,487; U.S. Pat. App. No. 2002/0145,211;<br>
U.S. Pat Nos. 5,820,895; 6,171,529; 5,850,107; 5,294,379; 5,935,492; and<br>
5,770,119 for experimental details. In addition to or instead of the mechanical<br>
leverage, the male molds may be removed by applying a vacuum to the male<br>
molds to demold it. It is preferred that a combination of mechanical means and<br>
vacuum is used to demold the male mold member.<br>
The methods of this invention have many advantages. Most ophthalmic<br>
lenses are made in a manufacturing environment where speed from processing<br>
station to processing station is important. Using the cooling and subsequent<br>
heating steps of this invention significantly shorten the period of time between<br>
the exit of the lens from the curing area and demolding of the lens. It is<br>
preferred that the period of time between removing the lens from the curing<br>
area and demolding the lens be less than about 20 seconds, preferably less,<br>
than about 15, seconds, more preferably less than about 10 seconds.<br>
A further advantage of the invention is that by cooling and subsequently<br>
heating either the male or the female mold member, one can remove the<br>
heated mold and leave the lens sitting in or adhered to the non-heated mold<br>
part. This is an advantage because some manufacturing processes require<br>
that subsequent processing steps (hydration, excess monomer removal, and<br>
the like) are conducted in either the male or female lens mold.<br>
Another advantage of this invention is that fewer of the ophthalmic<br>
lenses are damaged by the demolding process. This is demonstrated by the<br>
reduced number of demolded lenses with mold related defects such as tears,<br><br>
chips, surface marks, surface tears. When ophthalmic lenses made of galificon<br>
A are demolded by removing the lenses from the curing area and heating the<br>
male mold member as described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,663,801, the lenses have<br>
approximately 30-70% percent of the lenses have mold related defects. When<br>
ophthalmic lenses are cooled with cooled air or solid CO2 particles and<br>
subsequently heated prior to demolding, about 10-15% of those lenses have<br>
mold related defects.<br>
In addition the invention includes an apparatus suitable for cooling and<br>
heating a lens mold assembly prior to demolding the assembly comprising,<br>
consisting essentially of, or consisting of a cooling component and a heating<br>
component. The terms cooling, heating lens mold assembly, and demolding all<br>
have their aforementioned meanings and preferred ranges. The preferred<br>
cooling components are cold forced air blowers or solid CO2 blowers. The<br>
preferred heating components are infra-red heaters.<br>
In order to illustrate the invention the following examples are included.<br>
These examples do not limit the invention. They are meant only to suggest a<br>
method of practicing the invention. Those knowledgeable in the production of<br>
lenses as well as other specialties may find other methods of practicing the<br>
invention. However, those methods are deemed to be within the scope of this<br>
invention.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
Demolding Using Forced Air<br>
Example 1<br>
Due to the constraints of the downstream processing steps it was<br>
desirable for the male mold member to be removed from the cured lens<br>
assembly and for the cured lens to remain with the female mold member. This<br>
example evaluates whether the cured lenses remain with the female mold<br>
member after demold.<br>
The uncured monomer used to prepare galifilcon A was placed between<br>
a male and a female mold halves made of Zeonor and cured as describe in<br>
U.S. Pat App. No. 60/318,536 and U.S. Serial No. 10/236,538. The<br><br>
temperature of the cured lens mold assembly was approximately 65°C. The<br>
concave surface of the male molding member was heated with a silicon infra-<br>
red heater and demolded as described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,663,801. Some lens<br>
mold assemblies were cooled by blowing cold air (-40°C, 18 SCFM) on the<br>
concave surface of the male mold for 2,3,4, or 8 seconds. The cooled lens<br>
assembly was heated with a silicon infra-red heater and demolded as<br>
described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,663,801. The demolded lenses were evaluated to<br>
determine if they remained with the female mold member. The results are<br>
presented in Figure 1. This figure shows that without cooling prior to demold<br>
less than 5% of the lenses remain with the female mold member.<br>
Demolding Using Solid CO2<br>
Example 2<br>
This example evaluates defects in the cured lenses due to demolding. The<br>
uncured monomer used to prepare galifilcon A was placed between a male and<br>
a female mold halves made of Zeonor and cured as describe in U.S. Pat App.<br>
No. 60/318,536, and U.S. Serial No. 10/236,538. The temperature of the<br>
cured lens mold assembly was approximately 65°C. Lens mold assemblies<br>
were cooled by blowing solid CO2 (-50°C, 3 SCFM) on the concave surface of<br>
the male mold for about 2 seconds. The cooled lens assembly was heated with<br>
a silicon infra-red heater and demolded as described in U.S. Pat. No.<br>
6,663,801. All of the demolded lenses remained with the female mold member.<br>
These lenses were evaluated to determine how many mold related defects<br>
such as tears, surface marks/tears, strings, and debris are found in the<br>
demolded lenses. The results are presented in Figure 2. This figure shows<br>
that using the cooling demolding technique yields that have only 15% mold<br>
related defects (tears, surface mark/tears). This number is lower than the<br>
amount of mold related defects that are present (30-70%) when cooling is not<br>
used.<br><br>
