				<td>This application claims priority from Japanese Patent Application No. 2007-299941 filed November 19, 2007, the entire contents of which are herein incorporated by reference.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
The present invention relates to a rear vehicle body structure, and more particularly, to a rear vehicle body structure including a cross member disposed between a luggage compartment and a rear seat to prevent a luggage from moving into a passenger compartment from the luggage compartment; a wheel house inner panel forming a wheel house together with a wheel house outer panel to house a rear wheel and including a peripheral wall which is provided along a circumferential direction of the rear wheel and a vertical wall which is directed toward an inner side of the peripheral wall in a radial direction of the peripheral wall from an inner side portion of the peripheral wall in a width direction of a vehicle", and a rear pillar reinforcement disposed above the wheel house inner panel.<br>
There is a structure disclosed in Patent Document 1 as an example of the rear vehicle body structure. In this structure, joint portions provided at left and right ends of a cross member overlapped with left and right ends of a flat vertical plate-like partition front panel, which is positioned on the rear side of a rear seat, from the front side of a vehicle, respectively, and were<br>
fixed to the left and right ends of the partition front panel by bolts.<br>
Patent Document l:    Japanese Utility Model Publication No. 60-78674A<br>
According to the structure in the related art, only one joint portion is provided at each of the left and right ends of the cross member. Since the strength of the partition front panel to which the joint portions are joined is not sufficient, it was difficult to increase joint strength between the cross member and a vehicle body.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
It is therefore an object of the invention to provide a rear vehicle body structure that can increase joint strength between a cross member and a vehicle body and reliably prevent luggage from moving into a passenger compartment.<br>
According to an aspect of an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, there is provided a rear vehicle body structure, comprising: a cross member disposed between a luggage compartment and a rear seat to prevent a luggage from moving into a passenger compartment from the luggage compartment; a wheel house inner panel forming a wheel house together with a wheel house outer panel to house a rear wheel and including a peripheral wall which is provided along a circumferential direction of the rear wheel and a vertical wall which is directed toward an inner side of the<br>
peripheral wall in a radial direction of the peripheral wall from an inner side portion of the peripheral wall in a width direction of a vehicle; a rear pillar reinforcement disposed above the wheel house inner panel; and a mounting bracket fixing the cross member to a vehicle body and including a first joint portion which is joined to the vertical wall of the wheel house inner panel and a second joint portion which is joined to the rear pillar reinforcement.<br>
With this structure, the mounting bracket includes a plurality of joint portions, and the first joint portion of the joint portions is joined to the vertical wall of the wheel house inner panel, and a second joint portion thereof is joined to the rear pillar reinforcement. Accordingly, for example, as compared to a structure where a single joint portion provided at a mounting bracket is joined to a single member such as the partition front panel, it is possible to increase the joint strength of the mounting bracket. The rear pillar reinforcement is a member having high strength and the second joint portion of the mounting bracket is joined to this member, so that it is possible to further increase the joint strength of the second joint portion. In this manner, the rear pillar reinforcement can be effectively utilized for increasing the joint strength of the mounting bracket without providing new reinforcing members. Therefore, it is possible to stably support the cross member on the vehicle body, and to reliably prevent luggage from moving into a passenger compartment by the cross member.<br>
The rear vehicle body structure may further comprise an absorber reinforcement to which a shock absorber of a rear suspension is mounted, the<br>
absorber reinforcement overlapping with and being joined to the peripheral wall and the vertical wall of the wheel house inner panel from a side of the rear wheel, and the first joint portion of the mounting bracket may overlap with and be joined to the vertical wall of the wheel house inner panel from an opposite side to the absorber reinforcement so that the vertical wall is interposed between the first joint portion and the absorber reinforcement.<br>
The absorber reinforcement is a member having high strength. The first joint portion overlaps with and is joined to the vertical wall of the wheel house inner panel, to which the absorber reinforcement is joined to increase strength. Therefore, it is possible to further increase the joint strength of the first joint portion.<br>
The first joint portion of the mounting bracket may overlap with and be joined to the peripheral wall of the wheel house inner panel from the opposite side to the absorber reinforcement so that the peripheral wall is interposed between the first joint portion and the absorber reinforcement.<br>
The absorber reinforcement is a member having high strength. The first joint portion overlaps with and is joined to the peripheral wall of the wheel house inner panel to which the absorber reinforcement is joined to increase strength. Therefore, it is possible to further increase the joint strength of the first joint portion.<br>
The rear pillar reinforcement may have a rectangular cross-section<br>
so that the rear pillar reinforcement includes a front wall which faces a longitudinal direction of the vehicle and is provided on a front side of the vehicle and a side wall which extends toward a rear side of the vehicle from an inner side portion of the front wall in the width direction of the vehicle,' and the second joint portion of the mounting bracket may have an L-shaped cross-section so that one piece of the second joint portion is joined to the front wall of the rear pillar reinforcement from the front side of the vehicle and the other piece of the second joint portion is joined to the side wall of the rear pillar reinforcement from the inner side in the width direction of the vehicle.<br>
With this structure, joint directions where one piece and the other piece of the second joint portion are joined to the rear pillar reinforcement intersect each other. As compared to when the second joint portion is joined to the rear pillar reinforcement only in one direction, it is possible to increase the joint strength between the rear pillar reinforcement and the second joint portion.<br>
A joint portion of the mounting bracket may be disposed in an inner side of a corner portion in the width direction of the vehicle, the corner portion which is formed by the peripheral wall and the vertical wall of the wheel house inner panel.<br>
Since the corner portion having high rigidity may receive a force that is applied to the joint portion of the mounting bracket, it is possible to stably support the cross member on the vehicle body through the mounting bracket.<br>
According to the aspect of the exemplary embodiment of the present invention, it is possible to provide the rear vehicle body structure that can increase the joint strength between the cross member and the vehicle body and reliably prevent the luggage from moving into the passenger compartment.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS<br>
A preferred embodiment of the invention will be described below with reference to drawings. A rear vehicle body structure of an automobile is shown in Figs. 1 and 2. The rear vehicle body structure includes a partition panel 3 that partitions a passenger compartment 1 of a vehicle and a luggage<br>
compartment 2 formed at the rear portion of a vehicle body? a cross member 4 that is positioned between the luggage compartment 2 and a rear seat 9 to prevent luggage from moving into the passenger compartment 1 from the luggage compartment 2; wheel house inner panels 5 that form wheel houses together with wheel house outer panels to house rear wheels; and rear pillar reinforcements 6 that are positioned over the wheel house inner panels 5 to reinforce rear pillars and the wheel house inner panels 5, and receive forces from shock absorbers and transmit the forces to the rear pillars.<br>
As shown in Figs. 3 and 4, mounting brackets 7 that fixes the cross member 4 to a vehicle body 8 are provided, so that both ends of the cross member 4 in the longitudinal direction of the cross member are mounted to the vehicle body 8 by the pair of (left and right) mounting brackets 7 and the both ends of the cross member 4 is supported by the vehicle body 8.<br>
[Structure of partition panel 3]<br>
The partition panel 3 includes a vertical plate like partition front panel 10 that is positioned on the rear side of the rear seat 9, and a horizontal plate-like partition rear panel 11 that extends from the upper end of the partition front panel 10 toward the rear side of the vehicle. The partition front panel 10 has a large opening opened in the longitudinal direction of a vehicle, and the opening is closed by a partition board 12 that is made of a resin. A partition member 40, which has an L-shaped cross-section, is welded to the rear surfaces of the partition front panel 10 and   the   partition   rear  panel   11.      Accordingly,   a   member   having   a<br>
cross-section where corners of the partition panel 3 are closed is formed. Further, left and right ends of the partition front panel 10 are welded to the surfaces of front walls 22 of the rear pillar reinforcements 6 to be described below.<br>
[Structure of cross member 4]<br>
The cross member 4 is formed using a metal plate of which the surface faces the longitudinal direction of the vehicle and which is long in a width direction of a vehicle, and is pressed to be concave and convex. Concave and convex portions of the cross member 4 from a U shape in vertical cross-section (see Fig. 2), and each of the concave and convex portions is continued over the entire length of the cross member 4. As shown in Fig. 1, reinforcements 13, which are formed in a concave and convex shape so as to correspond to the concave and convex portions of the cross member 4, overlap with both ends of the cross member 4 in the longitudinal direction of the cross member, and are welded to both ends of the cross member. Further, a plurality of bolt insertion holes 15 is formed at the overlapping portions thereof (see Fig. 2). Since the cross member 4 is formed by pressing the metal plate as described above, it is possible to reduce the number of parts, for example, as compared to when the cross member 4 is formed using two crossing pipes.<br>
[Structure of wheel house inner panel 5]<br>
The wheel house inner panel 5 includes a peripheral wall 16 that has a circular arc shape in side view and is formed along a circumferential<br>
direction of a rear wheel, and a vertical wall 17 that is formed toward the inner side of the peripheral wall 16 in a radial direction of the peripheral wall from a side portion of the peripheral wall 16 corresponding to the inner side Wl in the width direction of the vehicle. A corner portion 18, which is formed by the peripheral wall 16 and the vertical wall 17, is formed to have a circular arc shape in cross-sectional view. Further, as shown in Figs. 2 to 4, one plate-like absorber reinforcement 19 to which the shock absorber of a rear suspension is mounted overlaps with the rear surfaces of the peripheral wall 16 and the vertical wall 17 of the wheel house inner panel 5 from the side of the rear wheel, and is welded to the rear surfaces.<br>
The absorber reinforcement 19 is bent so as to correspond the shapes of the rear surfaces of the peripheral wall 16, the vertical wall 17, and the corner portion 18. A mounting portion 20 of the shock absorber is formed at the upper portion of the wheel house inner panel 5. A swollen portion 17B, which is swollen toward the inner side Wl in the width direction of the vehicle, is formed in the middle portion of the vertical wall 17 in the longitudinal direction of the vehicle so that the vertical wall 17 does not interfere with the shock absorber.<br>
[Structure of rear pillar reinforcement 6]<br>
As shown in Fig. 3, the rear pillar reinforcement 6 is formed in a rectangular cross-sectional shape including a front wall 22 of which the surface faces the longitudinal direction of the vehicle and which is provided on the front side Fr of the vehicle, a side wall 23 that extends toward the rear<br>
side of the vehicle from a side portion of the front wall 22 corresponding to the inner side Wl in the width direction of the vehicle, and a rear wall 24 that extends toward the outer side W2 in the width direction of the vehicle from a side portion of the side wall 23 corresponding to the rear side of the vehicle.<br>

Accordingly, the rear pillar reinforcement 6 is formed to have a hat shaped cross-section which is opened to the outer side W2 in the width direction of the vehicle. Further, the rear pillar reinforcement 6 is set to have a width as large as the width of the lower end in the longitudinal direction of a vehicle and the width direction of the vehicle, and is inclined so as to be positioned on the rear side of the vehicle toward the upper end.<br>
Further, a flange portion 22F1, which protrudes from the lower end of the front wall 22 toward the front side Fr of the vehicle, overlaps with the peripheral wall 16 from the side opposite to the absorber reinforcement 19 so that the peripheral wall 16 of the wheel house inner panel 5 is interposed between the flange portion and the absorber reinforcement.    The flange<br>
portion 22F1, the peripheral wall 16, and the absorber reinforcement 19 are integrally welded to one another, and the flange portion 22F2, which protrudes toward the front side of the vehicle from the side portion of the front wall 22 corresponding to the outer side W2 in the width direction of the vehicle, is welded to a quarter panel 45 (see Fig. 1).<br>
As shown in Figs. 2 and 3, a notch 25, which is opened downward, is formed at the lower end of the side wall 23. The lower end of the side wall 23, which is positioned closer to the rear side of the vehicle as compared to the notch 25, extends toward the vertical wall 17 of the wheel house inner panel 6. The notch 25 reaches a side portion of the side wall 23 that corresponds to the front side Fr of the vehicle.<br>
Further, a flange portion 24F1 (see Figs. 2 and 4), which protrudes from the lower end of the rear wall 24 toward the rear side of the vehicle, overlaps with the peripheral wall 16 from the side opposite to the absorber reinforcement 19 so that the peripheral wall 16 of the wheel house inner panel 5 is interposed between the flange portion and the absorber reinforcement.
