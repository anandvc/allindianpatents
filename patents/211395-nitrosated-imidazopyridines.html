The additional epoxidation compared with scheme 1. is likewise carried out in a manner known per se,*.<br>
for example using hydrogen peroxide as an epoxidizing agent. Alternatively to schemes 1 and 2,'th,e'"i'i<br>
compounds where X = NH can also be prepared according to scheme 8 of international patent<br>
application WO98/42707, advantageously with protection of the hydroxy group of the phenylisoserine '<br>
ester, for example using a suitable silyl group, or - if compounds where R5a/R5b = H are desired -<br>
using the corresponding propionic acid derivative without a 2-hydroxy group.	<br>
While compounds 1 where X = O, R4a or R4b = hydroxyl, R5a/R5b = H and any desired substituents<br>
R3a and R3b can be prepared in analogy to scheme 1, compounds where X = O, R4a or R4b =    .'<br>

The above scheme 3 shows, by way of example, the enantioselective synthesis of a 7(J8-diol (R4a or ' R4b and R5a or R5b are in each case hydroxyl), which, if desired, can then additionally be alkylated or its hydroxy groups can additionally be derivatized in a suitable manner (e.g. etherified or converted into the groups R41/R51 or R42/R52).<br>
The group Y in scheme 3 is a suitable leaving group, for example a halogen atom, preferably chlorine,<br>
"*'	II<br>
or a 1-4C alkoxy group, preferably methoxy. The acylation is carried out in the manner customary to<br>
the person skilled in the art, preferably using bis(trimethylsilyl)sodamide or potassamide if the leaving<br>
group is a chlorine atom.<br><br>
The oxidation following the acylation is likewise carried out under conditions which are! customary per<br>
se, using chloranil, atmospheric oxygen, 2,3-dichloro-5,6-dicyano-p-benzoquinone or manganese <br><br>

conditions are to be fulfilled with respect to the auxiliary acid to be used. Formic acid is advantageous);<br>
employed as an auxiliary acid.	.	<br><br>
The reduction to the diol is likewise carried out - as already in the case of the reduction according to   scheme 2 - under standard conditions (see, for example, W098/54188), sodium borohydride, for example, being employed as a reductant, with the use of which the specified 7,8-trans diol can be '.<br>
obtained in over 90% diastereomeric purity. The etherification which follows, if desired! ancj js likewise;<br>

carried out in a manner customary per se, leads to the compounds of the formula 1* according to the<br>
	'   '<br><br>
invention in which R4a and R5b are hydrogen.	||<br>
■•  .. i<br>
For the preparation of compounds of the formula 1 in which R5a and R5b are hydrogen, instead of-the dioxolane in scheme 3, starting materials to be used are 3-hydroxypropionic acid derivatives (correspondingly protected on the hydroxy group) in which Y (analogously to the above scheme) is'a  , suitable leaving group.!<br>
The introduction of the "prodrug" radical R' subsequently, to the synthesis for the formation of the '<br>
substituents R41 or R51 carried out according to schemes 1 to 3 is carried out in the sense of an *<br>
acylation reaction starting from compounds of the formula 1 in which at least one of the radicals R4a,;';<br>
R4b, R5a and R5b is a hydroxy group, by reaction with compounds of the formula R'-Z in which Z is a<br>
suitable leaving group, for example a halogen atom. The reaction is carried out in a manner known per<br>
se, preferably in the presence of a suitable auxiliary base. For the preparation of the compounds of the<br>
formula 1 in which R4a or R4b is 1-4C-alkoxy or 1-4C-alkoxy-1-4C-alkoxy and R5a or R5b is the	<br>
radical R5', compounds of the formula 1 in which R4a or R4b is 1-4C-alkoxy or 1-4C-alkoxy-1-4C-<br>
alkoxy and R5a or R5b is hydroxyl are reacted with compounds R'-Z. For the preparation of the	<br>
compounds of the formula 1 in which R4a or R4b is hydroxyl and R5a or R5b is the radical R5',<br>
compounds of the formula 1 in which R4a and R4b together are 0 (oxygen) and R5a or R5b is    J<br>
li	&gt;<br>
hydroxyl are reacted with compounds R'-Z. The keto group is then reduced to the hydroxy group. In a <br>
similar manner, compounds of the formula 1 are obtained in which the "prodrug" radical is in the        <br>
7-position and the hydroxy group or the 1-4C-alkoxy ori'1-4C-alkoxy-1-4C-alkoxy radical is in the<br>
8-position.<br>
The alkylation of the compounds obtained according to schemes 1 to 3 to give the compounds of the ! formula 1 in which R4a, R4b, R5a or R5b has the meaning 1-7C-alkyl, 2-7C-alkenyl, phenyl or pheh-1-4C-alkyl can generally be carried out according to schemes 4 and 5 below.<br><br><br>

The introduction of the radical R5a or R5b (abbreviated to R5) in the 8-position is carried out, for   '.<br>
example, by reaction with a suitable halide (Hal = halogen), such as, for example, methyl iodide," benzyl<br>
bromide etc., under suitable, preferably basic conditions in a manner known per se. Advantageously, .»,<br>
the reaction can also be carried out under phase-transfer conditions. The alkylated product'obtained*-!'.<br>
can then be reacted further, if desired, as described or in a manner known per se (reduction of the<br>
7-oxo group, etherification, introduction of a "prodrug" radical etc.).	With regard to the specific preparation and isolation of the pure enantiomers, reference is made, for<br>
example, to the corresponding details in WOOO/17200.	j;<br><br><br>
The starting compounds shown in schemes 1 to 3 are known (see, for example, EP-A--299470,  <br>
Kaminski et al., J. Med. Chem. 1985, 28, 876-892, 1989, 32, 1686-1700 and 1991, 34!'533-541 and<br>
Angew. Chem. 1996, 108, 589-591) or they can be prepared in a manner analogous to the known <br>
compounds, for example according to reaction scheme 6 below.	<br>

The reactions to give the 8-benzyloxy-6-bromoimidazopyridines are carried out in a manner such as is<br>
known to the person skilled in the art. The conversion of the bromine atom into an ethyl ester radical<br>
can be carried out in various ways, for example using the Heck reaction (using Pd(ll), carbon monoxic<br>
and ethanol) or by metallation in the 6-position (using lithium or magnesium) and subsequent Grignarc<br><br>
reaction. The metallation also offers the possibility of introducing other desired groups<br><br>
R3b in position<br><br>
6, for example fluorine, chlorine or the carboxy group. Starting from the ester group, further desired'<br><br>
groups R3b can be introduced into position 6, for example hydroxy-1-4C-aikyl radicals hydroxymethyl radical), by reduction of the ester radical with lithium aluminum hydride<br>
(in particularity<br>
or 1 -4C-alkoxy: 1-4C-alkyl radicals (in particular 1-4C-alkoxymethyl radicals) by subsequent etherificatjpn as outlined i scheme 6.<br>
The debenzylation/reduction is likewise carried out in a manner known per se, for example using    , hydrogen/Pd(0). If compounds where R3b = -CO-NR31R32 are desired, an appropriate derivatization can be performed in a manner known per se (conversion of an ester into an amide) atithe stage of the 8-benzyloxy-6-ethoxycarbonyl compound or after the debenzylation/reduction, or alternatively also at i later point in time, e.g. at the stage of the acyloin (see schemes 2 and 3).<br>
Starting compounds having various substituents R1 and R2 are known, or they can be prepared - for<br><br>
example based on scheme 6 - in a known manner in analogy to known compounds. Alternatively, '•*<br>
derivatizations can also be carried out at the stage of the compounds 1. It is thus possible, for example<br>
starting from compounds where R2 = H, to prepare compounds where R2 = CH2OH (by Vilsmeier .,<br>
reaction and subsequent reduction), where R2 = CI or Br (by chlorination or bromination), where R2 =<br>
propynyl (from the corresponding bromo compound using the Sonogashira reaction) or where R2 ='•<br>
alkoxycarbonyl (from the corresponding bromo compound by Heck carbonylation).<br>
The following examples serve to illustrate the invention in greater detail without restricting it. Likewise, further compounds of the formula 1 whose preparation is not described explicitly can be prepared in a analogous manner or in a manner familiar per se to the person skilled in the art using customary process techniques. The abbreviation min stands for minute(s), h for hour(s) and ee for "enantiomeric excess".<br><br><br>

In addition, the excellent activity of compounds of the formula 1ai<br>
against Helicobacter bacteria allows their use in human medicine as active compound treatment of illnesses which are based on Helicobacter«-bacteria.<br>
"Gastric and intestinal protection" in this connection is understood as meaning the pre treatment of gastrointestinal diseases, in particular of gastrointestinal inflammatory dis lesions (such as, for example, gastric ulcer, peptic ulcerj, including peptic ulcer bleedin ulcer, gastritis, hyperacidic or medicament-related functional dyspepsia), which can be example, by microorganisms (e.g. Helicobacter pylori),' bacterial toxins, medicaments i antiinflammatories and antirheumatics, such as NSAIDs and COX-inhibitors), chemica gastric acid or stress situations. "Gastric and intestinal protection" is understood to inc to general knowledge, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), the symptoms of whi are not limited to, heartburn and/or acid regurgitation.<br>
In their excellent properties, the compounds according to the invention surprisingly pre superior to the compounds known from the prior art in various models in which the ant the antisecretory properties are determined. On account of these properties, the comp formula 1 and their pharmacologically tolerable salts are outstandingly suitable for use veterinary medicine, where they are used, in particular, for the treatment and/or proph disorders of the stomach and/or intestine.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
The invention therefore further relates to a process for the treatment of mammals, in p who are suffering from illnesses which are based on hyperacidity of the stomach and/c of Helicobacter bacteria. The process comprises administering to the sick individual a<br><br><br>
efficacious and pharmacologically tolerable amount of one or more compounds of the I their pharmacologically tolerable salts.<br><br>
The invention moreover relates to the compounds of the formula 1 and their pharmaco tolerable salts for use in the treatment of illnesses which are based on hyperacidity of 1 and/or the presence of Helicobacter bacteria.<br>

The medicaments are prepared by processes which are known per se and familiar to in the art. As medicaments, the pharmacologically active compounds (= active compo to the invention are employed either as such, or preferably in combination with suitabh excipients or vehicles in the form of tablets, coated tablets, capsules, suppositories, p TTS), emulsions, suspensions or solutions, the active compound content advantages between 0.1 and 95% and it being possible by the appropriate choice of the excipients obtain a pharmaceutical administration form exactly suited to the active compound am<br><br><br><br>
desired onset of action and/or to the duration of action (e.g. a delayed-release form or<br><br><br>
The person skilled in the art is familiar on the basis .'of, his/her expert knowledge with e vehicles which are suitable for the desired pharmaceutical formulations. In addition to formers, suppository bases, tablet excipients and other active compound carriers, it is for example, antioxidants, dispersants, emulsifiers, antifoams, flavor corrigents, presei solubilizers, colorants or in particular permeation promoters and complexing agents (e cyclodextrins).<br>
The active compounds can be administered orally, parenterally or percutaneously.<br>
In general, it has proven advantageous in human medicine to administer the active coi case of oral administration in a daily dose of approximately 0.01 to approximately 20, p 5, in particular 0.1 to 1.5, mg/kg of body weight, if appropriate in the form of a number to 4, individual doses to achieve the desired result. In the case of parenteral treatment particular in the case of intravenous administration of the active compounds) as a rule be used. Any person skilled in the art can easily fix the optimum dose and manner of i the active compounds necessary in each case on the basis of his/her expert knowledc<br>
If the compounds according to the invention and/or their Walts are to be employed for t the abovementioned illnesses, the pharmaceutical preparations can also contain one c pharmacologically active constituents of other pharmaceutical groups. Examples whicl mentioned are: tranquillizers (for example from the group consisting of the benzodiaze diazepam), spasmolytics (e.g. bietamiverine or camylofin), anticholinergics (e.g. oxyph phencarbamide), local anesthetics (e.g. tetracaine orprocaine), and optionally also en; or amino acids.<br><br>
In particular to be emphasized in this connection is the combination of the compounds invention with pharmaceuticals which inhibit acid secretion, such as, for example, H2 b cimetidine, ranitidine) or H+/K+ ATPase inhibitors (e.g. omeprazole, lansoprazole, rab
