				<td>A method of diagnosing or prognosticating HIV infection in a subject<br>
Technical field of the invention.<br>
The present invention concerns the diagnosis and/or prognosis of HIV infection. More particular it concerns the measurements of the concentration of soluble urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (suPAR) in human biological fluids (sputum, cystic fluid, ascites, serum, plasma, urine) as a tool of diagnosing HIV infection as well as the prognosis of disease progression.<br>
Background of the invention.<br>
The cellular receptor for urokinase (uPAR, CD87) plays multiple functions in cell migration, cell adhesion, pericellular proteolysis and tissue remodeling [Blasi, 1997]. uPAR is expressed by most leukocytes including<br>
monocytes, macrophages, -neutrophils -and -platelets	uPAR<br>
is an activation antigen in monocytes and T cells {Min, 1992][Nykjaer, 1994] and T-cells from HIV-1 infected individuals express elevated levels of uPAR [Nykjaer, 1994]. HIV-1 infection of leukocytes in vitro causes up-regulation of uPAR cell surface expression in a process which appear to be coordinated temporally with the onset of viral replication [Frank, 1996], [Speth, 1998].<br>
uPAR may be shed from the cell surface generating a soluble form of the receptor (suPAR) lacking the GPI-anchor. The shedding mechanism is poorly understood but may occur by GPI-specific phospholipase D catalyzed hydrolytic cleavage of the GPI-anchor (Wilhelm, 1999) . Soluble forms of uPAR (suPAR) has been identified in cell culture supernatants and in diverse biological fluids such as tumor ascites, cystic fluid, serum, plasma and<br>
recently also in urine [Pedersen, 1993], [Ronne, 1995], [Stephens, 1997], [Sier, 1998], [Chavakis, 1998], [Stephens, 1999], [Wahlberg, 1998], [Sier, 1999].<br>
Serum, plasma and urine levels of suPAR are elevated in patients  suffering  from  different  types  of  cancer [Stephens, 1997], [Sier, 1998], [Stephens, 1999],  [Sier, 1998], the paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria syndrome (PNH) syndrome [R0nne, 1995],  [Ninomiya, 1997], and in-rheumatoid arthritis patients [Slot, 1999]. The plasma level of suPAR is furthermore a prognostic marker for overall survival in patients suffering from ovarian and colorectal cancer [Sier, 1998], [Stephens, 1999] and for the response to therapy in leukemia [Must.joki, 1999] .<br>
The cellular origin of circulating suPAR is not known. Many, if not all, cells which express uPAR also shed soluble forms of the receptor when cultured in vitro. The source of excess serum suPAR in cancer patients has been suggested -to - derive -from— the -cancer"cells ancl/or tumor-infiltrating macrophages as these cells often express high levels of uPAR [Stephens, 1997] and experiments using xenografted mice carrying human tumors have indeed demonstrated that the tumor tissue does release suPAR to the circulation and urine [Holst-Hansen, 1999].<br>
Persons infected with HIV-1 probably represents the single most well medically monitored group of patients ever in history. Despite these very intensive studies only few prognostic markers, providing long-term predictions of clinical outcome, have proven strong enough to obtain broad clinical acceptance. Currently used prognostic markers for disease progression in untreated HIV-1 infected patients are essentially restricted to the blood concentration of CD4 positive<br>
lymphocytes (the CD4 cell count) , the plasma level of HIV-1 RNA (the viral load), and the age of the patient.<br>
CD4+ T cell counting' is a general marker of immune deficiency,  whereas  HIV  viral  load  provides  direct information about viral replication. Although these two parameters are based on different approaches, they both provide information about the expected clinical outcome and prognosis of the patient. In specific cases one of the two as.says is more useful than the other, which is the reason that both markers are found to be independent parameters in multivariate analysis. Hence, preferably both markers should be used together. Other potential prognostic parameters like age of the patients or B2 microglobulin  level  give  additional  information,  but usually their significance decrease if they are used in multivariate analyses together with CD4+ or HIV viral load.<br>
After the introduction	of -highly -active- anti-retroviral<br>
therapy (HAART) therapy, viral load is dramatically reduced and CD4 T cell counts become stable, which decreases the clinical use of these markers for prognostic/diagnostic purposes. Hence, there is a strong need for novel.markers useful for monitoring patients in HAART therapy.<br>
Measurements of CD4•cell counts -and HIV-1 viral load are expensive and require equipment (flow-cytometers and PCR-machines) which is unlikely to be affordable for wide use in developing countries such as Uganda, Rwanda and Namibia. In these countries, around 30% of individuals between the age of 20 and 49 years are infected (October 1999 data).<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
The technical problem addressed by the present invention is to provide a novel marker for diagnosing and prognosticating HIV infection. A further technical problem addressed by the present invention is to provide a marker of the said type, which is simple and affordable to measure.<br>
The present invention has provided a solution to the above technical problems, the invention being directed to a method of diagnosing or prognosticating HIV infection in a subject comprising the steps of<br>
(a) performing in vitro a measurement of the level of a marker in the form of (i) urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR), (ii) soluble urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (suPAR), (iii) urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA), (iv) one or more degradation products of (i) , (ii) or (iii), and/or (v) an mRNA for (i) , - (ii-)—or—(ii-i) , in a biological fluid sample from" a ~ subject, and<br>
(b) using the measurement value obtained to evaluate the state of the subject.<br>
The invention is-based on the discovery that soluble uPAR (suPAR) is present in elevated • levels in serum, plasma and,urine of HIV infected individuals, and that the level of suPAR is useful as a diagnostic marker. Also, the level of suPAR in HIV infected individuals is prognostic for the development of AIDS, the CD4 T cell decline, and death. The suPAR level is a novel and highly diagnostic and prognostic factor, even in the context of other known prognostic factors related to HIV disease. In fact/ in various multivariate analyses including all presently ' known relevant survival-related parameters, suPAR was the second strongest parameter after CD4 T-cell count. 'In a<br>
comparative analysis against CD4, suPAR kept its highly significant  prognostic  value  (Hazard Rate  (HR)  2.5, P
Moreover, the present invention is based on the discovery that, at least for some HIV patients, not only was the<br>
*<br>
total suPAR level enhanced, but there was also a change in the ratio between various degradation product variants of suPAR. The pattern of these variants was clearly different in some subgroups of patients compared to healthy blood donors. Therefore, the measurement of one or more degradation product variants of suPAR may also be used as a marker for diagnosing arid prognosticating HIV infection.<br>
Furthermore, the present invention is based on the recognition that the amount of suPAR is correlated to the amount of uPAR as well as to the amount of uPA, and that therefore ~ the amounts" of UPAR~ and" uPA are equally suitable as diagnostic and prognostic -indicators of HIV infection.<br>
Finally, when uPAR, suPAR and uPA are present at high levels, i.e. expressed at- high levels, this means that mRNA for the said proteins are present at high levels, and  therefore  said  mRNA  are  equally  suitable  as diagnostic and prognostic indicators of HIV infection.<br>
A further advantage of the invention is that measurement of suPAR can be performed using e.g. a simple ELISA technique or even a stick and may therefore provide a-very inexpensive, simple and' quick supplement to the currently used prognostic tools for HIV-1 infected persons. Thus, in developing countries without the financial possibility to carry out the costly assays used<br>
in the western world/ suPAR levels could be -used 1) 'to determine HIV status (diagnosis) , 2) to select patients for treatment (prognosis), and 3) to monitor the progress of treatment.<br>
Furthermore, the present invention involves the advantage that while suPAR levels also can be measured in a urine sample, a blood sample is necessary for measurement of CD4 counts and HIV viral load, and of course a urine sample is much more easy to obtain.<br>
The invention further relates to a method of evaluating the progression of the state of a subject suffering from HIV infection comprising the steps of<br>
(a) performing in vitro a measurement of the level of a marker in the form of (i) urokinase plasminogen activator receptor  (uPAR),  (ii)  soluble  urokinase  plasminogen activator   receptor   (suPAR),   (iii)   urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA)y (iv)-one or  more degradatidn products of (i),  (ii) or (iii), and/or (v) an mRNA for (i),  (ii) or (iii), in each of a number of biological fluid samples from a subject, wherein the samples are obtained at different points in time, and (b) using the measurement values obtained to evaluate the progression of the state of the subject.<br>
This method may be used to continuously monitor the state of the patient.<br>
Finally, the present invention relates to an ELISA-kit according to claim 8, and a stick-kit according to claim 9.<br>

Detailed description of the invention.<br>
In  the  following,  -the invention  is  explained"  in<br>
particular with reference to suPAR for reasons of simplicity. This should not be understood as a limitation of the scope of the present invention to suPAR. Furthermore, suitable extrapolations to uPAR, uPA and the degradation products of all the said three substances lie' well within the skill of a person skilled in the art.<br>
The inventors have surprisingly found that the concentration of suPAR, a molecule that is in general known to be involved in cell migration and adhesion, is increased in serum and urine from HIV-infected persons compared with healthy controls. Enhanced serum suPAR levels detected 91.6% of the HIV-patients (n=191) with a specificity of 93.3%, cf. Example 1. Moreover, subgroups of patients with low, intermediate and high levels of suPAR, respectively, showed significant differences in<br>
survivaL., cf. "Example 2. Patients in the intermediate<br>
suPAR group had an enhanced hazard ratio (HR) of 2.17, whereas high suPAR serum levels were even more hazardous (HR 3.29, see Table 1 below). The prognostic value of suPAR stayed significant even when it was tested in a multivariate  analysis  against  the  strongest  known parameters presently available. In fact, suPAR was found to be the second strongest prognostic factor, directly after CD4+ C-cell counts, and even in a direct comparison with CD4 (or any of the other parameters) suPAR kept its independent prognostic value  (P
 The biological fluid sample may be any -fluid that can be obtained from humans i.e. sputum, cystic fluid, ascites, blood, serum, plasma, and urine. Urine is preferred due to the fact that it is easy to obtain. When urine is used as the biological fluid sample, the measurement of the marker should be correlated to the total concentration level of the sample, e.g. by correlating the measurement of the marker to the content of creatinine in the sample.<br>
Preferably, the biological fluid sample is stored at a temperature of below 0 °C, more preferably from -20 °C to -80 °C, until measurement.<br>
The measurement of the marker in the biological fluid sample may be carried out using any available method/device therefore. Examples of such measurement methods/devices are ELISA, RIA (radioimmunoassay),<br>
estern blotting,  FACS  analysis,  sticks,  etc.  Also,<br>
t<br>
measurement may be  carried out by determining mRNA expression  using  RT-PCR,  northern  blotting,  RNase protection assay or using micro-array techniques etc. Preferred  measurement  methods/devices  are  ELISA  and sticks.<br>
An ELISA may be carried out in a number of different embodiments, many of which are applicable in the present invention. One ELISA . embodiment, which is particularly suitable for use in the present invention, is the one described by [Holst-Hansen, 1999] and [Stephens, 1999], which are included herein by this reference.<br>
The measurement of the marker may be carried out using any suitable stick. Preferably, the stick -is a stick comprising an antibody to the marker as a capture agent.<br>
Preferably,, the measurement of uPAR or uPA in the biological fluid sample is carried out by FACS " analysis, western blotting or ELISA. mRNA levels may be determined using RT-PCR, Northern blotting, Micro arrays or protection assays.<br>
Preferably, the measurement of uPAR/suPAR/uPA degradation products is carried out using western blotting.<br>
The measurement of uPAR is carried out in biological fluid samples containing uPAR expressing' cells, i.e. blood samples.<br>
The measurement value of the level of marker obtained in step (a) may be used to evaluate the state of the subject by comparing the measurement value with the level of the marker in subjects not infected with HIV virus.<br>
As mentioned above, one aspect of the present invention relates to a method of evaluating the progression of' the state of a subject suffering from HIV infection. In particular, this method is suitable for monitoring subjects undergoing treatment, e.g. highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART).<br>
The measurement values of the level of marker obtained in step (a) may be used to, evaluate the progression of the state of the subject by comparing the measurement values with the level of the marker in subjects not infected with HIV and/or by comparing the temporal course of measurement values with that of subjects not infected withHIV.<br>
The invention further relates to an ELISA-kit for evaluating the physical state of a subject suffering from HIV infection comprising a) -an immobilised capture agent-capable of capturing a marker in the form of (i)<br>
soluble urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (suPAR), (iii) urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA), (iv) one or more degradation products of (i), (ii) or (iii), and/or (v) an mRNA for (i), (ii) or (iii), and b) a binding partner capable of binding to the marker, the binding partner comprising c) a label system.<br>
The capture agent may be an antibody to the marker. The binding partner may be an antibody to the marker.<br>
Preferably, the label system is conjugated to the binding partner. The label system may be any conventionally used label system, such as antibody to the binding agent conjugated to an enzyme, e.g. an immunoglobulin-alkaline phosphatase conjugate.<br>
Furthermore,  the  invention  relates  to  a  stick  for evaluating the physical state of a subject suffering from HIV infection comprising a) an immobilised capture agent capable  of  capturing a marker  in  the  form of  (i) urokinase plasminogen activator receptor  (uPAR),  (ii) soluble urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (suPAR), (iii) urokinase-type plasmino'gen activator  (uPA) ,  (iv) one or more degradation products of (i), (ii) or (iii), and/or  (v)  an mRNA for (i) ,  (ii) or (iii) ', and b) a binding partner capable of binding to the said, marker, the binding partner comprising c) a label'"system.<br>

EXAMPLES<br>
Example 1; Diagnosis of HIV infection by measurement of serum suPAR.<br>
Aim:<br>
To determine whether HIV patients has elevated levels of suPAR in serum, i.e. whether suPAR levels may be used to diagnose HIV infection.<br>
Description of the experiment:<br>
Using ELISA, the concentration and fragmentation of suPAR in serum samples from healthy- donors and from HIV-infected patients were measured.<br>
suPAR  was  measured  retrospectively  on  thawed  serum<br>
i<br>
samples by ELISA as described by [Holst-Hansen, 1999] and [Stephens,  1999]. The following minor modifications of the technique were used: BSA was used as a blocking reagent in stead of SuperBlock (Pierce Biochemicals), and endpoint measurements were used in stead of kinetics. These  modifications  were  not  found  to  affect  the sensitivity and/or specificity of the assay notably.<br>
Results:<br>
The results obtained are shown in Figure 1, which is a Box-whisker plot showing elevated concentrations of suPAR in serum from 191 HIV-positive individuals compared to healthy  blood  donors.   The  difference  is  highly significant  according  to  the  Mann-Whitney  U-test (P
High serum concentrations of suPAR (cut-off value: 2.61 ng/ml = mean level in blood donors + 2x S.D.) were strongly indicative of HIV infection with 91.6% sensitivity and 93.3% specificity. Survival analyses showed that next to the diagnostic value enhanced suPAR serum levels were also highly indicative for survival of the patients.<br>
Discussion:<br>
The experiment suggests that patients could be diagnosed/screened for HIV-infection in a cheap and convenient way by using ELISA on serum. This could be of<br>
se particularly in low developed countries, where costs, easy handling and low hazardness are more relevant.<br>
Example 2: Prognosis of HIV infection by measurement of serum suPAR<br>
Description of the experiment:<br>
The results obtained in Example 1 were used to perform a Kaplan-Meier survival analysis of 191 HIV-positive patients. The patients were divided in 3 equal groups (tertiles&gt; n=63, n=64 and n=64 respectively) based on suPAR concentrations in serum. The overall difference between the groups was highly significant according to the log-rank test (P
Results:<br>
The results are presented in Figure 2 and in Table 1 below<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Table 1 gives the results of Cox proportional hazards survival analyses on 'tertiled1 parameters showing the prognostic value of serum suPAR levels alone and in comparison with other known prognostic factors in a 'group of 191. HIV patients. All parameters were treated as tertiles corresponding to Figure 2. As expected most of the parameters lost some of their significance in the multivariate  analyses  compared  to  the  univariate counterpart, in particular age and B2-microglobulin, but CD4+  and  especially  suPAR  kept  their  significance completely.  The  multivariate  analyses  included  138 patients.<br>
HR:  hazard  ratio;  CI:  confidence  interval;  ns:  not significant.<br>
Discussion:<br>
The height of the suPAR level has strong-prognostic value independent from the mosst relevant othermarkers CD4L+ T-cell count and HIV-load. suPAR levels are not correlated with HIV-load and only weakly with CD4+ (R=0.303) and is an  independent  parameter  in  multivariate  survival analysis,  indicating  that  suPAR  gives  additional information for prognosis. This implicates that suPAR could especially be useful in circumstances that these other markers are not usable, for instance for monitoring .patients during HAART-therapy.<br>
Example 3: Prognosis of HIV infection in HAART patients by measurement of urinary suPAR.<br>
Aim:<br>
To determine whether HAART patients have elevated suPAR levels compared with HIV negative controls. If so, suPAR<br>
may hold prognostic value in HAART patients in whom viral load is  no longer measurable  (and therefore has no prognostic value) and CD4 T cell counts remain steady (and therefore has no prognostic value).<br>
Description of the experiment:<br>
Twenty HIV patients without AIDS undergoing HAART therapy kindly donated urine. Furthermore, 10 HIV negative hospital workers donated urine. Creatinine and suPAR was measured in the urine samples and is expressed as suPAR/creatinine, The HAART patients had a significant higher level of suPAR/creatinine compared to healthy controls (Figure 3).<br>
Results<br>
The results obtained are shov/n in Figure 3, which shows elevated concentrations of suPAR in urine obtained from<br>
patients. in HAART  therapy -compared—with -urinary ; suPAR- -<br>
levels from HIV-negative volunteers. suPAR was normalized for urine dilution by the creatinine concentration. The difference between both groups was highly significant according to Mann Whitney U-test (P
Discussion:<br>
Patients receiving HAART therapy have elevated levels of suPAR.  This may be used to monitor the  success of therapy, such as to predict- viral rebounce in patients-undergoing HAART therapy.<br>
Example 4: The suPAR level is predictive for the decrease in CD4 T cell counts in HIV infected individuals<br>
Introduction<br>
In Example. 2 and 3 it was shown that suPAR is a strong prognostic factor. In the Copenhagen HIV Immune Cohort (CHIC), cf. ref. 18-25, it was further shown that various factors are prognostic to the progression to death.<br>
In this Example  it  is  investigated whether various prognostic factors can predict CD4 T. cell decline.<br>

Random coefficient regression models were used' to analyse the relationship between individual CD4 counts during 1-year follow-up after the first measurement on one . side and possible explanatory variables on the other side. CD4 counts were used as dependent variables on a natural log scale assuming an individual linear development during the one-year of follow-up. LogCD4 = time (in years) + time*log HIV RNA + time*age (in years) was used as an initial  basic  model   calculating  the   individual development in CD4 count as a function of individual viral load and individual age. This model calculates a basic slope and estimates the effect on the CD4 count slope  added by viral  load and age.  The  following additional independent variables were added to the model one by one, to calculate if any of these variables had any significant effect on the CD4 count slope once viral load  and  age  were  known:  Beta2-microglobulin,  IgA (immunoglobulin A), IFN-gamma (interferon-gamma), MIP-1 (macrophage inflammatory protein), suPAR, LAK (leucocyte activated killer) cell activity, TTV (TT virus) titer. Any  effect  on .the  slope  of  the  CD4  curve  by antiretroviral treatment at enrolment or by initiation of antiretroviral treatment during the one-year follow-up was also evaluated.<br>
Results<br>
The results obtained in CHIC were used as a basis for the calculations in the present Example. The results appear e.g. from references 18-25.<br>
When added to the original model with age and viral load, suPAR was the only variable that showed any significant correlation with the CD4 .T cell decline. In this model 1 ng/ml higher suPAR corresponds to 0.11 decrease in log (CD4) . In comparison, 1 loglO higher -plasma HIV RNA corresponds to 0.48 decrease in logCD4 whereas 1 year, older age corresponds to 0.02 decrease in logCD4 during one year of follow-up.<br>
On a linear scale these figures translates to a 10.4%, 38.2% and 2.0% annual decrease'in CD4 count per: 1 ng/ml higher suPAR, 1 loglO higher plasma HIV RNA, and 1 year older, .age, respectively. These-numbers translate in to" "a"" 79.5% higher loss of CD4 cells in average for the patient with the highest suPAR level (15.5 ng/ml) compared to the patient with the lowest level.<br>
Discussion<br>
The CHIC cohort is one of the most studied cohorts in the world with respect to prognostic factors (ref. 18-25). The CD4 T cell counts, HIV viral load, Beta-2-microglobulin, IgA, IFN-gamma, MIP-1-beta , suPAR, LAK cell activity, age and TT viral load have been shown to carry prognostic value for progression to death. In this study, we investigated whether any of these prognostic factors could predict the CD4 T cell decline. The random coefficient regression model showed that only the age of the patient, the HIV viral load and the serum level of<br>
uPAR are significantly associated with the CD4 T cell decline.<br>
Example 5: SuPAR can predict outcome of therapy in HIV infected individuals<br>
Introduction.<br>
Approximately half of the patients who start in Highly Active Anti-Retroviral Therapy (HAART) experience viral rebound after six months of treatment. In this Example it is investigated whether serum suPAR is -"reduced during HAART and whether the pre-HAART suPAR value is predictive for the potential efficacy of treatment.<br>
Materials and methods:<br>
Thirty-three HIV positive patients from Department of Infectious Diseases, Hvidovre University Hospital/ were included in the sixteen patients had undetectabled <br>
viral RNA six months after HAART initiation and seventeen patients had detectable viral RNA after 6 months of HAART (&gt;200 copies/ml). Twenty-eight patients had been subjected to antiretroviral treatment, prior to the start of HAART and five patients had not been exposed to treatment previously.<br>
Five samples were obtained from each patient, two samples preceeding HAART and three samples after initiation of HAART. The samples were named SI to S5. SI was obtained' median 3.9 months preceding HAART (range: 1.1 - 106.6 months), S2 was obtained median 0.6 months preceeding HAART (range: 0.3 - 5.7 months), S3 was obtained median 1.9 months after initiation of HAART (range: 0.7 - 8.6 months), S4 was obtained median 6.4 months after initiation of HAART (range: 1.8 - 16.1 months), S5 was<br><br>
obtained median 21.4 months after initiation of HAART<br>
(range: 5.7 - 39.6 months). CD4 counts were obtained by routine FACS analysis. HIV viral load was determined using Roche Amplicor HIV RNA kit according to the manufactures instructions. SuPAR was measured using ELISA with R2 as catching antibody and polyclonal rabbit Alfa-uPAR as detecting antibody. The ELISA was carried out as in reference 26.<br>
Results:<br>
After HAART (S5), the suPAR level had dropped compared to the last sample before HAART initiation (S2) with an average of 15%.<br>
Those who failed therapy (experienced viral rebound after 6 months, of treatment) had higher suPAR levels both before and after HAART. ' The suPAR value in the last sample before HAART initiation (S2) contained higher<br>
levels -of- suPAR ---:in- -those -pat-lent s—that-had	viral —rebound-<br>
after HAART. Figure 4 shows the suPAR levels divided into two. groups by response to HAART for S1-S6 in a Mann-Whitney U-test; p = 0.05.<br>
Discussion:<br>
This  study comprised 33 patients,  who were followed before and after initiation of therapy. The patients were selected on whether they had a good or bad response to treatment,  as determined by whether they experienced viral rebound after six months of treatment. Even though the number of patients in this study was small, it was found that those patients who experienced viral rebound had significantly higher levels of suPAR in the serum samples taken before treatment compared to those patients whose HIV viral load remained, fully suppressed after six<br>
months of HAART. Even though these data have to be confirmed in larger studies, these data strongly indicate that suPAR carry important information on the outcome of HAART.<br>
Example 6: The suPAR level in serum increases during HIV infection and is prognostic for survival<br>
Fifteen haemophilic HIV positive patients were followed up to 17 years after the first HIV positive test. The serum suPAR level and the CD4 T 'cell count were measured. During the follow-up, 8 patients died. The serum suPAR level 'significantly increased during infection, and both the increase as well as the suPAR level was significantly associated  with  survival.  When  performing  a  Cox univariate analysis, both the first CD4 T cell count and the first suPAR level were significantly associated with survival.  Both remained significantly associated with survival when included in a multivariate Cox regression model.—Furthermore, --the-- suPAR level- - -was -.predictive, :for the CD4 T cell decrease over time.<br>
Example 7; The serum level of soluble uPAR is prognostic for development of AIDS and death in HIV infection.<br>
Introduction<br>
In Examples 2-6 it was shown that the soluble .form of the urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (suPAR) is a strong and independent prognostic factor for HIV disease progression. In this example, the strong prognostic value of suPAR is confirmed in another Danish cohort. Furthermore, the possible prognostic value of PAI-1 4G/5G promoter polymorphism is investigated.<br>
Recently, the prognostic value of suPAR in the Copenhagen<br>
HIV Immune Cohort (CHIC)  (26) was investigated. It was<br>
found that the serum level -of suPAR was a strong prognostic marker in this Danish cohort. Furthermore, the prognostic strength was independent of the CD4 T cell count and the HIV RNA.<br>
The reason for the strong prognostic value of suPAR is not known. It has previously been demonstrated that uPA binds to the conserved apex sequence -GPGR(A/V}- of the V3-loop in gp!20 (27), a sequence very important for viral function and implicated in the binding to chemokine receptors. Thus, it is likely that uPA may form a bridge between uPAR located on the cell surface and HIV. If this is the case, uPA carries prognostic value. Also, PAI-1 which may bind and internalise uPA/uPAR complexes (28) and the amount of PAI may therefore have an effect of the number of available uPA/uPAR complexes. The '4G/5G genetic polymorphism in the PAI-1 promoter has been shown to influence the plasma PAI-1 level  (29) . Thus,  in this example,different components  of the  plasminogerf activator system and their possible prognostic value in a Danish cohort of HIV infected homosexual men have been investigated.<br>
Subjects and samples<br>
All subjects are part of the .Copenhagen AIDS cohort (CAC). The cohort is a seroprevalent cohort established between 1984 and 1988, with the majority (81%) of the 153 subjects  enrolled  in  1985  (30).  All  subjects  were homosexual Danish men. At enrollment a thorough physical examination was performed, and blood was drawn. The CD4 counts used in this study correspond to the time of serum sample.   Informed  consent  was  obtained  from . all participants.  The cohort was approved by The Medical .Ethics Committee of Copenhagen County. AIDS was diagnosed<br><br>
in accordance with the 1987 Centers for Disease Control<br>
and Prevention criteria (AIDS-87). Eight patients had<br>
developed AIDS at the time of serum sampling. Of the 133<br>
patients 'from whom serum was available, 89 patients died<br>
during the follow-up. Of these, eight died for unknown<br>
reasons without having been diagnosed with AIDS. DMA was<br>
available from 113 of the patients for the PAI-1 promoter<br>
analysis.	• •<br>
SuPAR measurement<br>
SuPAR was measured as previously described- (9) . Statistics<br>
Survival analysis and analysis of time to development of AIDS were made using Cox regression analysis and Kaplan Meyer analysis. Comparisons between groups were made with students T test.<br>
Results<br>
suPAR was measured retrospectively on serum from 133 patients using ELISA. All patients had measurable suPAR. .The mean suPAR level was 1,87 ng/ml. When dividing the patients by median suPAR level (67/66), those with high suPAR progressed significantly faster towards AIDS as shown in the Kaplan Meyer  (Fig.  5) .  Mean time  for progression to AIDS in the low suPAR group was 8.0 years, while those with high suPAR progressed to AIDS in' 4.2 years. Similar, in progression to death those with low suPAR died median 8.5 years after the suPAR measurement, and those with high suPAR level died median 6.6 years (Fig.  6)(P

death, and that the; prognostic value of suPAR .is independent of 'the CD4 T cell count. This is also demonstrated in Figure 1, which shows no significant difference in CD4 T cell counts between those with low and those with .high suPAR (P=0.9, t-testj .<br>
We  observed  no  influence  of  PAI-1  4G/5G  promoter polymorphisms on progression to AIDS or death (P=0.6).<br>
Discussion<br>
In this study, it was found that the -serum level of soluble urokinase receptor is a strong prognostic factor in HIV infection. The reason for this is unknown, but may imply a specific role of the urokinase system in HIV infection/replication.  It  is possible  that  suPAR/uPA complexes may play an active role in HIV infection. The PAI-1 4G polymorphism has been reported to lead to increased levels of PAI-1 protein, compared to the PAI-1 5G  genotype.  In  this - study,  no  influence  of  PAI-1 ~ promoter polymorphism on HIV disease progression was found.<br>
In conclusion/ previous findings showing that suPAR is a strong prognostic factor in HIV infection has been confirmed. Furthermore, the prognostic value of.suPAR is independent of the CD4 T cell count.<br>

Example 8: Strong prognostic value of suPAR in both HIV-1 and HIV-2 infected individuals from Guinea Bissau<br>
'	*—<br>
Introduction<br>
Over the past decade, the HIV pandemic continues to evolve in most third world countries in both magnitude and diversity. Despite the reduction in numbers of new AIDS cases in the US and Western Europe due to advances in treatment, a constant number of new HIV infections persists every year; -Howeve-r, the -vast majority of new infections still occur in developing countries, and Africa remains in focus of attention with the rapidly increasing epidemics in many countries in the south and east of the continent impacting on all levels of society.<br>
There is no doubt that spread of public knowledge is an important factor in controlling the spread of the disease but development of inexpensive diagnostic/prognostic tools and anti-viral treatment are fundamental in the attempt to reduce severity and case-fatality rates in the developing countries.<br>
In previous examples it has been reported that the soluble form of the. - urokinase receptor (suPAR) is a strong and independent prognostic factor in a cohort of Danish HIV-1 infected individuals. The serum level of<br><br>
suPAR is also a prognostic marker for overall survival in patients suffering from ovarian and colorectal cancer and for the response to therapy in leukaemia (10, 14). The urokinase receptor  (uPAR) is an activation antigen in monocytes and T cells and T-cells from HIV-1 infected individuals express elevated levels of uPAR (3) . HIV-1 infection of leukocytes in vitro causes up-regulation of uPAR cell surface expression in a process that appear to be  coordinated  temporally with  the  onset  of viral replication   (5) .   The  receptor  for  urokinase-type plasminogen activator  (uPAR/CD87)  is anchored to the plasma membrane by a glycosyl phosphatidylinositol (GPI)-linkage.  uPAR  may  be  shed  from  the  cell  surface generating a soluble form of the receptor (suPAR) lacking the GPI-anchor. Soluble forms of uPAR (suPAR) has been identified in cell culture supernatants and in biological fluids such as cystic fluid, serum, plasma and urine (31).<br>
suPAR is;_ .measured	_by a simple ELISA techniqueand may<br>
therefore be of aid in settings, such as Africa, were expensive equipment for measurement of CD4+ T cells and HIV viral load may not be available. Thus, in " this example it is investigated whether HIV-1 and/or HIV-2 infected Africans from Guinea Bissau have elevated suPAR levels and whether the suPAR level carries prognostic value.<br>
Subjects and methods<br>
Sera from 262 patients were available from the tuberculosis (TB) study. After informed consent to participate.in the study, blood was drawn and sera tested for HIV antibodies. Five individuals (1 HIV-1 positive, 4 negatives) were tested at a clinical follow up examination only and not at the initial recruitment. HIV<br>
testing was performed at the National Public Health Laboratory. Sera'were screened using Enzygnost® Anti-HIV • l-t-2 Plus (Behring Diagnostics Gmbh, Marburg, Germany) and confirmed   with   Capillus®   HIV-l/HIV-2   (Cambridge Diagnostics, Galway, Ireland) or Multispot® HIV-l/HIV-2 (Sanofi Diagnostics Pasteur, ' Marnes-la Coquette, France).-Dual  reactive  samples  were  sent  frozen  to  Swedish Institute for Infectious Diseases (SMI) in Stockholm and confirmed using Immunocomb® II Hiv-l&amp;2 Bispot (Orgenics, Yavne, Israel). The study protocol was approved by the Central Ethical Committee of Denmark and by the Ministry of Health of Guinea-Bissau. Transmission-- route for HIV infection is not known, although the majority are sexual transmissions.  Homosexuality is not common in Guinea Bissau.<br>
The CD4- and CDS-cells was counted using the Immuno-Alkaline phosphatase method (IA) (32).<br>
suPAR was measured retrospectively on thawed serum samples by a sensitive ELISA system (9) . The following minor modifications of the technique were used: Bovine serum albumin (2% in phosphate buffered saline) was used as a blocking reagent instead of SuperBlock™, • and reactions were stopped with 100 ul 1 M NaOH after 30 minutes instead of kinetic substrate development. These modifications did not affect the sensitivity or specificity of the assay.<br>
Statistics<br>
All  statistical  analyses  were  performed  using  the statistical program SSPS,  Version 10.  Comparisons of proportions were performed 'using the Chi-square test.. Comparison of unpaired observations was carried out using Kruskal-Wallis test. Kaplan-Meier curves were constructed<br>
by stratifying the patients by the median suPAR level in all HIV positive'p.atients. The-difference between Kaplan-Meier curves was analysed by the log-rank test and the differences between groups by Cox regression. The ability of serum suPAR to predict mortality in the context of other known prognostic markers was formally assessed using the Cox proportional hazards model. Variables were fitted  in  a  continuous  scale  using  the  strongest transformation (as determined by the Wald %2 value) of the individual variables (log-scale CD4 count and linear scale  for  suPAR  and  TB  diagnosis  as  yes/no) .  A significance level of 5 % was used.<br>
Results<br>
Sera from 262 patients were analysed. All. patients had measurable suPAR (range 0.9 - 18.7, mean 3.3 ng/ml). Of the 262 patients, 113 were HIV positive (28 with HIV-1, 66 with HIV-2 and 19 were dual-infected) and 149 were HIV negative. Regarding^pulmonary, disease, - 198 patients were found to be TB positive (sputum confirmed or clinically suspected) and 64 patients were regarded as having non-TB disease (pneumonia or bronchitis).<br>
SuPAR is prognostic for survival in HIV positive African individuals<br>
There was a trend for higher suPAR levels among HIV positive compared to HIV negative (P=0.061, Kruskal Wallis test). There was no difference' in suPAR level between those HIV-1, HIV-2 or dual infected (Fig. 8).. Individuals HIV+/TB+ (N=87) had higher suPAR levels than those HIV+/TB negative (N=26) (P=0.049)(Table 3).<br>
Kaplan Meyer: The HIV positive individuals were split into two groups based on the median suPAR level. In the<br><br>
low suPAR group (N=57) 'median time of survival was 933 days (95% CI: 684-1182 days). In the high suPAR group (N=56), median - survival was 495 days (95% CI: 202-788 days) . The difference in survival between the two groups was significant (Fig. 8, p=0,012, log rank)(Fig. 9). When dividing the HIV positive patients., according to whether they were infected with HIV-1  (the HIV-1 group also included  the  dual  infected)  or  HIV-2,  suPAR  was prognostic for the outcome for both the HIV-1 infected (Fig, 10) and HIV-2 infected (Fig 11).<br>
Cox regression: The following parameters were found to be significantly associated with survival in a univariate Cox regression analysis: LoglO transformed CD4 counts (p=0.030,  N=90),  TB  diagnosis  (0.004,  wald  8.1, RH=1/0.388 N=113) and suPAR (p
SuPAR is elevated in TB positive patients, but carry no prognostic value.<br>
Among the 149 HIV negative individuals, 111 were found to be TB positive. Those who were TB positive had significantly higher suPAR levels compared to the 38 individuals who were clinically diagnosed as TB negative (p=0.001, Kruskal Wallis test), Fig. 12. During follow up, twenty of the TB positive died. suPAR level was not . significantly associated with survival for TB+ individuals (n=lll, p=0.23, Table 3).<br>

(Table Removed)<br>
Discussion<br>
The serum suPAR level in 262 individuals enrolled in a cohort on suspicion of TB has been measured. Among these, 113 individuals were found to be HIV positive. SuPAR was strongly  correlated  with  survival  among  these  HIV positive individuals. We observed no difference in suPAR levels between HIV-1, HIV-2 or dual infected individuals indicating that suPAR carry general prognostic value in HIV infection. Other prognostic factors were CD4 T cell count (log transformed) and TB status. In a multivariate Cox analysis, only suPAR and TB status 'was associated with survival. In our previous study, the CD4 count was significantly associated with survival in a multivariate model (26). This difference may be due to different CD4 T cell counting methods in the two studies i.e. FACS versus the Immuno-Alkaline phosphatase method (33).<br>
Among the 149 HIV negative individuals studied, 111 were<br>
found to be TB -pos-i-t-i-ve-.--S-ig-n-ifleant--higher suPAR _le_vels	<br>
among the TB positive/HIV negative patients compared to the TB negative/HIV negative patients were • observed. However, no prognostic value of suPAR among the TB positive/HIV negative, where- twenty died during follow-up, was found.<br>
The strong prognostic role of suPAR in HIV infected individuals may imply a direct role of the plasminogen activator system in HIV infection. In contrast, no prognostic role of suPAR was found among the TB positive/HIV negative compared to the TB negative/HIV negative, and the elevated suPAR level among the TB positive may reflect a general immune.activation.<br>
It is necessary to find cheap and efficient ways to monitor and treat HIV disease in Africa. Measurement of<br><br>
suPAR  is  technically  simple  (ELISA  followed by  OD<br>
measurement at 405 nm).<br>
Example 9: The serum level of soluble urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor is a strong and independent predictor of survival in HIV infection<br>
Abstract<br>
HIV-1 infection has been shown to result in up-regulation<br>
*<br>
of the urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR/CD87)  on leukocytes in vitro and in vivo.  The objective of this study was to investigate whether this upregulation is paralleled by&gt; higher serum levels of soluble uPAR  (suPAR)  in patients with advanced HIV-1 disease,  and  whether  the  serum  level  of  suPAR  is predictive of clinical outcome. Using an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay  (ELISA)  we measured the level of suPAR retrospectively in serum samples from 314 HIV-1 positive -individuals. By Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses  the serum suPAR levels were  correlated to survival with AIDS related death as endpoint. High levels of serum suPAR (&gt; median) were associated with poor overall survival and Kaplan-Meier analysis on patients stratified by suPAR level demonstrates  a continuous increase in mortality with higher suPAR levels. After adjustment for accepted prognostic markers including the Centers  for  Disease  Control  (CDC)  defined  clinical stages,  CD4 counts,  viral load,  {32-microglobulin,  and age, the prognostic strength of suPAR remained highly significant indicating that the serum suPAR level is a novel, strong and independent predictor of survival in HIV-1 infection. This report is the first to demonstrate an  important  association  between  the  plasminogen activator  system  and  disease  progression  in  HIV-1 infection.<br><br>
Introduction<br>
The urokinase-type plasminogen activator system consists of a proteinase (uPA), a receptor (uPAR) and inhibitors. The system is involved in pericellular proteolysis, cell migration, and tissue remodeling by multiple modes of action  i.e.  proteolysis/  signal  transduction,  and chemokine-like activities  (1,34).  Under physiological conditions uPA and uPAR is predominantly expressed by blood cells including neutrophils, monocytes, macrophages and activated T-cells (35) for which they*~are believed to play  important  roles  in  cell  activation,  adhesion, migration and extravasation (36,37,38).<br>
High serum levels of suPAR, the soluble form of uPAR, have recently been associated with worse overall survival of cancer patients (10,12) and it has been suggested that in cancer the excess of suPAR in the circulation derives from tumor -cel-l-s or -tumor -infiltrating macrophages ..(10, 12, 7, 17) which often express high levels of uPAR (39).<br>
The fact that enhanced serum suPAR levels are indicative for up-regulated cellular uPAR levels, combined with the previously published data that HIV-1 infection leads to enhanced cell surface expression of uPAR on mononcytes and T-lymphocytes both 'in vitro and in vivo (3, 4, 5) prompted us to investigate the relationship between serum suPAR levels in HIV-1 infected individuals and progression of the disease.<br>
Methods<br>
Patients<br>
The  Copenhagen  HIV  Immune  Cohort   (CHIC)   is  a<br><br>
seroprevalent cohort consisting of 347 HIV-1 infected patients . enrolled from the Department of Infectious Diseases at Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark, between September 19'91 and October 1992 as previously described (25) . The cohort was followed from inclusion until June 1997, however in the current study follow-up was censored when the first patient in the cohort received a protease inhibitor  (1st May 1996). Thirty-three patients  (9.5%) for whom a serum sample was not available were excluded from this study. There were no significant differences in follow-up time,  age,  CD4 count,  viral load,  and 02-microglobulin level between patients in the current study and those excluded. At enrolment into CHIC, blood was drawn  for  determination  of  CD4  count,  and  other serological parameters related to HIV-1 progression. Of the 314 serum samples available for 'suPAR measurement, 208 were obtained at the time of enrolment (baseline) and the remaining 106 close to the time of enrolment (median: 0.9 month' before, range: 8.4 month before to 7.2 month af.ter) . All other serological- values used in this study " were baseline values. Clinical staging of the patients was performed according to the 1993 Centers for Disease Control  (CDC)  AIDS  surveillance  case  definition  for adolescents and adults. Of the 314 patients included in this .study 230 (73.2%) received anti-retroviral treatment with  one  or  more  nucleoside  reverse  transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) before enrolment or during follow-up. Of these patients 140 (60.9%) received one, 88 (38.3%) two and 2 (0.9%) three NRTIs. No patients ever received three  NRTIs   simultaneously.   Follow-up  times  were calculated from the date of enrolment and up to the date of death (caused by AIDS) or censored at the 1st of May 1996.  The  data  were  cross-checked  with  the  Danish National Registry System and patients who were lost during follow-up were censored at the last day they.were known to be alive.<br>
Measurement of serum suPAR, CD4 count, viral load and (32-microglobulin.<br>
suPAR was  measured  retrospectively  on  thawed  serum samples by a sensitive ELISA system (12, 17). Samples were measured in duplicates and inter-plate variation was,  if necessary,  corrected by the inclusion of a reference sample on all plates. With respect to the published method the following minor modifications of the technique  were  used:  Bovine  serum  albumin  (2%  in phosphate buffered saline) was used as a blocking reagent and endpoint measurements were used instead of kinetic substrate development.  CD4 count,  viral load and 02-microglobulin level had previously been determined in the majority of these patients (20, 18).<br>
Statistical analysis<br>
All statistical .analyses were performed using statistical packages (SSPS, Version 8 and SAS® version 6.12) and the observed differences were considered significant if the p-value was below 0.05. Comparisons of proportions were performed using  the  Chi-square  test.  Comparison of unpaired observations for continues variables was carried out  using  Kruskal-Wallis  or  Mann-Whitney  U-tests. Correlation's were calculated using the Spearman rank test. Kaplan-Meier curves were constructed stratifying the patients by the level of serum suPAR to generate similar number of patients in each stratum. Differences between Kaplan-Meier curves were analyzed by the log-rank test and by Cox regression. The ability of serum suPAR to predict  mortality  in  the  context  of  other  known prognostic  markers  was  formally  assessed  using  a multivariate Cox proportional hazards model. Variables were  fitted  in  a   continuous   scale  using  the<br><br>
transformations which provided the best fit as determined by the Wald %2 value (log-scale for viral load, CD4 count and (32-microglobulin, and linear scale for suPAR and age) .<br>
Results<br>
Levels of suPAR in serum<br>
All 314 HIV-1 infected, patients had measurable levels of<br>
«<br>
serum suPAR with a median value of 3.69 ng/ml (range: 1.15 - 15.60 ng/ml). Division of all patients into two equal groups by the median suPAR level revealed several significant differences  (Table 3) . Patients with high suPAR had a shorter follow-up time (p 
the patients received anti-retroviral treatment at the<br>
time of enrolment (p = 0.3).<br>
Division of the patients into three groups by the CDC defined  clinical  stages  A,  B  and .• C  (Figure  10) demonstrated  that  more  advanced  HIV-1  disease  was associated with higher levels of serum suPAR (p 
Figure rQ shows serum suPAR levels in patients with CDC defined HIV-1 disease stages A, B and C.

Within each of the clinical stages A, B and C the proportion of survivors was significantly (p = 0.03, Chi-square test) higher among patients with suPAR levels below the median, indicating a possible correlation' between suPAR levels and survival at different stages of HIV-1 infection.<br>
Spearman rank correlation's demonstrated a weak but significant negative correlation between suPAR and CD4 count (Rho = -0.33, p 
Kaplan-Meier analysis<br>
To investigate the association between suPAR levels and survival a Kaplan-Meier analysis (Figure lA.) has been performed.<br>
Association between the level of suPAR in serum from 314 HIV-1 infected patients- and overall survival. Patients were divided"into three strata based • on the serum suPAR values, yielding similar number (n=104-105) of patients in each stratum. The three curves in the figure thus represent patients with serum suPAR  4.19 ng/ml (High). The overall difference between the groups was highly<br>
significant (p 
In the absence of any relevant cut-off value for serum suPAR use was made of the 33% and 66% percentile of suPAR levels, generating three groups of patients of similar size (n=104-105 patients)  representing low, medium and high serum suPAR levels. The survival curve for patients with low serum suPAR were significantly different from that of medium suPAR (p = 0.0008, x2 = H/ log-rank test) which in turn was significantly different from that of patients with high suPAR (p 
Cox regression analysis<br>
Comparison of the three patient groups in the Kaplan-Meier plot (Figure 11) by Cox regression analysis demonstrated a continuously increasing_risk of mortality with increasing suPAR level. Compared to patients with a low suPAR level, a medium suPAR level was. associated with a hazard ratio (HR) of 2.2 (95% confidence interval (95%CI) : 1.4 - 3.4, p 
When suPAR was fitted as a continues variable in a Cox model including all patients high levels of suPAR were significantly associated with an increased mortality (Table 5) . An increase in serum suPAR of 1 ng/ml was associated with a HR of 1.6 (95%CI: 1.5' - 1.8, p

The predictive strength of suPAR in this subset (n=231) of patients was virtually identical to when the analysis was performed on all 314 patients (not shown). In the multivariate Cox model suPAR, CD4 count, viral load, p2-microglobulin and CDC stage C, provided statistically significant independent prognostic information. According to. the Wald X" value, suPAR was a stronger predictor of survival than the CD4 count and viral load.<br>

Discussion<br>
In the present work evidence has been provided that serum suPAR is a strong independent prognostic variable in HIV-1 infection. In Kaplan-Meier survival analysis higher serum levels of. suPAR are associated with faster progression to death. After adjustment for all known relevant HIV-1 disease progression markers in multivariate Gox -regression analysissuPAR"remains a highly significant independent predictor of survival. This is to our knowledge the first report demonstrating a connection between the urokinase plasminogen activator system and disease progression in HIV-1 infection.<br>
One possible explanation for the prognostic value of serum suPAR in HIV-1 infection is that it derives, at least partially, from HIV-1 infected cells. Monocytes and T-lymphocytes infected with HIV-1 have been shown to express elevated levels of cell-surface uPAR (3, 4, 5) and the serum level of suPAR may correlate with the size of the reservoir of HIV-1 infected cells in the organism. This model predicts that suPAR levels will be higher in HIV-1 infected individuals than in healthy controls, a possibility which we have not addressed in this study.<br><br>
However, in accordance with this hypothesis, our data do<br>
\	— .,<br>
demonstrate that, the suPAR level is higher in patients with more advanced HIV-1 infection.<br>
The striking correlation between suPAR levels and the risk  of  disease  progression  may  suggest  a  direct relevance of uPAR in HIV-1 infection. The natural high-affinity ligand of uPAR, uPA, has been shown to bind HIV-1 gp!20 and promote HIV-1 infection of macrophages in vitro  (27).  The  interaction between uPA and gp!20 involves the functionally important V3-loop of gp!20 and the catalytic domain of uPA,  but  leaves  the ligand binding domain of uPA free for interaction with uPAR (27) . It is thus possible that uPA may form a "bridge" between gp!20 on the virus and uPAR on the cell surface which would identify uPAR as a cellular co-receptor for HIV-1. Indeed, it should be noted that the major cell types susceptible to HIV-1 infection are those in which uPAR is predominantly expressed (macrophages, activated monocytes ..and T-cells).._ Inyestigatipris addressing such an involvement now seem highly warranted.<br>
Finally, it should be emphasized that circulating suPAR might play a direct role in the pathogenesis of HIV-1 infection. .In fact, suPAR fragments have chemokine-like. activities and suPAR is capable of modulating processes such as cell adhesion, migration, and proliferation in vitro (1, 34) .<br>
Regardless of the biological explanation, the serum level of suPAR remains a strong and independent prognostic predictor of disease progression in HIV-1 infection. Using a single serum suPAR measurement and arbitrary cutoff points we were able to define patient groups associated with different hazard, ratios for disease progression, suggesting that suPAR measurements may be<br><br>
used as a prognostic tool in HIV-1 infection.<br>
v<br>
The variables suPAR, CD4 count and viral load were only poorly correlated mutually and all three parameters provided highly significant independent prognostic information in multivariate Cox analysis. This implies that suPAR provides important additional prognostic information. In this respect it will be particularly important to determine if suPAR is useful in determining if and when to initiate highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART).<br>
There is  still  considerable debate,  as  reflected in different national guidelines, about what combination of CD4 count and viral load constitutes an indication for therapy. Virologic and immunologic arguments for early initiation  of  therapy need  to  be  balanced  against disadvantages of treatment such as lifelong polypharmacy, high  costs,  side  effects,  and  risk  of  resistance development.  As: __ the_.....suP.AR_. level - carries  strong and independent information on the progression status, it may aid in the monitoring of patients and in the important clinical decision of when to initiate HAART.<br>
In the current study follow-up was censored at the date when the first patient in the cohort received a protease inhibitor, and the patients therefore only received relative light anti-retroviral treatment as compared to HAART. The treatment with anti-retroviral drugs at the time of enrolment in CHIC was associated with poor survival in univariate Cox analysis, but failed to provide significant prognostic information in multivariate Cox analysis. This most likely reflects the fact that patients who had received treatment at the time of enrolment were those with a more advanced disease for whom mono- or dual- therapy did not provide a strong<br><br>
survival benefit. The present study is therefore likely to reflect disease development close to the natural history course of HIV-1 infection and the possible prognostic value of suPAR in the context of HAART should be addressed in other more appropriately designed studies.<br>
Although the present study shows a strong association between suPAR levels and disease progression it is important to realize that the amount of data from this single study does not justify suggestions of using suPAR as a standard prognostic parameters. First the data needs to be confirmed in an independent cohort. Secondly since this cohort consists of patients in a European country before the HAART era its value needs to be confirmed in patients with access to HAART treatment and/or in resource poor settings. This study makes use of arbitrarily chosen cut-off values and statistical methods, which do not require the definition of specific cut-off values. Normal values of suPAR obtained using standardized sample techniques needs to be determined before routine use of suPAR can be applied.<br>
It has recently been shown that suPAR antigen can be readily quantified in urine, and that the urinary suPAR level strongly correlates with the serum level (14) . It is therefore possible that urine may provide an alternative to serum samples for suPAR based HIV-1 prognosis, which would introduce an element of safety and convenience for both the patients and the medical staff.<br>
The introduction of HAART in the western world has profoundly increased the life expectancy of HIV-1 infected individuals. However, because of the high cost of these drugs only a small fraction of the HIV-1 infected persons in the world have access to effective<br><br>
HIV-1 therapy. The measurement of suPAR is performed using a simple 'and inexpensive ELISA technique. After confirmation of our results in other groups of patients, the determination of suPAR in serum (or even better urine) from HIV-1 infected persons may provide a cost-effective supplement or alternative to the currently used "decision making" tools based on CD4 counts and viral load.<br>

Example 13: Measurement of the suPAR Dl fragment<br>
Urine samples from 20 HIV positive patients undergoing HAART treatment and from 10 control persons were collected. The samples were analysed for the level of suPAR/creatinine, suPAR fragment Dl, CD4 T cell count and HIV mRNA using ELISA and Western blotting.<br>
The ELISA was carried out as in Example 1.<br>
The Western bloting was carried out using the following procedure: 100 ul of serum samples and culture medium were diluted to one ml using RIPA buffer (0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), 1% Triton X-100, 1% deoxycholate, 0.15 M NaCl and 0.05 M Tris-HCl pH 7.6) containing a cocktail of protease inhibitors (Complete, Boehringer, Mannheim). The samples were immunoprecipitated for 16 hours at 4°C using biotinylated monoclonal antibodies R2,<br><br>
R3  or  both  and  immobilized  on  streptavidin  coated<br>
beads(Boehringer,  Mannheim).  After washing with RIPA buffer the absorbed material was eluted by boiling in non-reducing  sample  buffer  and  the  proteins  were separated by 12% SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred to PVDF membranes (Immobilon-P, Millipore) and probed with a rabbit  polyclonal  anti-uPAR  antibody.  The  immune-complexes were visualized by incubation with a peroxidase conjugated donkey anti-rabbit antibody  (Amersham)  and chemoluminescent  detection  (SuperSignal  Ultra,  Pierce Chemicals).<br>
The results are shown in Figures 17-20.<br>
From Figure 17 it may be concluded that the level of suPAR is significantly higher for the HIV positive group than for the control group (p=0.003).<br>
Figures 18 and 19 show that the presence of Dl is independent from the CD 4 T cell- count ^ and the ^suPAR level, respectively.<br>
Figure 20 shows that the presence of Dl significantly correlates to the level of HIV mRNA. Also, the presence of Dl is significantly more often found in patients who have detectable HIV RNA.<br>
Only one person from the control group had a detectable level of Dl.<br>
Example 14: The expression of uPAR on PBMC correlates with serum level of suPAR<br>
Background The aim of this example is to determine whether there is a significant relationship between<br><br>
surface expression of uPAR and serum level of suPAR.<br>
Methods: Blood was collected from 10 healthy blood donors attending the donor clinic at Hvidovre Hospital. The serum was collected and suPAR concentration measured using ELISA. Periphery blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) was collected using Histopaq gradient centrifugation, and the expression of CD87 was measured using R2 antibody and a secondary FITC conjugated antibody against mouse antibody. An idiotypic negative control antibody~was included as control of specificity.<br>
Results: The results are shown in Figure 21. The Y-axis on the left show the serum level of suPAR (ng/ml) . The Y axis on the right shows the percentage of cells expressing the uPAR receptor (CD87 positive cells) . All blood donors had measurable uPAR receptor on the PBMC and measurable suPAR in serum. In eight of ten patients (p
Discussion. The results show a significant relationship between PBMC surface expression of• uPAR (CD87) and the serum level of suPAR. Thus, it is therefore reasonable to assume that the surface expression of uPAR is a strong prognostic factor in HIV infection. The use of uPAR as a marker involves the advantage that uPAR can be-measured along with the CD4 T cell count, e.g. by FACS, in routine measurements of HIV infected individuals and thereby add valuable information regarding the patients progression status.<br><br>

CLAIMS<br>
1. A method of diagnosing and/or prognosticating HIV infection in a subject comprising the steps of<br>
(a) performing in vitro a measurement of the level of a marker in the form of (i) urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR), (ii) soluble urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (suPAR), (iii) urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA), (iv) one or more degradation products of (i), (ii) or (iii), and/or (v) an mRNA for (i), (ii) or (iii), in a biological fluid sample from a subject, and<br>
(b) using the measurement value obtained to evaluate the state of the subject.<br>
2.	A method according to claim 1, wherein the biological<br>
fluid  sample  is  a  urine  sample,  and  wherein  the<br>
measurement of the marker is correlated to the total<br>
•concentration level of the sample.<br>
3.	A method according to claim 1 or 2, wherein step a) is<br>
effected by means of a stick.<br>
4.	A method according to claim 1 or 2, wherein step a) is<br>
effected using ELISA.<br>
5.	A method of evaluating the progression of the state of<br>
a subject suffering from HIV infection comprising the<br>
steps of<br>
(a) performing in vitro a measurement of the level of a marker in the form of (i) urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR), (ii) soluble urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (suPAR), (iii) urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA), (iv) one or more degradation<br>
products of (i),  (ii) or (iii), and/or (v) an mRNA for (i),  (ii) or (iii), in each of a number of biological fluid samples from a subject, wherein -the samples are obtained at different points in time, and (b) using the measurement values obtained to evaluate the progression of the state of the subject.<br>
6.	A method according to claim 5, wherein the subject<br>
evaluated is in treatment.<br>
7.	A method according to claim 6, wherein the subject is<br>
in highly active anti-retroviral therapy (-HAART) .<br>
8.	An ELISA-kit for evaluating the physical state of a<br>
subject suffering from HIV infection comprising a) an<br>
immobilised capture agent capable of capturing a marker<br>
in  the  form of  (i)  urokinase  plasminogen- activator<br>
receptor  (uPAR) ,   (ii)  soluble  urokinase  plasminogen<br>
activator   receptor   (suPAR),   (iii)   urokinase-type<br>
plasminogen activator (uPA) , (iv) one or more degradation<br>
products of (i) ,  (ii) _ or (iii), and/or (v) an mRNA for<br>
(i), (ii) or (iii), and b) a binding partner capable of<br>
binding  to  the  said  marker,  the  binding  partner comprising c) a label system.<br>
9. A stick-kit for evaluating the physical state of a subject suffering from HIV infection comprising a) an immobilised capture agent capable of capturing a marker in the  form of  (i)  urokinase plasminogen activator receptor  (uPAR) , . (ii)  soluble  urokinase  plasminogen activator   receptor   (suPAR),   (iii)   urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA), (iv) one or more degradation products of (i),  (ii) or (iii), and/or (v) an mRNA for (i) ,-• (ii) or (iii), and. .b) a^ binding partner capable of binding  to  the  said  marker,  the  binding  partner -comprising c) a label system.<br>
10.	A kit according to claim 8 or 9, wherein the capture<br>
agent is an antibody to the marker.<br>
11.	A kit according to claim 8 or 9, wherein the binding<br>
partner is an antibody to the marker.<br></td>
