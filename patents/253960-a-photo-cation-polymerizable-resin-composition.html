				<td>The present invention relates to a photo cation polymerizable resin composition.<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a cation polymerizable resin composition excellent in curing during polymerization, which is used as an adhesive for optical disk requiring dimensional accuracy, a coating material, and an adhesive for protective sheet.<br>
Background Art<br>
Epoxy resin is superior in heat resistance, adhesiveness, water resistance, mechanical strength and electrical properties, and is used in semiconductor sealing resin, laminate resin, coating material, adhesive, ink and various sealing materials. A method of curing the epoxy resin includes a method of using a curing agent such as an acid anhydride, amine compound, isocyanate compound and phenolic compound and polymerization reaction (addition reaction) of epoxy resin itself ,that is, a photo/thermosetting system by cation polymerization.<br>
As the curing system using cation polymerization, the cation polymerization which involves using not only the epoxy resin but also oxetane resin, vinyl ethers and styrene or derivatives thereof is known, and particularly the cation polymerization using epoxy res in and oxetane resin is extensively examined.<br><br>
Among optical recording media, DVD (digital video disk or digital versatile disk) capable of recording large-capacity information attracts attention in recent years, and techniques wherein the memory capacity of one side of an optical disk is increased to 20 to 30 G bytes by utilizing a blue-violet laser light source at a wavelength of 405 nm and reducing a protective layer covering the recording layer to 0.1 to 0.3 mm are proposed (Japanese Journal Applied Physics, Vol. 30 (2000) ) .  This DVD, unlike a conventional structure wherein two disks are attached, is composed fundamentally of one disk, and thus requires a surface protective layer . With respect to a material of this protective layer, Japanese Journal Applied Physics, Vol. 39, 775-778 (2000) shows (i) a method that involves spin-coating a photo cation polymerizable resin composition onto an optical disk and then irradiating it with UV rays in a nitrogen atmosphere to form a protective layer and (ii) a method that involves spin-coating a photo cation polymerizable resin composition onto a polycarbonate sheet, attaching it to an optical disk and irradiating it with UV rays to form a protective layer.<br>
The performance required by these protecting coatings is that for recording with a blue-violet laser at 405 nm as a light source, the protective coating has excellent light transmittance at 405 nm and specifically requires 90% light transmittance. It is also desired that after spin coating or attachment of a polycarbonate sheet, thebasepolycarbonateplate isnot deformed by curing upon irradiation with UV rays, and it is thus desired that the cure shrinkage of the surface protective material for<br>
optical disk is low. From this viewpoint, photo cation polymerization is preferably used in ring-opening polymerization. Further, there is a high degree of freedom in design of hardness by regulation of crosslinking density.<br>
However, the cation polymerization system is poor in polymerizability as compared with the previously mentioned acid anhydrides and amines. Accordingly, this polymerizability is extensively studied. Examples of proposed methods include a method of increasing polymerizability by using oxetane resin in combination with epoxy resin according to Fine Chemical, Vol. 29, No. 19, 5, 2000, a method of using hydrogenated epoxy resin described in JP-A 2001-261780, a method of using cyclohexene oxide described in JP-A 2001-316450, and a system wherein vinyl ether is combined with a weak base as proposed in JP-A 2 000-109511. There is also an easier method which comprises adding a large amount of a catalyst for cation polymerization.<br>
In the method of using oxetane resin, the rate of polymerization can be increased, but the initiation reaction itself should be coped by increasing the amount of a catalyst added, by simultaneously using epoxy resin, or by using higher energy, and there are problems such as deterioration of water resistance and coloration of resin caused by ionic components derived from the catalyst. In the method of using the hydrogenated epoxy resin having hydroxyl groups, there is a limit to use of epoxy resin having other skeletons used to exhibit functions . The method of using cyclohexene oxide has the problem of significant cure shrinkage . In the system wherein vinyl ether<br>
is combined with a weak base, the weak base not forming a chemical bond with resin is added after curing, and thus there is the problem of inferior water resistance. It is found that when the amount of the catalyst for cation polymerization is increased, water resistance and corrosion resistance are significantly deteriorated.<br>
Disclosure of Invention<br>
The object of the present invention is to provide a cation polymerizable resin composition excellent in curing properties and corrosion resistance with less resin coloration and less cure shrinkage to solve the problems described above, as well as a material suitable as an optical disk-protecting material.<br>
As a result of extensive study to solve the problems described above, the present inventors attracted their attention on the formation of oxonium ion by a cation ring-opening polymerizable compound in initiation reaction and on the stability of the oxonium ion. They attracted their attention on activation energy as a measure of the stability until formation of a ring-opened product upon adding methyl cation to cyclic ether compounds. Specifically, they conducted comparison and examination based on primary principle calculation, and as a result they found that the conventional photo cation polymerization can be activated by energy under specific activation energy. Particularly, they found that an epoxy compound represented by formula 1 can initiate the reaction easily with the lowest activation energy.<br>
Further, the present inventors paid attention to the fact that the polymerization initiation step of photo cation polymerization is mediated by radicals, and examined various radial initiators, and as a result, they found that a specific photo radical polymerization initiator can be simultaneously used in further activating the reaction, and has a higher polymerization ability than in the system using oxetane or a derivative thereof which has been considered excellent in polymerizability, to exhibit curing properties comparative to those in the radical polymerization system.  Further, the inventors found that a cation polymerizable resin having a specific molecular-weight range can be blended to give a surface protective material for optical disk requiring high dimensional accuracy, and the inventors thereby achieved the object and arrived at the present invention.<br>

Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention Hereinafter, the present invention is described in more detail.<br>
The compound (A) in the present invention is a group of compounds whose ring-opening polymerizability in polymerization of cation ring-opening polymerizable compound was compared and examined by using a model of the reaction of<br>
addition of methyl cation to a cyclic compound. Specifically, the activation energy in the reaction route shown in Fig. 1 was calculated by using primary principle calculation, and the results are shown in Table 1. The results indicated that there is a cyclic ether structure having lower activation energy than those of conventionally frequently used epoxy compounds, oxetane compounds and alicyclic epoxy compounds, and the activation energy is preferably 15 kcal/mol, and particularly the structure is preferably an epoxy compound having a structure represented by formula 1: [Formula 1](Formula Removed)<br>
wherein R1 and R2 each represent a saturated or unsaturated carbon atom, and R3 represents a hydrogen atom or a saturated or unsaturated carbon atom.<br>
This structure is instable in the form of an oxonium ion formed upon initiation of cation ring-opening polymerization, and easily rearranged into a highly active carbonium ion so that polymerization immediately proceeds . On the other hand, cyclic ethers having other structures have higher activation energy, and thus they advantageously occur in the form of an oxonium ion without undergoing ring opening, thus lowering polymerizability.<br>
The epoxy compound represented by formula 1 is an epoxy<br>
compound wherein among carbon atoms constituting anoxirane ring, one carbon atom is substituted with at least one hydrogen atom, and one of the other carbon atoms is substituted with two carbon atoms, and the substituent carbon atoms are saturated or unsaturated bonds [literal translation] . The saturated or unsaturated bond of the carbon atom may be substituted with an arbitrary atomic group.<br>
