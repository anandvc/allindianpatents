				<td>Silyiethynylated Heteroacenes<br>
And Electronic Devices Made Therewith<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates generally to the field of organic<br>
semiconductors and, more particularly, to silyiethynylated heteroacenes as<br>
well as to formulations and electronic devices made with these<br>
compounds.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Display technology is expected to become a dominant sector of high-tech<br>
industry in the future. It is also expected that the fiat panel display<br>
technology will be revolutionized by the use of organic semiconductors that<br>
will allow manufacture of cheap, flexible, lightweight, fully portable flat<br>
panel displays with no apparent limits to their size. It is predicted that due<br>
to the lower manufacturing cost, organic semiconductor based displays will<br>
eventually gain dominance over amorphous silicon based counterparts and<br>
the respective market share will grow to $1.6 billion by 2007. To realize<br>
these goals, however, significant breakthroughs will have to take place in<br>
the area of organic semiconductor material and device processing.<br>
Interest in organic thin film transistors (OTFTs) for possible use in displays,<br>
sensors and other large area electronic applications has been increasing<br>
rapidiy. Best reported organic thin film transistor (OTFT) device<br>
performance rivals or exceeds that of hydrogenated amorphous silicon<br>
devices, and low OTFT process temperatures allow fabrication on a range<br>
of surfaces including cloth, paper or lower temperature polymeric<br>
substrates.<br>
Organic semiconductors for use in OTFTs can be broadly divided into two<br>
groups as high and low mobility materials. High mobility materials have<br>
mobility &gt; 0.1 cm2/V-s, usefully large carrier energy bandwidth (&gt; 0.1 eV)<br>
and weak or sometimes absent temperature activation of mobility. To date,<br>
most high mobility organic semiconductors have been small molecule<br>
materials (with pentacene the most notable example) and most have been<br>
deposited by vacuum sublimation or from a solution precursor with a high-<br>
temperature (&gt; 150Â° C) conversion step. Low mobility materials have<br>
mobility from about 10-5 - 10-1 cm2/V-s, typically transport carriers by<br>
hopping, and have strong temperature activation of mobility. Most<br>
polymeric organic semiconductors fall into this group and many have the<br>
potential advantage that they can be deposited from solution.<br>
To date, there have been few reports of low-temperature solution<br>
processed organic semiconductors with high mobility. In addition, even for<br>
low mobility materials, current solution deposition techniques have not<br>
demonstrated material structure, thickness and property control<br>
comparable to vacuum deposition techniques.<br>
It was an aim of the present invention to provide new organic<br>
semiconductor compounds with advantageous properties, especially with<br>
relatively low OTFT process temperatures and relatively high mobility.<br>
Another aim of the present invention was to extend the pool of organic<br>
semiconductor compounds available to the person skilled in the art. Other<br>
aims of the present invention are immediately evident to the person skilled<br>
in the art from the following detailed description.<br>
It was found that these aims can be achieved by providing novel<br>
silylethynylated heteroacenes as claimed in the present invention.<br>
M. Payne, S. Odom, R. Parkin, J. Anthony, Org. Lett. 2004, Vol. 6, No. 19,<br>
p.3325-3328, discloses silylethynylated heteroacenes, but does not<br>
disclose compounds according to the present invention.<br>

Reference will now be made in detail to the present preferred<br>
embodiments of the invention as illustrated in the accompanying drawing<br>
figures.<br>
Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
The novel compounds of the present invention may be broadly described<br>
as silylethynylated heteroacenes (anthra(diheterocycles),<br>
tetra(diheterocycles) and penta(diheterocycles) compounds).<br>
Preferred compounds of formula I are those wherein Y1 = Y3 and Y2 = Y4,<br>
and those wherein Y1 = Y4 and Y2 = Y3.<br>
Preferred compounds of formula I are selected from the following<br>
formulae:<br>
wherein R, R' and X are as defined above.<br>
In accordance with yet another aspect of the present invention a<br>
formulation comprising one or more of the novel compounds of formula I,<br>
A1, A2, B1, B2, C1 or C2 and one or more solvents is provided. The<br>
solvents are preferably organic solvents, very preferably selected from<br>
alkylated and/or fluorinated or chlorinated benzenes like toluene, xylene<br>
and the like, anisole or its alkylated and/or fluorinated derivatives, tetralin,<br>
indane, decalin, N,N-dimethylaniline, N-methylpyrrolidone, N,N-<br>
dimethylformamide or pyridine.<br>
In accordance with yet another aspect of the present invention a transistor<br>
is provided. The transistor preferably comprises a gate electrode, a<br>
semiconductor constructed from the novel compounds or formulations of<br>
the present invention, an insulator between the gate electrode and the<br>
semiconductor, a source electrode and a drain electrode.<br>
in accordance with yet another aspect of the present invention, a<br>
photovoltaic device is provided. The photovoltaic device preferably<br>
comprises a transparent anode, a semiconductor constructed from the<br>
novel compounds or formulations of the present invention, an n-type<br>
material and a cathode.<br>
Suitable methods and materials for preparing electronic devices like<br>
transistors and photovoltaic devices and their components, like for<br>
example the gate, source or drain electrode, cathode, anode or n-type<br>
material (electron transporter), are known to the person skilled in the art<br>
and are described in the literature, for example in WO 02/45184 A1, WO<br>
03/052841 A1, WO 2004/013922 A2 and the references cited therein.<br>
Very preferred are compounds of formulae I, A1, A2, B1, B2, C1 and C2<br>
wherein<br>
- X is -O-,-Se-or-NH-,<br>
- X is -S-,<br>
- R' is not H,<br>
- R' is F, CI, Br or COOH, very preferably F, CI or Br, most preferably F,<br>

perfluorinated aryl having 6 to 30 C-atoms, preferably C6F5, F, CI, Br, I,<br>
CN and CO2R", very preferably from F, CI and Br.<br>
The silylethynylated heteroacenes are usually prepared as a mixture of<br>
isomers. Formula I thus covers isomer pairs wherein in the first isomer Y1<br>
= Y3 and Y2 = Y4, and in the second isomer Y1 = Y4 and Y2 = Y3.<br>
Formulae A1 and A2 represent the two isomers of anthra (diheterocycles).<br>
Formulae B1 and B2 represent the two isomers of tetra (diheterocycles).<br>
Formulae C1 and C2 represent the two isomers of penta (diheterocycles).<br>
The novel compounds of the present invention include both the mixture of<br>
the isomers of formulae A1, A2; B1, B2; or C1, C2 and the pure isomers<br>
A1, A2, B1, B2, C1 or C2.<br>
The isomers A1, A2, B1, B2, C1 or C2 may be purified from the mixture of<br>
isomers of formulae A1, A2; B1, B2; or C1, C2 by methods known to those<br>
skilled in the art including but not limited to high-performance liquid<br>
chromatography (HPLC).<br>
The novel compounds of the present invention can be prepared by a<br>
relatively simple and straightforward method. Specifically, the<br>
silylethynylated heteroacenes are easily made by the addition of an<br>
alkynyllithium to the corresponding acenequinone, followed by reductive<br>
workup with either HI or tin (II) chloride:<br><br>
This type of reaction is well-described in:<br>
Miller, G. P.; Mack, J.; Briggs, J. Org. Lett. 2000, 2, 3983,<br>
Anthony, J, E,; Eaton, D. L; Parkin, S. R. Org. Lett, 2002, 4, 15,<br>
Anthony, J. E.; Brooks, J. S.; Eaton, D. L.; Parkin, S. J. Am. Chem, Soc.<br>
2001, 123, 9482,<br>
Payne, M M.; Odom, S. A.; Parkin, S. R.; Anthony, J..E. Org. Lett. 2004<br>
6, 3325.<br>
The acenequinone is very easily prepared by a 4-fold aldol condensation<br>
between a dialdehyde and commercially-available 1,4-cyclohexanedione:<br><br>
This condensation is well-described in;<br>
De ia Cruz, P.; Martin, N.; Miguel, F.; Seoane, C; Albert, A.; Cano, H.;<br>
Gonzalez, A.; Pingarron, J. M. J. Org. Chem. 1992, 57, 6192.<br>
The "R" group of these dialdehydes is typically installed by the following<br>
sequence:<br><br>
This procedure is described for thiophene dialdehyde in detail in:<br>
Laquindanura, J. G.; Katz, H. E.; Lovinger, A. J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998,<br>
120, 664.<br>
Compounds of the present invention wherein R' is halogen, e.g. F or Br,<br>
can be prepared according to or in analogy to reaction schemes 1 and 2:<br>
Scheme 1<br>
Thus the "base unit" for all of these materials is the heterocyclic<br>
dialdehyde. Many of these heterocyclic dialdehydes are known in the<br>
literature, and some are even commercially available:<br>
Thiophene 2,3-dialdehyde is commercially available from Aldrich and<br>
Acros chemical.<br>
Furan 2,3-dialdehyde is prepared as described in Zaluski, M. C; Robba,<br>
M.; Bonhomme, M. Bull. Chim. Soc. Fr. 1970, 4,1445.<br>
Selenophene 2,3-dialdehyde is prepared as described in Paulmier, C;<br>
Morel, J.; Pastour, P.; Scmard, D. Bull. Chim. Soc. Fr. 1969, 7, 2511.<br>
Other heterocyclic dialdehydes can be prepared by the same methods<br>
outlined for the synthesis of the furan and selenophene compounds. The<br>
following synthesis and examples are prepared to further illustrate the<br>
invention, but it is not to be considered as limited thereto.<br>
A number of useful electronic devices may be constructed from the novel<br>
compounds of the present invention. A typical field effect transistor (FET)<br>
according to the present invention (10) is illustrated in Figure 1a. The FET<br>
(10) is comprised of.a gate electrode (12) of a type known in the art, an<br>
insulator or gate dielectric (14) also of a type known in the art and a<br>
semiconductor (16) in the form of a thin layer or film of the compounds of<br>
the present invention. In addition, the FET (10) includes a conductive<br>
source electrode (18) and a drain electrode (20) both operatively<br>
connected to the semiconductor (16).<br>
The insulator (14) may, for example, be a dielectric or metal oxide or even<br>
an insulating polymer like polymethylmethacrylate). The conducting<br>
source and drain electrodes (18), (20) may be metals known in the art to<br>
be useful as electrodes, heavily doped semiconductors such as silicon or<br>
even a conducting polymer.<br>
The FET illustrated in Figure 1a is known as a bottom-gate, top-contact<br>
configuration. An alternative embodiment of the FET (10) of the present<br>
invention is illustrated in Figure 1b. This configuration is known as a<br>
bottom-gate, bottom-contact configuration.<br>
Another alternative embodiment of the FET (10) of the present invention is<br>
illustrated in Figure 1c. This configuration is known as a top-gate<br>
configuration, and is comprised of a substrate (22) of a type known in the<br>
art, a conductive source electrode (18) and a drain electrode (20), both<br>
operatively connected to a semiconductor (16) in the form of a thin layer or<br>
film of the compounds of the present invention, an insulator or gate<br>
dielectric (14) of a type known in the art, and a gate electrode (12) also of<br>
a type known in the art.<br>
The gate electrode (12), source electrode (18) and drain electrode (20)<br>
may again be any sort of conductor gold, silver, aluminum, platinum,<br>
heavily-doped silicon or an organic conducting polymer. The insulator or<br>
gate dielectric (14) can be an oxide such as aluminum oxide or silicone<br>
oxide or an insulating polymer such as polymethylmethacrylate). In either<br>
configuration the compound of the present invention may be applied either<br>
by solution or vapor methods to form the semiconductor (16).<br>
Optionally the semiconductor (16) comprises one or more organic binders,<br>
preferably polymeric binders, as described for example in WO<br>
2005/055248 A1, to adjust the rheological properties, preferably in a<br>
proportion of binder to semiconductor from 20:1 to 1:20, preferably 10:1 to<br>
1:10, more preferably 5:1 to 1:5 by weight. The binder polymers may also<br>
be semiconducting.<br>
A typical photovoltaic apparatus according to the present invention (22) is<br>
illustrated in Figure 2a. The photovoltaic apparatus (22) comprises a<br>
transparent conductive electrode or anode (24), a semiconductor (26) in<br>
the form of a thin layer or film of the compound of the present invention<br>
and a bottom electrode or cathode (28).<br>
In the photovoltaic apparatus embodiment illustrated in Figure 2a, a layer<br>
(30) of n-type material is provided between the semiconductor (26) and the<br>
cathode (28). In the photovoltaic apparatus (22) illustrated in Figure 2b the<br>
semiconductor (26) comprises the compound of the present invention<br>
blended with an n-type material.<br>
In the case of organic solar cells, the compounds of the present invention<br>
are typically used as the hole transporter (the "p-type" material). This<br>
material must be used in conjunction (i.e. as a blend) with an n-type <br>
material, defined as any electron-accepting compound. Suitable and<br>
preferred examples for n-type or acceptor materials are fullerenes like<br>
C60, or solubilized derivatives thereof, or perylene diimides like PTCBI<br>
(3,4,9,10-perylenetetracarboxylic bisbenzimidazole).<br>
The photovoltaic apparatus (22) can typically be constructed in the two<br>
ways illustrated in Figures 2a and 2b. As illustrated in Figure 2a, the p-<br>
type compound and the n-type compound are both deposited from vapor<br>
or solution in sequential steps, leading to a single heterojunction interface.<br>
Alternatively, as illustrated in Figure 2b, the p-type material and the n-type<br>
material may be mixed and deposited from solution on the anode prior to<br>
deposition of the cathode material. In this embodiment the p-type and n-<br>
type materials phase segregate, leading to multiple heterojunctions in the<br>
bulk. In both cases the anode material typically has a high work function<br>
and is transparent (ITO or (10) oxide on glass or plastic). In contrast, the<br>
cathode (28) is a low work function conductor, and is typically reflective to<br>
improve efficiency (aluminum, silver or an indium-gallium eutectic). In<br>
either case the anode layer can be pre-coated with a commercial<br>
conducting polymer like PEDOT (poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)) or a<br>
blend of PEDOT:PSS (poly(styrenesulfonate)) in order to improve charge<br>
injection efficiency.<br>
The following examples are intended to explain the invention without<br>
restricting it. The methods, structures and properties described hereinafter<br>
can also be applied or transferred to materials that are claimed in this<br>
invention but not explicitly described in the foregoing specification or in the<br>
examples.<br>
Unless stated otherwise, above and below percentages are per cent by<br>
weight and temperatures are given in degrees Celsius.<br>
Example 1<br>

To an oven-dried 250-mL round-bottom flask equipped with a stir bar and<br>
cooled under N2 was added hexanes (20 ml) and 0.38 mL of triethyisilyl<br>
acetylene (2.0 mmol), followed by the dropwise addition of 0.73 ml of<br>
n-BuLi (1.8 mmol, 2.46 M solution in hexanes). This mixture was stirred for<br>
1 h, then hexanes (60 ml) and anthradithiophenequinone (prepared by<br>
method described in De la Cruz, P. et al. J. Org. Chem. 1992, 57,6192.)<br>
(0.16 g, 0.34 mmol) were added. The mixture was heated at 60Â° C<br>
overnight, then quenched with 0.5 mL of water. SnCl2 2H2O (0.50 g, 2.2<br>
mmol) in 10 % aq. HCI (1 ml) was added and the mixture was stirred for 2<br>
h at 60Â° C. The solution was dried over MgSO4, then loaded onto a thick<br>
pad of silica. The silica was rinsed with hexanes (500 ml), then the product<br>
was eluted using hexanes: DCM (5:1). Removal of solvent yielded 0.18 g<br>
(0.31 mmol, 91 %) of a reddish powder. Recrystallization from hexanes<br>
yielded thick dark-red plates. Recrystallized 3x from hexanes. Yield: 91 %.<br>

dissolved in THF (200 ml) in a 500-ml round-bottom flask with a stir bar,<br>
then 1,4-cyclohexanedione (0.83 g, 7.40 mmol) was added and the<br>
solution was stirred until uniform. After the addition of 15 % KOH (2 ml),<br>
precipitate began to form immediately, and vigorous stirring was continued<br>
overnight. The solution was filtered to yield 3.87 g of a light brown powder<br>
made up of insoluble quinones which were used directly in the next step:<br>
MS (70 eV, El) m/z 370 (100 %, M+).<br>
5,13-Bis(tris(trimethylsilyl)silylethynyl)tetra[2,3-b:8,9-b']dithiophene<br>
and 5,13-Bis(tris(trimethylsilyl)sl/ylethynyl)tetra[2,3-b:9,8-<br>
b+]dithiophene.<br>
To an oven-dried 500-mL round-bottom flask cooled under N2 and<br>
equipped with a stir bar was added hexanes (150 ml) and<br>
tris((trimethylsily1)silyl acetylene (14 g, 51.1 mmol). n-BuLi (19.5 ml,<br>
47,9 mmol, 2.6 M in hexanes) was added dropwise and the mixture was<br>
stirred for 2 hr. The above quinone mixture (3.87 g) was added and stirring<br>
was continued overnight, followed by the addition of anhydrous THF (20<br>
ml) and additional stirring for 2 d. Water (2 ml) and a solution of SnCI2-<br>
H2O (10.0 g, 44 mmol) in 10 % HCI (20 ml) was added and the solution<br>
was stirred for 2 hr. DCM (100 ml) was then added and the organic layer<br>
was separated, dried over MgSO4, and rinsed through a thin pad of silica<br>
(DCM). Solvent was concentrated to a volume of 10 ml, then diluted with<br>
hexanes (200 ml), and rinsed onto a thick pad of silica. The silica was<br>
rinsed with hexanes (600 ml), then hexanes: DCM (1:1) to elute the<br>
product mixture, and solvent was removed from this second fraction.<br>
Using column chromatography (hexanesrethyl acetate (9:1)), 0.82 g of the<br>
desired tetradithiophene were isolated. The tetradithiophene was<br>
recrystallized from acetone to yield dark-blue needles. 1H-NMR (400 MHz,<br>

was added dropwise and the solution was stirred for 1 hr, then the<br>
abovementioned quinone (1.6 g, 3,8 mmol) was added. After stirring for 24<br>
hr, additional anhydrous THF (40 ml) was added and stirring was<br>
continued for 3 days. Water (2 ml) and a solution of SnCI2 â¢ H2O (1.0 g, 4.4<br>
mmol) in 10 % HCI (2 ml) was added and the solution was stirred for 2 hr.<br>
DCM (200 ml) was added and the organic layer was separated, dried over<br>
MgSO4, and rinsed through a thin pad of silica (DCM). Solvent was<br>
concentrated to a volume of 10 ml then diluted with hexanes (200 ml). This<br>
solution was poured onto a thick pad of silica and rinsed with hexanes<br>
(500 ml), then hexanes:DCM (1:1) to elute the product. Removal of solvent<br>
yielded 0.44 g (0.53 mmol, 14 %) of product as a sparingly-soluble green<br>

Step 1: 5-bromo-thiophene-2,3-dicarbaldehyde.<br>
2,3-Bis(1,3-dioxolan-2-yl)thiophene (13.51 g, 59.2 mmol) was dissolved in<br>
THF (200 ml), followed by the addition of N-bromosuccinimide (11.0 g,<br>
61.2 mmol). This mixture was stirred in the absence of light overnight (~15<br>
h), then water ( 300 ml) was added and the product was extracted with<br>
ether (3 x 200 ml). The organic phases were combined and washed with<br>
sat. aq. NaHCO3 solution and brine, then dried over Na2SO4. The solvent<br>
was removed under reduced pressure. The residue was dissolved in THF<br>
(150 ml) then 2N HCI solution (40 ml) was added. This mixture was heated<br>
at reflux for 1 h. After cooling to room temperature, the reaction mixture<br>
was poured into water (300 ml) and extracted with ether (3 x 200 ml). The<br>
extracts were combined and washed with sat. aq. NaHCO3, water and<br>
brine, then dried over Na2SO4. The solvent was removed under reduced<br>
pressure. The residue was purified by column chromatography, eluting<br>

The compounds of the present invention demonstrate remarkable physical<br>
and electronic properties. The silyl acetylene unit substituted on the inner<br>
aromatic ring serves two important purposes. First it lends solubility to the<br>
molecule, allowing processing by simple, solution-based methods.<br>
Secondly and perhaps more importantly, this functional group causes the<br>
molecules to self-assemble into it-stacked arrays that are critical to<br>
improved device performance. More specifically, this molecular<br>
arrangement leads to improved conductivity, reduced band gap and field<br>
effect transistors (FETs) devices with a hole mobility of 0.001 to more than<br>
1.0 cm2/Vs.<br>
Example 6<br>
A field effect transistor as shown in Figure 1a was provided. The substrate<br>
for the field-effect transistor consisted of a heavily-doped SI wafer with<br>
thermally grown oxide layer (370 ran), serving as gate electrode and<br>
dielectric. Gold source and drain contacts were evaporated to yield devices<br>
with channel length of 22 urn and channel width of 340 urn. The gold<br>
electrodes were then treated with pentafluorobenzenethiol to improve the<br>
electrode interface. A 1 - 2 wt% solution of the triethylsilyt<br>
anthradithiophene derivative of Example 1 in toluene was spread across<br>
the device surface using a plastic blade, and the solvent allowed to<br>
evaporate. The devices were then heated in air at 90Â° C for two minutes to<br>
drive off residual solvent.<br>
The triethylsilyl anthradithiophene derivative of Example 1 formed a<br>
uniform film of excellent quality yielding hole mobility of 1.0 cm2A/s with<br>
excellent on/off current ratio (107). The performance of this material is<br>
likely due to the close p-stacked interactions in the crystal. The triethylsilyl<br>
anthradithiophene derivative adopts a 2-D p-stacking arrangement with a<br>
7t-face separation of approximately 3.25 Ã. The triethylsilyl<br>
anthradithiophene derivative was also characterized by a p-overlap of 1.57<br>
Ã2 and a lateral slip of 2.75, 1.76 Ã. All measurements were performed in<br>
air at room temperature and the mobility was calculated from the<br>
saturation currents.<br>
Example 7<br>
A field effect transistor as shown in Figure 1c was provided as follows: On<br>
a glass substrate patterned Au source and drain electrodes were provided<br>
by shadow masking. A self assembling monolayer of pentafluorobenzene-<br>
thiol (electrode injection layer) was spincoated onto the Au electrodes and<br>
washed with IPA. A semiconductor formulation was prepared by dissolving<br>
the difluoro triethylsilyl anthradithiophene derivative of Example 5 in a<br>
concentration of 2 wt.% in 4-methyl anisole. The semiconductor solution<br>
was then spincoated onto the substrate at 500 rpm for 18 seconds<br>
followed by 2000rpm for 60s at room temperature in air and the solvent<br>
was evaporated. The insulator material (CytopÂ® 809M, available from<br>
Asahi Glass) was mixed 3 parts to 2 parts of perfluorosolvent (FC75, Acros<br>
catalogue number 12380) and then spincoated onto the semiconductor<br>
giving a thickness of approximately 1 urn and the solvent was evaporated.<br>
A gold gate contact was defined over the device channel area by<br>
evaporation through a shadow mask<br>
For the electrical measurements the transistor sample was mounted in a<br>
sample holder. Microprobe connections were made to the gate, drain and<br>
source electrodes using Karl Suss PH100 miniature probe-heads. These<br>
were linked to a Hewlett-Packard 4155B parameter analyser. The drain<br>
voltage was set to -5 V and the gate voltage was scanned from +20 to -60<br>
V and back to +20 V in 1 V steps. The field effect mobility values were<br>
calculated from the gradient of the Isd (source-drain current) vs. VG (gate<br>
voltage) characteristic in the linear regime (Lin mob) and the saturation<br>
regime (Sat mob). All measurements were performed in air at room<br>
temperature. The results are summarized below:<br>
Lin mob = 1.7 cm2/Vs<br>
Sat mob = 2.2 cm2/Vs<br>
On/Off ratio 103<br>
