FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to an image guided whole body stereotactic needle placement device. More particularly it relates to a computerized tomography (CT) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) compatible image guided stereotactic device useful for inserting needles or any such apparatus/ medical devices through the said needle at a desired precise point in the body.<br>
In medical field it is very often necessary to precisely position a needle or a medical device through a needle at a particular part of the body or an organ deep inside the body. This is required for obtaining tissue samples for the purpose of diagnosis by histological/biochemical/immunological or any other tests on the obtained samples or for delivering drugs/energy or for therapeutic / palliative aspiration of fluid collections or any such procedure.<br>
This can be done percutaneously under image guidance obtained from cross sectional imaging devices such as ultrasound / CT scan / MRI scan etc. Image guidance is required to select least harmful path for the needle, so as to avoid vital organs and structures such as blood vessels, bowel etc.<br>
These difficult and critical, at times life saving operations/procedures require precise placement of needle /medical devices at precise points or locations in the body while avoiding damage to other delicate organs, tissues, blood vessels etc. Although it is possible to determine exact location using various electronic, sonic or other techniques, guiding the needles to that precise point by free hand is by trial and error and often requires multiple attempts. At times despite multiple attempts it may not be possible to place the needle or such medical device in the desired precise point in the body. At times multiple<br><br><br>
attempts of passing the needle may cause serious life threatening complications of internal bleeding and/or damage to vital organs in the path of the needle or such device. This can also be better done by using needle guiding devices that can guide the needle in the precise direction so as to reach the precise point in the body in the first attempt.<br>
There are devices available for guiding the needle in a precise direction under ultrasound guidance. There are also devices available for guiding the needle for brain interventions through drilled holes in the skull. However devices available for guiding the needle for brain interventions are not suitable/compatible for use in other parts of the body.<br>
In the modern era of technology various advanced techniques such as CT and MR scanning are available for precise identification of locations needing treatment through placement of needles/medical devices through the needles or for obtaining tissue samples/body fluids. However a universal device capable of using these imaging techniques for precise placement of needles/medical devices through the needles any where in the body is not presently known and hence there is a need to develop such device.<br>
The only reference available in respect of stereo tactic device in medical field is that of a device used for brain surgery/interventions. The said device as described in US patent application No. 526805 filed on August 26, 2003 and published as publication No. 20060009787A1 on January 12, 2006 the<br>
said device comprises a frame, with puncture guides for guiding the tip of a puncturing needle to a predetermined position within the brain, and right and left fixing frames respectively having fixing needles for fixing the device on the patient head, the fixing frames being displaceable in a longitudinal direction of the frame, and the frame being provided with a plurality of guide s for guiding the tip of a puncturing needle toward a point on a line connecting the right and left fixing needles.<br><br><br>
The device provided by the abovementioned US patent cannot be used on any other part of the body as it has been designed specifically for brain surgery/interventions only.<br>
None of the existing stereotactic biopsy devices are capable of being used in body part affected by respiratory movement. In order to prevent damage to body organs and tissues in the path of the needle during respiratory movements it is mandatory to allow free movement of the needle or such device during breathing.<br>
The present invention provides a stereotactic device that obviates the above limitations.<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide an image guided stereotactic device for needle/medical device placement that could be used for interventions in the entire of the body including brain.<br>
Another object is to provide the said device which is compatible with both CT and MRI scan techniques and environment.<br>
This device can be used in patients of all ages including infants and can be used for whole body including brain and also parts of the body that move with respiration<br>
In particular aspect of the present invention the device comprises a base plate at the bottom of the device with a ridge which allows rotation of a needle holder carrying arc, a needle guide with cover for holding the needle sizing tube and a pin to hold together the needle guide, needle guide cover and needle sizing tube.<br><br><br>

In another feature the image guided whole body stereotactic needle placement device could be used in industrial applications requiring precise placement of needle / device through the needle.<br>
The whole body stereotactic needle placement device provided by the present invention may be used for any part of the human / animal body from<br><br><br>
where the sample is to be taken for diagnosis or drugs/energy are to be delivered or fluids are to be aspirated for treatment. The CT or MRI scan provide the exact location in the body where the tip of needle/medical device has to be positioned.<br>
The CT/MRI scan of the desired part of the patient's body is performed. The desired point at which the tip of needle/medical device has to be placed, the desired point of the entry and safest pathway of the needle/medical device is determined from the obtained scans. The base plate (1) is placed on the patient's body, so as to get the desired position of the entry of the needle/medical device in the centre of the working space (13). The base plate is secured to the patient's body by sutures/screws/adhesive tapes if so desired. The CT/MRI scan of the desired part of the patient's body is performed once again. The x, y, z coordinates of the fiducial markers (14) and the desired position of the needle tip/medical device in the patient's body are obtained from the software provided in the CT/MRI scanner. These co-ordinates are fed into suitable computer software, which gives the exact angles of placement of the arc (2) on the base plate (1) and of the needle guide (3) on the arc blade (15). The software also gives the distance to which the needle is to be advanced in the body. These can also be obtained by fixing these co-ordinates on a cuboidal frame specifically designed for this purpose.<br>
Based on the angles obtained by the use of software or the cuboidal frame the needle guide (3) is placed on the arc blade (15) and fixed at the precise degree markings (18) on the arc (2) and the arc foot plates (16) are placed on precise radial markings (10) and (11) on the base plate (1). Once the position of the arc (2) and the needle guide (3) is adjusted these can be secured by placing screws in the tap for screw in footplate (19) and tap for screw in needle guide (26). The needle guide cover (4) is fitted on to the needle guide (3) and secured with locking pin (5) placed through the slots in the needle guide cover (32) and the slots in the needle guide (24).<br><br><br>
A small incision appropriate to the diameter of the needle/medical device to be placed in the patient's body is made at the desired point of entry in the skin. The linear distance between the site of skin entry and the desired position of the needle tip/medical device in the patient's body has been obtained by feeding the co-ordinates of the fiducial markers (14) and the desired position of the needle tip/medical device in the patient's body in a software program / cuboidal frame.<br>
The needle sizing tube (6) with channel (37) of diameter appropriate to the diameter of the needle / medical device proposed to be used is placed into the tunnel for needle sizing tube (29) in the needle guide cover (4). The needle/medical device is advanced to the desired depth.<br>
In case the part of the body where this device is used moves with breathing, it is ensured that the patient is holding breath during passage of needle/medical device. The needle sizing tube is made free by removing the locking pin (5), needle guide cover (4), needle guide (3) and the arc (2) before allowing the patient to breath again.<br>
Once the needle/medical device tip has been positioned at the desired location in the patient's body it can be used to take samples, deliver the drugs/energy or aspirate fluids or to perform any such procedure.<br>
In cases where the placement of needle tip / medical device is not very precise, as determined by the medical practitioner using this device, the needle / medical device could be passed in the body by aligning it to the needle track indicator (23) on the front arm (22) of the needle guide (3). This will not require the use of needle guide cover (4), locking pin (5) and the needle sizing tube (6). This will allow quicker performance of the procedure.<br><br><br>
The image guided whole body stereotactic needle placement device provided by the present invention has following advantages:<br>
1.	It is CT and MR compatible<br>
2.	It enables precise placement of needle in any desired location in the body including brain, thorax, abdomen, extremities etc.<br>
3.	It allows use of varying diameter sizes of needles/medical devices.<br>
4.	Positioning of the needle could also be done in directions other than the axial plane of the body.<br>
5.	The device virtually eliminates multiple attempts to place the needle in desired location along the desired path.<br>
6.	It minimizes the morbidity and mortality of the procedure.<br>
7.	It increases the success rate of the procedure being performed.<br>
