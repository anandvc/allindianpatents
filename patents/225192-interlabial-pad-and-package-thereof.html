				<td>SPECIFICATION<br>
INTERLABIAL PAD AND PACKAGE THEREOF<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to an interlabial pad, which is used for<br>
attaching within female labia, particularly relates to the interlabial pad, which can<br>
be used together with a sanitary napkin as well as relates to a wrapping body<br>
that the interlabial pad is contained in a package for wrapping each of the<br>
interlabial pad.<br>
Background Art<br>
Conventionally, a sanitary napkin and a tampon are used generally as<br>
sanitary products for female. However, there has been problem that, as for the<br>
sanitary napkin, it is used by bringing into contact with garment, and it tends to<br>
cause the leak of menstrual blood from the gap caused by poor adhesion near<br>
the ostium vaginae. While there has been another problem that, as for the<br>
tampon, on the basis of the nature of its products, it tends to cause the foreign<br>
feeling and the discomfort, when wearing it, and it is difficult to fix into the vagina.<br>
Under such situation, sanitary products of the interlabial pad have<br>
attracted people in recent years as a sanitary product positioned between the<br>
sanitary napkin and the tampon.<br>
The interlabial pad is used by inserting its portion between the labia and<br>
bringing into contact with the labia. The interlabial pad has advantages that it<br>
excels in a wear feeling and its comfort because of being small as compared<br>
with the sanitary napkin and that it is sanitary and clean because the range of the<br>
body soiled with menstrual blood is narrow. Moreover, it has characteristics<br>
that it is difficult to cause the leak of menstrual blood because of higher adhesion<br>
to the body than that of the sanitary napkin and that psychological resistance on<br>
wearing is lower than that of the tampon which is inserted into the vagina.<br>
However, a conventional interlabial pad has had a problem that the<br>
menstrual blood flows and leaks out of the pad surface before it is absorbed by<br>
the absorber. Since the menstrual blood flows along the inner wall of labia at a<br>
slow rate with a high degree of wetting to the inner wall of the labia, the<br>
menstrual blood does not flow out of the labia gradually but also a lot of the<br>
menstrual blood flows out all at once after retention in the labia.<br>
For example, as illustrated in Fig. 2, the interlabial pad 24 has a knob 24a<br>
at the side of the garment, thereby a person can wear it easily by holding the<br>
knob 24a by fingers (the publication of WO99/56689). However, the pad<br>
disclosed by the document lacks adhesion to the inner wall of the labia, since,<br>
except for the neighborhood of the knob, it is difficult to apply press force for<br>
pushing the pad into the labia. Therefore, before the absorber absorbs the<br>
menstrual blood, the menstrual blood flows out of the pad surface, and the leak<br>
of the menstrual blood has been occurred.<br>
Further as illustrated in Fig. 3, the interlabial pad 34 is designed that the<br>
convex portion can be formed by folding a rear side area 34b along the<br>
substantial center line 36 in the longitudinal direction of the pad. As compared<br>
with the interlabial pad 24 illustrated in Fig. 2, this interlabial pad 34 can be used<br>
by putting the convex portion between labia and improves in the adhesion to the<br>
interlabial inner wall. Although the pad has the structure as described<br>
hereinbefore, the menstrual blood flows easily out of the pad surface and there<br>
has been likelihood of the leak of menstrual blood. Therefore, due to a smaller<br>
size of the interlabial pad than that of a sanitary napkin, the serious damage from<br>
the leak of menstrual blood has been caused.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
in respect of problems described hereinbefore, the object of the present<br>
invention provides an interlabial pad in capable of rapidly carrying the menstrual<br>
blood, which flows along the inner wall of the interlabial to the absorber.<br>
To solve the aforementioned problems, the present invention provides an<br>
absorbing sheet portion comprising a pair of absorbing sheet bodies which are<br>
divided along a substantial center line of the interlabial pad, the absorbing sheet<br>
body and the impermeable support sheet are bonded on a peripheral edge<br>
portion of the interlabial pad to form a void through which the menstrual blood<br>
can flow between the absorbing sheet body and the support sheet, thereby the<br>
menstrual blood which flows along an inner wall of labia is rapidly transferred<br>
into the absorber, and the shape fitness (fitting ability) in labia can increase.<br>
Concretely, the present invention provides the interlabial pad as follows;<br>
(1) An interlabial pad for attaching to labia, comprising: an absorber for<br>
absorbing a body fluid; an absorbing sheet portion facing to a body side upon<br>
wearing the interlabial pad; and a support sheet portion backing the absorbing<br>
sheet portion; wherein said absorbing sheet portion comprises a pair of<br>
absorbing sheet bodies which are separated along a substantial center line of<br>
the interlabial pad, and said absorbing sheet body is bonded to said support<br>
sheet portion comprising an impermeable support sheet on a peripheral edge<br>
portion of the interlabial pad, thereby the body fluid can flow into a void which is<br>
formed between a garment face side of the absorbing sheet body and the body<br>
face side of the support sheet.<br>
An interlabial pad of the present invention, for example, as shown in Fig.4,<br>
comprises an absorbing sheet portion 44a and a support sheet portion 44b<br>
backing the absorbing sheet 44a. The absorbing sheet 44a is used to face<br>
against the body side upon wearing. The absorbing sheet 44a includes an<br>
absorber 43 for absorbing the body fluid, for example, the menstrual blood, and<br>
a surface thereof is applied by a water permeable cover sheet 41 if desired.<br>
The absorbing sheet 44a comprises a pair of absorbing sheet bodies 46 which is<br>
divided along a substantial center line of the interlabial pad 44. While the support<br>
sheet portion 44b comprises an impermeable support sheet 42.<br>
The absorbing sheet body 46 and the support sheet 42 are bonded with<br>
each other on the peripheral edge portion of the interlabial pad 44, and<br>
contacting surfaces other than the peripheral edge portion are not bonded.<br>
Therefore, a void portion 48 forms between the garment face side of the<br>
absorbing sheet body 46 and the body face side of the support sheet 42 to<br>
receive the menstrual blood therethrough.<br>
In the embodiment described hereinbefore, for example, as shown in Fig.<br>
5, the interlabial pad 44 is folded along the substantial center line (that is a<br>
dividing line of the absorber) and inserted into the labia, each absorbing sheet<br>
body 46 adheres to the inner wall of the labia, while a pocket-like void portion 48<br>
is formed between the garment face side of the absorbing sheet body 46 and the<br>
body face side of the support sheet 42. Therefore, the discharged menstrual<br>
blood rapidly flows into the void 48 to be absorbed into the garment face side<br>
(contacting surface with the support sheet 42) of the absorbing sheet body 46<br>
and to be also absorbed into the body face side (the contacting surface with the<br>
inner wall of the labia) of the absorbing sheet 46. Therefore, in comparison of the<br>
example that the absorbing sheet body 46 and the support sheet 42 are<br>
completely connected with each other at the contacting surface, an increased<br>
surface area of the absorber 43 improves absorption efficiency and the<br>
menstrual blood can be rapidly transferred into the absorber 43.<br>
Further the absorbing sheet portion 44a comprises a pair of absorbing<br>
sheet bodies 46, and is divided along the substantial center line of the pad 44,<br>
thereby in comparison with a pad comprised of the absorbing sheet body 46<br>
integrally, the pad of the present invention is easily folded to improve the<br>
property of following shapes, and the shape fitness in labia is improved.<br>
(2) The interlabial pad according to (1), wherein a side end of the<br>
interlabial pad has a shape of an arc, and both peripheral ends of the arc<br>
converge toward edge ends of the substantial center line along a longitudinal<br>
direction of the interlabial pad.<br>
An overall configuration of the interlabial pad of the present invention is<br>
not limited as long as the configuration is suitable to attach the pad to labia. For<br>
example, an elliptic shape, an ovoid shape, a gourd shape or a drop shape and<br>
the like will be eligible. However, in consideration of the shape fitness with labia,<br>
for example, as illustrated in Fig. 6, it prefers that the side end 50 of the pad 44<br>
has an arc shape and both peripheral ends of the arc shape converge toward the<br>
peripheral end 52 of the substantial center line in a longitudinal direction of the<br>
pad 44.<br>
(3) The interlabial pad according to (1) or (2), wherein said pair of<br>
absorbing sheet bodies are separated each other, and a groove portion is<br>
provided between the absorbing sheet bodies.<br>
In the interlabial pad of the present invention, it is not limited to the<br>
embodiment that a pair of absorbing sheet bodies are arranged in neighbor each<br>
other, and may provide a groove portion between a pair of absorbing sheet<br>
bodies. For example, as illustrated in Fig. 7, the groove portion 54 can be<br>
provided between absorbing sheet bodies 46 such that a pair of absorbing sheet<br>
bodies 46 are separated from each other with an interval of 10mm.<br>
In a normal interlabial pad, once the menstrual blood transmits the cover<br>
sheet once, a part of the menstrual blood solidifies and remains in the cover<br>
sheet. Even though the absorber still has an absorption capacity of the<br>
menstrual blood, it has tendency not to absorb the menstrual blood any more. In<br>
case of providing the groove portion 54 as described hereinbefore, the<br>
menstrual biood moves rapidly along the groove portion 54 in forward and<br>
backward directions. Therefore, the absorber 43 contained in the absorbing<br>
sheet body 46 can be used effectively and can demonstrate its absorption<br>
capacity.<br>
(4) The interlabial pad according to any one of (1) to (3), wherein on a<br>
body face side of the support sheet, an strip-shaped absorber is disposed along<br>
a dividing line of a pair of absorbing sheet bodies.<br>
The interlabial pad of the present invention may be structured, for<br>
example, as shown in Fig. 8, such that the strip-shaped absorber 58 is provided<br>
on the body face side of the support sheet 42 along the dividing line of a pair of<br>
absorbing sheet bodies 46 (along the substantial center line of the longitudinal<br>
direction of the interlabial pad 44).<br>
As illustrated in Fig. 9, the interlabial pad 44 is folded along the dividing<br>
line of a pair of absorbing sheet body 46 and a strip-shaped absorber 56<br>
appears, and the pad is inserted into the iabia under the conditions, the<br>
strip-shaped absorber 58 contacts closely with the depth portion of Iabia and a<br>
pair of absorbing sheet bodies 46 contact with the inner wall of iabia closely.<br>
Therefore, almost all of menstrual blood discharged from ostium vaginae is<br>
absorbed primarily by the strip-shaped absorber 56 which contacts closely with<br>
the depth portion of Iabia including neighborhood of ostium vaginae, even if a lot<br>
of the menstrual blood flow out at once, the menstrual blood is absorbed<br>
secondarily by a pair of absorbing sheet bodies 46 which contacts with the inner<br>
wall of Iabia. As described hereinbefore, a lot of menstrual blood, which flows<br>
down at once along the Iabia inner wall, can be transferred rapidly to the<br>
absorber 43 by a combination of the strip-shaped absorber 56 and a pair of<br>
absorbing sheet bodies 46.<br>
(5) The interlabia! pad according to any one of (1) to (4), further including<br>
a sheet-shaped absorber being disposed on a body face side of the support<br>
sheet, wherein a void is formed between the garment face side of the absorbing<br>
sheet body and the body face side of the sheet-shaped absorber whereby body<br>
fluid can flow into said void.<br>
In the interlabial pad of the present invention, for example, as shown in<br>
Fig.10, it prefers to dispose the sheet-shaped absorber 60 between the garment<br>
face side of the absorbing sheet bodies (more concretely the garment face side<br>
of the cover sheet 41) and the body face side of the support sheet 42. The<br>
structure described hereinbefore allows the menstrual blood to flow into the void<br>
portion 48 between the garment face side of the absorbing sheet bodies 46 and<br>
the body face side of the sheet-shaped absorber 60, and the flown blood is<br>
absorbed by not only the absorber 43 contained in the absorbing sheet body 46<br>
but also by the sheet shaped absorber 60. Therefore, the menstrual blood can<br>
be rapidly transferred into the absorber43 and a lot of menstrual blood at high<br>
rate can be absorbed by the pad.<br>
In this embodiment, it is more preferable that the fiber contained in the<br>
sheet-shaped absorber 60 is oriented in a lateral direction of the interlabial pad<br>
44, since the absorbed menstrual blood can easily transfer to the oriented<br>
direction of the fiber, that is, in left and right sides of the body, and the absorber<br>
can be used effectively.<br>
(6) The interlabial pad according to any one of (1) to (5), further<br>
comprising a mini sheet piece in the garment face side of the support sheet,<br>
including: one or more bonding portions on each side portion in respect of a<br>
longitudinal direction of the support sheet; and one or more disconnecting<br>
portion in a lateral direction of the support sheet, wherein at least one of<br>
said one or more disconnecting portion form an opening for receiving a finger<br>
between the mini sheet piece and the support sheet so as to directly keep the<br>
opening having a finger breadth in a surface direction of the support sheet.<br>
In the interlabial pad of the present invention, for example, as illustrated in<br>
Figs. 11 or 12, a mini sheet piece 62 is disposed to form an opening 64 for<br>
receiving a finger. In Figs. 11 and 12, in a lateral direction of the support sheet<br>
42, at least one of both sleeve portions of the mini sheet piece 62 is not bonded<br>
with the surface of the support sheet 42. Thereby the opening is formed<br>
between one sleeve side of the mini sheet piece 52, which is in a non-bonding<br>
condition, and the support sheet 42 to form the opening 64 for inserting a finger<br>
which is capable of inserting the finger.<br>
In a longitudinal direction of the support sheet 42, the mini sheet piece 62<br>
is bonded with only both lateral sides of the support sheet 42 and is not bonded<br>
(adhered) with the inside thereof. Therefore, the mini sheet piece 62 is<br>
provided from one lateral side of the support sheet 42 to the other lateral side<br>
thereof to bridge both of lateral sides; therefore, at the portion where the bridge<br>
is formed from one lateral side to the other, penetrating or non-penetrating space<br>
(space for inserting the finger) is formed. A finger can insert such space and hold<br>
the pad.<br>
The word "finger breadth" in this specification does not mean the<br>
thickness of the finger but the width of the finger in the spread direction of the<br>
nail concretely. The opening of the finger breadth means an opening having a<br>
sufficient size to insert the finger.<br>
Further, the opening of the finger breadth is "directly kept" in a direction of<br>
the support sheet surface. This means that when the finger is inserted into the<br>
pad naturally wear the pad, (the ball of a finger is directed to the garment face<br>
side of the support sheet and is inserted to maintain the condition), the pad of<br>
itself is formed primarily to be adequate for inserting the finger. Therefore, the<br>
following case is excluded from the aforementioned example, such that the<br>
opening for the finger breadth is kept in a surface direction by rotating the finger<br>
after the person inserts the finger, and the opening for the finger breadth is<br>
formed on the support sheet surface side secondarily.<br>
As described hereinbefore, in the pad provided with the mini sheet piece,<br>
the finger is inserted into the finger insertion opening, thereby the pad can be<br>
kept and fixed at the finger temporarily. In this case, the opening for inserting a<br>
finger is formed to be the opening for the finger breadth of a wearer, and the<br>
flat-shaped finger tip is prevented from directing to different directions in respect<br>
of the support sheet, and is inserted to contact with the support sheet surface<br>
naturally. That is, the opening for inserting the finger has a wide shape in<br>
directions of the support sheet surface in accordance with the shape of the finger<br>
tip of the person to wear, and therefore, the wearer is intended to act that the<br>
direction where the finger is inserted is determined to detect a fix point of the pad<br>
by the ball of the finger tip. Thereby, in attaching the pad between labia where<br>
the wearer is difficult to confirm by eyes, the pad can be attached at the<br>
adequate position by correctly holding a correct attachment point.<br>
Incidentally, in the present invention, not only the peripheral edge portion<br>
of the pad but also the neighborhood to the peripheral edge portion to where the<br>
mini sheet piece can be bonded are included in the "side portion" in the<br>
longitudinal direction of the support sheet.<br>
(7) The interlabial pad according to (6), wherein at least a pair of<br>
absorbing sheet bodies include: an inclining portion having a mountain shape in<br>
a body side direction, the mountain shape having a vertex in the substantial<br>
center line along the longitudinal direction of the interlabial pad and a pair of side<br>
side of the support sheet and is inserted to maintain the condition), the pad of<br>
itself is formed primarily to be adequate for inserting the finger. Therefore, the<br>
following case is excluded from the aforementioned example, such that the<br>
opening for the finger breadth is kept in a surface direction by rotating the finger<br>
after the person inserts the finger, and the opening for the finger breadth is<br>
formed on the support sheet surface side secondarily.<br>
As described hereinbefore, in the pad provided with the mini sheet piece,<br>
the finger is inserted into the finger insertion opening, thereby the pad can be<br>
kept and fixed at the finger temporarily. In this case, the opening for inserting a<br>
finger is formed to be the opening for the finger breadth of a wearer, and the<br>
flat-shaped finger tip is prevented from directing to different directions in respect<br>
of the support sheet, and is inserted to contact with the support sheet surface<br>
naturally. That is, the opening for inserting the finger has a wide shape in<br>
directions of the support sheet surface in accordance with the shape of the finger<br>
tip of the person to wear, and therefore, the wearer is intended to act that the<br>
direction where the finger is inserted is determined to detect a fix point of the pad<br>
by the ball of the finger tip. Thereby, in attaching the pad between labia where<br>
the wearer is difficult to confirm by eyes, the pad can be attached at the<br>
adequate position by correctly holding a correct attachment point.<br>
Incidentally, in the present invention, not only the peripheral edge portion<br>
of the pad but also the neighborhood to the peripheral edge portion to where the<br>
mini sheet piece can be bonded are included in the "side portion" in the<br>
longitudinal direction of the support sheet.<br>
(7) The interlabial pad according to (6), wherein at least a pair of<br>
absorbing sheet bodies include: an inclining portion having a mountain shape in<br>
a body side direction, the mountain shape having a vertex in the substantial<br>
center line along the longitudinal direction of the interlabial pad and a pair of side<br>
ends; and a hem portion continuing from both of the side ends of said inclining<br>
portion, wherein the mini sheet piece is bonded on the garment side of said hem<br>
portion.<br>
In the interlabial pad of the present invention, for example, as illustrated in<br>
Fig. 13, preferably a pair of the absorbing sheet bodies 46 (that is, the cover<br>
sheet 41 and the absorber 43) comprises an inclining portion 68 and a hem<br>
portion 70. The inclining portion 68 has a mountain shape toward the body side<br>
direction along the substantial center line 66 of the longitudinal direction of the<br>
interlabial pad 44. The hem portion 70 continues from both side ends of the<br>
inclining portion 68. The mini sheet piece 62 is bonded with the garment side of<br>
the hem portion 70.<br>
The aforementioned structure allows the absorbing sheet body 46 to<br>
easily progress into the depth of the iabia, and a whole shape of the interlabial<br>
pad 44 has a form easily capable of effecting a pinching force of Iabia. Therefore,<br>
the pad can provide the user a good adhesion and a wear feeling. Further the<br>
finger is inserted into the finger insertion opening 64 to belong the ball of the<br>
finger with the central fold line of the inclining portion 68, and the interlabial pad<br>
44 is maintained, thereby the interiabial pad 44 can be guided correctly toward<br>
the Iabia which is difficult to confirm by eyes and can be easily attached thereto.<br>
Incidentally, in this embodiment, it is sufficient to comprise at least the<br>
absorbing sheet portion (that is, the cover sheet 41 and the absorber 43) in a<br>
mountain shape. As illustrated in Fig. 13, the embodiment, which the support<br>
sheet 42 has a mountain shape, is of course included in a scope of present the<br>
invention.<br>
(8) The interlabial pad according to any one of (1) to (7), wherein the<br>
interlabial pad is used together with a sanitary napkin.<br>
There have been users to use a plurality of sanitary napkins (as referred a<br>
"napkin" in following description) laminated with each other when a large volume<br>
of menstrual blood flows. However, there has been a problem of bad wear<br>
feeling such as stiffness, and it is noticeable from the outside of the garment to<br>
the presence of the pad. Further, laminated napkins cover portions other than<br>
the neighborhood of ostium vaginae where the laminated use is unnecessary,<br>
thereby causing a rash or a sweat. However, when the pad and the napkin are<br>
used together, the sanitary products are laminated only around the ostium<br>
vaginae, thereby the aforementioned problem can be solved. Further only the<br>
pad can be changed without changing the napkin, thereby the wearer does not<br>
have to carry a napkin, which has a relatively large size. The sanitary napkin<br>
may include not only the napkin in the market for absorbing the menstrual blood<br>
but also the sheet for absorbing the vaginal discharge.<br>
(9) The interlabial pad according to any one of (1) to (8), wherein the<br>
interlabial pad is a pad for incontinence of urine.<br>
According to the interlabial pad of the present invention, the pad can be<br>
used for a pad for absorbing incontinence of urine. That is, ostium vaginae<br>
where the menstrual blood is discharged and the urethral meatus, where urine is<br>
discharged locate between labia, and the interlabial pad of the present invention<br>
to be used between labia can absorb urine also.<br>
As described hereinbefore, the pad of the present invention can absorb<br>
urine between labia, especially around the urethral opening and is useful for the<br>
absorbing pad for incontinence of urine, especially for a light incontinence of<br>
urine.<br>
(10) The interlabial pad according to any one of (1) to (8), wherein the<br>
interlabial pad is a pad for absorbing vaginal discharge.<br>
In accordance with the invention, the interlabial pad can be used for the<br>
pad of absorbing the vaginal discharge. That is, the interlabial pad is used<br>
between labia and can absorb the excretion (vaginal discharge) other than the<br>
menstrual blood from ostium vaginae. Therefore, the interlabial pad may be<br>
used for the application (for absorbing the vaginal discharge).<br>
As described above, the pad can absorb the vaginal discharge in order<br>
to decrease the discomfort for the wearer, and is useful for the wearer who is not<br>
menstruating.<br>
(11) The wrapping body comprising: the interlabial pad according to (1) to<br>
(10); and a wrapping container for wrapping the interlabial pad individually.<br>
When the interlabial pad is packaged individually, the pad can be carried<br>
one by one (each individual packages). As compared with a plurality of pads<br>
contained in one package, the pad is kept sanitarily, can be easily carried and<br>
can be treated simply.<br>
(12). The wrapping body comprising: the interlabial pad according to any<br>
one of (6) to (10); and a wrapping container for wrapping the interlabial pad<br>
individually, said wrapping container having an unwrapped opening, wherein<br>
said interlabial pad is so contained in said wrapping container that said finger<br>
insertion opening faces and opens toward the unwrapped opening of the<br>
wrapping container.<br>
As illustrated in Fig. 14, "said finger insertion opening faces and opens<br>
toward the unwrapped opening" illustrates that, upon the wrapping body 72<br>
being opened, the mini sheet piece 62 and further the finger insertion opening 64,<br>
which is formed by the piece, appear and, immediately, the finger can be<br>
inserted into the finger insertion opening 64. For example, as illustrated in Figs.<br>
14 and Fig. 15, the wrapping body 72 can be opened by pulling a tub tape 74,<br>
which is provided at the upper surface side of the wrapping container 76, toward<br>
the right side of the drawing. Finger insertion opening 64 appears at the<br>
opening of the wrapping body to open toward the unwrapped opening.<br>
Therefore the user can insert the finger immediately into the finger insertion<br>
opening 64.<br>
(13) The wrapping body according to (12), wherein the interlabial pad is<br>
contained in the wrapping container such that the mini sheet piece is<br>
mountain-folded toward garment side directions along the substantial center line<br>
in the longitudinal direction of the interlabial pad.<br>
"To be mountain-folded toward garment side directions," means that the<br>
sheet is completely folded in forming the garment side to be a convex, and<br>
further includes the case that, as illustrated in Fig. 16, the sheet is inflected in<br>
forming the garment side to be a convex. As described hereinbefore, the<br>
interlabial pad 44 is contained in the wrapping container 76, thereby the folded<br>
finger insertion opening 64 is naturally opened at the time of breaking the seal.<br>
Therefore, the wearer can confirm easily the part where she inserts her finger so<br>
as to achieve more smooth and simple attachment of the pad.<br>
In this embodiment, the mini sheet piece may be a mountain-folded shape<br>
and it is not required that a whole pad is in a mountain-folded shape. Therefore,<br>
for example, as illustrated in Fig. 16, in the wrapping body 72, a whole interlabial<br>
pad 44 is folded in a mountain-folded shape and contained in the wrapping<br>
container 76. Further as illustrated in Fig. 17, in the wrapping body 72, only the<br>
mini sheet piece 62 is folded in the mountain-folded shape, while the main body<br>
of the interlabial pad 44 is folded in a V-shaped toward the garment side and<br>
contained in the wrapping container 76.<br>
Further, the method of breaking the seal of the wrapping container is not<br>
limited specifically. As illustrated in Figs. 16 and Fig. 17, the wrapping container<br>
76 of which an upper end side is cut to break it is eligible. Further as illustrated in<br>
Fig. 18, a wrapping container 76 which is broken the seal from the upper end to<br>
both sides (what is called a set of folding doors) is eligible.<br>

Best Mode of Carrying Out the Invention<br>
Preferable embodiments of the interlabial pad in accordance with the<br>
present invention will be described with reference to accompanied drawings.<br>
Incidentally, in the specification of the present invention, the word "bulkiness"<br>
means a size of the direction which the absorbing sheet body projects, "the<br>
width" means a size of the lateral direction of the pad and "the length" means a<br>
size of the longitudinal direction of the pad.<br>
Figs. 1(a) and 1(b) are views of an interlabial pad 14 according to the<br>
invention that Fig. 1(a) shows a top view of the pad and that Fig. 1(b) shows a<br>
cross section view along line A-A' of Fig. 1(a).<br>
[(A) Structure of Basic Interlabial pad]<br>
As shown in Figs. 1(a) and 1{b), the basic interlabial pad 14 of the present<br>
invention comprises an absorbing sheet portion 14a and a support sheet portion<br>
14b to back the absorbing sheet portion 14a. The absorbing sheet portion 14a<br>
includes an absorber 13 at least for absorbing the menstrual blood, the surface<br>
thereof is covered by a water permeable cover sheet 11 if desired and is used to<br>
face toward the body side in wearing it. And the absorbing sheet 14a is<br>
structured by a pair of absorbing sheet bodies 16, which are separated along the<br>
substantial centerline of the pad 14. While the support sheet 14b is structured<br>
by an impermeable support sheet 12.<br>
The absorbing sheet body 16 and the support sheet 12 are connected<br>
with each other on the peripheral edge portion 15 of the interlabial pad 14 and<br>
the contact surface other than that is in a condition of being not connected so<br>
that a void 18 is formed between the garment face side of the absorbing sheet<br>
16 and the body face side of the support sheet 12, through which the menstrual<br>
blood can flow into.<br>
The whole formation of the interlabial pad 14 is eligible for attaching to the<br>
labia and is not limited to the specific one, however it is preferable to form it into<br>
a substantial oblong shape, for example, to an elliptic type, an ovoid type, a<br>
gourd-shape, a drop-shape and the like. It is preferable to decide the size of the<br>
interlabial pad 14 in consideration of easily attaching to the labia. In view of<br>
them, preferably the length of the pad is 60 to 150 mm, more preferably 80 to<br>
120 mm. Further it is preferable that the length in the lateral direction of the<br>
interlabial pad is a range of 10 to 60mm in appearance, more preferably of 20 to<br>
40mm. In case that the length in the lateral direction is longer than 60mm, the<br>
area exceeding from the labia scrapes with the femoral region and the like of the<br>
person, and resultantiy the friction which is caused by scrapping, will overcome<br>
the inching force of both labia and there is a fear of dropping off the interlabial<br>
pad. Further, in case of the length in the lateral direction of the pad being<br>
shorter than 10mm, the area of the pad in capable of interposing between labia<br>
is decreased. Therefore the contact area with labia surface is also decreased<br>
and it is easily caused a fear of dropping off the interlabial pad from labia.<br>
Incidentally, the word "in appearance" means that the length is the minimum<br>
distance between tow points (corresponding to V in Fig. 29). Since in the<br>
production process, there is a case that the distance tracing the uneven form,<br>
that is, the distance between two points in a flat condition of the pad which the<br>
uneven shape is provided is treated as a substantial distance (corresponding to<br>
W in Fig. 29), the distance is defined very carefully. In case of wrapping the<br>
absorber 13 in the cover sheet 11 r to prevent the bad wear feeling caused by the<br>
peripheral edge of the absorber becoming hard, preferably the size of the<br>
absorber 13 wrapped by the cover sheet 11 is structured to be 2 to 10mm<br>
smaller than the outline of the cover sheet 11.<br>
In the interlabial pad 14 illustrated in Fig. 1, the absorbing sheet body 16<br>
which absorber 13 is wrapped by the cover sheet 11 is adhered on the support<br>
sheet 12 by an adhesive.<br>
For the adhesive used for the pad, a pressure sensitive adhesive made up<br>
mainly of a synthetic rubber such as non water soluble styrene<br>
-ethylene-butadiene-styrene block copolymer (SEBS),<br>
styrene-butadiene-styrene block copolymer (SBS), styrene-isoprene-styrene<br>
block copolymer (SIS) and the like, the heat sensitive adhesive made up mainly<br>
of a heat flexible resin such as ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer (EVA) and the<br>
like, the adhesive made up mainly of water soluble heat flexible resin (such as<br>
poly vinyl alcohol (PVA)), water sensitive gel made up mainly of a starch glue, or<br>
acrylic acid and comprised of the chemical simulation, the felxibilizer or a water<br>
included therein, non water sensitive gel made up mainly of a silicone and<br>
comprised of the chemical stimulation and the flexibiiizer included therein , are<br>
eligible. It may select to dispose the adhesive from a surface type, a dot type, a<br>
mesh type, a stripe type and the like.<br>
[Cover sheet]<br>
For the cover sheet, the sheet-shaped material having a liquid<br>
permeable structure of a woven or non woven fabric are eligible and is not<br>
limited to the specific one. For the woven or non woven fabric material, both<br>
natural fabric and chemical fabric can be used. For example of the natural<br>
fabric, cellulose such as a grinding pulp and cotton is eligible. For example of<br>
the chemical fabric, a regenerated cellulose such as a viscose rayon and a fibril<br>
rayon, semi synthetic cellulose such as acetate and triacetate, a heat flexible<br>
hydrophobic chemical fiber which is treated in hydrophilic are eligible. For a<br>
heat flexible hydrophobic chemical fiber, a single fiber such as polyethylene (PE),<br>
polypropylene (PP), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), a fiber comprised of a<br>
graft polymerization of PE and PP, or a compound fiber of which core material is<br>
PP or PET and a myelin part is PE are eligible.<br>
Furthermore, especially in case of using the non woven fabric, a web<br>
forming may be manufactured by a single dry method (a card method, a spun<br>
bond method, a melt blown method, a air laid method, a through air method, a<br>
point bond method and the like) or a single wet method and the like, or by a<br>
combination of plurality methods thereof. For a method of bonding, a thermal<br>
bonding, a needle punch, a chemical bonding and the like are eligible, however it<br>
is not limited to the specific methods. Further a spun lace that is formed in a<br>
sheet type by a water flow confounding may be eligible.<br>
Among the materials, considering the liquid mobility from the inner face of<br>
the labia, chemical stimulation by an activator, and adhesion with the inner wall<br>
of the labia, it is preferable to laminate rayon with 1.1 to 4.4dtex fineness and 7<br>
to 51 mm fiber length by 40 to 80 % of a total specific weight per unit area on the<br>
body face side, and to laminate a mixture of rayon with 1.1 to 4.4dtex fineness<br>
and 7 to 51 mm fiber length by 14 to 42 % of a total specific weight per unit area<br>
and PET with 1.1 to 4.4dtex fineness and 7 to 51 mm fiber length by 6 to 18 % of<br>
a total specific weight per unit area on the garment face side. After laminating<br>
them so that the total specific weight per unit area of the two layers becomes 20<br>
to 60 g/m2, the fibers are entangled by water - flow interlacing treatment and<br>
then dried to prepare spun lace non woven fabric with the thickness of 0.13 to<br>
0.50 mm. The spun lace non woven prepared as described is preferable. At<br>
this time, by mixing PET on the garment face side, bulkiness can be easily<br>
maintained even if the water permeable sheet becomes wet. Therefore,<br>
adhesion to the inner wall of the labia can be maintained.<br>
Furthermore, since for transferring the menstrual blood into the absorber,<br>
the capillarity and the water permeability is required on a part of contacting area<br>
with ostium vaginae of the cover sheet, it prefers to use a porous non woven<br>
fabric sheet having a rate of hole area from 5 to 60% and a hole area of 0.28 to<br>
4.9mm2. While in addition to the capillarity to transfer the menstrual blood into<br>
the absorber, the improved contact ability with the labia inner wall is required to<br>
the part comprising the area contacting with the labia inner wall, and it prefers to<br>
use the non woven fabric sheet, which has the surface without the unevenness<br>
and is not provided with the porous.<br>
[Absorber]<br>
The absorber may be capable of keeping and absorbing a liquid (the<br>
menstrual blood) and preferably may be bulky, may not be difficult to lose the<br>
shape and may have less chemical stimulation. For the material of the<br>
absorber, cellulose (natural pulp, chemical pulp or natural cotton and the like), a<br>
regenerated cellulose (a rayon and a fibril rayon and the like), a semi synthetic<br>
cellulose (acetate and triacetate and the like), a particle water-absorbing resin, a<br>
fiber-type water-absorbing resin, a chemical fiber (a heat flexible hydrophobic<br>
chemical fiber which is treated in hydrophilic and the like) and a hydrophobic<br>
resin can be used in single or can be mixed.<br>
The method of forming these materials to the absorber is not limited to the<br>
specific one, however, for example, the materials is manufactured into the sheet<br>
type by an air laid method, a melt blown method, a spun lace method and a<br>
paper making and the like. Concretely, the air laid pulp (or water-absorbing resin<br>
is mixed therewith), the melt blown non woven fabric treated into hydrophobic,<br>
the spun lace non woven fabric mainly comprised of hydrophobic fiber, tissue,<br>
cellulose foam, a continuous foam of the synthetic resin and the like can be used.<br>
Furthermore it is possible to grind these sheet-shaped materials and thereafter<br>
to form them into the absorber again.<br>
It is preferable for the absorber, although any material can be used as<br>
long as it is capable of absorbing and holding liquid (body fluid), to be bulky, hard<br>
- to - be deformed, less chemically stimulant, and highly flexible to fit into the<br>
labia. Specifically, a non woven sheet in which, 50 to 150 g/m2 of pulp selected<br>
from the range of the fiber length of 1 to 10 mm is laminated on the garment face<br>
side and, on the body face side, 150 to 250 g/m2 of a mixture obtained by mixing<br>
60 to 90 % of rayon with 1.1 to 4.4dtex fineness and 20 to 51 mm fiber length<br>
with 40 to 10 % of natural cotton by this mixing ratio is laminated, which then to<br>
be formed into a sheet by dotted embossing to have 2 to 10 mm bulkiness, and<br>
more preferable to have 3 to 5 mm bulkiness. Thereby, liquid can be easily<br>
transferred from the body face side to the garment face side resulting in the<br>
improvement of the absorbing and holding capacity. Furthermore, by providing<br>
a mesh spun lace non woven fabric of rayon with 1.1 to 4.4dtex fineness and 25<br>
to 51 mm fiber length by a specific weight per unit area of 15 to 40 g/m2, the<br>
liquid transferred from the body face side can be diffused by the mesh spun lace<br>
to be induced to almost all over the region of the pulp layer. Therefore, more<br>
liquid can be effectively absorbed.<br>
[Support Sheet]<br>
In case of using the water permeability material, the same material, which<br>
is used for the cover sheet, is eligible. In this case, it prefers to use the pad<br>
together with a sanitary napkin (a pad used together with the sanitary napkin).<br>
Further if impermeable material is used to the support sheet, the<br>
menstrual blood, which is kept in the absorber, is prevented from a leak out of<br>
the interlabial pad. Furthermore the pad can be comprised of water vapor<br>
permeability material, thereby in wearing the pad, the sweat and the discomfort<br>
can be decreased.<br>
To apply impermeable materials, an impermeable film such as a thin<br>
filmed synthetic resin of PE, PP and the like, a porous film comprised that a<br>
synthetic resin is filled with inorganic filler and provided with an extension<br>
treatment, a laminate film compound of a paper or non woven fabric and<br>
impermeable film, water repellent, a porous resin film is connected on a rear<br>
surface of the non woven fabric of a spun bond or a spun lace which are treated<br>
with a water repellent, are eligible. Further for a method of providing ventilation<br>
on impermeable sheet, it is eligible to form a capillary having 10 to 30% rate of<br>
the hole area and a pore size of 0.1 to 0.6 mm toward the absorber.<br>
More concrete example of applying impermeable materials, a film mainly<br>
of a low density polyethylene (LDPE) resin is eligible which is obtained from a<br>
range of a density 0.900 to 0.925g/cm3, in amount from 15 to 30g/m2 by a<br>
specific weight per unit, based on the specific weight per unit area of the<br>
composition. The flexibility not to hurt a wear feeling is considered.<br>
Furthermore the flexibility not to hurt a fixing feeling is considered, for<br>
example, it prefers to use a film mainly of a low density polyethylene (LDPE)<br>
which is obtained from a range of a density 0.900 to 0.925g/cm3, in amount from<br>
15 to 30g/m2 by a specific weight per unit, based on the specific weight per unit<br>
area of the composition.<br>
More preferably, during the pad is attached between labia, impermeable<br>
sheets are contacted with each other, with the pad which is used together or with<br>
the under wear, to decrease a fear of dropping the interlabial pad from the labia<br>
due to the high friction, the film is treated an embossing process and the convex<br>
upheaval portion is disposed, thereby it may decrease a ratio contact by less<br>
friction drag.<br>
[Mini Sheet Piece]<br>
A material used for the mini sheet piece is selected in consideration of<br>
having an enough strength against a damage by the inserted finger, preferably it<br>
can be selected individually from or from one laminated a sheet-shaped non<br>
woven fabric, an elastic and expand non woven fabric, a film, a foam film, an<br>
elastic and expand film, a foam sheet, a tissue paper and the like.<br>
Preferably the breaking strength in the lateral direction of the mini sheet<br>
piece, which is structured by materials described hereinbefore, is 0.1N/10mm,<br>
more preferably from 0.1 to 1.0 N/10mm. This breaking strength is a value per<br>
a width of 10mm, which is evaluated by a tensilon testing that the mini sheet<br>
piece is held with a chuck distance of 100mm and pulled by a velocity of<br>
100mm/min.<br>
In consideration of the above-described condition, concretely the film<br>
which has a thickness from 15 to 30um and is mainly composed of LDPE resin<br>
having a density of 0.920g/cm3, is eligible. While for easily putting the finger in<br>
and out of the finger insertion opening of the mini sheet piece, it is preferably to<br>
select the foam film which is mainly composed of LDPE resin having a density<br>
from 0.915g/cm3 and on which a capillary which has a bulkiness from 0.3 to<br>
1.0mm and a pore size from 0.3 to 1.5mm, is formed at the rate of hole area from<br>
15 to 60%.<br>
It is possible to use the material having an extensibility or an elastically<br>
expand to the lateral direction of the support sheet for inserting the finger into the<br>
mini sheet piece regardless of the finger size of the user.<br>
For providing the extensibility to the mini sheet piece, an extensible spun<br>
bond non woven fabric may be used. The fabric has a stress from 0.1 to<br>
0.5N/25mm in 5 % extension in case of a constant speed extension by a speed<br>
of testing of 100mm/min with a knob distance of 100mm. Further providing an<br>
elasticity and an expand for the mini sheet piece, it may be used a fiber-shaped<br>
sheet and a film sheet which a heat flexible elastomer resin is used and may be<br>
used independently an elastic and expand materials such as these heat flexible<br>
resin or a natural rubber and the like, or may be used a combination of inelastic<br>
and expand materials. Further it is a preferable embodiment to provide elasticity<br>
for a film mainly formed from LDPE resin by a corrugate treatment.<br>
The length of the mini sheet piece is determined to hold the interlabial pad<br>
certainly and to easily put the finger into the opening. Concretely the length of<br>
the mini sheet piece prefers at least 10 % over than the length of the interlabial<br>
pad, more preferably within a range from 10 to 80%, and most preferably within<br>
a range from 30 to 60%. The width of the opening through for inserting the finger<br>
prefers at least 20mm or more, more preferably within a range from 20 to 50mm,<br>
and most preferably within a range from 30 to 40mm.<br>
With respect to the form of the mini sheet piece, for example, as shown in<br>
Fig. 19, it is eligible to form that along the garment face side of the support sheet<br>
42 comprising the interlabial pad 44, the strip-shaped mini sheet piece 52 is<br>
horizontally disposed in the lateral direction of the interlabial pad 44. In this<br>
example, the mini sheet piece 62 is fixed at both side ends of the interlabial pad<br>
44 and the finger insertion opening 64, that is the opening for inserting the finger,<br>
is formed toward the longitudinal direction of the interlabial pad 44.<br>
In the embodiment, when the finger 78 is inserted into the finger insertion<br>
opening 64 with contacting a ball of a finger 78 to the support sheet 42, as<br>
illustrated in Fig. 20, the longitudinal direction of the interlabial pad 44 and a<br>
direction of pudendal slit 80, face in the same direction. Therefore the interlabial<br>
pad 44 can be push into the inside of the labia by a ball of the finger 78 so as to<br>
attach the interlabial pad 44 certainly.<br>
Further the mini sheet piece may be formed as illustrated in Fig. 21, for<br>
example, that the support sheet 42 which comprises the interlabial pad 44, is<br>
completely covered from the near central portion in the longitudinal direction to<br>
an edge end 82 in the longitudinal direction of the interlabial pad 44. The<br>
embodiment described hereinbefore is preferable for a sanitary handling of the<br>
pad so that the finger end 78 is prevented from exposing out of the mini sheet<br>
piece 62 and non-bonding condition of the menstrual blood and the finger 78 can<br>
be maintained.<br>
Incidentally, for example, as illustrated in Fig. 22, the end of the finger 78<br>
is also prevented from exposing out of the mini sheet piece 62 by the interlabial<br>
pad 44 which a plurality of strip-shaped mini sheet pieces 62 are formed at<br>
distance, thereby the effect of the sanitary handling can be achieved as same as<br>
the interlabial pad 44 as shown in Fig. 20.<br>
Fig. 23 is a top view of the interlabial pad 44, and Fig. 24 is a section view<br>
along line A-A' of the interlabial pad of Fig, 23. In case of providing the mini sheet<br>
piece, for example, as illustrated in Fig. 24, it prefers to form the void 83 to insert<br>
the finger preliminarily by somewhat rising the mini sheet piece 62 from garment<br>
face side of the support sheet 42.<br>
In this embodiment, the width of the mini sheet piece 62 is formed<br>
somewhat larger than that of the interlabial pad 44 and the piece 62 is bonded<br>
with the periphery edge portion 45 of the interlabial pad 44 in somewhat loose<br>
condition not to contact with the garment face side of the support sheet 42. The<br>
method of fixing the pad is not limited specifically, for example, the method of<br>
pressure sensitive hot melt adhesive, heat sensitive hot melt adhesive, heat seal,<br>
ultra sonic seal and the like will be eligible. The application of the adhesive can<br>
be selected from, for example, a surface-shaped, a line-shaped, a spiral-shaped,<br>
a dot-shaped and the like.<br>
In the interlabial pad 44, as illustrated in Fig. 24, the side end of the mini<br>
sheet piece 62 is bonded with the periphery edge portion 45. In this<br>
embodiment, to prevent the periphery edge portion 45 from the stiff wear feeling<br>
of the interlabiai pad 44, preferably the width of bonding portion is set in a range<br>
from 2 to 5 mm. Further the mini sheet piece 62 is bonded inwardly (toward the<br>

area from 5 to 20% in consideration of the feeling of the laminate material.<br>
[Wrapping body]<br>
The wrapping body in accordance with the present invention wherein the<br>
interlabial pad is contained in a wrapping container includes, other than the<br>
aforementioned wrapping bodies, for example, the embodiment illustrated in<br>
Figs, 25 and 26. In the wrapping body 72, the interlabial pad 44 is folded so<br>
that the mini sheet piece 62 faces along the substantial center line of the<br>
longitudinal direction, the interlabial pad 44 is wrapped in one wrapping sheet<br>
subject to be a wrapping container 76 as illustrated and the peripheral end<br>
portion of the sheet is sealed. In the embodiment, two wrapping sheets may<br>
hold the interlabial pad 44 and the edge portion of the sheet is sealed.<br>
Incidentally, the mini sheet piece 62 is folded in facing along the centerline,<br>
thereby the user can confirm the mini sheet piece 62 by eyes in opening the<br>
wrapping container 72.<br>
In the wrapping container 76 illustrated in Fig. 25, 26, the portion 84 is<br>
sealed with a condition in capable of breaking and more preferably for easily<br>
opening and for preventing the pad from a damage in using, that the portion is<br>
sealed by a heat seal with the breaking strength in a range from 0.3 to<br>
1.0N/25mm, which is evaluated testing with a velocity of 100mm/min by a<br>
tensilon testing. In the wrapping container illustrated in Fig. 25 and Fig. 26, the<br>
knob 86 is provided and the wrapping container 76 can be broken by picking two<br>
knobs 86.<br>
In comprising the wrapping container by sealing the wrapping sheet, other<br>

breaking the portion 84, as illustrated in Fig. 27 and Fig. 28, it may be possible to<br>
structure that the container is opened by breaking the perforation 88 to be<br>
formed on the inner peripheral side of the portion 84. In the wrapping body 72<br>
illustrated in Fig. 27, the interlabial pad is folded simultaneously with the<br>
wrapping sheet so as to face rear surface sides with each other, thereafter three<br>
edge portions of the wrapping body are sealed by a heat seal and the perforation<br>
is formed on the inner peripheral side. In the wrapping body 72 illustrated in Fig.<br>
28, the pad is folded in a manner that the rear surface sides face with each other,<br>
thereafter is wrapped by two wrapping sheets, four edge portions are sealed by<br>
the heat seal and the perforation is formed on the inner peripheral side.<br>
In consideration of preventing the pad from damage in keeping it and of<br>
easily breaking the wrapping in using, the breaking strength of the perforation 88<br>
is preferably in a range from 0.2 to 3.0N/25mm, further from 0.3 to1.5N/25mm.<br>
Further for easily breaking the perforation, it is required to start the perforation 88<br>
from the end of the wrapping container 76 as illustrated, while the perforation 88<br>
may be formed continuously or intermittently if it can be broken. Furthermore in<br>
case of forming the perforation 88, it is also preferable that the strength on the<br>
portion 84 is increased, since it is prevented from misunderstanding to break and<br>
open such as the bonding portion 84 of the wrapping container 76 as illustrated<br>

For any embodiment illustrated in Fig. 27 and Fig. 28, it prefers that the<br>
user can easily confirm the start point of the perforation by printing an arrow<br>
confirmed by eyes, or by cutting around the start point of the perforation in a<br>
different formation from other portions or by forming whole wrapping body in<br>
unsymmetrical design.<br>
[(B) Structure of the interlabial pad provided with biodegradability, water<br>
dispersibility and water solubility]<br>
Preferably the interlabial pad is comprised of a material of biodegradability<br>
and/or a material of water dispersibility and/or a material of water solubility.<br>
After using the pad comprised of these materials, it can be disposed into a toilet<br>
to flush, thereby the destruction of the pad can be easily and sanitarily achieved<br>
and the garbage in a toilet can be decreased.<br>
In this Specification, "biodegradability" means that a substance is<br>
decomposed into gas such as carbon dioxide or methane, water, and biomass<br>
under anaerobic or aerobic condition according to the natural process under the<br>
existence of bacteria represented by actinomycetes and other microbes, and<br>
also means that the biodegradability (biodegradable rate and biodegradable<br>
degree) of the substance equals to a material naturally generated such as fallen<br>
leaves or a synthetic polymer generally recognized having the same<br>
biodegradability under the same environment. The description "water<br>
dispersibility" has a same means of water solubility and that is not effected from<br>
restricted volume of fluid (menstrual blood), however in a volume of water or<br>
water flow, fiber themselves are easily dispersed into small piece to the extent<br>
not to damage the normal toilet pipe. "Water solubility" means a nature that is not<br>
affected by restricted volume of fluid (menstrual blood) in using, however is<br>
dissolved by a volume of water or water flow.<br>
[Cover Sheet]<br>
Any of natural fiber and chemical fiber can be used for materials of the<br>
cover sheet to achieve biodegradability, water dispersibility and water solubility.<br>
For example of natural fiber, there are cellulose such as a grinding pulp and<br>
cotton and air laid pulp and the like which is chemically composed by<br>
water-soluble resin. For examples of chemical fiber, there are regenerated<br>
cellulose such as rayon, fibril rayon, PE, PP, PET, materials which is hydrophilic<br>
treated to the chemical fiber such as ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer, moreover<br>
poly lactic acid so-called biodegradable fiber, and polybutylene succinate and<br>
the like. Further water-soluble carboxymethylcellulose and polyvinyl alcohol<br>
are eligible for use. In these materials, it prefers to use biodegradable fiber that<br>
are cellulose such as a pulp and cotton, regenerated cellulose such as rayon<br>
and the like and poly lactic acid.<br>
Incidentally, materials described hereinbefore can be used independently<br>
or be mixed by forming a web or the non-woven fabric. For web forming<br>
biodegradable fabric such as poly lactic acid or polybutylene succinate and the<br>
like, any of a card method, a spun bond method, a melt blown method or a dry<br>
method or a wet method by an air laid method, or a combination of these is<br>
eligible. For a method of bonding, a thermal bonding, a needle punch bonding,<br>
a chemical bonding and the like are eligible. However, it is not limited to these<br>
method. Further, a spun lace formed in a sheet-shaped by a water flow<br>
confounding is eligible.<br>
For an example of a forming method of applying water dispersibility, a<br>
method of producing a water soluble paper which the fiber is formed in the<br>
sheet-shaped by a hydrogen bonding of fiber themselves, a method of producing<br>
water soluble paper which fibers are bonded each other into sheet-shaped by<br>
water soluble binder or a method of producing water soluble paper which fibers<br>
are confounded into sheet-shaped are eligible.<br>
Incidentally, preferably a length of fiber in a range from 2 to 51mm, most<br>
preferably in a range from 2 to 10mm can achieve a good water dispersibiiity.<br>
Further in addition to water dispersibility, preferably fineness (thickness) of fibers<br>
is selected from a range of 1.1 to 4.4 dtex for also having strength not to damage<br>
the pad in use. Especially in using rayon as a fiber, it prefers to select the fiber<br>
having fineness from 1.1 to 3.3 dtex. In case of fineness being less than the<br>
value described above, it is possible to achieve water dispersibility, however in a<br>
dry condition, water dispersibility is extremely deteriorated by easily becoming<br>
fuzz or coming out of fuzz from fibers.<br>
Preferably the amount of the cover sheet is selected from 20 to 60g/m2 by<br>
a specific weight per unit based on specific weight per unit area. Further it is<br>
required that the breaking strength of the cover sheet is 800mN/25mm at least in<br>
both vertical and horizontal directions and preferably is from 1000 to<br>
7000mN/25mm in consideration of the softness in wearing the pad (the breaking<br>
strength of the sheet evaluated from the constant speed extension by a speed<br>
testing 100mm/min in a condition of a knob distance 100mm).<br>
For further concrete structure of the cover sheet, a wet spun lace<br>
non-woven fabric is eligible, that a rayon having a fineness of 1.1 to 4.4dtex and<br>
a length from 5 to 10mm and a wood pulp are mixed in a ratio from 90: 10 to 70:<br>

or fiber-shaped high absorbing polymer, or to use a form by mixing these<br>
materials with same materials for the cover sheet.<br>
In respect of the specific structure of the absorber, for example, the wood<br>
pulp and the like are eligible, that is laminated to the amount from 150 to<br>
500g/m2 by a specific weight per unit to enclose into tissue and is adjusted the<br>
thickness from 2 to 10mm by a press device. It is possible to improve the<br>
absorption capacity or keeping ability of the menstrual blood by mixing absorber<br>
such as starch and the like in a ratio from 5 to 30g/m2.<br>
[Support Sheet]<br>
For materials of the support sheet having biodegradability, water<br>
dispersibility and water solubility, and further impermeability cellulose guide<br>
materials such as methyl cellulose, hydroxyethylcellulose<br>
carboxymethylcellulose and the like , water solubility polymer such as polyvinyl<br>
alcohol, alginic acid, polyacrylic acid soda, polyacrylic ether,<br>
polyvinylpyrrolidone, a copolymer of isobutylene and dry maleic acid , or<br>
biodegradable polymer such as poly lactic acid, polybutylene succinate, starch<br>
and dextrin are eligible.<br>
These materials can be formed in the film-shaped or the sheet-shaped<br>
in individual or by a mixture. At least on one surface, preferably on both<br>
surfaces of the film sheet, waterproof materials such as silicone resin can be<br>
applied or mixed. The laminate paper comprised of the non-woven fabric which<br>
is treated by laminating tissue, is eligible. Further if necessary, the support<br>
sheet can be applied the coloring by mixing the mineral pigment in amount from<br>
0.1 to 5 % of mass.<br>
In respect of the specific structure of an impermeable support sheet, for<br>
example, a laminate paper is formed by a laminating treatment that a film and<br>
tissue are bonded. The film comprises poly lactic acid and tissue has a thickness<br>
from 10 to 20 m m, in the amount from 15 to 20g/m2 by a specific weight per unit<br>
based on the specific weight per unit area, are laminated in area ratio from 5 to<br>
40%. The laminate paper described hereinbefore can keep impermeability<br>
