				<td>TITLE OF THE INVENTION<br>
HETEROARYL PIPERIDINE GLYCINE TRANSPORTER INHIBITORS<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Schizophrenia is a debilitating psychiatric disorder characterized by a combination of negative (blunted affect, withdrawal, anhedonia) and positive (paranoia, hallucinations, delusions) symptoms as well as marked cognitive deficits. While the etiology of schizophrenia is currently unknown, the disease appears to be produced by a complex interaction of biological, environmental, and genetic factors. Over 40 years ago it was found that phencyclidine (PCP) induces a psychotic state in humans that is very similar to that observed in schizophrenic patients. The finding that the main mode of action of PCP is that of a non-competitive antagonist of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) subtype of ionotropic glutamate receptor stimulated a series of studies that have led to the development of the NMDA receptor hypofunction model of schizophrenia (Jentsch JD and Roth RH, 1999 Neuropsychopharmacology, 20:201).<br>
Fast glutamatergic transmission in the mammalian central nervous system is primarily mediated by the excitatory amino acid glutamate acting on ionotropic glutamate receptors (iGluRs). The iGluRs are comprised of three major subclasses, including the Î±-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA), kainate, and NMDA receptor subtypes (Hollmann M and Heinemann S, 1994, Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 17:31). These three subclasses are multimeric ligand-gated cation channels which open in response to glutamate binding to induce a depolarizing excitatory post synaptic current. Molecular cloning has revealed that the NMDA receptor family is composed of two primary subunits, NR1 and NR2. In addition a novel inhibitory subunit which is developmentally regulated termed NR3 has been recently described. A high degree of molecular diversity exists within each set of subunits. To date, only one NR1 subunit gene has been cloned; however, alternative splicing of the NR1 gene can produce eight different subunits. In contrast, 4 genes have been cloned for the NR2 subunit (NR2A, NR2B, NR2C, and NR2D), some of which exhibit alternative splicing (Hollmann M and Heinemann S, 1994, Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 17:31). These multiple subunits form heteromeric glutamate-gated ion channels. While the precise subunit stoichiometry of the naturally occurring receptor remains unknown, both the NR1 and NR2 subunits are required for the expression of functionally active receptor-channel complexes in mammalian expression systems. Activation of the NMDA receptor requires the binding of both glutamate and glycine (Johnson JW and Ascher P, 1987, Nature 325:529). Interestingly, the binding sites for these two co-agonists exist on separate subunits as determined by site-directed mutagenesis studies (Laube B, Hirai H, Sturgess M, Betz H and Kuhse J, 1997, Neuron 18:493). On the NR2A and NR2B subunits, a binding pocket for glutamate is formed by interactions between the N-<br><br>
terminus of the receptor and the extracellular loops. Analogous experiments have placed the glycine binding site in a homologous region of the NR1 subunit (Kuryatov A, Laube B, Betz H and Kuhse J, 1994, Neuron 12:1291). Depending on the actual subunit composition, glutamate and glycine activate the NMDA receptor with EC50 values in the high nanomolar to low inicromolar range. In addition, the pore of the NMDA receptor is impermeable to magnesium. Under normal resting conditions, extracellular magnesium can bind to a site within the pore and produce a magnesium block of the channel. This magnesium block imparts a strong voltage dependence to the channel which allows the NMDA receptor to act as a coincidence detector requiring the binding of glutamate, glycine, and the occurrence of postsynaptic depolarization before conducting current. Of particular interest is the finding that the psychotomimetic drugs MK-801, PCP, and ketamine all act as open channel blockers of the NMDA receptor-channel by binding to a site that overlaps with the magnesium binding site. It is apparent that the rich diversity of NMDA receptor subunits and regulatory sites provides for a complex assortment of physiologically and pharmacologically distinct heteromeric receptors making the NMDA receptor an ideal target for the design of novel therapeutic compounds.<br>
The NMDA receptor plays a critical role in a variety of neurophysiological phenomena, including but not limited to synaptic plasticity, cognition, attention and memory (Bliss T and Collingridge W, 1993, Nature 361:31; Morris RGM et ah, 1986, Nature 319:774). Psychotomimetic drugs constitute a wide class of drugs including psychomotor stimulants (cocaine, amphetamine), hallucinogens (LSD), and NMDA receptor antagonists (PCP, ketamine). Of these, only the NMDA receptor antagonists appear to elicit a robust induction of the positive, negative, and cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia. Controlled studies of ketamine-induced psychosis in human subjects, as well as observations of symptoms from patients abusing PCP as a recreational drug, have produced a convincing list of similarities between NMDA receptor antagonist-induced psychosis and schizophrenia (Jentsch JD and Roth RH, 1999 Neuropsychopharmacology, 20:201). NMDA-receptor antagonists faithfully mimic the symptoms of schizophrenia to the extent that it is difficult to differentiate the two in the clinic. In addition, NMDA receptor antagonists can exacerbate the symptoms in schizophrenics, and can trigger the re-emergence of symptoms in stable patients. Finally, the finding that NMDA receptor co-agonists such as glycine, D-cycloserine, and D-serine produce benefits in schizophrenic patients implicates NMDA receptor hypofunction in this disorder, and indicate that increasing NMDA receptor activation may provide a therapeutic benefit (Leiderman E et al., 1996, Biol. Psychiatry 39:213, Javitt DC et ah, 1994, Am, J. Psychiatry 151:1234, Heresco-Levy U, 2000, Int. J. NeuropsychopharmacoL 3:243, Tsai G et al., 1998, Biol. Psychiatry 44:1081). A large number of studies in animal models lend support to the NMDA hypofunction hypothesis of schizophrenia. Recent generation of a mutant mouse expressing only 5% of normal levels of the NMDA NR1 subunit have shown that this decrease in functional NMDA receptors<br><br>
induces a state very similar to that observed in other animal models of schizophrenia (Mohn AR et al., 1999, Cell 98:427). Besides schizophrenia, dysfunction of glutamatergic pathways has been implicated in a number of disease states in the human central nervous system (CNS) including but not limited to cognitive deficits, dementia, Parkinson disease, Alzheimer disease and bipolar disorder.<br>
NMDA receptor function can be modulated by altering the availability of the co-agonist glycine. This approach has the critical advantage of maintaining activity-dependent activation of the NMDA receptor because an increase in the synaptic concentration of glycine will not produce an activation of NMDA receptors in the absence of glutamate. Since synaptic glutamate levels are tightly maintained by high affinity transport mechanisms, an increased activation of the glycine site will only enhance the NMDA component of activated synapses. Clinical trials in which high doses of glycine were administered orally as an add-on to standard neuroleptic therapy showed an improvement of the symptoms of schizophrenia patients (Javitt et al. Int. J. Neuropsychopharmacol. (2001) 4: 385-391). One way to increase synaptic glycine levels without administering exogenous glycine is to inhibit its removal from the synapse. Evidence that this approach would be useful in treating schizophrenia comes from a double-blind placebo controlled study in which sarcosine was administered to patients suffering from schizophrenia, but who were poorly responsive to antipsychotic drugs. A beneficial effect was observed on positive, negative and cognitive symptoms, indicating that inhibition of glycine re-uptake is a reasonable approach to the treatment of schizophrenia.<br>
Two specific glycine transporters, GlyTl and GlyT2 have been identified and shown to belong to the Na+/Cl" dependent family of neurotransmitter transporters which includes taurine, y-aminobutyric acid (GABA), proline, monoamines and orphan transporters (Smith KE et al., 1992, Neuron 8:927; Borowsky B et al., 1993, Neuron 10:851; Liu QR et al., 1993, J. Biol. Chem. 268:22802; Kim KM et al., 1994, Mol. Pharmacol. 45:608; Morrow JA et al., 1998, FEBS Lett. 439:334; Nelson N, 1998, J. Neurochem. 71:1785). GlyTl and GlyT2 have been isolated from different species and shown to have only 50% identity at the amino acid level. They also have a different pattern of expression in mammalian central nervous system with GlyT2 being expressed in spinal cord, brainstem and cerebellum and GlyTl present in these regions as well as forebrain areas such as cortex, hippocampus, septum and thalamus (Smith KE et al., 1992, Neuron 8:927; Borowsky B et al., 1993, Neuron 10:851; Liu QR et al., 1993, J. Biol. Chem. 268:22802). At the cellular level, GlyT2 has been reported to be expressed by glycinergic nerve endings in rat spinal cord whereas GlyTl appears to be preferentially expressed by glial cells (Zafra F et al., 1995, J. Neurosci. 15:3952). These expression studies have led to the conclusion that GlyT2 is predominantly responsible for glycine uptake at glycinergic synapses whereas GlyTl is involved in monitoring glycine concentration in the vicinity of NMDA receptor expressing synapses. Recent functional studies in rat have shown that blockade of GlyTl with the potent inhibitor<br><br>
(N-[3-(4'-fluorophenyl)-3-(4'-pheny]phenoxy)propyl])sarcosine (NFPS) potentiates NMDA receptor activity and NMDA receptor-dependent long-term potentiation in rat (Bergeron R et al., 1998, PNAS USA 95:15730; Kinney G et al., 2003, J. Neurosci. 23:7586). Furthermore, NFPS has been reported to enhance pre-pulse inhibition in mice, a measure of sensory gating that is known to be deficient in schizophrenia patients (Kinney G et al., 2003, J. Neurosci. 23:7586). These physiological effects of GlyTl in forebrain regions together with clinical reports showing the beneficial effects of GlyTl inhibitor sarcosine in improving symptoms in schizophrenia patients (Tsai and Coyle W099/52519) indicate that selective GlyTl uptake inhibitors represent a new class of antipsychotic drugs.<br>

The compounds of the present invention may contain one or more chiral centers and can thus occur as racemates and racemic mixtures, single enantiomers, diastereomeric mixtures and individual diastereomers. Additional asymmetric centers may be present depending upon the nature of the various substituents on the molecule. Each such asymmetric center will independently produce two optical isomers and it is intended that all of the possible optical isomers and diastereomers in mixtures and as pure or partially purified compounds are included within the ambit of this invention. The present invention is meant to comprehend all such isomeric forms of these compounds. Formula I shows the structure of the class of compounds without preferred stereochemistry.<br>
The independent syntheses of these diastereomers or their chromatographic separations may be achieved as known in the art by appropriate modification of the methodology disclosed herein. Their absolute stereochemistry may be determined by the x-ray crystallography of crystalline products or crystalline intermediates which are derivatized, if necessary, with a reagent containing an asymmetric center of known absolute configuration.<br>
If desired, racemic mixtures of the compounds Inay be separated so that the individual enantiomers are isolated. The separation can be carried out by methods well known in the art, such as the coupling of a racemic mixture of compounds to an enantiomerically pure compound to form a diastereomeric mixture, followed by separation of the individual diastereomers by standard methods, such as fractional crystallization or chromatography. The coupling reaction is often the formation of salts using an enantiomerically pure acid or base. The diasteromeric derivatives may then be converted to the pure enantiomers by cleavage of the added chiral residue. The racemic mixture of the compounds can also be separated directly by chromatographic methods utilizing chiral stationary phases, which methods are well known in the art.<br>
Alternatively, any enantiomer of a compound may be obtained by stereoselective synthesis using optically pure starting materials or reagents of known configuration by methods well known in the art.<br>

The utility of the compounds in accordance with the present invention as inhibiting the glycine transporter activity, in particular GlyTl activity, may be demonstrated by methodology known in the art. Human placental choriocarcinoma cells (JAR cells (ATCC No. HTB-144)) endogenously expressing GlyTl were cultured in 96-well Cytostar scintillating microplates (Amersham Biosciences) in RPMI1640 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum in the presence of penicillin (100 micrograms/milliliter) and streptomycin (100 micrograms/ milliliter). Cells were grown at 37Â°C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% C02 for 40-48 hours before the assay. Culture medium was removed from the Cytostar plate, and JAR cells were incubated with 30 microliters of TB1A buffer (120 mM NaCl, 2 mM KC1,1 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2,10 mM HEPES, 5 mM L-alanine, pH 7.5 adjusted with Tris base) with or without the compounds of the present invention for 1 minute. Then 30 microliters of [14C]-glycine diluted with TBI A was added to each well to give a final concentration of 10 micromolar. After incubation at room temperature for 3 hours, the Cytostar scintillating microplates were sealed and counted on a Top Count scintillation counter (Packard). Non-specific uptake of [14C]-glycine was determined in the presence of 10 mM unlabeled glycine. [14C]taurine uptake experiments were performed according to the same protocol except that 10 mM unlabeled taurine was used to determine non-specific uptake. To determine potencies, a range of concentrations of the compounds of the present invention was added to the cells, followed by the fixed concentration of [14C]glycine. The concentration of the present compound that inhibited half of the specific uptake of [14C]glycine (IC50 value) was determined from the assay data by non-linear curve fitting.<br>
In particular, the compounds of the following examples had activity in inhibiting specific uptake of [14C]glycine in the aforementioned assay, generally with an IC50 value of less than about 10 micromolar. Preferred compounds within the present invention had activity in inhibiting specific uptake of [14C]glycine in the aforementioned assay with an IC50 value of less than about 1 micromolar. These compounds were selective for [14C]glycine uptake (by GlyTl in the JAR cells) compared to [14C]taurine uptake (by the taurine transporter TauT in the JAR cells). Such a result is indicative of the intrinsic activity of the compounds in use as inhibitors of GlyTl transporter activity.<br>
The NMDA receptor is central to a wide range of CNS processes, and plays a role in a variety of disease states in humans or other species. The action of GlyTl transporters affects the local concentration of glycine around NMDA receptors. Selective GlyTl inhibitors slow the removal of<br><br>
glycine from the synapse, causing the level of synaptic glycine to rise. This in turn increases the occupancy of the glycine binding site on the NMDA receptor, which increases activation of the NMDA receptor following glutamate release from the presynaptic terminal. Because a certain amount of glycine is needed for the efficient functioning of NMDA receptors, any change to that local concentration can affect NMDA-mediated neurotransmission. Changes in NMDA-mediated neurotransmission have been implicated in certain neuropsychiatric disorders such as dementia, depression and psychoses, for example schizophrenia, and learning and memory disorders, for example attention deficit disorders and autism.<br>
