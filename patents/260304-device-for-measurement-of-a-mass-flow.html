				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The invention relates to a device for measuring the mass flow, in particular, for<br>
measuring a bulk material flow in accordance with the preamble of claim 1.<br>
In practice, conveyor belt scales, measuring chutes, impact plates or measuring devices<br>
based on the Coriolis principle are used predominantly for continuously determining the<br>
flow rate of mass flows, preferably bulk material flows. Preferably mass flow-rate<br>
measuring devices operating in accordance with the Coriolis principle are used<br>
particularly for the high-precision measurement of bulk materials, such as granules, well<br>
flowing powders, grains and the like. These mass flow-rate measuring devices use the<br>
Coriolis force for determining the feed advance rate which force occurs while<br>
transporting bulk material particles through a rotating impeller wheel. Here, the impeller<br>
wheel comprises guide blades arranged in a star-shaped manner through which the bulk<br>
material is accelerated outwardly. The impeller wheel rotates at a constant angular speed.<br>
The Coriolis acceleration, which occurs when the bulk material particles are moving,<br>
imposes a torque on the measuring wheel which torque is proportional to the mass flow<br>
rate. Thus, this measuring method is suitable to detect bulk material flows with high<br>
precision because, unlike impact plate systems and measuring chute systems, there is no<br>
physical value which is influenced by the characteristics of the bulk material and which<br>
enters into the sensitivity of the device. However, one drawback of the Coriolis<br>
measuring devices is that the Coriolis forces produced by the mass flow are very small<br>
relative to the radial acceleration forces and the disturbing forces resulting therefrom.<br>
2<br><br>
As a result, the precision depends very much on the decoupling of the disturbing forces<br>
and frictional forces from the measuring train.<br>
A known measuring device for determining the mass flow rate of bulk materials in<br>
accordance with the Coriolis principle is known from German Patent publication DE 33<br>
46 145 C2. This measuring device comprises an impeller wheel with radially disposed<br>
guide blades, which are arranged on a horizontal plate. The impeller wheel is connected<br>
to a drive shaft, which is driven by a motor at constant speed. The motor is rotatably<br>
mounted by two ball bearings and is supported on a force transducer, which detects the<br>
drive torque. In principle, the drive torque is proportional to the mass flow and can be<br>
displayed in an evaluating unit as the feed advance rate or as feeding quantity. However,<br>
in this rotatably arranged measuring train comprising the force-measuring device, the<br>
rotatably mounted drive motor and the driven impeller wheel, there occur in the ball<br>
bearings, frictional forces which are included in the measured value and thus may lead to<br>
measurement inaccuracies particularly when the friction values are changing. The high<br>
axial forces to be absorbed in the measurement bearing additionally increase the friction<br>
in the bearings.<br>
Another mass flow rate measuring device operating in accordance with the Coriolis<br>
principle is known from the European Patent publication EP 0 474 121 Bl. This device<br>
comprises a measuring gear in the drive train for reducing the friction forces. For this<br>
purpose, the drive shaft of the impeller wheel is guided to the measuring gear housing<br>
through a stationary sleeve. A spur gear wheel is secured to the drive shaft in the<br>
measuring gear housing. The spur gear wheel meshes with an intermediate spur gear<br>
wheel and with a driving spur gear wheel, which is secured to the drive shaft of the<br>
motor. The intermediate spur gear wheel is suspended in a tangentially movable manner<br>
and connected to a force-measuring device, which detects the tangential forces, which are<br>
proportional to the mass flow rate. In order to avoid friction forces in the measuring train,<br>
3<br><br>
the drive shaft is secured below the spur gear wheel in an anti-friction bearing. The inner<br>
ring of the anti-friction bearing is connected to the drive shaft and the outer ring of the<br>
anti-friction bearing is connected to the inner ring of a second anti-friction bearing. The<br>
outer ring of the first anti-friction bearing is separately driven by additional spur gear<br>
wheels, wherein a drive speed is suggested which corresponds at least to the drive speed<br>
of the drive shaft. As a result, only the friction force of the first anti-friction bearing in<br>
the measuring train is compensated, wherein the drive shaft rotating at high speed in the<br>
sleeve is likely to cause additional bearing frictions. In practice, this bearing friction in<br>
the sleeve to the bulk material housing section is kept small by air bearings as disclosed<br>
in German Patent publication DE 35 07 993 C2. However, such air bearings require very<br>
high production costs and a separate compressed air connection. However, frictional<br>
influences are not excluded even in connection with such air bearings, particularly if<br>
unilateral radial accelerations occur due to strongly fluctuating mass flow changes or due<br>
to non-uniform loading of the impeller wheel. Such unilateral radial accelerations impose<br>
an imbalance on the impeller wheel, wherein the drive shaft may contact the bearing<br>
sleeve. Furthermore, pressure fluctuations in the bulk material container may lead to the<br>
penetration of the bearing area by strongly abrasive bulk material dust, wherein friction<br>
changes may occur in the measuring path.<br>
DE 102 53 078 B3 discloses a Coriolis measuring device for detecting bulk material<br>
flows, which measuring device comprises an impeller wheel, which is connected to a<br>
drive shaft and is driven at constant speed by an electric motor. The impeller wheel<br>
deflects an axially impinged mass flow in the radial direction and imparts a radial and<br>
tangential speed component to it. The drive shaft is surrounded by a bearing sleeve in<br>
which the drive shaft is mounted rotatably. The bearing sleeve protrudes into the housing<br>
space of the impeller wheel and is driven by a separate spur gear wheel at a speed<br>
corresponding to that of the drive shaft. The bearing sleeve is mounted rotatably in a<br>
stationary drive housing part so that basically no relative speed occurs between the drive<br>
shaft and the bearing sleeve. The drive shaft and the bearing sleeve end or. the drive side<br>
in a closed stationary gear housing part, wherein the drive shaft is connected to a spur<br>
gear wheel, which meshes with an intermediate spur gear wheel and which is driven by a<br>
4<br><br>
driving spur gear wheel. The intermediate spur gear wheel is supported on a force-<br>
transmitting arm, which is held by a force-measuring device in its radial position.<br>
However, since the intermediate spur gear wheel is mounted rotatably in ball bearings on<br>
the force-transmitting arm in the drive train, and the force-transmitting arm is mounted<br>
rotatably by means of another ball bearing on the gear housing part, bearing points occur<br>
in the measuring branch which are subject to friction and can lead to measurement errors.<br>
Since these friction values are particularly temperature-dependent, such influences cannot<br>
be always compensated for completely by means of calibration measures.<br>
It is therefore the object of the invention to improve the measuring accuracy of a mass<br>
flow-measuring device according to the Coriolis principle by using the simplest<br>
mechanical design.<br>
This object is achieved by the invention specified in claim 1. Refinements and<br>
advantageous exemplary embodiments of the invention are specified in the dependent<br>
clauses.<br>
The advantage of the invention is the t by means of the arrangement of the force-<br>
measuring device between the drive shaft supporting the impeller wheel and the rotating<br>
bearing sleeve, the drive torque for determining the Coriolis force can take place in an<br>
almost frictionless manner since the drive shaft basically does not rotate in the bearing<br>
sleeve. As a result, measurement errors involving friction cannot occur to a large extent.<br>
It is thus simultaneously possible to dispense with an expensive measuring gear,<br>
5<br><br>
which was necessary heretofore for an independent drive both of the bearing sleeve as<br>
well as of the drive shaft. Simultaneously, the measuring bearing is impinged upon<br>
advantageously with only small axial forces, and this impingement in turn has friction-<br>
reducing effects.<br>
Another advantage of the invention is that due to the direct arrangement of the force-<br>
measuring device in the interior zone of the bearing sleeve, the former is mounted in a<br>
space-saving manner, due to which particularly the overall height could be reduced<br>
considerably. Due to the detection of the drive torque between the bearing sleeve and the<br>
drive shaft, it is also advantageously possible to install rotationally symmetric torque<br>
sensors, which compensated for imbalance effects or transverse deflections even in multi-<br>
phase, non-uniform bulk material flows. Furthermore, the transfer of axial or radial<br>
disturbing forces onto the torque sensor is-also prevented in acorresponding arrangement<br>
of the bearing. The integration of the force-measuring device in the bearing sleeve and<br>
the omission of the large-volume measuring gear also enable a relatively narrow drive<br>
housing part, along which the radially deflected mass flow can flow past laterally. As a<br>
result, the entrance openings and discharge openings could be advantageously arranged<br>
axially on top of one another, thereby facilitating the installation in a necessary feed pipe<br>
system.<br>
Due to the laterally parallel arrangement of the drive motor in a special embodiment of<br>
the invention, only a relatively small overall height is required particularly in the case of<br>
a measuring device for large feed advance rates. As a result, the device can also be<br>
retrofitted in existing pipe systems having short straight overall lengths or spaces having<br>
small overall heights are also sufficient.<br>
6<br><br>
The advantage of a special embodiment of the invention in which the measurement signal<br>
is transferred using a telemetric device is that conventional slip ring connections afflicted<br>
with interference could be replaced by a simple wireless signal transmission even in the<br>
case of rotating bearing sleeves. Here the advantage, particularly of an inductive<br>
coupling, is that it is thus possible to simultaneously transmit even the feed energy to the<br>
force transducers or torque sensors that are equipped with strain gauges.<br>
The invention will now be explained in more detail with reference to an exemplary<br>
embodiment, which is shown in the drawing.<br>
The drawing schematically shows the sectional view of a measuring device for detecting<br>
bulk material flows in accordance with the Coriolis principle, which device substantially<br>
comprises a housing part 1 in which an impeller wheel 2 rotates and a driving and<br>
measuring device disposed therebelow. The drive shaft 3 of the impeller wheel protrudes<br>
through a driven bearing sleeve 4 into the impeller wheel housing part 1. The bearing<br>
sleeve 4 is mounted rotatably in a stationary drive housing part 9, wherein a force-<br>
measuring device 7 is disposed inside the bearing sleeve 4 between the latter and the<br>
drive shaft 3.<br>
During a measuring operation the bulk material flow 10 is axially admitted as a mass<br>
flow to the impeller wheel 2 through an entrance opening 6. The impeller wheel 2<br>
comprises a horizontally disposed disc having radial guide blades and deflects the axially<br>
impinging bulk material 10 radially outwardly. The impeller wheel 2 rotates at a constant<br>
speed and accelerates the bulk material flow 10 radially outwardly as a result of which,<br>
due to the Coriolis force, a braking torque is generated which is proportional to the mass<br>
flow 10. For achieving a dustproof measuring operation, the impeller wheel 2 is<br>
accommodated in an enclosed housing part 1, which has in its lower portion a discharge<br>
7<br><br>
opening 24 through which the measured bulk material 10 can be fed to a subsequent<br>
process.<br>
The impeller wheel 2 is constructed to have a rotational symmetry and includes a central<br>
drive shaft 3, which is disposed vertically and which comprises at its lower end a driving<br>
pin 14 in the form of drive means, which meshes with the force-rneasuring device 7. The<br>
drive shaft 3 is coaxially surrounded by the bearing sleeve 4, which extends from the<br>
impeller wheel housing chamber 8 to the drive housing part 9 positioned below the<br>
impeller wheel housing. The bearing sleeve 4 is substantially constructed in a tubular<br>
shape and extends in its axial length beyond the drive shaft 3 and its lower cross-sectional<br>
surface is closed in a cylindrical manner. The drive shaft 3 is mounted rotatably in the<br>
bearing sleeve 4 by means of two axially spaced anti-friction bearings 22 in the form of<br>
radial bearings. The lower horizontal end surface of the drive shaft 3 is supported axially<br>
on a central ball bearing 23, which rests on a transverse web 25 in the bearing sleeve 4,<br>
thereby representing a largely frictionless axial bearing of the drive shaft 3.<br>
Simultaneously, due to the arrangement of the bearings 22 and 23 it is ensured thai no<br>
axial or radial disturbing forces whatsoever can act on the measuring body 7. Since the<br>
drive shaft 3 is rotatable only slightly by at most 5° in relation to the bearing sleeve 4,<br>
both the bearing friction of the radial 22 and of the axial bearing 23 are negligible.<br>
However, the radial bearings could also be designed as air bearings in order to improve<br>
the bearing friction. However, for reasons of economy, a slide bearing could also be<br>
provided which is sufficient particularly in the case of measuring devices having smaller<br>
mass flows. As long as it is permitted by the space requirement, the drive shaft 3 could<br>
also be mounted radially in a frictionless manner by means of a so-called cruciform<br>
spring element corresponding to DE 103 30 947.0.<br>
8<br><br>
The drive shaft 3 is protected in relation to the impeller wheel housing chamber 8 with a<br>
bearing sealing 26 against penetrating bulk material. Since the drive shaft 3 rotates only<br>
slightly in relation to the bearing sleeve 4, a permanent tight connection can be selected<br>
here. Preferably closely abutting rubber seals are used here which only have to be flexible<br>
in the rotational direction. In a simplified embodiment, it is also conceivable to fix the<br>
drive shaft 3 by means of an elastomer on the inner surface of the bearing sleeve 4 both<br>
for sealing the drive shaft against penetrating bulk material and also for the radial bearing<br>
of the drive shaft, wherein the most frictionless possible flexibility must be ensured only<br>
in the rotational direction.<br>
The bearing sleeve 4 on its part is likewise rotatably mounted in the stationary drive<br>
housing part 9 in the radial and axial directions by means of two anti-friction bearings 21<br>
and is sealed in a dustproof manner in relation to the impeller wheel housing chamber 8<br>
by means of a sealing element 27. The sealing element 27 can also be integrated in the<br>
anti-friction bearing 21 or it may be constructed as an O-ring seal. Since neither the anti-<br>
friction bearing 21 nor the sealing element 27 comes into contact with the measured drive<br>
shaft 3, the friction values of the sealing element 27 are negligible in terms of<br>
measurement. As a result, the anti-friction bearing can be dimensioned such that it<br>
provides primarily a superior stiffness and the sealing effect can be dimensioned such<br>
that it provides superior sealing effect even relative to abrasive bulk material dust.<br>
In the lower drive housing part 9, a gear wheel or a belt pulley 19 is provided as the<br>
bearing sleeve drive wheel for the common drive of the drive shaft 3 and of the bearing<br>
sleeve 4. This bearing sleeve drive wheel is arranged in an annular manner around the<br>
lower part of the bearing sleeve 4 and is permanently connected thereto. Laterally next to<br>
the bearing sleeve drive wheel 19 and in the lower drive housing part 9, the drive motor 5<br>
is fixed to a drive wheel 28, which is located on its drive shaft and is preferably<br>
connected to the bearing sleeve drive wheel 19 by means of a toothed belt 20. However,<br>
9<br><br>
this motor drive can also take place by means of a chain drive, flat belt drive, V-belt drive<br>
or gear wheel drive. This drive motor 5, located parallel to the bearing sleeve 4<br>
advantageously permits a horizontal drive which helps achieve a small overall height.<br>
However, it is also conceivable to arrange the drive motor 5 directly below the bearing<br>
sleeve 4 and to connect it to the latter by means of a fixed coupling. However, the lateral<br>
arrangement permits a housing 1 in which the entrance openings 6 and the discharge<br>
openings 24 are located axially on top of one another and thus can be advantageously<br>
integrated in a straight vertical feed pipe part. An electric motor is provided as a drive<br>
motor 5, which is designed preferably as a simple asynchronous motor.<br>
In the lower part of the bearing sleeve 4, the force-measuring device 7 is arranged which<br>
meshes with the driving pin 14. The force-measuring device 7 is designed as a force<br>
transducer or as a load cel-l and it transfers the drive force from the driven bearing sleeve<br>
4 onto the drive shaft 3 and is thus arranged directly between the bearing sleeve and the<br>
drive shaft. In the exemplary embodiment, a double bending beam transducer is provided<br>
as the force-measuring device 7, which however could also be replaced by a rotationally<br>
symmetric load cell or a torque sensor. For this purpose, rotationally symmetric torque<br>
sensors having spoke-like deformation bodies are used preferably as torque sensors on<br>
which strain gauges are arranged, which can be fixed coaxially to the drive shaft 3 or<br>
along its extension between the latter and the bearing sleeve 4. Since the double bending<br>
beam 7 used is designed as a strain gauge sensor, the braking torque which is<br>
proportional to the mass flow is detected by means of a slight tangential deflection of the<br>
double bending beam, wherein measurement ranges of 0.1 to 0.5 mm on the load cell are<br>
common. Thus the drive shaft 3 rotates largely synchronously at the sleeve speed,<br>
10<br><br>
wherein between the two a maximum rotation angle of 5° is possible. The force-<br>
measuring device 7 is preferably arranged symmetrically to the common rotation axis of<br>
the drive shaft 3 and the bearing sleeve, wherein the driving pin 14 is supported in an<br>
oscillating manner on the double bending beam.<br>
The drive shaft 3 could also be guided at the bottom out of the bearing sleeve 4 through a<br>
borehole, wherein the force-measuring device 7 could then be accommodated in a<br>
separate sleeve part having an increased inner diameter and designed as a hollow body<br>
connected to the bearing sleeve.<br>
Below the force-measuring device 7, a telemetric device 15 is also provided by means of<br>
which the measurement signals are transmitted in a contactless manner by the force<br>
transducer 7 to an evaluating device. For this purpose, the force transducer 7 is connected<br>
to an inductive transmitting device 16, by means of which the measurement signals are<br>
transmitted inductively to an inductive receiving device 17 arranged opposite to the<br>
transmitting device. Simultaneously, the inductive receiving device 17 serves for<br>
transmitting the supply voltage to the transmitting device 16, which serves for feeding the<br>
strain gauges in the double bending beam. The received measurement signals can then be<br>
transmitted by means of a galvanic connection or also a wireless transmission path to an<br>
evaluating device (not shown), which evaluates the measurement signals and displays<br>
them or processes them further. The transmission of the measurement signals is<br>
preferably carried out by means of a carrier frequency alternating current or also by<br>
means of an infrared transmission.<br>
The stationary drive housing part 9 is substantially designed to be cylindrical and is<br>
installed in the stationary impeller wheel housing part 1, wherein the motor housing part<br>
is guided laterally out of the impeller housing part 1 and represents a part of the drive<br>
housing part 9. The upper side of the impeller wheel housing part 1 comprises the<br>
11<br><br>
entrance opening 6, which contains preferably a connecting flange, which can be screwed<br>
to a feed pipe. The impeller wheel housing 1 is designed to be conical in the flow<br>
direction and is spaced apart from the drive housing part 9 to such an extent that the bulk<br>
material flowing through is conveyed vertically from the entrance opening 6 to the<br>
discharge opening 24, which is located axially thereunder and which can likewise be<br>
connected to a feed pipe. It is thus advantageously possible to provide measuring devices<br>
with heights of 250 mm and above with which feeding quantities of 20 tons per second<br>
can be measured. With measuring devices having overall heights of 900 mm and above, it<br>
is possible to realize constructions measuring feeding quantities of up to 600 tons per<br>
second.<br>
The function of the measuring device will be explained in more detail with reference to<br>
the drawing. In an idling operation when there is no bulk material flow guided onto the<br>
impeller wheel 2 it is merely necessary to provide a drive torque or a braking torque<br>
through the bearing sleeve 4 which torque corresponds to the friction in the measuring<br>
train. Due to the fact that no friction occurs in this portion of the measuring train because<br>
the bearing sleeve 4 rotates in synchronism with the drive shaft 3, only the bearing<br>
friction, which occurs due to vibrations or small fluctuations in speed, must be applied by<br>
the bearing sleeve 4. The frictions occurring in this portion are relatively small because<br>
the drive shaft 3 moves only slightly in the bearing sleeve 4 due to such forces and there<br>
also hardly occurs any friction due to the anti-slide bearing 22. A corresponding idling<br>
torque is therefore generated basically only by air turbulences on the impeller wheel 2.<br>
This constant idling torque is compensated by taring the measuring device so that a high<br>
zero point constancy is achieved due to the almost frictionless drive shaft bearing 22.<br>
When a bulk material flow 10 is axially admitted on the impeller wheel 2, a radial<br>
acceleration of the bulk material flow 10 occurs due to the deflection. Due to the bulk<br>
material flow, a Coriolis force generates an additional braking torque on the drive shaft 3.<br>
12<br><br>
This braking torque is directly proportional to the mass flow. As a result, the force-<br>
measuring device 7 that meshes with the drive shaft 3, is tangentially deflected by a<br>
maximum of 0.1 to 0.5 mm and this braking torque is transmitted from the drive shaft 3<br>
onto the double bending beam transducer 7. Thus, the force detected by the double<br>
bending beam transducer 7 represents a value for the mass flow or bulk material flow 10<br>
passing through the impeller wheel 2. The feed advance rate or feeding quantity of the<br>
mass flow passing through the impeller wheel 2 becomes determinable and displayable<br>
with the aid of an evaluating unit (not shown) and by means of the known geometric<br>
dimensions of the impeller wheel 2 and the length of the lever arm of the double bending<br>
beam transducer 7.<br>
Theoretically it is assumable that at a constant drive speed of the impeller wheel 2, the<br>
required drive torque between the impeller wheel 2 and its drive is exactly proportional to<br>
the mass flow rate. In practice, however, this proportionality is influenced by additional<br>
braking torques, which occur due to friction influences in the measuring train. This<br>
problem has been solved by the measure according to the invention that all friction<br>
influences are completely eliminated in the measuring train at the drive shaft bearing and<br>
in the transition to the impeller wheel housing chamber 8. This elimination is achieved by<br>
arranging the force-measuring device 7 directly between the drive shaft 3 and the bearing<br>
sleeve 4, by means of which force-measuring device there occurs almost no relative<br>
movement between the drive shaft 3 and the bearing sleeve 4 so that the drive shaft 3 is<br>
mounted along its entire length up to the force-measuring device 7 in a frictionless<br>
manner. In this connection, it is irrelevant what type of rotational bearing 22 is provided<br>
between the drive shaft 3 and the bearing sleeve 4 so that simple bearings can also be<br>
provided. On the other hand, the invention shifts the friction influences into the area<br>
between the outer jacket of the bearing sleeve 4 and the stationary drive housing part 9.<br>
Thus, basically the drive shaft 3 is decoupled from friction influences all the way into<br>
13<br><br>
the impeller wheel housing chamber 8 because the axial and radial bearing 21 of the<br>
sleeve 4, which bearing is subject to friction, is not arranged in the measuring train up to<br>
the force-measuring device 7. It is therefore almost impossible for friction influences at<br>
the bearing seal 26 and bulk material dust possibly entering there to be able to influence<br>
the measuring accuracy. Therefore, temperature fluctuations occurring in this area in the<br>
bulk material are basically negligible for the measuring accuracy because although this<br>
causes the bearing friction between the bearing sleeve 4 and the drive housing part 9 to<br>
fluctuate, this variation does not influence the detectable drive torque, which acts on the<br>
double bending beam transducer 7 in the measuring train. Thus, it is advantageously<br>
possible to provide sealing elements 27 that are subject to friction at the bearing 21<br>
between the bearing sleeve 4 and the drive housing part 9. Such sealing elements ensure a<br>
permanent sealing for bulk materials having strongly abrasive dust components.<br>
The frictionless drive shaft bearing of the invention and simultaneously its arrangement<br>
ensure that no axial or radial disturbing forces whatsoever act on the measuring body.<br>
The frictionless drive shaft bearing of the invention also particularly improves the<br>
measuring accuracy for small mass flows 10 since the then necessary relatively high<br>
impeller wheel speeds tend to cause relatively strong imbalances even in the case of<br>
smaller fluctuations in the bulk flow and uneven impeller wheel loadings. These strong<br>
imbalances cannot become effective in the measuring train. Furthermore, such a<br>
frictionless bearing of the measuring train permits a relatively small diameter of the<br>
bearing sleeve drive wheel 19 in relation to the diameter of the impeller wheel. The small<br>
diameter of the bearing sleeve drive wheel permits the achievement of a higher<br>
measurement signal sensitivity because braking torque fluctuations that are subject to<br>
friction are minimized in the measuring train. As a result, a high zero point constancy is<br>
ensured even for small bulk material flows 10.<br>
