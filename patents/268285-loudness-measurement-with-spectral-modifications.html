Loudness Measurement with Spectral Modifications<br>
Technical Field<br>
The invention relates to audio signal processing. In particular, the invention<br>
relates to measuring the perceived loudness of an audio signal by modifying a spectral<br>
representation of an audio signal as a function of a reference spectral shape so that the<br>
spectral representation of the audio signal conforms more closely to the reference spectral<br>
shape, and calculating the perceived loudness of the modified spectral representation of<br>
the audio signal.<br>
References and Incorporation by Reference<br>
Certain techniques for objectively measuring perceived (psychoacoustic) loudness<br>
useful in better understanding aspects the present invention are described in published<br>
International patent application WO 2004/111994 A2, of Alan Jeffrey Seefeldt et al,<br>
published December 23, 2004, entitled "Method, Apparatus and Computer Program for<br>
Calculating and Adjusting the Perceived Loudness of an Audio Signal", in the resulting<br>
U.S. Patent Application published as US 2007/0092089, published April 26, 2007, and in<br>
"A New Objective Measure of Perceived Loudness" by Alan Seefeldt et al, Audio<br>
Engineering Society Convention Paper 6236, San Francisco, October 28, 2004. Said WO<br>
2004/111994 A2 and US 2007/0092089 applications and said paper are hereby<br>
incorporated by reference in their entirety.<br>
Background Art<br>
Many methods exist for objectively measuring the perceived loudness of audio<br>
signals. Examples of methods include A-, B- and C-weighted power measures as well as<br>
psychoacoustic models of loudness such as described in "Acoustics — Method for<br>
calculating loudness level," ISO 532 (1975) and said WO 2004/111994 A2 and US<br>
2007/0092089 applications. Weighted power measures operate by taking an input audio<br>
signal, applying a known filter that emphasizes more perceptibly sensitive frequencies<br>
while deemphasizing less perceptibly sensitive frequencies, and then averaging the power<br>
of the filtered signal over a predetermined length of time. Psychoacoustic methods are<br>
typically more complex and aim to model better the workings of the human ear. Such<br>
psychoacoustic methods divide the signal into frequency bands that mimic the frequency<br>
response and sensitivity of the ear, and then manipulate and integrate such bands while<br>
taking into account psychoacoustic phenomenon, such as frequency and temporal<br>
masking, as well as the non-linear perception of loudness with varying signal intensity.<br>
The aim of all such methods is to derive a numerical measurement that closely matches<br>
the subjective impression of the audio signal.<br>
The inventor has found that the described objective loudness measurements fail to<br>
match subjective impressions accurately for certain types of audio signals. In said WO<br>
2004/111994 A2 and US 2007/0092089 applications such problem signals were described<br>
as "narrowband", meaning that the majority of the signal energy is concentrated in one or<br>
several small portions of the audible spectrum. In said applications, a method to deal<br>
with such signals was disclosed involving the modification of a traditional psychoacoustic<br>
model of loudness perception to incorporate two growth of loudness functions: one for<br>
"wideband" signals and a second for "narrowband" signals. The WO 2004/111994 A2<br>
and US 2007/009208.9 applications describe an interpolation between the two functions<br>
based on a measure of the signal's "narrowbandedness".<br>
While such an interpolation method does improve the performance of the<br>
objective loudness measurement with respect to subjective impressions, the inventor has<br>
since developed an alternate psychoacoustic model of loudness perception that he<br>
believes explains and resolves the differences between objective and subjective loudness<br>
measurements for "narrowband" problem signals in a better manner. The application of<br>
such an alternative model to the objective measurement of loudness constitutes an aspect<br>
of the present invention.<br>

Disclosure of the Invention<br>
According to aspects of the invention, a method for measuring the perceived<br>
loudness of an audio signal, comprises obtaining a spectral representation of the audio<br>
signal, modifying the spectral representation as a function of a reference spectral shape so<br>
that the spectral representation of the audio signal conforms more closely to a reference<br>
spectral shape, and calculating the perceived loudness of the modified spectral<br>
representation of the audio signal. Modifying the spectral representation as a function of<br>
a reference spectral shape may include minimizing a function of the differences between<br>
the spectral representation and the reference spectral shape and setting a level for the<br>
reference spectral shape in response to the minimizing. Minimizing a function of the<br>
differences may minimize a weighted average of differences between the spectral<br>
representation and the reference spectral shape. Minimizing a function of the differences<br>
may further include applying an offset to alter the differences between the spectral<br>
representation and the reference spectral shape. The offset may be a fixed offset.<br>
Modifying the spectral representation as a function of a reference spectral shape may<br>
further include taking the maximum level of the spectral representation of the audio<br>
signal and of the level-set reference spectral shape. The spectral representation of the<br>
audio signal may be an excitation signal that approximates the distribution of energy<br>
along the basilar membrane of the inner ear.<br>
According to further aspects of the invention, a method of pleasuring the<br>
perceived loudness of an audio signal comprises obtaining a representation of the audio<br>
signal, comparing the representation of the audio signal to a reference representation to<br>
detennine how closely the representation of the audio signal matches the reference<br>
representation, modifying at least a portion of the representation of the audio signal so<br>
that the resulting modified representation of the audio signal matches more closely the<br>
reference representation, and determining a perceived loudness of the audio signal from<br>
the modified representation of the audio signal. Modifying at least a portion of the<br>
representation of the audio signal may include adjusting the level of the reference<br>
representation with respect to the level of the representation of the audio signal. The level<br>
of the reference representation may be adjusted so as to minimize a function of the<br>
differences between the level of the reference representation and the level of the<br>
representation of the audio signal. Modifying at least a portion of the representation of<br>
the audio signal may include increasing the level of portions of the audio signal.<br>
According to yet further aspects of the invention, a method of determining the<br>
perceived loudness of an audio signal comprises obtaining a representation of the audio<br>
signal, comparing the spectral shape of the audio signal representation to a reference<br>
spectral shape, adjusting a level of the reference spectral shape to match the spectral<br>
shape of the audio signal representation so that differences between the spectral shape of<br>
the audio signal representation and the reference spectral shape are reduced, forming a<br>
modified spectral shape of the audio signal representation by increasing portions of the<br>
spectral shape of the audio signal representation to improve further the match between the<br>
spectral shape of the audio signal representation and the reference spectral shape, and<br>
determining a perceived loudness of the audio signal based upon the modified spectral<br>
shape of the audio signal representation. The adjusting may include minimizing a<br>
function of the differences between the spectral shape of the audio signal representation<br>
and the reference spectral shape and setting a level for the reference spectral shape in<br>
response to the minimizing. Minimizing a function of the differences may minimize a<br>
weighted average of differences between the spectral shape of the audio signal<br>
representation and the reference spectral shape. Minimizing a function of the differences<br>
further may include applying an offset to alter the differences between the spectral shape<br>
of the audio signal representation and the reference spectral shape. The offset may be a<br>
fixed offset. Modifying the spectral representation as a function of a reference spectral<br>
shape may further include taking the maximum level of the spectra! representation of the<br>
audio signal and of the level-set reference spectral shape.<br>
According to the further aspects and yet further aspects of the present invention,<br>
the audio signal representation may be an excitation signal that approximates the<br>
distribution of energy along the basilar membrane of the inner ear.<br>
Other aspects of the invention include apparatus performing any of the above-<br>
recited methods and a computer program, stored on a computer-readable medium for<br>
causing a computer to perform any of the above-recited methods.<br>
Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
In a general sense, all of the objective loudness measurements mentioned earlier<br>
(both weighted power measurements and psychoacoustic models) may be viewed as<br>
integrating across frequency some representation of the spectrum of the audio signal. In<br>
the case of weighted power measurements, this spectrum is the power spectrum of the<br>
signal multiplied by the power spectrum of the chosen weighting filter. In the case of a<br>
psychoacoustic model, this spectrum may be a non-linear function of the power within a<br>
series of consecutive critical bands. As mentioned before, such objective measures of<br>
loudness have been found to provide reduced performance for audio signals possessing a<br>
spectrum previously described as "narrowband".<br>
Rather than viewing such signals as narrowband, the inventor has developed a<br>
simpler and more intuitive explanation based on the premise that such signals are<br>
dissimilar to the average spectral shape of ordinary sounds. It may be argued that most<br>
sounds encountered in everyday life, particularly speech, possess a spectral shape that<br>
does not diverge too significantly from an average "expected" spectral shape. This<br>
average spectral shape exhibits a general decrease in energy with increasing frequency<br>
that is band-passed between the lowest and highest audible frequencies. When one<br>
assesses the loudness of a sound possessing a spectrum that deviates significantly from<br>
such an average spectral shape, it is the present inventor's hypothesis that one cognitively<br>
"fills in" to a certain degree those areas of the spectrum that lack the expected energy.<br>
The overall impression of loudness is then obtained by integrating across frequency a<br>
modified spectrum that includes a cognitively "filled in" spectral portion rather than the<br>
actual signal spectrum. For example, if one were listening to a piece of music with just a<br>
bass guitar playing, one would generally expect other instruments eventually to join the<br>
bass and fill out the spectrum. Rather than judge the overall loudness of the soloing bass<br>
from its spectrum alone, the present inventor believes that a portion of the overall<br>
perception of loudness is attributed to the missing frequencies that one expects to<br>
accompany the bass. An analogy may be drawn with the well-known "missing<br>
fundamental" effect in psychoacoustics. If one hears a series of harmonically related<br>
tones, but the fundamental frequency of the series is absent, one still perceives the series as<br>
having a pitch corresponding to the frequency of the absent fundamental.<br>
In accordance with aspects of the present invention, the above-hypothesized subjective<br>
phenomenon is integrated into an objective measure of perceived loudness. FIG. 1 depicts an<br>
overview of aspects of the invention as it applies to any of the objective measures already<br>
mentioned (i.e., both weighted power models and psychoacoustic models). As a first step, an<br>
audio signal x may be transformed to a spectral representation X commensurate with the<br>
particular objective loudness measure being used. A fixed reference spectrum Y represents<br>
the hypothetical average expected spectral shape discussed above. This reference spectrum<br>
may be pre-computed, for example, by averaging the spectra of a representative database of<br>
ordinary sounds. As a next step, a reference spectrum Y may be "matched" to the signal<br>
spectrum X to generate a level-set reference spectrum YM. Matching is meant that YM is<br>
generated as a level scaling of Y so that the level of the matched reference spectrum YM is<br>
aligned with X, the alignment being a function of the level difference between X and Y across<br>
frequency. The level alignment may include a minimization of a weighted or unweighted<br>
difference between X and Y across frequency. Such weighting may be defined in any number<br>
of ways but may be chosen so that the portions of the spectrum X that deviate most from the<br>
reference spectrum Y are weighted most heavily. In that way, the most "unusual" portions of<br>
the signal spectrum X are aligned closest to YM . Next a modified signal spectrum Xc is<br>
generated by modifying X to be close to the matched reference spectrum YM according to a<br>
modification criterion. As will be detailed below, this modification may take the form of<br>
simply selecting the maximum of X and YM across frequency, which simulates the cognitive<br>
"filling in" discussed above. Finally, the modified signal spectrum Xc may be processed<br>
according to the selected objective loudness measure (i.e., some type of integration across<br>
frequency) to produce an objective loudness value L.<br>
FIGS. 2A-C and 3A-C depict, respectively, examples of the computation of modified<br>
signal spectra Xc for two different original signal spectra X. In FIG. 2A, the original signal<br>
spectrum X, represented by the solid line, contains the majority of its energy in the bass<br>
frequencies. In comparison to a depicted reference spectrum Y, represented by the dashed<br>
lines, the shape of the signal spectrum X is considered "unusual". In FIG. 2A, the reference<br>
spectrum is initially shown at an arbitrary starting<br>
level (the upper dashed line) in which it is above the signal spectrum X. The reference<br>
spectrum Y may then be scaled down in level to match the signal spectrum X, creating a<br>
matched reference spectrum YM (the lower dashed line). One may note that YM is<br>
matched most closely with the bass frequencies of X, which may be considered the<br>
"unusual" part of the signal spectrum when compared to the reference spectrum. In FIG.<br>
2B, those portions of the signal spectrum X falling below the matched reference spectrum<br>
YM are made equal to YM thereby modeling the cognitive "filling in" process. In FIG.<br>
2C, one sees the result that the modified signal spectrum Xc, represented by the dotted<br>
line, is equal to the maximum of X and YM across frequency. In this case, the application<br>
of the spectral modification has added a significant amount of energy to the original<br>
signal spectrum at the higher frequencies. As a result, the loudness computed from the<br>
modified signal spectrum Xc is larger than what would have been computed from the<br>
original signal spectrum X, which is the desired effect.<br>
In FTGS. 3A-C, the signal spectrum X is similar in shape to the reference spectrum<br>
Y. As a result, a matched reference spectrum YM may fall below the signal spectrum X at<br>
all frequencies and the modified signal spectrum Xc may be equal to original signal<br>
spectrum X. In this example, the modification does not affect the subsequent loudness<br>
measurement in any way. For the majority of signals, their spectra are close enough to<br>
the modified spectrum, as in FIGS. 3A-C, such that no modification is applied and<br>
therefore no change to the loudness computation occurs. Preferably, only "unusual"<br>
spectra, as in FIGS.2A-C, are modified.<br>
In said WO 2004/111994 A2 and US 2007/0092089 applications, Seefeldt et al<br>
disclose, among other things, an objective measure of perceived loudness based on a<br>
psychoacoustic model. The preferred embodiment of the present invention may apply the<br>
described spectral modification to such a psychoacoustic model. The model, without the<br>
modification, is first reviewed, and then the details of the modification's application are<br>
presented.<br>
From an audio signal, x[n], the psychoacoustic model first computes an excitation<br>
signal E[b,t] approximating the distribution of energy along the basilar membrane of the<br>
inner ear at critical band b during time block t. This excitation may be computed from the<br>
Short-time Discrete Fourier Transform (STDFT) of the audio signal as follows<br><br>
where X[k,t] represents the STDFT of x[n] at time block t and bin k, where k is the<br>
frequency bin index in the transform, T[k] represents the frequency response of a filter<br>
simulating the transmission of audio through the outer and middle ear, and Cb[k]<br>
represents the frequency response of the basilar membrane at a location corresponding to<br>
critical band b. FIG. 4 depicts a suitable set of critical band filter responses in which<br>
forty bands are spaced uniformly along the Equivalent Rectangular Bandwidth (ERB)<br>
scale, as defined by Moore and Glasberg (B. C. J. Moore, B. Glasberg, T. Baer, "A Model<br>
for the Prediction of Thresholds, Loudness, and Partial Loudness," Journal of the Audio<br>
Engineering Society, Vol. 45, No. 4, April 1997, pp. 224-240). Each filter shape is<br>
described by a rounded exponential function and the bands are distributed using a spacing<br>
of 1 ERB. Lastly, the smoothing time constant Xb in (1) may be advantageously chosen<br>
proportionate to the integration time of human loudness perception within band b.<br>
Using equal loudness contours, such as those depicted in FIG. 5, the excitation at<br>
each band is transformed into an excitation level that would generate the same loudness at<br>
1 kHz. Specific loudness, a measure of perceptual loudness distributed across frequency<br>
and time, is then computed from the transfonned excitation, EikHz[b,t], through a<br>
compressive non-linearity. One such suitable function to compute the specific loudness<br>
N[bj] is given by:<br><br>
where TQlkHz is the threshold in quiet at 1 kHz and the constants ß and a are chosen to<br>
match to subjective impression of loudness growth for a 1kHz tone. Although a value of<br>
0.24 for ß and a value of 0.045 for a have been found to be suitable, those values are<br>
not critical. Finally, the total loudness, L[t], represented in units of sone, is computed by<br>
summing the specific loudness across bands:<br>
In this psychoacoustic model, there exist two intermediate spectral representations<br>
of the audio prior to the computation of the total loudness: the excitation E[b,(] and the<br>
specific loudness N[b,t]. For the present invention, the spectral modification may be<br>
applied to either, but applying the modification to the excitation rather than the specific<br>
loudness simplifies calculations. This is because the shape of the excitation across<br>
frequency is invariant to the overall level of the audio signal. This is reflected in the<br>
manner in which the spectra retain the same shape at varying levels, as shown in FIGS.<br>
2A-C and 3A-C. Such is not the case with specific loudness due to the nonlinearity in<br>
Eqn. 2. Thus, the examples given herein apply spectral modifications to an excitation<br>
spectral representation.<br>
Proceeding with the application of the spectral modification to the excitation, a<br>
fixed reference excitation Y[b] is assumed to exist. In practice, Y[b] may be created by<br>
averaging the excitations computed from a database of sounds containing a large number<br>
of speech signals. The source of a reference excitation spectrum Y[b] is not critical to the<br>
invention. In applying the modification, it is useful to work with decibel representations<br>
of the signal excitation E[b,t] and the reference excitation Y[b]:<br><br>
As a first step, the decibel reference excitation YdB[b] may be matched to the decibel<br>
signal excitation EclB[b,t) to generate the matched decibel reference excitation YdBM[b],<br>
where YdBM [b] is represented as a scaling (or additive offset when using dB) of the<br>
reference excitation:<br><br>
The matching offset ?M is computed as a function of the difference, A[b], between<br>
EdB[b,t] and YdB[b]: '<br><br>
From this difference excitation, A[b], a weighting, W[b], is computed as the difference<br>
excitation normalized to have a minimum of zero and then raised to a power y :<br><br>
In practice, setting y=2 works well, although this value is not critical and other<br>
weightings or no weighting at all {i.e., y = l) may be employed. The matching offset ?M<br>
is then computed as the weighted average of the difference excitation, A[b], plus a<br>
tolerance offset, ?Tol:<br><br>
The weighting in Eqn. 7, when greater than one, causes those portions of the signal<br>
excitation EdB[b,t] differing the most from the reference excitation YdB[b] to contribute<br>
most to the matching offset ?M . The tolerance offset ?Tol affects the amount of "fill-in"<br>
that occurs when the modification is applied. In practice, setting ?Tol =-12dB works well,<br>
resulting in the majority of audio spectra being left unmodified through the application of<br>
the modification. (In FIGS. 3A-C, it is this negative value of ATol that causes the<br>
matched reference spectrum to fall completely below, rather than commensurate with, the<br>
signal spectrum and therefore result in no adjustment of the signal spectrum.)<br>
Once the matched reference excitation has been computed, the modification is<br>
applied to generate the modified signal excitation by taking the maximum of EclB[b,t]<br>
and YdBM[b] across bands:<br><br>
The decibel representation of the modified excitation is then converted back to a linear<br>
representation:<br><br>
This modified signal excitation Ec[b,t] then replaces the original signal excitation<br>
E[b,t] in the remaining steps of computing loudness according to the psychoacoustic<br>
model (i.e. computing specific loudness and summing specific loudness across bands as<br>
given in Eqns. 2 and 3)<br>
To demonstrate the practical utility of the disclosed invention, FIGS. 6 and 7<br>
depict data showing how the unmodified and modified psychoacoustic models,<br>
respectively, predict the subjectively assessed loudness of a database of audio recordings.<br>
For each test recording in the database, subjects were asked to adjust the volume of the<br>
audio to match the loudness of some fixed reference recording. For each test recording,<br>
the subjects could instantaneously switch back and forth between the test recording and<br>
the reference recording to judge the difference in loudness. For each subject, the final.<br>
adjusted volume gain in dB was stored for each test recording, and these gains were then<br>
averaged across many subjects to generate a subjective loudness measures for each test<br>
recording. Both the unmodified and modified psychoacoustic models were then used to<br>
generate an objective measure of the loudness for each of the recordings in the database,<br>
and these objective measures are compared to the subjective measures in FIGS. 6 and 7.<br>
In both figures, the horizontal axis represents the subjective measure in dB and the<br>
vertical axis represents the objective measure in dB. Each point in the figure represents a<br>
recording in the database, and if the objective measure were to match the subjective<br>
measure perfectly, then each point would fall exactly on the diagonal line.<br>
For the unmodified psychoacoustic model in FIG. 6, one notes that most of the<br>
data points fall near the diagonal line, but a significant number of outliers exist above the<br>
line. Such outliers represent the problem signals discussed earlier, and the unmodified<br>
psychoacoustic model rates them too quiet in comparison to the average subjective rating.<br>
For the entire database, the Average Absolute Error (AAE) between the objective and<br>
subjective measures is 2.12 dB, which is fairly low, but the Maximum Absolute Error<br>
reaches a very high 10.2 dB.<br>
FIG. 7 depicts the same data for the modified psychoacoustic model. Here, the<br>
majority of the data points are left unchanged from those in FIG. 6 except for the outliers<br>
that have been brought in line with the other points clustered around the diagonal. In<br>
comparison to the unmodified psychoacoustic model, the AAE is reduced somewhat to<br>
1.43 dB, and the MAE is reduced significantly to 4dB. The benefit of the disclosed<br>
spectral modification on the previously outlying signals is readily apparent.<br>
Implementation<br>
Although in principle the invention may be practiced either in the analog or digital<br>
domain (or some combination of the two), in practical embodiments of the invention,<br>
audio signals are represented by samples in blocks of data and processing is done in the<br>
digital domain.<br>
The invention may be implemented in hardware or software, or a combination of<br>
both (e.g., programmable logic arrays). Unless otherwise specified, algorithms and<br>
processes included as part of the invention are not inherently related to any particular<br>
computer or other apparatus. In particular, various general-purpose machines may be<br>
used with programs written in accordance with the teachings herein, or it may be more<br>
convenient to construct more specialized apparatus (e.g., integrated circuits) to perform<br>
the required method steps. Thus, the invention may be implemented in one or more<br>
computer programs executing on one or more programmable computer systems each<br>
comprising at least one processor, at least one data storage system (including volatile and<br>
non-volatile memory and/or storage elements), at least one input device or port, and at<br>
least one output device or port. Program code is applied to input data to perform the<br>
functions described herein and generate output information. The output information is<br>
applied to one or more output devices, in known fashion.<br>
Each such program may be implemented in any desired computer language<br>
(including machine, assembly, or high level procedural, logical, or object oriented<br>
programming languages) to communicate with a computer system. In any case, the<br>
language may be a compiled or interpreted language.<br>
Each such computer program is preferably stored on or downloaded to a storage<br>
media or device (e.g., solid state memory or media, or magnetic or optical media)<br>
readable by a general or special purpose programmable computer, for configuring and<br>
operating the computer when the storage media or device is read by the computer system<br>
to perform the procedures described herein. The inventive system may also be considered<br>
to be implemented as a computer-readable storage medium, configured with a computer<br>
program, where the storage medium so configured causes a computer system to operate in<br>
a specific and predefined manner to perform the functions described herein.<br>
A number of embodiments of the invention have been described. Nevertheless, it will be<br>
understood that various modifications may be made without departing from the spirit and<br>
scope of the invention. For example, some of the steps described herein may be order<br>
independent, and thus can be performed in an order different from that described.<br>
CLAIMS<br>
(as amended under Art. 34 PCT)<br>
1. A method for measuring the perceived loudness of an audio signal, comprising<br>

spectrum Ym are not within said tolerance offset ?Tolof each other, the spectral<br>
representation X to generate a modified spectral representation Xc that conforms more<br>
closely to the level-set reference spectrum YM than does the spectral representation X.<br>
2. A method according to claim 1 wherein the level scaling of the reference spectrum<br>
Y is computed as a function of a weighted or unweighted average of the differences between X<br>
and Y across frequency.<br>
3. A method according to claim 2 wherein the level scaling of the reference spectrum<br>
Y is computed as a function of a weighted average of the differences between X and Y across<br>
frequency and wherein the portions of the spectrum X that deviate most from the reference<br>
spectrum Y are weighted more than other portions.<br>
4. A method according to any one of claims 1-3 wherein modifying said spectral<br>
representation X to generate a modified spectral representation Xc when the spectral<br>
representation X and the level-set reference spectrum YM are not within said tolerance offset<br>
?Tol of each other further includes taking the greater one of the level of the spectral<br>
representation of the audio signal and the level-set reference spectral shape.<br>
5. A method according to any one of claims 1-4 wherein the spectral representation of<br>
the audio signal is an excitation signal that approximates the distribution of energy along the<br>
basilar membrane of the inner ear.<br>
6. A method according to any one of claims 1-5 wherein said reference spectrum Y<br>
represents a hypothetical average expected spectral shape.<br>
7. A method according to claim 6 wherein said reference spectrum Y is pre-computed<br>
by averaging the spectra of a representative database of ordinary sounds.<br>
8. A method according to any one of claims 1-7 wherein said reference spectrum Y is<br>
fixed.<br>
9. Apparatus comprising means adapted to perform the steps of the method of any one<br>
of claims 1 through 8.<br>
10. A computer program that when executed by a computer performs the method of<br>
any one of claims 1 through 8.<br>
11. A computer-readable medium storing thereon the computer program of claims 10.<br><br>
The perceived loudness of an audio sig-nal is measured by modifying a spectral representation of an audio signal as a function of a reference spectral shape so that the spectral representation of the audio signal con-forms more closely to the reference spectral shape, and determining the perceived loudness of the modified spec-tral representation of the audio signal.</td>
