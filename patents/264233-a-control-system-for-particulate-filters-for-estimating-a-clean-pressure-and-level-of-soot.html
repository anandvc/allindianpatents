ADAPTIVE LEARNING METHOD FOR CLEAN PARTICULATE FILTER<br>
PRESSURE DROP<br>
FIELD<br>
[0001] The present disclosure relates to methods and systems for<br>
particulate filter regeneration systems.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0002] The statements in this section merely provide background<br>
information related to the present disclosure and may not constitute prior art.<br>
[0003] Diesel engines typically have higher efficiency than gasoline<br>
engines due to an increased compression ratio and a higher energy density of<br>
diesel fuel. A diesel combustion cycle produces particulates that are typically<br>
filtered from diesel exhaust gas by a particulate filter (PF) that is disposed in the<br>
exhaust stream. Over time, the PF becomes full and the trapped diesel<br>
particulates must be removed. During regeneration, the diesel particulates are<br>
burned within the PF. As emission standards increase, it is anticipated that<br>
particulate filters may be used in non-diesel applications as well.<br>
[0004] Conventional methods initiate regeneration based on distance<br>
driven, time since last regeneration, fuel burnt, or predicted soot accumulation.<br>
Newer methods evaluate a pressure drop in the particulate filter to initiate<br>
regeneration. These methods use one or more predetermined tables to predict a<br>
pressure drop. The pressure entries in the predetermined tables are typically<br>
determined from nominal parts. Therefore, variations in the substrate of the<br>
1<br><br>
GM Reference No. GP-308981-PTE-CD<br>
Attorney Docket No. 8540P-000468<br>
particulate filters, variations in sensor properties, and various affects due to ash<br>
accumulation are not accounted for in the tables. This results in reduced<br>
accuracy in the prediction of soot in the filter.<br>
[0005] For example, when there is a low limit part, the methods under<br>
predict the soot loading on the filter resulting in risk to the hardware during<br>
regeneration. When there is a high limit part, the methods over predict the soot<br>
loading on the filter resulting in too frequent regenerations which impacts fuel<br>
economy. The conventional methods also do not take into account variability of<br>
the accumulation based on drive cycle characteristics. Thus, the method has<br>
proven to be unreliable.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
[0006] Accordingly, a control system for particulate filters is provided.<br>
The control system includes a clean filter estimating module that estimates a<br>
clean pressure based on a first pressure in the particulate filter within a<br>
predetermined period of a regeneration event. A soot prediction module<br>
estimates a level of soot in the particulate filter based on a comparison of the first<br>
pressure and a second pressure in the particulate filter received after the<br>
predetermined period.<br>
[0007] In other features, a method of estimating soot levels in a<br>
particulate filter is provided. The method includes: receiving a first pressure in<br>
the particulate filter within a predetermined period of a regeneration event;<br>
estimating a clean pressure based on the first pressure in the particulate filter;<br>
2<br><br>
GM Reference No GP-308981-PTE-CD<br>
Attorney Docket No. 8540P-000468<br>
receiving a second pressure in the particulate filter after the predetermined<br>
period of the regeneration event; and estimating a level of soot in the particulate<br>
filter based on a comparison of the first pressure and the second pressure.<br>
[0008] Further areas of applicability will become apparent from the<br>
description provided herein. It should be understood that the description and<br>
specific examples are intended for purposes of illustration only and are not<br>
intended to limit the scope of the present disclosure.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0014] The following description is merely exemplary in nature and is<br>
not intended to limit the present disclosure, application, or uses. It should be<br>
3<br><br>
GM Reference No. GP-308981-PTE-CD<br>
Attorney Docket No. 8540P-000468<br>
understood that throughout the drawings, corresponding reference numerals<br>
indicate like or corresponding parts and features. As used herein, the term<br>
module refers to an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), an electronic<br>
circuit, a processor (shared, dedicated, or group) and memory that executes one<br>
or more software or firmware programs, a combinational logic circuit, and/or<br>
other suitable components that provide the described functionality.<br>
[0015] Referring now to Figure 1, an exemplary diesel engine system<br>
10 is schematically illustrated in accordance with the present invention. It is<br>
appreciated that the diesel engine system 10 is merely exemplary in nature and<br>
that the adaptive pressure drop measurement system described herein can be<br>
implemented in various engine systems implementing a particulate filter. Such<br>
engine systems may include, but are not limited to, gasoline direct injection<br>
engine systems and homogeneous charge compression ignition engine systems.<br>
For ease of the discussion, the remainder of the disclosure will be discussed in<br>
the context of a diesel engine system.<br>
[0016] A turbocharged diesel engine system 10 includes an engine 12<br>
that combusts an air and fuel mixture to produce drive torque. Air enters the<br>
system by passing through an air filter 14. Air passes through the air filter 14 and<br>
is drawn into a turbocharger 18. The turbocharger 18 compresses the fresh air<br>
entering the system 10. The greater the compression of the air generally, the<br>
greater the output of the engine 12. Compressed air then passes through an air<br>
cooler 20 before entering into an intake manifold 22.<br>
4<br><br>
GM Reference No. GP-308981-PTE-CD<br>
Attorney Docket No. 8540P-000468<br>
[0017] Air within the intake manifold 22 is distributed into cylinders 26.<br>
Although four cylinders 26 are illustrated, it is appreciated that the systems and<br>
methods of the present invention can be implemented in engines having a<br>
plurality of cylinders including, but not limited to, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10 and 12<br>
cylinders. It is also appreciated that the systems and methods of the present<br>
invention can be implemented in a v-type cylinder configuration. Fuel is injected<br>
into the cylinders 26 by fuel injectors 28. Heat from the compressed air ignites<br>
the air/fuel mixture. Combustion of the air/fuel mixture creates exhaust. Exhaust<br>
exits the cylinders 26 into the exhaust system.<br>
[0018] The exhaust system includes an exhaust manifold 30, a diesel<br>
oxidation catalyst (DOC) 32, and a particulate filter (PF) 34. Optionally, an EGR<br>
valve (not shown) re-circulates a portion of the exhaust back into the intake<br>
manifold 22. The remainder of the exhaust is directed into the turbocharger 18 to<br>
drive a turbine. The turbine facilitates the compression of the fresh air received<br>
from the air filter 14. Exhaust flows from the turbocharger 18 through the DOC<br>
32 and the PF 34. The DOC 32 oxidizes the exhaust based on the post<br>
combustion air/fuel ratio. The amount of oxidation increases the temperature of<br>
the exhaust. The PF 34 receives exhaust from the DOC 32 and filters any soot<br>
particulates present in the exhaust.<br>
[0019] A control module 44 controls the engine and PF regeneration<br>
based on various sensed information. A first pressure sensor senses a<br>
differential in pressure of exhaust gases flowing through the PF and generates a<br>
first pressure sensor signal accordingly. As can be appreciated, other sensors<br>
5<br><br>
GM Reference No. GP-308981-PTE-CD<br>
Attorney Docket No. 8540P-000468<br>
and methods may be employed to sense or determine a pressure differential in<br>
the PF 34. The control module 44 receives the pressure sensor signal and<br>
determines a PF pressure drop based on drop measurement methods and<br>
systems as will be discussed further below. The control module 44 thereafter<br>
estimates loading of the PF 34 based on the pressure drop. When the estimated<br>
loading achieves a threshold level (e.g., 5 grams/liter of particulate matter) and<br>
the exhaust flow rate is within a desired range, the regeneration process is<br>
initiated. The duration of the regeneration process varies based upon the<br>
amount of particulate matter determined to be within the PF 34.<br>
[0020] With particular reference to Figure 2, an exemplary PF 34 is<br>
shown. The exemplary PF 34 is a monolith particulate trap and includes<br>
alternating closed cells/channels 50 and opened cells/channels 52. The<br>
cells/channels 50,52 are typically square cross-sections, running axially through<br>
the part. Walls 58 of the PF 34 are preferably comprised of a porous ceramic<br>
honeycomb wall of cordierite material. It is appreciated that any ceramic comb<br>
material is considered within the scope of the present invention. Adjacent<br>
channels are alternatively plugged at each end as shown at 56. This forces the<br>
diesel aerosol through the porous substrate walls which act as a mechanical<br>
filter. Particulate matter is deposited within the closed channels 50 and exhaust<br>
exits through the opened channels 52. Soot particles 59 flow into the PF 34 and<br>
are trapped therein. An accumulation of the soot particles impacts the pressure<br>
drop in the PF 34.<br>
6<br><br>
GM Reference No. GP-308981-PTE-CD<br>
Attorney Docket No 8540P-000468<br>
[0021] With reference to Figure 3, a dataflow diagram illustrates<br>
various embodiments of an adaptive pressure drop measurement system that<br>
may be embedded within the control module 44. Various embodiments of<br>
adaptive pressure drop measurement systems according to the present<br>
disclosure may include any number of sub-modules embedded within the control<br>
module 44. The sub-modules shown may be combined and/or further partitioned<br>
to similarly measure a pressure drop of the PF 34. Inputs to the system may be<br>
sensed from the system 10 (Figure 1), received from other control modules (not<br>
shown) within the system 10 (Figure 1), and/or determined by other sub-modules<br>
(not shown) within the control module 44. In various embodiments, the control<br>
module 44 of Figure 3 includes a clean filter estimating module 70, an adaptive<br>
learn module 72, and a soot prediction module 74.<br>
[0022] The clean filter estimating module 70 monitors regeneration<br>
event conditions to determine when the PF 34 is clean and sets an enable status<br>
flag 76 accordingly. In various embodiments, the clean filter estimating module<br>
70 monitors a regeneration time 80, a regeneration temperature 82, and a<br>
regeneration complete status indicator 78 to ensure that regeneration has<br>
completed and that the PF 34 is clean. For example, if the regeneration status<br>
indicator 78 indicates that regeneration is complete, the regeneration time 80<br>
indicates that regeneration occurred for a predetermined time, and the<br>
regeneration temperature 82 indicates that the PF temperature was equal to or<br>
above a predetermined temperature threshold during regeneration, the PF 34 is<br>
7<br><br>
GM Reference No. GP-308981-PTE-CD<br>
Attorney Docket No. 8540P-000468<br>
deemed clean and the enable status flag 76 is set to TRUE. Otherwise, the<br>
enable status flag 76 remains set to FALSE.<br>
[0023] As can be appreciated, the clean filter estimating module 70<br>
may also monitor engine system enable conditions to determine an appropriate<br>
time to perform an adaptive learn once the PF 34 is clean. Such engine system<br>
enable conditions can include, but are not limited to, speed 84 and load 86. For<br>
example, if the speed 84 and load 86 conditions are within predetermined ranges<br>
respectively, the enable status flag 76 is set to TRUE. Otherwise, the enable<br>
status flag 76 remains set to FALSE.<br>
[0024] The adaptive learn module 72, once enabled via the enable<br>
status flag 76, adaptively learns pressure drop values 88 and stores the values in<br>
memory 90 for later use. In various embodiments, a pressure drop value 91 for a<br>
given flow rate 92 and PF temperature 94 is measured once the PF 34 is clean.<br>
The measured pressure drop 91 is then stored as clean filter pressure drop 85 in<br>
a two-dimensional clean pressure drop table accessed by PF temperature 94<br>
and volume flow rate 92. The soot prediction module 74 estimates a level of soot<br>
96 in the PF 34 based on a total measured pressure of the PF 98, values 88 from<br>
the clean filter pressure table, a PF temperature 94, and a volume flow rate 92.<br>
More particularly, the soot prediction module 74 measures at total pressure drop<br>
98 across the PF 34; and retrieves a clean pressure drop 88 from the clean filter<br>
table based on PF temperature 94 and volume flow rate 92. Based on the total<br>
pressure drop (TP) 98, the clean pressure drop (CP) 88, and the flow rate 92, the<br>
8<br><br>
GM Reference No. GP-308981-PTE-CD<br>
Attorney Docket No. 8540P-000468<br>
soot prediction module 74 computes a resistance flow rate (RF) as shown by the<br>
following equation:<br>
RF = (TP-CP)/FR	(1)<br>
The soot prediction module 74 then uses the computed resistance flow to<br>
determine a soot accumulation level 96. In various embodiments, a soot<br>
accumulation level 96 is estimated based on a two-dimensional lookup table<br>
defined by the volume flow rate 92 and the resistance flow.<br>
[0025] With reference to Figure 4, a process flow diagram illustrates<br>
various embodiments of an adaptive pressure drop measurement method that<br>
may be performed by the control module 44 of Figure 3. As can be appreciated,<br>
the method may be run periodically during engine operation. The method begins<br>
at 100. At 110, regeneration complete enable conditions are evaluated. If the<br>
regeneration complete enable conditions are TRUE at 110, engine system<br>
operating conditions are evaluated at 120. Otherwise, control loops back and<br>
continues to monitor regeneration complete enable conditions at 110. If the<br>
engine system operating conditions are TRUE at 120, the clean filter pressure<br>
drop is measured and stored in memory at 130. Otherwise, control loops back<br>
and continues to monitor engine system enable conditions at 120. As can be<br>
appreciated, if control continues to monitor engine system enable conditions for<br>
too long after the regeneration is complete at 130, so as too accumulate soot in<br>
the PF, control proceeds to the end. Otherwise, once the clean filter pressure<br>
drop is measured and stored in memory at 130 and 140 respectively, control<br>
estimates the soot accumulation in the PF at 150 based on a resistance flow rate<br>
9<br><br>
GM Reference No. GP-308981-PTE-CD<br>
Attorney Docket No. 8540P-000468<br>
and a volume flow rate as discussed above. As can be appreciated, the soot<br>
estimation at 150 can be performed at various times during engine operation and<br>
is not limited to the sequential execution as shown in Figure 4.<br>
[0026] Those skilled in the art can now appreciate from the foregoing<br>
description that the broad teachings of the present disclosure can be<br>
implemented in a variety of forms. Therefore, while this disclosure has been<br>
described in connection with particular examples thereof, the true scope of the<br>
disclosure should not be so limited since other modifications will become<br>
