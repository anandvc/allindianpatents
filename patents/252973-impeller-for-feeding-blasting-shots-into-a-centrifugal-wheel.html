Impeller f ?r reading blasting shots into a centrifugal wheel<br>
Description<br>
The invention relates to an impeller for feeding blasting shots, which are to be accelerated, into the centrifugal wheel of a blasting installation, the impeller being arranged in the central region of the centrifugal wheel inside a distributing sleeve which has a distributing opening and can be rotated in the direction of rotation of the centrifugal wheel, and the impeller having, in particular platelike, guiding elements which are directed toward the distributing sleeve, are intended for guiding the.blasting shot to the outside and are arranged on at least one lateral disk.<br>
3iasting installations equipped with centrifugal wheels are used to free surfaces of metallic rolled products from scale and/or rust before the surface obtains a protective coating of paint by a blasting shot comprising fine metal particles being hurled against the 3urfa_e. In a centrifugal wheel of this type, not all of th-3 parti ties of the blasting shot move outward preferabl/ targentially and as parallel as possible to the blade = of the rotating centrifugal wheel when they emerge from the distributing opening of the distributing sleeve. A considerable number of these particles strikes against the lateral disks and the blades and rebounds therefrom, in a manner comparable to a ping-pong tali, which not only has a negative effect in the exit speed of the blasting shot from the centrifugal wheel but also leads to the blasting shot being ncnuniforrr.iy distributed over the surface to be cleaned, The impacting of the blasting shot particles<br><br>
against the parts of the centrifugal wheel also causes the same ;: be subject tc a high degree of wear.<br>
It is the object of the invention to reduce the degree of wear caused to the centrifugal wheel by the blasting shoo and at the same time to produce a blasting pattern uniformly covering one entire ejection angle of the blasting shot from the centrifugal wheel with approximately parallel lateral delimitation.<br>
According to the inventionr this object is achieved, starting from an impeller for feeding in blasting shots of the type described at -he beginning in that in each case at least two adjacent guiding means are designed as limbs, interconnected, in particular, integrally, of a profiled piece, adjacent limbs of adjacent profiled pieces forcing channels through which the blasting shot can be discharged to the outside.<br>
The limbs of the profiled piece expediently point, on . the one hand, in the direction of the distributing sleeve and, on the other hand, at least approximately in the direction of the axis of rotation of the impeller.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, those limb ends of the profiled piece which are directed toward the distributing sleeve ^re spaced apart from one another in the circumferential direction of the impeller, in particular of the lateral disk, with a recess which is accessible from the direction of the distributing sleeve being arranged between the limbs, in particular a cavity into which the blasting shot can penetrate or escape. the recess or the cavity can be formed directly by the limbs ,<br>
As far as the spatial orientation of the two limbs of the profiled piece is concerned, they preferably run at an angle tc each other, in particular at least in an<br><br>
approximately V-shaped manner cr the two limbs form a V shape. At least one limb, preferably both limbs of the profiled piece, can preferably run at an angle to the ra.ti.iai direction of the impeller, in particular of the lateral disk.<br>
In a further embodiment, the limbs of the profiled pieces can be interconnected by a web preferably running at an angle to the limbs. The web can run, for example, in a rectilinear or curved manner. It is furthermore possible for the limbs of the profiled pieces t: be designed such that they differ in length. It has *isc proven successful between the limbs of the profiled pieces to provide preferably platelike transporting elements extending in the direction of the distributive s 1 ee ve .<br>
The following is achieved by the configuration according tc the invention of the guiding elements as limbs of profiled pieces: first of all, the blasting shot enters fro- the rotating impeller via the discharging channels with discharging openings at the channel ends into the spaces between distributing sleeve and impeller on an approximately circular path. Subsequently, the blasting shot revolves in this region between distributing sleeve and impeller along this circular path. The forces which act on the blasting shot fro:; the, m particular, free limbs of the profiled pieces and, if appropriate, from the transporting elements between the limbs of the profiled pieces cause the blasting shot finally to be transferred as tangentially as possible from the distributing opening of the distributing sleeve into the operative region of the blades of the centrifugal wheel. "his results in a soft transition of the blasting shot into the blade region of the centrifugal wheel :•■■=: the entire width with subsequent uniform acceleration as far as the exit from the blade. The blasting shot is substantially prevented from impacting<br><br>
against the blades and lateral walls of the centrifugal wheel.<br>
The impact-f ree transition of the blasting shot from the impeller, which =cts as a central accelerator, into the centrifugal wheel brings about a uniform guidance of the blasting shot in -he centrifugal wheel, thus not only obtaining a uniform distribution of the blasting shot over the surface to be treated but also reducing the degree of wear at the centrifugal wheel and the energy tv be expended in order to accelerate the blasting shot.<br>
An exemplary embodiment of the present invention is described with reference to the attached drawing, in which:<br>
Fig, 1 snows a diagrammatic sectional view of an impeller according to the invention.<br>
Fig. 1 shows, in a schematic sectional view, an impeller 1 which is arranged in the interior of a distributing sleeve 1 of a centrifugal wheel of a blasting installation (not illustrated) *<br>
The impeller 2 has profiled pieces 3 which are fastened to one of the end sides of a first lateral disk 4. A second lateral disk (not illustrated) is assigned to the first lateral iisk (4) lying opposite it in the axial direction, so that the profiled pieces 3 are arranged cetweer. the two lateral disks, It is pointed out thai., within the scope of the invention, the profiled pieces 3, in principle, may also be connected integrally to the end side of the lateral disk 4. The profiled pieces 3 are raised in relation to the end*sice ilane of the lateral disk 4, i.e. they form elevations with respect to this plane.<br><br>
The individual profiled pieces are distributed in the circumferential direction over the encircling edge region of ohe end side of the lateral disk 4. In this case, each profiled piece 3 is spaced apart in the circumferential direction from the respectively adjacent profiled piece 3. The profiled pieces. 3 each have two limbs 5 and 6 which serve as blasting-shot guiding elements and are interconnected at their ends directed at lease approximately to the center of the impeller :r to the axis of rotation of the impeller. The limbs 5 and t point with their free ends at the distributing sleeve 1, with cavities which are accessible from the direction of the distributing sleeve being formed in each case between the limbs 5 and 6. The or of lied oieces 3 are distributed in the circumferential direction over the encircling edge region of the end side of the lateral disk 4 in such a manner that channels 7 are formed between adjacent limbs of adjacent profiled pieces 3.<br>
As far as the limbs 5 and 6 of a profiled piece 3 are concerned, they may describe a V shape, as shown in a sector A of the impeller 2. In another embodiment, the limbs 5 and 6 may also be interconnected via a web 9, of. sector 5, so that the profiled piece 3 is designed overall approximately as a U shape. As a person skilled in the art will recognize, diverse shapes are conceivable here,- such as, for example, also an L shaoe.<br>
The distributing sleeve 1, which is otherwise closed, is provided or. the circumference with a discharging opening 5.<br>
During ope rail on of the blasting installation, blasting shot is guided via supply lines (not illustrated) in the axial iireotion into the center of the impeller 2. The blasting is subsequently guided radially outward from the impeller 2, which is offset into a rotational<br><br>
movement via  a drive  (not illustrated),  along	the<br>
channels ~ . The blasting shot is finally output via	the<br>
discharging opening £ into the angular region of	the<br>
blades of 5 centrifugal wheel (non shown)-<br><br>
