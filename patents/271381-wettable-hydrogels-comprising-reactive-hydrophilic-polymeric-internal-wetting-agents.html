In another example, reactive, hydrophilic polymeric IWAs can be made by<br>
initiating the polymerization of a monomer (such as, for example, DMA) with a<br>
5	lesser molar amount of an aroine-functionalized azo initiator (such as, for example,<br>
2,2'-Azobis(2-mcthylpropionamide)dihydrochloride) and then reacting the amine<br>
groups of the resulting low molecular weight polymers with materials containing<br>
free radical polymerizable groups, such as 2-isocyanatoethyl methaerylate, 3-<br>
isopropenyl-alpha, alpha-dimcthylbenzyl isocyanate, methacrylic anhydride, acrylic<br>
10	acid, methacrylic acid, acryloyl chloride, or methacryloyl chloride. Examples of the<br>
above compounds include low molecular weight hydrophilic polymers of Formulae<br>
III and reactive, hydrophilic polymeric IWAs of Formulae IV.<br><br>
WO 2006/039466	PCT/US2005/035149<br><br>
In yet a further example, reactive, hydrophilic polymeric IWAs can also be<br>
5	made by initiating the polymerization of a monomer (such as, for example, DMA)<br>
with a lesser molar amount of a carboxylic acid-functionalized azo initiator (such as,<br>
for example, 2,2'-Azobis[N-(2-carboxyethyl)-2-methylpropionamidine]tetrahydrate)<br>
and then reacting the carboxylic acid groups of the resulting low molecular weight<br>
hydrophilic polymer with materials containing free radical polymcrizable groups,<br>
10	such as, for example, 2-arninoethyl methacrylate or 3-aminopropyl methacrylamide.<br>
A person skilled in the art will recognize that incomplete reaction between<br>
the low molecular weight hydrophilic polymer and the free radical polymerizable<br><br><br>

compound results in a mixture of products which include, in part, the starting low<br>
molecular weight hydrophilic polymer, the reactive hydrophilic polymeric IWA, and<br>
unreacted free radical polymerizable compounds. If low molecular weight<br>
hydrophilic polymer is present in the final product mixture, it is not essential to<br>
5	remove it from the product mixture. Instead, the low molecular weight hydrophilic<br>
polymer may remain, serve as a diluent in the contact lens formulation and be<br>
removed later during the purification of the lenses. Those of skill in the art will also<br>
recognize that molecular weights of the reactive, hydrophilic polymeric IWAs will<br>
vary depending on the reaction parameters, such as amount of initiator present,<br>
10	reaction temperature, and monomer concentration. In addition, the presence of chain<br>
transfer agents such thioglycolic acid and thiolactic acid can also be used to control<br>
the molecular weights of the reactive, hydrophilic polymeric IWAs.<br>
Examples of the above compounds include low molecular weight<br>
hydrophilic polymers of Formulae V and reactive, hydrophilic polymeric internal<br>
15	wetting agents of Formulae VI and VII.<br><br>

water soluble at processing temperatures are preferred.<br>
In addition to the reactive, hydrophilic polymeric IWAs, the hydrogels of the<br>
present invention further comprise one or more silicone-contaimng components and,<br>
5	optionally one or more hydrophilic components. The silicone-containing and<br>
hydrophilic components used to make the polymer of this invention can be any of<br>
the known components used in the prior art to make siliconc hydrogels. These terms<br>
silicone-containing component and hydrophilic component are not mutually<br>
exclusive, in that, the silicone-containing component can be somewhat hydrophilic<br>
10	and the hydrophilic component can comprise some silicone, because the silicone-<br>
containing component can have hydrophilic groups and the hydrophilic components<br>
can have siliconc groups.<br>
Further, silicone-containing componcnt(s) and hydrophilic components) can<br>
be reacted prior to polymerization to form a prepolyrner which is later polymerized<br>
15	in the presence of a diluent to form the polymer of this invention. When<br>
prepolymers or macromers are used, it is preferred to polymerize at least one<br>
silicone-containing monomer and at least one hydrophilic monomer in the presence<br>
of the diluent, wherein the silicone-containing monomers and the hydrophilic<br>
monomers differ. The term "monomer" used herein refers to low molecular weight<br>
20	compounds (i.e. typically having number average molecular weights less than 700)<br>
that can be polymerized.  Thus, it is understood that the terms "silicone-containing<br>
components" and "hydrophilic components" include monomers, macromonomers<br>
and prepolymers.<br>
A silicone-containing component is one thai contains at least one [—Si—O—<br>
25	Si] group, in a monomer, rnacromer or prepolymer. Preferably, the Si and attached O<br>
are present in the silicone-containing component in an amount greater than 20 weight<br>
percent, and more preferably greater than 30 weight percent of the total molecular<br>
weight of the silicone-containing component.   Useful silicone-contaimng components<br><br>

The reaction mixtures of the present invention can be formed by any of the<br>
methods know to those skilled in the art, such as shaking or stirring, and used to<br>
form polymeric articles or devices by known methods.<br>
For example, the biomedical devices of the invention may be prepared by<br>
10	mixing reactive components and the diluent(s) with a polymerization initator and<br>
curing by appropriate conditions to form a product that can be subsequently formed<br>
into the appropriate shape by lathing, cutting and the like. Alternatively, the<br>
reaction mixture may be placed in a mold and subsequently cured into the<br>
appropriate article.<br>
15	Various processes are known for processing the reaction mixture in the<br>
production of contact lenses, including spincasting and static casting. Spincasting<br>
methods are disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,408,429 and 3,660,545, and static casting<br>
methods are disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,113,224 and 4,197,266. The preferred<br>
method for producing contact lenses comprising the polymer of this invention is by<br>
20	the molding of the silicone hydrogels, which is economical, and enables precise<br>
control over the final shape of the hydrated lens. For this method, the reaction<br>
mixture is placed in a mold having the shape of the final desired silicone hydrogel,<br>
i.e., water-swollen polymer, and the reaction mixture is subjected to conditions<br>
whereby the monomers polymerize, to thereby produce a polymer/diluent mixture in<br>
25	the shape of the final desired product. Then, this polymer/diluent mixture is treated<br>
with a solvent to remove the diluent and ultimately replace it with water, producing<br>
a silicone hydrogel having a final size and shape which are quite similar to the size<br>
and shape of the original molded polymer/diluent article. This method can be used<br><br>

The biomedical devices, and particularly ophthalmic lenses of the present<br>
invention have a balance of properties which makes them particularly useful. Such<br>
5	properties include clarity, water content, oxygen permeability and contact angle.<br>
Thus, in one embodiment, the biomedical devices are contact lenses having a water<br>
content of greater than about 17%, preferably greater than about 20% and more<br>
preferably greater than about 25%.<br>
As used herein clarity means substantially free from visible haze. Preferably<br>
10	clear lenses have a haze value of less than about 150%, more preferably less than<br>
about 100%.<br>
Suitable oxygen permeabilities are preferably greater than about 40 barrer<br>
and more preferably greater than about 60 barrer.<br>
Also, the biomedical devices, and particularly ophthalmic devices and<br>
15	contact lenses have contact angles (advancing) which are less than about 80°,<br>
preferably less than about 70° and more preferably less than about 65°. In some<br>
preferred embodiments the articles of the present invention have combinations of the<br>
above described oxygen permeability, water content and contact angle. All<br>
combinations of the above ranges are deemed to be within the present invention.<br>
20	The non-limiting examples below further describe this invention.<br>
The dynamic contact angle or DCA, was measured at 23°C, with borate<br>
buffered saline, using a Wilhelmy balance. The wetting force between the lens<br>
surface and borate buffered saline is measured using a Wilhelmy microbalance while<br>
the sample strip cut from the center portion of the lens is being immersed into the<br>
25	saline at a rate of 100 microns/sec . The following equation is used<br>
F = 2γpcosθ	or       θ = cos-1(F/2γp)<br>
where F is the wetting force, γ is the surface tension of the probe liquid, p is the<br>
perimeter of the sample at the meniscus and 0 is the contact angle. Typically, two<br><br>

contact angles are obtained from a dynamic wetting experiment - advancing contact<br>
angle and receding contact angle. Advancing contact angle is obtained from the<br>
portion of the wetting experiment where the sample is being immersed into the<br>
probe liquid, and these are the values reported herein. At least four lenses of each<br>
5	composition are measured and the average is reported.<br>
The water content was measured as follows: lenses to be tested were allowed<br>
to sit in packing solution for 24 hours. Each of three test lens were removed from<br>
packing solution using a sponge tipped swab and placed on blotting wipes which<br>
have been dampened with packing solution. Both sides of the lens were contacted<br>
10	with the wipe. Using tweezers, the test lens were placed in a weighing pan and<br>
weighed. The two more sets of samples were prepared and weighed as above. The<br>
pan was weighed three times and the average is the wet weight.<br>
The dry weight was measured by placing the sample pans in a vacuum<br>
oven which has been preheated to 60°C for 30 minutes. Vacuum was applied until<br>
15	at least 0.4 inches Hg is attained. The vacuum valve and pump were turned off and<br>
the lenses were dried for four hours. The purge valve was opened and the oven was<br>
allowed reach atmospheric pressure. The pans were removed and weighed. The<br>
water content was calculated as follows:<br>
20	Wet weight = combined wet weight of pan and lenses - weight of weighing pan<br>
Dry weight = combined dry weight of pan and lens - weight of weighing pan<br>
% water content = (wet weight - dry weights x 100<br>
                                       wet weight<br>
25	The average and standard deviation of the water content are calculated for the<br>
samples are reported.<br>
Modulus was measured by using the crosshead of a constant rate of<br>
movement type tensile testing machine equipped with a load cell that is lowered to<br>
the initial gauge height. A suitable testing machine includes an Instron model 1122.<br>

0.213 inch "neck" width was loaded into the grips and elongated at a constant rate of<br>
strain of 2 in/min. until it broke. The initial gauge length of the sample (Lo) and<br>
sample length at break (Lf) were measured. Twelve specimens of each composition<br>
were measured and the average is reported. Tensile modulus was measured at the<br>
5	initial linear portion of the stress/strain curve.<br>
Haze is measured by placing a hydrated test lens in borate buffered saline in<br>
a clear 20 x 40 x 10 mm glass cell at ambient temperature above a flat black<br>
background, illuminating from below with a fiber optic lamp (Titan Tool Supply Co.<br>
fiber optic light with 0.5" diameter light guide set at a power setting of 4-5.4) at an<br>
10	angle 66° normal to the lens cell, and capturing an image of the lens from above,<br>
normal to the lens cell with a video camera (DVC 1300C: 19130 RGB camera with<br>
Navitar TV Zoom 7000 zoom lens) placed 14 mm above the lens platform. The<br>
background scatter is subtracted from the scatter of the lens by subtracting an image<br>
of a blank cell using EPIX XCAP V 1.0 software. The subtracted scattered light<br>
15	image is quantitatively analyzed, by integrating over the central 10 mm of the lens,<br>
and then comparing to a -1.00 diopter CSI Thin Lens®, which is arbitrarily set at a<br>
haze value of 100, with no lens set as a haze value of 0. Five lenses are analyzed<br>
and the results are averaged to generate a haze value as a percentage of the standard<br>
CSI lens.<br>
20	Oxygen permeability (Dk) may be determined by the polarographic method<br>
generally described in ISO 9913-1: 1996(E), but with the following variations. The<br>
measurement is conducted at an environment containing 2.1% oxygen. This<br>
environment is created by equipping the test chamber with nitrogen and air inputs<br>
set at the appropriate ratio, for example 1800 ml/min of nitrogen and 200 ml/min of<br>
25	air. The t/Dk is calculated using the adjusted po2- Borate buffered saline was used.<br>
The dark current was measured by using a pure humidified nitrogen environment<br>
instead of applying MMA lenses. The lenses were not blotted before measuring.<br>
Four lenses were stacked instead of using lenses of varied thickness. A curved<br><br>

The reactive, hydrophilic polymeric IWAs (RHPIWA) were synthesized in<br>
the presence of small amounts (~ 1 mol percent) of fluorescent vinyl monomers.<br>
5	Covalently attached fluorescent "probes", or fluorophores, were used to detect the<br>
diffusion of unreacted monomers from the production of the reactive, hydrophilic<br>
polymeric IWAs from the contact lenses. The concentration of fluorescent probe in<br>
the RHPIWA is low enough so that the physical properties of the labeled RHPIWA<br>
are similar to that of unlabeled RHPIWA.<br>
10	The fluorescent probes and fluorescently labeled macromers were first tested<br>
to determine whether conditions necessary to make lenses, such as for example, light<br>
intensity and heat, affect the emission of fluorescence of the fluorophore. The<br>
resultant fluorescently labeled macromers were then combined with reactive<br>
components and diluents to make contact lenses. The release of PVP macromers<br>

standards was used to correlate the amount of PVP macromer release from lenses.<br>

The results of Examples 7A through 7F show that the reaction mixture<br>

The reactive, hydrophilic polymeric internal wetting agents in Examples 7C<br>
through 7F) were comparable or lower in molecular weight than the low molecular<br>
weight hydrophilic polymer of Example 2 (used in formulation 7B) having no<br>
photo-polymerizable groups. The percent release of the reactive, hydrophilic<br>
10	polymeric IWAs (Examples 7C-F) from contact lenses was lower (5-35%) as<br>
compared to polymers without photo-polymerizable groups (Example 7B, 50%).<br>
Example 7A used a non-reactive high molecular weight hydrophilic copolymers.<br>
Figure 1 shows the percent of internal wetting agent loss in IPA as a function of<br>
time. Example 7D, which comprises a reactive, hydrophilic polymeric IWA lost less<br>
15	than about 5% of the IWA, while Example 7A (which contained a non-reactive<br>
hydrophilic, polymeric IWA) lost about 12% of the IWA. Based on Example 4,<br>
comparable and even slower release rates can be achieved using lower molecular<br>
hydrophilic polymeric IWAs with photo-polymerizable end group(s).<br>
The Examples also show that reactive, hydrophilic polymeric IWAs may be<br>
20	synthesized using several synthetic routes, and resulting in resulting in reactive,<br><br>

hydrophilic polymeric IWAs with different structures, particularly at the end groups.<br>
The lenses from Example 7F were analyzed to determine contact angle,<br>

The results of Examples 17A through F show that the reaction mixture<br>
5	components and their amounts may be varied. All lenses showed low haze.<br>
As shown in Table 5, the rate of release of the polymers without reactive<br>
groups (Examples 17C and 17E) was faster than that of the high molecular weight<br>
control (Example 17A) and slower than that of the low molecular weight control<br>
(Example 17B) after ~100 hours in isopropanol. Examples 17D and 17F, which<br>
10	contained reactive, hydrophilic polymeric IWAs of the present invention, displayed<br><br>
WO 2006/039466	PCT/US2005/035149<br>

insignificant release of the internal wetting agents. This is significant since<br>
preservation of the internal wetting agent helps maintain lens wettability in addition<br>
to other previously described lens properties since the initial weight percent of<br>
components in the reaction mixture remains relatively constant after curing and<br>
5	extraction in organic solvents.<br>
Example 18<br>
Synthesis was carried out as in Example 13 without the use of 9-<br>
vinylcarbazole. In addition, methyl alcohol in the reaction mixture was replaced by<br>
10	an equal weight of distilled water. Polymer Mn, Mw, and polydispersity was:<br>
45,000,225,000, and 5.0.<br>
Example 19<br>
Synthesis was carried out as in Example 14 without the use of 9-<br>
15	vinylcarbazole. In addition, methyl alcohol in the reaction mixture was replaced by<br>
an equal weight of distilled water. Polymer Mn, Mw, and polydispersity were:<br>
49,000,230,000, and 4.7.<br>
Examples 20<br>
20	Lenses containing the low molecular weight hydrophilic polymer of Example<br>
18 and the reactive, hydrophilic polymer IWA of Example 19 were made as in<br>
Example 17 using similar amounts of reaction components, but without the addition<br>
of fluorophore. The cure intensity, temperature, and time were similarly held at 4.0<br>
mW/cm2, 55°C, and 12 minutes, respectively. Low haze was observed in all lenses.<br>
