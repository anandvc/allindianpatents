The present invention relates to deflecting equipment for deflecting a strip, in particular a metal strip.<br>
The invention also relates to a deflection method for a strip, in particular, a metal strip, from an initial guide channel into a final guide channel which runs next to the initial guide channel, wherein the strip, when passing through the initial guide channel, has an upper side facing the final guide channel and an underside facing away from the final guide channel, as well as a deflection device corresponding thereto.<br>
When continuously winding strips, in particular, metal strips, the leading end of a following strip must be guided to a different hasp than the end of the preceding strip. The strip must therefore be guided from an initial guide channel into a final guide channel. Whether for the next strip change a change back to the initial guide channel takes place, as is the case for a multi-hasp device, or whether a change from the initial guide channel into the final guide channel must again be performed, as in the case of a rotor or reversing hasp, is of no consequence within the context of the present invention.<br>
The known deflection devices operate substantially satisfactorily but could still be improved upon.<br><br>
The object of the present invention resides in that the prior art deflection methods or the prior art deflection devices are to be improved.<br>
The object is solved for the method in accordance with claim l in that the strip upon deflection to the next hasp is loaded with a medium on the underside.<br>
In correspondence thereto, the deflection device has a lower loading device for loading the underside of the strip with a medium.<br>
The medium can be, for example, compressed air or water that is under pressure.<br>
When the deflection device comprises a drive device with an upper drive roll and a lower drive roll, wherein the upper drive roll acts on the upper side and the lower drive roll on the underside, and wherein the lower drive roll has a lower stripper bar for separating the strip from the lower drive roll, the first loading device is preferably arranged on the lower stripper bar.<br>
In the case of a rotor hasp the presence of the upper loading device is sufficient. In the case of a multi-hasp device, on the other hand, the deflection device should have also a second loading device for loading the underside of the strip with the medium so that the return of the strip from the final guide channel into the initial guide channel can also be assisted by loading with the medium.<br><br>
The upper loading device is also preferably arranged on an upper stripper bar for removing the strip from the upper drive roll, should such an upper stripper bar be present.<br>
The initial guide channel and the final guide channel are, in general, separated from one another by a switch. The switch can have a pointed tip. Preferably, the tip is however rounded. It is especially advantageous to have a rounded tip which is rotatably supported.<br>
Accordingly   the   present   invention  provides   a   deflecting   equipment   for<br>
deflecting a strip, particularly a metal strip, from an initial guide channel  into<br>
an final guide channel extending near the initial guide channel, wherein the strip<br>
on transiting the initial guide channel has an underside remote from the final<br>
guide channel and an upper side facing the final guide channel, wherein the<br>
deflecting equipment  comprises  a  lower  loading  device  for loading the<br>
underside of the strip with a medium, wherein the deflecting equipment<br>
comprises a drive device with an upper drive roll and a lower drive roll and<br>
wherein the upper drive roll acts on the upper side and the lower drive roll on<br>
the underside, characterised in that the lower drive roll is associated with a<br>
lower stripper bar for stripping the strip from the lower drive roll and that the<br>
lower loading device is arranged at the lower stripper bar.<br>
i<br><br>
Further advantages and details result from the other claims as well as the following description of one embodiment. It is shown in a basic illustration in:<br>
Fig. 1 a deflection device in a first operational state,<br>
Fig. 2 the deflection device of Fig. 1 in a second operational state,<br>
Fig. 3 the deflection device of Fig. in a third operational state,<br>
Fig. 4 the deflection device of Fig. 1 in a fourth operational state,<br>
Fig. 5 a further deflection device in a rotor hasp, and<br>
Fig. 6 a switch.<br><br>
According to Fig. 1 a deflection device comprises a drive device 1, 2 with an upper drive roll 1 and a lower drive roll 2. The drive rolls 1, 2 act on a metal strip 3 with an upper side I and an underside II, pull it out of a roll table 4, and transport it farther into an initial guide channel 5.<br>
The metal strip 3 is a thin metal strip with a strip thickness d of maximally approximately 3 mm. Since the metal strip 3 is hot, there is the risk that it adheres to one of the drive rolls 1, 2 when it is no longer under tension. In order to prevent such an adhesion to the drive rolls 1, 2, the upper drive roll 1 is provided with an upper stripper bar 6 and the lower drive roll 2 with a lower stripper bar 7. By means of the stripper bars 6, 7 the strip 3 is removed from the drive roll 1, 2, respectively, should it adhere thereto.<br>
The risk of adhesion of the strip 3 is present only when the metal strip 3 is pushed by the drive rolls 1, 2 without being tensioned. The stripper bars 6, 7 are therefore preferably adjustable relative to the respective drive rolls 1, 2 in order to effect the wear-causing removal only when the metal strip 3 is pushed. As soon as tension is built up in the metal strip 3 behind the drive rolls 1, 2, the stripper bars 6, 7 are pivoted away from the drive rolls 1, 2.<br>
The metal strip 3, as already mentioned, is transported by means of the drive device 1, 2 out of the roll table 4 and is transported into the initial guide channel 5. A hasp (not illustrated), by which the metal strip 3 is wound, is arranged, for example, at the end of the channel.<br><br>
The metal strip 3 has a finite length and thus also has a strip end 3'. Directly behind the strip end 3', the leading end 8' of the following metal strip 8 is already advancing onto the roll table 4. This following metal strip 8, i.e., already the leading end 8" of the strip, must be deflected into the final guide channel 9 which extends next to the initial guide channel 5. As can be seen in the drawing, the final guide channel 9 is arranged such next to the initial guide channel 5 that the upper sides I of the metal strips 3, 8 face the final guide channel 9 and the undersides II of the metal strips 3, 8 face away from the final guide channel 9 as long as the metal strip 3 passes through the initial guide channel 5.<br>
When the following metal strip 8 is now to be deflected into the final guide channel 9, first the switch 10, which separates the channels 5, 9 from one another, is adjusted such that the open cross-section of the initial guide channel 5 reaches minimal size and that of the final guide channel 9 reaches maximal size. Moreover, the final guide channel 9 is positioned in the expected exit direction x of the following metal strip 8. Already as a result of these measures, the following metal strip 8 in most cases is deflected by the drive device 1, 2 into the final guide channel 9. However, in order to effect with maximum reliability a deflection of the following metal strip into the final guide channel 9, the deflecting device has a back loading device 11. By means of this back loading device 11, the metal strips 3, 8 are loaded at the underside II with pressure by a medium 12. The medium 12 can be in this connection, for example, compressed air or water under pressure.<br><br>
The loading of the underside II of the metal strips 3, 8 with the medium 12 is already carried out while the metal strip 3 passes through the drive device 1, 2. This is not critical with respect to the metal strip 3 and its strip end 3' because the metal strip 3 is pulled with tension into the initial guide channel 5. With respect to the leading end 8' of the following metal strip 8, however, the loading by the medium ensures with utmost reliability a deflection into the final guide channel 9. This situation, i.e., the deflection of the leading end 8' of the following metal strip 8, is illustrated in Fig. 2.<br>
As can be seen in Figs. 1 and 2, the lower loading device 11 is arranged at the'lower stripper bar 7.<br>
The loading of the metal strips 3, 8 with the medium 12, described in connection with Figs. 1 and 2, should be carried out in the opposite direction also when, in reverse order, a change from the final guide channel 9 into the initial guide channel 5 is to be performed. For this purpose, the deflection device also has an upper loading device 13 by which the upper side I of the metal strips 3, 8 can be loaded with the medium 12. In this situation, the upper loading device 13 is also arranged on the corresponding upper stripper bar 6. In other respects, the deflection of the following metal strip 8 illustrated in Figs. 3 and 4 is carried out in analogy to the deflection from the initial guide channel 5 into the final guide channel 9 described in connection with Figs. 1 and 2.<br>
The deflection device, described in connection with Figs. 1 through 4, is used, for example, in a multi-hasp device.  In a multi-hasp<br><br>
device winding occurs alternatingly on one of the two stationarily arranged hasps. On the other hand, in a rotor hasp device, as illustrated in Fig. 5, the initial winding is carried out always at the same location, indicated in Fig. 5 at A. After initial winding of the first windings, the hasp rotor with the two hasp mandrels A and B is pivoted to the location B. Here the greater portion of the metal strip 3 is then wound onto the hasp. During pivoting, the second empty hasp mandrel B is pivoted to the location A in order to be able to wind the initial windings of the following strip 8. During winding, the metal strip 3 passes therefore always through the initial guide channel 5. Only during the initial winding, the following metal strip 8 must be deflected into the final guide channel 9. The reverse deflection into the initial guide channel 5 is carried out at a point in time at which the metal strip 3 or 8 is tensioned so that no deflection device is required for this. In the case of a rotor hasp, it is therefore sufficient when the deflection device is provided only with the upper loading device 11.<br>
As can be seen also in Fig. 5, the switch 10 has a rounded tip 15. Rounding of the tip 15 already avoids damage of the strip end 3' with great reliability. The risk of damage of the strip end 3' is even smaller when the switch tip 15, as illustrated in Fig. 6, is rotatably supported in the switch 10.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
