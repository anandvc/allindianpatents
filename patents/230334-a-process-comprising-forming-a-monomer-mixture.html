				<td>SILICONE HYDROGELS HAVING CONSISTENT CONCENTRATIONS OF MULTI-<br>
FUNCTIONAL POLYSILOXANES<br>
Related Patent Applications<br>
This patent application claims priority of a provisional application, U.S. Ser. No.<br>
60/483,847 which was filed on June 30, 2003.<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to silicone hydrogels having consistent concentrations<br>
of multifunctional components and more particularly multifunctional silicone containing<br>
components. Processes for making silicone hydrogels having consistent concentrations of<br>
multifunctional components are also c isclosed.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Much effort has been made to increase the oxygen permeability of a contact lens to a<br>
level where the lens may be worn for extended periods of time without significant corneal<br>
swelling. One approach to increasing the oxygen permeability has been to include silicone<br>
monomers into materials used to form the contact lens. However, these silicone monomers<br>
tend to be large molecules, which may have many byproducts.<br>
Various silicone containing monomers have found utility as starting materials in the<br>
production of medical devices, such as ophthalmic devices and particularly, soft contact<br>
lenses having improved permeability to oxygen. One class of suitable monomers includes<br>
tris and bis(trimethylsilyloxy)silylalcylglycerol methacrylates ("SiAGMA"). During the<br>
synthesis of SiAGMA certain diester acrylate impurties are also generated. The diester<br>
acrylatec or tree radical reactive difunctional groups act as crossliners during, the<br>
polymerization of the SiAGMAs with other polymer forming components. Unfortunately, it<br>
can be difficult to control the amount of difunctional byproducts which are formed. The<br>
difunctional byproducts effect many of the properties of the lens, including modulus,<br>
equilibrium water content and elongation. Accordingly, the concentration of the difunctional<br><br>
byproducts must be controlled to ensure that the mechanical properties of the resulting<br>
medical device do not vary to an unacceptable degree.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to control of contact lens parameters and properties via<br>
modulation of the concentration in the monomer mix of difunctional silicone-containing<br>
byproducts formed during the synthesis of the starting materials. More specifically the<br>
present invention relates to a process comprising forming a monomer mixture comprising at<br>
least one mono functional silicone containing component which comprises at least one<br>
difunctional byproduct and adding to said monomer mixture a normalizing amount of said at<br>
least one difunctional byproduct and curing said monomer mixture to form a biomedical<br>
device.<br>

Description of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to compositions comprising at least one hydrophilic<br>
component, at least one monofunctional s licone component, and a normalizing amount of at<br>
least one difunctional silicone containing byproduct.<br>
As used herein "byproduct", refers to a composition which is formed as a coproduct<br>
during the synthesis of a monofunctional s ilicone containing component.<br>

either in or on mammalian tissues or fluid, and preferably in or on human tissue or fluids.<br>
Examples of these devices include but are not limited to catheters, implants, stents, and<br>
ophthalmic devices such as intraocular lenses and contact lenses. The preferred biomedical<br>
devices are ophthalmic devices, particularly contact lenses, most particularly contact lenses<br>
made from silicone hydrogels.<br><br>
As used herein, the terms "lens" and "ophthalmic device" refer to devices that reside<br>
in or on the eye. These devices can provide optical correction, wound care, drug delivery,<br>
diagnostic functionality, cosmetic enhancement or effect or a combination of these<br>
properties. The term lens includes but is, not limited to soft contact lenses, hard contact<br>

components used in the prior art to make silicone hydrogels. These terms silicone-<br>
containing component and hydrophilic component are not mutually exclusive, in that, the<br>
silicone-containing component can be somewhat hydrophilic and the hydrophilic component<br>
can comprise some silicone, because the silicone-containing component can have<br>
hydrophilic groups and the hydrophilic components can have silicone groups.<br>
The term "monomer" used herein refers to low molecular weight compounds (i.e.<br>
typically having number average molecular weights less than 1100 g/mol) that can be<br>
polymerized.<br>

[tris(trimethylsiloxy)silyl] propyl ally carbamate; 3-[tris(trimethylsiloxy)silyl] propyl vinyl<br>

which describe polysiloxanes with a polar fluorinated graft or side group having a hydrogen<br>
atom attached to a terminal difluoro-substituted carbon atom.<br><br>
The difunctional silicone contain: ng byproduct is structurally similar to at least one<br>
monofunctional silicone containing component. As used herein structurally similar means<br>
comprising the same silicone groups and preferably comprising all the same functionality,<br>
but for the addition of at least one additional polymerizable group. Examples of suitable<br>
difunctional silicone containing byproducts include bis(trimethylsiloxy)methylsilylpropyl-<br>
1,2-dimethacrylate and 1,3-bis(3-methacryloxypropyl)tetrakis(trimethylsiloxy)disiloxane , a,<br>
ω-bismethacryloypropyl polydimethylsi oxane, mixtures thereof and the like. Examples of<br>

methacryloxypropyl)tetrakis(trimethylsiloxy)disiloxane when TRIS is used, α, ω-<br>
bismethacryloypropyl polydimethylsilo:cane when mPDMS is used, and the like.<br>
It has been found that by including at least one difunctional silicone containing<br>
byproduct as a component in the reactive monomer mix, the resulting silicone hydrogels<br>
have more uniform physical properties :han when a difunctional silicone containing<br>
byproduct is not included. Generally, the monofunctional silicone containing component<br>
will contain some amount of difunctional silicone containing byproduct. However, many<br>
byproducts may be formed during the synthesis of the monofunctional silicone-containing<br>
component and it is generally desirable to minimize their concentration in the<br>
monofunctional silicone-containing component. However, known purification methods<br>
produce monofunctional silicone-containing components with concentrations of difunctional<br>
silicone-containing byproducts which can vary by as much as 5 weight%. Unfortunately<br>
even small variations in the amount of difunctional impurities, such as the difunctional<br>
silicone-containing byproduct can cause significant variance in the physical properties of the<br>
finished lens. The present invention solves, this problem by adding a nonpolising amount of<br>
said difunctional silicone-containing byproduct to the monomer mix. Thus, according to the<br>
present invention, a specification is se for the amount of the difunctional silicone-containing<br>
byproduct in the monomer mix and the amount, of difunctional silicone-containing<br>
byproduct, above the amount present us an impurity in the monofunctional silicone-<br><br>
containing component necessary to meet the specification is added ("normalizing amount").<br>
Large amounts of the difunctional silicone-containing byproduct are not required. Results<br>
according to the present invention may be achieved by including up to about 5 wt%<br>
difunctional silicone containing byproduct, based upon the weight of the monofunctional<br>
silicone-containing component prese it and preferably between about 0.1 and about 5<br>
weight%, and more preferably between about 1 and about 3 weight% difunctional silicone<br>
containing byproduct based upon the weight of the monofunctional silicone-containing<br>
components. In one embodiment a single difunctional byproduct is added in a normalizing<br>
amount.<br>
The difunctional silicone-containing byproducts can be made via numerous methods.<br>
For example, bis(trimethylsiloxy)methylsilylpropyl-l,2-dimethacrylate may be made by<br>
reacting glycidoxypropyl heptamethyltrisiloxane with at least one epoxide opening catalyst,<br>
at least one carboxylic acid, at least one protecting agent and at least one inhibitor at a<br>
temperature above about 60°C for at least about 4 hours.<br>
Hydrophilic components include those which are capable of providing at least about<br>
20% and preferably at least about 25% water content to the resulting lens when combined<br>
with the remaining reactive components. Suitable hydrophilic components may be present<br>
in amounts between about 10 to about 60 weighl% based upon the weight of all reactive<br>
components. About 15 to about 50 weight % and more preferably between about 20 to about<br>
40 weight %. The hydrophilic monomers that may be used to make the polymers of this<br>
invention have at least one polymerizable double bond and at least one hydrophilic<br>
functional group. Examples of polymerizable doable bonds include acrylic, methacrylic,<br>
acrylamido, methacrylamido, fumaric, maleic, styryl, isopropenylphenyl, O-vinylcarbonate,<br>
O-vinylcarbamate, allylic, O-vinylacetyl and N-vinyllactam and N-vinylamido double<br>
bond. Such hydrophilic monomers may themselves be used as cross-linking agents.<br>
"Acrylic-type" or 'acrylic-containing' monomers are those monomers containing the acrylic<br>
group (CR'H=CRCOX)<br>
wherein R is H or CH3, R' is H, alkyl or carbonyl, and X is O or N, which are also known to<br>
polymerize readily, such as N,N-dimethylacrylamide (DMA), 2-hydroxyethyl acrylate ,<br><br>
glycerol methacrylate, 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylamide, polyethyleneglycol<br>
monomethacrylate, methacrylic acid, acrylic acid and mixtures thereof.<br>
Hydrophilic vinyl-containing monomers wluch may be incorporated into the<br>
hydrogels of the present invention include monomers such as N-vinyl lactams (e.g. N-vinyl<br>
pyrrolidone (NVP)), N-vinyl-N-methyl acetamide, N-vinyl-N-ethyl acetamide, N-vinyl-N-<br>
ethyl formamide, N-vinyl formamide, N-2-hydroxyethyl vinyl carbamate, N-carboxy-β-<br>
alanine N-vinyl ester, with NVP being preferred.<br>
Other hydrophilic monomers that can be employed in the invention include<br>
polyoxyethylene polyols having one or more of the terminal hydroxyl groups replaced with a<br>
functional group containing a polymerizable double bond. Examples include polyethylene<br>
glycol reacted with one or more molar equivalents of an end-capping group such as<br>
isocyanatoethyl methacrylate ("IEM"), nethacrylic anhydride, methacryloyl chloride,<br>
vinylbenzoyl chloride, or the like, to produce a polyethylene polyol having one or more<br>
terminal polymerizable olefinic groups bonded to the polyethylene polyol through linking<br>
moieties such as carbamate or ester groups.<br>
Still further examples are the hycrophilic vinyl carbonate or vinyl carbamate<br>
monomers disclosed in U.S. Pat. No.5,0 0,215, and the hydrophilic oxazolone monomers<br>
disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,190,277. Other suitable hydrophilic monomers will be apparent<br>
to one skilled in the art.<br>
More preferred hydrophilic monomers which may be incorporated into the polymer<br>
of the present invention include hydroph lic monomers such as N,N-dimethyl acrylamide<br>

said substances upon incorporation to silicone hydrogel formulations, increase the<br>
wettability of the cured silicone hydrogels. The preferred weight average molecular weight<br><br>

Alternatively, the molecular weight of hydrophilic polymers of the invention can be<br>
also expressed by the K-value, based on kinematic viscosity measurements, as described in<br>
Encyclopedia of Polymer Science and Engineering, N-Vinyl Amide Polymers, Second<br>

Aside from the specifically named high molecular weight hydrophilic polymers, it is<br>
expected that any high molecular weight polymer will be useful in this invention provided<br>
that when said polymer is added to a silicone hydrogel formulation, the hydrophilic polymer<br>
(a) does not substantially phase separate from the reaction mixture and (b) imparts<br>
wettability to the resulting cured polymer. In some embodiments it is preferred mat the high<br>
molecular weight hydrophilic polymer be soluble in the diluent at processing temperatures.<br>
In certain embodiments a hydroxyl containing component is also included. The<br>
hydroxyl containing component that may be used to make the polymers of this invention<br>

The present invention further comprises a process for providing a silicone hydrogel<br>
having consistent mechanical properties and water contents comprising the steps of (a)<br>
forming a monomer mix comprising at least one monofunctional silicone containing<br>
component, at least one hydrophilic component and a normalizing amount of at least one<br>
difunctional silicone containing compor.ent and (b) curing said monomer mix to form said<br>
silicone hydrogel. The normalizing amount of difunctional silicone containing component is<br>
selected to provide the silicone hydrogel with the desired balance of mechanical properties.<br>
The normalizing amount may be experi mentally determined by making several hydrogels<br>
having varying amounts of said multifunctional silicone containing component, measuring<br>
the desired physical properties and selecting the level which provides the desired balance of<br>
properties.<br>
The biomedical devices, and particularly ophthalmic lenses of the present invention<br>
have a balance of properties which makes them particularly useful. Such properties include<br>
water content, modulus, elongation and oxygen permeability. Thus, in one embodiment, the<br>
biomedical devices are contact lenses having a water content of greater than about 20%,<br>
preferably greater than about 25%, and more preferably greater than about 30%.<br>
Suitable oxygen permeabilities are preferably greater than about 40 barrer and more<br>
preferably greater than about 60 barrel. Suitable modulus includes those between about 40<br>
and about 100 psi, and preferably betveen about 50 and about 90 psi. Suitable percent<br>
elongation include between about 50 and about 400%, preferably between about 100 and<br>
about 300%. The present invention allows for the selection and efficient control of<br>
mechanical properties in the manufacture of medical devices and particularly contact lenses.<br>
The normalizing amount may be selected by making articles from a series of monomer<br>
mixtures having varying amounts of difunctional silicone-containing byproduct, analysing<br>
the properties of the articles so made and selecting a difunctional silicone-containing<br><br>
byproduct based upon the articles properties. Thus, according to the present invention,<br>
desirable contact lens properties may be readily maintained without altering the<br>
concentration of other impurities present in the mono functional silicone-containing<br>
component.<br>
Also, the biomedical devices, and particularly ophthalmic devices and contact lenses<br>

and more preferably less than about (5°. In preferred embodiments the articles of the<br>
present invention have combinations of the above described properties. All combinations of<br>
the above ranges are deemed to be w ithin the present invention.<br>

to, e.g., about 5000), and other polyacrylate and polymethacrylate esters, such as the end-<br>
capped polyoxyethylene polyols described abcve containing two or more terminal<br>
methacrylate moieties. The cross-linking agents are used in the usual amounts, e.g., from<br>
about 0.0004 to about 0.02 mole per 100 grams of reactive components in the reaction<br>
mixture. (The reactive components are everything in the reaction mixture except the diluent<br>
and any additional processing aids which do not become part of the structure of the<br>
polymer.) Alternatively, id the hydrophilic monomers and/or the silicons-containing<br>
monomers act as the cross-linking agent, the addition of a crosslinking agent to the reaction<br>
mixture is optional. Examples of hydrophilic monomers which can act as the crosslinking<br>
agent and when present, do not req lire the addition of an additional crosslinking agent to the<br><br>
reaction mixture include polyoxyethylene polyols described above containing two or more<br>
terminal methacrylate moieties.<br>

Volume III, Photoinitiators for Free Radical Calionic &amp; Anionic Photopolymerization, 2nd<br>
Edition by J.V. Crivello &amp; K. Dietliker; edited by G. Bradley; John Wiley and Sons; New<br>
York; 1998, which is incorporated hereintoforinto by reference. The initiator is used in the<br>
reaction mixture in. effective amount: to initiate photopolymerisation of the reaction mixture,<br>
e.g., from about 0.1 to about 2 parts by weight per 100 parts of reactive monomer.<br>
Polymerization of the reaction mixture can be initiated using the appropriate choice of heat<br>
or visible or ultraviolet light or other means depending on the polymerization initiator used.<br>
Alternatively, initiation can be conducted without a photoinitiator using, for example, e-<br><br>
beam. However, when a photoinitiator is used, the preferred initiators are bisacylphosphine<br>
oxides, such as bis(2,4,6-trimethylbenzoyl)-phenyl phosphine oxide (Irgacure 819®) or a<br>
combination of 1-hydroxycyclohexyl phenyl ketone and bis(2,6-dimethoxybenzoyl)-2,4-4-<br>
trimethylpentyl phosphine oxide (DMBAPO) , and the preferred method of polymerization<br>
initiation is visible light. The most preferred is bi3(2,4,6-trimethylbenzoyl)-phenyl phosphine<br>
oxide (Irgacure 819®).<br>
The monomer mix may contain additional components such as, but not limited to,<br>
UV absorbers, medicinal agents, antimicrobial compounds, reactive tints, pigments,<br>
copolymerizable and nonpolymerizable dyes, release agents and combinations thereof.<br>
The preferred range of monofunctional silicone-containing monmers present in the<br>
monomer mix is from about 5 to 95 weight percent, more preferably about 30 to 85 weight<br>
percent, and most preferably about 4) to 75 weight percent of the reactive components in the<br>

The reaction mixtures of the present invention can be formed by any of the methods<br>
know to those skilled in the art, such is shaking or stirring, and used to form polymeric<br>
articles or devices by known methods.<br>
For example, the biomedical c evices of the invention may be prepared by mixing<br>
reactive components and the diluent(s) with a polymerization initator and curing by<br>
appropriate conditions to form a prod act that can. be subsequently formed into the<br>
appropriate shape by lathing, cutting and the like. Alternatively, the reaction mixture may be<br>
placed in a mold and subsequently cured into the appropriate article.<br>
Various processes are known for processing the reaction mixture in the production of<br>
contact lenses, including spincasting and static casting. Spincasting methods are disclosed in<br>
U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,408,429 and 3,660,545, and static casting methods are disclosed in U.S. Pat.<br>
Nos. 4,113,224 and 4,197,266. The preferred method for producing contact lenses<br>
comprising the polymer of this invention is by the molding of the silicone hydrogels, which<br>
is economical, and enables precise control over the final shape of the hydrated lens. For this<br>
method, the reaction mixture is placed in a mold having the shape of the final desired<br>
silicone hydrogel, i.e., water-swollen polymer, and the reaction mixture is subjected to<br>
conditions whereby the monomers polymerize, to thereby produce a polymer/diluent mixture<br>
in the shape of the final desired prodict. Then, this polymer/diluent mixture is treated with a<br>
solvent to remove the diluent and ultimately replace it with water, producing a silicone<br>
hydrogel having a. final size and shape which are quite similar to the size and shape of the<br>
original molded polymer/diluent article. This method can be used to form contact lenses and<br>
is further described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 1,495,313; 4,680,336; 4,889,664; and 5,039,459,<br>
incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Haze is measured by placing ;. hydrated test lens in borate buffered saline in a clear<br>
20 x 40 10 mm glass cell at ambien temperature above a flat black background.<br>
illuminating from below svith a fiber optic lamp (Titan Tool Supply Co. fiber optic light with<br>
0.5" diameter light guide set at a power setting of 4-5.4) at an angle 66° normal to the lens<br>
cell, and capturing an image of the lens from above, normal to the lens cell with a video<br>
camera (DVC 1300C:19130 RGB camera with Navitar TV Zoom 7000 zoom lens) placed 14<br><br>
mm above the lens platform. Th; background scatter is subtracted from the scatter of the<br>
lens by subtracting an image of a blank cell using EPIX XCAP V 1.0 software. The<br>
subtracted scattered light image is quantitatively analyzed, by integrating over the central 10<br>
mm of the lens, and then comparing to a -1.00 diopter CSI Thin Lens®, which is arbitrarily<br>
set at a haze value of 100, with no lens set as a haze value of 0. Five lenses are analyzed and<br>
the results are averaged to generate a haze value as a percentage of the standard CSI lens.<br>
The water content of contact lenses was measured as follows: Three sets of three<br>
lenses are allowed to sit in packing solution for 24 hours. Each lens is blotted with damp<br>
wipes and weighed. The lenses are dried at 60°C for four hours at a pressure of 0.4 inches<br>
Hg or less. The dried lenses are weighed. The water content is calculated as follows:<br><br>
The average and standarc deviation of the water content are calculated for the<br>
samples are reported.<br>
Modulus is measured by using the crosshead of a constant rate of movement type<br>
tensile testing machine equipped with a load cell that is lowered to the initial gauge height.<br>
A suitable testing machine includes an Instron model 1122. A dog-bone shaped sample<br>
having a 0.522 inch length, 0.276 inch tear" width and 0.213 inch "neck" width is loaded<br>
into the grips and elongated at a constant rate of strain of 2 in/min. until it breaks. The initial<br>
gauge length of the sample (Lo) and sample length at break (Lf) are measured. Twelve<br>
specimens of each composition are measured and the average is reported. Percent elongation<br>
is = [(Lf- Lo)/Lo]x 100. Tensile modulus is measured at the initial linear portion of the<br>
stress/strain curve.<br>
The advacing, contact angle was measured as follows. Four samples from each cot<br>
were prepared by cutting out a center strip from the lens approximately 5 mm in width and<br>
equilibrated in packing solution. The wetting force between the lens surface and borate<br>
buffered saline is measured at 2°C using a Wilhelmy microbalance while the sample is<br>
being immersed into or pulled out of the saline. The following equation is used<br><br><br>
where F is the wetting force, γ is the surface tension of the probe liquid, p is the perimeter of<br>
the sample at the meniscus and θ is the contact angle. The advancing contact angle is<br>
obtained from the portion of the wotting experiment where the sample is being immersed<br>
into the packing solution. Each sample was cycled four times and the results were averaged<br>
to obtain the advancing contact angles for the lens.<br>
The Dk is measured as follows. Lenses are positioned on a polarographic oxygen<br>
sensor consisting of a 4 mm diameter gold cathode and a silver ring anode then covered on<br>
the upper side with a mesh support. The lens is exposed to an atmosphere of humidified<br>
2.1% O2. The oxygen that diffuses through the lens is measured by the sensor. Lenses are<br>
either stacked on top of each other to increase the thickness or a thicker lens is used. The<br>
L/Dk of 4 samples with significantly different thickness values are measured and plotted<br>
against the thickness. The inverse of the regressed slope is the Dk of the sample. The<br>
reference values are those measured on commercially available contact lenses using this<br>
method. Balafilcon A lenses available from Bausch &amp; Lomb give a measurement of approx.<br>
79 barrer. Etafilcon lenses give a measurement of 20 to 25 barrer. (1 barrer = 10-10 (cm3 of<br>
gas x cm2)/(cm3 of polymer x sec x cm Hg)).<br>
The Examples below further describe this invention, but do not limit the invention.<br>
They are meant only to suggest a method of practicing the invention. Those knowledgeable<br>
in the field of contact lenses as well as other specialties may find other methods of practicing<br>
the invention. However, those methods are deemed to be within the scope of this invention.<br>
Some of the materials that are employed in the Examples are identified as follows:<br><br><br><br>

listed below:<br><br>
The mixture was stirred vigorously, and heated to 100° C for 7.5 hours. Once the<br>
reaction was complete, it was allowed to cool to ambient conditions, and transferred to a 500<br>
mL separatory funnel.<br>
The organics were diluted w th 100mL of hexanes, washed with 3x200mL of 0.5N<br>
aqueous NaOH, followed with 3x100mL of 2.5% aqueous NaCl. The organics were dried with<br>
5.0g of sodium sulfate, and the material was filtered over a fritted glass funnel.<br>
The filtrate was treated with 15g of silica gel, and the system was trituated for 3 hours.<br>
The organics were filtered over a fritted glass funnel, and the trituation was repeated using an<br>
additional 15g of silica gel for another 3 hours. The desired product was isolated after filtration<br>
over a flitted glass funnel, followed by evaporation of volatile components at 55°C under a<br>
vacuum pf

Examples 1-4<br><br>
Monomer mixes were made from the components listed in Table 1, using the<br>
following procedure.<br>
The components were combined and mixed for approximately 4 hours at a<br>
temperature of about 30 °C. A diluent comprising 72.5% t-amyl alcohol and 27.5% PVP K-<br>
12 was added at a ratio of 60% monomer mix to 40% diluent. The reactive monomer mix<br>
was dispensed into a front curve mold then a back curve mold was affixed on top of the<br>
monomer mix. The assembled part was then passed down a tunnel with three zones heated<br>
to 67°C in zone 1, 65 °C in zone 2 and 61°C in zone 3, under visible light (intensity of 600,<br>
800 and 800 mW/cm2) to initiate the lens curing process. The total cure time was 3.75<br>
minutes. After cure, the back curve mold was removed with the cured lenses and placed into<br>
a hydrating solution of 70:30 IPA/DI water, at ambient temperature for about 60 minutes,<br>
and then into DI water for about 120 minutes during which time the lenses released from the<br>
back cure mold and were removed from the back curve mold using a swab. The lenses were<br>
put into blister packages containing suline packaging solution, sealed and sterilized at 121°C<br>
for 29 minutes.<br><br>
The modulus and elongation of the lenses were measured and the results are shown in Table<br>
