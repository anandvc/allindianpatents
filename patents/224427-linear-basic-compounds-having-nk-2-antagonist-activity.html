LINEAR BASIC COMPOUNDS HAVING NK-2 ANTAGONIST ACTIVITY AND<br>
FORMULATIONS THEREOF<br>
Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to compounds antagonists of tachykinins in general, in<br>
particular of neurokinin A, and to their use in pharmaceutical formulations.<br>
State of the art<br>
Tachykinms is a family including at least three peptides, known as Substance V,<br>
Neurokinin A (NKA) e Neurokinin B (NKB).<br>
The research in the field of the tachykinins antagonist, mainly based on single or multle<br>
substitution of amino acids of the sequence of the peptidic agonists of Substance P and of<br>
the other tachykinins, lead to the discovery of nonzeptides containing one or more units<br>
of D-triptophan (Regoli et al., Pharmacol. 28,301 (1984)). However, the problems derived<br>
from the pharmacological use of high molecular weit pq&gt;tides (multiple sites of<br>
enzymatic hydrolytic attack, poor bioavailability, rapid hepatic and renal excretion)<br>
induced to search the minimum peptidic fragment which is still capable of exerting an<br>
antagonist activity. These studies lead to the detection of adequately derivatised bicyclic<br>
and monocychc peptides, antagonist of neurokinin A (Patent Applications No. WO<br>
9834949 and No. WO 200129066).<br>
Various compounds have been claimed as selective antagonists of Substance P, for<br>
instance in Patent Applications No. WO 9519966 andNo7wo'9845262;but, besides being<br>
selective for NKl receptor, these compounds have structural characteristics which are<br>
different from the compounds of the present invention, mainly the lack of a basic amino<br>
group.<br>
Among NKl antagonists, we can also mention those described in Patent Application No.<br>
WO 200014109; among these compounds, there is not even one alpha,alpha-disubstituted<br>
I<br>
amino acid, and the basic group, when present, is in positions that are very different from<br>
those in the compounds of the invention.<br>
Also in Patent No. EP 394 989 the compounds with NKl activity do not usually have a<br>
basic group and do hot exhibit an alpha,alpha-disubstituted amino acid.<br>
In Biorganic &amp; Med. Ckem. (1994), 2 (2), 101-113 (S. Boile et; al.) compounds wiih NK2<br>
activity are described, which contain an alpha,alpha-disubstituted phenylalanine (Phe)â€žbut<br><br>
they do not exhibit the basic characteristics nor they can be associated to the structure<br>
described by the general formula (I).<br>
In Patent Application No. WO 9404494 NKl antagonists are described, which exhibit a<br>
disubstituted alpha,alpha-aimno acid whose structure do not correspond to the general<br>
formula (I), in particular for the presence -among other things - of a -0-CO- group in the<br>
place of XI.<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
It has been surprisingly found that the present non peptidic compomids of general formula<br>
(I) as defined hereinafter, show abetter behaviour in inhibiting the bonding of tachykinins<br>
onto the receptor NK2, and a better in vivo antagonist activity than that showed by the<br>
products disclosed in the above cited prior art patents.<br>
The present invention refers therefore to linear compounds of general formula (I)<br>
comprising an alfa,alfa-disubstituted amino acid and at least an amino group capable of<br>
giving basic characteristics to the compounds<br>

stirring. After iO nun 3-aminopropanol (1.25 g, 16.72 mmol) dissolved in DMF (60 ml) is added to the solution, and the reaction mixture is kept at room temperature for 12 hours. The mixture is then diluted with AcOEt (200 ml) and extracted with KHSO4 (5% solution, 200 ml) and with NaHCOa (saturated solution, 2O0 ml). The organic phase, dried on Na2S04, filtered and brought to dryness, is then washed with ethyl ether and the white solid in suspension is filtered to give the desired product (5.15 g, 14.5 mmol).

Stirring is maintained for 10 hours, then the solvent is evaporated, the residue is dissolved in ethyl acetate and washed with NaCI aq. 10%, citric acid aq. 10% and again with NaCl aq. 10%. After drying and evaporation, the residue is then dissolved in 200 ml of DMF. To th eso obtamed solution 2000 ml of distilled water are added drop by drop.

Under magnetic stirring, 15 ml of oxalyl chloride and 3 drops of DMF are added successively. The solution, that regularly degasses, is kept under magnetic stirring for 16 hours. After evaporation of ihe solvent, the residue is dried in hard vacuxim at room temperature, dissolved in 100 ml of CH2CI2 and put in a bath of ice and water, maintaining a vigorous magnetic stirring.

The evaluation of the antagonist activity on NK-2 receptors has been assessed by binding<br>
and iimctional tests according to that already described in literature in relation to NK-2<br>
antagonists.<br>
In particular, the affinity of the present compounds for the human NK-2 receptor has been<br>
assessed by a binding test using Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell membranes transfected<br>
with NK-2 receptor of hxmian ileum together with ['^^I]NKA (Am^sham, aspecific<br>
activity 2000 Ci/mmol) radiobinder at the concentration of 100 pM in competition studies.<br><br>
The test substances have been tested within a concentration range from 0.01 nM to 10 nM. At the end of the incubation time (30 min, 20Â°C) the samples have been filtered and radioactivity has been determined using a gamma-counter.<br>
The data shown in the following Table I have been obtained for some compounds of general formula (I) and refer to the afEinity values of human NK-2 receptor:<br><br><br><br><br><br>
The present compounds of formula (I) can be handled according to the common pharmacopoeial techniques in order to prepare formulations suitable for oral, intranasal, parentheral, sublingual, inhalatory, transdermic, local or rectal use according to the data known in literature for this kind of products; these formulations comprise oral fomiulations, such as tablets, capsules, powders, granulated preparations, and oral solutions or suspensions, formulations for sublingual administration, for intranasal administration, aerosol formulations, implantations, formulations for subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravenous, intraocular-and rectal administration. Xhe effectiva doses, are 0.1 to 50 mg/kg of body weight. For humans the effective dose may preferably range from 0.5 to 4000 jng/day, in particular from 2.5 to 1000 mg according to the age of patients and to the type of treatment.<br>
The treatment is performed by administering to the patient the required amoimt 1 to 4 times-per-day for periods of time up to 2 weeks or in any case until remission of symFjtoms; for chronic pathologies, administration can be prolonged for significantly longer periods of time according to the physician judgement<br>
Thanks to their high antagonist activity to tachykinins NK-2 receptor, the present compounds are useful in tbetreatment of diseases in which Neurokinine A plays a pathogenetic role, and namely in the following pathologies:<br>
