				<td>The   present   invention   relates    to   a   heterocyclic    amide    substituted theinopyrrole compound and process thereof.<br>
The present invention relates to heterocyclic amide derivatives, pharmaceutically acceptable salts and in vivo hydrolysable esters thereof. These heterocyclic amides possess glycogen phosphorylase inhibitory activity and accordingly have value in the treatment of disease states associated with increased glycogen phosphorylase activity and thus are potentially useful in methods of treatment of a warm-blooded animal such as man. The invention also relates to processes for the manufacture of said heterocyclic amide derivatives, to pharmaceutical compositions containing them and to their use in the manufacture of medicaments to inhibit glycogen phosphorylase activity in a warm-blooded animal such as man.<br>
The liver is the major organ regulating glycaemia in the post-absorptive state. Additionally, although having a smaller role in the contribution to post-prandial blood glucose levels, the response of the liver to exogenous sources of plasma glucose is key to an ability to maintain euglycaemia. An increased hepatic glucose output (HGO) is considered to play an important role in maintaining the elevated fasting plasma glucose (FPG) levels seen in type 2 diabetics; particularly those with a EPG &gt;140mg/dl (7.8mM). (Weyer et al, (1999), J Clin Invest 104: 787-794; Clore &amp; Blackgard (1994), Diabetes 43: 256-262; De Fronzo, R. A., et al, (1992) Diabetes Care 15; 318 - 355; Reaven, G.M. (1995) Diabetologia 38; 3-13).<br>
Since current oral, anti-diabetic therapies fail to bring FPG levels to within the normal, non-diabetic range and since raised FPG (and glycHbAlc) levels are risk factors for both macro- (Charles, M.A. et al (1996) Lancet 348, 1657-1658; Coutinho, M. et al (1999) Diabetes Care 22; 233-240; Shaw, IE. et al (2000) Diabetes Care 23, 34-39) and micro-vascular disease (DCCT Research Group (1993) New. Eng. J. Med. 329; 977-986); the reduction and normalisation of elevated FPG levels remains a treatment goal in type 2 DM.<br>
It has been estimated that, after an overnight fast, 74% of HGO was derived from glycogenolysis with the remainder derived from gluconeogenic precursors (Hellerstein et al (1997) Am J Physiol, 272: E163). Glycogen phosphorylase is a key enzyme in the generation by glycogenolysis of glucose-1-phosphate, and hence glucose in liver and also in other tissues such as muscle and neuronal tissue.<br>
Liver glycogen phosphorylase a activity is elevated in diabetic animal models including the db/db mouse and the fa/fa rat (Aiston S et al (2000). Diabetalogia 43, 589-597).<br><br><br>
Inhibition of hepatic glycogen phosphorylase with chloroindole inhibitors (CP91149 and CP320626) has been shown to reduce both glucagon stimulated glycogenolysis and glucose output in hepatocytes (Hoover et al (1998) J Med Chem 41, 2934-8; Martin et al (1998) PNAS 95,1776-81). Additionally, plasma glucose concentration is reduced, in a dose related manner, db/db and ob/ob mice following treatment with these compounds.<br>
Studies in conscious dogs with glucagon challenge in the absence and presence of another glycogen phosphorylase inhibitor, Bay K 3401, also show the potential utility of such agents where there is elevated circulating levels of glucagon, as in both Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes. In the presence of Bay R 3401, hepatic glucose output and arterial plasma glucose following a glucagon challenge were reduced significantly (Shiota et al, (1997), Am J Physiol, 273: E868).<br>
The heterocyclic amides of the present invention possess glycogen phosphorylase inhibitory activity and accordingly are expected to be of use in the treatment of type 2 diabetes, insulin resistance, syndrome X, hyperinsulinaemia, hyperglucagonaemia, cardiac ischaemia and obesity, particularly type 2 diabetes.<br>

The present invention relates to the compounds of formula (1) as hereinbefore defined as well as to the salts thereof. Salts for use in pharmaceutical compositions will be pharmaceutically acceptable salts, but other salts may be useful in the production of the compounds of formula (1) and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the invention may, for example, include acid addition salts of the compounds of formula (1) as hereinbefore defined which are sufficiently basic to form such salts. Such acid addition salts include for example salts with inorganic or organic acids affording pharmaceutically acceptable anions such as with hydrogen halides (especially hydrochloric or hydrobromic acid of which hydrochloric acid is particularly preferred) or with sulphuric or phosphoric acid, or with trifluoroacetic, citric or maleic acid. Suitable salts include hydrochlorides, hydrobromides, phosphates, sulphates, hydrogen sulphates, alkylsulphonates, arylsulphonates, acetates, benzoates, citrates, maleates, fumarates, succinates, lactates and tartrates. In addition where the compounds of formula (1) are sufficiently acidic, pharmaceutically acceptable salts may be formed with an inorganic or organic base which affords a pharmaceutically acceptable cation. Such salts with inorganic or organic bases include for example an alkali metal salt, such as a sodium or potassium salt, an<br>
alkaline earth metal salt such as a calcium or magnesium salt, an ammonium salt or for example a salt with methylamine, dimethylamine, trimethylamine, piperidine, morpholine or tris-(2-hydroxyethyl)amine.<br>
The compounds of the invention may be administered in the form of a pro-drug which is broken down in the human or animal body to give a compound of the invention. A prodrug may be used to alter or improve the physical and/or phannacokmetic profile of the parent compound and can be formed when the parent compound contains a suitable group or substituent which can be derivatised to form a prodrug. Examples of pro-drugs include in-vivo hydrolysable esters of a compound of the invention or a pharmaceutically-acceptable salt thereof.<br>
Various forms of prodrugs are known in the art, for examples see:<br>

Another aspect of the present invention provides a process for preparing a compound of formula (1) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or an in vivo hydrolysable ester thereof which process (wherein A, R1, R2, R3, R4, R5, n and — are, unless otherwise specified, as defined in formula (1)) comprises of: a) reacting an acid of the formula (2):<br>
(Figure Remove)<br><br><br><br>
or an activated derivative thereof; with an amine of formula (3):<br>
(Figure Remove)<br>
and thereafter if necessary:<br>
i) converting a compound of the formula (1) into another compound of the formula (1);<br>
ii) removing any protecting groups;<br>
iii) forming a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or in vivo hydrolysable ester.<br>
Specific reaction conditions for the above reaction are as follows.<br>
Process a)      Acids of formula (2) and amines of formula (3) may be coupled together in the presence of a suitable coupling reagent. Standard peptide coupling reagents known in the art can be employed as suitable coupling reagents, or for example carbonyldiimidazole, l-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodi-imide hydrochloride (EDO) and dicyclohexyl-carbodiimide (DCCI), optionally in the presence of a catalyst such as 1-hydroxybenzotriazole, dimethylaminopyridine or 4-pyrrolidinopyridine, optionally in the presence of a base for example triethylamine, di-isopropylethylamine, pyridine, or 2,6-di-alkyl-pvridines such as 2,6-lutidine or 2,6-di-tert-butylpyridine. Suitable solvents include dimethylacetamide, dichloromethane, benzene, tetrahydrofuran and dimethylformamide. The coupling reaction may conveniently be performed at a temperature in the range of-40 to 40°C.<br>
Suitable activated acid derivatives include acid halides, for example acid chlorides, and active esters, for example pentafluorophenyl esters. The reaction of these types of compounds with amines is well known in the art, for example they may be reacted in the presence of a base, such as those described above, and in a suitable solvent, such as those described above. The reaction may conveniently be performed at a temperature in the range of<br>
-40 to 40°C.<br>
Where R of formula (1) contains an ester group, the conversion of a compound of the formula (1) into another compound of the formula (1) may involve hydrolysis of the ester group, for example, acid or base hydrolysis, for example using lithium hydroxide. The reaction of this type is well known in the art.<br>
Substituted amides wherein R3 is CH2C(O)N(R9)(R10) may be prepared from the corresponding acids by a coupling reaction using the appropriate amine in the presence of a coupling reagent, for example EDCI. Alternatively, the acid may first be converted to a mixed anhydride, by reaction with, for example, ethyl chloroformate, which is reacted with an appropriate amine to produce the substituted amide. Substituted sulphonamides wherein R3 is CH2C(O)NHSO2Rg may be prepared similarly, for instance by coupling the compounds wherein R3 is CHaCOaH with the appropriate substituted sulphonamide in the presence of a coupling reagent, for example EDCI.<br>
Compounds of formula (1) wherein R3 is 2-hydroxyethyl may be prepared by reduction of the mixed anhydrides described above with, for example, lithium borohydride. Compounds of formula (1) wherein R3 is an oxadiazol-5-ylmethyl group may be prepared by reaction of the mixed anhydrides described above with an appropriately substituted hydroxyamidine, for example Ar-hydroxyethanimidamide, in the presence of a base such as N-methylmorpholine.<br>
Compounds of formula (1) wherein R3 is a tetrazol-5-yknethyl group may be prepared by reaction of the corresponding compounds where R3 is a cyanomethyl group with an azide, for example sodium azide, in the presence of an amine salt, for instance triethylamine hydrochloride. Compounds of formula (1) wherein R3 is 2-amino-2-(hydroxyimino)ethyl may be prepared by reaction of compounds wherein R3 is cyanomethyl with hydroxylamine hydrochloride in the presence of a base, for example sodium methoxide.<br>
Compounds of formula (1) wherein R3 is a 2-(methylsulphonyl)ethyl or 2-(methylsulphinyl)ethyl group may be prepared by reaction of the corresponding compounds where R3 is 2-methylthioethyl with an oxidising agent, for example oxone.<br>
Compounds of formula (1) wherein R3 is a dihydroxyalkyl group, for example 2,3-dihydroxypropyl or 2-(hydroxymethyl)-3-hydroxypropyl may be prepared by acid hydrolysis of the corresponding compounds of formula (1) wherein R3 is a protected dihydroxyalkyl<br>
group for example (2,2-dimethyl-l,3-dioxan-5-yl)methyl, (2,2-dimethyl-l,3-dioxolan-4-yl)methyl or (2-oxo-l,3-dioxan-5-yl)methyl.<br>

Heterocycl. Chem 2000,37(1). 119-126) and finally hydrolysing the cyano group to a carboxy group, with for example, an aqueous acid such as aqueous hydrogen chloride (for example see Chem. Pharm. Butt. 1986, 34(9). 3635-43).<br>
Alternatively, a compound of the formula (2) wherein X is N may be formed by reacting the compound of the formula (6) with (CkCCO^O and ClaCCC^H in the presence of magnesium chloride using ClaCCOiH as solvent, to form a compound of the formula (7):<br>
(Figure Remove)<br>
and then hydrolyising the compound of the formula (7), using, for example, aqueous sodium hydroxide, at a temperature range of ambient temperature to reflux (for example see J Heterocyd. Chem. 1980,17(2), 381-2).<br>

(Figure Remove)<br>
The compounds of the formula (10) and (11): R4<br><br>
(Figure Remove)<br>
transform into compounds of the formula (12) and (13) respectively. This transformation either occurs spontaneously or may be induced with acid or base.<br>
(Figure Remove)<br>
Compounds of the formula (10) and (11) may be prepared by introducing a carboxy group into a compound of the formula (8) or (9):<br>
wherein P' is an amino protecting group such as butoxycarbonyl.<br>
A carboxy group is introduced into the compound of the formula (8) or (9) by reacting an alkyl lithium reagent such as n-butyl lithium, in an inert organic solvent such as THF, at<br>
-50-low temperature, for example in the range -10°C to -78°C and then forming the compound of the formula (10) or (11) as appropriate by either<br>
a)	reacting the resulting compound with carbon dioxide; or<br>
b)	by reacting with DMF in the temperature range of -10°C to ambient temperature to<br>
form the corresponding aldehyde and oxidizing the aldehyde to carboxy with standard<br>
reagents to give the compound of the formula (10) or (11).<br>
Compounds of the formula (8) and (9) may be prepared from a compound of the formula (14) and (15): <br>
(Figure Remove)<br>
(14) using conditions known for the Curtius reaction.<br>
Compounds of the formula (14) and (15) may be prepared by oxidizing the corresponding aldehyde using standard oxidizing reagents such as potassium manganate or sodium periodate.<br>
The aldehyde precursor of a compound of the formula (14) or (15) can be prepared using standard techniques known in the art. For example, many compounds of the formula (14) or (15) may be prepared by introducing the appropriate R6 and R7 into a compound of the formula (16) or (17) as appropriate:<br>
(Figure Remove)<br>
For example, when R6 and R7 are both chloro a compound of the formula (16) or (17) may be chlorinated with a chlorinating agent such as chlorine in the presence of aluminium chloride or iron (ffi) chloride, in an inert organic chlorinated solvent such as dichloromethane or 1,2-dichloroethane, followed by treatment with an aqueous base, such as, aqueous sodium hydroxide. The mono chlorinated compound can be formed in the same way.<br>
-51-Compounds of formula (3) may be prepared by reacting an amine of formula (4)<br><br>
(Figure Remove)<br>
with R3-L where L is a suitable leaving group (for example chloro, bromo or iodo) in the presence of a base such as sodium hydride in a suitable solvent.<br>
Compounds of the fonnula (4) wherein A is phenylene and	is a single bond<br>
may be made from 3-amino-3,4-dihydroquinolin-2-(lH)-one hydrochloride (J. Med. Chem.,<br><br>
28,1985,1511-16). Compounds of the formula (4) wherein A is phenylene and	is a<br>
double bond may be prepared by the reductive cyclisation of a compound of fonnula (18), using for example tin (II) chloride in hydrochloric acid, followed by removal of the Boc protecting group, using for example trifluoroacetic acid. Compounds of formula (18) may be prepared by reaction of compounds of formula (19) by reaction with a compound of formula (20) in the presence of a base, for example tetramethylguanidine. Compounds of fonnula (19) are commercially available or described in the literature.<br>
Compounds of the formula (4) wherein A is heterocyclylene can be prepared from cyclisation of suitably functionalised heterocycles. For example, when A is pyridine,<br>

compounds of fonnula (4a) and (4b) may be prepared from an appropriately substituted nitro-methyl pyridine or amino-pyridine according to the Schemes 2 and 3:-<br>
(Figure Remove)<br>
Steps 1 and 2 may be carried out by the process described in Tetrahedron 1998,54(23), 6311-<br>
6318.<br>
Step 3 may be carried out by the method described in Synthesis 1992 (5) ,487<br>
Assymetric hydrogenation reactions of olefins as shown in Step 4 are well known (see for<br>
example, SACS 1993,115,10125-10138) and lead to homochiral final products.<br>
Step 5 may alternatively be carried out by hydrolysing the ester and activating the resulting<br>
acid with a carbodiimide such as EDCI or DCCI, or by preparing an acid chloride, or<br>
activated ester such as an N -hydroxysuccinimide ester. Suitable bases are organic base such<br>
as triethylamine or di-isopropylethylamine (DJDPEA) or l,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene<br>
(DBU).<br>
In Step 6 X is a leaving group, for example Cl, Br, I, OMesyl. In Step 7 alternative solvents such as dichloromethane or other acids such as trifluoroacetic acid can be used.<br>
using conditions known for the Mitsunobu reaction (Bull. Chem. Soc. Jpn., 1967,40,2380). Compounds of the formula (23) and (24) are commercially available.<br>
Compounds of formula (2b) may also be prepared as illustrated in Scheme 4:<br>
 (Figure Remove)<br>
The conversion of compounds of formula (8) into compounds of formula (25) may be carried out by directed ortho lithiation reactions (J. Org. Chem, 2001, volume 66, 3662-3670), for example with n-butyl lithium and (CHO)N(alkyl)2. The protecting group P' in compounds of formula (8) must be suitable directing group for this reaction and may be for example -CO2tfiu. Reaction of compounds of formula (25) with LCI^CC^R where L is a leaving group, and replacement of the protecting group P' with an alternative P" (for example -COalkyl) according to standard processes, gives a compound of formula (26). This may be cyclised using a base, for example potassium carbonate or sodium methoxide.<br>
Compounds of the formula (4) wherein A is heteroarylene and there is a bridgehead heteroatom, for example, compounds of the formula (4d) may be made by analogous chemistry to that shown for making compounds of the formula (4c).<br>

It will be appreciated that certain of the various ring substituents in the compounds of the present invention, for example R1, may be introduced by standard aromatic substitution reactions or generated by conventional functional group modifications either prior to or<br><br>
immediately following the processes mentioned above, and as such are included in the process aspect of the invention. Such reactions may convert one compound of the formula (1) into another compound of the formula (1). Such reactions and modifications include, for example, introduction of a substituent by means of an aromatic substitution reaction, reduction of substituents, alkylation of substituents and oxidation of substituents. The reagents and reaction conditions for such procedures are well known in the chemical art. Particular examples of aromatic substitution reactions include the introduction of a nitro group using concentrated nitric acid, the introduction of an acyl group using, for example, an acyl halide and Lewis acid (such as aluminium trichloride) under Friedel Crafts conditions; the introduction of an alkyl group using an alkyl halide and Lewis acid (such as aluminium trichloride) under Friedel Crafts conditions; and the introduction of a halogen group. Particular examples of modifications include the reduction of a nitro group to an amino group by for example, catalytic hydrogenation with a nickel catalyst or treatment with iron in the presence of hydrochloric acid with heating; oxidation of alkylthio to alkylsulphinyl or alkylsulphonyl.<br>
It will also be appreciated that in some of the reactions mentioned herein it may be necessary/desirable to protect any sensitive groups in the compounds. The instances where protection is necessary or desirable and suitable methods for protection are known to those skilled in the art. Conventional protecting groups may be used in accordance with standard practice (for illustration see T.W. Green, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, John Wiley and Sons, 1991). Thus, if reactants include groups such as amino, carboxy or hydroxy it may be desirable to protect the group in some of the reactions mentioned herein.<br>
A suitable protecting group for an amino or alkylamino group is, for example, an acyl group, for example an alkanoyl group such as acetyl, an alkoxycarbonyl group, for example a methoxycarbonyl, ethoxycarbonyl or r-butoxycarbonyl group, an arylmethoxycarbonyl group, for example benzyloxycarbonyl, or an aroyl group, for example benzoyl. The deprotection conditions for the above protecting groups necessarily vary with the choice of protecting group. Thus, for example, an acyl group such as an alkanoyl or alkoxycarbonyl group or an aroyl group may be removed for example, by hydrolysis with a suitable base such as an alkali metal hydroxide, for example lithium or sodium hydroxide. Alternatively an acyl group such as a f-butoxycarbonyl group may be removed, for example, by treatment with a suitable acid as hydrochloric, sulphuric or phosphoric acid or trifluoroacetic acid and an<br><br>
arylmethoxycarbonyl group such as a benzyloxycarbonyl group may be removed, for example, by hydrogenation over a catalyst such as palladium-on-carbon, or by treatment with a Lewis acid for example boron tris(trifluoroacetate). A suitable alternative protecting group for a primary ammo group is, for example, a phthaloyl group which may be removed by treatment with an alkylamine, for example dimethylaminopropylamine, or with hydrazine.<br>
A suitable protecting group for a hydroxy group is, for example, an acyl group, for example an alkanoyl group such as acetyl, an aroyl group, for example benzoyl, or an arylmethyl group, for example benzyl. The deprotection conditions for the above protecting groups will necessarily vary with the choice of protecting group. Thus, for example, an acyl group such as an alkanoyl or an aroyl group may be removed, for example, by hydrolysis with a suitable base such as an alkali metal hydroxide, for example lithium or sodium hydroxide. Alternatively an arylmethyl group such as a benzyl group may be removed, for example, by hydrogenation over a catalyst such as palladium-on-carbon.<br>
A suitable protecting group for a carboxy group is, for example, an esterifying group, for example a methyl or an ethyl group which may be removed, for example, by hydrolysis with a base such as sodium hydroxide, or for example a r-butyl group which may be removed, for example, by treatment with an acid, for example an organic acid such as trifluoroacetic acid, or for example a benzyl group which may be removed, for example, by hydrogenation over a catalyst such as palladium-on-carbon.<br>
The protecting groups may be removed at any convenient stage in the synthesis using conventional techniques well known in the chemical art.<br>
Certain intermediates in the preparation of a compound of the formula (1) are novel and form another aspect of the invention.<br>

The activity of the compounds is determined by measuring the inhibitory effect of the compounds in the direction of glycogen synthesis, the conversion of glucose-1-phosphate into glycogen with the release of inorganic phosphate, as described in EP 0 846 464 A2. The reactions were in 96well microplate format in a volume of 100^1. The change in optical<br><br>
density due to inorganic phosphate formation was measured at 620nM in a Labsystems iEMS Reader MF by the general method of (Nordlie R.C and Arion W.J, Methods of Enzymology, 1966,619-625). The reaction is in 50mM HEPES (N-(2-Hydroxyethyl)piperazine-N'-(2-ethanesulfonic acid);4-(2-Hydroxyethyl)piperazine-l-ethanesulfonic acid), 2.5mM MgCl2, 2.25mM ethylene glycol-bis(b-aminoethyl ether) N,N,N',N'-teK&amp;acetic acid, lOOmM KC1, 2mM D-(+)-glucose pH7.2, containing O.SmM dithiothreitol, the assay buffer solution, with O.lmg type IH glycogen, 0.15ug glycogen phosphorylase a (GPa) from rabbit muscle and O.SmM glucose-1-phosphate. GPa is pre-incubated in the assay buffer solution with the type ffl glycogen at 2.5 mg ml"1 for 30 minutes. 40ul of the enzyme solution is added to 25ul assay buffer solution and the reaction started with the addition of 25ul 2mM glucose-1-phosphate. Compounds to be tested are prepared in 10u,l 10% DMSO in assay buffer solution, with final concentration of 1% DMSO in the assay. The non-inhibited activity of GPa is measured in the presence of lOul 10% DMSO in assay buffer solution and maximum inhibition measured in the presence of 30}4M CP320626 (Hoover et al (1998) J Med Chem 41,2934-8; Martin et al (1998) PNAS 95,1776-81). The reaction is stopped after 30min with the addition of 50ul acidic ammonium molybdate solution, 12ug ml"1 in 3.48% H2SO4 with 1% sodium lauryl sulphate and lOug ml"1 ascorbic acid. After 30 minutes at room temperature the absorbency at 620nm is measured.<br>
The assay is performed at a test concentration of inhibitor of lOjiM or lOOpM. Compounds demonstrating significant inhibition at one or both of these concentrations may be further evaluated using a range of test concentrations of inhibitor to determine an ICso, a concentration predicted to inhibit the enzyme reaction by 50%.<br>
Activity is calculated as follows:-<br>
% inhibition = (1 - (compound OD620 - fully inhibited OD620)/ (non-inhibited rate OD620 -fully inhibited OD620)) * 100! OD620 = optical density at 620nM.<br>
Typical ICso values for compounds of the invention when tested in the above assay are in the range lOO^M to InM.<br>
The activity of the compounds is alternatively determined by measuring the inhibitory effect of the compounds on glycogen degradation, the production of glucose-1-phosphate from glycogen is monitored by the multienzyme coupled assay, as described in EP 0 846 464 A2, general method of Pesce et al (Pesce, M A, Bodourian, S H, Harris, R C, and Nicholson, J F<br><br>
 (1977) Clinical Chemistry 23,1171 -1717). The reactions were in 384well microplate format in a volume of 50ul. The change in fluorescence due to the conversion of the co-factor NAD to NADH is measured at 340nM excitation, 465nm emission in a Tecan Ultra Multifunctional Microplate Reader. The reaction is in 50mM HEPES, 3.5mM KH2PO4&gt; 2.5mM MgCl2, 2.5mM ethylene glycol-bis(b-aminoethyl ether) ?/,JV,//',2V'-tetraacetic acid, lOOmM KC1, 8mM D-(+)-glucose pH7.2, containing O.SmM dithiothreitol, the assay buffer solution. Human recombinant liver glycogen phosphorylase a (hrl GPa) 20nM is pre-incubated in assay buffer solution with 6.25mM NAD, 1.25mg type in glycogen at 1.25 mg ml"1 the reagent buffer, for 30 minutes. The coupling enzymes, phosphoglucomutase and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (Sigma) are prepared in reagent buffer, final concentration 0.25Units per well. 20pl of the hrl GPa solution is added to lOuJ compound solution and the reaction started with the addition of 20ul coupling enzyme solution. Compounds to be tested are prepared in 10|j,l 5% DMSO in assay buffer solution, with final concentration of 1% DMSO in the assay. The non-inhibited activity of GPa is measured in the presence of lOjil 5% DMSO in assay buffer solution and maximum inhibition measured in the presence of 5mgs ml"1 N-ethylmaleimide. After 6 hours at 30°C Relative Fluoresence Units (RFUs) are measured at 340nM excitation, 465nm emission,<br>
The assay is performed at a test concentration of inhibitor of lOpM or lOOuM. Compounds demonstrating significant inhibition at one or both of these concentrations may be further evaluated using a range of test concentrations of inhibitor to determine an ICso, a concentration predicted to inhibit the enzyme reaction by 50%.<br>
Activity is calculated as follows:-<br>
% inhibition = (1 - (compound RFUs - fully inhibited RFUs)/ (non-inhibited rate RFUs - fully inhibited RFUs)) * 100.<br>
Typical ICso values for compounds of the invention when tested in the above assay are in the range lOOpM to InM. For example, Example 14 gave an IC50 value of 2.1\M.<br>
The inhibitory activity of compounds was further tested in rat primary hepatocytes. Rat hepatocytes were isolated by the collagenase perfusion technique, general method of Seglen (P.O. Seglen, Methods Cell Biology (1976) 13 29-83). Cells were cultured on Nunclon six well culture plates in DMEM (Dulbeco's Modified Eagle's Medium) with high level of glucose containing 10% foetal calf serum, NEAA (non essential amino acids), Glutamine, penicillin /streptomycin ((100units/100ug)/ml) for 4 to 6 hours. The hepatocytes were then<br><br>
cultured in the DMEM solution without foetal calf serum and with lOnM insulin and lOnM dexamethasone. Experiments were initiated after 18-20 hours culture by washing the cells and adding Krebs-Henseleit bicarbonate buffer containing 2.5mM CaCk and 1% gelatin. The test compound was added and 5 minutes later the cells were challenged with 25nM glucagon. The Krebs-Henseleit solution was removed after 60 min incubation at 37°C , 95%O2/5%CO2 and the glucose concentration of the Krebs-Henseleit solution measured.<br>

HETEROCYCLIC AMIDE DERIVATIVES AS INHIBITORS OF GLYCOGEN PHOSPHORYLASE<br>
The present invention relates to heterocyclic amide derivatives, pharmaceutically acceptable salts and in vivo hydrolysable esters thereof. These heterocyclic amides possess glycogen phosphorylase inhibitory activity and accordingly have value in the treatment of disease states associated with increased glycogen phosphorylase activity and thus are potentially useful in methods of treatment of a warm-blooded animal such as man. The invention also relates to processes for the manufacture of said heterocyclic amide derivatives, to pharmaceutical compositions containing them and to their use in the manufacture of medicaments to inhibit glycogen phosphorylase activity in a warm-blooded animal such as man.<br>
The liver is the major organ regulating glycaemia in the post-absorptive state. Additionally, although having a smaller role in the contribution to post-prandial blood glucose levels, the response of the liver to exogenous sources of plasma glucose is key to an ability to maintain euglycaemia. An increased hepatic glucose output (HGO) is considered to play an important role in maintaining the elevated fasting plasma glucose (FPG) levels seen in type 2 diabetics; particularly those with a FPG &gt;140mg/dl (7.8mM). (Weyer et al, (1999), J Clin Invest 104: 787-794; Clore &amp; Blackgard (1994), Diabetes 43: 256-262; De Fronzo, R. A., et al, (1992) Diabetes Care 15; 318 - 355; Reaven, G.M. (1995) Diabetologia 38; 3-13).<br>
Since current oral, anti-diabetic therapies fail to bring FPG levels to within the normal, non-diabetic range and since raised FPG (and glycHbAlc) levels are risk factors for both macro- (Charles, M.A. et al (1996) Lancet 348,1657-1658; Coutinho, M. et al (1999) Diabetes Care 22; 233-240; Shaw, J.E. et al (2000) Diabetes Care 23, 34-39) and micro-vascular disease (DCCT Research Group (1993) New. Eng. J. Med. 329; 977-986); the reduction and normalisation of elevated FPG levels remains a treatment goal in type 2 DM.<br>
It has been estimated that, after an overnight fast, 74% of HGO was derived from glycogenolysis with the remainder derived from gluconeogenic precursors (Hellerstein et al (1997) Am J Physiol, 272: E163). Glycogen phosphorylase is a key enzyme in the generation by glycogenolysis of glucose-1-phosphate, and hence glucose in liver and also in other tissues such as muscle and neuronal tissue.<br>
Liver glycogen phosphorylase a activity is elevated in diabetic animal models including the db/db mouse and the fa/fa rat (Aiston S et al (2000). Diabetalogia 43, 589-597).<br><br>
Inhibition of hepatic glycogen phosphorylase with chloroindole inhibitors (CP91149 and CP320626) has been shown to reduce both glucagon stimulated glycogenolysis and glucose output in hepatocytes (Hoover et al (1998) J Med Chem 41, 2934-8; Martin et al (1998) PNAS 95,1776-81). Additionally, plasma glucose concentration is reduced, in a dose related manner, db/db and ob/ob mice following treatment with these compounds.<br>
Studies in conscious dogs with glucagon challenge in the absence and presence of another glycogen phosphorylase inhibitor, Bay K 3401, also show the potential utility of such agents where there is elevated circulating levels of glucagon, as in both Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes. In the presence of Bay R 3401, hepatic glucose output and arterial plasma glucose following a glucagon challenge were reduced significantly (Shiota et al, (1997), Am J Physiol, 273: E868).<br>
The heterocyclic amides of the present invention possess glycogen phosphorylase inhibitory activity and accordingly are expected to be of use in the treatment of type 2 diabetes, insulin resistance, syndrome X, hyperinsulinaemia, hyperglucagonaemia, cardiac ischaemia and obesity, particularly type 2 diabetes.<br>

Another aspect of the present invention provides a process for preparing a compound of formula (1) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or an in vivo hydrolysable ester thereof which process (wherein A, R1, R2, R3, R4, R5, n and — are, unless otherwise specified, as defined in formula (1)) comprises of: a) reacting an acid of the formula (2):<br>
(Figure Remove)<br><br><br><br>
or an activated derivative thereof; with an amine of formula (3):<br>
(Figure Remove)<br>
and thereafter if necessary:<br>
i) converting a compound of the formula (1) into another compound of the formula (1);<br>
ii) removing any protecting groups;<br>
iii) forming a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or in vivo hydrolysable ester.<br>
Specific reaction conditions for the above reaction are as follows.<br>
Process a)      Acids of formula (2) and amines of formula (3) may be coupled together in the presence of a suitable coupling reagent. Standard peptide coupling reagents known in the art can be employed as suitable coupling reagents, or for example carbonyldiimidazole, l-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodi-imide hydrochloride (EDO) and dicyclohexyl-carbodiimide (DCCI), optionally in the presence of a catalyst such as 1-hydroxybenzotriazole, dimethylaminopyridine or 4-pyrrolidinopyridine, optionally in the presence of a base for example triethylamine, di-isopropylethylamine, pyridine, or 2,6-di-alkyl-pvridines such as 2,6-lutidine or 2,6-di-tert-butylpyridine. Suitable solvents include dimethylacetamide, dichloromethane, benzene, tetrahydrofuran and dimethylformamide. The coupling reaction may conveniently be performed at a temperature in the range of-40 to 40°C.<br>
Suitable activated acid derivatives include acid halides, for example acid chlorides, and active esters, for example pentafluorophenyl esters. The reaction of these types of compounds with amines is well known in the art, for example they may be reacted in the presence of a base, such as those described above, and in a suitable solvent, such as those described above. The reaction may conveniently be performed at a temperature in the range of<br>
-40 to 40°C.<br>
Where R of formula (1) contains an ester group, the conversion of a compound of the formula (1) into another compound of the formula (1) may involve hydrolysis of the ester group, for example, acid or base hydrolysis, for example using lithium hydroxide. The reaction of this type is well known in the art.<br>
Substituted amides wherein R3 is CH2C(O)N(R9)(R10) may be prepared from the corresponding acids by a coupling reaction using the appropriate amine in the presence of a coupling reagent, for example EDCI. Alternatively, the acid may first be converted to a mixed anhydride, by reaction with, for example, ethyl chloroformate, which is reacted with an appropriate amine to produce the substituted amide. Substituted sulphonamides wherein R3 is CH2C(O)NHSO2Rg may be prepared similarly, for instance by coupling the compounds wherein R3 is CHaCOaH with the appropriate substituted sulphonamide in the presence of a coupling reagent, for example EDCI.<br>
Compounds of formula (1) wherein R3 is 2-hydroxyethyl may be prepared by reduction of the mixed anhydrides described above with, for example, lithium borohydride. Compounds of formula (1) wherein R3 is an oxadiazol-5-ylmethyl group may be prepared by reaction of the mixed anhydrides described above with an appropriately substituted hydroxyamidine, for example Ar-hydroxyethanimidamide, in the presence of a base such as N-methylmorpholine.<br>
Compounds of formula (1) wherein R3 is a tetrazol-5-yknethyl group may be prepared by reaction of the corresponding compounds where R3 is a cyanomethyl group with an azide, for example sodium azide, in the presence of an amine salt, for instance triethylamine hydrochloride. Compounds of formula (1) wherein R3 is 2-amino-2-(hydroxyimino)ethyl may be prepared by reaction of compounds wherein R3 is cyanomethyl with hydroxylamine hydrochloride in the presence of a base, for example sodium methoxide.<br>
Compounds of formula (1) wherein R3 is a 2-(methylsulphonyl)ethyl or 2-(methylsulphinyl)ethyl group may be prepared by reaction of the corresponding compounds where R3 is 2-methylthioethyl with an oxidising agent, for example oxone.<br>
Compounds of formula (1) wherein R3 is a dihydroxyalkyl group, for example 2,3-dihydroxypropyl or 2-(hydroxymethyl)-3-hydroxypropyl may be prepared by acid hydrolysis of the corresponding compounds of formula (1) wherein R3 is a protected dihydroxyalkyl<br>
group for example (2,2-dimethyl-l,3-dioxan-5-yl)methyl, (2,2-dimethyl-l,3-dioxolan-4-yl)methyl or (2-oxo-l,3-dioxan-5-yl)methyl.<br>
The acids of formula (2), wherein X is CH, may be prepared according to Scheme 1:<br>
(Figure Remove)<br>
Compounds of formula (2a) are commercially available or they are known compounds or they are prepared by processes known in the art.<br>
The acids of the formula (2), wherein X is N, can be prepared from a compound of the formula (6):<br><br>
(Figure Remove)<br>
by firstly converting the oxo group to chlorine or bromine with a halogenating agent such as POC13 or POBra, in an inert organic solvent such as dichloromethane in a temperature range of ambient temperature to reflux (for example see Nucleic Acid Chem. 1991,4, 24-6), then displacing the chlorine or bromine group with cyanide using a cyanide salt such as potassium cyanide, in an inert organic solvent such as toluene, benzene or xylene, optionally in the presence of a catalyst such as 18-crown-6 (for example see J. Heterocycl. Chem 2000,37(1). 119-126) and finally hydrolysing the cyano group to a carboxy group, with for example, an aqueous acid such as aqueous hydrogen chloride (for example see Chem. Pharm. Butt. 1986, 34(9). 3635-43).<br>
Alternatively, a compound of the formula (2) wherein X is N may be formed by reacting the compound of the formula (6) with (CkCCO^O and ClaCCC^H in the presence of magnesium chloride using ClaCCOiH as solvent, to form a compound of the formula (7):<br>
(Figure Remove)<br>
and then hydrolyising the compound of the formula (7), using, for example, aqueous sodium hydroxide, at a temperature range of ambient temperature to reflux (for example see J Heterocyd. Chem. 1980,17(2), 381-2).<br>
The compound of formula (6) may be prepared from a compound of formula (12) and (13) using conditions known for the Curtius rearrangement tetrahedron 1999, 55,6167):<br>
(Figure Remove)<br>
The compounds of the formula (10) and (11): R4<br><br>
(Figure Remove)<br>
transform into compounds of the formula (12) and (13) respectively. This transformation either occurs spontaneously or may be induced with acid or base.<br>
(Figure Remove)<br>
Compounds of the formula (10) and (11) may be prepared by introducing a carboxy group into a compound of the formula (8) or (9):<br>
wherein P' is an amino protecting group such as butoxycarbonyl.<br>
A carboxy group is introduced into the compound of the formula (8) or (9) by reacting an alkyl lithium reagent such as n-butyl lithium, in an inert organic solvent such as THF, at<br>
-50-low temperature, for example in the range -10°C to -78°C and then forming the compound of the formula (10) or (11) as appropriate by either<br>
a)	reacting the resulting compound with carbon dioxide; or<br>
b)	by reacting with DMF in the temperature range of -10°C to ambient temperature to<br>
form the corresponding aldehyde and oxidizing the aldehyde to carboxy with standard<br>
reagents to give the compound of the formula (10) or (11).<br>
Compounds of the formula (8) and (9) may be prepared from a compound of the formula (14) and (15): <br>
(Figure Remove)<br>
(14) using conditions known for the Curtius reaction.<br>
Compounds of the formula (14) and (15) may be prepared by oxidizing the corresponding aldehyde using standard oxidizing reagents such as potassium manganate or sodium periodate.<br>
The aldehyde precursor of a compound of the formula (14) or (15) can be prepared using standard techniques known in the art. For example, many compounds of the formula (14) or (15) may be prepared by introducing the appropriate R6 and R7 into a compound of the formula (16) or (17) as appropriate:<br>
(Figure Remove)<br>
For example, when R6 and R7 are both chloro a compound of the formula (16) or (17) may be chlorinated with a chlorinating agent such as chlorine in the presence of aluminium chloride or iron (ffi) chloride, in an inert organic chlorinated solvent such as dichloromethane or 1,2-dichloroethane, followed by treatment with an aqueous base, such as, aqueous sodium hydroxide. The mono chlorinated compound can be formed in the same way.<br>
-51-Compounds of formula (3) may be prepared by reacting an amine of formula (4)<br><br>
(Figure Remove)<br>
with R3-L where L is a suitable leaving group (for example chloro, bromo or iodo) in the presence of a base such as sodium hydride in a suitable solvent.<br>
Compounds of the fonnula (4) wherein A is phenylene and	is a single bond<br>
may be made from 3-amino-3,4-dihydroquinolin-2-(lH)-one hydrochloride (J. Med. Chem.,<br><br>
28,1985,1511-16). Compounds of the formula (4) wherein A is phenylene and	is a<br>
double bond may be prepared by the reductive cyclisation of a compound of fonnula (18), using for example tin (II) chloride in hydrochloric acid, followed by removal of the Boc protecting group, using for example trifluoroacetic acid. Compounds of formula (18) may be prepared by reaction of compounds of formula (19) by reaction with a compound of formula (20) in the presence of a base, for example tetramethylguanidine. Compounds of fonnula (19) are commercially available or described in the literature.<br>
Compounds of the formula (4) wherein A is heterocyclylene can be prepared from cyclisation of suitably functionalised heterocycles. For example, when A is pyridine,<br>
(Figure Remove)<br>
compounds of fonnula (4a) and (4b) may be prepared from an appropriately substituted nitro-methyl pyridine or amino-pyridine according to the Schemes 2 and 3:-<br>
(Figure Remove)<br>
Steps 1 and 2 may be carried out by the process described in Tetrahedron 1998,54(23), 6311-<br>
6318.<br>
Step 3 may be carried out by the method described in Synthesis 1992 (5) ,487<br>
Assymetric hydrogenation reactions of olefins as shown in Step 4 are well known (see for<br>
example, SACS 1993,115,10125-10138) and lead to homochiral final products.<br>
Step 5 may alternatively be carried out by hydrolysing the ester and activating the resulting<br>
acid with a carbodiimide such as EDCI or DCCI, or by preparing an acid chloride, or<br>
activated ester such as an N -hydroxysuccinimide ester. Suitable bases are organic base such<br>
as triethylamine or di-isopropylethylamine (DJDPEA) or l,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene<br>
(DBU).<br>
In Step 6 X is a leaving group, for example Cl, Br, I, OMesyl. In Step 7 alternative solvents such as dichloromethane or other acids such as trifluoroacetic acid can be used.<br>
using conditions known for the Mitsunobu reaction (Bull. Chem. Soc. Jpn., 1967,40,2380). Compounds of the formula (23) and (24) are commercially available.<br>
Compounds of formula (2b) may also be prepared as illustrated in Scheme 4:<br>
 (Figure Remove)<br>
The conversion of compounds of formula (8) into compounds of formula (25) may be carried out by directed ortho lithiation reactions (J. Org. Chem, 2001, volume 66, 3662-3670), for example with n-butyl lithium and (CHO)N(alkyl)2. The protecting group P' in compounds of formula (8) must be suitable directing group for this reaction and may be for example -CO2tfiu. Reaction of compounds of formula (25) with LCI^CC^R where L is a leaving group, and replacement of the protecting group P' with an alternative P" (for example -COalkyl) according to standard processes, gives a compound of formula (26). This may be cyclised using a base, for example potassium carbonate or sodium methoxide.<br>
Compounds of the formula (4) wherein A is heteroarylene and there is a bridgehead heteroatom, for example, compounds of the formula (4d) may be made by analogous chemistry to that shown for making compounds of the formula (4c).<br>

It will be appreciated that certain of the various ring substituents in the compounds of the present invention, for example R1, may be introduced by standard aromatic substitution reactions or generated by conventional functional group modifications either prior to or<br><br>
immediately following the processes mentioned above, and as such are included in the process aspect of the invention. Such reactions may convert one compound of the formula (1) into another compound of the formula (1). Such reactions and modifications include, for example, introduction of a substituent by means of an aromatic substitution reaction, reduction of substituents, alkylation of substituents and oxidation of substituents. The reagents and reaction conditions for such procedures are well known in the chemical art. Particular examples of aromatic substitution reactions include the introduction of a nitro group using concentrated nitric acid, the introduction of an acyl group using, for example, an acyl halide and Lewis acid (such as aluminium trichloride) under Friedel Crafts conditions; the introduction of an alkyl group using an alkyl halide and Lewis acid (such as aluminium trichloride) under Friedel Crafts conditions; and the introduction of a halogen group. Particular examples of modifications include the reduction of a nitro group to an amino group by for example, catalytic hydrogenation with a nickel catalyst or treatment with iron in the presence of hydrochloric acid with heating; oxidation of alkylthio to alkylsulphinyl or alkylsulphonyl.<br>
It will also be appreciated that in some of the reactions mentioned herein it may be necessary/desirable to protect any sensitive groups in the compounds. The instances where protection is necessary or desirable and suitable methods for protection are known to those skilled in the art. Conventional protecting groups may be used in accordance with standard practice (for illustration see T.W. Green, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, John Wiley and Sons, 1991). Thus, if reactants include groups such as amino, carboxy or hydroxy it may be desirable to protect the group in some of the reactions mentioned herein.<br>
A suitable protecting group for an amino or alkylamino group is, for example, an acyl group, for example an alkanoyl group such as acetyl, an alkoxycarbonyl group, for example a methoxycarbonyl, ethoxycarbonyl or r-butoxycarbonyl group, an arylmethoxycarbonyl group, for example benzyloxycarbonyl, or an aroyl group, for example benzoyl. The deprotection conditions for the above protecting groups necessarily vary with the choice of protecting group. Thus, for example, an acyl group such as an alkanoyl or alkoxycarbonyl group or an aroyl group may be removed for example, by hydrolysis with a suitable base such as an alkali metal hydroxide, for example lithium or sodium hydroxide. Alternatively an acyl group such as a f-butoxycarbonyl group may be removed, for example, by treatment with a suitable acid as hydrochloric, sulphuric or phosphoric acid or trifluoroacetic acid and an<br><br>
arylmethoxycarbonyl group such as a benzyloxycarbonyl group may be removed, for example, by hydrogenation over a catalyst such as palladium-on-carbon, or by treatment with a Lewis acid for example boron tris(trifluoroacetate). A suitable alternative protecting group for a primary ammo group is, for example, a phthaloyl group which may be removed by treatment with an alkylamine, for example dimethylaminopropylamine, or with hydrazine.<br>
A suitable protecting group for a hydroxy group is, for example, an acyl group, for example an alkanoyl group such as acetyl, an aroyl group, for example benzoyl, or an arylmethyl group, for example benzyl. The deprotection conditions for the above protecting groups will necessarily vary with the choice of protecting group. Thus, for example, an acyl group such as an alkanoyl or an aroyl group may be removed, for example, by hydrolysis with a suitable base such as an alkali metal hydroxide, for example lithium or sodium hydroxide. Alternatively an arylmethyl group such as a benzyl group may be removed, for example, by hydrogenation over a catalyst such as palladium-on-carbon.<br>
A suitable protecting group for a carboxy group is, for example, an esterifying group, for example a methyl or an ethyl group which may be removed, for example, by hydrolysis with a base such as sodium hydroxide, or for example a r-butyl group which may be removed, for example, by treatment with an acid, for example an organic acid such as trifluoroacetic acid, or for example a benzyl group which may be removed, for example, by hydrogenation over a catalyst such as palladium-on-carbon.<br>
The protecting groups may be removed at any convenient stage in the synthesis using conventional techniques well known in the chemical art.<br>
Certain intermediates in the preparation of a compound of the formula (1) are novel and form another aspect of the invention.<br>
As stated hereinbefore the compounds defined in the present invention possesses glycogen phosphorylase inhibitory activity. This property may be assessed, for example, using the procedure set out below.<br>
Assay<br>
The activity of the compounds is determined by measuring the inhibitory effect of the compounds in the direction of glycogen synthesis, the conversion of glucose-1-phosphate into glycogen with the release of inorganic phosphate, as described in EP 0 846 464 A2. The reactions were in 96well microplate format in a volume of 100^1. The change in optical<br><br>
density due to inorganic phosphate formation was measured at 620nM in a Labsystems iEMS Reader MF by the general method of (Nordlie R.C and Arion W.J, Methods of Enzymology, 1966,619-625). The reaction is in 50mM HEPES (N-(2-Hydroxyethyl)piperazine-N'-(2-ethanesulfonic acid);4-(2-Hydroxyethyl)piperazine-l-ethanesulfonic acid), 2.5mM MgCl2, 2.25mM ethylene glycol-bis(b-aminoethyl ether) N,N,N',N'-teK&amp;acetic acid, lOOmM KC1, 2mM D-(+)-glucose pH7.2, containing O.SmM dithiothreitol, the assay buffer solution, with O.lmg type IH glycogen, 0.15ug glycogen phosphorylase a (GPa) from rabbit muscle and O.SmM glucose-1-phosphate. GPa is pre-incubated in the assay buffer solution with the type ffl glycogen at 2.5 mg ml"1 for 30 minutes. 40ul of the enzyme solution is added to 25ul assay buffer solution and the reaction started with the addition of 25ul 2mM glucose-1-phosphate. Compounds to be tested are prepared in 10u,l 10% DMSO in assay buffer solution, with final concentration of 1% DMSO in the assay. The non-inhibited activity of GPa is measured in the presence of lOul 10% DMSO in assay buffer solution and maximum inhibition measured in the presence of 30}4M CP320626 (Hoover et al (1998) J Med Chem 41,2934-8; Martin et al (1998) PNAS 95,1776-81). The reaction is stopped after 30min with the addition of 50ul acidic ammonium molybdate solution, 12ug ml"1 in 3.48% H2SO4 with 1% sodium lauryl sulphate and lOug ml"1 ascorbic acid. After 30 minutes at room temperature the absorbency at 620nm is measured.<br>
The assay is performed at a test concentration of inhibitor of lOjiM or lOOpM. Compounds demonstrating significant inhibition at one or both of these concentrations may be further evaluated using a range of test concentrations of inhibitor to determine an ICso, a concentration predicted to inhibit the enzyme reaction by 50%.<br>
Activity is calculated as follows:-<br>
% inhibition = (1 - (compound OD620 - fully inhibited OD620)/ (non-inhibited rate OD620 -fully inhibited OD620)) * 100! OD620 = optical density at 620nM.<br>
Typical ICso values for compounds of the invention when tested in the above assay are in the range lOO^M to InM.<br>
The activity of the compounds is alternatively determined by measuring the inhibitory effect of the compounds on glycogen degradation, the production of glucose-1-phosphate from glycogen is monitored by the multienzyme coupled assay, as described in EP 0 846 464 A2, general method of Pesce et al (Pesce, M A, Bodourian, S H, Harris, R C, and Nicholson, J F<br><br>
 (1977) Clinical Chemistry 23,1171 -1717). The reactions were in 384well microplate format in a volume of 50ul. The change in fluorescence due to the conversion of the co-factor NAD to NADH is measured at 340nM excitation, 465nm emission in a Tecan Ultra Multifunctional Microplate Reader. The reaction is in 50mM HEPES, 3.5mM KH2PO4&gt; 2.5mM MgCl2, 2.5mM ethylene glycol-bis(b-aminoethyl ether) ?/,JV,//',2V'-tetraacetic acid, lOOmM KC1, 8mM D-(+)-glucose pH7.2, containing O.SmM dithiothreitol, the assay buffer solution. Human recombinant liver glycogen phosphorylase a (hrl GPa) 20nM is pre-incubated in assay buffer solution with 6.25mM NAD, 1.25mg type in glycogen at 1.25 mg ml"1 the reagent buffer, for 30 minutes. The coupling enzymes, phosphoglucomutase and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (Sigma) are prepared in reagent buffer, final concentration 0.25Units per well. 20pl of the hrl GPa solution is added to lOuJ compound solution and the reaction started with the addition of 20ul coupling enzyme solution. Compounds to be tested are prepared in 10|j,l 5% DMSO in assay buffer solution, with final concentration of 1% DMSO in the assay. The non-inhibited activity of GPa is measured in the presence of lOjil 5% DMSO in assay buffer solution and maximum inhibition measured in the presence of 5mgs ml"1 N-ethylmaleimide. After 6 hours at 30°C Relative Fluoresence Units (RFUs) are measured at 340nM excitation, 465nm emission,<br>
The assay is performed at a test concentration of inhibitor of lOpM or lOOuM. Compounds demonstrating significant inhibition at one or both of these concentrations may be further evaluated using a range of test concentrations of inhibitor to determine an ICso, a concentration predicted to inhibit the enzyme reaction by 50%.<br>
Activity is calculated as follows:-<br>
% inhibition = (1 - (compound RFUs - fully inhibited RFUs)/ (non-inhibited rate RFUs - fully inhibited RFUs)) * 100.<br>
Typical ICso values for compounds of the invention when tested in the above assay are in the range lOOpM to InM. For example, Example 14 gave an IC50 value of 2.1\M.<br>
The inhibitory activity of compounds was further tested in rat primary hepatocytes. Rat hepatocytes were isolated by the collagenase perfusion technique, general method of Seglen (P.O. Seglen, Methods Cell Biology (1976) 13 29-83). Cells were cultured on Nunclon six well culture plates in DMEM (Dulbeco's Modified Eagle's Medium) with high level of glucose containing 10% foetal calf serum, NEAA (non essential amino acids), Glutamine, penicillin /streptomycin ((100units/100ug)/ml) for 4 to 6 hours. The hepatocytes were then<br><br>
cultured in the DMEM solution without foetal calf serum and with lOnM insulin and lOnM dexamethasone. Experiments were initiated after 18-20 hours culture by washing the cells and adding Krebs-Henseleit bicarbonate buffer containing 2.5mM CaCk and 1% gelatin. The test compound was added and 5 minutes later the cells were challenged with 25nM glucagon. The Krebs-Henseleit solution was removed after 60 min incubation at 37°C , 95%O2/5%CO2 and the glucose concentration of the Krebs-Henseleit solution measured.<br>
