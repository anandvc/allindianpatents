The present invention relates to herbicidally active compositions comprising 3-phenyluracils of formula I, 3-sulfonylisoxazolines of formula II and optionally at least one safener of formula III.<br>
In crop protection products, it is desirable in principle to increase the specificity and the reliability of the action of active compounds. In particular, it is desirable for the crop protection product to control the harmful plants effectively and, at the same time, to be tolerated by the useful plants in question.<br>
Various publications have described both 3-phenyluracils I and 3-sulfonylisoxazolines II as being highly effective herbicides. However, their compatibility with dicotyledonous crop plants such as cotton, oilseed rape and some graminaceous plants such as bar¬ley, millet, corn, rice, wheat and sugar cane is not always satisfactory, i.e. in addition to the harmful plants, the crop plants are also damaged to an extent which is not accept¬able. It is possible to spare the useful plants by lowering the application rates; however the extent of the control of harmful plants is naturally also reduced.<br>
It is known that certain combinations of different herbicides with specific action result in an enhanced activity of a herbicide component by synergism. As a consequence, It Is possible to reduce the application rates of herbicidally active compounds required for controlling the harmful plants.<br>
Furthermore, it is known that in some cases better crop plant compatibility can be achieved by joint application of specifically acting herbicides with organic active com¬pounds, some of which are themselves herbicidally active. In these cases, the acitive compounds act as antidote or antagonist, and, owing to the fact that they can reduce or even prevent damage to the crop plants, they are also referred to as safeners.<br><br>
and their agriculturally acceptable salts are disclosed in the earlier patent application WO 01/83459. Certain herbicidal compositions of 3-phenyluracils of formula I are dis-closed in the earlier patent applications WO 03/24221 and WO 04/80183.<br><br>
2<br>
3-Sulfonylisoxazolines of formula II<br><br>
are disclosed in the earlier patent applications JP 09/328 483, WO 01/12613, WO 02/62770, WO 03/00686, WO 03/10165 and JP 2005/35924.<br>
Certain herbicidal compositions of 3-sulfonylisoxazolines of formula II are disclosed in the earlier patent applications JP 2004/002324 and WO 04/14138.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to increase the herbicidal activity of 3-phenyluracils of formula I and 3-sulfonylisoxazolines of formula II against undesirable harmful plants and to improve simultaneously their compatibility with useful plants.<br>
We have found that this object is achieved, surprisingly, by compositions comprising a)     at ieast one 3-phenyluracil of formula I<br><br>

In the ready-to-use preparations, i.e. in the compositions according to the invention in the form of crop protection products, the components I and II and optionally III, in sus¬pended, emulsified or dissolved form, can be present formulated jointly or separately. The use forms depend entirely on the intended use.<br>
The compositions according to the invention can be applied, for example, in the form of directly sprayable aqueous solutions, powders, suspensions, also highly-concentrated aqueous, oily or other suspensions or dispersions, emulsions, oil dispersions, pastes, dusts, materials for spreading or granules, by means of spraying, atomizing, dusting, broadcasting or watering. The use forms depend on the intended use; in any case, they should ensure the finest possible distribution of the active compounds.<br>
Depending on the form in which the ready-to-use preparations are present in the com-positions according to the invention, they comprise one or more liquid or solid carriers, if appropriate surfactants and if appropriate further auxiliaries which are customary for<br><br>
formulating crop protection products. The person skilled in the art is sufficiently familiar with the recipes for such formulations.<br>
The ready-to-use preparations comprise the components I and II and optionally III and auxiliaries which are customary for formulating crop protection products, which auxilia¬ries may also comprise a liquid carrier.<br>
Suitable inert additives with carrier function are essentially: mineral oil fractions of me¬dium to high boiling point, such as kerosene and diesel oil, furthermore coal tar oils and oils of vegetable or animal origin, aliphatic, cyclic.and aromatic hydrocarbons, e.g. par¬affins, tetrahydronaphthalerie, alkylated naphthalenes and their derivatives, alkylated benzenes and their derivatives, alcohols such as methanol, ethanol, propanol, butanol and cyclohexanol, ketones such as cyclohexanone, strongly polar solvents, e.g. amines such as N-methylpyrrolidone, and water.<br>
Aqueous use forms can be prepared from emulsion concentrates, suspensions, pastes, wettable powders or water-dispersible granules by adding water. To prepare emul¬sions, pastes or oil dispersions, the active compounds I, II or III, as such or dissolved in an oil or solvent, can be homogenized in water by means of wetting agent, tackifier, dispersant or emulsifier. Alternatively, it is possible to prepare concentrates consisting of active substance, wetting agent, tackifier, dispersant or emulsifier and, if desired, solvent or oil, and these concentrates are suitable for dilution with water.<br>
Suitable surfactants are the alkali metal salts, alkaline earth metal salts and ammonium salts of aromatic sulfonic acids, e.g. ligno-, phenol-, naphthalene- and dibutylnaphtha-lenesulfonic acid, and of fatty acids, of alkyl- and alkylarylsulfonates, of alkyl sulfates, lauryl ether sulfates and fatty alcohol sulfates, and salts of sulfated hexa-, hepta- and octadecanols and of fatty alcohol glycol ethers, condensates of sulfonated naphthalene and its derivatives with formaldehyde, condensates of naphthalene or of the naphtha-lenesulfonic acids with phenol and formaldehyde, polyoxyethylene octylphenol ether, ethoxylated isooctyl-, octyl- or nonylphenol, alkylphenyl polyglycol ethers, tributylphenyl polyglycol ether, alkylaryl polyether alcohols, isotridecyl alcohol, fatty alcohol/ethylene oxide condensates, ethoxylated castor oil, polyoxyethylene alkyl ether or polyoxypro-pylene alkyl ether, lauryl alcohol polyglycol ether acetate, sorbitol esters, lignosulfite waste liquors or methylcellulose.<br>
Powders, materials for spreading and dusts can be prepared by mixing or concomitant grinding of the active substances with a solid carrier.<br>
Granules, e.g. coated granules, impregnated granules and homogeneous granules, can be prepared by binding the active ingredients to solid carriers. Solid carriers are mineral earths such as silicas, silica gels, silicates, talc, kaolin, limestone, lime, chalk,<br><br>
bole, loess, clay, dolomite, diatomaceous earth, calcium sulfate, magnesium sulfate, magnesium oxide, ground synthetic materials, fertilizers such as ammonium sulfate, ammonium phosphate, ammonium nitrate, ureas, and products of vegetable origin such as cereal meal, tree bark meal, wood meal and nutshell meal, cellulose powders, or other solid carriers.<br>
The concentrations of the active compounds in the ready-to-use preparations can be varied within wide ranges. In general, the formulations comprise from 0.001 to 98% by weight, preferably 0.01 to 95% by weight, of active ingredients. The active ingredients are employed in a purity of from 90% to 100%, preferably 95% to 100% (according to N MR spectrum).<br>
The compounds according to the invention can, for example, be formulated as follows:<br>
I	20 parts by weight of the active compound composition in question are dissolved in a composition composed of 80 parts by weight of alkylated benzene, 10 parts by weight of the adduct of 8 to 10 mol of ethylene oxide to 1 mol of oleic acid N-monoethanolamide, 5 parts by weight of calcium dodecylbenzenesulfonate<and parts by weight of the adduct mol ethylene oxide tp castor oil. pouring solution into water and finely distributing it therein gives an aqueous dispersion which comprises ac ingredient.></and>

Pouring the solution into 100 000 parts by weight of water and finely distributing it therein gives an aquebus dispersion which comprises 0.02% by weight of the active ingredient.<br>
III	20 parts by weight of the active compound composition in question are dissolved in a composition composed of 25 parts by weight of cyclohexanone, 65 parts by weight of a mineral oil fraction of boiling point 210 to 280°C and 10 parts by weight of the adduct of 40 mol of ethylene oxide to 1 mol of castor oil. Pouring the solution into 100 000 parts by weight of water and finely distributing it therein gives an aqueous dispersion which comprises 0.02% by weight of the active in¬gredient.<br>
IV	20 parts by weight of the active compound composition in question are mixed thoroughly with 3 parts by weight of sodium diisobutylnaphthalenesulfonate, 17 parts by weight of the sodium salt of a lignosulfonic acid from a sulfite waste liq-<br><br>
uor and 60 parts by weight of pulverulent silica gel, and the composition is ground in a hammer mill. Finely distributing the composition in 20 000 parts by weight of water gives a spray composition which comprises 0.1% by weight of the active ingredient.<br>
V	3 parts by weight of the active compound composition in question are mixed with<br>
97 parts by weight of finely divided kaolin. This gives a dust which comprises 3%<br>
by weight of the active ingredient.<br>
VI	20 parts by weight of the active compound composition in question are mixed intimately with 2 parts by weight of calcium dodecylbenzenesulfonate, 8 parts by weight of fatty alcohol polyglycol ether, 2 parts by weight of the sodium salt of a phenol-urea-formaldehyde condensate and 68 parts by weight of a paraffinic mineral oil. This gives a stable oily dispersion.<br>
VII	1 part by weight of the active compound composition in question is dissolved in a composition composed of 70 parts by weight of cyclohexanone, 20 parts by weight of ethoxylated isboctylphenol and 10 parts by weight of ethoxylated castor oil. This gives a stable emulsion concentrate.<br>
VIII	1 part by weight of the active compound composition in question is dissolved in a composition composed of 80 parts by weight of cyclohexanone and 20 parts by weight of Wettol6 EM 31 (nonionic emulsifier based on ethoxylated castor oil). This gives a stable emulsion concentrate.<br>
The components I and II and optionally III can be formulated jointly or separately.<br>
The components I and II and optionally III can be applied jointly or separately, simulta¬neously or successively, before, during or after emergence of the plants.<br>
If the active compounds I and II and optionally III are less well tolerated by certain crop plants, it is possible to use application methods in which the herbicidal compositions are sprayed with the aid of sprayers in such a way that the leaves of the sensitive crop plants are as far as possible unaffected, whereas the active compounds reach the leaves of the undesirable plants growing underneath or the uncovered soil surface (post-directed, lay-by).<br>
The required application rate of the composition of the pure active compounds, i.e. of I and II and optionally III without formulation auxiliary, depends on the density of the un-desired vegetation, on the development stage of the plants, on the climatic conditions of the location where the composition is used and on the application method. In gen-<br><br>
eral, the application rate of I and II and optionally III is from 0.001 to 3 kg/ha, preferably from 0.005 to 2 kg/ha and in particular from 0.01 to 1 kg/ha of active substance.<br>
The required application rates of the 3-phenyluracils I and 3-sulfonylisoxazolines II are generally in the range from 0.1 g/ha to 1 kg/ha and preferably in the range from 1 g/ha to 500 g/ha or from 5 g/ha to 500 g/ha of active substance.<br>
The compositions are applied to the plants mainly by spraying, in particular foliar spray¬ing. Application can be carried out by customary spraying techniques using, for exam¬ple, water as carrier and spray liquor rates of from about 100 to 1 000 l/ha (for example from 300 to 400 l/ha). Application of the herbicidal compositions by the low-volume and the ultra-low-volume method is possible, as is their application in the form of micro-granules.<br>
The compositions according to the present invention are suitable for controlling com¬mon harmful plants in useful plants, in particular in crops such as wheat, barley, oats, cereals, corn, soybean, sorghum, rice, oilseed rape, cotton, potatoes, dry beans, groundnuts, preferably crops of cereals, corn, soybeans, rice, oilseed rape, cotton, po¬tatoes, groundnuts; more preferably cereals, corn, soybeans or rice; or in perennial crops. In another embodiment of the Invention, they are useful for controlling the whole vegetation, i. e. they act as a total weedkiller. Futhermore, in another emodiment of the present invention, the compositions are useful for controlling undesirable vegetation in forestry.<br>
Moreover, it may be useful to apply the compositions according to the invention jointly as a composition with other crop protection products, for example with pesticides or agents for controlling phytopathogenic fungi or bacteria. Also of interest is the miscibii-ity with mineral salt solutions which are employed for treating nutritional and trace ele¬ment deficiencies. Non-phytotoxic oils and oil concentrates may also be added.<br>
The compositions according to the invention can also be used in crop plants which are resistant to one or more herbicides owing to genetic engineering or breeding, which are resistant to one or more fungicides owing to genetic engineering or breeding, or which are resistant to attack by insects owing to genetic engineering or breeding. Suitable are for example crop plants, preferably corn, wheat, barley, sunflower, rice, canola, soy¬beans, which are resistant to herbicidal EPSP synthase inhibitors, such as, for exam¬ple, glyphosate, to herbicidal glutamine synthase inhibitors, such as, for example, glu-fosinate, to herbicidal protoporphyrinogen-IX oxidase inhibitors, such as, for example, butafenacil, or to herbicidal ALS inhibitors, such as, for example, imazamethabenz, imazamox, imazapic, imazapyr, imazaquin, imazethapyr, or crop plants which, owing to introduction of the gene for Bt toxin by genetic modification, are resistant to attack by certain insects.<br><br>
Surprisingly, the compositions according to the invention which comprise at least one 3-phenyluracil of formula I and at least one sulfonylisoxazoline of formula II have better herbicidal activity against harmful plants than would have been expected by the herbi¬cidal activity of the individual compounds. In other words, the joint action of 3-phenyluracils of formula I and sulfonylisoxazolines of formula II results in an enhanced activity against harmful plants in the sense of a synergy effect (synergism). For this reason, the compositions can, based on the individual components, be used at lower application rates to achieve a herbicidal effect comparable to the individual compo¬nents.<br>
Surprisingly, the compositions according to the invention which, in addition to the 3-phenyluracil of formula I and the sulfonylisoxazoline of formula II, comprise a safener of formula III are better tolerated by useful plants than the respective composition of 3-phenyluracil I and sulfonylisoxazoline II without safener III.<br>
The 3-phenyluracils of formula I can be prepared by the preparation processes dis¬closed by the earlier application WO 2001/83459. With respect to the preparation of individual compounds, reference is made to the examples of WO 2001/83459. Com¬pounds which are not explicitly disclosed in this document can be prepared in an analogous manner.<br>
The 3-sulfonylisoxazolines of formula II can be prepared by the preparation processes disclosed by the earlier applications JP 09/328 483, WO 01/12613, WO 02/62770, WO 03/00686, WO 03/10165, WO 04/13106, WO 04/14138 and JP 2005/35924. With re¬spect to the preparation of individual compounds, reference is made to the examples of the quoted patent applications. Compounds which are not explicitly disclosed in this document can be prepared in an analogous manner.<br>
Use Examples<br>
The effect of the herbicidal compositions according to the invention of components I and II and, if appropriate, III on the growth of undesirable plants compared to the herbi-cidally active compounds alone was demonstrated by the following greenhouse ex¬periments:<br>
For the pre-emergence treatment, directly after sowing the active compounds, which had been suspended or emulsified in water, were applied by means of finely distributed nozzles. The containers were irrigated gently to promote germination and growth and subsequently covered with transparent plastic hoods until plant had rooted. This cover caused uniform germination of the tests plants, unless this was adversely affected by active compounds.<br><br>
For the post-emergence treatment, the test plants were first grown to a height of 3 to 20 cm, depending on the piant habit, and only then treated. Here, the herbicidal com¬positions were suspended or emulsified in water as distribution medium and sprayed using finely distributing nozzles.<br>
The respective components I and II and/or III were formulated as 10% by weight strength emulsion concentrate and introduced to the spray liquor with the amount of solvent system used for applying the active compound. In the examples, the solvent used was water.<br>
The test period extended over 21 days. During this time, the plants were tended, and their response to the treatments with active compound was evaluated.<br>
The evaluation for the damage caused by the chemical compositions was carried out using a scale from 0 to 100%, compared to the untreated control plants. Here, 0 means no damage and 100 means complete destruction of the plants.<br>
The value E, which is to be expected if the activity of the individual compounds is just additive, was calculated using the method of S. R. Colby (1967) "Calculating synergis¬tic and antagonistic responses of herbicide combinations", Weeds 15, p. 22 ff.<br><br>
where	X =. effect in percent using 3-phenyluracil I at an application rate a;<br>
Y = effect in percent using 3-sulfonylisoxazoline II at an application rate b;<br>
E -  expected effect (in %) of I + II at application rates a + b.<br>
If the value observed in this manner is higher than the value E calculated according to Colby, a synergistic effect is present.<br>
