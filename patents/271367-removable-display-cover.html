REMOVABLE DISPLAY COVER BACKGROUND<br>
[0001] The present disclosure relates generally to information handling systems, and more particularly to a removable display cover for use with an information handling system.<br>
[0002] As the value and use of information continues to increase, individuals and businesses seek additional ways to process and store information. One option is an information handling system (IMS). An IMS generally processes, compiles, stores, and/or communicates information or data for business, personal, or other purposes. Because technology and information handling needs and requirements may vary between different applications, IHSs may also vary regarding what information is handled, how the information is handled, how much information is processed, stored, or communicated, and how quickly and efficiently the information may be processed, stored, or communicated. The variations in IHSs allow for IHSs to be general or configured for a specific user or specific use such as financial transaction processing, airline reservations, enterprise data storage, or global communications. In addition, IHSs may include a variety of hardware and software components that may be configured to process, store, and communicate information and may include one or more computer systems, data storage systems, and networking systems.<br>
[0003] In some instances, it may be desirable to provide for the personalization of an IHS to a user. For some users, customizing the IHS to their tastes may be a major selling point o'f a particular IHS. However, providing such personalization may be problematic, as IHS manufacturers tend to manufacture IHSs in high volume, which can make such personalization costly.<br>
[0004] For example, an area on most portable IHSs that lends itself to personalization is the display cover, which offers a large, mostly unused space that is visible when the IHS is both in<br>
use and not in use. However, the personalization of such display covers raises a number of issues.<br>
[0005] Conventionally, the antennas, wiring, camera, inverter board, and display (such as, for example, a liquid crystal display (LCD)), may all be mounted to the display cover to form a display assembly that is structurally rigid. In order to customize such a display cover, there are a number of undesirable options. For example, the display cover may be personalized before the manufacture of the display assembly. However, this solution does not provide flexibility for the user who purchases their IHS and then decides that they wish to personalize it later, or to a user who decides they would like to change how their IHS is personalized. In another example, the display assembly may be disassembled and the display cover replaced. However, this solution is costly in time and/or money as the display assembly will typically have to be disassembled by a professional, and such disassembly risks damaging the display assembly components. In yet another example, a personalized changeable cover may be coupled to the display assembly on top of the display cover. However, this solution increases overall cost and thickness of the IHS.<br>
[0006]     Accordingly, it would be desirable to provide a removable display cover.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
[0007] According to one embodiment, a display assembly includes a display bezel, a display mounted to the display bezel, a display cable coupled to the display, and a display cover coupled to the display bezel such that the display cover is operable to be decoupled from the display bezel while the display remains mounted to the display bezel and the display cable remains coupled to the display.<br>

With the display 500 engaging the display bezel 200, the display 500 engages the display support bracket 215 and the bezel mounting members 520 and 528 may be mounted to the display bezel 200, using fasteners and/or other methods known in the art, in order to mount the display 500 to the display bezel 200.<br>
[0034] Referring now to Figs. 6a, 6c and 6d, the method 600 proceeds to block 606 where the carrier sheet 300, illustrated in Figs. 3a and 3b, is mounted to the display bezel 200. The carrier sheet 300 is positioned adjacent the display bezel 200 and display 500 such that the top surface 312 of the carrier sheet 300 is immediately adjacent the display 500 and the carrier sheet support bracket 324 is adjacent the top wall 206 of the display bezel 200, as illustrated in Fig. 6c. The carrier sheet 300 may then be brought into engagement with the display 500, the connector 322 on the display cable 320 may be mated with a connector (not shown) on the<br>
display 500, and the carrier sheet support bracket 324 may be mounted to the display bezel 200, using fasteners or other methods known in the art, in order to mount the carrier sheet 300 to the display bezel 200, as illustrated in Fig. 6d. In an embodiment, including the components of the carrier sheet 300 on the carrier sheet 300 may, for example, contribute to assembly efficiencies while protecting the components of the carrier sheet 300. However, one of skill the art will recognize that the components of the carrier sheet 300 may be coupled to the display 500 and the display bezel 200 without the need for the carrier sheet 300 while still falling within the scope of the present disclosure.<br>
[0035] Referring now to Figs. 6a, 6d and 6e, the method 600 proceeds to block 608 where an inverter module 608a is mounted to the display bezel 200. The inverter module 608a is positioned adjacent the display support bracket 215 on the display bezel 200, illustrated in Fig. 6d, and then brought into engagement with the display bezel 200 such that the inverter module 608a is located between the display support bracket 215 and the bottom wall 208 of the display bezel. The connector 514 that extends from the bottom edge 506 of the display 500 is coupled to the inverter module 608a, and the inverter module 608a may be mounted to the display bezel 200 using fasteners or other methods known in the art, as illustrated in Fig. 6e. In an embodiment, the inverter module 608a may be included on the carrier sheet 300.<br>
[0036] Referring now to Figs. 6a, 6e, 6f, 6g, 6h, 6i, 6j and 6k, the method 600 proceeds to block 610 where the display cover 400, illustrated in Figs. 4a and 4b, is coupled to the display bezel 200 to provide a display assembly 61 Ob. The display cover 400 is positioned adjacent the display bezel 200 such that the walls 414 and 416 on the display cover 400 are located adjacent the side walls 212 and 210, respectively, on the display bezel 200, and each of the display bezel coupling members 418 on the walls 414 and 416 are aligned with respective display cover coupling member 216 on the side walls 212 and 210, respectively, as illustrated in Fig. 6e. The display cover 400 is then brought into engagement with the display bezel 200 such that the coupling beams 420 on the display bezel coupling members 418 enter the L-shaped entrance channels 217 on the display cover coupling members 216, as illustrated in Fig. 6h. With the coupling beams 420 in the L-shaped entrance channels 217, the display cover 400 is offset from the display bezel 200, as illustrated in Fig. 6g. The display cover 400 may then be moved in a direction A, illustrated in Figs. 6f, 6g and 6h, such that the coupling beams 420 on the display bezel coupling members 418 enter the securing channel 218 and engage the securing surface 220 on the display cover coupling members 216, as illustrated in Fig. 6j. In an embodiment, a<br>
resilient force may be provided to urge the display bezel coupling members 418 into the securing channel 218 by, for example, resiliency in the display cover 400 and/or the display bezel 200, a resilient member in the assembly that engages the display cover 400 and/or display bezel 200, and/or a variety of other methods known in the art. With the coupling beams 420 in the securing channels 218 and engaging the securing surfaces 220, the display cover 400 is aligned with the display bezel 200, as illustrated in Fig. 6i. In an embodiment, the toolless coupling of the display cover 400 to the display bezel 200 is sufficient to keep the display cover 400 coupled to the display bezel 200 without the need of fasteners, and one of skill in the art will recognize that modifications to the structure of the display cover coupling members 216 and display bezel coupling members 418 may enhance such coupling. In an embodiment, a plurality of fasteners 61 Oa may be used between the display bezel 200 and the display cover 400 in order to further secure the display cover 400 to the display bezel 200, as illustrated in Fig. 6k. In an embodiment, the display assembly 61 Ob may be, for example, the display assembly 110, described above with reference to Fig. 1. In an embodiment, the coupling of the display cover 400 and the display bezel 200 to provide the display assembly 61 Ob sandwiches the brackets housed in the display assembly 61 Oa to provide increased rigidity for the display assembly 61 Ob. In an embodiment, the plurality of fasteners 61 Oa may be used to further increase the rigidity of the display assembly 61 Ob by, for example, using fhe fasteners 61 Oa at the corners of the display assembly 61 Ob to engage the display cover 400, the bracket 324, the brackets 516 and/or 524, and the display bezel 200, and the remaining plurality of fasteners 61 Oa engaging the display cover 400, the bracket 324, and the display bezel 200.
