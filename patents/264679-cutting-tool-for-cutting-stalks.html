				<td>CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
This application claims priority to co-pending German Patent Application No. DE<br>
10 2007 007 985.2 entitled "Schneidwerk zum Abschneiden von stangeligem Schnittgut", filed<br>
February 17, 2007.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention generally relates to a cutting tool for cutting plants including stalks.<br>
Such plants including stalks are to be understood as substantially upright growing plants being<br>
made of a comparatively hard and fibrous material. Especially, such plants are cane, corn and the<br>
like. After cutting such plants, rigid remainders of the stalks remain located on the ground.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
A cutting tool for cutting material to be cut, especially grass or crop, is known from German Patent<br>
No. DE 40 35 528 C2. The known cutting tool includes a bar extending over the working width of<br>
the cutting tool. The bar is supported on a supporting element such as a carrier or a plate via which<br>
the cutting tool is suspended at a frame of a vehicle, for example a single-axle tool. A knives set<br>
including an upper knife and a lower knife is movably supported on the bar. The upper knife and<br>
the lower knife each include blades which are driven by driving elements to reciprocate in opposite<br>
directions in a cutting portion. The upper knife and the lower knife are movably supported on the<br>
bar by guiding elements. The bar, the connecting element, the driving elements and the guiding<br>
elements extend partly above and partly below the knife set including the upper knife and the lower<br>
knife. Sliding shoes being located in the center portion and/or in the outer portions of the bar serve<br>
to maintain a constant distance of the knives set with its cutting portion with respect to the ground<br>
during operation of the known cutting tool.<br>
Similar cutting tools are also known from German Patent No. DE 29 22 579 C2 corresponding to<br>
US Patent No. US 4,418,520 and from German Patent No. DE 31 02 861 C2. The arrangement<br>
of the guiding elements with respect to the knives set is to be seen from these prior art references.<br>
The known cutting tools are used for cutting material to be cut including stalks such as grass,<br>
clover, corn, and the like.<br>
A harvesting machine for cutting cane including a plurality of cutting tools is known from German<br>
Patent Application No. DE 36 31 889 A1. The cutting tools either serve for cutting the foliage or<br><br>
for cutting the stalks. The cutting tool for cutting the stalks of the cane includes rotatingly driven<br>
cooperating pairs of cutting discs.<br>
A knife holder which is designed to be openable to easily replace the upper knife is known from<br>
German Patent Application No. DE 25 27 266 A1. Replacing the upper knife does not take place<br>
in the working position, but in a maintenance position of the cutting tool. The cutting tool includes a<br>
bar being supported on a connecting element of the machine and extending over the working width<br>
of the cutting tool. A knives set including an upper knife and a lower knife is supported on the bar,<br>
the blades being driven to reciprocate in opposite directions. The prior art reference does not<br>
contain any disclosure concerning the kind of the drive and the design of the driving elements for<br>
the upper knife and the lower knife. The upper knife is supported on the bar by the openable knife<br>
holders which act as guiding elements. The lower knife is also supported from below by a lower<br>
guiding element. The lower guiding element fulfills the function of guiding elements for the lower<br>
knife. The lower guiding element serving to guide the lower knife extends from the cutting portion of<br>
the knives set of the cutting tool in a way to protrude in a downward direction. Furthermore, locking<br>
screws for adjusting the openable knife holder are provided. There is no free space not including<br>
connecting elements, driving elements or guiding elements below the cutting portion of the knives<br>
set.<br>
A cutting tool for cutting grass and other plants is known from US Patent No. US 3,538,690. The<br>
known cutting tool includes a bar extending over the working width, a knives set including an upper<br>
knife and a lower knife being supported on the bar. The upper knife as well as the lower knife<br>
includes blades being driven to reciprocate in a cutting portion. The upper knife and the lower knife<br>
have an L-shaped angled design. The upper knife and the lower knife with the angled portions are<br>
resilienty suspended in rubber bearings, a plurality of rubber bearings being arranged to extend<br>
over the working width. The upper knife and the lower knife are arranged to be horizontal such that<br>
the cutting portion of the knives is located at a higher place than the bottom surface of the lower<br>
knife. The L-shaped angled upper knife and lower knife may be arranged in different relations with<br>
respect to one another. In these different positions, the space below the cutting portion of the<br>
knives being arranged to be horizontal is either blocked or free.<br>
A corn cutter including a cutting tool is known from German Patent No. DE 28 28 766 C2<br>
corresponding to US Patent No. US 4,267,689. The known cutting tool includes a bar extending<br>
over the working width. The bar includes a knives set including an upper knife and a lower knife<br>
which are supported by guiding elements. The guiding elements for the upper knife and the lower<br>
knife extend into a space below the plane being formed by the upper knife and the lower knife. The<br><br>
prior art reference does not contain any indication with respect to relative positioning of the bar and<br>
the guiding elements or of the knives set. The knives set includes cutting portions and non-cutting<br>
portions being distributed over the working width.<br>
A mowing tool including an upper knife and a lower knife is known from German Patent No.<br>
DE 11 76 415 B. When being used, the upper knife and the lower knife are arranged to be<br>
horizontal. The known mowing tool includes elements extending into the space below the<br>
horizontal plane of the knives set.<br>
A mowing tool including an upper knife and a lower knife is known from German Patent No.<br>
DE 198 26 289 C1. The upper knjfe and the lower knife each include a knife back and cutting<br>
elements being located on the knife back. The upper knife and/or the lower knife are driven to<br>
reciprocate. The cutting elements of the upper knife or of the lower knife are arranged at least with<br>
two different divisions on their respective knife back.<br>
A front mowing tool being located on mowing shoes at the left hand side and at the right hand side<br>
is known from German Patent Application No. DE 27 16 482 A1. The mowing tool includes a bar<br>
on which an upper knife and a lower knife are located. The upper knife and the lower knife are<br>
supported by guiding elements being arranged in a spaced apart manner over the working width.<br>
The prior art reference does not show in detail how the guiding elements are connected to the<br>
lower knife. A cutting plane is formed between the upper knife and the lower knife, the cutting plane<br>
being arranged to be parallel to the ground.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
A cutting tool for cutting plants including stalks includes a bar. The bar has a lower edge and is<br>
designed and arranged to substantially extend over a working width of the cutting tool. A knives<br>
set is being arranged on the bar. The knives set includes an upper knife unit and a lower knife<br>
unit. The upper knife unit includes a plurality of blades including a cutting portion. The upper<br>
knife unit is designed and arranged to be downwardly declined towards the cutting portion. The<br>
lower knife unit includes a plurality of blades including a cutting portion. The lower knife unit is<br>
designed and arranged to be downwardly declined towards the cutting portion. A plurality of<br>
driving elements having a lower edge is designed and arranged to drive the blades to<br>
reciprocate in opposite directions within a cutting region. A plurality of guiding elements is<br>
designed and arranged to connect the upper knife unit and the lower knife unit to the bar. The<br>
cutting portions of the blades of the upper knife unit and the lower knife unit in a working<br>
position of the cutting tool are located at least as low as the lower edge of the bar and the<br><br>
lower edge of the driving elements such that there is a free space being located within the<br>
cutting region. Preferably, the cutting portions of the blades of the upper knife unit and the lower<br>
knife unit in a working position of the cutting tool are located below the lower edge of the bar<br>
and the lower edge of the driving elements.<br>
In the prior art, rotatingly driven cutting elements have been used for cutting plants including<br>
stalks, especially cane. Such known cutting tools have the drawback that the remaining part of<br>
the stalk protruding from the ground has a cut surface which is not flat, but instead uneven and<br>
fibrous. As a result, a plurality of stalks grows later starts growing in that uneven surface. This is<br>
not desired.<br>
When using cutting tools including a knives set including an upper knife and a lower knife which<br>
are driven to reciprocate, one may attain a comparatively smooth cut surface when cutting cane.<br>
However, the remainders of the stalks or stems located on the ground and protruding in an<br>
upward direction are inflexible and unbendable such that the cutting tool contacting these stalks<br>
is deflected and moved, respectively, in an upward direction. Consequently, the knives set<br>
including the upper knife and the lower knife continuously reaches a higher position with respect<br>
to the ground such that the height of the remaining stalks continuously increases, especially<br>
when the stalks grow close to one another in the direction in which the cutting tool is moved.<br>
Additionally, it needs to be taken into account that the plants may have their greatest diameter<br>
at that location and that it may be difficult to cut such a great diameter. The diameter may be in<br>
a region of approximately 50 mm or even more. A major reason for the undesired deflection and<br>
displacement, respectively, of the knives set in the prior art and the step-like cut resulting<br>
therefrom (while there is an increase of the height of the parts of the stalks remaining on the<br>
ground) is the relative arrangement of the bar at the known cutting tools as they are used for<br>
cutting grass, crop and other flexible material to be cut.<br>
With the novel cutting tool, it is possible to cut material to be cut such as plants including stalks,<br>
especially cane, corn and the like, close to the ground and at a constant distance from the<br>
ground while the cut surfaces are clean and smooth. In the novel cutting tool, the cutting<br>
portions of the blades of the knives set are located at least as low as the lower edge of the bar<br>
in the working position of the cutting tool. The cutting portions of the blades of the knives set are<br>
to be understood as the parts and sections, respectively, of the blades of the upper knife and of<br>
the lower knife which realize the cut at the material to be cut due to their reciprocating<br>
movement in opposite directions. Usually, these cutting portions of the blades of the knives set<br><br>
are located approximately in the first third of the front of the blades.<br>
The bar extends over the working width of the cutting tool. Due to the arrangement of the cutting<br>
portions of the blades of the knives set below the lower edge of the bar, the above described<br>
deflecting effect and the harvest losses resulting therefrom in the prior art are prevented. The<br>
relative arrangement may be determined by the design and arrangement of the respective<br>
elements, especially the bar, with respect to the knives set. The angle of declination of the<br>
blades of the knives set with respect to the horizontal ground also has a positive effect. The<br>
knives set is designed and arranged to be downwardly declined towards the front in the working<br>
position. In this way, the free space attained below the bar is further increased.<br>
The free space is a space below the cutting region of the knives set of the cutting tool. No<br>
connecting elements, driving elements, guiding elements or other elements are located in this<br>
free space. The cutting region of the knives set of the cutting tool is to be understood as the<br>
width of the cutting tool perpendicular to the working direction in which actual cutting of the<br>
material to be cut including stalks is realized, meaning in which the cutting tool fulfills its cutting<br>
function. No connecting elements, driving elements or guiding elements are located in the<br>
cutting portion of the knives set of the cutting tool such that this space remains free from the<br>
above described elements and such that the cutting tool does not contact the remaining stalks<br>
of the cut material, and the cutting tool is not dislocated in an upward direction. The connecting<br>
units serving to connect the cutting tool with a frame of a vehicle or of a chassis usually are<br>
located in the center region, meaning symmetric with respect to the vertical longitudinal plane of<br>
the cutting tool. For example, they may be made of a connecting plate or a connecting carrier. In<br>
this way, this connecting unit is located at a place at which most of the stalks to be cut are<br>
located during operation of the cutting tool. The described relative arrangement also applies to<br>
the driving elements for the upper knife unit and the lower knife unit at least when these driving<br>
elements are located in a center portion. When using an outer drive, the relative arrangement is<br>
of no importance or only of less importance.<br>
Due to the fact that the guiding elements are also not located in the region of the free space, the<br>
novel cutting tool is guided on the ground at a constant distance without getting dislocated by<br>
the remainders of the stalks during harvesting. At the same time, the quality of the cut surfaces<br>
is improved, meaning one attains a smooth horizontal cut surface since the blades operate in<br>
accordance with the scissors principle, and there is no plucking or ripping movement acting<br>
upon the material to be cut. Thus, the forces acting upon the blades are reduced and one<br><br>
attains a positive effect concerning durability and usable lifetime of the blades of the knives set.<br>
Preferably, the blades of the upper knife unit and of the lower knife unit are arranged at different<br>
divisions such that one attains a preferably great supporting surface between the blades of the<br>
upper knife unit and the blades of the lower knife unit during cutting. In this way, one<br>
counteracts the effect of the blades - in case they were located at the same division - entering<br>
the cutting gaps between the respective other knife unit. Such an effect would lead to a<br>
disadvantageous vibrating movement, on the one hand, and to increased wear and tear of the<br>
blades, on the other hand. The variation of the divisions of the blades results in a substantial<br>
improvement.<br>
The upper knife unit and the lower knife unit of the knives set have a width extending over the<br>
working width of the cutting tool. This width is greater than the usable width, meaning the cutting<br>
region of the knives set in which actual cutting of the material to be cut takes place. Two guiding<br>
portions are located at both outer sides of the central cutting region of the knives set such that<br>
the sum of these portions corresponds to the total width of the upper knife unit and of the lower<br>
knife unit. The widths of these guiding portions in which cutting does not take place is defined by<br>
leading and feeding elements. These leading and feeding elements may especially be designed<br>
as guiding straps acting upon the material to be cut before the knives set such that the material<br>
to be cut is introduced into the cutting region of the knives set by being slightly bent. On the<br>
other hand, these guiding straps result in alignment of the cutting tool and of the machine<br>
supporting the cutting tool with respect to the rows of plants to be cut. Due to these guiding<br>
straps or other leading and feeding elements, it is ensured that the guiding portions being<br>
formed in this way can be used for arrangement of driving elements and guiding elements being<br>
arranged at least partly below the horizontal plane being defined by the cutting portion of the<br>
knives set. In this way, the guiding elements may be arranged in the guiding portions, and they<br>
can fulfill their function at that place without problems. This also applies to sliding shoes, sliding<br>
soles, and the like, by which one maintains a constant distance between the ground and the<br>
knives set.<br>
The blades of the upper knife unit and of the lower knife unit of the knives set may be arranged<br>
such that there is a respective pressing force pressing them towards one another. This results in<br>
the cutting portions being located as close as possible to a common plane to effectively conduct<br>
a scissors-like cutting movement. In known cutting tools, this pressing force is substantially<br>
supplied by the force of attack and by the pressing force, respectively, of the supporting<br>
elements onto the upper knife unit and the lower knife unit. Since this pressing force is always<br><br>
active, meaning also when there is a gap between the plants to be cut, one attains<br>
comparatively great wear and tear. In the novel cutting tool, the pressing force being supplied by<br>
the supporting elements is substantially reduced or even fully eliminated. The blades are<br>
pressed towards one another by the cutting facets which are arranged to be respectively<br>
declined such that the blades are only pressed towards one another when the blades actually<br>
cut. Furthermore, this only applies to the locations of the knives set where a stalk is actually<br>
being cut. This feature results in a substantial reduction of wear and tear of the blades of the<br>
knives set and thus a respective increase of the durability and lifetime of important elements of<br>
the novel cutting tool. However, it is also possible to only arrange the declined cutting facets at<br>
the upper knife or at the lower knife, while the respective other knife does not include such<br>
cutting facets. In case cutting facets are located at the upper knife and at the lower knife, they<br>
preferably are arranged to be opposite. The angle of declination is coordinated for determining<br>
the pressing force. However, it is to be understood that the knives do not necessarily need to<br>
include such declines facets.<br>
The blades of the upper knife and/or of the lower knife of the knives set may be designed to<br>
include teeth. This means that the cutting facets are toothed. The use of such a toothed design<br>
especially makes sense when using different divisions to prevent the cutting portions of the<br>
blades from hitting one another, penetrating into one another or a different negative effect acting<br>
upon them, and to reduce such effects, respectively. On the other hand, such a toothed blade is<br>
better suitable for cutting very hard fibrous material to be cut as this is the case with cane<br>
compared to a straight continuous blade. The cutting tool may be operated at comparatively<br>
slow working velocities such that the cutting material including stalks may be engaged by the<br>
teeth of the blades to be held in place and then to be cut. Due to the toothed design of the<br>
cutting portions of the blades, one advantageously attains a great local surface pressure with<br>
respect to the surface of the stalk to be cut and thus easy penetration into the material to be cut.<br>
The blades of the upper knife unit and/or the lower knife unit of the knives set may have such an<br>
outer shape that cutting wedges in a region of approximately 30° and less result. This applies to<br>
the usual size of blades of such cutting tools. Such cutting wedges are great enough to allow for<br>
stalks having a comparatively great diameter to enter into the cutting wedge. On the other hand,<br>
the mentioned region of the angle of the cutting wedges realizes self-locking effects. In this way,<br>
one prevents the hard stalk of the material to be cut from being pressed out off the cutting<br>
wedge towards the front when the upper knife and the lower knife move with respect to one<br>
another.<br><br>
There are a number of different possibilities for realizing the blades of the upper knife and/or the<br>
lower knife of the knives set. Usually, the blades are designed as separate elements being<br>
connected to the respective knife back of the upper knife and/or of the lower knife, for example<br>
by rivets. However, it is also possible to design the blades of the upper knife and/or of the lower<br>
knife of the knives set and the respective knife back as one piece. For example, this may be<br>
realized by punching and following additional processing steps.<br>
The driving elements and the supporting elements for the knife back of the lower knife may<br>
especially be arranged higher than the cutting portion of the blades of the knives set in the<br>
working position of the cutting tool. In this way, the arrangement of the driving elements and of<br>
the supporting elements does not have a negative effect.<br>
The bar may be supported on the sliding shoes being supported on the ground, the sliding<br>
shoes being located in the guiding portions of the knives set. The cutting region of the knives set<br>
thus does not include such sliding shoes. Such a sliding shoe is also not located in the center<br>
region of the knives set.<br>
The two guiding portions of the knives set being located at both outer sides of the cutting region<br>
of the knives set may be used for arrangement of guiding elements and also for the<br>
arrangement of driving elements, for example an outer drive. It is advantageous if the two<br>
guiding portions of the knives set each include three guiding elements of which two are<br>
associated with the upper knife unit and one is associated with the lower knife unit or vice versa.<br>
These guiding elements are arranged on the bar such that the cutting region of the knives set of<br>
the cutting tool is maintained in the clamped position. In this way, deflection of the upper knife<br>
and of the lower knife in the cutting portion of the knives set is especially counteracted.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
Fig. 1 is a sectional view and a side view, respectively, of components of a first exemplary<br>
embodiment of the novel cutting tool 1. The material to be cut 2 is illustrated as three schematically<br>
illustrated cane stalks growing on the ground 3. The cutting tool 1 includes a carrier or bar 4<br>
serving as a carrying element and being designed and arranged to continuously extend over the<br>
working width of the cutting tool 1. The elements of the cutting tool 1 are located on the bar 4. The<br>
bar 4 in turn is connected to a frame (not illustrated) of a vehicle or a machine by a connecting unit<br>
5 being designed as a connecting plate (also see Fig. 4). A part of a wheel 6 of the vehicle is<br>
schematically illustrated.<br>
The cutting tool 1 further includes a knives set 7 including an upper knife unit 8 and a lower knife<br>
unit 9. The knife units 8 and 9 are also just called "knife 8" and "knife 9" herein. The upper knife 8<br>
includes a plurality of blades 10 being arranged on a knife back or knife support 11 of the upper<br>
knife 8. The lower knife 9 also includes a plurality of blades 12 being located on a knife back or<br>
knife support 13. For reasons of clarity of the drawings, the knife back 13 is not illustrated in Fig. 1,<br>
but for example in Figs. 8-10. The blades 10 are located on top of the blades 12, and the blades<br>
10, 12 all include a cutting portion 14 being located in their front part of their extension in the<br>
working direction according to arrow 15 (the left hand side in Fig. 1). The cutting portion 14 is to be<br>
understood as the portion of the blades 10 and 12 which actually cuts and with which the material<br>
to be cut 2 gets in contact and is cut thereby. The cutting portion 14 of the blades 10 and 12 of the<br>
knives set 7 when being moved in the direction of arrow 15 during continued cutting defines a<br>
horizontal plane 16 (Fig. 3) which is parallel to the surface of the ground 3. The material to be cut 2<br>
is cut within the horizontal plane 16 such that the remainders of the stalks 17 all have<br>
approximately the same height corresponding to the approximately constant distance of the<br>
horizontal plane 16 to the surface of the ground 3. However, as it is to be seen in Figs. 1-3, the<br>
knives set 7, the knife units 8, 9, the blades 10, 12 and the cutting portions 14, respectively, are<br>
designed and arranged to be downwardly declined towards the front as seen in the direction of<br>
arrow 15. The series of Figs. 1-3 illustrates the continued cutting process of the material to be cut 2<br>
in the working direction according to arrow 15.<br>
As it is generally known in the field of cutting tools, the upper knife 8 and the lower knife 9 of the<br>
knives set 7 are driven to move back and forth    in opposite directions with respect one another.<br><br>
For this purpose, there is a driving element 18 for the upper knife 8, the driving element 18<br>
engaging the knife back 11 of the upper knife 8 in its center portion. A driving element 19 is<br>
associated with the lower knife 9, the driving element 19 being designed and arranged to protrude<br>
from above through a gap between the bar 4 and the knives set 7 in a downward direction and to<br>
be connected to the knife back 13 of the lower knife 9. The reciprocating drive of the upper knife 8<br>
with the blades 10 and the lower knife 9 with the blades 12 is realized by joints 20 and 21 being<br>
located at respective pivot levers 22 and 23. The pivot levers 22 and 23 are only schematically<br>
illustrated in the drawings by the dash-dot lines, and they are connected to a drive of the vehicle.<br>
Glide shoes 24 are connected to the outer portions of the bar 4 (also see Fig. 4), the glide shoes<br>
24 being supported on the ground 3 during operation of the cutting tool 1 such that the cutting tool<br>
1 with its bar 4 is located at a constant height during cutting and thus at a constant distance from<br>
the surface of the ground 3.<br>
It is already to be seen in Figs. 1-3 that a free space 25 is defined below the horizontal plane 16<br>
being defined by the movement of the cutting portion 14 of the knives set 7. The free space 25 is<br>
free from any elements which could contact the remaining part of a stalk 17 after cutting.<br>
Consequently, an upward sliding movement of the cutting tool 1 on the remaining parts of the<br>
stalks 17 is effectively prevented. The bar 4 is located above the horizontal plane 16 such that its<br>
lower edge 26, meaning the lowermost location on the bar 4, is still located above the horizontal<br>
plane 16, meaning it does not protrude below the horizontal plane 16. The same applies to the<br>
driving elements, especially the driving element 19, as well as to the guiding elements 27 and 28<br>
the design and relative arrangement of which will be further described with respect to Fig. 4. For<br>
reasons of clarity of the drawings, the guiding elements 27 and 28 are not illustrated in Figs. 1-3.<br>
Fig. 4 illustrates a schematic top view of elements of the cutting tool 1. The material to be cut 2 is<br>
only schematically illustrated. The cutting tool 1 has a width 31 which substantially corresponds to<br>
the length of the continuous bar 4. The width 33 includes the working width 34 and two guiding p<br>
29 each of which is located next to the working width 34 in an outward direction. The guiding<br>
portions 29 are defined by guiding straps 30 being located on the bar 4. The guiding straps 30<br>
include repelling surfaces by means of which material to be cut 2 is repelled according to arrow 31<br>
and is bent and deflected, respectively, from the guiding portions 29 into the region of the working<br>
width 34. Thus, the working width 34 also defines the width of a cutting region 36, meaning a strip<br>
having the width of the working width 34 in which cutting of the material to be cut 2 takes place.<br>
The guiding portions 29 being formed in this way are however portions in which cutting does not<br>
take place. The guiding portions 29 are used for arrangement of the guiding elements 27 and 28. It<br>
is to be seen in Figs. 4-6 that the design of the elements of the cutting tool 1 is chosen to be<br><br>
substantially symmetric with respect to the longitudinal center plane 32. Only for illustrating two<br>
embodiments in one drawing, the guiding elements 27 and 28 are illustrated to be different when<br>
comparing the left hand side of the drawing with the right hand side of the drawing. It is to be<br>
understood that the left hand side of the drawing illustrates a first exemplary embodiment which<br>
includes the same guiding elements 27 and 28 in a symmetrical arrangement at the other side. The<br>
same applies to the right hand side illustrating a second exemplary embodiment of the<br>
arrangement of the guiding elements 27 and 28.<br>
The guiding elements 27 illustrated in Fig. 4 are associated with the upper knife 8, and they are<br>
connected to blades 10 of the upper knife 8. Their other end is supported in a pivot joint being<br>
located at the bar 4 such that the guiding elements 27 guide the upper knife 8 in a way to fulfill a<br>
reciprocating movement. The guiding elements 28 are associated with the lower knife 9. As is to be<br>
seen in Fig. 9, they extend through gaps between the bar 4 and the knives set 7 in a downward<br>
direction, and they contact the blades 12 of the lower knife 9 from below. As illustrated, the guiding<br>
elements 27 are partly located within the working width 34 and partly within the guiding portions 29.<br>
Due to the fact that they are located above the horizontal plane 16, they do not protrude into the<br>
free space 25 and thus cannot negatively influence cutting of the material to be cut 2. A different<br>
arrangement is chosen with respect to the guiding elements 28 being associated with the lower<br>
knife 9. In this case, the working width 34 is kept free from the guiding elements 28.<br>
In the exemplary embodiment illustrated at the right hand side as seen from the longitudinal center<br>
plane 32, the guiding elements 27 and 28 are arranged such that the guiding element 28 for the<br>
lower knife 9 is located between the guiding elements 27 for the upper knife 8. Due to this spaced<br>
apart arrangement and distribution of the guiding elements 27 and 28, the knives set 7 including<br>
the upper knife 8 and the lower knife 9 is held in a clamped way such that deflections of the knives<br>
set 7 in the working width 34 are prevented. The exemplary embodiment being located on the left<br>
hand side as seen with respect to the longitudinal center plane 32 includes a plate-shaped friction<br>
bearing 35 fulfilling the function of the guiding element 28. Due to the strict linear guiding<br>
arrangement, the lower knife 9 is moved in a linear way while the upper knife 8 is guided by the<br>
guiding elements 27 on a circular arc.<br>
It is to be seen especially in Figs. 5 and 6 that the upper knife 8 as well as the lower knife 9<br>
includes portions which do not fulfill a cutting function. These portions are located within the guiding<br>
portions 29. Corresponding to the working width 34, a cutting region 36 is formed, the blades 10<br>
and 12 being substantially arranged in the cutting region 36. It is to be seen from Figs. 4-6 that the<br>
blades 10 of the upper knife 8 are located in a spaced apart manner with a division 37 (also called<br><br>
separation or spacing) and that the blades 12 of the lower knife 9 are located in a spaced apart<br>
manner with a division 38. The blades 10 and 12 are thus arranged with different divisions 37 and<br>
38. This may also be seen from the coverage illustrated in Fig. 4. This arrangement serves to<br>
support the blades 10 and 12 on one another with a great surface coverage at all times to prevent<br>
and limit, respectively, bending or a slight movement of the blades 10, 12 into the intermediate<br>
spaces between the blades of the respective other knife. For example, the division 37 may be<br>
approximately 70 mm and the division 38 may be approximately 84 mm.<br>
In the exemplary embodiments of Figs. 4-6, the blades 10 and 12 of the upper knife 8 and of the<br>
lower knife 9 of the knives set 7 have an approximately triangular shape. The blades 10 and 12 in<br>
their portions facing the front and the sides, respectively, include cutting facets 39, 40. The cutting<br>
facets 39 and 40 are located to be declined with respect to the horizontal plane 16 in a way that<br>
their angle of declination determines the value of the pressing force with which the blades 10 and<br>
12 are pressed towards one another during cutting. A remaining pressing force usually being low<br>
may be realized by respective pressure of the guiding elements 27 and 28. The cutting facets 39<br>
and 40 are designed to include teeth, as this is especially to be seen in Fig. 5. Such toothing is<br>
preferred for the cutting contact to the material to be cut 2. The toothing engages the material to be<br>
cut 2 such that the tendency of the material to be cut 2 to be deflected towards the front during<br>
cutting does not occur. Due to the toothed design of the cutting portions of the blades 10, 12, one<br>
also attains the advantage of an increased local surface pressure with respect to the surface of the<br>
stalk to be cut and thus easy entrance into the material to be cut 2.<br>
Figs. 8-11 illustrate sectional views and thus clarify the relative arrangement of the elements of the<br>
cutting tool 1 with respect to one another. It is to be especially seen that the free space 25 below<br>
the horizontal plane 16 is kept free from any elements within the working width 34 and the cutting<br>
region 36.<br>
Figs. 12-14 illustrate another exemplary embodiment of the novel cutting tool 1. Fig. 12 illustrates<br>
the knives set 7 including the upper knife 8 and the lower knife 9. It is to be seen in Fig. 13 that the<br>
upper knife 8 is made of one piece of material such that the blades 10 and the knife back 11 are<br>
also designed as one piece. Fig. 14 illustrates the design of the lower knife 9 in which the blades<br>
12 are fixedly located on the knife 13 in a usual way by rivets. It is to be understood that the lower<br>
knife 9 could also be designed as one piece, as this has been illustrated with respect to the upper<br>
knife according to Fig. 13. It is not necessarily required that the upper knife 8 as well as the lower<br>
knife 9 at the blades 10 and 12, respectively, include cutting facets 39 and 40, respectively. In a<br>
simplified exemplary embodiment, the upper knife 8 or the lower knife 9 being designed as one<br><br>
piece may also be designed as punched elements not including declined cutting facets 39 and 40,<br>
respectively.<br>
In accordance with the different divisions 37 and 38 of the blades 10 and 12, there are angled<br>
cutting wedges 41 having an angle 42 being in a range of approximately 30° or less. It is desired to<br>
attain a self-locking effect resulting in the tendency of the material to be cut 2 being pressed from<br>
the cutting wedge 41 towards the front instead of cutting is reduced and eliminated, respectively.<br><br>
