				<td>Field of Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a composition for the removal of colours and inhibitors from plant tissues to isolate RNA. Particularly, this invention relates to a composition and the method to remove the soluble substances that otherwise impart colour to the ribonucleic acid (hereinafter known as RNA) preparations inhibiting down stream applications including synthesis of complementary DNA (hereinafter, referred to as cDNA) and polymerase chain reaction using RNA as one of the substrates. The "soluble substance" in the present invention is in context to the solution used to remove these substances.<br>
Background and prior art references to the Invention<br>
Isolation of RNA is crucial to various molecular biology techniques involving RNA as starting material. These include reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (hereinafter, referred to as RT-PCR), real-time quantitative PCR, microarrays, RNA mapping, in vitro translation. Northern blot analysis, nuclease protection assays and cDNA library construction.<br>
There are several methods described in the literature to isolate RNA from plant tissues [Current Protocols in Molecular Biology by Ausubel, F.M., Brent, R., Kingston, R. E., Moore, D.D., Seidman, J.G., Smith, J.A. and Struhl, K. Eds,1994. John Wiley and Sons, Inc. USA; Cox, R.A.( 1968) In: Methods in Enzymology, Grosmann, L. and Moldave, K. Eds. Vol.12 B, pp. 120-129, Academic Press, Orlando, FL; R.C. Bugos, V.L. Chiang, X-H. Zhang, E.R. Campbell, O.K. Podila, W.H. Campbell, Biotechniques 19 (1995) 734-737; Chirgwin, J.M., Przybyla, A.E., Macdonald, R.J. and Rutter, W.J. (1979) Biochemistry 18: 5294-5299; Chomczynski,  P.  and  Sacchi,  N.  (1987) Anal.   Biochem.   162:156-159;  United<br>
 <br>
states Patent 5,945,515 by Chomczynski, P. (1999); US Patent 5,777,099 by Mehra, M. (1998)]. Recently, Ghawana, S., Singh, K., Riazada, J., Rani, A., Bhardwaj, P. K., and Kumar, S., (Patent filed 0344NF2004/IN Dated 30.03.2006) developed a two-solution system for rapid isolation of RNA composed of solution I [buffer saturated phenol (pH less than 7), SDS (0.1-1%), EDTA (10-20mM), sodium acetate(0.3-0.8M)], and solution II [DEPC(0.001-0.1%) treated deionized water].<br>
Some of the tissues possess very high colour and other interfering chemical substances that often co-precipitate with RNA and make downstream application of RNA problematic. For instance, naphthaquinones (Heide and Tabata, 1987, Photochemistry 26:1645-1650) and anthraquinones (Heide and Leistner, 1983, Phytochemistry 22:659-662) are potent enzyme inactivators. However, none of the methods describe dealing with the tissues containing colours and the associated inhibitors. These molecules co-precipitate along with the RNA and make downstream processing difficult. Purification of RNA using various methods has been described in such cases such as RNeasy technology (RNeasy Plant Mini Kit, Qiagen), NucleoSpin RNA Clean-up (Macherey-Nagel), Norgen's RNA Purification Technology (Norgen Biotek Corp.), Zymo Research's RNA Clean-up Kit (Zymo Research Corp.), RNA purification method using RNACIean (Agencourt Bioscience Corp.) etc.<br>
Thus keeping in purview what all has been reported in the prior art, the drawbacks of the prior art may be summarized as:<br>
 <br>
1.	In tissues such as roots of Arnebia euchroma, Daucus carota and Rheum australe, the coloured molecules and other interfering substances precipitate along with RNA preparations.<br>
2.	Reported protocols till date can isolate RNA, but the isolated RNA is not suitable for downstream processes such as RT-PCR due to the presence of colours and the associated interfering agents. None of the protocols describe a simple and quick method for removal of these interfering chemicals.<br>
Thus, the inventors of the present invention realized that there exists a need to develop a composition which will simply and quickly remove colours and interfering chemicals from plant tissues from which RNA is to be isolated.<br>
Objects of invention<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide a composition for removal of<br>
colours and inhibitors from plant tissues to isolate RNA.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a method for removal of<br>
colours and inhibitors from plant tissues to isolate RNA.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to add aesthetic value to the isolated<br>
RNA by removing colours that sometimes is not liked by the researchers.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a kit for removal of colours<br>
and inhibitors from plant tissues to isolate RNA at an early stage thus making RNA<br>
suitable for downstream applications.<br>
 <br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
Total RNA isolated from roots of Arnebia euchroma, Rheum australe and Daucus carota using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and iRIS system without the composition (coiinmin) and method as claimed in the present invention failed to give good quality of RNA. We assessed the quality of RNA by vahous methods such as absorabance spectrum analysis (using spectrophotometer), eiectrophoresing on denaturating agarose gel and RT-PCR based amplification of 26S rRNA. While with the composition (coiinmin) and method as claimed in the present invention, the remarkable improvement in quality of RNA was observed with no co-precipitation of colour and inhibitory substances, lower absorption spectrum in visual range and undegraded (intact bands of) RNA on denaturating agarose gel.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a composition for the removal of colours and inhibitors from plant tissues comprising:<br>
[a]	0.05 to 0.2% of an anionic detergent;<br>
[b]	0.25 to 0.56 % of a chelating agent;<br>
[c]	70 to 90 % alcohol in diethylpyrocarbonate [DEPC] treated deionized water.<br>
The invention further provides a process for the removal of colours and inhibitors from plant tissues to isolate RNA, characterized in that it employs the composition as claimed in claim 1, wherein the steps comprising;<br>
[a] grinding 10-100 mg of a plant tissue to a fine powder in liquid nitrogen;<br>
 <br>
[b]	adding 2 to 3 ml of the composition as claimed in claim 1 to the powder as obtained in step [a];<br>
[c]	grinding the mixture as obtained in step [b] while still frozen so as to make a homogenous mixture;<br>
[d]	allowing the mixture as obtained in step [c] to thaw with intermittent grinding;<br>
[e]	centrifuging the thawed mixture as obtained in step [d] at 13000 to 14000 rpm for 5 to 10 min at a temperature of 4 to 6 degree C and decanting the supernatant;<br>
[f]	resuspending the pellet as obtained in step [e] in 1 to 2 ml of the composition as claimed in claim 1 and vortexing;<br>
[g]	centrifuging the suspension as obtained in step [f] 13000 to 14000 rpm for 5 to 10 min at a temperature of 4 to 6 degree C and decanting the supernatant to obtain the desired decolorized tissue.<br>

To check the integrity of RNA, 5-6 pg of RNA mixed with 10 pi 2x RNA Loading dye (GenHunter, U.S.A.) and incubated at 65 degree C for 10 min and electrophoresed at 72 volts in IX MOPS buffer (60 mM sodium acetate, 2 mM MOPS and 0.1 mM EDTA), as descnbed by Sambrook, J., Fritsch. E.F., Maniatis, T., (1989) ( In: Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Plainview, NY). Absorption spectrum of isolated RNA was recorded at wavelength ranging 380 to 780 nm using a spectrophotometer.<br>

claimed in the present invention    as described in Example  1-2 and Table  1 describes the yields obtained from different tissues.<br>
EXAMPLE 5<br>
Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed to assess the quality of RNA for downstream applications using the RNA from roots of Arnebia euchroma, Daucus carota and Rheum australe. Total RNA (2 pg) was digested with DNase I (Cat. No. 19303007 Promega, U.S.A.) and reverse-transcribed with AccuScript High Fidelity reverse transcriptase (Cat. No.600089-54, Stratagene, U.S.A.) to synthesize cDNA using oligo-dT primer (Cat. No.200820-52, Stratagene, U.S.A.).The manufacturer's instructions were followed in both the above reactions. For PCR amplification, oligonucleotide primers specific to 26S rRNA (an internal control) were used to amplify this cDNA during 25 cycles, where a cycle was defined as 94°C for 30 seconds, 52°C for 40 seconds, and 72°C for 1 minute. The composition of reaction mixture was 2.5 µl 10X PCR buffer (20 mM Tris-HCI, pH 8.4, 50 Mm KCL, 1.5 mM MgCl2), 0.5 µl Deoxynucleotide triphosphate (dNTPs,10 mM), 1.0 µl Forward primer (10 µM), 1.0µI Reverse primer(10 µM), 1.0 µl cDNA, 0.25 µl Taq DNA polymerase (5U/µL) and 18.75 pi sterile distilled water. The RT-PCR based amplification of 26S rRNA obtained in case of total RNA isolated from roots of Arnebia euchroma, Rheum australe and Daucus carota using the composition (coltnmin) and method as claimed in the present invention, while the RT-PCR failed to give good amplification with total RNA isolated from roots of Arnebia euchroma, Rheum australe and Daucus carota without the composition (colinmin) and method as claimed in the present invention (Figure 4 and 7).<br>
