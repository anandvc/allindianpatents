COMPLETE SPECIFICATION Section 10<br>
'Wheeled Manual Sprayer for Vegetation"<br>
Applicant Gopalbhai Parakrambhai Suratiya<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of this invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br><br>
Field of Invention:<br>
This invention relates to Wheeled Manual Sprayer for Vegetation.<br>
Background<br>
The prior art reveals the existence of different manual sprayers, which are different in construction and utility from the present invention. US Patent No. 5,636,799 describes an electrostatic spray system that has a support for a liquid container, with high voltage components mounted through isolators for providing electrical insulation relative to a low voltage or grounded support. While US Patent No. 4,865,255 description is given about a manual fluid sprayer system, in which sprayer booms are connected to a vehicle by joint structure which permits the boom to pivot upwardly and rearwardly upon engagement with obstructions. The sprayer booms are normally positioned in laterally extending orientations relative to the vehicle by cables, which extend angularly upwardly from the booms and are connected to brackets, which are pivotally supported on the vehicle. Again in US Patent No. 4865225, the description deals with a sprayer that includes an adjustable nozzle, a grip, and an on-off switch. The pumping apparatus includes a supporting cart, wheels, upper and lower support shelves, a removable liquid storage tank resting upon the upper shelf, a rechargeable battery and pump resting upon the lower shelf, and disconnectable liquid lines connecting the tank with the pump and the pump with the sprayer. US 4508248 deals with manual wheeled sprayer, where the pump is mounted on one of the wheel, which decreases the life and directional stability of the system and increases the maintenance cost.<br>
Disadvantages of the Prior Art<br>
There are certain disadvantages associated with the prior art. One of the main disadvantage is that the manual sprayers available in prior art are very costly.<br>
Another disadvantage is that some of the conventional sprayers require electric energy and are difficult to operate.<br><br><br>
Yet another disadvantage is that maintenance of the conventional sprayers is very costly and time consuming affair.<br>
Still another disadvantage is that the conventional sprayers are not usable in all terrains for spraying and in many instances it can harm the crops.<br>
Object of the Invention<br>
It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a wheeled manual sprayer for vegetation, which obviates all the disadvantages associated with prior art.<br>
It is another object of the present invention to provide a wheeled manual sprayer for vegetation, which may be easily and efficiently manufactured and is of durable and solid construction.<br>
An even further object of the present invention is to provide a wheeled manual sprayer for vegetation, which is of low cost and easy to maintain, thereby making such manual sprayer economically available to the purchasing public.<br>
Yet another object of the invention is to make a wheeled manual sprayer for vegetation, which is easy to operate, and can be used in all terrains.<br>
A further object of the invention Is to make a wheeled manual sprayer for vegetation, which can be used on all types of vegetation without any harm to crops.<br>
The following description contains many specifics, these should not be construed as limitations on the scope of the invention, but rather as an exemplification of one preferred embodiment thereof. Many other variations are possible. Accordingly the scope of the invention should not be limited to the embodiment illustrated, and the alterations and variations may be treated within the spirit and scope of this invention.<br>
Statement of the Invention<br>
According to this invention there is provided a wheeled manual sprayer for vegetation comprising a main chassis for supporting a sprayer pump thereon, an axle having wheels provided on either ends thereof being provided for supporting said chassis thereon, a container being provided on to said<br><br><br>
chassis for containing the contents to be sprayed therein, an actuating mechanism being provided below said chassis such that to actuate said sprayer pump for facilitating the spraying action of the pump, spraying means being provided with a stand secured with said main chassis.<br>
Brief Description of the invention<br>
In accordance with the present invention Wheeled Manual Sprayer for Vegetation has a main chassis provided for supporting a sprayer pump and container thereon. The main chassis is supported on an axle having wheels provided on either ends thereof. The container is provided on to the chassis for containing the contents to be sprayed. An actuating mechanism is provided below the chassis so that it can actuate the sprayer pump for facilitating the pump's spraying action. Spraying means are provided with a stand which is secured with the main chassis.<br>
Detailed Description:<br>
A Wheeled Manual Sprayer for Vegetation according to a preferred embodiment is herein described and illustrated in the accompanying drawings. Fig. 1 shows the perspective view of the sprayer Fig. 2 shows the side perspective view of the sprayer Fig 3 shows the driving mechanism for the actuation of the pump. Referring to the drawings particularly Fig. 1 the Wheeled Manual Sprayer for Vegetation has a driving mechanism (1) mounted on a chassis (2) such that to be driven by the main axle (3) provided for supporting said chassis (2). The construction and arrangement of the chassis (2) is such that it gives stability to the manual sprayer while at rest and makes the movement easier. Wheel (4) is provided on both sides of said main axle (3), for transportation of the sprayer from one place to the other. A tank (5) is mounted on said chassis (2) either on the side of the user or on the front / opposite side of the user. A pump (6) is mounted on the chassis (2) above the middle of the main axle (3) to provide better stability and mass distribution. The said pump (6) is mounted on the chassis in such a manner that the piston (7) gets actuated on the forward and backward movement of the wheels (4). An actuating mechanism comprising of driving mechanism (1) and linkage<br><br><br>
mechanism (10) which is provided to actuate sprayer pump (6) for spraying the material through the spraying means (12).<br>
Driving mechanism as shown in fig. 3 has a main gear (8) mounted on the main axle (3), such that to rotate a pinion/ small gear (9) provided below the main chassis (2) such that to receive the drive from the main gear (8). A linkage mechanism (10) is provided such that to actuate piston (7) of the sprayer pump (6). The linkage mechanism (10) has linkages (10a), (10b) and (10c) secured with each other and with said chassis such that to actuate the piston (7) of the sprayer pump (6). However, the linkage mechanism (10) may have more or less linkages in order to increase the efficiency of the operation of the pump (6). The output of the sprayer pump (6) is adapted to be connected to the spraying means (12) provided within a stand (13). Stand (13) is secured at the front side of the main chassis (2). Said stand (13) can be provided at any place, which is convenient for the spraying purposes.<br><br><br>
I claim:<br>
1.	A Wheeled Manual Sprayer for Vegetation comprising:<br>
-	a main chassis (2) for supporting a sprayer pump (6) thereon,<br>
-	an main axle (3) having wheels (4) provided on both ends for supporting said chassis (2).<br>
-	a tank (5) provided on said chassis for containing the material to be sprayed,<br>
characterized in that an actuating mechanism comprising of driving mechanism (1) and<br>
linkage mechanism (10) which is provided to actuate sprayer pump (6) for spraying the<br>
material through the spraying means (12).<br>
2.	A Wheeled Manual Sprayer for Vegetation as claimed in claim 1, wherein the driving mechanism (1) comprises a gear (8) wheel on said main axle (3) and is connected with a pinion (9) secured to said chassis (2) to actuate the piston (7) of the pump (6) with the help of linkage mechanism (10).<br>
3.	A Wheeled Manual Sprayer for Vegetation as claimed in claim 1, wherein said linkage mechanism (10) comprises linkages (10a), (10b) and (10c) linked with each other and with said chassis (2) such that to actuate the piston (7) of said pump (6).<br><br>
