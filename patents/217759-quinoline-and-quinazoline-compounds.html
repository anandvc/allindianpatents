Compounds of the present invention can be produced, for example, according to scheme 1 and scheme 2.<br>
Scheme  1<br>
(Scheme Removed)<br>
wherein R' represents C1-6 alkyl or the like, and R1, R2, R3, 1 (I) .<br><br>
Starting compounds necessary for the synthesis of the compounds according to the present invention are commercially available or may be easily produced by a conventional method. For example, a 4-chloroquinoline derivative can be synthesized by a conventional method as described, for example, in Org. Synth. Col. Vol. 3, 272 (1955), Acta Chim. Hung., 112, 241 (1983), or WO 98/47873.<br>
Alternatively, the 4-chloroquinazoline derivative may be produced by first (1) reacting a benzoic ester with formamide to give a quinazolone derivative and then (2) heating the 4-quinazolone derivative in the presence of phosphorus oxychloride using toluene or sulfolane as a solvent. The quinazolone derivative is generally synthesized in the presence of a solvent such as a benzoic ester, sodium methoxide, formamide, N,N-dimethyl formamide, or methanol.<br>
Next, a 4-(aminophenoxy)quinoline derivative or a corresponding quinazoline derivative can be produced by reacting nitrophenol with the 4-chloroquinoline derivative or corresponding quinazoline derivative in the presence or absence of a suitable solvent to synthesize a 4-(nitrophenoxy)quinoline derivative or a corresponding quinazoline derivative and then stirring the 4-(nitrophenoxy)quinoline derivative or corresponding quinazoline derivative in a suitable solvent, for example, N,N-dimethyl formamide, in the presence of a catalyst, for example, palladium hydroxide-carbon, palladium-carbon, under a hydrogen atmosphere. Alternatively, a 4-(aminophenoxy)quinoline derivative or a corresponding quinazoline derivative may be produced by reacting aminophenol with the 4-chloroquinoline derivative or corresponding quinazoline derivative in the presence of a base, for example, sodium hydride.<br>
Alternatively,    a    4-(aminophenoxy)quinazoline derivative may be produced by dissolving aminophenol in<br><br>
an aqueous sodium hydroxide solution and subjecting the solution to a two-phase reaction with a solution of the 4-chloroquinazoline derivative in an organic solvent in the presence of a phase transfer catalyst, for example, tetra-n-butylammonium bromide, or in the absence of the catalyst.<br>
Scheme  2<br>
(Scheme Removed)<br>
wherein Hal represents a halogen atom, and R1, R2, R3, R4, Rs, R6, R7, R8, R9, R10, R11, and X are as defined in formula (I) .<br>
A substituent can be inserted into R9 by reacting the 4-(aminophenoxy)quinoline derivative or corresponding quinazoline derivative thus obtained with an acid chloride or an acid anhydride in the presence of a base and then reducing the reaction product with aluminum lithium hydride or the like (step 1A).<br>
Alternatively, a substituent can be inserted into R9 by reacting the 4-(aminophenoxy)quinoline derivative or corresponding quinazoline derivative with an aldehyde or a ketone to give an imine compound and then reacting the imine compound with sodium boron cyanohydride or the like (step IB).<br>
The compound represented by formula (I) can be produced by reacting the derivative having a substituent at R9 with an isocyanate derivative according to a conventional method (step 2) and reacting the reaction product with a suitable alkylating agent (R10Hal) in the presence of a base, for example, sodium hydride (step 3).<br>
R9 and R10 may also be introduced by reacting a urea derivative, wherein R9 and/or R10 represent a hydrogen atom, with a suitable alkylating agent (R10Hal) in the presence of a base, for example, sodium hydride, like step 3 (steps 5 and 7).<br>
The urea derivative, wherein R9 and/or R10 represent a hydrogen atom, can be produced by reacting the 4-(aminophenoxy)quinoline derivative or corresponding quinazoline derivative prepared in scheme 1 with an isocyanate derivative according to a conventional method, or by adding triphosgene to the 4-(aminophenoxy)quinoline derivative or corresponding quinazoline derivative in the presence of a base, for example, triethylamine, and then reacting the mixture with a suitable amine derivative (R1:1NH2 or R10R11NH) (steps 4 and 6).<br>
The compund represented by formula (I) , wherein Y represents S, can be produced by reacting an aminothiophenol derivative with a 4-chloroquinoline derivative or a corresponding quinazoline derivative in a suitable solvent, for example, chlorobenzene according to scheme 1 to give a 4-(quinolylsulfanyl)aniline derivative or a 4-(quinazolinylsulfanyl)aniline derivative and then forming a urea portion according to scheme 2.<br>
Use of compounds/pharmaceutical compositions The compounds according to the present invention have inhibitory activity to tumor proliferation in vivo (Pharmacological Test Examples 2, 3, and 4).<br>
Further,  the compounds according to the present<br>
invention inhibit in vitro the autophosphorylation in a<br>
human KDR intracellular region caused by the stimulation<br>
of NIH3T3 cells, which stably develop human KDR, with<br>
VEGF     (vascular     endothelial     growth     factor)<br>
(Pharmacological Test Example 1) . Binding of VEGF to KDR,<br>
a receptor for VEGF on a cell membrane,  induces the<br>
activation of MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) or<br>
the like through the autophosphorylation of the KDR<br>
intracellular region with tyrosine kinase  (Shibuya M,<br>
Ito N,  Claesson-Welsh L. ,  in Curr.  Topics Microbiol<br>
Immunol., 237, 59-83 (1999); and Abedi, H. and Zachary,<br>
I.,  J.  Biol.  Chem.,  272,  15442-15451  (1997)).   The<br>
activation of MAPK is known to play an important role in<br>
the growth of vascular endothelial cells in angiogenesis<br>
(Merenmies,  J.  et al. , Cell Growth &amp; Differ.,  83-10<br>
(1997);  and Ferrara,  N.  and Davis-Smyth,  T.,  Endocr.<br>
Rev.,  18,  4-25  (1997)).    Therefore,  the  compounds<br>
according to the present invention have angiogenesis<br>
inhibitory activity.<br>
Angiogenesis at pathologic sites is known to be deeply involved in diseases, such as tumor, diabetic retinopathy, chronic rheumatism, psoriasis, atherosclerosis, and Kaposi's sarcoma, and metastasis of<br>

Pharmacological Test Example 1: Measurement of inhibitory activity against KDR phosphorylation by ELISA NIH 3T3 cells expressing human KDR (Sawano A et al., Cell Growth &amp; Differentiation, 7, 213-221 (1996), "Flt-1 but not KDR/Flk-l tyrosine kinase is a receptor for placenta growth factor, which is related to vascular endothelial growth factor") prepared by transfection of human KDR gene were cultured in a DMEM containing 10% fetal calf serum (purchased from GIBCO BRL) within a 5% carbon dioxide incubator until 50 to 70% confluent. The harvested cells were inoculated into wells of a collagen-type one-coat 96-well flat-bottom plate, each containing the same medium, in an amount of 1.5 x 104 per well, followed by cultivation at 37°C overnight. The medium was then replaced by a DMEM medium containing 0.1% fetal calf serum. A solution of a test compound in dimethyl sulfoxide was added to each well, and the cultivation was continued at 37°C for additional one hr. A human recombinant vascular endothelial growth factor (hereinafter abbreviated to "VEGF") was added to a final concentration of 100 ng/ml, and the stimulation of cells was carried out at 37°C for 2 min. The medium was removed, the cells were washed with phosphate buffered saline (pH 7.4), and 50 |j,l of a solubilization buffer (20 mM HEPES (pH 7.4), 150 mM NaCl, 0.2% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 5 mM sodium orthovanadylate, 5 mM disodium ethylenedi amine tetraacetate, and 2 mM Na4P207) was then added thereto. The mixture was shaken at 4°C for 2 hr to prepare a cell extract.<br>
Separately, phosphate buffered saline (50 (j.1, pH 7.4) containing 5 |j.g/ml of an anti-phospho-tyrosine antibody (PY20; purchased from Transduction Laboratories) was added to a microplate for ELISA (Maxisorp; purchased from NUNC), followed by standing at 4°C overnight to form a solid phase on the wells. After washing of the plate, 300 \xl of a blocking solution was added, followed by standing at room temperature for 2 hr<br>
to perform blocking.  After washing, the whole quantity<br>
of the cell extract was transferred to the wells, and<br>
the plate was then allowed to stand at 4°C overnight.<br>
After  washing,  an  anti-KDR antibody  (purchased  from<br>
Santa Cruz) was allowed to react at room temperature for<br>
one hr, and, after washing, a peroxidase-labeled anti-<br>
rabbit Ig antibody (purchased from Amersham) was allowed<br>
to react at room temperature for one hr.  After washing,<br>
a chromophoric substrate for peroxidase (purchased from<br>
Sumitomo  Bakelite  Co.,  Ltd.)  was  added  thereto  to<br>
initiate a reaction.  After a suitable level of color<br>
development, a reaction termination solution was added<br>
to stop the reaction, and the absorbance at 450 nm was<br>
measured   with   a   microplate   reader.      The   KDR<br>
phosphorylation activity for each well was determined by<br>
presuming the absorbance with the addition of VEGF and<br>
without the addition of the medicament to be 100% KDR<br>
phosphorylation activity and the absorbance without the<br>
addition  of  the medicament  and VEGF  to  be  0%  KDR<br>
phosphorylation activity.  The concentration of the test<br>
compound was varied on several levels, the inhibition<br>
(%) of KDR phosphorylation was determined for each case,<br>
and the concentration of the test compound necessary for<br>
inhibiting  50%  of  KDR  phosphorylation   (IC50)   was<br>
calculated.<br>
