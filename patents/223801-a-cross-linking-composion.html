				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention is directed to melamine and/or guanamine-based crosslinking.<br>
compositions and their method of preparation. In particular, the invention relates to<br>
melamine and/or guanamine-based crosslinking compositions, which are prepared by<br>
reacting melamine and/or guanamine with mono(alkylaldehydes), poly(alkylaldehydes)<br>
and/or alcohols.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Traditional industrial coatings have for years been based in significant part on<br>
backbone resins having active hydrogen groups crosslinked with various derivatives of<br>
amino-1,3,5-triazines. Most notable among the amino-1,3,5-triazine derivatives are the<br>
aminoplasts such as the alkoxymethyl derivatives of melamine and guanamines which,<br>
while providing excellent results in a number of aspects, have the disadvantage of<br>
releasing formaldehyde as a volatile by-product under curing conditions and requiring<br>
relatively high temperatures to adequately crosslink the film.<br>
Despite the excellent film coating properties, which can be achieved with<br>
aminoplast crosslinked systems, the coatings industry is under great pressure to reduce<br>
the environmentally undesirable emission of formaldehyde. In addition, high temperature<br>
crosslinking systems require more energy to cure and/or crosslink slower resulting in less<br>
throughput. As a result, it has long been a desire of industry to find acceptable alternative<br>
crosslinkers and coatings systems, which emit no formaldehyde or low amounts of<br>
formaldehyde and cure at lower temperatures.<br>
U.S. Patent Nos. 3, 806, 508 and 4,180,488 disclose the preparation of resins<br>
prepared by reacting melamine with a mono(alkylaldehyde) and an alcohol. However,<br>
neither patent discloses nor teaches reacting melamine with a mono(alkylaldehyde) and a<br>
mixture of alcohols.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 4,454,133 discloses the preparation of antimicrobial compounds<br>
prepared by reacting an amide or imide compound with poly(alkylaldehydes) (e.g.,<br>
glutaraldehyde). However, the patent neither discloses nor teaches reacting a melamine<br>
with a mono(alkylaldehyde) and a poly(alkylaldehyde).<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a crosslinking composition comprising a compound having the<br>
structure of Formula I:<br>
where Z is a hydrogen, an alkyl of 1 to about 18 carbon atoms, an aryl of about 6 to about 24<br>

This invention also relates to a crosslinking composition comprising a compound<br>
having the structure of Formula III:<br>
where 2 is a hydrogen, an alkyl of 1 to about 18 carbon atoms, an aryl of 6 to about 24<br>
carbon atoms, an aralkyl of 7 to about 24 carbon atoms, or -NR2R2; each R2 is independently<br>

above compound of Formula III may be prepared by reacting a melamine and/or guanamine<br>
with a mono(alkylaldehyde) and two or more alcohols.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
In the present invention, the term "mono(alkylaldehyde)" is an aldehyde having the<br>
general formula: R-CHO, where R is alkyl, halogenated alkyl. aryl, aralkyl, halogenated<br>
aralkyl, alkoxyalkyl or an alkaryl, having from 1 to about 24 carbon atoms, or about 1 to 12<br>
carbon atoms, or about 1 to 4 carbon atoms.<br>
The term "poly(alkylaldehyde)" is an aldehyde having the general formula: B-[-CHO]n<br>
where B is a organic residue of a poly(alkylaldehyde) with n aldehyde groups and n is an<br>
integer of 2 to about 8. A non-limiting example of a poly(a!ky!aldehyde) is glutaraldehyde<br>
having the structure OHC-(CH2)3-CHO, where B is -(CH2)3- and n is equal to 2.<br>
The term "and/or" means either or both. For example, "A and/or B" means A or B, or<br>
both A and B.<br>
This invention relates to a crosslinking composition comprising a compound having<br>
the structure of Formula I: <br>
where 2 is a hydrogen, an alkyl of 1 to about 18 carbon atoms, an aryl of about 6 to about 24<br>
carbon atoms, an aralkyl of about 7 to about 24 carbon atoms, or-NR2R2; each R2 is<br>
independently hydrogen, an alkyl, aryl or an aralkyl of 1 to about 18 carbon atoms or R3;<br>
where R3 is -CHROR, or <br>
where R is alkyl, halogenated alkyl, aryl, aralkyl, halogenated aralkyl, alkoxyalkyl or an alkaryl<br>
having from 1 to about 24 carbon atoms; R1 is a hydrogen, alkyl, aryl, aralkyl, alkoxyalkyl or<br>
an alkaryl having from 1 to about 24 carbon atoms; and where the alkyl or aryl groups in each<br>
radical may optionally have heteroatoms in their structure; B is a organic residue of a<br>
poly(alkylaldehyde) with n aldehyde groups; n is an integer of 2 to about 8; and A is an amino<br>
moiety derived from the group consisting of guanamine and melamine.<br>
The above composition may be prepared by reacting a melamine and/or guanamine<br>
with a mono(alkylaldehyde), a poly(alkylaldehyde) and an alcohol in a one-step or multi-step<br>
process. In one embodiment of a multi-step process, the melamine and/or guanamine is first<br>
reacted with the mono(alkylaldehyde) and poly(alkylaldehyde). The resulting reaction<br>
product is then reacted with the alcohol to form the crosslinking composition.<br>
Generally, one -NH group from the melamine or guanamine reacts with an aldehyde<br>
group in the mono- or poly(alklyaldehydes) as set for below.<br><br>
where A and R are defined above<br>
During the etherification reaction, the hydroxyl groups may be etherified by the<br>
reacting alcohol (R1-OH).<br><br>
In this application, A would typically have the structure:<br><br>
where Z and R2 are defined above.<br>
It should be noted that more than one poly(alkylaldehyde) could react with a<br>
melamine and/or guanamine resulting in an oligomer. The term "oligomer" in this application<br>
means a compound having 2 or more melamine and/or guanamine moieties. Preferably, the<br>
oligomer has a number average molecular weight of from about 500 to about 5000, or about<br>
500 to about 3000, or about 500 to about 2000.<br>
In the above structure of Formula I, is it theoretically possible that the mono and<br>
poly(alklyaldehydes) would have six possible active sites to react with the melamine.<br>
However, it is believed that practically there would be one reactive site for each nitrogen atom<br>
off the triazine ring. In that case, the resulting crosslinking composition would comprise<br>
compounds having the structure of Formula II:<br>
where Z, B, R1 and R2 are defined above.<br>
Preferably for Formulas I and II, Z is -NHR2, an alkyl of 1 to about 8 carbon atoms<br>
or an aryl of 6 to about 24 carbon atoms; R is C, to C8 alkyl; R1 is a C1 to C8 alkyl or a C1 to<br>
C8 alkoxyalkyl; B is methylene, ethylene, propylene or a structure of the formula:<br>
which is the 1,4 Michael addition of crotonaldehyde with trimethylolpropane. Similarly, one<br>
may use the reaction product of crotonaldehyde and polyhydritic alcohols, such as glycerol,<br>
pentaerythritol, sorbitol, 1,4-butanediol, sugars, starches, cellulose and the like; or adducts<br>
and polymers of a, ß-unsaturated aldehydes.<br>
Also preferably, R1 is derived from an alcohol selected from the group consisting of:<br>
methanol, ethanol, propanol, isopropanol, butanol, isobutanol, cyclohexanol, phenol, benzyl<br>
alcohol, monoalkyl ether of ethylene or propylene glycol and mixtures thereof. More<br>
preferably, R1 is derived from methanol, butanol, monomethyl ether of ethylene glycol or<br>
monomethyl ether of propylene glycol.<br>
In addition, it is also preferred that about 10% to about 90% of the R2 groups, or about<br>
15% to about 70%, or about 30% to about 50% of the R2 groups on a molar basis are<br>
-CHROR1.<br>
As described above, the general process for preparing the crosslinking compositions<br>
containing compounds of Formulas I and II comprises reacting a melamine and/or guanamine<br>
with a mono(alkylaldehyde), a poly(alkylaldehyde) and an alcohol.<br>
Non-limiting examples of mono(alkylaldehyde) that may be used in the reaction are<br>
acetaldehyde, propionaldehyde, n-butyraldehyde, isobutyraldehyde, valeraldehyde,<br>
chloral, caproaldehyde, octylaldehyde, acrolein, crotonaldehyde and mixtures thereof.<br>
Non-limiting examples of poly(alkylaldehyde) that may be used in the reaction are<br>
glutaraldehyde; the reaction products of crotonaldehyde and polyhydritic alcohols, such as<br>
glycerol, trimethylolpropane, pentaerythritol, sorbitol, 1,4-butanediol, sugars, starches,<br>
cellulose and the like; or adducts and polymers of a, ß-unsaturated aldehydes.<br>
Non-limiting examples of alcohols that may be used in the reaction are methanol,<br>
ethanol, propanol, isopropanol, butanol, isobutanol, cyclohexanol, phenol, benzyl alcohol,<br>
monoalkyl ether of ethylene or propylene glycol and mixtures thereof.<br>
In the above reaction, the molar ratio of amino groups in the melamine and/or<br>
guanamine to mono(alkylaldehyde) is about 1:0.1 to about 1:30, or about 1:0.25 to about<br>
1:10 or about 1:0.5 to about 1:5. In this application "amino groups" include groups with<br>
primary and/or secondary amines, i.e., -NH2 and -NHR groups respectively.<br>
In addition, the molar ratio of amino groups in the melamine and/or guanamine to<br>
aldehyde groups in the poly(alkylaldehyde) is about 0.1:1 to about 50:1, or about 0.5:1 to<br>
about 25:1 or about 1:1 to about 10:1.<br>
The molar ratio of aldehyde groups in the mono(alkylaldehyde) and<br>
poly(alkylaldehyde) to alcohol is about 1:0.2 to about 1:50, or about 1:0.5 to about 1:25 or<br>
about 1:1 to about 1:10.<br>
The above reaction may be prepared in a one-step or multi-step process. In one<br>
embodiment of a multi-step reaction, the melamine and/or guanamine are first reacted with<br>
the mono(alkylaldehyde) and/or poly(alkylaldehyde) compounds, (alkylolation reaction) and<br>
the etherification step would occur by the reaction with the alcohol. In another embodiment<br>
of a multistep reaction, the melamine and/or guanamine are first reacted with the<br>
mono(alkylaldehyde) followed by etherification with the alcohol, and then reacted with the<br>
poly(alkylaldedyde) followed by another etherification step with the aicohol. In a further<br>
embodiment of a multistep reaction, the melamine and/or guanamine are first reacted with<br>
the poly(alkylaldehyde) followed by etherification with the alcohol, and then reacted with<br>
the mono(alkylaldedyde) followed by another etherification step with the alcohol.<br>
The alkylolation reaction is preferably conducted in the presence of a catalyst. An<br>
acid or base catalyst may be used. Non-limiting examples of acid catalysts are: p-<br>
toluenesulfonic acid, sulfamic acid, glacial acetic acid, mono or polychlorinated acetic<br>
acids, sulfuric acid, nitric acid, napthylenesulfonic acid, alkyl phosphonic acids,<br>
phosphoric acid and formic acid. Non-limiting examples of base catalysts are inorganic<br>
basic salts such as the hydroxides, carbonates or bicarbonates of lithium, sodium,<br>
potassium, calcium and magnesium, or the organic bases and basic salts such as amines<br>
and guanidine, quaternary-ammonium, phosphonium hydroxide and (bi-)carbonate salts.<br>
The etherification reaction is preferably conducted in a presence of an acid<br>
catalyst. The same acid catalysts described above for the alkylolation reaction may also<br>
be used in the etherification reaction.<br>
The process for preparing the composition is carried out at a temperature from<br>
about 0° C to about 125°C, or about 25°C to about 100°C or about 50°C to about 75°C for<br>
a time of about 0.5 hours to about 48 hours, or about 1 hour to about 24 hours or about 1<br>
hour to about 12 hours.<br>
This invention also relates to a crosslinking composition comprising a compound<br>
having the structure of Formula III: <br>
where Z is a hydrogen, an alkyl of 1 to about 18 carbon atoms, an aryl of 6 to about 24<br>
carbon atoms, an aralkyl of 7 to about 24 carbon atoms, or -NR2R2; each R2 is independently<br>
hydrogen, an alkyl, aryl or an aralkyl of 1 to about 24 carbon atoms or R3;<br>
R3 is -CHROR1 where R1 is hydrogen, alkyl, aryl, aralkyl, or an alkaryl having from 1 to<br>
about 24 carbon atoms; and R is an alkyl, halogenated alkyl, aryl, aralkyl, halogenated<br>
aralkyl, or an alkaryl having from 1 to about 24 carbon atoms; where the alkyl or aryl groups<br>
in each radical may optionally have heteroatoms in their structure and with the provisos that<br>
at least some R1 groups are derived from a mixture of two or more alcohols and at least one<br>
R2 is R3. In one embodiment, one R2 group off each nitrogen is hydrogen.<br>
The phrase "derived from a mixture of two or more alcohols" means that compound of<br>
Formula III in the composition will have at least two different Rn alkyl groups because the<br>
reaction is charged with two or more alcohols during the etherification reaction(s).<br>
Preferably for Formula III, Z is -NHR2, an alkyl of 1 to about 8 carbon atoms or an<br>
aryl of 6 to about 24 carbon atoms; R is C1 to C8 alkyl; R1 is a C1 to C8 alkyl or a C1 to C8<br>
alkoxyalkyl.<br>
Also preferably, R1 is derived from two or more alcohols selected from the group<br>
consisting of: methanol, ethanol, propanol, isopropanol, butanol, isobutanol, cyclohexanol,<br>
phenol, benzyl alcohol, monoalkyl ether of ethylene or propylene glycol and mixtures thereof.<br>
More preferably, R1 is derived from two or more of methanol, butanol, monomethyl ether of<br>
ethylene glycol or monomethyl ether of propylene glycol.<br>
In addition, it is also preferred that about 10% to about 90% of the R2 groups, or about<br>
15% to about 70%, or about 30% to about 50% of the R2 groups on a molar basis are<br>
-CHROR1.<br>

Non-limiting examples of alcohols that may be used in the reaction are methanol;<br>
ethanol, propanol, isopropanol, butanol, isobutanol, cyclohexanol, phenol, benzyl alcohol,<br>
monoalkyl ether of ethylene or propylene glycol and mixtures thereof.<br>
In the above reaction, the molar ratio of amino groups in the melamine and/or<br>
guanamine to mono(alkylaldehyde) is about 1:0.1 to about 1:30, or about 1:0.25 to about<br>
1:10 or about 1:0.5 to about 1:5.<br>
The molar ratio of aldehyde groups in the mono(alkylaldehyde) to alcohol is about<br>
1:0.2 to about 1:50, or about 1:0.5 to about 1:25 or about 1:1 to about 1:10.<br>
The above reaction may be also be prepared in a one-step or multi-step process.<br>
Preferably, the reaction is a multi-step reaction where the melamine and/or guanamine are<br>
first reacted with the mono(alkylaldehyde) compound (alkylolation reaction) and the<br>
etherification step would occur by the reaction with two or more alcohols. In another<br>
embodiment, the etherification reaction step would be a two-step process (e.g., a trans-<br>
etherification process) as illustrated in Example 1 below.<br>
The alkylolation reaction is preferably conducted in the presence of a catalyst.<br>
Preferably, the catalyst is an acid or base catalyst. Non-limiting examples of acid<br>
catalysts are p-toluenesulfonic acid, sulfamic acid, glacial acetic acid, mono or<br>
polychlorinated acetic acids, mono or polyhalogenated acetic acids, sulfuric acid, nitric<br>
acid, napthylenesulfonic acid, alkyl phosphonic acids, phosphoric acid and formic acid.<br>
Non-limiting examples of base catalysts are inorganic basic salts such as the<br>
hydroxides, carbonates or bicarbonates of lithium, sodium, potassium, calcium and<br>
magnesium, or the organic bases and basic salts such as amines and guanidine, quaternary-<br>
ammonium, phosphonium hydroxide and (bi-)carbonate salts.<br>
The etherification reaction is preferably conducted in a presence of an acid<br>
catalyst. The same acid catalysts described above for the alkylolation reaction may also<br>
be used in the etherification reaction.<br>
The reaction is carried out at a temperature from about 0°C to about 125°C, or ,<br>
about 25°C to about 100°C or about 50°C to about 75°C for a time of about 0.5 hours to<br>
about 48 hours, or about 1 hour to about 24 hours or about 1 hour to about 12 hours.<br>
In the preparation of the compounds of Formula III, oligomeric products resulting<br>
from a self-condensation reaction may be obtained. Non-limiting examples of these self-<br>
condensation products are given below in Formulas IV and V.<br>

In a suitable flask was mixed 126 grams of Melamine (1 mole) with 388 grams of<br>
propionaldehyde (6 moles), 750 ml of methanol and 2.5 grams of p-toluenesulfonic acid,<br>
monohydrate (p-TSA:H2O) as the catalyst. The mixture was heated to 65°C and kept for<br>
2 hours. The solution was then stripped under vacuum at a temperature less than 60°C<br>
and at a pressure less than 75 mm Hg. Liquid chromatography (LC) showed that the<br>
resulting mixture contained bis-substituted in addition to tris(propylol)melamine methyl<br>
ether. GPC analysis showed an oligomeric content of about 15%.<br>
B. Methoxy/Butoxy Resin<br>
The product in 1A was mixed with 200 grams of butanol and 2.0 grams of p-<br>
TSA:H2O. The mixture was then heated to reflux. When refluxing temperature reached<br>
85°C, the solution was cooled. A filter agent, Celite® 545 from Aldrich® (1 gram) was<br>
added, and the salts were filtered off. The resulting foil solid content of the resin was<br>
65.8%. LC analysis showed the product was a mixture of methoxy and butoxy derived<br>
from the trans-etherification in butanol.<br>
Example 2. Preparation of Tris(propylol)melamine Mixed Methoxy/Methoxy-2-<br>
Propoxy Ethers<br>

of propionaldehyde (0.6 moles), 75 ml of methanol and 0.25 grams of p-TSA:H2O. The<br>
mixture was heated to 65°C, and kept for 2 hours. The acid catalyst was then neutralized<br>
by a caustic solution after the solution was cooled to 50°C. The solution continued to cool<br>
to precipitate solids, which were then separated by filtration. The solids had a melting<br>
point of 152-154°C.<br>
Example 4C. Preparation of Tris(propylol)melamine Butyl Ether Comparison<br>
In a suitable flask was mixed 12.6 grams of melamine (0.1 mole) with 46.4 grams<br>
of propionaldehyde (0.8 moles), 75 ml of butanol and 0.25 grams of p-TSA:H2O. The<br>
mixture was heated to 65°C and kept for 2 hours. The acid catalyst was then neutralized<br>
by a caustic solution after the solution was cooled to 50°C. Butanol (30 g) was then<br>
added, and the insoluble solids were filtered. The foil solids content of the resin was<br>
54.1%.<br>
Example 5. Reaction of Bis(propylol)melamine Methyl Ether with Glutaraldehyde<br>
A. Preparation of Bis(propy!ol)melamine Methyl Ether<br>
In a suitable flask was mixed 63 grams of melamine (0.5 mole) with 87 grams of<br>
propionaldehyde (1.5 moles), 750 ml of methanol and 2.5 grams of p-TSA:H2O. The<br>
mixture was heated to 65°C, and'kept for 5 hours. The solution was cooled to ambient<br>
temperature. The precipitated solids, which were separated by filtration, had a melting<br>
point of 242°C. NMR showed that the compound was bis(propylol)melamine methyl<br>
ether.<br>
B. Reaction with Glutaraldehyde<br>
The solid in 5A above (2.7 grams) was mixed with 1.0 gram of a 50% aqueous<br>
glutaraldehyde solution, 20 grams of methanol and 10 grams of water. The mixture was<br>
heated to reflux for 2 hours and became clear. The volatiles were removed by vacuum<br>
distillation to give 6.2 grams of a resin (50% solid).<br>
Examples 6 and 7. Solvent Resistance of Mixed Melamine Ethers Coatina<br>
Formulations<br>
Coating Compositions containing the crosslinking resins of Examples 1B and 2<br>
were prepared by mixing 40 parts crosslinking resin with 60 parts acrylic backbone resin<br>
(Joncryl® 500) and 0.5 parts dimethyl acid pyrophosphate catalyst in butanol. Both<br>
formulations were applied on iron phosphate treated cold roll steel panels and baked at<br>
75°C for 30 minutes. The resulting film thickness was approximately 1 mil. Solvent<br>
resistances of the baked films were measured using a methylethyl ketone (MEK) rub. The<br>
results are shown in table 1 below.<br>
Example 8. Cure Response of Coating Containing the Crosslinking Resin Prepared by<br>
Reacting Bis(propylol)melamine Methyl Ether with Glutaraldehyde<br>
A coating compositions containing the crosslinking resin of Example 5B was.<br>
prepared by mixing 50 parts crosslinking resin with 50 parts acrylic backbone resin<br>
(Joncryl® 500) and a 0.5 parts dimethyl acid pyrophosphate catalyst in butanol. The<br>
formulations were applied on iron phosphate treated cold roll steel panels and baked at<br>
75°C for 10, 20 and 30 minutes. Solvent resistances of the baked films were measured<br>
using a methylethyl ketone (MEK) rub. The results are shown in Table 2 below.<br>
Examples 9 and 10. Solvent Resistance of Coatings Containing the Crossiinking<br>
Resins of Examples 1B and AC.<br>
Coating Compositions containing the crossiinking resins of Examples 1B and 4C<br>
were prepared by mixing 40 parts crossiinking resin with 60 parts acrylic backbone resin<br>
(Joncryl® 500) and a 0.5 parts dimethyl acid pyrophosphate catalyst in butanol. Both<br>
formulations were applied on iron phosphate treated cold roll steel panels and baked at<br>
75°C for 30 minutes. Solvent resistance of the baked films were measured using a<br>
methylethyl ketone (MEK) rub. The results are shown in Table 3 below.<br>
The results show that the mixed ether melamine resin showed vastly superior<br>
results over the tris(propylol)melamine butyl ether melamine comparison.<br>
Attempts were made to prepare a coating composition containing the crossiinking<br>
resin of Example 3C (tris(propylol)melamine methyl ether) to compare with the coating<br>
composition of Example 9. The resin of Example 3C was added to a number of solvents<br>
typically used in the coating industry such as toluene, methyl ethyl ketone, butylacetate,<br>
butanol and methanol. High temperatures were required in order to prepare homogenous<br>
solutions. However, when the temperature of the mixture was cooled to ambient.<br>
temperature, the crosslinker resin precipitated from the solution. Therefore, a coating<br>
composition containing the resin of Example 3C could not be prepared.<br>
