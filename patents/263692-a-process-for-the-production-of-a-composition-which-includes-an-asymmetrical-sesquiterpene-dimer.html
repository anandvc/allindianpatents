TREATMENT OF PARASITIC INFECTIONS [N HUMANS AND ANIMALS<br>
THIS INVENTION relates to the treatment of parasitic infections in humans and animals. More particularly, the invention relates to a substance or composition, and to one or more compounds for use in such treatment, which may be therapeutic or prophylactic, to a method of such treatment, and to a process for the production of such substance or composition and compounds, for the treatment of parasitic infections, the substance or composition and compounds, the methods of treatment and the process of production all being useful for, but not limited to, the prophylaxis or treatment of malarial parasitic infections by Plasmodium species, in particular P. falciparum.<br>
According to the invention there is provided a process for the production of a substance or composition for the treatment, by therapy or prophylaxis, of parasitic infections, in particular malarial infections such as Plasmodium falciparum infections, of the human or animal body, the process comprising the steps of:<br>
extracting the substance or composition from a starting material comprising plant roots of the plant species Dicoma anomala, by subjecting the plant root starting material to extraction using an organic solvent to obtain a liquid extract containing the substance or composition; and<br><br>
removing the solvent from the liquid extract to leave a dried extract containing the . substance or composition.<br>
While the extraction may be a cold (room temperature) extraction, it may be a hot (Soxhlet) extraction. Thus the extraction may be a hot extraction carried out at an elevated temperature in the range 35 - 140°C, for example 35 - 50°C. Conveniently, however, the extraction is a cold extraction carried out at a temperature of at most 40°C.<br>
The plant root starting material may be a solid plant material in a finely divided form, having a particle size not exceeding 100μ m, preferably not exceeding 10pm. Thus, in other words, the plant root starting material may be in powdered form having a particle size of at most 100pm, preferably at most 10μ m.<br>
One or more organic liquids may be used as the solvent for the extraction, either separately in sequence, or as mixtures or blends. The solvent may be a polar solvent having a polarity index in the range 0.00 - 5.00. Preferably each liquid or blend of liquids used as the solvent thus may have a polarity index of at least 0.00 and at most 5.00. In particular, the solvent may have a polarity index of 1.0 - 4.8 and may comprise at least one member selected from the group consisting of the solvents set forth in the following table, Table 1, in which the polarity indices of the solvents are also listed:<br><br><br><br>
The process may include subjecting the plant root starting material to a preliminary extraction, using a non-polar organic solvent having a polarity index of less than 3.90, preferably a polarity index in the range 3.10 - 3.50, followed by drying to evaporate residual non-polar solvent from the solid plant material, and then subjecting the dried plant root material, from which the non-polar solvent has been removed, to the extraction, to obtain the liquid extract containing the substance or composition. The preliminary extraction may be carried out with the non-polar solvent at a temperature of 15 - 30°C, the drying being carried out at a temperature not exceeding 40°C, and both extractions being carried out to exhaustion. In particular, the process may include subjecting the dried extract containing the substance or composition to removal of tannin therefrom using a polymer of an organic amide.<br>
Thus, in a preferred embodiment of the process of the present invention the powdered plant root starting material is subjected to a preliminary extraction, which may<br><br>
be substantially to exhaustion, at room or ambient temperature (15 - 30°C), using a non-polar solvent such as hexane, the hexane extract being discarded and residual hexane in the solid plant material being removed by evaporation by drying the solid plant material at a temperature not exceeding 40°C. In this embodiment of the process the dried plant material, from which the hexane has been removed, will then be subjected to a further extraction, to obtain the pharmaceutically active constituents of the plant material, the further extraction also preferably being to exhaustion, using the selected polar solvent, such as dichloromethane. The dichloromethane, after the further extraction, may then be removed at a temperature not exceeding 40°C from the plant material to provide a dichloromethane extract of the plant material and to leave a dried solid plant residue, which is discarded. The dichloromethane extract may then be subjected to removal of tannin therefrom using Polyamide S, i.e. a polymer of an organic amide available from Riedei de Haen.<br>
D.anomala is a small and low-growing herb with small, stiff and bluish-grey leaves. It has a protea-like head of flowers which opens in mid-summer. The herb grows flat along the ground on North-facing rocky hillsides. It prefers full sun and well-drained soil and has been propagated from seed only. D.anomala is distributed from the Eastern Cape province in South Africa, through the KwaZulu-Natal-, Free State-, Gauteng-, Mpumalanga- and Northern provinces in South Africa, and into Zimbabwe and Lesotho. It is also found in Botswana, Namibia and thence to Zambia and Uganda in the North.<br>
For the purpose of the present invention, the Applicant has employed D.anomala roots collected from the Morifi and Mohales' hoek areas in Lesotho, from the Reitz area<br><br>
in the Free State, and from the Sikhukhuni ansa in the Northern province. Roots bought from herb markets in Durban, in the KwaZulu-Natal province, have also been investigated. The D.anomala used has been identified by voucher specimen No. 98142 deposited at the Bolus Herbarium at the University of Cape Town, in the Western Cape Province of South Africa.<br>
The dichlonomethane extract obtained as described above from D.anomala was found, after the tannin removal, to have substantial antiplasmodial activity which outweighs its cytotoxicity to an extent which indicates that it comprises a substance or composition suitable for the therapeutic or prophylactic treatment of malaria in the human or animal body.<br>
Thus, the dichioromethane extract of D.anomala was found to have plasmocidai effects both on the chloroquine-sensitive D10 strain and on the chloroquine-resistant FAC8 strain of P.falciparum, with IC* values of 2000ng/mf and 6000ng/mt for the D10 and FAC8 strains respectively. The applicant found the antiplasmodial activity of the dichioromethane extract to exceed the cytotoxic activity thereof with regard to a number of human cancer cell lines, by a factor of 10 (i.e. by an order of magnitude). In this regard the dichioromethane extract (and the sesquiterpenes displaying antiplasmodial activity discussed hereunder) were found to have an antiplasmodial selectivity index of about 10 on a number of cancer cell lines. The antiplasmodial selectivity index (SI antiplasmodial) can be expressed by:<br>
SI antiplasmodial = lC5Dantiplasmodiai / lC50cytotoxicity.<br><br>
After fractionating of the dichloromethane extract into a number of fractions and after testing the antiplasmodial activity of these fractions, it was found that antiplasmodiai activity is confined to those fractions which contain members of a series of asymmetrical sesquiterpene dimers whose molecular masses differed from one another by 18 atomic mass units (characteristic of several losses of water - H20), from a minimum molecular mass of 230 up to a maximum molecular mass of 539.<br>
In particular, antiplasmodial activity was found to be present in the fraction of the D.anomala dichloromethane extract which contains two asymmetrical sesquiterpene dimers having molecular masses respectively of 506.23879 atomic mass units and 508.23980 atomic mass units, these masses differing from each other substantially by 2 atomic mass units. The molecular ratio of the heavier compound to the lighter compound (i.e. of the 508.23980 atomic mass unit compound to the 506.23879 atomic mass unit compound) was found to be 1:3, as determined by their 1H spectra, liquid chromatography - mass spectroscopy (LC-MS) and by atmospheric pressure chemical ionization high resolution mass spectroscopy (APCI HRMS). The minor (heavier) of the two compounds was shown by APCI HRMS to have a highest molecular mass of M++l = 509.2545 atomic mass units, consistent with the empirical molecular formula of CsoHaeO?; while the major (lighter) compound had a highest molecular mass of M++1 = 507.2388 atomic mass units, determined by APCI ARMS, consistent with an empirical molecular formula of C30H34O7.<br>
The compounds of formulae C3t,H3607 or CaoH34O7 were found to have antiplasmodial activity against the chloroquine-sensitive (D10) strain of P.falciparum with<br><br>
an IC50 value of 200ng/m(!.  This amounted substantially to a 10-fold increase in activity over that of the crude dichloromethane extract.<br>
The dichloromethane extract of D.anomala was also tested in vitro against Gram negative bacteria and Gram positive bacteria and was found to be bactericidally active at minimum effect concentrations (MEC) of 250pg/mt, which is an indication of bacteriocidal activity against bacterial infections and utility in combatting bacterial infections.<br>
When the dichloromethane extract of D.anomala was tested for toxicity in test animals, no toxicity was found when the extract was administered at levels of up to 100mg/kg of body mass, and no morphological changes were found to the spleen, liver or kidneys of test animals. Toxicology was determined by death, hair-straightening as a ' sign of loss of well-being, and loss of body weight as a sign of loss of well-being. In respect of these parameters the test animals were found not to deviate from control animals.<br>
The active sesquiterpene compounds were concentrated employing solid phase extraction (SPE), using 10g C-18 end capped (EC) 70m£ Isolute cartridges. Cartridges were conditioned thrice with methanol and then thrice with water, followed by sample loading at 4mg/m£) (i.e. 200 mg/50 ml), followed in turn by percolation to obtain Fraction 1, by washing with 100% water to obtain Fraction 2, and by sequential cartridge-elution with 50ml mixtures of MeCN and water in the proportions given in the following table, Table 2, to obtain Fractions 3-12:<br><br><br>
Analytical high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) separations and preparative scale purification were carried out on the active sesquiterpene compounds using as the mobile phase mixtures of MeCN (0.05% by volume tetrafluoroacetic acid (TFA)) and water (0.05% by volume TFA), and using a gradient of 30-100 % MeCN in 40 minutes. The flow rates used.were 1 mi/minute for analysis and 50m#minute for preparative scale purification. The column used was a Phenomenex Prodigy - using ODS 2-type silica, C-18 and 5pm (particle size) (4.6 x 150mm); and the ultra-violet (UV) range for data collection was 200 - 600nm. The pure compounds had a maximum absorbance (X max) at a wavelength of 225nm. Sample strength was 10mg/t and injection volume was 50p£ for analytical separation and 500rrrt for preparative separation.<br>
With regard to structural elucidation of the active sesquiterpene compounds, mass spectra were obtained at the same time as the HLPC run, using a Thermo Quest LCQ (Finnegan) high resolution mass spectrometer connected inline with the high pressure liquid chromatograph. The liquid chromatograph/ mass spectrometer set-up was equipped with both electrospray ionization (ESI) and atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI) probes and an ion trap.<br><br>
Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra (1H, 13C, correlation spectroscopy (COSY), distortionless enhancement by polarization transfer (DEPT) -135), heteronuciear multiple quantum coherence (HMQC), and heteronuclear multiple bond quantum correlation (HMBC) were recorded on a Bruker-DR X-400 spectrometer (1H:400.13 MHz, 13C:100.62 MHz) and a Bruker-DRX-500 spectrometer with inverse detection and z-gradient equipment (1H:500.13 MHz, 13C:125.77MHz) at 23°C in CDCI3, The chemical shifts (5) were related to the signal of the residual solvent.<br>
The asymmetrical sesquiterpene antiplasmodially active dimer compounds of the D.anomala extract of the present conversion have been found to be no more than sparingly soluble and the bioavailability of the compounds will depend on such routes of the administration as are found to be possible (orally, rectally and intravenously), in principle formulation of the active compounds into one or more of capsules, tablets, syrups, injectable liquids and herbal tinctures (optionally stabilized) is possible, the formulation or formulations selected depending on bioavailability and pharmacokinetics of the compounds.<br>

Further, the invention extends also to the use of a substance or composition in the manufacture of a medicament or preparation for the therapeutic or prophylactic<br><br>
treatment of parasitic infections, in particular malarial infections such as P.faiciparum infections, of the human or animal body, the substance or composition comprising at least one asymmetrical sesquiterpene dimer having a molecular mass in the molecular range 230 - 539 atomic mass units.<br>

Figures 6-9 respectively show structural formulae of certain asymmetrical sesquiterpene dimers of the present invention.<br>
Figure 1 shows the UV spectrum of two of the active asymmetrical sesquiterpene dimers of the present invention, i.e. the asymmetrical sesquiterpene dimers, in solution in dichloromethane and at a concentration in total of 0.2%, in the ratios in which the dimers in question are present in the extracts from D.anomala, and in D.anomala itself, the dimers in question being those discussed above and having molecular masses best represented as 506.23879 atomic mass units and 508.23980 atomic mass units respectively.<br>

The invention will now be described, by way of non-limiting illustration, with reference to the following worked Examples.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
Plant material from D.anornala was authenticated and a voucher specimen [No. 98142] was deposited wfth regard to the plant material at the Bolus Herbarium of the University of Cape Town. The plant material was washed free of the fungal growth, bacterial growth and/or soil, and was dried at room temperature away from direct sunlight The plant material was then ground, using a plant grinder, to a particle size of at most 10(jm. The ground plant material was stored in dry cardboard boxes in a well-ventilated store prior to extraction.<br>
To carry out cold extractions on the plant material, 50Dg batches of ground dried plant material were weighed and extracted using 51 cold (room temperature) dichioromethane. The extraction was carried out over a period of 24 hours, accompanied by agitation/shaking at 130 rpm, after with the extraction mixture was filtered, and a further 51 cold dichioromethane was added for a further extraction cycle. The extraction cycles were repeated until the materia! was extracted to exhaustion, after which the filtrate obtained from each cycle was pooled, and the dichioromethane was removed by rotary evaporation at most 40°C, to leave the plant extract. The extract was<br><br>
then dried under a fume hood away from direct sunlight, after which yields were determined, and the dried extract was screened for antimalarial activity.<br>
Extracts which showed no antimalarial activity were discarded, and those with antimalarial activity had tannins and polyphenol compounds removed therefrom by dissolving 200mg of the dried dichloromethane extract in 100 ml methanol to which 5g of Poiyamide S (an organic amide polymer) powder was added, followed by thorough mixing and filtration under vacuum using a Buchner funnel. The residue was washed with a further 100rrrf of methanol, followed by a further said filtration, after which the methanol filtrates containing the tannin-free dissolved extract were pooled. The methanol was evaporated under vacuum and the tannin-free extract was dried under a fume hood.<br>
The residue remaining after the methanol extraction was washed twice with 20 mf batches of N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) to extract the tannin material from the residue. The DMF was then removed under vacuum and the remaining extract was dried under a fume hood.<br>
The dichloromethane extract, the methanol extract and the DMF extract were tested for antimalarial activity, and, except for the dichloromethane extract, were discarded.<br>
The dichloromethane extract was purified by a solid phase extraction (SPE), C-18 end capped SPE reverse phase cartridges being used, having a capacity of 10g and 70m£.   An amount of 200mg of the dried dichloromethane extract, from which tannins<br><br>
and polyphenolic compounds had been removed was prepared for the SPE extraction by complete dissolution thereof in 15m? of MeCN, the solution being centrifuged for 15 minutes at 13000 rpm, after which the supernatant liquid was decanted. Then 35rrrf of distilled de-ionized water was added to the supernatant liquid, followed by centrffuging for 15 minutes at 13000 rpm, followed by decanting and filtration of the supernatant liquid for use in the SPE.<br>
The SPE cartridges were conditioned by washing thrice with 50ml of MeCN, followed by washing thrice with 50ml of distilled de-ionized water. Sample loading at 4mg/ml was carried out by loading the 50ml solution obtained from the 200mg extract on each column. To each column a vacuum was gently applied after a one minute interval, to obtain a percolate which was collected as a first fraction. The percolate was concentrated by freeze drying. The cartridges were each then washed five times with 50ml aliquots (250m£ in total) of de-ionized water, the water then being removed by freeze drying, to leave a second or washed fraction.<br>
Cartridge elution was carried out by eluting each cartridge five times with 50ml aliquots (250ml in total) of solutions of MeCN mixed with water, in which the concentrations of MeCN and water were varied stepwise as shown hereinabove in Table 2, in which Fractions 3 - 12 are shown, Fractions 1 and 2 being the first and second fractions referred to above derived respectively from sample loading and cartridge washing.<br>
For testing the plant extracts, malaria parasites of the species P. falciparum were used, which had been maintained in culture flasks at37°C in an atmosphere comprising,<br><br>
by volume, 3% oxygen, 4% carbon dioxide and 93% nitrogen, prior to testing of the plant extracts. The parasites were cultured in a culture medium which was changed daily, and was diluted with fresh red blood cells every 2 - 3 days so that at least 5% of the red blood cells were infected at any time. Parasitemia was observed by means of Giemsa R66 stained thin smears. The smears were fixed with methanol and exposed to a 10% by mass solution of Giemsa-R66 in phosphate-buffered saline solution for ten minutes at room temperature. The thin smears were observed on slides which were rinsed under a stream of tap water and wiped dry with lint-free tissue prior to smearing. The slides were viewed under a light microscope with a 100X objective lens under oil having a viscosity of 1.250 centiStokes, and the parasitised red cells were counted.<br>
The plant extracts were prepared for use by reconstitution thereof, the dichloromethane extracts being initially dissolved in 10Qμ l of methanol, and then made up to 2ng/mJ with distilled de-ionized water. The stock solutions formed in this way were sterilised using 0.22pm sterile filter units followed by storage in a freezer at -1B°C until needed for screening.<br>
Microliter or microdilution plates were used, each consisting of 96 flat-bottomed wells arranged in eight rows (A - H) and twelve columns (1 - 12). A volume of 1 O0 p-C of the culture medium was pipetted into each well, except for the wells of column 3, into which 200μl of the reconstituted plant extract was pipetted. Two-fold serial dilutions were made of each extract from within the plate, using a multi-channel EppendorfF dispenser. Column 1 was reserved for a red blood cell blank and column 2 was reserved for a parasite control. A volume of 100μl of a 2% hematocrit (2% by mass of red blood cells) was pipetted into the wells of column 1, and 100μlof 2% hematocrit and<br><br>
100[μof 2% hematocrit with 2% parasitemia (i.e. 2% of the cells were parasitised) were added to the rest of the wells of the plate as a control. The effects of the methanol or other solvent on the parasites were tested, by placing the plates in an airtight desiccator flushed with a gas mixture, by volume, of 3% oxygen, 4% carbon dioxide and 90% nitrogen, in which the plates were incubated at 37°C for 48 hours.<br>
One of the microtrter/microdilution plates is illustrated in the following table, Table 3. Starting with column 3 in the plate and progressing to column 12, the amount of culture medium was successively halved (i.e. 100% in column 3( 50% in column 4, 25% in column 5 and so forth down to 0.1953% in column 12). The highest concentration of extract, in column 3, was 100 000ng/mland the lowest concentration, in column 12, was 195ng/mt The chloroquine was tested at concentrations of 200ng/mt - 0.39ng/mt As indicated above, column 1 was employed for a red blood cell blank, and column 2 was employed for a parasite control, a first sample being tested in rows A and B, a second sample being tested in rows C and D, a third sample being tested in rows E and F and a fourth sample being tested in rows G and H.<br><br><br>
For antiplasmodial screening a parasite lactate dehydrogenase assay was employed. The test plates were removed from the incubator, and their contents were re-suspended. The wells of another clean 96 well (8 rows x 12 columns) microtiter plate had 100p£ of Malstat™ reagent added thereto, for reacting with parasite lactate dehydrogenase. From each of the wells of each plate from the incubator 15pJ of liquid was transferred to the corresponding well in the microtiter plate containing the Malstat™<br><br>
reagent, and to each of these wells containing the Malstat™ reagent was added 25μl of a solution of 0.24mM (milliMoIar) phenyl ethyl sulphate (PES) and 1.96mM nitre blue tetrazoleum (NBT). The formation of a purple colour was an indication of parasite survival. Reaction of the Malstat™ was allowed to take place in the dark for 10 minutes, and absorbence at 620nm was read in a Mode! 7520 Microplate Reader manufactured by Cambridge Technology, Inc. Each plate had its well in column 1 containing only red blood cells blanked. The parasite percentage survival was calculated from the absorbence readings using the following formula:<br>
average reading of test wells - average reading of blank wells<br>
% parasite survival = 100 x	<br>
average reading of control wells - average reading of blank wells<br>
Dose response curves were prepared by plotting the absorbence readings against the concentrations of the extracts, and from these response curves, the IC» was in each case determined, by extrapolation, as the concentration that would inhibit 50% of the parasite population. If desired, standard deviations could be calculated from the absorbence readings.<br>
The extracts showing activity against the malaria parasites were subjected to cytotoxicity studies. Fully attached, confluent cells with a viability greater than 95% were used to assay cytotoxicity.<br>
Microdilution plates were prepared by diluting stock cultures of the extracts with the liquid medium thereof, to a density of 50 000 cells/mt, for use in the MTT cytotoxicity assay described hereunder. A volume of 200|Jt of the diluted stock culture containing 10<br><br>
000 cells was added to each well of a 96 well microdiiution plate having 8 rows and 12 columns, except for columns 1 and 2 which served as a blank and a parasite control respectively. Each plate was incubated at 37°C in an incubator which was continuously flushed with a carbon dioxide atmosphere. The plates were incubated until the cells became confluent.<br>
The extracts were prepared as described above for antiplasmodial screening. In each case the effect of the solvent used to dissolve the plant extract was tested on the cells.<br>
To determine cell viability the cells were trypsinized with a 5% by mass trypsin ethylene diamine tetracetic acid solution in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) to detach them from the flask in which they were contained. The cells were then spun at 1500 rpm for five minutes in a centrifuge, after which supernatant liquid was aspirated therefrom, and the cells were washed twice with the liquid used as their culture medium. The cells were then re-suspended in culture medium to obtain a ceil suspension, and an aliquot of the cell suspension was mixed with an equal volume of trypan blue. After thorough mixing a drop of the mixture was placed in a haematocytometer and covered with a cover slip. The cells were allowed to settle for two minutes, and a count of non-viable cells, namely those which stained blue, were made as a percentage, i.e. the number of cells that stained blue in each hundred cells.<br>
Cytotoxicity was then assayed. When the cells reached confluence, the medium was aspirated therefrom, and 5mi of said 5% trypsin ethylene diamine tetracetic acid was used to detach them.   The cell suspension was centrifuged at 2050 rpm for two<br><br>
minutes, after which the trypsin ethylene diamine tetracetic acid was aspirated and the cells were washed with culture medium. The number of viable cells was counted on a haematocytometer after staining the slide as described above, and the cells were seeded at 10 000 cells/well in the wells of a 96 well flat-bottomed microtiter plate. The cells were allowed to settle and attach for 24 hours, after which the culture medium was aspirated and fresh medium and test extracts were added. The cells were exposed serially to eleven half dilutions of the extracts for 48 hours.<br>
After the 48 hour incubation period 50pf of a 1mg/m{ solution of [3-(4y5-dimethylthiazoO-Z-yO^jS-dithemyl-tetrazoliumbromide (MTT) prepared in PBS in all of the wells. The plates were re-incubated for a further 4 hours at 37°C in an incubator, after which the plates were centrifuged at 2050 rpm for 10 minutes. The culture medium was aspirated in a fume hood. The assay is based on the reduction of the MTT to a purple insoluble formazan product by the reducing enzymes present only in metabolically active live organisms. Formazan crystals were obtained, and lOOpE of dimethylsulphoxide was added thereto in each well, after which the absorbence at 620 nm was read on the abovementioned Microplate Reader, from which cell survival was calculated.<br>
A selectivity index was employed to determine whether or not a given plant extract was to be regarded as cytotoxic or antiplasmodiai. To calculate the selectivity index the same units were used for cytotoxicity and antiplasmodiai concentrations, according to the following formula:<br><br><br>
Example 1 was repeated with regard to the dichlonomethane extract, except that the SPE cartridges were conditioned by washing once with 50 mt of methanol followed by washing once with 50 ml of distilled deionised water (instead of washing thrice with MeCN and then thrice with water as in Example 1). As in Example 1, 4mg/mf of crude extract was loaded on each column. Bound compounds were eluted at a rate of 17m£/minute and as detailed above in Table 2, i.e. with mobile phases comprising MeCN and water in the proportions shown in Table 2.<br>
Eluant Fraction 5, 6 and 7, comprising respectively 30% MeCN, 40% MeCN and 50% MeCN, ail by volume, contained respectively 0.56 ±0.065(jg/mt of extract, 0.55 ±0.12pg/mi of extract and 0.54 ±0.11pg/nrrf of extract. Each of Eluant Fractions 5, 6 and 7 showed more antimalarial activity than the crude dichloromethane extract.<br>
Pure compounds were obtained by collecting individual peaks from the 40% MeCN fraction (Eluant Fraction 6), which had a number of prominent peaks. A C18 HLPC Haisil 100 semi-preparative cartridge was used, having dimensions of (250 x 10mm) and a particle size of 5pm. A detection wavelength of 215nm was used, with a flow rate of 2.5 mi/minute, and an injection volume of 216p£, the mobile phase being an MeCN/water mixture comprising 60% MeCN by volume. This procedure resulted in the isolation of the compounds whose structural formulae are shown respectively in Figures<br><br>
6 and 7. The compound of Figure 6 was found to display an iC50 of 0.19μg/ml; and the compound of Figure 7 displayed an IC50 of 0.28pg/ml.<br>
EXAMPLE 3<br>
Example 1 was repeated with regard to the dichloromethane extract and, in addition to the compounds of Figure 2, the compounds of Figures 8 and 9 were isolated.<br>
The IC50 values of 0.19μg/ml and 0.28μg/ml respectively of the compounds of Figures 6 and 7 were an approximately ten-fold improvement over the antimalarial activity of the crude extract, being a two-fold to five-fold improvement over the respective fractions from which they were isolated. The compounds of Figures 6 and 7 displayed an antiplasmodiai selectivity index of 1/2, demonstrating twice as much cytotoxicity as antimalarial activity, but the compounds of Figures 6 and 7 were marginally more antimalarially active than the compounds of Figures 2, 8 and 9.<br>
It is expected that, for the purpose of treating persons suffering from malaria, the plant extract, or its active ingredients, will be capable of administration by way of one or more of capsules, tablets, syrups, injectable liquids, herbal tinctures (which may be standardised), suppositories, or the like.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
