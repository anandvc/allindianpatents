				<td>PHOTOCHROMIC OXAZINE COMPOUNDS AND METHODS FOR THEIR MANUFACTURE<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to oxazine compounds. In particular, the invention provides oxazine compounds and methods for their manufacture, which compounds are useful as photochromic compounds.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Various classes of photochromic compounds have been synthesized and suggested for use in applications in which reversible color changes or darkening is induced by sunlight. For example, spirooxazine and chromene compounds are known for excellent fatigue resistance. Additionally, photochromic 2,2-disubstituted [2H-l,4]-naphthoxazine compounds, such as those are disclosed in United States Patent No. 5,801,243, are known. These compounds have better fatigue resistance than chromene compounds, but are disadvantageous in that methods for their preparation are extremely limited. Thus, a need exists for additional photochromic oxazine compounds that overcome the disadvantages of the known compounds.<br>

2-(p-methoxyphenyI)-2-phenyl- phenanthrolino (5,6)-2H-fl,4J-oxazine<br>
and<br>
2,2-Bis(p-methoxyphenyl)-phenanthrolino (5,6)-2H-[l ,4]-oxazine.<br>
A mild synthetic methodology for preparing the oxazine compound of Formula I is shown below as Reaction A, wherein a disubstituted acrylic acid, a quinone, an azide source such as sodium azide, lithium azide, diphenylphosphoryl azide ("DPPA"), or trimethylsilylazide ("TMSA"), an organic base including, without limitation, triethylamine, diisopropyl amine, diisopropyl ethylamine, pyridine, piperidine, morpholine, N-alkyl morpholine, l,8-diazobicyclo[5,4,0Jundec-7-ene ("DBU"), and a trisubstituted arsen oxide such as triphenyl arsen oxide may be used as reacting agents. The disubstituted acrylic acid may be used to undergo a series of transformations to form aza-ylide intermediate, which may react with a quinone such as phenanthrene (9,10)-dione, phenanthroline(5,6)-dione, to form the desired photochromic oxazine<br>
The key intermediate of the reaction is a highly reactive isocyanate derivative. The isocyanate may be in situ generated from substituted acrylic azide which in turn may be formed in situ from substituted acrylic acid. The isocyanate is converted to aza-ylide in the presence of catalytic amount of tri-substituted arsen oxide including, without limitation, triphenyl arsen oxide. The arsen ylide reacts immediately with quinone derivative to form the desired oxazine compound and regenerated triphenyl arsen oxide. The generation of the isocyanate from acrylic acid may be conducted by rearrangement of carboxylic azide derivative generated from acid using various reagent combinations under various conditions known in the art including, without limitation, acyl chioride-sodium azide, chloroformate-sodium azide, DPPA, TMSA, in the presence of organic base inclduing, without limitation, triethylamine, diisopropyl amine, diisopropyl ethylamine, pyridine, piperidine, morpholine, N-alkyl morpholine, DBU, and the like. DPPA and TMSA, methyl<br>
chloroformate-sodium azide, and methyl chloroformate-lithiurn azide are preferred azide sources.<br>
One advantage of the above-described methodology is that all of the intermediates may be generated in situ, without purification. The reaction may be conducted either step-wise or, preferably, as a one-pot reaction. In the step-wise reaction, as shown in Reaction A, di-substituted acrylic acid is transformed into di-substituted acrylic acid chloride by treatment with acyl chloride such as thionyl chloride, acetyl chloride, or oxalyl chloride. The acrylic acid chloride is then treated with sodium azide or lithium azide to generate substituted acyl azide, or may be reacted with chloroformate such as methyl chloroformate in the presence of organic base to form mixed anhydride, then treated with sodium azide or lithium azide to generated substituted acyl azide.<br>
Alternatively, substituted acrylic azide may be obtained by reaction with DPPA or TMSA in the presence of organic base. The organic base may be a secondary or tertiary amine including, without limitation, triethylamine, diisopropyl amine, diisopropyl ethylamine, pyridine, piperidine, morpholine, N-alkyl morpholine, DBU, and the like. Upon heating, a arrangement of acyl azide occurs to form the isocyanate derivative of the compound of Formula III. The isocyanate derivative may be reacted with quinone such as phenanthrene(9,10)-dione or phenanthroline(5,6)-dione in the presence of catalytic amount of trisubstituted arsen oxide such as triphenyl arsen oxide to form the desired photochromic oxazine.<br>
The oxazine compounds may be obtained by more efficient, high yielding, one-pot methodology shown as Reaction B.<br>
In this method, the reaction may be conducted simply by mixing a substituted acrylic acid, an azide source, preferably DPPA or TMS azide, a mild organic base, such as triethylamine, diisopropyl amine, diisopropyl ethylamine, pyridine, piperidine, morpholine, N-alkyl morpholine, DBU, a quinone such as phenanthrene (9,10)-dione, phenanthroline(5,6)-dione, and a catalytic amount of triaryl arsen oxide such as triphenyl arsen oxide, in a suitable organic solvent under heating for a time sufficient to complete the reaction, usually between about 1 and about 15 hours.<br>
Reactive effective amounts of the mixture constituents are used meaning an amount suitable to produce the desired oxazine compound. The amount of trisubstituted arsen oxide may be about 1 mol percent to 20 mol percent, preferably about 2 to 10 mol percent, more preferably about 5 mol percent. The azide source such as DPPA and TMS azide is preferably used in about 1 to 5 equivalents compared with the di-substituted acrylic acid. The amount of organic base used may be about 1 to about 100 equivalents, preferably about 1 to 10 equivalents, more preferably about 2 to about 6 equivalents. Quinone such as phenanthrene (9,10)-dione, phenanthroline(5,6)-dione, may be used in about 0.5 to 1.5 equivalents, preferably about 0.6 to 0.8 equivalents. The preferred ratio of acrylic acid : azide source : base : quinone : triaryl arsenoxide is about 1:1.2:5 : 0.7 : 0.05.<br>
Useful organic solvents include, without limitation, benzene, dioxane, tetrahydofuran (THF), toluene, and xylene, and the like and mixtures thereof. Reaction temperatures will vary and typically range from about 40° C to about 150° C. In a preferred embodiment, the solvent is nonpolar benzene or toluene and the reaction condition is carried out at about 50 to about 110° C for about 1 to about 15 hours. More preferably, the solvent is toluene or benzene and the reaction is carried out at about 60 to about 80°C for about 2 to 4 hours.<br>
The substituted acrylic acid may be prepared by the either of two reactions, Reactions C and D, illustrated as follows. Reaction C<br>
Reaction C, a Hornor-Emmons reaction as described in Tetrahedron, 52(31), 10455-10472 (1996), may be conducted starting from a ketone of Formula V. The resulting 3,3-disubstituted acrylic acid ethyl ester of Formula IV may be hydrolyzed to form disubstituted acrylic acid of Formula II. A, A1 are the same as defined hereinabove.<br>
In reaction D, a ketone is reacted with acetonitrile in the presence of an excess amount of a suitable base including, without limitation, sodium hydroxide to form the 2,2-disubstituted acrylonitrile of Formula V. This process is described in J. Org. Chem., 44(25),'4640-4649 (1979). After hydrolyzation with the base in a suitable organic solvent, followed by acidification, the disubstituted acrylic acid of Formula II may be obtained.<br>
The oxazine compounds of the invention may be used singly, in combination, or in combination with other types of photochromic compounds, including without limitation naphthopyran and spirooxazines, or combinations thereof. The oxazines of the invention may be used in any applications in which organic photochromic substances are typically employed including, without limitation, ophthalmic lenses, windows, automotive transparencies, polymer films, and the like. The oxazines may be utilized in an organic solvent which solvent may be any suitable solvent including, without limitation, benzene, toluene, methyl ethylketone, acetone, ethanol, methanol, tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, ethyl acetate, ethylene glycol, xylene, cylcohexane, N-methyl pyrrol idinone, and the like and mixtures thereof.<br>
Alternatively, the oxazines may be used in an organic polymer host by various means. For example, the oxazine may be dissolved or dispersed into the host material and polymerized with other components of the host material. Alternatively, the oxazine may be incorporated into a coating applied to one surface of the host material. As yet another alternative, the oxazine may be imbibed into or coated onto a surface of the host material.<br>
Preferred host materials are optically clear plastics including, without limitation, polymers, copolymers, or a mixture of polymers. Exemplary host materials include, without limitation, poly(ally carbonate), polyepoxy, polyacrylates,<br>
polyethylene, polypropylene, polyvinyl chloride, polymethacrylates, poly (C1-C12)alkyl methacrylates, polyoxy(alkylene methacrylates, cellulose acetate, cellulose triacetate, cellulose acetate butyrate, acetyl cellulose, poly (vinyl acetate), poly (vinyl alcohol), polyurethanes, polythiourethane, polysiloxane, polyamide, polystyrene, and copolymers selected from the group consisting of acrylates, methacrylates, methyl methacrylates, ethylene glycol bis methacrylate, vinyl acetate, vinyl butyral, urethane, thiourethane, diethylene glycol bis(allylcarbonate), diethylene glycol dimethacrylate, diisopropenyl benzene, and the like.<br>
The amount of oxazine used is an amount such that the organic host material to which the photochromic compound, or mixture of compounds, is applied or in which they are incorporated exhibits the desired resultant color. Typically, within limits, the more oxazine used, the greater the color intensity. Generally, about 0.001 to about 20 % by weight of the polymer host is used.<br>
Nonphotochromic dyes may be used in conjunction with the oxazines of the invention to adjust the tint. Additionally, antioxidants, UV absorbents, anti-radical agents and the like may also be used to improve photochromic properties.<br>
In solution or in a polymer matrix, the oxazine compounds of the invention are colorless or pale yellow, and rapidly develop an intense coloration under UV irradiation. The oxazines will exhibit a wide range of color when activated by a source of ultraviolet radiation, from orange, reddish-orange, purple, to blue gray. A wide range of fading is also provided, the range being from one half hour to several seconds depending on the structure of the oxazine compound and solvent or matrix used.<br>
One particular advantage of the oxazine compounds of the present invention is that the absorption spectra of the colored form of the activated oxazine typically<br>
shows two or three absorption bands covering a wide range in visible spectra. For example, 2-(p-methoxyphenyl)-2-(p-piperidinophenyl)-phenanthro (9,10)-2H-[l,4]-oxazine, upon activation in organic solution or in polymer exhibits a gray color that fades quickly. The compound's UV-visible spectra showed three bands covered the whole visible region, which is ideal for application in sunglasses, spectacle lenses, and contact lenses.<br>
The invention will be clarified further by consideration of the following, non-limiting examples.<br>
Examples Example 1 Step 1.<br>
Into a 100 ml three-necked flask was charged solid KOH (3.30 g, 0.05 mole) and 25 ml acetonitrile under argon which was then heated to reflux. Benzophenone (9.1g, 0.05 mole) in 20 ml acetonitrile was added in a stream with stirring. After 8 hours refluxj the hot reaction solution was poured onto lOOg crushed ice and extracted with dichloromethane (3x15 ml). The combined organic extract was washed with water, dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, and filtered. Solvent was removed, the residue was purified by flash chromatography on silica gel (ether-hexane 1 : 5 as eluent), and 7.9 g of a colorless oil was obtained. Yield: 77%. 1HNMR showed the product to have a structure consistent with 3,3-diphenyl-acrylonitrile. 'HNMR (CDC13): 5 5.75 (s, 1H), 7.27-7.50 (m, 10H).<br>
Step 2.<br>
The 3,3-diphenyl-acrylonitrile (5.76g, 2.81 mmol) produced in Step 1 and sodium hydroxide (11.2g, 280 mmol) were refluxed in a mixture of ISO ml ethylene glycol and 1 ml water for 3 days. The reaction mixture was cooled and diluted with 100 ml water, acidified with 5 M hydrochloric acid until the pH was less than 1,<br>
filtered with suction and washed completely with water. The solid paste was dissolved in ethyl acetate, washed with dilute hydrochloric acid. The organic layer was separated and the aqueous layer was extracted twice with ethyl acetate. The combined ethyl acetate solution was dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, and filtered. Solvent was removed in vacuo until the total volume was approximately 40 ml. The solution was filtered through a short silica gel column and washed with ethyl acetate. After removal of the solvent in vacuo, the residue was titrated with a small volume of hexane-ethyl acetate (4 :1) and recrystallized from ethyl acetate/hexane. Colorless crystal (5.34g) was obtained. Yield: 84.8%. 'HNMR showed the product to have a structure consistent with 3,3-diphenylacrylic acid.

The oxazine compounds of the Examples were dissolved in organic solvent, then exposed to UV irradiation at 365 run for 15 seconds. The solutions developed an intense coloration and lost their color in the dark. The fading was expressed by the time that it took for one half of the optical density initially colored to disappear. The maximum absorptions in the visible region are given in the table below. The typical absorption spectra includes two bands: one below 470 ran and one above 490 nm. The relative intensity of the two band depends on the structure of the photochrome. The stronger the electron-donating ability of the substituents at the 2 position, the stronger the intensity of the absorption band at the longer wavelength.<br>
