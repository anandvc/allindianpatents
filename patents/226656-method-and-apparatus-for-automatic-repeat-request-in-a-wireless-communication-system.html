REVERSE LINK AUTOMATIC REPEAT REQUEST<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
Field<br>
[1001] The present invention relates generally to wireless communications, and more specifically to sending data in a wireless communication system.<br>
Background<br>
[1002]     The cdma2000 High Rate Packet Data Air Interface Specification<br>
published   as   TIA/EIA/IS-856,    and   more   specifically   the   QUALCOMM<br>
CDMA2000 1xEV-DO version, is an air interface optimized for the delivery of<br>
high-speed wireless data to mobile and fixed terminals.<br>
[1003]     In 1xEV-DO, an access terminal (AT) is a device with a radio modem<br>
and a data interface that allows the user to access a packet data network<br>
through the 1xEV-DO access network.  An AT is analogous to a Mobile Station<br>
in IS-41 cellular network.<br>
[1004] An Access Network (AN) is network equipment providing data connectivity between a packet-switched data network, for example, the Internet, and the ATs. As referred to herein, the AN can comprise a modem pool transceiver alone, and, additionally, other network equipment, for example, a modem pool controller.<br>
[1005] The forward link (FL) refers to communications from the AN to the AT. Correspondingly, the reverse link (RL) refers to communications from the AT to<br>
the AN.<br>
[1006] Muliipie ATs can be communicating within a sector covered by a single BTS. The AN is limited by a received threshold power. The received power is a function of the number of ATs in the sector and the data rate of each AT in the sector. An AT transmitting at high data rate transmits signals at a higher power man an AT transmitting at a low data rate. When an AN approaches its received threshold power, the AN can send a message on the reverse link activity channel to all ATs in the AN's sector to reduce transmit rate. The reduction in transmit rate can result in reduced throughput, and the limit of<br><br>
the  received  threshold  power  can be a  limiting factor on  the total  data throughput of the ATs in the sector.<br>
[1007]     A need therefore exists for a method and apparatus for increasing the data throughput in a sector.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
[1008]     FIG. 1 illustrates the transmission of signals between an AT and an<br>
AN;<br>
[1009]     FIG. 2 illustrates a method of data transmission by the AT;<br>
[1010]     FIG. 3 illustrates a method of data transmission by the AN; and<br>
[1011]     FIG. 4 illustrates a block diagram of an AT and an AN in a wireless<br>
communication system.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[1012] In a code division multiple access (CDMA) system that conforms to the "Tl A/El A/I S-95 Mobile Station-Base Station Compatibility Standard for Dual-Mode Wideband Spread Spectrum Cellular System," (IS-95) data packets can be retransmitted on the FL. A technique for FL transmission is described in U.S. Patent Application Number, "Method and Apparatus for High Rate Packet Data Transmission," Serial Number 08/963,386, filed November 3, 1997. For example, a data packet can comprise a predetermined number of data units, with each data unit identified by a sequence number. Upon incorrect reception of one or more data units by a mobile station, the mobile station can send a negative acknowledgment (NACK), on the RL ACK channel, indicating the sequence numbers of the missing data units for retransmission from the base station. The base station receives the NACK message and can retransmit the data units received in error.<br>
[1013] No such acknowledgement or retransmission exists for data transmission in the RL in a CDMA system.<br>
[1014] The transmission unit of the physical layer of Ix-EVDO is a physical layer packet. Data is contained in a physical layer packet. In the RL, physical layer packets are contained in frames.   Frames can be of 26.66 milliseconds<br><br>
fms) in duration.   A frame can comprise of 16 slots, with each slot 1.66 ms ir duration.<br>
[1015]     Data is modulated at varying data rates in  the  Reverse Traffic Channel. The data rates can be 9.6 kilobits per second (kbps), 19.2 kbps, 38.4 kbps, 76.8 kbps, and 153.6 kbps.  At data rates less than 76.8 kbps, data can be repeated in a frame.  For example, at 9.6 kbps: data can be sent in the first two slots of a frame, and the same data repeated 7 times in the next 14 slots of a 16-slot frame; at 19.2 kbps, the data can be sent in the first 4 slots of a frame, and then repeated 3 times in the next 12 slots of a 16-slot frame; at 38.4 kbps, the data can be sent in the first 8 slots of a frame, and then repeated once in the next 8 slots of a 16-slot frame.    Although data is not repeated in a frame for a data rate of 76.8 kbps, redundancy is provided by encoding, such as Turbo encoding, as encoding provides redundancy for data at other data rates. [1016]     The repetition of data within in a frame, and the redundancy provided by encoding, can advantageously be used to reduce the transmission of redundant data by individual ATs.   By reducing the amount of redundant data transmitted by an individual AT in a sector, the data throughput is effectively increased for the sector because the data is transmitted in a shorter duration. [1017]      For data rates less than 153.6 kbps, the 16-slot frame can be divided into 16/N sets of slots before transmission by the AT, where N can be 1, 2, 4, or 8.    For example, when N equals 2, the AT can transmit the first half of the frame (8 slots) to the AN and hold the second half of the frame in a queue for possible re-transmission of the data depending upon the successful decoding of the data of the first half of the frame as received by the AN. [1018]     Automatic repeat request (ARQ) refers to a protocol in which the receiver asks the transmitter to resend data.  Upon successful decoding of the first half of the frame, the AN can send an acknowledge message (ACK) to the AT to indicate that the AN has successfully decoded the data received in the first half of the frame. Upon unsuccessful decoding of the first half of the frame, the AN can send a negative acknowledge message (NAK) to the AT to indicate that the AN has not successfully decoded the data received in the first half of the frame.<br>
[1019]     ACK is a message transmitted to indicate that some data has been received correctly. Typically, if the sender does not receive the ACK message<br><br>
after some predetermined time, or receives a NAK me original data will be sent again.<br>
[1020] NAK is a message transmitted to indicate that some data has been received incorrectly, for example the data may have a checksum error. An alternative to sending a NAK is to use only ACK messages, in which case the non-receipt of an ACK after a certain time is counted as a NAK. As used herein, NAK refers to the receipt of a NAK message or the non-receipt of an ACK.<br>
[1021]     The ACK or NAK can be sent over a FL ACK channel.  In 1xEV-DO,<br>
the FL ACK channel can be introduced as a new MAC subchannel. The existing<br>
FL Medium Access Control (MAC) channel of 1xEV-DO includes a subchannel<br>
referred to as a Reverse Link Power Control (RPC) channel. The RPC channel<br>
uses binary phase-shift keying (BPSK) modulation for sending an RPC bit that<br>
requests the ATs in the sector to increase or decease their power.    The FL<br>
ACK channel can use BPSK modulation on the pr.ase orthogonal to the phase<br>
of the RPC channel.<br>
[1022]     Other techniques can be used to create the FL ACK channel.   There<br>
currently are 64 MAC subchannels.   Some of these subchannels can be used<br>
for the FL ACK channel.  In this example, the modulation phase of the FL ACK<br>
channel do not have to be orthogonal to the RPC channels.<br>
[1023]     When the AT is in a soft handoff, the ACK bit can be transmitted from<br>
only a serving sector or from all sectors in the ATs Active Set.<br>
[1024]     FIG. 1 illustrates the transmission of signals between an AT 102 and<br>
an AN 104 using an ARQ. The AT sends a first set of slots 106 of packet n.  In<br>
this example, the first set of slots comprises 8 slots. The first set of slots 114 of<br>
packet n are received by the AN.  Immediately after the first set of slots 106 of<br>
packet n are sent by the AT, a first set of slots 108 of packet n+1 are sent by the<br>
AT, and the first set of slots 116 of packet n+1 are received by the AN.<br>
[1025]     Also shown in FIG. 1, a first set of slots -.22 of a packet n-1 is sent by<br>
AT 102 prior to sending the first set of slots 106 of packet n, and a first set of<br>
slots 124 of the packet n-1 is received by AN 104.<br>
[1026]     Before   sending   a   next   set   of   slots,   the   AT   receives   an<br>
acknowledgement signal, ACK or NAK, from the AN, that indicates whether the<br>
first  set  of  slots   114   of   packet   n  has   been   successfully   decoded   or<br><br>
unsuccessfully decoded.  The acknowledgement signal informs the AT whether to resend the data, for example, by sending a second set of slots of packet n<br>
containing redundant data, or to send new datar for example, a first set of slots<br>
«<br>
from a packet n+2.<br>
[1027] In this example, an ACK 122 is sent by the AN to indicate that the first set of slots 114 of packet n has been successfully decoded. The AT receives the ACK, indicating that the first set of siots 110 of packet n+2 can be sent by the AT. The AN receives the first set of slots 118 of packet n+2. [1028] Before sending a next set of slots 112, the AT receives an acknowledgement signal, ACK or NAK, from the AN that indicates whether the first set of slots 116 of packet n+1 has been successfully decoded or unsuccessfully decoded. In this example, the AN sends a NAK. Based upon receipt of the NAK, the AT resends the data by sending a second set of slots 112 of packet n+1 containing redundant data. The AN receives the second set of slots 120 of packet n+1. The AN can combine the data contained in the first set of slots 116 of packet n+1 with the redundant data contained in the second set of slots 120 of packet n+1 and attempt to decode the data contained in the combined sets of slots. With the addition of the redundant data, the likelihood of successfully decoding the data is increased.<br>
[1029] One of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that the data throughput of the system has been increased by not transmitting the redundant data, that is, the second set of slots, when the AN has successfully decoded the data contained in the first set of slots. In this example of two sets of 8 slots, the data throughput can potentially be doubled.<br>
[1030] FIG. 2 illustrates a method of data transmission by the AT. At 202, the AT sends the first set of slots of a first packet to the AN. At 204, the AT sends the first set of slots of a second packet to the AN. One of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that when the packet is divided into more than two sets, for example, four sets of slots of four slots each, additional transmissions of first sets of packets can be performed before proceeding to 206. [1031] At 205. the AT determines whether an ACK or a NAK from the AN has been received by the AT. In this example, the ACK indicates that the first set of slots of the first packet has been successfully decoded by the AN, and the<br><br>
NAK indicates that the first set of slots of the first packet has not  been successfully decoded by the AN. -  {1032]     When the ACK has been received, the -T sends the first set of slots of a third packet at 210.   When the NAK has be^i received, the AT sends a second set of slots of the first packet at 208.<br>
[1033] The preceding example is for a packet tr.at is divided into two sets of eight slots. One of ordinary skill in the art will app-eciate that a packet can be divided into more than two halves.<br>
[1034] For example, if the packet is divided intc 'our sets of slots of four slots each, the AT can send a first set of slots of a first packet at 202, and then the AT can send a first set of slots of a second packet at 204. When an ACK is received by the AT corresponding to successful decoding of the first set of slots of the first packet by the AN at 206, the AT can send a first set of slots of a third packet at 210. When a NAK is received b. the AT corresponding to unsuccessful decoding of the first set of slots of :ne first packet by the AN at 206, the AT can send a second set of slots of the first packet at 208. [1035] Furthermore, when an ACK, corresponding to successful decoding of the first set of slots of the second packet by the AN (not shown), is received by the AT; the AT can either send (a) a first set of slc:s of a fourth packet provided that the first set of slots of the first packet was alsc successfully decoded, or (b) the first set of slots of the third packet provided that the first set of slots of the first packet was unsuccessfully decoded.<br>
[1036] When a NAK is received by the AT corresponding to unsuccessful decoding of the first set of slots of the second packet by the AN (not shown), the AT can send the second set of slots of the second zacket. [1037] The process can be continued similarly fcr other sets of slots. [1038] Additionally, the AT can sequentially send the first set of slots of the first packet at 202, the first set of slots of the second packet at 204. the first set of slots of the third packet (not shown) and the i.si set of slots of the fourth packet (not shown). The AN can receive the first three set of slots before sending an acknowledgement signal for the first set of slots of the first packet. When an ACK is received by the AT corresponding to successful decoding of the first set of slots of the first packet by the AN at 206, the AT can send a first set of slots of a fifth packet at 210.    When a NAK is received by the AT<br><br>
corresponding to unsuccessful decoding of the firs; set of slots of the first packet by the AN at 206, the AT can send the second se: of slots of the first packet at<br>
208.<br>
[1039] Furthermore, when an ACK is receiveo oy the AT corresponding fo successful decoding of the first set of slots of the second packet by the AN, the AT can send a first set of slots of a sixth packet (not shown). When a NAK is received by the AT corresponding to unsuccessful decoding of the first set of slots of the second packet by the AN, the AT can send the second set of slots of the second packet (not shown).<br>
[1040]     The process can be continued similarly for other sets of slots. [1041]     Moreover, one of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that other combinations of sending slots by the AT and sending acknowledgment signals by the AN can be made and fall within the scope of the appended claims. [1042]     FIG.   3   illustrates   a   method   of   da;a   transmission   by   the   AN corresponding to the method of data transmission by the AT shown in FIG. 2. [1043]     At 302, the AN receives the first set of slots of the first packet.   At 304, the AN receives.the first set of slots of the second packet. At 306, the AN attempts to decode the first set of slots of the first packet. Although the attempt to decode 306 is shown after the receipt of the first set of slots of the second -packet, the AN can attempt to decode the first set of slots of the first packet before or after the receipt of the first set of slots of the second packet, or in parallel with the receipt of the first set of slots of the second packet. [1044]     At 308, the AN determines whether the first set of slots of the first packet has been successfully decoded. When the AN is successful in decoding the first set of slots of the first packet, the AN sends an ACK to the AT at 310, and receives the first set of slots of the third packet at 312.   When the AN is unsuccessful in decoding the first set of slots of the first packet, the AN sends a NAK to the AT at 314, receives the second set of slots of the first packet at 316, and attempts to decode the combination of the first set of slots of the first packet and the second set of slots of the first packet at 315.<br>
[1045] The preceding example is for a packet tnat is divided into two sets of eight slots. One of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that a packet can be divided into more than two halves as described with reference to FIG. 2.<br><br>
[1046] The timing of the sending of the ACK o- the NAK can be independent of the number of sets of slots received. The AN can send the ACK or the NAK at a time after decoding a corresponding recei.ed set or sets of slots fo example, at 308, and before the AT needs the acknowledgement signal to make the determination to send a particular set of slo:s at 206. The timing of the sending of the ACK or the NAK can be independent of the interleaving of the sets of slots.<br>
[1047] FIG. 4 illustrates a block diagram of an AT 102 and an AN 104 in wireless communication system. Conventional hardware and software techniques can be employed by the AT and the AN. Both the AT and the AN can comprise a logic and processing unit 402 or ^04, respectively, and a radio frequency unit 406 and 408, respectively, for carrying out the above-described functionality. For example, one of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that the radio frequency units can send and receive sign=.s between the AN and AT, and that the logic and processing units can perform the logical operations and processing of signals.<br>
[1048] Although the foregoing description was made with specific reference to the 1xEV-DO communication system, the reverse link automatic repeat request can also be utilized in other CDMA systems.<br>
