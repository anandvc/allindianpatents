APPLICANTS<br><br>
ICONKAN RAILWAY CORPORATION LIMITED,<br>
OF BELAPUR BHAVAN, SECTOR II, OBD BELAPUR,<br>
NAVI MIMBAI - 400 614, ^[AHARASHTRA, INDIA. AN INDIAN COMPANY.<br><br>
The following Specification particularly describes the nature of this invention and the manner in which<br>
it is to be performed :-<br><br>
This invention relates to a derailment arrester means in an elevated suspended coach rail transportation system.<br>
Peirticularly, this invention relates to a transportation system, and more particularly to a system of capable of providing high capacity lateral transportation in downtown core areas.<br>
Particularly, this invention relates to derailment control safety device to be installed on the system in accordance with this invention.<br>
Other features of the transportation system are described in coÂ¬pending application Nos. 715/BOM/2001, 716/BOM/2001, 718/BOM/2001 and719/BOM/2001.<br>
All over the world, populations are rising and the infrastructure development is not keeping pace. The roads are unable to handle the rising number of vehicles and metro rails face inadequacies in increasing the capacity, besides the risk of vandalism and derailment. Expansions or new constructions need land in urban areas, which is not possible; alternative underground railways are too expensive. Transportation is a critical element in the smooth and efficient operation of almost every aspect of today's cities and urban areas. As a result, many types of transportation systems have been developed to move people and cargo from one place to another more efficiently. The most prominent transportation systems are overland travel by automobiles and bogies, both<br><br>
operating on roads such as public highways. Public buses utilize the same highway network, as do, to some extent, cable cars and electric buses. Conventional high capacity urban transportation systems generally employ underground trains or streetcars moving along conventional rails. Such systems take up a considerable amount of space in the urban area and do not allow the individual cars to be separately directed. Subways, monorails, and trains, however, utilize a rail network that is typically less developed than the surrounding highway networks. Other forms of inter-city transportation include the bicycle, auto rickshaws, scooters and motor cycles, all of which use the same roads. Consequently the roads are unable to handle the rising number of vehicles.<br>
Public buses also utilize the highway network, but are far less popular than automobiles. Buses are less favored than automobiles because one must often wait at a bus stop for a relatively long period of time and in potentially disagreeable weather. Further, buses are generally restricted to particular routes, and consequently a bus rider must walk, or acquire other transportation, to and from bus stops along various routes proximate to his origination and destination. Frequently, transfers must be made from one bus to another due to inadequate routes, and frequent interim stops must be made to load or unload other passengers. Still further, buses are subject to many of the same drawbacks as the automobile, such as traffic, stop lights, and traffic risk. As a result, buses are not as popular as the automobile even though, when properly utilized, buses are more efficient and less environmentally harmful than the<br><br>
cumulative    effect    of    so    many    individual    automobiles.<br>
Rail-guided vehicles, such as trains, monorails, and subw^ays, are an alternative transportation system found in many cities and urban areas. When properly utilized, such systems are more energy efficient than automobiles and less environmentally damaging. However, many of the same drawbacks exist for rail guided vehicles as for busses. For example, rail guided vehicle users are dependent upon predetermined and often inadequate schedules, a limited number of fixed routes, and lost time due to stops at intermediate stations for other passengers. Even the relatively high speeds attained by rail-guided vehicles do not fully compensate for the time lost in other ways when using such transportation systems. Surface railway is impossible to lay in an existing city. But even to lay the same in a new development is subject to negative implications. The development remains divided by the corridor and it a permanent noise polluter. Sudden disgorging of heavy loads of commuters at stations creates needless congestion on the roads reducing the quality of life. Several thousands of persons die annually because of trespassing or falling from trains. In addition derailments, collisions and capsizing cause serious damage to life and limb and property.<br>
Underground railway is less invasive on the surface but still poses technical challenges including the management of fires and evacuation. If road vehicles are involved in inter-modal transfers, it<br><br>
becomes a weak link in the chain of transport between walking and the railway.<br>
Elevated railway technically cannot reach congested central busy roads where mass transport is needed. It is too invasive and may require dislocation of some portions of the habitat as well as the system is very noisy.<br>
Consequently, cities and urban areas have been plagued by the problems associated with having private automobiles as the primary mode of civilian transportation. A person will readily spend hours in heavy traffic either because there is no alternative, or because any available alternatives require more time and inconvenience. Moreover, the pollution created by millions of private automobiles is having an immeasurable effect on the environment and quality of civilian life, not only in urban areas but in the surrounding rural areas as well. The cumulative energy wasted at stoplights and in traffic is considerable, and causes a direct increase in fiiel costs and other costs associated with automotive transportation. The energy required to accelerate an automobile that weighs several thousand kilograms is frequently converted into little more than friction within the automobile's braking system at the next traffic light. This is a considerable amount of wasted energy since the average human occupant in a typical automobile represents a mere 5% of the gross vehicle weight. Still further, dependence upon extremely large amounts of fossil fuels to power a large automotive transportation<br><br>
system makes such a society somewhat vulnerable to the whims of those who posses fossil fuel reserves.<br>
Clearly, then, there is a need for a civilian transportation system that is able to compete with the automobile in terms of convenience to the user, but does not require the tremendous energy consumption of an automotive transportation system. Further, such an improved transportation system should provide increased safety expectations, less overall cost to the user, and profitability to those manufacturing, owning, and operating such a system. All administrations are in search of an economical viable solution to the transportation problem, which is concomitantly environment-friendly.<br>
The present invention relates to a public transportation system that fulfills these needs and provides further related advantages. An object of the present invention is to provide a more versatile urban transportation system that has hitherto been impossible using systems of the prior art.<br>
The present invention relates to a novel suspended coach rail transportation system.<br>
Specifically, the present invention relates to a means of improving the safety levels of suspended coach rail transportation systems and more specifically, methods, means and devices to prevent the<br><br>
derailment of the bogies and bogie assemblies from the rails by external forces acting upon the bogie and to provide improved tractive capability.<br>
Single supporting rail suspended monorail systems have been built in the past. The potential of high-speed operation requires that the attitude of the cars is securely controlled and capsizing of the coaches and derailment of the bogies carrying the cars be prevented.<br>
SUMMARY OF INVENTION<br>
The principal objective of the present invention is to provide in a suspended coach transportation system that includes a bogie, that can operate inside a continuous box type closed horizontal beam having a slot in lower surface for the traverse of the coach body support, that will eliminate the possibility of derailment of the bogie due to forces acting upon the bogie, with or without including devices for controlling excessive swing of the coaches in the stationary state or during motion at high speed, an improvement in that novel derailment arrester means is provided on the bogie assembly/coach suspension.<br>
According to the present invention there is provided a derailment arrester means in an elevated suspended coach rail transportation system comprising an extended continuous hollow box way having a slot throughout its operative under wall, said box way being<br><br>
elevated by columns from the ground level and following the lay of the ground; a pair of rails fixed on either side of the slot on the operative inner surface of the under wall within the extended box way and extending continuously throughout the box way; a plurality of bogie assemblies moving on the said rails within the box way; removably mounted coaches suspended from suspension means extending through the slot in the box way, the bogie assemblies being connected to the coach suspension means in a manner that permits controlled longitudinal, swinging and angular displacement of the coaches and their suspension means, characterized the said derailment arrester adapted to prevent the displacement of the bogie wheels from the guiding rails consisting of in combination flanges from the running surface of the bogie wheels extending below the outer surface of the rails and a plurality of additional wheels mounted in housing on the suspender beam causing the suspender beam and bogie assembly to bear on the rails to prevent derailment.<br>
Typically, the box way is a concrete box way and an array of cenfral columns support two extending box ways on either side of the columns permitting traverse of suspended coaches along the box ways on either side and alongside of the columns, typically in opposite directions.<br>
In accordance with a preferred embodiment of this invention the box way has a generally rectangular or square cross section defined by a pair of horizontal and a pair of vertical walls typically of<br><br>
concrete said walls enclosing a space; one of said horizontal walls, typically the under wall of the box way defining a continuous slot.<br>
Typically, the extended box way is constructed by aligning and joining a plurality of pre fabricated box way segments secured to the columns.<br>
Typically, the box ways on either side of the columns are integral with each other.<br>
In accordance with a preferred embodiment of the invention, the columns are typically Im-diameter columns 8m high spaced apart by a distance of advantageously 15m with respect to each other and formed in the divider space between the carriageways on a roadway.<br>
Typically the coaches are suspended at a height of 2m to 4m above the road surface/ground level.<br>
Typically, the rails are fitted in an elastic medium dampened by inertia of measured mass.<br>
In accordance with a typical embodiment of the invention the conventional rails used for over ground railways are used as the guiding rails in the box ways.<br><br>
Typically in accordance with a preferred embodiment of this invention, the bogie is secured to a suspender beam via a connecting steel load transfer beam and spring loaded bolsters, to dampen the jerks and other movements from the rails to the bogie wheels. The bogies are also secured to the suspender beams via means of central pivots which permit controlled play and limited angular displacement of the bogie assembly on the suspender beam, if necessary.<br>
The coaches are suspended from the suspender beam by a plurality of suspender shafts. The shafts, in accordance with a preferred embodiment of this invention, consist of a plurality of typically four, discreet wire ropes fitted between and spanning the suspender beam joint and the coach roof coupling.<br>
The suspension shaft is secured to the suspender beam joint by means of cross pins which allow longitudinal motion of the shaft and the coaches suspended therefrom and at the same time the whole arrangement permits the coaches to swing in a controlled t manner in an axis perpendicular to the direction of travel of the coaches.<br>
The coaches are removably connected to the suspension shafts, which permits fast and efficient removal and replacement of the coaches with other coaches or with load carrying. Cargo carrying means, if desired.<br><br>
It is envisaged that the operation will be affected by air currents caused by movement of the coaches and surface winds. The forces from these air currents cannot be permitted to raise the light weight suspended coaches to the extent that the flanged bogie wheels can climb over the rails in the lateral direction.<br>
It is therefore an objective of the present invention to provide a bogie that can exert a greater normal force on the running rails to increase the traction available to ascend or descend steeper gradients than can be safely ascended or descended relying on the force provided by the weight of the car and bogie assembly alone. This added tractive capability will permit steel wheel cars on steel rails to safely negotiate the gradients commonly encountered in major thoroughfares built for automobiles.<br>
The second objective of increasing the gradability of the bogie is accomplished by using at least one auxiliary vertical wheel and actuator assembly against the under surface of the roof wall of the box way to create a downward force on the bogie and running wheels providing for additional traction between a smooth steel wheel on a smooth steel rail.<br>
Typically two such wheels are used which are isolated by the rest of the suspension mechanism by means of spring loaded/hydraulic and or pneumatic linkages which typically act as shock absorbers in addition to providing the basic function of derailment arresters.<br><br>
Thus an objective of the invention is to provide a transit system high slow speed automated people mover suspended coaches which uses at least one anti-derailment wheel as a vertically movable wheel to exert additional vertical reactive force on the two running rails .<br>
Yet another objective of the invention is that the anti-derailment device used in accordance with this invention is also functional in the inhibiting of vibration caused by the natural frequency of the bogies and the rails being excited by wheel movement by dampening the vibration. Unattenuated vibration creates noise and causes metal fatigue in structures.<br>

Referring to the drawings, Figure 1 shows a schematic sectional view of a suspended coach transportation system in accordance with this invention.<br>
The transportation system generally indicated by the reference numeral 10 comprises an extended continuous hollow box way 12 having a slot 14 throughout its operative under wall. Columns 16 elevate the box way 12 from the ground level and generally following the lay of the ground. A pair of rails 18 are fixed on either side of the slot 14 on the operative inner surface of the under wall within the extended box way 12. The rails extend continuously throughout the box way. A plurality of bogie assemblies 20 supported on bogie wheels 21 move on the said rails 18 within the box way 12.<br>
Removably mounted coaches 24 are suspended from suspender beams 30 via suspension means 26 extending through the slot 14 in the box way 12. The bogie assemblies 20 are generally connected to the coach suspender beams 30 in a manner that permits controlled longitudinal, swinging and angular displacement of the coaches 24 and their suspension means.<br>
The box way 12 is a concrete box way and an array of central columns 16 support two extending box ways on either side of the<br><br>
columns as seen in Figure 1. These box ways 12 permit traverse of suspended coaches along the box ways on either side and alongside of the columns, typically in opposite directions.<br>
As seen in the Figures, the box way 12 has a generally rectangular or square cross section defined by a pair of horizontal and a pair of vertical walls typically of concrete said walls enclosing a space; one of said horizontal walls, typically the under wall of the box way defining a continuous slot 14.<br>
The extended box way is constructed by aligning and joining a plurality of pre fabricated box way segments secured to the columns. The box ways on either side of the columns are integral with each other.<br>
The columns 16 are typically Im-diameter columns 8m high spaced apart by a distance of advantageously 15m with respect to each other and formed in the divider space between the carriageways on a roadway.<br>
Typically the coaches 24 are suspended at a height of 2m to 4m above the road swface/ground level.<br>
The rails 18 are fitted in an elastic medium dampened by inertia of measured mass .<br><br>
Conventional rails used for over ground railways are used as the guiding rails in the box ways.<br>
An electric current delivering rail 27 is fitted on one of the walls of the box way and running through its length. Typically an insulated wheel or other device[not shown] will run against this power supplying rail effectively collecting current to power motors, preferably linear induction motors cooperating with the bogie assemblies. A fourth continuous rail [not shown] mounted on the inner surface of one of the walls of the box way is provided to cooperate with the linear induction motors associated with the bogie assemblies 20.<br>
Referring to Figures 3 to 6: Figure 3 is the schematic detailed view of the inter action between the steel rails 18 and the steel wheels 21. Figure 4 shows the schematic sectional view of the anti derailment device in accordance with this invention. Figure 5 shows the schematic sectional view of the details of the anti derailment device shown in Figure 4, and Figure 6 shows the plan view of the anti derailment device seen in Figure 4.<br>
As seen in Figure 3 the profile of the operating surface of the railway wheel is defined by a running surface 'a' and an adjacent flange 'b' typically 8 to 25 inches in length. In turn the running surface and the flange are defined by three standardized parameters: flange height flange thickness and rim thickness. Thus the Steel Wheel profile includes several sections. A flange section protrudes<br><br>
downward from the side of the train wheel and extends over the lateral side of the rail. A fillet [not shown] extends upward along a field side of the flange providing transition to a straight conical wheel tread section. The wheel tread section serves as the major load bearing surface that supports the train wheels on the rail. The art uses tread profile of two opposing wheel on one of two rails to steer. Two opposing wheels are a wheel set. The flange provides steering when rail curve exceeds capability of treads to steer without flange contact, which may cause derailment. Two main factors have to be considered when designing wheel profiles for use with railed devices. The first is the dynamic stability of the suspended coaches and bogie assembly at various speeds throughout its operating speed range. When in transit, a suspended coach train experiences lateral oscillations known as "hunting". Wheel hunting results in the wheels oscillating laterally back and forth between the wheel flanges. The maximum speed or critical speed of the bogie assembly is determined by the onset of unstable, undesirable wheel set hunting. For example, if the bogie assembly goes too fast, the force of the lateral oscillations will overcome the flange barrier and cause the bogie assembly to derail. Hunting is caused by the dynamics between the wheel tread profile and the rail. Increasing the slope of the wheel tread too fast toward flange increases forces causing hunting and, therefore, lowers the critical speed of the vehicle. Decreasing slope of wheel tread toward flange decreases steering forces, also lowering the critical hunting speed.<br><br>
A second factor involved with stability is the ability of the suspended coach to negotiate track curves. This curving ability is determined primarily by the ability of the opposing wheels of a wheel sets to follow the track curves. Optimally, the wheel sets should perform a purely rolling motion in the track curves without any contact between the wheel flanges and the rails. This requires steering forces to be generated by the sloped wheel tread independently of the wheel flange permitting the wheel set to yaw or rotate about a vertical axis which may be through its centre. Oscillation of steering forces happen around vertical axis through its centre of gravity (mass). This oscillation is a metric space. The oscillation of wheel set results in hunting. The steering forces move the bogie assembly wheel sets into a more radial position with respect to the track curves, thus, increasing bogie assembly stability around curves.<br>
A wheel set includes two opposite wheels that may be joined together by an axle. With a conical (straight taper) wheel tread [ typically as shown in Figure 3 ]the conicity remains virtually constant with lateral deflection of a wheel set relative to the rails. That is, straight taper wheel treads have a constant slope. In other words, the conicity of each wheel remains the same irrespective of whether the wheel set runs centrally on the track or is deflected closer to one rail. Increasing the conicity of the wheel tread improves the steering ability of the wheel set because of the increased steering force. However, increased conicity also increases the oscillation of the wheel set. Oscillation of wheel set results in<br><br>
hunting. Therefore, with regard to the conicity of wheel treads, there is a conflict between the requirement for hunting stability and increased speed and for good curving ability of the wheel sets.<br>
Figure 4 shows a general arrangement of the derailment arrester means 70 typically in the form of solid rubber wheels secured with spring loaded isolator means on the suspender beam 30. The typical arrangement scheme is seen in Figure 5 showing the rubber wheels 72 fitted in the isolator spring loaded means 76 which may hydraulic, mechanical or pneumatic and in the form of shock absorbers. The gap 'c" between the wheels 72 and the inner surface 74 of the box way is critically set, characterized in that in the normal operation of the movement of the wheel set of the bogie assembly on the rails 18 the derailment arrester wheels 72 will not contact the inner surface 72. Contact will happen only when a turning moment is applied to the wheel set and a jumping of the wheels of the rails 18 is attempted. At this time the wheels 72 will bear on the surface 74 and in turn exert a reactive bearing force on the wheel set and typically the flange portion enforcing contact between the wheel set and the rails 18 and preventing and arresting derailment.<br>
As seen in the plan view four derailment arrester means with their corresponding wheels 72 are fitted on each bogie assembly.<br>
Although the invention has been described in terms of particular embodiments and applications, one of ordinary skill in the art, in<br><br>
light of this teaching, can generate additional embodiments and modifications without departing fi:om the spirit of or exceeding the scope of the invention. Accordingly, it is to be understood that the drawings and descriptions herein are proffered by way of example to facilitate comprehension of the invention and should not be construed to limit the scope thereof.   .<br><br>
