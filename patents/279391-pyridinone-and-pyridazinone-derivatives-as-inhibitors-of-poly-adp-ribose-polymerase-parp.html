				<td>The present invention relates to Pyridinone and Pyridazinone Derivatives as Inhibitors of Poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase (PARP)<br>
The present invention relates to pyridinone and pyridazinone derivatives which are inhibitors of the enzyme poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase (PARP), previously known as poly(ADP-ribose)synthase and poly(ADP-ribosyl)transferase. The compounds of the present invention are useful as mono-therapies in tumors with specific defects in DNA-repair pathways and as enhancers of certain DNA-damaging agents such as anticancer agents and radiotherapy. Further, the compounds of the present invention are useful for reducing cell necrosis (in stroke and myocardial infarction), down regulating inflammation and tissue injury, treating retroviral infections and protecting against the toxicity of chemotherapy.<br>
Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) constitute a super family of eighteen proteins containing PARP catalytic domains (Bioessays (2004) 26:1148). These proteins include PARP-1, PARP-2, PARP-3, tankyrase-1, tankyrase-2, vaultPARP and TiPARP. PARP-1, the founding member, consists of three main domains: an amino (N)-terminal DNA-binding domain (DBD) containing two zinc fingers, the automodification domain, and a carboxy (C)-terminal catalytic domain.<br>
PARP are nuclear and cytoplasmic enzymes that cleave NAD+ to nicotinamide and ADP-ribose to form long and branched ADP-ribose polymers on target proteins, including topoisomerases, histones and PARP itself (Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. (1998) 245:1-10).<br>
Poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation has been implicated in several biological processes, including DNA repair, gene transcription, cell cycle progression, cell death, chromatin functions and genomic stability.<br>
The catalytic activity of PARP-1 and PARP-2 has been shown to be promptly stimulated by DNA strand breakages (see Pharmacological Research (2005) 52:25-33). In response to DNA damage, PARP-1 binds to single and double DNA nicks. Under normal physiological conditions there is minimal PARP activity, however, upon DNA damage an immediate activation of PARP activity of up to 500-fold occurs. Both PARP-1 and PARP-2 detect DNA strand interruptions acting as nick sensors, providing rapid signals to halt transcription and recruiting the enzymes required for DNA repair at the site of damage. Since radiotherapy and many chemotherapeutic approaches to cancer therapy<br>
act by inducing DNA damage, PARP inhibitors are useful as chemo- and radiosensitizers for cancer treatment. PARP inhibitors have been reported to be effective in radio sensitizing hypoxic tumor cells (US 5,032,617, US 5,215,738 and US 5,041,653).<br>
Most of the biological effects of PARP relate to this poly (ADP-ribosyl)ation process which influences the properties and function of the target proteins; to the PAR oligomers that, when cleaved from poly(ADP-ribosyl)ated protein's, confer distinct cellular effects; the physical association of PARP with nuclear proteins to form functional complexes; and the lowering of the cellular level of its substrate NAD+ (Nature Review (2005) 4:421-440).<br>
Besides being involved in DNA repair, PARP may also act as a mediator of cell death. Its excessive activation in pathological conditions such as ischemia and reperfusion injury can result in substantial depletion of the intercellular NAD+, which can lead to the impairment of several NAD+ dependent metabolic pathways and result in cell death (see Pharmacological Research (2005) 52:44-59). As a result of PARP activation, NAD+ levels significantly decline. Extensive PARP activation leads to severe depletion of NAD+ in cells suffering from massive DNA damage. The short half-life of poly(ADP-ribose) results in a rapid turnover rate, as once poly(ADP-ribose) is formed, it is quickly degraded by the constitutively active poly(ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase (PARG). PARP and PARC form a cycle that converts a large amount of NAD+ to ADP-ribose, causing a drop of NAD"1" and ATP to less than 20% of the normal level. Such a scenario is especially detrimental during ischemia when deprivation of oxygen has already drastically compromised cellular energy output. Subsequent free radical production during reperfusion is assumed to be a major cause of tissue damage. Part of the ATP drop, which is typical in many organs during ischemia and reperfusion, could be linked to NAD+ depletion due to poly(ADP-ribose) turnover. Thus, PARP inhibition is expected to preserve the cellular energy level thereby potentiating the survival of ischemic tissues after insult. Compounds which are inhibitors of PARP are therefore useful for treating conditions which result from PARP mediated cell death, including neurological conditions such as stroke, trauma and Parkinson's disease.<br>
PARP inhibitors have been demonstrated as being useful for the specific killing of BRCA-1 and BRCA-2 deficient tumors (Nature (2005) 434:913-916 and 917-921; and Cancer Biology &amp; Therapy (2005) 4:934-936).<br>
-PARP inhibitors have been demonstrated    to be selective in killing cells with defects in ATM, DNA_PK or KU80 (Nucleic Acid Research (2006) 34:1685-1691).<br>
PARP inhibitors have been shown to enhance the efficacy of anticancer drugs (Pharmacological Research (2005) 52:25-33), including platinum compounds such as cisplatin and carbbplatin (Cancer Chemother Pharmacol (1993) 33:157-162 and Mot Cancer Ther (2003) 2:371-382). PARP inhibitors have been shown to increase the antitumor activity of topoisomerase I inhibitors such as Irinotecan and Topotecan (MoI Cancer Ther (2003) 2:371-382; and Clin Cancer Res (2000) 6:2860-2867) and this has been demonstrated in in vivo models (J Natl Cancer Inst (2004) 96:56-67).<br>
PARP inhibitors have been shown to restore susceptibility to the cytotoxic and antiproliferative effects of temozolomide (TMZ) (see Curr Med Chem (2002) 9:1285-1301 andMed Chem Rev Online (2004) 1:144-150). This has been demonstrated in a number of in vitro models (Br J Cancer (1995) 72:849-856; Br J Cancer (1996) 74:1030-1036; Mol Pharmacol (1997) 52:249-258; Leukemia (1999) 13:901-909; Glia (2002) 40:44-54; and Clin Cancer Res (2000) 6:2860-2867 and (2004) 10:881-889) and in vivo models (Blood (2002) 99:2241-2244; Clin Cancer Res (2003) 9:5370-5379 and J Natl Cancer Inst (2004) 96:56-67). PAPR inhibitors have also been shown to prevent the appearance of necrosis induced by selective AG-adenine methylating agents such as MeOSO2(CH2)-lexitropsin (Me-Lex) (Pharmacological Research (2005) 52:25-33).<br>
PARP inhibitors have been shown to act as radiation sensitizers. PARP inhibitors have been reported to be effective in radiosensitizing (hypoxic) tumor cells and effective in preventing tumor cells from recovering from potentially lethal (Br. J. Cancer (1984) 49(Suppl. VI):34-42; and Int. J. Radial. Bioi. (1999) 75:91-100) and sub-lethal (Clin. Oncol. (2004) 16(l):29-39) damage of DNA after radiation therapy, presumably by their ability to prevent DNA strand break rejoining and by affecting several DNA damage signaling pathways.<br>
PARP inhibitors have also been shown to be useful for treating acute and chronic myocardial diseases (see Pharmacological Research (2005) 52:34-43). For instance, it has been demonstrated that single injections of PARP inhibitors have reduced the infarct size caused by ischemia and reperfusion of the heart or skeletal muscle in rabbits. In these studies, a single injection of 3-amino-benzamide (10 mg/kg), either one minute before occlusion or one minute before reperfusion, caused similar reductions in infarct size in the heart (32-42%) while 1,5-dihydroxyisoquinoline (1 mg/kg), another PARP inhibitor,<br>
reduced infarct size by a comparable degree (38-48%). These results make it reasonable to assume that PARP inhibitors could salvage previously ischemic heart or reperfusion injury of skeletal muscle tissue (PNAS (1997) 94:679-683). Similar findings have also been reported in pigs (Eur. J. Pharmacol. (1998) 359:143-150 and Ann. Thorac. Surg. (2002) 73:575-581) and in dogs (Shock. (2004) 21:426-32).<br>
PARP inhibitors have been demonstrated as being useful for treating certain vascular diseases, septic shock, ischemic injury arid neurotoxicity (Biochim. Biophys. Acta (1989) 1014:1-7; J. Clin. Invest. (1997) 100: 723-735). Oxygen radical DNA damage that leads to strand breaks in DNA, which are subsequently recognized by PARP, is a major contributing factor to such disease states as shown by PARP inhibitor studies (/. Neurosci. Res. (1994) 39:38-46 and PNAS (1996) 93:4688-4692). PARP has also been demonstrated to play a role in the pathogenesis of hemorrhagic shock (PNAS (2000) 97:10203-10208).<br>
PARP inhibitors have been demonstrated as being useful for treatment of inflammation diseases (see Pharmacological Research (2005) 52:72-82 and 83-92).<br>
It has also been demonstrated that efficient retroviral infection of mammalian cells is blocked by the inhibition of PARP activity. Such inhibition of recombinant retroviral vector infections has been shown to occur in various different cell types (J. Virology, (1996) 70(6):3992-4000). Inhibitors of PARP have thus been developed for use in antiviral therapies and in cancer treatment (WO 91/18591).<br>
In vitro and in vivo experiments have demonstrated that PARP inhibitors can be used for the treatment or prevention of autoimmune diseases such as Type I diabetes and diabetic complications (Pharmacological Research (2005) 52:60-71).<br>
PARP inhibition has been speculated as delaying the onset of aging characteristics in human fibroblasts (Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. (1994) 201(2):665-672 and Pharmacological Research (2005) 52:93-99). This may be related to the role that PARP plays in controlling telomere function (Nature Gen., (1999) 23(1):76-80).<br>
The vast majority of PARP inhibitors to date interact with the nicotinamide binding domain of the enzyme and behave as competitive inhibitors with respect to NAD+ (Expert Opin. Ther. Patents (2004) 14:1531-1551). Structural analogues of nicotinamide, such as benzamide and derivatives were among the first compounds to be investigated as PARP inhibitors. However, these molecules have a weak inhibitory activity and possess other effects unrelated to- PARP inhibition. Thus, there is a need to provide potent inhibitors of the PARP enzyme.<br>
US 2005/0234236 describes a process for the synthesis of pyridazinones, WO2004/085406 decribes benzyl-pyridazinones as reverse transcriptase inhibitors and EPOS 10218 describes benzyl-pyridazinones as COX I and COX II inhibitors.<br>
It has now surprisingly been discovered that pyridinone and pyridazinone derivatives of the present invention exhibit high levels of inibition of the activity of PARP.<br>
The compounds of this invention are useful in the inhibition of poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase (PARP). They are particularly useful as inhibitors of PARP-1 and/or PARP-2. The present invention provides the use of a compound of formula I:<br>

Conventional procedures for the selection and preparation of suitable prodrug derivatives are described, for example, in "Design of Prodrugs", ed. H. Bundgaard, Elsevier, 1985.<br>
A prodrug may be a pharmacologically inactive derivative of a biologically active substance (the "parent drug" or "parent molecule") that requires transformation within the body in order to release the active drug, and that has improved delivery properties over the parent drug molecule. The transformation in vivo may be, for example, as the result of some metabolic process, such as chemical or enzymatic hydrolysis of a carboxylic, phosphoric or sulphate ester, or reduction or oxidation of a susceptible functionality.<br>
The present invention includes within its scope solvates of the compounds of formula I and salts thereof, for example, hydrates.<br>
The compounds of the present invention may have asymmetric centers, chiral axes, and chiral planes (as described in: E.L. Eliel and S.H. Wilen, Stereochemistry of Carbon Compounds, John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York, 1994, pages 1119-1190), and occur as racemates, racemic mixtures, and as individual diastereomers, with all possible isomers and mixtures thereof, including optical isomers, all such stereoisomers being included in the present invention.<br>
The compounds disclosed herein may exist as tautomers and both tautomeric forms are intended to be encompassed by the scope of the invention, even though only one tautomeric structure may be depicted. For example, compounds of formula I may tautomerise into compounds of the following structure:<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
The compounds may exist in different isomeric forms, all of which are encompassed by the present invention.<br>
The compounds may exist in a number of different polymorphic forms.<br>
When any variable (e.g. R1 and R~, etc.) occurs more than one time in any constituent, its definition on each occurrence is independent at every other occurrence. Also, combinations of substituents and variables are permissible only if such combinations result in stable compounds. Lines drawn into the ring systems from substituents represent that the indicated bond may be attached to any of the substitutable ring atoms.<br>
It is understood that substituents and substitution patterns on the compounds of the instant invention can be selected by one of ordinary skill in the art to provide compounds that are chemically stable and that can be readily synthesized by techniques known in the art, as well as those methods set forth below, from readily available starting materials. If a substituent is itself substituted with more than one group, it is understood that these multiple groups may be on the same carbon or on different carbons, so long as a stable structure results. The phrase "optionally substituted" should be taken to be equivalent to the phrase "unsubstituted or substituted with one or more substituents" and in such cases the preferred embodiment will have from zero to three substituents. More particularly, there are zero to two substituents. A substituent on a saturated, partially saturated or unsaturated heterocycle can be attached at any substitutable position.<br>
As used herein, "alkyl" is intended to include both branched, straight-chain and cyclic saturated aliphatic hydrocarbon groups having the specified number of carbon atoms. For example,"C1-6alkyl" is defined to include groups having 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6<br>
carbons in. a linear, branched or cyclic arrangement. For example,"C1-6alkyl" specifically includes methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, i-propyl, n-butyl, t-butyl, i-butyl, pentyl, hexyl, cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl and cyclohexyl and so on. Preferred alkyl groups are methyl and ethyl. The term "cycloalkyl" means a monocyclic, bicyclic or polycyclic saturated aliphatic hydrocarbon group having the specified number of carbon atoms. For example, "C3-7cycloalkyl" includes cyclopropyl, methyl-cyclopropyl, 2,2-dimethyl: cyclobutyl, 2-ethyl-cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, and so on. In an embodiment of the invention the term "cycloalkyl" includes the groups described immediately above and further includes monocyclic unsaturated aliphatic hydrocarbon groups. For example, "cycloalkyl" as defined in this embodiment includes cyclopropyl, methyl-cyclopropyl, 2,2-dimethyl-cyclobutyl, 2-ethyl-cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, cyclopentenyl, cyclobutenyl, 7,7-dimethylbicyclo[2.2.1]heptyl and so on.

The activity of one or more components of the HR dependent DNA DSB repair pathway may be abolished in the one or more cancer cells of an individual having a cancer which is deficient in HR dependent DNA DSB repair. Components of the HR dependent DNA DSB repair pathway are well characterized in the art (see for example, Science (2001) 291:1284-1289) and include the components listed above.<br>
The present invention provides a compound of formula I for use in the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment or prevention of a cancer which is deficient in HR dependent DNA DSB repair activity.<br>
The present invention also provides a method for the treatment or prevention of a cancer which is deficient in HR dependent DNA DSB repair activity, which method<br>
comprises administration to .a patient in need thereof of an effective amount of a compound of formula I or a composition comprising a compound of formula I<br>
In an embodiment the cancer cells are deficient in the HR dependent DNA DSB repair activity of one or more phenotypes selected from ATM (NM-000051), RAD51 (NM-002875), RAD51 LI (NM-002877), RAD51C (NM-002876), RAD51L3 (NM-002878), DMC1 (NM-007068), XRCC2 (NM7005431), XRCC3 (NM-005432), RAD52 (NM-002879), RAD54L (NM-003579), RAD54B (NM-012415), BRCA-1 (NM-007295), BRCA-2 (NM-000059), RAD5O (NM-005732), MREI 1A (NM-005590), NBS1 (NM-002485), ADPRT (PARP-1), ADPRTL2 (PARP-2), CTPS, RPA, RPA1, RPA2, RPA3, XPD, ERCC1, XPF, MMS19, RADSlp, RAD51D,DMC1, XRCCR, RAD50, MRE11, NB51, WRN, BLMKU70, RU80, ATRCHK1, CHK2, FANCA, FANCB, FANCC, FANCD1, FANCD2, FANCE, FANCF, FANCG, RAD1 and RAD9.<br>
In another embodiment, the cancer cells have a BRCA1 and/or a BRCA2 deficient phenotype. Cancer cells with this phenotype may be deficient in BRCA1 and/or BRCA2, i. e. expression and/or activity of BRCA1 and/or BRCA2 may be reduced or abolished in the cancer cells, for example by means of mutation or polymorphism in the encoding nucleic acid, or by means of amplification, mutation or polymorphism in a gene encoding a regulatory factor, for example the EMSY gene which encodes a BRCA2 regulatory factor (Cell (2003) 115:523-535).<br>
BRCA-1 and BRCA-2 are known tumor suppressors whose wild-type alleles are frequently lost in tumors of heterozygous carriers (Oncogene, (2002) 21(58):8981-93; Trends Mol Med., (2002) 8(12):571-6). The association of BRCA-1 and/or BRCA-2 mutations with breast cancer has been well-characterized (Exp Clin Cancer Res., (2002) 21 (3 Suppl):9-l2). Amplification of the EMSY gene, which encodes a BRCA-2 binding factor, is also known to be associated with breast and ovarian cancer. Carriers of mutations in BRCA-1 and/or BRCA-2 are also at elevated risk of cancer of the ovary, prostate and pancreas. The detection of variation in BRCA-1 and BRCA-2 is well-known in the art and is described, for example in EP 699 754, EP 705 903, Genet. Test (1992) 1:75-83; Cancer Treat Res (2002) 107:29-59; Neoplasm (2003) 50(4):246-50; Ceska Gynekol (2003) 68(1): 11-16). Determination of amplification of the BRCA-2 binding factor EMSY is described in Cell 115:523-535. PARP inhibitors have been demonstrated as being useful for the specific killing of BRCA-1 and BRCA-2 deficient tumors (Nature (2005) 434:913-916 and 917-920).<br>
Thus, the present invention provides a compound of formula I for use in the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment or prevention of BRCA-1 or BRCA-2 deficient tumors.<br>
The present invention also provides a method for the treatment or prevention of BRCA-1 or BRCA-2 deficient tumors, which method comprises administration to a patient in 'need thereof of an effective amount of a compound "of formula I or a composition comprising a compound of formula I.<br>
In an embodiment, the PARP inhibitors of the present can be used in prophylactic therapy for elimination of BRCA2-deficient cells (see, Cancer Res. (2005) 65:10145).<br>

The compounds of this invention may be administered to mammals, preferably humans, either alone or in combination with pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, excipients, diluents, adjuvants, fillers, buffers, stabilisers, preservatives, lubricants, in a pharmaceutical composition, according to standard pharmaceutical practice.<br>
The- compounds of this invention may be administered to - a subject by any convenient route of administration, whether systemically/peripherally or at the site of desired action, including but not limited to, oral (e.g. by ingestion); topical (including e.g. transdermal, intranasal, ocular, buccal, and sublingual); pulmonary (e.g. by inhalation or insufflation therapy using, e.g. an aerosol, e.g. through mouth or nose); rectal; vaginal; parenteral, (e.g. by injection, including subcutaneous, intradermal, intramuscular, intravenous, intraarterial, intracardiac, intrathecal, intraspinal, intracapsular, subcapsular, intraorbital, intraperitoneal, intratracheal, subcuticular, intraarticular, subarachnoid, and intrastemal); and by implant of a depot (e.g. subcutaneously or intramuscularly).<br>
The subject may be a eukaryote, an animal, a vertebrate animal, a mammal, a rodent (e.g. a guinea pig, a hamster, a rat, a mouse), murine (e.g. a mouse), canine (e.g. a dog), feline (e.g. a cat), equine (e.g. a horse), a primate, simian (e.g. a monkey or ape), a monkey (e.g. marmoset, baboon), an ape (e.g. gorilla, chimpanzee, orangutang, gibbon), or a human.<br>
The invention also provides pharmaceutical compositions comprising one or more compounds of this invention and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The pharmaceutical compositions containing the active ingredient may be in a form suitable for oral use, for example, as tablets, troches, lozenges, aqueous or oily suspensions, dispersible powders or granules, emulsions, hard or soft capsules, or syrups or elixirs. Compositions intended for oral use may be prepared according to any method known to the art for the manufacture of pharmaceutical compositions and such compositions may contain one or more agents selected from the group consisting of sweetening agents, flavoring agents, coloring agents and preserving agents in order to provide pharmaceutically elegant and palatable preparations. Tablets contain the active ingredient in admixture with non-toxic pharmaceutically acceptable excipients which are suitable for the manufacture of tablets. These excipients may be for example, inert diluents, such as calcium carbonate, sodium carbonate, lactose, calcium phosphate or sodium phosphate; granulating and disintegrating agents, for example, microcrystalline cellulose, sodium crosscarmellose, com starch, or alginic acid; binding agents, for example starch, gelatin, polyvinyl-pyrrolidone or acacia, and lubricating agents, for example, magnesium stearate, stearic acid or talc. The tablets may be uncoated or they may be coated by known techniques to mask the unpleasant taste of the drug or delay disintegration and absorption in the gastrointestinal tract and thereby provide a sustained action over a longer period.<br>
For example, a water soluble taste masking material such as hydroxypropyl-methylcellulose or hydroxypropylcellulose, or a time delay material such as ethyl cellulose, cellulose acetate butyrate may be employed.<br>
Formulations for oral use may also be presented as hard gelatin capsules wherein the active ingredient is mixed with an inert solid diluent, for example, calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate or kaolin, or as soft gelatin capsules wherein the active ingredient is mixed with water soluble carrier such as polyethyleneglycol or an oil medium, for example peanut oil, liquid paraffin, or olive oil.<br>
Aqueous suspensions contain the active material in admixture with excipients suitable for the manufacture of aqueous suspensions. Such excipients are suspending agents, for example sodium carboxymethylcellulose, methylcellulose, hydroxypropylmethyl-cellulose, sodium alginate, polyvinyl-pyrrolidone, gum tragacanth and gum acacia; dispersing or wetting agents may be a naturally-occurring phosphatide, for example lecithin, or condensation products of an alkylene oxide with fatty acids, for example polyoxyethylene stearate, or condensation products of ethylene oxide with long chain aliphatic alcohols, for example heptadecaethyleneoxycetanol, or condensation products of ethylene oxide with partial esters derived from fatty acids and a hexitol such as polyoxyethylene sorbitol monooleate, or condensation products of ethylene oxide with partial esters derived from fatty acids and hexitol anhydrides, for example polyethylene sorbitan monooleate. The aqueous suspensions may also contain one or more preservatives, for example ethyl, or n-propyl p-hydroxybenzoate, one or more coloring agents, one or more flavoring agents, and one or more sweetening agents, such as sucrose, saccharin or aspartame.<br>
Oily suspensions may be formulated by suspending the active ingredient in a vegetable oil, for example arachis oil, olive oil, sesame oil or coconut oil, or in mineral oil such as liquid paraffin. The oily suspensions may contain a thickening agent, for example beeswax, hard paraffin or cetyl alcohol. Sweetening agents such as those set forth above, and flavoring agents may be added to provide a palatable oral preparation. These compositions may be preserved by the addition of an anti-oxidant such as butylated hydroxyanisol or alpha-tocopherol.<br>
Dispersible powders and granules suitable for preparation of an aqueous suspension by the addition of water provide the active ingredient in admixture with a dispersing or wetting agent, suspending agent and one or more preservatives. Suitable<br>
dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents are exemplified by those already mentioned above. Additional excipients, for example sweetening, flavoring and coloring agents, may also be present. These compositions may be preserved by the addition of an anti-oxidant such as ascorbic acid.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions of the invention may also be in the form of an oil-in-watef emulsions. The oily phase may be a vegetable oil, for example olive oil or arachis oil, or a mineral oil, for example liquid paraffin or mixtures of these. Suitable emulsifying agents may be naturally occurring phosphatides, for example soy bean lecithin, and esters or partial esters derived from fatty acids and hexitol anhydrides, for example sorbitan monooleate, and condensation products of the said partial esters with ethylene oxide, for example polyoxyethylene sorbitan monooleate. The emulsions may also contain sweetening, flavoring agents, preservatives and antioxidants.<br>
Syrups and elixirs may be formulated with sweetening agents, for example glycerol, propylene glycol, sorbitol or sucrose. Such formulations may also contain a demulcent, a preservative, flavoring and coloring agents and antioxidant.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions may be in the form of a sterile injectable aqueous solution. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that may be employed are water, Ringer's solution and isotonic sodium chloride solution.<br>
The sterile injectable preparation may also be a sterile injectable oil-in-water microemulsion where the active ingredient is dissolved in the oily phase. For example, the active ingredient may be first dissolved in a mixture of soybean oil and lecithin. The oil solution then introduced into a water and glycerol mixture and processed to form a microemulation.<br>
The injectable solutions or microemulsions may be introduced into a patient's blood stream by local bolus injection. Alternatively, it may be advantageous to administer the solution or microemulsion in such a way as to maintain a constant circulating concentration of the instant compound. In order to maintain such a constant concentration, a continuous intravenous delivery device may be utilized. An example of such a device is the Deltec CADD-PLUS™ model 5400 intravenous pump.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions may be in the form of a sterile injectable aqueous or oleagenous suspension for intramuscular and subcutaneous administration. This suspension may be formulated according to the known art using those suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents which have been mentioned above.<br>
The sterile .injectable preparation may also be a sterile injectable solution or suspension in a non-toxic parenterally acceptable diluent or solvent, for example as a solution in 1,3-butanediol. In addition, sterile, fixed oils are conventionally employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose any bland fixed oil may be employed including synthetic mono- or diglycerides. In addition, fatty acids such as oleic acid find use in the preparation of injectables.<br>
Compounds of Formula I may also be administered in the form of suppositories for rectal administration of the drug. These compositions can be prepared by mixing the drug with a suitable non-irritating excipient which is solid at ordinary temperatures but liquid at the rectal temperature and will therefore melt in the rectum to release the drug. Such materials include cocoa butter, glycerinated gelatin, hydrogenated vegetable oils, mixtures of polyethylene glycols of various molecular weights and fatty acid esters of polyethylene glycol.<br>
For topical use, creams, ointments, jellies, solutions or suspensions, etc., containing the compound of Formula I are employed. (For purposes of this application, topical application shall include mouth washes and gargles.)<br>
The compounds for the present invention can be administered in intranasal form via topical use of suitable intranasal vehicles and delivery devices, or via transdermal routes, using those forms of transdermal skin patches well known to those of ordinary skill in the art. To be administered in the form of a transdermal delivery system, the dosage administration will, of course, be continuous rather than intermittent throughout the dosage regimen. Compounds of the present invention may also be delivered as a suppository employing bases such as cocoa butter, glycerinated gelatin, hydrogenated vegetable oils, mixtures of polyethylene glycols of various molecular weights and fatty acid esters of polyethylene glycol.<br>
When a compound according to this invention is administered into a subject, the selected dosage level will depend on a variety of factors including, but not limited to, the activity of the particular compound, the severity of the individuals symptoms, the route of administration, the time of administration, the rate of excretion of the compound, the duration of the treatment, other drugs, compounds, and/or materials used in combination, and the age, sex, weight, condition, general health, and prior medical history of the patient. The amount of compound and route of administration will ultimately be at the discretion of the physician, although generally the dosage will be to achieve local<br>
concentrations at the site of- action which achieve the desired effect without causing substantial harmful or deleterious side-effects.<br>
Administration in vivo can be effected in one dose, continuously or intermittently (e.g. in divided doses at appropriate intervals) throughout the course of treatment. Methods of determining the most effective means and dosage of administration are well known to those of skill in the art and will vary with the formulation used for therapy, the purpose of the therapy, the target cell being treated, and the subject being treated. Single or multiple administrations can be carried out with the dose level and pattern being selected by the treating physician.<br>
In general, a suitable dose of the active compound is in the range of about 100 ug to about 250 mg per kilogram body weight of the subject per day. Where the active compound is a salt, an ester, prodrug, or the like, the amount administered is calculated on the basis of the parent compound and so the actual weight to be used is increased proportionately.<br>
The instant compounds are also useful in combination with anti-cancer agents or chemotherapeutic agents.<br>
The compounds of this invention may be useful as chemo- and radiosensitizers for cancer treatment. They are useful for the treatment of mammals who have previously undergone or are presently undergoing treatment for cancer. Such previous treatments include prior chemotherapy, radiation therapy, surgery or immunotherapy, such as cancer vaccines.<br>
Thus, the present invention provides a combination of a compound of formula I and an anti-cancer agent for simultaneous, separate or sequential administration.<br>
The present invention also provides a compound of formula I for use in the manufacture of a medicament for use as an adjunct in cancer therapy or for potentiating tumor cells for treatment with ionizing radiation or chemotherapeutic agents.<br>
The present invention also provides a method of chemotherapy or radiotherapy, which method comprises administration to a patient in need thereof of an effective amount of a compound of formula I or a composition comprising a compound of formula I in combination with ionizing radiation or chemotherapeutic agents.<br>
In combination therapy, the compounds of this invention can be administered prior to (e. g., 5 minutes, 15 minutes, 30 minutes, 45 minutes, 1 hour, 2 hours, 4 hours, 6 hours, 12 hours, 24 hours, 48, hours, 72 hours, 96 hours, 1 week, 2 weeks, 3 weeks, 4 weeks, 5<br>
weeks, 6 weeks, 8 weeks, or 12 weeks before), concurrently with, or subsequent to (e. g., 5 minutes, 15 minutes, 30 minutes, 45 minutes,! hour, 2 hours, 4 hours, 6 hours, 12 hours, 24 hours, 48 hours, 72 hours, 96 hours, 1 week, 2 weeks, 3 weeks, 4 weeks, 5 weeks, 6 weeks, 8 weeks, or 12 weeks after) the administration of the other anticancer agent to a subject in need thereof. In various embodiments the instant compounds and another anticancer'agent are administered 1 minute apart, 10 minutes apart, 30 minutes apart, less than 1 hour apart, 1 hour to 2 hours apart, 2 hours to 3 hours apart, 3 hours to 4 hours apart, 4 hours to 5 hours apart, 5 hours to 6 hours apart, 6 hours to 7 hours apart, 7 hours to 8 hours apart, 8 hours to 9 hours apart, 9 hours to 10 hours apart, 10 hours to 11 hours apart, 11 hours to 12 hours apart, no more than 24 hours apart, or no more than 48 hours apart.<br>
The compounds of this invention and the other anticancer agent can act additively or synergistically. A synergistic combination of the present compounds and another anticancer agent might allow the use of lower dosages of one or both of these agents and/or less frequent dosages of one or both of the instant compounds and other anticancer agents and/or to administer the agents less frequently can reduce any toxicity associated with the administration of the agents to a subject without reducing the efficacy of the agents in the treatment of cancer. In addition, a synergistic effect might result in the improved efficacy of these agents in the treatment of cancer and/or the reduction of any adverse or unwanted side effects associated with the use of either agent alone.<br>

During any of the synthetic sequences described herein it may be necessary and/or desirable to protect sensitive or reactive groups on any of the molecules concerned. This may be achieved by means of conventional protecting groups, such as those described in Protecting Groups in Organic Synthesis, 3rd Edition, Greene, T. W. and Wuts, P. G. M.; Wiley Interscience, 1999 and Kocienski, P. J. Protecting Groups, Thieme, 1994. The protecting groups may be removed at a convenient subsequent stage using methods known from the art. For example, when the Boc protecting group is present, it may be removed by the addition of TFA in solvents such as DCM and/or MeCN at about room temperature. EtOAc in the presence of HC1 and 1,4-dioxane may alternatively be used, at about room temperature. The benzylcarbonyl protecting group can be removed by hydrogenation using standard methods, such as treating with a catalyst such as Pd/C, in a solvent such as methanol under a hydrogen atmosphere.<br>
The compounds of this invention were prepared according to the following schemes. All variables within the formulae are as defined above.<br>
Scheme 1<br>
Compounds described in this invention can be prepared using the methods described below. For instance, 3,6-dichloro-4-alkylpyridazine and 3,6-dichloro-4,5-<br>
dialkylpyridazines can be obtained by followed by radical addition to the dichloropyridazine, the appropriate radicals are generated by decarboxylation of the appropriate alkanoic acid with ammonium peroxodisulfate in presence of Ag(I), as described in Org. Prep. + Proc. Int. 1988, 20, 117. The reaction of the substituted 3,6-dichloropyridazine derivatives with a (hetero)aromatic group bearing an activated methylene group, activated by an electron withdrawing group such as an ester or nitrile, in the presence of base allows displacement of the chlorine groups to give a mixture of the two regioisomeric 3-((hetero)arylmethyl)pyridazines. Hydrolysis of this isomeric mixture, with concurrent decarboxylation and hydrolysis of the imino chloride group, results in the formation of the desired scaffold. At this stage the mixture of isomers may be separated (Scheme 1).<br>
(Scheme Removed) <br>
wherein:<br>
E is an electron withdrawing group e.g. -CO2Alkyl, -CN;<br>
R* is (CH2)c(CO)d(NR3)e(Z=0)f(0)g(CH2)h(NR4)1R5;<br>
R1 is C1-6alkyl; and<br>
all variables are as defined above<br>
Scheme 2<br>
Under certain circumstances the (hetero)aromatic group can bear a functional handle that can be further manipulated to yield other derivatives. For instance, a (hetero)aromatic nitrile can be carried through the synthetic sequence. This functional group can be hydrolysed during the decarboxylation reaction to yield the corresponding<br>
carboxylic acid. In turn, this can be coupled with various amines to yield the desired PARP inhibitors (Scheme 2).<br>
(Scheme Removed) <br>
wherein: E is an electron withdrawing group e.g. -CO2Alkyl, -CN;<br>
R** = (NR3)e(Z=0)f{0)g(CH2)h(NR4)lR5; and all variable are as defined above<br>
Scheme 2<br>
The inhibitors of the present invention can be transformed into other related derivatives by standard transformations known to those skilled in the art. For instance: coupling reactions of amino groups with: carboxylic acids using coupling reagents like HBTU, HATU, TBTU and PyBoP, or with activated acyl groups; sulfonylations reactions using sulfonyl chlorides; or reductive animations using a carbonyl derivative and an amino group, using a reducing agent like sodium cyanoborohydride.<br>
Scheme 3<br>
3,6-dichloro-4-alkylpyridazine can be prepared by addition of the alkyl radical to the dichloropyridazine, as described previously. Asymmetric 3,6-dichloro-4-alkyl-5-alkyl*-pyridazines, can then be formed by reacting with a second alkyl radical by decarboxylation of the appropriate alkanoic acid with ammonium peroxodisulfate in presence of Ag(I), as described in Org. Prep. + Proc. Int. 1988, 20. 117. The reaction sequences as described above allow the elaboration of the desired PARP inhibitors (Scheme 3).<br>
(Scheme Removed) <br>
wherein:<br>
E is an electron withdrawing group e.g. -CO2Alkyl, -CN; R* is (CH2)c(CO)d(NR3)e(Z=0)f(0)g(CH2)h(NR4)1R5; R1 and R1' are C1-6alkyl; and all variables are as defined above<br>
Scheme 3<br>
Scheme 4<br>
An alternative method to convert these PARP inhibitors into related compounds is using a Curtius reaction. A compound containing a carboxylic acid can be treated with<br>
diphenylphosphoryl azide in an. alcoholic solvent at reflux and undergo a Curtius rearrangement reaction to the corresponding carbamate. This carbamate can then be hydrolyzed under acidic conditions to the corresponding (hetero)aniline derivative which thereafter can be elaborated into the desired PARP inhibitors by coupling reaction under standard conditions (Scheme 8). In a related manner, the (hetero)aniline derivative can be coupled with either a acyl anhydride and then further cyclised to the corresponding imide by addition of a coupling reagent such as TBTU. Alternatively, the (hetero)anilide can be coupled with an carboxylic acid containing a carbamate moiety, subsequent microwave irradiation in the presence of DMAP allows cyclisation to the corresponding cyclic urea.<br>
(Scheme Removed) <br>
Scheme 4<br>
Scheme 5<br>
A further method to convert one type of inhibitor into another is to carry out a nucleophilic aromatic substitution reaction on the Y ring. For example, a halogen group, for instance a fluoride, on the (hetero)aromatic ring can be displaced with an alkoxide ion or an amino group. Treatment with a sodium alkoxide in a refluxing alcohol solvent allows an alkoxy group to be introduced on the Y ring. Alternatively, vigorous heating of the substrate in a solution of the amine in a polar solvent like DMF, in a sealed reaction vessel, allows the formation of alkylamino and dialkylamino groups on the Y ring. Subsequent functional group manipulations such as the hydrolysis of nitrile groups in strong basic media at reflux and coupling, gives the desired PARP inhibitors (Scheme 5).<br>
(Scheme Removed) <br>
wherein:	<br>
X = Halogen, e.g.fluorine<br>
R* is (CH2)c(CO)d(NR3)e(Z=0)f(0)g(CH2)h(NR4)iR5;<br>

all variables are as defined above<br>
