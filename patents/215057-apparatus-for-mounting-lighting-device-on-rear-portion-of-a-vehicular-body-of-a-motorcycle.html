				<td>[Detailed Description of the Invention] [0001]<br>
[Technical Field of the Invention]<br>
    The  present  invention  relates to an apparatus for PBC<br>
body of a motorcycle on a rear portion of a vehicwar<br>
[0002]<br>
[Related Art]<br>
A structure of mounting a lighting device on a rear portion of a vehicular body has been disclosed, for example, in Japanese Utility Model Laid-Open   No. Hei 2-117279 entitled "Structure of Disposing Stop Lamp for<br>
Motorcycle".<br>
The above technique is intended to provide a structure of disposing a stop lamp for a motorcycle, which is capable of improving visibility from rearward. As shown in Figs. 1, 2, 3 and 4 of the above document, the structure includes a body frame 2; two frames 2a provided on a rear portion of the body frame 2; supporting members 10 extending upward from rear ends of the frames 2a; a bracket 12 provided between the supporting members 10; a supporting plate 15 mounted on the upper portion of the bracket 12 and the frames 2a; a stop lamp 16 provided on the supporting plate 15; a supporting member 20 extending downward from rear ends of the frames 2a; a supporting plate 22 mounted on the supporting member 20; a tail lamp 26 provided on the supporting plate 22; and winker lamps 32 disposed on the right and left sides of the tail lamp 26. [0003]<br>
In the above technique, since the supporting plate<br>
15 provided with the stop lamp 16 and the supporting plate 22 provided with the tail lamp 26 are mounted on the rear portions of the frames 2a of the body frame 2, the frames 2a are longer extended rearward. This causes an inconvenience that the weight of the frames 2a is increased.<br>
Further, since a lower end of the supporting plate 15 is mounted on the rear ends of the frames 2a, there occurs an inconvenience that vibration is directly transmitted from the frames 2a to the stop lamp 16.<br>
In view of the foregoing, a first object of the present invention is to provide a structure of mounting a lighting device on a rear portion of the vehicular body, which is capable of reducing the weight of a body frame and also reducing vibration transmitted to the lighting device. On the other hand, a lighting device for a vehicle A has been disclosed, for example, in Japanese Utility Model I Laid-open No. Hei 7-14503 entitled "Tail Lamp for Automobile".<br>
The above-described technique concerns a tail lamp capable of achieving a high brightness by making use of light directly emitted from a lamp and light reflected from a reflector. As shown in Fig. 2 of the document, a tail lamp 1 provided on a rear portion of a vehicular body 2<br>
includes an outer lens 5 formed correspondingly to the surface of the vehicular body 2 for covering the tail lamp 1, and an inner lens 10 provided inside the outer lens 5 with a distance put therebetween. [0004]<br>
In recent years, for the purpose of improving an outer appearance of a vehicle, it has been examined to make lens colors of a stop lamp, a turn signal lamp and the like of a rear combination lamp identical to each other by combination of an outer lens and an inner lens.  However, the combination of inner and outer lens having different colors has a problem that there easily occurs unevenness of color of the outer lens by the effect of light emitted from the inner lens.<br>
On the other hand, a capacity of a luggage chamber has been required to be increased for improving usability of a vehicle, and to meet such a requirement, a light device has been also required to be miniaturized, for example, by making smaller the distance between the outer lens 5 and the inner lens 10 described in the above related art.<br>
In view of the foregoing, a second object of the present invention is to provide a structure of mounting a lighting device on a rear portion of the vehicular body,<br>
which is capable of preventing occurrence of unevenness of lighting for the lighting device for a vehicle and miniaturizing the lighting device. [0005]<br>
[Means for Solving the Problem]<br>
To achieve the above first object, according to an invention described in claim 1, there is provided a structure of mounting a lighting device on a rear portion of a vehicular body of a motorcycle in which a containing box is provided on a rear portion of a body frame and a seat is provided on an upper portion of the containing box, characterized in that the containing box is extended rearward and swelled downward from the body frame, and the lighting device is mounted on a rear side outer wall of the containing box.<br>
The overall length of the body frame can be reduced and thereby the weight thereof can be reduced. Also, since the lighting device is mounted to the body frame through the containing box, vibration transmitted from the body frame to the lighting device can be reduced. [0006]<br>
According to an invention described in claim 2, the rear side outer wall of the containing box has a curve surface projecting rearward, and the lighting device is<br>
mounted along the curve surface of the rear side outer wall.<br>
Since the mounting area of the rear side outer wail for mounting the lighting device is widened, the mounting strength thereof can be improved and the visibility from rearward can be enhanced. [0007]<br>
According to an invention described in claim 3, the lighting device is U-shaped in a rear view, and has a locking portion for locking a body rear surface cover is provided inside the U-shaped portion of the lighting device.<br>
The body rear surface cover can be easily mounted to the lighting device, and the appearance of the lighting device can be easily matched with that of the body rear surface cover.<br>
To achieve the above second object, according to an invention described in claim 4, there is provided a structure of mounting a lighting device on a rear portion of a vehicle in which a front surface side of a bulb is covered with an inner lens and an outer lens, characterized in that a corner portion of the inner lens, facing to a lens face of the outer lens, has a wall thickness thinner than that of a periphery of the corner portion.<br>
Light having passed through the thin wall portion of the inner lens is colored in a thin color, and light having refracted from another port-ion of the lens and having passed the corner portion is colored in a thick color. Consequently, at the corner portion of the lens, the light having the thin color is mixed with the light having the thick color, to form light colored in a color having a normal depth, thereby preventing occurrence of unevenness of lighting at the corner portion of the lens. [0008]<br>
According to an invention described in claim 5, a corner portion of an end portion in a region of the inner lens corresponding to the lens face of the outer lens has a recessed or projecting curve surface.<br>
Light advancing in the inner lens is diffused from the recessed or projecting curve surface at the folded end portion of the inner lens, so that light at the end portion of the inner lens is not colored in a thick color, to thereby prevent occurrence of unevenness of lighting at the end portion of the lens. [0009]<br>
According to an invention described in claim 6, the inner lens is formed into a shape being substantially the same as that of the outer lens and is provided in proximity<br>
to the outer lens.<br>
When a clearance between the outer lens and the inner lens is reduced, the potential of diffusion of the light having passed through the inner lens is reduced, and thereby the light tends to be collected in the outer lens, as a result of which there occurs unevenness of lighting.<br>
On the other hand, when the clearance between the outer lens and the inner lens is larger than the usual one, with respect to bright potions created by light passing substantially straightly through the inner lens and the outer lens, there occurs an areal difference between the bright portion of the inner lens and the bright portion of the outer lens. Such an areal difference between bright portions leads to doubled lighting which is viewed as unevenness of lighting. For this reason, the clearance has been generally selected such that unevenness of lighting is intermediate between the above-described two patterns.<br>
The present invention, however, has the configuration described in claim 4 or 5, so that the potential of occurrence of unevenness of lighting can be reduced even if the clearance is reduced. As a result, it is possible to miniaturize the lighting device while preventing occurrence of unevenness of lighting by providing the inner lens in proximity to the outer lens.<br>
Accordingly the present invention relates to an apparatus yfrf mounting a lighting device 70 on a rear portion of a vehicular body of a motorcycle in which a containing box 50 is provided on a rear portion of a body frame 2 and a seat 16 is provided on an upper portion of said containing box 50, characterized in that<br>
said containing box 50 is extended rearward and swelled downward from the body frame.2, and said lighting device is<br>
mounted on a rear side outer wall 54a of said containing<br>
box, said lighting device 70 be-amg U-shaped in a rear view<br>
and having a locking portion 70a for locking a body rear surface cover 30 provided inside the U-shaped portion of said lighting devi'ce 70.<br>

The locking portion 70a for locking the rear upper cover 30 (see Fig. 3) has a plurality of raised walls 70b and a plurality of claw portions 70c.  The rear portion of the rear upper cover 30 is inserted between the raised walls 70b and the claw portions 70c.<br>
Each of the rear turn signal lamps 71 and 72 of the rear combination lamp 70 is extended from the rear portion to the side portion and also it is disposed on the rear upper portion of the vehicular body, and thereby it is improved in visibility from rearward and sideward. [0024]<br>
Fig. 8 is a sectional view taken on line 8-8 of Fig. 4, showing a state in which a raised portion 30a formed on the rear upper cover 30 is inserted between the raised wall 7Ob and the claw portion 70c which are formed<br>
on the locking portion 70a of the rear combination lamp 70.<br>
with this configuration in which the raised portion 30a is inserted in the locking portion 70, the lower portion of the rear upper cover 30 can be easily fixed on the rear combination lamp 70. [0025]<br>
Fig. 9 is an enlarged side view of the supporting portion of the containing box according to the present invention.  The supporting portion 66 of the containing box 50 has at an upper end thereof an insertion groove 66a, and a front wall 85a of the portion 85 to be supported of the rear combination lamp 70 is inserted in the insertion groove 66a.<br>
With this configuration in which the front wall 85a is inserted in the insertion groove 66a, when the rear combination lamp 70 is mounted on the containing box 50, they can be positioned by fitting the front wall 85a in the insertion groove 66a, so that holes at mounting positions other than those shown in Fig. 5 can be positioned to each other and they can be easily fixed to each other with screws. [0026]<br>
Fig. 10 is a sectional view taken on line 10-10 of Fig. 4. The rear turn signal lamp 71 includes a base 71c<br>
molded integrally with a reflector 71b, a socket 71d mounted to the base 71c, a bulb 7la mounted to the socket 71d, an outer lens 71e covering the outer side of the lamp 71, and an inner lens 71f disposed inside the outer lens 71e with a slight distance put therebetween.  In addition, reference numerals 71g and 71h indicate seal members.<br>
The maximum distance (clearance) between the outer lens 71e and the inner lens 71f is expressed by a relationship of 0 
To obtain a monolithic feeling of the rear combination lamp 70 (see Fig. 7), the outer lens 71e has the surface level smoothly joined to the surface level of the lens 73b of the tail lamp 73 (see Fig. 7) and also it is colored into the same red based color as that of the lens 73b. [0028]<br>
The inner lens 71f is colored into a green based color. When the lamp 71 lights up, the color of the light passing through the inner lens 71f and the outer lens 71e becomes the orange color (specified by JIS D 5500).<br>
The rear turn signal lamp 72 (see Fig. 7) has the same configuration as that of the rear turn signal lamp 71,<br>
except that they are disposed opposite to each other in the width direction, and therefore, the explanation thereof is omitted. [0029]<br>
In the rear combination lamp 70, as described above, the outer lens of each of the rear turn signal lamps 71 and 72 is colored into the same red based color as that of the lens 73b and the inner lens of each of the rear turn signal lamps 71 and 72 is colored into the green based color, and accordingly, the rear combination lamp 70 in a state not lighting up is entirely colored in the red based color, and thereby it may be viewed as if it has the monolithic appearance. The outer appearance of the rear combination lamp 70 is thus improved. [0030]<br>
The inner lens 71f has a thin wall portion 71k at a corner portion 71j which is a bent portion in a range contributing to lighting.<br>
The thin wall portion 71k is formed by cutting off an outer surface side of the corner portion 71j of the inner lens 71f.<br>
Further, the inner lens 71f has a recessed curve surface 71n at an end portion 71m in a range contributing to lighting.<br>
[0031]<br>
The function of the inner lens 71f having the above configuration will be described below.<br>
Fig. 11 is an enlarged sectional view of an essential portion, showing the function of the corner portion of the inner lens according to the present invention.<br>
Light R, which is emitted from the bulb 7la (see Fig. 10) of the rear turn signal lamp 71 (see Fig. 10) and reaches the corner portion 71j of the inner lens 71f, passes through the thin wall portion 71k, an air layer A, and the outer lens 71e.  The light having passed through the outer lens 71e is taken as Rl.<br>
In this case, since the green color of the light R having passed through the thin wall portion 71k becomes thinner than the green color of light having passed through a normal wall thickness portion near the thin wall portion 71k, the orange color of the light Rl having passed through the outer lens 71e becomes thinner than the normal orange color. [0032]<br>
On the other hand, light R, which is emitted from the bulb 7la of the rear turn signal lamp 71 and reaches an upper surface portion 71p of the inner lens 71f, advances<br>
in the inner lens 71f while being repeatedly reflected and passes through the thin wall portion 71k at the corner portion 71j, and then it passes through the air layer A and the outer lens 71e. The light having passed through the outer lens 71e is taken as R2. [0033]<br>
In this case, since the light R passes through the inner lens 71f while being repeatedly reflected, the light path in the inner lens 71f for the light R becomes longer, so that the green color of the light R becomes gradually thicker.  Consequently, the orange color of the light R2 having passed through the outer lens 71e becomes thicker than the normal orange color.<br>
The light Rl having the thin orange color is mixed with the light R2 having the thick color, and consequently, the light at the corner portion of each of the rear turn signal lamps 71 and 72 is colored in the normal orange color.  In other words, there is no difference in the depth of the light color between the corner portion and the periphery thereof. As a result, it is possible to eliminate occurrence of unevenness of lighting. [0034]<br>
Figs. 12(a) and 12(b) are enlarged sectional views of an essential portion, showing the function of the end<br>
portion of the inner lens according to the present invention, wherein Fig. 12(a) shows the end portion formed in the shape shown in Fig. 10 according to this embodiment, and Fig. 12(b) shows the end portion formed in a shape different from that shown in Fig. 10 according to a modification of this embodiment.<br>
Referring to Fig. 12(a), light R (outermost one in the figure), which is emitted from the bulb 71a (see Fig. 10) of the rear turn signal lamp 71 (see Fig. 10) and reaches the inner lens 71f, is reflected in the inner lens 71f, reaching the curve surface 7In, and is reflected again from the curve surface 71n, after which the light R passes through the inner lens 71f, the air layer A, and the outer lens 71e.  The light having passed through the outer lens 71e is taken as R3. [0035]<br>
Similarly, each of light R (intermediate one) and light R (lowermost one) is reflected in the inner lens 71f, reaching the curve surface 71n, and is reflected again from the curve surface 71n, after which the light R passes through the inner lens 71f, the air layer A, and the outer lens 71e.  The light (intermediate one) and the light (lowermost one) having passed through the outer lens 71e are taken as R4 and R5, respectively.<br>
[0036]<br>
The light R3, light R4, and light R5 advance in the different directions.<br>
Accordingly, a collection of light at the end portion 71m can be diffused by provision of the curve surface 7In, as a result of which it is possible to eliminate occurrence of unevenness of lighting at the lens end portion of each of the rear turn signal lamps 71 and 72 (see Fig. 7). [0037]<br>
Referring to Fig. 12(b), the inner lens 71f has a projecting curve surface 71q at the end portion 71m in a range contributing to lighting.<br>
Light R (outermost one in the figure), which is emitted from the bulb 7la (see Fig. 10) of the rear turn signal lamp 71 (see Fig. 10) and reaches the inner lens 71f, is reflected in the inner lens 71f, reaching the curve surface 71q, and is reflected again from the curve surface 71q, after which the light R passes through the inner lens 71f, the air layer A, and the outer lens 71e.  The light having passed through the outer lens 71e is taken as R6. [0038]<br>
Similarly, each of light R (intermediate one) and light R (lowermost one) is reflected in the inner lens 71f,<br>
reaching the curve surface 71q, and is reflected again from the curve surface 71q, after which the light R passes through the inner lens 71f, the air layer A, and the outer lens 71e. The light (intermediate one) and the light (lowermost one) having passed through the outer lens 71e are taken as R7 and R8, respectively. [0039]<br>
The light R6, light R7, and light R8 advance in the different directions.<br>
Accordingly, a collection of light at the end portion 71m can be diffused by provision of the curve surface 71q, as a result of which it is possible to eliminate occurrence of unevenness of lighting at the lens end portion of each of the rear turn signal lamps 71 and 72 (see Fig. 7). [0040]<br>
Further, as described above, each of the rear turn signal lamps 71 and 72 includes the thin wall portion 71k at the corner portion 71j as shown in Fig. 11 and also the curve surface 7In or 71q at the end portion 71m as shown in Fig. 12(a) or 12(b), and accordingly, it is possible to reduce the potential of occurrence of unevenness of lighting even if the maximum distance L between the outer lens 71e and the inner lens 71f is reduced in Fig. 10. As<br>
a result, by disposing the inner lens 71f in proximity to the outer lens 71e, it is possible to miniaturize each of the rear turn signal lamps 71 and 72 while preventing occurrence of unevenness of lighting. [0041]<br>
Fig. 13 is a sectional view showing a comparative example of an inner lens of a rear turn signal lamp. A rear turn signal lamp 100 includes a socket 102 molded integrally with a reflector 101; a bulb 103 mounted to the socket 102; lens mounting portions 104 and 105 mounted on an outer side of the reflector 101; an outer lens 106 colored in a red based color, which is mounted to the lens mounting portions 104 and 105; and an inner lens 107 colored in a green based color, which is disposed inside the outer lens 106 with a slight distance put therebetween.<br>
The inner lens 107 has a corner portion 108 and an end portion 109. [0042]<br>
The function of the inner lens 107 having the above configuration will be described below.<br>
Fig. 14(a) and 14(b) are enlarged sectional views of essential portions in Fig. 13, wherein Fig. 14(a) shows a C portion of Fig. 13 on a large scale, and Fig. 14(b) shows a D portion of Fig. 13 on a large scale.<br>
Referring to Fig. 14(a), light R, which is emitted from the bulb 103 (see Fig. 13) of the rear turn signal lamp 100 (see Fig. 13), passes through a coiner portion 108 of the inner lens 107, an air layer A, and the outer lens 106.  The light having passed through the outer lens 106 is taken as R 101. [0043]<br>
Light R, which is emitted from the bulb 103 of the rear turn signal lamp 100 and reaches an upper surface portion 111 of the inner lens 107, advances while being repeatedly reflected, and passes through the inner lens 107 at the corner portion 108, after which the light R passes through the air layer A and the outer lens 106.  The light having passed through the outer lens 106 is taken as R102. [0044]<br>
In this case, since the light R passes through the inner lens 107 while being repeatedly reflected, the light path in the inner lens 107 for the light R becomes longer, so that the green color of the light R becomes gradually thicker.  Consequently, the orange color of the light R102 having passed through the outer lens 106 becomes thicker than the normal orange color.<br>
Accordingly, since the light R101 is mixed with the light 103, the light at the corner portion 108 of the rear<br>
turn signal lamp 100 is colored in an orange color being thicker in green color than the normal orange color, and such light causes unevenness of lighting with respect to normal light at the periphery of the corner portion 108. [0045]<br>
Referring to Fig. 14(b), light R (outermost one in the figure), which is emitted from the bulb 103 (see Fig. 13) of the rear turn signal lamp 100 (see Fig. 13) and reaches the inner lens 107, is reflected in the inner lens 107, reaching a flat portion 112, and is reflected again from the flat portion 112, after which the light R passes through the inner lens 107, the air layer A, and the outer lens 106.  The light having passed through the outer lens 106 is taken as R103. [0046]<br>
Similarly, each of light R (intermediate one) and light R (lowermost one) is reflected in the inner lens 107, reaching the flat portion 112, and is reflected again from the flat portion 112, after which the light R passes through the inner lens 107, the air layer A, and the outer lens 106.  The light (intermediate one) and the light (lowermost one) having passed through the outer lens 106 are taken as R104 and R105, respectively. [0047]<br>
The light R103, light R104, and light R105 advance in the same directions.<br>
Accordingly, a collection of light at the end portion 109 is reflected in the same direction by provision of the flat portion 112, as a result of which light at the end portion 109 of the rear turn signal lamp 100 is colored in an orange color being thicker in green color than the normal orange, and such light causes unevenness of lighting with respect to normal light at the periphery of the end portion 109. [0048]<br>
When the maximum distance L between the outer lens 106 and the inner lens 107 shown in Fig. 13 is reduced, the potential of diffusion of the light having passed through the inner lens 107 is reduced, and thereby the light tends to be collected in the outer lens 106, as a result of which there occurs unevenness of lighting.<br>
When the maximum distance L between the outer lens 106 and the inner lens 107 is larger than the usual one, with respect to bright potions created by light passing substantially straightly through the inner lens 107 and the outer lens 106 from the bulb 103, there occurs an areal difference between the bright portion of the inner lens 107 and the bright portion of the outer lens 106.  Such an<br>
areal difference between bright portions leads to doubled lighting which is viewed as unevenness of lighting.  For this reason, the maximum distance L has been generally selected such that unevenness of lighting is intermediate between the above-described two patterns.<br>
As described above, the embodiment for the rear combination lamp 70, shown in Fig. 10, is carried out for preventing unevenness of lighting at the corner portion and the end portion of the lens shown in Fig. 13. [0049]<br>
While the thin wall portion 71j is formed by cutting off the outer surface side as shown in Fig. 11 according to the embodiment of the present invention, it may be formed by cutting off the inner surface side in a round shape. [0050]<br>
[Effect of the Invention]<br>
The present invention having the above configuration exhibits the following effects.<br>
In the structure of mounting a lighting device on a rear portion of a vehicular body described in claim 1, the containing box is extended rearward and swelled downward from the body frame, and the lighting device is mounted on a rear side outer wall of the containing box.  As a result,<br>
the overall length of the body frame can be reduced and thereby the weight thereof can be reduced. Also, since the lighting device is mounted to the body frame through the containing box, vibration transmitted from the body frame to the lighting device can be reduced. [0051]<br>
In the structure of mounting a lighting device on a rear portion of a vehicular body described in claim 2, the rear side outer wall of the containing box has a curve surface projecting rearward, and the lighting device is mounted along the curve surface of the rear side outer wall. With this configuration, since the mounting area of the rear side outer wall for mounting the lighting device is widened, the mounting strength thereof can be improved and the visibility from rearward can be enhanced. [0052]<br>
In the structure of mounting a lighting device on a rear portion of a vehicular body described in claim 3, the lighting device is U-shaped in a rear view, and has a locking portion for locking a body rear surface cover is provided inside the U-shaped portion of the lighting device. As a result, the body rear surface cover can be easily mounted to the lighting device, and the appearance of the lighting device can be easily matched with that of<br>
the body rear surface cover.<br>
According to the structure of mounting a lighting device on a rear portion of a vehicle described in claim 4, a corner portion of the inner lens, facing to a lens face of the outer lens, has a wall thickness thinner than that of a periphery of the corner portion.  Accordingly, light having passed through the thin wall portion of the inner lens is colored in a thin color, and light having refracted from another portion of the lens and having passed the corner portion is colored in a thick color.  Consequently, at the corner portion, the light having the thin color is mixed with the light having the thick color, to form light colored in a color having a normal depth, thereby preventing occurrence of unevenness of lighting at the corner portion of the lens. [0053]<br>
In the structure of mounting a lighting device described in claim 5, a corner portion of an end portion in a region of the inner lens corresponding to the lens face of the outer lens has a recessed or projecting curve surface.  As a result, light advancing in the inner lens is diffused from the recessed or projecting curve surface at the folded end portion of the inner lens, so that light at the end portion of the inner lens is not colored in a thick<br>
color, to thereby prevent occurrence of unevenness of<br>
lighting at the end portion of the lens.<br>
[0054]<br>
In the structure of mounting a lighting device described in claim 6, the inner lens is formed into a shape being substantially the same as that of the outer lens and is provided in proximity to the outer lens.  As a result, since the structure has the thin corner portion and the curve surface at the folded end portion, the potential of occurrence of unevenness of lighting can be reduced even if the clearance is reduced.  Consequently, it is possible to miniaturize the lighting device while preventing occurrence of unevenness of lighting.<br>
