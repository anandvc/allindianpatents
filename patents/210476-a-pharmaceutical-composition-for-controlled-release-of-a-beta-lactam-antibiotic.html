The following specification particularly describes the nature of this invention and the manner in which it is to be performed<br><br><br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to an improved stabilized pharmaceutical composition of modified release tablets comprising a betalactam antibiotic or their pharmaceutically acceptable hydrates, salts or esters as the active ingredient, which would provide for controlled release of said actives \ and will also be capable of maintaining its dissolution characteristics upon storage, at ambient and accelerated conditions. The stabilized composition of the invention is also adapted to withstand the peristaltic pressure in the stomach and intestine, maintain the integrity of the composition and thereby avoid problems of dose dumping. Advantageously, the composition of the invention can be selectively provided to favour desired release of the therapeutically effective active ingredient such as at a rate suitable for once or twice daily administration of the pharmaceutical composition. The composition optionally contains probenecid as an antibiotic adjuvant.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
United States Patent No. US 6,267,986 Bl teaches preparation of a controlled release pseudoephdrine composition in combination with an antihistamine comprising two discrete zones. The first discrete zone comprises pseudoephdrine, one or more hydrophilic polymers, a salt of a polyuronic acid and a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of a group II metal ion and the second discrete zone comprises an antihistamine.<br>
United States Patent No. US 5,419,917 discloses a controlled release hydrogel formulation for substantially zero-order release rate of drug from the hydrogel which is based on the use of an effective amount of a pharmaceutically acceptable ionizable compound. The hydrogel forming agent are being selected from the group consisting of hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, sodium alginate and xanthan and the ionizable compound being selected from the group consisting of alkali metal chlorides, organic acids, alkali metal sulfates and alkali metal alkyl sulfates, dihydrogen sodium phosphate and monohydrogen sodium phosphate.<br>
A sustained release cephalexin tablet containing xanthan gum and sodium alginate as matrix formers was evaluated in human volunteers using in-vitrolin-vivo correlations. The optimized<br>
2<br><br>
formulation containing 5 % xanthan gum and 8 % sodium alginate, decided on the basis of response surface analysis and computer simulation of cephalexin plasma levels versus time curves was used for clinical trials and was found to prolong the cephalexin blood levels up to 8 hours in humans. However, the relative bioavailability of cephalexin was reduced by about 30 % and very little absorption was seen after six to eight hours, rendering the formulation not very useful for once daily regimen (see Dhopeshwarkar V;, O"Keeffe J. C, Zatz J. L., Deeter R. and Horton M., Drug Develp. Ind. Phar., 20, 1851, 1994).<br>
Our PCT Application No. PCT/TN00/00112 relates to a pharmaceutical composition of modified release tablets comprising a betalactam antibiotic or their pharmaceutically acceptable hydrates, salts or esters as the active ingredient, and a mixture of hydrophilic polymers selected from the group consisting of at least one sodium alginate and at least one xanthan gum as controlled release matrix, and optionally probenecid. Inclusion of probenecid allows reduction in the amount of active incorporated in the polymeric matrix but can still provide desired once daily profile. The resulting modified release matrix formulation not containing probenecid may be administered in a once or twice daily regimen and the resulting modified release matrix formulation containing probenecid may be administered in a once daily regimen. However, it was observed that tablets become soft and irregular after about 6 hours ofin-vitro dissolution studies, the integrity of the tablet and its shape is not maintained at a later stage after hydration. This soft irregular mass of the composition may not withstand the peristaltic pressure in the stomach and intestine, which could possibly lead to dose dumping in later stage.<br>
Further, it was observed that the release of the active ingredient was faster from the samples stored for stability study under ambient and accelerated conditions, when compared to initial stage in-vitro dissolution data, which may render the composition ideally not suited for use as a controlled release composition haying desired release profile.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
The basic object of the present invention is to provide an improved stable composition of a betalactam antibiotic such as cephalexin, cefaclor or their pharmaceutically acceptable hydrates, salts or esters in a modified release matrix formulation, which would avoid the<br>
3<br><br>
above discussed problems associated with stability of the composition and integrity of the composition and consequential dose dumping.<br>
A further object of the present invention is to provide an improved stable composition of a betalactam antibiotic such as cephalexin, cefaclor or their pharmaceutically acceptable hydrates, salts or esters in a modified release matrix formulation, optionally containing probenecid such that the composition maintains its dissolution characteristics upon storage, at ambient and accelerated conditions.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide an improved stable composition of a betalactam antibiotic such as cephalexin, cefaclor or their pharmaceutically acceptable hydrates, salts or esters in a modified release matrix formulation, optionally containing probenecid such that the integrity and shape of the composition is maintained even at the later stage of hydration.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Thus according to one aspect of the present invention there is provided a stable improved pharmaceutical composition for controlled release of an active ingredient comprising a controlled release matrix comprising i)a betalactam antibiotic or their pharmaceutically acceptable hydrates, salts or esters as the active ingredient in amounts of 30 % to 90 % by weight, ii)a mix of hydrophilic polymers in amount of 1 % to 25 % selected from the group consisting of at least one sodium alginate in amounts of 0.1 % to 20 %, and at least one xanthan gum in amounts of 0.1 % to 20 % and Hi) a calcium salt in an amount of 8 % to 20 % by weight of sodium alginate.<br>
In accordance with a preferred aspect the composition of the invention, in particular the hydrophilic polymers used therein incorporate along witn the said sodium alginate and said xanthan gum optionally at least one hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, preferably in amount of 0.1 % to 20 % by weight of the controlled release matrix.<br>
It is found that the above selective controlled release formulation of the invention avoids the shortcoming of integrity of the matrix composition comprising at least one sodium alginate and at least one xanthan gum and also takes care of the desired controlled release profile of<br>
4<br><br>
the active. By inclusion of a hydroxypropyl methyicellulose in to the matrix, the integrity of the tablet is improved and its shape is maintained at a later stage after hydration so that it withstands the peristaltic pressure in the stomach and intestine thereby obviating the possibility of dose dumping.<br>
Advantageously, the selective use of a calcium salt such as calcium sulphate in the defined range as disclosed above is also found to be advantageous in use with sodium alginate as a polymer niatrix material for controlled release formulation. This is because calcium alginate when used as such in sustained release preparation forms a water insoluble gel, which has reduced diffusivity and erosion of gel layer. But addition of the selective calcium salt in dry state in the polymer matrix containing sodium alginate acts as a matrix stabilizing agent by in situ formation of a localized calcium alginate gel, as after ingestion of the composition, the solvent front passes up to the core of the composition resulting in formation of gel layer in a manner such that a gel layer contains combination of sodium and calcium alginate, which would erode faster in comparison to a gel layer containing only calcium alginate leading to desired release profile of the active from the composition.<br>
Importantly, the above composition of the invention attends to the problems of stability of the tablets after storage at ambient and accelerated conditions, by selective incorporation of a calcium salt such as calcium sulphate in a defined range as matrix stabilising agent.<br>
In accordance with a preferred aspect, the invention proposes the use of a hydroxypropyl methyicellulose into the matrix, which forms a strong gel structure. These hydrophilic polymers when used in appropriate concentrations, form the integrated matrix which provides the desired release profile, when the delivery system travels through the GIT, having varying physiological condition. Surprisingly, the polymers in appropriate combinations are not only effective compared to other commonly used polymers, but works at low concentrations. The combination of these polymers compliment each other such that, it overcomes the deficiencies associated with their use, when used alone.<br>
The composition of the invention can optionally also contain one or more water soluble and/or water dispersible diluents, wherein the quantities of the. hydrophilic polymers and water soluble and/or water dispersible diluents are such that the therapeutically effective<br>
5<br><br>
active ingredient is released at a rate suitable for once or twice daily administration of the pharmaceutical composition. Inclusion of probenecid allows reduction in the amount of active incorporated in the hydrophihc polymer matrix but still provides the desired once a day profile.<br>
The preferred betalactam antibiotic is selected from cephalexin, cefaclor or their pharmaceutical^ acceptable hydrates, salts or esters.<br>
The modified release matrix formulation not containing probenecid prepared according to present invention may be administered once or twice daily. For Example, the effective therapeutic dose of the active that can be administered by compositions of present invention include 375 mg to 500 mg active twice daily or 750 mg to 1500 mg active once daily.<br>
The modified release matrix formulation containing probenecid prepared according to present invention may be administered once daily. For example, the effective therapeutic dose of the active that can be administered by compositions of present invention include 500 mg to 1000 mg active and 500 mg to 1000 mg probenecid once daily.<br>
It is to be understood that both the foregoing general description and the following detailed description are exemplary, but are not restrictive, of the invention.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The composition of this invention is in the form of a. matrix tablet comprising the active ingredient, hydrophilic polymers, a calcium salt, water soluble and/or water dispersible diluents, pharmaceutically acceptable tablet excipients, and antibiotic adjuvant if any, for controlling the release of active ingredients.<br>
According to the present invention, the active ingredient is a betalactam antibiotic such as cephalexin, cefaclor or their pharmaceutically acceptable hydrates, salts or esters in a controlled release matrix. The cephalexin, cefaclor or their pharmaceutically acceptable hydrates, salts or esters may be present in an amount from about 30 % to about 90 % by weight of the controlled release matrix.<br>
6<br><br>
Further, the cephalexin, cefaclor or their pharmaceutically acceptable hydrates, salts or esters may be present in an amount from 100 mg to 2000 mg.<br>
Examples of other cephalosporin antibiotics which may be used include cefuroxime, cefamandole, cefoxitin, cephalothin, moxalactam, cephapirin, ceffizoxime, cefonicid and, pharmaceutically acceptable hydrates, salts or esters thereof. Examples of other betalactam antibiotics, which may be used, are amoxicillin, ampicillin, and cloxacillin.<br>
Examples of the calcium salts useful in the present invention are calcium sulphate, calcium citrate, disodium. calcium edetate, calcium lactate, calcium ascorbate, calcium gluconate, calcium chloride. The preferred calcium salt is calcium sulphate.<br>
Xanthan gum when used as a matrix forming agent in sustained release tablets, releases the drug slightly faster in acidic media, due to more rapid initial surface erosion than at higher pH. After hydration of the gum the drug release is essentially pH independent but the release of drug decrease exponentially.<br>
Alginic acid is insoluble in aqueous media. However, as the pH is raised above 3, the alginic acid is partly converted to a soluble salt. Complete neutralization occurs around pH 4, where the alginic acid is completely converted to its corresponding salt. Sodium, potassium, magnesium and ammonium salts are examples of water-soluble alginate salts. Neutralization by calcium, barium and other multivalent alkali materials will produce insoluble alginate salts.<br>
Thus when sodium alignate is used along with xanthan gum to form a controlled release matrix, it reduces the initial bursting effi ;t and in later stages acts as a channeling agent to increase the release rate of the active.<br>
It is known in the art that in gastric fluid the hydrated sodium alginate is converted into a porous, insoluble alginic acid skin. Once passed into the higher pH of the intestinal tract, the alginic acid skin is converted to a soluble viscous layer.<br>

In one more preferred embodiment of the present invention, the pharmaceutical composition comprises from about 30 % to about 90 % by weight of cephalexin, cefaclor or their<br>

to about 1000 cPs); xanthan gum may be characterized as low viscosity (about 600 to about 1500 cPs), medium viscosity (about 1550 to about 1850 cPs) and high viscosity (greater than about 1900 cPs); and hydroxypropyl methylcellulose may be characterized by their viscosity in a 2 % w/w aqueous solution as low viscosity (less than 1000 cps), medium viscocity (about 1000 cps to about 10,000 cps) and high viscosity (greater then about 10,000 cps).<br>
The different viscosity grade polymers may be used in the present invention, but in order to utilize minimum possible concentrations of the polymer to achieve the desired profiles, without compromising on the integrity of the matrix, medium or high viscosity grade polymers are preferred.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the pharmaceutical composition comprises from about 30 % to about 90 % by weight of cephalexin, cefaclor or their pharmaceutically acceptable hydrates, salts or esters and about 1 % to about 25 % by weight of hydrophilic polymers comprising of sodium alginate in an amount from about 0.1 % to about 20 % by weight, xanthan gum in an amount from about 0.1 % to about 20 % by weight, and hydroxypropyl methylcellulose in an amount from about 0.1 % to about 20 % by weight of controlled release matrix; and calcium sulphate in an amount from about 8 % to about 20 % by weight of sodium alginate.<br>
In a more preferred embodiment of the present invention, the pharmaceutical composition comprises from about 30 % to about 90 % by weight of cephalexin, cefaclor or their pharmaceutically acceptable hydrates, salts or esters and about 1 % to about 20 % by weight of hydrophilic polymers comprising of a medium or high viscosity grade sodium alginate in an amount from about 0.1 % to about 15 % by weight, a medium or high viscosity grade xanthan gum in an amount from about 0.1 % to about 15 % by weight, and a medium or high viscosity grade hydroxypropyl methylcellulose in an amount from about 0.1 % to about 15 % by weight of controlled release matrix; and calcium sulphate in an amount from about 8 % to about 16 % by weight of sodium alginate.<br>
In one more preferred embodiment of the present invention, the pharmaceutical composition comprises from about 30 % to about 90 % by weight of cephalexin, cefaclor or their<br>
9<br><br>
stearic acid, magnesium stearate, colloidal silicon dioxide, calcium stearate, zinc stearate, hydrogenated vegetable oil and the like. Preferably the lubricant is magnesium stearate.<br>
The immediate release probenecid part of the present invention contains a disintegrating agent at concentration in the range of about 2 % to about 9 % by weight of immediate release part. Preferably the disintegrating agent is sodium starch glycolate.<br>
The pharmaceutical composition of the present invention may be prepared by procedures well known to formulation chemists. The method of manufacturing can affect the release characteristics of the composition. All the hydrophilic polymers are uniformly pre-blended with calcium sulphate, followed by the active ingredient; one or more water soluble or water dispersible diluents are either mixed together with lubricants and the blend is directly compressed into tablets or are granulated by compaction followed by sieving and the granules obtained are compressed into tablets. The active ingredient can be given as controlled release tablets for once or twice a day administration or as controlled release tablet along with separate probenecid tablets as a combipack to be administered simultaneously or coupled with probenecid into a single monolithic or bilayered tablets for once a day administration. The fines incorporated in the blend of active granules form about 12 % to about 30 % by weight of controlled release part, preferably from about 12 % to about 20 %.<br>
For the purpose of this patent application, fines denote the particles having size less than 250 microns.<br>
The above-mentioned process has the advantage over its granulation by aqueous or non¬aqueous vehicle used conventionally. The active ingredient such as cephalexin or cefaclor, which are sensitive to moisture and heat, can be effectively processed without any difficulty. The polymers used in the composition of present invention, xanthan gum and sodium alginate also are unstable above 60° C and 70° C respectively. As the process is devoid of use of any solvents the potential problem of limiting the residual organic solvent is eliminated.<br>
The controlled release matrix formulation of the present invention is not a mere admixture but has properties different from the sum total of the properties of its ingredients.<br>
11<br><br>
The probenecid part of the composition is prepared by mixing probenecid and one or more water soluble or water dispersible diluents together with lubricants and the blend is granulated by compaction followed by sieving and the granules obtained are lubricated and compressed into a tablet. The fines incorporated in the blend form about 10 % to about 30 % by weight of immediate release part, preferably from about 10 % to about 20 %.<br>
The modified release matrix formulation not containing probenecid prepared according to present invention may be administered once or twice daily. For example, the effective therapeutic dose of the active that can be administered by compositions of present invention include 375 mg to 750 mg active twice daily or 750 mg to 1500 mg active once daily.<br>
The modified release matrix formulation containing probenecid prepared according to present invention may be administered once daily. The effective therapeutic dose of the active that can be administered by compositions of present invention include 500 mg to 1000 mg active and 500 mg to 1000 mg probenecid once daily.<br>

It would be evident from the above, that incorporation of a calcium salt such as calcium sulphate as a matrix stabilizing agent advantageously favours maintaining the stability of the composition as a control release formulation, and can maintain its dissolution characteristics after storage at accelerated conditions. Additionally, the use of a hydroxypropyl methylcellulose in addition to a xanthan gum and a sodium alginate, though provides composition, which maintains its physical integrity/shape in the later stages of hydration, it does not provide a composition, which can maintain its dissolution characteristics after storage of samples at accelerated conditions.<br>
In accordance the further aspect of the invention the following illustrations demonstrate the selectivity in the use of calcium sulphate within the range of the 8 % -20 % by weight of sodium alginate in the controlled release formulation of the invention.<br>

The above results reveal that the initial release is retarded when higher concentration of calcium salt is used which is again not acceptable.<br>
The above illustrations clearly reveal that only when calcium salt is used in amounts within the range of 8 % - 20 % by -"■/eight of sodium alginate, the desired release profile and stability<br>

of the compositions can be maintained which is lost when the amount of calcium salt used is beyond the above selected range.<br>
Tablets without Probenecid -<br>
Cefaclor or cephalexin, a mixture of uniformly preblended hydrophilic polymers and calcium sulphate, lactose and/or microcrystalline cellulose were mixed uniformly and lubricated with magnesium stearate. The blend was compacted and the slugs obtained were milled to form granules. The-sized granules were blended with the fines and the remaining lubricant and further compressed into tablets.<br>
For Example 1 to Example 5, the tablets were tested for cefaclor release in 900 ml of 0.1 N hydrochloric- acid for 1 hr, after which the dissolution medium was changed to pH 6.8 phosphate buffer 900 ml. The dissolution medium (pH 6.8 phosphate buffer) was replaced with fresh medium every hour thereafter. The tablets were placed into a 40 mesh basket (USP apparatus type-I) and were rotated at 100 rpm.<br>
For the examples containing cefaclor the dissolution medium (pH 6.8 phosphate buffer) was replaced with fresh medium every hour thereafter. For the examples containing cephalexin only aliquots and not all of the pH 6.8 phosphate buffer were withdrawn and replaced with fresh medium at each interval. Example 1<br><br>
