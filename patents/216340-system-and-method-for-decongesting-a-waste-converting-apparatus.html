				<td>SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR DECONGESTING WASTE FOR A WASTE<br>
CONVERTING APPARATUS<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a system and method for decongesting waste<br>
for a waste converting apparatus including the processing, treatment or disposal<br>
of waste. In particular, the present invention is directed to a system and method<br>
for decongesting a furnace in a plasma torch based waste processing plant.<br>
Background<br>
The processing of waste including municipal waste, medical waste, toxic and.<br>
radioactive waste by means of plasma-torch based waste processing plants is<br>
well known. Referring to Figure 1, a typical prior art plasma-based processing<br>
plant (1) comprises a processing chamber (10) typically in the form of a vertical<br>
shaft, in which typically solid, and also mixed (i.e., generally, solid plus liquid<br>
and/or semiiiquid), waste (20) is introduced at the upper end thereof via a waste<br>
inlet means comprising an air lock arrangement (30). One or a plurality of plasma<br>
torches (40) at the lower end of the chamber (10) heats the column (35) of waste<br>
in the chamber (10), converting the waste into gases that are channeled off via<br>
outlet (50), and a liquid material (38) (typically molten metals and/or slag) which<br>
is periodically or continuously collected at the lower end of the chamber (10) via<br>
reservoir (60). Oxidising fluid, such as air, oxygen or steam (70) may be<br>
provided at the lower end of the chamber (10) to convert carbon, produced in the<br>
processing of organic waste, into useful gases such as CO and H2, for<br>
example. A similar arrangement for dealing with solid waste is described in<br>
US 5,143,000, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference<br>
thereto.<br>
Two problems are commonly encountered that prevent smooth operation of<br>
such processing plants or fumaces:-<br>
(a) Unprocessed solid deposition.<br>
(b) Bridging.<br>
Waste material may comprise many different substances, some of which may<br>
have very high melting temperatures. Such substances may include, for<br>
example, refractory bricks, some types of rocks and stones, and also<br>
aluminium oxide (AI2O3). Furthermore, the waste may also contain products<br>
having a high aluminium content, and the aluminium may be oxidised to<br>
aluminium oxide by the hot oxidising means provided at the lower end of the<br>
chamber (10). The melting temperature for aluminium oxide is about 2050°C,<br>
and the melting point for other oxides that may also be found or formed<br>
within the waste column (35) include for example about 2825°C for<br>
Magnesium oxide (MgO), and about 2630°C for calcium oxide (CaO).<br>
However, the temperature at the lower end of the chamber (10), i.e., of the<br>
liquid material (38) is in the order of between about 1500°C and about<br>
1650°C. Thus, unprocessed solid deposition occurs when certain types of<br>
solid waste having a high melting temperature, or when some substances are<br>
transformed into oxides having a high melting temperature, rather than<br>
liquefy persist in a solid state during the normal operation of the furnace. The<br>
deposition of such solids at the lower end of the chamber (10) leads to<br>
blockage thereat, preventing run-off of liquid material (38) (typically molten<br>
metals and/or slag) to reservoir (60), as illustrated at (C) in Figure 1. The<br>
same problem may occur when the viscosity of molten material is increased<br>
significantly due to a change in its composition. Thus, while this problem<br>
does not directly affect the feed rate of the waste through chamber (10), the<br>
flow rate of the liquid material (38) may be drastically reduced or stopped,<br>
which indirectly results in some reduction in the flow rate of refuse through<br>
the chamber (10). In the art, such "unprocessed solids" need to be treated<br>
with fluxing agent, which enable the solids to dissolve therein, forming<br>
solutions with relatively lower crystallisation temperature and of lower<br>
viscosity than the unprocessed solids may have in the liquid state. The<br>
resulting solutions are subsequently melted and removed from the lower part<br>
of chamber (10) in the normal manner. For example, Calcium Oxide (CaO),<br>
and Aluminium Oxide (AI2O3) each have relatively high individual melting<br>
points. However, if mixed together with quartz (Silicon Oxide (SiO2)) in<br>
appropriate proportions (e.g., SiO2 - 62%, CaO - 23.25%, A12O3 - 14.75% ),<br>
the resulting mixture begins to melt at about 1165°C, and liquid droplets<br>
begin to form at about 1450°C, which is well within the temperature range<br>
existing at the lower end of the chamber (10). Similarly, while the existence<br>
of quartz (SiO2) or Aluminium Oxide (AI2O3) each increase viscosity and<br>
thus decrease the fluidity of liquid material "38), the addition of fluxing<br>
agents such as CaO, MgO, MnO, FeO serve to decrease viscosity of the<br>
liquid material (38) and thus to promote rur-off thereof. In some cases,<br>
Aluminium Oxide can act as a fluxing agent, tr.e addition of small quantities<br>
thereof to slag containing large amounts of CaO having the effect of lowering<br>
the viscosity of the mixture. Unprocessed solids may be dissolved in liquid<br>
slag if in contact therewith, since the liquid s ag comprises many different<br>
compounds in a dissociated state, enabling many different crystal<br>
compositions to be formed at different temperatures. The dissolving process<br>
is accelerated if the viscosity and surface tension of the melt are low, and<br>
these parameters will depend on the composition of the solids as well as of<br>
the melt, and on the temperature of the melt. It is also known that raising the<br>
temperature of the slag also serves to reduce its viscosity.<br>
In the prior art, if and when it is determined that solid deposition has<br>
occurred, fluxing agents are then provided at the top end of the chamber (10)<br>
(typically manually) at the waste inlet means of the apparatus, which is<br>
somewhat ineffective since the agents have to percolate through the whole<br>
column of refuse, or at least pass together with the refuse to the lower part of<br>
the chamber, which takes a lot of time. If there is also bridging within the<br>
chamber (10), the fluxing agents cannot be applied to the solids, and thus the<br>
furnace has to be shut down, the refuse removed from the chamber and the<br>
bridging destroyed manually, before the solids can be accessed. Of course, by<br>
then all of the slag at the lower end of the chamber (10) has also solidified.<br>
French Patent No. 2,708,217 describes a plasma-torch based system in which<br>
the plasma are is permanently submerged between the liquid products and the<br>
torch, within a reaction zone of the material being treated. Japanese Patent<br>
Publication Nos. JP 10 110917 and JP 10 089645 each describe a vertical<br>
melting furnace which is externally bulged to form a combustion space,<br>
thereby enabling continuous waste disposal and for the prevention of<br>
bridging. Japanese Patent Application No.05346218 describes a waste<br>
melting furnace in which a waste feed device, and air feed pipe and an<br>
auxiliary fuel feed device are provided to monitor and control melting<br>
conditions of the waste in order to minimise consumption of the auxiliary<br>
fuel. US 4,831,944 describes another type of furnace wherein the plasma jets<br>
are inclined with respect to the corresponding radius of the column.<br>
US 4,848,250 is directed to an apparatus and method for converting refuse to<br>
thermal energy, metal and slag devoid of particulate material. However, none<br>
of these references are directed to the problem of unprocessed solids<br>
deposition, nor do they provide a solution therefore, less so in the manner of<br>
the present invention.<br>
The bridging phenomenon relates to a blockage that occurs as a result of the<br>
passage of solid material through a channel such as the chamber (10), the<br>
problem being further exacerbated when some of the solids liquefy. Many<br>
organic materials that may be found in the waste column (35) undergo a<br>
number of transformations during processing in the chamber (10). These<br>
transformations include, as a function of increasing temperature, the<br>
formation of gas products, the formation of liquid and semi-liquid pitch or<br>
bitumen, the evaporation of the pitch and charcoal or coke formation at high<br>
temperatures. These transformations may be occurring simultaneously at<br>
different parts of the furnace due to the temperature profile in the chamber<br>
(10). Thus, while raw or unprocessed waste may be found at the upper end of<br>
the waste column (35), the organic materials are converted to charcoal at the<br>
bottom end of the waste column (35), and to bitumen in a central portion of<br>
the waste column (35).<br>
During the bituminisation process of the organic waste, several pieces of<br>
bituminised waste may coalesce to form a full or partial bridge blockage in<br>
the furnace, as illustrated at (A) in Figure 1.<br>
Inorganic waste is normally dealt with at the lower, hotter parts of the<br>
chamber (10). Because of the non-homogenous composition of the waste and<br>
the temperature profile within the chamber (10), some inorganic waste may<br>
melt at higher portions of the chamber (10), and flow downwards, adhering to<br>
other waste and in some cases causing several pieces of waste to adhere to<br>
one another, resulting in a blockage. In fact, the molten waste may adhere to<br>
the walls of the chamber (10) and even crystalise there if the wall temperature<br>
is lower than the melting point of the waste, also leading to a bridge-type<br>
phenomenon within the chamber (10).<br>
Another type of bridging phenomenon may occur as a direct result of the<br>
passage of solid waste through the furnace - a bridge-type formation, similar<br>
to a vaulted ceiling in form, can occur naturally within the refuse column,<br>
particular when the refuse is in granulated form, as illustrated at (B) in Figure<br>
1. The bridge-type formation provides a stable load bearing structure for the<br>
column of refuse, redirecting the weight of the column from the centre<br>
thereof to the edges in contact with the walls of the chamber (10), thereby<br>
preventing the flow of refuse via gravity through the furnace. The presence of<br>
a bridging phenomenon within the chamber (10) results in a reduction or total<br>
stoppage of the feed rate of waste through chamber (10).<br>
Japanese Patent Application No.__1001922 lA2- adresses a bridging<br>
phenomenon problem by providing a number of mechanical devices which<br>
are inserted into the column of refuse from the sides or from the top of the<br>
furnace. These devices provide an external mechanical force to the waste in a<br>
direction towards the inside of the furnace, accomplished by either rotating<br>
members or axially displaceable members. While possibly effective in some<br>
cases, the mechanical devices are subject to a great deal of wear and tear and<br>
to high thermal stresses, and need to be replaced or serviced fairly frequently.<br>
Further, when not needed, the devices actually represent a partial blockage<br>
with respect to the column. The devices are also able to directly apply force<br>
in relatively isolated points within the furnace. Furthermore, incorporation of<br>
such mechanical devices in a furnace made from refractory material is not<br>
straightforward.<br>
In order to address either bridging or solid deposition within the processing<br>
chamber of a plant, the first step is to identify the presence thereof. This not a<br>
simple matter, and is in fact significantly complicated in many instances by<br>
other factors.<br>
For example, one indicator of the presence of bridging and/or of solid<br>
deposition is a decrease in the flow rate of waste through the processing<br>
chamber. However, as explained in more detail below, the changing<br>
composition of the waste itself may also affect the waste flow rate.<br>
The composition of waste provided to the processing chamber may vary<br>
tremendously over any given time period, and may include any relative<br>
proportions of organic to inorganic waste, and any relative proportion of<br>
liquids to solids. While organic waste is converted into product gases (using<br>
oxygen containing reagents), inorganic waste needs to be melted to a liquid,<br>
whose viscosity will depend on the constitution of the inorganic waste and<br>
the temperature thereof. Thus, if the waste that is fed to the processing<br>
chamber comprises a high proportion of inorganic material, there may be a<br>
decrease in the flow rate of waste through the chamber and/or solid<br>
deposition, simply because the primary plasma torches cannot deal with the<br>
large quantity of inorganic waste quickly enough. It is not generally possible<br>
to measure the concentration of some of the inorganic components of the<br>
waste - such as stones and glass, for example - and usually visual monitoring<br>
of the waste by the plant operators is the only way of providing any estimate<br>
regarding the composition of any batch of waste being fed to the plant. When<br>
it is determined that the waste comprises a high degree of inorganic waste,<br>
then either the waste needs to be diluted with organic waste, or the feed rate<br>
to the processing chamber needs to be reduced.<br>
On the other hand, a different problem is encountered when the waste<br>
comprises high levels of organic waste. Here, carbon in the form of coke or<br>
charcoal is produced at higher than normal amounts after drying and<br>
pyrolysis of the waste. Correspondingly, greater amounts of oxidising agents<br>
must be provided to convert the carbon to product gases. If the oxidising<br>
agents include steam, then more power is needed to be provided to the<br>
chamber since steam reacts with carbon endothermically. Unless more<br>
oxidising agents are provided together with greater power by the primary<br>
plasma torches, the flow rate of waste through the processing chamber will<br>
decrease, and it will then difficult to determine if the lowering in the waste<br>
flow rate is as a result of bridging or of coke build-up.<br>
Thus, the waste flow rate through the processing chamber is not only affected<br>
by the presence of bridging and/or solid deposition, but also by the actual<br>
composition of the waste.<br>
Another indication that there is solid deposition may be provided by an<br>
increase in the level of liquid product within the chamber. However, high<br>
viscosity of inorganic liquids at the lower end of the chamber also results in a<br>
slower rate of flow of liquid product, which in turn leads to a rise in the level<br>
thereof. It is not normally possible to determine whether the cause of a rising<br>
level of liquid product is solid deposition, or the high viscosity of the liquid<br>
product, or a mixture of the two. In any case, as in the case of solid<br>
deposition, fluxing agents as well as additional power to the chamber may<br>
help to lower the viscosity of the liquid product and thus provide a solution<br>
when this problem is encountered. Thus, the term "solid deposition" is also<br>
herein taken to include liquid product of relatively high viscosity, at least<br>
sufficient to significantly slow down the flow of liquid product to the<br>
reservoirs (60).<br>
It is therefore an aim of the present invention to provide a first system for<br>
dealing with solid deposition -type congestion phenomena which overcomes<br>
the limitations of prior art devices and methods.<br>
It is another aim of the present invention to provide such a system<br>
incorporated as an integral part of a plasma-torch based type mixed waste<br>
converter.<br>
It is another aim of the present invention to provide a second system for<br>
dealing with bridging-type congestion directly in a plasma-torch type<br>
processing apparatus.<br>
It is another aim of the present invention to provide such systems that are<br>
relatively simple mechanically and thus economic to produce as well as to<br>
maintain.<br>
It is another aim of the present invention to provide such a second system that<br>
incorporates a fluxing agent feed system for feeding fluxing agent directly<br>
into a plasma-torch type processing apparatus.<br>
It is another aim of the present invention to provide a method for operating a<br>
plasma-based waste processing plant such as to minimise blockages therein<br>
due to bridging and/or unprocessed solids.<br>
The present invention achieves these and other aims by providing at least one<br>
"and preferably a plurality of fluxing agent inlets at the lower part of the<br>
chamber such as to enable appropriate fluxing agents to be directly applied to<br>
the deposited "unprocessed solids" and/or to liquid products of high<br>
viscosity. The chamber may also be provided with at least one and preferably<br>
a plurality of auxiliary plasma torches at strategic locations within the<br>
chamber (10) and directed towards the waste column. When a bridge forms<br>
within the chamber (10) one or more auxiliary plasma torches may be<br>
operated such as to provide an additional heat source where needed. This heat<br>
source serves to quickly heat the organic solids and thus pass through the<br>
bituminsation stage and to the charcoal formation as quickly as possible. The<br>
additional heat source may be in the neighborhood of the bridge, but may<br>
also be near the bottom end of the chamber (10). In the latter case, the<br>
additional temperature at the bottom of the chamber (10) effectively moves<br>
the combustion and gasification zones for the charcoal to a higher part of the<br>
chamber, altering the temperature profile. This helps to pass the<br>
bituminisation stage quickly, and effectively destroys such bridges. The heat<br>
source also enables the inorganic wastes to be heated rapidly to pass beyond<br>
the melting stage relatively quickly. The debridging process may be further<br>
enhanced by providing secondary plasma torches at various levels upwards of<br>
the primary torches, the secondary torches at any level being operated as and<br>
when needed to achieve the desired effect. Further, the heat source also<br>
enables a thermal shock front to be directed at the bridge, disrupting and/or<br>
destroying and/or melting the bridge, which is also useful for dealing with<br>
bridge-type phenomena which occur naturally due to the flow of solids along<br>
the chamber (10).<br>

Disclosure of Invention<br>
The present invention will now be described by way of example with reference to the accompanying<br>
Figures.<br>
The present invention relates to a system for decongesting waste for a waste converting apparatus,<br>
not only, primarily by removing congestions when they occur, but also by providing preventive<br>
action. The term "waste converting apparatus" herein includes any apparatus adapted for treating,<br>
processing or disposing of any waste materials, including municipal waste, household waste,<br>
industrial waste, medical waste, nuclear waste and other types of waste. The present invention is<br>
also directed to such waste converting apparatus having the aforesaid system, and to methods of<br>
operating such systems and apparatuses. The apparatus typically comprises a waste converting<br>
chamber adapted for accommodating a column of waste, at least one primary plasma torch means<br>
for generating a hot gas jet at an output end thereof and for directing said jet towards a bottom<br>
longitudinal part of the chamber. The waste converting apparatus may further comprise at least one<br>
gas outlet means at an upper longitudinal part of the chamber, and at least one liquid product outlet<br>
at a lower longitudinal part of the chamber.<br>
In its simplest form, and in a first aspect of the present invention, the system for decongesting waste<br>
comprises : -<br>
at least one waste flow rate sensing means at least for detecting a first predetermined status<br>
of a flow rate of waste in said chamber;<br>
at least one liquid product level sensing means at least for detecting a second predetermined<br>
status of a liquid product level in said chamber;<br>
at least one secondary plasma torcn means naving an outlet in said<br>
chamber such that during operation of said system a high temperature<br>
zone may be selectively provided within said converting chamber for at<br>
least partially removing a bridge-type congestion from said chamber<br>
and/or to substantially prevent occurrence or propagation of such a<br>
congestion;<br>
said secondary plasma torch means being selectively operable at least<br>
in response to said predetermined first status and said predetermined<br>
second status being detected.<br>
In a second aspect of the present invention, the system for decongesting<br>
waste comprises:-<br>
at least one fluxing agent inlet means in said chamber separate from<br>
said waste inlet means, for selectively providing at least a quantity of at<br>
least one fluxing agent to a lower part of said chamber for at least<br>
partially removing a solid deposition type congestion and/or high<br>
viscosity liquid product-type congestion from said chamber, and/or to<br>
substantially prevent occurrence or propagation of such a congestion;<br>
at least one said liquid product level sensing means at least for<br>
detecting a third predetermined status of a liquid product level in said<br>
chamber;<br>
said at least one fluxing agent inlet means being selectively operable<br>
at least in response to said predetermined third status being detected.<br>
Referring to the Figures, Figures 2 and 3 illustrates a preferred, embodiment<br>
of trie" present invention according to the first aspect and second aspect<br>
thereof, respectively. The plasma waste processing apparatus, designated by<br>
the numeral (100), comprises a processing chamber (10), which while<br>
typically is in the form of a cylindrical or frusto-conical vertical shaft, may be<br>
in any desired shape. Typically, a solid or mixed waste feeding system (20)<br>
introduces typically solid waste at the upper end of the chamber (10) via a<br>
waste inlet means comprising an air lock arrangement (30). Mixed waste may<br>
also be fed into the chamber (10), though generally gaseous and liquid waste<br>
is removed from the apparatus (10) without substantial treatment. The<br>
solid/mixed waste feeding system (20) may comprise any suitable conveyor<br>
means or the like, and may further comprise a shredder for breaking up the<br>
waste into smaller, pieces. The air lock arrangement (30) may comprise an<br>
upper valve (32) and a lower valve (34) defining a loading chamber (36)<br>
therebetween. The valves (32), (34) are preferably gate valves operated<br>
electrically, pneumatically or hydraulically to open and close independently<br>
as required. A closeable hop arrangement (39) funnels typically solid and/or<br>
mixed waste from the feeding system (20) into the loading chamber (36)<br>
when the upper valve (32) is open, and the lower valve (34) is in the closed<br>
position. Feeding of waste into the loading chamber (36) typically continues<br>
until the level of waste in the loading chamber (36) reaches a predetermined<br>
point below full capacity, to minimise the possibility of any waste interfering<br>
with closure of the upper valve (32). The upper valve (32) is then closed. In<br>
the closed position, each of the valves (32), (34) provides an air seal. When<br>
required, the lower valve (34) is then opened enabling the waste to be fed<br>
into the processing chamber (10) with relatively little or no air being drawn<br>
therewith. The opening and closing of the valves (32), (34), and the feeding<br>
of waste from the feeder (20) may be controlled by any suitable controller<br>
(500), which may comprise a human controller and/or a suitable computer<br>
system operatively connected thereto and to other components of the<br>
apparatus (100). Preferably, a waste flow sensing system (530) is provided<br>
and operatively connected to the controller (500). The sensing system (530)<br>
typically comprises one or more suitable sensors (33) at an upper part or level<br>
(F) of the chamber (10) for sensing when the level of waste reaches this level.<br>
Similarly, the sensing system (530) typically also comprises one or more<br>
suitable sensors (33") at a level (E), vertically displaced downwards with<br>
respect to level (F) of the chamber (10), for sensing when the level of waste<br>
reaches this level. Level (F) may advantageously represent the maximum<br>
safety limit for waste in the chamber (10), while level (E) may represent a<br>
level of waste within the chamber (10) at which it is efficient to provide more<br>
waste to the chamber (10). Thus, the volume in the chamber (10) between<br>
level (E) and level (F) may be approximately equal to the volume of waste<br>
that may be accommodated in loading chamber (36). Alternatively, or<br>
additionally, the location of the sensors (33) and (331) at levels (F) and (E)<br>
may be chosen to provide suitable datums for determining an actual flow rate<br>
of the waste through the chamber (10) by measuring the time interval<br>
between the time when the level of waste is at level (F) to when it reaches<br>
level (E), for example. The controller (500) may also be operatively<br>
connected to valves (32), (34) to coordinate loading of the loading chamber<br>
(36) from the feeding system (20), and unloading of the waste from the<br>
loading chamber (36) to the processing chamber (10).<br>
Optionally, the hop arrangement (39) may comprise a disinfectant spraying<br>
system (31) for periodically or continuously spraying the same with<br>
disinfectant, as required, particularly when medical waste is being processed<br>
by apparatus (100).<br>
The processing chamber (10) is typically, but not necessarily, in the form of a<br>
cylindrical shaft having a substantially vertical longitudinal axis (18). The<br>
inner part of processing chamber (10) in contact with the waste column (35)<br>
is typically made from suitable refractory material, and has a bottom end<br>
comprising a liquid product collection zone (41), typically in the form of a<br>
crucible, having at least one outlet associated with one or more collection<br>
reservoirs (60). The processing chamber (10) farther comprises at the upper<br>
end thereof at least one primary gas outlet (50) for collecting primarily<br>
product gases from the processing of waste. The upper end of the processing<br>
chamber (10) comprises the said air lock arrangement (30), and the<br>
processing chamber (10) is typically filled with waste material via the airlock<br>
arrangement (30) up to about the level of the primary gas outlet (50). Sensing<br>
system (530) senses when the level of waste drops sufficiently (as a result of<br>
processing in the chamber (10)) and advises controller (500) to enable<br>
another batch of waste to be fed to the processing chamber (10) via the<br>
loading chamber (36). The controller (500) then closes lower valve (34) and<br>
opens upper valve (32) to enable the loading chamber (36) to be re-loaded via<br>
feeding system (20), and then closes upper valve (32), ready for the next<br>
cycle.<br>
One or a plurality of primary plasma torches (40) at the lower end of the<br>
processing chamber (10) are operatively connected to suitable electric power,<br>
gas and water coolant sources (45), and the plasma torches (40) may be of the<br>
transfer or non-transfer types. The torches (40) are mounted in the chamber<br>
(10) by means of suitably sealed sleeves, which facilitates replacing or<br>
servicing of the torches (40). The torches (40) generate hot gases that are<br>
directed downwardly at an angle into the bottom end of the column of waste.<br>
The torches (40) are distributed at the bottom end of the chamber (10) such<br>
that in operation, the plumes from the torches (40) heat the bottom of the<br>
column of waste, as homogeneously as possible, to a high temperature,<br>
typically in the order of about 1600°C or more. The torches (40) generate at<br>
their downstream output ends hot gas jets, or plasma plumes, having an<br>
average temperature of about 2000°C to about 7000°C. The heat emanating<br>
from the torches (40) ascends through the column of waste, and thus a<br>
temperature gradient is set up in the processing chamber (10). Hot gases<br>
generated by the plasma torches (40) support the temperature level in the<br>
chamber (10) which is sufficient for continuously converting the waste into<br>
product gases that are channeled off via outlet (50), and into a liquid material<br>
(38) that may include molten metal and/or slag, which may be periodically or<br>
continuously collected at the lower end of the chamber (10) via one or more<br>
reservoirs (60).<br>
Oxidising fluid (70), such as air, oxygen or steam may be provided at the<br>
lower end of the chamber (10) to convert carbon, produced in the processing<br>
of organic waste, into useful gases such as CO and H2, for example.<br>
The apparatus (100) may further comprise a scrubber system (not shown)<br>
operatively connected to the outlet (50), for removing particulate matter<br>
and/or other liquid droplets (including pitch), as well as any undesired gases<br>
(such as HC1, H2S, HF, for example) from the product gas stream leaving the<br>
chamber (10) via outlet (50). Particulate matter may include organic and<br>
inorganic components. Pitch may be contained in the gas stream leaving<br>
outlet (50) in gas or liquid form. Scrubbers capable of performing such tasks<br>
are well known in the art and do not require to be further elaborated upon<br>
herein. The scrubber is typically operatively connected downstream thereof to<br>
a suitable gas processing means (not shown) such as a gas turbine power<br>
plant or a manufacturing plant, for example, for economically utilising the<br>
cleaned product gases, typically comprising at this stage H2, CO, CH4, CO2<br>
and N2. The scrubber may further comprise a reservoir (not shown) for<br>
collecting particulate matter, pitch and liquid matter removed form the gas<br>
products by the scrubber. Such paniculate matter and liquid matter (including<br>
pitch) require further processing.<br>
Optionally, the apparatus (100) may further comprise an afterburner (not<br>
shown) operatively connected to the outlet (50) for burning organic<br>
components in the product gases and connected to suitable afterburner energy<br>
utilisation systems and also to off-gas cleaning systems (not shown). Such<br>
energy utilisation systems may include a boiler and steam turbine<br>
arrangement coupled to an electric generator. Off-gas cleaning systems may<br>
produce solid waste materials such as fly ash with reagents, and/or liquid<br>
solutions comprising waste materials which require further processing.<br>
In a first aspect of the present invention, and referring particularly to Figure<br>
2, at least a first chamber decongestion system (200) is provided for the<br>
removal of, and also for the prevention of the formation of, bridging<br>
phenomena within the chamber (10), thereby leading to a smoother and<br>
continuous operation of the plasma waste processing apparatus (100).<br>
Referring to Figure 2, in the preferred embodiment of the present invention,<br>
the first decongestion system (200) according to the first aspect thereof<br>
comprises at least one secondary plasma torch (240) situated within the<br>
chamber (10) between an upper portion of the chamber (10), and the primary<br>
plasma torches (40), and preferably between the gas outlet (50) and the<br>
primary plasma torches (40). More preferably, the system (200) comprises at<br>
least one secondary plasma torch (240) located within a lower longitudinal<br>
third of the chamber (10) taken vertically between the primary torch means<br>
(40) and the gas outlet means (50). Each secondary plasma torch (240) is<br>
operatively connected to suitable electric power, gas and water coolant<br>
sources (245), and the secondary plasma torches (240) are typically of the<br>
non-transfer types. The secondary plasma torches (240) are typically mounted<br>
in the chamber (10) by means of suitably sealed sleeves (250), which<br>
facilitate replacing or servicing of the torches (240). The torches (240)<br>
generate hot gases that may be directed towards a bridging formation (B) or<br>
(A) occurring within the column of waste. The secondary torches (240) are<br>
distributed within the chamber (10) such that in operation, the plumes from<br>
the torches (240) provide a high temperature heat blast, typically in the order<br>
of about 1600°C or more, to the bridge formation (A) or (B) to disrupt,<br>
destroy or melt the same. As with the primary plasma jets (40), the secondary<br>
plasma torches (240) generate at their downstream output ends hot gas jets, or<br>
plasma plumes, having an average temperature of about 2000°C to about<br>
7000°C. Additionally, the air or oxygen that may be used to operate the<br>
secondary plasma torches (240) also enable the oxidation of charcoal within<br>
the waste column (35). This exothermic process leads to a further increase in<br>
temperature within the chamber (10).<br>
Typically, and in contrast to the normal operation of the primary torches (40),<br>
the secondary torches (240) are only operated when a bridge phenomenon is<br>
in the process of forming, or is in fact already formed. Thus, rather than being<br>
operated continuously, the secondary torches (240) need only be used as and<br>
when required. Thus, the secondary torches (240) are subject to relatively less<br>
wear than the primary torches (40), and need relatively less maintenance.<br>
Alternatively, the secondary torches (240) may also be used intermittently<br>
preventively, providing a heat blast to the refuse column (35) at preset<br>
intervals, which may be determined statistically, for example, thereby<br>
preventing the formation of bridging phenomena. In any case, the secondary<br>
plasma torches (240) are preferably operatively connected to and thus<br>
controlled via, controller (500).<br>
Bridging phenomena of type (A) caused by vitrification or bituminisation are<br>
generally formed at the lower end of the chamber (10), and thus, one or more<br>
secondary torches (240) may be provided at this end to deal with such<br>
bridging phenomena. Bridging phenomena of type (B) are generally caused<br>
naturally by the downflow of solids, and its most likely location along the<br>
height of the chamber (10) may be estimated or empirically determined. The<br>
exact location, though, may depend on the average particle size and general<br>
homogeneity of the waste column (35). Accordingly, further secondary<br>
plasma torches (240) may be provided at such locations to deal with such<br>
bridging phenomena.<br>
Thus, a plurality of secondary torches (240) may be provided to chamber (10)<br>
at various heights disposed between the primary torches (40) and the gas<br>
outlet (50). The secondary plasma torches (240) may be distributed within the<br>
chamber (10) longitudinally and/or circumferentially. For example, one or<br>
more lower secondary torches (240) may be provided near the lower end of<br>
the chamber (10), but at a height above the primary torches (40), say at<br>
location (L) in Figure 2, typically within the lower third of the chamber (10)<br>
taken vertically between the primary plasma torches (40) and the gas outlet<br>
(50). Similarly, one or more further upper secondary torches (240) may be<br>
provided between the lower secondary torches (240) and the gas outlet (50),<br>
say at location (H) in Figure 2, typically within the middle third of the<br>
chamber (10). Similarly, more secondary torches may be provided at any<br>
desired height along chamber (10). Advantageously, the plurality of<br>
secondary torches (240) are also preferably angularly distributed with respect<br>
to the periphery of the chamber (10), i.e., viewed along the axis (18). Such a<br>
distribution of secondary torches (240) enables the temperature profile within<br>
the chamber (10) to be modified when required to remove bridging<br>
phenomena wherever they may occur within the chamber (10).<br>
Since not all secondary plasma torches (240) are necessarily used with the<br>
same frequency, the chamber (10) may be provided with at least one and<br>
preferably a plurality of application points (260) which are adapted for<br>
receiving a secondary plasma torch (240) and thus comprises a suitable<br>
sleeve (250) which can be selectively sealed to preventing communication<br>
between the chamber (10) and the outside when not needed. The apparatus<br>
may be provided with a plurality of said application points (250) distributed<br>
longitudinally and/or circumferentially with respect to the chamber (10).<br>
Thus, application points (260) may be provided at locations within the<br>
chamber (10) at which bridging phenomena occur relatively less frequently,<br>
or indeed at any other desired location, such that if a bridge is formed near<br>
such locations, a secondary plasma torch (240) may be inserted into the<br>
chamber via the sleeve (250) at the application point (260), and subsequently<br>
removed after dealing with the bridging phenomena. Thus, rather than<br>
providing numerous secondary plasma torches (240), the chamber (10) may<br>
be provided with a plurality of application points (260), each of which is<br>
provided with a secondary plasma torch (240) only when needed. This leads<br>
to less wear of the torches (240), as well as lower capital outlay for them. The<br>
application points (260) may be provided with,».means for operatively<br>
connecting the secondary torches (240) (when located therein) to the<br>
controller (500), or alternatively to an auxiliary control system for enabling<br>
these secondary torches to be actuated independently of controller (500).<br>
Additionally or alternatively, some of the secondary torches (240) at least<br>
may be adapted for swivelling within the chamber, as illustrated at (2 40") in<br>
Figure 2, to provide a greater geometric operating envelope therefor within<br>
the chamber (10).<br>
Preferably, at least one of the secondary torches (240) may be provided at the<br>
lower end of the chamber to increase the temperature thereof and thus alter<br>
the temperature profile within the chamber (10) such inorganic waste is<br>
melted quickly, and that organic waste is converted to charcoal quickly<br>
without allowing it to stay as bitumen for long. While such a configuration<br>
can thus be used as a curative feature to remove bridging phenomena, it may<br>
also be used in a preventative fashion, the secondary torches (240) being<br>
operated periodically (and in some cases perhaps continuously) in order to<br>
prevent bridging phenomena from forming in the first place.<br>
The presence of bridging phenomena within the chamber (10) may be<br>
indicated by the detection of a significant decrease in the flow rate of waste<br>
through the chamber (10), measured by the sensing system (530). Such a<br>
decrease may be relatively sharp, and may be manifested by the level of<br>
waste in the processing chamber (10) being substantially stationary or taking<br>
too long to reach level (E), for example. Thus, when controller (500) receives<br>
a signal from upper sensors (33) of the sensing system (530) indicating that<br>
the level of waste is at level (F), the controller (500) then expects the level of<br>
waste to reach level (E) within a predetermined time period after this event.<br>
This predetermined time period is typically correlated with the rate of<br>
processing of waste within the chamber (10) of a volume of waste<br>
corresponding to the volume of the chamber between level (F) and level (E).<br>
As such, the predetermined time period will depend on the composition of the<br>
waste previously provided to the chamber (10) and which is now lower down<br>
being processed. Determining the composition of the waste is not a<br>
straightforward task, and may require visual inspection of the waste before it<br>
is provided to the loading chamber (36), or, it may be decided to operate the<br>
apparatus with certain types of waste only at certain times. Thus, the<br>
predetermined time period may have to be quite large to take account of the<br>
possibility that the composition of waste within the chamber (10) is strongly<br>
biased towards inorganic waste,, for example, and this is causing a slowing<br>
down of the pyrolysis waste disposal process in the chamber (10), longer than<br>
predetermined.<br>
In other words, the level of the waste column within the chamber (10) may<br>
remain substantially stationary or decrease very slowly (while no new waste<br>
is added thereto), and this is determined by the controller (500). (In some<br>
cases, the waste level may be stuck at the upper point, i.e., at level (F), and<br>
thus the controller (500) is also adapted to expect the level of waste to at least<br>
fall from (F) within the same or different time period.)<br>
The presence of bridging phenomena is generally also accompanied by a<br>
reduction in the amount of output or product gases produced, and of the<br>
amount of liquid product produced, since less waste is being processed due to<br>
the congestion in the waste column (35). The decrease in production of<br>
product gases may be determined by monitoring the flow rate of the product<br>
gases through the gas outlet (50). However, there are a number of difficulties<br>
associated with this. Firstly, product gases may contain high levels of tar,<br>
paniculate solids and also liquid vapours, rendering any flow measurement<br>
inaccurate. Secondly, while the product gas output may be down (also due to<br>
the fact that it is also more difficult for gases to flow upwards in the chamber<br>
(10) due to the bridging phenomena), the oxidising gases are still being<br>
provided at the lower end of the chamber (10), and these gases are also<br>
exhausted via the outlet (50).<br>
The reduction in the production rate of liquid product may be determined by<br>
detecting a reduction in the level of liquid product at the liquid product<br>
collection zone (41). This is usually a better indicator of the presence of<br>
bridging than monitoring the flow rate of liquid product to the reservoirs<br>
(60), since if the liquid product has high viscosity and/or solid deposition has<br>
occurred, the output of liquid product to the reservoirs (60) will also be<br>
decreased or stopped altogether. However, there may also be cases in which<br>
notwithstanding having a bridging phenomenon present in the chamber (10),<br>
the level of liquid product in the collection zone (41) does not decrease (or at<br>
least very slowly) due to high viscosity of the liquid product and/or the<br>
presence of solid deposition. Moreover, a lowering of the liquid product level<br>
may also be due to the composition of previously processed waste having a<br>
relatively low proportion of inorganic waste. Thus, while a lowering of the<br>
liquid product level in the collection zone (41) may indicate the presence of<br>
bridging, the lack of such this decrease is thus inconclusive. On the other<br>
hand, when bridging occurs, it is very unlikely that the level of liquid product<br>
will increase. Thus, the preferred parameter in the present invention for<br>
monitoring the liquid product for the determination of bridging is whether the<br>
level of liquid product in collection zone (41) has increased, providing, in the<br>
negative, a necessary though not sufficient condition therefor. For this<br>
purpose one or more liquid level detectors (46) are provided to detect<br>
whether or not the liquid product level has increased beyond a predetermined<br>
level, and the detectors (46) are operatively connected to the controller (500).<br>
Such detectors (46) may be simple visual indicators that enable the operator<br>
to view directly the liquid level, and may be in the form of a suitable window,<br>
for example, located near the collection zone (41).<br>
Thus, referring in particular to Figures 5 and 6, when the controller (500)<br>
determines that the waste flow rate through the chamber (10) has been<br>
reduced below a predetermined limit as described above, and that the level of<br>
the liquid products in the collection zone (41) is not above a predetermined<br>
limit, this determination provides a high probability that bridging has in fact<br>
occurred within the chamber (10) and corrective action is required.<br>
Since the location of bridging phenomena within the chamber (10) may<br>
sometimes be random or quasi-random, the corrective action is preferably by<br>
activating the secondary torches (240), preferably in a manner such as to<br>
maximise the effectiveness thereof. Thus, in the first instance the lower<br>
secondary torches (240), for example as located at (L) in the Figures, are first<br>
activated. The temperature of waste material in column (35) will be increased<br>
not only because of the additional thermal energy provided by the secondary<br>
plasma jets, but also because of exothermic reactions between charcoal and<br>
additional oxygen supplied via the secondary torches. The temperature<br>
profile within the chamber (10) is thus changed which may enable the<br>
bridging phenomena to be overcome. If the temperature profile change is<br>
insufficient to overcome the bridging phenomena, the secondary torches<br>
(240) provided at the next level, say at (H), above the previous secondary<br>
torches are then operated, in addition to or instead of, the latter, and such<br>
sequencing of secondary torches continues as necessary up the chamber (10).<br>
The sequencing of the secondary torches are preferably controlled by the<br>
controller (500), but may instead be controlled by any other suitable<br>
controlling means such as a computer for example, to each provide a heat<br>
blast of suitable intensity and duration in a predetermined sequence such as<br>
that described, for example, along the height and circumference of the<br>
chamber (10). In rare cases where the bridging phenomena persist, additional<br>
secondary plasma torches (240) may be provided and operated via suitable<br>
application points (250). The extent of this activation, in particular how many<br>
torches are provided, in which order they are activated, whether continuously<br>
or in bursts, and for how long, may be decided according to any suitable plan,<br>
which may be modified with time according to experience gained with any<br>
particular apparatus (100).<br>
If it is determined that while the waste flow rate through the chamber (10) is<br>
below limits, nevertheless the level of liquid products is increasing, this may<br>
be indicative of the presence of solid deposition and/or high viscosity liquid<br>
product.<br>
If it is determined that the waste flow rate through the chamber (10) is not<br>
below limits, i.e., nominal, but nevertheless the level of liquid products is<br>
increasing, this is indicative of either (a) that the. waste contains a high<br>
percentage of inorganic waste; and/or (b) that solid deposition and/or high<br>
viscosity of the liquid product is present. Correction action for (a) is<br>
relatively simple, requiring the primary torches (40) to be used at a higher<br>
rating, for example, and/or for organic waste proportion of the waste to be<br>
increased. Corrective action for (b) in addition to, and also independent from,<br>
dealing with bridging phenomena, is discussed below. In order to assess the<br>
likelihood of either (a) or (b) or a combination of both is the cause of the<br>
symptoms detected by controller (500), waste composition determination<br>
means (21) are provided to monitor the waste before., it is fed into the chamber<br>
(10). The simplest form of such means (21) is a visual monitoring means and<br>
a human operator thereof to visually scan the waste, which often provides a<br>
fair indication of whether the waste is organic-rich or inorganic-rich. Another<br>
way to enable the controller (500) to discriminate between cause (a) and<br>
cause (b) is by analysis of the product gases flowing out via outlet (50),<br>
and/or their flow rate. A lower than normal flow rate of product gases such as<br>
CO?, CO, H2 or hydrocarbons, for example, indicates that there may be a high<br>
probability of (a).<br>
In a second aspect of the present invention, at least a second chamber<br>
decongestion system (300) is provided for the removal of, and also for the<br>
prevention of the formation of, unprocessed solid deposition within the •<br>
chamber (10), and/or for dealing with high viscosity liquid product, thereby<br>
leading to a smoother and continuous operation of the plasma waste<br>
processing apparatus (100).<br>
Referring to Figur 3 in the preferred embodiment of the present invention<br>
according to the second aspect thereof, the second decongestion system (300)<br>
comprises at least one fluxing agent inlet (320) situated within the chamber<br>
(10) between the waste inlet means and the liquid product collection zone<br>
(41). Preferably, at least one fluxing agent is located between the gas outlet<br>
(50) and the liquid product collection zone (41), and more preferably between<br>
the gas outlet (50) and the primary plasma torches (40). Each fluxing agent<br>
inlet (320) is operatively connected to one or more fluxing agent sources<br>
(330) such that any desired fluxing agent may be provided to the chamber<br>
(10) at a location near to where unprocessed solids and/or high viscosity<br>
liquid products are deposited. The fluxing agents may be provided via inlet<br>
(320) preferably in powdered or granulated form, and thus an appropriate<br>
feed system, such as for example a worm feed device or a pneumatic feed<br>
device (for powdered fluxing agents), is associated with the inlet (320).<br>
Unprocessed solids (C) such as aluminium oxide, or its refractory<br>
compositions with other oxides, for example may be deposited at the liquid<br>
product collection zone (41) and in fact block the outlet to the collection<br>
reservoirs (60). The addition of an appropriate fluxing agent directly to the<br>
unprocessed solids (C) enables the solid to be processed, typically by<br>
enabling the unprocessed solid to dissolve in the fluxing agent and melt<br>
together at a substantially lower melting point than the melting point of the<br>
unprocessed solids and thus enabling the solids to melt and leave the chamber<br>
(10) to reservoirs (60). This is particularly so if the fluxing agents are in the<br>
molten state by the time that they come into contact with the unprocessed<br>
solids. Thus, preferably, the fluxing agent inlet means (320) is preferably<br>
vertically .spaced from the primary plasma torch means (40) by "a<br>
predetermined spacing such as to enable a fluxing agent provided to the<br>
chamber (10) via the fluxing agent inlet means (320) to be substantially<br>
melted by means of the heat provided by the primary torch means (40). This<br>
predetermined spacing is typically an optimal spacing - a larger spacing<br>
provides longer time for the fluxing agent to be heated, but also slows the<br>
rate at which the congestion (C) is removed; a shorter spacing does not<br>
generally allow enough time for all of the fluxing agent to melt. Thus, the<br>
optimal spacing may be different for each fluxing agent used, and thus a<br>
practical spacing may be chosen for any given system (300). Similarly,<br>
congestion due to slow-moving high-viscosity liquid product at the collection<br>
zone (41) may be further processed by suitable fluxing agents and/or heating-<br>
to reduce viscosity and enable the liquid products to flow out of the chamber<br>
(10) and to the reservoirs (60).<br>
Thus, preferably, a secondary plasma torch arrangement may be provided,<br>
comprising at least one secondary plasma torch (240) operatively connected<br>
to suitable electric power, gas and water coolant sources (245), the secondary<br>
plasma torches (240) being typically of the non-transfer types. At least one<br>
fluxing agent inlet (320) may be coupled to a secondary plasma torch (240) in<br>
a suitable mixing chamber (400), particularly if the fluxing agent is provided<br>
in powdered form. The hot plasma jets from the secondary plasma torch (240)<br>
also melt the fluxing agents and increase the temperature of the unprocessed<br>
solids as well as of the molten material resulting from the processing of the<br>
waste column (35). The secondary plasma torches (240) are sufficiently<br>
displaced vertically from the collection zone (41) to give the fluxing agent<br>
sufficient time to melt before they act on the unprocessed solids.<br>
Additionally, the air or oxygen that may be used to operate the secondary<br>
plasma torches (240) also enable the oxidation of charcoal within the waste<br>
column (35). This exothermic process leads, to a further increase in<br>
temperature within the chamber (10).<br>
Particularly when the fluxing agents are not provided in powdered form, but<br>
instead in granulated form, the fluxing agent inlet (320) is provided in<br>
chamber (10) at a sufficient height above the secondary torches (240) such<br>
that when the latter are operated (typically in synchronisation with the<br>
introduction of the fluxing agents), a sufficiently high temperature is<br>
provided between them to permit the fluxing agents to melt before reaching<br>
the unprocessed solids. Thus, at least one fluxing agent inlet (320) may be<br>
provided between the pyrolysis and the melting zones of the chamber (10),<br>
particularly if the fluxing agent is provided in granulated form, since the<br>
fluxing agent has more time to fully melt before acting on the unprocessed<br>
solids.<br>
Suitable fluxing agent may include, for example, any one or more from<br>
among SiO2 (or sand), CaO (or CaCO3), MgO, Fe2O35, K2O, Na2O, CaF2,<br>
borax, dolomite, or other fluxing material, as well as compositions<br>
comprising one or more of these materials.<br>
While the presence of deposited unprocessed solids within the chamber (10)<br>
that are blocking passage of liquid product to reservoirs (60) may be<br>
accompanied by a relatively slow decrease in the waste throughput flow rate<br>
through the chamber (10), it is characterised, rather, by a relatively sharp<br>
decrease in the flow rate of liquid product to the reservoirs (60) and in<br>
particular by an increase in the level of liquid product (38) within the<br>
collection zone (41). Thus, while the presence of unprocessed solids (C) may<br>
cause a raise in the level of liquid products in the collection zone (41), it<br>
doesn"t generally initially affect the processing of the waste column (35), or<br>
therefore the flow rate thereof or the amount of product gases produced.<br>
As in the .first aspect of thjej^resent; invention, liquid level detectors (46) at<br>
the liquid product collection zone (41) are provided for monitoring the level<br>
of liquid product (38) thereat. Referring to Figure 3, the detectors (46) are<br>
operatively connected to a suitable controller (600), which is similar to that<br>
described for controller (500) of the first aspect of the present invention,<br>
mutatis mutandis. Controller (600) is also operatively connected to the<br>
second decongestant system (300) to activate the secondary torches (240) and<br>
or to feed any particular fluxing agent via inlets (320) as required, to remove<br>
the blockage to the outflow of liquid product caused by the deposited solids<br>
and/or high viscosity liquid product. As with the first aspect of the present<br>
invention, such detectors (46) may be simple visual indicators that enable the<br>
operator to view directlythe liquid level, and may be in the form of a suitable<br>
window, for example, located near the collection zone (41).<br>
Referring to Figures 3 and 7, when the controller (600) determines that the<br>
level of liquid products (38) in the collection zone (41) is above<br>
predetermined limits, this determination provides a high probability that<br>
either (a) that the waste contains a high percentage of inorganic waste; and/or<br>
(b) that solid deposition and/or high viscosity of the liquid product is present.<br>
As discussed in relation to the first aspect of the invention, correction action<br>
for (a) is relatively simple, requiring the primary torches (40) to be used at a<br>
higher rating, for example, and/or for organic waste proportion of the waste<br>
to be increased. In order to assess the likelihood of either (a) or (b) or a<br>
combination of both is the cause of the symptoms detected by controller<br>
(600), waste composition determination means (21) are also provided to<br>
monitor the waste before it is fed into the chamber (10), as described with<br>
respect to the first aspect of the invention, mutatis mutandis. Another way to<br>
enable the controller (600) to discriminate between cause (a) and cause (b) is<br>
by analysis of the product gases flowing out via outlet (50), and/or their flow<br>
rate. A lower than normal flow rate of product gases such as CO2, CO, Ho or<br>
hydrocarbons, for example, indicates that there may be a high probability of<br>
(a).<br>
If it is determined that there is a high probability that (b) is the cause for the<br>
symptoms monitored by controller (600), corrective action as follows is<br>
provided. Firstly, no more waste is provided to the chamber (10) until<br>
nominal conditions are achieved with respect to the liquid product level. In<br>
embodiments such as that illustrated in Figure 3 in which secondary plasma<br>
torches (240) are provided, these are first activated, typically via commands<br>
received from controller (700). The temperature of waste material in column<br>
(35) will be increased, in particular the temperature of the contents of the<br>
collection zone (41). The higher temperature may enable any solids deposited<br>
in the collection zone (41) to melt, and may reduce the viscosity of liquid<br>
products, facilitating their removal therefrom and to the reservoirs (60). If<br>
this happens, the level of liquid product drops, eventually to at least the<br>
predetermined level, and when this is determined by the controller (600), the<br>
secondary torches (240) are deactivated. The extent of this activation, in<br>
particular how many torches are provided, in which order they are activated,<br>
whether continuously or in bursts, and for how long, may be decided<br>
according to any suitable plan, which may be modified with time according to<br>
experience gained with any particular apparatus (100). The controller (600)<br>
then determines whether or not the temperature increase provided by the<br>
secondary torches (240) has been sufficient to overcome the solid<br>
deposition/high liquid product viscosity problem. For example, if the liquid<br>
product level has not decreased sufficiently in a given time period (which<br>
may be variable and depend on factors such as known or suspected<br>
composition of the waste, for example), this may be sufficient indication to<br>
provide this determination. Thus, when the activation of the secondary<br>
plasma torches is not completely effective, or in embodiments not comprising<br>
the same, the controller (600) activates the introduction of fluxing agent to<br>
the chamber (10) via one or more fluxing inlets. (320). Optionally, the<br>
secondary torches (240) may also be activated concurrently with the<br>
introduction of fluxing agent, in particular in embodiments comprising a said<br>
mixing chamber (400).<br>
As illustrated in Figure 4, a third embodiment of the present invention<br>
incorporates the flow decongestant systems (200) and (300) according to the<br>
first and second aspects, respectively, of the present invention in a common<br>
waste disposal apparatus (100). Thus, the third embodiment of the present<br>
invention comprises all the components of the preferred embodiments<br>
according to the first and second aspects of the invention as described<br>
hereinbefore, mutatis mutandis, except that the controller (500) and the<br>
controller (600) are replaced by a controller (700) that serves the functions<br>
thereof.<br>
The third embodiment may be operated for dealing with bridging phenomena<br>
in a manner described with respect to the first aspect of the invention, mutatis<br>
mutandis. Similarly, the third embodiment may also be operated for dealing<br>
independently with solid deposition/high viscosity liquid products in a<br>
manner described with respect to the second aspect of the invention, mutatis<br>
mutandis. Preferably, the third embodiment operationally integrates the two<br>
operating modes. Thus, referring to Figure 8, the flow decongestant systems<br>
according to the third embodiment may be operated as follows.<br>
In step (I), the composition of the waste is monitored and if necessary<br>
adjusted by providing more organic or inorganic waste. In step (II), the level<br>
of liquid product is continuously or periodically monitored, typically via<br>
sensors (46). In step (Ilia), if the liquid product level is determined by the<br>
controller (700) to be above nominal conditions, the controller (700) then<br>
determines whether there is a high probability of solid deposition and/or high<br>
viscosity liquid product, and if so the second decongestion system may be<br>
operated as hereinbefore described with respect to the second aspect of the<br>
present invention, mutatis mutandis,(steps (IV) to (VII)). On the other hand,<br>
if the liquid product level is not above nominal conditions in step (IIIa), then<br>
the waste flow rate through the chamber (10) is continuously or periodically<br>
monitored, typically via waste flow rate sensing means (530) (step (Illb)). If<br>
the controller (700) then determines that the flow rate is within predetermined<br>
parameters, monitoring of the waste flow rate and liquid products level is<br>
continued and the processing of waste continues normally. However, if the<br>
controller (700) determines that the waste flow rate has decreased and that at<br>
the same time the liquid product level is not above nominal conditions, the<br>
controller (700) then determines whether there is a high probability of<br>
bridging phenomena having occurred, and if so the first decongestion system<br>
may be operated as hereinbefore described with respect to the first aspect of<br>
the present invention, mutatis mutandis,(steps (IX) to (XII)).<br>
In Figure 9, an alternative operating mode for the third embodiment is<br>
illustrated, the main difference between this mode and the operating mode in<br>
Figure 8 being that step (Illb), monitoring the waste flow rate, is performed<br>
before step (Ilia), monitoring the liquid product level.<br>
Alternatively, monitoring of the liquid product level and of the waste flow<br>
rate may be continuous, and thus steps (Ilia) and (Illb) may be combined in a<br>
single symptoms-evaluating step.<br>
While the flow decongestant systems according to the first and second<br>
aspects are best incorporated as an integral part of a plasma-type mixed waste<br>
converter, it is clear that the systems of the present invention are each readily<br>
retrofittable, separately or together, on any one of a large number of<br>
plasma-based waste converters of the art.<br>
While in the foregoing description describes in detail only a few specific<br>
embodiments of the invention, it will be understood by those skilled in the art<br>
that the invention is not limited thereto and that other variations in form and<br>
details may be possible without departing from the scope and spirit of the<br>
invention herein disclosed. <br>
