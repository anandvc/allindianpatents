				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to a feed unit for feeding fuel out of<br>
a fuel tank of « motor vehicle, having a baffle which has a first<br>
chamber for collecting fuel having a fuel pump for sucking up<br>
fuel and having a fuel-pump suction opening arranged in the<br>
vicinity of the bottom of the first chamber of the baffle.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Feed units of this type are frequently used in motor<br>
vehicles today and are known in pratice. The chamber of the<br>
baffle generally has a bottom valve and is filled with fuel via a<br>
suction jet pump driven by the fuel pump. In addition the baffle<br>
is arranged in a bottom region of the fuel tank so that fuel can<br>
flow out of the fuel tank into the baffle via the bottom valve.<br>
The filling of the baffle via the suction jet pump ensures that<br>
even of there is a very low fuel level in the fuel tank the<br>
baffle is sufficiently filled with fuel.<br>
When the fuel tank is empty the baffle is also emptied as<br>
a result of which the fuel-pump suction opening emerges out of<br>
the fuel. Before the fuel pump can feed fuel again sufficient<br><br>
fuel has to be poured into the fuel tank* for example by means of<br>
a terrycan, for fuel to penetrate into the baffle. Only when the<br>
fuel-pump suction opening is resubmerged into the fuel can the<br>
fuel pump feed fuel. However a minimum quantity of fuel is<br>
required for this.<br>
It is already been thought to arrange the baffle directly<br>
below a filler neck of the fuel tank. In this case the baffle is<br>
filled at the beginning when the fuel is poured in. However this<br>
arrangement of the baffle is frequently impossible in the case of<br>
fuel tanks nowadays* which are generally very shallow and angled.<br>
US 6606980 discloses a fuel tank for a motor vehicle is<br>
provided with a reservoir* which is accessible through a closable<br>
opering in the wall of the fuel tank. In order to be able to<br>
select the size of the reservoir independently of the size of the<br>
opening, the reservoir comprises at least two modules <br>
which can be connected to each other and which are assembled<br>
within the tank to form the reservoir. At least one module of<br>
the reservoir can already be inserted into the tank when<br>
producing the tank. Additional modules can be inserted into the<br>
finished tank through the opening in the wall of the tank. It is<br><br>
2A.<br>
also possible for all modules forming the reservoir to be<br>
subsequently inserted into the tank through the opening in the<br>
wall of the tank.<br>
US 4354521 describes a device in a fuel tank for motor<br>
vehicles which if the fuel level is low when driving on an<br>
inclined surface retains a required amount of fuel around the<br>
fuel line opening to prevent air intake. Around a container on<br>
the tank bottom* into which the fuel line opens* is a larger<br>
container and the two containers have inlets for fuel from the<br>
surrounding tank. One container has the inlet in its front side<br>
wall and the other container in its rear side wall as reviews in<br>
the longitudinal direction of the vehicle.<br>
The invention is based on the problem of designing a feed<br>
unit of the type mentioned at the beginning in such a manner<br>
that alter the first chamber of the baffle is emptied the fuel-<br>
pump suction opening is reliably covered with fuel.<br><br>
2B.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Tit is problem is solved according to the invention by a<br>
second chamber being connected to the first chamber via a valve*<br>
and by the valve being a throttle valve with the volumetric flow<br>
of fuel that is restricted by the valve being smaller than the<br>
volumetric flow fed by the fuel pump.<br>
This design makes it possible for the first chamber to be<br>
initially emptied, as in the case of the known feed unit after<br>
the fuel tank has been emptied. Over a period of time which im<br>
dependent an the throttling action of the valve, fuel flows out<br>
of the second chamber into the first chamber and covers the fuel-<br>
pump auction opening. Feeding of the fuel pump is ensured by the<br>
invention. If at the same time a small quantity of fuel is put<br>
into the fuel tank for example 	<br><br><br>
via the jerrycan, the feed unit according to the<br>
invention is capable of feeding the topped-up fuel.<br>
The feed unit according to the invention has a<br>
particularly low outlay on installation if the second<br>
chamber is manufactured integrally with the baffle.<br>
The second chamber could be arranged, for example,<br>
above the first chamber. However, according to another<br>
advantageous development of the invention, a filling of<br>
the second chamber can be ensured in a simple manner if<br>
the chambers are arranged at the same height. During<br>
the operation of the feed unit according to the<br>
invention, the second chamber, like the first chamber,<br>
can therefore be filled with fuel.<br>
The feed unit according to the invention has	a<br>
particularly low structural outlay if the valve	is<br>
arranged in a common wall of the first chamber and	of<br>
the second chamber.<br>
Acccrding to another advantageous development of the<br>
invention, the baffle turns out to be particularly<br>
compact if the second chamber is designed as an annular<br>
chamber surrounding the first chamber. By this means,<br>
the feed unit according to the invention can be<br>
arranged in a simple manner even in particularly<br>
shallow and angled fuel tanks.<br>
According to another advantageous development of the<br>
invention, a reliable filling of the second chamber<br>
with fuel can be ensured in a simple manner if the<br>
second chamber is arranged within the baffle and the<br>
common wall between the first chamber and the second<br>
chamber is lower than an outer wall of the baffle. Fuel<br><br><br>
can thus flow from the first chamber into the second chamber.<br>
According to another advantageous development of the invention<br>
the throttling of the fuel flowing from the second chamber into<br>
the first chamber requires a particularly low structural outlay<br>
if the valve is designed as an opening with a designated cross<br>
section.<br>
During the emptying of the first chamber the valve has to<br>
throttle an over flow of fuel out of the second chamber into the<br>
first chamber so that when the fuel tank is empty sufficient<br>
fuel remains in the second chamber. According to an advantageous<br>
development of the invention sufficient throttling of the<br>
overflowing fuel can be achieved in a simple manner with<br>
customary volumes of known baffles if the valve throttles the<br>
volumetric flow which flows from the second chamber into the<br>
first chamber in such a manner that the level is equalized in<br>
three to five minutes after the fuel pump has stopped.<br><br><br>
According to another advantageous development of the<br>
invention a sufficient fuel level in the first chamber after the<br>
fuel tank has been emptied can be reliably ensured if the second<br>
chamber has a volume of approximately 10 - 20% of the baffle<br>
volume.<br>
The invention permits numerous embodiments. To further clarify<br>
its basic principle* one of these is illustrated in the<br>
accompanying drawings and is described below. In the accompanying<br>
drawings:<br><br>
fig. 1 shows schematically a longitudinal section<br>
through a fuel tank with a feed unit according<br>
to the invention arranged therein,<br>
fig. 2 shows the feed unit according to the invention<br>
from figure 1 after the fuel tank has been<br>
topped up with a small quantity of fuel.<br>
Figure 1 shows schematically a longitudinal section<br>
through a fuel tank 1 for a motor vehicle, having a<br>
feec unit 2 which is arranged in the bottom region and<br>
is intended for feeding fuel out of the fuel tank 1 to<br>
an internal combustion engine 3 of the motor vehicle.<br>
The feed unit 2 has a baffle 4 with an electrically<br>
operated fuel pump 5 arranged therein. A suction<br>
opening 6 of the fuel pump 5 is arranged in the bottom<br>
region of a first chamber 7 of the baffle 4. A forward<br>
flow line 8 leads from the fuel pump 5 to the internal<br>
combustion engine 3. Furthermore, a suction jet pump 9<br>
is arranged in the bottom region and is supplied with<br>
fuel as the working fluid via a fuel line 10 branching<br>
off from the forward flow line 8. The suction jet pump<br>
9 sucks up fuel via a bottom valve 11 arranged on the<br>
baffle 4, and conveys the fuel into the first chamber 7<br>
of the baffle 4.<br>
A wall. 12 for separating off the first chamber 7 from a<br>
second chamber 13 is arranged in the baffle 4. The wall<br>
12 has a valve 14 which is designed as a throttle valve<br>
and permits fuel to flow through into the first chamber<br>
7. The wall 12 separating the chambers 7, 13 from each<br>
other is lower than an outer wall 15 of the baffle 4.<br>
This ensures that, during normal<br><br>
operation of the feed unit 2, the second chamber 13 is<br>
at all times filled with fuel.<br>
During the operation of the feed unit 2, the internal<br>
combustion engine 3 is supplied with fuel and at the<br>
same time the baffle 4 is filled with fuel, via the<br>
suction jet pump 9. The filling of the baffle 4 with<br>
fuel is ensured as long as the fuel level in the fuel<br>
tank 1 reaches as far as the bottom valve 11. If the<br>
fuel level drops below the bottom valve 11, the feed<br>
unit 2 supplies the internal combustion engine 3 with<br>
fuel until the first chamber 7 of the baffle 4 is<br>
empty, as illustrated in figure 1. The internal<br>
combustion engine 3 therefore does not obtain any fuel<br>
and the fuel pump stops. A topping-up of the fuel<br>
tank 1 with fuel takes place generally with a very<br>
small quantity. This quantity is generally sufficient<br>
in order to enable the level in the fuel tank 1 to rise<br>
again as far as the bottom valve; 11. Since, however,<br>
the suction opening 6 of the feed unit 2 in the baffle<br>
4 is arranged higher than the level in the fuel tank 1,<br>
the feed unit 2 can only suck up fuel again and the<br>
suction jet pump 9 can be supplied with fuel as the<br>
working fluid if the fuel level in the first chamber 7<br>
is higher than the suction opening 6 of the feed unit<br>
2.<br>
After the first chamber 7 has been emptied, fuel<br>
present in the second chamber 13 flows via the valve<br>
14, which is designed as a throttle valve, slowly into<br>
the first chamber 7, as illustrated in figure 2. The<br>
throttling action is configured in such a manner that<br>
the hydraulic equalizing operation lasts for three to<br>
five minutes. The flowing of the fuel through, into the<br>
first chamber 7 causes the suction opening 6 to again<br>
be situated below the fuel level. The feed unit 2 can<br>
therefore<br><br>
supply the internal combustion engine 3 and the suction<br>
jet pump 9 again with fuel.<br>
The throttling of the volumetric flow, which is guided<br>
5 into the first chamber 4, by the valve 14, which is<br>
designed as a throttle valve, is dimensioned in such a<br>
manner that the fuel flows more slowly into the first<br>
chamber 7 than the feed unit 2 feeds fuel to the<br>
internal combustion engine 3.<br><br>
