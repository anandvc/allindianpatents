COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
(See Section 10 and Rule 13) CONDITIONING SHAMPOO COMPOSITIONS<br>
 <br>
HINDUSTAN UNILEVER LIMITED, a company incorporated under<br>
the Indian Companies Act, 1913 and having its registered office<br>
at 165/166, Backbay Reclamation, Mumbai -400 020, Maharashtra, India<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed<br>
 <br>
 <br>
- 1 -<br>
CONDITIONING SHAMPOO COMPOSITIONS<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
5  This invention relates to aqueous conditioning shampoo compositions comprising a cleansing surfactant and a gel network.<br>
BACKGROUND AND PRIOR ART<br>
10<br>
Conditioning shampoo compositions comprising various combinations of cleansing surfactant and conditioning agents are known.  These products typically comprise an anionic cleansing surfactant in combination with a conditioning<br>
15  agent.  Amongst the most popular conditioning agents used in shampoo compositions are oily materials such as mineral oils, naturally occurring oils such as triglycerides and silicone polymers.  These are generally present in the shampoo as dispersed hydrophobic emulsion droplets.<br>
20  Conditioning is achieved by the oily material being<br>
deposited onto the hair resulting in the formation of a film.  Such compositions often have a relatively low viscosity and may be perceived to be low quality as a result.<br>
25<br>
Other conditioning shampoo compositions use gel networks comprising fatty alcohol to structure or thicken the product and also to deliver a conditioning benefit.  US 2003/0223952 (P&amp;G) discloses conditioning shampoos comprising detersive<br>
30      surfactant and a gel network made from fatty alcohol and a cationic surfactant.<br>
 <br>
- 2 -<br>
The use of particulate materials in conditioning shampoos is not common.  US 6,617,292 B2 (L'Oreal) discloses conditioning shampoos comprising aluminium oxide, an amphoteric or nonionic surfactant, a fatty acid or fatty 5  alcohol, and a cationic surfactant.<br>
A problem that arises with many of the conditioners disclosed in. the prior art is that they do not give good sensory benefits both when the hair is wet, i.e., during 10  and/or immediately after application and also when the hair is subsequently dried.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
15  The present inventors have found that excellent sensory benefits may be given to both wet and subsequently dried hair by use of conditioning shampoos comprising an anionic cleansing surfactants and a particularly structured gel network.  These conditioning shampoos also have the benefit<br>
20  of having a rich, creamy appearance, enhancing their perception of being high quality products.<br>
Conditioning shampoo compositions of the invention give good wet feel and ease of wet combing.  In addition they give 25  good dry feel, ease of dry combing, and manageability.<br>
In a first aspect of the invention, there is provided an aqueous conditioning shampoo composition comprising an anionic cleansing surfactant and a gel network comprising:<br>
 <br>
- 3 -<br>
(i)   a fatty material selected from C22-C22 fatty<br>
alcohol, C12-C22 fatty acid, C12-C22 fatty amide or<br>
mixtures thereof; and<br>
(ii)  hydrophobic particulates having a melting point of<br>
5	greater than that of the fatty material.<br>
In a second aspect of the invention, there is provided a method of cleansing and conditioning the hair comprising the application of an aqueous conditioning shampoo composition 10  according to the first aspect of the invention.<br>
In a third aspect of the invention, there is provided the use of a gel network comprising a fatty material selected<br>
from C12-C22 fatty alcohol, C12-C22 fatty acid, C12-C22 fatty 15  amide or mixtures thereof and hydrophobic particulates<br>
having a melting point of greater than that of the fatty material to give structure and/or conditioning benefits to an aqueous shampoo composition comprising an anionic cleansing surfactant. 20<br>
In a fourth aspect of the invention, there is provided a method of manufacturing an aqueous conditioning shampoo composition comprising the preparation of a gel network<br>
comprising a fatty material selected from C12-C22 fatty<br>
25  alcohol, C12-C22 fatty acid, C12-C22 fatty amide or mixtures<br>
thereof and hydrophobic particulates having a melting point of greater than that of the fatty material, the gel network being subsequently added to an aqueous solution of an anionic cleansing surfactant.<br>
 <br>
- 4 -<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The compositions of the invention are suitable for application to the human hair.  They are typically used as 5  rinse off products, that is to say their application is usually followed by a rinsing stage with water.<br>
The invention uses a gel network as described hereinafter to deliver structure and conditioning benefits to a shampoo 0  composition comprising an anionic cleansing surfactant.  The term "structure", when used in this context, should be understood to mean "thicken", i.e. increase the viscosity thereof.<br>
5  The preferred viscosity for products according to the<br>
invention is from 3000 to 9000 cP (mPa.s), more preferably from 5000 to 7000 cP (mPa.s), and most preferably from 5500 to 6500 cP (mPa.s) at 30Â°C, as measured by a Brookfield viscometer equipped with a RVT pin number 5 at a measuring<br>
0  speed of 20 rpm.<br>
By "aqueous conditioning shampoo composition" is meant a composition which has water or an aqueous solution or a lyotropic liquid crystalline phase as its major component. 5  Typically, the composition will comprise at least 50%,<br>
preferably at least 60%, at most preferably at least 75% by weight of water.<br>
 <br>
- 5 -<br>
Anionic cleansing surfactant<br>
Conditioning shampoo compositions according to the invention comprise one or more anionic cleansing surfactants, which are 5  cosmetically acceptable and suitable for topical application to the hair.<br>
Examples of suitable anionic cleansing surfactants are the alkyl sulphates, alkyl ether sulphates, alkaryl sulphonates,<br>
10  alkanoyl isethionates, alkyl succinates, alkyl<br>
sulphosuccinates, alkyl ether sulphosuccinates, N-alkyl sarcosinates, alkyl phosphates, alkyl ether phosphates, and alkyl ether carboxylic acids and salts thereof, especially their sodium, magnesium, ammonium and mono-, di- and<br>
15  triethanolamine salts.  The alkyl and acyl groups generally contain from 8 to 18, preferably from 10 to 16 carbon atoms and may be unsaturated.  The alkyl ether sulphates, alkyl ether sulphosuccinates, alkyl ether phosphates and alkyl ether carboxylic acids and salts thereof may contain from 1<br>
20  to 20 ethylene oxide or propylene oxide units per molecule.<br>
Typical anionic cleansing surfactants for use in shampoo compositions of the invention include sodium oleyl succinate, ammonium lauryl sulphosuccinate, sodium lauryl sulphate,<br>
25  sodium lauryl ether sulphate, sodium lauryl ether<br>
sulphosuccinate, ammonium lauryl sulphate, ammonium lauryl ether sulphate, sodium dodecylbenzene sulphonate, triethanolamine dodecylbenzene sulphonate, sodium cocoyl isethionate, sodium lauryl isethionate, lauryl ether<br>
30  carboxylic acid and sodium N-lauryl sarcosinate.<br>
 <br>
- 6 -<br>
Preferred anionic cleansing surfactants are sodium lauryl sulphate, sodium lauryl ether sulphate(n)EO, (where n is from 1 to 3), sodium lauryl ether sulphosuccinate(n)EO, {where n is from 1 to 3), ammonium lauryl sulphate, ammonium lauryl 5  ether sulphate(n)EO, (where n is from 1 to 3), sodium cocoyl isethionate and lauryl ether carboxylic acid (n) EO (where n is from 10 to 20) .<br>
Mixtures of any of the foregoing anionic cleansing 10  surfactants may also be suitable.<br>
The total amount of anionic cleansing surfactant preferably ranges from 0.5 to 45%, more preferably from 1 to 30%, and most preferably from 5 to 20% by total weight of the 15  composition.<br>
Gel Network<br>
The gel network is formed by combining the components at a 20  temperature above the melting point of the fatty material in the presence of water.  In a preferred method of manufacture in accordance with the fourth aspect of the invention, the fatty material is melted in water and the particulate material is then added.  In a more preferred method of 25  manufacture, a quaternary ammonium compound is also added, preferably after the particulate material.  A dispersion of liquid crystalline phase droplets is typically produced.  It will be realised that, in effect, the gel network has another component: water.  In preferred embodiments, the gel<br>
30  network comprises an L&amp; lamellar phase dispersion at 25Â°C.<br>
 <br>
_ 7 -<br>
The composition according to the invention can only be formed with a separately made gel network. Mixing the components of the gel network together without premixing and heating does not form a gel network. 5<br>
Fatty material<br>
A fatty material selected from C12-C22, preferably C15-22 fatty alcohol, C3.2-C22, preferably Ci6-22 fatty acid, C12-C22, 10  preferably C15-22 fatty amide or mixtures thereof is an essential component of the gel network.  Preferably, the fatty material comprises a C12-C22 fatty alcohol.  The fatty<br>
alcohol is preferably a primary alcohol.  The fatty alcohol and/or fatty acid and/or amide preferably has a linear (i.e. 15  non-branched) hydrocarbon chain.  Preferably, said chain is saturated.  Preferably, the fatty alcohol and/or fatty acid<br>
and/or fatty amide is C16-C22 anc* more preferably it is Cig-<br>
CIQ.     Most preferably the fatty material is cetyl alcohol<br>
and/or stearyl alcohol. 20<br>
The total amount of fatty material selected from C12-C22<br>
fatty alcohol, C12-C22 fatty acid, or mixtures thereof, is<br>
preferably from 0.01 to 20%, more preferably from 0.1 to 10%, and most preferably from 0.5 to 5% by weight of the 25  total composition.  In preferred embodiments, these<br>
preferred amounts apply to the level of C12-C22 fatty alcohol<br>
in the total composition.<br>
 <br>
- 8 -<br>
Hydrophobic particulates<br>
Hydrophobic particulates having a melting point of greater than that of the fatty material are a second essential 5  component of the gel network.  Preferably, the particulates have a melting point of greater than 150Â°C.  Without wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that such particulates act as templates that help sustain the ordered structure of the gel network within the shampoo composition, despite the 10  presence of anionic surfactant therein.  The particles are believed to enhance the stability and performance of the gel network as a result.<br>
The particulates are solids with a melting point of greater 15  than that of the fatty material referred to above.  This is important for giving stability to the gel network and for enabling its formation, the gel network typically being prepared at elevated temperature.  When the gel network also comprises a quaternary ammonium compound (vide infra),   the 20  particulates also have a melting point higher than this component.<br>
The term ^hydrophobic" should be understood to mean that the particulates lack an  affinity for water; in particular, that<br>
25  they have a solubility in water of less than 0.01 g/1 and that they are  not dispersible in water without continual agitation.  Typically, the hydrophobic particulates partition into n-octanol rather than water, when shaken at 25Â°C in a 1:1 mixture by volume of these liquids; that is to<br>
30  say, the majority (greater than 50%) and more  typically<br>
 <br>
- 9 -<br>
greater than 90% of the particulates partition in this manner.<br>
It is believed that the hydrophobicity of the particulates 5  enhances their interaction with fatty components of the gel network and leads to a more stable gel network and a more stable and effective composition.<br>
Suitable hydrophobic particulates may be inorganic, organic, 10  or of mixed inorganic/organic nature.<br>
Suitable hydrophobic particulates include clays, hydrophobically modified acrylates, zinc pyrithione, hydrophobically modified cellulose, hydrophobically modified<br>
15  silica, hexafluoropropylene/tetrafluoroethylene copolymer, PTFE, styrene/acrylates, nylon, polyurethane, polyvinylchloride, polymethylmethacrylate, aluminium starch octenylsuccinate, acrylates, ammonium acrylates, cellulose, dextran, silica, carbomer, chalk, chitosan, titanium<br>
20  dioxide, titanium hydroxide, alumina and mixtures thereof.<br>
Preferred hydrophobic particulates are hydrophobically-modified natural clays and synthetic clays.  The term clay refers to materials comprising particles having a net 25  electroststatic charge on at least one surface.  The clays<br>
may be anionic or cationic, i.e., they may have a net charge on the surface of the clay that is negative or positive, respectively.<br>
30  Preferred hydrophobically-modified clays are based upon anionic clays, such as smectite clays.<br>
 <br>
- 10 -<br>
Smectite clays are, for example, disclosed in US Patents Nos. 3,862,058, 3,948,790, 3,954,632 and 4,062,647 and in EP-A-299,575 and EP-A-313, 146, all in the name of Procter &amp; Gamble Company. 5<br>
Typical smectite clays include the compounds having the<br>
general formula AI2 (Si205) 2 (OH) 2 -nH20 and the compounds<br>
having the general formula Mg3(Si205)2(OH)2*nH20, and<br>
derivatives thereof, for example in which a proportion of<br>
10  the aluminium ions are replaced with magnesium ions or a proportion of the magnesium ions are replaced with lithium ions and/or some of the hydroxyl ions are replaced by fluoride ions; the derivatives may comprise a further metal ion to balance the overall charge.<br>
15<br>
Specific examples of suitable smectite clays are montmorillonites, volchonskoites, nontronites, saponites, beidelites and sauconites, particularly those having an alkali or alkaline earth metal ion within the crystal<br>
20  lattice structure.  Preferred smectite clays are<br>
montmorillonites, nontronites, saponites, beidelites, sauconites and mixtures thereof.  Particularly preferred are montmorillonites, e.g. bentonites and hectorites, with bentonites being especially preferred.<br>
25<br>
Hydrophobically-modified clays are derivable from clays by modification of the clay with a hydrophobic material. Typically, the modification entails replacing at least a proportion of the inorganic metal ions of the unmodified<br>
30  clay with organic cations.  Preferred organic cations for<br>

Examples of such clays are<br>
TM 20  Tixogel MP 100  and Tixogel MP 100V from Sud Chemie.  Other<br>
similar materials include Quaternium benzalkonium bentonite, Quaternium-18 hectorite, stearalkonium bentonite, stearalkonium hectorite and dihydrogenated tallow benzylmonium hectorite.<br>
25<br>
The hydrophobic particulates having a melting point of greater than that of the fatty material have a particle size such that preferably at least 50% and more preferably at least 80% of them are able to pass through a 90 micron<br>
30  screen, such as an air sieve as commonly used in the art.<br>
 <br>
- 12 -<br>
The total amount of hydrophobic particulates having a melting point of greater than that of the fatty material is preferably from 0.005 to 10%, more preferably from 0.01 to 5%, and most preferably from 0.01 to i% by weight of the 5  total composition.<br>

 <br>
- 13 -<br>
methyl and/or ethyl groups; most preferably they are methyl groups.<br>
Most preferably, the quaternary ammonium compound having at<br>
5  least one carbon chain of length C12-C30 is<br>
cetyltrimethylammonium chloride or benhenyltrimethylammonium chloride.<br>
When present, the total amount of quaternary ammonium<br>
10  compound having at least one carbon chain of length C12-C30<br>
is preferably from 0.005 to 10%, more preferably from 0.01 to 5%, and most preferably from 0.01 to 1% by weight of the total composition.<br>
15  The weight ratio of quaternary ammonium compound having at least one carbon chain of length C12-C30 to the hydrophobic particulates is preferably from 30:1 to 5:1.<br>
The molar ratio of quaternary ammonium compound having at 20  least one carbon chain of length C12-C30 to fatty material<br>

 <br>
- 14 -<br>
Silicone oils<br>
A preferred optional component in conditioning shampoo compositions according to the invention is silicone oil. 5  Silicone oil can enhance the conditioning benefit found with compositions of the invention.<br>
When used, silicone oil is typically present as  emulsified droplets having a mean droplet diameter (03,2) of 4 10  micrometres or less.  Preferably the mean droplet diameter (D3,2) is 1 micrometre or less, more preferably 0.5 micrometre or less, and most preferably 0.25 micrometre or less.<br>
15  A suitable method for measuring the mean droplet diameter<br>
(03,2) is by laser light scattering using an instrument such as a Malvern Mastersizer.<br>
Preferably the silicone oil is non-volatile, meaning that it 20  has a vapour pressure of less than 1000 Pa at 25Â°C.<br>
Suitable silicone oils are polydiorganosiloxanes, in particular polydimethylsiloxanes (dimethicones), polydimethyl siloxanes having hydroxyl end groups 25   (dimethiconols), and amino-functional polydimethylsiloxanes (amodimethicones).<br>
Suitable silicones preferably have a molecular weight of greater than 100,000 and more preferably a molecular weight 30  of greater than 250,000.<br>
 <br>
- 15 -<br>
Suitable silicones preferably have a kinematic viscosity of<br>
2  -1 greater than 50,000 cS (mm .s ) and more preferably a<br>
2  -I kinematic viscosity of greater than 500,000 cS (mm .s ).<br>
Silicone oil kinematic viscosities as referred to in this 5  specification are measured at 25Â°C and can be measured by means of a glass capillary viscometer as set out further in Dow Corning Corporate Test Method CTM004 July 20, 1970.<br>
Suitable silicones for use in compositions of the invention 10  are available as pre-formed silicone emulsions from<br>
suppliers such as Dow Corning and GE Silicones.  The use of such pre-formed silicone emulsions is preferred for ease of processing and control of silicone particle size.  Such preÂ¬formed silicone emulsions will typically additionally 15  comprise a suitable emulsifier, and may be prepared by a chemical emulsification process such as emulsion polymerisation, or by mechanical emulsification using a high shear mixer.  Pre-formed silicone emulsions having a Sauter mean droplet diameter (03,2) of less than 0.15 micrometers 20  are generally termed microemulsions.<br>
Examples of suitable pre-formed silicone emulsions include emulsions DC2-1766, DC2-1784, DC-1785, DC-1786, DC-1788, DC-1310, DC-7123 and microemulsions DC2-1865 and DC2-1870, all 25  available from Dow Corning.  These are all<br>
emulsions/microemulsions of dimethiconol. Also suitable are amodimethicone emulsions such as DC939 (from Dow Corning) and SME253 (from GE Silicones) .<br>
 <br>
- 16 -<br>
Also suitable are silicone emulsions in which certain types of surface active block copolymers of a high molecular weight have been blended with the silicone emulsion droplets, as described for example in WO03/094874. 5<br>
Mixtures of any of the above described silicone emulsions may also be used.<br>
The total amount of silicone oil in compositions of the 10  invention may suitably range from 0.05 to 10%, particularly from 0.2 to 8%, and especially from 0.5 to 5% by weight of the composition.<br>
Hydrocarbon oils and ester oils<br>
15<br>
A further component that may be used in compositions of the invention is a hydrocarbon oil or ester oil. Like silicone oils, these materials may enhance the conditioning benefits found with compositions of the invention.<br>
20<br>
Suitable hydrocarbon oils have at least 12 carbon atoms, and include paraffin oil, mineral oil, saturated and unsaturated dodecane, saturated and unsaturated tridecane, saturated and unsaturated tetradecane, saturated and unsaturated<br>
25  pentadecane, saturated and unsaturated hexadecane, and mixtures thereof.  Branched-chain isomers of these compounds, as well as of higher chain length hydrocarbons, can also be used. Also suitable are polymeric hydrocarbons of C2-6 alkenyl monomers, such as polyisobutylene.<br>
30<br>
 <br>

EXAMPLES<br>
Example 1 as indicated in Table 1 was prepared in the following manner. 5<br>
At least 10% of the water was heated to 65Â°C in a side pot. To this, was added the cetyl alcohol, with high speed stirring.  When all of the cetyl alcohol had melted, the Quaternium-18 Bentonite was added, also with high speed 10  stirring, followed by the cetyltrimethylammonium chloride.<br>
The uniform dispersion obtained, whilst still at 65Â°C, was added to an aqueous solution of the sodium laureth sulphate at ambient temperature.  Moderate speed stirring was employed to achieve a uniform dispersion without causing 15  aeration of the product.  The remaining components were then added with continued moderate speed stirring.<br>
Comparative Example A was prepared by methods known in the art.<br>
