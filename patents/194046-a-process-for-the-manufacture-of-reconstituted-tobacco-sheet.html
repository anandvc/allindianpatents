				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
This invention relates to a process for the manufacture of Reconstituted Tobacco sheet having much reduced percentage of Nicotine, Sugars and Chloride using the paper making process. The Reconstituted Tobacco sheet obtained is in the basic weight range of 30 to 150 grams per square meters, and un-conventional raw materials derived from Jute and/or Bamboo are used in the said process.<br>
Reconstituted Tobacco is a paper like sheet comprised either wholly or principally of Tobacco. Reconstitutton permits the use of Tobacco waste, which is unsuitable as such for use in cigarette blends. The reconstituted tobacco sheet can be used as a filler in cigarette blends. It can also be used as a wrapper for cigars and bidis since it is in a form that can be handled much more easily man irregular natural leaves.<br>
Accordingly, it is a primary object of the invention to provide Reconstituted Tobacco sheet having much reduced percentage of Nicotine, Sugars and Chloride.<br>
ft is a further object of the present invention to provide a Reconstituted Tobacco sheet in the basic weight range of 30 to 150 grams per square meter.<br>
Yet, another object of the present invention is to use un-conventional raw materials derived from Jute and/or Bamboo in the manufacture of Reconstituted Tobacco.<br><br>
In a further embodiment, the present invention provides a process for manufacturing Reconstituted Tobacco sheet having much reduced percentage of Nicotine, Sugar and Chloride using the paper making process and unconventional raw materials specified above, to obtain a Reconstituted Tobacco sheet in the basic weight range of 30 to 150 grams per square meter.<br>
It is known that, Tobacco waste is generated at various stages in Tobacco processing plants. Different terminologies are used to describe the type of waste produced. Given hereinbelow are the various terminologies used to specify the various wastes in the Tobacco Industry.<br><br>
SL-KO.	NAME OF WASTE	STAGS OF WASTE GENERATION<br>
1.	Three-tier Drop outs	Three-tier Sieve<br>
2.	Three-tier Sand	Three-tier Sieve<br>
3.	Cooler Sand	Cooling Cylinder<br>
4.	DRFSand	Centralised DRF<br>
5.	Stem Bits	Stem Sieving<br>
6.	Heavies	Air Classifier<br>
7.	Winnowing*	Cigarette Maker<br>
8	LLS	Lamina Sieve<br>
9.	Sterna	Leaf threshing<br>
The process of the present invention consists of the following:-<br>
i) The cellulosic material is separated from non-cellulosic lignin by using Sodium Hydroxide and Sodium Sulphide as cooking chemicals, while converting Jute fiber and/or Bamboo fiber as paper making raw materials. The cellulosic material (pulp) so obtained can be bleached, if required.<br><br>
ii)       Waste materials produced during Tobacco processing are softened by water at 60° -140° Celsius.<br>
iii) Unbleached/ bleached pulps thus produced from Jute and/or Bamboo are wet mixed in high shear mixer called Pulper along with Tobacco Waste material as such or after water softening. The mixed pulp at 3-4 % consistency (concentration) is then hydrated to a wetness level of 60 to 90° SR (as tested on Schopper Riegter Tester) as per the desired product requirements.<br>
iv) The paper is produced on synthetic or metal wire cloth. The slurry is fed onto mis wire cloth at a consistency of 0.8 to 1.3%. De-watering of the pulp slurry takes place by suction. The wet sheet is pressed and dried to produce paper at 4-6% moisture.<br>
Surface property modifiers such as pick resistance, burn control or other special application chemicals can be applied to the sheets, if so desired<br>
The sheets thus produced are suitable for special applications such as :-<br>
&gt;	Replacement ofTendu leaf used lor wrapping Tobacco in the form of Bidi<br>
&gt;	Wrapping orTobacco in the form of Cigar<br>
&gt;	As cigarette paper<br>
&gt;	As filler in Tobacco blends in the manufacture of cigarettes.<br>
&gt;	As filtration material in cigarette filters.<br>
The following are some examples of the experiments conducted to illustrate the process of the invention and the same is not limited thereto.<br><br>
To develop reconstituted Tobacco in the Laboratory by using papermaking process various combinations of different Components were taken as listed below:-<br>
Unbleached/Bleached Jute and/or Bamboo Pulp      	   0 to 20%<br>
Tobacco Waste		   80 to 100%<br>
CMC (Optional)	.........   2 %<br>
CMC stands for sodium salt of carboxymethy cellulose.<br>
Preparation of various Components for making the Reconstituted Tobacco sheet using the papermakiag process.<br>
Component (A): Unbleached Jute/Bleached Jute<br>
Jute bast fiber is cooked in the rotary digester with NaOH and   Na2S at 150°C<br>
temperature. The cooked pulp is removed from the digester and washed in the breaker<br>
washer. Washed pulp is ready for use.<br>
For bleaching, the pulp is treated with bleaching sequences of CEH to a desired<br>
brightness of 75-80 % Elrepho. The bleached pulp is also ready for use.<br>
Component (B):<br>
Tobacco Wastes were softened by cooking in Laboratory digester at 60° - 140°C with water and filtered. The filtrate can be separately processed to recover Nicotine and other taste and flavour Components, if so desired The solid fraction either beaten or unbeaten is kept for mixing with other Components for Reconstituted Tobacco sheet formation.<br><br>
The ratios of various Tobacco Components used are given in examples of different cooks. Alternatively, tobacco waste can be directly beaten without undergoing digestion process.<br>
Component (C):<br>
Component A + Component B were beaten in a Laboratory valley beater with adequate quantity of water. The slurry is ready for Reconstituted Tobacco sheet formation as such or after mixing with other Components.<br>
The following combinations of different Components were made:-<br>
Experiment No. 001/003	Component B<br>
002/004	Component B + 2% CMC<br>
6	Component C<br>
7	Component C + 2% CMC<br>
8	Component C<br>
9	Component C + 2% CMC<br>
10	Component C + 2% CMC<br><br>
12	Component C<br>
13	Component C<br><br>
The slurry from different preparations was processed in the Laboratory handsheet machine and bandsheets were prepared. The handsheets were evaluated for different physical and chemical properties. Details of experiments 001 to 013 are appended.<br>
BENEFIT OF THIS PROCESS:<br>
1.	The sheets produced by this invention have much simple chemistry as these have much reduced percentage of Nicotine, Sugars and Chloride, Such sheets can be used in Tobacco blends to reduce Nicotine content, as wrapper in bidis, cigars and cigarettes and as filtration material in cigarette filters.<br>
2.	The process can also be successfully carried out on a commercial scale using the standard paper making equipment such as pulps, beaters, disc refiners, standard fourdrinier paper machine etc. This is possible due to adequate tensile strength of the reconstituted Tobacco sheet produced by this process of the present invention<br>
3.	Use of unbleached or bleached Jute or Bamboo pulp in the manufacture of reconstituted Tobacco sheet is unique to mis inventioa<br><br>
