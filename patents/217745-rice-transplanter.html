				<td>Field of the Art<br>
The Present invention relates to a rice transplantor, wherein a vehicle is provided with a transplanting portion comprising seedling racks and rice transplanting pawls for continuously performing rice transplanting work.<br>
Background<br>
In a rice transplanter according to Japanese Publication Number S61-285175 having a structure wherein an engine frame and a body frame are connected to a front side and a rear side of a transmission case, respectively, it is necessary to disconnect the engine frame and the main body frame each time when performing maintenance of the transmission case.<br>
When the main frame is provided with front and rear wheels, an engine, and a driving seat, there are problems that mounting of the engine on a top of the main frame prevents hot air around the engine from being exhausted downward due to blocking by the main frame, leading to low efficiency of engine cooling, and that a vertical mounting dimension between the engine and the main frame is difficult to be reduced, leading to difficulty in reducing the total height of an engine mounting portion. Moreover, it is difficult to reduce engine vibration transmitted to right and left main frames in a torsional direction (around a longitudinal body axis) of the machine due to a limitation of a lateral mounting interval of right and left vibration proof members for supporting the engine, and it is difficult to reduce the weight of the main frames by reducing wall thickness of the main frames.<br>
Since the main frames are provided with dedicated members for supporting spare seedling racks, there are structural and handling problems that make it difficult to simplify components to reduce weight and cost. When transporting the machine on a deck of a truck, necessity for removing an upper portion of a pillar, divided into top and bottom parts, of the seedling racks causes clearance at a joint portion of the pillar of the seedling racks. Since the bottom pillars of the seedling racks are fixed to the main frames, it is necessary to secure a large housing space such as a barn.<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
This present invention relates to a rice transplanter, wherein a pair of right and left main frames (16) constituting a vehicle body is divided into three parts, which conpries pair of right and left front frames (17) supporting an engine (36); a pair of right and left middle frames (18) connected to the pair of right and left front frames (17) ; and a pair of right and left rear frames (19) connected to the pair of middle frames (18), the pair of middle frames supporting a driving seat, the engine (36) is supported by the pair of right and left front frames (17) through a bottom plate (52) that is fixed to a bottom of the engine (36).a pair of right and left front axle cases (38), which extend along a vehicle width direction and are<br>
connected at their inner ends in the vehicle width direction to a transmission case 37), are respectively supported by the pair of middle frames (18),a rear axle case (42) is connected to a gate-shaped frame (20), which is connected to the pair of rear frames (19),the transmission case (37) and the rear axle case (42) are connected through a body case (41), which is positioned between the pair of main frame (16) with respecl to the vehicle width direction and extends along a vehicle longitudinal direction.the engine (36)is provided with an output shaft (58) at a front side of the engine (36), a bearing cylinder (54) fixed to a bottom of the bottom plate (52) a transmission shaft (59) supported by the bearing cylinder in a rotatable manner around its axis, pulleys (55,56) and a belt (57) connecting the output shaft (58) and a front portion of the transmission shaft (59); and a rear portion of the transmission shaft (590 is detachably connected to an input shaft (60) at a front side of the transmission case (37).<br>
Since a cross-sectional area of the front frame 17 is designed to be larger than that of the rear frame 19 and the engine 36 is supported by the front frames 17, the heavy engine 36 can be supported by the front frames 17 and improvement of longitudinal balance with a transplanting portion 3 provided to a rear side of the body results in better stability of the body.<br>
In a rice tansplanter of which the right and left main frames 16 are provided with front and rear wheels 5 and 6, an enginem 36, and a driving seat 7, installation width of the right and left main frames 16 is formed to be larger than the lateral width of an engine 36 in a side view. Therefore, a ventilation space can be secured between the right and left main frames 16 and both sides of the engine 36. Moreover, the engine can be mounted in a low position to easily lower the center of gravity of the body.<br>
Both sides of a frame member 35 on which vibration-proof members 53 for supporting the engine 36 can be installed are fixed to the right and left main frames 16. Therefore, strength of the main frames 16 can be lowered to reduce the weight by reinforcing the aforementioned frame member 35. A highly rigid frame structure can support the engine 36 in a vibration-proof manner. A mounting interval of the right and left vibration-proof members 53 can be enlarged to reduce vibraion, of the engine 36, transmitted in a torsional direction of the machine. Morever, a body structure can be easily simplified, and vibration-proof function of the engine 36 can be easily improved.<br>
Since a transmission case 37 is fixed to the frame member 35, strength of the frame member 35 can be easily secured against vertical vibration of the engine 36. The right and left main frames 16 can be easily connected using the frame member 35, and strength for supporting the engine 36 can be easily improved. Rigidity of the frame member 35 in a torsional direction of the machine can be improved to simplify a structure for supporting the engine 36 and reduce the weight.<br>
The transmission case 37 is fixed to the frame member 35 almost in the middle of a mounting portion of the right and left vibration-proof members 53. Therefore, the strength of the frame member 35 can be secured by fixing the transmission case 37 against a torsional deformation force caused by vibration of the engine 36 in either the right or left direction, and a deformation damage to the frame member 35 can be prevented to improve durability.<br>
In a rice transplanter wherein the main frames 16 are provided with a step 9 through step stays 24 and 25, and the upper portions of the main frames 16 are covered by the step 9, the aforementioned step stays 24 and 25 are provided with a mounting portion of seedling rack pillars 94 are mounted on the step stays 24 and 25. since the step stays 24 and 25, serving as highly rigid members, are commonly used to allow the seedling rack pillars 94 to stand, reduction of the number of parts for mounting the seedling rack pillar 94 to stand, reduction of the number of parts for mounting the seedling rack pillar 94 and reduction of the number of man-hours for assembling enable reduction in weight and manufacturing costs. Moreover, higher strength can be obtained by supporting the load of the spare seedling racks 15 thanks to the high rigidity of the step 9, and the body structure for mounting the spare seedling racks 15 can be simplified.<br>

The front wheels 5 are pressed downward elastically by the suspension springs 87 through the aforementioned drive shaft 78 and the gear case 69. Ground contact pressure of the front wheels 5 is maintained by the aforementioned springs 87. A core shaft 88 having almost the same length as a dimension of the aforementioned spring 87 at maximum compression is inserted into a central portion of the springs 87. The aforementioned springs 87 are fully compressed by the body weight of the vehicle 1. The aforementioned springs closely contact in a normal condition where the four wheels 5 and 6 are in contact with the ground to keep the vehicle height constant. On the other hand, when traveling on uneven ground where three wheels, namely the right and left rear wheels 6 and either right or left front wheel 5, are in contact, the front wheel 5 is lowered by extension of the suspension springs 87 to maintain ground contact pressure of the front wheel 5 to prevent slip.<br>
As shown in figures 23 and 24, a stopper 89 is integrally formed in an internal side of the aforementioned knuckle arm 75. Right and left protusions 90 and 91 for restricting right and left rotation are integrally formed on the front and rear external sides of the aforementioned front cases 68, and the stopper 89 is made in contact with either protrusion 90 or 91 by maximum turning of the steering wheel 8 to restrict directional change of the wheels 5. The stopper 89 is formed so as to be equal to or longer than a range of sliding (suspension stroke) of the gear box 69 and the knuckle arms 75 made by extension and contraction of the suspension springs 87. Thus, the stopper 89 can be in contact with the protrusions 90 and 91 in all ranges where the knuckle arms 75 are slid by the front spring 87.<br>
As clearly shown above, in a rice transplanter wherein the gear box 69 to which the front wheels 5 are installed is provided to a lower portion of the front cases 68 connected to a side of the machine to constitute the front axle case 38 and the aforementioned gear box 69 is provided around the drive shaft 78 serving as a kingpin in rotatable and vertically slidable manners, the suspension spring 87 serving as an elastic member for elastically pressing the aforementioned gear box 69 downward is installed inside the case cover 70 at an upper portion of the front case 68, and another end of the knuckle arm 75 of which one side is fixed to the gear box 69 is supported by the aforementioned case cover 70 in a slidable manner. Upper and lower portions of the aforementioned knuckle arm 75 are firmly supported by a both ends of the supporting structure in order to stably support a sliding connection portion of the front case 68 and the gear box 69 against a deformation force in an inclining or a torsional direction. Thus, the strength necessary for supporting the front wheels 5 is secured without increasing a diameter of, for example, the drive shaft 78 serving as the kingpin in<br>
order to reduce weight of a structure of the front axle case 38 to which the front wheels 5 are installed and to reduce the manufacturing cost. The knuckle arm 75 is provided so as to slide on an external side of the case cover 70 in which the suspension spring 87 is provided in order to arrange the suspension structure in a space saving manner.<br>
The stopper 89 serving as the member for restricting rotation corresponding to, at least, a vertical sliding range of the gear box 69 is provided inside the knuckle arm 75. The aforementioned stopper 89 is arranged in a space saving manner. The stopper 89 is formed by commonly using the knuckle arm 75, the front case 68, or the like in order to reduce the number of components by commonly using the components and in order to easily obtain strength of the stopper 89 necessary for restricting the rotation of the gear box 69 around the drive shaft 78. A downward sliding of the gear box 69 is restricted by making the case cover 70 or the front case 68 in contact with a bottom of the support portion 83 of the knuckle arm 75. Thus, a stopper such as a stop ring conventionally used at the maximum extension of the front case 68 and the gear box 69 can be eliminated, and it is not necessary to specially provide a stopper part for restricting an extending motion of the gear box 69. A support structure for the gear box 69 can be simplified. A stopper structure having an advantage in strength can be obtained by commonly using the highly rigid knuckle arm 75, thereby manufacturing cost is reduced and durability is improved.<br>
In a rice transplanter wherein the front wheels 5 serving as travel wheels are provided to the machine through the suspension springs 87 in a liftable manner, force of the suspension springs 87 is set so that the highest position of the front wheels 5 against the machine corresponds to a normal condition in order to eliminate the problem of a variation in vehicle height depending on load weight of spare seedlings as seen in a structure of the suspension springs 87 wherein the front wheels 5 are supported during elevation of the front wheels. Rice transplanting work is done in a condition that the body is supported almost horizontally in a rice field to maintain high accuracy of rice transplanting. Ground contact pressure of the front wheels 5 is secured by a ground contact action of the suspension springs 87 are provided to an upper portion of the drive shaft 78 for transmitting drive power to the front wheels 5. The bearing 86 and the holder 85 are provided between the aforementioned drive shaft 78 and the suspension springs 87. Thus, a structure for installing the suspension springs 87 can be simplified in comparison with a structure wound and supported around, for example, the drive shaft 78. Deformation or friction of the suspension springs 87 by rotational force of the drive shaft 78 can be prevented. A surface area of the suspension springs 87 supported by the aforementioned holder 85 is made to be larger in order to prevent inclination of the springs 87.<br>
The suspension springs 87 are provided in order to obtain a minimum vehicle height wherein the machine approaches closest to the front wheels 5 by body weight   and to allow the front wheels 5 to be in contact with the ground by<br>
separating the front wheels 5 from the machine. Thus, deformation of the suspension springs 87 by spare seedlings or weight placed at a time of transplanting work can be prevented. Tilting of the body caused by vehicle height changes due to body weight changes can be prevented. Moreover, meandering travel can be prevented by reducing slipping of the front wheels 5 caused by an uneven road surface.<br>
As shown in Figure 22, the output shaft 72 is supported by a bearing 92 at an external side of the output case 67 fixing the front case 68. A boss portion 93 of the bevel gear 79 provided inside the front case 68 is extended in a direction of the output shaft 72. An end surface of the aforementioned boss portion 93 is made in contact with the bearing 92 in order to bear the thrust load of the bevel gear 79 is eliminated to reduce the number of parts. Thu, machining 93 is made in contact with the bearing 92 in order to bear the thrust load of the bevel gear 79. An uppermost portion of the case cover 70 receiving the aforementioned suspension springs 87 is made close to a bottom of the step 9. The support member 70 made of rubber for the step 9 is provided to a head portion of the case cover 70 is constructed so as to be used as mounting member of a step 9. The stays for supporting the step 9 are eliminated to reduce the number of parts. Both the step 9 and the main frame 16 are supported by the front axle case 38 to support the step 9 in a highly rigid manner.<br>
As shown in Figures 14, 15 and 25, the aforementioned spare seedling racks 15 are provided with a seedling rack pillar 94 having a gate-like shape in a side view and a seedling tray 95 of a vertically three stage structure fixed by bolting to the aforementioned pillar 94 in a cantilever manner. A base 96 is fixed to a lower portion of the gate shape of the seedling rack pillar 94. The base 96 is fixed by bolts 97 to external top surfaces of the step stays 24 and 25 provided to external sides of the front frames 17 forming the main frame 16 in a detachable manner. The seedling rack pillars 94 are vertically installed to the step stays 24 and 25 for supporting the step 9 in a removable manner. The right and left spare seedling racks 15 are arranged on external sides of the step 9 at both ends of the bonnet 10. Moreover, spare seedlings taken out of the seedling tray 95 supported by an external side of the seedling rack pillar 94 are supplied to the seedling racks 11.<br>
As clearly shown above, in a rice transplanter wherein the main frame 16 is provided with the step 9 through the step stays 24 and 25, and an upper portion of the main frame 16 is covered by the step 9, mounting portions of the seedling rack pillar 94 of the spare seedling racks 15 for carrying spare seedlings for supply is provided to the aforementioned step stays 24 and 25 serving as highly rigid members. The number of parts for installing the seedling rack pillars 94 and assembly man-hours are minimized to reduce weight and manufacturing costs. A load of the spare seedling racks 15 is supported by the rigidity of a step 9 with an advantage of high strength in order to simplify the machine structure on which the spare seedling racks 15 are mounted.<br>
As shown in Figure 26, a standing plane 98 and a laying plane 99 are formed in the aforementioned base 96. The standing plane 98 is made in contact with tops of the step stays 24 and 25 to fix the base 96 with the bolts 97. The seedling rack pillar 94 is arranged almost vertically, and the seedling tray is installed to enable rice transplanting work. The laying plane 99 is made in contact with the tops of the step stays 24 and 25 to fix the base 96 by the bolts 97. The seedling rack pillar 94 is fixed by inclining in a direction toward the bonnet 10. Thus, total height of the body is lowered to enable transport of the machine bya truck having two, namely upper and lower, decks or to enable the accommodation of the machine in a small barn.<br>
