				<td>APPARATUS ]FOR ]]FORMING ]]CONTAINERS<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to an apparatus for forming containers<br>
fed with their side walls arranged in a flattened tubular configuration.<br>
Background Art<br>
In the field of the packaging of consumer products of various kinds<br>
there is an increasing use of substantially box-like containers made of a<br>
lightweight material such as cardboard or synthetic material, specifically<br>
suitable to protect the product and to give it specific aesthetic and consumer<br>
presentation qualities.<br>
Packaging occurs, preferably in an automated manner, on machines<br>
that insert the product in a respective container that is provided<br>
appropriately. The containers are usually stored, for example in a stack, so<br>
that their side walls are arranged in a substantially flattened tubular<br>
configuration, so as to achieve minimum space occupation.<br>
In order to perform automated insertion of the products in the<br>
respective containers taken in succession from the magazine, each container<br>
must be opened out, i.e. its side walls must be appropriately spaced apart<br>
and lifted. Opening is generally performed by inserting an appropriately<br>
provided element between the walls of the container so as to lift them at a<br>
preset angle; the open containers must then be conveyed to a product<br>
insertion station.<br>
Currently, the containers, after being opened, are gripped by an<br>
appropriately provided transfer device equipped with supporting elements<br>
that are arranged so as to form a sort of comb, and are stored in respective<br>
receptacles provided on a conveyance line, for example of the chain type,<br>
that is suitable to convey the open containers to the next treatment station.<br>
The transfer device described above is not free from drawbacks.<br><br>
It has in fact considerable limitations, the foremost being linked to the<br>
quality level of the formed containers: a considerable percentage of the open<br>
containers is in fact often affected by surface damage, mainly due to the fact<br>
that the containers, in order to be inserted in the respective receptacles, are<br>
subjected to a certain forcing: this can also cause incorrect positioning of<br>
the containers in the receptacles, with consequent jamming and halting of<br>
the production line.<br>
Secondly, ]]the ]]device ]]for ]]transferring ]]the ]]open ]]containers ]]is<br>
characterized by production rates that can be increased in order to meet the<br>
ever increasing demand for higher efficiency of the machine.<br>
Disclosure of the Invention<br>
The aim of the present invention is to obviate the above-cited<br>
drawbacks, by providing an apparatus that allows to open containers with<br>
side walls arranged in a flattened tubular configuration and to deposit them<br>
effectively on a conveyance line without causing damage to them by<br>
forcing.<br>
Within this aim, an object of the present invention is to provide an<br>
apparatus that has no functional limitations and hindrances, such as for<br>
example incorrect placement or jamming of the containers in the respective<br>
receptacles of the conveyance line.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide an apparatus that<br>
is suitable to operate efficiently at high production rates.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide an apparatus that<br>
is simple, relatively easy to provide in practice, safe in use, effective in<br>
operation, and has a relatively low cost.<br>
This aim and these and other objects that will become better apparent<br>
hereinafter are achieved by an apparatus for forming containers fed with<br>
their side walls arranged in a flattened tubular configuration, characterized<br>
in that it comprises a device for opening the containers that is associated<br>
with means for the abutment and retention of the containers in the open<br><br>
configuration and with means for transferring the open containers into<br>
respective variable-geometry receptacles of a conveyance line, said<br>
receptacles being suitable to move from a first open configuration for<br>
receiving the containers to a second closed configuration for conveying the<br>
containers to a subsequent treatment station.<br>
Brief Description of the Drawings<br>
Further characteristics and advantages of the present invention will<br>
become better apparent from the following detailed description of a<br>
preferred but not exclusive embodiment of an apparatus for forming<br>
containers fed with their side walls arranged in a flattened tubular<br>
configuration according to the invention, illustrated by way of non-limiting<br>

Figure 4.<br>
Ways of carrying out the Invention<br>
In the embodiments that follow, individual characteristics, given in<br>
relation to specific examples, may actually be interchanged with other<br>
different characteristics that exist in other embodiments.<br>
With reference to Figures 1 and 2, the reference numeral 1 generally<br>
designates an apparatus according to the invention for forming containers 2<br>
fed with their side walls arranged in a flattened tubular configuration.<br>
The containers 2 are of the type with a substantially box-like<br>
configuration, formed by side walls 3, 4, 5, 6; the containers are made of a<br><br>
material such as cardboard or synthetic material.<br>
The apparatus is generally inserted in a line for packaging consumer<br>
products in the containers 2; such products can be of various kinds and can<br>
have the most disparate formats. Upstream of the apparatus a sort of<br>
magazine 7 is provided, in which the containers 2 are packed or stacked one<br>
on top of the other in a substantially flattened tubular configuration.<br>
The apparatus comprises, according to the invention, an opening<br>
device 8 that is suitable to make each one of the containers 2 assume the<br>
unfolded tubular configuration that is ideal for inserting products of various<br>
kinds therein; the opening device 8 leads to a line 9 for conveying the open<br>
containers, by means of which the containers are conveyed in succession<br>
preferably toward a successive operating station, such as for example a<br>
product insertion station. The opening device S is associated with means 10<br>
for the abutment and stable retention of the containers in the open<br>
configuration; such means 10 are suitable to prevent the containers from<br>
collapsing spontaneously and resuming the flattened configuration; the<br>
device 8 is further associated with means 11 for transferring the open<br>
containers 2 in respective variable-geometry receptacles 12 provided along<br>
the conveyance line 9.<br>
Each one of the receptacles 12 is suitable to move from a first open<br>
configuration for receiving the unfolded containers to a second closed<br>
configuration for conveying the containers along the line 9 toward a<br>
subsequent treatment station.<br>
The magazine 7 of the containers 2 in the flattened configuration is<br>
substantially shaped like a hopper, which is inclined by a suitable angle with<br>
respect to the vertical, and comprises a support 13 that is rigidly coupled to<br>
the footing of the apparatus and to which side walls 14 are fixed; such side<br>
walls 14 are mutually opposite in pairs and form a sort of channel for the<br>
descent of the containers that leads to an outlet 15. Elements 16 for<br>
selectively stopping the containers 2 are provided in association with the<br><br>
outlet 15 and allow to extract in succession the container that occupies the<br>
lowest position in the stack while retaining the overlying ones.<br>
An element 17 for removing the containers 2 in the flattened<br>
configuration is located at the outlet 15 of the magazine 7: it is constituted<br>
for example by an arm 18 that is provided with one or more pairs of suckers<br>
19 and is adjustably fixed on a motorized rotating support 20 that is suitable<br>
to produce a reciprocating motion characterized by a preset angular stroke.<br>
The arm 18 is actuated so as to rotate between an upper angular position, in<br>
which the suckers 19 adhere to the container 2 that occupies the lowest<br>
position of the stack, and a lower angular position, in which the arm 18 is<br>
arranged below a surface n for the deposition and advancement of the<br>
containers 2 that is formed by parallel sides 21: two rollers 22, in mutual<br>
contact along a generatrix at the surface n, allow to print on the side walls<br>
3, 4, 5, 6 of the containers.<br>
The parallel sides 21 determine the container feed direction, which in<br>
the specific case is slightly inclined with respect to the horizontal. The<br>
parallel sides 21 are associated with a pusher 23 for pushing the containers 2<br>
in the feed direction, i.e.. toward the opening device 8. The pusher 23 is<br>
preferably constituted by a rack that meshes with an actuation pinion 24; the<br>
pusher 23 has, at its front end, an extension 25 that is substantially fork-<br>
shaped and is suitable to produce the translational motion of each container<br>
2 arranged on the advancement surface II in the feed direction of the<br>
opening device 8.<br>
The opening device 8 comprises a laminar element 26 that is suitable<br>
to penetrate between the side walls 3, 4, 5, 6 of each container 2 in the<br>
flattened configuration so as to raise the walls 3, 4, 5 in order to arrange<br>
them in the open configuration; the laminar element 26 is associated with<br>
means 27 for translational motion in a direction that is substantially<br>
perpendicular to the advancement direction of the containers 2. The<br>
translational motion means 27 comprise two parallel cylindrical rods 28<br><br>
whose axes are perpendicular to the advancement direction of the containers<br>
2; a slider 29 is coupled so that it can slide along said rods, is provided with<br>
two circular holes 30 for engaging the rods 28, and is associated with a lever<br>
system 31; a bracket 32 is fixed to the slider 29, preferably by means of a<br>
side-fit coupling, and the laminar element 26 in turn is connected to said<br>
bracket for example by means of screws and in an adjustable manner.<br>
The laminar element 26 in this manner can be actuated so as to<br>
perform a translational motion that is parallel to the rods 28 and therefore at<br>
right angles to the advancement direction of the containers 2 from a<br>
retracted position to an extended position for insertion between the side<br>
walls 3, 4, 5, 6 of the container 2 in the flattened tubular configuration.<br>
The laminar element 26 is constituted by a lower plate 33 and by an<br>
upper plate 34, which are thin and are mutually pivoted about an actuation<br>
shaft 35 on which a gear 36 is keyed; such gear meshes with a toothed<br>
sector 37, which is associated with motion transmission means, which are<br>
not shown in the figures since they are fully intuitive.<br>
Preferably, the lower plate 33 has a longitudinally elongated shape<br>
and its front side 33 is beveled and slightly inclined so as to facilitate the<br>
insertion of the laminar element 26 in the containers 2 in the flattened<br>
configuration.<br>
In its translational motion at right angles to the advancement direction<br>
of the containers 2, the lower plate 33 of the laminar element 26 lies<br>
substantially on the advancement surface II of the containers; the upper<br>
plate 34 is actuated by the shaft 35 so as to rotate, in the extended position<br>
of the laminar element 26, from an angular position for insertion in the<br>
container 2, in which it is substantially superimposed on the lower plate 33,<br>
to an angular position that is inclined with respect to said lower plate. The<br>
rotation of the upper plate 34 with respect to the lower plate 33 allows to lift<br>
the side walls 3, 4, 5 of the container at a preset angle in the open<br>
configuration.<br><br>
The conveyance line 9 is preferably constituted by two parallel chains<br>
39 that are closed in a loop and wind around respective pairs of coaxial<br>
actuation and guiding wheels 40, so that each one forms, in its own motion,<br>
an upper portion 41 ]and a lower portion 42 spaced by a substantially<br>
circular arc-like portion 43. Along the chains 39 a distribution of pairs of<br>
tooth-shaped partitions 44 that are mutually opposite in pairs is provided;<br>
adjacent and opposite pairs of partitions 44 form the variable geometry-<br>
receptacles 12 for the open containers 2. In the motion of each chain 39<br>
about the respective wheel 40, the curvature of the circular arc-like portion<br>
43 produces the transition of the receptacles 12 formed by the partitions 44<br>
from the first open configuration (in which the partitions 44 are mutually<br>
divaricated and diverge), which is suitable to receive the open containers, to<br>
a second closed configuration (in which the partitions 44 are substantially<br>
parallel), in which the containers 2 are firmly retained along the walls 3, 5<br>
and conveyed to a subsequent station. Each one of the partitions 44 has a<br>
lower portion that forms on one side a protrusion 45 for abutment and fixing<br>
on the respective chain 39 and, on the other side, a sort of tooth 46 that<br>
forms a flat contact surface for the lower side wall 6 of the open container 2.<br>
One of the pairs of wheels 40 around which the chains 39 wind is<br>
supported so that it can rotate in the footing of the apparatus proximate to<br>
the opening device 8, the abutment and retention means 10, and the means<br>
11 for transferring the containers 2. In particular, the axis of the pairs of<br>
wheels 40 is arranged substantially below the pivoting axis of the lower<br>
plate 33 and the upper plate 34 of the laminar element 26.<br>
The conveyance line 9 is associated with at least one pair of elongated<br>
strips 47 for providing upper contrast to the motion of the open containers 2.<br>
A contoured plate 48 that is rigidly coupled to the footing of the apparatus<br>
forms a sleeve 49 in an upper region and a straight guide 50 in a lower<br>
region. An actuation axis 51 is rotatably supported within the sleeve 49 and<br>
has a free end at which two bars 53 are keyed in respective end portions<br><br>
(and locked by means of a cylindrical clamp 52); such bars are<br>
perpendicular to the axis, are connected by a reinforcement cross-member<br>
54, and are articulated at their opposite ends to rods 55 that are rigidly<br>
coupled respectively with the two upper contrast strips 47. The manual<br>
rotation of the bars 53 during the fine-tuning of the apparatus allows to raise<br>
and lower the contrast strips 47 in order to perform suitable adjustments<br>
correlated to the size variations of the containers 2 or in order to perform<br>
maintenance (for example in case of jamming due to a container positioned<br>
improperly in the respective receptacle 12, or for other causes of incorrect<br>
operation).<br>
The means 10 for the abutment and retention of the containers 2 are<br>
constituted by at least one oscillating element 56, which is arranged<br>
substantially above the opening device 8 and in particular above the laminar<br>
element 26. The oscillating element 56 can move from an upper position, in<br>
which it is raised in order to allow the rotation of the upper plate 34 of the<br>
laminar element 26 together with the side walls 3, 4, 5 of the container 2, to<br>
a lower position, in which it is substantially engaged on the upper side wall<br>
4: in this manner, when the laminar element 26 is in the retracted position,<br>
spontaneous reclosure of the side walls 3, 4, 5 of the container is prevented,<br>
and the container is retained, together with the transfer means 11, in the<br>
squared configuration in order to be then transferred onto the conveyance<br>
line 9.<br>
The oscillating element 56 has an elongated parallelepipedal<br>
configuration, with beveled front and rear edges, is arranged substantially<br>
parallel to the advancement surface II of the containers 2, and is connected<br>
to fixed portions of the apparatus: advantageously, two parallel oscillating<br>
elements 56 are provided that are connected, by means of respective pairs of<br>
articulated rockers 57, at their respective ends, to the upper contrast strips<br>
47 of the conveyance line 9, in which suitable contoured recesses 58 are<br>
provided for this purpose: in this manner, it is possible to provide a sort of<br><br>
articulated parallelogram. Each one of the two oscillating elements 56 is<br>
suitable to abut respectively at the ends of the upper side wall 4 of each<br>
container, so as to distribute and balance the retaining action applied<br>
thereto. Stable grip of each oscillating element 56 on the container 2 is<br>
achieved by providing elastic means 59 that are interposed between the<br>
element 56 and the respective upper contrast strip 47.<br>
The elastic means 59 are preferably constituted by a helical<br>
cylindrical spring, in which a first end is inserted in abutment within a seat<br>
60 that is provided in the strip and a second end abuts within a dead hole 61<br>
provided in the upper face of the oscillating element 56.<br>
The means 11 for transferring the open containers 2, which cooperate<br>
with the abutment and retention means 10 in retaining the containers,<br>
comprise a carriage 62 that is engaged so that it can slide, with its upper<br>
portion 63, along the guide 50 provided at the base of the plate 48; the<br>
carriage 62 is actuated so as to perform a reciprocating translational motion<br>
along the guide 50 by a crank system 64 that is controlled by elements of a<br>
known kind, which are not shown in the drawings. The carriage 62 is<br>
provided with two appendages 65 that extend downward and are inclined by<br>
a preset angle with respect to the advancement surface II of the containers<br>
2. Preferably, the appendages 65 are connected, so that they are adjustable<br>
by means of screws, to an elongated support 66, which in turn is fixed to the<br>
carriage 62 by means of an additional screw 67.<br>
The crank system 64 for actuating the carriage 62 comprises a crank<br>
68 that is keyed to the axis 51, which is turned with an alternating rotary<br>
motion about its own axis; at its free end, the crank 68 is articulated to the<br>
first end of a traction element 69 that has an adjustable center distance and<br>
in which the second end is pivoted to a side of the carriage 62. The carriage<br>
62, driven by the crank 68, performs an advancement stroke, in which it<br>
pushes the unfolded container 2 into a receptacle 12 in the open<br>
configuration, and a retraction stroke, in order to reposition itself at the<br><br>
laminar element 26 in order to perform the subsequent opening operation.<br>
The inclination at a preset and appropriate angle given to the appendages 65<br>
of the carriage 62 with respect to the advancement surface II of the<br>
containers 2 allows, during the opening of said containers, to provide a rear<br>
abutment of the side wall 5 of the container raised by the upper strip 34 of<br>
the laminar element 26 and, once opening is complete, allows to push the<br>
unfolded container 2, kept in the correct configuration by the oscillating<br>
element 56, into a receptacle 12 in the open configuration.<br>
The operation of the apparatus according to the invention is as<br>
follows.<br>
The containers 2, in the flattened tubular configuration, are taken<br>
from the magazine 7 and are made to advance in succession by the action of<br>
the pusher 23, which is controlled by the motion of the corresponding<br>
toothed pinion 37. Each container 2 therefore arrives at the opening device<br>
8: the advancement of the slider 29 along the rods 28 allows the<br>
translational motion, at right angles to the container advancement direction,<br>
of the laminar element 26, which is inserted fully between the side walls 3,<br>
4, 5, 6 of the container to be opened. At this point, the actuated rotation of<br>
the toothed sector 37, transmitted to the gear 36. allows to achieve a<br>
consequent rotation of the shaft 33. This produces the rotation, through a<br>
preset angle, of the upper strip 34, accordingly lifting the side walls 3, 4, 5<br>
of the container, which assume the open configuration (in Figure 2,<br>
discontinuous lines illustrate successive configurations of the container<br>
during opening, and the appendages 65 are shown in their rear stroke limit<br>
position).<br>
The lifting of the side walls 3, 4, 5 of the container causes by<br>
interference a substantially upward action, in particular of the walls 4 and 5,<br>
on the oscillating elements 56, which are initially in the lower position and<br>
rise elastically into the upper position, contrasted by the respective helical<br>
springs 59. The appropriate choice of the rotation angle of the upper strip 34<br><br>
of the laminar element 26 allows to raise the side walls 3, 4, 5 of the<br>
container until an unfolded configuration is achieved which, thanks to the<br>
higher elastic action applied by the oscillating elements 56 and of the rear<br>
abutment of the appendages 65 of the carnage 62, is substantially stable<br>
(once the laminar element 26 has been extracted by reverse motion of the<br>
slider 29), since the container 2 is prevented from collapsing.<br>
The carriage 62 at this point is moved by the crank system 64 so as to<br>
perform a translational motion toward the conveyance line 9, so as to push<br>
the squared container 2 into a respective receptacle 12, sliding with the<br>
upper side wall 4 along the oscillating elements 56.<br>
The partitions 44 of the conveyance line 9, by passing over the<br>
actuation wheels 40 of the chain 39 (at the circular arc-like portion 43),<br>
initially undergo a mutually divaricating motion that opens the receptacle<br>
12, which accordingly assumes the first open configuration for receiving the<br>
containers, which is followed by a mutual relative approach motion that<br>
causes their reclosure in the second configuration for conveyance of the<br>
containers 2. Such approach motion, appropriately in step with the<br>
advancement stroke of the carriage 62, allows the open container 2 to<br>
penetrate between the partitions 44 and rest with the lower side wall 6 on<br>
the teeth 46; the reclosure of the partitions 44 in the second configuration<br>
accordingly produces the stable and safe retention of the unfolded container<br>
2 and its conveyance toward a subsequent treatment station.<br>
It has thus been shown that the invention achieves the intended aim<br>
and objects.<br>
The invention thus conceived is susceptible of numerous<br>
modifications and variations, all of which are within the scope of the<br>
appended claims. In particular, it is noted that the apparatus can be used<br>
effectively to form containers of any shape or size.<br>
In an alternative embodiment of the apparatus according to the<br>
invention, shown in Figures 4 and 5 (in which the elements that have<br><br>
already ]been ]described ]have ]been ]designated ]by ]the ]same ]reference<br>
numerals), the oscillating element 56 is rigidly coupled to the means 11 for<br>
transferring ]the ]containers ]in ]the ]open ]configuration. ]The ]oscillating<br>
element 56 is rigidly connected, for example by means of a clamp 70 locked<br>
by a screw 71, to a central shaft 72 that is supported so that it can rotate<br>
substantially at the center of the side of the carriage 62: the shaft 72 is<br>
actuated so as to rotate with a reciprocating motion about its own axis in<br>
step with the translational and rotational motion of the laminar element 26,<br>
so as to move the oscillating element 56 from a lower angular position to an<br>
upper angular position during the upward motion of the side walls 3, 4, 5 of<br>
the container 2 in order to prevent unwanted and damaging interference<br>
contacts, and then from, the upper angular position to the lower angular<br>
position in order to retain the container in the open configuration.<br>
The oscillating element 56 is substantially L-shaped and is constituted<br>
by a first segment 73, which is coupled adjustably (according to the<br>
dimensions of the containers) to the clamp 70 that is keyed to the shaft 72,<br>
and by a second segment 74, which is perpendicular to the first segment 73<br>
and is provided at its free end with a contoured tooth 75 that is fixed by<br>
means of a screw 76. The contoured tooth 75 has a recess 77 whose<br>
geometry is complementary to the edge formed by the side walls 3 and 4 of<br>
the container, so as to constitute an effective abutment against the<br>
spontaneous reclosure of the walls and so as to retain the container 2 in<br>
cooperation with the appendages 65 of the carriage after the exit of the<br>
laminar element 26.<br>
The abutment and retention means 10 and the transfer means 11<br>
associated with the opening device 8 allow to deposit the unfolded<br>
containers 2 on the conveyance line 9 without causing damage due to<br>
forcing during the insertion of the containers in the receptacles 12; the<br>
apparatus is further capable of operating at high production rates and<br>
efficiently, simply and without drawbacks of various kinds.<br><br>
All the details may be replaced with other technically equivalent ones.<br>
