				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a process<br>
for the controlled oxidation of electron-depleted<br>
substrates, in the presence of. a catalyst whose active<br>
phase is obtained from one or more heteropolyacids. It<br>
more particularly concerns the controlled oxidation of<br>
a substrate having a methylene to which an electronwithdrawing<br>
group or functional group is attached/<br>
The present invention furthermore relates to<br>
a composition obtained from certain specific<br>
heteropolyacids and titanium dioxide as a support, as<br>
well as to a catalyst comprising the said composition<br>
as its active phase.<br>
By convention, the term heteropolyacid (or<br>
HPA) will be used in this text to denote compounds<br>
corresponding to the Keggin structure, both<br>
heteropolyacids and polyoxometallates.<br>
In this field, as regards the nature of the<br>
Keggin structure, reference may be made to two articles<br>
published in "the catalyst review newsletter"; the one<br>
published in October 1993 concerning "solid acid '93<br>
meeting, Houston Texas" on page 9, and the one in<br>
volume 4 No. 7 on page 12.<br>
Obtaining a carbon-oxygen bond, in particular<br>
a single one, from a &gt;CH- unit (in general methyl) of<br>
which at least one of the bonds is linked to an<br>
electron-withdrawing group, by controlled oxidation of<br>
the said unit, has the advantage of using a raw<br>
material whose cost is very competitive compared to<br>
those employed in existing technologies. However, to<br>
the knowledge of the Applicant Company, no process of<br>
this type has been described to date.<br>
A process of this type would be of particular<br>
interest for synthesizing carbon derivatives which<br>
contain both oxygen and halogens, above all fluorine.<br>
As an example of the problem to be solved, mention may<br>
be made of the cases in which the electron-withdrawing<br>
group or groups are selected from fluorine atoms and<br>
radicals whose attachment carbon tthat is to say the<br>
one linked to the said &gt;CH-) is monofluorinated, and<br>
advantageously difluorinated. As electron-withdrawing<br>
group, particular mention should be made of<br>
perfluoroalcoyls and, in particular, trifluoromethyl.<br>
This is why one of the objects of the present<br>
invention is to provide a controlled oxidation process<br>
which makes it possible to treat electron-depleted<br>
substrates.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to<br>
provide a process of the above type which makes it<br>
possible to form one or more carbon-oxygen bonds.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to<br>
provide a process of the above type which makes it<br>
possible to form one or more ether, ester and/or acid<br>
f \inc t i ona 1 group s .<br>
Another object of the present invention is to<br>
provide a process of the above type which makes it<br>
possible to form one or more ether, ester and/or acid<br>
functional groups from a methylated perfluoroalkane,<br>
and in particular 1,1,1-trifluoroethane.<br>
These objects, and others which will become<br>
apparent below, are achieved by means of a process for<br>
the controlled oxidation of a substituted hydrocarbon<br>
substrate, in which the said substituted hydrocarbon<br>
substrate is brought into contact with an oxygen source<br>
in the presence of at least one catalyst selected from<br>
those whose active phase is obtained from a<br>
heteropolyacid of formula (I): Hf [CcDdEeOj in which:<br>
C represents Mo and/or W;<br>
D represents phosphorus, arsenic, antimony,<br>
silicon, germanium and/or boron;<br>
E represents an element selected from vanadium<br>
optionally in combination with at least one metal<br>
from groups VA, VIIA, VIII or chromium;<br>
it being possible for the said acid to be partially or<br>
even completely neutralized by a cationic entity of<br>
formula (II) [AaBb] substituting for HÂ£:<br>
x being the number of oxygens needed to accommodate the<br>
highest valencies of C, D and E;<br>
from hydrogen, an alkali metal, or an ammonium or<br>
phosphonium ion;<br>
B represents VO2+, VO3+, an ion of an alkaline-earth<br>
metal or of a metal from groups VII A, VIII, IB, IV B<br>
and V B of the periodic table;<br>
= a + ab with a being the charge of the ion B, i.e.<br>
equal to 2, 3 or 4;<br>
c varies between 5 and 20-e inclusive;<br>
d varies between 1 and 5 inclusive;<br>
e varies between 1 and 9 inclusive;<br>
and in that the said substrate has a (&gt;CH-) unit,<br>
advantageously methylene (CH2) , to which at least one<br>
electron-withdrawing group (or atom) is attached,<br>
f/d is on one hand at least equal to 1 and on the other hand<br>
at most equal to 12, advantageously to 8, preferably to 8.<br>
x is equal to (f+cy+d6+ee)/2 where the greek letters<br>
represent the highest valence of the elements represented by<br>
the corresponding capital latin letters.<br>
Here, and throughout the description, the<br>
references made to the periodic table of the elements<br>
pertain to the one published in the supplement to the<br>
Bulletin de la Socigte Chimique de France (No. I -<br>
January 1966).<br>
The invention also relates to a composition<br>
obtained from titanium dioxide as the support and a<br>
heteropolyacid of formula (I).<br>
In what follows, the terms titanium dioxide and<br>
titanium oxide have the same meaning.<br>
Thus, the process according to the invention<br>
consists in employing a catalyst whose active phase is<br>
obtained from a heteropolyacid of the aforementioned formula<br>
(I) .<br>
More particularly, the element B is selected from<br>
the ions VO2+, VO3+, Cu2+, Fe3+, Co2+, Ag+, Ni2+, Mn2+, Mg2+, <br>
The element B is advantageously selected from the<br>
ions V02+ and V03+ ; preferably the ion V02+.<br>
As regards the element E, if other than vanadium,<br>
it is more particularly selected from chromium, manganese,<br>
iron, cobalt and nickel.<br>
According to a preferred variant of the<br>
invention, the heteropolyacid involved in the preparation of<br>
the active phase corresponds to the formula (I) in which D<br>
is phosphorus, E is vanadium, d is equal to 1, c is between<br>
1 and 3 and the sum of c + e is equal to 12.<br>
According to a particular embodiment, the<br>
catalyst which is employed has an active phase that<br>
furthermore comprises a support.<br>
By way of a support which is suitable for this<br>
particular embodiment, mention may for example be made of<br>
the dioxides of titanium, silicon, zirconium, cerium, tin,<br>
alumina and silica-alumina, it being possible for these<br>
made of the dioxides of titanium, silicon, zirconium,<br>
cerium, tin, alumina and silica-alumina, it being<br>
possible for these compounds to be used individually or<br>
as a mixture.<br>
The support is preferably selected from the<br>
dioxides of titanium or zirconium, the former being<br>
preferred.<br>
According to a variant of this embodiment,<br>
the active phase of the catalyst has an atomic ratio,<br>
(C + E)/metallic element of the support, of between 0.1<br>
and 30%. The term metallic element of the support is<br>
intended to mean titanium, zirconium, cerium, etc.<br>
The aforementioned atomic ratio is preferably<br>
between 5 and 20%.<br>
In the case when the active phase comprises a<br>
support, the distribution between the two constituents<br>
of the active phase is such that the heteropolyacid of<br>
formula (I) is more particularly dispersed at the<br>
surface of the said support.<br>
According to a first embodiment, the catalyst<br>
is employed in bulk form, that is to say a catalyst<br>
comprising only the active phase obtained from the<br>
heteropolyacid and, where applicable, the support.<br>
According to a second embodiment, the<br>
catalyst is employed in dilute form, that is to say the<br>
aforementioned active phase is mixed with an inert<br>
material.<br>
In the latter case, the active phase may<br>
either be deposited on the inert material, or coated or<br>
else mixed with it.<br>
By way of materials which may be used as<br>
inert materials, mention may be made of: sintered clay,<br>
magnesia, magnesium silicate, diatomaceous earth. These<br>
types of inert materials may be used in porous or nonporous<br>
form. The respective inert material is<br>
preferably used in non-porous form. If necessary, it<br>
may be enamelled to render it non-porous.<br>
Ceramic materials, such as cordierite,<br>
mullite, porcelain, nitrides of silicon and of boron,<br>
and silicon carbide may also be used as the inert<br>
material.<br>
The catalyst employed in the process<br>
according to the invention, which may or may not be<br>
diluted, is in the form of particles or a monolith.<br>
If the catalyst consists of particles, their<br>
size will depend on the way in which the catalyst is<br>
used. It can therefore vary in wide limits, in<br>
particular between a few micrometres and about ten<br>
millimetres. More particularly, by way of indication, a<br>
catalyst used as a fixed bed has a particle size<br>
distribution of generally between 0.5 and 6 mm. The<br>
size of the particles of a catalyst used as a fluidized<br>
or mobile bed is usually between 5 and 700 microns, and<br>
preferably between 5 and 200 microns for 80% of the<br>
particles.<br>
If the catalyst consists of particles, any<br>
shape will be suitable for implementing the invention.<br>
Thus, the catalyst may for example be in the form of<br>
balls or rings. The term rings is used to denote hollow<br>
objects whose cross-section is circular,<br>
parallelepipedal, ellipsoidal or the like. Any other<br>
type of complex structure may likewise be envisaged,<br>
for example one obtained by extruding the inert<br>
material (cross, star, etc.).<br>
In the conventional way, the quantity of<br>
inert material involved in the composition of the<br>
catalyst varies in wide limits, most of the time<br>
depending on the way in which the catalyst is formed.<br>
Thus, catalysts obtained by coating or<br>
depositing the active phase on the inert material have<br>
a quantity of active phase which usually varies between<br>
0.1 and 30%, and preferably between 2 and 20% of the<br>
total weight of catalyst (active phase + inert<br>
material).<br>
In the cases when the catalyst comprises the<br>
active phase dispersed in an inert material, the<br>
quantity of active phase is between 1 and 90% of the<br>
total weight of catalyst.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the<br>
invention, the active phase of the catalyst coats the<br>
inert material which is present.<br>
The catalyst may be prepared using any simple<br>
and reproducible conventional technique, and this<br>
constitutes an additional advantage of the invention.<br>
Heteropolyacids are known compounds, and the<br>
person skilled in the art may refer to the relevant<br>
publications in order to prepare them.<br>
As more particularly concerns<br>
heteropolyacids, that is to say compounds for which A<br>
represents a hydrogen atom, two types of process may in<br>
particular be employed.<br>
According to a first method, more<br>
particularly suitable for the preparation of<br>
heteropolyacids in which b is equal to 0 and d is equal<br>
to 1, a mixture comprising the constituent elements of<br>
the heteropolyacid, preferably in the form of oxides,<br>
is refluxed in water for 24 h.<br>
Another method of obtaining the<br>
heteropolyacids of the same type as above, for which<br>
the value c is between 6 and 12, consists in preparing<br>
a solution of the constituent elements of the HPA,<br>
which are present in the form of alkali or alkalineearth<br>
metal salts. This solution is obtained by<br>
dissolving the said compounds in water.<br>
Once the solution has been obtained, it is<br>
neutralized by adding an inorganic acid such as, in<br>
particular, hydrochloric acid. The resulting product is<br>
extracted from the medium with ether, then brought into<br>
contact with distilled water in order to obtain an<br>
aqueous solution, from which the heteropolyacid can be<br>
crystallized.<br>
After each of these two methods, it is<br>
possible to obtain the desired heteropolyacid by<br>
evaporation or crystallization. This heteropolyacid may<br>
be used directly as a catalyst in the reaction<br>
according to the invention, optionally after having<br>
been subjected to a calcining step which will be<br>
described below.<br>
In the conventional way, and in the case when<br>
the catalyst employed comprises a support, the<br>
heteropolyacid is brought into contact with the said<br>
support by means, for example, of dry impregnation,<br>
although other ways are not a priori ruled out. In this<br>
regard, mention may be made of mixing the various<br>
constituents, heteropolyacid and support, in a solid<br>
form for example.<br>
According to the impregnation method, the<br>
support as defined above is brought into contact with a<br>
heteropolyacid solution in a quantity such that the<br>
atomic ratio, (C + E)/metallic element of the support,<br>
is between 0.1 and 30%, and preferably between 5 and<br>
20%.<br>
The resulting suspension is then dried. This<br>
drying step may advantageously be carried out in two<br>
steps: the first consisting in evaporating the solvent<br>
or dispersant of the mixture, more particularly water,<br>
to dryness, and the second in drying the paste thus<br>
obtained.<br>
The first step is generally carried out at a<br>
temperature varying from 20 to 100Â°C, optionally under<br>
vacuum, for the time needed to obtain a paste.<br>
The evaporation is usually carried out while<br>
stirring.<br>
The paste obtained is then dried, in a second<br>
step, under a preferably non-reducing atmosphere, such<br>
as oxygen or air for example, for an average time of<br>
15 h.<br>
The drying temperature is usually between 100<br>
and 150Â°C.<br>
It should be noted that other drying methods<br>
may be envisaged, for example spray-drying the<br>
suspension in any suitable type of equipment, and under<br>
conditions known to the person skilled in the art.<br>
The dried product is then subjected to a<br>
calcining step.<br>
This is carried out, in the conventional way,<br>
under a non-reducing atmosphere. Air is advantageously<br>
used, but oxygen could equally well be employed.<br>
The calcining temperature is usually between<br>
200 and 500Â°C.<br>
The duration of the operation generally<br>
varies between 1 and 24 h.<br>
Before and/or after the calcining step, the<br>
dried product may be subjected to a desegregation step.<br>
In the case when the catalyst employed in the<br>
process according to the invention comprises an inert<br>
material, the coating method is preferably employed.<br>
Thus, the inert material, preferably in the<br>
form of rough particles, and the active phase are<br>
brought into contact in a high-shear mixer (LODIGE type<br>
machine) or in a granulation machine (drum or disc<br>
granulators) .<br>
The operation is in general carried out at a<br>
temperature varying between 20 and 150Â°C for the time<br>
needed to coat the inert material with the desired<br>
quantity of active phase, more particularly under air,<br>
for at least 30 min.<br>
The particles thus obtained are usually<br>
calcined at a temperature of between 300 and 500Â°C.<br>
The calcining generally lasts at least 3 h.<br>
Of course, all these ways of preparing the<br>
heteropolyacid, and bringing the said HPA into contact<br>
with the support and/or inert material, have been given<br>
solely by way of indication and can in no way<br>
constitute an exhaustive list.<br>
As mentioned above, the process according to<br>
the invention consists in carrying out controlled<br>
oxidation of the substrate with an oxygen source, in<br>
the presence of a catalyst as described above.<br>
The said methylene unit is preferably a<br>
methyl.<br>
It is desirable if the said electronwithdrawing<br>
group (or atom) is not readily oxidizable.<br>
Advantageously/ the said electron-withdrawing<br>
group(s) (or atom(s)) have at least one halogen atom,<br>
advantageously fluorine.<br>
As mentioned in the introduction, the results<br>
are of particular benefit when the bond between the<br>
said group and the said &gt;CH- unit is attached to a<br>
carbon to which at least two halogen atoms are<br>
attached, advantageously at least one, and preferably<br>
at least two, of which are fluorine.<br>
The said electron-withdrawing group is an Rf<br>
group, and in particular the said group is selected<br>
from the trihalomethyl, tetrahaloethyl and<br>
pentahaloethyl groups. It is desirable that at least<br>
half of the said halogens are advantageously fluorine,<br>
and preferably the said group is selected from the<br>
trifluoromethyl, tetrafluoroethyl and pentafluoroethyl<br>
groups.<br>
As is evident from the description above, the<br>
said CH- unit has an alcoyl radical, a second (or even<br>
a third) electron-withdrawing group or, preferably, a<br>
hydrogen attached to it.<br>
The said methylene group (CH2) has a second<br>
electron-withdrawing group attached to it, which is<br>
linked to the first electron-withdrawing group to form<br>
a ring.<br>
The said CH- unit may have an acrylic unit<br>
attached to it.<br>
The said CH- unit may advantageously be a<br>
methylene group (CH2) , to which a hydrogen is preferably<br>
attached in order to form a methyl radical.<br>
Returning to the composition of the catalyst,<br>
it may be reiterated that, according to an advantageous<br>
variant of the present invention, the reaction is<br>
advantageously carried out in the presence of a<br>
catalyst whose active phase is obtained from a<br>
heteropolyacid of formula (I) in which D is phosphorus,<br>
E is vanadium, e is between 1 and 3 inclusive, d is<br>
equal to 1, the sum of c + e is equal to 12 and x = 40.<br>
The reaction is advantageously carried out in the<br>
presence of a catalyst whose said active phase is<br>
deposited on a support. In particular, the reaction is<br>
carried out in the presence of a catalyst whose said<br>
active phase is deposited on a support, and the support<br>
is selected from the dioxides of titanium, silicon,<br>
zirconium, cerium and tin, alumina, silica-alumina, or<br>
mixtures thereof.<br>
According to a particularly advantageous<br>
embodiment of the present invention, the reaction is<br>
carried out with a gas mixture comprising from 0.1 to<br>
99.9 mol% of substrate, and more particularly between<br>
0.1 and 3% or between 10 and 99 mol% of substrate, and<br>
air, oxygen or nitrogen monoxide is preferably used as<br>
the oxygen source .<br>
Furthermore, the reaction is carried out with<br>
a gas mixture comprising from 0.1 to 99.9 mol% of<br>
oxygen, and more particularly comprising between 1 and<br>
90% or between 97 and 99.9 mol% of oxygen.<br>
Advantageously, use is made of a gas mixture<br>
having a substrate/oxygen molar ratio of less than 20<br>
and more particularly between 0.01 and 0.2 or between<br>
0.6 and 18.<br>
According to an advantageous variant of the<br>
present invention, the reaction is carried out in the<br>
presence of a diluent selected from water, or the inert<br>
gases, or recycled gases from the reaction,<br>
individually or as a mixture and more particularly a<br>
gas mixture comprising 0.1 to 70 mol% of water, and<br>
preferably comprising from 1 to 20 mol% of water.<br>
According to a particularly advantageous<br>
embodiment of the present invention, the heteropolyacid<br>
of formula (I) satisfies the empirical formula (III) : H3<br>
with:<br>
*Â¥ representing the following atoms or entities: P, As,<br>
Sb, HSi, HGe, H2B;<br>
A representing the following atoms or entities: W, Mo,<br>
HV and mixtures thereof .<br>
Â¥ represents pentavalent entity (or atom)<br>
Advantageously, as mentionned before, *F represents; P,<br>
As and preferably Phosphorus.<br>
A represents hexavalent entity (or atom).<br>
It is desirable that when A represents a mixture the<br>
atomic ration (Mo + W) / (W + Mo + HV) est at least equal<br>
to 0,5.<br>
It is desirable that the heteropolyacid of<br>
formula (III) has a so-called Keggin structure.<br>
According to the present invention, the role<br>
of delta is important for the level of oxidation<br>
obtained (see below).<br>
Thus, the heteropolyacid of formula (III) may<br>
be such that A is a mixture of at least two atoms or<br>
entities. :v<br>
According to one option, the heteropolyacid<br>
of formula (III) is such that A has a W/Mo atomic ratio<br>
at least equal to 1/2, advantageously 1, preferably 2.<br>
According to a variant, the heteropolyacid of<br>
formula (III) is such that A has a V/(W + Mo + V)<br>
atomic ratio at least equal to 1/12, advantageously<br>
1/6, preferably 1/4.<br>
More precisely, if it is desired for the<br>
substrate to be oxidized to form a carboxylic acid<br>
(essentially in the case when the said &gt;CH- unit is<br>
methyl) it will be preferable if the heteropolyacid of<br>
formula (III) and the cationic entity of formula II are<br>
such that the atomic ratio between the total number of<br>
hydrogens present and *F is at least equal to 3,<br>
advantageously 4, preferably 5.<br>
If it is desired for the substrate to be<br>
oxidized to the average state II (for example to form<br>
an ester or a ketone), it will be preferred that the<br>
heteropolyacid of formula (III) and the cationic entity<br>
of formula II are such that the atomic ratio between<br>
the total number of hydrogens present and *F is at least<br>
equal to 2, and at most equal to 3.<br>
If it is desired for the substrate to be<br>
oxidized to form an ether, it will be preferred that<br>
the heteropolyacid of formula (III) and the cationic<br>
entity of formula II are such that the atomic ratio<br>
between the total number of hydrogens present and *F is<br>
at most equal to 3, advantageously 2, preferably 1.<br>
The present invention thus also relates to a<br>
composition which includes a support phase selected<br>
from the dioxides of titanium, zirconium and a mixture<br>
thereof, and at least one heteropolyacid phase of<br>
formula III in which A has a W/Mo atomic ratio at least<br>
equal to 1/12, advantageously 1/4, preferably 1/3.<br>
It also relates to a composition in which the<br>
heteropolyacid of formula (III) and the cationic entity<br>
of formula II are such that the atomic ratio between<br>
the total number of hydrogens present and *F is at most<br>
equal to 3, advantageously 2, preferably 1.<br>
It also relates to a composition in which the<br>
heteropolyacid of formula (III) and the cationic entity<br>
of formula II are such that the atomic ratio between<br>
the total number of hydrogens present and *Â¥ is at least<br>
equal to 3, advantageously 4, preferably 5.<br>
According to an advantageous variant of the<br>
present invention, the heteropolyacid of formula (III)<br>
and the cationic entity of formula II are such that the<br>
atomic ratio between the total number of hydrogens<br>
present and *F is at least equal to 2, and at most equal<br>
to 3.<br>
Advantageously, the heteropolyacid of formula<br>
(III) has a so-called Keggin structure.<br>
Preferably, the heteropolyacid of formula<br>
(III) is such that A is a mixture1of at least two atoms<br>
or entities.<br>
It is beneficial if the heteropolyacid has a<br>
formula (III) such that A corresponds to a W/Mo atomic<br>
ratio at least equal to 1/2, advantageously 1,<br>
preferably 2.<br>
It may also be advantageous if the<br>
heteropolyacid has a formula (III) such that A<br>
corresponds to a V/(W + Mo + V) atomic ratio at least<br>
equal to 1/12, advantageously 1/6, preferably 1/4.<br>
The following non-limiting examples<br>
illustrate the invention.<br>
Catalysts<br>
A dry run was carried out, that is to say a<br>
test of the TiO2 support at 250Â°C for seven hours.<br>
It was found that this solid has weak<br>
activity (3 
to combustion (COX Sel. = 95%).<br>
Three groups of catalysts may be identified:<br>
Selectivity with<br>
respect to<br>
Selectivity with<br>
respect to ether (VO)HPMol20Â«o<br>
Pressure<br>
Reactants<br>
Operating conditions<br>
Sample mass: 1 gram of powdered catalyst (diluted to<br>
3 ml in silicon carbide),<br>

- Ether : (CF3CH2)20<br>
- TFA : Trifluoroacetic acid<br>
The model test lasts two days and includes<br>
two parts.<br>
1.1 Test at variable temperature<br>
Effluent gases are analysed with a<br>
temperature increment of 25Â°C between 175 and 250Â°C,<br>
that is to say four analyses separated by an interval<br>
of 1 h 15 each.<br>
The results are analysed and used to<br>
determine the optimum temperature for the operating<br>
point in the second part.<br>
Catalysts selective with respect to TFA<br>
(trifluoroacetic acid)<br>
1.2 Test at optimum temperature<br>
This is the temperature at which the best<br>
compromise is obtained between the overall conversion<br>
ratio for F143a and the total selectivity with respect<br>
to controlled-oxidation products (apart from<br>
combustion: CO2 and CO) .<br>
This temperature is either 225Â°C or 250Â°C.<br>
On the basis of this temperature's being kept<br>
constant, one analysis per hour is made in order to<br>
monitor the variation in the performance as a function<br>
of time. The study time varied from 5 h 3 0 to 46 h 00,<br>
according to:<br>
The stability of the values observed,<br>
The possible decrease in the conversion ratio for<br>
the initial F143a.<br>
Catalysts selective with respect to TFA<br>
2. Preparation and characteristics of the catalysts<br>
The HPAs were dry-impregnated on the TiO2<br>
support using the procedure described above.<br>
The TiO2 support has a specific surface area<br>
of 86 m2/kg, and a pore volume measured with water equal<br>
to 0.94 ml/g.<br>
The impregnation was carried out on 10 g of<br>
support and calculated so as to obtain a theoretical<br>
monolayer of HPA on it, such that:<br>
total metals/Ti = 0.167 by atom.<br>
The mass of HPA was dissolved in 9.4 ml of<br>
deionized water at 40Â°C. The support was then<br>
impregnated with the clear solution at room<br>
temperature.<br>
In some cases, two successive impregnation<br>
operations were needed, with drying at 120Â°C in<br>
between, in order to dissolve the requisite mass of<br>
HPA.<br>
The solids were dried at 110Â°C and tested as<br>
such.<br>
The following table summarizes the<br>
preparations which were made.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
