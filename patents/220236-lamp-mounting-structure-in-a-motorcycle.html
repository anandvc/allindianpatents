"LAMP MOUNTING STRUCTURE IN A MOTORCYCLE"<br>
HONDA GIKEN KOGYO KABUSHIKI KAISHA, a corporation of Japan, having a place of business at 1-1, Minamiaoyama 2-chome, Minato-ku, Tokyo, Japan,<br><br><br><br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br>
GRANTED<br>
29-8-2007<br><br><br>
The present invention  relates to lamp mounting structure in a <br>
motorcycle.<br>
 [Detailed Description of the Invention]  [Technical Field of the Invention]<br>
The present invention relates to a motorcycle wherein a head pipe at the front end of a vehicle body frame is covered by a front cowl supported on the vehicle body frame from the front, and a lamp unit including a winker lamp and a headlamp being disposed on a base to be mounted on the aforementioned front cowl from the rear is mounted on the front cowl in such a manner that the aforementioned headlamp and winker lamp are faced toward the opening formed at the front of the aforementioned front cowl, and more specifically, to an improved mounting structure of the winker lamp and the headlamp.<br>
[0002]<br>
[Description of the Related Art]<br>
Hitherto, a motorcycle provided with a lamp unit including a winker lamp and a headlamp mounted on the front cowl from the rear side is already known, for example, in JP-A-11-278334.<br>
[0003]	<br>
[Problems to be Solved by the Invention]<br>
In the lamp unit in the related art described above; a<br><br>
maintenance lid is detachably attached on the front surface of the front cowl upwardly of the opening formed on the front portion of the front cowl for exposing the headlamp and the winker lamp therethrough, so that maintenance such as replacement of winker lamp bulb is performed by removing the maintenance lid.<br>
[0004]<br>
Therefore, provision of the maintenance lid on the front surface of the front cowl may decrease flexibility in design of the front cowl. In addition, in the case where a windscreen is continuously provided above the front cowl and the distance between the aforementioned opening and the windscreen is limited, a space for disposing the aforementioned maintenance lid may not be secured.<br>
[0005]<br>
In view of such circumstances, an object of the present invention is to provide a lamp mounting structure for a motorcycle in which flexibility in design of the front cowl is increased, and simultaneously, maintenanceability of the winker lamp valve is increased.<br>
[0006]<br>
[Means for Solving the Problem]<br>
In order to achieve the above-described object, the invention according to Claim 1 is a motorcycle wherein a head pipe at the front end of a vehicle body frame is covered by<br><br>
a front cowl supported on the vehicle body frame from the front, and a lamp unit including a winker lamp and a headlamp being disposed on a base to be mounted on the aforementioned front cowl from the rear is mounted on the front cowl in such a manner that the aforementioned winker lamp and headlamp are exposed through the openings formed at the front of the aforementioned front cowl, characterized in that a bulb maintenance lid for covering the portion of the winker lamp bulb constituting a part of the aforementioned winker lamp to be mounted on the rear portion of the aforementioned base is detachably attached on top of the rear portion of the front cowl.<br>
[0007]<br>
According to the structure of the invention as set forth in Claim 1, since the bulb maintenance lid may be detachably attached on top of the rear portion of the front cowl while covering the mounting portion for mounting the winker lamp bulb on the rear portion of the base, maintenance of the winker lamp bulb may be done easily by removing the bulb maintenance lid. In addition, since it is not necessary to provide the bulb maintenance lid on the front surface of the front cowl, flexibility in design of the front cowl may be increased.<br>
[0008]<br>
In addition to the structure of the invention according to Claim 1, the invention as set forth in Claim 2 is characterized in that a meter unit to be disposed behind the<br><br>
aforementioned front cowl is mounted on a supporting stay fixed to the aforementioned head pipe, and the aforementioned bulb maintenance lid is detachably attached on top of the rear portion of the front cowl while covering the portion of the aforementioned meter unit to be mounted on the aforementioned supporting stay. According to such arrangement, maintenance of the meter unit may also be done by removing the bulb maintenance lid.<br>
[0009]<br>
In addition to the structure of the invention according to Claim 1 or 2, the invention as set forth in Claim 3 is characterized in that the aforementioned front cowl includes a pair of left and right side cowls disposed on both sides of the aforementioned head pipe and supported by the vehicle body frame, and a center cowl disposed forwardly of the aforementioned head pipe to be connected to both of the side cowls, and in that the aforementioned lamp unit is mounted on both of the side cowls and the center cowl respectively. In this arrangement, since the front cowl is constructed of the center cowl and the pair of side cowls, flexibility in design is further increased in comparison with the case in which the front cowl is formed of a single piece of member. In addition, since the lamp unit also serves as a joint between both of the side cowls and the center cowl, both of the side cowls and the center cowl may be strongly joined with a small number of<br><br>
components.<br>
[0010]<br>
In addition to the structure of the invention according to any one of Claims l to 3, the invention as set forth in Claim 4 is further characterized in that the aforementioned winker lamp bulb is mounted on the base so as to be positioned at the center of a reflecting mirror portion provided on the aforementioned base, in that a reflector of the aforementioned headlamp is supported on the aforementioned base so as to be capable of swinging in the vertical direction at the position where the reflector is partially overlapped with the aforementioned reflecting mirror portion when viewed from the front, in that the aforementioned reflector is provided with a reflecting wall portion for reflecting a light from the aforementioned winker lamp toward the front so as to extend toward the aforementioned reflecting mirror portion at the part corresponding to the aforementioned reflecting mirror portion, and in that the reflecting wall portion is formed in a shape which can avoid interference with the aforementioned reflecting mirror portion in association with the swinging movement of the aforementioned reflector.<br>
[0011]<br>
According to such structure of the invention as set forth in Claim 4, the headlamp and the winker lamp may be disposed close to each other while preventing a light emitted forward<br><br>
from the winker lamp from being interrupted by the headlamp,<br>
whereby the lamp unit may be formed compactly.<br>

unit 88 may also be performed by removing the bulb maintenance<br>
lids 108	<br>
[0054]<br>
The front cowl 34 includes a pair of left and right side cowls 42, 42 disposed on both sides of the head pipe 12 and supported by the vehicle body frame F, and the center cowl 43 disposed ahead of the head pipe 12 and connected to both of the side cowls 42, 42, and thus flexibility in design may further be increased in comparison with the case of constructing the front cowl of a single member.<br>
[0055]<br>
The lamp unit 60 is mounted on both of the side cowls 42,42 and the center cowl 43 respectively, and thus also serves as a joint between both of the side cowls 42, 42 and the center cowl 43, both of the side cowls 42, 42 and the center cowl 43 may be strongly joined with a small number of components.<br>
[0056]<br>
Furthermore, the winker lamp bulb 66 is mounted on the base 63 so as to be positioned at the center of the first reflecting mirror portion 63a provided on the base 63, the reflector 65 of the headlamp 62 is supported on the base 63 so as to be capable of swinging in the vertical direction at<br><br>
the position where the reflector overlaps the first reflecting mirror portion 63a when viewed from the front, and the reflector 65 is provided with a reflecting wall portion 74 for reflecting a light from the winker lamp 61 toward the front so as to extend toward the first reflecting mirror portion 63a at the part corresponding to the first reflecting mirror portion 63a. In addition, since the reflector 65 is adapted to swing in the vertical direction, the aforementioned reflecting wall portion 74 is formed in the shape which can avoid interference with the first reflecting mirror portion 63a in association with the swinging motion of the reflector 65.<br>
[0057]<br>
Therefore, the winker lamp 61 and the headlamp 62 may be disposed close to each other while preventing a light emitted forward from the winker lamp 61 from being interrupted by the headlamp 62 as much as possible, whereby the lamp unit 60 may be formed compactly.<br>
