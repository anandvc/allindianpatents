				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>AN ATMOSPHERIC PRESSURE PLASMA ASSEMBLY<br>
 [0001]	The present inyention ralates to an atmospheric pressure plasma assembly and<br>
a method of treating a substrate using said assembly.<br>
[0002]	When matter is continually supplied with energy, its temperature increases and it<br>
typically transforms from a solid to a liquid and, then, to a gaseous state. Continuing to supply<br>
energy causes the system to undergo yet a further change of state in which neutral atoms or<br>
molecules of the gas are broken up by energetic collisions to produce negatively charged<br>
electrons, positive or negatively charged ions and other species. This mix of charged particles<br>
exhibiting collective behaviour is called "plasma", the fourth state of matter. Due to their<br>
electrical charge, plasmas are highly influenced by external electromagnetic fields, which makes<br>
them readily controllable. Furthermore, their high energy content allows them to achieve<br>
processes which are impossible or difficult through the other states of matter, such as by liquid<br>
or gas processing.<br>
№003]	The term "plasma" covers a huge range of systems whose density and<br>
temperature vary by many orders of magnitude. Some plasmas are very hot and all their<br>
microscopic species (ions, electrons, etc.) are in approximate thermal equilibrium, the energy<br>
input into the system being widely distributed through atomic/molecular level collisions. Other<br>
plasmas, however, particular those at low pressure (e.g. 100 Pa) where collisions are relatively<br>
infrequent, have their constituent species at widely different temperatures and are called "non-<br>
thermal equilibrium" plasmas. In these non-thermal plasmas the free electrons are very hot with<br>
temperatures of many thousands of Kelvin (K) whilst the neutral and ionic species remain cool.<br>
Because the free electrons have almost negligible mass, the total system heat content is low and<br>
the plasma operates close to room temperature thus allowing the processing of temperature<br>
sensitive materials, such as plastics or polymers, without imposing a damaging thermal burden<br>
onto the sample. However, the hot electrons create, through high energy collisions, a rich<br>
source of radicals and excited species with a high chemical potential energy capable of profound<br>
chemical and physical reactivity. It is this combination of low temperature operation plus high<br>
reactivity which makes non-thermal plasma technologically important and a very powerful tool<br>
for manufacturing and material processing, capable of achieving processes which, if achievable<br><br>
at all without plasma, would require very high temperatures or noxious and aggressive<br>
chemicals.<br>
[0004]	For industrial applications of plasma technology, a convenient method is to<br>
couple electromagnetic power into a volume of process gas, which can be mixtures of gases and<br>
vapours in which the workpieces/samples to be treated are immersed or passed through. The<br>
gas becomes ionised into plasma, generating chemical radicals, UV-radiation, and ions, which<br>
react with the surface of the samples. By correct selection of process gas composition, driving<br>
power frequency, power coupling mode, pressure and other control parameters, the plasma<br>
process can be tailored to the specific application required by a manufacturer.<br>
[0005]	Because of the huge chemical and thermal range of plasmas, they are suitable for<br>
many technological applications. Non-thermal equilibrium plasmas are particularly effective for<br>
surface activation, surface cleaning, material etching and coating of surfaces.<br>
[0006]	The surface activation of polymeric materials is a widely used industrial plasma<br>
technology pioneered by the automotive industry. Thus, for example, polyolefins, such as<br>
polyethylene and polypropylene, which are favoured for their recylability, have a non-polar<br>
surface and consequently a poor disposition to coating or gluing. However, treatment by<br>
oxygen plasma results in the formation of surface polar groups giving high wettability and<br>
consequently excellent coverage and adhesion to metal paints, adhesives or other coatings.<br>
Thus, for example, plasma surface engineering is becoming increasingly important in the<br>
manufacture of vehicle fascias, dashboards, bumpers and the like as well as in component<br>
assembly in the toy and like industries. Many other applications are available in the printing,<br>
painting, gluing, laminating and general coating of components of all geometries in polymer,<br>
plastic, ceramic/inorganic, metal and other materials.<br>
[0007]	The increasing pervasiveness and strength of environmental legislation world-<br>
wide is creating substantial pressure on industry to reduce or eliminate the use of solvents and<br>
other wet chemicals in manufacturing, particularly for component/surface cleaning. In<br>
particular, CFC-based degreasing operations have been largely replaced by plasma cleaning<br>
technology operating with oxygen, air and other non-toxic gases. Combining water based pre-<br><br>
cleaning operations with plasma allows even heavily soiled components to be cleaned; the<br>
resulting surface qualities obtained being generally superior to those resulting from traditional<br>
methods. Any organic surface contamination is rapidly scavenged by room temperature plasma<br>
and converted to gaseous CO2 and water, which can be safely exhausted.<br>
[0003]	Plasmas can also carry out etching of a bulk material, i.e. for the removal of<br>
unwanted material therefrom. Thus, for example, an oxygen based plasma will etch polymers, a<br>
process used in the production of circuit boards, etc. Different materials such as metals,<br>
ceramics and inorganics are etched by careful selection of precursor gas and attention to the<br>
plasma chemistry. Structures down to nanometer critical dimensions are now being produced<br>
by plasma etching technology.<br>
[0089]	A plasma technology that is rapidly emerging into mainstream industry is that of<br>
plasma coating/thin film deposition. Typically, a high level of polymerisation is achieved by<br>
application of plasma to monomelic gases and vapours. Thus, a dense, tightly knit and three-<br>
dimensionally connected film can be formed which is thermally stable, chemically very resistant<br>
and mechanically robust. Such films are deposited conformally on even the most intricate of<br>
surfaces and at a temperature which ensures a low thermal burden on the substrate. Plasmas are<br>
therefore ideal for the coating of delicate and heat sensitive, as well as robust materials. Plasma<br>
coatings are free of micropores even with thin layers. The optical properties, e.g. colour, of the<br>
coating can often be customised and plasma coatings adhere well to even non-polar materials,<br>
e.g. polyethylene, as well as steel (e.g. anti-corrosion films on metal reflectors), ceramics,<br>
semiconductors, textiles, etc.<br>
[0010]	In all these processes, plasma engineering produces a surface effect customised<br>
to the desired application or product without affecting the material bulk in any way. Plasma<br>
processing thus offers the manufacturer a versatile and powerful tool allowing choice of a<br>
material for its bulk technical and commercial properties while giving the freedom to<br>
independently engineer its surface to meet a totally different set of needs. Plasma technology<br>
thus confers greatly enhanced product functionality, performance, lifetime and quality and gives<br>
the manufacturing company significant added value to its production capability.<br><br>
[0011]	These properties provide a strong motivation for industry to adopt plasma-based<br>
processing, and this move has been led since the 1960s by the microelectronics community<br>
which has developed the low pressure Glow Discharge plasma into an ultra-high technology and<br>
high capital cost engineering tool for semiconductor, metal and dielectric processing. The same<br>
low pressure Glow Discharge type plasma has increasingly penetrated other industrial sectors<br>
since the 1980s offering, at more moderate cost, processes such as polymer surface activation<br>
for increased adhesion/bond strength, high quality degreasing/cleaning and the deposition of<br>
high performance coatings. Thus, there has been a substantial take-up of plasma technology.<br>
Glow discharges can be achieved at both vacuum and atmospheric pressures. In the case of<br>
atmospheric pressure glow discharge, gases such as helium or argon are utilised as diluents<br>
and a high frequency (e.g.&gt; 1kHz) power supply is used to generate a homogeneous glow<br>
discharge at atmospheric pressure via a Penning ionisation mechanism, (see for example,<br>
Kanazawa et al, J.Phys. D: Appl. Phys. 1988,21,838, Okazaki et al, Proc. Jpn. Symp. Plasma<br>
Chem. 1989,2,95, Kanazawa et al, Nuclear Instruments and Methods in Physical Research<br>
1989, B37/38,842, and Yokoyama et al., J. Phys. D: Appl. Phys. 1990,23,374).<br>
[0012]	However, adoption of plasma technology has been limited by a major constraint<br>
on most industrial plasma systems, namely, their need to operate at low pressure. Partial<br>
vacuum operation means a closed perimeter, sealed reactor system providing only off-line,<br>
batch processing of discrete workpieces. Throughput is low or moderate and the need for<br>
vacuum adds capital and running costs.<br>
[0013]	Atmospheric pressure plasmas, however, offer industry open port or perimeter<br>
systems providing free ingress into and exit from the plasma region by workpieces/webs and,<br>
hence, on-line, continuous processing of large or small area webs or conveyor-carried discrete<br>
workpieces. Throughput is high, reinforced by the high species flux obtained from high<br>
pressure operation. Many industrial sectors, such as textiles, packaging, paper, medical,<br>
automotive, aerospace, etc., rely almost entirely upon continuous, on-line processing so that<br>
open port/perimeter configuration plasmas at atmospheric pressure offer a new industrial<br>
processing capability.<br><br>
[0014]	Corona and flame (also a plasma) treatment systems have provided industry with<br>
a limited form of atmospheric pressure plasma processing capability for about 30 years.<br>
However, despite their high manufacturability, these systems have failed to penetrate the market<br>
or be taken up by industry to anything like the same extent as the lower pressure, bath-<br>
processing-only plasma type. The reason is that corona/flame systems have significant<br>
limitations. They operate in ambient air offering a single surface activation process and have a<br>
negligible effect on many materials and a weak effect on most. The treatment is often non-<br>
uniform and the corona process is incompatible with thick webs or 3D workpieces while the<br>
flame process is incompatible with heat sensitive substrates.<br>
[0015]	Significant advances have been made in plasma treatment at atmospheric<br>
pressure. Considerable work has been done on the stabilisation of atmospheric pressure glow<br>
discharges, such as in Okazaki et al., J. Phys. D: Appl. Phys. 26 (1993) 889-892. Further,<br>
there is described in US Patent Specification No. 5414324 (Roth et al) the generation of a<br>
steady-state glow discharge plasma at atmospheric pressure between a pair of insulated metal<br>
plate electrodes spaced up to 5 cm apart and radio frequency (KF) energised with a root mean<br>
square (rms) potential of 1 to 5 kV at 1 to 100 kHz. This patent specification describes the<br>
use of electrically insulated metallic plate electrodes and also the problems of electrode plates<br>
and the need to discourage electrical breakdown at the edge of electrodes. It further describes<br>
the use of the electrodes, which in this case are copper plates, and a water cooling system,<br>
which is supplied through fluid flow conduits bonded to the electrodes and as such, water<br>
does not come into direct contact with any electrode surface.<br>
[0016]	In US Patent Specification No. 5185132, (Horiike et al), there is described an<br>
atmospheric plasma reaction method in which plate electrodes are used in a vertical<br>
configuration. However, they are merely used in the vertical configuration to prepare the<br>
plasma and then the plasma is directed out from between the plates onto a horizontal surface<br>
below the vertically arranged electrodes and downstream from the plasma source.<br>
[0016]	In EP 0809275 and JP 11 -29873 here are provided atmospheric pressure glow<br>
discharge systems having at least two sets of horizontally arrayed pairs of electrodes through<br>
which a substrate web may be passed continuously by means of rollers. JP 11-241165 and JP<br><br>
2000-212753 describe electric discharge type plasma system using pulsed electric fields. In all<br>
four of these documents the substrate is treated with gases.<br>
[0018]	In the applicants co-pending application WO 02/35576, which was published<br>
after the priority date of the present application, a plasma system of the type comprising a pair<br>
of parallel spaced-apart planar electrodes with at least one dielectric plate therebetween and<br>
adjacent one electrode, the spacing between the dielectric plate and the other dielectric plate<br>
or electrodes forming a plasma region for a precursor gas wherein a cooling liquid distribution<br>
system is provided for directing a cooling conductive liquid onto the exterior of at least one of<br>
the electrodes to cover a planar face of the at least one electrode.<br>
[0019]	According to the present invention there is provided an atmospheric pressure<br>
plasma assembly comprising a first and second pair of vertically arrayed, parallel spaced-apart<br>
planar electrodes with at least one dielectric plate between said first pair, adjacent one electrode<br>
and at least one dielectric plate between said second pair adjacent one electrode, the spacing<br>
between the dielectric plate and the other dielectric plate or electrode of each of the first and<br>
second pairs of electrodes forming a first and second plasma region characterised in that the<br>
assembly further comprises a means of transporting a substrate successively through said first<br>
and second plasma regions and an atomiser adapted to introduce an atomised liquid or solid<br>
coating making material into one of said first or second plasma regions.<br>
[0020]	The terms "comprise, comprises, comprised and comprising" or any variation<br>
thereof and the terms "include, includes, included and including" or any variation thereof are<br>
considered to be totally interchangeable and they should all be afforded the widest possible<br>
interpretation.<br>
[0021]	It should be understood that the term vertical is intended to include substantially<br>
vertical and should not be restricted solely to electrodes positioned at 90 degrees to the<br>
horizontal.<br>
[0022]	Preferably the means of transporting the substrate is by a reel to reel based<br>
process. The substrate may be transported through the first plasma region in an upwardly or<br><br>
downwardly direction. Preferably when the substrate passes through one plasma zone in an<br>
upwardly direction and the other in a downwardly direction one or more guide rollers are<br>
provided to guide the substrate from the end of the first reel into the first plasma zone, from the<br>
first plasma zone to and into the second plasma zone and from the second plasma zone to the<br>
second reel or next plasma zone dependent on the number of plasma zones being used. The<br>
substrate residence time in each plasma region may be predetermined prior to coating and<br>
rather than varying the speed of the substrate, through each plasma zone, the path length a<br>
substrate has to travel through each plasma region may be altered such that the substrate may<br>
pass through both regions at the same speed but may spend a different period of time in each<br>
plasma region due to differing path lengths through the respective plasma regions.<br>
[0023]	In view of the fact that the electrodes in the present invention are vertically<br>
orientated it is preferred that a substrate be transported through an atmospheric pressure plasma<br>
assembly in accordance with the present invention upwardly through one plasma region and<br>
downwardly though the other plasma region. On the basis of the distance between adjacent<br>
electrodes, as will be discussed below, it will be appreciated that the substrate is generally<br>
transported through a plasma region in a vertical or diagonal direction although in most cases it<br>
will be vertical or substantially vertical.<br>
[0024]	Preferably each substrate needs only to be subjected to one pass through the<br>
assembly but if required the substrate may be returned to the first reel for further passages<br>
through the assembly.<br>
[0025]	Additional pairs of electrodes may be added to the system to form further<br>
successive plasma regions through which a substrate would pass. The additional pairs of<br>
electrodes may be situated before or after said first and second pair of electrodes such that<br>
substrate would be subjected to pre-treatment or post-treatment steps. Said additional pairs of<br>
electrodes are preferably situated before or after and most preferably after said first and second<br>
pairs of electrodes. Treatments applied in the plasma regions formed by the additional pairs of<br>
electrodes may be the same or different from that undertaken in the first and second plasma<br>
regions. In the case when additional plasma regions are provided for pre-treatment or post-<br>
treatment the necessary number of guides and/or rollers will be provided in order to ensure the<br><br>
passage of the substrate through the assembly. Similarly preferably the substrate will be<br>
transported alternatively upwardly and downwardly through all neighbouring plasma regions in<br>
the assembly.<br>
[0026]	Each electrode may comprise any suitable geometry and construction. Metal<br>
electrodes may be used and may be in for example the form of metallic plates or a mesh. The<br>
metal electrodes may be bonded to the dielectric material either by adhesive or by some<br>
application of heat and fusion of the metal of the electrode to the dielectric material.<br>
Alternatively one or more of the electrodes may be encapsulated within the dielectric material or<br>
may be in the form of a dielectric material with a metallic coating such as, for example a<br>
dielectric, preferably a glass dielectric with a sputtered metallic coating.<br>
[0027]	In one embodiment of the invention each electrode is of the type described in<br>
the applicants co-pending application WO 02/35576 wherein there are provided electrode<br>
units containing an electrode and an adjacent a dielectric plate and a cooling liquid<br>
distribution system for directing a cooling conductive liquid onto the exterior of the electrode<br>
to cover a planar face of the electrode. Each electrode unit may comprise a watertight box<br>
having a side formed by a dielectric plate having bonded thereto on the interior of the box the<br>
planar electrode together with a liquid inlet and a liquid outlet. The liquid distribution system<br>
may comprise a cooler and a recirculation pump and/or a sparge pipe incorporating spray<br>
nozzles.<br>
[0028]	Ideally the cooling liquid covers the face of the electrode remote from the<br>
dielectric plate. The cooling conductive liquid is preferably water and may contain conductivity<br>
controlling compounds such as metal salts or soluble organic additives. Ideally, the electrode is<br>
a metal electrode in contact with the dielectric plate. In one embodiment, there is a pair of metal<br>
electrodes each in contact with a dielectric plate. The water in accordance with the present<br>
invention acts as well as being an extremely efficient cooling agent to also assist in providing an<br>
efficient electrode.<br>
[0029]	Ideally the dielectric plate extends beyond the perimeter of the electrode and<br>
the cooling liquid is also directed across the dielectric plate to cover at least that portion of<br><br>
dielectric bordering the periphery of the electrode. Preferably, all the dielectric plate is<br>
covered with cooling liquid. The electrode may be in the form of a metal mesh The water<br>
also acts to electrically passivate any boundaries, singularities or non-uniformity in the metal<br>
electrodes such as edges, corners or mesh ends where the wire mesh electrodes are used.<br>
Effectively the water acts as an electrode of limited conductivity. Further, by having a<br>
vertical arrangement, the weight of large areas of electric systems are now placed so that there<br>
is not the same sag or distortion or deformation that there might otherwise be.<br>
[0030]	The assembly is preferably retained in an outer casing as defined in the<br>
applicant's co-pending application WO 02/59809 in which a lid is provided to prevent escape<br>
of a process gas, which is required in order to activate the plasma. The lid may be situated on<br>
top of the outer casing, i.e. covering the top of all the electrodes or may be situated at the<br>
bottom of the casing, i.e. covering the base of all the electrodes, dependent on whether the<br>
process gas used is lighter or heavier than air (e.g. helium and argon respectively).<br>
[0051]	The dielectric materials used in accordance with the present invention may be<br>
made from any suitable dielectric, examples include but are not restricted to polycarbonate,<br>
polyethylene, glass, glass laminates, epoxy filled glass laminates and the like.<br>
[0932]	The process gas for use in plasma treatment processes using the electrodes of<br>
the present invention may be any suitable gas but is preferably an inert gas or inert gas based<br>
mixture such as, for example helium, a mixture of helium and argon and an argon based<br>
mixture additionally containing ketones and/or related compounds. These process gases may<br>
be utilized alone or in combination with potentially reactive gases such as, for example,<br>
nitrogen, ammonia, O2, H2O, NO2, air or hydrogen. Most preferably, the process gas will be<br>
Helium alone or in combination with an oxidizing or reducing gas. The selection of gas<br>
depends upon the plasma processes to be undertaken. When an oxidizing or reducing process<br>
gas is required, it will preferably be utilized in a mixture comprising 90 - 99% noble gas and<br>
1 to 10% oxidizing or reducing gas.<br>
[0033]	Under oxidising conditions the present method may be used to form an oxygen<br>
containing coating on the substrate. For example, silica-based coatings can be formed on the<br><br>
substrate surface from atomised silicon-containing coating-forming materials. Under<br>
reducing conditions, the present method may be used to form oxygen free coatings, for<br>
example, silicon carbide based coatings may be formed from atomised silicon containing<br>
coating forming materials.<br>
[0034]	In a nitrogen containing atmosphere nitrogen can bind to the substrate surface,<br>
 and in an atmosphere containing both nitrogen and oxygen, nitrates can bind to and/or form<br>
on the substrate surface. Such gases may also be used to pre-treat the substrate surface prior<br>
to exposure to a coating forming substance. For example, oxygen containing plasma<br>
treatment of the substrate may provide improved adhesion with the applied coating. The<br>
oxygen containing plasma being generated by introducing oxygen containing materials to the<br>
plasma such as oxygen gas or water.<br>
[0035]	A wide variety of plasma treatments are currently available, those of particular<br>
importance to the present invention are surface activation, surface cleaning and coating<br>
applications. Typically the substrate may be subjected to any appropriate treatment for example<br>
whilst passing through the first plasma region a substrate might be cleaned and when passing<br>
through the second plasma region the substrate might be surface activated, coated or etched and<br>
in the case when further plasma regions are provided after the first and second plasma regions<br>
said additional plasma regions may, when the second plasma region is utilised to activate a<br>
surface, further activate the surface, or apply a coating and when the second plasma region is<br>
utilised to coat the substrate surface, the additional plasma regions might be utilised to activated<br>
the coated surface and then re-coat the surface, apply a one or more further coatings or the like,<br>
dependent on the application for which the substrate is intended. For example, a coating<br>
formed on a substrate may be post treated in a range of plasma conditions. For example,<br>
siloxane derived coatings may be further oxidised by oxygen containing plasma treatment.<br>
The oxygen containing plasma being generated by introducing oxygen containing materials to<br>
the plasma such as oxygen gas or water.<br>
[0036]	Any appropriate combination of plasma treatments may be used, for example the<br>
 first plasma region may be utilised to clean the surface of the substrate by plasma treating using<br>
a helium gas plasma and the second plasma region is utilised to apply a coating, for example, by<br><br>
application of a liquid or solid spray through an atomiser or nebuliser as described in the<br>
applicants co-pending application 339/KOLNP/2003, which was published after the priority<br>
date of this application. The application of a coating of a liquid spray is particularly suited as<br>
the droplets in the spray will be subjected to gravitational feed unlike a gas such that the<br>
nebuliser is positioned in the assembly such that gravity feed of the coating material results in<br>
the coating precursor only passing through the second plasma region, thereby relying on gravity<br>
to prevent transfer of coating precursor into the first plasma region<br>
[0001]	Alternatively the first plasma region might be utilised as a means of oxidation<br>
(in for example, an oxygen/Helium process gas) or the application of coating and the second<br>
plasma region is utilised to apply a second coating using a different precursor. As an example<br>
having a pre-treatment and post-treatment step is the following process adapted for the<br>
preparation of a SiOx barrier with a soil/fuel resistant outer surface which may be utilised for<br>
solar cells or in auto applications in which the substrate is first pretreated by He<br>
cleaning/activation of substrate, followed by deposition of SiOx from a polydimethylsiloxane<br>
precursor in the first plasma region Further Helium plasma treatment to provide extra<br>
crosslinking of the SiOx layer and finally applying a coating utilizing a perfluorinated<br>
precursor. Any appropriate pre-treatments may be undertaken for example the substrate may<br>
be washed, dried, cleaned or gas purged using the process gas, for example helium<br>
[0002]	The coating-forming material may be atomised using any conventional means,<br>
for example an ultrasonic nozzle. The atomiser preferably produces a coating-forming<br>
material drop size of from 10 to 100μm, more preferably from 10 to 50μm. Suitable<br>
atomisers for use in the present invention are ultrasonic nozzles from Sono-Tek Corporation,<br>
Milton, New York, USA or Lechler GmbH of Metzingen Germany. The apparatus of the<br>
present invention may include a plurality of atomisers, which may be of particular utility, for<br>
example, where the apparatus is to be used to form a copolymer coating on a substrate from<br>
two different coating-forming materials, where the monomers are immiscible or are in<br>
different phases, e.g. the first is a solid and the second is gaseous or liquid.<br>
[0003]	The present invention may be used to form many different types of substrate<br>
coatings. The type of coating which is formed on the substrate is determined by the coating-<br><br>
forming material(s) used, and the present method may be used to (co)polymerise coating-<br>
forming monomer material(s) onto the substrate surface. The coating-forming material may<br>
be organic or inorganic, solid, liquid or gaseous, or mixtures thereof. Suitable organic<br>
coating-forming materials include carboxylates, methacrylates, acrylates, styrenes,<br>
methacrylonitriles, alkenes and dienes, for example methyl methacrylate, ethyl methacrylate,<br>
propyl methacrylate, butyl methacrylate, and other alkyl methacrylates, and the corresponding<br>
acrylates, including organofunctional methacrylates and acrylates, including glycidyl<br>
methacrylate, trimethoxysilyl propyl methacrylate, allyl methacrylate, hydroxyethyl<br>
methacrylate, hydroxypropyl methacrylate, dialkylaminoalkyl methacrylates, and fluoroalkyl<br>
(meth)acrylates, methacrylic acid, acrylic acid, fumaric acid and esters, itaconic acid (and<br>
esters), maleic anhydride, styrene, α-methylstyrene, halogenated alkenes, for example, vinyl<br>
halides, such as vinyl chlorides and vinyl fluorides, and fluorinated alkenes, for example<br>
perfluoroalkenes, acrylonitrile, methacrylonitrile, ethylene, propylene, allyl amine, vinylidene<br>
halides, butadienes, acrylamide, such as N-isopropylacrylamide, methacrylamide, epoxy<br>
compounds, for example glycidoxypropyltrimethoxysilane, glycidol, styrene oxide, butadiene<br>
monoxide, ethyleneglycol diglycidylether, glycidyl methacrylate, bisphenol A diglycidylether<br>
(and its oligomers), vinylcyclohexene oxide, conducting polymers such as pyrrole and<br>
thiophene and their derivatives, and phosphorus-containing compounds, for example<br>
dimethylallylphosphonate. Suitable inorganic coating-forming materials include metals and<br>
metal oxides, including colloidal metals. Organometallic compounds may also be suitable<br>
coating-forming materials, including metal alkoxides such as titanates, tin alkoxides,<br>
zirconates and alkoxides of germanium and erbium.<br>
[0040]	Substrates may alternatively be provided with silica- or siloxane-based<br>
coatings using coating-forming compositions comprising silicon-containing materials.<br>
Suitable silicon-containing materials include silanes (for example, si lane, alkylsilanes<br>
alkylhalosilanes, alkoxysilanes) and linear (for example, polydimethylsiloxane) and cyclic<br>
siloxanes (for example, octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane), including organo-functional linear and<br>
cyclic siloxanes (for example, Si-H containing, halo-functional, and haloalkyl-functional<br>
linear and cyclic siloxanes, e.g. tetramethylcyclotetrasijoxane and<br>
tri(nonofluorobutyl)trimethylcyclotrisiloxane). A mixture of different silicon-containing<br>
materials may be used, for example to tailor the physical properties of the substrate coating<br><br>
for a specified need (e.g. thermal properties, optical properties, such as refractive index, and<br>
viscoelastic properties).<br>
[0041]	An advantage of the present invention over the prior art is that both liquid and<br>
solid atomised coating-forming materials may be used to form substrate coatings, due to the<br>
method of the present invention taking place under conditions of atmospheric pressure.<br>
Furthermore the coating-forming materials can be introduced into the plasma discharge or<br>
resulting stream in the absence of a carrier gas, i.e. they can be introduced directly by, for<br>
example, direct injection, whereby the coating forming materials are injected directly into the<br>
plasma.<br>
[0042]	The substrate to be coated may comprise any material, sufficiently flexible to<br>
be transported through the assembly as hereinbefore described, for example plastics for<br>
example thermoplastics such as polyolefins e.g. polyethylene, and polypropylene,<br>
polycarbonates, polyurethanes, polyvinylchloride, polyesters (for example polyalkylene<br>
terephthalates, particularly polyethylene terephthalate), polymethacrylates (for example<br>
polymethylmethacrylate and polymers of hydroxyethylmethacrylate), polyepoxides,<br>
polysulphones, polyphenylenes, polyetherketones, polyimides, polyamides, polystyrenes,<br>
phenolic, epoxy and melamine-formaldehyde resins, and blends and copolymers thereof.<br>
Preferred organic polymeric materials are polyolefins, in particular polyethylene and<br>
polypropylene. Other substrates include metallic thin films made from e.g. aluminium, steel,<br>
stainless steel and copper or the like.<br>
[0043]	The substrate may be in the form of synthetic and/or, natural fibres, woven or<br>
non-woven fibres, powder, siloxane, fabrics, woven or non-woven fibres, natural fibres,<br>
synthetic fibres cellulosic material and powder or a blend of an organic polymeric material<br>
and a organosilicon-containing additive which is miscible or substantially non-miscible with<br>
the organic polymeric material as described in the applicants co-pending patent application<br>
WO 01/40359. For the avoidance of doubt "substantially non-miscible" means that the<br>
organosilicon-containing additive and the organic material have sufficiently different<br>
interaction parameters so as to be non-miscible in equilibrium conditions. This will typically,<br>
but not exclusively, be the case when the Solubility Parameters of the organosilicon-<br><br>
containing additive and the organic material differ by more than 0.5 MPal/2. However, the<br>
size of the substrate is limited by the dimensions of the volume within which the atmospheric<br>
pressure plasma discharge is generated, i.e. the distance between the electrodes of the means<br>
for generating the plasma.<br>
[0044]	In one particularly preferred embodiment of the invention there is provided an<br>
atmospheric plasma assembly for preparing multilayer coatings upon flexible substrates. The<br>
plasma is generated by vertically orientated electrodes, which can be arranged in series,<br>
enabling single pass, multiple treatment or multilayer coating. Coating forming material or<br>
coating precursor is introduced as an atomised liquid into the top of the chamber, the<br>
precursor then enters the plasma zone under gravity. Advantages are mat the different plasma<br>
zones require no physical barrier separation, and each operates as an open perimeter process.<br>
[0045]	For typical plasma generating apparatus, the plasma is generated within a gap<br>
 of from 3 to 50mm, for example 5 to 25mm. Thus, the present invention has particular utility<br>
for coating films, fibres and powders. The generation of steady-state glow discharge plasma<br>
at atmospheric pressure is preferably obtained between adjacent electrodes which may be<br>
spaced up to 5 cm apart, dependent on the process gas used. The electrodes being radio<br>
frequency energised with a root mean square (rms) potential of 1 to 100 kV, preferably<br>
between 1 and 30 kV at 1 to 100 kHz, preferably at 15 to 50 kHz. The voltage used to form<br>
the plasma will typically be between 1 and 30 kVolts, most preferably between 2.5 and 10 kV<br>
however the actual value will depend on the chemistry/gas choice and plasma region size<br>
between the electrodes. Whilst the atmospheric pressure glow discharge assembly may<br>
operate at any suitable temperature, it preferably will operate at a temperature between room<br>
temperature (20 ° C) and 70° C and is typically utilized at a temperature in the region of 30 to<br>
50 °C.<br>
[0046]	Substrates coated by the method of the present invention may have various<br>
uses. For example, a silica-based coating, generated in an oxidising atmosphere, may<br>
enhance the barrier and/or diffusion properties of the substrate, and may enhance the ability of<br>
additional materials to adhere to the substrate surface. A halo-functional organic or siloxane<br>
coating (e.g. perfluoroalkenes) may increase hydrophobicity, oleophobicity, fuel and soil<br><br>
resistance, enhance gas and liquid filtration properties and/or the release properties of the<br>
substrate. A polydimethylsiloxane coating may enhance water resistance and release<br>
properties of the substrate, and may enhance the softness of fabrics to touch; apolyacrylic<br>
acid polymeric coating may be used as a water wettable coating, bio-compatible coating or an<br>
adhesive layer to promote adhesion to substrate surface or as part of laminated structure. The<br>
inclusion of colloidal metal species in the coatings may provide surface conductivity to the<br>
substrate, or enhance its optical properties. Polythiophene and polypyrrole give electrically<br>
conductive polymeric coatings which may also provide corrosion resistance on metallic<br>
substrates. Acidic or basic functionality coatings will provide surfaces with controlled pH,<br>
and controlled interaction with biologically important molecules such as amino acids and<br>
proteins.<br>
[0047]	The invention will be more clearly understood from the following description<br>
of some embodiments thereof given by way of example only with reference to the<br>
accompanying drawings, in which :-<br>
Fig. 1 is a front view of an atmospheric pressure plasma system according to the<br>
invention,<br>
Fig. 2 is a partially exploded perspective view of portion of the system illustrated in Fig.<br>
1,<br>
Fig. 3 is a plan view of the plasma assembly in accordance with the present invention<br>
Fig. 4a and 4b are views of a further the plasma assembly in accordance with the present<br>
invention<br>
[0048]	Referring to the drawings, In Fig. 1 there is provided an atmospheric plasma<br>
system, indicated generally by the reference numeral 1 comprising an atmospheric pressure<br>
plasma assembly 2 fed by cables 3 by a power source 4 and also fed by a cooling water<br>
assembly feeding a cooling liquid distribution system mounted within the plasma assembly 2<br>
and described in more detail later. The cooling water assembly comprises a water pump 5, a<br><br>
cooler in the form of a heat exchanger 6 and mam water distribution pipes 7. One of the main<br>
water distribution pipes 7 feeds an inlet manifold 8, which in turn feeds, through feed water<br>
hoses 9 and liquid inlets 14, into the plasma assembly 2. Return water hoses 10 connect<br>
through liquid outlets 15, to a further return output manifold 11, which in turn is connected to<br>
another of the water distribution pipes 7 which feeds the pump 5. Pressure release pipes 13<br>
are mounted in the plasma assembly 2.<br>
[0049]	Referring now to Fig 2 in which there are provided three watertight boxes 20,<br>
26. The watertight boxes indicated generally by the reference numeral 20 are joined by vertical<br>
insulated spacers in the form of spacer plates 21 which form between the watertight boxes 20 an<br>
open top 22 and an open bottom 23. Each watertight box 20 comprises a rear plate 30 and a<br>
spaced apart front plate 31 mounted on a water containment frame 32 having a crossbar 33 in<br>
which are provided drain-off holes 34. The rear plate 30 and the front plate 31 are connected to<br>
the water containment frame 32 by gaskets 35. Two sets of wire electrodes 36 are mounted in<br>
the box 20 on the front plate 31. The rear plate 30, front plate 31 and water containment frame<br>
32 are manufactured of a suitable dielectric material. A pair of sparge poles 40 formed from<br>
pipes of an insulation material, such as a plastics material, carrying a plurality of nozzles 41 are<br>
mounted within the box 20 and are connected to the feed water hoses 9.<br>
[0050]	Between the watertight boxes 20 and the spacer plates 21, is a third watertight<br>
box 26 of substantially the same construction as the boxes 20, in which parts similar to those<br>
described for watertight box 20 below. The only difference between the box 26 and the box 20<br>
is that it carries effectively two front plates 31 and carries electrodes 36 on each front plate 31<br>
since the plates 31 act as front plates in respect of the boxes 20 on either side of the box 26. In<br>
this embodiment, the nozzles 41 of the sparge poles 40 direct water onto both plates 31.<br>
[0051]	In operation, a workpiece may be led up through plasma region 25 in the<br>
direction of the arrow A and then down through plasma region 60 in direction B. Process gas<br>
can be injected into the plasma regions 25,60 and suitable power can be provided to the<br>
electrodes 36 in the plasma regions 25,60 to affect a plasma. Water is delivered from the inlet<br>
manifold 8 through the feed water hoses 9 into the sparge poles 40 where the water is delivered<br><br>
in a spray out the nozzles 41 onto the wire electrodes 36 and also across the exposed interior<br>
face of the front plate 31.<br>
I<br>
[0052]	Referring now to Fig.3, there is provided a figure showing how a flexible<br>
substrate is treated in accordance with the present invention. A means of transporting a<br>
substrate through the assembly is provided in the form of guide rollers 70, 71 and 72, a process<br>
gas inlet 75, an assembly lid 76 and an ultrasonic nozzle 74 for introducing an atomised liquid<br>
into plasma region 60 are provided. The process gas inlet 75 may be found in the assembly lid<br>
76 instead of the side as shown in Fig. 3)<br>
[0053]	In use a flexible substrate is transported to and over guide roller 70 and is<br>
thereby guided through plasma region 25 between watertight boxes 20a and 26. The plasma in<br>
the plasma region 25 is a cleaning helium plasma, i.e. no reactive agent is directed into plasma<br>
region 25. The helium is introduced into the system by way of inlet 75. Lid 76 is placed over<br>
the top of the system to prevent the escape of helium as it is lighter than air. Upon leaving<br>
plasma region 25 the plasma cleaned substrate passes over guide 71 and is directed down<br>
through plasma region 60, between electrodes 26 and 20b and over roller 72 and then may pass<br>
to further units of the same type for further treatment. However, plasma region 60 generates a<br>
coating for the substrate by means of the injection of a liquid or sold coating making material<br>
through ultrasonic nozzle 74. An important aspect of the fact that the reactive agent being<br>
coated is a liquid or solid is that said atomised liquid or solid travels under gravity through<br>
plasma region 60 and is kept separate from plasma region 25 and as such no coating occurs in<br>
plasma region 25. The coated substrate then passes through plasma region 60 and is coated and<br>
then is transported over roller 72 and is collected or further treated with additional plasma<br>
treatments. Rollers 70 and 72 may be reels as opposed to rollers. Having passed through is<br>
adapted to guide the substrate into plasma region25 and on to roller 71.<br>
[0054]	It has been found surprisingly that in addition to cooling, the water in accordance<br>
with the present invention, also acts to electrically passivate any boundaries, singularities or<br>
non-uniformities in the metal electrodes such as edges, comers or mesh ends where wire mesh<br>
electrodes are used. It will be appreciated that these, without passivation, can discharge a<br>
Corona or other plasma, causing power loss and local heating leading potentially to breakdown.<br><br>
Essentially, the water itself acts as an electrode of limited conductivity to smooth out potential<br>
differences and damp out unwanted electrical discharges inside the electrode box. Typically,<br>
the plasma generated in the inter-electrode gap will extend about 5 cm beyond the edge of the<br>
metal electrode due to water conductivity. Further, there are major advantages in longer<br>
residence time in the plasma region which allows the plasma to access all parts of a workpiece<br>
surface enhancing uniformity of treatment. This is particularly important with intricately<br>
formed workpieces. It has been found with the present invention that it is possible to maintain<br>
low electrode temperatures even with high plasma power densities ensuring long equipment<br>
lifetimes and elimination of excessive thermal burdens on the workpiece. Radio Frequency<br>
power was applied using a power supply to the electrodes via matching transformers at<br>
approximately 40 kHz and about 30 kW of RF power.<br>
[0055]	Figs.4a and 4b are intended to show an assembly in accordance with the present<br>
invention in which there are provided four plasma zones a, b, c and d. In this assembly, there<br>
are two types of watertight box electrodes used. Two single electrode boxes 37a and 37b are<br>
used at the exterior of the assembly and three double electrode watertight boxes 38 are provided<br>
for interior plasma regions as will be described below. Each watertight box 37 comprises a<br>
polypropylene body with an glass dielectric window 47 external to the systems and a second<br>
glass dielectric window 49 which forms one edge of a plasma zone (zones a and d in the present<br>
examples). Adhered to glass dielectric window 49 is a mesh electrode 48. A water inlet 53 is<br>
provided for provision of a means of spraying the mesh electrode 48. A water outlet is also<br>
provided for drainage purposes but is not shown.<br>
[0056]	Double electrodes 38a 38b and 38c are similar in construction to electrodes 37a<br>
and 37b, in that they comprise polypropylene bodies, and two glass dielectric windows 51, but<br>
have a mesh electrode 52 attached to both windows 51. Again, a water inlet 53 is provided for<br>
spraying water on both mesh electrodes 51.<br>
[0057]	Rollers and guides 42,43,44,45 and 46 are provided to guide the substrate<br>
through the plasma regions a, b, c and d respectively.<br><br>
[0058]	In use, a substrate is provided on roller 42 and is transported to roller 46 via the<br>
pathway identified by the arrows and dotted lines. The substrate travels upwardly from roller 42<br>
to guide 43 through plasma region a formed between electrodes 37a and 38a. It then passes<br>
over guide 43 and into plasma region b between electrodes 38a and 38b to guide 44, upwardly<br>
to guide 45 and finally through plasma region d to roller 46. Typically plasma regions a and c<br>
are utilised for cleaning, the substrate, initially and after application of the first coating<br>
respectively and plasma regions b and d are utilised to for the applications of coatings using<br>
atomised liquid or solid coating forming materials in accordance with the process of the present<br>
invention via an atomiser (not shown). The atomiser is retained above the plasma regions b and<br>
d and relies upon gravity for the atomised liquid or solid to enter the its respective plasma region<br>
b and d. windows 47 49 and 51 are provided using glass to enable the operator to view the<br>
formation and operation of the plasma formed between the electrodes which is useful when<br>
problems within the assembly occur.<br>
[0059]	It is to be appreciated that any suitable electrode system may be utilised and that<br>
the system described above is used merely for example.<br>
Example: Multilayer Coating on Polypropylene Film<br>
[0060]	As an example of the potential utility of the present invention there is provided<br>
the following example in which a 25 μm thick polypropylene film was coated twice using the<br>
apparatus in accordance with the present invention. The first coating was a hydrophilic<br>
polyacrylic acid coating, the second coating being an oleophobic and hydrophobic<br>
fluoropolymer coating. A KSV CAM200 Optical Contact Angle Meter was used to characterise<br>
i)	The untreated film which is hydrophobic but not oleophobic<br>
ii)	the acrylic acid treated film (i) and<br>
iii)	the fluoropolymer treated film (ii)<br>
by sessile drop contact angle.<br>
The untreated polypropylene film is hydrophobic but not oleophobic, as shown in<br><br><br>
[0061]	The film is then coated using the described atmospheric pressure glow<br>
 discharge (APGD) apparatus. The operating conditions used were the same for the<br>
application of both coatings Both pairs of electrodes used were made from a steel mesh and<br>
were adhered to a glass dielectric plate. The distance between the glass dielectric plates<br>
attached to the two electrodes was 6mm and the surface area thereof was (10cm x 60cm).<br>
The process gas used was helium. The plasma power to both zones 0.4kW, voltage was 4kV<br>
and the frequency was 29 kHz. The operating temperature was below 40° C. The substrate<br>
was passed through both the first and second plasma zones using a reel to reel mechanism of<br>
the type described in Fig. 3 with a guide means being utilised to assist in the transport of the<br>
substrate out of the first and into the second plasma regions. The speed of the substrate<br>
passing through both plasma zones was 2m min-1.<br>
Application of acrylic acid coating<br>
[0062]	The substrate was transported through a first plasma region in which it is<br>
activated by means of an atmospheric pressure glow discharge using helium as the process gas.<br>
Upon leaving the first plasma region the guide was utilised to direct the activated substrate into<br>
the second plasma zone into which an acrylic acid precursor is introduced via Sonotec<br>
ultrasonic nozzle into the coating zone at a rate of 50 μl min-1. Contact angle analysis was<br><br>
undertaken on the resulting coated substrate and the results thereof are provided in Table 2<br>
below. It will be noted that the hydrophilicity of the resulting coated substrate has significantly<br>
increased.<br><br>
Application of Fluoropolymer<br>
[0063] 	The second coating was applied in a similar fashion, with the first plasma zone<br>
being utilised to activate the surface and the second plasma zone being used to further coat the<br>
substrate with a layer of heptadecafluorodecyl acrylate. Contact angle analysis of the resulting<br>
coated film is presented in Table 3. The resulting double coated polypropylene substrate is now<br>
both hydrophobic and oleophobic.<br><br><br>
