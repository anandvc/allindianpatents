Among the tetrakisazo dyes of the invention are preferred those in which Z signifies a radical of formula (a), especially those of formula (lb), and particularly preferred are also their mixures with trisazo dyes of formula (X).<br>
The diazotization and coupling reactions may be carried out in a manner conventional per se. Diazotization may e.g. be carried out with a nitrite (preferably sodium nitrite) in acidic aqueous medium (preferably in the presence of hydrochloric acid) and at low temperatures, e.g. in the range of-5°C to +10°C, preferably 0 to 5°C. The coupling reaction of the diazonium compounds to the respective coupling components is advantageously carried out at temperatures in the range of -5°C to +30°C, preferably below 25°C, more preferably in the range of 0 to 10°C. The coupling of the diazo compound of an amine of formula (VIII) to a middle component of formula (IX) may be carried out under distinctly acidic to strongly basic pH-conditions, e.g. at a pH in the range of 4 to 12, preferably 5 to 11. The selective coupling of a bisdiazo compound of a diamine of formula (II) or (VI) at one side to the 3-position of a compound of formula (III) is suitably carried out under distinctly acidic conditions, e.g. at a pH in the range of 1 to 5, preferably by adding an aqueous solution of a compound of formula (III) of a nearly neutral pH (e.g. pH in the range of 6 to 8, preferably 6.5 to 7.5) into the acidic solution, in which the diazotization has been carried out and that contains the diazonium compound.<br>
The coupling of the monoazodiazo compound to a coupling component H-Bj or H-B2 may be carried out at any pH as suitable for coupling to the respective coupling component, preferably at pH values below 10, in particular in the range of 4 to 8.5, more preferably under nearly neutral conditions, in particular at pH-values in the range of 6 to 7.5 and at temperatures, e.g. in the range of-5°C to +30°C, preferably 0 to 25°C.  The coupling of a diazo compound of an amine of formula (V) to the 6-position<br><br>
of a compound of formula (IV) is preferably carried out under mildly basic to nearly neutral pH-conditions, e.g. at a pH in the range of 6 to 9, preferably 6.5 to 8 and under temperatures preferably in the range of 0 to 25°C. These pH and temperature conditions are also suitable for the selective coupling of the bisdiazocompound of a bisamine of formula (II) or (VI) at one side to the 6-position of a disazo compound of formula (VII). The coupling of the trisazodiazocompound to a coupling component H-Bi or H-B2 may be carried under conditions as described above for the coupling of the monoazodiazo compound. By using a suitable base for pH-adjustment (preferably alkali metal hydroxide, e.g. sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide, more preferably sodium hydroxide), the dyes may be obtained in a suitable salt form of high hydrosolubility. If desired, they may be obtained in another salt form, e.g. by precipitation by means of acidification and then conversion to another salt form by addition of a suitable base.<br>
The synthetized dyes may be purified, if desired, in any manner conventional QSL SS, e.g. by precipitation (e.g. by salting out or by acidification with a strong mineral acid) and filtration and optionally re-precipitation and filtration, and/or by microfiltration and, optionally, ultra-filtration. Where desired, the dye solution may be fiirther purified and/or concentrated by means of suitable membrane filtrations. The purified dye solutions may be dried to dye-pow^der or -granulate.<br>
The dye may, upon isolation or dialysis, be blended with suitable blending agents conventional pec sg, e.g. alkali metal salts (sodium carbonate, sodium sulphate) non-electrolyte blending agents (mainly oligosaccharides, e.g. dextrine) or/and with surfactants (e.g. as suitable as wetting agents), in particular non-ionic and/or anionic surfactants. There may e.g. be mentioned hydrocarbon sulphonates, sulphon-ated castor oil, sulphosuccinates, lignin sulphonate, hydrophilic polysaccharide derivatives, ethoxylated alkylphenols or fatty alcohols. If a surfactant is employed the weight ratio of the surfactant to the dye is advantageously in the range of 5:95 to 40:60. If desired, especially if the composition contains a surfactant, as indicated above, it may be formulated with water as a liquid concentrated dye-composition, preferably with a dry-substance content in the range of 10 to 70 %, more preferably 20 to 50 % by weight, referred to the weight of the composition.<br>
The dyes of the invention are, in general, of dark hues, in particular ranging from green to red hues, e.g. bluish black, reddish black or greenish black, and/or deep black.<br>
The tetrakisazo dyes of the invention are anionic dyes and are suitable for dyeing substrates dyeable with anionic dyes.<br><br>
Any substrate that is dyeable with anionic dyes is suitable as a substrate that may be dyed with the azo dyes of the invention; these include natural and regenerated cellulose, polyurethanes, basically modified high polymers (e.g. basically modified polypropylene), natural or synthetic polyamides or anodized aluminium, in particular, however, leather substrates. The substrate to be dyed may be in any conventional form, e.g. in the form of loose fibers, filaments, yams, woven or knitted goods, non-woven webs, carpets, half-ready-made and ready-made soft goods and tanned leather or pelts. The dyes may be employed in any desired concentration up to the saturation of the substrate. The dyeing may be carried out by any conventional methods that are suitable for the substrate to be dyed, e.g. by exhaustion or impregnation methods (e.g. padding, spraying, foam application or application with a roller, or printing), preferably from aqueous medium; for synthetic substrates, the dye may optionally also be incorporated into the synthetic mass. Paper may be dyed in the pulp or after sheet formation.<br>
The dyes of the invention are, however, mainly suitable for the dyeing of leather and pelts.<br>
Any kinds of leather which are conventionally dyed from aqueous medium are suitable, particularly grain leather (e.g. nappa from sheep, goat or cow and box-leather from calf or cow), suede leather (e.g. velours from sheep, goat or calf and hunting leather), split velours (e.g. from cow or calf skin), buckskin and nubuk leather; further also woolen skins and flirs (e.g. fiir-bearing suede leather). The leather may have been tanned by any conventional tanning method, in particular vegetable, mineral, synthetic or combined tanned (e.g. chrome tanned, zirconyl tanned, aluminium tanned or semi-chrome tanned). If desired, the leather may also be re-tanned; for re-tanning there may be used any tanning agent conventionally employed for re-tanning, e.g. mineral, vegetable or synthetic tanning agents [e.g. chromium, zirconyl or aluminium derivatives, quebracho, chestnut or mimosa extracts, aromatic syntans, polyurethanes, (co)polymers of (meth)acrylic acid compounds or melamine/, dicyanodiamide/ and/or urea/formaldehyde resins]. Thus leathers of very high to very low affinity for anionic dyes may be used.<br>
The leathers may be of various thicknesses, thus, there may be used very thin leathers, such as book¬binder"s leather or glove-leather (nappa), leather of medium thickness, such as shoe upper leather, garment leather and leather for handbags, or also thick leathers, such as shoe-sole leather, furniture leather, leather for suitcases, for belts and for sport articles; hear-bearing leathers and fiirs may also be used. After tanning (in particular after a re-tanning) and before dyeing, the pH of the leather is ad¬vantageously set to values in the range of 4 to 8 (the leather is "neutralized"); depending on the kind of the leather, there may be chosen an optimum pH range, e.g. for grain leather pH values in the range of 4 to 6, for suede leather and split velours and for very thin leathers pH-values in the range of 4.5 to 8, for<br><br>
intermediately dried suede leathers and intermediately dried split velours the pH may range in the scope of 5 to 8. For the adjustment of the pH-value of the leather there may be employed conventional assistants; for tanned leather of acidic character the pH may be adjusted by addition of suitable bases, e.g. ammonia, ammonium bicarbonate or alkali metal salts of weak acids, e.g. sodium formate, sodium acetate, sodium bicarbonate, sodium carbonate or sodium sulphite, of which sodium formate and sodium bicarbonate are preferred. Sodium carbonate and sodium bicarbonate are usable in particular as second bases for the exact adjustment of the superficial pH-value of the leather. Mineral tanned leather may, if desired, also be masked, e.g. with alkali metal formate, oxalate or polyphosphate or e.g. with titanium/potassium oxalate.<br>
The dyeing may be carried out in a manner known |2er S£ suitably in an aqueous medium and under conventional temperature and pH conditions, in particular in the temperature range of 20 to 80°C, pre¬ferably 25 to 70°C, milder temperature conditions, in particular in the range of 25 to 40°C, being pre¬ferred for the achievement of deeper penetrations and for the dyeing of wool-bearing skins and furs. The pH-values of the dye-bath may, in general, range broadly, mainly from pH 8 to pH 3; in general the dyeing may be advantageously begun at higher pH-values and concluded at lower pH-values. Preferably the dyeing is carried out at pH-values &gt; 4, in particular in the pH-range of 8 to 4, and for the conclusion of the dyeing procedure the pH-value is lowered (e.g. by addition of an acid conventional in the leather dyeing technique such as acetic acid or formic acid) preferably to values in the range between 4 and 3. The dye concentration may range broadly, if desired, up to the saturation degree of the substrate, e.g. up to 5 %, referred to the wet weight of the substrate. The dyeing may be carried out in one or more stages, e.g. in two stages, optionally with insertion of charge reversal of the substrate by means of conventional cationic assistants.<br>
The dyes of the invention may, if desired, be employed in combination with conventional dyeing assistants, mainly non-ionic or anionic products (in particular surfactants, preferably hydrophilic poly¬saccharide derivatives, polyoxyethylated alkylphenols or alcohols, lignosulphonates or sulpho group-containing aromatic compounds).<br>
A fatting may, if desired, be carried out before and/or after the dyeing process, in particular also in the same liquor. For fatting after the dyeing process the fatting agent is advantageously added before the pH of the liquor is lowered, preferably to values between 3 and 4.<br>
For the fatting (in particular fat-liquoring) step there may be used any conventional natural animal, vegetable or mineral fat, fat oil or wax, or chemically modified animal or vegetable fat or oil, which<br><br>
include in particular tallow, fish oils, neats-foot oil, olive oil, castor oil, rapeseed oil, cottonseed oil, sesame oil, com oil and Japanese tallow, and chemically modified products thereof (e.g. hydrolysis, transesterification, oxidation, hydrogenation or sulphonation products), bees-wax, Chinese wax, camauba wax, montan wax, wool fat, birch oil, mineral oils with boiling range within 300 and 370°C (particularly the so-called "heavy alkylates"), soft paraffin, medium paraffin, vaseline and methyl esters of Ci4.22-fatty acids; and synthetic leather fatting agents, including esters, in particular partial esters of polybasic acids (e.g. phosphoric acid) with optionally oxyethylated fatty alcohols. Of the above mentioned the methyl ester, the sulphonation products and the phosphoric acid partial esters are particularly preferred. By the term "sulphonation" for the fatting agents, there is meant generally the introduction of the sulpho group including also the formation of a sulphato group (= "sulphating") and the introduction of a sulpho group by reaction with a sulphite or SO2 (= "sulphiting").<br>
A conventional leather softener, in particular a cationic leather softener may, if desired, be applied in a final step, particularly if fatting has been carried out with a sulphonated fat-liquoring agent.<br>
The treated substrate may then be further treated in conventional manner, e.g. rinsed or washed, drained, dried and cured.<br>
According to the invention there may be obtained azodyes that display, even with a relatively low number of hydrosolubilizing substituents in Wj, W2, D, Bj or B2, a high solubility in water, especially where the anionic dyes are in alkali metal salt form; they are distinguished by their stability to electrolytes (in particular inorganic ions), specifically also to bases and acids, and are also distin¬guished, especially on leather, by their build-up and a high degree of insensitivity to variations of the affinity of the leather towards anionic dyes, very level dyeings of outstanding penetration and high colour-yield being obtainable. In these leather-dyeing properties the dyes of formulae (Ic) and especially (lb) excel over those of formula (la) and are, thus, preferred. According to a particular feature of the invention and with a view to these properties, they may advantageously be employed also in a form substantially ft"ee of other elektrolytes, as obtainable by dialysis.<br>
The dyeings, particularly on leather, have excellent fastness properties, for example wet-fastnesses, fastness to rubbing, light-fastness and stability to PVC-migration. They are readily combinable with other dyes, in particular such with similar tinctorial behavior. There may be obtained very level, intense, fine dyeings, grain side and velours side being very evenly dyed, the shade of the dyeings on different kinds of leather being equal or very similar; in admixture with corresponding compatible dyes with which the dyes of the invention are combinable, in particular with the above trisazo dyes of<br><br>
formula (X), there may also be obtained very intense and regular dyeings of high yield and optimum fastnesses. By the choice of the substituents some of the properties of the dyes (e.g. solubility, shade, build-up, penetration, levelness etc.) may be varied accordingly. The polyazodyes of the invention, especially the preferred ones, are also well combinable with trisazo or other tetrakisazo dyes, there being obtainable very homogeneous shades and penetrations and regular dyeings of optimum fast¬nesses, also light fastness.<br>
In the following Examples parts and percentages are by weight. The temperatures are indicated in degrees Celsius. In the Application Examples the respective dyes are used in blended form containing 30 % of the respective dye and the blending agent being Glauber"s salt (sodium sulphate), the other products employed in the Application Examples are commercially available products conventional in the treatment of leather.<br>
