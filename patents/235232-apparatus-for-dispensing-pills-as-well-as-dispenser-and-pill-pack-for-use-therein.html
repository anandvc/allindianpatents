Apparatus for dispensing pills, as well as dispenser and pill-pack for use therein<br>
The invention relates to an apparatus for dispensing pills comprising at least one pill package and a dispenser.<br>
The patent literature includes a great many publications relating to pocket dispensers with pill packages. Examples thereof are: US-A-4,667, 845; US-A-3,651, 927; EP-A-0 807 589; FR-A-2 538 791; US-A-5,409,132; US-A-4,015,717.<br>
Such an apparatus comprising a pocket dispenser and pill package is also known from international patent application WO 97/08078 of applicant. In this prior art apparatus, the means for the stepwise rotatable positioning of the pill package in the form of a blister pack are mounted on both parts of the dispenser, whilst the blister pack is in non-rotatable engagement with one of said parts, as a result of which it is carried along upon rotation thereof.<br>
The object of the invention is to further improve the known apparatus.<br>
In order to accomplish that objective, the invention provides an apparatus for dispensing pills comprising at least one ring-shaped pill package, in which cavities containing pills are so distributed that the openings of the cavities therein are directed outwardly, as well as a flat pocket dispenser comprising a first part for receiving the pill package in a ring shape, a second part fitting on said first part, which envelops the pill package together with the first p'art, which first part and/or which second part comprise(s) at least one passage opening with which a pill to be dispensed can be aligned, and a push-out means, which can be positioned in line with the respective pills in the pill package and with the passage opening and which can be operated for pushing out the pill to be dispensed through the passage opening, wherein means are provided for rotatably positioning the pill package stepwise relative to the part of the apparatus including the push-out means, characterized in that the pill package itself<br><br>
and the part of the dispenser that includes the push-out means comprise means for the stepwise positioning of the pill package.<br>
By mounting the means for the stepwise positioning of the pill package directly on the pill package itself, one source of inaccuracies in the positioning of the pill package relative to the push-out means is eliminated. The fact is that it has become apparent that it is very important that the cavity containing the pill to be dispensed be accurately positioned in line with the push-out means in order to ensure that the pill is ejected from the cavity and, in cases where a blister pack is used as the pill package, through the covering foil in a reliable manner. This plays a role in particular when the dimensions of the apparatus are to be reduced. The small dimensions impose restrictions on the stroke of the push-out means, the ejection force, the blister size and the like.<br>
In order to achieve a further enhancement of the accuracy, said means are fitted with a biassing element, which eliminates the play in said means that are imposed by the production process to one side.<br>
In one possible embodiment, said means comprise teeth formed on the respective part of the dispenser and a spring tooth formed on the pill package, wherein the biassing element preferably comprises a second tooth which is spaced from the former tooth in circumferential direction by a distance which slightly deviates from {a multiple of) the pitch of the teeth on the dispenser.<br>
When said means and said biassing element are formed on the pill package, they can be used not only for positioning the pill package in the dispenser, but also, in the case of a holder containing a blister pack, for positioning the blister pack correctly relative to the holder during production.<br>
In order to further improve the ejection performance of the push-out means, the outwardly extending free end of said push-out means is bevelled, such that each cavity is loaded off-centre upon ejection of a pill.<br><br>
Surprisingly, it has become apparent that when the cavity of a blister pack is loaded in this manner, the pill can be ejected from the cavity in a controlled manner, without peaks in the development of force which might have a negative influence on the ejection movement. Furthermore, the average ejection force will remain low.<br>
According to another aspect of the invention, the push-out means can be operated by means of the operating element, wherein the push-out means and the operating element are in one piece, albeit in the form of two parts interconnected by a film joint, whilst the part of the dispenser that supports the operating element includes means for imposing the pivoting movement.<br>
When such a push-out means and such an operating element are used, both the movement of the operating element and that of the push-out means can be selected at will without any additional parts being reguired.<br>
Another advantageous aspect of the invention is the fact that the blister pack may be provided with means, which may for example be visible through the passage opening, for providing an indication as to the contents of the cavity in the blister pack that is positioned in line with the passage opening. Said means may for example consist of a colour code, which indicates whether or not, in the case of an anti-conception pill, the omission to take a pill involves a risk of conception.<br>
The invention will be explained in more detail hereafter with reference to the drawings, wh,ich schematically show an embodiment of the invention.<br>

Fig. 12 is a perspective bottom plan view of a pill package for use in the dispenser of Fig. 11.<br>
The drawing shows an embodiment of an apparatus for dispensing pills comprising a pocket dispenser 1 intended for repeated use and a pill package, in this case in the form of a disposable blister pack 2. In the illustrated embodiment, the pills in the blister pack 2 are anti-conception pills, one package containing 28 such pills. The dispenser can also be used for other pills, of course.<br>
Blister pack 2 comprises a body having a plurality of cavities 3 for receiving one pill P each (in this embodiment). In this embodiment, cavities 3 are covered by a frangible foil F (see Figs. 1, 9 and 10), such that when a force is exerted on cavity 3 containing pill P, the pill can be pushed out through the frangible foil. In the illustrated embodiment, the blister pack 2 is accommodated in a holder 4   (see also Fig. 6) in a ring shape, such that foil F is disposed on the outer side of said ring and pill P can be ejected from the blister pack 2 from the inside, therefore.<br>
Holder 4 may be formed in one piece with blister pack 2, or be joined to blister pack 2, for example by bending a rectangular blister pack 2 into a ring shape and subsequently<br><br>
attaching holder 4 or individual parts thereof to blister pack 2. Preferably, this is done as part of the manufacturing process. Holder 4 makes it very easy to place blister pack 2 into dispenser 1, whilst holder 4 may furthermore add functionality to the blister pack 2.<br>
As is shown in particular in Fig. 1, the dispenser 1 comprises a lower, cup-shaped part 5 and a cover-like upper part 6 to be placed on top of said part 5. The two parts 5, 6 have mating edges, which make it possible to snap upper part 6 onto lower part 5 so as to close dispenser 1, wherein the upper part 6 remains rotatable relative to the lower part 5. The circumferential edge of upper part 6 projects beyond the circumference of lower part 5 (see Figs. 3 and'4)   in order to make it easier to handle the dispenser for rotating it. The two parts 5 and 6 are substantially annular, having an opening in their centres and a circular circumference. Dispenser 1 is furthermore relatively flat, so that it can be readily carried along in a bag or in a pocket.<br>
The lower part 5 of dispenser 1 has a passage opening 7 in its circumferential wall for ejecting a pill from dispenser 1, to which end the lower part 5 is also provided with a push-out means -8 comprising an operating element or button 9, which will be discussed in more detail yet.<br>
In order to eject pills P, it must be possible to rotate the blister pack 2 stepwise relative to the lower part 5, such that a new cavity 3 containing a pill P can be placed between the push-out means 8 and the passage opening 7 each time, so that a pill can be ejected by the push-out means 8 upon actuation of the operating element 9.<br>
According to the invention, holder A  of the blister pack 2 and the lower part 5 of the dispenser are to this end fitted with mating positioning means. The means of the lower part 5 consist of teeth 10, which are formed on the outer circumference of an elevation 11 on the bottom of lower part 5 (see Figs. 1-3), whilst the means present on holder 4 consist of at least substantially radially opposed teeth 12 and 13, which are formed on spring arms 14 and 15,<br><br>
respectively, so that the teeth 12 and 13 .can move resiliently in radial direction and thus snap between the teeth 10 on the dispenser so as to hold the blister pack in a predetermined position relative to the lower part 5 of dispenser 1. The number of teeth 10 corresponds to the number of cavities 3 in the blister pack 2, so that a new cavity 3 can be positioned before the passage opening 7 upon movement of teeth 12 and 13 to a next position. Teeth 10 are not formed symmetrically, but the flank located on the side of the correct direction of rotation is less steep, thus making rotation in the correct direction easier than rotation in the opposite direction or even making rotation in the wrong direction altogether impossible.<br>
As is shown in Fig. 7, teeth 12 and 13 of holder 4 are not positioned exactly diametrically opposite each other, that is, the circumferential distance between teeth 12 and 13 does not exactly correspond to a multiple of the tooth pitch (in this case 180°), as a result of which the two teeth 12 and 13 will not engage exactly centrally between two teeth 10 at any time, but one of the teeth 12, 13 will abut against the sloping tooth flank of an adjacent tooth 10, thus exerting a force in circumferential direction on blister pack 2, as a result of which the play that is present is compensated. In the embodiment wherein the blister pack 2 is to be joined with holder 4, the teeth 12 and 13 can also be used as positioning means during manufacture or assembly for joining blister pack 2 and holder at the correct circumferential angle.<br>
Holder 4 and the upper part 6 of dispenser 1 also include positioning means for non-rotatably interconnecting the upper part 6 and the blister pack 2 in several positions, so as to be able to rotate holder 4 and blister pack 2 with respect to the lower part 5 of dispenser 5 by means of upper part 6. To this end a short, outwardly extending flanged edge 16 including a number of notches n corresponding to the number of cavities 3 in blister pack 2 (Figs. 1, 6 and 1)   is formed on the upper edge of holder 4 of blister pack 2. The upper part 6 of dispenser 1 includes one or more projections,<br><br>
four in this case, which fit(s) in notches. 17 (Fig. <j . the position of upper part relative to blister pack is determined by day on which first pill p taken whereby indication or date that present transparent placed at wherein various pills are numbered pack. there several possible ways providing as manufacturing process design must be such can easily aligned with pills. this makes it easier check whether not associated particular has already been taken.></j>
Preferably, the foil F of blister pack 2 is provided with an indication, preferably a colour code, which indicates whether or not the omission to take the pill present in the associated cavity in time involves a risk of conception. In the present case, the foil of blister pack 2 will have a clearly recognizable colour or colours, for example red, which is visible through the passage opening 7 at the location of cavities 3 containing active pills P, whilst the foil will for example be green at the location of cavities 3 containing pills to be taken on days that the omission to take one involves only a small risk of conception, or none at all. In this way a user is immediately alarmed or reassured, as the case may be, when she has forgotten to take a pill.<br>
In order to place the blister pack 2 into the lower part 5 of dispenser 1 in the correct manner, such that the first pill to be taken will be aligned with passage opening 7, the annular bottom of holder A   of blister pack 2 is provided with a recess 19 in its inner circumference (see Figs. 2 and 1),   which must be positioned on elevation 11 on the bottom of lower part 5 at the location of an attachment 20 (Fig. 1) in order to be able to place blister pack 2 into the lower part 5 of the dispenser 1.<br>
In order to ensure that the blister pack 2 is rotated in the correct direction from this starting position, so as to<br><br>
start the correct sequence of pills, a sloping lip 21 is formed in the bottom of holder 4 (Figs. 2 and 7), which lip extends obliquely downwards from one side in the circumferential direction and which engages in a recess 22 (Fig. 3) in the bottom of lower part 5 in the starting position of blister pack 2. When the upper part 6 of dispenser 1 containing the blister pack 2 is rotated in the wrong direction, the free end of lip 21 will strike against the radial wall of recess 22, thus preventing rotation in that direction whilst enabling rotation in the opposite, correct direction, because the spring lip 21 is lifted from recess 22 as a result of the wedge shape. In other positions, however, it is possible to rotate blister pack 2 back, for example when blister pack 2 has been rotated too far, because the free end of lip 21 will then slide across the smooth bottom of the lower part 5 of the dispenser.<br>
Figs. 8, 9 and 10 show the push-out means 8 and the operating element 9 of Fig. 1 and the operation thereof. Push-out means 8 is guided to be moved radially in the lower part 5 of dispenser 1 by means of elevation 11 on the bottom of lower part 5 and the attachment 20 mounted thereon, which is in the shape of an inverted U and which engages over a guide web 23 of push-out means 8. Push-out means 8 is integrally connected and integrally formed with the operating element 9 via a film hinge 24,   which is formed on the lower inward end of push-out means 8 and on the lower end of operating element 9. Operating element 9 comprises a connecting web 25 and a pressure surface 26 on the upper end thereof, which pressure, surface 26 can for example be operated with a thumb. The operating element 9 will thereby pivot about a film hinge 27 present on the front outward end of pressure surface 26. Said film hinge 27 allows pivoting movement relative to a mounting element 28, which is capable of hooking into a cooperating receiving element 29 present on top of the web of attachment 20 so as to secure mounting element 28 in position and pivotally connect operating element 9. Operating element 9 is spring-loaded towards its upper position of rest by a spring member, in this<br><br>
case  a  helical  compression  spring  30,   whose_lower  end surrounds  a  cam  31   on  the bottom of   lower part   5   of dispenser 1   and whose  upper  end butts   against   the  underside  of pressure surface  26  of  operating  element   9.<br>
Push-out means   8   is  fitted  with  an ejector nose  32 for  ejecting pills   P,   which  nose   fits  in  passage  opening  7, which slightly tapers  off in  the ejecting direction and which includes  a  sloping  ejection  surface   33,   which  is  capable of engaging each cavity  3 of blister pack 2  off-centre and of deforming  cavity  3  by pressure,   pushing the pill   P that  is present  in  cavity  3  outwards  through  foil  F and  subsequently out   of  the  dispenser  1  through passage opening  7.   Cavity  3  can be  easily deformed,   without   force  peaks,   by loading the cavity 3   off-centre with  a  sloping  ejection  surface  33,   as a result of  which the pill   P present   in  cavity  3  can be  ejected  in  a controlled manner,   which  leads  to pills  P being  dispensed  in  a reliable manner.   As  a  result of  the  accurate  positioning of the  blister pack  2  relative  to  the   lower part  5  of  dispenser  1 by means  of  teeth  10  and teeth  12,   13,   a cavity  3  will be accurately positioned at  the  same place before  the ejector nose  32  of push-out means  8   at  all  times,   so  that  each cavity 3   is  identically  loaded by  the ejection  surface   33  and dispensing  of  pills  takes  place   in  a  constant manner.  Thus,   a reliable  operation  of  the  apparatus   is  obtained.<br>
Push-out  means  8  and operating  element   9 may be shaped such that  a  transmission  ratio higher  than  one is obtained,   in which case  a movement  of operating  element  9  will result  in  a  greater movement  of push-out means  8.   This enables a  further reduction of the size of the dispenser.   Due to the advantageous ejection behaviour and the relatively low ejection  forces  that are  required,   the  large transmission ratio does  not  lead to uncomfortably  large operating  forces  on operating element  9.<br>
Figs.   11  and  12  show another variant  of  the dispenser 1   and the  pill  package  2  according  to the  invention,   wherein means   for   the   stepwise positioning   of   the pill   package   2 relative   to   the   lower  part   5   of   the   dispenser   1   are<br><br><br>
Fig. 1- The embodiment of Figs. 11 and 12 also comprises two spring teeth or fingers, 34 and 35 in this embodiment, and teeth 36, but the spring teeth 34, 36 are mounted on the lower part 5 of dispenser 1, whilst teeth 36 are formed on pill package 2. The operation is essentially the same as that of the embodiment described before.<br>
From the foregoing it will be apparent that the invention provides an apparatus for dispensing pills which is remarkable for its simplicity and compact construction comprising a minimum number of components whilst providing a reliable operation.<br>
The invention is not restricted to the above-described embodiment as shown in the drawings, which can be varied in several ways without departing from the scope of the invention. Thus it is for example possible to leave out the attachment 20 in the lower part 5 of the dispenser 1 and to form the receiving element 29 and the guide for the push-out element 8 on lower part 5. In that case, the pill package may be a disposable package other than a blister pack. The operating element and the push-out means may also consist of two interlocking parts, for example parts which are snapped together.<br><br><br>
