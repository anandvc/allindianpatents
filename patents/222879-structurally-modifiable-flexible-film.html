				<td>STRUCTURALLY MODIFIABLE FLEXIBLE FILM<br>
The invention relates to a structurally modifiable flexible film for forming dimensionally and<br>
structurally stable articles, in particular disposable containers.<br>
Disposable containers are known obtained from sheets of strong, generally plastic-coated<br>
paper, which are unwound from reels and subjected to successive bonding, folding and possibly<br>
shaping processes to assume the desired spatial configuration. Their filling with liquid, granular or<br>
powdery products can take place either during the container formation or after it has been completely<br>
formed.<br>
These known disposable containers are advantageous in terms of their stability, stackability,<br>
display on shelves, strength, product protection, ease of preservation, use and facility for reclosure.<br>
They are however rather heavy and costly, and difficult to dispose of as they are not easy to crumple.<br>
Flexible disposable containers are also known, obtained from plastic film, for example polyethylene,<br>
which are essentially free of the drawbacks of rigid containers; in particular they are of low cost, of<br>
smaller bulk and easy disposal, and simple, practical and advantageous to machine-fabricate starting<br>
from reels. However they have practically no dimensional stability and are therefore not easy to<br>
stack, and moreover from the commercial viewpoint present limitations in that they are unsuitable for<br>
display on shelves.<br>
In order to eliminate these drawbacks of the different types of known containers while at the<br>
same time preserving their advantages, and more precisely to form articles, and in particular<br>
disposable containers, which present dimensional stability while at the same time being of low cost<br>
and easy to reduce in bulk after use, a method has been proposed by the same applicant.<br><br>
This method has proved extremely valid, and in particular has enabled articles and especially<br>
disposable containers to be formed from a flexible film which prior to the formation of the article can<br>
be wound on a reel and can hence occupy a considerably reduced space, to be then stiffened only at<br>
the moment of formation of the article.<br>
The present invention proposes to provide a structurally modifiable film, to be used in<br>
particular in the aforeindicated known method, as an alternative to the flexible film used therein.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a structurally modifiable flexible film comprising<br>
at least one flexible layer associated over at least a part of its area with a stiffening system<br>
comprising at least a substance, such as herein described, which is liquid when applied to said<br>
flexible layer, but is subsequently thickened by a first transformation process, without the layer losing<br>
its features of flexibility and of being wound, and is caused to be stiffened by administration of<br>
energy in a second transformation process.<br>
Some preferred embodiments of the invention are further clarified hereinafter by way of non-<br>
limiting example.<br>
In a first embodiment, the structurally modifiable flexible film is a film 2 formed from several<br>
layers joined together by a traditional process of bonding by rolling or extrusion. One of these layers<br>
is formed from a traditional flexible film, for example of polyethylene, polypropylene, polyester,<br>
aluminium, paper or the like. Another of these layers is formed from a filmable substance able to<br>
undergo two different structural transformations, the first of which (stage A) takes place either<br>
spontaneously or by administration of energy, for example heat, during the film bonding process and<br>
transforms the substance into a state which enables the multi-layer film to be worked, the second<br>
transformation being effected later on command (stage B) by administrating a particular type of<br>
energy. Specifically, the administered energy can be light (with its spectrum for e.g. in the UV range),<br><br>
ultrasound, electron beam, thermal (with a triggering temperature higher than for<br>
the first stage), etc.<br>
The transformable substance can involve the whole or part of the surface of the<br>
traditional flexible film; in the first case it can be applied by spreading or by<br>
spraying, or can form a film to be bonded to the traditional flexible film; in the<br>
second case the transformable substance can be applied by stamping. In all<br>
cases the multi-layer film 2 is flexible and can be worked, wound onto a reef and<br>
stored, in a similar manner to a traditional flexible film.<br>
The transformable substance can advantageously be a mixture of several<br>
polymers, for example a system formed from photo-crosslinkable unsaturated<br>
polyester resins and one or more thickening agents, or from an unsaturated epoxy<br>
resin and an anhydride, or from unsaturated polyester and diisocyanate, or from a<br>
polyol and a diisocyanate, or from an epoxy resin, a diacrylate and a diisocyanate,<br>
or from a polyurethane adhesive and an acrylic system, or from a vinyl varnish and<br>
an acrylic system or the like, in which in the first stage there is a polymerization<br>
reaction between the two different resins which can lead to the formation of a<br>
polymeric cross-linkage, or polymerization of molecules of the same resin can<br>
occur, or "thickening" can take place by coordination of several molecules about a<br>
coordination centre to hence ensure workability of the film, whereas rn the second<br>
stage final stiffening takes place.<br>
The transformable system is generally provided with components at least one of<br>
which has double bonds; the system could also be provided with an activator<br>
(photoinitiator, thermal activator, catalyst).<br>
After the film 2 has been obtained, at the moment in which it is to be used<br>
for example to obtain a substantially rigid article or a container 4 it is subjected to<br><br>
energy administration of a type compatible with the nature of the transformable<br>
substance, so that it becomes transformed from flexible to substantially rigid.<br>
The energy administration can take place at any moment and in any form,<br>
depending also on the article to be obtained, For example, if the article to be<br>
obtained consists of cladding for a body having its own form, for example cladding<br>
for a panel, after the flexible multi-layer film has been applied to the panel the<br>
energy must be administered to the entire surface of said panel.<br>
If however the article to be dad consists of a pantographed panel or a<br>
convex body (for example the arm of an armchair), the multi-layerfilm should be of<br>
extendable type in order to adhere perfectly to the body without forming folds or<br>
overlaps, and again the energy must be administered to the entire surface of said<br>
panel.<br>
Finally, if the article to be obtained consists of a container 4, for example<br>
of bag type, which has to be stiffened only at its corners, the transformable<br>
substance can be applied either only to those bands of the multi-layer film which<br>
are to form the container corners, or to the entire surface of the film. In the first<br>
case the energy can be administered to the entire surface of the film, whereas in<br>
the second case it must be applied with masking, i.e. it must involve only those<br>
bands which are to form the container corners.<br>
In a different embodiment the structurally modifiable flexible film is a<br>
single-layer film in the form of a flexible film of at least partly porous material, for<br>
example paper or non-woven fabric, which is impregnated with the transformable<br>
substance. In this manner a composite material is obtained formed from a single<br>
layer in which the impregnant constitutes the matrix and the film the reinforcement<br>
filler; by a first transformation this material is brought into a condition in which it<br><br>
can be worked and handled, and by the second transformation, implemented on<br>
command, it becomes substantially rigid.<br>
The substances used in this second embodiment are such as to ensure<br>
that the film is not sticky even when in its form preceding final stiffening, and can<br>
be for example urethane acryfates dispersed in water or dissolved in a solvent,<br>
unsaturated polyesters, acrylates with various terminations, or others.<br>
In a variant of this embodiment, the single-layer transformable film can be<br>
bonded to traditional flexible films to form a multi-layer film, in which at feast one<br>
layer has the property of undergoing two different transformations, the second of<br>
which enhances its mechanical properties.<br>
In a third embodiment the substance which stiffens on command also has<br>
extrudability characteristics, and in this manner it can be extruded alone to form<br>
the structurally modifiable flexible film, or can be coextruded with a filmable<br>
polyotefin.<br>
In this fatter case the stiffening substance effects the first transformation<br>
during the extrusion stage, to be transformed into flexible film, whereas the second<br>
transformation, which determines stiffening, is triggered on command following<br>
administration of energy in the form required by the system.<br>
In both the aforesaid cases in which the stiffening substance is of flexible<br>
type, it evidently involves the entire surface of the structurally modifiable film of the<br>
invention, and consequently if the transformation is to involve only defined regions<br>
of the film, energy administration must necessarily take place with masking.<br>
A fourth embodiment of the structurally modifiable flexible film represents<br>
an intermediate solution between the aforegoing. According to this fourth<br>
embodiment, the flexible film is of multi-layer type, i.e. it is formed from several<br>
layers, one of which is a traditional flexible film to which the stiffening substance is<br><br>
applied, as described relative to the first embodiment, and at least one other layer<br>
of the multi-layer film consists of or contains stiffening material. Hence in this case<br>
the energy administration must take place over more than one layer and will<br>
enable the effect to be emphasised or selective, depending on whether the<br>
substances used are identical or different.<br>
A fifth embodiment of the structurally modifiable flexible film consists of a<br>
traditional flexible film on which there is deposited a cross-linkable polymer which<br>
is in the solid state at ambient temperature and is diluted in a suitable solvent for<br>
its application. In this case the first transformation stage consists of evaporating<br>
the solvent, followed by possible bonding of the flexible film to a second film to<br>
obtain a workable and windable multi-layer film; final stiffening of the multi-layer<br>
film takes place by cross-linking the polymer with or without activator, as a result of<br>
energy administration (for example electron beam, or UV if a photoinitiator is<br>
present).<br>
A sixth embodiment of the structurally modifiable flexible film uses as the<br>
stiffening substance to be applied to a traditional flexible film a mixture of two<br>
radical polymerization polymers, one of which is in the liquid state, other being in<br>
the solid state (physical thickening). In this case the polymer in the solid state, in<br>
particular in the powder state, becomes suspended in the polymer in the liquid<br>
state, the suspension having a consistency such as to enable it to be spread by<br>
traditional methods; the first transformation is thermal and results rn solubilization<br>
of the solid polymer in the liquid polymer, creating a considerable viscosity<br>
increase in the system; the second transformation is the cross-linkage of at least<br>
one of the two polymers, resulting in final stiffening of the plastic film. The<br>
substances which can be used in this case are solid polyester and liquid polyester,<br>
at least one of them unsaturated, solid diacrylate and liquid diacrylate or crossed<br><br>
systems. This system could present the advantage of very rapid thickening<br>
without being too critical regarding the resin specifications.<br>
A seventh embodiment of the structurally modifiable flexible film consists<br>
of applying to a traditional film a system formed from a two-component<br>
polyurethane adhesive and expandable microbeads. In this case the first<br>
structural transformation stage is the formation of the polyurethane adhesive<br>
followed by adhesion between the matrix, film and microbeads, whereas the<br>
second stage consists of expansion of the microbeads as a result of thermal<br>
energy administration. In its turn the volume increase consequent on the<br>
microbead expansion determines a stiffness increase in those parts of the film in<br>
which the microbeads are present.<br>
In a variant of thrs embodiment the microbeads are incorporated into a<br>
system which cross-links following administration of equal or different types of<br>
energy, or into one of the two-stage stiffening systems already described. In this<br>
case the first transformation is the thickening of the system containing the<br>
microbeads, whereas the transformation for final stiffening comprises expansion of<br>
the microbeads and cross-linkage of the system which contains them, so<br>
improving the final result obtained.<br>
An eighth embodiment of the structurally modifiable flexible film consists of<br>
inserting into a dual-cure organic resin a filler in the form of nanoparticles which<br>
form a "nanocomposite" resulting in increase in the elastic modulus of the resin<br>
and hence of the multi-layer film. In order for the nanoparticles to provide a<br>
significant contribution to the mechanical properties of the film they must be<br>
bonded to the resin, and to obtain a good bond between the filler and matrix the<br>
nanoparticles must be functionalized with organic groups compatible with the resin<br>
used so that chemical bonds form between the particles and the matrix. The<br><br>
particles used are preferably of inorganic nature and can be of natural origin, such<br>
as montmorillonite, or can originate from chemical synthesis (for example of<br>
alkoxysilanes), or can be formed from a hybrid; they could be coated with a<br>
polymer matrix in order to bond to the compatible part of the resin with which they<br>
form the nanocomposite.<br>
A ninth embodiment of the structurally modifiable flexible film is based on<br>
the use of a hybrid system formed from an inorganic part and an organic part,<br>
possibly reinforced with nanoparticles. In this case there is the synergic effect of<br>
the combination of the organic part, ensuring film flexibility, with the inorganic part,<br>
determining significant increases in the elastic modulus. Finally the presence of<br>
nonoparticles enables a nanocomposite material to be formed which further<br>
increases film stiffness. In this case the nanopartrcles used can be organic-<br>
inorganic hybrids to form bonds with the organic part of the matrix or with the<br>
inorganic part.<br>
Independently of the method by which the structurally modifiable flexible<br>
film is obtained, it can be worked, wound on a reel and stored, and is usable in<br>
current packaging machines.<br>
When all or part of the flexible film is to be stiffened, energy must be<br>
supplied in the form and intensity required by the system, in order to trigger the<br>
final transformation resulting in the stiffening of the scheduled parts of the film.<br><br>
