This invention relates to a process for making glass matrix ceramic composites for manufacturing bonded abrasives and abrasive articles made with them.<br>
Glass matrix-ceramic composites are used in bonding electronic components and for preparing bonded abrasive articles. Distribution of ceramic phase uniformly and evenly throughout the glassy matrix is one of the essential requirements of good quality glass matrix-ceramic composites. Grinding ratio and property of bonded abrasive articles are determined by grain holding capability and the rate of fracture of grain from the bond used in bonded abrasive articles.<br>
Grinding wheels having alumina abrasives with frit as bonding materials has been disclosed in US patent specification 4898597. Part of the frit has also been replaced with materials such as clay. GB patent no. 572700 discloses the use of borosilicate glass as bonding material. EP 0636457 and the US patent no.5863308 disclose other improvements in the field of bonds for abrasives.<br>
Abrasive articles made with the existing composite bonding material show the following drawbacks.<br>
When frit is used in the bonding material premature fracture of the grains is noticed which is attributed to the brittle nature of frit. This lowers the grinding ratio and hence the life of the grinding wheel. Addition of clay in the frit improves the bonding strength but formation of crystalline muUite phase is limited at the conventional firing temperature of around 1300°C of the grinding wheel. Though addition of nucleants such as Ti02, ZrO2, and MgO2 enhances the formation of crystalline phase, makes maintenance of nucleation and growth temperature difficult.<br><br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide a novel process of making glass matrix ceramic composite for manufacturing bonded abrasives which obviate the drawbacks described herein above. Yet another object of this invention is directed to the formation of ceramic phase such as mullite, alumina, magnesium-aluminate spinal, yttrium aluminum garnet at considerably lower temperatures in the glassy matrix at the grinding wheel.<br>
Glass matrix-composite produced by this process has uniform distribution of the ceramic phase throughout the glass matrix. Grinding ratio and hence the life of the abrasive articles made with the glass matrix-ceramic composite according to this invention are found to be considerably higher than those made with the hitherto known abrasive bonds. Glass matrix composite according to this invention has less thermal expansion coefficient than other glass bonded composites.<br>
Glass powder is added to an aqueous solution containing Al+3, Si+4', Mg+2, Y+3 ions either alone or in combination to form a slurry under constant stirring pH of the slurry is raised in the range of 7.5 to 10.5 by passing ammonia gas or by the addition of liquor ammonia, which results in gel formation. This gel is filtered and washed after aging and the filtered mass is ground, sieved and then calcined at a temperature ranging from 600'C to 1450°C.<br>
Abrasive articles are prepared by adding known abrasive materials such as alumina to the glass matrix ceramic composite along with any known temporary binder composition. The mixture is moulded in the desired shape, subjected to uniaxial pressing and then dried to obtain the abrasive article.<br><br>
A process for making glass matrix ceramic composite according to this invention comprises the steps of preparing a slurry of glass powder in an aqueous solution of metal salts containing Al+3, Si+4 Mg+2, Y+3, Zr+4 ions either alone or in combination, increasing the pH of said slurry to form a gel, separating the gel from said aqueous mixture, drying, calcining and grinding the same to obtain the glass matrix ceramic composite.<br>
This invention also includes a glass matrix ceramic composite when made by the process described herein above.<br>
The process for preparing an abrasive article according to this invention comprises the steps of preparing an admixture of a known abrasive material with the glass matrix composite prepared by the process as herein before described along with a known temporary bonding material, shaping and molding said admixture drying said shaped and molded article and subsequently firing the same to obtain said abrasive article.<br>
This invention also relates to an abrasive article prepared by a process as described herein above. Water soluble aluminium salts such as aluminum nitrate and aluminum chloride may be used in a concentration ranging from 0.5 to 5.0 (N). Other salts capable of being used are magnesium nitrate, magnesium chloride, yttrium nitrate, yttrium chloride, sodium silicate, silicon chloride and zirconium oxychloride preferably in the concentration ranging from 0.5 to 5.0 (N).<br>
Preferably the weight percentage of ceramic phase in the glass matrix may be in the range of 1 to 50%.<br><br>
For the preparation of abrasive articles, any known abrasive such as silicon carbide, aluminum oxide, sol-gel alumina, cubic boron nitride (CBN), diamond, zirconia, silicon nitride, zirconium toughened alumina, and tungston carbide either<br><br>
conventional manner. The abrasive article obtained by this method show better grinding ratio and have longer life span.<br>
In a specific embodiment glass powder is mixed with an aqueous solution of the selected metal sah under stirring liquor ammonia is poured into the suspension to raise the pH to the range of 7.5 to 10.5. Gel like mass produced is their aged for about 24 hours and then filtered, washed and calcined at a temperature in the range of 350°C to 950°C. This mass is then ground to the desired mesh size preferably 200 mesh B.S., which is then sieved and heated to a temperature of 600°C to 1450C.<br>
