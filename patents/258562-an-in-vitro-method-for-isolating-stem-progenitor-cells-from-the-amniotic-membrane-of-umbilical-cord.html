				<td>EOLATION OF STEM/PROGENITOR CELLS FROM AMNIOTIC MEMBRANE OF UMBILICAL<br>
CORD<br>
[0001] The present invention relates to a method for isolating<br>
stem/progenitor cells from the amniotic membrane of umbilical cord, wherein<br>
the method comprises separating the amniotic membrane from the other<br>
components of the umbilical cord in vitro, culturing the amniotic membrane<br>
tissue under conditions allowing cell proliferation, and isolating the<br>
stem/progenitor cells from the tissue cultures. In particular, the invention relates<br>
to the isolation and cultivation of stem cells having embryonic properties such<br>
as epithelial and/or mesenchymal stem/progenitor cells under conditions<br>
allowing the cells to undergo mitotic expansion. Furthermore, the invention is<br>
directed to a method for the differentiation of the isolated stem/progenitor cells<br>
into epithelial and/or mesenchymal cells and therapeutic uses of these<br>
stem/progenitor cells:<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002] Stem cells are a cell population possessing the capacities to selfrenew<br>
indefinitely and to differentiate in multiple cell or tissue types. Embryonic<br>
stem cells (from approximately days 3 to 5. after1 fertilisation) proliferate<br>
indefinitely and can differentiate spontaneously into all tissue types: they are<br>
"thus termed plurfpotent stem cells (reviewed, for example, in Smith, A.G. (2001)<br>
Annu. Rev. Cell. Dev. BioL 17, 435-462). Adult stem cells, however, are more<br>
tissue-specific and may have less replicative capacity: they are thus termed<br>
muttipotent stem cells (reviewed, for example, in Paul, G. et al. (2002) Drug<br>
Dlscov. Today 7, 295-302). The "plasticity" of embryonic and adult stem cells<br>
relies on their ability to trans-differentiate into tissues different from their origin<br>
and, perhaps, across embryonic germ layers.<br>
[0003] The ability of stem cells to self-renew is critical to their function as<br>
reservoir of primitive undifferentiated cells. In contrast, most somatic cells have<br>
a limited capacity for self-renewal due to telomere shortening (reviewed, for<br>
example, in Dice, J.F. (1993) Physiol. Rev. 73, 149-159). Stem cell-based<br>
therapies thus have the potentfal to be useful for the treatment of a multitude of<br>
human and animal diseases.<br>
[0004] Stem cells as well as stem/progenitor cells can be derived from<br>
different sources. The "multi-lineage" potential of embryonic and adult stem<br>
cells has been extensively characterized. Even though the potential of<br>
embryonic stem cells is enormous, their use implies many ethical problems.<br>
Therefore, non-embryonic stem cells derived from the bone marrow stroma, fat<br>
tissue, dermis and umbilical cord blood have been proposed as alternative<br>
sources. These cells can differentiate inter alia into chondrocytes, adipocytes,<br>
osteoblasts, myoblasts, cardiomyocytes, astrocytes, and tenocytes in vitro and<br>
undergo differentiation in vivo, making these stem cells - in general referred to<br>
as mesenchymai stem cells - promising candidates for mesodermal defect<br>
repair and disease management.<br>
[0005] In clinical use, however, harvesting of such mesenchymai stem<br>
cells causes several problems. The collection of the cells is a mental and<br>
physical burden to the patient as a surgical procedure is required to obtain the<br>
cells (for example, the collection of bone marrow is an invasive technique<br>
performed with a biopsy needle that requires local or even general anesthesia).<br>
Furthermore, in many cases the number of stem cells extracted is rather low.<br>
More importantly, no epithelial cells are derived or differentiated from these<br>
cells. This prompted the search for other possible sources of stem cells.<br>
[0006] Umbilical cord blood has been identified as a rich source of<br>
haematopoetic stem/progenitor cells. However, the existence of mesenchymai<br>
stem/progenitor cells is discussed controversially. On the one hand, such cells<br>
could not be isolated or successfully cultured from term umbilical cord blood<br>
(Mareschl, K. et al. (2001) Haematologlca 86, 1099-1100). At the same time,<br>
results obtained by Campagnoli, C. et al. (Blood (2001) 98, 2396-2402) as well<br>
as Erices, A. et al. (Br. J. Haematol. (2000) 109, 235-242) suggest that<br>
mesenchymai stem cells are present in several fetal organs and circulate in the<br>
blood of pre-term fetuses simultaneously with hematopoietic precursors.<br>
Accordingly, International Patent Application WO 03/070922 discloses isolation<br>
and culture-expansion methods of mesenchymai stem/progenitor cells from<br>
umbilical cord blood and a differentiation method of such cells into various<br>
mesenchymai tissues. Isolation efficiencies of about 60% have been reported<br>
(Bieback, K. et al. (2004) Stem Cells 22, 625-634). In the same study, both the<br>
time period from collection of the umbilical cord blood to isolation of the cells<br>
and the volume of the blood sample used have been determined as crucial<br>
parameters for achieving such a yield. However, it is still a matter of debate<br>
whether these stem/progenitor cells are indeed derived of umbilical cord tissue.<br>
[0007] Recently, mesenchymal stem/progenitor cells have been<br>
successfully isolated from umbilical cord tissue, namely from Wharton's jelly, the<br>
matrix of umbilical cord, (Mitchell, K.E. et al. (2003) Stem Cells 21, 50-60; U.S.<br>
Patent 5,919,702; US Patent Application 2004/0136967). These cells have<br>
been shown to have the capacity to differentiate, for example, into a neuronal<br>
phenotype and into cartilage tissue, respectively. Furthermore, mesenchymal<br>
stem/progenitor cells have also been isolated from the endothelium and the<br>
subendothelial layer of the umbilical cord vein, one of the three vessels (two<br>
arteries, one vein) found within the umbilical cord (Romanov, Y.A. et al. (2003)<br>
Stem Cells 21, 105-110; Covas, D.T. et al. (2003) Braz. J. Med. Biol. Res. 36,<br>
1179-1183).<br>
[0008] However, none of these approaches employed thus far has<br>
resulted in the isolation or cultivation of epithelial stem/progenitor cells as a<br>
source for epithelial cell-based therapies such as skin resurfacing, liver repair,<br>
bladder tissue engineering and other engineered surface tissues. Thus, there is<br>
still a need for methods and reliable sources useful for the isolation and<br>
cultivation of epithelial stem/progenitor cells. Furthermore, rapid and efficient<br>
methods which are ethically acceptable and do not pose a biomedical burden<br>
on the patient for the isolation of epithelial and mesenchymal stem/progenitor<br>
cells are still required in order to provide such cells in a sufficient amount for<br>
various applications in regenerative medicine and tissue engineering.<br>

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
[0017] The invention will be better understood with reference to the<br>
detailed description when considered in conjunction with the non-limiting<br>
examples and the drawings, in which:<br>
[0018]Figure 1 depicts'epithelial cell outgrowth from umbilical cord<br>
amniotic membrane by the method of direct tissue explant (40 x magnification)<br>
at day 2 (Fig. 1A) and day 5 (Fig. 1B, C) of tissue culture. Cell culture plastic<br>
surfaces were coated with collagen 1/collagen 4 mixtures (1:2; Becton<br>
Dickinson) before placing the amniotic membrane on the surface. The amniotic<br>
membrane specimens were submerged in 5 ml EpiLife medium or Medium <br>
(both from Cascade Biologies). Medium was changed every 2 or 3 days and cell<br>
outgrowth by explant was monitored under light microscopy. Microphotographs<br>
were taken at different time intervals as stated above. The observed polyhedral<br>
cell morphology is typical of epithelial cells.<br>
[0019] Figure 2 depicts enzymatic digestion of the umbilical cord<br>
segments yielding similar epithelial (40 x magnification) cells at day 2 (Fig. A,<br>
C) and day 5 (Fig. B, D). Umbilical cord amniotic membrane was divided into<br>
small pieces of 0.5 cm x 0.5 cm and digested in 0.1% (w/v) collagenase type <br>
solution (Roche Diagnostics) at 37°C for 8 hours. The samples were vortexed<br>
every 30 min for 3 min. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4000 rpm for<br>
30 min. Cell pellets were resuspended in EpiLife medium or Medium 171 (both<br>
from Cascade Biologies) supplemented with 50 ug/ml insulin-like growth factor-<br>
1 (IGF-1), 50 jig/ml platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB), 5 ug/ml<br>
transforming growth factor-£1 (TGF-£1) and 5 jag/ml insulin (all obtained from<br>
R&amp;D Systems), counted and seeded on 10 cm tissue culture dishes pre-coated<br>
with collagen 1/coIlagen 4 mixtures (1:2; Becton Dickinson) at density of 1 x 106<br>
cells/dish. After 24 hours, attached cells were washed with warm .phosphate<br>
buffered saline (PBS) and the culture medium was replaced with EpiLife<br>
medium or Medium 171 (both from Cascade Biologies). The medium was<br>
changed every 2 OF 3 days, and cell outgrowth was monitored under light<br>
microscopy. Microphotographs were taken at different time intervals as stated<br>
6<br>
above. Once again the cells demonstrated typical epithelial ceil polyhedral<br>
morphology.<br>
[0020] Figure 3 depicts outgrowing mesenchyma! cells explanted from<br>
umbilical cord amniotic membrane. Cellular outgrowth was observed as early<br>
as 48 hours after placement in tissue culture dishes using DMEM supplemented<br>
with 10% fetal calf serum (PCS) as culture medium (40 x magnification) (Fig.<br>
3A, C). The explants were submerged in 5 ml DMEM (Invitrogen) supplemented<br>
with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone) (DMEM/10% FBS). Medium was<br>
changed every 2 or 3 days. Cell outgrowth was monitored under light<br>
microscopy. Microphotographs were taken at different time intervals. The cells<br>
were characterized by their spindle shaped morphology, and migrated and<br>
expanded both easily and quickly in vitro, closely resembling fibroblasts (Fig.<br>
3B, D).<br>
[0021] Figure 4 (40 x magnification) depicts mesenchymal cells from<br>
umbilica! cord amniotic membrane cells isolated by collagenase enzymatic<br>
digestion. Fig. 4A shows mesenchymal cells isolated from umbilical cord<br>
amniotic membrane at day 2. Cell proliferation was observed at day 5 (Fig. 4B).<br>
Umbilical cord amniotic membrane was divided into small pieces of 0.5cm x<br>
0.5cm and digested in 0.1% (w/v) collagenase typel solution (Roche<br>
Diagnostics) at 37°C for 6 hours. The samples were vortexed every 15 min for 2<br>
min. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4000 rpm for 30 min. Cell pellets<br>
were resuspended in DMEM/10% FBS, counted and seeded on 10cm tissue<br>
culture dish at density of 1 x 106 cells/dish. Medium was changed every 2 or 3<br>
days. Cell outgrowing was monitored under light microscopy. Microphotographs<br>
were taken at different time intervals. Once again, cells demonstrated spindle<br>
shaped morphology typical of mesenchymal cells as fibroblasts.<br>
[0022] Figure 5 (40 x magnification) depicts the morphology in serumfree<br>
culture condition (DMEM) and serum culture condition (DMEM/10%FCS) of<br>
umbilical cord amniotic membrane mesenchymal cells (UCMC, Fig. 5E, F, G, H)<br>
isolated according to the method of the invention, normal dermal fibroblasts<br>
(NF109 cells, Fig. 5A, B) and adipose-derived mesenchymal cells (ADMC, Fig.<br>
5C, D). Fig. 5 shows changes in cell morphology of NF and ADMC cultured in<br>
serum starvation conditions (DMEM only) reflected by flatter cells and less<br>
dense cytoplasm as compared with serum rich conditions (DMEM/10%FCS)<br>
where cells are more rounded with a dense cytoplasm (Fig. 5A, B, C, D). No<br>
change in morphology was observed in both UCMC groups cultured under<br>
identical conditions of serum-free vs. serum rich media (Fig. 5E, F, G, H),<br>
indicating a difference in behavior and physiology of these latter mesenchymal<br>
cells.<br>
[0023] Figure 6 (40 x magnification) depicts UCMC isolated according to<br>
the invention cultured in DMEM/10%FCS at days 3 and 7 without a 3T3 feeder<br>
layer. The cells are seen to be growing well, and are forming a colony (vertical<br>
growth) Instead of exhibiting radial spread. Once again, this indicates a<br>
difference in behavior of these mesenchymal cells as compared to their more<br>
differentiated counterparts.<br>
[0024] Figure 7 (40 x magnification) depicts colony formation of<br>
umbilical cord epithelial cells (UCEC) cultured on a 3T3 feeder layer at days 3<br>
and 7. This appearance is similar to that of normal skin derived epithelial<br>
keratinocyte stem cells. In the latter, the 3T3 feeder layer maintains sternness of<br>
the cells.<br>
[0025] Figure 8 (40 x magnification) depicts obvious colony formation of<br>
umbilical cord mesenchymal cells (UCMC) isolated according to the invention<br>
cultured on a 3T3 feeder layer at days 3 and 7. The 3T3 feeder layer normally<br>
suppresses the growth of differentiated mesenchymal cells as human dermal<br>
fibroblasts. Once again, this indicates a difference in behavior of these<br>
mesenchymal cells as compared to their more differentiated counterparts.<br>
[0026] Figure 9-1 to Figure 9-27 show Western blot analysis by which<br>
the expression of several embryonic stem cell markers in UCEC and UCMC<br>
isolated according to the invention, was compared to the expression of these<br>
markers in human dermal fibroblasts (IMF), in bone marrow mesenchymal cells<br>
(BMSC) and adipose-derived mesenchymal cells (ADMC). Fig. 9 also shows<br>
highly secreted ActivinA and Follistatin detected by ELISA assay in<br>
supematants of umbilical cord mesenchymal and epithelial stem cell culture in<br>
comparison with bone marrow, adipose derived stem cells, human dermal<br>
fibroblasts and epidermal keratinocytes<br>
[0027] Figure 10 shows indirect immune-fluorescent analysis of markers<br>
of epithelial cells expressed in umbilical cord epithelial stem cells such as<br>
cytokeratins (CK)-general, CK17, CK6, CK10, CK19, CK18, CK16, CK15<br>
 (Fig.10-1); Hemidesmosome components-integrin alphas, integrin beta4;<br>
Desmosome- components (Fig.10-2); Basement membrane componentslarnininl,<br>
lamininS, collagen IV, collagen VII (Fig.10-3) and other important<br>
extracellular matrix components as integrin-betal and fibronectin (Fig.10-4).<br>
[0028] Figure 11 shows cytokine array analysis of secreted cytokines<br>
and growth factors by umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (UCMC) in<br>
comparison with human bone-marrow mesenchymal stem cells.<br>
[0029] Figure 12 shows cytokine array analysis of secreted cytokines<br>
and growth factors by umbilical cord epithelial stem cells (UCEC) in comparison<br>
with human epidermal keratinocytes.<br>
[0030] Figure 13. shows UCMC cells cultured in DMEM supplemented<br>
with 10 % fetal calf serum (PCS) (Fig.13-1), serum-free media PTT-1 (Fig.13-<br>
2), in serum-free media PTT-2 (Fig.13-3, Fig.13-4) and in serum-free media<br>
PTT-3 (Fig.13-5). Fig. 13 also shows the growth of adipose derived stromal<br>
cells (Fig.13-6) and bone marrow derived stromal cells (Fig.13-7) in serum free<br>
medium PTT-3.<br>
[0031] Figure 14 shows global gene expression in umbilical cord<br>
epithelial and mesenchymal stem cells analyzed by DNA microarray. UCEC<br>
expressed a total of 28055 genes and UCMC expressed a total of 34407 genes.<br>
There are 27308 overlapping genes expressing in both cell types. 747 genes<br>
expressed were unique to UCEC and 7099 genes expressed were unique to<br>
UCMC. The selected genes of interest are presented in this Figure. Both stem<br>
cell types expressed 140 genes related to embryonic stem cells and embryonic<br>
development.<br>
[0032] Figure 15 shows a schematic illustration of expansion of<br>
umbilical cord epithelial and mesenchymal stem cells using repetitive explants<br>
of umbilical cord lining membrane tissues.<br>
[0033] Figure 16 depicts a cross section of an umbilical cord<br>
demonstrating the umbilical cord amniotic lining membrane (LM), the contained<br>
Wharton's jelly (WJ), as well as two umbilical arteries (UA) and one umbilical<br>
vein (UV) supported within this jelly.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0034]The invention is based on the surprising finding that the amniotic<br>
membrane of umbilical cord represents a source, from which stem/progenitor<br>
cells such as mesenchymal and epithelial stem/progenitor cells can be<br>
successfully isolated and expanded under in vitro conditions. Even more<br>
surprising is the finding that these cells show embryonic stem cell-like<br>
characteristics. The amniotic membrane (also called amniotic lining membrane),<br>
i.e. thin innermost membranous sac enclosing the placenta and developing<br>
embryo of mammals,' has recently been used as a natural substrate in ocular<br>
surface reconstruction and as a biological substrate for expanding limbal<br>
epithelial stem cells (cf., e.g., Anderson, D.F. et al. (2001) Br. J. Ophthalmol. 85,<br>
567-575; Gruterich, M. et al. (2003) Surv. Ophthalmol. 48, 631-646). However,<br>
no methods have be'en described thus far for the isolation of stem/progenitor<br>
cells from the amniotic membrane, at least for humans, nor has the amniotic<br>
membrane covering the umbilical cord been reported as a source for stem cells.<br>
[0035] The invention provides a method for isolating stem/progenitor cells<br>
from the amniotic membrane of umbilical cord, the method comprising:<br>
(a) separating the amniotic membrane from the other components of<br>
the umbilical cord in vitro;<br>
(b) culturing the amniotic membrane tissue obtained in step (a) under<br>
conditions allowing cell proliferation; and<br>
(c) isolating the stem/progenitor cells.<br>
[0036]The term "stem/progenitor cell" as used herein refers to any cell<br>
derived of umbilical cord having the capacities to self-renew indefinitely and to<br>
differentiate in multiple cell or tissue types such as endothelial cells, epithelial<br>
cells, fibroblasts, myocytes or neurons. Furthermore, the cells may be derived<br>
of any mammalian species, such as mouse, rat, guinea pig, rabbit, goat, dog,<br>
cat, sheep, monkey or human, with cells of human origin being preferred in one<br>
embodiment.<br>
[0037] The term "embryonic stem cell-like properties" refers to the ability<br>
of the cells derived of umbilical cord that they can - almost like or exactly like<br>
embryonic stem cells - differentiate spontaneously into all tissue types, meaning<br>
that they are pluripotent stem cells.<br>
[0038] The term "amniotic membrane" as used herein refers to the thin<br>
innermost membranous sac enclosing the developing embryo of mammals.<br>
During pregnancy, the fetus is surrounded and cushioned by a liquid called<br>
amniotic fluid. This fluid, along with the fetus and the placenta, is enclosed<br>
within a sac called the amniotic membrane, which also covers the umbilical<br>
cord. The amniotic fluid is important for several reasons. It cushions and<br>
protects the fetus, allowing the fetus to move freely. The amniotic fluid also<br>
allows the umbilical cord to float, preventing it from being compressed and<br>
cutting off the fetus1 supply of oxygen and nutrients derived from the circulating<br>
blood within the placental blood vessels. The amniotic sac contains the amniotic<br>
fluid which maintains a homeostatic environment protecting the fetal<br>
environment from the outside world. This barrier additionally protects the fetus<br>
from organisms (like bacteria or viruses) that could travel up the vagina and<br>
potentially cause infection.<br>
[0039] Media and reagents for tissue culture are well known in the art<br>
(cf., for example, Pollard, J.W. and Walker, J.M. (1997) Basic Cell Culture<br>
Protocols, Second Edition, Humana Press, Totowa, NJ; Freshney, R.I. (2000)<br>
Culture of Animal Cells, Fourth Edition, Wiley-Liss, Hoboken, NJ). Examples of<br>
suitable media for incubating/transporting umbilical cord tissue samples include,<br>
but are not limited to, Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM), RPMI<br>
media, Hanks' Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS) phosphate buffered saline (PBS),<br>
and L-15 medium, with the latter one being preferred in some embodiments.<br>
Examples of appropriate media for culturing stem/progenitor cells according to<br>
the invention include, but are not limited to, Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium<br>
(DMEM), DMEM-F12, RPMI media, EpiLlfe medium, and Medium 171, with the<br>
latter being preferred in some embodiments. The media may be supplemented<br>
with fetal calf serum (PCS) or fetal bovine serum (FBS) as well as antibiotics,<br>
growth factors, amino acids, inhibitors or the like, which is well within the<br>
general knowledge of the skilled artisan.<br>
[0040]In one embodiment, the invention provides a method, further<br>
comprising:<br>
(a") separating these stem/progenitor cells from the amniotic<br>
membrane tissue by a enzymatic digestion and/or direct tissue explant<br>
technique before cultivation. The term "enzymatic digestion technique" as used<br>
herein means that enzymes are added to cleave the cells from the main tissue<br>
mass .(here the amniotic membrane of the umbilical cord). The separated cells<br>
are subsequently collected. The term "direct tissue explant technique" as used<br>
herein means that the tissue is first placed in media without enzymes. Then<br>
under careful conditions the cells separate from the main tissue mass by itselfand<br>
the cells are then harvested for collection.<br>
[0041] Methods for separating cells of a particular tissue or organ by<br>
treatment with enzymes or by direct tissue explant are well known in the art (cf.,<br>
for example, Pollard, J.W. and Walker, J.M. (1997) Basic Cell Culture Protocols,<br>
Second Edition, Humana Press, Totowa, NJ; Freshney, R.l. (2000) Culture of<br>
Animal Cells, Fourth Edition, Wiley-Liss, Hoboken, NJ). Any enzyme catalyzing<br>
tissue dissociation may be used for performing the methods of the present<br>
invention. In preferred embodiments, collagenase is used for that purpose. The<br>
enzyme may be used as a crude preparation or in purified form. It may be<br>
purified from any prokaryotic or eukaryotic organism (with Clostridium<br>
histolyticum being most preferred) or produced recombinantly by means of gene<br>
technology. Any type of collagenase may be employed, i.e. type 1, type 2, type<br>
3, type 4, or any combination thereof. In some embodiments the use of<br>
collagenase type 1 is being preferred.<br>
[0042] In one embodiment, the invention provides a method for isolating<br>
stem/progenitor cells that have embryonic stem cell-like properties. These cells<br>
can ultimately be differentiated into, but not limited to, by morphology, epithelial<br>
or mesenchymal cells.<br>
[0043]Accordingly, in another embodiment, the invention provides a<br>
method for isolating epithelial and/or mesenchymal stem/progenitor cells,<br>
wherein in accordance with the above disclosure these cells may have<br>
embryonic stem cell-like properties.<br>
[0044] Epithelial stem/progenitor cells include any cells exhibiting a<br>
epithelial cell like morphology (i.e. a polyhedral shape) that can be differentiated<br>
into any type of epithelial cell such as, but not limited to, skin epithelial cells,<br>
hair follicular cells, cornea epithelial cells, conjunctiva! epithelial cells, retinal<br>
epithelial cells, liver epithelial cells, kidney epithelial cells, pancreatic epithelial<br>
cells, oesophageal epithelial cells, small intestinal epithelial cells, large intestinal<br>
epithelial cells, lung and airway epithelial cells, bladder epithelial cells or uterine<br>
epithelial cells.<br>
[0045] Mesenchymal stem/progenitor cells include any cells exhibiting a<br>
mesenchymal cell like morphology (i.e. a spindle-like shape) that can be<br>
differentiated into any type of mesenchymal cell such as, but not limited to, skin<br>
fibroblasts, chondrocytes, osteoblasts, tenocytes, ligament fibroblasts,<br>
cardiomyocytes, smooth muscle cells, skeletal muscle cells, adipocytes, cells<br>
derived from endocrine glands, and all varieties and derivatives of<br>
neurectodermal cells.<br>
[0046] In another embodiment, the invention provides a method further<br>
comprising:<br>
(d) culturing the stem/progenitor cells under conditions allowing the<br>
cells to undergo clonal expansion.<br>
[0047]The term "clonal expansion" (sometimes also referred to as<br>
"mitotic clonal expansion") relates to a process that occurs early in the<br>
differentiation program of a cell, by which stem/progenitor cells become<br>
committed to a particular lineage and then undergo terminal differentiation. It is<br>
well known in the art that the conditions to induce clonal expansion of progenitor<br>
cells may vary significantly between different cell types. Without being limited to<br>
a particular method, the induction of clonal expansion is generally achieved by<br>
cultivating the stem/progenitor cells in a medium that has been optimized for<br>
cell proliferation. Such media are commercially available from many providers.<br>
Non-limiting examples of such media are KGM®-Keratinocyte Medium<br>
(Cambrex), MEGM-Mammary Epithelial Cell Medium (Cambrex), EpiLife<br>
medium (Cascade Biologies) or Medium 171 (Cascade Biologies). Alternatively,<br>
a culture medium may be supplemented with reagents inducing cell proliferation<br>
such as growth factors. Such reagents may be admixed in a single solution<br>
such as the Human Keratinocyte Growth Supplement Kit (Cascade Biologies),<br>
to name one example, or may be supplemented individually. Such reagents<br>
include, but are not limited to, growth factors (such as epidermal growth factor,<br>
insulin-like growth factor-1, platelet-derived growth factor-BB, transforming<br>
growth factor-^1, insulin, for example), hormones (such as a bovine pituitary<br>
extract), hydrocortisone, transferrin and the like in any suitable combination to<br>
induce clonal expansion of a given cell type. The term "clonal expansion" also<br>
includes cultivation of the cell in vivo, for example, by injection of the cells into<br>
mammals such as humans, mice, rats, monkeys, apes to name only a few.<br>
[0048]In yet another embodiment, the invention provides a method<br>
further comprising:<br>
(e) culturing the stem/progenitor cells under conditions allowing the<br>
differentiation of said cells into epithelial cells and/or mesenchymal cells; and<br>
(f) isolating the differentiated cells.<br>
[0049] In yet another embodiment, the invention provides a method,<br>
further comprising:<br>
(g) preserving the isolated stem/progenitor cells for further use.<br>
[0050] Methods and protocols for preserving and storing of eukaryotic<br>
cells, and in particular mammalian cells, are well known in the art (cf., for<br>
example, Pollard, J.W. and Walker, J.M. (1997) Basic Cell Culture Protocols,<br>
Second Edition, Humana Press, Totowa, NJ; Freshney, R.I. (2000) Culture of<br>
Animal Cells, Fourth Edition, Wiley-Liss, Hoboken, NJ). Any method maintaining<br>
the biological activity of the isolated epithelial or mesenchymal stem/progenitor<br>
cells may be utilized in connection with the present invention. In one preferred<br>
embodiment, the stem/progenitor cells are maintained and stored by using cryopreservation.<br>
[0051] Accordingly, the invention is also directed to a progenitor/stem<br>
cell derived from the amniotic membrane of umbilical cord by means of the<br>
above methods. In addition, the invention is also directed to a cell bank<br>
comprising or consisting of one or more progenitor/stem cells that have been<br>
isolated as described here. This cell bank of progenitor/ stem cells may be<br>
autologous to an individual or pooled, and subsequently can be employed by<br>
further differentiation for regenerative medicine, tissue repair and regeneration,<br>
for example.<br>
[0052] In accordance with the above, the invention is also directed to a<br>
pharmaceutical composition comprising a stem/progenitor cell isolated from the<br>
amniotic membrane of umbilical cord by the above inventive method. The<br>
pharmaceutical composition can be of any kind, and usually comprises the<br>
stem/progenitor cells or a cellular extract thereof together with a suitable<br>
therapeutically acceptable carrier/excipient. In some embodiments, the<br>
pharmaceutical composition is adapted for systemic or topical application.<br>
[0053] A pharmaceutical composition adapted for topical application may<br>
be in liquid or viscous form. Examples thereof include an ointment, a cream,<br>
and a lotion and the like. Examples for pharmaceutical compositions that are<br>
suitable for systemic use are liquid compositions, wherein the stem/progenitor<br>
cells or the cellular extract are dissolved in a buffer that is acceptable for<br>
injection or infusion, for example.<br>
[0054] Accordingly, the invention also relates to a method of treating a<br>
subject having a disorder. This method comprises administering to the subject<br>
an effective amount either of a stem/progenitor cell isolated as explained herein<br>
or of a cellular extract derived from such a cell.<br>
[0055] In principle, any condition which is suitable for being treated by<br>
means of stem cells/progenitor cells can be treated with a cell or a cellular<br>
extract of present invention. In some embodiments, the disorder is selected<br>
from the group consisting of neoplastic disease, accelerated skin aging and skin<br>
disorders, tissue disorders, visceral endocrine deficiencies, and neural<br>
disorders.<br>
[0056] The tissue disorder to be treated can be a congenital or an<br>
acquired tissue deficiency. Examples of visceral endocrine deficiency that can<br>
be treated with a cell of the invention include, but are not limited to, Diabetes<br>
mellitus associated with insulin deficiency, testosterone deficiency, anemia,<br>
hypoglycemia, hyperglycemia, pancreatic deficiency, adrenal deficiency, and<br>
thyroid deficiencies.<br>
[0057] Examples of neural disorders that can be treated include, but are<br>
not limited to, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's, disease, Jacob Kreutzfeld's<br>
disease, Lou Gehrig's disease, Huntington's disease and neural neoplastic<br>
conditions.<br>
[0058] An example of a skin disease is a wound or a damaged part of<br>
the skin, for example, sun burned skin. Also aging of the skin is considered to<br>
be a skin disease herein. Topical or similar delivery of stem/progenitor cells of<br>
the invention or cellular extracts thereof, for example, as a constituent in lotions<br>
or creams or any other suitable vehicle may thus be used for repair of sun<br>
damaged skin and in addition may slow also down the aging process of skin<br>
(anti-aging properties) by replenishing, and thus fortifying, deficient growth<br>
factors and related peptide elements, without which skin aging would be<br>
accelerated. The stem/progenitor cells may also migrate to injured regions of<br>
the body such as surface wounds to form the necessary required cellular<br>
elements necessary for the local reparative processes (cf. The Journal of<br>
Immunology, 2001, 166: 7556-7562; or International Journal of Biochemical<br>
and Cell Biology 2004; 36: 598-606.<br>
[0059] The neoplastic disease may be cancer, in particular as recent<br>
studies have demonstrated that stem cells may selectively target neoplastic<br>
tumor tissue (Journal of the National Cancer Institute 2004; 96 (21): 1593-1603)<br>
allowing for directed delivery of antineoplastic agents such as interferon to<br>
neoplastic foci. The cancer can be any kind of cancer, including those cancers<br>
that are able to form solid tumors, ranging from skin cancer to cancer of the<br>
internal organs. Examples of cancers to be treaded include, squamous cell<br>
carcinoma, breast ductal and lobular carcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma,<br>
nasopharyngeal carcinoma, lung cancer, bone cancer, pancreatic cancer, skin<br>
cancer, cancer of the head or neck, cutaneous or intraocular malignant<br>
melanoma, uterine cancer, ovarian cancer, rectal cancer, cancer of the anal<br>
region, stomach cancer, colon cancer, breast cancer, testicular cancer, uterine<br>
cancer, carcinoma of the fallopian tubes, carcinoma of the endometrium,<br>
carcinoma of the cervix, carcinoma of the vagina, carcinoma of the vulva,<br>
Hodgkin's Disease, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, cancer of the esophagus, cancer<br>
of the small intestine, cancer of the endocrine system, cancer of the thyroid<br>
gland, cancer of the parathyroid gland, cancer of the adrenal gland, sarcoma of<br>
soft tissue, cancer of the urethra, cancer of the penis, prostate cancer, chronic<br>
or acute leukemias, solid tumors of childhood, lymphocytic lymphoma, cancer of<br>
the bladder, cancer of the kidney or ureter, renal cell carcinoma, carcinoma of<br>
the renal pelvis, neoplasm of the central nervous system (CMS), primary CNS<br>
lymphoma, tumor angiogenesis, spinal axis tumor, brain stem glioma, pituitary<br>
adenoma, Kaposi's sarcoma, epidermoid cancer or any combination of such<br>
cancers, including disseminated (metastasising) forms thereof. In case of<br>
treatment of a neoplastic disease the umbilical cord amnion derived stem cells<br>
and/or their cellular extracts disclosed herein can be administered systemically<br>
both as a direct treatment and/or as a carrier vehicle. In the latter case of antineoplastic<br>
tumor therapy, the cells comprise an anti-neoplastic agent.<br>
[0060] In another pharmaceutical use, stem/progenitor cells of the<br>
present invention can be used for gene therapy. For this purpose, the cells can<br>
be transformed with a nucleic acid encoding the protein that is to be produced in<br>
the cells. The nucleic acid can be introduced into a cells of the invention using<br>
any of the various methods that are well known to the skilled person, for<br>
example, using a viral vector and/or a lipid containing transfection composition<br>
such as as IBAfect (IBA GmbH, Gottingen, Germany), Fugene (Roche),<br>
GenePorter (Gene Therapy Systems), Lipofectamine (Invitrogen), Superfect<br>
(Qiagen), Metafecten (Biontex) or those ones described in the PCT application<br>
WO 01/015755). In a related embodiment, the cells of the invention, after being<br>
transformed with a nucleic acid encoding a polypeptide of choice, can be used<br>
of recombinantly producing this polypeptide.<br>
[0061] As mentioned above, stem cell extracts are rich in a variety of<br>
growth factors and peptides that are relevant for normal tissue physiology. Such<br>
growth factors and/or peptides may be deficient in exposed parts of the body,<br>
such as the skin, which is the surface layer of all human beings protecting the<br>
body from external elements for the maintenance of internal homeostasis.<br>
Therefore in a further embodiment, stem/progenitor cells of the invention or<br>
cellular extracts thereof are suitable for the treatment and/or maintenance of<br>
internal homeostasis.<br>
[0062] In a further embodiment and in line with the above disclosure, the<br>
stem/progenitor cells of the invention can be used for the production of any<br>
biological molecule. The biological molecule can be, for instance, any molecule<br>
that is naturally produced in the cells or a molecule the coding nucleic acid of<br>
which has been introduced into the cells via recombinant DMA technology.<br>
Examples of molecules that can be produced by the cells of the invention<br>
include, but are not limited to, a protein such as a cytokine, a growth factor such<br>
as insulin-like growth factor (IGF), epidermal growth factor (EGF), transforming<br>
growth factor beta (TGF-beta), Activin A, a bone morphogenetic protein (BMP),<br>
PDGF or a hormone as insulin or erythropoietin or a transporter protein such<br>
transferrin, a peptide such a growth factor or hormone (e.g. luteinic hormone<br>
(LSH), follicle stimulating hormone (FSH)), a small organic molecule such as a<br>
steroid hormone, an oligo- or polysaccharide, for example, heparin or heparan<br>
suifate (cf., example WO 96/23003, or WO 96/02259 in this regard), a<br>
proteoglycan, a glycoprotein such as collagen or laminin, or a lipid, to name<br>
only a few.<br>
[0063] In a further aspect and in accordance with recent approaches<br>
(see, for example, Amit, M et al., Human feeder layers for human embryonic<br>
stell cells, Biol Reprod 2003; 68: 2150-2156), the stem/progenitor cells<br>
described here can be used as feeder layer for the cultivation of other<br>
embryonic stem cells, in particular human embryonic stem cells. In one of these<br>
embodiments the cells of the present invention are preferably of human origin,<br>
since using human cells as feeder layer minimizes the risk of contaminating the<br>
cell culture with animal-derived components such as animal pathogens or<br>
immunogens. In this respect, it is to be noted that the cells of the invention can<br>
be cultivated under serum free conditions. Accordingly, employing the cells as<br>
feeder layer and cultivating the cell culture under with serum free media as the<br>
one described herein later, or in Draper et al. (Culture and characterization of<br>
human embryonic stem cell lines, Stem Cells Dev 2004, 13:325-336) or in the<br>
International patent application WO 98/30679, for example.<br>
[0064] In this connection, it is noted that in transplantation surgery and<br>
cell-based therapy high quantities of low passage cells with a minimal<br>
proportion of senescent cells (i.e., large proportion of high quality cells) are<br>
crucial and are required to be derived within the shortest possible time during<br>
cell expansion. For example, mesenchymal stem cells from bone marrow and<br>
cord blood are low in quantity and therefore require expansion over many<br>
passages for a long period of time in order to achieve the sufficient number of<br>
cells required for cell transplant. The high passage cells however tend<br>
to deteriorate in quality and may lead to cell senescence or cancerous<br>
transformation.. It has been found here that high quantities of cells of the<br>
present invention can be obtained by low passage numbers using a repetitive<br>
explanation technique. The present invention thus also relates to a method of<br>
cultivating stem/progenitors cells of the invention, wherein this method<br>
comprises:<br>
Obtaining a tissue explant from the amniotic membrane of umbilical cord;<br>
Cultivating the tissue explant in suitable cultivation media and cultivation<br>
conditions over a suitable period of time,<br>
Optionally exposing the tissue explant to fresh cultivation media and<br>
continuing the cultivation under suitable conditions over a suitable period of time<br>
(cf., Fig. 15).<br>
[0065] The cultivation can be carried out in for as many cycles<br>
(passages) as wanted and be stopped once the desired number of cells has<br>
been obtained. Exposing the tissue explant to fresh cultivation can be carried<br>
out by removing the used cell cultivation medium from the vessel used for<br>
growing the cells and adding fresh media to that vessel.' Instead of replacing the<br>
media in the used vessel, exposing to fresh cultivation media can be achieved<br>
by transferring the tissue explant to a new vessel which is filled with cultivation<br>
media. The tissue explant used for cultivation/propagation of the cells can be<br>
obtained by any suitable method, for example by the "direct tissue explant<br>
technique" as explained above (in which the tissue is first placed in media<br>
without enzymes, and then under careful conditions the cells separate from the<br>
main tissue mass by itself- and the cells are then harvested for collection)..<br>
[0066] The cultivation of the tissue explants can be carried out in any<br>
media that is suitable for cultivation of mammal cells. Examples include the<br>
conventional and commercially available media that are given above with<br>
respect to the cultivation or the clonal expansion of the cells of the invention<br>
such as, but not limited to, KGM®-Keratinocyte Medium (Cambrex), MEGMMammary<br>
Epithelial Cell Medium (Cambrex) EpiLife medium (Cascade<br>
Biologies), Medium 171 (Cascade Biologies), DMEM, DMEM-F12 or RPMI<br>
media. The cultivation is typically carried out at conditions (temperature,<br>
atmosphere) that are normally used for cultivation of cells of the species of<br>
which the cells are derived, for example, at 37°C in air atmosphere with 5%CC&gt;2.<br>
In one embodiment, the cultivation is carried out using serum free, in particular<br>
bovine serum free media. The cultivation (in one passage) is performed for any<br>
suitable time the cells need for growth, typically, but by no means limited to, for<br>
about 1 to several days, for example to about 7 or about 8 days.<br>

EXAMPLES<br>
Example 1: Collection of umbilical cord tissue<br>
[0070] Umbilical cord tissue is collected immediately after delivery of the<br>
child. The specimen is rinsed clean and immediately transferred into a 500ml<br>
sterile glass bottle containing culture transport medium (L-15 medium<br>
supplemented with 50 lU/ml penicillin, 50 ng/ml streptomycin, 250 pg/ml<br>
fungizone, 50 jj,g/ml gentamicin; all reagents purchased from Invitrogen) prior to<br>
transport to the laboratory. In the laboratory, stem cell extraction is conducted in<br>
a laminar flow hood under sterile conditions. The specimen is first transferred to<br>
a sterile stainless steel tray. All remaining blood in the cord vessels is removed<br>
by multiple- syringing washes using warm phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)<br>
supplemented with 5 lU/ml heparin (from Sigma). Plain PBS without heparin is<br>
used in the final washes. The umbilical cord tissue specimen is then cut into<br>
pieces 2cm in length and transferred into 10 cm diameter cell culture dishes,<br>
where further washing and disinfection is performed with 70% ethanol followed<br>
by multiple washes using PBS containing an antibiotic mixture (50 lU/ml<br>
penicillin, 50 ug/ml streptomycin, 250 pg/ml fungizone, 50 ug/ml gentamicin; all<br>
purchased from Invitrogen) until the solution becomes clear.<br>
Example 2: Cell separation/cultivation<br>
[0071] Dissection of umbilical cord tissue is first performed to separate<br>
the umbilical cord amniotic membrane from Wharton's jelly (i.e. the matrix of<br>
umbilical cord) and other internal components. The isolated amniotic membrane<br>
is then cut into small pieces (0.5 cm x 0.5 cm) for cell isolation. Explant is<br>
performed by placing the pieces of umbilical cord amniotic membrane on tissue<br>
culture dishes at different cell culture conditions for isolation of either epithelial<br>
or mesenchymal stem cells.<br>
[0072] For mesenchymal cell separation/cultivation, the explants were<br>
submerged in 5 ml DMEM (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine<br>
serum (Hyclone) (DMEM/10% FBS) and maintained in a CO2 cell culture<br>
incubator at 37°C. The medium was changed every 2 or 3 days. Cell outgrowth<br>
was monitored under light microscopy. Outgrowing cells were harvested by<br>
trypsinization (0.125% trypsin/0.05% EDTA) for further expansion and cryopreservation<br>
using DMEM/10% FBS.<br>
[0073] For epithelial cell separation/cultivation, cell culture plastic<br>
surfaces were coated with collagen 1/ collagen 4 mixtures (1:2) before placing<br>
the tissue samples on the surface. The tissue samples were submerged in 5 ml<br>
EpiLife medium or Medium 171 (both from Cascade Biologies). The medium<br>
was changed every 2 or 3 days. Cell outgrowth from tissue culture explants was<br>
monitored under light microscopy. Outgrowing cells were harvested by<br>
trypsinization (0.125% trypsin/0.05% EDTA) using EpiLife medium or Medium<br>
171.<br>
[0074] For the enzymatic extraction method of cells, umbilical cord<br>
amniotic membrane was divided into small pieces of 0.5 cm x 0.5 cm and<br>
digested in 0.1% (w/v) collagenase typel solution (Roche Diagnostics) at 37°C<br>
for 6 hours. The samples were vortexed every 15 min for 2 min. Cells were<br>
harvested by centrifugation at 4000 rpm for 30 min. Two different approaches<br>
were employed to isolate either epithelial or mesenchymal stem cells.<br>
[0075] For isolation of epithelial stem cells, cell pellets were<br>
resuspended in EpiLife medium or Medium 171 (both from Cascade Biologies)<br>
supplemented with 50 jog/ml insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), 50 jog/ml<br>
platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB), 5jag/ml transforming growth<br>
factor-/?1 (TGF-£1), and 5 fig/ml insulin (all obtained from R&amp;D Systems),<br>
counted and seeded on 10 cm tissue culture dishes pre-coated with collagen<br>
1/coIlagen 4 mixtures (1:2; Becton Dickinson) at density of 1 x 106 cells/dish.<br>
After 24 hours, attached cells were washed with warm PBS and medium was<br>
replaced with supplement-added EpiLife medium or Medium 171. The medium<br>
was changed every 2 or 3 days. Cell growth and expanding clonal formation<br>
was monitored under light microscopy. At a confluence of about 70%, cells were<br>
sub-cultured by trypsinization (0.125% trypsin/0.05% EDTA) for further<br>
expansion and cryo-preservation.<br>
[0076] For isolation of mesenchymal stem cells, cell pellets were<br>
resuspended in DMEM/10% FBS, counted and seeded on 10 cm tissue culture<br>
dishes at density of 1 x 106 cells/dish. The culture medium was changed every 2<br>
or 3 days. Cell growth and expansion was monitored under light microscopy. At<br>
a confluence of about 90%, cells were sub-cultured as outlined above.<br>
[0077] For cultivation of epithelial and mesenchymal stem cells on<br>
feeder layer, umbilical cord lining membrane was digested by collagenase<br>
treatment, counted and seeded on 10cm tissue culture dishes coated with<br>
lethally irradiated or Mitomycin C treated 3T3 fibroblasts (feeder layer) in<br>
Green's medium. The culture medium was changed every 2 or 3 days. Colony<br>
formation was monitored under light microscopy and photographed.<br>
Example 3: Identification of stem/progenitor cells<br>
[OQ78]Epithelial cells: Fig. 1 shows pictures of outgrowing epithelial cells<br>
from umbilical cord amniotic membrane prepared by the method using tissue<br>
explant (40 x magnification). Pictures were taken at day 2 (Fig. 1A) and day 5<br>
(Fig. 1B, C) of tissue culture. Cell morphology analysis demonstrated<br>
polyhedral shaped epithelial-like cells. Enzymatic digestion of the umbilical cord<br>
segments yielded similar (Fig. 2), epithelial cells at day 2 (Fig. A, C) and day 5<br>
(Fig. B, D) (40 x magnification). Fig.7 shows pictures of colony formation of<br>
epithelial stem cells from umbilical cord amniotic membrane cultured on feeder<br>
layer using Green's method (40 x magnification). A colony of polyhedral shaped<br>
epithelial-like cells expanded rapidly from day 3 to day 7.<br>
[0079] Mesenchymal cells: Outgrowth of mesenchymal cells explanted<br>
from umbilical cord amniotic membrane was observed as early as 48 hours<br>
after placement in tissue culture dishes using DMEM supplemented with 10%<br>
fetal calf serum (PCS) as culture medium (Fig. 3A, C) (40 x magnification). The<br>
cells were characterized by their spindle shaped morphology, and migrated and<br>
expanded both easily and quickly in vitro, closely resembling fibroblasts (Fig.<br>
3B, D) (40 x magnification). Similar observations were noted in the cell group<br>
isolated by collagenase enzymatic digestion (Fig. 4). Fig. 4A shows<br>
mesenchymal cells isolated from umbilical cord amniotic membrane at day 2.<br>
Cell proliferation was observed at day 5 (Fig. 4B) (40 x magnification). Figures<br>
6 and 8 show pictures of colony formation of mesenchymal stem cells from<br>
umbilical cord amniotic membrane cultured on non-feeder layer and feeder<br>
layer condition in DMEM/10%FCS (40 x magnification). The colonies of<br>
elongated shaped fibroblastic-like cells expanded rapidly from day 3 to day 7.<br>
[0080] Western blot analysis (Fig.9) shows that mesenchymal stem cells<br>
from umbilical cord amniotic membrane (UCMC) and umbilical cord epithelial<br>
cells (UCEC) isolated in accordance with the invention expressed the POU5f1<br>
gene which encodes the transcription factor Octamer-4 (Oct-4) a specific<br>
marker of embryonic stem cells (cf. Niwa, H., Miyazaki, JM and Smith, A.G.<br>
(2000). Nat. Genet. 24, 372-376), Thus, this analysis indicates the embryoniclike<br>
properties of these stem cells. These cells also highly expressed the other<br>
growth factors such as connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), vascular<br>
endothelial growth factor (VEGF), placenta-like growth factor PLGF, STATS,<br>
stem cell factor (SCF), Hepatoma-derived Growth Factor (HDGF), Fibroblast<br>
Growth Factor-2 (FGF-2), Platelet-derived Growth Factor (PDGF), alpha-<br>
Smooth Muscle Actin (u-SMA), Fibronectin, Decorin, Syndecan-1,2,3,4. In Fig.<br>
9, the expression of these genes is compared to human dermal fibroblasts,<br>
bone marrow mesenchymal cells (BMSC) and adipose-derived mesenchymal<br>
cells (ADMC). Fig. 9 also shows highly secreted Activin A and Follistatin (both<br>
of which proteins are well known to promote tissue repair and regeneration,<br>
enhanced angiogenesis, and maintain embryonic stem cell culture, so that<br>
expression of the respective genes is a sign for the embryonic properties and<br>
ability of the cells to differentiate) detected by ELISA assay in supematants of<br>
umbilical cord mesenchymal and epithelial stem cell culture in comparison with<br>
bone marrow, adipose derived stem cells, human dermal fibroblasts and<br>
epidermal keratinocytes. Also these results indicate 'that the cells of the<br>
invention are promising candidates in therapeutic application of these cells<br>
areas such as regenerative medicine, aging medicine, tissue repair and tissue<br>
engineering.<br>
[0081] Mesenchymal cells were further characterized by analysis of<br>
secreted cytokines and growth factors in comparison with human bone-marrow<br>
mesenchymal stem cells. The umbilical cord epithelial stem cells (UCEC) were<br>
analysed in comparison with human epidermal keratinocytes. This analysis was<br>
carried out as follows: Briefly, UMMC, UCEC, dermal fibroblasts, bone-marrow<br>
mesenchymal cells, epidermal keratinocytes were cultured in growth media until<br>
100% confluence (37°C, 5% CO2) and then synchronized in starvation medium<br>
(serum-free DMEM) for 48 hours. The next day, the medium was replaced the<br>
next against fresh serum-free DMEM and the cells then were cultivated for<br>
another 48 hours. Conditioned media were collected, concentrated and<br>
analyzed using a Cytokine Array (RayBiotech, Inc. GA, USA).<br>
[0082]The results of this analysis show that UCMC secrete Interleukin-6<br>
(lL-6); (MCP1); hepatocyte growth factor (HGF); lnterieukin-8 (IL8); sTNFRI;<br>
GRO; TIMP1; TIMP2; TRAILR3; uPAR; ICAM1; IGFBP3; IGFBP6 (Fig.11),<br>
whereas UCEC secrete IGFBP-4; PARC; EGF; IGFBP-2; IL-6; Angiogenin;<br>
GCP-2; IL1Ra; MCP-1; RANTES; SCF; TNF# HGF; IL8; sTNFR; GRO; GRO-a;<br>
Amphiregulin; IL-1R4/ST2; T1MP1; TIMP2; uPAR; VEGF (Fig.12).<br>
[0083] Accordingly, this shows that both cells types secrete large<br>
amounts of cytokines and growth factors that play important roles in<br>
developmental biology, tissue homeostasis, tissue repair and regeneration and<br>
angiogenesis. This further demonstrates the versatility of the cells of the<br>
invention for use in the respective therapeutic applications.<br>
[0084] In addition, the cells of the invention were further examined with<br>
respect to their safety profile using mouse teratoma formation assay as an<br>
indicator. Six SCID mice were used in these experiments. A suspension of more<br>
than 2 million UCMG was injected with a sterile 25G needle into the thigh<br>
muscle of each SCID mouse. Animals were kept up to 6 months and tumor<br>
formation, was assessed. No tumor formation was observed in these mice (data<br>
not shown). This indicates that the cells of the invention are safe and do not<br>
have any capability to form tumors, benign or otherwise.<br>
Example 4: Cultivation of stem/progenitor cells in serum free media<br>
[0085] UCMC cells were cultured in DMEM containing 10 PCS and in<br>
serum-free media, PTT-1, PTT-2 and PTT-3. The three media PTT-1, PTT-2<br>
and PTT-3 were prepared by one of the present inventors, Dr Phan. in brief,<br>
these 3 media do not contain fetal bovine or human serum, but contain different<br>
cytokines and growth factors such as IGF, EGF, TGF-beta, Activin A, BMPs,<br>
PDGF, transferrin, and insulin. The growth factor components vary between<br>
media to assess differential growth characteristics. The cultivation was carried<br>
out as follows: Different proportions of growth factors and cytokines were added<br>
in basal media. UCMC were thawed and maintained in these media for 10 days.<br>
Ceil proliferation was monitored under light microscopy.<br>
[0086] Fig. 13 shows good UCMC growth in the 4 different media groups<br>
(Fig. 13-1 to Fig.13-5), wherein the morphology of UCMC cells is different<br>
depending on the ratio or proportion of cytokines or growth factors present in<br>
the respective media. In contrast, bone marrow and adipose-derived<br>
mesenchymal cells did not grow well in these serum-free media (Fig.13-6 and<br>
Fig.13-7). Accordingly, the good growth of the UCMC demonstrates the<br>
robustness of the cells of the invention and their high viability, indicating that<br>
their growth characteristics are superior to conventional sources of<br>
mesenchymal stem cells as bone marrow derived and adipose-derived<br>
mesenchymal cells. In this respect, it is worth to note that (bovine) serum free<br>
medium was used in these experiments and that the majority of human<br>
mesenchymal cells do not grow well in serum-free medium systems. Thus,<br>
using the cells of the invention in connection with defined serum-free media<br>
technologies is a big advantage in cell therapy as the risks of using fetal bovine<br>
serum for cell culture and expansion are removed. (Although use of bovine<br>
serum has been practiced for a long time and typically optimizes cell growth,<br>
concerns of its used have been raised as to the transmission of zoonoses as<br>
Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (Mad Cow Disease)).<br>
Example 5: Characterization of the gene expression profile of umbilical<br>
cord epithelial and mesenchymal stem cells<br>
[0087]The gene expression profile of umbilical cord epithelial and<br>
mesenchymal stem cells was analyzed using a DNA microarray. For this<br>
purpose, UCMC and UCEC were cultured in growth media at 37°C, 5% CO2<br>
until 100% confluence. Cells were synchronized in basal media for 48 hours<br>
then replaced with fresh basal media for another 48 hours. Total RNA was<br>
harvested and sent to Silicon Genetics Microarray Service. Data analysis was<br>
performed using GeneSpring 7.2). Fig. 14 summarizes the global gene<br>
expression. UCEC expressed a total of 28055 genes and UCMC expressed a<br>
total of 34407 genes. There are 27308 overlapping genes expressing in both<br>
cell types. 747 genes expressed were unique to UCEC and 7099 genes<br>
expressed were unique to UCMC. The selected genes of interest are presented<br>
in Fig. 14.<br>
[0088] Both stem cell types expressed 140 genes related to embryonic<br>
stem cells and embryonic development, further supporting that the cells of the<br>

Example 6: Direct differentiation of umbilical cord epithelial stem cells<br>
(UCEC) into skin epidermal keratinocytes<br>
[0092] For differentiation into skin epidermal keratinocytes, umbilical<br>
cord epithelial stem cells, UCEC cells, were cultured according to a standard<br>
protocol for the cultivation of keratinocytes. Cell isolation techniques were as<br>
described above. UCEC were then cultured in serum-free keratinocyte growth<br>
media, KGM, KGM-2 (Cambrex), EpiLife (Cascade Biologies) or in Green's<br>
medium in the presence of irradiated or Mytomycin-C treated 3T3 mouse<br>
embryonic feeder layer at 37°C, 5% COz). UCEC cell morphology thus<br>
differentiated resembled human epidermal keratinocytes. Epithelial cells have<br>
similar morphology under light microscope and can be easily turned into<br>
fibroblasts using conventional and commercially available media (cf., Figure 2).<br>
[0093]lmmunofluorescent analysis shows that the cultivated UCEC also<br>
express epidermal keratinocyte molecular markers such as keratins,<br>
desmosome, hemidesmosome and basement membrane components (see also<br>
Fig. 10 that shows that UCEC are qualified to be epithelial cells in general by<br>
expressing a variety of these epithelial cell markers). Accordingly, these results<br>
show that umbilical cord epithelial progenitor/stem cells of the present invention<br>
can be differentiated into skin cells such as epidermal keratinocytes which can<br>
be used for wound healing and have great potential for the development of<br>
cultured skin equivalents.<br>
Example 7: Expansion of umbilical cord epithelial and mesenchymal stem<br>
cells using repetitive tissue explants of umbilical cord lining membrane<br>
tissues<br>
[0094] Umbilical cord epithelial and mesenchymal stem cells of the<br>
invention were expanded using repetitive explants of umbilical cord amniotic<br>
membrane tissue as follows. Briefly, at day 1 of process, tissue explants were<br>
plated onto tissue culture dishes in growth media (DMEM/10%FCS, EpiLife,<br>
KGM, KGM-2 or M171) at 37°C, 5%CO2; media was changed every 2 or 3<br>
days. Cell outgrowths started and continued migrating from the explants for 7<br>
days. After that, tissue explants were transferred to other dishes to allow further<br>
cell outgrowth. This process was continued until the explants had diminished in<br>
size, preventing further explantation. In this connection it is noted that the<br>
explants progressively shrink in size until they are too small for further tissue<br>
explant since during the process of cells outgrowing and migrating from tissue<br>
explants, the cells produce proteases to digest and break down tissue. Fig. 16<br>
schematically illustrates the rapid and robust expansion process of umbilical<br>
cord epithelial and mesenchymal stem cells achieved using this protocol. Thus,<br>
this study demonstrates the high yield of UCMC and UMEC cells can be<br>
obtained from this source, further reflecting the high viability and pro-growth<br>
characteristics oft these cells in comparison with other sources of cells as bonemarrow<br>
or adipose-derived stem cells. In addition, being a solid tissue, the<br>
successful repetitive explant technique used herein demonstrates that the cells<br>
of the invention can be uniformly extracted from the entire tissue instead of only<br>
certain portions. This allows the maximum number of cells that can be derived<br>
at a low passage instead of passing the cells through many generations causing<br>
deterioration of cells.<br>
Example 8: Direct differentiation of umbilical cord mesenchymal cells<br>
(UCMC) into skin dermal fibroblasts<br>
[0095J For differentiation into skin dermal fibroblasts, umbilical cord<br>
mesenchymal stem cells, UCMC cells were cultured according to a standard<br>
protocol for the cultivation of fibroblasts. Cell isolation techniques were as<br>
described above in Example 6. UCMC were then cultured in DMEM or<br>
commercially available fibroblast growth media (FGM). UCMC cell morphology<br>
thus differentiated resembled human dermal fibroblasts. Mesenchymal cells<br>
have similar morphology under light microscope and can be easily turned into<br>
fibroblasts using conventional and commercially available media (cf., <br><br><br><br>
