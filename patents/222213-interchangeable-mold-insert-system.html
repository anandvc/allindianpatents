				<td>TITLE: INTERCHANGEABLE MOLD INSERT SYSTEM<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to the field of injection molds, and more particularly, to<br>
an apparatus for removing and inserting mold inserts from injection molds.<br>
A conventional injection mold includes a core plate and a mating cavity plate into<br>
which the core assembly fits. The cavity and core are movable relative to each other<br>
between open and closed positions to define the molding chamber between them in the<br>
closed position. Typically, one half of the mold is affixed to a stationary platen (often<br>
referred to as the A side of the mold) while the other half (often referred to as the B side) is<br>
affixed to a movable platen. Container lids are commonly produced from injection molding<br>
process. Often, interchangeable mold inserts are used in injection molds for container lids.<br>
An example of such an insert is a closure insert or an engraving insert for container lids.<br>
The purpose of closure inserts is to mold opening configurations such as crimp-on,<br>
threaded and push in styles into the lid, which thereby will allow various closure styles to be<br>
utilized with the lid. Engraving inserts allow a' custom engraving to be evident on the lid.<br>
Typically, such inserts are secured on the mold cavity assembly from the face of the mold<br>
cavity by means of a mounting screw (as shown in Figure 1 and Figure 2). White it is<br>
possible to mount the insert from the rear of the cavity or core, the time and effort<br>
necessary for rear mounting of the insert by means of a mounting screw makes it<br>
practically infeasible to do so. In order to mount the insert by means of a screw from the<br>
rear, the core or cavity plate must be removed from the plate each time. Because inserts,<br>
such as closure inserts, may be changed several times a day during mold processing of<br>
lids, it is more common to mount the insert from the front of the mold, to allow easy access<br>
and speed of changing. With a blank insert, as with a closure insert which forms an<br>
opening with a membrane, the central panel of the lid will evidence the boss used to secure<br>
the blank in place (as seen in Figure 3). Known means of securing inserts within injection<br>
mold apparatus from the rear do not allow for quick and relatively easy insertion thereof<br>
without the removal of the mold plates.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is an object of the present invention to overcome, inter alia, the shortcomings of<br>
the prior art described above by providing an improved interchangeable insert system for<br>
molds. This and other objects are addressed by the present invention.<br>
According to one aspect of the invention, there is provided a mold insert system for<br>
an injection mold apparatus comprising a mold cavity plate and a mold core plate each<br>
secured to moid bases, relatively movable between open and closed positions, each<br>
having opposing faces, said faces meeting to define a mold cavity between the two faces,<br>
said cavity defining the shape of a molded article, at least one of said faces defining a<br>
facial pocket therein for insertion of a mold insert, said facial pocket defining an insert<br>
passageway extending from the facial pocket through the plate and base, said mold insert<br>
secured to an insert rod, said insert rod insertable into said passageway to a prelock<br>
position, whereat said insert is partially inserted into said facial pocket; locking means<br>
operable from the periphery of the mold base connected to said insert rod to move said<br>
insert and rod from said prelock position to a fully inserted position whereat said insert is<br>
fully inserted within said pocket.<br>
Other advantages, features and characteristics of the present invention, as well as<br>
methods of operation and functions of the related elements of the structure, and the<br>
combination of parts and economies of manufacture, will become more apparent upon<br>
consideration of the following detailed description and the appended claims with reference<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE EXAMPLE EMBODIMENTS<br>
In the description below, like reference numerals are used to indicate components<br>
which are similar in the various embodiments of the present invention. As shown in the<br>
Figures 1 to 7C, a mold apparatus comprises mold plates 12,14 secured to mold bases 16,<br>
18 respectively. Core plate 12 is secured to core mold base 16. The cavity plate 14 is<br>
secured to cavity mold base 18, designed for mating with the core plate 12 such that when<br>
the plates are brought together, molten plastic may be injected between the plates, for<br>
producing molded plastic products. Such molten plastic is injected between the plate<br>
faces in a known manner, typically through a sprue 20 extending through the cavity plate to<br>
a nozzle (not shown) leading through the plate faces. Shown in Figures 1 and 2 is a mold<br>
insert system of the prior art, showing mold inserts 30 secured to mo!d plates 12,14, which<br>
in turn are secured upon mold bases 16,18. As shown in Figures 1 and 2, the cavity side<br>
 (side y) of the mold is shown with mold insert 30 secured to the mold plate by means of a<br>
screw 32 inserted from the front of the mold plate 14. As can been seen in Figure 2 and as<br>
explicitly shown in Figure 3, the mounting of the screw 32 from the front will show evidence<br>
of the screw boss on a molded article 34 when the insert is blank or when a membrane is<br>
present over the insert.<br>
Shown in Figures 4 to 7C is an embodiment of the invention which utilizes a cam<br>
system to clamp the insert 30 in place within a facial pocket 40 on the mold plate. As<br>
shown in Figure 4 (on the X side) a mold insert 30 is secured to an elongate insert rod 36<br>
having a transverse slot 38 extending thereacross. The insert 30 is secured to the insert<br>
rod 36 preferably by means of a socket head shoulder bolt screw fastener 37 or any other<br>
suitable means. As is illustrated in Figures 4, 5 and 78 and 7C, the mold insert 30 is<br>
positioned into a facial pocket 40 on the mold plate 12 shaped to accept the moid insert 30.<br>
The mold insert 30 includes a guide pin 51 on its rear face which is shaped to be inserted<br>
into a mating opening 53 in the pocket 40 which assists in proper radial positioning of the<br>
insert 30 within the pocket 40. Furthermore, radial locating slots 55 may be present on the<br>
insert and the mold face adjacent the pocket 40. The radial slots 55 on the mold face and<br>
insert are in alignment when the guide pins are properly inserted into their mating<br>
openings. The insert rod 36 may be inserted into an elongate insert passageway 46<br>
extending through the mold plate 12 and into the mold base 16, shaped to accept the insert<br>
rod 36. Figure 7A shows the facial pocket 40 shaped to accept the insert 30, which also<br>
shows the elongate insert passageway 46. Present within the facial pocket 40 is a spring<br>
loaded bumper 50 which acts against the insert 30 to bias the insert 30 in place within the<br>
insert pocket 40 slightly offset from being completely inserted in the pocket in the prelock<br>
(or offset) position as shown in Figure 4 (X-side) and Figure 7C. Also provided is a heavy<br>
tension spring 52 positioned adjacent the lead end 54 of the insert rod. The heavy tension<br>
spring 52 is attached between the body of the insert rod 36 and the head of the shoulder<br>
bolt screw 37. The body of the insert rod 36 is movable axially relative to screw 37. The<br>
spring 52 biases the screw head relative to the rod 36, however the spring 52 will allow<br>
some compression between the body of the rod 36 and the head of the screw 52. When<br>
the rod 36 is completely inserted into the passageway 46, the insert is in a prelock (or<br>
offset position) shown in Figure 4 (X-side) and 7C, namely with the insert being slightly<br>
offset from full insertion into the cavity, thereby allowing manual removal of the insert from<br>
the facial pocket. The spring 52 and bumper 50 biases the insert 30 in the prelock<br>
position.<br>
As shown in Figures 4 to 6, defined in mold base 16 is a transverse locking<br>
passageway 60, extending from a side wall 62 of the mold base, transversely to the length<br>
of the insert passageway 46, in communication with passageway 46 thereby allowing<br>
access to insert rod 30 when the rod 30 is inserted into passageway 46. Within the<br>
transverse passageway 60 is inserted a locking member or rod 64, rotatable about its axis<br>
(A-A), which extends therethrough and into the insert passageway 46. The locking<br>
member or rod 64 has an offset cam rod 66 extending axially from the end thereof. The<br>
offset cam rod 66 may be removable. When the insert rod 36 and insert 30 are in the<br>
prelock position, and the locking rod 64 Is inserted into the transverse passageway 60, the<br>
cam rod 66 engages the insert rod, sitting in transverse slot 38 in the insert rod 36. The<br>
locking member or rod 64 may be rotated about its axis A-A by means of a locking handle<br>
70 secured to the outer end of the locking rod 64, adjacent the side wall of the mold base<br>
62. The locking handle is secured to the locking rod by any suitable means and may<br>
include a handle grip 75 to assist in operation of the handle. The locking handle 70<br>
extends transversely to the locking rod 64 along the wall of the mold base 62. Rotating the<br>
locking handle 70 about the Axis A-A causes the locking rod 64 to rotate such that the<br>
offset cam rod 66 positioned within the slot 38, engaging the insert rod 36, moves the<br>
insert rod 36 axially (thereby compressing the spring 52 and bumper 50) from the prelock<br>
position of Figures 4 and 7C to the fully inserted position shown in Figure 5 (x side), 6 and<br>
7B. In particular, preferably rotating the locking handle 70 from a first position (as is seen<br>
in Figure 7C) where the insert is positioned in the prelock or offset position , to a second<br>
position (as is seen in Figure 7B), separated from the first position preferably by<br>
approximately 180 degrees, rotates the locking rod 64 and the cam rod 66, sufficiently such<br>
that rod 66 engages the wall 38A of the slot 38 and moves the insert rod 36 axially to<br>
cause the insert to move from the prelock position (of Figure 4 and 7C) to the fully inserted<br>
position of Figure 5,6 and 7B, where the insert is seated fully within the insert pocket with<br>
the insert face flush to the face of the mold plate. Rotating of the locking rod 64 from the<br>
second position to the first position causes the insert to be kicked from the fully inserted<br>
position of Figure 5,6 and 7B to the prelock position of Figure 4 and 7C and thereby allows<br>
the insert 30 to be manually removed from the pocket 40. The off set cam rod 66 could be<br>
rotated completely out of said insert passageway 46 if desired, for example when changing<br>
the insert 30 and insert rod 36. It should be understood that the locking rod may be rotated<br>
by any other suitable means, such as a rotatable knob secured to the end of the rod or any<br>
other type of handle operable from the periphery of the mold base. It should be further<br>
understood that the preferred positioning of the locking handle 70 is shown in Figures 7B<br>
and 7C only. To aid in the illustration of the parts of the locking handle, its proper<br>
positioning is not illustrated in Figures 4,5 and 6.<br>
The locking handle 70 may be releasably secured in place In each of the first and<br>
second positions by insertion of a locking pin 72 (or dowel or the like) therethrough which<br>
engages the mold base side wall 62 in an appropriate opening 73 therein. Although not<br>
shown, alternately, the locking handle may be inserted in place by means of a spring-ball<br>
type lock secured to the locking handle 70 which may sit in a recess in the mold base side<br>
wall 62 at the first and second positions. Further alternately, a spring biased grip locking<br>
handle (not shown) may be secured to the locking handle which would be biased to sit in<br>
recesses in the side wall 62 at the appropriate first and second positions. In order to move<br>
the locking handle in such an embodiment, the grip locking handle would have to be lifted<br>
out of the appropriate recesses.<br>
The heavy tension spring 52 on the insert rod permits the insert rod to be torqued<br>
against the back of the blank insert and allows the shaft to move in a direction along its<br>
axis with a pre set tension. The shaft moves under tension so that when the cam shaft is<br>
rotated into the fully inserted locked position, the blank insert will be pulled into a locked<br>
position with some cushioning. Having the spring compression provided by the spring 52<br>
allows for tolerance forgiveness. If the spring and/or the bumper are not utilized, and the<br>
components are out of position even minimally, the cam shown in C-C would either be<br>
loose which would make the blank insert loose or could put it under severe strain as it is<br>
being rotated into the fully inserted locked position.<br>
Although described above is the use of the invention with inserts used with container<br>
lids, it should be understood that the invention could be utilized to secure an insert to any<br>
form of injection mold face. The mold insert could be secured to the cavity side (such as<br>
side Y in Figure 4 and 5) of the mold in a like manner to that shown with respect to the core<br>
side in the above drawings Typically, the insert rod 36 used on the cavity side would be<br>
shorter in length than the insert rod used on the core side and the locking rod 64' would<br>
enter the cavity side plate 14 closer to its face as can be seen in Figures 4 and 5 (on the y<br>
side), illustrating an alternate embodiment of the invention (the rack and pinion<br>
embodiment as will be discussed below).<br>
Although the above description and drawings shows opening inserts, the insert<br>
system of the invention could be used with engraving inserts.<br>
Alternate insert systems which act on the insert rod 36 to bring the insert 30 into the<br>
facial pocket 40 may be utilized. For example, shown in Figure 4 and 5 (on the Y side), the<br>
cavity side, and in Figure 8, a rack and pinion mounting system is illustrated whereby<br>
locking handle 70 causes locking rod 64' to rotate about its axis and cause the gear<br>
members 74 to engage mating portions 76 of the insert rod 36' to move along its axis<br>
between the prelock or offset and fully inserted insert positions. The gear member must be<br>
disengaged from the insert rod to allow removal of the insert from the facial pocket. It<br>
should be understood that other means of rotation could be utilized such as knob<br>
positioned on the peripheral end of the locking rod to rotate the locking rod about its axis.<br>
Other alternate embodiments are shown in Figures 9 and 9A. On the y side of<br>
Figure 9, the locking handle 70 rotates, actuating a transversal movement of the locking<br>
rod 64' or 64". The transversal movement of locking rod 64' and 64" are the same as will<br>
be discussed below. It should be understood that such transversal movement-may be<br>
achieved in any known manner. A slanted profile 101 on the locking rod 64' engages<br>
mating slots 82 in the insert rod 36 moving it between the prelock and fully inserted<br>
positions as it advances and retracts axially. As can be seen on the x side of Figure 9,<br>
locking rod 64" consists of two parts 63A and 63B, threadably engaged together with part<br>
63A being rotatable by the handle 70 to threadably engaging a mating bore in the end of<br>
part 63B. Part 638 is prevented from rotation by means of a dowel 164 in notch 165. The<br>
dowel may be anchored in mold plate 14 (or alternately in plate 12 or base 16 or 18,<br>
depending on which side of the mold this embodiment is utilized with). Part 63A is<br>
prevented from moving axially when being rotated into threaded engagement with part 63B<br>
and thus 638 is caused to move forward or reverse along the direction T-T as 63A is<br>
threadably advanced into 63B. As part 63B advances along the direction of arrow T-T, an<br>
angled pin 84 engages insert rod 36" and as part 63B is advances along direction T-T, the<br>
angled pin 84 moving forward or reverse along direction T-T causes insert rod and insert to<br>
move between prelock and fully inserted positions. Again, it should be understood that the<br>
locking rod 64" may be rotated to cause such transversal movement by any suitable<br>
rotation means such as a rotatable knob or other suitable means.<br>
Finally, it is to be understood that while certain embodiments of the present<br>
invention have been herein shown and described, it will be understood that various<br>
changes in size and shape of parts may be made. It will be evident that these<br>
modifications, and others which may be obvious to persons of ordinary skill in the art, may<br>
be made without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention, which is accordingly<br>
limited only by the claims appended hereto, purposively construed.<br><br><br><br>
