				<td>HYDROCARBON GAS PROCESSING<br>
SPECIFICATION<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a process for the separation of a gas<br>
containing hydrocarbons.<br>
Ethylene, ethane, propylene, propane and/or heavier hydrocarbons can<br>
be recovered from a variety of gases, such as natural gas, refinery-gas, and synthetic<br>
gas streams obtained from other hydrocarbon materials such as coal, crude oil,<br>
naphtha, oil shale, tar sands, and lignite. Natural gas usually has a major proportion of<br>
methane and ethane, i.e., methane and ethane together comprise at least 50 mole<br>
percent of the gas. The gas also contains relatively lesser amounts of heavier<br>
hydrocarbons such as propane, butanes, pentanes and the like, as well as hydrogen,<br>
nitrogen, carbon dioxide and other gases.<br>
The present invention is generally concerned with the recovery of<br>
ethylene, ethane, propylene, propane and heavier hydrocarbons from such gas streams.<br>
A typical analysis of a gas stream to be processed in accordance with this invention<br>
would be, in approximate mole percent, 92.12% methane, 3.96% ethane and other C2<br>
components, 1.05% propane and other C3 components, 0.15% iso-butane, 0.21%<br>
normal butane, 0.11% pentanes plus, with the balance made up of nitrogen and carbon<br>
dioxide. Sulfur containing gases are also sometimes present.<br>
The historically cyclic fluctuations in the prices of both natural gas and<br>
its natural gas liquid (NGL) constituents have at times reduced the incremental value<br>
of ethane, ethylene, propane, propylene. and heavier components as liquid products.<br>
Competition for processing rights has forced plant operators to maximize the<br>
processing capacity and recovery efficiency of their existing gas processing plants.<br>
Available processes for separating these materials include those based upon cooling<br>
and refrigeration of gas, oil absorption, and refrigerated oil absorption. Additionally,<br>
cryogenic processes have become popular because of the availability of economical<br>
equipment that produces power while simultaneously expanding and extracting heat<br>
from the gas being processed. Depending upon the pressure of the gas source, the<br>
richness (ethane, ethylene, and heavier hydrocarbons content) of the gas, and the<br>
desired end products, each of these processes or a combination thereof may be<br>
employed.<br>
The cryogenic expansion process is now generally preferred for natural<br>
gas liquids recovery because it provides maximum simplicity with ease of start up,<br>
operating flexibility, good efficiency, safety, and good reliability. U.S. Pat. Nos.<br>

No. 33,408; and co-pending application no. 09/054,802 describe relevant processes<br>
(although the description of the present invention in some cases is based on different<br>
processing conditions than those described in the cited U.S. patents and patent<br>
applications).<br>
In a typical cryogenic expansion recovery process, a feed gas stream<br>
under pressure is cooled by heat exchange with other streams of the process and/or<br>
external sources of refrigeration such as a propane compression-refrigeration system.<br>
As the gas is cooled, liquids may be condensed and collected in one or more<br>
separators as high-pressure liquids containing some of the desired C2+ components.<br>
Depending on the richness of the gas and the amount of liquids formed, the<br>
high-pressure liquids may be expanded to a lower pressure and fractionated. The<br>
vaporization occurring during expansion of the liquids results in further cooling of the<br>
stream. Under some conditions, pre-cooling the high pressure liquids prior to the<br>
expansion may be desirable in order to further lower the temperature resulting from<br>
the expansion. The expanded stream, comprising a mixture of liquid and vapor, is<br>
fractionated in a distillation (demethanizer) column. In the column, the expansion<br>
cooled stream(s) is (are) distilled to separate residual methane, nitrogen, and other<br>
volatile gases as overhead vapor from the desired C2 components. C3 components, and<br>
heavier hydrocarbon components as bottom liquid product.<br>
If the feed gas is not totally condensed (typically it is not), at least a<br>
portion of the vapor remaining from the partial condensation can be passed through a<br>
work expansion machine or engine, or an expansion valve, to a lower pressure at<br>
which additional liquids are condensed as a result of further cooling of the stream.<br>
The pressure after expansion is essentially the same as the pressure at which the<br>
distillation column is operated. The combined vapor-liquid phases resulting from the<br>
expansion are supplied as a feed to the column. In recent years, the preferred<br>
processes for hydrocarbon separation involve feeding this expanded vapor-liquid<br>
stream at a mid-column feed point, with an upper absorber section providing<br>
additional rectification of the vapor phase.<br>
The source of the reflux stream for the upper rectification section is<br>
typically a portion of the above mentioned vapor remaining after partial condensation<br>
of the feed gas, but withdrawn prior to work expansion. An alternate source for the<br>
upper reflux stream may be provided by a recycled stream of residue gas supplied<br>
under pressure. Regardless of its source, this vapor stream is usually cooled to<br>
substantial condensation by heat exchange with other process streams, e.g., the cold<br>
fractionation tower overhead. Some or all of the high-pressure liquid resulting from<br>
partial condensation of the feed gas may be combined with this vapor stream prior to<br>
cooling. The resulting substantially condensed stream is then expanded through an<br>
appropriate expansion device, such as an expansion valve, to the pressure at which the<br>
demethanizer is operated. During expansion, a portion of the liquid will usually<br>
vaporize, resulting in cooling of the total stream. The flash expanded stream is then<br>
supplied as top feed to the demethanizer. Typically, the vapor portion of the expanded<br>
stream and the demethanizer overhead vapor combine in an upper separator section in<br>
the fractionation tower as residual methane product gas. Alternatively, the cooled and<br>
expanded stream may be supplied to a separator to provide vapor and liquid streams,<br>
so that thereafter the vapor is combined with the tower overhead and the liquid is<br>
supplied to the column as a top column feed.<br>
The purpose of this process is to perform a separation that produces a<br>
residue gas leaving the process which contains substantially all of the methane in the<br>
feed gas with essentially none of the C2 components and heavier hydrocarbon<br>
components, and a bottoms fraction leaving the demethanizer which contains<br>
substantially all of the C2 components and heavier hydrocarbon components with<br>
essentially no methane or more volatile components while meeting plant<br>
specifications for maximum permissible carbon dioxide content. The present<br>
invention provides a means for providing a new plant or modifying an existing<br>
processing plant to achieve this separation at significantly lower capital cost by<br>
reducing the size of or eliminating the need for a product treating system for removal<br>
of carbon dioxide. Alternatively, the present invention, whether applied in a new<br>
facility or as a modification to an existing processing plant, can be used to recover<br>
more C2 components and heavier hydrocarbon components in the bottom liquid<br>
product for a given carbon dioxide concentration in the feed gas than other processing<br>
schemes.<br>
In accordance with the present invention, it has been found that C2<br>
recoveries in excess of 84 percent can be maintained while maintaining the carbon<br>
dioxide content of the bottom liquid product within specifications and providing<br>
essentially complete rejection of methane to the residue gas stream. The present<br>
invention, although applicable at lower pressures and warmer temperatures, is<br>
particularly advantageous when processing feed gases at pressures in the range of 600<br>
to 1000 psia or higher under conditions requiring column overhead temperatures of<br>
-120°F or colder.<br>
The present invention uses a modified reboiler scheme which can be<br>
applied to any type of NGL recovery system. In a typical reboiler or side reboiler<br>
application in a distillation column, the entire column down-flowing liquid stream is<br>
withdrawn from the tower and passed through a heat exchanger, then returned to the<br>
column at essentially the same point in the column. In this modified reboiler system,<br>
a portion of the column down-flowing liquid is withdrawn from a point higher in the<br>
column, i.e., separated from the return point by at least one theoretical stage. Even<br>
though the flow rate of the liquid may be lower, it is usually much colder and can have<br>
advantages in improving recovery or reducing exchanger size.<br>
It has been found that when the present invention is applied to prior art<br>
processes for NGL recovery, the recovery of C2 components and heavier components<br>
is improved by one to two percent. The improvement in recovery is much greater,<br>
however, when it is desirable to reduce the carbon dioxide content in the recovered<br>
NGL product. Recovery of ethane in a typical NGL recovery plant also results in<br>
recovery of at least some of the carbon dioxide contained in the feed gas because<br>
carbon dioxide falls in between methane and ethane in relative volatility. Therefore,<br>
as ethane recovery increases, so does the recovery of carbon dioxide in the NGL<br>
product. By applying the modified reboiler scheme of the present invention, the<br>
applicants have found that it is possible to significantly improve recovery of ethane in<br>
the NGL product compared to use of the conventional reboiler or side reboiler systems<br>
when the column is reboiled to meet the desired carbon dioxide content in the NGL<br>
product.<br>

In the following explanation of the above figures, tables are provided<br>
summarizing flow rates calculated for representative process conditions. In the tables<br>
appearing herein, the values for flow rates (in pound moles per hour) have been<br>
rounded to the nearest whole number for convenience. The total stream rates shown<br>
in the tables include all non-hydrocarbon components and hence are generally larger<br>
than the sum of the stream flow rates for the hydrocarbon components. Temperatures<br>
indicated are approximate values rounded to the nearest degree. It should also be<br>
noted that the process design calculations performed for the purpose of comparing the<br>
processes depicted in the figures are based on the assumption of no heat leak from (or<br>
to) the surroundings to (or from) the process. The quality of commercially available<br>
insulating materials makes this a very reasonable assumption and one that is typically<br>
made by those skilled in the art.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE PRIOR ART<br>
FIG. 1 is a process flow diagram showing the design of a processing<br>
plant to recover C2+ components from natural gas using prior art according to U.S.<br>
Pat. No. 4,157,904. Because this is a large plant designed for 1.0 billion cubic feet of<br>
feed gas per day, the demethanizer (fractionation tower) is to be constructed in two<br>
sections, absorber column 17 and stripper column 19. In this simulation of the<br>
process, inlet gas enters the plant at 86°F and 613 psia as stream 31. If the inlet gas<br>
contains a concentration of sulfur compounds which would prevent the product<br>
streams from meeting specifications, the sulfur compounds are removed by<br>
appropriate pretreatment of the feed gas (not illustrated). In addition, the feed stream<br>
is usually dehydrated to prevent hydrate (ice) formation under cryogenic conditions.<br>
Solid desiccant has typically been used for this purpose.<br>
The feed stream 31 is cooled in exchanger 10 by heat exchange with<br>
cool residue gas at -99°F (stream 37a), demethanizer reboiler liquids at 31 °F (stream<br>
42), demethanizer lower side reboiler liquids at -5°F (stream 41) and demethanizer<br>
upper side reboiler liquids at -99°F (stream 40). Note that in all cases exchanger 10 is<br>
representative of either a multitude of individual heat exchangers or a single<br>
multi-pass heat exchanger, or any combination thereof. (The decision as to whether to<br>
use more than one heat exchanger for the indicated cooling services will depend on a<br>
number of factors including, but not limited to, inlet gas flow rate, heat exchanger<br>
size, stream temperatures, etc.) The cooled stream 31a enters separator 11 at -82°F<br>
and 603 psia where the vapor (stream 32) is separated from the condensed liquid<br>
(stream 35).<br>
The vapor (stream 32) from separator 11 is divided into two streams,<br>
33 and 34: Stream 33, containing about 18 percent of the total vapor, is combined<br>
with the condensed liquid from separator 11. The combined stream 36 passes through<br>
heat exchanger 12 in heat exchange relation with the demethanizer overhead vapor<br>
stream 37 resulting in cooling and substantial condensation of the stream. The<br>
substantially condensed stream 36a at -139°F is then flash expanded through an<br>
appropriate expansion device, such as expansion valve 13, to the operating pressure<br>
(approximately 333 psia) of absorber column 17 of the fractionation tower. During<br>
expansion a portion of the stream is vaporized, resulting in cooling of the total stream.<br>
In the process illustrated in FIG. 1. the expanded stream 36b leaving expansion valve<br>
13 reaches a temperature of-151°F and is supplied to separator section 17a in the<br>
upper region of absorber tower 17. The liquids separated therein become the top feed<br>
to theoretical stage 1 in rectifying section 17b. (An alternative routing for the<br>
separator liquid (stream 35) in accordance with U.S. Pat. No.4,278,457 is indicated by<br>
a dashed line whereby at least a portion of the liquid is expanded to approximately<br>
333 psia by expansion valve 16, cooling stream 35 to produce stream 35a that is then<br>
supplied to the rectifying section in absorber tower 17 at a bottom feed point or to<br>
stripper tower 19 at an upper feed point.)<br>
The remaining 82 percent of the vapor from separator 11 (stream 34)<br>
enters a work expansion machine 14 in which mechanical energy is extracted from<br>
this portion of the high pressure feed. The machine 14 expands the vapor<br>
substantially isentropically from a pressure of about 603 psia to a pressure of about<br>
333 psia, with the work expansion cooling the expanded stream 34a to a temperature<br>
of approximately -125°F. The typical commercially available expanders are capable<br>
of recovering on the order of 80-85% of the work theoretically available in an ideal<br>
isentropic expansion. The work recovered is often used to drive a centrifugal<br>
compressor (such as item 15). that can be used to re-compress the residue gas (stream<br>
37c), for example. The expanded and partially condensed stream 34a is supplied as<br>
feed to the distillation column at a lower feed point (below theoretical stage 7 in this<br>
case).<br>
The liquids (stream 38) from the bottom of absorber column 17 at<br>
-127°F are supplied by pump 18 to stripper column 19 at a top feed point (stream<br>
38a). The operating pressure of stripper column 19 (343 psia) is slightly higher than<br>
the operating pressure of absorber column 17 so that the pressure difference between<br>
the two towers provides the motive force for the overhead vapors (stream 39) at<br>
-125°F from the top of stripper column 19 to flow to the bottom feed point on<br>
absorber column 17.<br>
The demethanizer in absorber tower 17 and stripper tower 19 is a<br>
conventional distillation column containing a plurality of vertically spaced trays, one<br>
or more packed beds, or some combination of trays and packing. As is often the case<br>
in natural gas processing plants, the absorber tower may consist of two sections. The<br>
upper section 17a is a separator wherein the partially vaporized top feed is divided<br>
into its respective vapor and liquid portions, and wherein the vapor rising from the<br>
lower distillation or rectifying section 17b is combined with the vapor portion (if any)<br>
of the top feed to form the cold residue gas distillation stream 37 which exits the top<br>
of the tower. The lower, rectifying section 17b and the stripper column 19 contain the<br>
trays and/or packing and provide the necessary contact between the liquids falling<br>
downward and the vapors rising upward. The stripper column 19 also includes<br>
reboilers which heat and vaporize portions of the liquids flowing down the column to<br>
provide the stripping vapors which flow up the column.<br>
The liquid product (stream 43) exits the bottom of the tower at 43°F,<br>
based on a typical specification of a methane to ethane ratio of 0.0237:1 on a molar<br>
basis in the bottom product and is pumped to approximately 550 psia (stream 43a) in<br>
pump 20. (The discharge pressure of the pump is usually set by the ultimate<br>
destination of the liquid product. Generally the liquid product flows to storage and the<br>
pump discharge pressure is set so as to prevent any vaporization of stream 43a as it<br>
warms to ambient temperature.)<br>
The residue gas (stream 37) passes countercurrently to the incoming<br>
feed gas in: (a) heat exchanger 12 where it is heated to -99°F (stream 37a), (b) heat<br>
exchanger 10 where it is heated to 79°F (stream 37b), and (c) heat exchanger 21<br>
where it is heated to 110°F (stream 37c). The residue gas is then re-compressed in<br>
two stages. The first stage is compressor 15 driven by expansion machine 14, and the<br>
second stage is compressor 22 driven by a supplemental power source. After stream<br>
37e is cooled to 115°F (stream 37f) by cooler 23 and to 86°F by heat exchanger 21,<br>
the residue gas product (stream 37g) flows to the sales pipeline at 631 psia, sufficient<br>
to meet line requirements (usually on the order of the inlet pressure).<br>
A summary of stream flow rates and energy consumption for the<br>
process illustrated in FIG. 1 is set forth in the following table:<br>
As shown in Table I, the prior art illustrated in FIG. 1 achieves 84.89%<br>
ethane recovery using the available residue compression horsepower (45,000 HP<br>
maximum). However, the carbon dioxide concentration in the ethane product (the<br>
methane, ethane, and carbon dioxide stream that results when the bottoms liquid<br>
product is subsequently fractionated to separate the C2 components and lighter<br>
components from the C3 components and heavier hydrocarbon components) is 7.59<br>
mole percent, which exceeds the plant owner's specification of 6.0 mole percent<br>
maximum. Thus, this plant design would require the addition of a treating system to<br>
remove carbon dioxide from the hydrocarbons in order to produce a marketable liquid<br>
product. There are many options for removing the carbon dioxide (treating the<br>
incoming feed gas, treating the total liquid product, treating the ethane product after<br>
fractionation, etc.), but all of these options will add not only to the capital cost of the<br>
plant (due to the cost of installing the treating system) but also to the operating<br>
expense of the plant (due to energy and chemical consumption in the treating system).<br>
One way to keep the ethane product within the carbon dioxide<br>
specification is to operate the demethanizer in a manner to strip the carbon dioxide<br>
from the bottom liquid product, by adding more reboil heat to the column using the<br>
side reboilers and/or the bottom reboiler. FIG. 2 represents such an alternative<br>
operating scheme for the process depicted in FIG. 1. The process of FIG. 2 has been<br>
applied to the same feed gas composition and conditions as described above for FIG. 1.<br>
However, in the simulation of the process of FIG. 2 the process operating conditions<br>
have been adjusted to control the bottom temperature of stripper column 19 such that<br>
the carbon dioxide content of the ethane product is within specification.<br>
In the simulation of this process, as in the simulation for the process of<br>
FIG. 1, operating conditions were selected to keep the ethane recovery level as high as<br>
possible without exceeding the available residue gas compression horsepower. The<br>
feed stream 31 is cooled in exchanger tO by heat exchange with cool residue gas at<br>
-96°F (stream 37«), demethanizer reboiler liquids at 50°F (stream 42), demethanizer<br>
lower side reboiler liquids at 38°F (stream 41) and demethanizer upper side reboiler<br>
liquids at -32°F (stream 40). The cooled stream 31a enters separator 11 at -72°F and<br>
600 psia where the vapor (stream 32) is separated from the condensed liquid (stream<br>
35).<br>
The vapor (stream 32) from separator 11 is divided into two streams, 33<br>
and 34. Stream 33, containing about 17 percent of the total vapor, is combined with<br>
the condensed liquid from separator 11. The combined stream 36 passes through heat<br>
exchanger 12 in heat exchange relation with the demethanizer overhead vapor stream<br>
37 resulting in cooling and substantial condensation of the stream. The substantially<br>
condensed stream 36a at -132°F is then flash expanded through expansion valve 13.<br>
As the stream is expanded to the operating pressure of absorber column 17 (326 psia),<br>
it is cooled to a temperature of approximately -152°F (stream 36b). The expanded<br>
stream 36b is supplied to the tower as the top feed.<br>
The remaining 83 percent of the vapor from separator 11 (stream 34)<br>
enters work expansion machine 14 in which mechanical energy is extracted from this<br>
portion of the high pressure feed. The machine 14 expands the vapor substantially<br>
isentropically from a pressure of about 600 psia to the operating pressure of absorber<br>
tower 17 (326 psia), with the work expansion cooling the expanded stream 34a to a<br>
temperature of approximately -118°F. The expanded and partially condensed stream<br>
34a is supplied as a feed to the distillation column at a lower feed point.<br>
The liquids (stream 38) from the bottom of absorber column 17 at<br>
-120°F are supplied by pump 18 to stripper column 19 at a top feed point (stream 38a).<br>
The operating pressure of stripper column 19 (336 psia) is slightly higher than the<br>
operating pressure of absorber column 17 so that the pressure difference between the<br>
two towers provides the motive force for the overhead vapors (stream 39) at -118°F<br>
from the top of stripper column 19 to flow to the bottom feed point on absorber<br>
column 17.<br>
The liquid product (stream 43) exits the bottom of tower 19 at 56°F.<br>
This stream is pumped to approximately 5S0 psia (stream 43a) in pump 20. The<br>
residue gas (stream 37) passes countercurrently to the incoming feed gas in: (a) heat<br>
exchanger 12 where it is heated to -96°F (stream 37a), (b) heat exchanger 10 where it<br>
is heated to 70°F (stream 37b). and (c) heat exchanger 21 where it is heated to 101°F<br>
(stream 37c). The residue gas is then re-compressed in two stages, compressor 15<br>
driven by expansion machine 14 and compressor 22 driven by a supplemental power<br>
source. After stream 37c is cooled to 115°F (stream 37f) by cooler 23 and to 86°F by<br>
heat exchanger 21, the residue gas product (stream 37g) flows to the sales pipeline at<br>
631 psia.<br>
A summary of stream flow rates and energy consumption for the<br>
process illustrated in FIG. 2 is set forth in the following table:<br>
The carbon dioxide concentration in the ethane product for the FIG. 2<br>
process is 5.95 mole percent, complying with the plant owner's specification of 6.0<br>
mole percent maximum. Note, however, that the methane to ethane ratio in the<br>
bottom product is 0.0008:1 on a molar basis, versus the allowable ratio of 0.0237:1,<br>
indicating the degree of over-stripping required to control the carbon dioxide content<br>
of the liquid product at the required level. Comparison of the recover)' levels<br>
displayed in Tables I and II shows that operating the FIG. 2 process in this manner to<br>
reduce the carbon dioxide content in the ethane product causes a substantial reduction<br>
in liquids recovery. The FIG. 2 process reduces ethane recovery from 84.89% to<br>
68.94%, propane recovery from 96.90% to 96.61%, and butanes+ recovery from<br>
99.33% to 99.25%.<br>
There are two factors at work in the FIG. 2 process that result in less<br>
liquids recovery from the bottom of stripper tower 19 compared to the FIG. 1 process.<br>
First, when the temperature at the bottom of stripper column 19 is raised from 43°F in<br>
the FIG. 1 process to 56°F in the FIG. 2 process, the temperatures at each point in the<br>
column increase relative to their corresponding values in the FIG. 1 process. This<br>
reduces the amount of cooling that the tower liquid streams (streams 40,41, and 42)<br>
can supply to the feed gas in heat exchanger 10. As a result, the cooled feed stream<br>
(stream 31a) entering separator 11 is warmer (-72°F for the FIG. 2 process versus<br>
-82°F for the FIG. 1 process), which in turn results in the lower ethane retention in<br>
absorber column 17 reflected by the ethane content of stream 38 (3841 Lb. Moles/Hr<br>
for the FIG. 2 process versus 4734 Lb. Moles/Hr for the FIG. 1 process). Second, the<br>
higher temperatures in stripper column 19 cause the temperatures in absorber column<br>
17 to be higher, resulting in less methane liquid entering stripper column 19 (6842 Lb.<br>
Moles/Hr in stream 38 for the FIG. 2 process versus 11021 Lb. Moles/Hr for the<br>
FIG. 1 process). When this liquid methane is subsequently vaporized by the side<br>
reboilers and main reboiler attached to stripper column 19, the methane vapor helps to<br>
strip the carbon dioxide from the liquids flowing down the column. With less<br>
methane available in the FIG. 2 process to strip the carbon dioxide, more of the ethane<br>
in the liquids must be vaporized to serve as stripping gas. Since the relative<br>
volatilities for carbon dioxide and ethane are very similar, the ethane vapor is a much<br>
less effective stripping agent than the methane vapor, which reduces the stripping<br>
efficiency in the column.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Example 1<br>
FIG. 3 illustrates a flow diagram of a process in accordance with the<br>
present invention. The feed gas composition and conditions considered in the process<br>
presented in FIG. 3 are the same as those in FIG. 1. Accordingly, the FIG. 3 process<br>
can be compared with that of the FIG. 1 process to illustrate the advantages of the<br>
present invention.<br>
In the simulation of the FIG. 3 process, inlet gas enters at 86°F and a<br>
pressure of 613 psia as stream 31. The feed stream 31 is cooled in exchanger 10 by<br>
heat exchange with cool residue gas at -99°F (stream 37a), demethanizer reboiler<br>
liquids at 30°F (stream 42), demethanizer side reboiler liquids at -4°F (stream 41) and<br>
a portion of the liquids from the bottom of the absorber column at -128°F (stream 45).<br>
The cooled stream 31a enters separator 11 at -84°F and 603 psia where the vapor<br>
(stream 32) is separated from the condensed liquid (stream 35).<br>
The vapor (stream 32) from separator 11 is divided into gaseous first<br>
and second streams, 33 and 34. Stream 33, containing about 19 percent of the total<br>
vapor, is combined with the condensed liquid (stream 35) to form stream 36.<br>
Combined stream 36 passes through heat exchanger 12 in heat exchange relation with<br>
the cold residue gas (stream 37) where it is cooled to -138°F. The resulting<br>
substantially condensed stream 36a is then flash expanded through an appropriate<br>
expansion device, such as expansion valve 13, to the operating pressure<br>
(approximately 332 psia) of absorber tower 17. During expansion a portion of the<br>
stream is vaporized, resulting in cooling of the total stream. In the process illustrated<br>
in FIG. 3, the expanded stream 36b leaving expansion valve 13 reaches a temperature<br>
of -151°F and is supplied to absorber column 17 as the top column feed. The vapor<br>
portion (if any) of stream 36b combines with the vapors rising from the top<br>
fractionation stage of the column to form distillation stream 37, which is withdrawn<br>
from an upper region of the tower.<br>
Returning to the gaseous second stream 34, the remaining 81 percent<br>
of the vapor from separator 11 enters a work expansion machine 14 in which<br>
mechanical energy is extracted from this portion of the high pressure feed. The<br>
machine 14 expands the vapor substantially isentropically from a pressure of about<br>
603 psia to a pressure of about 332 psia, with the work expansion cooling the<br>
expanded stream 34a to a temperature of approximately -127°F. The expanded and<br>
partially condensed stream 34a is thereafter supplied as feed to absorber column 17 at<br>
a lower column feed point.<br>
Alternatively as shown by the dashed line, the condensed liquid<br>
(stream 35) from separator 11 could be flash expanded through an appropriate<br>
expansion device, such as expansion valve 16, to the operating pressure of absorber<br>
tower 17, cooling stream 35 to produce stream 35a. The expanded stream 35a<br>
leaving expansion valve 16 could then be supplied to absorber tower 17 at a lower<br>
column feed point or to stripper tower 19 at an upper column feed point.<br>
The liquids (stream 38) from the bottom of absorber column 17 enter<br>
pump 18 at -128°F and are pumped to higher pressure (stream 38a) and divided into<br>
two portions. One portion (stream 44), containing about 55% of the total liquid, is<br>
supplied to stripper column 19 at a top feed point. The operating pressure of stripper<br>
column 19 (342 psia) is slightly higher than the operating pressure of absorber column<br>
17 so that the pressure difference between the two towers provides the motive force<br>
for the overhead vapors (stream 39) at -123°F from the top of stripper column 19 to<br>
flow to the bottom feed point on absorber column 17.<br>
The other portion (stream 45), containing the remaining 45% of the<br>
pumped liquid stream 38a, is directed to heat exchanger 10 where it supplies part of<br>
the feed gas cooling as it is heated to -20°F and partially vaporized. The heated<br>
stream 45a is thereafter supplied to stripper column 19 at a mid-column feed point,<br>
separated from the top feed point where stream 44 enters the column by at least one<br>
theoretical stage. In this case, the partially vaporized stream flows to the same point<br>
on the column that was used for the upper side reboiler return (theoretical stage 8 in<br>
stripper tower 19) in the FIG. 1 process, which is the equivalent of seven theoretical<br>
stages lower than the liquid stream withdrawal point in the fractionation system (the<br>
top feed point where stream 44 enters stripper column 19).<br>
The liquid product (stream 43) exits the bottom of tower 19 at 42°F.<br>
This stream is pumped to approximately 550 psia (stream 43a) in pump 20. The<br>
residue gas (stream 37) passes countercurrently to the incoming feed gas in: (a) heat<br>
exchanger 12 where it is heated to -99°F (stream 37a), (b) heat exchanger 10 where it<br>
is heated to 80°F (stream 37b). and (c) heat exchanger 21 where it is heated to 105°F<br>
(stream 37c). The residue gas is then re-compressed in two stages, compressor 15<br>
driven by expansion machine 14 and compressor 22 driven by a supplemental power<br>
source. After stream 37e is cooled to 115°F (stream 371) by cooler 23 and to 86°F by<br>
heat exchanger 21, the residue gas product (stream 37g) flows to the sales pipeline at<br>
631 psia.<br>
A summary of stream flow rates and energy consumption for the<br>
process illustrated in FIG. 3 is set forth in the following table:<br>
A comparison of Tables 1 and III shows that, compared to the prior art,<br>
the present invention improves ethane recovery from 84.89% to 86.12%, propane<br>
recovery from 96.90% to 97.10%, and butanes+ recovery from 99.33% to 99.41%.<br>
Comparison of Tables I and III further shows that the improvement in yields was<br>
achieved using equivalent horsepower (utility) requirements.<br>
By using the modified reboiler approach, the column liquid flowing to<br>
heat exchanger 10 (stream 45) is colder than the corresponding stream 40 of the FIG.<br>
1 process. This increases the cooling available to the inlet gas, because not only can<br>
considerably more duty be obtained from the liquids with this scheme, but the liquids<br>
are available at a colder temperature level than would be possible with a conventional<br>
reboiler scheme. The result is increased C2+ component and heavier hydrocarbon<br>
component recoveries for the FIG. 3 process while using essentially the same amount<br>
of residue gas compression horsepower as the prior art FIG; 1 process.<br>
Example 2<br>
In those cases where the carbon dioxide content of the liquid product is<br>
an issue (due to more stringent product specifications imposed by the client as in the<br>
FIG. 2 prior art process described previously, for instance), the present invention<br>
offers very significant recovery and efficiency advantages over the prior art process<br>
depicted in FIG. 2. The operating conditions of the FIG. 3 process can be altered to<br>
reduce the carbon dioxide content in the liquid product of the present invention as<br>
illustrated in FIG. 4. The feed gas composition and conditions considered in the<br>
process presented in FIG. 4 are the same as those in FIGS. 1 and 2. Accordingly, the<br>
FIG. 4 process can be compared with that of the FIGS. 1 and 2 processes to illustrate<br>
the advantages of the present invention.<br>
In the simulation of the FIG. 4 process, the inlet gas cooling and<br>
separation scheme is essentially the same as that used in FIG. 3. The main difference<br>
is that the plant controls have been adjusted to increase the proportion of the liquids<br>
from the bottom of absorber tower 17 (stream 45) that are heated in heat exchanger 10<br>
and supplied to stripper tower 19 at a mid-column feed point. The plant controls have<br>
also been adjusted to raise the bottom temperature of stripper column 19 slightly<br>
(from 42°F in the FIG. 3 process to 45°F in the FIG. 4 process) to maintain the<br>
methane to ethane ratio in the bottom product at the specified 0.0237:1 molar ratio.<br>
The increased quantity of heated stream 45a entering stripper tower 19 and the higher<br>
bottoms temperature both increase the stripping inside the tower, which results in<br>
wanner temperatures for the FIG. 4 process relative to the FIG. 3 process throughout<br>
both absorber column 17 and smpper column 19, with the net effect of reducing the<br>
carbon dioxide content of the liquid product, stream 43, leaving stripper column 19.<br>
The warmer column temperatures also result in a slight reduction in the refrigeration<br>
that is available from the process streams to be applied to the column feed streams. In<br>
particular, this requires slightly reducing the proportion of the separator feed gas<br>
(stream 32) that is directed ;o heat exchanger 12 via stream. 33, thereby reducing the<br>
quantity of stream 36b entering at the top feed point of absorber tower 17.<br>
A summary of stream flow rates and energy consumption for the<br>
process illustrated in FIG. 4 is set forth in the following table:<br>
The carbon dioxide concentration in the ethane product for the FIG. 4<br>
process is 5.80 mole percent, well below the specification required by the client.<br>
Comparison of the recovery levels displayed in Tables I and IV shows that the present<br>
invention allows achieving the required carbon dioxide content while maintaining<br>
almost the same liquids recovery efficiency as the FIG. 1 process. Although the<br>
ethane recovery decreases slightly from 84.89% to 84.61%, the propane recovery and<br>
the butanes+ recovery both increase slightly, from 96.90% to 96.96% and from<br>
99.33% to 99.39%, respectively. Comparison of Tables I and IV further shows that<br>
maintaining the product yields was achieved using essentially the same horsepower<br>
(utility) requirements.<br>
Comparison of the recovery levels displayed in Tables II and IV shows<br>
that the present invention allows achieving much higher liquids recovery efficiency<br>
than the FIG. 2 process when it is operated in a fashion to limit the carbon dioxide<br>
content of its liquid product. Compared to the FIG. 2 process, the FIG. 4 process<br>
raises the ethane recovery from 68.94% to 84.61%, almost 15.7 percentage points<br>
higher. The propane recovery and the butanes+ recovery also increase somewhat,<br>
from 96.61% to 96.96% and from 99.25% to 99.39%, respectively. Comparison of<br>
Tables II and IV further shows that the higher the product yields were not simply the<br>
result of increasing the horsepower (utility) requirements. To the contrary, when the<br>
present invention is employed as in Example 2, not only do the ethane, propane, and<br>
butanes+ recoveries increase over those of the prior art process, but liquid recovery<br>
efficiency also increases by 23 percent (in terms of ethane recovered per unit of<br>
horsepower expended).<br>
As with the process of FIG. 3, a significant benefit achieved by the<br>
embodiment of FIG. 4 is that the modified reboiler scheme provides colder column<br>
liquids for use in refrigerating the incoming feed streams. This increases the cooling<br>
available to the inlet gas, as not only can considerably more duty be obtained from the<br>
liquid in this case, but at a colder temperature level. At the same time, more methane<br>
is introduced lower in stripper column 19 than would otherwise be there when<br>
reboiling the column to meet the carbon dioxide content. (Note that stream 45 in the<br>
FIG. 4 process contains 5721 Lb. Moles/Hr of methane and is introduced at<br>
theoretical stage 8 of stripper column 19. whereas stream 40 in the FIG. 2 process<br>
contains only 1886 Lb. Molcs/Hr of methane and is introduced at the top of stripper<br>
column 19). The additional methane provided by the present invention in the FIG. 4<br>
process helps to strip the carbon dioxide from the liquids flowing downward in the<br>
stripping column. The quantity of carbon dioxide in the NGL product can be adjusted<br>
by appropriate control of the quantity of liquid withdrawn to feed the modified<br>
reboiler system instead of feeding the top of the stripping column.<br>
Other Embodiments<br>
FIG. 5 is a flow diagram illustrating how the process and apparatus<br>
described and depicted in U.S. Pat. No. 5,568,737 can be adapted to be a natural gas<br>
processing plant in accordance with the present invention. FIGS. 6, 7, 8, and 9 are<br>
diagrams showing some of the alternative methods for implementing the modified<br>
reboiler scheme. FIG. 6 shows a typical thermosiphon type application wherein the<br>
partial flow of liquid from fractionation tower 50 to reboiler 57 could be controlled<br>
via valve 58 in liquid draw line 61. The liquid portion not withdrawn from the<br>
column simply overflows chimney tray 51 onto distributor 52 for packing (or trays)<br>
53 below. The heated stream in line 61a from reboiler 57 is returned to fractionation<br>
tower 50 at a lower point which contains an appropriate feed distribution mechanism,<br>
such as chimney tray 54 and distributor 55, to mix the heated stream with the<br>
down-flowing tower liquids from packing 53 and supply the mixture to packing (or<br>
trays) 56. FIGS. 7 and 8 show typical pumped adaptations wherein the total liquid<br>
down-flow is withdrawn in liquid draw line 61 and pumped to higher pressure by<br>
pump 60. The flow of the pumped liquid in line 61a is then divided via appropriate<br>
control valves 58 and 59 to arrive at the desired quantity of liquid in line 62 flowing<br>
to reboiler 57. The heated stream in line 62a from reboiler 57 is returned to<br>
fractionation tower 50 at a lower point as described previously for the FIG. 6<br>
embodiment. In the FIG. 7 embodiment, the liquid that does not flow to the reboiler<br>
(in line 63) is returned to chimney tray 51 from which the liquid was initially<br>
withdrawn, whereupon it can overflow chimney tray 51 onto distributor 52 for<br>
packing (or trays) 53 below. In the FIG. 8 embodiment, the liquid that does not flow<br>
to the reboiler (in line 63) is returned below chimney tray 51 from which the liquid<br>
was initially withdrawn, directly to distributor 52 that supplies the liquid to packing<br>
(or trays) 53 below. FIG. 9 shows how the pumped system described for FIG. 8 can<br>
be implemented in a split column approach, such as upper column 65 and lower<br>
column 50, which is the same as that used in FIGS. 3 and 4.<br>
One skilled in the art will recognize that the present invention gams<br>
some of its benefit by providing a colder stream to the side reboiler(s) and/or<br>
reboiler(s), allowing additional cooling of the column feed or feeds. This additional<br>
cooling reduces utility requirements for a given product recovery level, or improves<br>
product recovery levels for a given utility consumption, or some combination thereof.<br>
Further, one skilled in the art will recognize that the present invention also benefits by<br>
introducing greater quantities of methane lower in the demethanizer to assist in<br>
stripping carbon dioxide from the down-flowing liquids. With more methane<br>
available for stripping the liquids, correspondingly less ethane is needed for stripping,<br>
allowing more retention of ethane in the bottom liquid product. Therefore, the<br>
present invention is generally applicable to any process, dependent on cooling any<br>
number of feed streams and supplying the resulting feed stream(s) to the column for<br>
distillation.<br>
In accordance with this invention, the cooling of the demethanizer feed<br>
streams may be accomplished in many ways. In the process of FIGS. 3 and 4, feed<br>
stream 36 is cooled and substantially condensed by the demethanizer overhead vapor<br>
stream 37, while the demethanizer liquids (streams 45,41, and 42) are used only for<br>
gas stream cooling. In the process of FIG. 5, high pressure residue feed stream 48 is<br>
also cooled and substantially condensed by portions of the distillation column<br>
overhead vapor stream (streams 46 and 37), while the demethanizer liquids (streams<br>
40 and 42) are used only for gas stream cooling. However, demethanizer liquids<br>
could be used to supply some or all of the cooling and substantial condensation of<br>
stream 36 in FIGS. 3 through 5 and/or stream 48 in FIG. 5 in addition to or instead of<br>
gas stream cooling. Further, any stream at a temperature colder than the feed stream<br>
being cooled may be utilized. For instance, a side draw of vapor from the<br>
demethanizer could be withdrawn and used for cooling. Other potential sources of<br>
cooling include, but are not limited to, flashed high pressure separator liquids and<br>
mechanical refrigeration systems. The selection of a source of cooling will depend on<br>
a number of factors including, but not limited to, inlet gas composition and<br>
conditions, plant size, heat exchanger size, potential cooling source temperature, etc.<br>
One skilled in the art will also recognize that any combination of the above cooling<br>
sources or methods of cooling may be employed in combination to achieve the<br>
desired feed stream temperature(s).<br>
In accordance with this invention, the use of external refrigeration to<br>
supplement the cooling available to the inlet gas from other process streams may be<br>
employed, particularly in the case of an inlet gas richer than that used in Examples 1<br>
and 2. The use and distribution of demethanizer liquids for process heat exchange,<br>
and the particular arrangement of heat exchangers for inlet gas cooling must be<br>
evaluated for each particular application, as well as the choice of process streams for<br>
specific heat exchange services.<br>
The high pressure liquid in FIGS. 3 through 5 (stream 35) need not all<br>
be combined with the portion of the separator vapor (stream 33) flowing to heat<br>
exchanger 12. Alternatively, this liquid stream (or a portion thereof) may be<br>
expanded through an appropriate expansion device, such as expansion valve 16, and<br>
fed to a lower mid-column feed point on the distillation column (absorber tower 17 or<br>
stripper tower 19 in FIGS. 3 and 4. fractionation tower 17 in FIG. 5). The liquid<br>
stream may also be used for inlet gas cooling or other heat exchange service before or<br>
after the expansion step prior to flowing to the demethanizer.<br>
It will also be recognized that the relative amount of feed found in each<br>
branch of the column feed streams will depend on several factors, including gas<br>
pressure, feed gas composition, the amount of heat which can economically be<br>
extracted from the feed and the quantity of horsepower available. More feed to the<br>
top of the column may increase recovery while decreasing power recovered from the<br>
expansion machine thereby increasing the recompression horsepower requirements.<br>
Increasing feed lower in the column reduces the horsepower consumption but may<br>
also reduce product recover)'. The mid-column feed positions depicted in FIGS. 3<br>
and 4 are the preferred feed locations for the process operating conditions described.<br>
However, the relative locations of the mid-column feeds may vary depending on inlet<br>
composition or other factors such as desired recovery levels and amount of liquid<br>
formed during inlet gas cooling. Moreover, two or more of the feed streams, or<br>
portions thereof, may be combined depending on the relative temperatures and<br>
quantities of individual streams, and the combined stream then fed to a mid-column<br>
feed position. FIGS. 3 and 4 are the preferred embodiment for the compositions and<br>
pressure conditions shown. Although individual stream expansion is depicted in<br>
particular expansion devices, alternative expansion means may be employed where<br>
appropriate. For example, conditions may warrant work expansion of the<br>
substantially condensed portion of the feed stream (36a in FIGS. 3 through S) or the<br>
substantially condensed recycle stream (48b in FIG. 5).<br>
FIGS. 3 and 4 depict a fractionation tower constructed in two sections<br>
(17 and 19) because of the size of the plant. The decision whether to construct the<br>
fractionation tower as a single vessel (such as 17 in FIG. S) or multiple vessels will<br>
depend on a number of factors such as plant size, the distance to fabrication facilities,<br>
etc.<br>
While there have been described what are believed to be preferred<br>
embodiments of the invention, those skilled in the art will recognize that other and<br>
further modifications may be made thereto, e.g. to adapt the invention to various<br>
conditions, types of feed, or other requirements, without departing from the spirit of<br>
the present invention as defined by the following claims.<br>
