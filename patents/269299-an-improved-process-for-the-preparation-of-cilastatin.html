FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to an improved process for the preparation of Cilastatin of formula (I) or its sodium salt. The present invention also provides a direct isolation technique for Cilastatin acid from the reaction mixture.<br><br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE PRIOR ART<br>
Cilastatin sodium is the sodium salt of a derivatized heptenoic acid. Its chemical name is [R-[R*,S*-(Z)]]-7-[(2-amino-2-carboxyethyl)thio]-2-[[(2,2-dimethylcyclopropyl)carbonyl]amino]-2-heptenoic acid, monosodium salt. It is an off-white to yellowish-white, hygroscopic, amorphous compound. PRIMAXIN I.M. (Imipenem and Cilastatin for Injectable Suspension) is a formulation of Imipenem (a thienamycin antibiotic) and Cilastatin sodium.<br>
Imipenem with Cilastatin acts as an effective antibiotic for the treatment of infections of various body systems. PRIMAXIN I.M. is a potent broad-spectrum antibacterial agent for intramuscular administration. Imipenem can be further described as a semi-synthetic thienamycin that is administered intravenously or intramuscularly in combination with Cilastatin to reduce toxicity. Cilastatin, a renal dipeptidase inhibitor, inhibits the enzymatic breakdown of Imipenem and increases urinary excretion of the active drug.<br>
Originally Cilastatin was disclosed in US patent number 5,147,868. This patent   also   discloses   various   processes   for  the   preparation   of Cilastatin,<br><br>
particularly example 19 A of this patent disclose a process for the preparation of Cilastatin. According to this example the condensation of 7-chloro-2-oxoheptanoic acid ethyl ester (I) with (S)-2,2-dimethylcyclopropanecarboxamide (II) by means of p-toluene sulphonic acid in refluxing toluene gives (S)-7-chloro-2-(2,2-dimethylcyclopropanecarboxamido)-2-heptenoic acid ethyl ester (III), which is hydrolyzed in aq. NaOH to yield the corresponding carboxylic acid (IV). Finally, this compound is condensed with (R)-cysteine (V) by means of NaOH in water to afford the target Cilastatin, followed by isomerisation to at 3.0 pH. The process followed in this example is depicted as below:<br><br>
WO 03/018544 claims a process for the purification of Cilastatin, which comprises contacting a solution of crude Cilastatin with a non-ionic adsorbent resin and recovering pure Cilastatin from a solution thereof This publication also claims a process for the isomerisation of Cilastatin by heating a solution of Cilastatin containing the corresponding E isomer at a pH of about 0.5 to 1.5. This invention not suitable for plant point of view as it involves column chromatography.<br><br>
US 2004/0152780 claims a process for the preparation of pure Cilastatin sodium in an amorphous form which comprises recovering Cilastatin sodium from a solution thereof which contains an organic solvent, homogeneous mixture of organic solvents, or homogeneous mixture of organic solvents and water, by solvent precipitation. According to this patent the pure Cilastatin sodium in amorphous form was recovered from the solution of Cilastatin sodium in a solvent (where Cilastatin sodium was soluble) by adding an anti-solvent (where Cilastatin sodium was insoluble).<br>
WO 2006/022511 claims a process for preparing Cilastatin sodium via Cilastatin amine salt, also the said patent claims Cilastatin ammonium salt. However EP 0 048 301 page 2; line 33-37 &amp; US 4,616,038 col 36; 40-44 anticipates the claim of the said publication. Also this patent utilizes the column chromatography for removing sodium chloride.<br>
However taking the consideration the commercial importance of Cilastatin sodium and Imipenem, there remains a need of convenient process. Hence, we focused our research to find an alternative processes and succeeded with a process that eliminates the foregoing problems associated with earlier processes.<br>
OBJECTIVE OF THE INVENTION<br>
The primary objective of the present invention is to provide a commercial process for the preparation of Cilastatin.<br>
Another objective of the present invention is to provide a process for the preparation Cilastatin sodium with high purity and in good yields.<br><br>

during the synthesis, or unreacted intermediates is stirred at a pH in the range of 4.0 to 2.0 for a long period, the solid crystallized was filtered and if required subjected to purification. The solution of crude Cilastatin can be directly taken from the reaction mass or may be obtained by dissolving crude Cilastatin in water and water miscible solvent. It has been noted that the conventional methods requires column chromatography to remove the inorganic salt like sodium chloride that are formed during the course of reaction, whereas the present invention provides a process in which Cilastatin is directly crystallized from the reaction mass at the pH in the range of 2.0 to 4.0 more particularly at the pH in the range of 3.0.<br>

Accordingly the present invention provides a process for purification of Cilastatin.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention, there is provided a process for the isolation of pure Cilastatin from the solution of crude Cilastatin in water, which comprises treating the crude Cilastatin with amine like diphenyl ethylene diamine or dicyclohexylamine ethylene diamine (DDA) to yield amine<br><br>

In still another embodiment of the present invention, the Cilastatin obtained according to the present invention can be optionally subjected to isomerisation process by the technique known in prior art.<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention, the starting material 7-chloro-2-[[(lS)-232-dimethylcyclopropane]carboxamide]-2-heptenoic acid of formula (II) is prepared by utilizing the process available in the prior art.<br>
In one more embodiment of the present invention, the present invention provides a process for isomerisation of E-isomer of 7-chloro-2-[[(lS)-2,2-dimethy-clcyclopropane]carboxamide]-2-heptenoic acid, Cilastatin precursor which comprises treating the mixture of E and Z-7-chloro-2-[[(lS)-2,2-dimethy-lcyclopropane]carboxamide]-2-heptenoic acid in a solvent selected from toluene, MDC, water and the like or mixtures thereof with HC1 at a pH in the range of 0.5 to 4.5. The said isomerisation can be done at a temperature in the range of 10° C to reflux temperature of the solvent, preferably room temperature i.e. 27 to 35° C.<br>
In yet another embodiment of this present invention, the solvent used for the dissolution of Cilastatin acid is selected from ethanol, isopropanol, n-butanol, denatured sprit, acetone, THF, acetonitrile, DMF and the like or mixtures thereof. Thus present invention provides a novel process for the preparation of Cilastatin sodium. The solvent system is chosen such a way that the Cilastatin Sodium per se is insoluble in the solvent system<br><br>
In yet another embodiment of this present invention, the base used in step (a) is selected from DBU, DBN, DABCO, TMG, triethyl amine (TEA), DEA, diisoproyl amine, NaOH and the like.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE PRIOR ART<br>
Cilastatin sodium is the sodium salt of a derivatized heptenoic acid. Its chemical name is [R-[R*,S*-(Z)]]-7-[(2-amino-2-carboxyethyl)thio]-2-[[(2,2-dimethylcyclopropyl)carbonyl]amino]-2-heptenoic acid, monosodium salt. It is an off-white to yellowish-white, hygroscopic, amorphous compound. PRIMAXIN I.M. (Imipenem and Cilastatin for Injectable Suspension) is a formulation of Imipenem (a thienamycin antibiotic) and Cilastatin sodium.<br>
Imipenem with Cilastatin acts as an effective antibiotic for the treatment of infections of various body systems. PRIMAXIN I.M. is a potent broad-spectrum antibacterial agent for intramuscular administration.
