				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention pertains to communication<br>
systems and more particularly to communication<br>
systems supporting group calls which utilize internet<br>
protocol (IP).<br>
Group calls are similar to conference calls in<br>
which a number of subscribers are interconnected fdr<br>
the purpose of common conversation. Modern<br>
technology supports both wireless and wireline users<br>
in these group calls.<br>
Typically group calls are manually initiated by<br>
an originating user calling and establishing<br>
connection with a first participating user, then<br>
another participating user, etc. The originating<br>
user must control the selection and implement the<br>
connection to each of the participating users. This<br>
is very often time consuming and a slow lengthy<br>
process. Further, the originating user must have the<br>
capability of initiating conference calls via the<br>
originating user's local network.<br>
In more recent times, service providers offer a<br>
bridging arrangement for connecting multiple<br>
participants in a conference call. Typically these<br>
participants call in to a common number and enter a<br>
password for security purposes and then are<br>
interconnected through the bridging service provided<br>
by the service provider. Again, this is slow and it<br>
is up to each individual participant to call in to a<br>
common conference.<br>
Modern wireless technology provides for<br>
supporting group call functions. These arrangements<br><br>
typically involve dispatch services or push-to-talk<br>
(PTT) services. These group call interconnections<br>
may be made to wireline participants via the<br>
internet, for example. Typically the groups for the<br>
group call arrangements presently known are<br>
statically defined. That is a user, or administrator<br>
working on behalf of the user, must indicate to the<br>
switching network a list of participants for a group<br>
call in the background mode, or well in advance of<br>
the group call. This could be provisioned in the<br>
network by the user or an agent, and then provided<br>
some form of group identity to make the call. Then<br>
at another time an originating user may perform some<br>
signaling to initiate that he wishes to establish a<br>
group call with each of the pre-designated<br>
participants.<br>
As the needs of the originating participant<br>
change, this predefined group membership often leads<br>
to an inappropriate group for a particular set of<br>
circumstances. Often groups are larger than they<br>
need to be, since it is unknown when a group is<br>
established who will be needed for given future<br>
communication. Also, this presents a problem of<br>
privacy, since participants may be hearing a<br>
conversation that the originating user does not want<br>
them to hear. Further, this statically defined<br>
/provisioned group call wastes network time and<br>
resources and is relatively inflexible.<br>
Accordingly, what is needed is a method for<br>
maximizing communication efficiency for group calls<br>
in a communication system.<br><br><br>

PREFERRED EMBODIMENT OF THE INVENTION<br>
Referring to FIG. 1, a block diagram of a<br>
communication system 100 including a dispatch service<br>
complex 50 and a number of user/participants 10-40.<br>
Users 10-30 happen to be wireless users with user 10<br>
being the group call originator. These wireless<br>
users 10-30 are interfaced through a wireless network<br>
25 to an internet or enterprise intranet 45.<br>
Internet 45 also provides an interface for user<br>
40. Each of the users 10-40 is coupled through<br><br>
internet 45 to an appropriate interface within the<br>
dispatch service complex 50. Each of the users 10-40<br>
is coupled from internet 45 to call server 55.<br>
Database 60 provides for storage and retrieval of<br>
group call information under the direction of call<br>
server 55. Database 60 will then provide the<br>
identity of wireless users to wireless user interface<br>
70. Internal wireless user interface 70 will provide<br>
these to the internet 45 which will disburse them to<br>
wireless data network 25 for subsequent connection<br>
with users 10-30. Similarly, database 60 will<br>
indicate the identity of wireline users to wireline<br>
user interface 65. Wireline user interface 65 will<br>
connect to internet 45 to wireline user 40.<br>
The kind of group call supported in this<br>
disclosure is a dynamic group call (DGC). The DGC<br>
presented herein is a selectable service by a user or<br>
originator 10. At the present time such selectable<br>
dynamic group call service is also referred to as a<br>
dynamic ad hoc group call or group call service.<br>
The dynamic group call service disclosed herein<br>
is selected and controlled by an end user designated<br>
as an originator 10. No service operator<br>
intervention is necessary to create designated groups<br>
for this dynamic group call service.<br>
The dynamic group call service is network<br>
independent and could operate within, GSM, CDMA.,<br>
iDEN, UMTS, wireless LAN and virtually any data<br>
network.<br>
Generally, originating user 10 selects other<br>
user participants 20-40 for a group call from either<br>
their address book or by specifying their<br>
identity/address. "Nesting" of groups is permitted<br>
by this system. That is, when originator 10 selects<br><br>
the member participants of a group, one of the member<br>
participants may itself be a group or subgroup.<br>
Typically, originating user 10 will send the identity<br>
of the members of an ad-hoc dynamic group to the<br>
network before beginning the group call in order to<br>
minimize call setup time.<br>
Once the group membership has been defined, the<br>
dispatch service complex 50 will create a group ID<br>
and transmit the group ID (identification) back to<br>
the originating user 10. These group Ids are<br>
dynamically assigned by the dispatch service complex<br>
50. Alternatively, the dynamic group may also be<br>
created by the originating user 10 and immediately<br>
activated (called) for the group call service.<br>
When the group has been created and its<br>
activation requested by originator 10, each of the<br>
target participant users 20-40 are activated and<br>
called as in a typical group call. Each of the<br>
target users is informed that this is a group call<br>
and given the group ID by the dispatch service<br>
complex 50, and the identity of the group call<br>
originator. The target handset at each target user<br>
20-40 may store the group ID provided. With this<br>
group ID being stored by each participant 10-40, any<br>
participant may make use of the "call back service" .<br>
That is, user participant 40 may reinitiate the group<br>
call after it has ended or may leave and rejoin an<br>
ongoing group call at will by using this group ID.<br>
The group ID stored by each of the participants<br>
will remain valid until reallocated or invalidated by<br>
the dispatch service complex 50. Optionally, each<br>
defined group and group ID may have associated with<br>
it a feature termed "time to live" (TTL) . This<br><br>
indicates a time when reached which the group ID will<br>
expire and no longer be valid.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, group call originator<br>
10 is allocated a number of potential or possible<br>
groups from a fixed pool of groups for all users.<br>
For example, originator 10 may have 10 entries within<br>
the database 60 for storage of group information.<br>
When all ten entries in database 60 have been used,<br>
another group creation by originator 10 may result in<br>
the oldest entry being overridden with the new group<br>
information. Other overriding schemes are also<br>
possible. Among them are first in/first out, first<br>
in/last out and least used group.<br>
Referring to FIG. 2, a layout of a data<br>
structure 8 0 supporting the dynamic group call method<br>
is shown. From left to right the various fields will<br>
be discussed and explained. First, the entry field<br>
81 indicates the number of groups actively allotted<br>
to a particular user. Group entry 82 which is<br>
indicated as N is the highest number of groups<br>
allowed to be stored for this particular user.<br>
The next field 84 is a list of the members for<br>
each particular group. The next field 86 is the<br>
unique group ID assigned by the dispatch service<br>
complex 50 followed by the originating user's URL at<br>
server Ncarrier.com for example. This indicates the<br>
particular internet server for handling the group<br>
establishment for each of the participants to the<br>
group call.<br>
Optionally, the next field 88 is a time to live<br>
(TTL) field. This field may indicate the life span<br>
or time to live for each dynamic group 81. The TTL<br>
field 88 may include a predefined time after which<br>
the group ID is no longer valid will be reallocated<br><br>
by the dispatch service complex 50. In another<br>
approach, as mentioned above, a fixed time limit may<br>
be set for each of the user groups after which the<br>
group ID will become invalid and expire. These time<br>
limits may be a day, a month, a year, etc.<br>
FIG. 3 depicts a flow chart of the creation of a<br>
dynamic group call by the originating user 10. These<br>
group calls provide for a high degree of<br>
selectability of group members and timing or<br>
longevity of a given group.<br>
The user selects the dynamic group call<br>
definition option from the menu of the originating<br>
wireless user device 10 and block 90 is entered.<br>
Block 90 transfers control to block 92. Block 92<br>
determines from user input whether the request is to<br>
add a member to the group, add a group, create a<br>
dynamic group call or activate a previously created<br>
dynamic group call in response to the push-to-talk<br>
feature of the wireless handset. If the request<br>
indicated by the user input was to add a member to<br>
the group, block 92 transfers control to block 94 via<br>
the add member path. Block 94 first determines if<br>
the request is within the limit of members for group<br>
call. If it is not, block 94 transfers control to<br>
block 98 via the no path. Block 98 provides feedback<br>
to the user to indicate that the request cannot be<br>
accommodated and then the process is ended.<br>
If the member is within the number of members<br>
for a group call 94 transfers control to block 96 via<br>
the yes path. In block 96 the member is added to the<br>
list and the member ID is transmitted to the network<br>
for storage in database 60. The process is then<br>
ended. Note that additional members can be added by<br>
traversing this sequence of blocks until the number<br><br>
of allowed members is exceeded or the user sends List<br>
Complete.<br>
If the user input indicated that the requested<br>
function was to add an existing group to the group<br>
list (since nested groups are allowed) , block 92<br>
transfers control to block 102 via the add group<br>
path. Block 102 requests and accepts input for<br>
sequentially adding the members of the group. Also,<br>
block 102 expands the group call list. Next, block<br>
104 determines whether the requested number of<br>
members are within the limit of members for a group<br>
call. Block 104 transfers control to block 106 via<br>
the yes path. Block 106 adds the members to the list<br>
and transmits the member Ids to the network to be<br>
stored in database 60. Then the process is ended.<br>
If the number of members requested exceeds the<br>
limit for members of a dynamic group call, block 104<br>
transfers control to block 108 via the no path.<br>
Block 108 provides feedback to the originating user<br>
10 that the member limit has been exceeded, allowing<br>
the user the opportunity to make the necessary<br>
changes. Then the process is ended, but the user may<br>
continue with selections .<br>
If the user input indicated that the create<br>
dynamic group function has been selected by<br>
originator 10, user input block 92 transfers control<br>
to block 110 via the create dynamic group path.<br>
Block 110 sends the member list or a list complete<br>
indication to the network. Next, network validation<br>
is provided by block 112 . The functionality of the<br>
network validation block 112 will be explained in<br>
FIG. 4 and FIG. 5. If the network validation failed,<br>
block 112 transfers control to block 122 which<br>
provides an indication for feedback to the<br><br>
originating user 10. Then block 122 transfers<br>
control to the main menu, block 116 for subsequent<br>
input from user 10.<br>
If the network validation returned as<br>
acceptable, block 112 transfers control to block 114<br>
via the yes path. Since the network has returned the<br>
group call identity, block 114 adds the group<br>
identity to the address book of the originating user<br>
10. Then block 114 transfers control to the main<br>
menu, block 116 awaiting further user input.<br>
If the user input to block 92 indicated a<br>
dynamic group call having the push-to-talk function<br>
indicated, block 92 transfers control to block 118<br>
via the PTT DGC (push-to-talk, dynamic group call)<br>
path. Block 118 sends the list or list complete<br>
indication along with the push-to-talk (PTT)<br>
indication to the network for actuation of the<br>
dynamic group call. Block 120 represents the network<br>
validation step which will be explained later in FIG.<br>
5. If the network validation step 120 is failed,<br>
block 12 0 transfers control via the no path to block<br>
122. Block 122 provides feedback to the user of the<br>
failed dynamic group call attempt. Block 122 then<br>
transfers control to main menu 116 to wait for the<br>
next user selection.<br>
If the network validates the dynamic group call<br>
and push-to-talk request, block 120 transfers control<br>
to block 124 via the yes path. Block 124 indicates<br>
that the dynamic group call has been initiated as<br>
part of the validation process of FIGs. 4 and 5. In<br>
addition a group ID has been returned to originator<br>
10. Next, block 126 adds the group ID, returned to<br>
originator 10, to the address book of originating<br>
user's mobile unit 10.<br><br>
Referring to FIG. 4, a flow chart of the network<br>
validation corresponding to block 112 and 12 0 of PIG.<br>
3 is shown. FIG. 4 depicts the creation of a dynamic<br>
group call group by the network corresponding to an<br>
user's 10 request.<br>
Network validation is initiated and block 13 0 is<br>
entered. Block 13 0 determines whether it has<br>
received a list from the client, a list complete<br>
indication from the user or a request for adding a<br>
member from the user. If a list of dynamic group<br>
call members has been received, block 130 transfers<br>
control to block 132. Block 132 then transfers<br>
control to block 134. Block 134 determines whether<br>
the list received from user 10 is valid. If the list<br>
is invalid, block 134 transfers control to block 138<br>
via the no path. Block 138 provides feedback via<br>
message transmission to user 10 to indicate that the<br>
attempted addition of a list of members for a group<br>
call is not valid. The process is then ended.<br>
If the list is valid, block 134 transfers<br>
control to block 136 -via the yes path. Block 136<br>
determines whether any group slots are available<br>
within the user's allowable number of defined groups.<br>
If there are available slots in the group definitions<br>
for dynamic group call, block 136 transfers control<br>
to block 140 via the yes path. Block 140<br>
selects/creates a unique group ID for the list of<br>
group members for dynamic group call that the network<br>
has just received. Then block 140 transfers control<br>
to block 144.<br>
If no group definition slots are available,<br>
block 136 transfers control to block 142 via the no<br>
path. An existing group definition is then deleted<br>
for originator 10, block 142, and a new one created<br><br>
associated with the current request. The deleted<br>
group may be based on the first dynamic group<br>
definition input, the last group definition input, or<br>
the least frequently used group definition, for<br>
example. Other methods of maintaining the slots<br>
would be to reuse one of the existing group<br>
definitions and replace the current group membership<br>
with the new one. This would also imply that any TTL<br>
value associated with the old list is modified for<br>
the new definition. Block 142 then transfers control<br>
to block 144 and the processing is the same as that<br>
indicated above after block 144.<br>
Block 144 determines whether a push-to-talk<br>
indication was sent with the member list just<br>
received. If no push-to-talk (PTT) indication was<br>
received block 144 transfers control to block 148 via<br>
the no path. Block 148 sends the group ID just<br>
selected back to user 10 for subsequent storage. The<br>
process is then ended.<br>
If a push-to-talk indication was received along<br>
with the member list, block 144 transfers control to<br>
block 146 via the yes path. Block 146 initiates the<br>
dynamic group call and among other things returns the<br>
group ID to each of the dynamic group call members to<br>
support a call back function as will be explained<br>
infra.<br>
If the network detects a request from user 10 to<br>
receive a complete list from originator 10 with the<br>
PTT function indicated or not, network 13 0 transfers<br>
control to block 150. Block 150 transfers control to<br>
block 130 which determines if there are group slot<br>
definitions available. Subsequent to that the<br>
processing is exactly as indicated supra for the<br>
process following block 134.<br><br>
If network validation block 130 has detected a<br>
request to add a member to a group from user 10,<br>
block 130 transfers control to block 152. Block 152<br>
then transfers control to block 154 which validates<br>
the number to be added to the dynamic group. If the<br>
member is validated, block 154 transfers control to<br>
block 156 via the yes path. Block 156 adds the group<br>
member to the group. Then the process is ended for<br>
this group member. If the member cannot be<br>
validated, block 154 transfers control to block 158<br>
via the no path. Block 158 sends a message back to<br>
user 10 to indicate that the proposed addition of a<br>
member cannot be validated. The validation process<br>
is then ended.<br>
Referring to FIG. 5, a flow chart of the<br>
creation for dynamic group by the network is shown<br>
which includes the optional time to live feature for<br>
each group defined by the network. If the network<br>
validation process as shown in FIG. 3 detects a<br>
request to add a list from user 10, block 160<br>
transfers control to block 162. Block 162 transfers<br>
control to block 164 to validate the list. If the<br>
list is not valid block 164 transfers control to<br>
block 168 via the no path. Block 168 returns a<br>
message to user 10 to indicate that the attempted<br>
addition of a dynamic group list has failed. Then<br>
the process is ended.<br>
If the list of group members is valid, block 164<br>
transfers control to block 166 via the yes path.<br>
Block 166 selects a unique group ID. Next, block 167<br>
selects the time to live (TTL) field 88 of the<br>
particular group entry 81, for example, the TTL value<br>
transmitted by the user 10 may be a variable supplied<br>
by the user or may be a standard network parameter<br><br>
such as a day or a month, or maybe based on the<br>
number of groups available in the network, etc.<br>
Block 167 sets this field in the corresponding<br>
database position 88.<br>
Next, block 168 determines whether the PTT<br>
indication was also sent with the member list. If<br>
the PTT indication is not sent, block 168 transfers<br>
control to block 172 via the no path. Block 172<br>
sends the group ID plus the selected time to live<br>
back to the user 10. The process is then ended.<br>
If the PTT function was indicated in the list<br>
transmitted by the user, block 168 transfers control<br>
to block 170 via the yes path. Block 170 starts the<br>
dynamic group call as will be explained infra with<br>
reference to PIG. 6.<br>
If the network validation process block 160 has<br>
detected the list complete from the user, block 160<br>
transfers control to block 174. Block 174 transfers<br>
control to block 166 to select the unique group ID<br>
and the process is repeated from that point on as<br>
described above after block 166.<br>
If the network validation process block 160<br>
detected a request from the user to add a member to<br>
the dynamic group list, block 160 transfers control<br>
to block 176. Block 176 transfers control to block<br>
178 which determines whether the member is valid. If<br>
the member is valid for the dynamic group, block 178<br>
transfers control to block 180 via the yes path.<br>
Block 180 adds the member to the particular list.<br>
Then the process is ended. If the member is not<br>
valid, block 178 transfers control from block 182 via<br>
the no path. Appropriate feedback messages provided<br>
back to user 10 indicate the failure to add the<br>
member. The process is then ended.<br><br>
FIG. 6 is a flow chart of the establishment or<br>
start for the dynamic group call indicated by an<br>
originator 10 to the network. When the network<br>
receives the PTT indication to initiate the dynamic<br>
group call, block 190 is entered.<br>
Block 192 determines whether the originator is a<br>
valid group member, and whether the group itself is<br>
valid. If the originator or the group itself is not<br>
valid block 192 transfers control to block 194 via<br>
the no path. Block 194 provides feedback of the<br>
inability to go forward with the dynamic group call<br>
due to an invalidity to the originator 10. Then the<br>
process is ended.<br>
If both the group and originator are valid,<br>
block 192 transfers control to block 196 via the yes<br>
path. Block 196 determines whether the group call is<br>
already active. If it is, block 196 transfers<br>
control to block 198. In block 198, since the group<br>
call is already active, a group call member must be<br>
attempting to rejoin the call and this process is<br>
initiated. Then the process is ended.<br>
If the group call is inactive, block 196<br>
transfers control to block 200 via the no path.<br>
Block 200 expands the group list. The group list is<br>
retrieved from the database and a determination is<br>
made of each group call member's IP address. Next,<br>
block 202 launches a call to each of the dynamic<br>
group call members.<br>
Next, block 204 determines whether a first<br>
response from one of the group call members is<br>
received within a time out period. If the response<br>
Vis not received within the time out period, block 204<br>
transfers control to block 206 via the no path.<br>
Block 2 06 indicates to the originating user that the<br><br>
group call has failed. Then the process is ended.<br>
Note that other call start criteria may be used, for<br>
example, an alternative could be that all group call<br>
members must respond within a time out period before<br>
moving to block 208. Or, there may be no time out<br>
period defined at all in which case the control would<br>
be immediately transferred to block 208, whether or<br>
not any group members responded.<br>
If the response is within the time out period,<br>
block 204 transfers control to block 208 via the yes<br>
path. Block 208 confirms the call is successful back<br>
to the originator 10 and bridges each of the members<br>
to the call (legs) to a common link. Next, the group<br>
identity is sent to each of the members that have<br>
responded to the group call, block 210. If the<br>
optional time to live feature is applicable, the time<br>
to live field 88 is also returned to each of the<br>
responding group call members. The talker in the<br>
group call is then arbitrated among the members until<br>
the call is terminated, block 212. The process is<br>
then ended.<br>
FIG. 7 depicts the call back process for a<br>
member of a group who wishes to call back (or<br>
reestablish) a dynamic group call after it has ended.<br>
Once the call back request is detected, block<br>
220 is entered. A similar procedure for call setup<br>
is followed as with other group calls. This<br>
procedure is as described above with reference to<br>
FIG. 6.<br>
The group call member wishing to call back sends<br>
the group ID to the server, block 222. Next, the<br>
network determines a response from the group ID and<br>
member ID. The network determines whether the<br>
request from the group member is for a call<br><br>
reestablishment, rejoining a call in progress, or the<br>
attempt by the group member fails.<br>
If the network determined that the request from<br>
the user was for a call reestablishment, block 224<br>
transfers control to block 226 via the call<br>
reestablishment path. Block 226 re-executes the<br>
method mentioned above for establishing a dynamic<br>
call except the originator now is a member of the<br>
dynamic group and may not be the original originator.<br>
The call is reestablished and dialogue begins. Then<br>
the process is ended.<br>
If the network response is determined to be a<br>
call in progress, block 224 transfers control to<br>
block to 228 via the call in progress path. The user<br>
is then rejoined to a call by the procedure mentioned<br>
above and becomes a listener to the call since the<br>
call is already in progress. Then the process is<br>
ended.<br>
If the detected network response is that the<br>
attempt to reestablish or rejoin the call is failed,<br>
block 224 transfers control to block 230 via the<br>
failure path. Failures may include no response from<br>
the other group members, an invalid group ID, the<br>
time to live (TTL) for the life of the particular<br>
dynamic group call has expired, etc. If a failure is<br>
detected, block 230 provides feedback to the<br>
requesting group member. Then the process is ended.<br>
The dynamic group call method described herein<br>
provides highly selectable and automated group call<br>
services for dispatch or PTT type calls. The dynamic<br>
call method enables individuals to create group call<br>
lists dynamically for group dispatch communications.<br>
Further, the dynamic group call method supports a<br>
call back feature service for each member of the<br><br>
group call. Further, and optionally, each of the<br>
group call member lists may be set to expire at<br>
particular times thereby avoiding clogging the group<br>
call service provided by the network. The group call<br>
services are all provided directly to the end user or<br>
group member without operator intervention. This<br>
method may also operate on a number of networks such<br>
as, GSM, CDMA, UMTS and various wireless or wireline<br>
LANs.<br>
Although the preferred embodiment of the<br>
invention has been illustrated, and that form<br>
described in detail, it will be readily apparent to<br>
those skilled in the art that various modifications<br>
may be made therein without departing from the spirit<br>
