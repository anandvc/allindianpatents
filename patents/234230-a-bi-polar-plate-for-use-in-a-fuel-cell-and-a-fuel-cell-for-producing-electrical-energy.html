				<td>A BI-POLAR PLATE FOR USE IN A FUEL CELL AND A<br>
FUEL CELL FOR PRODUCING ELECTRICAL ENERGY<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a bi-polar plate for use in a fuel cell and a fuel cell<br>
for producing electrical energy and generally to fuel cell technology. In particular, the<br>
invention relates to fuel cells designed for portable applications.<br>
A fuel cell electrochemically combines hydrogen and oxygen to produce<br>
electricity. Fuel cell evolution so far has concentrated on large-scale applications such as<br>
industrial size generators for electrical power back-up.<br>
Consumer electronics devices and other portable electrical power applications<br>
currently rely on lithium ion and similar battery technologies. Demand for alternatives to<br>
these conventional battery technologies increases. The fuel cell industry is racing to<br>
produce a fuel cell small enough to power a portable consumer electronics device, such as<br>
a laptop computer.<br>
Byproducts of the energy-generating electro-chemical reaction in a fuel cell<br>
include water vapor and carbon dioxide. The electro-chemical reaction also generates<br>
heat. In a stack plate fuel cell where numerous plates are stacked together and sandwich<br>
multiple electro-chemical layers, heat dissipation from internal portions of the stack<br>
remains a challenge. Current heat management techniques rely on thermal cooling layers<br>
disposed adjacent to each electro-chemical layer and between each set of plates. For a fuel<br>
cell having a stack of twenty plates and nineteen electro-chemistry layers, conventional<br>
heat removal techniques thus demand nineteen cooling layers. These intermittent heat<br>
dissipation layers significantly increase the fuel cell package thickness, volume, and size.<br>
In view of the foregoing, alternative techniques to manage heat within a fuel cell<br>
would be desirable. In addition, techniques that reduce package size would be highly<br>
beneficial.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to fuel cells that generate electrical energy and<br>
components used within a fuel cell. One aspect of the invention improves fuel cell<br>
thermal management. In this case, a bi-polar plate included the fuel cell stack<br>
comprises one or more heat transfer appendages. Arranging an appendage on an<br>
external portion of the bi-polar plate permits conductive thermal communication<br>
between inner portions of the plate and the external appendage. The appendage thus<br>
enables external thermal regulation of internal portions of a fuel cell stack. The heat<br>
transfer appendage may be integrally formed with the bi-polar plate material to<br>
facilitate conductive thermal communication between inner portions of the bi-polar<br>
plate and heat transfer appendage.<br>
A heat transfer appendage may be used for heating or cooling. For cooling<br>
exothermic and central portions of the fuel cell stack during hydrogen consumption<br>
and energy production, the fuel cell assembly employs a cooling medium that passes<br>
over the heat transfer appendage. This allows internally generated heat within a fuel<br>
cell stack to move from a) a heat generating membrane electrode assembly to central<br>
portions of a bi-polar plate in contact with the membrane electrode assembly, b) from<br>
the central portion of the bi-polar plate through the bi-polar plate substrate to a heat<br>
transfer appendage, and c) from the heat transfer appendage to the cooling medium<br>
for heat exhaust from the fuel cell.<br>
For heating central portions of the fuel cell stack during initial fuel cell warm-<br>
up, an exothermic catalyst is disposed in contact or in the vicinity of the heat transfer<br>
appendage. A heating medium passes over the catalyst to react with the catalyst and<br>
generate heat, which is absorbed by the heat transfer appendage. The heat conducts<br>
through the bi-polar plate to internal portions of the fuel cell stack, e.g., to a<br>
membrane electrode assembly. In this manner, a thermal catalyst and heat transfer<br>
appendage reduces the warm-up time needed to start generating electricity in the fuel<br>
cell.<br>
Heat transfer appendages described herein negate the need for conventional<br>
heat removal layers disposed between plates of a bi-polar plate. Eliminating the<br>
conventional heat removal layers reduces the thickness of a fuel cell stack, and<br>
decreases the fuel cell size and volume.<br>
In addition, eliminating the conventional heat removal layers used between<br>
two plates of a bi-polar plate enables a bi-polar plate having channel fields disposed<br>
on opposing faces of a single plate. Changing a bi-polar plate from the conventional<br>
two plates to a single plate significantly reduces the thickness of a fuel cell stack.<br>
Correspondingly, the fuel cell size and volume also decrease.<br>
Single plate bi-polar plates may also include staggered channel designs that<br>
reduce the thickness of the single plate. The staggered channel designs permit a bi-'<br>
polar plate to have a thickness between opposite faces that is less than 2x, where x is<br>
the approximate depth of a channel used in a channel field. This further reduces the<br>
fuel cell package thickness and size.<br>
Improved thermal management provided by cooling the heat transfer<br>
appendages also permits new channel field and gaseous flow designs that distribute<br>
the reactant gases to a membrane electrode assembly. For example, parallel, cross<br>
flow, co-flow, and counter flow channel field designs are provided herein.<br>
Gas distribution channel fields used in a bi-polar plate may also include one or<br>
more flow buffers that improve delivery of reactant gases and removal of reaction<br>
products. The flow buffers provide common storage areas for flow of gases between<br>
individual channels. If a particular channel becomes blocked or otherwise witnesses a<br>
pressure disturbance or fluctuation, the buffer reduces pressure variance in the flow<br>
field and avoids downstream effects caused by the disturbance. By reducing pressure<br>
variance of gases provided to the membrane electrode assembly, the flow buffers<br>
improve fuel cell performance.<br>
Another innovation described herein for use in a fuel cell relates to pre-bent<br>
end plates that more uniformly apply pressure onto a fuel cell stack.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
The present invention is described in detail with reference to a few preferred<br>
embodiments as illustrated in the accompanying drawings. In the following<br>
description, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough<br>
understanding of the present invention. It will be apparent, however, to one skilled in<br>
the art, that the present invention may be practiced without some or all of these<br>
specific details. In other instances, well known process steps and/or structures have<br>
not been described in detail in order to not unnecessarily obscure the present<br>
invention.<br>
1. FUEL CELL SYSTEM<br>
FIG. 1A illustrates a fuel cell system 10 for producing electrical energy in<br>
accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. Fuel cell system 10<br>
comprises a hydrogen fuel supply 12 and a fuel cell 20.<br>
Hydrogen supply 12 provides hydrogen to fuel cell 20. As shown, supply 12<br>
includes a hydrogen storage device 14 and/or a 'reformed' hydrogen supply. Fuel cell<br>
20 typically receives hydrogen from one supply at a time, although fuel cell systems<br>
10 that employ redundant hydrogen provision from multiple supplies are useful in<br>
some applications. Hydrogen storage device 14 outputs hydrogen, which may be a<br>
pure source such as compressed hydrogen held in a pressurized container 14. A solid-<br>
hydrogen storage system such as a metal-based hydrogen storage device known to<br>
those of skill in the art may also be used for hydrogen storage device 14.<br>
A 'reformed' hydrogen supply processes a fuel source to produce hydrogen.<br>
Fuel source 17 acts as a carrier for hydrogen and can be processed to separate<br>
hydrogen. Fuel source 17 may include any hydrogen bearing fuel stream,<br>
hydrocarbon fuel or other hydrogen fuel source such as ammonia. Currently available<br>
hydrocarbon fuel sources 17 suitable for use with the present invention include<br>
methanol, ethanol, gasoline, propane, butane and natural gas, for example. Several<br>
hydrocarbon and ammonia products may also produce a suitable fuel source 17.<br>
Liquid fuel sources 17 offer high energy densities and the ability to be readily stored<br>
and shipped. Storage device 16 may contain a fuel mixture. When the fuel processor<br>
15 comprises a steam reformer, storage device 16 may contain a fuel mixture of a<br>
hydrocarbon fuel source and water. Hydrocarbon fuel source/water fuel mixtures are<br>
frequently represented as a percentage fuel source in water. In one embodiment, fuel<br>
source 17 comprises methanol or ethanol concentrations in water in the range of 1%-<br>
99.9%. Other liquid fuels such as butane, propane, gasoline, military grade "JP8" etc.<br>
may also be contained in storage device 16 with concentrations in water from 5-<br>
100%. In a specific embodiment, fuel source 17 comprises 67% methanol by volume.<br>
As shown, the reformed hydrogen supply comprises a fuel processor 15 and a<br>
fuel source storage device 16. Storage device 16 stores fuel source 17 and may<br>
include a portable and/or disposable fuel cartridge. A disposable cartridge offers<br>
instant recharging to a consumer. In one embodiment, the cartridge includes a<br>
collapsible bladder design within a hard plastic dispenser case. A separate fuel pump<br>
typically controls fuel source 17 flow from storage device 16. If system 10 is load<br>
following, then fuel source 17 is metered by a control system to deliver fuel source 17<br>
to processor 15 at a flow level necessary for the required power level output of fuel<br>
cell 20.<br>
Fuel processor 15 processes the hydrocarbon fuel source 17 and outputs<br>
hydrogen. Conventional hydrocarbon fuel processors 15 heat and process a fuel<br>
source 17 in the presence of a catalyst to produce the hydrogen. Fuel processor 15<br>
comprises a reformer, which is a catalytic device that converts a liquid or gaseous<br>
hydrocarbon fuel source 17 into hydrogen and carbon dioxide. Several types of<br>
reformers suitable for use in fuel cell system 10 include steam reformers, auto thermal<br>
reformers (ATR) or catalytic partial oxidizers (CPOX). Steam reformers only need<br>
steam to produce hydrogen, whereas ATR and CPOX reformers mix air with the fuel<br>
and steam mix. ATR and CPOX systems reform fuels such as methanol, diesel,<br>
regular unleaded gasoline and other hydrocarbons. In a specific embodiment, storage<br>
device 16 provides methanol 17 to fuel processor 15, which reforms the methanol at<br>
about 250°C or less and allows fuel cell system 10 use in applications where<br>
temperature is to be minimized. Further description of a fuel processor suitable for<br>
use with the present invention is included in commonly owned co-pending patent<br>
application entitled "Annular Fuel Processor and Methods" naming Ian Kaye as<br>
inventor and filed on the same day as this patent application. This application is<br>
incorporated by reference for all purposes.<br>
Fuel cell 20 electrochemically converts hydrogen and oxygen to water,<br>
generating electricity and heat in the process. Ambient air commonly supplies oxygen<br>
for fuel cell 20. A pure or direct oxygen source may also be used for oxygen supply.<br>
The water often forms as a vapor, depending on the temperature of fuel cell 20<br>
components. The electrochemical reaction also produces carbon dioxide as a<br>
byproduct for many fuel cells.<br>
In one embodiment, fuel cell 20 is a low volume polymer electrolyte<br>
membrane (PEM) fuel cell suitable for use with portable applications such as<br>
consumer electronics. A polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell comprises a<br>
membrane electrode assembly 40 that carries out the electrical energy generating<br>
electrochemical reaction. The membrane electrode assembly includes a hydrogen<br>
catalyst, an oxygen catalyst and an ion conductive membrane that a) selectively<br>
conducts protons and b) electrically isolates the hydrogen catalyst from the oxygen<br>
catalyst. A hydrogen gas distribution layer contains the hydrogen catalyst and allows<br>
the diffusion of hydrogen therethrough. An oxygen gas distribution layer contains the<br>
oxygen catalyst and allows the diffusion of oxygen and hydrogen protons<br>
therethrough. The ion conductive membrane separates the hydrogen and oxygen gas<br>
distribution layers. In chemical terms, the anode comprises the hydrogen gas<br>
distribution layer and hydrogen catalyst, while the cathode comprises the oxygen gas<br>
distribution layer and oxygen catalyst.<br>
In one embodiment, the membrane electrode assembly is disposed between<br>
two plates. Hydrogen distribution 43 occurs via a channel field on one plate while<br>
oxygen distribution 45 occurs via a channel field on a second facing plate.<br>
Specifically, a first channel field distributes hydrogen to the hydrogen gas distribution<br>
layer, while a second channel field distributes oxygen to the oxygen gas distribution<br>
layer. A PEM fuel cell often includes a fuel cell stack having a set of bi-polar plates.<br>
The term 'bi-polar' plate refers to a structure incorporating reactant gas flow channels<br>
on two faces (whether comprised of one plate or two plates) that is sandwiched<br>
between two membrane electrode assembly layers. In this case, the bi-polar plate acts<br>
as both a negative terminal for one adjacent membrane electrode assembly and a<br>
positive terminal for the other adjacent membrane electrode assembly.<br>
In electrical terms, the anode includes the hydrogen gas distribution layer,<br>
hydrogen catalyst and bi-polar plate. The anode acts as the negative electrode for fuel<br>
cell 20 and conducts electrons that are freed from hydrogen molecules so that they<br>
can be used externally, e.g., to power an external circuit. In a fuel cell stack, the bi-<br>
polar plates are connected in series to add the potential gained in each layer of the<br>
stack. In electrical terms, the cathode includes the oxygen gas distribution layer,<br>
oxygen catalyst and bi-polar plate. The cathode represents the positive electrode for<br>
fuel cell 20 and conducts the electrons back from the external electrical circuit to the<br>
oxygen catalyst, where they can recombine with hydrogen ions and oxygen to form<br>
water.<br>
The hydrogen catalyst breaks the hydrogen into protons and electrons. The ion<br>
conductive membrane blocks the electrons, and electrically isolates the chemical<br>
anode (hydrogen gas distribution layer and hydrogen catalyst) from the chemical<br>
cathode (see FIG. 2C). The ion conductive membrane also selectively conducts<br>
positively charged ions. Electrically, the anode conducts electrons to a load<br>
(electricity is produced) or battery (energy is stored). Meanwhile, protons move<br>
through the ion conductive membrane, to combine with oxygen. The protons and used<br>
electrons subsequently meet on the cathode side, and combine with oxygen to from<br>
water. The oxygen catalyst in the oxygen gas distribution layer facilitates this<br>
reaction. One common oxygen catalyst comprises platinum powder very thinly coated<br>
onto a carbon paper or cloth. Many designs employ a rough and porous catalyst to<br>
increase surface area of the platinum exposed to the hydrogen and oxygen.<br>
In one embodiment, fuel cell 20 comprises a set of bi-polar plates that each<br>
includes channel fields on opposite faces that distribute the hydrogen and oxygen.<br>
One channel field distributes hydrogen while a channel field on the opposite face<br>
distributes oxygen. Multiple bi-polar plates can be stacked to produce a 'fuel cell<br>
stack' (FIG. 2A) in which a membrane electrode assembly is disposed between each<br>
pair of adjacent, bi-polar plates.<br>
Since the electrical generation process in fuel cell 20 is exothermic, fuel cell<br>
20 implements a thermal management system to dissipate heat from the fuel cell. Fuel<br>
cell 20 may also employ a number of humidification plates (HP) to manage moisture<br>
levels in the fuel cell.<br>
While the present invention will mainly be discussed with respect to PEM fuel<br>
cells, it is understood that the present invention may be practiced with other fuel cell<br>
architectures. The main difference between fuel cell architectures is the type of ion<br>
conductive membrane used. In one embodiment, fuel cell 20 is phosphoric acid fuel<br>
cell that employs liquid phosphoric acid for ion exchange. Solid oxide fuel cells<br>
employ a hard, non-porous ceramic compound for ion exchange and may be suitable<br>
for use with the present invention. Generally, any fuel cell architecture may benefit<br>
from one or more bi-polar plate and thermal management improvements described<br>
herein. Other such fuel cell architectures include direct methanol, alkaline and molten<br>
carbonate fuel cells.<br>
Fuel cell 20 generates dc voltage that may be used in a wide variety of<br>
applications. For example, electricity generated by fuel cell 20 may be used to power<br>
a motor or light. In one embodiment, the present invention provides 'small' fuel cells<br>
that are designed to output less than 200 watts of power (net or total). Fuel cells of<br>
this size are commonly referred to as 'micro fuel cells' and are well suited for use<br>
with portable electronics. In one embodiment, fuel cell 20 is configured to generate<br>
from about 1 milliwatt to about 200 watts. In another embodiment, fuel cell 20<br>
generates from about 3 W to about 20W. Fuel cell 20 may also be a stand-alone fuel<br>
cell, which is a single unit that produces power as long as it has an a) oxygen and b)<br>
hydrogen or a hydrocarbon fuel supply. A fuel cell 20 that outputs from about 40W to<br>
about 100W is well suited to power a laptop computer. Power levels greater than 80<br>
kW can be achieved by significantly increasing the number of cells to 100-300 cells<br>
and increasing the plate area.<br>
FIG. 1B schematically illustrates the operation of fuel cell system 10 in<br>
accordance with a specific embodiment of the present invention. As shown, fuel cell<br>
system 10 comprises fuel container 16, hydrogen fuel source 17, fuel processor 15,<br>
fuel cell 20, multiple pumps 21 and fans 35, fuel lines and gas lines, and one or more<br>
valves 23.<br>
Fuel container 16 stores methanol as a hydrogen fuel source 17. An outlet 26<br>
of fuel container 16 provides methanol 17 into hydrogen fuel source line 25. As<br>
shown, line 25 divides into two lines: a first line 27 that transports methanol 17 to a<br>
burner 30 for fuel processor 15 and a second line 29 that transports methanol 17 to<br>
reformer 32 in fuel processor 15. Lines 25, 27 and 29 may comprise plastic tubing,<br>
for example. Separate pumps 21a and 21b are provided for lines 27 and 29,<br>
respectively, to pressurize the lines and transmit the fuel source at independent rates if<br>
desired. A model P625 pump as provided by Instech of Plymouth Meeting, PA is<br>
suitable to transmit liquid methanol for system 10 is suitable in this embodiment. A<br>
flow sensor or valve 23 situated on line 29 between storage device 16 and fuel<br>
processor 18 detects and communicates the amount of methanol 17 transfer between<br>
storage device 16 and reformer 32. In conjunction with the sensor or valve 23 and<br>
suitable control, such as digital control applied by a processor that implements<br>
instructions from stored software, pump 21b regulates methanol 17 provision from<br>
storage device 16 to reformer 32.<br>
Fan 35a delivers oxygen and air from the ambient room through line 31 to<br>
regenerator 36 of fuel processor 15. Fan 35b delivers oxygen and air from the<br>
ambient room through line 33 to regenerator 36 of fuel processor 15. In this<br>
embodiment, a model AD2005DX-K70 fan as provided by Adda USA of California<br>
is suitable to transmit oxygen and air for fuel cell system 10. A fan 37 blows cooling<br>
air over fuel cell 20 and its heat transfer appendages 46. Cooling of fuel cell 20 via<br>
heat transfer appendages 46 will be described below in more detail with respect to<br>
FlGs. 2D, 2E and 3A.<br>
Fuel processor 15 receives methanol 17 from storage device 16 and outputs<br>
hydrogen. Fuel processor 15 comprises burner 30, reformer 32, boiler 34 and<br>
regenerator 36. Burner 30 includes an inlet that receives methanol 17 from line 27<br>
and a catalyst that generates heat with methanol presence. In one embodiment, burner<br>
30 includes an outlet that exhausts heated gases to a line 41, which transmits the<br>
heated gases to fuel cell 20 for passage over heat transfer appendages 46 to pre-heat<br>
the fuel cell and expedite warm-up time needed when initially turning on fuel cell 20.<br>
An outlet of burner 30 may also exhaust heated gases into the ambient room.<br>
Boiler 34 includes an inlet that receives methanol 17 from line 29. The<br>
structure of boiler 34 permits heat produced in burner 30 to heat methanol 17 in boiler<br>
34 before reformer 32 receives the methanol 17. Boiler 34 includes an outlet that<br>
provides heated methanol 17 to reformer 32.<br>
Reformer 32 includes an inlet that receives heated methanol 17 from boiler<br>
34. A catalyst in reformer 32 reacts with the methanol 17 and produces hydrogen and<br>
carbon dioxide. This reaction is slightly endothermic and draws heat from burner 30.<br>
A hydrogen outlet of reformer 32 outputs hydrogen to line 39. In one embodiment,<br>
fuel processor 15 also includes a preferential oxidizer that intercepts reformer 32<br>
exhaust and decreases the amount of carbon monoxide in the exhaust. The<br>
preferential oxidizer employs oxygen from an air inlet to the preferential oxidizer and<br>
a catalyst, such as ruthenium or platinum, which is preferential to carbon monoxide<br>
over carbon dioxide.<br>
In one embodiment, fuel processor 15 includes a dewar 150 that pre-heats air<br>
before the air enters burner 30. Dewar 150 also reduces heat loss from fuel cell 15 by<br>
heating the incoming air before it escapes fuel processor 15. In one sense, dewar 150<br>
acts as a regenerator that uses waste heat in fuel processor 15 to increase thermal<br>
management and thermal efficiency of the fuel processor. Specifically, waste heat<br>
from burner 30 may be used to pre-heat incoming air provided to burner 30 to reduce<br>
heat transfer to the air in the burner so more heat transfers to reformer 32.<br>
Line 39 transports hydrogen from fuel processor 15 to fuel cell 20. Gaseous<br>
delivery lines 31, 33 and 39 may comprise plastic tubing, for example. A hydrogen<br>
flow sensor (not shown) may also be added on line 39 to detect and communicate the<br>
amount of hydrogen being delivered to fuel cell 20. In conjunction with the hydrogen<br>
input sensor and suitable control, such as digital control applied by a processor that<br>
implements instructions from stored software, fuel processor 15 regulates hydrogen<br>
gas provision to fuel cell 20.<br>
Fuel cell 20 includes an hydrogen inlet port 84 (FIG. 2B) that receives<br>
hydrogen from line 39 and delivers it to a hydrogen intake manifold (FIG. 2E) for<br>
delivery to one or more bi-polar plates and their hydrogen distribution channels. An<br>
oxygen inlet port 88 (FIG. 2B) receives oxygen from line 33 and delivers it to an<br>
oxygen intake manifold (FIG. 2E) for delivery to one or more bi-polar plates and their<br>
oxygen distribution channels. An anode exhaust manifold collects gases from the<br>
hydrogen distribution channels and delivers them to an anode exhaust port, which<br>
outlets the exhaust gases into the ambient room. A cathode exhaust manifold collects<br>
gases from the oxygen distribution channels and delivers them to a cathode exhaust<br>
port. In one embodiment, the cathode exhaust gases are routed to line 41, which<br>
transmits the heated gases over heat transfer appendages 46 of fuel cell 20 to pre-heat<br>
the fuel cell and expedite warm-up time needed when initially turning on fuel cell 20.<br>
The schematic operation for fuel cell system 10 shown in FIG. 1B is<br>
exemplary and other variations on fuel cell system design, such as reactant and<br>
byproduct plumbing, are contemplated. In one embodiment, the present invention<br>
routes anode exhaust from fuel cell 20 back to burner 30. Since hydrogen<br>
consumption within fuel cell 20 is often incomplete and exhaust from the hydrogen<br>
distribution channels includes unused hydrogen, re-routing the exhaust to burner 30<br>
allows fuel cell system 10 to capitalize on the unused portions and increase hydrogen<br>
usage and efficiency in system 10. Further description of this embodiment and<br>
additional schematic examples of fuel cell system 10 are described in commonly<br>
owned co-pending patent application entitled "Annular Fuel Processor and Methods",<br>
which was incorporated by reference above. In addition to the components shown in<br>
shown in FIG. 1B, system 10 may also include other elements such as electronic<br>
controls, additional pumps and valves, added system sensors, manifolds, heat<br>
exchangers and electrical interconnects useful for carrying out functionality of system<br>
10 which are known to one of skill in the art and omitted herein for sake of brevity.<br>
2. FUEL CELL<br>
FIG. 2A illustrates a cross sectional view of a fuel cell stack 60 for use in fuel<br>
cell 20 in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. FIG. 2B<br>
illustrates an outer top perspective view of a fuel cell stack 60 and fuel cell 20 in<br>
accordance with another embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Referring initially to FIG. 2A, fuel cell stack 60 is a bi-polar plate stack that<br>
comprises a set of bi-polar plates 44 and a set of membrane electrode assembly<br>
(MEA) layers 62. Two MEA layers 62 neighbor each bi-polar plate 44. With the<br>
exception of topmost and bottommost membrane electrode assembly layers 62a and<br>
62b, each MEA 62 is disposed between two adjacent bi-polar plates 44. For MEAs<br>
62a and 62b, top and bottom end plates 64a and 64b include a channel field 72 on the<br>
face neighboring an MEA 62. Bi-polar plates 44 are discussed in further detail with<br>
respect to FIGs. 2B-2L 3, 4 and 5. Membrane electrode assembly 62 is discussed in<br>
further detail with respect to FIG. 2C.<br>
Referring to FIG. 2B, top and bottom end plates 64a and 64b provide<br>
mechanical protection for stack 60. End plates 64 also hold the bi-polar plates 44 and<br>
MEA layers 62 together, and apply pressure across the planar area of each bi-polar<br>
plate 44 and each MEA 62. End plates 64 may comprise a suitably rigid material such<br>
as stainless steel, titanium, aluminum, a composite, or ceramic, for example. In one<br>
embodiment, end plates 64 are pre-bent before assembly to reduce pressure variance<br>
across the planar area of MEA layers 62. Pre-bent end plates are discussed in further<br>
detail below with respect to FIG. 6.<br>
Bolts 82a and 82b connect and secure top and bottom end plates 64a and 64b<br>
together. As shown, bolts 82a and 82b enter through top end plate 64a and thread into<br>
receiving threads in bottom end plate 64b. Nuts may alternatively be disposed on the<br>
bottom side of bottom end plate 64b to receive and secure each bolt. Bolts 82a and<br>
82b may comprise commercially available bolts, tie rods or another fastening<br>
mechanism suitable for connecting and securing top and bottom end plates 64a and<br>
64b.<br>
Referring back to FIG. 2A, bi-polar plate stack 60 includes twelve membrane<br>
electrode assembly layers 62, eleven bi-polar plates 44 and two end plates 64. The bi-<br>
polar plates 44 in stack 60 also each include two heat transfer appendages 46. More<br>
specifically, each bi-polar plate 44 includes a heat transfer appendage 46a on one side<br>
of the plate and a heat transfer appendage 46b on the opposite side. Heat transfer<br>
appendages 46 are discussed in further detail below with respect to FIGs. 2E, 3A and<br>
3B.<br>
The number of bi-polar plates 44 and MEA layers 62 in each set may vary<br>
with design of fuel cell stack 60. Stacking parallel layers in fuel cell stack 60 permits<br>
efficient use of space and increased power density for fuel cell 20. In one<br>
embodiment, each membrane electrode assembly 62 produces 0.7 V and the number<br>
of MEA layers 62 is selected to achieve a desired voltage. Alternatively, the number<br>
of MEA layers 62 and bi-polar plates 44 may be determined by the allowable<br>
thickness in an electronics device. Using one or more space savings techniques<br>
described below, fuel cell 20 may include more than 10 membrane electrode<br>
assembly layers and yet have an overall package thickness less than one centimeter. A<br>
fuel cell stack 60 having from one MEA 62 to several hundred MEAs 62 is suitable<br>
for many applications. A stack 60 having from about three MEAs 62 to about twenty<br>
MEAs 62 is also suitable for numerous applications. Fuel cell 20 size and layout may<br>
also be tailored and configured to output a given power.<br>
Referring to FIG. 2B, fuel cell 20 includes two anode ports that open to the<br>
outside of fuel cell stack 60: an inlet anode port or inlet hydrogen port 84, and an<br>
outlet anode port or outlet hydrogen port 86. Inlet hydrogen port 84 is disposed on top<br>
end plate 64a, couples with an inlet line to receive hydrogen gas, and opens to an inlet<br>
hydrogen manifold 102 (see FIGs. 2E and 2F) that is configured to deliver inlet<br>
hydrogen gas to a channel field 72 on each bi-polar plate 44 in the stack 60. Outlet<br>
port 86 receives outlet gases from an anode exhaust manifold 104 (see FIGs. 2E and<br>
2F) that is configured to collect waste products from the anode channel fields 72 of<br>
each bi-polar plate 44. Outlet port 86 may provide the exhaust gases to the ambient<br>
room directly or a line that couples to port 86 and outlets the exhaust gases to the<br>
ambient room.<br>
Fuel cell 20 includes two cathode parts: an inlet cathode port or inlet oxygen<br>
port 88, and an outlet cathode port or outlet water/vapor port 90. Inlet oxygen port 88<br>
is disposed on bottom end plate 64b (see FIG. 2F), couples with an inlet line to<br>
receive ambient air, and opens to an oxygen manifold 106 that is configured to<br>
deliver inlet oxygen and ambient air to a channel field 72 on each bi-polar plate 44 in<br>
stack 60. Outlet water/vapor port 90 receives outlet gases from a cathode exhaust<br>
manifold 108 (see FIGs. 2E and 2F) that is configured to collect water (typically as a<br>
vapor) from the cathode channel fields 72 on each bi-polar plate 44.<br>
FIG. 2C illustrates a polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell (PEMFC)<br>
architecture 120 for use in fuel cell 20 in accordance with one embodiment of the<br>
present invention. As shown, PEMFC architecture 120 comprises two bi-polar plates<br>
44 and a membrane electrode assembly layer (or MEA) 62 sandwiched between the<br>
two bi-polar plates 44. The MEA 62 electrochemically converts hydrogen and oxygen<br>
to water, generating electricity and heat in the process. Membrane electrode assembly<br>
62 includes an anode gas diffusion layer 122, a cathode gas diffusion layer 124, a<br>
hydrogen catalyst 126, ion conductive membrane 128, anode electrode 130, cathode<br>
electrode 132, and oxygen catalyst 134.<br>
Pressurized hydrogen gas (H2), such as that provided in a hydrogen bearing<br>
gas stream (or 'reformate'), enters fuel cell 20 via hydrogen port 84, proceeds through<br>
inlet hydrogen manifold 102 and through hydrogen channels 74 of a hydrogen<br>
channel field 72a disposed on the anode face 75 of bi-polar plate 44a. The hydrogen<br>
channels 74 open to anode gas diffusion layer 122, which is disposed between the<br>
anode face 75 of bi-polar plate 44a and ion conductive membrane 128. The pressure<br>
forces hydrogen gas into the hydrogen-permeable anode gas diffusion layer 122 and<br>
across the hydrogen catalyst 126, which is disposed in the anode gas diffusion layer<br>
122. When an H2 molecule contacts hydrogen catalyst 126, it splits into two H+ ions<br>
(protons) and two electrons (e-). The protons move through the ion conductive<br>
membrane 128 to combine with oxygen in cathode gas diffusion layer 124. The<br>
electrons conduct through the anode electrode 130, where they build potential for use<br>
in an external circuit (e.g., a power supply of a laptop computer) After external use,<br>
the electrons flow to the cathode electrode 132 of PEMFC architecture 120.<br>
Hydrogen catalyst 126 breaks hydrogen into protons and electrons. Suitable<br>
catalysts 126 include platinum, ruthenium, and platinum black or platinum carbon,<br>
and/or platinum on carbon nanotubes, for example. Anode gas diffusion layer 122<br>
comprises any material that allows the diffusion of hydrogen therethrough and is<br>
capable of holding the hydrogen catalyst 126 to allow interaction between the catalyst<br>
and hydrogen molecules. One such suitable layer comprises a woven or non-woven<br>
carbon paper. Other suitable gas diffusion layer 122 materials may comprise a silicon<br>
carbide matrix and a mixture of a woven or non-woven carbon paper and Teflon.<br>
On the cathode side of PEMFC architecture 120, pressurized air carrying<br>
oxygen gas (O2) enters fuel cell 20 via oxygen port 88, proceeds through inlet oxygen<br>
manifold 106, and through oxygen channels 76 of an oxygen channel field 72b<br>
disposed on the cathode face 77 of bi-polar plate 44b. The oxygen channels 76 open<br>
to cathode gas diffusion layer 124, which is disposed between the cathode face 77 of<br>
bi-polar plate 44b and ion conductive membrane 128. The pressure forces oxygen<br>
into cathode gas diffusion layer 124 and across the oxygen catalyst 134 disposed in<br>
the cathode gas diffusion layer 124. When an O2 molecule contacts oxygen catalyst<br>
134, it splits into two oxygen atoms. Two H+ ions that have traveled through the ion<br>
selective ion conductive membrane 128 and an oxygen atom combine with two<br>
electrons returning from the external circuit to form a water molecule (H2O). Cathode<br>
channels 76 exhaust the water, which usually forms as a vapor. This reaction in a<br>
single MEA layer 62 produces about 0.7 volts.<br>
Cathode gas diffusion layer 124 comprises a material that permits diffusion of<br>
oxygen and hydrogen protons therethrough and is capable of holding the oxygen<br>
catalyst 134 to allow interaction between the catalyst 134 with oxygen and hydrogen.<br>
Suitable gas diffusion layers 124 may comprise carbon paper or cloth, for example.<br>
Other suitable gas diffusion layer 124 materials may comprise a silicon carbide<br>
matrix and a mixture of a woven or non-woven carbon paper and Teflon. Oxygen<br>
catalyst 134 facilitates the reaction of oxygen and hydrogen to form water. One<br>
common catalyst 134 comprises platinum. Many designs employ a rough and porous<br>
catalyst 134 to increase surface area of catalyst 134 exposed to the hydrogen or<br>
oxygen. For example, the platinum may reside as a powder very thinly coated onto a<br>
carbon paper or cloth cathode gas diffusion layer 124.<br>
Ion conductive membrane 128 electrically isolates the anode from the<br>
cathode by blocking electrons from passing through membrane 128. Thus, membrane<br>
128 prevents the passage of electrons between gas diffusion layer 122 and gas<br>
diffusion layer 124. Ion conductive membrane 128 also selectively conducts<br>
positively charged ions, e.g., hydrogen protons from gas diffusion layer 122 to gas<br>
diffusion layer 124. For fuel cell 20, protons move through membrane 128 and<br>
electrons are conducted away to an electrical load or battery. In one embodiment, ion<br>
conductive membrane 128 comprises an electrolyte. One electrolyte suitable for use<br>
with fuel cell 20 is Celtec 1000 from PEMEAS USA AG of Murray Hill, NJ<br>
(www.pemeas.com). Fuel cells 20 including this electrolyte are generally more<br>
carbon monoxide tolerant and may not require humidification. Ion conductive<br>
membrane 128 may also employ a phosphoric acid matrix that includes a porous<br>
separator impregnated with phosphoric acid. Alternative ion conductive membranes<br>
128 suitable for use with fuel cell 20 are widely available from companies such as<br>
United technologies, DuPont, 3M, and other manufacturers known to those of skill in<br>
the art. For example, WL Gore Associates of Elkton, MD produces the primea Series<br>
58, which is a low temperature MEA suitable for use with the present invention.<br>
Anode 130 refers to the lower potential or negative electrode for MEA layer<br>
62 and conducts electrons that are freed from hydrogen molecules so they can be used<br>
externally. Anode 130 comprises anode gas diffusion layer 122, catalyst 126 and the<br>
electrically conductive nature of bi-polar plate 44. Thus, bi-polar plate 44 thus serves<br>
as both a) a plate with channels 76 formed into it that distribute hydrogen gases over<br>
an active area including catalyst 126 and b) an electrically conducting member of<br>
anode 130 in fuel cell 20. For fuel cell stack 60, the bi-polar plates 44 are connected<br>
in series to add the potential generated in each MEA 62. The cumulative anode 130<br>
for fuel cell 20 then includes each bi-polar plate 44 connected in series and conducts<br>
electrons to an external electrical load (electricity is used) or battery (energy is<br>
stored).<br>
Cathode 132 represents the positive electrode for fuel cell 20 and conducts<br>
electrons to catalyst 134, where they can recombine with hydrogen ions and oxygen<br>
to form water. Cathode 132 comprises cathode gas diffusion layer 124, catalyst 134<br>
and the electrically conductive nature of bi-polar plate 44. Thus, bi-polar plate 44<br>
serves as both a) a plate with channels 76 formed into it that distribute oxygen and air<br>
over an active area including catalyst 134 and b) an electrically conducting member<br>
of cathode 132 in fuel cell 20. The cumulative cathode 132 for fuel cell 20 includes<br>
each bi-polar plate 44 connected in series to conduct electrons back from the external<br>
electrical circuit.<br>
In one embodiment, fuel cell 20 requires no external humidifier or heat<br>
exchanger and the stack 60 only needs hydrogen and air to produce electrical power.<br>
Alternatively, fuel cell 20 may employ humidiflcation of the cathode to fuel cell 20<br>
improve performance. For some fuel cell stack 60 designs, humidifying the cathode<br>
increases the power and operating life of fuel cell 20. FIG. 2F illustrates<br>
humidification plates 160 employed in a fuel stack 60 in accordance with one<br>
embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Humidification plates 160 comprise a substantially planar geometry and are<br>
defined by two opposing faces 162 that each include a humidification flow field 164<br>
is disposed on each face 162 (only the top face and humidification flow field 164 are<br>
shown). A water permeable membrane 168 (such as Nation) is disposed between each<br>
humidification plate 160. Cathode exhaust gas (from the bi-polar plates 44 that<br>
service MEA layers 62) is fed through one humidification flow field 164 of a<br>
humidification plate 160 and the cathode inlet gas (going to the bi-polar plates 44 that<br>
service MEA layers 62) is fed through the other humidification flow field 164. The<br>
membrane 168 allows water vapor to pass from one stream to the other, without<br>
allowing the different gas streams to mix. Water vapor and heat from the cathode<br>
exhaust stream is thus fed into the cathode inlet stream through the water permeable<br>
membrane 168, hence humidifying and heating the cathode inlet stream. The<br>
humidification flow fields 164 may be configured to allow counter flow, co-flow or<br>
cross flow between the cathode inlet and outlet streams.<br>
In one embodiment, fuel cell stack 60 includes a number of humidification<br>
plates that is about 25-70% of the total number of bi-polar plates 44.Humidification<br>
plates 160 may be molded or machined plastic plates, for example. Humidification<br>
plates 160 need not be thermally or electrically conductive.<br>
Although the present invention provides a bi-polar plate 44 having channel<br>
fields 72 that distribute hydrogen and oxygen on opposing sides of a single plate 44,<br>
many embodiments described herein are suitable for use with conventional bi-polar<br>
plate assemblies that employ two separate plates for distribution of hydrogen and<br>
oxygen. FIG. 2M illustrates a widely used and conventional bi-polar plate 300 that<br>
comprises a plate/cooling layer/plate architecture.<br>
Bi-polar plate 300 includes two plates 302a and 302b that sandwich a cooling<br>
layer 304. Top plate 302a includes a channel field 306a on its top face 308 that<br>
distributes oxygen. Bottom plate 302b includes a channel field 306b on its bottom<br>
face 308 that distributes hydrogen (or oxygen when top plate 302a distributes<br>
hydrogen). Cooling layer 304 runs a cooling medium such as de-ionized water<br>
through cooling channels 310. The cooling medium actively cools each plate 302.<br>
The cooling medium may be routed such that the temperature increase occurs in the<br>
same direction as reducing oxygen partial pressure in the cathode. Similar to bi-polar<br>
plate 44, bi-polar plate 300 is referred to as a 'bi-polar plate' since it acts electrically<br>
as a cathode for one MEA and as an anode for another MEA. Bi-polar plate 300<br>
serves similar functions for a fuel cell as those described above for bi-polar plate 44.<br>
Top and bottom plates 302a and 302b may each comprise silicon with channels<br>
etched in their faces to provide channel fields 306.<br>
Although use of bi-polar plate 300 in fuel cell 20 leads to a thicker fuel cell<br>
relative to use of bi-polar plate 44, many embodiments of the present invention are<br>
well suited for use with bi-polar plate 300. For example, flow buffers as described<br>
with respect to FIG. 2E are well suited for used with bi-polar plate 300. In addition,<br>
fuel cells including bi-polar plates 300 in a stack will benefit from pre-bent end plates<br>
64 as discussed with respect to FIG. 6. Bi-polar plate 300 may also employ staggered<br>
channels, heating appendages and/or flow fields as described herein.<br>
In one embodiment, fuel cell 20 comprises bi-polar plates 44 that are arranged<br>
in a stack where each plate 44 has a different manifold layout. FIG. 2F illustrates a<br>
fuel cell stack 60 design where bi-polar plates include different inlet and exhaust<br>
distributions in accordance with another embodiment of the present invention.<br>
For fuel stack 60 of FIG. 2F, the cathode gas stream 170 enters from the<br>
bottom plate 64b (where it may be closest to the air supply) and flows through two<br>
humidifier plate fields 164, flowing counter flow to the cathode exit streams, thereby<br>
picking up humidity and heat. The cathode gas stream 170 then flows through three<br>
MEAs 62 and to cathode exit manifold 108, which returns the stream 170 to<br>
humidification plates 160 where it passes over the incoming cathode gas stream 170.<br>
The cathode gas stream 170 is then exhausted from outlet port 90.<br>
The anode stream 172 enters an inlet port 84 and flows serially from one top<br>
bi-polar plate 44 to the next, flowing counter flow to the cathode gas stream 170. The<br>
stream 172 first enters the bi-polar plate 44 that is the last bi-polar plate 44 in the<br>
cathode stream 170. Flowing the anode stream 172 and cathode stream 170 counter<br>
flow to each other reduces the cell potential loss associated with decreasing fuel and<br>
oxidant concentrations, since they are consumed by each of the MEA layers 62.<br>
These fuel cell stack 60 flow paths permit a shorter plumbing path for<br>
reformate and cathode exit streams to and from the fuel processor. To enable this<br>
improved plumbing, the fuel cell stack 60 design shown in FIG. 2J demonstrates bi-<br>
polar plate 44 configurations that are each tailored for the specific location of the<br>
plate 44 in the fuel cell stack 60. More specifically, bi-polar plates 44m, 44n and 44o<br>
may each include a different inlet and exhaust manifold arrangements. For example,<br>
bi-polar plate 44o includes an extra cathode manifold 107 that bi-polar plate 44m<br>
does not. MEMs fabrication techniques, for example, allow for such varying manifold<br>
arrangements to be incorporated into bi-polar plates 44. The varying manifold<br>
arrangements then enable designers to develop complex flow patterns for bi-polar<br>
fuel cell stacks 60 with minimal additional cost.<br>
While the present invention has mainly been discussed so far with respect to a<br>
reformed methanol fuel cell (RMFC), the present invention may also apply to other<br>
types of fuel cells, such as a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC), a phosphoric acid fuel cell<br>
(PAFC), a direct methanol fuel cell (DMFC), or a direct ethanol fuel cell (DEFC). In<br>
this case, fuel cell 20 includes components specific to these architectures, as one of<br>
skill in the art will appreciate. A DMFC or DEFC receives and processes a fuel. More<br>
specifically, a DMFC or DEFC receives liquid methanol or ethanol, respectively,<br>
channels the fuel into the fuel cell stack 60 and processes the liquid fuel to separate<br>
hydrogen for electrical energy generation. For a DMFC, channel fields 72 in the bi-<br>
polar plates 44 distribute liquid methanol instead of hydrogen. Hydrogen catalyst 126<br>
described above would then comprise a suitable anode catalyst for separating<br>
hydrogen from methanol. Oxygen catalyst 128 would comprise a suitable cathode<br>
catalyst for processing oxygen or another suitable oxidant used in the DMFC, such as<br>
peroxide. In general, hydrogen catalyst 126 is also commonly referred to as an anode<br>
catalyst in other fuel cell architectures and may comprise any suitable catalyst that<br>
removes hydrogen for electrical energy generation in a fuel cell, such as directly from<br>
the fuel as in a DMFC. In general, oxygen catalyst 128 may include any catalyst that<br>
processes an oxidant in used in fuel cell 20. The oxidant may include any liquid or<br>
gas that oxidizes the fuel and is not limited to oxygen gas as described above. An<br>
SOFC, PAFC or MCFC may also benefit from inventions described herein, for<br>
example. In this case, fuel cell 20 comprises an anode catalyst 126, cathode catalyst<br>
128, anode fuel and oxidant according to a specific SOFC, PAFC or MCFC design.<br>
3. BI-POLAR PLATES<br>
FIG. 2D illustrates top perspective view of a bi-polar plate 44 in accordance<br>
with one embodiment of the present invention. FIG. 2E illustrates a top elevated view<br>
of bi-polar plate 44. Bi-polar plate 44 is a single plate 44 with a first channel field 72a<br>
and a second channel field 72b disposed on opposite faces 75a and 75b, respectively,<br>
of a single plate 44.<br>
Functionally, bi-polar plate 44 a) delivers and distributes reactant gasses to the<br>
gas diffusion layers 122 and 124 and their respective catalysts, b) maintains<br>
separation of the reactant gasses from one another between MEA layers 62 in stack<br>
60, c) exhausts electrochemical reaction byproducts from MEA layers 62, d)<br>
facilitates heat transfer to and/or from MEA layers 62 and fuel cell stack 60, e) acts as<br>
an electronic conductor to transport electrons from the anode to the cathode, and f)<br>
includes gas intake and gas exhaust manifolds for gas delivery to other bi-polar plates<br>
44 in the fuel stack 60.<br>
Structurally, bi-polar plate 44 has a relatively flat profile and includes<br>
opposing top and bottom faces 75 a and 75b (only top face 75 a is shown in FIGs. 2D<br>
and 2E, see FIG. 2C for 75b) and a number of sides 78. Faces 75 are substantially<br>
planar with the exception of channels 76 formed as troughs into substrate 89. Sides 78<br>
comprise portions of bi-polar plate 44 proximate to edges of bi-polar plate 44<br>
between the two faces 75. As shown in FIG. 2E, bi-polar plate 44 is roughly<br>
quadrilateral with features for the intake manifolds, exhaust manifolds and heat<br>
transfer appendage 46 that provide deviation from the quadrilateral shape. A bi-polar<br>
plate 44 thickness from about 0.125 millimeters to about 1 millimeter between faces<br>
75 is suitable for many applications. Other applications may employ a thickness<br>
between about 0.25 millimeters to about 0.75 millimeters.In a specific embodiment,<br>
plate 44 has a thickness no greater than about 2 millimeters at any point in the plate<br>
44 profile. In another embodiment, plate 44 has an original thickness of 1mm before<br>
any machining. In this case, fuel cells 20 having an overall package thickness less<br>
than 1cm are attainable.<br>
The manifold on each plate 44 is configured to deliver a gas to a channel field<br>
on a face of the plate 44 or receive a gas from the channel field 72. The manifolds for<br>
bi-polar plate 44 include apertures or holes in substrate 89 that, when combined with<br>
manifolds of other plates 44 in a stack 60, form an inter-plate 44 gaseous<br>
communication manifold (such as 102,104,106 and 108). Thus, when plates 44 are<br>
stacked and their manifolds substantially align, the manifolds permit gaseous<br>
delivery to and from each plate 44.<br>
Bi-polar plate 44 includes a channel field 72 or "flow field" on each face of<br>
plate 44. Each channel field 72 includes one or more channels 76 formed into the<br>
substrate 89 of plate 44 such that the channel rests below the surface of plate 44. Each<br>
channel field 72 distributes one or more reactant gasses to an active area 85 for the<br>
fuel cell stack 60. Bi-polar plate 44 includes a first channel field 72a on the anode<br>
face 75a of bi-polar plate 44 that distributes hydrogen to an anode (FIG. 2C), while a<br>
second channel field on opposite cathode face 75b distributes oxygen to a cathode.<br>
Specifically, channel field 72a includes multiple channels 76 that permit oxygen and<br>
air flow to anode gas diffusion layer 122, while channel field 72b includes multiple<br>
channels 76 that permit oxygen and air flow to cathode gas diffusion layer 124. For<br>
fuel cell stack 60, each channel field 72 is configured to receive a reactant gas from<br>
an intake manifold 102 or 106 and configured to distribute the reactant gas to a gas<br>
diffusion layer 122 or 124. Each channel field 72 also collects reaction byproducts for<br>
exhaust from fuel cell 20. When bi-polar plates 44 are stacked together in fuel cell 60,<br>
adjacent plates 44 sandwich an MEA layer 62 such that the anode face 75a from one<br>
bi-polar plate 44 neighbors a cathode face 75b of an adjacent bi-polar plate 44 on an<br>
opposite side of the MEA layer 62.<br>
Each channel field 72 includes a set of channels configured to distribute<br>
oxygen to an active area of the bi-polar plate. The number and configuration of<br>
channels 76 in each channel field 72 may vary with design. FIGs. 2G-2L show<br>
several channel field 72 configurations suitable for use with fuel cell 20.<br>
An active area 85 for fuel cell 20 refers to a portion of the fuel cell stack 60 in<br>
which an electrochemical reaction for energy production occurs. Typically, an active<br>
area 85 requires both the functionality of MEA layer 62 (and its constituent parts such<br>
as gas distribution layers 122 and 124, associated catalysts, and ion conductive<br>
membrane 128) and gas distribution by channel fields 72. Thus, areas of the MEA<br>
layer 62 serviced by the channel fields 72 may define active areas 85. Conversely,<br>
areas outside the distribution and planar area of channel fields 72 are not included in<br>
the active area 85, and areas outside the planar area of MEA layer 62 are not included<br>
in the active area 85. Depending on configuration, a single MEA layer 62 may<br>
include multiple active areas 85.The multiple active areas 85 need not be continuous<br>
and a single MEA layer need not be restricted to a single continuous active area 85.<br>
Channel fields 72 are located in a central portion of plate 44. A sealing portion<br>
87 of plate 44 borders channel field 72 about the periphery of each plate 44. The<br>
sealing portion 87 surrounds the channel fields 72 and surrounds manifolds 102-108<br>
about the periphery of plate 44. The sealing portion 87 seals the MEA layer 62 and<br>
manifolds 102-108. A gasket may be disposed between the sealing portions 87 of<br>
adjacent plates 44 to facilitate a tight seal. Pressure from bolts 82 and end plates 64<br>
then compresses a gasket between each pair of adjacent plates 44. A screen printed<br>
gasket made from silicone is suitable for many fuel cell stacks 60. In another<br>
embodiment, substrate 89 is raised for bi-polar plate 44 at sealing portion 87 relative<br>
to substrate 89 in the central portion of plate 44. In this case, MEA layer 62 rests in<br>
the lower recessed portion and the raised substrate 89 in sealing portions 87 of<br>
adjacent plates 44 acts as the seal when pressed together by bolts 82 and end plates<br>
64.<br>
Channel fields 72 affect the performance of fuel cell 20. More specifically,<br>
design of channel fields 72 may alter the planar consistency of gas distribution<br>
between bi-polar plates 44, which affects electrical power output. One embodiment of<br>
the present invention improves fuel cell 20 performance by tailoring channel fields 72<br>
according to the design of fuel cell 20. In general, since fuel cell 20 employs lateral<br>
heat conduction for heat removal during energy production, and each bi-polar plate<br>
44 operates at a substantially constant temperature, one or more of the following<br>
parameters may affect configuration and layout of channel fields 72: maximizing a<br>
Nernst potential across the membrane electrode assembly 62, optimized water<br>
management in the fuel cell stack 60 (water partial pressure distribution and liquid<br>
water removal), electric resistance, and/or optimizing pressure consistency or drop in<br>
the individual layers.<br>
FIGs. 2G-2L illustrate several exemplary channel fields 72a-72g suitable for<br>
use with fuel cell 20. In one embodiment, channel fields 72 disposed on opposing<br>
faces of adjacent bi-polar plates 44 in fuel cell 20 distribute oxygen and hydrogen gas<br>
in directions counter to each other to maximize the Nernst potential of the cell.<br>
As shown in FIG. 2G, a channel field 72a on the bottom (or top) of bi-polar<br>
plate 44a starts oxygen flow in an upper left corner 250 and finishes oxygen flow in a<br>
lower right corner 252. In this case, the oxygen intake duct 106 provides fresh oxygen<br>
to upper left corner 250 and the air exhaust duct 108 (FIG. 2E) receives depleted<br>
oxygen air from lower right corner 252. Conversely, opposing channel field 72b on<br>
the top (or bottom) facing surface of adjacent bi-polar plate 44b starts hydrogen flow<br>
in the lower right corner 252 and finishes hydrogen flow in upper left corner 250.<br>
Similarly, the hydrogen intake duct 102 provides fresh hydrogen to lower right corner<br>
252 and the hydrogen exhaust duct 104 receives depleted hydrogen from upper left<br>
corner 250. The flow patterns shown in FIG. 2F are exemplary and it is understood<br>
that channel field 72a may distribute oxygen as described or conversely channel field<br>
72a may distribute hydrogen to the anode while channel field 72b distributes oxygen<br>
to the cathode.<br>
As shown in FIG. 2H, channel fields 72c and 72d on opposing faces of<br>
adjacent bi-polar plates 44c and 44d follow a similar planar flow pattern, but in<br>
opposing directions. More specifically, channel field 72c starts oxygen flow in a first<br>
portion 254a of a lower left corner 254 of bi-polar plate 44c and finishes oxygen flow<br>
in a second portion 254b of the lower left corner 254. Between start and finish on the<br>
same corner, channel field 72c distributes oxygen about bi-polar plate 44c along an<br>
exemplary circuitous path that covers the active area serviced by bi-polar plate 44c.<br>
More elaborate distribution paths are possible and contemplated. Channel field 72d<br>
conversely starts oxygen flow in a matching second portion 254b of a lower left<br>
corner 254 of bi-polar plate 44d and finishes oxygen flow in a matching first portion<br>
254a of the lower left corner 254. In this case, channel field 72d traces the same<br>
circuitous path as channel field 72c, but in an opposite direction.<br>
Channel distribution patterns illustrated in FIGs. 2G and 2H show serial flow<br>
patterns in which flow in each channel field 72a-d follows a single channel as it<br>
traverses the plate 44 face and active area. Bi-polar plates 44 of the present invention<br>
may also employ parallel channel field schemes in which flow proceeds along<br>
multiple paths between one or more common flow terminals along the flow path. As<br>
shown in FIG. 21, channel fields 72e and 72f on opposing faces of adjacent bi-polar<br>
plates 44e and 44f follow counter-parallel paths. More specifically, channel field 72e<br>
starts oxygen flow in an upper right corner 256 of bi-polar plate 44e and finishes<br>
oxygen flow in a lower left corner 258. Oxygen flow from upper right comer 256 of<br>
plate 44e divides at a common flow terminal 264 into six substantially parallel<br>
channels 266 that deliver the oxygen across the plate 44e face and active area before<br>
recombining at common flow terminal 268 near lower left corner 258. Conversely,<br>
hydrogen flow from upper left corner 257 of plate 44f divides at a common flow<br>
terminal 265 into six substantially parallel channels 267 that deliver the oxygen<br>
across the plate 44e face and active area before recombining at common flow<br>
terminal 269 near lower right corner 259. In this manner, channel fields 72e and 72f<br>
deliver and distribute hydrogen and oxygen in counter directions across the active<br>
areas serviced by bi-polar plates 44e and 44f.<br>
FIG. 2K shows channel fields 72i and 72j on opposing faces of adjacent bi-<br>
polar plates 44i and 44j that follow a "co-flow" pattern in the same direction. In this<br>
case, the fields 72i and 72j start and finish oxygen and hydrogen flow at the same<br>
sides of each plate 44. FIG. 2L shows channel fields 72i and 72k on opposing faces of<br>
adjacent bi-polar plates 44i and 44k that follow a "cross-flow" pattern in a<br>
perpendicular direction.<br>
Bi-polar plates 44 for fuel cell 20 may also use combined techniques<br>
described above. For example, FIG. 2J illustrates channel fields 72g and 72g on<br>
opposing faces of adjacent bi-polar plates 44g and 44h that employ a parallel scheme<br>
and serial scheme, respectively.<br>
Bi-polar plate 44 comprises a substrate 89 that represents the one or more<br>
materials on which channels 72 are formed. Substrate 89 materials may be adapted<br>
based on application. In one embodiment, substrate 89 comprises a thermally<br>
conductive material. Advantages and usage of thermally conductive bi-polar plates 44<br>
are described below with respect to FIGs. 3A, 3B and 5. In a specific embodiment,<br>
each plate 44 is thermally conductive and substrate includes a thermal conductance<br>
greater than 1 W/mK. A thermally conductive substrate 89 may comprise a metal such<br>
as aluminum or copper or comprise a graphite-composite material. Other materials<br>
suitable for use with substrate 89 include 316SS or 316SSL stainless steel, 50/50<br>
nickel chrome, titanium, Fe, Ni, Cr and their alloys.<br>
In another embodiment, substrate 89 comprises an electrically conductive<br>
material. Metals such as aluminum and copper are thus suitable for use for use with<br>
bi-polar plate 44. Alternatively, substrate 89 may comprise a non-electrically<br>
conductive material such as silicon or glass. In this case, plate 44 is coated with an<br>
electrically conductive layer that increases electrical conductance of bi-polar plate 44.<br>
Electrically conductive substrates 89 permit bi-polar plate 44 to have an overall<br>
thickness substantially less than graphite composite plates, which reduces the stack 60<br>
thickness and size.<br>
Bi-polar plate 44 may also include one or more coatings applied over substrate<br>
89. For example, a coating may be added to serve as a corrosion barrier for a metal<br>
substrate 89. Suitable corrosion coatings may comprise a non-corroding polymeric<br>
matrix or a pure polymeric material, for example.<br>
Bi-polar plate 44 may also be coated with an electrically conductive metal<br>
alloy or polymeric materials to improve conductance. The electrically conductive<br>
coating a) increases the planar electrical conductivity of bi-polar plate 44 between<br>
central portions of the substrate and peripheral portions that include heat transfer<br>
appendages 46, and b) enhances current transfer between bi-polar plate 44 and MEA<br>
62. The conductive coating also serves as an electronic conduction path when the<br>
plates 44 are formed from non-conductive materials. The electrically conductive layer<br>
may include graphite, a conductive metal alloy or polymeric material for example. In<br>
one embodiment, planar resistance through bi-polar plate 44 is commonly less than<br>
100 mOhm cm2, whether achieved with a conductive substrate 89 material or via an<br>
external conductive coating.<br>
Some coatings may be applied to serve as both a corrosion barrier and as an<br>
electrically conductive layer. For example, a non-corroding ceramic material that<br>
features high electrical conductivity will both increase electrical conductivity and act<br>
as a corrosion barrier. Similarly, a polymeric material mixed with a blend of<br>
electrically conductive materials such as graphite powder or carbon nano-tubes of<br>
different or similar sizes will also dually serve as both a corrosion barrier and as an<br>
electrically conductive layer. Conductive anti-corrosion coating materials fur use with<br>
plate 44 having a surface resistance less than 100mO cm2 include most metals,<br>
conductive ceramics and polymers, pure chemical or alloy. Some specific examples<br>
include Titanium Carbide, Titanium Carbonitride, Niobium, rhenium, titanium<br>
boride, chromium nitride, Au, Ni, Cu, Ti, CR, Mo and their alloys, conductive<br>
ceramics, graphite composite, conductive polymer includes, polypyrrole,<br>
polyphenylene, polyanilne, etc, homopolymer and copolymer compounds.<br>
The relatively small size of fuel cell 20 and bi-polar plates 44 permits the use<br>
of non-traditional and relatively expensive coatings on bi-polar plates 44. The<br>
relatively expensive coatings may comprise gold, titanium carbide, titanium nitride or<br>
composite materials, for example. Fuel cell manufactures of large fuel cells (2kW and<br>
up) typically avoid costly plate coatings due to the high cost of coating many square<br>
meters of material. However, for small fuel cells 20, the low cost of the molded plate<br>
and the performance increase associated with an integrated plate (increased<br>
performance reduces the overall size of the plates 44, reduces the MEA 62 size and<br>
amount of catalyst required), and outweighs the cost of the coating. The use of gold<br>
and other costly coatings for fuel cell 20 thus further demonstrates fuel cell 20<br>
novelty relative to conventional large fuel cell technology for which the use of gold<br>
on plates larger than two square feet would be costly.<br>
Bi-polar plates 44 may be constructed using a number of techniques. In one<br>
embodiment, metal bi-polar plates 44 are micro-machined from a metal sheet. Metal<br>
sheets may also be molded, cast, stamped or machined (e.g., milled) to form the bi-<br>
polar plate 44, channels 76 and flow fields 72. MEMS manufacturing techniques<br>
advantageously permit bi-polar plate 44 features to differ from fuel cell to fuel cell<br>
with minimal increase in plate 44 cost. For example, varying channel fields 72 as<br>
described with respect to FIGs. 2G-2L may be easily achieved in low volumes. In<br>
addition, inlet and outlet manifolds and gas ports can be placed in different locations<br>
for individual bi-polar plates 44 of a single fuel cell stack 60 to suit an orientation of a<br>
particular fuel cell 20 design or to permit strategic flows between plates 44 (see<br>
discussion for FIG. 2F).<br>
4. STAGGERED CHANNELS<br>
In one embodiment of the present invention, bi-polar plates 44 include<br>
'staggered' channels 76 that a) reduce the thickness of bi-polar plates 44 and/or b)<br>
reduce local forces applied by adjacent bi-polar plates 44 onto MEA layer 62<br>
components. FIG. 4A illustrates staggered channels 76 disposed on a bi-polar plate 44<br>
in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. FIG. 4B illustrates bi-<br>
polar plates 44c and 44d disposed on opposite sides of MEA layer 62 in accordance<br>
with another embodiment of the present invention. The bi-polar fuel stack 60 of FIG.<br>
2A also includes staggered channels 76.<br>
A depth 270 for channel 76a is determined by the distance, perpendicular to<br>
the surface of plate 44, into the substrate that a channel bottom 275 penetrates or<br>
opens to. As shown in FIG. 4A, channels 76a and 76b on opposite faces 75a and 75b<br>
of a single bi-polar plate 44 are laterally offset such that the channels 76a and 76b do<br>
not intersect with, each other as they penetrate into substrate 89. This permits a<br>
channel 76a included in a first channel field 72a on the top face to have a channel<br>
depth 270 that extends past a channel depth 272 for a channel 76b included in a<br>
channel field 72b on opposite face 75b of the same bi-polar plate. Channels 76a on a<br>
channel field 72 a for one face of bi-polar plate 44 are thus all staggered such that they<br>
do not laterally intercept (along a direction coplanar with a surface of face 75a) any<br>
channels 76b in channel field 72b. An overlapping depth extension 276 quantifies the<br>
amount by which a channel bottom from one channel 76a approximately extends<br>
beyond a channel bottom from a channel 76b on the opposite surface of a common bi-<br>
polar plate. The overlapping depth extension 276 may be represented by an intended<br>
extension in design or an average extension in manufacture and implementation.<br>
Conversely, bi-polar plates 44 of FIG. 3A illustrate conventional and non-<br>
staggered channels 76. In this case, channels on opposing faces of the same bi-polar<br>
plate 44 align with each other vertically. The bi-polar plate 44 thickness is then<br>
limited to being at least: the depth of a channel on one face plus the depth of a<br>
channel on the opposite face plus a thickness of substrate material between the two<br>
channels 76. For example, a conventional and non-staggered bi-polar plate having<br>
channel depths of 20 mils and a thickness of substrate 89 material between the two<br>
channels of 10 mils provides a bi-polar plate with a 50 mil thickness. However,<br>
staggered channels 76 as shown in FIG. 4B may extend past each other and permit<br>
thinner bi-polar plates 44. With an overlapping depth extension 276 of 10 mils for<br>
example, a bi-polar plate 44 having the same 20 mil channels 76 would only have a<br>
thickness of 30 mils, which correlates to a 40% savings in thickness. For a fuel cell<br>
stack 60 having fifty bi-polar plates 44, this con-elates to an inch less in thickness for<br>
the fuel cell stack 60 and fuel cell 20.<br>
Staggered channels of the present invention thus permit bi-polar plate 44 to<br>
include a channel 76b having a channel bottom 275 that extends past a mid-section of<br>
plate 44. In general, staggered channels 76 of the present invention permit bi-polar<br>
plate 44 to have a thickness 280 less than 2x, where x is the approximate depth of<br>
channels used on each face 75 of the plate 44. In one embodiment, bi-polar plates 44<br>
of the present invention include channels 76 on either face 75 of plate 44 with a<br>
channel depth 270 and 272 greater than 10 mils. In this case, bi-polar plate 44<br>
includes a thickness 280 less than 20 mils. In another embodiment, bi-polar plates 44<br>
of the present invention include channels 76 on either face 75 of plate 44 with a<br>
channel depth 270 and 272 greater than 20 mils. In this case, bi-polar plate 44<br>
includes a thickness 280 less than 40 mils.<br>
A landing surface area 274 on face 75 of plate 44 characterizes and quantifies<br>
the lateral offset 274 between channels 76a and 76b on opposite faces 75 a and 75b.<br>
Planar area included in the landing surface area 274 spans the thickness of plate 44<br>
between the opposite faces of the bi-polar plate 44. When bi-polar plates 44 are<br>
layered in a fuel cell stack 60 and as shown in FIGs. 4B and 2A, facing channels 76<br>
(e.g., channels 76c and 76d) on opposing faces of adjacent bi-polar plates 44 are<br>
staggered such that they do not overlap. This permits landing surface areas 274 on<br>
opposing faces of adjacent bi-polar plates 44 to at least partially overlap on opposite<br>
sides of MEA layer 62.<br>
A channel width 277 quantifies the planar width of a channel 76 relative to a<br>
face of plate 44. m one embodiment, the ratio of lateral offset 274 (A) to channel<br>
width 277 (B) is proportional to conductivity for stack 60. In some cases, A/B is<br>
inversely proportional to the maximum current density. A/B ratios between about<br>
1/10 and about 3 are suitable for many applications. An A/B ratio of about 1/2 is also<br>
acceptable.<br>
The bi-polar plates 44 of FIG. 3A illustrate conventional and non-staggered<br>
channels 76 in which the channels substantially align. While FIG. 3A exaggerates the<br>
thickness of MEA layer 62 for illustration, the thickness of FIG. 3A in reality is often<br>
minimal (less than 1 millimeter) and often gets pinched in channels 76 of adjacent bi-<br>
polar plates 44. For example, MEA layer 62 may comprise one or more compliant<br>
carbon layers as gas distribution layers 122 and 124. Since the pressure on layers of<br>
the fuel cell stack 60 applied by bolts 80 can surpass 100 psi, the compliant MEA<br>
layers can easily be forced into channels 76, compressed, pinched, and compromised.<br>
In contrast, landing surface areas 274c and 274d on adjacent bi-polar plates<br>
44c and 44d of FIG. 4B at least partially overlap in one or more lateral directions 91<br>
of the plate 44 surfaces. This provides a common lateral surface 93 of contact through<br>
the MEA 62 between plates 44c and 44d. The common surface increases the surface<br>
area interaction between neighboring plates 44 and permits regions of common<br>
mechanical support and reduced pressure between bi-polar plates 44c and 44d. This<br>
reduces local stresses on MEA layer 62.<br>
In one embodiment, the common lateral surface 93 includes at least half the<br>
surface area of bi-polar plate 44c disposed between a channel 76c on plate 44c and a<br>
nearest channel 76d on plate 44d. In another embodiment, the common lateral surface<br>
93 includes at least ten percent of the surface area of bi-polar plate 44c disposed<br>
between two adjacent channels 76 on plate 44c.<br>
5. FLOW BUFFERS<br>
The present invention also provides bi-polar plates 44 that include flow<br>
buffers to improve delivery of reactant gases and removal of reaction products. FIG.<br>
2E illustrates a flow buffer 150 for improving gas flow in a fuel cell in accordance<br>
with one embodiment of the present invention. Plate 44 includes a channel field 72<br>
divided into four channel sets 76e-76i. Each channel set includes multiple<br>
substantially straight and substantially parallel channels 76.<br>
Bi-polar plate includes four flow buffers 150a-d. Flow buffer 150a is<br>
configured to receive oxygen from four manifold channels 76e that receive oxygen<br>
from inlet oxygen manifold 106. The manifold channels 76e provide gaseous<br>
communication between flow buffer 150a and oxygen manifold 106. Flow buffer<br>
150a is also configured to output the oxygen to five channels 76f that span the width<br>
of an active area for plate 44 and provide gaseous communication between flow<br>
buffer 150a and flow buffer 150b. Flow buffer 150b is configured to receive oxygen<br>
from the five channels 76f and output the oxygen into five channels 76g (via the<br>
higher pressure in channels 76f than in channels 76g). Flow buffer 150c is configured<br>
to receive oxygen from the five channels 76g and output the oxygen into five<br>
channels 76h. Flow buffer 150d is configured to receive oxygen from the five<br>
channels 76h and output the oxygen into three channels 76i, which provide the<br>
oxygen to output manifold 108.<br>
Since each channel 76 for the cathode side of bi-polar plate 44 also collects<br>
waste products of the electrochemical reaction, each channel 76 shown in FIG. 2E is<br>
also responsible for the collection of waste products. Flow buffers 150 thus also<br>
facilitate the removal of byproducts from MEA 62. In addition, although flow buffers<br>
150a-d will be described with respect to servicing the cathode side of bi-polar plate<br>
44, it is understood that the opposite side of bi-polar plate 44 may include one or<br>
more buffers 150 to improve gaseous flow on the anode side and delivery of<br>
hydrogen.<br>
Flow buffers 150 provide common storage areas for flow of oxygen between<br>
channels 76 and permit for more robust gaseous flow for each channel field 72. If an<br>
individual channel 76 becomes blocked or otherwise witnesses a pressure disturbance<br>
or fluctuation, the downstream buffer 150 it feeds minimizes downstream<br>
compromise caused by the pressure disturbance. The downstream buffer 150c<br>
accommodates a sudden pressure change in a single channel 76 in channel set 76g by<br>
permitting the four other channels 76 in set 76g that supply gas to buffer 150c to feed<br>
all five channels that outlet from buffer 150c.Traditionally, a channel serially<br>
traverses across a large portion of a plate with multiple bends and services a large<br>
portion of the MEA. In the event of a blockage, all downstream portions of this serial<br>
channel become compromised, resulting in a large proportion of the MEA losing gas<br>
delivery and functionality (especially if the blockage occurs early). Conversely, if one<br>
of the channels 76 in channel set 76g becomes blocked or otherwise altered, gaseous<br>
accumulation in flow buffer 150c prevents the local disturbance from compromising<br>
gaseous provision to the remainder of the plate 44. Flow buffer 150c is configured<br>
with a volume that reduces pressure differences between the blocked channel 76 and<br>
another channel in set 76g before outputting oxygen to a channel 76 in channel set<br>
76h. In one embodiment, a flow buffer includes a volume ten times that of a single<br>
flow channel. For a flow buffer 150 having the same depth the flow channels 76, the<br>
flow buffer may then include ten times the surface area of a single flow channel. A<br>
ratio of channel 76 thickness (d) to buffer thickness (D) may also be used when the<br>
flow buffer 150 and flow channels 76 share a common depth. Thickness ratios (d/D)<br>
from about Vz to about 1/20 are suitable for some applications.<br>
In addition, an upstream buffer also helps to overcome a pressure disturbance<br>
or fluctuation in a channel by passively feeding other channels according to the<br>
pressure change. In the previous example, if one of the channels 76 in channel set 76g<br>
becomes blocked or otherwise altered, buffer 150b witnesses a pressure increase due<br>
to the upstream blockage and re-routes gases down the other four channels 76 in<br>
channel set 76g. Buffer 150c then sees a substantially similar pressure despite the<br>
blockage.<br>
By minimizing effects of local pressure fluctuations, buffers 150 thus equalize<br>
pressure distribution and reduce pressure variance for an active area serviced by bi-<br>
polar plate 44. This improves fuel cell 20 performance. Although the bi-polar plate 44<br>
shown in FIG. 2E includes four flow buffers 150, it is understood that bi-polar plate<br>
44 my include more or less buffers 150 depending in the layout of channel field 72. In<br>
one embodiment, bi-polar plate 44 includes from one to ten buffers 150.<br>
6. HEAT MANAGEMENT<br>
The present invention also improves thermal management of a fuel cell. To do<br>
so, a bi-polar plate may include one or more heat transfer appendages. FIG. 2E<br>
illustrates a top elevated view of a bi-polar plate 44 including one heat transfer<br>
appendage 46. FIG. 3A illustrates a cross sectional view of a fuel cell stack 60<br>
including one heat transfer appendage 46 disposed on each bi-polar plate 44 in<br>
accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. FIG. 3B illustrates a cross<br>
section of a heat transfer appendage 46 and plate 44 in accordance with one<br>
embodiment of the present invention. FIG. 2A illustrates a cross sectional view of a<br>
fuel cell stack 60 including two heat transfer appendages 46 disposed on each bi-polar<br>
plate 44.<br>
Heat transfer appendage 46 permits external thermal management of internal<br>
portions of fuel cell stack 60. More specifically, appendage 46 may be used to heat or<br>
cool internal portions of fuel cell stack 60 such as internal portions of each attached<br>
bi-polar plate 44 and any neighboring MEA layers 62, for example. Heat transfer<br>
appendage 46 is laterally arranged outside channel field 72. Lateral arrangement<br>
refers to position or arrangement according to a flat surface of plate 44. Planar<br>
coordinates such as linear coordinates 91a and 91b on a surface of plate 44 (FIG. 2E)<br>
are helpful to characterize planar arrangements for plate 44. Thus, lateral arrangement<br>
outside channel field 72 refers to heat transfer appendage 46 being disposed outside<br>
channel field 72 according to the planar coordinates 91a and 91b. In one embodiment,<br>
appendage 46 is disposed on an external portion of bi-polar plate 44. External<br>
portions of bi-polar plate 44 include any portions of plate 44 proximate to a side or<br>
edge of the substrate included in plate 44. External portions of bi-polar plate 44<br>
typically do not include a channel field 72. For the embodiment shown in FIG. 2E,<br>
heat transfer appendage 46 substantially spans a side of plate 44 that does not include<br>
intake and output manifolds 102-108. For the embodiment shown in FIG. 2A, plate<br>
44 includes two heat transfer appendages 46a and 46b that substantially span both<br>
sides of plate 44 that do not include a gas manifold.<br>
Peripherally disposing heat transfer appendage 46 allows heat transfer<br>
between inner portions of plate 44 and the externally disposed appendage 46 via the<br>
plate substrate 89. Conductive thermal communication refers to heat transfer between<br>
bodies that are in contact or that are integrally formed. Thus, lateral conduction of<br>
heat between external portions of plate 44 (where the heat transfer appendage 46<br>
attaches) and central portions of bi-polar plate 44 occurs via conductive thermal<br>
communication through substrate 89. In one embodiment, heat transfer appendage 46<br>
is integral with substrate material 89 in plate 44. Integral in this sense refers to<br>
material continuity between appendage 46 and plate 44. An integrally formed<br>
appendage 46 may be formed with plate 44 in a single molding, stamping, machining<br>
or MEMs process of a single metal sheet, for example. Integrally forming appendage<br>
46 and plate 44 permits conductive thermal communication and heat transfer between<br>
inner portions of plate 44 and the heat transfer appendage 46 via substrate 89. In<br>
another embodiment, appendage 46 comprises a material other than that used in<br>
substrate 89 that is attached onto plate 44 and conductive thermal communication and<br>
heat transfer occurs at the junction of attachment between the two attached materials.<br>
Heat may travel to or form the heat transfer appendage 46. In other words,<br>
appendage 46 may be employed as a heat sink or source. Thus, heat transfer<br>
appendage 46 may be used as a heat sink to cool internal portions of bi-polar plate 44<br>
or an MEA 62. Fuel cell 20 employs a cooling medium to remove heat from<br>
appendage 46. Alternatively, heat transfer appendage 46 may be employed as a heat<br>
source to provide heat to internal portions of bi-polar plate 44 or an MEA 62. In this<br>
case, a catalyst is disposed on appendage 46 to generate heat in response to the<br>
presence of a heating medium.<br>
For cooling, heat transfer appendage 46 permits integral conductive heat<br>
transfer from inner portions of plate 44 to the externally disposed appendage 46.<br>
During hydrogen consumption and electrical energy production, the electrochemical<br>
reaction generates heat in each MEA 62. Since internal portions of bi-polar plate 44<br>
are in contact with the MEA 62, a heat transfer appendage 46 on a bi-polar plate 44<br>
thus cools an MEA 62 adjacent to the plate via a) conductive heat transfer from MEA<br>
62 to bi-polar plate 44 and b) lateral thermal communication and conductive heat<br>
transfer from central portions of the bi-polar plate 44 in contact with the MEA 62 to<br>
the external portions of plate 44 that include appendage 46. In this case, heat transfer<br>
appendage 46 sinks heat from substrate 89 between a first channel field 72 on one<br>
face 75 of plate 44 and a second channel field 72 on the opposite face 75 of plate 44<br>
to heat transfer appendage 46 in a direction parallel to a face 75 of plate 44. When a<br>
fuel cell stack 60 includes multiple MEA layers 62, lateral thermal communication<br>
through each bi-polar plate 44 in this manner provides interlayer cooling of multiple<br>
MEA layers 62 in stack 60 - including those layers in central portions of stack 60.<br>
Fuel cell 20 employs a cooling medium that passes over heat transfer<br>
appendage 46. The cooling medium receives and removes heat from appendage 46.<br>
Heat generated internal to stack 60 thus conducts through bi-polar plate 44, to<br>
appendage 46, and heats the cooling medium via convective heat transfer between the<br>
appendage 46 and cooling medium. Air is suitable for use as the cooling medium.<br>
As shown in FIG. 3B, heat transfer appendage 46 may be configured with a<br>
thickness 194 that is less than the thickness 196 betweqn opposite faces 75 of plate<br>
44. In one embodiment, thickness 194 is less than about one half of thickness 196. In<br>
another embodiment, thickness 194 is about one-third the thickness 196. The reduced<br>
thickness of appendages 46 on adjacent bi-polar plates 44 in the fuel cell stack 60<br>
forms a channel 190 (see FIG. 3A). Multiple adjacent bi-polar plates 44 and<br>
appendages 46 in stack form numerous channels 190. Each channel 190 permits a<br>
cooling medium to pass therethrough and across heat transfer appendages 46. In one<br>
embodiment, fuel cell stack 60 includes a mechanical housing 197 that encloses and<br>
protects stack 60 (see FIG. 5A). Walls 199 of housing 197 also provide additional<br>
ducting for the heating medium by forming ducts between adjacent appendages 46<br>
and walls 197.<br>
The cooling medium may be a gas or liquid. Heat transfer advantages gained<br>
by high conductance bi-polar plates 44 allow air to be used as a cooling medium to<br>
cool heat transfer appendages 46 and stack 60. For example, a dc-fan may be attached<br>
to an external surface of the mechanical housing. The fan moves air through a hole in<br>
the mechanical housing, through channels 190 to cool heat transfer appendages 46<br>
and fuel cell stack 60, and out an exhaust hole or port in the mechanical housing. Fuel<br>
cell system 10 may then include active thermal controls. Increasing or decreasing<br>
coolant fan speed regulates the amount of heat removal from stack 60 and the<br>
operating temperature for stack 60. In one embodiment of an air-cooled stack 60, the<br>
coolant fan speed increases or decreases as a function of the actual cathode exit<br>
temperature, relative to a desired temperature set-point.<br>
Thermal conduction through bi-polar plates 44 and high thermal conductivity<br>
in each bi-polar plate 44 provides improved thermal uniformity for stack 60. In one<br>
embodiment, each bi-polar plate includes a thermal conductance greater than lW/mK.<br>
High thermal conductivity in this range permits a maximum temperature gradient in<br>
each plate 44 less than 2°F, for example. Thermal conduction through bi-polar plates<br>
44 thus increases the thermal stability of stack 60, which increases the performance<br>
and life of fuel cell 20. Heat transfer appendages 46 also permits a smaller stack 60<br>
size relative to conventional methods of disposing intermittent heat removal layers<br>
between the bi-polar plates 44.<br>
For heating, heat transfer appendage 46 allows integral heat transfer from the<br>
externally disposed appendage 46 to inner portions of plate 44. The electrochemical<br>
reaction responsible for hydrogen consumption and electrical energy generation<br>
typically requires an elevated temperature. Start temperatures greater then 150<br>
degrees Celsius are common.<br>
In one embodiment, fuel cell comprises a catalyst 192 disposed in contact<br>
with, or in proximity to, a heat transfer appendage 46. The catalyst 192 generates heat<br>
when a heating medium passes over it. The heating medium is any gas or fluid that<br>
reacts with catalyst 192 to generate heat. Typically, catalyst 192 and the heating<br>
medium employ an exothermic chemical reaction to generate the heat. Heat transfer<br>
appendage 46 and plate 44 then transfer heat into the fuel cell stack 60, e.g. to heat<br>
internal MEA layers 62. For example, catalyst 192 may comprise platinum and the<br>
heating medium includes the hydrocarbon fuel source 17 supplied to fuel processor<br>
15 (FIG. 1 A). In one embodiment, the fuel source 17 is heated before entering fuel<br>
cell 20 and enters fuel cell 20 as a gas. Similar to the cooling medium described<br>
above, a fan disposed on one of the walls 199 then moves the gaseous heating<br>
medium within housing 197. In a specific embodiment, the hydrocarbon fuel source<br>
17 used to react with catalyst 192 comes from a reformer exhaust in fuel processor<br>
15. This advantageously pre-heats the fuel source 17 before receipt within fuel cell 20<br>
and also uses or burns any fuel remaining in the reformer exhaust after use by fuel<br>
processor 15. Alternatively, fuel cell 20 includes a separate hydrocarbon fuel source<br>
17 feed that directly supplies hydrocarbon fuel source 17 to fuel cell 20 for heating<br>
and reaction with catalyst 192. Other suitable catalysts 192 include palladium, a<br>
platinum/palladium mix, iron, ruthenium, and combinations thereof. Each of these<br>
will react with a hydrocarbon fuel source 17 to generate heat. Other suitable heating<br>
catalysts 192 include platinum on alumina and platinum/ palladium on alumina, for<br>
example.<br>
As shown in FIG. 2A, catalyst 192 is arranged on, and in contact with, each<br>
heat transfer appendage 46b. In this case, the heating medium passes over each<br>
appendage 46 and reacts with catalyst 192. This generates heat, which is absorbed via<br>
conductive thermal communication by the cooler appendage 46. Wash coating may<br>
be employed to dispose catalyst 192 on each appendage 46. A ceramic support may<br>
also be used to bond catalyst 192 on an appendage 46.<br>
FIG. 5A illustrates two examples in which a thermal catalyst 192 is disposed<br>
in proximity to heat transfer appendage 46. Proximity in this case refers to being<br>
arranged relative to heat transfer appendage 46 such that heat generated by catalyst<br>
192 transfers to appendage 46, either by conduction, convection and/or radiation. As<br>
shown in FIG. 5A, fuel cell 20 comprises a bulkhead 195 that contains catalyst 192.<br>
Bulkhead 195 attaches to end plates 64 (e.g., via an adhesive tape such as kapton) and<br>
creates a void for containing catalyst 192 and each appendage 46. Catalyst pellets 192<br>
are then disposed in bulkhead 195. The bulkhead 195 allows the heating medium to<br>
pass over and interact with catalyst 192. FIG. 5B illustrates a side view of gaseous<br>
travel through bulkhead 195. Air and fuel enter a mixing chamber 191 before travel<br>
of the mixed gases across the heat transfer appendages 46. One or more outlet ports<br>
then exhaust the gases after interaction with catalyst 192.<br>
As shown in FIG. 2A, the fuel cell 20 includes a mechanical housing 197 that<br>
encloses and protects stack 60. Walls 199 of housing 197 and appendages 46 combine<br>
to form ducting 193. The inter-appendage ducting 193 permits a) catalyst 192 to be<br>
packed into the ducting 193 and b) permits the heating medium to pass through<br>
ducting 193 and over catalyst 192. In this case, catalyst 192 is packed in ducting 193<br>
with a packing density loose enough to permit a gas to pass therethrough without<br>
encountering excessive resistance. A fan is then used to provide the heating medium<br>
into ducting 193.<br>
For catalyst-based heating, heat then a) transfers from catalyst 192 to<br>
appendage 46, b) moves laterally though bi-polar plate 44 via conductive heat transfer<br>
from lateral portions of the plate that include heat transfer appendage 46 to central<br>
portions of bi-polar plate 44 in contact with the MEA layers 62, and c) conducts from<br>
bi-polar plate 44 to MEA layer 62. When a fuel cell stack 60 includes multiple MEA<br>
layers 62, lateral heating through each bi-polar plate 44 provides interlayer heating of<br>
multiple MEA layers 62 in stack 60, which expedites fuel cell 20 warm up.<br>
Bi-polar plates 44 of FIG. 2A include heat transfer appendages 46 on each<br>
side. In this case, one set of heat transfer appendages 46a is used for cooling while the<br>
other set of heat transfer appendages 46b is used for heating. Although heat transfer<br>
appendages 46 of FIG. 5A are illustrated with two different types of heating via<br>
catalyst 192 (namely, by packing into ducting 193 and storage in bulkheads 195), it is<br>
understood that fuel cell 20 need not include multiple methods of heating appendages<br>
46 and may only include one the aforementioned techniques. In addition, while bi-<br>
polar plates 44 illustrated in FIGs. 2A and 3 A show plates 44 with only one or two<br>
heat transfer appendages 46 disposed on sides of stack 60, appendage 46<br>
arrangements can be varied to affect and improve heat dissipation and thermal<br>
management of fuel cell stack 60 according to other specific designs. For example,<br>
more than two heat transfer appendages 46 may be employed on a single plate 44 to<br>
increase heat transfer between internal and external portions of plate 44. In addition,<br>
appendages 46 need not span a side of plate 44 as shown and may be tailored based<br>
on how the heating fluid is channeled through the housing 197.<br>
7. IMPROVED INTERPLATE SEALING<br>
The present invention also improves sealing of adjacent bi-polar plates 44. As<br>
mentioned above with respect to FIG. 2E, plate 44 includes sealing portion 87 that<br>
borders channel field 72 about the periphery of each plate 44. The sealing portion 87<br>
surrounds channel fields 72 and surrounds manifolds 102-108 about the periphery of<br>
plate 44. The sealing portion 87 seals the MEA layer 62 and manifolds 102-108.<br>
Sealing works well when mating faces to be sealed are substantially flat and<br>
devoid of structures that diverge from a fiat or mating fit. For the bi-polar plate 44 of<br>
FIG. 2E, manifold channels 76e that extend from manifold 102 to buffer 150a prevent<br>
a continuous portion of face 75 a from sealing about manifold 102 and sealing about<br>
channel field 72.<br>
FIG. 7A illustrates a top perspective view of bi-polar plates 44 including<br>
gasket landings 400 on sealing portions 87 of the plate in accordance with one<br>
embodiment of the present invention. FIG. 7B shows a close-up of landing 400a.<br>
Gasket landings 400a-d are each disposed on the top face 75a of plate 44p and<br>
peripherally surround a manifold on face 75a. Similar landings are also found on the<br>
bottom face of plate 44. As the term is used herein, a gasket landing 400 refers to a<br>
portion of a bi-polar plate face 75 having a continuous planar path on the face 75.<br>
Typically, the gasket landing 400 path surrounds a manifold about the entire border of<br>
the manifold, thus allowing a full perimetric seal. For example, gasket landing 400a<br>
fully surrounds the planar perimeter of hydrogen inlet manifold 102 on face 75a of<br>
plate 44p, gasket landing 400b peripherally surrounds cathode exhaust manifold 108<br>
on face 75 a of plate 44p, gasket landing 400c peripherally surrounds anode exhaust<br>
manifold 104, and gasket landing 400d peripherally surrounds inlet oxygen manifold<br>
106.<br>
When bi-polar plates 44p and 44q are stacked adjacent to each other, each<br>
landing 400 provides continuous and uninterrupted planar contact between opposing<br>
faces of plates 44p and 44q. As shown in FIG. 7C, a gasket 406 is disposed between<br>
landings 400 of adjacent plates 44p and 44q. Pressure from bolts 82 and end plates 64<br>
(FIG. 2A) then compresses gasket 406 between plates 44 and between the continuous<br>
landings 400. Gasket 406 may include materials selected from the following high<br>
temperature and chemical resistant materials: silicone, poly (tetrafluro ethylene)<br>
(Teflon PTFE), poly (perfluoroalkoxy) (Teflon PFA), fluorinated ethylene propylene<br>
(FEP), polyvinylidene fluride (PVDF), polysiloxane (silicone rubber/sealant),<br>
polyimide (Kapton), polyamide (nylon), polyester (Mylar), Epoxy, polyphenylene<br>
oxide (PPO), sulfonated polyphenylene oxide, polystyrene oxide, polymethacrylate,<br>
polyether ether ketone (PEEK), and copolymer and mixture thereof. Gasket 406 may<br>
be screen printed to fit the non-symmetrical dimensions of landing 400. The gasket<br>
materials may also be applied by die cutting gasket films, direct screen printing,<br>
spraying, casting or overmolding of high performance gasket solutions.<br>
As mentioned above, substrate 89 may also be raised at sealing portion 87<br>
relative to substrate 89 in the central portion of plate 44 and no gasket is employed<br>
between the plates 44. In this case, landings 400 of adjacent plates 44 act as the seal<br>
when pressed together by bolts 82 and end plates 64 and no gasket is needed.<br>
To create landings 400, each plate 44 includes manifold channels 402 that a)<br>
open to a manifold, b) traverse the bi-polar plate 44 substrate from the top face 75a to<br>
the bottom face 75b, and c) are configured to communicate gas between a manifold<br>
and a channel field. FIG. 7D illustrates a side cross section of bi-polar plates 44p and<br>
44q taken through manifold channel 402a of plate 44p. FIG. 7E illustrates a side cross<br>
section of bi-polar plates 44p and 44q taken through manifold channel 402d of plate<br>
44q. As shown, manifold channel 402a opens into manifold 104 at the top face 75a,<br>
turns 90 degrees down and extends from the top face 75a to the bottom face 75b, and<br>
progresses along the bottom face to open to a flow buffer 150 or channel of a channel<br>
field on the bottom face 75b. Similarly, manifold channel 402d opens into manifold<br>
104 at the top face 75a for plate 44q, turns 90 degrees down and extends from the top<br>
face 75a to the bottom face 75b, and progresses along the bottom face 75b of plate<br>
44q to open to a channel 76 of a channel field on the bottom face 75b. Thus, each<br>
manifold channel 402 starts gaseous communication on one face and routes the gas to<br>
a second face of plate 44. While the manifolds 402 shown in FIGs. 7E and 7F include<br>
orthogonal dimensions between faces 75, other arrangements are anticipated such as<br>
rounded corners or non-ninety degree turns.<br>
By routing channel 402 through the plate, planar space is created between a<br>
manifold and channel field on both faces 75 of plate 44. The planar space permits<br>
continuous surface for landings 400 about each manifold. Gasket landing 400 thus<br>
avoids intersection with the manifold channel 402 on each face 75. Conversely,<br>
manifold channel 402 avoids intersection with gaskets landing 400 on both faces of<br>
the plate 44 on which it is formed.<br>
As shown, each manifold communicates gases to three manifold channels 402.<br>
Channels 402 are laterally staggered between adjacent plates 44p and 44q to prevent<br>
channels 402 on adjacent plates from overlapping when plates 44p and 44q are<br>
arranged adjacent to each other in the stack 60. FIG. 7C illustrates a front cross<br>
section of bi-polar plates 44p and 44q and shows the staggering of manifold channels<br>
402a-f on plates 44p and 44q about manifold 104.<br>
8. PRE-BENT END PLATES<br>
Referring back to FIG. 2A, MEA layers 62 require pressure for operation.<br>
Stack 60 achieves this pressure by compressing top and bottom end plates 64a and<br>
64b via bolts 82a and 82b. Tightening bolts 82a and 82b increases the pressure<br>
provided by end plates 64 on the planar area of each MEA layer 62. Bolts 82 thus<br>
hold stack 60 under compression via end plates 64. Using flat end plates 64 often<br>
results in unequal pressure distribution to each MEA layer 62 in fuel cell stack 60.<br>
More specifically, pressure in stack 60 about or near where bolts 82 apply local<br>
pressure is often greater than in central planar portions of the stack. This pressure<br>
variance affects performance of fuel cell 20. To reduce pressure variance in stack 60,<br>
FIG. 6 illustrates pre-bent end plates 64a and 64b suitable for use in fuel cell 20 in<br>
accordance with one embodiment of the present invention.<br>
One of the top and bottom end plates 64a and 64b is configured with a shape<br>
before assembly in fuel cell 20 that increases pressure applied to a central planar<br>
portion of MEA 62 when the top end plate 64a and bottom end plate 64b are secured<br>
together. 'Pre-bent' end plates, as the term is used herein, refers to end plates 64 that<br>
are configured with a shape before assembly that substantially flattens when top end<br>
plate 64a and bottom end plate 64b are secured together in fuel cell stack 60. The pre-<br>
bent end plates 64 are configured and curved before assembly in fuel cell stack 60<br>
such that assembly in stack 60 causes pressure applied by assembly of end plates 64<br>
to increase in a central planar region of stack 60 between bolts 82 relative to planar<br>
portions of MEA 62 closer to bolts 82. This reduces planar pressure variance<br>
throughout an MEA 62 in the stack 60.<br>
As shown, pre-bent end plates 64a and 64b include a convex curvature before<br>
assembly that reduces when the top end plate and bottom end plate 64 are secured<br>
together. For the one-dimensional convex curve shown in FIG. 6, bolts 82 pass<br>
through holes in an opposite sides of each plate 64. The curvature converts local<br>
pressure in each end of pre-bent end plates 64 via tightening of bolts 82 to central<br>
planar pressure. Initially, the shape of pre-bent end plates 64 causes increased<br>
pressure in the central planar portions of each MEA 62 in the stack 60. As bolts 82<br>
tighten, the convex curvature of plates 64 reduces. In addition, the convex curvature<br>
converts proportionately less local forces from each bolt 82 to central planar<br>
compression of membrane electrode assembly layers 62. When fully bolts 82 are fully<br>
tightened, pressure in the central planar portions of each MEA 62 balances the<br>
pressure in portions of each MEA 62 proximate to the planar position of bolts 82.<br>
This reduces planar pressure variance in MEA layers 62 and stack 60.<br>
Assembling pre-bent end plates 64 in fuel cell stack 60 results in a stack 60<br>
such as that shown in FIG. 2A, with the exception of reduced planar pressure variance<br>
in MEA layers 62. Pre-bent end plates 64 thus hold the bi-polar plates 44 and MEA<br>
layers 62 together, and apply pressure across the planar area of each bi-polar plate 44<br>
and each MEA 62 with a reduced pressure variance.<br>
One or both end plates 64a and 64b can be pre-bent or otherwise configured<br>
before assembly. For curved plates, the amount of curvature in each end plate 64 is<br>
configured to minimize the planar pressure variance in MEA layers 62 of fuel cell<br>
stack 60. The thickness of end plate 64, end plate 64 material, and the desired<br>
pressure to be applied onto stack 60 affect the amount of curvature in each end plate<br>
64. In one embodiment, end plate has a thickness from to about 1/2 mm to about 3mm.<br>
End plates 64 may comprise a suitably rigid material such as stainless steel, titanium,<br>
aluminum, a composite, or ceramic, for example. In one embodiment, each MEA 62<br>
employs an operating pressure from about 30 psi to about 400 psi. An operating<br>
pressure of about 100 psi is also suitable for some stack 60 designs.<br>
9. CONCLUSION<br>
While this invention has been described in terms of several preferred<br>
embodiments, there are alterations, permutations, and equivalents that fall within the<br>
scope of this invention which have been omitted for brevity's sake. For example,<br>
although the present invention has been described in terms of pre-bent end plates 64,<br>
not all embodiments of the present invention need include pre-bent end plates 64 and<br>
may employ traditional flat end plates. In addition, although the present invention has<br>
been described in terms of one or more flow buffers used to equalize gaseous<br>
distribution, bi-polar plates 44 including heat transfer appendages need not include<br>
flow buffers. It is therefore intended that the scope of the invention should be<br>
