				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The invention concerns coated sodium percarbonate granules<br>
with improved storage stability and a process for the<br>
production of these sodium percarbonate granules.<br>
Sodium percarbonate is used as a bleaching agent and as an<br>
active bleaching component in detergents and cleaning<br>
agents. The disadvantage of sodium percarbonate here is<br>
that it tends to decompose in contact with moisture and<br>
with components of the detergent and cleaning agent<br>
compositions, leading to a loss in active oxygen and hence<br>
in bleaching action. In these applications sodium<br>
percarbonate is therefore preferably used in the form of<br>
granules coated with a stabilising coating layer in order<br>
to achieve improved storage stability in detergents and<br>
cleaning agents.<br>
It is known from EP-A 0 863 842 that sodium percarbonate<br>
granules with improved storage stability can be produced by<br>
applying a firmly adhering coating layer, consisting<br>
substantially of sodium sulfate, to a core of sodium<br>
percarbonate produced by fluidised bed spray granulation.<br>
WO 96/06801 describes coated sodium percarbonate granules<br>
having improved stability that are synthesised from a core<br>
of sodium percarbonate granules, an inner coating layer<br>
containing a sulfate or silicate and an outer coating layer<br>
containing a compound (B) selected from salts of<br>
monocarboxylic and dicarboxylic acids having 4 or more<br>
carbon atoms and a compound (C) selected from salts of<br>
sulfated oils, α-olefin sulfonic acids and monoalkyl and<br>
dialkyl sulfosuccinates. The examples given in the<br>
specification show that the presence of compounds (B) is<br>
necessary to achieve an adequate storage stability and that<br><br>
granules containing only compound (C) and no compound (B)<br>
in the outer layer display unsatisfactory storage<br>
stability.<br>
CP-A 06-263434 describes stable in storage sodium<br>
percarbonate granules that are synthesised from surfactant-<br>
containing sodium percarbonate granules as the core, an<br>
irner coating layer consisting of a sulfate and an outer<br>
coating layer consisting of an anionic surfactant. Here the<br>
core material is produced by crystallisation and subsequent<br>
granulation with addition of the surfactant. From the<br>
examples and comparative examples given in the<br>
specification it follows that the core material must be<br>
produced with addition of a surfactant in order for the<br>
coated sodium percarbonate obtained to display an adequate<br>
storage stability and that granules with a surfactant-free<br>
sodium percarbonate core, an inner coating layer consisting<br>
of a sulfate and an outer coating layer consisting of an<br>
amonic surfactant display insufficient storage stability.<br>
In the case of the sodium percarbonate granules described<br>
in EP-A 0 863 842 there is still a need for an improvement<br>
in storage stability. The sodium percarbonate granules<br>
described in WO 96/06801 have the disadvantage that they<br>
are complicated to produce, since at least three different<br>
compounds are necessary for coating the sodium percarbonate<br>
granules.<br>
The sodium percarbonate granules described in<br>
JP-A 06-2 53434 have the disadvantage that with the<br>
surfactant they contain an organic compound in the sodium<br>
percarbonate core. This has a disadvantageous effect on the<br>
internal stability of the sodium percarbonate granules and<br>
leads to restrictions in the storage of large amounts of<br>
the granules in silos. For storage in silos the sodium<br>
percarbonate granules must display high internal stability,<br>
in other words low heat release during storage, since<br><br>
otherwise decomposition of the sodium percarbonate granules<br>
can occur in the silo due to self-accelerating heating.<br>
The object of the invention was therefore to provide coated<br>
sodium percarbonate granules having improved storage<br>
stability, which can be produced by simple means and which<br>
combine the properties of high storage stability in<br>
detergent, and cleaning agent compositions and high internal<br>
stability for storage in silos.<br>
Surprisingly it was found that this object can be achieved<br>
by coated sodium percarbonate granules comprising<br>
a)	a core produced by fluidised bed spray granulation,<br>
containing sodium percarbonate as its main component,<br>
b)	an inner coating layer containing an inorganic,<br>
hydrate-forming salt as its main component and<br>
c)	an outer coating layer containing as its main<br>
component at least one surfactant containing in the<br>
molecule one or more sulfate or sulfonate groups in<br>
the form of an alkali metal, alkaline-earth metal or<br>
ammonium salt.<br>
The invention also includes a process for the production of<br>
coated sodium percarbonate granules with improved storage<br>
stability, comprising the following steps:<br>
a)	production of a core material by fluidised bed spray<br>
granulation, wherein an aqueous hydrogen peroxide<br>
solution and an aqueous soda solution are sprayed into a<br>
fruidised bed comprising sodium percarbonate particles,<br>
b)	 application of an inner coating layer onto the core<br>
material from step a) by spraying an aqueous solution in<br>
which at least one hydrate-forming inorganic salt is<br>
dissolved and<br><br>
c) application of an outer coating layer onto the coated<br>
material from step b) by spraying an aqueous mixture in<br>
which at least one surfactant is dissolved or<br>
emulsified, which contains in the molecule one or more<br>
sulfate or sulfonate groups in the form of an alkali<br>
metal, alkaline-earth metal or ammonium salt.<br>
The invention furthermore relates to the use of the sodium<br>
percarbonate granules according to the invention as<br>
bleaching agents or as active bleaching components in<br>
detergent and cleaning agents, and to bleaching agents and<br>
detergents and cleaning agents containing the sodium<br>
percarbonate granules according to the invention.<br>
The sodium percarbonate granules according to the invention<br>
comprise a core produced by fluidised bed spray<br>
granulation, containing sodium percarbonate as its main<br>
component. Production of the core material takes place by<br>
known means by fluidised bed spray granulation, wherein an<br>
aqueous hydrogen peroxide solution and an aqueous sodium<br>
carbonate solution are sprayed into a fluidised bed<br>
containing nuclei whose dimensions are smaller than the<br>
particles of the core material to be produced and wherein<br>
water is evaporated at the same time. Sodium percarbonate<br>
is preferably used as the nucleus material. The core<br>
material is preferably produced by the method described in<br>
EP-A 0 716 640.<br>
The proportion of core material in the coated sodium<br>
percarbonate granules according to the invention is<br>
preferably in the range from 80 to 99.5 wt.%, particularly<br>
preferably in the range from 90 to 99 wt.% and in<br>
particular in the range from 92 to 98 wt.%. The proportion<br>
of sodium percarbonate in the core of the sodium<br>
percarbonate granules according to the invention is<br>
preferably more than 80 wt.%, particularly preferably more<br>
than 95 wt.% and in particular more than 98 wt.%. The<br>
proportion of organic carbon compounds in the core is<br><br>
preferably less than 1 wt.%, particularly preferably less<br>
than 0.1 wt.% and in particular less than 0.01 wt.%.<br>
In a preferred embodiment the core contains small amounts<br>
of additives, which have a stabilising effect on the active<br>
oxygen content, the proportion of stabilising additives in<br>
the core being preferably less than 2 wt.%. Magnesium<br>
salts, welter glass, stannates, pyrophosphates,<br>
polyphosphates and chelating agents from the series<br>
comprising hydroxycarboxylic acids, aminocarboxylic acids,<br>
aminophosphonic acids, phosphonocarboxylic acids and<br>
hydroxyphosphonic acids, as well as alkali metal, ammonium<br>
or magnesium salts thereof, are preferably used as<br>
stability-increasing additives. In a particularly preferred<br>
embodiment the core contains as stabilising additive an<br>
alkali metal silicate, preferably water glass, having a<br>
SiO2/Na2O modulus in the range from 1 to 3, in a quantity<br>
from 0.1 to 1 wt.%. In the most preferred embodiment the<br>
core also contains in addition to this amount of alkali<br>
metal silicate a magnesium compound in a quantity of 50 to<br>
2000 ppm Mg2+.<br>
The coated sodium percarbonate granules according to the<br>
invention also include in addition to the core of sodium<br>
percarbonate an inner coating layer containing an<br>
inorganic, hydrate-forming salt as its main component and<br>
an outer coating layer containing as its main component at<br>
least one surfactant displaying in the molecule one or more<br>
sulfate or sulfonate groups in the form of an alkali metal,<br>
alkaline-earth metal or ammonium salt. In addition to this<br>
inner and outer coating layer, the sodium percarbonate<br>
granules according to the invention can also contain one or<br>
more additional coating layers, these being able to be<br>
positioned both between the core and the inner coating<br>
layer and between the inner and the outer coating layer and<br>
outside the outer coating layer.<br><br>
3etween the coating layers and between the innermost<br>
coating layer and the core there can be a clear boundary,<br>
at which the composition changes abruptly. Generally,<br>
however, a transition zone will form between the individual<br>
coating layers and between the innermost coating layer and<br>
the core, which contains the components from both adjoining<br>
layers. Such transition zones are formed for example by the<br>
application of a coating layer in the form of an aqueous<br>
solution, whereby as the layer starts to form, part of the<br>
layer beneath it is partially dissolved, such that a<br>
transition zone forms that contains the components of both<br>
layers. In this way, between the core and the inner coating<br>
layer a transition layer can form which contains sodium<br>
percarbonate, sodium carbonate, sodium hydrogen carbonate<br>
and the inorganic hydrate-forming salt from the inner<br>
coating layer. Similarly, between the inner coating layer<br>
and the outer coating layer a transition layer can form<br>
which contains the inorganic hydrate-forming salt from the<br>
inner coating layer and the surfactant from the outer<br>
coating layer.<br>
The inner coating layer and outer coating layer are<br>
preferably formed in such a way that they cover the<br>
underlying material by more than 95 %, preferably more than<br>
98 % and in particular completely.<br>
The inner coating layer of the coated sodium percarbonate<br>
granules according to the invention contains an inorganic,<br>
hydrate-forming salt as its main component. The proportion<br>
of inner coating layer in the coated sodium percarbonate<br>
granules according to the invention is preferably in the<br>
range from 1 to 10 wt.%, particularly preferably in the<br>
range from 2 to 7 wt.%. The proportion of inorganic,<br>
hydrate-forming salt in the material of the inner coating<br>
layer is preferably at least 50 wt.%, particularly<br>
preferably at least 90 wt.%. The inorganic, hydrate-forming<br>
salt of the inner coating layer is preferably chosen from<br><br>
the series comprising sodium sulfate, sodium carbonate,<br>
sodium hydrogen carbonate or magnesium sulfate. Mixtures<br>
and mixed salts of these compounds are also suitable. The<br>
inner coating layer particularly preferably contains sodium<br>
sulfate as the inorganic hydrate-forming salt.<br>
The outer coating layer of the coated sodium percarbonate<br>
granules according to the invention contains as its main<br>
component at least one surfactant containing in the<br>
molecule one or more sulfate or sulfonate groups in the<br>
from of an alkali metal, alkaline-earth metal or ammonium<br>
Salt. The proportion of outer coating layer in the coated<br>
sodium percarbonate granules according to the invention is<br>
preferably in the range from 0.1 to 10 wt.%, particularly<br>
preferably 0.5 to 5 wt.% and in particular 1 to 3 wt.%. The<br>
proportion of surfactant in the material of the outer<br>
coating layer is preferably at least 50 wt.% and<br>
particularly preferably at least 80 wt.%. In a preferred<br>
embodiment the outer coating layer contains a mixture of<br>
surfactants, the surfactant mixture consisting of more than<br>
50 wt.% of surfactants that contain in the molecule one or<br>
more sulfate or sulfonate groups in the form of an alkali<br>
metal, alkaline-earth metal or ammonium salt. The sulfate<br>
or sulfonate groups in the surfactant in the outer coating<br>
layer are particularly preferably in the form of an alkali<br>
metal salt, most preferably in the form of the sodium salt.<br>
In the outer coating layer alkyl benzene sulfonates, alkane<br>
sulfonates, α-olefin sulfonates, α-sulfo fatty acid esters<br>
or sulfosuccinates are preferably used as surfactants<br>
having sulfonate groups. As alkyl benzene sulfonates,<br>
preferably those a straight-chain or branched alkyl group<br>
with preferably 8 to 20 carbon atoms, particularly 10 to 16<br>
carbon atoms, are used. Preferred alkane sulfonates are<br>
examples having straight-chain alkyl chains with 12 to 18<br>
carbon atoms. As a-olefin sulfonates, the reaction<br>
products from the sulfonation of α-olefins having 12 to 18<br><br>
carbon atoms are preferably used. As α-sulfo fatty acid<br>
esters, sulfonation products of fatty acid esters produced<br>
from fatty acids having 12 to 18 carbon atoms and short-<br>
chain alcohols having 1 to 3 carbon atoms are preferred.<br>
Alkyl sulfates and ether sulfates are preferably used as<br>
surfactants having a sulfate group in the molecule.<br>
Preferred alkyl sulfates are examples having straight-chain<br>
alkyl radicals with 12 to 18 carbon atoms. Preferred ether<br>
sulfates are the alkyl ether sulfates obtained by<br>
ethoxylation of linear alcohols having 12 to 18 carbon<br>
atoms with 2 to 6 ethylene oxide units, followed by<br>
sulfation.<br>
In addition to the surfactants having sulfate or sulfonate<br>
groups, the outer coating layer can also contain other<br>
anionic surfactants as well as non-ionic surfactants,<br>
cationic surfactants and amphoteric surfactants.<br>
In a further embodiment of the invention, corresponding to<br>
DI3 102 61 161, the coated sodium percarbonate granules<br>
display an additional coating layer on top of the inner<br>
coating layer which contains as its main component an<br>
alkali metal silicate having a modulus of SiO2 to alkali<br>
metal oxide of over 2.5. The additional coating layer can<br>
either be between the inner and the outer coating layer or<br>
be positioned on top of the outer coating layer. The<br>
proportion of additional coating layer in the coated sodium<br>
percarbonate granules according to the invention is<br>
preferably in the range from 0.2 to 3 wt.%. The proportion<br>
of alkali metal silicate in the material of the additional<br>
coating layer is preferably more than 50 wt.% and<br>
particularly preferably more than 80 wt.%. Sodium water<br>
glass is preferably used as the alkali metal silicate in<br>
the additional coating layer.<br><br>
The sodium percarbonate granules according to the invention<br>
preferably display an average particle diameter in the<br>
range from 0.3 to 2 mm, particularly preferably in the<br>
range from 0.5 to 1 mm. The sodium percarbonate granules<br>
according to the invention preferably contain only a small<br>
proportion of fine particles. More than 90 % of the<br>
particles in the sodium percarbonate according to the<br>
invention preferably display a diameter of over 0.2 mm.<br>
The invention also concerns a process for the production of<br>
coated sodium percarbonate granules with improved storage<br>
stability, which comprises the following steps:<br>
a)	production of a core material by fluidised bed spray<br>
granulation, wherein an aqueous hydrogen peroxide<br>
solution and an aqueous soda solution are sprayed into a<br>
fluidised bed comprising sodium percarbonate particles,<br>
b)	application of an inner coating layer onto the core<br>
material from step a) by spraying an aqueous solution,<br>
in which at least one hydrate-forming, inorganic salt is<br>
dissolved and<br>
c)	application of an outer coating layer onto the coated<br>
material from step b) by spraying an aqueous mixture in<br>
which at least one surfactant is dissolved or<br>
emulsified, which contains in the molecule one or more<br>
sulfate or sulfonate groups in the form of an alkali<br>
metal, alkaline-earth metal or ammonium salt.<br>
Production of the core material from hydrogen peroxide and<br>
soda takes place by known means by the fluidised bed spray<br>
granulation method and preferably by the method described<br>
in EP-A 0 716 640. Here hydrogen peroxide and sodium<br>
carbonate solution are preferably reacted in a molar ratio<br>
of H2O2 to Na2CO3 of 1.4 to 1.7, particularly preferably 1.5<br>
to 1.65. Hydrogen peroxide is used as an aqueous solution<br>
with preferably 3 0 to 75 wt.% H2O2, particularly preferably<br><br>
4( to 70 wt.% H2O2. The hydrogen peroxide solution can<br>
additionally contain stabilising additives, such as e.g.<br>
complexing agents or magnesium compounds. Sodium carbonate<br>
is preferably used as an aqueous solution with a<br>
concentration of between 10 wt.% sodium carbonate and the<br>
saturation concentration of sodium carbonate, particularly<br>
preferably between 20 wt.% sodium carbonate and the<br>
saturation concentration of sodium carbonate. The sodium<br>
carbonate solution can likewise contain stabilising<br>
additives, such as e.g. water glass. In the fluidised bed<br>
spray granulation process the water introduced with the<br>
feed materials is evaporated and removed by feeding a<br>
drying gas into the fluidised bed. Air or a combustion gas<br>
obtained by burning a fuel such as e.g. natural gas with<br>
air is preferably used as the drying gas. The drying gas is<br>
preferably supplied to the fluidised bed at a temperature<br>
of between 120 and 400 °C, particularly preferably between<br>
200 and 400 °C. The temperature in the fluidised bed is<br>
preferably kept at between 40 and 95 °C, particularly<br>
between 40 and 80 °C and in particular between 50 and<br>
70 3C.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, nucleus material is supplied to<br>
the fluidised bed in a quantity that leads to the formation<br>
of granules having an average particle size in the range<br>
from 0.2 to 2 mm. The core material is preferably<br>
discharged from the fluidised bed by a classifying process,<br>
and particularly preferably by the process described in EP-<br>
A 0 938 922, such that preferably more than 90 wt.% of the<br>
core material particles discharged from the fluidised bed<br>
display a diameter of over 0.2 mm.<br>
The inner coating layer is applied by spraying an aqueous<br>
solution in which at least one hydrate-forming, inorganic<br>
salt is dissolved. The inner coating layer is preferably<br>
applied by spraying an aqueous sodium sulfate solution. The<br>
bulk of the water contained within the aqueous solution is<br><br>
preferably evaporated by the input of heat as it is being<br>
sprayed, such that during the application of the inner<br>
coating layer only a small part of the core material begins<br>
to dissolve again and a solid coating layer is already<br>
formed from the hydrate-forming, inorganic salt during the<br>
spraying process. The inner coating layer is preferably<br>
applied by spraying the aqueous solution of the hydrate-<br>
forming, inorganic salt in a fluidised bed and particularly<br>
preferably by the process described in EP-A 0 97 0 917, with<br>
which a dense coating layer can be achieved even with small<br>
amounts of coating layer material. Application of the<br>
inner coating layer in a fluidised bed preferably takes<br>
place with the supply of a drying gas to the fluidised bed,<br>
such that, a temperature in the range from 3 0 to 90 °C is<br>
established in the fluidised bed.<br>
Application of the outer coating layer by the process<br>
according to the invention is performed by spraying an<br>
aqueous mixture containing at least one surfactant which<br>
contains in the molecule one or more sulfate or sulfonate<br>
groups in the form of an alkali metal, alkaline-earth or<br>
ammonium salt, onto the granules coated with an inner<br>
coating layer. The aforementioned alkyl benzene sulfonates,<br>
alkyl sulfonates, α-olefin sulfonates, sulfosuccinates,<br>
alkyl sulfates and ether sulfates are preferably used as<br>
surfactants, either alone or in blends. The surfactants or<br>
surfactant blends can be sprayed both as aqueous solutions<br>
and as aqueous emulsions. Solid surfactants that are poorly<br>
solable in water can be converted into sprayable aqueous<br>
emulsions by heating them above their melting point, by<br>
adding an auxiliary surfactant, or by a combination of<br>
these two measures, in the presence of water. During the<br>
application of the outer coating layer, the bulk of the<br>
water contained within the aqueous surfactant blend is<br>
preferably evaporated by the input of heat as the aqueous<br>
blend is being sprayed, such that during the application of<br>
the outer coating layer only a small part of the inner<br><br>
coating layer begins to dissolve again and a solid or waxy,<br>
surfactant-containing outer coating layer is formed as the<br>
outer coating layer is applied. The outer coating layer is<br>
preferably applied by spraying the aqueous surfactant blend<br>
in a fluidised bed in which the material coated with the<br>
inner coating layer has been placed. The outer coating<br>
layer is particularly preferably applied by the process<br>
described in EP-A 0 970 917, with which dense outer coating<br>
layers can be achieved even with small amounts of<br>
surfactant. During application of the outer coating layer<br>
by spraying the aqueous surfactant blend in a fluidised<br>
bed, a drying gas is preferably supplied to the fluidised<br>
bed such that a temperature in the range from 3 0 to 90 °C<br>
is established in the fluidised bed.<br>
In a preferred embodiment corresponding to WO 02/051745,<br>
the process according to the invention for producing coated<br>
sodium percarbonate granules includes an additional step of<br>
thermal aftertreatment at a temperature of 7 0 to 12 0 °C,<br>
preferably 80 to 95 °C, for a period of at least 2 minutes,<br>
preferably 5 to 60 minutes, which is performed after step<br>
a), production of the core material by fluidised bed spray<br>
granulation. The thermal aftertreatment is preferably<br>
performed after step b), application of an inner coating<br>
layer, and particularly preferably after step c) ,<br>
application of the outer coating layer.<br>
The invention also additionally provides the use of the<br>
coated sodium percarbonate granules according to the<br>
invention, or of the coated sodium percarbonate granules<br>
produced by the process according to the invention, as<br>
bleaching agents and as active bleaching components in<br>
detergents and cleaning agents.<br>
The invention also provides bleaching agents having<br>
in/proved storage stability, which contain 15 to 99 wt. % of<br>
the coated sodium percarbonate granules according to the<br><br>
invention or of the sodium percarbonate granules produced<br>
by the process according to the invention.<br>
The invention likewise provides detergents and cleaning<br>
agents having improved storage stability, which contain 1<br>
to 40 wt.% of the coated sodium percarbonate granules<br>
according to the invention or of the coated sodium<br>
percarbonate granules produced by the process according to<br>
the invention.<br>
The coated sodium percarbonate granules according to the<br>
invention and the coated sodium percarbonate granules<br>
produced by the process according to the invention display<br>
improved storage stability in detergents and cleaning<br>
agents. In commercial, zeolite-containing detergent blends,<br>
which are stored in commercial detergent packs, the coated<br>
sodium percarbonate granules according to the invention<br>
display an active oxygen loss of less than 20 % when stored<br>
at 35 °C and 80 % relative humidity for a period of 8<br>
weeks, in other words the residual active oxygen after<br>
storage for eight weeks is over 80 % of the original amount<br>
of active oxygen.<br>
The coated sodium percarbonate granules according to the<br>
invention and the coated sodium percarbonate granules<br>
produced by the process according to the invention also<br>
display a high internal stability, i.e. when stored in bulk<br>
they display only a low release of heat through<br>
decomposition reaction. After storage for 48 hours at 40 °C<br>
the amount of heat released by the coated sodium<br>
percarbonate granules according to the invention, measured<br>
by the TAM method, is less than 5 μW/g and preferably less<br>
than 3 μM/g. Determination of the heat release by the TAM<br>
method is performed by microcalorimetry using a thermal<br>
activity monitor supplied by Thermometric AB, Järfälla (SE)<br>
over a 48 hour storage period in a measuring cell at 40° C.<br><br>
high storage stability combined with high internal<br>
stability can be achieved in the coated sodium percarbonate<br>
granules according to the invention even with small<br>
quantities of coating agents and additives. The coated<br>
sodium percarbonate granules according to the invention<br>
thus display a high content of sodium percarbonate and as a<br>
consequence a high active oxygen content. The active oxygen<br>
content, determined by redox titration of the hydrogen<br>
peroxide released after dissolving the granules in water,<br>
is preferably more than 13.0 wt. % and is particularly<br>
preferably at least 13.5 wt.%.<br>
Coated sodium percarbonate granules according to the<br>
invention displaying no other coating layers in addition to<br>
the inner and outer coating layer, exhibit short dissolving<br>
tames when the granules are dissolved in water. For these<br>
sodium percarbonate granules coated according to the<br>
invention the times to dissolve 95 % of the granules in<br>
water at 15 °C, determined by conductometry, are less than<br>
50 % longer than the times to dissolve non-coated sodium<br>
percarbonate core materials.<br>
By contrast, coated sodium percarbonate granules according<br>
to the invention displaying an additional coating layer<br>
which contains as its main component an alkali metal<br>
silicate having a modulus of over 2.5, exhibit a delayed<br>
dissolution in water, with dissolving times of preferably<br>
more than 5 minutes, particularly preferably more than 10<br>
minutes. The granules having delayed dissolution display<br>
advantages when used in detergents and cleaning agents<br>
containing oxidation-sensitive enzymes. Through the delayed<br>
dissolution of the granules, the enzymes can act over a<br>
longer period of time before they are deactivated by the<br>
released active oxygen use.<br><br>
Examples<br>
a) Determining the dissolving time:<br>
2 g of non-coated or coated sodium percarbonate are<br>
stirred into 1 1 water at 15 °C. The dissolving time<br>
is defined as the time at which 95 % is dissolved;<br>
this is determined by conductometry.<br>
To compare the dissolving time of two differently<br>
produced/coated products, they must display a<br>
comparable grain size; if necessary, narrow screen<br>
fractions are compared with one another.<br>
b) Determining the storage stability in detergent blends:<br>
A phosphate-free but zeolite-containing detergent<br>
powder, TAED activator and the coated sodium<br>
percarbonate are mixed together in a quantity such<br>
that the mixture contains 5 % TAED and the active<br>
oxygen content is around 2.35 wt.%.<br>
Components of the detergent powder in wt.%:<br>
Anionic surfactants	12<br>
Nor-ionic surfactants 8<br>
Zeolite A	3 6<br>
Soda	10<br>
Sodium silicates	3<br>
Remainder including moisture	31<br>
800 g of each mixture are stored in commercial El<br>
detergent packs, impregnated to be water-repellent and<br>
sealed, in a conditioning cabinet at 35 °C and 80 %<br>
relative humidity. The active oxygen content is<br>
determined in the conventional way by permanganometry.<br>
The retained active oxygen content is determined as a<br>
percentage from the initial active oxygen content and<br>
the active oxygen content after 8 weeks.<br><br>
Comparative example<br>
Using the process described in EP-B 0 716 640, sodium<br>
percarbonate granules, having an average particle diameter<br>
of 0.75 mm and a proportion of fines under 0.2 mm of less<br>
than 2 %, were produced from an aqueous hydrogen peroxide<br>
solution and an aqueous soda solution by fluidised bed<br>
spray granulation at a fluidised bed temperature of 50 to<br>
70 °C.<br>
The granules were coated with a sodium sulfate layer by the<br>
process described in EP-B 0 863 842 in section [0021] by<br>
spraying a 20 wt.% sodium sulfate solution in a fluidised<br>
bed at a fluidised bed temperature of 50 to 70 °C. The<br>
amount of sodium sulfate solution was chosen such that<br>
6 wt.% sodium sulfate, relative to the amount of granules<br>
used, was applied.<br>
The sodium percarbonate granules coated with sodium sulfate<br>
displayed an active oxygen content of 13.7 wt.%. In the TAM<br>
measurement the granules displayed a release of heat of<br>
2.2 μW/g after 48 hours at 40 °C. The dissolving time of<br>
the granules at 15 °C in water was determined as 1.5<br>
minutes.<br>
After storage in a detergent blend for eight weeks at 3 5 °C<br>
and 80 % relative humidity the residual content of active<br>
oxygen was 67 % of the original amount.<br>
Example:<br>
1000 g of the sodium sulfate-coated sodium percarbonate<br>
granales produced in the comparative example were placed in<br>
a Strea-1 laboratory coater supplied by Aeromatic and held<br>
in a fluidised bed with fluidising air at 70 °C. A 2 wt.%<br>
aqueous solution of sodium dodecyl benzene sulfonate<br>
(Lutensit A-LBN from BASF) was sprayed through a two-<br><br>
component nozzle into the fluidised bed. The amount of<br>
surfactant solution was chosen such that 2 wt.% surfactant,<br>
relative to the amount of granules used, was applied.<br>
Following spraying of the surfactant solution, the granules<br>
were dried in the fluidised bed for a further 3 0 minutes at<br>
70 °C.<br>
The sodium percarbonate granules coated according to the<br>
invention that were obtained had an active oxygen content<br>
of 13.6 wt.%. In the TAM measurement the granules displayed<br>
a release of heat of 2.1 /μW/g after 48 hours at 40 °C. The<br>
dissolving time of the granules at 15 °C in water was<br>
determined as 1.5 minutes.<br>
After storage in a detergent blend for eight weeks at 35 °C<br>
and 80 % relative humidity, the residual content of active<br>
oxygen was 88 % of the original amount.<br><br>
