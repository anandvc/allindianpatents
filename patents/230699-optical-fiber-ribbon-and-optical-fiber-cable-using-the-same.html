DESCRIPTION<br>
OPTICAL FIBER RIBBON AND OPTICAL FIBER CABLE USING THE SAME<br>
.Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to an optical fiber ribbon and an optical fiber cable using the same.<br>
Background Art<br>
As an optical fiber ribbon which is formed by integrating a plurality of optical fibers in a ribbon shape, followings can be named for example.<br>
In Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication Sho. 61(1986)-73112, a ribbon-type optical unit 1105 is disclosed, wherein, as shown in Fig. 39, the ribbon-type optical unit 1105 is configured such that a plurality of coated optical fibers 1103 each of which includes a coating layer 1102 made of an ultraviolet ray curable resin around an optical fiber 1101 are arranged in parallel to form an optical fiber assembled body, and a protective layer 1104 made of an ultraviolet ray curable resin is integrally formed on the optical fiber assembled body in a state that the protective layer 1104 is not adhered to the coating layers 1102. This ribbon type optical unit 1105 is characterized in that assuming an outer diameter of the coated optical fiber 1103 as X, the number of the coated optical fibers 1103 which form the optical fiber<br><br>
assembled body as n, a thickness and a widtn 01 me riojjun-LyL^ optical unit 105 as K and L, relationships 1.1 

In  Japanese  Unexamined  Utility Model  Publication<br>
Hei.4 (1992)-75304, as shown in Fig. 40A and Fig. 40B, in an optical<br>
fiber ribbon, a color layer is formed on an outermost periphery<br>
of each coated optical fiber and an overall coating layer is formed<br>
over the whole periphery of the coated optical fibers. The coated<br>
optical fiber 1201 includes an optical fiber 1202 at the center<br>
thereof and a first coating layer 1203 and a second coating layer<br>
1204	made of an ultraviolet ray curing type resin are sequentially<br>
applied on a periphery of thereof and, further, a color layer<br>
1205	is formed on a periphery the second coating layer 1204 by<br>
applying color ink made of an ultraviolet ray curable resin. A<br>
plurality, (usually 4n (n being 2, 3, ...) pieces, and 8 pieces<br>
in this embodiment) of optical fibers 1202 are arranged in a row<br>
in parallel. The overall coating layer 1206 is filled in gaps<br>
defined between respective coated optical fibers 1201 which are<br>
arranged in parallel so as to integrate the coated optical fibers<br>
1201 and is made of, for example, an ultraviolet ray curable resin<br>
which Is applied to outer peripheries of the coated optical fibers<br>
1201 with a thickness of h=10|jm or less. Fig. 40A is a plan view of the above-mentioned optical fiber ribbon. As clearly shown<br>
in Fig. 40A, the overall coating layer 12-06 is intermittently<br>
peeled off in the longitudinal direction so that intermittent<br><br>
portions 1207 having no coating layers and exposing the coated optical fibers 1201 are formed. That is, coating portions 1208 where the coating layer 1206 is left and the above-mentioned intermittent layers are alternately arranged. Fig. 40B shows a transverse cross section of the portion which constitutes the above-mentioned coating portion 1208.<br>
Further, in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication She 63(1985)-13008, as shown in Fig. 41, in an optical fiber ribbon 2100, a coated optical fiber 2101 is constituted of a glass fiber 2101a which constitutes a core and a primary coating layer (buffer layer) 2101b which is formed on an outer periphery of the glass fiber 2101a. A plurality of coated optical fibers... 2101 are arranged in-parallel like a ribbon and resin adhesive portions 2102 are formed "at a fixed interval in the lengthwise direction of the ribbon. The resin adhesive portions 2102 are formed of an ultraviolet ray curable resin such as an epoxy acrylate resin, an polybuthadiene acrylate resin, a silicone acrylate resin, for example.<br>
Further, In USP 4,147, 407, as shown in Fig. 42, an optical fiber ribbon 2110 is formed such that a two-layered coating consisting of a primary coating 2112 and a secondary coating 2113 is applied to an outside of each glass fiber 2111 thus forming an optical fiber 2114. A plurality of these optical fibers 2114 are bundled and the secondary coatings 2113-which are once cured are melt by a solvent thus forming a common coating by melting<br><br>
each other.<br>
Further, in Japanese Accepted Patent Publication Sho. 63 (1988)-2085, as shown in Fig. 43, an optical fiber ribbon 2120 constitutes an optical fiber 2123 by forming a coating 2122 on an outside of a glass fiber 2121 and a roving is vertically attached to both sides of the optical fiber 2123 as reinforcing glass fibers 2124. Then, a ribbon-like interwoven body 2126 is obtained by weaving these reinforcing glass fibers 2124 as warps and glass fibers 2125 as wefts, and the interwoven body 2126 is impregnated with a thermosetting resin 2127 and is set to a half-cured state. In this case, the reinforcing glass fibers 2124 which are attached to both sides of the optical fiber 2123 are fastened by the glass fibers 2125 which constitute the wefts and wraps the optical fibers 2123.<br>
Recently, along with the increase of demand for optical communication systems, optical fiber cables using the above-mentioned optical fiber ribbons which constitute optical transmission paths are popularly installed using conduits, poles or the like.<br>
Generally, as the optical fiber cable installed in a communication trunk route such as the conduits and the poles, a tape slot type optical fiber cable has been popularly used (for example, see General Catalogue of optical fiber cable network wiring system, Sumitomo Denki Kogyo, Co., Ltd. issued on August, 2002, page 9).<br><br>
Fig. 44 shows an example of a related-art tape slot type optical fiber cable.<br>
As shown.in Fig. 44, in the related-art tape slot type optical fiber cable 3050, a plurality of optical fiber ribbons 3060 are housed in grooves 3053 formed in a spacer 3052 having a tensile strength body 3051 at the center thereof. The optical fiber cable 3050 is a 100-core type optical fiber cable, wherein five sheets of four-f ibered optical fiber ribbons 3060 are stacked and housed in each one of five grooves 3053. Further, respective grooves 3053 are formed spirally in one direction in a state that they are arranged parallel to each other along the longitudinal direction. Alternatively-, there also exists a n optical fiber cable in which the respective grooves 3053 are formed spirally in the alternatingly inverted manner in the circumferential direction while maintaining a state in which they are arranged parallel to each other in the longitudinal direction. In general, the spacers in which the grooves are formed spirally in one direction are referred to as one-direction twisted spacers and the spacers in which ^the grooves are formed spirally in the alternatingly inverted manner are referred to as SZ spacers.<br>
Further, to prevent the removal of the optical fiber ribbons 3060 from the grooves 3053, a press winding 3054 is wound around a periphery of the spacer 3052 and, at the same time, an outside of the press winding 3054 is covered with a plastic sheath 3055.<br>
The tensile strength body 3051 is a tensile strength body<br><br>
which is provided for preventing the direct transfer of a tensile strength to the optical fiber ribbons 3060 when the tensile strength is applied to the optical fiber cable 3050 and a stejel wire is used as the tensile strength body, for example.<br>
The optical fiber ribbons 3060 are arranged such that four<br>
optical fibers having an outer diameter of 250nm are arranged in parallel such that they are brought into contact with each other, and the whole optical fibers are covered with an ultraviolet ray curable resin and are formed into a ribbon shape. With respect to the contour of the optical fiber ribbon 3060, for example, a thickness thereof is approximately 0.3mm to 0.4mm and a width thereof is approximately 1.1mm. Five optical fiber ribbons 3060 .... which are housed in the inside of one groove 3053 are stacked in a state that they are brought into close contact with each other.<br>
Further, as another configuration of the optical fiber cable installed in a communication trunk route such as conduits, - poles or the like, optical fiber ribbons are housed in a tube-like elongated body. For example, as a loose tube type fiber cable, a following fiber cable has been disclosed (see Proceedings of the 51st IWCS (International Wire &amp; Cable Symposium) pages 22 to 25).<br>
As shown in Fig. 45, six sheets of 12-fibered optical fiber ribbons 4102 each of which collectively covers 12-fibered optical fibers 4101 are interwoven and are housed in the inside of a tube<br><br>
4103, and four pieces of these tubes 4103 are twisted together around a center tensile strength body 4104 in an altematincly inverted manner in the longitudinal direction and, a sheath 4105 is applied thereto.<br>
Although the detailed structure of the 12-fibered optical fiber ribbons 4102 is not described in detail, usually, coated<br>
optical fibers having an outer diameter of 250(om are arranged in parallel and the whole coated optical fibers are covered with an ultraviolet ray curable resin thus forming the optical fiber ribbon in a ribbon shape. Kith respect to outer sizes of the ribbon-shaped body, for example, a thickness thereof is approximately 0 . 3mm to 0 . 4mm and a width thereof is approximately 3.1irtm.<br>
As an optical fiber cable served for an application such as FTTH (Fiber To The Home) or the like, a drop cable which is distributed and dropped from an overhead wiring cable for every one or a plurality of optical fibers can be named (for example, General Catalogue on Optical fiber cable network wiring system, Sumitomo Denki Kogyc Co., Ltd. issued on August, 2002, page 13) . An example of an optical fiher cabile used as the drop cable is shown in Fig. 46.<br>
As shown in Fig. 4 6, a related-art optical fiber cable 5100 is configured such that an element portion 5107 and. amessenger wire portion 5108 are connected by a neck portion 5105.<br>
In the element portion 510", an optical fiber 5101 and<br><br>
two tensile strength bodies 5102 are covered with a sheath 5112 made of a thermoplastic resin. The optical fiber 5101 is formed by covering an cuter periphery of a glass fiber with an ultraviolet<br>
ray curable resin, wherein an outer diameter thereof is 250jj.m, for example. As the "ensile strength body 5102, a linear body made of steel or fiber reinforced plastic (FRP) is used, wherein a contour of a cross section of the tensile strength body 5102 is formed in a circular shape. By collectively covering the optical fiber 5101 and the tensile strength bodies 5102 with the sheath 5103, an external force such as a tensile force or the like added to one optical fiber cable 5100 is received by the tensile strength bodies 5102 so as -to protect the optical fiber 5101 from the external force.<br>
Further, two notches 5104 are formed in an outer periphery of the element portion 5107 such that the notches 5104 are directed to the optical fiber 5101. The notches 5104 are provided for easing the taking out of the optical fiber 5101, wherein at the time of taking out the optical fiber 5101, cuts are formed in portions of the sheath 5102 between two notches 5104 and these portions are torn.<br>
The messenger wire .portion 5108 is configured to have strength to support the optical fiber cable 5100 overhead and is formed by covering a support line 5106 made of steel, FRP or the like with a sheath 5103.<br>
Further, the neck portion 5105 is integrally formed with<br><br>
the element portion 5117 and the messenger wire portion 510 8 using the same resin as the resin of the sheath 5103 for the element portion 5107 and the messenger wire portion 5108.<br>
Although the optical fiber cable 5100 having one optical fiber 5104 is illustrated here, among the related-art drop cables, there exists a drop cable in which two optical fibers are arranged in parallel or, as shown in Fig. 47, there exist a drop cable which includes an optical fiber ribbon 5101a which is produced by a forming a plurality of optical fibers into a ribbon.<br>
The related-art optical fiber ribbon 5101a is formed by<br>
arranging four optical fibers having an outer diameter of 250|m in parallel in a state that four optical fibers are brought into contact with each other and the whole optical fibers are covered with an ultraviolet ray curable resin in a ribbon shape. The size of the outer contour cf the optical fiber ribbon is such that a thickness thereof is approximately 0.3mm to 0.4mm and a width thereof is approximately 1.1mm.<br>
Here, with respect tc the above-mentioned optical fiber cable which is installed in the communication trunk route shown in Fig. 4 4 and Fig. 45, tc wire the optical fiber to a subscriber-side building or the like from a housing station, there may be cases in which the housed optical fiber ribbons are pulled out and any arbitrary optical fibers out of the pulled cut optical fiber ribbons are connected with optical fibers at the subscribers side.<br>
In the related-art tape slot type optical fiber cable shown<br><br>
in Fig. 44, first cf all, the sheath and the press winding are peeled off from an arbitrary portion of the installed optical fiber cable by a given length and, thereafter, desired optical fiber ribbons are pulled cut from the grooves . Then/ given optical fibers are branched from the pulled-out optical fiber ribbons and are connected to the optical fibers at the subscriber side.<br>
Further, with respect: to the related-art loose tube type optical fiber cable shown in Fig. 45, first of all, the sheath is peeled off from an arbitrary portion of the installed optical fiber cable by a given length, the desired tubes are pulled out and, thereafter, the coatings of the tubes are removed so as to pull out the desired optical fiber ribbons. Then, given optical fibers are branched from the pulled-out optical fiber ribbons and are connected to the optical fibers at.the subscriber side.<br>
Further, with respect :o the optical fiber cable 5100 shown in Fig. 46, when the optical fiber cable 5100 is introduced into the inside of a housing from overhead, the messenger wire portion 5108 for supporting the optical fiber cable overhead becomes unnecessary and hence, the neck portion 5105 is torn so as tc divide the element portion 5107 and the messenger wire portion 5108 . Then, the optical fiber cable which is constituted of only the element portion 51G7 is wired in the housing.<br>
With respect re the optical fiber cable 5100a shown in Fig. 47, after wiring the optical fiber cable 5100 in the inside of a housing, the coated optical fiber ribbon 5101a is taken out<br><br>
and the arbitrary optical fibers out of the taken-out optical<br>
fiber ribbon 5101a are connected to optical fibers at the<br>
subscribers side.	- -<br>
In this case, first of all, the sheath 5103 is torn at an arbitrary portion of the wired optical fiber cable 5100a seas to take out the optical fiber ribbon 5101a. Then, desired optical fibers are branched from the taken-out optical fiber ribbon 5101a and are connected to the optical fibers at the subscribers side.<br>
Since the optical fiber cable which is already wired includes optical fibers through which optical signals are transmitted, there has been .requested an operation to branch optical fibers which are not used as transmission paths from an intermediate portion of the optical fiber ribbon in which some optical fibers are used as the transmission paths while suppressing the deterioration of transmission quality (so-called live-line branching operation). Accordingly, in branching the desired optical fibers, a demand for a branching method which is referred to as an intermediate post branching in which desired optical fibers are branched from an intermediate portion of a taken-out optical fiber ribbon without cutting- the optical fiber ribbon has been increasing.<br>
However, with respect to the optical fiber ribbon which is housed in the related-art optical fiber cable, it is difficult to remove resin which covers a plurality of optical fibers and,<br><br>
particularly, under the current situation it is difficult to perform the intermediate post branching by selecting one optical fiber out of the plurality of optical fibers.<br>
For example, in an attempt to shave off the resin using a sandpaper or a tool such as a planer, there exists a possibility that the optical fiber is damaged or cut.<br>
Under such circumstances, in the related art, the intermediate post branching cannot be performed and hence, to branch a desired optical fiber, all of a plurality of optical fibers which are integrally formed as an optical fiber ribbon are cut and, thereafter, a single optical fiber is branched from the cut portion of the optical fiber ribbon. Accordingly, it is impossible to perform the live-line branching operation of the optical fiber ribbon including the optical fibers in the using state (that is, in the live state) as the transmission path.<br>
Further, when the optical fiber ribbon is cut, the remaining optical fibers other than the optical fibers which are connected at the cut portion cannot be used as the transmission path thus pushing up a cost for constructing an optical communication network.<br>
Further, recently, the demand for long-distance transmission of the high-speed signals of high packing density has been increasing in the information communication and the reduction of polarization mode dispersion (PMD) of the optical fiber which becomes a factor to restrict the long-distance<br><br>
transmission has been requested. However, in the optical fiber cable shown in Fig. 4£ -which houses the optical fiber ribbon ir. the tube, the ribbon is twisted in the tube and, further, the tube is twisted around the tensile strength body at the center and hence, the ribbon is deformed in the tube and hence, there arises a drawback that the refractive birefringence is generated due to a stress which the optical fiber receives from resin sc that the PMD is increased.<br>
Disclosure of Invention<br>
Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention tc provide an optical fiber ribbon in which the optical fiber ribbor. can be formed by surely integrating a plurality of optical fibers, the optical fibers can be easily branched in an optical fiber branching operation, and the increase of transmission loss of the optical fibers can be suppressed at the time of performing live-line branching.<br>
It is also an object of the present invention to provide an optical fiber cable which can perform the intermediate post branching of an optical fiber ribbon housed in an optical fiber -.- cable.<br>
It is another object cf the present invention to provide an optical fiber cable which can realize the easy intermediate post branching of an optical fiber ribbon housed in an optical fiber cable and, at the same time, can reduce PMD.<br><br>
In order to accomplish the obj ect above, the following means are adopted. According to thepresent invention, there isprovidec an optical fiber ribbon comprising:<br>
a plurality of optical fibers which are arranged in parallel; and<br>
a resin which integrates the plurality of optical fibers over the whole length of the optical fibers, the optical fibers and the resin being in a state that the optical fibers and the resin are closely adhered to each other,<br>
wherein assuming a maximum value of a thickness of the optical fiber ribbon as T (pun) and an outer diameter of the optical fiber as d(jam), a relationship T 
In the optical fiber ribbon""with such a structure, the sheath and the optical fibers are not separated at manufacturing the optical fiber cable or wiring work because the optical fibers and the sheath are closely adhered to each other. Further, when it needs to branch the optical fiber from a portion other than the end portion of the optical fiber ribbon, because the sheath is thin, the cracks are generated in the sheath, the sheath is peeled off and thus the optical fiber can be easily branched. Furthermore, when the optical fiberswhich are not used are branched from the optical fiber ribbon already installed in which some optical fibers are used as transmission paths (so called live-line branching operation), the increase of the transmission loss of the optical fiber can be suppressed.<br><br>
In the optical fiber ribbon, preferably, the plurality of optical fibers are integrated by covering the whole periphery of rhe plurality cf optical fibers in a parallel.!y arranged state with the resin.<br>
Further, a recessed portion may be formed in the resin corresponding to an indentation between the neighboring optical fibers,<br>
According to the optical fiber ribbon with such a structure, for example, cracks are not generated in the sheath at manufacturing the optical fiber cable or wiring work and thus the optical fibers are securely integrated without separation of the optical fibers. Further, when it needs to branch the optical fibers from the optical fiber ribbon, the sheath can be peeled of f easily from the recessed portion of the sheath and thus the optical fibers can be branched. Further, at live-line branching operation, the increase of the transmission loss cf the optical fiber can be suppressed.<br>
In order to accomplish the object above, an optical fiber ribbon, according to the present invention, comprising:<br>
a plurality of optical fibers which are arranged inparallel in a state that the optical fibers are in contact with each other; and<br>
a resin which integrates the plurality of optical fibers by covering the whole peripheries of the plurality of the optical fibers,<br>
wherein the resin is formed over the whole length of the<br><br>
optical fiber ribbon = nd, at the same time, the resin disposed<br>
in a recessedportion fcrr.ed between the neighboring optical fibers<br>
-does not exceed a common tangent of the neighboring optical fibers .<br>
According to the optical fiber ribbon with such a structure, since the recessed portion of the sheath which covers the indentation between the optical fibers does not exceed a common tangent of the neighboring optical fibers, the recessed portion of the sheath becomes deeper in accordance with the shape of the indentation between the optical fibers. Since the sheath at the recessed portion can be made thin in the thickness, the sheath can be peeled off easily and thus the optical fibers can be branched when the "optical fibers are branched.<br>
Further, in order to accomplish the object above, an optical fiber cable, according to the present invention, having one or a plural sheets of optical fiber ribbons, the optical fiber ribbon comprising a plurality cf optical fibers which are arranged in parallel and a resin which integrates the plurality of optical fibers over the whole length of the optical fibers, the optical fibers and the resin being in a state that the optical fibers and the resin are closely adhered to each other,<br>
wherein assuming a maximum value of a thickness of the<br>
optical fiber ribbon as T (|im) and an outer diameter cf the optical<br>
fiber as d(jjm), a relationship T 
The optical fiber ribbon may configured such that the<br>
plurality of optical fibers are integrated by covering the whole<br><br>
periphery of the plurality of optical fibers in a paralleliy' arranged state with the resin.  Further, a recessed portion may be formed in the resin if the optical fiber ribbon corresponding to an indentation betvreen the neighboring optical fibers.<br>
According to the optical fiber cable with such a structure, the thickness of the resin which integrates the plurality of the optical fibers is thinner compared with the related-art thickness, and thus the intermediate post branching work can be performed' easily. Therefore, the optical fibers, for which the intermediate post branching are not performed, in the optical fiber ribbon can be taken cut from the optical fiber cable at the other potion, and connected, and thus it is possible to effectively make use of the""plural optical fibers housed in the optical fiber cable. ■<br>
The above-mentioned optical fiber cable may further comprises a spacer having an approximately columnar .plastic elongated body including a tensile strength body at a center thereof,<br>
wherein an apprcximately spirally grooves are formed on an outer peripheral face of the elongated body, and one or the plural sheets of optical fiber ribbons are stacked and housed in the inside of the groove.<br>
Further, the aheve-mentioned optical fiber cable may further comprising:<br>
an approximately cylindrical elongated tube in which one or the plural sheets cf optical fiber ribbons are housed in a<br><br>
stacked manner.<br>
The abtve-ment: ined optical fiber cable also may further comprising:<br>
a sheath for covering one or the plural sheets of the optical fiber ribbon.<br>
Furthermore, in order to accomplish the object above, an optical fiber cable, according to the present invention, having one or a plural sheets of optical fiber ribbons, the optical fiber ribbon comprising a plurality of optical fibers which are arranged in parallel in a state that the optical fibers are in contact with each other; and a resin which integrates the plurality of optical fibers by covering the whole peripheries of the plurality of the optical fibers,<br>
wherein the resin is formed over the whole length of the optical fiber ribbon and, at the same time, the resin disposed m a recessedpcrtion f crmedbetween the neighboring optical fibers does not exceea a common tangent of the neighboring optical fibers .<br>
According to the optical fiber cable with such a structure, the thickness of the resin which integrates the plurality of the optical fibers is thinner compared with the related-art thickness, and thus the intermediate pest branching work can be performed easily. Therefore, the optical fibers, for which the intermediate post branching are net performed, in the optical fiber ribbon can be taken out from the optical fiber cable at the other potion, and connected, and thus it is possible to effectively make .use<br><br>
of the plural optical fibers housed in the optical fiber cable.<br>

Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
Hereinafter, embodiments of an optical fiber ribbon, manufacturing method thereof and an optical fiber cable according to the present invention are explained in detail in conjunction<br><br>
with attached drawings.<br>
Fig. 1A is a cross-sectional view showing a first embodiment of the optical fiber ribbon according to the present invention and Fig. IB is a perspective view of the optical fiber ribbon. The optical fiber ribbon 10 is formed by arranging a plurality of (four pieces as an example in this embodiment) optical fibers 11 in parallel and applying a sheath 12 over the whole outer periphery of these optical fibers 11 arranged in parallel and over the entire length of the optical fibers 11. The sheath 12 is closely adhered to the optical fibers 11.<br>
In the optical fiber ribbon according to the present<br>
■-• invention, as shown in Fig. 1A, the optical fibers are brought<br>
into contact with each other. Here, "brought into contact with" —<br>
includes a case in which there exists an interval between<br>
neighboring optical fibers of the optical fiber ribbon of equal<br>
to or less than 10pm as a manufacturing error. When the optical fibers included in the optical fiber ribbon are brought into contact with each other, the optical fiber ribbon can be easily branched. Even when the optical fibers are not brought into contact with each other, so long as the interval between the neighboring optical<br>
fibers of the optical fiber ribbon is equal to or less than 10pm, an amount of resin which forms the sheath and intrudes between the optical fibers is small and hence, branching can be performed easily. The optical fiber 11 is constituted of a glass fiber 13 which consists of core 13a and a clad 13b, a protective coating<br><br>
14 which covers an outer periphery of the glass fiber 13, and a color layer which covers an outer periphery 15 of the protective coating 14. Further, the outer periphery 15 may constitute a secondary protective film and the color layer having a thickness<br>
of approximately 1pm. to 10pm may be formed on the outer periphery 15.  Further, thin film-like carbon layer may be formed on the<br>
periphery of the glass fiber 13 by coating. Here, it is preferable<br>
that the optical fiber 11 conforms to G652 prescribed in ITU-T<br>
(International Telecommunication Union - Telecommunication<br>
standardization sector).<br>
As the glass fiber 13 which can be used in the present invention, a glass fiber having any di-stribution of refractive index can be used including a glass fiber which is formed of a core and a multi-layered clad or the like . Further, as the optical fiber 11, an optical fiber which is formed by covering an outer periphery of the glass fiber 13 with the protective coating 14 may be used.<br>
In this optical fiber ribbon 10, an ultraviolet ray curable resin is applied to the outer peripheries of four optical fibers 11 arranged in parallel as the sheath 12. As the material of the sheath 12, a thermoplastic resin, a thermosetting resin or the like can be used besides the ultraviolet ray curable resin.<br>
The sheath 12 which covers the optical fibers 11 is formed of a flat portion 18 which is substantially parallel to a common tangent S2 which is formed by the optical fibers 11, 11 at a region<br><br>
where the optical fibers 11, 11 are arranged in parallel . When a wall thickness t of the sheath 12 of the optical fiber ribbon<br>
10	is made small, even v;hen the sheath 12 is formed by applying a resin which forms the sheath 12 to the optical fibers 11 using a die 27 as shown in Fig. 9, there may be a case that a minute indentation is generated on the sheath 12 of the optical fiber ribbon 10 such that the sheath 12 conforms to a contour of the optical fibers 11. The flat portion 18 according to the present invention includes such a case. When the optical fibers 11 are branched from the optical fiber ribbon 10, the optical fibers<br>
11	can be easily branched by peeling off the sheath 12 of the flat portion 18 by a manual operation of an operator or using a branching tool. With respect to the optical fiber ribbon according to the present invention, it has been confirmed that a thickness of the sheath of the optical fiber ribbon has some influence from a viewpoint of achievement of the favorable branching operability and the suppression of the increase of transmission loss at the time of live-line branching.<br>
Table 1 shows the relationship among an outer diameter d of the optical fiber, a maximum thickness T of the optical fiber ribbon and the thickness t of the sheath. The table is served for evaluating the branching property, loose coil PMD and cable PMD of the optical fiber ribbon. Here, the thickness t of the sheath is a wall thickness of the sheath outside the common tangent S2 of respective optical fibers of the optical fiber ribbon.<br><br><br>
In Table 1, as shown in Fig, 1, the fiber diameter means the cuter diameter d cf the optical fiber 11, ribbon thickness is the maximum thickness T of the optical fiber ribbon 10, and the sheath thickness is a length t between the common tangent S2 cf the optical fibers 11 and the flat portion 18 of the sheath 12 .  The outer diameter cf the optical fibers of the optical fiber<br>
ribbon shown in Table 1 is 250)am.<br>
Eranching property shown in Table 1 indicates the easiness of branching at the ti~e of branching an intermediate portion cf the optical fiber ribbon into respective optical fibers while suppressing the increase of transmission loss to 1.0 dB or less. "good" indicates that the branching can be performed in a time exceeding two minutes andwithin threeminutes and "fair" indicates "hat the branching car. be performed in a time exceeding three minutes and within 5 minutes. When the evaluation of branching property is either "good" cr "fair", the increase of the transmission loss at the time of branching is equal to or less than I.0d3 so that the live-line branching can be performed.<br>
The optical fiber ribbon shown in Table 1, exhibits the<br>
relationship T 
 <br>
exhibit the branching property superior to "fair", wherein the intermediate post blanching can be performed within five minutes by setting the increase of the transmission loss at the time of branching to equal to cr less than l.OdB. That is, the live line branching can be performed within 5 minutes. With respect tc the related-art optical fiber ribbon, the increment of the transmission loss at the time of branching exceeds 1. OdB or the related-art optical fiber ribbon requires a given time which exceeds five minutes even when the optical fibers can be separatee and hence, the live-line branching cannot be performed from a realistic point of view. According to the optical fiber ribbon shown in Table 1, provided that the ribbon thickness is equal<br>
to cr less than 280jam, chat is, the relationship T 
With respect to che above-mentioned live-line branching, one example of the branching method is explained. As shown in Fig. 2A, the optical fiber ribbon 10 is sandwiched between an upper base 61 and a lower base 52 of a branching tool 60, wherein wire rods 63 which are formed on these upper and lower bases 61, 62 in an erected manner are made to approach flat portions 1£ of the sheath 12 of the optical fiber ribbon 10. Fig. 2B shows the cross section of such a structure. Further, by pressing the branching tool 60 to the optical fiber ribbon 10, as shown in Fig. 2C, the wire rods 65 are deflected and sharp corners of distal<br><br>
ends of the def lectedwire rods 63 are stronglybrought into contact with the flat portions IS of the sheath 12 of the optical fiber ribbon 10.<br>
By moving the branching tool 60 relative to the optical fiber ribbon 10 in the longitudinal direction (the left-and-right direction, in Fig. 2C) cf the optical fiber ribbon 10 in a state that the branching tool 60 is pressed to the optical fiber ribbon 10, that is, by rubbing the optical fiber ribbon 10 with the branching tool 60, flaws are formed on the flat portions 18 or portions of the sheath are peeled off by the distal ends of the wire rod 63 and hence, the optical fibers 11 are branched. Either one or both of the branching tool 60 and the optical fiber ribbon 10 may be moved. The wire rods 63 are resilient and hence, when the wire rods 63 are pressed to the flat portions of the optical fiber ribbon, the wire rods 63 are deflected and the corner portions of the distal ends of the wire rods 63 are brought into contact with the flat portions 18. By moving the branching tool 60 or the optical fiber ribbon 10 in such a state, the wire rods 63 (flexible member) imparts flaws to the flat portions 18 or peel off the flat portion 18.<br>
By repeating rubbing of the optical fiber ribbon 10 using the branching tool 60, an interface between the color layer 15 of the optical fiber 11 and the sheath 12 of the flat portion 18 is peeled off. When the rubbing is further repeated, portions of the flat portions 18 above or below the center axes of the<br><br>
optical fiber 11 are shaved off and cracks are generated and thereafter, the cracks fcrmed in the flat portions 18 are developec by the "stress concentration and hence, the flat portions 18 are peeled off. In this manner, the sheath 12 of the optical fiber ribbon 10 is ruptured and the optical fiber ribbon 10 is branched into the respective optical fibers.<br>
By adjusting the power by which the resilient materials 63 is pressed to the optical fiber ribbon 10, a change amount of transmission loss of optical signals at the time of branching becomes equal to or less than l.OdBDb. Further, depending or. the manner of branching, such a change amount of transmission loss can be reduced to a value equal to or less than 0.5dB. Accordingly, even when the optical fiber ribbon includes live lines, the optical fiber ribbon can be branched without cutting the live lines even in a moment.<br>
To review the branching property of the optical fiber ribbons shown in Table 1, the smaller the thickness of the sheath, it is possible to have the better branching property. Although<br>
when the thickness of the sheath t is 20 jun, the evaluation of thebranchingproperty is "fair", when the thickness of the sheath<br>
t is equal to or less than 15 ]xra,~ the evaluation of the branching property is "good". That is, the smaller the thickness of the flat portion 18 of the sheath 12, peeling off of the sheath 12 becomes easier.<br>
In the same manner, the .evaluation of the loose coil PMD<br><br>
and the cable PMD is examined. The loose coil PMD is the polarized mode dispersion in a st^:e that the optical fiber ribbons are loosely coiled in a circular shape and the cable PMD is the pplarized mode dispersion when the optical fiber ribbons are formed into a cable. With respect :: the evaluation of the loose coil PMD and the cable PMD, the symbol "good" shows a case in which they<br>
assume a value 0.05<pmd and the symbol shows a case in which they assume value . with respect to evaluation of loose coil pmd or cable shown table although when thickness sheath is></pmd>
the sheath is lOjim, ofim, the evaluation is "good".<br>
That is, when the"ribbon thickness assumes the relationship<br>
T 
Further, it is considered that, by making the sheath thin, the curing shrinking stress at the time of integration of the optical fibers can be made small and the PMD can be improved.<br>
Further, although not shown in Table 1, with respect to<br><br>
the optical fiber ribbon having the thickness of more than 290|im, that is, the optical fiber ribbon having the thickness exceeding<br>
d+40(jim) , it is possible to favorably ensure the integrality of the optical fiber ribbon that the optical fibers are not separated<br>
when the optical fiber ribbon is formed into a cable. However, this takes a long time at the time of performing the branching andhence, it is favorable that the maximum thickness of the optical<br>
fiber ribbon is made equal to cr less than d-MO^im. In this case, it is favorable that the thickness t of the sheath t is equal<br>
to or less than 20|om. tr.is implies that it is favorable that, in Fig. 1, the thickness t of the portion of the sheath above the optical fibers and the thickness t of the sheath below the optical fibers are substantially equal. In this case, the cores 13a of the optical fibers 11 are positioned almost at the center in the thickness direction of the optical fiber ribbon 10 and hence, when the optical fiber ribbons are connected to each ether, the positions of the ceres cf both optical fiber ribbons are substantially aligned with each other whereby the connection loss is small.<br><br>
Table 2 shows the relationship among the outer diameter<br><br>
d cf optical fibers of the optical fiber ribbon using optical<br>
fibers having an outer tiameter of 12Sum, the maximum thickness T cf the optical fiber ribbon and the thickness t of the sheath. The explanation of the thickness of the sheath, the branching property of the optical fiber ribbon, the loose coil PMD and the cable PMD and the explanation cf the symbol "good" and the symbol "fair" of the evaluation are similar to those explained in conjunction with Table I and hence, these explanations are omitted here.<br>
When the ribbon thickness is 165pm, the relationship T 
d+4 0pm is established and the evaluation of the branching property is "fair". This implies that the live-line branching can be performed when it is possible to takes time . Further, withrespect to the case in which the ribbon thickness is equal to or less<br>
than 155|am, that is, the relationship T<d is established the evaluation of branching property and></d>
live-line branching were able to be favorably performed within two or three minutes.<br>
Although not shewn in Table 2, with respect to the optical fiber ribbon having the ribbon thickness exceeding 165pm, that is, the fiber diameter cf equal to cr more than d-MOpm, the time necessary for performing the branching without increasing the loss of the optical fibers is prolonged (for example, it takes more than 5 minutes) and hence, it is favorable that the ribbon thickness T is equal to or less than the fiber diameter d+40)im.<br><br>
"Accordingly, it is favcrable that the thickness t of the sheath<br>
t is equal to cr less than I5um in the same manner as Table 1.<br>
In reviewing the loose coil PMD and the cable PMD in Table<br>
2, although the evaluation is "fair" when the thickness of the<br>
sheath is 201am, 15|im, the evaluation is "good" when the thickness of the sheath is lOpm, 5um. When the sheath and the flat portions of the sheath are thin, the optical fiber ribbon is easily deflected cr easily bent and hence, the optical fibers are not separated and the optical fiber ribbon can be easily formed into a loose coil state and, further, "he optical fiber ribboncan easily conform to the curve of the slot grooves of the cable. Further, when the sheath is formed chin, it is considered that the curing-shrinking stress at the time cf integrating the optical fibers can be decreased and hence, the PMD can be improved. To take the PMD of the optical fibers into consideration, the relationship<br>
T<d is favorable.></d>
In manufacturing the optical fiber ribbon, as shown in<br>
Fig. 3, there may be a case that the respective optical fibers<br>
I1A, IIB, 11C, 11D are not aligned on the same plane.  In the<br>
drawing, the sheath 12 has the desired thickness t at the optical<br>
fibers 11 A, 11D, while the optical fiber 11B, lie are offset and<br>
hence; the sheath does net have the desired thickness at the optical<br>
fiber IIB, 11C. The sheath 12 at the optical fiber 11B is thinner<br>
than the desired thickness at the upper flat portion 18Uand thicker<br>
than the desired thickness at the lower flat portion 18L. On<br><br>
the other hand, with respect to the optical fiber 11C, the sheath 12 is made thicker at the upper flat portion 18U and thinner at the lower flat portion 18L. In such an optical fiber ribbon, in regions thereof where the desired thickness of the sheath is ' not obtained, it is favorable that a ratio between the maximum value and the minimum value, that is, the maximum value/minimum value of the thickness cf the sheath at the thinner side is equal to or less than 3.<br>
That is, in the optical fiber ribbon shown in Fig. 3, the thickness tL of the thinner sheath of the lower flat portion 18L of the optical fiber 11C has the maximum value and the thickness tS of the thinner sheath of-the upper flat portion 18U of the optical fiber 11B has the minimum value, wherein the relationship<br>
tL/tS 

can be prevented. Although the optical fiber ribbon shown in<br>
Fig. 3 uses the four optical fibers, it is not limited to this<br>
number.- That is, with respect to the optical fiber ribbon using<br>
a multiplicity of optical fibers, when the thickness of the sheath<br>
is offset from the d-esired thickness, the maximum value and the<br>
minimum value of the thickness of the thinner-side sheath are<br>
respectively obtained. If the ratio between the maximum value<br>
and the minimum value of the thickness of the thinner-side sheath<br>
is equal to or less than 3, the optical fiber ribbon can be used<br><br>
properly.<br>
At the time of manufacturing the optical fiber ribbon, curing shrinking is generated when the sheath is cured. There is a tendency that the stress acting on the optical fibers due to this curing shrinking is increased corresponding to the increase of the Young's modulus of the sheath. Further, when a strain is generated in the glass fiber of the optical fiber, the PMD is likely to be increased and an amount of increase of the PMD depends on a magnitude of the stress which reaches to the glass fiber through a coating layer (a color layer, a protective layer or the like) of the glass fiber. Accordingly, by setting a ratio between a product of Young's modulus and a cross-sectional area of the sheath and a product of Young' s modulus and'a cross-sectional grea of the optical fiber (referred to as ES product ratio) to a value within a desired range or to a value equal to or less than a desired value, the PMD can be decreased.<br><br><br>
Table 3 shows the relationship between the ES product ratio and the loose coil PMD with respect to the optical fiber ribbon<br>
using the optical fibers having the diameter of 250|jin and 125(xm. The glass diameter in Table 3 indicates the outer diameter of the glass fiber portion, the outer diameter indicates the outer diameter of the optical fiber, and the ribbon thickness indicates the maximum thickness of the optical fiber ribbon. The ES product ratio is a ratio between the product of Young's modulus E and the cross-sectional area S of the sheath (resin) 12 and the sum of products of the Young' s moduli E and the cross-sectional areas S of the respective optical fibers 11.<br>
That is, as shown in Fig. 4, in the transverse cross section of the optical fiber ribbon 10, in an inner region which is defined by two straight lines (for example, dotted lines X, Y shown in Fig. 4) which are orthogonal to a straight line which connects the respective centers of the two neighboring optical fibers lib, lie and pass through the respective centers of these two optical<br><br>
fibers lib, lie, assuming the cross-sectional areas of the sheaths 12U, 12L as SI, the Young's modulus of these sheath as El, the sum of the cross-sectional areas of the optical,fibers lib, lie as S2, and the Young's modulus of the optical fibers lib, lie as E2, the ES product ratio can be obtained by an equation ES<br>
product ratio = (ElxSl)/ (E2xS2). Here, the ES product (E2xS2) of the optical fibers lib, lie means the sum of the ES products of the respective materials which constitute the optical fibers. That is, the ES product of the optical fiber 11 shown in Fig. 1 means the sum of the ES products of respective Young's moduli and cross-sectional areas of the core 13a, the clad 13b, the protective film 14 and the color layer 15 which constitute the optical fiber 11'.<br>
The optical fiber which is used for the example shown in Table 3 is constituted by applying the first and the second protective coatings to a glass fiber made of a core clad and further by applying the color coating to the outer periphery of the second protective coating. With respect to the Young's modulus of this optical fiber, the Young's modulus of the glass fiber is 73000 (MPa), the Young's modulus of the primary protective coating 1 is 1 (MPa) , the Young' s modulus of the secondary protective coating is 700 (MPa) , and the Young's modulus of the color coating is 1500(MPa).<br>
With respect to the evaluations of-the loose coil PMD in Table 3, "very good" indicates that the polarized mode dispersion<br><br>
(PMD) is equal to or less than 0.05 (ps/km1/2) , "good" indicates that the polarized mode dispersion (PMD) falls in a range of 0.05<br>
PMD
2501am, provided that the relationship T<d is established the es product ratio becomes equal to or less than and hence loose coil pmd extremely favorable. further with></d>
respect to the optical fiber having the outer diameter of 125|xm, provided that the relationship T<d is established the es product ratio becomes equal to or less than and hence></d>
loose coil PMD becomes favorable. Further, by using the optical fiber having the sheath whose Young' s modulus is equal to or more than 200 MPa, the respective optical fiber ribbons are not separated into respective optical fibers and hence, the sheath thickness<br><br>
can be reduced. Further, when the sheath thickness canbe reduced, the sheath can be easily peeled off and hence, the live-line branching can be easily performed. Further, the optical fiber ribbon canbe easily bent and hence, the loose coil PMD is enhanced. When the optical fiber ribbonhas amulti-layered (n layers) sheath,<br>
as the ElxSl of the optical fiber ribbon, a sum of ES product ratios of the respective layers can be used.<br>
In the optical fiber ribbon according to the present invention, it is favorable that the mode field diameter (MFD) according to the definition of Petermann-I at the wavelength of 1.55|am of the optical fiber is equal to or less than 10|im and<br>
it is more favorable that the'MFD is 8fim. With such a small MFD, themacrobend loss of the optical fiber canbe suppressed. Further,<br>
the sheath of the optical fiber ribbon is thin and is easily bendable<br>
(easily deflectable) and hence, when the side pressure is applied<br>
to the optical fiber ribbon, the increase of the macrobend loss<br>
due to the side pressure can be suppressed.<br>
At the same time, it is favorable that the cable cut-off<br>
wavelength of the glass fiber of the optical fiber is equal to<br>
or less than 1.26pm. The cable cut-off wavelength indicates a cut-off wavelength of LPn mode at 22m length and is a value smaller<br>
than a 2m cut-off wavelength.<br>
Further, in the optical fiber ribbon according to the<br>
present invention, the adhesive strengthbetween the optical fiber<br>
and the sheath sometimes affects the increase of the transmission<br><br>
loss and the live-line operation efficiency at the time of performing the live-line branching. With respect to the adhesive strength of the optical fiber 11 and the sheath 12, to take the prevention of the increase of the transmission loss and the branching operability into consideration, it is favorable that the adhesive strength per one optical fiber falls within a range 0.245 (mN) to 2.45(mN). When the above-mentioned adhesive strength is smaller than the above-mentioned range, there may arise a case that the sheath 12 is ruptured at the time of being formed into a cable and the optical fibers 11 are separated from each other. On the other hand, when the adhesive strength is larger than the above-mentioned range, the branching property is deteriorated.<br>
The adhesive strength between the optical fibers and the sheath can be measured by a following method. As shown in Fig. 5, a blade C of a retractable knife is brought into contact with one side of the optical fiber ribbon 10 and the blade cuts into the optical fiber ribbon 10 until the blade reaches an interface between the optical fibers and the sheath. By moving the blade in the longitudinal direction toward an end portion of the optical fiber ribbon 10, the sheath at one side of the ribbon is peeled off. The sheath 12 at the opposite side of the end portion of the optical fiber ribbon 10 is peeled off and is folded back using a hand. As shown in Fig. 6, the optical fiber 11 whose sheath is peeled off is held by a lower chuck 50L and a distal end of<br><br>
the sheath 12 which is folded back is clamped by an upper chuck 50U. The distance between the upper and the lower chucks 50L, 50U is set to approximately 4 0mm. The upper chuck 50U and the lower chuck 50L are moved in directions which make a relative angle of 180 degree therebetween at a speed of 200mm/minute by 50mm and hence, the sheath 12 is peeled off.<br>
Four values in total consisting of a maximum value, a minimum value, a second maximum value and a secondminimum value are sampled from measured values, an average value thereof is obtained and, then, a value obtained by dividing the average value by the number of optical fibers included in the optical fiber ribbon is used ■- as the adhesive strength per an optical fiber ribbon.<br>
In the optical fiber ribbon 10 according to the present invention, when a main object of the invention lies in that the optical fibers 11 keep the integrity without being separated from each other, it is favorable that the thickness of the sheath is<br>
equal to or more than 0.5[xm.  In this case, the maximum thickness<br>
T of the optical fiber ribbon 10 becomes T£ outer diameter of<br>
the optical fiber d+1 (pin) .<br>
Also depending on the properties of the sheath 12 of the<br>
■- optical fiber ribbon 10, in some cases, these properties affect<br>
the increase of the transmission loss and the branching operation<br>
efficiency at the live-line branching. It is preferable that<br>
the yield point stress, as the property of material of the sheath,<br>
falls within a range of 20MPa to 45Mpa. This is because that<br><br>
the branching operation can be performed easily and the transmission loss at the time of performing the live-line branching can be^suppressed. In accordance with JIS K7113, the yield point stress is measured with respect to a No.2 test piece at a tension speed of 50mm/minute. When the yield point stress is less than 20MPa, there arises a case in which the respective optical fibers are separated by an external force which is applied to the optical fibers during a step of assembling the optical fiber ribbons to form a cable and hence, the cable cannot be formed. On the other hand, when the yield point stress exceeds 45MPa, it is difficult to rupture the sheath and hence, the intermediate post blanching of the optical fiber ribbon is hard toperform. The yield point stress can be adjusted by changing the material of the sheath. When an ultraviolet ray curable resin is used as the sheath material, by increasing the oligomer concentration and by increasing the urethane group concentration or the double bond concentration, the yield point stress is increased. Further, as the sheath material, a monomer which includes a polar group such as N-vinyi-pyrrolidone, N-vinyl-caproiactum or the like also can be used.<br>
-Tiie ^ung'^^^		-<br>
manner. First, a sheet is prepared by using a resin which forms the sheath 12. Then, by using a test piece which is formed into a JIS No. 2 dumbbell defined in JIS K7113," the sheet is pulled under the condition that the distance between gage marks is 25mm<br><br>
and the tension speed is Imm/min. Here, the tension secant elastic modulus is calculated based on the tension strength at the time<br>
of 2.5,% elongation.<br>
According to the experiment, it is understood that, when<br>
the Young's modulus of the sheath 12 exceeds 1200MPa, the sheath 12 is too hard, while when the thickness of the sheath 12 is large, the branching property of the optical fiber 11 is deteriorated. On the other hand, when the Young's modulus of the sheath 12 is equal to or less than 200MPa, the sheath 12 is too soft and is broken during a next step of manufacturing of cables and hence, the integrated state cannot be maintained. Accordingly, it is favorable that the Young's modulus of*■■ the sheath 12 is set to equal to or less than 1200MPa and more than 200MPa.<br>
Further, the branching and integration also relate to the rupture elongation of the resin which forms the sheath 12. When<br>
the elongation is equal to or less than 60%, the optical fibers 11 can be easily branched. However, when the elongation is equal<br>
to or less than 10%, the optical fibers are cracked during the next process of manufacturing the cable and hence, the integration state cannot be maintained. Accordingly, it is favorable that<br>
the rupture elongation is equal to or less than 60% and more than<br>
10%.<br>
Further, the tension rupture elongation can be measured<br>
in the following manner. First, a sheet 'is prepared by using a resin which forms the sheath 12. Then, a tension rupture<br><br>
elongation ratio (%) is obtained based on the elongation ratio of the JIS NO.2 test piece which is defined in JIS K7113 when the test piece is ruptured by tension under the condition that the tension speed is 50mm/min.<br>
To prepare the blending of the ultraviolet ray curable resin having the above-mentioned Young's modulus, the Young's modulus can be increased by reducing a molecular weight of the oligomer or by increasing an addition amount of bifunctional monomer such as ethylene oxide modified bisphenol A diacrylate or the like-Further, in performing the blending of the resin to make the resin have the above-mentioned rupture elongation, it is possible to increase the rupture elongation by increasing a molecular weight in diol in the oligomer molecules such as PTMG or the like or by reducing an addition amount of bifunctional monomer such as ethylene oxide modified bisphenol A diacrylate or the like.<br>
Even when such conditions are satisfied, when the transmission loss at the time of branching the optical fibers 11 is large, the optical fiber cable is not suitable as a product. That is, when the increase of the transmission loss at the time of branching becomes larger than l.OdB, there is a possibility that the communication is interrupted. Accordingly, the optical fiber ribbon whose increase of transmission loss at the time of branching is equal to or less than 1. OdB is the optical fiber<br><br>
ribbon which can be served for live-line branching and hence is preferable.  It is more preferable that the transmission loss -at the time of branching is equal to or less than 0.5dB.<br>
Here, the measurement of the transmission loss at the time of branching the optical fiber 11 is performed as follows, for example. One end face of the optical fiber ribbon 10 is connected to a light source and the other end face of the optical fiber ribbon 10 is connected to a light receiver. Then, light having<br>
a wavelength of 1.55pm which is emitted from a light source is incident on the optical fibers 11 and power (for example, waveforms converted into voltage) received by the receiver is monitored. When the -loss is generated due to the disturbance generated by branching, the power is attenuated and hence, the transmission loss can be calculated based on this attenuation amount.<br>
Further, with respect to the glass fiber 13 of the optical fiber 11, the macrobend loss at the bending diameter of 15mm at<br>
a wavelength of 1.55jim is set to a value equal to or less than O.ldB/turn.  The macrobend loss is obtained by dividing the<br>
difference in transmission loss before and after winding the<br>
optical fiber around a metal rod or the like by ten and some turns<br>
by the number of turns.<br>
As described above, the optical fiber ribbon 10. of the<br>
present invention has an advantage that the polarization mode<br>
dispersion (PMD) in a loose coil state becomes equal to or less<br>
than 0.2ps/km1/2.  Further, the optical fiber ribbon 10 of the<br><br>
present invention also has an advantage that the PMD of the optical<br>
fibers which constitute the optical fiber ribbon become 0.2ps/km1/2<br>
after the optical^ fiber ribbon is formed into a cable.  Since<br>
the sheaths 12, 12A which cover the optical fibers 11, 11A are<br>
thin and hence, the optical fiber ribbon is easily bendable.<br>
Accordingly, even when the optical fiber ribbon is formed in a<br>
loose coil state, no excessive external force is applied and the<br>
PMD can be reduced.  Since the PMD affects the long-distance<br>
transmission, the optical fiber ribbon exhibiting the small PMD<br>
can per form the long-distance transmission. It is more preferable<br>
that the polarization mode dispersion (PMD) in a loose coil state<br>
is equal to or less than 0. lps/km1/2.<br>
'On the other hand, with respect to the related-art tape<br>
ribbon structure, usually, all of the optical fibers are covered<br>
with coating of a sheath having a thickness of 25 to 4 0|utu it is considered that at the time of curing of the coating, a strain<br>
which is generated due to a stress or the like attributed to the curing shrinking remains in the optical fibers and hence, the polarization mode dispersion is increased.<br>
Here, as the method of measuring the polarization mode dispersion (PMD) after forming the optical ribbon into a cable, a reference testing method (RTM) and an alternative testing method (ATM) can be named. As the RTM, the Jones-Matrix (JME) method and the Poincare sphere (PS) method can be"named. On the other hand, astheATM, the polarized state (SOP) method, the interference<br><br>
method, a fixed analyzer (FA) method and the like can be named. The polarization mode dispersion of the optical fibers of the optical fiber ribbon is measures using the above-mentionedmethods in a loose coil state, wherein it is preferable that the maximum value is equal to or less than 0. 2ps/km1/2 and it is more preferable that the maximum value is equal to or less than 0. lps/kmI/2.<br>
Next, the method of manufacturing the optical fiber ribbon according to the present invention is explained.<br>
Fig. 7 is an explanatory view showing the method of manufacturing the optical fiber ribbon 10 according to the present invention. In the inside of a supply device 100, reels 21a to 21d, dancer_rollers 22a to 22d and a guide roller 23 are disposed. Optical fibers 11a, lib, lie, lid are respectively wound around the reels 21a, 21b, 21c, 21d. These optical fibers correspond to the optical fibers 11 which are explained in conjunction with the optical fiber ribbon shown in Fig. 1. Here, although the explanation is made with respect to an example which manufactures the optical fiber ribbon using four optical fibers, the number of the optical fibers is not limited.<br>
The optical fibers 11a, lib, lie, lid are respectively paid off from the reels 21a, 21b, 21c, 21d and a tension of ten .and some gf are applied to the optical fibers 11a, lib, lie, lid by the dancer rollers 22a, 22b, 22c, 22d. When the optical fibers 11a, lib, lie, lid pass over the guide roller 23, the optical fibers 11a, lib, lie, lid a*e arranged on one arrangement row<br><br>
surface. Further, the optical fibers 11a, lib, lie, lid are further assembled by an overhead guide roller 24 and are fed to a coating device 26. The coating device 26 includes a nipple 25 and a die 27. The optical fibers 11a to lid which are fed to the coating device 26 are guided by the nipple 25.<br>
As shown in Fig. 8, the nipple 25 has an oblong line exit opening 25a. With respect to sizes of the line exit opening 25a, it is preferable that, assuming the number of the optical fibers 11 as N (here four) , a width Wn and a thickness Tn are respectively expressed by following formulae.<br>
Wn = outer diameter of optical fiber x N + 0.03 to 0.08 mm<br>
When the optical fibers are arranged such that they are<br>
brought into contact with each other, it is preferable to set<br>
such that Wn = outer diameter of optical fiber x N + 0.03 to 0.05 mm.<br>
It is preferable to set the thickness Tn such that the thickness is expressed by the formula that Tn = outer diameter of optical fiber + 0.005 to 0.01 mm.<br>
In the coating device 2 6, a die 27 shown in Fig. 9 is disposed. The die 27 is provided with an oblong hole 27a through which four respective* optical fibers 11a, lib, lie, lid pass.<br>
It is preferable that a height H of the hole 27a of the die 27 is set such that H = outer diameter of optical fiber + 0.005 to 0.05mm. Further, a widgth Wd of the hole 27a of the die 27 is set such that Wd = H x N. Here, since the die 27 is<br><br>
exclusively manufactured by wire electric discharge machining, H becomes large than at least the wire diameter. H is approximately 0. 05 to 0. 08 at a minimum,. , Further, to prevent" the hole 27a of the die 27 from damaging the optical fibers 11 even when the optical fibers 11 are brought into contact with the hole 27a, a smooth curved shape such as R (a round shape) , for example, is imparted to peripheral portions and corner portions of the hole 27a of the die 27. The sizes of the hole 27a of the die 27. are designed corresponding to the outer diameter of the optical fiber and the thickness of the sheath. Assuming the maximum thickness of the optical fiber ribbon as T, it is possible to manufacture the optical fiber ribbon having the thickness T which takes values such as<br>
T 
temperature falls in a range of 1000Pa-s to 20000Pa-s.<br>
Four optical fibers 11a, lib, lie, lid are arranged in<br><br>
parallel on one planar face in a state that they are brought into contact with each other at a point of time that the optical fibers 11a, lib, lie, lid reach the coating device 2 6, wherein an ultraviolet ray curable resin is applied to the periphery of the optical fibers 11a, lib, lie, lid. The ultraviolet ray curable resin is supplied from a pressurized resin tank 2 8 . To four optical fibers 11a, lib, lie, lid to which the ultraviolet ray curable . resin is applied, ultraviolet rays are irradiatedby an ultraviolet ray irradiation device 29 so as to cure the ultraviolet ray curable resin. The cured ultraviolet ray curable resin forms the sheath 12 and hence, 4-fibered optical fiber ribbon 10 can be formed. The optical fiber ribbon 10 which is curedby the irradiation of the ultraviolet rays from the ultraviolet ray irradiation device 29 is fed to a winding device 33 by way of a guide'roller 30, a pay-off capstan 31, and a winding tension control dancer roller 32. In the winding device 33, the optical fiber ribbon 10 is wound around a reel 33b by way of a guide 33a. A winding tension of the whole optical fiber ribbon is set to several tens gf to several hundreds gf.<br>
As described above, according to the method of manufacturing optical fiber ribbon, four optical fibers 11a, lib, lie, lid are arranged in parallel in a state that they are brought into contact with each other, and the sheath 12 is formed on the outside of the optical fibers 11a, lib, lie, lid so as to integrate them. Since the maximum value of the thickness of the optical<br><br>
fiber ribbon can be set to a value which falls in a range from the diameter of the optical fibers to a value which is 40m larger ^than the diameter of -the optical fiber ribbon, the respective optical fibers 11 can be easily branched (live-line branching) . • The optical fiber ribbon and the manufacturing method of the same according to the present invention are not limited to the above-mentioned embodiments and proper modifications and improvements can be made.<br>
A modification of the optical fiber ribbon according to the first embodiment of the present invention is shown in Fig. 10. In an optical fiber ribbon 10A shown in Fig. 10, theneighboring. optical fibers 11A are integrally formed over the whole length" using a resin 12aA. The resin 12aA is formed such that the resin 12aA fills the indentation between the optical fibers 11A and adheres the neighboring optical fibers 11A together. Further, a maximum thickness of the optical fiber ribbon 10A is set such that the thickness does not exceed the outer diameter d of the optical fibers 11A. To this end, the maximum thickness T of the optical fiber ribbon 10A is set equal to the outer diameter d of the optical fibers 11A.<br>
Next, an optical *fiber ribbon and a manufacturing method thereof according to the second embodiment of the present invention are explained in detail in conjunction with attached drawings.<br>
Fig. 11A is a cross-sectional view showing a second embodiment of the optical fiber ribbon according to the present<br><br>
invention and Fig. 11B is a perspective view of the optical fiber<br>
ribbon.  The optical fiber ribbon 110 is formed by arranging a<br>
plurality of (four pieces as an example in this embodiment) optical<br>
fibers 111 in parallel and applying a sheath 112 over the whole<br>
outer periphery of these optical fibers 111 arranged in parallel<br>
and over the entire length of the optical fibers 111. In the<br>
optical fiber ribbon according to the present invention, as shown<br>
in Fig. 11A, the optical fibers are brought into contact with<br>
each other. Here, "brought into contact with" includes a case<br>
in which there exists an interval between neighboring optical<br>
fibers of the optical fiber ribbon of equal to or less than lOjom as a manufacturing error. To compare a case in which the optical<br>
fibers included in the optical fiber ribbon are brought into contact<br>
with each other and a case in which the optical fibers included<br>
in the optical fiber ribbon are not brought into contact with<br>
each other, the optical fiber ribbon can be easily branched when<br>
the optical fibers are brought into contact with each other * Even<br>
when the optical fibers are not brought into contact with each<br>
other, so long as the interval between the neighboring optical<br>
fibers of the optical fiber ribbon is equal to or less than 10(xm, an amount of resin which forms the sheath and intrudes between'<br>
the optical fibers is small and hence, branching can be performed easily. The optical fiber 111 is constituted of a glass fiber 113 which consists of core 113a and a clad 113b, a protective coating 14 which covers an outer periphery of the glass fiber<br><br>
13, and a color layer which covers an outer periphery 115 of the protective coating 114. Further, the outer periphery 115 may constitute a secondary protective film and the color layer having<br>
a thickness of approximately l|om to lOpm may be formed on the outer periphery 115. Further, thin film-like carbon layer may be formed on the periphery of the glass fiber 113 by coating. Here, it is preferable that the optical fiber 111 conforms to G652 prescribed in ITU-T (International Telecommunication Union - Telecommunication standardization sector).<br>
As the glass fiber 113 which can be used in the present invention, a glass fiber having any distribution of refractive index can be used including a glass fiber which is formed of a core and a multi-layered clad. Further, as the optical fiber 111, an optical fiber which is formed by covering an outer periphery ' of the glass fiber 113 with the protective coating 114 may be used.<br>
In this optical fiber ribbon 110, an ultraviolet ray curable resin is applied to the outer peripheries of four optical fibers 111 arranged in parallel as the sheath 112. As the material of the sheath 112, a thermoplastic resin, a thermosetting resin or the like can be used besides the ultraviolet ray curable resin.<br>
In the sheath 1,12 which covers the optical fibers 111, recessed portions 116 are formed in the sheath 12 in conformity with indentations formed between the neighboring optical fibers 111, 111.<br><br>
The recessed portions 116 formed in the sheath 112 are effective at the time of branching the optical fibers 111 by peeling off the sheath 112 from the optical fiber ribbon 110. At the time of performing the branching operation of the optical fibers 111, cracks or peeling-off are generated in the sheath 12 by a manual operation of an operator or a branching tool and hence, the sheath 112 can be easily peeled off.<br>
To take the achievement of the favorable branching operability and the suppression of increase of transmission loss at the time of live-line branching into consideration, it has been confirmed that in the optical fiber ribbon according to the present invention, there exists a fixed range with respect to '"the thickness of the sheath.<br>
Table 4 shows the relationship among an outer diameter d of the optical fiber, a maximum thickness T of the optical fiber ribbon, a thickness t of the sheath and a depth Y of the recessed portion of the sheath. The table is served for exhibiting the branching property, loose coil PMD and cable PMD of the optical fiber ribbon. Here, the thickness t of the sheath is a wall thickness of the sheath outside the common tangent of respective optical fibers of the optical fiber ribbon.<br><br><br><br>
In Table 4, as shown in Fig. 11A,-fiber diameter means the outer diameter d of the optical fiber 111, ribbon thickness i-s-the maximum thickness T of the optical fiber ribbon 110, and sheath thickness is a length t between the common tangent SI of the sheath 112 and the common tangent- S2 of the optical fibers 111 aftd can be obtained by a formula t = (T-d)/2. The depth of the recessed portions of the sheath is a length Y between the common tangent SI of the sheath 112 and bottoms 117 of the recessed portions 116 of the sheath 112 . The outer diameter of the optical<br>
fibers of the optical fiber ribbon shown in Table 4 is 250pm.<br>
Branching property shown in Table 4 indicates the easiness of branching-at the time of branching an intermediate portion of the optical fiber ribbon into respective optical fibers while suppressing the increase of transmission loss to 1.0 dB or less. "very good" indicates that the branching can be performed within two minutes, "good" indicates that the branching can be performed in a time exceeding two minutes and within three minutes, and "fair" indicates that the branching can be performed in'a time exceeding three minutes and within 5 minutes. The fact that the increase of the transmission loss at the time of branching is equai to or less than 1. OdB means that the live-line branching can be performed.<br>
The optical fiber ribbon shown in Table 4 exhibits the<br>
relationship T 
 <br>
intermediate post blanching can be performed within five minutes by setting the increase of the transmission loss at the time of branching to equal to or less than 1.0dB.~ -That is, the live line branching can be performed within 5 minutes. With respect to the related-art optical fiber ribbon, the increment of the transmission loss at the time of branching exceeds 1. OdB or the related-art optical fiber ribbon requires a given time which exceeds five minutes even when the optical fibers can be separated and hence, the live-line branching cannot be performed from a realistic point of view.<br>
With respect to the above-mentioned live-line branching, one example of the branching method is explained. --As shown in Fig. 12A,~-the optical fiber ribbon 110 is sandwiched between an upper base 161 and a lower base 162 of a branching tool 160, wherein wire rods 163 which are formed on these upper and lower bases 161, 162 in an erected manner are made to approach the sheath 112 of the optical fiber ribbon 110. Fig. 12B shows the cross section of such a structure. Further, by pressing the branching tool 160 to the optical fiber ribbon 110, as shown in Fig. 12C, the wire rods 163 are deflected and sharp corners of distal ends of the deflected wire rods 163 are strongly brought into contact with the sheath 112 of the optical fiber ribbon 110.<br>
By moving the branching tool 160 relative to the optical fiber ribbon 110 in the longitudinal direction (the left-and-right direction in Fig. 12C) of the optical fiber ribbon 110 in a state<br><br>
that the branching tool 160 is pressed to the optical fiber ribbon 110, that is, by rubbing the optical fiber ribbon 110 with the branching tool 160, flaws are formed on the sheath 112 qr^the sheath 12 is peeled off by the distal ends of the wire rods 63 and hence, the optical fibers 111 are branched. Either one or both of the branching tool 160 and the optical fiber ribbon 110 may be moved. The wire rods 163 are resilient and hence, when the wire rods 163 are pressed to the sheath 12 of the optical fiber ribbon 110, the wire rpds 163 are deflected and the corner portions of the distal ends of the wire rods 163 are brought into contact with the sheath 112. By moving the branching tool 160 or the optical fiber ribbon 110 in such a state, the wire rods 163 (flexible member) impart flaws to the sheath 1"12 or peel off the sheath 112. By repeating rubbing of- the optical fiber ribbon 110 using the branching tool 160, an interface between the color layer 115 of the optical fiber 111 and the sheath 112 is peeled off. When the rubbing is further repeated, portions of the sheath 12 above or below the center axes of the optical fiber 11 are shaved off and cracks are generated and thereafter, the cracks are developed to the recessed portions 116 of the sheath 112 by the stress concentration and hence, the sheath 112 are peeled off. In this manner, the sheath 112 of the optical fiber ribbon 110 is ruptured and the optical fiber ribbon 110 is branched into the respective optical fibers.<br>
By adjusting the power by which the resilient materials<br><br>
163 is pressed to the optical fiber ribbon 110, a change amount of transmission loss of optical signals at the time of branching becomes equal to or less than 1.0. Further, depending on the manner of branching, such a change amount of transmission loss can be reduced to a value equal to or less than 0.5dB. Accordingly, even when the optical fiber ribbon includes live lines, the optical fiber ribbon can be branched without cutting the live lines even in a moment.<br>
To review the branching property of tht optical fiber ribbons shown in Fig. 4, the smaller the thickness of the sheath, it is possible to have the better branching property even when the depth of the recessed portions of the sheath is small. Although in case the thickness t of the sheath is 20nm, when the depth Y of the recessed portions of the sheath is 20(om, the evaluation of the branching property is "very good". On the other hand,<br>
in case the thickness of the sheath t is equal to or less than 15 )im, when the depth Y of the recessed portions of the sheath is equal to or more than 5|im, the evaluation of the branching property is "very good" . Accordingly, provided that the thickness<br>
t of the sheath is equal to or less than 15 |jjn, even when the depth of the -recessed portions of the sheath 12 is shallow, it<br>
is possible to obtain the extremely favorable branching property. In other words, when the maximum thickness T of the optical fiber<br>
ribbon is T 
 <br>
property.<br>
When the ribbon thickness is 2901am, provided that the value of the ratio (T-d)/2Y between the sheath thickness-( (T-d)/2 and the depth of the recessed portion Y of the sheath is equal to or less than 4, the evaluation of the branching property becomes "very good" or "good" and hence, the branching property can be enhanced.<br>
In the same manner, the evaluation of the loose coil PMD and the cable PMD is examined. The loose coil PMD is the polarized mode dispersion in a state that the optical fiber ribbons are loosely coiled in a circular shape and the cable PMD is the polarized mode dispersion when the optical fiber ribbons are formed into a cable. With respect to the evaluation of the loose coil PMD and the cable PMD, the symbol "very good" shows a case in which they assume a value 0.05 (ps/km1/2) or less, "good" shows a case in which the polarization mode dispersion assumes a value 0.05<pmd and the symbol shows a case in which the.polarization mode dispersion assumes a. value . with respect to loose coil pmd when ratio between sheath thickness depth of recessed portions is or less evaluation good hence favorable. contrary larger than ribbon></pmd>
thickness is 290|im. In the cable PMD, provided that the difference between the ribbon thickness and the optical fiber diameter is<br><br>
30|xm or more, the evaluation is "good" when the (T-d)/2Y is 1 or less, and the evaluation is "fair" when the (T-d)/2Y is larger than 1. When the difference between the ribbon thickness and<br>
the diameter of the optical fibers is 20|im or less, the evaluation is "good".<br>
Although not shown in Table 4, with respect to the optical fiber ribbon having the thickness of more than 290^tm, that is, the optical fiber ribbon having the thickness exceeding d+40 (|im), it is possible to favorably ensure the integrality of the optical fiber ribbon. However, this takes a long time at the time of performing thebranchingandhence, it is favorable that the maximum thickness of the optical fiber ribbon is made equal to or less than d+40|om. In this case, it is favorable that the thickness t of the sheath is equal to or less than 20pm. This implies that it is favorable that, in Fig. 11A, the thickness t of the portion of the sheath above the optical fibers and the thickness t of the sheath below the optical fibers are substantially equal. In this case, the cores 113a of the optical fibers 111 are positioned almost at the center in the thickness direction of the optical fiber ribbon 110 and hence, when the optical fiber ribbons are connected to each other, the positions of the cores of both optical fiber ribbons are substantially aligned with each other whereby the connection loss is small.<br>
Next, the evaluation of the branching property when the ribbon thickness of the optical fiber ribbon is 280 (|xm), 270 (pm) ,<br><br>
2 60 (jam) . In all cases in which the ribbon thickness of the optical fiber ribbon is 280 {\xm) , 270 (jjru) and 260 (\m) , so long as the ratio (T-d) /2Y between the sheath thickness and the depth of the recessed portion of the sheath is 4 or less, the evaluation is "good" or "very good" and hence, the branching property is favorable.<br><br><br><br>
Table 5 shows the relationship among the outer diameter d of optical fibers of the optical fiber ribbon using optical<br>
fibers having an outer diameter of 125|im, the maximum thickness T of the optical fiber ribbon, the thickness t of the sheath and the depth Y of the recessedportions in the sheath. The explanation of the thickness of the sheath, the depth of the recessed portions of the sheath, the branching property of the optical fiber ribbon, the loose coil PMD and the cable PMD and the explanation of the symbol "very good", the symbol " good" and the symbol "fair" of the evaluation are similar to those explained in conjunction with Table 4 and hence, these explanations are omitted here.<br>
When the ribbon thickness is 165|im, tfie relationship T 
can be performed.<br>
Although not shown in Table 5, with respect to the optical<br>
fiber ribbon having the ribbon thickness exceeding 165pm, that is, the fiber diameter of equal to or more than d+40pm, the time necessary for performing the branching without increasing the loss of the optical fibers is prolonged (for example, it takes more than 5 minutes) and hence, it is favorable that the ribbon<br>
thickness T is equal to or less than the fiber diameter d+40jim. Accordingly, it is favorable that the thickness t of the sheath<br>
is equal to or less than 20|im in the same manner as Table 4. To review the sheath thickness t and the deoth Y of thp<br><br>
recessed portions of the sheath with respect to the branching property of the optical fiber ribbons shown in Table 5, the smaller the thickness t of the sheath, -even when the depth Y of the recessed portions of the sheath is made shallow, it is possible to obtain the extremely favorable branching property. The evaluation of the branching property becomes "very good" in case that the depth Y of the recessed portions of the sheath is 20fim when the thickness of the sheath wall t is 20|im and in case that the depth Y of the recessed portions of the sheath is equal to or more than 5pm when the thickness of the sheath wall tis 15fim. Accordingly, by setting the thickness t of the sheath to 15jjm or less, that is, as long<br>
as the relationship T^ fiber outer diameter d+ 30|imis established, -■■ the branching operation can be performed within a short time even when the recessed portions of the sheath is shallow.<br>
In Table 5, when the thickness of the sheath wall t is<br>
equal to ore less than 15jjm, provided that the ratio (T-d) /2Y is 4 or less, the evaluation of the branching property is "very good' and this implies that the branching operation canbe performed in a short period.<br>
Fig. 13A is a cross-sectional view of another optical fiber ribbon according-to-the second err^odiment^f t-hepresentrinv^irbion and Fig. 13B is a perspective view of the optical fiber ribbon. The basic structure of the optical fiber ribbon 110A is substantially equal to the basic structure~of the optical fiber ribbon 110 shown in Fig. 11A and hence, the explanation of the<br><br>
constitutions which are common between them is not made.<br>
A sheath 112A which covers outer peripheries of the optical fibers lllAhas a recessed shape in conformity with the indentations formed by the neighboring optical fibers 111A, 111A. The recessed portions 116A of the sheath has a deeper recessed shape compared to the case shown in Fig. 11A.<br>
The prevention of separation of the optical fiber at the time of manufacturing the optical fiber ribbon by arranging a plurality of optical fibers in parallel and by integrating them using a sheath, the prevention of peeling-off (becomes a cause . of separation of the optical fibers) at the time of performing the installation operation of the optical fiber ribbon, or the increase or decrease of transmission loss during the favorable branching operation or the live-line branching are reviewed. As a result, it is preferable that the recessed portions 116A are formed such that the recessed portions 116A do not exceed a common tangent S2A which is formed by the neighboring optical fibers 111A, 111A. That is, it is favorable that the recessed portions 116A are formed at the inner side than the common tangent S2A.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
Table 6 shows the relationship among the fiber diameter d, the ribbon thickness T, the sheath thickness t, the depth Y of the recessed portions of the sheath and the ribbon thickness g at the recessed portions shown in Fig. 13A and indicates the branching properties, the loose coil PMD and the cable PMD of the optical fiber ribbons . The evaluations "very good" and "good" on the branching property, the loose coil PMD and the cable PMD in Table 6 are substantially equal to those used in the evaluations in Table 4 and hence, their explanation is omitted.<br>
The distance between the common tangents S2A, S2A of the neighboring optical fibers 111A, 111A can be set as the outer diameter d of the optical fiber, wherein provided that the ratio g/d shown in Table 6 is equal to or less than 1.0, the recessed portions 116A formed in the sheath 112 do not exceed the common tangent S2A of the optical fiber. As shown in Fig. 13A which is a cross-sectional view, the recessed portion 116A is positioned inside (center axis directions of optical fibers) of the common tangents S2A, S2A of the optical fibers 11A.<br>
The optical fiber ribbons shown in Table 6 exhibit the<br>
ratio g/d 
of branching properties, all optical fiber ribbons exhibit the<br>
evaluation "very good" .  In this case, since the recessed portion<br>
116A of the sheath 112A is deeply formed along the indentation<br>
formed by the optical fibers 111A, 111A, the thickness of the<br><br>
recessed portions 116A of the sheath 112A can be reduced whereby the optical fibers 111A can be branched more easily.<br>
To review.the evaluation of the loose coil PMD, all of optical fiber ribbons exhibit "very good" and hence, the loose coil PMD is extremely favorable- With respect to these optical fibers, since the sheath at the recessed portions 116A is made thin not to exceed the common tangent, the optical fibers are easily bendable in the longitudinal direction and the recessed portions are deep. On the other hand, as shown in Fig. 14, the optical fibers are easily deflectable in the widthwise direction and hence, when the optical fiber ribbon 110A is formed in a loose coil state, no excessive force is applied to the optical fiber ribbon whereby it is considered that the loose coil PMD can be enhanced. Further, the sheath 112A of the optical fiber ribbon 11OA approximates a circular shape along the outer peripheries of the optical fibers 111A and hence, the anisotropy of the curing shrinking stress of the sheath which may occur in manufacturing the optical fiber ribbon can be reduced whereby it is considered that the PMD of the optical fiber ribbon- in a loose coil state can be enhanced.<br>
To review the evaluation of the cabled PMD, when the ratio g/d is equal to or less than 0.8, the cabled PMD becomes a value which is below 0. 5 (ps/km1/2) and hence, the extremely favorable cabled PMD characteristics are obtained. When the ratio g/d is equal to or less than 0.8, with respect to the sheath 112A of<br><br>
the optical fiber ribbon 110A, the sheath at the recessed portions 116Acanbemade extremely thin andhence, the optical fiber ribbons 110A are easily bendable in the longitudinal direction-along the groove shape of the slots and the in the widthwise direction. Accordingly, even when the optical fiber ribbon is twisted when the optical fiber ribbon is formed into a cable, the optical fiber ribbon is bended so that the stress attributed to twisting can be released whereby it is considered that the cabled PMS can be enhanced.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
Table 7 shows the relationship among the fiber diameter d, the ribbon thickness T, the sheath thickness t, the depth Y of the recessed portions of the sheath and the ribbon thickness g at the recessed portions of the optical fiber ribbon using the<br>
optical fibers having the outer diameter of 125JJHU The explanation of the sheath thickness, the depth of the recessed portions of<br>
the sheath, the branching properties of the optical fiber ribbon, the loose coil PMD and the cable PMD and the explanation of the evaluations "very good", "good" and "fair" are substantially equal to those used in Table 4 and hence, their explanation is omitted. In any one of optical, fiber ribbons having the sheath<br>
thickness of 20 (pm), 15(|im), 10 (|im). and 5 (|jm), provided that the ratio g/d is equal to or less than 1.0, the evaluations of the branching property and the loose coil PMD become "very good", while provided that the ratio g/d is equal to or less than 0.8, the evaluation of the cable PMD also becomes "very good". The factors which bring about such evaluations are equal to those factors shown in Table 6.<br>
Although not shown in Table. 7, with respect to the optical fiber ribbon having the ribbon thickness exceeding 165|om, that is, the fiber diameter d of equal to or more than d+40|airi, the time necessary for performing the branching without increasing the loss of the optical fibers is prolonged (for example, it takes more than 5 minutes) and hence, it is favorable that the ribbon thickness T is equal to or less than the fiber diameter d+40|im.<br><br><br>
Table 8 shows a table indicating the relationship between the thickness g of the optical fiber ribbon at the recessed portion 116A and the branching property and the cabling (integrity) when<br>
the outer diameter d of the optical fibers is 250|im in an optical fiber ribbon similar to the optical fiber ribbon shown in Fig. 13A. The cabled "good" in the table indicates that although the optical fiber ribbon is twisted when the optical fibers are cabled by assembling the optical fibers, the optical fiber ribbon is not separated intB respective optical fibers due to the twisted stress. The evaluation of the branching property is performed in the same manner as Tables 4 to 1. As shown in Table, when the thickness-g of the optical fiber ribbon at the recessed portion<br>
116A is 80fom to 20.0ym, both of the branching property and the ribbon forming are favorable. Here/ from a viewpoint of ribbon<br>
forming, it is preferable to ensure 40)am or more as the thickness g of the optical fiber ribbon.<br>
As shown in Fig. 11A and Fig. 13A, in the optical fiber ribbon according to the present invention, it is desirable that the recessed portions of the sheath are formed in a smooth curved shape R. This is because when the recessed portions 116A of the sheath 112A have acute distal ends thereof along the shape of the optical fiber ribbon, a stress is concentrated on the distal<br><br>
ends of the recessed portions and hence, ruptures and cracks are liable to be easily generated.<br>
Further, in the optical fiber ribbon according to the present invention, the adhesive strength between the optical fiber and the sheath sometimes affects the increase of the transmission loss and the live-line operation efficiency at the time of performing the live-line branching. With respect to the adhesive strength of the optical fibers 111, 111A and the sheath 112, 112A, to take the prevention of the increase of the transmission loss and the branching operability into consideration, it is favorable that the adhesive strength per one optical fiber falls within a range of 0.245(mN) to 2.45(mN). When the' above-mentioned adhesive strength is smaller than the above-mentioned range, there may arise a case that the sheath 112, 112A is ruptured at the time of being formed into a cable and the optical fibers 111, 111A are separated from each other. On the other hand, when the adhesive strength is larger than the above-mentioned range, the branching property is deteriorated.<br>
The adhesive strength between the optical fiber and the sheath is measured by the above-mentioned method explained in conjunction with Fig. 5 and Fig. 6. s<br>
In the optical fiber ribbon 110, 110A according to the present invention, when a main object of the invention lies in that the optical fibers 111, 111A keep the integrity without being separated from each other, it is favorable that the thickness<br><br>
of the sheath 112, 112A is equal to or more than ljjun. In this case, the maximum thickness T of the optical fiber ribbon 110,<br>
110A becomes T&gt; outer diameter of the optical fiber .d+1 (pm) .<br>
Also depending on the properties of the sheath 112, 112A of- the optical fiber ribbon 110, 110A, in some cases, these properties affect the increase of the transmission loss and the branching operation efficiency at the live-line branching. It is preferable that the yield point stress, as the property of material of the sheath, falls within a range of 20MPa to 45Mpa. This is because that the branching operation can be performed easily and the transmission loss at the time of performing the live-line branching can be suppressed. When the yield point stress is less than 20MPa, the respective"optical fibers are separated from each other due to an external force applied in a step for forming a cable by assembling the optical fiber ribbon and hence, there maybe a case that the cabling cannot be performed. On the other hand, when the yield point stress exceeds 40MPa, it is difficult to rupture the sheath and hence, it is difficult to perform the intermediate post blanching of the optical fiber ribbon.<br>
The branching property and the integrity of the optical fiber ribbon according to the present invention are also related with the physical properties of the sheath. For example, with respect to the sheath 112, 112Ahaving the large Young's modulus, even when the thickness g of the optical fiber ribbon 110, 110A<br><br>
at the recessed portion lie, 116A is smaller or the thickness t of the sheath is small, it is possible to ensure a sufficient constraining force to integrate the optical fibers. From a viewpoint of branching property, v:hen the Young' s modulus is large, it is preferable to reduce the thickness g of the optical fiber ribbon 110, 110A or the thickness t of the sheath at the recessed portions 116, 116A.<br>
According to the experiment, it is understood that, when the Young's modulus of the sheath 112, 112A exceeds lOOOMPa, provided that the thickness g of the optical fiber ribbon 110,<br>
110A at the recessed portions 116, 116A is 40[im or more, the sheath 112, 112A is too*-hard and hence, the branching property of the optical fiber 111, 111A is deteriorated. On the other hand, it is found that when the Young's modulus of the sheath 112,112A becomes equal to or less than ICOMPa, the sheath 12 is too soft and is broken during a next step of manufacturing of cables unless the thickness g of the optical fiber ribbon at the recessed portion<br>
lie, 116A is set to 2 0 0^m or more and hence, the integrated state cannot be maintained. Accordingly, it is favorable that the Young's modulus of the sheath 112, 112A is set to equal to or less than lOOOMPa. It is, however, preferable to set the Young's modulus of the sheath 112- 112A to more than lOOMPa.<br>
Further, the branching art: integration relate also to the rupture elongation of the resin vrhich forms the sheath 112, 112A. When the elongation is equal to or less than 35%, the optical<br><br>
fibers ill, 111A can he easily branched.  However, when the<br>
elongation is equal to cr less than 10%, the optical fibers are cracked during the next process of manufacturing the cable and hence, the integration state cannot be maintained. Accordingly, it is favorable that the rupture elongation is equal to or less<br>
than 35% and equal to cr -ore than 10%.<br>
To prepare the blending of the ultraviolet ray curable resin having the above-mentioned Young's modulus, the Young's modulus can be increased by reducing a molecular weight of the oligomer or by increasing an addition amount of bifunctional monomer such as ethylene oxide modified bisphenol A diacrylate or the like.<br>
Further," in performing the blending of the resin to make the resin have the above-rentioned rupture elongation, it is possible to increase the rupture elongation by increasing a molecular weight in diol in the oligomer molecules such as PTMG or the like cr by reducing an addition amount of bifunctional monomer such as ethylene oxide modified bisphenol A diacrylate or the like.<br>
Even when such conditions are satisfied, when the transmission less at the time of branching the optical fibers 111, lllAis 1 ar.ee, the optical fibers are not suitable as a product. That is, when the increase :f the transmission loss at the time of branching becomes larger than I.OdB, there is a possibility that the communication is interrupted. Accordingly, the optical<br><br>
fiber ribbon whose increase of transmission loss at the time of branching is equal to or less than 1. OdB is the optical fiber ribbon which can be served for live-line branching and hence is preferable. It is more preferable that the transmission loss at the time of branching is equal to or less than 0.5dB.<br>
Here, the measurement of the yieldpoint stress, the Young's modulus and the tensile rupture elongation and the measurement of the transmission loss at the time of branching the optical fibers 111, 111A are performed in the same manner as the measurements explained in conjunction with the above-mentioned optical fiber ribbon of the first embodiment.<br>
It is favorable that the mode field diameter according to the definition of Petermann-I at the wavelength of l'.55|am of the optical fiber 111, 111.-, is equal to or less than 10|iin. At the same time, it is favorable that the cable cut-off wavelength of the class fiber 113, 113A of the optical fiber 111, 111A is<br>
equal tc or less than 1.2 cum. The cable cut-off wavelength indicates a cut-off wavelength of LPia mode at 22m length and is a value smaller than a 2m cut-off 'wavelength.<br>
Further, with respect to the glass fiber 113, 113A of the optical fiber 111, 111A, the macrcbend loss at the bending diameter<br>
of 15mm. at a "wavelength of 1.55um is set to a value equal to or less than O.ldB/tum.  The macrobend loss is obtained by dividing<br>
the difference in transmission less before and after winding the<br>
optical fiber around a metal rod or the like by ten and some turns<br><br>
bv the number of turns.<br>
As described above, "he optical fiber ribbon 110, 110A of the present invention has an advantage that the polarization mode dispersion (PKD) in a loose coil state becomes equal to or less than 0 .2ps/knr/z. Further, the optical fiber ribbon 10 of the present invention also has an advantage that the PMD of the optical fiber which constitutes the optical fiber ribbon becomes 0.2ps/km1/2 after the optical fibers 111, 111A are formed into a cable. Since the sheaths 112, 112A which cover the optical fibers 111, 111A are thin and hence, the optical fiber ribbon is easily bendable. Due to the presence of the recessed portions 116, 116A, the optical fiber- ribbon is easily bendable in the widthwise direction and the anisotropy of the curing shrinking stress of the sheath is also small. Accordingly, even when the optical fiber ribbon is formed in a loose coil state, no excessive external force is applied and the PMD can be reduced. Since the PMD affects the long-distance transmission, the optical fiber ribbon exhibiting the small PMD can perform the long-distance transmission.<br>
On the other hand, with respect to the related-art ribbon structure, it is considered that, usually, all of the optical fibers are covered with coating cf a sheath having a thickness<br>
of 25 to 4 0{im. It is considered that at the time of curing of the coating, a strain which is generated due to a stress or the like attributed to the curing shrinking remains in the optical<br><br>
libers and hence, the polarization mode dispersion is increased.<br>
Here, as the methec of measuring the polarization mode dispersion (PMD) after forming the optical ribbon into £ cable, a reference testing method ;?.TM) and an alternative testing method (ATM) can be named. As the RTM, the Jones-Matrix (JME) method and the Poincare sphere (P£; method can be named. On the other hand, as the ATM, thepolarizedstate (SOP) method, the interference method, a fixed analyzer (FA) method and the like can be named. The polarization mode dispersion of the optical fibers of the optical fiber ribbon is measured in a loose coil state using the above-mentionedmethods, wherein it is preferable that the maximum value is equal to or less than 0. 2ps/km1/2.<br>
Next, the method of manufacturing the optical fiber ribbon according to the present invention is explained.<br>
Fig. 15 is an explanatory view showing the method of manufacturing the optical fiber ribbon 110, 110A according to the present invention. In the inside of a supply device 100, reels 121a to 121d, dancer rollers 122a to 122d and a guide roller 123 are disposed. Optical fibers Ilia, 111b, 111c, 11Id are respectively wound around the reels 221a, 121b, 121c, 121d. These optical fibers correspond to the optical fibers 111,111A which are explained in conjunction with the optical fiber ribbon shown in Fig. I1A and Fig. 13A. Here, although the explanation is made with respect to an example which manufactures the optical fiber ribbon using four optical fibers, the number of the optical fibers<br><br>
is not limited to 4.<br>
The optical fibers 11 la, 111b, 111c, llld are respectively paid off from the reels 121a, 121b, 121c, 121d and a tension of ten and some gf are applied to the optical fibers Ilia, 111b, 111c, llld by the dancer rollers 122a, 122b, 122c, 122d. When the optical fibers Ilia, 111b, 111c, llld pass over the guide roller 123, the optical fibers Ilia, 111b, 111c, llld are arranged on one arrangement row surface . Further, the optical fibers Ilia, 111b, 111c, llld are further assembled by an overhead guide roller 124 and are fed to a coating device 126. The coating device 126 includes a nipple 125 and a die 127. The optical fibers Ilia "to llld which are fed to the coating device 126 are guided by the nipple 125 and are set to a desired arrangement.<br>
As shown in Fig. 16, the nipple 125 has an oblong line exit opening 125a. With respect to sizes of the line exit opening 125a, it is preferable that, assuming the number of the optical fibers 111, 111A as N (here, four), a width Wn and a thickness Tn are respectively expressed by following formulae.<br>
Wn = outer diameter cf optical fiber x N + 0.03 to 0.08 mm<br>
When the optical fibers are arranged such that they are<br>
brought into contact with each ether, it is preferable to set<br>
such that Wn = outer diameter of optical fiber x N+ 0.03 to 0.05 mm.<br>
It is preferable to set the thickness Tn such that the<br><br>
thickness Tn is expressed by the formula Tn = outer diameter cf optical fiber + C. 00 5 to 1 . 01 irirr,.<br>
In the coating devic-e-126, a die 127 shown in Fig. 17 is disposed. The die 127 is provided with an elongated hole 127a in a contactingmanner through which four respective optical fibers Ilia, 111b, 111c, llld pass.<br>
It is preferable that a diameter Dd of the hole 127a of the die 127 is set such that Dd = outer diameter of optical fiber + 0.005 to 0.05mm.  Further, a width Wd of the hole 27a of the<br>
die 27 is set such that Wd = Dd x N. A projecting portion 127b formed between the neighboring optical fibers 111, 111A corresponds to the recessed portion 116 in Fig. llAand the recessed portion 116A in Fig. 13A. It is preferable that a distal end of the projecting portion 12^o is set such that a formula (T-d) /2/Y<br>
127b is always positioned inside the common tangent S2A of the<br>
neighboring optical fibers 111A. To be more specific, a distance Ld between distal ends of the proj ecting portions 12 7b corresponds to the thickness g of the optical fiber ribbon at the recessed portion cf the sheath. The distance Ld is set based on the design of the thickness g of the optical fiber ribbon at the recessed<br>
portions of the sheath such as a value equal to or less than 200fim, a value equal to or less than 1.0c, a value equal to or less than 0.6c (outer diameter of optical fiber - 0.05mm)or the like.<br>
Here, since the die 127 is exclusively manufactured by<br><br>
wire electric discharge machining, the distance Ld becomes larger than at least the v:ire diameter. The distance Ld is approximately 0 . 05 to 0 . 08 mm even at a minimum. Further, to prevent the distal ends of the projecting portions 127b from damaging the optical fibers 111 even when the optical fibers 111 are brought into contact with the pro jec ting port ions 12 7b, the distal ends of the projecting portions 127b are formed in a smooth curved shape such as R (a round shape) , for example. When the distal ends of the projecting portions 127b are formed in a projecting arcuate shape toward the inside of the ribbon, the radius of curvature R is preferably approximately 0.02 to 0.05mm.<br>
Four optical fibers Ilia, 111b, 111c, 11ld are arranged in parallel on one planar face in a "state that they are brought into contact with each other at a point of time that the optical fibers Ilia, 111b, 111c, 11 Id reach the coating device 12 6, wherein an ultraviolet ray curable resin is applied to the periphery of the optical fibers Ilia, 111b, 111c, llld. The ultraviolet ray curable resin is supplied from a pressurized resin tank 128. To four optical fibers Ilia, 111b, 111c, llld to which the ultraviolet ray curable resin is applied, ultraviolet rays are irradiated by an ultraviolet ray irradiation device 129 so as to cure the ultraviolet ray curable resin . The cured ultraviolet ray curable resin forms the sheath 112, 112A and hence, 4-fibered optical fiber ribbon 110,110A are formed.<br>
The optical fiber ribbon 110 which is cured by the<br><br>
irradiation of the ultraviolet rays from the ultraviolet ray irradiation device 129 is f^d to a winding device 133 by way of - -a guide roller 130, a pay-cff capstan 131, and a winding tension control dancer roller 132. In the winding device 133, the optical fiber ribbon 110, 110A is wound around a reel 133b by way of a guide 133a. Here, a winding tension of the whole optical fiber ribbon is set to ten and some gf to several hundreds gf.<br>
As  described  above,  according  to  the  method  of manufacturing optical fiber ribbon, four optical fibers Ilia, 111b, 111c, llld are arranged in parallel in a state that they are brought into contact with each other, and the sheath 112, 112A is formed on the outside of the optical fibers Ilia, 111b, 111c, llld to integrate the optical fibers. The recessed portion 116, 116A is formed between the neighboring optical fibers 111, 111A.  Since the maximum value of the thickness of the optical fiber ribbon can be set to a value which falls in a range from the diameter of the optical fibers to a value which is 40m larger than the diameter of the optical fiber ribbon, the respective optical fibers 111 can be easily branched (live-line branching) . When the optical fiber ribbon ilC, 1I0A satisfies the related<br>
formula (T-d)/2/Y 
Here, in the above-mentioned method of manufacturing the<br><br>
optical fiber ribbon, the explanation is made with respect to a case in which four optical fibers Ilia, 111b, 111c, Hid are arranged in parallel and the outer sheath 112, 112A is integrally formed on the outside of these optical fibers. Besides such a constitution, it may be possible that an ultraviolet ray curable resin is separately applied to four optical fibers Ilia, 111b, 111c, llldrespectively and, thereafter, four optical fibers Ilia, 111b, 111c, Hid are arranged close to each other and, then, the sheath 112, 112A is cured.<br>
That is, as shown in Fig. 18, four optical fibers Ilia, 111b, 111c, Hid are made to pass through a coating device 126. The coating device 126 uses a die 140 shown in Fig. 19. In the die 14 0", exit openings 14 0a are arranged separately and the ultraviolet ray curable resin is applied to respective optical fibers Ilia, 111b, 111c, Hid separately. Thereafter, using a guide roller 141 for assembling which is provided at the downstream of an ultraviolet ray irradiating device 129, four optical fibers Ilia, 111b, 111c, Hid are arranged in a row close to each other in the inside of the ultraviolet ray irradiation device 129 and they are integrally formed by the irradiation of the ultraviolet rays. Here, the resin between the neighboring optical fibers is extruded to the peripheries of the optical fibers so that the optical fibers are brought into contact with each other. By adjusting an amount of resin to be applied to the respective optical fibers, the recessed portions 116, 116A are formed between the<br><br>
neighboring optical fibers 111, 111A and, thereafter, the resin is cured.<br>
With respect to ether constitutions, since they are in common with the constitutions which are explained in conjunction with Fig. 15 and hence, parts which are served in common are given same symbols and their explanation is omitted.<br>
Also in the method of manufacturing the optical fiber ribbon, in the same manner as the above-mentioned case, the optical fiber ribbon 110, 110A is configured such that the respective optical fibers 111, 111A can be easily branched. Further, they exhibit the small PMD.<br>
Here, the optical fiber ribbon and the manufacturing method thereof according to the present invention are not limited to those in the previously-mentioned embodiments and can be suitably modified and improved. (Experiments)<br>
Hereinafter, several specific experiments of the optical fiber ribbon having the constitution shown in Fig. 13Aare explained hereinafter .  Using four optical fibers each of which has an outer<br>
diameter cf 2 50|im and includes a protective coating 114A and a<br>
■■ ■ ccior-layer*-ii5A-as -the-optic ai~~£ lire r-s-444A&gt;^	- ■ ■<br>
ribbon I10A is manufactured- As the ribbon material, an ultraviolet ray curable resin is used. As the ultraviolet ray curable resin, for example, a resin which uses, as a base, urethane acrylate-based  oligomer  which  is  a  copolymer  of  PTMG<br><br>
(polytetramethylene glycol', , TDI (tolylene diisocyanate) and HEA (hydrcxyl ethylacrylate) is used. As a diluting monomer for resin of the ribbon material, a resin to which N-vinyl-pyrrolidone, ethylene oxide modified bisphenol A diacrylate and Irugacure 184 as a light start material are added is used. The Young' s modulus and the elongation are changed by changing the resin and method for blending the resin.<br>
The used nipple 125 is formed into a shape having a width Wn of 1.04mm, a thickness Tn of 0.260mm by machining. The die 127 is formed into a shape in which a hole diameter Dd is 0 ,260mm, a width Wd is 1. 04mm, a distance Ld is 0. 08 to 0 .20mm, anda thickness g of the optical fiber ribbon at the recessed portions 116A assumes a given value by machining.<br>
Table 9 shows the results of the first to the eleventh experiments which satisfy the above-mentioned various conditions . Here, the manufacturing method of the first to the tenth experiments adopts, as explained in conjunction with Table 4, the method in which four optical fibers Ilia, 111b, 111c, 11Id are arranged close to each other in parallel, a resin is collectively applied to these optical fibers in this state so as to integrate the optical fibers . On the other hand, the eleventh experiment adopts a method in which, as explained in conjunction with Fig. 18, a resin is applied to respective four optical fibers Ilia, 111b, 111c, llld and, thereafter, the optical fibers are assembledtobe integrated.<br><br><br><br>
As shown in Table 9, it is understood that. in all experiments, it is possible to obtain the favorable result with respect to both of the branching property and the integrity at the time of forming cables.<br>
Further, in the first experiment, when the PMD of the optical fiber is measured after formation of the cable, the PMD is 0.04ps/km1/2.<br>
Here, in the first experiment to the ninth experiment, the optical fibers in which the mode field diameter at the wavelength of 1.55|xm is 9.8|im and the cable cutoff wavelength is 1.2pm are used. In the tenth experiment, optical fibers which h'&amp;s a mode field diameter of 7.6pm at a wavelength of 1.55pm and a cable cutoff wavelength of 1.2pm are used. In this case, it is understood that the transmission loss at the time of branching can be further reduced.<br>
Next, the optical fiber cables using the optical fiber ribbon according to the present invention are explained in conjunction with Fig. 20 to Fig. 38.<br>
First of all, the optical fiber cable according to the first embodiment of the present invention is explained in conjunction with Fig. 20 to Fig; 25.<br>
As shown in Fig. 20, in the optical fiber cable 201 of this embodiment, a plurality of optical fiber ribbons 210 are housed in grooves 204 formed in a spacer "203 having a tensile strength body 202 at the center thereof. The optical fiber cable<br><br>
201 is a 200-core type optical fiber cable, wherein five sheets of four-fibered optical fiber ribbons 210 are stacked and housed in each one of ten grooves -204. Further, ten grooves 204 are formed spirally in the airernatingly inverted manner in the circumferential direction while maintaining a state in which they are arranged parallel to each other in the longitudinal direction. That is, the spacer 203 is an SZ spacer. Further, the twisting pitch of the grooves 204 is 500mm. Here, an outer diameter of the spacer 203 is, for example, 12mm.<br>
Further, to prevent the removal of the optical fiber ribbons 210 from the grooves 204, a press winding 205 is wound around a periphery of the spacer 203 and, at the*same time, on an outside of the press winding205, a sheath 206made of plastic (for example, polyethylene) is formed. An outer diameter of the sheath 206 is, for example, 16mm.<br>
Further, the tensile strength body 202 is a tensile strength body which is provided for preventing the direct transfer of a tensile strength to the optical fiber ribbons 210 when the tensile strength is applied to the optical fiber cable 201 and a steel wire is used as the tensile strength body 202.<br>
Since the optical fiber cable 201 has the direction that the grooves 204 are twisted periodically inverted and hence, it is possible to easily take out the optical fiber ribbon 210 from an inverted portion of the groove 204 by removing an arbitrary portion of the sheath 620 and the press winding 205. Accordingly,<br><br>
the optical fiber cable 201 using the SZ spacer is the structure suitable for the intermediate post branching.<br>
Here, the mode of the optical fiber ribbon 210 housed in the groove 204 is explained.<br>
As the optical fiber ribbon 210, for example, the optical fiber ribbon 10 shown in Fig. 1A can be used. That is, the optical fiber ribbon 210 is, as shown in Fig. 1A, configured such that a plurality of (four in this embodiment, for example) optical fibers 11 are arranged in parallel and a sheath 12 made of a resin integrally covers the whole outer peripheries of the optical fibers 11 arranged in parallel over the entire length of the optical fibers 11.<br>
Further, since the optical fiBer ribbon 210 covers the optical fibers 11 with the sheath 12 made of resin over the entire length of the optical fibers 11, the optical fiber ribbon 210 provides the structure which enables the easy branching of a single fiber from any portion by rupturing or removing the sheath 12 at any position.<br>
Further, with respect to the glass fiber 13, it is favorable that the mode field diameter (MFD) according to the definition<br>
of Petermann-I at the wavelength of 1.55[om is equal to or less than 10(im. It is more preferable that the mode field diameter (MFD) is equal to or less than 8jam.<br>
By decreasing the mode field diameter, it is possible to reduce the microbend loss and macrobend loss. Accordingly, it<br><br>
is possible to suppress ihe increase of transmission loss attributed to an external force which the optical fiber ribbon * 2*10 receives in the groove. Further, since the increase of the transmission loss is small even when the optical fiber 11 is bent with a small bending radius, it is possible to perform the live-line branching easily.<br>
The optical fiber ribbon 210 is formed with a thickness of the sheath 12 which is smaller than a thickness of a sheath of the related-art optical fiber ribbon. Here, assuming a maximum<br>
value of thickness of the optical fiber ribbon 210 as T(nm) and<br>
an outer diameter of the optical fiber 11 as d(nm) , the thickness t of the sheath 12 can be obtained by a formula t = (T-d) /2, wherein the thickness of the sheath 12 is set such that the optical fiber ribbon 210 satisfies T 
With the use of the optical fiber ribbon 210 having the<br>
thin sheath 12, it is possible to obtain, at a low cost, the optical fiber cable 201 from which the optical fiber ribbon can be extremely easily taken out at an intermediate portion while ensuring the high packing density and mechanical properties which the related-art optical fiber cable adopting the SZ spacer has.<br>
In this manner, since the thickness t of the sheath 12 of the optical fiber ribbon 210 is small, the sheath 12 can be easily peeled off by generating cracks and peeling-of f by a manual operation of an operator or using a branching tool. Accordingly,<br><br>
the optical fiber 11 can be easily branched by peeling off the sheath 12 from the optical fiber ribbon 210. That is, the optical fiber ribbon 210 adopts the structure which enables the easy intermediate post branching operation.<br>
With respect to the above-mentioned intermediate post branching method, the branching method which has been explained in conjunction with Fig. 2A to Fig. 2C is used.<br>
Here, the relationship between the operability of the intermediate post branching and the increase of live-line loss during such an operation due to the difference in the thickness of the" sheath 12 is shown in Table 10. Further, in Table 10, the polarization mode dispersion (PMD) in a state that the optical fibers -are housed in the SZ spacer in the optical fiber cable 201. and the results of the separation experiment showing the strength of integrity of the optical fibers are shown. Here, the outer diameter d of the optical fibers in the optical fiber<br>
ribbon shown in Table 10 is 250^im. Further, the Young's modulus of resin which constitutes the sheath 12 is 900MPa.<br><br><br><br>
Here, the optical fiber ribbon with the sheath having the thickness t of 0.0 in Table 10 indicates the optical fiber ribbon in which' the resin does not cover the whole optical fibers as shown in Fig. 10.<br>
The intermediate post branching property shown in Table 10 indicates the level of easiness for branching with the increase of the transmission loss held at 1. OdB or less when an intermediate portion of the optical fiber ribbon is branched into respective optical fibers. With respect to the evaluation criteria used in this specification, "very good" means that the branching can be performed within 2 minutes, "good" means that the branching can be performed in*-an operation time exceeding two minutes and within three minutes and "fair" indicates that the branching can be performed in an operation time exceeding three minutes and within 5 minutes. Further, "not good" indicates that the branching requires an average operation time which exceeds 5 minutes.<br>
Here, the fact that the increase of the transmission loss at the time of branching is equal to or less than 1. OdB means that the live-line branching can be performed.<br>
Here&gt; the test on the intermediate post branching property is explained.<br>
First of all, as shown in Fig. 21A, with respect to the optical fiber ribbon 210, in a state that the sheath having a length of approximately lm is left, a light source 220 for allowing<br><br>
the incidence of light having a wavelength of 1.55pm into a first optical fiber 11a is connected to the optical fiber 11a at one end of the optical fiber ribbon 210, while a stora-ge oscilloscope 222 and a light receiver 221 are connected to the optical fiber 11a at the other side of the optical fiber ribbon 210.  In this<br>
state, the light having a wavelength of 1.55jxm is incident on the first optical fiber 11a from the light source 22 0. The incident<br>
light is transmitted to the other side of the optical fiber 11a and is received by the receiver 221. An received light quantity of the received light is observed by the storage oscilloscope 222 at proper times.<br>
Then, in a state that the incidence of light from the light source 220 is continued, as shown in Fig. 21B, the intermediate post branching of the optical fiber ribbon 210 is performed. That is, the first optical fiber 11a is branched as a single fiber from the optical fiber ribbon 210 in a live-line state (live-line branching). Here, an increased amount (increment) of the transmission loss due to the intermediate post branching is measured by the storage oscilloscope 222.<br>
A length of the optical fiber ribbon 210 which is subjected to the intermediate post branching is set to 50cm. "Further, the method for performing the intermediate post branching is conducted in accordance with the steps explained in conjunction with Fig. 2A to Fig. 2C.<br>
Among the optical fiber ribbons shown in Table 10, the<br><br>
optical fiber ribbons which exhibit the evaluations "very good", "good" and "fair" with respect to the intermediate post branching<br>
property have the ribbon thickness of 290pm or less, that is, satisfy T<d . all of these optical fiber ribbons can complete the intermediate post branching within five minutes while restricting increase transmission loss at time to odb or less. that is it possible perform live-line minutes.></d>
To the contrary, with respect to the related-art optical fiber ribbon having a large thickness of the sheath which exceeds<br>
the outer diameter d of the optical fiber by 40|am, the intermediate post branching property exhibits "not good". That is, the increment of the transmission lossat the time of branching-exceeds 1. OdB or even when the optical fiber can be branched, or the branching operation requires a given time which exceeds five<br>
minutes and hence, the live-line branching cannot be performed<br>
* »<br>
from a realistic viewpoint.<br>
The increase of live-line loss shown in Table 10 indicates an increase amount (increment) of the transmission loss generated during the intermediate post branching operation. As the evaluation criteria in this specification, "very good" means that the transmission loss is not increased by exceeding O.ldB during the branching operation, "good" means that the transmission loss is not increasedby exceeding 0. 5dB during the branching operation, and "fair" means that the transmission loss is not increased by<br><br>
exceeding 1.OdE during the branching operation.  Further, "not<br>
good " means that increased value cf rhe transmission loss exceeds<br>
l.OdB during the branching operation.<br>
Among the optical fiber ribbons shown in Table 10, the<br>
optical fiber ribbons which exhibit the evaluations "good" and<br>
"fair" with respect to the increase of the live-line loss have<br>
the ribbon thickness of 290|amor less, that is, satisfy T<d . all of these live-line optical fiber ribbons can complete the></d>
intermediate post branching while restricting the increase of<br>
the transmission loss at the rime of branching to 1. OdB or less.<br>
Particularly, with respect to the optical fiber ribbons which<br>
have the ribbon thickness T.pf 275jim or less, that is, satisfy T<d the increase of live-line loss exhibits and hence transmission can be further suppressed to a low level. accordingly these.optical fibers are more preferable.></d>
To the contrary, with respect to the related-art optical fiber ribbon whose thickness T exceeds the outer diameter d of<br>
the optical fiber by 40jam, rhe increase of the live-line loss exhibits "not good". Further, the increased value of the transmission less exceeds 1.OdB during the branching operation. The SZ cable PMD shewn in Table 10 indicates the link polarization mode dispersion in a state that the optical fiber ribbon 210 is housed in the groove 204 as shown in Fig. 20. Here, the link polarization mode dispersion indicates the maximum value<br><br>
of the PMD which car. be generated when the values of polarization mode dispersion (?KD) of all optical fibers 11 which are housed in the optical fiber cable 201 are processed statistically and a large number of equivalent optical fiber cables are connected in series. Here, the statistical process is performed based on the center limit theorem. Further, the measurement of the PMD is performed under the condition that the length of the optical fiber cable 201 is 1000m or more and uses a measuring equipment based on the interference method (6000B made by Suntec inc).<br>
As the evaluation criteria in this specification, "very good" means that the-link polarization mode dispersion (PMD) is equal to or less than 0.05 (ps/km17^) , "good" means that the link polarization mode dispersron exceeds 0.05(ps/km ) and is equal to or less than 0.1 (ps/kirr'*) , "fair" means that the link polarization mode dispersion exceeds 0.1(ps/km2/2) and is equal to or less than 0 .2 (ps/km1/2) , and "not good" means that the link polarization mode dispersion exceeds 0.2 (ps/km1/2) .<br>
In the tape slot type optical fiber cable, the optical fiber ribbons are arranged in the groove in a stacked manner and hence, a stress from a fixed direction is generated and birefringence is generated in the-optical fibers. Further, the birefringence is also liable to be easily generated also due to the curing shrinking of the sheath of the optical fiber ribbons. The sheath (resin) of the optical fiber ribbon shrinks by approximately 5% due to curing at the lime of manufacturing thereof .<br><br>
Due to this curing shrinking, an external force is applied tc the optical fiber and a stress is generated in the inside of the optical fiber. However, the optical fiber ribbon has a cross-sectional shape which is broadened in a widthwise direction and hence, the stress differs between the widthwise direction and the thickness direction. Particularly, the sheath arranged in the thickness direction of the optical fiber ribbon with respect to the optical fibers is contiguously formed in the widthwise direction of the optical fiber ribbon and hence, when the thickness of the sheath at these portions is large, the stress which is generated in the widthwise direction is increased whereby the. difference in stress in the widthwise direction and the thickness direction is increased.<br>
In this manner, in the tape slot type optical fiber cable, the PMD is liable to be easily increased. Particularly, with respect to the optical fiber cable using the SZ spacer, the optical fiber is bent in a complicated manner due to the inverted groove shape and hence, a tendency that the PMD is easily increased is observed.<br>
In this embodiment, the optical fiber ribbon having the thinner sheath than the related-art optical fiber ribbon is used, the birefringence which is generated due to curing shrinking can be suppressed to an extremely small value. Accordingly, the optical fiber cable of this embodiment can suppress the PMD to a low level.<br><br>
Among the optical fiber ribbons shown in Table 10, when<br>
the optical fiber cable satisfies T
The presence or non-presence of fiber separation shown in Table 10 shows the result of a separation test which indicates the strength of integrity of the optical fibers.<br>
In this separation test, as shown in Fig. 22, from a pay-off bobbin 224 around which the optical fiber ribbon 210 which constitutes an object to be tested is wound, the optical fiber ribbon 210 is fed to and is wound around a winding bobbin 225, and an external force is applied to the optical fiber ribbon 210 in the course of a pass line. The external force applied to the -optical fiber ribbon 210 is generated by giving a fixed tension to the optical fiber ribbon 210 by means of a weight loading part 22 6 which is constituted of a dancer roller and a weight and, at the same time, by imparting bending of a small"diameter to the optical fiber ribbon 210 in the reverse direction using two rods 22 7 having a diameter of 3mm.<br>
As the evaluation criteria on the separation of fibers in this specification, "good" means that there is no separation betv;een the optical fiber and the sheath (resin) and the optical fiber ribbon is held in an integrated form in the longitudinal direction, ■ and "not good" means that there arise a portion where the optical fiber and the sheath (resin) are separated from each<br><br>
other.<br>
Among the optical fiber ribbons shown in Table 10, when<br>
the optical fiber ribbons satisfy the relationship T&gt;d+1 (\xra) , the separation of the optical fiber ribbon is not generated and<br>
hence, the optical fibers are favorable.  That is, it is found that when the thickness t of the sheath is equal to or more than<br>
0.5^un, the optical fiber cable can have the sufficient strength to integrate the respective optical fibers.<br>
Among the optical fiber ribbons shown in Table 10, the optical fiber ribbon which satisfies the relationship T=d (see Fig. 10) generates the separation portions in the separation experiment. However, by taking the fact that the external force such as ironing which is applied to therf„optical fiber ribbons is reduced in the line at the time of manufacturing the optical fiber cable into consideration, it is possible to prevent the drawback that the separation of ribbon occurs in the manufacturing step for forming the optical fibers into a cable. Further, with respect to the optical fiber ribbon which satisfies the relationship T=d, since the sheath is substantially eliminated at the portion in the thickness direction of the optical fiber ribbon which passes the centers of the respective optical fibers, the respective optical fibers can be easily peeled off in the widthwise direction of the optical fiber ribbon and hence, the intermediate post branching can be perform favorably compared to the optical fiber ribbon having a shape which covers the whole<br><br>
of respective optical fibers with the sheath.<br>
With respect to the optical fiber ribbon 10A shown in Fig. 10 in which the resin 12aA does nor cover the whole of respective optical fibers 11A, the respective optical fibers 11A are integrated by merely using an adhesive strength between the resin 12aA and the optical fibers. To the contrary, with respect to the optical fiber ribbon 10 shown in Fig. 1A, the resin integrally covers the whole of respective optical fibers 11 with the resin which constitutes the sheath 12 and hence, the optical fiber ribbon 10 easily maintains a state in which the whole of the optical fiber ribbon 10 is integrated due to a force which intends to hold the shape of the sheath 12 per se besides the adhesive strength between the resin and the optical fibers.<br>
Further, in the above-mentioned optical fiber ribbon (see Fig. 1A) , by setting the ratio between the product of Young's modulus E and the cross-sectional area S of the sheath (resin) 12 and the sum of products of the Young's moduli E and the cross-sectional areas S of the respective optical fibers 11 to a proper value, the PMD can be reduced. An amount of stress which acts on the optical fiber 11 when the sheath 12 generates the curing shrinking is increased corresponding to the increase of the Young's modulus of the resin which constitutes the sheath 12 and the increase of the thickness of the sheath 12. Here, a cause which brings about the increase of the PMD is a strain which is generated in the glass fiber 13 of the optical fiber<br><br>
11. An amount of strain is determined based on an amount of force which reaches the glass fiber 13 through a coating layer including a primary protective coating 14, a second protective coating 15 and a color layer and the Young's modulus of the glass fiber 13.<br>
Then, the relationship between the ES product ratio of the sheath 12 with respect to the optical fibers 11 and the SZ cable PMD is reviewed under the respective conditions that the Young's modulus of the sheath 12 assumes 700MPa, 900MPa, 1200MPa and 1500 MPa respectively when the thickness T of the optical fiber ribbon 210 differ, that is, when the thickness of the sheath 12 differs.<br>
Here, the glass fiber 13 has the Young' s modulus of 73000MPa<br>
and has the outer diameter of 125pm. The primary protective coating 14 has the Young' s modulus of IMPa and has the outer diameter<br>
of 200p.m. The secondary protective coating 15 has the Young's modulus of 700MPa and has the outer diameter of 240pm. The color layer has the Young' s modulus of 1500MPa and has the outer diameter<br>
of 2 5 0|im.<br>
The relationship between the ES product ratio and the SZ cable PMD when the Young's modulus of the sheath 12 is 700MPa is shown in Table 11.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
As shown in Table 11 to Table 14, the condition that the SZ cable PMD obtain "good" or "fair" , that is, the condition that the link PMD of all fibers of the optical fibers housed in the optical fiber cable having the SZ spacer assumes 0.2 (ps/km1/2) is a case that the ES product ratio assumes a value equal to or less than 0.02 6. Further, the condition that the SZ cable PMD obtain "very good", that is, the condition that the link PMD of all fibers of the optical fibers housed in the optical fiber cable having the SZ spacer assumes 0.1 (ps/km1/2) is a case that the ES product ratio assumes a value equal to or less than 0.020.<br>
In this manner, by setting the ES product ratio of the sheath 12 with respect to the optical fibers 11 to a given value, it is possible to suppress the PMD of the optical fibers 11 to a low level.<br>
Further, as the optical fiber ribbon 210 which is housed in the optical fiber cable according to the first embodiment of the present invention, the optical fiber ribbon 110 shown in Fig. 11A can be named. That is, with respect to the optical fiber ribbon 210, recessed portions 16 are formed in the sheath 12 in conformity with the indentations formed between the neighboring optical fibers 111, 111. In the sheath 112 which covers the optical fibers 111, the recessed portion 116 includes a bottom portion 117 as a portion having the largest indentation.<br>
As described above, the thickness of the sheath which is formed on the periphery of the optical fiber 111 is preferably<br><br>
small from a viewpoint of reduction of the PMD and it is more preferable that the thickness of the sheath 12 is approximately<br>
0. 5|im. However, in manufacturing such an optical fiber ribbon actually, it is preferable that a certain degree of thickness is ensured. The reason is that in an attempt to make the thickness of the resin which constitutes the sheath thin, there is a possibility that the resin is not applied partially (this phenomenon being referred to as "shortage of resin". Accordingly,<br>
it is preferable to form the sheath having a thickness of 2.5jom or more with respect to the optical fibers 111. In this case, to reduce an amount of the resin in the thickness direction of the optical fiber ribbon while ensuring a given sheath thickness, the sheath formed between the indentation of the neighboring optical fibers may be reduced. Portions where-the shortage of resin is liable to occur are portions where the outer diameter of the optical fiber assumes the largest value in the thickness direction of the optical fiber ribbon and hence, the reduction of an amount of the resin between the neighboring optical fibers does not obstruct the reliable coating of the resin.<br>
Accordingly, the formation of the recessed portions 116 as shown in Fig. 11A can suppress the increase of the PMD while preventing the shortage of resin.<br>
Further, the recessed portions 116 formed in the sheath 112 are effective in branching the optical fibers 111 by peeling off the sheath 112 from the optical fiber ribbon 210. The larger<br><br>
the number of portions where the sheath 112 is thin, the rupture of the sheath 112 is liable to occur and hence, the branching operation can be performed easily. Further, since the branching operation can be performed easily, an external force imparted to the optical fiber can be made small during the branching operation and hence, the increase of the live-line branching loss can be suppressed to a minimum amount.<br>
In the optical fiber ribbon 110 shown in Fig. 11A, the depth Y of the recessed portions 116 is set shorter than a distance between the common tangent SI of the sheath 112 and the common tangent S2 of the respective optical fibers 111. That is, the recessed portion 116 is formed such that the position of the bottom portion 117 is disposed outside the common tangent S2 of the respective optical fibers 111.<br>
Further, it is possible to use the optical fiber ribbon 110A shown in Fig. 13A which is another embodiment obtained by partially modifying the constitution of the optical fiber ribbon 110 shown in Fig. 11A.<br>
In Fig. 13A, the sheath 112A which covers the outer peripheries of the optical fibers 111A is formed into a recessed or corrugated shape in conformity with the indentation formed between the neighboring optical fibers 111A. In this case, the recessed portions 116A formed in the sheath are made deeper than the recessed portions 116 shown in Fig. 11A^ That is, the optical fiber ribbon 110A is formed such that the bottom portions 117A<br><br>
of the recessed portions 116A are positioned inside the common<br>
tangent S2A of the optical fibers 111A.<br>
Here, in housing the optical fiber ribbon in the groove<br>
* shown in Fig. 20, the distance from the center of the spacer differs<br>
between the optical fiber which is positioned at the end portion<br>
in the widthwise direction of the optical fiber ribbon and the<br>
optical fiber which is positioned inside the former optical fiber.<br>
Accordingly, in the state that the optical fibers are housed in<br>
the inside of the spirally formed groove, the difference in length<br>
arises in the inside of the groove between the optical fiber at<br>
the end portion and the optical fiber at the inside and hence,<br>
a stress is generated in the optical fibers. This stress imparts<br>
the anisotropic stress to the glass fiber together with a stress<br>
generated by bending of the optical fibers in the groove and hence,<br>
the birefringence is generated and this becomes a cause of the<br>
increase of the PMD.<br>
To the contrary, in the optical fiber ribbon 110A shown<br>
in Fig. 13A, the recessed portions are formed in the sheath and<br>
hence, as shown in Fig. 14, the optical fiber ribbon 110A is easily<br>
deflectable in the widthwise direction. Accordingly, when the<br>
optical fiber ribbon 110A is housed in the groove, no excessive<br>
force is imparted to the optical fiber ribbon 110A and hence,<br>
the difference in length in the inside of the groove which is<br>
generated between the optical fiber at the end portion and the<br>
optical fiber at the inside is resolved whereby it is considered<br><br>
that the cable PMD can be improved. Further, the sheath 112A of the optical fiber ribbon 110A approximates a circular shape along the outer peripheries of the optical fibers 111A and hence, the anisotropy of the curing shrinking stress of the sheath 12A which may occur in manufacturing the optical fiber ribbon 110A can be reduced whereby it is considered that the reduction of the PMD of the optical fiber ribbon 110A in a cable state can be enhanced. Here, this advantageous effect is also obtained by the optical fiber ribbon 110 shown in Fig. 11A, the optical fiber ribbon 110A having the deeper recessed portions can exhibit the advantageous effect more apparently.<br>
Here, with respect to the depth of the recessed portions formed in the sheath shown in Fig. 11 and Fig. 13A, thg prevention of separation of the optical fiber at the time of manufacturing the optical fiber ribbonby arranging a plurality of optical fibers inparallel andby integrating themusing the sheath, the prevention * * of peeling-off of the sheath (becomes a cause of separation of the optical fibers) at the time of performing the installation operation of the optical fiber ribbon, or the increase or decrease of transmission loss during the favorable branching operation or the live-line branching are reviewed. As a result, it is found that it is preferable that the recessed portions are formed such that the recessed portions do not exceed the common tangent which is formed by the neighboring optical fibers. That is, it is found that it is favorable that the recessed portions are formed at<br><br>
the inner side than the common tangent.<br>
The result of the review is specifically explained hereinafter.<br>
With respect to cases in which the thickness T(|im) of the<br>
optical fiber ribbon is set to 270nm, 280|im and 290|im, a ratio<br>
t/Y which is a ratio of the thickness t(|xm) of the sheath with<br>
respect to the depth Y(JJHL) of the recessed portion and a ratio<br>
g/d which is a ratio of thickness g (|im) of the optical fiber ribbon<br>
at the recessed portion with respect to the outer diameter d(|im)<br>
of the optical fiber when the depth Y(jim)of the recessed portion differs are calculated, and the intermediate post branching<br>
property, the increase of live-line loss and the SZ cable PMD in respective cases are reviewed.<br>
The relationship among the intermediate post branching property, the increase of live-line loss and the SZ cable PMD<br>
when the thickness T of the optical fiber ribbon is 270(im is shown in Table 15. Here, the ratio (T-d)/2Y in^the table is an equivalent value as t/Y.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
As shown in Table 15 to Table 17, in any one of the intermediate post branching property, the increase of live-line loss and the SZ cable PMD, the larger the depth Y of the recessed portions, the favorable results are obtained.<br>
Further, when the thickness T of the optical fiber ribbon<br>
is ei~her 270^m or 2 8 0|xm, that is, when the thickness T of the optical fiber ribbon satisfies T
intermediate post branching property, the increase of live-line loss. The reason is considered that when the branching tools shown in Fig. 12A to Fig. 12C are used, due to the advantageous effects of the recessed portions, the branching property is improved than the optical fiber ribbon which merely reduces the thickness of the sheath. For example, while the evaluation of the intermediate post blanching property is "good" when the ribbon<br><br>
thickness T is set to 270|_tm as shown in Table 10, the evaluation of the intermediate post blanching property is " very good" when<br>
the ribbon thickness is set to 280|im and the depth Y of the recessed portions is set to 5pm as shown in Table 16 and hence, the advantageous effect of the recessed portion can be confirmed.<br>
Further, to focus on the intermediate post branching property, it is understood that the intermediate post branching property is particularly associated with the value of the ratio (T-d)/2Y. For example, when the ratio (T-d)/2Y is equal to or less than 4, it is possible to obtain the favorable intermediate post branching property.<br>
Further, to focus on the SZ cable PMD, it is understood that the SZ cable PMD is particularly associated with the value of the ratio g/d. For example, when -the ratio g/d is equal to or less than 1.0, that is, when the bottom portion is inside the common tangent, it is possible to obtain the remarkable PMD suppression effect while sufficiently reducing an amount of the resin.<br>
When the ratio g/d is equal to or less than 1.0, the sheath is thin to prevent the bottom portion from being disposed outside the common tangent and hence, the sheath is easily bendable in the longitudinal direction and, at the same time, the recessed portion is deep and hence, the deflection shown in Fig. 14 is easily generated whereby it is considered that the cable PMD can be effectively suppressed.<br><br>
Further, when the ratio g/d is equal to or less than 0.8, the PMD in a state that the optical fibers is housed in the spacer can be further effectively suppressed.<br>
In general coating of the optical fibers, the primary protective coating which exhibits the low Young' s modulus covers the periphery of the glass fiber and the outer periphery of the primary protective coating is covered with the secondary protective coating and the color layer having the high Young's modulus. Further, the outer diameter of the primary protective coating is approximately 0.8 times as large as the thickness of the outer diameter d of the optical fiber. Then, when the resin in the recessed portion is in a range which does not exceed the primary protective coating, the sheath is liable to be easily deformed and hence, the deflection shown in Fig. 14 is easily generated. Accordingly, the PMD can be further suppressed.<br>
In the optical fiber ribbon having the recessed portions shown in Fig. 11A and Fig. 13A, it is desirable that the recessed portions of the sheath are formed in a smooth curved shape R. This is because, for example, when the recessed portions have bottom portions thereof formed in an acute shape along the shape of the optical fiber ribbon, a stress is concentrated on the bottom portions of the recessed portions and hence, ruptures and cracks are liable to be easily generated.<br>
Further, in the optical fiber ribbon used for the optical fiber cable according to the present invention shown in Fig. 1A,<br><br>
Fig. 10, Fig. 11A and Fig. 13A, the adhesive strength between the optical fiber and the sheath sometimes affects the increase of the transmission loss and the live-line^operation efficiency at the time of performing the live-line branching. With respect to the adhesive strength of the optical fiber and the sheath (resin), to take the prevention of the increase of the transmission loss and the branching operability into consideration, it is favorable that the adhesive strength per one optical fiber falls within a range 0.245 (mN) to 2. 4 5 (mN) . When the above-mentioned adhesive strength is smaller than the above-mentioned range, there may arise a case that the sheath is ruptured at the time of being formed into a cable and the optical fibers are separated from each othe£. On the other hand, when the adhesive strength is larger than the above-mentioned range, the branching property is deteriorated.<br>
Here, the adhesive strength between the optical fiber and the sheath is measured using the above-mentioned method explained " in conjunction with Fig. 5 and Fig. 6.<br>
In the optical fiber ribbon used in the present invention, when the main object of the invention lies in that the optical fibers Jceep the integrity without being separated from each other, it is favorable that the thickness of the sheath is equal to or more than 0.5|xm. In this case, the maximum thickness T of the optical fiber ribbon becomes T&gt; outer diameter of the optical fiber d+1 (\m) .<br><br>
Also depending on the properties of the sheath of the optical<br>
fiber ribbon, in some cases, these properties affect the increase<br>
of the transmission loss and the branching operation efficiency<br>
at the live-line branching. It is preferable that the yield point<br>
stress, as the property of material of the sheath, falls within<br>
a range of 20MPa to 45Mpa. This is because that the branching<br>
operation can be performed easily and the transmission loss at<br>
the time of performing the live-line branching can be suppressed.<br>
In accordance with JIS K7113, the yield point stress is measured<br>
with respect to a No. 2 test piece at a tension speed of 50mm/minute.<br>
When the yield point stress is less than 20MPa, there arises a<br>
case in which the respective optical fibers are separated by an<br>
external force which is applied to the optical fibers during a<br>
step of assembling the optical fiber ribbons to form a cable and<br>
hence, the^ cable caxmot be formed* On the other hand, when the<br>
yield point stress exceeds 45MPa, it is difficult to rupture the<br>
sheath arid hehc~eT tfre^	branching of the "optical<br>
fiber ribbon is hard to perform.<br>
Further, in this embodiment, with respect to the optical fiber cable:-201--shown: in Fi-gv~20&gt; the-transmission loss value and the polarizatioTtmode dispersion {PMD) value ata wavelength<br>
of 1, 55|om are measured. Further, anamount of increase (increment) of the transmission loss at the time of performing the intermediate<br>
post branching is measured.<br>
Here, ;rthe optical fiber ribbon used here is the optical<br><br>
■•".' fiber ribbon 110A shown in Fig. 13A and a thickness T of the optical<br>
fiber ribbon 11A is 260|xm. The outer diameter d of the optical<br>
fiber 11A is 250pm.  Further, the thickness^ t of the sheath is<br>
«<br>
5^ and the depth Y of the recessed portions is 30pm. The thickness<br>
g of the optical fiber ribbon at the recessed portions is 200fom. However, among the optical fibers which are integrated<br>
as the optical fiber ribbon, 100 fibers are selected from optical<br>
fibers which conform to G652 and the remaining 100 fibers have<br>
the mold filed diameter of equal to or less than 10pm.<br>
With respect to the transmission loss value of the optical fibers in a state that they are housed in the optical fiber cable 201, the optical fibers which conform to G652 exhibit the maximum value of 0.2.3dB/km and the average value of 0.21dB/km, while the<br>
optical fibers whose mode field diameter is 10(jm or less exhibit the maximum value of 0.21dB/km and the average value of 0.20dB/km. Further, with respect to the polarization mode dispersion value, the optical fibers which conform to G652 exhibit the average value of 0 . 025 (ps/km1/2) , the standard deviation of 0 . 020 (ps/km1/2) and the link PMD of 0, 046 (ps/km1/2) , while the optical, fibers whose<br>
mode field diameter is lOpm or less exhibit the average value of 0.022 (ps/km1/2) , the standard deviation of 0.018 (ps/km1/2) and<br>
the link PMD of 0 . 042 (ps/km1/2) .<br>
In this manner, with respect ro the transmission loss and the PMD of the optical fibers after being formed into the cable, the optical fibers whose mode field diameter is lOpmor less exhibit<br><br>
the more favorable characteristics.<br>
Further, as mentioned above, the optical fiber cable adopting the SZ spacer exhibits the favorable intermediate post branching property. Accordingly, this optical fiber cable is, in many cases, used as a subscriber-system communication path which connects between a station and an ordinary subscriber. Accordingly, the length of the optical fiber cable adopting the SZ spacer is, in many cases, shorter than the optical fiber cable for a relay system which connects stations and is several tens km at the longest. However, when one optical fiber is allocated to one subscriber from the station to the subscribers, in case the number of the subscribers is large, the optical fiber cable capable of housing a large number of optical fibers becomes necessary andhence, the diameter of the optical fiber cablebecomes large-sized. This situation is not favorable in installing the optical fiber cable in a conduit. Accordingly, the wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) technique which superposes signals of many subscribers in one optical fiber is effective and there exists a strong demand for an optical fiber cable which can transmit signals at a high speed.<br>
As in the case of the optical fiber cable according to the present invention, when the link PMD is equal to or less than 0.2(ps/km372), the transmittable distance becomes 156km in case the transmission rate is 400Gbps and hence, it is possible to ensure a sufficient communication quantity to the subscriber<br><br>
system.<br>
Further, when link PMD is equal to or less than 0.1 (ps/km1/2) , the transmittable distance becomes 625km in case the transmission rate is 40Gbps and the transmittable distance becomes 156km in case the transmission rate is 80Gbps and hence, it is more preferable.<br>
Here, the method for measuring the transmission loss by performing the intermediate post branching from the optical fiber cable is explained in conjunction with Fig. 23.<br>
First of all, as shown in Fig. 23, out of an arbitrary optical fiber ribbon, a light source 220 for allowing the incidence<br>
of light having a wavelength of 1.55|am into a first optical fiber 11a is connected to the optical fiber 11a at one end side of the optical fiber cable 201, while a light receiver 221 and a storage oscilloscope 222 are connected to the optical fiber 11a at the other side of the optical fiber cable 201. In this state, a light having a wavelength of 1.55m is incrdent on the first optical fiber 11a from the light source 220. The incident light is transmitted to the other side of the optical fiber 11a and is received by the receiver 221. An received light quantity of the received light is observed by the storage oscilloscope 222 at proper times.<br>
Then, in a state that the incidence of light from the light source 220 is continued, the sheath and the press winding are removed at an intermediate portion of the optical fiber cable<br><br>
201 by a length of approximately 500mm, a spacer 203 is bent while being twisted and the optical fiber ribbon 10c including the optical fiber 11a on which the licht of the liaht source 220 is incident is taken out from the groove. Then, the optical fiber ribbon 10c is branched into a plurality of single fibers and a fourth fiber lib is cut. Here, the method for branching the optical fiber ribbon 10c is performed in accordance with the above-mentioned steps explained in conjunction with Fig. 2A to Fig. 2C.<br>
The measurement of the transmission loss is performed by observing the steps ranging from the removal of the sheath from the optical fiber cable 201 to the completion of the operation using the storage oscilloscope 222.<br>
As a result, the increase of the transmission loss of 1. OdB or more is not recognized with respect to the optical fibers which conform to the G652, while the increase of the transmission loss of 0.5dB or more is not recognised with respect to the optical<br>
fibers whose mode field diameter is equal to or below 10pm.<br>
Further, the experiment is performed with respect to another mode of the optical fiber cable according to the present invention in the same manner as the above-mentioned optical fiber cable 201.<br>
Although the optical fiber cable 201 shown in Fig. 20 is the optical fiber cable having the SZ spacer, the transmission loss value and the polarization mode dispersion (PMD) value at<br><br>
a wavelength cf 1. 55m are measured with respect to the 200 fibered type optical fiver cable 'net shown in the drawing) having a spacer twisted in one direction. Further, an amount of increase (increment) of the transmission loss at the time of performing the intermediate post branching is measured*<br>
The optical fiber cable which is an object of the experiment is substantially equal to the optical fiber cable 201 whose cross-section is shown in Fig. 20, wherein a diameter of the spacer is 12iran and a diameter of the sheath is 16mm. A tensile strength body which is arranged at the center is made of a steel wire and ten grooves are formed spirally in one direction along the longitudinal direction in a state that the grooves are arranged parallel to each other. The twisting direction of the grooves is the left twisting and the twisting pitch is 50 0mm.<br>
Here, the optical fiber ribbon used here is equal to the optical fiber ribbon cf the above-mentioned optical fiber cable 201. -However, ail of 200 fibers are formed of optical fibers •which conform to G652.<br>
With respect to the transmission loss value of the optical fibers in a state that they are housed in the optical fiber cable 201, the optical fibers exhibit the maximum value of 0.22dB/km and the average value of 0.20dB/km. Further, with respect to the polarization mode dispersion value, the average value is 0.C27 (ps/kmi/2) , the standard deviation is 0.021 (ps/km1/2) and the link ?MD is 0. 048 (ps/km1/:) .<br><br>
Further, in the intermediate post branching experiment which is substantially similar to the above-mentioned optical fiber cable 201, the increase of the transmission loss of 1. OdB or more is not recognized.<br>
Further, the experiment is performed with respect to another mode of the optical fiber cable according to the present invention shown in Fig. 2 4 in the same manner as the above-mentioned optical fiber cable 201.<br>
Although the optical fiber cable 201 shown in Fig. 20 is the 200-fibered optical fiber cable having the SZ spacer, the optical fiber cable shown in Fig. 24 is an 1000-fibered optical fiber cable 201a having a slot twisted in one direction. The transmission loss value and the polarization mode dispersion (PMD)<br>
value at a wavelength of 1.55^im are measured with respect to this optical fiver cable 201a.  Further, an amount of increase (increment) of the transmission loss at the time of performing the intermediate post branching is measured.<br>
In the optical fiber cable 201a which is an object of the experiment, a diameter of a spac-er 2 CI a is 2 3mm and an outer diameter of a sheath 20 6d is 2 8mm. A tensile strength body which is arranged at the center is made of seven steel wires 202a which are twisted spirally and thirteen grooves 204a are formed spirally in one direction along the longitudinal direction in a state that the grooves are arranged in parallel tc each other. Among thirteen grooves 204a, ten sheets of optical fiber ribbons 210d are housed<br><br>
in each one of twelve grooves in a stacked manner, while five sheets of optical fiber ribbons 210d are housed in one remaining groove 204a which is formed with a small depth in a stacked manner v The twisting direction of the grooves 204a is the left twisting and the twisting pitch is 500mm.<br>
Here, each optical fiber ribbon 210d which is housed in the optical fiber cable 210a is an eight-fibered optical fiber ribbon 210d shown in Fig. 25. This eight-fibered optical fiber ribbon 210d is manufactured by modifying the four-fibered optical fiber ribbon 110A shown in Fig. 13A. Further, among the housed 1000 0-fibered optical fibers, 500-fibered optical fibers are formed of optical fibers which conform to the G652 and remaining 500-fibered optical fibers are formed of optical fibers whose<br>
mode field diameter is equal to or less than lOjxm.<br>
With respect to the transmission loss value of the optical fibers in a state that they are housed in the optical fiber cable 201a, the optical fibers which conform to G652 exhibit the maximum value of 0.22dB/km and the average value of 0.20dB/km, while the optical fibers whose mode field diameter is equal to or less than<br>
lOfjun exhibit the maximum value of 0.21dB/km and the average value of O.lSdB/km,<br>
Further, with respect to the polarization mode dispersion value, the optical fibers which conform to G652 exhibit the average value of 0.02 0 (ps/km1/2) , the standard deviation of 0.015 (ps/km1/2) and the link PMD of 0. 042 (ps/km1/2) , while the optical fibers whose<br><br>
mode field diameter is equal to or less than lOjjin exhibit the average value of 0.026 (ps/kirr/2) , the standard deviation of 0.018 (ps/km1/2) and the link PMD cf 0 . 044 (ps/km1/2) .<br>
Further, in the intermediate post branching experiment which is substantially similar to the above-mentioned optical fiber cable 201 (however, the sheath 6dremoval lengthbeing 750mm) , the increase of the transmission loss of 1. OdB or more is not recognized with respect to the optical fibers which conform to the G652, while the increase of the transmission loss of 0. 5dB or more is not recognized with respect to the optical fibers whose<br>
mode field diameter is equal to or below 10pm.<br>
In this manner, the optical fiber cable whose increase of loss at the time of performing the intermediate post branching is 1.OdB or less can favorably perform the intermediate post branching in a live-line state andhence, it is possible to properly take out only the desired optical fiber by branching and to use other optical fibers at the downstream side. Accordingly, it is possible to effectively make use of all optical fibers housed -in the optical fiber cable. Accordingly, the construction cost of the communication line can be suppressed to a low level.<br>
Further, the optical fiber cable whose increase of loss at the time of performing the intermediate post branching is 0 . 5dB or less can take out the desired optical fiber even when the high-speed communication is performed using the optical fiber which is not branched or even when the communication is performed<br><br>
in an area where the dynamic range is small. Accordingly, the degree of freedom in designing the optical communication system is remarkably enhanced.<br>
Next, the optical fiber cable according to the second embodiment of the present invention is explained in detail in conjunction with the drawings.<br>
Fig. 26A is a cross-sectional view of an optical fiber cable according to the second embodiment of the present invention and Fig. 26B is a side view thereof. As shown in Fig. 26A, this loose tube type optical fiber cable 301 forms a f our-f ibered optical fiber ribbon 310 by arranging four optical fibers having an outer<br>
diameter of approximately 250fxm in parallel and by covering them ..in a ribbon shape with an ultraviolet ray curable resin. This four-fibered optical fiber ribbon 310 has a width of 1.1mm and a thickness of 0 .27mm. Four sheets of these optical fiber ribbons 310 are stacked to form a stacked body 309. The stacked body 309 is housed in a plastic-made tube 308 which is ' made of polybutylene-terephthalate (PBT) having an outer diameter of 2.6mm. and an inner diameter of 1.8mm while twisting the stacked body 309 in one direction at a pitch of 1000mm. An oil-like jelly 7 is rilled in the inside of the plastic-made tube 308.<br>
As shown in Fig. 26B, six pieces of the tubes 308 are wound around a periphery of a tensile strength body 306 having an outer diameter of 2.6mm and made of G-FRP, for example, such that the tubes 308 are twisted (SZ twisting) by repeating an inverting<br><br>
portion, an intermediate portion and a transfer portion periodically at a pitch of 500mm. Then, a nylon string 305 is wound around them while pressing them and, thereafter, an unwoven press winding 304 is wound around (see Fig. 26A) . Then, a sheath 303 made of polyethylene and having a thickness of 1. 5mm is formed on the outside of the press winding 304. Accordingly, this optical fiber cable 301 has 96 fibers and has an outer diameter of 10mm. Further, in the inside of the press winding 304, a water absorbent 302 is filled.<br>
In the optical fiber cable 301, the direction that the tubes 308 are twistedisperiodicallyinvertedandhence, by cutting arbitrary portions of the sheath 303 and the press winding 304, it is possible to easily take out the ^optical fiber ribbon 310 from the inverted portion of the plastic-made tube 308. Accordingly, the loose tube type optical fiber cable 301 adopting the SZ twisting is the structure suitable for intermediate post branching. AI through the explanatiohis^ made that "the loose tube type optical fiber cable 301 adopts the SZ twisting, the manner of twisting is not limited to SZ twisting. For example, the present invention is also applicable to the loose tube type optical fiber cable which adopts one-directional twisting.<br>
In the optical fiber ribbon 310 which is housed in the tube 308, in the same manner as the above-mentioned optical fiber cable of the first embodiment, for example, as shown in Fig. 1A, a plurality of (four in this embodiment as an example) optical<br><br>
fibers 11 are arranged in parallel and, then, the whole outer peripheries of these optical fibers 11 arranged in parallel are covered with the sheath 12 which is formed of the resin over the entire length of the optical fibers 11. With respect to the detailed structure and the characteristics related to the optical fiber ribbon 310, the detailed description of the structure and characteristics is omitted.<br>
The optical fiber ribbon 310 is formed such that a thickness of the sheath 12 is smaller than a thickness of a sheath of the related-art optical fiber ribbon. Here, the thickness t of the sheath 12 is obtained by an equation t= (T-d)/2 when the maximum<br>
value of the thickness of the optical fiber ribbon 310 is T(nm) and the outer diameter of the optical fiber 11 as d(jjin) . In the optical fiber ribbon 310, the thickness-t of the sheath 12 is<br>
set such that a relationship T
than 20(jin.<br>
With the use of the optical fiber ribbon 310 having the<br>
thin sheath 12, the high packing density that the related-art<br>
loose tube type optical fiber cable has can be further enhanced<br>
and, at the same time, it is possible to obtain the optical fiber<br>
cable 301 which enables an extremely easy taking out of the optical<br>
fiber ribbon from an intermediate portion while ensuring the<br>
mechanical properties.<br>
In this manner, in the optical fiber ribbon 310, since<br><br>
the thickness t of the sheath 12 is small, the sheath 12 can be easily peeled off by generating cracks and peeling-off on the sheath by a manual operation of an operator or using a branching tool. Accordingly, the optical fiber 11 can be easily branched by peeling off the sheath 12 from the optical fiber ribbon 310. That is, the optical fiber ribbon 310 adopts the structure which enables the easy intermediate post branching operation.<br>
Further, the method for performing the intermediate post branching is performed in accordance with the above-mentioned steps which have been explained in conjunction with Fig. 2A-2C<br>
Here, the relationship between the operability of the intermediate post branching and the increase of live-line loss during such an operation due to the difference in the thickness t of the sheath 12 is shown in Table 18. Further, in Table 18, the polarizationmode dispersion in a state that the optical fibers are housed in the optical fiber cable 301 (loose tube cable PMD) and the results of the separation experiment showing the strength of integrity of the optical fibers are shown. Here, the outer diameter d of the optical fibers in the optical fiber ribbon shown<br>
in Table 18 is 250|im. Further, the Young' s modulus of resin which constitutes the sheath 12 is 900MPa.<br><br>
I 	t	I	1	1	1	I	I	I	I	,—I	1	1<br>
Here, the optical fiber ribbon with the sheath having the thickness t of 0.0 in Table 18 indicates the optical fiber ribbon in which the resin does not cover the whole optical fibers as shown in Fig. 10.<br>
The intermediate post branching property shown in Table 18 indicates the level of easiness for branching with the. increase of the transmission loss held at 1. OdB or less when an intermediate portion of the optical fiber ribbon is branched into respective optical fibers. With respect to the evaluation criteria used in this specification, "very good" means that the branching can be performed within 2 minutes, "good" means that the branching can be performed in an operation time exceeding two minutes and within three minutes and "fair" indicates that the branching can be performed in an operation time exceeding three minutes and within 5 minutes. Further, "not good" indicates that the branching requires an average operation time which exceeds 5<br><br>
minutes.<br>
Here, the fact that the increase of the transmission loss at the time of branching is equal to or less than 1. OdB means that the live-line branching can be performed.<br>
Here, the experiment of the intermediate post branching property is performed in the above-mentioned steps in conjunction with Figs. 21A and 21B.<br>
Among the optical fiber ribbons shown in Table 18, the optical fiber ribbons which exhibit the evaluations "very good", "good" and "fair" with respect to the intermediate post branching property have the ribbon thickness of 290^uu or less, that is, satisfy T<d . all of these optical fiber ribbons can complete the intermediate post branching within_f ive minutes while restricting increase transmission loss at time to odb or less that is it possible perform live-line within five minutes.></d>
To the contrary, with respect to the related-art optical fiber ribbon having a sheath which has a large thickness exceeding<br>
the outer diameter d of the optical fiber by 40^tm, the intermediate post branching property exhibits "not good".  That is, the<br>
increment of the transmission loss at the time of branching exceeds<br>
1. OdB or even when the optical fiber can be branched, the branching<br>
operation requires a given time which exceeds five minutes and<br>
hence, the live-line branching cannot be performed from a realistic<br>
viewpoint.<br><br>
The increase of live-line loss shown in Table 18 indicates an increase amount (increment) of the transmission loss generated during the intermediate post branching operation. As the evaluation criteria in this specification, "very good" means that the transmission loss is not increased by exceeding O.ldB during the branching operation, "good" means that the transmission loss is not increased by exceeding 0. 5dB during the branching operation, and "fair" means that the transmission loss is not increased by exceeding l.OdB during the branching operation. Further, "not good " means that increased value of the transmission loss exceeds 1.OdB during the branching operation.<br>
Among the optical fiber ribbons shown in Table 18, the<br>
optical fiber ribbons which exhibit the evaluations "good" and<br>
&gt;<br>
"fair" with respect to the increase of the live-line loss have<br>
the ribbon thickness T of 290|imor less, that is, satisfy T<d . all of these live-line optical fiber ribbons can complete the></d>
intermediate post branching while restricting the increase of the transmission loss at the time of branching to 1. OdB or less. Particularly, with respect to the optical fiber ribbons which have the ribbon thickness T of 275|am or less, that is, satisfy T<d the increase of live-line loss exhibits and hence transmission can be further suppressed to a low level. accordingly these optical fibers are more preferable.></d>
To the contrary, with respect to the related-art optical<br><br>
fiber ribbonhaving a large sheath thickness whose ribbon thickness<br>
T exceeds the outer diameter d of the optical fiber by 4 0^im, the increase of the live-line loss exhibits "not good" and the increased value of the transmission loss exceeds l.OdB during the branching operation.<br>
The loose tube cable PMD shown in Table 18 indicates the link polarization mode dispersion in a state that the optical fiber ribbon 310 is housed in the loose tube cable as shown in Fig. 26A. Here, the link polarization mode dispersion indicates the maximum value of the PMD which can be generated when the values of polarization mode dispersion (PMD) of all optical fibers 11 which are housed in the optical fiber cable 301 are processed statistically ajid a large number of equivalent optical fiber cables are connected in series. Here, the statistical process is performed based on the center limit theorem. Further, the measurement of the PMD is performed under the condition that the length of the optical fiber cable 301 is 1000m or more and uses a measuring equipment based on the interference method (6000B made by Suntec inc) .<br>
As the evaluation criteria in this specification, "very good" means that the link polarization mode dispersion (link PMD) is equal to or less than 0.05 (ps/km1/2), "good" means that the link polarization mode dispersion exceeds 0. 05 (ps/km1/2) and is equal to or less than 0.1 (ps/km1/2), "fair" means that the link polarization mode dispersion exceeds 0.1 (ps/km1/2) and is equal<br><br>
to or less than 0.2 (ps/km1/2), and "not good" means that the link polarization mode dispersion exceeds 0.2(ps/km1/2) .<br>
In the loose tube type optical fiber cable, the optical fiber ribbons are arranged in the tube in a stacked manner and hence, a stress from a fixed direction is generated and birefringence is generated in the optical fibers. Further, the birefringence is also liable to be easily generated due to the curing shrinking of the sheath of the optical fiber ribbons. The sheath (resin) of the optical fiber ribbon shrinks by approximately<br>
5% due to curing at the time of manufacturing thereof. Due to this curing shrinking, an external force is applied to the optical fiber and a stress is generated in the inside of the optical fiber. However, the optical fiber ribbon has a cross-sectional shape which is broadened in a widthwise direction and hence, the stress differs between the widthwise direction and the thickness direction. Particularly, the sheath arranged in the thickness direction of the optical fiber ribbon with respect to the optical fibers is contiguously formed in the widthwise direction of the optical fiber ribbon and hence, when the thickness of the sheath at these portions is large, the stress which is generated in the widthwise direction is increased whereby the difference in stress in the widthwise direction and the thickness direction is increased.<br>
In this manner, in the loose tube type optical fiber cable which houses the optical fiber ribbons, the PMD is liable to be<br><br>
easily increased. Particularly, when the tube is twisted in a SZ form, the optical fiber ribbon is bent in a complicated manner due to the inverted shape and hence, a tendency that the PMD is easily increased is observed.<br>
In this embodiment, the optical fiber ribbon having the thinner sheath than the related-art optical fiber ribbon is used, the birefringence which is generated due to curing shrinking can be suppressed to an extremely small value. Accordingly, the optical fiber cable of this embodiment can suppress the PMD to a low level.<br>
Among the optical fiber cables shown in Table 18, when<br>
the optical fiber cable satisfies TS d+25(|jm), the loose tube cable PMD becomes "good" and hence, it is understood that this - optical fiber cable is particularly favorable.<br>
The presence or non-presence of fiber separation shown in Table 18 shows the result of a separation test which indicates the strength of integrity of the optical fibers/<br>
This separation test is performed in accordance with the above-mentioned steps explained ^in conjunction with Fig. 22.<br>
As the evaluation criteria on the separation of fibers in this specification, "good" means that there is no separation between the optical fiber and the sheath (resin) and the optical fiber ribbon is held in an integrated form in the longitudinal direction, and "not good" means that there.,arise a portion where the optical fiber and the sheath (resin) are separated from each<br><br>
other.<br>
Among the optical fiber ribbons shown in Table 18, when<br>
the optical fiber ribbons satisfy the relationship T&gt;d+1(pim), the separation of the optical fiber ribbon is not generated and<br>
hence, the optical fiber cable is favorable. That is, it is found<br>
that when the thickness t of the sheath is equal to or more than<br>
0.51am, the optical fiber cable can have the sufficient strength to integrate the respective optical fibers.<br>
Among the optical fiber ribbons shown in Table 18, the optical fiber ribbon which satisfies the relationship T=d (see Fig. 10) generates the separation portions in the separation experiment. However, by taking the fact that the external force such as ironing which is applied., to the optical fiber ribbons is reduced in the line at the time of manufacturing the optical fiber cable into consideration, it is possible to prevent the drawback that the separation of ribbon occurs in the manufacturing step for forming the optical fibers into a cable. Further, with respect to the optical fiber ribbon which satisfies the relationship T=d, since the sheath is substantially eliminated at the portion in the thickness direction of the optical fiber ribbon which passes the centers of the respective optical fibers, the respective optical fibers can be easily separated in the widthwise direction of the optical fiber ribbon and hence, the intermediate post branching can be performed favorably compared to the optical fiber ribbon having a shape which covers the whole<br><br>
of respective optical fibers with the sheath.<br>
With respect to the optical fiber ribbon 10A shown in Fig. 10 in which the resin 12aA does not cover the whole of respective optical fibers 11A, the respective optical fibers 11A are integrated by merely using an adhesive strength between the resin 12aA and the optical fibers. To the contrary, with respect to the optical fiber ribbon 10 shown in Fig. 1A, the resin integrally covers the whole of respective optical fibers 11 which constitutes the sheath 12 and hence, the optical fiber ribbon 10 easily maintains a state in which the whole of the optical fiber ribbon 10 is integrated due to a force which intends to hold the shape of the sheath 12 per se besides the adhesive strength between the resin and the optical fibers.<br>
Further, in the above-mentioned optical fiber ribbon (see Fig. 1A), by setting the ratio between the product of Young's modulus E and the cross-sectional area S of the sheath (resin) 12 and the sum of "products of the Young's moduli E and the cross-sectional areas S of the respective optical fibers 11 to the proper value, the PMD can be reduced. An amount of stress which acts on the optical fiber 11 when the sheath 12 generates the curing shrinking is increased corresponding to the increase of the Young's modulus of the resin which constitutes the sheath 12 and the increase of the thickness of the sheath 12. Here, a cause which brings about the increase of the PMD is a strain which is generated in the glass fiber 13 of the optical fiber<br><br>
11. An amount of strain is determined based on an amount of force which reaches the glass fiber 13 through a coating layer including a primary protective coating 14, a second protective coating 15 and a color layer and the Young's modulus of the glass fiber 13.<br>
Then, the relationship between the ES product ratio of the sheath 12 with respect to the optical fibers 11 and the loose tube cable PMD is reviewed under the respective conditions that the Young's modulus of the sheath 12 assumes 700MPa, 900MPa, 1200MPa and 1500 MPa respectively when the thickness of the optical fiber ribbon 310 differs, that is, when the thickness of the sheath 12 differs.<br>
Here, the glass fiber 13 has the Young' s modulus of 73000MPa<br>
and^ has the outer diameter of 125jim. The primary protective coating -14 has the Young' s modulus of IMPaandhas the outer diameter<br>
of 200nirt. The secondary protective coating 15 has the Young's modulus of 700MPa and has the outer diameter of 240jam. The color layer has the Young' s modulus of 1500MPa and has the outer diameter<br>
of 250nin.<br>
The relationship between the ES product ratio and the loose tube cable PMD when the Young's modulus of the sheath 12 is 700MPa is shown in Table 19.<br><br><br>
The relationship between the ES product ratio and the loose tube cable PMD when the Young' s modulus of the sheath 12 is 900MPa is shown in Table 20.<br><br><br><br><br>
Here, the fiber ES product shown in Table 19 to Table 22 is the sum of respective ES products of regions which are constituted of the glass fiber 13, the primary protective coating 2 4, the secondary protective coating 15 and the color layer, while the resin ES product is an ES product of the sheath 12. The ES product ratio can be expressed as "resin ES product/fiber ES<br>
product".<br>
As shown in Table 19 to Table 22, the condition that the loose tube cable PMD obtain "good" or "f air", that is, the condition that the link PMD of all fibers of the optical fibers housed in the loose tube type optical fiber cable assumes 0.2 (ps/knr/2) or less is a case that the ES product ratio assumes a value equal to cr less than 0.02 6. Further, the condition that the loose tube cable PMD obtains "good", that is, the condition that the link PKD of all fibers of the optical fibers housed in the loose tube type optical fiber cable assumes 0.1 (ps/km1/2) or less is a case that the ES product ratio assumes a value equal to or less<br><br>
than 0.020.<br>
In this manner, by setting the ES product ratio of the sheathJL2 with respect to the optical fibers 11 to a desired value, it is possible to suppress the PMD of the optical fibers 11 to a low level.<br>
Further, as another preferred mode of the optical fiber ribbon which is housed in the optical fiber cable according to the second embodiment of the present invention, the optical fiber ribbon shown in Fig. 11A can be named. That is, as shown in Fig. 11A, with respect to the optical fiber ribbon 310, recessed port ions 116 are formed in the sheath 12 in conformity with the indentations formed between the neighboring optical fibers 111, 111 in the sheath 112 which covers the optical fibers 111. The recessed portion 116 includes a bottom portion 117 as a portion having the largest indentation. Further, the optical fiber ribbon 110A shown in Fig. 13A which constitutes another mode obtained by partially modifying the constitution of the optical fiber ribbon 110 shown in Fig. 11A can be named. The detailed explanation of the detail-ed structure and the characteristics of the optical fiber ribbon 310 is omitted.<br>
Here, in housing the optical fiber ribbon in the tube shown<br>
■s<br>
in Fig. 26A, since the stacked optical fiber ribbons are twisted in the inside of the tube, the distance from the center of twisting differs between the optical fiber which ispositioned at the end portion in the widthwise direction of the optical fiber ribbon<br><br>
and the optical fiber which is positioned inside the former optical fiber. Accordingly, the difference in length arises between the optical fiber at the end portion and the optical fiber at the inside and hence, a stress is generated in the optical fibers. This stress imparts the anisotropic stress to the glass fiber and hence, the birefringence is generated and this becomes a cause of the increase of the PMD.<br>
To the contrary, in the optical fiber ribbon 11OA shown in Fig. 13A, the recessed portions are formed in the sheath and hence, as shown in Fig. 14, the optical fiber ribbon 110A is easily deflectable in the widthwise direction. Accordingly, when the optical fiber ribbon 110A is housed in the tube, no excessive force is imparted to the optical fiber ribbon 110A and hence, the difference in length in the inside of the tube which is generated between the optical fiber at the end portion and the optical fiber at the inside is resolved whereby it is considered that the cable PMD can be improved. Further, the sheath 112A of the optical fiber ribbon 110A approximates a circular shape along the outer peripheries of the optical fibers 111A and hence, the,anisotropy of the curing shrinking stress of the sheath 112A which may occur in manufacturing the optical fiber ribbon 110A can be reduced whereby it is considered that the PMD of the optical fiber ribbon 110A in a cable state can be enhanced. Here, this advantageous effect is also obtained by the optical fiber ribbon 110 shown in Fig. 11A, the optical fiber ribbon 110A having the deeper<br><br>
recessed portions can exhibit the advantageous effect more apparently-<br>
Here, with respect to the depth of the recessed portions formed in the sheath shown in Fig. HAandFig. 13A, the prevention of separation of the optical fiber at the time of manufacturing the optical fiber ribbon by arranging a plurality of optical fibers inparallel andby integrating themusing the sheath, theprevention of peeling-of f (becomes a cause of separation of the optical fibers) at the time of performing the installation operation of the optical fiber ribbon, or the increase or decrease of transmission loss during the favorable branching operation or the live-line branching are reviewed. As a result, it is found that it is preferable that the recessed portions are formed sych that the recessed portions do not exceed the common tangent which is formed by the neighboring optical fibers. That is, it is found that it is favorable that the recessed portions are formed at the inner - side than the common tangent.<br>
The result of the review is specifically explained hereinafter.<br>
With respect to cases in which the thickness T (jam) of the optical fiber ribbon is set to 270jjm, 280^im and 290]Maf a ratio t/Y which is a ratio of the thickness t (|im) of the sheath with respect to the depth Y(JJHI) of the recessed portion and a ratio g/d which is a ratio of thickness g (jam) of the optical fiber ribbon at the recessed portion with respect to the outer diameter (urn)<br><br>
of the optical fiber when the depth d of the recessed portion differs are calculated, and the intermediate post branching property, the increase of live-line loss and the loose tube cable PMD are reviewed in respective cases.<br>
The relationship among the intermediate post branching property, the increase of live-line loss and the loose tube cable<br>
PMD when the thickness T of the optical fiber ribbon is 270(im is shown in Table 23. Here, the ratio (T-d)/2Y in the table is an equivalent value as t/Y.<br><br>
The relationship among the intermediate post branching property, the increase of live-line loss and the loose tube cable<br>
PMD when the thickness T of the optical fiber ribbon is 280|xm is shown in Table 24.<br><br><br><br><br>
As shown in Table 23 to Table 25, in any one of the intermediate post branching property, the increase of live-line loss and the SD cable PMD, the larger the depth Y of the recessed portions, the favorable results are obtained.<br>
Further, when the thickness T of the optical fiber ribbon<br>
is either 270pm or 280pm, that is, when the thickness T of the<br>
* *<br>
optical fiber ribbon satisfies T
 <br>
thickness T is set to 210\m as shown in Table 23, the evaluation of the intermediate post blanching property is M very good" when<br>
the ribbon thickness is^set to 280|iin and the depth Y of the recessed<br>
portions is set to 5\xxa as shown in Table 24 and hence, the advantageous effect of the recessed portion can be confirmed.<br>
Further, to focus on the intermediate post branching property, it is understood that the intermediate post branching property is particularly associated with the value of the ratio (T-d)/2Y. For example, when the ratio (T-d)/2Y is equal to or less than 4.0, it is possible to obtain the favorable intermediate post branching property.<br>
Further, to focus on the loose tube cable PMD, it is understood that the loose tube cable PMD is particularly associated with the value of the ratio g/d. For example, when the ratio g/d is equal to or less than 1, that is, when the bottom po'rtion is inside the common tangent of the optical fibers, it is possible to obtain the remarkable PMD suppression effect while sufficiently reducing an amount of the resin.<br>
When the ratio g/d is equal to or less than 1.0, the sheath is thin to prevent the bottom portion from being disposed outside the common tangent and hence, the sheath is easily bendable in the longitudinal direction and, at the same time, the recessed portion is deep and hence, the deflection shown in Fig. 14 is easily generated whereby it is considered_that the cable PMD can be effectively suppressed.<br><br>
Further, when the ratio g/d is equal to or less than 0.8, the PMD in a state that the optical fibers are housed in the loose<br>
tube type optical fiber cable can be further effectively<br>
■* »<br>
suppressed.<br>
In general coating of the optical fibers, the primary protective coating which exhibits the low Young' s modulus covers the periphery of the glass fiber and the outer periphery of the primary protective coating is covered with the secondary protective layer and the color layer having the high Young' s modulus. Further, the outer diameter of the primary protective covering is approximately 0.8 times as large as the thickness of the outer diameter d of the optical fiber. Then, when the resin of the recessed portion is in a range which does not exceed the primary protective coating, the sheath is liable to be easily deformed and hence, the deflection shown in Fig. 14 is easily generated. Accordingly, the PMD can be further suppressed.<br>
In the optical fiber ribbon having the recessed portions shown in Fig. 11A and Fig. 13A, it is desirable that the recessed portions of the sheath are formed in a smooth curved shape R. This is because, for example, when the recessed portions have bottom portions thereof formed in an acute shape along the shape of the optical fiber ribbon, a stress is concentrated on the bottom portions of the recessed portions and hence, ruptures and cracks are liable to be easily generated.<br>
Further, in the optical fiber ribbon used in the optical<br><br>
fiber cable according to the present invention shown in Fig. 1A, Fig. 10, Fig. 11A and Fig. 13A, the adhesive strength between the optical fiber and the sheath sometimes affects the increase of the transmission loss and the branching operation efficiency at the time of performing the live-line branching. With respect to the adhesive strength of the optical fiber and the sheath (resin) , to take the prevention of the increase of the transmission loss and the branching operability into consideration, it is favorable that the adhesive strength per one optical fiber falls within a range 0.245(mN) to 2.45(mN). When the above-mentioned adhesive strength is smaller than the above-mentioned range, there may .arise a case that the sheath is ruptured at the time of being formed into a cable and the optical fibers are separated from each other. On the other hand, when the adhesive strength is larger than the above-mentioned range, the branching property is deteriorated.<br>
Here, the adhesive strength between the optical fiber and the sheath is measured using the above-mentioned method explained in conjunction with Fig. 5 and Fig. 6.<br>
In the optical fiber ribbon used in the present invention, when the main object of the invention lies in that the optical fibers keep the integrity without being separated from each other, it is favorable that the thickness of the sheath is equal to or more than 0.5|im. In this case, the maximum thickness T of the optical fiber ribbon becomes T&gt; outer diameter of the optical<br><br>
fiber d+1 (|_im) .<br>
Also depending on the properties of the sheath of the optical fiber ribbon, in some cases, these properties affect the increase of the transmission loss and the branching operation efficiency at the live-line branching. It is preferable that the yield point stress, as the property of material of the sheath, falls within a range of 20MPa to 45Mpa. This is because that the branching operation can be performed easily and the transmission loss at the time of performing the live-line branching can be suppressed. In accordance with JIS K7113, the yield point stress is measured with respect to a No. 2 test piece at a tension speed of 50mm/minute. When the yield point stress is less than 20MPa, there arises a case in which the respective optical fibers are separated by an external force which is applied to the optical fibers during a step of assembling the optical fiber ribbons to form a cable and hence, the cable cannot be formed. On the other hand, when the yield point stress exceeds 45MPa, it is difficult to rupture the sheath and hence, the intermediate post branching of the optical fiber ribbon is hard to perform.<br>
Further, in this embodiment, with respect to the optical fiber cable 301 shown in Fig. 26A, the transmission loss value and the polarization mode dispersion (PMD) value at a wavelength of 1.55maremeasured. Further, an amount of increase (increment) of the transmission loss at the time of performing the intermediate post branching is measured.<br><br>
Here, the optical fiber ribbon used here is the optical fiber ribbon 110A shown in Fig. 13Aanda thickness T of the optical fiber ribbon is 270jim. The outer diameter d of the optical fiber 111A is 250^im. Further, the thickness t of the sheath is lOjjm and the depth Y of the recessed portions is 4 0|im. The thickness g of the optical fiber ribbon at the recessed portions is 190pm. However, among the optical fibers which are integrated as the optical fiber ribbon, 48 fibers are selected from optical fibers which conform to G652 and the remaining 48 fibers have the mold<br>
filed diameter of equal to or less than 10|im.<br>
With respect to the transmission loss value of the optical<br>
fibers in a state that they are housed in the optical fiber cable<br>
301, the optical fibers which conform toj3652 exhibit the maximum<br>
value of 0.23dB/km and the average value of 0.21dB/km, while the<br>
optical fibers whose mode field diameter is 10pm or less exhibit the maximum value of 0 * 21dB/km and the average value of 0 .20dB/km.<br>
Further, with respect to the polarization mode dispersion<br>
value, the optical fibers which conform to G652 exhibit the average<br>
value of 0.024 (ps/kmI/2) , the standard deviation of 0. 020 (ps/km1/2)<br>
and the link PMD of 0.045 (ps/km1/2) , while the optical fibers whose<br>
mode field diameter is 10pm or less exhibit the average value of 0.023 (ps/km1/2) , the standard deviation of 0. 019 (ps/km1/2) and<br>
the link PMD of 0.043 (ps/km1/2) .<br>
In this manner, with respect to the transmission loss and<br>
the PMD of the optical fibers after being formed into the cable,<br><br>
the optical fibers whose mode field diameter is lOpmor less exhibit the more favorable characteristics.<br>
Further, as mentioned above, the optical fiber cable which incorporates the optical fiber ribbons in the tubes and twists the tubes into SZ or the optical fiber cable which includes a single tube which is positioned at the center thereof and is not twisted exhibits the favorable intermediate post branching property. Accordingly, when this optical fiber cable is used as a subscriber-system communication path which connects between a station and an ordinary subscriber, the length of the optical fiber cable is, in many cases, shorter than the optical fiber cable for a relay system which connects stations and is several tens kmat the longest. However, when one optical fiber is allocated to one subscriber from the station to the subscribers, in case the number of the subscribers is large, the optical fiber cable capable of housing a large number of optical fibers becomes necessary and hence, the diameter of the optical fiber cable becomes large-sized. This situation is not favorable in installing the optical fiber cable in a conduit. Accordingly, the wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) technique which superposes signals of many subscribers in one optical fiber is effective and there exists a strong demand for an optical fiber cable which can transmit signals at a high speed.<br>
As in the case of the optical fiber cable according to the present invention, when the link PMD is equal to or less than<br><br>
0.2 (ps/knr7 ), the transmit table distance becomes 156km in case the transmission rate is 4G0Gbps and hence, it is possible to ensure a sufficient communication quantity to the subscriber system-Further, when link PMD is equal to or less than 0.1 (ps/km1/2) , the transmittable distance becomes 625km in case the transmission rate is 40Gbps and the transmittable distance becomes 156km in case the transmission rate is 8 0Gbps and hence, it is more preferable.<br>
Here, the method for measuring the transmission loss by performing the intermediate post branching from the optical fiber cable is explained in conjunction with Fig. 23.<br>
First of all, as shown in Fig. 23, out of an arbitrary optical fiber-ribbon in a tube, a light source 220 for allowing<br>
the incidence of light having a wavelength of 1.55(im into a first optical fiber 11a is connected to the optical fiber 11a at one side of the optical fiber cable 301, while a light receiver 221* and a storage oscilloscope 222 are connected to the optical fiber 11a at the other side of the optical fiber cable 301.  In this<br>
state, the light having a wavelength of 1.55jam is incident on the first optical fiber 11a from the light source 220. The incident<br>
light is transmitted to the other side of the optical fiber 11a and is received by the receiver 221. An received light quantity of the received light is observed by the storage oscilloscope 222 at proper times.<br><br>
Then, in a state that the incidence of light from the light source 22 0 is continued, the sheath and the press winding are removed at an intermediate portion of the optical fiber cable 301 by a length of approximately 500mm. The tube including the optical fiber 11a on which the light from the light source is incident is taken out by making use of the inverting portion of twisting. Further, the tube coating at the intrermediate portion is removed using a tube cutter and the optical fiber ribbon 10c is taken out. Then, the optical fiber ribbon 10c is branched into a plurality of single fibers and a fourth fiber lib is cut. Here, the method for branching the optical fiber ribbon 10c is performed in accordance with the above-mentioned steps explained in conjunction with Fig. 2A to Fig. 2C.<br>
The measurement of the transmission loss is performed by observing the steps ranging from the removal of the sheath from the optical fiber cable 301 to the completion of the operation using the storage oscilloscope 222.<br>
As a result, with respect to an increased amount of transmission loss during the operation, a value equal to or more than 1.OdB is not recognized in the optical fibers which conform to G652, while a value equal to or more than 0.5dB is not recognized in the optical fibers which has the mode field diameter of equal<br>
to or less than lOjim.<br>
Next, a central tube type optical fiber cable which constitutes another modification of the optical fiber cable<br><br>
according to the second embodiment of the present invention is explained- Here, the parts which are common with parts of the previously-mentioned loose tube type optical fiber cable 301 are indicated by same symbols and the repeated explanation of these parts is omitted. Fig. 27Ais a cross-sectional viewof the optical fiber cable of a type in which optical fiber ribbons are incorporated in one tube positioned at the center of the optical fiber cable and a jelly is filled in the tube, Fig. 27B is a cross-sectional view of the 24-fibered optical fiber ribbons and Fig. 28 is a cross-sectional view of an optical fiber cable of - a yarn filled type.<br>
In the jelly-filled-type optical fiber cable 301A shown in Fig. 27A is configured such that 24 pieces of optical fibers<br>
11 having an outer diameter of 250|im which conform to G652 are arranged in parallel in a state that they are brought into contact with each other/the optical fibers are covered with an ultraviolet ray curable resin so as to form a 24*-fibered optical fiber ribbon shown in Fig. 27B, and 18 pieces of these optical fiber ribbons 31 Od are stacked to form a stacked body 30 9A. Here, the 24-fibered optical fiber ribbon has a width w of 6.1mm and a thickness T of 270|im, while a thickness t of a sheath thereof is lOjam. Further, a depth Y of recessed portions is 40|am and a thickness g of the optical fiber ribbon 310d at the recessed portions is 190nin. By twisting the stacked body 109A in one direction at a pitch of 1000mm, the stacked body 109A is housed in a plastic tube 308A<br><br>
made of polybutylene terephthalate (PBT) which has an outer diameter of 14mm and an inner diameter of 10mm. Then, jelly 307A is filled in the inside of the plastic tube 308A.<br>
To the outside of the plastic tube 308A, tensile strength bodies 306A (for example, G-FRP having an outer diameter of 1.5mm) are attached such that three tensile strength bodies 306A extend in the longitudinal direction along each of left and right sides. A sheath 303A which is made of polyethylene and has a thickness of 2 .5mm is formed on the outside of the above-mentioned structure. Here, a tearing string 305A which is served for tearing the sheath 303Ais provided along the tensile strength bodies 3 06A in parallel. Due to such a constitution, the optical fiber cable can have the favorable properties such that the transmission loss after forming<br>
into a cable is 0.25 dB/km or less at a wavelength of 1.55nm and a link PMD is 0.05ps/km1/2. Further, the increase of the transmission loss at the intermediate post branching experiment can be suppressed to 1.OdB or less in the same manner as the above-mentioned optical fiber cable 301.<br>
Further, as shown in Fig. 28, the yarn-filled-type optical fiber cable 301B forms a stacked body 309B by laminating 6 sheets of 4-fibered optical fiber ribbons having recessed portions as shown in Fig. 13A. The 4-fibered optical fiber ribbons has a thickness T of 270(jm and a sheath thickness t of lOjom. Further, a depth Y of the recessed portions is 30|jm and a thickness g of the optical fiber ribbon at the recessed portions is 210jim. The<br><br>
stacked body 309B is twisted in one direction together with a yarn 322 which constitutes a filler and they are covered with polyethylene together with tensile strength bodies 306B, support lines 323 and the like in a peanut shape. Although the explanation is made with respect to the yarn-filled optical fiber cable adopting one-direction twisting, the modification is not limited to one-direction twisting and is applicable to the optical fiber cable adopting the SZ direction twisting. Here, in the inside of the sheath 303B, a tearing string 305B which is served for tearing the sheath 303B is provided. Due to such a constitution, the optical fiber cable can have the favorable properties such that the transmission loss after forming into a cable is 0.25<br>
dB/km or less at a wavelength of 1. 55pirt and a link PMD is 0. lps/km1/2 or less. Further, the increase of the transmission loss at the intermediate po~st branching experiment can be suppressed to 1. OdB or less with respect to the optical fibers which conform to G652 and to 0.5dB or less with respect to the optical fibers which<br>
has the mode field diameter of 10|jm or less in the same manner as the above-mentioned optical fiber cable 301.<br>
In this manner, the optical fiber cable whose increase of loss at the time of performing the intermediate post branching is 1.OdB or less can favorably perform the intermediate post branching in a live-line state andhence, it is possible to properly take out only the desired optical fiber by branching and to use other optical fibers at the downstream side. Accordingly, it<br><br>
is possible to effectively make use of all optical fibers housed in the optical fiber cable. Accordingly, the construction cost of the communication line can be suppressed to a low level.<br>
Further, the optical fiber cable whose increase of loss at the time of performing the intermediate post branching is 0. 5dB or less can take out the desired optical fiber even when the high-speed communication is performed using the optical fiber which is not branched or even when the communication is performed in an area where the dynamic range is small. Accordingly, the degree of freedom in designing the optical communication system is remarkably enhanced.<br>
An optical fiber cable according to the third embodiment of the present invention is explained in conjunction with Fig. 29 to Fig. 38.<br>
The optical fiber cable 401 shown in Fig. 29 is an optical fiber cable which is used as a drop cable. The optical fiber cable 401 is configured such that an element portion 409 and a messenger wire portion 408 are connected by means of a neck portion 406.<br>
In the element portion 409, an optical fiber ribbon 410 which is arranged at the center of the element portion 409 and two tensile strength bodies 402 are integrally formed by covering them with a sheath 403 made of a thermoplastic resin. The optical fiber ribbon 410 and two tensile strength bodies 402 are covered by the sheath 403 such that they are adhered to each other. As<br><br>
the thermoplastic resin, a nonflammable polyethylene or PVC can be suitably used.<br>
Two tensile strength bodies 402 are arranged in parallel on a coplanar face with the optical fiber ribbon 410 such that the optical fiber ribbon 410 is arranged between two tensile strength bodies 402.<br>
The tensile strength bodies 402 are formed of a glass FRP or a steel wire and a profile of cross section has a circular shape.<br>
Further, it is preferable to provide an adhesive layer (not shown in the drawing), on an outer periphery of the tensile • strength body 402 made of glass FRP. In this case, the tensile strength bodies 402 and the sheath 403 are strongly adhered to each other. As a material of the adhesive layer, polyethylene is suitably used.<br>
In this manner, by collectively covering the optical fiber ribbon 410 and the tensile strength bodies 402, the tensile strength bodies 402 receive an external force such as a tension applied to the element portion 409 so as to protect the optical fiber ribbon 410 from the external force.<br>
Further, in the outer periphery of the element portion<br>
409,	two notches 404 are formed such that these notches 404 are<br>
directed to the optical fiber ribbon 410. The notches 404 are<br>
provided for facilitating the removal of the optical fiber ribbon<br>
410.	At the time of taking out the optical fiber ribbon 410,<br><br>
a cut is formed in the sheath 403 between two notches 404 and the sheath 403 is torn.<br>
The messenger wire portion 408 is configured such that the messenger wire portion 4 08 has a strength to support the optical fiber cable 401 overhead and is formed by covering a support line 407 made of steel, FRP or the like with the sheath 403 made of thermoplastic resin. Further, an adhesive layer 405 is formed on an outer periphery of the support line 407 so as to strongly adhere the support line 407 and the sheath 403 to each other. Further, in the neck portion 406, the element portion 409 and the messenger wire portion 408 are integrally formed of the same resin as the sheath 403 of the element portion 409 and the messenger wire portion 408. At this neck portion 406, when the element portion 409 and themessengerwireportion 408 are separated, the element portion 409"and the messenger wire portion 408 can be easily torn apart using a hand or fingers.<br>
As the-optical fiber ribbon 410 which is housed in the optical fiber cable according to the present invention, an optical fiber ribbon 10 which is similar to the optical fiber ribbons of the above-mentioned first and the second embodiment can be named. That is, as shown in Fig. 1A, for example, in the optical fiber ribbon410, aplurality (four in this embodiment, for example) of optical fibers 11 are arranged in parallel and the whole outer peripheries of the optical fibers 11 which are arranged in parallel are integrally covered with the sheath 12 over the whole length<br><br>
of the optical fibers 11. With respect to the detailed structure and the characteristics of the optical fiber ribbon 410, the detailed explanations are omitted.<br>
In the optical fiber ribbon 410 of this embodiment/ the thickness of the sheath 12 is set smaller than the thickness of a sheath 12 of an optical fiber ribbon which has been used in the related art. Here, assuming the maximum value of the thickness of the optical fiber ribbon 410 as T(|xm) and the outer diameter of the optical fiber 11 as d(|am), the thickness t of the sheath 12 can be calculated based on a formula t= (T-d) /2 . In the optical fiber ribbon 410, the thickness t of the sheath 12 is set such<br>
that the thickness satisfies T<d that is the thickness t of sheath becomes equal to or less than></d>
With the use of the optical fiber ribbon 410 having thin<br>
sheath 12, the optical fiber cable 401 from which an intermediate<br>
optical fiber ribbon can be taken out extremely easily can be<br>
obtained at low cost.	* *<br>
In this manner, in the optical fiber ribbon 410, since the thickness t of the sheath 12 is^small, the resin 112 can be easily started to be peeled off by generating cracks or peeling in the sheath 12 manually by an operator or using a branching tool. Accordingly, the optical fiber 11 can be easily branched by peeling off the sheath 12 from the optical fiber ribbon 410. That is, the optical fiber ribbon 410 has the structure which facilitates the intermediate post branching operation.<br><br>
Further, the method for performing the intermediate post branching is performed in accordance with the above-mentioned steps which have been explained in conjunction with Fig. 2A-2C<br>
Here, the relationship between the operability of the<br>
intermediate post branching and the live-line loss increase at<br>
the time of performing such branching which differs depending<br>
on the difference in thickness t of the sheath 12 is shown in<br>
Table 26. Further, Table 26 shows the result of the separation<br>
experiment showing the strength of integrity of the optical fibers.<br>
Here, the outer diameter d of the optical fibers of the optical<br>
fiber ribbon shown in Table 26 is 250fim. Further, the Young's modulus of the resin which constitutes the sheath 12 is 900MPa.<br><br>
Here, the optical fiber ribbon with the sheath having the thickness t of 0.0 in Table 2 6 indicates the optical fiber ribbon in which the resin does not cover the whole optical fibers as shown in Fig. 10.<br>
The intermediate post branching property shown in Table<br><br>
26 indicates the easiness in branching the intermediate portion of the optical fiber ribbon into respective optical fibers while suppressing the increase of the transmission loss to a value equal to or less than 1. OdB. As criteria for evaluation in this specification, "very good" indicates that the branching can be performed within 2 minutes on average, "good" indicates that the branching can be performed over two minutes and within 3 minutes on average and "fair" indicates that the branching can be performed over 3 minutes and within 5 minutes on average. Further, "no good" indicates that the branching operation takes more than 5 minutes on average.<br>
Further, when the increase of the transmission loss at the time of branching is equal to or less than l.OdB, it means that the live-line branching can be performed.<br>
Here, the experiment on the intermediate post branching property is explained.<br>
First, as shown in Fig. 30A, the sheath at the both ends of the optical fiber cable 410 is removed by approximately 1m at each end and, then, the optical fiber ribbon 410 is taken out. Then, both ends of the optical fiber ribbon 410 are respectively separated into single fibers and a light source 420 for emitting<br>
light having a wavelength of 1.55(im is connected to the optical fiber 11a of the primary fiber on one side and a light receiving device 421 and a storage oscilloscope 422 are connected to the optical fiber 11a of the primary fiber at the other side. In<br><br>
this state, light having a wavelength of 1,55pm is emitted from the light source 420 and is incident on the optical fiber 11a of the primary fiber. The incident light is transmitted to the other side of the optical fiber 11a and is received by the light receiver 421. An amount of the received light is observed by the storage oscilloscope 422 at proper times.<br>
Then, in a state that the incidence of the light from the<br>
light source 420 is continued, as shown in Fig. 30B, the sheath<br>
is removed by making use of the notches at the intermediate portion<br>
of the optical fiber cable 401 by approximately 50cm. The optical<br>
fiber ribbon 410 is taken out and the intermediate post branching<br>
of the optical fiber ribbon 410 is performed. That is, the optical<br>
fiber ribbon 410 is branched into single fibers in a state that<br>
the first optical fiber 11a is in a live-line state (live-line<br>
branching) . At this time, the increase amount of the transmission<br>
loss brought about by the intermediate post branching is measured<br>
by the storage oscilloscope 422.	- *<br>
Here, the length of the portion for the intermediate post branching is set to 40cm. Further, the method for performing the intermediate post branching is performed in accordance with the above-mentioned steps whichhavebeen explained in conjunction with Fig. 2A-2C.<br>
Among the optical fiber ribbons shown in Table 2 6, the optical fiber ribbons whose intermediate post branching property is "very good", "good" or "fair" have the ribbon thicknesses T<br><br>
which is equal to or less than 290join, that is, T<d . in each of these optical fiber ribbons the intermediate post branching can be performed within minutes while suppressing increase transmission loss at time to a value equal or less than l.odb. that is live-line minutes.></d>
On the other hand, with respect to the optical fiber ribbons available in the related art having a thick sheath in which the ribbon thickness T exceeds the outer diameter d of the optical<br>
fiber by more than 40}am, the evaluation of the intermediate post branching property is "no good". The increase amount of the transmission loss at the time of branching exceeds l.OdB or, even when the branching can be performed, the time necessary for branching exceeds 5 minutes and hence, the live-line branching cannot be performed actually.<br>
The live-line loss increase shown inTable26 is the increase amount of the transmission loss which is generated during the intermediate post branching operation. As criteria for evaluation in this specification, "very good" indicates that the transmission loss does not increase by more than O.ldB during the branching operation, "good" indicates that the transmission loss does not increase by more than 0.5dB during the branching operation and "fair" indicates that the transmission loss does not increase by more than l.OdB during the branching operation. Further, "no good" indicates that the increase amount of the<br><br>
transmission loss exceeds by more than 1. OdB during the branching operation.<br>
Among the optical fiber ribbons shown in Table 2 6, the optical fiber ribbons whose live-line loss increase is "very good", "good" or "fair" have ribbon thicknesses T equal to or less than<br>
290(im, that is, T<d . in each of these optical fiber ribbons the intermediate post branching live-line can be performed while suppressing increase transmission loss at time to a value equal or less than l.odb. among having ribbon thickness t that is are more preferable since evaluation on and amount further suppressed low level.></d>
On the other hand, with respect to the-optical fiber ribbons available in the related art having a thick resin in which the ribbon thickness T exceeds the outer diameter d of the optical<br>
fibers by more than 40\m, the evaluation on the live-line loss increase is "not good" and the increase an amount of the transmission loss exceeds l.OdB during the branching operation.<br>
The presence and non-presence of fiber separation shown in Table 2 6 show the result of separation experiment showing the strength of integrity of the optical fiber.<br>
Here, the separation experiment is performed in accordance with the steps shown in Fig. 22.<br><br>
As criteria for evaluation of the tiJDer separaLAuu J.I± W^-specification, "good" indicates a case in which there is no separation between the optical fiber and the resin and the optical fiber ribbon remains integrally formed in a lengthwise direction and "no good" indicates a case in which areas where the optical fiber and the resin are separated are generated.<br>
Among the optical fiber ribbons shown in Table 26, when<br>
the thickness T satisfies T&gt;d+1 (pin), the separation between the optical fiber ribbons is not generated and hence is favorable.<br>
That is, it is understood that when the thickness t of the resin<br>
is equal or more than 0.5pm, enough strength which can keep the respective optical fibers integrated to each other can be obtained. Among the optical fiber ribbons shown in Table 26, when the thickness T assumes T=d (see Fig. 10), although separation area is generated in this separation experiment, by controlling such that, the external power such as ironing or the like which' is applied on the optical fiber ribbon in the manufacturing line of the optical fiber cable is reduced, drawbacks such as the generation of the separation of the ribbons during the manufacturing process of the cable can be prevented. Further, in this optical fiber ribbon in which the thickness T assumes T=d, because the sheath is practically disconnected at the areas in the thickness direction of the optical fiber ribbon which passes through the center of the respective optical fibers, the respective optical fibers are easily separated in the widthwise direction<br><br>
of the optical fiber ribbon and hence, compared to the optical fiber ribbons which are configured such that the whole of the respective optical fibers are covered with the sheath, the intermediate post branching property is favorable.<br>
Further, in the optical fiber ribbon 10A in which the whole of the respective optical fibers 11A are not covered with the resin 12aA as shown in Fig. 10, the respective fiber 11A is integrally formed using only the adhesive strength between the resin 12aA and the optical fiber. On the other hand, the optical fiber ribbon 10 shown in Fig. 1A, because the resin covers the whole of the respective optical fibers 11 integrally as the sheath 12, not only by the adhesive strength between the resin and the optical fiber, but also by the strength with which the sheath 12 itself tries to hold its shape, the state in which the whole of the optical fiber ribbon 10 is integrated can be easily maintained.<br>
'Nfext, another preferred mode of the optical fiber ribbon which is housed in an optical fiber cable according to the third embodiment of the present invention is explained.<br>
As shown in Fig. 11A, in the optical fiber ribbon 410, with respect to the sheath 112 which covers the optical fibers 141, eachrecessedportionll6 is formed in the sheath corresponding to each indentation formed between the neighboring optical fibers 111, 111. In the recessed portion 116, the bottom portion 117 is formed as a portion where the indentation is largest. With<br><br>
respect to the detailed constitution and the characteristics<br>
regarding the optical fiber ribbon 410b, the detailed description<br>
is omitted.<br>
As mentioned above, it is favorable that the thickness<br>
of the sheath which is formed on the periphery of the optical<br>
fiber 11 is preferably small from a viewpoint of reduction of<br>
the increase of the live-line loss and it is more preferable that<br>
the thickness of the sheath 12 is approximately 0. 5|xrci. However, in manufacturing such an optical fiber ribbon actually, it is<br>
preferable that a certain degree of thickness is ensured.  The<br>
reason is that in an attempt to make the thickness of the resin<br>
which constitutes the resin thin, there is a possibility that<br>
the resin is not applied partially (this phenomenon being referred<br>
to as "shortage of resin". Accordingly, it is preferable to form<br>
the resin having a thickness of 2. 5^tm or more with respect to the optical fibers 111.  In this case, to reduce an amount of the resin in the thickness direction of the optical fiber ribbon while ensuring a given resin thickness, the resin formed between the indentation of the neighboring optical fibers may be reduced. Portions where the shortage of resin occurs are portions where the outer diameter of the optical fiber assumes the largest value in the thickness direction of the optical fiber ribbon and hence, the reduction of an amount of the resin between the neighboring optical fibers does not obstruct the reliable coating of the resin. Accordingly, the formation of the recessed portions 116<br><br>
as shown in Fig. 11A can suppress the increase of the live-line loss at the time of performing the intermediate post branching while preventing the shortage of resin.<br>
Further, as the optical fiber ribbon which is housed in the optical fiber cable of this embodiment, an optical fiber ribbon 110A shown in Fig. 13A which is a mode obtained by partially modifying the constitution of the optical fiber ribbon 110 shown in Fig. 11A is named.<br>
Here, with respect to the depth of the recessed portions formed in the resin shown in Fig. 11A and Fig. 13, the prevention of separation of the optical fiber at the time of manufacturing the optical fiber ribbon by arranging a plurality of optical fibers in parallel and by integrating them using a resin, the prevention of peeling-off (becoming a cause of separation of the optical fibers) at the time of performing the installation operation of the optical fiber ribbon, or the increase or decrease of transmission loss during the favorable branching operation or the live-line branching are reviewed. As a result, it is preferable that the recessed portions are formed such that the recessed portions do not exceed a common tangent line which is f ormedby the neighboring optical fibers . That is, it is favorable that the recessed portions are formed at the inner side than the common tangent.<br>
The result of the review is specifically explained hereinafter.<br><br>
With respect to cases in which the thickness T(|im) of the optical fiber ribbon is set to 270|im, 280JJHI and 290(jm, a ratio t/Y which is a ratio of the thickness t(pm) of the resin with respect to the depth Y(nm) of the recessed portion and a ratio g/d which is a ratio of thickness g (|im) of the optical fiber ribbon at the recessed portion with respect to the outer diameter(^m) of the optical fiber when the depth d of the recessed portion differs are calculated, and the intermediate post branching property, and the increase of live-line loss a for respective cases are reviewed.<br>
The relationship between the intermediate post branching<br>
property and the live-line loss increase when the thickness T<br>
of the optical fiber ribbon is 270^m is shown in Table 27. Here, the ratio (T-d)/2Y in the table has the same value as t/Y.<br><br><br>
The relationship between the intermediate post branching property and the live-line loss increase when the thickness T of the optical fiber ribbon is 280|om is shown in Table 28.<br><br><br>
The relationship between the intermediate post branching property and the live-line loss increase when the thickness T of the optical fiber ribbon is 290[im ■* «* ^^ ^ T^HI o 9Q<br><br>
1 ■	■	....<br>
As shown in Table 27 to Table 29, with respect to both of the intermediate post branching property and the live-line loss increase, the better result is obtained as the depth Y of the recessed portion increases.<br>
Further, when the thickness T of the optical fiber ribbon<br>
is 270(jiaor 28 0pm, that is, T<d the result of live-line loss increase is especially favorable. it can be considered that this because when a branching tool as shown in fig. used due to advantageous effect recessed portions property improved compared optical fiber ribbon whose resin merely formed thin. for example></d>
ribbon thickness T assumes 270|imshown in Table 27, the intermediate post branching property is "'good", while when the ribbon thickness<br>
T assumes 280(im and the depth Y of the recessed portion assumes 5(im shown in Table 29, the intermediate post branching property is "very good". Accordingly, the effect of the recessed portions<br><br>
is confirmed.<br>
Further^ it is understood that when focusing on the intermediate post branching property, the intermediate post branching property is especially associated with the value of the ratio (T-d)/2Y. For example, when the ration (T-d)/2Y is equal to or less than 4 . 0, the intermediate post branching property is good.<br>
Further, when the ration g/d is equal to or less than 1.0, that is, when the bottom portion of the recessed portion is located at the inner side of the common tangent of the optical fibers, the intermediate post branching property is good and the live-line loss increase becomes low, and when the ratio g/d is equal to or less than 1. 0, the advantageous effect is further distinguished.<br>
It is favorable that, in the optical fiber ribbon on which the recessed portion is formed as shown in Fig. 11A or Fig. 13A, the recessed portion is formed in a smooth curved shape R. For example, it is because, when the recessed portion has the bottom* portion having the pointed shape in conformity with the shape of the optical fiber ribbon, the stress concentrates on the bottom portion and hence, it becomes to easily generate cracks and fractures.<br>
Further, as shown in Fig. 1A, Fig. 10, Fig. 11A, Fig. 13A, in the optical fiber ribbon which is used in the optical fiber cable of the present invention, the adhesive strength between the optical fiber and the sheath (resin) sometimes affects the<br><br>
increase of transmission loss and the branching operability at the live-line branching. With respect to the adhesive strength of the optical fiber and the resin, considering the prevention of the increase of transmission loss and the branching operability, it is favorable that the adhesive strength per one optical fiber is within a range of 0.245(mN) to 2.45(mN). When the above-mentioned adhesive strength is smaller than the above-mentioned region, it sometimes happens that the sheath (resin) is broken when forming the cable and the respective optical fibers are separated. Further, when the above-mentioned adhesive strength is larger than the above-mentioned region, the branching property is deteriorated.<br>
The adhesive strength between the optical fiber and the resin can be measured by the method which has been explained above in conjunction with Fig. 5 and 6.<br>
In the optical fiber ribbon which is used in the present<br>
invention, when the main object is that the optical fibers keep<br>
the integrality without being separated from each other, it is<br>
favorable that the thickness of the resin is equal to or more<br>
than 0 . 5\xm. and, in this case, the maximum thickness T of the optical<br>
fiber ribbon becomes T&gt; outer diameter d of the optical fiber<br>
+ 1 (jim) .<br>
Further, properties of the resin of the optical fiber ribbon<br>
also sometimes affect the increase of the^transmission loss or<br>
the branching operability at the live-line branching.  With<br><br>
respect to the material properties of the resin, it is favorable that the yield point stress is within a range of 20MPa to 45MPa and the branching operation tan be easily performed as well as the transmission loss at the time cf live-line branching can be suppressed. The yield point stress is measured in conformity with CIS K7113 using a No.2 test piece at a tension speed of 50mm/minute. When the yield point stress is less than 20MPa, it sometimes happens that the respective optical fibers are separated by an external stress which is applied in the steps for forming the optical fiber ribbon into a cable and hence, the optical fiber ribbon cannot be formed into a cable. When the yield point stress exceeds 45MPa, it is difficult to break the resin and the intermediate post branching of the optical fiber ribbon is difficult to be performed.<br>
Further, here, with respect to the optical fiber cable 4 01 shewn in Fig. 29, the value of the transmission loss in the<br>
ordinary condition with a wavelength of 1.55pin and the increase amount cf the transmission less of the intermediate post branching are measured.<br>
Here, the optical fiber carle 4 01 used in this embodiment has the whole 'width of 6.0mm, a thickness of 2.0mm,, while a support line 7 and a tensile strength body 402 are made of a steel wire.<br>
Further, the optical fiber iihbc-r. which is used in this embodiment is the optical fiber ribbon 110A shown in Fig. ISA and a thickness T thereof is 2~0pm. The outer diameter d of the<br><br>
optical fiber 11 is 250j.im. further, the thickness t of the resin is 10)am and the depth of the recessed portions is 50p.ru. However, as the optical fibers which are integrated as the optical fiber ribbon, a case in which the optical fibers which conform to G652 are used and a case in which the optical fibers having the mode<br>
field diameter equal to or less than IOJJITI are used are provided and the results of the measurement by comparing respective cases are provided.<br>
With respect to the value of the transmission loss of the optical fibers in the condition that the optical fibers are covered with the cable sheath 403 as the optical fiber cable 401, when the optical fibers conforming to G652 are used, the maximum value is 0 . 22d3/km and the average value is 0 . 20dB/km. When the optical<br>
fiber having the mode field diameter equal to or less than lOum are used, the maximum value is 0.21dB/km and the average value is 0.19dB/km.<br>
In this manner, with respect to the transmission loss of the optical fibers in a state that the optical fibers are formed into the cable, the optical fibers having the mode field diameter<br>
equal to or less than lOjim exhibit the particularly favorable property.<br>
Further, in accordance with the method shown in Fig . 30A-303,<br>
the intermediate pest branching is performed on the optical fiber<br>
cable so as to measure the transmission loss thereof.<br>
The transmission loss is measured by observing the<br><br>
operation from a point of time the sheath 403 is removed from the optical fiber cable 401 10 the completion of the intermediate post branching using the storage oscilloscope 422.<br>
As a result, with respect to the increase amount of the transmission loss during the operation, in both of the case in which the optical fibers conforming to G652 is used and the case in which the optical fibers having the mode field diameter of<br>
equal to or less than lOfim is used, values which are equal to or more than O.ldB cannot be recognized.<br>
In this manner, the optical fiber cable which exhibits the increase of the loss amounting to a value equal to or less than 1. OdB at the time of performing the intermediate post branching can perform the intermediate pest branching in the live-line condition favorably and hence, only the desired optical fibers can be appropriately branched and be taken out and other optical fibers can be used in the downstream side. Accordingly, all of the* Optical fibers housed in the optical fiber able can be effectively used. Accordingly, "he construction cost of the communication line can be suppressed to a low level.<br>
Further, with respect to the optical fiber cable which can suppress the increase of transmission loss at the time of intermediate post branching tc a value equal to or less than 0. 5dB, even when the high speed communication is performed through the optical fibers with no branching cr even when the communication is performed in a region having a small dynamic range, desired<br><br>
optical fibers can be branched and taken out. Accordingly, the design flexibility of the optical communication network can be remarkably enhanced.<br>
Next, the optical fiber cable of another mode according to the present invention is explained.<br>
An optical fiber cable 430 which is shown in Fig. 31 is provided with neither the support line 407 nor the tensile strength body 4 02 which are shown in Fig. 29. In the optical fiber cable 430, an optical fiber ribbon 410 is covered with a sheath 403 made of a thermoplastic resin and two notches 4 04 are formed in a sheath 4 03.<br>
An optical fiber cable 431 which is shown in Fig. 32 is constituted of two optical fiber ribbons 410, two tensile strength bodies 402 and a sheath 403. Two optical fiber ribbons 410 are arranged between two tensile strength bodies 402 in a state that two optical fiber ribbons are stacked in contact with each other in the thickness direction and is covered with a sheath 403 together with two tensile strength bodies 4 02. Further, two notches 4 04 are formed in the sheath 4.03.<br>
In an optical fiber cable 432 which is shown in Fig. 33, an optical fiber ribbon 410 and two tensile strength bodies 4 02 are covered with a sheath 4 03a having a substantially circular contour.  Two notches 4 04 are also formed in the sheath 4 03a.<br>
In an optical fiber cable 433 shown in Fig. 34, an optical fiber ribbon 410 and two tensile strength bodies 402 are covered<br><br>
with a sheath 4 03b having a circular contour. Although no notch<br>
•f<br>
is formed in the sheath 403b, two rearing strings 434 for tearing<br>
off the sheath 4 03b are mounted in the neighborhood of the optical fiber ribbon 410. When the optical fiber ribbon 410 is taken out, by pulling these tearing strings 434 to the outside of the sheath 403b in directions opposite to each other, the sheath 403b can be torn.<br>
An optical fiber cable 435 which is shown in Fig. 35 is constituted of an optical fiber ribbon 410, two tensile strength bodies 4 02 and a sheath 4 03. Two notches 4 04 which are formed in the sheath 403 are not formed on the same area in the thickness direction and on the center in the widthwise direction of the optical fiber ribbon 410 but the respective notches 4 04 are formed toward the end portions of the widthwise direction of the optical fiber ribbon 410. In this manner, by forming two notches 4 04 on asymmetrical positions, when the sheath 403 is torn from these notches 404, the optical fiber ribbon can be easily.taken out due to such a constitution.<br>
In an optical fiber cable 43c shown in Fig. 36, similar to the optical fiber cable 431 shown in Fig. 32, two optical fiber ribbons 410 are coveredwith a sheath 401 together with two tensile strength bodies 402. However, tv:c optical fiber ribbons 410 are housed in a housing hole 437 v;hien is formed in the sheath 403 and are not completely brought into contact with the sheath 403. That is, between the optical fioer ribbons 410 and the sheath<br><br>
403, an inner cavity 438 cf a housing hole 437 is mounted. In this case, when the optical fiber cable 436 is bent cr is twisted,-because the optical fiber ribbons 410 are not always deformed together with the sheath 4C3, the increase cf transmission loss can be suppressed to a low level. Further, when the optical fiber ribbons 410 are taken out by "earing the sheath 403 from the notch 4 04, the frictional force caused by the displacement of the sheath is not applied directly to the optical fiber ribbons 410 and hence, an undesired separation cf the optical fiber ribbons 410 can be prevented.<br>
Further, like an optical fiber cable 439 shown in Fig. 37, in a housing hole 437, a separator 440 can be mounted together with the optical fiber ribbons 410. Here, the separator 440 may be, for example, an separator which can decrease the frictional resistance between the optical fiber ribbon 410 and the sheath 403 such as oil, talc or the like, or may be a fiber-type yarn which is forxrred of polypropylene or the like having a function as a tensile strength body.<br>
Further, like an optical fiber cable 441 which is shown in Fig. 38, 'without forming a housing hole, a ribbon-shaped intermediate 440a which is arranged such that the intermediate 440a lies along the optical fiber ribbon 410 may be mounted.<br>
As explained above, with respect to the optical fiber cable according to the present invention, examples of various aspects can be shown.<br><br>
Here; as the optical fiber ribbons of the optical"fiber cables 430, 431, 432, 433, 435, 436, 439, 441, other than the optical fiber ribbon 10 which is shown in the drawing, the above-mentioned optical fiber ribbons 10A, 110, 110A can be used.<br>
Further, as the resir. of the sheath of the cable covering over the optical fiber ribbon, thermosetting resin can be used. Further, for reducing the weight or improving the tearing property at the time of taking out the optical fiber ribbon, the resin of the sheath may be foamed.<br>
Herein, the optical fiber ribbon as shown in Fig. 13, according to the present invention, is not limited to satisfy<br>
the relationship T 
may not exceed a common tangent of the neighboring optical fibers.<br>
In this optical fibber ribbon with such a structure, when the optical fibers are branched from the integrated optical fiber ribbon, it is possible to easily branch the optical fibbers because the sheath which covers the recessed portion between the optical fibers does not exceed the common tangent of the optical fibers.<br>
As explained above, in the optical fiber ribbons according to the present invention, the optical fiber ribbon can be kept without separating each other when the optical fiber ribbon is formed in a cable and the respective optical fibers can be easily branched.<br>
As explained above, by means of the optical fiber cable<br><br>
according to che present invention, the intermediate post branching of the optical f iber ribbon which is housed in the optical fiber cable can be easily performed.<br>
As explained above, by means of the optical fiber cable according to che present invention, the intermediate post branching of the optical fiber ribbon which is housed in the optical fiber cable can be easily performed and the PMD can be decreased.<br><br><br><br>
