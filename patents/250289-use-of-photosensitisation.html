				<td>USE OF PHOTOSENSITISATION<br>
The present invention relates to a composition comprising a conjugate of a<br>
photosensitiser and a bacteriophage, particularly a staphylococcal bacteriophage,<br>
known as a staphylophage. The invention also relates to the use of the conjugate in a<br>
method of photodynamic therapy for infectious diseases.<br>
Background<br>
The use of antimicrobial agents to counter bacterial infections is becoming<br>
increasingly ineffective, due to the rapid emergence of antibiotic resistance amongst<br>
many species of pathogenic bacteria. One such pathogen is Staphylococcus aureus (S.<br>
aureus), which characteristically causes skin infections such as boils, carbuncles and<br>
impetigo, as well as infecting acne, bums and wounds. If the infecting organism is a<br>
toxic strain, such infections, or colonised tampons, may give rise to a life-threatening<br>
toxaemia known as toxic shock syndrome. The organism may also gain access to the<br>
bloodstream from these infections, or from foreign bodies such as intravenous<br>
catheters, and so cause infections at other sites, such as endocarditis, osteomyelitis,<br>
meningitis and pneumonia.<br>
A number of bacteria are responsible for infection of skin and wounds, for<br>
example, coagulase-negative staphylococci, Staphylococcus aureus, streptococci,<br>
Corynebacterium spp., E. coli, Klebsiella aerogenes, Klebsiella pneumoniae,<br>
Enterobacter aerogenes, Propionibacterium acnes, Bacteroides spp., Pseudomonas<br>
aeruginosa and Peptostreptococcus spp. Increasingly, these bacteria are showing<br>
resistance to antibiotic treatment.<br>
In particular, resistant strains of 5. aureus have emerged. Methicillin-resistant<br>
S. aureus (MRSA) was first reported in 1961 (Jevons, M. (1961) British Medical<br>
Journal, 1, 124-5), and these strains are now a major cause of hospital-acquired<br>
infection throughout the world, as well as being prevalent in many nursing and<br>
residential homes. This poses an alarming challenge to healthcare, causing significant<br>
infection and morbidity of hundreds of patients in the UK each year (Ayliffe et al, J<br>
Hosp Infect (1988), 39, 253-90).<br>
Since the first report of MRS A, these organisms have demonstrated resistance<br>
to a wide variety of antimicrobials including erythromycin, aminoglycosides,<br>
tetracyclines, trimethoprim, sulphonamides and chloramphenicol. MRSA strains<br>
have developed that are only susceptible to a single class of clinically-available<br>
antibiotics: the glycopeptides such as vancomycin and teicoplanin. However,<br>
resistance is developing even to these, as strains tolerant to vancomycin have now<br>
been reported (Hiramatsu, K. (1998) American Journal of Medicine, 104, 7S - 10S).<br>
These strains are variously known as VRS A (Vancomycin resistant Staphylococcus<br>
aureus) and hetero-VRSA (resistant strains arising from exposure to high levels of<br>
vancomycin). At present, the management of patients with MRSA infections usually<br>
involves the administration of antimicrobial agents and again, there is evidence of the<br>
development of resistance to many of the agents used.<br>
Due to the emergence of strains which are resistant to virtually all currentlyavailable<br>
antimicrobials, MRSA is now a serious threat to health. The term MRSA<br>
itself now more accurately applies to methicillin and multiple antimicrobial-resistant<br>
S. aureus.<br>
Certain strains of MRSA have been found to spread rapidly not only within<br>
hospitals, but also between them. These strains have been termed epidemic MRSA<br>
(EMRSA). Since the first EMRSA strain (EMRSA-1) was reported in 1981, 17<br>
distinct EMRSA strains have been identified, all of which are resistant to a number<br>
of antimicrobials. Recently, the two most prevalent strains have been EMRSA-15<br>
and -16, which account for 60-70% of the 30000 MRSA isolates reported<br>
(Livermore, D (2000) Int. J. Antimicrobial Agents, 16, S3 - S10). Importantly,<br>
strains of MRSA, (known as community-acquired MRSA (CA-MRSA)) have also<br>
started to spread in the community, ie. amongst non-hospitalised individuals.<br>
It is clear from the above that alternative methods of countering bacterial<br>
infection, particularly infection with MRSA are urgently required.<br>
One approach has been to employ a light-activated agent to achieve lethal<br>
photosensitization of the organism. This involves treating the organism with a lightactivatable<br>
chemical (photosensitiser) which, upon irradiation with light of a suitable<br>
wavelength, generates cytotoxic species, resulting in bacteriolysis. This technique has<br>
been used to achieve killing of a wide range of bacteria, including S. aureus and<br>
MRSA strains, in vitro using toluidine blue 0 (TBO) and aluminium disulphonated<br>
phthalocyanine (ALPcS2) as photosensitisers. Neither photosensitiser nor laser light<br>
alone exerted a bacteriocidal effect (Wilson et a/, (1994) J Antimicrob Chemother<br>
33, 619-24). In a subsequent study, 16 strains of EMRSA were found to be<br>
susceptible to killing by low doses of red light (674 nm) in the presence of AlPcS2<br>
(Griffiths et al, (1997) J Antimicrob Chemother, 40, 873-6). At higher light doses,<br>
100 % killing was achieved.<br>
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is the application of such an approach to the<br>
treatment of disease. It is an established procedure in the treatment of carcinoma and<br>
forms the basis of a means of sterilising blood products. It has only been more<br>
recently that the application of PDT to the treatment of infectious diseases has been<br>
evaluated. For example, haematoporphyrins in conjunction with an argon laser have<br>
been used to treat post-neurosurgical infections and brain abscesses (Lombard et al,<br>
(1985), Photodynamic Therapy of Tumours and other Diseases, Ed. Jori &amp; Perria).<br>
One potential problem associated with PDT of infectious diseases is its lack<br>
of specificity. Hence, if the photosensitiser binds to, or is taken up by, a host cell, as<br>
well as the target organism, then subsequent irradiation may also lead to the death of<br>
the host cell. A way to overcome this is by the use of targeting compounds: that is,<br>
any compound that is capable of specifically binding to the surface of the pathogen.<br>
Several targeting compounds have previously been shown to be successful in<br>
eliminating specific strains of bacteria when they were conjugated to a<br>
photosensitiser. For example, immunoglobulin G (IgG) has been used to target S.<br>
aureus Protein A (Gross et al (1997), Photochemistry and Photobiology, 66, 872-8),<br>
monoclonal antibody against Porphyromonas gingivalis lipopolysaccharide (Bhatti et<br>
al (2000), Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy, 44, 2615-8) and poIy-L-lysine<br>
peptides against P. gingivalis and Actinomyces viscosus (Soukos et al (1998),<br>
Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy, 42, 2595-2601). A monoclonal antibody<br>
conjugated via dextran chains to the photosensitiser tin (IV) chlorin e6 (SnCe6) was<br>
selective for killing P. aeruginosa when exposed to light at 630nm, leaving S. aureus<br>
unaffected (Friedberg et al (1991), Ann N Y Acad Sci, 618, 383-393).<br>
The present inventors have used IgG conjugated to SnCe6 to target EMRSA<br>
strains 1, 3, 15 arid 16 (Embleton et al (2002), J Antimicrob Chemother, 50, 857-<br>
864), achieving higher levels of killing than the photosensitiser alone, and selectively<br>
killing the EMRSA strains in a mixture with Streptococcus sanguis. However, a<br>
limitation of IgG is that only strains of S. aureus expressing Protein A can be<br>
targeted. Hence alternative targeting agents that can target any S. aureus strain are<br>
desirable.<br>
Bacteriophage are viruses that infect certain bacteria, often causing them to<br>
lyse and hence effecting cell death. They have been proposed as antibacterial agents<br>
in their own right. However, one of the problems with using staphylococcal<br>
bacteriophage (termed staphylophage) in the treatment of S. aureus disease is their<br>
restricted host range. Although there are polyvalent staphylophage which can lyse<br>
many S. aureus strains, other strains are resistant and hence bacteriophages alone<br>
could not provide an effective method of killing all strains of S. aureus.<br>
It is known that although some bacteriophage will only kill a limited range of<br>
bacteria, they will bind to a broader range of bacteria. The present inventors have<br>
now found that some bacteriophage can serve as an effective, targeted delivery<br>
system for photosensitisers.<br>
The present inventors have found that when a bacteriophage is linked to a<br>
photosensitiser, the photosensitiser-bacteriophage conjugate formed is highly<br>
effective in killing bacteria when irradiated with light of a suitable wavelength.<br>
Bacteriophage-photosensitiser conjugates could be used to treat or prevent a<br>
broad range of bacterial skin and wound infections. The most frequently isolated<br>
organisms from skin and wound infections are: coagulase-negative staphylococci, S.<br>
aureus, streptococci, e.g. Streptoccocus pyogenes, Corynebacterium spp., E coli,<br>
Klebsiella aerogenes, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes,<br>
Propionibacterium acnes, Bacteroides spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa and<br>
Peptostreptococcus spp..<br>
In particular, conjugates of photosensitiser and staphylophage can be used in<br>
a method of photodynamic therapy against strains ofStaphylococci spp, particularly<br>
against MRSA, EMRSA, VRSA, hetero-VRSA and CA-MRSA.<br>
The invention provides a composition comprising a photosensitizing<br>
compound (photosensitiser) linked to a bacteriophage to form a photosensitiserbacteriophage<br>
conjugate. The bacteriophage may be a staphylococcal phage, and is<br>
preferably a staphylophage that can bind to Staphylococcus aureus, particularly<br>
MRSA, EMRSA, VRSA, hetero-VRSA or CA-MRSA. The composition may be<br>
used in a method of photodynamic therapy.<br>
The bacteriophage is preferably linked to the photosensitiser using a covalent<br>
linkage. The photosensitiser and/or the bacteriophage contain or may be modified to<br>
contain groups which can be covalently crosslinked using chemical or photoreactive<br>
reagents, to produce crosslinked bonds, for example thiol-thiol crosslinking, amineamine<br>
crosslinking, amine-thiol crosslinking, amine-carboxylic acid crosslinking,<br>
thiol-carboxylic acid crosslinking, hydroxyl-carboxylic acid crosslinking, hydroxylthiol<br>
crosslinking and combinations thereof.<br>
The photosensitiser is suitably chosen from porphyrins (e.g.<br>
haematoporphyrin derivatives, deuteroporphyrin), phthalocyanines (e.g. zinc, silicon<br>
and aluminium phthalocyanines), chlorins (e.g. tin chlorin e6, poly-lysine derivatives<br>
of tin chlorin e6, m-tetrahydroxyphenyl chlorin, benzoporphyrin derivatives, tin<br>
etiopurpurin), bacteriochlorins, phenothiaziniums (e.g. toluidine blue, methylene<br>
blue, dimethylmethylene blue), phenazines (e.g. neutral red), acridines (e.g.<br>
acriflavine, proflavin, acridine orange, aminacrine), texaphyrins, cyanines (e.g.<br>
merocyanine 540), anthracyclins (e.g. adriamycin and epirubicin), pheophorbides,<br>
sapphyrins, fullerene, halogenated xanthenes (e.g. rose bengal), perylenequinonoid<br>
pigments (e.g. hypericin, hypocrellin), gilvocarcins, terthiophenes,<br>
benzophenanthridines, psoralens and riboflavin.<br>
The invention is directed to killing bacteria using the above-described<br>
conjugates. The bacteriophage used in the conjugate may be selected according to the<br>
particular organism to be killed, in order to arrive at the conjugate most effective<br>
against the particular infecting bacteria. In a preferred embodiment, the infecting<br>
bacterium is MRSA, EMRSA, VRSA, hetero-VRSA or CA-MRSA and the<br>
conjugate includes the staphylococcal phage 75 or phageΦl 1.<br>
Table 1 below shows some examples of bacteria-bacteriophage pairs,<br>
although many more examples exist. Further novel bacteriophages can be isolated<br>
and/or adapted to the target bacteria. The specificity of the treatment can be modified<br>
as required by using monovalent bacteriophages, polyvalent bacteriophages or<br>
combinations of monovalent bacteriophages or combinations of monovalent and<br>
polyvalent bacteriophages.<br>

carbonate and magnesium chloride. The ions are suitably present in an amount of<br>
from 5 to 200mM, preferably from 5 to 15 mM, more preferably about 1 OmM.<br>
The composition may further comprise one or more ingredients chosen from<br>
buffers, salts for adjusting the tonicity, antioxidants, preservatives, gelling agents and<br>
remineralisation agents.<br>
The invention further provides a method of killing bacteria, comprising<br>
(a) contacting an area to be treated with the composition of the invention such<br>
that any bacteria in the area bind to the photosensitiser-bacteriophage<br>
conjugate; and<br>

appropriate wavelength may be used. The wavelength of the light is selected to<br>
correspond to the absorption maximum of the photosensitiser and to have sufficient<br>
energy to activate the photosensitiser. The source of light may be any device or<br>
biological system able to generate monochromatic or polychromatic light. Examples<br>
include laser, light emitting diode, arc lamp, halogen lamp, incandescent lamp or an<br>
emitter of bioluminescence or chemiluminescence. In certain circumstances, sunlight<br>
may be suitable. Preferably, the wavelength of the light emitted by the light source<br>

poured into plates, covered and allowed to cool overnight.<br>
Target organisms<br>
The organisms used in the examples were as follows, given as names and<br>
NCTC (National Collection of Type Cultures, UK) or ATCC (American Type<br>
Culture Collection, USA) numbers:<br>
Epidemic methicillin-resistant S. aureus (EMRSA)-l (NCTC 11939)<br>
EMRSA-3(NCTC13130)<br>
EMRSA-15(NCTC13142)<br>
EMRSA-16(NCTC13143)<br>
Mu3 (ATCC 700698), is a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)<br>
strain with heterogeneous resistance to vancomycin, designated heterogeneously<br>
vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (hetero-VRSA) (Hanaki et al (1998). J.<br>
Antimicrob. Chemother. 42:199-209)<br>

Bacteriopbage<br>
Phage 75 (Public Health Laboratory Service, UK) is a serogroup F<br>
staphylococcal phage, capable of infecting EMRSA-16, EMRSA-3 and weakly<br>
infectingEMRSA-15.<br>
Bacteriophage 411 (landolo et al, (2002), Gene 289 (1-2); 109-118) is a<br>
temperate bacteriophage of serological group B.Φl 1 is a transducing phage with a<br>
low lysogenisation frequency. It infects S.aureus lytic group III strains which include<br>
many human and animal pathogens.<br>
Bacteriophage propagation<br>
Mid-exponential EMRSA-16 (300ul) was added to 15ml Falcon tubes.<br>
Approximately 10s pfu of phage 75 were added to the tubes and allowed to incubate<br>
at room temperature for 30 min to allow the phage to infect the bacteria. 9ml of<br>
cooled molten top NB2 agar (with lOmM CaC^), was added to the tubes, and the<br>
mixture poured onto undried NB2 base agar plates. The plates were left to incubate<br>
at 37 °C overnight.<br>
The next morning 1 ml of NB2 with 10 mM CaCl2 was added to each plate,<br>
and the top agar with the liquid medium was scraped into a small centrifuge tube.<br>
The collected agar was then spun in a centrifuge at 15000 rpm for 15 min at 4°C.<br>
The supernatant was collected and passed through a 0.45 μm (Nalgene) filter to<br>
remove any bacterial cells. The resulting solution of phage 75 was stored at 4°C.<br>
Bacteriophage precipitation<br>
Phage precipitation was carried out to purify the phage 75 from the NB2<br>
medium after propagation. To 5ml of phage 75 in NB2, 1.3 ml of 5M NaCl (1M<br>
final concentration) and 0.2 ml Ix phosphate buffered saline (PBS) (8.0g/l NaCl,<br>
0.2g/l KC1, 1.15 g/1 Na2HPO4t 0.2g/l KH2PO4) were added, and 20% PEG<br>
 (polyethylene glycol 8000, Sigma) was added to the solution and stirred slowly<br>
overnight until completely dissolved. The solution was then placed on ice overnight<br>
and the next morning the solution was centrifuged at 8OOOrpm for 20 min at 4°C.<br>
The supernatant was removed and the remaining pellet was resuspended in 2.5ml 1x<br>
PBS, and filtered through a 0.45 urn filter.<br>
Photosensitiser<br>
The photosensitiser used was tin (IV) chlorin e6 (SnCe6) (Frontier Scientific,<br>
Lancashire, UK), which is photoactivatable at 633 nm.<br>
Preparation of conjugate<br>
2mg of SnCe6 was dissolved with stirring in 800μl of activation buffer (0.1<br>
M MES (2-(N-morpholino(ethanesulphonic acid) (Sigma)), 0.5 M NaCl, pH 5.5). An<br>
EDC (l-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiirnidehydrochloride) (Sigma)<br>
solution (4mg in 1 ml activation buffer) and a S-NHS (Nhydroxysulphosuccinimide)<br>
(Fluka) solution (2.7 mg in 250 ul activation buffer)<br>
were made.<br>
To the dissolved SnCe6, 200ul of dissolved EDC and S-NHS were added,<br>
and the mixture was left for 1 to 4 hours at room temperature with stirring to provide<br>
a stable amine-reactive intermediate. The mixture was covered in aluminium foil as<br>
SnCe6 is a light sensitive reagent. The reaction was quenched by adding 1.4μl (3-<br>
mercaptoethanol (Sigma).<br>
Experiments were carried out using the reagents at a molar ratio of<br>
SnCe6:EDC:S-NHS of 1:1:2.5.<br>
The pH of the reactive SnCe6 mixture was neutralised to 7.0 by adding 0.7ml<br>
1 M NaOH. 1.5ml of phage 75 was then added to the amine-reactive solution to<br>
allow the amino groups on the phage to react with the carboxyl groups of the SnCe6,<br>
and then mixed for 4 to 16 hours. The reaction was quenched with 2.5ul<br>
ethanolamine (Sigma).<br>
The photosensitiser-phage conjugate (PS-phage) was separated from free PS<br>
after conjugation by precipitating the PS-phage twice, as described above in<br>
Bacteriophage Precipitation. The PS-phage was then dialysed against PBS.<br>
In the examples below, the concentration of phage 75 is 7.3x106 pfu/ml and<br>
the concentration of SnCe6/bacteriophage-SnCe6 is 1.5 μg/ml.<br>
Laser<br>
The laser used was a Model 127 Stabilite helium-neon (He/Ne) laser (Spectra<br>
Physics, USA) with a power output of 35 mW. The laser emitted radiation in a<br>
collimated beam, diameter 1.25 mm, with a wavelength of 633nm.<br>
Example 1<br>
A culture of EMRSA-16 in the mid-exponential growth phase was diluted to<br>
Ixl07cfu/ml. 20μl samples of the diluted bacteria were then placed into wells of a<br>
96-well plate (Nunc), together with a magnetic stirrer bar.<br>
100 ul of the phage 75-SnCe6 conjugate prepared above and calcium chloride<br>
(CaCl2) to a final concentration of 10 mM was added to the bacteria. The contents of<br>
the wells were left to incubate at room temperature for 5 min, with stirring. Controls<br>
were performed with 100 ul IxPBS added to the bacteria and used as a reference for<br>
experimental samples. The experiment was carried out in duplicate.<br>
After incubation, the contents of the well were directly exposed to the laser<br>
light for 5 min, with stirring, corresponding to an energy density of 21 J/cm2.<br>
Aluminium foil was placed in the surrounding wells to allow any escaping laser light<br>
to be reflected back into the target well. Controls were performed with no laser<br>
irradiation.<br>
After exposure to the laser, 100 ul samples were immediately taken from each<br>
well and serially diluted, from" 10' to 10"4, in 1 ml TSY in 1.5 ml Eppendorf tubes.<br>
Aliquots of 50 ul of each dilution were then placed and spread out on half a CB A<br>
plate. The plates were placed in a 37°C incubator overnight. The following morning<br>
the number of survivors was counted, the average between the four sets was taken<br>
and multiplied by the appropriate dilution factor, and graphically analysed.<br>
Phageat7.3xl06pfu/ml<br>
SnCe6/phage at 1.5 ug/ml<br>
It was found that over 99.9% of the EMRSA-16 were killed.<br>
Example 2<br>
Example 1 was repeated, using EMRSA-1 in place of EMRSA-16. It was<br>
found that 99.98% of the bacteria were killed.<br>
Example 3<br>
Example 1 was repeated, using EMRSA-3 in place of EMRSA-16. It was<br>
found that over 99.99% of the bacteria were killed.<br>
Example 4<br>
Example 1 was repeated, using EMRSA-15 in place of EMRSA-16. It was<br>
found that over 99.99% of the bacteria were killed.<br>
Example 5<br>
Example 1 was repeated, using S. epidermidis in place of EMRSA-16. It was<br>
found that over 99.99% of the bacteria were killed.<br>
Result for Examples 1 to 5 are presented in Figure 1.<br>
Example 6<br>
Example 1 was repeated, using lOul each EMRSA-16 and S. epidermidis in<br>
place of the 20^1 samples of EMRSA-16. Samples were plated on MBA plates for<br>
enumeration.<br>
Phage at 7.3xl06pfu/ml<br>
SnCe6/phage at 1.5 μg/ml<br>
21 J/cm2 laser light<br>
It was found that over 99.99% of both bacterial strains were killed in the<br>
mixed culture.<br>
Comparative Example<br>
Example 6 was repeated, firstly in the absence of conjugate, and without<br>
exposing to laser light, secondly with SnCe6 photosensitiser and exposure to laser<br>
light, and thirdly with phage 75 and without exposure to laser light.<br>
The results for Example 6 and for the Comparative Example are presented in<br>
Figure 2.<br>
The Examples show that the conjugate is highly effective at killing all of the<br>
EMRSA strains tested. Since phage 75 is only capable of infecting EMRSA-15 and<br>
EMRSA-16, this indicates that the phage is able to successfully bind to strains it is<br>
incapable of infecting, thus acting as an effective targetting agent. The attached<br>
photosensitisers then effected the killing upon laser irradiation.<br>
Significant kills were also obtained with S. epidermidis, both alone and in a<br>
mixture with MRSA, indicating that the phage also bound to non-related<br>
staphylococcal strains. The phage 75-SnCe6 conjugate is useful for a variety of<br>
staphylococcal infections.<br>
Example 7<br>
Targeted Photodynamic Therapy using Φll-SnCe6 Conjugates against<br>
Staphvlococcus aureus and a laser light source<br>
Bacteriophage 011 was propagated and precipitated as described above for<br>
phage 75, except.that S aureus strain 8325-4 was used as the propagating strain. Tin<br>
chlorin e6 (SnCe6) was conjugated onto Staphylococcus phage Φ1l using the method<br>
described above, achieving bound concentrations of 2.3 and 3.5 ug ml"1 SnCe6 with<br>
the phage 011 at 4.7 x 107 pfu.ml"1. These Φ11-SnCe6 conjugates were then<br>
incubated with various strains of Staphylococcus aureus and exposed to laser light at<br>
633nm from a 35mW HeNe laser (21 J/cm2) for 5 minutes. The final concentration<br>
of conjugated SnCe6 was 1.15 μg ml"1.<br>
The results show that Φll-SnCe6 conjugates achieved a 92.33% kill of S.<br>
aureus 8325-4 (compared to control counts in phosphate buffered saline) after 5<br>
minutes exposure, whilst SnCe6 at a corresponding concentration (1.15μg ml"1) did<br>
not achieve any kill. The results are presented in Figure 3.<br>
We have also shown that this Φ11-SnCe6 conjugate is effective against a<br>
methicillin-resistant strain of the organism (EMRSA-16), achieving 88.11% kill,<br>
even though Φ11 only infects this strain under stringent optimal conditions. A range<br>
of control experiments such as; light without photosensitiser (L+S-), photosensitiser<br>
without light (L-S+), and unconjugated phage at 1 x 107 pfu ml"1 (L-S-); did not result<br>
in significant kills. The results are presented in Figure 4.<br>
By increasing the light dose to 10 minutes in the presence of calcium (lOmM)<br>
we are now achieving 99.88% kills against S. aureus 8325-4 using Φ1 1-SnCe6<br>
conjugates (1.75μg ml"1). The results are presented in Figure 5.<br>
For Figures 3 to 5 the photosensitiser (either SnCe6 or Φ11-SnCe6) was<br>
added to give a final concentration of 1.15 ug ml"1 (with respect to SnCe6). The light<br>
source was a 35 mW Helium/Neon laser and irradiation (when used) was for 5<br>
minutes in the case of Figures 3 and 4, and for 10 minutes in the case of Figure 5.<br>
The effect of varying the light dose on the kills obtained with the SnCe6-<br>
phage Φ1l conjugate was investigated. The experiments were carried out as<br>
described above except that the bacterial suspensions were exposed to light from the<br>
Helium/Neon laser for different periods of time - these were 1, 5, 10, 20 and 30<br>
minutes. In each case, the concentration of the Φ11-SnCe6 conjugate (final<br>
concentration equivalent to 3.5 ug ml"1 of SnCe6) was the same.<br>
Incubation of the organism with the Φ11-SnCe6 conjugate for upto 60<br>
minutes in the dark had no significant effect on the viable count. However,<br>
significant reductions in the viable count were obtained when the suspensions were<br>
exposed to laser light in the presence of theΦ11-SnCe6 conjugate - greater kills were<br>
obtained with the longer exposure times. Using an exposure time of 30 minutes, a<br>
reduction in the viable count of approximately 99.9999% was obtained.<br>
Φ11-SnCe6 was used to give a final concentration of 3.5 μg ml"1 (with respect to<br>
SnCe6). The light source was a 35 mW Helium/Neon laser and irradiation (when<br>
used) was for 1, 5,10,20 or 30 minutes. The results are presented in Figure 6.<br>

Approx light intensity = 44,000 lux or 470^W/nm<br>
Phage 75 was conjugated to SnCe6 as described above. Phages were used at a<br>
concentration of 1 x 107 pfu/ml.<br>
Ovemight cultures of S. aureus grown in nutrient broth were centrifuged,<br>
resuspended in PBS and adjusted to an OD of 0.05 at 600nm (approximately 4 x 107<br>
cfu/ml)<br>
50ul of bacterial culture was aliquoted into a 96-well plate and 50μl of the one of the<br>
following solutions added to the wells:<br>

Wells were either exposed to white light (4 wells at a time) or wrapped in tin<br>
foil and stored in the dark.<br>
After various exposure times an aliquot was taken from each well, serially<br>
diluted and spread onto Columbia blood agar. Agar plates were incubated overnight<br>
at 37°C and counted the next day.<br>

All results are the average of replicate experiments.<br>
Controls included bacteria incubated with SnCe6, phage 75-SnCe6 and phage 75<br>
without exposure to white light. Phage 75 was also exposed to white light.<br>
All controls had bacterial counts which were not significantly different to the control<br>
suspension which had no photosensitiser added and was not irradiated.<br>

Further tests were carried out on S. aureus strains Mu3, Mu50 and MW2. To<br>
suspensions of vancomycin-resistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus (Mu3 and<br>
Mu50) or a community-acquired strain of MRSA (MW2), saline, phage 75, SnCe6 or<br>
phage 75-SnCe6 was added and samples exposed to light from a 35 mW<br>
Helium/Neon laser.<br>
The concentration of SnCe6 used was 1.5 ug/ml, the phage concentration was<br>
5.1 x 107 plaque-forming units/ml and the light energy dose was 21 J/cm2. The<br>
numbers above the bars represent the % kill of the organism relative to the sample to<br>
which saline only was added. The results are presented in Figure 7.<br>
Example 10<br>
Lethal photosensitization of Streptococcus pvogenes using tin cblorin e6 (SnCe6).<br>
Streptococcus pyogenes ATCC 12202 was grown in Brain Heart Infusion<br>
broth at 37°C in an atmosphere consisting of 5%C02 in air. The cells were harvested<br>
by centrifugation and re-suspended in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and diluted to<br>
Ix 107cfu/ml in PBS. 20μl samples of the diluted bacterial suspension were then<br>
placed into wells of a 96-well plate, together with a magnetic stirrer bar. 100μl of<br>
different concentrations (1-50μg/ml) of the SnCe6 in PBS was added to the<br>
bacterial suspensions. Controls were performed with 100 μ1 PBS added to the<br>
bacteria and either irradiated (L+S-) or kept in the dark (L-S-). The experiment was<br>
carried out in duplicate.<br>
After incubation, the contents of some of the wells were exposed to light from<br>
the 35 mW Helium/Neon laser emitting light with a wavelength of 633nm for 10<br>
min, with stirring, corresponding to an energy density of 42 J/cm2. Aluminium foil<br>
was placed in the surrounding wells to allow any escaping laser light to be reflected<br>
back into the target well. Control wells were not irradiated with laser light.<br>
After exposure to the laser light, 100 nl samples were immediately taken from<br>
each well and serially diluted, from 10'1 to 10"5, in 1 ml TSY in 1.5 ml Eppendorf<br>
tubes. Duplicate 50 μl aliquots of each dilution were then spread out on half a CBA<br>
plate. The plates were placed in a 37°C incubator for up to 48 h and the resulting<br>
colonies were counted to determine the number of surviving organisms.<br>
Incubation of the organism in the dark with increasing concentrations of<br>
SnCe6 had no significant effect on the viable count. Neither did irradiation of the<br>
organism with laser light in the absence of the photosensitiser. However, irradiation<br>
of the organism in the presence of SnCe6 resulted in a concentration-dependent<br>
decrease in the viable count. A 99.9997% kill of the organism was obtained using a<br>
photosensitiser concentration of 50 μ/ml. The results are presented in Figure 8. In<br>
