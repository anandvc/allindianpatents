3.	PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is  to be performed : -<br><br>
INTRABOLT<br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a door lock and particularly a door lock of combination bolt type that is a horizontal latch bolt and a vertical deadbolt combination wherein vertical deadbolt can be locked and unlocked by turning only one knob or a key and latch bolt can be unlocked by pulling a puller or a key and locked automatically by the spring force when the door is shut.<br>
PRIOR ART<br>
Heretofore, it was known to mount several locks having horizontal latch bolt and vertical deadbolt at various places along the side of the door. Each bolt was generally separately actuated by either knob or key. Such bolt combinations require a person to perform several locking or unlocking functions. Also the presence of numerous locks in an effort to provide security presented and aesthetically undesirable appearance. In normal rim locks, the dead bolt and latch bolt are simultaneously actuated by a key or knob. The bolts are both horizontally disposed and reciprocable with the door jamb. Such bolts can be readily circumvented by a crow bar separating a jamb plate from the bolts.<br>
Now there is provided by the present invention a high security combination deadbolt and latch bolt wherein dead bolt is vertically disposed adjacent to the jamb on the inside of the door and the latch bolt is horizontally transversely disposed in adjacent the door jamb. Both the bolts are commonly operated by either key on outside and / or a knob / puller handle on inside of the door as well as alternatively another key on the inside of the door. It is therefore, an object of invention to provide a high security lock wherein two bolts are transversely disposed in the locked / unlocked position. It is another object of this invention to provide a lock as aforesaid in which one bolt is vertically disposed on the inside of the door adjacent<br><br><br>
the jamb and the other bolt is horizontally disposed within the jamb. It is still a further object of this invention to provide a lock as aforesaid which may be actuated by a rotating action of a key on outside of the door. It is still a further object of this invention to provide a lock as aforesaid which may be actuated by a knob and puller handle on the inside of the door and which readily provides the user with an indication of whether the door is locked or unlocked when viewed from a distance.<br>
Another object of the invention is to provide a lock as aforesaid which is safe and<br>
practical in use and yet is readily fabricated and of readily inexpensive construction,<br>
while being aesthetically acceptable when door mounted.      Further objects and<br>
advantages of the present invention will become apparent from the following<br>

Further embodiments of the present invention will become apparent from the following description and the accompanying drawings which illustrates certain possible variations and wherein Fig. 17, there is a lock shown similar to the invention wherein a key cylinder means are employed on both the sides.<br>
In the another embodiment as shown in fig. 18, the lock is provided with a single locking deadbolt and horizontal latchbolt arrangement . In further embodiment as shown in fig. 19, the lock is provided with a single locking deadbolt and horizontal latchbolt arrangement wherein a key cylinder means are employed on both the sides.<br><br><br>
In still further embodiment as shown in fig. 20, a double locking vertical deadbolt arrangement.<br>
In further embodiment as shown in fig. 21, the lock is provided with a double locking deadbolt arrangement wherein a key cylinder means are employed on both the sides.<br>
In further embodiment as shown in fig. 22, the lock is provided with a single locking deadbolt arrangement only In further embodiment as shown in fig. 23, the lock is provided with a single locking deadbolt arrangement only and wherein a key cylinder means are employed on both the sides<br>
In the aforesaid embodiment, the receptacle is shown as serving both the bolts but separate accurately mounted receptacle plates may be employed for each bolt if desired.<br>
It is also within the contemplation of this invention to provide a lock as afore described in which there is a single actuating means such as a knob or key mounted to the inside of the door and wherein the front or outside of the door is blank, so that only a person on inside could actuate the double lock. The person on the outside could only be let in by a person on the inside.<br>
It is also within the contemplation of this invention to utilize other type of bolts such as by way of example, latch bolts, automatic deadbolts.<br>
In the aforesaid manner of construction and attempted jimming of lock is frustrated insofar as any application of a side to side force is blocked by presence of vertical deadbolt and any application of a front to back force is blocked by the presence of the horizontal bolt i.e. a burglar would attempt to jimmy the horizontal bolt by applying a side to side force to move the receptacle from the bolt.   However, with<br><br><br>
the present construction the vertically disposed bolt locks this action. And a burglar would attempt to jimmy a vertical receptacle by applying front to back force in an attempt to strip the vertical receptacle from the back of jamb. However, with the present construction, the horizontally disposed bolts blocks this action. Thus, the present two co-ordinated and transversely aligned deadbolts and latchbolts are seen to compliment each other in providing jimmy-proof lock.<br>
From the foregoing, it will be seen that this invention is one well adapted to attain all of the ends and objects hereinabove set forth, together with other advantages which are obvious and which are inherent in the lock.<br>
It will be understood that certain features and sub-combinations are of utility and may be employed without reference to other features and sub combinations. This is contemplated by and is within the scope of the claims.<br>
As many possible embodiments may be made of the invention without departing from the scope thereof, it is to be understood that all matter herein set forth or shown in the accompanying drawings is to be interpreted as illustrative and not in a limiting sense.<br><br><br>

Attempts to jimmy, push back the horizontal bolt in its line of least resistance are frustrated by the presence of the vertically locked twin bolt acting against the jimmy and force. The bolts are both operated by single key actuated cylinder and / or hand knob through a common crank mechanism with co-ordinated cam actions. In other embodiments, keys may be employed on both the inside and outside of the door. In further embodiments the vertical deadbolt can be made with single locking or twin locking and operated almost in a similar manner.<br>
