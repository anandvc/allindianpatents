				<td>A low-inductance electromagnetic drive without driving magnetic flux circuit for<br>
audio and/or video apparatus<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to an electromagnetic drive for audio and/or video apparatus. More specifically, this invention relates to a low-inductance electromagnetic drive without driving magnetic flux circuit for improving the recording and playing quality of audio signal. The electromagnetic drive of this invention can be used in loudspeaker, earphone and acoustic transducer.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE PRIOR ART<br>
The audio and/or video apparatus is popular in people's lives. There are energy converters for converting sound energy to electric energy mutually in an audio and/or video, such as loudspeaker, earphone and sonic transducer (microphone). The energy conversion between electricity and sound is performed by applying the magnetic field on current-carrying conductor in a converter which comprises the driving system, vibrating system and supporting system. The electromagnetic energy converters with drive coils and inductance are employed in the driving system. The inductive impedance changes with the variation of frequency, i.e., when the frequency rises, the inductive impedance increases so that the obtained energy of electromagnetic energy converter changes, which will lead to the change of driving force. At the same time, because of the existence of inductance, the phase shifts will occur due to the voltage and the current through the loudspeaker, which will lead to defective feedback to the power amplifier used for driving loudspeaker. Moreover, due to the effects of conversion between electric energy and magnetic energy and the magnetic hysteresis, the energy supplied to the drive coil of loudspeaker will excite the magnetic circuit of loudspeaker to generate magnetic energy that is stored in the magnetic circuit system of loudspeaker. When the phase of voltage changes in combination with the effect of magnetic energy converting to electric energy, the energy stored in the magnetic circuit of loudspeaker will act on the drive coil via the differential resistance of power amplifier, which will lead to frequency response and distortion of loudspeaker, earphone and sonic transducer.<br>
As far as the inventor of this invention knows, a short-circuit ring 8 was installed in the sensitive position of drive coil 2 to reduce the harmful excitation of drive coil to the magnetic circuit system and the inductance quantity of electromagnetic drive in some products in the prior art (as shown in Fig. 11), and the short-circuit ring which is generally a conductor such as copper is made into a closed ring and mounted around the periphery of magnetic pole 1. But because only part of the energy produced by drive coil can just be passively consumed by the short-circuit ring, and the short-circuit ring is not connected electrically with the drive coil, the short-circuit ring may not apply positive and equivalent feed back excitation to the magnetic circuit system to counteract the harmful excitation of drive coil on magnetic circuit system. The effectiveness is limited, so they are different from this invention.<br><br>
SUMMAR OF THE INVENTION<br>
In view of the disadvantages of the above prior art, the object of the present invention is to provide a low-inductance electromagnetic drive without driving magnetic flux circuit, in which the inductive impedance changes small when the frequency changes, so that the electric energy obtained by electromagnetic energy converter changes small with the variation of inductive impedance, the phase unstable is decreased, and the sound distortion led by the magnetic flux circuit excitateded is basically eliminated.<br>
To achieve the above object of the present invention, a low-inductance electromagnetic drive without driving magnetic flux circuit is provided comprising a magnetic pole 1, a drive coil 2, an upper magnetic inductive board 4, a permanent magnet 5 and a lower magnetic-inductive board 6. The magnetic pole 1 is integrated with the lower magnetic-inductive board 6, and the permanent magnet 5 is located between the upper magnetic-inductive board 4 and lower magnetic-inductive board 6. The drive coil 2 is covered around the magnetic pole 1 and is movable in the axial direction. The electromagnetic drive further comprises the first fastening coil 3 with an inductance quantity approximating to the equivalent inductance of the drive coil, and the first fastening coil 3 is fixed at a proper position in the magnetic flux circuit and connected with the drive coil 2 in opposite phase to receive the equivalent and opposite excitation.<br>
The first fastening coil 3 is located between the drive coil 2 and magnetic pole 1, and is fixed to the magnetic pole 1. The first fastening coil 3 is connected with the drive coil 2 by opposite phase in the form of the smallest inductance quantity to receive the equivalent excitation of opposite phase.<br>
The first fastening coil 3 is fixed to the upper magnetic-inductive board 4, and the first fastening coil 3 is connected with the drive coil 2 by opposite phase in the form of the smallest inductance quantity to receive the equivalent excitation of opposite phase.<br>
The first fastening coil 3 is connected with the drive coil 2 by opposite phase in series connection or parallel connection to receive the equivalent excitation of opposite phase.<br>
Though there has been obvious improvement when the ratio of the equivalent inductance between the first fastening coil 3 to the drive coil 2 is in the range from 0.5 to 1.5, it is prefer that the equivalent inductance of the first fastening coil 3 is in close proximity to the drive coil 2.<br>
A low-inductance electromagnetic drive without driving magnetic flux circuit comprises a magnetic pole 1, a drive coil 2, an upper magnetic-inductive board 4, a permanent magnet 5 and a lower magnetic-inductive board 6. The magnetic pole 1 is connected with the lower magnetic-inductive board 6 integrative, and the permanent magnet 5 locates between the upper magnetic-inductive board 4 and lower magnetic-inductive board 6. The drive coil 2 is covered around the magnetic pole 1 and is removable in the axial direction. The electromagnetic drive further comprises the first fastening coil 3 and second fastening coil 7. The total inductance quantity of the two fastening coils is approximate to the equivalent inductance of the drive coil 2. The<br><br>
first fastening coil 3 and the second fastening coil 7 are fixed at a proper position in the magnetic flux circuit, and both connected with the drive coil 2 in opposite phase to receive the equivalent excitation of opposite phase.<br>
The first fastening coil 3 and the second fastening coil 7 are both fixed on the magnetic pole 1 and are both connected with the drive coil 2 by opposite phase in the form of the smallest inductance quantity to receive the equivalent excitation of opposite phase.<br>
The first fastening coil 3 and the second fastening coil 7 are fixed to the magnetic pole land upper magnetic-inductive board 4 respectively, and they are both connected with the drive coil 2 by opposite phase in the form of the smallest inductance quantity to receive the equivalent excitation of opposite phase.<br>
The first fastening coil 3 and the second fastening coil 7 are connected with the drive coil 2 by opposite phase in series connection or parallel connection to receive the equivalent excitation of opposite phase.<br>
The distortion has been amended obviously when the ratio of the total equivalent inductance of the first fastening coil 3 and the second fastening coil 7 to the drive coil 2 is in the range from 0.5 to 1.5. Preferably, the total equivalent inductance quantity of the first fastening coil 3 and the second fastening coil 7 is close proximity to the drive coil 2.<br>
The first fastening coil 3 can also be made of magnetic metal used for magnetic conductor.<br>
When choosing the electrical parameters of fastening coil, the principle of "the opposite phase exciting energy produced by fastening coil is in close proximity the exciting energy produced by drive coil as far as possible so that it may be eliminated by the exciting energy produced by drive coil" should be follow. In practice, there are lots of choices, but of which the main examples are listed as bellows:<br>
a When the fastening coils connected with the drive coils in series, the loudspeaker will work well, if the inductance quantity of fastening coil is in close proximity to equivalent inductance quantity of drive coil, and the coupling factor with the drive coil is near to 1, as well as the direct current resistance is small. b.When the fastening coils connected with the drive coils in parallel, preferably, the inductance quantity of fastening coil is in close proximity to equivalent inductance quantity of drive coil, the coupling factor with the drive coil is near to 1, and the total quantity of direct current resistance in the current circuit of fastening coil is designed in such a way that the exciting energy produced by drive coil is nearly eliminated by the opposite phase exciting energy produced by fastening coil as far as possible. c.When the fastening coils connected with the drive coils in series and parallel connections, preferably, the total inductance quantity of fastening coil is in close proximity to the equivalent inductance quantity of drive coil, the coupling factor of fastening coil fastening coil with the drive coil is near to 1, and the total quantity of direct current resistance in the current circuit of fastening coil is designed in such a way that the exciting energy produced by drive coil is nearly eliminated by the opposite phase exciting energy produced by fastening coil as far<br><br>
as possible.<br>
No matter what kinds of connection is taken, as long as the extent of 0.5 to 1.5 times of exciting energy produced by the drive coil is counteracted by the opposite phase exciting energy produced by the fastening coil, the distortion of loudspeaker is reformed obviously.<br>
Since the drive source applies a positive excitation which is equivalent but in opposite phase as that of drive coil to the fastening coil, the excitation energy produced by the magnetic circuit system as the current flowed through loudspeaker is minimized, the inductance quantity of the loudspeaker is decreased to smallest, and the sound distortion of vibrating system connected with drive coil is diminished.<br>
The technical advantages of the present invention are illustrated below.<br>
Because a fastening coil whose inductance quantity is close to the equivalent inductance quantity of drive coil is set in the sensitive position of drive coil in this invention, and fixed and drive coils are connected in opposite phase, the excitation produced by drive source on fastening coil is equivalent but reversal to the drive coil ; because the fixed and drive coils produced equivalent but reversal excitation, the two-way excitation will eliminate each other, which will make the excitation energy obtained by the magnetic circuit system of loudspeaker falls down to the lowest level; as a result, the magnetic intensity of magnetic circuit system will not change with the variation of feed-in signal of loudspeaker, and the sound distortion of vibrating system connected with drive coil will diminish.<br>
Since a fastening coil that can produce an equivalent but reversal excitation to drive coil is taken in this invention, the inductance quantity of loudspeaker is reduced. So the loudspeaker gets the drive energy in a wide range of frequency homogeneously, the frequency range of playback is extended.<br>
Since the impedance characteristic of the loudspeaker manufactured by this invention is very close to pure resistance, it is simple to treat the interface of loudspeaker and power amplifier.<br>
The quality of audio recording and playing may be effectively by those features at a very low expense.<br>

The magnetic pole 1 is integrated with the lower magnetic board 6, and the permanent magnet 5 is set between the upper magnetic-inductive board 4 and the lower magnetic-inductive board 6 and connected with both of them. The drive coils 2, the first fastening coil 3 and the second fastening coil 7 are arranged on the magnetic pole. The two fastening coils are connected with the drive coil in such a way that the quantity of inductance is minimum, and the first fastening coil 3 and the second fastening coil 7 are wrapped and fasten around the magnetic pole 1.<br><br>
Fig. 4 shows the fourth embodiment of this invention, an electromagnetic drive comprises a magnetic pole 1, a drive coil 2, a first fastening coil 3, a second fastening coil 7, an upper magnetic-inductive board 4, a permanent magnet 5 and a lower magnetic-inductive board 6.

In the fifth embodiment of this invention as shown in Fig. 5, an electromagnetic drive comprises a magnetic pole 1, a drive coil 2, a first fastening coil 3 made of magnetic metal, an upper magnetic inductive board 4, a permanent magnet 5 and a lower magnetic-inductive board 6. The first fastening coil 3 is connected with the drive coil 2 to minimize the quantity of inductance. The first fastening coil 3 is made of magnetic metal; such as iron, mild steel or nickel-iron alloy et al. One way to produce the fastening coil is that the end part of the magnetic pole 1 made of magnetic metal is processed by external thread cutting to form the coil, and the out surface of the obtained cutting coil is treated to insulate, then the obtained cutting coil is engaged and fixed with the un-cutting helix part of the magnetic pole 1 to form the first fastening coil 3 with the function of magnetic pole, finally, the two ends of the first fastening coil 3 is leaded out to connect with the drive coil 2 in such a way that the quantity of inductance is minimum according to Fig. 5, or an equivalent but opposite phase excitation is applied on the fastening coil 3 by the drive source.<br>
When the electromagnetic drive of the present invention is used, the electromagnetic drive in the first or the second embodiment is set on the loudspeaker. The first fastening coil 3 is connected with the drive coil 2 in the opposite phase so that the inductive reactance decreases, the phase of current electric changes lightly, and the vibrating system is driven by drive coil 2 to diminish the distortion of sound.

According to the formula: Leq=L1+L2-2M and Leq=L1L2-M2 / L1+L2+2M, when the coupling coefficient is 1, the inductive reactance of the two coils with the same inductance quantity and connected in opposite phase is zero, and the impedance is the same as the direct current resistance of the two inductions. Since one or more tight coupled fastening coils is sit round the drive coil with huge inductance<br><br>
quantity, in which the total quantity of inductance of the fastening coils is in close proximity to the equivalent inductance of the drive coil, moreover, an equivalent but reversal excitation is applied on the fastening coils by connecting the fastening coils with drive coil in opposite phase through lead, as long as the inductance quantity and resistance value are well chosen, the loudspeaker will present characteristics very close to working under the pure resistance.<br>
For example, the loudspeaker with the electromagnetic drive of the first embodiment, when the loudspeaker is working, the electric energy is fed into the drive coil of loudspeaker by the drive source (such as an acoustic amplifier), meanwhile a reversal electric energy is fed into the first fastening coil 3, so the defective excitation produced by the drive coil 2 on the magnetic circuit system of the loudspeaker will be eliminated by the opposite phase excitation produced by the first fastening coil 3 on the magnetic circuit system of loudspeaker. By this means, the main object of "without driving the magnetic circuit" of the present invention is achieved, and the problem of the frequency response and distortion occurred in the loudspeaker, earphone and sonic transducer is solved.<br><br>
