				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
"ADSORBENT FOR ORAL ADMINISTRATION IN RENAL AND LIVER DISEASES"<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to an adsorbent for oral<br>
administration comprising a spherical activated carbon<br>
having a specific pore structure, and an adsorbent for oral<br>
administration comprising a surface-modified spherical<br>
activated carbon prepared by oxidizing and reducing the<br>
spherical activated carbon and having a similar specific<br>
pore structure.<br>
The adsorbent for oral administration, according to the<br>
present invention, exhibits a selective adsorbability, that<br>
is, a high adsorbability of harmful toxins, despite a low<br>
adsorbability of useful components such as digestive enzymes<br>
in a body. Further, the adsorbent has a specific pore<br>
structure, and thus, has a greatly improved selective<br>
adsorbability in comparison with that of a conventional<br>
adsorbent for oral administration. Therefore, the adsorbent<br>
for oral administration, according to the present invention,<br>
is effective for the treatment of a patient suffering from a<br>
liver or renal disease.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
In patients suffering with a lack of a renal function<br>
or a liver function, harmful toxic substances are<br>
accumulated or formed in bodies, such as blood, with a<br>
progress of a disorder of the organ functions, and thus an<br>
encephalopathia occurs, such as a disturbance of<br>
consciousness or uremia. Yearly, there is a growing number<br>
of such patients, and therefore, the development of an<br>
organ-substitute apparatus or medicament having a function<br>
to remove toxic substances from bodies, in place of such<br>
defective organs, has become a serious problem. A method<br>
for removing toxic substances by hemodialysis as an<br>
artificial kidney is prevalent. Nevertheless, the<br>
hemodialysis-based artificial kidney requires a special<br><br><br>
apparatus, and thus, a skilled specialist is required from a<br>
safe operation standpoint. Further, blood must be taken<br>
from a patient's body, and thus, there are disadvantages in<br>
that patients must bear high physical, mental and economic<br>
burdens. Accordingly, hemodialysis is not satisfactory.<br>
Recently, as a means of remedying the above<br>
disadvantages, an oral adsorbent which can be orally<br>
administered and cure a disorder of renal and liver<br>
functions has received considerable attention. Specifically,<br>
an adsorbent disclosed in Japanese Examined Patent<br>
Publication (Kokoku) No. 62-11611 comprises a porous<br>
spherical carbonaceous substance having particular<br>
functional groups (hereinafter referred to as a surface-<br>
modified spherical activated carbon); having a high safety<br>
factor and stable to a body; and having a useful selective<br>
adsorbability, that is, an excellent adsorbability of<br>
harmful substances in the presence of a bile acid in an<br>
intestine, and a low adsorbability of useful substances such<br>
as digestive enzymes in the intestine. For these reasons,<br>
the oral adsorbent is widely and clinically used for a<br>
patient suffering from a disorder of a liver or renal<br>
function, as an adsorbent having few side effects such as<br>
constipation. The above adsorbent disclosed in Japanese<br>
Examined Patent Publication (Kokoku) No. 62-11611 was<br>
prepared by forming a spherical activated carbon from a<br>
pitch such as a petroleum pitch as a carbon source, and then<br>
carrying out an oxidizing treatment and a reducing treatment.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
The inventors of the present invention engaged in<br>
intensive research to develop an adsorbent for oral<br>
administration exhibiting a greater selective adsorbability<br>
than that of the above-mentioned oral adsorbent comprising<br>
the conventional porous sphprical carbonaceous substance<br>
prepared by forming a spherical activated carbon from a<br>
pitch and oxidizing and reducing the activated carbon, and<br>
surprisingly, found that a spherical activated carbon<br>
prepared from a thermosetting resin as a carbon source, even<br><br><br>
without the oxidizing and reducing treatments, exhibits an<br>
excellent selective adsorbability; that is, on one hand, an<br>
excellent adsorbability of β-aminoisobutyric acid which is<br>
one of the uremic substances in a body, and on the other<br>
hand, a low adsorbability of useful substances, for example,<br>
digestive enzymes, such as α-amylase, and that a level of<br>
the selective adsorbability thereof is superior to that of<br>
the adsorbent disclosed in Japanese Examined Patent<br>
Publication (Kokoku) No. 62-11611. Because the above-<br>
mentioned spherical activated carbon prepared from the<br>
thermosetting resin as a carbon source exhibits an excellent<br>
adsorbability of (3-aminoisobutyric acid, it is presumed that<br>
the above-mentioned spherical activated carbon has an<br>
excellent adsorbability of other toxic substances having a<br>
molecular weight similar to that of (3-aminoisobutyric acid,<br>
for example, octopamine or α-aminobutyric acid, or<br>
dimethylamine, aspartic acid, or arginine which is a toxic<br>
substance or a precursor thereof in a renal disease, or<br>
other water-soluble basic or ampholytic substances.<br>
It was thought that the conventional porous spherical<br>
carbonaceous substance, that is, the surface-modified<br>
spherical activated carbon used for the adsorbent disclosed<br>
in Japanese Examined Patent Publication (Kokoku) No. 62-<br>
11611, began to exhibit the selective adsorbability as above,<br>
after functional groups were introduced by the oxidizing and<br>
reducing treatments of the spherical activated carbon<br>
prepared from a pitch. Therefore, it is surprising that the<br>
spherical activated carbon prior to the oxidizing and<br>
reducing treatments exhibit a selective adsorbability, and<br>
the adsorbability per se is superior to that of the<br>
conventional adsorbent for oral administration.<br>
Further, the present inventors found that the useful<br>
selective adsorbability; that is, on one hand, an excellent<br>
adsorbability of β-aminoisobutyric acid which is one of the<br>
uremic substances in a body, and on the other hand, a low<br>
adsorbability of useful substances, for example, digestive<br>
enzymes, such as α-amylase, is improved in a surface-<br>
modified spherical activated carbon prepared by oxidizing<br><br><br>
and reducing the above spherical activated carbon, in<br>
comparison with the adsorbent disclosed in Japanese Examined<br>
Patent Publication (Kokoku) No. 62-11611. Therefore, it is<br>
presumed that the surface-modified spherical activated<br>
carbon has a greater adsorbability of other toxic substances<br>
having a molecular weight similar to that of β-<br>
aminoisobutyric acid, for example, octopamine or α-<br>
aminobutyric acid, or dimethylamine, aspartic acid, or<br>
arginine which is a toxic substance or a precursor thereof<br>
in a renal disease, or other water-soluble basic or<br>
ampholytic substances.<br>
The present invention is based on the above findings.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention relates to an<br>
adsorbent for oral administration, characterized by<br>
comprising a spherical activated carbon, wherein a diameter<br>
is 0.01 to 1 mm, a specific surface area determined by<br>
Langmuir's adsorption equation is 1000 m2/g or more, and a<br>
diffraction intensity ratio, an R value, determined by an<br>
equation (1):<br>
R=(Il5-I35)/(I24-I35) (1)<br>
wherein I15 is a diffraction intensity when a diffraction<br>
angle (29) of an X-ray diffractometry is 15°, I35 is a<br>
diffraction intensity when a diffraction angle (29) of an X-<br>
ray diffractometry is 35°, and I24 is a diffraction intensity<br>
when a diffraction angle (29) of an X-ray diffractometry is<br>
24°, is 1.4 or more.<br>
The present invention also relates to an adsorbent for<br>
oral administration, characterized by comprising a surface-<br>
modified spherical activated carbon, wherein a diameter is<br>
0.01 to 1 mm, a specific surface area determined by<br>
Langmuir's adsorption equation is 1000 m2/g or more, a total<br>
amount of acidic groups is 0.40 to 1.00 meq/g, a total<br>
amount of basic groups is 0.40 to 1.10 meq/g, and a<br>
diffraction intensity ratio, an R value, determined by an<br>
equation (1):<br>
R=(Il5-I35)/(I24-I35) (1)<br>
wherein I15 is a diffraction intensity when a diffraction<br>
angle (29) of an X-ray diffractometry is 15°, I35 is a<br><br><br>
diffraction intensity when a diffraction angle (29) of an X-<br>
ray diffractometry is 35°, and I24 is a diffraction intensity<br>
when a diffraction angle (29) of an X-ray diffractometry is<br>
24°, is 1.4 or more.<br>

BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
The spherical activated carbon or the surface-modified<br>
spherical activated carbon used as the adsorbent for oral<br>
administration of the present invention has a diffraction<br>
intensity ratio (an R value) calculated from an equation (1)<br>
of 1.4 or more, as above-mentioned.<br>
First, the diffraction intensity ratio (an R value)<br>
will be explained.<br>
When the surface-modified spherical activated carbon<br>
prepared by a conventional method disclosed in Examples 1 to<br>
3 in Japanese Examined Patent Publication (Kokoku) No. 62-<br>
11611 is investigated by a powder X-ray diffractometry, an<br>
X-ray diffraction pattern having the same tendency as that<br>
of the curve A shown in Figure 1 is obtained. The curve A<br>
per se is an X-ray diffraction pattern of the surface-<br>
modified spherical activated carbon prepared in Comparative<br>
Example 1, as mentioned below. As apparent from the curve A,<br><br><br>
a diffraction peak corresponding to a 002 plane is observed<br>
at the diffraction angle (29) of around 20° to 30°. The<br>
intensity is lowered by a decrease of the diffraction X-ray<br>
in the range where the diffraction angle (29) is higher than<br>
30°. On the other hand, in the range where the diffraction<br>
angle (29) is lower than 20°, a strong X-ray is observed<br>
even in the range where the diffraction angle (29) is lower<br>
than 15°, that is, in the range where a diffraction X-ray<br>
from 002 plane is rarely observed. Further, when the<br>
surface-modified spherical activated carbon prepared by a<br>
conventional method disclosed in Examples 1 to 3 in Japanese<br>
Examined Patent Publication (Kokoku) No. 62-11611 is<br>
investigated by a powder X-ray diffractometry after water is<br>
adsorbed, an X-ray diffraction pattern having the same<br>
tendency same as that of the curve B shown in Figure 1 is<br>
obtained. The curve B per se is an X-ray diffraction<br>
pattern of the surface-modified spherical activated carbon<br>
prepared in Comparative Example 1, as mentioned below, after<br>
water was adsorbed. As apparent from the curve B, the X-ray<br>
intensity of the curve B is considerably lowered in the low<br>
angular range in comparison with the curve A. This<br>
phenomenon can be interpreted such that the X-ray intensity<br>
in the low angular range is influenced by fine pores, and an<br>
X-ray scattering intensity is lowered by an adsorption of<br>
water into pores.<br>
As shown in Examples, as mentioned below, on the other<br>
hand, in the case of the spherical activated carbon or the<br>
surface-modified spherical activated carbon prepared by the<br>
method found by the present inventors, an X-ray diffraction<br>
pattern having the same tendency as that of the curve C<br>
shown in Figure 1 is generally obtained, in the condition<br>
that water is not adsorbed. The curve C per se is an X-ray<br>
diffraction pattern of the surface-modified spherical<br>
activated carbon prepared in Example 1, as mentioned below.<br>
That is, a scattering intensity of the curve C in the low<br>
angular range where the diffraction angle (29) is 15° or<br>
less is apparently strong in comparison with that of the<br>
curve A. Each of the curves A, B, and C in Figure 1 is<br><br><br>
standardized so that the diffraction intensity at the<br>
diffraction angle (29) of 24° becomes 100.<br>
It is apparent that a porous product with an X-ray<br>
diffraction pattern having the same tendency as that of the<br>
curve A shown in Figure 1 has a pore structure different<br>
from that of a porous product with an X-ray diffraction<br>
pattern having the same tendency as that of the curve C<br>
shown in Figure 1. Further, it is apparent from the<br>
comparison of the curve A and the curve B that a scattering<br>
intensity observed in a low angular range in the X-ray<br>
diffractometry of the surface-modified spherical activated<br>
carbon is reflected from the pore structure, and the product<br>
having a stronger scattering intensity has more pores. In<br>
the relationship between the scattering angle and the pore<br>
diameter, it is assumed that the higher the scattering angle,<br>
the finer the pore diameter. In order to analyze a pore<br>
structure, a method for determining a pore distribution by<br>
an adsorption is generally known. In many cases, however,<br>
it is difficult to accurately analyze the pore structure in<br>
view of differences in a size or shape of the pores, a size<br>
of the substances to be adsorbed, adsorbing conditions, and<br>
so on. It is an assumption of the present inventors that<br>
the scattering intensity around 15° is only slightly<br>
influenced by a diffraction X-ray from a 002 plane,<br>
influenced by a scattering from the fine pores, and becomes<br>
an index indicating the presence of ultra-fine pores which<br>
are difficult to find by the adsorption method, and that the<br>
presence of such fine pores is advantageous for adsorbing<br>
the harmful substance, β-aminoisobutyric acid. That is, the<br>
present inventors assume that the higher the scattering<br>
intensity at the diffraction angle (28) around 15°, the more<br>
effective the adsorption of the harmful substance, β-<br>
aminoisobutyric acid, for the spherical activated carbon or<br>
the surface-modified spherical activated carbon.<br>
Further, as shown in Examples, as mentioned below, the<br>
present inventors experimentally confirmed that the<br>
spherical activated carbon or the surface-modified spherical<br>
activated carbon having an X-ray diffraction pattern with<br><br><br>
the same tendency as that of the curve C shown in Figure 1<br>
exhibits a greater selective adsorbability in comparison<br>
with the conventional spherical activated carbon or the<br>
conventional surface-modified spherical activated carbon<br>
having an X-ray diffraction pattern with the same tendency<br>
as that of the curve A shown in Figure 1.<br>
In the present specification, therefore, the spherical<br>
activated carbon or the surface-modified spherical activated<br>
carbon is defined by the diffraction intensity ratio, the R<br>
value, calculated by the equation (1), to clarify the above<br>
relationship. In the above equation (1), I15 is the<br>
diffraction intensity when a diffraction angle (29) of an X-<br>
ray diffractometry is 15°; that is, in a range where a<br>
difference between the diffraction intensity of curve A and<br>
that of curve C is increased; I24 is a diffraction intensity<br>
when a diffraction angle (20) of an X-ray diffractometry is<br>
24°, that is, in a range where a difference between the<br>
diffraction intensity of curve A and that of curve C is<br>
decreased; and I35 is a diffraction intensity when a<br>
diffraction angle (29) of an X-ray diffractometry is 35°,<br>
and is used to correct a measurement error between the test<br>
samples due to background disturbances.<br>
Therefore, a diffraction intensity ratio, an R value,<br>
which is calculated by the equation (1) is<br>
R = t/u,<br>
for the curve A, and<br>
R = s/v<br>
for the curve C.<br>
The present inventors confirmed that a diffraction<br>
intensity ratio, an R value, of each of the conventionally<br>
known typical surface-modified spherical activated carbons<br>
for oral administration is less than 1.4, and did not find<br>
any known orally-administrating surface-modified spherical<br>
activated carbon having a diffraction intensity ratio, an R<br>
value, of 1.4 or more, to the knowledge of the present<br>
inventors. Further, as shown in Examples, as mentioned<br>
below, the surface-modified spherical activated carbon<br>
having a diffraction intensity ratio, an R value, of 1.4 or<br><br><br>
more, has an improved adsorbability of β-aminoisobutyric<br>
acid in comparison with the surface-modified spherical<br>
activated carbon having a diffraction intensity ratio, an R<br>
value, of less than 1.4, and thus it is apparent that the<br>
surface-modified spherical activated carbon having a<br>
diffraction intensity ratio, an R value, of 1.4 or more, is<br>
useful for the adsorbent for oral administration having an<br>
improved selective adsorbability of toxic substances.<br>
The diffraction intensity ratio, the R value,<br>
determined by an equation (1) for the spherical activated<br>
carbon or the surface-modified spherical activated carbon<br>
used for the adsorbent for oral administration according to<br>
the present invention is preferably 1.4 or more, more<br>
preferably 1.5 or more, most preferably 1.6 or more.<br>
The inventors of the present invention found that the<br>
spherical activated carbon or the surface-modified spherical<br>
activated carbon having a diffraction intensity ratio, an R<br>
value, of 1.4 or more can be prepared, using a thermosetting<br>
resin as a carbon source, instead of a pitch used as a<br>
carbon source for the conventional adsorbent for oral<br>
administration. Alternatively, it can be prepared from a<br>
pitch as a carbon source as the conventional adsorbent for<br>
oral administration, by developing a cross-linked structure<br>
during the treatment imparting infusibility, and disrupting<br>
the arrangement of the carbon hexagon network surface.<br>
In the first place, a preparing method using a<br>
thermosetting resin as a carbon source will be described.<br>
A spherical material of a thermosetting resin is<br>
initially activated at 700 to 1000°C in reactive gas stream<br>
with carbon (for example, steam or carbon dioxide gas) to<br>
obtain the spherical activated carbon used as the adsorbent<br>
for oral administration of the present invention. The term<br>
spherical "activated carbon" as used herein means a porous<br>
product prepared by a heat-treatment of a carbon precursor<br>
such as a spherical thermosetting resin, and subsequent<br>
activation, and having a spherical shape and a specific<br>
surface area of 100 m2/g or more, preferably 1000 m2/g or<br>
more in the present invention.<br><br><br>
If the spherical material of a thermosetting resin is<br>
softened by the heat-treatment and changed to an aspheric<br>
shape, or fused together by the heat-treatment, the<br>
softening can be inhibited by an oxidation at 150oC to 400oC<br>
in an atmosphere containing oxygen as a treatment imparting<br>
infusibility, before the activation as above.<br>
Further, if many pyrolysis gases or the like are<br>
generated by the heat-treatment of the spherical<br>
thermosetting resin, pyrolysis products may be removed in<br>
advance by accordingly carrying out a pre-calcination, prior<br>
to the treatment imparting infusibility.<br>
In order to further improve the selective adsorbability<br>
of the spherical activated carbon of the present invention,<br>
the resulting spherical activated carbon is subsequently<br>
oxidized at 300 to 800°C, preferably 320 to 600o0, in an<br>
atmosphere containing 0.1 to 50 vol%, preferably 1 to 30<br>
vol%, particularly preferably 3 to 20 vol% of oxygen, and<br>
then reduced by a heat-reaction at 800 to 1200°C, preferably<br>
800 to 1000oC, in an atmosphere of non-oxidative gas, to<br>
thereby obtain the surface-modified spherical activated<br>
carbon used as the adsorbent for oral administration<br>
according to the present invention. The term "surface-<br>
modified spherical activated carbon" as used herein means a<br>
porous product prepared by the oxidizing and reducing<br>
treatments of the spherical activated carbon as above,<br>
wherein acidic and basic sites are added in a well-balanced<br>
manner on the surface of the spherical activated carbon to<br>
thereby improve an adsorbability of harmful substances in an<br>
intestine.<br>
A particle diameter of the spherical product of a<br>
thermosetting resin used as a starting material is<br>
preferably about 0.02 to 1.5 mm.<br>
It is important for the thermosetting resin used as the<br>
starting material that a spherical product can be formed,<br>
and it is not fused or softened, or the shape is not changed,<br>
by a heat-treatment at a temperature of 500°C or less. A<br>
thermosetting resin which can avoid a fusion oxidation by<br>
the treatment imparting infusibility, such as an oxidation<br><br><br>
treatment, can be used.<br>
A thermosetting resin which can obtain a high<br>
carbonization yield by a heat-treatment is preferable as a<br>
starting material. If the carbonization yield is low, a<br>
strength of the spherical activated carbon becomes low.<br>
Further, undesirable pores are formed and a bulk density of<br>
the spherical activated carbon is lowered, and thus, a<br>
specific surface area per volume is lowered. Therefore, a<br>
volume to be orally administered is increased, and thus, a<br>
problem arises in that an oral administration becomes<br>
difficult. Accordingly, a thermosetting resin having a<br>
higher carbonization yield is preferable. A yield by a<br>
heat-treatment at 800°C in an atmosphere of non-oxidative<br>
gas is preferably 40 % by weight or more, more preferably<br>
45 % by weight or more.<br>
The thermosetting resin used as a starting material may<br>
be, for example, a phenolic resin, such as a novolak<br>
phenolic resin, a resol phenolic resin, a novolak<br>
alkylphenolic resin, or a resol alkylphenolic resin, or a<br>
furan resin, a urea resin, a melamine resin, or an epoxy<br>
resin. A copolymer of divinylbenzene and styrene,<br>
acrylonitrile, acrylic acid, or methacrylic acid may be used<br>
as the thermosetting rein.<br>
Further, an ion-exchange resin may be used as the<br>
thermosetting resin. Generally, an ion-exchange resin<br>
comprises a copolymer of divinylbenzene and styrene,<br>
acrylonitrile, acrylic acid, or methacrylic acid, that is, a<br>
thermosetting resin, and essentially has a structure wherein<br>
ion-exchange groups are bonded to a copolymer matrix having<br>
a three-dimensional network skeleton. The ion-exchange<br>
resin is generally classified, with respect to the kinds of<br>
ion-exchange groups, into a strongly acidic ion-exchange<br>
resin having sulfonic acid groups, a weakly acidic ion-<br>
exchange resin having carboxylic or sulfonic acid groups, a<br>
strongly basic ion-exchange resin having quaternary ammonium<br>
salts, and a weakly basic ion-exchange resin having primary<br>
or tertiary amines. In addition, so-called hybrid ion-<br>
exchange resin having both acidic and basic ion-exchange<br><br><br>
groups is included as a special ion-exchange resin. In the<br>
present invention, all of the above ion-exchange resins may<br>
be used as a starting material, but a phenolic resin is<br>
preferably used.<br>
Then, a method for preparing the spherical activated<br>
carbon or the surface-modified spherical activated carbon<br>
used as the adsorbent for oral administration from a pitch<br>
as a carbon source, by developing a cross-linked structure<br>
during the treatment imparting infusibility, and disrupting<br>
the arrangement of the carbon hexagon network plane will be<br>
described.<br>
First, a dicyclic or tricyclic aromatic compound or a<br>
mixture thereof having a boiling point of 200 °C or more is<br>
added as an additive to a pitch such as a petroleum pitch or<br>
a coal pitch. The whole is heated and mixed, and then<br>
shaped to obtain a shaped pitch. The spherical activated<br>
carbon or the surface-modified spherical activated carbon is<br>
for oral administration, and the raw material must have a<br>
sufficient purity from a safety standpoint, and have stable<br>
properties.<br>
Thereafter, the shaped pitch is dispersed and<br>
granulated in hot water, with stirring, to obtain a<br>
microspherical shaped pitch. Further, the additive is<br>
extracted and removed from the shaped pitch by a solvent<br>
having a low solubility to the pitch but a high solubility<br>
to the additive. The resulting porous pitch is oxidized by<br>
can oxidizing agent to obtain a porous pitch having an<br>
infusibility to a heat. The resulting infusible porous<br>
pitch is treated in a gas flow such as steam or carbon<br>
dioxide gas reactive with carbon to obtain the spherical<br>
activated carbon.<br>
Then, the resulting spherical activated carbon is<br>
oxidized by heating in an atmosphere containing oxygen, and<br>
thereafter, reduced in an atmosphere of a non-oxidizable gas<br>
to obtain the surface-modified spherical activated carbon<br>
used as the adsorbent for oral administration according to<br>
the present invention.<br>
In the above method for the preparation, the atmosphere<br><br><br>
containing oxygen in the particular amount may be pure<br>
oxygen, or nitrogen oxides or air as the oxygen source. As<br>
the atmosphere inert against carbon, for example, nitrogen,<br>
argon or helium may be used alone or in the form of a<br>
mixture thereof.<br>
The purposes of the addition of the aromatic compound<br>
to the raw pitch are that a flowability of the raw pitch is<br>
enhanced, whereby the granulation thereof is made easier,<br>
and the porous pitch is produced by extracting and. removing<br>
the additive from the shaped pitch, whereby a structure<br>
control and a calcination of the carbonaceous material by<br>
oxidization in the subsequent steps is made easier. As the<br>
additive, for example, naphthalene, methylnaphthalene,<br>
phenyl-naphthalene, benzyl-naphthalene, methylanthracene,<br>
phenanthrene, or biphenyl may be used alone or in a mixture<br>
thereof. An amount of the additive added to the pitch is<br>
preferably 10 to 50 parts by weight of the aromatic compound<br>
with respect to 100 parts by weight of the pitch.<br>
It is preferable that the pitch and the additive are<br>
mixed under a melted condition with heating, to achieve a<br>
homogeneous mixing. Further, it is preferable that the<br>
mixture of the pitch and the additive is shaped to form<br>
particles having a particle size of about 0.01 to 1 mm, to<br>
control the particle size (diameter) of the resulting<br>
spherical activated carbon or the surface-modified spherical<br>
activated carbon. The shaping may be conducted during the<br>
melted condition, or by grinding the mixture after it has<br>
cooled.<br>
A preferable solvent used to extract and remove the<br>
additive from the mixture of the pitch and the additive may<br>
be, for example, an aliphatic hydrocarbon, such as butane,<br>
pentane, hexane, or heptane, a mixture comprising an<br>
aliphatic hydrocarbon as a main component, such as naphtha<br>
or kerosene, or an aliphatic alcohol, such as methanol,<br>
ethanol, propanol, or butanol.<br>
The additive may be removed from the shaped mixture by<br>
extracting the additive with the solvent from the shaped<br>
mixture of the pitch and the additive, while maintaining the<br><br><br>
shape. It is assumed that, upon the extraction, through-<br>
holes of the additive are formed in the shaped product, and<br>
a shaped pitch having a uniform porosity can be obtained.<br>
Then, the resulting porous shaped pitch is subjected to<br>
a treatment imparting non-fusibility, that is, the resulting<br>
porous shaped pitch is oxidized by an oxidizing agent,<br>
preferably at room temperature to 300 °C to obtain the<br>
porous infusible shaped pitch having a non-fusibility to<br>
heat. As the oxidizing agent, for example, oxygen gas (O2) ,<br>
or a gas mixture prepared by diluting oxygen gas (O2) with<br>
air or nitrogen may be used.<br>
The spherical activated carbon or the surface-modified<br>
spherical activated carbon used as the adsorbent for oral<br>
administration of the present invention is produced by, for<br>
example, the above methods using the thermosetting resin or<br>
a pitch as a starting material, and has a diameter of 0.01<br>
to 1 mm. If the diameter of the spherical activated carbon<br>
or the surface-modified spherical activated carbon is less<br>
than 0.01 mm, an exterior surface area of the spherical<br>
activated carbon or the surface-modified spherical activated<br>
carbon is increased, and useful substances such as digestive<br>
enzymes are easily adsorbed. That is unfavorable. When the<br>
diameter is more than 1 mm, a diffusion distance of toxic<br>
substances into the inside of the spherical activated carbon<br>
or the surface-modified spherical activated carbon is<br>
increased, and an adsorption rate is lowered. That, too, is<br>
unfavorable. The diameter is preferably 0.02 to 0.8 mm. The<br>
expression that "a diameter is Dl to Du" as used herein<br>
means that a screen passing percentage (%) in a range of a<br>
screen opening Dl to Du is 90% or more in a particle-sizes<br>
accumulating standard curve prepared in accordance with JIS<br>
K 1474, as mentioned below in relation with a method for<br>
determining an average particle diameter.<br>
In the spherical activated carbon or the surface-<br>
modified spherical activated carbon used as the adsorbent<br>
for oral administration of the present invention, a specific<br>
surface area (referred to as "SSA" hereinafter) determined<br>
by Langmuir's adsorption equation is 1000 m2/g or more. When<br><br><br>
the spherical activated carbon or the surface-modified<br>
spherical activated carbon has an SSA of less than 1000 m2/g,<br>
an adsorbability of toxic substances is unfavorably lowered.<br>
The SSA is preferably 1000 m2/g or more. The upper limit of<br>
the SSA is not particularly limited, but the SSA is<br>
preferably 3000 m2/g or less in view of a bulk density and<br>
strength.<br>
In the spherical activated carbon or the surface-<br>
modified spherical activated carbon used as the adsorbent<br>
for oral administration of the present invention, a pore<br>
volume within a scope of specific pore diameters is not<br>
particularly limited. For example, the above-mentioned<br>
Japanese Examined Patent Publication (Kokoku) No. 62-11611<br>
discloses an adsorbent comprising a surface-modified<br>
spherical activated carbon wherein a volume of voids having<br>
a pore radius of 100 to 75000 angstrom, that is, a volume of<br>
pores having a diameter of 20 to 15000 nm, is 0.1 to 1 mL/g.<br>
However, in the spherical activated carbon or the surface-<br>
modified spherical activated carbon used as the adsorbent<br>
for oral administration of the present invention, a volume<br>
of pores having a diameter of 20 to 15000 nm may be 0.1 to 1<br>
mL/g, or 0.1 mL/g or less. When a volume of pores having a<br>
diameter of 20 to 1000 nm is more than 1 mL/g, an adsorbed<br>
amount of useful substances, such as digestive enzymes, may<br>
be increased. Therefore, a volume of pores having a<br>
diameter of 20 to 1000 nm is preferably 1 mL/g or less.<br>
In the spherical activated carbon or the surface-<br>
modified spherical activated carbon used as the adsorbent<br>
for oral administration of the present invention, a volume<br>
of pores having a diameter of 7.5 to 15000 nm is preferably<br>
less than 0.25 mL/g, more preferably 0.2 mL/g or less, as a<br>
more excellent selective adsorbability is thus obtained.<br>
In a constitution of functional groups of the surface-<br>
modified spherical activated carbon, that is, the product<br>
prepared by oxidizing and reducing the spherical activated<br>
carbon, which is used as the adsorbent for oral<br>
administration of the present invention, a total amount of<br>
acidic groups is 0.40 to 1.00 meq/g, and a total amount of<br><br><br>
basic groups is 0.40 to 1.10 meq/g. When the constitution<br>
of functional groups satisfies the condition that a total<br>
amount of acidic groups is 0.40 to 1.00 meq/g, and a total<br>
amount of basic groups is 0.40 to 1.00 meq/g, the selective<br>
adsorbability is improved, and particularly, the<br>
adsorbability of harmful substances is favorably enhanced.<br>
In the constitution of functional groups, a total amount of<br>
acidic groups is preferably 0.40 to 0.90 meq/g, and a total<br>
amount of basic groups is preferably 0.40 to 1.00 meq/g.<br>
When the adsorbent of the present invention is used as<br>
an agent for treating or preventing a liver or renal disease,<br>
a preferable functional-groups constitution is that the<br>
total amount of acidic groups is 0.40 to 1.00 meq/g, the<br>
total amount of basic groups is 0.40 to 1.10 meq/g, a<br>
phenolic hydroxyl group is 0.20 to 0.70 meq/g, and a<br>
carboxyl group is 0.15 meq/g or less, and a ratio (a/b) of<br>
the total amount of acidic groups (a) to the total amount of<br>
basic groups (b) is 0.40 to 2.5, and a relation [(b+c)-d]<br>
between the total amount of basic groups (b), the phenolic<br>
hydroxyl group (c), and the carboxyl group (d) is 0.60 or<br>
more.<br>
Properties of the spherical activated carbon or the<br>
surface-modified spherical activated carbon used as the<br>
adsorbent for oral administration of the present invention,<br>
namely, the average particle diameter, the specific surface<br>
area, the pore volume, the total amount of acidic groups,<br>
and the total amount of basic groups are measured by the<br>
following methods.<br>
(1) An average particle diameter<br>
A particle-sizes accumulating standard curve is<br>
prepared in accordance with JIS K 1474 for the spherical<br>
activated carbon or the surface-modified spherical activated<br>
carbon. The average particle diameter is determined from a<br>
screen opening (mm) at an intersection point with a line<br>
that is horizontal to an abscissa axis and starts from an<br>
intersection point in the particle-sizes accumulating<br>
standard curve with a perpendicular line from a 50% point of<br>
the abscissa axis.<br><br><br>
(2) A specific surface area<br>
An amount of gas adsorbed is measured by a specific<br>
surface area measuring apparatus (for example, ASAP2010<br>
manufactured by MICROMERITICS) in accordance with a gas<br>
adsorbing method for the spherical activated carbon sample<br>
or the surface-modified spherical activated carbon sample,<br>
and a specific surface area can be calculated by Langmuir's<br>
adsorption equation. More particularly, the spherical<br>
activated carbon or the surface-modified spherical activated<br>
carbon is charged as a sample in a sample tube, and dried<br>
under reduced pressure at 300°C. Thereafter, a weight of<br>
dried sample is measured. Then, the test tube is cooled to<br>
-196°C, and nitrogen is introduced into the test tube,<br>
whereby nitrogen is adsorbed to the spherical activated<br>
carbon sample or the surface-modified spherical activated<br>
carbon sample. A relation of a nitrogen partial pressure<br>
and an adsorbed amount (absorption-isotherm line) is<br>
measured.<br>
Langmuir's plotting is carried out, given that a<br>
relative pressure of nitrogen is p, and an adsorbed amount<br>
at that time is v(cm3/g STP) . That is, the plotting in a<br>
range wherein p is 0.05 to 0.3 is carried out, in the field<br>
wherein a longitudinal axis is p/v, and an abscissa axis is<br>
p. Given that the gradient at that time is b(g/cm3), a<br>
specific surface area S (unit = m2/g) can be calculated from<br>
the equation:<br><br>
wherein MA denotes a cross-sectional area of a nitrogen<br>
molecule, and is 0.162 nm2.<br>
(3) A pore volume by a mercury press-injection method<br>
The pore volume can be measured by a mercury<br>
porosimeter (for example, AUTOPORE 9200 manufactured by<br>
MICROMERITICS). The spherical activated carbon or the<br>
surface-modified spherical activated carbon is charged as a<br>
sample in a sample vessel, and degassed under a pressure of<br>
2.67Pa or less for 30 minutes. Then, mercury is introduced<br><br><br>
into the sample vessel, a pressure applied is gradually<br>
increased (maximum pressure = 414 MPa) to force the mercury<br>
into the micropores in the spherical activated carbon sample<br>
or the surface-modified spherical activated carbon sample.<br>
A pore volume distribution of the spherical activated carbon<br>
sample or the surface-modified spherical activated carbon<br>
sample is measured from a relationship between the pressure<br>
and an amount of forced mercury, by equations as mentioned<br>
below.<br>
Specifically, a volume of mercury inserted into the<br>
spherical activated carbon sample or the surface-modified<br>
spherical activated carbon sample while a pressure applied<br>
is increased from a pressure (0.06 MPa) corresponding to a<br>
pore diameter of 22 urn to the maximum pressure (414 MPa)<br>
corresponding to a pore diameter of 3 nm is measured. A<br>
pore diameter can be calculated as follows. When mercury is<br>
forced into a cylindrical micropore having a diameter (D) by<br>
applying a pressure (P), a surface tension (y) of mercury is<br>
balanced with a pressure acting on a section of the<br>
micropore, and thus, the following equation is held:<br>
-nDγcosθ = n(D/2)2•P<br>
wherein 6 is a contact angle of mercury and a wall of the<br>
micropore. Therefore, the following equation:<br>
D = (-4γcosθ)/P<br>
is held.<br>
In the present specification, the relationship between<br>
the pressure (P) and the pore diameter (D) is calculated by<br>
the equation:<br>
D = 1.27/P<br>
given that a surface tension of mercury is 484 dyne/cm, a<br>
contact angle of mercury and carbon is 130°, a unit of the<br>
pressure P is MPa, and a unit of the pore diameter D is μm.<br>
The volume of pores having a pore diameter of 20 to 1000 nm<br>
in the present invention corresponds to a volume of mercury<br>
inserted by applying a pressure increasing from 1.27 MPa to<br>
63.5 MPa.<br>
(4) Diffraction intensity ratio, R value<br>
A spherical activated carbon sample or a surface-<br><br><br>
modified spherical activated carbon sample is dried at 120°C<br>
for 3 hours under reduced pressure, and charged in an<br>
aluminum sample plate, that is, a plate (35 x 50 mm2; t= 1.5<br>
mm) having an opening of 20 x 18 mm2. Then, diffraction<br>
intensities I15/ I24, and I35 at diffraction angles (29) of<br>
15°, 24°, and 35° are measured by a reflection type x-ray<br>
diffractometer method, using a CuKα ray (wave length, A =<br>
0.15418) monochromatized by a graphite monochrometor, as a<br>
radiation source. The conditions of an X-ray generating<br>
device and a slit are as follows: voltage applied = 40 kV,<br>
current = 100 mA, divergent slit = 1/2°, photo-receiver slit<br>
=0.15 mm, and scattering slit = 1/2°. The diffraction<br>
pattern was not corrected with respect to a Lorentz<br>
polarization factor, absorption factor, atomic scattering<br>
factor or the like, but the diffraction angle was corrected,<br>
using (111) diffraction line of high-purity silicon powder<br>
for a standard substance.<br>
(5) Total amount of acidic groups<br>
The total amount of acidic groups is an amount of<br>
NaOH consumed, which may be determined by adding 1 g of<br>
the spherical activated carbon sample or the surface-<br>
modified spherical activated carbon sample, after being<br>
crushed to form particles having a size of 200 mesh or<br>
less, to 50 mL of a 0.05N NaOH solution; shaking the<br>
mixture for 48 hours; then filtering out the spherical<br>
activated carbon sample or the surface-modified spherical<br>
activated carbon sample; and titrating until<br>
neutralization.<br>
(6) Total amount of basic groups<br>
The total amount of basic groups is an amount of HC1<br>
consumed, which may be determined by adding 1 g of the<br>
spherical activated carbon sample or the surface-modified<br>
spherical activated carbon sample after being crushed to<br>
form particles having a size 200 mesh or less, to 50 mL of a<br>
0.05N HC1 solution; shaking the mixture for 24 hours; then<br>
filtering out the spherical activated carbon sample or the<br>
surface-modified spherical activated carbon sample; and<br>
titrating until neutralization.<br><br><br>
As shown in Examples mentioned as below, the spherical<br>
activated carbon or the surface-modified spherical activated<br>
carbon used as the adsorbent for oral administration of the<br>
present invention exhibits an excellent selective<br>
adsorbability, that is, an excellent adsorbability of<br>
exacerbation factors of liver diseases or harmful substances<br>
of renal diseases, but a lower adsorbability of useful<br>
substances such as digestive enzymes, and therefore, may be<br>
used as an adsorbent for oral administration for treating or<br>
preventing a renal disease or a liver disease.<br>
As the renal disease, there may be mentioned, for<br>
example, chronic renal failure, acute renal failure, chronic<br>
pyelonephritis, acute pyelonephritis, chronic nephritis,<br>
acute nephritic syndrome, acute progressive nephritic<br>
syndrome, chronic nephritic syndrome, nephrotic syndrome,<br>
nephrosclerosis, interstitial nephritis, tubulopathy, lipoid<br>
nephrosis, diabetic nephropathy, renovascular hypertension,<br>
or hypertension syndrome, or secondary renal diseases caused<br>
by these primary diseases, or a light renal failure before a<br>
dialysis therapy, and may be used in an improvement of a<br>
light renal failure before a dialysis therapy or a disease<br>
condition for a patient during a dialysis therapy (see<br>
"Clinical Nephrology", Asakura-shoten, Nishio Honda,<br>
Kenkichi Koiso, and Kiyoshi Kurokawa, 1990; and "Nephrology"<br>
Igaku-shoin, Teruo Omae and Sei Fujimi, ed., 1981).<br>
As the liver disease, there may be mentioned, for<br>
example, fulminant hepatitis, chronic hepatitis, viral<br>
hepatitis, alcoholic hepatitis, hepatic fibrosis, liver<br>
cirrhosis, hepatic cancer, autoimmune hepatitis, drug<br>
allergic hepatopathy, primary biliary cirrhosis, tremor,<br>
encephalopathia, dysbolism, or dysfunction. Further, the<br>
porous spherical carbonaceous substance can be used in a<br>
treatment of a disease caused by toxic substances in a body,<br>
such as psychosis.<br>
Therefore, when the adsorbent for oral administration<br>
is used as an agent for treating or preventing a renal<br>
disease, it contains the spherical activated carbon or the<br>
surface-modified spherical activated carbon as an effective<br><br><br>
component. When the adsorbent for oral administration<br>
according to the present invention is used as an agent for a<br>
treatment of a liver or renal disease, a dosage thereof<br>
depends on the subject (human or other animal), age,<br>
individual differences, disease conditions, and so on.<br>
Therefore, in some cases, a dosage outside of the following<br>
dosage may be appropriate, but in general, the oral dosage<br>
in the case of a human is usually 1 to 20 g of the adsorbent<br>
per day, wherein the daily dosage may be divided into three<br>
to four portions. The dosage may appropriately vary with<br>
the disease conditions. The formulation may be administered<br>
in any form, such as powders, granules, tablets, sugar-<br>
coated tablets, capsules, suspensions, sticks, divided<br>
packages, or emulsions. In the case of capsules, the usual<br>
gelatin capsules, or if necessary, enteric capsules may be<br>
used. In the case of tablets, the formulations must be<br>
broken into the original fine particles inside the body.<br>
The adsorbent may be used as a mixture with an electrolyte-<br>
controlling agent, such as an aluminum gel or Kayexalate.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
The present invention now will be further illustrated<br>
by, but is by no means limited to, the following Examples.<br>
In the following Examples, an adsorption test of α-<br>
amylase and an adsorption test of DL-β-aminoisobutyric acid<br>
were carried out in accordance with the following methods,<br>
and the selective adsorption rate was calculated by the<br>
following method.<br>
(1) Adsorption test of α-amylase<br>
The spherical activated carbon sample or the surface-<br>
modified spherical activated carbon sample was dried, and<br>
0.125 g of the dried sample was accurately weighed and<br>
charged into a conical flask equipped with a ground-in<br>
stopper. On the other hand, 0.100 g of a-amylase (liquefied<br>
type) was accurately weighed and dissolved by adding a<br>
phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) to prepare a stock solution having<br>
an accurate volume of 1000 mL. The stock solution in an<br>
accurate amount of 50 mL was charged to the conical flask<br><br><br>
equipped with a ground-in stopper. The flask was shaken at<br>
37+1 °C for 3 hours. The product in the flask was filtered<br>
with suction through a 0.65 μm membrane filter. A first<br>
filtrate (about 20 mL) was discarded, and a subsequent<br>
filtrate (about 10 mL) was taken as a sample solution.<br>
Further, the same procedures were repeated except that<br>
only a phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) was used, to obtain a<br>
filtrate as a correction solution. The sample solution and<br>
the correction solution were analyzed by an absorptiometeric<br>
analysis, using a phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) as a control.<br>
The absorbance at a wavelength of 282 nm was measured. A<br>
difference between the absorbance of the sample solution and<br>
the absorbance of the correction solution was taken as a<br>
test absorbance.<br>
A standard curve was prepared by adding the α-amylase<br>
stock solution in an accurate amount of 0 mL, 25 mL, 50 mL,<br>
75 mL, or 100 mL to a measuring flask, adding a phosphate<br>
buffer (pH 7.4) to 100 mL, and measuring an absorbance at a<br>
wave length of 282 nm. From the test absorbance and the<br>
standard curve, an amount (mg/dL) of a-amylase remaining in<br>
the solution was calculated.<br>
To measure a dependence on an amount of the spherical<br>
activated carbon sample or the surface-modified spherical<br>
activated carbon sample, the same procedures were repeated<br>
except that an amount of the spherical activated carbon<br>
sample or the surface-modified spherical activated carbon<br>
sample used was 0.500 g, and the test absorbance was<br>
measured and the amount of a-amylase remaining in the<br>
solution was calculated as above.<br>
(2) Adsorption test of DL-β-aminoisobutyric acid<br>
The spherical activated carbon sample or the surface-<br>
modified spherical activated carbon sample was dried, and<br>
2.500 g of the dried sample was accurately weighed and<br>
charged into a conical flask equipped with a ground-in<br>
stopper. On the other hand, 0.100 g of DL-β-aminoisobutyric<br>
acid was accurately weighed and dissolved by adding a<br>
phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) to prepare a stock solution having<br>
an accurate volume of 1000 mL. The stock solution in an<br><br><br>
accurate amount of 50 mL was charged to the conical flask<br>
equipped with a ground-in stopper. The flask was shaken at<br>
37±1 °C for 3 hours. The product in the flask was filtered<br>
with suction through a 0.65 urn membrane filter. A first<br>
filtrate (about 20 mL) was discarded, and a subsequent<br>
filtrate (about 10 mL) was taken as a sample solution.<br>
Then, 0.1 mL of the sample solution was accurately<br>
weighed and charged in a test tube. A phosphate buffer (pH<br>
8.0) was added in an accurate amount of 5 mL thereto, and<br>
the whole was mixed. Thereafter, a solution prepared by<br>
dissolving 0.100 g of fluorescamine in 100 mL of acetone<br>
(for a non-aqueous titration) was added in an accurate<br>
amount of 1 mL, and the whole was mixed and allowed to stand<br>
for 15 minutes. The resulting solution was analyzed by<br>
fluorometry, and the fluorescence was measured at an<br>
exciting wavelength of 390 nm and a fluorescent wavelength<br>
of 475 nm.<br>
A standard curve was prepared by producing 100 mL of a<br>
mixture of 0 mL, 15 mL, 50 mL, 75 mL, and 100 mL of the DL-<br>
p-aminoisobutyric acid stock solution and the balance of a<br>
phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), stirring and filtering the<br>
mixture, charging the resulting filtrate in an accurate<br>
amount of 0.1 mL to a test tube, adding a phosphate buffer<br>
(pH 8.0) in an accurate amount of 5 mL, mixing the whole,<br>
adding a solution (an accurate amount: 1 mL) prepared by<br>
dissolving 0.100 g of fluorescamine in 100 mL of acetone<br>
(for a non-aqueous titration), mixing the whole, allowing to<br>
stand for 15 minutes, analyzing the resulting solution by<br>
fluorometry, and measuring the fluorescence at an exciting<br>
wavelength of 390 nm and a fluorescent wavelength of 475 nm.<br>
Finally, an amount (mg/dL) of DL-^-aminoisobutyric acid<br>
remaining in the solution was calculated, using the standard<br>
curve.<br>
To measure a dependence on an amount of the spherical<br>
activated carbon sample or the surface-modified spherical<br>
activated carbon sample, the same procedures were repeated<br>
except that an amount of the spherical activated carbon<br>
sample or the surface-modified spherical activated carbon<br><br><br>
sample used was 0.500 g, and the test fluorescence was<br>
measured and the amount of DL-p-aminoisobutyric acid<br>
remaining in the solution was calculated as above.<br>
(3) The selective adsorption rate<br>
The selective adsorption rate was calculated from an<br>
amount of α-amylase remaining in the solution in the<br>
adsorption test of a-amylase wherein an amount of the<br>
spherical activated carbon sample used or the surface-<br>
modified spherical activated carbon sample used was 0.500 g,<br>
and an amount of DL-p-aminoisobutyric acid remaining in the<br>
solution in the adsorption test of DL-p-aminoisobutyric acid,<br>
wherein an amount of the spherical activated carbon sample<br>
used or the surface-modified spherical activated carbon<br>
sample used was 0.500 g, using the equation:<br>
A = (10-Tr)/(10-Ur)<br>
wherein A denotes the selective adsorption rate, and Tr<br>
denotes an amount of DL-p-aminoisobutyric acid remaining in<br>
the solution, and Ur denotes an amount of a-amylase<br>
remaining in the solution.<br>

then, reduced at 900°C for 17 minutes on the fluidized bed<br>
at an atmosphere of nitrogen gas to obtain the surface-<br>
modified spherical activated carbon.<br>
Diffraction intensities of the resulting surface-<br>

1.77.<br>
The properties of the resulting surface-modified<br>
spherical activated carbon are listed in Tables 1 and 2.<br>
EXAMPLE 5<br>
The procedure described in Example 3 was repeated,<br>

quinoline insoluble contents = not more than 1% by weight;<br>
ratio of hydrogen atoms/carbon atoms = 0.63) and naphthalene<br>
(32 kg) were charged into an autoclave (internal volume =<br>
300 L) equipped with stirring fans, melted at 180°C, and<br>
mixed. The mixture was extruded at 80 to 90°C to form<br>
string-like shaped products. Then, the string-like shaped<br>
products were broken so that a ratio of a diameter to a<br>
length became about 1 to 2.<br>
The resulting broken products were added to an aqueous<br>
solution prepared by dissolving 0.23% by weight of polyvinyl<br>
alcohol (saponification value = 88%) and heating to 93°C,<br>
and dispersed with stirring to be spheroidized. Then, the<br>
whole was cooled by replacing the polyvinyl alcohol aqueous<br>
solution with water, at 20°C for 3 hours, whereby the pitch<br>
was solidified and naphthalene crystals were precipitated,<br>
and a slurry of spherical shaped products of pitch was<br>
obtained.<br>
After most of the water was removed by filtration, the<br>
naphthalene in the pitch was extracted and removed with n-<br>
hexane at an amount of about 6 times that of the spherical<br>
shaped products of pitch. The resulting porous spherical<br>
pitch was heated to 235°C by passing a heated air in a<br>
fluidized bed, and allowed to stand at 235°C for 1 hour, to<br>
thereby be oxidized, and a porous spherical oxidized pitch<br>
was obtained, which is non-fusible to heat. The resulting<br>
porous spherical oxidized pitch had an oxygen content of 14%<br>
by weight.<br>
Thereafter, the resulting porous spherical oxidized<br>
pitch was activated in a fluidized bed at 900°C for 170<br>
minutes by a nitrogen gas atmosphere containing 50% by<br>
volume of steam to obtain a spherical activated carbon.<br>
Further, the resulting spherical activated carbon was<br>
oxidized in the fluidized bed at 470°C for 195 minutes by a<br>
nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere containing 18.5% by volume of<br><br><br>
oxygen, and reduced in the fluidized bed at 900°C for 17<br>
minutes by a nitrogen gas atmosphere, to obtain a surface-<br>
modified spherical activated carbon.<br>

modified spherical activated carbon were 647 cps at a<br>
diffraction angle (29) of 15°, 84 cps at a diffraction angle<br>
(29) of 35°, and 546 cps at a diffraction angle (29) of 24°.<br>

COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE 2<br>
The procedure described in Comparative Example 1 was<br>
repeated, except that the oxidizing and reducing treatment<br>
of the spherical activated carbon were not carried out, to<br>
obtain the spherical activated carbon.<br>
Diffraction intensities of the resulting surface-<br>

The Hg pore volume in Table 1 was determined by a<br>
mercury press-injection method and corresponds to a volume<br>
of pores having a diameter of 20 to 1000 nm.<br>
The SSA (BET) in Table 1 is a found value of a specific<br>
surface area listed as a reference, and determined by the<br>
following method.<br>
As the method for determination of a specific surface<br>
area by Langmuir's adsorption equation, nitrogen is adsorbed<br>
to the spherical activated carbon sample or the surface-<br>
modified spherical activated carbon sample at -196°C, and a<br>
relation of a nitrogen partial pressure and an adsorbed<br>
amount (absorption isotherm) is measured.<br>
BET plotting is carried out, given that a relative<br>
pressure of nitrogen is p, and an adsorbed amount at that<br>
time is v (cm3/g STP) . That is, the plotting in a range<br>
wherein p is 0.05 to 0.3 is carried out, in the field<br>
wherein a longitudinal axis is p/(v(l-p)), and an abscissa<br>
axis is p. From the gradient at that time of b (unit =<br><br>
g/cm3) , and an intercept of c (unit = g/cm3) , a specific<br>
surface area S (unit = m2/g) can be calculated from the<br>
equation:<br><br>
wherein MA denotes a cross-sectional area of a nitrogen<br>
molecule, and was 0.162 nm2.<br><br>
Test 1 for confirming pharmacological effects: Function to<br>
improve a renal disease<br>
Renal failure model rats induced by subtotal<br>
nephrectomy of 3/4 kidney were used to carry out a test for<br>
confirming pharmacological effects on a renal failure by an<br>
administration of the adsorbent for oral administration of<br>
the present invention. The adsorbents prepared in Examples<br>
1 and 3 according to the present invention were used as a<br>
sample. After six weeks from the induction to produce model<br>
rats, the rats were divided into a control group (6 rats;<br>
hereinafter referred to as a C1 group), a group to which the<br>
adsorbent prepared in Example 1 was administered (6 rats;<br>
hereinafter referred to as a P1 group), and a group to which<br>
the adsorbent prepared in Example 3 was administered (6<br>
rats; hereinafter referred to as a P2 group), so that there<br><br><br>
was no major imbalance therebetween.<br>
A powdery feed was administered to the rats of the<br>
groups. An amount of the feed given to the rats of the<br>
groups was determined on the basis of an average amount of<br>
feed taken by the rats of the C1 group for 2 or 3 days. A<br>
mixed feed containing 5% by weight of the adsorbent for oral<br>
administration in the same powdery feed as that administered<br>
to the C1 group was administered to the rats of the P1 and<br>
P2 groups. After 8 weeks from the beginning of the<br>
administration of the adsorbents for oral administration,<br>
serum creatinine, urea-nitrogen, urinary creatinine,<br>
creatinine clearance, and an amount of protein excreted were<br>
measured. Further, a same test was carried out for six<br>
normal rats in which subtotal nephrectomy was not conducted<br>
(normal group).<br>
The results are shown in Figures 6 to 9. In the P1 and<br>
P2 groups, serum creatinine (Figure 6) and urea-nitrogen<br>
(Figure 7) were significantly lowered, respectively, in<br>
comparison with the C1 group, after 8 weeks from the<br>
beginning of the administration. As to creatinine clearance<br>
(Figure 8), which is an index of a renal function, a<br>
reduction was recognized in the C1 group, whereas a<br>
significant inhibition of the reduction in the C1 group was<br>
observed in the P1 and P2 groups. Further, as to the amount<br>
of protein excreted (Figure 9), an index of a function of a<br>
nephric tubules, an increase was recognized in the C1 group,<br>
whereas a significant inhibition of the increase in the C1<br>
group was observed in the P1 and P2 groups. In addition,<br>
similar results were observed for urinary creatinine.<br>
It is apparent from the above results that the<br>
adsorbent for oral administration of the present invention<br>
can inhibit a progress of a chronic renal failure, improve a<br>
chronic renal failure, prevent a renal hypofunction, or<br>
maintain a renal function.<br>
Test 2 for confirming pharmacological effects: Function to<br>
improve a liver disease<br>
Hepatitis model rats induced by carbon tetrachloride<br>
were used to carry out a test for confirming pharmacological<br><br><br>
effects on a liver disease by an administration of the<br>
adsorbent for oral administration of the present invention.<br>
The adsorbents prepared in Examples 1 and 3 according to the<br>
present invention were used as a sample.<br>
More particularly, carbon tetrachloride was<br>
subcutaneously administered at an amount of 12 mg/kg twice a<br>
week to Sprague-Dauley rats (produced by Clea Japan, Inc.;<br>
male; 7 weeks old), continuously for about 4 months until<br>
the end of the test for confirming pharmacological effects.<br>
After two months from the beginning of the administration of<br>
carbon tetrachloride, a reduction of liver function was<br>
confirmed, and thus, the rats were divided into a control<br>
group (6 rats; hereinafter referred to as a C2 group), a<br>
group to which the adsorbent prepared in Example 1 was<br>
administered (6 rats; hereinafter referred to as a Ql group),<br>
and a group to which the adsorbent prepared in Example 3 was<br>
administered (6 rats; hereinafter referred to as a Q2 group),<br>
so that there was no major imbalance therebetween with<br>
respect to pathosis.<br>
A powdery feed was administered to the rats of the<br>
groups. An amount of the feed given to the rats of the<br>
groups was determined on the basis of an average amount of<br>
feed taken by the rats of the C2 group for 2 or 3 days. A<br>
mixed feed containing 5 % by weight of the adsorbent for<br>
oral administration in the same powdery feed as that<br>
administered to the C2 group was administered to the rats of<br>
the Ql and Q2 groups for 2 months after the division to the<br>
groups. Further, a same test was carried out for six normal<br>
rats to which carbon tetrachloride was not administered<br>
(normal group).<br>
For about two months from the beginning of the<br>
administration of the adsorbent for oral administration to<br>
the end of the administration test, ICG (Indocyanine green),<br>
GOT (glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase), and GPT (glutamic-<br>
pyruvic transaminase) were measured. The results obtained<br>
after two months from the beginning of the administration of<br>
the adsorbent for oral administration are shown in Figure 10<br>
(ICG), Figure 11 (GOT), and Figure 12 (GPT). Comparing the<br><br>
ICG test reflecting hepatic mesenchymal functions, the Ql<br>
and Q2 groups showed significantly lower values than the C2<br>
group. Further, the Ql and Q2 groups showed significantly<br>
lower values than the C2 group, as to GOT and GPT which are<br>
leakage of cellular enzymes.<br>
It is apparent from the above results that the<br>
adsorbent for oral administration of the present invention<br>
can improve a deterioration of liver functions.<br>
