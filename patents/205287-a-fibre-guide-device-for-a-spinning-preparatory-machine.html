Device at a spinning preparation machine, particularly carding machine, drawing frame or equivalent with a fibre control<br>
agent.<br>
The invention refers to a device in a spinning preparation machine, particularly carding machine, drawing frame or equivalent with a fibre control agent from at least one non moving guiding wall for guiding of a fibre structure out of at least one fibre band whose walls at least partly running together (tapered)  are built up guiding together the inflowing fibre structure and in which a withdrawing rotatable roller pair wit: circle forming bent sleeve surface is present, wherein guiding walls enter the roller gaps.<br>
At the outlet of a carding machine the combined fleece is introduced in a sliver funnel with a tapered together runningly formed internal wall surface, out of which it is taken off as a concentrated fibre band. At drafting outlet the drafted fibre bands are likewise introduced in a -s-lxver funnel with tapered internal wall surface and at its outlet are taken off as concentrated drafter sliver. The sliver funnel is always built as single piece.<br>
In a known device, at the entry-of a drafting frame as fibre control agent a sliver guide for a multiple number of fibre bands is provided whose outlet- is assigned to the roller gap of draw off rollers. Two walls of- sliver guide are built as running together (tapered). The sliver guide is built in single piece and display two sÂ±de walls, a cover wall and a ground wall Disadvantageous is th-at the fifere structure, rubs along on all sides the non-moving wail surfaces. Through the closed design of the sliver guide.,., "a getting out of the way of fibre structure is not possible. Alisx&gt; an escaping of outgoing air on ground of concentration while together guiding is only<br><br>
2<br>
possible through inlet and outlet. Finally it is a constraint that in a change of fibre band number due to rigid non-moving walls a fitting of sliver guide is complicated. Also the threading of fibre bands in and through the sliver guide is time and work consuming.<br>
The assignment lies at the base of the invention to create a device of type described at the entry which avoids the mentioned disadvantages,- which allows in particular a flexible fitting and allows an improved together guiding of fibre, band.<br>
Through that, that the movable sleeve surfaces of both the rotatable delivery rollers fotfm two wall surfaces of fibre control agent, the friction with the fibre structure is reduced. Besides through the actions as per invention a dodging of fibre structure is possible through which a flexible fitting is realised.With, advantage, also the air emerging out of the fibre structure on ground of concentration can be removed through the open area. Also the threading of fibre structure in and through the fibre control agent is essentially made easy and can be carried out in short period.  The simpler and quicker laying in of a new fibre band reduces the operation interruptions and makes possible a higher productivity.<br>
Functionally the side walls are built tapered to each, other Preferably, the side walls show a bent guiding surfac-e. With advantage, at least one side wall in operation is non-moving. Preferably the distance between the side walls is adjustable.  Functionally the planes through the roller gap between the delivery rollers and planes through the gap between the side walls are arranged in a right angle to each other.<br>
Preferably the side walls are independent to each other, With advantage the side walls cover a section piece for ex-ample-an extruding press section, processing section. Preferably the side walls are spring loaded for example laminated spring, pressur-e springs or tension spring. Functionally the inside wall surfaces of fibre control agents are formed out of two sleeve surfaces- of<br><br>
-3-<br>
delivery rollers and two bent surfaces of side walls. Preferably at least one side wall can be shifted. With advantage at least one side wall can be swivelled for example on a swivel joint. Preferably the side walls are rested' in a housing or equivalent.<br>
The invention covers an^aivantageous device having<br>
a spinning preparation machine particularly carding machine, frame with a fibre control agent out of at least one guiding element for guiding of a fibre structure from at least its fibre band whose side walls are built tapered together guiding the in flowing fibre structure and at which a draw off roller pair is present, wherein the side walls enter the roller gaps, in which for measurement of counts of fibre structure a mechanically scanning measuring agent is present and in which the cover and ground surfaces of guiding element are formed through the sleeve surfaces of draw off rollers and the measuring agent is allocated to at least one of the side walls. Functionally the measuring agent is path lacking. Preferably the measuring agent covers a piezoelectronic pressure sensor. With advantage the measuring agent covers the strain gauge. Preferably the measuring agent is path dependent. Functionally an inductive measuring agent for example immersion bobbin with a slug is present. Preferably the surface of draw off rollers are sectioned for example serrated, goffered, roughened, trimmed or equivalent. Through that seizing contact and the conveying in relation to fibre structure is improved.<br>

As per Fig. 2.,. a drafting frame for example Triitzschler-drafting frame HSK shows a drafting device 17 to which a drafting device in flow is-prelaid and drafting device 19 is post laid. The fibre bands 20 cx&gt;ming out of can enter the sliver guide .21 and pulled through -the draw off roller 22 T 23 are transported past the measuring element -24.- The drafting device 17 is conceived as 4 over 3 drafting device that-.means it consists of 3 bottom rollers I, II, III (I - withdrawal bottom roller, II - middle bottom roller, Ill-bottom feed roirer) -and four top rollers 25, 26, 27, 28. In drafting device 17, draft-ing of fibre bands 20 takes place out of mutiple fibre bands* The-drafting forms together out of break draft and preferential draft. The roller pairs 28/111 and 27/II form the break drafting<br><br>
-S-<br>
zone and the roller pairs 27/H and 25, 26/1 form the preferential drafting zone. The drafted fibre bancLs 29 reach in drafting device in flow a web guide 30 and through the draw-off rollers 31,52, are pulled in form of bundle $8 through a sliver funnel 34 in which it is united to a fibre band 35 which is foliowingly deposited in Can.<br>
The draw off rollers 31, 32 the bottom feed roller III and the middle bottom roller II which are mechanically coupled over toothed type belt are driven by the variable speed motor 36 wherein a set value is to be provided, (The associated top rollers 28 or rather 27 run along). The withdrawal bottom rollers I and draw off rollers 31t 32 are driven by the main motor 37. The variable speed control motor 36 and the main motor 37has each at their disposal an internal controller 38 or rather 39. The control (speed control) takes place always over a closed loop control circuit, wherein a tachogenerator is allocated to the controller 36 &amp;**
A central computer (41) (.control - and regulating device) for example microcomputer with microprocessor, trail- mits an adjustment cf set values for the variable speed motor 36 to the controller 38. The measurement values of both" measuring'agents 24 or rather 40 are transmitted during drafting process to the central computer 41. From the measurement values of in flow measuring agent 24 and from the set values for the cross section of emerging fibre band 35 the set point for the variable speed motor 36 is determined in the central computer 41. The measurement values of" outlet measuring agents 40 serve the monitoring of emerging fibre band 35 (finish band monitoring). With help of this control system, the fluctuations in cross section of input fibre band 20 through corresponding control of drafting process can be compensated or. rather an averaging of fibre band 35 is  reached.<br><br>
-6-<br>
As per Figure 3 two wall elements 45, 46 are provided which are formed out of processed section pieces. The wall elements 45, 46 are arranged at a distance of a(Fig. 4a)from each other in such a way that a vertical gap is formed. The wall surfaces 45a, 46a turned to each other are bent convex. Through that the inflowing (not represented here) fibre structure are together guided. The front surfaces 45b, 46b (only 46b represented) are bent concave. Two draw off rollers 47, 48 are post arranged to wall elements 45, 46 in working direction which are rotatable usually in direction of arrow C or rather D. The draw off rollers 47, 48 are arranged to each other at a distance b (Fig. 4b) in such a way that a vertical gap is formed. The radius of curvature of concave bent sleeve surfaces 47a, 48a are fitted to each other. In this way the planes through the gap 49 between the wall elements 45, 46 and the plane through the roll gap 50 between draw - off rollers 47, 48 are arranged to each other in a right angle. Both the side surfaces of fibre control agents are formed through stationary wall surfaces 45a, 46a of wall element 45, 46 in operation and the cover and ground surfaces of fibre control agents are built through the movable sleeve surfaces 47a^. 48a of draw off rollers 47 48 in operation .<br>
Corresponding to Figure 4a through the gap 49 and through the roller gap 50 an exit opening 5^ for the fibre structure is formed. As per Fig. 4b, between the concave surface 45b and the convex surface. 47a and between the concave surface 45b and the concave surface 48a, each a gap 52 or rather 55 is present which extends (opens) in direction of roller gap 5-0-. Through that a firm clamping or rather firm sticking of fibre materi-als in gap 52 or rather 53 is avoided. As per Figure 4c the wall elements 45, 46 in direction of arrow E,F or rather G,H are locally movable , for example can be' shifted, swivelled or equivalent. Through that :for entry of new fibre materials gap 49 are cleared and roll .gap: 50 are accessible. The fibre control agent F can be used for combination of two fibre bands wherein both the free ends of fibre bands are laid over each other in a certain area and the locations of joint are combined with each other through concentration in fibre control agent under pressure. In addition to this the wall element 45 is pushed away in direction F<br><br>
7<br>
by the wall element 46, the end of a fibre band is drafted through the roller gap 50, with the end of other fibre band super imposed, the wall element 45, in direction K is pushed back at wall element 46 and the draw off rollers 47, 48 are displaced in rotation, wherein the bands with locations of joint in and through the fibre control agent enter and step on and emerge out of opening 50. The radius of curvature of non-movable bent wall surfaces 45a, 46a due to different wall frictions in relation to locally moving wall surfaces 47a and 48 can be fitted or rather matched.<br>
As per Figure 5 the wall element 46, is steered over two laminated springs 54, 55 at a rack (56).  The free ends of laminated springs 54, 55 &amp;re allocated to the wall element 46 and let an intermediate space free inwhich a path lacking measuring agent 57 for example a piezoelectronic pressure sensor, strain gauge (Dynamo meter) or equivalent are located, which remains in engagement with the converter 46 and rack 56o<br>
Corresponding to Fig. 6 the wall element 46 is elastically steered over a laminated spring 54 at rack 56.  As per Figure 7 the wall element 46 is built as cranked lever type and fastened over a swivel joint 58 at rack 56, The path lacking measuring agent 57 allows now an extremely small steering of wall element 46 so that in operation between the wall elements 45 and 46 an essentially uniform g-ap 4?/ (see Fig.3) is present. On the lever arm 46' a change of force acts particularly in pressure fluctuation of fibre materials, in gap 49, which is transmitted on measuring agent 57 and transformed to electric impulse. The path lacking (or pathless) pressure sensitive measuring agents 57 for example strain gauge or piezo crystal, covers specially the high frequency signal parts. For a carding machine a measuring . range up to approx. 50 HZ, for a drafting frame a frequency range up to approx. 2 KHZ find application with 59 a sealing for example out of rubber is marked.  As; per Fig.8 the wall element 45 is formed as approximately U~ shaped and fastened over a stud 46 "at a rack 56.  In addition-'to this in stud 46" a through going elongated hole 60 is present through which a fastening screw 61 engages. Though adjustment  of wall element 45" -preferably out side operation- the width of gap 49 in relation to wall element 46<br><br>
8<br>
can be changed. The wall element 46 builds the measuring side As per Figure 9 the path lacking wail eiement 46 props on the" path lackxng measuring agent 57.  The wall element 45 ia fastened to two holdxng struts, 62, 63 which through opening in a stationary guxdxng element 64 are arranged engagingly to a movably formed holdxng element 65,.Parallel to guide element 65, a support element<br>
66	xs present which is fastened to a rack 56. An adjustable bolt<br>
67	engages commonly through a thread in the support element 66<br>
and xn guide element 65.  Through rotation of adjustable screw<br>
67 the width a of gap 49 can be changed.  The adjusted position<br>
of wall element 45 can be fixed through a lock nut.With 69, 70<br>
the holding elements are marked for absorption of transverse forces.<br>
Corresponding to Fig.10, the wall elements 45, 46 are commonly arranged in a holding device, which shows a top holding element 71, for example a plate or equivalent and a lower holding element 72, for example a plate or equivalent. In operation the position of wall elements 45, 46 is essentially stationary. However the wall elements 45, 46 are not present with holding elements 71 or rather 72 rigidly or rather strongly so that a - even a slight relative movement between the wall elements 45, 46 and the holding elements 71, 72 is possible.  The path lacking measuring agents 73' or rather 73" for example strain gauge are allocated to holding elements 71,72 .<br>
As per Fig.11 at rack 56 a path lacking measuring agent 57 Is brought which is propped over a combination element 74, for example out of sintered ceramic or equivalent, at a wall element 46.  A distance element, which covers an adjustable stop 75 and an adjustable bolt 76, protects the measuring agent 57 from specially mechanical over loading. With. 77 an elastic combination, essentially like a laminated spring is marked which holds through out the wall element 46 at the rack 56 and fastens.<br>
As per Fig.12, a cooling element 78 for example a Peltier element is allocated to measuring agent 57.<br>
As per Figure 13 between the wall element 46 and the measuring agent 57 a heat insulating compression member 7^ for example out "of ceramics, carbon fibre - compound material or Aoiiivaient is provided. The space between the wall element 46<br><br>
9<br>
and the rack 56, inwhich the measuring agent 57 and the compression member 74 are located is filled up with a filling mass 79j for example sealing compounds out of foam for example Silicon foam.<br>
Corresponding to Fig. 14, the wall element 4-5 is displacable in direction of arrow E,F that means adjustable and can be fixed through the bolt 61.  The wall element 46 is movable in the direction of bent arrow I,K to a very slight extent, that means path lacking. The device as per Fig.14 can show the distance element as per Figure 11.<br><br>
