				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
COMMUNICATION APPARATUS AND TRANSMISSION LINE ESTIMATION METHOD<br>
5						TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
		The present invention relates to a communication apparatus<br>
	and a transmission line estimation method. More specifically,<br>
	the present invention relates to a communication apparatus sending<br>
	and receiving data based on the characteristics of a transmission<br>
10	line between apparatuses without lowering the throughput, and a<br>
	transmission line estimation method (channel estimation)<br>
	performed by the communication apparatus, by which the<br>
	characteristics of the transmission line are estimated and<br>
	evaluated with a high precision.<br>
15<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
		In a communication method by which communication parameters<br>
	such as a subscriber and a modulation method used for transmission<br>
	and reception are determined based on estimation on the<br>
20	characteristics of a transmission line, it is important to<br>
	precisely determines the communication parameters that are suitable<br>
	for the characteristics of the transmission line in transmission.<br>
	In particular, in a communication system having attenuation<br>
	characteristics that deeply depend on the frequency (power line.<br>
25	carrier communications having a power line as a communication<br><br>
1<br><br>
	medium for example) , it is effective to use a multi-carrier<br>
	transmission line method using a subcarrier and a modulation method<br><br><br>
	the characteristics of the transmission line are deteriorated) .<br>
	Then, based on the result of this estimation on the transmission<br>
10	line, new parameters are selected, and data is sent or received.<br>
	This technique has been disclosed in, for example, JF2002-158675A.<br>
		However, in an environment in which the characteristics of<br>
	the transmission line vary periodically, the communication<br>
	parameters selected when estimating the transmission line often<br>
15	do not suit for the characteristics of the transmission line when<br>
	sending data if a timing of sending data is not synchronized with<br>
	the periodical variation of the characteristics of the transmission<br>
	line. Thus, in the above-described conventional method, the<br>
	maximum communication efficiency is not always obtained even when<br>
20	the transmission line is estimated.<br>
		Thus, as a countermeasure for this problem., a following<br>
	method has been conventionally proposed.<br>
		First, the variation cycle of the characteristics of a<br>
	transmission line is synchronized with the frame period of a<br>
25	communication system, and this variation cycle is divided into<br><br>
2<br><br>
	a plurality of sections. Next, within one frame period, the<br>
	plurality of divided sections of the transmission line are<br>
	continuously estimated section by section. Then, as a result of<br>
	the transmission line estimation, communication parameters,<br>
5	obtained in a section with the highest communication efficiency<br>
	are selected and then communications are performed. FIG- 12 is-<br>
	a process sequence of this conventional method for estimating a<br>
	transmission line.<br>
		However, in the conventional method shown in FIG- 12, there<br>
10	is the problem that the transmission line is estimated continuously,<br>
	and thus requests to estimate the transmission line and their<br>
	response messages occupy the transmission line and disturb<br>
	communications of stream data, audio data, or other data that is<br>
	supposed to be sent. Furthermore, in this conventional method,<br>
15	a time from the starting point of the frame period of the<br>
	communication system to the starting time of a transmission line:.<br>
	estimation section is different for each frame period. As a result,<br>
	when the band is guaranteed, for example, with time sharing, not<br>
	only is scheduling for transmission line estimation complicated,<br>
20	but also arises a case in which a scheduling condition cannot be-<br>
	satisfied.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
		Therefore, an object of the present invention is to provide<br>
25	a communication apparatus in which a transmission line is estimated<br><br>
3<br><br>
	apparatus performing periodical communications with another<br>
	communication apparatus via a transmission line. In order to<br>
10	achieve the above-described object, the communication apparatus<br>
	of the present invention is provided with a. communication control<br>
	portion, a transmission line estimation portion, and a<br>
	communication parameter determination portion.<br>
		The communication control portion sets the communication<br>
15	period to (Lxm/n) (L is the variation cycle of the characteristics<br>
	of a transmission line, n is an integer that is 2 or larger, and<br>
	m is an integer that is n or larger and whose greatest common measure<br>
	with n is 1} to perform communications. The transmission line<br>
	estimation portion estimates the characteristics of the<br>
20	transmission line within a time (L/n) after a certain offset time<br>
	(Lxk/h) {k is a real number that is 0 or larger) has passed since<br>
	the communication period started. The communication parameter<br>
	determination portion determines a communication parameter to be<br>
	used by the communication control portion, based on a result of<br>
25	estimation by the transmission line estimation portion .<br>
4<br><br>
		It is preferable' that the transmission line estimation<br>
	portion estimates the characteristics of the transmission line<br>
	at least n times. Furthermore, the communication apparatus may<br>
	estimate the characteristics of the transmission line at the<br>
5	initial starting up or upon detecting a change in a state of the<br>
	transmission line. A typical communication period is the period<br>
	of beacons sent from a communication apparatus serving as a base<br>
	unit. When there is a request to estimate the characteristics<br>
	of the transmission line, the communication apparatus sends a.<br>
10	request to allocate a Lime for estimating the characteristics of<br>
	the transmission line to the communication apparatus serving as.<br>
	the base unit, -and the characteristics of the transmission line<br>
	are estimated only when permission is given. This request may<br>
	be notified using the beacon frame or the polling frame to another<br>
15	communication apparatus. A typical variation cycle L of the<br>
	characteristics of the transmission line is the half cycle of the<br>
	commercial power supply cycle.<br>
		Each of the processes performed by each of the components<br>
	of the communication apparatus described above can be regarded<br>
20	as a transmission line estimation method that gives a series of<br>
	procedures. This method is provided in the form of a program for<br>
	letting a computer execute the series of procedures. This program<br>
	may be introduced in a computer in the form stored in a<br>
	computer-readable storage medium. Furthermore, a part of the<br>
25	functional blocks described above that constitute the<br><br>
5<br><br>
	communication apparatus may be realized as an LSI, which is an<br>
	integrated circuit.<br>
		As described above, according to the present invention, a<br>
	transmission line is estimated in a distributed manner by a simples<br>
5	scheduling, so that the characteristics of the transmission line<br>
	are estimated and evaluated with a high precision and thus data<br>
	can be sent and received at a high throughput without affecting<br>
	other, streams.<br>

25		BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
7<br><br>
		Hereinafter, embodiments of the present invention will be<br>
	described with reference, to the drawings-<br>
		First Embodiment<br>
		FIG. 1 is a diagram showing a configuration example of a<br>
5	communication network system using a communication apparatus l<br>
	according to a first embodiment of the present invention. In FIG. \,<br>
	in the communication network system of the present invention, a<br>
	plurality of communication apparatuses 1 are connected to each<br>
	other via a transmission line 2. The transmission line 2 way be<br>
10	either wired or wireless. This embodiment will be described using,<br>
	as. an example, the communication network system in which one of<br>
	the plurality of communication apparatuses 1 is a master unit,<br>
	and this master unit periodically transmits a beacon so as to control<br>
	the communications of the other communication apparatuses 1 (slave<br>
15	units).<br>
		The communication apparatus 1 is provided with a<br>
	communication control portion II, a transmission line estimation<br>
	portion 12, and a communication parameter determination<br>
	portion 13. The communication control portion 11 deals with most<br>
20	of the communication processes performed by the communication<br>
	apparatus 1. Basically, this communication control portion 11<br>
	performs communications with another communication apparatus 1<br>
	using communication parameters determined, by the communication<br>
	parameter determination portion 13. The transmission line<br>
25	estimation portion 12 measures the characteristics of the<br><br>
8<br><br>
	transmission line 2 at predetermined periodical timings and<br>
	estimates a state of the transmission line 2- The communication<br>
	parameter determination portion 13 sets or updates communication<br>
	parameters based on the result obtained when transmission line<br>
5	estimation portion 12 estimates the transmission line 2.<br>
		Hereinafter, a method by which the thus configured<br>
	communication apparatus 1 estimates the characteristics of a<br>
	transmission line will be described. FIGS. 2 to 4 are diagrams<br>
	each showing an example of timings at which a transmission line<br>
10	is: estimated by the communication apparatus 1 according to the<br>
	first embodiment of the present invention- FIG. 5 is a<br>
	communication sequence showing the procedure following which a<br>
	transmission line is estimated, by the communication apparatus 1<br>
	according to the first embodiment of the present invention.<br>
15		In this embodiment, a case will be described in which in<br>
	the. transmission line 2 in the communication network system, a<br>
	noise with a certain pattern (the mark X in FIG. 2) is generated<br>
	with certain intervals as shown in FIG, 2, that is, the variation<br>
	cycle of the characteristics of the transmission line corresponds<br>
20	to these certain intervals. In this case, the communication<br>
	control portion 11 in each of the communication apparatuses 1 that<br>
	constitute the communication network systemsets the beacon period,<br>
	which will be the communication period, in the following manner-<br>
	Herein, the beacon period refers to a time interval between when<br>
25	a beacon is transmitted by the master unit and when its next beacon<br><br>
9<br><br>
	is transmitted.<br>
		There is a case in which due to an influence of a power circuit<br>
	of, for example, a household electrical appliance that is connected<br>
	to a power line, the cycle of a noise pattern on the power line<br>
5	is the same as the half cycle of a commercial power supply [50 Hz<br>
	or 60 Hz) . Accordingly, when assuming a communication network<br>
	system using a power line, it is necessary to consider the<br>
	characteristics of a transmission line-that has been synchronized<br>
	with the half cycle of the commercial power supply described above<br>
10	(see sine waves in FIG. 2).<br>
		A point of the setting is that a "variation cycle L of the<br>
	characteristics of the transmission line is divided into n sets<br>
	of sections (n sections), a procedure is repeated in which<br>
	transmission line estimation is performed for only one section<br>
15	among sections in one beacon period, and thus transmission Line<br>
	estimation is performed for all of the n sections. A beacon<br>
	period T for realizing this point is set based on "T=Lxm/n", where<br>
	n is an integer that is 2 or larger, and in is in integer that is<br>
	n or larger and whose greatest common measure with n is 1.<br>
20	Furthermore an offset time is .set based on "Lxk/n", where k is<br>
	a real number that satisfies 0<k in this manner when the offset></k>
	like is set to enable a transmission line to be estimated within<br>
	one beacon period and section by section, it is possible to deal<br>
	with a variation of the transmission line quickly. It should be<br>
25	noted that the offset time can be set freely if dealing with a<br><br>
10<br><br>
	variation of the transmission line rapidly is not considered.<br>
		FIGS. 2 and 3 are examples in which n=3 and m=17. FIG. 4<br>
	is an example in which n=4 and xu=19. When assuming a communication<br>
	network system using a power line as described above, the beacon<br>
5	period T is calculated using L=8.333 msec when the commercial power<br>
	supply frequency is 60 Hz and using L=10 msec when the commercial<br>
	power supply frequency is 50 Hz. In FIGS. 2 to 1, a description<br>
	of the beacon itself has been omitted. Furthermore, regarding<br>
	the Offset time, k=l6 in FIG. 2, k=15 in FIG. 3, and k=17 in FIG- 4.<br>
10	AS seen in FIGS. 2 to 4, when the beacon period and the offset<br>
	time are set based on the above-described points, after the offset<br>
	time has passed, each of the transmission line estimation sections<br>
	does not have the same timing as that of the commercial power supply<br>
	cycle and slides therefrom. Therefore, it is possible to easily<br>
15	realize the transmission line estimation that cities not overlap<br>
	the commercial power supply cycle and that is- continuous in time.<br>
		Referring to FIG. 5, the procedure following which a<br>
	transmission line is estimated by the communication apparatus 1<br>
	will be described in detail.<br>
20		At the initial starting up such as when the power is turned<br>
	on, or upon detecting a change in the characteristics of a<br>
	transmission line, a communication apparatus 1 serving as a slave<br>
	unit (hereinafter, referred to as apparatus A) requests a<br>
	communication apparatus 1 serving as a master unit (hereinafter,<br>
25	referred to as apparatus C) to allocate a time for estimating the<br><br>
11<br><br>
	transmission line (step 1). When receiving the request to.<br>
	allocate a time for estimating the transmission Line from the<br>
	apparatus A, the apparatus C sends a beacon, to which information<br>
	on time allocation for estimating the transmission line is added,<br>
5	during the next time of sending the beacon (step 2). This<br>
	Information on the time allocation for estimating the transmission<br>
	line refers to information showing sections that can be used for<br>
	estimating the transmission line, and is typically given as the<br>
	offset time from the starting time of the beacon period.<br>
10		when receiving the beacon, to which the information on time<br>
	allocation for estimating the transmission line is added,, from<br>
	the apparatus C, the apparatus A measures the characteristics of<br>
	the transmission line based on this information, after the offset<br>
	time has passed since the beacon period started. In the example<br>
15	in: FIG. 2, the characteristics of the transmission line are<br>
	measured in a transmission line estimation, section 2/3 (the<br>
	half-tone portion 2 in the drawing). A specific method for<br>
	measuring the characteristics of the transmission line is that<br>
	the apparatus A sends a communication apparatus 1 serving as a<br>
20	slave unit of interest in the communication (hereinafter, referred<br>
	to as apparatus B) a request to estimate the transmission line<br>
	(step 3) , and receives a response, from the apparatus B, for the<br>
	request to estimate the transmission line (step 4). This<br>
	estimation on the transmission line is, for example, performed<br>
25	in the following manner.<br>
12<br><br>
		First, a predetermined estimation series as well as the<br>
	transmission line estimation request are sent from the apparatus A<br>
	to the apparatus B. Based on this estimation series, the<br>
	apparatus B calculates the receiving CNR (carrier to noise power<br>
5	ratio). Next, according to the calculated receiving CNR, the<br>
	apparatus B creates a tonemap that specifies communication<br>
	parameters such as a subcarrier to be used and a modulation method.<br>
	for each subcarrier. An example of the tonemap is shown in FIG. 6,<br>
	Herein, the tonemap is constituted by the tone-map number for<br>
10	discriminating this tonemap from other tonemaps, the subcarrier<br>
	number for identifying the subearrier of interest in this tonemap,<br>
	and information of use/non-useof the subcarrier and the modulation<br>
	factor. The information on the modulation factor of the subcarrier<br>
	may be information an the modulation type (16 QAM or 32 QAM, for<br>
15	example) or. may be the number of bit allocation of the subcarrier<br>
	("4" in the case of 16 QAM, for example) shown in FIG, 6- Then,<br>
	the apparatus B responds to the apparatus A by sending the<br>
	transmission line estimation including the tonemap. It should<br>
	be noted that the above-described multi-carrier transmission<br>
20	method is en example-, and other methods such as a spread spectrum<br>
	method also can be used. Furthermore, the information on the<br>
	receiving CNR is used for determining the communication parameters <br>
	but information other than this also can be used<br>
		with a similar process, the apparatus. A measure the<br>
25	characteristics of the transmission line in the other transmission<br><br>
13<br><br>
	line estimation sections (steps 5 to 10). In the example in FIG, 2,<br>
	the characteristics of the transmission line are measured in a<br>
	transmission line estimation section 1/3 (the half-tone portion 1<br>
	in the drawing) and a transmission line estimation section 3/3<br>
5	(the half-tone portion 3 in the drawing), With this process, the<br>
	apparatus A completes the transmission line estimation in all of<br>
	these three divided transmission line estimation sections, that<br>
	is, acquisition of the tonemaps I step 11) . Then, among the<br>
	plurality of acquired tonemaps, the apparatus a selects one tonemap<br>
10	that is optical for use in the communications-, and notifies the<br>
	apparatus B of it (step 12). With this process, the apparatuses A<br>
	and B can share the optimal tonemap. Hereinafter, the<br>
	communications are performed using this optimal tonemap.<br>
		An optimal tonemap is selected, for example, in the following<br>
15	manner- in the example in FIG. 2, a noise is generated in the<br>
	transmission- line estimation sections 1/3 and 2/3, and. a noise<br>
	is not generated in the transmission line estimation section 3/3<br>
	(see FIG, 7 partially extracting and magnifying FIG- 2).<br>
	Therefore, the tonemap of the transmission line estimation<br>
20	section 3/3.has the highest PHY rate. Accordingly, this tonemap<br>
	with the highest PHY rate is selected as the tonemap used for the<br>
	communication.<br>
		 Even without acquiring all of the tonemaps of the<br>
	transmission line estimation sections, it is possible to select<br>
25	an optimal tonentap among tonernaps that have been acquired when<br><br>
14<br><br>
	a predetermined time-out period has passed.<br>
		As described above, according to the communication<br>
	apparatus 1 of the first embodiment of the present invention, it<br>
	is possible to easily realize transmission line estimation in a<br>
5	distributed manner. Thus, the characteristics of the<br>
	transmission line are estimated and evaluated with a high precision,<br>
	and thus data can be sent and received at a high throughout.<br>
		In the first embodiment, the integers n and in are described<br>
	as fixed values, but they can be changed dynamically in accordance<br>
10	with, for example, a change in the transmission line based on the-<br>
	estimation result of the transmission line, the value of the PHY<br>
	rate., or the' degree of a variation of the PHY rate.<br>
		Furthermore, in the communication sequence shown in FIG. 5,<br>
	a relevant apparatus other than the apparatuses A, B, and C is;<br>
15	not described, but the process is performed typically as shown<br>
	in. FIG. 8.<br>
		 Referring, to FIG. 8r information on time allocation for<br>
	estimating; the transmission line is added to a beacon sent from<br>
	the apparatus C. The information on the time allocation for<br>
20	estimating the transmission line- not only specifies, for the<br>
	apparatus. A, a time during which a request to estimate the<br>
	transmission line can be sent to the apparatus B, but also prohibits<br>
	the apparatuses B, c, and others from transferring data. By<br>
	prohibiting apparatuses other than that sends the request from<br>
25	transmitting in a time during which the request to estimate the<br><br>
15<br><br>
	transmission line is sent (the half-tone period in FIG. 8), it<br>
	is possible to avoid a collision, for example, between the request<br>
	to estimate the transmission line and data.<br>
		In a time during which a response to the request to estimate<br>
5	 the transmission line is sent from the apparatus B to the<br>
	apparatus A, data transfer by the apparatuses A, B, and others<br>
	may be or may not be prohibited for the purpose of improving the<br>
	throughput in the data transfer. FIG. 8 is the communication<br>
	sequence in which data transfer is not prohibited. Herein, when<br>
10	data transfer is not prohibited, it is preferable that the response<br>
	from the apparatus B is given the highest priority.<br>
		Furthermore, instead of a manner in which the receiver<br>
	apparatus B responds to the transmitter apparatus A by sending<br>
	the transmission line estimation at each time as described above,<br>
15	the plurality of transmission line estimations may be sent at one<br>
	time, or the receiver apparatus B may select a tone-map based on<br>
	the plurality of transmission line estimations and notify the<br>
	transmitter apparatus A of the selected tonemap. In either case,<br>
	the effect of the present invention is not lost.<br>
20		Second Embodiment<br>
		The first embodiment described above is a technique assuming<br>
	that the variation cycle of the characteristics, of the transmission<br>
	line is known in advance. Then, in a second embodiment below,<br>
	a technique -will be described in which an optimal beacon period<br>
25	can be set automatically even when the variation cycle of the<br><br>
16<br><br>
	characteristics .of the transmission line is not known in advance.<br>
		FOR example, a case will be described in which the<br>
	communication apparatus 1 can set both of a beacon period T1l<br>
	(FIG. 9) when the variation cycle L of the characteristics of the<br>
5	transmission line , which is synchronized with a commercial power<br>
	supply frequency of 60 Hz, is 8.333 msec and when the integers n=3<br>
	and m=17, and a beacon period T2 (FIG. 10) when the variation<br>
	cycle L of the characteristics of the transmission line, which<br>
	is; synchronized with a commercial power supply frequency of 50 Hz,<br>
10	is 10 msec and when the variables n=3 and m=l7. In this case,<br>
	the communication apparatus 1 estimates the transmission line in<br>
	all of the identical sections within a beacon period and acquires<br>
	a plurality of tonemaps. FIGS- 9 and 10 show a case of the<br>
	transmission line estimation section 2 (the half -tone portions<br>
15	in the drawings). The offset time is given based on ""Lxk/n" (k<br>
	is a real number-that satisfies 0<k and k="l6" in figs></k>
	10.<br>
		Herein, it is assumed that the actual commercial power supply<br>
	frequency is 60 Hz.<br>
20		As a result, the variation cycle L of the characteristics<br>
	of the transmission line in the beacon period T1 is synchronized<br>
	more with a noise that is synchronized with the actual commercial<br>
	power supply frequency (6.0 Hz) in. the drawing (FIG. 9). Thus,<br>
	the characteristics of the transmission line at the transmission<br>
25	line estimation sections 2 are substantially the same, and a<br><br>
17<br><br>
	similar value for the communication parameter (PHY rate} of each<br>
	tonemap can be obtained in the plurality of acquired tonemaps,<br>
	so that it is determined that the correlation, regarding a noise,<br>
	between the beacon period T1 and the variation cycle L is high.<br>
5		On the other hand, the variation cycle L of the<br>
	characteristics of the transmission line in the beacon period T2<br>
	is not synchronized with a noise that is synchronized with the<br>
	actual commercial power supply frequency (60 Hz) in the drawing<br>
	(FIG. 10). Thus, the characteristics of the transmission line<br>
10	at the transmission line estimation sections 2 are different from<br>
	each other, and the communication parameter (PHY rate) of each<br>
	tonemap is different for each of the plurality of acquired tonemaps,<br>
	Therefore, it is determined that the correlation, regarding a noise,<br>
	between the beacon period T2 and the variation cycle L is low.<br>
15		Based on the above-described points, it is determined that<br>
	the settings of a beacon period determined to have the highest<br>
	correlation is synchronized most with a noise that is actually<br>
	being generated- Accordingly, only by selecting the settings of<br>
	the beacon period with which the correlation is high, it is possible<br>
20	to automatically set a beacon period that corresponds to the<br>
	variation cycle of the characteristics of the transmission line.<br>
		An optimal communication parameter that is noise-resistant<br>
	is selected by setting the beacon period according to the second<br>
	embodiment and then by performing the process according to the<br>
25	first -embodiment.<br>
18<br><br>
		The above-described embodiments can be realized also when<br>
	a CPU executes a program that can let the CPU execute the<br>
	above described procedure stored in e storage device (ROM., BAM,<br>
	or hard disk, for example). In this case, the program may be<br>
5	executed after being stored in the storage device via a storage<br>
	medium, or may be executed directly on the storage medium. The<br>
	storage medium here includes a semiconductor memory such as a ROM<br>
	a RAM, and a f lash memory, a magnetic disk memory such as a flexible<br>
	disk and 5 hard, disk, an optical disk such as a CD-ROM, a DVD,<br>
10	and a BD, and a memory card. Furthermore, the concept of the storage<br>
	medium also includes a communication medium such as a telephone<br>
	line and a carrier line.<br>
		 Each of the functional blocks indicated by the broken line<br>
	in FIG. 1 may be realized by an LSI, which is an integrated circuit.<br>
15	Each of the' functional blocks may be formed on a single chip one<br>
	by one, or a part or all of them may be formed on one chip. Although<br>
	an LSI is used in these embodiments, this circuit may be called<br>
	IC; system LSI, super LSI, or ultra LSI, depending on the difference<br>
	of the degree of integration.<br>
20		It should be noted that the method for forming an integrated<br>
	circuit is not limited to using an LSI, and circuit integration<br>
	may be realized by a dedicated circuit: or a general purpose processor.<br>
	Furthermore, it is. possible to use an FPGA (field programmable<br>
	gate array) that can be programmed after an LSI is produced, and<br>
25	a reconfigurable processor being capable of reconfiguring<br><br>
19<br><br>
	connections and settings of circuit cells inside of the LSI.<br><br>
	possibility of, for example, application of biotechnology.<br>
		Hereinafter, an example will be described in which the<br>
	present invention that has been described in the embodiments is<br>
	applied to an actual network system, FIG. 11 is a diagram. showing<br>
10	an example of a network system in which the present invention is<br>
	applied to high-speed power line transmission. In FIG. 11, an<br>
	IEEE/E1394 interface, a USB interface, or so forth provided in<br>
	multimedia equipment such as a personal computer, a DVD recorder,<br>
	a (digital TV, and a home server system is- connected to a power<br>
15	line via an adaptor provided with the function of the present<br>
	invention. With this configuration, it is possible to construct<br>
	a network system in which digital data such as multimedia data<br>
	can be transmitted at a high speed via a power line serving as<br>
	a medium. In contrast to a conventional wired LAN, this system<br>
20	does not require a network cable to be newly installed and can<br>
	use a power line having been installed already at home, office,<br>
	or so forth without any process as a network- line, so that a<br>
	significant convenience in terms of cost and simplicity of<br>
	installation is provided-<br>
25		 The above-described embodiment is an example in which<br><br>
20<br><br>
	existing multimedia equipment is applied to power line<br>
	communications via an adaptor converting a. signal interface of<br>
	the existing equipment to an interface of the power line<br>
	communications. In future, however, the function of the present<br>
5	invention is included in multimedia equipment, so that it becomes<br>
	possible to transmit data between the equipment via power codes<br>
	of the multimedia equipment. In this case there is no need for<br>
	the adaptor, the IEEE1394 cable, or the USB cable shown in FIG, 11,<br>
	and thus wiring is simplified. Furthermore, since connection to<br>
10	the Internet via a router or connection to a wireless/wired LAN<br>
	using, for example, a hub is possible, so that it is possible to<br>
	expand a LAN system using the high-speed power line transmission<br>
	system of the present invention. Furthermore, in the provider line<br>
	transmission method, communication data runs via a power line.<br>
15	Therefore, in contrast to a wireless LAN, there is no problem that<br>
	radio waves are intercepted, resulting in data leakage „ The power<br>
	line transmission method also has a security effect to protect<br>
	data. Data running on the power line can be protected by IPsec<br>
	in IP protocol, encoding the contents themselves, or other DRM<br>
20	methods, for example.<br>
		As described above, by installing a QoS function including<br>
	a copyright protection function by encoding the contents and the<br>
	effect of the present invention (band allocation flexibly<br>
	addressing improvement in throughput increased retransmission,<br>
25	and variation in traffic), AV contents with a high quality can<br>
