Loom, in particular a ribbon loom<br>
Technical Field<br>
The invention relates to a loom, in particular a ribbon<br>
loom, according to the preamble of claim 1.<br>
Prior Art<br>
Looms, in particular ribbon looms of the type initially mentioned, are commonly known. Usually, the thread quantity to be transported for warp threads and/or weft threads in looms is.supplied to the processing station either under negative control, to be precise tension control, or positively with a fixed mechanical setting. The disadvantage of a negative thread control is that the threads are subjected to load, particularly when threads of different quality and properties are used. In the case of rubber threads or other threads with elasticity, the negative control has to be adapted in each case, since the threads would otherwise be loaded by harmful stresses. By contrast, in the case of a positive mechanical control with a fixed setting, there is a disadvantage that the thread feeders can operate only with an adjustable constant pull which can be set only in terms of the weakest thread, with the result that the quality of the woven cloth is impaired.<br>
EP 1 526 199 A discloses a loom with individually drivable thread transport devices which can be activated individually according to the pattern program, but control takes place as a function of tension, and individual overriding adaptation is not provided.<br>
WO 2004/111322 discloses, for knitting machines, a mechanism  with  an  electronic  control  device  for<br>
 <br>
controlling the weft thread introduction, which, on the oasis of a pattern program regulates an individual thread transport for the knitted cloth to be produced. The knitting machine contains, furthermore, a correcting apparatus, by means of which an adjustable correcting factor can be superposed on the pattern-compatible functioning of components of the knitting machine.<br>
WO-A-88/05C8 9 discloses a method for regulating the warp thread tension in looms by regulating the drive speed of the warp beam and/or of the cloth beam by means of program-controlled stepping motors. However, a regulation of the weft thread tension or quantity is not disclosed, provided or suggested there. A similar method and a corresponding device for releasing and regulating the warp thread quantity is known from WO-A-91/05895, said warp thread quantity being calculated by means of a control arrangement, for example with a keyboard. However, here, too, a regulation of the weft thread tension or quantity is not disclosed, provided cr suggested.<br>
Presentation of the Invention<br>
The purpose of the invention is to improve further a<br>
loom of the type initially mentioned.<br>
The set object is achieved by means of the characterizing features of claim 1. Since in a loom, in particular in a ribbon loom, with at least one electrically driven thread transport device for at least one weft thread, with a cloth take-up for the woven cloth and with an electronic control device for controlling the loom on the basis of a pattern program for the woven cloth to be produced, there is provision for the control device to have control means in order automatically to  set,  at  the  at  least  one  thread<br>
 <br>
transport device, the delivery length of the weft thread no be supplied, this ensures, in the first place, that the exact thread length required is always available for each weft thread insertion and each pattern. There is no longer any need for taking up the weft thread, for example from a cone, by means of a weft insertion device. As a result, the woven cloth, in general, and pattern formation, in particular, are improved substantially. During the weaving operation, faults, such as thread breaks and defects, are largely prevented. Since the delivery length can be calculated not only using data from the pattern program and from the cloth take-up, but, in particular, also from data relating to the width, varying greatly during the weaving operation, of the woven cloth to be produced, the result of the measures of the invention is, moreover, that such changes can be reacted to during the weaving operation.<br>
It is advantageous in this case if the loom has an electrically driven further thread transport device for the warp threads. The control device in this case also has control means in order automatically to set at the thread transport device che delivery length of the warp threads to be supplied, according to the data predetermined in the pattern program. The delivery length of the further thread transport device for the warp threads can likewise be calculated, using data from the pattern program, the cloth take-up and the width of the woven cloth to be produced (claim 2).<br>
A development according to claim 3 is particularly advantageous, since, by means of the correcting factor Ks which additionally varies the pattern-compatible functioning data at least of the weft thread supply, further individual adaptation, for example, to different thread qualities and/or pattern properties of<br>
 <br>
the woven cloth to be produced can be achieved. Such a correcting factor KK or Ev,- is preferably also provided for the cloth take-up and/or the warp thread supply (claim 4).<br>
According to claim 5, a particularly advantageous correcting apparatus has a display screen, preferably a touch screen, and also an editing element for the manual selection of various indicator and control planes, in particular that for handling the correcting factor or correcting factors.<br>
The version of the loom according to claim 6 is advantageous when the control of the thread transport device is designed as an integrated constituent of the machine control.<br>
For a loom with weft threads of various types, in particular for weft threads of different color, it is advantageous if, according to claim 7, at least, two electrically driven thread transport devices for weft threads are provided and the control means are designed correspondingly. In this case, it is advantageous if, according to claim 8, correcting factors different for the weft threads are provided for the thread transport devices, particularly when the weft threads of different type are supplied by these thread transport devices.<br>
Brief description of the drawings<br>
Exemplary embodiments of the invention are described in<br>
more detail below by means of the drawings in which:<br>
figure 1      shows a loom in a side view;<br>
figure 2      shows  a  thread transport  device  from<br>
figure 1 in a diagrammatic illustration;<br>
and<br>
 <br>
figure 3 shows an indicator and switching plane of a correcting apparatus for setting a correcting factor.<br>
Kays of implementing the Invention<br>
Figure 1 shows a diagrarr, of a loom, which is preferably a ribbon loom, in a side view, in which warp threads 4 are opened into a shed S by means of a shedding device 6 at a weaving station 2. By means of a weft device, not illustrated in any more detail, in each case a weft thread 10 is inserted into the shed 8 during each shed opening and is beaten up at the cloth edge 12 by means of a reed, likewise not illustrated in any more detail.<br>
The woven cloth 14 produced is taken up by means of a cloth take-up 16 and rolled up into a cloth roll 18.<br>
The warp threads are supplied to the weaving station 2 by one or more warping frames 20, 20a, 2 0b, 20c. At least a number of warping frames are assigned in each case an individually controllable thread transport device 22a, 22b, 22c. At the weaving station 2, fur~her, one or more weft threads 10 can be supplied in succession, which are in each case taken up in an individually controllable way by thread bobbins 24a, 24b by means of controllable thread transport devices 2 6a, 2 6b.<br>
Figure 2 shows an example of such a thread transport device in a diagrammatic illustration, in which a motor 28, for example a stepping motor, drives via a gear 30 at least one of two rollers 32, 34, around which a thread 4, 10 to be transported is looped.<br>
The loom is equipped with a control device 3 6 which controls the components of the loom on the basis of a pattern program. Such a pattern program may be produced<br>
 <br>
either on the loom itself or on an external pattern apparatus 38, from which the pattern program is read into a reader 4 2 of the control device 3 6, for example via lines or via a floppy disk 40. The control device 36 contains control means in order to set the delivery length of the warp threads 4 to be supplied and/or of the weft threads 10 according to the cloth pattern predetermined from the pattern program. Furthermore, the control device 3 6 has a manual actuable correcting apparatus for individually superposing an adjustable correcting factor Ks or KK, which may be plus or minus, upon the delivery date of at least one weft thread 10 and of at least one warp thread 4 for at least one weft insertion. The correcting apparatus is described in more detail with reference to figure 3.<br>
The correcting apparatus contains a display screen 4 4 which is preferably designed as a touch screen and which has a row of indicator and switching elements for manually selectable indicator and switching planes. In a first switching field 46, any desired thread transport device 22a, 22b, 22c, 26a, 26b can be selected by means of selector keys 4 8a, 4 8b and then appears in the indicator field 50 - In a second switching field 52, the correcting factor Ks or KK can then likewise be set by means of selector keys 54a, 54b to a desired value which appears in the indicator field 55. In a third switching field 56, finally, it is possible to set the weft or weft region for which the correcting factor Ks or KK is set in each case is to be applicable. By means of selector keys 58a, 58b, the number of the weft xi to xn can be set, the said values then being indicated on the indicator fields 60a, 60b. An actuating key X serves for changing the indicator field or for generally resetting the settings, so that the control device controls the components solely according  to  the  pattern  program  entered.  In  the<br>
 <br>
example shown, a correcting factor Ks = 102% is set on the correcting apparatus for the thread transport device number 26a and means that the already individual normal delivery length, which is predetermined by the control means on the basis of the pattern program and amounts to 100%, is to be increased by 2%. This value will then apply to the wefts xi and x^ or xi to x2.<br>
By means of the correcting apparatus, a correcting factor Kw can be superposed not only on the normal delivery quantity of the weft threads, but, alternatively or additionally, also on the delivery quantity of one or more warp threads and/or on the speed of the cloth take-up. The correcting factors Ks, KH, KK may be identical for various components, but they are preferably different. Particularly for the thread transport devices 26a, 26b, illustrated in the exemplary embodiment, for the weft threads, a different correcting factor Ks may nave to be provided when weft threads of different type are supplied by these thread transport devices 2 6a and 2 6b. The same also basically applies in a similar way to the correcting factors KK for the thread transport devices 22a, 22b, 22c for the wart) threads .<br>
