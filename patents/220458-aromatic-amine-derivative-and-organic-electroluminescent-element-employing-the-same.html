DESCRIPTION<br>
AROMATIC AMINE DERIVATIVE AND ORGANIC ELECTROLUMINESCENT ELEMENT EMPLOYING THE SAME<br>
THECNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to an aromatic amine derivative and an organic electroluminescent element making use of the same, more specifically to an organic electroluminescent element which can emit blue light under a high temperature while maintaining a high luminous efficiency even at a low voltage and a long life and an aromatic amine derivative which materializes the same.<br>
RELATED ART<br>
An organic electroluminescent (EL) element is a spontaneous light emitting element making use of the principle that a fluorescent substance emits light by recombination energy of holes injected from an anode and electrons injected from a cathode when an electric field is applied. Since a low voltage-driven organic EL element of a laminate type was ^reported by C. W. Tang "of Eastman Kodak Company (C. W*. Tang and S. A. Vanslyke, Applied Physics Letters, Vol.<br><br>
51, p. 913, 1987), researches on organic EL elemens comprising organic materials as structural materials have actively been carried out. Tang et al. use tris(8-hydroxyquinolinol)aluminum for the light emitting layer and a triphenyldiamine derivative for the hole transporting layer. The advantages of a laminate structure include that an efficiency of holes injected into a light emitting layer can be elevated, that a forming efficiency of excited particles formed by blocking electrons inje"cted from a cathode to recombine them can be raised and that excited particles formed in the Light emitting layer can be shut up. As shown in the above example, a two layer type comprising a hole transporting (injecting) layer and an electron transporting and light emitting layer and a three layer type comprising a hole transporting (injecting) layer, a light emitting layer and an electron transporting (injecting) layer are well known as the element structure of the organic EL element.  In such laminate type structural element, an element structure and a forming method are studied in order to enhance-a recombination efficiency of holes and electrons injected.<br>
A hole-injecting material used for the above organic EL element includes, for example, high<br><br>
molecular weight aromatic amine compounds disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 301934/1997, triarylamine polymers disclosed in International Patent Publication No. 30071/1998 and phenylenediamine derivatives disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 309566/2000. All of the above compounds have a small ionization potential and therefore holes are liable to be injected from an anode. In addition thereto, they have a higher hole mobility than those of star burst amine derivatives disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 308688/1992 and are suited as a hole-injecting material.<br>
However, organic EL elements prepared by using the above hole injecting materials do not have a satisfactory heat resistance, and they can not maintain blue light emission particularly when exceeding 130 *C and are unsuitable to on-vehicle uses to which a heat resistance is required.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention has been made in order to solve the problems described above, and an object thereof is to provide an organic electroluminescent element which can emit blue light under a high<br><br>
temperature while maintaining a high luminous efficiency even at a low voltage and a long life and an aromatic amine derivative which materializes the same.<br>
Intensive researches repeated by the present inventors in order to achieve the object described above have resulted in finding that the object described above can be achieved by using a novel aromatic amine compound having a specific structure represented by the following Formula (1) as a material for an organic EL element and using it particularly as a hole injecting material, and thus they have come to complete the present invention.<br>
That is, the present invention provides a novel aromatic amine derivative represented by the following Formula (1):<br><br><br>
wherein Ar1 to Ar2 each represent a substituted or non-substituted condensed aryl group having 10 to 50 nuclear carbon atoms; Ar3 to Ar6 each represent a substituted or non-substituted aryl group having 6 to 50 nuclear carbon atoms; Ar7 to Ar10 each represent a substituted or non-substituted arylene group having 6 to 50 nuclear carbon atoms; substituents of Ar7 and Ar8 may form a ring;<br>

provided that the conditions of (1) and/or (2) are satisfied:<br>
(1)	at least one of Ar3 to Ar6 is a substituted or non-substituted condensed aryl group having 10 to 50 nuclear carbon atoms and<br>
(2)	at least one of Arx to Ar2 is a substituted or non-substituted condensed aryl group having 12 to 50 nuclear carbon atoms.<br>
Further, the present invention provides an<br><br>
organic EL element in which an organic thin film layer comprising a single layer or plural layers including at least a light emitting layer is interposed between a cathode and an anode, wherein at least one layerof the above organic thin film layers contains the aromatic amine derivative described above in the form of a single component or a mixed component.<br>

The aromatic amine derivative of the present invention can_ be used in the light emitting zone or the hole transporting zone of the organic EL element, and it is used preferably in the hole transporting zone, particularly in the hole transporting layer, whereby capable of being obtained is the organic EL element which can emit blue light under a high temperature while maintaining a high luminous efficiency even at a low voltage and a long life.<br>
An amount of the aromatic amine derivative of the present invention which is added to the light emitting zone or the hole transporting zone is<br>
preferably 30 to 100 mole %.<br>
—-* (2) Light transmitting substrate<br>
The organic EL element of the present invention is prepared on a light transmitting substrate. The light transmitting substrate referred to in this case is a substrate supporting the organic EL element, and it is preferably a flat substrate in which light in a visible region of 400 to 700 nm has a transmission factor of 50 % or more.<br>
To be specific, it includes a glass plate, a polymer plate and the like.  In particular, the glass .plate includes soda* lime glass, barium-strontium-containing glass, lead glass, aluminosilicate glass,<br><br>
borosilicate glass, barium borosilicate glass and quartz. The polymer plate includes polycarbonate, acryl, polyethylene terephthalate, polyether sulfide and polysulfone. (3) Anode<br>
An anode in the organic EL element of the present invention has a function to inject a hole into the hole transporting layer or the light emitting layer, and it is effective that the anode has a work function of 4.5 eV or more.

The anode can be prepared by forming a thin film of the above electrode substances by a method such as a deposition method or a sputtering method.<br>
When light emitted from the light emitting layer is taken out from the anode, a transmission factor of the anode based on light emitted is preferably larger than 10 %. A sheet resistance of the anode is preferably several hundred Q/D or less. A film thickness of the anode is selected, though depending on the material, in a range of usually 10 nm to 1 jim,   preferably 10 to 200 nm.<br><br>
(4) Light emitting layer<br>
The light emitting layer in the organic EL element has the following functions of (1) to (3) in combination.<br>
(1)	Injecting function: a function in which a hole<br>
can be injected from an anode or a hole injecting<br>
layer in applying an electric field and in which an<br>
electron can be injected from a cathode or an<br>
electron injecting layer.<br>
(2)	"Transporting function: a function in which a<br>
charge injected (electron and hole) can be migrated<br>
by virtue of a force of an electric field.<br>
(3)	Light emitting function: a function in which a<br>
field for recombination of an electron and a hole is<br>
provided and in which this is connected to light<br>
emission.<br>
Provided that a difference between an easiness in injection of a hole and an easiness in injection of an electron may be present and that a difference may be present in a transporting ability shown by the mobilities of a hole and an electron, but any one of the charges is preferably migrated.<br>
A publicly known method such as, for example, a deposition method, a spin coating method and an*LB method can be applied as a method for forming the<br><br>
above light emitting layer.  In particular, the light emitting layer is preferably a molecular volume film. In this case, the molecular volume film means a thin film formed by depositing a material compound staying in a gas phase state and a film formed by solidifying a material compound staying in a solution state or a liquid phase state, and the above molecular volume film can be distinguished from a thin film (molecular volume film) formed by the LB method by a difference in an aggregation structure and a higher order structure and a functional difference originating in it.<br>
Further, "as disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 51781/1982, the light emitting layer can be formed as well by dissolving a binding agent such as a resin and the material compound in a solvent to prepare a solution and then coating the solution by a spin coating method to form a thin film.<br>
In the present invention, another publicly known light emitting materials other than the light emitting material comprising the aromatic amine derivative of the present invention may be added, if necessary; to the light emitting layer as long as the object of the present invention is not damaged.<br><br>
Further, a light emitting layer containing a different publicly known light emitting material may be laminated on the light emitting layer containing the light emitting material comprising the aromatic amine derivative of the present invention. (5) Hole injecting and transporting layer (hole transporting zone)<br>

The organic EL element of the present invention may contain a reducing dopant in the region which transports an electron or an interfacial region between the cathode and the organic thin film layer. In this case, the reducing dopant is defined by a substance which can reduce an electron transporting compound. Accordingly, various compounds can be used as long as they have a reducing property of some extent/ and capable of being suitably used is at least one substance selected from the group consisting of, for example, alkali metals, alkali earth metals, rare earth metals, oxides of alkali metals, halides of alkali metals, oxides of alkali earth metals, halides of alkali earth metals, oxides of rare earth metals or halides of rare earth metals, organic complexes of alkali metals, organic complexes of alkali earth metals and organic complexes of rare earth metals.<br><br>

Among them, the more preferred reducing dopant is at least one alkali metal selected from the group consisting of K, Rb and Cs, and it is more preferably Rb or Cs.  It is most preferably Cs.

If the electron transporting layer is constituted from the above insulating thin film, the more homogeneous thin film is formed, and therefore picture element defects such as dark spots can be reduced. The above inorganic compound includes the alkali metal chalcogenides, the alkali earth metal chalcogenides, the halides of alkali metals and the halides of alkali earth metals each described above. (7) Cathode<br>

According to the materials and the forming methods which have been exemplified above, the anode, the light emitting layer, if necessary, the hole injecting and transporting layers and, if necessary, the electro injecting and transporting layers are formed, and further the cathode is formed, whereby the organic EL element can be prepared. Also, the organic EL element can be prepared from the cathode to the anode in an order which is reverse to what was described above.<br>
A preparation example of an organic EL element having a structure in which an anode/a hole injecting layer/a light emitting layer/an electron injecting layer/a cathode are provided in order on a light transmitting substrate shall be described below.<br>
First, a thin film comprising an anode material is formed on a suitable light transmitting substrate<br><br>
by a method such as deposition and sputtering so that a film thickness falls in a range of 1 /zm or less, preferably 10 to 200 nm, whereby an anode is prepared. Next, a hole injecting layer is provided on this anode. The hole injecting layer can be formed, as described above, by a method such as a vacuum deposition method, a spin coating method, a casting method and an LB method, and it is preferably formed by the vacuum deposition method from the viewpoints that the homogeneous film is liable to be obtained and that pinholes are less liable to be produced. When forming the hole injecting layer by the vacuum deposition method, the depositing conditions thereof are varied according to the compounds used (materials for the hole injecting layer) and the crystal structure of the intended hole injecting layer, and in general, they are suitably selected preferably in the ranges of a depositing source temperature of 50 to 450 °C, a vacuum degree of 10"7 to 10"3 torr, a depositing speed of 0.01 to 50 nm/second, a substrate temperature of -50 to 300°C and a film thickness of 5 nm to 5 /im.<br>
Next, a light emitting layer can be formed by making a thin film from*the desired organic light emitting material by a method such as a vacuum<br><br>
deposition method, a spin coating method and a casting method, whereby the light emitting layer is provided on the hole injecting layer, and it is preferably formed by the vacuum deposition method from the viewpoints that the homogeneous film is liable to be obtained and that pinholes are less liable to be produced. When forming the light emitting layer by the vacuum deposition method, the depositing conditions thereof are varied according to the compounds used, and in general, they can be selected from the same condition ranges as in the hole injecting layer.<br>
Next, an electron injecting layer is provided on the above light emitting layer. It is preferably formed by the vacuum deposition method as is the case with the hole injecting layer and the light emitting layer since a homogeneous film has to be obtained. The depositing conditions thereof can be selected from the same condition ranges as in the hole injecting layer and the light emitting layer.<br>
The aromatic amine derivative of the present invention can be codeposited together with the other materials, though varied depending on that it is added to any layer of the light emitting layer and the hole injecting layer, when using the vacuum<br><br>
deposition method. When using the spin coating method, it can be added by mixing with the other materials.<br>
Lastly, a cathode is laminated, whereby an organic EL element can be obtained.<br>
The cathode is constituted from metal, and therefore the deposition method and the sputtering method can be used. However, the vacuum deposition method is preferred in order to protect the organic substance layer of the base from being damaged in making the film.<br>
The above organic EL element is preferably prepared serially from the anode up to the cathode in one vacuuming.<br>
The forming methods of the respective layers in the organic EL element of the present invention shall not specifically be restricted, and the forming methods carried out by the vacuum deposition method and the spin coating method which have so far publicly been known can be used. The organic thin film containing the compound represented by Formula (1) described above which is used for the organic EL element of the present invention can be formed by a publicly known method carried out by a coating metho'd* such as a vacuum deposition method, a molecular beam<br><br>
evaporation method (MBE method), a dipping method using a solution prepared by dissolving the compound in a solvent, a spin coating method, a casting method, a bar coating method and a roll coating method.<br>
The film thicknesses of the respective organic layers in the organic EL element of the present invention shall not specifically be restricted, and in general, if the film thickness is too small, defects such as pinholes are liable to be caused. On the other hand, if it is too large, high voltage has , to be applied, and the efficiency is deteriorated, so that it falls preferably in a range of several nm to 1 Aim.<br>
When applying a direct voltage to the organic EL element, light emission can be observed by applying a voltage of 5 to 40 V setting a polarity of the anode to plus and that of the cathode to minus. An electric current does not flow by applying a voltage with the reverse polarities, and light emission is not caused at all.  Further, when applying an AC voltage, uniform light emission can be observed only when the anode has a polarity of plus and the cathode has a polarity of minus. The waveform of an  alternating current applied may be optional.<br><br>

Example 29 production of organic EL element<br>
A glass substrate (manufactured by Geomatech Co., Ltd.) of 25 mm X 75 mm X l.l mm thickness equipped with an ITO transparent electrode was subjected to supersonic wave washing in isopropyl alcohol for 5 minutes and then to UV ozone washing for 30 minutes.<br>
After washed, the glass substrate equipped with an ITO transparent electrode line was installed in a substrate holder of a vacuum deposition apparatus, and a film of the compound (HI) described above as a hole injecting material was formed in a film thickness of 60 nm on a face of a side at which the transparent electrode line was formed so that it<br><br>
covered the transparent electrode described above. This film (HI) functions as a hole injecting layer.<br>
The following N,N,N',N'-tetra(4-biphenyl)-diaminobiphenylene film (hereinafter referred to as the TBDB film) having a film thickness -of 20 nm was formed on the film (HI). This film functions as a hole transporting layer.<br>
Further, EMI was deposited on the TBDB film to form a film having a film thickness of 40 nm. Simultaneously with it, the following amine compound Dl having a styryl group-was deposited as a light emitting molecule so that a weight ratio of EMI to Dl was 40 : 2.  This film functions as a light emitting layer.<br>
The following Alq film having a film thickness of 10 nm was formed on the above film. This film functions as an electron injecting layer. Then, Li (Li source: manufactured by Saesgetter Co., Ltd.) which was a reducing dopant and Alq were subjected to binary deposition to form an Alq : Li film (film thickness: 10 nm) as an electron injecting layer (cathode) . Metal Al was deposited on the above Alq : Li film to form a metal cathode, whereby an organic EL element was prepared.<br>
The organic EL element thus obtained was<br><br>
measured for a voltage and a light emitting efficiency when an electric current of 1 mA/cm was allowed to flow to determine a half life in light emission at an initial luminance of 1000 nit and a room temperature in DC constant electric current driving, and the results thereof are shown in Table 1. Further, observed was a light emitting state on the light emitting face when sending an electric current after storing at a storing temperature of 1308C for 100 hours, and the results thereof are shown in Table 1.<br><br><br>
Examples 30 to 56 production of organic EL elements<br>
Organic EL elements were prepared in the same manner as in Example 29 to measure a light emitting efficiency and a half life and observe a light emitting state on the light emitting face after storing at a high temperature in the same manners, except that the compounds (H2) to (H28) described above were substituted respectively for the compound (HI). The results thereof are shown in Table 1.<br>
Comparative Examples 1 to 3 production of organic EL elements<br>
Organic EL elements were prepared in the same manner as in Example 29 to measure a light emitting efficiency and a half life and observe a light emitting state on the light emitting face after storing at a high temperature in the same manner, except that the following compounds (H'l) to (H'3) were substituted respectively for the compound (HI). The results thereof are shown in Table 1.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
It can be found from the results shown in Table 1 that the elements using the aromatic amine derivatives of the present invention for the hole injecting material in Examples 29 to 56 were excellent in a storage stability at a high temperature while maintaining a high light emitting efficiency at a low voltage and a long life.. In contrast with this, the organic EL elements prepared in Comparative Examples 1 to 3 were inferior in a hea~ resistance and therefore did not emit an essential blue color, and they heterogeneously emitted light or emitted light which was shifted to a longer wave length due to other light emitting components which were mixed in.<br>
