Method for producing emulsion polymers<br>
Description<br>
The present invention relates to a process for preparing emulsion polymer particles having a core/shell structure and also to their use in paints, paper coatings, foams, and cosmetics.<br>
. Hollow organic particles are a particular variety of core/shell particles composed in dried form of an air-filled cavity surrounded by a hard shell. This construction gives them the particular property of scattering light, which is the reason for their use as a white pigment in paints, paper coatings, and cosmetics, suncreams for example. In such systems they replace part of the inorganic white pigment titanium dioxide, and also boost the effect of the remaining TiO2.<br>
C J. McDonald and M.J. Devon, in Advances in Colloid and Interface Science 2002, 99, 181-213, describe a range of possibilities for producing these hollow particles, including swelling with organic solvents or blowing agents, encapsulation of hydrocarbons, or approaches building on W/OA/V emulsions. The method that is preferred, however, on both environmental and economic grounds, is the osmotic swelling of specific core/shell particles.<br>
EP 226 33 describes this operation fundamentally. In a first step a hydrophilic core composed of 15-70% of a polymerizable acid such as acrylic or methacrylic acid is prepared, and is subsequently ensheathed with a hard, hydrophobic shell composed of &gt;90% of nonionic monomers such as styrene. After the core/shell particle has been completed it is swollen, at a temperature of or above the glass transition temperature of the shell, with ammonia or another volatile base.<br>
EP 915 108, EP 959 176, EP 404 184, US 5,360,827, and WO 00/68304 describe a refinement of the above operation. To facilitate swelling the shell is plasticized by the addition of monomers or organic solvents, and this plasticizer, after swelling has taken place, can be removed from the system simply, by reactive consumption, by adding free-radical initiator, or remains in the system. The use of monomers as plasticizers, however, is tied to certain conditions. Because of their inherent reactivity any premature reaction must be prevented at all costs; in other words, there must be no notable reaction of the monomer. Measures taught in pursuit of this objective include waiting for the free-radical initiator to have been fully consumed by reaction, lowering the swelling temperature, and adding a polymerization inhibitor or a reducing agent.<br>
This approach, however, is hampered by a number of disadvantages. Not only that, as a result of the waiting time, it is necessary to accept prolonged cycle times, in view of the lower swelling temperature necessary in comparison to the conventional operation<br><br>
it is not possible to fully exploit the plasticizing and hence Tg-lowering effect of the monomer. The most serious side effects, however, are those of the use of polymerization inhibitors, since these, naturally, counteract the final depletion of the monomer. In certain circumstances this results in the maximum monomer concentrations being achieved, not at the desired moment of swelling but only later, when a further shell, serving for mechanical stabilization, is applied. This significantly weakens said shell and in a worse-case scenario, as a result of terminal plastic flow, may result in its total destruction.<br>
It was an object of the present invention, therefore, to develop a preparation process for emulsion polymer particles, particularly for hollow organic particles, that avoids the disadvantages of the prior-art processes and which exhibits high monomer concentrations at the moment of swelling.<br>
This object has been achieved in accordance with the invention by means of a process for preparing emulsion polymer particles by preparing an aqueous emulsion comprising<br>
a multistage emulsion polymer comprising<br>
i)       a seed<br>
ii)       a swell seed comprising 0 to 100% by weight of at least one nonionically<br>
ethylenically unsaturated monomer and 0 to 40% by weight of at least one<br>
monoethylenically unsaturated hydrophilic monomer, based in each case on the<br>
total weight of the core stage polymer comprising both the seed and the swell<br>
seed iii)     a first shell comprising 85% to 99.9% by weight of at least one nonionically<br>
ethylenically unsaturated monomer and 0.1% to 15% by weight of at least one<br>
hydrophilic monoethylenically unsaturated monomer (iv)     a second shell comprising 85% to 99.9% by weight of at least one nonionically<br>
ethylenically unsaturated monomer and 0.1% to 15% by weight of at least one<br>
hydrophilic monoethylenically unsaturated monomer v)      at least one plasticizer monomer having a ceiling temperature of less than 181X,<br>
preferably less than 95'C vi)     neutralizing to a pH of at least 7.5 or more, preferably more than 8, the resultant<br>
particles with a base vii)     a third shell comprising 90% to 99.9% by weight of at least one nonionically<br>
ethylenically unsaturated monomer and 0.1% to 10% by weight of at least one<br>
hydrophilic monoethylenically unsaturated monomer viii)    and, if appropriate, further shells comprising at least one nonionically<br>
ethylenically unsaturated monomer and at least one hydrophilic<br>
monoethylenically unsaturated monomer.<br><br>
The invention further provides for the use of the inventively prepared emulsion polymers in paints, paper coatings, foams or cosmetics.<br>
One advantage of the invention is that in stage (iv), when using monomers whose ceiling temperature (Frieder Vieweg &amp; Sohn Verlagsgesellschaft mbH, BraunschweigAA/iesbaden, 1997) is below the swelling temperature or - as an extreme case thereof- monomers which for thermodynamic reasons are unable to form a homopolymer, the disadvantages of the phor art can be gotten around and swelling is â€¢ possible without addition of polymerization inhibitors or reducing agents, even in the presence of residual amounts of initiator.<br>
The described invention relates to a multistage sequential emulsion polymerization. "Sequentiar relates to the implementation of the individual stages, it also being possible for each individual stage to be composed of a plurality of sequential steps.<br>
The term "seed" relates, to an aqueous polymer dispersion which is used at the beginning of the multistage polymerization and is the product of an emulsion polymerization, or may relate to an aqueous polymer dispersion present at the end of one of the polymerization stages for preparing the hollow particle dispersion, with the exception of the last stage.<br>
The seed which is used at the beginning of the potymenzation of the first stage can also be prepared in situ and is composed preferably of acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, esters of acrylic acid and methacrylic acid, or mixtures thereof. Particularty preferred mixtures are those of n-butyl acrylate, methyl methacrylate, and methacrylic acid.<br>

Where the inventively prepared polymers are used for painting, the average final particle size should be 300 to 800 nm; for application in papermaking and in cosmetology, 300 to 2500 nm; and for foams 300 to 800 nm.<br>
In painting, the pigments employed, especially TiO2, may be replaced completely or partly by the polymer dispersion described here. Typically such paints comprise, among other constituents, water, thickener, aqueous sodium hydroxide solution, pigment dispersant, associative thickener, defoamer, biocide, binder, and film-forming assistant.<br>
The hollow particle dispersion can also for similar application in other coatings composed of resinous condensation products comprising phenolates and amino resins comprising urea-formaldehyde and melamine-formaldehyde or other condensates, e.g., water-dispersible alkyds.<br>
Furthermore, it is possible for polymodal heteropolymers of the described invention, having a high fraction of large hollow particles and a smaller fraction of small hollow particles, not only to be used exclusively as a white pigment but also, as a result of the fraction of small hollow particles, to have adhesive properties as well. The use of the pigments in paper coatings leads to an increase in paper gloss. This can be attributed to the shell, which in contradistinction to what is the case with inorganic pigments is deformable under pressure. The printing quality of the paper as well is raised. Replacing inorganic pigments by the organic pigments described herein results in a lowering of the density of the coating and hence to more lightweight paper.<br><br>
In cosmetics the pigments can be used, for example, in sun protection creams for reinforcing the photoprotection. As a result of the extraordinary light scattering properties, the probability of absorption of UV radiation by UV-active substances in the suncream is increased.<br>
The polymers can be prepared by typical polymerization processes of emulsion polymerization. It is preferred to operate in the absence of oxygen, preferably in a stream of nitrogen. For the polymerization method the typical apparatus is used, examples being stirred tanks, stirred tank cascades, autoclaves, tube reactors, and kneading apparatus. The polymerization can be performed in solvents or diluents, such as toluene, o-xylene, p-xylene, cumene, chlorobenzene, ethylbenzene, technical mixtures of alkylaromatics, cyclohexane, technical aliphatics mixtures, acetone, cyclohexanone, tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, glycols and glycol derivatives, polyalkylene glycols and their derivatives, diethyl ether, tert-butyl methyl ether, methyl acetate, isopropanol, ethanol, water or mixtures such as isopropanol/water mixtures, for example.<br>
The polymerization can be conducted at temperatures from 20 to 300Â°C, preferably from 50 to 200Â°C.<br>
The polymerization is preferably conducted in the presence of compounds which form free radicals. These compounds are required in amounts of up to 30%, preferably 0.05% to 15%, more preferably 0.2% to 8% by weight, based on the monomers used in the polymerization. In the case of multicomponent initiator systems (redox initiator systems, for example) the above weight figures are based on the sum total of the components.<br>
Examples of suitable polymerization initiators include peroxides, hydroperoxides, peroxodisulfates, percarbonates, peroxy esters, hydrogen peroxide, and azo compounds. Examples of initiators, .which may be water-soluble or else water-insoluble, are hydrogen peroxide, dibenzoyi peroxide, dicyclohexyl peroxodicarbonate, dilauroyl peroxide, methyl ethyl ketone peroxide, di-tert-butyl peroxide, acetylacetone peroxide, tert-butyl hydroperoxide, cumene hydroperoxide, tert-butyl perneodecanoate, tert-amyl perpivalate, tert-butyl perpivalate, tert-butyl perneohexanoate, tert-butyl per-2-ethylhexanoate, tert-butyl perbenzoate, lithium, sodium, potassium and ammonium peroxodisulfate, azodiisobutyronitrile, 2,2'-azobis(2-amidinopropane) dihydrochloride, 2-(carbamoylazo)isobutyronitrile and 4,4-azobis(4-cyanovaleric acid).<br>
The initiators can be employed alone or in a mixture with one another, examples being mixtures of hydrogen peroxide and sodium peroxodisulfate. For polymerization in an aqueous medium it is preferred to use water-soluble initiators.<br><br>
It is equally possible to use the known redox initiator systenns as polymerization initiators. Such redox initiator systems include at least one peroxide compound in combination with a redox coinitiator, examples being reducing sulfur compounds, such as bisulfites, sulfites, thiosulfates, dithionites and tetrathionates of alkali metals and ammonium compounds. For instance, combinations of peroxodisulfates with alkali metal or ammonium hydrogensulfites can be used, e.g., ammonium peroxodisulfate and ammonium disulfite. The amount of the peroxide compound relative to the redox coinitiator is 30:1 to 0.05:1.<br>
In combination with the initiators or redox initiator systems it is possible in addition to use transition metal catalysts, examples being salts of iron, cobalt, nickel, copper, vanadium, and manganese. Examples of suitable salts include iron(ll) sulfate, cobalt(ll) chloride, nickel(ll) sulfate, and copper(l) chloride. Based on monomers, the reducing transition metal salt is used at a concentration of from 0.1 to 1 000 ppm. For instance, combinations of hydrogen peroxide with iron(ll) salts can be used, such as 0.5% to 30% of hydrogen peroxide and 0.1 to 500 ppm of Mohr's salt.<br>
Polymerization in organic solvents, too, can be carried out using redox coinitiators and/or transition metal catalysts in combination with the abovementioned initiators, examples of such coinitiators and/or catalysts being benzoin, dimethylaniline, ascorbic acid, and organic-solvent-soluble complexes of heavy metals such as copper, cobalt, iron, manganese, nickel, and chromium. The amounts of redox coinitiators or transition metal catalysts normally used here are typically about 0.1 to 1 000 ppm, based on the amounts of monomers used.<br>
If the polymerization of the reaction mixture is started at the lower limit of the suitable temperature range for the polymerization and subsequently completed at a higher temperature then it is advantageous to use at least two different initiators which decompose at different temperatures, so that a sufficient concentration of free radicals is available within each temperature interval.<br>
The initiator can also be added in stages, or the rate of initiator addition can be varied over time.<br>
To prepare polymers having a low average molecular weight it is frequently advantageous to conduct the copolymerization in the presence of regulators. For this purpose it is possible to use typical regulators, such as organic SH-containing compounds, such as 2-mercaptoethanol, 2-mercaptopropanol, mercaptoacetic acid, tert-butyl mercaptan, n-octyl mercaptan, n-dodecyl mercaptan and tert-dodecyl mercaptan, C1 to C4 aldehydes, such as formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, propionaldehyde, hydroxylammonium salts such as hydroxylammonium sulfate, formic acid, sodium bisulfite or hypophosphorous acid or the salts thereof, or isopropanol. The<br><br>
polymerization regulators are generally used in amounts of 0.1% to 20% by weight, based on the monomers. The average molecular weight can also be influenced by the choice of appropriate solvent. For instance, polymerization in the presence of diluents containing benzylic hydrogen atoms, or in the presence of secondary alcohols such as isopropanol, for example, leads to a reduction in the average molecular weight, as a result of chain transfer.<br>
Polymers of low or lower molecular weight are also obtained by varying the temperature and/or the concentration of initiator, and/or the feed rate of the monomers.<br>
In order to prepare higher molecular mass copolymers it is frequently advantageous to operate the polymerization in the presence of crosslinkers. Such crosslinkers are compounds having two or more ethylenically unsaturated groups, such as, for example, diacrylates or dimethacrylates of at least dihydric saturated alcohols, such as ethylene glycol diacrylate, ethylene glycol dimethacrylate, 1,2-propylene glycol diacrylate, 1,2-propylene glycol dimethacrylate, butane-1,4-diol diacrylate, butane-1,4-diol dimethacrylate, hexanediol diacrylate, hexanediol dimethacrylate, neopentyl glycol diacrylate, neopentyl glycol dimethacrylate, 3-methylpentanediol diacrylate and 3-methylpentanediol dimethacrylate. The acrylic and methacrylic esters of alcohols having more than 2 OH groups can also be used as crosslinkers, e.g.. trimethyjol-propane triacrylate or trimethylolpropane trimethacrylate. A further class of crosslinkers are diacrylates or dimethacrylates of polyethylene glycols or polypropylene glycols having molecular weights of 200 to 9 000 in each case. Polyethylene glycols and polypropylene glycols used for preparing the diacrylates or dimethacrylates preferably have a molecular weight of 400 to 2 000 in each case. As well as the homopolymers of ethylene oxide and/or propylene oxide it is also possible to use block copolymers of ethylene oxide and propylene oxide or copolymers of ethylene oxide and propylene oxide containing the ethylene and propylene oxide units in random distribution. The oligomers of ethylene oxide and/or propylene oxide are suitable as well for preparing the crosslinkers, e.g., diethylene glycol diacrylate. diethylene glycol dimethacrylate, triethylene glycol diacrylate, triethylene glycol dimethacrylate, tetraethylene glycol diacrylate and/or tetraethylene glycol dimethacrylate.<br>
Suitable crosslinkers further include vinyl acrylate, vinyl methacrylate, vinyl itaconate, divinyl adipate, butanediol divinyl ether, trimethylolpropane trivinyl ether, allyl acrylate, allyl methacrylate, pentaerythritol triallyl ether, triallylsucrose, pentaallylsucrose, pentaallylsaccharose, methylenebis(meth)acrylamide, divinylethyieneurea, divinylpropyleneurea, divinylbenzene, divinyldioxane, triallylcyanurate, tetraallylsilane, tetravinylsilane, and bis- or polyacryloylsiloxanes (e.g., TegomersÂ® from Th. Goldschmidt AG).<br><br>
The crosslinkers are used preferably in amounts of 0.1% to 30% by weight, based on the monomers to be polymerized, or on the monomers of one stage that are to be polymerized. The crosslinkers can be added in any stage.<br>
it may further be advantageous to stabilize the polymer droplets or polymer particles by means of surface-active auxiliaries. Typically emulsifiers or protective colloids are used for this purpose. Suitable emulsifiers include anionic, nonionic, cationic, and amphoteric emulsifiers. Examples of anionic emulsifiers are alkylbenzenesulfonic acids, sulfonated fatty acids, sulfosuccinates, fatty alcohol sulfates, alkylphenol sulfates, and fatty alcohol ether sulfates. Examples of nonionic emulsifiers that can be used include alkylphenol ethoxylates, primary alcohol ethoxylates, fatty acid ethoxylates, alkanolamide ethoxylates, fatty amine ethoxylates, EO/PO block copolymers, and alkylpolyglucosides. Examples of cationic and amphoteric emulsifiers used include quaternized amine alkoxylates, alkylbetaines, alkylamidobetaines, and sulfobetaines.<br>
Examples of typical protective colloids include cellulose derivatives, polyethylene glycol, polypropylene glycol, copolymers of ethylene glycol and propylene glycol, polyvinyl acetate, polyvinyl alcohol, polyvinyl ethers, starch and starch derivatives, dextran, polyvinylpyrrolidone, polyvinylpyridine, polyethyieneimine, polyvinylimidazole, polyvinylsuccinimtde, polyvinyl-2-methylsuccinimide, polyvinyl-1,3-oxazoiid-2-one, polyvinyl-2-methylimidazoline, and maleic acid or maleic anhydride copolymers, as described in DE 2 501 123, for example.<br>
The emulsifiers or protective colloids are customarily used in concentrations of 0.05% to 20% by weight, based on the monomers.<br>
If polymerization is carried out in aqueous solution or dilution then the monomers can be wholly or partly neutralized with bases prior to or during the polymerization. Examples of suitable bases include alkali metal and alkaline earth metal compounds such as sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, calcium hydroxide, magnesium oxide, sodium carbonate; ammonia; primary, secondary, and tertiary amines, such as ethylamine, propylamine, monoisopropylamine, monobutylamine, hexylamine, ethanolamine, dimethylamine, diethylamine, di-n-propylamine, tributylamine, triethanolamine, dimethoxyethylamine, 2-ethoxyethylamine, 3-ethoxypropylamine, dimethylethanolamine, diisopropanolamine or morpholine.<br>
Neutralizing can also be effected using polybasic amines, such as ethylenediamine, 2-diethylaminoethylamine, 2,3-diaminopropane, 1,2-propylenediamine, dimethylaminopropylamine, neopentanediamine, hexamethylenediamine, 4,9-dioxadodecane-1,12-diamine, polyethyieneimine or polyvinylamine, for example.<br><br>
I<br>
For partial or complete neutralizing of the ethylenically unsaturated carboxylic acids before or during the polymerization it is preferred to use ammonia, triethanolamine, and diethanolamine.<br>
With particular preference the ethylenically unsaturated carboxylic acids are not neutralized prior to and during the polymerization. The polymerization can be conducted continuously or batchwise in accordance with a multiplicity of variants. It is customary to introduce a fraction of the monomers as an initial charge, where appropriate in a suitable diluent or solvent and where appropriate in the presence of an emulsifier, protective colloid or further auxiliaries, to render the atmosphere inert, and to raise the temperature until the desired polymerization temperature is reached. However, the initial charge may also be a suitable diluent alone. The free-radical initiator, further monomers, and other auxiliaries, such as regulators or crosslinkers, for example, each in a diluent, if necessary, are metered in over a defined period of time. The feed times may differ in length. For example, the initiator feed may be run in over a longer time than that chosen for the monomer feed.<br>
If the polymer is prepared in a steam-volatile solvent or solvent mixture, the solvent can be separated off by introducing steam, in order thus to obtain an aqueous solution or dispersion. The polymer can also be separated from the organic diluent by means of a drying operation.<br><br>
Experimental methods<br>
Determination of Glass Transition Temperature<br>
The glass transition temperatures were determined by theoretical calculation using the<br>
Fox equation (John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd., Baffins Lane, Chichester, England, 1997).<br><br>
Measurement of Particle Size<br>
The particle sizes were determined using a Coulter M4+ (Particle Analyzer) or by means of photon correlation spectroscopy, also known as quasielastic light scattering or dynamic light scattering (ISO 13321 standard) using an HPPS (High Performance Particle Sizer) from Malvern, or by means of hydrodynamic fractionation using a PSDA (Particle Size Distribution Analyzer) from Polymer Labs.<br>
Procedure for Measunng the Whiteness<br>
6 g of the color paste described below and 1 g of the approximately 30% dispersion of hollow particles are weighed out into a vessel and the mixture is homogenized without stirred incorporation of air. A film of this mixture is drawn down using a 200 Âµm doctor blade at a rate of 0.9 cm/sec onto a black plastic film (matt finish, Article No. 13.41 EG 870934001, Bernd Schwegmann GmbH &amp; Co. KG, D). The samples are dried at 23'C and a relative humidity of 40-50% for 24 h. Subsequently the whiteness is measured in three different places using a Minolta CM-508i spectrophotometer. The measurement points are marked in order to allow subsequent measurement, using a micrometer screw, of the corresponding thicknesses of the paint film by differential measurement relative to the uncoated plastic film. Following calculation of an average film thickness and also of an average whiteness from the three individual measurements, the resulting whiteness is, finally, standardized to a dry film thickness of 50 Âµm by means of linear extrapolation. The calibration required for this purpose was carried out by measuring the whiteness of a standard hollow particle dispersion in a dry film thickness range of approximately 30-60 Âµm.<br><br>

Whiteness:<br>
Final sample	00069	0049	0054	00056<br>
As is readily apparent from the above table, only sample C1 exhibits ideal behavior and      delivers by far the highest whiteness. C1 shows an ideal profile of residual monomers during the swelling process, i.e., maximum at the moment of ammonia addition without significant drop, and marked reduction following addition of preemulsion 3. In contrast to the ideal behavior just described, methyl methacrylate and styrene as swelling monomers are very quickly broken down (C1C + C2C), and even adding inhibitor is      unable to prevent this (CSC). The inhibitor, instead, has a disastrous effect on the subsequent ongoing polymerization following addition of preemulsion 3. This control of the swelling kinetics is also reflected in the profile of the particle size increase. Only in the case of C1 does the principal expansion occur at the desired moment, i.e., directly after pH adjustment. In the other cases the particle continues to exhibit marked growth even during polymerization of the stabilizing shell, which evidently results in a poorer whiteness.<br>
