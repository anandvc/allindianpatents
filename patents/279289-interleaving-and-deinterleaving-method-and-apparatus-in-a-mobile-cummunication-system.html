				<td>METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR INTERLEAVING DATA IN A<br>
MOBILE COMMUNICATION SYSTEM<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention:<br>
The present invention relates to a method and apparatus for transmitting data in<br>
a next-generation mobile communication system. More particularly, the present<br>
invention relates to a method and apparatus for interleaving data in a mobile<br>
communication system.<br>
2.	Description of the Related Art:<br>
With respect to mobile communication systems, intensive research is being<br>
conducted on Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA) and Single<br>
Carrier - Frequency Division Multiple Access (SC-FDMA) as schemes useful for high-<br>
speed data transmission in a wireless channel.<br>
At present, 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP), the standards group for<br>
asynchronous cellular mobile communications, is studying Long Term Evolution (LTE)<br>
or the Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access (E-UTRA) system, which is the next-<br>
generation mobile communication system, based on the above-stated multiple access<br>
schemes.<br>
A multiple access scheme generally allocates and manages time-frequency<br>
resources on which it will carry data or control information for each user separately so<br>
that they do not overlap each other, i.e., they keep orthogonality, thereby distinguishing<br>
data or control information for each user. For control channels, the multiple access<br>
scheme can additionally allocate code resources, thereby distinguishing control<br>
information for each user.<br>
FIG. 1 is a diagram illustrating time-frequency resource and subframe structure<br>
for transmitting data or control information on an uplink in a conventional 3GPP LTE<br>
system. In FIG. 1, the horizontal axis represents a time domain and the vertical axis<br>
represents a frequency domain.<br>
Referring to FIG. 1, the minimum transmission unit in the time domain is an<br>
SC-FDMA symbol. Nsymb SC-FDMA symbols 102 constitute one slot 106 and 2 slots<br>
constitute one subframe 100. The number Nsymb of SC-FDMA symbols is variable<br>
according to a length of a Cyclic Prefix (CP) that is added to every SC-FDMA symbol<br>
 <br>
for prevention of inter-symbol interference. For example, Nsymb = 7 for a normal CP, and<br>
NSymb = 6 for an extended CP.<br>
A length of the slot is 0.5 ms and a length of the subframe is 1.0 ms. The<br>
minimum transmission unit in the frequency domain is a subcarrier, and the entire<br>
system transmission band is composed of a total of NBW subcarriers 104. NBw is a value<br>
that is in proportion to the system transmission band. For example, NBW = 600 for the<br>
10-MHz transmission band.<br>
In the time-frequency domain, the basic unit of resources is a Resource Element<br>
(RE) 112, that can be indicated by a subcarrier index k and an SC-FDMA symbol index<br>
1, wherein 1 has a value between 0 114 and Nsymb-1 116. A Resource Block (RB) 108 is<br>
defined by Nsymb consecutive SC-FDMA symbols 102 in the time domain and NRB<br>
consecutive subcarriers 110 in the frequency domain. Therefore, one RB 108 is<br>
composed of Nsymb * NRB RES 112. Resources for data transmission are scheduled in the<br>
time domain by an Evolved Node B (ENB), also known as a Base Station (BS), in units<br>
of 2 consecutive RBs.<br>
FIG. 2 is a diagram illustrating a subframe structure for Nsymb = 7 in a<br>
conventional 3GPP LTE system.<br>
Referring to FIG. 2, a subframe 202, which is a basic transmission unit of the<br>
uplink, has a 1 -ms length, and one subframe is composed of two 0.5-ms slots 204 and<br>
206. The slots 204 and 206 are each composed of a plurality of SC-FDMA symbols<br>
211-224. In an example of FIG. 2, in one subframe 202, data is transmitted in SC-<br>
FDMA symbols indicated by reference numerals 211, 212, 213, 215, 216, 217, 218, 219,<br>
220, 222, 223 and 224, and pilots (also referred to as a Reference Signal (RS)) are<br>
transmitted in SC-FDMA symbols indicated by reference numerals 214 and 221.<br>
Therefore, for one subframe, there are a total of 12 SC-FDMA symbols for data<br>
transmission. The pilot, composed of a predefined sequence, is used for channel<br>
estimation for coherent demodulation at the receiver. The number of SC-FDMA symbols<br>
for control information transmission, the number of SC-FDMA symbols for RS<br>
transmission, and their positions in the subframe are given herein by way of example,<br>
and these are subject to change according to the system operation.<br>
The LTE system employs turbo coding as an error correcting coding or channel<br>
coding method for increasing reception reliability of data. For optimized realization, the<br>
maximum size Z of an input bit stream (hereinafter referred to as 'code block') of a<br>
turbo code may not exceed 6144 bits. Therefore, when the amount of desired<br>
transmission data is greater than 6144 bits, the LTE system segments the desired<br>
 <br>
transmission data into a plurality of code blocks, and then channel-codes the code blocks<br>
individually. It is characterized that a size of the code block is a multiple of 8. The<br>
channel-coded code blocks each undergo rate matching on a code block by code block<br>
basis, so that their sizes are adjusted to be matched with the amount of allocated<br>
resources. There is an additional need for an interleaving operation for making the code<br>
blocks be robust against a burst error on a wireless transmission path, and a modulation<br>
operation for increasing the spectral efficiency. The interleaving operation combines a<br>
plurality of code blocks and processes them, and the modulation operation is performed<br>
on the code blocks individually, thereby preventing the possible case where symbols of<br>
different code blocks constitute one modulation symbol.<br>
However, a definition of the detailed interleaving operation is not given in the<br>
LTE system.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS<br>
The following description with reference to the accompanying drawings is<br>
provided to assist in a comprehensive understanding of exemplary embodiments of the<br>
present invention as defined by the claims and their equivalents. It includes various<br>
specific details to assist in that understanding but these are to be regarded as merely<br>
exemplary. Accordingly, those of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that various<br>
changes and modifications of the embodiments described herein can be made without<br>
departing from the scope and spirit of the invention. In addition, descriptions of well-<br>
known functions and constructions are omitted for clarity and conciseness. Terms used<br>
herein are defined based on functions in the exemplary embodiments of the present<br>
invention and may vary according to users, operators' intention or usual practices.<br>
Therefore, the definition of the terms should be made based on the contents throughout<br>
the specification.<br>
Although a description of exemplary embodiments of the present invention will<br>
be made herein on an assumption that a User Equipment (UE), also known as a Mobile<br>
Station (MS), transmits data on the uplink in a cellular communication system based on<br>
the LTE system, it is noted that the present invention is not limited to a particular<br>
transmission system or a transmission direction (uplink or downlink) of data.<br>
With reference to FIGs. 3 and 4, an operating principle of exemplary<br>
embodiments of the present invention will be described. When a number N of code<br>
blocks are formed due to the large amount of information for desired transmission data,<br>
a method for channel-coding and rate-matching the code blocks individually, and then<br>
mapping the code blocks to the allocated time-frequency resources can be classified into<br>
a frequency-first-mapping method and a time-first-mapping method.<br>
With reference to a data transmission block diagram of FIG. 3, a description<br>
will now be made of the frequency-first-mapping method.<br>
FIG. 3 illustrates an example where the amount of time-frequency resources<br>
300 that a UE is allocated from an ENB is defined by reference numeral 302 in the<br>
frequency domain and reference numeral 304 in the time domain.<br>
An ENB may allocate the time-frequency resources on a subframe-by-subframe<br>
basis. The frequency-first-mapping method maps symbols in an arbitrary code block to<br>
the allocated time-frequency resources in such a manner that it sequentially changes<br>
frequency-domain indexes with time-domain indexes fixed. When the frequency-domain<br>
indexes are all exhausted in a given time-domain index, the frequency-first-mapping<br>
 <br>
method sequentially increases the time-domain indexes and then preferentially performs<br>
symbol mapping again in the frequency domain.<br>
Referring to FIG. 3, a code block (0) 306 is mapped to the first SC-FDMA<br>
symbol in the subframe 304 with the frequency-first-mapping method, and a code block<br>
(1) 308 is mapped to the second SC-FDMA symbol in the subframe with the frequency-<br>
first-mapping method. Finally, a code block (N-2) 310 is mapped to the second to last<br>
SC-FDMA symbol in the subframe and a code block (N-1) 312 is mapped to the last SC-<br>
FDMA symbol in the subframe with the frequency-first-mapping method.<br>
In the following transmission procedure, the data is transmitted after<br>
undergoing signal processing in a Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) block 314, a<br>
resource element mapper 316, and an Inverse Fast Fourier Transform (IFFT) block 318.<br>
The DFT block 314 reads input data in units of SC-FDMA symbols, and<br>
outputs a frequency-domain signal through DFT signal processing. The resource element<br>
mapper 316 maps a signal received from the DFT block 314 to the frequency-domain<br>
resources allocated from the ENB in the entire system transmission band. An output<br>
signal of the resource element mapper 316 is transformed into a time-domain signal in<br>
the IFFT block 318 through IFFT signal processing, and then converted into a serial<br>
signal by means of a parallel-to-serial (P/S) converter 320. A CP adder (or CP inserter)<br>
322 adds a CP for inter-symbol interference prevention to the serial signal, and then<br>
transmits the CP-added data via a transmit antenna 324.<br>
However, in the foregoing frequency-first-mapping method, when the channel<br>
environment where data is transmitted is subject to an abrupt time-dependent change<br>
within one subframe, a particular code block may be lost as it suffers a poor channel<br>
environment. Channel coding is a technology in which, even though partial data in the<br>
code block is lost, a receiver can receive the code block without error by using an error<br>
correction capability of added redundant information. However, if all or a considerable<br>
part of the code block suffers a loss, the loss may exceed the limit of the error correction<br>
capability, thereby making it impossible to recover from the error. In this case, Hybrid<br>
Automatic Repeat reQuest (HARQ) retransmission occurs, causing an unavoidable<br>
waste of wireless resources.<br>
Next, with reference to a data transmission block diagram of FIG. 4, the time-<br>
first-mapping method will be described.<br>
FIG. 4 illustrates an example in which the amount of time-frequency resources<br>
400 that a UE is allocated from an ENB is defined by reference numeral 402 in the<br>
 <br>
<br>
frequency domain and reference numeral 404 in the time domain. The ENB may allocate<br>
the time-frequency resources on a subframe-by-subframe basis.<br>
The time-first-mapping method maps symbols in an arbitrary code block to the<br>
allocated time-frequency resources in such a manner that it sequentially changes time-<br>
domain indexes with frequency-domain indexes fixed. When the time-domain indexes<br>
are all exhausted in a given frequency-domain index, the time-first-mapping method<br>
sequentially increases the frequency-domain indexes and then preferentially performs<br>
symbol mapping again in the time domain.<br>
Referring to FIG. 4, a code block (0) 406 is mapped to the first subcarrier in the<br>
allocated frequency-domain resources with the time-first-mapping method, and a code<br>
block (1) 408 is mapped to the second subcarrier in the allocated frequency-domain<br>
resources with the time-first-mapping method. Finally, a code block (N-2) 410 is<br>
mapped to the second to last subcarrier in the allocated frequency-domain resources with<br>
the time-first-mapping method. A code block (N-1) 412 is mapped to the last subcarrier<br>
in the allocated frequency-domain resources with the time-first-mapping method. In the<br>
following transmission procedure, the data is transmitted after undergoing signal<br>
processing in a DFT block 414, a resource element mapper 416, and an IFFT block 418.<br>
Since the signal processing procedure after the DFT block 414 is equal to that in FIG. 3,<br>
a description thereof will be omitted herein.<br>
The foregoing time-first-mapping method can noticeably reduce the possibility<br>
that a particular code block may be completely lost as it experiences the poor channel<br>
environment, even though the channel environment in which data is transmitted is<br>
subject to an abrupt time-dependent change within one subframe. That is, even though<br>
the channel environment is very poor for a particular time period within one subframe, it<br>
is restricted below the limit of the error correction capability from the standpoint of an<br>
arbitrary code block, so that the receiver can recover the data without error. Thus, in this<br>
case, N code blocks all suffer the loss within the limit of the error correction capability,<br>
thereby making it possible to recover the data without error. Therefore, the time-first-<br>
mapping method, compared with the frequency-first-mapping method, is preferred to<br>
map N code blocks to the time-frequency resources.<br>
In defining the mapping method, exemplary embodiments of the present<br>
invention consider the modulation scheme being applied to the desired transmission<br>
data, thereby preventing the possible case where symbols of different code blocks<br>
constitute one modulation symbol. That is, in exemplary embodiments of the present<br>
invention, symbols constituting one modulation symbol become symbols in the same<br>
 <br>
<br>
code block. The mapping operation can be equally realized with the interleaving<br>
operation.<br>
A description will now be made of exemplary embodiments of the time-first-<br>
mapping method or interleaving method where a modulation scheme is considered.<br>
First Exemplary Embodiment<br>
A first exemplary embodiment provides a detailed mapping operation or<br>
interleaving operation to which the time-first-mapping method is applied considering a<br>
modulation scheme for N code blocks that underwent channel coding and rate matching.<br>
FIG. 5 is a diagram illustrating an operating principle of a first exemplary<br>
embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 5, first, a rectangular interleaver having an RxC size is<br>
defined. R 502, a size of a row in the interleaver, is determined by a size Nsc_ anoc of<br>
frequency-domain resources allocated from an ENB (R = Nsc_alloc). C 504, a size of a<br>
column in the interleaver, is determined by the number Nsymb of SC-FDMA symbols<br>
constituting one subframe and a modulation order M That is, C = Nsymb x log2M.<br>
Regarding the modulation order M, M = 4 for Quadrature Phase Shift Keying (QPSK),<br>
M = 16 for 16-ary Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (16QAM), and M = 64 for<br>
64QAM, according to the modulation scheme. For N code blocks, a code block (0) 512<br>
is composed of a total of K(0) channel-coded and rate-matched symbols #0 to #K(0)-1, a<br>
code block (1) 514 is composed of a total of K(l) channel-coded and rate-matched<br>
symbols #0 to #K(1)-1, a code block (2) 516 is composed of a total of K(2) channel-<br>
coded and rate-matched symbols #0 to #K(2)-1, a code block (N-2) 518 is composed of a<br>
total of K(N-2) channel-coded and rate-matched symbols #0 to #K(N-2)-l, and a code<br>
block (N-1) 520 is composed of a total of K(N-l) channel-coded and rate-matched<br>
symbols #0 to #K(N-1)-1.<br>
The N code blocks are sequentially mapped in the RxC interleaver in such a<br>
manner that the horizontal area of the interleaver is preferentially filled by the time-first-<br>
mapping method. This is referred to as a row-by-row mapping scheme. If an intersection<br>
between an rth position of the vertical area and a cth position of the horizontal area in the<br>
interleaver is expressed as (r, c), the mapping operation starts from a position (0, 0). For<br>
example, the first exemplary embodiment maps the first symbol of the code block (0)<br>
512 to the position (0, 0) of the interleaver, maps the second symbol to a position (0, 1)<br>
of the interleaver, and performs symbol mapping to the last position (0, C-1) of the<br>
horizontal area by repeating the operation. Thereafter, the next symbol is mapped to a<br>
position (1, 0), which is an intersection between a position increased by one in the<br>
 <br>
<br>
vertical area of the interleaver and the first position of the horizontal area, and maps the<br>
last symbol to a position (1, C-1) of the interleaver by repeating the operation. The<br>
operation of disposing symbols of the code block in the interleaver is also referred to as<br>
a write operation 506. The first symbol of the code block (1) 514 is mapped to a position<br>
(2, 0) which is the next position of the position (1, C-1) where the last symbol of the<br>
code block (0) is disposed, maps the second symbol to a position (2, 1) of the<br>
interleaver, and maps the last symbol to a position (3, 3) by repeating the operation. By<br>
repeating the above process, the first symbol of the last code block (N-1) 520 is mapped<br>
to a position (R-2, 2) which is the next position of the position (R-2, 1) where the last<br>
symbol of the code block (N-2) is disposed, maps the second symbol to a position (R-2,<br>
3) of the interleaver, and maps the last symbol to a position (R-1, C-1) by repeating the<br>
operation.<br>
After the N code blocks are all disposed in the interleaver, inter-column<br>
permutation 522 (an operation of permuting columns of the interleaver) is performed,<br>
thereby ensuring robustness against a possible time-domain burst error.<br>
When reading the code blocks that underwent inter-column permutation after<br>
being mapped in the interleaver, modulation groups 510 are generated by grouping<br>
adjacent columns in units of log2M taking the modulation scheme into account, and then<br>
column-by-column reading is performed for sequentially reading the modulation groups<br>
from the vertical area. The reading operation 508 starts from the position (0, 0) of the<br>
interleaver. The operation of reading symbols of code blocks from the interleaver is also<br>
referred to as a read operation.<br>
FIG. 5 illustrates an example where a QPSK modulation scheme is applied, and<br>
in this example, adjacent columns constitute modulation groups in units of log2M = 2<br>
from the QPSK modulation order M=4. The first modulation group read from the<br>
interleaver is composed of symbols disposed in the positions (0, 0) and (0, I) of the<br>
interleaver, and the second modulation group is composed of symbols disposed in the<br>
positions (1,0) and (1, 1), a vertical-area index that is increased by one from that of the<br>
first modulation group. Similarly, the last modulation group read from the interleaver is<br>
composed of symbols disposed in the positions (R-1, C-2) and (R-1, C-1).<br>
FIG. 6 is a diagram illustrating an interleaving procedure in a transmitter<br>
according to the first exemplary embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 6, the transmitter determines horizontal and vertical sizes of<br>
the interleaver in step 602. The transmitter determines the horizontal size as C = Nsymb x<br>
log2M taking into account the number of SC-FDMA symbols constituting one subframe<br>
 <br>
<br>
and a modulation scheme, and determines the vertical size R as a size Nsc_alloc of the<br>
frequency-domain resources allocated from an ENB. In step 604, the transmitter<br>
sequentially writes coded symbols in each of code blocks in the size-determined<br>
interleaver on a row-by-row basis. After completing the writing operation on all code<br>
blocks, the transmitter performs an inter-column permutation operation on the written<br>
coded symbols in step 606. The inter-column permutation operation is defined such that<br>
adjacent columns are spaced as far as possible from each other. However, the transmitter<br>
performs a single-column permutation operation on the columns constituting one<br>
modulation group, thereby preventing the possible case where symbols from different<br>
code blocks constitute one modulation symbol in the later step.<br>
In step 608, the transmitter generates modulation groups by selecting log2M<br>
coded symbols that are adjacent to each other along the columns in the same code block<br>
in step 608, and sequentially reads the modulation groups on a column-by-column basis<br>
in step 610, thereby completing the interleaving operation.<br>
FIG. 7 is a diagram illustrating a deinterleaving procedure in a receiver<br>
according to the first exemplary embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 7, the receiver determines horizontal and vertical sizes of a<br>
deinterleaver in step 702. The receiver determines the horizontal size as C = Nsymb x<br>
log2M taking into account the number of SC-FDMA symbols constituting one subframe<br>
and a modulation scheme, and determines the vertical size R as a size Nsc_alloc of the<br>
frequency-domain resources that an ENB allocates. In step 704, the receiver generates<br>
modulation groups by grouping log2M coded symbols constituting one modulation<br>
symbol on a row-by-row basis, for a received signal. In step 706, the receiver<br>
sequentially writes the modulation groups in the size-determined deinterleaver on a<br>
column-by-column basis. In step 708, the receiver performs on the written coded<br>
symbols an inter-column inverse permutation operation corresponding to an inverse<br>
operation of the inter-column permutation operation used in the interleaving procedure.<br>
Next, in step 710, the receiver sequentially reads the coded symbols on a row-by-row<br>
basis, thereby completing the deinterleaving operation.<br>
FIGs. 8A and 8B illustrate a data transmission apparatus to which the first and a<br>
second exemplary embodiments of the present invention are applied.<br>
Referring to FIG. 8A, data generated by a data generator 802, when a size of the<br>
data information is greater than a defined number of bits, is segmented into a plurality of<br>
code blocks in a code block segmentor 804, and the code blocks are channel-coded by<br>
means of an encoder 806. The channel-coded code blocks are size-adjusted to be suitable<br>
 <br>
<br>
to a size of the allocated time-frequency resources in a rate matching block 808, and then<br>
input to an interleaver 810. The interleaver 810, as described above, sequentially writes<br>
the input code blocks on a row-by-row basis by the time-first-mapping scheme, performs<br>
an inter-column permutation operation thereon, and then sequentially reads modulation<br>
groups formed in the same code block on a column-by-column basis. A scrambler 812<br>
performs a permutation operation on the signal received from the interleaver 810 in units<br>
of modulation groups, for inter-user randomization, and a modulation mapper 814<br>
performs a modulation operation on the input signal. The modulated signal is converted<br>
into a parallel signal in a serial-to-parallel (S/P) converter 818 of FIG. 8B, that outputs<br>
the parallel signal to a DFT block 820. The DFT block 820 reads the input data in units<br>
of SC-FDMA symbols, and outputs it as a frequency-domain signal through DFT signal<br>
processing. A resource element mapper 822 maps the signal received from the DFT<br>
block 820 to the frequency-domain resources allocated from an ENB in the entire system<br>
transmission band. An output signal of the resource element mapper 822 is transformed<br>
into a time-domain signal in an IFFT block 824 through IFFT signal processing, and is<br>
then converted into a serial signal by means of a P/S converter 826. A CP adder 828<br>
adds a CP for inter-symbol interference prevention to the serial signal, and then<br>
transmits the CP-added data via a transmit antenna 830.<br>
FIG. 9 is a diagram illustrating an internal structure of the interleaver, according<br>
to the first and second exemplary embodiments of the present invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 9, the interleaver includes an interleaver controller 904, a<br>
writer 906, an interleaver memory 908, and a reader 910. The interleaver controller 904<br>
acquires a size of time-frequency resources for data transmission and a modulation<br>
scheme from scheduling allocation information 912, and determines a size of the<br>
interleaver memory 908 depending on the acquired information. The writer 906<br>
sequentially writes a signal stream 902 being input to the interleaver in the interleaver<br>
memory 908 on a row-by-row basis by the time-first-mapping scheme. The reader 910<br>
performs inter-column permutation on the signal stream written in the interleaver<br>
memory 908, sequentially reads generated modulation groups on a column-by-column<br>
basis and provides an output 914. The interleaver controller 904 provides the writer 906<br>
with information such as size and writing order of each code block, and a size of the<br>
interleaver memory 908, to control an operation of the writer 906, and provides the<br>
reader 910 with information such as a definition of an inter-column permutation<br>
operation, a modulation group generation method, a size of the interleaver memory 908,<br>
and reading order, to control an operation of the reader 910.<br>
 <br>
<br>
FlGs. 10A and 10B illustrate a data reception apparatus to which the first and<br>
second exemplary embodiments of the present invention are applied.<br>
Referring to FIG. 10A, a signal received via an antenna 1002 is subject to CP<br>
removal by means of a CP remover 1004, and the CP-removed signal is converted into a<br>
parallel signal by an S/P converter 1006, and then input to a Fast Fourier Transform<br>
(FFT) block 1008. The FFT block 1008 transforms the input signal into a frequency-<br>
domain signal by FFT transforming. A resource element demapper 1010 extracts a<br>
frequency-domain signal to which desired data is mapped, from the frequency-domain<br>
signal, and applies the extracted signal to an Inverse Discrete Fourier Transform (IDFT)<br>
block 1012. The signal input to the IDFT block 1012 is transformed into a time-domain<br>
signal by IDFT signal processing, and then converted into a serial signal by means of a<br>
P/S converter 1014. The serial signal is demodulated by a modulation demapper 1018 of<br>
FIG. 10B, and a descrambler 1020 performs descrambling on the demodulated signal<br>
using an inverse operation of the scrambling operation used in a transmitter, and then<br>
outputs the descrambled signal to a deinterleaver 1022. A detailed structure of an<br>
exemplary deinterleaver 1022 is illustrated in FIG. 9. The deinterleaver 1022, as<br>
described above, generates modulation groups on a row-by-row basis using the input<br>
signal stream according to a modulation scheme of the transmitter, and then sequentially<br>
writes the modulation groups column by column. Thereafter, the deinterleaver 1022<br>
performs an inter-column inverse permutation operation thereon and sequentially reads<br>
coded symbols row by row. The output signal is input to a rate dematching block 1024<br>
for each code block, in which its size is adjusted to the original code block size. The<br>
rate-dematched signal is decoded by a decoder 1026, and then concatenated to one data<br>
stream by a code block concatenator 1028, thereby achieving data acquisition of the<br>
information 1030.<br>
Meanwhile, it is also possible to obtain a similar effect as that of the foregoing<br>
operation by defining an interleaver given by rotating, by 90°, the RxC rectangular<br>
interleaver and deinterleaver defined in the first exemplary embodiment. In this case, a<br>
horizontal size of the interleaver and deinterleaver is determined as a size Nsc_alloc of the<br>
frequency-domain resources allocated from the ENB, and a vertical size is determined as<br>
NSymb x log2M from the number Nsymb of SC-FDMA symbols constituting one subframe<br>
and a modulation order M. Therefore, the foregoing operations such as row-by-row<br>
writing, a modulation group generation method, an inter-column permutation operation,<br>
and column-by-column reading, should be changed according to a definition of<br>
horizontal/vertical axes of the newly defined interleaver and deinterleaver.<br>
 <br>
<br>
Second Exemplary Embodiment<br>
A second exemplary embodiment provides another detailed mapping operation<br>
or interleaving operation to which the time-first-mapping method is applied considering<br>
a modulation scheme for N code blocks that underwent channel coding and rate<br>
matching.<br>
With reference to FIG. 11, a detailed operation of the second exemplary<br>
embodiment will be described below.<br>
First, a rectangular interleaver having an RxC size is defined. R 1102, a size of<br>
a row in the interleaver, is determined by a size Nsc_alloc of frequency-domain resources<br>
allocated from an ENB and a modulation order M. That is, R = Nsc_alloc x log2M.<br>
Regarding the modulation order M, M = 4 for QPSK, M = 16 for 16QAM, and M = 64<br>
for 64QAM, according to the modulation scheme. C 1104, a size of a column in the<br>
interleaver, is determined by the number Nsymb of SC-FDMA symbols constituting one<br>
subframe. For N code blocks, a code block (0) 1112 is composed of a total of K(0)<br>
channel-coded and rate-matched symbols #0 to #K(0)-1, a code block (1) 1114 is<br>
composed of a total of K(1) channel-coded and rate-matched symbols #0 to #K(1)-1, a<br>
code block (2) 1116 is composed of a total of K(2) channel-coded and rate-matched<br>
symbols #0 to #K(2)-1, a code block (N-2) 1118 is composed of a total of K(N-2)<br>
channel-coded and rate-matched symbols #0 to #K(N-2)-l, and a code block (N-1) 1120<br>
is composed of a total of K(N-l) channel-coded and rate-matched symbols #0 to #K(N-<br>
1)-1.<br>
In the second exemplary embodiment, modulation groups 1110 are generated in<br>
the vertical direction so that adjacent rows constitute one modulation symbol by<br>
grouping symbols in each code block in units of log2M taking the modulation scheme<br>
into account, and then row-by-row mapping is performed for sequentially mapping the<br>
modulation groups in a horizontal area. The reading operation 1108 starts from the<br>
position (0, 0) of the interleaver and the mapping operation starts from a position (0, 0)<br>
of the interleaver.<br>
FIG. 11 illustrates an example where a QPSK modulation scheme is applied,<br>
and in this example, adjacent rows constitute modulation groups in units of log2M = 2<br>
from the QPSK modulation order M=4. The first modulation group being mapped in the<br>
RxC interleaver is disposed in positions (0, 0) and (1, 0) of the interleaver, and the<br>
second modulation group is disposed in positions (0, 1) and (1, 1), a horizontal-area<br>
index of which is increased by one from that of the first modulation group. Similarly, the<br>
 <br>
<br>
last modulation group being mapped in the interleaver is disposed in positions (R-2, C-1)<br>
and (R-1, C-1). The operation of disposing is also referred to as a write operation 1106.<br>
After the N code blocks are all disposed in the interleaver, inter-column<br>
permutation 1122 (an operation of permuting columns of the interleaver) is performed,<br>
ensuring robustness against a possible time-domain burst error.<br>
When reading the code blocks that underwent inter-column permutation after<br>
being mapped in the interleaver, column-by-column sequential reading is performed.<br>
The reading operation starts from the position (0, 0) of the interleaver. The first symbol<br>
being read from the interleaver is a symbol disposed in the position (0, 0) of the<br>
interleaver, the second symbol being read from the interleaver is a symbol disposed in<br>
the position (1, 0), and the third symbol being read from the interleaver is a symbol<br>
disposed in the position (2, 0). In this manner, the last symbol being read from the<br>
interleaver is a symbol disposed in the position (R-1, C-1).<br>
FIG. 12 is a diagram illustrating an interleaving procedure in a transmitter<br>
according to the second exemplary embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 12, the transmitter determines horizontal and vertical sizes of<br>
an interleaver in step 1202. The transmitter determines the horizontal size as C = Nsymb<br>
taking into account the number of SC-FDMA symbols constituting one subframe, and<br>
determines the vertical size R as R = Nsc_alloc x log2M from the size Nsc_alloc of the<br>
frequency-domain resources allocated from an ENB, and a modulation order M. In step<br>
1204, the transmitter selects log2M adjacent coded symbols in the same code block and<br>
generates modulation groups in the vertical direction so that adjacent rows constitute one<br>
modulation symbol. In step 1206, the transmitter sequentially writes the modulation<br>
groups in the horizontal area on a row-by-row basis. After completing the writing<br>
operation on all code blocks, the transmitter performs an inter-column permutation<br>
operation on the written coded symbols in step 1208. The inter-column permutation<br>
operation is defined such that adjacent columns are spaced as far as possible from each<br>
other. In step 1210, the transmitter sequentially reads the symbols mapped in the<br>
interleaver on a column-by-column basis, thereby completing the interleaving operation.<br>
FIG. 13 is a diagram illustrating a deinterleaving procedure in a receiver<br>
according to the second exemplary embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 13, the receiver determines horizontal and vertical sizes of a<br>
deinterleaver in step 1302. The receiver determines the horizontal size as C = Nsymb<br>
taking into account the number of SC-FDMA symbols constituting one subframe, and<br>
determines the vertical size R as R = Nsc_alloc x log2M from the size Nsc_alloc of the<br>
 <br>
<br>
frequency-domain resources allocated from an ENB, and a modulation order M. In step<br>
1304, the receiver sequentially writes input symbols in the deinterleaver on a column-<br>
by-column basis. In step 1306, the receiver performs on the written coded symbols an<br>
inter-column inverse permutation operation corresponding to an inverse operation of the<br>
inter-column permutation operation performed in the interleaving procedure. Next, in<br>
step 1308, the receiver generates modulation groups by grouping log2M symbols in<br>
adjacent rows taking the modulation scheme into account. In step 1310, the receiver<br>
sequentially reads the modulation groups row by row, thereby completing the<br>
deinterleaving operation.<br>
Since a data transmission apparatus, an interleaver's internal apparatus, and a<br>
data reception apparatus, to which the second exemplary embodiment is applied, are<br>
similar to those in the first exemplary embodiment, a description thereof will be omitted<br>
for conciseness. However, the detailed interleaving/deinterleaving operation thereof<br>
follows the description of the second exemplary embodiment.<br>
It is also possible to obtain a similar effect as that of the foregoing operation by<br>
defining an interleaver given by rotating, by 90°, the RxC rectangular interleaver and<br>
deinterleaver defined in the second exemplary embodiment. In this case, a horizontal<br>
size of the interleaver and deinterleaver is determined as Nsc_alloc x log2M from the size<br>
Nsc_alloc of the frequency-domain resources allocated from the ENB and the modulation<br>
order M, and the vertical size is determined as the number Nsymb of SC-FDMA symbols<br>
constituting one subframe. Therefore, the foregoing operations such as row-by-row<br>
writing, a modulation group generation method, an inter-column permutation operation,<br>
and column-by-column reading, should be changed according to a definition of<br>
horizontal/vertical axes of the newly defined interleaver and deinterleaver.<br>
Third Exemplary Embodiment<br>
A third exemplary embodiment provides a detailed mapping operation or<br>
interleaving operation to which the time-first-mapping method is applied for N<br>
modulated code blocks.<br>
While the first exemplary embodiment and second exemplary embodiment<br>
provide an operation to which the time-first-mapping method is applied for N channel-<br>
coded and rate-matched code blocks taking the modulation scheme into account, the<br>
third exemplary embodiment provides an operation to which the time-first-mapping<br>
method is applied for N code blocks that underwent modulation after channel coding and<br>
rate matching.<br>
 <br>
<br>
With reference to FIG. 14, a detailed operation of the third exemplary<br>
embodiment will be described below.<br>
Referring to FIG. 14, first, a rectangular interleaver having an RxC size is<br>
defined. R 1402, a size of a row in the interleaver, is determined by the size Nsc_alloc of<br>
the frequency-domain resources allocated from an ENB. C 1404, a size of a column in<br>
the interleaver, is determined by the number Nsymb of SC-FDMA symbols constituting<br>
one subframe. For N code blocks, a code block (0) 1410 is composed of a total of K(0)<br>
channel-coded/rate-matched/modulated symbols #0 to #K(0)-1, a code block (1) 1412 is<br>
composed of a total of K(l) channel-coded/rate-matched/modulated symbols #0 to<br>
#K(1)-1, a code block (2) 1414 is composed of a total of K(2) channel-coded/rate-<br>
matched/modulated symbols #0 to #K(2)-1, a code block (N-2) 1416 is composed of a<br>
total of K(N-2) channel-coded/rate-matched/modulated symbols #0 to #K(N-2)-l, a code<br>
block (N-1) 1418 is composed of a total of K(N-1) channel-coded/rate-<br>
matched/modulated symbols #0 to #K(N-1)-1.<br>
Row-by-row mapping is performed for sequentially mapping symbols in each<br>
code block in a horizontal area of the interleaver. The mapping operation starts from a<br>
position (0, 0) of the interleaver. The first symbol being mapped in the RxC interleaver<br>
is disposed in the position (0, 0) of the interleaver, and the second symbol is disposed in<br>
the position (0, 1), a horizontal-area index of which is increased by one from that of the<br>
first symbol. Similarly, the last symbol being mapped in the interleaver is disposed in the<br>
position (R-1, C-1). The operation of disposing is also referred to as a write operation<br>
1406.<br>
After the N code blocks are disposed in the interleaver, inter-column<br>
permutation 1420 (an operation of permuting columns of the interleaver) is performed,<br>
thereby ensuring robustness against a possible time-domain burst error.<br>
When reading the code blocks that underwent inter-column permutation after<br>
being mapped in the interleaver, column-by-column sequential reading is performed.<br>
The reading operation 1408 starts from the position (0, 0) of the interleaver. The first<br>
symbol being read from the interleaver is a symbol disposed in the position (0, 0) of the<br>
interleaver, the second symbol being read from the interleaver is a symbol disposed in<br>
the position (1,0), the third symbol being read from the interleaver is a symbol disposed<br>
in the position (2, 0), and in this manner, the last symbol being read from the interleaver<br>
is a symbol disposed in the position (R-l, C-l).<br>
FIG. 15 is a diagram illustrating an interleaving procedure in a transmitter<br>
according to the third exemplary embodiment of the present invention.<br>
 <br>
<br>
Referring to FIG. 15, the transmitter determines horizontal and vertical sizes of<br>
an interleaver in step 1502. The transmitter determines the horizontal size as C = Nsymb<br>
taking into account the number of SC-FDMA symbols constituting one subframe, and<br>
determines the vertical size R as the size Nsc_alloc of the frequency-domain resources<br>
allocated from an ENB. In step 1504, the transmitter sequentially writes symbols in code<br>
blocks in the horizontal area on a row-by-row basis. After completing the writing<br>
operation on all the code blocks, the transmitter performs an inter-column permutation<br>
operation on the written symbols in step 1506. The inter-column permutation operation<br>
is defined such that adjacent columns are spaced as far as possible from each other. In<br>
step 1508, the transmitter sequentially reads the symbols mapped in the interleaver on a<br>
column-by-column basis, thereby completing the interleaving operation.<br>
FIG. 16 is a diagram illustrating a deinterleaving procedure in a receiver<br>
according to the third exemplary embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 16, the receiver determines horizontal and vertical sizes of a<br>
deinterleaver in step 1602. The receiver determines the horizontal size as C = Nsymb<br>
taking into account the number of SC-FDMA symbols constituting one subframe, and<br>
determines the vertical size R as the size Nsc_alloc of the frequency-domain resources<br>
allocated from an ENB. In step 1604, the receiver sequentially writes input modulation<br>
symbols in the deinterleaver on a column-by-column basis. In step 1606, the receiver<br>
performs on the written coded symbols an inter-column inverse permutation operation<br>
corresponding to an inverse operation of the inter-column permutation operation<br>
performed in the interleaving procedure. Next, in step 1608, the receiver sequentially<br>
reads symbols in the deinterleaver on a row-by-row basis, thereby completing the<br>
deinterleaving operation.<br>
FIGs. 17A and 17B illustrate a data transmission apparatus to which the third<br>
exemplary embodiment of the present invention is applied.<br>
Referring to FIG. 17A, data generated by a data generator 1702, when a size of<br>
the data information is greater than a defined number of bits, is segmented into a<br>
plurality of code blocks in a code block segmentor 1704, and the code blocks are<br>
channel-coded by means of an encoder 1706. The channel-coded code blocks are size-<br>
adjusted to be suitable to a size of the allocated time-frequency resources in a rate<br>
matching block 1708, and a modulation mapper 1710 performs a modulation operation<br>
on the code blocks and outputs the results to an interleaver 1712. The interleaver 1712,<br>
as described above, sequentially writes the input code blocks on a row-by-row basis by<br>
the time-first-mapping scheme, performs an inter-column permutation operation thereon,<br>
 <br>
<br>
and then sequentially reads them on a column-by-column basis. A scrambler 1714<br>
performs a permutation operation on the signal received from the interleaver 1712, for<br>
inter-user randomization. The scrambled signal is converted into a parallel signal in an<br>
S/P converter 1718 of FIG. 17B, and then the parallel signal is output to a DFT block<br>
1720. The DFT block 1720 reads input data in units of SC-FDMA symbols, and outputs<br>
a frequency-domain signal through DFT signal processing. A resource element mapper<br>
1722 maps the signal received from the DFT block 1720 to the frequency-domain<br>
resources allocated from an ENB in the entire system transmission band. An output<br>
signal of the resource element mapper 1722 is transformed into a time-domain signal in<br>
an IFFT block 1724 through IFFT signal processing, and then converted into a serial<br>
signal by means of a P/S converter 1726. A CP adder 1728 adds a CP for inter-symbol<br>
interference prevention to the serial signal, and then transmits the CP-added data via a<br>
transmit antenna 1730.<br>
An internal structure of the interleaver 1712 follows the description of FIG. 9.<br>
However, in the third exemplary embodiment, there is no need to consider the<br>
modulation scheme in the interleaver.<br>
FIGs. 18A and 18B illustrate a data reception apparatus to which the third<br>
exemplary embodiment of the present invention is applied.<br>
Referring to FIG. 18A, a signal received via an antenna 1802 is subject to CP<br>
removal by means of a CP remover 1804, and the CP-removed signal is converted into a<br>
parallel signal by an S/P converter 1806, and then input to an FFT block 1808. The FFT<br>
block 1808 transforms the input signal into a frequency-domain signal by FFT<br>
transforming. A resource element demapper 1810 extracts a frequency-domain signal to<br>
which desired data is mapped, from the frequency-domain signal, and applies the<br>
extracted signal to an IDFT block 1812. The signal input to the IDFT block 1812 is<br>
transformed into a time-domain signal by IDFT signal processing, and then converted<br>
into a serial signal by means of a P/S converter 1814. As for the serial signal, a<br>
descrambler 1818 of FIG. 18B performs on the serial signal an inverse operation of the<br>
scrambling operation used in a transmitter, and then inputs the descrambled signal to a<br>
deinterleaver 1820. The deinterleaver 1820, as described above, sequentially writes the<br>
input signal stream on a column-by-column basis, and then sequentially reads the<br>
symbols on a row-by-row basis after performing an inter-column inverse permutation<br>
operation. A modulation demapper 1822 demodulates the signal received from the<br>
deinterleaver 1820, and outputs the results to a rate dematching block 1824 for each code<br>
block, in which the size is adjusted to the original code block size. The rate-dematched<br>
 <br>
<br>
signal is decoded by a decoder 1826, and then concatenated to one data stream by a code<br>
block concatenator 1828, thereby achieving data acquisition of the information 1830.<br>
Meanwhile, it is also possible to obtain a similar effect as that of the foregoing<br>
operation by defining an interleaver given by rotating, by 90°, the RxC rectangular<br>
interleaver and deinterleaver defined in the second embodiment. In this case, a<br>
horizontal size of the interleaver and deinterleaver is determined as the size Nsc_alloc of<br>
the frequency-domain resource allocated from the ENB, and the vertical size is<br>
determined as the number Nsymb of SC-FDMA symbols constituting one subframe.<br>
Therefore, the foregoing operations such as row-by-row writing, an inter-column<br>
permutation operation, and column-by-column reading, should be changed according to<br>
a definition of horizontal/vertical axes of the newly defined interleaver and<br>
deinterleaver.<br>
As is apparent from the foregoing description, exemplary embodiments of the<br>
present invention define a detailed interleaving operation for desired transmission data in<br>
a mobile communication system, thereby reducing a bit error rate or block error rate for<br>
the data and increasing reception reliability.<br>
While the invention has been shown and described with reference to certain<br>
exemplary embodiments thereof, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that<br>
various changes in form and details may be made therein without departing from the<br>
spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims and their<br>
equivalents.<br>
