&amp;<br>
THE PATENTS RULES, 2003<br>
COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10; rule 13]<br>
"TOOL AND PROCESS FOR PRESS-FITTING WEATHER STRIP"<br>
HONDA GIKEN KOGYO KABUSHIKI KAISHA, a corporation of Japan, having a place of business at 1-1, Minamiaoyama 2-chome, Minato-ku, Tokyo 107-8556, Japan,<br><br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br><br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a tool and a process for press-fitting a weather strip into a flange, etc. of a vehicle's door etc.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
In a vehicle such as an automobile, a weather strip is intervened between a capping part such as a door or sunroof and a body of the vehicle so as to block the gap between the capping part and the body for the purpose of preventing the immersion of rainwater, etc. into the gap, and of blocking the zip. The weather strip possesses a fitting portion and a sealing portion. The fitting portion is pressed-in a flange formed along the side edge of the body, and due to the intervention of the sealing portion between the^cfbor etc. and the body when the door eÂ£&amp;.  is closed, the gap caused therebetween can be blocked.<br>
In conventional, as a process for press-fitting such a type of the weather strip, a process has been usually applied in which an operator holds the weather strip and presses-in the weather strip by his fingers, etc. However, in such a manual operation by the operator, a heavy load should be applied to the operator, for example, possibly resulting in trouble with the operator's finger(s), and lowering the operability.<br><br>
In order to solve such a problem, for example, Japanese Utility Model Laid-open No. 59-116181 discloses a device for providing a weather strip. The device for providing a weather strip disclosed therein possess a copying roller having a circumferential groove, which can be engaged with the edge portion of the flange to be fit, placed on the outer circumference, and a presser roller having a circumferential groove, which can be engaged with the sealing portion of the weather strip, placed on the outer circumference. The device has means for keeping an orientation which keep a relative relationship between the copying roller and the presser roller in such a fashion that when the body of the device is moved along the flange to be fit, the copying roller is rolled on and copied the edge of the flange to be fit, and the presser roller applies pressure to the sealing portion so as to engage the fitting portion with the flange to be fit, while guiding the sealing portion.<br>
According to Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 10-109278, a process for fitting a weather strip is disclosed. In the process for fitting a weather stifip disclosed therein is to move the weaij^er strip forward under the condition that an opening of a holding portion of the weather strip is applied on the edge portion of a garnish portion, while rotating the weather strip as the center of the opening.<br>
However, in the device disclosed in Japanese Utility Model Laid-Open No. 59-116181, a pressing force is applied to the sealing portion by means of a motor at the time of press-fitting the fitting portion of the weather strip to the flange. Consequently, a motor<br><br>
having large torque is required as the motor to be used in press-fitting the weather strip. The use of the motor having large torque makes the device large-sized. The large-sized device makes it difficult for the operator to keep the orientation of the device itself in a correct manner, leading to a problem associated with the operability. Furthermore, the device disclosed therein has a problem in terms of flowing-up properties when the flange is curved.<br>
The process disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 10-109278, is to move the weather strip forward under the condition that an opening of a holding portion of the weather strip is applied on the edge portion of a garnish portion, while rotating the weather strip as the center of the opening. Consequently, a large pressure is similarly required in the press-fitting. For this reason, the device becomes a large-size, causing the problems associated therewith.<br>
The present invention is antended to design a small-sized device for press-fitting a weatiier strip so as to enhance the operability of the device at the time of fitting the weather strip and to provide a device for press-fitting a weather strip which has an excellent following-up property even if the weather strip is curved.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION The present invention, which attains the above objects, is a tool for press-fitting a weather strip comprising<br>
-k"<br><br>
a guide member provided on a front portion of a body of the tool, which is supported in contact with an upper portion of ,a portion for fitting the weather strip;<br>
a sealer member, into which a sealing portion of the weather strip is inserted and which possesses a press guide member for pressing the upper surface of the fitting portion of the weather strip, provided on a portion behind said guide member of weather strip;<br>
said tool having a vibrator, which imparts the vibration to said sealer member, stood on said sealer member.<br>
The tool for press-fitting a weather strip according to this aspect, there is provided a vibrator, which imparts the vibration to the sealer member. Because of press-fitting the weather strip to a flange etc. while vibrating the sealer member, the tool for press-fitting a weather strip of the present invention can securely press-fit the weather strip without requiring any large force. What is more, due to the configuration of the press-fitting tool wherÂ»1i&gt;nly the vibrator stands on the sealesmember, the tool per se does not become a large-size, and the press-fitting tool has enhanced operability. Also, even if the flange is curved, the press-fitting tool can exhibit good flowing-up properties.<br>
According to one preferred embodiment of the tool for press-fitting a weather strip, the vibrator is an air hummer.<br>
In this preferred embodiment, an air hummer is used as the vibrator. Consequently, since the simplest member which imparts vibration to the sealer member is used, the press-fitting tool<br>
- 5~<br><br>
can be further small-sized as a whole.<br>
According to another preferred embodiment, an electric hummer may be used as the vibrator. The use of an electric hummer as the vibrator makes it possible to vibrate the sealer member with good response.<br>
Also, when a power source which drives the electric hummer is accommodated within the press-fitting tool, due to the unification of the press-fitting tool with the power source, the operability of the press-fitting tool can be further enhanced.<br>

By utilizing this space S, the operator can hold a front portion of the body 2, which makes it easy to press the balls 13 and 13 possessed by the guide member 3 onto the upper ends of the fitting portion 51 of the weather strip 50. A holding member may be placed for the purpose of placing the operator's hand.<br>
As shown in Figs. 1 and 3, the sealer member 4 possesses a guide roller 21, which is a guide member for pressing, and a holding member 22, which supports the guide roller 21 in a rotation manner. Two rollers 21A and 21A are placed on the guide roller 21 at a prescribed distance, and they are connected to a rotation shaft 21B. A through hole 21a into which a seal portion 52 is pierced is formed between these two rollers 21A and 21A. The lower ends of these rollers 21A and 21A are come into contact with and press the fitting portion 51 of the weather strip 50. Furthermore, the holding member 22 has a roof member i.3fA extending substantially horizontally, and shaft-supporting members 21B and 21B both downwardly extending from both ends of the roof member 22A. A rotation shaft 21B is pierced between the shaft-supporting members 22B and 22B so that the rollers 21A and 21A of the guide roller 21 is supported in a rotatable manner.<br>
As shown in Figs. 1 and 4, the air hummer 5 has a rod 31 accommodated within a case 30, and a hollow cover 32 is fit to a lower end of the rod 31. Within the rod 31 is perforated a hollow<br><br>
portion composed of an air pore perforated from the upper portion<br>
of the center of the shaft and a through hole 34. An air pump<br>
(not shown) is connected to an upper portion of the air pore 33<br>
so as to supply compressed air to the air pore 33. The through<br>
hole 34 is communicated with a hollow portion 32B of the cover<br>
32.    A switching valve 35which switches discharge of the compressed<br>
air is placed between the air pore 33 and the through hole 34.<br>
An air chamber 36 is formed at a middle portion of the through<br>
hole 34, another air passage 37 from the switching valve 35 is<br>
connected to the air chamber 36. At a lower portion of the air<br>
chamber 36 of the through hole 34, a vibration hummer 38 is<br>
accommodated in a vertically movable manner. The vibration hummer<br>
38 possesses an upper tod 38A having a small diameter and a lower<br>
rod 38B also having a small diameter. A flange member 38C having<br>
a diameter larger than those of the upper and lower rods 38A and<br>
38B is placed between the upper and lower rods 38A and 38B. A<br>
lower portion of the lower rod 38B projects from an opening 32A<br>
of the otfver 32.	Jf<br>
A vibration element 39 for vertically vibrating the vibration hummer 38 is accommodated within the through hole 34 , and the lower end of the vibration element 39 is in contact with a base end 38D of the vibration hummer 38. A bush 40 coming into contact with the flange member 38C of the rod 38 is accommodated at a lower portion of the through hole 34 so as to restrict the upper limit of the vibration hummer 38. A cylindrical elastic collar 41 is inserted into the hollow portion 32B of the cover 32 in order to<br>
-7-<br><br>
relax the impact of the vibration from the vibration hummer 38. The elastic collar 41. which can be preferably used, is one having frictional fatigue strength and not generating any force in directions other than the center of the shaft during the compression, including a rubber material such as urethane rubber.<br>
A roof" member 22A of the holding member 22 in the. sealer member 4 is fixed on the lower end of the lower rod 38B of the vibration hummer 38. As described above, the air hummer 5 is configured so that the sealer member 4 is vertically vibrated through the vibration of the vibration hummer 38. At the upper end of the air hummer 5, a grip member 6 to be held by the operator during the operation is provided. A flexible guide 7 is provided between the sealer member 4 and the air hummer 5 in order to prevent the incorporation of dusts etc. into the air hummer 5.<br>
Next, the operation of the press-fitting tool 1 having the configuration as described above will now be described.<br>
When the weather strip 50 is press-fit into the flange F of the vehicle, the operator lightly inserts the weather si'/ip 50 along the flange F in advance. At this state, the weather strip 50 is press-fit utilizing the press-fitting tool 1 according to this embodiment.<br>
Subsequently, when the press-fitting operation is carried out, the press-fitting tool 1 is pressed on the weather strip, having been slightly inserted into the flange F, from an upper side. The balls 13 and 13 of the guide member 3 are come into contact with and supported onto the upper end of the fitting portion<br>
-to-<br><br>
51	of the weather strip 50. At the same time, the sealing member<br>
52	of the weather strip is inserted into the through hole 21a formed between the rollers 21A and 21A in the sealer member 4, and is brought into contact with the upper face of the fitting portion 51 of the weather strip 50. This is ready for press-fitting operation by means of the press-fitting tool 1 according to this embodiment. At this time, the sealer member 4 upwardly moves to ascend the vibration element39, which is in contact with the base end 38D of the vibration hummer 38 in the air hummer 5, to the position of the air chamber 36.<br>
When being ready for the press -fit ting operation, the operator holds the grip member 6 by one hand. The operator puts another hand on the space S secured on an upper portion of the guide member 3, and applies slight pressure P as shown Fig. 1 as an arrow. Subsequently, the operator turns on a switch (not shown) for the air hummer 5 to supply compressed air into the air pore 33. Thereafter, the compressed -air supplied from the air pore 33 is supplied into the air chamberÂ»;36 via the air passage 37 by means of the switching valve 35 to thereby ascend the vibration element 39. Thereafter, the switching valve 35 is switched to supply the compressed air into the through hole 34 to thereby descend the vibration element 39 to apply impact force to the base end 38D of the vibration hummer 38.<br>
This cycle is repeated by the actuation of the switching valve 35 to vibrate the vibration element 39 , the vibration, is in turn, transmitted to the vibration hummer 38 to vibrate the sealer member<br>
-it<br><br>
4 fixed on the lower rod 38B. Once the sealer member 4 vibrates, the vibration is transmitted to the fitting portion 51 of the weather strip 50. The fitting portion 51 of the weather strip 50 can be securely press-fit into the flange F through this vibration. Since the sealing member 52 of the weather strip is inserted into the through hole 21a formed between the rollers 21A and 21A in the sealer member 4, the vibration can be securely imparted to the fitting portion 51 of the weather strip 50 without obstruction of the sealing member 52 of the weather strip during the course of imparting the vibration to the fitting portion 51 of the weather strip 50.<br>
In addition, the operator moves the press-fitting tool 1 of this embodiment forward along the flange F in the direction X shown in Fig. 1 in order to press-fit the weather strip 50 into other portions. When moving the press-fitting tool 1 forward, the operator applies slight downward pressure P to the body 2 while -holding the space S secured on an upper portion of the guide member 3'^VAlso-, the balls 13 and 13 of the gui^e member 3 moves while coming into contact with the upper end of the fitting portion 51 of the weather strip 50. What is more, since the balls 13 and 13 can freely move in any of vertical and horizontal directions, the press-fitting tool 1 can easily and securely moves forward. This makes the operability very ease. Also, since the operator can only moves the guide member 3 along the flange F, the press-fitting operation can easily be carried out, even if the flange F is curved.<br>
- 12--<br><br>
As described above, the air hummer 5 is driven even when the press-fitting tool 1 is moved and the air hummer 5 imparts the vibration to the fitting portion 51 of the weather strip 50 via the sealer member 4. Consequently, since the vibration is continuously imparted to the weather strip 50 in the lengthwise direction, tile weather strip 50 can be securely press-fit into the flange F as a whole.<br>
Next, the second embodiment of the present invention will now be described.<br>
In this embodiment. an electric hummer is used for the vibration of the sealet member and any other configurations are the same as those of the first embodiment. Consequently, only the configuration of the electric hummer will be described and other description will be omitted.<br>
As shown in Figs . 5 and 6, the press-fitting tool 10 according to this embodiment possesses an electric hummer 60 as the vibrator. The electricvfiummer 60 possesses a case 61 and an electric motor 62 provided on an upper portion of the case 61. The electric motor 62 has a rotation shaft 63 which rotates around the vertical axis. The rotation shaft 63 extends to the interior of the case 61, and a first gear 64A of a bev^i gear 64, making up the rotation mechanism of the present invention, is fit to the edge of the rotation shaft 63. A second gear 64B which is engaged with the first gear 64A is fit to an edge of a crankshaft 65. The crankshaft 65 is fit via bearings 66, 66, ~ to the case 61 in a freely rotatable manner.<br>
is -<br><br>
A pin 67 is provided on the surface of the second gear 64B, and one end 68A of a rod 68, making up the crank mechanism of the present invention, is fit to the pin 67. This crank mechanism converts the rotation drive of the bevel gear 64 into linear drive. One end 68A of the rod 68 is in a ring form as shown in Fig. 6. A pin 67 in inserted into one end 66A with a clearance. This clearance rotates one end 68A of the rod 68 relative to the pin 67. Other end 68B of the rod 68 is in a ring form similar to one end 68A of the rod 68, and a drive pin 69 is inserted into other end 68B. The drive pin 69 is fixed onto an upper portion of a drive piston 70, and the sealer member 4 is fit to a lower portion of the drive piston 70.<br>
As shown in Fig. 7, a grip 6 of the press-fitting tool 10<br>
has a power source, e.g., a battery B, accommodated therein. A<br>
storage space (not shoyn) is formed within the grip 6; thus, the<br>
battery B is stored within this storage space and is accommodated<br>
within the grip 6. The battery thus B accommodated supplies<br>
electric power to dri*rÂ§ the electric hummer 60.	*?<br>
By such a configuration, when current is supplied from a power source (not shown) . e.g. , a battery, to the electric motor 62 to rotate the electric motor 62, the rotation force is transmitted to the bevel gear 64. A rod 68 is fit to the second gear 64B of the bevel gear 64, and the rotation drive of the bevel gear 64 is converted into linear drive, which is transmitted to the drive piston 70 as vertical vibration so as to vertically vibrate the sealer member 4. For this reason, by the rotation of the electric<br>
ti,~<br><br>
motor 62, the sealer member 4 can be vertically rotated, via the bevel gear 64 and the rod 68.<br>
In this embodiment, since a power source such as a battery is provided in a detachable manner for use in the electric motor, the power source can be unified with the press-fitting tool, making it possible to further enhance the operability of the press-fitting tool. It is needless to say that when the electric power is consumed, the power source can be exchanged or charged.<br>
Since the electric hummer is used as the vibrator in this embodiment, the press-fitting tool has response better than that in the case of using the air hummer.<br>
INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY<br>
As described above, a weather strip can be securely press-fit without requiring any large force. Whatismore, the press-fitting tool per se does not become a large-size, and the press-fitting tool has enhanced operability. Also, even if the flange is curved, the press-fitting tool can exhibit good flowing-up properties.<br>
Since the simplest member which imparts vibration to the sealer member is used, the press-fitting tool can be further small-sized as a whole.<br>
Also, the use of an electric hummer as the vibrator makes it possible to vibrate the sealer member with good response. Also, when a power source which drives the electric hummer is accommodated within the press-fitting tool, due to the unification of the press-fitting tool with the power source, the operability<br>
-  /5"~<br><br>
of the press-fitting tool can be further enhanced.<br>
While the preferred embodiments of the present invention have been described, the present invention is not restricted to such preferred embodiments. For example, while the guide roller is used as the guide member for pressing, a member which is not rotated can also be used. Further, balls have been fit to the guide member in the preferred embodiments; the fitting of any ball is not essential.<br>
