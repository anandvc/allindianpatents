				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to an MR imaging method and an MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) apparatus, and more particularly to an MR imaging method and an MRI apparatus capable of improving picture quality without increasing the number of times of data collection and restraining artifacts resulting from differences in noise structure between parts differing in the number of times of addition.<br>
In an MR imaging method, it is usual to configure k spaces out of views from the first view through a Vth view which differ in the quantity of phase encoding, repeatedly collect data by Xn times of addition in an nth (n = 1 ~ V) view, and use data An resulting from arithmetic averaging as the data of the nth view for image reconfiguration.<br>
According to the related art, the number of times of addition Xn may be constant all the time as illustrated in Fig. 1, varied linearly to become greater as the absolute value of the quantity of phase encoding decreases as illustrated in Fig. 2, or varied stepwise to become greater as the absolute value of the quantity of phase encoding decreases as illustrated in Fig. 3.<br>
By an MR imaging method according to the related art, whereby the number of times of addition Xn is to be kept constant all the time as shown in Fig. 1, there is a problem that picture quality is little improved relative<br>
to an increase in the overall number of times of data collection because parts where the absolute value of the quantity of phase encoding is large, which little contribute to picture quality, and parts where the absolute value of the quantity of phase encoding is small, which greatly contribute to picture quality, are added the same number of times.<br>
On the other hand, where the number of times of addition is varied to become greater as the absolute value of the quantity of phase encoding decreases as shown in Fig. 2 or Fig. 3, picture quality can be improved without increasing the overall number of times of data collection because parts where the absolute value of the quantity of phase encoding is large, which little contribute to picture quality, are added a fewer number of times and because parts where the absolute value of the quantity of phase encoding is small, which greatly contribute to picture quality, are added a greater number of times.<br>
However, where the variation is linear as shown in Fig. 2, there is a problem that the advantage of improving picture quality without increasing the overall number of times of  data collection is not  sufficient because, although the number of times of addition is maximized in the view where the absolute value of the quantity of phase encoding is "0", the number of times of addition linearly decreases in a part away from that view even by a minimal distance.<br>
On the other hand, where the variation is stepwise as shown in Fig. 3, the advantage of improving picture quality without increasing the overall number of times of<br>
data collection is increased because the number of times of addition is maximized not only in the view where the absolute value of the quantity of phase encoding is "0" but also in neighboring views.<br>
However, since the variation in the number of times of addition is not continuous, there is a problem that differences in noise structure between parts differing in the number of times of addition are apt to invite the emergence of artifacts.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Therefore, an object of the present invention is to provide an MR imaging method and an MRI apparatus capable of improving picture quality without increasing the overall number of times of data collection and restraining artifacts resulting from differences in noise structure between parts differing in the number of times of addition.<br>
In its first aspect, the invention provides an MR imaging method whereby k spaces are configured out of views from the first view, where the quantity of phase encoding takes on the largest negative (or positive) value, through a Vth view, where the quantity of phase encoding takes on the largest positive (or negative) value, and data An resulting from arithmetic averaging as the data of the nth view resulting from repeated collection of data by Xn times of addition in an nth (n = 1 - V) view are used for image reconfiguration, characterized in that the number of times of addition Xn is varied to become<br>
greater as the absolute value of the quantity of phase encoding decreases and to cause all or part of it to follow either a Hamming function or a Hanning function.<br>
The above-described MR imaging method according to the first aspect can improve picture quality without increasing the; overall number of times of data collection because the number of times of addition Xn is varied to become greater as the absolute value of the quantity of phase encoding decreases and to cause all or part of it to follow either a Hamming function or a Hanning function, and accordingly the number of times of addition is increased not only in the view where the absolute value of the quantity of phase encoding is "0" but also in neighboring views. Moreover, since the variation in the number of times of addition is continuous, artifacts resulting from differences in noise structure between parts differing in the number of times of addition can be restrained.<br>
In its second aspect, the invention provides an MR imaging method whereby k spaces are configured out of views from the first view, where the quantity of phase encoding takes on the largest negative (or positive) value, through a Vth view, where the quantity of phase encoding takes on the largest positive (or negative) value, and data An resulting from arithmetic averaging as the data of the nth view resulting from repeated collection of data by Xn times of addition in an nth (n = 1 ~ V) view are used for image reconfiguration, characterized in that, where the reference number of times of addition is N:<br>
(1)	the number of times of addition from the first view<br>
till the (V/8)-th view is (N - N/2);<br>
(2)	the number of times of addition from the (V-V/8+1)-th<br>
view till the Vth view is (N - N/2);<br><br>
(3)	the number of times of addition from the(V/8+1)-th<br>
view till the (V-V/8)-th view is (N + N/2); and<br>
(4)	the number of times of addition from the (V/8 + 1) -th<br>
view till the (V-V/8)-th is a value resulting from the<br>
subtraction of  (N - N/2)  from the earlier calculated<br>
number of  times  of  addition,  multiplication of  the<br>
balance  by either  a Hamming  function or a  Hanning<br>
function,  addition of  (N - N/2)  to the product,  and<br>
discrete processing of the sum.<br>
By the above-described MR imaging method according to the second aspect, the total number of views V is equally divided into eight, and the areas of the two ends of each V/8, where the absolute value of the quantity of phase encoding is the greatest, are reduced in the number of times of addition by 1/2 of the reference number of times N, because their contributions to picture quality is small. On the other hand, the remaining middle 6V/8 areas are increased in the number of times of addition by 1/2 of the reference number of times N, because their contributions to picture quality are great, and further to alleviate the non-continuity of the variations of the number of times of addition, the number of times of addition is varied so as to follow either a Hamming function or a Hanning function. This makes possible improvement of picture quality without increasing the overall number of times of data collection because the<br>
number of times of addition is increased not only in the view where the absolute value of the quantity of phase encoding is "0" but also in neighboring views. Furthermore, as the variation in the number of times of addition is continuous in the part from the (V/8 + 1) -th view till the (V-V/8)-th view, whose contributions to picture quality are great, artifacts resulting from differences in. noise structure between parts differing in the number of times of addition can be restrained.<br>
In its third aspect, the invention provides an MR imaging method whereby k spaces are configured out of views from the first view, where the quantity of phase encoding takes on the largest negative (or positive) value, through a Vth view, where the quantity of phase encoding takes on the largest positive (or negative) value, and data An resulting from arithmetic averaging as the data of the nth view resulting from repeated collection of data by Xn times of addition in an nth (n = 1 ~ V) view are used for image reconfiguration, characterized in that, where the reference number of times of addition is N:<br>
(1)	the number of times of addition from the first view<br>
till the (V/8)-th view is (N - N/2) ;<br>
(2)	the number of times of addition from the (V-V/8+1)-th<br>
view till the Vth view is (N - N/2);<br>
(3)	the number of times of addition from the (V/2-V/8 + D-<br>
th view till the (V2+V/8)-th view is (N + N/2);<br>
(4)	the number of times of addition from the (V/8 + 1) -th<br>
view till the  (V/2-V/8)-th view is a number of times<br>
represented by a straight line linking the (V/8)-th view with the (V/2-V/8+1)-th;<br>
(5)	the number of times of addition from the (V/2+V/8+1)-<br>
th view till the (V-V/8)-th view is a number of times<br>
represented by a straight line linking the (V/2+V/8)-th<br>
view with the (V-V/8+1)-th; and<br>
(6)	the number of times of addition from the(V/8+1)-th<br>
view till the (V-V/8)-th is a value resulting from the<br>
subtraction of  (N - N/2)  from the earlier calculated<br>
number  of  times  of  addition,  multiplication  of  the<br>
balance  by either  a Hamming  function  or  a  Hanning<br>
function,  addition of  (N - N/2)  to the product,  and<br>
discrete processing of the sum.<br>
By the above-described MR imaging method according to the third aspect, the total number of views V is equally divided into eight, and the areas of the two ends of each V/8, where the absolute value of the quantity of phase encoding is the greatest, are reduced in the number of times of addition by 1/2 of the reference number of times N, because their contributions to picture quality is small. On the other hand, the remaining middle 6V/8 areas are increased in the number of times of addition by 1/2 of the reference number of times N, because their contributions to picture quality are great. Then, the areas in which the number of times of addition has been reduced by 1/2 of the reference number of times N and the areas in which the number of times of addition has been increased by 1/2 of the reference number of times N are linked by a straight line to equalize the overall number of times of addition. Further to alleviate the non-<br>
continuity of the variations of the number of times of addition, the number of times of addition in the middle 6V/8 areas is varied so as to follow either a Hamming function or a Hanning function. This makes possible improvement of picture quality without increasing the overall number of times of data collection because the number of times of addition is increased not only in the view where the absolute value of the quantity of phase encoding is "0" but also in neighboring views. Furthermore, as the variation in the number of times of addition is continuous in the part from the (V/8 + 1) -th view till the (V-V/8)-th view, whose contributions to picture quality are great, artifacts resulting from differences in noise structure between parts differing in the number of times of addition can be restrained.<br>
In its fourth aspect, the invention provides an MRI apparatus comprising an RF pulse transmitting means, a slope pulse applying means and an NMR signal receiving means, wherein those means are controlled so as to use for image reconfiguration data An resulting from repeated collection by Xn times of addition and the arithmetic averaging of data in an nth view (n = 1 - V) of k spaces configured out of views from the first view, where the quantity of phase encoding takes on the largest negative (or positive) value, through a Vth view, where the quantity of phase encoding takes on the largest positive (or negative) value, characterized in that it is further provided with a determination means for the number of times of addition to vary the number of times of addition Xn to become greater as the absolute value of the quantity of phase encoding decreases and to cause all or part of it to follow either a Hamming function or a<br>
Hanning function.<br>

In its fifth aspect, the invention provides an MRI apparatus comprising an RF pulse transmitting means, a slope pulse applying means and an NMR signal receiving means, wherein those means are controlled so as to use for image reconfiguration data An resulting from repeated collection by Xn times of addition and the arithmetic averaging of data in an nth view (n = 1 - V) of k spaces configured out of views from the first view, where the quantity of phase encoding takes on the largest negative<br>
(or positive) value, through a Vth view, where the quantity of phase encoding takes on the largest positive<br>
(or negative) value, characterized in that it is further provided with a determination means for the number of times of addition to perform, where the reference number of times of addition is N, addition (N - N/2) times from the first view till the (V/8)-th view; addition (N - N/2) times from the (V-V/8 + 1) -th view till the Vth view; addition (N + N/2) times from the(V/8+1)-th view till the<br>
(V-V/8)-th view; and addition, from the (V/8 + 1)-th view till the (V-V/8)-th, as many times as a value resulting from the subtraction of (N - N/2) from the earlier calculated number of times of addition, multiplication of the balance by either a Hamming function or a Hanning function, addition of (N - N/2) to the product, and discrete processing of the sum.<br>
The above-described MRI apparatus according to the fifth aspect of the invention can appropriately implement the MR imaging method according to the second aspect described above.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention will be described in further detail<br><br>
below with reference to modes of implementing it illustrated in drawings. These modes do not limit the invention, though.<br>
- First Mode of Implementation -<br>
Fig. 4 is a block diagram of an MRI apparatus in the first mode of implementing the invention.<br>
In this MRI apparatus 100, a magnet assembly 1 has within it a void part (hole) into which a sample is to be inserted and, surrounding this void part, there are arranged a static magnetic field coil lp; a gradient magnetic field coil 1g for generating the gradient magnetic filed of a slice axis, a lead axis and a phase axis; a transmission coil 1t for providing an RF pulse for exciting atomic nucleus spins within the sample; and a reception coil 1r for detecting an NMR signal from the sample. These static magnetic field coil lp, gradient magnetic field coil 1g, transmission coil 1t and reception coil Ir are respectively connected to a static1 magnetic field power source 2, a gradient magnetic field drive circuit 3, an RF power amplifier 4 and a preliminary amplifier 5.<br>
Incidentally, a permanent magnet may be used in place of the static magnetic field coil lp.<br>
A sequence memory circuit 6, in accordance with an instruction from a computer 7, operates the gradient magnetic field drive circuit 3 on the basis of a pulse sequence stored in it, generates a gradient magnetic field from the gradient magnetic field coil 1g of the aforementioned magnet assembly 1 and, at the same time,<br><br>
operates a gate modulation circuit 8 to modulate the carrier output signal of an RF oscillator circuit 9 into a pulse-shaped signal of a prescribed timing in a prescribed envelope form, applies it as an RF pulse to the RF pov/er amplifier 4 and, after its power amplification by the RF power amplifier 4, applies it to the transmission coil 1t of the aforementioned magnet assembly 1 to selectively excite a desired slice area.<br>
The preliminary amplifier 5 amplifies the NMR signal from the sample, detected by the reception coil 1r of the magnet assembly 1, and inputs it to a phase detector 10. The phase detector 10, with the carrier output signal of the RF oscillator circuit 9 as its reference signal, phase-detects the NMR signal from the preliminary amplifier 5, and provides it to an A/D converter 11. The A/D converter 11 converts the phase-detected analog signal into a digital signal, and inputs it to the computer 7 .<br>
The computer 7 reads data from the A/D converter 11, carries out an operation to reconfigure an image, and generates an image of a desired slice area. Here, the operation for image reconfiguration is carried out by configuring k spaces out of views from the first view, where the quantity of phase encoding takes on the largest negative value, through a Vth view, where the quantity of phase encoding takes on the largest positive value, repeatedly connecting data in an nth (n = 1, 2, . . . , V) as many times as a number of times of addition Xn, subjecting them to arithmetic averaging, and using the arithmetically averaged data An as the data of the nth view.<br>
The computer 7 further executes processing to determine the number of times of addition shown in Fig. 5 to determine the number of times of addition Xn. It is responsible for over all control, further including reception of information inputted from an operation console 12 .<br>
A display apparatus 13 carries out displaying of the aforementioned image among other things.<br>
Fig. 5 is a flowchart of processing to determination of the number of times of addition pertaining to the present invention. Incidentally, for the convenience of description, it is supposed that V = 256 and the reference number of times of addition N = 50. This reference number of times of addition N can be set by the operator as desired.<br>
At step El, as shown in Fig. 6, the number of times of addition Xn from the first view till a 32nd (32 = V/8) view is set to be 25(= N - N/2).<br>
At step E2, as shown in Fig. 6, the number of times of addition Xn from a 225th (225 = V - V/8 + 1) view till a 256th (256 = V) view is set to be 25 (= N - N/2) .<br>
At step E3, as shown in Fig. 6, the number of times of addition Xn' from a 33rd (33 = V/8 + 1) till a 224th (224 = V - V/8) view is set to be 75 (75 = N + N/2) .<br>
At step E4, as shown in Fig. 7, the balance "50" of the subtraction of "25" (= N - N/2) from the number of times of addition Xn' = 75 from the 33rd (33 = V/8 + 1) view till the 224th (224 = V - V/8) view is multiplied by the following Hamming function:<br>
Wn = 0.54 - 0.46cos{2π(n - V/8)/(3V/4)}<br>
Or it is multiplied by the following Hanning function:<br>
Wn = 0.5(1 - cos{2π(n - V/8)/(3V/4)}<br>
Then, "25" (= N - N/2) is added. Further, the resultant sum is subjected to discrete processing, whose result represents the number of times of addition Xn in the nth view. Thus, where an integral function is denoted by int{}, the number of times of addition Xn of the nth view is calculated by:<br>
Xn = int{[Xn' - (N-N/2)]Wn + (N - N/2)}<br>
The above-described MRI apparatus 100 reduces the number of times of addition Xn in parts where the absolute value of the quantity of phase encoding is large, which little contribute to picture quality, and increases the number of times of addition Xn in parts where the absolute value of the quantity of phase encoding is small, which greatly contribute to picture quality. The number of times of addition Xn is increased not only in the part where the absolute value of the quantity of phase encoding is "0" but also in its vicinities. Therefore, picture quality can be efficiently improved without increasing the overall number of times of data collection. Furthermore, as the variation in the number of times of addition Xn is continuous in the part from the 33rd (33 = V/8 + 1) view till the 224th (224 = V - V/8) view, whose contributions to picture quality are great, artifacts resulting from differences in noise structure between parts differing in the number of times of addition Xn can be restrained.<br>
- Second Mode of Implementation -<br>
Fig. 8 is another flowchart of processing to determine the number of times of addition pertaining to the present invention. Incidentally, for the convenience of description, it is supposed that V = 256 and the reference number of times of addition N = 50.<br>
At step Fl, as shown in Fig. 9, the number of times of addition Xn from the first view till a 32nd (32 = V/8) view is set to be 25(= N - N/2).<br>
At step F2, as shown in Fig. 9, the number of times of addition Xn from a 225th (225 == V - V/8 + 1) view till a 256th (256 = V) view is set to be 25 (= N - N/2).<br>
At step F3, as shown in Fig. 9,	the number of times of<br>
addition Xn' from a 97th (97 =	V/2 - V/8 + 1) till a<br>
160th (160 = V/2 + V/8) view is	set to be 75 (75 = N +<br>
N/2) .<br>
At step F4, as shown in Fig. 9, the number of times of addition Xn' from a 33rd (33 = V/8 + 1) view till a 96th (96 = V/2 - V/8) view is set to be a value represented by a straight line linking the number of times of addition Xn of the 32nd (32 = V/8) view with the 97th (97 = V/2 -V/8 + 1) view.<br>
At step F5, as shown in Fig. 9, the number of times of addition Xn' from a 161st (161 = V/2 + V/8 + 1) view till a 224th (224 =V - V/8) view is set to be a value represented by a straight line linking the number of times of addition Xn' of a 160th (160 = V/2 + V/8) view with the number of times of addition Xn of a 225th (225 = V - V/8 + 1) view.<br>
At step F6, as shown in Fig. 10, the balance "50" of the subtraction of "25" (= N - N/2) from the number of times of addition Xn' = 75 from the 33rd (33 = V/8 + 1) view till the 224th (224 = V - V/8) view is multiplied by the following Hamming function:<br>
Wn = 0.54 - 0.46cos{27π(n - V/8)/(3V/4)}<br>
Or it is multiplied by the following Banning function:<br>
Wn = 0.5(1 - cos{2π(n - V/8)/(3V/4)}<br>
Then, "25" (= N - N/2) is added. Further, the resultant sum is subjected to discrete processing, whose result represents the number of times of addition Xn in the nth view. Thus, where an integral function is denoted by int{}, the number of times of addition Xn of the nth view is calculated by:<br>
Xn = int{[Xn' - (N - N/2)]Wn + (N - N/2)}<br>
In the second mode of implementation described above, too, picture quality can be efficiently improved without increasing the overall number of times of data collection (which is less than in the first: mode of implementation) . Furthermore, artifacts resulting from differences in noise structure between parts differing in the number of times of addition Xn can be restrained.<br>
Many widely different embodiments of the invention may be configured without departing from the spirit and the scope of the present invention. It should be understood that the present invention is not limited to the specific embodiments described in the specification, except as defined in the appended claims.<br><br><br><br>
