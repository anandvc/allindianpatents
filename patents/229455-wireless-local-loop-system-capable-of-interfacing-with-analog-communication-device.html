				<td>[0001]     This application claims the benefit of the Korean Application No. P2001-82737 filed on December 21, 2001, which is hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Field of the Invention<br>
[0002]     The present invention relates to a wireless local loop system, and more particularly,  to  a wireless local  loop system capable  of interfacing with an analog communication device, such as a credit card referencing device, a smart payphone, a security system, a wireless inspection device, and the like. Background of the Related Art<br>
[0003] In general, the wireless local loop (hereafter called as 'WLL') system provides a wireless subscriber line, to connect between a local switching center and home or office, not by wire, but by radio, for providing voice, facsimile, and data communication services.<br>
[0004] The WLL is called RITL (Radio In the Loop), FRA (Fixed Radio Access), FWA (Fixed Wireless Access), or PCS (Fixed Cellular System) in some countries, and a one of fields that draws attention of communication providers, recently. The WLL system has been devised by AT&amp;T Bell Laboratory in early 1970 for a sparsely populated region, such as fishing and agrarian villages, for reducing installation cost.<br>
[0005] However, because securing radio frequencies was not easy, and costs for manufacturing and installation of antennas and radio transmitters/receivers were excessive, the WLL system could not be put into practical use. However, as semiconductor and electronic communication technologies are developed rapidly in 1990s, the problems, such as a frequency efficiency, a radio channel quality, and installation cost per a subscriber, are solved, such that many manufacturers produce economic products, the WLL system starts to draw attention of the communication providers.<br>
[0006] The communication providers pay attention to the WLL system because of the following features of the WLL system.<br>
[0007] First, installation of subscriber line is easier than a current subscriber line network in which the connection from a local switchboard to a subscriber home is made by a line, and a time period required until starting of service is short.<br>
[0008] Second, the WLL system has a merit in view of endurance of service because the WLL system can be used as an emergency subscriber line in case of damage to the current subscriber line network caused by a natural disaster, or the like.<br>
[0009] Third, the WLL system can provide a flexible service for a variety of service requirements, such as FOTS (Plain Old Telephone Service), data service, ISDN, and the like.<br>
[0010] Fourth, installation cost is fixed regardless of distance, to have a little initial investment cost, and collection of the investment cost is fast.<br>
[0011] Fifth, a WLL system network can be expanded quickly according to an increased subscriber communication.<br>
[0012] The WLL having the foregoing features is considered to be the most potent method for construction of a subscriber network quickly by a new telephone service provider, or a new communication service provider, and particularly, paid attention as a fundamental communication system of a developing country that has a POTS.<br>
[0013] In the meantime, though the WLL is similar to a mobile communication network in view that radio channels are used as communication media, the WLL has an advantage in that the WLL has an electronic wave environment better than the electronic wave environment of the mobile communication network because the WLL has no mobility. Besides, the WLL had the following features in comparison to the mobile communication network.<br>
[0014]     Though the environment of the mobile communication network has a wave path loss in a range of 40dB/decade as the environment is a non-line-of-sight environment because of blocking, reflection, and refraction of a straight wave by surrounding buildings as the antenna is located at a place lower than the surrounding buildings, the environment of the WLL has a wave path loss as low as 20dB/decade as the environment is a line-of-sight environment because the antenna is located at a rooftop and a mobility of the antenna is limited, permitting to serve a larger area by using the same power.<br>
[0015] Because the electronic wave environment of the WLL is a stationary communication of a point to point type, the electronic wave environment of the WLL has substantially less fading caused by multiple paths than the electronic wave environment of a mobile communication network that has a point to mobile station type.<br>
[0016]      The   WLL  requires  no   hand-over   as   the   WLL   is  a  stationary  radio communication network.    Therefore, the WLL requires no reserve radio channels for the hand-over that is required for a communication service without discontinuation of a call in the mobile communication network.    These reserve radio channels may be used for general calls permitting to obtain the increased use efficiency of a radio channel and an increased subscriber capacity.    Radio link between a building and a base station can be established for reducing interference to a particular subscriber, and, because there is no change of the radio link unless the subscribers are increased too much or a cell is divided, a design of the WLL is substantially simpler than a mobile communication network.<br>
[0017] Moreover, the stationary radio communication of the WLL permits to use directional antenna on forward/reverse links for reducing an identical channel interference to respective subscribers, that is turn permits to reduce a distance of frequency re-use. The reduction of frequency re-use distance brings about an increased subscriber capacity per a unit<br>
area.<br>
[0018] Basically, the WLL is provided with a telephone set, an NIU (Network Interface Unit) that makes a wireless communication between the telephone set and a local switching center possible, a base station, a base station controller, a base station managing device, and the like, of which functions will be explained.<br>
[0019]     The NIU is an end point of network elements for carrying out functions of transmission/reception of a radio signal, modulation/demodulation of a radio channel, voice compression/restoration, and access to a PSTN terminal.    There may be various forms of terminals depending on applied technologies, such as a form of terminal a RF function is built-in, a form of terminal RF function is provided separately, and a handset form, and the like, and a single line, or multiple line may be provided.<br>
[0020] The base station is located between the NIU and the base station controller, and connected to the NIU by radio, and to the base station controller by wire, for transmission/reception of a radio signal, power control, modulation/demodulation of a channel, protocol transform for signal transmission/reception with the NIU and the base station controller. The base station is provided with an antenna transmitter/receiver, a power amplifier, channel cards, and hardware for interface with the base station controller.<br>
[0021] In making a radio access between the NIUs, the base station has a limitation of a capable cell radius caused by limitations in the electronic wave environment and a radio power, to require the base station controller for effective access to a wireless section and a wire section. The base station controller is located between the local switching center and the base station, for connecting the local switching center and the base station and managing the base station. The base station controller is connected to respective base stations by wire mostly, and for managing radio resources, transcoding, base station managing, and a function<br>
of base station and switchboard match.<br>
[0022] The base station managing device has functions of managing and maintenance of entire equipment of the WLL, such as network system managing, performance managing, data processing, software management, security management, and the like.<br>
[0023] The telephone set and the NIU are the WLL system of the present invention. There are a separate type WLL system and an integrated type WLL system in the foregoing WLL system depending on connection between the telephone set and the NIU.<br>
[0024] That is, the separate type WLL system has a stationary telephone set, and an NIU separated from each other to be connected by wire for purchase of, not the telephone set, but the NIU only, when a subscriber having the stationary telephone set connected to an existing wire network intends to subscribe to the WLL.<br>
[0025] The integrated type WLL system has a telephone set and the NIU integrated as one unit in hardware basis, for convenience of a subscriber who has no stationary telephone set connected to an existing wire network.<br>
[0026] A related art WLL system will be explained. FIG. 1 illustrates a block diagram of a related art WLL system.<br>
[0027] Referring to FIG. 1, the related art WLL system is provided with a RF transmission/reception part 11 for receiving a RF signal from an antenna, with a transmission frequency 824 - 849 MHz and a reception frequency 869-894MHz differed by super heterodyne system, producing an IF (Intermediate Frequency) signal, converting the IF signal into a digital baseband signal through an amplifier and an analog/digital converter, and providing the digital baseband signal to an MSM 12(Mobile System Modem), and converting a digital baseband signal received from the MSM 12 into an analog signal and an intermediate frequency signal, converting the IF signal into a RF band signal intended to transmit, and providing the RF band signal to the base station through the antenna, the MSM 12 for decoding the digital baseband signal from the RF transmission/reception part 11 to produce an information data, coding an information data intended to transmit, converting the coded information data into a digital baseband signal, and providing the digital baseband signal to the RF transmission/reception part 11, a CODEC 13 for coding an analog voice signal from the mic in the handset into a digital voice signal, and providing the digital voice signal to the MSM 12, and decoding a digital voice signal from the MSM 12 into an analog voice signal, adjusting levels of respective voice signals, and providing to the speaker in the handset, the handset 14 connected to the CODEC 13 by a coil line having a speaker for presenting the analog voice signal from the CODEC 13, and a mic for providing a analog voice signal to the CODEC  13, and a RS-232C driver 15 for line connection between an external device (computer) and the WLL system, for carrying out serial communication.<br>
[0028]      The operation of the related art WLL system will be explained.    At first, a reception mode will be explained.<br>
[0029] Though not shown, because a hook detecting part(not shown) detects on/off of the hook switch and provides the status information of the hook switch to the MSM 12, the MSM 12 always checks on/off of the hook switch. Accordingly, when an antenna signal is received from the base station in a state the hook switch is off, a ring signal is provided to a user. The RF transmission/reception part 11 receives the RF signal from the antenna, produces an intermediate frequency IF signal, converts the IF signal into digital baseband signal, and provides the digital baseband signal to the MSM 12.<br>
[0030] The MSM 12 decodes the digital baseband signal from the RF transmission /reception part 11 to produce an information data, and provides the information data to the CODEC 13. The CODEC 13 decodes the digital voice signal from the MSM 12 into an<br>
analog voice signal, adjusts levels of respective voice signals, and presents a voice signal through the speaker in the handset 14.<br>
[0031]     An analog voice signal received through the mic in the handset is coded at the CODEC 13 into a digital voice signal, and provided the digital voice signal to the MSM 12. The MSM 12 receives and codes the digital voice signal, converts the coded digital voice signal into a digital baseband signal, and provides the digital baseband signal to the RF transmission/reception part 11.   The RF transmission/reception part 11 receives the digital baseband signal from the MSM, converts the digital baseband signal into an analog signal and an intermediate frequency signal, and converts the IF signal into a RF band signal intended to transmit, and provides the RF band signal to the base station through the antenna.    Thus, the WLL system can make transmission/reception with the base station.<br>
[0032] In the meantime, if the user intends to setup a call, the user holds up the handset 14 to switch on the hook switch, and dials a telephone number on key pad (not shown) and then a radio channel for the communication is assigned to the WLL system, to make a communication in a method explained before. The WLL system may be connected to personal computer through the RS-232C driver 15 for making digital data transmission/reception.<br>
[0033]      However, the related an WLL system has the following problems. [0034]      Since the related art WLL system has no function for interfacing with analog communication devices, such as a credit card referencing device, a smart payphone, a security system, a wireless inspection device, and a computer with a built in MODEM, regular data transmission/reception to/from those analog communication devices have not been possible.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION [0035]      Accordingly, the present invention is directed to a wireless local loop system<br>
capable of interfacing with an analog communication device that substantially obviates one or more of the problems due to limitations and disadvantages of the related art.<br>

The objectives and other advantages of the invention will be realized and attained by the structure particularly pointed out in the written description and claims hereof as well as the appended drawings.<br>

{0046]      For reference, the class '0' digital data is not a data for fax, but general data. [0047]      The MODEM 16 will be explained in more detail. FIG. 3 illustrates a detailed block diagram of the MODEM in FIG. 2.<br>
[0048] Referring to FIG. 3, the MODEM 16 includes a data modem 21 for converting an analog signal from the analog communication device 18 through the SLIC 17 into a class '0' digital data, or converting a class '0' digital data from the MSM 12 into an analog signal, a memory 22 for temporary storage of the class '0' digital data converted at the data modem 21,<br>
or temporary storage of the class '0' digital data from the MSM 12, a controller 23 for controlling or converting a data to be in conformity with protocol characteristics the analog communication devices   18 depending on types of the  analog communication device, reading/writing a data in memory 22, and controlling signal processing at the data modem 21 for providing/receiving signal to/from the MSM 12 and the SLIC 17, and providing a control signal to the system including a base station for providing interchangeability between the analog communication device 18 and an modem of the other parts to exchange signal with the analog communication device 18 if the analog communication device 18 is the credit card referencing device or the smart payphone, and a DTMF detecting part 24 for detecting a DTMF signal and providing the DTMF signal to the controller 23 so that the controller 23 can determine whether the data is a voice signal or a data signal.   The unexplained reference symbol is analog MUX/DEMUX 25.<br>
[0049]      The operation of the  foregoing wireless  local  loop system capable of interfacing with an analog communication device  18 of the present invention will be explained.    Explanation on using the telephone set 19 will be omitted as it is identical to the related art.    It is precondition that the analog communication device 18 has an analog MODEM.<br>
[0050] In general, the credit card referencing device communicates with a designated telephone having a number to a card company or an entity similar thereto through the MODEM 16 for referencing credit of a card holder, and the smart payphone also transmits a data to a designated switchboard through the MODEM 16 for reporting the present state of the smart payphone to a relevant office. The other analog communication devices also communicate with a designated telephone having numbers to the some places related to reporting the present states. Accordingly, when the analog communication device 18<br>
provides an analog signal to the WLL system, the SLIC 17 transfers the received signal to the MODEM 16.<br>
[0051]     The MODEM 16 is operative as follows.<br>
[0052] The DTMF detecting part 24 detects a DTMF signal from signals of the SLIC 17 and informs the controller 23 of the DTMF signal so that the controller 23 determines whether the received signal is a voice signal or a data signal. When the DTMF detecting part 24 detects the DTMF signal, the controller 23 recognized that the analog communication device 18 inputs a designated telephone number and then controls to setup a call corresponding to the telephone number.<br>
[0053] When the DTMF signal is the same with a particular signal stored in the controller 23, the controller 23 recognizes that the received signal is the data call and then controls the data modem 21 to convert the analog signal from the SLIC 17 into a class '0' digital data, converts the data in conformity with protocol characteristics of the analog communication device 18, and stores the converted data at the memory 22, temporarily.<br>
[0054] When the analog communication device 18 is the credit card referencing device, or the smart payphone, the controller 23 provides the data stored at the memory 22 to the MSM 12, together with the control signal to be transmitted to the system Including the base station for providing interchangeability between the analog communication device 18 and the MODEM 16 of the other parts to transmit/receive signals thereto/therefrom.<br>
[0055] The MSM 12 codes the class '0' digital data received from the controller 23 in the MODEM 23, converts the class '0' digital data into a digital baseband signal, and provides the digital baseband signal to the RF transmission/reception part 11. The RF transmission/reception part 11 converts the digital baseband signal received from the MSM into an analog signal, an intermediate frequency signal, and a RF band signal intended to<br>
transmit, and provides the RF band signal to the base station through the antenna.<br>
[0056]     Opposite to this, in reception, though not shown, since the hook detecting detects off/on of the hook switch, and provides the status information of the hook switch to the MSM 12, the MSM 12 always checks off/on of the hook switch.   Accordingly, when a signal is received at the antenna from the base station in a state the hook switch is switch off, a ring signal is provided to inform to the user.   Then, the RF transmission/reception part 11 receives the RF signal from the antenna, produces the IF signal, converts the IF signal into a digital baseband signal, and provides the digital baseband signal to the MSM 12.<br>
[0057] The MSM 12 decodes the digital baseband signal received from the RF transmission/reception part 11, to produce an information data, and provides the information data to the MODEM 16. The MODEM 16 decodes the class '0' digital data from the MSM 12 into an analog signal, and provides the analog signal to the analog communication device 18 through the SLIC 17. Then, the analog communication device 18 displays the analog signal from the analog communication device 18 through the SLIC 17 on display means to the user to see.<br>
[0058] As has been explained, the wireless local loop system capable of interfacing with an analog communication device has the following advantages.<br>
[0059] First, since the wireless local loop system is capable of interfacing with an analog communication device, a wireless communication with an analog communication device through the wireless local loop system is made possible.<br>
