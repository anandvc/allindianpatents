TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001]<br>
The present invention relates to a novel insecticidal and fungicidal composition exhibiting excellent insecticidal and fungicidal actions for the labor-saving control of crop diseases and insect pests.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
[0002]<br>
The compound represented by the general formula (1) of the present invention is a novel compound having an insecticidal activity.<br>
[0003]<br>
In International Publication No. 2000 / 55120 pamphlet and US Patent No. 6548514, a compound similar to the compound represented by the general formula (1) of the present invention for medical use is described. But activity against insects is never described therein. Furthermore, it is obvious that such compounds are not included in the claims of the present invention.<br>
[0004]<br>
In International Publication No. 2000 / 7980 pamphlet, a compound similar to the compound represented by the general formula (1) of the present invention for medical use is described. But<br><br>
activity against insects is never described therein. Furthermore, it is obvious that such a compound is not included in the claims of the present invention.<br>
[0005]<br>
In US Patent Laid-Open No. 2002-032238, a compound similar to the compound represented by the general formula (1) of the present invention for medical use is described. But activity against insects is never described therein. Furthermore, it is obvious that such a compound is not included in the claims of the present invention.<br>
[0006]<br>
Meanwhile, the compound represented by the general formula (2) is described in International Publication No. 2005 / 21488 pamphlet before the application of the present invention and the compound itself has an insecticidal action. In addition, in International Publication No. 2003 / 008372 pamphlet and International Publication No. 2005 / 042474 pamphlet, it has been described that the compound represented by the general formula (3) or (4) has a control action against rice blast (Pyricularia oryzae)<br>
[0007]<br>
However, these active compounds have an action exhibiting any of an insecticidal effect or a fungicidal effect with the use of a single agent thereof, but cannot control crop diseases and insect pests at the same time.<br>
