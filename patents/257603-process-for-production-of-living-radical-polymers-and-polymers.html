				<td>SPECIFICATION PROCESS FOR PRODUCTION OF LIVING RADICAL POLYMERS AND POLYMERS<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a process for producing living radical polymers and the living radical polymers obtained by the process.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Living radical polymerization is a polymerization process which is adapted for precision control of molecular structures while ensuring convenience and universal usefulness of radical polyme'rization, and is powerful means for preparing novel polymer materials. Georges et al has made a report on a typical example of living radical polymerization using TEMPO (2 , 2,6,6 -tetramethyl-1-piperidinyloxy) as an initiator (publication of JP-A No. 1994-199916) .<br>
This process makes it possible to control molecular weights and molecular weight distributions, but requires a high polymerization temperature of 130°C and is difficult to use for monomers having a thermally unstable functional group.  The process is also unsuited to the control of modification of terminal functional groups of high molecular weight compounds.<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide a process for producing a living radical polymer by polymerizing a vinyl monomer with use of an organotellurium compound represented by the formula (1) and a compound represented by the formula (2), the process making possible precision control of molecular weights and molecular weight distributions (PD=Mw/Mn) under mild conditions, and the polymer.<br><br>

More preferable are dimethyl ditelluride, diethyl ditelluride, di-n-propyl ditelluride and di-n-butyl ditelluride.<br>
Such compounds are prepared, for example, by reacting metallic tellurium with a compound represented by the formula (4) .<br>
Metallic tellurium is suspended in a solvent.  Examples<br>
of solvents usable are dimethylformamide (DMF), tetrahydrofuran (THF) and like polar solvents, toluene, xylene and like aromatic solvents, hexane and like aliphatic hydrocarbons, dialkyl ethers and like ethers.  THF is preferable among these.  The organic solvent is used usually in an amount of 1 to 100 ml, preferably 5 to 10 ml, per gram of metallic tellurium although the amount is suitably adjustable.<br>
The compound represented by the formula (4) is slowly added dropwise to the suspension, followed by stirring.  The reaction time is usually 5 minutes to 24 hours, preferably 10 minutes to 2 hours, although varying with the reaction temperature and pressure. ' The reaction temperature is -20°C to 80°C, preferably 15°C to 40°C, more preferably room temperature.  The reaction is conducted usually at atmospheric pressure, but an increased or reduced pressure is usable.<br>
Subsequently, water (which may be neutral water such as saline solution, alkali water such as aqueous solution of ammonium chloride, or acid water such as aqueous solution of hydrochloric acid) is added to the reaction mixture, followed by stirring. Although varying with the reaction temperature or pressure, the reaction time is usually 5 minutes to 24 hours, preferably 10 minutes to 2 hours.  The reaction temperature is -20°C to 80°C, preferably 15°C to 40°C, more preferably room temperature.  The reaction is conducted usually at atmospheric pressure, but an increased or reduced<br>
pressure is usable.<br>
Metallic tellurium and the compound of the formula (4) are used in such a ratio that 0.5 to 1.5 moles, preferably 0.8 to 1.2 moles, of the compound of the formula (4) is used per mole of metallic tellurAim.<br>
After the completion of the reaction, the solvent is concentrated, and the desired product is isolated from the concentrate and purified.  Although the compound can be purified by a suitably selected method, vacuum distillation or reprecipitation purification is usually desirable.<br>
Specifically stated, the living radical polymer of the present invention is produced by the process to be described below.<br>
A vinyl monomer, a living radical polymerization initiator represented by the formula (1) and a compound represented by the formula (2) are mixed together in a container having its inside air replaced by an inert gas. At this time, the initiator represented by the formula (1) and the compound of the formula (2) may be mixed together by stirring as the first step, followed by the second step of adding the vinyl monomer to the mixture.  Examples of inert gases usable at this time are nitrogen, argon, helium, etc., among which argon and nitrogen are preferred.  Nitrogen is especially preferred.<br>
Although the vinyl monomer and the initiator represented by the formula (1) are used in amounts which are<br>
suitably adjusted depending on the molecular weight and molecular weight distribution of the living radical polymer to be obtained, usually 5 to 10,000 moles, preferably 50 to 5,000 moles, of the vinyl monomer is used per mole of the initiator represented by the formula (1).<br>
To obtain a preferred mixture of living radical polymerization initiator of the formula (1) and compound of the formula (2), it is desirable to use an organotellurium compound of the formula (1) wherein R1 is C1-C4 alkyl, R2 and R3 are each a hydrogen atom or C^^-C^ alkyl, and R4 is aryl, substituted aryl or oxycarbonyl and a compound of the formula (2) wherein R1 is C1-C4 alkyl or phenyl.<br>
The living radical polymerization initiator represented by the formula (1) and the compound represented by the formula (2) are used in the ratio of usually 0.1 to 100 moles, preferably 0.5 to 100 moles, more preferably 1 to 10 moles, especially preferably 1 to S moles, of the compound of the formula (2) per mole of the initiator of the formula (1).<br>
The polymerization reaction is conducted usually in the absence of solvent, while an organic solvent generally in use for radical polymerization may be used.  Examples of solvents usable are benzene, toluene, N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), acetone, chloroform, carbon tetrachloride, tetrahydrofuran (THF), ethyl acetate, trifluoromethylbenzene, etc. Aqueous solvents are also usable which include, for example, water, methanol, ethanol,<br>
isopropanol, n-butanol, ethyl cellosolve, butyl cellosolve, 1-methoxy-2-propanol, etc.  The amount of the solvent to be used is adjusted suitably.  For example, 0.01 to 100 ml, preferably 0.05 to 10 ml, more preferably 0.05 to 0.5 ml, of the solvent is used per gram of the vinyl monomer.<br>
Next, the mixture is then stirred.  The reaction temperature and the reaction time may be adjusted suitably in accordance with the molecular weight or molecular weight distribution of the living radical polymer to be obtained. The mixture is stirred usually at 60 to 150'C for 5 to 100 hours, preferably at 80 to 120'C for 10 to 30 hours.  The reaction is conducted usually under atmospheric pressure, but may be conducted at increased pressure or in a vacuum.<br>
After the completion of the reaction, the solvent used and the remaining monomer are removed in a vacuum to take out the desired polymer, or the desired product is isolated by re-precipitation using a solvent wherein the product is insoluble.  The reaction mixture can be treated by any method insofar as it causes no problem to the desired product.<br>
Different kinds of vinyl monomers are usable in the process of the invention for preparing a living radical polymer.  For example when at least two kinds of vinyl monomers are reacted at the same time, a random copolymer can be obtained.  The random copolymer obtained is a polymer which comprises the reacted monomers in the original ratio (mole ratio) regardless of the kinds of the monomers. When a random<br>
copolymer is obtained by reacting a vinyl monomer A and a vinyl monomer B at the same time, the copolymer has substantially the same material ratio (mole ratio).  Further when two kinds' of vinyl monomers are reacted in succession, a block copolymer can be obtained.  The block copolymer is provided by the same order of reacted monomers regardless of the kinds of the monomers.  If a vinyl monomer A and a vinyl monomer B are reacted in succession to obtain a block copolymer, the polymer obtained is in the order of A-B or B-A in conformity with the order of monomers reacted.<br>
The living radical polymerization initiator of the present invention is adapted for excellent control of molecular weights and molecular weight distributions under very mild conditions.<br>
The living radical polymer to be obtained by the invention is adjustable in molecular weight according to the reaction time, the amount of the living radical polymerization initiator (organotellurium compound) of the formula (1) and the amount of the compound of the formula (2), and can be 500 to 1,000,000 in number average molecular weight.  The invention is especially suitable for producing living radical polymers having a number average molecular weight of,1,000 to 500,000, more preferably 1,000 to 50,000.<br>
The living radical polymer to be obtained by the invention is controlled to 1.05 to 1.50 in molecular weight distribution (PD = Mw/Mn).  The molecular weight distribution<br>
is controllable to a narrower range of 1.05 to 1.30, a further narrower range of 1.05 to 1.20, a still narrower range of 1.05 to 1.15.<br>
It has been found that the living radical polymer of the present invention has a terminal group which is an alkyl, aryl, substituted aryl, aromatic heterocyclic group, acyl, oxycarbonyl or cyano derived from the organotellurium compound and a growth terminal which is highly reactive tellurium.  Accordingly, the organotellurium compound used for radical polymerization makes it easier to convert the terminal group to other functional group than in the casjfc of the living radical polymer obtained by conventional living radical polymerization.  The living radical polymer obtained according to the invention is therefore usable as a macro living radical polymerization initiator (macroinitiator). A-B diblock copolymers such as methyl methacrylate-styrene and B-A diblock copolymers such as styrene-methyl methacrylate can be obtained using a macro living radical polymerization initiator of the invention. A-B-A triblock copolymers such as methyl methacrylate-styrene-methyl methacrylate and A-B-C triblock copolymers such as methyl methacrylate-styrene-butyl acrylate are also available.  This is attributable to the fact that the vinyl monomers of various different types are controllable by the living radical polymerization initiator and the ditellurium compound of the invention, and also to the fact that highly reactive<br>
tellurium is present at the growth terminal of the living radical polymer obtained with use of the living radical polymerization initiator.<br>
Stated more specifically, block copolymers are prepared by the processes to be described below.<br>
For preparing A-B diblock copolymers such as methyl methacrylate-styrene copolymer, methyl methacrylate, a living radical polymerization initiator represented by the formula (1) and a compound represented by the formula (2) are mixed together first as in the process described above for preparing a living radical polymer to obtain poly(methyl methacrylate), and subsequently mixing styrene with the polymer to obtain methyl methacrylate-styrene copolymer.<br>
A-B-A triblock copolymers and A-B-C triblock copolymers can be produced, for example, by preparing an A-B diblock copolymer by the above process and thereafter mixing a vinyl monomer (A) or vinyl monomer (C) with the copolymer to obtain the A-B-A or A-B-C triblock copolymer.<br>
In producing the diblock copolymer according to the invention, the compound of the formula (1) and the compound of the formula (2) can be used when a homopolymer is prepared from the first monomer and/or when the diblock copolymer is subsequently prepared.<br>
Further in producing the triblock copolymer according to the invention the compound of the formula (1) and the compound of the formula (2) can be used at least once when a<br>
homopolymer is prepared from the first monomer, or when a diblock copolymer is subsequently prepared, or when the triblock copolymer is subsequently prepared.<br>
The preparation of each block may be followed directly by the subsequent reaction for the next block, or the subsequent reaction for the next block may be initiated after the purification of the product resulting from the completion of the first reaction.  The block copolymer can be isolated by<br>
a usual method. i<br>
