				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>This invention relates to an improved cog useful for supporting underground mine roofs/tunnels.<br>
In underground mines, supporting of roofs is a very crucial factor and the mines need different types of supports for different purposes. In depillaring of coal pillars i.e, in the final extraction process they need a support of larger cross section (approx 1 m ) which is generally fabricated by wooden sleepers of 1.2 length and 5"x5" cross section. These sleepers are laid cross wise alternatively in a square form upto the roof height. These are called cogs (or Timber cogs).<br>
Wooden cogs take much time to be installed and also while being withdrawn. These supports are necessary at the vulnerable places of underground panels like goafedges, slices and junctions. These wooden supports have drawbacks that<br>
1.	It is cumbersome and time taking to erect/install<br>
2.	It is not possible to withdraw the support from a distance,<br>
one has to move near the support to dismantle it.<br>
3.	The supporting capacity is less.<br>
4.	Life of the cog support is also less as the life of woods in<br>
mines is short due to water and moisture.<br>
5.	Cannot provide any setting load to the roof.<br><br>
There are some steel cogs  available  which are generally made of steel angles/channels/square hollow sections /tubes etc.<br>
Reference may be made to Indian Patent application no.1006/CAL/1988 (Patent no. 170926) of the Tata Iron &amp; Steel Co. Ltd. The schematic of two embodiments are shown in Figs. 1 &amp; 2 of the drawings accompanying this specification.<br>
It is made of square hollow sections welded together to make a cube form of 1m x 1m x 1m  size. This 1m cube form of blocks are set together ( generally 3 nos.) one above another to make a height of 3m in the mines to support the roof. This one cubic metre block of square hollow tube is called TISCOG.<br>
Reference may also be made to our Indian Patent application no.854/DEL/89 (Patent No.78%7 ) - The schematic of the device is shown in Fig.3 of the drawings accompanying this specification.<br>
The device  is a quick setting chock for supporting the roofs of underground mines. It is made of 4 long pipes of 3m height having top cover and bottom plate made of steel angles welded together in a square form ( 1m x 1m). The 4 steel tubes are cross wise connected by to holder pieces.<br>
Some of the major disadvantages of these steel cogs are:<br>
Both the above referred cogs are rigid and fixed type, heavy<br><br>
to carry in underground, not suitable for very long height of working. These cannot provide any setting load against the roof and floor. They also take time to install in underground mines/tunnels. These are not suitable for variable height adjustment and also need manual presence while withdrawing the steel cogs at the working site.<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide an improved  cog useful for supporting underground mine/tunnel roofs which obviates  the drawbacks of the hitherto known cogs as detailed above.<br>
Another object is to provide an improved  cog suitable for quick setting mechanism,    very long height of extraction, variables height adjustment,  higher capacity,  easy and quick installation,  setting load at the time of installation and having remote withdrawal mechanism.<br>
In Figure-4 of the drawings accompanying this specification the schematic diagram of the improved cog of the present invention  is shown. The various components are an extendible tubular structure with a crown at the  top capable of holding wooden sleeper and a base frame and mechanism for holding the main tube A removable hydraulic jacking arrangement is incorporated for providing setting load.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides   an improved cog useful for supporting underground mine roofs/tunnels, which<br><br>
comprises one or more  vertical column (s) (3,5) extendible by means (4) such as a collar, the bottom of the column (5) being provided with a  base frame (6) having an adjustable vice arrangement (7,8) capable of  holding  the bottom portion of the said column (5), the said frame (6) being provided with a removable hydraulic jack (9,10) capable of providing vertical thrust to the column (s) (3,5), the top of the said column (3) being provided with a crown (2) having  a platen for holding the wooden sleeper(s) (1).<br>
The present invention  incorporates an improvement in the support technology in wide open areas in underground mines/tunnels. The sensitive zones which need heavy  and taller support can be properly  supported by this device of the present invention. Provision of support covering a large area can be executed very quickly.<br>
The operation of the improved cog of the present invention is detailed below:<br>
The top structure (2), the columns (3,5) and bottom structure (6) can be separately transported to the site of support erection. The bottom support (6) would be placed horizontality first and the columns (5) and (3) would be fixed by means of collar (4) and placed  accordingly. Then, the top frame (2) would be fixed with the top of column (3). The structure would be erected vertically up.  Then wooden sleepers  would be placed on the top platen of the crown  (2) to adjust the height as neces-<br><br>
sary to touch the mines roof. The jack (9) would be placed below the column  (5) fitted into base frame (6), Then the pump will be operated to lift the ram of jack for lifting up the columns (3,5) &amp; crown (2)  against the roof. When, the induced load by the jack to the columns &amp; crown  would be around 10 tone, the screw (s) (8) of adjustable vice  arrangement (7) will be operated to hold the bottom column  (5) in position Once the cog is set, the jack is withdrawn from the site.  At the time of releasing load, the screw (8) of the vice arrangement (7) is operated in opposite direction to get the two holder halves separated apart and thus allowing the columns (3,5) &amp; crown (2) to  come down lower and whole thing gets released. Thereafter, the steel cog can be remotely withdrawn once the load is released.<br>
The main advantages of the improved cog of the present invention are :<br>
1. It is dismantalable quickly.<br>
2. It is installable quickly.<br>
3. Members are light to carry.<br>
4. It can provide high axial load bearing capacity,<br><br>
5.	It is suitable for higher height of underground<br>
working/extract ion.<br>
6.	It is having facility of variable height adjustment<br>
7.	It can provide considerable setting load against roof.<br>
8.	It can be released easily and remotely.<br><br>
9.	It is easily repairable and hence maintenance cost  is  least<br>
and running cost is almost nil.<br>
10.	It replaces timber supports and thus environment friendly.<br>
11.	Life span of this support in quite high.<br>
12.	Economically viable.<br><br><br><br>
We Claim :<br>
1)	An improved  cog useful for supporting underground mine<br>
roofs/tunnels, which comprises one or more  vertical column<br>
(s) (3,5) extendible by means (4) such as a collar the<br>
bottom of the column (5) being provided with a  base frame<br>
(6) having an adjustable vice arrangement (7,8) capable of<br>
holding  the bottom portion of the said column (5), the said<br>
frame (6) being provided with a removable hydraulic jack<br>
(9,10) capable of providing vertical thrust to the column<br>
(s) (3,5), the top of the said column (3) being provided<br>
with a crown (2) having  a platen for holding wooden sleep-<br>
er(s) (1).<br>
2)	An improved cog useful for supporting underground mine<br>
roofs/tunnels, substantially as herein described with refer-<br>
ence to Fig 4 of the drawings accompanying this specifica-<br>
t ion.<br></td>
