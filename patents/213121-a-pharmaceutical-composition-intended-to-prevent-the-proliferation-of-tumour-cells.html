The present invention relates to a novei use of ccmpounds having good affinity for the receptors ~c v;hich cis-M-cyclohexyl-N-ethyi [3- ( 3-chloro-4-cycio-hexylphenyl )allyl]amine binds, as well as to novel com¬pounds having the same properties.<br>
cis-N-Cyclohexyl-N-ethyl[3-(3-chlcro-4-cycIo-hexylphenyi) allyl]amine, also known under the code CM 31747 or SR 31747 and referred to hereinbelow as ^^SR 31747", is described in EP 376,350 which also dis¬cusses its immunosuppressant activity. It has been found that SR 31747 prevents cancer cells from prolif¬erating and that, consequently, it can exert antitumour<br>
activity.<br>
Furthermore/ it has been found that SR 31747 has receptor sites on these cells.<br>
Lastly, it has been found that any product capable of displacing tritiated SR 31747 from its receptors on tumour cells prevents cell proliferation. More particularly, it has been observed that' compounds capable of displacing tritiated SR 31747 (referred to hereinbelow as "3H-SR 31747") from its receptor sites have activity in preventing cell proliferation.<br>
Thus, according to .one of its aspects, the present invention relates ,to the use of compounds capable of displacing tritiated cis-N-cyclohexyl-N-ethyl[3-(3-chloro-4-cyclohexylphenyl)allyl]amine from its receptors for the preparation of pharmaceutical compositions intended to combat cell proliferation, The capacity of the compounds envisaged for the use accord¬ing to the present invention of displacing tritiated SR 31747 from its receptors may readily be determined biochemically using 3H-SR 31747 and binding it to the cells .<br>
This determination may be carried out with tumour cells chosen appropriately, preferably from cell lines which proliferate readily in vitro, for example human myeloma, kidney carcinoma or human lung cells or alternatively on mammary carcinoma cells.<br><br>
In the context of the present invention, in order to be able to carry out the determinations under: standardized conditions making it possible to obtain constant and reproducible results, a human mammary tumour cell line 'MCF-7" was chosen arbitrarily.<br>
Also, in the context of the present invention, -'H-SR 31747 was chosen arbitrarily, in which the trit¬ium is bound to the vinylene bond, but the SR 31747 may be labelled in any way at all since the labelling serves only to monitor the displacement of the product from its receptors.<br>
Determination of the capacity to displace ■"H-SR 31747 from its receptors present on cells, in particular cells of the MCF-7 cell line, was carried out by performing tests of total binding and of spe¬cific binding.<br>
According to the present invention, any product which, when subjected to the above preliminary opera¬tion, is capable of displacing 'H-SR 31747 from its receptors may be used for the preparation of pharmaceu¬tical compositions to combat cell proliferation, SR 31747 is, firstly, capable of displacing -"H-SR 31747 from its receptors and possesses powerful inhibitory activity on cell proliferation. More particularly, the subject of the present invention is the use of a com¬pound capable of displacing tritiated cis-N-cyclohexyl-N-ethyl [3- (3-chloro-4-cyclohexylphenyl) allyl]amine from its receptors, chosen from the group consisting of: a) amines of formula<br><br><br><br>

Reaction of the functional derivative of the acid (IX) with the amine (X) takes place according to the standard procedures for the preparation of amides. As a functional derivative of the acid (IX), any common compound of peptide chemistry may be used, for example the chloride, the anhydride, a mixed anhydride, for example with carbonic acid monoethyl ester (obtained by reacting the acid (IX) with ethyl chloroformate), an activated ester or an activated amide. When, as a functional derivative, the chloride or the anhydride is used, it may be advantageous to work in the presence of a tertiary amine, for example triethylamine.<br>
The compound (XI) may also be reduced under the standard conditions for converting an amide into an amine, using a metal iodide such as lithium aluminium hydride or borane as reducing agent. The reaction between the acetylene derivatives (XII) or zhe acetophenones (XV) and the amines (XIII) and (XIV) in the presence of formaldehyde is carried out under the standard conditions of the Mannich reaction.<br><br>
Redactien cf the compounds of formula (.'/III, , m which Z has one of the structures (2) or (3; v;here Gi^ and G4 form two bonds, is carried out cy hydrogenation with one mole of hydrogen in order to obtain the compounds (VIII) (Z = structure 2 or 3 where G3 + G4 form a bond of cis configuration) or with two moles of hydrogen in order to obtain the saturated compounds,<br>
Reduction of the compound of formula (XVI) m order to obtain the compounds of formula {VIII) m which Z has one of the structures (2) or (3) where G; IS hydroxyl and G4 is hydrogen, is carried out according to the standard methods. When it is desired to obtain a hydroxy compound having a specific configuration on the chiral carbon atom, a stereospecific reducing agent may be used.<br>
When the hydroxyl at ed derivative musr then be dehydrated in order to obtain a compound of formula (VIII), in which Z has one of the structures (2) or (3) where G3 and G4 form a bond, the stereoconf iguration plays no role and the 'compound (XVI) may be reduced, for example, with sodium borohydride.<br>
The optional dehydration of the compound of formula (VIII), in which Z has one of the structures (2) or (3) where G3 is hydroxyl and G4 is hydrogen, is carried out by heating in the presence of agents or apparatus which promote the removal and/or uptake of water, for example using Dean-Stark apparatus.<br>
The configuration of the unsaturated compound (VIII) thus obtained is trans. This compound may m turn be hydrogenated in order to prepare an amine of formula (VIII) in which Z has one of the structures (2) or (3) where G3 and G4 are hydrogen.<br>
The starting acids of formula (IX) and their functional derivatives, as well as the amides of formula (XI), are novel products which may be prepared from a 4- ( 4"Cyclohexyl-3,5-L-L' -phenyl)-4-oxobutyric acid.<br><br>
More par~icularly, the acids of formula ax are obta ined DV reduction of the kezoPie r.o -4 - 4-cycIohexyl-3,5-L-L'-phenyl)-4-oxobutyric acid (L and L' being as defined above) m order to obtain 4 - 4 cyclohexyl-3,5-L-L'-phenyl)'4-hydroxybutyric acid whicn is converted into its lactone. This lactone is chlorinated and converted into 4-chloro-4-{4-cyclohexyl-3,S-L-L'-phenyl)butyric acid ester which m turn gives, on cyclization, the cyclopropanecarboxylic<br>
acid (IX).<br>
The 4- ( 4-cyclohexyl-3, S-L-L -phenyl) --4-oxo¬butyric acids (L and L' being as defined above) are prepared in the following way:<br>
•	when L and L' represent H, according to N, P. Buu-Hoi<br>
et al,,   Bull, Sec. Chim, France, 1944, 127;<br>
•	when L represents H, L' represents CI according to F,<br>
Krausz et al. , Arzneim.-Forsh., 1974, 24, 1364-1367;<br>
BE 750,233;<br>
■ when L represents H, L' represents NO: according to BE 750,233;<br>
•	when L and L' represent CI, according to F. Krausz et<br>
al., Arzneim-Forsch., 1974, 24,    1364-1367;<br>
when L represents H, L' represents F by catalytic hydrogenation of 3- (4-cyclohexyl-3-fluoro)benzoyl-acrylic acid, which is itself described in JP 75770/71 and DE 2,103,749.<br><br><br><br>
in which Alk' is a (C1-C4) alkyl;<br>
- compound (XX) thus obtained is cyclized by heating in<br>
the  presence  of  potassium  t-butoxide  and  the<br>
cyclopropanecarboxylic  acid  of  formula   (IX)   is<br>
isolated.<br>
The acids of formula (IX), their salts, their functional derivatives, in particular the chloride, the anhydride and the mixed anhydride with a mono™(C1-C4)alkyl ester of carbonic acid, as well as the amides of formula (XI), are novel products which constitute a further aspect of the present invention.<br>
Thus, the present invention also relates to a compound of formula (XXI)<br><br><br>
in which L and L'  are as defined above and W is a hydroxyl group or a group of structure -NG1G1 where:<br>

According to biochemical and pharmacological studies, exposure of the compounds used according to the invention to normal cells, under the same conditions as those which make it possible to obtain an antiproliferative activity on cancer cells, does not give rise to any detrimental effect on all the criteria examined, such as, for example, the integrity of the structures and of the cell functions or the maintenance of the viability. These products thus act with great specificity of action with respect to tumour cells* The antitumour activity was established on several human tumour lines in vitro and in vivo in mice- The cells used were all obtained from the ATCC international collection. MCF'7 cells were used to perform the binding studies,<br>
The membranes were prepared as follows: 10 MCF-7 cells are homogenized for 10 seconds on a Polytron*' in 10 ml of Hepes^ buffer pH = 7.4 containing: 210 mM D-mannitol, 70 mM sucrose, 1 mM EDTA, 0.3 mM PMSF.

The antitumour activity is measured according to the colorimetry method using MTT, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazole-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium) bromide as described by Mosmann T., Journ. of Imm. Methods; 1983, 65,   55,<br>
This colorimetrie assay makes it possible to measure quantitatively the antitumour activity of a solution containing a compound used according to the invention.<br>
According to the procedure used, the suspended cells  (such as the myeloma cells) are inoculated at<br><br>
2xl03 cells/mi in 1 mi welis ^ m defined medium. 7n^ adherent ceils (such as the MCr-7 ceiis) are mocuiatec at 5x104 cells/ml m 1 ml wells in RPMI medium +0.5"; FCS overnight. The next day, the cell carpet is washed twice and replaced by the defined medium.<br>
The defined m.edium corresponds to: RPMI + 10 ug/ml insulin + 10 ug/ml human transferrin.<br>
In order to carry out this test, cells are maintained in the presence of the solution containing a compound used according to the invention for 5 days, and the MTT is then added to the culture medium.<br>
The 5 day period which was selected corresponds to the optimum time for the activity. After culturing for 5 days, the proliferation of the cells is measured by the test described above. The optical density at 570 nm is measured. A blue coloration develops in the wells where the cells are still alive. The intensity of the coloration is proportional to the quantity of live cells .<br>

The effect observed in vivo of inhibition of an MCF-7 cell line was studied m vivo in 'nude' mice/ intraperitoneally at doses of between 3 and 10 0 mg/kg in a model according to Neri C, et al.; Cancer Research, 1990, 50; 58 92-5897 and according to Berebbi M., et   al.;   Oncogene, 1990, 5; 505-509.<br>
Another study was also performed in order to determine the effect of SR 31747 on the in vitro and in vi^^o growth of mammary and prostate epithelial tumour cells -<br>
The study consisted in evaluating the potential antitumour activity of SR 31747 on the growth of a variety of cancerous breast epithelial lines. The study is carried out in vitro on cell cultures, as well as m vivo after inoculation of tumoral mammary lines in 'nude*' athymic mice.<br>
The cell lines which were used are as follows:<br>
The hormone-sensitive MCF-7 line originates from a pleural effusion of a breast adenocarcinoma. The antioestrogen-resistant MCF-7LY2 cells were obtained from the MCF-7 line by selective pressure in the presence of a high-affinity antioestrogen. The MCF-7LCC1 and MCF-7LCC2 lines were developed in nude mice, after inoculation of the MCF-7 cells. The two lines are oestrogen-independent. The MCF-7LCC2 cells are also antioestrogen-resistant. The MCF-7AZTD5 line is derived from the MCF-7 line after stable transfeetion with the H-ras oncogene. The MCF-7AZTD5 cells are antioestrogen-resistant in vitro. All of these lines are maintained on DMEM/F12 (1/1, vol/vol) containing 10% decomplemented foetal calf serum and 16 ng/ml of human insulin. The MCF-7LCC2 line is cultured in the permanent presence of 10' M hydroxytamoxifen. The MDA'MB231 tumoral mammary epithelial cells are oestrogen- and antioestrogen-insensitive.   They  are  cultured  in  L15  medium<br><br>
suppiemented with 10% FCS, 1% essential aip.ino acids and 10 µg/ml of human insulin.<br>
The InCaP, PC3 and DU145 epithelial lines are derived from prostate adenocarcinomas. Only the LnCa? cells are hormone-sensitive. The three lines are cultured in RPMI supplemented with 10% FC3.<br>
All the lines are maintained at 37°^0 m a humid air/CO; (95%/5%) atmosphere, except for the MDA-MB251 cells which are cultured in the absence of CO.. The cell lines are checked regularly free of mycoplasms.<br>
The inoculation and treatment of the animals were carried out as follows:<br>
The  animals  used  are  "nude"  female  athymic mice, which may or may not have been ovariectomized, obtained  at  4  weeks  old   (R.   Janvier) .   Before inoculating the hormone-sensitive mammary cells (MCF-7, MCF-'7AZTD5) ,  the animals receive  10 µl of ethanolic 10-5 M ©estradiol solution applied percutaneously. The treatment is repeated three times over one week. One million  cells  suspended  in  100 ul  of  PBS/Ca'  are inoculated subcutaneously above each of the hips. The following day, the animals receive 200 ul of injection solution   (ethanol/Tween   80/physiological   saline, 1/1/18,  vol/vol)  containing the various reactants at the predefined concentrations. The injections are made intraperitoneally and are repeated every day. RESULTS<br>
In vitro activity of SR 31747 on the proliferation of various tumoral breast epithelial lines<br>
The results relating to the effect of SR 31747 on the proliferation of mammary epithelial cells in culture are given in Table 3. The activity of SR 31747 was evaluated in the presence of various concentrations of saline. In the presence of reduced concentrations of saline, SR 31747 exerts an inhibitory action on the proliferation of all the tumoral epithelial lines tested. Larger amounts of saline in the culture media partially or totally antagonize the inhibitory activity of SR 31747 on the cell growth.<br><br>
For a given serai concentration^ zhe capacity of SR 31747 to inhibit the proi if eration aiso varies according to the line considered. In the presence ot 0.1% FCS, which makes it possible both to maintain a minimum cell proliferation and to observe a consequeni activity of SR 31747, the IC50 determined for the hormone-sensitive MCF-7 lines (MCF-7, MCF-7AZ, MCF-7 22HTB) ranges from 2x10-9 M to 7x10" M. Similar IC-values are also obtained for the MDA-MB231 and MCF-7LCC cells. On the other hand, the MCF-7AZTD5 and MCF-7LY2 lines show greater sensitivities to the inhibitory action of SR 31747 since the ICsc- values determined are 2x10"'"' to 5x10-11 M respectively.<br>
In all cases, the virtually total inhibitions of the cell proliferation observed m the presence of 10-6 M and occasionally 10"' M SR 31747 are, from all evidence, cytotoxic effects.<br>
The results obtained also indicate that SR 31747 is incapable of reversing the stimulatory action of oestradiol on the hormone-sensitive MCF-7 line,<br>

In vivo effect of SR 31747 on the frequency and size of tumours developed after inoculation of tumoral mammary epithelial lines in "nude" mice<br>
Figures 1 and 2 indicate the effect of SR 31747 on tumours developed in ovariectomized 'nude' mice from MDA-MB231 cells.<br>
Each mouse receives 5x10' MDA'MB231 cells above each hip (i.e. 2 points of inoculation per mouse). The animals are then treated daily via the intraperitoneal<br><br>
route and receive 500 ug SR 31747 - D,003 u--^ Z2 (20 m,ice). The control batch receives 0.003 ua Z2 (20 mice). The amount (as a percentage of inoculated turriours) and size of the tumours developed are deter^ mined at different times in the course of the treat¬ment. At the end of the treatment (day 92), the animals are sacrificed and weighed. The tumours are removed and weighed.<br>
The figures show that SR 31747 has a tendency to reduce the size, weight and frequency of tum.ours developed in ovariectomized nude mice from MDA-M32 31 cells. However, the differences in the size and weight of the tumours between control groups and SR 31747 do not appear to be significant, due to the large vari¬ability observed in each group.<br>
Thus, in vitro SR 31747 has antiproliferative activity on the proliferation of all of the mamm.ary tumoral epithelial cells studied. This activity 15 especially apparent in the presence of reduced concen¬trations of seruiu, and varies as a function of the lines considered. Although, in most cases, the IC: values measured in 0.1% FCS vary between 2x10-2 M and 2x10-8 M, an extreme sensitivity of the MCF-7LY2 cells to SR 31747 is, however, observed,<br>
A general tendency of SR 31747 to reduce, at the same time, the size, weight and frequency of tumours developed from MDA-MB2 31 cells is observed. The present invention also relates to a technique of in vivo imaging of tumours which uses as target, for the compounds used according to the invention radio-labelled, for example, with 123I, 23F, 11C or 23N, the receptors to which the ■'H SR 31747 binds, The reason for this is that the high density of these receptors in tumour cells has suggested that they may advantageously be used to bind the radioligands using the PET (positron emission tomography) and SPECT (single photon emission tomography) techniques.<br>
The present invention thus relates also to the use of compounds radiolabelled with isotopes that are<br><br>
well  known  to  those  skilled  in  the  art as     imaging agents for radiolabelling.<br>
Moreover, other imaging techniques involving an antigen-radiolabelled antibody complex may be used.<br>
Such methods include, but are not limited to, the SPECT technique or the technique known as PET.<br>
The use of the compounds according to the invention also comprises the preparation of medicinal products intended for therapy involving the targeting of radiolabelled products as radiation-releasing agents close to or in the tumour itself/ using the said com¬pounds to target radiolabelled products onto the tumour or into its immediate environment in order to subject the tumour ceils to the radiation emitted by the said radiolabelled products.<br>
The use of the compounds according to the invention may also comprise a step of radiotherapy in which the cells in contact with the compounds undergo the effect of ionizing radiation including, for exam¬ple, gamma-rays, beta-rays, X-rays or alpha particles which may be delivered by an external source as for the X-rays or gamma-rays, or by radionucleides which are administered directly to the patient as described, for example, in Principles of Radiation Therapy in Cancer, Principles and Practice of Oncology, Devita, V.T. et ai. eds, 4th ed. J.B. Lippincott Co. Philadelphia, 1993, 15,   248-275.<br>
These compounds may also be administered in combination with other anticancer active principles which are well known to those skilled in the art.<br>
