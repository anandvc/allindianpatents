THREE MODE, MULTI-SPEED TRANSMISSION<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001]	The present invention relates to a power transmission having at least two<br>
planetary gear sets and three modal torque-transmitting mechanisms successively engagable with other torque-transmitting mechanisms to provide three modes of speed ratios with single transition shifts.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002]	Currently available transmissions for heavy working machinery typically<br>
have a multi-speed "input" section driving into either a two-speed high/low ratio "splitter" section or a three speed high/medium/low ratio "splitter" section. By successively engaging torque-transmitting mechanisms in the input section ("input torque-transmitting mechanisms") with the splitter section torque-transmitting mechanisms a shift sequence is achieved. For instance, if the input section includes torque-transmitting mechanisms A, B, C and the splitter section includes torque-transmitting mechanisms low (L), medium (M) and high (H) then the shift sequence would be AL-BL-CL—AM-BM-CM—AH-BH-CH. This shift sequence has single transition shifting except for two undesirable center shifts, i.e., CL to AM and CM to AH. These are double transition shifts which compromise shift quality, shift time and durability of the internal gears.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0003]	The present invention provides an improved transmission, especially for<br>
heavy working machinery, with a high number of ratios, very uniform steps and low internal speeds. The transmission has two "rear" planetary gear sets that are uniquely constructed to provide modal operation as explained herein. A "front" section provides power flow input to the rear planetary gear sets using either a modal torque-transmitting mechanism or an input torque-transmitting mechanism, providing multiple input speed<br><br>
2<br>
ratios. The rear two planetary gear sets are operatively connected with two other modal torque-transmitting mechanisms and a reverse brake. The transmission provides up to three ratios in a first mode, a first transition speed ratio between the first mode and the second mode, up to three additional speed ratios in the second mode, a second transition speed ratio between the second mode and a third mode, and up to three speed ratios in the third mode. Thus, if three input torque-transmitting mechanisms are provided, potentially eleven speed ratios (or corresponding torque ratios) may be achieved. Up to three reverse ratios may be achieved. The third mode speed ratios may include one or more overdrive ratios or the transmission may operate without overdrive depending on gear tooth counts selected.<br>
[0004]	In the transmission, input to the rear planetary gear sets from the multi-<br>
speed input torque-transmitting mechanisms increases in the first mode, decreases in the second mode and increases again in the third mode.<br>
[0005]	Specifically, an automatic transmission is provided that has first and<br>
second planetary gear sets (the rear planetary gear sets) each having a first member, a second member and a third member. A first modal torque-transmitting mechanism is selectively engagable to connect one of the members of the first planetary gear set with a stationary member such as the transmission housing. A second modal torque-transmitting mechanism is selectively engagable to establish power flow to a member of the second planetary gear set. A third modal torque-transmitting mechanism is selectively engagable to connect any two members of one of the first and second planetary gear sets. First and second input torque-transmitting mechanisms are separately selectively engagable to establish power flow at a different member of one of the first and second planetary gear sets than the member at which power flow is established via engagement of the second modal torque-transmitting mechanism. The speed of the--member at which power flow is established by engagement of the first or the second input torque-transmitting mechanism increases, then deceases, then increases, respectively, as the first and second input torque-transmitting mechanisms are engaged in successive order while the first modal torque-transmitting mechanism is engaged, in<br><br>
3<br>
reverse order while the second modal torque-transmitting mechanism is engaged, and in<br>
successive order while the third modal torque-transmitting mechanism is engaged.<br>
[0006]	A plurality of gear members (the front section) include a first gear member<br>
continuously connected with the input member, a second gear member continuously connected with the member that increases, then decreases, then increases in speed as described above, and a third gear member continuously connected with the member at which power flow is established via engagement of the second modal torque-transmitting mechanism. As used herein, 'gear member' within the claimed plurality of gear members may include a ring gear member, a sun gear member or a pinion gear member and may also include a carrier member which rotatably supports the pinion gear members.<br>
[0007]	The transmission has an input member and an output member. Preferably,<br>
the first and second input torque-transmitting mechanisms are engagable in successive order while the first modal torque-transmitting mechanism is engaged to establish respectively increasing first modal speed ratios between the input member and the output member, in reverse order while the second modal torque-transmitting mechanism is engaged to establish respectively increasing second modal speed ratios between the input member and the output member, and in successive order while the third modal torque-transmitting mechanism is engaged to establish respectively increasing third modal speed ratios between the input member and the output member. Speed ratio, as used herein, is the ratio of the speed of the output member to the speed of the input member. Torque ratio is the ratio of the torque of the output member to the torque of the input member. As torque ratio decreases, speed ratio increases.<br>
[0008]	Additionally, the first and second modal torque-transmitting mechanisms<br>
may be simultaneously engagable to establish a first transition speed ratio between the input member and the output member, with a single transition shift between the first transition speed ratio and both of said first and second modal speed ratios. The first transition speed ratio has a numerical value greater than the first modal speed ratio and less than the second modal speed ratio. Similarly, the second modal torque-transmitting mechanism and the third modal torque-transmitting mechanism may be simultaneously<br><br>
4<br>
engaged to establish a second transition speed ratio between the input member and the output member, with a single transition shift between the second transition speed ratio and both of the second and third modal speed ratios. The second transition speed ratio has a numerical value greater than the second modal speed ratio and less than the third modal speed ratio. The ability of the transmission to provide the first and second transition speed ratios eliminates undesirable double transition shifts typically encountered with transmissions having a "splitter" section.<br>
[0009]	Preferably a third input torque-transmitting mechanism is provided that is<br>
selectively engagable to establish power flow at the same gear member at which the first<br>
and second input torque-transmitting mechanisms establish power flow. The third input<br>
torque-transmitting mechanism is engagable with the first modal torque-transmitting<br>
mechanism, with the second modal torque-transmitting mechanism and with the third<br>
modal torque-transmitting mechanism to establish another first modal speed ratio,<br>
another second modal speed ratio and another third modal speed ratio, respectively.<br>
[0010]	Preferably, a reverse torque-transmitting mechanism is provided that is<br>
selectively engagable to connect one of the members of the second planetary gear set with the stationary member. The first, second and the third input torque-transmitting mechanisms are successively engagable while the reverse torque-transmitting mechanism is engaged to establish different reverse speed ratios between the input member and the output member.<br>
[0011]	The reverse torque-transmitting mechanism enables an unique lock-out<br>
feature. Specifically, engagement of the reverse torque-transmitting mechanism with the first modal torque-transmitting mechanism prevents rotation of the output member to prevent rolling on steep grades.<br>
[0012]	The input torque-transmitting mechanisms may be operatively connected<br>
to additional planetary gear sets or to gears in a counter-shaft layout located between the input member and the first and second planetary gear sets. If three input torque-transmitting mechanisms are provided, up to eleven speed ratios may be achieved, although as few as seven may be utilized depending on the step and ratios desired. For instance, a direct, single overdrive or dual overdrive top ratio may be utilized. The rear<br><br>
5<br>
planetary gear sets (i.e., the first and second planetary gear sets) have two separate interconnected pairs of members. Additionally, the first modal torque-transmitting mechanism connects one of the members of the first planetary gear set with the stationary member. The transmission provides very deep start ratios.<br>
[0013]	The above features and advantages and other features and advantages of<br>
the present invention are readily apparent from the following detailed description of the best modes for carrying out the invention when taken in connection with the accompanying drawings.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS Schematic Block Diagram of the Transmission<br>
[0038]	Referring to the drawings, wherein like reference numbers represent the<br>
same or corresponding parts through out the several views, a powertrain 10 shown in Figure 1 in block diagram form, is representative of each of the specific transmission embodiments described below. The powertrain 10 has an engine 12 and torque converter 13, a transmission 14 and a final drive mechanism 16. The transmission 14 includes an input member or shaft 17 continuously connected with the engine 12, (either directly or through the torque converter 13) and an output member of shaft 19 is continuously connected with a final drive mechanism 16. The planetary transmission 14 includes a front section 11 (also referred to as an input section) configured to establish power flow to a rear section 15 (also referred to as an output section) to establish various speed ratios between the input member 17 and the output member 19. The front section 11 may be comprised of planetary gear sets or may be a countershaft gear arrangement. The rear section 15 includes first and second planetary gear sets which may be referred to herein as modal planetary gear sets. The front section 11 includes multiple input section torque-transmitting mechanisms A, B, and C, as well as a second mode clutch (Mil). The rear section 15 includes a first mode brake (MI) engagable to ground a member of one of the modal planetary gear sets to the transmission housing. The rear section 15 also includes a reverse brake (REV) selectively engagable to ground different members of the modal planetary gear sets to the transmission housing. Additionally, a third mode clutch (Mill) is selectively engagable to connect any two members of one of the modal planetary gear sets. When only one of the input section torque-transmitting mechanisms A, B or C is engaged and clutch Mll is not engaged, power flow is established between the front section 11 and the rear section 15 only along power flow path D. If the Mil clutch is engaged and none of the input torque-transmitting mechanisms A, B, C are engaged, power flow is established between the front section 11 and the rear section 15 only along<br><br>
8<br>
the power flow path E. If clutch Mil is engaged along with one of the input torque-transmitting mechanisms, A, B or C, power flow is established between the front section 11 and the rear section 15 is along both power flow paths D and E.<br>
[0039]	Eleven potential forward speed ratios may be achieved in the transmission<br>
14 by the following engagement schedule:<br>
A, MI; B, MI; C, Ml - MI, MIl - MIl, C; MIl, B; MIl, A -- MIl, MIll - MIll, A; MIll, B; MIll, C<br>
Three reverse speed ratios are achieved by engaging REV and A, REV and B, and REV and C. The first three forward speed ratios, established by engaging A and MI, B and MI and C and MI, establish a first mode, Mode I; the fifth sixth, and seventh ratios established by engaging C and Mil, B and Mil, and A and Mil establish a second mode, Mode II. The ninth, tenth and eleventh speed ratios established by engaging A and Mill, B and Mill, and C and Mill, establish a third mode, Mill. The fourth speed ratio established by engagement of the brake MI and the clutch Mil is a first transition speed ratio with a numerical value greater than the Mode I ratios and less than the Mode II ratios. The eighth speed ratio established by engaging the clutch Mil and the clutch Mill establishes a second transition mode speed ratio with a numerical value greater than the second mode speed ratios and less than the third mode speed ratios. The modal nature of the engagement schedule allows. for the single transition shifts utilized. Under this engagement schedule, the member of the modal planetary gear set which receives power flow from the front section 11 along power flow path D increases in speed during Mode I, decrease in speed during Mode II and increases in speed again during Mode III. The modal nature of the transmission 14 is also present in each of the transmission embodiments depicted in Figures 2 -24, as described below. First Transmission Embodiment<br>
[0040]	Referring to Figure 2, a powertrain 100 has an engine 12, a torque<br>
converter 13, a transmission 114 and a final drive mechanism 16. The transmission 114 may be characterized by front section 11 and rear section 15.<br><br>
9<br>
[0041]	The transmission 114 includes an input shaft 17 continuously connected to<br>
the engine 12 either through the torque converter 13 or by engagement of a torque converter lock-up clutch 18 which effectively bypasses the torque converter 13. The output shaft 19 is continuously connected with the final drive mechanism 16. The transmission 114 includes five planetary gear sets 20, 30, 40, 50 and 60. The planetary gear set 20 is referred to in the claims as the first planetary gear set and the planetary gear set 30 is referred to in the claims as the second planetary gear set. The planetary gear sets 20 and 30 are part of the rear section 15 and the planetary gear sets 40, 50 and 60 are considered part of the front section 11 and are referred to in the claims as a plurality of gear members.<br>
[0042]	The planetary gear set 20 includes a sun gear member 22, a ring gear<br>
member 24 and a carrier member 29 on which a plurality of pinion gears 27 are rotatably supported and disposed in meshing relationship with both the sun gear member 22 and the ring gear member 24.<br>
[0043]  The planetary gear set 30 includes a sun gear member 32, a ring gear member 34 and a carrier member 39 on which a plurality of pinion gears 37 are rotatably supported and disposed in meshing relationship with the sun gear member 32 and the ring gear member 34.<br>
[0044]	The planetary gear set 40 includes a sun gear member 42, a ring gear<br>
member 44 and a carrier member 49 on which a plurality of pinion gear 47 are rotatably supported in meshing relationship with both the sun gear member 42 and the ring gear member 44.<br>
[0045]	The planetary gear set 50 includes a sun gear member 52, a ring gear<br>
member 54, and a carrier member 59 which rotatably supports a plurality of pinion gears 57 that are disposed in meshing relationship with both the sun gear member 52 and the ring gear member 54.<br>
[0046]	The planetary gear set 60 includes a sun gear member 62, ring gear<br>
member 64 and a carrier member 69 which rotatably supports a plurality of pinion gears 67 that are disposed in meshing relationship with both the sun gear member 62 and the ring gear member 54.<br><br>
10<br>
[0047]	The input shaft 17 is continuously connected with the carrier member 69.<br>
The carrier member 69 is continuously connected with the ring gear member 54 through an interconnecting member 70. The ring gear member 64 is continuously connected with the sun gear member 32 as well as the sun gear member 22 through an interconnecting member 72. The interconnecting member 72, as with all other interconnecting members, may be one component or separate components. The carrier member 59 is continuously connected with the ring gear member 44 though an interconnecting member 74. The carrier member 49 is continuously connected with the carrier member 39 through an interconnecting member 76. The ring gear member 34 is continuously connected with the carrier member 29 through an interconnecting member 78. The sun gear member 32 is continuously connected with the sun gear member 22 through the interconnecting member 72. The sun gear member 52 is continuously connected with the transmission housing 80.<br>
[0048]	The ring gear member 64 and the sun gear members 22 and 32 are<br>
selectively connectable with the carrier member 59 and the ring gear member 44 through an input torque-transmitting mechanism clutch A. The sun gear member 62 is selectively connectable with the carrier member 69 and with the ring gear member 54 through the input torque-transmitting mechanism clutch B. The sun gear member 62 is selectively grounded to the transmission housing 80 (a stationary member) through the input torque-transmitting mechanism brake C.<br>
[0049]	A first modal torque-transmitting mechanism, brake MI, selectively<br>
connects the ring gear member 24 with the transmission housing 80. A second modal torque-transmitting mechanism, brake Mil, selectively connects the sun gear member 42 with the transmission housing 80. A third modal torque-transmitting mechanism, clutch Mill, selectively connects the sun gear member 32 (and the sun gear member 22) with carrier member 39 (and with carrier member 49 via interconnecting member 76). A reverse torque-transmitting mechanism, brake REV, selectively connects the carrier member 39 (and therefore also carrier member 49 via interconnecting member 76) with the transmission housing 80.<br><br>
11<br>
[0050]	As shown in Figure 3, the torque-transmitting mechanisms are selectively<br>
engaged in combinations of two to provide nine forward speed ratios and three reverse ratios. (Torque ratios are listed; those skilled in the art will readily understand the relationship between torque ratio and speed ratio (i.e., as torque ratios successively decrease, speed ratios successively increase). The torque-transmitting mechanisms are preferably multiple disk-type, fluid actuated friction drive establishing devices which are commonly used in planetary gear transmissions.<br>
[0051]	The third reverse speed ratio, R3, is established with the engagement of<br>
the brake C and the brake REV. The brake C connects the sun gear member 62 with the transmission housing 80, and the brake REV connects the carrier members 39 and 49 with the transmission housing 80. The carrier member 69 and the ring gear member 54 rotate at the same speed as the input shaft 17. The sun gear member 62, sun gear member 52, carrier member 49, and carrier member 39 do not rotate. Ring gear member 64 rotates at the same speed as sun gear member 32 and sun gear member 22. Ring gear member 64 rotates at a speed determined from the speed of the carrier 69 and the ring gear/sun gear tooth ratio of the planetary gear set 60. Ring gear member 34 and carrier member 29 rotate at the same speed as the output member 19. Ring gear member 34, and therefore the output member 19, rotates at a speed determined from the speed of the sun gear member 32 and the ring gear/sun gear tooth ratio of the planetary gear set 30. The numerical value of the third reverse (R3) speed ratio is determined utilizing the ring gear/sun gear tooth ratios of the planetary gear sets 30 and 60.<br>
[0052]	The second reverse speed ratio (R2) is established with the engagement of<br>
the clutch B and the brake REV. The clutch B connects the carrier member 69 with the sun gear member 62, and the brake REV connects the carrier member 39 with the transmission housing 80. The planetary gear set 60, the ring gear member 54, the sun gear member 32 and the sun gear member 22 rotate at the same speed as the input member 17. The sun gear member 52 and the carrier members 49 and 39 do not rotate. The ring gear member 34 and the carrier member 29 rotate at the same speed as the output member 19. The ring gear member 34, and therefore the output member 19, rotates at a speed determined from the speed of the sun gear member 32 and the ring<br><br><br>
12<br>
gear/sun gear tooth ratio of the planetary gear set 30. The numerical value of the second reverse (R2) speed ratio is determined utilizing the ring gear/sun gear tooth ratio of the planetary gear set 30.<br>
[0053]	The first reverse speed ratio (Rl) is established with the engagement of the<br>
clutch A and the brake REV. The clutch A connects the ring gear member 44 with the sun gear member 32 and the brake REV connects the carrier member 39 with the transmission housing 80.

49	rotates at the same speed as the carrier member 39. The carrier member 49 rotates at a<br>
speed determined from the speed of the ring gear member 44 and the ring gear/sun gear<br>
tooth ratio of the planetary gear set 40. The sun gear members 22 and 32 rotate at the<br>
same speed as the ring gear member 64. The ring gear member 34 and the carrier<br>
member 29 rotate at the same speed as the output member 19. The ring gear member 34,<br>
and therefore the output member 19, rotates at a speed determined from the speed of the<br>
carrier member 39, the speed of the sun gear member 32 and the ring gear/sun gear tooth<br>
ratio of the planetary gear set 30. The numerical value of the fifth forward speed ratio is<br>
determined utilizing the ring gear/sun gear tooth ratios of the planetary gear sets 30, 40,<br>
50	and 60.<br>
[0059]	The sixth forward speed ratio is established with the engagement of the<br>
brake Mil and the clutch Mill. The brake Mil connects the sun gear member 42 with the transmission housing 80, and the clutch Mill connects the carrier member 39 with the sun gear member 32.

16<br>

clutch A and the clutch MIll. The clutch A connects the ring gear member 44 with the sun gear member 32 and the clutch MIll connects the carrier member 39 with the sun gear member 32.

clutch MIll and the clutch B. The clutch B connects the carrier member 69 with the sun gear member 62, and the clutch MIll connects the carrier member 39 with the sun gear member 32. The planetary gear set 60, the planetary gear set 30, the sun gear member 22 and the carrier member 29 rotate at the same speed as the input member 17. Because the carrier member 29 also rotates at the same speed as the output member 19, the input member 17 rotates at the same speed as the output member 19 in this configuration, providing a direct drive ratio.<br>
[0062]	The ninth forward speed ratio is established with the engagement of the<br>
brake C and the clutch Mill. The brake C connects the sun gear member 62 with the transmission housing 80, and the clutch Mill connects the carrier member 39 with the sun gear member 32. The carrier member 69 and the ring gear member 54 rotate at the same speed as the input member 17. The ring gear member 64, the planetary gear set 30, the sun gear member 22 and the carrier member 29 rotate at the same speed as the output member 19. The ring gear member 64, and therefore the output member 19, rotates at a speed determined from the speed of the carrier member 69 and the ring gear/sun gear<br>
17<br>
tooth ratio of the planetary gear set 60. The numerical value of the ninth forward speed<br>
ratio is determined utilizing the ring gear/sun gear tooth ratio of the planetary gear set 60.<br>
[0063]	The engagement schedule for the torque-transmitting mechanisms in the<br>
transmission 114 of Figure 2 is shown in the chart of Figure 3. Chart of Figure 3 also provides an example of torque ratios that are available utilizing the ring gear/sun gear tooth ratios as follows: the ring gear/sun gear tooth ratio of the planetary gear set 20 is 3.96; the ring gear/sun gear tooth ratio of the planetary gear set 30 is 4.65; the ring gear/sun gear tooth ratio of the planetary gear set 40 is 3.26; the ring gear/sun gear tooth ratio of the planetary gear set 50 is 3.26; and the ring gear/sun gear tooth ratio of the planetary gear set 60 is 3.57.<br>
[0064]	Also, the chart of Figure 3 describes the ratio steps that are obtained<br>
utilizing the tooth ratio values listed above. For example, the step ratio between the first and second forward torque ratio is 1.31, while the step ratio between the second and third forward torque ratio is 1.28. It is apparent from Figure 3 that the first three forward speed ratios are established with the engagement of the first mode brake MI while the input torque-transmitting mechanisms A, B and C are engaged in succeeding order. The fourth, fifth and sixth speed ratios are attained with the engagement of the second mode brake MIL The fourth forward speed ratio is a transition speed ratio in which the brake MI and the clutch MIl are engaged, while the sixth forward speed ratio is a transition ratio in which the clutch MIl and the brake MIll are engaged. The seventh, eighth and ninth forward speed ratios establish the third mode in which the clutch MIll is engaged while the input torque-transmitting mechanisms A, B and C are engaged in succeeding order. Only the ninth forward speed ratio is an overdrive ratio. Accordingly, as most of the forward speed ratios are underdrive ratios, lower internal speeds are maintained. Alternatively, the highest speed ratio could be an overdrive ratio, or two overdrive ratios could be provided, depending on engine speeds, vehicle speeds, axles available, and internal design considerations. Single transition shifts are employed in the forward speed ratios as well as the reverse speed ratios as is evident from Figure 3.<br>
18<br>
[0065]	The transmission 114 of Figure 2 is able to "lock" the output member 19<br>
by engaging the brake REV and the brake MI. If a vehicle having transmission 114 is parked on a grade, wheels interconnected with the output member 19 will transfer a gravity-induced torque to the output member 19, which may attempt to rotate the carrier member 29. If the output member 19 attempts to rotate in a clockwise direction, the carrier member 29 and the ring gear member 34, interconnected by interconnecting member 78, will attempt to also rotate in a clockwise direction. Because the ring gear member 24 is braked by brake MI, this will cause the sun gear member 22 to attempt to rotate in a clockwise direction as well. With the ring gear member 34 attempting to rotate in a clockwise direction, because the carrier member 39 is braked by brake REV, the pinion gears 37 will attempt to rotate in a clockwise direction, causing the sun gear member 32 to attempt to rotate in a counter-clockwise direction. Because the interconnecting member 79 connects the sun gear member 22 with the sun gear member 32, with the sun gear member 22 attempting to rotate in a clockwise direction, and the sun gear member 32 attempting to rotate in a counter-clockwise direction, rotation is prevented.<br>
[0066]	It is apparent from the above descriptions of the respective torque ratios<br>
listed in Figure 3 that the engagement of any of the input torque-transmitting mechanisms A, B or C affects power flow to and therefore the speed of the sun gear member 32. The power flow to the sun gear member 32 is along the interconnecting member 72 which is comparable to the torque flow path D of Figure 1. When the brake Mil is engaged, power flow from the front section 11 to the rear section 15 is affected through the interconnecting member 76 as the planetary gear set 40 is made active. Interconnecting member 76 is comparable to the power flow path E of Figure 1. With respect to the claims, carrier member 69 is the first gear member, ring gear member 64 is the second gear member and carrier member 49 is the third gear member.<br>
[0067]	Referring now to Figure 4, the ratio of the speed of the sun gear member<br>
22 to the speed of the input member 17 in the transmission 114 of Figure 2 is plotted versus torque ratio (i.e., the torque of the output member 19 with respect to the torque of the input member 17). Each of the nine forward speed ratios (corresponding to torque<br>
19<br>
ratios indicated in Figure 3) is plotted in Figure 4 as follows: point F represents the first speed ratio, point G represents the second speed ratio, point H represents the third speed ratio, point I represent the fourth speed ratio, point J represents the fifth speed ratio, point K represents the sixth speed ratio, point L represents the seventh speed ratio, point M represents the eighth speed ratio and point N represents the ninth speed ratio. Thus, points F, G and H represent the first modal speed ratios (establishing the first mode) while point I represents the first transition speed ratio, the fourth speed ratio. Point J represents a second modal speed ratio (establishing the second mode) while point K represents the second transition speed ratio, the sixth forward speed ratio. Points L, M and N represent third modal speed ratios (establishing the third mode). It is evident from the chart of Figure 4 that the ratio of the speed of the sun gear member 32 to the speed of the input member 17 increases in the first mode, reaches a maximum at the first transition speed ratio, decreases in the second mode, reaches a minimum at the second transition speed ratio and increases again during the third mode. Second Transmission Embodiment<br>
[0068]	Referring to Figure 5, another embodiment of a powertrain 200 having an<br>
engine 12, a planetary transmission 214 and a final drive mechanism 16 is depicted. A torque converter 13 with lock-up clutch 18 of Figure 2 may also be employed between the engine 12 and the input shaft 17.<br>

member 224, and a carrier member 229. A plurality of pinion gears 227 are rotatably supported on the carrier member 229 and disposed in meshing relationship with both the sun gear member 222 and the ring gear member 224. The planetary gear set 220 is referred to in the claims as the first planetary gear set.<br>

member 234, and a carrier member 239.

[0072]	The plurality of gear members 221 includes a headset comprised of gear<br>
261, gear 263 and gear 265. Gear 263 is connected for common rotation with the input shaft 17. Gear 261 intermeshes with gear 263 and is connected for common rotation with a countershaft 270. Gear 265 intermeshes with gear 263 and is connected for common rotation with a countershaft 272. Gear 263 is referred to in the claims as the first gear member of the plurality of gear members 221. The plurality of gear members 221 further includes gear 266 which rotates about countershaft 270 on sleeve shaft 268. Gear 266 intermeshes with gear 267 which is connected for common rotation with interconnecting member or shaft 274. Connecting shaft 274 may be one component or separate components and also interconnects with sun gear members 222 and 232. The plurality of gear members 221 also includes gear 251 which is connected for common rotation with connecting shaft 274. The plurality of gear members 221 further includes gear 253 which is connected for common rotation with sleeve shaft 255 and rotates about countershaft 272. Furthermore, the plurality of gear members 221 includes gears 241 and 243. Gear 241 is connected for common rotation with the countershaft 270 and intermeshes with gear 243 which is connected for common rotation with sleeve shaft 245. Sleeve shaft 245 rotates about and is concentric with the connecting shaft 274.<br>
[0073]	The input shaft 17 is continuously connected with the gear 263. The<br>
output shaft 19 is continuously connected with the carrier member 229. The interconnecting member 278 continuously connects the ring gear member 234 with the carrier member 229. The connecting shaft 274 continuously connects the sun gear members 222 and 232. Gear 261 is continuously connected with gear 241 via the countershaft 270. Gear 267 is continuously connected with gear 251 via the connecting shaft 274. Gear 266 is intermeshed with gear 267, gear 241 is intermeshed with gear 243, and gear 253 is intermeshed with gear 251.<br>
21<br>
[0074]	Gear 265 is selectively connectable with gear 253 by the engagement of<br>
the clutch A which interconnects the countershaft 272 with the sleeve shaft 255. The input member 17 is selectively connectable with the connecting shaft 274 via engagement of the clutch B. Gear 261 is selectively connectable with gear 266 via engagement of clutch C which interconnects the countershaft 270 with the sleeve shaft 268. Ring gear member 224 is selectively connectable with the transmission housing 280 via engagement of the brake MI. Gear 243 is selectively connectable with the carrier member 239 via engagement of the clutch MIL The sun gear member 222 is selectively connectable with carrier member 229 via engagement of the clutch Mill which also interconnects the sun gear member 222 with the output member 19. The carrier member 239 is selectively connectable with the transmission housing 280 via engagement of the brake REV.<br>
[0075]	As shown in the chart of Figure 6, the torque-transmitting mechanisms of<br>
Figure 5 (i.e., clutches A, B, C, clutch MIl, clutch MIll and brakes MI and REV) are selectively engaged in combinations of two to provide nine forward speed ratios and three reverse speed ratios (corresponding torque ratios are listed). The engagement schedule for torque-transmitting mechanisms of Figure 5 is shown in the chart of Figure 6. Figure 6 also provides an example of torque ratios that are available using the follow gear tooth counts and ring gear/sun gear tooth ratios in Figure 5: gears 261, 263 and 265 each have 100 teeth, gear 266 has 112 teeth, gear 267 has 88 teeth, gear 251 has 113 teeth, gear 253 has 87 teeth, gear 241 has 74 teeth, gear 243 has 126 teeth; the planetary gear set 220 has a ring gear/sun gear tooth ratio of 3.96, and the planetary gear set 230 has a ring gear/sun gear tooth ratio of 4.84.<br>
[0076]	The first three forward speed ratios of Figure 5 are first modal speed ratios<br>
(because the brake MI is engaged with the input torque-transmitting mechanisms A, B and C) establishing a first mode. The fourth forward speed ratio is a first transition speed ratio (corresponding with the torque ratio of 2.86). The fifth forward speed ratio is a second modal speed ratio (because the clutch MIl is engaged with clutch C) establishing a second mode. The sixth forward speed ratio is a second transition speed ratio (corresponding with the torque ratio of 1.70). The seventh, eighth and ninth forward<br>
22<br>
speed ratios are third modal speed ratios (because the clutch MIll is engaged with the input torque-transmitting mechanisms A, B and C) establishing a third mode. The first through seventh forward speed ratios are underdrive ratios, the eighth forward speed ratio is a direct drive ratio and the ninth forward speed is an overdrive speed ratio, as determined by the gear ratio selections of each component. Each of the forward speed ratios as well as the three reverse speed ratios involve single transition shifts, are characterized by close ratio steps (listed in Figure 6) and the first forward speed ratio as well as the first reverse speed ratio (Rl) are deep start ratios.<br>
[0077]	The transmission 214 of Figure 5 provides a locked output feature by<br>
engaging both the brake REV and the brake MI simultaneously while on an incline. As the output shaft 19 attempts to rotate in one direction (for instance, clockwise) the carrier member 229 as well as the ring gear member 234 will also attempt to rotate clockwise. This will force the sun gear member 222 to attempt to rotate clockwise while the sun gear member 232 attempts to rotate counter-clockwise, thus effectively preventing rotation of the output shaft 19.<br>
[0078]	With respect to the claims, the gear 263 is the first gear member of the<br>
plurality of gear members, gear 251 is the second gear member of the plurality of gear members and gear 243 is the third gear member of the plurality of gear members. Accordingly, the speed of the sun gear member 232 increases during the first mode, decreases during the second mode and increases again during the third mode. The connecting shaft 274 is comparable to power flow path D, and the sleeve shaft 245 and gear 243 is comparable to power flow path E.<br>
[0079]	As shown and described above for the transmission of Figure 2, those<br>
skilled in the art will understand from the chart of Figure 6 how the torque ratios shown are established through the planetary gear sets 220 and 230 as well as the plurality of gear members 221.<br>

[00127]	The planetary gear set 760 includes a sun gear member 762, a ring gear<br>
member 764 and a carrier member 769. A plurality of pinion gears 767 are rotatably supported on the carrier member 769 and disposed in meshing relationship with both the sun gear member 762 and the ring gear member 764.<br>
[00128]	The input shaft 17 is continuously connected with the carrier member 769<br>
and therefore also with the ring gear member 754 via the interconnecting member 770. The output shaft 19 is continuously connected with the carrier member 729 and therefore also with the carrier member 739 via the interconnecting member 768 which interconnects carrier member 739 with carrier member 729. Ring gear member 764 is continuously connected with the sun gear member 722 via the interconnecting member<br><br>
36<br>
772 which may be one component or several components. The carrier member 759 is continuously connected with the ring gear member 744 via interconnecting member 774. Carrier member 749 is continuously connected with the ring gear member 734 via the interconnecting member 776 which may be one component or several components. Sun gear member 732 is continuously connected with the ring gear member 724 via the interconnecting member 769. The planetary gear sets 740, 750 and 760 are referred to as a plurality of gear members within the claims.<br>
[00129]	With respect to the claims, the first gear member of the plurality of gear<br>
members is carrier member 769, the second gear member of the plurality of gear members is ring gear member 764, and the third gear member of the plurality of gear members is carrier member 749.<br>
[00130]	The ring gear member 764 is selectively connectable with the carrier<br>
member 759 and the ring gear member 744 via the clutch A. The carrier member 769 is selectively connectable with the sun gear member 762 via engagement of the clutch B. The sun gear member 762 is selectively connectable with the transmission housing 780 via engagement of the brake C. The ring gear member 724, as well as the sun gear member 732 via the interconnecting member 769, is selectively connectable with the transmission housing 780 via engagement of the brake MI. The sun gear member 742 is selectively connectable to the transmission housing 780 via engagement of the brake MIL The sun gear member 722 is selectively connectable with the carrier member 729 and therefore with the output member 19 via engagement of the clutch Mill. The ring gear member 734 is also selectively connectable to the transmission housing 780 via the brake REV.<br>
[00131]	Referring to the chart of Figure 16, the engagement schedule provided for<br>
the torque-transmitting mechanisms of the transmission 714 of Figure 15 achieves nine forward speed ratios and three reverse speed ratios. Torque ratios as well as ratio steps associated with the speed ratios are listed. Speed ratios corresponding with the torque ratios are indicated by numbers 1-9, R3, R2, and Rl. The first, second and third forward speed ratios are first modal speed ratios (because brake MI is engaged with the input torque-transmitting mechanisms A, B and C) establishing a first mode. The fourth<br><br>
37<br>
forward speed ratio establishes a first transition speed ratio. The fifth forward speed ratio<br>
is the second modal speed ratio (because brake MIl is engaged with clutch C) to establish<br>
a second mode. The sixth forward speed ratio is the second transition speed ratio. The<br>
seventh, eighth and ninth forward speed ratios are the third modal speed ratios (because<br>
clutch MIll is engaged with the input torque-transmitting mechanisms A, B and C) to<br>
establish a third mode. The engagement schedule depicted in Figure 16 involves single<br>
transition shifts. Additionally, the first forward speed ratio as well as the reverse speed<br>
ratio Rl provide deep start ratios. The transmission 714 is designed to provide the close<br>
ratio steps listed in Figure 16. Listed torque ratios and ratio steps result from the<br>
following ring gear/sun gear tooth ratios of the planetary transmission 714 of Figure 15:<br>
the ring gear/sun gear tooth ratio of the planetary gear set 720 is 3.96; the ring gear/sun<br>
gear tooth ratio of the planetary gear set 730 is 1.52; the ring gear/sun gear tooth ratio of<br>
the planetary gear set 740 is 3.26; the ring gear/sun gear tooth ratio of the planetary gear<br>
set 750 is 3.26; and the ring gear/sun gear tooth ratio of the planetary gear set 760 is 2.88.<br>
[00132]	Application of the brake REV and the brake MI provides a lockout feature<br>
to prevent rotation of the output member 19 on steep grades. Application of brake MI and brake REV ground both the ring gear member 734 and the sun gear member 732 of the planetary gear set 730 to the transmission housing 780. This causes the entire planetary gear set 720 and planetary gear set 730 to be grounded. Eighth Transmission Embodiment<br>

[00140]	The input shaft 17 is continuously connected with the carrier member 869<br>
(and therefore also with the ring gear member 854 via the interconnecting member 870<br>
which connects the carrier member 869 and the ring gear member 854). The output shaft<br>
19 is continuously connected with the carrier member 829. The ring gear member 864 is<br>

[00141]	With respect to the claims, the first gear member of the plurality of gear<br>
members is the carrier member 869, the second gear member of the plurality of gear members is the ring gear member 864, and the third gear member of the plurality of gear members is the carrier member 849.<br>

[00143]	Referring to the chart of Figure 18, the engagement schedule for the<br>
torque-transmitting mechanisms of the transmission 814 of Figure 17 to achieve nine forward speed ratios and three reverse speed ratios is provided. Torque ratios as well as ratio steps associated with the speed ratios are listed. Speed ratios corresponding with the torque ratios are indicated by the numbers 1-9, R3, R2, and Rl. The first, second and<br><br>
40<br>
third forward speed ratios are first modal speed ratios (because the brake MI is engaged<br>
with the input torque-transmitting mechanisms A, B and C) to establish a first mode. The<br>
fourth forward speed ratio is a first transition speed ratio. The fifth forward speed ratio is<br>
a second modal speed ratio because brake MIl is engaged with brake C thereby<br>
establishing a second mode. The sixth forward speed ratio is a second transition speed<br>
ratio. The seven, eighth and ninth forward speed ratios are third modal speed ratios<br>
(because the clutch MIll is engaged with the input torque-transmitting mechanisms A, B<br>
and C) to establish the third mode. The engagement schedule depicted in Figure 18<br>
involves single transition shifts. Additionally, the first forward ratio as well as the first<br>
reverse speed ratio provide a deep start ratio. Transmission 814 is designed to provide<br>
the close ratio steps listed in Figure 18. The listed torque ratios and ratio steps result<br>
from the following ring gear/sun gear tooth ratio of the transmission 814 of Figure 17:<br>
the ring gear/sun gear tooth ratio of the planetary gear set 820 is 1.46; the ring gear/sun<br>
gear tooth ratio of the planetary gear set 830 is 2.06; the ring gear/sun gear tooth ratio of<br>
the planetary gear set 840 is 3.26; the ring gear/sun gear tooth ratio of the planetary gear<br>
set 850 is 3.26; and the ring gear/sun gear tooth ratio of the planetary gear set 860 is 3.26.<br>
[00144]	In the transmission 814 of Figure 17, application of the brake REV and the<br>
brake MI provides a lockout feature to prevent rotation of the output member 19 on steep grades. Application of the brake MI prevents rotation of the ring gear member 834 and the sun gear member 822. Application of the brake REV grounds the carrier member 839, the ring gear member 834 and the carrier member 849 to the transmission housing 880. Because two members of planetary gear set 830 are held stationary, and these members interconnect with two different member of the planetary gear set 820, the entire planetary gear set 820 and the entire planetary gear set 830 are held stationary. Thus, when both the brake MI and REV are applied, the entire planetary gear sets 820 and 830 are held stationary, which prevents rotation of the output member 19.<br><br>

Fourth Output Section Embodiment (Ninth Transmission Embodiment)<br>
[00146]	Referring to Figure 19, another embodiment of an output or rear section<br>
15 of a transmission within the scope of the invention is depicted. The rear section 15 includes a first planetary gear set 920 and a second planetary gear set 930. The first planetary gear set 920 includes a sun gear member 922, ring gear member 924 and a carrier member 929 that rotatably supports a plurality of pinion gear members 927 that are disposed in meshing engagement with both the sun gear member 922 and the ring gear member 924.<br>
[00147]	The planetary gear set 930 includes a sun gear member 932, a ring gear<br>
member 934 and a carrier member 939 that rotatably supports a plurality of pinion gears 937 that are disposed in meshing relationship with both the sun gear member 932 and the ring gear member 934.<br>
[00148]	The carrier member 929 is continuously connected with the output<br>
member 19 which is continuously connected with the final drive mechanism 16. The sun gear member 932 is continuously connected with the sun gear member 922 via the interconnecting member 972. The carrier member 939 is continuously connected with the ring gear member 924 via the interconnecting member 978. Various input torque-transmitting mechanisms including clutches A, B and C in any of the input sections 11 of embodiments described herein are selectively engagable to provide power flow at the ring gear member 934. Power flow to the ring gear member 934 is along path D of Figure 1. Similarly, a second modal torque-transmitting mechanism, clutch Mil in any of the input sections 11 of the embodiments described herein is selectively engagable to provide power flow to the carrier member 939 and also to the ring gear member 924 via the interconnecting member 978. Power flow to the carrier member 939 is along path E of<br><br>
42<br>
Figure 1. A first modal torque-transmitting mechanism, the brake MI, is selectively<br>
engagable to connect the sun gear members 922 and 932 to the transmission housing 980.<br>
A third modal torque-transmitting mechanism, clutch Mill, is selectively engagable to<br>
connect the carrier member 929 with the ring gear member 924. A brake REV is<br>
selectively engagable to connect carrier member 939 with the transmission housing 980.<br>
[00149]	Application of both the brake MI and the brake REV provides a lockout<br>
feature to prevent the output member 19 from rotating on steep grades. By holding the sun gear member 922 stationary via application of the brake MI and by holding the ring gear member 924 stationary via application of the brake REV, the entire planetary gear set 920 is held stationary including the carrier member 929, thereby holding the output member 19 stationary as well.<br>
Fifth Output Section Embodiment (Tenth Transmission Embodiment)<br>
[00150]	Referring to Figure 19, another embodiment of an output or rear section<br>
15 for a transmission within the scope of the invention is illustrated. The rear section 15 includes both a first planetary gear set 1020 and a second planetary gear set 1030. The first planetary gear set 1020 includes a sun gear member 1022, a ring gear member 1024 and a carrier member 1029 rotatably supporting a plurality of pinion gear members 1027 disposed in meshing relationship with both sun gear member 1022 and ring gear member 1024.<br>
[00151]	The planetary gear set 1030 includes sun gear member 1032, a ring gear<br>
member 1034, and a carrier member 1039 rotatably supporting a plurality of pinion gears 1037 disposed in meshing relationship with both the sun gear member 1032 and the ring gear member 1034.<br>
[00152]	The carrier member 1029 is continuously connected with the output<br>
member 19 which is continuously connected with the final drive mechanism 16. The sun gear member 1022 is continuously connected with the sun gear member 1032 via the interconnecting member 1072. The ring gear member 1024 is continuously connected with the ring gear member 1034 via an interconnecting member 1078. Input torque-transmitting mechanisms A, B and C (or at least two thereof) in any of the input sections 11 of embodiments described herein are selectively engagable to establish power flow at<br><br>
43<br>
the sun gear member 1032 (and therefore the sun gear member 1022 via the<br>
interconnecting member 1072). Power flow to the sun gear member 1032 is along path D<br>
of Figure 1. A second modal torque-transmitting mechanism, clutch Mil in any of the<br>
input sections 11 of the embodiments described herein, is selectively engagable to<br>
establish power flow at the carrier member 1039. Power flow to the carrier member 1039<br>
is along path E of Figure 1. A first modal torque-transmitting mechanism, the brake MI<br>
is selectively engagable to connect the ring gear members 1024 and 1034 with a<br>
transmission housing 1080. A third modal torque-transmitting mechanism Mill is<br>
selectively engagable to connect the carrier member 1029 with the sun gear member<br>
1022. Engagement of both the brake MI and reverse brake REV prevents rotation of the<br>
output member 19 to provide a lockout feature on steep grades. The brake MI prevents<br>
rotation of both of the ring gear members 1024 and 1034. The brake REV prevents<br>
rotation of the carrier member 1039. Because neither the ring gear member 1034 nor the<br>
carrier member 1039 rotate, the sun gear member 1032 is also held stationary. The<br>
interconnecting member 1072 thus ensures that the sun gear member 1022 is held<br>
stationary. Because both the sun gear member 1022 and the ring gear member 1024 are<br>
stationary, the carrier member 1029, and therefore the output member 19 are stationary.<br>
Sixth Output Section Embodiment (Eleventh Transmission Embodiment)<br>
[00153]	Referring to Figure 21, another embodiment of an output or rear section<br>
15 for a transmission within the scope of the invention is illustrated. The rear section 15 includes both a first planetary gear set 1120 and a second planetary gear set 1130. The first planetary gear set 1120 includes a sun gear member 1122, a ring gear member 1124 and a carrier member 1129 rotatably supporting a plurality of pinion gear members 1127 disposed in meshing relationship with both sun gear member 1122 and ring gear member 1124.<br>
[00154]	The planetary gear set 1130 includes sun gear member 1132, a ring gear<br>
member 1134, and a carrier member 1139 rotatably supporting a plurality of pinion gears 1137 disposed in meshing relationship with both the sun gear member 1132 and the ring gear member 1134.<br><br>
44<br>
[00155]	The ring gear member 1124 is continuously connected with the output<br>
member 19 which is continuously connected with the final drive mechanism 16. The carrier member 1139 is continuously connected with the carrier member 1129 via the interconnecting member 1172. The sun gear member 1122 is continuously connected with the sun gear member 1132 via an interconnecting member 1178. Input torque-transmitting mechanism B in any of the input sections 11 of embodiments discussed herein is selectively engagable to establish power flow at the carrier member 1129 (and therefore the carrier member 1139 via the interconnecting member 1172). Input torque-transmitting mechanism C in any of the input sections 11 of embodiments discussed herein is selectively engagable to establish power flow at the sun gear member 1132 (and therefore the sun gear member 1122 via the interconnecting member 1178). Power flow to the carrier member 1129 or to the sun gear member 1132 is along the path D of Figure 1. A second modal torque-transmitting mechanism, Mil in any of the input sections 11 of the embodiments discussed herein, is selectively engagable to establish power flow at the carrier member 1139. Power flow to the carrier member 1139 is along path E of Figure 1. A first modal torque-transmitting mechanism, the brake MI is selectively engagable to connect the ring gear member 1134 with a transmission housing 1180. A third modal torque-transmitting mechanism Mill is selectively engagable to connect the carrier member 1129 with the ring gear member 1124. Engagement of both the brake MI and reverse brake REV prevents rotation of the output member 19 to provide a lockout feature on steep grades. The brake MI prevents rotation of ring gear members 1134. The brake REV prevents rotation of the carrier member 1139. Because neither the ring gear member 1134 nor the carrier member 1139 rotate, the sun gear member 1132 is also held stationary. The interconnecting members 1172 and 1178 thus ensure that the sun gear member 1122 and the carrier member 1129 are held stationary. Because both the sun gear member 1122 and the carrier member 1129 are stationary, the ring gear member 1124, and therefore the output member 19 are stationary.<br><br>

Seventh Output Section Embodiment (Twelfth Transmission Embodiment)<br>
(00156)	Referring to Figure 22, another embodiment of an output or rear section<br>
15 for a transmission within the scope of the invention is illustrated. The rear section 15 includes both a first planetary gear set 1220 and a second planetary gear set 1230. The first planetary gear set 1220 includes a sun gear member 1222, a ring gear member 1224 and a carrier member 1229 rotatably supporting a plurality of pinion gear members 1227 disposed in meshing relationship with both sun gear member 1222 and ring gear member 1224.<br>
[00157]	The planetary gear set 1230 includes sun gear member 1232, a ring gear<br>
member 1234, and a carrier member 1239 rotatably supporting a plurality of pinion gears 1237 disposed in meshing relationship with both the sun gear member 1232 and the ring gear member 1234.<br>
[00158]	The ring gear member 1224 is continuously connected with the output<br>
member 19 which is continuously connected with the final drive mechanism 16. The ring gear member 1234 is continuously connected with the carrier member 1229 via the interconnecting member 1272. The carrier member 1239 is continuously connected with the ring gear member 1224 via an interconnecting member 1278. Input torque-transmitting mechanism B in any of the input sections 11 of embodiments described herein is selectively engagable to establish power flow at the carrier member 1229 (and therefore the ring gear member 1234 via the interconnecting member 1272). Input torque-transmitting mechanism C in any of the input sections 11 of embodiments discussed herein is selectively engagable to establish power flow at the sun gear member 1222. Power flow to the carrier member 1229 or to the sun gear member 1222 is along path D of Figure 1. A second modal torque-transmitting mechanism, Mil is in any of the input sections 11 of the embodiments described herein, is selectively engagable to establish power flow at the carrier member 1229 and therefore the ring gear member 1234 via the interconnecting member 1272. Power flow from the Mil input to the carrier member 1229 is along path E of Figure 1. A first modal torque-transmitting mechanism, the brake MI is selectively engagable to connect the sun gear member 1232 with a transmission housing 1280. A third modal torque-transmitting mechanism Mill is<br><br>
46<br>
selectively engagable to connect the carrier member 1229 with the ring gear member<br>
1224. Engagement of both the brake MI and reverse brake REV prevents rotation of the<br>
output member 19 to provide a lockout feature on steep grades. The brake MI prevents<br>
rotation of the sun gear member 1232. The brake REV prevents rotation of both the<br>
carrier member 1229 and the ring gear members 1234 and 1224. Therefore, the output<br>
member 19 is stationary.<br>

[00159]	Figure 23 shows a powertrain 1300 having an engine 12, a transmission<br>
1314 and a final drive mechanism 16. The transmission 1314 may be characterized by a<br>

drive mechanism 16. The transmission 1314 includes four planetary gear sets 1320,<br>
1330, 1340, and 1350. The planetary gear sets 1340 and 1350 partially define the front<br>
section 11 and the planetary gear sets 1320 and 1330 partially define the rear section 15.<br>

member 1354 and a carrier member 1359. A plurality of pinion gears 1357 are rotatably supported on the carrier member 1359 and disposed in meshing relationship with both the sun gear member 1352 and the ring gear member 1354.<br>
[00165]	The input shaft 17 is continuously connected with the ring gear member<br>
1354. The output shaft 19 is continuously connected with the carrier member 1329 and therefore also with the ring gear member 1334 via the interconnecting member 1378. The carrier member 1359 is continuously connected with the ring gear member 1344 via the interconnecting member 1370. The sun gear 1352 is continuously connected to the housing 1380. The carrier member 1349 is continuously connected with the carrier member 1339 via the interconnecting member 1376.

[00166]	With respect to the claims, the first gear member of the plurality of gear<br><br>
members is the ring gear member 1354, the second gear member of the plurality of gear members is the carrier member 1349, and the third gear member of the plurality of gear members is the ring gear member 1344.<br>
[00167]	The carrier member 1359 and the ring gear member 1344 are selectively<br>

[00168]	Referring to the chart of Figure 24, the engagement schedule for the<br>
torque-transmitting mechanisms of the transmission 1314 of Figure 23 to achieve seven forward speed ratios and two reverse speed ratios is provided. Torque ratios as well as ratio steps associated with the speed ratios are listed. Speed ratios are indicated by the numbers 1-7, R2 and Rl. Tjhe first and second forward speed ratios are first modal speed ratios (because the brake MI is engaged with the input torque-transmitting mechanisms B and C, respectively) to establish a first mode. The third forward speed ratio is a first transition speed ratio. The fourth forward speed ratio is a second modal speed ratio because brake MIl is engaged with clutch C thereby establishing a second mode. The fifth forward speed ratio is a second transition speed ratio. The sixth and seventh forward speed ratios are third modal speed ratios (because the clutch MIll is engaged with the input torque-transmitting mechanisms B and C, respectively) to establish the third mode. The engagement schedule depicted in Figure 23 involves single transition shifts. Additionally, the first forward ratio as well as the first reverse speed ratio provide a deep start ratio. Also, the highest speed ratio (indicated at 7 in the chart of Figure 24) is a direct ratio. Thus, seven forward speed ratios are provided with low internal speeds, as there are no overdrive ratios. Transmission 1314 is designed to provide the close ratio steps listed in Figure 24. The listed torque ratios and ratio steps result from the following ring gear/sun gear tooth ratio of the transmission 1314 of Figure 23: the ring gear/sun gear tooth ratio of the planetary gear set 1320 is 3.0; the ring gear/sun gear tooth ratio of the planetary gear set 1330 is 3.8; the ring gear/sun gear tooth ratio of the planetary gear set 1340 is 2.88; and the ring gear/sun gear tooth ratio of the planetary gear set 1350 is 2.88.<br><br>
49<br>
[00169]	In the transmission 1314 of Figure 23, application of the brake REV and<br>
the brake MI provides a lockout feature to prevent rotation of the output member 19 on<br>
steep grades. The lockout feature functions in the same manner as that described with<br>
respect to the lockout feature of Figure 2<br>
