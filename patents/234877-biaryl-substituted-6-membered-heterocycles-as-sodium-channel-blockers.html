				<td>TITLE OF THE INVENTION<br>
BIARYL SUBSTITUTED 6-MEMBERED HETEROCYLES AS SODIUM CHANNEL<br>
BLOCKERS<br>
FIELD OF THE. INVENTION<br>
The present invention is directed to a series of biaryl substituted 6-membered heterocyclic compounds. In particular, this invention is directed to biaryl substituted 6-membered pyridine, pyrimidine and pyrazine compounds that are sodium channel blockers useful for the treatment of chronic and neuropathic pain. The compounds of the present invention are also useful for the treatment of other conditions, including, for example, central nervous system (CNS) disorders such as epilepsy, manic depression, bipolar disorder, anxiety, depression and diabetic neuropathy.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Voltage-gated ion channels allow electrically excitable cells to generate and propagate action potentials and therefore are crucial for nerve and muscle function. Sodium channels play a special role by mediating rapid depolarization, which constitutes the rising phase of the action potential and in turn activates voltage-gated calcium and potassium channels. Voltage-gated sodium channels represent a multigene family. Nine sodium channel subtypes have been cloned and functionally expressed to date. [Clare, J. J., Tate, S. N., Nobbs, M. &amp; Romanes, M. A. Voltage-gated sodium channels as therapeutic targets. Drug Discovery Today 5, 506-520 (2000)]. They are differentially expressed throughout muscle and nerve tissues and show distinct biophysical properties. All voltage-gated sodium channels are characterized by a high degree of selectivity for sodium over other ions and by their voltage-dependent gating. [Catterall, W. A. Structure and function of voltage-gated sodium and calcium channels. Current Opinion in NeuroUology 1,5-13 (1991)]. At negative or hyperpolarized membrane potentials, sodium channels are closed. Following membrane depolarization, sodium channels open rapidly and then inactivate.. Sodium channels only conduct currents in the open state and, once inactivated, have to return to the resting state, favored by membrane hyperpolarization, before they can reopen. Different sodium channel subtypes vary in the voltage range over which they activate and inactivate as well as in their activation and inactivation kinetics.<br>
Sodium channels are the target of a diverse array of pharmacological agents, including neurotoxins, antiarrhythmics, anticonvulsants and local anesthetics. [Clare, J. J., Tate, S. N., Nobbs, M. &amp; Romanes, M. A. Voltage-gated sodium channels as therapeutic targets. Drug<br>
Discovery Today 5, 506-520 (2000)]. Several regions in the sodium channel secondary structure are involved in interactions with these blockers and most are highly conserved. Indeed, most sodium channel blockers known to date interact with similar potency with all channel subtypes. Nevertheless, it has been possible to produce sodium channel blockers with therapeutic selectivity and a sufficient therapeutic window for the treatment of epilepsy (e.g. lamotrigine, phenytoin and carbamazepine) and certain cardiac arrhythmias (e.g. lignocaine, tocainide and mexiletine).<br>
It is well known that.the voltage-gated Na+ channels in nerves play a critical role in neuropathic pain. Injuries of the peripheral nervous system often result in neuropathic pain persisting long after the initial injury resolves. Examples of neuropathic pain include, but are not limited to, postherpetic neuralgia, trigeminal neuralgia, diabetic neuropathy, chronic lower back pain, phantom limb pain, pain resulting from cancer and chemotherapy, chronic pelvic pain, complex regional pain syndrome and related neuralgias.   It has been shown in human patients as well as in animal models of neuropathic pain, that damage to primary afferent sensory neurons can lead to neuroma formation and spontaneous activity, as well as evoked activity in response to normally innocuous stimuli. [Carter, G.T. and B.S. Galer, Advances in the management of neuropathic pain. Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Clinics of North America, 2001.12(2): p. 447-459], The ectopic activity of normally silent sensory neurons is thought to contribute to the generation and; maintenance of neuropathic pain. Neuropathic pain is generally assumed to be associated with an increase in sodium channel activity in the injured nerve. [Baker, M.D. and J.N. Wood, Involvement of Na channels in pain pathways. TRENDS in Pharmacological Sciences, 2001. 22(1): p. 27-31].<br>
Indeed, in rat models of peripheral nerve injury, ectopic activity in the injured nerve corresponds to the behavioral signs of pain. In these models, intravenous application of the sodium channel blocker and local anesthetic lidocaine can suppress the ectopic activity and reverse the tactile allodynia at concentrations that do not affect general behavior and motor function. [ Mao, J, and L.L. Chen, Systemic lidocaine for neuropathic pain relief. Pain, 2000. 87: p. 7-17]. These effective concentrations were similar to concentrations shown to be clinically efficacious in humans. [Tanelian, D.L. and W.G. Brose, Neuropathic pain can be relieved by drugs that are use-dependent sodium channel blockers: lidocaine, carbamazepine and mexiletine. Anesthesiology, 1991. 74(5): p. 949-951]. In a placebo-controlled study, continuous infusion of lidocaine caused reduced pain scores in patients with peripheral nerve injury, and in a separate study, intravenous lidocaine reduced pain intensity associated with postherpetic neuralgia (PHN). ( Mao, J. and L.L. Chen, Systemic lidocaine for neuropathic pain relief. Pain,<br>
2000. 87: p. 7-17. Anger, T., et al., Medicinal chemistry ofneuronal voltage-gated sodium channel blockers. Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, 2001. 44(2): p. 115-137]. Lidoderm®, lidocaine applied in the form of a dermal patch, is currently the only FDA approved treatment for PHN. [Devers, A. and B.S. Galer, Topical lidocaine patch relieves a variety of neuropathic pain conditions: an open-label study. Clinical Journal of Pain, 2000. 16(3): p. 205-208].<br>
In addition to neuropathic pain, sodium channel blockers have clinical uses in the treatment of epilepsy and cardiac arrhythmias. Recent evidence from animal models suggests that sodium channel blockers may also be useful for neuroprotection under ischaemic conditions caused by stroke or neural trauma and in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). [Clare, J. J. et. al. And Anger, T. et. al.].<br>
International Patent Publication WO 00/57877 describes aryl substituted pyrazoles, imidazoles, oxazoles, thiazoles, and pyrroles and their uses as sodium channel blockers. International Patent Publication WO 01/68612 describes aryl substituted pyridines, pyrimidines, pyrarines and triazines and their uses as sodium channel blockers. International Patent Publication WO 99/32462 describes triazine compounds for the treatment for CNS disorders. However, there remains a need for novel compounds and compositions that therapeutically block neuronal sodium channels with less side effects and higher potency than currently known compounds.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is directed to biaryl substituted 6-membered pyridine, pyrimidine and pyrazine compounds which are sodium channel blockers useful for the treatment of chronic and neuropathic pain. The compounds of the present invention are also useful for the treatment of other conditions, including CNS disorders such as anxiety, depression, epilepsy, manic depression and bipolar disorder. This invention provides pharmaceutical compositions comprising a compound of the present invention, either alone, or in combination with one or more therapeutically active compounds, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.<br>
This invention further comprises methods for the treatment of conditions associated with, or resulting from, sodium channel activity, such as acute pain, chronic pain, visceral pain, inflammatory pain, neuropathic pain and disorders of the CNS including, but not limited to, anxiety, depression, epilepsy, manic depression and bipolar disorder.<br>

The following in vitro and in vivo assays were used in assessing the biological activity of the instant compounds.<br>
Compound Evaluation (in vitro assay):<br>
The identification of inhibitors of the sodium channel is based on the ability of sodium channels to cause cell depolarization when sodium ions permeate through agonist-modified channels. In the absence of inhibitors, exposure of an agonist-modified channel to sodium ions will cause cell depolarization. Sodium channel inhibitors will prevent cell depolarization caused by sodium ion movement through agonist-modified sodium channels. Changes in membrane potential can be determined with voltage-sensitive fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) dye pairs that use two components, a donor coumarin (CC2DMPE) and an acceptor oxanol (DiSBAC2(3)). Oxanol is a lipophilic anion and distributes across the<br>
membrane according to membrane potential.  In the presence of a sodium channel agonist, but in the absence of sodium, the inside of the cell is negative with respect to the outside, oxanol is accumulated at the outer leaflet of the membrane and excitation of coumarin will cause FRET to occur. Addition of sodium will cause membrane depolarization leading to redistribution of oxanol to the inside of the cell, and, as a consequence, to a decrease in FRET. Thus, the ratio change (donor/acceptor) increases after membrane depolarization. In the presence of a sodium channel inhibitor, cell depolarization will not occur, and therefore the distribution of oxanol and FRET will remain unchanged.<br>
Cells stably transfected with the PN1 sodium channel (HEK-PN1) were grown in polyiysine-coated 96-well plates at a density of ca. 140,000 cells/well. The media was aspirated, and the cells were washed with PBS buffer, and incubated with lOOµL of lOµM CC2-DMPE in 0.02% pluronic acid. After incubation at 25°C for 45min, media was removed and cells were washed 2x with buffer. Cells were incubated with lOOuL of DiSBAC2(3) in TMA buffer containing 20uM veratridine, 20nM brevetoxin-3, and test sample. After incubation at 25°C for 45min in the dark, plates were placed in the VIPR instrument, and the fluorescence emission of both CC2-DMPE and DiSB AC2(3) recorded for 10s. At this point, lOOuL of saline buffer was added to the wells to determine the extent of sodium-dependent cell depolarization, and the fluorescence emission of both dyes recorded for an additional 20s. The ratio CC2-DMPE/DiSBAC2(3)r before addition of saline buffer equals 1. In the absence of inhibitors, the ratio after addition of saline buffer is &gt; 1.5. When the sodium channel has been completely inhibited by either a known standard or test compound, this ratio remains at 1. It is possible, therefore, to titrate the activity of a sodium channel inhibitor by monitoring the concentration-dependent change in fluorescence ratio.<br>
Electrophysiologicai Assays (In Vitro assays):<br>
Cell preparation: A HEK-293 cell line stably expressing the PN1 sodium channel subtype was established in-house. The cells were cultured in MEM growth media (Gibco) with 0.5mg/mL G418, 50 urats/mL Pen/Strep and ImL heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum at 37°C and 10% CO2. For electrophysiological recordings, cells were plated on 35mm dishes coated with poly-D-lysine.<br>
Whole-cell recordings: HEK-293 cells stably expressing the PN1 sodium channel subtype were examined by whole cell voltage clamp (Hamill et. al. Pfluegers Archives 391:85-100 (1981)) using an EPC-9 amplifier and Pulse software (HEKA Electronics, Lamprecht, Germany). Experiments were performed at room temperature. Electrodes were fire-polished to<br>
resistances of 2-4 M£l Voltage errors were minimized by series resistance compensation, and the capacitance artifact was canceled using the EPC-9's built-in circuitry. Data were acquired at 50 kHz and filtered at 7-10 kHz. The bath solution consisted of 40 mM NaCl, 120 mM NMDG Cl, 1 mM KC1, 2.7 mM CaCl2, 0.5 mM MgCl2,10 mM NMDG HEPES, pH 7.4, and the internal (pipet) solution contained 110 mM Cs-methanesulfonate, 5 mM NaCl, 20mM CsCl, l0mM CsF, 10 mM BAPTA (terra Cs salt), 10 mM Cs HEPES, pH 7.4.<br>
The following protocols were used to estimate the steady-state affinity of compounds for the resting and inactivated state of the channel (Kr and K;, respectively):<br>
1)	8ms test-pulses to depolarizing voltages from -60mV to +50mV from a<br>
holding potential of -90mV were used to construct current-voltage relationships (TV-curves). A<br>
voltage near the peak of the TV-curve (typically -10 or 0 mV) was used as the test-pulse voltage<br>
throughout the remainder of the experiment.<br>
2)	Steady-state inactivation (availability) curves were constructed by measuring<br>
the current activated during an 8ms test-pulse following 10s conditioning pulses to potentials<br>
ranging from -120mV to -l0mV.<br>
3)	Compounds were applied at a holding potential at which 20-50% of the<br>
channels was inactivated and sodium channel blockage was monitored during 8ms test pulses at<br>
2s intervals.<br>
4)	After the compounds equilibrated, the voltage-dependence of steady-state<br>
inactivation in the presence of compound was determined according to protocol 2) above.<br>
Compounds that block the resting state of the channel decrease the current elicited during test-<br>
pulses from all holding potentials, whereas compounds that primarily block the inactivated state<br>
shift the mid-point of the steady-state inactivation curve. The maximum current at negative<br>
holding potentials (Imax) and the difference in the mid-points of the steady-state inactivation<br>
curves (D V) in control and in the presence of a compound were used to calculate Kr and Kj using<br>
the following equations: <br>

Rat Formalin Paw test (in vivo assay):<br>
Compounds were assessed for their ability to inhibit the behavioral response evoked by a 50µL injection of formalin (5%). A metal band was affixed to the left hind paw of male Sprague-Dawiey rats (Charles River, 200-250g) and each rat was conditioned to the band for 60min within a plastic cylinder (15cm diameter). Rats were dosed with either vehicle or a test compound either before (local) or after (systemic) formalin challenge. For local administration, compounds were prepared in a 1:4:5 vehicle of ethanol, PEG400 and saline (EPEGS) and injected subcutaneously into the dorsal surface of the left hind paw 5min prior to formalin. For systemic administration, compounds were prepared in either a EPEGS vehicle or a TweenSO (10%)/sterile water (90%) vehicle and were injected i.v. (via the lateral tail vein 15min after formalin) or p.o. (60min before formalin). The number of flinches was counted continuously for 60min using an automated nociception analyzer (UCSD Anesthesiology Research, San Diego, CA). Statistical significance was determined by comparing the total flinches detected in tie early (0-10min) and late (ll-60min) phase with an unpaired t-test.<br>
In vivo assay using Rat CFA model:<br>
Unilateral inflammation was induced with a 0.2 ml injection of complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA: Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Sigma; suspended in an oil/saline (1:1) emulsion; O.Smg Mycobacterivun/mL) in the plantar surface of the left hindpaw. This dose of CFA produced significant hind paw swelling but the animals exhibited normal grooming behavior and weight gain over the course of the experiment. Mechanical hyperalgesia was assessed 3 days after tissue injury using a Randall-Selitto test. Repeated Measures ANOVA, followed by Dunnett's Post Hoc test.<br>
SNL: Mechanical Allodynia (in vivo assay):<br>
Tactile allodynia was assessed with calibrated von Frey filaments using an up-down paradigm before and two weeks following nerve injury. Animals were placed in plastic cages with a wire mesh floor and allowed to acclimate for 15rnin before each test session. To<br>
determine the 50% response threshold, the von Frey filaments (over a range of intensities from 0,4 to 28.8g) were applied to the mid-plantar surface for 8s, or until a withdrawal response occurred. Following a positive response, an incrementally weaker stimulus was tested. If there was no response to a stimulus, then an incrementally stronger stimulus was presented. After the initial threshold crossing, this procedure was repeated for four stimulus presentations per animal per test session. Mechanical sensitivity was assessed 1 and 2 hr post oral administration of the test compound.<br>

Step 1: Preparation of<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
A mixture of selenium dioxide (1.50g), dioxane (6mL) and deionized water (0.25 mL) was stirred at 50° C for 15 minutes to dissolve the selenium dioxide, and then the methyl ketone (from Example 217, Step 4)(3.1g) was added in one portion to the reaction and refluxed for six hours. The reaction was cooled and filtered. The filtrate was concentrated in vacuo and the residue (yellow) was diluted in 50% EtOAc in hexanes and washed with saturated sodium<br><br>
thiosulfate solution until the organic layer was clear. The organic phase was dried over sodium sulfate and concentrated. The crude keto-aldehyde was used in the next step without further purification.<br>
Step 2;<br>
To a solution of the keto-aldehyde (from Step 1) (2.8g) in anhydrous methanol (3-lmL) at -30° C was added a pre-cooled solution of L-alaninamide hydrochloride (1.20g) in anhydrous methanol (6.2ml). A 2M NaOH solution (6.2ml) was then added dropwise, and the mixture was stirred at 0°C for 2h and then 2h at room temperature.<br>
The reaction was quenched with 10ml of IN HC1, then neutralized with ~lg of solid sodium bicarbonate. The solvent was removed in vacua and the residue was extracted with EtOAc. The organic phase was washed with water, dried over sodium sulfate and concentrated to give a mixture of regioisomers of pyrazinones that were not separated and carried to the next step. MS:m/e347(M+l)+<br>
Step 3:<br>
A mixture of the pyrazinone isomers from Step 2 (1.75g) and POCls (8 mL) were placed in sealed tube and heated to 170° C for 18 hours. The reaction was concentrated in vacuo and the residue was dissolved in EtOAc. The organic phase was washed with water and saturated sodium bicarbonate solution, then dried over sodium sulfate. The regioisomers were separated by column chromatography on silica gel using a gradient of 5-6% EtOAc in hexanes. The less polar isomer was then taken forward to Step 4 described below. MS:m/e365(M-H)+<br>
Step 4:<br>
To a solution of the chloropyrazine (from Step 3) (0.3 Ig) in EtOH (3 mL) were added sodium acetate (77mg) and 10% (w/w) palladium on carbon (O.lg). The reaction was shaken under 45 pounds of hydrogen gas for four hours. After that period, the reaction aws filtered through a pad of Celite and the filtrate was concentrated in vacuo. The crude product was purified by column chromatography on silica gel using 15% EtOAc in hexanes to give the titled methyl pyrazine compound. MS:m/e331<br>
EXAMPLE 230<br>
To a solution of the methyl pyrazine (from Example 229 Step 4) (0.05 Ig) in anhydrous pyridine (0.3 mL) was added a solution of nBu4N+MnO4"(0.11g) in pyridine (0.3 niL) slowly and the reaction was stirred at room temperature for 30 min. and then at 65° C overnight. Two additional equivalents of tetrabutylammonium permanganate were added the following morning and the reaction was heated for two more hours. The reaction was allowed to cool to room temperature at which point it was quenched with saturated sodium thiosulfate sulfate. The aqueous layer was acidified to pH=l with 1 N HCI. The aqueous layer was subsequently extracted with two portions of EtOAc. The organics were further washed with 1 N HCI and dried over sodium sulfate. The organic material was concentrated via rotary evaporator. No further purification was attempted. MS:m/e361(M+l)+<br>
EXAMPLE 231<br>
The acid (54mg) (from Example 230) was dissolved in 200ul of anhydrous DMF and treated with carbonyl diimidazole (49mg) at room temperature for 1 hour. Then, solid ammonium acetate (46mg) was added and the reaction was allowed to continue overnight. The reaction was quenched with ~4ml of HaO and the aqueous layer extracted with 2 x 4ml portions of EtOAc. The organics were dried over sodium sulfate and concentrated on the rotary evaporator. The crude material was purified by column chromatography on silica gel using 50% EtOAc in hexanes to give the pure amide.<br>
