				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>RICE PROMOTERS<br>
The present invention relates to the field of plant molecular biology, more particularly to nucleic<br>
acid sequences useful for driving and/or regulating expression of an operably linked nucleic acid<br>
in plants. The isolati on of these nucleic acid sequences from rice, as well as their use in driving<br>
and/or regulating expression of an operably linked nucleic acid is disclosed. The present invention<br>
therefore concerns promoters, hybrid promote rs, genetic constructs, expression cassettes,<br>
transformation vectors, expression vectors, host cells and transgenic plants comprising the<br>
isolated nucleic acids according to the present invention. The present invention also concerns<br>
methods for driving and/or regulating expression of a nucleic acid and methods for the production<br>
of transgenic plants.<br>
Gene expression is dependent on initiation of transcription, which is mediated via the transcription<br>
initiation complex. Gene expression is also dependent on regulation of transcription, which<br>
regulation determines how strong, when or where a gene is expressed . Said regulation of gene<br>
expression may be mediated via transcriptional control elements, which are generally embedded<br>
in the nucleic acid sequence 5'-flanking or upstream of the expressed gene. This upstream nucleic<br>
acid region is often referred to as a "promoter" since it promotes the binding, formation and/or<br>
activation of the transcription initiation complex and therefore is capable of driving and/or<br>
regulating expression of the 3' downstream nucleic acid sequence.<br>
Genetic engineering of plants with the aim of obtaining a useful plant phenotype, often involves<br>
heterologous gene expression, which is generally mediated by a promoter capable of driving<br>
and/or regulating expression of an operably linked heterologous nucleic acid. The phenotype of<br>
the host plant only depends on the contribution of the heterologous nucleic acid, but also on the<br>
contribution of the specific expression pattern of the chosen promoter determining how, where and<br>
when that heterologous nucleic acid is expressed. Accordingly, the choice of promoter with a<br>
suitable expression pattern is of crucial importance for obtaining the suitable phenotype. A person<br>
skilled in the art will need to have available different promoters, to determine the o ptimal promoter<br>
for a particular nucleic acid. For many different host plants, this availability is rather limited and<br>
there is therefore a continuing need to provide new promoters with various expression profiles.<br>
(a) an isolated nucleic acid as given in any one of SEQ ID NO 1 to 22 or the complement<br>
of any one of SEQ ID N01 to 22; or<br>
(b) an isolated nucleic acid having at least 90% sequence identity with any of the DNA<br>
sequences as given in any one of SEQ ID NO 1 to 22; or<br>
(c) an isolated nucleic acid specifically hybridizing under stringent conditions with any of<br>
the DNA sequences as given in any one of SEQ ID NO 1 to 22; or<br>
(d) an isolated nucleic acid as defined in any one of (a) to (c), which is inte rrupted by an<br>
intervening sequence; or<br>
(e) a fragment of any of the nucleic acids as defined in (a) to (d), which fragment is<br>
capable of driving and/or regulating expression.<br>
Suitable variants of any one of SEQ ID NO 1 to 22 encompass homologues which have in<br>
increasing order of preference at least 90%, 91%. 92%, 93%. 94%, 95%. 96%, 97%, 98% or 99%<br>
sequence identity with any one of the nucleic acids as represented in SEQ ID N01 to 22 .<br>
The percentage of Identity may be calculated using an alignment program. Preferably a pair wise<br>
global alignment program may be used , which implements the algorithm of Needleman -Wunsch<br>
(J. Mol. Biol. 48:443-453,1970). This algorithm maximizes the number of matches and minimizes<br>
the number of gaps. Such programs are for example GAP, Needle (EMBOSS package), stretcher<br>
(EMBOSS package) or Align X (Vector NT) suite 5.5) and may use the standard parameters (for<br>
example gap opening penalty 15 and gap extension penalty 6.66). Alternatively , a local alignment<br>
program implementing the algorithm of Smith -Waterman (Advances in Applied Mathematics 2,<br>
482-489 (1981)) may be used. Such programs are for example Water (EMBOSS package) or<br>
matcher (EMBOSS package). "Sequence identity' as used herein is preferably calculated over the<br>
entire length of the promoters as represented by any one of SEQ ID NO 1 to 22 . The length of<br>
these promoters is presented in Table 2.<br>
Search and identification of homolog ous nucleic acids, would be well within the realm of a person<br>
skilled in the art. Such methods, involve screening sequence databases with the sequences<br>
provided by the present invention, for example any one of SEQ ID NO 1 to 22, preferably in a<br>
computer readable form. Useful sequence databases, include but are not limited to Genbank<br>
(httoMvww.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/web/Genbank ). the European Molecular Biology Laboratory Nucleic<br>
acid Database (EMBL) (http:yw.ebi.ac.uk/ebi -docs/embl-db.html) or versions thereof, or the MIPS<br>
database (http://mips.gsf.de/). Different search algorithms and software for the alignment and<br>
comparison of sequences are well known in the art. Such software includes , for example GAP,<br>
BESTFIT, BLAST, FASTA and TFASTA. Preferably BLAST software is used, which calculates<br>
percent sequence identity and performs a statistical analysis of the similarity between the<br>
sequences. The suite of programs referred to as BLAST programs has 5 different<br>
implementations: three designed for nucleotide sequence queries (BLASTN, BLASTX, and<br>
TBLASTX) and two designed for protein sequence queries (BLASTP and TBLASTN) (Coulson,<br>
Trends in Biotechnology: 76 -60,1994; Birren et al., GenomeAnalysis, 1:543,1997). The software<br>
for performing BLAST analysis is publicly available through the National Centre for B iotechnology<br>
Information.<br>
The sequences of the genome of Arabidopsis thaliana and the genome of O/yza sativa are now<br>
available in public databases such as Genbank . Other genomes are currently being sequenced.<br>
Therefore, it is expected that as more sequences of the genomes of other plants become<br>
available, homologous promoters may be identifiable by sequence alignment with any one of SEQ<br>
ID NO 1 to SEQ ID NO 22. The skilled person will readily be able to find homologous promoters<br>
from other plant species, for example from other crop plants, such as maize. Homologous<br>
promoters from other crop plants are especially useful for practising the methods of the present<br>
invention in crop plants.<br>
One example of homologues having at least 90% sequence identity with any one of SEQ ID NO to<br>
22 are allelic variants of any one of SEQ ID NO 1 to 22. Allelic variants are variants of the same<br>
gene occurring in two different individuals of the same species and usually allelic variants differ by<br>
slight sequence changes. Allelic variants may encompass Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms<br>
(SNPs) as well as Small Insertion/Deletion Polymorphisms (INDELs). The size of INDELs is<br>
usually less than 100 bp. SNPs and INDE Ls form the largest set of sequence variants in naturally<br>
occurring polymorphic strains of most organisms.<br>
Homologues suitable for use in the methods according to the invention may readily be isolated<br>
from their source organism via the te chnique of PCR or hybridization. Their capability of driving<br>
and/or regulating expression may readily be determined, for example, by following the methods<br>
described in the Examples section by simply substituting the sequence used in the actual<br>
Example with the homologue.<br>
Other suitable variants of any one of SEQ ID NO 1 to 22 encompassed by the present invention<br>
are nucleic acids specifically hybridising under stringent conditions to any one of the nucleic acids<br>
of SEQ ID NO 1 to 22. The term "hybridising" means annealing to substantially homologous<br>
complementary nucleolide sequences in a hybridization process. Tools in molecular biology<br>
'relying on such a hybridization process include the polymera se chain reaction (PCR; and all<br>
methods based thereon), subtractive hybridisation, random primer extension, nuclease S1<br>
mapping, primer extension, reverse transcription, cDNA synthesis, differential display of RNAs,<br>
and DNA sequence determination, Northern blotting (RNA blotting), Southern blotting (DNA<br>
blotting). The hybridisation process can also occur with one of the complementary nucleic acids<br>
immobilised to a matrix such as magnetic beads, Sepharose beads or any other resin. Tools in<br>
molecular biology relying on such a process include the isolation of poly (A+) mRNA. The<br>
hybridisation process can furthermore occur with one of the complementary nucleic acids<br>
immobilised to a solid support such as a nitro -cellulose or nylon membrane or immobilised by e.g.<br>
photolithography to, for example, a siliceous glass support (the latter known as nucleic acid arrays<br>
or microarrays or as nucleic acid chips). Tools in molecular biology relying on such a process<br>
include RNA and DNA gel blot analysis, colony hybridisation . plaque hybridisation, in situ<br>
hybridisation and microarray hybridisation. In order to allow hybridisation to occur, the nucleic acid<br>
molecules are generally thermally or chemically denatured to melt a double strand into two single<br>
strands and/or to remove hairpins or other secondary structures from single stranded nucleic<br>
acids. The stringency of hybridisation is influenced by conditions such as temperature, salt<br>
concentration and hybridisation buffer composition. Conventional hybridisation conditions are<br>
described in, for example, Sambrook (2001) Molecular Cloning: a laboratory manual, 3rd Edition<br>
Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, CSH, New York, but the skilled craftsman will appreciate<br>
that numerous different hybridisation conditions can be designed in function of the known or the<br>
expected homology and/or length of the nucleic acid sequence. High stringency conditions for<br>
hybridisation include high temperature and/or low sodium/salt concentration (salts include sodium<br>
as for example in NaCI and Na 3-citrate) and/or the i nclusion of formamide in the hybridisation<br>
buffer and/or lowering the concentration of compounds such as SDS (sodium dodecyl sulphate<br>
detergent) In the hybridisation buffer and/or exclusion of compounds such as dextran sulphate or<br>
polyethylene glycol (promoting molecular crowding) from the hybridisation buffer. Specifically<br>
hybridising under stringent conditions means that the sequences have to be very similar . Specific<br>
hybrisization under stringent conditions is preferably carried out at a temperature of 60°C followed<br>
by washes in 0.1 to 1 XSSC, 0.1XSDS, and 1X SSC, 0.1X SDS.<br>
The invention also relates to a nucleic acid molecule of at least 15 nucleotides in length<br>
hybridizing specifically with any of the nucleic acids of the invent! on. The invention also relates to<br>
a nucleic acid molecule of at least 15 nucleotides in length specifically amplifying a nucleic acid of<br>
the invention by polymerase chain reaction.<br>
Another variant of any of SEQ ID NO 1 to 22 encompassed by the pr esent invention are nucleic<br>
acids corresponding to any one of SEQ ID NO 1 to 22 or variants thereof as described<br>
hereinabove, which are interrupted by an intervening sequence. For example, any of the nucleic<br>
acids as presented in SEQ ID NO 1 to 22 may be interrupted by an intervening sequence. With<br>
"intervening sequences" is meant any nucleic acid or nucleotide, which disrupts another<br>
sequence. Examples of intervening sequences comprise introns, nucleic acid tags, T-DNA and<br>
mobilizable nucleic acids sequences such as transposons or nucleic acids that can be mobilized<br>
via recombination. Examples of particular tra nsposons comprise Ac (activator), Ds (Dissociation),<br>
Spm (suppressor-Mutatorj or En. The introduction of introns Into promoter s is now widely applied.<br>
The methods according to the present i nvenlion may also be practised using a nucleic acid<br>
sequence according to any one of SEQ ID NO 1 to 22 provided with an intron. In case the<br>
intervening sequence is an intron, alternative splice variants of the nucleic acids according to the<br>
invention may arise. The term 'alternative splice variant" as used herein encompasses variants of<br>
a nucleic acid sequence in which intervening introns have been excised, replaced or added. Such<br>
splice variants may be found in nature or may be manmade. Methods fo r making such promoters<br>
with an intron or for making the corresponding splice variants are well known in the art<br>
Variants interrupted by an intervenin g sequence, suitable for use in the methods according to th e<br>
invention may readily be determined for example by following the methods described in the<br>
Examples section by simply substituting the sequence used in the actual Example with the variant.<br>
The variant nucleic acids as described hereinabove may be found in nature (for example allelic<br>
variants or splice variants). Additionally and/or alternatively, variants of any one of SEQ ID N01 to<br>
22 as described hereinabove may be manmade via techniques well known in the art involving for<br>
example mutation, substitution, Insertion, deletions or derivation . T he present Invention also<br>
encompasses such variants, as well as their use in the methods of the present invention .<br>
A "mutation variant" of a nucleic acid may readily be mad e using recombinant DMA manipulation<br>
techniques or nucleotide synthesis. Examples of such techniques include site directed<br>
mutagenesis via M13 mutagenesis, 17-Gen in vitro mutagenesis (USB, Cleveland, OH),<br>
QuickChange Site Directed mutagenesis (Stratagene, San Diego, CA), PCR -mediated sitedirected<br>
mutagenesis or other site -directed mutagenesis protocols. Alternatively, the nucleic acid<br>
of the present invention may be randomly mutated.<br>
A "substitutions! variant" refers to those variants in which at least o ne residue in the nucleic acid<br>
sequence has been removed and a different residue inserted in its place. Nucleic acid<br>
substitutions are typically of single residues, but may be clustered depending upon functional<br>
constraints placed upon the nucleic acid sequence; insertions usually are of the order of about 1<br>
to about 10 nucleic acid residues, and deletions can range from about 1 to about 20 residues.<br>
An "insertional variant" of a nucleic acid is a variant in which one or more nucleic acid residues are<br>
introduced into a predetermined site in that nucleic acid. Insertions may comprise 5' -terminal<br>
and/or 3'-terminal fusions as well as intra-sequence insertions of single or multiple nucleotides.<br>
Generally, insertions within the nucleic acid sequence will be smaller than 5'- or 3'-termina!<br>
fusions, of the order of about 1 to 10 residues. Examples of 5' - or 3'-terminal fusions include the<br>
coding sequences of binding domain s or activation domains of a transcriptional activator as used<br>
in the yeast two-hybrid system or yeast one-hybrid system, or of phage coat proteins, (histidine) etag,<br>
glutathione S-transferase-tag, protein A, maltose-binding protein, dihydrofolate reductase,<br>
Tag* 100 epitope, c-myc epitope, FLAG"-epitope, lacZ, CMP (calmodulin -binding peptide), HA<br>
epitope, protein C epitope and VSV epitope.<br>
The term "derivative" of a nucleic acid may comprise substitutions, and/or deletions and/or<br>
additions of naturally and non -naturally occurring nucleic acid residues compared to the natural<br>
nucleic acid. Derivatives may, for example, comprise methylated nucleotides, or artificial<br>
nucleotides.<br>
Also encompassed with in the present invention are promoters, comprising a fragment of any of<br>
the nucleic acids as presented by any one of SEQ ID N01 to 22 or variants thereof as described<br>
hereinabove. A fragment" as used herein means a portion of a nucleic acid sequence. Suitable<br>
fragments useful in the methods of the present invention are functional fragment s, which retain at<br>
least one of the functional parts of the promoter and hence are still capable of driving and/or<br>
regulating expression. Examples of functional fragments of a promoter include the minimal<br>
promoter, the upstream regulatory elements, or any combination thereof.<br>
Suitable fragment? may range from at least about 20 base pairs or about 50,100, 150, 200,250,<br>
300, 350, 400, 450, 500, 550, 600, 650, 700, 750, 800, 850, 900, 950 or 100 0 base pairs, up to<br>
about the full length sequence of the invention. T hese base pairs are typically immediately<br>
upstream of the transcription initiation start, but alternatively may be from anywhere in the<br>
promoter sequence.<br>
Suitable fragments useful in the methods of the present invention may be tested for their capability<br>
of driving and/or regulating expression by standard techniques well known to the skilled person, or<br>
by the following method described in the Example section .<br>
The promoters as disclosed in any one of SEQ ID NO 1 to 22 are isolated as nucleic acids of<br>
approximately 1.2kb from the upstream region of particular rice coding sequences (CDS). These<br>
nucleic acids may include typical elements of a promoter, which are presented in Figure 1.<br>
Generally, a promoter may comprises from coding sequence to the upstream direction: (i) an<br>
5'UTR of pre-messenger RNA, (ii) a minimal promoter comprising the transcription initiation<br>
element (INR) and more upstream a TATA box, and (iii) may contain regulatory elements that<br>
determine the specific expression pattern of the promoter.<br>
The term "promoter" as used herein is taken in a broad context and refers to regulatory nucleic<br>
acid sequences capable of effecting (driving and/or regulating) expression of the sequences to<br>
which they are operably linked. A "promoter* encompasses transcriptions! regulatory sequences<br>
derived from a classical genomic gene. Usually a promoter comprises a TATA box, which is<br>
capable of directing the transcription initiation complex to the appropriate transcription initiation<br>
start site. However, some promoters do not have a TATA box (TATA -less promoters), but are still<br>
fully functional for driving and/or regulat ing expression. A promoter may additionally comprise a<br>
CCAAT box sequence and additional regulatory elements (i.e. upstream activating sequences or<br>
cis-elements such as enhancers and silencers). A "promoter" may also include the transcriptional<br>
regulatory sequences of a classical prokaryotic gene, in which case it may include a -35 box<br>
sequence and/or a -10 box transcriptional regulatory sequences.<br>
"Driving expression" as used herein means promoting the transcription of a nucleic acid.<br>
"Regulating expression" as used herein means influencing the level, time or place of transcription<br>
of a nucleic acid. The promoters of the present Invention may thus be used to increase, decrease<br>
or change in time and/or place transcription of a nucleic acid. For example, t hey may be used to<br>
limit the transcription to certain cell types, tissues or organs, or during a certain period of time, or<br>
in response to certain environmental conditions.<br>
The promoter is preferably a plant-expressible promoter. The term "plant -expressible" means<br>
being capable of regulating expression in a plant, plant cell, plant tissue and/or plant organ.<br>
Accordingly, the inventbn encompasses an isolated nucleic acid as mentioned above, capable of<br>
regulating transcription of an operably linked nucleic acid in a plant or in one or more particular<br>
cells, tissues or organs of a plant.<br>
The expression pattern of the promoters according to the present invention were studied in detail<br>
and it was found that many of them were tissue-specific. Accordingly, the present invention<br>
provides "tissue-specific" promoters. The term "tissue -specific" shall be taken to indicate that<br>
expression is predominantly in a particular tissue, tissue -type, organ or any other pa rt of the<br>
organism, albeit not necessarily exclusively in said tissue, tissue -type, organ or other part.<br>
Accordingly, the invention encompasses an isolated nucleic acid as mentioned above, capable of<br>
driving and/or regulating expression (of an operably linked nucleic acid) in a tissue-specific<br>
manner. Expression may be driven and/or regulated In the seed, embryo, scutellum, aleurone,<br>
endosperm, leaves, flower, calli, meristem, shoot meristem, discriminating centre, shoot, shoot<br>
meristem and root In grasses the shoot meristem is located in the so -called discrimination zone<br>
from where the shoot and the leaves originate.<br>
A tissue-specific promoter is one example of a so -called "regulated promoter*. These promoters<br>
are regulated by endogenous signals such as the presence of certain transcription factors,<br>
metabolites, plant hormones, or exogenous signals, such as ag eing, stresses or nutritional status.<br>
These regulations may have an effect on one or more different levels such spatial specificity or<br>
temporal specificity. Encompassed within the present invention is a nucleic acid as described<br>
hereinabove, which is a "regulated promoter*. Examples of regulated promoters are cell -specific<br>
promoters, tissue-specific promoters, organ-specific promoters, cell cycle-specific promoters,<br>
inducible promoters or young tissue-specific promoters.<br>
Alternatively and/or additionally, some promoters of the present invention display a con stitutive<br>
expression pattern. Accordingly, the present invention provides a promoter as described<br>
hereinabove, which is a constitutive promoter. The term "constitutive" means having no or very<br>
few spatial or temporal regulations. The term "constitutive expression" as used herein refers to a<br>
substantially continuously expression in substantially all tissues of the organism. The skilled<br>
craftsman will understand that a "constitutive promoter" is a promote r that is active during most,<br>
but not necessarily all, phases of growth and development of the organism and throughout most,<br>
but not necessarily all, parts of an organism.<br>
The "expression pattern" of a promoter is not only influenced by the spatial and te mporal aspects,<br>
but also by the level of expression. The level of expression is determined by the so -called<br>
"strength" of a promoter. Depending on the resulting expression level, a distinction is made herein<br>
between "weak" or "strong" promoters. Gen erally by "weak promoter" is meant a promoter that<br>
drives expression of an operably linked nucleic acid at levels of about 1/10 000 transcripts to about<br>
1/100000 transcripts to about 1/500000 transcripts . Generally, by "strong promoter" is meant a<br>
promoter that drives expression at levels of about 1/10 transcripts, to about 1/100 or to about<br>
1/1000 transcripts.<br>
According to a particular embodiment, the invention provides an Isolated promoter as mentioned<br>
hereinabove, which is a hybrid promoter. The term "hybrid promoter" as used herein refers to a<br>
chimeric promoter made, for example, synthetically, for example by genetic engineering. Preferred<br>
hybrid promoters according to the present invention comprise a part, preferably a functional part,<br>
of one of the promoters according to the present invention and at leas t another part, preferably a<br>
functional part of a promoter. The latter part, may be a part of any promoter, including any one of<br>
the promoters according to the present invention and other promoters. One example of a hybrid<br>
promoter comprises regulatory elements) of a promoter according to the present invention<br>
combined with the minimal promoter of another promoter. Another example of a hybrid promoter is<br>
a promoter comprising additional regulatory elements to further enhance its activity and/or to alter<br>
its spatial and/or temporal expression pattern.<br>
The present invention also provides use of a functional fragment of any one of SEQ ID N01 to 22<br>
or variant thereof for changing the expression pattern of a promoter. In such methods , at least part<br>
of any of the nucleic acids according to the present invention are combined with at least one<br>
fragment of another promoter.<br>
Further, the invention provides a genetic constru ctcomprising:<br>
(a) An isolated promoter as defined hereinabove<br>
(b) A heterologous nucleic acid sequence operably linked to isolated promoter of (a), and<br>
optionally<br>
(c) A 3' transcription terminator<br>
The term "genetic construct" as used herein m eans a nucleic acid made by genetic engineering.<br>
The term "operably linked" to a promoter as used herein means that the transcription is driven<br>
and/or regulated by that promoter. A person skilled in the art will understand that being operably<br>
linked to a promoter preferably means that the promoter is positioned upstream fl.e. at the ff-end)<br>
of the operably linked nucleic acid. The distance to the operably linked nucleic acid may be<br>
variable, as long as the promoter of the present invention is capable of driving and/or regulating<br>
the transcription of the operably linked nudeic acid. For example, between the promoter and the<br>
operably linked nucleic acid, there might be a cloning site, an adaptor, a transcription or<br>
translation enhancer.<br>
The operably linked nucleic acid may be any coding or non -coding nucleic acid. The operably<br>
linked nucleic acid may be in the sense or in the anti-sense direction. Typically in the case of<br>
genetic engineering of host cells, the operably linked nucleic acid is to be introduced into the host<br>
cell and is intended to change the phenotype of the host cell. Alternatively, the operably linked<br>
nucleic acid is an endogenous nucleic acid from the host cell.<br>
The term "heterologous" as used herein is intended to be "heterologous to the promoter of the<br>
present invention*. A nucleic add that is heterologous to the promoter of the present invention is<br>
not naturally occurring in the nucleic add sequences flanking the promoter of the present<br>
invention when it is in its biological genomic environment. While the nucleic add may be<br>
heterologous to the promoter of the present invention, it may be h omologous or native or<br>
heterologous or foreign to the plant host cell. The heterologous operably linked nucleic acid may<br>
be any nudeic acid (for example encoding any protein), provided that it comprises or it is flanked<br>
by at least one nucleotide which is normally not flanking the promoter of the present invention.<br>
The term "transcription terminator" as used in (c) refers to a DNA sequence at the end of a<br>
transcriptional unit which signals termination of transcription. Terminators are 3' -non-translated<br>
DNA sequences usually containing a polyadenylation signal, which facilitates the addition of<br>
polyadenylate sequences to the 3' -end of a primary transcript Terminators active in and/or<br>
isolated from viruses, yeasts, moulds, bacteria, insects, birds, mammals and plants are known and<br>
have been described in literature. Examples of terminators suitable for use in the genetic<br>
constructs of the present invention include the Agmbacterium tumefaciens nopaline synthase<br>
(NOS) gene terminator, the Agmbacterium tumefaciens octopine synthase (DCS) gene terminator<br>
sequence, the Cauliflower mosa ic virus (CaMV) 358 gene terminator sequence, the Oryza saliva<br>
ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase terminator sequence (t3'Bt2), the Zea mays zein gene terminator<br>
sequence, the rbcs-1A gene terminator, and the rbcs-3A gene terminator sequences, amongst<br>
others.<br>
The present invention also provides an expression cassette, a transformation vector or a plant<br>
expression vector comprising a genetic construct as described above.<br>
An "expression cassette" as meant herein refe rs to a minimal genetic construct necessary for<br>
expression of a nucleic acid. A typical expression cassette compris es a promoter-gene-terminator<br>
combination. An expression cassette may additionally comprise cloning sites, for example<br>
GatewayTM recombination sites or restriction enzyme recognition sites , to allow easy cloning of<br>
the operably linked nucleic acid or to allow the easy transfer of the expression cassette into a<br>
vector. An expression cassette may further comprise 5' untranslated regions , 3' untranslated<br>
regions, a selectable marker, transcription enhancers or translation enhancers.<br>
With "transformation vector" is meant a genetic construct, which may be introduced in an<br>
organism by transformation and may be stably maintained in said organism. Some vectors may be<br>
maintened in for example Escherichia coli, A. tumefaciens, Saccharomyces cerevisiae or<br>
Schizosaccharomyces pombe, while others such as phagemids and cosmid vectors, may be<br>
maintained in bacteria and/or viruses. Transformation vectors may be multiplied in their host cell<br>
and may be isolated again therefrom to be transformed into another host cell. Vector sequences<br>
generally comprise a set of unique sites recognized by restriction enzymes, the multiple cloning<br>
site (MCS), wherein one or more non-vector sequence(s) can be inserted. Vector sequences may<br>
further comprise an origin of replication which is required for maintenance and/or replication in a<br>
specific host cell. Examples of origins of replication include, but are not li mited to, the f1 -on and<br>
colE1.<br>
"Expression vectors" form a subset of transformation vectors, which, by virtue of comprising the<br>
appropriate regulatory sequences, enabl e expression of the inserted non -vector sequence(s).<br>
Expression vectors have been described which are suitable for expression in bacteria (e.g. £<br>
coli), fungi (e.g. S. cerevisiae, S. pombe, Fichia pastoris), insect cells (e.g. baculoviral expression<br>
vectors), animal cells (e.g. COS or CHO cells) and plant cells . One suitable expression vector<br>
according to the present invention is a plant expression vector, useful for the transformation of<br>
plant cells, the stable integration in the plant genome, the maintenance in the plant cell and the<br>
expression of the non-vector sequences In the plant cell.<br>
Typically, a plant expression vector according to the present invention comprises a nucleic acid of<br>
any one of SEQ ID NO 1 to 22 or a variant thereof as described hereinabove, optionally operably<br>
linked to a second nucleic acid. Typically, a plant expressible vector according to the present<br>
invention, further comprises T-DNA regions for stable integration into the plant genome (for<br>
example the left border and the right border regions of the Ti plasmid).<br>
The genetic constructs of the invention may further comprise a "selectable marker". As used<br>
herein, the term "selectable marker" includes any gene, which confers a phenotype to a cell in<br>
which it is expressed, to facilitate the identification and/or selection of cells that are transfected or<br>
transformed. Suitable markers may be selected from markers that confer antibiotic or herbicide<br>
resistance. Cells containing the genetic construct will thus survive antibiotics or herbicide<br>
concentrations that kill untransformed cells. Examples of selectable marker genes include genes<br>
conferring resistance to antibiotics (such as nptll encoding neomycin phosphotransferase capable<br>
of phosphorylating neomycin and kanamycin, or h pt encoding hygromycin phosphotransferase<br>
capable of phosphorylating hygromycin), to herbicides (for example bar which provides resistance<br>
to Basta; aroA or gox providing resistance against glyphosate), or genes that provide a metabolic<br>
trait (such as manA that allows plants to use mannose as sole carbon source). Visual marker<br>
genes result in the formation of colour (for example beta -glucuronidase, GUS), luminescence<br>
(such as luciferase) or fluorescence (Green Fluorescent Protein, GFP, and derivatives there of).<br>
Further examples of suitable selectable marker genes include the ampicillin resistance (Ampr),<br>
tetracycline resistance gene (Tcr), bacterial kanamycin resistance gene (Kanr), phosphinothricin<br>
resistance gene, and the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene, amongst others.<br>
Furthermore, the present invention encompasses a host cell comprising an isolated promoter, or a<br>
genetic construct, or an expression cassette, or a transformation vector or an expression vector<br>
according to the invention as described hereinabove. In particular embodiments of the invention,<br>
the host cell is selected from bacteria, algae, fungi, yeast, plant s, insect or animal host cells.<br>
In one particular embodiment, the invention provides a transgenic plant cell comprising an isolated<br>
promoter according to the invention, or an isolated nucleic acid, or a genetic construct, or an<br>
eicpression cassette, or a transformation vector or an expression vector according to the invention<br>
as described hereinabove. Preferably said plant cell is a dicot plant cell or a monocot plant cell,<br>
more preferably a cell of any of the plants as mentioned herein. Preferably, in the transgenic plant<br>
cell according to the invention, the promoter or the genetic construct of the invention is stably<br>
integrated into the genome of the plant cell.<br>
The invention also provides a method for the production of a transgenic plant, comprising:<br>
(a) Introducing into a plant cell an isolated promoter, for example any one of<br>
SEQ ID NO 1 to SEQ ID NO 22, or a variant or fragment thereof, or a<br>
genetic construct, or an expression cassette, or a transformation vector or<br>
an expression vector according to the present invention and as described<br>
hereinabove.and<br>
(b) Cultivating said plant cell under conditions promo ting plant growth.<br>
"Introducing" the above mentioned isolated promoter, orgenetic construct, or expression cassette,<br>
or transformation vector or expression vector, into a host cell (e.g. plant cell) is preferably<br>
achieved by transformation. The term "transformation" as used herein encompasses the transfer<br>
of an exogenous polynucleotide into a host cell, irrespective of the method used for transfer. In<br>
particular for plants, tissues capable of donal propagation, whether by organogenesis or<br>
embryogenesis, are suitable to be transformed with a genetic construct of the present invention<br>
and a whole plant may be regenerated therefrom. The particular tissue chosen will vary depending<br>
on the clonal propagation systems available for, and best suited t o, the particular plant species<br>
being transformed. Exemplary tissue targets include leaf disks, pollen, embryos, cotyledons,<br>
hypocotyls, megagametophytes, callus tissue, existing meristematic tissue (e.g., apical meristem,<br>
axillary buds, and root meristems), and induced meristem tissue (e.g., cotyledon meristem and<br>
hypocotyl meristem). The polynucleotide may be transiently or stably introduced into a plant cell<br>
and may be maintained non -integrated, for example, as a plasmid. Alternatively, it may be<br>
integrated into the plant genome.<br>
Transformation of a plant species is now a fairly routine technique. Advantageously, any of<br>
several transformation methods may be used to introduce the nucleic acid s of the invention into a<br>
suitable ancestor cell. Transformati on methods include the use of liposomes, electroporation,<br>
chemicals that increase free DNA uptake, injection of the DNA directly into the plant, particle gun<br>
bombardment, transformation using viruses or pollen and microprojection. Methods may be<br>
selected from the calcium/polyethylene glycol method for protoplasts (Krens, FA et a/., 1882,<br>
Nature 296. 72-74; Negrutiu I. et a/., June 1987, Plant Mol. Biol. 8. 363 -373); electroporation of<br>
protoplasts (Shillilo R.D. et si.. 1985 Biofiechnol 3,1099-1102); microinjection into plant material<br>
(Crossway A. et at., 1986, Mol. Gen Genet 202, 179-185); DNA or RNA-coated particle<br>
bombardment (Klein T.M. et al., 1987, Nature 327, 70) infection with (non -integrative) viruses and<br>
the like. A preferred transformation metho d for the production of transgenic plant cells according<br>
to the present invention, is an Agrobacterium mediated transformation method.<br>
Transgenic rice plants comprising any one of the promoters of the present invention are preferably<br>
produced via /\grobactera/m-mediated transformation using any of the well -known methods for<br>
rice transformation, such as the ones described in any of the following: published European patent<br>
application EP1198985 A1, Aldemita and Hodges (Planta, 199,612 -617,1996); Chan etal. (Plant<br>
Mol. Biol. 22 (3) 491 -506,1993); Hiei et al. (Plant J. 6 (2) 271 -282,1994); which disclosures are<br>
incorporated by reference herein as if fully set forth. In the case of com transformation, the<br>
preferred method is as described in either Ishida et al. (Nat. Biotechnol. 1996 Jun; 14(6): 745 -50)<br>
or Frame et al. (Plant Physiol. 2002 May; 129(1): 13 -22), which disclosures are incorporated by<br>
reference herein as if fully set forth.<br>
Generally after transformation, plant cells or cell groupings are se lected for the presence of one or<br>
more markers which are encoded by plant-expressible genes co -transferred with the gene of<br>
interest (which could be under the control of any of the promoters of the present invention),<br>
following which the transformed materi al may be cultivated under conditions promoting plant<br>
growth.<br>
The resulting transformed plant cell may then be used to regenerate a transformed plant in a<br>
manner known to persons skilled in the ait Accordingly, the method for the production of a<br>
transgenic plant as described hereinabove, may further comprise regenerating a plant from said<br>
plant cell of (a).<br>
The present invention further provides a plant comprising a plant cell as described hereinabove.<br>
The plants may also be able to grow, or even reach maturity including for example fruit production,<br>
seed formation, seed ripening and seed setting.<br>
Furthermore, progeny may be produced from these seeds, which progeny may be fertile.<br>
Alternatively or additionally, the transformed and regenerated plants may also produce progeny by<br>
non-sexual propagation such as cloning, grafting. The generated transformed plants may be<br>
propagated by a variety of means, such as by clonal propagation or classical breeding techniques.<br>
For example, a first generation (or T1) transformed plant may be selfed to give homozygous<br>
second generation (or T2) transformants, and the T2 plants further propagated through classical<br>
breeding techniques.<br>
The generated transformed organisms may take a variety of forms. For example, they may be<br>
chimeras of transformed cells and non -transformed cells; clonal transformants (e.g., all cells<br>
transformed to contain the expression cassette); grafts of transformed and untransformed tissues<br>
(e.g., in plants, a transformed rootst ock grafted to an untransformed scion).<br>
Following DMA transfer and growth of the transformed cells, putatively transformed plant cells or<br>
plants may be evaluated, for instance using Southern analysis, for the presence of the gene of<br>
interest, copy number and/or genomic organization. Alternatively or additionally, expression levels<br>
or expression patterns of the newly introduced DNA may be undertaken using northern and/or<br>
Western analysis, both techniques being well known to persons having ordinary skill in the art.<br>
The present invention clearly extends to plants obtainable by any of the methods according to the<br>
present invention, which plants comprise any of the isolated promoters or the constructs of the<br>
present invention. The present invention clearly ex tends to any plant parts and propagules of such<br>
plant The present invention extends further to encompass the progeny of a primary transformed<br>
cell, tissue, organ or whole plant that has been produced by any of the aforementioned methods,<br>
the only requirement being that progeny exhibit the same genotypic and/or phenotypic<br>
characteristic^) as those produced in the parent by the methods according to the invention. The<br>
invention also extends to harvestable parts of a plant, such as but not limited to seeds, I eaves,<br>
fruits, flowers, stem cultures, stem, rhizomes, roots, tubers, bulbs and cotton fibers.<br>
The term "plant" or "plants" as used herein encompasses whole plants, ancestors and progeny of<br>
plants and plant parts, including seeds, shoots, stems, roots (i ncluding tubers), and plant cells,<br>
tissues and organs. The term "plant" therefore also encompasses suspension cultures, embryos,<br>

of the present invention the plant is a monocotyledonous plant, such as sugarcane, further<br>
preferable a cereal such as rice, maize, wheat, barley, millet, rye or oats.<br>
The invention further provides a method for driving and/or regulating expression of a nucleic acid<br>
in a plant or plant eel I, comprising:<br>
a) Operably linking a nucleic acid to an isolated nucleic acid according to the invention as<br>
described hereinabove, such as to any one of SEQ ID NO 1 to 22 or a variant or<br>
fragment thereof, and<br>
b) Introducing the resultant genetic construct into a plant or plant cell.<br>
Preferably the operably linked nucleic acid of (a) is heterologous to the nucleic acids according to<br>
the present invention.<br>
This method may further comprise cultivating the transformed plant or plant cell under conditions<br>
promoting growth, promoting regeneration and/or promoting maturation.<br>
Furthermore, the expression of the operab ly linked nucleic acid may be driven and/or regulated in<br>
particular cells, tissues or organs of a plant Accordingly, the invention p rovides a method as<br>
described above, wherein the expression is constitutive expression or tissue -specific expression.<br>
For these embodiments, reference is made to the example section where the specific expression<br>
patterns of the promoters according to the invention are described and where different types of<br>
tissue-specific expression are detailed .<br>
The present invention further encompasses the u se of an isolated nucleic acid as defined<br>
hereinabove to drive and/or regulate expression of an operably I inked nucleic acid.<br>
The person skilled in the art will recognize that provision of sequences SEQ ID NO 1 to 22, readily<br>
makes available the tools to isolate related promoters, which may have substantial sequence<br>
identity to any of SEQ ID ID NO 1 to 22. Additionally, provision of sequences SEQ ID NO 23 to 44<br>
(CDS corresponding to the promoters of the present invention, see Table 1) , readily makes<br>
available the tools to isolate related promoters, of which the related CDSs may have substantial<br>
sequence identity to any of SEQ ID NO 23 to 44. Therefore the present invention also<br>
encompasses a method for isolating nucleic acids, capable of driving and/or regulating expression<br>
of an operably linked nucleic acid, comprising screening a nucleic acid sequence database to find<br>
homologues of any of the sequences represented by SEQ ID N01 to 22 or SEQ ID NO 2 3 to 44.<br>
Subsequently these homologues are used to screen a library with genomic DNA, which library is<br>
for example prepared from the organism of origin of the above mentioned homologue. The<br>
screening procedure may for example involve hybridization. Subsequently, the genomic DNA that<br>
matches the homologue, is analysed to identify the transcription initiation site and the translation<br>
initiation site of the gene corresponding to the homologue. Finally, specific primers are designed<br>
for amplification of a nucleic acid located in the region upstream (at the 5' end) of said translation<br>
initiation site.<br>
The present invention exten ds to the Identification of regulatory proteins that are involved in the<br>
regulation of the activity of the promoters according to the present invention. Such Identification<br>
may be achieved using a yeast one-hybrid system. In such a yeast one-hybrid system the<br>
sequences according to any one of SEQ ID NO 1 to 22 are operably linked to the GAL<br>
transcription activator and transformed to a yeast cell culture. That yeast cell culture is again<br>
transformed with a library of constructs encodi ng candidate regulatory factors.<br>
The present invention will now be described with reference to the following figures in which:<br>
Figure 1 shows a general schematic representation of a promoter. Regulatory elements are<br>
sequences that may for example be responsible for special and/or temporal regulation of the<br>
promoter activity. The minimal promoter is the minimal sequence necessary and suff icient to drive<br>
expression. It includes a TATA box, which is necessary to correctly direct the RNA polymerase It<br>
to the transcription initiation site. The transcription initiation element (INR) in dudes the<br>
transcription initiation start site. The 5' untranslated region (5'UTR) is the region that is transcribed<br>
into pre-messenger RNA and eventually in to mRNA, but is not translated into protein. The<br>
translation initiation codon is represented by the startcodon ATG.<br>
Figure 2 is a map of the vector p4581 useful for expression in plants of a p-glucuronidase (GUS)<br>
gene under control of any one of the promoters according to the Invention. Th is binary vector<br>
comprises a Gateway recombination cassette , suitable for the recombination cloning of any of the<br>
promoters of the present invention in front of the Escherichia coli [J-glucuronidase (GUS) gene.<br>
This cassette contains a chloramphenicol resistance gene (CamR) and the ccdB suicide gene for<br>
counter selection of non -recombined plasmids, This GUS expression cassette further comprises<br>
the double terminator sequence T-zein and T-rbcS-deltaGA. This expression cassette is located<br>
within the left border (LB repeat, LB Ti C58) and the right border (RB repeat, RB Ti C58) of the<br>
nopaline Ti plasmid. Cloned within these borders are also selectable marlcer and a screenable<br>
marker genes each under control of a constitutive promoter and a terminator sequence. This<br>
vector also contains an origin of replication (pBR322) for bacterial replication and a bacterial<br>
selectable marker (Spe/SmeR) for bacterial selection .<br>

Examples<br>
The promoters according to the present Invention were isolated as DMA regions spanning about<br>
1.2 kb of the sequence upstream of the translation initiation codon (i.e. first ATG, which codon<br>
was excluded) from various rice genes. For determinatio n of their nucleic acid sequence and their<br>
expression pattern, the following procedure was followed: First In silica studies on genomic rice<br>
sequences were performed . However, procedures based on automated prediction programs to<br>
locate promoter-like nucleic acid sequence are highly error prone, even for the localization the<br>
best-characterized promoter control elements such as the TATA box and the transcription initiation<br>
element (INR). Also, in silica determination of expression pattern is extremely speculative.<br>
Therefore, to obtain unambiguous data about the nucleic acid sequence and the expression<br>
pattern of the promoter s, in vivo studies were performed encompassing (i) isolation of the<br>
promoter nucleic acid sequence ; (0) operably linking a reporter gen e to the promoter and<br>
introducing the resulting genetic construct into a host organisms ; (iii) growing the transformed host<br>
cell under conditions allowing expression of the reporter gene, and (iv) determination of the<br>
reporter gene activity in the dilferen t tissues of the host organism. These methods are now<br>
described in more detail.<br>
1. Identification and isolation of the promoters<br>
Identification office ESTs, tlte corresponding genes and their location In the rice genome<br>
Sequence databases, comprising rice sequences, were searched for rice expressed sequence<br>
tags (ESTs). Subsequently an" in silico" Northern -Wot was performed to allow identification of EST<br>
families that are strongly expressed or that are specific for a particular organ. This analysis<br>
included normalization of the numbers of ESTs isolated from different plant organs. The ESTs<br>
families with an interesting distribution among source cDNA libraries were selected for further<br>
analysis and sequence homology searches. After sequence homology searches in combination<br>
with scanning scientific data, the genes that correspond to those families of EST s were identified<br>
from sequence databases and a (putative) function and corresponding gene name was given (see<br>
Table 1). Subsequently , the corresponding promoter region was isolated by the following<br>
procedure. In a first step the TIQR database was searched to find a tentative contig corresponding<br>
to an EST family. Sequence homology was found using standard computer programs , such as<br>
Blast N using standard parameters (typically G Cost to open a gap = 5, E Cost to extend a gap =<br>
2, q Penalty for a mismatch in the blast portion of run = -3, r Reward for a match in the blast<br>
portion of run = 1, e Expectation value = 10.0, W Word size= 11, v Number of one-line<br>
descriptions = 100, b Number of alignments to show = 100, Matrix = BLOSUM62). The TIGR<br>
database (The Institute for Genomic Research), provides Tentative Contigs (TC) which are<br>
sequence predictions based on contig building from all known EST, from all known cDNA and<br>
from reconstructed mRNA. The TCs used for Identification of the promoters of the present<br>
invention are represented in Table 1. In a second step these TCs were used to locate the<br>
corresponding gene on a genomic sequence, which gene comprises the coding region as well as<br>
the promoter region. Generally, these genomic sequences were 6AC clones, which are<br>
represented herein by their Genbank accession number (see Table 1). From these BAC clones<br>
the sequence identity of the promoter region could be determined.<br>
Table 1: list of rice promoters of the present invention. The promoter sequences are represented<br>
herein by their SEQ ID NO and promoter number (PRO). The coding sequences (CDS) naturally<br>
driven by a promoter of the present invention are represented by their name, by SEQ ID NO and<br>
by Tentative contig ( TC) accession number of the TIGR database. The Genomic sequences (BA C<br>
clones or genes) comprising a promoter region of the present invention are represented by their<br>
Genbank accession number.<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Identification and Isolation of the promoter regions of rice genes<br>
Starting from the sequence information of the gene s and their location in the rice genome, the<br>
promoter regions of these genes were isolated as the DMA region spanning about 1.2 kb<br>
upstream of the translab'on initiation codon (i.e. first ATG), which codon was excluded. When an<br>
intervening sequence such a s an inlron, was present in the 5' untranslated region of the gene, the<br>
isolated DMA region was taken as the region spanning about 1.2 kb plus the length of that<br>
intervening sequence. The promoter regions were isolated from genomic DNA of Oryza sativa<br>
Japonica or exceptionally from Oryza sativa Indica via PCR using specific primers. These specific<br>
primers comprise AttB recombination sites, suitable for recombination cloning of the isolated<br>
25<br>
promoter region These specific primers are herein represented as SEQ ID NO 45 to 88 and are<br>
listed in Table 2. Conditions for PCR were as follows: 1 cycle of 2 min at 94°C, 35 cycles of 1 min<br>
at 94°C, 1 min at 58°C and 2 min at 68°C, and 1 cycle of 5 min at 68"C. The length of the<br>
expected PCR fragment is also indicated in Table 2. The corresponding PCR fragment was<br>
purified from the PCR reaction mix via gele electrophoresis and subsequent purification using<br>
Zymoclean Gel DMA Recovery Kit (Zymo Research, Orange, California).<br>

Example 2. Cloning of promoter-GUS reporter vectors for plant transformation<br>
The purified PCR fragments of Example 1, corresponding to the promoter regions of the present<br>
invention, were cloned into the pDONR201 entry plasmid of the GatewayTM system (Life<br>
Technologies) using the "BP recombination reaction". T he identity and base pair composition of<br>
the cloned insert was confirmed by sequencing and additionally, the resulting plasmid was tested<br>
via restriction digests.<br>
In order to done each of the promoters of the present invention in front of a reporter gene, each<br>
entry clone of Example 1 was subsequently used in an "LR recombination reaction" (Gateway TM)<br>
with the destination vector p4581. This destination vector was designed to operably link each<br>
promoter of the present invention to the Escherichia coli beta-glucuronidase (GUS) gene via the<br>
substitution of the Gateway recombination cassette in front of the GUS gene. Furthermore this<br>
destination vector is suitable for transformation of plants and comprises within the T -DMA left and<br>
right borders the resulting promoter-GUS cassette and selectable marker and screenable marker<br>
cassettes (see Figure 2). The resulting reporter vectors, comprising a promoter of the present<br>
invention operably linked to GUS, are subsequently transformed into Agrobacterium strain<br>
LBA4044 and subsequently into rice plants using standard transformation techniques .<br>
Example 3. Expression pattern s of the promoter-GUS reporter cassette in plants<br>
Growth and harvest of transgenic plants or plant parts at various stages (C plants, B plants<br>
and A plants)<br>
For each promoter-GUS reporter construct, 3 TO transgenic rice plants were generated from<br>
transformed cells. Plant growth was performed under normal conditions. The first transgenic plant<br>
was sacrificed for GUS staining when it had reached a size of about 5 cm, which plant is named<br>
herein "C plant". The second transgenic plant was sacrificed for GUS staining when it had reached<br>
a size of about 10 cm, which plant is named herein "B plant". The third transgenic plant was kept<br>
for seed production and is named herein "A plant". GUS staining was performed on complete C<br>
and B plants. On A plants, GUS staining was performed on leaf pieces, flowers and section of<br>
seeds at various developmental stages. A plants were allowed to set seed, which seeds were<br>
used after harvest for confirmation of the expression pattern in T1 plants.<br>
GUS staining<br>
The sacrificed plants or plant parts were covered with 90% ice-cold acetone and incubated for 30<br>
min at 4 °C. After 3 washes of 5 min with Tris buffer [15,76 g Trizma HCI (Sigma T3253) + 2,922 g<br>
NaCI in 11 bidi, adjusted to pH 7,0 with NaOH], the material was covered by a Tris/ferricyanate/X -<br>
Glue solution [9,8 ml Tris buffer + 0,2 ml ferricyanate stock (0,33 g Potassium ferricyanate (Sigma<br>
P3667) in 10 ml Tris buffer}* 0,2 ml X -Glue stock (26,1 mg X-Gluc (Europa Byproducts ML 113A)<br>
in 500 ul DMSO)]. Vacuum infiltration was applied for 15 to 30 minutes. The plants or plant parts<br>
were incubated for up to 16 hours at 37 °C until development of blue colour was visible. The<br>
samples were washed 3 times for 5 minutes with Tris buffer. Chlorophyll was extracted in ethanol<br>
series of 50%, 70% and 90% (each for 30 minutes).<br>

Example 4. Stability of the expression patterns of the promoters of the present<br>
invention in further generations<br>
The above-mentioned analyses were performed on TO plants originating from the transformed<br>
tissues. The stability of promoter activity in the next generations or progeny plants of the original<br>
TO plant, the so-called T1 and T2 plants, was evaluated as follows. The TO plant transformed with<br>
the reporter constructs as mentioned in the above paragraphs of Example 2, were grown until<br>
maturity (A plants), of which the seeds (T1 seeds) were harvested and sown to generate progeny<br>
T1 plants. These plants were analysed as described above in Example 3 and the A T1 plants<br>

The expression pattern of the promoters of the present invention was studied in TO plants, T1<br>
seeds, T1 plants and T2 seeds and in all the tissues (Including seeds and seed tissues ) as<br>
described in Example 3. The specific expression pattern s as reported from the TO and T1 seeds<br>
and described in Example 3 were confirmed in the following T1 generation and T2 seeds . It is<br>
concluded that the expression pattern of the promoter s of the present are stably inherited in plants<br>
of subsequent generations.<br>
Examples. Stability of expression patterns of the promoters of the present<br>
invention In other plants<br>
The above-mentioned plant analyses were performed on rice plants. This choice was based on<br>
the practical consideration that plant genetic engineering is most profitable for crop plants. Also in<br>
other crop plants, such as for example Zea Mays, the reporter constructs comprising the<br>
promoters according to the present i nvention are introduced and transformed plant are evaluated<br>
as described hereinabove. The expression patterns of the promoters according to the present<br>
invention are conserved among plants. Therefore, the promoters according to the present<br>
invention are also suitable for driving and/or regulating expression of an operably linked nucleic<br>
acid in monocots, such as com.<br>
For many other purposes such as research and horticulture, (small) herbs are being genetically<br>
modified, which involves the use of promoters. Therefore the reporter constructs comprising the<br>
promoters according to the present invention are introduced into other plants species such as for<br>
example Arabidopsis thaliana and transformed plants are evaluated as described herein above.<br>
The expression patterns of the promoters according to the present invention are conserved<br>
among plants. Therefore, the promoters according to the present invention are also suitable for<br>
driving and/or regulating expression of a n operably linked nucleic acid in other plant species such<br>
as for example dicots, such as Arabidopsis.<br><br><br><br>
