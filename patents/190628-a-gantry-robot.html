				<td>This invention relates to a Gantry Robot.<br>
The manufacturing activities in an industry involves metal forming such as bending and rolling, metal cutting such as lathe, milling and boring. Fabrication such as various types of welding. Material handling such as loading and unloading of materials and components to a machine is done by the operator himself if it is within his capacity. Heavier components are handled by the operator with the assistance of a helper. Further heavier components are handled by providing a manually operated mechanical or an electrical hoist to each such machine. Sometime the overhead crane of the shop is used for loading and unloading of materials from machines.<br>
In the past, such machines were multipurpose, manual and was very slow.   So time taken including handling of material was not a matter of concern.<br>
But now with  the advent  of  operations research<br>
and  its application in manufacturing Industries for improvement of productivity it became very<br>
important to  reduce labour  and  time  wasted in handling  material.  Coupled  with this, with<br>
the development of  computer  saw  its  application in  metal  working  machines,  particularly special purpose machine  adapted  to  produce  a  single job respectively    in  the  form  of  CNC (Computer Numerical Control).  Such  machines   became very sophisticated in  terms   of-higher  productivity and was  very  costly.   Whereas  the entire<br>
operations  are  done  automatically  what  is<br>
still  being  done  manually  is  loading positioning and unloading  of  the  material  or  components in such machines.   Thus  the  machines  are  kept  idle for  considerable  time  and  is  an  area  of concern.<br>
For this purpose and for  loading,	unloading<br>
of job  to  a  machine  and  for movement  from<br>
machine  to  storage   area  an  overhead	electric<br>
gantry  crane  is  used.   These  cranes  have<br>
three axis movement/ X, Y and Z direction and all movements are  operated  with a  motor.   The crane is operated manually by an operator from a cab at one end of the crane. In very exceptional case, as in  a  hazardous process shop, the crane can have dual control with  remote operation through radio.<br>
These  cranes are  not very accurate and cannot  position  jobs  in machines  for automatic operation.  Invariably the  operator has to adjust and  set the job manually which takes considerable time.<br>
Therefore an object of  the  present invention is   to  propose a  gantry robot  for  handling of materials  to  process in  the  processing machines particularly  CNC  machines  to  reduce idle  time  and  increase   in  tool  engagement time.<br>
Another  object of the   present   invention is  to   propose  a  gantry  robot   for  CNC machine which  is  exclusive    and  integral  with   the machine.    Thus  the  other  common  handling facilities  like  overhead  cranes  etc.  are  free<br>
According to this invention there is provided a gantry robot comprising a manipulator having a gripper secured therewith being mounted on a pair girders secured at the top ends of the columns, an AC servo motor being mounted onto said column such that to provide motions to said manipulator and gripper, a controller is provided with a teach box facility for controlling the operation of said manipulator and gripper, means are provided for external interlocks for system integration, safety in operation and process specific coordination.<br>
In accordance with this invention the Gantry Robot has four axis manipulator<br>
provided with hydraulic gripper secured with the manipulator. AC servo motors<br>
having input/output conveyors are provided for providing motion to the manipulator<br>
and hydraulic gripper. The controller is provided with a teach box facility to<br>
control the movements of the manipulator and the gripper. Means are provided for<br>
external interlocking for system integration, safety in operation and process specific<br>
coordination. The manipulator is provided such that to have motion in the X-axis<br>
and Y-axis so as to cover the area of the work center. It has a Z traverse to lift/pick<br>
the work piece	<br>
to do respective job with consistent and improved productivity.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a gantry robot for offering user friendly operator interface, programming language and user file handling under the Gross (Gantry robot operating system Software) resident in an Industrial PC and closed loop position control of AC servo motors under the axis controllers which is a reliable and predictable throughput.<br>
Still another object of the present invention is to provide an automated system of loading, positioning and unloading of work piece on machines which relieves labour fatigue considerably and increases machine utilization and is very precision in positioning jobs on the machine.<br>
and  place  them on the  work  centre  or discharge station.   The  Z slide carries the gripper for  automatic  loading   and  unloading  of  work pieces.   The  gripper  is  mounted on  a   rotary mounting  which  facilitate  indexing  to keep the work  piece  in  desired  orientation.  The input and output  chain  conveyors  are  provided  for loading  the  work  piece  at a define location and  for  moving  the  work  piece  away  from the work  position.<br>
