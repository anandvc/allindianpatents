				<td>The subject invention pertains to ethylene polymer compositions  hich are useful in film applications.  In particular, -he subject invention pertains to ethylene polymer compositions  hich exhibit the processability of highly branched low density polyethylene, wile exhibiting improved mechanical properties, and to films prepared therefrom.<br>
His-cortically speaking, highly branched low density polyethylene has found great utility in blown film applications, attributable in part to its unique processabilicy.  Large amounts of long chain branching and a broad molecular weight distribution give this polymer the shear thinning and  elt strength properties unmatched by heterogeneously branched linear low density polyethylene resins.  Non-::Estonian shear thinning provides the high shear, low melt viscrsity for good extruder processability and low shear, high -elt viscosity for superior blow film bubble stability.<br>
Low density polyethylene has found utility in a variety of film applications.  Markets which require a combination cz high processability resins, but do not require high film clarity, include industrial liners, heavy duty shipping sacks, non-clarity rack and counter bags, mulch film, and rubber separators.  Markets which require a combination of high processaDility resins and high clarity films include clarity liners, bakery films, shrink films, and garment bags.<br>
The performance requirements vary depending upon the application, but include elements of (1) the polymer "extrudabilit-y" (high shear rheology) and melt strength (low shear rheology); (2) mechanical properties of the fabricated article; and  3) optical properties of the fabricated article. The actual performance requirements are given in terms of (1) the film bubble stability, polymer output rate (kg/hr) and<br><br>
extruder periDrmance (pressure, melt temperature and motor amperes); ,2} strength of the fabricated article (such as tensiles, resistance to tear, resistance to puncture); and (3) clarity, haze and gloss of the fabricated article.<br>
Heterogeneously branched ethylene/a-olefin interpolyrr.ers , which are referred to in industry as linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE), have likewise found utility in blown film applications.  In many respects, such resins are preferred to low density polyethylene, as they lead to blown films exhibiting tear and toughnes__pr.Dp.ertaes.  However, such polymers are -.ore difficult to process and have decreased optical properties, such as haze and clarity, than films prepared v;ith highly branched low density polyethylene.<br>
In developing markets, demand for polyolefins which exhibit the processability of low density polyethylene is growing.  However, the demand is currently outpacing the investment in new low density polyethylene plants.  The industry v.-ould find advantage in olefin polymer compositions which are useful to prepare blown films which have toughness and impact prcperties comparable to heterogeneously branched "^^ l ethylene/alpha-olefin interpolymers, which exhibit the processabilit\" and optical properties of highly branched low t i-"" ■"" density polyethylene.  Preferably, such polymer compositions would be produced in low pressure solution, slurry, or gas phase poiynerization reactions.<br>
U.S. Patent Wo. 5,539,076 discloses a particulate polymer compcsition which is an in  situ  catalytically produced blend having a broad bimodal molecular weight distribution. Molecular weight distributions of 2.5 to 60 are broadly claimed, v;ith molecular weight distributions of 10 to 50 being preferred, and of 15 to 30 being most preferred.<br>

135""C. A polyrr.er having an I21/I2 of 18 and an 1^/Mn of 2.6 is exemplified.<br>
U.S. Patent Wo. 4,205,021 discloses a copolymer of ethylene and = C5-Cig a-olefin, which copolymer has a density of from 0.90 "o 0.94 g/cm^.  The disclosed compositions are said to have long chain branching, and are described as preferably having two or more DSC melting points.  U.S. 4,205,021 discloses the use of the disclosed polymers in blown films.<br>
U.S. Serial No. 08/858,684 (PCT Publication WO 93/13,143), discloses the in-situ  preparation of a blend of two ethylene poli.—.ers prepared with a constrained geometry catalyst, wherein each of the polymers is said to have a melt index (I2) of from 0.05 to 50 g/10 minutes.  The polymers may be prepared in a single reactor with two active catalyst species, or rr.ay be produced in a dual reactor configuration with either the same or different constrained geometry catalysts being provided in each reactor.<br>
The industry would find advantage in olefin polymer compositions ■.■;hich will usefully replace high pressure low density polyethylene, without requiring film fabricators to engage in significant reconstruction and retrofitting of their fabrication l^nes.  The desired olefin polymer compositions should have crocessability and optical properties which are at least roughl\- equivalent to that of highly branched low density polyethylene.  Preferably, the desired olefin polymer compositions ■.■rill further exhibit toughness and impact properties wh:Lch are improved over the properties of low density polyethylene-  Preferably, such polymer compositions will be produced in low pressure solution, slurry, or gas phase polymerization reactions.<br>

FIGVRE 3 is a diagrammatic representation of the calculation ci Crystallization Temperature Breadth Index, CTBI, for a general crystallization peak occurring in a Temperature Rising Eluzicn Fractionation, TREF, analysis. Test Methods<br>
Unless c-herwise indicated, the following procedures are employed:<br>
Densizy is measured in accordance with ASTM D-792.  The samples are annealed at ambient conditions for 24 hours before the measurement is taken.<br>
Melt index (I2)" is measured in accordance with ASTM D-<br>
1238, condition 190°C/2.16 kg (formally known as "Condition<br>
(E) ") .<br><br>
Iio/ is -easured in accordance with ASTM D-1238, Condition 190°C/10 kg (formerly known as "Condition N").<br>
Molecular weight is determined using gel permeation chromatograph;.- (GPC) on a Waters 150°C  high temperature chromatographic unit equipped with three mixed porosity columns (Polymer Labcratories 10\ 10^, 10\ and 10^), operating at a system temperature of 140°C.  The solvent is 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene, from which 0.14 percent by weight solutions of the samples are prepared for injection.  The flow rate is 1.0 raL/min. ar.d the injection size is 100 microliters.<br>
The mole~ular weight determination is deduced by using narrow molecular weight distribution polystyrene standards (from Polymer Laboratories) in conjunction with their elution volumes.  The equivalent polyethylene molecular weights are determined by using appropriate Mark-Houwink coefficients for polyethylene 5Lnd polystyrene {as described by Williams and Word in Journal of Polymer Science, Polymer Letters, Vol. 6, (621) 1968) to derive the following equation:<br>
^polyethylene ^  ^   *    (^polystyrene"^•<br>
In this equation, a = 0.4316 and b = 1.0.  Weight average molecular weight, M^, is calculated in the usual manner<br>
according to -he following formula; M^ = I.  Wj_* M-i_, where w^ and M-L are the weight fraction and molecular weight, respectively, of the ith fraction eluting from the GPC column.<br>
Melting temperature, crystallization temperature, and percent crystallinity are determined using differential scanning calcrimetry (DSC).  Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) data was generated by placing each sample (5 mg) in an aluminum pan, the sample was heated to 160°C, cooled at 10°C/min and "he endotherm was recorded by scanning from -30""C to 140°C at i;=C/min using a Perkin Elmer DSC 7.  The DSC<br><br>
exotherm (coding curve) was also recorded by scanning from 140<br>
to -30 at 10=C min.<br>
Percent   :zrystallinity  is   calculated with   the   equation:<br>
%C-[A/292   J/g)   x   100,<br>
in which %C represents the percent crystallinity and A represents the heat of fusion of the ethylene in Joules per gram (J/g) as determined by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) .<br>
Haze is -easured in accordance with ASTM D-1003.<br>
Elmendorf tear is determined in accordance with ASTM D1922.<br>
Tensile strength and toughness are determined in accordance with ASTM D638.<br>
45° gloss is measured in accordance with ASTM D2457.<br>
Dart impact (A, B) is measured in accordance with ASTM D-<br>
1709<br>
Percent elongation is measured in accordance with ASTM D-<br>
882.<br>
Clarity is measured in accordance with ASTM D-1746.<br>
The terrr. " interpolymer" is used herein to indicate a copolymer, or a Cerpolymer, or a higher order polymer.  That is, at least me other comonomer is polymerized with ethylene to make the interpolymer.<br>
The ethylene/a-olefin interpolymer used in the films of the present invention is preferably a homogeneous linear or substantially linear ethylene/a-olefin interpolymer.  By the term "homogeneous", it is meant that any comonomer is randomly distributed xithin a given interpolymer molecule and substantially all of the interpolymer molecules have the same ethylene/comcr-omer ratio within that interpolymer.  The melting peak of homogeneous linear and substantially linear ethylene polymers, as obtained using differential scanning calorimetry, will broaden as the density decreases and/or as the number<br><br>
average molecular weight decreases.  However, unlike heterogeneous polymers, when a homogeneous polymer which has been prepared in a solution polymerization process has a melting peak greater than 115°C (such as is the case of polymers having a density greater than 0.940 g/cm^), it does not additionally have a distinct lower temperature melting peak.<br>
In addition or in the alternative, the homogeneity of the constituents of the interpolymer may be described by the Crystallisation Temperature Breadth Index, CTBI.  CTBI can be measured from data obtained from techniques known in the art, such as, for example, temperature rising elution fractionation (abbreviated herein as "TREF"), which is described, for example, in vrild et al. , Journal of Polymer Science, Poly. Phys. Ed., Vcl. 20, p. 441 (1982), in U.S. Patent 4,798,081 {Hazlitt eo al] .     An example of how one obtains the CTBI for a given crystallization peak in the TREF experiment is shown in Figure 3.  The calculation is applied only to individual, distinct crystallization peaks in the TREF analysis.  The TREF data may he ceconvoluted prior to the calculation.  The calculation consists of:  (1) measuring the height of the crystallisait:n peak in question; then (2) measuring the width of the pea:-: at one-half the height.  The value is reported in °C.  The CTBI for the homogeneous ethylene/a-olefin interpolyir.ers useful in the invention is less than 18°C , preferably less than 15°C .  A CTBI value of less than 10°C  is<br>
attainable.<br>
The homogeneous ethylene interpolymer useful in the practice cf the invention will preferably have an M„ /M,, of from 1.5 to 3.5, more preferably from 1.7 to 3.0.  It is noted that in the ezibodiment of the invention which comprises an in-reaction cr physical blend of two homogeneous polymers, the overall compcsition may have an M„/Mn of greater than 3.5, although the individual components will have an Mv,/Mn in the narrower ranee recited ?ihov(=<br><br>
Linear ethylene interpolymers are interpolymers characterized as having an interpolymer backbone substituted with less than 0.01 long chain branches per 1000 carbons. Substantially linear ethylene interpolymers are interpolymers characterized as having an interpolymer backbone substituted with from O.Cl to 3 long chain branches per 1000 carbons. Due to the presence of such long chain branching, substantially linear ethylene interpolymers are further characterized as having a melt flow ratio {I10/I2) which may be varied independently of the polydispersity index, referred to alternatively as the molecular weight distribution or M„/Mn. This feature accords substantially linear ethylene polymers with a high degree of processability despite a narrow molecular weight distribution,<br>
It 13 noted that the linear and substantially linear interpolymers useful in the invention differ from low density polyethylene prepared in a high pressure process.  In one regard, whereas low density polyethylene is an ethylene homopolymer having a density of from 0.915 to 0.935 g/cm\ the homogeneous linear and substantially linear interpolymers useful in the invention require the presence of a comonomer to reduce the density to the range of from 0.900 to 0.935 g/cm^.<br>
The long chain branches of substantially linear ethylene interpolymers have the same comonomer distribution as the interpol\—.er backbone and can be as long as about the same length as the length of the interpolymer backbone.  In the preferred embodiment, wherein a substantially linear ethylene/a-olefin interpolymer is employed in the practice of the invention, such interpolymer will be more preferably be characterized as having an interpolymer backbone substituted with from O.Cl to 3 long chain branches per 1000 carbons.<br>
Methods for determining the amount of long chain branching present, both qualitatively and quantitatively, are known in the art.<br><br>
For qualitative methods for determining the presence of long chain branching, see, for example, U.S. Patent Nos. 5,272,236 and 5,278,272.  As set forth therein, a gas extrusion rheometer (GE?.) may be used to determine the rheological processing index (PI), the critical shear rate at the onset of surface melt fracture, and the critical shear stress at the onset of gross melt fracture, which in turn indicate the presence or absence of long chain branching as set forth below.<br>
The gas extrusion rheometer useful in the determination of rheological processing index (PI), the critical shear rate at the onset of surface melt fracture, and the critical shear stress at the onset of gross melt fracture, is described by M. Shida, R. N. Shroff, and L. V. Cancio in Polymer Engineering Science, Vol. 17, No. 11, p. 770 (1977), and in "Rheorr.eters for Molten Plastics" by John Dealy, published by Van Nostrand Reinhold Co. (1982) on pp. 97-99. GER experimen-s are performed at a temperature of 190°C, at nitrogen pressures between 250 and 5500 psig {between 1.72 and 37.9 MPa) using a 0.0754 mm diameter, 20:1 L/D die with an entrance angle of 180°.<br>
For substantially linear ethylene interpolymers, the PI is the apparent viscosity (in kpoise) of a material measured by GER at an apparent shear stress of 2.15 x 10^ dynes/cm^ (0.215 MPa). Substantially linear ethylene interpolymers useful in the invencz-on will have a PI in the range of 0.01 Icpoise to 50 Jcpoise, preferably 15 kpoise or less.  Substantially linear ethylene in.terpolymers have a PI which is less than or equal to 70 percent of the PI of a linear ethylene interpolymer (either a Ziegler pol-_.-merized polymer or a homogeneous linear ethylene interpolymer  having the same comonomer or comonomers, and having an I;, M^/Mn, and density, each of which is within 10 percent of that of the substantially linear ethylene interpolymer.<br>
An apparent shear stress versus apparent shear rate plot may be used to identify the melt fracture phenomena and to<br><br>
quantify the ::ritical shear rate and critical shear stress of ethylene polyr-.ers.  According to Ramamurthy, in the Journal of Rheology, 30(2", 1986, pages 337-357, above a certain critical flow rate, the observed extrudate irregularities may be broadly classified in-o two main types:  surface melt fracture and gross melt fracture.<br>
Surface melt fracture occurs under apparently steady flow conditions and ranges in detail from loss of specular film gloss to the ~ore severe form of "sharkskin."  Herein, as determined using the above-described gas extrusion rheometer, the onset of surface melt fracture is characterized as the beginning of losing extrudate gloss at which the surface roughness of "he extrudate can only be detected by magnification at 40 times.  The critical shear rate at the onset of surface melt fracture for a substantially linear ethylene interpolymer is at least 50 percent greater than the critical shear rate at the onset of surface melt fracture for a linear ethylene polymer having the same comonomer or comonomers and having an I2, 1%/Mr, and density within ten percent of that of the substantially linear ethylene polymer.<br>
Gross melt fracture occurs at unsteady extrusion flow conditions and ranges from regular (alternating rough and smooth, helical, etc.) to random distortions.  The critical shear stress at the onset of gross melt fracture of substantially linear ethylene interpolymers, especially those having a density greater than 0.910 g/cm^, is greater than 4 x 10^ dynes/cm-  0.4 MPa).<br>
The presence of long chain branching may further be qualitatively determined by the Dow Rheology Index (DRI), which expresses a polymer"s "normalized relaxation time as the result of long chain branching."  [See, S. Lai and G. W. Knight, ANTEC "93 Proceedings, INSITE™ Technology Polyolefins (SLEP)- New Rules in the Structure/Rheology Relationship of Ethylene a-Olefin Copol\—ers. New Orleans, La., May 1993.  DRI values range from 0 for polymers which do not have any measurable long<br><br>
chain branchir.g, such as Tafmer™ products available from Mitsui Petrochemical Industries and Exact™ products available from Exxon Chemical company) to 15, and are independent of melt index.  In general, for low to medium pressure ethylene polymers, par-icular at lower densities, DRI provides improved correlations "o melt elasticity and high shear flowability relative to correlations of the same attempted with melt flow ratios.  Substantially linear ethylene interpolymers will have a DRI of preferably at least 0.1, more preferably at least 0.5, and most preferably at least 0.8.<br>
DRI may be calculated from the equation: DRI - (3.652879 * lol. 00649/Tio-l)/lO where TO is the characteristic relaxation time of the interpolymer =nd Tio is the zero shear viscosity of the interpolymer.  Both TO and rjo are the "best fit" values to the Cross equaticr.:<br>
n/Tlo ^ 1/{1 + (Y * to)^"") in which n is ^he power law index of the material, and r\   and y are the measured viscosity and shear rate, respectively. Baseline determination of viscosity and shear rate data are obtained using a Rheometric Mechanical Spectrometer (I?MS-800) under dynamic sweep mode from 0.1 to 100 radians/second at 160° C and a gas extrusion rheometer (GER) at extrusion pressures from 1,000 to 5,000 psi (6.89 to 34.5 MPa), which corresponds to a shear stress of from 0.086 to 0.43 MPa, using a 0.0754 mm diameter, 20:1 L/D die at 190""C.  Specific material determinations may be performed from 140 to 190°C as required to accommodate melt index variations.<br>
For quantitative methods for determining the presence of long chain branching, see, for example, U.S. Patent Nos. 5,272,236 and 5,278,272; Randall (Rev. Macromol. Chem. Phys., 029 (2&amp;3), p. 285-297), which discusses the measurement of long chain branching using ^^C nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, Zimm, G.H. and Stockmayer, W.H., J. Chem. Phys.,<br><br>
17, 1301  1949); and Rudin, A., Modern Methods of Polymer Characterizat:Lon, John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York (1991} pages 103-112, which discuss the use of gel permeation chromatography coupled wi:^h a low angle laser light scattering detector (GPC-LALLS) and gel permeation chromatography coupled with a differential viscometer detector (GPC-DV).<br>
---. ".villem deGroot and P. Steve Chum, both of The Dow Chemical Company, at the October 4, 1994 conference of the Federation of Analytical Chemistry and Spectroscopy Society (FACSS) in St. Louis, Missouri, presented data demonstrating that GPC-DV is a useful technique for quantifying the presence of long chain branches in substantially linear ethylene polymers.  Ir. particular, deGroot and Chum found that in substantially linear ethylene polymers, the measured values for long chain branches obtained by this method correlated well with the level of long chain branches measured using ^^C NMR.<br>
Further, deGroot and Chum found that the presence of octane does not change the hydrodynamic volume of the polyethylene samples in solution and, as such, one can account for the molecular weight increase attributable to octene short chain branches by knowing the mole percent octene in the sample.  By deconvoluting the contribution to molecular weight increase attributable to 1-octene short chain branches, deGroot and Chum shov.-ed that GPC-DV may be used to quantify the level of long chain branches in substantially linear ethylene/octene copolymers.<br>
deGroot and Chum also showed that a plot of log(l2, melt index) as a function of log(GPC weight average molecular weight), as determined by GPC-DV, illustrates that the long chain branching aspects {but not the extent of long chain branching) of substantially linear ethylene polymers are comparable tc those of high pressure, highly branched low density polyethylene (LDPE) and are clearly distinct from heterogeneously branched ethylene polymers produced using Ziegler-type catalysts (such as linear low density polyethylene<br><br>
and ultra low density polyethylene) as well as from homogeneous linear ethylene polymers (such as Tafmer™ products available from Mitsui Petrochemical Industries and Exact™ products available frcr. Exxon Chemical Company) . ■<br>
Exer^.plary C3-C20 a-olefins used in the preparation of the ethylene interpolymers for use herein include propylene, isobutylene, 1-butene, 1-hexene, 4-methyl-l-pentene, 1-heptene, and 1-octene.  Preferred C3-C20 a-olefins include 1-butene, 1-hexene, 4-methyl-l-pentene, 1-heptene, and 1-octene, more preferably 1-hexene and 1-octene.  Exemplary cycloalkenes include cyclcpentene, cyclohexene, and cyclooctene. The dienes suitable as comonomers, particularly in the making of ethylene/ a-olefin/diene terpolymers, are typically non-conjugated dienes having from 6 to 15 carbon atoms.  Representative examples of suitable non-conjugated dienes include:<br>
(a)	Straight chain acyclic dienes such as 1,4-hexadiene; 1,5-heptadier.e; and 1, 6-octadiene;<br>
(b)	Branched chain acyclic dienes such as 5-methyl-l,4-hexadiene; 3,7-dimethyl-1,6-octadiene; and 3 , 7-dimethy1-1,7-octadiene;<br>
(c)	Single ring alicyclic dienes such as 4-vinylcyclohexene; l-allyl-4-isopropylidene cyclohexane; 3-allylcyclopentene; 4-allylcv-clohexene; and l-isopropenyl-4-butenylc"_;"clohexene; and<br>
(d)	Multi-ring alicyclic fused and bridged ring dienes such as dicyclopentadiene; alkenyl-, alkylidene-, cycloalkenyl-, and cycl::alkylidene-substituted norbornenes, such as 5-methylene-2-norbornene; 5-methylene-6-methyl-2-norbornene; 5-methylene-6,6-dimethyl-2-norbornene; 5-propenyl-2-norbornene; 5-(3-cyclopentenyl)-2-norbornene; 5-ethylidene-2-norbornene; and 5-cyclohexylidene-2-norbornene.<br>
One preferred conjugated diene is piperylene.  The preferred dienes are selected from the group consisting of 1,4-hexadiene; di::yclopentadiene; 5 -ethylidene-2-norbornene; 5 -<br><br>
methylene-2-n-rbornene; 7-methyl-l,6 octadiene; piperylene; and 4-vinylcyclohexene.<br>
The linear or substantially linear ethylene interpolymer preferably is an interpolymer of ethylene with, at least one C3-C1; a-olefin comonomer.<br>
While nor wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that the compositions useful in the practice of the claimed invention owe zheir improved toughness and impact properties at least in part -o the presence of tie molecules.  A tie chain is that portion rf the polyethylene chain which is expelled from the lEimellar crystal due to a short-chain branch imperfection. See, for instance, S. Krimm and T. C. Cheam, Faraday Discuss., Volume 68, pare 244 (1979); P. H. Geil, Polymer Single Crystals, published by Wiley, Inc., New York (1963); and P. J. Flory, J. ?^   rnem. Soc., Volume 84, page 2837 (1962).  This expelled chain can then be reincorporated into another crystal, connecting the two crystals together.  As the short chain branching increases, more tie chains form until the segments between shore-chain branches are not long enough to fold.  In addition, cie chain concentration is proportional to molecular weight and car. be influenced by the type and amount of comonomer.<br>
The effectiveness of an a-olefin to produce tie chains is proportional to its molecular size.  For instance, 1-octene is a very efficient comonomer for promoting tie chain formation, as its hexyl group disrupts crystal formation more than the butyl or ethyl groups of hexene and butene comonomers, respectively. Accordingly, ethylene/octene polymer are believe to have higher levels of tie chains than copolymers of shorter chain comonomers, which is believed to lead to improved toughness. Hcj^ever, if the products are themselves produced in the gas phase or are targeted for competition with polymers produced in z"ne  gas phase, one will typically utilize a C4-C6 a-olefin as che comonomer.<br><br>

The foregoing complexes are disclosed in WO96/28480, which is equivalent tc USSN 08/610,647, filed March 4, 1996, and in USSN 08/768,518, filed December 18, 1996.<br>
Alumoxanes, especially methylalumoxane or triisobutylal-.iminum modified methylalumoxane are also suitable activators and may be used for activating the present metal complexes.<br>
The rr.olar ratio of metal complex: activating cocatalyst employed preferably ranges from 1 : 1000 to 2 ; 1, more preferably from 1 : 5 to 1.5 : 1, most preferably from 1 : 2 to 1:1.  In the preferred case in which a metal complex is activated by trispentafluorophenylborane and triisobutylal--iminum modified methylalumoxane, the titanium:borcn:aluminum molar ratio is typically from 1 : 10 : 50 to 1 : 0.5 : 0.1, most typically from 1:3:5.  A most preferred activating cocatalyst is trispentafluorophynylborane (FAB), optionally in combination with an alumoxane, the molar<br><br>
ratio of metal complex:FAB;alumoxane being from. 1:1:5 to 1:10:50.<br>
A suppor-, especially silica, alumina, or a polymer {especially poly{tetrafluoroethylene) or a polyolefin) may be employed, and desirably is employed when the catalysts are used in a gas phase or slurry polymerization process.  The support is preferably employed in an amount to provide a weight ratio of catalyst (based on metal):support from 1:100,000 to 1:10, more preferably from 1:50,000 to 1:20, and most preferably from 1:10,000 to 1:30.<br>
At all times, the individual ingredients as well as the recovered catalyst components must be protected from oxygen and moisture.  Therefore, the catalyst components and catalysts must be prepared and recovered in an oxygen and moisture free atmosphere.  Preferably, therefore, the reactions are performed in the presence of an dry, inert gas such as, for example, nitrogen.<br>
The pol\Tr.erization will preferably be conducted in a continuous polymerization process.  In a continuous process, ethylene, corr.cnomer, optionally solvent and diene, are continuously supplied to the reaction zone and polymer product continuously removed therefrom.<br>
In general, the first polymer may be polymerized at conditions fcr Ziegler-Natta or Kaminsky-Sinn type polymerizaticn reactions, that is, reactor pressures ranging from atmospheric to 35er0 atmospheres (355 MPa) .  The reactor temperature should be greater than SO^C, typically from 100°C to 250°C, and preferably from 100""C to 150°C, with temperatures at the higher end of the range, temperatures greater than 100°C favoring the formation of lower molecular weight polymers.<br>
In conjunction with the reactor temperature, the hydrogen:ethylene molar ratio influences the molecular weight of the polymer, with greater hydrogen levels leading to lower<br><br>
molecular v/eight polymers. The molar range of hydrogen: ethylene will typically range from 0.0:1 to 2.5:1.<br>
Generall\- the polymerization process is carried out at a pressure of from 10 to 1000 psi (70 to 7000 kPa), most preferably fr-m 400 to 800 psi (280 to 5500 kPa).  The polymerizacicn is generally conducted at a temperature of from 80 to 250=C, preferably from 90 to llO^C.   and most preferably from greater zhan 95°C to 140°C.<br>
In most polymerization reactions the molar ratio of catalyst :pol\-:r.erizable compounds employed is from 10-12:1 to 10-1:1, more preferably from 10-9:1 to 10-5:1.  Solution polymerizaricn conditions utilize a solvent for the respective components of the reaction.  Preferred solvents include mineral oils and the various hydrocarbons which are liquid at reaction temperatures.  Illustrative examples of useful solvents include alkanes such as pentane, iso-pentane, hexane, heptane, octane and nonane, as well as mixtures of allcanes including kerosene and Isopar-HP". available from Exxon Chemicals Inc. ; cycloalkanes such as cyclopentane and cyclohexane; and aromatics such as benzene, toluene, xylenes, ethylbenzene and diethylbenzene.<br>
The solvent will be present in an amount sufficient to prevent phase separation in the reactor.  As the solvent functions zo absorb heat, less solvent leads to a less adiabatic rea~ror.  The solvent:ethylene ratio (weight basis) in the feed v;ill typically be from 2.5:1 to 12:1, beyond which point catalys- efficiency suffers.  The most typical solvent:ethylene ratio (weight basis) in the feed is in the range of from 2.5:1 to 6:1.<br>
The erh\-lene/a-olefin interpolymer may alternatively be prepared in a gas phase polymerization process, using the catalysts as described above as supported in an inert support, such as silica.  The ethylene/a-olefin interpolymer may further be made in a slurry polymerization process, using the catalysts as described above as supported in an inert support.<br><br>
such as silica.  As a practical limitation, slurry polymerizaCicr.s take place in liquid diluents in which the polymer product is substantially insoluble.  Preferably, the diluent for slurry polymerization is one or more hydrocarbons with less thar. 5 carbon atoms.  If desired, saturated hydrocarbons such as ethane, propane or butane may be used in whole or part as the diluent.  Likewise the a-olefin monomer or a mixture of different a-olefin monomers may be used in whole or part as the diluent.  Most preferably the diluent comprises in at least rr.a j or part the a-olefin monomer or monomers to be polymerized.<br>
The pol\—.ers may be produced via a continuous (as opposed to a batch) crntrolled polymerization process using at least one reactor, but can also be produced using multiple reactors (for example, using a multiple reactor configuration as described in V.S. Patent No. 3,914,342 (Mitchell)), with the second ethylene polymer polymerized in at least one other reactor.  The multiple reactors can be operated in series or in parallel, witr. at least one constrained geometry catalyst employed in at least one of the reactors at a polymerization temperature ar.d pressure sufficient to produce the ethylene polymers having the desired properties.<br>
The mel- index of the polymer compositions useful in the present inven-ion will be chosen on the basis of the targeted end use appliration.  For instance, polymer compositions having a melt index -f at least 2 grams/10 minutes, preferably at least 3 grams 10 minutes; and preferably no more than 8 grams/10 minutes, preferably no more than 7 grams/10 minutes, will be usefully employed in general purpose blown film applications.<br>
Likewise, polymer compositions having a melt index of less than 1 gram/i: minutes, preferably less than 0.75 gram/10 minutes, will be usefully employed in heavy duty bags and other high strength film applications.<br><br>
Those films of the invention which are characterized as higher clarity films, will preferably be characterized as having a haze of less than 12 percent, preferably less than 11 percent, more preferably less than 10 percent.  For instance, exemplary of -he polymer compositions which lead to the<br>
production of such most preferred films, are the ethylene/a-olefin interpoiymers of the invention having a melt index of less than 1 gram/10 minutes, preferably less than 0.7 5 gram/10 minutes, and having an I10/I2 of at least 10, preferably at least 12.<br>
The compcsitions of the invention may optionally be melt-blended with z-her thermoplastic polymers, such as low density polyethylene. Linear low density polyethylene, high density polyethylene, ethylene vinyl acetate, ethylene vinyl alcohol, polypropylene, polycarbonate, and ethyiene/styrene interpoiymers, provided that the formation of such a blend does not deleteriously interfere with the desired performance. Typically, such an additional thermoplastic polymer will be provided to the blend in an amount offrom 1 to 30 weight percent, preferably from 1 to 15 weight percent.<br>
Certain ;f the compositions of the invention will be prepared in a dual reactor configuration in accordance with techniques knc^/m in the art.  For instance, dual reactor systems are disclosed and claimed in USSN 08/858664 {EP 619,827) and "3SJ:i  03/747,419 (?CT Publication WO 94/17112).<br><br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a film having at least one layer comprising a homogeneous interpolymer of ethylene and at least one comonomer selected from the group consisting of C3-C20 a-olefins, dienes, and cycloajkenes, wherein the interpolymer is characterized as having: a) a density of from 0.910 to 0.930 g/cm^ as measured according to the procedures of ASTM D792; b) a melt index (I2) of from 0.05 to 10 g/10 minutes, as measured according to procedures of ASTM D-1238, Condition 190""C/2.16 Kg formerly known as Condition E; c) an ho/li of from 9 to 20, with I]o measured according to the procedures of ASTM D-1238, Condition 190°C/\Q Kg formerly known as Condition N; d) a molecular weight distribution, Mn/Mn, of from 2.1 to 5 as measured using narrow molecular weight distribution polystyrene standards in conjunction with their elution volumes; and e) wherein the interpolymer is fiirther characterized as having a single crystallization peak between 45""C and 98""C and having a Crystallization Temperature Breadth hidex (CTBI) of less than IS^C, as determined by temperature rising elution fractionation (TRBF).<br>
