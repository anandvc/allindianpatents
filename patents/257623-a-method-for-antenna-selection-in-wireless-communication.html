				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention generally relates to wireless communication<br>
systems, and more particularly, to a method and apparatus for efficient<br>
measurements in utilizing a smart antenna in the wireless communication<br>
system.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
In a wireless local area network (WLAN), an access point (AP) and a<br>
station (8TA) may be equipped with smart antenna features; for example, a<br>
multiple beam/directional antenna system. Both the AP and the STA need to<br>
perform measurements to decide the best beam for transmitting to or receiving<br>
from another STA. STAs with multiple beams typically perform scanning on<br>
different beams in order to estimate which is the best beam to serve them.<br>
Scanning performed by the AP and/or STAs may use either a dummy packet, a<br>
data packet, an 802.11 acknowledgement (ACK), or broadcast packets. The<br>
measurements need to be updated frequently.<br>
At an AP, the beam switching algorithm uses packets from a STA<br>
for the antenna measurements. The best beam (based on the received packet<br>
measurements, e.g., a received power or signal to interference plus noise ratio<br>
(SINK)) is then used to transmit packets to that STA. At the STA, the current<br>
beam switching algorithm may use the data packet or beacon to decide the<br>
correct receive and transmit antenna/beam for that AP. This method for antenna<br>
measurement is not very efficient, due to the amount of time needed to obtain<br>
enough measurements to decide the correct beam for each STA.<br>
Another problem with this beam selection method is that the beam<br>
selection, for both receive and transmit, is based on measurements made on the<br>
received packets. However, in reality, the best beam for transmission might not<br>
be the same as the best beam for reception (especially for a frequency division<br>
duplex system).<br>
SUMMARY<br>
A method for taking measurements with a smart antenna in a<br>
wireless communication system having a plurality of STAs begins by sending a<br>
measurement request from a first STA to a second STA. At least two<br>
measurement packets are transmitted from the second STA to the first STA.<br>
Each measurement packet is received at the first STA using a different antenna<br>
beam. The first STA performs measurements on each measurement packet and<br>
selects an antenna beam direction based on the measurement results.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED<br>
EMBODIMENTS<br>
Hereafter, the term "station" (STA) includes, but is not limited to, a<br>
wireless transmit/receive unit, a user equipment, a fixed or mobile subscriber<br>
unit, a pager, or any other type of device capable of operating in a wireless<br>
environment. When referred to hereafter, the term "access point" (AP) includes,<br>
but is not limited to, a base station, a Node B, a site controller, or any other type<br>
of interfacing device in a wireless environment.<br>
i The present invention solves the problem of not having<br>
measurement support for smart antennas and may be implemented in an AP, a<br>
non-AP STA, or both. The present invention provides a signaling mechanism to<br>
obtain received signal strength indicator (RSSI) or SINR measurements for each<br>
transmit or receive antenna between any two stations. A mechanism to correctly<br>
update the received measurements between scanning is also provided.<br>
The present invention uses an action frame for antenna<br>
measurements by creating a new category of action frame called "Antenna<br>
Measurement". This category of action frame includes an action field for<br>
measurement request packets, measurement response packets, and dummy<br>
measurement packets. Action frames are currently defined in the WLAN<br>
standards (i.e., 802.11k, 802.lie). The measurement packets of the present<br>
invention can also be part of a separate control packet or a management packet.<br>
Figure 1 shows a measurement request packet 100 in accordance<br>
with the present invention. The measurement request packet 100 includes fields<br>
for the number of transmit or receive packets 102, transmit antenna information<br>
104, request type 106, and request for measurement report 108. The number of<br>
transmit or receive packets 102 depends on parameters such as the fading<br>
environment and the time to select an antenna. In one embodiment, a preferred<br>
value is 10 packets per antenna. The transmit antenna information 104 includes<br>
the antenna beam identity or any other information that can be used to identify<br>
an antenna or set of antennas. Two possible request types 106 will be explained<br>
hereinafter in connection with Figures 4 and 6. However, it is noted that there<br>
are many possible ways of sending measurements and getting the response that<br>
can be indicated in the request type field 106. The request for measurement<br>
report field 108 includes a parameter for SNR measurement and a parameter for<br>
RSSI measurement.<br>
Figure 2 shows a measurement packet 200 in accordance with the<br>
present invention. The measurement packet 200 includes antenna identity<br>
information 202 and sequence number of the current packet 204. The antenna<br>
identity information 202 includes the antenna beam identity or any other<br>
element that can be used to identify an antenna or set of antennas.<br>
Figure 3 shows a measurement report packet 300 in accordance with<br>
the present invention. The measurement report packet 300 includes sequence<br>
information 302 (the sequence number of the packet), antenna information 304<br>
(i.e., antenna identity information), the measured RSSI value 306, and the<br>
measured SNR value 308.<br>
The measurement request and response can be initiated by the STA<br>
or the AP. The measurement request packet 100 and the measurement response<br>
packet 300 may be sent anytime while the STA is associated to the AP. The STA<br>
may be allowed to use these techniques of measuring the signal from each<br>
antenna and to each antenna before associating to the AP.<br>
Figure 4 is a flowchart of a method 400 for measurement packet<br>
exchange between two STAs, STA1 and STA2, in accordance with a first<br>
embodiment of the present invention. The method 400 begins with STA1 sending<br>
a measurement request packet to STA2 (step 402). STA2 receives the<br>
measurement request packet (step 404) and sends an ACK to STA1 (step 406).<br>
STA2 then transmits a measurement packet to STA1 (step 408). STA1 receives<br>
the measurement packet and measures the RSSI and/or the SNR of the<br>
measurement packet (step 410). A determination is made if all of the packets, as<br>
specified in the measurement request packet, have been transmitted (step 412).<br>
If all of the packets have not been transmitted, then STA1 changes<br>
its receive beam (step 414). 8TA2 waits for a short interframe space (SIFS; step<br>
416) before transmitting the next packet (step 408). In a preferred embodiment,<br>
STA2 waits for the SIFS; however, the wait time can vary and be either more or<br>
less than the SIFS. The variable nature of the wait period relates to the length of<br>
time needed to switch antenna beams, the accuracy of the system clock, and any<br>
other implementation-specific timing issues. If all of the packets have been<br>
transmitted (step 412), then STA1 selects the transmit beam based on all of the<br>
measured RSSI and/or the SNR values (step 418) and the method terminates<br>
(step 420).<br>
Figure 5 is a signal diagram of the method 400, showing the packet<br>
exchange between STA1 502 and STA2 504. STA1 502 sends a measurement<br>
request packet 506 to STA2 504. STA2 504 waits for a SIFS 508 before sending<br>
an ACK 510 in response to the measurement request packet 506. STA2 504 then<br>
sends multiple measurement packets 512i ... 512n consecutively, each<br>
measurement packet 512 being separated by a SIFS 514. During the SIFS, STA1<br>
502 changes its receive beam, such that each of the packets 5121 ... 512n is<br>
received on a different beam. STA1502 then uses the received signal strength of<br>
each packet 512 to select the correct beam.<br>
Figure 6 is a flowchart of a method 600 for measurement packet<br>
exchange between two STAs, STA1 and STA2, in accordance with a second<br>
embodiment of the present invention. The method 600 begins with STA1 sending<br>
a measurement request packet to STA2 (step 602). STA2 receives the<br>
measurement request packet (step 604) and sends an ACK to STA1 (step 606).<br>
STA1 sends a measurement packet from a beam (step 608). STA2 receives the<br>
measurement packet and measures the RSSI and/or the SNR of the packet (step<br>
610). A determination is made whether all of the measurement packets specified<br>
by the measurement request packet have been transmitted (step 612). If all of the<br>
measurement packets have not been transmitted, the STA1 changes the transmit<br>
beam (step 614), waits for a 8IF8 (step 616), and sends a packet from the new<br>
beam (step 608). In a preferred embodiment, STA1 waits for the SIFS; however,<br>
the wait time can vary and be either more or less than the SIFS. The variable<br>
nature of the wait period relates to the length of time needed to switch antenna<br>
beams, the accuracy of the system clock, and any other implementation-specific<br>
timing issues.<br>
If all of the measurement packets have been transmitted (step 612),<br>
then STA2 generates a measurement report based on all of the received<br>
measurement packets (step 620). STA2 sends the measurement report to STA1<br>
(step 622) and STA1 sends an ACK to STA2 for the measurement report (step<br>
624). STA1 selects a transmit beam based on the measurement report (step 626)<br>
and the method terminates (step 628).<br>
Figure 7 is a signal diagram of the method 600, showing the packet<br>
exchange between STA1 702 and STA2 704. STA1 702 sends a measurement<br>
request packet 706 to STA2 704. STA2 704 waits for a SIFS 708 before sending<br>
an ACK 710 in response to the measurement request packet 706. STA1702 waits<br>
for a SIFS 712 before sending a measurement packet 714i... 714n from a beam to<br>
STA2 704. Each measurement packet 714 is sent from a different beam, and<br>
STA1 702 waits for a SIFS 716 before sending a measurement packet 714 on<br>
another beam. STA2 704 receives the measurement packets 714 and measures<br>
each packet. After all of the measurement packets 714 have been received by<br>
STA2 704, STA2 704 generates a measurement report packet 718 and sends it to<br>
STA1 702. STA1 702 then sends an ACK to STA2 704 upon receipt of the<br>
measurement report packet 718. STA1 702 then selects a beam direction in<br>
accordance with the measurement report packet 718.<br>
The measurement request and report information can be<br>
piggybacked on a data packet, a management packet, or a control packet.<br>
Physical layer signaling can be sent from different beams. This signaling can be<br>
sent such that it identifies different beams through some physical layer signature<br>
(such as a preamble) or beam information. These measurement signals can be<br>
sent in one packet (without waiting for a SIFS).<br>
Passive measurement to update the received signal strength is also<br>
possible. The received signal strength from a transmitter may change based on<br>
the switched beam or the diversity techniques. A receiver may end up making<br>
inaccurate decisions on the correct beam for reception (or transmission) in the<br>
absence of any notification about the antenna usage of the transmitter node. The<br>
transmitted packet contains the beam identity or diversity method indication.<br>
This information can be used by the receiver to update the received measurement<br>
information.<br>
The transmit antenna information is sent immediately after the<br>
physical layer convergence protocol (PLOP) header or in the medium access<br>
control (MAC) header. The information can be a pre-defined signal pattern<br>
indicating an omni-directional beam or antenna beam identity. The pattern can<br>
also be used to indicate diversity technique (if any).<br>
Figure 8 is a diagram of a PLCP frame format 800 in accordance<br>
with the present invention. The PLCP frame 800 includes a preamble 802, a<br>
signal field 804, a header error check (HEC) 806, and a physical layer service<br>
data unit (PSDU) 810. The present invention adds a new field to the PLCP frame<br>
800, a transmit/receive antenna identifier 808. Backward compatibility is<br>
maintained by adding transmit antenna information after the PLCP header. An<br>
additional information field may also be included in the MAC header to indicate<br>
the transmit antenna identity.<br>
The present invention provides an efficient method to measure<br>
signal strength to/from a beam or directional antenna. The current 802.11<br>
standards have no defined method for antenna measurement. The use of dummy<br>
packets or beacons is inefficient and tune consuming. Also, it limits the use of a<br>
directional antenna in fading environments and roaming. The present invention<br>
allows a STA to use different beams for transmission and reception.<br>
Figure 9 is a diagram of a system 900 configured to communicate<br>
measurement information in accordance with the methods 400 and 600, as<br>
described above in connection with Figures 4 and 6, respectively. The system 900<br>
includes a first STA (STA 1) 902 and a second STA (STA 2) 904. While the system<br>
900 is shown as two separate STAs for purposes of discussion, each STA can be<br>
constructed with all of the components shown.<br>
The first STA 902 includes a measurement packet request device<br>
910 connected to a transmitter/receiver 912, which is connected to an antenna<br>
914. A measurement packet transmit device 916 is connected to the<br>
measurement packet request device 910 and the transmitter/receiver 912. A<br>
measurement packet analysis device 918 is connected to the transmitter/receiver<br>
912. A beam change device 920 is connected to the transmitter/receiver 912, the<br>
measurement packet transmit device 916, and the measurement packet analysis<br>
device 918. A measurement report analysis device 922 is connected to the<br>
transmitter/receiver 912 and the beam change device 920.<br>
The second STA 904 includes an antenna 930 connected to a<br>
transmitter/receiver 932. A measurement packet request receive device 934 is<br>
connected to the transmitter/receiver 932. A measurement packet transmit device<br>
936 is connected to the transmitter/receiver 932 and the measurement packet<br>
request receive device 934. A measurement packet analysis device 938 is<br>
connected to the transmitter/receiver 932. A measurement report generating<br>
device 940 is connected to the transmitter/receiver 932 and the measurement<br>
packet analysis device 938.<br>
When implementing the method 400, the system 900 is configured to<br>
operate as follows. The measurement packet request device 910 generates a<br>
measurement packet request, which is sent to transmitter/receiver 912 for<br>
transmission to the second STA 904. The transmitter/receiver 932 receives the<br>
measurement packet request and forwards it to the measurement packet request<br>
receive device 934. The measurement packet request receive device 934 generates<br>
an ACK which is sent to the first STA 902.<br>
After sending the ACK, the measurement packet request receive<br>
device 934 signals the measurement packet transmit device 936 to begin sending<br>
measurement packets to the first STA 902. When measurement packets are<br>
received at the first STA 902, the transmitter/receiver 912 forwards the<br>
measurement packets to the measurement packet analysis device 918, where the<br>
RSSI and/or SNR of the measurement packet is measured. If all of the requested<br>
measurement packets have not been received, the measurement packet analysis<br>
device 918 signals the beam change device 920 to change the receive beam of the<br>
first 3TA 902 to receive additional measurement packets.<br>
If all of the requested measurement packets have been received, the<br>
measurement packet analysis device selects an appropriate transmit beam based<br>
on the previously measured values and then signals a selected transmit beam to<br>
the beam change device 920.<br>
When implementing the method 600, the system 900 is configured to<br>
operate as follows. The measurement packet request device 910 generates a<br>
measurement packet request, which is sent to transmitter/receiver 912 for<br>
transmission to the second STA 904. The transmitter/receiver 932 receives the<br>
measurement packet request and forwards it to the measurement packet request<br>
receive device 934. The measurement packet request receive device 934 generates<br>
an ACK which is sent to the first STA 902.<br>
Upon receipt of the ACK, the measurement packet request device<br>
910 signals the measurement packet transmit device 916 to begin transmitting<br>
measurement packets to the second STA 904. Upon receipt of a measurement<br>
packet, the transmitter/receiver 932 forwards the measurement packet to the<br>
measurement packet analysis device 938 where the packet is measured. If all of<br>
the requested measurement packets have not been transmitted, the<br>
measurement packet transmit device 916 signals the beam change device 918 to<br>
change the transmit beam prior to sending the next measurement packet.<br>
If all of the requested measurement packets have been transmitted,<br>
then the measurement report generating device 940 generates a measurement<br>
report which is sent to the first STA 902. The measurement report is forwarded<br>
to the measurement report analysis device 922, which selects a transmit beam for<br>
the first STA 902 based on the measurement report. The measurement report<br>
analysis device 922 then signals the selected beam to the beam change device 920<br>
to change the transmit beam for the first STA 902.<br>
