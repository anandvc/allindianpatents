				<td>Field of the invention:<br>
The present invention relates to a device for the collection of essential oil from hydro-distillation of aromatic plant materials.<br>
Background and prior art of the invention:<br>
The isolation of the essential oils from aromatic plant material distillation in laboratory is often necessary in order to evaluate raw materials to be used for large-scale commercial distillation. The determination of the essential oil content is also important in appraising the quality of spices and oleoresin.<br>
Reference may be made to Am. Perfumer, 23, 467, 1928, where such determinations were conveniently made in a special apparatus devised by Cleavenger. This apparatus offers compactness, cohabitation of distillation water, the actual distillation and separation of the essential oil, so that certain chemical as well as physical properties and an accurate determination of the essential oil content using only small quantities of plant material may be determined. Furthermore this apparatus may be used to advantage for steam rectification of small amounts of essential oils. This apparatus consists of two specially designed parts, one oil trap and the other the condenser. Two types of oil traps are used where one for collection of oil lighter than water and the other for oils heavier than water. This apparatus suffers from disadvantages. The isolation of the essential oil with one trap, which is meant for only oils lighter than water, cannot be used for the oil heavier than water. Therefore if the plant material contains an oil mixture both lighter and heavier than water, this trap cannot be used.<br>
Objects of the invention:<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide a device for the collection of<br>
essential oil from hydro-distillation of aromatic plant materials, which obviates the<br>
drawbacks as detailed above.<br>
Another object of the invention is to provide a device, the design of which is very<br>
simple.<br><br>
Still another object of the present invention is to provide a device that can be used For the collection of oil both lighter and heavier than water at the same time. A further object of the present invention is to provide a device which can be used for the measurement of the volume of the oil in the receiving trap itself.<br>
Summary of the invention:<br>
The present invention relates to a device for collection of essential oils from plant materials, consisting of a receiving trap, which can be used for the collection of an oil mixture containing oil both lighter as well as heavier than water, simultaneously. The drawings accompanying this specification (Fig: receiving trap) represent the essential oil receiving trap as depicted.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a device for the collection of essential oils from the hydro-distillation of aromatic plant materials, which comprises a U-shaped glass tube fixed with two standard glass joints in the two ends (C) having at least two side tubes, wherein a side tube (A) with a standard glass joint (D) is fixed at an angle of 5° at a distance from the upper end of the side X, another side tube (B) with one end grooved is fixed at a distance from the upper end of side Y of the said U-tube, and in the lower bottom of the said U-tube, another tube (Z) with a stopcock (S) is fixed in the center.<br>
Detailed description of the invention:<br>
The invention is directed to a device for the collection of essential oil from the hydro-distillation of aromatic plant materials, which comprises a U-shaped glass tube of 3 cm internal diameter fixed two standard glass joints (B-24F) in the two ends (C). In one arm a side tube (A) of 6 cm length and 2 cm internal diameter with a standard glass joint (D, B-19F) is fixed at an 5° angle at a distance of 9 cm from the upper end of the U-tube. This arm of the U-tube is graduated starting from 0 ml at a distance of 11 cm from the upper end of the U-tube. In the other arm of the U-tube, another side tube (B) of 5 cm length and 2 cm internal diameter, with one end grooved, is fixed at a distance of 11 cm from the upper end of the U-tube for fixing<br><br>
rubber tube. In the lower bottom of the U-tube 30 cm from the upper end, a<br>
graduated tube of 1.5 cm internal diameter with a stopcock (S) is fixed in the center.<br>
The total length of the graduated tube is 25 cm and the total height of the trap is 55<br>
cm.<br>
The working of the receiving trap is as follows:<br>
The plant material is taken in a three-necked round bottom flask on a heating<br>
mantle. The flask is fitted with distillation head and condenser. One end of the<br>
condenser is fitted with the above designed trap fitted on a stand though the arm<br>
"D". The other side arm "B" is connected to the three-necked flask with a rubber<br>
tube. When boiling starts the water and oil vapor passes through the condenser,<br>
condense to oil and water and collects in the trap. Once the water level is filled up to<br>
the level of "B", it flows back to the round bottom flask. This process continues and<br>
during this period the essential oil that is lighter than water will collect above water in<br>
the graduated side arm of the trap from which it can be measured the exact volume.<br>
The essential oil, which is heavier than water, will collect in the graduated tube<br>
below the trap from which the volume can be measured.<br>
The working of the trap has been verified with the help of the experiment carried out<br>
in the following examples:<br>
The following examples are given by way of illustration and should not be construed to limit the scope of the present invention<br>

After 1 hr the water vapor started passing through the condenser and circulation of water oil mixture started. The oil was started separating on the top of the water. The heating is continued for 4 hr. The<br><br>
amount of oil collected in the different experiments is tabulated in the following Table <br><br>
