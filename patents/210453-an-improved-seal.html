506-508.DIMPLE ARCADE,<br>
ASHA NAGAR, KAN DIVALI (E),<br>
MUMBAI-400 101,<br>
MAHARASHTRA,<br>
INDIA.<br><br>
An Indian National<br>
2-8-2004<br>
The following specification particularly describes and ascertains the nature of this invention and the manner   in which it is to be performed:<br><br><br>
TECHNICAL FIELD:<br>
This invention relates generally to an improved seal, particularly to an improved tamper proof seal and more particularly to an improved tamper proof seal with metal wire as insert.<br>
Seals are required to shut or seal of outlet of the receptacles such as bottles, boxes, drums, container, wagons and the likes. The seals ensure that the receptacles are not tampered with in an unauthorized manner.<br>
PRIOR ART<br>
Seals and sealing devices are already known in the prior art.<br>
For instant Indian patent no. 150584 provides a sealing device comprising (i) a hollow receptacle having on its inner surface/s one or more ridges /teeth, with their edges facing down ward;(ii) an insert integrally connected to the hollow receptacle by a cord like portion having a hole in the middle and having ridges/teeth, with their edges pointing upward, such that when the said insert is pressed in to the aforesaid hollow receptacle the ridges/teeth of the insert interlock with the ridges/teeth of the hollow receptacle.<br>
Again, Indian patent no. 166770 provides an improved seal comprising:(l) a flat rectangular receptacle with a closed bottom but an open mouth having a pair of downwardly inclined teeth in the mid section of the said receptacle one each on it's two narrow sides, and at the bottom of the said receptacle there is provided at its centre a short vertical wedge whose incline planes face the aforesaid two narrow sides of the receptacle;(ii) a flat insert, integrally connected to the aforesaid receptacle by a cord, the said insert having at its top end a capping and an arrow shaped lower end, vertically slit up the centre forming two barbs which have a lateral springing movement.<br>
Similarly, Indian patent no. 166978 provides an improved positively dead lockable tamper proof seal comprising a casing having a catch means, said casing, being linked to a slidably fixable insert, by an extension cord or the like characterised in that said insert having positively dead lockable springy latch means and comprising a grip having an extension tongue with traverse slot at its front end for twisting a sealing wire or the like wound around a meter casing for sealing when said insert being slid within the said casing wherein the said springy latches yield during entry of said insert in to said casing and spring back to get positively dead locked to said catch means by snap action under thumb /pliers pressure applied there to.<br>
Further, Indian patent no. 172902 provides an improved sealing device comprising a hollow flat rectangular receptacle, closed at one end and<br><br>
open at the other, the inner surface of the walls of the receptacle defining a peripheral seat spaced apart from the closed end of the receptacle such that the inner space defined by the walls of receptacle is wider at the closed end and narrower at the mouth, a flat plunger type element defining a lid for covering the open end of the receptacle and a plunger body; and a resilient member for securing the plunger type element to the receptacle; characterized in that the said plunger body which is insertable in to the hollow receptacle, defines deformable diverging barbs on its side .which cooperates with the said seat defined in the walls of the receptacle such that in its operative configuration the plunger type element is easily insertable in to the receptacle by compressing the divergent barbs which barbs expand to their original form to engage the said seat when the plunger body reaches the closed end of the receptacle; and further characterized that a guide formation is provided on the plunger body to prevent play of the plunger type element in its operative configuration when it is inserted in the receptacle.<br>
The invention disclosed in Indian patent no. 166770 has unsatisfactory sealing properties, as the teeth arrangement provided on the inner surface of the receptacle, because of the inherent resilience of the teeth material permits forceable extraction of the lid/insert and may even break away on forceable immediately or after some use. Further, the geometry of the lid/insert will permit twisting of the insert because of play between the insert and slide walls of the receptacle. The formation of teeth on the inner surface of the receptacle is not a simple job and requires very careful control that is time consuming and increases the cost of production.<br>
Similarly, the invention disclosed Indian patent no. 166978 provides an improved positively dead lockable tamper proof seal however the construction of the insert is complex in nature. The seal can be also cut with the help of sharp blade and after pilferage and adulteration the same seal can be joined with the help of adhesive available in the market freely.<br>
Similarly, the invention disclosed Indian patent no. 172902 provides an improved sealing device however the construction of the insert and the receptacle are complex in nature. In all of the above seals sealing wire/cord is required for sealing.<br>
OBJECTIVE OF THE INVENTION:<br>
The objective of the present invention is to obviate the above-mentioned drawbacks in the prior art and to provide an improved tamper proof seal with metal wire as insert.<br>
Another objective of the invention is to provide a tamper proof seal,<br>
which does not require any sealing wire.<br><br>
Another objective of the invention is to provide an improved tamper proof seal, which holds the monogram or logo of the consignee.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION:<br>
According to the present invention there is provided an improved seal comprising:<br>
(i) a hollow "u" shaped flat receptacle having four side walls, a closed and curved bottom end and an open top end, the said receptacle being divided in to two chambers by a divider at the middle and plurality of raised steps provided on each side of the said divider;<br>
(ii) an insert in the form of a hardened steel wire dimensioned as per the item to be sealed, forming a downwardly extending pair of limbs ending with positively locking springy latch at both ends; such that when the said insert is pressed in to the aforesaid hollow receptacle, the springy latches of the insert are compressed and enabling the insert to be pushed down, and on full insertion, the springy latches open out interlocking with the steps of the divider of the receptacle.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS:<br>
The invention will now be described with respect to the figures in the accompanying drawings, in which<br>
Fig.1: - is a perspective view of the seal according to this invention ,in its<br>
operative configuration;.<br>
Fig.2: - is an elevation of the insert for the seal of figure 1;<br>
Fig.3: - is a sectional view of the hollow receptacle for the seal of figure 1;<br>
Fig.4: - is the top view of the hollow receptacle for the seal of figure 1;<br>
Fig.5: - is the side view of the hollow receptacle for the seal of figure 1;<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTIONS:<br>
Referring to the drawings, the improved seal 1 in accordance with this invention comprises a hollow "u " shaped flat receptacle having four side walls 2a, 2b, 2c and 2d, a closed and curved bottom end 2e and an open top end 2f.A divider 2g divides the hollow receptacle in to two chambers. Two raised steps 2h provided on each side of the said divider.<br><br>
The improved seal 1 includes an insert 3 in the form of a hardened steel wire dimensioned as per the item to be sealed, forming a downwardly extending pair of limbs 3a ending with positively locking springy latch 3b at both ends;<br>
In use when the limbs 3a of said insert is pressed in to the aforesaid hollow receptacle 2, the springy latches 3b of the insert are compressed and enabling the insert to be pushed down, and on full insertion, the springy latches open out interlocking with the steps 2h of the divider of the receptacle.<br>
In a preferred embodiment the divider of the hollow receptacle has inclined surfaces on both sides to facilitate the passage of the limbs of the insert in to the hollow chambers of the receptacle.<br>
In a preferred embodiment the raised steps take the shapes of wedge shaped tooth and lower surfaces of the teeth being at right angle to the divider.<br>
In a preferred embodiment the limbs of the insert are of unequal lengths.<br>
In another preferred embodiment a ridge is provided at the top periphery of the receptacle for easy holding.<br>
In another preferred embodiment the receptacle is made of transparent material.<br>
In yet another preferred embodiment the receptacle is of different colours or combination of colours.<br>
Further the outer surface of the receptacle is embossed with an identifying number and/or mark.<br>
Once the seal is fixed it cannot be moved in any direction (both laterally or horizontally) and can't be tampered as the latches of the insert perfectly interlocks with the raised steps of the divider in side the receptacle.<br>
Furthermore there is very little scope for inserting any pin or sharp tool to damage the steps to open the seal, as there is no open area on the bottom side and very less area on top end of the seal.<br><br>
When I have described and illustrated particular embodiment of my present invention I do not wish to limit myself to the exact form shown which is indeed to illustrate my invention rather than to limit to it.<br>
It is to be expressly understood that the invention is susceptible to such improvements and modifications, which may be made by any person skilled in the art to suit individual job requirement and any such improvements and modifications so made in the seal here in before described and illustrated shall be considered to be falling within the ambit and scope of this invention and the appended claims.<br>
Advantages:<br>
1 .No additional sealing wire or twines required for the article to be sealed.<br>
2.Needs no sealing punch or any tool or implement to crimp or seal or to mark or emboss the monogram.<br>
3.It has individual identification by numerals or letters or selected code, thus making it virtually impossible to substitute the seal.<br>
4.It is absolutely and totally tamper proof and it cannot be opened, without breaking or deforming the seal.<br>
5.As the hollow receptacle has thick vertical walls, it cannot be compressed to unlock.<br><br>
I claim:<br>
