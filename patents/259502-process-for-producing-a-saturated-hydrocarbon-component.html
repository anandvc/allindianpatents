				<td>Process for producing a saturated hydrocarbon component<br>
Technical field<br>
The invention relates to a process based on oligomerization and deoxygenation for<br>
producing a hydrocarbon component, and particularly for producing high-quality<br>
saturated base oil. In the process feedstock of biological origin is preferably<br>
utilized, eventually derived from plant and fish oils, animal fats, natural waxes,<br>
carbohydrates and corresponding synthetic materials and combinations thereof.<br>
Prior art<br>
Base oils are commonly used for the production of lubricants, such as lubricating<br>
oils for automotives, industrial lubricants and lubricating greases. They are also<br>
used as process oils, white oils and metal working oils. Finished lubricants consist<br>
of two general components, lubricating base oil and additives. Lubricating base<br>
oil is the major constituent in these finished lubricants and contributes<br>
significantly to the properties of the finished lubricant. In general, a few<br>
lubricating base oils are used to manufacture a wide variety of finished lubricants<br>
by varying the mixtures of individual lubricating base oils and individual<br>
additives.<br>
Base oils according to the classification of the American Petroleum Institute (API)<br>
Group III or IV are used in high-quality lubricants. API base oil classification is<br>
shown in Table 1.<br><br><br><br>
Oils of the Group III are base oils with very high viscosity indices (VHVI)<br>
produced by modern methods from crude oil by hydrocracking, followed by<br>
isomerization of the waxy linear paraffins to give branched paraffins. Oils of<br>
Group HI also include base oils produced from Slack Wax paraffins from mineral<br>
oils, and from waxes obtained by Fischer-Tropsch synthesis (GTL waxes), for<br>
instance from coal or natural gas using corresponding isomerization techniques.<br>
Oils of Group IV are synthetic polyalphaolefins (PAO). A similar classification is<br>
also used by ATTEL (Association Technique de l'Industrie Europeenne des<br>
Lubrifiants, or Technical Association of the European Lubricants Industry), said<br>
classification also comprising Group VI: Polyinternalolefins (PIO). In addition to<br>
the official classification, also Group II+ is commonly used in this field, this<br>
group comprising saturated and non-sulfurous base oils having viscosity indices<br>
of more than 110, but below 120. In these classifications saturated hydrocarbons<br>
include paraffinic and naphthenic compounds, but not aromatics.<br>
There is also available a definition for base stocks according to API 1509 as: "A<br>
base stock is a lubricant component that is produced by a single manufacturer to<br>
the same specifications (independent of feed source or manufacturer's location);<br>
that meets the same manufacturer's specification; and that is identified by a unique<br>
formula, product identification number, or both. Base stocks may be<br>
manufactured using a variety of different processes." Base oil is the base stock or<br>
blend of base stocks used in API-licensed oil. The known base stock types are 1)<br>
Mineral oil (paraffinic, naphthenic, aromatic), 2) Synthetic (polyalphaolefins,<br><br>
alkylated aromatics, diesters, polyol esters, polyalkylene glycols, phosphate<br>
esters, silicones), and 3) Plant oil.<br>
Already for a long time, especially the automotive industry has required lubricants<br>
and thus base oils with improved technical properties. Increasingly, the<br>
specifications for finished lubricants require products with excellent low<br>
temperature properties, high oxidation stability and low volatility. Generally<br>
lubricating base oils are base oils having kinematic viscosity of about 3 cSt or<br>
greater at 100 °C (KV100); pour point (PP) of about -12 °C or less; and viscosity<br>
index (VI) about 120 or greater. In addition to low pour points also the low-<br>
temperature fluidity of multi-grade engine oils is needed to guarantee that in cold<br>
weather the engine starts easily. The low-temperature fluidity is demonstrated as<br>
apparent viscosity in cold cranking simulator tests at -5 to -40 °C temperature.<br>
Lubricating base oils having KV100 of about 4 cSt should typically have CCS<br>
viscosity at -30 °C (CCS-30) lower than 1800 and oils having KV100 of about 5<br>
cSt should have CCS-30 lower than 2700. The lower the value is the better. In<br>
general, lubricating base oils should have a Noack volatility no greater than<br>
current conventional Group I or Group II light neutral oils. Currently, only a small<br>
fraction of the base oils manufactured today are able to meet these demanding<br>
specifications.<br>
It is no longer possible to produce lubricants complying with the specifications of<br>
the most demanding car manufacturers from conventional mineral oils. Typically,<br>
mineral oils often contain too high concentrations of aromatic, sulfur, and<br>
nitrogen compounds, and further, they also have a high volatility and a modest<br>
viscosity index, that is, viscosity-temperature dependence. Moreover, response of<br>
mineral oils to antioxidant additives is often low. Synthetic and so-called semi-<br>
synthetic base oils play an increasingly important role especially in automotive<br>
lubricants, such as in engine and gear oils. A similar development can be seen for<br>
industrial lubricants. Service life of lubricants is desirably as long as possible, thus<br>
avoiding-frequent oil changes by the user, and further allowing extended<br><br>
maintenance intervals of vehicles for instance in commercial transportation. In the<br>
past decade; engine oil change intervals for passenger cars have increased five<br>
fold, being at best 50,000 km. For heavy-duty vehicles, engine oil change<br>
intervals are at present already on the level of 100,000 km.<br>
The production of lubricants is influenced by increasingly common "Life Cycle<br>
Approach" (LCA) concerning environment, health and safety factors of the<br>
product. What is aimed with LCA are an extended service life of the product, and<br>
minimal drawbacks to the environments associated with the production, use,<br>
handling and disposal of the product. Longer oil change intervals of high-quality<br>
base oils result in decreased consumption of non-renewable mineral crude oil<br>
based raw materials, and lower amounts of hazardous waste oil products.<br>
In addition to the demands for engine technology and base oil production, also<br>
strict environmental requirements direct the industry to develop more<br>
sophisticated base oils. Sulfur free fuels and base oils are required in order to gain<br>
full effect of new and efficient anti-pollution technologies in modern vehicles and<br>
to cut emissions of nitrogen oxides, volatile hydrocarbons and particles, as well as<br>
to achieve direct reduction of sulfur dioxide in exhaust gases. The European<br>
Union has decided that these fuels shall be available to the market from 2005 and<br>
they must be the only form on sale from 2009. Conventional mineral oil base oils<br>
contain sulfur, nitrogen, aromatic compounds, and typically also volatile<br>
compounds. They are less suitable for new engines and thus also environmentally<br>
more detrimental than newer sulfur and aromatic free base oils.<br>
Nowadays, the use of recycled oils and renewable raw materials in the production<br>
of lubricants is frequently an object of interest. The use of renewable raw<br>
materials of biological origin instead of non-renewable fossil raw materials to<br>
produce hydrocarbon components is desirable, because the fossil raw materials<br>
are exhaustible and their effect on environment is detrimental. Problems<br>
associated with recycled oils include complicated purification and reprocessing<br><br>
steps to obtain base oils with high quality. Further, the development of a<br>
functioning and extensive recycling logistic system is expensive.<br>
For the time being, only esters are used in lubricants of renewable and biological<br>
origin. The use of esters is limited to a few special applications such as oils for<br>
refrigeration compressor lubricants, bio-hydraulic oils and metal working oils. In<br>
normal automotive and industrial lubricants, they are used mainly in additive<br>
scale. High price also limit the use of esters In addition, the esters used in engine<br>
oil formulations are not interchangeable with other esters without performing new<br>
engine tests, even in cases where the chemical composition of the substituting<br>
ester is in principle totally similar. Instead, base oils consisting of pure<br>
hydrocarbon structure are partly interchangeable with each other. There are also<br>
some technical problems associated with esters. As polar compounds, esters<br>
suffer greater seal-swelling tendency than pure hydrocarbons. This has created lot<br>
of problems relating to elastomers in hydraulic applications. In addition, ester<br>
base oils are hydrolyzed more easily producing acids, which in turn cause<br>
corrosion on lubricating systems. Further, even greater disadvantage of esters is<br>
that additives developed for non-polar hydrocarbon base oils are not effective for<br>
ester base oils.<br>
Processes wherein triglycerides are cross-linked in a controlled manner using a<br>
suitable metal salt or peroxide initiator, which readily capture hydrogen from the<br>
C-H bond, together with suitable amounts of oxygen are known in the art. Some<br>
cross-linking is also caused by atmospheric oxygen without heating the product,<br>
the reaction being, however, slower. This cross-linking is based on oxygen-<br>
oxygen bonds formed in the molecules. During cross-linking of the triglycerides,<br>
the degree of cross-linking may be controlled by means of processing time and<br>
kinematic viscosity. The viscosity increases with cross-linking as a function of<br>
time, and decreases as the product decomposes.<br><br>
Also a thermal batch process based on reactions of double bonds for producing<br>
stand oil from triglycerides is known, with carbon dioxide being introduced to the<br>
reactor for preventing oxidation. In this case, cross-linking is based on the carbon-<br>
carbon bonds being formed in the molecules. The decomposition products of the<br>
thermal reaction are removed by entrainment with the carbon dioxide gas stream,<br>
or alternatively using vacuum. Cross-linking is an exothermal reaction and<br>
accordingly, both efficient heating for providing the reaction and efficient cooling<br>
to prevent overheating of the product is necessary to maintain the temperature<br>
between 280 and 300 °C. Moreover, the reaction vessel must be quickly cooled<br>
after reaching the desired viscosity, indicating the degree of cross-linking.<br>
In Kirk-Othmer: Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology, 3rd Ed., vol. 7, Dimer<br>
acids, p. 768 a method is presented for producing dimeric acids from unsaturated<br>
carboxylic acids with a radical reaction using a cationic catalyst, the reaction<br>
temperature being 230 °C. In addition to acyclic branched, unsaturated dimeric<br>
acid as the main product also mono and bicyclic dimers are formed.<br>
Unsaturated alcohols may be oligomerized in a similar manner as unsaturated<br>
carboxylic acids using heat and/or catalyst to give alcohol dimers. An acyclic<br>
unsaturated branched diol dimer is the main product.<br>
In Koster R.M. et al., Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 134 (1998) 159<br>
- 169, oligomerization of carboxylic acids, carboxylic acid methyl esters, and<br>
synthetic alcohols and olefins is described, yielding corresponding dimers.<br>
The cross-linked triglyceride, carboxylic acid methyl ester dimer, carboxylic acid<br>
dimer, and fatty alcohol dimer products may be used in lubricant applications, but<br>
since the products contain heteroatoms, they are endowed with corresponding<br>
weaknesses as the base oils derived from esters.<br><br>
Processes wherein the oxygen of a carboxylic acid or ester is removed are also<br>
known. Decarboxylation of fatty acids results in hydrocarbons with one carbon<br>
atom less than the original molecule. The feasibility of decarboxylation varies<br>
greatly with the type of carboxylic acid used as the starting material. Activated<br>
carboxylic acids containing electron-attracting substituents in the position alpha or<br>
beta with respect to the carboxylic group lose carbon dioxide spontaneously at<br>
slightly elevated temperatures. In this case, the RC-COOH bond is weakened by<br>
the electron shift along the carbon chain.<br>
With other types of carboxylic acids, the hydrocarbon chain brings about an<br>
opposite increase of the electron density at alpha carbon, and thus, cleavage of<br>
carbon dioxide is difficult. A suitable catalyst contributes to the reaction. In<br>
Maier, W.F. et a)., Chemische Berichte (1982), 115(2), 808-812, hydrocarbons are<br>
produced from carboxylic acids using heterogeneous N1/Al2O3 and Pd/SiO2<br>
catalysts at 180 °C under hydrogen atmosphere.<br>
Combined decarboxylation and hydrodeoxygenation of oxygen containing<br>
compounds is disclosed in Laurent, E., Delmon, B.: Applied Catalysis, A: General<br>
(1994), 109(1), 77-96, and 97-115, wherein pyrolysis oils derived from biomass<br>
were subjected to hydrodeoxygenation using sulfurized CoMo/γ-Al2O3 and<br>
NiMo/γ-Al2O3 catalysts at 260 - 300 °C, under a hydrogen pressure of 7 MPa.<br>
Reactions of hydrodeoxygenation step are highly exothermal, and require high<br>
amounts of hydrogen.<br>
FI100248 presents a process with two steps wherein middle distillate is produced<br>
from plant oil by hydrogenation of the carboxylic acids or triglycerides of the<br>
plant oil to yield linear normal paraffins, followed by isomerization of said n-<br>
paraffins to give branched paraffins. Conditions of this hydrogen treatment<br>
include a temperature between 330 and 450 °C, a pressure of 3 MPa, and a liquid<br>
hourly space velocity (LHSV) of 0.5 - 5 1/h. In the iosomerization step a<br><br>
temperature between 200 and 500 °C under pressure higher than atmospheric and<br>
LHSV of 0.1 - 101/h were used.<br>
In isomerization processes, noble metal catalysts that are very expensive and<br>
highly sensitive to catalyst poisons are used. Starting materials from biological<br>
sources contain high amounts of oxygen yielding water, carbon monoxide, and<br>
carbon dioxide as the starting material is processed. In addition, said starting<br>
materials of biological origin often contain nitrogen, sulfur and phosphorus<br>
compounds known as catalyst poisons and inhibitors of noble metal catalysts.<br>
They cause decreased service life of the catalyst, and make frequent regeneration<br>
of the catalysts necessary unless removed prior to isomerization process.<br>
Typical basic structural unit of plant and fish oils and animal fats is a triglyceride.<br>
Triglyceride is an ester of glycerol with three fatty acid molecules having the<br>
structure below: <br>
wherein R1, R2 and R3 represent C4-C30 hydrocarbon chains. Fatty acids are<br>
carboxylic acids having long unbranched hydrocarbon chains. Lengths of the<br>
hydrocarbon chains are mainly 18 carbons (C18). C18 fatty acids are typically<br>
bonded to the middle hydroxyl group of glyceroL Typical carbon numbers of the<br>
fatty acids linked to the two other hydroxyl groups are even, being between<br>
carbon numbers C14 and C22.<br>
Fatty acid composition of the starting material of biological origin may<br>
considerably vary among feedstocks from different sources. While several double<br>
bonds may be present in fatty acids, they are non-conjugated, but at least one<br><br>
intermediate -CH2- unit is between them. With respect to configuration, the<br>
double bonds of natural fatty acids are of cis form, hydrogen atoms being thus<br>
located on the same side of the rather rigid double bond. As the number of the<br>
double bonds increase, they are generally located at the free end of the chain.<br>
Lengths of hydrocarbon chains and numbers of double bonds depend on the<br>
various plant or animal fats or waxes serving as the source of the fatty acid.<br>
Animal fats typically contain more saturated fatty acids than unsaturated fatty<br>
acids. Fatty acids of fish oil contain high amounts of double bonds, and the<br>
average length of the hydrocarbon chains is higher compared to fatty acids of<br>
plant oils and animal fats. Fatty acid composition play an important role in the<br>
evaluation of the oxidation resistance, thermal resistance, and low temperature<br>
properties of the feedstock subjected to oligomerization, and further, the type of<br>
oligomerization products.<br>
Waxes are mainly carboxylic acids esterified with alcohols having long chains.<br>
Moreover, waxes contain varying amounts of paraffins (n-alkanes), ketones, and<br>
diketones, primary and secondary alcohols, aldehydes, alkane acids (carboxylic<br>
acids), and terpenes. Carbon numbers of said carboxylic acid and alcohol chains<br>
are typically between C12 and C38.<br>
Prior to processing, starting materials of biological origin are commonly<br>
pretreated with any suitable known methods such as thermally, mechanically for<br>
instance by means of shear forces, chemically for instance with acids or bases, or<br>
physically with radiation, distillation, cooling, or filtering. The purpose of said<br>
chemical and physical pretreatments is to remove impurities interfering with the<br>
process or poisoning the catalysts, and reduce unwanted side reactions.<br>
In a hydrolysis treatment, oils and fats react with water yielding free fatty acids<br>
and glycerol as the product. Three main processes for the industrial production of<br>
fatty acids are known: vapour splitting of triglycerides under high pressure, basic<br>
hydrolysis, and enzymatic hydrolysis. In the vapour splitting process, the<br><br>
hydrolysis of triglycerides using steam is carried out at temperatures between 100<br>
and 300 °C, under a pressure of 1 - 10 MPa, preferable conditions being from 250<br>
to 260 °C and from 4 to 5.5 MPa. Metal oxides like zinc oxide may be added as<br>
the catalyst to accelerate the reaction. High temperature and pressure contribute to<br>
the dissolution of fats in water.<br>
Paraffinic synthetic base oils produced by oligomerization are known in the art,<br>
the typical ones being PAO (polyalphaolefins) and PIO (polyinternal olefins). In<br>
the production thereof, olefinic starting materials from crude oil are used, said<br>
starting materials containing no heteroatoms. The development of base oils of the<br>
polyalphaolefin type was started in the 1930's both in the USA and in Germany<br>
where mainly products with superior low temperature properties suitable for<br>
aircrafts were developed. 1-alkene monomers to be used as starting materials for<br>
PAO are typically produced from ethylene. For commercial PAOs, C8-C12 alpha<br>
olefins or C14-C18 alpha olefins are primarily used as starting materials. In the<br>
production of PAO, the monomer is polymerized thermally or using catalysts of<br>
the Ziegler or Friedel-Crafts type, or using zeolite catalysts to give heavier<br>
products, followed by distillation to obtain desired product fractions, and<br>
hydrogenated to give saturated paraffins. It is possible to produce PAO products<br>
belonging to various viscosity classes, the typical representatives having<br>
kinematic viscosities of 2, 4, 6 and 8 mm2/s at 100 °C (KV100). Moreover,<br>
particularly thick base oils PAO40 and PAO100 having KV100 values of 40 and<br>
100 mm2/s are produced, said base oils being generally used for the production of<br>
thick lubricants, and as viscosity index improvers (VII). PAO products have high<br>
viscosity indices, and at the same time, excellent low temperature properties, pour<br>
points being as low as -60 °C. Because lighter monomeric compounds are<br>
removed by distillation, the volatilities of the products are low and flash points are<br>
high. Oxidation resistance is quite modest without antioxidanTadditives.<br>
PIOs are produced by oligomerizing internal olefins, the double bonds of which<br>
are statistically distributed along the whole length of the hydrocarbon chain.<br><br>
Internal olefins may be produced by dehydrogenating n-paraffines derived from<br>
crude oil. Molecular structures of the products produced from internal C15-C16<br>
linear olefins differ from that of PAO. In comparison to PAO, the properties of<br>
PIO are poorer; the viscosity index is lower, pour point is poorer, and volatility is<br>
higher. Considering quality, PIOs lie between PAO and VHVL The production<br>
technology for PIO is similar to that for PAO, with the exception of a more<br>
aggressive catalytic system for the oligomerization of the less reactive internal<br>
olefins. Solubility of additives in PAO and PIO is rather poor due to lacking<br>
polarity. Esters are often used in formulations to improve solubility.<br>
The use of starting materials of biological origin containing heteroatoms has so far<br>
not been reported or intermediates optionally thermally and/or chemically and/or<br>
physically and/or mechanically treated, in the production of high-quality saturated<br>
base oils.<br>
On the basis of the above teaching, it may be seen that there is an obvious need<br>
for a new alternative process for producing hydrocarbon components preferably<br>
from starting materials of biological origin, and to avoid problems associated with<br>
prior art solutions or at least substantially reduce them. There is also a need for<br>
nonpolar saturated base oils complying with the quality requirements for high-<br>
quality base oils, said base oil being preferably of biological origin and having<br>
more preferable effects on the environment and for end users than traditional<br>
mineral base oils. In addition, there is a need for a process based on the use of<br>
renewable feedstocks, thus saving non-renewable raw materials.<br>
Objects of the invention<br>
An object of the invention is a process for producing a saturated hydrocarbon<br>
component.<br><br>
A further object of the invention is a process for producing a saturated<br>
hydrocarbon component wherein starting materials of biological origin are used.<br>
Another object of the invention is a process for producing a new type of base oils.<br>
Still another object of the invention is a process for producing saturated base oils<br>

Further, another object of the invention is a process for producing saturated diesel<br>
component and gasoline components not containing heteroatoms from starting<br>

An object of the invention is moreover a base oil complying with the requirements<br>
of the API Group IE.<br>
The characteristic features of the process, and base oils of the invention are<br>
presented in the appended claims.<br>
General description of the invention<br>
The process of the invention comprises an oligomerization step wherein the<br>
molecules of the feedstock reacts with each other, thus increasing the carbon<br>
number of the component obtained, and further, a deoxygenation step. Said<br>
deoxygenation may be carried out either as hydrodeoxygenation reaction or<br>
decarboxylation/decarbonylation reactions. In addition, the process of the<br>
invention may also comprise an optional isomerization step for isomerization of<br>
the lighter products, and/or a finishing step. The feedstock for the process is<br>
preferably from biological origin.<br>
In this context, oligomerization refers to dimerization, trimerization and<br>
tetramerization reactions, as well as polymerization and cross-linking reactions.<br><br>
The oligomerization step of the process of the invention is performed to extend<br>
hydrocarbon chain of unsaturated carboxylic acids and/or derivatives thereof, such<br>
as esters, anhydrides and alcohols from a monomeric unit to give a dimer with<br>
two monomeric units, and to higher oligomers. In this oligomerization reaction,<br>
double bonds of the components react with each other under the influence of heat<br>
and/or a catalyst<br>
Carboxylic acids and derivatives thereof also include here fatty acids and<br>
derivatives thereof Carbon number of carboxylic acids and derivatives thereof is<br>
at least C4. Fatty acids of biological origin and/or derivatives thereof are<br>
preferably used.<br>
Deoxygenation refers here to removal of oxygen either by hydrodeoxygenation or<br>
by decarboxylation/decarbonylation reaction. In the deoxygenation, the structure<br>
of the biological starting material will be converted to be either paraffinic or<br>
olefinic, according to the catalyst and reaction conditions used.<br>
In this context, hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) refers to removal of oxygen by means<br>
of hydrogen. Water is liberated in the reaction when esters, alcohols, anhydrides<br>
or carboxylic acid groups are decomposed. All oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus and<br>
sulfur atoms are removed.<br>
Decarboxylation refers here to the removal of oxygen as carbon dioxide, and<br>
decarbonylation refers to the removal of oxygen as carbon monoxide.<br>
In this context, isomerization refers to hydroisomerization of linear hydrocarbons<br>
(paraffins) resulting in a branched structure.<br>
The term "saturated hydrocarbon", used in the specification refers to paraffinic<br>
and naphthenic compounds, but not to aromatics. Paraffinic compounds may<br>
either be branched or linear. Naphthenic compounds are cyclic saturated<br><br>
hydrocarbons, i.e cycloparaffins. Such a hydrocarbon with a cyclic structure is<br>
typically derived from cyclopentane or cyclohexane. A naphthem'c compound<br>
may comprise a single ring structure (mononaphthene) or two isolated ring<br>
structures (isolated dinaphthene), or two fused ring structures (fused dinaphthene)<br>
or three or more fused ring structures (polycyclic naphthenes or polynaphthenes).<br>
Saturated base oils comprise here saturated hydrocarbons.<br>
Carboxylic acids marked for example C18:l means C18 chain with one double<br>
bond.<br>
In this context, pressures are gauge pressures relative to normal atmospheric<br>
pressure.<br>
Classification of the periodic table of the elements is the IUPAC classification.<br>
In this context, width of carbon number range refers to the difference of the<br>
carbon numbers of the largest and the smallest molecules, plus one, in the final<br>
product.<br>
The invention is now illustrated with the appended figure 1 without wishing to<br>
limit the scope of the invention to the embodiment of said figure.<br>
Figure<br>
Figure 1 shows a preferable embodiment of the process according to the<br>
invention. One or more feedstock(s) selected from the group consisting of:<br>
triglyceride feed stream 1, fatty acid feed stream 2, feed stream 3 of the esters of<br>
fatty acids with alcohols having short chains, fatty acid anhydride stream 4, and<br>
fatty alcohol stream 6, are introduced to the oligomerization reactor 10 either as<br>
separate components or as mixtures. Part of the lighter product fraction to be<br><br>
recycled (e.g. 52), or the hydrocarbon stream 201 may be optionally introduced to<br>
the oligomerization reactor 10 as a diluent. Diluent stream 202 comprises the<br>
recycled stream 52, or the hydrocarbon stream 201, or a mixture thereof. Product<br>
11 containing components of the feedstock reacted at double bonds, and hydrogen<br>
as stream 7 are passed from the oligomerization reactor 10 to an optional<br>
prehydrogenation reactor 20 optionally also receiving a diluent stream 202. The<br>
product hydrogenated at double bonds from the prehydrogenation reactor 20 is<br>
passed as stream 21, and hydrogen is optionally passed as stream 7 to a<br>
deoxygenation reactor 30 optionally also receiving a diluent 202. In case<br>
deoxygenation is performed as decarboxylation/decarbonylation reaction, a<br>
mixture of hydrogen 7 and an inert gas e.g. nitrogen may be used as the gas<br>
stream (not shown in the figure). The product containing saturated hydrocarbons<br>
from the deoxygenation reactor 30 is passed as stream 31 to a distillation and/or<br>
separation unit 40 for separation of various product fractions, gas 44, gasoline 43,<br>
diesel 42, and base oil 41. Lighter gasoline and diesel fractions, respectively 43<br>
and 42, are optionally isomerized in hydroisomerization unit 50 in the presence of<br>
hydrogen 7, thus yielding gasoline and diesel streams, respectively 51 and 52,<br>
containing branched hydrocarbons.<br>
In case particularly fatty acids 2 and/or fatty acid esters 3 and/or fatty alcohols 6<br>
are oligomerized, the product stream 12 may be withdrawn from the<br>
oligomerization reactor 10 followed by separation of the non-oligomerized<br>
components for instance by distillation 60. Light non-oligomerized components<br>
are recycled back to the oligomerization reactor 10 as the stream 61, and the<br>
oligomerized components may be passed to prehydrogenation 20 as the stream 62.<br>
In recycling, the stream 63 from distillation 69 may be passed to low temperature<br>
filtering 80 wherein saturated components 81 are separated from components 82<br>
having double bonds to be passed to oligomerization 10. Alternatively, the<br>
distillate 61 may be passed to post-oligomerization reactor 70, in which<br>
unsaturated carboxylic acids 8 with smaller molecules, or olefins 5 may be<br>
introduced for branching linear non-oligomerized unsaturated components. The<br><br>
product containing components of the feedstock reacted at double bonds is passed<br>
from the post-oligomerization reactor 70 as the stream 71 to an optional<br>
prehydrogenation reactor 20.<br>
Detailed description of the invention<br>
It was now surprisingly found that with the process of the invention comprising<br>
oligomerization and deoxygenation steps and an optional isomerization step, high-<br>
quality hydrocarbon components and particularly saturated base oils may be<br>
produced from unsaturated carboxylic acids containing heteroatoms, and from<br>
derivatives thereof, particularly from fatty acids, fatty acid esters, fatty alcohols,<br>
respective fatty acid anhydrides of biological origin, and/or mixtures thereof. The<br>
problems of the prior art processes and products obtained therewith may be<br>
avoided, or at least substantially reduced by means of the process of the invention.<br>
In the process of the invention, especially oligomerization reactions of materials<br>
of biological origin may be utilized in combination with deoxygenation reaction<br>
for the production of saturated base oils in a novel manner. For the<br>
oligomerization of unsaturated carboxylic acids and/or derivatives thereof, such as<br>
fatty acids, fatty acid esters, fatty alcohols, fatty acid anhydrides, and/or mixtures<br>
thereof, the monomers are converted into dimers with two monomers and into<br>
higher oligomers. In case starting materials of biological origin are used for the<br>
production of .base oils, it is necessary to extend the hydrocarbon chain length to<br>
reach the carbon number range required in the base oil applications, leaving only<br>
carbon-carbon bonds in the main structure of the molecule. According to the<br>
invention, this is carried out by allowing the compounds having double bonds to<br>
react with each other, thus producing desired carbon-carbon bonds, and further,<br>
yielding hydrocarbons with carbon numbers in the range from C18 to C550. In<br>
base oil applications, the carbon number range is typically from C18 to C76, and<br>
particularly the carbon number range of thick base oils may even be from C150 to<br>
C550. In the oligomerization reaction, for instance double bonds of the<br><br>
triglyceride molecules react with each other, thus forming a polymeric triglyceride<br>
network. With other feedstocks, mainly dimers,trimers, and tetramers are formed.<br>
In case the feedstock contains polyunsaturated hydrocarbon chains, after<br>
oligomerization and deoxygenation, greater amounts of trimers and hydrocarbons<br>
with ring structure are obtained than with monounsaturated hydrocarbon chains.<br>
In the process of the invention, the feedstock of biological and/or synthetic origin<br>
is oligomerized and deoxygenated. The oligomerization of unsaturated feedstock<br>
components is preferably performed first, followed by deoxygenation to obtain<br>
saturated paraffins without heteroatoms. Alternatively, the unsaturated feedstock<br>
is first subjected to deoxygenation to remove heteroatoms, followed by<br>
oligomerization of the obtained olefinic product, the deoxygenation being,<br>
however, then carried out by decarboxylation or decarbonylation reaction, since<br>
the hydrodeoxygenation reaction is in this case unsuitable.<br>
Following deoxygenation, the process may also comprise an optional<br>
isomerization of the lighter components. Linear normal paraffins having shorter<br>
chains, not belonging to the base oil carbon class, and produced as by-products of<br>
the process, may be isomerized to introduce branches to the hydrocarbon chain<br>
improving the cold flow properties of the product. These isomerized products may<br>
be used for instance as gasoline or diesel components, and further, components<br>
having carbon numbers from C18 to C24 may also be used as light base oil<br>
components.<br>
The process may further comprise an optional prehydrogenation step prior to<br>
deoxygenation, an optional post oligomerization step following the actual<br>
oligomerization step, optional purification steps of the intermediates, recycling<br>
steps of the products, and a finishing step. Feedstocks may optionally be subjected<br>
to one or more pretreatment step(s), for example purification.<br><br>
Feedstock<br>
In the process of the invention, the feed comprises one or more components)<br>
selected from the group consisting of triglycerides, carboxylic acids having<br>
carbon numbers from C4 to C38, esters of C4 to C38 carboxylic acids and Cl-<br>
Cl 1 alcohols, C4-C38 carboxylic acid anhydrides, and C4-C38 alcohols. The<br>
feedstock is preferably selected from the group consisting of triglycerides, fatty<br>
- acids having carbon numbers from C4 to C24, esters of C12 to C24 fatty acids and<br>
C1-C3 alcohols, C12-C24 fatty acid anhydrides, and C12-C24 fatty alcohols, and<br>
mixtures thereof. The feedstock preferably originates from starting materials of<br>
biological origin, or mixtures thereof.<br>
Suitable starting materials of biological origin are selected from the group<br>
consisting of:<br>
a)	plant fats, plant oils, plant waxes; animal fats, animal oils, animal waxes; fish<br>
fats, fish oils, fish waxes, and mixtures thereof, and<br>
b)	free fatty acids or fatty acids obtained by hydrolysis, acid transesterification or<br>
pyrolysis reactions from plant fats, plant oils, plant waxes, animal fats, animaT<br>
oils, animal waxes, fish fats, fish oils, fish waxes, and mixtures thereof, and<br>
c)	esters obtained by transesterification from plant fats, plant oils, plant waxes,<br>
animal fats, animal oils, animal waxes, fish fats, fish oils, fish waxes, and<br>
mixtures thereof, and<br>
d)	esters obtained by esterification of free fatty acids of plant, animal and fish<br>
origin with alcohols, and mixtures thereof, and<br>
e)	fatty alcohols obtained as reduction products of fatty acids from plant fats,<br>
plant oils, plant waxes, animal fats, animal oils, animal waxes, fish fats, fish<br>
oils, fish waxes, and mixtures thereof, and<br>
f)	waste and recycled food grade fats and oils, and fats, oils and waxes obtained<br>
by genetic engineering, and mixtures thereof, and<br>
g)	mixtures of said starting materials.<br><br>
In this context, plants and animals also include algae and insects, respectively.<br>
The starting material of biological origin may also contain free carboxylic acids<br>
and/or esters of carboxylic acids, or oligomerization products of biological<br>
starting materials, without substantially interfering with the process. Suitable<br>
feedstocks are also all compound types mentioned that are produced either totally<br>
or partly synthetically.<br>
Since the purpose of the process is the oligomerization of components having<br>
double bonds, the feedstock preferably contains at least 50 %, and more<br>
preferably at least 80 %, by weight, of unsaturated and/or polyunsaturated<br>
compounds. The unsaturated compound is preferably a monounsaturated<br>
component, particularly preferably a C16:l and/or C18:l component present in<br>
the feedstock in concentrations of above 40 %, and preferably above 70 %, by<br>
weight.<br>
Examples of suitable biological starting materials include fish oils such as baltic<br>
herring oil, salmon oil, herring oil, tuna oil, anchovy oil, sardine oil, and mackerel<br>
oil; plant oils such as rapeseed oil, colza oil, canola oil, tall oil, sunflower seed oil,<br>
soybean oil, corn oil, hemp oil, olive oil, cottonseed oil, mustard oil, palm oil,<br>
peanut oil, castor oil, jatropha seed oil, palm kernel oil, and coconut oil; and<br>
moreover, suitable are also animal fats such as lard, tallow, and also waste and<br>
recycled food grade fats and oils, as well as fats, waxes and oils produced by<br>
genetic engineering. In addition to fats and oils, suitable starting materials of<br>
biological origin include animal waxes such as bee wax, Chinese wax (insect<br>
wax), shellac wax, and lanoline (wool wax), as well as plant waxes such as<br>
carnauba palm wax, ouricouri palm wax, jojoba seed oil, candelilla wax, esparto<br>
wax, Japan wax, and rice bran oil.<br>
The process may also be used for processing mixtures of feedstocks of biological<br>
origin, and synthetic feedstocks, using additional feedstocks produced with other<br>
processes, or synthetic feedstocks, if necessary, suitable for the process step in<br><br>
question. Also pure synthetic feedstocks are suitable, but in this case, the products<br>
are not based on renewable natural resources.<br>
If desired, also linear olefins and olefins having ring structures, preferably C2-<br>
C14 olefins, may also be added in the feedstock, thus allowing for the increase of<br>
the molecular mass with lower carbon numbers than typical C12-C24 carboxylic<br>
acids. Components of the turpentine fraction of tall oil such as alpha pinene,<br>
and/or compounds having double bonds derived from sugars, and/or unsaturated<br>
compounds produced from carboxylic acids via metathesis, and/or synthetic<br>
compounds such as ethylene or propylene may be used as suitable additional<br>
olefinic components.<br>
In the oligomerization, also unsaturated dicaboxylic acids having shorter chains<br>
(<c12 carboxylic acids alcohols and alkyl esters may be used as additional></c12>
feedstocks, allowing for the increase of the molecular mass with lower carbon<br>
than typical C12-C24 carboxylic acids, or derivatives of carboxylic acids. Suitable<br>
unsaturated dicarboxylic acids include maleic acid, fumaric acid, citraconic acid,<br>
mesaconic acid, itaconic acid, 2-methylene glutaric acid, and muconic acid.<br>
In the optional post-oligomerization reaction of the invention, for instance above<br>
molecules having short chains may be oligomerized to carboxylic acids or alkyl<br>
esters of a carboxylic acid or triglycerides or other molecules with double bonds.<br>
Double bonds of compounds derived from carboxylic acids are usually located in<br>
the middle of hydrocarbon chain. Smaller molecules are reacted with double<br>
bonds to give linear or ring structures located in the middle of hydrocarbon chain.<br>
Since the cycle length of the catalyst is short in the processes of carboxylic acids,<br>
the feedstock may first be converted into esters or alcohols, which are less<br>
aggressive to the catalyst. Triglycerides may be transesterified with an alcohol to<br>
obtain alkyl esters. Triglycerides decompose to form an ester with the alcohol and<br>
glyceroL Typically methanol is used as the alcohol, but also other C1-C11<br><br>
alcohols may be used Typical conditions for the transesterification are as follows:<br>
temperature between 60 and 70 °C, pressure between 0.1 and 2 MPa. Excess<br>
amounts of sodium and potassium hydroxides dissolved in methanol are used as<br>
catalysts. Esterification of free carboxylic acids and alcohol requires higher<br>
temperature and pressure (e.g. 240 °C and 9 MPa), or acidic conditions.<br>
Carboxylic acids may also be reduced in known manner to fatty alcohols, either<br>
by direct reduction of the acidic groups to alcohols with lithium aluminium<br>
hydride, thus double bonds remains in alcohols, or by hydrogenation of the alkyl<br>
esters of carboxylic acids to give unsaturated fatty alcohols using a copper-zinc<br>
catalyst at a temperature between 200 and 230 °C, and under a hydrogen pressure<br>
between 20 and 30 MPa. In the hydrogenation reaction, the alcohol used for the<br>
esterification of the carboxylic acid is liberated and may be recycled back to the<br>
esterification, whereas the unsaturated fatty alcohols are passed to the<br>
oligomerization.<br>
In various process steps, hydrocarbons may be used as diluents in the feedstock.<br>
Hydrocarbon can be for instance from biological origin and boiling in diesel fuel<br>
range between 150 and 400 °C, typically between 180 and 360 °C.<br>
The biological starting material yielding the feedstock is preferably pretreated by<br>
known methods for instance to remove impurities. Hydrolysis reaction of<br>
triglycerides may be utilized to produce carboxylic acids to be used as a feed to<br>
oligomerization step. Alternatively, the triglycerides may be hydrolyzed following<br>
oligomerization. In the hydrolysis, glycerol is obtained as the by-product, and thus<br>
no hydrogen is consumed in the HDO step for hydrogenation of glycerol to yield<br>
propane gas. For instance, either the feedstock or the product may be fractioned<br>
by distillation to narrower fractions with respect to hoiling ranges or carbon<br>
numbers, and further, impurities of the feedstock or the final product may be<br>
removed by filtering through suitable filtering aids.<br><br>
The process<br>
Oligomerization step<br>
According to a preferable embodiment of the process of the invention, feedstock<br>
comprising at least one component with double bonds is selected from the group<br>
of triglycerides, carboxylic acids, acid anhydrides, and/or fatty alcohols and<br>
oligomerized. The feedstock contains at least 50 % by weight of unsaturated<br>
and/or polyunsaturated compounds. One of the components of the feedstock is<br>
preferably selected as the main starting material for the oligomerization step and<br>
the oligomerization conditions are adjusted according to this main starting<br>
material. Other feed materials may be mixed with said main starting materials as<br>
long as they will not interfere with the process, or are advantageous for<br>
processing.<br>
Oligomerization reactions are catalyzed by heat and a suitable catalyst. Suitable<br>
catalysts include cationic clay catalysts, preferably zeolite catalysts, particularly<br>
preferable montmorillonite. Oligomerization reactions of carboxylic acids may be<br>
enhanced by additional reagents such as water. In the oligomerization of<br>
carboxylic acids, up to 10 %, preferably from 0.1 to 4 %, and particularly<br>
preferably from 1 to 2 %, by weight, of water is added to the feedstock. It is not<br>
preferable to use excessive amounts of water, because estolides not dimerized<br>
with carbon-carbon bonds are then produced as by-products.<br>
Suitable oligomerization reactors include fixed bed reactors and mixing tank<br>
reactors. Diluents for adjusting the oligomerization may be used in the reaction.<br>
The diesel fraction or another hydrocarbon obtained from the process is a suitable<br>
diluent that may be recycled. Pressure of the oligomerization step is between 0<br>
and 10 MPa, the temperature being between 100 and 500 °C, preferably from 0 to<br>
5 MPa, and from 200 to 400 °C, respectively. In case the reaction is performed as<br>
a batch reaction, the catalyst amount is from 0.01 to 30 %, by weight of the total<br>
reaction mixture, preferably from 0.5 to 10 % by weight. In case a fixed bed<br><br>
reactor is used, the amount of the feedstock, expressed as grams per hour per gram<br>
of the catalyst, ranges between 0.1 and 1001/h.<br>
In a mixed tank reactor, the reaction time is less than 16 hours, preferably less<br>
than 8, particularly preferable less than 4 hours. In case short residence time is<br>
used, the lighter non-oligomerized components may be separated from heavier<br>
components already oligomerized for instance by distillation, followed by<br>
recycling the lighter components to oligomerization. During recycling, the<br>
unreactive saturated components may be separated from components having<br>
double bonds for instance by low temperature filtering. Saturated components are<br>
passed to deoxygenation, and optional isomerization for branching the<br>
hydrocarbon chains.<br>
Prehydrogenation step<br>
The activity of hydrogenation catalysts is primarily lost due to coke formed on the<br>
catalyst surface, and thus the product from the oligomerization step may be<br>
optionally subjected to prehydrogenation under mild conditions to hydrogenate<br>
the double bonds, and further, to reduce the formation of coke in the next<br>
deoxygenation step. Prehydrogenation is performed in the presence of<br>
prehydrogenation catalyst, at a temperature between 50 and 400 °C, under a<br>
hydrogen pressure ranging from 0.1 to 20 MPa, the flow rate WHSV being<br>
between 0.1 and 10 1/h, preferably at a temperature between 150 and 250 °C,<br>
under a hydrogen pressure ranging from 1 to 10 MPa, the flow rate being from 1<br>
to 5 Vh. The prehydrogenation catalyst contains metals of the Group VIII and/or<br>
VIA of the periodic table of the elements. The prehydrogenation catalyst is<br>
preferably a supported Pd, Pt, Ni, NiMo or CoMo catalyst, the support being<br>
either alumina and/or silica.<br>
Deoxygenation step<br>
The deoxygenation may alternatively be performed either as hydrodeoxygenation<br>
or decarboxylation/decarbonylation. Deoxygenation preformed as<br><br>
hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) is suitable for all feedstocks. In the HDO step,<br>
oxygen and oligomerized and optionally prehydrogenated stream is passed to the<br>
HDO catalyst bed comprising one or more catalyst bed(s). In the HDO step, the<br>
pressure is between 0 and 20 MPa, preferably between 1 and 15 MPa, particularly<br>
preferably from 3 to 10 MPa, the temperature being from 100 to 500 °C,<br>
preferably from 200 to 400 °C, particularly preferably from 250 to 350 °C, the<br>
flow rate WHSV is from 1 to 5 1/h, particularly preferably from WHSV from 1 to<br>
3 1/h. In the HDO step, special hydrodeoxygenation catalysts containing a metal of<br>
the Group VIII and/or VIA of the periodic table of the elements, and a support<br>
may be used. The HDO catalyst is preferably a supported Pd, Pt, Ni, NiMo or<br>
CoMo catalyst, the support being either alumina and/or silica.<br>
In case the feedstock contains carboxylic acids and/or carboxylic acid esters, the<br>
deoxygenation may be performed using a decarboxylation/decarbonylation<br>
reaction. In the decarboxylation/decarbonylation reaction, the feedstock and an<br>
optional diluent are introduced to the catalyst bed. The reaction takes place in<br>
liquid phase, and it may be carried out in atmospheric pressure. However, it is<br>
preferable to use vapour pressure according to the reaction temperature of the<br>
reaction mixture. Depending on the feedstock, the pressure in the<br>
decarboxylation/decarbonylation step is between 0 and 20 MPa, preferably<br>
between 0.1 and 20 MPa, the temperature is from 200 to 400 °C, preferably from<br>
250 to 350 °C, and the flow rate WHSV is from 0.1 to 10 1/h, preferably from<br>
WHSV from 1 to 5 1/h. In the decarboxylation/decarbonylation step special<br>
catalysts is used. Catalyst contains a metal of the Group VIII and/or VIA of the<br>
periodic table of the elements, such as a supported Pd, Pt, Ni, NiMo or CoMo<br>
catalyst, the support being either alumina and/or silica and/or activated carbon.<br>
The decarboxylation/decarbonylation catalyst is preferably Pd supported on<br>
carbon in a case of no hydrogen is used in the process, and sulfurized NiMo<br>
supported on alumina in a case of a mixture of hydrogen and an inert gas such as<br>
nitrogen is used in the process. Functional groups no longer exist in the product of<br>
the decarboxylation/decarbonylation step and the products contain only carbon<br><br>
and hydrogen. The carbon number has been reduced by one carbon per functional<br>
group removed.<br>
In case the deoxygenation is performed as decarboxylation/decarbonylation, the<br>
oligomerization may be carried out prior to deoxygenation, and accordingly, the<br>
feedstock of the oligomerization step contains unsaturated carboxylic acids and/or<br>
esters of carboxylic acids. In case the oligomerization is performed after the<br>
decarboxylation/decarbonylation step, the feed of the oligomerization step<br>
contains unsaturated compounds from decarboxylation/decarbonylation having<br>
the carbon numbers reduced by one carbon per functional group removed,<br>
compared to the feedstock.<br>
In the deoxygenation step, HDO and decarboxylation/decarbonylation reactions<br>
described above may be performed simultaneously to yield carbon dioxide or<br>
carbon monoxide from part of the functional groups and part of the functional<br>
groups are hydrodeoxygenated.<br>
Following the deoxygenation step, light fractions may be passed with hydrogen to<br>
a separate isomerization step. The pressure of the isomerization step is from 0.1 to<br>
20 MPa, preferably from 5 to 10 MPa. The temperature is between 100 and 500<br>
°C, preferably from 200 to 400 °C. In the isomerization step, special isomerization<br>
catalysts containing a molecular sieve and a metal of the Group VTH of the<br>
periodic table of the elements, such as Pd, and Pt may be used. Alumina and/or<br>
silica may be used as the support.<br>
Following oligomerization and deoxygenation steps, the product stream may<br>
optionally be finished to remove double bonds and aromatics. In case the finishing<br>
step is carried out using hydrogen in the presence of a catalyst, the step is called<br>
hydrofinishing. In the hydrofinishing step, the pressure is from 1 to 20 MPa,<br>
preferably from 5 to 15 MPa. The temperature is between 50 and 500 °C,<br>
preferably from 100 to 400 °C. In the hydrofinishing step, special catalysts<br><br>
containing a metal of the Group VET as well as alumina and/or silica may be used.<br>
The hydrofinishing catalyst is preferably a supported Pd, Pt, or Ni catalyst, the<br>
support being either alumina and/or silica. The finishing may also be carried out<br>
without hydrogen by removing polar components using adsorption materials, for<br>
instance clay or molecular sieve.<br>
Following oligomerization, deoxygenation and optional isomerization and<br>
finishing steps, the product is fractionated, for instance by distillation. Typical<br>
carbon number ranges of the product components are as follows: gas C1-C4,<br>
gasoline C5-C10, diesel C11-C26, base oil C18-C76.<br>
If desired, the hydrocarbon component obtained as the product or another suitable<br>
hydrocarbon stream may be recycled to various process steps such as to<br>
oligomerization and deoxygenation steps for improving the conversion and/or<br>
selectivity, or to control the exothermal nature of the reactions.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, the product already oligomerized may be<br>
oligomerized further by introducing additional monomer (mixing tank reactor)<br>
into the process, or by repeated recycling of the product already oligomerized<br>
while adding the monomer (continuous reactor). In this way, especially thick base<br>
oils having carbon numbers as high as C150-C550 may be provided, said thick<br>
base oils being useful in the production of thick lubricants and as improvers of the<br>
viscosity index.<br>
Product<br>
It was surprisingly found that high-quality saturated non-polar hydrocarbon<br>
component preferably of biological origin, having excellent viscosity and low<br>
temperature properties, especially suitable as base oils was obtained with the<br>
process of the invention. The product is branched by carbon-carbon bonds.<br><br>
A hydrocarbon component preferably of biological origin, suitable as solvent,<br>
gasoline or diesel fuel or diesel fuel component is also obtained. The diesel<br>
component or C18-C24 base oil component may be isomerized to improve the<br>
low temperature properties. The gasoline component may be isomerized to<br>
increase the octane number. There is no need for isomerization in case olefins<br>
with short chains or unsaturated carboxylic acids with short chains are used in<br>
post-oligomerization of the process for branching the remaining double bonds.<br>
The carbon number and the carbon number range of the base oil depend both on<br>
the biological starting material of the feedstock and the production process.<br>
Conventional carbon number range of the base oil applications of the prior art is<br>
from C18 to C76, whereas the carbon number range of particularly thick base oils<br>
may be as high as from C150 to C550. In case the kinematic viscosity range<br>
KV100 between 4 and 7 mm2/s is desired, branched and/or cyclic paraffins with a<br>
single carbon number are typically obtained from feedstocks containing<br>
carboxylic acids with identical chain lengths using the process of the invention,<br>
following oligomerization and HDO steps.<br>
The carbon number range of the base oil or base oil component produced by the<br>
oligomerization and combined HDO-decarboxylation/decarbonylation process of<br>
the invention is extremely narrow, the carbon number range of the product being<br>
from C30 to C32 for feedstocks containing typically C16 components, and from<br>
C34 to C36 for feedstocks containing C18 components, in case the viscosity range<br>
KV100 between 4 and 7 mm2/s is desired. In case the feedstock is a mixture of<br>
C16 and C18 components, the width of the carbon number range of the product is<br>
typically seven carbons. Carbon number range of the base oil of the invention may<br>
also be at very high level, even as high as from C150 to C550 in case particularly<br>
heavy base oils suitable as viscosity increasers and viscosity index improvers are<br>
desired.<br><br>
In Table 2 below, carbon numbers and typical structures of base oils of biological<br>
origin according to the invention (1 and 2), and synthetic base oils of the prior art<br>
having a KV100 from 4 to 6 mm2/s (3-5) are presented. Most typical carbon<br>
numbers are bold-faced. With-respect to the molecular structures, the base oil or<br>
base oil component of the invention differs from the products of the prior art, as<br>
shown by the table.<br>
In Table 2, structures of naphthenes are typical examples of a compound group. In<br>
structural examples, the carbon number ranges of the oligomeric dimers no. 1 and<br>
2 produced from C18 are between C34 and C36, and between C51 and C54,<br>
respectively, whereas the carbon number ranges of known synthetic hydrocarbon<br>
base oils of the same viscosity class, such as PAO, is between C32 and C48, and<br>
C30 and C48 for PIO.<br><br><br><br>
SaturatedTiydrocarbons are classified according to the carbon and hydrogen atoms<br>

In Table 2, the percentages (%, by FIMS) refer to the groups of compounds<br>
determined according to said method.<br>
Base oil components of Table 2 are produced as follows:<br>
1. Oligomerized and hydrogenated C18 fatty acid dimer according to the<br>
invention, produced from tall oil<br><br>
2.	Oligomerized and hydrogenated C18 fatty acid trimer according to the<br>
invention, produced from tall oil<br>
3.	PAO C16 produced by oligomerization from 1-hexadecene using a<br>
heterogeneous catalyst<br>
4.	PAO CIO produced by oligomerization from 1-decene using a homogeneous<br>
catalyst<br>
5.	PIO produced by dimerization of internal C15-C16 olefin.<br>
Oligomerized dimers and trimers of the invention (structures 1 and 2 of Table 2)<br>
are branched at double bonds within C18 hydrocarbon chain, thus having pairs of<br>
tertiary carbons on adjacent carbon atoms in the molecular structure. PIO is<br>
typically a dimer produced from shorter C15-C16 hydrocarbons, whereas the<br>
product of the invention is a C16 and/or C18 dimer. In addition, significant<br>
amount, even-more than 50 %, by FIMS, of mononaphthenes is present in the<br>
product of the invention.<br>
In the production method of polyalpha olefins of the prior art, the reaction<br>
typically takes place with boron trifluoride catalysts at double bonds at the end of<br>
the C10 chain, thus leaving one methylene group (-CH2-) between tertiary carbons<br>
(structure 4 in Table 2). In case the oligomerization is performed using a<br>
heterogeneous catalyst, the double bonds are shifted from the alpha position,<br>
while simultaneously, skeletal isomerization occurs, thus leaving from 1 to 10<br>
methylene groups between tertiary carbons in the typical structure of the base oil<br>
obtained (structure 3 in Table 2, e.g. 4 methylene groups). In case oligomerization<br>
is carried out using a homogeneous catalyst, skeletal isomerization takes<br>
respectively place in the hydrogenation step following oligomerization, and thus<br>
C1-C3 side branches are formed next to double bonds in the molecules of<br>
structure 4 shown in Table 2. There are mainly alkyl branches in PAO and PIO<br>
base oils of the prior art, whereas naphthenic components branched by ring<br>
structures are present in the product of the invention, in addition to alkyl branches.<br><br>
Pour point of the high quality base oil obtained with the process of the invention<br>
is at best less than -40 °C, and accordingly, the base oil is very suitable for<br>
demanding low temperature conditions. The viscosity index of the product may be<br>
as high as 125, the product thus being suitable in base oil applications of Group<br>
III.<br>
The molecular mass of the product may be adjusted according to carbon number<br>
ranges necessary for different applications by adding suitable unsaturated<br>
carboxylic acids or olefins to the feedstock. Carboxylic acids having small<br>
molecules, or olefins cross-linking or oligomerizing with the fatty acids of<br>
triglycerides form short branches on the main hydrocarbon chain of the fatty acid.<br>
In case other natural cyclic compounds such as alpha pinene are used as additional<br>
components of the feedstock, molecules having ring structures in the side chain<br>
within the molecular chain are obtained. One or two additional components are<br>
preferably oligomerized in the product. According to the invention, corresponding<br>
products taylored with respect to hydrocarbon chain lengths may also be produced<br>
from other carboxylic acids and from other bio components with short chains.<br>
Lighter branched components from HDO treatment are very suitable as bio diesel<br>
components.<br>
The base oil of biological origin according to the invention comprises a branched<br>
saturated hydrocarbon product. Said product is produced from biological starting<br>
material, said product containing at least 90 %, preferably at least 95 %,<br>
particularly preferably at least 97 %, and at best 99 % by weight, of saturated<br>
hydrocarbons. Moreover, the product of the invention contains more than 20 %,<br>
but not more than 90 %; preferably more than 20 %, but not more than 80 %; and<br>
particularly preferably more than 20 %, but not more than 60 % of<br>
mononaphthenes, based on the FIMS method, and less than 3.0 %, preferably less<br>
than 1.0 %, and particularly preferably less than 0.1 % of polycyclic naphthenes<br>
by FIMS. In addition, the product of the invention contains up to 20 %, preferably<br><br>
up to 10 %, and particularly preferably up to 5 %, and at best up to 1 % by weight<br>
of linear paraffins (GC).<br>
For base oils of the invention, the viscosity index is at least 100 and preferably at<br>
least 110, and particularly preferably at least 128, as determined by the method of<br>
ASTMD2270.<br>
The product of the invention is branched with carbon-carbon bonds, this structure<br>
endowing the product with a very low pour point not more than 0 °C, preferably<br>
not more than -10 °C, and particularly preferably not more than -35 °C (ASTM D<br>
5950).<br>
For base oils or of the invention, having a viscosity KV100 of 4-7 mm2/s, the<br>
width of the carbon number range is no more than 9 carbons, preferably no more<br>
than 7 carbons, and particularly preferably no more than 3 carbons (determined by<br>
field ionization mass spectrometry, FIMS). More than about 50 %, preferably<br>
more than 75 % and particularly preferably more than 90 % by weight of the base<br>
oil contains hydrocarbons belonging to this narrow carbon number distribution.<br>
Sulfur content of said base oil of the invention is less than 300 ppm, preferably<br>
less than 50 ppm, and particularly preferably less than 1 ppm, (ASTM D 3120).<br>
Nitrogen content of said base oil of the invention is less than 100 ppm, preferably<br>
less than 10 ppm, and particularly preferably less than 1 ppm, (ASTM D 4629).<br>
Base oils of the invention contains carbon 14C isotope, which may be considered<br>
as an indication of the use of renewable raw materials. Typical 14C isotope content<br>
of the product completely of biological origin is at least 100 %, determined as the<br>
content of radioactive carbon on the basis of radioactive carbon content in the<br>
atmosphere in 1950 for a product completely based on biological materials<br>
(ASTM D 6866). 14C isotope content of the base oil is lower in case other than<br><br>
biological components are used in the processing of the product, said content<br>
being, however, more than 50 %, preferably more than 90 %, particularly<br>
preferably more than 99 %. In this way, even low amounts of base oil of<br>
biological origin may be detected in other types of hydrocarbon base oils.<br>
Volatility of the base oil component with a narrow boiling range, obtained<br>
according to the invention, is extremely low compared to similar products of the<br>
prior art. For base oil of the invention the volatility of product, having KV100<br>
from 3 cSt to 8 cSt, is no more than 2271.2*(KV100)-3.5373 % by weight as<br>
determined by the method of DIN 51581-2 (Mathematical Noack method based<br>
on ASTM D 2887 GC distillation).<br>
The cetane number of the product obtained with the process of the invention,<br>
suitable as a diesel component, is more than 40, preferably more than 55, and<br>
particularly preferably more than 70. It contains more than 60 %, preferably more<br>
than 99 % by volume, of paraffins, and less than 30 %, preferably less than 1 %<br>
by volume, of aromatics, based on the IP-391 method. The diesel product<br>
comprises less than 40 %, preferably less than 10 %, by weight, of linear n-<br>
paraffins. The cloud point of the diesel component is less than 0 °C, preferably<br>
less than -15 °C, and particularly less than -30 °C. Typically, the diesel product<br>
obtained is totally of biological origin. In the product of the invention, there are<br>
branches formed by carbon-carbon bonds, this structure resulting in a very low<br>
cloud point. Due to the biological origin, said products of biological origin also<br>
contain carbon 14C isotope indicating that renewable raw materials are used. 14C<br>
content of a product of totally biological origin is at least 100 %.<br>
Selection of the biological feedstock has a strong influence on the composition<br>
and boiling range of the product. Moreover, the feed may be fractioned by<br>
distillation to fractions having narrow carbon numbers that may be tailored for<br>
different applications. For feedstocks having hydrocarbon chain lengths of C16,<br>
C18, C20, and C22, typical carbon numbers of the dimer products are respectively<br><br>
C32, C36, C40, and C44 following hydrodeoxygenation, said carbon numbers<br>
being reduced by two to C30, C34, C38, and C42 following<br>
decarboxylation/decarbonylation. Since the distillation range of the product<br>
mainly depends on the hydrocarbon chain length, narrow product fractions are<br>
obtained.<br>
Advantages of the invention<br>
The process of the invention, and the obtained product have several advantages,<br>
including for instance the use of renewable raw materials instead of non-<br>
renewable feedstocks for lowering carbon dioxide emissions contributing to the<br>
greenhouse effect. A biological starting material containing heteroatoms serves<br>
according to the invention as a fully new raw material source for high-quality<br>
saturated base oils.<br>
Starting materials of the process of the invention are available all over the world,<br>
and moreover, the utilization of the process is not limited by significant initial<br>
investments, in contrast for instance to the GTL technology.<br>
The products of the inventive process are carbon dioxide neutral with respect to<br>
the use and disposal thereof, that is, they will not increase the carbon dioxide load<br>
of the atmosphere, in contrast to products derived from fossil starting materials.<br>
The base oil prepared according to the present invention is hydrolytically more<br>
stabile and it has a structure not decomposing under humid conditions, unlike the<br>
esters and other base oils containing heteroatoms, such as fatty alcohol dimers. In<br>
addition, the oxidation resistance of saturated hydrocarbons is better than that of<br>
corresponding base oils containing unsaturated groups on the basis of fatty acid or<br>
fatty alcohol dimers, or ester base oils. A saturated hydrocarbon component is not<br>
decomposed as easily as esters that form corrosive acids. A nonpolar and<br>
saturated hydrocarbon component is obtained using the process of the invention<br><br>
by removing the oxygen of alcohols, esters, or carboxylic acids in the<br>
deoxygenation step as well as the heteroatoms of any impurities of the feedstock.<br>
Oligomerizing carboxylic acid derivatives yield a structure having branches<br>
formed by carbon-carbon bonds following deoxygenation. In C12:1 - C20:l<br>
oligomerization, lengths of the obtained branches are typically from C3 to C11.<br>
Such hydrocarbons have very low pour points favourable for base oil applications,<br>
and thus the product is liquid at very low temperatures, and further, it has a<br>
superior viscosity index. The produced saturated hydrocarbon product is a suitable<br>
component of base oils without any mixing limitations, and further, it is<br>
compatible with lubricant additives.<br>
The base oil of the invention is endowed with superior technical properties<br>
compared to conventional hydrocarbon oils of the corresponding viscosity class,<br>
particularly in cases where KV100 is from 4 to 7 mm2/s. Narrow boiling range<br>
indicates that the product does not contain any initial light fraction, meaning<br>
molecules considerably lighter than the average shown as decreased volatility of<br>
the product and resulting in reduced emissions in practical applications. The base<br>
oil product does not contain heavy distillation "tail" meaning t the molecules<br>
considerably heavier than the average, resulting in excellent low temperature<br>
properties of the product.<br>
For the base oil of the invention, the carbon number and boiling ranges are<br>
governed by the feedstock composition. For base oils of the prior art, the boiling<br>
range is adjusted by distilling the product to obtain a fraction having the desired<br>
kinematic viscosity. It is preferable for the lubricants to have base oils with<br>
narrow carbon numbers and thus narrow boiling ranges, and accordingly, the<br>
compositions contain molecules of similar sizes behaving under different<br>
conditions in a similar way.<br>
For the base oil or base oil component, high viscosity index of the product<br>
indicates that the amount of the viscosity index improver typically used in<br><br>
lubricating compositions may be reduced. It is generally known that for instance<br>
in engine oils, the VII component is the main cause for fouling of the engine. In<br>
addition, reduction of the amounts of VII results in significant savings in costs.<br>
Compared to conventional base oils derived from crude oil, no sulfur or nitrogen<br>
are present in said products. The process based on purified starting materials<br>
derived from natural fatty acids allows the safe use of products in such<br>
applications where the users are exposed to said oil or vapour of oil. Moreover,<br>
response of the product of the invention to antioxidant agents and agents lowering<br>
pour point is excellent, thus allowing for the longer use of the lubricants prepared<br>
-from said base oil, as well as the use thereof under cold weather conditions.<br>
Compared to esters, the base oil of the invention is more compatible with<br>
conventional base oil components derived from crude oil and with other<br>
hydrocarbon base oils, as well with lubricant additives. Moreover, there are no<br>
such problems with elastomers such as sealing materials as encountered for esters.<br>
Advantages of the base oil of the invention include the fact that it complies with<br>
the requirements for base oils according to API Group n, preferably Group III,<br>
and may be used in compositions of engine oils like other base oils of API Group<br>
II or HI classification, according to same oil change rules.<br>
The base oil of the invention is derived from renewable natural resources as<br>
clearly seen from the l4C isotope content of the product. I4C isotope content of the<br>
product is at least 100 % for products of biological origin, and 0 % for products<br>
derived from crude oil. Proportion of the base oil component of biological origin<br>
may also be determined on the basis of the 14C isotope content of the base oil with<br>
an accuracy of at least 1 %.<br>
Low temperature properties and the cetane number of the middle distillate<br>
produced by the process of the invention, suitable as a diesel fuel, are also<br><br>
excellent, the middle distillate thus being suitable in demanding low temperature<br>
applications.<br>
With the optional prehydrogenation step, side reactions of double bonds such as<br>
polymerization, ring formation, and aromatization may be decreased, said side<br>
reactions being detrimental to the viscosity properties of the products and causing<br>
coke formation on the HDO catalyst.<br>
By means of an optional recycling of the unreacted feedstock components, more<br>
reactions of the double bonds may be achieved to improve the product yield.<br>
Instead of or in addition to biological starting materials, synthetic compounds<br>
having a corresponding chemical structure may also be used in the invention as<br>
the feed.<br>
The properties of the hydrocarbon components produced according to the<br>
invention, and described in the following examples are excellent, and moreover,<br>
carbon number ranges and distillation ranges are very narrow. The process of the<br>
invention provides a molecular structure having superior viscosity properties and<br>
excellent low temperature properties. The products are well suited as base oils<br>
without blending limitations, and further, the products are also compatible with<br>
lubricant additives.<br>
The invention is now illustrated by means of the following examples. The purpose<br>
is, however, not to limit the scope thereof to the embodiments described or<br>
combinations thereof. The invention may also be carried out otherwise than in the<br>
way specifically described without departing from the appended claims.<br>
Examples<br><br>
Example 1<br>
Preparation of a hydrocarbon component from plant oil<br>
Feedstock containing 200 ml of soybean oil, 6 g of montmorillonite catalyst, and<br>
5 ml of distilled water, was loaded in high pressure Parr reactor. The temperature<br>
was increased to 270 °C and the oil was allowed to oligomerize while slowly<br>
mixing for 7 hours.<br>
Thereafter, in the HDO step, the mixture oligomerized above was hydrogenated in<br>
the high pressure Parr reactor using dried and activated NiMo/Al2O3 catalyst to<br>
yield i-paraffin. 200 ml of oligomerized soy oil mixture was hydrogenated at 325<br>
°C, under a hydrogen pressure of 5 MPa, until no acid groups were detected in the<br>
FTIR spectrum of the sample. The reaction mixture was mixed at 300 rpm. The<br>
final product was distilled, and mainly branched and cyclic C36 paraffin was<br>
obtained as the product.<br>
The properties of the hydrocarbon component obtained are shown in Table 3.<br>
Hydrocarbon components may also be produced in a similar manner from other<br>
plant and fish oils and animal fats comprising double bonds.<br>
Example 2<br>
Preparation of a hydrocarbon component from methyl esters of carboxylic<br>
acids derived from soybean oil<br>
Soybean oil was pretreated by transesterification with methanol under basic<br>
conditions, at temperature of 70 °C under a pressure of 0.1 MPa in the presence of<br>
a sodium methoxide catalyst in two steps. Methyl esters of carboxylic acids were<br>
purified by washing with an acid and water, and then they were dried. The<br>
carboxylic acid composition of the methyl ester derived from soybean oil was as<br>
follows: C16:0,11%; C18:2, 20 %; C18:l, 8 %; C18:2, 54 %; and C18:3, 6 %.<br><br>
The carboxylic acid methyl ester mixture obtained above was oligomerized in a<br>
high pressure Parr reactor. 200 ml of the feedstock and 6 g of bentonite catalyst<br>
were introduced into the reactor, the reactor was pressurized with nitrogen twice<br>
to displace oxygen, then the temperature was increased to 350 °C, and the<br>
carboxylic acid methyl ester mixture was allowed to oligomerize while slowly<br>
mixing for 7.2 hours. Monomeric, dimeric, and trimeric methyl esters were<br>
separated from the reaction mixture using a silica column.<br>
Then, the dimeric and the trimeric methyl esters obtained above were respectively<br>
hydrogenated as described in example 1, and the final product was distilled, thus<br>
yielding 26 %, by weight, of branched and cyclic C36 paraffin, and 15 %, by<br>
weight, of branched and cyclic C54 paraffin.<br>
The properties of the hydrocarbon component obtained are presented in Table 3.<br>
The properties of the product are excellent, the molecular distribution being very<br>
narrow. Hydrocarbon components may also be produced in a similar manner from<br>
other methyl esters of carboxylic acids of plant, fish or animal origin comprising<br>
several double bonds. The yield of the process may be improved by recycling the<br>
unreacted monomers.<br>
Example 3<br>
Preparation of a hydrocarbon component from carboxylic acids derived<br>
from tall oil<br>
In the pretreatment step, free carboxylic acids of tall oil were distilled. Thereafter,<br>
the carboxylic acids were oligomerized in a high pressure Parr reactor. 200 g of<br>
the feedstock (carboxylic acids), 16 g of montmorillonite catalyst, and 10 g of<br>
water were introduced into the reactor. The temperature was increased to 255 °C,<br>
and the carboxylic acids were allowed to oligomerize while slowly mixing for 3<br>
hours. The mixture was cooled, and the catalyst was filtered off. Monomers were<br><br>
separated from the dimers and trimers (acids) of the reaction mixture using a silica<br>
column. The yield of the carboxylic acid dimer was 45 %, by weight.<br>
In the HDO step, the fraction containing dimers was hydrogenated as in Example<br>
1 until no carboxylic acid peak was present in the FTIR spectrum. Both branched<br>
and cyclic paraffins were obtained as the product.<br>
The properties of the hydrocarbon component obtained are presented in Table 3.<br>
Hydrocarbon components may also be produced in a similar manner from free<br>
carboxylic acids derived from other oils than from tall oil, or from hydrolysed<br>
carboxylic acids of plant or fish oil, or animal fats, said acids comprising double<br>
bonds.<br>
Example 4<br>
Preparation of a hydrocarbon component from carboxylic acids derived<br>
from tall oil, utilizing prehydrogenation<br>
In the pretreatment step, free carboxylic acids of tall oil were distilled. Then, the<br>
feedstock comprised 30 % of C18:l, 42 % of C18:2, and 9 % of C18:3 carboxylic<br>
acids, by weight. In addition, the feedstock contained 2 % of resin acids. The<br>
carboxylic acids of tall oil were oligomerized in a high pressure Parr reactor. 200<br>
g of the feed mixture, 16 g of a montmorillonite catalyst, and 10 g of water were<br>
loaded into a reactor. For the displacement of oxygen, the nitrogen pressure was<br>
increased to 0.5 MPa, and the mixture was stirred at 600 rmp for a moment.<br>
Pressure was released, and the pressurization with nitrogen was repeated. Then<br>
the temperature was increased to 225 oC, and the carboxylic acids were allowed to<br>
oligomerize while slowly mixing for 2 hours. The product was cooled, and the<br>
catalyst was filtered off. Monomers, dimers, and trimers (acids) were separated<br>
from the reaction mixture using a silica column. The yield of the carboxylic acid<br>
dimer was 45 %, by weight.<br><br>
Prior to HDO step, the double bonds of the dimers obtained above were<br>
hydrogenated using a presulfurized NiMo/Al2O3 catalyst in a high pressure Parr<br>
reactor of 450 ml. Prehydrogenation was performed using a dried and activated<br>
catalyst at 230 °C, under a hydrogen pressure of 5 MPa while mixing at 300 rpm.<br>
Hydrogenation of the dimers was continued until no double bonds were seen in<br>
the FTIR spectrum.<br>
The dimers was hydrogenated in the HDO step as in Example I, until the<br>
carboxylic acid peak was disappeared from the FTIR spectrum, followed by<br>
filtering of the paraffinic product kieselguhr. Both branched and cyclic C34, C35,<br>
C36 paraffins were obtained as the final products.<br>
The properties of the hydrocarbon component obtained are presented in Table 3.<br>
The properties of the hydrocarbon component are excellent, the molecular<br>
distribution being very narrow. Hydrocarbon components may also be produced<br>
in a similar manner from free carboxylic acids derived from other oils than from<br>
tall oil, or from hydrolysed carboxylic acids of plant or fish oil, or animal tats,<br>
said acids comprising double bonds.<br>
Example 5<br>
Preparation of a hydrocarbon component from methyl esters of carboxylic<br>
acids derived from soybean oil, and alpha pincne<br>
Soybean oil was transesterified with methanol as in Example 2, thus yielding<br>
methyl esters of carboxylic acids. The reaction mixture was purified by washing<br>
with an acid and water. Finally, the carboxylic acid methyl ester was dried. The<br>
carboxylic acid composition of the methyl ester was as follows: 016:0, 11%;<br>
C18:0, 20 %; C18:l, 8 %; C18:2, 54 %; and C18:3, 6 %.<br>
The soybean oil methyl ester obtained above was oligomerized with alpha pinene,<br>
the molecular ration being 2:1 respectively, in a high-pressure Parr reactor using 8<br><br>
% of a bentonite catalyst, and 4 % of water. 200 ml of the feedstock mixture was<br>
loaded into the reactor. The displacement of Oxygen was done as in example 4. *<br>
The temperature and the pressure were respectively increased to 310 °C, and<br>
2MPa, and the soybean oil methyl ester was allowed to oligomerize with alpha<br>
pinene while slowly mixing for 6 hours.<br>
The oligomerized product was subjected to hydrodeoxygenation as described in<br>
Example 1. Monomers were separated from the final product by distillation, thus<br>
giving "pinene branched" C28 isoparaffin, and a mixture of paraffinic dimers and<br>
trimers from carboxylic acid methyl ester. The properties of the hydrocarbon<br>
component obtained as the product are presented in Table 3. Branched<br>
hydrocarbon components may also be produced in a similar manner from other<br>
carboxylic acids of plant, animal or fish origin, or fats, said acids comprising<br>
several double bonds, or methyl esters of carboxylic acids and suitable<br>
compounds with small molecular sizes, preferably of biological origin.<br>
Example 6<br>
Preparation of a heavy hydrocarbon component from carboxylic acids of tall<br>
oil<br>
Tall oil was oligomerized as in Example 3, with the exception that the reaction<br>
was carried out while slowly mixing for 7 hours. The trimers were separated from<br>
the dimers and monomers of the reaction mixture using a silica column.<br>
The trimers obtained above were hydrogenated in a HDO step as in Example 1<br>
until no carboxylic acid peak was present in the FTTR spectrum. Both branched<br>
and cyclic paraffin was obtained as the product. The properties of the product are<br>
shown in Table 3. Hydrocarbon components may also be produced in a similar<br>
manner from free carboxylic acids derived from other oils than from tall oil, or<br>
from hydrolysed carboxylic acids of plant or fish oil, or animal fats, said acids<br>
comprising double bonds.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
Example 7<br>
Demonstration ofthe biological origin ofthe hydrocarbon component<br>
Hydrocarbon component of biological origin from example 6 was weighed into a<br>
base oil derived from mineral oil of the Group HI, and mixed thoroughly. For the<br>
first sample, 0.5014 g of the hydrocarbon component of biological origin was<br>
weighed, and base oil component of the Group II was added in an amount to<br>
obtain a total weight of 10.0 g; for the second sample, 1.0137 g of the<br>
hydrocarbon component of biological origin was weighed, and base oil<br>
component of lie Group II was added in an amount to obtain a total weight of<br>
10.0232 g. The measured results are in Table 5, below. The results are expressed<br>
as "percent modern carbon", based on the content of radioactive carbon of the<br>
atmosphere in 1950. At present, percentage of modern carbon in the atmosphere is<br>
about 107 %. δ13 C value shows the ratio of stable carbon isotopes 13C/I2C. By<br>
means of this value, the isotope fractionation taking place in the sample treatment<br>
process may be corrected. Actual results are presented in the last column. Method<br>
is ASTM D6866.<br><br><br>
Example 8<br>
Carbon number distribution<br>
The carbon number distribution of the base oils according to invention is<br>
described narrower than that of conventional base oils. The baseoils of the<br>
invention contain higher amount of higher boiling C34 - C36 fractions compared<br>
to the conventional products of same viscosity range (KV100 about 4 cSt), as<br>
shown in Figure 2. The carbon number distribution is determined by FIMS. The<br>
sample of FIMS analysis is that of example 4 with C18 tall oil fatty acid feed. In<br>
addition to hydrodeoxygenation to produce C36 compounds, also<br>
decarboxylation/decarbonylation lead to parafflnic C35/C34 compounds<br>
(combined HDO-decarboxylation/decarbonylation).<br><br>
