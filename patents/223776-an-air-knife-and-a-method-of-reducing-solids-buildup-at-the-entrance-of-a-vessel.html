				<td>AN AIR KNIFE AND A METHOD OF REDUCING<br>
SOLIDS BUILDUP AT THE ENTRANCE OF A VESSEL<br>
The present invention relates to an air knife and a method of reducing<br>
solids buildup at the entrance of a vessel and generally, relates to the use of a<br>
novel air knife to help prevent solid particulars from blocking the entrance to a<br>
vessel. More specifically, the present invention is particularly useful for reducing<br>
blockage by solid chlorides removed from a titanium tetrachloride product gas by a<br>
cyclone or by some other gas/solids separation device, in processes for producing<br>
titanium tetrachloride.<br>
The production of titanium tetrachloride ("TiCl4") via the chlorination of titanium<br>
values in a titanium-containing starting material is generally known in the art The<br>
production of("TiCl4") is useful, for example, in the production of titaniummetal or titanium<br>
dioxide ("TiCl4").<br>
As is known in the art, ("TiCl4") can be produced by reacting chlorine gas with titanium-<br>
containing starting materials in a chlorinator. During this process, a solids-laden gas mixture<br>
comprised of the desired ("TiCl4") gas and residual solid chlorides is removed from the<br>
chlorinator, cooled, and conventionally is then transferred to a cyclone separator to remove<br>
the solids from the solids-laden gas mixture. The solids are then dumped into a suspension<br>
vessel, frequently referred to as a chlorinator sump, where the solids are mixed with water to<br>
form a uspension.<br>
These removed solids are typically very warm upon entering the suspension vessel.<br>
The mixing of these hot solids with water in the suspension vessel results in a high humidity<br>
gas phase in the space above the suspension in the vessel, including the length of pipe that<br>
carries the cyclone dust from the cyclone to the suspension vessel. The cyclone dust contains<br>
metal chlorides, which are hygroscopic, and as such become sticky when entering the high<br>
humidity areas of the pipe that transfers the cyclone dust from the cyclone to the suspension<br>
vessel. The sticky solids gradually build up on the walls of the pipe until the pipe is<br>
completely plugged, stopping further discharge of solids from the cyclone. Clearing the<br>
blockage requires operation downtime to unclog and can be a safety hazard.<br>
US 5,620,643 describes a process for producing fused particle<br>
agglomerates having improved coating properties and reduced dust generation<br>
during powder application, such as materials used for powder coating of metals.<br>
The apparatus used for carrying out the process feeds (by gravity) a<br>
compounded premixed powder material from a nozzle of a feed hopper into the<br>
first portion of a substantially transparent tubular powder processor. In the<br>
tubular powder processor, the powder encounters energy from one or more<br>
water-cooled, high-intensity light sources, which energy causes the particles of<br>
powder to soften and become tacky, so that they adhere to one another and<br>
emerge from a subsequent cooling section of the tubular powder processor as<br>
the desired agglomerated powder particles. To prevent the tacky particles from<br>
adhering to the inner wall of the tubular processor and to correspondingly<br>
facilitate the continued exposure of the particles to further light energy over a<br>
greater length of the processor, an air knife is illustrated for sweeping the internal<br>
surface of the first portion of the processor.<br>
However, the air knife of US 5,620,643 is an independent device<br>
introduced into the particulate passage at its entrance, whereas in the device<br>
according to the invention, which will be described and claimed hereinafter, the<br>
air knife is formed in the passage itself by a gap between overlapping wall<br>
sections of the passage. Consequently, while the air knife of US 5,620,643 must<br>
be at the entrance of the particulate passage, in the device according to the<br>
invention the gas that is supplied to prevent tacky particles from adhering to the<br>
interior walls of the passage (and to thus prevent fouling of the passage) can be<br>
supplied at any point in the passage where such help is needed, or at several<br>
such points.<br>
The present invention addresses the issues presented above by placing a novel air<br>
knife at or near the entrance to the suspension vessel. The cyclone dust passes through the air<br>
knife on its way to the suspension vessel. The novel air knife is circumferential. That is, the<br>
novel air knife injects a gas stream along the inside walls of the air knife. The gas stream is<br>
injected at a rate sufficient to reduce the buildup of hygroscopic cyclone dust on the walls of<br>
the air knife (and thus at the entrance to the chlorinator sump), so that the chlorinator sump<br>
can continue to receive solids from the cyclone, improving time-on-line and safety.<br>
In one embodiment, the present invention is a novel air knife adapted to reduce<br>
hygroscopic solids from building up at the entrance to a suspension vessel enclosing a high-<br>
humidity environment. In a second embodiment, the present invention is a method for<br>
preventing hygroscopic solids from building up at the entrance to a suspension vessel<br>
enclosing a high-humidity environment<br>
The present invention is illustrated by way of example in the following drawings in<br>
which like references indicate similar elements. The following drawings disclose various<br>
preferred embodiments of the present invention for purposes of illustration only and are not<br>
intended to limit the scope of the invention.<br>
FIG. 1 is a diagram of a ("TiCl4") production process.<br>
FIG. 2 illustrates a process utilizing an air knife according to the present invention in<br>
conjunction with a cyclone separator and a suspension vessel.<br>
FIG. 3 illustrates a cut-away view of an air knife according to the present invention.<br>
FIG. 4 illustrates a top-down view of the air knife shown in Figure 3.<br>
Figure 1 illustrates a schematic of a typical ("TiCl4") production process 100. The<br>
process 100 illustrated in Figure 1 involves chlorination of titanium-bearing ores. Ore 104<br>
and coke 106, preferably petroleum coke, are conveyed to a chlorinator 102 on a timed basis<br>
to maintain a certain bed level 108 and composition. Chlorine gas 110 is fed up to the bed<br>
through a distributor in the bottom of the chlorinator 102. The chlorinatiqn reaction occurs as<br>
the chlorine gas 110 flows up through the bed. Most of the titanium values in the bed are<br>
reacted to form ("TiCl4"). Metal oxides in the ore 104 largely are converted into gaseous metal<br>
chlorides. Other gases are also formed including carbon dioxide ("CO2") and carbon<br>
monoxide ("CO") Impurities in the ore are also chlorinated, forming chlorides such as FeCl2<br>
and MnCl2, for example.<br>
A hot reaction solids-laden gas mixture exits 112 from the chlorinator 102 and<br>
typically may comprise CO, CO2, COS, HC1,N2, low-boiling and high-boiling chlorides such<br>
as TiCl4, FeCl3, FeCl2, MnCl2, SnCl4, SiCl4, VOC13, NaAlCl4, and unreacted solids such as<br>
TiO2, SiO2 as well as unburned coke. The solids-laden gas mixture is cooled in a cooling<br>
conduit 114, sometimes referred to as a chlorinator crossover, and then sent to a cyclone<br>
separator 116 where the gases and solids are separated.<br>
Cyclone separators comprise well known means for separating gases and solids.<br>
Cyclone separators generally are constructed of the tubular or cylindrical-shaped main body<br>
connected to a lower tapered conical portion. A tangential side inlet is provided near the top<br>
of the cylindrical main body. A gas outlet tube is provided and generally extends<br>
downwardly through the cyclone top into the main body of the cyclone. The tube usually<br>
must extend down to a level slightly below the lowest portion of the inlet to assure efficient<br>
separation of solids and gases.<br>
In operation, the solids-laden gases are introduced at high velocity through the<br>
tangential inlet. They follow a vortex-shaped path around the outside of the gas outlet pipe<br>
downwardly towards the bottom of the separator. The solids, which are heavier than the<br>
gases, are thrown against the walls of the cyclone by centrifugal force. Gravity then causes<br>
the solids to fall to the bottom of the cyclone. The separated gas follows a vortex path<br>
upwardly and passes out of the top of the cyclone separator through the gas outlet tube. The<br>
separated solids flow through a solids outlet at the base of the tapered conical section. These<br>
separated solids are typically referred to as cyclone dust or waste solids.<br>
To minimize the amount of gas that is dumped along with the cyclone dust, a two-<br>
valve dump spool leg is typically used on the bottom of the cyclone. The opening and<br>
closing of these valves is interlocked so only one valve can possibly be open at any given<br>
time. When the top valve is opened, the bottom is closed. This allows cyclone dust to fall<br>
through the top valve and fill the dump spool leg. When the top valve closes, the bottom<br>
valve is opened to empty the dump spool leg to the suspension vessel. The valves<br>
continuously operate on a timer.<br>
In Figure 1, the solids-laden gas mixture flows from the chlorinator crossover 114<br>
into the cyclone 116 through a tangential inlet 118. The gases from the solids-laden gas<br>
mixture exit cyclone 116 through the gas outlet tube 120 at the top of the cyclone 116 and the<br>
solids exit the cyclone 116 through the dump spool leg 122 at the base of the cyclone 116.<br>
The cyclone dust collected at the bottom of the cyclone exits the bottom of the<br>
cyclone, is transported through a tube or pipe by force of gravity, and is deposited into a<br>
suspension vessel. The section of pipe connecting the cyclone and the suspension vessel can<br>
vary in length, typically being from about 20 feet to about 50 feet in length.<br>
The suspension vessel is frequently referred to as a chlorinator sump. Once<br>
deposited into the suspension vessel, the cyclone dust is mixed with water to form a<br>
suspension. Typically, any gas in the suspension vessel is removed through a vent in the top<br>
of the vessel and the suspension is pumped out of the vessel as waste or for further<br>
processing. Figure 1 shows the cyclone dust 124 entering the suspension vessel 132, water<br>
126 being added to the suspension vessel 132, gas 128 being removed from the suspension<br>
vessel 132, and suspension 130 being pumped out of the suspension vessel 132.<br>
The cyclone dust is typically very warm upon entering the suspension vessel. The<br>
mixing of these hot solids with water in the suspension vessel results in a high humidity gas<br>
phase in the space above the suspension in the vessel. This high-humidity environment can<br>
extend into the length of pipe that carries the cyclone dust from the cyclone to the suspension<br>
vessel. The cyclone dust contains metal chlorides, which are hygroscopic, and as such<br>
become sticky when entering the high humidity areas of the pipe that transfers the cyclone<br>
dust from the cyclone to the suspension vessel. The sticky solids gradually build up at the<br>
opening of the pipe into the suspension vessel or on the walls of the pipe until the pipe is<br>
completely plugged, stopping further discharge of solids from the cyclone.<br>
Clearing the blockage requires operation downtime to unclog and can be a safety<br>
hazard. Stopping the production process to clear a blockage is not only an economic<br>
disadvantage, allowing an operator access to the inside of the pipe to clear the blockage<br>
creates a risk of gas emissions. The blockage can also result in condensed ("TiCl4") being<br>
present, which can hydrolyze explosively should an operator try clearing the line with water.<br>
According to the present invention, a novel air knife is advantageously utilized to<br>
reduce or eliminate the buildup of hygroscopic materials on the inside of the pipe that<br>
transports the cyclone dust from the cyclone separator to the suspension vessel. The novel air<br>
knife is connected to the cyclone separator in the sense that the novel air knife is attached to<br>
the tube or pipe that transports cyclone dust from the cyclone to the suspension vessel in a<br>
manner that requires the cyclone dust to pass through the air knife either before the dust<br>
enters the suspension vessel or as the dust enters the suspension vessel. Preferably, the air<br>
knife is placed at or near the entrance to the suspension vessel.<br>
Air knives according to the present invention are circumferential. By circumferential<br>
it is meant that the air knife creates a stream of gas inside the air knife along the<br>
circumference of the passage in the air knife through which the cyclone dust passes.<br>
Typically, the pipe carrying the cyclone dust from the cyclone to the suspension vessel is<br>
circular and the inside of the air knife will have a circular passage through which the cyclone<br>
dust passes. However, the present invention is not so limited. Other geometric shapes are<br>
within the scope of the present invention. For example, the pipe transporting the cyclone dust<br>
and the inside passage of the air knife could be oval shaped or even rectangular.<br>
The gas stream created by air knives of the present invention has a velocity sufficient<br>
to blow most or all hygroscopic material from the inside wall of the air knife. In this manner,<br>
the air knife reduces the amount of hygroscopic material that can accumulate, significantly<br>
reducing the chance that the entrance to the suspension vessel can be blocked by accumulated<br>
hygroscopic material. When used in a ("TiCl4") production process to reduce cyclone dust<br>
accumulation, the gas stream will preferably have a velocity of at least 30 meters/second<br>
(100 feet per second), and more preferably, at least 60 meters per second (200 feet per<br>
second). Still more preferably, the gas stream will have a velocity of at least 120<br>
meters/second (400 feet per second). While some applications of the present invention may<br>
require a gas stream velocity of greater than 150 meters/second (500 feet per second),<br>
preferably the gas stream velocity is no more than 150 meters/second (500 feet per second).<br>
The gas stream created by the air knife generally travels in the same direction as the<br>
direction in which the hygroscopic material moves through the air knife. In one embodiment,<br>
the gas stream travels parallel to the direction of the hygroscopic material. However, it is<br>
within the scope of the present invention to adapt the air knife to create a gas stream that<br>
travels at an angle to the direction of the hygroscopic material, causing the gas stream to<br>
travel in a spiral motion when the air knife passage is circular.<br>
Figure 2 illustrates a process 200 utilizing an air knife 202 according to the present<br>
invention in conjunction with a cyclone separator 206 and a suspension vessel 204. The<br>
solids-laden gases are introduced into the cyclone separator 206 at the tangential inlet 208.<br>
Inside the cyclone separator 206 the solids and gases are separated. The gases exit the<br>
cyclone separator through a gas outlet tube 210 and gravity causes the solids to collect at the<br>
bottom 212 of the cyclone separator 206. A two-valve dump spool leg 214 minimizes the<br>
amount of gas that is dumped along with the cyclone dust. A pipe 216 connects the dump<br>
spool leg 214 with the air knife 202. Cyclone dust that is dumped from the two-valve dump<br>
spool leg 214 falls through the pipe 216 and through the air knife 202 into the suspension<br>
vessel 204.<br>
Figure 3 illustrates a cut away view of an air knife 300 according to the present<br>
invention. Hygroscopic material 302 enters the air knife 300 via a pipe 304 such as the pipe<br>
216 shown in Figure 2 and travels down through the air knife 300 in the direction indicated<br>
by the arrow 306.<br>
The air knife 300 comprises three overlapping wall sections 308,310, and 312. The<br>
overlapping portions of the wall sections form gaps through which gas is forced. The gaps<br>
face in the same direction in which the cyclone dust moves. By facing in the same direction<br>
it is meant that the gas forced through the gaps moves through the air knife in the same<br>
direction as the cyclone dust. Preferably, air knives of the present invention will comprise at<br>
least two different circumferential gaps through which gas is forced. Generally, the size of<br>
the gap (that is, the distance between two wall sections) is no more than 0.18 cm (0.07<br>
inches), and preferably no more than 0.13 cm (0.05 inches). In one embodiment, air knives<br>
having a gap size of 0.09 cm (0.036 inches) have been advantageously utilized in a ("TiCl4")<br>
production process to keep hygroscopic cyclone dust from accumulating on the walls of the<br>
air knife.<br>
Air knives according to the present invention have at least one gas intake. Typically,<br>
air knives of the present invention will have between two and four gas intakes. In Figure 2,<br>
gas flows into the gas intake 314 and travels in the direction indicated by the arrows. The gas<br>
is forced through the gaps between the wall sections 308,310, and 312 at a velocity sufficient<br>
to blow most or all hygroscopic material from the inside part of the wall sections 308,310,<br>
and 312 of the air knife. The gas velocity is calculated in a conventional manner, by dividing<br>
the gas flow into the gas intakes by the cross-sectional area of the circumferential gap.<br>
Figure 4 illustrates a top-down view of the air knife 300 shown in Figure 3. As seen<br>
in Figure 4, the air knife 300 has four gas intakes. The air knife 300 also comprises a series<br>
of bolts 316. The bolts 316 on this embodiment of the present invention are used to fasten<br>
the air knife 300 to a suspension vessel. However, other methods for attaching air knives to<br>
suspension vessels are within the scope of the present invention. Figure 4 also shows the<br>
opening 318 at the center of the air knife 300 through which the cyclone dust passes on its<br>
way to the suspension vessel. Air knives according to the present invention have been<br>
advantageously utilized at the entrance to a suspension vessel in a ("TiCl4") production process<br>
without requiring additional ventilation in the suspension vessel.<br>
As shown in Figure 4, the wall sections of the air knife 300 can be attached to each<br>
other by small spot welds 320 placed between the wall sections of the air knife 300. That is,<br>
these spot welds 320 are in the gaps between the wall sections. The size of the spots welds<br>
320 is not particularly critical so long as they are not so large as to interfere with the flow of<br>
gas through the gaps.<br>
Air knives of the present invention can be manufactured using any material suitable<br>
for the intended application. An appropriate material can be determined without undue<br>
experimentation. Typically, air knives utilized in a ("TiCl4") production process will be<br>
manufactured from a corrosion resistant alloy such as Inconel 600 or Inconel 601<br>
(commercially available from various steel and alloy distributors).<br>
Gases suitable for use with air knives of the present invention may depend on the<br>
particular application in which the air knife is used. However, appropriate gases can be<br>
determined without undue experimentation. Gases preferred for use with air knives in a<br>
("TiCl4") production process include air, nitrogen, argon, carbon dioxide or any other gas that<br>
will not appreciably react under the conditions prevailing in the air knife.<br>
While the present invention has been described in detail with respect to specific<br>
embodiments thereof, it will be appreciated that those skilled in the art, upon attaining an<br>
understanding of the foregoing, may readily conceive of alterations to, variations of, and<br>
equivalents to these embodiments. For example, air knives of the present invention can be<br>
5 advantageously utilized in applications in addition to the production of ("TiCl4") It is within the<br>
scope of the present invention to utilize the novel air knives of the presenfinvention in many<br>
applications benefiting from the present invention's ability to reduce buildup of materials<br>
during transport from one vessel to another, such as through a tube or pipe. Accordingly, the<br>

312) which define a circumferential passage through which the solids (302)<br>
pass, with at least two of the overlapping wall sections (308, 310 and 310,<br>
312) forming a gap between them facing in the flow direction (306), and a gas<br>
intake (314) connected to the gap so inert gases can be fed through the gap<br>
and along the circumference of the passage. The gases sweep clear the<br>
circumference of the passage in locations susceptible to solids buildup.</td>
