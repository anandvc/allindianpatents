				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.  Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a hand-held device (such as a mobile<br>
phone, PDA, or other mobile terminal), and more particularly to an apparatus for<br>
providing virtual graffiti using a touch-screen display for displaying information<br>
on its screen simultaneously with receiving user-entry data resulting from the user<br>
touching the screen.<br>
2. Description of the Related Art<br>
Conventional hand-held devices, such as for example, PDAs (Personal<br>
Digital Assistants) and smart phones where a PDA function is combined with a<br>
mobile terminal function, receive user-entry data from a touchpad. Particularly,<br>
a specific hand-held device (e.g., a smart phone) for receiving user-entry data<br>
from a keypad configured in the form of a 3x4 matrix keypad (i.e., ten number<br>
keys 0-9 and two function keys * and #) must enable a user to directly draw-<br>
desired numeric or character information on its touchpad. The number of overall<br>
keys contained in the keypad is limited to a predetermined number, whereby it is<br>
difficult for the user of the smart phone to effectively enter all the characters using<br>
only the keys contained in the keypad. Such a hand-held device capable of<br>
receiving numeric or character data generally contains a predetermined data entry<br>
area. The data entry area is called a graffiti area in the case of Palm OS<br>
(operating System).<br>
The first-generation PDA or smart phone has generally printed the graffiti<br>
area on a touchpad to implement a graffiti function as shown in Figs. 1 and 2.<br>
Fig. 1 is an exemplary view illustrating a touch-screen display 100 equipped with<br>
a graffiti area 108 printed on a touchpad 102. Fig. 2 is an exemplary<br>
configuration where a touchpad 202 equipped with a graffiti area 208 is separated<br>
from a touch-screen display 200. Generally, the touch-screen display 100 of Fig.<br>
1 and the touch-screen display 200 of Fig. 2 are constructed by covering an LCD<br>
(Liquid Crystal Display) panel for displaying images with a TSP (Touch-Sensitive<br>
Panel) for receiving user-entry data, respectively. Therefore, the touch-screen<br>
display 100 and the touch-screen display 200 can display information on their<br>
screens 104 and 204, and at the same time can receive user-entry as a result of the<br>
user touching the screens 104 and 204, respectively. Various application<br>
information is displayed on the screens 104 and 204 so that the user can view the<br>
displayed information. Figs. 1 and 2 show display formats of icons 106 and 206<br>
for executing a variety of applications. An icon 112 and a graffiti input box 110<br>
are printed on the graffiti area 108 of Fig. 1. An icon 212 and a graffiti input<br>
box 210 are printed on the graffiti area 208 of Fig. 2. The icons 112 and 212 are<br>
adapted to implement a graffiti function. The graffiti input boxes 110 and 210<br>
are adapted to receive graffiti entered by a user using a stylus pen.<br>
There has recently been proposed a virtual graffiti scheme as shown in Fig.<br>
3 A for implementing the graffiti area using a software program, and the virtual<br>
graffiti scheme has become increasingly popular as a substitute for a current<br>
mobile phone. The virtual graffiti scheme enables a user to draw desired images<br>
(i.e., graffiti) on a screen of a touch-screen display so that the drawn graffiti is<br>
displayed on the screen. If the virtual graffiti is implemented using the software<br>
program, a flexible GUI (Graphic User Interface) service can be established, and<br>
at the same time the virtual graffiti area can disappear from the screen when the<br>
graffiti function is unused, as shown in Fig. 3B, resulting in increased efficiency<br>
of screen use. Referring to Figs. 3 A and 3B, a graffiti area 304 is displayed on a<br>
screen 302 of the touch-screen display 300. The screen 302 includes a plurality<br>
of icons 306 for executing a variety of applications in the same way as in the<br>
screens 104 and 204 of Figs. 1 and 2. Similar to the graffiti areas 108 and 208 of<br>
Figs. 1 and 2, the graffiti area 304 includes a plurality of icons 310 for executing<br>
the graffiti function and a graffiti input box 308 for enabling the user to enter<br>
desired graffiti using a data entry tool such as a stylus pen.<br>
However, the graffiti implementation scheme for physically implementing<br>
the graffiti area as shown in Figs. 1 and 2 and the virtual graffiti implementation<br>
scheme for software implementation of the graffiti area as shown in Figs. 3 A and<br>
3B must assign additional dedicated areas or space to their graffiti areas.<br>
Hand-held devices must be a small-sized and lightweight communication terminal,<br>
such that the additional dedicated area for the graffiti area may encounter<br>
limitations due to the small-size and lightweight requirements. Particularly, in<br>
case of using a specific hand-held device having a screen where the size ratio of a<br>
width to a height is equal to 1:1 in a way similar to a folder-type smart phone, the<br>
specific hand-held device cannot use the graffiti function due to its use of a<br>
small-sized keyboard instead of the graffiti function.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Therefore, the present invention has been made in view of the above<br>
problems, and it is an object of the present invention to provide an apparatus and<br>
method for effectively implementing a graffiti function in a hand-held device<br>
limited in size, and a recording medium for the same.<br>
It is another object of the present invention to provide an apparatus and<br>
method which need not assign an additional area or space to a virtual graffiti area,<br>
and a recording medium for the same.<br>
It is yet another object of the present invention to provide an apparatus and<br>
method for providing a screen having a specific size ratio of 1:1 with a virtual<br>
graffiti function.<br>
In accordance with the present invention, the above and other objects can<br>
be accomplished by the provision of an apparatus for providing virtual graffiti,<br>
comprising: a touch-screen display for displaying information on its screen, and at<br>
the same time receiving user-entry data created by a user touching the screen; and<br>
a controller connected to the touch-screen display, which overlaps a graffiti screen<br>
image with a main screen image in a virtual graffiti area for providing a portion of<br>
the screen with the virtual graffiti, the controller classifies the user-entry data<br>
created by the user touching the screen into application execution entry data and<br>
graffiti entry data according to the touched position and/or a manner in which the<br>
user touches the screen, and processes the classified user-entry data according to<br>
its classification.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Now, preferred embodiments of the present invention will be described in<br>
detail with reference to the annexed drawings. In the drawings, the same or<br>
similar elements are denoted by the same reference numerals even though they are<br>
depicted in different drawings. In the following description, a detailed<br>
description of known functions and configurations incorporated herein will be<br>
omitted when it may make the subject matter of the present invention unclear.<br>
Referring to Figs. 4A and 4B showing examples for providing virtual<br>
graffiti, some parts of the screen 402 contained in the touch-screen display 400 are<br>
assigned to a virtual graffiti area 404 in such a way that it may provide a virtual<br>
graffiti function. If the virtual graffiti function of the present invention is<br>
enabled, a graffiti screen image and a main screen image are overlapped with each<br>
other in the virtual graffiti area 404 as shown in Fig. 4A. Otherwise, if the<br>
virtual graffiti function is disabled, only a main screen image is displayed, as<br>
shown in Fig. 4B. Similar to images displayed on screens 104, 204, and 302 of<br>
Figs. 1, 2, 3 A and 3B, respectively, the main screen image of Fig. 4B indicates an<br>
image generated by the execution of an OS (Operating System) or various<br>
applications. Similar to the graffiti area 304 of Fig. 3 A, the graffiti screen image<br>
of Fig. 4A indicates an image displayed to provide a user with a virtual graffiti<br>
function. The virtual graffiti area 404 of Fig. 4A is partially overlapped with the<br>
screen 402, whereas the graffiti area of Fig. 3A is used as a dedicated area for<br>
virtual graffiti. Therefore, as shown in Fig. 4A, some icons 412 contained in the<br>
plurality of icons needed for the execution of various applications are overlapped<br>
with a graffiti screen image whereas the other icons 406 are displayed on the<br>
screen 402 without any change. In more detail, in the same way as in Fig. 3A,<br>
the virtual graffiti area 404 includes a plurality of icons 410 needed for the graffiti<br>
function and a graffiti input box 408 for receiving graffiti generated by the user<br>
touching box 408 using a stylus pen. The graffiti input box 408 is overlapped<br>
with the main screen image so that it is translucently displayed on the main screen<br>
image.<br>
Fig 5 is a block diagram illustrating an apparatus for providing the virtual<br>
graffiti function in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present<br>
invention. Referring to Fig. 5, a touch-screen display 500 corresponds to the<br>
touch-screen displays 400 of Figs. 4A and 4B, and includes an LCD (Liquid<br>
Crystal Display) 504 for displaying images thereon and a TSP (Touch-Sensitive<br>
Panel) 502 for receiving user-entry data from a user. The touch-screen display<br>
500 generally is constructed such that the LCD 504 is covered with the TSP 502,<br>
so as to display information on the screen 402 of Figs. 4A and 4B and at the same<br>
time can receive user-entry data as a result of the user touching the screen 402.<br>
A controller 506 connected to the touch-screen display 500 overlaps the<br>
graffiti screen image with the main screen image, and displays the overlapped<br>
image on the virtual graffiti area 404. The controller 506 classifies user-entry<br>
data created by the user touching the screen 402 into application execution entry<br>
data and graffiti entry data according to the user's touch position and/or the user's<br>
touch method, and processes the application execution entry data and the graffiti<br>
entry data differently from each other. The controller 506 includes an ADC<br>
(Analog-to-Digital Converter) 512, a memory 514, a DMA (Direct Memory<br>
Access) controller 522, an LCD (Liquid Crystal Display) controller 524, a CPU<br>
(Central Processing Unit) 508, and a host interface 510., The ADC 512, the<br>
memory 514, the DMA controller 522, and the LCD controller 524 are connected<br>
to the CPU (Central Processing Unit) 508 via the host interface 510.<br>
The ADC 512 is connected to the TSP 502 of the touch-screen display 500,<br>
converts an analog user-entry signal created by the user touching the screen 402<br>
into a digital signal, and transmits the digital signal to the CPU 508 via the host<br>
interface 510. The LCD controller 524, acting as a display controller, is<br>
connected to the LCD 504 of the touch-screen display 500 while simultaneously<br>
being connected to the DMA controller 522, drives the LCD 504 upon receiving<br>
video data from the DMA controller 522, and displays an image corresponding to<br>
the received video data on the screen 402.<br>
The memory 514 includes first and second video buffers 516 and 518 and a<br>
graffiti screen memory 520, and stores video data by means of the CPU 508.<br>
The graffiti screen memory 520 stores video data of the graffiti screen image. The<br>
first video buffer 516 stores video data of the main screen image displayed on the<br>
screen 402. The second video buffer 518 stores the overlapped video data where<br>
the graffiti screen image is overlapped with the main screen image. The<br>
overlapped area occupies a portion of the main screen image, and corresponds to a<br>
virtual graffiti area 404 as shown in Fig. 4A. In this way, individual video data<br>
stored in the first and second video buffers 516 and 518 are selectively read by the<br>
DMA controller 522 upon receiving a control signal from the CPU 508, and the<br>
read data is transmitted to the LCD controller 524.<br>
The CPU 508 processes user-entry data received from the ADC 512,<br>
selectively updates the video data of the first and second video buffers 516 and<br>
518 according to the user-entry data, and controls a selective video data readout<br>
operation of the DMA controller 522 on the basis of specific information<br>
indicative of an enable or disable state of the virtual graffiti function upon receipt<br>
of a user's selection signal.<br>
A display update process for the CPU 508 for use in the apparatus of Fig. 5<br>
is described in Fig. 6. A method for displaying images on the screen 402 to<br>
provide a user with a virtual graffiti function will hereinafter be described with<br>
reference to Fig. 7. The CPU 508 begins to perform operations of Fig. 6<br>
according to a predetermined condition, and determines whether there is a need<br>
for the screen 402 to display an image thereon at step 600. There are a variety of<br>
startup conditions of the above CPU 508 's operation, for example, a first<br>
condition where the user enters desired data on the screen 402 using a<br>
screen-touch method, a second condition where a current time reaches a periodic<br>
display update time determined by an OS(Operating System)timer, a third<br>
condition where display update operations are required due to the execution of<br>
various applications, etc.<br>
If it is determined that such a display update operation is currently required<br>
at step 600, the CPU 508 updates data of the first video buffer 516 with a main<br>
screen image of Fig. 7(a) at step 602. Therefore, the first video buffer 516 stores<br>
video data of a specific image to be displayed on the screen 402 according to an<br>
OS or current active application. The CPU 508 determines if the virtual graffiti<br>
function is enabled or not at step 604. The enable or disable operation of the<br>
virtual graffiti function is selected by the user. If the user wishes to enter graffiti<br>
on the screen, the virtual graffiti function is enabled. Otherwise, if the user does<br>
not wish to enter graffiti on the screen, the virtual graffiti function is disabled.<br>
In this way, the user can freely select either one of two modes (i.e., the virtual<br>
graffiti enable mode and the virtual graffiti disable mode) in the same way as in<br>
Figs. 3A and 3B.<br>
If it is determined that the virtual graffiti function is enabled at step 604,<br>
the CPU 508 goes to step 606. Otherwise, if it is determined that the virtual<br>
graffiti function is disabled at step 604, the CPU 508 goes to step 614. The main<br>
screen image (e.g., Fig. 7(a)) stored in the first video buffer 516 is overlapped<br>
with a graffiti screen image (e.g., Fig. 7(b)) stored in the graffiti screen memory<br>
520 using an alpha-blending method at step 606, such that the overlapped result is<br>
configured in the form of a specific image (e.g., Fig. 7(c)). The overlapped<br>
image is stored in the second video buffer 518 in such a way that the second video<br>
buffer 518 can be updated at step 606. In this case, the graffiti screen memory<br>
520 is designed to pre-store the graffiti screen image of Fig. 7(b) in the form of a<br>
bitmap file or database. Therefore, the graffiti screen image can be replaced<br>
with a user-desired image, and the user can freely set up attribution (e.g., shape,<br>
size, and color, etc.) of the graffiti screen image. In order to provide the user<br>
with the graffiti screen image setup service, a user-setting window is provided on<br>
the screen in the same way as in a general image setup scheme, so that the user<br>
can freely change data displayed on the screen. Furthermore, the user can freely<br>
set up other attribution (e.g., position and transparency) of the virtual graffiti area<br>
404 using the user-setting window. In this case, using an alpha-blending method,<br>
the main screen image is combined with the graffiti screen image at a<br>
predetermined overlap ratio varying with the setup transparency. For example,<br>
provided that the transparency of the graffiti screen image associated with the<br>
main screen image is set to 0.7 using a user-selection value or default value, a<br>
pixel value of the main screen image and the other pixel value of the graffiti<br>
screen image are blended with each other at a predetermined ratio of 7:3.<br>
After the second video buffer 518 has been updated at step 606, the CPU<br>
508 determines whether a stroke-inking operation is required at step 608. In the<br>
case where the user writes desired graffiti on the screen using screen-touch action<br>
to generate user's strokes, the stroke-inking operation is adapted to display the<br>
user's strokes on the virtual graffiti area 404 as shown in Fig. 7(d). In this case,<br>
the user can freely set up a variety of attribution (e.g., stroke-inking enable/disable<br>
state, color, transparency, etc.) using the user-setting window. Provided that the<br>
stroke-inking process is set up and the user writes desired data on the screen using<br>
screen-touch action, the CPU 508 generates a stroke-inking image caused by the<br>
user's stroke at step 610, stores the image in the second video buffer 518, and<br>
goes to step 612. Therefore, the stroke-inking image (e.g., Fig. 7(d)) is<br>
overlapped with the overlapped image (e.g., Fig. 7(c)) between the main screen<br>
image and the graffiti screen image. As shown in Fig. 7(d), a stroke-inking<br>
image of 2 is overlapped with the image of Fig. 7(c) when the user records a<br>
specific number 2 on the screen. Provided that the stroke-inking process is not<br>
set up and the user does not write desired data on the screen, the CPU 508 jumps<br>
from step 608 to step 612 without passing through step 610.<br>
The DMA controller 522 transmits video data stored in the second video<br>
buffer 518 to the LCD controller 524 in such a way that a display update operation<br>
can be established at step 612. In this case, if the stroke-inking process of step<br>
610 is not performed, the DMA controller 522 transmits the video data of Fig.<br>
7(c) equal to the overlapped image between the main screen image and the graffiti<br>
screen image to the LCD controller 524, such that the video image of Fig. 7(c) is<br>
displayed on the screen 402. Otherwise, if the stroke-inking process of step 610<br>
is performed, the DMA controller 522 transmits the video data of Fig. 7(d) where<br>
the stroke-inking image is overlapped with the overlapped image between the<br>
main screen image and the graffiti screen image to the LCD controller 524, such<br>
that the video image of Fig. 7(d) is displayed on the screen 402.<br>
If it is determined that the virtual graffiti function is disabled at step 604,<br>
the DMA controller 522 transmits video data stored in the first video buffer 516 to<br>
the LCD controller 524 at step 614 so that a display update operation can be<br>
established. In other words, the DMA controller 522 transmits video data<br>
composed of only the main screen image of Fig. 7(a) to the LCD controller 524,<br>
such that a specific image having no virtual graffiti is displayed on the screen 402<br>
as shown in Fig. 7(a).<br>
The main screen image and the graffiti screen image are overlapped with<br>
each other in the virtual graffiti area 404. Accordingly, upon receiving<br>
user-entry data from the virtual graffiti area 404 contained in the screen 402, the<br>
CPU 508 must determine whether the received user-entry data is either entry data<br>
for application execution or graffiti entry data, and must process the received<br>
user-entry data according to the determined result. For this purpose, the CPU<br>
508 classifies the user-entry data into application execution entry data and graffiti<br>
entry data according to a user's touch position and/or user's touch action, and<br>
differently processes the classified data. For example, if the user touches the<br>
screen 402 with a stylus pen and does not move the stylus pen contacted with the<br>
screen 402 during a predetermined time, the CPU 508 determines that the<br>
user-entry data is application execution entry data. In more detail, provided that<br>
a user's stylus pen touches the application icon 412 contained in the overlapped<br>
image between the main screen image and the graffiti screen image and remains at<br>
the touched position without any movement during a predetermined time, the<br>
CPU 508 executes an application program corresponding to the touched icon 412.<br>
In a different manner from the example shown in Fig. 4A, the<br>
aforementioned method for executing the application program may also be<br>
adapted to another case where another application program different from the<br>
application program has already been executed, and may also be easily<br>
implemented using buttons currently displayed on the virtual graffiti area 404 of<br>
the screen 402 according to a current execution application program. On the<br>
other hand, provided that the user touches the screen 402 using the stylus pen,<br>
moves the stylus pen contacted with the screen 402 to another place of the screen<br>
402, or takes the stylus pen off of the screen 402 before a predetermined time<br>
elapses, the CPU 508 determines that the user-entry data is graffiti entry data. In<br>
more detail, although the user's stylus pen touches the application icon 412<br>
contained in the overlapped image between the main screen image and the graffiti<br>
screen image, if the user moves the stylus pen contacted with the screen 402 to<br>
another place on the screen 402, or takes the stylus pen off of the screen 402<br>
before a predetermined time elapses, the CPU does not execute the application<br>
program corresponding to the icon 412 and determines that the user-entry data is<br>
graffiti entry data. In the case of recognizing the user-entry data as graffiti entry<br>
data, the graffiti entry data can be classified into two touch data units composed of<br>
first touch data created by the user touching the graffiti input box 412 and second<br>
touch data created by the user touching the graffiti icons 410. In more detail, if<br>
the user touches any place contained in the graffiti input box 412 using the stylus<br>
pen, and either moves the stylus pen contacted with the screen to another place or<br>
takes the stylus pen out of the screen before a predetermined time elapses, the<br>
CPU 508 determines that the user enters graffiti in the graffiti input box 412,<br>
resulting in the creation of the first touch data. If the user touches either the<br>
overlapped image between the application icon and the graffiti icon or only the<br>
graffiti icon using the stylus pen and takes the stylus pen off of the screen before a<br>
predetermined time elapses, the CPU 508 executes a program corresponding to<br>
the touched graffiti icon.<br>
An exemplary method for controlling the CPU 508 to differently recognize<br>
the user-entry data resulting from the user touching the screen and process the<br>
differently-recognized data will hereinafter be described with reference to Fig. 8.<br>
Referring to Fig. 8, upon receiving user entry data resulting from the user<br>
touching the screen at step 700, the CPU 508 determines whether the touched<br>
position is contained in the virtual graffiti area 404 at step 702. If it is<br>
determined that the touched position is outside of the virtual graffiti area 404 at<br>
step 702, the corresponding touched position indicates a desire to execute an<br>
application program, so that the CPU 508 recognizes the user's touch data as entry<br>
data for application execution at step 706 and processes the application execution<br>
entry data. If the touched position is positioned in the virtual graffiti area 404 at<br>
step 702, the user's touch data may function as the application execution entry<br>
data or the graffiti entry data. Therefore, the CPU 508 determines if a duration<br>
time of the user touching a single point is longer than a predetermined time T at<br>
step 704. In this case, the user's touch duration time is called a fixed touch time,<br>
and indicates a predetermined time during which the user's stylus pen touches one<br>
point of the screen 402 and remains at the touched point without any movement.<br>
If the fixed touch time is longer than the predetermined time T at step 704, it is<br>
determined that the user-entry data generated by the user's touch is application<br>
execution entry data by the CPU 508 at step 706 and CPU 508 processes the<br>
recognized data. Otherwise, if the fixed touch time is shorter than a<br>
predetermined time T, it is determined that the user-entry data is equal to either the<br>
first touch data created by the user touching the graffiti input box 412 or the<br>
second touch data created by the user touching the graffiti icons 410, and the CPU<br>
508 recognizes the user-entry data as graffiti entry data at step 708 and performs a<br>
corresponding process. In this case, if the touched position is in the graffiti input<br>
box 408, the CPU 508 recognizes the user-entry data as the first touch data<br>
indicative of graffiti entry data, and performs a corresponding process.<br>
Otherwise, if the touched position is outside of the graffiti input box 408, the CPU<br>
508 performs an application program associated with a corresponding graffiti icon<br>
410.<br>
Therefore, a virtual graffiti area is set up in some parts of the screen of the<br>
touch-screen display, a graffiti screen image is overlapped with a main screen<br>
image in the virtual graffiti area, the overlapped image between the main screen<br>
image and the graffiti screen image is displayed on the virtual graffiti area, and<br>
user-entry data created by the user touching the screen is classified into<br>
application entry data and graffiti entry data according to the user's touch position<br>
and/or the user's touch method, such that the classified entry data units are<br>
processed differently. In this way, the virtual graffiti area can display application<br>
or virtual graffiti data, and can selectively execute either one of application data<br>
and virtual graffiti data while the user's touch for entering the application or<br>
virtual graffiti data remains in an active state, such that there is no need to require<br>
an additional area or space needed for providing a terminal with the virtual graffiti<br>
area. Therefore, a hand-held device limited in size can effectively implement a<br>
graffiti function, and can provide even a screen having a size ratio of 1:1 with<br>
virtual graffiti.<br>
As is apparent from the above description, the method for providing virtual<br>
graffiti according to the present invention can be implemented with a<br>
computer-readable recording medium storing an execution program, and the<br>
computer-readable recording medium having the execution program is contained<br>
in an apparatus equipped with a CPU and a touch-screen display. In this case,<br>
the touch-screen display can receive user-entry data as a result of the user<br>
touching the screen, and at the same time can display information on the screen.<br>
In the case of performing a stroke-inking process, the present invention enables<br>
the controller to automatically determine color and transparency of user's stroke<br>
image on the basis of background color of the screen, such that the user's stroke<br>
image can be easily distinguished from the background color, resulting in an<br>
increased visual recognition degree of the user's stroke image.<br>
Although the preferred embodiments of the present invention have been<br>
disclosed for illustrative purposes, those skilled in the art will appreciate that<br>
various modifications, additions and substitutions are possible, without departing<br>
from the scope and spirit of the invention as disclosed in the accompanying<br>
