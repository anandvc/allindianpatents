				<td>CAPACITOR WITH DIRECT DC CONNECTION TO SUBSTRATE<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001] The present invention generally relates to power inverter<br>
modules, and more particularly relates to a subcomponent of a power<br>
inverter module, including a capacitor with a direct, direct current (DC)<br>
connection to a switch device which is integrated into or deposited over a<br>
substrate.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002] Power inverter modules are commonly used in many applications.<br>
The automotive industry, for example, makes use of power inverters to<br>
convert direct current (DC) which is supplied from a battery to alternating<br>
current (AC) which is used to supply power to such devices as electric<br>
motors and traction drive systems.<br>
[0003] Power inverter modules include a capacitor device, such as a so-<br>
called "DC link" capacitor, which is placed between a power semiconductor<br>
switch and the DC power supply. Use of a capacitor serves to steady input<br>
voltage variation.<br>
[0004] Many high power-density power inverter modules employ liquid<br>
cooling, where the power switches are mounted on a liquid-cooled heat sink.<br>
The capacitor is placed adjacent to the switches. This increases the footprint<br>
of the overall package, and the length of the busbars between the capacitor<br>
and the switches, thereby increasing the package volume and the inductance<br>
of the busbar.<br>
[0005] Accordingly, it is desirable to implement a design which places<br>
the capacitor as close to the switches as possible, which reduces the length of<br>
the busbar connections and the associated inductance of the busbar<br>
connections In addition, such a design should minimize the expenditure of<br>
additional resources and additional complexity. Furthermore, other desirable<br>
features and characteristics of the present invention will become apparent<br>
from the subsequent detailed description and the appended claims, taken in<br>
conjunction with the accompanying drawings and the foregoing technical<br>
field and background.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0006] In one embodiment, a subcomponent for a power inverter module<br>
is provided. A capacitor has a terminal and is integrated into a housing. A<br>
substrate is mounted on the housing. The substrate incorporating a power<br>
semiconductor switch and having at least one direct current (DC) tab. The at<br>
least one direct current tab is directly connected to the terminal of the<br>
capacitor.<br>
[0007] In an additional embodiment, an apparatus is provided for a<br>
power inverter module component, including a housing. A capacitor is<br>
integrated into the housing and has an output terminal. A semiconductor<br>
switch device is integrated into a substrate and disposed over the housing.<br>
The substrate has an input tab structure. The input tab structure is directly<br>
coupled to the output terminal.<br>
[0008] In still another embodiment, an apparatus is provided for a power<br>
inverter module. A capacitor is integrated into a housing. The capacitor has<br>
a plurality of output terminal leads corresponding to each of a plurality of<br>
direct current (D/C) connections. A plurality of semiconductor switch<br>
devices are disposed over a plurality of substrates and mounted over the<br>
housing. Each of the plurality of semiconductor switch devices is coupled to<br>
a plurality of input terminals extending from the plurality of substrates.<br>
Each of the plurality of input terminals are directly coupled to each of the<br>
plurality of output terminal leads.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF AN EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENT<br>
[0017] The following detailed description is merely exemplary in nature<br>
and is not intended to limit the invention or the application and uses of the<br>
invention. Furthermore, there is no intention to be bound by any expressed<br>
or implied theory presented in the preceding technical field, background,<br>
brief summary or the following detailed description.<br>
[0018] FIG. 1 illustrates an exemplary schematic diagram of a three-<br>
phase power inverter circuit 10. Power inverter circuit 10 provides the<br>
previously described conversion of input DC power to an AC load, such as<br>
an electric motor. A DC power source is coupled to DC- and DC+ input<br>
terminals 12. A capacitor 14, such as the previously described DC link<br>
capacitor 14, is placed across the DC- and DC+ terminals 12. An output<br>
terminal of the capacitor 14 is connected to a transistor 16, such as an<br>
insulated gate bipolar transistor (IGBT) 16. The transistor is coupled in<br>
parallel with a diode 18 and controlled by a gate drive and control printed<br>
circuit board (PCB) (i.e., a controller). A series of two transistors 16 and<br>
diodes 18 make up a leg 22 of a three-phase switch device. Each of the<br>
three legs 22 are coupled to an AC output 26 representing an A, B, and C<br>
phase respectively. Again, it is desirable to limit the connections (e.g., lead<br>
17) between the capacitor 14 and the switches 22, which reduces the length<br>
of corresponding busbar connections and the associated inductance of these<br>
busbar connections.<br>
[0019] Turning to FIG. 2, an exemplary portion 28 of a power inverter<br>
device is depicted. Portion 28 includes a capacitor which is mounted over a<br>
heatsink 30, commonly referred to as a "coldplate" 30. A series of power<br>
semiconductor switches 22 corresponding to each leg of the three-phase<br>
inverter are mounted adjacent to the capacitor 14.<br>
[0020] The switches 22 include, again, a series of transistors 16 and<br>
diodes 18 which can be incorporated into one or more semiconductor dies.<br>
The switches 22, and thereby, the respective semiconductor dies, can be<br>
disposed over or integrated into a substrate. In one embodiment, the<br>
substrate can include a ceramic dielectric layer (i.e., aluminum nitride or<br>
aluminum oxide) which is sandwiched between two layers of copper. The<br>
substrate allows for electrical isolation of the switches 22. However, the<br>
substrate thermally conducts heat generated by the switches 22 through to the<br>
coldplate 30. A busbar (not shown), which is enclosed by the coldplate 30,<br>
electrically couples output terminals of the capacitor with input terminals of<br>
the switches 22.<br>
[0021] FIG. 3 illustrates a top view representation of the configuration of<br>
portion 28 shown in FIG. 2. Here again, the capacitor 14 is mounted over<br>
the coldplate 30. The switches 22 are mounted to the coldplate 30 and<br>
adjacent to the capacitor 14 as shown. By mounting the switches adjacent to<br>
the capacitor, the length of the busbars connecting the capacitor and switches<br>
can contribute to such undesirable characteristics as signal losses and<br>
parasitic effects such as parasitic inductance of the busbar. In addition, the<br>
footprint of the package 28 is increased, resulting in an increased package 28<br>
volume.<br>
[0022] FIG. 4 illustrates, conceptually and in accordance with the<br>
claimed subject matter, an implementation 32 where switches 38 are<br>
mounted over a capacitor 36. In the depicted embodiment, substrates 39,<br>
over which switches 38 are disposed or integrated, are seen.<br>
[0023] In previously depicted FIGs. 2 and 3, a motivation for positioning<br>
a substrate including the switches 22 adjacent to the capacitor 14 was to<br>
provide for thermal conductivity of the heat generated by switches 22 into<br>
the coldplate 30. However, switches 22 and their integrated dies can be<br>
cooled from a top surface or the coldplate 30 sandwiched between the<br>
underside of the substrate and the top of the capacitor 14. One such method<br>
of cooling may involve utilizing a dielectric fluid which is sprayed on a top<br>
surface of the switches 22 and processed through a heat exchanger device.<br>
As one skilled in the art will appreciate, however, a variety of cooling<br>
techniques may be implemented to provide cooling to the top surface of the<br>
switches, and thereby alleviate a requirement of a coldplate 30 for thermal<br>
dissipation. In light of the described change in cooling techniques, a chassis<br>
34 can be used to provide structural support to the capacitor 36 and switches<br>
38 for implementation 32 instead of coldplate 30. As such, in the depicted<br>
embodiment, chassis 34 represents conceptually the replacement of a<br>
coldplate 30 with a chassis 34 to continue to provide structural support.<br>
However, in other embodiments, as will be seen, a chassis 34 is not<br>
necessary, as mechanical isolation can be provided through the use of a<br>
housing integrated over the capacitor.<br>
[0024] FIG. 5 illustrates a top view representation of the implementation<br>
32. Again switches 38 and substrates 39 are mounted directly to the<br>
capacitor 36. An output terminal of the capacitor 36 is directly connected to<br>
an input terminal of the substrate 39. As such, inductance between the<br>
capacitor and the substrates 39 and switches 38 is minimized. Here again,<br>
the switches 38 and substrates 39 are removed from adjacent the capacitor<br>
36, freeing the surface area of the chassis 34 which would have been<br>
associated with the switches 38 and substrates 39. As a result, the footprint<br>
of implementation 32, and corresponding volume of implementation 32 can<br>
be made smaller, as the chassis 34 can be removed in other embodiments.<br>
[0025] FIG. 6 illustrates the result of removing a chassis to reduce the<br>
footprint of implementation 32, in an exemplary inverter component 40. A<br>
capacitor (not shown) may be integrated into or enclosed by a housing<br>
structure 42. A top surface 43 of the housing 42 may be conformed to<br>
receive a bottom surface of the substrates. The capacitor, and thereby, the<br>
housing 42 can be configured for a variety of applications. In the depicted<br>
embodiment 40, the capacitor and housing 42 are circularly disposed about<br>
an axis 44. Again, however, the capacitor and housing 42 can be configured<br>
in a variety of shapes and sizes. In one embodiment, the housing 42<br>
provides vibration isolation to the capacitor, taking the place of a coldplate<br>
30 or chassis 34. The housing 42 can be formed of a rigid thermoplastic<br>
material to provide adequate structural support to the capacitor and switch<br>
devices.<br>
[0026] A series of output terminals 46 are formed over the substrate as<br>
shown. The terminals 46 may be square-shaped and flat as shown, or may<br>
be tailored for a specific application. The terminals 46 extend through the<br>
housing to connect with the capacitor. Similarly, input terminals of the<br>
capacitor can extend through the housing and be formed into bus terminal<br>
structures 48 (e.g., DC+ and DC-), for electrical connection to a DC power<br>
source. Busbars 48 are coplanar just under the substrate and the housing to<br>
reduce inductance.<br>
[0027] Turning to FIG. 7, an exemplary inverter component assembly 50<br>
is depicted, which includes the previously illustrated component 40 with a<br>
series of switches 52 mounted thereon. The switches 52 are again, disposed<br>
over or integrated into a substrate 53, for structural support. Thermal<br>
cooling of the switches / dies 52 can be provided through a top surface<br>
cooling technique as previously described or the sandwiched configuration as<br>
previously described.<br>
[0028] As seen, various input terminals of switches 52 and substrates 53<br>
can be formed into tab structures 54, which extend out of, or from, the<br>
substrates 53 as seen. The physical structure of the tabs 54 can be formed to<br>
directly correlate with the output terminals 46 of the capacitor. For<br>
example, in FIG. 6, terminals 46 are square and substantially flat, having a<br>
series of mounting holes 47. Similarly, tabs 54 as depicted in FIG. 7 are<br>
square and substantially flat, where the mounting holes 55 of tabs 54<br>
correspond (e.g., line up) to mounting holes 47 of terminals 46 for attaching<br>
a screw or bolt mechanism. As will be appreciated, however, other<br>
techniques, such as soldering and welding, can be used to directly join the<br>
tabs 54 with the terminals 46.<br>
[0029] Direct connection of the tabs 54 with the terminals 46<br>
substantially reduces or eliminates a busbar connection between the switches<br>
52 and the capacitor. In the depicted embodiment 50, a series of fin<br>
structures 56 are integrated into the switches 52, and may be electrically<br>
incorporated into the substrates 53 (i.e., electrical paths formed through the<br>
substrate itself). Fins 56 may serve as the output terminals of the switches<br>
52, providing an AC output for each respective leg / phase of a three-phase<br>
AC circuit. The fins 56 can be coupled to a motor or other load which uses<br>
the AC power.<br>
[0030] By directly connecting the tabs 54 with the terminals 46, a<br>
minimum device 50 footprint and volume may be obtained. Again, a busbar<br>
connection and/or lead length may be reduced, which reduces associated<br>
inductance and increases the overall inverter performance. In addition, the<br>
component 50 has a reduced part count, resulting in a lower cost of<br>
fabrication.<br>
[0031] While at least one exemplary embodiment has been presented in<br>
the foregoing detailed description, it should be appreciated that a vast<br>
number of variations exist. It should also be appreciated that the exemplary<br>
embodiment or exemplary embodiments are only examples, and are not<br>
intended to limit the scope, applicability, or configuration of the invention in<br>
any way. Rather, the foregoing detailed description will provide those<br>
skilled in the art with a convenient road map for implementing the exemplary<br>
embodiment or exemplary embodiments. It should be understood that<br>
various changes can be made in the function and arrangement of elements<br>
