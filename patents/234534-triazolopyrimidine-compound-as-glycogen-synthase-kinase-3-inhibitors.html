The present invention also relates to the use of a compound of formula (I) for the manufacture of a medicament for the prevention or the treatment of diseases mediated through GSK3.<br>
As used herein Q.salkyl as a group or part of a group defines straight or branched chain saturated hydrocarbon radicals having from 1 to 3 carbon atoms such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, 1-methylethyl; C1-6alkyl as a group or part of a group defines straight or branched chain saturated hydrocarbon radicals having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms such as the groups defined for C1-6alkyl and butyl; C1-6alkyl as a group or part of a group<br><br>
defines straight or branched chain saturated hydrocarbon radicals having from 1 to 6 carbon atoms such as the groups defined for Chalky! and pentyl, hexyl, 2-methylbutyl and the like; C2-4alkenyl as a group or part of a group defines straight and branched chain hydrocarbon radicals having from 2 to 4 carbon atoms containing a double bond such as ethenyl, propenyl, butenyl and the like; Ca^alkenyl as a group or part of a group defines straight and branched chain hydrocarbon radicals having from 2 to 6 carbon atoms containing a double bond such as the groups defined for Ca^alkenyl and pentenyl, hexenyl and the like; C2^alkynyl as a group or part of a group defines straight and branched chain hydrocarbon radicals having from 2 to 4 carbon atoms containing a triple bond such as ethynyl, propynyl, butynyl and the like; Ca-ealkynyl as a group or part of a group defines straight and branched chain hydrocarbon radicals having from 2 to 6 carbon atoms containing a triple bond such as the group defined for C24alkynyl and pentynyl, hexynyl and the like; Cs^cycloalkyl is generic to cyclo-propyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl and cycloheptyl; a 4, 5,6- or 7-membered monocyclic heterocycle containing at least one heteroatom selected from O, S or N comprises saturated, partially saturated or aromatic 4,5,6- or 7-membered monocyclic heterocycles containing at least one heteroatom selected from O, N or S; saturated heterocyles are heterocycles containing only single bonds; partially saturated heterocycles are heterocycles containing at least one double bond provided that the ring system is not an aromatic ring system; the term aromatic is well known to a person skilled in the art and designates cyclically conjugated systems of 4n' + 2 electrons, that is with 6,10,14 etc. TC-electrons (rule of Hiickel; n' being 1,2,3 etc.).<br>
Particular examples of 4, 5,6- or 7-membered saturated monocyclic heterocycles are azetidinyl, oxetanyl, tetrahydrofuranyl, pyrrolidinyl, dioxolanyl, imidazolidinyl, thiazolidinyl, tetrahydrothienyl, dihydrooxazolyl, isothiazolidinyl, isoxazolidinyl, oxadiazolidinyl, triazolidinyl, thiadiazolidinyl, pyrazolidinyl, piperidinyl, hexahydropyrimidinyl, hexahydropyridazinyl, dioxanyl, morpholinyl, dithianyl, thiomorpholinyl, piperazinyl, homopiperidinyl (azepanyl), [l,3]diazepanyl, homopiperazinyl ([l,4]diazepanyl), [l,2]diazepanyl, oxepanyl, dioxepanyl.<br>
Particular examples of 5- or 6-membered partially saturated heterocycles are pyrrolinyl, imidazolinyl, pyrazolinyl and the like.<br>
Particular examples of 4,5,6- or 7-m.embered aromatic monocyclic heterocycles are pyrrolyl, furyl, thienyl, imidazolyl, oxazolyl, isoxazolyl, thiazolyl, isothiazolyl,<br>
pyrazolyl, tnazolyl, thiadiazolyl, oxadiazolyl, tetrazolyl,pyridyl, pyrimidinyl, pyrazinyl, pyridazinyl.<br>
As used herein before, the term (=0) forms a carbonyl moiety when attached to a carbon atom, a sulfoxide moiety when attached to a sulfur atom and a sulfonyl moiety when two of said terms are attached to a sulfur atom.<br>
The term halo is generic to fluoro, chloro, bromo and iodo. As used in the foregoing and hereinafter, polyhaloC1-6alkyl and polyhaloC1-6alkyl as a group or part of a group are defined as mono- or polyhalosubstituted Cualkyl or Cj-ealkyl, for example, methyl substituted with one or more fluoro atoms, for example, difluoromethyl or trifluoromethyl, 1,1-difluoro-ethyl and the like. In case more than one halogen atoms are attached to an alkyl group within the definition of polyhaloC1-6alkyl or polyhaloCj-galkyl, they may be the same or different.<br>
The term heterocycle as in the definition of for instance R2 is meant to include all the possible isomeric forms of the heterocycles, for instance, pyrrolyl also includes 2//-pyrroIyl.<br>
The hereinabove-mentioned heterocycles may be attached to the remainder of the molecule of formula (I) through any ring carbon or heteroatom as appropriate, if not otherwise specified. Thus, for example, when the 5- or 6-membered heterocycle is imidazolyl, it may be 1-imidazolyl, 2-imidazolyI, 4-irnidazolyl and the like.<br>
When any variable (eg. R6, R7 etc.) occurs more than one time in any constituent, each definition is independent.<br>
Lines drawn into ring systems from substituents indicate that the bond may be attached to any of the suitable ring atoms of the ring system. For instance for a radical of formula (a-1), said radical may be attached to the remainder of the compound of formula (I) via a carbon atom of the phenyl moiety or via a carbon atom or heteroatom of the -B-C- moiety.<br>
For therapeutic use, salts of the compounds of formula (I) are those wherein the counterion is pharmaceutically acceptable. However, salts of acids and bases which are non-pharmaceutically acceptable may also find use, for example, in the preparation or purification of a pharmaceutically acceptable compound. All salts, whether<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable or not are included within the ambit of the present invention.<br>
The pharmaceutically acceptable addition salts as mentioned hereinabove are meant to comprise the therapeutically active non-toxic acid addition salt forms which the compounds of formula (I) are able to form. The latter can conveniently be obtained by treating the base form with such appropriate acids as inorganic acids, for example, hydrohalic acids, e.g. hydrochloric, hydrobromic and the like; sulfuric acid; nitric acid; phosphoric acid and the like; or organic acids, for example, acetic, propanoic, hydroxy-acetic, 2-hydroxypropanoic, 2-oxopropanoic, oxalic, malonic, succinic, maleic, fumaric, malic, tartaric, 2-hydroxy-l,2,3-propanetricarboxylic, methanesulfonic, ethanesulfonic, benzenesulfonic, 4-methylbenzenesulfonic, cyclohexanesulfamic, 2-hydroxybenzoic, 4-amino-2-hydroxybenzoic and the like acids. Conversely the salt form can be converted by treatment with alkali into the free base form.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) containing acidic protons may be converted into their therapeutically active non-toxic metal or amine addition salt forms by treatment with appropriate organic and inorganic bases. Appropriate base salt forms comprise, for example, the ammonium salts, the alkali and earth alkaline metal salts, e.g. the lithium, sodium, potassium, magnesium, calcium salts and the like, salts with organic bases, e.g. primary, secondary and tertiary aliphatic and aromatic amines such as methylamine, ethylamine, propylamine, isopropylamine, the fourbutylamine isomers, dimethylamine, diethylamine, diethanolamine, dipropylamine, diisopropylamine, di-n-butylamine, pyrrolidine, piperidine, morpholine, trimethylamine, triethylamine, tripropylamine, quinuclidine, pyridine, quinoline and isoquinoline, the benzathine, W-methyl-D-glucamine, 2-amino-2-(hydroxymethyl)-l,3-propanediol,hydrabamine salts, and salts with amino acids such as, for example, arginine, lysine and the like. Conversely the salt form can be converted by treatment with acid into the free acid form.<br>
The term addition salt also comprises the hydrates and solvent addition forms which the compounds of formula (I) are able to form. Examples of such forms are e.g. hydrates, alcoholates and the like.<br>
The term "quaternary amine" as used hereinbefore defines the quaternary ammonium salts which the compounds of formula (I) are able to form by reaction between a basic nitrogen of a compound of formula (I) and an appropriate quaternizing agent, such as, for example, an optionally substituted alkylhalide, arylhalide or arylalkylhalide, e.g.<br>

The compounds of formula (I) inhibit Glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3), in particular glycogen synthase kinase 3 alpha (GSK3a) and/or glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3J3). They are selective Glycogen synthase kinase 3 inhibitors. Specific inhibitory compounds are superior therapeutic agents since they are characterized by a greater efficacy and lower toxicity by virtue of their specificity.<br>
Synonyms for GSK3 are tau protein kinase I (TPK I), FA (Factor A) kinase, kinase FA and ATP-citrate lysase kinase (ACLK).<br>
Glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3), which exists in two isoforms as already stated above, i.e. GSK3oc and GSKSfi, is a proline-directed serine/threonine kinase originally identified as an enzyme that phosphorylates glycogen synthase. However, it has been demonstrated that GSK3 phosphorylates numerous proteins in vitro such as glycogen synthase, phosphatase inhibitor 1-2, the type-II subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase, the G-subunit of phosphatase-1, ATP-citrate lyase, acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase, myelin basic protein, a microtubule-associated protein, a neurofilament protein, an N-CAM cell adhesion molecule, nerve growth factor receptor, c-Jun transcription factor, JunD transcription factor, c-Myb transcription factor,<br><br>
c-Myc transcription factor, L-Myc transcription factor, adenomatous polyposis coli tumor supressor protein, tau protein and fi-catenin.<br>
The above-indicated diversity of proteins which may be phosphorylated by GSK3 implies that GSK3 is implicated in numerous metabolic and regulatory processes in cells.<br>
GSK3 inhibitors may therefore be useful in the prevention or treatment of diseases mediated through GSK3 activity such as bipolar disorder (in particular manic depression), diabetes, Alzheimer's disease, leukopenia, FTDP-17 (Pronto-temporal dementia associated with Parkinson's disease), cortico-basal degeneration, progressive supranuclear palsy, multiple system atrophy, Pick's disease, Niemann Pick's disease type C, Dementia Pugilistica, dementia with tangles only, dementia with tangles and calcification, Downs syndrome, myotonic dystrophy, Parkinsonism-dementia complex of Guam, aids related dementia, Postencephalic Parkinsoriism, prion diseases with tangles, subacute sclerosing panencephalitis, frontal lobe degeneration (FLD), argyrophilic grains disease, subacute sclerotizing panencephalitis (SSPE) (late complication of viral infections in the central nervous system), inflammatory diseases, depression, cancer, dermatological disorders such as baldness, neuroprotection, schizophrenia, pain, in particular neuropathic pain. GSK3 inhibitors can also be used to inhibit sperm motility and can therefore be used as male contraceptives. In particular, the compounds of the present invention are useful in the prevention or treatment of Alzheimer's disease; diabetes, in particular type 2 diabetes (non insulin dependent diabetes); bipolar disorder; cancer; pain, in particular neuropathic pain; depression; inflammatory diseases. More in particular, the compounds of the present invention are useful in the prevention or treatment of diabetes, in particular type 2 diabetes (non insulin dependent diabetes); pain, in particular neuropathic pain; depression; inflammatory diseases.<br>
The major neuropathological landmarks in Alzheimer's disease are neuronal loss, tlje deposition of amyloid fibers and paired helical filaments (PHF) or neurofibrillary tangles (NFT). Tangle formation appears to be the consequence of accumulation of aberrantly phosphorylated tau protein. This aberrant phosphorylation destabilizes neuronal cytoskeleton, which leads to reduced axonal transport, deficient functioning and ultimately neuronal death. The density of neurofibrillary tangles has been shown to parallel duration and severity of Alzheimer's disease. Reduction of the degree of tau phosphorylation can provide for neuroprotection and can prevent or treat Alzheimer's disease or can slow the progression of the disease. As mentioned hereinabove, GSK3<br><br>
phosphorylates tau protein. Thus compounds having an inhibitory activity for GSK3 may be useful for the prevention or the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.<br>
Insulin regulates the synthesis of the storage polysaccharide glycogen. The rate-limiting step in the glycogen synthesis is catalyzed by the enzyme glycogen synthase. It is believed that glycogen synthase is inhibited by phosphorylation and that insulin stimulates glycogen synthase by causing a net decrease in the phosphorylation of this enzyme. Thus, in order to activate glycogen synthase, insulin must either activate phosphatases or inhibit kinases, or both.<br>
It is believed that glycogen synthase is a substrate for glycogen synthase kinase 3 and that insulin inactivates GSK3 thereby promoting the dephosphorylation of glycogen synthase.<br>
In addition to the role of GSK3 in insulin-induced glycogen synthesis, GSK3 may also play a role in insulin resistance. It is believed that GSK3 dependent Insulin Receptor Substrate-1 phosphorylation contributes to insulin resistance. Therefore, GSK3 inhibition may result in the increased deposition of glycogen and a concomitant reduction of blood glucose, thus mimicing the hypoglycemic effect of insulin. GSK3 inhibition provides an alternative therapy to manage insulin resistance commonly observed in non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus and obesity. GSK3 inhibitors may thus provide a novel modality for the treatment of type 1 and type 2 diabetes.<br>
GSK3 inhibitors may also be indicated for use in the prevention or the treatment of<br>
pain, in particular neuropathic pain.<br>
After axotomy or chronic constriction injury, neuronal cells die through an apoptotic<br>
pathway and the morphological changes correlate with the onset of hyperalgesia and/or<br>
allodynia.<br>
The induction of apoptosis is probably triggered by a reduced supply of neurotrophic<br>
factors as the time course of neuronal loss is positively altered by administration of<br>
neurotrophins. GSK has been shown to be involved in the initiation of the apoptotic<br>
cascade and trophic factor withdrawal stimulates the GSK3 apoptosis pathway.<br>
In view of the above, GSK3 inhibitors might reduce signals of and even prevent levels<br>
of neuropathic pain.<br>
Due to their GSK3 inhibitory properties, the compounds of formula (I), their //-oxides, pharmaceutically acceptable addition salts, quaternary amines and stereochemically isomeric forms thereof, are useful to prevent or treat GSK3 mediated diseases, such as<br>

The present compounds are also useful as male contraceptives. In general, the compounds of the present invention may be useful in the treatment of warm-blooded animals suffering from a disease mediated through GSK3, or they may be useful to prevent warm-blooded animals to suffer from disease mediated through GSK3. More in particular, the compounds of the present invention may be useful in the treatment of warm-blooded animals suffering from Alzheimer's disease; diabetes, in particular type 2 diabetes; cancer; inflammatory diseases; bipolar disorder, depression; pain, in particular neuropathic pain. Even more in particular, the compounds of the present invention may be useful in the treatment of warm-blooded animals suffering from diabetes, in particular type 2 diabetes; inflammatory diseases; depression; pain, in particular neuropathic pain.<br>

preventing warm-blooded animals, including humans, to suffer from diseases mediated through GSK3, more in particular a method of treating or preventing Alzheimer's disease; diabetes, in particular type 2 diabetes; cancer; inflammatory diseases; bipolar disorder; depression; pain, in particular neuropathic pain, even more in particular diabetes, in particular type 2 diabetes; inflammatory diseases; depression; pain, in particular neuropathic pain. Said method comprises the administration, preferably oral administration, of an effective amount of a compound of formula (I), a AT-oxide form, a pharmaceutically acceptable addition salt, a quaternary amine or a possible stereoisomeric form thereof, to warm-blooded animals, including humans.<br>
The present invention also provides compositions for preventing or treating diseases mediated through GSK3, comprising a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of formula (I), aJV-oxide, a pharmaceutically acceptable addition salt, a quaternary amine and a stereochemically isomeric form thereof, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent.<br>
The compounds of the present invention or any subgroup thereof may be formulated into various pharmaceutical forms for administration purposes. As appropriate compositions there may be cited all compositions usually employed for systemically administering drugs. To prepare the pharmaceutical compositions of this invention, an effective amount of the particular compound, optionally in addition salt form, as the active ingredient is combined in intimate admixture with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, which carrier may take a wide variety of forms depending on the form of preparation desired for administration. These pharmaceutical compositions are desirable in unitary dosage form suitable, particularly, for administration orally, rectally, percutaneously, or by parenteral injection. For example, in preparing the compositions in oral dosage form, any of the usual pharmaceutical media may be employed such as, for example, water, glycols, oils, alcohols and the like in the case of oral liquid preparations such as suspensions, syrups, elixirs, emulsions and solutions; or solid carriers such as starches, sugars, kaolin, diluents, lubricants, binders, disintegrating agents and the like in the case of powders, pills, capsules, and tablets. Because of their ease in administration, tablets and capsules represent the most advantageous oral dosage unit forms, in which case solid pharmaceutical carriers are obviously employed. For parenteral compositions, the carrier will usually comprise sterile water, at least in large part, though other ingredients, for example, to aid solubility, may be included. Injectable solutions, for example, may be prepared in which the carrier comprises saline solution, glucose solution or a mixture of saline and<br>
glucose solution. Injectable suspensions may also be prepared in which case appropriate liquid carriers, suspending agents and the like may be employed. Also included are solid form preparations which are intended to be converted, shortly before use, to liquid form preparations. In the compositions suitable for percutaneous administration, the carrier optionally comprises a penetration enhancing agent and/or a suitable wetting agent, optionally combined with suitable additives of any nature in minor proportions, which additives do not introduce a significant deleterious effect on the skin. Said additives may facilitate the administration to the skin and/or may be helpful for preparing the desired compositions. These compositions may be administered in various ways, e.g., as a transdermal patch, as a spot-on, as an ointment. The compounds of the present invention may also be administered via inhalation or insufflation by means of methods and formulations employed in the art for administration via this way. Thus, in general the compounds of the present invention may be administered to the lungs in the form of a solution, a suspension or a dry powder. Any system developed for the deli very of solutions, suspensions or dry powders via oral or nasal inhalation or insufflation are suitable for the administration of the present compounds.<br>
It is especially advantageous to formulate the aforementioned pharmaceutical compositions in unit dosage form for ease of administration and uniformity of dosage. Unit dosage form as used herein refers to physically discrete units suitable as unitary dosages, each unit containing a predetermined quantity of active ingredient calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect in association with the required pharmaceutical carrier. Examples of such unit dosage forms are tablets (including scored or coated tablets), capsules, pills, powder packets, wafers, suppositories, injectable solutions or suspensions and the like, and segregated multiples thereof.<br>

D. Pharmacological Example<br>
The pharmacological activity of the present compounds was examined using the<br>
following test.<br>
GSKSbeta assays were performed at room temperature in a 100 /il reaction volume of 25mM Tns (pH 7.4) containing 10 mM MgCl2.6H2O( 1 mM DTT, 0.1 mg/ml BSA, 5% glycerol and containing 5.7 ng/jUl GSK3|3, 5 [iM biotinylated phosphorylated CREB<br>
peptide , 1 pM ATP, 0.85/iCi/ml ATP-P33 and a suitable amount of a test compound of formula (I). After one hour, the reaction was terminated by adding 70 jul of Stop mix (0.1 mM ATP, 5 mg/ml streptavidin coated PVT SPA bead pH 11.0). The beads to which the phosphorylated CREB peptide is attached were allowed to settle overnight and the radioactivity of the beads was counted in a microtiterplate scintillation counter and compared with the results obtained in a control experiment (without the presence of a test compound) in order to determine the percentage of GSK3J3 inhibition. The value, i.e. the concentration (M) of the test compound at which 50 % of GSK3(3 is inhibited, was calculated from the dose response curve obtained by performing the above-described GSK3J3 assay in the presence of different amounts of the test compound.<br>
The GSKSalpha assay was performed in the same way as described above for the GSKSbeta assay except for the concentration of GSKSalpha which is 0.25 ng/ul.<br>
