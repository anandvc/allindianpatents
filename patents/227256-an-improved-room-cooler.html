				<td>This' invention relates to humidity, temperature and breeding of mosquitoes control room cooler.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
The room coolers available in the market have a metal/plastic rectangular frame having openings at three sides and fan fixed on the fourth side. The said fourth side may have louvers before it to change the direction of the air-flow. The three open sides are covered with frames having cooling pads. The said frames are removable. In these coolers the air is sucked from three sides by the suction fan ad the water flow is continuously sprinkled on the said three cooling pads. When the air is sucked from three sides it gets cooled and wet and is thrown from the front fourth side to make the room cool.<br>
The drawbacks of these cooler;, are.<br>
•	There is no humidity control<br>
•	There is no temperature control<br>
The water droplets come out from the front side, which makes the room or articles lying in the room wet<br>
•	The water tank at the base of the body of the cooler is open,<br>
causing mosquitoes to breed and thereby causing diseases.<br>
The object of this invention is to control the humidity and temperature of the air, which is sucked and is thrown into the room and also preventing breeding of mosquitoes.<br>
To achieve the said objective this invention provides a humidity, temperature and breeding of mosquitoes control room cooler comprising:<br>
a casing having any two opposite sides open,<br>
an exhaust fan fixed in front of one open side and the other<br>
opposite side has suction windows,<br><br>
slots are provided in one side of said casing,<br>
a number of cooling pads are arranged in said slots between said<br>
exhaust fan and said suctions windows,<br>
a water spraying system on said cooling pads with control release<br>
of water for each said pad, and<br>
a water tank with pump is provided at the bottom of said casing.<br>
The said cooling pads are arranged parallel to each other.<br>
Louvers are provided on said one open side for changing the direction of cooled air-flow from said cooler.<br>
The said water spraying system consists of a pump for pumping water from the water tank to the water spraying means having control valves for water spra\. said water spray control system is provided under the roof of said casing over said cool ing pads.<br>
The water released from the spraying system on said cooling pads is controlled by water flow valves for each pad so that the cooling pad before said suction window receives maximum amount of water and the cooling pad before said exhaust fan receives waterjust to moist.<br>
The said tank at the base of said casing is covered with a metal sheet slanting towards said suction window end to prevent suction of water from a cooling pad before the suction fan. This slanting metal sheet also prevents mosquitoes to breed in and help not to spread diseases.<br>
The said metal sheet is provided with water collection hole covered with a net towards said suction window.<br><br>
The number of cooling pads can be increased or decreased depending upon the cooling temperature required in the room.<br>
The frames for holding the cooling pads is provided with hooks to prevent the cooling pads from shrinking<br>
Casing of said frame is made of metal or plastic.<br>
The number of blades of said exhaust fan can be increased subject to desired cooling.<br>
The invention will  now be described with reference io the accompanying<br>
drawings<br>
Figure 1 shows the back perspective view of the room coolers, according to this invention.<br>
Figure 2 shows the front perspective view of the room cooler, according to this invention.<br>
Figure 3 shows the water spraying system according to this invention Figure 4 shows the water tank, according to this invention.<br>
Figure 5 shows the frame for holding the cooling pads,  according to this invention.<br><br>
Referring to the drawings, item (1) shows the casing having openings on opposite sides (Ol, O2). On '()!' side an exhaust fan is fixed and on O2 side<br>
windows (4) are provided. On side S the slots SI, S2, S3, S4, S5 	 are<br>
provided for holding the frame "F', (shown in figure 5) having the cooling pad (P). The said cooling pad frame is fitted airtight in said slots. The water spray<br>
system is fitted under the roof of said cooler with valves (VI, V2, V3, V4	).<br>
The construction of said valves is such that the water flow from the system is maximum on the pad closer to said suction windows (4) and goes on decreasing till the pad before the exhaust fan (BF) is just moist. The water tank (2), which is at the base of the casing (1) is closed at its top having a hole towards the suction window side of the casing (1). The said tank contains a pump for pumping water lo the water spraying system. The hole (7) is provided in said water sheet to collect water, which falls from said cooling pads and back io the water tank (2). The frame (F) for holding the cooling pads (P) is shown in figure 5. These frames along with the cooling pads are fitted airtight in said slots (SI.<br>
S2, S3, S4	) in said side (S) of casing (1). The hole (7) is provided with a net<br>
(N).<br>
WORKING<br>
The air from the said suction windows is sucked by the exhaust fan and it passes through the cooling pads which are wet in varying degree and said sucked air loses heat on said cooling pads and finally reaches the moist pad and loses its moisture. The air which is blown out of the said cooler is comparatively humidity and temperature controlled. The temperature of the room is controlled by the number of cooling pads provided in the cooler.<br><br><br><br>
Claim :<br>
1.	An improved room cooler comprising:<br>
a casing (1), an exhaust fan (EF) and water tank (2) with a pump at the bottom of said casing characterized in that<br>

-	slots (S1,S2,S3,S4,S5...) being provided in one side of said casing,<br>
-	a number of cooling pads (P) are arranged in said slots between said exhaust fan (EF) and said suction windows (4) and<br>
-	a water spraying system on said cooling pads (P) with control release of water for each said pad.<br><br>
2.	An improved room cooler as claimed in claim 1 wherein said cooling pads (P) are placed parallel to each other.<br>
3.	An improved room cooler as claimed in claim 1, wherein louvers are positioned on one open side for changing the direction of cooled air flow.<br>
