				<td>Electrolytic cell comprising an interior trough<br>
[0001]	The invention relates to an electrolytic device for halogen gas production<br>
from aqueous alkali halide solution in several plate-type electrolytic cells stacked and<br>
arranged side-by-side and provided with electrical contacts, each of the cells provided<br>
with a housing consisting of two half-shells made of electrically conductive material and<br>
having external contact strips on at least one housing rear wall, said housing being<br>
equipped with devices for feeding electrolytic current and electrolysis reactants and for<br>
discharging electrolytic current and products, with anodic and cathodic electrodes that<br>
evolve gas during normal operation and with gas outlets.<br>
[0002]	Electrolytic cells are well known and a typical example of state-of-the-art<br>
technology is described in DE 196 41 125 A1. A device of this type ensures adequate<br>
gas separation in the upper rear zone by means of a guide plate arranged towards the<br>
membrane and which is in addition used for sufficiently wetting the electrolytic<br>
membrane during the electrolyser operation. However, difficulties in maintaining such a<br>
wetting may arise from interruptions of the electrolyser operation.<br>
[0003]	In order to protect the standard coatings it is possible to polarise the cell<br>
during downtime periods such as start-up, shut-down, service interruptions or failures.<br>
This applies whenever the cell must be filled and heated prior to starting operation.<br>
When shutting down the electrolyser it is likewise imperative that the polarisation be<br>
maintained until the anodic liquid is purged from chlorine and cooled down.<br>
[0004]	In case the electrolyser membrane is not sufficiently flooded in the upper<br>
cell zone, the single element technology as described in DE 195 41 125 A1 provides<br>
for a liquid level adjustment in the half-shells via the overfall weir of the standpipe. The<br>
polarisation current must not be selected arbitrarily but has to exceed a given<br>
threshold.<br>
[0005]	Depending on the type of material used for the standpipe, such as metal or<br>
PTFE, and on its chamfered angle, gas zones more than 20 mm high may be<br><br>
WO2004/040040								PCT/DE2003/003431<br>
2<br>
established in the upper part of the cell in the cold state. Investigations revealed that<br>
the membrane installed in the electrolytic cell is not gas-tight but presents a diffusion<br>
rate that depends on the molecular size, irrespective of the differential pressure<br>
between the anodic and cathodic chambers. As hydrogen gas is generated at the<br>
cathode and chlorine or oxygen gas are generated at the anode depending on the<br>
current density, hydrogen gas diffuses in the anodic chamber on account of its<br>
substantially smaller atomic size. The amount of the anodic gas build-up when the<br>
polarisation is switched on must be such that the explosion limit of the<br>
chlorine/hydrogen mixture or oxygen/hydrogen mixture is assuredly not reached. The<br>
production rate of oxygen or chlorine gas to be set is directly proportional to the<br>
polarisation current and also depends on the membrane surface area in the gas<br>
chamber. An electrolyser as described in DE196 41 125 A1 requires a polarisation<br>
current of approx. 28 A, said device having PTFE standpipes and a gas chamber 20<br>
mm high in the warm state and up to 30 mm high in the cold state of the electrolyser.<br>
[0006]	The object of the invention, therefore, is to design a device that overcomes<br>
the aforementioned difficulties and that requires lower polarisation currents.<br>
[0007]	The object of the invension is achieved by providing built-in components to<br>
be installed in the electrolyser in such a manner that the liquid level is raised so as to<br>
minimise the volume of the remaining gas zone and to reduce the minimum current<br>
required for polarisation. This method permits the filling of the cell element over the top<br>
edge of the membrane so that the minimum current required for polarisation with the<br>
element filled, hence in the absence of a hydrogen gas chamber contacting the<br>
electrolytic membrane, is achieved even by currentless polarisation.<br>
[0008]	The invention provides for built-in components to be installed in the<br>
appropriate electrolytic chamber and suited for playing a role in the hydraulics and<br>
dynamics of the liquid/gas mixture. Said built-in components are characterised in that<br>
•	they form an internal trough located in parallel to the electrolytic membrane and<br>
	arranged horizontally,<br>
•	an interspace is provided between the trough and the electrolytic membrane,<br>
•	an interspace is also formed between said trough and the upper side of the<br>
	electrolytic chamber, a part of which is located above the membrane,<br><br>
WO2004/040040								PCT/DE2003/003431<br>
3<br>
•	said trough has at least one opening communicating with the interspace between<br>
	the trough and the upper side of the electrolytic chamber,<br>
•	said trough has at least one outlet.<br>
lt is possible to provide the internal trough either on the anodic or cathodic side or on<br>
both the anodic and cathodic sides and it serves as an overfall weir for liquid or gas.<br>
Moreover, it may be arranged along the whole cell width, merely in the inlet and outlet<br>
sections or ir any other section therebetween.<br>
[0009]	In a particular embodiment of the invention, the interspace between the<br>
trough and the upper side of the electrolytic chamber is implemented as a gap.<br>
preferably of 2 to 3 mm width. In a particularly preferred embodiment such gap is<br>
inclined both outwards and upwards with respect to the horizontal plane as seen from<br>
the electrolytic membrane. The gap may also have a variable width, the adjacent<br>
interfaces being straight, corrugated or arched.<br>
[0010]	In a further embodiment of the invention, the interspace between the trough<br>
and the upper side of the electrolytic chamber is equipped with a perforated plate<br>
arranged parallel to the electrolytic membrane or slightly inclined therefrom so that the<br>
holes have the function of a perforated diaphragm.<br>
[0011]	According to a further embodiment of the invention, the interspace<br>
between the trough and the upper part of the electronic chamber is equipped with a<br>
duct bundle, the axes of the ducts lying in the plane of the interspace. The ducts need<br>
not be circular but may also be honeycomb-structured. The greater stiffness of this<br>
structure constitutes a particular advantage.<br>
[0012]	A further embodiment of the invention provides for beads, webs, nipples or<br>
other spacers to be installed in the interspace between the trough and the upper part of<br>
the electrolytic chamber, said spacers being used to geometrically delimit said<br>
interspace and to secure the implementation of the defined flow pattern.<br><br>
WO2004/040040							PCT/DE2003/003431<br>
4<br>
[0013]	According to a further embodiment of the invention, the members which<br>
form the trough, inlets, outlets and related supports are at least partly coated to ensure<br>
corrosion protection.<br>
[0014]	A further advantage of the invention is that the lower part of the trough also<br>
assumes the function of gas pre-sepa ration which calms down the flow and dampens<br>
or even prevents pulsation.<br>
[0015]	A leak of the trough will not necessarily jeopardise the operation of the<br>
electrolytic cell since the cell built-in components are sealed inside the cell, which<br>
represents a further advantage.<br>
[0016]	The device according to the invention can be retrofitted as an assembly into<br>
existing plants, which is a further advantage.<br>
[0017]	The device designed in accordance with the invention, moreover, has a<br>
particular advantage in that the anodic and cathodic rear walls need not specific<br>
geometric requirements, hence they may be straight, corrugated or inclined.<br>
[0018]	In the following, the invention will be illustrated by means of an example.<br>
Fig. 1 shows a cross-sectional view of the upper part of an electrolytic cell provided<br>
with the troughs described in this invention and arranged on the anodic and cathodic<br>
sides.<br>
[0019]	The two half-shells of the electrolytic cell are formed by anode rear wall 1<br>
and cathode rear wall 2 and firmly damped by means of bolted connection 3. The<br>
anodic electrode 4 of liouver-type design and the cathodic efectrode 5 are arranged<br>
approximately in the centre of the electrolyser by means of support and fixing elements<br>
not shewn in the Figure, the electrolytic membrane 6 being located between electrodes<br>
4 and 5.<br>
[0020]	The anode side shows the trough 7 designed as a folded sheet 8. The<br>
chlorine gas that forms at the louver-type anodic electrode 4 and the electrolytic liquid<br>
simultaneously enter as a foam the interspace 9 located between sheet 8 dellmiting<br>
trough 7 and electrode 4. The major part of the foam babbles collapses underneath<br>
trough 7 so that they enter pre-separated into trough 7 via interspace 9 and gap 10.<br><br>
WO2004/040040								PCT/DE2003/003431<br>
5<br>
[0021]	In the event of a shutdown, the amount of Iiquid admitted to the cell is such<br>
that its level reaches the upper end 11 of gap 10. This method permits to completely<br>
wet membrane 6 on the anode side, which reduces the quantity of hydrogen diffusing<br>
from the cathode to anode side.<br>
[0022]	The cathode side shows trough 12 designed as bent sheet 13. The<br>
hydrogen gas formed at the flat cathodic electrode 5 and the electrolytic liquid<br>
simultaneously enter the interspace 14 located between sheet 13 delimiting trough 12<br>
and electrode 5 as foam bubbles. The major part of the foam bubbles burst underneath<br>
trough 12 so that they are pre-separated and enter trough 12 via interspace 14 and gap<br>
15.<br>
[0023]	In the event of a shutdown, the amount of liquid admitted to the cell is such<br>
that its level reaches upper end 16 of gap 15. This method permits wetting of the<br>
complete membrane 6 on the cathodic side, which prevents hydrogen diffusion from<br>
the cathodic to the anodic side.<br><br>
