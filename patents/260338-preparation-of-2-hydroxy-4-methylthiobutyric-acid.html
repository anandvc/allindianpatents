Preparation of 2-hydroxy-4-methylthiobutyric acid<br>
The present invention relates to a process for the<br>
preparation of 2-hydroxy-4-methylthiobutyric acid, which<br>
describes the use of specific materials for the various<br>
process stages.<br>
Prior art<br>
Nutritivity-improving feedstuffs additives are nowadays an<br>
indispensable constituent of animal nutrition. They serve<br>
for better utilization of the food supply, stimulate growth<br>
and promote the formation of protein. One of the most<br>
important of these additives is the essential amino acid<br>
methionine, which occupies a prominent position as a<br>
feedstuffs additive above all in poultry rearing. However,<br>
so-called methionine substitutes, such as methionine<br>
hydroxy analogue (abbreviated to MHA) also have a not<br>
inconsiderable importance in this field, since they have<br>
similar growth-stimulating properties to the amino acid<br>
known for this.<br>
The racemic form of 2-hydroxy-4-methylthiobutyric acid is a<br>
methionine substitute which has been known for a long time<br>
and is chiefly used as a feedstuffs additive in animal<br>
nutrition, in particular in the rearing of poultry. This<br>
MHA can be used instead of methionine and, like this,<br>
improves the yield of breast meat on poultry. It is<br>
furthermore also used pharmaceutically in the form of its<br>
calcium salt in the treatment of renal insufficiency.<br>
MHA is usually employed in the form of aqueous<br>
concentrates, these also comprising, in addition to the<br>
monomer, a certain content of oligomers, chiefly the di-<br>
and trimeric linear ester acids. The content of these<br>
oligomers depends on the preparation conditions and the<br>
concentration chosen.<br><br>
It is generally known that 2-hydroxy-4-methylthiobutyric<br>
acid can be prepared continuously or batchwise by hydration<br>
and successive hydrolysis of 2-hydroxy-4-<br>
methylthiobutyronitrile in a sulfuric acid medium.<br>
The synthesis is carried out, for example, in accordance<br>
with EP-A-0 874 811, but not exclusively, as follows:<br>
The general process for the preparation of MHA starts from<br>
3-methylthiopropionaldehyde, also called<br>
methylmercaptopropionaldehyde or MMP, which is reacted with<br>
hydrogen cyanide to give 2-hydroxy-4-<br>
methylthiobutyronitrile, also called MMP-cyanohydrin or<br>
MMP-CH (Equation I)<br><br>
The MMP-cyanohydrin formed is then conventionally<br>
hydrolysed with strong mineral acids, such as sulfuric acid<br>
or hydrochloric acid, via the intermediate stage of 2-<br>
hydroxy-4-methylthiobutyramide, also called MHA-amide<br>
(Equation II)<br><br>
to give methionine hydroxy analogue (MHA) (Equation III).<br><br><br>
This hydrolysis can be carried out in either one or two<br>
stages, "stages" being understood as meaning that mineral<br>
acids and/or water are added either once or twice for<br>
hydrolysis of the MMP-CH.<br>
Thus, for example, the hydrolysis of MMP-CH is carried out<br>
by a procedure in which the MMP-CH is hydrolysed in a first<br>
stage with 60-85 wt.% strength, preferably with 65-80 wt.%<br>
strength sulfuric acid in the molar ratio of MMP-CH to<br>
H2SO4 of 1.0:0.5 to 1:1.0, preferably 1:0.6 to 1:0.95, at<br>
temperatures of 30-90 °C, preferably 50-70 °C, for the<br>
preparation of MHA-amide. MHA-amide is formed from the MMP-<br>
cyanohydrin by this procedure, the mixture formed<br>
furthermore being substantially free from unreacted MMP-<br>
cyanohydrin. The hydrolysis proceeds virtually<br>
quantitatively. In a second stage, the MHA-amide is<br>
hydrolysed with the addition of water, without further<br>
addition of H2SO4 (a sulfuric acid concentration of 
for example, is established), at temperatures up to 140 °C,<br>
preferably 
Further processes which as a rule differ only in the<br>
downstream process are moreover described. Thus, the<br>
specification JP-B-7-97970 describes the extraction of MHA<br>
from the reaction mixture with methyl isobutyl ketone.<br>
EP-A-863 135 describes another process with the addition of<br>
ammonium bisulfate to the hydrolysis solution. After the<br>
reaction, an organic solvent which is not miscible with<br>
water is added, with the result that MHA becomes<br>
concentrated in the organic phase. It is furthermore<br>
disclosed that a water-miscible organic solvent can be<br>
added to the aqueous phase in order to precipitate the<br>
corresponding ammonium sulfate.<br>
Further processes for obtaining MHA without the use of an<br>
organic extraction solvent are described, for example, in<br>
US 4,912,257 or EP-A-1 149 073. Various media of complex<br>
composition with various pH values and corresponding<br><br>
corrosiveness are present in all of these processes. This<br>
corrosiveness has the effect that considerable investment<br>
is necessary annually for maintenance as a result of<br>
incorrect choice of materials in the abovementioned<br>
process.<br>
The apparatuses and pipelines required for production<br>
processes in corrosive complex media are conventionally<br>
manufactured from enamelled components, which are<br>
demonstrably distinguished by a high resistance to<br>
corrosion by acidic media. Enamelled components have the<br>
disadvantage that they are very sensitive to mechanical<br>
stresses such as occur in particular during assembly or the<br>
daily production operation. Once the enamelled surface has<br>
been damaged, corrosion can no longer be stopped, since the<br>
carrier material as a rule is standard steel, which is<br>
known to be not very resistant to acidic media.<br>
A further disadvantage of enamelled components is that they<br>
must be prefabricated in a protracted manner in separate<br>
production plants and often are not available in the<br>
desired dimensions. Under certain circumstances, this can<br>
lead to long standstills of installations and resulting<br>
economic losses. Because of the poor heat transfer<br>
coefficients of enamelled components, for example,<br>
corresponding heat exchangers of large volume must be<br>
manufactured. This is likewise reflected in higher<br>
investment costs.<br>
A further disadvantage of enamelled components is the high<br>
number of flange connections required, resulting from the<br>
limited manufacturing possibilities, which, as potential<br>
possibilities of leakage, necessitate increased expenditure<br>
on environmental protection measures. A further<br>
disadvantage of the material enamel is to be seen in the<br>
fact that because of manufacturing obstacles, the<br>
constructional degrees of freedom in the manufacture of<br><br>
specific resources-preserving apparatuses are severely<br>
limited.<br>
The Patent Application WO96/40630 indeed discloses, for<br>
example, for a continuous process for the preparation of 2-<br>
hydroxy-4-methylthiobutyric acid, that corrosion-resistant<br>
materials are to be considered for the reaction<br>
apparatuses, pumps and heat exchangers employed, but there<br>
is no information as to what these materials are.<br>
The Dechema Materials Table (1969, 1971) recommends<br>
austenitic steels for sulfuric acid media, but these are<br>
classified as non-resistant in the concentrations and<br>
temperatures required for the reaction. The stated material<br>
loss rates are not to be tolerated in respect of any<br>
resulting heavy metal impurities for the MHA end product<br>
which enters the food chain. The corrosion resistance of<br>
materials is generally determined e.g. by measurement of<br>
the material loss rates in mm p.a. as a measure of the<br>
corrosion which has taken place (definition in Rompp's<br>
Lexikon der Chemie, 1990, page 2344).<br>
In the present connection, materials having material loss<br>
rates of at least less than 0.06 mm p.a. at temperatures of<br>
It has also been reported in the Dechema Materials Table<br>
(1969) in the sulfuric acid section, sheet 17, that the<br>
corrosion resistance can be increased considerably by<br>
alloying with copper, but the material loss rates continue<br>
to be unsatisfactorily high. There is a so-called<br>
resistance gap between 31-82 % strength aqueous sulfuric<br>
acid and temperatures of &gt; 20 °C for NiCrMoCu alloys. The<br>
material loss rates are, for example, approx. 0.1 mm per<br>
annum (p.a.) at 80 °C and sulfuric acid concentrations of<br>
between 10 and 78 %.<br><br>
It is also known from H. Zitter, Werkstoffe und Korrosion 7<br>
(1957), 758 that steels having the composition of 18 % Cr,<br>
22 % Ni, 3 % Mo and 2 % copper have material loss rates of<br>
up to 1.8 mm p.a. in the concentration range of 60 to 80 %<br>
strength sulfuric acid at 60 °C. It is furthermore known<br>
from the Dechema Materials Table that nickel alloys are<br>
corrosion-resistant in sulfuric acid media. Thus, for<br>
example, a good resistance in the concentration range of 2-<br>
96 % at room temperature is stated for Hastelloy F (48 %<br>
Ni, 22 % Cr, 15 % Fe, 6.5 % Mo, 2 % NS+Ta). At temperatures<br>
of 66 or 80 °C, material loss rates of 
are not acceptable for the MHA process, are stated. It is<br>
furthermore reported that nickel/molybdenum/chromium alloys<br>
of the type (NiMol8Crl7W) withstand all sulfur<br>
concentrations at room temperature.<br>
At 70 °C and sulfuric acid concentrations of 
loss of material is still to be described as favourable. At<br>
higher concentrations, the peak material loss rates are up<br>
to 0.5-0.75 mm p. a. Thus, for example, according to<br>
Nickel-Informationsbiiro GmbH, Diisseldorf (1961, October),<br>
page 36, the material loss rate is 0.2 mm p.a. for the<br>
alloy Hastelloy C (54 % Ni, 16 % Mo, 16 % Cr, 4 % W, 4-6 %<br>
Fe, 0.05-0.07 % C) at 70 °C in 40 % strength sulfuric acid.<br>
Zirconium is to be regarded as the only material having<br>
acceptable corrosion rates which is suitable for the<br>
abovementioned reaction conditions, but this is prohibitive<br>
in many cases of use from the economic aspect. Standard<br>
steel having a Teflon coating or other possible materials<br>
have also been mentioned, but without being discussed in<br>
more detail. Example 22 of WO96/40630 describes the use of<br>
a flow pipe manufactured from standard steel and having a<br>
Teflon coating. Such composite construction materials have<br>
the same disadvantages as enamels, for example, but not<br>
exclusively, with respect to heat transfer coefficients<br>
and/or degrees of freedom during construction/manufacture.<br><br>
Object of the invention<br>
It is therefore the object of this invention to provide<br>
construction materials, for machines and apparatuses, which<br>
are suitable for the particular process stages of the<br>
process described above.<br>
Description of the invention<br>
Materials which as a rule do not have the abovementioned<br>
disadvantages have now been found for the preparation of 2-<br>
hydroxy-4-methylthiobutyric acid. That is to say,<br>
superfluous flange connections can be avoided thanks to<br>
joining techniques which can be used. This reduces the<br>
susceptibility to leakages to a high degree, and<br>
contributes toward an improved protection of the<br>
environment to a large degree. Mechanical stresses such as<br>
occur in general production operation and during assembly<br>
lead to no damage which influences the corrosion<br>
properties. No limits are imposed on constructional<br>
optimization of reaction apparatuses. Thanks to the low<br>
heat transfer resistances, heat exchangers, for example,<br>
can be manufactured with a low resources-preserving<br>
construction volume.<br>
One aspect of this invention is a process for the<br>
preparation of 2-hydroxy-4-methylthiobutyric acid, in which<br>
the addition product 2-hydroxy-4-methylthiobutyronitrile<br>
obtained by addition of hydrocyanic acid on to 3-<br>
methylpropionaldehyde is reacted with sulfuric acid via the<br>
intermediate 2-hydroxy-4-methylthiobutyramide,<br>
characterized in that the reaction of 2-hydroxy-4-<br>
methylthiobutyronitrile to give 2-hydroxy-4-<br>
methylthiobutyramide and the subsequent conversion to 2-<br>
hydroxy-4-methylthiobutyric acid are carried out in<br>
reaction containers which are corrosion-resistant for the<br>
reaction media employed and are manufactured from alloyed<br>
steel or corresponding nickel alloys.<br><br>
A further aspect of the invention is a process for the<br>
preparation of 2-hydroxy-4-methylthiobutyric acid in which<br>
the addition product 2-hydroxy-4-methylthiobutyronitrile<br>
obtained by addition of hydrocyanic acid on to 3-<br>
methylpropionaldehyde is reacted with sulfuric acid via the<br>
intermediate 2-hydroxy-4-methylthiobutyramide,<br>
characterized in that the process is carried out in<br>
reaction containers of alloyed steel or corresponding<br>
nickel alloys which have a material loss rate of 

preferably 
 p.a. at temperatures of ^ 110 °C.<br><br>
 In contrast to the literature described above, it has been found, surprisingly, that alloys of the type, for example,<br>
XNiMoCu or NiMoCrW can be employed under the abovementioned<br>
process conditions. It has been found, surprisingly, that<br>
alloys of the type XxNiMoCu, such as e.g. XiNiCrMoCu 32287<br>
(1.4562), and NiMoCrW, such as e.g. NiCr31Mol4W (2.4602) or<br>
NiMol6Crl5W (Hastelloy C-246), have acceptable material<br>
 loss rates under the conditions which prevail in the MHA process. Nevertheless, alloys of the type XxNiMoCuN, for<br>
example of the type XiNiMoCuN 25205 (1.4539) or XiNiCrMoCu<br>
81274 (1.4563), are not suitable. Furthermore,<br>
surprisingly, the material of the type NiCr23Mol6Al<br>
(2.4605) or NiCr22Mo9Nb (2.4856) has proved to be suitable.<br><br><br>
In detail, the following materials have been found for the<br>
corresponding process steps:<br>
For the process stage of conversion of 2-hydroxy-4-<br>
methylthiobutyronitrile to 2-hydroxy-4-<br>
methylthiobutyramide, the materials 2.4602, 2.4605, 2.4856<br>
and 1.4562 are suitable as construction materials for<br><br>
temperatures of 
pumps and pipelines.<br>
The alloys have been classified in accordance with DIN EN<br>
10027-2 of 1992.<br>
For the so-called hydrolysis stage of 2-hydroxy-4-<br>
methylthiobutyramide to 2-hydroxy-4-methylthiobutyric acid<br>
at temperatures of ^ 110 °C, only the material 2.4605 has<br>
been found to be suitable for the construction of the<br>
reactors and heat exchangers. Materials 2.4602 and 2.4605<br>
are suitable for the pipelines. It has been found that the<br>
materials 2.4819 (Hastelloy C-276) and 2.4605 are suitable<br>
as the construction material for pumps.<br>
The present invention is explained in more detail in the<br>
following with the aid of embodiment examples. These serve<br>
only to illustrate the invention and are in no way to be<br>
regarded as limiting in the nature and scope of this.<br>
Example 1<br>
The reaction container in which 2-hydroxy-4-<br>
methylthiobutyronitrile is converted into 2-hydroxy-4-<br>
methylthiobutyramide in the presence of 65-70 % strength<br>

Comparison example A<br>
The procedure was according to Example 4, but a sample of<br>
material of the type Enamel WWG911 (supplier: Pfaudler,<br>
Pfaudler Strasse D-68723 Schwetzingen) was employed. A<br>
material loss rate of 0.021 mm p.a. was determined.<br>
Comparison example B<br>
The procedure was according to Comparison Example A. An<br>
Enamel 3009 (supplier: DeDietrich, Niederbronn / France)<br>
was employed. The material loss rate was 0.033 mm p.a.<br>
Comparison example C<br>
Reaction conditions as in Example 1 were chosen, but a<br>
material of the type 1.453 9 was employed. The material loss<br>
rate was 0.069 mm p.a.<br>
Comparison Example D<br>
The procedure was according to Example 1, but a material of<br>
the type 1.4563 was employed. A material loss rate of<br>
0.06 mm p.a. was determined.<br><br>
Comparison Example E<br>
The procedure was according to Example 3, but a material of<br>
the type 1.4562 was exposed to the reaction conditions for<br>
250 hours. A material loss rate of 0.37 mm p.a. was<br>
determined.<br>
The abovementioned investigations were carried out in<br>
accordance with ASTM G4-68. In these, pickled coupons (60 x<br>
2 0 mm) of the material in question were used in the<br>
reaction medium. The pickling was carried out at room<br>
temperature for 1 to 2 hours. 24 vol% aqueous HF (40 %) ,<br>
8 vol% aqueous HN03 (65 %) in water was used as the<br>
pickling solution.<br>
After the test time had elapsed, the samples were washed<br>
successively with water and acetone and then dried to<br>
constant weight with a hot air fan.<br>
The weight loss caused by corrosion was then determined by<br>
weighing and comparison with the original weight of the<br>
coupon. The material loss rate in mm p.a. was calculated<br>
from the weight loss.<br>
A summary of all the materials investigated and their<br>
composition is given in Table 1. The results of Examples 1-<br>
5 and comparison Examples A-E are summarized in Table 2<br><br><br><br><br><br>

ABSTRACT<br><br><br>
Title: Preparation of 2-hydroxy-4-methylthiobutyric acid.<br>
A process for the preparation of 2-hydroxy-4-methylthiobutyric acid, comprising<br>
reacting an addition product 2-hydroxy-4-methylthiobutyronitrile obtained by<br>
addition of hydrocyanic acid on to 3-methyithiopropionaldehyde with sulfuric acid<br>
via an intermediate 2-hydroxy-4-methylthiobutyramide, wherein the reaction of 2-<br>
hydroxy-4-methylthiobutyronitrile to give 2-hydroxy-4-methylthiobutyramide and<br>
the subsequent conversion to 2-hydroxy-4-methylthiobutyric acid are carried out<br>
in reaction containers which are corrosion-resistant for reaction media employed<br>
and are manufactured from a corrosion-resistant material which is at least one of<br>
alloyed steel and nickel alloys and wherein the corrosion-resistant materials<br>
employed have a material loss rate of
