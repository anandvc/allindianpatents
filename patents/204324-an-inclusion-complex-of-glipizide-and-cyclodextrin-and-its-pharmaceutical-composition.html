PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of this invention and the manner in which it is to be performed :<br><br><br><br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to an inclusion complex of glipizide and cyclodextrin and its pharmaceutical composition.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The glipizide is of the following formula 1 :<br><br>
Formula 1<br>
Glipizide of the formula 1 is an oral blood glucose lowering drug of the sulfonyl urea class. The chemical abstracts name of glipizide is l-cyclohexyl-3-[[p-[2-(methylpyrazinecarboxamido) ethyl]phenyl] sulfonyl] urea. The molecular formula is C21H27N5O4S; and the molecular weight is 445.55. Glipzide is a whitish, odorless powder with pKa of 5.9. It is insoluble in water and alcohol but soluble in 0.IN NaOH.<br>
Glipizide is a hydrophobic drug with poor aqueous solubility at room temperature. Also, glipizide being a weakly acidic drug, its aqueous solubility in the acidic pH of gastric juice is even less. Hence, after oral administration the drug is likely to be absorbed only in the lower path of gastrointestinal tract. This probably explains the protracted onset of biological effect of glipizide, although other theories are possible to explain this observation.<br>
2<br><br>
For rapid onset of action of glipizide during high blood glucose level conditions, high bioavailability is required which in turn is achieved by high aqueous solubility thereof. In order to achieve aqueous solubility and hence maximum absorption of the drug glipizide, so that it exhibits good pharmacological behavior, inclusion complexes of glipizide with cyclodextrin or cyclodextrin derivatives are prepared. Such rapid dissolving drug formulations of glipizide can be timed to meal taking events.<br>
BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
One aspect of the invention is to provide an inclusion complex of glipizide and a nonionic surfactant with cyclodextrin, or a derivative thereof, which is safe for use as pharmaceutical composition, renders the active drug glipizide highly soluble in physiological pH as well as in gastric fluid pH, and permits rapid dissolution of the active drug glipizide in physiological pH as well as in gastric fluid pH.<br>
Another aspect of the invention is to provide a method for preparing an inclusion complex of glipizide and nonionic surfactant with cyclodextrin, or a derivative thereof, which results in a product safe for use as a pharmaceutical composition. Such a method is simple, less time consuming than conventional techniques, efficient and economical, and which renders the active drug glipizide highly soluble in physiological pH as well as in gastric fluid pH and also permits rapid dissolution of the active drug glipizide in physiological pH as well as in gastric fluid pH.<br>
3<br><br>
Another aspect of the invention is to provide a method for preparing an inclusion complex of glipizide and a nonionic surfactant with cyclodextrin, or a derivative thereof, which is suitable for manufacture of a product on commercial scale.<br>
Another object of the invention is to provide a pharmaceutical composition containing an inclusion complex of glipizide and a nonionic surfactant with cyclodextrin, or a derivative thereof, that is safe for use as a pharmaceutical renders the active drug glipizide highly soluble in physiological pH as well as in gastric fluid pH, and permits rapid dissolution of the active drug glipizide in physiological pH as well as in gastric fluid pH.<br>

Preferably polyoxyl-40-castor oil, polyoxyethylene-20-stearyl ether, polyoxyl-3 5 -castor oil, polyoxyethylene-20-sorbitan monooleate, polyoxyethylene-20-sorbitan monolaurate is used as the nonionic surfactant.<br>

The inclusion complex of glipizide and nonionic surfactant with the cyclodextrin of the invention is unreported hitherto and is novel. According to the invention the glipizide is in micronised particle sizes of 1.0 to 40 um for interaction with cyclodextrin or a derivative thereof. The micronised glipizide has increased surface area for better interaction with cyclodextrin or a cyclodextrin derivative. The solvent used is in considerably less quantity (solvent to cyclodextrin :: 1:3-6), and is sufficient to wet the cyclodextrin   and result in a semisolid reaction mixture.    The semisolid mixture of<br>
8<br><br>
cyclodextrin and nonionic surfactant is amenable to shear mixing with glipizide because of which it has been possible to obtain an inclusion complex in which the glipizide is uniformly distributed and dispersed in the cyclodextrin matrix. The nonionic surfactant reduces the surface tension at the glipizide-cyclodextrin interface and also balances the hydrophilic-hydrophobic forces exerted at the surface of cyclodextrin particles to facilitate dipersion and distribution of the glipizide into the cyclodextrin matrix. Due to the above reasons, the inclusion complex formation is very effective and rapid. Because the nonionic surfactant in the inclusion complex reduces surface tension at the inclusion complex-physiological fluid interface and the glipizide is in micronised sizes, the drug is rendered highly soluble in physiological fluid and also bioavailable. The shear mixed inclusion complexes prepared by the method of the invention show rapid and high aqueous solubility of glipizide (95% of dissolution at physiological pH of 6.8 within 15 minutes and 100% dissolution in within 30 minutes, 70% dissolution in neutral pH of water within 30 minutes and 45% dissolution in pH 1.2 (gastric fluid) within 30 minutes).<br>

EXAMPLE 21 :<br>
50 gm of glipizide was mixed with 260 gm of beta cyclodextrin to obtain a physical mixture containing 5 mg of glipizide per 31 mg of mixture and 10 mg of glipizide per 62 mg of the mixture. (Glipizide : Beta cyclodextrin :: 1 : 2)<br>
The inclusion complex of Example 1 was characterized as follows :<br>
1.        Quantitative determination of glipizide form inclusion complex by HPLC :<br>
The potency of the inclusion complex was calculated by HPLC with the following parameters.<br><br>
Mobile phase	Na Phosphate Buffer pH 6.0 : Methanol (55:45)<br>
Flow rate	1 ml per min.<br>
Temperature	Room temperature<br>
Column	15 cm X 3.9 mm, 5um with packing LI<br>
Detection wavelength	225 nm<br>
The retention time of glipizide was found to be 12.5 minutes. 32 mg of the inclusion complex (Example 1) contained 5.01 mg of glipizide. The assay level proved that glipizide was uniformly dispersed through out the inclusion complex.<br>
2.        Differential Scanning Calorimetry and NMR study :<br>
Thermograms of glipizide, beta cyclodextrin, a physical mixture of glipizide and beta cyclodextrin 1:2 and the glipizide-beta cyclodextrin inclusion complex of the present invention are as shown in figures 1A, IB, IC and ID respectively. The peak at 210° C in Fig 1A was due to the melting of glipizide. Fig 2B shows an endothermic peak at 168.1° C corresponding to beta cyclodextrin.  The physical mixture showed endothermic peaks<br>
16<br><br>
of both glipizide at 205° C and beta cyclodextrin at 161.5° C as seen in Fig 1C. The inclusion complex showed disappearance of the glipizide peak as seen in Fig ID. Disappearance of the glipizide peak at 210° C showed the formation of inclusion complex, which is further evidenced by 2D NOESY NMR spectra using Bruker 600 Hz FTNMR.<br>
3.        In-vitro Dissolution Studies :<br>
In-vitro dissolution studies of the glipizide inclusion complexes of the present invention and glipizide (micronised) at various physiological pH were as shown in Table 1:<br>

containing 5 mg of Glipizide.<br>

The results of #1, and #3, show that the glipizide inclusion complexes when prepared by the method of invention exhibit high in-vitro glipizide release at various physiological pH as compared to the physical mixture of glipizide with cyclodextrin indicated by the results of #2 and #4.<br>
The results of #1, and #3, when compared with that of #5 show that the in-vitro release of glipizide from glipizide raw material is much less as compared to that from the inclusion complex prepared by the method of invention.<br>
In-vitro dissolution studies of the inclusion complex of the invention and that of commercially available preparation of glipizide were shown in Table 2.<br>
