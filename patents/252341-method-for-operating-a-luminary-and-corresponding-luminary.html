				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>This invention relates in general to fluorescent lighting luminaries and more<br>
particularly to a new operating mode of fluorescent tubes in a luminary.<br>
A fluorescent tube is a discharge glass bulb whose inner side is covered with<br>
fluorescent layer that reacts by emitting visible light when excited by ultraviolet<br>
radiation sourced from the gas medium that fills the bulb. Such a gas contains very<br>
low pressure mercury vapor.<br>
Generally, a ballast is serial impedance that stabilizes the current in the fluorescent<br>
tube, Usually, as mentioned above, simple inductors are used as ballasts because<br>
they operate as reactances with small losses when serial coupled to the tube. Some<br>
magnetic ballasts provide more features than serial impedance for the tube like for<br>
instance transformers for increasing voltage levels.<br>
In the goal of energy saving, other types of ballast have been developed applying<br>
solutions that use semiconductors. This more sophisticated design brought also<br>
possibilities to use operating frequencies higher than conventional 50/60 Hz from<br>
main electric supply. Frequency in the range of 25 kHz has been employed.<br>
Examples of electronic Ballast design are described in patents WO 00/21342<br>
published April 2000, WO 99/05889 published February 1999, WO 97/33454<br>
published September 1997, WO 99/60825 published November 1999, WO 98/34438<br>
published August 1998 and EP-0-955794-A2 published November 1999. Exposed<br>
solutions relate mainly to current savings and life time improvement of fluorescent<br>
tubes by optimizing different parameters such as waveform, voltage amplitude...etc.<br>
American patent N°6,262,542 discloses an electronic Ballast including a lamp driving<br>
circuit having a pulse width modulated signal generator to control the duty cycle of<br>
the square wave form current flowing through the lamp. What is interesting to point<br>
out is not the current flowing through the lamp but moreover a control signal that is<br>
included into the circuitry for monitoring the lamp operation. It is also to note that<br><br>
lamp coupling method as described in patent N°6,262,542 forces the current to flow<br>
through the cathode's filaments.<br>
American patent N°4,902,939 discloses a driving circuitry dedicated to avoid light<br>
flickering when witching on and off the power from minimum to maximum variable<br>
lighting intensity. Obviously the objective is not to increase the power efficiency of<br>
fluorescent lamps. The major difference with the invention is that the driving voltage<br>
described in patent N°4,902,939 consists of sinusoidal waveforms directly derived<br>
from main power supply.<br>
Although existing electronic ballasts intend to bring energy savings through their<br>
operating modes of fluorescent tubes as well as to extend life time of fluorescent<br>
lamps, considerable research and development remain to be done in this domain.<br>
The invention discloses a particular brand new operating mode for fluorescent tubes<br>
that reduces current drawn by the lamp for 40% to 50% regarding to conventional<br>
magnetic ballasts mostly installed in fluorescent lighting fixtures.<br>
In addition, life time of tubes driven by the invention increases for up to 3 times and<br>
light emitted does not flicker or suffer stroboscopic effect.<br>
Above benefits are obtained by operating fluorescent luminaries the way disclosed in<br>
the invention, such luminaries including one or more standard fluorescent tubes that<br>
contain mercury vapor gas and heating filament cathodes at ends, a fixture that<br>
integers proper holding and connection devices for fluorescent tubes and one ballast<br>
for driving the fluorescent tubes. Ballast operating mode differs from existing<br>
systems by the fact that it uses voltage pulses applied to the electrodes for exciting<br>
the fluorescent gas, such pulses consisting of short time non periodic voltage levels<br>
separated by variable duration dead times.<br>
In a preferred implementation, the ballast generates pulses composed of perfectly<br>
alternate voltage amplitudes. The ballast is also able to control the timing of pulses<br>
as well as the dead times by using programmed algorithms. Another benefit can<br>
result in monitoring dead times between pulses from real time samplings of the<br>
current in the tube. Special coupling installed in tube's connections are controlled by<br>
the ballast to short cut cathode's filaments on right time, in order to cancel any<br>
current flow through it and so avoid losses of voltage. Ignition of conduction in the<br>
tube can profit of temporarily connecting a capacitor that seriously increases voltage<br>
at ends of every fluorescent tube and is disconnected as soon as the conduction<br>
establishes. The ballast modifies the current in the tube after the conduction<br>
happens in order to reduce the current in the capacitor to the minimum before<br>
disconnecting it.<br>
In a preferred implementation, the ballast can communicate with an control unit<br>
through a wired or wireless link for performance monitoring and remote failure<br>
detection.<br>
In another aspect, the invention also relates to luminaries that fit in with multiple<br>
standard fluorescent tubes containing mercury vapor gas and heating cathodes<br>
located at both ends, and consisting of a fixture including tube connection/holding<br>
devices and a ballast for operating fluorescent tubes.<br>
The luminary according to the invention differs from existing systems by the fact that<br>
it uses voltage pulses applied to the electrodes for exciting the fluorescent gas, such<br>
pulses consisting of short time non periodic voltage levels separated by variable<br>
duration dead times.<br>
In a particularly preferred implementation form of the invention, the ballast can be<br>
advantageously adapted to generate pulses composed of alternate voltage<br>
amplitude. The ballast is also able to control the timing of pulses as well as the dead<br>
times by using programmed algorithms.<br>
In an even more preferred implementation form, the ballast is adapted to monitor<br><br>
dead time between pulses from real time samplings of the current that crosses gas<br>
in the fluorescent tubes.<br>
Fluorescent tube's connectors include special couplings that can be activated by the<br>
ballast to short cut the cathode's filaments on right time, in order to cancel any<br>
current flow through it and so avoid losses of voltage.<br>
A capacitor can be connected to increase the voltage at ends of every fluorescent<br>
tube allowing to ignite the conduction through the gas, and can be disconnected as<br>
soon as the conduction establishes. In this case, the ballast can be adapted further<br>
to modify the current in the tube after the conduction happens in order to reduce the<br>
current in the capacitor to the minimum before disconnecting it.<br>
It is particularly appropriate when many luminaries are used in a single place that the<br>
ballasts have on line or wireless link with a central control unit, for performance<br>
monitoring and remote failure detection.<br>
In some implementation, the ballast includes two parts, the first being a standard<br>
ballast operating at normal main power supply voltage, and the second being<br>
specifically designed to operate with the non periodic short pulses as described in<br>
the invention.<br>
The invention is also presented under a third form, namely as a voltage supply<br>
signal for the fluorescent tubes in normal operating condition, which signal being<br>
formed of pulses characterized by including non periodic short time voltage levels<br>
separated by variable length dead times. Preferably, the signal pulses are of<br>
alternative nature i.e. the signal includes equal amplitudes of positive and negative<br>
polarity.<br>
The invention will be developed more in detail below, by means of examples of<br>
implementation form, and it will refers to the diagrams attached, where:<br>
- figure 1 represents a simplified traditional diagram of a fluorescent tube with a<br>
magneto-inductive ballast and a starter,<br>
- figure 2 represents a comparison between a conventional magneto-inductive<br>
ballast and the new ballast according to the present invention,<br>
- figure 3 shows schematically how the new ballast according to the present<br>
invention is installed in an existing luminary,<br>
- figure 4 shows schematically how a set of luminaries can interconnect in a network<br>
for remote monitoring.<br>
Figure 1 in appendix represents the simplest shape of a magneto-inductive type<br>
ballast in series with a fluorescent tube, in which the electric main voltage supplies<br>
the tube with a frequency of 50 or 60 Hz. This kind of ballast with possibly some<br>
minor evolutions, are mostly used in today luminaries. Although some manufacturers<br>
are seeking to market new electronic ballasts since a while, luminaries equipped<br>
with such electronic ballasts have higher costs that significantly restrain a broad<br>
diffusion of these technologies.<br>
The present invention characterizes a new kind of electronic ballast different from<br>
existing systems by the fact that it is intended to replace the conventional magnetic<br>
ballast in existing luminaries without need of removing the original magnetic ballast<br>
when installing the ballast from the invention.<br>
Figure 2 schematically represents the action of the new ballast designed with the<br>
invention. The operation of a fluorescent tube equipped with conventional magnetic<br>
ballast is illustrated in the upper part of figure 2. It shows that the excitation of<br>
mercury atoms by the collision of an electron flowing between the pre-heating<br>
electrodes occurs randomly and relatively seldom (cf the only collision represented<br><br>
inducing light radiation).<br>
At the opposite, the bottom of figure 2 represents the action of the new ballast<br>
working with voltage levels of a very different nature. The latter induces much more<br>
collisions and consequently excites more mercury atoms. This phenomenon is<br>
illustrated on the figure by three collisions leading to higher ultraviolet radiation. The<br>
efficiency increases from the standard level of 65 lumens per unit of power (Watt) for<br>
the conventional magnetic ballast to a value of 120 lumens per Watt by using the<br>
new ballast from the invention.<br>
The main point concerning the impact of the new ballast on the lighting efficiency is<br>
that the ignition voltage applied to a fluorescent tube, i.e. from one electrode to the<br>
other, is a high frequency alternative voltage consisting in short time non periodic<br>
pulses separated by variable duration dead times.<br>
This special voltage waveform is generated so that every dead time (time of no<br>
voltage) is monitored from real time samplings of the current flow crossing the tube.<br>
The current intensity depends on a resonance effect in the gas that significantly<br>
increases the number of collisions between electrons and mercury atoms. By using<br>
this resonance phenomenon, the power consumption can be considerably reduced.<br>
The high frequency voltage is used to be just sufficient to maintain the resonance<br>
and the voltage level is void as long as the resonance phenomenon maintains the<br>
light emission. The current measurement reveals instantaneously the resonance<br>
effect, allowing the microprocessor included in the ballast to monitor the voltage<br>
waveform in real time.<br>
The voltage pulses are preferably of completely alternative form, i.e. using voltages<br>
of same amplitudes and opposite polarity, and are non periodic events. The<br>
waveform is real time controlled through programmed algorithms, embedded in the<br>
ballast's microprocessor.<br><br>
These algorithms refer preferably to measurements of the current crossing the<br>
plasma in the tube for controlling particularly the dead time duration between pulses<br>
according to the value of the current level. The current is continuous real time<br>
sampling.<br>
As appearing in figure 3, an existing luminary is equipped with a new kit of<br>
components, especially designed to fit the luminary. This new kit includes in addition<br>
to the electronic ballast from the invention, new tube connectors that are inserted in<br>
place of the original plugs. The old components are left in place (i.e. magnetic ballast<br>
and starter) and the new ballast is connected to the main power supply bus by using<br>
quick coupling devices.<br>
The new connectors include preferably special coupling devices the new ballast can<br>
activated to short cut the filaments of the cathodes in order to void any current flow<br>
through them and thus cancel losses of voltage.<br>
To ignite conduction in the fluorescent tube, a capacitor is briefly connected in<br>
parallel with the tube in order to increase the voltage between the electrodes. As<br>
soon as conduction is produced through the mercury vapor, the capacitor is<br>
disconnected. The ballast adapts the current through the mercury vapor once<br>
conduction occurs, in a way that current crossing the capacitor is reduced to the<br>
minimum before removing the capacitor.<br>
The new operating mode of fluorescent tube as described is based on the principle<br>
aiming to increasing the number of collisions between electrons and mercury atoms<br>
in molecular excitation of plasma medium where a new voltage waveform improves<br>
the lighting energy efficiency. The high frequency alternate signal that is used<br>
comprises accurate monitored dead time phases that contribute to reduce energy<br>
consumption to the minimum.<br><br>
The process is optimized by constant monitoring of the current flowing through the<br>
tube and continuous regulation of the dead time, according to the programmed<br>
functions that supervise the conditions and physical parameters coupling voltage<br>
variations and collision rate between electrons and mercury atoms.<br>
The program is included in an electronic device placed in the new ballast that is<br>
installed in luminaries. This electronic device looks like a "macrochip" electronic<br>
component including all processes of controlling and monitoring functions. The<br>
electronic device consists of a controller (central processing unit) which integrates<br>
the software in a secured and protected chip also containing coded functions which<br>
make it available only under precise conditions, in order to avoid any undesired<br>
access to the operation and program.<br>
It should be noted that frequencies and voltage waveforms are in a much higher<br>
range of frequency than the main supply. In addition, it should be underlined that the<br>
variations of voltage are non sinusoidal and not periodic. The voltage variation<br>
includes dead time phases in which current in the tube is void. Because of this<br>
particular operating mode, it is not necessary that some current crosses the<br>
filaments of electrodes for maintaining the flow of electrons in the tube.<br>
Because of appearance of a resonance phenomenon increasing the number of<br>
collisions between electrons generated by cathodes and mercury atoms in the gas,<br>
the operating mode according to the invention as stated above, reduces the<br>
operating temperature and improves electronic ballast reliability.<br>
Optimal operation thanks to control pre-heating of cathodes and specific excitation<br>
mode during ignition of conduction of the vapor whatever the temperature in the<br>
tube. The nominal running mode is thus reached gradually, as the resonance<br>
phenomenon maintained by the process stabilizes. During this phase of progressive<br>
transformation which requires a few minutes, the current crossing the tube<br>
increases, as well as the emission of light, by successive steps. At the end of this<br><br>
phase, the phenomenon of resonance is stable according to the specific<br>
environmental conditions. Current decreases gradually and reaches a minimum<br>
average value after approximately 15 minutes.<br>
Thanks to the use of the procedure according to the invention, the temperature of<br>
the electrodes can be lowered by more than 40° C, which has a significant incidence<br>
over the lifespan of the tube.<br>
Figure 4 shows how a greater number of luminaries, each of them integrating the<br>
new ballast, is connected via a special communication bus to a central control unit.<br>
This unit can be local or remote, as shown on figure 4. In this example, a wireless<br>
connection in the form of SMS messages using GSM is used. In this type of control<br>
unit, the performance of the lighting system of a site can be recorded and the<br>
operation be permanently and remotely monitored in case of a breakdown. This<br>
makes it possible to provide to the users statistics and reports of precise operations<br>
statistics and reports stating amongst other things the energy consumption while<br>
making it possible to intervene more quickly when maintenance is necessary.<br>
FIG1 is a diagram describing the principle of construction and operation of a single<br>
fluorescent tube luminary. A flux of electrons, crossing the tube between the two<br>
electrodes placed at each end, excites mercury atoms and produces ultraviolet<br>
radiation. These electrodes consist of electron thermo-emissive filaments (called pre<br>
heating Cathodes) that must heat to incandescent. The alternative main current<br>
voltage is used to supply power to the cathodes through a high inductive coil (called<br>
Ballast) included to the circuit, that limits the current drawn by the low impedance<br>
ionized gas to an acceptable value.<br>
Igniting the conduction through the gas requires a special device (called Starter)<br>
connecting the heating filaments directly one to the other, in parallel with the gas<br>
medium (see Fig.1, low section). The starter may consist of a filament bulb including<br>
a switch reacting to temperature opened at normal temperature. When the power is<br>
applied to the circuit, the current starter bulb lights on and internal temperature goes<br>
up rapidly while the cathodes of the fluorescent tube are incandescent. When the<br>
temperature is high enough, the switch closes, short cutting the starter which rapidly<br>
decreases in temperature and thus opens again the switch. Interrupting suddenly the<br>
current induces a high voltage surge at coil's outputs (self induction effect) igniting<br>
conduction between the two cathodes, through the mercury vapor heated by the<br>
incandescent filaments. From this point, the starter is no more activated as long as<br>
the conduction of the vapor remains. The filaments of the cathodes stay<br>
incandescent due to their construction and position that drive a part of the current<br>
crossing the tube to flow through their surface also hit by mercury ions that help to<br>
maintain temperature by dissipating collision energy.<br>
As conduction is ignited and current stabilizes, tube's impedance decreases<br>
significantly. Due to its value of impedance at operating frequency of the main<br>
power, the ballast coil ensures proper current limitation. Such a system is defined as<br>
"magneto-inductive ballast".<br>
However, some evolutions exist in ballast technology that improve the simple<br>
description above, and stated in figure 1.<br>
