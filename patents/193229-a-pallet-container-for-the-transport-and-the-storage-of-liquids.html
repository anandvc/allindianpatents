The invention relates to a pallet container for the transport and the storage of liquids, with a parallelepiped-shaped inner container with a filler neck which can be sealed and a discharge connecting piece for the connection of a drain fitting, which has a drain bottom and outer jacket made of lattice or sheet-metal jacket and is in a flat bottom tray made of sheet-metal or plastic and designed as a pallet.<br>
The need to save raw materials as well as transport and storage costs and the legal environmental protection regulations force the relevant industry to fill with liquids large-volume containers of the generic type which are offered on the market and which can be used as reusable containers according to DE 42 06 945 CI instead of as in the past barrels with significantly smaller capacity, for transport and for storage.<br>
The generic pallet container does not offer the safety required for the transport of environmentally hazardous liquids of a high hazard class.<br>
The object of the invention is zo  develop the generic pallet container with respect to optimum transport safety for dangerous liquids as well as an economical reconditioning capacity for a multiple use.<br><br>
This object is achieved according to the invention by a pallet container with the features of the claim.<br>
The pallet container according to the inventioD represents the optimum attainment of the set object.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a pallet container for the transport and the storage of liquids, with a parallelepiped-shaped inner container with a scalable filler neck and a discharge connecting piece for the connection of a drain fitting, which has a drain bottom and an outer jacket designed as a lattice or sheet-metal jacket and is in a flat bottom tray made of sheet-metal or plastic and designed as a pallet, characterized in that inner container consists of an outer shell made of sheet steel with jacket, bottom part with drain bottom and cover as well as of liquid-tight, elastic inner shell made of plastic, jacket of outer shell is connected by a folding seam connection or clinch connection to bottom part and cover and in that filler neck of elastic inner shell of inner container is passed through firom inside by corresponding filler neck in cover of outer shell and locked with its upper annular edge to upper edge of filler neck in cover of outer shell.<br>
The new pallet container is explained below with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which.<br><br>
Fig. 1   shows a perspective representation of the pallet<br>
container, Fig. 2   shows a cutaway representation of a folded seam connection of cover and jacket of the inner container of the pallet container, Fig. 3   shows a further embodiment of the folded seam connection of cover and jac&gt;;et of the inner container and Fig. 4    shows a clinch connection of cover and jacket:<br>
of the inner container. Pallet container 1 that can be used as a disposable or reusable container for the transport and the storage especially of environmentally hazardous liquids of a high hazard class has as main components parallelepiped-shaped inner container 2 with rounded corners, outer jacket 3 which is r.ade of crossing vertical and horizontal metal lattice bars 4, 5 and which is reinforced bv four corner supports 6 made of steel with an angle<br><br>
like cover 10 with two V-shaped lattice bars 11, 12 for the protection of inner container 2 and for stiffening of lattice jacket 3.<br>
Inner container 2 consists of outer shell 13 made of sheet steel with jacket 14, bottom part 15 with drain bottom 16 and cover 17 as well as of liquid-tight, elastic inner shell 18 made of polyethylene and produced as a blown part, with drain bottom 19 matched to drain bottom 16 of outer shell 13.<br>
Jacket 14 and cover 17 of outer shell 13 of inner container 2 are fastened to one another by folded seam connections 20, 21 according to Figures 2 and 3 or by clinch connection 22 according to Fig. 4.<br>
To produce horizontal folded seam connection 2 0 according to Fig. 2, beveled upper jacket edge 23 which is wider than cover edge 24 is bent inward around cover edge 24 and in the production of vertical folded seam connection 21 according to Fig. 3, jacket edge 23 is rolled inward around cover edge 24.<br>
In the production of clinch connection 22 according to Fig. 4, a pre-profiled lock ring 2 5 made of sheet metal is mounted on cover edge 24 which is beveled upward and rolled around jacket edge 2 3 which is beveled downward.<br>
In the same way, jacket 14 and bottom part 15 of outer shell 13 of inner container 2 are folded together or clinched with one another.<br>
Cover 17 of outer shell 13 of inner container 2 is equipped with filler neck 26 which can be sealed by a screw cap 27 and<br><br>
bottom part 15 of outer shell 13 is equipped with discharge connecting piece 28 with drain cock 29.<br>
When assembling inner container 2, first jacket 14 and bottom part 15 of outer shell 13 are folded together or clinched with one another.  Then plastic inner shell 18 is inserted into open outer shell 13, the discharge connecting piece of inner shell 18, not shown, being fitted into discharge connecting piece 28 of outer shell 13.  At this point filler neck 30 of elastic inner shell 18 is passed through filler neck 26 from inside in cover 17 of outer shell 13 and locked with its upper annular edge 31 to upper edge 32, which is rerolled outward, of filler neck 26 in cover 17 of outer shell 13.  Finally, jacket 14 and cover 17 of outer shell 13 are folded together or clinched with one another.<br>
To recondition pallet container 1, inner container 2 is removed from the latter after opening cover 10 of lattice jacket 3, and plastic inner shell 18 of inner container 2 can be replaced after removing folded seam connection or clinching connection 20, 21 or 22 from cover 17 and jacket 14 of outer shell 13.<br><br><br>
WE CLAIM:<br>
1.	A pallet container for the transport and the storage of liquids, with a<br>
parallelepiped-shaped inner container with a sealable filler neck and a discharge<br>
connecting piece for the connection of a drain fitting, which has a drain bottom and an<br>
outer jacket designed as a lattice or sheet-metal jacket and is in a flat bottom tray<br>
made of sheet-metal or plastic and designed as a pallet, characterized in that inner<br>
container (2) consists of an outer shell (13) made of sheet steel with jacket (14),<br>
bottom part (15) with drain bottom (16) and cover (17) as well as of liquid-tight,<br>
elastic inner shell (18) made of plastic, jacket (14) of outer shell (13) is connected by<br>
a folding seam connection (20, 21) or clinch connection (22) to bottom part (15) and<br>
cover (17) and in that filler neck (30) of elastic inner shell (18) of inner container (2)<br>
is passed through from inside by corresponding filler neck (26) in cover (17) of outer<br>
shell (13) and locked with its upper annular edge (31) to upper edge (32) of filler<br>
neck (26) in cover (17) of outer shell (13).<br>
2.	A pallet container for the transport and the storage of liquids, substantially as<br>
herein above described and illustrated with reference to the accompanying drawings.<br><br></td>
