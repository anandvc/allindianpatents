CONTROLLED RELEASE PRESS-COATED FORMULATIONS OF WATER-SOLUBLE ACTIVE AGENTS<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION The invention relates to controlled release press-coated formulations of water-soluble active agents.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Controlled delivery of active agents is often desirable, especially with respect to oral delivery of pharmaceutically active agents to patients. Controlled delivery of pharmaceutically active agents, for example, helps avoid the overdosing or under-dosing that can result from uncontrolled release. Attempts have been made to achieve controlled delivery of various active agents. However, each of these attempts have suffered from several drawbacks.<br>
Oral osmotic delivery systems can require substantial amounts of organic solvent to prepare the coating that provides controlled release of the active agent. In addition, a hole must be provided in each tablet to allow the active agent to be dissolved and released from<br>
the tablet in a controlled manner. Further, the spent tablet undesirably retains its size after<br>
r<br>
delivery of the active agent which the patient must pass.<br>
Erodible matrices can provide suitable controlled release of water-insoluble active agents. However, controlled release of water soluble active agents is difficult because, among other things, the active agent embedded in the matrix is likely to dissolve at a rate faster than the rate the matrix erodes.<br><br>
Active coated inert spheres can provide suitable controlled release of an active agent in lower dosages, but are costly. In addition, for larger doses, coated inert spheres are undesirable because, among other things, a significant portion of the volume of the core is taken up by the non-active sphere core particle.<br>
Standard control release coatings on active agent core formulations also have problems, especially with highly water-soluble drugs. Aqueous coating solutions can result in redistribution and early degradation of the active agent. Further, organic solvents in the coating process are costly and pose safety and environmental concerns.<br>
Press-coated tablets are also problematic because, for example, the core must be placed precisely in the center of the die. A core that is off slightly to one side or the other could result in the uncontrolled delivery of the active agent. For larger doses, press-coated tablets are undesirable because the large off-center core results in the core being extremely close to the outer boundary of the press-coat, or even not coated at all by the press-coat.<br>
The invention overcomes these and other problems by providing a press-coat formulation of water-soluble active agents in a controlled release core which is press-coated with a controlled release coating formulation also comprising the water-soluble active agents therein.<br><br>
BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The invention provides a press-coat composition comprising (a) a core composition comprising a water-soluble active agent and a waxy material and (b) a coating composition comprising the water-soluble active agent and a hydrophilic polymer, wherein the coating composition is press-coated onto the core.<br>

In certain other preferred embodiments is provided a press-coat composition comprising (a) a core composition comprising a water-soluble active agent and a waxy material, (b) a coating composition comprising the water-soluble active agent and a hydrophilic polymer, wherein the coating composition is press-coated onto the core, and (c) an additional coating composition comprising the water-soluble active agent.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention is provided a press-coat composition comprising (a) a core composition comprising a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of methylphenidate and a waxy material and (b) a coating composition comprising the<br><br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT OF THE INVENTION<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention is provided a dosage form of a water-soluble active agent, the dosage form comprising a core and a coating formulation press-coated on the core, wherein the core comprises a waxy material and the water-soluble active agent and wherein the coating composition comprises a hydrophilic polymer and the water-soluble active agent.<br>
By "water-soluble" active agent is meant to include active agents that are at least slightly water-soluble (for example, about 1 to about 10 mg/ml at 25 °C). In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the active agent is moderately water-soluble (for example, less than about 100 mg/ml at 25°C). In another preferred embodiment of the invention, the active agent is highly water-soluble (for example, greater than about 100 mg/ml at 25°C). Preferably, the active agent is highly water soluble.<br>
The active agents of the invention include any active agent for which controlled release is desirable. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the active agent is a pharmaceutically acceptable active agent and includes phaimaceutical and veterinary active agents (often referred to as drugs). In other embodiments, the active agent includes agrichemical agents (such as fertilizers, herbicides, pesticides and fungicides), active agent used in the exterminating industry (such as toxins and poisons), and active agents used in industrial manufacturing (such as catalysts or catalytic quenchers).<br><br>
Exemplary active agents for use in the pharmaceutical and veterinary applications of the invention include analgesics, anesthetics, anticonvulsants, antidiabetic agents, antihistamines, anti-infectives, antineoplastics, antiparkinsonian agents, antirheumatic agents, appetite stimulants, appetite suppressants, blood modifiers, bone metabolism modifiers, cardiovascular agents, central nervous system depressants, central nervous system stimulants, decongestants, dopamine receptor agonists, electrolytes, gastrointestinal agents, immunomodulators, muscle relaxants, narcotics, parasympathomimetics, sympathomimetics, sedatives, and hypnotics.<br>
In certain preferred embodiments of the invention, the active agent includes methylphenidate, fluoxetine, or oxybutynin. More preferably, the active agent includes pharmaceutically acceptable salts of methylphenidate (including the B-threo and L-threo forms and mixtures thereof), fluoxetine or oxybutynin. Most preferably, the active agent is selected from methylphenidate hydrochloride, fluoxetine hydrochloride, and oxybutynin chloride. Other pharmaceutically acceptable active agents having solubility in water similar to these preferred compounds are also contemplated to be within the scope of the invention.<br>
The term "active agent" is meant to include solvates (including hydrates) of the free compound or salt, crystalline and non-crystalline forms, as well as various polymoiphs. For example, the active agent "methylphenidate" can include all optical isomers of the compound and all pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof either alone or in combination (the combined threo isomers can be indicated as "threo" and the combined erythro isomers as<br><br>
"erythro"). In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the methylphenidate is a dl-threo methylphenidate hydrochloride. More preferably, the methylphenidate is a d-threo methylphenidate hydrochloride.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention, a core comprising an active agent and a waxy controlled release agent is coated with a press-coat formulation also comprising the active agent and a hydrophilic polymer controlled release agent.<br>
The invention provides drug formulations having substantially zero order, first order, and second order release rate profiles by adjusting the amount of active agent in the core and the press-coat formulation. The ratio of the active agent in the core (CoreAA) to active agent in the press-coat (CoatAA) preferably ranges from about 1:99 to about 99:1, more preferably from about 95:5 to about 5:99, most preferably from about 9:1 to about 1:9. For the highly soluble active agents, including methylphenidate hydrochloride, fluoxetine hydrochloride, and oxybutynin chloride, a CoreAA:CoatAA of about 3:4 to about 5:3 is preferred to provide a substantially zero order release rate, a CoreAA:CoatAA of less than about 3:4 is preferred to provide a substantially first order release rate, and a CoreAA:CoatAA of greater than about 5:3 is preferred to provide a substantially second order release rate.<br>
The waxy material is preferably selected from hydrophobic waxy materials to provide controlled release of the active agent. In pharmaceutical and/or veterinary products, for example, such waxy materials are preferably selected from materials such as carnauba<br><br>
wax, tribehenin, fatty alcohols (particularly those having 12-24 carbon atoms, such as lauryl alcohol, myristyl alcohol, stearyl alcohol, palmityl alcohol, etc such as stearyl alcohol), fatty acids (particularly those having 12-24 carbon atoms, such as lame acid, myristic acid, stearic acid, palmitic acid, etc), polyethylenes, castor wax, C16-30 fatty acid triglycerides, beeswax, and mixtures thereof. Preferably, the core comprises carnauba wax.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the core further includes a filler, such as a water insoluble filler, water soluble filler, and mixtures thereof. Preferably, the filler is a water-insoluble filler, such as calcium salt or talc. In a preferred embodiment, the calcium salt is a calcium phosphate, more preferably a dicalcium phosphate. Exemplary water-soluble fillers include water soluble sugars and sugar alcohols, preferably lactose, glucose, fructose, sucrose, mannose, galactose, the corresponding sugar alcohols and other sugar alcohols, such as mannitol, sorbitol, and xylitol.<br>
Other excipients can also be present in the core formulation, including lubricants (such as talc and magnesium stearate), glidants (such as filmed or colloidal silica), pH modifiers (such as acids, bases and buffer systems), and pharmaceutically useful processing aids.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the core components (active agent, wax and optional excipients) are blended together and compressed into suitable cores. The blending can take place in any order of addition. Preferably, the cores are blended by starting<br><br>
with the smallest volume component and then successively adding the larger volume components. Another preferred process is to melt the wax and to blend the active agent and optional excipients into the melted wax. Alternatively, the active agent, wax and optional excipients can be blended together and then subjected to a temperature at which the wax will melt. Once cooled, the solidified mass can be milled into granules for compaction into cores.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the hydrophilic polymer in the press-coat composition provides for the controlled release of the active agent. Preferably, the hydrophilic polymer for providing controlled release is a film forming polymer, such as a hydrophilic cellulose polymer. Preferably, the hydrophilic cellulose polymer is a hydroxyalkyl cellulose polymer, such as hydroxyethylcellulose (HEC), hydroxypropyl cellulose (HPC), hydroxypropylmethylcellulose (HPMC), hydroxypropylethylcellulose (HPEC), hydroxypropylpropylcellulose (HPPC), and hydroxypropylbutylcellulose (HPBC). Most preferably, the controlled release agent is HPMC.<br>
The press-coat composition can optionally include fillers, such as water soluble fillers, a water-insoluble fillers, and mixtures thereof. Preferably, the filler is water-soluble. Exemplary water soluble fillers include a water-soluble sugar, lactose, glucose, fructose, sucrose, galactose, mannose, the corresponding sugar alcohols and other sugar alcohols, such as mannitol, sorbitol, and xylitol. Most preferably, the water soluble filler is lactose or granulated mannitol. The water-insoluble fillers can include, for example, calcium salt or talc. A preferred insoluble calcium salt is a calcium phosphate, more preferably dicalcium<br><br>
phosphate. The filler in the press-coat composition can be the same or different as the filler in the core composition, if any. For example, the core composition can include a water soluble filler while the press coat composition can include a water-insoluble filler. In a preferred embodiment, the filler material is the same in both the core and the press-coat compositions.<br>
The press-coat composition can optionally include other excipients, such as lubricants, processing aids, pH buffers, glidants, and the like, which can be the same or different as those in the core composition, if any.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the core composition is press-coated with the press-coat composition to form a tablet. The tablet can be further coated with optional additional coatings. The additional coatings can be pH-dependent or pH-independent, aesthetic or functional, and can include the active agent in immediate or controlled release. Such additional coatings preferably include film forming materials. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the additional coating is an aesthetic coating. In another preferred embodiment, the additional coating includes an active agent, either the same or different as the active agent contained in the core and press-coat. Preferably, the active agent in the additional coating is an active agent that is desirably administered along with the active agent in the core and press-coat formulations. In other preferred embodiments, the additional coating includes an immediate release loading dose of the same active agent that is found in the core and press-coat formulations.<br><br>

then given a further immediate release "loading dose" of an additional 10 mg of<br>
methylphenidate hydrochloride per tablet.<br><br>
Active agent release rate data was obtained for these tablets using USP Apparatus 2 at 50 rpm using 900ml of either water or 0.1 N HC1 as the dissolution media. The results are shown in Figures 1(a) through 1(c).<br>
Example 2<br>
The cores of Example 1 were used with a press-coat composition containing (per<br>
tablet):<br><br><br>
