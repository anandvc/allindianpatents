				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
This application is a continuation-in-part of provisional U.S. Patent Application No. 60/038,186, filed on February 14, 1997, hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety herein, which is a continuation-in-part of U.S. Patent Application No. 08/705,434, filed on August 29, 1996, hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety herein, which in turn is a continuation-in-part of provisional application no. 60/019,945, filed on June 14, 1996, hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety herein: Field of the Invention<br>
This invention relates generally to powder feed systems and to delivery methods for feeding and depositing finely divided or particulate material into a die cavity of a powder press for compacting. More particularly, the invention relates to a feeding system and delivery method that provides for uniform density distribution of the particles throughout the die cavity. The feeding system and delivery method also provides a uniform, predetermined constant weight of particulate material into the die cavity. In one embodiment, the invention provides an apparatus and method for delivering particulate material to the die cavity of a powder press without the use of a shuttle. The invention is also directed to a feeding system that includes a scale apparatus for accurately measuring the weight of particulate material before it is delivered to a die cavity. Description of Related Art<br>
In powder metallurgy, products and parts are formed by pressing finely ground or atomized metal powders into a desired shape within a die cavity of a powder press.<br>
Generally, the metal powders are compacted in the die cavity at room temperature and the then semi-dense "green* compact is removed from the die and heated at very high temperatures (at or near the melting point of the material) to bond the powders into a unified mass. The heat bonding procedure is generally known in powder metallurgy as sintering or analogously in the fields of ceramics and carbides, firing.<br>
When these and similar procedures are employed, means are required for delivering amounts of powder or particulate material to the die cavity of the press. Typically, feed shoes operate to deliver the powder or particulate material to the die cavity during the press cycle by using a gravity fill system. This system involves the movement of the feed shoe containing particulate material on a shuttle which slides the shoe forward along the table of the die press to a position at which the bottom feed hole of the feed shoe is exposed, overlies and registers with the die cavity furnishing enough loose powder under the action of gravity to fill the die cavity volumetrically. Thereafter, the shuttle slides the shoe back along the table of the die press into a retracted position. This action cuts off the gravity induced flow of particulate material from the bottom hole of the feed shoe. The particulate material in the die cavity is then compressed into an article and the article is ejected from the die. The shuttle then slides the shoe forward along the table of the die press displacing the ejected article and again exposing the bottom hole of the feed shoe as it overlies and registers with the die cavity. Gravity is thereby once again used to fill the die cavity with particulate material more or less volumetrically. Very small recesses of the die cavity de net however fill uniformly. The feed shoe is then once again<br>
retracted to cut off the gravity flow of participate material into the cavity.<br>
The  aforementioned  typical  example  of  a  feed  shoe delivers particulate material by volume (volumetric).  Such volumetric feed shoes depend on a consistent bulk density and good flow characteristics (low Hall Numbers) of the powder material they are delivering for an accurate and uniform feed rate.  However, because many of the powdered materials used are heavy and dense, they have a tendency to self compact. Furthermore, the die cavities used to make very large parts with fine detail are particularly difficult to fill uniformly. Thus,  these anc? other volumetric feed shoes and delivery methods are generally inadequate and unsatisfactory to provide for very precise uniform distribution and hence density of the powder throughout the die cavity.  Consequently, the density of parts made from these powder compacts is not uniform throughout and is not consistently uniform from part to part. These  parts  are  then  prone  to  stress  related  cracking, especially upon ejection from the die cavity.  To make matters worse,  the  cracks  oftentimes  become  visible  only  upon sintering.<br>
Additionally, complex part shapes and parts having tight<br>
dimensional tolerances such as helical gears and sprockets<br>
cannot be satisfactorily produced using commonly available<br>
powder feed methods and feed shoes. Since these prior art<br>
methods and feed shoes use gravity alone to induce the flow of<br>
the parficuiate material into the die cavity and are thus<br>
unable to deliver powder uniformly to all regions of the<br>
complex die shapes needed to produce an item such as a helical<br>
gear cr cprocket.	<br>
Specifically, powder simply falls from the feed shoe into the die without any particular pattern or regularity of<br>
density. Certain regions of the dies, particularly complexly shaped dies, receive more particulate material than other regions. The resultant parts are therefore irregular in density, subject to failure, and as a result, of questionable commercial use.<br>
Traditional volumetric powder feed methods are further hindered by the inability to control the weight of material delivered into the die making it impossible to provide uniform weight from part to part. Hence, this further limits the uses for parts made by powder metallurgy.<br>
Typically, as a solution to the problem of irregular powder density in the die cavity, vhen using a powder such as for example, aluminum powder, -shaking or vibrating the feed hopper is employed for inducing flow of the particulate<br>
s<br>
material and regularizing the density of the powder in the die. This is, however, time consuming, inaccurate, and not adequate to achieve sufficiently uniform density from part to part and throughout the part itself.<br>
As a further disadvantage, shaking fine powders dislodges "fines" and dust from the powder which are then air borne to coat and contaminate the surrounding environs. Many of the powdered materials used in powder metallurgy to make parts are frequently quite costly and in some cases, toxic. Airborne aluminum powders are also quite explosive. Hence, the dust problem can represent a considerable economic loss or health and safety hazard. Consequently, relatively elaborate and costly dust recovery systems and personnel safety precautions, such as filtered masks are presently used.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 3,697,208 to Munk et al. is directed to an apparatus for filling molds with comminuted fibrous materials by blowing the material into the mold. The air used to blow the material into the mold escapes out of a perforated<br>
plate or screen placed on top of the mold for preventing the loss of material from the mold during the blowing step. This apparatus is however, unsuitable for delivering all types of particulate material into a mold, especially metals which tend to be heavier and would therefore not move in the open system described in Munk et al. The Munk et al. process works like a sand-blaster to draw powder into an air stream that precedes the powder supply. The air to powder ratios are large and the time to fill is small. Moreover, uniform density of pressed powder parts could not be satisfactorily obtained because of the powders that fly up toward the perforated plate or screen during delivery. The requirement of a screen also mikes it impossible to make parts that do not have flat top surfaces.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 4,813,818 to Sanzone discloses a feed shoe having a hopper for receiving powder materials from a source that communicates through a feeder tube with an enclosed filling chamber. The filling chamber is equipped with a vacuum. The vacuum is applied to assist the gravity flow of the powders through the feeder tube into the filling chamber. Such evacuation of the chamber does not however provide for the strict uniformity of density that is necessary to produce articles such as materials for thermal management applications, articles having tight dimensional control, etc. In thermal management materials strict uniformity of properties (i.e., coefficient of thermal expansion, thermal conductivity, etc.) throughout the article and from article to article is required. The Sanzone evacuation also does not provide for delivery of precisely controlled weights of powder to the die cavity. Further, using Sanzone, the driving force on the powders can never exceed atmosphere.<br>
In  addition,  there  presently  exists  technology  for controlling and moving mechanical parts of die presses at much<br>
faster rates than are presently being used. The rate at which die presses can produce articles is limited by the rate at which the die cavity can be filled with particulate materials. This rate is relatively slow using known methods for delivering particles and feed shoes which use gravity to feed powders into the die cavity. Hence, known methods do not therefore allow the die presses to reach their maximum capacity for producing parts. The rate of production for the die presses is even slower using vibratory methods to induce more regular powder flow.<br>
Moreover, in some instances there is an additional loss of time involved in shuttling the feed shoe back and forth from the die cavity to a retracted position in order to avoid the upper punch of the die press during the press cycle or "stroke." The stroke time is also lengthened by the requirement to allow sufficient time to raise the upper punch high enough to allow the-feed shoe to pass thereunder en route to a retracted position.<br>
In the aforementioned and other known methods and feed shoes for delivering particulate material to a die cavity, the step of retracting the feed shoe by dragging the feed shoe over the upper surface of the wear plate of the die table has been necessary to cut off, the flow of particulate materials from the feed shoe. This retraction of the feed shoe after filling the die cavity results, however, in the buildup of powders in the die near the trailing edge of the feed shoe. This friction-induced "wedging" effect further exacerbates the problem of obtaining parts and articles having non-uniform density upon compacting the particulate material in the die cavity, with all of the accompanying aforementioned disadvantages.<br>
The present invention solves these aforementioned and other problems by providing a powder feeding system and powder delivery method that uses pressure or air to feed powder into a die cavity, thereby avoiding the problems inherent in gravity feed systems. Using pressure or air in the present powder feeding system and delivery method pushes a mass of powder well into the die cavity at a relatively rapid rate and subsequent pulsing serves to level the powder within the cavity.<br>
The present invention further provides for a method and accompanying suitable apparatus for evenly and uniformly distributing particulate material throughout all regions of a die cavity by operating to fluidize the particulate material once it is situated inside the cavity. The resultant uniformity in material distribution throughout all regions of the die cavity is both in. quantity and in density. . Moreover, fluidization of the powder within the die cavity prior to compaction on the die press allows uniform filling of dies including those having complex geometries and those for producing multilevel parts. Additionally, such fluidization of the particulate material can also be used to thoroughly mix powders of different materials (and densities) to create a homogeneous mixture of powders in the die.<br>
It should be understood that the use of the terms "powders" and "particulate" or "particulate material" are interchangeable for purposes of the description herein and should be construed to include any material that is particulate in nature and should not be limited solely to powdered metals.<br>
 The present invention alec solves the problem of delivering a constant quantity by weight of particulate material to the die cavity from press cycle to press cycle<br>
(pressed part to pressed part) by providing a gravimetric feeding system and a method for delivering particulate material. For purposes of this invention "predetermined" is used to designate that weight of powder which is to be delivered to the die cavity of a powder press in order to produce a. part of a given desired weight. It should be understood that such weight will vary accordingly from application to application (part to part) and therefore for purposes of this invention cannot be definitively quantified.<br>
Hence,  complex part  shapes . and parts  having  tight .dimensional tolerances .such as helical gears and -sprockets<br>
t<br>
heretofore unavailable using known powder delivery methods can be made in the die cavity of a powder press by using the present powder delivery methods and apparatus  In addition to providing such "as pressed" dimensional tolerances, the present invention provides an expanded applicability to part •designs -for .powder .metallurgy, better part yields as a result of fewer cracks in green compacts and sintered parts, faster set up times, and faster production rates.<br>
The present invention also optionally allows for a shuttleless feeding system and method for powder delivery. Since particulate material is delivered directly to the die cavity using pressure or air there is no loss of time associated with extending and retracting a feed shoe vessel for delivering (shuttling) powders to the die cavity of a powder press. The absence of a shuttle, also eliminates any wedging of powders- caused by dragging known feed shoe yessels back over the die cavity to sit in a retracted position. As a further advantage, the present invention can optionally be used as a completely closed .system and thus also reduces or eliminates powder waste and environmental hazards from powders lost around die cavities using traditional feeding methods and<br>
apparatuses. Additionally, since moving shuttle parts are not required, there can be less overall parts to break or wear out thereby lowering costs. The safety issue of having a possible obstruction to the upper punch is also eliminated.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
In its most basic embodiment, the present invention is directed to a method and accompanying apparatus for using pressure or air to push a mass of powder from behind into to a die cavity of a powder press and subsequently fluidizing the powder in the die cavity to provide for a substantially uniform density distribution of powder, within the die cavity. Such fluidization can be carried out independent of the pressurized delivery. In other words, powder or particulate material that .has been delivered to the die cavity of a powder press (or any other apparatus for making parts .or .components using particulate material) using conventional methods can also benefit from subsequent fluidization once inside the cavity using the present invention.<br>
Referring now to the embodiment illustrated in Fig. 1, the salient features of a gravimetric pulsed feed powder delivery system are shown. The feeding system as shown relates to the feeding and delivery of a precise amount of powdered metals into a die cavity. The powdered metals (not shown) are uniformly delivered using pressure from behind to push a mass of powder into all regions of die cavity 5 and arc to be compacted by the simultaneous application of upper die punch 7 and lower die punch 11. Metal powders are being used only and the teachings of this<br>
invention, should not therefore be construed as being limited to handling of metal powders, but are equally applicable to<br>
the handling and delivery of particulate materials of various weights and types including without limitation, for example, flakes, powders, fibers or sheets of ceramics, polymers, carbides and cements (cementatious materials blended with water).<br>
The present invention can push 500 grams of powder into a die in as little as three seconds or less. The overall cycle time for producing a part is consequently reduced from around 10 seconds using conventional powder feed methods to 4 seconds or less using the present methods and system. Concentricity and height and weight tolerances of such parts are also greatly increased.<br>
Specifically, the invention as shown is directed to a powder feed system .for . delivering a quantity of particulate material to a die cavity of a powder press, .such as the powder feed system exemplified by Figure 1, reference to which is now made. -The powder press includes platen 1 having table-like surface 2 which is flush with and surrounds die cavity 5. The press additionally includes upper punch 7, which appends from upper ram 9 and lower punch 11. The powder delivery system as shown is Figure 1 comprises receptacle 13, shown here as annular in shape, for receiving and delivering particulate material to die cavity 5. Receptacle 13 is connected to die surface 22 by any suitable connector, such as those illustrated as bolts 4 which extend through receptacle holes 24 and then through threaded holes 6 in die surface 22. Receptacle 13 has ingress 15 through which a mass of particulate material is received under pressure and egress 17 that registers and communicates with interior 19 of cavity 5 ctnJ through which particulate material is pushed under pressure from feed conduit 21 through interior void 16 into<br>
cavity 5.  Feed conduit 21 is sealingly attached at first end 23 to receptacle ingress 15.<br>
In Figure 1, the pressurized powder feed system according to the present invention is shown to have annular shaped receptacle 13 and comprises an annular receptacle body 14 that surrounds and defines interior void 16. Receptacle body 14 has top side 18 and bottom side 20 and is sealingly attached at bottom side 20 to die surface 22, die surface 22 being contiguous with table-like surface 2 of platen 1 so that annular receptacle body 14 surrounds upper rim 3 of die cavity 5 and interior void 16 is contiguous with cavity 5. :Exhaust portal 35 extends through receptacle body 14 for .releasing pressure from within interior 19 of die cavity 5.<br>
.Figures 2a.and.2b illustrate an alternative .embodiment of . the ^present .pressurized-powder .feed- system- wherein receptacle<br>
113	-is annular in shape and comprises annular receptacle "body<br>
114	:that -surrounds and defines interior void. 116.-through which<br>
upper punch 107 passes.   Exhaust portal 135 extends through<br>
receptacle body 114.  Receptacle body 114 has bottom surface<br>
120 for sealingly engaging die surface 122 surrounded by<br>
platen 101 (shown in engaged position in Figure 2a) and top<br>
surface 118 at which it is movingly attached to and suspended<br>
from upper ram 109 by spring-like suspenders 143 through which<br>
pass anchoring posts 146 which are secured at first end 145 to<br>
receptacle body 114 and which slidably extend at second end<br>
144 into recesses 145 of upper ram 109.  In operation, upper<br>
ram 109 moves downwardly,  lowering . annular-like receptacle<br>
body  114  to  a  position whereby bottom  surface  120  of<br>
receptacle body 114 engages top surface 122 of die cavity 105.<br>
Upper ram. 109 continues in a downward fashion lowering upper<br>
punch 107 through interior void 116, thereby sealing interior<br>
void 116 before continuing down into die cavity 105 and<br>
pressing particulate material (pushed into to die cavity 105 through feed conduit 121) against lower punch 111.<br>
In an alternative embodiment, although not specifically illustrated herein, the receptacle body can form part of the die and sit "in" the cavity whereby the top of the receptacle body is flush with the surface of the platen.   In such an embodiment, the powder feed system according to the present invention comprises an annular (or other suitable shaped) receptacle body that surrounds and defines the die cavity. The receptacle body has a top and a bottom side and is situated so |that the top side of the receptacle body is flush with  the  table-like  surface  of  the  platen.  Such  a configuration is useful. in 'situations where the powder press ejects parts .by lowering the platen relative to a .-stationary lower :punch to push the part up and out from the die cavity. As  can be envisioned by one of skill  in the  art,  in  cembodiments of  the present  invention .wherein  the feeding receptacle is bolted to the top of the platen, parts may become entrapped within the interior void of the receptacle upon ejection.<br>
In all of the aforementioned embodiments, it is to be understood that the "annular" shape of the receptacle is for exemplary purposes only and that the receptacle can be any shape that appropriately surrounds the die cavity and that has an interior that defines the shape of the die cavity by more or less following the shape of the rim of the cavity. Hence, the present invention should not be construed to be limited to annular-shaped receptacles.<br>
In specific instances, the receptacle can be the upper punch or the lower punch of the die press- Such a configuration is especially well suited to situations where very small parts are being fabricated. In such instances the<br>
punch integrity is not diminished or compromised by the loss of punch mass necessary to convert it into a receptacle through which powder is delivered.<br>
In yet another alternative embodiment (not shown) , the receptacle is box-like in shape and the ingress is a top ingress and the egress is a bottom egress. The box-like receptacle is optionally organized to cooperate with a shuttle such as pneumatic piston/cylinder or mechanical linkage for selectively reciprocating the receptacle along a horizontal plane elevated above and transverse to a position whereby its bottom egress overhangs the die cavity and for downwardly moving the receptacle to register its bottom opening with the die cavity. The powder in the receptacle is then pushed into the die cavity using pressure or air. The box-like&gt;receptacle is then .shuttled away to allow for the upper punch to lower into.the die cavity and press the part.<br>
Referring now to Figure 3, -the present -invention is further illustrated wherein at least one pressure generator 225 is sealingly attached to and openly communicating with top end 227 of pressure vessel 229. Pressure vessel 229 is attached at its bottom end 226 to second end 231 of feed conduit 221. Pressure generator 225 is for providing supra atmospheric pressure to push particulate material from vessel 229 through feed conduit 221 into die cavity 205 and for optionally fluidizing particulate material 233 within die cavity 205 to create a substantially uniform density distribution of the paiLi-culate material 233 wi-thin cavity 205. Feed conduit 221 is preferably made from a material which does not generate static electricity. The present inventors have found that a tube of conductive teflon material with graphite flakes dispersed therein situated inside of a stainless steel sleeve for grounding purposes to be useful.<br>
However, any non-static material is suitable for use as the feed conduit. A least one exhaust portal 235 extends through receptacle body 214 for releasing pressure from within die cavity 205. Receptacle body 214 is shown here to surround and define interior void 216 Receptacle body 214 has top side 218 and bottom side 220 and is sealingly .attached at bottom side 220 to die surface 222 surrounded by platen 201 so that annular receptacle body 214 surrounds upper rim 203 of die cavity 205 and interior void 216 is contiguous with cavity 205.<br>
At least one. exhaust portal is provided at any suitable<br>
point in the powder delivery system of the present invention. For example, as shown  in Figure 3, at least one:exhaust portal 235 can be  situated, on. receptacle 213  wherein it .extends through  receptacle body 214, or alternatively, at least one exhaust portal can  be  situated  on  pressure vessel 229 or  on  both. Exhaust  portal .235 -allows for the release of pressure from within die cavity 205 as pressure is used to push the powder into the cavity 205 and can also be used in conjunction with pulses of pressure to fluidize the powders within die cavity 205. Exhaust portal 235 is further equipped with a valve 236, such as a poppit valve, for opening and closing to relieve pressure within die cavity 205.<br>
Referring now to Figure 4, exhaust portal 335 is additionally optionally equipped with screen 337 situated at its proximal side to prevent the escape of powders from die cavity 305 through portal 335 during pressure delivery through the powder delivery conduit (not shown) into die cavity 305. Exhaust portal 335 is optionally further equipped at its disterl end with an auxiliary pressure generator (net shown) for pushing powders off of screen 337 to clean it. A third optional conduit, auxiliary conduit 338 is provided in<br>
receptacle 313 to deliver any number of useful additive substances to the interior of die cavity 305. Such additives include, for example, solvents, reactants die wall lubricants, activation solutions (dilute acids for cold welding of powders) , and any other of a number of substances useful in the production of parts and components using a powder precs.<br>
As described, the aforementioned feeding system may be gravimetric and thus optionally further comprise a scale (or scales for multiple weighing) juxtaposed between the feed system receptacle and a source of particulate material. The scale is used tp weigh the quantity of particulate material before it is delivered to the die cavity. The present gravimetric delivery method and feeding  system is capable of providing an individual shot of powder, up to about 3000 or more grams to be pre weighed to an .accuracy of within-about 0.1 grams. The powder shot is optionally weighed and pushed from .behind  under  pressure into a die cavity, and fluidized once inside the die cavity (caused to behave fluid-like in nature), thereby uniformly filling all regions in the cavity to uniform density.<br>
Referring now to Figure 5, a scale according to the present invention is comprised of scale vessel 460 for receiving a quantity of particulate material (not shown) from lower end 462 of hopper 464. Scale vessel 460 is receptive of the quantity of particulate material. Scale vessel 460 has at least one bottom egress opening 466 for releasing the particulate material into pressure vessel 429. Scale vessel 460 has upper edge 468 with at least two support points 470 situated thereon. Elongated support beams 472 suspend from and attach at proximal and 475 to each of said at least two support points 470 and attached at its distal end 476 to crossbar 478. Crossbar 478 rests upon load cell 479. Load<br>
cell 479 has a signal sender (not shown) for sending signals to a controller (not shown) for opening and closing valve 480 associated with discharge opening 462 of hopper 464. Pressure vessel 429 has valve 482 associated therewith for preventing the escape of pressure therefrom when pressure vessel 429 is receptive of pressure provided by pressure generator 425. Pressure vessel 429 is supported above and offset from load cell 479 by bridging member 484. Bridging member 484 is comprised of horizontal bridge support 485 and vertical bridge supports 486, each of which straddles load cell 479. Pressure vessel 429 is suspended above horizontal bridge support 485 by vessel suspenders 487. Pressure generator 425 is for generating supra-atmospheric pressures within vessel 429, feed conduit 421 and die cavity 405 and is connected to pressure vessel 429 via pressure duct 488 and to an electronic controller (not . shown) responsible for starting and "stopping the delivery of pressure to vessel 429.<br>
It is important to note that the weighing system according to the present invention acts independently of the pressure delivery system and accordingly does not provide an overall time disadvantage to the system. Hence, appropriate amounts of powdered materials are weighed during the press cycle and are therefore immediately ready to be utilized once the contents of the pressurized feed system receptacle is delivered to the die cavity.<br>
As further shown in Figure 5, the pressurized feed system generally comprises feed system receptacle body 414 through which a quantity of particulate material (not shown) is pushed into die cavity 405 and powder feed conduit 421 for communicating with receptacle body 414. Additionally, several pressure systems can be used in concert to deliver different materials such as copper aluminum to make a heat sink with a<br>
copper aluminum base for low coefficient of thermal conductivity or a multiplicity of alloys of different compositions to make functionally graded alloys.<br>
In operation, feed receptacle body 414 is situated so that interior void 416 registers with and is contiguous with die cavity 405. Upper punch 407 is lowered to a position whereby it engages the inner periphery 408 of receptacle body 414 and seals die cavity 405 from the outside atmosphere allowing for pressurizing of the system. Hopper valve 454 opens and allows particulate material from hopper 464 to flow ir^to scale vessel 460 having closed (flapper) valve 467. When load cell 479 registers the weight of the particulate material inside scale vessel 460 as about one half that of a predetermined weight, a signal is sent from load.cell 479 to partially close hopper valve 454 thereby slowing the rate of flow of• particulate material from hopper 464 into scale vessel 460. When load cell 479 registers the weight of the particulate material inside scale vessel 460 as the predetermined weight, valve 454 completely closes thereby stopping the flow of particulate material from hopper 464 into scale vessel 460. Valve 467 opens to release the particulate material into pressure vessel 429. Valve 482 closes and pressure generator 425 generates pressure within pressure vessel 429, thereby pushing the particulate material through powder feed conduit 421 into interior void 416 of receptacle body 414 and into die cavity 405. Pressure is exhausted through exhaust portal 435 (or through auxiliary exhaust portal not shown) either simultaneously with pressure generated pushing of particulate material or shortly thereafter. Pressure generated is subsequently exhausted in a series of at least one pulse to fluidize the particulate material within die cavity 405 and evenly distribute the<br>
powder to uniform density within all regions of die cavity 405. Upper punch 407 continues in a downward motion and the particulate material is compressed within die cavity 405 to produce a part (not shown) . The cycle is repeated for each part to be produced.<br>
The step of fluidizing, for purposes of the present<br>
•<br>
invention, serves to level the powder inside the die cavity so that it has a uniform density throughout the die cavity. This step of fluidizing the powder can be done independently of the pressurized powder delivery and thus can be used in traditional powder feed methods and feed shoes wherein a<br>
shuttle simply drops powder into a die cavity. For pxirposes of the present invention, fluidization can be carried out by any number . of . methods and can include, but should not be construed as. limited to, pressurizing and exhausting the die cavity, agitating the filled cavity by vibration (ultrasonic, sonic, shock, electric field or magnetic pulses, etc.) or by adding the powder blended with a liquid component to the die cavity. Such liquid could be subsequently removed by evaporation, suction or forced out by pressure.<br>
The present invention is further directed to a method for creating uniform density distribution of a quantity of particulate material situated within a die cavity of a powder press. The method comprises delivering a quantity of particulate material to the die cavity and fluidizing the particulate material within the die cavity to evenly distribute the particulate material so .. that it is substantially uniform in density throughout the die cavity. Preferably the fluidizing step comprises sealing the die cavity from the atmosphere and thereafter applying a series of<br>
at least one pressure pulse into the interior of the die cavity. The series of pressure pulses comprises from about 2<br>
to about 100 pressure pulses, each of which comprises delivering supra-atmospheric pressure into the sealed die cavity and thereafter exhausting the pressure from within the die cavity. Preferably each of the pressure pulses comprise delivering pressure to the die cavity in the amount of about 1 pound per square inch ("psi") to about 150 psi, for a time period of about 10x seconds and exhausting the pressure at least one time for a time period of from about x seconds. Typically, such pressure pulses comprises delivering pressure to the die cavity in the amount of about 1 psi to about 150<br>
psi, for a time period of from about .01 seconds to about 60<br>
seconds and exhausting the pressure at least one time for a time period of from about .01 seconds to about 60 seconds.<br>
In a particularly preferred method .the.series of pressure pulses comprises from about 2 to about 100 pressure pulses. Each of. the pressure pulses comprises delivering pressure to the.die cavity in the amount of from about 1 psi to about 150 psi, for a time period of from about .01 seconds to about 60 seconds and exhausting the pressure at least one time for a time period of from about .01 seconds to about 60 seconds.<br>
In the method according to the present invention, supra-atmospheric pressure is optionally applied simultaneously with the powder delivery step to push the particulate material into the die cavity. In such instances, the pressure applied during powder delivery is from about 1 psi to about 150 psi, and is applied for a time period of from about .01 seconds to about 60 seconds. In methods according to the present invention wherein pressure is also used to push the particulate material into the die cavity, the fluidizing step can alternatively comprise exhausting the pressure used to push the particulate material into the die cavity from the die cavity in a series of at least one pulsed exhaust. The series<br>
preferably comprises from about 2 to about 100 pulsed exhausts and each of the pulsed exhausts should preferably last from about .01 seconds to about 60 seconds.<br>
In general, suitable specific pressures for generating within the die cavity when using the present method and powder feed  system are  readily optimizable  and  should not  be construed to be limited only to those- ranges specifically taught  hereinabove.   These pressures will generally vary depending on the size and complexity of the die cavity, and the degree of difficulty in uniformly filling the die cavity. Likewise,  suitable  time  duration  for  pressurizing  (and exhausting) are also readily optimizable by one of skill in the art.  .The. aforementioned optimization is also applicable for. creating, an appropriate pattern, of .pulses . for delivering and exhausting pressure to create a fluidized bed of powders within the die cavity and thereby resulting in uniform density distribution of powders therein prior to powder compression or for homogeneously mixing different powders (optionally having different respective densities) within the die cavity. The step of fluidizing the powder within the die cavity should not however be limited to generating and exhausting pressure within the cavity and should be construed to include other means for causing the particulate material within the die cavity to behave like a fluid and thus distribute to uniform density throughout the die cavity.   Such other means can include, but are not limited to methods for agitating the filled die such as creating an electric field, ultrasonicc and sonic vibration,  mechanical vibration,  magnetic field and combinations thereof.  Alternatively, the step of fluidization can be carried out by • blending the -powder with a suitable, liquid that would subsequently be removed by evaporation or by being forced or vacuumed out of the die.   Uniform powder<br>
distribution within the die cavity can alternatively be accomplished by providing the powder to the die cavity in shrink wrapped sacks that are tightly stretched around the powder materials. Such sacks would also act to level the materials in the die upon compaction.<br>
As in the powder feed system described hereinabove, particulate material suitable for use in the present method can be any known or as of yet unknown particulate, (e.g. particles, flakes, fibers or mixtures thereof) material used to fabricate parts or components. Examples of such suitable materials include, but should not be limited to metal powders, non-met&amp;I powders, intermetallic powders and composite powders.<br>
The present invention method optionally comprises weighing the particulate material before delivering it to the interior of the die cavity. Such a method comprises providing a quantity of particulate material and allowing the particulate material to flow at a first rate into a weighing receptacle resting on a scale for registering the weight of the particulate material. The flow rate is reduced to a second rate when the scale registers a weight that is from about one quarter to about three quarters that of the predetermined weight, and preferably about one half that of the predetermined weight. The flow of particulate material is stopped when the scale registers the constant weight. The constant weight of particulate material is then delivered to a feeding receptacle that registers with the die cavity. The top of the die cavity is sealed with the upper punch. Simultaneously with the delivering step, pressure is generated within the pressure vessel and into the  feeding receptacle to push the mass of particulate material from behind into the die cavity. Because pressure is generated and applied from<br>
behind, the particulate material travels in front of the pressurized air as a whole mass of material. Preferably, the quantity of particulate material is provided in a hopper having a valve associated with a lower portion thereof. The valve is opened to allow the particulate material to flow at a rate from the hopper into a weighing receptacle resting on a scale for registering the weight of the particulate material. The valve is partially closed when the scale registers a weight that is from about one quarter to about three quarters that of the constant weight and most preferably when the weight is about one half that of the constant weight. The<br>
valve is completely closed when the load cell registers the constant weight.<br>
This method can, of course, also optionally include the step of fluidizing the particulate material within the die cavity to distribute the particulate material to uniform density throughout the die cavity. Such step of fluidization can be carried out using any of those methods described hereinabove.<br>
As noted, the method according to the present invention is especially well suited to produce parts having complex shape and tight dimensional tolerances by powder metallurgy. In these methods the die . cavity is provided in a shape corresponding to that of the part. Exemplary parts that can made using the present invention include but should not be limited to a watch bezel, a sprocket, a helical gear, a worm gear, a staLox -core, heat sinking-, structures, -automobile connecting rods and an armature for an electrical motor.<br>
Powder feed systems and methods according to the present invention can be- adapted for use in any  known powder press manufacturing process and can also be temperature controlled as appropriate by, for example, insulation, heating with<br>
convection or induction, microwave systems or heat transfer methods that pump oil or hot water through pipes or coils. The feed systems and methods described can also be used in multiple feed situations.<br>
In yet a further embodiment, the present invention is directed to a powder press for making parts from particulate materials. The powder press according to the present invention comprises the above-described powder feed system for delivering particulate materials to a die cavity and a wear plate defining a die table of the powder press. In those embodiments of the present invention involving a shuttle, the shuttle of the feed system receptacle is mounted on its underside to an upper surface of the wear plate. In those embodiments that . are shuttleless, an annular feed ring is attached to the upper surface of the die table or set inside and is flush with and surrounds the die cavity. Alternatively, the annular ring floats with and is suspended around the upper punch of the powder press.<br>
The invention will now be described more specifically with reference to the following non-limiting examples thereof.<br>
Examples<br>
Example 1<br>
A series of thirty, 500 gram sprocket parts having a shape similar to that shown in Figure 6 with a target height of 1.5 inches and a target diameter of 2.7 inches are produced using the present invention in accordance with the following:<br>
Steel powder (Hoeganas 1000B blended with carbon) is fed through a pinch valve (Red Valve Series 2600, 1" diameter) controlled by an electronic regulator (Norgren Electronic Regulator) at a rate of approximately 250 grams/second onto a scale which rests en a load cell (Tedea Huntleigh Loadcell Model #9010) , when the load cell registers approximately 250<br>
grams the electronic regulator causes the pinch valve to be choked down to slow the feed of the powder onto the load cell. The pinch valve is completely shut off when the target weight (500 grams) has been registered on the load cell. The load cell is connected to the electronic regulator which is itself controlled by an analog signal. The powder initially falls through the pinch valve into a scale funnel having a closed flapper valve controlled with an electromagnetic solenoid valve (Dormeyer Industries B24253-A-7) . The scale funnel is attached to the load cell. The load cell controller is programmed with target 500 grams per part weight as well as a slow feed and a dribble weight. The solenoid valve opens causing the flapper valve to open and weighed powder comes out and the flapper valve shuts. Powder falls into a pressure vessel having a pinch valve on top to open and close the vessel. The pinch valve closes sealing the ingress to the pressure vessel. The egress of the pressure vessel is connected to a feed tube (carbon/teflon composite with stainless sheathing SC8-608-608-66) . The feed tube is attached at its distal end to an annular ring shaped feed system receptacle through a powder delivery conduit attached thereon. Pressurized air is provided to the pressure vessel by a pressure generator regulated by a regulator (Norgren Electronic Pressure Regulator R26-200-RMLA) through a prefilter capable of filtering out water and substances down to 5 microns in size, and then through a coalescing filter capable " of removing subscances down . to a single mior-on in size. Air comes up to the electronic regulator (Norgren Air Pressure Regulator 11-018-110 with Dial PSI indicator) ouatrolled by an ana-log signal. Air is exhausted through a filter and out through a poppit valve (Norgren 3-way Poppit Valve D1023H-CC1WA) . At the time of filling, the electronic<br>
regulator is programmed with the appropriate amount of pressure which is controlled by a controller (Norgren Air Pressure Regulator 11-018-110 w/Dial PSI indicator). The upper punch of the powder press lowers to seal the top of the annular ring feed system receptacle, effectively sealing the system and the controller opens and shuts the poppit valves allowing air into the feed conduit and exhausting it out of the feed ring. The powder sits at the bottom of the pressure vessel and the poppit valve that lets air into the pressure vessel opens and pushes the powder through the feed tube into the feed system annular receptacle and ultimately into the die cavity. The poppit valve is in the off position on the exhaust portal of the annular feed system receptacle allowing for the exhaust of air from the die cavity. This exhaust portal is covered by a screen that is cleaned by forcing air through it in the direction opposite to that which the air is exhausted. The regulator drops the pressure in the pressure generator to the fluidization pressure and the powder in the die is subsequently fluidized by the rapid delivery and exhaust of pressure into and out of the die cavity. The relevant process parameters for this procedure are as follows:<br>
Process:<br>
Feed Powder into die cavity- 3 pulses of 1 second at 55 PSI and exhaust for .09 seconds.<br>
Fluidize-8 pulses of .1 second at 10 PSI and exhaust for .09 seconds.<br>
0.37" interior diameter feed tube<br>
After powder is delivered to the die cavity, the powder is pressed between the upper and lower punches of the powder prcsc to a density of 6.9 g/cc on a 220 ton Cincinatti press to make a sprocket having the following required part tolerances:<br>
weight: +/-0.6 grams (+/-3 sigma) height: +/-0.0009 inches (+/-3 sigma) concentricity: +/-0.0009 inches (+/-3 sigma) concentricity tolerance of tool is +/-0.006 The concentricity, height and weight measurements are taken of the thirty (30) parts so produced (concentricity is measured using a Mitotoyo BenchCenter) and the results are reported in Table 1:<br>
