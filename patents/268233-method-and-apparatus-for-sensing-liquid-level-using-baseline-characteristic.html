METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR SENSING LIQUID LEVEL USING BASELINE<br>
CHARACTERISTIC<br>
BACKGROUND OF INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of Invention<br>
This invention relates to methods and apparatus for liquid level sensing.<br>
2.	Related Art<br>
Level sensing in a tank, such as a tank for storing, heating and/or metering water in a<br>
coffee brewing machine, may be important for several reasons, such as for advising a user<br>
that the tank needs to be refilled, for determining a volume present in the tank, and/or<br>
preventing operation of the machine without sufficient water being present in the tank. Level<br>
sensing in such applications may be done in different ways. In one approach, a conductive<br>
probe may be used to detect the presence of the water in the tank by determining whether the<br>
resistance of a circuit including the probe drops below an absolute threshold, e.g., below 3000<br>
ohms indicating the presence of relatively low resistance water in the circuit.<br>
SUMMARY OF INVENTION<br>
The inventors have appreciated that the use of some prior probe detection<br>
arrangements may not work as desired in some conditions. For example, in some<br>
applications with highly filtered water, such as reverse osmosis deionized (RODI) filtered<br>
water, it may be difficult to detect the water level because of the relatively high resistance of<br>
the filtered water. For example, some detection arrangements measure the resistance of a<br>
normally open circuit between a conductive probe and the tank wall, which circuit typically<br>
has a relatively high resistance when air is present between the probe and the tank. When<br>
highly conductive water is used, the resistance of the circuit drops substantially when water is<br>
present in the circuit between the probe and the tank. However, with some types of highly<br>
filtered water, the resistance of the water may be relatively high, preventing some systems<br>
from detecting the presence of the water between the probe and the tank.<br>
Another problem encountered with some systems is scale or other deposits that may<br>
be present on the probe, tank walls and/or other portions of the sensing circuit. Such deposits<br>
may be relatively common in systems where water is heated in the tank, e.g., for brewing<br>
purposes. Scale and other deposits may cause the probe circuit resistance to vary over time,<br><br>
WO 2007/002556	PCT/US2006/024737<br>
-2-<br>
e.g., over the course of 100 or more tank fill/heat/dispense cycles, as well as cause the probe<br>
circuit resistance to vary over the course of a single fill operation. For example, when a tank<br>
is new or relatively free of deposits, the resistance of the probe circuit may be relatively high<br>
with no water present at the probe. Over the course of many tank fill/heat/dispense cycles,<br>
scale buildup in the tank may cause the resistance of the probe circuit to drop from what it<br>
was when the tank was new. Also, when a tank is new, the resistance of the probe circuit<br>
generally will not change much when the tank walls are hot and the tank is refilling.<br>
However, when scale is present on the tank walls and/or the probe, the scale may contain a<br>
certain amount of water immediately after the tank is drained. If the tank walls are hot, the<br>
water held by the scale may tend to evaporate, e.g., as the tank is being filled, causing the<br>
resistance of the probe circuit to increase. As a result, the performance of the level sensing<br>
arrangement may change in relatively unpredictable ways over the life of the system and<br>
cause certain systems to be unable to reliably detect the water level in a tank,<br>
In one aspect of the invention, a method for determining a level of a liquid in a tank<br>
includes providing a tank in which a liquid level is variable, and measuring a baseline<br>
characteristic of a probe circuit including a probe associated with the tank while the probe is<br>
out of contact with the liquid in the tank. The baseline characteristic may be a voltage,<br>
resistance or other characteristic of a circuit including the probe. The baseline characteristic<br>
may be measured when the probe is known to be out of contact with liquid in the tank, such<br>
as soon after the tank has been drained below the probe level. A first characteristic of the<br>
probe circuit may be measured after measuring the baseline characteristic, e.g., while the tank<br>
is being filled. Based on the baseline characteristic, the liquid level in the tank may be<br>
determined for a time corresponding to about when the first characteristic is measured. For<br>
example, the first characteristic may be compared to the baseline characteristic, and based on<br>
the comparison it may be determined whether the liquid level is below the probe, or at or<br>
above the probe. In one embodiment, a difference between the first characteristic and the<br>
baseline characteristic may be determined, and if the difference exceeds a threshold, it may<br>
be determined that the liquid is at or above the probe level.<br>
By using a measured baseline characteristic, the liquid level determining approach<br>
may be capable of more reliably detecting the presence of the liquid at the probe, even when<br>
highly filtered water is used and/or scale or other deposits are present at the tank, probe or<br>
other portions of the probe circuit. Measuring the baseline characteristic (e.g., during the<br><br>
WO 2007/002556	 PCT/US2006/024737<br>
-3-<br>
tank fill operation) can enable the system to determine the resistance or other characteristic of<br>
the probe circuit in a known condition (when the probe is out of contact with the liquid), and<br>
use that characteristic to compare to later measured characteristics. Thus, if scale or other<br>
deposits are present that alter the resistance or other characteristic of the probe circuit,<br>
measuring the baseline characteristic can effectively take the changes to the circuit caused by<br>
the scale or other deposits into account when determining the liquid level. Also, since the<br>
baseline characteristic can be accurately measured, relatively small changes in resistance that<br>
may occur when using highly filtered water or other high resistance liquid may be detected.<br>
In another aspect of the invention, a liquid level determining system may include a<br>
probe circuit including a conductive probe constructed and arranged to contact a liquid in a<br>
tank in which the liquid level is variable. A controller may be adapted to measure a baseline<br>
characteristic of the probe circuit while the conductive probe is out of contact with the liquid<br>
in the tank, measure a first characteristic of the probe circuit after measuring the baseline<br>
characteristic, and determine the liquid level in the tank for a time that corresponds to about<br>
when the first characteristic is measured.<br>
In one embodiment, the controller may measure the baseline characteristic repeatedly<br>
during a tank fill operation so that the baseline characteristic can be updated during the fill.<br>
For example, a baseline characteristic may be compared to the first characteristic and if a<br>
determination is made that the liquid is not at or above the probe, the value of the first<br>
characteristic may be assigned as the baseline characteristic used when subsequently<br>
determining the liquid level. Alternately, the baseline characteristic may be separately<br>
remeasured and reset. This process may be repeated throughout the fill operation until the<br>
liquid is determined to be at or above the probe, at which time the fill operation may be<br>
stopped.<br>
These and other aspects of the invention will be apparent from the following<br>
description and claims.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS<br>
Aspects of the invention are described below with reference to illustrative<br>
embodiments, wherein like elements reference like numerals, and wherein:<br>
Figure 1 shows a schematic view of a level sensing system in accordance with the<br>
invention that is incorporated into a beverage forming system; and<br><br>

Figure 2 shows steps in a method for determining a liquid level in a tank in<br>
accordance with the invention.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
Aspects of the invention may be practiced using any suitable arrangement for the<br>
probe sensor and/or any associated beverage forming system. Several different embodiments<br>
are described herein for purposes of illustration. However, these illustrative embodiments<br>
should not be used to narrowly interpret the scope of the invention. For example,<br>
embodiments are described below in which a single probe sensor is used to determine a liquid<br>
level in a tank. However, two or more probes may be used at multiple levels so that the<br>
system is capable of determining two or more liquid levels in the tank. In addition, various<br>
aspects of the invention are described herein, and these various aspects may be used in any<br>
suitable combination with each other, or alone.<br>
In one aspect of the invention, a liquid level sensing arrangement actually measures a<br>
baseline characteristic of a level sensing probe circuit, and uses the measured baseline<br>
characteristic to determine liquid level. This is in contrast to systems having a probe<br>
arrangement that detects a liquid level when a resistance of the probe circuit drops below a<br>
predetermined, absolute threshold. As discussed above, such systems can be inaccurate when<br>
detecting liquids having a high resistance and/or when there is scale or other deposits present<br>
on the tank, probe or other portions of the probe circuit. In one embodiment, the level<br>
sensing arrangement can update the baseline characteristic of the probe circuit two or more<br>
times during a single fill operation of the tank, thereby obtaining a more accurate baseline to<br>
compare to later measurements and determine a liquid level.<br>
In one aspect of the invention, the baseline characteristic may be a resistance or<br>
voltage of an electrical probe circuit, but other characteristics may be used, such as a<br>
capacitance, a value that represents a capacitance of the circuit (such as a circuit charge time),<br>
an impedance, an optical transmittance or other property (e.g., if the level sensing<br>
arrangement uses an optical detector to detect the liquid level), a pressure, and so on. Thus,<br>
aspects of the invention may be used with any suitable measuring/detecting technique, not<br>
just resistance/voltage-based approaches.<br>
Fig. 1 shows a schematic block diagram of a beverage forming system 1 incorporating<br>
a level sensing arrangement in accordance with aspects of the invention.   As discussed<br>
above, aspects of the invention may be used with any type of system, not just beverage<br><br>
WO 2007/002556	PCT/US2006/024737<br>
-5-<br>
forming systems. In this illustrative embodiment, the beverage forming system 1 includes a<br>
storage tank 2 that is adapted to store a quantity of water or other liquid used in forming a<br>
beverage. Water from the storage tank 2 may be supplied by a pump 3 to a metering tank 4.<br>
Water in the metering tank 4 may be heated by a heater 5, such as an electrical resistance<br>
heating element. Heated water may be discharged from the metering tank by an air pump 9<br>
that pressurizes the metering tank 4 and forces water from the tank 4 into a conduit 6 for flow<br>
to a brew chamber 7. The brew chamber 7 may operate in any suitable way to form a<br>
beverage from the water supplied by the conduit 6, such as contacting the water with a<br>
beverage medium (e.g., roasted and ground coffee) to form a beverage (e.g., a coffee<br>
beverage). The brew chamber 7 may be arranged to use a disposable beverage cartridge,<br>
such as a sealed container that includes the beverage medium and a filter element such that<br>
heated water may be injected into the container to infuse the beverage medium, and filtered<br>
beverage may be removed from the cartridge. Those of skill in the art will appreciate that<br>
other beverages may be formed, such as tea or other brewed or non-brewed beverages that<br>
include water soluable materials.<br>
Operation of the water pump 3, heater 5, air pump 9 and other portions of the system<br>
1 may be controlled by a controller 8. The controller 8 may include one or more general<br>
purpose computing devices, a memory, suitable software or other operating instructions, user<br>
input/output devices, communication busses or other links, sensors, switches, relays, triacs,<br>
and/or other components necessary to perform desired input/output or other functions. The<br>
level of the water in the tank 4 may be detected by the controller 8 via a probe 10, which may<br>
include a conductive member that is electrically insulated from the tank and positioned to<br>
contact liquid in the tank when the liquid is present at or above a particular level. For<br>
example, when liquid is discharged from the tank 4 by the air pump 9, the liquid level will be<br>
at a low level L that is approximately equal to a level at the bottom of the conduit 6 in the<br>
tank 4. (Completion of the discharge of liquid from the tank 4 may be detected by the<br>
controller 8 detecting a drop in pressure in the tank 4 via a pressure sensor 11. That is, when<br>
water is being forced from the tank 4 into the conduit 6 the pressure may be relatively high as<br>
compared to pressure in the tank 4 when the liquid is fully discharged and air is being forced<br>
from the tank 4 into the conduit 6. The pressure sensor 11, which may be placed at any<br>
suitable location, such as in the water supply line, in the tank 4, etc., may detect this drop in<br>
pressure signifying completion of the liquid discharge.) Thereafter, the controller 8 may<br><br>
WO 2007/002556	PCT/US2006/024737<br>
-6-<br>
control the water pump 3 to begin filling of the tank 4 to ready the system 1 for formation of<br>
another beverage.<br>
During filling of the tank 4, the controller 8 may monitor a characteristic of a circuit<br>
that includes the probe 10 to detect a change in the characteristic that indicates that the liquid<br>
level in the tank 4 has reached the probe 10, i.e., the level is at or above a high level H. For<br>
example, the controller 8 may monitor the probe circuit for a change in resistance and/or<br>
voltage that indicates that the liquid has contacted the probe 10. (In some embodiments,<br>
water is generally low in resistance, and thus a normally "open" circuit between the probe 10<br>
and the tank walls will have a high resistance until water completes a circuit between the<br>
probe 10 and the tank 4, dropping the resistance of the circuit. Even when RODI water is<br>
used in the system, a detectable change in resistance/voltage/capacitance may be detected in<br>
accordance with aspects of the invention.)<br>
In one embodiment, the controller 8 may apply a constant DC signal to the probe<br>
circuit and monitor the circuit for changes in voltage, e.g., every 8.3 milliseconds or so. The<br>
DC signal may be applied during a time when a low pressure is detected at the end of a tank<br>
discharge operation until the fill operation of the tank is stopped. Thereafter, the DC signal<br>
may be shut off, and restarted at the end of a next discharge of the tank. It should be<br>
understood that other signals may be applied to the probe circuit as desired, such as an AC<br>
signal, which may help to reduce scale and/or other deposits on the probe in some<br>
applications, especially if the probe remains powered for long periods. In addition, the<br>
controller 8 may have a "blind" period for the probe circuit such that the controller 8 does not<br>
use output from the probe circuit during a time period that starts when a tank fill operation is<br>
started. Thus, any splashing of liquid in the tank that may wet the probe during initial fill<br>
(and possibly cause a false level indication) may be ignored. Also, any suitable filtering of<br>
the signal provided from the probe circuit may be used, e.g., a filter that requires that a<br>
difference between the baseline characteristic and the measured characteristic remains above<br>
(or below) a threshold for a specified period of time, such as 1/3 second for detection of the<br>
liquid level. This type of filtering may help avoid detecting "false positives."<br>
In accordance with an aspect of the invention, the controller 8 may measure the<br>
resistance or some other characteristic of the probe circuit when the probe is in a known<br>
condition, e.g., when the probe is "dry" or known to be out of contact with the liquid in the<br>
tank 4. In one embodiment, the controller 8 may know that the probe 10 is out of contact<br><br>
WO 2007/002556	 PCT/US2006/024737<br>
-7-<br>
with the liquid in the tank 4 when the pressure sensor 11 detects the end of a discharge of<br>
liquid from the tank. At this time or thereafter, the controller 8 may measure the<br>
characteristic of the probe circuit and use the measured characteristic as a baseline<br>
characteristic for the probe circuit. This baseline may be used for the next fill operation<br>
and/or for several subsequent fill cycles. Alternately, the baseline may be updated for each<br>
fill operation. The baseline characteristic may be compared to other characteristic<br>
measurements while the tank is being filled, and based on the comparison, the controller 8<br>
may determine whether or not the liquid is at or above the probe level, e.g., at or above the<br>
high level H. For example, a baseline resistance measured by the controller 8 immediately<br>
before a fill operation is begun may be compared to subsequent resistance measurements of<br>
the probe circuit as filling of the tank is performed by the water pump 3.<br>
In one embodiment, a difference between the baseline characteristic and a measured<br>
characteristic may be determined, and based on the difference, the controller may determine<br>
whether the liquid is at or above the probe level. For example, the controller may detect a<br>
particular baseline voltage for the probe circuit, then later detect another voltage for the probe<br>
circuit. A difference between the baseline voltage and the later measured voltage may be<br>
compared to a threshold, and if the difference exceeds the threshold, the controller may<br>
determine that the liquid level is at the probe. If not, the controller may later measure the<br>
voltage of the circuit again, compare the voltage to the baseline, determine the level of the<br>
liquid, and so on until the liquid level is determined to be at the probe. By using a difference<br>
between the baseline and later measured characteristic, relatively small changes in the<br>
characteristic may be detected, such as small changes in probe circuit resistance caused by<br>
RODI water contacting the probe. In one embodiment, the controller 8 may detect the<br>
presence of water at the probe 10 when the difference between a baseline voltage and a<br>
measured voltage is about 362 millivolts or more.<br>
In one embodiment, the baseline characteristic may be updated or refreshed two or<br>
more times during a fill operation for the tank. For example, if the controller measures a<br>
baseline characteristic, then later measures the probe circuit characteristic and determines that<br>
the liquid level is below the probe, the controller may assign the value of the later measured<br>
characteristic as the baseline characteristic. The controller may repeat this process as suitable<br>
until the liquid level is determined to be at the probe. In one embodiment, only values that<br>
are higher (or lower) than the baseline characteristic may be used to refresh or update the<br><br>
WO 2007/002556	PCT/US2006/024737<br>
-8-<br>
baseline characteristic. This type of approach may be useful when the tank, probe or other<br>
portions of the probe circuit have scale or other deposits that affect the resistance or other<br>
characteristic of the circuit. As discussed above, some such deposits may cause the resistance<br>
of the probe circuit to change from one fill cycle to the next and/or during a single fill<br>
operation. By updating or refreshing the baseline characteristic during a fill operation, the<br>
controller may take changes in the probe circuit caused by scale, deposits or other factors into<br>
account (particularly those that affect the probe circuit characteristic during the fill operation)<br>
and be able to accurately detect the presence of the liquid at the probe. Such an approach<br>
may increase the signal to noise ratio, and thereby increase the accuracy of the sensing<br>
operation. Another feature that may provide additional accuracy in detection may be to<br>
measure the circuit characteristic for determining level change during a relatively short time<br>
span, e.g., to help avoid variations that may occur over larger time spans.<br>
In another embodiment, the system may be capable of determining the type of water<br>
or other liquid used in the system, and adjust the system operation accordingly. For example,<br>
the system may be able to determine whether RODI or standard tap water is being used in the<br>
system, and use a suitable threshold when determining a difference between the baseline<br>
characteristic and the measured characteristic. Thus, the threshold may be a variable one,<br>
that is adjusted based on the type of water or other liquid used.<br>
Fig. 2 shows a flow chart of steps in a method for determining a liquid level in a tank<br>
or other reservoir. In step S10, a baseline characteristic for a probe circuit may be measured.<br>
In arrangements using a conductive probe, a resistance, voltage, capacitance or other feature<br>
of an electrical circuit including the conductive probe may be measured. In other<br>
arrangements, another suitable characteristic used to detect the liquid level may be measured,<br>
such as an optical impedance or optical signal amplitude, a pressure, temperature, etc. The<br>
baseline characteristic may be measured when the probe is in a known state, such as when the<br>
probe is known to be out of contact with the liquid immediately or shortly after an amount of<br>
liquid has been discharged from a tank.<br>
In step S20, a first characteristic of the probe circuit may be measured after the<br>
baseline characteristic has been measured. For example, the first characteristic may be<br>
measured shortly after the baseline characteristic is measured after the start of a fill operation<br>
of a tank. In another embodiment, the first characteristic may be measured many<br>
fill/discharge cycles after the baseline characteristic has been measured, e.g., when the<br><br>
WO 2007/002556	PCT/US2006/024737<br>
-9-<br>
baseline characteristic is used for multiple fill operations for the tank. The first characteristic<br>
may be measured in the same way as the baseline characteristic. For example, if the probe<br>
circuit uses an optical detector to detect the presence/absence of a liquid between a light<br>
emitter and a detector, the emitter may be controlled to emit light at the same intensity,<br>
frequency, duration, etc. as when measuring the baseline characteristic.<br>
In step S30, a determination of the liquid level may be made based on the baseline<br>
characteristic. For example, a determination may be made whether the liquid is below the<br>
probe, or at or above the probe based on the baseline characteristic. In one embodiment, the<br>
first characteristic may be compared to the baseline characteristic, and based on the<br>
comparison, the liquid level determination may be made. In this case, the determination of<br>
the liquid level will correspond to a time at or about the time that the first characteristic was<br>
measured. A difference between the baseline characteristic and the first characteristic may be<br>
determined, and the liquid level determined based on the difference value. For example, if<br>
the baseline characteristic is a resistance, if the difference in resistance between the baseline<br>
characteristic and the first characteristic exceeds a threshold, a determination may be made<br>
that the liquid is at or above the probe. By setting the threshold to a suitable value, an<br>
accurate determination of the liquid level may be made, even when the sensing arrangement<br>
is used with relatively high resistance liquids, such as RODI water.<br>
In one embodiment, if the comparison of the first characteristic and the baseline<br>
characteristic does not determine that the liquid is at or above the probe, a value of the first<br>
characteristic may be assigned to the baseline characteristic. Thus, the system may update<br>
the baseline characteristic each time the probe circuit characteristic is measured, and in some<br>
cases may do so multiple times during a fill operation of a tank or other reservoir. As<br>
discussed above, updating the baseline characteristic may be useful in some applications, e.g.,<br>
where the probe circuit resistance changes during the fill operation due to drying of scale or<br>
other deposits that affect the probe circuit. Thereafter, a second characteristic may be<br>
measured after the first characteristic was measured, and the second characteristic may be<br>

A liquid level sensing arrangement using a probe uses a baseline probe circuit characteristic, e.g., a circuit resistance or voltage, that is measured when the probe is out of contact with the liquid in the tank. The baseline characteristic may be used to determine a liquid level in the tank, e.g., a determination whether the liquid level is below or at/above the probe. In one embodiment, the baseline characteristic may be compared to a circuit characteristic that is measured as the tank is being filled. A difference between the baseline characteristic and the other circuit characteristic may be used to determine whether or not the probe is in contact with the liquid.<br></td>
