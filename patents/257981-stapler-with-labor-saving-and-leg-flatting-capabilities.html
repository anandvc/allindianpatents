				<td>STAPLER WITH LABOR-SAVING AND LEG-FLATTING<br>
CAPABILITIES<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE TNVENTTON<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a stapler, and more particularly to a stapler that has labor-saving and leg-flatting capabilities and can stably hold a maximum number of pages of documents together.<br>
2.	Description of Related Art<br>
A conventional stapler may comprise a mechanism to provide a labor-saving capability with a lever system or a leg-flatting device to clinch legs of a staple to keep a person from being injured by bent staple legs. However, the conventional stapler does not have a combination between a labor-saving mechanism and a leg-flatting device, so the operations of these two devices are not harmonized and the number of pages of documents held by a conventional stapler is limited. For example, a conventional stapler can only hold documents with a number from 2 to 20 pages. When the conventional stapler is applied to staple documents with 40 pages, the operation of the conventional stapler with a conventional transmission mechanism will become unstable so the use of the conventional stapler is limited.<br>
To overcome the shortcomings, the present invention tends to provide a stapler to mitigate or obviate the aforementioned problems. SUMMARY OF THE TNVF.NTION<br>
The main objective of the invention is to provide a stapler to harmonize the operations of a labor-saving mechanism and a leg-flattine device and<br><br>
maximize pages of documents that the stapler can hold.<br>
The stapler comprises a supporting base, a magazine assembly, a trigger assembly, a leg-flatting device, a pushing arm and a guiding device. The magazine assembly is pivotally cormected to the supporting base. The trigger assembly is connected pivotally to the supporting base and comprises a trigger lever connected pivotally to the supporting base. The leg-flatting device has a sliding base, a moving base and an anvil element. The sliding base is slidably mounted on the supporting base. The moving base is connected operationally to the supporting base at a position above the sliding base. The anvil element is mounted in the moving base. The pushing arm is cormected pivotally to the trigger lever of the trigger assembly and has a bottom end abutting the sliding base to push the sliding base to slide relative to the supporting base. The guiding device is mounted between the pushing arm and the magazine assembly to allow the pushing arm to move relative to the magazine assembly along a horizontal travel.<br>
Accordingly, the time difference effect provided by the labor-saving mechanism can be well transmitted to the leg-flatting device to harmonize operations of these two devices. In addition, the bottom end of the pushing arm can be kepi at a nearly straight moving travel before the magazine cap abutting with the document. Thus, shaking of the pushing arm can be prevented during the movement of the pushing arm and the operation of the stapler is stable even when the stapler is applied to hold few pages or a large number of pages. Consequently, the time differences of the operations of the leg-flatting device for stapling different pages of documents will be automatically adjusted to a<br><br>
consistent condition. Thus, the pages of documents that the stapler can hold together can be maximized and the versatility of the stapler is improved.<br>
Other objects, advantages and novel features of the invention will become more apparent from the following detailed description when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>

In a preferred embodiment, the moving base (44) is pivotally connected to the side plates (12) of the supporting base (10). The moving base (44) has an abutting flange (442) formed on a bottom at the front end of the moving base (44) and abuts with the sliding base (42). With the abutment of the abutting flange (442) with the sliding base (42), the moving base (44) is kept from pivoting relative to the supporting base (10).<br>
The anvil element (46) is mounted in the moving base (44) and may be securely attached to the bottom board (11) of the supporting base (10) and held in a front end of the moving base (44).<br>
The pushing arm (50) is connected pivotally to the trigger lever (32) of the trigger assembly (30) with a pivotal pin. Preferably, the lever spring (36) is mounted around the pivotal pin between the trigger lever (32) and the pushing arm (50) to make the pushing arm (50) and the lever spring (36) connected to the trigger lever (32) at a same point. The pushing arm (50) has a bottom end abutting the abutting protrusion (422) on the sliding base (42) to push the sliding base (42) to slide relative to the supporting base (10). Preferably, the pushing arm (50) has a pushing rod (52) mounted on the bottom end and abuts against the abutting protrusion (422).<br>
The guiding device (60) is mounted between the pushing arm (50) and the magazine assembly (20) to allow the pushing arm (50) to move relative to the magazine assembly (20) along a horizontal travel.<br>
In a first embodiment, the guiding device (60) comprises two guiding<br><br>
arms (62) and two guiding tabs (64).<br>
The guiding arms (62) are formed on and separated from a top of the magazine (22) and may be inverse L-shaped, such that a guiding channel (622) is defined between the top of the magazine (22) and each guiding ann (62). The guiding tabs (64) are formed on the pushing arm (50) and respectively extend slidably in the guiding channels (622).<br>
In a second embodiment, with reference to Fig. 6, the guiding device comprises two guiding boards (66) and at least one guiding rod (68). The guiding boards (66) are integrally formed on and protrude from the magazine (22) of the magazine assembly (20) and each guiding board (66) has a guiding charmel (662) transversely defined through the guiding board (66). The at least one guiding rod (68) is mounted on the pushing arm (50A) and extends slidably through the guiding channels (662) in the guiding boards (66).<br>
In a third embodiment, with reference to Figs. 7 and 8, the guiding device comprises a guiding collar (70) and at least one guiding rod (74). The guiding collar (70) is mounted around the magazine (22) of the magazine assembly (20) and has two guiding boards (72) formed on the guiding collar (70). Each guiding board (72) has a guiding channel defined transversely through the guiding board (72). The at least one guiding rod (74) is mounted on the pushing arm (50B) and extends slidably through the guiding channels in the guiding boards (72) on the guiding collar (70).<br>
With such an arrangement, with further reference to Figs. 2 to 4, when the trigger lever (32) is pressed for stapling documents, the trigger lever (32) with the magazine assembly (20) are pivoted and move downward relative to the<br><br>
supporting base (10). When the magazine cap (25) abuts with the documents and the trigger lever (32) is further pressed, one of the staples in the staple channel (222) will be discharged from the magazine (22) to staple the documents together. With the trigger lever (32) and the magazine (22) being pivotally cormected to the supporting base (10) respectively at the middle and the rear end, a labor-saving mechanism is implemented by the supporting base (10), magazine (22) and trigger lever (32) to provide a labor-saving capability to the stapler.<br>
When the magazine cap (25) abuts against the documents and the trigger lever (32) is ftirther pressed, the sliding base (42) will be pushed to move relative to the supporting base (10) by the pushing arm (50). Consequently, the sliding base (42) will leave from the position where abutting with the abutting flange (442) on the moving base (44), so that the moving base (44) is allowed to move downward with the trigger lever (32) and the magazine (22) relative to the supporting base (10). Thus, the legs of the triggered staple can contact and be clinched by the anvil element (46) to be flatted.<br>
During the movement of the pushing arm (50,50A,50B) before the magazine cap (25) abutting with the documents, the guiding tabs (64) or guiding rods (68,74) of the guiding device (60) will move horizontally relative to and along the guiding channels (622,662). Consequently, the bottom end of the pushing arm (50,50A,50B) can be kept at a nearly straight moving travel during the downward movement of the pushing arm (50,50A,50B), such that the sliding base (42) will be kept at the position where abutting with the abutting flange (442) of the moving base (44). Additionally, shaking of the pushing arm (50,50A,50B) can also be prevented during the movement of the pushing arm<br><br>
{50,50A,50B). Thus, the moving base (44) is kept from pivoting relative to the supporting base (10) before the magazine cap (25) abutting with the documents. Accordingly, the leg-flatting device (40) is well combined with the labor-saving mechanism by the pushing arm (50,50A,50B) and the guiding device (60), and the operations of these two devices is harmonized. The movement of the pushing arm (50,50A,50B) is stable during the operation of the stapler, and the moving base (40) is kept stationary before the magazine cap (25) abutting with the documents. Therefore, with reference further to Fig. 5, the moment of the pushing arm (50,5OA,50B) pushing the sliding base (42) will be automatically adjusted based on the number of pages of the documents to harmonize the time differences of actuating the leg-flatting device (40) for stapling different pages of documents, such as 40 or 2 pages. The pages of the documents that the stapler can hold together can be maximized, and the operation of the stapler is improved and versatile.<br>
