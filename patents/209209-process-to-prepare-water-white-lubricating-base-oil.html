PROCESS TO PREPARE WATER-WHITE LUBRICATING BASE OIL<br>
The invention relates to a process to prepare a water-white lubricating base oil having a saturates content of more than 90 wt%, a sulphur content of less than 0.03 wt% and a viscosity index (VI) of between 80-120 by subjecting a non-water-white hydrocarbon feed having a lower saturates content than the desired saturates content to a hydrogenation step. In a hydrogenation step the main reaction is the hydrogenation of aromatic compounds and any other unsaturated compound to saturate compounds.<br>
Lubricating base oils having the above properties are sometimes referred to as a API Group II base oils as defined in API Publication 1509: Engine Oil Licensing and Certification System, 'Appendix E-API Base Oil Inter-changeability Guidelines for Passenger Car Motor Oil and Diesel Engine Oils". These properties are also mentioned in Oil &amp; Gas Journal; Sept. 1, 1997, pages 63-70.<br>
In the above referred to Oil &amp; Gas Journal article various routes to Group-II base oils are described. All of the possible routes will involve at one point a hydrogenation of the aromatics and other unsaturated compounds to obtain a base oil having the desired saturates content. Such a hydrogenation will typically be performed by contacting the feed with hydrogen in the presence of a hydrogenation catalyst, typically a Group VIII metal supported catalyst.<br>
US-A-5935416 describes a process to prepare API Group II base oils, wherein the above to referred hydrogenation step is performed as a so-called cold (mild) hydrofinishing step at a temperature of between 230 and 300 °C. The disclosed catalyst used in the<br><br>
hydrofinishing step is a catalyst containing Group VIB metals and a non-noble Group VIII metal.<br>
WO-A-9802502 discloses a process to prepare API Group II base oils, wherein the hydrogenation process step is performed using a hydrogenation catalyst comprising a platinum/palladium alloy. The illustrated reaction temperature of the hydrogenation was 232 °C.<br>
GB-A-1381004 discloses a process to prepare a base . oil by contacting a feed with a nickel-tungsten on alumina catalyst at temperature of between 360 and 410 °C and subsequently contacting the effluent of said step with a catalyst comprising a crystalline aluminosilicate faujasite and palladium at a temperature of between 230 and 370 °C. According to this publication hydrogenation and desulphurisation takes place in the first step and conversion of polycyclic naphthenes and isomerisation of paraffins takes place in the second step. This second step cannot be considered to be a hydrogenation step in view of the conversion reactions taking place in this step as catalysed by the crystalline aluminosilicate faujasite.<br>
GB-A-1333826 discloses a hydrogenation step in a process to prepare base oils. In Example 1 of this .publication a three-stage hydrogenation process is illustrated using a nickel on Kieselguhr catalyst, wherein the reaction temperature was 221 °C in the first stage, 232 °C in the second stage and 260 °C in the third stage. The increased severity of the hydrogenation conditions was necessary, according to this publication, to improve the colour.<br>
Applicants have found it almost impossible to prepare in a practical manner water-white Group II base oils,  especially having a saturates content of more than 95 wt% and up to 99 wt%, and especially starting from the more difficult feeds containing higher sulphur and/or nitrogen<br><br>
levels.   Either coloured Group II base  oils   or water-white products  having a  saturates  content  of  less  than  90 wt% were prepared.  With a practical manner  is  here meant  a process  having an acceptable capacity and/or  having  an acceptable reactor volume.<br>
Water-white base oils  are desirable because,   for example,   it ensures  the absence of heavy polyaromatics and other harmful  species which are  detrimental to  the-product  quality,   such as  for example  the   oxidation stability.  The colour is  suitably expressed by means  of Colour  Saybolt.   Preferably the base  oil  has   a Colour Saybolt  of above 20  and more preferably  above 2'5.   The method of determining Colour Saybolt  is  described  in ASTM D-156 method.<br>
It  is the object of the present  invention to provide a hydrogenation process wherein a water-white base  oil having the desired properties  can be  obtained.<br>
This  object  is  achieved with the   following process.<br>
Process to prepare a water-white  lubricating base  oil having a  saturates  content of more than  90  wt%,   a  sulphur content  of less  than 0.03 wt%  and a viscosity index  of between  80-120 by subjecting a non-water-white hydrocarbon feed having a lower saturates   content  than the desired saturates content to a hydrogenation  step, the hydrogenation  step comprising contacting  the  feed with hydrogen in the presence of a hydrogenation catalyst,   wherein the contacting is  performed in two steps:<br>
(a)	contacting the hydrocarbon  feed with  hydrogen  in  the presence  of a hydrogenation catalyst  at  a   temperature  of above 300   °C and at  a WSHV of between  0,3   and 2  kg  of  oil per  litre  of catalyst per hour,   and<br>
(b)	contacting the  intermediate product  obtained in<br>
step   (a)   with hydrogen in the presence  of  a  hydrogenation catalyst  at a temperature of below 280   °C.<br><br>
It has been found that with the hydrogenation process according the invention water-white lubricating base oils can be prepared having a high saturates content.<br>
The hydrocarbon feed which is used in step (a) may be obtained from various sources. A most common source of the hydrocarbon feed to be used in step (a) is a hydrocarbon feed which.in turn is obtained starting from a vacuum distillate or a de-asphalted vacuum residue. These vacuum distillates are obtained by first distilling a petroleum crude feedstock at atmospheric conditions wherein a residue is obtained, which residue is subsequently distilled at reduced pressure obtaining vacuum distillates and a vacuum residue. From the vacuum residue asphalt's are removed in a de-asphalting unit, thereby obtaining a de-asphalted vacuum residue. Part of the aromatics are removed from the vacuum distillate or de-asphalted vacuum residue by means of solvent extraction. In an optional subsequent step wax is removed from the solvent extracted product to obtain the hydrocarbon feed which can be used in step (a) . Typically the wax is removed by solvent dewaxing. Optionally wax is removed by means of catalytic dewaxing or isodewaxing.<br>
Optionally the solvent refined product as described above is first subjected to a combined, hydrodesulphurisation (HDS) and/or hydrodenitrogen-ation (HDN) step before being used as hydrocarbon feed of step (a). This is advantageous when the solvent refined intermediate product contains high levels of sulphur and/or nitrogen.<br>
The feed of step (a) may also be prepared by processes starting from a vacuum distillate or de-asphalted vacuum residue involving a hydrodesulphurisation (HDS) and/or hydrodenitrogenation (HDN) step followed by a hydrocracking step and optionally a<br><br>
catalytic dewaxing or isodewaxing step as known to one skilled in the art.<br>
Another source of the hydrocarbon feed to step (a) is the product obtained by catalytic dewaxing or isodewaxing a feed containing a high fraction, preferably more than 50 wt%, of wax. Examples of such waxy feeds are slack wax and synthetic waxes as obtained in a Fischer-Tropsch process. Another example of a waxy feed is the high boiling fraction of a hydrocracker process^ which process primarily prepares lower boiling middle distillates. Examples of a suitable catalytic dewaxing or isodewaxing processes are described in WO-A-200029511 and EP-A-536325.<br>
The product obtained in the hydrogenation process according to the present invention can be further treated, for example in a clay treating process or contacting with active carbon, as for example described in US-A-4795546 and EP-A-712922, in order to improve the stability of the base oil.<br>
If wax is still present in the feed to step (a) a dewaxing step may be performed on the product of the process according the invention in order to meet any pour  point specification. This dewaxing process may be a solvent dewaxing process or catalytic dewaxing or isodewaxing process as known to one skilled in the art.<br>
It has been found that the hydrogenation process according'the present invention is particularly suitable when preparing the desired base oils starting from the more difficult feeds, sometimes referred to as refractory feeds, which feeds are characterised by.a relatively high sulphur, nitrogen and/or aromatics content and/or a darkish colour. Especially when preparing base oils having a very high saturates content of more than 95 wt%, more especially more than 98 wt%, it has been found that when starting from these more difficult feeds water-white<br><br>
base  oils were difficult  to prepare with the  state  of the art processes.<br>
The  aromatics  content of the  feed to  step   (a)   can be between  10%  and  65 wt%.   The more difficult  feed may contain between  35-65 wt% aromatics.   The  sulphur  content can be  above 0.03 wt% to even values up to and exceeding 3  wt%.   The nitrogen content  can be above  1000 ppmw  to even values up to and exceeding 2000 ppmw.   Suitably the sulphur  content  is  lower than 0.03 wt% and more preferably lower than  1000 ppmw sulphur.   Suitably  the nitrogen content will be  lower than 100 ppmw  and more preferably lower than  50 ppmw nitrogen.<br>
The  colour of the  feed to step   (a)   will be non-white. The  invention is  especially advantageous when starting from very coloured hydrocarbon feeds to step   (a) .   The colour  of the feed will then be such  that  it  cannot be expressed anymore by means of Saybolt Colour.  When expressed in terms of ''ASTM colour"  as described  in ASTM  D-1500 method,   the  colour of such a  feed is   higher than  0.5.   The more difficult feed will have  a  colour of more than  3  and especially 4  or above.<br>
The  hydrogenation catalyst is suitably a  supported catalyst comprising a dispersed Group VIII metal. Possible Group VIII metals are cobalt,  nickel^  palladium and platinum.   Cobalt and nickel containing catalysts may also comprise a Group VIB metal,   suitably molybdenum and tungsten.<br>
Suitable  carrier or support materials  are amorphous refractory oxides.   Examples of suitable amorphous refractory oxides  include inorganic oxides,   such  as alumina,   silica,   titania,   zirconia,' boria,   silica-alumina,   fluorided alumina,   fluorided silica-alumina  and mixtures  of two  or more of these.<br>
Suitable hydrogenation catalysts  include those catalysts comprising as one or more of nickel   (Ni)   and<br><br>
cobalt (Co) in an amount of from 1 to 25 percent by weight (%wt), preferably 2 to 15 %wt, calculated as element relative to total weight of catalyst and as the Group VIB metal component one or more of in an amount of from 5 to 30  %wt,   preferably 10 to 25 %wt, calculated as element relative to total weight of catalyst. Examples of suitable nickel-molybdenum containing catalyst are KF-847 and KF-8010 (AKZO Nobel) iyi-8-24 and M-8-25 (BASF), and C-424, DN-190, HDS-3 and HDS-4 (Criterion). Examples of suitable nickel-tungsten containing catalysts are NI-4342 and NI-4352 (Engelhard), C-454 (Criterion). Examples of suitable cobalt-molybdenum containing catalysts are KF-330 (AKZO-Nobel), HDS-22 (Criterion) and HPC-601 (Engelhard).<br>
Suitable hydrogenation catalysts have a good hydrogenation performance and are less sensitive for sulphur and/or nitrogen which may be present in the feed. When processing sulphur free feeds a pure nickel containing catalyst might be used. For hydrocracked feeds, especially containing a low amount of sulphur of between 50 and 1000 ppmw, preferably platinum containing and more preferably platinum and-palladium containing catalysts are used in steps (a) and optionally in step (b) . Especially suitable when processing the above referred to non-white feeds, which may contain high levels of sulphur and/or nitrogen,, such as for example the refractory feeds as described above, are the platinum/palladium containing catalysts. More preferably such catalysts are used in both step (a) and step (b) . The catalyst of step (a) and (b) are preferably the same. The total amount of these noble Group VIII metal component (s) present on the catalyst is suitably from 0.1 to 10 %wt, preferably 0.2 to 5 %wt, which weight percentage indicates the amount of metal (calculated as element) relative to total weight of catalyst.<br><br>
Preferred supports for these palladium and/or platinum containing catalysts are amorphous silica-alumina, whereby more preferably the silica-alumina comprises from 2 to 75 %wt of alumina. Examples of suitable silica-alumina carriers are disclosed in WO-A-9410263. A preferred catalyst comprises an alloy of palladium and platinum preferably supported on an amorphous silica-alumina carrier of v/hich the commercially available catalyst C-624   of Criterion Catalyst Company (Houston, TX) is an example. These catalyst are advantageous because they deactivate less when the sulphur content of the feed is relatively high.<br>
Step (a) is performed at a temperature of above 300 °C. In this step the main part of the hydrogenation of the aromatic compounds take place, in particular the hydrogenation of mono-aromatics. The temperature will suitably not exceed  400   °C and preferably is in the range of from between 300 and 380 °C. The operating hydrogen pressure may range from 10 to 250 bar. It has been found that improved results are obtained at higher pressures, preferably above 100 bar and more preferably between 120 and 250 bar. The WHSV (Weight hourly space velocity) ranges from 0.3 to 2 kg of oil per litre of catalyst per hour (kg/l.h). The actual operating conditions will depend on the required degree of saturation and the aromatics content in the feed and can be easily determined by one skilled in the art given the above guidelines.<br>
Step (b) is performed at a temperature of below 280 °C and more preferably below 250 °C. In this step the colour improvement takes place. The minimum temperature is suitably above 100 °C. The operating hydrogen pressure may range from 10 to 250 bar. It has been found that improved results with respect to colour are obtained at higher pressures, preferably above 100 bar and more<br><br>
preferably between 120 and 250 bar. The WHSV preferably ranges from 0.3 to 3 kg of oil per litre of catalyst per hour (kg/l.h) and more preferably between 1 and 1.5 kg/l.h. The actual operating conditions will depend on the required colour and the colour of the feed and can be easily determined by one skilled in the art given tha above guidelines.<br>
Step (a) and step (b) are preferably performed at the same hydrogen partial pressure for practical reasons. The hydrogenation catalyst is preferably present in a packed bed reactor. Step (a) and Step . (b) can be performed in a continues operation in two separate sequentially arranged reactors, suitably with means to cool the intermediate product before it is used in step (b). Suitable cooling means are indirect heat exchangers, for example tube/shell heat exchangers. It is also possible to perform step (a) and (b) in one and the same reactor in a so-called blocked out operation, wherein first the feed is fed to the reactor under the conditions of step (a) and second the collected intermediate product is fed to the same reactor under the conditions of step (b). The .latter procedure is advantageous v;ith respect to the number of required hydrogenation reactors when a two step hydrogenation according to the invention is only occasionally required.<br>
Optionally, for example v;hen the required temperature difference between steps (a) and (b) is not too big, step (a) and step (b) can be performed in a stacked bed column. Between the catalyst beds means to reduce the temperature, for example by means of a quench, will be present.<br>
The invention will be illustrated by the following non-limiting examples.<br><br><br>
The feed described in Table 1 was hydrogenated by contacting with a platinum/palladium catalyst of the Criterion Catalyst Company, namely the C-624 catalyst at a hydrogen partial pressure of 200 bar and a WSHV of 1 kg/l.hr at 370 °C and at a recycle gas rate of 1500 Nl/kg. The effluent of this reaction was hydrogenated under the same conditions but now at 230 °C, The resultant base oil had a saturates content of 98.2 wt% and a Colour Saybolt of -f-28, a sulphur content of 6-6 mg/kg and a VI of 106.<br>
Example 1 illustrates that with the process of the invention Group II base oils can be prepared having a very high saturates content and an  excellent colour. Example 2<br>
Example 1 was repeated except that the pressure was 140 bar and the temperature in the first hydrogenation step was 345 °C.   The resultant base oil had a saturates<br><br>
content   of  95.6 wt%  and a Colour Saybolt  of  +24,   a sulphur  content  of  6.2 mg/kg and a VI  of  102. Comparative  Experiment  A<br>
A feed,   obtained by first  hydrocracking  a  base  oil distillate  fraction and  subsequently catalytic  dewaxing, contained  about  21  v;t%  aromatics.   This  feed was hydrogenated by contacting with a platinum/palladium catalyst  of  the  Criterion Catalyst Company,   namely  the . C-624   catalyst  at  a hydrogen partial pressure  of   140  bar and  a WSHV of  1   kg/l.hr and  at  a  recycle gas  rate   of 1500  Nl/kg  at  different   temperatures.
