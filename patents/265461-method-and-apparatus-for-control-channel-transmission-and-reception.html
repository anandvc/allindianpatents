METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR CONTROL CHANNEL TRANSMISSION AND RECEPTION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates generally to control channel transmission and<br>
reception and in particular, to a method and apparatus for control channel transmission<br>
and reception within a communication system.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Communication systems typically employ control channels to transmit<br>
information such as resource allocation assignment messages and other signaling<br>
messages. Modern cellular systems currently under development support a wide variety<br>
of options and modes, and utilize advanced physical layer and MAC layer techniques.<br>
For instance, in the IEEE 802.16e standard, there are multiple frame sizes, coding<br>
schemes, or optional antenna modes. The resource allocation can use a frequency-<br>
diversity or a frequency-selective assignment policy. While all these techniques have<br>
the potential of significantly improving the system performance of communication<br>
systems, they also require a lot of additional signaling. Because of this additional<br>
signaling, the amount of resources allocated to the control channel needs to be<br>
significantly higher than for existing systems.<br>
An imprudent control channel design can bring the amount of overhead needed<br>
for the control information to unreasonably large values. In some cases, increasing the<br>
control channel size to support an option might offset all the gains (in terms of spectral<br>
efficiency) of that particular option, or could even reduce spectral efficiency. Therefore<br>
there is a need for a method and apparatus for control channel transmission and<br>
reception that efficiently controls channels and offers the necessary flexibility to<br>
support multiple options while occupying a limited amount of physical resource.<br>

Detailed Description of the Drawings<br>
In order to address the above-mentioned need, a method and apparatus for<br>
control channel transmission and reception is provided herein. In particular, the use of a<br>
partitioned and structured control channel (PSCCH) is provided that leverages the<br>
benefits of a common control channel while maintaining favorable aspects of dedicated<br>
control. During operation, control information is distributed over a number of<br>
frequency and/or time partitions P,- with l<i each p is encoded with></i>
monotonically non-increasing reliability level. There are at least two partitions having<br>
two reliability levels, and/or two different modulations or coding or power levels to be<br>
used for control channel transmission.<br>
Control information for a given remote unit can be distributed on one or several<br>
partitions, from Py to P*, where P* is encoded with the lowest reliability level that can<br>
be decodable by the remote unit at an acceptable error rate. A reliability level is defined<br>
as a combination of a channel coding rate of a modulation and of a transmission power<br>
level. The reliability level may also be associated with a repetition factor or spreading<br>
factor. An order is defined on the reliability level such as if message A is encoded with<br>
a higher reliability level than message B, message A can be decoded hi harsher RF<br>
channel conditions (e.g., at a lower SNR).<br>
The Partitioned Structured Control Channel allows the system to communicate<br>
control information at different reliability levels within a same frame. It also enables<br>
efficiency enhancing techniques such as power stealing and interference avoidance.<br>
Additionally, the overhead is significantly reduced as compared with other control<br>
channel transmission techniques.<br>
The present invention encompasses a method comprising the steps of producing<br>
a plurality of control messages that need to be transmitted to a plurality of remote units<br>
within a frame of a control channel, determining a reliability level for each control<br>
message, and grouping control messages having a similar reliability level to produce a<br>
plurality of grouped control messages. Each group is encoded such that at least two<br>
groups are encoded with a different encoding scheme, and then an order is determined<br><br>
WO 2007/040905	PCT/US2006/034949<br>
3<br>
for transmitting the encoded groups. Finally, the encoded groups are transmitted a<br>
control channel having the determined order within the frame.<br>
The present invention additionally encompasses a method comprising the steps<br>
of receiving a control channel transmission over a control channel, the control channel<br>
transmission comprising a plurality of partitions, with each partition containing groups<br>
of messages such that least two of the groups of messages have differing encoding,<br>
modulation, and/or power levels. A first encoding scheme is used to decode a group of<br>
messages, and a second encoding scheme is used to decode a second group of<br>
messages.<br>
The present invention additionally encompasses an apparatus that comprises a<br>
reliability assigner receiving a plurality of control messages that need to be transmitted<br>
to a plurality of remote units within a frame of a control channel, and determining a<br>
reliability level for each control message. The apparatus additionally comprises<br>
ordering circuitry grouping control messages having a similar reliability level to<br>
produce a plurality of grouped control messages, an encoder encoding each group<br>
wherein at least two groups are encoded with a different encoding scheme, and a<br>
transmitter determining an order for transmission of the encoded groups and<br>
transmitting the encoded groups on a control channel having the determined order<br>
within the frame.<br>
The present invention additionally encompasses an apparatus that comprises a<br>
receiver receiving a control channel transmission over a control channel, the control<br>
channel transmission comprising a plurality of partitions, with each partition containing<br>
groups of messages, at least two of the groups of messages having differing encoding,<br>
modulation, and/or power levels. The apparatus additionally comprises a decoder using<br>
a first encoding scheme to decode a group of messages and using a second encoding<br>
scheme to decode a second group of messages.<br>
Turning now to the drawings, wherein like numerals designate like components,<br>
FIG. 1 is a block diagram of communication system 100. Communication system 100<br>
comprises a plurality of cells 105 (only one shown) each having a base transceiver<br>
station (BTS, or base station) 104 in communication with a plurality of remote,<br>
stationary or mobile units 101-103. In the preferred embodiment of the present<br>
invention, communication system 100 utilizes a communication system protocol using<br>
Adaptive Modulation and Coding (AMC) with Orthogonal Frequency Division<br>
Multiplexing (OFDM). The architecture may also include the use of spreading<br>
techniques such as multi-carrier CDMA (MC-CDMA), multi-carrier direct sequence<br>
CDMA (MC-DS-CDMA), Orthogonal Frequency and Code Division Multiplexing<br>
(OFCDM) with one or two dimensional spreading, or may be based on simpler time<br><br>
WO 2007/040905	PCT/US2006/034949<br>
4<br>
and/or frequency division multiplexing/multiple access techniques, or a combination of<br>
these various techniques. However, in alternate embodiments communication system<br>
100 may utilize other wideband cellular communication system protocols such as, but<br>
not limited to, TDMA or direct sequence CDMA.<br>
As discussed, communication system 100 may utilize different modulation and<br>
coding formats for transmission of data, either payload data or control data. The<br>
payload data may utilize Adaptive Modulation and Coding (AMC). With AMC, the<br>
modulation and coding format of a data transmission for a particular receiver is<br>
changed to predominantly match a current received signal quality (at the receiver) for<br>
the particular frame being transmitted. Base station 104 will communicate during a<br>
control channel a modulation and coding level to each remote units 101-103 so that the<br>
remote units 101-103 knows how to demodulate the payload data. In one embodiment<br>
of the present invention, control data may also be transmitted with a link quality<br>
dependent modulation and coding rate. Thus, data transmissions with high quality are<br>
typically assigned higher order modulations rates and/or higher channel coding rates<br>
with the modulation order and/or the code rate decreasing as quality decreases. For<br>
those receivers experiencing high quality, modulation schemes such as 16 QAM, 64<br>
QAM or 256 QAM are utilized, while for those experiencing low quality, modulation<br>
schemes such as BPSK or QPSK are utilized.<br>
Multiple coding rates may be available for each modulation scheme to provide<br>
finer granularity, to enable a closer match between the quality and the transmitted<br>
signal characteristics (e.g., R=l/4, 1/2, and 3/4 for QPSK; R=l/2 and R=2/3 for 16<br>
QAM, etc.). Base station 104 will determine the modulation/coding scheme utilized for<br>
a particular mobile based on its particular channel quality and other characteristics such<br>
as the Doppler speed or the target signal quality for the particular data transmission.<br>
FIG. 2 illustrates a control-channel transmission scheme that is utilized by<br>
communication system 100. Particularly, FIG. 2 illustrates control channel 200 being<br>
divided into N partitions 201, with the N partitions 201 equaling a single control<br>
channel frame. The control channel occupies one or more OFDM bauds. In other<br>
embodiments, the channel may occupy a frequency band for the frame duration or be<br>
code-multiplexed with the data for a CDMA system. During operation, base station 104<br>
will group remote units 101-103 based on their received signal quality. Transmit power<br>
and encoding schemes for control information are allowed to vary for each group of<br>
remote units 101-103 and for different type of control information. Each partition has<br>
its own power level and encoding scheme, ordered with a monotonically non-increasing<br>
reliability level as the partition number increases.<br><br>
WO 2007/040905	PCT/US2006/034949<br>
5<br>
For example, assuming that the same power spectral density and modulation<br>
scheme for all the partitions, partition 1 may be utilizing 1/8 rate encoding to transmit<br>
control information, while partition 3 may be utilizing 14 rate encoding. Control<br>
information for those remote units 101-103 experiencing poor reception (e.g. a low<br>
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)) will be transmitted on partitions using lower (i.e., more<br>
robust) coding rates, while control information for those remote units 101-103<br>
experiencing good reception (e.g. a high SNR) will be transmitted on partitions using<br>
higher encoding rates (i.e., less robust).<br>
A remote unit 101-103 wishing to decode control information will receive the N<br>
partitions and decode the first partition (Pi). If Pi is successfully decoded, an attempt to<br>
decode successive partitions takes place until all partitions in the frame are decoded or<br>
decoding fails for a particular partition. Information from all decoded partitions is<br>
assembled and control information is extracted from the assembled partitions. From the<br>
control information, the remote unit will be able to determine such things as resource<br>
allocations and downlink and uplink assignments.<br>
Note that in the above process, the remote unit decodes all partitions it can<br>
decode, even those that possibly have no information for it. Alternatively, the remote<br>
unit can stop decoding after a determining that a partition has a control assignment for<br>
it, through, for example, finding its user ID or another ID associated with the user or<br>
user's traffic. Additionally, the parameters for decoding Pi can be a priori known: for<br>
instance, they could be specified in the frame format, within initial signaling, in a<br>
superframe, etc. Alternatively, the encoding scheme can be estimated blindly from a<br>
very limited set of possible parameters. Finally, the modulation and coding scheme<br>
used on P, can be signaled in Pj-i or could be blindly detected.<br>
When the parameters for decoding Pi are known a priori, the first partition Pi<br>
may be a known size at a known location in the frame with a known modulation and<br>
coding scheme. Pi can be used to send the information that must be decoded by all the<br>
remote units. Also, Pi can contain a description of the structure of the PSCCH by<br>
indicating the location, size, modulation and coding scheme for other partitions, for<br>
example all the subsequent partitions or the next partition. Pi may also be used to send<br>
a group of control messages for users in addition to partition configuration information.<br>
The first partition may be kept to a manageable size by not including user ID<br>
information indicating what partition the user should decode for control information;<br>
the partition configuration information allows for the decoding of all partitions<br>
(assuming channel quality is sufficient) for extraction any user-specific control<br>
information (typically identified with the user ED) within a partition.<br><br>

In FIG. 2, the partitions may be representative of a physical mapping, such as<br>
partitions occupying contiguous subcarriers of an OFDM system as indicated.<br>
However, partitions may also be viewed as logical partitions, such that the control<br>
information is different than a physical mapping. For example, an interleaver may<br>
shuffle the partition information such that symbols from each partition are distributed<br>
over the resources for the control channel.<br>
FIG. 3 is a more-detailed illustration of a control-channel scheme. As with FIG.<br>
2, FIG. 3 may be representative of a logical or physical mapping. FIG. 3 shows how the<br>
partition structure improves the performance of the control channel when compared<br>
with the Common Control Channel. Each scenario shown in FIG. 3 has remote units<br>
(referred to as Subscriber Units (SUs)) with low SNRs decoding fewer partitions to<br>
retrieve their control information that those remote units having higher SNR levels.<br>
Thus, a remote unit with a low SNR may only decode the first two partitions, while<br>
those having better SNR levels may decode up to four partitions to retrieve their control<br>
information.<br>
The first scenario illustrates that the PSCCH uses a quarter of the resources of<br>
the Common Control Channel while still being able to convey the same number of<br>
assignments, thereby reducing the control information overhead by 75%. With the<br>
common control channel structure all the assignment messages need to be sent with the<br>
same modulation and coding scheme typically chosen low in order to accommodate<br>
edge-of-cell users. With the PSCCH structure, the assignments are sent using a less<br>
conservative modulation and coding scheme, except for users that need that<br>
conservative modulation and coding scheme.<br>
Alternatively, the PSCCH can be used as shown for scenario 2, i.e. the PSCCH<br>
uses half the amount of resources as the Common Control Channel, but carries twice as<br>
many assignments. This scenario occurs frequently when the system supports "fat pipe"<br>
scheduling or MIMO to enhance peak throughput. The third scenario is an extreme case<br>
where the PSSCH supports extremely low SNR users by utilizing power stealing from<br>
medium SNR users, by allocating fewer assignments in the frame. In this case, with the<br>
PSCCH structure, it is possible to serve users that could not be served with the<br>
Common Control Channel (or that would result in extremely high control overhead). In<br>
all cases, the PSCCH can be configured that some users might only decode Pi. As is<br>
evident, assignments for low SNR users occupy a much bigger portion of the frame<br>
than those for high SNR users. Because of this, only a few assignments for low SNR<br>
users can physically be scheduled in a frame. The signaling that need to be carried over<br>
the control channel is therefore also reduced for those frames.<br><br>
WO 2007/040905	PCT/US2006/034949<br>
7<br>
For modern systems using multiple antennas, and advanced techniques such as<br>
frequency selective scheduling, it is anticipated that ftie amount of resources dedicated<br>
to the control channel will be significant. Therefore, using the PSCCH structure can<br>
increase system capacity by providing an enhanced control channel design that fits well<br>
the requirements from both the physical and the MAC layers.<br>
FIG. 4 is a block diagram of a base station 104 of FIG. 1. As shown, base<br>
station 104 comprises reliability assigner 401, group ordering circuitry 403, encoder<br>
405, and transmitter 407. During operation control information for multiple users is<br>
produced by base station 104. As discussed, control information comprises information<br>
such as, but not limited to resource allocations and downlink and uplink assignments.<br>
Control information enters reliability assigner 401. Reliability assigner 401 determines<br>
a reliability level for each message to be transmitted. Control information must be<br>
encoded robustly enough to be decoded at an acceptable error rate by each remote unit<br>
receiving an assignment in the frame. Thus, for remote units experiencing low SNR, a<br>
more robust encoding technique may be employed so that they can properly receive the<br>
control information. In a similar manner certain control messages may be deemed<br>
critical, and hence be encoded with a more robust encoding technique than non-critical<br>
control messages.<br>
Regardless of the technique used for assigning reliabilities to control messages,<br>
reliability assigner 401 takes control messages and groups them into messages having<br>
substantially similar reliabilities such that the reliability needed for group i is greater<br>
than or equal to the reliability needed for group j, where i<j. thus control messages></j.>
being transmitted to remote units having a low SNR will have group indexes lower than<br>
those being transmitted to remote units experiencing higher SNR levels. In a similar<br>
manner, more critical messages may be in groups having lower index numbers than<br>
non-critical messages. Depending on the number of groups (partitions), the number of<br>
total resources for control channel transmission, and the number of user's control<br>
channels (e.g., resource allocations) that must be provided, some users may be assigned<br>
to groups with a higher or lower reliability than desired.<br>
Once control messages have been properly grouped, an error detection field<br>
(e.g., a cyclic redundancy check (CRC) bit) may be added for each encoded group<br>
before they enter encoder 405. Encoder 405 determines a transmission rate for each<br>
group and encodes each group into data symbols at a fixed encoding rate with an<br>
encoding algorithm which facilitates subsequent maximum likelihood decoding of the<br>
data symbols into data bits (e.g. convolutional or block coding algorithms). As<br>
discussed above, groups requiring a more-reliable transmission scheme may be<br>
encoded with a more-robust encoding scheme (e.g., 1/8 rate encoding), while groups<br><br>
WO 2007/040905	PCT/US2006/034949<br>
8<br>
requiring a less-reliable transmission, scheme may utilize less-reliable encoding<br>
techniques (e.g., 3/4 rate encoding).<br>
The encoded groups then enter transmitter 407 where they are properly<br>
modulated and transmitted. The modulation of each group depends on the modulation<br>
required to meet the target reliability level. In one example, one group uses QPSK and<br>
another uses 16QAM. In other examples two groups may have the same modulation<br>
such as QPSK, with reliability (if different) distinguished by code rate, power level,<br>
repetition factor, or another transmission parameter. As discussed above, those groups<br>
that require a more reliable transmission scheme are transmitted earlier in the control<br>
channel frame.<br>
FIG. 5 is a block diagram of a remote unit of FIG. 1. As shown, the remote unit<br>
comprises receiver 501, decoder 503, analyzer 505 and extractor 507. During operation,<br>
a control channel frame is received by receiver 501 where encoded groups of control<br>
information are successively appropriately demodulated. As discussed above, the<br>
modulation of each group depends on the modulation required to meet the target<br>
reliability level, and may be known a priori, signaled in an earlier or first partition, or<br>
blindly detected. Each group is modulated and encoded with potentially a differing<br>
modulation and encoding scheme, depending upon the criticality of the control<br>
message, or alternatively, depending upon the channel condition experienced by the<br>
receiver. Receiver 501 outputs the first encoded group to decoder 503 where it is<br>
properly decoded. Decoder 503 passes the decoded information to the analyzer 505. If<br>
the group has been successfully decoded (e.g. verified by checking the appended CRC),<br>
analyzer 505 requests receiver 501 and decoder 503 to process the next encoded group.<br>
This process is repeated until analyzer 505 detects that an encoded group failed to be<br>
successfully decoded or that all encoded groups have been decoded. If a group fails to<br>
be successfully decoded, subsequent groups could be decoded, though the probability<br>
of success will be low as the subsequent groups have the same or lower reliability.<br>
As discussed above, a first decoding scheme is used to decode a first encoded<br>
group received over the first partition and a second decoding scheme is used to decode<br>
a second encoded group received over the second partition. A first and a second<br>
modulation scheme are used to demodulate the first and the second groups if the<br>
modulation scheme varies among groups. In a preferred embodiment, the receiving and<br>
decoding information for the encoded group i am carried out in the encoded group i-1.<br>
In an alternate embodiment, the receiving and decoding information can be known a-<br>
priori based on the frame format.<br>
FIG. 6 is a flow chart showing operation of the base station of FIG. 3. The logic<br>
flow begins at step 601 where reliability assigner 401 receives a plurality of control<br><br>
WO 2007/040905	PCT/US2006/034949<br>
9<br>
messages for a plurality of remote units. As discussed above, these messages are<br>
produced by the base station and comprise such information as how to demodulate the<br>
payload data. At step 603 a reliability level for each control message is determined. As<br>
discussed above, the reliability level for a particular message is preferably dependent<br>
upon the SNR experienced by the remote unit receiving the message, however,<br>
alternatively the reliability level for a particular message may be dependent upon how<br>
critical the message is perceived to be, with critical messages being assigned a higher<br>
reliability level.<br>
At step 605, ordering circuitry groups control messages having a similar<br>
reliability level to produce a plurality of grouped messages. These group messages are<br>
output to encoder 405 where each group is properly encoded (step 607). As discussed<br>
above, at least two groups are encoded with a different encoding scheme, with those<br>
groups having a higher reliability level will be more-robustly encoded than those<br>
groups having a lower reliability level. The encoded groups are passed to transmitter<br>
407 where an order for transmission is determined (step 609). As discussed, those<br>
encoded groups with a higher reliability level are transmitted prior to those having a<br>
lower reliability level. In an alternate embodiment of the present invention information<br>
may be placed by encoder within each group that indicates an encoding scheme for<br>
subsequent groups. The encoder may additionally place a CRC field within each<br>
encoded group. Finally, at step 611 the encoded groups are transmitted in the<br>
determined order over the control channel. As discussed above, each group may be<br>
transmitted at differing power levels, where a sum of power per encoded group over the<br>
frame remains fixed. Additionally, the control-channel bandwidth may remain fixed.<br>
FIG. 7 is a flow chart showing operation of the remote unit of FIG. 4. The logic<br>
flow begins at step 701 where a control channel transmission is received. As discussed<br>
above each frame of the control channel is partitioned into groups with at least two<br>
groups having differing encoding, modulation, and/or power levels. A fixed number of<br>
modulation symbols exist per control-channel frame with the control channel preferably<br>
having a fixed frequency. At step 703 a first encoding scheme is used to decode the<br>
first group of messages. As discussed above, the encoding scheme for the first group<br>
may be universally know beforehand, with the encoding scheme used on group Pj is<br>
signaled in group Pn.<br>
At step 705 it is determined if the first group of messages where properly<br>
decoded, and if so the logic flow continues to step 707 where the next group of<br>
messages is decoded. If, however, the first group of messages where not properly<br>
decoded, the logic flow ends at step 713. At step 709 it is determined if the next group<br>
of messages were properly decoded, and if so, the logic flow continues to step 711. At<br><br>
WO 2007/040905	PCT/US2006/034949<br>
10<br>
step 711 it is determined if there are any more groups to decode in the frame, and if so,<br>
the logic flow returns to step 707, otherwise the logic flow ends at step 713 where any<br>
control messages for the remote unit are processed.<br>
While the invention has been particularly shown and described with reference to a<br>
particular embodiment, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that various<br>
changes in form and details may be made therein without departing from the spirit and<br>
scope of the invention. It is intended that such changes come within the scope of the<br>
following claims.<br><br>
