In order to apply the active ingredients to a pest, a locus of pest, or to a plant susceptible to attack by a pest, or, as a fungicide to a plant, to a seed of a plant, to the locus of the plant or seed, to soil or to any other growth medium, the active ingredients are usually formulated into a composition which includes, in addition to the active ingredients, a suitable inert diluent or carrier and, optionally, a surface active agent (SFA). SFAs are chemicals which are able to.modify the.properties of an. interface (for example, liquid/solid, liquid/air or liquid/liquid interfaces) by lowering the interfacial tension and thereby leading to changes in other properties (for example dispersion, emulsification and wetting).<br>
In one particular aspect the present invention merefore also provides novel insecticidal compositions comprising gamma cyhalothrin and one or more compounds possessing insecticidal, nematicidal, acaricidal, molluscicidal, fungicidal, plant growth<br><br>
said agents to improve water dispersibility/solubility. The mixture is then ground to a fine powder. Similar compositions may also be granulated to form water soluble granules (SG). Wettable powders (WP) may be prepared by mixing the active ingredients with one or more solid diluents or carriers, one or more wetting agents and, preferably, one or more dispersing agents and, optionally, one or more suspending agents to facilitate the dispersion in liquids. The mixture is then ground to a fine powder. Similar compositions may also be granulated to form water dispersible granules (WG).<br>
Granules (GR) may be formed either by granulating a mixture of the active ingredients and one or more powdered solid diluents or carriers, or from pre-formed blank granules by absorbing the active ingredients (or a solution thereof, in a suitable agent) in a porous granular material (such as pumice, attapulgite clays, fuller's earth, kieselguhr, diatomaceous earths or ground corn cobs) or by adsorbing the active ingredients (or a solution thereof, in a suitable agent) on to a hard core material (such as sands, silicates, mineral carbonates, sulphates or phosphates) and drying if necessary. Agents which are commonly used to aid absorption or adsorption include solvents (such as aliphatic and aromatic petroleum solvents, alcohols, ethers, ketones and esters) and sticking agents (such as polyvinyl acetates, polyvinyl alcohols, dextrins, sugars and vegetable oils). One or more other additives may also be included in granules (for example an emulsifying agent, wetting agent or dispersing agent).<br>
Dispersible Concentrates (DC) may be prepared by dissolving the active ingredients in water or an organic solvent, such as a ketone, alcohol or glycol ether. These solutions may contain a surface active agent (for example to improve water dilution or prevent crystallisation in a spray tank).<br>
Emulsifiable concentrates (EC) or oil-in-water emulsions (EW) may be prepared by dissolving the active ingredients in an organic solvent (optionally containing one or more wetting agents, one or more emulsifying agents or a mixture of said agents). Suitable organic solvents for use in ECs include aromatic hydrocarbons (such as alkylbenzenes or alkylnaphthalenes; exemplified byS0LVESSO-1O0; SOLVESSG 150 and SOLVES SO 200; SOLVESSO is a Registered Trade Mark), ketones (such as cyclohexanone or methylcyclohexanone) and alcohols (such as benzyl alcohol, furfuryl alcohol or butanol), N-alkylpyrrolidones (such as N-methylpyrrolidone or N-octylpyrrolidone), dimethyl amides of fatty acids (such as C8-C10 fatty acid dimethyl amide) and chlorinated hydrocarbons. An EC product may spontaneously emulsify on addition to water, to produce an emulsion with<br><br>
Capsule suspensions (CS) may be prepared in a manner similar to the preparation of EW formulations but with an additional polymerisation stage such that an aqueous dispersion of oil droplets is obtained, in which each oil droplet is encapsulated by a polymeric shell and contains the active ingredients and, optionally, a carrier or diluent therefor. The polymeric shell may be produced by either an interfacial polycondensation reaction or by a coacervation procedure. The compositions may provide for controlled release of the active ingredients and they may be used for seed treatment, the active ingredients may also be formulated in a biodegradable polymeric matrix to provide a slow, controlled release of the compound.<br>
A composition may include one or more additives to improve the biological performance of the composition (for example by improving wetting, retention or distribution on surfaces; resistance to rain on treated surfaces; or uptake or mobility of the active ingredients). Such additives include surface active agents, spray additives based on oils, for example certain mineral oils or natural plant oils (such as soy bean and rape seed oil), and blends of these with other bio-enhancing adjuvants (ingredients which may aid or modify the action of the active ingredients.<br>
The active ingredients may also be formulated for use as a seed treatment, for example as a powder composition, including a powder for dry seed treatment (DS), a water soluble powder (SS) or a water dispersible powder for slurry treatment (WS), or as a liquid composition, including a flowable concentrate (FS), a solution (LS) or a capsule suspension (CS). The preparations of DS, SS, WS, FS and LS compositions are very similar to those of, respectively, DP, SP, WP, SC and DC compositions described above. Compositions for treating seed may include an agent for assisting the adhesion of the composition to the seed (for example a mineral oil or a film-forming barrier).<br>
Wetting agents, dispersing agents and emulsifying agents may be surface SFAs of the cationic, anionic, amphoteric or non-ionic type.<br>
Suitable SFAs of the cationic type include quaternary ammonium compounds (for example cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide), imidazolines and amine salts.<br>
Suitable anionic SFAs include alkali metals salts of fatty acids, salts of aliphatic monoesters of sulphuric acid (for example sodium lauryl sulphate), salts of sulphonated aromatic compounds (for example sodium dodecylbenzenesulphonate, calcium dodecylbenzenesulphonate, butylnaphthalene sulphonate and mixtures of sodium di-isopropyl- and tri-wopropyl-naphthalene sulphonates), ether sulphates, alcohol ether sulphates (for example sodium laureth-3-sulphate), ether carboxylates (for example sodium<br><br>
The active ingredients may also be injected into plants or sprayed onto vegetation using electrodynamic spraying techniques or other low volume methods, or applied by land or aerial irrigation systems.<br>
Compositions for use as aqueous preparations (aqueous solutions or dispersions) are generally supplied in the form of a concentrate containing a high proportion of the active ingredient, the concentrate being added to water before use. These concentrates, which may include DCs, SCs, ECs, EWs, MEs SGs, SPs, WPs, WGs and CSs, are often required to withstand storage for prolonged periods and, after such storage, to be capable of addition to water to form aqueous preparations which remain homogeneous for a sufficient time to enable them to be applied by conventional spray equipment. Such aqueous preparations may contain varying amounts of the active ingredients (for example 0.0001 to 10%, by weight) depending upon the purpose for which they are to be used.<br>
The active ingredients may be used in mixtures with fertilisers (for example nitrogen-, potassium- or phosphorus-containing fertilisers). Suitable formulation types include granules of fertiliser. The mixtures suitably contain up to 25% by weight of the active ingredients. The invention therefore also provides a fertiliser composition comprising a fertiliser and the active ingredients.<br>
The amount of composition of the present invention generally applied for the control of insect pests gives a rate of active ingredient from 0.01 to 10 kg per hectare, preferably from 0.1 to 6 kg per hectare.<br>
The mixture of the invention is preferably presented in a single composition. However the components may be presented in separate containers, one containing gamma-cyhalothrin optionally in combination with a solid or liquid diluent, and the second containing a further active ingredient optionally in combination with a solid or liquid diluent. Alternatively the components may be presented in a two pack-container, one compartment of which contains gamma-cyhalothrin optionally in combination with a solid or liquid diluent and a second compartment which contains a further active ingredient optionally in combination with a solid or liquid diluent<br>
The contents of the two containers or the two compartments can then be admixed, for example by mixing both in water prior to administration.<br>
In another aspect the present invention provides a method of combating insect, acarine or nematode include insect pests such as Lepidoptera, Diptera, Homoptera and Coleoptera (including Diabrotica, that is, com rootworm), pests associated with agriculture<br><br>
(American dog tick), Ctenocephalides felis (cat flea), Liriomyza spp. (leafminer), Musca domestica (housefly), Aedes aegypti (mosquito), Anopheles spp. (mosquitoes), Culex spp. (mosquitoes), Lucillia spp. (blowflies), Blattella germanica (cockroach), Periplaneta americana (cockroach), Blatta orientalis (cockroach), termites of the Mastotermitidae (for i     example Mastotermes spp.), the Kalotermitidae (for example Neotennes spp.), the<br>
Rhinotermitidae (for example Coptotermes formosanus, Reticulitermes flavipes, R. speratu, R. virginicus, R. hespents, and R. santonensis) and the Termitidae (for example Globitermes sulphureus), Solenopsis geminata (fire ant), Monomorium pharaonis (pharaoh's ant), Damalinia spp. and Linognathus spp. (biting and sucking lice), Meloidogyne spp. (root knot nematodes), Globodera spp. and Heterodera spp. (cyst nematodes), Pratylenchus spp. (lesion nematodes), Rhodopholus spp. (banana burrowing nematodes), Tylenchulus spp.(citrus nematodes), Haemonchus contortus (barber pole wonn), Caenorhabditis elegans (vinegar eelworm), Trichostrongylus spp. (gastro intestinal nematodes) and Deroceras reticulatum (slug).<br>
The invention therefore provides a method of combating and controlling insects, acarines, nematodes or molluscs which comprises applying an insecticidally, acaricidally, nematicidally or molluscicidally effective amount of a mixture containing gamma-cyhalothrin and one or more compounds possessing insecticidal, nematicidal, acaricidal, molluscicidal, fungicidal, plant growth regulating or herbicidal activity to a pest, a locus of pest, or to a plant susceptible to attack by a pest, to a seed of a plant, to the locus of the plant or seed, to soil or to any other growth medium (for example a nutrient solution).<br>
The term "plant" as used herein includes seedlings, bushes and trees. Furthermore, the fungicidal method of the invention includes protectant, curative, systemic, eradicant and antisporulant treatments.<br>
The invention is illustrated by the following Examples.<br>
