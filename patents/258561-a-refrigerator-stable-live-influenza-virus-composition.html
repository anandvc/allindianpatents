COMPOSITIONS<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0001] Vaccines against various and evolving strains of influenza are important not only from a community health stand point, but also commercially, since each year numerous individuals are infected with different strains and types of influenza virus. Infants, the elderly, those without adequate health care and immunocompromised persons are at special risk of death from such infections. Compounding the problem of influenza infections is that novel influenza strains evolve readily, thereby necessitating the continuous production of new vaccines.<br>
[0002] Numerous vaccines capable of producing a protective immune "response specific for such different influenza viruses have been produced for over 50 years and include, e.g., whole virus vaccines, split virus vaccines, surface antigen vaccines and live attenuated virus vaccines. However, while appropriate formulations of any of<br>
these vaccine types are capable of producing a systemic immune response, live<br>
attenuated virus vaccines have the advantage of being also able to stimulate local<br>
mucosal immunity in the respiratory tract. A vaccine comprising a live attenuated virus that is capable of being quickly and economically produced and that is capable of easy storage/transport is thus quite desirable. Even more desirable would be such a vaccine that would be capable of storage/transport at refrigerator temperatures (e.g., approximately 2-8 °C).<br>
[0003] To date, all influenza vaccines commercially available in the U.S. have been propagated in embryonated hen eggs. Although influenza virus grows well in hen eggs, the production of vaccine is dependent on the availability of such eggs. Because the supply of eggs must be organized, and strains for vaccine production selected months in advance of the next flu season, the flexibility of this approach can be limited, and often results in delays and shortages in production and distribution. Therefore, methods to increase stability (e.g., at refrigerator temperatures) of the produced vaccine, are greatly desirable as they can prevent deterioration of vaccine stock, which would otherwise necessitate new production, etc.<br>
[0004] Systems for producing influenza viruses in cell culture have also been developed in recent years (See, e.g., Furminger. Vaccine Production, in Nicholson et al. (eds.) Textbook of Influenza pp. 324-332; Merten et al. (1996) Production <f influenza virus in cell cultures for vaccine preparation cohen shafferman novel strategies design and production of vaccines pp. therefore any methods to increase composition stability storage at refrigerator temperature these systems as well are also greatly desirable.></f>
[0005] Considerable work in the production of influenza virus for production of vaccines has been done by the present inventors and co-workers; see, e.g., U.S. patent application nos. 60/375,675 filed April 26, 2002, PCT/US03/12728 filed April 25, 2003,10/423,828 filed April 25, 2003, and PCT/US05/017734 filed May 20, 2005.<br>
[0006] The present invention provides vaccine compositions that have stability at, for example, refrigerator temperatures (e.g., 4°C) and methods of producing the same.

Furthermore, in various embodiments, the temperature of heating in such embodiments optionally comprises from about 28°C to about 40°C or more, while in some embodiments, the temperature comprises 3 l°C or from about 30°C to about 32°C. The heating in such embodiments optionally occurs before or during or before and during the filtration and optionally comprises from about 50 minutes to about 100 minutes, from about 60 minutes to about 90 minutes, or about 60 minutes. The invention also provides an influenza virus composition<br><br>
produced   by  such   methods   (including   wherein   the   composition   is   a vaccine composition).<br>
Stabilizers and buffers<br>
[0040] Stabilizers of the invention include, for example, one or more of the following: arginine {e.g., 0.5-1%, 1-2%; 1%; 1.2%; 1.5%, 0.75-2%); poloxamer; sucrose {e.g., 2-8%; 2%; 6-8%; 3%; 4%; 5%; 6%; 7%, or 8%); hydrolyzed gelatin {e.g., 1%; 0.5-2%; 1.5%; 0.5%; 0.75%); and glutamate fe.g., 0.05-0.1%, 0.02-0.15%, 0.03%, 0.04%, 0.06%, 0.02-0.3%, or 0.094%)<br>
[0041] Buffers of the invention include, for example, one or more of the following: phosphate buffer (mono or dibasic or both) {e.g., 10-20OmM, pH 7-7.5; 100 mM, pH 7.2; 100 mM, pH 7-7.3); and histidine buffers {e.g., 25 - 50 mM histidine, pH 7-7.5, 50- lOOmM Histidine, pH 7-7.5).<br>
Process Yield<br>
[0042] In one embodiment, methods of producing a liquid formulation of the invention results in an actual or average process yield (from Viral Harvest (VH) to final formulation) of less than 10%, of less than 16%, less than 20%, less than 30%, less than 40%, less than 50%, less than 60%, less than 70%, less than 80%, less than 90%, or less than 93%, or less than 95%.<br>
[0043] It will'be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the various steps of the methods described herein are not required to be performed or required to exist in the same production series. Thus, while in some preferred embodiments, all steps and/or compositions herein are performed or exist, in other embodiments, one or more steps are optionally, e.g., omitted, changed (in scope, order, placement, etc.) or the like,<br>
[0044] It will also be appreciated by those skilled in the art that typical embodiments comprise steps/methods/compositions that are known in the art, e.g., candling of virus containing eggs, inoculation of eggs with viruses, etc. Therefore, those skilled in the art are easily able to determine appropriate conditions, sub-steps, step details, etc., for such known steps to produce the appropriate viruses, virus<br>
solutions, compositions, etc. essentially stable at 2-8°C.    The individual steps are described in greater detail below.<br>
[0045] Further, the present invention provides methods of using such liquid vaccine formulations. For example, vaccine formulations may be administered to a human in order to prevent or reduce the effects of a viral infection, e.g., influenza infection. In one embodiment, formulations of the invention are administered as an immunogenic composition to prevent or reduce the effects of an influenza virus infection.<br>
Refrigerator-stable CAIV formulations<br>
[0046] Prior work by the inventor and co-workers has resulted in the development of a trivalent, live, cold-adapted influenza vaccine (CAIV-T, FluMist®, which is referenced throughout as FluMist, but should be assumed to be FluMist®) administered by nasal spray. The current invention involves the development of a formulation of CAIV-T, which has improved stability profile at refrigerated temperatures. Methods of producing such improved formulations are provided herein and may include one or more of the following steps: a sterile filtration step to reduce contamination risk, ultracentrifugation (e.g., rate zonal centrifugation), and diafiltration. In addition, included herein are a number of methods of producing liquid FluMist and other refrigerator-temperature stable (RTS) formulations of the invention.<br>
[0047] The development of CAIV strains was assisted by Dr. John Maassab of the University of Michigan in the 1960s who serially passaged influenza A and B strains in PCK cells at decreasing temperatures until the resulting strains reproducibly showed the phenotypic properties of cold-adaptation (virus grows well at reduced temperatures compared to wild type virus), temperature sensitivity (virus does not grow well in elevated temperatures in vitro), and attenuation (virus replication is restricted in ferrets). Through development by, e.g., the inventor and coworkers, these properties were used as the basis for development of an annual trivalent vaccine reflecting the CDC-designated vaccines strains for a particular year, through the process of 6:2 genetic reassortment. For example, a 6:2 CAIV strain is produced by in vitro co-infection of the relevant A or B strain Master Donor Virus (MDV) with the circulating<br>
flu sixain of interest, and antibody-mediated selection of the proper reassortant. The target 6:2 reassortant contains HA and NA genes from the circulating strain, and the remaining genes from the cold adapted master donor virus (MDV). The reassortant retains the cold adapted phenotypic properties described above. Further development of CAIV has been- conducted by the inventors and coworkers. FluMist has demonstrated a safe profile and shown efficacy against viral challenge and is approved for commercial pharmaceutical use in many situations.<br>
[0048] The original formulation of FluMist contained virus harvest (VH) produced by infecting specific pathogen-free chicken eggs with Manufacturer's Working Virus Seed (MWVS) of the selected strain, followed by incubation for two to three days, and harvesting infected allantoic fluid. VH was stabilized by the addition at 1/10th volume of a 1OX sucrose phosphate glutamate (SPG) solution. Trivalent FluMist was produced by combining VH from each of the three strains in the vaccines for a given year with stabilized normal allantoic fluid (NAF) to a target concentration of 7.3 logioTCIDso/mL of each strain. The resulting blend was then filled into sprayers fitted with a spray tip allowing intranasal delivery of FluMist vaccine. This product format was used as "frozen FluMist", which was stored in a frozen form. It will be appreciated that the MWVS virus could also optionally be manufactured by, e.g., plasmid reassortment. See, e.g., U.S. patent application nos. 60/375,675 filed April 26, 2002, PCT/US03/12728 filed April 25, 2003, 10/423,828 filed April 25, 2003, PCT/US05/017734 filed May 20, 2005, andUS200501 86563.<br>
[0049] While frozen FluMist can serve as a marked vaccine when frozen after manufacture and held frozen until time of use, a form of FluMist that is stable for transport/storage at refrigerator temperatures is quite desirable. Such "refrigerator-temperature stable" (or RTS) forms are characterized by one or more (but not necessarily all in each embodiment) of the following: retention of stability when distributed as a refrigerated liquid; are passed through sterilizing filters (e.g., 0.2 micron) to provide assurance of a sterile product; have reduced content of egg protein (e.g., substantially free of NAF); have eliminated the need for manufacture of NAF diluent; have a reduced volume of a dose; and comprises either or both arginine and gelatin as excipients (e.g., as stabilizers), hi certain aspects herein, formulations<br>
having one or more such characteristics are referred to as "liquid FluMist" or RTS or various similar terms, to distinguish from other versions of CAIV-T vaccine, such as frozen. The current invention presents these and other aspects.<br>
[0050] In producing/testing a liquid RTS virus composition of the invention, numerous development batches were conducted. Development batches ranged from 2000 to 20,000 eggs per lot, while GMP batches were approximately 10,000 eggs each. It will be appreciated that while various examples and protocols are given herein for production of MWVS viruses {e.g., reassortants), the viruses are optionally produced through different means in different embodiments. For example, in certain embodiments, the viruses herein are optionally made through the protocols shown herein, while in other embodiments, the MWVS viruses are optionally made through, e.g., plasmid reassortment or "plasmid rescue" technologies. See, e.g., U.S. patent application nos. 60/375,675 filed April 26, 2002, PCT/US03/12728 filed April 25, 2003, USSN 10/423,828 filed April 25, 2003, 10/788,236 filed February 25, 2004, PCT/US05/017734 filed May 20, 2005, and US20050186563, which are each incorporated by reference herein. Accordingly, as used herein "infection of a population of host cells" encompasses host cells infected by virus created by or during plasmid reassortment.<br>
[0051] In various embodiments, the invention comprises virus and vaccine compositions that are substantially stable, e.g., do not show unacceptable losses in potency, e.g., potency loss of between 0.5-1.0 logs, or less than 0.5 logs, or less than 1.0 logs, over selected time periods (typically for at least 1 month, for at least 2 months, for at least 3 months, for at least 4 months, for at least 5 months, for at least 6 months, for at least 7 months, for at least 8 months, for at least 9 months, for at least 10 months, for at least 11 months, for at least 12 months, for at least 13 months, for at least 14 months, for at least 15 months, for at least 16 months, for at least 17 months, for at least 18 months, for at least 19 months, for at least 20 months, for at least 21 months, for at least 22 months, for at least 23 months, or for at least 24 months, or for greater than 24 months, etc.) at desired temperatures (e.g., typically 4°C, 5°C, 8°C, from about 2°C to about 8°C or greater than 2°C, or between the ranges of 2°C to 4°C, or between the ranges of 2°C to 8°C).<br>
[0052] While a number of aspects of the invention herein are exemplified or illustrated with FluMist, the principles embodied by the invention are applicable to other virus/vaccine compositions as well and should not necessarily be limited to particular strains/viruses herein. Thus other live attenuated influenza virus and vaccines and compositions are also within the purview of the invention, e.g., ones created through rational means, by human intervention, etc. Also, other viruses of other influenza strains, etc., such as influenza A strains, influenza B strains, attenuated and non-attenuated influenza strains, cold adapted and non-cold adapted influenza strains, temperature sensitive and non-temperature sensitive influenza strains, etc. are all optionally within the embodiments of the current invention. Such other virus and vaccine can be used, e.g., as new vaccine and/or as controls for testing other vaccine either in humans or animals, etc. In addition, other live viral vaccine compositions particularly those comprising live viruses grown in chicken cells or eggs (e.g., measles virus) are embodiments of the invention. Furthermore, the principles embodied by the invention are also largely applicable to virus and vaccine compositions comprising live viruses grown in mammalian cells. See, e.g., U.S. patents 6,244,354; 6,146,873; and 6,656,720.<br>
Bulk Virus Harvest Production<br>
[0053] Purification of the cold-adapted influenza virus (or other similar viruses) and the actual formulation of the compositions are features of RTS, or liquid, virus compositions. Separation of influenza virus from allantoic fluid had been practiced as apart of commercial processes for manufacture of inactivated vaccines. The method of choice for such inactivated vaccine has been ultra-centrifugation. Commercial scale continuous flow ultracentrifuge became available in 1969 and was quickly applied to the preparation of inactivated influenza vaccines. While chromatographic purification of live influenza virus would be an attractive alternative, robust large-scale processes that retain viral activity are not yet available. This is thought to be due to the membrane coat and pleomorphic nature of the influenza virus particle.<br>
[0054] Recovery of live virus (as opposed to inactivated virus) purified by ultra-centrifugation was achieved by the inventors and coworkers and is an embodiment of<br>
the current invention. Further work demonstrated the ability of depth filtration as a commercially viable alternative to swinging-bucket centrifugation prior to ultra-centrifugation, and acceptable recoveries of live virus following filtration through a 0.2 micron filter, and again such is an embodiment of the current invention.<br>
[0055] In one specific embodiment, the median process yield for the VH clarification step of the methods of the invention is at least 30%, or at least 40%, or at least 50%, or at least 60%, or at least 70%, or at least 80%, or at least 90%.<br>
[0056] In another specific embodiment, the median process yield for the ultracentrifugation (e.g., zonal centrifugation) step of the methods of the invention is at least 30%, or at least 40%, or at least 50%, or at least 60%, or at least 70%, or at least 80%, or at least 90%.<br>
[0057] In another specific embodiment, the median process yield for the peak dilution and sterile filtration step of the methods of the invention is at least 30%, or at least 40%, or at least 50%, or at least 60%, or at least 70%, or at least 80%, or at least 90%.<br>
[0058] The ultra-centrifugation step provides the benefit of concentrating CAIV. This supports the use of a smaller delivered volume (0.1 mL per nostril rather than 0.25 mL per nostril, e.g., as might be used for frozen FluMist). Such reduced volume is more typical of nasally administered products and can increase consumer acceptance and reduce product losses due to swallowing or vaccine dripping out of the nose. Infected allantoic fluid harvest liters for CAIV have typically been between 8.3 and 9.5 logioTCID5o/mL, which is more than an order of magnitude above the target product concentration for frozen FluMist (7.3 logio TCIDso/mL, or 7.0 logic TCID50per dose). In the event that a very low titer strain is included hi the annual vaccine recommendation, a liquid or RTS FluMist improves the chances of producing a full strength trivalent vaccine despite the increased virus concentration in the final product compared to frozen FluMist. Liquid or RTS FluMist is optionally formulated to a final concentration of 7.7 logio TCID5o/mL, which delivers the same amount of live virus per dose as frozen FluMist.<br>
[0059] In one specific embodiment, a low titer influenza vaccine composition is provided whereby the viral titer is less than 7.3 logio TCID5o/mL, or less than 7.0 logio<br>
TCID50/mL, or less than 6.0 logio TCID50/mL, or less than 5.0 Iogi0 TCIDso/mL, or less than 4.0 logio TCID50/rnL, or less than 3.0 Iogi0 TCID50/mL, or less than 2.0 log,0 TCIDso/mL. Such low titer influenza vaccine compositions may further comprise a pharmaceutically acceptable adjuvant, e.g., E. coli heat-labile toxin (or fragments thereof), pertussis toxin, aluminum. Other adjuvants include, but are not limited to aluminum phosphate, aluminum hydroxide, MPL.TM. (3-O-deacylated monophosphoryl lipid A; RIBI ImmunoChem Research, Inc., Hamilton, Mont., now Corixa), synthetic lipid A analogs such as 529 (Corixa), Stimulon.TM. QS-21 (Aquila Biopharmaceuticals, Framingham, Mass.), IL-12 (Genetics Institute, Cambridge, Mass.), synthetic polynucleotides such as oligonucleotides containing a CpG motif (U.S. Pat. No. 6,207,646 (28)), and cholera toxin (either in a wild-type or mutant form, for example, where the glutamic acid at amino acid position 29 is replaced by another amino acid, preferably a histidine, in accordance with published International Patent Application Number WO 00/18434).<br>
[0060] In one specific embodiment, diafiltration may be used in the preparation of virus compositions of the invention. For instance, diafiltration may be used to concentrate the virus prior to formulation. Diafiltration may be used in addition to or instead of ultracentrifugation.<br>
[0061] After an initial phase described later herein, cGMP production was initiated at the scale of 10,000 eggs per lot. A/Beijig/262/95 (HIN1), A/Sydney/05/97 (H3N2) and B/Ann Arbor/1/94 (B/harbin/7/94-like) purified monovalent CAIV bulks were manufactured to support subsequent clinical trials. The B/Ann Arbor strain is hereafter referred to as B/Harbin/7/94-like. For convenience, strain designations are often abbreviated {e.g., A/Beijing). The current application describes most heavily the process steps unique to the liquid FluMist, however, steps involved in both or common to both liquid and frozen FluMist are also described herein.<br>
[0062] Methods for egg management and preparation of fresh virus harvest were essentially the same in various embodiments of the current invention (with the exception of automated inoculation and harvesting) for frozen FluMist as for liquid FluMist and those of skill in the art will be aware of similar or equivalent steps which are capable of use with the current invention, hi the current invention, ultra-<br><br>
centrifugation was performed using a Hitachi CP40Y zonal centrifuge and an RP40CT Type D continuous-flow rotor (rotor volume = 3.2L). Virus harvest was first pooled, stabilized with sucrose phosphate glutamate (SPG) to facilitate filtration, then passed through a 5 micron polypropylene filter. The filtrate was then loaded onto a 10% to 60% sucrose gradient, banded for one hour at 40,000 rpm, and eluted into 100-ml fractions.<br>
[0063] Fractions containing high hemagglutinin (HA) levels were pooled, diluted to 0.2M sucrose concentration, and then sterile filtered using a polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) 0.2 micron filter. The resulting bulk purified monovalent CAIV was frozen in IL bottles below -60 degrees C and held for further processing.<br>
Formulation and Filing<br>
[0064] Initial formulation screening determined that the liquid phase stability of purified CAIV at refrigerated temperatures was suitable for an annual vaccine. Hydrolyzed animal gelatin added to the frozen FluMist stabilizer SPG provided the best stability results, with a least stable strain and lot from the CTM-I campaign showing a loss of one log over 6.9 months. Further formulation development studies showed that the stability of liquid FluMist could be further improved by storing frozen just after manufacture, and thawing before final distribution. The stability of the worst-case strain was also improved by addition of arginine. While animal gelatins can raise concerns with regard to transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSE), available formulations lacking gelatin did not achieve the required stability in all embodiments. Thus, porcine gelatin was chosen for the some embodiments of liquid FluMist formulation due to its stabilizing properties and the fact that there are no reported occurrences of TSE in pigs. The harsh chemical processing steps used in collagen hydrolysis are also thought to cause inactivation of prion-sized proteins.<br>
[0065] Frozen, purified monovalent bulk CAIV was shipped and trivalent vaccine was produced under cGMP to support clinical testing of liquid FluMist. A total of six fills were performed. Blending was performed at small scale using a 4-liter glass aspirator flask, and 0.5 mL Becton Dickinson (BD) Hypack SCF (sterile, clean, ready to fill) glass sprayers were filled using an INOVA automated filler/stopperer and<br><br>
associated equipment.   The manufacture of filled trivalent liquid FluMist is described in more detail below.<br>

Description cf Representative Steps in Vaccine Production<br>
[0091] For ease  in discussion  and description,  the  various   steps of vaccine composition production in general, can be thought of as comprising or falling into four<br>
broad groups (roughly similar to the presentation outlined previously above). The first group comprises such aspects as co-infection, reassortment, selection of reassortants, and cloning of reassortants. The second group comprises such aspects as purification and expansion of reassortants. The third group comprises further expansion of reassortants in eggs, along with harvesting and purification of such harvested virus solutions. The fourth group comprises stabilization of harvested virus solutions and potency/sterility assays of the virus solutions. It is to be understood, however, that division of the aspects of the invention into the above four general categories is solely for explanatory/organizational purposes and no inference of interdependence of steps, etc. should be made. Again, it will be appreciated that other steps (both similar and different) are optionally used with the methods and compositions of the invention (e.g., the methods and compositions for RTS vaccine compositions).<br>
[0092] As mentioned above, for ease in discussion and description, the various steps of vaccine production can be thought of as comprising four broad groups. The first group comprises such aspects as co-infection, reassortment, selection of reassortants, and cloning of reassortants.<br>
Group 1<br>
[0093] The aspects of vaccine composition production which are broadly classified herein as belonging to Group 1, comprise methods and compositions related to optimization of co-infection of cell culture lines, e.g., with a master donor virus and one or more wild-type viruses in order to produce specifically desired reasserted viruses; selection of appropriate reasserted viruses; and cloning of the selected reasserted viruses. Reassortment of influenza virus strains is well known to those of skill in the art. Reassortment of both influenza A virus and influenza B virus has been used both in cell culture and in eggs to produce reasserted virus strains. See, e.g., Tannock et al., Preparation and characterisation <f attenuated cold-adapted influenza a reassortants derived from the donor strain vaccine reassortment of strains has also been shown with plasmid constructs. see e.g. u.s. patent application nos. filed april></f>
PCT/US03/12728 filed April 25, 2003 and U.S. Applications  10/423,828, filed April 25, 2003, PCT/US05/017734, filed May 20, 2005; and US200501 86563.<br>
[0094] Reassortment, in brief, generally comprises mixing (e.g., in eggs or cell culture) of gene segments from different viruses. For example, the typical 8 segments of influenza B virus strains can be mixed between, e.g., a wild-type strain having an epitope of interest and a "donor" strain, e.g., comprising a cold-adapted strain. Reassortment between the two virus types can produce, inter alia, viruses comprising the wild-type epitope strain for one segment, and the cold-adapted strain for the other segments. Unfortunately, to create the desired reassortants, sometimes large numbers of reassortments need to be done. After being reasserted, the viruses can also be selected (e.g., to find the desired reassortants). The desired reassortants can then be cloned (e.g., expanded in number).<br>
[0095] Traditional optimization, selection, and cloning of desired reassortants for influenza B virus, typically occurs by co-infection of virus strains into a cell culture (e.g., CEK cells) followed by selection with appropriate antibodies, e.g., against material from one of the parent virus, (usually done in eggs), and cloning or expanding of virus, etc. which is typically done in cell culture. However, such traditional reassortment presents drawbacks in that thousands of reassortments are needed to create the desired segment mix. When such reassortments are done, it is apparent that truly random reassortments are not the end result. In other words, pressures that bias the process exist in the systems. For influenza A strains, however, such processes do not appear to have such bias. For A strains, co-infection of strains (typically into cell culture such as CEK cells) is followed by selection and cloning at the same tune, again, typically in cell culture.<br>
Optimization rf Reassortment<br>
[0096] Various embodiments utilizing the steps in Group 1 can optimize the reassortment process in order to reduce the number of reassortments needed (and thus increase the throughput/stability of the vaccine production process), etc. The steps utilizing such optimization techniques are typically embodied with reassortment of influenza B strains and are typically done in cell culture, e.g., CEK cells. See, e.g.,<br>
U.S. patent application nos. 10/788,236 and PCT/US04/05697 both filed February 25, 2004, which are incorporated by reference in their entirety for all purposes, both within this section and throughout the specification.<br>
[0097] Other methods of reassortment of influenza virus can optionally mix dilutions of a master donor virus (MDV) and a wild-type virus, e.g., a 1:5 dilution of each no matter the concentration of the respective solutions, which are then incubated for 24 and 48 hours at 25°C and 33°C. While such an approach is often acceptable for influenza A strains, influenza B strains do not typically give positive results with such protocol. For example, to achieve the proper 6:2 assortment (i.e., 6 genes from the MDV and 2 genes, NA and HA from the wild-type virus) thousands of reassortments must often be done.<br>
Selection and Cloning of Reassortments<br>
[0098] The steps in Group 1 also comprise selection of reasserted influenza viruses. Reasserted influenza A strains are capable of selection in either cell culture (e.g., CEK cells) or in eggs. However, reasserted influenza B strains present problems when reasserted in cell culture (e.g., when selected for in CEK cells). It is believed that CEK cells interfere with the M gene in influenza B strains, thus reducing the overall production. Various methods of vaccine composition production, see, e.g., See, e.g., U.S. patent application nos. 10/788,236 and PCT/US04/05697 both filed February 25, 2004, utilize different steps for virus reassortment, e.g., selection, such steps can optionally be used to create virus for the vaccine compositions.<br>
Characterization of Reassortments<br>
[0099] Yet other methods of virus/vaccine production utilize applications of a high throughput single strand conformation polymorphism/capillary electrophoresis (SSCP/CE) assay to determine the gene constellation of influenza viruses used herein. Influenza viruses contain 8 gene segments and, as described above, co-infection of a single cell with two different influenza strains can produce reassortant viruses with novel gene constellations distinct from either parent. Thus, some methods can use a SSCP/CE assay to rapidly determine the gene segment constellation of a large number<br>
of influenza virus samples. The influenza viral gene segments are optionally amplified by RT-PCR using fluorescent-labeled primers specific for each of the eight segments. See, also, Arvin et al. (2000) Clin. Micro. J38(2):839-845 which is incorporated herein by reference for all purposes.<br>
Prevention tf Bacterial Contamination<br>
[00100]	Some methods of virus/vaccine production can comprise steps to<br>
detect and/or prevent/detect microbial contamination of eggs in which influenza virus is produced. The microbial detection strategies of the invention are useful for rapid/high throughput microbial detection and, thus, as with many other steps, are useful for increasing throughput and optionally stability in virus/vaccine production.<br>
[00101]	Many current influenza vaccine production strategies, which can<br>
optionally be used with the invention herein, use as a component, the traditional method for influenza virus expansion in specific-pathogen-free fertile chicken eggs. Possible microbial contamination can occur in several points in the production of virus in eggs. Unfortunately, the chicken eggs may have some microorganisms outside of their shells as part of their natural flora. It is also possible to have microorganisms enclosed within the shell of the egg during the development of the chicken embryo. Fertilized chicken eggs are incubated at 37°C in high humidity for development of the embryo, which constitutes prime incubation conditions for many types of microbial contaminants as well. Another possible time of microbial contamination occurs when the shell is punctured to inoculate the egg. Even though prior to virus inoculation, the eggs are often sprayed with alcohol, there is still opportunity for microorganisms to enter into the egg.<br>
[00102]	After expansion of viruses for 2 to 3 days in the eggs, the top of the<br>
eggshell is typically removed for manual harvesting of the allantoic fluid containing virus within the egg., See, above. This harvesting is another point where microbial contamination may originate. Unfortunately eggs with such contaminating bioburden may escape detection, necessitating pooling into multiple bottles to minimize the rejection of the entire lot due to a failed MPA test. Since three influenza strains are typically used in vaccine production, blending of the three strains is required for the<br>
final bulk. In-process MPA (microbiological purity assay) testing is performed, e.g., at virus harvest prior to use in the blending and filling to ensure microbial-free product.<br>
[00103]	After incubation, the "traditional" method of candling is used to<br>
identify infertile and dead eggs that are possibly dead due to natural causes or to microbial contamination (i.e., dead eggs may occur due to infectivity of the virus and/or expansion of microorganisms, both of which require detection and removal of such eggs). Candling comprises, e.g., the process of holding an egg in front of a light source in a darkened room to enable visualization of the developing embryo. Dead eggs are exduded from virus inoculation.<br>
[00104]	As can be seen from the above points, detection of microbial<br>
contamination can be needed at multiple steps during the manufacture of influenza vaccine. There is a need to eliminate or reduce avian and environmental microbes and a need to eliminate or reduce introduction of environmental and human microbes. Current methods for detection of contaminating microorganisms include, e.g., compendia! methods (MPA and Bioburden). Current methods can include, e.g., egg candling during egg pre/post inoculation (which is typically done manually at a rate of about 500 eggs/hour/person); MPA and BioBurden tests which are typically manual and take about 14 days for MPA and about 3 days for BioBurden (which are done during virus harvest); mycoplasma testing; which is typically done manually and takes about 28 days (done during virus harvest); and mycobacterium testing which is typically manual and takes about 56 days (done during virus harvest). Again, see, e.g., U.S. patent application nos. 10/788,236 and PCT/US04/05697 both filed February 25, 2004, for descriptions of various techniques capable of use with the current invention.<br>
Group 2<br>
[00105]	Aspects of virus/vaccine production that fall into Group 2 include<br>
further purification and virus expansion, etc. After the process of correct reassortment and cloning of reassortants (i.e., the 6:2 viruses), such reasserted virus particles are further purified in embryonated hen eggs and the correct clones are expanded in quantity (again through growth in hen eggs) to generate a master virus strain (MVS) or master virus seed, which, in turn, is further expanded to generate a master working<br>
virus strain (MWVS) or manufacturer's working virus seed. Many aspects of purification of virus particles from eggs and use of such purified virus to inoculate more eggs in order to expand the quantity of virus particles are well known to those skilled in the art. Many such techniques are common in the current production of virus particles and have been used for at least 40 years. See, e.g., Reimer, et al. Influenza virus purification with the zonal ultracentrifuge, Science 1966, 152:1379-81. Purification protocols can involve, e.g., ultra-centrifugation in sucrose gradients {e.g., 10-40% sucrose), etc. Also, as noted herein, other procedures, etc. listed in other Groups are also optionally present within Group 2, e.g., prevention of microbial contamination, etc.<br>
Group 3<br>
[00106]	Aspects of virus/vaccine production that fall under the heading of<br>
Group 3 include, e.g., conditioning of the embryonated eggs (e.g., specific handling and environmental conditions involved in the incubation of virus infected eggs) and the harvesting and clarification of influenza virus from the allantoic fluid of the eggs.<br>
[00107]	For example, conditioning, washing, candling, and incubating eggs<br>
which contain the reassorted virus to be used in a vaccine; inoculation, sealing, etc. of such eggs; candling of such eggs; harvesting of the virus solution (e.g., the allantoic fluid or Viral Harvest (VH)) from the eggs; and clarification of the virus solution can all fall within such category. Again, it should be noted that several techniques applicable to the steps in Groups 2 are equally applicable to the steps in Group 3 (e.g., candling, etc.). Several aspects of virus/vaccine production that comprise Groups 3 are well known to those skilled in the art. Various aspects of candling of eggs in virus production, as well as inoculation of eggs with viruses and washing, incubating, etc. of such eggs are well known techniques in the production of virus/vaccines in eggs. Of course, it will be appreciated that such well-known techniques are used in conjunction with the unique and innovate aspects of the current invention. See, e.g., U.S. patent application nos. 10/788,236 and PCT/US04/05697 both filed February 25, 2004, give further steps such as rocking, etc. that can also be used with the methods and<br><br>
compositions of the current invention. Other similar steps can include specific filtering and warming of compositions, again, see, the same.<br>
Filtering and Warming<br>
[00108]	The current invention involves aspects of ultra-centrifugation, see<br>
above, which can fall into the current grouping. In addition, U.S. patent application nos. 10/788,236 and PCT/US04/05697 both filed February 25, 2004 also give other filtering and warming steps that can optionally be used with the methods and compositions of the current invention. As described, the FluMist™ manufacturing process can use embryonated chicken eggs to generate master virus seeds (MVS), manufacturer's working virus seeds (MWVS) and virus harvests (VH). The seeds and viral harvest may contain bioburden (typically bacterial contamination), which would cause the seed or bulk virus product lots to be rejected in the vaccine production process. Of course, it will be appreciated that specific listing or description of particular product types used, sizes, etc., is not to be considered limiting on the current invention unless specifically stated to be so.<br>
Group 4<br>
[00109]	Group 4 of the aspects of vaccine formulation/composition<br>
production comprises, e.g., steps primarily concerned with stabilization (e.g., through addition of components, alterations in buffer/NAF ratios, etc.) and assays of potency/sterility of virus containing solutions. The description of the current invention above, gives various aspects which can optionally be grouped within the current category. See, above.<br>
[00110]	In some embodiments, the final viral solutions/vaccines comprising<br>
live viruses are stable in liquid form for a period of tune sufficient to allow storage "in the field" (e.g., on sale and commercialization when refrigerated at 2-8 °C, 4 °C, 5 °C, etc.) throughout an influenza vaccination season {e.g., typically from about September through March in the northern hemisphere). Thus, the virus/vaccine compositions are desired to retain their potency or to lose their potency at an acceptable rate over the storage period. In other embodiments, such solutions/vaccines are stable in liquid form<br><br>
at from about 2°C to about 8°C, e.g., refrigerator temperature. For example, if a 0.3 log potency loss was acceptable and the storage period were 9 months, then an 0.05 log/month decrease in potency would be acceptable. As another example, if a loss of up to 0.75 log were allowed, a rate of less than or equal to 0.09 log/month would be sufficient to allow stability of materials stored continuously at refrigerator temperature (e.g., 4°C). In other embodiments, such solutions/vaccines are stable in liquid form when stored at from about 2°C to about 8°C. The stability of the composition can comprise between about 1 day and 2 years, between about 10 days and about 2 years, between about 20 days and about 2 years, between about 1 month and about 2 years, between about 2 months and about 2 years, between about 3 months and about 2 years, between about 4 months and about 2 years, between about 5 months and about 2 years, between about 6 months and about 2 years, between about 7 months and about 2 years, between about 8 months and about 2 years, between about 9 months and about 2 years, between about 10 months and about 2 years, between about 11 months and about 2 years, between about 12 months and about 2 years, between about 13 months and about 2 years, between about 14 months and about 2 year, between about 15 months and about 2 years, between about 16 months and about 2 years, between about 17 months and about 2 years, between about 18 months and about 2 years, between about 19 months and about 2 years, between about 20 months and about 2 years, between about 21 months and about 2 years, between about 22 months and about 2 years, between about 23 months and about 2 years, or greater than about 2 years.<br>
[00111]	One may test the stability of a formulation of the invention by a<br>
number of methods. For instance, one may first incubate a formulation at freezing temperatures (e.g., -25 or -7O°C (+/- 10, 20, 30, or 40°C) and then store (or "incubate") the formulation at 4-8°C for a length of time. Alternatively, one may test the stability of a formulation of the invention by simply storing (or "incubating") the formulation at 4-8 °C for a length of time. Potency could be measured by a number of methods as described herein or otherwise known.<br>
Concentration/Diafiltration    of virus harvests<br>
 [00112]	In some methods of vaccine composition production, virus harvests<br>
are optionally concentrated using an appropriate column. See, U.S. patent application nos. 10/788,236 and PCT/US04/05697 both filed February 25,2004.<br>
Stabilizers/Buffers<br>
[00113]	Vaccine composition production can also optionally include various<br>
dilutions of NAF (typically unfractionated NAF) comprising the virus of interest and combinations of, e.g., sucrose, arginine, gelatin, EDTA, etc. See, e.g., U.S. patent application nos. 10/788,236 and PCT/US04/05697, for examples of various combinations possible in different vaccine formulations. Such methods and compositions are preferably stable, e.g., do not show unacceptable losses in potency, e.g., a potency loss of between 0.5-1.0 logs, or less than 0.5 logs, or less than 1.0 logs, over selected time periods (typically at least 6 months, at least 9 months, at least 12 months, at least 15 months, at least 18 months, at least 24 months, etc.) at desired temperatures {e.g.. typically 4°C, 5°C, 8°C, from about 2°C to about 8°C or greater than 2°C, etc.).<br>
[00114]	hi some formulations, compositions can comprise a stabilizer of,<br>
e.g., arginine (of pH from'about 7.0 to about 7.2), either in combination with, or in place of gelatin or gelatin related and/or derived products {e.g., gelatin hydrosylate). See U.S. patent application nos. 10/788,236 and PCT/US04/05697. Also, in many virus solutions/vaccine solutions a base solution of SPG (sucrose, potassium phosphate and monosodium glutamate) is optionally utilized.<br>
[00115]	U.S. patent application nos. 10/788,236 and PCT/US04/05697 both<br>
filed February 25, 2004 give other/additional methods of virus/vaccine composition stabilization, e.g., NAF level manipulation, etc.<br>
Definitions<br>
[00116]	Unless defined otherwise,  all scientific and technical terms are<br>
understood to have the same meaning as commonly used in the art to which they pertain. For the purpose of the present invention the following terms are defined below.<br>
[00117]	The   terms   "nucleic   acid,"    "polynucleotide,"    "polynucleotide<br>
sequence" and "nucleic acid sequence" refer to single-stranded or double-stranded deoxyribonucleotide or ribonucleotide polymers, or chimeras or analogues thereof. As used herein, the term optionally includes polymers of analogs of naturally occurring nucleotides having the essential nature of natural nucleotides in that they hybridize to single-stranded nucleic acids in a manner similar to naturally occurring nucleotides (e.g., peptide nucleic acids). Unless otherwise indicated, a particular nucleic acid sequence optionally encompasses complementary sequences, in addition to the sequence explicitly indicated.<br>
[00118]	The term "gene"  is used broadly to refer to any nucleic acid<br>
associated with a biological function. Thus, genes include coding sequences and/or the regulatory sequences required for their expression. The term "gene" applies to a specific genomic sequence, as well as to a cDNA or an mRNA encoded by that genomic sequence.<br>
[00119]	Genes also include non-expressed nucleic acid segments that, for<br>
example, form recognition sequences for other proteins. Non-expressed regulatory sequences include "promoters" and "enhancers," to which regulatory proteins such as transcription factors bind, resulting in transcription of adjacent or nearby sequences. A "tissue specific" promoter or enhancer is one that regulates transcription in a specific tissue type or cell type, or types.<br>
[00120]	The term "vector" refers to the means by which a nucleic acid can<br>
be propagated and/or transferred between organisms, cells, or cellular components. Vectors include plasmids, viruses, bacteriophage, pro-viruses, phagemids, transposons, and artificial chromosomes, and the like, that replicate autonomously or can integrate into a chromosome of a host cell. A vector can also be a naked RNA polynucleotide, a naked DNA polynucleotide, a polynucleotide composed of both DNA and RNA within<br>
the same strand, apoly-lysine-conjugated DNA orRNA, a peptide-conjugated DNA or RNA, a liposome-conjugated DNA, or the like, that are not autonomously replicating. Most commonly, but not necessarily exclusively, the vectors of herein refer to plasmids.<br>
[00121]	An "expression vector" is a vector, such as a plasmid that is capable<br>
of promoting expression, as well as replication of, a nucleic acid incorporated therein. Typically, the nucleic acid to be expressed is "operably linked" to a promoter and/or enhancer, and is subject to transcription regulatory control by the promoter and/or enhancer.<br>
[00122]	A   "bi-directional   expression   vector"   is  characterized   by two<br>
alternative promoters oriented in the opposite direction relative to a nucleic acid<br>
situated between the two promoters, such that expression can be initiated in both<br>
orientations resulting in, e.g., transcription of both plus (+) or sense strand, and<br>
negative (-) or antisense strand RNAs.	/<br>
[00123]	In the context herein, the term "isolated"  refers to a biological<br>
material, such as a nucleic acid or a protein, which is substantially free from components that normally accompany or interact with it in its naturally occurring environment. The isolated material optionally comprises material not found with the material in its natural environment, e.g., a cell. For example, if the material is in its natural environment, such as a cell, the material has been placed at a location in the cell . (e.g., genome or genetic element) not native to a material found in that environment. For example, a naturally occurring nucleic acid (e.g., a coding sequence, a promoter, an enhancer, etc.) becomes isolated if it is introduced by non-naturally occurring means to a locus of the genome (e.g., a vector, such as a plasmid or virus vector, or amplicon) not native to that nucleic acid. Such nucleic acids are also referred to as "heterologous" nucleic acids.<br>
[00124]	The term "recombinant" indicates that the material (e.g., a nucleic<br>
acid or protein) has been artificially or synthetically (non-naturally) altered. The alteration can be performed on the material within, or removed from, its natural environment or state. Specifically, when referring to a virus, e.g., an influenza virus, is recombinant when it is produced by the expression of a recombinant nucleic acid.<br>
 [00125]	The term "reassortant," when referring to a virus, indicates that the<br>
virus includes genetic and/or polypeptide components derived from more than one parental viral strain or source. For example, a 7:1 reassortant includes 7 viral genomic segments (or gene segments) derived from a first parental virus, and a single complementary viral genomic segment, e.g., encoding hemagglutinin or neuraminidase, from a second parental virus. A 6:2 reassortant includes 6 genomic segments, most commonly the 6 internal genes from a first parental virus, and two complementary segments, e.g., hemagglutinin and neuraminidase, from a different parental virus.<br>
[00126]	The term "introduced" when referring to a heterologous or isolated<br>
nucleic acid refers to the incorporation of a nucleic acid into a eukaryotic or prokaryotic cell where the nucleic acid can be incorporated into the genome of the cell (e.g., chromosome, plasmid, plastid or mitochondrial DNA), converted into an autonomous replicon, or transiently expressed (e.g., transfected mRNA). The term includes such methods as "infection," "transfection," "transformation," and "transduction." In the context of the invention, a variety of methods can be employed to introduce nucleic acids into prokaryotic cells, including electroporation, calcium phosphate precipitation, lipid mediated transfection (lipofection), etc.<br>
[00127]	The term "host cell" means a cell that contains a heterologous<br>
nucleic acid, such as a vector, and supports the replication and/or expression of the nucleic acid. Host cells can be prokaryotic cells such as E. coli, or eukaryotic cells such as yeast, insect, amphibian, avian or mammalian cells, including human cells. Exemplary host cells in the context of the invention include Vero (African green monkey kidney) cells, BHK (baby hamster kidney) cells, primary chick kidney (PCK) cells, Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cells, Madin-Darby Bovine Kidney (MDBK) cells, 293 cells (e.g., 2931 cells), and COS cells (e.g., COS1, COS7 cells).<br>
Influenza Virus<br>
[00128]	The compositions and methods herein are primarily concerned with<br>
production of influenza viruses for vaccines. Influenza viruses are made up of an internal ribonucleoprotein core containing a segmented single-stranded RNA genome<br>
and an outer lipoprotein envelope lined by a matrix protein. Influenza A and influenza B viruses each contain eight segments of single stranded negative sense RNA. The influenza A genome encodes eleven polypeptides. Segments 1-3 encode three polypeptides, making up a RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. Segment 1 encodes the polymerase complex protein PB2. The remaining polymerase proteins FBI and PA are encoded by segment 2 and segment 3, respectively. In addition, segment 1 of some influenza strains encodes a small protein, PB1-F2, produced from an alternative reading frame within the PB1 coding region. Segment 4 encodes the hemagglutinin (HA) surface glycoprotein involved in cell attachment and entry during infection. Segment 5 encodes the nucleocapsid nucleoprotein (NP) polypeptide, the major structural component associated with viral RNA. Segment 6 encodes a neuraminidase (NA) envelope glycoprotein. Segment 7 encodes two matrix proteins, designated Ml and M2, which are translated from differentially spliced mRNAs. Segment 8 encodes NS1 and NS2, two nonstructural proteins, which are translated from alternatively spliced mRNA variants.<br>
[00129]	The eight genome segments of influenza B encode 11 proteins. The<br>
three largest genes code for components of the RNA polymerase, PB1, PB2 and PA. Segment 4 encodes the HA protein. Segment 5 encodes NP. Segment 6 encodes the NA protein and the NB protein. Both proteins, NB and NA, are translated from overlapping reading frames of a biscistronic mRNA. Segment 7 of influenza B also encodes two proteins: Ml and M2. The smallest segment encodes two products, NS1 which is translated from the full length RNA, and NS2 which is translated from a spliced mRNA variant.<br>
Influenza virus vaccine<br>
[00130]	Historically, influenza virus vaccines have primarily been produced<br>
in embryonated hen eggs using strains of virus selected based on empirical predictions of relevant strains. More recently, reassortant viruses have been produced that incorporate selected hemagglutinin and neuraminidase antigens in the context of an approved attenuated, temperature sensitive master strain. Following culture of the virus through multiple passages in hen eggs, influenza viruses are recovered and,<br>
optionally, inactivated, e.g., using formaldehyde and/or p-propiolactone (or alternatively used in live attenuated vaccines).<br>
[00131]	However, production of influenza vaccine in this manner has several<br>
significant concerns. For example, contaminants remaining from the hen eggs can be highly antigenic and/or pyrogenic, and can frequently result in significant side effects upon administration. Thus, another method involves replacement of some percentage of egg components with animal free media. More importantly, virus strains designated for vaccine production must be selected and distributed, typically months in advance of the next flu season to allow time for production and inactivation of influenza vaccine. Again, any improvements in stability in storage time and/or of storage at a more convenient temperature {e.g., refrigerator temperature of about 2-8 °C, e.g., as through use of the methods and compositions of the current invention), are thus quite desirable.<br>
[00132]	Attempts at producing recombinant and reassortant vaccines in cell<br>
culture have been hampered by the inability of some of the strains approved for vaccine production to grow efficiently under standard cell culture conditions. Thus, prior work by the inventor and his coworkers provided a vector system, and methods for producing recombinant and reassortant viruses in culture, thus, making it possible to rapidly produce vaccines corresponding to one or many selected antigenic strains of virus. See, e.g., U.S. patent application nos. 60/375,675 filed April 26, 2002, PCT/US03/12728 filed April 25, 2003 and USSN 10/423,828 filed April 25, 2003, PCT/US05/0 17734 filed May 20, 2005. Of course, such reassortments are optionally further amplified in hen eggs. Typically, the cultures are maintained in a system, such as a cell culture incubator, under controlled humidity and CO2, at constant temperature using a temperature regulator, such as a thermostat to insure that the temperature does not exceed 35 °C. Such pioneering work, as well as other vaccine production, can be further optimized through use of the current invention in whole or part.<br>
[00133]	Reassortant influenza viruses can be readily obtained by introducing<br>
a subset of vectors corresponding to genomic segments of a master influenza virus, in combination with complementary segments derived from strains of interest {e.g., antigenic variants of interest). Typically, the master strains are selected on the basis of desirable properties relevant to vaccine administration. For example, for vaccine<br>
production, e.g., for production of a live attenuated vaccine, the master donor virus strain may be selected for an attenuated phenotype, cold adaptation and/or temperature sensitivity.<br>
FluMisi®<br>
[00134]	As  mentioned  previously,   numerous   examples   and  types   of<br>
influenza vaccine exist. An exemplary influenza vaccine is FluMist which is a live, attenuated vaccine that protects children and adults from influenza illness (Belshe et al. (1998) The efficacy <f live attenuated cold-adapted trivalent intranasal influenza virus vaccine in children n. engl. j. med. nichol et al. effectiveness rf healthy working adults: a randomized controlled trial jama typical embodiments the methods and compositions of current invention are preferably adapted to or used with production flumist vaccine. however it will be appreciated by those skilled art that steps herein also adaptable similar even different viral vaccines their compositions.></f>
[00135]	FluMist™ vaccine strains contain, e.g., HA andNA gene segments<br>
derived from the wild-type strains to which the vaccine is addressed along with six gene segments, FBI, PB2, PA, NP, M and NS, from a common master donor virus (MDV). The MDV for influenza A strains of FluMist (MDV-A), was created by serial passage of the wild-type A/Ann Arbor/6/60 (A/AA/6/60) strain in primary chicken kidney tissue culture at successively lower temperatures (Maassab (1967) Adaptation and growth characteristics (f influenza virus at 25 degrees C Nature 213:612-4). MDV-A replicates efficiently at 25°C (ca, cold adapted), but its growth is restricted at 38 and 39°C (ts, temperature sensitive). Additionally, this virus does not replicate in the lungs of infected ferrets (att, attenuation). The ts phenotype is believed to contribute to the attenuation of the vaccine in humans by restricting its replication in all but the coolest regions of the respiratory tract. The stability of this property has been demonstrated in animal models and clinical studies. In contrast to the ts phenotype of influenza strains created by chemical mutagenesis, the ts property of MDV-A does not revert following passage through infected hamsters or in shed isolates from children (for a recent review, see Murphy &amp; Coelingh (2002) Principles underlying the<br>
development and use <f live attenuated cold-adapted influenza a and b virus vaccines viral immunol.></f>
[00136]	Clinical studies in over 20,000 adults and children involving  12<br>

[00138]	The system and methods described previously are useful for the<br>
rapid production in cell culture of recombinant and reassortant influenza A and B viruses, including viruses suitable for use as vaccines, including live attenuated vaccines, such as vaccines suitable for intranasal administration such as FluMist®. The methods of the current invention herein, are optionally used in conjunction with or in combination with such previous work involving, e.g., reasserted influenza viruses<br>
for vaccine production to produce viruses for vaccines in a more stable, consistent and productive manner.<br>
Cell Culture<br>
[00139]	As previously stated, influenza virus optionally can be grown in cell<br>
culture. Typically, propagation of the virus is accomplished in the media compositions in which the host cell is commonly cultured. Suitable host cells for the replication of influenza virus include, e.g., Vero cells, BHK cells, MDCK cells, 293 cells and COS cells, including 293T cells, COS? cells. Commonly, co-cultures including two of the above cell lines, e.g., MDCK cells and either 293T or COS cells are employed at a ratio, e.g., of 1:1, to improve replication efficiency. Typically, cells are cultured in a standard commercial culture medium, such as Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with serum {e.g., 10% fetal bovine serum), or in serum free medium, under controlled humidity and C02 concentration suitable for maintaining neutral buffered pH (e.g., at pH between 7.0 and 7.2). Optionally, the medium contains antibiotics to prevent bacterial growth, e.g., penicillin, streptomycin, etc., and/or additional nutrients, such as L-glutamine, sodium pyruvate, non-essential amino acids, additional supplements to promote favorable growth characteristics, e.g., trypsin, (3-mercaptoethanol, and the like.<br>
[00140]	Procedures for maintaining mammalian cells in culture have been<br>
extensively reported, and are well known to those of skill in the art. General protocols are provided, e.g., in Freshney (1983) Culture of Animal Cells: Manual of Basic Technique, Alan R. Liss, New York; Paul (1975) Cell and Tissue Culture, 5th ed., Livingston, Edinburgh; Adams (1980) Laboratory Techniques in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology-Cell Culture for Biochemists, Work and Burdon (eds.) Elsevier, Amsterdam. Additional details regarding tissue culture procedures of particular interest in the production of influenza virus in vitro include, e.g., Merten et al. (1996) Production cf influenza virus in cell cultures for vaccine preparation in Cohen and Shafferman (eds.) Novel Strategies in Design and Production of Vaccines, which is incorporated herein in its entirety for all purposes. Additionally, variations in such<br>
procedures adapted to the present invention are readily determined through routine experimentation and will be familiar to those skilled in the art.<br>
[00141]	In a specific embodiment of the invention, host cells of the invention<br>
are cultured and/or infected under serum-free conditions, in the presence or absence of trypsin, and are cultured and/or infected at temperatures ranging from 30 degrees Celsius to 39 degrees Celsius; or 30 degrees Celsius, or 3 1 degrees Celsius, 32 degrees Celsius, 33 degrees Celsius,  34 degrees Celsius, 35 degrees Celsius, 36 degrees Celsius, 37 degrees Celsius, 38 degrees Celsius, or 39 degrees Celsius.<br>
[00142]	Cells for production of influenza virus can be cultured in serum-<br>
containing or serum free medium. In some cases, e.g., for the preparation of purified viruses, it is typically desirable to grow the host cells in serum free conditions. Cells can be cultured in small scale, e.g., less than 25 ml medium, culture tubes or flasks or in large flasks with agitation, in rotator bottles, or on microcarrier beads (e.g., DEAE-Dextran microcarrier beads, such as Dormacell, Pfeifer &amp; Langen; Superbead, Flow Laboratories; styrene copolymer-tri-methylamine beads, such as Hillex, SoIoHill, Ann Arbor) in flasks, bottles or reactor cultures. Microcarrier beads are small spheres (in the range of 100-200 microns in diameter) that provide a large surface area for adherent cell growth per volume of cell culture. For example a single liter of medium can include more than 20 million microcarrier beads providing greater than 8000 square centimeters of growth surface. For commercial production of viruses, e.g., for vaccine production, it is often desirable to culture the cells in a bioreactor or fermenter. Bioreactors are available in volumes from under 1 liter to in excess of 100 liters, e.g., Cyto3 Bioreactor (Osmonics, Minnetonka, MN); NBS bioreactors (New Brunswick Scientific, Edison, N.J.); laboratory and commercial scale bioreactors from B. Braun Biotech International (B. Braun Biotech, Melsungen, Germany).<br>
[00143]	Regardless of the culture volume, in many desired aspects of the<br>
current invention, it is important that the cultures be maintained at an appropriate temperature, to insure efficient recovery of recombinant and/or reassortant influenza virus using temperature dependent multi plasmid systems (see, e.g., Multi-Plasmid System for the Production of Influenza Virus, cited above), heating of virus solutions for filtration, etc. Typically, a regulator, e.g., a thermostat, or other device for sensing<br>
and maintaining the temperature of the cell culture system and/or other solution, is employed to insure that the temperature is at the correct level during the appropriate period (e.g., virus replication, etc.).<br>
[00144]	In   some  methods   (e.g.,   wherein   reasserted  viruses   are to be<br>
produced from segments on vectors) vectors comprising influenza genome segments are introduced (e.g., transfected) into host cells according to methods well known in the art for introducing heterologous nucleic acids into eukaryotic cells, including, e.g., calcium phosphate co-precipitation, electroporation, microinjection, lipofection, and transfection employing polyamine transfection reagents. For example, vectors, e.g., plasmids, can be transfected into host cells, such as COS cells, 293T cells or combinations of COS or 293T cells and MDCK cells, using the polyamine transfection reagent TransIT-LTl (Minis) according to the manufacturer's instructions in order to produce reasserted viruses, etc. Approximately 1 |J.g of each vector to be introduced into the population of host cells with approximately 2 ^1 of TransIT-LTl diluted in 160 Hi medium, preferably serum-free medium, in a total volume of 200 |H. The DNA: transfection reagent mixtures are incubated at room temperature for 45 minutes followed by addition of 800 (Jl of medium. The transfection mixture is added to the host cells, and the cells are cultured as described above or via other methods well known to those skilled in the art. Accordingly, for the production of recombinant or reassortant viruses in cell culture, vectors incorporating each of the 8 genome segments, (PB2, FBI, PA, NP, M, NS, HA and NA) are mixed with approximately 20 |4J TransIT-LTl and transfected into host cells. Optionally, serum-containing medium is replaced prior to transfection with serum-free medium, e.g., Opti-MEM I, and incubated for 4-6 hours.<br>
[00145]	Alternatively, electroporation can be employed to introduce such<br>
vectors incorporating influenza genome segments into host cells. For example, plasmid vectors incorporating an influenza A or influenza B virus are favorably introduced into Vero cells using electroporation according to the following procedure. In brief, approximately 5 x 106 Vero cells, e.g., grown in Modified Eagle's Medium (MEM) supplemented with 10% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS) are resuspended in 0.4 ml OptiMEM and placed in an electroporation cuvette. Twenty micrograms of DNA in a<br>
volume of up to 25 |jl is added to the cells in the cuvette, which is then mixed gently by tapping. Electroporation is performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (e.g., BioRad Gene Pulser II with Capacitance Extender Plus connected) at 300 volts, 950 microFarads with a time constant of between 28-33 msec. The cells are remixed by gently tapping and, approximately 1-2 minutes following electroporation, 0.7 ml MEM with 10% FBS is added directly to the cuvette. The cells are then transferred to two wells of a standard 6 well tissue culture dish containing 2 ml MEM, 10% FBS. The cuvette is washed to recover any remaining cells and the wash suspension is divided between the two wells. Final volume is approximately 3.5 mL. The cells are then incubated under conditions permissive for viral growth, e.g., at approximately 33°C for cold adapted strains. See, e.g., US200501 58342, which is incorporated by reference herein.<br>
Kits<br>
[00146]	To facilitate use of the methods and compositions of the invention,<br>
any of the vaccine components and/or compositions, e.g., virus in various formulations, etc., and additional components, such as, buffer, cells, culture medium, useful for packaging and infection of influenza viruses for experimental or therapeutic vaccine purposes, can be packaged in the form of a kit. Typically, the kit contains, in addition to the above components, additional materials which can include, e.g., instructions for performing the methods of the invention, packaging material, and a container.<br>
Example 1 Development of Liquid FluMist<br>
[00147]	A total of 19 monovalent  bulk lots of virus were initiated under<br>
protocol, including four development lots (CB0006H, CB0008H, CG0017H, CB0018H and CB0019H).   Lots CB0018H and CB0019H were conducted to supply material for various studies and are not discussed further in this application.   Two lots (CBOO180H and CBOO12H) were combined after the ultra-centrifugation   step to produce A/Sydney monovalent bulk CB0020H.   Each lot was initiated with about 2000 eggs.<br>
[00148]	Egg handling and incubation conditions were set up similar to the<br>
process used for production of frozen FluMist, however, manual inoculation and harvesting were used due to the smaller scale, etc. The ultracentrifuge process was scaled down to smaller equipment made by the same manufacturer (Discovery 90, made by Hitachi and marketed by Sorvall/heraus), with a Model P32CT rotor having approximately 470 mL of total capacity. Clarified, stabilized virus harvest was loaded onto a 20% to 60% sucrose gradient, banded for one hour at 32,000 rpm, and eluted into 20 mL fractions. Fractions containing peak HA levels were pooled, diluted to 0.2M sucrose concentration, filtered through a 0.2 micron filter, and then transferred into 250 mL flexible polymer bags (Stedim) which were frozen and held below -60 °C for further manufacture.<br>
[00149]	After a short series of test runs, cGMP manufacturing  was initiated<br>
to support further clinical testing of liquid FluMist. A/Beijing/262/95 (H1N1) and A/Sydney/05/97 (H3N2) were again manufactured, and the B strain was changed to B/Yamanashi/ 166/98. Monovalent bulks produced were frozen and shipped for blending, filing, and packaging. Of course, it will be appreciated here and throughout, that use of particular strains (e.g., Beijing, etc.) should not necessarily be taken as limiting unless specifically stated to be so. Thus for example, the methods and formulations herein can optionally use different strains each influenza season to produce different RTS compositions, etc.<br>
Development and Clinical Trials<br>
 [00150]	The process for liquid compositions was developed and included<br>
monovalent bulk lots CAZOO1-024 and CAZ03 5-043. The clinical trial material (CTM) included monovalent bulk lots CAZ025-CAZ034.<br>
[00151]	The liquid FluMist manufacturing process developed and used for<br>
CTM-I is divided into six discrete process stages below. The process stages 1 through 5 were defined to match the major process steps as conducted using separate manufacturing instruction documents. Stage 6 includes the entire blend and fill process. It will be appreciated that such stages can be roughly compared to the generalized steps outlined below for manufacturing/production of vaccine compositions in general.<br>
Stages<br>
[00152]	Stage 1: receipt and sanitization of SPF eggs; Stage 2: production<br>
of virus harvest; Stage 3: concentration of virus by zonal centrifugation; Stage 4: pooling and dilution of peak fractions; Stage 5: sterile filtration and monovalent bulk storage; and, Stage 6: blend and fill<br>
[00153]	A process flow diagram for the CTM-I monovalent bulk production<br>
is shown in Figure 1. The blend and fill process flow is shown in Figure 2.<br>
Receipt and Sanitization ofSPFeess<br>
[00154]	Specific pathogen-free  (SPF) embryonated eggs were purchased<br>
from SPAFAS, Inc. which utilizes flock management and surveillance programs designed to provide suitable assurance of disease-free eggs. Eggs were laid in the United States and sanitized using Clorwash and Quat 800 sprays. The eggs were then transported by air and road using packaging sufficient to maintain cleanliness and avoid freezing or overheating. Upon receipt, the cold fertile eggs were inspected and stored in an SPF incubation unit at 14 °C +/- 2°C with 60-80% relative humidity (RH) for a maximum of 7 days. The eggs were transferred to trays from the cartons supplied by the vendor and a batch number assigned. Eggs were placed on 36-egg Jamesway trays and the eggshell surfaces sanitized with Chlorwash and Quat 800 in an automated<br>
egg sanitization system to minimize bioburden prior to placing them in the incubator. Chlorwash was prepared at a range of 43-44 °C and 48-49 °C and Quat 800 was prepared at a range of 48-49 °C. Following sanitization, the eggs were placed on trolleys and air dried at ambient temperature for not less than 2 hours. The eggs were then placed in a Buckeye Incubator and incubated at 37.5 °C +/- 1 °C with 60-80% RH for 264 hours +/- 12 hours. After incubation, the SPF eggs were transferred from the SPF egg unit to a candling area. Using a fiber optic lamp, the position of the air sac was located in each egg. Dead or infertile eggs were discarded, and the fertile eggs marked for inoculation.<br>
Production of virus harvests<br>
[00155]	The   fertile   eggs   were   surface   sanitized   with   70%   industrial<br>
methylated spirits (IMS) prior to inoculation and then transferred for mass inoculation. In preparation of the diluted manufacturer's working virus seed (MWVS), the master virus seeds used to produce the MWVS for phase 1 clinical trials were produced using the classical reassortment method. The MWVS, was transferred into the AVU and serial dilutions of the thawed MWVS were prepared in sterile 0.0 IM phosphate buffered saline, pH 7.7 within a microbiological safety cabinet using a sterile disposable pipette for each transfer. The inoculation occurred under laminar flow in a class 10,000 room using a semi-automatic Bibby inoculation machine, which penetrates and inoculates 36 eggs per tray. The target titer of the inoculum was Iogio2.1 TCID50 per 0.1 mL and the dilution was calculated from the predetermined titer of the MWVS. Preparation of each virus inoculum was completed within 2 hours of the removal of the vial from the freezer. Aliquots of the inoculum were stored at 5 +/- 3 °C until use. Inoculum was used within 8 hours of preparation.<br>
Inoculation of SPF eggs<br>
[00156]	Each   tray   of eggs  was   hand-fed   into   the   Bibby   automated<br>
inoculation machine.  A punch was used to pierce the eggshell and penetrate the egg to a preset adjustable depth.  The inoculation needles extended into the egg and the dosing<br>
pump delivered 0.1 mL of the MWVS inoculum into each egg after which the punch was withdrawn. Following inoculation, the egg tray was removed by an operator and the process repeated with a new tray of eggs. The CAP/ inoculated eggs were incubated at 33 +/- 1 °C for a time determined by the growth curve of the virus strain. After incubation, the SPF embryonated eggs were chilled to 28 °C for 18 +/- 6 hours. At the end of chilling, the eggs were transferred for the harvesting step.<br>
Concentration rf Virus by Zonal Centrifugation<br>
Virus harvest (VH)<br>
[00157]	Eggs were harvested with an automatic harvest machine (Bibby).<br>
The trays were hand fed to a decapitation station where the upper section of the eggshell was removed to create an access hole for harvest needle entry. The eggs were visually inspected prior to harvest and unsuitable eggs {e.g., discolored) rejected. The acceptable eggs proceeded to a harvest station, where the allantoic fluid was withdrawn using needles and suction provided by a vacuum system. The harvest was collected mixed in a 100 L jacketed stainless vessel with a jacket temperature of 2-8 °C. Samples of the virus harvest were collected from the VH pool and tested for: potency (TCID50), safety, avian leucosis, M. tuberculosis, mycoplasma, extraneous virus, identity, reverse transcriptase assay, virus genotype, virus phenotype, and attenuation.<br>
Stabilization and clarification<br>
[00158]	The pooled virus harvest (VH) was immediately stabilized at 2-8 °C<br>
to a final concentration of 0.2 M sucrose, 0.01 M phosphate, 0.005M glutamate (SPG), with 1OX SPG (9 parts VH to 1 part 1OX SPG). Samples were collected for potency and bioburden prior to clarification. The stabilized virus harvest was clarified by 5 (im depth filtration to remove particulates prior to purification by high-speed continuous flow centrifugation. Clarified virus harvest was sampled for potency.<br>
Zonal centrifugation, collection, and HA assay of peak fractions<br>
[00159]	Prior to use, the centrifuge rotor was sanitized with a 1:20 dilution<br>
of concentrated formaldehyde solution.   The clarified VH was loaded onto a sucrose<br>
gradient (10-60% sucrose in phosphate buffer, pH 7.2) for continuous high-speed centrifugation using a Hitachi CP40Y zonal centrifuge. The gradient was formed by addition to the centrifuge of a 60% sucrose solution followed by a 10% sucrose solution in phosphate buffer. The centrifuge speed was set to 4,000 rpm for 20 minutes to allow the sucrose solutions to form a density gradient. Centrifuge temperature was set at 2-8 °C during gradient formation. Following gradient formation, buffer flow was initiated and the rotor speed was increased to 40,000 rpm, before the clarified VH was loaded onto the gradient at a rate of 2OL per hour at 40,000 rpm. For a typical CTM-I batch with 10,000 eggs harvested and 6 mL/egg, the duration of the loading step was about three hours. Following loading of the clarified VH, centrifugation was continued at 40,000 rpm for an additional hour to allow the virus to band. The virus particles migrated to the 38-45% sucrose portion of the gradient and concentrate into a "band." At the end of this step, the centrifuge was gradually slowed and then stopped to allow collection of the virus peaks. 100 mL fractions were collected under laminar flow into 125 mL sterile polycarbonate bottles. Fractions were held at 2-8 °C for approximately 1 hour while fractions were assayed for HA activity. Peak fractions were typically found between 38-45% of the sucrose gradient.<br>
Pooling and Dilution of Peak Fractions<br>
[00160]	The centrifuge peak fractions, as identified by the HA assay, were<br>
pooled under a laminar flow hood by aseptically pouring the fractions into a 5 L sterile glass bottle, and mixed by swirling. The refractive index (RI) was read to determine sucrose concentration and the pool sampled for potency. The centrifuge peak fraction pool (CP) was diluted by aseptically adding a calculated volume of sterile cold (2-8°C) phosphate-glutamate buffer, pH 7.2 (PEG buffer) to a final concentration of 0.2M sucrose, 0.1M phosphate, and 0.005 M glutamate. This was typically a 1:6 dilution. The diluted centrifuge peak fraction pool (DCP) was sampled for potency and bioburden.<br>
Sterilefiltration andMonovalent Bulk Storage<br>
 [00161]	The DCP was pumped through sterile tubing to a Class 100 filling<br>
room for sterile filtration. The DCP was sterile filtered with a 0.22 |jm filter into a sterile 5L glass bottle under a Laminair Air Flow hood. The filtered monovalent bull-was mixed and sampled for potency, identity, and sterility testing. The 0.22 |om filter was integrity tested before and after the filtration process. The MB was then aliquoted into sterile one liter polycarbonate bottles. The MB was collected in 500 niL aliquots with a total volume of three to four liters. The sterile one-liter PC bottles were stored at -60°C or below. The titer of the bulk virus was determined by TCID50 assay. Monovalent bulk was then shipped at 
Blend and Fill<br>
[00162]	The major steps for the blend and fill process of the preparation of<br>
the bulk trivalent blend were: Thawing, Preparation of Diluent, Blending, Filling, and Packaging.<br>
Thawing and Blending<br>
[00163] , The appropriate 1 bottles of monovalent bulk were removed from frozen storage (
[00164]	Sterile    sucrose    phosphate     glutamate     (SPG)     diluent    was<br>
manufactured by BioWhittaker (Walkersville, MD). Just prior to manufacture of the liquid FluMist blend, about one-third of the amount of SPG diluent required for the blend was added to a sterile 2-L bottle. The bottle was warmed to room temperature, then hydrolyzed porcine gelatin (powder) was added in the amount need to reach a level of 10 mg/ml in the final blend. The SPG diluent was then passed through the<br>
filter (washing through any residual gelatin) to reach the target volume specified in the blend calculation and stored at 5 ± 3°C until use.<br>
[00165]	Thawed bottles were moved to a blend room and virus aseptically<br>
transferred to a 5 L glass process vessel. The vessel was kept at 5 ± 3°C throughout the blending process and the subsequent filling process by using refrigerated cold packs. The SPG -gelatin diluent was added after the three virus strains had been added, and, if necessary, the pH was adjusted with HC1 to 7.2 ± 0.3.   The three virus strains and diluent were blended by continuous mixing with a magnetic stir bar and stir plate.<br>
Filling and Packaging<br>
[00166]	Following pH adjustment, the bulk trivalent blend vessel was moved<br>
to a filling room and connected to an INOVA filler. The INOVA filling machine filled a preset volume of product into a row of eight BD HYPAK disposable sprayers and then stoppered the sprayers. Sprayer filling and stoppering operations and weight check verifications continued as directed. A new tub of sprayers was manually placed at the in-feed stations upon completion of each fill cycle and the tub of filled sprayers removed to the discharge station. The blend vessel was maintained at 5 ± 3°C with cold packs during the filling process.<br>
[00167]	Following filling of the nasal sprayers, the filled trivalent vaccines<br>
were loaded into tubs and immediately transported via cart to a packaging area for final packaging and labeling. Packaged and labeled sprayers were stored at 5 ± 3°C.<br>
Optimization tf Upstream Operating Parameters Clarification of Harvest by Filtration (5 Mm)<br>
[00168]	Filtration  vs.   Low   Speed  Centrifugation:   Clarification   potency<br>
losses using the standard low-speed centrifugation for frozen FluMist are typically estimated at 0.2 to 0.3 logio TCID5o/mL. An estimated centrifugation loss for two strains was: titer loss was negligible for one strain and 0.3 logs (59% step yield) for a second strain using the standard conditions of 3400g for 20 minutes. When a 5 micron depth filter was used as an alternative to centrifugation during pre-CTM development runs, the average clarification step yield was estimated at 41%. When TCID50 assay<br>
variability was taken into consideration, it was concluded that either method of clarification provided better results than adding after clarification. Filtration was chosen as the clarification method based on ease of operation and scalability.<br>
[00169]	Comparison f Depth Filter Pore Sizes: Development lots CAZ015<br>
- CAZO17 plus the ten CTM-I lots CAZ025 through CAZ034 were used to estimate depth filtration losses using the CTM-I process. A/Beijing, A/Sydney, and B/Harbin have clarification step yields of 147%, 78%, and 73% respectively for the 5 jam clarification step.<br>
[00170]	The 5 |Jm (Pall Profile II) filter was compared to a 20 |jm depth<br>
filter (Pall Profile Star), which was used for lots CAZ035 (A/Sydney), CAZ036 (A/Beijing) and CAZ037 (B/Harbin). A/Beijing, A/Sydney, and B/Harbin had clarification step yields of 65%, 35%, and 209% respectively for the 20 |om clarification step. These yields were comparable to 5 |Jm clarification results, however a process change to the 20 |Jm filter was not recommended for all embodiments due to significant contamination of clarified harvests by red blood cells when larger pore size was used.<br>
Optimization f Downstream Operating Parameters: Centrifuge Scale<br>
[00171]	Centrifuge loading and temperature studies were performed using<br>
the large-scale CP40Y centrifuge and RP40CT Type D continuous-flow rotor; these compared various egg batch sizes and centrifuge temperature set points {see Figure 3). CAOZ15 (B/Harbin), CAZO18 (A/Sydney), CAZ020 (A/Beijing) and CAZ022 (A/Sydney) had batch sizes of lOKeggs and a centrifuge set temperature of 4°C. CAZ 016 (B/Harbin), CAZ019 (A/Sydney), and CAZ021 (A/Beijing) had batch sizes of 20K eggs and a centrifuge set temperature of 14°C. A loading flow rate of 20L/hr was used for all of these studies. Percent recovery in the diluted peak-fraction pool (step yield) was based on the clarified harvest titer in the figure. As can be seen, lots with 1OK egg batches had a recovery range from 40 - 184% whereas the 20K egg batches ranged from 40-55%. The average recovery for the 1OK batch size was 113% and the 20K egg<br>
atch recoveries averaged 46%. A batch size of 10,000 eggs per rim was selected for CTM manufacturing as a conservative limit in this step of the development process.<br>
Temperature<br>
[00172]	Development runs CAZO15 through CAZ022 were performed using<br>
ultracentrifuge rotor set point temperature either at 4°C or 14°C. With one exception, the development runs at 14°C were also run at larger scale than typical (20,000 eggs per batch). In general these batches had lower recoveries of live virus, however this could be due to centrifuge loading rather that temperature effects. In view of the better results at 4°C and the possibility of increased microbial growth rates at higher temperatures, a temperature of 4°C was selected as the ultracentrifuge temperature set point at this point in the development of the process.<br>
Clinical Trial 1 (CTM-I)<br>
[00173]	The monovalent virus lots for CTM-I were produced and included<br>
monovalent bulk lots CAZ025 through CAZ034. In-process QC assay results for the CTM-I monovalent bulk lots are presented in Figure 3 and herein. Average step yields per strain are presented in Figure 3 and herein. Results are summarized below.<br>
[00174]	Potency: The potencies (logi0TCID50mL) of B/Harbin and A/Beijing<br>
virus harvest lots were equal or greater than 8.1. A/Sydney ranged from 7.5 to 8.8 except for CAZ030, which showed very low liter (6.0) because of yolk contamination in the harvest. The titer of the monovalent bulk for A/Beijing was 9.3 or above, for B/Harbin the titer ranged from 8.4 to 9.85 and for A/Sydney ranged from 7.9 to 8.6 (excluding CAZ030). For CAZ030 the titer was below the acceptable level for blending as discussed below.<br>
[00175]	Process Yield: Process yields for each lot are referenced in the<br>
Figures and discussed further herein. Process yields were not corrected for sampling losses. A/Beijing had an average overall process yield of 16% (163 doses/egg), A/Sydney had an average yield of 13% (6 doses/egg), and B/Harbin had an average yield of 93% (86 doses/egg). See figures. The erratic yield estimates reflect assay variability as well as the aclual process performance. In particular, the B/Harbin<br>
results were skewed upward by a very high estimate of Lot CAZ028 monovalent bulk titer (resulting in estimated 252% process yield and 246 doses/egg). The diluted peak pool titer in this case was determined at 0.95 logs higher than the centrifuge peak pool, though a decline would be expected due to dilution. Likewise the filtered monovalent bulk titer was higher than the prefiltered material, which can be accounted for by assay variability. The other two B/Harbin lots, (CAZ026 and CAZ027) had process yields of 20% and 8% respectively, and an egg yield of 7 doses/egg for both lots. The trivalent blends that included bulk lot CAZ028 (CBF1 004 and CBF1 007) resulted in B/Harbin potencies in final product sprayers that were 0.6 and 0.4 iOg,o TCID50 per dose. This further suggests that the CAZ028 monovalent bulk titer was overestimated.<br>
[00176]	Bioburden and Endotoxin:  Virus harvest,   stabilized  harvest and<br>
diluted centrifuge peak fractions were tested for bioburden. Bioburden test results do not give a clear picture of organism loads through the process: test results on virus harvest and diluted centrifuge peak fraction pool samples consisted primarily of "none detected" (eight readings); or " 100 cfu/mL" (ten readings) with only two intermediate values. Endotoxin values for the monovalent bulks varied from 
[00177]	Sucrose  Concentration: The centrifuge peak  fraction pools  had<br>
sucrose concentrations ranging from 39 to 43.5% (CAZ030 was not included in the range). The monovalent bulks had an average sucrose concentration of 7.6%.<br>
[00178]	The monovalent bulk release assay results  are presented  in the<br>
figures. All of the CTM-I lots except for CAZ030 (which was not tested) passed the bulk release assays.<br>
[00179]	SDS-PAGE Analysis: Monovalent bulks were further characterized<br>
by 10% SDS-PAGE gels stained with Gel Code Blue. Based on the calculated protein molecular weights and number of copies per particle for influenza A and B strains, gel bands in the region of 50-60kDa (HAlprotein), 56kDa (NP protein) and 27kDa (Mlprotein) would be expected to be prominent in gels of purified influenza virus. Ha2 protein (23 to 30kD) may also be present.<br>
[00180]	SDS-PAGE   gels   for  A/Beijing/262/95    CAZ031,   and   33   and<br>
A/Sydney/05/97 CAZ029, 30, and 34 were compared.  The range of resolution for the<br>
10% gels was nominally 200-3IkDa. Because of this limitation, interpretation of HA1 protein (23-3OkDa) and M protein bands (21-27kDA) should be made with caution.<br>
[00181]	For A/Beijing and A/Sydney monovalent bulk (MB) lots, a dark<br>
band was observed in the expected region of NP protein (just above the 55kDa marker) for the A/Beijing samples, and a band was seen just above 116 kDa for both strains. Both strains contained a band near the gel front (below 3IkD) consistent with M protein. The HA1 band expected at or just above the 66kD marker was less strong, possibly due to heterogeneity in glycoprotein molecular weight resulting in a more dispersed banding pattern. Staining of the putative NP1 protein also seems to be diminished. For the A/Sydney samples a wider variety of bands were observed, consistent with a greater proportion of egg protein in the monovalent bulk.<br>
[00182]	Doses per Lot and Egg: The dose calculation for all three strains<br>
was based on a 0.24mL average fill volume containing 1.2E+07 TCID50 particles. Based on the dose calculation above, the A/Beijing monovalent lots had an average of 1,576,022 total doses per lot. Average total doses per lot for B/Harbin and A/Sydney were 601,446 and 50,825 doses per lot respectively, or 38% and 3.2% of the average A/Beijing total doses per lot respectively. These results translate to the following values for monovalent doses per egg: 163 doses/egg for A/Beijing, 86 doses/egg for B/Harbin-like and 6 doses/egg for A/Sydney. The calculation for doses/egg was based on the total number of eggs harvested to manufacture the lot.<br>
[00183]	Summary <f egg yields: a had the highest average harvest></f>
volume per egg yield, followed by A/Beijing and B/Harbin. The yield per egg averaged 5.6 mL/egg for B/Harbin, 6.5 mL/egg for A/Beijing, and 6.8 mL/egg for A/Sydney. The overall yield of viable eggs for production averaged 82%. Egg yields were based on the total number of eggs harvested compared to total number of eggs for production. Percent eggs rejected pre-inoculation averaged 10%. Percent rejection post-incubation averaged 5%, with the exception of CAZ028, which had a 29% rejection rate.<br>
[00184]	Purification  Yield Summary (TCID50): Clarified harvest potency<br>
values were higher than the starting material for some of the lots, resulting in step yields greater than 100%. Step yield estimates are affected by the variability of the<br>
TCIDs0 assay, which had a standard deviation above 0.3 logio TCID5o/mL as performed at the time of the production runs. In addition, the step yield at the Diluted Centrifuge Pak Fraction Pool step varies widely for all three strains and is greater than 100% for all ten CTM lots. This appears to be due to a systematic downward bias of titers for Centrifuge Peak Fraction Pools (as suggested by the &gt;100 yield of the next step), thought to be related to the high sucrose levels in these samples.<br>
Comments on CTM-I lots<br>
[00185]	hi the various embodiments and example herein it is preferable that<br>
no yolk contamination take place of the harvest fluids which could occur, e.g., with improper harvest machine settings.<br>
[00186]	0.2 micron filtration step: The batch record in effect specified a Pall<br>
Kleenpak disposable filter, however this was not used for any CTM lots. Lots CAZ025 - 030 used a cartridge filter (AB1DFL7PH4 - Pall hydrophilic PVDF Fluorodyne II filter) with housing instead of the Kleenpak. The filters had similar materials of construction (hydrophilic PVDF), however the filter areas were 5100 cm2 for the Fluorodyne II cartridge filter vs. 1500 cm2 for the Kleenpak Fluorodyne II filter. For lots CAZ03 1/032/033/034 a disposable Pall NovaSip C3DFLP1 filter assembly was used instead of the Kleenpak. The membrane surface area for the C3DFLP1 filter was the same as the Kleenpak filter (1500 cm2).<br>
[00187]	Temperature  excursions:   During the second  incubation  step for<br>
CAZ031, the temperature rose to 34.4°C for 13 hours and for CAZ032 the temperature dropped to 3 l.5°C for 4 hours. These lots reached normal harvest titers above 9.0 loglO TCID50/mL, so the excursions were not regarded as having impacted the product.<br>
Summary<br>
[00188]	Based on two Clinical Trial Manufacturing Campaigns (CTM-I and<br>
CTM-2), the liquid FluMist process development and manufacturing work indicates that the process is suitable to produce clinical supplies that pass release specifications.<br>
ggregate data from both CTM runs and various development studies leads to the following estimates of median process yield:<br>
Clarification: 50% yield<br>
Ultracentrifuge purification: 50% yield<br>
Peak dilution and sterile filtration: 20 to 50% yield<br>
Example 2 Stability testing<br>
[00189]	A trivalent vaccine formulation was prepared   comprising three<br>
different reassortant influenza viruses (7.0 +/- 0.5 log i0 FFU/dose [approximately 7.0 +/- 0.5 log ioTCID5o/dose]) and comprising 200 mM sucrose; 1% (w/v) porcine gelatin hydrolysate; 1.21% (w/v) arginine monohydrocloride [equivalent to 1% (w/v) arginine base]; and 5 mM monosodium glutamate in 100 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2). The stability of the formulation was stored at -25.0 degrees C +/- 5.0 degrees for greater than or equal to 24 hours, but less than or equal to two weeks and then stored at 2-8 degrees C for various time periods. This formulation (e.g., lot 0141500003) was determined to be stable for at least 12 weeks at 4-8 degree C. In particular, the potency for each strain of virus remained within 0.5 log io of the beginning potency prior to 4-8 degree C storage.<br>
[00190]	Other studies have shown that equivalent formulations (comprising<br>
three different reassortant influenza viruses (7.0 +/- 0.5 log i0 FFU/dose [approximately 7.0 +/- 0.5 log io TCID50/dose]) and comprising 200 mM sucrose; 1% (w/v) porcine gelatin hydrolysate; 1.21% (w/v) arginine monohydrocloride [equivalent to 1% (w/v) arginine base]; and 5 mM monosodium glutamate in 100 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2) of different clinical lots (e.g., "Campaign 3") are stable for about 12-15 months at 5.0 (+/- 3.0) degrees C.<br>
[00191]	Subsequent studies have shown that formulations comprising only<br>
200 mM sucrose; 1% (w/v) gelatin hydrolysate; 1.21% (w/v) arginine monohydrocloride [equivalent to 1% (w/v) arginine base] in 100 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, but without glutamate, had equivalent stability as the above formulations with glutamate.<br>
