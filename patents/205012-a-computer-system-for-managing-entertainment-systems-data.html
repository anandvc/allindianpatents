COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10; rule 13]<br>
"A COMPUTER SYSTEM FOR MANAGING ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEMS DATA"<br>
INTEL CORPORATION, a company incorporated in the State of Delaware, United States of America, of 2200 Mission College Boulevard, Santa Clara, California 95052, United States of America,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br><br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to the field of entertainment systems. Specifically, the present invention relates to graphical user interfaces (GUI) in entertainment systems that display entertainment system data.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
A current trend in the electronics and computer industry is the convergence of computer systems and more traditional entertainment system components. As this convergence continues, more components in these systems will be combined together resulting in an increase in the number of entertainment selections and entertainment system data made available to users.<br>
Current mechanisms for storing and providing entertainment system data to users are component specific. For example, programming guides made available by many cable companies provide some entertainment sysicm data relating to entertainment selections available to the users. Typically, the programming guides provide an on-screen display of programming information for channels supported by the cable system. The programming guides, however, do not store or display entertainment system data from sources other than the cable company to the user. Thus, for example, if a user's entertainment system includes a digital satellite system (DSS), a vertical blanking interval (VBI) decoder, a modem, a network connection, or a video library, the entertainment system data from these entertainment selection would not be available to the user on the cable system's programming guide. In addition, the programming guides typically display limited information about an entertainment selection. The information is usually limited to the title of the entertainment selection, the time it is broadcasted, and the channel broadcasting the entertainment selection. The information is typically presented in a static text format. SUMMARY<br>
A method for managing entertainment system data is disclosed. A record corresponding to a first entertainment selection that is selected is obtained. A selectable identifier corresponding to a first set of entertainment system data in the record is<br><br><br>
presented on a display device. A search for a second entertainment selection having a corresponding second set of entertainment system data related to the first set of entertainment system data is performed when the selectable identifier is selected. A result of the search is presented on the display device. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING  DRAWINGS<br>

When selected, the query interface 313 performs the instructions stored in the data portion of the tenth set of entertainment system data 521. The instructions may, for example, direct the query interface 313 to search the data base 320 for other entertainment selections which are related to the data portion of the sixth set of entertainment system data 517.<br><br>
The data parser 311 (shown in Figure 3), the data engine 312 (shown in Figure 3), and the query interface 313 may be implemented using any known circuitry or any known technique. In an embodiment of the present invention where the system control agent 310 is implemented in hardware, the data parser 311, the data engine 312, and the query interface 313 all reside on single semiconductor substrate.<br>
Figure 6 illustrates a graphical user interface 600 for an electronic programming guide according to an embodiment of the present invention. The graphical user interface 600 includes an entertainment category display section 610 that lists the categories of entertainment system data that may be displayed by the graphical user interface 600. The graphical user interface 600 includes a selection listing area 622 that displays the names of entertainment selections that are broadcasted, a time heading 620 that displays the times that the entertainment selections are broadcasted, and a source heading 621 that displays the sources of the entertainment selections all in a grid format. The graphical user interface 600 also includes scroll bars 611 and 612 and a day of the week selection bar 613 to allow a user to browse the entertainment system data stored in the database 320. According to an embodiment of the present invention, sections of the selection listing area 622 corresponding to an entertainment selection may be selected by a user. When selected, the query interface (shown in Figure 3) generates a second graphical user interface that displays additional entertainment system data corresponding to the entertainment selection.<br>
Figure 7 illustrates the second graphical user interface 700 according to an embodiment of the present invention. The second graphical user interface 700 includes a first display area 710 or a "synopsis box" that displays additional entertainment system data related to an entertainment selection corresponding to the section of the selection listing area 622 that is selected. According to this example, the first display area 710 displays a plurality of entertainment system data in text form. The entertainment system data 711-717 include information about the name of the entertainment selection, rating of the entertainment selection, number of stars given to the entertainment selection, genre of the entertainment selection, cast of the entertainment selection, and a synopsis of the entertainment selection. The first display area 710 also uniquely presents entertainment system data that are linked. The entertainment system data that are linked are shown in Figure 7 to be presented with underlining. In this example, the entertainment system data corresponding to the title<br><br>
711, and actors 712, and 713 are linked. It should be appreciated that the entertainment system data that are linked may also be presented using a multimedia identifier, or a font, color, or other unique format that distinguishes it from other entertainment system data that are not linked. The entertainment system data that are linked are presented as user selectable identifiers.<br>
The graphical user interface 700 may optionally include a second display area 720 or second synopsis box. The second display area 720 may include additional entertainment system data related to the entertainment selection including date, source,' and duration information of the entertainment selection.<br>
When selected, the selectable identifiers 711,712, and 713 prompt the query interface 313 (shown in Figure 3) to access and deliver additional entertainment system data related to the identifier. For example, if selectable identifier 711 is selected, a video clip of the entertainment selection may be accessed and played on a display area such as the second display area 720 or other display area on the display device. Alternatively, if the selectable identifier 712 corresponding to a first actor is selected, a search of entertainment selections that will be broadcasted in which the first actor has starred in may be performed and the result of the search may be displayed on the second display area 720 or other display area on the display device. Figure 8 illustrates the results of the search as displayed in the second display area 720.<br>
Figure 9 is a block diagram of a synopsis box builder 900 according to an embodiment of the present invention. The synopsis box builder 900 resides in the query interface 313 (shown in Figure 3). The synopsis box builder 900 includes a user interface unit 910. The user interface unit 910 communicates with the wireless communications interface unit 234 (shown in Figure 2) and receives input selections received by the wireless communication interface unit 234. The user interface unit 910 may for example receive an identity of a section of the selection listing area 622 (shown in Figure 6) that is selected by a user. The section of the selection listing area 622 selected indicates an entertainment selection selected by the user.<br>
A database interface unit 920 is coupled to the user interface unit 910. The database interface unit 920 receives an identity of the entertainment selection selected by the user and searches the database 320 (shown in Figure 3) for a record corresponding to the entertainment selection. The record includes entertainment system data related to the entertainment selection selected.<br><br>
A synopsis box building unit 930 is coupled to the database interface unit 930. The synopsis box building unit 930 displays the entertainment system data related to the entertainment selection in a display area of a display device. According to an embodiment of the present invention, the display area is a separate window or "synopsis box" on the display area. The synopsis box building unit 930 may present the entertainment system data in text form or as selectable identifiers.<br>
According to an embodiment of the present invention, a set of entertainment system data that is linked to other entertainment system data is presented by the synopsis building unit 930 as a selectable identifier. When the selectable identifier is selected, the database interface unit 920 accesses a data portion in the set of entertainment system data that is linked and executes the instructions stored in the data portion. The instructions may include instructions that require data to be retrieved from the database 320 (shown in Figure 3) or other location and displayed on the display device. The instructions may also include instructions that require a search be performed in the database 320 or other location and the results of the search displayed on the display device.<br>
Figure 10 is a flow chart illustrating a method for managing entertainment system data according to an embodiment of the present invention. At step 1001, a record corresponding to a first entertainment selection that is selected is obtained. According to an embodiment of the present invention, obtaining the record corresponding to the first entertainment selection is achieved by referencing an entertainment selection identifier of the first entertainment selection in a database.<br>
At step 1002, a selectable identifier corresponding to a first set of entertainment system data in the record is displayed on a display device. According to an embodiment of the present invention, presenting the selectable identifier corresponding to the first set of entertainment system data in the record on the display device is achieved by generating an identifier that is distinguishable from non-selectable text.<br>
At step 1003, a search for a second entertainment selection having a corresponding second set of entertainment system data related to the first set of entertainment system, data is performed when the selectable identifier is selected. According to an embodiment of the present invention, performing the search for a second entertainment selection with the corresponding second set of entertainment<br><br>
system data related to the first set of entenainment system data is achieved by searching entertainment system data in the database.<br>
At step 1004, a result of the search is presented on the display device.<br>
In the foregoing description, the invention is described with reference to specific exemplary embodiments thereof. It will, however, be evident that various modifications and changes may be made thereto without departing from the broader spirit and scope of the present invention as set forth in the appended claims. The specification and drawings arc accordingly to be regarded in an illustrative rather than'a restrictive sense.   <br><br>
