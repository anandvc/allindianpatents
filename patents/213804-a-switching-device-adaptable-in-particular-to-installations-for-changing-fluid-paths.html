				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention generally relates to a fitting for controlling and changing<br>
fluid paths of the brine in osmosis installations. More particularly, the invention<br>
relates to a switching device adaptable to installations for changing fluid paths.<br>
BACKGROUND OF INVENTION<br>
For the purpose of treating water, the reverse osmesis process is often used. In<br>
this case a fluid stream to be purified is forced at high pressure through a<br>
membrane system which, in the case of large quantities of fluid, comprises a<br>
plurality of membrane modules. In such membrane modules, separation into<br>
pure water and an enriched concentrate is carried out through a membrane,<br>
since only some of a fluid to be purified can flow through a membrane. The<br>
proportion flowing through emerges as a usable proportion, as pure water or<br>
else permeate, on the other side of the membrane. The part which does not flow<br>
through leaves a membrane module as brine, a concentrate of the fluid enriched,<br>
with salts and minerals, as a proportion which cannot be used and is under high<br>
pressure. This pressure is around 2 bar with a module inlet pressure of about 65<br>
bar.<br>
US 5 306 428 discloses a reverse osmosis insolation in which pressure<br>
exchangers in the form of tubular chambers are used to recover energy. By using<br>
these, the still high pressure of the high energy brine flowing out of the<br>
membrane module is transferred to a fluid still to be purified. Thus, a pump drive<br>
output which is lower by the amount of this pressure increase is required for the<br>
fluid to be fed in order to generate the high pressure needed for the reverse<br>
osmosis process.<br>
For the purpose of controlling and/or changing over the fluid paths of the brine<br>
into and out of the pressure exchangers, a fitting with a rotating closing element<br>
is used, in addition to other fittings. With the aid of said fitting, the tubular<br>
chambers of the pressure exchangers have brine emerging from the membrane<br>
modules applied to them alternatively. The rotating closing element is<br>
constructed as a roll, in which connecting ducts are arranged in the manner of a<br>
3-way valve. During the changeover operations, all the flow paths are shut off<br>
completely. In order to avoid pressure surges during such changeover<br>
operations pressure equalizing ducts are arranged within the roll.<br>
Depending on the operating period of a membrane, its separation capability<br>
decreases and a fluid to be purified has to remain for a correspondingly longer<br>
time within a membrane module. For this reason, in the prior art, the changeover<br>
times of the roll are influenced with the aid of an actuating motor. However, this<br>
fitting is suitable only for small reverse osmosis installations, since the flow cross<br>
sections within the fitting are approximately the same size as the flow cross<br>
sections of the ducts to be filled. In the case of large installations and the fluid<br>
columns to be displaced therein, and as a result of the forces necessitated<br>
thereby, a considerable problem of dimensioning the fitting arises.<br>
GB patent 761690 discloses an apparatus for distributing fluid. The invention<br>
provides a valve apparatus for the distribution of a fluid, particularly compressed<br>
air, to a plurality of fluid-operated devices such as jacks, which comprises<br>
a fluid-tight stack of fixed plates, each of which has at least two conduits for<br>
connection to jacks or like devices and an exhaust conduit, such plates defining<br>
between them chambers, which communicate with each other and with a source<br>
of fluid by connection of the latter to one of the chambers, and co-operating with<br>
a plurality of distributing discs carried by a rotatable shaft, each of which discs is<br>
applied plastically against one of the fixed plates and co-operates with it to<br>
ensure an adjustable connection between the source of fluid and the conduits in<br>
such plate.<br>
US patent 3752167 describes a rotary valve having a stationary member formed<br>
therein with a plurality of fluid passages and a rotary member formed therein<br>
with at least one channel adapted to communicate one of said fluid passages to<br>
another therethrough upon rotation of said rotary member. To facilitate a<br>
satisfactory smooth rotation of said rotary member in contact with the stationary<br>
member, both the stationary member and the rotary member are made of<br>
materials of dissimilar quality having relatively higher and lower hardness,<br>
respectively, and, in addition thereto, the contact surfaces there of are polished<br>
very accurately.<br>
OBJECTS OF INVENTION<br>
It is therefore an object of the invention to propose a switching device adaptable<br>
to installations for changing fluid paths, in particular for large osmosis<br>
installations.<br>
Another object of the invention is to propose a switching device which is capable<br>
of distributing large flow of fluid between different pressure exchangers in a<br>
simple and fault-free manner.<br>
A further object of the invention is to propose a switching device which is<br>
accurately dimensioned to generate the forces required to displace large fluid<br>
columns in larger installations,<br>
SUMMARY OF INVENTION<br>
Accordingly, there is provided a switching device adaptable, in particular to<br>
installations for changing fluid paths, the installation comprising pressure<br>
exchangers with tubular chambers having at least a first and a second tubular<br>
network system, through which fluid flow takes place alternately, the device<br>
comprising a rotatable closing and distributing element arranged inside a<br>
housing, the housing having a plurality of connections for connecting the lines of<br>
the tubular network systems, and the closing and distributing element being<br>
provided with a motor-operated drive shaft, a flow splitter provided with a<br>
plurality of transfer paths is arranged within the housing, in that openings of the<br>
transfer paths are configured at two axial ends including the circumference of<br>
the flow splitter, and in that a rotating, disk-like control element is arranged in a<br>
sealing manner at each end of the flow splitter as a closing element.<br>
The solution to this program provides for a flow splitter provided with a plurality<br>
of transfer paths to be arranged within the housing, far openings of the transfer<br>
paths to be arranged within the housing, for openings of the transfer paths to be<br>
arranged at two axial ends and on the circumference of the flow splitter, and for<br>
a rotating, disk-like control element to be arranged in a sealing manner at each<br>
end of the flow splitter. Thus, in the case of such fluid flows which are to be<br>
controlled and which change direction periodically, a changeover with few<br>
pressure surges can be achieved.<br>
Refinements of the invention provide for the end regions of the flow splitter<br>
inside the housing to be connected to the tubular chambers in which a pressure<br>
exchange is carried out with the aid of the changing fluid flows. In each case a<br>
connection for a supply of high pressure fluid and a discharge of low pressure<br>
fluid are arranged on the housing of the fitting, in the circumferential region of<br>
the flow splitter and on the housing. What is known as brine under high<br>
pressure, HPB, for example, flows to the fitting through the connection for a high<br>
pressure fluid. Following pressure transmission, the brine then flows in<br>
depressurized form, as what is known as LPB, out of the housing through the<br>
discharge for low pressure fluid.<br>
In the fiow splitter there are arranged flow paths with the aid of which the flows<br>
having different pressures are distributed. In this case, within the flow splitter,<br>
two outer flow paths are connected to a high pressure side and a central flow<br>
path, arranged between the former, is connected to a low pressure side. In order<br>
to ensure long-term operating reliability under the continuously changing<br>
pressure loadings, one or more reinforcing elements can additional be arranged<br>
in one or more of the flow paths. This depends on the physical configuration of<br>
the flow splitter and the materials used.<br>
The flow splitter can be an integral constituent part of the housing; it has been<br>
shown to be advantageous if the flow splitter is constructed as a housing insert.<br>
In this way, housing fabrication is simplified and the number of sealing points<br>
located on the housing can be reduced. It has likewise proven to be<br>
advantageous wit regard to the closing behavior if the flow splitter is constructed<br>
as a ceramic or a (ceramic-) coated component.<br>
The control elements are advantageously constructed in the manner of rotating<br>
rotary slide, which means that secure management of the sealing functions is<br>
possible, in addition to simple production. Therefore, a previously known closing<br>
elements is replaced by control elements which act as temporary closing<br>
elements only during their rotation movement. The control elements alternately<br>
control the flow through the overflow paths of the flow splitter, which means<br>
that secure and efficient flow changeover is ensured. Furthermore, the control<br>
elements are provided with control openings located opposite one another in<br>
pairs, which means that a flow of a large amount is achieved in a small space.<br>
With the aid of the refinement in which the control openings of a control element<br>
are arranged to be offset by at most 90° from one another in each case in<br>
relation to the control openings of the other control element, alternating<br>
changeover of the flow direction to the tubular chambers connected to the<br>
housing is carried out in an extremely simple way during a rotational movement<br>
of the control elements.<br>
Since the control elements are subjected to alternating loading in operation, they<br>
are provided with reinforcements on the side facing away from the flow splitter.<br>
It is likewise possible to provide the control elements with reinforcements on<br>
their circumference. These may be additional material masses, built-in<br>
components, supporting elements, tensioning elements and the like. This<br>
depends on the materials used.<br>
In order to reduce the forces between flow splitter and control element, one or<br>
more depression are arranged on the ends of the flow splitter in order to form<br>
narrow bearing surfaces. This measure avoids contact over the entire area, by<br>
which higher frictional forces are caused. Instead, the formation of narrow<br>
contact surfaces is thus possible, which also permit improved sealing at the same<br>
time.<br>
In order to separate different pressure regions in the chambers located in the<br>
housing, seals bear on the control elements on the side facing away from the<br>
flow splitter. These can be of a sliding ring seal design. Apart from the ability to<br>
be produced easily, the advantage of the known secure sealing action is<br>
therefore provided. In addition, the shaft is arranged in a region of the housing<br>
which is shielded by the seals and is connected to the low pressure side LPB. As<br>
a result, the passage of the shaft through the housing wall to the outside<br>
advantageously only has to be sealed by a conventional shaft seal designed for<br>
low pressure. This entails less effort than sealing off such a shaft leadthrough<br>
with respect to the high pressure side HPB. And, within the fitting, as a result no<br>
additional seals are required for the passage of a shaft.<br>
Further refinements provide for a shaft driving the control elements to pass<br>
through the flow splitter and for the control elements to be connected in a force-<br>
transmitting manner to the shaft. This simplifies the mounting and the driving of<br>
the control elements. The control elements are constructed as ceramic or coated<br>
components, which provide high resistance to wear and attack by the fluid flows<br>
to be controlled.<br>
Mounting and maintenance are made considerably easier if flow splitter, shaft<br>
and control elements are all constructed as a housing insert. Thus, serviceability<br>
can be ensured in an extremely short time. And, as a result of the arrangement<br>
of sealing zones arranged on the circumference of the flow splitter between inlet<br>
and outlet, overflow between these two zones is avoided.<br>
For a gentle changeover, provision is made for the tubular chambers of the<br>
pressure converter to be connected to one another briefly by the position and<br>
the size of the control openings during a movement of the rotary slide. The<br>
position and the size of the control openings on the control elements constructed<br>
as rotary slides permits a flow changeover which is free of pressure surges, since<br>
a simultaneous connection to a supply of high pressure fluid is thereby always<br>
ensured. Closing a control opening of a connected tubular chamber is at the<br>
same time connected with opening of another previously closed control opening<br>
of a further tubular chamber and vice versa. Because of the enlarged control<br>
openings and because of their position on the control element, an overlap with<br>
the flow openings arranged fixedly in the flow splitter is achieved. Such an<br>
overlap in this case has a beneficial effect on the changeover and the behavior of<br>
the flowing fluid columns affected thereby.<br>
Depending on the flow rate of the pressure converter, the position of the control<br>
openings is changed at a continuous and/or discontinuous speed. The decree to<br>
which the tubular chambers are filled can therefore be influenced. The use of a<br>
discontinuous speed permits a longer residence time of the flow openings over<br>
the control openings, utilizing the full opening cross section. The discontinuous<br>
movement achieves greater channel filling in a shorter time and thus a maximum<br>
possible flow rate. This can be done with the aid of an appropriately designed<br>
drive motor. When a conventional rotary drive with continuous movement of the<br>
control elements is used, the same device can also be used for small<br>
installations, since a smaller flow rate is switched therewith. Conversely, with a<br>
discontinuous movement of the control elements, at a given flow rate the overall<br>
volume of the device can be reduced. With the aid of adjustable switching times<br>
of the control elements, the volume throughput can be influenced as a function<br>
of the pressure differences present.<br>

DETAIL DESCRIPTION OF A PREFERRED EMBODIMENT OF<br>
INVENTION<br>
A fitting 1 is shown in section in figure la. The housing 2 has two connections 3,<br>
4 with the aid of which a connection to the tube chambers, not illustrated, from<br>
a pressure exchanger system is made. By means of the connections 3, 4, an<br>
exchange of a fluid which flows through under high pressure and flows back at<br>
lower pressure is made alternately. Arrows 5, 6 show the respectively prevailing<br>
flow directions. The distance between the connections 3, 4 is chosen in<br>
accordance with the distance between tubular chambers to be connected<br>
thereto. This integration of the connections 3, 4 into the housing 2 avoids<br>
unnecessary additional sealing points.<br>
Arranged inside the housing 2 is a flow splitter 7 which, in the exemplary<br>
embodiment shown, is configured as a separate insert. It can equally well be<br>
configured as a single-piece component with the housing 2. The flow splitter 7,<br>
formed as an insert here, is sealed off respect to the housing 2 with the aid of<br>
seals 8. In the region of the circumference of the flow splitter 7 there is arranged<br>
a chamber 9, which is used to discharge a depressurized fluid. In each case a<br>
control element 12, 13 bears in a sealing manner on the ends 10, 11 and is set<br>
rotating with the aid of a shaft 14 driven by a motor, not illustrated. The force is<br>
transmitted between shaft 14 and the control elements 12, 13 by means of<br>
bearing elements 15. These can be configured as polygons or force-fitting and<br>
form-fitting in another way. The shaft 14 is mounted in the interior of the<br>
housing 2 at one end and, on the opposite side, is mounted and sealed off in a<br>
cover 16 which doses the housing 2.<br>
The rotating control elements 12, 13, which are configured in the manner of<br>
rotary sides here, have reinforcements 12.1 to 13.2. These reinforcements<br>
improve the alternating bending loading of the control elements 12,1 3 during<br>
the changeover operation. Depending on the materials used, that is to say metal<br>
or ceramic or combinations thereof, these reinforcements can be formed as<br>
accumulations of material, plates, rings, struts or the like.<br>
In the illustrated of figure 1, a fluid under high pressure, for example a high<br>
pressure brine HPB, flows from two T-shaped flow paths 17, 18 through control<br>
openings 19, 20 arranged opposite one another in pairs and belonging to the<br>
control element 13 into an end region 21 of the housing 2 and from there, via<br>
the connection 4, to a tubular chamber. At the same instant, a fluid under low<br>
pressure, for example a low pressure brine LPB, flows through the connection 3<br>
from a tubular chamber into the end region 22 of the housing 2.<br>
Seals 23 bearing on each control element 12, 13 prevent fluid exchange with<br>
other housing regions. The seals 23 are constructed in the manner of a sliding<br>
ring seal, held in the housing 2 so as to be secured against rotation, and bear in<br>
a sealing manner on the control elements 12, 13 under the pressure of springs<br>
24.<br>
Figure 1b corresponds to the exemplary embodiment of figure la in terms of the<br>
instantaneous position of the control elements in relation to the flow splitter.<br>
However, a section rotated through 90° is shown in figure lb. It reveals that, of<br>
the control element 12, the control openings 25, 26 arranged in pairs are<br>
connected in a fluid-carrying manner to a flow path 27 which is arranged in the<br>
center of the flow splitter 7. The central flow path 27, designed for an outward<br>
flow of a low pressure fluid identified by LPB, is arranged between the two flow<br>
paths 17, 18 designed for a high pressure fluid HPB. In order to manage the<br>
altematingly occurring forces securely, a reinforcing element 29 of a transverse<br>
rib type is arranged in the flow path 27. This ensures a beneficial flow of force<br>
within the flow splitter 7.<br>
A low pressure fluid led through the connection 3 into the housing 2 flows via the<br>
control opening 25, 26 into the flow path 27 and from there flows out of the<br>
housing as low pressure fluid via an opening 28 in the flow splitter 7 and an<br>
outlet 30. Arranged opposite the outlet 30 on the housing 2 is a connection 31<br>
for the supply of high pressure fluid HPB to the housing 2, With the aid of he<br>
chamber 32 arranged on the circumference of the flow splitter 7, the high<br>
pressure fluid is led to the two T-shaped flow paths 17 and 18. With the aid of<br>
the low pressure chamber 9 arranged opposite, the low pressure fluid is<br>
discharged from the housing 2 via the outlet 30.<br>
Figures 2a and 2b show the same sections through the fitting as figures la and<br>
1b in a second operating state. In this case, the control elements 12 and 13 have<br>
been rotated onward through 90° in each case via the shaft 14 and the bearing<br>
elements 15. The fluid HPB flowing into the flow paths 17, 18 through the high<br>
pressure connection 31 and the chamber 32 is deflected via the control openings<br>
25, 26 into the chamber 22, from where it passes via the connection 3 to a<br>
tubular chamber (not illustrated). At the same time, low pressure fluid LPB flows<br>
via the connection 4 from a second tubular chamber into the chamber 21,<br>
through the control openings 19, 20 into the central flow path 27 in the flow<br>
splitter 7 and from there out of the fitting via the opening 28, the chamber 9 and<br>
the connection 30. By means of further rotation of the parts 12, 13, 14 and 15<br>
through 90°, the first operating state, illustrated in figures la and lb, is then<br>
reached again.<br>
Figure 3a shows a perspective view of the flow splitter 7 with a central flow path<br>
27, and figure 3b shows, by means of a partial section in the flow splitter 7, the<br>
position of the outer flow paths 17 and 18 still located therein. In the central flow<br>
path 27 there is a reinforcing element 29, in which there is an opening for the<br>
shaft 14 to be led through. Furthermore, a plurality of depressions 33 is made in<br>
the end 11 of the flow splitter 7, which means that narrow bearing surfaces 34<br>
are formed on the end face 11. This reduces the frictional forces between the<br>
parts sliding on one another and at the same time improves the sealing action.<br>
The T-shaped course of the flow paths 17, 18 ensures in the simplest way that<br>
an alternating outflow of a high pressure fluid into the respectively connected<br>
tubular chamber becomes possible as a result of the control openings 19, 20; 25,<br>
26 sliding alternately past. A fluid flows out of the central flow path 27 to the<br>
outside via an opening 28 and via the outlet 30 from the housing 2.<br>
Figures 4a and 4b show a perspective arrangement of the functional parts in the<br>
form of the flow splitter 7, the control elements 12, 13, the shaft 14 and the<br>
bearing elements 15 of the fitting 1, in each case in partial section. Here, figure<br>
4a shows the first operating state and figure 4b the second operating state with<br>
the parts 12, 13, 14 and 15 rotated through 90° in each case with respect to the<br>
flow splitter 7. In figure 4a it becomes clear how, in a first operating state, the<br>
high pressure fluid HPB flows through the flow paths 17, 18 and the contra<br>
openings 19, 20 to the side at the front in this view. At the same time, on the<br>
other side or, here, the rear side, the path via the central flow path 27 to the<br>
opening 28 is free via the flow rate openings 25, 26 arranged in pairs, the latter<br>
being hidden.<br>
In the second operating state, shown in figure 4b, the relationships in the<br>
converse state are illustrated. For this purpose, the control elements 12, 13 are<br>
shown as having been rotated through 90° with respect to the fiow splitter 7 with<br>
the aid of the shaft 14 and the bearing elements 15. In this view of the<br>
drawings, a high pressure fluid HPB flows rearward via the flow openings 25, 26<br>
of the control element 12. At the same time, via the flow openings 19, 20<br>
likewise arranged in pairs (19 has been cut away by the partial sectional<br>
illustration), a depressurized low pressure fluid LPB passes from the front side of<br>
the view of the drawing into the central flow path 27 and flows out of the fitting<br>
from there via the opening 28.<br>
By means of this solution having the control elements 12, 13 arranged on both<br>
sides of a flow splitter 7, an extremely compact changeover fitting with high<br>
operational reliability is provided. At the same time, the number of sealing points<br>
and pipeline connections needed for such a fitting could be reduced to a<br>
minimum.<br>
We Claim<br>
1. A switching device (1) adaptable, in particular to installations for changing<br>
fluid paths, the installation comprising pressure exchangers with tubular<br>
chambers having at least a first and a second tubular network system,<br>
through which fluid flow takes place alternately, the device comprising a<br>
rotatable closing and distributing element arranged inside a housing (2),<br>
the housing (2) having a plurality of connections (3, 4) for connecting the<br>
lines of the tubular network systems, and the closing and distributing<br>
element being provided with a motor-operated drive shaft (14),<br>
characterized in that a flow splitter (7) provided with a plurality of transfer<br>
paths (17, 18, 27) is arranged within the housing (2), in that openings of<br>
