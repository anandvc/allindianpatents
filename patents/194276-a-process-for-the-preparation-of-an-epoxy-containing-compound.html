				<td>The present invention pertains to a process for the preparation of epoxy-containing compounds without the use of halogenated intermediates.<br>
It is well-known to prepare epoxy compounds by reacting epihalohydrin with an active-hydrogen--containing compound and subsequently dehydrohalogenating the chlorohydrin intermediate product with a basic acting compound such as an alkali or alkaline earth metal hydroxide or carbonate.  The five-step process from propylene to epoxy resin is usually as follows:<br>
1)	propylene + chlorine 	&gt; allyl chloride<br>
2)	allyl chloride + water + chlorine 	&gt;<br>
dichloropropanol<br>
3)	dichloropropanol + base 	&gt; epichlorohydrin<br>
4)	epichlorohydrin + active-hydrogen-containing<br>
compound such as a*bisphenol 	&gt; chlorohydrin<br>
intermediate<br>
5)	chlorohydrin intermediate + basic acting compound<br>
	&gt; glycidyl ether epoxy resin<br>
The process uses organohalide intermediates and makes a substantial quantity of organohalide by-products, which require special handling.<br>
EPO Publication 0 368 421 A2 (16-May-90) has proposed the following alternative synthesis to make epoxy resins:<br><br>
(1)	reacting methallyl halide with a polyhydric phenol to make the poly(allyl ether) of the polyhydric phenol; and<br>
(2)	oxidizing the allyl groups in the poly(allyl ether) to make the poly(glycidyl ether) of the polyhydric phenol.<br>
This process suffers from poor yields and still requires halogen in the process. It is impractical as a route to intermediates and to make commercial quantities of epoxy resin.<br>
Japanese Patent Application 60-124615 to Sumitomo Bakelite teaches the following alternative synthesis to make epoxy resins:<br>
(1)	reacting allyl halide with a polyhydric phenol to make the poly(allyl ether) of the polyhydric phenol; and<br>
(2)	oxidizing the allyl groups in the polyCallyl ether) to make the poly(glycidyl ether) of the polyhydric phenol.<br>
»<br>
'    The products of this process contain high levels of side-products, and the process still requires halogen. It is impractical as a route to intermediates and to make commercial quantities of epoxy resin.<br>
	What is needed is a practical process to make<br>
epoxy resins without resort to halogenated intermediates.<br><br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a process for the preparation of an epoxy-containing compound such as herein described essentially free of organic halides comprising the steps of: (1) providing an allyl reagent selected from an allyl carboxylate or an allyl carbonate; (2) allylating in a known manner one or more compounds such as herein described containing at least one active-hydrogen atom per molecule, in the presence of a transition metal catalyst and optionally in the presence of at least one complexing agent and a base, at a temperature of from -20°C to 250°C, the ratio of the base to active-hydrogen containing compound is 0.8 : 1, wherein the active hydrogen atom is selected from a hydroxyl group, a thiol group, or a primary or secondary aryl amine group with said carboxylate or the allyl carbonate from step (1), whereby an allyl ether, an allyl thioether or an allyl aryl amine compound is formed; and (3) epoxidizing in a known manner the allyl groups on the compound from step (2) to epoxide groups, whereby a glycidyl ether, a glycidyl thioether or a glycidyl aryl amine compound is formed.<br><br><br>
Using preferred embodiments of the present invention, the ultimate production of the epoxy--containing compounds can be accomplished efficiently in three steps starting with the basic raw material, propylene without the use of halogenated organic intermediates (aside from halogens which may be present on the active-hydrogen-containing compound).  A preferred three-step process is summarized as follows:<br>
1)	Propylene + oxygen + carboxylic acid + catalyst 	&gt;<br>
allyl carboxylate;<br>
2)	Allyl carboxylate + active-hydrogen-containing<br>
compound such as a bisphenol 	&gt; allyl derivative<br>
of active-hydrogen-containing compound; and<br>
3)	Allyl derivative of active-hydrogen-containing<br>
compound + peroxy oxidant 	&gt; glycidyl derivative<br>
of active-hydrogen-containing compound.<br>
As a further advantage, the compounds prepared by the process of the present invention may have none or<br><br>
very little total organic halides present except for lalogen introduced by the active-hydrogen-containing compound.  For instance, the process of the present invention is suitable for the preparation of the liglycidyl ether of tetrabromobisphenol A; however, it fill not be essentially free of organic halides because of the bromine present in the tetrabromobisphenol A starting material.  Epoxy resins which contain none or very little total organic halides are particularly suitable for electronic applications, metal primer coatings, cathodic electrodeposition coatings and powder coatings.<br>
The term "catalyst efficiency" or "turnover rate" is defined by the following equation:<br>
(Equivalents of Active Hydrogen<br>
atalyst Efficiency or   _	Converted Formed)<br>
urnover Rate	.<br>
(Mole of Catalyst)/Hour<br>
Step (1) Providing an Allyl Reagent<br>
The allyl reagent used in the present invention is an allyl carboxylate or an allyl carbonate, and is more preferably an allyl carboxylate, and most preferably it is allyl acetate.<br>
The allyl reagent is preferably employed in amounts such that the equivalent ratio of allyl reagent to active-hydrogen atom contained in the active--hydrogen-containing compound is from 0.1:1 to 500:1, more preferably from 0.5:1 to 50:1, and most preferably from 1:1 to 5:1.  At ratios significantly above 1:1, the allyl reagent acts as both a reagent and a solvent.<br><br>
At ratios below 0.1:1, the conversion to the desired product is very low and the excess active--hydrogen-containing reactant must be recovered and recycled in the process.<br>
Allyl Carboxylates<br>
The allyl carboxylates which are useful as allyl reagents are preferably represented by the following Formula I:<br><br>
wherein R1 is hydrogen or an alkyl group having from 1 to 12 carbon atoms which may optionally be linked to another R1 group to form a ring structure, and<br>
R3 is hydrogen or an alkyl, cycloalkyl or aryl group having from 1 to 10 carbon atoms and<br>
"i" equals on average 1 to 3.<br>
Preferably, the allyl carboxylate is allyl formate, allyl acetate, allyl propionate, allyl benzoate, or a diallyl carboxylate such as oxalate, glutarate, succinate, or any combination thereof.  Most preferred as the allyl carboxylate is allyl acetate.<br>
Preparation of Allyl Carboxylates<br>
Certain useful allyl carboxylates, such as allyl acetate, are commercially available.  Allyl<br><br>
carboxylates can also be prepared by the oxidation of propylene or corresponding olefins in the presence of oxygen, a carboxylic acid (such as formic acid, acetic acid or propionic acid) and a palladium catalyst as de scribed in U.S. Patent 3,970,713.  The reaction is conducted at temperatures of from 50°C to 250°C.  In the reaction, from 5 to 20 moles of water per mole of acid, from 1 to 5 moles of oxygen per mole of acid and from 4 to 40 moles of olefin per mole of oxygen are employed. This reaction proceeds readily in one step from the olefin to the allyl carboxylate without the use or production of halogenated materials.<br>
Allyl Carbonates<br>
Suitable allyl carbonates which can be employed herein include, for example, those represented by the following Formula II:<br><br>
wherein R5 is (CR12CR1-CR12 wherein R6 is R5 or a hydrocarbyl radical of up to about 20 carbon atoms, preferably from 1 to 10, more preferably from 1 to 4 carbon atoms; and each Rl is as previously described. Particularly suitable allyl carbonates which can be employed include, for example, diallyl carbonate, dimethallyl carbonate, methyl allyl carbonate, ethyl allyl carbonate, allyl phenol carbonate, or any combination of any two or more of such allyl carbonates.<br><br>
Preparation of Allyl Carbonates<br>
The allyl carbonates can be prepared by reacting dimethyl carbonate or phosgene with allyl alcohol, for instance as described in Woo, U.S. Patent 4,507,492 at Example 9.  For example, allyl methyl carbonate or diallyl carbonate can be generated by reacting at room temperature or below allyl alcohol with dimethyl carbonate in the presence of a catalytic amount of base such as sodium hydroxide, sodium hydride or sodium methoxide, and distilling out methanol being formed during the process.  Allyl methyl carbonate and/or diallyl carbonate prepared in this manner is suitable as the allylation agent.<br>
Step (2) Preparation of the Allyl Derivative of Active--Hydrogen-Containing Compounds<br>
The allyl derivative of the active-hydrogen--containing compound is preferably prepared by reacting an active-hydrogen-containing compound with an allyl carboxylate as the allylating agent in the presence of a transition metal catalyst, optionally but preferably, in the presence of at least one complexing agent for the catalyst and in the presence of at least one base compound and further, optionally but preferably, in the presence of one or more suitable solvents.<br>
The reaction is preferably conducted at a temperature of from 0°C to 200°C, more preferably from 25°C to 150°C, more preferably from 50°C to 110°C, and preferably at a pressure sufficient to keep the reaction mixture in liquid form.  The reaction time to completion is preferably from 0.1 to 72 hours, more preferably from 0.1 to 48 hours, and most preferably from 0.1 to<br><br><br>
24 hours.  Optimum temperature and times for particular reactants will vary depending upon the reactivity of the particular reactants, solvents and catalysts employed; however, such optimum temperatures and times can readily be determined in the laboratory with minimum effort.<br>
At temperatures below about 0°C, the reaction proceeds at a slower rate and costs for cooling are incurred.<br>
At temperatures above about 200°C, costs for providing the increased temperature are incurred.<br>
Particular pressures are not deemed to be determinative of any appreciative effects on the process; however, pressures are preferably employed which will keep the reaction in the liquid phase.<br>
The allyl derivative of the active-hydrogen--containing compound can also be prepared by reacting an active-hydrogen-containing compound with an allyl carbonate as the allyl reagent in the presence of a catalyst such as, for example, ruthenium, rhodium, rhenium, palladium, molybdenum, tungsten, nickel, platinum, or any combination thereof; and optionally in the presence of one or more suitable solvents.  Reaction temperatures are preferably from -20°C to 250°C, more preferably from 20°C to 200°C, and most preferably from 30°C to 120°C.  The reaction time will vary with the temperature and the particular catalyst and amount of catalyst employed; however, suitable reaction times include from 0.1 to 100, preferably from 0.1 to 50, and more preferably from 0.1 to 10 hours.  This process employing phenols, thiophenols and aryl amines as the<br><br>
active-hydrogen-containing compound is described by Edmund P. Woo in U.S. Patent 4,507,492.<br>

Buffering Agents<br>
Strong base compounds such as hydroxides or alkoxides, which are used with allyl carboxylates, are preferably modified with buffering agents such as, for example, alkali or alkaline earth metal bicarbonates, alkali or alkaline earth metal carbonates, carbon dioxide, alkali or alkaline earth metal hydrogen phosphates, or alkali or alkaline earth metal borates. For example, sodium carbonate may be formed in situ  using sodium hydroxide and carbon dioxide.  The buffering agents are preferably employed in amounts such that the pH of the aqueous portion, if any, in the reaction mixture is from 7 to 13, more preferably from 8 to 12, and most preferably from 9 to 11.  As an alternative<br><br>
method to control pH, unbuffered bases may be added continuously or in stages over a period of time.<br>
Catalysts<br>
The reaction of step (2) is preferably run in the presence of a transition metal catalyst.  Suitable catalysts contain, for example, rhodium, ruthenium, rhenium, palladium, iridium, tungsten, molybdenum, chromium, platinum, nickel, copper, osmium, iron, either in an unoxidized state as the free metal or a complex or in an oxidized state as their salts such as, for example, carboxylates, halides, oxides, nitrates or sulfates.

Homogeneous catalysts are preferably employed in amounts of from 0.005 to 200, more preferably from 0.01 to 50, more highly preferably from 0.05 to 10, and most preferably from 0.1 to 2 mrnoles per equivalent of active-hydrogen atom contained in the active-hydrogen--containing compound.  The quantity of homogeneous<br><br>
catalyst is preferably about the minimum required to provide a reaction at the desired speed.<br>
The supported catalyst preferably contains from 0.1 to 80, more preferably from 0.5 to 50, and most preferably from 0.5 to 10 percent by weight catalyst.

The maximum concentration is not critical. When the catalyst is employed as a supported, heterogeneous catalyst, the reaction can be conducted in a fixed bed or suspended in the liquid reaction mixture.<br>
Complexing Agents<br>
Complexing agents are preferably employed to serve as ligands to stabilize and to enhance the activity of the metal catalyst.  The catalyst can be complexed with the complexing agent prior to addition to the reaction mixture or the catalyst complex can be formed in situ by adding the catalyst and the complexing agent separately to the reaction mixture.<br>
Suitable complexing agents include, for example, organic mono- or diphosphines, organic phosphites, organic stibines, oximes, organic arsines, diamines, and dicarbonyl compounds or any combination of any two.

The preferred complexing agents<br><br>
include, tris-tolyl phosphines, triphenyl phosphine and diphenylphosphino ethane with triphenyl phosphine being most preferred.  The complexing ligand may also be supported on a resinous backbone.<br>
Aqueous soluble complexing agents, such as sulfonated triphenylphosphines and their salts, may also be used.  This type of ligand will have the advantage of being water soluble and easily washed out/separated from the organic product layer.<br>
The complexing agents are preferably employed in amounts of from about 10 to 1000, more preferably from 50 to 500, and most preferably from 200 to 400 mole per 100 moles of the catalyst excluding any support material.<br>
Solvents<br>
Suitable solvents which can optionally, but preferably, be employed in step (2) of the present invention include, for example, water, excess amounts of allyl carboxylate, and oxygenated hydrocarbons (such as alcohols, ethers, glycols, glycol ethers, esters and ketones).  Other solvents including nitroalkanes, cyanoalkanes, alkyl sulfoxides, amides, aromatic hydrocarbons, halogenated hydrocarbons or any combination of any two or more such solvents can also be used.  Particularly suitable solvents include, for example, water, allyl acetate, acetonitrile, acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, ethyl acetate, dimethylformamide, dimethylsulfoxide, nitromethane, tetrahydrofuran, ethanol, isopropanol, t-butanol, t-amyl alcohol, glymes or any combination thereof.  The preferred solvents are water, allyl acetate, isopropanol, t-butanol, t-amyl<br><br>
alcohol, acetone, acetonitrile, glycols and glycol ethers or any combination of any two or more such solvents.  A more highly preferred system is a solvent system containing an aqueous phase and an organic phase. The organic phase preferably uses excess allyl carboxylate compound as a solvent.  The mixture is preferably mixed vigorously to bring the two phases into intimate contact with each other.  The weight ratio of aqueous to organic phase is preferably 9:1 to 1:9.<br>
The solvents are preferably employed in amounts of from zero to 100, more preferably from 0 to 20, and most preferably from 0 to 10 parts by weight based upon the weight of active-hydrogen-containing component.<br>
Step (3) Epoxidation<br>
The allyl ether, allyl thioether and allyl aryl amine compounds made in step (2) are converted to epoxy compounds by the methods known in the art for epoxidizing ethylenic or olefinic double bonds with peroxygen compounds.  Suitable methods include those disclosed in Epoxy Resins Chemistry and Technology, 2nd Ed., 1988, Clayton A. May, Marcel Dekker, Inc., Chapter 2, part III, pp. 15-46; Buchler et al., U.S. Patent 4,973,718 (November 27, 1990); Schmidt et al., U.S. Patent 4,845,252 (July 4, 1989); and Kim, U.S. Patent 4,418,203 (November 29, 1983).<br>
One method to perform such epoxidations is conducted by reacting the allyl ethers with a peroxygen compound such as peracetic acid, t-butyl hydroperoxide, or hydrogen peroxide in the presence of suitable<br><br>
For example, hydrogen peroxide epoxidation is preferably conducted in the presence of<br>
Na2WO4/H3P04/quaternary ammonium salt or trioctyl methyl ammonium nitrate at temperatures of from 0°C to 100°C, more preferably from 20°C to 60°C, and most preferably from 35°C to 50°C.<br>
The peracetic acid epoxidation is preferably conducted at temperatures of from 20°C to 200°C, more preferably from 40°C to 100°C, and most preferably from 40°C to 80°C.<br>
A highly preferred summary of the entire three--step process from propylene to epoxy resin is as follows:<br>
1)	propylene + oxygen + carboxylic acid + catalyst 	&gt; allyl carboxylate;<br>
2)	allyl carboxylate + active-hydrogen-containing<br>
compound such as bisphenol A 	&gt; allyl<br>
derivative of active-hydrogen-containing compound; and<br>
3)	allyl derivative of active-hydrogen-containing<br>
compound + peroxy oxidant 	&gt; glycidyl<br>
derivative of active-hydrogen-containing compound.<br>
The carboxylic acid is most preferably acetic acid, and the allyl carboxylate is most preferably allyl acetate. The active-hydrogen-containing compound is most preferably a bisphenol, the allyl derivative is most preferably a diallyl derivative, and the glycidyl ether<br><br>
derivative is most preferably a diglycidyl ether derivative.<br>
The epoxy resin made by the present invention preferably contains on average at least about one glycidyl ether, glycidyl thioether, or glycidyl aryl amine group per molecule; more preferably contains on average more than one such group per molecule, and most preferably contains on average at least about 1.5 such groups per molecule.  It preferably contains on average no more than about 10 such groups per molecule, more preferably no more than about 3, and most preferably no more than about 2.1.  The functional groups are more preferably glycidyl ether groups. The resin preferably contains less than 600 ppm of organic halogen, more preferably less than about 300 ppm, more highly preferably less than about 150 ppm, and most preferably less than about 50 ppm total organic halogen.  These amounts of "total organic halogen" exclude any halogen atoms which were introduced as part of the active--hydrogen-containing compound.<br>
Theoretically, the process of the present invention, which does not include the use of an epihalohydrin, may result in products totally free of any organic halogen, but some organic halogen may be found in the product due to contamination of raw materials employed including, but not limited to solvents, active-hydrogen-containing compounds, catalysts, and bases.  The epoxy resins prepared by the process of the present invention are useful in such applications as, for example, electrodeposition and powder coatings, encapsulants, molding, casting, composites and laminates, and adhesives.  The epoxy resins prepared by the process of the present invention<br><br>
based on aromatic hydroxyl-containing compounds, particularly those based on cresol-formaldehyde novolac resins are particularly useful in the preparation of electrical laminates and encapsulated electronic components, cathodic electrodeposition and powder coatings since halogen atoms are known to be undesirable-components in epoxy resins used in these applications.<br>
The following examples are illustrative of the invention and should not be interpreted as limiting it in any way. Unless stated otherwise all parts and percentages are given by weight.<br>
In the following examples, the amount of total halide is determined by digesting the sample with caustic (NaOH) and titrating with silver nitrate.<br>
In the following examples, the epoxide equivalent weight (EEW) is determined by titration with an acid.<br>
Example 1<br>
A. Preparation of Bisphenol A Diallyl Ether From Bisphenol A and Allyl Acetate Using a Heterogeneous Palladium Catalyst<br>
To a mixture of 11.4 g (0.05 mole) of bisphenol A, 0.1 g of 5 percent palladium (0.0469 mmole) on charcoal, 0.1 g (0.38 rnmole) of triphenyl phosphine, and 14.5 g (0.105 mole) of potassium carbonate in 30 mL of isopropanol under a nitrogen atmosphere was added 11.0 g (1.1 equivalent.) of allyl acetate and the mixture stirred at 85°C.  After 4 hours, both thin layer chromatography and high performance liquid<br><br>
chromatography analysis showed that the reaction was practically completed and showed only one product peak. The catalyst turnover rate is calculated to be 533 equivalent, of active hydrogen/mole of catalyst/hour.<br>
To the mixture prepared above, 30 mL of water and 100 mL of ethyl acetate were added.  The mixture was shaken well.  The mixture was filtered and the organic layer was separated, dried and concentrated in vacuo at 2 mm Hg and 50°C to yield 15.3 g of a colorless oil representing a yield of 99.4 percent based on bisphenol A.  Both infrared (IR; with no OH absorption) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR; appearance of an appropriate quantity of corresponding allylic protons) spectra were consistent with the desired product of bisphenol A diallyl ether and identical to a known sample of diallyl ether of bisphenol A which was derived from bisphenol A and allyl chloride.<br>
B. Epoxidation of Bisphenol A Diallyl Ether<br>
To a solution of 12.5 g of diallyl ether of bisphenol A (40.6 mmole) and 3.2 g (7.6 mmole) of trioctylmethylammonium nitrate in 30 mL of toluene were added an aqueous solution of 2.6 g of sodium tungstate (8.8 mmole), 1.6 g of phosphoric acid (16.3 mmole) and 16 g (about 0.15 mole) of 30 percent hydrogen peroxide in 32 mL of water (final pH of 2.05).  The mixture was stirred at 40°C and high performance liquid chromatography was used to monitor the progress of the reaction.  After 4 days, the reaction was stopped when total disappearance of the allyl ether and the formation of a new product peak were observed.  The aqueous layer was separated and extracted twice with 20 mL portions of<br><br>
toluene.  The organic reaction mixture was combined with the extracts, washed twice with 30 mL portions of water, and dried over magnesium sulfate and then concentrated in vacuo resulting in 17.0 g of a brown oil.<br>
This crude brown oil was passed through a column of 250 g of silica gel packed in 20 percent of acetone in hexane.  Elution of this column with a gradient of 20 to 50 percent acetone in hexane yielded 9.5 g of a light yellow oil.  Spectral data (IR and NMR; NMR: absence of olefinic protons and appearance of epoxide protons) were consistent with the desired product (the diglycidyl ether of bisphenol A). Furthermore, both thin layer chromatography and high performance liquid chromatography showed identical retention times with known samples of diglycidyl ether of bisphenol A. Analysis showed that the product obtained contained 26 ppm of total chloride and had an epoxy equivalent weight of 182.<br>
Example 2<br>
A.  Preparation of Bisphenol A Diallyl Ether From Bisphenol A and Allyl Acetate Using Homogeneous Palladium Catalyst<br>
To a glass reactor equipped with glass baffles under a nitrogen atmosphere was added a solution of 35.0 g (0.875 mol) of sodium hydroxide in 300 mL of water.  Then 40 g of dry ice was gradually added until a pH of 10.5 was obtained.  Then 45.6 g (0.2 mole) of bisphenol A was added.  After stirring for 20 minutes, the mixture was heated to 85°C and 80.0 g (0.8 mole) of allyl acetate, 0.028 g (0.125 mmole) of palladium acetate and 0.162 g (0.617 mrnole) of triphenyl phosphine<br><br>
were added.  After stirring rapidly (about 600 rpm) for 15 minutes, the reaction was &gt;99 percent complete and the high performance liquid chromatogram showed cleanly one product peak.  The stirring was stopped and the organic layer was separated and concentrated in vacuo to yield 58.61 g of desired product.  The yield was 95.2 percent.  The catalyst turnover rate was calculated to be 12,800/hour.<br>
Repeating the above example using a stirring rate of about 60 rpm instead of about 600 rpm the conversion was only 14.4 percent after 15 minutes.<br>
B.  Epoxidation of Diallyl Ether of Bisphenol A<br>
A 50 mL flask was equipped with a thermometer, condenser, a magnetic stirrer and a pH meter.  A mixture containing:  22.5 g (0.55 mole) of acetonitrile, 10 g of methanol, 0.15 g (1.06 mmole) of dibasic sodium phosphate, 1.69 g (5.5 mrnole) of diallyl ether of bisphenol A from Step (A), and 1.12 g of 30 percent aqueous hydrogen peroxide solution (containing 9.9 mmole of hydrogen peroxide) was added to the flask.  The temperature was raised to 50°C with stirring.  After 6 hours, 1.12 g of 30 percent hydrogen peroxide solution was added, and the temperature was raised to 55°C. After another 6 hours (12 total), 1.68 g of 30 percent hydrogen peroxide solution was added, and the temperature was raised to 60°C.  After another 7 hours (19 total), the reaction was terminated.  The conversion of diallyl ether was about 100 percent.  High--performance liquid chromatography indicates that the ratio of diglycidyl ether of bisphenol A to<br><br>
(monoglycidyl ether-monoallyl ether of bisphenol A + diallyl ether of bisphenol A) is 89.5:10.5.<br>
Example 3<br>
A.	Preparation of Allyl Phenolic Novolac<br>
To a mixture of 6.2 g (20 mmole) of cresol novolac (average M.W. = 310, hydroxy equivalent weight = about 124, average functionality = 2.5), 8.0 g (57.9,mrnole) of potassium carbonate, 50 mg of 5 percent palladium (0.024 mrnole) on charcoal, and 20 mg (0.08 mrnole) of triphenyl phosphine in 25 mL of isopropanol, was slowly added 6.0 g (60 mrnole) of allyl acetate.  After the resultant mixture was stirred at 85°C for 8 hours, high performance liquid chromatography showed that the reaction was complete.  Water (30 mL) and toluene (30 mL) were added to the mixture.  After extracting, the toluene layer was separated and the aqueous layer was again extracted with another 30 mL of toluene.  After separation, the toluene extracts were combined, dried over magnesium sulfate and concentrated in vacuo to a viscous pale yellow oil (7.8 g, about 95 percent yield).  Spectral data of this material were consistent with the desired allylated product.  The NMR spectrum showed the presence of the vinylic hydrogens and the allylic hydrogens while the IR spectrum showed the absence of OH absorption.<br>
B.	Epoxidation of Allyl Phenolic Novolac<br>
An aqueous solution containing 2.65 g (8 mrnole) of sodium tungstate dihydrate, 1.6 g (16 mrnole) of phosphoric acid and 8.0 g (0.165 mole) of 70 percent hydrogen peroxide in 28 mL of water (mixture pH = 2.05) was added to a 24 mL toluene solution containing 12.6 g<br><br>
(0.1 equiv.) of allylated cresol novolac prepared in (A) above and 1.6 g (4.5 mmole) of trioctylmethylammonium nitrate.  The mixture was stirred at 45°C for 28 hours and was stopped when almost all starting material had disappeared.  The mixture was cooled and the organic layer separated and washed 3 times with 50 mL of water. It was then dried over magnesium sulfate, filtered and concentrated in vacuo to give 13.6 g of a viscous amber liquid.<br>
To remove the ammonium nitrate from the crude product, the material was extracted with 5 mL of methanol by warming up with stirring, cooling to room temperature and decanting the methanol phase.  The process was repeated four times.  The product was then concentrated with roto-evaporator (

A mixture of benzyl alcohol (10.8 g, 0.1 mole), allyl acetate (10.5 g, 0.105 mole) and potassium carbonate (15 g, 0.109 mole) in 15 mL of water was stirred under nitrogen for 15 minutes.  Then 10 mg (0.045 ramole) of palladium acetate and 30 mg (0.115 mmole) of triphenyl phosphine were added and the mixture was stirred at 85°C.  After 48 hours, the reaction was 65 percent completed and the reaction rate became quite sluggish.  After cooling, 50 mL of water and 50 mL of toluene were added for extraction.  The organic extract was separated and washed twice with<br><br>
30 mL of water, dried over magnesium sulfate and concentrated in vacuo yielding 14.2 g.  This light brown liquid was distilled and collected at 71°C to 74°C/13 mm Hg, yielding 8.5 g of a colorless liquid (NMR and IR spectra were consistent with the desired benzyl allyl ether).<br>
B.  Epoxidation of Benzyl Allyl Ether<br>
An aqueous solution containing 1.32 g (0.004 mole) of sodium tungstate dihydrate, 1.0 g (0.012 mole) of phosphoric acid and 12.5 g (0.11 mole) of 30 percent hydrogen peroxide in 18 mL of water (mixture pH = 1.98) was added to a 24 mL toluene solution containing 8.5 g (0.574 mole) of benzyl allyl ether and 1.0 g (2.3 mmole) trioctylmethylammonium nitrate.  The mixture was stirred at 45°C for 36 hours and was stopped when almost all starting material had disappeared. The mixture was cooled and the organic layer was separated and washed three times with 50 mL of water.  It was then dried over magnesium sulfate, filtered and concentrated in vacuo to give 12.2 g of a viscous amber liquid.<br>
To remove the ammonium nitrate from the crude product, the material was chromatographed over 200 g of silica gel packed in 10 percent acetone in hexane. Elution of this column with a gradient of 10 to 20 percent acetone/hexane yielded 8.2 g of material analyzed to have total organic chloride of 199 ppm and an EEW of 164.<br><br>
Example 5<br>

A mixture containing 2500 g of deionized water and 352.1 g (8.8 mole) of sodium hydroxide was added to a 5 L glass reactor having a stirrer, a condenser, a temperature controller, heat lamps, and a nitrogen pad. Dry ice was added until the pH of the solution was 10.8, and then 300 g (2.0 mole) of t-butylphenol was added. The mixture was heated to 83°C with stirring, and 400 g (4.0 mole) of allyl acetate was added.  A mixture containing 1.625 g (6.2 mmole) of triphenylphosphine and 0.280 g (1.25 mmole) of palladium acetate was added immediately.  The mixture foamed for a short time. After the foaming had decreased, an additional 300 g (2.0 mole) of t-butylphenol and 400 g (4.0 mole) of allyl acetate were added.  The mixture was stirred for 30 minutes, and then cooled to 50°C.  The organic layer was separated and washed with two 1000 mL portions of 1 percent aqueous EDTA solution and two 500 mL portions of water.  Anhydrous sodium sulfate was added to the supernatant until clear, and then 5 g of activated carbon was added.  The mixture was vacuum filtered.  The filtrate was stripped and concentrated at 1 to 2 mm of vacuum and 60°C to give 808 g of crude t-butylphenyl allyl ether.  The crude product was further distilled at 85°C to 90°C and 3 to 3.5 mmHg pressure for further purification.<br>
