				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a holder for ixzzir.-s arcund a user's finger and holding an i-plement thereto.<br>
There are a number of devices know- for attachment cf a writing implement to a user's finger or hand. Conventionally these devices comprise a rigid band which fi s onto the'finger or is strapped around a hand, and have attached a discrete, smaller band through which 3 pencil cr other such writing implement can be inserted such that the writing implement is held in the region of the user's hand.<br>
However, there are a numoer of crawoacks associated "ith such known devices. For example, they can be uncomfortable to wear, and may also restrict moverr.er.t of tWe ringers or hand, particularly those devices that completely encircle the user's palm. Naturally, this i"s a considerable disadvantage for those users requiring a Jugh degree of flexibility Gi-her when using the implement ov when the i~p) ement is no: ,n a^e but i*s merely attached to the user's har.d. Moreover, in many cases, these known devices merely provide a means of attaching an implement in the region of a user's nand, and may require further adjustment by the user, using his fingers and/or his other hand, in order to move the implement up or down as necessary within its .holder and to correctly orient the implement for use. Further, the known cevices only allow for one implement to be attached in the rercion of the user's hand at any time; no provisions are made for multiple implements.<br>
It is therefore an object _of th^e present invention co seek to overcome these disadvantages.<br>
According to the present invention, there is provided a holder for t it ting t "around a user's ";:inger and holding sr. implement thereto, the holder comprising a band at least ^ portion of vnich is elastic, the band r.aving a first oo:--.^r.<br><br>
- 2 -<br>
and a second portion, wherein the firs: and second portions are o£ substantially tN&gt; sanse width or wherein one of sale first and second portions is narrower in width and the oc^r is otuauer in width, and at least one reinforcing menber.<br>
In use, the holder secures an implement to the user's index finger so that the implement car. be grasped and released repeatedly depending ... whether or not the user requires the implement. When the user no longer requires use of the implement, he can simply release his grip, che implement being retained by the holder ready for the user to take up again. "Moreover, the holder secures the implement to the user's' finger in an orientation such as tc facilitate the correct positioning of the implement in the user's hand when the user grasps the implement. The holder of the present invention can accommoc e more than one implement, thus allowing the user Co switch from one implement to another with ease, and'without che need to drop one implement in order to pick up another. This multitasking capability is advantageous for, for example, an artist when drawing, as it is not necessary for the artist to put down, foe example, a paintbrush or pen in order to carry out other tasks, for example erasing pencil lines.<br>
Other potential uses of the holder of the present invention include use by make-up artists requiring access to 6 range of different brushes, use by tattoo art-ists, and use as a teaching tool, for example to help to teach children to write or to aid persons who have difficulty holding certain implements, such as writing implements or chopsticks.<br>
The  elastic. portion of the  band renders the band expandable, so that the holder can fit onto and grip around -fingers of differing sizer..<br>
In use,, thfe first, portion is. preferably located over the top of a finger, whilst the second portion is located generally or. the underside of the finger.<br><br>
The re :r. forcing me~jj^r." may Da s r: ; , c. 'zad =;;ir.3i o-¦r.i^:": the user's th-Jtnb can press to stabilise ~n*= impier.enc ir.'use and provide greater control. The reinfc r CUIG merger oreverrcs cr.e cane from becoming twisted during fitting onto, or removal from,   the   user's   finger.<br>
7ne first and second portions may b= of substantially'the sarr.e width. ?-. ternatively, the width ;: one of the first cr second portions may be smaller than that of the other portion. In this way, it can be appreciated that the narrower portion allows the user freedom to bend his finger, whilst the broader portion provides a base for securely molding an implement against   a   finger.<br>
Preferably, where present, at leait the broader of the first and second portions of the o&amp;r.-j is elastic. Hort p:. ferably, the band comprises a contiguous closed loop of elastic   material.<br>
Alter natively, the bane may corr.pr i re one c ¦ r.ore pieces of material that can be attached to itselL or one another respectively to form a closed loop of variable size- The means of attachment may comprise, for example, Velcro, press stucs, hooks   and   eyes,    or   a   buckle.<br>
The band may be provided with at least one cut, preferably, where present, in the broader of the first ar.d second portions and through which,' for =ase of insertion, the implement can be inserted. The second portion of the banci may be provided with at least two cuts, Lto thereby form a loop through  which   loop   the   implement may.be   inserted.<br>
Alternatively,   the   holder  may   further   comprise   a   strip of at   least  partially elastic material  vhich  forms  a   loop with<br>
¦ -the  band,   through  wh-ich   loop  the  -irTipl-ement- can  be   inserted-<br>
i _      In  preferred -embodiments,,   the   bair.z   is   provided  w.ith  twe<br>
reinforcing    members.     It    is    further    preferred   that    the    two reinforcing  members   are diametrically   :ppoaec   to  one  another.<br><br>
- 4 -<br>
Conveniently, the at least one reinforcing member comprises means for identification of origin, for example a trade mar:
Embodiments of the present invention will now be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:<br>
Figure 1 is a perspective view of a first embodiment of the holder of the present invention.<br>
Figure 2 is a front view of the holder of figure 1. Figure 3 is ,a side view of the holder of Figures 1 and 2. figure 4 is a top view of the holder of Figures 1 tc 3. Figure 5 is a bottom view of the holder of Figures 1 to 4. Figure 6 is a bottom view of a second embodiment of the holder of the present invention.<br>
:gure 7 is a perspective view of a third embodiment of a holder of the present invention.<br>
Figure 8 is a front view of the holder of Figure 7. Figure 9 is a side view of the holder of Figures 7 and 6. Figure 10 is a perspective side view from above of the holder of Figures 7 to 9.<br>
Referring to Figures 1 to 5, a first embodiment of the holder of the present invention comprises a bane comprising a first portion 11 and a second portion 13. The first portion 11 and second portion 13 are made of elastic material and form a continuous loop. The second portion 13 has a cut 14 therein, through which in use an implement can be inserted/ to thereby grip the implement between the second portion 13 and the finger of a user. The band further includes two reinforcing members 12, which are diametrically opposed on either side of the band. The reinforcing members 12 can 'comprise "means for indication of origin, for example a trade mark or other marketing material.<br>
Referring tc Figure 6, a second embodiment of the holder<br><br>
of toe present invention is substantially the $-.:o¦o¦¦ -IT- rjhe first embodiment, but has twu cues 14 in' the second portion 13 forming a loop 15, rather than the single cu: 14 of the first embodiment. An implement to be held can thus be passed chrough the loop 15 so as to be held by the holder.<br>
Referring to Figures 7 to 10, a third embodiment of the holder of the-present invention is substantially the same as the first/and second embodiments described above, buz further comprises a strip of material 16 which forms a loop with the band, in a similar way to the loop IS of the second enoodiinent described above, an implement to be held can be passed chrough the loop 16 so as to be held by the holder.<br>
Although the holder of the present invention^is directed to use for holding a drawing/writing implement, it will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that it may also be used for holding any other suitable har.d-held Lmpler.e-t, and ruay be particularly beneficial in teaching children iz wri-e.<br><br>
