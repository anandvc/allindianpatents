Method, System and Apparatus for Providing Modulation and Coding Mode used by Multicast Service Macro Diversity<br>
Field of the Technology<br>
The present invention relates to multicast service macro diversity techniques, more particularly to a method, a system and apparatus for providing modulation and coding mode used by multicast service macro diversity.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
With the rapid development of the Internet, a lot of multimedia services have emerged, some of which require the same data to reach multiple users at the same time, namely to be multicast, and such services may be video on demand, television on demand, video conference, online education, interactive games and so on.<br>
Multicast is a technique that transfers data from one data source to multiple destinations, including multicast and broadcast. As to broadcast services, Cell Broadcast Service (CBS) in traditional mobile networks only allows transmitting low-bit-rate data to all users through the cell's shared broadcast channel, which belongs to message services. As to multicast services, there are IP multicast techniques in terms of the existing IP networks, but the mobile network has some characteristics different from those of IP network, such as network structure, function entities and wireless interfaces, so the current IP multicast techniques are not suitable for mobile networks. In addition, compared with common services, mobile multimedia services are of the characteristics such as large quantity of data, long time duration, delay sensitive and so on. Therefore, transmission using current techniques of broadcast services and multicast service are not suitable for data transmission of mobile multimedia services.<br>
In order to effectively utilize wireless resources, the Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP), which is a Wide Code Division Multiple Access/Global System for Mobile Communications (WCDMA/GSM) global standardization organization, provides Multimedia Broadcast/Multicast Service (MBMS), and on the other hand, Multicast and Broadcast Service (MBS) is introduced into the latest protocol IEEE802.16e/D5 of<br><br>
IEEE802.16. MBMS service and MBS service provide the specifications of multicast in the mobile networks, so that a mobile network can provide point to multipoint services, thereby network resources can be shared, utilization ratio of network resources, especially of the air interface, is increased. The newly provided MBMS and MBS service can realize multicast and broadcast of both low-bit-rate text messages and high-bit-rate multimedia services, and this is obviously the trend of future mobile traffic development.<br>
The network structure of the MBS service in IEEE802.16 protocol is shown in figure 1. With reference to figure 1, a mobile network function entity, MBS server, is newly added to support MBS service, one function of MBS server is to act as entry of content providers, and another is to manage multicast data transmission of the Base Stations (BSs) belonging to the MBS server, as well as distribute multicast data to those BSs. In addition, function entities like Mobile Stations (MSs) and BSs need to be mended by adding MBS service-relevant functions.<br>
The MBS service operation mainly comprises following steps: obtaining MBS service list information, MBS service authentication and obtaining the key, and normally receiving the MBS service. Specifically, before normally receiving the MBS service, MS acquires information, such as MBS content list, from MBS server first, and then requests a BS to authenticate the received MBS service content; after successful authentication, the BS transmits MBS downlink service parameters and other information to the MS, the MS then requests the BS to return the MBS key; When receiving the downlink service parameters and MBS key, the MS can receive related Media Access Control Protocol Data Unit (MAC PDU) and begin to receive the MBS service normally.<br>
As mentioned above, normally receiving MBS service mainly means receiving MBS service content with the received MBS downlink service parameters. In the current standard draft, MBS downlink service parameters mainly include MBS ZONE identifier and Multicast Connection ID (Multicast CID).<br>
In order to support macro diversity, which can improve the receiving performance, MBS-MAP message is introduced into IEEE802.16e/D5, the latest edition of IEEE802.16, this message is transmitted in MBS ZONE and its Information Elements (IEs) are shown as table 1.<br><br><br>
The MBS-MAP message is used to notify each Multicast CID in the MBS ZONE of the physical channel resources allocated for them, including modulation and coding mode(s) of the burst, which is (are) indicated by a Downlink Interval Usage Code (DIUC), power offset, which is indicated by Boosting, and position of the next MBS frame. Therefore, if it correctly detects the MBS-MAP message, an MS can obtain the expected burst corresponding to the multicast connection, and the modulation and coding mode(s) used on the burst, and the power offset etc, then determines the position of the next MBS frame in this multicast connection, thereby normally receives the data through the multicast connection.<br>
In the MBS-MAP message, the IE of DIUC is a 4-bit identifier used to identify the<br><br>
modulation and coding mode(s) used by current burst, and each form of the 4-bit identifier represents one kind of modulation and coding mode, thus the 4-bit identifier is also called a DIUC index, i.e. an index of modulation and coding modes. This DIUC value is defined in the Downlink Channel Description (DCD) message which is periodically broadcast by the current cell. Any change of the DCD message is identified by the Configuration Change Count in the DCD message and traced by using DCD count in other related information. For instance, DCD count is used in a Downlink Map (DL-MAP) message to track changes of the DCD message.<br>
In the cellular systems, users at the edge of a cell endure poor communication qualities due to their long distance to the BS. To overcome this defect, macro diversity is introduced into cellular systems; with macro diversity, a receiver can receive signals from surrounding base stations, and extract useful signals from the received signals, thereby avoiding poor communication quality due to receiving signals from the single BS.<br>
In the current solution, it is the current cell DIUC definition that the MBS service uses. To support macro diversity, all the cells in a MBS ZONE must utilize the same DIUC definition, that means sending the same DCD message. To realize that, an entity is needed to uniformly manage the DIUC definition of each cell, namely the definition of the DCD message.<br>
Moreover, when receiving the MBS service, a receiver needs to continuously track the DL-MAP message in order to track the change of the DCD count, so as to determine whether to receive a new DCD message or not, in spite of the receiver is in SLEEP state or IDLE state, which is obviously a waste of power.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>

Brief Description of the Drawings<br>
Figure 1 is a schematic diagram illustrating a system structure supporting the MBS service in IEEE802.16 in the prior art.<br>
Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
The solution of the present invention will be illustrated in detail hereinafter with reference to specific embodiments.<br>
The first embodiment of the present invention is to add an MBS-DCD message, i.e. a DIUC value, in the MBS ZONE to define the modulation and coding mode used in current MBS ZONE. The structure of the defined MBS-DCD message is as shown in<br><br>
Wherein, the definition of Downlink_Burst_Profile in Table 2 is given in chapter<br><br>
11.4.2 of IEEE802.16-2004, in the MBS-DCD message, Downlink_Burst_Profile defines the specific meaning of each 4-bit DIUC index.<br>
In addition, as other messages set in the MBS ZONE, transmitting position of the MBS-DCD message should be specified in the MBS-MAP message.<br>
After the setting, when receiving MBS service, the MS determines the position of MBS-MAP message, and tracks this message until the corresponding MBS-DCD message is correctly received, then analyzes other messages in the MBS ZONE with relevant description upon DIUC in the MBS-DCD message, and receives the downlink MBS service according to the analyzed result.<br>
In the present embodiment, an MBS-DCD message containing the definition and index of the modulation and coding mode used in MBS ZONE is added into the MBS ZONE, according to the definition and index of the modulation and coding mode contained in the message, the MS receives the downlink MBS service. The transmission of the added MBS-DCD message is specified in the MBS-MAP message that is sent by the MBS Server, and the MBS-DCD message is uniformly managed by the MBS Server in the MBS ZONE, so there is no need to introduce a new entity to uniformly manage the DCD messages of all cells in the same MBS ZONE as in the prior art.<br>
The second embodiment of the present invention is to improve current MBS-MAP message so as to track the change of DCD message. An IE of DCD count is added into the MBS-MAP message, so that the update of DCD message can be recorded by this IE. The IEs of the improved MBS-MAP message is as shown in figure 3.<br><br><br>
In this way, when receiving the MBS-MAP message, the MS checks whether the carried DCD count is identical to the Configuration Change Count reserved in the current DCD message, if identical, the MS receives the MBS service normally; otherwise, the MS tracks the DCD message until the Configuration Change Count contained in the new received DCD message is identical to the DCD count in the MBS-MAP message. Then the MS analyzes other messages in the MBS ZONE according to the relevant description upon DIUC message in this new DCD message, and receives the downlink MBS service according to the analyzed result.<br>
In the present embodiment, the MBS-MAP message is improved by adding an IE indicating the update of MBS-DCD message, so that the MS can decide whether to receive the new DCD message according to the fact whether this IE is identical to the corresponding IE in the current DCD message reserved by the MS, thereby the MS need not continuously track the DL-MAP message, unless it is detected that the IE of the MBS-MAP message is not identical to the counterpart in the current DCD message reserved by the MS, so that the receiver in IDLE mode or SLEEP mode need not<br><br>
continuously  monitor the  DL-MAP messages  of current  service  cell  and  power consumption of the MS is reduced.<br>
The third embodiment of the present invention is to add an MBS-DCD message, i.e. a DIUC value, in the MBS ZONE at first to define the modulation and coding mode used in current MBS ZONE. The MBS-DCD message is as shown in table 4.<br><br>
Wherein, the definition of Downlink_Burst_Profiie is in reference to chapter 11.4.2 of IEEE802.16-2004. Besides, the transmission position of MBS-DCD message needs to be specified in the MBS-MAP message.<br>
Meanwhile, the MBS-MAP message should be improved to track the change of MBS-DCD message. Therefore, a MBS-DCD count IE is added into the MBS-MAP message, which can indicate the update of the MBS-DCD message. The improved MBS-MAP message is as shown in Table 5.<br><br><br><br>
Table 5<br>
After the setting, when receiving the MBS-MAP message, the MS checks whether the carried DCD count is identical to the Configuration Change Count reserved in the current DCD message at first, if identical, the MS will receive the MBS service normally; otherwise, the MS will continuously track the DCD message until the Configuration Change Count contained in the received new DCD message is identical to the MBS-DCD count in the MBS-MAP message. Then the MS will analyze other messages in the MBS ZONE according to the relevant description upon DIUC message in this new DCD message, and receive the downlink MBS service according to the analyzed result.<br>
In the present embodiment, by setting the MBS-DCD message in MBS ZONE and improving the MBS-MAP message, it is realized that the MBS-DCD message in MBS ZONE is uniformly managed by the MBS Server, so that there is no need to introduce a new entity to uniformly manage the DCD messages of all cells in the same MBS ZONE, further, the MS can determine whether to receive the new MBS-DCD message by the fact whether the IE, which is added into the MBS-MAP message and used to indicate the update of the MBS-DCD message, is identical to the corresponding IE reserved in the current MBS-DCD message, so that the MS need not continuously track the DL-MAP message, so that the receiver in IDLE state or SLEEP state need not continuously monitor<br><br>
the DL-MAP messages of current service cell and power consumption of the MS is reduced.<br>
In view of the foregoing description it will be evident to a person skilled in the art that various modifications may be made within the scope of the invention. While a preferred embodiment of the invention has been described in detail, it should be apparent that many modifications and variations thereto are possible, all of which fall within the true spirit and scope of the invention.<br><br><br>
