I claim the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/346,779 which was filed<br>
on October 18,2001.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention is directed to ceramic products made from waste glass; raw batch<br>
formulations for making ceramic products from waste glass; and a method for making<br>
ceramic products from waste glass. The invention provides a low-cost method of<br>
manufacturing ceramic products from waste glass with the addition of a solid organic<br>
binder, without the use of water or any other liquid solvent. This method is especially<br>
useful for processing water-sensitive glass compositions into ceramic products, but water-<br>
insensitive glass compositions can also be used. A wide variety of ceramic products can<br>
be manufactured by the invention. Examples are provided where the invention is used to<br>
make ceramic tile from different types of recycled waste glass.<br>
The invention also addresses two current problems: energy usage by the ceramic<br>
industry needs to be reduced; and new recycled-glass products are needed. The ceramic<br>
industry consumes large amounts of energy, especially during the firing process. Firing<br>
temperatures greater than 1200°C (2200°F) are required to sinter typical ceramic raw<br>
materials into dense products. Modifications of the raw material formulations have led to<br>
reductions in firing temperatures, but the improvements are limited because of the types of<br>
raw materials used. Most traditional ceramic products, such as tile and brick, consist<br>
mainly of clay-based raw materials, which inherently require high firing temperatures.<br>
Other ceramic manufacturing steps, such as the drying processes, are also very energy<br>
intensive. Energy costs are a major portion of the total manufacturing costs, and thus new<br>
methods to reduce the amount of energy required will be a great benefit to the ceramic<br>
industry.<br>
New products utilizing recycled waste glass are needed to further promote glass<br>
recycling, because only a limited amount of glass can be remelted to make new containers<br>
(currently the primary use of recycled glass). New products are especially needed that are<br>
less sensitive to contaminants in the glass, and that can be made from green or mixed-<br>
color container glass waste. Research has been conducted and products developed using<br>
recycled glass as a ceramic raw material. However, processing problems have limited the<br>
developments, so that only a negligible amount of waste glass is currently utilized<br>
(excluding remelting to form new glass products). These problems occur because of<br>
inherent chemical and processing incompatibilities with traditional ceramic raw materials<br>
and manufacturing methods. These incompatibilities have greatly hampered the<br>
development of ceramic products from waste glass.<br>
U.S. Patent # 6,340,650 reviews previous waste glass processing problems, and<br>
provides a new method to eliminate these problems by avoiding the use of water and clay<br>
in the processing. This method includes the addition of an organic binder to bond the<br>
waste glass particles together in the forming process. The organic binder is initially either<br>
in either a liquid or solid state. If a solid organic binder is used, then the binder is<br>
dissolved in a nonaqueous liquid. This method eliminates previous problems, however<br>
there are still some disadvantages. The present invention eliminates these disadvantages,<br>
as discussed in the following paragraphs.<br>
To be effective an organic binder needs to be in liquid form, so that the waste glass<br>
particles can be wetted and coated by the organic binder. A single phase organic binder at<br>
room temperature (~20°C) is in either a liquid or solid state. If an organic binder is in a<br>
liquid state, then the ceramic particles can be directly mixed with the binder to coat the<br>
particles. The mixture can then be formed into the desired article, but the green strength<br>
of the article will be low compared to if the binder is in a solid state. The green strength<br>
refers to the strength of the unfired green article produced after the forming step. The<br>
green strength needs to be high enough so that the articles can be transferred from the<br>
forming step to the firing step without breakage. In addition, the level of green strength<br>
required increases as the size of the article increases.<br>
If the organic binder is in a solid state, then the binder can be dissolved in specific<br>
liquids, mixed with the waste glass particles, and then dried to remove the liquid to<br>
produce waste glass particles coated with the organic binder. Water is commonly used as<br>
the liquid. For water-sensitive ceramic raw materials, water can be replaced with<br>
nonaqueous liquids, such as alcohols. However, processing with nonaqueous liquids<br>
increases the cost and complexity of manufacturing, and can add environmental problems.<br>
The present invention involves a new method of coating waste glass powder with a<br>
solid organic binder, which improves the green strength compared to when a liquid binder<br>
is used. The invention also eliminates the need for water or any other liquid solvent. In<br>
the invention the binder is initially a solid, which is then melted to form a liquid, coated on<br>
the glass powder, and cooled to solidify the binder to form a solid-binder-coated-glass<br>
mixture. The mixture is then formed into a green article, and fired into a high-quality<br>
ceramic product.<br>
The invention can be used to produce an impervious ceramic microstructure with<br>
only a small amount of porosity. Impervious refers to ceramic products with very low<br>
water absorptions of less than 0.5%. An impervious ceramic microstructure with a small<br>
amount of porosity is critical to achieve high-quality properties. Ceramic products can<br>
be produced by the invention with a wide range of colors with smooth glossy glaze-like<br>
surfaces. The surface texture and other fired properties can also be adjusted by the<br>
addition of fillers, and/or by partial crystallization of the glass. The invention conserves<br>
energy and natural resources compared to traditional ceramic processing methods.<br>
BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention provides a method to transform large quantities of waste glass into<br>
useful ceramic products by a low-cost manufacturing process. The major steps of the<br>
method involve combining waste glass with a solid organic binder; melting the binder to<br>
form a liquid binder; mixing to coat the liquid binder on the waste glass particles; cooling<br>
to below the melting temperature of the binder; crushing and sieving the cooled mixture;<br>
forming the sieved material into a green article; heating the green article to burnout the<br>
organic binder; and then firing to produce a ceramic product. The method improves green<br>
strength compared to previous methods, and does not require water or any other liquid<br>
solvent. Only one firing step is needed with a low peak firing temperature of about 700°C<br>
to about 1000°C. The method conserves energy and natural resources compared to clay-<br>
based traditional ceramic manufacturing. High-quality impervious ceramic products can<br>
be produced by the invention.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The raw batch formulations of the invention consist of waste glass combined with<br>
organic binders. In the example's provide below, the waste glass consists of fiber glass,<br>
container glass, and flat glass. The organic binder in the examples consists of<br>
polyethylene glycol. Other types of waste glass and organic binders can be used without<br>
changing the scope of the invention. The waste glass can originate from industrial or post-<br>
consumer sources. The organic binders that are used in the invention must melt, when<br>
heated above the melting temperature of the binder, to a liquid state that will coat the<br>
ceramic raw material particles during mixing. ' After this heating and mixing process, the<br>
organic binder must transform to a solid state when cooled to below the melting<br>
temperature of the binder.<br>
Other common ceramic processing additives, such as plasticizers, lubricants,<br>
preservatives, etc. can also be added to the raw batch formulation to further optimize the<br>
processing without changing the scope of the invention. These additives can be added<br>
before and/or after melting the organic binder.<br>
Inorganic fillers can be added to the waste glass without changing the scope of the<br>
invention. Inorganic fillers can be added to modify the color, surface texture, or any other<br>
property of the final product. Inorganic fillers include ceramic raw materials and<br>
colorants. Fillers can be added individually or in combination. Examples of ceramic raw<br>
materials that can be added include, but are not limited to, alumina, silica, and zirconia.<br>
Fillers with coarse sized particles can also be added to adjust properties, such as improving<br>
slip resistance by roughing the surface texture.<br>
The first step of the method consists of combining the waste glass with the organic<br>
binder and any other additives to be included at this stage of the process, according to the<br>
raw batch formulation. The preferred raw batch formulation is comprised of about 90 to<br>
about 99 weight percent waste glass, and about 1 to about 10 weight percent solid organic<br>
binder. If a filler is added to the raw batch formulation, then replacing about 0.1 to about<br>
40 weight percent of the waste glass with filler is preferred. The amount of filler addition<br>
will depend on the type of waste glass used, and the final properties desired.<br>
The waste glass should preferably be in powder form. The glass powder particle<br>
size required depends on the final properties desired. If water-sensitive waste glass is<br>
used, then dry processing of the waste glass powder is needed to produce an impervious<br>
ceramic product. The need for dry processing of water-sensitive glass compositions is<br>
discussed in detail in U.S. Patent # 6,340,650.<br>
The raw batch materials can be mixed in any type of mixer that will uniformly<br>
distribute the raw batch components, such as a pan mixer, conical blender, ribbon mixer,<br>
rotating drum mixer, etc. This mixing step is preferable, bat not a necessary step of the<br>
invention. The combined, and optionally mixed, raw batch materials are then heated to<br>
above the melting temperature of the organic binder. During this heating process the<br>
materials are mixed to coat the liquid organic binder on the waste glass particles to form a<br>
liquid-binder-coated-glass mixture. Various types of mixers with heating jackets can be<br>
used for this process, such as a rotating pan mixer with Muller-type wheels. Other<br>
methods of heating and mixing the materials can also be used without changing the scope<br>
of the invention.<br>
After the heating and mixing steps, the liquid-binder-coated-glass mixture is<br>
cooled to below the melting temperature of the organic binder, so that the binder<br>
transforms back to a solid state and a solid-binder-coated-glass mixture is formed.<br>
Additional additives, as discussed above, can be combined with the cooled mixture at this<br>
stage of the process. The cooled mixture with any additional additives is then crushed to<br>
break up agglomerates and to provide further mixing. Example types of equipment that<br>
can be used include hammer mills, roller mills, and rotating pan mixers with Muller-type<br>
wheels. Any other type of milling and/or' grinding equipment that will crush the<br>
agglomerates into a powder can be used for this step. After crushing, the material is then<br>
sieved to produce a more uniformly sized flowable powder. Various mesh size sieves can<br>
be used depending on the powder size desired for the forming process. The particles that<br>
do not pass through the sieve can be circulated back to the crushing step.<br>
The sieved powder is then formed into a green article. Green here refers to the<br>
formed article in the unfired state. Any type of forming method can be used, such as<br>
pressing or extrusion. Preferably dry pressing is used. For dry pressing, the powder is<br>
placed in a metal die of the desired shape and pressed with rams to compact the powder.<br>
The pressed article is then removed from the die and fired in a kiln or furnace. An<br>
additional drying step in an oven can be included before firing to remove any liquid, if<br>
present. Preferably, this drying step is not required, because additional liquid was not<br>
included.<br>
The initial stage of the firing process consists of binder burnout to remove the<br>
organic binder. Preferably the binder bumout is conducted during the initial heating of the<br>
ceramic articles for firing. Separate processes of binder burnout and firing can also be<br>
used. The specific binder burnout and firing profiles of temperature and time will depend<br>
on the raw batch formulation used. The preferred maximum firing temperature is from<br>
about 7006C to about 1000°C.<br>
The following paragraphs provide 16 examples of the invention. These examples<br>
demonstrate how the invention can be used to make ceramic tiles from different types of<br>
recycled waste glass. Most of the steps of the method are the same for each of the<br>
examples. The differences are from variations in the raw batch formulations, firing<br>
conditions, and sample size.<br>
Example 1: The raw batch formulation of Example 1 consisted of 94% fiber glass<br>
powder and 6% organic binder (percentages based on weight). The fiber glass powder<br>
was prepared from fiber glass waste obtained from a fiber glass manufacturer. The waste<br>
was from E-glass continuous fiber glass production, and had been processed into fibers<br>
less than about 1/4 inch in length. The waste was dry milled in an alumina ball mill with<br>
alumina media, and then sieved through 100 mesh (
powder was then combined with the organic binder in amounts based on the raw batch<br>
formulation. Polyethylene glycol (Carbowax PEG-8000 powder) from Union Carbide<br>
Corporation with a melting temperature range of 60-63°C was used as the organic binder.<br>
The fiber glass and organic binder powders were initially mixed in a plastic<br>
container by hand shaking. The glass-binder mixture was then transferred to a glass<br>
container and heated in an oven to about 90-95°C, which caused the organic binder to<br>
melt. After heating for about one hour, the mixture was taken out of the oven, and then<br>
quickly mixed and ground in the heated glass container with a ceramic pestle. The pestle<br>
had also been heated in the oven to about 90-95°C. During this mixing process the binder<br>
was in liquid form, which allowed the binder to coat and agglomerate the glass particles.<br>
The agglomerated glass-binder mixture was then kept at room temperature (~20°C) for<br>
about one hour. This allowed the temperature of the mixture to decrease to below the<br>
melting temperature of the binder, which caused the binder to solidify and harden the<br>
agglomerates. The hardened agglomerated glass-binder mixture was then crushed and<br>
ground in a ceramic mortar and pestle, and sieved through a 100 mesh screen.<br>
The sieved binder-coated glass powder was then pressed at 2,000 psi (pounds per<br>
square inch) in a 1.25 inch by 1.25 inch square metal die using a hydraulic press. The<br>
pressed articles were fired in a programmable box furnace to first burnout the organic<br>
binder, and then to sinter the glass powder into a dense ceramic product. A maximum<br>
temperature of 890°C was held for 30 minutes. The resulting ceramic tiles had densities<br>
of ~2.60 g/cc (greater than 99% of the theoretical density of E-glass of 2.61 g/cc). The<br>
ceramic tiles were translucent with smooth glaze-like surfaces.<br>
Example 2: The same procedure described above for Example 1 was used for this<br>
example, except that a 2.5 inch by 2.5 inch square, metal die was used. High quality tiles<br>
resulted similar to those of Example 1, except that the tiles had about four times larger<br>
surface area.<br>
Examples 3-9: The same procedure described above for Example 1 was also used<br>
for these examples, except that one weight percent of the fiber glass powder was replaced<br>
by a colorant filler. Seven commercially available ceramic colorants were evaluated.<br>
Example 3 used a white colorant (Mason #6700); Example 4 a blue colorant (Mason<br>
#6306); Example 5 a black colorant (Mason #6109); Example 6 a yellow colorant (Mason<br>
#6405); Example 7 a red colorant (Mason #6003); Example 8 a green colorant (Mason<br>
#6201); and Example 9 a brown colorant (Mason #6163). High quality tile resulted<br>
similar to those of Example 1, except that the colors of the tile corresponded to the<br>
colorant used. These examples demonstrate the ability of producing ceramic tile from<br>
recycled waste glass with a wide range of colors by the invention.<br>
Example 10: The same procedure described above for Example 1 was used for this<br>
example, except that the fiber glass powder was replaced with container glass powder, and<br>
a maximum firing temperature of 800°C was used with a 10 minute hold time at this<br>
temperature. The container glass powder was prepared from clear glass bottles and jars by<br>
a two step grinding process. In the first step whole glass containers were crushed in an in-<br>
house designed crushing system which involved crushing glass in a closed hard plastic<br>
chamber. The crushed glass was then sieved through 6 mesh (
step the 
and then sieved through 100 mesh (
~2.47 g/cc (greater than 98% of the theoretical density of container glass of 2.51 g/cc).<br>
The samples were glossy white in color with smooth glaze-like surfaces.<br>
Examples 11 and 12: The same procedure described above for Example 10 was<br>
also used for these examples, except that the clear glass containers were replaced by green<br>
glass bottles in Example 11 and brown glass bottles in Example 12. High quality tiles<br>
resulted similar to those of Example 10, except that the Example 11 tiles were green<br>
colored, and the Example 12 tiles brown colored.<br>
Example 13: The same procedure described above for Example 10 was also used<br>
for this example, except that the container glass powder was replaced by mixed-color<br>
container glass powder which was prepared by the following procedure. Mixed-color<br>
container glass with a particle size 
processing company. The glass was first dried in an oven at ~120°C to remove moisture.<br>
The dried glass was milled in an alumina ball mill with alumina media, and then sieved<br>
through 100 mesh (
except that the tiles were green colored.<br>
Example 14: The same procedure described above for Example 10 was also used<br>
for this example, except that the container glass powder was replaced by clear flat glass<br>
powder which was prepared by the following procedure. Clear flat glass with a particle<br>
size 
dried in an oven at ~120°C to remove moisture. The dried glass was milled in an alumina<br>
ball mill with alumina media, and then sieved through 100 mesh (
tile resulted similar to those of Example 10, except that the tiles were white colored.<br>
Example 15: The same procedure described above for Example 13 was used for<br>
this example, except that a 5 inch by 5 inch square metal die was used. High quality tiles<br>
resulted similar to those of Example 13, except that the tiles had about sixteen times larger<br>
surface area.<br>
Example 16: The same procedure described above for Example 14 was used for<br>
this example, except that a S inch by 5 inch square metal die was used. High quality tiles<br>
resulted similar to those of Example 14, except that the tiles had about sixteen times larger<br>
surface area.<br>
A detailed description of the invention with examples was described above. It is<br>
understood that various other changes and modifications can be made to the present<br>
invention by those skilled in the art without departing from the scope of the invention. For<br>
example, a glaze can also be applied to the ceramic product if desired, but is not necessary.<br>
A glaze can be applied before firing, so that only one firing is required. A glaze can also<br>
be applied after firing, but then a second firing is required.<br>
Examples were provided demonstrating that the invention can be used to produce<br>
ceramic tile from recycled waste glass with a wide range of colors and smooth glossy<br>
glaze-like surfaces. The surface texture and other fired properties can also be adjusted by<br>
the addition of fillers, and/or by partial crystallization of the glass. Other ceramic products<br>
can be manufactured by the invention, and other raw batch formulations used, without<br>
changing the scope of the invention.<br>

water or any other liquid solvent. Only one firing step is needed with a low peak<br>
firing temperature of about 700°C.to about 1000°C. The method conserves<br>
energy and natural resources compared to clay-based traditional ceramic<br>
manufacturing. High-quality impervious ceramic products can be produced by the<br>
invention.</td>
