				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1. Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to data communication device and method in a<br>
mobile communication system, and in particular, to device and method for<br>
communicating data with selection transmit diversity (STD).<br>
2. Description of the Related Art<br>
Transmit diversity technology offers the advantage of receiver diversity<br>
without increasing receiver complexity. STD also makes the advantage of receiver<br>
diversity possible without requiring a great modification to the structure of a<br>
terminal, and thus increases the capacity of a reverse link in digital cellular mobile<br>
communication. Implementation of STD in mobile communications requires the<br>
use of plural antennas for a base station as well as the following.<br>
The STD function in a mobile communication system requires a terminal<br>
that measures the channel qualities of signals received from antennas of a base<br>
station, as well as receives data, and notifies the base station of the measurement<br>
result. For this purpose, the base station has forward link common channels<br>
assigned to the respective antennas, which are mutually orthogonal. The terminal<br>
compares the channel qualities of the antennas by the forward common channels<br>
assigned t the respective antenna, and transmits an antenna selection message to the<br>
base station to tell the base station to send data through the best channel quality<br>
antenna.<br>
In operation, the terminal measures the channel qualities of the antennas for<br>
a predetermined time, and sends the base station the antenna selection message for<br>
selecting a transmission antenna on the basis of the measurement. Here, the<br>
predetermined time is an integer multiple of a power control group (PCG). The<br>
base station sends the terminal an antenna reference signal indicative of an antenna<br>
in current use for transmission. Then, the terminal can detect the transmission<br>
quality of the antenna selection message by comparing the base station antenna<br>
used for current transmission data with the antenna selected by the terminal.<br>
FIG. 1 is a block diagram of a conventional STD transmitting device in<br>
which a common channel signal is transmitted through each transmission antenna<br>
and data is transmitted through, a transmission antenna selected based on an antenna<br>
selection message received from a terminal. In this example, two transmission<br>
antennas are associated with a base station.<br>
FIG. 2 illustrates the operation of the conventional STD transmitting device<br>
of FIG. 1, in which common channel signals are transmitted consistently through<br>
corresponding transmission antennas 151 and 153, and data is transmitted through a<br>
transmission antenna selected based on an antenna selection message received at a<br>
predetermined rate.<br>
Referring to FTGs. 1 and 2, first and second common channel transmitters 11<br>
and 12 are of the same configuration. They generate common channel signals to be<br>
transmitted via the first and second antennas 151 and 153, respectively. The first<br>
common channel transmitter 11 is comprised of a multiplexer 1 1 1 for multiplexing<br>
a pilot signal and data and a channel transmitter 113 for subjecting a common<br>
channel signal received from the multiplexer 1 11 to channel coding, rate matching,<br>
channel interleaving, orthogonal code modulation, and PN (Pseudo-Noise)<br>
sequence spreading. The second common channel transmitter 12 is comprised of a<br>
multiplexer 121 for multiplexing a pilot signal and data and a channel transmitter<br>
123 for subjecting a common channel signal received from the multiplexer 121 to<br>
channel coding, rate matching, channel interleaving, orthogonal code modulation,<br>
and PN sequence spreading.<br>
A traffic channel transmitter 13 generates traffic data to be transmitted from<br>
the STD transmitting device. In the traffic channel transmitter 13, a pilot selector<br>
135 generates a corresponding pilot signal in response to an antenna selection<br>
message AS fed back from the terminal. A multiplexer 131 multiplexes the pilot<br>
signal received from the pilot selector 135 and traffic channel data. A channel<br>
transmitter 133 subjects the traffic channel signal received from the multiplexer 131<br>
to orthogonal code modulation and PN sequence spreading.<br>
A switch 141 switches the traffic channel signal based on the antenna<br>
selection message AS, and has an input terminal coupled to the output terminal of<br>
the traffic channel transmitter 13, a first output terminal directed toward the first<br>
antenna 151, and a second output terminal directed toward the second antenna 153.<br>
Hence, the switch 141 switches the traffic channel signal to the first or second<br>
antenna 151 or 153 according to the antenna selection message AS. An adder 143<br>
adds a signal received from the first output terminal of the switch 141 and a signal<br>
received from the first common channel transmitter 11 to provide a signal indicated<br>
by 214 in FTG. 2. An adder 145 adds a signal received from the second output<br>
terminal of the switch 14] and a signal received from the second common channel<br>
transmitter 12 to provide a signal, indicated by 216 in FIG. 2. A first RF (Radio<br>
Frequency) transmitter 147 is coupled between the adder 143 and the first antenna<br>
151, and a second RF transmitter 149 between the adder 145 and the second<br>
antenna 153, for converting their corresponding transmit signals to RF signals.<br>
In the conventional STD operation, common channel signals to be<br>
transmitted through the antennas 151 and 153 are generated by multiplexing pilot<br>
symbols and data and subjecting the multiplexed signals to spectrum spreading. A<br>
traffic channel signal is generated by multiplexing a pilot symbol and data selected<br>
based on message AS and subjecting the multiplexed signals to spectrum spreading.<br>
The resulting traffic channel signal and a corresponding common channel signal are<br>
added into the signal as indicated by 214 or 216 of FIG. 2 to be transmitted via an<br>
antenna selected by the antenna selection message AS indicated by 212 of FIG. 2.<br>
Tine unselected antenna sends a common channel signal 214 or 216 alone.<br>
The above conventional technology, however, has the shortcoming that a<br>
base station always sends common channel signals through corresponding plural<br>
antennas. Since all the users in a cell do not own terminals adapted to STD,<br>
continuous transmission of the common channel signals for some STD terminals<br>
results in a waste of forward code resources and transmit power.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
An object of the present invention, therefore, is to provide a STD<br>
communicating device and method in a mobile communication system.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a STD transmitting<br>
device and method in a mobile communication system, in which a common channel<br>
signal is transmitted through a transmission antenna and a traffic channel signal is<br>
transmitted through a transmission antenna selected based on an antenna selection<br>
message, to thereby enable efficient use of forward code resources and transmit<br>
power.<br>
To achieve these and other objects, there is provided a STD communication<br>
device and method. In a STD communication method according to the present<br>
invention, a base station selects a transmission antenna corresponding to an antenna<br>
selection signal received from a terminal, transmits a traffic channel signal through<br>
the selected antenna, and transmits a predetermined part of the traffic channel signal<br>
through an unselected antenna.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
The present invention is directed to a CDMA (Code Division Multiple<br>
Access) mobile communication system with Selection Transmit Diversity (STD) to<br>
efficiently use forward code resources and transmit power. To do this, a base<br>
station sends a common channel signal through one of a plurality of antennas, and a<br>
traffic channel signal through any of the antennas regardless of antenna selection<br>
based on an antenna selection message in order to allow a terminal to measure<br>
channel qualities. The segments of a signal to be transmitted via an imselected<br>
antenna are known to both the base station and the terminal. This can be devised in<br>
accordance with a preset standard through product design or mutual appointment<br>
during a call set-up. The channel qualities of transmit signals from antennas are<br>
measured in the terminal by analyzing predetermined symbols of a traffic channel,<br>
which are differently assigned to the respective antennas.<br>
Before presenting a complete description of the present invention, the key<br>
terms used to set forth the invention, are listed below.<br>
Common channel: a channel used by a terminal to detect a base station and<br>
measure its receive level; traffic channel: a channel for transmitting a control signal<br>
or data between a base station and a terminal; antenna selection message (AS): a<br>
message commanding a traffic channel signal to be transmitted through the antenna<br>
exhibiting good reception quality according to measurement of the channel qualities<br>
at the terminal; pilot symbol: a transmission symbol for providing time<br>
synchronization and demodulation needed to receive other signals and enabling a<br>
terminal to identify a currently used antenna due to its orthogonal pattern for each<br>
antenna in a STD mobile communication system; PCG (Power Control Group): a<br>
duration time for controlling forward link power in a base station; frame: the size of<br>
unit data to be transmitted, consisting of "N" PCGs (herein, 16 PCGs); and<br>
subframe: the size of unit data transmitted before switching antennas determined by<br>
the AS message, consisting of an integer times the PCG (that is, "M." PCGs). A<br>
single frame includes a plurality of subframes. In the embodiments of the present<br>
invention, a frame has 4 subframes, and each subframe has 4 PCGs.<br>
Referring now to FIG. 3, FIG. 3 is a block diagram of an STD transmitting<br>
device according to an embodiment of the present invention. The common channel<br>
is transmitted only through a single antenna, and the traffic channel is transmitted<br>
through an antenna selected based on an antenna selection message. In FIG. 3, the<br>
common channel signal is output through a first antenna 351.<br>
In FIG. 3, a common channel transmitter 31 generates the common channel<br>
signal which is to be transmitted through the first antenna 351. In the common<br>
channel transmitter 31, a multiplexer 311 multiplexes an input pilot signal and data.<br>
A channel transmitter 313 includes at least a channel coder, a rate matcher, a<br>
channel interleave!", an orthogonal code modulator, and a PN sequence spreader, for<br>
converting a common channel signal received from the multiplexer 311 to a signal<br>
for transmission.<br>
A traffic channel transmitter 32 generates traffic data to be transmitted from<br>
the STD transmitting device. Tn the traffic channel transmitter 32, a pilot selector<br>
325 generates a pilot signal according to an antenna selection message AS fed back<br>
from a terminal. A multiplexer 321 multiplexes the pilot signal received from the<br>
pilot selector 325 and data. A channel transmitter 323 includes at least an<br>
orthogonal code modulator and a PN sequence spreader, for converting a traffic<br>
channel signal received from the multiplexer 321 to a signal for transmission.<br>
A switch 333 receives input from an input terminal coupled to an output<br>
terminal of the traffic channel transmitter 32, and outputs through a first output<br>
terminal directed to the first antenna 35 1, and a second output terminal directed to a<br>
second antenna 353, and is controlled by the antenna selection message AS. Thus,<br>
in this embodiment, the switch 333 switches between the first and second antennas<br>
351 and 353 according to the antenna selection message AS. An adder 335 adds a<br>
signal received from the switch 333 to the common channel signal received from<br>
the common channel transmitter 31. A first RF transmitter 337 is coupled between<br>
the adder 335 and the first antenna 351, and a second RF transmitter 339 between<br>
the switch 333 and the second antenna 353, for converting their respective received<br>
signals to RF signals.<br>
FIG. 4 illustrates a subframe of the traffic channel signal output from the<br>
channel transmitter 323. Here, it is assumed that 4 PCGs are assigned to each<br>
subframe as indicated by 411. A PCG has a pilot symbol, a power control bit (PCB<br>
or TPC: Transmit Power Control command), rate information (RI), and data. The<br>
pilot symbol is a code mutually appointed between a base station and a terminal and<br>
can be used for the terminal to measure transmit power of the base station. The<br>
PCB is information for controlling signal strength in a PCG unit, and RI indicates<br>
the transmission rate of a signal from the base station.<br>
Referring to FIGs. 3 and 4, the common channel signal is generated by<br>
multiplexing a pilot symbol and data in the multiplexer 311 and subjecting the<br>
multiplexed signal to spreading and modulation in the channel transmitter 313.<br>
Then, the adder 335 adds the common channel signal to the traffic channel signal<br>
which is to be transmitted through the first antenna 35 1. The traffic channel signal<br>
is generated by multiplexing a pilot signal and data to be transmitted in the<br>
multiplexer 321 and subjecting the multiplexed signal to spreading and modulation<br>
in the channel transmitter 323. The transmit signal output from the traffic channel<br>
transmitter 323 has the format of FIG. 4. Then, the switch 333 selects a<br>
transmission path for the traffic channel signal based on the antenna selection<br>
message AS received from the terminal and outputs the traffic channel signal<br>
through the first or second antenna 351 or 353.<br>
A controller 331 controls the switch 333, and can switch a data subframe<br>
unit, thereby outputting segments of, or whole, or several predetermined PCG<br>
through an antenna other than the antenna currently transmitting the traffic channel<br>
signal. The switch 333 switches the pilot symbol of a predetermined PCG or a<br>
predetermined PCG signal of the traffic channel signal to the unused antenna under<br>
the control of the controller 331. For example, while the traffic channel signal is<br>
transmitted through the first antenna 35] in a subframe unit as shown in FTG. 4, the<br>
pilot symbol of a predetermined PCG or a predetermined PCG signal in a<br>
corresponding subframe is output through the second antenna 353. Therefore, the<br>
STD transmitting device outputs a traffic channel signal in a subframe unit through<br>
a selected antenna and, at the same time, the pilot symbol of a predetermined PCG<br>
in a corresponding subframe through an unselected antenna, so that the terminal can<br>
compare the channel qualities of the antennas, by using the traffic channel instead<br>
of the common channel.<br>
A receiving device for receiving the traffic channel signal from the plurality<br>
of antennas of the STD transmitting device analyzes the qualities of transmit signals<br>
from the respective antennas and generates an antenna selection message for<br>
instructing the base station to transmit the traffic channel signal via an antenna<br>
showing a good channel quality. FIG. 5 is a block diagram of a receiving device<br>
for receiving a transmit signal from the STD transmitting device of the present<br>
invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 5, an RF receiver 511 receives an RF signal from the STD<br>
base station. A channel receiver 513 despreads and demodulates the signal<br>
received from the RF receiver 511 and feeds the resulting signal to a signal<br>
processor and a switch 517.<br>
A controller 515 controls the switch 517 in the same manner as from the<br>
controller 331 of the base station. That is, the controller 515 selects a path for the<br>
traffic channel signal in a subframe unit, and generates the switch control signal for<br>
separating sections of a corresponding subframe. In this way, the device can<br>
discriminate between a signal of a selected antenna and a signal of an unselected<br>
antenna. Switch 517 switches the signal received from the channel receiver 51.3<br>
through a first or second output terminal under the control of the controller 515. In<br>
the example of FIG. 4, the switch 517 separately outputs the pilot symbols of the<br>
traffic channel signal, which were transmitted through the unselected antenna to a<br>
different power measurer than the rest of the data subframe. Here, the switch 517<br>
may be a demultiplexer.<br>
First and second power measurers 519 and 521 measure the power of<br>
signals received from the first and second output terminals of the switch 517,<br>
respectively. They measure power levels in different ways. That is, the power<br>
measurers 5 19 and 521 differ in power measuring duration depending upon their<br>
received signal segments, and obtain the respective average values of the signal<br>
power levels measured for different duration, in such a way that the measurement<br>
of signal power levels can be said to be performed under the same condition. For<br>
this purpose, the power measurers 519 and 521 may be so configured as to measure<br>
the power of a signal transmitted through a selected antenna or an unselected<br>
antenna in subframe units. In this case, a power measurer for receiving a signal,<br>
through a selected antenna under the control of the controller 515 measures the<br>
received PCG signals and then averages them to be expressed in terms of signals<br>
transmitted through an unselected antenna. A. comparator 523 compares the outputs<br>
of the first and second power measurers 519 and 521 and generates the antenna<br>
selection message AS, which is applied to an upper-level processor and a<br>
multiplexer 525. Here, the first and second power measurers 519 and 521 and the<br>
comparator 523 may be configured to be a decision unit for generating an antenna<br>
selection signal.<br>
Then, the multiplexer 525 multiplexes an input reverse link transmit data<br>
signal and the output of the comparator 523, and a channel transmitter 527 encodes<br>
and modulates the output of the multiplexer 525. An RF transmitter 529 converts a<br>
transmit signal received from the channel transmitter 527 to an RF signal for<br>
transmission.<br>
FIG. 6 illustrates the format of a transmit signal output from the multiplexer<br>
525 of the terminal. Tn FIG. 6, reference numeral 622 denotes a traffic channel<br>
signal transmitted from the terminal to the base station in a subframe unit, and<br>
reference numeral 624 denotes a PCG in a subframe. As indicated by 622, the<br>
terminal inserts the antenna selection message AS in the PCB area of a<br>
predetermined PCG. Tn the embodiments of the present invention, a subframe<br>
includes 4 PCGs, and the antenna selection message AS is inserted in the PCB area<br>
of the last PCG in each subframe.<br>
In summary, FIGs. 5 and 6 describe the receiving device of a terminal which<br>
supports STD. The channel receiver 513 despreads and demodulates an input<br>
traffic channel signal, and the switch 517 separately outputs a signal transmitted<br>
from a selected antenna and a signal transmitted from an unselected antenna under<br>
the control of the controller 5 ] 5. The first and second power measurers 519 and<br>
521 measure the powers of their corresponding signals received from the switch<br>
517. The comparator 523 compares the outputs of the power measurers 519 and<br>
521 and generates the antenna selection message AS for selecting an antenna<br>
showing a better channel quality.<br>
The multiplexer 525 multiplexes the antenna selection message AS and<br>
traffic channel data. Here, the multiplexer 525 inserts the antenna selection<br>
message AS in the PCB area of a predetermined PCG. for example, the fourth PCG<br>
in each subframe, as indicated by 622 of FIG. 6 in the embodiments of the present<br>
invention. The channel transmitter 527 encodes and spreads the signal received<br>
from the multiplexer 525 and outputs the resulting signal as a reverse link RF signal<br>
through the RF transmitter 529.<br>
FIGs. 7, 8, and 9 show the different sizes of switched sections in a STD<br>
communication system according to first to third embodiments of the present<br>
invention. In the description of the drawings, a common channel signal is assumed<br>
to be transmitted through the first antenna 351 alone.<br>
FIG. 7 shows a STD operation mode according to the first embodiment of<br>
the present invention. In FIG. 7, the common channel is confined to one antenna<br>
for transmission, intended data is transmitted through an antenna selected by an<br>
antenna selection message, and a pilot symbol in a predetermined position of each<br>
subframe is transmitted through an unselected antenna. That is, the pilot symbol of<br>
a predetermined PCG in a subframe having four PCGs is transmitted through an<br>
antenna other than one selected based on the antenna selection message. The<br>
remaining signal of the predetermined PCG except for the pilot symbol is<br>
transmitted through the selected antenna, and the pilot symbol is transmitted<br>
through the nnselected antenna.<br>
Referring back to FTG. 3, in the first embodiment of the present invention,<br>
the output of the common channel 31 is fed to the first antenna 351 alone, through<br>
the adder 335. The switch 333 is coupled toward an antenna through which the<br>
output of the traffic channel transmitter 32 is to be transmitted by the antenna<br>
selection message AS received from a terminal as indicated by 711 in FIG. 7. If the<br>
antenna selection message AS indicates the first antenna 351, the switch 333<br>
switches the output of the traffic channel transmitter 32 to the adder 335. Then, the<br>
common channel signal and the traffic channel signal added in the adder 335 as<br>
indicated by 713 are transmitted through the first antenna 351. Here, a PCG of the<br>
traffic channel signal has a format as indicated by 413 of FIG. 4 and one subframe<br>
includes four PCGs as indicated by 411 of FTG. 4. Therefore, the traffic channel<br>
signal in which one PCG has a pilot symbol, PCB, RI, and data is transmitted<br>
together with the common channel signal through the first antenna 351.<br>
In this embodiment, the controller 331 switches the traffic channel in order<br>
to transmit the pilot symbol of a predetermined PCG in a subframe through an<br>
unselected antenna. Assuming that the pilot symbol of the third PCG in a subframe<br>
is to be transmitted through the unselected antenna, the controller 331 directs the<br>
switch 333 to send the pilot symbol of the third PCG to the imselected second<br>
antenna 353 as indicated by 715 of FIG. 7 although the rest of the traffic channel<br>
signal is transmitted through the first antenna 35 J.<br>
Referring to FIG. 5, upon reception of the first subframe of the traffic<br>
channel signal shown in FIG. 7, the RF receiver 511 of the receiving device<br>
converts the received signal to a baseband signal, and the channel receiver 513<br>
despreads the output of the RF receiver 511. The output of the channel receiver<br>
513 is fed to the signal processor and the switch 517. The switch (demultiplexer)<br>
5 17 selectively outputs the received signal under the control of the controller 515<br>
which generates the same switch controlling signal as from the controller 33 1 of the<br>
transmitting device. Thus, the switch 5 17 feeds the traffic channel signal from the<br>
antenna selected in a subframe unit and the pilot symbol of the predetermined PCG<br>
to different corresponding power measurers 519 and 521. The controller 515 and<br>
the switch 517 function to separately output the traffic channel signal from the<br>
selected antenna and the traffic channel signal from the unselected antenna.<br>
Then, the first and second power measurers 519 and 521 measure the powers<br>
of signals received from the switch 5.17, respectively. They can detect their<br>
corresponding signals in subframes or pilot symbols from the controller 515. The<br>
power measurers 519 and 521 differ in power measuring duration depending upon<br>
their received signal segments, and obtain the respective average values of the<br>
signal power levels measured for different duration, in such a way that the<br>
measurement of signal power levels can be said to be performed under the same<br>
condition. The comparator 523 compares the outputs of the first and second power<br>
measurers 519 and 521 and generates the antenna selection message AS. If the<br>
signal quality of the second antenna 353 is better, the comparator 523 generates the<br>
antenna selection message for selecting the second antenna 353.<br>
Upon generation of the antenna selection message AS for selecting the<br>
second antenna 353 from the terminal, the switch 333 switches the output of the<br>
traffic channel transmitter 32 to the RF transmitter 339. Then, the traffic channel<br>
signal in the second subframe is transmitted through the second antenna 353, and<br>
the third pilot symbol of the subframe is transmitted through the first antenna 35 1,<br>
as indicated by 715 of FIG. 7. The output of the common channel transmitter 31 is<br>
consistently transmitted through the first antenna 35 1 as described above.<br>
Therefore, in the STD operation according to the first embodiment of the<br>
present invention, the traffic channel, signal of a corresponding subframe is output<br>
based on the antenna selection message AS received from the terminal, as indicated<br>
by 711 of FIG. 7. As indicated by 713 and 715, the traffic channel signal of a<br>
corresponding subframe is transmitted through a selected antenna, and the pilot<br>
symbol of a predetermined PCG through an unselected antenna. In conclusion, the<br>
common channel signal is transmitted through an antenna alone, data through an<br>
antenna selected by an antenna selection message, and the pilot symbol in a<br>
predetermined location of each subframe through an unselected antenna.<br>
FIG. 8 shows a STD operation mode according to the second embodiment of<br>
the present invention. In FIG. 8, the common channel signal is confined to one<br>
antenna for transmission, intended data is transmitted through an antemia selected<br>
by an antenna selection message, and a PCG in a predetermined position of each<br>
subframe is transmitted through an unselected antenna. That is, one of four PCGs<br>
in a subframe is transmitted through the unselected antenna in this embodiment.<br>
Thus, the remaining PCGs of the subframe except for the predetermined PCG are<br>
transmitted through the selected antenna.<br>
Referring to FIGs. 3 and 8, the output of the common channel 3 1 is fed to<br>
the first antenna 351 alone, through the adder 335. The switch 333 is coupled<br>
toward an antenna through which the output of the traffic channel transmitter 32 is<br>
to be transmitted based on the antenna selection message AS received from a<br>
terminal as indicated by 812. If the antenna selection message AS indicates the first<br>
antenna 351, the switch 333 switches the output of the traffic channel transmitter 32<br>
to the adder 335. Then, the common channel signal and the traffic channel signal<br>
added in the adder 335 as indicated by 814 are transmitted through the first antenna<br>
351. Here, a PCG of the traffic channel signal has a format as indicated by 43 3 of<br>
FIG. 4 and one subframe includes four PCGs as indicated by 411 of FTG. 4.<br>
Therefore, the traffic channel signal in subframe units is transmitted together with<br>
the common channel signal through the first antenna 351.<br>
In this embodiment, the controller 331 switches the traffic channel in order<br>
to transmit a predetermined PCG of a subframe through an unselected antenna.<br>
Assuming that the third PCG in a subframe is to be transmitted through the<br>
unselected antenna, the controller 331 controls the switch 333 to send the third<br>
PCG to the unselected second antenna 353 as indicated by 816 of FIG. 8 although<br>
the rest of the traffic channel signal is transmitted through the first antenna 351.<br>
With reference to FIG. 5, upon reception of the first subframe of the traffic<br>
channel signal shown in FIG. 8, the RF receiver 511 of the receiving device<br>
converts the received signal to a baseband signal, and the channel receiver 513<br>
despreads and demodulates the output of the RF receiver 511. The output of the<br>
channel receiver 513 is fed to the signal processor and the switch 517. The switch<br>
5 17 selectively outputs the received signal under the control of the controller 515<br>
which generates the same switch controlling signal as from the controller 33 1 of the<br>
transmitting device. Thus, the switch 517 feeds the traffic channel signal from the<br>
antenna selected in a subframe unit and the predetermined PCG to different<br>
corresponding power measurers 519 and 521. The controller 5 15 and the switch<br>
517 function to separately output the traffic channel signal from the selected<br>
antenna and the traffic channel signal from the unselected antenna.<br>
Then, the first and second power measurers 519 and 521 measure the powers<br>
of signals received from the switch 517, respectively. They can detect their<br>
corresponding signals in subframes or pilot symbols from the controller 515. The<br>
power measurers 519 and 521 differ in power measuring duration depending upon<br>
their received signal segments, and obtain the respective average values of the<br>
signal power levels measured for different duration. Then, the comparator 523<br>
compares the outputs of the first and second power measurers 519 and 521 and<br>
generates the antenna selection message AS for selecting a better quality antenna.<br>
If the signal quality of the second antenna 353 is better, the comparator 523<br>
generates the antenna selection message for selecting the second antenna 353.<br>
Upon generation of the antenna selection message AS for selecting the<br>
second antenna 353 from the terminal, the switch 333 switches the output of the<br>
traffic channel transmitter 32 to the RF transmitter 339. Then, the traffic channel<br>
signal in the second subframe is transmitted through the second antenna 353, and<br>
the third PCG of the subframe is transmitted through the first antenna 351. as<br>
shown in FIG 8. The output of the common channel transmitter 31 is consistently<br>
transmitted through the first antenna 351 as described above.<br>
Therefore, in the STD operation according to the second embodiment of the<br>
present invention, the traffic channel signal of a corresponding subframe is output<br>
based on the antenna selection message AS received from the terminal, as indicated<br>
by 812 of FIG. 8. As indicated by 814 and 816, the traffic channel signal of a<br>
corresponding subframe is transmitted through a selected antenna, and a<br>
predetermined PCG of the subframe through an unselected antenna. In conclusion,<br>
the common channel signal is transmitted through a predetermined antenna alone,<br>
data through an antenna selected by an antenna selection message, and a PCG<br>
signal in a predetermined location of each subframe through an unselected antenna.<br>
FIG. 9 shows a STD operation mode according to the third embodiment of<br>
the present invention. In FIG. 9, the common channel signal is confined to one<br>
antenna for transmission, part of a traffic channel signal is transmitted through an<br>
antenna selected by an antenna selection message AS, and the remaining traffic<br>
channel signal is transmitted through an unselected antenna. That is, two of four<br>
PCGs in a subframe are transmitted through the selected antenna and the other two<br>
PCGs through the unselected antenna in this embodiment. Thus, a half of the PCGs<br>
in a subframe are transmitted through the selected antenna, and the remaining half<br>
of the PCGs through the unselected antenna.<br>
Referring to FTGs. 3 and 9, the output of the common channel 3] is fed to<br>
the first antenna 351 alone, through the adder 335. The switch 333 is coupled<br>
toward an antenna through which the output of the traffic channel transmitter 32 is<br>
to be transmitted by the antenna selection message AS received from a terminal as<br>
indicated by 911. If the antenna selection message AS indicates the first antenna<br>
351, the switch 333 switches the output of the traffic channel transmitter 32 to the<br>
adder 335. Then, the common channel signal and the traffic channel signal are<br>
transmitted tlirough the first antenna 351 as indicated by 913.<br>
In this embodiment, the controller 331 switches the traffic channel in order<br>
to transmit the remaining PCGs of a subframe via an unselected antenna. When the<br>
first and second PCGs in a subframe are transmitted via the first antenna 315, the<br>
controller 331 directs the switch 333 to send the third and fourth PCGs to the<br>
unselected second antenna 353 as indicated by 915 of FIG. 9.<br>
Therefore, in the STD operation according to the third embodiment of the<br>
present invention, the traffic channel signal is output based on the antenna selection<br>
message AS received from the terminal, as indicated by 911 of FTG. 9. As<br>
indicated by 913 and 915, the first half of PCGs in a corresponding subframe are<br>
transmitted through a selected antenna, and the last half of PCGs through an<br>
unselected antenna. In conclusion, the common channel signal is transmitted<br>
through a predetermined antenna alone, the first half of PCGs in a subframe<br>
through an antenna selected by an antenna selection message, and the other half of<br>
PCGs through an unselected antenna.<br>
While the embodiments of the present invention have been described in<br>
which switching of antennas is controlled in subframe units in an STD mobile<br>
communication system, the switching period ma)" be a power control period or a<br>
frame period.<br>
Further, signals are transmitted through a selected antenna and an unselected<br>
antenna with the same transmit power in the embodiments of the present invention.<br>
Yet, the transmit power of the unselected antenna can be varied. Tn this case, the<br>
power measurer of the receiving device determines the power ratios of transmit<br>
signals output from the antennas and measures the power levels of received signals<br>
in consideration of the power ratios.<br>
The transmit signal via the unselected antenna is given as the pilot symbol of<br>
a predetermined PCG in the first embodiment, a predetermined PCG signal in the<br>
second embodiment, and a half of PCGs in a subframe in the third embodiment.<br>
But the pilot symbols of a plurality of PCGs can be transmitted through the<br>
unselected antenna in the first embodiment, and a plurality of PCGs in the second<br>
embodiment.<br>
As described above, a traffic channel signal is transmitted via an antenna<br>
having a good channel quality, a predetermined PCG or the pilot symbol of a<br>
predetermined PCG is transmitted through an unselected antenna, and a receiving<br>
device measures the strengths of signals received from the antennas to select an<br>
antenna of a good reception quality in the STD method according to the present<br>
invention. Therefore, the traffic channel signal is transmitted through the good<br>
quality antenna alone. Also, since a common channel signal is output through only<br>
one predetermined antenna, channel efficiency and power efficiency are increased.<br>
While the present invention has been described in detail with reference to the<br>
specific embodiments, they are mere exemplary applications. Thus, it is to be<br>
clearly understood that many variations can be made by anyone skilled in the art<br>
within the scope and spirit of the present invention.<br>
