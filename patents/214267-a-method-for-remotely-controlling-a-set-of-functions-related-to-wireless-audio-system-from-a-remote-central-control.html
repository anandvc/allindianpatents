				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a method for remotely controlling a set of<br>
functions related to a wireless audio system from a remote central control and,<br>
more specially, to a method for monitoring and remotely controlling a wireless<br>
audio source via a communication network.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Modem audio communication systems, such as microphone systems,<br>
provide a reliable infrastructure to transmit voice signals. A wireless microphone<br>
system generally comprises an acoustic source such as a microphone and a<br>
receiver that are linked to each other via a transmitter. The transmitter therefore<br>
facilitates a wireless link between the acoustic energy from the audio source and the<br>
receiver.<br>
These audio components, i.e. the microphone, transmitter and<br>
receiver, are commonly available in the audio industry. The microphone is an audio<br>
transducer in which acoustic energy from a sound source is converted into electric<br>
output through an oscillating element that oscillates in response to the transmitted<br>
acoustic energy. The electric output is fed to the transmitter.<br>
[0005] The transmitter is wireless, and is available either as a handheld device<br>
or as a body pack. The transmitter sends the-microphone"s electric output to the<br>
receiver via a signal transmission captured by the receiver"s antenna. The signal<br>
transmission may be, for example, a Radio Frequency (RF) signal, and a pilot tone is<br>
provided to so that the receiver can recognize the signal that is being sent from the<br>
transmitter that carries the microphone output.<br>
[0006] The receivers can be either a diversity or a non-diversity system.<br>
Diversity wireless receiver systems are highly desirable because they effectively<br>
combat the most common problem with wireless microphone equipment, namely<br>
signal dropouts due to multi-path. Diversity wireless systems also almost always<br>
have better operating range than similar non-diversity systems.<br>
[0007] Wireless receivers must have either one or two external antennas, and<br>
there should be a clear open-air path between these antennas and the transmitter"s<br>
antenna. Every wireless microphone system operates on a specific frequency. The<br>
government dictates which frequency ranges can be used by wireless systems. By<br>
government policy, all frequencies are shared by a large number of users across the<br>
country. There must be one transmitter and one receiver to make a complete<br>
wireless system, and they both must be on the same frequency.<br>
[0008] The performance of such wireless microphone systems typically is<br>
tested and evaluated at the physical location of their audio components, or at a<br>
distant testing and repairing facility. However, both of these situations introduce their<br>
respective disadvantages in that they require either a shipment of the wireless<br>
microphone components to the distant facility, or require an arrangement for the<br>
physical presence of a qualified technical individual at the location where the<br>
wireless microphone system is being used.<br>
[0009] Recommended Standard (RS) 232 is a commonly utilized standard for<br>
serial communications in information handling systems. RS-232 has been around as<br>
a standard for decades as an electrical interface between Data Terminal Equipment<br>
(DTE) and Data Circuit-Terminating Equipment (DCE). Examples of DTEs include<br>
Personal Computers (PCs), workstations, file servers, or print servers that, as a<br>
group, are all often referred to as end stations. Examples of DCEs include<br>
intermediate network devices that receive and forward data frames across a network<br>
that are either (i) standalone devices such as repeaters, network switches, and<br>
routers or (ii) communications interface units such as interface cards and modems.<br>
RS-232 is used for asynchronous data transfer as well as synchronous links.<br>
[00010] The Ethernet has replaced serial ports to dominate the way computers<br>
communicate, and has become the communications method of choice. For<br>
example, Ethernet Local Area Networks (LANs) consist of network nodes and<br>
interconnecting media. The network nodes fall into two major classes: DTEs and<br>
DCEs. Typically micro-controller based projects communicate over 10base T<br>
Ethernet or higher, and Ethernet boards allow data traffic to and from the Internet.<br>
The Internet is only one type of a communication network. Other communication<br>
networks may be Local Area Networks (LAN), Wide Area Networks (WAN),<br>
Integrated Services Digital Networks (ISDN), wireless networks, and other similar<br>
networks to transfer data between two points.<br>
The object of the present invention is to overcome the drawbacks of the<br>
conventional techniques in the related field of the invention. The invention relates<br>
to a method for remotely controlling a set of functions related to a wireless audio<br>
system from a remote central control, and, to a method for monitoring and<br>
remotely controlling a wireless audio source via a communication network.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a method for remotely<br>
controlling a set of functions related to a wireless audio system from a remote<br>
central control, said method comprising the steps of:<br>
providing an audio system that comprises a transmitter and a receiver;<br>
transmitting data from the transmitter to the receiver of said audio system<br>
and storing said data therein, said data having two or more characteristics<br>
regarding said transmitter or the environment in which it is used;<br>
establishing a link between the receiver of said wireless audio system and<br>
a central control;<br>
determining whether or not any problems exist by monitoring said data<br>
stored in said receiver from said central control;<br>
communicating from said remote control to said audio system appropriate<br>
remedial actions to alleviate any of said problems.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
[00021] While the present invention is susceptible of embodiments in various<br>
forms, there is shown in the drawings and will hereinafter be described a presently<br>
preferred embodiment with the understanding that the present disclosure is to be<br>
considered an exemplification of the invention and is not intended to limit the<br>
invention to the specific embodiments illustrated.<br>
[00022] It should be further understood that the title of this section of this<br>
specification, namely, "Detailed Description of the Invention", relates to a<br>
requirement of the United States Patent Office, and does not imply, nor should it be<br>
inferred to limit the subject matter disclosed herein.<br>
[00023] In the present disclosure, the words "a" or "an" are to be taken to<br>
include both the singular and the plural. Conversely, any reference to plural items<br>
shall, where appropriate, include the singular.<br>
[00024] By using, for example, Ethernet remote control of an audio system<br>
such as a wireless microphone, the following functions can be monitored: receiver<br>
Internet Protocol (IP) address, receiver link address, receiver RF level, and receiver<br>
AF level. In addition, the following functions can also be controlled: receiver name,<br>
receiver frequency, receiver squelch level, receiver meter hold (on/off), receiver<br>
antenna power (on/off), receiver mute (on/off), default display on receiver state,<br>
receiver lock condition, and receiver load/save preset. This is especially<br>
advantageous because, for example, problems with audio systems such as wireless<br>
microphone systems can be remotely monitored and diagnosed without the need to<br>
have the microphone system shipped back to the manufacturer.<br>
[00025] In an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, a pilot tone, that<br>
is used to allow a wireless receiver to recognize the transmitter signal, is digitally<br>
modulated to contain additional information related to the transmitter and the<br>
corresponding audio source such as a wireless microphone. This additional<br>
information can include, for example, the transmitter name, transmitter type (hand-<br>
held or belt-pack), capsule type (condenser or dynamic), input type (microphone or<br>
instrument), transmitter gain setting, transmitter power (high or low), battery level,<br>
state of transmitter lock mode, state of transmitter mute condition, transmitter preset<br>
name. This list can be added to the list of monitored functions, already detailed<br>
above.<br>
[00026] Important features of the present invention include, for example, the<br>
use of robust web-based technologies to monitor and control the plurality of<br>
enumerated functions of the wireless audio system in real time. Specifically, the<br>
invention enables, for example, remote diagnosis, performance tracking, tuning, and<br>
adjustment of the wireless audio system from a remote location. Further, the<br>
present invention enables, in an exemplary application, remote troubleshooting and<br>
debugging. Indeed, in case a component defect is detected, the remote central<br>
control can check whether a remote-fix is possible. If not, the remote central control<br>
can alert a local technician to attend to the problem on a real time basis. If the<br>
problem is too complicated to be fixed locally, the defective component is removed<br>
for repairs at an appropriate technical control.<br>
[00027] FIG. 1 is an exemplary communication network 100 illustrating an<br>
embodiment of the overall operation that may be used to provide an understanding<br>
of the method of monitoring and controlling a wireless audio source. In this<br>
exemplary communication network, a remote central control 102 is coupled via the<br>
Internet 104 to a number of wireless microphone systems 106. This structure<br>
provides for a bi-directional communication between the remote central control 102<br>
and the wireless microphone systems 106. This structure also allows for data that<br>
was captured via wireless mode by the wireless systems 106 to be provided to the<br>
central control 102 located remotely from the audio source, and the central control<br>
102 can in turn provide to the wireless systems 106 corrective measures for<br>
controllable components. This data provided on a continuous real time basis over<br>
the Internet 104, could also be sent via a cellular network from the wireless<br>
microphone systems 106 to the Internet 104, and from the Internet 104 to the remote<br>
central control 102.<br>
[00028] FIG. 2 is a schematic block diagram of an example of a portion of the<br>
wireless audio system 106 shown in FIG. 1. In this exemplary application, wireless<br>
audio system 106 comprises a wireless microphone system in which acoustic signals<br>
are picked up by an acoustic transducer 108, such as a microphone or a musical<br>
instrument. These signals are feed to a transmitter 110. The transmitter 110<br>
converts the audio signals to a radio signal, and broadcasts it via an antenna 111 to<br>
a surrounding area. The broadcast is accomplished by using the acoustic signal to<br>
modulate a radio carrier and transmit the resulting radio signal effectively. The<br>
transmitter 110 is therefore equipped with a circuitry designed to process the audio<br>
signal conversion, the modulation and the broadcast of the radio signal. As part of<br>
the radio communication, an additional signal, called a pilot tone, is communicated to<br>
the wireless receiver. This pilot tone is created by a pilot tone generator 112, and<br>
carries typically information related exclusively to the frequency of the radio signal<br>
being broadcasted by the transmitter 110. A battery 114 or other suitable power<br>
source is included to provide electrical power.<br>
[00029] The microphone system 106 includes a power switch, a mute switch, a<br>
gain adjustment, and a frequency selector (not shown). Whereas the status of these<br>
controls is typically logged locally, in the present invention the pilot tone is digitally<br>
modulated and programmed to communicate the status of these controls to a<br>
wireless receiver as discussed in greater detail hereinafter. The list of controls that<br>
this digitally modulated pilot tone communicates includes further information such as,<br>
for example, the transmitter name, the transmitter type, the capsule type, the input<br>
type, the level of battery 114 and the transmitter preset name.<br>
[00030] Figs 3A and 3B are schematic block diagrams of two wireless<br>
microphone systems 300 and 301 that incorporate aspects of the present invention.<br>
Systems 300 allow for the sending of information in the form of a radio signal<br>
between the transmitters 310 or 316 and the receivers 314. This information is<br>
converted to a radio signal, transmitted, received and converted back to its original<br>
form. In the present invention, the transmission incorporates the digitally modulated<br>
pilot tone, which communicates the additional information, detailed above, about the<br>
audio source 302 and the transmitters 310 or 316.<br>
[00031] One function of the receivers 314 is to provide a first stage of radio<br>
frequency filtering to prevent unwanted radio signals from causing interferences.<br>
They should effectively reject signals, which have frequencies substantially above or<br>
below the operating frequency broadcasted by the transmitters 310 or 316. The list<br>
of controls sent via the digitally modulated pilot tone is logged for monitoring<br>
purposes. As indicated earlier, the receivers 314 have a corresponding list of<br>
functions that can be controlled remotely. These two lists of functions can be<br>
communicated to the central control 102 via the Internet 104. This communication of<br>
the functions between the receivers 314 and the Internet 104 is facilitated by the<br>
additional components introduced above, i.e. the RS232 and the Ethernet boards.<br>
[00032] Fig. 4 is a block diagram of an embodiment of the wireless receiver 314<br>
shown in Figs. 3A and 3B. In an exemplary embodiment, receiver 314 comprises an<br>
"AEW-5200 Wireless" receiver that is commercially available on the market from<br>
Audio Technica USA, Inc. Acoustic signals picked up by microphones or created by<br>
musical instruments are transmitted by wireless transmitters, such as the handheld<br>
402 or the body-pack 404, in a wireless mode to diversity receivers 412 and 414.<br>
[00033] Wireless transmission signals, typically RF signals, are communicated<br>
via antennas 406. These RF transmitted signals are picked up by antennas 408,<br>
which are affixed to diversity receivers A and B, 412 and 410. Diversity receivers<br>
412 and 410 are able to avoid signal dropouts due to multi-path because they<br>
include two antennas and two receiver channels. Special circuits in the receivers<br>
select the audio from antennas 408 and receiver channel with the best signal.<br>
Because the chances that there will be simultaneous dropouts at both antennas 408<br>
are extremely low, diversity receivers 412 and 410 provide almost complete<br>
immunity from dropouts due to multi-path.<br>
[00034] Diversity operation can also improve the useful operating range for<br>
wireless systems. This is because even when there are no actual total dropouts,<br>
multi-path effects can reduce the amount of signal available at long ranges. This can<br>
cause the receiver to briefly lose audio well before the transmitter 402 is truly out of<br>
range. With diversity, complete signal loss is much less likely and the useful<br>
operating range of the wireless system will be extended. In addition a logic device<br>
420 coupled to both diversity receivers A 412 and B 410, can enhance the selection<br>
of a received RF signal with the best signal to noise ratio. This selection of the best<br>
diversity receiver, A 412 or B 410, is performed continuously and seamlessly for the<br>
duration of the audio transmission.<br>
[00035] As the transmitted signal is being selected by either diversity receiver A<br>
412, or by diversity receiver B 410 because of its signal strength, sensors monitoring<br>
specific functions of the transmitters and the receivers assemble a predefined data<br>
list. This predefined data list includes the plurality of functions identified earlier. This<br>
data list is communicated to an RS232 converter 414. The RS converters 414<br>
convert the data received from the receivers A 412 and B 410 to the Ethernet board<br>
416. This Ethernet board 416 then facilitates the transmission of the converted data<br>
in form of data frames through the Internet 104 to the remote central control 102<br>
(Fig. 1).<br>
[00036] Once the data reaches the remote central control 102, it is diagnosed<br>
to evaluate the status of the monitored functions. The data acquisition may contain<br>
logic that allows a notification, such as an alarm, for any monitored function<br>
whenever its corresponding notification characteristics are met. In the case of a<br>
controllable function, appropriate controls are communicated back to the wireless<br>
control system to adjust or rectify accordingly the controllable function.<br>
[00037] In the case of a non-controllable monitored function, the condition of<br>
this monitored non-controllable function may be communicated directly to an<br>
individual on location for immediate attention, or logged in a for future repair<br>
assignments.<br>
[00038] The system of the present invention includes the remote central<br>
control, the communication network, and can allow for a number of wireless control<br>
systems. This system is only limited by the capacity of the remote central control<br>
and the communication network to handle data traffic to and from real time<br>
simultaneously monitored wireless control systems. The location of these wireless<br>
control systems is limited only by their ability to connect to a communication network,<br>
such as the Internet.<br>
[00039] Fig. 5 is a flow chart 500 illustrating an embodiment of the method of<br>
monitoring and controlling a wireless audio source such as a wireless microphone.<br>
At step 502, a link is initiated to the central control 102. Once the link is made, the<br>
wireless microphone system 106 is linked to a computer at the central control 102 at<br>
step 504. The central control receives identification information of the wireless<br>
microphone system 106 and the corresponding monitored function list. Further<br>
operational and instrumentation data is transmitted to the central center for analysis<br>
and evaluation of the monitored functions of the wireless microphone system 106 at<br>
step 506. Each element of the monitored function list is evaluated against a<br>
corresponding stored value or status reference.<br>
[00040] In the event a defect or malfunctioning is detected, at step 508, for any<br>
element of the monitored functions list, a remedial action will be taken, at step 510,<br>
as deemed appropriate based on the recommendation of a technical support based<br>
at the central control 102 or an expert system stored in the computer at the central<br>
control 102. Such remedial may be changing parameters of the malfunctioning<br>
functions of the wireless microphone system 106, at step 510. At step 512, results to<br>
the performed remedial actions are evaluated back at the central control 102.<br>
[00041] If the defect or malfunctioning is not resolved for any of the controllable<br>
monitored functions, the wireless microphone system 106 will be sent for repair to an<br>
appropriate repair facility, at step 514. Otherwise, the technical support may choose<br>
to suspend the link, at step 516, between the wireless microphone system 106 and<br>
the central control 102, or may keep monitoring the wireless microphone system for<br>
any part of the audio transmission.<br>
[00042] Fig. 6 is a block diagram illustrating a further exemplary embodiment of<br>
the present invention. In this application, a system 600 is shown that comprises a<br>
master receiver 606 and a number of slave receivers 610 that are connected via a<br>
communication bus 608. In this exemplary communication network, the remote<br>
central control 102 is coupled via the Internet 104 to a master receiver 606. The<br>
master receiver 606 is, in turn, coupled to a number of slave receivers 610 via, for<br>
example, a communication bus 608 or any other communication structure that<br>
facilitates a master/slave communication system.<br>
[00043] In the master/slave communication system, the master receiver 606 is<br>
in total control of communications. This master receiver 606 makes a polling of data<br>
(i.e., sends and receives data, such as the plurality of monitored functions introduced<br>
above) to each slave receiver 610 in sequence as desired by the central control 102.<br>
The slave receiver 610 responds to the master receiver 606 only when it receives a<br>
request. This request can be a broadcast to all slave receivers 610, or can be<br>
unique to a specific slave receiver 610 as it includes the slave receiver"s 610 unique<br>
identification in the form of, for example, an Internet Protocol (IP) address. IP<br>
addresses are used to deliver packets of data across a communication network and<br>
have what is termed end-to-end significance. This means that the source and<br>
destination IP address remains constant as the packet traverses the communication<br>
network. Each slave receiver 610 will have its own unique IP address to allow correct<br>
identification. If a slave receiver 610 does not respond for a predetermined period of<br>
time, the master receiver 606 retries to poll it for a number of times before continuing<br>
to poll the next slave receiver 610.<br>
[00044] As discussed above, each wireless audio system 200 will have a data<br>
list that includes the plurality of controllable and non-controllable monitored<br>
functions, that corresponds to its wireless communication system. This master/slave<br>
system allows the central control 102 to include any desired corrective measures for<br>
a specific slave receiver 610, by identifying it in the data packet it communicates to<br>
the master receiver 606 by its IP address. The master receiver 606 will, in turn,<br>
communicate the desired corrective measures to the targeted slave receiver 610.<br>
[00045] Referring to Fig. 7, a specific embodiment of an exemplary transmitter<br>
system 700 that incorporates a number of aspects of the present invention is shown.<br>
Fig. 8 shows an exemplary receiver system that is used in connection with the<br>
transmitter system shown in Fig. 8.<br>
[00046] The circuitry shown in Figs. 7-8 allows transmission of various data<br>
between a transmitter and a receiver, and products incorporating such circuitry can<br>
be manufactured for minimum cost. For example, there is no additional circuitry<br>
required to compensate for the problems associated with recognition of a threshold<br>
frequency in the case of amplitude modulation. Similarly, costs associated with the<br>
provision of accurate frequency for frequency switching purposes, as well as costs<br>
associated with providing multiple oscillators, are eliminated.<br>
[00047] On the transmitter side, a function is provided that can intermit the tone<br>
signal for accurate frequency by utilization of coded serial number and a tone burst.<br>
Serial data is represented by turning the tone signal "on" or "off." As one example,<br>
the existence of the tone represents a "1" while no tone represents a "0." This is<br>
done at an accurate bit rate (serial data clock).<br>
[00048] On the receiver side, the circuitry restores continuous codes with 1 or<br>
0, and the CPU restores them to data. The circuitry also includes a hold circuit that<br>
holds the tone burst slightly longer than the maximum period so that a "no tone"<br>
occurs at a tone burst. This allows, for example, the receiver to not be muted by<br>
mistake even though the tone signal is intermitted. In one exemplary embodiment,<br>
the "hold" circuit includes a diode and a capacitor that detects the tone signal, such<br>
that the capacitor is big enough to hold the signal through any serial data chatter that<br>
may be generated by the mute circuit in connection with the representation of serial<br>
data by turning the tone signal on and off.<br>
[00049] The receiver circuitry also provides additional advantages. Normally,<br>
when a transmitter stops transmitting a wave, the tone for the tone squelch signal is<br>
stopped first, and the wave is then stopped after waiting a sufficient time to operate<br>
the mute circuit of the receiver. This can introduce unwanted noise into the<br>
transmitted signal. To avoid this, a hold circuit is utilized to add additional holding<br>
time on the stabilized time for the mute circuit of the receiver. This reduces noise<br>
addition to the transmitted signal.<br>
[00050] In the exemplary embodiment shown in Fig. 7, all of the illustrated<br>
electronics are included in a hand-held wireless microphone or a body pack.<br>
Transmitter system 700 includes an audio signal management block 702, which<br>
includes an acoustic transducer, and other related circuitry that allows an audio<br>
signal to be changed into an electrical signal. A pilot tone generator 704 generates a<br>
pilot tone at a frequency, in one exemplary embodiment of about 32kHz.<br>
[00051] A central processing unit (CPU) 706 is incorporated within the<br>
transmitter system 700. The CPU 706 provides coded and serialized information<br>
from the transmitter to the tone burst creation circuitry 708, which incorporates this<br>
information on the tone burst. The resulting signal is fed to a mixer 710 which<br>
combines the resulting signal with an audio signal. The combined signal from mixer<br>
710 is modulated at block 712 and the transmitted to ambient atmosphere via high-<br>
frequency output antenna 714.<br>
[00052] Referring to Fig. 8, a signal from the transmitter system 700 is received<br>
by antenna 716 and sent to tuner 718 and demodulator 720 for appropriate tuning<br>
and demodulation operations. A filter 722 is included to separate from the<br>
transmitted audio signal the tone burst signal. The tone burst signal is fed to a tone<br>
decoder 724, while the transmitted audio signal is sent to the mute circuit 726.<br>
[00053] The tone decoder receives the tone burst signal from the filter 722, and<br>
communicates the decoded result to CPU 728. As discussed in greater detail<br>
hereinafter, the decoded result comprises certain serial data. The tone signal is fed<br>
from the decoder 724 to a hold circuit 730, and then on to a conventional tone<br>
squelch circuit 732. The tone squelch circuit 732 and the mute circuit 726 cooperate<br>
to provide an audio output at block 734 that includes substantially reduced noise at<br>
minimum cost.<br>
[00054] Table 1 set forth below sets forth one exemplary list of the coded<br>
serialized data that may be communicated between a transmitter and a receiver of a<br>
wireless microphone or other system that incorporates aspects of the present<br>
invention:<br>
[00055] The data sets encompassed by the present invention, including that<br>
presented in Table 1, provides a number of distinct advantages. On the transmitter<br>
side, the data sets provide a function that allows a unique wording or code to be<br>
associated with that user, and allows the code to be memorized. The gain/output<br>
power of an audio amplifier, as well as a setpoint condition of audio mute, can be<br>
memorized as well. The data set also allows individual setpoints and user names to<br>
be memorized as a set. All of this data, including current information regarding the<br>
remainder of battery life, can be coded and transmitted with a tone burst signal as<br>
discussed above. On the receiver side, a receiver indicates the setpoint data, and<br>
operates by the codes received by the transmitter.<br>
[00056] In accordance with this aspect of the invention, it is possible to control<br>
a transmitter and a receiver as a set by displaying the user name on the receiver.<br>
When the setpoint condition of a transmitter is sent to a receiver with a user name, it<br>
is confirmable for a specific setup condition per each transmitter through each<br>
receiver. As a result of this, it is not needed for a person using the wireless audio<br>
system to make a written note of the user name or setpoint for each transmitter and<br>
receiver. This also reduces mistakes and enhances job performance of such<br>
personnel.<br>
[00057] Referring to Figs. 9A-9C, diagrams which illustrate an exemplary frame<br>
composition, frame leader format, and data format for 8 bit unit data with<br>
asynchronous serial transmission are shown. In the illustrated embodiment of the<br>
invention shown in Fig. 9A, each frame composition comprises a frame leader and<br>
two duplicates of the data that is to be sent from a transmitter to a receiver. Fig. 9B<br>
illustrates an eight bit frame leader format. Fig. 9C shows how the data is formatted<br>
in an exemplary embodiment of the present invention. It should be appreciated that<br>
the embodiments of the invention shown in Table 1 and Figs. 9A-9C is exemplary in<br>
nature, and is not intended to limit the scope of the present invention to the specific<br>
embodiments shown. Each system will be specifically tailored to that which is<br>
needed by the particular requirements of the user.<br>
[00058] From the foregoing it will be observed that numerous modifications and<br>
variations can be effectuated without departing from the true spirit and scope of the<br>
novel concepts of the present invention. It is to be understood that no limitation with<br>
respect to the specific embodiments illustrated is intended or should be inferred.<br>
The disclosure is intended to cover by the appended claims all such modifications as<br>
fall within the scope of the claims.<br>
