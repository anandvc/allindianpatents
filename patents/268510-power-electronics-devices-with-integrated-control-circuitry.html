CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION<br>
[0001] This application claims the benefit of United States provisional<br>
patent application serial number 60/952,778, filed July 30, 2007, which is<br>
incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0002] The present invention generally relates to power electronics<br>
devices, and more particularly relates to power electronics devices with<br>
integrated control circuitry.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0003] In recent years, advances in technology, as well as ever-evolving<br>
tastes in style, have led to substantial changes in the design of automobiles.<br>
One of the changes involves the complexity of the electrical systems within<br>
automobiles, particularly alternative fuel vehicles, such as hybrid, electric, and<br>
fuel cell vehicles. Such alternative fuel vehicles typically use one or more<br>
electric motors, perhaps in combination with another actuator, to drive the<br>
wheels. Additionally, such automobiles may also include other motors, as<br>
well as other high voltage components, to operate the other various systems<br>
within the automobile, such as the air conditioner.<br><br>
[0004] Due to the fact that alternative fuel automobiles typically include<br>
only direct current (DC) power supplies, direct current-to-alternating current<br>
(DC/AC) inverters (or power inverters) are provided to convert the DC power<br>
to alternating current (AC) power, which is generally required by the motors.<br>
Such vehicles, particularly fuel cell vehicles, also often use two separate<br>
voltage sources, such as a battery and a fuel cell, to power the electric motors<br>
that drive the wheels. Thus, power converters, such as direct current-to-direct<br>
current (DC/DC) converters, are typically also provided to manage and<br>
transfer the power from the two voltage sources.<br>
[0005] As the power demands on the electrical systems in alternative fuel<br>
vehicles continue to increase, there is an ever increasing need to maximize the<br>
efficiency and reliability of such systems. Additionally, there is a constant<br>
desire to reduce the cost and space required by the components within the<br>
electrical systems in order to minimize the overall cost and weight of the<br>
vehicles. One particular source of increased cost is the direct bonded copper<br>
substrates conventionally required of many power inverters.<br>
[0006] Therefore, it is desirable to provide a power electronics device,<br>
particularly an inverter, with attributes of low cost, high current, and compact<br>
design. Furthermore, other desirable features and characteristics of the present<br>
invention will become apparent from the subsequent detailed description and<br>
the appended claims, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings<br>
and the foregoing technical field and background.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0007] In accordance with an exemplary embodiment, a power switch<br>
apparatus includes a substrate; a semiconductor die mounted on the substrate<br>
and including power electronics circuitry for a high power, alternating current<br>
motor application; gate drive circuitry mounted on the substrate and<br><br>
electrically coupled to the power electronics circuitry on the semiconductor<br>
die; and control circuitry mounted on the substrate and electrically coupled to<br>
the gate drive circuitry.<br>
[0008] In accordance with another exemplary embodiment, an automotive<br>
drive system includes an electric motor; a direct current (DC) power supply<br>
coupled to the electric motor; a power inverter assembly coupled to the<br>
electric motor and the DC power supply to receive DC power from the DC<br>
power supply and provide alternating current (AC) power to the electric<br>
motor. The power inverter assembly includes a substrate; a semiconductor die<br>
mounted on the substrate and including power electronics circuitry for<br>
converting the DC power to AC power; gate drive circuitry mounted on the<br>
substrate and electrically coupled to the power electronics circuitry on the<br>
semiconductor die; and control circuitry mounted on the substrate and<br>
electrically coupled to the gate drive circuitry.<br>
[0009] In accordance with yet another exemplary embodiment, a power<br>
switch apparatus includes a printed circuit board (PCB) substrate with a first<br>
side and a second side; a plurality of semiconductor die mounted on the first<br>
side of the substrate, the semiconductor die including insulated gate bipolar<br>
transistors (IGBTs) for a high power, alternating current motor application;<br>
gate drive circuitry mounted on the first side of the substrate and electrically<br>
coupled to the IGBTs of the semiconductor die; control circuitry mounted on<br>
the second side of the substrate and electrically coupled to the gate drive<br>
circuitry with an interconnect formed in a via through the substrate; and an<br>
EMI shield formed in the substrate to isolate the control circuitry from the<br>
semiconductor die.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br><br>
[0010] The present invention will hereinafter be described in conjunction<br>
with the following drawing figures, wherein like numerals denote like<br>
elements, and wherein:<br>
[0011] FIG. 1 is a schematic view of an exemplary automobile according<br>
to one embodiment of the present invention; and<br>
[0012] FIG. 2 is an exemplary layout of a power switch apparatus of the<br>
inverter assembly of the automobile of FIG. 1.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF AN EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENT<br>
[0013] The following detailed description is merely exemplary in nature<br>
and is not intended to limit the invention or the application and uses of the<br>
invention. Furthermore, there is no intention to be bound by any expressed or<br>
implied theory presented in the preceding technical field, background, brief<br>
summary or the following detailed description.<br>
[0014] Broadly, exemplary embodiments described herein provide more<br>
compact and less expensive power electronics devices. More particularly,<br>
exemplary embodiments provide an inverter assembly with semiconductor die,<br>
gate drive circuitry, and control circuitry mounted on a relatively low cost<br>
substrate.<br>
[0015] The following description refers to elements or features being<br>
"connected" or "coupled" together. As used herein, "connected" may refer to<br>
one element/feature being mechanically joined to (or directly communicating<br>
with) another element/feature, and not necessarily directly. Likewise,<br>
"coupled" may refer to one element/feature being directly or indirectly joined<br>
to (or directly or indirectly communicating with) another element/feature, and<br>
not necessarily mechanically. However, it should be understood that although<br>
two elements may be described below, in one embodiment, as being<br><br>
"connected," in alternative embodiments similar elements may be "coupled,"<br>
and vice versa. Thus, although the schematic diagrams shown herein depict<br>
example arrangements of elements, additional intervening elements, devices,<br>
features, or components may be present in an actual embodiment.<br>
[0016] Further, various components and features described herein may be<br>
referred to using particular numerical descriptors, such as first, second, third,<br>
etc., as well as positional and/or angular descriptors, such horizontal and<br>
vertical. However, such descriptors may be used solely for descriptive<br>
purposes relating to drawings and should not be construed as limiting, as the<br>
various components may be rearranged in other embodiments. It should also<br>
be understood that FIGS. 1 and 2 are merely illustrative and may not be drawn<br>
to scale.<br>
[0017] FIG. 1 illustrates an automobile (or "automotive drive system") 10,<br>
according to one embodiment of the present invention. The automobile 10<br>
includes a chassis 12, a body 14, a number of wheels 16, and an electronic<br>
control system 18. The body 14 is arranged on the chassis 12 and<br>
substantially encloses the other components of the automobile 10. The body<br>
14 and the chassis 12 may jointly form a frame. The wheels 16 are each<br>
rotationally coupled to the chassis 12 near a respective corner of the body 14.<br>
[0018] The automobile 10 may be any one of a number of different types<br>
of automobiles, such as, for example, a sedan, a wagon, a truck, or a sport<br>
utility vehicle (SUV), and may be two-wheel drive (2WD) (i.e., rear-wheel<br>
drive or front-wheel drive), four-wheel drive (4WD), or all-wheel drive<br>
(AWD). The automobile 10 may also incorporate any one of, or combination<br>
of, a number of different types of engines, such as, for example, a gasoline or<br>
diesel fueled combustion engine, a "flex fuel vehicle" (FFV) engine (i.e.,<br>
using a mixture of gasoline and alcohol), a gaseous compound (e.g., hydrogen<br>
and/or natural gas) fueled engine, a combustion/electric motor hybrid engine,<br>
and an electric motor.<br><br>
[0019] In the exemplary embodiment illustrated in FIG. 1, the automobile<br>
10 is a hybrid vehicle, and further includes an actuator assembly 20, a battery<br>
(or direct current (DC) power supply) 22, a power electronics device 24, and a<br>
radiator 26. In this exemplary embodiment, the power electronic device 24 is<br>
an inverter assembly and will be referred to below as such. The actuator<br>
assembly 20 includes a combustion engine 28 and an electric motor/generator<br>
(or motor) 30. As will be appreciated by one skilled in the art, the electric<br>
motor 30 includes a transmission therein, and although not illustrated also<br>
includes a stator assembly (including conductive coils), a rotor assembly<br>
(including a ferromagnetic core), and a cooling fluid (i.e., coolant). The stator<br>
assembly and/or the rotor assembly within the electric motor 30 may include<br>
multiple electromagnetic poles (e.g., sixteen poles), as is commonly<br>
understood.<br>
[0020] Still referring to FIG. 1, in one embodiment, the combustion engine<br>
28 and the electric motor 30 are integrated such that both are mechanically<br>
coupled to at least some of the wheels 16 through one or more drive shafts 32.<br>
The radiator 26 is connected to the frame at an outer portion thereof and<br>
although not illustrated in detail, includes multiple cooling channels therein<br>
that contain a cooling fluid (i.e., coolant) such as water and/or ethylene glycol<br>
(i.e., "antifreeze") and is coupled to the engine 28 and the inverter assembly<br>
24.<br>
[0021] During operation, the vehicle 10 is operated by providing power to<br>
the wheels 16 with the combustion engine 28 and the electric motor 30 in an<br>
alternating manner and/or with the combustion engine 28 and the electric<br>
motor 30 simultaneously. In order to power the electric motor 30, DC power<br>
is provided from the battery 22 to the inverter assembly 24, which converts the<br>
DC power into AC power, before the power is sent to the electric motor 30.<br>
As will be appreciated by one skilled in the art, the conversion of DC power to<br>
AC power is substantially performed by operating (i.e., repeatedly switching)<br><br>
transistor circuitry in power switches of the inverter assembly 24, as discussed<br>
below in reference to FIG. 2.<br>
[0022] Referring to FIG. 2, an exemplary layout of a power switch<br>
apparatus 100 in the inverter assembly 24 is shown in greater detail.<br>
Generally, one or more power switch apparatus 100 form an inverter assembly<br>
24. The power switch apparatus 100 and larger inverter assembly 24 are each<br>
considered a "power electronics" device. Generally, power electronics is<br>
technology associated with the efficient conversion, control and conditioning<br>
of electric power by static means from its available input form into the desired<br>
electrical output form. Such conversion is performed with semiconductor<br>
switching devices such as diodes, thyristors and transistors, and substantial<br>
amounts of electrical energy are processed. In contrast, other electronic<br>
systems are concerned with transmission and processing of signals and data<br>
and do not process substantial amounts of energy.<br>
[0023] The power switch apparatus 100 particularly includes<br>
semiconductor die 105 mounted on a substrate 110 and enclosed in a housing<br>
120. The semiconductor die 105 may be soldered to the substrate 110,<br>
although other arrangements are also possible. The semiconductor die 105<br>
may include a semiconductor substrate (e.g., silicon substrate) with an<br>
integrated circuit formed thereon that includes one or more of the switches in<br>
the form of individual semiconductor devices, such as insulated gate bipolar<br>
transistors (IGBTs), as is commonly understood. In one embodiment,<br>
semiconductor die 100 generally includes a three-phase circuit coupled to the<br>
motor 30 and the battery 22 (FIG. 1).<br>
[0024] In one embodiment, the substrate 110 is a relatively low cost<br>
substrate, such as a PCB. The substrate can be, for example, an<br>
epoxy/fiberglass material, although other material can be used. Standard PCB<br>
techniques can be used to mount and interconnect the various components on<br>
the substrate 110. Generally, the power switch apparatus 100 does not require<br><br>
a direct, or double, bonded copper (DBC) substrate or other type of substrate<br>
with high thermal conductivity. Although a single substrate 110 is shown with<br>
two semiconductor die 105, additional or few semiconductor die can be<br>
provided, as well as additional substrates that form, for example, a switch<br>
module.<br>
[0025] Gate drive circuitry 130 is formed on the substrate 110. Generally,<br>
the gate drive circuitry 130 converts logic level control signals into the<br>
appropriate voltage and current for efficient, reliable switching of the power<br>
switch apparatus 100, particularly the circuitry that forms the IGBTs on the<br>
semiconductor die 105. In conventional power switches, gate drive circuitry is<br>
provided on a separate substrate.<br>
[0026] The power switch apparatus 100 also includes a number of wire<br>
bonds 140 that interconnect the semiconductor die 105 to various conductive<br>
members (e.g., bus bars) formed in or on the substrate 110 such that the<br>
semiconductor die 105 is electrically coupled to the gate drive circuitry 130,<br>
and the gate drive circuitry 130 can be coupled to components outside of the<br>
power switch apparatus 100.<br>
[0027] Exemplary embodiments provide a power switch apparatus 100<br>
with integrated gate drive circuitry 130 that requires fewer interconnects than<br>
conventional assemblies. For example, a separate gate drive board is not<br>
necessary.<br>
[0028] In one exemplary embodiment, control circuitry 150 can<br>
additionally be mounted on the substrate 110. The control circuitry 150 can<br>
include or be coupled to various sensors and automotive control modules, or<br>
electronic control units (ECUs), such as an inverter control module and a<br>
vehicle controller, and at least one processor and/or a memory which includes<br>
instructions stored thereon (or in another computer-readable medium) for<br>
carrying out the processes of the inverter assembly 24. Generally, the control<br>
circuitry 150 produces a Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) signal for<br><br>
controlling the switching action of the circuitry on the semiconductor die 105,<br>
which then converts the PWM signal to a modulated voltage waveform for<br>
operating the motor 30 (FIG. 1).<br>
[0029] In the exemplary depicted embodiment, the control circuitry 150 is<br>
mounted on an opposite side of the substrate 110 relative to the semiconductor<br>
die 105 and gate drive circuitry 130, although in other embodiments, the<br>
control circuitry 150 can be mounted on the same side of the substrate 110 as<br>
the semiconductor die 105 and gate drive circuitry 130. Mounting the control<br>
circuitry 150 on an opposite side relative to the semiconductor die 105 and<br>
gate drive circuitry 130 provides isolation, particularly with an EMI shield 160<br>
formed within the substrate 110. This isolation enables the relatively high<br>
voltage circuitry on the semiconductor die 105 and the relatively low voltage<br>
components of the control circuitry 150 to operate without interference. The<br>
EMI shield 160 can be, for example, a layer of grounded, conductive material<br>
within the substrate 110. In conventional power switches, gate drive circuitry<br>
is provided on a separate substrate.<br>
[0030] The control circuitry 150 can be coupled to the gate drive circuitry<br>
130 through the substrate 110 with, for example, interconnects 170 in vias<br>
175. The vias 175 can be formed, for example, by laser drilling or punching,<br>
and in one embodiment, filled by thick film techniques. Thick film is a<br>
technique of filling the vias 175 with a slurry or paste of one or more of un-<br>
fired ceramic materials and metal powders, usually gold, and then firing the<br>
slurry or paste to create the interconnects 170.<br>
[0031] Exemplary embodiments provide a power switch apparatus 100 of<br>
an inverter assembly 24 with integrated control circuitry 150 that requires<br>
fewer interconnects than conventional assemblies. For example, a separate<br>
control board is not necessary. This enables additional flexibility and<br>
creativity in the electrical design.<br><br>
[0032] As noted above, the power switch apparatus 100 also includes the<br>
housing 120 that encloses the semiconductor die 105, substrate 110, and<br>
associated circuitry. The housing 34 may be made of a molded plastic<br>
material or any other suitable material.<br>
[0033] During operation, the semiconductor die 105 generates heat. In<br>
one embodiment, the semiconductor die 105 generates a heat flux density of at<br>
least 10 W/cm2, while in another embodiment, generates a heat flux density of<br>
at least 20 W/cm2. In order to remove heat from the semiconductor die 105,<br>
the fluid within the radiator 26 is circulated by the pump 32 (FIG. 1) to one or<br>
more nozzles 180 within the power switch apparatus 100. The fluid is sprayed<br>
through the nozzles 180 onto the semiconductor die 105. Heat from the<br>
semiconductor die 105 conducts to the fluid before the fluid runs off. The<br>
fluid may then be collected and returned to the radiator 26, by the pump 32, to<br>
be cooled within the cooling channels of the radiator 26 (FIG. 1). The coolant<br>
fluid is preferably a dielectric liquid. As will be apparent to one skilled in the<br>
art, the particular dielectric liquid selected will depend upon device chemistry<br>
and application. Suitable dielectric liquids may include, but are not limited to,<br>
fluorocarbons, silicone oils, and polyalphaolephins. In this exemplary<br>
embodiment, the power switch apparatus 100 and/or inverter assembly 24<br>
does not include a heat sink. Other examples of heat removal include<br>
atomizers and other cooling mechanisms.<br>
[0034] While at least one exemplary embodiment has been presented in<br>
the foregoing detailed description, it should be appreciated that a vast number<br>
of variations exist. It should also be appreciated that the exemplary<br>
embodiment or exemplary embodiments are only examples, and are not<br>
intended to limit the scope, applicability, or configuration of the invention in<br>
any way. Rather, the foregoing detailed description will provide those skilled<br>
in the art with a convenient road map for implementing the exemplary<br>
embodiment or exemplary embodiments. It should be understood that various<br>
changes can be made in the function and arrangement of elements without<br><br>
departing from the scope of the invention as set forth in the appended claims<br>
and the legal equivalents thereof.<br><br>
