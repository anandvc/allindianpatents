Coating * and ‘‘ binding agent for pharmaceutical formulations having improved storage stability<br>
The invention relates to a coating and binding agent for pharmaceutical formulations having improved storage stability.<br>
Prior art<br>
WO 00/05307 describes a process for the production of a coating and binding agent for oral or dermal pharmaceuticals consisting of (a) 35 - 98% by weight of a copolymer consisting of free-’radical-polymerized Cl-to C4-esters of acrylic or methacrylic acid and further (meth)acrylate monomers which have functional tertiary ammonium groups and (b) 1 - 50% by weight of a plasticizer and 1 - 15% by weight of an emulsifier having an HLB of at least 14, the components (a) , (b) and (c) being blended with one another with or without addition of water and optionally with addition of a pharmaceutical active compound and further customary additives and the coating and binding agent being produced by melting, casting, spreading or spraying, the copolymer (a) being incorporated in powder form having an average particle size of 1-40 |im.<br>
The formulation in the defined powder form in combination with plasticizer and emulsifier makes it possible to convert the corresponding copolymers into stable aqueous solutions or dispersions without the addition of acids. There is the advantage that an otherwise occurring bitter intrinsic taste of the coating agent can be avoided. The coating and binding agents are moreover hardly soluble in water, but dissolve rapidly in artificial gastric juice. They are therefore particularly suitable for taste-isolating formulations which rapidly decompose in the gastric juice. No details are contained on the water permeability of the coatings.<br><br>
Object and achievement<br>
While a whole series of pharmaceutical active compounds are very stable in dry air, they are sensitive to moisture and moisture-related pH shifts in the alkaline pH range. The storage conditions for coated or bound pharmaceutical formulations are not optimum everywhere, so that, for example, in tropical regions it can perfectly well occur that such pharmaceutical formulations are exposed to relatively high atmospheric humidifies over a relatively long period before use. It is therefore generally important that as little moisture as possible can penetrate through the pharmaceutical coatings or binding agents to the enclosed active compound* It was therefore seen as an object to make available coating and binding agents for oral or dermal pharmaceutical forms which guarantee a good isolation against the penetration of atmospheric humidity.<br>
The invention starts essentially from WO 00/05307, The coating and binding agents described there are in particular to be further developed to the effect that their water vapour permeability is improved without the other properties such as rapid disintegration in artificial gastric juice and good processability being adversely affected.<br>
The object is achieved by a<br>
process for the production of a coating and binding agent for oral or dermal pharmaceutical forms consisting essentially of<br>
(a) a copolymer consisting of free-radical-polymerized CI- to C4-esters of acrylic or methacrylic acid and further (meth)acrylate monomers which have functional tertiary ammonium groups, the copolymer being present<br><br>
in powder form having an average particle size of 1 -40 |im<br>
(b)	3 to 15% by weight/ based on (a), of an emulsifier having an HLB of at least 14<br>
(c)	5 to 50% by weight, based on (a) , of a C12- to  -aminocarboxylic acid or a C12- to  hydroxyl compound<br>
the components (a) , (b) and (c) being blended or mixed with one another with or without addition of water and optionally with addition of a pharmaceutical active compound and further customary additives and the coating and binding agent being produced from the mixture by melting, casting, spreading, spraying or granulating.<br>
While coating and binding agents according to WO 00/05307 have water vapour permeability’s measured according to DIN 53 122 in the range of 400 (g/m’/d) or above, the coating and binding agents according to the invention lie at water vapour permeability’s of at most 350 (g/mVd) , preferably at most 300 (g/mVd) , particularly preferably at most 200 (g/m’/d) * It was not foreseeable that it would be possible to achieve this effect by the combination of the components (a), (b) to [sic] (c) without the known advantageous properties of coating and binding agents according to WO 00/05307 being adversely affected. In particular, the use of the component (c) also makes possible extensive or complete relinquishment of customary plasticizers. This is a further advantage, as efforts are always made to keep the number of the components in pharmaceutical formulations low.<br>
Carrying out the invention<br>
Component (a)<br><br>
The copolymers (a) consist essentially or entirely of free-radical-polymerized CI to C4 esters of acrylic or methacrylic acid and further (meth)acrylate monomers which contain functional tertiary ammonium groups.<br>
Suitable monomers having functional tertiary ammonium groups are listed in US 4 705 695, column 3, line 64 to column 4, line 13. Particular mention may be made of dimethylaminoethy1 acrylate, 2-dimethylaminopropyl acrylate, dimethylaminopropyl methacrylate, dimethyl-amino benzyl acrylate, dimethylaminobenzyl methacrylate,<br>
(3™dimethylamino-2,2-dimethly)propyl	acrylate,<br>
dimethylamino-2,2-dimethly)propyl	methacrylate,<br>
(3-diethylamino-2,2-dimethly)propyl acrylate and<br>
diethylamino-"2, 2-dimethly) propyl	methacrylate •<br>
Dimethylaminoethy1 methacrylate is particularly preferred.<br>
The content of the monomers having tertiary ammonium groups in the copolymer can advantageously be between 30 and 70% by weight, preferably between 40 and 60% by weight. The proportions of the CI to C4 esters of acrylic or methacrylic acid is 70 - 30% by weight. Mention may be made of methyl methacrylate, ethyl methacrylate, butyl methacrylate, methyl acrylate, ethyl acrylate, butyl acrylate.<br>
A (meth)acrylate copolymer having tertiary amino groups corresponding to component (a) can be synthesized, for example, from 20 - 30% by weight of methyl methacrylate, 20 - 30% by weight of butyl methacrylate and 60 - 4 0% by weight of dime thy aminomethyl methacrylate. The proportion of component (a) in the formulation is preferably 50 - 90% by weight.<br>
The copolymers (a) are obtained in a manner known per se by free-radical substance, solution, bead or emulsion polymerization. They must be brought into the particle size range according to the invention before<br><br>
processing by means of suitable grinding, drying or spraying processes. Suitable equipment for the production of the powders is familiar to the person skilled in the art, e.g. air-jet mills, pinned disc mills, fan mills. If desired, appropriate screening steps can be included. A suitable mill for large industrial amounts is, for example, a counter-jet mill (Multi No. 42Q0) which is operated at about 6 bar overpressure,<br>
The average particle size of the powders can be determined as follows:<br>
By means of air-jet screening for the simple division of the ground product into a few fractions-This method is somewhat more inaccurate in this measuring range than the alternatives. At least 70, preferably 90, % of the particles based on the mass (mass distribution) , however, should be in the size range according to the invention of 1 - 40 ‘m, preferably 10 -  30  <br>
A highly suitable measuring method is laser scattering for determination of the particle size distribution. Commercial apparatuses allow measurement in air (Malvern S3-01 particle size) or preferably in liquid media (LOT, Galai CIS 1). The prerequisite for measurement in liquids is the polymer does not dissolve therein or the particles change in another manner during the measurement. A suitable medium is, for example, a highly diluted (about 0.02% strength) aqueous polysorbate 80 solution. The average particle diameter must be in the range between 1 to 40, preferably between 5 and 35, in particular between 10 and 20 |im.<br>
Component (b)<br>
Emulsifiers or surfactants are surface-active substances having lyobipolar character, i.e. non-polar, lipophilic  and polar,  hydrophilic  centres  must  be<br><br>
present in their molecule (P*H. List, Arzneiformen-lehre, Wissenschaftliche Verlagsgesellschaft mbH Stuttgart/ 1982, Chap, 6.2.)- Depending on the molecular structure, a differentiation is made between ionic and non-ionic emulsifiers.<br>
The HLB is a measure of the hydrophilicity or lipophilicity of non-ionic surfactants introduced in 1950 by Griffin. It can be determined experimentally by means of the phenol titration method according to Marszall; cf. ""'Parfumerie, Kosmetik" (Perfumery, Cosmetics), Volume 60, 1979, pp. 444 - 448; further references in Rompp, Chemie-Lexikon, 8’’ Edition 1983/ p. 17 50. Furthermore see, for example, US 4 795 643 (Seth)) .<br>
An HLB (Hydrophilic/Lipophilic Balance) can only be determined exactly in the case of non-ionic emulsifiers. In the case of anionic emulsifiers, this value can be determined arithmetically, but is virtually always above or far above 14.<br>
Emulsifiers (b) having an HLB of below 14 are understood according to the invention as meaning hydrophilic, non-ionic emulsifiers having an HLB range of at least 14, and likewise hydrophilic, anionic emulsifiers and their salts which have an arithmetic HLB of over 14, Emulsifiers having HLBs of less than 14, such as, for example, glycerol monostearate, can indeed additionally also be contained, but do not replace the emulsifiers (b) having HLBs of at least 14. Suitable emulsifiers (b) are, for example, sodium laurylsulphate and sodium cetylstearylsulphate, sucrose stearate and polysorbate 80. The emulsifiers (b) are present in amounts of 1 - 15, preferably 5-10, % by weight, based on component (a). Also possible, of course, is the use of emulsifier mixtures.<br><br>
The addition of the emulsifiers (b) to the formulation can be carried out in a known manner, directly, in aqueous solution or after thermal pretreatment of the mixture.<br>
Depending on type (lipophilic or hydrophilic) and amount added, the emulsifiers can influence the functionality of the polymer layer.<br>
Component (c)<br>
Component (c) : 5 to 50, preferably 10 to 20, % by weight (based on the component (a) ) of a C12- to Cie-monocarboxylic acid or of a C12- to  -hydroxyl compound. The component (c) is crucial for the surprisingly low water vapour permeability of the formulations.<br>
Unbranched C12- to Cie-monocarboxylic acid or of a C12-to  -hydroxyl compounds [sic] are preferred. Optionally, branched derivatives of the substances mentioned can also be suitable.<br>
C12- to Ci8-monocarboxylic acids are, for example, in particular, lauric acid and myristic acid. Palmitic acid and stearic acid are preferred,<br>
Ci2" to Ci8-hydroxyl compound, in particular alkanols having a terminal hydroxy1 group such as, for example, lauryl alcohol or stearyl alcohol.<br>
Further additives<br>
As a rule, during processing to give coating and binding agents customary additives are added to the formulation according to the invention.<br>
The amounts employed and use of the customary additives in pharmaceutical films or coatings are familiar to the person skilled in the art- Customary additives can be,<br><br>
for example, release agents, pigments, stabilizers, antioxidants, pore formers, penetration promoters, luster agents, aromatic substances or flavorings. They serve as processing aids and are intended to guarantee a safe and reproducible preparation process and good long-term storage stability or they achieve additional advantageous properties in the pharmaceutical form. They are added to the polymer preparations before processing and can influence the permeability of the coatings, which can optionally be utilized as an additional control parameter.<br>
•	Release agents:<br>
Release agents as a rule have lipophilic properties and are added as a rule to the spray suspensions. They prevent agglomeration of the cores during film-coating. Preferably, talc, Mg or Ca stearate, ground silica acid, kaolin or non-ionic emulsifiers having an HLB of between 3 and 8 are employed. Customary use amounts for release agents in the coating and binding agents according to the invention are between 0.5 to 100% by weight based on the copolymer (a).<br>
In a particularly advantageous embodiment, the addition of the release agent takes place as a non-film-coating final layer. The application takes place as a powder (in concentrated form, 90 - 100% strength) or from aqueous suspension containing 5 - 30% solids content by spraying. The amount necessary is lower than in the case of incorporation into the polymer layer and is 0.1 - 2% based on the weight of the pharmaceutical form.<br>
•	Pigments:<br>
The addition only rarely takes place in the form of the soluble dye. As a rule, aluminium or iron oxide pigments are dispersed. Titanium dioxide serves as a white pigment - Customary use amounts for pigments in<br><br>
the coating and binding agents according to the invention [lacuna] between 20 and 60% by weight, based on the polymer mixture. Because of the high pigment binding power, however, amounts of up to 100% by weight can also be processed.<br>
In a particularly advantageous embodiment, use of the pigment takes place as a non-film-coating final layer. The application takes place as a powder (in concentrated form, 90 - 100% strength) or from aqueous suspension containing 5 - 30% solids content by spraying. The amount necessary is lower than in the case of incorporation into the polymer layer and is 0.1 - 2% based on the weight of the pharmaceutical form.<br>
In principle, of course, all substances employed must be toxicologically acceptable and be used in pharmaceuticals without risk for patients.<br>
Further additives can also be plasticizers. Customary amounts are between 0 and 50, preferably 0 to 20, in particular 0 to 10, % by weight. Particularly preferably, however, at most 5% by weight of or no plasticizers are present, as the formulations are often already elastic enough due to the presence of the components (c) [sic] and additional plasticizers can lead to undesired stickiness.<br>
Depending on type (lipophilic or hydrophilic) and amount added, plasticizers can influence the functionality of the polymer layer. Plasticizers achieve a lowering of the glass transition temperature by means of physical interaction with the polymer and, depending on the amount added, promote film-coating. Suitable substances as a rule have a molecular weight of between 100 and 20,000 and contain one or more hydrophilic groups in the molecule, e.g. hydroxyl, ester or amino groups.<br><br>
Examples of suitable plasticizers are alkyl citrates, glycerol esters, alkyl phthalates, alkyl sebacates, sucrose esters, sorbitan esters, diethyl sebacate, dibutyl sebacate and polyethylene glycols 200 to 12,000. Preferred plasticizers are triethyl citrate (TEC), acetyltriethyl citrate (ATEC), and dibutyl sebacate (DBS) . Mention may furthermore be made of esters which as a rule are liquid at room temperature, such as citrates, phthalates, sebacates or castor oil. Esters of citric acid and sebacic acid are preferably used.<br>
The addition of the plasticizer to the formulation can be performed in a known manner, directly, in aqueous solution or after thermal pretreatment of the mixture. Mixtures of plasticizers can also be employed.<br>
The production process<br>
The components (a) , (b) and (c) are blended with one another at ambient or elevated temperature with or without addition of water and if desired of a pharmaceutical active compound and the further customary additives and the coating and binding agent is prepared by melting, casting, spreading, spraying or granulating. The film-coating of the coating and binding agent here is a prerequisite for the functional effect in pharmaceutical forms.<br>
The film-coating is carried out, independently of the application process, by supply of energy. This can take place via convection (heat), radiation (infrared or microwaves) or conduction. Water employed for application as a suspending agent evaporates here, and if desired a vacuum can also be used in order to accelerate the evaporation. The temperature necessary for the film-coating depends on the combination of the components employed.<br><br>
Use of the formulation according to the invention for the production of binding agents:<br>
The use as binding agents is carried out’ for example, by spraying the aqueous polymer suspension onto active-compound- free cores (nonpareilles) with simultaneous addition of powdered active compounds or mixtures thereof, A further embodiment is the spraying on of the aqueous polymer suspension together with active compounds dissolved or suspended therein *<br>
Use of the formulation according to the invention for the production of coating agents:<br>
Preformed carriers for the coatings are capsules, tablets, granules, pellets, crystals of regular or irregular shape. The size of granules, pellets or crystals is between 0.01 and 2.5 mm, that of tablets between 2,5 and 30,0 mm. Capsules consist of gelatine, starch or cellulose derivatives.<br>
As a rule, powders and crystals contain 100% of the biologically active substance. Preformed carriers contain from about 0.1 to 99% of the biologically active substance or of the pharmaceutical active compound and to [sic] 1 to 99.9% by weight of further pharmaceutical excipients.<br>
Customary preparation processes are direct compression, compression of dry, moist or sintered granules, extrusion and subsequent rounding, moist or dry granulation or direct pelletting (e.g. on plates) or by binding of powders (powder layering) to active--compound-free spheres (nonpareilles) or active-compound-containing particles.<br>
In addition to the active compound, they can contain further pharmaceutical excipients: binding agents, such as cellulose and its derivatives, polyvinylpyrrolidone<br><br>
(PVP), moisturizing agents,  disintegration promoters, lubricants, disintegrants,  (meth)acrylates, starch and its derivatives, sugar solubilizer or others.<br>
Of particular importance is the disintegration time of the cores, which influences the release of the active compound. Today, short disintegration times of below 5, or below 10 min, are demanded in the disintegration test according to Ph. Eur. Longer disintegration times are therefore problematical, because additional coatings further delay the release of the active compound and can call the therapeutic effect into question. The threshold value today is regarded as a disintegration time of 30 min. Testing is carried out in water and artificial gastric juice (0,1 N HCl)-The cores employed are homogeneous or have a layered structure. If engravings are embedded in the surfaces, as far as these should be covered possible by coatings but only slightly filled in. The layer thickness employed according to the invention of the polymer powder varies greatly and depends on the processing procedure or the amount of additives. It is between 1 and 100 \xn\, preferably between 10 and 50 jam. On customary tablets, this corresponds to a polymer application of 0.5 to 5% by weight.<br>
Coated microparticles can be compressed according to K. Lehmann et al., Drugs made in Germany 37, 2, 53-60 (1994) and T.E. Becker et al., International Journal of Pharmaceutics 143, (1996) , 13-23 to give disintegrating tablets without significant influence on the function of the polymer.<br>
The function of the film-coated polymer layer in the final pharmaceutical form can be varied:<br>
•	Protection    against    harmful    environmental influences due to moisture, gases, light etc.<br>
•	Odour or taste isolation<br><br>
Marking by means of colour<br>
Mechanical stabilization<br>
Isolation of incompatible ingredients<br>
Avoidance of adhesion to the mucous membranes<br>
Temporally delayed release of active compound<br>
pH-controlled release of active compound<br>
Isolation of cores from further coatings<br>
The low viscosity of the polymer mixture in aqueous dispersion is advantageous even at high solid contents of up to 30%, as engravings on the surface of tablets are reproduced in detail.<br>
Particularly advantageous is the good protective and isolating action of the polymer mixture according to the invention with simultaneously low influence on the tablet disintegration. Even with low polymer applications of 1% by weight, a taste isolation of more than 30 sec is already achieved. Thicker coatings with a copolymer of methyl methacrylate, butyl methacrylate and dimethylaminoethy1 methacrylate in the ratio 25 : 25 : 50 (EUDRAGIT’EPO) improve the taste concealment, but without prolonging the disintegration time in 0,1 N HCl. Likewise advantageous is the permissible covering of coloured cores by coatings with a high pigment content. One particular embodiment is the embedding of a second active compound in the coating on an active-compound’ containing core.<br>
Application to the formulation according to the invention for production on carriers<br>
The formulation according to the invention can be applied by granulating, pouring, spreading or by means of spray application in powder form, as a melt or in aqueous suspension. Water is here used mainly as a vehicle in order to apply thin coatings uniformly on spherical cores, e.g. by spraying. For coatings, spreading processes are moreover employed. The process employed depends mainly on the carrier chosen.  Dry<br><br>
powders are applied by spreading or dusting, if appropriate also using electrostatic forces. The film-coating can take place by the action of heat. For implementation it is crucial here that uniform, closed layers are formed.<br>

EXAMPLES<br>
Examples 1 to 14:<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
Water vapour permeabilities, film properties<br>
Films of the dispersions prepared are drawn on condenser paper by means of a 250 [xm doctor blade and allowed to dry overnight at RT. The dried films having a layer thickness of 30-35 jam (condenser paper additionally included) are then investigated for water vapour permeability according to DIN 53122 at 23*’0, 85% relative humidity. For each dispersion, 6 tests are carried out in parallel.<br>
Description of the test:<br>
3 g of silica gel, granulation 1-3 mm/Merck, having a moisture indicator, are weighed into a plane-ground test cell made of glass (internal diameter 2 cm) and dried at llC’C for 3 hours. The ground surface of the test cell is greased with silicone paste so that after application of the film an airtight closure is guaranteed. The selected films [lacuna] applied and covered with a likewise plane-ground silicone-greased glass ring. By means of this film surface of 3.14 cm’ which is now formed, the water vapour permeability (WVP) at 23°C and 85% rel. humidity is determined gravimetrically over a period of time of 16 and 24 hours.<br>
WVD (g/mVd) = 24/t x A m/A x 24<br>
t = experimental time in hours between the weighings from which the weight difference Am is determined, i.e. 18 " 2 = 16 or 24 - 2 = 22<br>
Am - amount of water diffused through the film in g after 16 hours and 22 hours; the weight of the test cell + film obtained after 2 hours counts as a reference value.<br>
A = test area of the film in cm’ = 3.14 cm’<br><br>
The average value is calculated from the results (16 and 22 h) of at least 5 test cells.<br>
Coatings from the dispersions of the above examples<br>
The spray experiments were carried out in an Eureka coating pan with 2.5 to 3 kg batch size placebo tablets, partly replaced by quinoIine sulphate tablets or silica gel tablets. The polymer application is 2 to 4 mg/cm’.<br>
The release agent is manly homogenized in the dispersion by means of an Ultra Durra for about 15 min and then sprayed onto the rotating tablets using a two-channel spray pistol Walter NBA nozzle 1.2 mm, spray pressure of 0.8 to 1 bar. The material temperature can be between 27 to [sic] 34*’0, while the spray velocity can be 2.2 to 3 g/min/kg. Drying is then carried out in a 40°C recirculating drying oven for 4 h.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
