				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
LEG SHIELD STRUCTURE FOR MOTORCYCLE FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a structure of a leg shield which is attached to the opposite sides of a front portion of a body frame of a motorcycle to cover the legs of the passenger seated on a seat. BACKGROUND ART<br>
Conventionally, in a motorcycle of the scooter type or the like, in order to prevent the legs of the passenger from being exposed directly to the rain or wind during running, a leg shield for covering a leg of the passenger is attached to the opposite sides of a front portion of a body frame (refer to Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 10-16851).<br>
By the way, while a conventional leg shield is formed from a plate member such as a synthetic resin plate or a metal plate, the leg shield itself is designed inevitably in a complicated configuration from such a demand in regard to a function as that it should have an anticipated strength or should be attached precisely to an attachment portion of a body frame. Therefore, the leg shield is rather restricted in terms of the configuration in regard to the appearance,  and it  is  the actual<br><br>
conditions that sufficient attention is not paid to the appearance configuration having a good appearance in design. Thus, there is a problem in that it is difficult to design the leg shield in a desired configuration in appearance. Further, since the leg shield has a complicated configuration, coating painting therefor is difficult, and this tendency is particularly significant with the rear face of the leg shield opposing to the passenger (the rear face of the conventional leg shield specified as above is complicated deeply in a V-shape). Thus, the conventional leg shield has another problem in that the complicated configuration increases the cost and also makes a cause of deterioration of the quality.<br>
Further, a motorcycle of the type described is sometimes used with leg shields removed in some region or in some season. In this instance, the left shield has a further problem in that, in the conventional motorcycle, attachment and removal of the leg shield to and from the body are cumbersome and, when the leg shield is removed, a gap appears in the body of the motorcycle and the inside of the motorcycle can be observed through the gap, resulting in deterioration of the appearance. DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
Therefore, it is a principal object of the present invention to provide a novel leg shield structure for a<br><br>
motorcycle which can assure a high rigidity without using a complicated configuration for the leg shield and can form the leg shield readily in a desired configuration in appearance, particularly in a three-dimensional configuration to raise a design effect as a whole and besides facilitates coating painting and further facilitates removal of the leg shield while preventing deterioration of the appearance when the leg shield is removed.<br>
In order to attain the object described above, according to a first characteristic of the present invention, a leg shield structure for a motorcycle attached to the opposite sides of a front portion of a body frame for covering the legs of a passenger who is seated on a seat is configured such that a leg shield including a leg shield- body having at least a front wall portion extending obliquely in a direction such that the,leg shield is spaced away from the body frame from the front toward the rear of the body frame and a rear wall portion extending from a rear portion of the front wall portion in such a manner as to be bent to the inner side and then extend in an opposing relationship to each leg of the passenger toward the body frame and being formed in a hollow state is removably attached to a main pipe side cover which covers a side of a main  pipe  of  the  body  frame.    According  to  the<br><br>
characteristic, the leg shield can have an Intended rigidity and can realize a stereoscopic configuration to raise the appearance significantly without particularly fcanning the leg shield In a complicated configuration. Besides, painting coating Is facilitated, and this can contribute to reduction of the cost.<br>
According to a second characteristic of the present Invention, the rear wall portion of the leg shield body which opposes to the passenger Is formed so as to have a configuration of a concave face as viewed from the passenger side. According to the characteristic, even If the leg shield Is formed three-dlmenslonally. It can assure free movement of the leg of the passenger, and provision of a light feeling on the appearance can be realized.<br>
In order to attain the object described above, according to a third characteristic of the present Invention, the leg shield Is composed of the leg shield body and an Inner shield formed as a separate member from the leg shield body and removably fixed to an open Inner side face of the leg shield body. According to the characteristic, fabrication of the leg shield Is facilitated.<br>
In order to attain the object described above, according to a fourth characteristic of the present Invention, the leg shield Is sub-assembled first, and then<br><br>
the inner side of the leg shield which opposes to the side face of the main pipe is removably attached to the main pipe side cover. According to the characteristic, attachment of the leg shield to the body frame is ' facilitated. In addition, since the attachment portion cannot be observed readily from the outside, the appearance can be further augmented.<br>
In order to attain the object described above, according to a fifth characteristic of the present invention, an upper portion of the leg shield is removably attached to an upper portion of the main pipe side cover, and an upper edge portion of the leg shield contacts with and is supported by an end edge portion of a front top cover. According to the characteristic, a gap does not appear between the upper edge portion of the leg shield and the front top cover, and a good appearance is achieved.<br>
In order to attain the object described above, according to a sixth characteristic of the present invention, the opposite left and right sides of a front top cover are inserted in and supported by the main pipe side cover and a front face of the front top cover is attached to an attachment stay of a basket secured to a head pipe • According to the characteristic, the position of the front top cover can be restricted so as not to move in the widthwise direction only by inserting it into the left and<br><br>
right main pipe side covers.  Further, since the front top cover can be supported by the attachment stay of the basket, the supporting structure therefor can be simplified and the attaching operation Is facilitated.<br>
In order to attain the object described above, according to a seventh characteristic of the present Invention, Inner faces of the opposite sides of the front top cover have rib pieces provided Integrally In a projecting manner thereon such that the rib pieces overlap with front edge portions of the main pipe side cover so that, even In a state wherein the leg shield Is removed, the Inside cannot be observed through a gap between the front top cover and the main pipe side cover. According to the characteristic, even where the motorcycle Is used with the leg shield removed, a good appearance Is maintained. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>

Now, a structure of a leg shield Ls which is a characteristic of the present invention and an attaching structure of the leg shield Ls to the body frame F are described with reference to FIGS. 1 to 4, 9A to 9C, llA and IIB.<br>
A pair of left and right leg shields Ls are movably attached symmetrically to the left and right of a front<br><br>
portion of the body frame F each with a main pipe side cover 22 interposed therebetween. The left and right main pipe side covers 22 (hereinafter described in detail) extend along the forward and backward direction such that they cover the opposite sides of the front portion of the body frame F, and upper and lower portions of the rear side of them are secured to brackets 30 provided integrally in a projecting manner on the body frame F by means of connection bolts 31 (refer to FIG. 3).<br>
Since the pair of left and right leg shields Ls have a same structure, the structure of one of them, that is, the left side leg shield Ls, is described in detail with reference to FIGS. 1 to 4 and 6 to IIB. The leg shield Ls is made of a hard synthetic resin and is formed as a hollow member of a triangular transverse section elongated in the upward and downward direction from a leg shield body 20 and an inner shield 21 secured integrally to the leg shield body 20. The leg shield body 20 which forms a major portion of the leg shield Ls is formed from a front wall portion 20a extending obliquely in a direction such that it is spaced away from the body frame F from the front to the rear of the body frcime F, and a rear wall portion 20b which is bent inwardly at an angle of approximately 45' toward the body frame F from a rear portion of the front wall portion 20a and then extends in an opposing relationship to<br><br>
the leg Le of the passenger. The leg shield body 20 has such a transverse sectional shape of a V-shape that the end side thereof is directed to the outside of the body frame F while the open side thereof is directed to the body frame F (refer to FIG. 3) . And, the leg shield body 20 has a gradually tapering configuration from an upper portion to a lower portion and recedes rearwardly with respect to the body frame F. Further, a plurality of first attachment bosses 20c are provided in a projecting manner in a spaced relationship from each other in the upward and downward direction on an inner face of the leg shield body 20 in the proximity of the rear wall portion 20b. The attachment bosses 20c are elongated long in a transverse direction toward the body frame F, and end portions of them are secured to a main pipe side cover 22, which is hereinafter described, by means of screws b (refer to FIGS. 3 and 4) . Further, also on an inner face of the leg shield body 20 in the proximity of a front end of the front wall portion 20a, a plurality of second attachment bosses 20d are provided in a projecting manner in a spaced relationship from each other in the upward and downward direction. The second attachment bosses 20d are elongated (shorter than the first bosses 20c described above) in a transverse direction toward the body frame F, and end portions of the second attachment bosses 20d are secured to an inner shield 21<br><br>
(which forms part of the leg shield Ls), which is hereinafter described, by means of screws b (refer to FIGS. 3 and 4) • Further, as shown in FIG. 3, the front wall portion 20a of the leg shield body 20 is formed in smooth convex face configuration which is convex toward the outside, and an inner face of the rear wall portion 20b opposing to the leg Le of the passenger is formed in a concave face configuration which is concave toward the front so that free movement of the leg Le of the passenger can be guaranteed. Furthermore, a free end edge of the rear wall portion 20b is opposed to an outer face of the main pipe side cover 22 with a small gap left therebetween. The inner shield 21 removably secured to the leg shield body 20 described above and forming part of the leg shield Ls is made of hard synthetic resin Scime as that of the leg shield Ls and is formed as a plate elongated in the upward and downward direction such that it covers an open front half portion of the leg shield body 20 described above as shown in FIGS. 3, 6 and llA, IIB. And, the inner shield 21 has a plurality of front attachment holes 21a provided in a spaced relationship from each other in the upward and downward direction in a row on a front edge portion thereof, and has a plurality of rear attachment holes 21b provided in a spaced relationship from each other in the upward and downward direction in a row on a rear<br><br>
edge portion thereof- And, the inner shield 21 is secured to the front half portion of the open inner side face of the leg shield body 20 by fastening the front attachment holes 21a to the second attachment bosses 20d described above by means of the screws b. Further, a rear edge portion of the inner shield 21 is removably secured at the rear attachment holes 21b thereof to a main pipe side cover 22, which is hereinafter described, by means of screws b.<br>
The leg shield Ls sub-assembled with the inner shield 21 secured to the leg shield body 20 in such a manner as described above is removably attached to the main pipe 2 of the body freune F with the main pipe side cover 22 interposed therebetween. And, the leg shield Ls is formed three-dimensionally as described above and can assure an intended rigidity and exhibit a stereoscopic configuration to raise the appearance and achieve augmentation of the quality without particularly forming it in a complicated configuration.<br>
Further, the motorcycle is not only used with the leg shield Ls attached to the body frame but also can be used with the leg shield Ls removed.<br>
As shown in FIGS. 2, 3 and lOA, lOB, the main pipe side cover 22 described above extends in the forward and backward direction sidewardly of the body frame F such that it covers the side of the main pipe 2 of the body frame F.<br><br>
A front edge portion of the main pipe side cover 22 Is formed In an inclined face which recedes rearwardly from a front portion to a rear portion such that It extends along a rear edge portion of the Inner shield 21 described above, and a plurality of attachment bosses 22a are provided In a row on a front edge portion of the main pipe side cover 22. The rear edge portion of the inner shield 21 is movably secured to the attachment bosses 22a by means of screws b as described hereinabove. Attachment bosses 22b are perforated in a spaced relationship from each other in the upward and downward direction at intermediate portions of the main pipe side cover 22. The attachment bosses 22b are secured to the first bosses 20c by means of screws b to removably attach the leg shield body 20 to the main pipe side cover 22.<br>
Meanwhile, the upper edge portion of the main pipe side cover 22 is formed as a convex curved face, and a front top cover 23 is secured to the upper edge portion of the main pipe side cover 22. Further, a rear edge of the main pipe side cover 22 is formed in a concave face shape such that it extends along an upper face of the main pipe 2, and a main pipe top cover 24 is secured to the rear edge of the main pipe side cover 22.<br>
It is to be noted that securing means for securing the front top cover 23 and main pipe top cover 24 to the<br><br>
main pipe side cover 22 are same as conventionally known securing means, and therefore, detailed description of the same is omitted.<br>
Attachment holes 22c to the body frame F are perforated at upper portions of a rear edge portion and a rear end portion of the main pipe side cover 22, and the main pipe side cover 22 is secured to the bracket 30 on the side face of the main pipe 2 of the body frame F through the attachment holes 22c by means of screws b as described hereinabove. Further, attachment holes 22d and 22e for attaching an under cover 25 which is hereinafter described are perforated in a lower portion of the main pipe side cover 22.<br>
The under cover 25 is removably attached to a lower end portion of the main pipe side cover 22. The under cover 25 covers a front portion of the engine unit Eu and is attached to and used for the main pipe side cover 22 when necessary, and is made of a material same as that of the leg shield Ls described above and the main pipe side cover 22.<br>
As shown in FIGS. 12A, 12B and 12C, the under cover 25 is formed in a U-shape whose rear face is open, and the opposite outer side faces 25a of the under cover 25 are gradually expanded with respect to the body frame F from front portions toward rear portions thereof.   And, the<br><br>
under cover 25 is removably attached to attachment holes 22d and 22e at a lower end of the main pipe side cover 22 through attachment pieces 25b and 25c at upper edges thereof (refer to FIGS. 1 and 2).<br>
It is to be noted that, in FIGS. 1 and 2, reference character E denotes an ending body of the engine unit Eu, AC an air cleaner, and CB a carburetor.<br>
Now, a second working example of the present invention is described with reference to FIGS. 13 to 20. In the figures, like elements to those of the first working example described hereinabove are denoted by like reference characters.<br>
According to the present second working example, even if a leg shield is removed from the body frame F, a good appearance of the motorcycle itself is maintained, and more particularly, the inside cannot be observed through the gap between the front top cover 23 and the main pipe side cover 22 in a state wherein the leg shield Ls is removed. Further, the front top cover 23 is supported on a stay 36 for attachment of a basket 37 provided forwardly of the head pipe.<br>
As shown in FIGS. 14 and 17, a rib piece 23b is extended rearwardly integrally from a rear face of each of end edge portions 23a on the opposite left and right sides of the front top cover 23 such that an air gap portion d of<br><br>
a V-shaped transverse section which is open to the rear is formed by the end edge portion 23a and the rib piece 23b. Front edge portions 22f of the main pipe side cover 22 are inserted in the air gap portions d. The front edge portions 22f overlap in the forward and backward direction with the rib pieces 23b described above, and the front edge portions 22f overlap also with the end edge portions 23a of the front top covers 23. Accordingly, even in a state wherein any of the leg shields Ls is removed from the main pipe side cover 22 as shown in FIGS. 15 and 17, the inside cannot be observed through the gap between the front top cover 23 and the main pipe side cover 22. Consequently, the motorcycle has a good appearance also where it is used in the state wherein any of the leg shields Ls is removed.<br>
On the other hand, where the leg shields Ls are attached to the main pipe side covers 22, attachment bosses 20e provided in an integrally projecting manner in the proximity of an upper edge of each of the leg shields Ls are fixed to an upper portion of the main pipe side cover 22 by means of screws b, and upper edge portions e of the leg shield Ls contact with rear faces of the end edge portions 23a of the front top cover 23 so that the leg shield Ls is restricted from moving forwardly. Accordingly, a gap is not formed between the upper edge portions e of the leg shield Ls and the end edge portions 23a of the<br><br>
front top cover 23, and a good appearance is maintained.<br>
As shown in FIGS. 17 and 19, a T-shaped stay 36 is secured to a front end face of a bracket 35 which is provided integrally on and extends forwardly from the head pipe 1, and a basket 37 positioned forwardly of the front top cover 23 is secured to and supported by the stay 36 with the front top cover 23 interposed therebetween. In particular, attachment screws 38 extending through a plurality of boss portions 37a provided integrally on a rear face of the basket 37 extend through the front top cover 23 and are fastened to the stay 36 described above. Consequently, the front top cover 23 can be supported by the attachment stay 36 of the basket 37, and the attachment structure therefor is simplified and the attaching operation is facilitated.<br>
As shown in FIG. 18, folded back edge portions 22g are formed on the opposite left and right sides of an upper portion of the main pipe side cover 22, and insertion holes 22h are perforated in the folded back edge portions 22g. Insertion pieces 23c provided in a projecting manner on inner faces of an upper portion of the front top cover 23 are inserted into the left and right insertion holes 22h. Consequently, the opposite sides of the upper portion of the front top cover 23 are inserted in and supported by the insertion holes 22h of the main pipe side cover 22.<br><br>
Accordingly, the positions of the opposite left and right sides of the front top cover 23 can be restricted so as not to move in the widthwise direction only by inserting them into the insertion holes 22h of the left and right main pipe side covers 22. Further, since the folded back edge portions 22g of the main pipe side cover 22 described above are inclined toward the front top cover 23 side and the folded back edge portions 22g and the end edge portions 23a of the front top cover 23 overlap with each other as viewed from a side, even if the leg shield Ls is removed, the inside cannot be observed through gaps between the folded back edge portions 22g and the end edge portions 23a.<br>
While working examples of the present invention are described above, the present invention is not limited to the specific working examples and allows various working examples within the scope thereof. For example, while, in the working examples described above, the leg shield is formed from a leg shield body and an inner shield, and it may otherwise be formed only from a leg shield body. In this instance, the leg shield body is attached directly to a main pipe side cover. Further, while, in the working examples, a front wall portion and a rear wall portion are formed integrally with the leg shield body, they may otherwise be formed as separate members. Furthermore, while, in the working examples, front and rear portions of<br><br>
the inner shield are fastened to the leg shield body and the main pipe side cover by means of a screw, engagement between a pawl and an engaging hole may alternatively be used for one of them while fastening by means of a screw is used for the other of them. Furthermore, since the leg shield described above is formed as a hollow member, the hollow inside thereof can be used as an accommodation section. In this instance, an entrance/exit for the accommodation section is preferably open to a location which cannot be observed readily from the outside, for example, to a rear wall portion of the leg shield.<br><br>
