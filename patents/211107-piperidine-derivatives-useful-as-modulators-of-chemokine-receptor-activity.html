COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10, rule 13]<br>
"PIPERIDINE      DERIVATIVES      USEFUL      AS      MODULATORS      OF CHEMOKINE RECEPTOR ACTIVITY"<br>
AstraZeneca AB, a Swedish company of S-151 85 Sodertalje, Sweden,<br>
The following specification particularly describes and ascertain the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br><br><br>
The present invention concerns piperidine derivatives having pharmaceutical activity, to processes for preparing such derivatives, to pharmaceutical compositions comprising such derivatives and to the use of such derivatives as active therapeutic agents.<br>
Pharmaceutically active piperidine derivatives are disclosed in(W099/38514, WO99/04794 and W'OOO/35877.<br>
Chernokines are chemotactic cytokines that are released by a wide variety of cells to attract macrophages, T cells, eosinophils, basophils and neutrophils to sites of inflammation and also play a role in the maturation of cells of the immune system. Chernokines play an important r61e in immune and inflammatory responses in various diseases and disorders, including asthma and allergic diseases, as well as autoimmune pathologies such as rheumatoid arthritis and atherosclerosis. These small secreted molecules are a growing superfamily of 8-14 kDa proteins characterised by a conserved four cysteine motif. The chemokine superfamily can be divided into two main groups exhibiting characteristic structural motifs, the Cys-X-Cys (C-X-C, or a) and Cys-Cys (C-C, or (3) families. These are distinguished on the basis of a single amino acid insertion between the NH-proximal pair of cysteine residues and sequence similarity.<br>
The C-X-C chernokines include several potent chemoattractants and activators of neutrophils such as interleukin-8 (IL-8) and neutrophil-activating peptide 2 (NAP-2).<br>
The C-C chernokines include potent chemoattractants of monocytes and lymphocytes but not neutrophils such as human monocyte chemotactic proteins 1-3 (MCP-1, MCP-2 and MCP-3), RANTES (Regulated on Activation, Normal T Expressed and Secreted), eotaxin and the macrophage inflammatory proteins lα and 1|3 (MIP-lα and<br>
MIP-1β). .<br>
Studies have demonstrated that the actions of the chernokines are mediated by subfamilies of G protein-coupled receptors, among which are the receptors designated CCR1, CCR2, CCR2A, CCR2B, CCR3, CCR4, CCR5, CCR6, CCR7, CCR8, CCR9, CCR10..CXCR1, CXCR2, CXCR3 and CXCR4. These receptors represent good targets for drug development since agents which modulate these receptors would be useful in the treatment of disorders and 'diseases such as those mentioned above.<br>
Histamine is a basic amine, 2-(4-imidazolyl)-ethylamine, and is formed from histidine by histidine decarboxylase. It is found in most tissues of the body, but is present<br>
2-<br><br>
in high concentrations in the lung, skin and in the gastrointestinal tract. At the cellular level inflammatory cells such as mast cells and basophils store large amounts of histamine. It is recognised that the degranulation of mast cells and basophils and the subsequent release of histamine is a fundamental mechanism responsible for the clinical manifestation of an allergic process. Histamine produces its actions by an effect on specific histamine G-protein coupled receptors, which are of three main types, HI, H2 and H3. Histamine HI antagonists comprise the largest class of medications used in the treatment of patients with allergic disorders, especially rhinitis and urticaria. Antagonists of HI are useful in controlling the allergic response by for example blocking the action of histamine on post¬capillary venule smooth muscle, resulting in decreased vascular permeability, exudation and oedema. The antagonists also produce blockade of the actions of histamine on the HI receptors on c-type nociceptive nerve fibres, resulting in decreased itching and sneezing.<br>
Viral infections are known to cause lung inflammation. It has been shown experimentally that the common cold increases mucosal output of eotaxin in the airways. Instillation of eotaxin into the nose can mimic some of the signs and symptoms of a common cold. (See, Greiff L et al Allergy (1999) 54(11) 1204-8 [Experimental common cold increase mucosal output of eotaxin in atopic individuals] and Kawaguchi M et al Int. Arch. Allergy Immunol. (2000) V22 S1 44 [Expression of eotaxin by normal airway epithelial cells after virus A infection].)<br>

EXAMPLE 17 Pharmacological Analysis: Calcium flux [Ca 2+]i assay Human eosinophils<br>
Human eosinophils were isolated from EDTA anticoagulated peripheral blood as previously described (Hansel et al., /. Immunol. Methods, 1991, 145,105-110). The cells were resuspended (5x 106 ml-1) and loaded with 5uM FLUO-3/AM + Pluronic F127 2.2ui/ml (Molecular Probes) in low potassium solution (LKS; NaCl 118mM, MgSO40.8mM, glucose 5.5mM, Na2C03 8.5mM, KC1 5mM, HEPES 20mM, CaCl2 1.8mM, BSA 0.1%, pH 7.4) for<br>
one hour at room temperature. After loading, cells were centrifuged at 200g for 5min and resuspended in LKS at 2.5x106 ml"1. The cells were then transferred to 96 well FLIPr plates (Poly-D-Lysine plates from Becton Dickinson pre-incubated with 5|lM fibronectin for two hours) at 25|il/well. The plate was centrifuged at 200g for 5min and the cells were washed twice with LKS (200(xl; room temperature).<br>
A compound of the Examples was pre-dissolved in DMSO and added to a final concentration of 0.1 %(v/v) DMSO. Assays were initiated by the addition of an A50 concentration of eotaxin and the transient increase in fluo-3 fluorescence (1EX =490nm and km = 520nm) monitored using a FLTPR (Fluorometric Imaging Plate Reader, Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, U.S.A.).<br>
Compounds of the Examples were found to be antagonists if the increase in fluorescence induced by eotaxin (a selective CCR3 agonist) was inhibited in a concentration dependent manner. The concentration of antagonist required to inhibit the fluorescence by 50% can be used to determine the IC50 for the antagonist at the CCR3 receptor.<br>
Human eosinophil chemotaxis Human eosinophils were isolated from EDTA anticoagulated peripheral blood as previously described (Hansel et al., J. Immunol. Methods, 1991, 145,105-110). The cells were resuspended at 10x106 ml-1 in RPM containing 200 IU/ml penicillin, 200 |ig/ml streptomycin sulfate and supplemented with 10% HTFCS, at room temperature.<br>
Eosinophils (700 µl) were pre-incubated for 15 mins at 37° C with 7 ui of either vehicle or compound (lOOx required final concentration in 10% DMSO). The chemotaxis plate (ChemoTx, 3µm pore, Neuroprobe) was loaded by adding 28pµl of a concentration of eotaxin 0.1 to 100nM (a selective CCR3 agonist over this concentration range) containing a concentration of a compound according to the Examples or solvent to the lower wells of the<br><br>
chemotaxis plate. The filter was then placed over the wells and 25 µl of eosinophil suspension were added to the top of the filter. The plate was incubated for 1 hr at 37° C in a humidified incubator with a 95% air/5% CCS atmosphere to allow chemotaxis.<br>
The medium, containing cells that had not migrated, was carefully aspirated from above the filter and discarded. The filter was washed once with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) containing 5 mM EDTA to remove any adherent cells. Cells that had migrated through the filter were pelleted by centrifugation (300xg for 5 mins at room temperature) and the filter removed and the supernatant transferred to each well of a 96-well plate (Costar). The pelleted cells were lysed by the addition of 28 ul of PBS containing 0.5% Triton xl00 followed by two cycles of freeze/thawing. The cell lysate was then added to the supernatant. The number of eosinophils migrating was quantified according to the method of Strath et al., J. Immunol. Methods, 1985, .83, 209 by measuring eosinophil peroxidase activity in the supernatant.<br>
Compounds of the Examples were found to be antagonists of eotaxin mediated human eosinophil chemotaxis if the concentration response to eotaxin was shifted to the right of the control curve. Measuring the concentration of eotaxin required to give 50% chemotaxis in the presence or absence of compounds enables the apparent affinity of the compounds at CCR3 to be calculated.<br>
