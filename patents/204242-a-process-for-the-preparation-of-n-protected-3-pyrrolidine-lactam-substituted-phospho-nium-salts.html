The reaction of step (a) can optionally be carried via a two step procedure. First, the asparagine derivatives of formula V is treated with 0,5 - 2.0 equivalents, preferably 1.0-1.5 equivalents of a base such as NaH, NaOH or KOH, preferably with NaH in an appropriate solvent to obtain the cyclic compound of formula A.

March (1992), "Advanced Organic Chemistry: Reactions, Mechanisms, and Structure" 4* ed. John Wiley 8c Sons) to obtain the corresponding 1-N-substituted 3-amino protected-2,5-dioxo-pyrrolidine of formula VI.<br>
Asparagine derivatives of formula V are commercially available or can be synthesized according to methods known from textbooks on organic chemistry (e.g. J. March (1992), "Advanced Organic Chemistry: Reactions, Mechanisms, and Structure", 4th ed. John Wiley &amp; Sons) for example starting with D- or L-asparagine (Fluka) protection of the free amino function and subsequent esterification to obtain the corresponding asparagine derivatives of formula V.<br>
The advantage of carrying out the reaction of step (a) via a two step procedure is that the compounds of formula VI are obtained in higher yield. The two step procedure is also a part of the present invention.<br>
In step (b) of the process the amino protecting group (R2) of the compounds of formula VI is removed under condition described below. Preferred amino protecting groups for R2 are benzyloxycarbpnyl, tert-butoxycarbonyl or allyloxycarbonyl, most preferred benzyloxycarbonyl. The benzyloxycarbonyl amino protecting group is for example removed under hydrogenation conditions in the presence of a catalyst such as Pd/C (commercially available from Degussa) preferably with 10% Pd on activated carbon. The deprotection reactions are carried out in the presence of acetic acid, trifluoroacetic<br><br>
acid, ethanolic HCI, methanesulphonic acid or fluorosuphonic acid to obtain the corresponding amino salt of formula VII which is more stable than the free base and therefore can be stored without degradation. In a preferred embodiment acetic acid is used to prepare the acetic acid salt of formula VII. The reaction is carried out at a temperature between about 10°C and about 50°C, preferably between about 20°C and about 40°C.<br>
Depending on the amino protecting groups the deprotection is carried out as follows:<br>
The amino protecting groups maybe cleaved off by acid hydrolysis (e.g. the tert-butoxycarbonyl or trityl group), e.g. aqueous formic acid, trifluoroacetic acid or by basic hydrolysis (e.g. the trifluoroacetyl group). Further protecting groups maybe cleaved off by hydrazinolysis (e.g. the phthalimido group). The allyloxycarbonyl group maybe cleaved off by Pd catalysed transfer to nucleophiles. The chloroacetyl, bromoacetyl and iodoacetyl groups are cleaved off by treatment with thiourea.<br>
Amino protecting groups which are cleavable by acid hydrolysis are preferably removed with the aid of a lower alkanecarboxylic acid which may be halogenated. In particular, formic acid or trifluoroacetic acid is used. The reaction is carried out in the acid or in the presence of a co-solvent such as a halogenated lower alkane, e.g. methylene chloride. The acid hydrolysis is generally carried out at room temperature, although it can be carried out at a slightly higher or slightly lower temperature (e.g. a temperature in the range of about -30°C to 40°C). Protecting groups which are cleavable under basic conditions are generally hydrolyzed with dilute aqueous caustic alkali at 0°C to 30°C. The chloroacetyl, bromoacetyl and iodoacetyl protecting groups can be cleaved off using thiourea in acidic, neutral or alkaline medium at about 0°C to 30°C.<br>
In step (c) of the process the amino salt compound of formula VII is treated with a base such as NaOH, KOH, Na2C03 or K2CO3 preferably with NaOH in aqueous solution to adjust the pH in the ranges from 7.0 to 9.0, preferably in the range from 7.5 to 8.5 in the presence of a halogenated hydrocarbon such as monochloromethane or dichloromethane, preferably dichloromethane, to remove the acid and to obtain the intermediate acid free compound of formula VII. The intermediate is then worked-up by extraction with a halogenated hydrocarbon such as monochloromethane or dichloromethane, preferably dichloromethane and then the organic solvent is evaporated. Subsequently, the acid free derivative of formula VII is reduced with a reducing agent such as Vitride®, NaBH4, LiBH4, LiAlH4, BH3»THF, preferably with Vitride®, to obtain the amino pyrrolidine of formula II. The reducing agents are commercially available from Aldrich or Fluka. The reaction is carried out in an aromatic solvent such as toluene, o-xylene, m-xylene, p-xylene<br><br>
or benzene, preferably with toluene at a reaction temperature between about -iuw^ ana about 100°C, preferably starting at 0°C; during the reaction the temperature is increased to 80°C. Then, the mixture is cooled to a temperature between about -20°C and about 20°C, preferably to a temperature between about -10°C and about 10°C and treated with a base such as sodium hydroxide in aqueous solution.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the process steps a-c are carried out for compounds wherein * signifies an asymmetric center with (R) configuration and R1 is methyl or ethyl, preferably methyl and R is benzyloxycarbonyl, tert-butoxycarbonyl or allyloxycarbonyl, preferably benzyloxycarbonyl and X is chlorine or bromine, preferably bromine.<br>
The compounds of formula I-VII are important building blocks for the production of useful products in the chemical and pharmaceutical industry. In particular they are useful for the production of antibacterial substances for example vinylpyrrolidinone-cephalosporin derivatives as described in EP-A 0 849 269. Preferably compounds of formula I-VII are useful for the preparation of compounds of formula VIII<br><br>
wherein R is a hydroxy protecting group, R is a carboxylic acid protecting group, * is as defined above and R is an amino protecting group preferably a tert-butoxycarbonyl group or a group of formula B<br><br>
wherein R6 is preferably an unsubstituted straight chain or branched alkyl group containing 1 to 4 carbon atoms, more preferred methyl, ethyl or isopropyl and most preferred methyl.<br>
