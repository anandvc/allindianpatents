				<td>CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
This application claims priority to U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 10/876,948 entitled "Improved Synthesis of ^/iwr-Metallocenes and Their Parent Ligands in High Yield," which was filed on June 25,2004 and is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to the fields of organic synthesis and organometallic synthesis, including synthetic methods for ansa-mctallocenes, and their parent ligands.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Metallocene compounds constitute useful catalyst components for a variety of chemical transformations including olefin polymerizations, where metallqcenes are often used in combination with a variety of cocatalysts. It is generally accepted that the metallocene structure itself is intimately involved in determining the physical properties of the resulting polyolefin and hence its eventual usefulness in a variety of end-use applications such as in film, pipe and blow-molded articles. Therefore, there is a need to develop new methods to prepare metallocenes that allow an assortment of substituents to be incorporated<br>
into the metallocene structure.<br>
It is likewise of interest to develop new methods to prepare bridged or ansa-metallocene compounds, which comprise two r|5-cyclopentadienyl-type ligands linked by a chemical spacer. A variety of substituents can he incorporated into the ansa-metallocene structure, including substituents on the cyclopentadienyl-type ligands, on the bridging group, or both, each of which helps determine the.physical properties of polyolefins prepared using these compounds. To accomplish this task, it is also of interest to develop new preparative methods for the <mya-raetaflocene parent ligand comprising two cyclopentadienyl-type groups linked by a bridging group.></mya-raetaflocene>
DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention encompasses methods for the synthesis of organic compounds comprising two cyclopentadienyl-type groups linked by a bridging group, which constitute useful ligaads in preparing ansa-metallocene complexes. These anse-metallocenes can be used subsequently as catalyst components in olefin polymerizations. In one aspect, the methods of this invention generajly afford higher yields of the desired product than were heretofore available. In one aspect, for example, the methods disclosed herein permit a range of substituents to be incorporated into the ligand and the ansa-metallocene, which in turn can affect and determine the physical properties of polyolefins prepared using these compounds.<br>
In one aspect of this invention, a method is provided for the synthesis of compounds comprising linked cyclopentadienyl and fiuorenyl groups, inchlding substituted analogs thereof, which are precursors to anra-metalloeenes comprising bridged cyclopentadienyl and fiuorenyl iigands. However, this method is also applicable to ligands comprising linked cyclopentadienyl and indenyl groups, indenyl and fiuorenyl groups, two cyclopentadienyl groups, two indenyl groups, or two fluoreny} groups. This invention will be illustrated throughout by examples for the preparation of linked cyclopentadienyl and fiuorenyl groups and onjfl-metaJJocenes comprising bridged cyclopentadienyl and fluorenyl ligands. In this aspect, for example, this invention provides a new high-yield method for making the metallocene, (S-cyclopentadienylJtS^J-di-tert-butylfluorenylJJhex-l-ene zirconium dichloridc, as well as its parent ligand, (5-cyclopentadienyl)[5-(2,7-di-tert-butylfiuarenyl)]hex~l-enc. However, many variations' in the substitution patterns for this ligand and criura-metallocene are possible, as disclosed herein.<br>

^—'•&gt;    (HI) to form a second mixture, wherein the limiting reagent has substantially reacted; and<br>
c)	contacting the second mixture with a proton source to form a third mixture<br><br>
Rs<br>
(Figure Remove)<br>
R2<br>
comprising	v^jf	(I), including isomers thereof;<br>
wherein:<br>
R! and R* are independently selected from an aliphatic or substituted aliphatic group having from 1 to 20 carbon atoms, or hydrogen; and<br>
R3, in each instance, is independently selected from an aliphatic or substituted aliphatic group having from 1 to 20 carbon atoms, or hydrogen.<br>
This method provides I in at least 85% yield, at least 90% yield, or at feast 95% yield.<br>
In the formulas I, n, and m, R1 and R2 can be independently selected from an aliphatic or substituted aliphatic group having from 1 to 20 carbon atoms, or hydrogen; and R3, in each instance, is independently selected from an aliphatic or substituted aliphatic group having from 1 to 20 carbon atoms, or hydrogen. Examples of aliphatic groups, in each instance, include, but are not limited to, an alkyl group, a cycloalkyl group, an alkenyl group,<br>
a cycloalkenyl group, an alkynyl group, an alkadienyl group, a cyclic group, and the like, and includes all substituted, unsubstituted, branched, and linear analogs or derivatives thereof, in each instance having from one to 20 carbon atoms. Thus, aliphatic groups include, but are not Limited to, hydrocarbyls such as paraffins and alkenyls. For example, aliphatic groups as used herein include methyl, ethyl, propyl, n-butyl, left-butyl* sec-butyl, isobutyl, amyl, isoamyl, hexyl, cyclohexyl, heptyl, octyl, nonyl, decyl, dodecyl, 2-ethylhexyl, pentenyl, butenyl, and the like.<br>
The term isomers thereof, when used to describe the compound of formula I, is generally used to indicate mat this method can provide enantiomers or diastereomere which, can arise depending upon the identity of R1, R2, and each R3 moiety, all of which are independently selected, and this method can also provide regioisomers resulting from where the bridging group bonds to the cyclopentadienyl ring. The regioisomers of I would likely arise as a result of the regiochemistry of protonating the anionic complex formed from the reaction of Li(B) with III.<br>
In another aspect, this method for making the ligand I comprises contacting a compound of the formula II and aft alkyl lithium reagent in an ethereal solvent to form a first mixture, wherein compound II is substantially deprotonated to form Li(n). In this aspect, this deprotonation reaction can by typically carried out with an equimolar amount of II and an alkyl lithium reagent, or with a slight excess of either, but is typically carried out with from 1.1 to 1.2 molar equivalents of alkyl lithium reagent so mat compound II is substantially deprotonated to form U(H). In mis aspect, the alkyl lithium reagent that can be used is any alkyl lithium reagent mat allows! to be prepared in at least 85% yield, including, but not limited to MeLi, n-BuLi, t-BuLi, n-hexylLi, LiCHzSiMes, LiCHaPh, LiCHiCMej, or any combination thereof. Therefore, the n and the alkyl lithium reagent react to form Li(H) in at least 85% yield to be substantially deprotonated, however, typically, II and the alkyl lithium reagent react to form U(II) in at least 9.0% yield, at least 95% yield, or at least 98% yield. While other reagents may be used to deprotonate n, the lithium alkyls, including n-BuLi, work well in this synthetic method. Thus, in this aspect, the duration of the contact time between n and an alkyl lithium reagent is typically that time necessary to substantially deprotonate II, that is the time necessary to form Li(II) in at least 85% yield, at least 90% yield, at least 95% yield, or at least 98% yield<br>
The ethereal solvent used in this method, can be independently selected from a range of ethereal solvents, including, but not limited to, dimethyl ether, diethyl ether, diisopropyl ether, di-n-propyl ether, di-n-butyl ether, methyl t-butyl ether, diphenyl ether, THF, 1,2-dimetboxyethane, or any combination thereof. In one aspect, the ethereal solvent can be diethyl ether, THF, or any combination thereof, and in another aspect, the ethereal solvent can comprise diethyl ether.<br>
In another aspect of the invention, the rapid combination of a fluorenyl compound Li(H) with a fulvene compound in is typically carried out over a time period of less than 5 minutes, less man 4 minutes, less than 3 minutes, less than 1 minutes, less than 1 minute, less than 45 seconds, less than 30 seconds, or less than 15 seconds. In mis aspect, the rapid combination of Li(Bl) with HI can also be carried out over a time period of less than 1 minute, less than 50 seconds, less titan 40 seconds, less than 30 seconds, less than 20 seconds, or leas man 10 seconds. This combination time for the fluorenyl and the fulvene compounds is different than the total contact time between these compounds, prior to proceeding to the subsequent step in the process. The combination time describes the elapsed time over which Hie addition of the fulvene to the ethereal solution of me fluorenyl, or alternatively, the addition of the ethereal solution of fluorene compound to the fulvene, is initiated and completed.<br>
While not intending to be bound by theory, one explanation of why the rapid combination of the fulvene and the ethereal solution of the lithium fluorenyl results in high yields is as follows. It is possible that an intermediate, mono-Uthiated species, namely Li(l), forms relatively quickly upon reacting Li(DE) with m. Again, while not intending to be bound by theory, it is also possible mat Li(H) could engage in a slower deprotonation reaction of Li(I) to form LizOO, along with fluorene. In mis situation, slow combination of in to Li(II) might be expected to allow rapidly-formed ti(I) to be present together in solution with unreacted Li(H) for a sufficient period of time for the Li(H) to deprotonate Li(I) to form l*i(I). This process would, in turn, be expected to lower the yield of Li(I) and its product I that would form upon quenching this reaction mixture with a proton source. In contrast, and again while not intending to be bound by theory, the rapid combination of IH and Li(II) might be expected to form Li(I) quioldy and deplete the Li(II) before it could engage in the slower reaction with Li(I) to the extent necessary to reduce the yield of I.<br>
Still another aspect of this invention is the combination of the ethereal solution of Li(U) and HI, which is typically carried out using from a 1:1 molar ratio to a 1:1,5 molar ratio of Li(II):in. This preparative method works with an excess of either reagent, but also works well using a 1:1 molar ratio of these reagents. In the event there is an excess of one reagent over the other, the limiting reagent in mis reaction can be present in at least 50% the mole fraction of the non-limiting reagent, at least 75% the mole fraction of the non-limiting reagent, or at least 90% the mole fraction of the non-limiting reagent. Also in the aspect, in the combination of the ethereal solution of Li(II) and m, typically in is present in slight excess over Li(II).<br>
In yet another aspect of the present invention, the concentration of the Li(Il) compound in the first mixture, prior to rapidly combining mis ethereal Li(II) solution with the fulvene compound HI, can be from 0.2 M (molar) to 2.0 M. This Li(II) concentration in the first mixture, prior to rapidly combining this mixture with in, can also be from 0.5 M to \ .8 M, from 0.7 M to 1.5 M, or from 1,0 M.to 1.2 M. Further, this Li(H) concentration in the first mixture, prior to rapidly combining thia mixture with m, can also be 0.5 M, 0.6 M, 0.7 M, 0.8 M, 0.9 M, 1.0 M, 1.1 M, 1.2 M, 1.3 M, 1.4 M, 1.5 M, 1.6 M, 1.7 M, 1.8 M, 1.9 M, or 2.0 M.<br>
Because the method of making I provides mis compound in at least 85% yield, the preparative method, in the event mere is an excess of one reagent over the other in the combination of the ethereal solution of Li(H) and m, at least 85% of the limiting reagent reacts, at least 90% of the limiting reagent reacts, or at least 95% of the limiting reagent reacts. Thus, in this aspect, the duration of the contact time between Li(H) and EQ is typically that time necessary such that the limiting reagent has substantially reacted, that is the time necessary for at least 85% of the limiting reagent to be consumed, at least 90% of the limiting reagent be consumed, or at least 95% of the limiting reagent be consumed.<br>
In another aspect, this invention encompasses contacting the second mixture, formed from rapidly combining the ethereal solution of Li(II) with HI, with a proton source to form a third mixture comprising I. The proton source for this step carl be any proton source that protonates the Li(II) with in contact product to provide I. In this aspect, the proton source can comprise water, an aqueous acid, an aqueous ammonium salt, or any combination thereof. The proton source can also be water, an aqueous acid, an aqueous ammonium salt, or any combination thereof. While not required, when the proton source comprises or is an<br>
aqueous acid, the aqueous acid can be relatively dilute, for example, from 0.5 M to 4 M. Typically, the proton source comprises an aqueous ammonium salt<br>
This method for making compound I can further comprise isolating compound I. Compound I can typically be isolated in at least 85% yield. For example, the method of this invention can further comprise removing the volatile components from the third mixture to provide a residue comprising I, optionally contacting or triturating the residue with a solvent in which I is substantially insoluble andTH is.solublc, and isolating I. Thus, by describing the trituration solvent as a solvent in which I is substantially insoluble and m is soluble, it is intended that this solvent would provide for the isolation of I in the yields disclosed herein.<br>
Examples of solvents that are useful in this trituration include, but are not limited to, an alcohol, including, but not limited to an alcohol having up to 8 carbon atoms. Examples of trituration solvents that can be used in mis .aspect of the invention include, but are not limited to, methanol, ethanol, i-propanol, n-propanol, n-butanol, sec-butanol, t-butanol, 1-hexanol, 2-hexanol, 3-hexanol, any mixture thereof, or any combination thereof. Typically, the trituration solvent can comprise methanol, ethanol, any mixture thereof, or any combination thereof. In this aspect, removing the volatile components of the third mixture can be achieved by any method known to one of ordinary skill in the art, including, but not limited to, evaporation, evaporation under reduced pressure, evaporation under the flow of a gas such as nitrogen, and the like. Similarly, isolating I following the optional trituration of the residue obtained upon removing the volatile components from the third mixture can be carried out by any method known to one of ordinary skill in the art, including, but not limited to, decanting the trituration solvent from the solid I, filtering off solid I, and the like.<br>
Yet another aspect of this invention is the temperature at which the various contact steps are initiated, and the temperature at which the various contact steps are allowed to proceed or run for their duration. These two temperatures can be different or they can be the same. In one aspect, the initiation temperature for a contact step is different than the run temperature. Thus, contacting II and an alkyl lithium reagent in an ethereal solvent to form a first mixture, can typically be initiated from room temperature to -100°C, from 0°C to -100°C, from -30°C to -95°C, or from -50°e to -9D°C, or from -70°C to -85 °C. In another aspect, contacting II and an alkyl lithium reagent in an ethereal solvent to form a first mixture, can typically be initiated at room temperature, at 0°C, at -20*C, at -40°C, or at -78°C. Once H and the alkyl lithium reagent have been contacted in an ethereal solvent to<br>
form a first mixture at the contact temperature, the first mixture can be maintained at one or more run temperatures for the duration of the contact step. In this aspect, for example, the run temperature can be from room temperature to -lOO'G, from OaC to -100°C, from -30°C to -95°C, or from -50°C to -90°C, or from -70°C to -85°C. In another aspect, this run temperature can be at room temperature, at 0"C, at -20°C, at -40°C, or at -78°C.<br>
In another aspect, rapidly combining the ethereal solution of Li(II) with a fulvene compound HI to form a second mixture, can typically be performed from room temperature to -100aC, from 0°C to -1QO°C, from -30SC to -95°C, or from -50°C to -90°C, or from -70°C to -85°C. The temperature at which this rapid combination occurs is the temperature at which the contact between Li(II) and in is initiated. Once initiated, the run temperature can be, for example, from room temperature to -100°Cj from 0°C to -100°C, from -30°C to -95°C, or from -50°C to -90°C, or from -70°C to -85°C. In another aspect, this ran temperature can be at-78°C.<br>

Scheme 1 illustrates one aspect of this invention for the synthesis of the parent ligand, in which typical conditions are exemplified. As shown in Scheme I, 1.1 to 1.2 molar equivalents of n-butyl lithium were added to 2;7-di-tert-butylfluarene (V) m diethyl ether at -78°G, men this mixture was allowed to warm to room temperature and was stirred for at least 12 hours. The reaction mixture was then cooled to -78°C and 1.4 molar equivalents 6-butenyl-6-methylrulvene (VI) were added to the reaction mixture as quickly as possible, typically in less man 1 minute. While not intending to be bound by theory, it is believed mat<br>
this rapid addition helped to boost the yield of the parent ligand. This reaction mixture was then typically allowed to warm to room temperature, and was stirred for at least 12 hours.<br>

The Li(Y) and VI reaction was then quenched using methods known in the an and the product was isolated as a crude white solid comprising VIL Further purification of the resulting parent ligand VII was then achieved through the use of a methanol wash, which afforded the parent ligand of a sufficiently high purity to he used in the subsequent metalloccne synthesis. Using an alcohol wash, typically a methanol wash, rather than recrystallization, also helped boost the yield of the product.<br>
If shorter reaction times were used, if pentane/EteO solvent mixtures of varying ratios were used for purification through crystallization of the crude ligand, or both, a reduction in the overall yield of the desired product -was observed.

Some of the preparative steps of this method encompass the preparation of the parent ligand that is used to prepare the ansa-metalloeene in subsequent steps. Therefore, the various aspects disclosed herein for the preparation of the parent ligand are also applicable to that portion of the arts-a-metallocene synthetic method that involved preparing the parent ligand, including but not limited to steps a, b, c, d and optional step e. Such aspects include, but are not limited to: contact time; solvents; combination time; initiation temperature; run temperature; alkyl lithium reagents; definitions of R1, R2, R3, substantial deprotonation.<br><br>
substantial reaction, and limiting reagent; molar ratios; proton sources; yields; trituration solvents; method of isolation of I, and the like.<br>
Also in this aspect, the first and the second alkyl lithium reagents are selected independently, that is independent of the selection of each other. Thus, the first alkyl lithium reagent that can be used is any alkyl lithium reagent mat allows I to be prepared in at least 85% yield, including, but not limited to MeLi, n-BuLi, t-BuLi, n-hexylLi, L4CH2SiMe3, LiCHjPh, LiCHjCMej, or any combination thereof. The second alkyl lithium reagent that can be used is any alkyl lithium reagent that allows I to be deprotonated to form Lii(I) in at least 85% yield, at least 90% yield, at least 95% yield, or at least 98% yield. Thus, the second alkyl lithium reagent that can be used is any alkyl lithium reagent that allows IV to be prepared in at least 85% yield, including, but not limited to MeLi, n-BuLi, t-BuLi, n-hexylLi, LiCHjSiMej, LiCHjPh, LiCH2CMe3, or any .combination thereof. While the first and the second alkyl lithium reagents are selected independently, n-BuLi is typically selected for the first alkyl lithium and the second alkyl lithium.<br>
While not intending to be bound by theory, the contact time between I and the at least 2 molar equivalents of a second alkyl lithium reagent is thought to affect the ansa-metallocene produced by this method. Accordingly, in this aspect, the contact time between I and the second alkyl lithium reagent can be at least 0,5 hour, at leant 1 hour, at least 2 hours, at least 3 hours, at least 4 hours, at least 5 hours, at least 6 hours, at least 7 hours, at least 8 hours, at least 9 hours, at least 10 hours, at least 11 hours, at least 12 hours, at least 13 hours, at least 14 hours, at least 15 hours, at least 16 hours, at least 17 hours, or at least 18 hours. Also in this aspect, the contact time between I and the second alkyl lithium reagent can be from 1 hour to 48 hours, from 3 hours to 30 hours, from 6 hours to 24 hours, from 8 hours to 20 hours, or from 10 hours to 18 hours.<br>
Similarly, the first and the second ethereal solvents are also selected independently, that is independent of the selection of each other. The first and second ethereal solvents used in this method, can be independently selected from a range of ethereal solvents, including, but not limited to, dimethyl ether, diethyl ether, diisopropyl ether, di-n-propyl ether, di-n-butyl ether, methyl t-butyl ether, diphenyl ether, THF, 1,2-dimethoxyethane, or any combination thereof. In one aspect, the first and second ethereal solvents can be independently selected from diethyl ether, THF, or any combination thereof, and in another aspect, the first and second ethereal solvents can independently comprise diethyl ether.<br><br>
In another aspect of this invention, the optional hydrocarbon cosolvent can be a range of aliphatic and aromatic cosolvents, but can be typically an aliphatic eosolvent. In one aspect, the optional hydrocarbon cosolvent can be butane, pentane, cyclopentane, hexane, heptane, cyctohexane, methyl cyclopentane, octane, or any combination thereof. In this aspect, pentane can be a typical optional cosolvent.<br>
The volatile components of die fifth mixture, like that of me third mixture, can be removed by any method known to one of ordinary skill in the art, including, but not limited to, evaporation, evaporation under reduced pressure, evaporation under the flow of a gas such as nitrogen, and the like.<br>
Similarly, in still another aspect of rats invention, the optional non-polar solvent that can be used to wash IV can be a range of non-polar solvents, including aliphatic or aromatic non-polar solvents. In this aspect, for example, the optional non-polar solvent can be butane, pentane, cyclopentane, hexane, heptane, cyclohexane, methyl cyclopentane, octane, or any combination thereof. Pentane can be a typical non-polar solvent used in this optional washing step of mis invention.<br>
While not intending to be bound by theory, it is believed mat the hydrocarbon, for example, pentane, wash functions primarily to improve the purity of the IV without sacrificing its yield, because the starting materials and by-products are soluble in solvents such as pentane, and IV is relatively insoluble (see Figures 1 and 2). If polar solvents such as ethereal solvents are used to wash die crude IV obtained after removing the reaction volatiles from die reaction mixture, die purity of IV is improved, but the yield of IV suffers because of its greater solubility in ethers as compared to pentane. Also while not intending to be bound by theory, it is believed that removing the reaction volatiles from the reaction mixture crude IV, rattier than decanting die reaction solvent, helps improve the overall yield of IV, because of the solubility of IV in ethereal solvents.<br>
In yet another aspect of this invention, the polar solvent that can be used to extract IV can be a range of polar solvents, including aliphatic or aromatic polar solvents. In this aspect, for example, the optional polar solvent can be CHCIj, CHzQz, 1,2-dichlorethane, or any combination thereof. In mis aspect, dichloromethane (CHjCh) is a typical polar solvent.<br>
In a further aspect, die optional aromatic solvent that can be used to crystallize IV, can be a range of aromatic solvents, including, bat not limited to, benzene, toluene, xylene,<br><br>
mesitylene, ethyl benzene, anisole, aniline, pyridine, 4-pbenylpyridine, or any combination thereof, including any isoraer thereof.<br>
Scheme 2 illustrates one aspect of this invention for the synthesis of the ansa-rnetalloceae VIII using the parent ligand VII .prepared according to this invention, in which typical conditions are exemplified. As shown in Scheme 2, the process for preparing Vin in high yield encompassed using an appropriate length of time for deprotonation of VII, as well as the use of proper extraction procedures. For example, increasing the time for the deprotonation reaction of the parent ligand Vn using n-butyl lithium from 6 hours to at least 12 hours prior to addition to zirconium tetrachloride, increased the yield of metallocene VUI. Removing the volatile components of the Lij(VH) and ZrCU reaction mixture, rather than simply concentrating the solution and crystallizing out the metallocene Vffl, afforded higher yields of VTQ Further, using pentane to wash the resulting residue or solid obtained from removing the reaction volatiles improved the purity of the desired product. Using a non-polar solvent such as pentane, rather than diethyl ether, to wash the resulting residue or solid obtained from removing the reaction volatiles improved the overall yield of the desired product.<br>

While metallocene VIII was somewhat soluble in non-polar solvents such as pentane, it was more soluble in polar solvents such as CHjCb, which served as a suitable extraction solvent. Figure I provides the *H NMR spectrum in CDCla solvent of the pentane extract, that is, the pentane wash liquid, used in the workup of the (5-cyclopentadienyl)[5-(2,7-di-tcrt-butylfluorenyl)Jhex-l-ene zirconium dichloride synthesis. While some metallocene product can be observed in this spectrum, additional byproducts that were removed by this wash are also observed. Figure 2 provides the 'H'NMR spectrum in CDCb solvent of the CHaCfe extract, that followed after a pentane washing step, from the solid product obtained during<br><br>
workup of the (5-cyclopentadienyl)[5-(2,7-di-tert-burylfluonmyl)]hex-l-ene zirconium dichloride synthesis. A high concentration of pore metallocene VHI is observed in this spectrum, illustrating the suitability of this method for preparing pure VDI, the suitability of pentane as a wash solvent to remove unwanted byproducts and unreacted starting material, and the suitability of CHjCk as an extraction and crystallization solvent The Examples provided herein disclose full details of the synthetic methods employed to provide the desired metallocene in high yield, and illustrate comparative preparations that provided the desired compound in lower yield.<br>
In an additional aspect of this invention, the entire sequence of parent ligand synthesis and metallocene preparation could be performed in a "one-pot" process, and a representative procedure for this one-pot synthesis is provided in the Examples. Although the one-pot method allowed anwz-metallocene VHI to be prepared in sufficiently high purity for further use, including, but not limited to, its use in olefin polymerization catalysis, me overall yield of VUJ was observed to be comparatively tower than that overall yield of VIII when the synthesis was conducted by first isolating the parent ligand VII.<br>
Yet another aspect of this invention is the preparation of a compound of the formula<br>

GENERAL DETAILS<br>
The solvents used in the following Examples were dried and distilled under nitrogen using standard methods.

Preparation	of	l~(methyl)-1^3-but0nyl)-l-tydapentadienyl)-l-(2,7-di-tert-<br>
bvtylfluQrenyljmethane by the reaction af2,7-di-tert-butylfluorenyl lithium and 6-butenyl-6-methylfulvene<br>
Preparation 1. A one-liter flask was charged with 2,7-di-ten-butylfluorene (50 g, 179.6 mrhol) and a stir bar, capped with a rubber septum, and placed under a nitrogen atmosphere. Oiethyl ether (about 200 mL) was added via a cannula, and the resulting mixture was cooled to -78°C in a dry-ice bath. This mixture was stored at this temperature as n-butyllithium (19.0 mL of 10 M in hexanes, 190 mmol) was added slowly via syringe. After the addition of n-butylUmium was complete, the reddish solution was slowly wanned to room temperature and stirred overnight (at least 12 hours). After this time, the reaction mixture was cooled to -78°C, and 6-butenyl-6-methylfulvene (40 mL) was added quickly (in less than 1 minute) at this temperature with stirring. On completion of the fulvone addition the mixture was removed from the dry ice bath and wanned to room temperature, and a GC aliquot taken after ca. 15 minutes following removal of the dry-ice bath. The GC analysis indicated 85.3% yield of the product had formed.<br>
Stirring was continued for 7 hours, after which time the reaction mixture was quenched with a saturated NHUCl/IfcO solution (300 mL). The organic layer was extracted with diethyl ether, washed twice with HjO (500 raL), dried over anhydrous Na2SO
the solid and the mixture stirred overnight to afford the product as a finely divided white solid. After filtration, washing with MeOH, and drying overnight, 76 g (89%) of the desired parent ligand l-(me%l)4^34&gt;utenyl)-l<cyclqpottadienyl was isolated and used without further purification.></cyclqpottadienyl>
Preparation 2. Following the same procedure as described in Preparation 1 above in a second preparation afforded 70 g (90%) of the desired compound.<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
Comparative preparation of 1-(methyl)-!-(3-butenyl)-l-(tychpentadienyl)-l-(2,7-di-tert-butylfluorenyl) methane — Method AI<br>
Preparation 1. A one-liter flask was charged with 2,7-di-tert-butylfluorene (50 g, 179.6 mrnol) and a stir bar, capped with.a rubber septum, and placed under a nitrogen atmosphere. Diethyl ether (about 300 mL) was added via a carmula, and the resulting mixture was cooled to -78°C in a dry-ice bath. This mixture was stirred at this temperature as n-butyllithium (21.5 mL of 10 M in hexanes, 215 mmol) was added slowly via syringe. After the addition of n-butyllithium was complete, the reddish solution was slowly wanned to room temperature and stirred overnight (at least 12 hours), to provide an ether solution of 2,7-di-/ert-burylfluorenyl lithium.<br>
Another one-liter flask fitted with an addition funnel was charged with 6-butenyl-6-methylfulvene (37 g, 253 mmol) and a stir bar, and cooled to 0°C under a nitrogen atmosphere. The ether solution of 2,7-di-jtert-butylfluorenyl lithium prepared as above was added in a dropwiae fashion to the fulvene at 0*C via the addition funnel over the course of approximately one hour. The resulting dark-colored reaction mixture was wanned to room temperature and stirred overnight (at least 12 hours) under a nitrogen atmosphere. The reaction mixture was then quenched with the slow addition of a saturated NHaCl/HjO solution (300 mL), the organic layer extracted wife etiier, washed twice with HjO (500 mL), dried over anhydrous Na2SO4, filtered, and the filtrate evaporated to dryness, The crude product obtained by this method was then dissolved in pentane and maintained at 0°C in a freezer, thereby affording the product as a white solid that was washed with cold pentane, dried under vacuum, and isolated and used without further purification (60.4 g, 79%). Further product could be isolated in smaller quantities through concentrating the mother liquors and combined washings and placing them back in freezer.<br>
Preparation 2. Another comparative preparation of the parent ligand 1-(methyl)-!-(3-butenyl)-l-(cyclopentadienyl)-I-(2,7-di-tert-butylfluorenyl)-methane according to the same reaction, work-up, and crystallization conditions as disclosed in Method Al, afforded 34.7 g (45% yield) of the desired product as a white solid.<br>
