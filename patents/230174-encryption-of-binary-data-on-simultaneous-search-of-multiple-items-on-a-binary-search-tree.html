				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
1.	Field of Invention:<br>
The invention relates to an Encryption and Decryption Method (EDM) having a<br>
microarchitecture microprogrammed with Adaptive Delta Modulation (ADM) procedure<br>
that modulates the locus of the search path to search all quantized bytes with the<br>
Interlaced Binary Search (IBS) algorithm to store and transmit an equivalent binary code<br>
using lesser number of serial bits' stream than that of the source binary file.<br>
2.	Background of Invention:<br>
In digital memory or digital data communication binary number system is in use<br>
that uses bits for representation of I or 0. Bits are further grouped into bytes (set of 8<br>
bits). A large number of bytes are used to store binary equivalent information in a file<br>
to be processed, stored, and transmitted by the computer system. Each byte is formed<br>
with the binary search algorithm on a search (with 8 trials) in a binary search tree of<br>
256 nodes corresponding to decimal digits from 0 to 255. For a binary file composed of<br>
'nk' bytes (8nk bits), there is requirement to store and transmit all '8nk' bits.<br>
The invention groups this '8nk' bits into 'n' groups of '8k' bits each. Each of<br>
these 'n' groups is termed as Quantized Bytes (Qb). The numbers corresponding to<br>
these n groups occupy into the binary search" tree formed by the first 28k natural<br>
numbers ranging from 0 to (28k-l). Interlaced binary search algorithm searches this 'n'<br>
Qb in this binary search tree. The locus of the search path so generated is adaptive<br>
delta modulated to store and transmit.<br>
The Interlaced Binary Search (IBS) algorithm removes the limitations of well-<br>
known binary search algorithm that are inability to search simultaneously multiple<br>
items and the limit of the seaVch efficiency by log2n. IBS is first used in the design of the<br>
interlaced analog to digital converter to microprogram the microarchitecture - refer<br>
the patent application no.45/cal/2002 (refer APPENDIX for a copy of the Abstract).<br>
Adaptive Delta Modulation (ADM) is a scheme of differential pulse code<br>
modulation (DPCM). In DPCM, instead of transmitting a base band signal m(t) on<br>
sampling and binary coding, at each sampling time (say time k), the difference between<br>
the sample value m(k) at sampling time k and the sample value m(k-l) at time (k-1) is<br>
transmitted. Obviously this difference will call for fewer bits for transmission. On the<br>
receiving end, the addition of this difference values will regenerate the actual signal.<br>
The number of bits in DPCM can again be reduced through delta modulation (DM). In<br>
DM m(k) is compared with regenerated signal up to m(k-l). This comparison facilitates<br><br>
just single bit transmission for just two possibilities - increase or decrease regenerated<br>
m(k). DIM has the limitation, that to go with large change in original signal there is<br>
requirement of high sampling rate; that again is limited by Nyquist rate. Nyquist rate is<br>
the minimum allowable sampling rate 2fM for exact recovery of a band-limited signal<br>
with fM as highest frequency spectral component. ADM overcomes this drawback on<br>
increase or decrease of quantization step size with fixed sampling rate. References.-(l)<br>

3. Object of Invention:<br>
The principal object of this invention is to reduce '8nk' bits of a binary file that will<br>
reduce storage size and increase transmission speed. The compression ratio (CR) that is the<br>
ratio of the number of bits after ADM to that of the original binary file comes in worst case as<br>
[(log2n +3p)/kj where p is the average number of trials per 'Qb' in the locus of the search path<br>
generated by the IBS algorithm.<br>
4.Summery of the invention:<br>
The invention relates to an Encryption and Decryption Method (EDM) having a<br>
microarchitecture microprogrammed with Adaptive Delta Modulation (ADM)<br>
procedure that modulates the locus of the search path to search all quantized bytes with<br>
the Interlaced Binary Search (IBS) algorithm to store and transmit an equivalent<br>
binary code using lesser number of serial bits' stream than that of the source binary<br>
file.<br>
The invention groups the '8nk' bits of any binary file containing 'nk' bytes in<br>
total, into 'n' groups of '8k' bits each. Each of these 'n' groups is termed as quantized<br>
bytes (Qb). The numbers corresponding to these n groups occupy into the binary search<br>
tree formed by first 28k natural numbers ranging from 0 to (28k-l). IBS algorithm<br>
searches the 'n' Qb in this binary search tree in a single run. The locus of the search<br>
path so generated is adaptive delta modulated to store and transmit. The compression<br>
ratio (CR) that is the ratio of the number of bits after ADM to that of the original<br>
binary file comes in worst case as [(log2n +3p)/k] where p is the average number of<br>
trials per 'Qb' in the locus of the search path generated by the IBS algorithm.<br><br>
5. Brief description of accompanying drawing:<br>
(501)	This complete specification enlists one (1) figure (FIGURE 1) that describes the<br>
flow chart of the microarchitecture. Different parts of the flow chart are:<br>
Quantizer (QTZ): Groups 'nk' bytes of the input source file into 'n' Qb (quantized<br>
byte) of 'k' bytes each.<br>
Adaptive Delta Modulator (ADM): Generates serial bit stream through the process<br>
of the adaptive delta modulation. It has two principal sections that are IBS and ENC<br>
described as follows.<br>
Interlaced Binary Search (IBS): Use IBS algorithm to generate the locus of search<br>
path to search 'n' Qb in the binary search tree formed by the first 28k natural numbers<br>
from 0 to (28k-l)<br>
Encoder (ENC): Encodes the locus of search path generated by the IBS.<br>
Communication Link: Serial Storage / Transmission of the serial bit stream produced<br>
by the ADM.<br>
Proxy-IBS: Mimics IBS of the ADM to generate 'n' Qb.<br>
Dequantizer (DQZ): Serializes 'n' Qb generated by the Proxy-IBS and so outputs the<br>
original file.<br>
Successive Analog Approximation (SAA): Recovers Qb in the high-level language<br>
implementation of the invention.<br><br><br><br>
6. Detail description of the invention with reference to the drawings:<br>
The invention relates to an encryption and decryption method having a<br>
microarchitecture microprogrammed with adaptive delta modulation (ADM)<br>
procedure that modulates the locus of the search path to search all quantized bytes with<br>
the interlaced binary search algorithm to store and transmit an equivalent binary code<br>
using lesser number of serial bits' stream than that of the source binary file.<br>
The invention is a scheme for reducing number of bits of a binary file on<br>
convergence in analog and digital computations. The scheme can be incorporated<br>
directly in hardware as micro-programmed control microarchitecture. The software-<br>
simulated implementation using software configuration of the microarchitecture is also<br>
possible. The nk bytes of a binary file are grouped sequentially into n groups of A bytes<br>
each. Each group is numbered sequentially with the first n natural numbers starting<br>
from 0 to (n-1). This numbers are identified as POS because POS gives the information<br>
of position. Instead of passing nk bytes for storage or transmission, the positions'<br>
information of these n groups in the binary' search tree formed by the first 28k natural<br>
numbers starting from 0 to (28k -1) along with POS is passed using fewer bits. This is a<br>
modulation scheme for processing discrete and quanta of analog signals - termed as<br>
quanta bytes (neither continuous nor defined by two states 1 or 0) - similar to that of<br><br>
processing continuous analog signal through adaptive delta modulation. The<br>
compression ratio (CR) that is the ratio of the number of bits after ADM to that of the<br>
original binary file comes in worst case as [(log2n +3p)/k] where p is the average<br>
number of trials per 'Qb' in the locus of the search path generated by the IBS<br>
algorithm.<br>
Quantizer (QTZ): The QTZ groups the '8nk' bits of any binary file containing<br>
'nk' bytes in total, into 'n' groups of '8k' bits each. Each of these 'n' groups is termed<br>
as Quantized Bytes (Qb). The numbers corresponding to these n groups occupy into the<br>
binary search tree formed by first 28k natural numbers ranging from 0 to (28k-I). Each<br>
Qb is numbered sequentially with the first /; natural numbers starting from 0 to (n-1).<br>
This numbers are identified as POS because POS gives the information of position.<br>
Table-1 and table-2 enlist bit configuration of the input binary file and the output of<br>
QTZ respectively.<br>
Each bits of the input source file that contains 'nk' bytes, is identified as Bwxv<br>
where w=0,l,2,3,4,5,6,7 identifies bits of a particular byte; x = 0,1, 2, (n-1) identifies the<br>
Qb to which the byte belongs to; and y = 0,1, 2, ,.., (k-1) identifies the position of the<br>
byte in the respective Qb. With reference to figure-1, table-1 and table-2 for a binary<br>
file of nk bytes each byte {B7xy, B6xy, B5xy,B4xy, B3xy, B2xy, B1xy, B0xy} is converted into<br>
analog signal equivalent Vxy (where x = 0,1, 2, (n-1) and y = 0,1, 2, ..., (k-1)) using<br>
equation-1. Vxy represents one of the possible 256 different values that can be<br>
represented by one byte. This Vxy analog signal equivalent is used to form Vx (x = 0, 1, 2,<br>
..., (n-1)) analog quanta - termed as Qb (Quantized byte) in the number system of base<br>
2s as per equation - 2. A Quantized byte (Qb) is a weighted sum of a set of bytes. A Qb<br>
is so termed to differentiate it simultaneously from continuous analog values and<br>
discrete digital values. The value of a Qb is any whole number in the range from 0 to<br><br><br><br>
Adaptive Delta Modulator (ADM): ADM receives the set of n Qb from QTZ<br>
and generates encoded serial bit stream. An ADM has two principal sections that are<br>
Interlaced Binary Search (IBS) and Encoder (ENC). IBS algorithm searches 'n' Qb in<br>
a single run through the binary search tree formed by first 28k natural numbers ranging<br>
from 0 to (28k-l). ENC encodes the locus of the search path so generated by the IBS.<br>
ADM outputs the serial bit stream that provides the locus of the search path and<br>
position information (POS) of n Qb" in that search path.<br>
Interlaced Binary Search (IBS): IBS is an improvement over well-known<br>
binary search. IBS removes limitations of binary search that are inability to search<br>
more than one item in a single run through the binary search tree and the search<br><br>
efficiency is limited by log2n. IBS searches simultaneously n Qb5 from a sorted list of 2q<br>
items where q=8k. Each item in the sorted list will be identified with a unique key<br>
number in the range from 0 to (2q-l). Our task will be to search for the key number<br>
associated with an item to search that item. In other words, we have a complete binary<br>
search tree T formed from first 2q positive numbers from 0 to (2q-l). The depth (or<br>
height) of T is q. We will search simultaneously n nodes in T.<br>
Binary Search: To search an Item in a sorted list, compare the given item with<br>
the item in the middle (MID_PT) of the list; this tells which half (lower or upper) of the<br>
list contains the Item. Then compare Item with the item in the middle of the correct half<br>
to determine which quarter (lower or upper) of the list contains Item. Continue the<br>
process until finding Item in the list. This process can be termed as narrowing search<br>
scope by half on recursive basis.<br>
With reference to T, the location of an Item is searched as: (i) if value of Item is<br>
less than the value of a node N, proceed to the left child of N; (ii) if value of Item is<br>
greater than the value of a node N, proceed to the right child of N. This process<br>
continues till Item matches with a node of T.<br>
ALGORITHM FOR IBS: The algorithm searches n items (Qb) through a binary<br>
search tree of 2q nodes. The complete algorithm consists of three phases. Each phase<br>
has some steps to run through. Phase-1 (abbreviated as P1) will run first independently<br>
to other mo phases. After completion of Phase-1, Phase-2 (abbreviated as P2) runs in<br>
conjunction with Phase-3 (abbreviated as P3). P2 will call P3, if at any test point it is<br>
found that there is (are) item(s) with value(s) less than the value of that test point. PI<br>
and ?i are binary search itself and continuously narrow down search scope. P2 widens<br>
search scope. P1 and P3 narrow down scope on looking at the middle point (MID_PT)<br>
of the present scope. P2 widens scope, on looking at the upper limit of upper half of<br>
present scope, or else looking at the upper limit of the lower half of the parent scope of<br>
present scope. At each test point the value of the node (AD) is compared with the values<br>
of items (A,: x = 0, 1, 2, ..., n-1) and corresponding to each item a set of four flags are<br>
set that are:<br>
Lx: will be set for Ay &gt; AD - ε: (limit ε → 0) where ε is noise margin that may be<br>
incorporated during data sharing through the communication link. Lx ascertains that Ax<br>
is greater than lower limit of AD.<br>
Px: will be set for A, 
change over point (628) and no other Pv is set. Once set Px will remain set till search of item<br>
x completes. For ε=0, Px will be set for A,<ad.></ad.><br>
Hx: will be set for Ax &gt; An + ε (limit ε → 0). This flag is required only during P2 to look<br>
for higher valued test point. For ε=0, H,=LV For ε ≠ 0, the condition (all L=1) may not<br>
conform that all remaining items in 'to be searched item list' have values greater than<br>
current test point. But this is conformed by the condition (all Hx=l).<br>
Fx: will be set for A,&gt; + ε &gt; AD &gt; AD - ε (limit ε → 0) and indicates completion of search<br>
for item x. Once set, it will remain set till end of total search, and will disable Lx, Px and Hv<br>
to affect search process, i.e. the item, for which search is completed, will be kept out from<br>
the list of to he searched items, ff no other condition prevents, flags will be affected, as soon<br>
as AD is changed. Here to mention that, AD will be active after first execution of step 12<br>
(616).<br>
Steps To Run Through: PHASE I (PI): |Through T, PI proceeds with binary search<br>
theorem to search out least valued item in 'to be searched items list' that contains items<br>
with reset Fv Hags. The least valued item will be identified with Lx flag. At any test point<br>
(or else at any test node of I), if all Lx flags are found set, it is concluded that all items in<br>
'to be searched item list' have values greater than the value of test point. If all L,s are set,<br>
search proceeds to the right half of the test point (or else to the right child of the test<br>
node). If one or more Lx is (are) reset, search moves to the left half of the test point (or else<br>
to the left child of the test node). P1 ends on reaching a leaf of T.<br>
step II: set X = 2q-1 , b = (q-1) (Start of approximation. X is a temporary variable, 'b' is<br>
for tracking power of 2 in X, as if X were a binary register.].<br>
step 12: set AD = AD + X and XA[b] = 1 [Initially AD = 0. As AD is changed the L, P, H<br>
and F flags of the items will be affected immediately. XA|| is a vector of 0 to (q-1) elements<br>
and used to track the bits of AD, as if AD were a binary register. If AD and X are binary<br>
registers, addition operation changes to Boolean exclusive-or operation i.e. AD=AD XOR<br>
X.|<br>
step 12.1: check AD; [check AD is creation of a trial point that compares value of the<br>
present node of T with that of remaining items in 'to be searched item list'. This will set L,<br>
H and F flags as per available conditions|<br>
step 13: if ((any Lx=0), set AD = AD - X and XA[b) = 0; [AD=AD-X implies resetting the<br>
bits of AD as pointed by b, as if AD were a binary register. If AD and X are binary registers,<br>
subtraction operation changes to Boolean exclusive-or operation i.e. AD=AD XOR X.|<br>
step 13.1: if ((any Lx=0) AND (X=l)), check AD; |This is for generation of trial point to<br>
compare the node with value 0 just at end of phase-1. This step may be replaced on<br>
assigning value '0' to item(s) whose L flags is (are) reset and simultaneously setting<br>
corresponding F flag(s). AND signifies Boolean AND operation.)<br><br>
step 14: if X ≠ 1, set X = X / 2, b = b-1 and go to step 12. [X=l implies completion of<br>
search as per binary search theorem, or else ending at a leaf of binary search tree. If X is a<br>
binary register, division by 2 is achieved on shifting X right by l-bit.|<br>
End of phase-1.<br>
PHASE II (P2): [P2 starts from the leaf of the binary search tree where P1 has ended,<br>
and searches for items fhat are in higher order nodes or leaves of the binary search tree.<br>
P2 runs either independently or in conjunction with phase-3 (P3). P2 runs independent to<br>
P3, if no P flag is set. In binary search each test point is the middle of the sorted list - to<br>
be searched through. If value of item to be searched is less than middle point, we go to the<br>
lower half. If value of the item is higher than the test point, we go to the upper half. From<br>
any point of lower or upper half, P2 always shifts the test point to the upper limit of the<br>
upper half. This upper limit is also the upper limit of the sorted list. Now take this sorted<br>
list as lower half of a parent list (sorted). Recursively this upper limit becomes upper limit<br>
of the lower half the parent list. So in next sequence P2 will shift test point to the upper<br>
limit of the parent list. This sequencing will continue till either all Fs are set i.e. search for<br>
all items completes or one or more Px is (are) set. As soon as any Px is set, P2 runs in<br>
conjunction with P3. In this case P2 and P3 start searching through the upper half of the<br>
parent list-scope of P2P3 combination. Similar to binary search P3 narrows down scope<br>
recursively on looking middle of the scope. P2 and P3 combination search in the upper<br>
half. After P2 and P3 combination completes search in the upper half, upper half becomes<br>
lower half and the test point shifts recursively to the upper limit of the parent list. This<br>
upper limit is also the upper limit of upper half of the parent list. Now if there is any item<br>
comes with a value less than this upper limit, P2 and P3 combine search runs in this upper<br>
half. If no such item comes, P2 runs independent to P3 and shifts test point to upper limit<br>
of next parent list.]<br>
step 21: if XA|b| = 0, set A,, = AD + X, XA|b| = 1.<br>
else	jump to step-25.1 [If AD and X are binary registers, addition operation changes<br>
to Boolean or operation i.e. AD=AD OR X and preceding 'if-else' conditional statement<br>
along with jump statement will no longer be in use.]<br>
step 21.1: check AD; [This checking of trial point will take place if AD is changed<br>
following conditional statement 'if XA|b|=0' in stcp-21.]<br>
step 22: if ((ADC &gt; AD) AND (all Pk = 0)), set X=XC, AD=ADC, b=bc, XA=XAC [Return to<br>
change over point (COP). ADC, XC, be and XAC are temporary variables for recording<br>
COP. COP is the point from where a jump to phase-3 will be done and earlier of which<br>
there is no COP for which return to COP is yet pending (for such pending case there will<br>
be no generation of COP though jump to phase-3 is allowed)]<br><br>
step 22.1: check AD; [This step will be executed only if there is return from COP and<br>
after execution of step-22 (625).]<br>
step 23: if ((any L=0) AND (all P=0)), set XC=2*X, ADC=AD, bc=b+l, XAC=XA<br>
[Recording and generation of COP. Just after recording if XAC[bc]=0, set ADC = AD( +<br>
XC and XAC |bc| = 1. If XC and ADC are binary registers set ADC = ADC XOR XC This is<br>
for starting approximation beyond COP after return to COP. The condition 'if ((any<br>
Lx=0) AND (all Px=0))' also sets Px flags if corresponding Lk=0.|<br>
step 24: if (any Lv=0), jump to phase III. [The condition 'if ((any Lx=0) AND (all P,=0))'<br>
generates COP and sets Px flags if corresponding L=0.|<br>
step 25: if (all H≠l), go to step 26.<br>
step 25.1: set X = 2 * X, b=b+l. [If X is considered as a binary register, multiplication by<br>
2 is achieved on shifting X left by 1-bit.|<br>
step 26: go to step 21 [End of phase-2.|<br>
PHASE III (P3): [Only during entry to phase-3 the Px flag(s) can be set if no other I\ is<br>
set. Once a Px is set it will not be reset.)<br>
step 31.1: if (all Px=0), jump to step-22 of phase-II; [This is required for continuation of<br>

Encoder (ENC): ENC encodes the locus of the search path generated by the IBS to<br>
search n Qbs in the binary search tree formed with the first 28k natural numbers. ADM<br>
outputs the serial bit stream that provides the locus of the search path and position<br>
information (POS) of n Qbs in that search path. The encoding and consequent outputting<br>
of the encoded bits along with POS is a method similar to the adaptive delta modulation.<br>
To delta modulate the locus of the search path of n Qbs in the binary search tree T<br>
using IBS, following points are to be considered.<br>
1. Each of n Qbs is assigned with a number in the range 0 to (n-1) to track the grouping<br>
sequence of nk bytes into n Qbs each of k bytes, e.g. 1st group is assigned with 0, 2nd group<br><br>
is assigned with 1 and so on. Call these numbers as POS and a POS needs log2n bits to<br>
represent a number.<br>
2. In the process of IBS (through binary search tree of 28k nodes) when there is a match<br>
(i.e. for which flag Fk is set) the corresponding POS is to be transmitted instead of 8k bits.<br>
3. During any phase of IBS, if value of AD matches with that of any one or more Qbs,<br>
following sequence of bits will be transmitted.<br>
M1 = 0 indicates 1 item match and will be followed with bits of corresponding POS.<br>
M1=l indicates more than I item match i.e. Qbs of equal value and will be followed with<br>
bit M2.<br>
M2=0 indicates number of Qb in match is less than 16 and will be followed by a nibble<br>
that will give the number of Qbs ; that again will be followed by the POS of Qbs for which<br>
match is successful.<br>
M2=1 indicates number of Qbs in match is more than 15 and will be followed by a<br>
group of login bits to mark the number; that again will be followed by the POS of Qbs for<br>
whose match is successful.<br>
4. During phase-1 of IBS foe no match case 2 bits are to be transmitted corresponding<br>
to one sequencing from step 12 through step 14 that are:<br>
P10 = 0 if step 13 sets XA|b| = 0. |refer (618) (619)|<br>
P10 = 1 if step 13 leaves XA|b| = 1.<br>
P11 = 0 for no successful match<br>
P11 =1 for successful match and will be followed with the match as indicated above in<br>
point#3 (644).<br>
5. During phase-2 of IBS for no match case 3 bits are to be transmitted corresponding<br>
to the sequencing from step21 through step 26:<br>
P20 = 0 if step 24 does not allow jump.<br>
P20 = 1 if step 24 allows jump.<br>
P21 = 0 for no successful match<br>
P21 =1 for successful match and will be followed with the match as indicated above in<br>
point#3 (644).<br>
P22 = 1 if step 23 records COP and P20=l [generation of COP must be followed by<br>
jump to phase-3).<br>
P22 = 1 if step 22 returns to COP (once a COP is generated, till its return another COP<br>
can not be generated]. If preceded by P20=l, it will be implied that there is generation of<br>
another COP just after return from one COP.<br>
P22 = 0 before return to COP as in step 22.<br>
P22 = invalid after return from COP till generation of another COP. Validity starts<br>
after P20 =1 followed bv P22=1.<br><br>
6. During phase-3 of IBS for no match case 2 bits are to be transmitted corresponding<br>
to one sequencing from step 31 through step34 that are:<br>
P30 = 0 if step 32 sets XA|b| = 0.<br>
P30 = 1 if step 33 leaves XA|b| = I.<br>
P31 = 0 for no successful match [there will be P, = 1|<br>
P31 =1 for successful match and will be followed with the match as indicated above in<br>
point#3 (644).<br>
P32 [for returning from phase-3|= invalid if P31= 0 [return from phase-3 is possible on<br>
either of two causes - (i) X=l i.e. b=0, (ii) no Pk = 1 (no more phase-3 sequencing is<br>
required and return to COP)).<br>
P32 = 0 if P31 = l and all Px = 0 |return to phase-2|.<br>
P32 = 1 if P31 = l and any Px = 1 |no return to phase-2|.<br>
Communication Link: The communication link is any serial digital data storage, data<br>
transmitter, and data carriers. It carries on the encoded bits to the receiver that consists of<br>
proxy IBS and dequantizer (DQZ). The possibility of mixing of noise during this<br>
communication process is incorporated with the noise margin e used in the IBS.<br>
Proxy IBS: It mimics the locus of search path generated by IBS. It uses encoded<br>
information to identify Qb. It decodes the code generated by the ENC and<br>
correspondingly identifies Qbs. It is a reverse process of ENC and IBS to identify Qb. It<br>
reads the serial bit stream that ADM outputs, identifies P10, P11, P20, P21, P22, P30, P31,<br>
P32, Ml, M2, and POS, run through T as per these bits, identifies matches, assign matches<br>
with corresponding POS and sends this to the DQZ.<br>
Dequantizer (DQZ): DQZ receives decoded Qb along with their POS and serializes<br>
bytes as per table-1 and table-2 to reconstruct the original binary file. For high-level<br>
realization of this encoding scheme DQZ uses Successive Analog Approximation (SAA).<br>
Successive Analog Approximation (SAA): SAA using approximation separates out<br>
bytes from Qb. With reference to equation (1) and (2) [refer (604)] and setting A=B=1,<br>
each byte is a source of quantum given by (VXy*28y) where Vx0 can take any one of values<br>
from 0 to 255 and for y≠ 0, Vxy can take any one of values from 1 to 255. This is because<br>
for bytes other than lowest significant quantum the state for count 0 is discarded. Now<br>
following procedure will separate out each byte on the consideration that minimum value<br>
of a quantum of byte (Vxy*28y) is 28y when Vv=l.<br>
Procedure for separating bytes from Qb:<br><br><br>
Calculation Of The Efficiency:<br>
Total bytes = nk:<br>
Total Qb = n;<br>
Bits per POS = log2n; (POS gives the position information of a Qb - x of V,)<br>
Total trials for n Qbs = pn; (p is average trials per Qb used by IBS to search)<br>
Total bits required to encode nk bytes = nlog2n + 3pn; (where 3 bits per trial are<br>
assigned for adaptive delta modulation as worst case)<br>
Considerations for selection of 3 bits per trial as worst case:<br>
ENC will generate<br>
1&gt; 2 bits P10 and P11 during phase1.<br>
2&gt; 2 bits P20, and P21 during phase2 before generation of and after return from<br>
COP.<br>
3&gt; 3 bits P20, P21 and P22 during phase2 after generation of and before return<br>
from COP.<br>
4&gt; 2 bits P30, and P31 during phase3 if P31=0.<br>
5&gt; 3 bits P30, P31and P32 during phase3 iJP31=l.<br>
6&gt; 1 bit M1 for single match case.<br>
7&gt; 2 bits M1 and M2 for multiple match case.<br>
Compression Efficiency (CR) = (Total bits required to encode 'nk' bytes) / (Total bits of<br>
input file)<br>
= (nlog2n+3pn) / (8nk) = (1/8k) * (log2n+3p);<br>
For CR

7. Scope and/or ambit of the invention<br>
The invention relates to an encryption and decryption method having a<br>
microarchitecture microprogrammed with adaptive delta modulation (ADM) procedure that<br>
modulates the locus of the search path to search all Quantized Bytes with the interlaced binary<br>
search algorithm to store and transmit an equivalent binary code using lesser number of serial<br>
bits' stream than that of the source binary file.<br>
The invention groups the '8nk' bits of any binary file containing 'nk' bytes in total, into 'n'<br>
groups of '8k' bits each. Each of these 'n' groups is termed as Quantized Bytes (Qb). The<br>
numbers corresponding to these n groups occupy into the binary search tree formed by first 28k<br>
natural numbers ranging from 0 to (28k-l). Interlaced Binary Search Algorithm searches the 'n'<br>
Qb in this binary search tree in a single run. The locus of the search path so generated is<br>
adaptive delta modulated to store and transmit. The compression ratio (CR) that is the ratio of<br>
the number of bits after ADM to that of the original binary file comes in worst case as |(log2n<br>
+3p)/k| where p is the average number of trials per 'Qb' in the locus of the search path<br>
generated by the IBS algorithm.<br>
Although the invention has been described with reference to specific embodiments, this<br>
description is not meant to be construed in a limiting sense. Various modifications of the<br>
disclosed embodiments, as well as alternate embodiments of the invention, will become apparent<br>
to persons skilled in the art upon reference to the description of the invention. It is therefore<br>
contemplated that such modifications can be made without departing from the spirit or scope of<br>
the present invention as defined.<br><br>
