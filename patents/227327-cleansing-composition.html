				<td>Description<br>
CLEANSING COMPOSITION<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a cleansing composition to be used for the<br>
body.<br>
Background Art<br>
Alkyl sulfonates, alkyl ether sulfonates, higher fatty acid salts and the like<br>
have been used as surface active agents for cleansing compositions. However,<br>
milder raw materials have been desired since conventional surface active agents have<br>
had a problem in the irritation to hand skin. In recent years, amino acid-based<br>
surface active agents such as N-acyl glutamates have attracted attention as a surface<br>
active agent which is mild to hand skin and high in safety, and has good<br>
biodegradability.<br>
However, N-acyl glutamates exhibit weak foaming and often provide slimy<br>
and greasy feelings after rinsing. In addition, although alkaline cleansing<br>
compositions containing higher fatty acid salts as a main component provide a<br>
refreshed feeling, there was a problem in the feeling upon use like a stretched feeling<br>
of the skin after use thereof.<br>
In order to solve these problems, Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2-268114<br>
(Patent Document 1) has attempted to improve sliminess and foaming by defining a<br>
neutralized salt of an N-acyl aspartic acid, but as a result of the study by the present<br>
inventors, it has been found that both a refreshed feeling thereof and improvement of<br>
a stretched feeling after use thereof are still not satisfactory. Japanese Patent<br>
Laid-Open No. 10-121091 (Patent Document 2) discloses a cleansing composition<br><br>
containing an N-long-chain-acyl dipeptide salt in which the dipeptide moiety is<br>
composed of acidic amino acids and an N-long-chain-acyl acidic amino acid salt, and<br>
discloses that the cleansing composition is non-irritating, has a high resistance to<br>
hard water and provides a pleasant feeling upon use. However, there is no<br>
description on a refreshed feeling, and as a result of the study by the present<br>
inventors, it has been found that the refreshed feeling is not satisfactory and foaming<br>
is also not yet satisfactory. Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2003-183152 (Patent<br>
Document 3) discloses a creamy skin cleansing composition containing an N-acyl<br>
acidic amino acid salt, a sulfosuccinic acid surface active agent, a higher fatty acid<br>
salt and polyethylene glycol, and discloses that the composition is excellent in<br>
foaming and the quality of the foam as well as excellent in a feeling upon use.<br>
However, it has been found that a refreshed feeling thereof and foaming are not yet<br>
satisfactory. Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2003-171687 (Patent Document 4)<br>
discloses a cleansing composition containing N-acylglutamic acid and a salt thereof,<br>
N-acyldiglutamic acid and a salt thereof and a free fatty acid and a salt thereof,<br>
wherein all components have a common acyl group or an alkylcarbonyl group, and<br>
discloses that the composition is excellent in low-temperature stability and cream<br>
shape retention. However, it has been found that a refreshed feeling and foaming<br>
thereof are not satisfactory and it exhibits a slimy feeling after use.<br>
In addition, Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2-268113 (Patent Document 5)<br>
reports that a cleansing agent using N-acyl-aspartic acid or a salt thereof as a base<br>
material among amino acid-based surface active agents has a performance advantage<br>
over those using an N-acyl glutamates because the former provides better foaming<br>
power, more refreshed feeling and better rinsing effect than the latter. However, as<br>
a result of the study by the present inventors, it has been found that when this<br>
cleansing agent is stored at 25Â°C for a long period of time, there arises a problem of<br>
performance-reduction such as reduction of foaming power, reduction of cleansing<br><br>
power, disappearance of a refresh feeling and increase of a stretched feeling after<br>
cleansing.<br>
In order to solve these problems, Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 4-364112<br>
(Patent Document 6) discloses an aqueous liquid cleansing composition containing<br>
an N-(2-hydroxyalkyl)acidicamino acid. However, it describes nothing about a<br>
refreshed feeling, and as a result of the study by the present inventors, it has been<br>
found that the composition provides no refreshed feeling and exhibits a strong<br>
stretched feeling of skin after use. Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 5-070794<br>
(Patent Document 7) attempts to improve storage stability of a triethanolamine salt<br>
solution of N-acyl-aspartic acid by defining its pH. However, as a result of the<br>
study by the present inventors, it has been found that there is no effect on<br>
improvement in storage stability and the solution exhibits a strong stretched feeling<br>
of the skin after use. Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 4-180999 (Patent Document<br>
8) attempts to improve storage stability of a composition by defining the molar ratio<br>
of N-acyl-aspartic acid to ethanolamine. However, as a result of the study by the<br>
present inventors, it has been found that the composition exhibits poor foaming and<br>
does not exhibit a satisfactory refreshed feeling.<br>
In the case of using an N-long-chain-acylamino acid salt, in particular sodium<br>
salt or potassium salt, insolubles have often precipitated when an aqueous solution of<br>
the N-long-chain-acylamino acid salt is stored at a low temperature. In addition,<br>
when an N-long-chain-acylamino acid salt and its aqueous solution are stored at a<br>
high temperature, the N-long-chain-acylamino acid salt and its aqueous solution have<br>
often discolored to yellow. Therefore, there have been problems in that they need<br>
extra work of redissolution or filtration when they are formulated into a final product,<br>
or the final product discolors to yellow. Thus, an N-long-chain-acyl amino acid salt<br>
and its aqueous solution excellent in low and high temperature stability have been<br>
demanded.<br><br>
In order to improve low-temperature stability, for example, Japanese Patent<br>
Laid-Open No. 2001-131129 (Patent Document 9) discloses the improvement of<br>
low-temperature stability by combining an N-long-chain-acylamino acid salt with a<br>
hydrophilic substance having 12 or more carbon atoms. However, as a result of the<br>
study by the present inventors, it has been found that although improvement of<br>
low-temperature stability is significant, high-temperature stability is not satisfactory,<br>
because the composition has exhibited yellowing in the evaluation of stability thereof<br>
at 50Â°C for about one month. Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 9-78085 (Patent<br>
Document 10) attempts to improve high-temperature stability by combining a<br>
glycine derivative with a metal chelating agent and an antioxidant. However, as a<br>
result of the study by the present inventors, it has been found that insolubles<br>
precipitate at 0Â°C, showing unsatisfactory low-temperature stability.<br>

Disclosure of the Invention<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a cleansing composition<br>
which has creamy foams, is excellent in foaming and exhibits excellent cleansing<br><br>
power; which is excellent in the feeling upon use in that it provides a refreshed<br>
feeling after rinsing and provides no stretched feeling of the skin after cleansing; and<br>
in which it can be stored for a long period of time under an acidic condition at 25Â°C<br>
and when the pH is returned to weakly acidic after the long storage, all of the<br>
above-described performance are reproduced, particularly exhibiting a high foaming<br>
power property that is the same as that of the composition before the long storage,<br>
and to provide a cleansing composition which does not form precipitates at a low<br>
temperature in a state of an aqueous solution, and which is resistant to yellowing at a<br>
high temperature in a state of an aqueous solution and in a solid state.<br>
As a result of extensive study to solve the above problems, the present<br>
inventors have discovered that a cleansing composition in which the above problems<br>
are solved can be obtained by combining N-acyl-aspartic acid or a salt thereof and<br>
N-acyl-diaspartic acid or a salt thereof, which have the same molecular structure of<br>
the alkyl group for the N-acyl group with a higher fatty acid or a salt thereof which<br>
has the same alkyl group as that of the above described N-acyl group. The finding<br>

Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
The present invention will be specifically described below.<br>
Component (A) in the cleansing composition of the present invention is<br>
N-acyl-aspartic acid or a salt thereof represented by the above formula (1), wherein<br><br>
optical activity of the amino acid moiety thereof may be L-furm, D-form or<br>
DL-form.<br>
Component (B) in the cleansing composition of the present invention is<br>
N-acyl-diaspartic acid or a salt thereof represented by the above formula (2) or (3),<br>
wherein optical activity of the amino acid moiety thereof may be L-form, D-form or<br>
DL-form. The mass ratio of the N-acyl-diaspartic acid or a salt thereof represented<br>
by formula (2) to the N-acyl-diaspartic acid or a salt thereof represented by formula<br>
(3) in component (B) is not particularly limited, but preferably both types of the<br>
N-acyl-diaspartic acids or salts thereof are present, more preferably the mass ratio is<br>
1:3 to 3:1, in which the composition exhibits the highest foaming power. The<br>
amount of component (B) in the cleansing composition is not particularly limited, but<br>
it is preferably 0.1 to 15% by mass based on the total amount of components (A) and<br>
(B). When the amount is less than 0.1% by mass, a refreshed feeling after cleansing<br>
cannot be sufficiently obtained depending on an additive contained in the<br>
composition. When the amount is higher than 15% by mass, foaming may be<br>
reduced depending on an additive contained in the composition, resulting in<br>
disadvantage in terms of cost such as raw material cost. The amount of component<br>
(B) in the cleansing composition is more preferably 0.1 to 8% by mass.<br>
Component (C) in the cleansing composition of the present invention is a<br>
higher fatty acid or a salt thereof represented by formula (4). Examples of<br>
component (C) include higher fatty acids such as caprylic acid, capric acid, lauric<br>
acid, myristic acid, palmitic acid, stearic acid, isostearic acid, arachic acid, behenic<br>
acid, undecylenic acid, palmitoleic acid, oleic acid, linoleic acid, Iinolenic acid,<br>
oxystearic acid, recinoleic acid, lanolin fatty acid, coconut oil fatty acid, castor oil<br>
fatty acid, olive oil fatty acid, palm oil fatty acid and palm kernel oil fatty acid, and<br>
salts thereof including sodium salts, potassium salts, lithium salts, magnesium salts,<br>
calcium salts, ammonium salts, alkylammonium salts, monoethanolamine salts,<br><br>
diethanolamine sails, tricthanolamine salts, aminomethyl propanol salts, lysine salts.<br>
arginine salts and the like. It is also possible to independently formulate a higher<br>
fatty acid and a base instead of formulating a salt, resulting in formation of a salt in<br>
the system. The higher fatty acid or a salt thereof may be used singly or in<br>
combination of two or more. The amount of component (C) in the composition is<br>
not particularly limited, but it is preferably 0.1 to 15% by mass based on the total<br>
amount of components (A) and (C). Depending on an additive contained in the<br>
composition, a refreshed feeling after cleansing cannot be sufficiently obtained when<br>
the amount is less than 0.1% by mass. When the amount is higher than 15% by<br>
mass, foaming may be insufficient and a stretched feeling may develop after<br>
cleansing. The amount of component (C) in the composition is more preferably 0.1<br>
to 10% by mass.<br>
In the present invention, all of the N-acyl groups in components (A) and (B)<br>
and component (C) have the same alkyl group. When any of the alkyl groups in<br>
these three components are not the same, foaming by the cleansing agent may be<br>
reduced and a stretched feeling after cleansing may develop.<br>
The alkyl group contained in the N-acyl group of component (A) preferably<br>
has from 7 to 23 carbon atoms. When it has less than 7 or more than 23 carbon<br>
atoms, a foaming power may be reduced depending on an additive contained in the<br>
composition. The alkyl group preferably has from 9 to 17 carbon atoms, and more<br>
preferably the content of the component (A) in which the alkyl group has 11 carbon<br>
atoms is 50% by mol or more of the total component (A).<br>
The cleansing composition of the present invention can be produced and used<br>
in a relatively wide pH region, but it is preferred that the pH be adjusted in a range of<br>
4.5 to 7.0. Depending on an additive contained in the composition, foaming may be<br>
reduced when the pH is less than 4.5 or higher than 7.0. The pH is more preferably<br>
from 5.0 to 6.5.<br><br>
The cleansing composition of the present invention may comprise one or<br>
more selected from inorganic salts and organic acid alkali metal salts as component<br>
(D). Examples of the inorganic salts include sodium chloride, potassium chloride,<br>
magnesium chloride, sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate, magnesium sulfate, sodium<br>
nitrate and the like. Examples of the organic acid alkali metal salts include the<br>
sodium salt of pyrrolidone carboxylic acid, sodium lactate, sodium citrate, sodium<br>
malate, sodium tartrate, sodium adipate, monosodium glutamatc, sodium aspartate,<br>
sodium maleate, sodium fumarate, sodium acetate, sodium glycolate and the like.<br>
The amount of component (D) in the composition is preferably 0.01 to 50% by mass<br>
based on component (A). Depending on an additive contained in the composition,<br>
storage stability at 25Â°C may be impaired when the amount is less than 0.01 % by<br>
mass. When the amount is 50% by mass or more, foaming may be insufficient.<br>
The amount of component (D) in the composition is more preferably 0.01 to 30% by<br>
mass.<br>
The cleansing composition of the present invention is preferably a<br>
composition in which after the composition is stored at 50Â°C for 30 days, the<br>
reduction in foaming power thereof is 20% or less. An example of the cleansing<br>
composition of the present invention may include a composition prepared by using<br>
component (A) treated under a specific condition as a raw material. That is, the<br>
N-acyl-aspartic acid salt is first treated with sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide,<br>
ammonia, magnesium hydroxide, monoethanolamine, diethanolamine,<br>
triethanolamine or the like preferably to a pH of 6.0 or higher, more preferably to a<br>
pH of 7.0 or higher. Then, the resulting mixture is treated with hydrochloric acid,<br>
sulfuric acid, nitric acid, acetic acid, citric acid or the like to a final pH of from 4.5 to<br>
6.0. During the treatment, the difference between the highest pH and the final pH is<br>
controlled to be 0.5 or more. The N-acyl-aspartic acid or a salt thereof subjected to<br>
the above-described treatment can be used as component (A). In this production<br><br>
example, when pH is not increased to 6.0 or higher, the reduction in foaming power<br>
after the composition is stored at 50Â°C for 30 days may not be 20% or less. When<br>
pH is not adjusted to the range between 4.5 and 6.0 during the reduction of pH,<br>
foaming may be insufficient. Moreover, when the difference between the highest<br>
pH and the final pH is less than 0.5, the cleansing agent may not provide sufficient<br>
storage stability.<br>
As described herein the term "foaming power" refers to a measured value<br>
obtained by measuring 300 g of a liquid sample having a concentration of 0.33% by<br>
the Osterizer method. When it is mentioned that after the composition is stored at<br>
50Â°C for 30 days the reduction in foaming power thereof is 20% or less, the<br>
reduction in the measured value is 20% or less.<br>
The cleansing composition of the present invention is preferably a<br>
composition in which after it is stored at 50Â°C for 30 days, the increase in the content<br>
of a free fatty acid based on component (A) is 15% by mass or less<br>
Here, the free fatty acid is a product formed by the hydrolysis of component<br>
(A). For example, when component (A) is sodium lauroyl aspartate, the free fatty<br>
acid formed by the hydrolysis of component (A) is lauric acid.<br>
Generally, a cleansing composition containing component (A) has a tendency<br>
that hydrolysis of component (A) proceeds when the composition is stored for a long<br>
period of time in a heated state, leading to increase in the content of a free fatty acid.<br>
When the increase in the content can be suppressed to 15% by weight or less relative<br>
to component (A), the composition preferably provides excellent foaming. The<br>
content is more preferably suppressed to 10% by weight or less, most preferably to<br>
8% by weight or less.<br>
An example of a method for suppressing the increase in the content of a free<br>
fatty acid to 15% by weight or less relative to component (A) includes preparing the<br>
cleansing composition of the present invention by using component (A) treated under<br><br>
a specific condition as a raw material. That is, an aqueous solution of the<br>
N-acyl-aspartic acid salt is first treated with sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide,<br>
ammonia, magnesium hydroxide, monoelhanolamine, diethanolamine,<br>
triethanolamine or the like to a pH of 6.0 or higher, preferably to a pH of 7.0 or<br>
higher. Then, the resulting mixture is treated with hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid,<br>
nitric acid, acetic acid, citric acid or the like to a final pH of from 4.5 to 6.0. During<br>
the treatment, the difference between the highest pH and the final pH is controlled to<br>
be 0.5 or more. The N-acyl-aspartic acid salt subjected to the above-described<br>
treatment can be used as component (A).<br>
Moreover, when the cleansing composition of the present invention is stored<br>
in a liquid form, the pH thereof is preferably higher than 6.5 and is preferably 10 or<br>
less. When the pH is 6.5 or less, the reduction in foaming power after the<br>
composition is stored at 50Â°C for 30 days is larger than 10%. When the pH is<br>
higher than 10, the reduction in foaming power after the composition is stored at<br>
50Â°C for 30 days is small, but significant yellowing of the liquid is apparent. In<br>
particular, when the pH is in the range of 7.0 to 9.0, the reduction in foaming power<br>
after the composition is stored at 50Â°C for 30 days is smaller and the yellowing<br>
hardly occurs, which is more preferable. As described herein the term "yellowing"<br>
refers to a value measured as the degree of reduction in visible-light transmittance at<br>
a wavelength of 430 nm by using a spectrophotometer.<br>
Phosphorus in the present invention includes phosphorus compounds,<br>
including organic phosphorus, such as phosphoric acid and phosphorous acid,<br>
sodium phosphate, polyphosphates, metaphosphates, lecithins, phytic acid or salts<br>
thereof, alkyl phosphates and salts thereof such as magnesium ascorbyl phosphate,<br>
ascorbyl phosphates, sodium lauryl phosphate, sodium myristyl phosphate and<br>
sodium coconut oil fatty acid phosphate, alkyl phosphate triethanolamine ethers such<br>
as myristyl phosphate triethanolamine ether, polyoxyethylene alkyl ether phosphoric<br><br>
acids and salts thereof such as sodium polyoxycthylene lauryl ether phosphate,<br>
sodium polyoxyethylenc cetyl ether phosphate and sodium polyoxyethylene oleyl<br>
ether phosphate, and phosphonic acid. The content of phosphorus is not<br>
particularly limited, and may be of any concentration in the range of from 0.005 to<br>
0.3% by mass. When the content of phosphorus is less than 0.005% by mass, the<br>
composition may be discolored yellow during the storage thereof at high<br>
temperatures. When the content of phosphorus is higher than 0.3% by mass, the<br>
composition may be cloudy or may precipitate at low temperatures. The content of<br>
phosphorus is more preferably from 0.005 to 0.08% by mass, most preferably from<br>
0.05 to 0.08% by mass.<br>
The content of organic phosphorus in the present invention is not particularly<br>
limited, and may be of any concentration in the range of from 0.005 to 0.08% by<br>
mass. Preferably, it is from 0.005 to 0.05% by mass. When the content of organic<br>
phosphorus is less man 0.005% by mass, the composition may be discolored yellow<br>
during the storage thereof at high temperatures. When the content of phosphorus is<br>
higher than 0.08% by mass, the composition may be cloudy or may precipitate at low<br>
temperatures. The content of organic phosphorus is more preferably from 0.01 to<br>
0.05% by mass. As described herein the term "content of organic phosphorus"<br>
refers to the content of phosphorus contained in the soluble fraction in diethyl ether<br>
when the cleansing composition is fractionated by adding it into a mixture of diethyl<br>
ether/distilled water under an acidic condition by sulfuric acid.<br>
The content of the above described phosphorus and organic phosphorus can<br>
be adjusted by using raw materials having a specific content of phosphorus and<br>
controlling temperatures in the step for producing component (A) or (B) of the<br>
present invention.<br>

Examples<br>
Next, the present invention will be described in more detail by Examples, but<br>
technical ranges and embodiments thereof of the present invention are not limited to<br>
Examples. Methods for determining various physical properties of the cleansing<br>
compositions obtained in Examples and Comparative Examples will be described<br>
below.<br><br><determination of foaming power><br>
Into a mixer (trade name: MX-V1000, manufactured by Matsushita Electric<br>
Industrial Co., Ltd.) were charged 3.3 g of a cleansing composition sample and 296.7<br>
g of purified water, and the mixture was agitated at 25Â°C for 30 seconds in the mixer.<br>
Immediately after the agitation, the height (mm) of generated foams was measured.<br>
The foaming power was determined by the height with reference to the following<br>
standards. Higher measured values represent higher foaming power.<br>
Criteria for determining the foaming power (evaluation criteria by points)<br>
7 points: foaming power of 185 mm or higher<br>
6	points: foaming power of 180 mm or higher, less than 185 mm<br>
5	points: foaming power of 175 mm or higher, less than 180 mm<br>
4	points: foaming power of 170 mm or higher, less than 175 mm<br>
3	points: foaming power of 165 mm or higher, less than 170 mm<br>
2	points: foaming power of 160 mm or higher, less than 165 mm<br>
1 point: foaming power of less than 160 mm<br><test for determining the feeling upon use><br>
Cleansing composition samples were used to perform hand cleansing tests on<br>
eight male and female panelists. The feeling upon use was determined for each test<br>
item (foaming, creaminess of foams, refreshed feeling, and stretched feeling) by<br>
calculating the average of evaluation points submitted by the panelists on the basis of<br>
the evaluation criteria by points as described below.<br>
Criteria for determining the feeling upon use (evaluation criteria by points)<br>
7	points: very good<br>
6	points: good<br>
5	points: slightly good<br>
4	points: fair<br>
3	points: slightly bad<br><br>
2 points: bad<br>
1 point: very bad<br><determination of free fatty acid><br>
Free fatty acids contained in cleansing composition samples were<br>
quantitatively determined by the technique of high performance liquid<br>
chromatography under the following measurement conditions.<br>
Measurement conditions<br>
Column: 150 x 6 mm (trade name : YMC-Pack, ODS-AM, manufactured<br>
by YMC Co., Ltd.)<br>
Eluant: methanol: water: 1,4-dioxane : phosphoric acid = 1000 : 200 :<br>
24.5 :0.31<br>
Flow rate: 0.8 ml/min<br>
Detector: R1 detector<br><measurement of visible-light transmittance><br>
Visible-light transmittance at a wavelength of 430 nm of cleansing<br>
composition samples was measured by a predetermined method by means of a<br>
spectrophotometer (trade name: UV-1200, manufactured by Shimadzu Corporation)<br>
while maintaining the liquid temperature of the samples at 50Â°C.<br><determination of phosphorus content><br>
In 50 g of purified water was dissolved 0.1 g of an N-long-chain-acylamino<br>
acid salt, and the mixture was prepared to a concentration of 0.2%. The resulting<br>
mixture was used as a sample to determine the phosphorus content in the sample<br>
using an emission analyzer (trade name: P-4010 type ICP, manufactured by Hitachi,<br>
Ltd.) under the following ICP conditions.<br>
ICP conditions<br>
RF output: 1.0 kw<br>
Plasma gas: 16 L/min<br><br>
Carrier gas: 0.7 L/min<br>
Auxiliary gas: 1.0 L/min<br>
Liquid feed pump: 10 revolutions/min<br><determi nation of organic phosphorus content><br>
The organic phosphorus content was determined by using the P-4010 type<br>
ICP emission analyzer (trade name: manufactured by Hitachi, Ltd.). For preparing<br>
a sample, 0.5 g of an N-long-chain-acylamino acid salt and about 1 mL of an<br>
aqueous 1 mol/L NaOH solution were dissolved in purified water, and the mixture<br>
was adjusted to 100 ml. Into a separatory funnel was taken 50 mL of the resulting<br>
mixture, to which 4 mL of sulfuric acid and 50 mL of diethyl ether were added, and<br>
the mixture was shaken for 2 minutes. The resulting mixture was left standing for 1<br>
hour to separate phases, and then an organic phase was taken out to remove diethyl<br>
ether by a rotary evaporator. The residue was dissolved in 5 mL of an aqueous 1<br>
mol/L NaOH solution, to which distilled water was added to obtain 100 mL of a<br>
mixture, and the resulting mixture was used as a sample. Other than these<br>
operations, quantitative determination was performed under the same conditions and<br>
methods as used for determining the phosphorus content as described above.<br>

To a mixed solution of 860 g (5.55 mol) of monosodium L-aspartate, 2,978 g<br>
of deionized water, 222 g (5.55 mol) of sodium hydroxide, was added 1049 g of an<br>
aqueous t-butanol solution having a concentration of 80% by mass. To the resulting<br>
solution under ice cooling, while it is being adjusted to a pH of 12 with sodium<br><br>
hydroxide having a concentration of 25% by mass. 1,210 g (about 5.2 mol,<br>
phosphorus content of 1.0% by mass, and organic phosphorus content of 0.044% by<br>

added, and agitation was continued for another 30 minutes.<br>
Acid-precipitated phase separation step<br>
Sulfuric acid having a concentration of 75% by mass was added dropwise to<br>
the resulting solution to adjust the pH of the solution to 2 and the temperature of the<br>
solution to 45Â°C. After the completion of the dropping of the sulfuric acid,<br>
agitation was stopped and the solution was left standing for 20 minutes at 45Â°C.<br>
The solution was separated into an organic phase and a water phase, and from these<br>
phases the organic phase was isolated.<br>

t-butanol in a concentration of 20% by mass, and the resulting solution was adjusted<br>
to 45 Â°C and agitated for 20 minutes. After stopping agitation, the solution was left<br>
standing for 20 minutes at 45Â°C, resulting in separation of the solution into an<br>
organic phase and a water phase.<br>
Solvent evaporating step<br>

organic phase so that 83% of the carboxyl group in N-lauroyl-L-aspartic acid in the<br>
organic phase was in the form of salt, and ionized water was added to the resulting<br>
solution so that the solution had a solid content of 30% by mass, followed by mixing<br>
by agitation.<br>
Then, the solution was subjected to vacuum distillation using a 10-L glass<br>
vessel under a pressure of 300 mmHg while adding deionized water so that the solid<br><br>
content of 30% by mass was maintained during the distillation. After 11 hours from<br>
the start of the distillation, the solution temperature reached 70Â°C and the distillation<br>
was stopped, obtaining an aqueous solution of sodium N-lauroyl-L-aspartate. The<br>
aqueous solution had a solid content of 30% by mass, and as a result of<br>
dctennination by the above described methods of determination, it was found that the<br>
aqueous solution had a phosphorus content of 0.059% and an organic phosphorus<br>
content of 0.033%, based on the solid content.<br>
