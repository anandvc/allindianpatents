Palatable ductile chewable veterinary composition<br>
The present invention relates to an easy-to-use. safe, efficacious, and stable veterinary formulation consisting of a highly palatable ductile chewable veterinary composition comprising an effective amount of one or more ingredients that are active against animal pests, pathogens or animal diseases; of meat flavoring; of partially gelatinized starch; of a softener; and of up to 9% of water. The present invention also relates to a method of contorting said animal pests or pathogens and of curing or preventing said animal diseases by feeding an animal with said highly palatable ductile chewable veterinary composition. Further, ties invention relates to a process for producing said highly palatable ductile viewable veterinary composition by cold extrusion. In a preferred embodiment, the highly palatable ductile chewable veterinary composition controls animal pests like endow-parasites, such as worms, and simultaneously echo-parasites, such as biting insects like fleas, on pets. The pesticidaily effective ingredient is dispensed as the animal chews the product.<br>
Field and background of the invention<br>
Veterinary products can be administered to warm-blooded animals in very different ways depending on their mode of action and their ability to be taken up either by the treated animal or the target pest. Thus veterinary products can be administered, for example, torahs as pour-on or spot-on formulations, in form of shampoos, showers, as a dip. bath or spray, in form of a collar, and in many variants of these application forms. They can also be administered systemically, for example, orally, parent rally and in certain cases even transversally. Examples of systemic administration forms are: via injection, as a tablet, capsule, bolus, drink, feed additive and the like. Each of these administration forms can have advantages-ordisadvantages-depending-onthe-actdal-srtuation-andthe-animal-thatHsi need of such a treatment Treatment of herd animals, like horses, cater, sheep or poultry usually requires different administration methods than for the treatment of single animals, such as pets like dogs and cats.<br>
One very convenient and easy to manage administration form for human patients Is the oral uptake of a medicament. This would also be very desirable in the field of veterinary medicine but here the animal holder or veterinarian is confronted with the natural behavior of the animal and oral treatment can be a real challenge.<br><br>
Many attempts have been made to design the ideal oral application foci that is really accepted and voluntarily taken up by the animal but most of these application forms need still to be improved.<br>
The present inventors recognized that in the field of animal health the dosage form and epically the palatability of the dosage form, i.e. the natural acceptance of the drug plays the decisive role. The underlying problems are outlined hereinafter.<br>
While, in humans, medicaments may be administered in a wide variety of application formic, such as tablets, coated tablets, emulsions, injection solutions, suppositories and the Hoe, because the dispelling and the desire to recover in human patients can be ride upon, in the case of animals practical problems are soon encountered, since a few application forms, such as the usage of suppositories, either have to be dispensed with all together or other forms, such as injections, must only be carried out by the veterinarian.<br>
In general, humans do not like to visit the doctor. The same is true for animal keepers who would need advice from a veterinarian. In general, the animal keeper prefers to use those treatment methods that he can carry out himself without having involved a veterinarian. Among the preferred treatment methods, which an animal keeper can carry out himself, e.g. following the veterinarian's instructions, is the oral administration of medicaments.<br>
Treating humans with medicines is generally not problematic, because the human patient follows the advice of the doctor or reads the directions on the leaflet in the package and complies with them since this is in his own interest, and because the manufacturer usually prepares the tablet, capsule or coated tablet in a form which is appropriate for oral consumption-and- sateen-tailor d for human patient’s<br>
However, as soon as a pharmaceutical active ingredient has a taste which is unpleasant to the animal, whether because it is bitter or has some other unpleasant taste or is simply amen to the animal, the animal refuses to take it orally. This inbox behavior occurs to varying degrees among the different species of animals, and essentially depends on their conventional eating habits. Unfortunately, only a few active ingredients have a neutral taste, so that the problem being discussed here is almost always present.<br><br>
In the case of a human patient, an unpleasant tasting active ingredient can be masked relatively easily, e.g. by coating it with a neutral-tasting or sweet layer. Everybody has come across gelatin capsules or tablets coated with sugar or lacquer at some time or other. It is easy to instruct the human patient to take the preparation without chewing.<br>
An animal must have a natural willingness .to take a medicinal preparation orally, which mar  that the medical preparation must taste well and be palatable. Of course, an individual animal of a few animals can also be forced to take a medicament, by wreaking it swallow or by injecting it. However, such forced methods are not only unacceptable to large animal operations but also to single dogs and cats which tend to bite or scrape if they are not willing to be treated. This is why animal treatment can be very labor-intensive or can require the intervention of a veterinarian and this ultimately leads to increase of costs.<br>
Therefore, for pets but equally for animals that are kept on a large scale, simple and safe oral application forms are required, which can be easily administered by the animal keeper, which lead to reliable results, and which are affordable.<br>
The chewable composition according to the present invention is not only suitable for replacing the treatment with a tablet or capsule. These chewable can also easily be mixed with conventional non-medicated feed pellets If herds of animals have to be treated.<br>
Due to their excellent palatability the chewables according to the present invention are taken up by animals without causing any acceptance problems. Their handling is easy and safe, and can be adapted to the need either of an individual animal like a cat or a dog or to a herd animals like sheep and cows.<br>
When reviewing the administration of capsules and coated tablets to animals, it has been shown that these application funs are rather unsuitable for animal medicine, since in the case of herd animals they can only be used in a controlled manner with considerable effort on a daily basis, and in the case of pets, such as dogs and cats, lead to particular acceptance problems. As already mentioned above, the eating habits of animals generally play a decisive role when using oral application forms. Thus, most important is an attractive taste and the palatability.<br><br>
In the case of dogs, it has been observed that they gnaw at solid food, e.g. on bones, and gulp down other food, either in the form of large scraps or wet formulated food, almost unthawed. If a tablet or coated tablet is mixed with the wet formulated feed, varying results are obtained. In a few cases, the tablet is not noticed by the dog at all and is simply gulped down, and in other cases it remains uneaten in the dog bowl. In contrast to dogs, cats are considerably more fastidious in their eating habits. Only in the rarest cases can a tablet or coated tablet be mixed with the formulated food, without them noticing it immediately and rejecting it. Although cats also to not exactly chew their food, they generally break it down with a few small bites. They thereby damage the protective coating of a tablet or capsule and release the unpleasant tasting active ingredient Attempts to mix the active ingredient fireclay with the feed likewise fail, because either the degree of dilution is insufficient to nurture the unpleasant taste or the active ingredient breaks down too rapidly when in contact with the feed. For the same reasons, mixtures of feed, active ingredient and exponents, which should stimulate the appetite of dogs and cats, similarly do not have a successful outcome with cats. Whereas the test animals rush eagerly to a placebo which has a corresponding appetite stimulant, i.e. a tablet consisting of feed, flavoring and other percipients. but no active ingredient, the test animals reject the same combination as soon as active ingredient is added. Cleared, a different technical solution must be found to the existing problem with animals.<br>
Of course, any other active ingredient which is suitable for animals can be administered according to the present invention, but especially those active ingredients that have the taste disadvantages mentioned initially and are therefore not willingly taken orally by animals.<br>
Basically, a diversity of individual active ingredients or mixtures of active ingredients may be considered, e;g. those-acting-against-exothermal (recto)-or1ntemah(endow)-parasites-erective— ingredients acting against animal diseases including viral or bacterial infections, behavioral disorders, such as hypo- or hyper-activity, inflammatory diseases, and auto-immune diseases. Thus, the active ingredient can be a pesticide or a medicament or a mixture of both.<br>
It should be kept In mind that the present invention deals with an optimized application form for veterinary compositions rather than with the treatment of animals with a specific class of active ingredients. On the contrary, the present invention provides an easy-to-use, safe.<br><br>
powerful, and stable veterinary formulation consisting of a highly palatable ductile chewable veterinary composition, which allows to administer orally almost each and any active ire gradient to a warm-blooded animal, provided that this active ingredient or mixture of active ingredients is at the administered dose physiologically acceptable to the animal, does not display unacceptable side effects and, what is most important, exhibits after oral uptake systemic activity. This means that the main prerequisite for the active ingredient is that after oral administration it is taken up by the body fluids, including blood and lymph, and trarisported to the animal pest, the pathogen or the diseased organ where it can exhibit its activity. Thus, any active ingredient or class of active ingredients mentioned hereinafter is nutlike but a non-limiting example of suitable active ingredients. The application form of tine present invention is actually not limited to existing active ingredients but also suitable for each and any active ingredient developed in the future provided that the future active ingredient meets the main characteristics explained hereinbefore.<br>
The highly palatable ductile chewable veterinary composition of the present invention is in principle a medicated food product and everybody working in this area is aware of the technical problems that arise in context with the production of medicated feed. For example, stability of the active ingredient is very comical. It is a matter of fact that many potent active compounds are somewhat unstable (temperature-sensitive), above all when in contact with feed material, especially close contact to vegetable and animal materials, during conventional expulsion of feed pellets, result in considerable losses of active ingredient.<br>
For example, when feed pellets are prepared via extrusion, the dried organic starting material of animal or vegetable origin is ground, is intimately mixed with the active ingredient, that is to say is substantially homogenized, and then is moistened with water or steam and is -compressedHnto-pellet -  ssures-of-aroundH60i bad  However, said high pressures and the permanent high temperatures in the range of 60-100  are disadvantageous and do not only dramatically reduce the viscosity of the pellets but result in a considerable lost of active ingredient.<br>
Whereas most active ingredients in pure form or in contact with carriers that are routinely used in the production of tablets or capsules withstand such relatively high temperatures per se very well and can be stored in pure form or as tablets or capsules at room temperature for months or years without any measurable loss of active ingredient, they decompose relatively<br><br>
rapidly under pressure and in Intimate contact with animal or vegetable fibers in feedstuff and under the prevailing elevated temperatures. It appears that contact with the fibers actually catalyses the decomposition process. Even when the elevated-pressure and elevated-temperature phase is kept as short as technically possible and the finished pellets are immediately cooled down to room temperature directly after the compression process, a quarter to a third of the active ingredient is nevertheless lost. Even though in the rare cases where the degradation products do not have disadvantageous effects on the animate treated, the unavoidable loss of active ingredient inevitably results in a considerable Crease in the cost of the final product. Thus extrusion processes can lead to very Ltfxiesirable effects.<br>
For the reasons mentioned, therefore, much effort has been directed at stablli2ir&gt;g temperature-sensitive active ingredients so that they withstand the elevated temperatures and pressures during pellet preparation without loss of active substance and also, when in the form of the finished pellets, have a long-term storage stability suitable for practical purposes.<br>
Unsuccessful attempts at such stabilization Include, for example. (1) reduction of the active ingredient surface area by means of compression into granules, a very great variety of granule sizes having been tried; (2) sealing of the said active ingredient granules in a very great variety of protective layers, for example gelatin or various sugars and coatings; (3) enclosure of the active ingredient within porous materials such as, for example, various celluloses, starches, solicit acids or zealot’s, with or without additional protective layers; and (4) chemical modification of the basic macrocodes structure of the active ingredient Although in a few cases chemical modification has resulted in improved stability of the comporting per serit4ias-stnrtt:ritaneotisiy-resdItedHnHoss-of-activity^<br>
However, none of those attempts has resulted In an appreciably smaller loss of active ingredient on compression into feed pellets or in measurably improved storage stat elite.<br>
Moreover, success has now been achieved, surprisingly, in providing the user with the user-friendly, easy-to-use, safe, powerful, stable, and especially highly palatable chewable veterinary composition of the present invention.<br><br>
Astonishingly, it is now possible to provide a product that not only withstands the extrusion process undamaged but also survives for a outstanding long storage period.<br>
Therefore, It is highly surprising and was absolutely unpredictable that even so the chewable veterinary composition of the present invention contains a relatively high amount of meat material, this has obviously when combined with the appropriate amount of partially gelatinized starch, no adverse effect on the stability of the active ingredient. It actually turned out that the chewable veterinary composition "of the present invention is a very stable product that can be stored at room temperature over many months without significant loss or degradation of active ingredient. Tests with stored material demonstrate that the palatability is not decreased and the efficacy of the active ingredient stays at a high level.<br>
Moreover, investigations of the kinetic behavior demonstrate another surprising effect. It could not have been foreseen that the administration of the chewable veterinary composition of the present Invention could lead to absolutely the same level of bioavailability as the administration of tablets or capsules. Thus, the present invention provides a safe, easy to use and stable product that is at least as efficacious as conventional oral application forms. like tablets or capsules.<br>
Many biocides and veterinary medicines that may be now be incorporated Into the chewable veterinary composition and be used according to the present invention, have been known to skilled specialists for a long time but the conventional oral dosage forms are not satisfactory because they are not attractive for animals and show the disadvantages discussed above.<br>
With the chewable veterinary composition of the present invention one can combat all kinds 1^fpafasites7-Exte 1a paras!tes7also- lied-echo-parasites are-understood which normally live on the animal, i.e. an the animal's skin or in the fur. Enclosed are biting insects, such as mosquitoes, blowfly, fleas or lice, or members of the order  Acam7a, e.g. mites or ticks. Suitable products against extremely parasites include insecticides and acaroids. It does not matter what their mode of action actually is. They can be e.g. chitin synthesis inhibitors, growth regulators; juvenile phonons; adulteries. They can be broadband insecticides, broadband acaroids. The active ingredient can be a killer or a deterrent or repellent It can affect e.g. only adult stages or juvenile stages of the parasite or may affect any stage. The only prerequisite is that the active ingredient acts systemically. This<br><br>
means that it is not decomposed after oral uptake but transported by the body fluids to the skin or organ where the parasite uses to live.<br>
If the active ingredient is an scarified one can, for example, select a systemically acting acaroids from one of the following well-known daces of acaroids intruder g: antiskid  acaroids such as abamectin, doramectin, eprinomectin, ivermectin, milbemectin, nikkomycins. selamectin. tetranactin, and thuringiensin; bridged biphenyl acrider such as azobenzene, benzoximate, benzyl benzoate, brbmopropylate, clot snider, chlorfenethd, chlorfenson, chlorfensulphide, chlorobenzilate, chloropropylate, icefall. biphenyl saffron, dofenapyn, fanon, fentrifanil, fiuorbenside, protocol, titration, and tetras; catamite acaroid’s such as binomial, carbanolate, carbaryl, cartxjfuran, fenothiocarb. methkx:arb, metacarpi , primacy, and pronoun; oxides carbonate acaroid’s such as aldicarb. butocarboxim. oxamyl. thiocarboxime, and thiofanox; dinltrophenol carbides such as binapacryl, dinned, diminution, din cap, dinocap-4, dinocap-6, demotion, dinopenton, dinosulfon. dinoterbon, and DNOC; formamidine accuracies such as amrita. chlordimefomi, chloromebuform. formetanate, and formparanate, mite growth regulators such as clofentezine, dofenapyn, fluazuron, flubenzimine, flucycloxuron, flufenoxuron, and hexythiazox; organ chlorine acaroids such as bromocyclen, camphechlor, dienochlor. and endosulfan; organizing accuracies such as azocydotin, cheatings, and fenbutatin oxide; paranoid accuracies such as acetoprole, Prone and analogues and derivatives thereof, tebufenpyrad, and vaniliprole; parathyroid acaroids Induding: pyrethroid ester acariddes Bee acrinathrin, bifenthrin, cyhalothrin, cypermethrin, alpha-cypermethrin, fenpropathrin, fenvalerate, flucythrinate, flumethrin, fluvaJinate, tau-fluvalinate, and permethrin, and pyrethroid ether acaroid’s like hatfenprox; quinoxaline acaroid’s such as chinomethionat and thioqulnox; sulfite ester acaroid’s such as propagated; tectonics acid acariddes such as spirodidofenrand-from-unclassified-acariddes-such acequ'mocylramidoflumetrarsenoas-oxide, chloromethiuron, decanted, crotamlton, diafenthiuron, dichlofluanid, disaffirms, fenazaflor, fenazaquin, fenpyroximate, fluacrypyrim, fluenetil. maculae, MNAF, nifluridide. pyridines, pyrimidifen, sulfiram, sulfluramid, sulfur and triarathene.<br>
Suitable insecticides acting either as adulteries or inset growth regulators (Girls) can be chosen from a variety of well-known different chemical dashes such as chlorinated hydrocariDons, organophosphates, car amates. parathyroid, formalities, borates, phenylpyrazoles, and macrocodes lardoons (previously known as avermectins . Prominent<br><br>
representatives of adulteries/insect killers are imidacloprid, mention, fibroin, allethrin, resection, fenvalerate, perverting, halation and derivatives thereof. Insect autacoids kill the insect in almost any development stage either by contact or as a stomach poison. Widely used representatives of insect growth regulators (Ergs) are, for example benzoytphenylureas such as diflubenzuron, lufenuron, novifiumuron. hexaflumuron, triflumuron, and teflubenzuron or substances like fenoxycarb, pyriproxifen, methoprene, isoprene, hydro Rene, chromatin, buprofezin, pymetrozine and derivatives thereof. Insect growth inhibitors or insect growth regulators (any” of which is commonly known as an IGR) are products or materials that interrupt or inhibit the life cycle of a pest.<br>
It goes without saying that the highly palatable ductile chewable veterinary composition accountings to the present invention is also very suitable for administering active ingredients that combat internal parasites (ends-parasites) such as worms living in the blood or in organs of the animal. Thus, the active ingredient can be an anathematic (deformer).<br>
Anthelmintics (deformers) are a heterogeneous group of drugs but they are selectively toxic to worms. The drugs can achieve this by either inhibiting the metabolic process vital to the parasite, or by causing the parasite to be exposed to higher concentration of drug than are the hosts cells, which means that one makes use of the existence of an advantageous therapeutic window. Anthelmintics can affect the target parasite during treatment by interfering with the integrity of parasite cells, inhibiting neuromuscular transmission and coorcfination, or mechanisms which protect against host immunity, that ultimately lead to the starvation, neuromuscular paralysis, death and expulsion of the parasite. Anthelmintics are commonly administered by drench, paste, orally, or by injection. The drugs are absorbed into the broody stream and widely diffused. They are metabolized in the liver and excreted in feces -and-orange n he-animal-health^feld-antf1elmintics-are-used-widely-iJsed-^gainst-foun^ lungworms, tapeworms, intestinal worms, whipworms, hookworms, pinworms, trichinella (trichinosis), and other less common organisms, liver flukes and other less common organisms in a broad range of animals such as beef, cattle, swine, goats, horses, and pets like cats and dogs.

Internal parasites within the present invention include all species of worm infestation (helminthes) but also bacteria’ and viruses causing bacterialahd viral infections, in patrician those that infest the organs or parts of the body, such as the lungs, heart, carpentry tract or extremities, or which spread through the whole organism.<br>
The anathematic can be selected from endo-parasiticides and undecided including one of the following well-known groups of deformers such as macrocycfic lactones (sometimes called simply macro ides), benzimldazoles, pro-benzimldazoles, imidazothiazoles. tetrahydropyrimidines, organophosphates and piperazines.<br>
A most preferred group of anthelmintics consists of the more modem natural or chemically modified macro cyclic lactones (macro ides), such as avermectins, milbemycins and derivatives thereof, Including prominent representatives such as Ivermectin, Doramectin. Moxidectin, Selamectin, Emamectin, Eprinomectin. Milbemectin, Abamectin, Milbemydn oxide, Nonaddicting. and a derivative thereof, in free form or in the form of a physiologically acceptable salt.<br>
The macro cyclic lactones are most preferred because they exhibit a broad spectrum of activity. Most of them exhibit recto and in parallel endo-parsiticidal activity. Therefore, they caHed"endectoddesrMaa'ocyclic4actones4Dind o-agglutinated-chlorine causing in the first instance paralysis and later on the death of the parasite.<br>

Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
Even so meat flavoring is actually not the main component of the highly palatable ductile chewable veterinary composition it plays the major role for the present invention. It has surprisingly been recognized that the desired high palatability taint is necessary for achieving reliable and well-reproducible results stricter depends on the amount of meat flavoring in Ice final composition. The meat flavoring is either a natural product consisting of dried powdered meat derived, for example, from domestic animals and productive livestock, e.g. pigs, horses, cattle, sheep, goats and poultry including chicken, duck, goose and turkey. It further surprisingly turned out that the natural content of fat in said natural meat powder of 20-55% -<br>
for the animal but also for achieving the desired softness of the final chewable product In context v^ the present invention, a "meat flavoring" shall refer to natural dried and powdered meat as well as to artificial meat flavorings, which are well-known from the food industry. It has however be recognized that artificial meat flavorings are only suitable for the present invention if they already contain 2055% (w/w) fat or if this amount of fat is added to the artificial flavoring. Fat that can be added to artificial meat flavorings can be chosen either from animal fats or preferably from plant fats including vegetable oils. However, if vegetable oils are used it is advantageous to use hardened/saturated oils. Unsaturated oils are usually<br><br>
Liquid at room temperature and result in products that do not show the desired ductility/softness. They are usually too soft. Presented is the use of saturated/hardened oils/fats that are generally solid at room temperature and lead to chewable compositions showing the desired ductility.<br>
Fats and oils contain many different fatty acids which affect the body in varying ways. Most simply, they are classified as saturated or unsaturated. Saturated fats sometimes are also cubed hardened fats. It is the saturated fat found in many animal products. Saturated fats are g reedy solid at room’ temperature. They are mainly of anural origin but can also be isolated from plants. Typical examples stemming from plants are cocoa butter and coconut and pear oils. These products are often used in store-bought baked goods, non-dairy whipped toppings, cream substitutes, most peanut butter and some margarines. Typical sources of saturated fat are: Animal Fat; Coconut Oil; Meat Fat; Bacon Fat; Cream; Palm Kernel Oil; Beef Fat; Palm Oil; Butter; Ham Fat; Pork Fat; Chicken Fat and Skin; Hardened Fat or Oil; Turkey Fat and Skin; Hydrogenated Vegetable Oil; Cocoa Butter, Lamb Fat; and Coconut<br>

Within the present invention the expression "soft" is used to characterize a product that is not as hard and crunchy as, for example, a cornflake and on the other hand is not as ductile as. for example, a marshmadow. The desired ductility/hardness lies sommeliers in between. If measured with a commercially available TEXTURE ANALYSER that is commodity available from Stable Micro Systems(TA-XT2 iHR/25), the texture (softness/hardies) of the chewables lies ideally between 6 -12 N.<br>
Hard and crunchy "products are speedily disadvarltageous if one intends to treat ocher dogs and cats because most of these old animals suffer from periodontal disease (Porte). This disease involves the inflammation and degeneration of tissues that surround and support the teeth. These include the gingival, alveolar bone, periodontal ligament, and cementer. Periodontitis or the loss of supporting bone is the latest stage of this progressive disorder and is the major cause of tooth loss in old dogs and cats. Animals suffering from periodontitis avoid eating hard and crunchy products because they cause them pain.<br>
The second important feature of the present Invention is the use or partially gelatinized starch. This starch contains 10-20% (w/w), preferably about 13-17% (w/w), most preferably 13-17% (w/w) pre-gelatinized starch. Thus is important as non-gelatinized and completely pre-gelatinized starch do not result in the desired ductility of the final product<br>
Starches exhibit thermal stability to about 121 °C. Starches are carbohydrates of a general formula (C6Hio05)n and are derived from com, wheat, oats, rice, potatoes, yucca and sim8ar plants and vegetables. They consist of about 27% linear polymer (amylase) and about 73% branched polymer (amyl pectin). The two polymers are intertwined within starch granules. Granules are insoluble in cold water, but soaking in hot water or under steam pressure -ruptures4heir<br>
a pregelatinized starch and has been used in muds for many years. Thus, pregelatinized starch is water-soluble starch that has undergone in-eversible changes by heating in water or steam. Many suitable pregelatinized starches are commercially available. For example, Master® Instant which is a pregelatinized Pea Starch with a high gel strength. Due to Its high amylases level, It has some remarkable properties. It shows an excellent stability to high temperatures, shearing and to variations in pH and is ideal for use in cold processes.<br><br>
A further important component is the softener, which keeps the moisture within the composition and allows to store the final product for weeks and months. It does not become hard and does not dry out.<br>
ff the mentioned meat flavoring, partially gelatinized starch and the basic component containing the active ingredient does not contain moisture one should add water during the extrusion process. This has an impact on the flexibility on the chewable veterinary compositions of the present invention. Itemed out that it is advantageous to adjust the" nfKKSture content of the product so that the final product contains water at a concentration equal to or tower than 9 % (w/w), preferably about 3 to 7 % (w/w), more preferably 4 to 6 % (w/w).<br>
For the present invention not only the proportion of meat flavoring and partially pre-gelatinized starch is extremely important but also the production process as such has an influence on the final product. The highly palatable ductile chewable veterinary composition of the present invention is the outcome of a special extrusion process. As such, extrusion is a very common thermoforming process widely used in the food industry for the production of customary feed pellets. However, in order to achieve the chewables according to the present invention, i.e. a highly palatable ductile product one has to modify the process and secure that the extradite is not heated during the  rifle extrusion process because this leads to hard and crunchy products, to losses of active ingredient, and especially to a decrease of the palatabiTrty, Actually, production in the desired manner can easily be achieved. The highly palatatrfe ductile chewable veterinary composition of the present invention is conveniently carried out in an injection molding machine or extruder. A mixture comprising an effective amount of one or more ingredients that are active against animal pests, pathogens or animal –diseases Beat wavering-partially-gelatinized Frand-up-to-9 faster-is fed through the hopper onto a rotating, reciprocating screw. The material moves along the screw towards the tip. During this process, its temperature is cooled down constantly by means of oatmeal coolers around the outside of the ban-el and by the shearing action of the screw. The cooling process is controlled so that the temperature of the extradites during the whole extensions process does not exceed peak temperature of 40'C. Starting in the feeding zone and continuing in the compression zone, the extradite should not reach temperatures higher than said 40°C. It has been found that ideally the product is extruded at or near room temperature, and the extruder is cooled dove  below room temperature, preferably to 5-10°C.<br><br>
It is then conveyed through the metering zone, where homogenization occurs, to the end of the screw. The homogenized material at the tip is then pressed through a form-determining die to obtain shaped articles of the desired size. The simplest way is cutting the extricate that leaves the ectoderm into equal pieces of the desired size. 'Desired' means that each piece contains the appropriate amount of active ingredient Thus, for example, for big dogs one would produce bigger pieces than for young cats. The amount of active tngrecBent has to be adapted to the bodyweight of the animal that has to be treated.<br>
This cooling during the extrusion process is extremely important because extruding this kirks of a material without cooling can easily lead to temperatures inside the entangler In the range of 100-200'C. High extrusion temperatures however transform the matrix of the extradites in an undesirable manner. The reason for this being that the starch is heated above the mating and glass transition temperatures of its components so that they undergo endothennic transitions. As a consequence a melting and disordering of the molecular structure of the starch granules takes place, so that an essentially destructurized starch is obtained. Instead of a ductile and rather soft product one obtains a hard or crunchy product which is not only refused by the animals but does not contain a reproducible amount of active ingredient Many active ingredients are not even stable enough at these relatively high temperatures and are at least partially degraded. As a result the biological activity of the product is reduced, and undesired degradation products can be formed that can cause undesired side effects or lead to allergic reactions. Cooling the extruder to temperatures near room temperature, preferably to 5-10**C, suppresses all these undesired effects and leads to a perfect product that is not only highly palatable but can surprisingly be stored for months without being degraded.<br>
The4w§hly-palatable-duGtile-Ghewable-veteriRary-eompesftien-ef4he-  also contain a sweetener for further improving the palatability. Any natural sugar can be used including confectioners’ sugar, multifold, xylitol, orbital, manifold, lactose, dextrose, saccharine, glucose or fructose, or any mixture thereof. In addition, artificial sweeteners known in the art, including saccharin, aspartame and Aciculae-K. may also be used. The sweetener is preferably present in an amount of from 1 to 10 % (war), preferably between from about 3 to about 7 % (w/w) based on the sweetening power of sucrose. The sweetener serves as a palatability enhancer due to its organoleptic properties. Enhancement of the<br><br>
palatability can be especially achieved in those cases where the active ingredient is extremely bitter or exhibits a taste that is absolutely not accepted by the animal.<br>
The veterinary composition of the present invention may also contain an antioxidant even so it turned out that in most of the cases this is not necessary. However, in certain cases the antioxidant serves as a preservative that increases the stability of ingredients that are not stable if exposed for a longer period of time to oxygen. The term "antioxidant" represents the tutees groups of antioxidants, true antioxidants, such as Tendon 2, Tendon PG, Tendon s-1, BHA (24-butyM-methoxypheno!), and BHT (2,6-di-t-butyl-4-methylphenol). sodium metabisulfite reducing agents and ant oxidant synergists, such as tocopherols (alpha, beta, or delta-tocopherol. tocopherol esters, alpha-tocopherol acetate), alkyl gallants, butylated hydroxyanisole, butylated hydroxytoluene, citric acid, eidetic acid and its salts, lecithin and tartaric acid. Further suitable antioxidants are reservation, quartering, benzoic acid, Trolled (N-acetylcysteine, 6-hydroxy-2,5.7,8-tetramethylchroman-2-cartDOxylic acid), dim ethyl theory (DMTU), desperation, tetrahydrocurcumin. tetrahydrodemethoxycurcumin, and monothioglycerol. Said antioxidant being added in concentrations ranging from 0 to 3.5 % (war), preferably 0.01 to 0.5 % (w/w). Preferred antioxidant are Tenox 2 and BHA (2-t-butyl-4-methoxyphenoI).<br>
Sodium chloride may also be added, up to about 4% (w/w), to further improve the palatability of the product and to bind moisture. For certain animals sodium chloride serves like a palatability enhancer.<br>
The highly palatable ductile chewable veterinary composition of the present invention further may contain a softener. The softener for use in the invention serves as a humectants which enhance s-toe-flexibility- ehew-aiid-retaiBSHT oyster<br>
chew is maintained at ambient temperatures. Typically, the softener is present in the highly palatable ductile chewable veterinary composition of the present invention at concentrations from about 10-20 % (w/w) and preferably about 11-15% (w/w) based upon the weight of the partially gelatinized starch. Suitable softeners include alcohols such as orbital, manioc, hexapod, pentagon and polo’s (such as glycerin, propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, and polypropylene glycol).<br><br>
The highly palatable ductile chewable veterinary composition of the present invention may further contain a coloring agent that lead to a better-looking product. The coloring agent can be selected from the group of azo dyes, organic or inorganic pigments, or coloring agents of natural origin, preferably from oxides of iron of titanium. Said coloring agent being added in concentrations ranging from 0 to 5 % (w/w), preferably 0.05 to 2 % (w/w). A preferred coloring agent is fennec oxide, that is normally used in an amount amour 0.1 % (w/w).<br>
Technical Equipment<br>
The extruder used for the production of the chewables according to the present invention is a co-rotating twin screw extruder type BCTG-62/28D with a   diameter of 62 mm and a screw length of L/D ratio of 28D with a polluting device from Buhler AG; Industriestrasse; CH-9240 Uzi; Switzerland. The feeder (delivering the dry blend into the extruder) is obtainable from K-Tran, Switzerland. It is a loss in weight feeder type K2-ML-T 35 twin screw feeder equipped with a AC (twin auger) screw. In addition two pumps are use to deliver glycerin and water separately. In addition, two chillers are used to maintain an extruder temperature below 10°C.<br>
Measurement of the softness/hardness of the chewables<br>
The texture (softness/hardness) of the dewy is measured by using a TEXTURE ANALYSER type; TA-XT2 iHR/25 that is commercially available from Stable Micro Systems Ltd. (Headquarters: Stable Micro Systems Ltd., Vienna Court, Lames Road; UK). One measures the peak force (in N) necessary to push a sphere with a melody of 1 mm/sec to penetrate 2mm into the chewable. The sphere has a diameter of 8 mm. The texture of the •chewables is measured-to-determine- before they are packaged into blisters. Texture after 24 hours: Typical values lay between 8 and 20 N.<br><br>
