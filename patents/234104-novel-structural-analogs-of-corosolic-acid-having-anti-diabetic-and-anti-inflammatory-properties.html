NOVEL STRUCTURAL ANALOGS OF COROSOLIC ACID HAVING ANTI-DIABETIC AND ANTI-INFLAMMATORY PROPERTIES<br>
TITLE OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to novel structural analogs of corosolic acid having anti-diabetic and anti-inflammatory properties. These compounds are found to exhibit potent hypoglycemic, 5-lipoxygenase inhibitory and antitumour activities.<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
Diabetes is perceived as a disorder of metabolism, where body’s natural ability to utilize food that has been broken down by digestion is vitiated. The body utilizes glucose, a major metabolic product from food, for energy and for cell growth. Glucose disperses throughout the body through the blood stream and enters cells with the help of a hormone called insulin. Insulin is produced by pancreas, a large gland beneath the stomach. In people with diabetes mellitus, either the pancreas does not produce enough insulin to move the glucose into the cells or the cells do not respond to the insulin, even though plenty is produced (Reaven, G. M., Role of insulin resistance in human disease; Diabetes, 1998, 37, 1595-1607). As a result of this impairment, glucose builds up in the blood stream and excreted out of the body without ever having been used as fuel.<br>
Untreated diabetes can lead to very serious chronic problems, including heart disease, kidney failure, blindness, nerve damage and amputations (Porte, D. et al., Science, 1996, 27, 699-700). Many experts believe that diabetes, cardiovascular disease and obesity all have a common factor linked by a condition called insulin resistance also known as Syndrome X (Bagchi, D., Syndrome X, The Diabetes, CVD<br><br>
and Obesity link, Health Products Business, June 2001, 62.). But with proper management, the risk of such problems can be greatly reduced. The management plan depends on the type of diabetes: insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) or noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM).<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
There are a number of agents currently available in the market for diabetes management, which belongs to various structural types. For example, thiazolidinediones, sulfonyl ureas, alpha-glucosidase inhibitors and biguanides are some of the drug types currently available in the market According to the American Diabetes Association, diabetes mellitus is estimated to effect 6% of the world population and the recent studies indicate that the number of diabetic patients could rise to 300 million by 2025. Worldwide sales of antidiabetic drugs reached 10 billion US dollars in 2002. Oral antidiabetics accounted for 63% of these sales and glucophase (metformin) was the leading product. With rising number of people suffering from diabetes worldwide, the market for diabetes medications could exceed $ 20 billion by 2006. In the natural products arena, a handful of herbal medications were proven to be effective against this terrible menace. For example, Fenugreek (Trigonella foenumgraeeum), Gymnema {Gymnema sylvestre) Jamun/Jambolan (Syzygiwn cumini\ Bitter melon/Karela (Momordica charantia) and Banaba (Lagerstroemia speciosd) are some of the products known to show fyypoglycemic activity. Natural antidiabetic treatments have gained popularity in the recent years because of their proven safety from long history of usage in traditional medicine and also present usage in herbal treatments. Banaba, Lagerstroemia speciosa L, has gotten the worldwide attention in the past few years as organic insulin. It is widely distributed in Philippines, as well as in Malaysia, South China and tropical Australia. Corosolic acid or colosolic acid (2a-hydroxyursolic acid, CAS No. 4547-24-4), a<br><br>
triterpenoid compound isolated from the banaba extract was found to be responsible for the antidiabetic activity. Banaba has long been recognized for the treatment of diabetes and also for maintenance of low blood pressure and improved kidney function in Philippines and other East Asian countries. Clinical studies confirmed the hypoglycemic effects of corosolic acid (Judy, W.V. et aL, /. EthnopharmacoL, 2003, 87(1), 115-7). Indian species of Lagerstroemia (Lagerstroemia parviflora, Lagerstroemia indica, Lagerstroemia spedosa, etc), which grows along east coast from Orissa to West Bengal, also produce corosolic acid. Matsuyama, US patent No. 6,485,760 (2002) described the blood sugar lowering effect of Lagerstroemia extract.<br><br>
Presently, there has been a tremendous surge in the demand for non-steroidal, plant based anti-inflammatory agents. 5-Lipoxygenase is the key enzyme for the biosynthesis of leukotrienes and 5(S)-HETE, the important mediators for inflammatory, allergic and obstructive process, from arachidonic acid. 5-Lipoxygenase is the target enzyme for identifying inhibitors, which have the potential to cope with a variety of inflammations and hypersensitivity-based human diseases including asthma, arthritis, bowl diseases such as ulcerative colitis and circulatory<br><br>
disorders such as shock and ischaemia. Scientists around the world have invested major effort during the last ten years, in identifying 5-lipoxygenase inhibitors from plant sources. Gum resin of Boswellia species known as Indian frankincense has been used as an anti-inflammatory agent in traditional Ayurvedic Medicine in India. The source of anti-inflammatory actions has been attributed to boswellic acids (Safayhi, H., et aL, Planta Medico, 1997, 63, 487-493 and J. Pharmacol Exp. Then, 1992, 261, 1143-46, both the journals published from USA), a group of triterpene acids isolated from the Boswellia resin (Padhy, R.S., et aL, Indian J. Chem., 1978, 16B, 176-178). During our search for new anti-inflammatory agents, we have observed, to the best of our knowledge for the first time that corosolic acid is a potential inhibitor of 5-LOX. The inhibitory activity was found to be on par with 3-O-acetyl-ll-keto-p-boswellic acid(AKBA).<br>
The olenane and ursane triterpenoids also gained prominence recently for their antiproliferative actions. As 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX) is the first enzyme in the metabolic pathway leading to the formation of leukotrienes and eicosanoids that are important in carcinogenesis process, inhibitors of 5-LQX may thus have profound influence on the growth and apoptosis of various cancer lines (Yong S. Park, et. aL, Planta Medica, 2002, 68, 397-401). Boswellic acids, for example inhibited several leukemia cell lines in vitro and inhibited melanoma growth and induced apoptosis (Hostanska, K., et aL, Anticancer Res., 2002, 22(5), 2853-62). The acetyl boswellic acids were found to be unique class of dual inhibitors of human topoisomerages I and II a (Syrovets, T. et. aL, Mol Pharmacol, 2000, 58(1), 71-81). A number of oleanane and ursane tripenoids were found to be powerful inhibitors of nitric oxide production in macrophases, which can be correlated to their cancer chernoprevention activity (Honda, T. et aL, J. Med. Chenu, 2000, 43, 1866-77). Corosolic acid, which has the gross structure very similar to AKBA and other ursane derivatives, may thus hold promise as an antitumor agent.<br><br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention was aimed at producing novel analogs of corosolic acid for structure-activity relationship studies. The main objective was to make analogs with enhanced water solubility and increased hypoglycemic activity. The functional groups that can be expended to make new analogs are carboxyl group, trisubstituted double bond and vicinal diol. The hydroxyl groups found utility to couple with moieties like natural acids and aminoacids, which not only improves water solubility but also presumed to enhance the biological recognition to the parent compound in the transport process.<br>
The acid function was utilized to attach highly polar amine moieties through an amide linkage. The same group can also be utilized to make ester compounds* by reacting with alcohols or halides. The lower alkyl esters can be reduced with LAH (lithium aluminum hydride) to introduce an additional alcohol group as depicted in structure 23. Oxidizing agents suitable for allylic oxidation, such as chromium trioxide can be utilized to generate 11-ketocorosolic acid compounds. Allylic oxidation using NBS (N-bromosucinimide) however yielded a lactone 26. The acylation transformation can be controlled to yield monoacylated compounds or diacylated compound by limiting the quantities of acylating agent. The general strategy to attach amino acid unit was coupling of BOC (tert-butoxycarbonyl) protected amino acids like glycine and alanine etc. to corosolic acid using DCC (1,3-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide), DMAP [4-(dimethylamino)-pyridine] followed’ - by deprotection of BOC group using HCl/dioxane to yield glycyl and alanyl derivatives, respectively, of corosolic acid.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
A still further aspect of the present invention is a method of treating diabetes, comprising administering to a human or animal subject in need thereof a treatment effective amount (e.g., an amount effective to treat, slow the progression of, etc.) of a compound as described above.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions of the “compound” as used herein, includes the pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compound Pharmaceutically acceptable salts are salts that retain the desired biological activity of the parent compound and do not impart undesired toxicological effects. Examples of such salts are (a) base addition salts formed from metal hydroxides, NH4OH, alkyl amines, pharmaceutically useful aniine compounds etc. (b) acid addition salts formed with inorganic acids, for example hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfiiric acid, phosphoric acid etc. on amine compounds represented by the formula I.<br>
Active compounds of the present invention may be produced by the procedures described herein or variations thereof, which will be apparent to those skilled in the art. The intermediates useful for producing the compounds of the formula I, described herein are also an aspect of the present invention, as are methods useful for producing such intermediates and active compounds.<br>

Hypoglycemic activity: Hypoglycemic activity was tested by the inhibition of sucrose-induced raise in serum glucose levels (SGL), by the test substances in Albino wistar rats. The procedure involves fasting the rats for overnight at ad libitum water, numbered weighed and randomly divided into groups of six animals each. Prior to treatment blood samples were drawn from sinus orbital plexus of all animals using heparin coated glass capillaries under mild ether anesthesia. The blood samples were tested for serum glucose levels using enzymatic GOD/POD method. Optical densities were measured at 500 nm, SGL was calculated as follows. SGL = (test OD / Standard OD) x 100 and the results were expressed in mg/dL. All the groups were treated orally with corresponding test substances, standard, vehicle (5% gum acacia). After 30 minutes, all animals were given 20 mL/kg of 20% sucrose solution orally using gastric tube. One hour after treatment, blood samples were drawn again under rnild ether anesthesia and tested for serum glucose levels in a same procedure as described above for initial serum glucose estimation. The data was subjected to statistical treatment using t-test and inhibitory rate was calculated by comparing mean increase in serum glucose levels of control and treated groups.<br>
5-Lipoxygenase activity: The corosolic acid analogs were screened for their 5-Lipoxygenase inhibitory potential using colorimetric method. The assay mixture contained 50 mM phosphate buffer pH 6.3, 5-Lipoxygenase, various concentrations of test substances in dimethyl sulphoxide and linoleic acid in a total volume of 0.5 mL, after 5 min incubation of above reaction mixture, 0.5 mL ferric xylenol orange reagent was added and OD was measured after two minutes at 585 nm using<br><br>
spectrophotometer. Controls were run along with test in a similar manner except using vehicle instead of test substance solution. Percent inhibition was calculated by comparing absorbance of test solution with that of control.<br>
Brine shrimp lethality: Brine shrimp (Anemia salina) nauplii were hatched using brine shrimp eggs in a conical shaped vessel (1 L), filled with sterile artificial sea water (prepared using sea salt 38 g/L and adjusted to pH 8.5 using 1 N NaOH) under constant aeration for 48 h. After hatching, 10 nauplii were drawn through a pepette and placed in each vial containing 4.5 mL brine solution and added various concentrations of drug solutions and volume was made upto 5 mL using brine solution and maintained at 37°C for 24 h under the light of incandescent lamps and surviving larvae were counted. Each experiment was conducted along with control (vehicle treated), at various concentrations of the test substance in each set that contains 6 tubes and the average results are reported. The percentage lethality was determined by comparing the mean mortal larvae of test and control tubes. LC50 values were obtained from the plot of concentration (µg) vs. percentage lethality. Podophyllotoxin was used as a positive control.<br>
