				<td>NATURAL HONEY-CONTAINING COMPOSITIONS AND METHOD OE PREPARATION<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to flavour compositions comprising natural honey and a chelant and compositions comprising said flavour compositions and a cellulosic polymer. Processes of preparing the compositions of the present invention are also provided.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Natural honey is a useful and important flavouring agent and possesses some medical and herbal benefits. Natural honey is becoming increasingly used in medicinal preparations, as well as food and beverage compositions. The stability of these compositions when comprising natural honey may be affected as a result of the constituents of the natural honey itself. For example, natural honey has been shown to have a starch (amylose and amylopectin) degradation effect due to the presence of amylase, an enzyme that cleaves the αl-4 linkage between glucose units (Babacan. S. et al, (2002) Honey Amylase Activity and Eoocl Starch Degradation 67(5), pp 1625 - 1630).<br>
The present inventors have found that when natural honey is used in a composition comprising a cellulosic polymer, as opposed to starch-based molecules, degradation of the cellulosic polymer can be observed. This degradation was not associated with amylase activity in the natural honey, as amylase does not impact cellulosic polymers to a significant extent. The present inventors identified the presence of eellulase enzymes in natural honey as the cause of the degradation of the cellulosic polymers. Cellulase is previously unreported as being present in natural honey. Although it is common to refer to mixture of compounds that can degrade cellulose as cellulase it is really composed of more than one enzymes, including ß-1-4-glueanase and P-glucosidase (see the schematic below).<br>
CMC B-1-4glucanase   Cello-oligosaccharides    Bela -glucosidase	Glucose<br>
The use of natural honey in combination with cellulosic polymers resulted in a lack of stability of the final composition, generally identified as a loss of viscosity of the formulation. Therefore, a need exists for compositions and flavours comprising natural honey and methods of<br>
preparation such that, when used in combination with cellulosic polymers, the natural honey does not result in degradation of cellulosic polymers and subsequent compositional instability.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention provides a honey composition consisting essentially of:<br>
a)	natural honey comprising at least one eellulase enzyme; and<br>
b)	a chelant.<br>
Furthermore, the present invention provides a composition comprising;<br>
a)	natural honey comprising at least one eellulase enzyme;<br>
b)	a chelant; and<br>
c)	a cellulosic polymer.<br>
Further still, the present invention provides a process for the manufacture of a composition comprising natural honey comprising the step of mixing a chelant with natural honey comprising at least one cellulose enzyme and optionally a earner. The compositions and methods of preparation provide natural honey containing compositions that have improved stability.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS Figure   1   demonstrates   the   loss  of  viscosity  associated   with   the  degradation  of earboxymethyleellulose sodium in a system comprising natural honey and the inhibition of said polymer degradation and viscosity loss when using chelants treatment.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
As used herein, all percentages are weight percentages unless otherwise indicated. All temperatures are in degrees Celsius (°C) unless otherwise indicated.<br>
The present invention provides a honey composition consisting essentially of natural honey comprising at least one cellulose enzyme and a chelant. The honey composition may be formulated as a flavour composition by combining the natural honey and chelant with a earner. Furthermore, the present invention provides for a composition comprising natural honey comprising at least one cellulose enzyme in combination with a chelant and a cellulosic polymer.<br>
Natural Honey<br>
The compositions, flavour compositions and processes of manufacture herein require the presence of natural honey. As used herein, the term "natural honey" includes honey produced by<br>
bees (Apis inellifera L.) or other insects from the nectar of plants or from secretions of living parts of plants which the bees collect, transform by combining with specific substances of their own. deposit, dehydrate, store and leave in the honey comb to ripen and mature. The natural honey must contain at least one cellulose enzyme<br>
The honey composition herein consisting essentially of natural honey and a chelant contains natural honey. When used in a complete composition in conjunction with a cellulosic polymer, the natural honey is preferably present at levels of from about 0.1% to about 25% by weight of the composition. More preferably, the composition comprises from about 0.1% to about 15%, more preferably still from about 0.1 % to about 10% natural honey by weight of the composition.<br>
Chelant<br>
The honey composition, honey flavour composition and the composition of the present invention further comprise a chelant. Without wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that the chelant acts to chelate the metal cefaclor held within the quaternary structure of the eellulase enzyme present in the natural honey. As a result, the eellulase enzyme is partially denatured, thereby decreasing its enzymatic activity.<br>
As used herein the term "chelant" includes compounds and materials that means a molecule containing two or more electron donor atoms that can form coordinate bonds to a single metal ion. The term "chelant" is understood to include the chelant as well as salts thereof. For example, the term "chelant" includes citric acid as well as its salt forms.<br>
The most common and widely used chelants coordinate to metal atoms through oxygen or nitrogen donor atoms, or both. Other less common chelants coordinate through sulfur in the form of -SH (thiol or mereapto) groups. After the first coordinate bond is formed, each successive donor atom that binds creates a ring containing the metal atom. A chelant may be bidentate. tridentate, tetradentate, etc.. depending upon whether it contains two, three, four, or more donor atoms capable of binding to the metal atom. See Kirk-Othmer Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology (4th ed. 2001).<br>
The chelant may be soluble or insoluble in the natural honey as long as it is readily available for complexation with metal ions in the food. Various classes of chelant are suitable for use in the present invention. Non-limiting examples of these classes include polyphosphates (e.g., sodium tripolyphosphate, hexametaphosphoric acid, sodium acid pyrophosphate, sodium pyrophosphate,     tetra     sodium     pyrophosphate,     sodium     hexametaphosphate,     sodium<br>
etaphosphate); aminoearboxylic acids (e.g.. ethylenediaminetetraaeetic acid (EDTA), 1.2-bis(2-aniino-phenoxy)ethane-N.N.N'N'-tetraacetic acid (EGTA). ethylenebis(oxyethylenenitrilo)-tetraacetic acid (BAPTA), N-(hydroxyethyl)-ethylenediaminetriacetic acid (HEDTA). diethylene-triaminepentaaeetie acid (DTPA), N-dihydroxyethylglycine (2-HxG), ethylenebis(hydroxyphenyl-glycine) (EHPG). glutamic acid, aspartic acid, glycine, lysine); 1,3-diketones (e.g., acetylacetone, trifluoroaeetylacetone, thenoyltrifluoroacetone. ascorbic acid): hydroxycarboxylic acids (e.g., tartaric acid, citric acid, malic acid, gluconic acid, ferulie acid, lactic acid, glucuronic acid); polyamines (e.g.. dietheylenetriamine. triethylenetriamine); aminoalcohols (e.g., triethanolamine. N-hydroxyethylethylene-diamine, aminoethylethanolamine (AEEA); phenols (e.g.. disulfo-pyrocatechol, ehromotropie acid); aminophenols (e.g.. oxinesulfonic acid); Schiff bases (e.g.. disalicylaldehyde 1,2-propylenediimine); tetrapyrroles (e.g.. tetraphenylporphin, phthalocyanine); silicates (aluminum calcium silicate, calcium silicate, sodium aluminosilicate sodium calcium aluminosilieate (hydrates), tricalcium silicate); sulfur compounds (e.g.. potassium ethyl xanate. sodium diethyldithiocarbamate, diethyl dithiophosphoric acid, thiourea, magnesium sulfate); synthetic macroeyelie compounds (e.g., hexamethyl-[14J-4,ll-dieneN4. 2.2.2-eryptate); polymers (e.g., polyethyleneimines. polymethaeryloylaeetone, poly(p-vinylbenzyliminodiacetic acid)). phosphonic and bisphosphonic acids (e.g., nitrilotrimethylenephosphonic acid, ethylenediaminetetra-(methylenephosphonic acid), hydroxyethylidenediphosphonic acid).<br>

Process of Manufacture<br>
The present invention further provides for a process of manufacturing a composition comprising natural honey comprising the step of mixing a chelant with natural honey and optionally a earner. The chelant may be added neat to the natural honey and mixed, or added as a solution in water or similar diluent. The natural honey and chelant are mixed together using mixing techniques known to those skilled in the art. non-limiting examples of which include stirring, extruder mixing, shaking and the like. The mixing step must be sufficient to ensure appropriate distribution of the chelant in the natural honey so as to effectively inhibit the cellulase present in the natural honey.<br>
The process of the present invention may preferably include an additional step in which the natural honey is heated either before or after the chelant is mixed with the natural honey, preferably after the mixing of the chelant with the natural honey. The heating step generally involves heating the natural honey or natural honey and chelant mix to a temperature of from about 90°C to about 140°C, preferably from about 100°C to about 120°C. The heating step preferably has a duration of from about 1 minute to about 60 minutes, preferably about 1 minute to about 30 minutes and more preferably from about 1 minute to about 10 minutes. Without wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that the heating step denatures the eellulase enzyme present in the natural honey, thereby deactivating it. The eellulase enzyme however is quite robust, and apparently due to the presence of a central metal cofactor, able to renature over a period of time even after exposure to high temperature. The combination of heat treatment either in the presence of a chelant or with subsequent addition of the chelant results in the central metal cofaetor being exposed and more readily chelated by the chelant. Removal of the metal cofactor inhibits the re-folding of the eellulase enzyme, resulting in a more efficient and permanent inhibition of the eellulase enzyme in the natural honey.<br>
The heating step may be earned out using processes and equipment known to those skilled in the art, non-limiting examples of which include autoclaving, pressurized heating vessels, heating vessels with mixing capability. Preferably, the heating step is undertaken in an autoclave with stirring capability or other suitable jacketed pressurized mixing vessel.<br>
