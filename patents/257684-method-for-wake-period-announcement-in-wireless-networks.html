				<td>FIELD OF TECHNOLOGY<br>
This invention relates to the field of wireless networks and to medium access control for wireless personal area networks that are based on wireless mobile ad-hoc networks. Further, this invention relates to devices that send their beacons to announce their existence and to power save and wakeup mechanisms of devices in wireless networks. The invention provides mechanisms for announcement of local wakeup intervals and global wakeup intervals of the device operating in wireless network. More particularly, this invention encompasses a system and method for announcement of local and global wakeup intervals in wireless personal area networks based on ultra wide band (UWB) systems.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART<br>
The wireless personal area networks are defined to operate in the personal operating space, i.e. in a range of approximately 10 meters. The IEEE (http://www.ieee.org) is involved in defining standards for such wireless personal area networks. The Ultra Wide Band (UWB) technology can provide data rates exceeding several hundreds of Mbps in this personal operating space. In wireless personal area networks, the medium is shared between all the devices for communication with each other. This necessitates a medium access control mechanism for the devices to manage medium access, broadly including how they may join the network, how they can transfer data at the required rate to<br><br>
another device, how the medium is best used, how to detect and resolve beacon collisions, etc.<br>
Medium access control for wireless personal area networks can be designed in two approaches - centralized and distributed. In the centralized approach, one of the device acts on behalf of the whole network to coordinate in managing the medium access operations for all the devices. All other devices seek help of the centralized coordinator for medium access operations like joining the network, reserving channel time, etc. In the Distributed approach, the medium access operations are distributed evenly across all devices in the network and all the devices share the load of managing medium access operations for each other. While the IEEE standards employ a centralized medium access control mechanisms, some distributed medium access control mechanisms are under discussions for WPANs as they offer flexibility in terms of mobility of devices.<br>
Figure 1 illustrates a wireless personal area network, which is based on distributed approach and which does not have any centralized coordinator. It involves a decentralized WPAN, in which devices are light coordinator and there is no dedicated coordinator present. All devices cooperate and share information with each other to perform the medium access control tasks such as allowing a new device to join, allocation of channel time to a device to transmit data to another device, synchronization mechanisms, etc. This is a Distributed WPAN system which is formed in an ad-hoc fashion. Each device periodically broadcasts the information about its neighbors and allocated channel time to its<br><br>
neighbors.<br>
The Distributed medium access control approach relies on a timing concept called the Superframe. Superframe has a fixed length in time and is divided into a number of time windows which are called time slots. Some of the time slots are used by the devices to send their beacons and the other are used by the devices to send the data. The slots in which beacons are sent are called beacon slots and the slots in which data is sent are called data slots. The length of a beacon period may be less than the length of a data period. The beacon slots may be distributed across the slots in the superframe or may appear together at the start of the superframe. In addition, the number of beacon slots may be fixed or variable leading to different configurations of Distributed Medium Access Control mechanisms.<br>
Figure 2 illustrates the superframe structure, specified by the Multiband OFDM Alliance (MBOA, http://www.multibandofdm.org) draft vO.95. It consists of several Medium Access Slots (As an example, the number is shown as 256). Some Medium Access Slots (MAS) constitute beacon period (comprising of beacon slots corresponding to multiple devices) and remaining MASs constitute data period (comprising of data slots that may be used by different devices in the network to transmit data to other devices in the network), employs a superframe duration of 65,536 microsecond with 256 MASs, and each MAS is of 256 microsecond duration. Information about superframe is being broadcasted by each device in its broadcasted beacons, so neighbors of that device can use that<br><br>
information for further processing. The start time of the superframe is determined by the beginning of the beacon period and defined as the beacon period start time (BPST).<br>
Devices that belong to the same beacon period shall utilize the same BPST for the superframe. However, some of the devices may define a different time as their BPST. In such cases, 2 or more beacon groups may coexist for the device. MASs are numbered relative to this starting time. The devices shall transform the numbering of MASs of other beaconing periods into the time reference of their main beaconing period. A device can be part of several beacon periods but has to select one beacon period as its main beacon period.<br>
Devices shall utilize the same BPST for the superframe. MASs are numbered relative to this starting time. All devices shall hear the beacon period at the start of the superframe and shall be time synchronized.<br>
MBOA-MAC in its present form has defined two modes of operation, active mode and hibernating mode. In active mode the device can either be in awake state or in sleep state. In awake state the device's transmitter and receivers are fully powered using more power even if they are not currently transmitting or receiving (idle condition). In the sleep state the device has powered down its transmitter and receiver circuitry and is using minimum power. In the active mode, devices switch between awake and sleep state depending on the data<br><br>
reservations already announced during the beacon period. The second power saving mechanism is where devices announce that they want to go to Hibernation mode. Devices that are going into hibernate mode announce in their beacon that they will be in hibernation for a certain number of superframes, during which they will be in deep sleep mode; they will not send or receive beacons or any other traffic; or will not try to listen any other traffic. Other devices in its BG will note this announcement and continue to include those devices in their BPOIE until the mentioned wakeup interval. Also, devices in the BG will maintain information in their local database about devices that are hibernating and will defer communication to them until they power on and start sending beacons.<br>
The stated medium access control mechanism can be used for communication of internet protocol traffic. One of the work group named WiNET of WiMedia Alliance (www.wimedia.org) is involved in standardization of this architecture. WiNET version 0.63 defines a protocol adaptation layer (PAL) for IPv6 and IPv4 to work over MBOA MAC-PHY. WiNET devices can connect to any other network outside WPAN via any WiNET based gateway or bridge device.<br>
According to current art explained in Indian patent application no. 553/CHE/2004, each device could be a WiNET device can be periodically awake during its local wakeup time. That information can be useful by all neighboring devices which are planning to communicate with other device. Similarly all WiNET devices can be awake during their periodic global wakeup time. That<br><br>
information can be useful by all devices for functions like device discovery etc. During this time all devices will be awake and any global information can be broadcasted, for e.g. change in period of local or global wakeup time. Global wakeup time can be broadcasted by gateway or bridge device.<br>
The present state of art in this field, has certain limitations, namely, there is no mechanism to announce local wakeup period and global wakeup period for the devices.<br>
Currently the mechanism, as defined in current art, can suffer from following limitations:<br>
1.	A device can go in hibernation mode and become awake depending on its own decision making parameters; or it can be awake for one or more superframes periodically, so other device want to communicate can use that information and can be awake for same superframe. There is no method to communicate to other devices this period (called "local wakeup superframe") in number of superframes, when device will be definitely awake in that superframe.<br>
2.	All devices can go in hibernation mode and become awake depending on their own decision making parameters; or they can be awake for one or more superframes periodically at same time in synchronized manner, so all devices can perform functions like device discovery and broadcast of<br><br>
other information from upper layer, which can be received by all devices, because all device will be awake in that superframe. There is no method to communicate to other devices this period (called "global wakeup superframe") in number of superframes, when all device will be definitely awake in that superframe.<br>
