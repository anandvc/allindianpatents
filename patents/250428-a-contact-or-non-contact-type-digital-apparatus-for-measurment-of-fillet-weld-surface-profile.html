FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention refers to the development of Digital gauge for measuring various<br>
dimensions of a completed fillet weld.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Fillet weld is a weld at the junction of two parts, e.g. plates at right angles to<br>
each other, in which a fillet of welding metal is laid down in the angle created by<br>
the intersection of the surfaces of the parts.<br>
Fillet welds are widely used in several applications either as single pass weld or a<br>
multi-pass weld. This involves welding of different thickness material which may<br>
be of steel or non ferrous categories. At least one of the edges joined may also<br>
have edge preparations. During welding one of the members may distort so that<br>
the initial angle between the two components before welding may be changed<br>
due to distortion. In practical conditions the weld gauge has to take in to<br>
consideration the factors like the surface profile of the fillet, equal or unequal leg<br>
sizes, the angle between the components joined etc. while measuring the weld<br>
dimensions.<br><br>
-3-<br>
The mechanical gauges have been developed and applied for this purpose.<br>
However, in the application of these gauges, the accuracies are limited by nature<br>
of the bead surface - Concavity / Convexity or metere joint and the angle<br>
between plate surfaces joined by the fillet. In order to eliminate these difficulties<br>
a new type of gauge is proposed which would give a digital output of the leg<br>
sizes and throat size of he fillet after the required measurements and<br>
calculations. In addition the gauge can be used for measuring the edge<br>
preparation angle of a bevel edge prepared plate/pipe.<br>
As prior art references in this field<br>
Patent No. GB439319 has described a gauge for checking dimensions relating<br>
to welded joints in which one or more blade like members, shaped and<br>
dimensioned at the ends and/or sides in accordance with suitable shapes and<br>
sizes for said joints, are pivoted in a holder, so as to be opened out for use and<br>
closed into the holder when not in use.<br><br>
-4-<br>
Document W00221071 has disclosed an adjustable gauge having special<br>
application to the measuring of the dimensions of a fillet weld. The gauge<br>
includes a first plate and a second plate wherein the plates are rotatably<br>
mounted about an axis of rotation and juxtaposed to one another. The gauge<br>
also includes a linear member rotatably mounted on the same axis of rotation as<br>
the first and second plates juxtaposed to the second plate on a first face<br>
opposite the first plate. The linear member is slidably mounted in relation to the<br>
first and second plates in order to extend so as to measure the dimension of a<br>
weld. The first plate is substantially rectangular in shape and terminates in an<br>
edge, which traverses one corner thereof. The second plate is substantially<br>
circular in shape. A front face of the first plate, which is adjacent to the second<br>
plate, has a recess thereon sized to accommodate the second plate. The first<br>
plate, the second plate, and the linear member are rotatably mounted to one<br>
another with a spring based mechanism for increasing and decreasing the<br>
rotational resistance there between.<br>
The above state of prior art suffers from the difficulties that the gauges are<br>
limited in accuracies in measurement of dimensions in respect of complex<br>
formation of weld profile and change of angle between the two members during<br>
welding.<br><br>
-5-<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
One object of the present invention is to develop a non-contact type digital<br>
measurement apparatus for measuring the leg sizes of the fillet welds, which<br>
may be equal or unequal leg sizes.<br>
Another object of the invention is to measure the throat size of the fillet weld<br>
that may have a concave or convex weld profile.<br>
Yet another object of the invention is to measure the angle of edge preparation.<br>
A further object of the invention is to carry out the measurement through non-<br>
contact measurement systems by using a single mathematical program for<br>
arriving at the desired dimensions.<br>
According to the invention there is provided a contact or non-contact type digital<br>
gauge apparatus for measurement of fillet weld surface profile comprising of two<br>
measuring devices mounted on a slide and integrated with a processing unit with<br>
a built-in algorithm, a base fixed on a horizontal part, a vertical shaft guide<br><br>
-6-<br>
mounted on the base, the two measuring devices measuring the distances<br>
between the measuring devices and selected locations (such as A, B, C &amp; D) on<br>
the fillet and above the fillet, one device measuring at selected points the<br>
distances from this device to the vertical part of the component joined to the<br>
horizontal part by the fillet and the other device measuring the distances<br>
between the measuring device and the horizontal surface (base) of the<br>
component for all the selected points measured by the other device, feeding the<br>
measured distances as data inputs in a processing unit and computing the fillet<br>
dimensions through a built in algorithm in the processor and displaying the same<br>
in a display device.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
In this invention, an apparatus has been developed to measure the sizes of a<br>
fillet weld. This apparatus is making use of two, length - measuring gauges fixed<br>
along a vertical shaft. The out put of the gauges are displayed by a digital meter.<br>
Also, the outputs can be fed to a micro controller based processing unit, which<br>
will process the digital data and give the digital output of fillet weld sizes. The<br><br>
-7-<br>
apparatus can also measure with ease, equal or unequal fillets, concave, convex<br>
or flat profiles of the fillet and any angle between the surfaces joined by the<br>
fillet. The length - measuring gauge can be either contact or non-contact type.<br>
The proposed invention will be better understood from the following description<br>
in which<br>
Figure 1 shows schematically the essential features of the apparatus for the<br>
measurement of the weld dimensions.<br>
Fillet weld is made between the two parts (1) and (2)<br>
A vertical guide (3) is mounted on a base (4) fixed on the part (2). The base will<br>
be suitable for mounting on flat as well as curved surfaces.<br>
Two, distance measuring devices (5) and (6) are mounted on a slide (7).<br>
The weld (8) is made to join 1 and 2.<br>
A, B, C and D are locations where measurements are made.<br>
X1 and H1 are the distances measured at location A.<br><br>
-8-<br>
The apparatus has two distance measuring systems. One measuring device (5)<br>
will measure the distance from this measuring device to the vertical part of the<br>
component, which is joined to the horizontal part by the fillet. This measuring<br>
device will measure the distance at four points. One (A) of this will be above the<br>
fillet, two (B &amp; D) at the toes of the fillet and one (C) at the maximum concavity<br>
or convexity on the fillet profile. The other measuring device (6) will measure<br>
distance between the measuring device and the horizontal surface (base) of the<br>
component for all the four points measured by the other measuring device.<br>
The base of the apparatus is designed to enable setting the apparatus on a flat<br>
surface or a curved surface. The base has a vertical shaft (3) on which the<br>
distance measuring devices are suitably mounted on a slide (7). The slide moves<br>
vertically up and down and it is operated manually to position the measuring<br>
devices at suitable positions for carrying out the measurement at four points as<br>
described above.<br>
The output from the measuring devices in the digital form are fed to a<br>
processing unit. The data input are processed using a mathematical program,<br>
built-in to the processor. The output from the processor can be displayed<br>
digitally through a display device. The processed data provided two leg lengths<br>
and the actual throat of the fillet.<br><br>
-9-<br>
The algorithm used the processor has been developed for the purpose of<br>
measurement has the following mathematical characters for measuring vertical<br>
and horizontal parts of the fillet through measuring distances between measuring<br>
devices and the fillet for vertical and horizontal surface of the fillet.<br>
