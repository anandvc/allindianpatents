				<td>Process for the preparation of a 2-cthylaminopyridinc derivative<br>
The present invention relates to a novel process for the preparation of 2-ethylaminopyridine derivative which is useful as an intermediate compound for the preparation of pesticides, starting with 2-halogenopyridine derivative.<br>
Patent application WO 2004/016088 discloses the preparation of N-[2-(2-pyridinyl)ethyl]benzamide derivatives starting from 2-halogenopyridine derivatives to produce 2-ethylaminopyridine derivatives and then coupling these 2-ethylaminopyridine derivatives with a halogenobenzoyl derivative. A step of this process consists in the reduction of a 2-methylcyanopyridine derivative into a 2-ethylaminopyridine in the presence of a metal catalyst in a protic solvent.<br>
The process disclosed in this patent application presents the drawback in that the yield of the step of reduction of the 2-methylcyanopyridine derivative to produce a 2-ethylaminopyridine derivative is low and not acceptable at an industrial scale.<br>
The process disclosed in this patent application also presents the drawback in that two separate steps are necessary for the preparation of the 2-methylcyanopyridine derivative starting from the 2-halogenopyridine derivative. This consequently increase the costs of the process and decrease its global yield, which is not acceptable at an industrial scale.<br>
We have now found an alternative method to prepare 2-ethylaminopyridine derivative which overcomes these problems and which is applicable to industrial scale operation.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention relates to a process for the preparation of a 2-ethylaminopyridine derivative of general formula (I) or a salt thereof<br>

Preferably, the present invention relates to the preparation of N-[2-(2-pyridinyl)ethyl]carboxamide derivative of general formula (II) in which A is a phenyl group and in which the different characteristics may be chosen alone or in combination as being :<br>
-	A is substituted by 1 or 2 substituents. More preferably, A is substituted by 1<br>

-	each substituent is chosen, independently of the others, as being a hydrogen atom, a<br>
halogen atom, a C1-C8-alkyl or a C1-C8-halogenoalkyl having 1 to 5 halogen atoms.<br>
More preferably each substituent is chosen, independently of the others, as being<br>

The fourth step (step D) of the process according to the present invention comprises the coupling reaction the 2-ethylaminopyridine obtained in step C with a halide benzoyl derivative to provide a compound of general formula (II) as defined above. Such a coupling reaction may be performed by known methods. Such a coupling reaction may for example be conducted according to the Schotten-Baumann reaction described in Schotten Ber. 1884, 17, 2544 and Baumann Ber. 1886, 19, 3218, herein incorporated by reference.<br>
The compounds of general formula (I) and of formula (II) according to the present invention can be prepared according to the above described process. It will nevertheless be understood that, on the basis of his general knowledge and of available publications, the skilled worker will be able to adapt this method according to the specifics of each of the compounds, which it is desired to synthesise.<br>
Certain of the intermediates used for the preparation of compound of general formula (I) are novel. Therefore, the present invention also relates to novel intermediate compounds useful for the preparation of compound of general formula (I). Thus, according to the present invention, there is provided a compound of general formula (III)<br><br>

The present invention will now be illustrated with reference to the following examples.<br>
Preparation of 3-chloro-5-(trifluoromcthvl)-2-cthylaminc-pvridinyI<br>
Step 1: Preparation of a 3-chloro-5-(trifluoromethvl)-2-methvlcyanopwidine<br>
A two-necked round bottom flask equipped with a magnetic bar, a thermometer and a reflux condenser was charged with the 2,3-dichloro-5-(trifluoromethyl)-pyridine in NMP (14.6% w/v), KOH (2.2 equiv.). The solution was heated to 70Â°C and the ethyl cyanoacetate (1.2 equiv.) was added slowly. After the addition the reaction medium was heated 3h. HC1 aq. 36% was added to obtained pH 2 and the mixture was heated to 130Â°C for 2h. At 20Â°C, NaOH aq. IN was added and the aqueous phase was extracted 3 times with methyl terbutyl ether (MTBE). The organic phases were combined, washed with water, dried over MgSO4 and concentrated to the dryness. The isolated yield was 94%. NMR'H (300 Mz, CDC13): 4.15 (s, 2H, CH2), 8.0 (s, 1H, Hpyr.), 8.79 (s, 1H, Hpyr.).<br>
Step 2 : Preparation of a 3-chloro-5-(trifluoromethyl)-2-ethvlacetamide-pvridinvl<br>
A hydrogenation reactor was charged with 3-chloro-5-trifluoromethyl -2-methylcyano pyridine (7g, 31.4 mMol), Pd/C 5% (1.05g), Ac2O (12.8g, 125.8 mMol, 4 equiv.), AcOH (60ml). The reactor was stirred under 30 bars of hydrogen at 20Â°C for 5 hours. The hydrogen was removed, the catalyst filtrated out and the solvent was evaporated. 8.4 g of crude desired product was obtained. HPLC titrated yield = 71%. Mass spectrum : 266 DA, MH* : 267<br>
Step 3 : Preparation of a 3-chloro-5-(trifluoromethvl)-2-ethylamine-pyridinvl<br>
A two-necked round bottom flask equipped with a magnetic bar, a thermometer and a reflux condenser was charged with the above crude 3-chloro-5-(trifluoromethyl)-2-ethylacetamide-pyridinyl (22.2 mMol), water (50 ml), HCI 37% (4.3 g, 5 equiv.). The solution was refluxed 5 hours. The aqueous phase was washed 3 times with CH2Cl2 (3 X 20 ml) at room temperature. The aqueous phase was titrated by HPLC. The titrated yield in solution is 92%. Mass spectrum analysis : 224 DA, MJ-T 225.<br>
Under these conditions, the global yield to prepare the 2-ethylaminopyridyl derivative starting from 2-methylcyanopyridine derivative (step 2 and step 3) is 65%, which is acceptable at an industrial scale..<br>
Comparative experiments by using the process disclosed in patent application WO 2004/016088 have been conducted:<br>
Preparation of a 3-chloro-5-(trifluoromethvl)-2-ethvlamine-pyridinvl starting from 3-chloro-5-(trifluoromethvl)-2-methvlcvanopyridine according to the process disclosed in WO 2004/016088<br>
A hydrogenation reactor was charged with 3-chloro-5-trifluoromethyl-2-methylcyano pyridine (1.5g, 6.72 mMol), Pd/C 5%, AcOH (7ml). The reactor was stirred under 6 bars of hydrogen at 20Â°C for 15 hours. The hydrogen was removed, the catalyst filtrated out and the solvent was evaporated. 1.4 g of crude desired product was obtained. Titrated yield by HPLC is 19%. Mass spectrum analysis : 224 DA, MH+ 225.<br>
Under these conditions, the global yield to prepare the 2-ethylaminopyridyl derivative starting from 2-methylcyanopyridine derivative is only 19%, which is not acceptable at an industrial scale.<br>
Above described step 3 may be completed by a further step for preparing N-{2-[3-chloro-5-(trifluoromethyl)-2-pyridinyl]ethyl}-2-trifluoromethylbenzamide which is known as fungicide :<br>
Step 4 : Preparation of a N-{2-[3-chloro-5-(trinuoromethvl)-2-pvridinvllethyl}-2-trifluoromethvlbenzamide<br>
A two-necked round bottom flask equipped with a magnetic bar, a thermometer and a reflux condenser was charged with the above aqueous solution, the 2-trifluoromethyl benzoic acid chloride (1.2 eq.) solution in THF (80 ml) was added followed by NaOH aqueous 2N until pH is 8. After 1 hour, the aqueous phase was extracted with iPraO (40 ml), the organic phases were mixed, washed with HC] aqueous IN (2X 40 ml) and water (40 ml). The organic phase was titrated by HPLC. The titrated yield in solution was 90%.<br>
Heptane (70 ml) was added to the organic solution and the THF and iPraO were distilled to obtain precipitation of the desired compound. After filtration, the cake was washed with heptane/CH2Cl2 (90/10) and dried. The isolated yield was 80%.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
