The invention will be more fully understood in the light of the following description of several specific embodiments.<br>

Fig 7 is a graphical illustration of the performars of the rotor of the first embodiment when compared to the performance of a widely marketed conventional domestic exhaust fan blade.<br>
Detailed Description of Several Embodiments<br>
The first embodiment shown In the drawings comprises a rotor which can be utilised as a fan blade in order to induce an air flow and in particular which can be used as the fan blade of an exhaust fan.<br>
As shown in the drawings, the rotor comprises a hub (12) which supports a set of three radial blades (11). The hub (12) is formed with a central aperture (13) which Is adapted to be mounted to a rotatable shaft which comprises, in the case of a fan blade intended to induce fluid flow, a drive shaft driven from a suitable motor. Each of the blades are formed with an internal reactive face (14) which is of a concave configuration and which has a three dimensional curvature whereby the curvature in each dimension is about an axis which is radial to the central axis of the rotor, an axis which is tangential to the central axis of the rotor and an axis which is coincidental or parallel tb the centra! axis of the rotor. In each case the curvature is in accordance with a logarithmic curve conforming to the Golden Section. As a result, the blades (11) jointly define a generally concave face of the rotor.<br>
In addition, each blade has a remote reactive face (15) which is remote from the reactive face (14) and which also has a three dimensional curvature of a convex nature whereby the cun/ature in each dimension conforms with a logarithmic curve according to the Golden Section, and whereby the curvature in each dimension is of the same form as the curvature of the reactive face (14) In each dimension. As<br><br>
a resutic. the remote faces (15) jointly define a generally convex surface of the<br>
rotor.<br>
Each blacte (11) is formed with a pair of generally radial edges (16) and (17) which due to the curvature of the blade are of differing lengths whereby one edge (16) has a greater length than the other edge (17). In addition, each edge has a curvature which conforms to a logarithmic curve conforming to the Golden Section.<br>
The 1an blade according to the first embodiment Is intended to be used in an exhaosttan to induce a flow of air from one space to another whereby with rotation of the fan blade such that the one edge (16) forms the leading edge of each blade, fluid flow will be induced past the fan blade from the convex face to the concave face. Because of the curvature of the reactive face of each of the radial blades of the embodiment, the fan blade induces a vortical fluid flow in the air both as it approaches the fan blade and as it exhausts from the fan blade as illustrated at Rgure 6.<br>
It has beer: fccHid that in use of the first embodiment the rotation of tbe rotor generates a fluid flow through the rotor in which the flowing fluid maintains its own inertia and if the rotor is stopped the fluid flow will continue through the rotor for a period of time because of such inertia. It is believed that this is at least in part due to the circumstance that ttie use of the rotor of the first embodiment results in the generation of a fluid flow in which the pathway for the fluid flow though the rotor {as distinct from conventional rotors) is constant in its geometry from a position in advance of the entry to the rotor to a position beyond the exit from the rotor.<br>
Examples of the First Embodiment<br>
A. An example of a fan blade according to the first embodiment has been constructed and used to replace the existing blade of an exhaust fan marketed under the name NUTONE by Nortec Inc. (exhaust fan model 686).  The existing<br><br>
fan blade of that exhaust fan comprises a five bladed fan where the blades have a conventional configuration. The exhaust fan incorporating the existing fan blade was tested both with and without flow straightening means which was provided with the fan. In addition, the exhaust fan was modified by replacing the existing Ian blade with a fan blade according to the embodiment and the modified exhaust fan was tested both with and without the conventional flow straightener. Figure 7 illustrates the performance of each of the fan blades in a graphical form where the efficiency of the conventional exhaust fan and the modified exhaust fan is plotted against the volume flow rate generated by each exhaust fan where measures of the efficiency of the fan and the flow rate were determined at 2000 rpm, 3000 rpm, 3250 rpm and 4000 rpm.<br><br>
As a result of utilisation of the rotor according to the first embodiment, the efficiency of the fan was increased significantly and the flow rate generated from the fan also increased dramatically.<br>
B. In addition, a fan blade according to the first embodiment was utilised in an automotive cooling fan marketed under the name "Davies, Craig" by a company named Davies, Craig {model DCSL 10) as a result the following figures were determined.<br><br><br>
A second embodiment of the invention comprises a rotor of a similar form to that of the first embodiment where the other edge (17) comprises the leading edge of the rotor which is caused to rotate in the   opposite direction to the rotor of the first<br>
embodiment.<br>
A third embodiment of the invention comprises a rotor of a similar form to^that of the first embodiment which is used as a propeller for use with watercraft. It is envisaged that the use of the third embodiment will enable the elimination or at least a reduction in the need for a surrounding shroud or duct which is often required with conventional propellers to improve their performance.<br>
According to a fourth embodiment of the invention a rotor of a similar form to that of the first embodiment is used as the impeller of a fluid mixer.<br>
According to a fifth embodiment of the invention a rotor of a similar form to that of the first embodiment is used as the impeller of a fluid pump.<br>
According to a sixth embodiment of the invention a rotor of a similar form to that of the first embodiment is used as the impeller of a compressor.<br><br>
According to a seventh embodiment of the invention a rotor of a similar form to that of the first embodiment is used as the turbine blade of a turbine.<br>
As a result of testing of rotors according to at least some of the embodiments described above It appears that the blades of the rotor uniquely replicates and match the lines of vorticity of a singular vortex. As a result the rotor creates a homogeneous fluid flow structure which is then aided In its stability by the inertia of the resultant fluid field (i.e. the rotor creates a single vortex)- Once rotating this singular vortex is both gyroscopic in nature and has a high rotating Inertia. Conventional propellers do not achieve this and if they are suddenly stopped the propeller interferes with the fluid flow pattern It has created In the body of fluid. In comparison testing has shown that rotors according to the embodiment do not demonstrate such interference with the fluid flow when they are stopped and that the fluid follow will continue until the angular momentum induced in the fluid fades.<br>

It should be appreciated that the scope of the present Invention need not be limited to the particular scope of the embodiment described atiove.<br><br><br>
