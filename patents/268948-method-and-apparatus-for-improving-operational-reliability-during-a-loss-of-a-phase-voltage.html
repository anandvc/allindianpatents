METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR IMPROVING OPERATIONAL RELIABILITY<br>
DURING A LOSS OF A PHASE VOLTAGE<br>
Cross Reference To Related Application<br>
This application claims the priority of U.S. provisional patent application<br>
Ser. No. 60/680,719 filed on May 13, 2005, entitled "A METHOD FOR<br>
IMPROVING OPERATIONAL RELIABILITY DURING A LOSS OF SINGLE<br>
PHASE VOLTAGE" the contents of which are relied upon and incorporated herein<br>
by reference in their entirety, and the benefit of priority under 35 U.S.C. 119(e) is<br>
hereby claimed.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0001]	The present invention relates to a multi-phase power system and in<br>
particular to the reliability of that system during a loss of phase voltage.<br>
[0002]	As widely known in the art, many protective devices, such as relays,<br>
circuit breakers, various types of monitoring, supervising and fault detection units,<br>
are used in power system. One basic task of these devices is to allow electrical<br>
power to be distributed in a reliable manner and to adequately protect either the<br>
transmission lines and the loads or equipments connected therewith, e.g.<br>
generators, motors, from hazardous conditions which could lead to malfunction,<br>
severe damage, failure, etc.<br>
[0003]	Often,  the protection of power system  elements  is based  on<br>
accurate measurement of three-phase voltages in order to provide reliable fault<br>
detection and breaker operations and thus minimize power system disruptions. In<br>
these cases, incorrectly measuring one or more of the three-phase voltages by a<br>
protective unit may result in technical shortcomings, e.g. erroneous trips (breaker<br>
operations) and/or clearing more of the power system than desired.<br>
[0004]	For example a  common failure that causes  incorrect voltage<br>
measurement is when there is a downed line, or due to an equipment failure in an<br>
end-user's facility, or when one or more fuses protecting a three-phase voltage<br>
transformer (VT) secondary circuit blow. In the latter case, protective relays<br>
connected to that secondary circuit would measure zero voltage if a secondary<br>
phase is isolated (only phase-to-ground connections) or there exist a non-zero<br>
coupled value if there are phase-to-phase connections in the secondary circuit.<br><br>
WO 2006/124743	PCT/US2006/018666<br>
2<br>
E20050140<br>
Conditions, other than blown fuses, may also occur where one or more secondary<br>
phase voltages are unintentionally removed from the protective relay.<br>
[0005]	In the electrical power system industry operating in this abnormal<br>
state may for example be referred to as "single-phasing", or as fuse failure, or as<br>
"loss-of-potential (LOP)", or more commonly as "loss-of-voltage (LOV)" and this<br>
last definition ("LOV") will be used hereinafter to refer to the loss of voltage in a<br>
single phase.<br>
[0006]	It is clear that when an LOV state occurs, adequate control of<br>
voltage dependent measuring units need to be carried out so as to reduce<br>
potential detrimental effects on the whole power system and/ or on the various<br>
pieces of equipment.<br>
[0007]	For example, with protection measuring units, such as distance and<br>
impedance units, e.g. distance relays, functioning is based on calculating the<br>
impedance seen by the units themselves; since the impedance measured is<br>
directly dependent on the voltage(s). Thus an LOV condition will adversely affect<br>
obtaining correct measurements and therefore missing one or more phase<br>
voltages will lead to misoperations, such as untimely tripping.<br>
[0008]	The same considerations apply also in the case of the so-called<br>
directional units, i.e. protection measuring devices that determine the direction of<br>
the current flow in an AC circuit and are used to supervise for example an<br>
overcurrent relay in order to let it trip only in the desired direction. These<br>
directional units can perform their supervision task by comparing the angular<br>
relationship between the current in the protected circuit and an independent<br>
voltage source. Since the current can vary significantly for various types of faults,<br>
in order to determine directionality the independent voltage may be used as a<br>
reference or polarizing quantity. This reference voltage may be not correct during<br>
an LOV state, and hence the directional units will not be able to provide the<br>
required supervision and may contribute to a misoperation.<br>
[0009]	A further example of the negative impact that the occurrence of an<br>
LOV state may have on power line protection is the operation of a recloser. A<br>
recloser opens and closes multiple times when a fault condition exists in an<br>
attempt to clear the fault. Should the fault condition continue to exist, the recloser<br>
opens and remains open until reset manually. The recloser enters a "lock out"<br><br>
WO 2006/124743	PCT/US2006/018666<br>
3<br>
E20050140<br>
state when this occurs. Automatic reclosing requires synchronization or<br>
comparison of voltage on each side of an open line circuit breaker. These<br>
comparisons are often accomplished by comparing the voltage from one phase<br>
VT on each side of the open breaker. If an LOV condition exists on either VT,<br>
reclosing may operate incorrectly and prevent automatic system restoration,<br>
cause a line outage, or possibly cause circuit breaker damage. Thus, the location<br>
of the LOV may impact the protection functions provided by the recloser.<br>
[0010]	In the past, in order to improve reliability under an LOV state,<br>
various solutions have been devised varying depending on several aspects of the<br>
specific applications, such as type, number and technology of protecting systems,<br>
available options provided by the units, architecture of the power system, etc.<br>
These known solutions, even though providing some improvements may not be<br>
entirely satisfactory as they may, when an LOV condition occurs, either give rise<br>
to false trip or not allow for local fault clearing, or require the use of costly<br>
redundant protection system.<br>
[0011]	Thus it is desirable to provide a solution which improves operational<br>
reliability during an LOV state.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0012]	In accordance with the present invention, a method for improving<br>
operational reliability during a loss of a phase voltage in a multi-phase power<br>
system, in particular a three-phase power line, is provided. In accordance with the<br>
method, when one of the phases is under an LOV state, a fictitious voltage<br>
representative of this LOV state phase is calculated and a reference polarizing<br>
voltage is computed suitable for any protection unit associated with the power<br>
system. The invention also provides a multi-phase power system, such as a three-<br>
phase power line, for allowing operational reliability during a loss of a phase<br>
voltage (LOV), comprising a computing device having therein program code<br>
usable by the computing device itself, wherein the program code comprises code<br>
configured to: identify the phase which is in an LOV state; calculate a fictitious<br>
voltage representative of the voltage of said phase in an LOV state; and calculate a<br>
reference polarizing voltage. Further, the present invention also provides a<br>
computer program product for allowing reliable operation during a loss of a phase<br><br>

voltage (LOV) in a multi-phase power system, wherein the computer program<br>
product comprises computer usable program code which is configured to: identify<br>
the phase which is in an LOV state; then to calculate a fictitious voltage<br>
representative of the voltage of said phase in an LOV state; and finally to calculate<br>
a reference polarizing voltage.<br>

claims, and accompanying drawings where:<br>
Fig. 1 illustrates an example of a power system wherein a three-phase<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF ILLUSTRATIVE EMBODIMENTS<br>
[0014]	It should be noted that in order to clearly and concisely disclose the<br>
present invention, the drawings may not necessarily be to scale and certain<br>
features of the invention may be shown in somewhat schematic form.<br>
[0015]	In the following description and illustrative examples, the method<br>
according to the present invention is described by making particular reference to<br>
its functioning with directional protection units without intending in any way to limit<br>
its scope and potential field of application.<br>
[0016]	Fig. 1 illustrates a power system apparatus, globally indicated with<br>
reference number 1, wherein a primary three-phase power line (or bus) 2 is<br>
operatively connected to a protective device 3, preferably a computing device.<br>
Such a protective computing device 3 can be constituted for example by any<br>
suitable electronic relay.<br>
[0017]	The protective relay 3 comprises a microprocessor unit 4 with a<br>
program code which is embedded therein and is suitable to carry out the method<br>
of the present invention, and a memory unit 5 which can be directly incorporated<br><br>
WO 2006/124743	PCT/US2006/018666<br>
5<br>
E20050140<br>
within or operatively connected with the microprocessor unit 4 itself. The<br>
protective relay 3 is operativeiy connected to the phases of the power line, i.e.<br>
phase A, phase B and phase C, through voltage transformers (VT) that step down<br>
the primary system quantities to values that enable practical and safe<br>
implementation of the relay 3 itself. Some equivalent alternatives may be adopted<br>
for the connection, for example current transformers can be used in addition with<br>
or in alternative to voltage transformers VT. The secondary system circuit<br>
indicated at 6, which is normally used by protective devices, such as the relay 3,<br>
for their measures and appropriate operations, is suitably fused by means of<br>
secondary circuit fuses 7 in order to protect the voltage transformer secondary<br>
winding and circuit.<br>
[0018]	Referring now also to Fig. 2, the relay 3 receives the voltage signals<br>
10 from the phases and, under normal operating conditions, i.e. an LOV state is<br>
not occurring, the microprocessor unit 4 computes at block 11 the respective<br>
voltage values (VA for phase A, VB for phase B, Vc for phase C). These values are<br>
recorded in the memory unit 5 and are continuously updated by repetitive<br>
calculations.<br>
[0019]	When an LOV state occurs on one phase, for example because a<br>
fuse 7 blows due to a fault on the secondary circuit 6, the relay 3 through its<br>
microprocessor unit 4 first identifies (block 12) which phase is under an LOV-<br>
state. One possible manner suitable for the identification of the phase under an<br>
LOV-state is disclosed for example in US patent 5,883,578 whose disclosure is<br>
fully incorporated herein by reference.<br>
[0020]	Once   the   phase   under   an   LOV   state   is   identified,   the<br>
microprocessor unit 4 alarms and calculates (at block 13 for phase A, at block 14<br>
for phase B, at block 15 for phase C) a fictitious voltage which is representative of<br>
the voltage of the phase in an LOV state. The fictitious voltage is recorded (block<br>
16) in the memory unit 5 and is continuously updated by repetitive calculations.<br>
[0021]	Then, a reference polarizing voltage is calculated. This reference<br>
polarizing voltage can be used by the relay 3 and its incorporated logic/functions<br>
or it can be provided to any protection unit operatively associated with or<br>
incorporated in the multi-phase power system, so as to allow an improved<br>
operation reliability under some operating conditions, namely occurrence of a fault<br><br>
WO 2006/124743	PCT/US2006/018666<br>

E20050140<br>
on one of the other phases, e.g. either phase A or C, which are not subject to a<br>
LOV state. Suitable protection units can be for example a unit for monitoring,<br>
supervising, detecting, tripping etc.<br>
[0022]	In the method according to the invention, the step of calculating said<br>
reference polarizing voltage can be carried out either by means of zero voltage<br>
sequence calculations or of negative voltage sequence calculations, and in<br>
particular the following equations can be used:<br><br>
where a is a complex operator and VA, VB and Vc are pre-fault<br>
voltages during an LOV state and with the assumption that with a perfectly<br>
balanced three-phase system Vo (zero sequence) and V2 (negative sequence) are<br>
equal to zero.<br>
[0023]	For perfectly balanced systems the results using either the zero or<br>
the negative sequence voltage equation would be substantially equal; however,<br>
there might be some differences if some unbalance exists. In these cases, a<br>
purposive selection can be done; for example, the voltage of the lost phase can<br>
be preferably calculated by using the zero sequence equation, e.g. for zero<br>
sequence directional polarization, and the computation using the negative<br>
sequence equation could be preferably used, e.g. for negative sequence<br>
directional polarization.<br>
[0024]	Hence, according to the method of the present invention, when an<br>
LOV state occurs on a phase, the above mentioned fictitious voltage<br>
representative of the LOV-state phase (VA1 when the LOV is on phase A, or VB'<br>
when the LOV is on phase B, or Vc when the LOV is on phase C) is calculated<br>
based on the recorded voltages (VA and VB when the LOV is on phase C, or VA<br>
and Vc when the LOV is on phase B, or VB and Vc when the LOV is on phase A)<br>
of the other phases in a non-LOV state; in particular the following equations are<br>
used for these calculations:<br><br>
WO 2006/124743	PCT/US2006/018666<br>
7<br>
E20050140<br>
LOV on Phase A<br><br>
LOV on Phase B<br><br>
LOV on Phase C<br><br>
[0025]	The calculated fictitious representative voltage(s) (VA1, or VB', or Vc)<br>
are advantageously recorded in the memory unit 5 (block 16 of Fig. 2) and<br>
continuously updated.<br>
[0026]	Preferably, it is assumed that there is no significant phase angle<br>
shift for single-line-to-ground-faults of the non-faulted phase voltages between the<br>
pre-fault and fault states. This is a function of system grounding and is expected<br>
on the effectively grounded transmission systems.<br>
[0027]	Therefore, during an LOV state with a fault occurring on one of the<br>
healthy phases, i.e. not in a LOV state, the reference polarizing voltage is computed<br>
(block 17 of Fig. 2) on the basis of the calculated fictitious voltage (VA', or VB1, or<br>
Vc) representative of the LOV-state phase and of the voltages measured on the<br>
other healthy phases during the fault. In particular the appropriate reference<br>
polarizing voltage may be computed as follows:<br>
LOV on phase A, fault on phases B or C<br><br><br>
WO 2006/124743	PCT/US2006/018666<br>
8<br>
E20050140<br>
LOV on phase B, fault on phases A or C<br><br>
LOV on phase C, fault on phases A or B<br><br>
where Va, Vb and Vc are the respective healthy phase voltages during the fault<br>
and VA', VB' and Vc' are the respective computed pre-fault and fault phase<br>
memory voltages of the phase in the LOV state.<br>
[0028]	The method according to the invention can be helpful even in the<br>
worst condition where the LOV state condition and a fault condition occur both on<br>
the same phase. In this case, the measurement is significantly reduced or near<br>
zero and in the present method the fictitious LOV phase voltage is assumed equal<br>
to zero. As it will be demonstrated in more details in the example which follows,<br>
the standard calculation for 3Vo and 3V2 without the computed memory phase<br>
voltage will be still valid for the purpose of obtaining useful information about the<br>
direction of the fault.<br>
[0029]	Accordingly, for the conditions described directly above:<br>

LOV and fault on phase C:<br><br>
[0030]	There will be now described an example comparing the values<br>
registered in a practical test and those calculated according to the method of the<br>
present invention.<br>
[0031]	The following example is based on pre-fault and fault quantities<br>
recorded for a forward fault at a remote bus. The related fault oscillography is<br>
displayed in Figure 3 and the voltage and current secondary values are shown in<br>
Table A below.<br><br>

3V2		20.01	169		3I2		9.15		269<br>
As can be inferred from Table A and Figure 3, the fault can be identified as a<br>
single phase A-to-ground fault based on current values. However, there appears<br><br>

to be some involvement with phase C based on the current on phase C during the<br>
fault and the fact that the negative sequence current, 3I2, is considerably larger<br>
than the zero sequence current, 3l0, since the two sequence currents would<br>
normally be equal for a single phase-to-ground fault.<br>
[0032]	For this example, an LOV state will be applied to each phase by<br>
setting that phase voltage to zero. Then using the above equations, both the zero<br>
and negative sequence polarizing voltages used during the LOV period will be<br>
computed and compared with the original values recorded.<br>

[0034]	It can be observed that there is very little difference when the LOV<br>
state is on a non-faulted phase, B or C. When the fault occurs on the LOV phase<br>
A then the polarizing voltage magnitude is substantially greater, but the polarizing<br>
voltage angle, which is the quantity used for polarization, is still accurate enough<br>
to achieve proper directional sensing for this fault.<br>
[0035]	It is also noted that for this case the fault was not a true single<br>
phase-to-ground fault, but the analysis shows that correct operation for the LOV<br>
state will occur with this adaptive approach.<br>
[0036]	Hence,   as  evident from  the  above  example,  the  operational<br>
reliability of protection units can be significantly improved while protection is in an<br>
LOV state by using the method according to the invention.<br>
[0037]	Likewise, in order to compute ground distance measurement during<br>
a single-phase LOV state, the voltage on the lost phase of the secondary circuit<br>
can be calculated in the same manner as done for the directional units using the<br>
method according to the invention and in particular, the zero and negative<br>
sequence voltage equations.<br>
[0038]	For example,   in the  case  of cross-polarized  ground  distance<br>
measurement units, the operating principal is based on comparing the phase<br>
relationship of two phasor quantities, according to the following equations:<br><br>
WO 2006/124743	PCT/US2006/018666<br>
13<br>
E20050140<br><br>
Where<br>
V0P = Operating voltage<br>
VP0L = Polarizing voltage<br>
VXG = Faulted phase - to - ground voltage<br>
VYX = Cross Phase - to - phase voltage<br>
lx = Faulted phase current<br>
/o = Zero sequence current<br>
Z1, = Positive sequence line impedance<br>
Zo = Zero sequence line impedance<br>
Zc = Distance reach setting, ohms<br>
[0039]	Trip occurs when VOP leads VPOL.<br>
[0040]	It can be easily observed that the polarizing voltage VPOL will be in<br>
error if either of the two non-faulted phases is in an LOV state, and the distance<br>
unit would not operate accurately. In this case the reference polarizing voltage,<br>
VPOL, can be also computed according to the present method and in particular by<br>
using the LOV phase memory voltage, as per the following equations:<br>
LOV on Phase A<br><br>
LOV on Phase B<br><br>
LOV on Phase C<br><br>
WO 2006/124743	PCT/US2006/018666<br>
14<br>
E20050140<br><br>
[0041]	Thus, if the LOV state occurs on phase B and fault occurs on phase<br>
A or C, computation of the reference polarizing voltage is calculated based on the<br>
voltages Va and Vc recorded during the fault and on the memorized voltage VB.<br>
[0042]	It is obvious that the operating quantity, VOP, cannot be computed<br>
with the similar pre-fault memory voltage because it is dependent on the accurate<br>
measurement of the phase-to-ground fault voltage, VXG- In this case there are<br>
options that could be provided: block operation, force the unit to overreach,<br>
convert the unit to operate based on directional overcurrent with pre-set setting,<br>
etc.<br>
[0043]	Although the method of the present invention has been described<br>
with particular regard to directional units, it should be appreciated that it may be<br>
used with any other suitable voltage dependent protection unit, be it a measuring<br>
unit, or a detecting unit, or supervising unit, a tripping unit, etc. Further, it can be<br>
easily implemented with or within any suitable type or multi-phase power system<br>
or apparatus using a computing device, and as will be appreciated by one of skill<br>
in the art, it may be embodied as the method described, or as a system, or as a<br>
computer program product. Furthermore, the present invention may take the form<br>
of a computer program product on a computer-usable or computer-readable<br>
medium having computer-usable program code embodied in the medium. The<br>
computer-usable or computer-readable medium may be any medium that can<br>
contain, store, communicate, propagate, or transport the program for use by or in<br>
connection with the instruction execution system, apparatus, or device, etc. Non<br>
exhaustive examples of the computer-readable medium would include: a portable<br>
computer diskette, a hard disk, a random access memory (RAM), a read-only<br>
memory (ROM), an erasable programmable read-only memory (EPROM or Flash<br>
memory), an optical fiber, a portable compact disc read-only memory (CD-ROM),<br>
an optical storage device, a transmission media such as those supporting the<br>
Internet or an intranet, or a magnetic storage device. Computer program code for<br>
carrying out operations of the present invention may be written in any suitable<br><br>

Java, Smalltalk, C++ or the like, or may also be written in more conventional<br>
procedural programming languages, such as the "C" programming language.<br>
