The invention relates to a sealing for a door of a cooling—or freezing equipment or equivalent, with a sealing head and a seal base arranged sidewise shifted to sealing head, fixed over walling combined with it in a back cut adapting slat of the door, which shows a entry wedge and which is equipped with hook type studs, with their free ends directed away from entry wedge, which support at the walling of adapting slot.<br>
For fixing of door sealing at doors of cooling-or freezing equipments, it is known, to provide a back cut holding slot at the internal lining forming the internal side of cooling-or freezing equipment, in which the seal base of door sealing is forced and with it the door sealing at the cooling-and freezing equipment is fixed.<br>
In order to reach at learct a sufficient counter acting holding force for the seal base in holding slot to opening force having an influence on the seal base during opening of equipment door, the holding slot is equipped not only with a tapered inlet opening producing back cut but also at the same time the seal base is provided with retaining studs which support in mounting condition of seal base in holding slot of their walling. In the designing of holding slot at one side, as well as of seal base on the  other  side, it is to be taken into consideration  that  the<br><br>
3.<br>
seal base at one side brings in relatively less force requirement in the holding slot, particularly in their strongly tapered entry opening, however at the same time the sealing base experiences within the adapting slot a sufficient hold in order to counter act the opening force appearing during opening process of cooling-or freezing equipment door which results in worst-case— incidence out of the demolition fore of magnet liner, assembled at sealing head of door sealing, from the housing of cooling—or freezing equipment and if required out of the low pressure developing in cooling chamber and having an influence on the doors. In order to fulfil the requirements in past it was proposed besides of one side strong bellying and on the bellying side sealing bases working together in the holding slot with a back cut, also multiple number barb type holding studs assembled, one after the other over the height of sealing base. While the one sided bellying seal base of sealing at the door distributes in fact a sufficient hold however it is mountable under large force consumption, the holding studs, the holding device of seal base in the adapter slot, working barb like, assembled at the first one do not distribute enough holding force to the seal base in the adapter slot.<br><br>
4.<br>
The assignment lies at the base of invention, to avoid the disadvantages of state of art in a sealing as per the generic term with simple actions and to propose a fixing for their seal base in the holding slot of a cooling-or freezing equipment door which guarantees to the extent possible a force saving fixing of sealing base, but at the same time a sufficient holding force of seal base in the adapter slot.<br>
This assignment is solved as per the invention through it, that the seal base shows at least three hook like, at least furthest going in holding studs located in holding slot in stress relieved condition, from which at least two holding studs mainly the same length near the inlet wedge assembled opposite to each other and together with this form a herring bone tooth like section, while the third holding stud is executed buttlike with their free end turned to the sealing head and shows a blunter intermediate angle to a vertical than both the other holding studs and that the holding stud prelaid to the butt type holding stud turns into an intermediate area provided both the holding studs.<br>
Through the structure of seal base as per the invention, this may also be pressed in without lubricating medium in the holding slot  provided  at the internal lining of a  cooling-or  freezing<br><br>
5.<br>
equipment door with force consumption representable in large commercial production not only because of their herring bone tooth like section, but also therefore, because from both the holding studs arranged one after the other, the pre laid holding stud in the proces of pressing in as a result of intermediate space saved free between the both holding studs fully clings to the body of seal base and with it the width of seal base in this process of forcing in the holding slot is maintained as less as possible. Through the elimination of lubricating medium during the assembly process of door sealing no undesirable dirt and after the assembly process no undesirable dirt to be removed appears at the body of cooling-or freezing equipment door, through which the assembly time is distinctly reduced and with it the manufacturing time of equipment door is favourably influenced. Through the assembly and structure of holding stud at one side, as well as through their stress relieved condition within the holding slot on the other side it is ensured that the seal base can counterpose a sufficient holding force to the opening forces appearing in opening process of cooling-and freezing equipment door in worst-case-incidence, there through the stress relieved position  of  holding studs these through their  position,  fixed<br><br>
6.<br>
over the intermediate angle to a vertical, for walling of holding slot can spread out at least furthest going their full retention force.<br>
Over and above that the butt type executed holding stud offers through their shortness avoiding a tilting away in case of a load of seal base a specially high, retention force necessary on the side of sealing head. Since the butt type holding stud is assembled at the seal base only at one side, it's righd structure does not obstruct the assembly process in any way.<br>
As per a preferred execution form of the object of invention, it is provided that the butt type holding stud and the holding stud prelaid to it show a cutting type edge, with which they cling to the walling of holding slot. Through here it is ensured in a specially simple way that no moisture — and air entry can take place over the adapter slot with the seal base assembled with it in the coaling chamber of a cooling—or freezing equipment.<br>
A specially higher holding force of seal base in the adpater slot at one side but at the same time also a specially low assembly force of seal base results, when as per a next advantageous design of object of invention it is provided, that the butt type<br><br>
7.<br>
holding stud shows an intermediate angle to the verticl which makes out mainly the double intermediate angle of holding stud prelaid to butt type holding stud.<br>
Specially favourable values for the holding force or rather the assembly force of seal base have resulted, when as per a further favourable execution form of object of invention it is provided that the intermediate angle of butt type holding stud to the vertical lies between 50cand 70; but amounts preferably to 62° , while the intermediate angle of holding stud to the vertical, prelaid to butt type holding stud lies between 25 and 40,° but preferably amount to 34°-<br>
As per a further preferred execution form a sealing, whose seal base is fixed in a back cut, one sided holding slot bellying in direction of sealing head it is provided that the butt type holding stud and the holding stud prelaid to it are allocated to the bellying side of holding slot in mounting condition of sealing.<br>
Through the allocation of butt type holding stud and of the holding stud preload to it to the one sided strongly bellying side  of  holding  slot, it results through  this  holding  stud,<br><br>
8.<br>
holding force for the seal base within the holding slot, which predominates distinctly in worst-case-incidence the opening force affecting the seal base appearing while opening the cooling-or freezing equipment door, so that the sealing is fixed continuously in the holding slot.<br>
Corresponding to a next preferred execution form of object of invention, it is provided that the holding stud prelaid to the butt type holding stud and the holding stud lying opposite to it are firmly executed at the stud base.<br>
Through the stiffening of holding studs at their stud base it is ensured, that the holding studs are capable to counterpose a sufficient moment of resistance to opening forces appearing in the opening process of cooling—or freezing equipment door and withi it achieved desired holding force for the sealing. Through the strengthening f folding of holding stud in consequence to the load introduced by the opening process of cooling equipment door on the door sealing is avoided- At the same time through the stiffening an increase of retention forces for the holding studs is reached, in order to swing back after the assembly process of seal base in the holding slot in it's positionally correct, the end of run position of guaranteeing the maximum retention force-<br>
7<br><br>
9-<br>
As specially purposeful in sense of a minimised assembly force and an optimised holding force for the seal base, it is designed when as per  a  next advantageous design of object  invention  it  is provided  that  the holding stud lying opposite  to  the  prelaid holding  stud shows an intermediate angle to the vertical  of  50° to 70 °, but possesses preferably an intermediate angle of 57 .<br>
As specially favourable for the assembly of seal base it has proved, when as per a further preferred execution form of object of invention it is provided that the holding stud lying opposite to the prelaid holding stud shows a rounding at it's free end with which it clings to the walling of holding slot.<br>
As per a last preferred execution form of object of invention it is provided, that the holding studs cling to the walling of holding slot with less prestress force-Through a such type of action it is avoided surely always, that air or rather moisture over the seal base assembled in the holding slot can enter from the external atmosphere in the plugged cooling chamber of a cooling—or freezing equipment through the cooling—or freezing equipment door.<br>
8<br><br>
10.<br>
The invention is explained in the following description with the help of an execution example represented simplified in the accompanying figures.<br>
The only figure shows section wise a heating insulated housing of a cooling equipment in area of it's cooling chamber opening border serving for coating of a magnet sealing, in horizontal section.<br>
As per the single figure, a cooling equipment 10 is simplified schematic representation sectionwise is represented in area of it's coaling chamber opening border., The cooling equipment 10 shows an insulating housing 11 with a heat insulation layer 12 which is assembled around the opening border of an access opening to a not represented cooling chamber under a steel plate covering serving an as magnetic armature.<br>
For covering of access opening at the heat insulating housing 11 a door 14, rested rotatable is put up at not shown door support, which shows an external lining 15 produced out of steel piatem, a heat insulation layer 16 and an internal lining 17 produced through chipless shaping of a plastic sheeting. The plastic internal lining 17 is equipped in the border area of door 14 with a circumferentially arranged holding slot 18 which  shows<br>
9<br><br>
11<br>
a constricted entry opening 19 and to it a post assembled holding area 20 which is executed extended for formation of a back section in relation to entry opening 19, in doing so the extension is executed asymetrically through a bellying directed to the border of door 14. The back cut holding slot 18 serves to fixing of a bellow type magnet sealing 21, which is closed door 14 supports at the not shown access opening to opening border of housing 11 surrounding a cooling chamber. For purpose of it's fixing in the holding slot 18 the magnet sealing 21 is provided with a seal base 22 to which at it's free end an entry edge is shown in extension of whose wedge flanks, two holding studs 24 and 25 lying opposite to each other are provided for formation of a herring bone type section, which form at seal base 22 thrust hook type lugs. Both the holding studs 24 and 25 show essentially the same length, in doing so holding stud 25 turned to the stronger bellying section of holding area 20 shows an edge 26, at which the holding stud 25 clings to the strongest bellying walling of holding area 20. The holding stud 25 to a vertical V encloses an intermediate angle of 34° which with the help of trial series has been established as favourable while the holding stud 24 to the vertical V encloses intermediate angle determined from trial series with 57° . Both the holding studs 24<br>
10<br><br>
12.<br>
and 25 which within the holding area 20 are provided with fully stress relieved arrangement are executed strengthened at their stud base for improvement of their internal rigidity and with it their life span. In the distance S over the holding stud 25, on the side of stronger be 1 lying section of holding area 20 a;: further hook like holding stud 27 is provided which is executed butt like and which encloses to the vertical V an intermediate angle V of 62° representing favourable out of trial series. The butt type holding stud 27 in relation to both the holding studs 24 and 25 is executed short and shows at their free end a cutting type edge 28 with which tht holding stud 27 at the walling of holding slot 20 1ies in transfer area of entry opening 19 to holding area 20. The distance  of butt type holding stud 27 over the stud base of holding stud 25 is determined such that the part of holding stud 25 capable of swinging at the entry process of entry wedge 23, turns into the entry opening 19 below the butt type holding stud 27 and with it can cling to the external side of sealing base wal1ing 22 for minimising sealing base width. The sealing base 22 is combined over bellow like executed walls 29 and 30 elastically with a sealing head 31 shifted side wise around  the  mass  X,  which shows a hose  type  holding  32  for<br><br>
13.<br>
bringing in permanent magnet liner 33, which in closed condition of door 14 stick magnetically to the steel plate covering 13 serving as magnetic armature.<br>
Through the assembly of holding studs 24, 25 and 27 to the vertical V at one side in combination with formation and shaping of holding studs, at the other side capable of being assembled with less force consumption and at the same time with disengaging holding force at the door, a maintained door sealing is prepared.<br><br>
