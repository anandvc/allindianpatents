DESCRIPTION<br>
POLYAMIDE, POLYAMIDE COMPOSITION, AND METHOD FOR<br>
PRODUCING POLYAMIDE<br>
Technical Field<br>
[0001]<br>
The present invention relates to a polyamide, a<br>
polyamide composition, and a method for producing<br>
polyamide.<br>
Background Art<br>
[0002]<br>
Polyamides represented by polyamide 6 and polyamide<br>
66 (hereinafter, sometimes referred to as "PA6" and<br>
"PA66", respectively) and the like have excellent molding<br>
processability, mechanical properties, or chemical<br>
resistance. Therefore, polyamides are widely used as a<br>
material for various parts, such as for automobiles,<br>
electric and electronic parts, industrial materials, and<br>
daily and household articles.<br>
[0003]<br>
In the automotive industry, as an environmental<br>
measure, there is a need to lighten the weight of the<br>
automobile body by using a metal substitute in order to<br>
reduce exhaust gases. To respond to this need,<br>
polyamides are being increasingly used for exterior<br><br><br>
materials, interior materials and the like. Further, the<br>
level of the properties required for polyamide materials,<br>
such as heat resistance, strength, and appearance, is<br>
dramatically increasing. However, the temperature in the<br>
engine room is also tending to increase, so that the need<br>
to increase the heat resistance of polyamide materials is<br>
growing stronger.<br>
Further, in the electric and electronics industry,<br>
such as household appliances, there is a need for<br>
increased heat resistance for polyamide materials which<br>
are capable of withstanding the increased melting point<br>
of the solder required for lead-free solder for using<br>
surface mounting technology (SMT) .<br>
PA6 and PA66 polyamides are unable to satisfy these<br>
requirements in terms of heat resistance, since their<br>
melting point is low.<br>
[0004]<br>
To resolve the above-described problems with<br>
conventional polyamides such as PA6 and PA66, a high-<br>
melting-point polyamide has been proposed. Specifically,<br>
a polyamide formed from terephthalic acid and<br>
hexamethylenediamine (hereinafter, sometimes referred to<br>
as "PA6T") has been proposed.<br>
However, PA6T is a high-melting-point polyamide<br>
having a melting point of about 370°C. Therefore, even<br>
if a molded product is obtained by melt kneading,<br>
pyrolysis of the polyamide is severe, which makes it<br><br><br>
difficult to obtain a molded product having sufficient<br>
properties.<br>
[0005]<br>
To resolve the above-described problem with PA6T, a<br>
high-melting-point semi-aromatic polyamide (hereinafter,<br>
sometimes referred to as "6T-based copolyamide") and the<br>
like comprising terephthalic acid and a<br>
hexamethylenediamine as main components has been proposed.<br>
This high-melting-point semi-aromatic polyamide has a<br>
melting point lowered to about 220 to 340°C by<br>
copolymerizing an aliphatic polyamide, such as PA6 and<br>
PA66, and the amorphous aromatic polyamide formed from<br>
hexamethylendiamine and isophthalic acid (hereinafter,<br>
sometimes referred to as "PA6I) and the like with PA6T.<br>
[0006]<br>
As a 6T-based copolyamide, Patent Document 1<br>
describes an aromatic polyamide (hereinafter, sometimes<br>
referred to as "PA6T/2MPDT) which is formed from an<br>
aromatic dicarboxylic acid and an aliphatic diamine, in<br>
which the aliphatic diamine is a mixture of<br>
hexamethylenediamine and 2-methylpentamethylenediamine.<br>
[0007]<br>
Further, in contrast to an semi-aromatic polyamide<br>
formed from an aromatic dicarboxylic acid and an<br>
aliphatic diamine, a high-melting-point aliphatic<br>
polyamide (hereinafter, sometimes referred to as "PA4 6")<br>
formed from adipic acid and tetramethylenediamine, and an<br><br><br>
alicyclic polyamide formed from an alicyclic dicarboxylic<br>
acid and an aliphatic diamine, and the like have been<br>
proposed.<br>
[0008]<br>
Patent Documents 2 and 3 describe a semi-alicyclic<br>
polyamide (hereinafter, sometimes referred to as "PA6C<br>
copolyamide") which is formed from an alicyclic polyamide<br>
(hereinafter, sometimes referred to as "PA6C") formed<br>
from 1,4-cyclohexanedicarboxylic acid and<br>
hexamethylenediamine, and another polyamide.<br>
Patent Document 2 describes that electric and<br>
electronic parts formed from a semi-alicyclic polyamide<br>
blended with 1 to 40% of 1,4-cyclohexanedicarboxylic acid<br>
as a dicarboxylic acid unit have improved solder heat<br>
resistance. Patent Document 3 describes that for<br>
automobile components, fluidity, toughness and the like<br>
are excellent.<br>
[0009]<br>
In addition, Patent Document 4 describes that a<br>
polyamide formed from a dicarboxylic acid unit comprising<br>
1,4-cyclohexanedicarboxylic acid and a diamine unit<br>
comprising 2-methyl-1,8-octanediamine has excellent light<br>
fastness, toughness, moldability, low weight, heat<br>
resistance and the like. Moreover, as a production<br>
method for such a polyamide, Patent Document 4 describes<br>
that a polyamide having a melting point of 311°C is<br>
produced by reacting 1,4-cyclohexanedicarboxylic acid and<br><br><br>
1, 9-nonanediamine at 230°C or less to produce a<br>
prepolymer, which is then subjected to solid phase<br>
polymerization at 230°C.<br>
Further, Patent Document 5 describes that a<br>
polyamide using 1,4-cyclohexanedicarboxylic acid having a<br>
trans/cis ratio of from 50/50 to 97/3 as a raw material<br>
has excellent heat resistance, low water absorbance, and<br>
light fastness.<br>

Disclosure of the Invention<br>
Problems to be Solved by the Invention<br>
[0011]<br>
Although 6T-based copolyamides certainly have<br>
properties such as low water absorbance, high heat<br>
resistance, and high chemical resistance, their fluidity<br>
is low, and their moldability and the surface appearance<br>
of the molded product is insufficient. In addition,<br>
their toughness and light fastness is poor. Consequently,<br><br><br>
there is a need for improvement for applications which<br>
require a good molded product appearance, such as an<br>
exterior component, or which are exposed to sunlight and<br>
the like. Moreover, 6T-based copolyamides have a large<br>
specific weight, so that there is a need for improvement<br>
in terms of reducing weight as well.<br>
[0012]<br>
Although the PA6/2MPDt described in Patent Document<br>
1 can partially improve on the problems of conventional<br>
PA6T copolymers, the level of improvement in terms of<br>
fluidity, moldability, toughness molded product surface<br>
appearance, and light fastness is insufficient.<br>
[0013]<br>
Although PA4 6 has good heat resistance and<br>
moldability, PA4 6 suffers from the problems of high water<br>
absorbance. Further, the dimensional change and<br>
deterioration in mechanical properties due to water<br>
absorbance is very large. Thus, in some cases PA46<br>
cannot satisfy the dimensional change requirement<br>
required for automobile applications.<br>
[0014]<br>
The PA6C copolyamide described in Patent Documents 2<br>
and 3 also suffers from problems such as having a high<br>
water absorbance and insufficient fluidity.<br>
For the polyamides described in Patent Documents 4<br>
and 5 too, the improvement in terms of toughness,<br>
rigidity, and fluidity is insufficient.<br><br><br>
[0015]<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide<br>
a polyamide having a high melting point, which has<br>
excellent heat resistance, fluidity, toughness, low water<br>
absorbance, and rigidity.<br>

Advantages of the Invention<br>
[0018]<br><br><br>
According to the present invention, a high-melting-<br>
point polyamide can be provided, which has excellent heat<br>
resistance, fluidity, toughness, low water absorbance,<br>
and rigidity.<br>
Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
[0019]<br>
A best mode for carrying out the present invention<br>
(hereinafter referred to as "the present embodiment") is<br>
described below in more detail. However, the present<br>
invention is not limited to the following embodiment, and<br>
can be variously modified within the scope of the intent<br>
of the invention.<br>
[0020]<br>
Polyamide<br>
The polyamide according to the present embodiment is<br>
a polyamide obtained by polymerizing the following (a)<br>
and (b):<br>
an (a) dicarboxylic acid comprising at least 50 mol%<br>
of an alicyclic dicarboxylic acid, and<br>
a (b) diamine comprising at least 50 mol% of a<br>
diamine having a substituent branched from a main chain.<br>
In the present embodiment, "polyamide" means a<br>
polymer which has an amide (-NHC0-) bond in a main chain.<br>
[0021]<br>
(a) Dicarboxylic acid<br><br><br>
The (a) dicarboxylic acid used in the present<br>
embodiment comprises at least 50 mol% of an alicyclic<br>
dicarboxylic acid.<br>
By comprising at least 50 mol% of the alicyclic<br>
dicarboxylic acid as the (a) dicarboxylic acid, the<br>
polyamide can be obtained which simultaneously satisfies<br>
heat resistance, fluidity, toughness, low water<br>
absorbance, rigidity and the like.<br>
[0022]<br>
Examples of the (a-1) alicyclic dicarboxylic acid<br>
(also referred to as cycloaliphatic dicarboxylic acid)<br>
include alicyclic dicarboxylic acids having an alicyclic<br>
structure with 3 to 10 carbon atoms, and preferably 5 to<br>
10 carbon atoms, such as 1,4-cyclohexanedicarboxylic acid,<br>
1,3-cyclohexanedicarboxylic acid, and 1,3-<br>
cyclopentanedicarboxylic acid. The alicyclic<br>
dicarboxylic acid may optionally have a substituent.<br>
[0023]<br>
In the present embodiment, examples of the<br>
substituent include an alkyl group having 1 to 4 carbon<br>
atoms, such as a methyl group, an ethyl group, a n-propyl<br>
group, an isopropyl group, a n-butyl group, an isobutyl<br>
group, and a tert-butyl group.<br>
[0024]<br>
From perspectives such as heat resistance, fluidity,<br>
and rigidity, 1,4-cyclohexanedicarboxylic acid is<br>
preferred as the alicyclic dicarboxylic acid.<br><br><br>
As the alicyclic dicarboxylic acid, one kind may be<br>
used, or two or more kinds may be used in combination.<br>
[0025]<br>
Alicyclic dicarboxylic acids have trans and cis<br>
geometric isomers.<br>
The alicyclic dicarboxylic acid used as a raw<br>
material monomer may be either a trans or a cis isomer.<br>
The alicyclic dicarboxylic acid may also be used as a<br>
mixture of trans and cis isomers in various ratios.<br>
Since alicyclic dicarboxylic acids isomerize in a<br>
fixed ratio at high temperatures, and the cis isomer has<br>
a higher water solubility than the trans isomer in an<br>
equivalent amount of salt with a diamine, as the raw<br>
material monomer, a trans isomer / cis isomer ratio is,<br>
based on molar ratio, preferably 50/50 to 0/100, more<br>
preferably 40/60 to 10/90, and still more preferably<br>
35/65 to 15/85.<br>
The alicyclic dicarboxylic acid trans isomer / cis<br>
isomer ratio (molar ratio) can be determined by liquid<br>
chromatography (HPLC) or NMR.<br>
[0026]<br>
Examples of an (a-2) dicarboxylic acid other than<br>
the alicyclic dicarboxylic acid in the (a) dicarboxylic<br>
acid used in the present embodiment include aliphatic<br>
dicarboxylic acids and aromatic dicarboxylic acids.<br>
[0027]<br><br><br>
Examples of the aliphatic dicarboxylic acid include<br>
straight-chain or branched saturated aliphatic<br>
dicarboxylic acids having 3 to 20 carbon atoms, such as<br>
malonic acid, dimethylmalonic acid, succinic acid, 2,2-<br>
dimethylsuccinic acid, 2,3-dimethylglutaric acid, 2,2-<br>
diethylsuccinic acid, 2,3-diethylglutaric acid, glutaric<br>
acid, 2,2-dimethylglutaric acid, adipic acid, 2-<br>
methyladipic acid, trimethyl adipic acid, pimelic acid,<br>
suberic acid, azelaic acid, sebacic acid, dodecanedioic<br>
acid, tetradecanedioic acid, hexadecanedioic acid,<br>
octadecanedioic acid, eicosane diacid, and diglycolic<br>
acid.<br>
[0028]<br>
Examples of the aromatic dicarboxylic acid include<br>
aromatic dicarboxylic acids, which are unsubstituted or<br>
substituted with various substituents, having 8 to 20<br>
carbon atoms, such as terephthalic acid, isophthalic acid,<br>
naphthalene dicarboxylic acid, 2-chloroterephthalic acid,<br>
2-methylterephthalic acid, 5-methylisophthalic acid, and<br>
5-sodium sulfoisophthalic acid.<br>
Examples of the various substituents include an<br>
alkyl group having 1 to 6 carbon atoms, an aryl group<br>
having 6 to 12 carbon atoms, an arylalkyl group having 7<br>
to 2 0 carbon atoms, a halogen group such as a chloro<br>
group or a bromo group, an alkylsilyl group having 3 to<br>
10 carbon atoms, and a sulfonic acid group or salt<br>
thereof, such as a sodium salt.<br><br><br>
[0029]<br>
As the dicarboxylic acid other than the alicyclic<br>
dicarboxylic acid, from perspectives such as heat<br>
resistance, fluidity, toughness, low water absorbance,<br>
and rigidity, an aliphatic dicarboxylic acid is preferred,<br>
and more preferred is an aliphatic dicarboxylic acid<br>
having 6 or more carbon atoms.<br>
Of these, from perspectives such as heat resistance<br>
and low water absorbance, an aliphatic dicarboxylic acid<br>
having 10 or more carbon atoms is preferred.<br>
Examples of the aliphatic dicarboxylic acids having<br>
10 or more carbon atoms include sebacic acid,<br>
dodecanedioic acid, tetradecanedioic acid,<br>
hexadecanedioic acid, octadecanedioic acid, and<br>
eicosanedioic acid.<br>
Of these, from perspectives such as heat resistance,<br>
sebacic acid and dodecanedioic acid are preferred.<br>
As the dicarboxylic acid other than the alicyclic<br>
dicarboxylic acid, one kind may be used, or two or more<br>
kinds may be used in combination.<br>
[0030]<br>
To the extent that the object of the present<br>
embodiment is not harmed, the (a) dicarboxylic acid may<br>
further include a trivalent or higher polyvalent<br>
carboxylic acid, such as trimellitic acid, trimesic acid,<br>
and pyromellitic acid.<br><br><br>
As the polyvalent carboxylic acid, one kind may be<br>
used, or two or more kinds may be used in combination.<br>
[0031]<br>
A ratio of the (a-1) alicyclic dicarboxylic acid in<br>
the (a) dicarboxylic acid is at least 50 mol%. The ratio<br>
of the alicyclic dicarboxylic acid is 50 to 100 mol%, and<br>
preferably 60 to 100%. By setting the ratio of the<br>
alicyclic dicarboxylic acid to be at least 50 mol%, the<br>
polyamide can be obtained which simultaneously satisfies<br>
heat resistance, fluidity, toughness, low water<br>
absorbance, rigidity and the like.<br>
A ratio of the (a-2) dicarboxylic acid other than<br>
the alicyclic dicarboxylic acid in the (a) dicarboxylic<br>
acid is 0 to 50 mol%, and preferably 0 to 40%.<br>
[0032]<br>
It is preferred that the (a-1) alicyclic<br>
dicarboxylic acid is 50.0 to 99.9 mol% and the (a-2)<br>
aliphatic dicarboxylic acid having 10 or more carbon<br>
atoms is 0.1 to 50.0 mol%. It is more preferred that the<br>
(a-1) alicyclic dicarboxylic acid is 60.0 to 90.0 mol%<br>
and the (a-2) aliphatic dicarboxylic acid having 10 or<br>
more carbon atoms is 10.0 to 40.0 mol%. It is still more<br>
preferred that the (a-1) alicyclic dicarboxylic acid is<br>
70.0 to 85.0 mol% and the (a-2) aliphatic dicarboxylic<br>
acid having 10 or more carbon atoms is 15.0 to 30.0 mol%.<br>
[0033]<br><br><br>
In the present embodiment, the (a) dicarboxylic acid<br>
is not limited to the compounds described above as<br>
dicarboxylic acids. The dicarboxylic acid may be a<br>

[0051]<br>
When polymerizing the polyamide from the (a)<br>
dicarboxylic acid and the (b) diamine, a known end-<br>
capping agent can be added for molecular weight<br>
regulation.<br>
Examples of the end-capping agent include<br>
monocarboxylic acids, monoamines, acid anhydrides such as<br>
phthalic anhydride, monoisocyanates, monoacid halides,<br>

thermal stability of the polyamide, monocarboxylic acids<br>
and monoamines are preferred.<br><br><br>
As the end-capping agent, one kind may be used, or<br>

[0052]<br>

[0054]<br>
Preferred combinations of the (a) dicarboxylic acid<br>
and (b) diamine include, but are not limited to, (a-1) at<br>
least 50 mol% or more of alicyclic dicarboxylic acid and<br>

By polymerizing these combinations as the polyamide<br>
components, a high-melting-point polyamide can be<br>
obtained which simultaneously satisfies heat resistance,<br>
fluidity, toughness, low water absorbance, and rigidity.<br>
[0055]<br>
In the polyamide according to the present embodiment,<br>
the alicyclic dicarboxylic acid structure exists as cis<br>
and trans geometric isomers.<br>
The trans isomer ratio of the alicyclic dicarboxylic<br>
acid structure in the polyamide represents the ratio of<br>
trans isomers based on the whole alicyclic dicarboxylic<br>
acid in the polyamide. The trans isomer ratio is<br>
preferably 50 to 85 mol%, more preferably 50 to 80 mol%,<br>
and still more preferably 60 to 80 mol%.<br><br><br>
As the (a-1) alicyclic dicarboxylic acid, it is<br>
preferred to use an alicyclic dicarboxylic acid having a<br>
trans/cis ratio (molar ratio) of 50/50 to 0/100. However,<br>
as the polyamide obtained by polymerization of the (a)<br>
dicarboxylic acid and (b) diamine, the trans isomer ratio<br>
is preferably 50 to 85 mol%.<br>
By setting the trans isomer ratio in the above-<br>
described range, in addition the characteristics of a<br>
high melting point and excellent toughness and rigidity,<br>
the polyamide has qualities which simultaneously satisfy<br>
rigidity during heating due to a high glass transition<br>
temperature, fluidity, which is generally a quality that<br>
conflicts with heat resistance, a high crystallinity, and<br>
low water absorbance.<br>
These characteristics of the polyamide are<br>
especially pronounced for a polyamide formed from the<br>
combination of (a) at least 50 mol% or more of 1,4-<br>
cyclohexanedicarboxylic acid and (b) at least 50 mol% or<br>
more of 2-methylpentamethylenediamine, and which has a<br>
trans isomer ratio of from 50 to 85 mol%.<br>
In the present embodiment, the trans isomer ratio<br>
can be measured by the method described in the below<br>
examples.<br>
[0056]<br>
A method for producing the polyamide according to<br>
the present embodiment is not especially limited, as long<br>
as it is a polyamide production method which comprises a<br><br><br>
step of polymerizing an (a) dicarboxylic acid comprising<br>
at least 50 mol% of an alicyclic dicarboxylic acid and a<br>
(b) diamine comprising at least 50 mol% of a diamine<br>
having a substituent branched from a main chain.<br>
It is preferred that a method for producing the<br>
polyamide further comprises a step of increasing the<br>
degree of polymerization of the polyamide.<br>
[0057]<br>
As illustrated by the following production method<br>
examples, there are various methods for producing the<br>
polyamide.<br>
1)	Heating an aqueous solution or an aqueous suspension<br>
of the dicarboxylic acid and the diamine, or an aqueous<br>
solution or an aqueous suspension of a mixture of the<br>
dicarboxylic acid, the diamine salt, and another<br>
component (hereinafter, abbreviated as "that mixture" in<br>
the following paragraphs), and polymerizing while<br>
maintaining the melt state (hereinafter, sometimes<br>
abbreviated as "hot melt polymerization").<br>
2)	Increasing the degree of polymerization while<br>
maintaining a solid state at a temperature at or below<br>
the melting point of the polyamide obtained by hot melt<br>
polymerization (hereinafter, sometimes abbreviated as<br>
"hot melt polymerization / solid phase polymerization")<br>
3)	Heating an aqueous solution or an aqueous suspension<br>
of the dicarboxylic acid and the diamine or a mixture<br>
thereof, and increasing the degree of polymerization by<br><br><br>
further re-melting the precipitated prepolymer with an<br>
extruder such as a kneader (hereinafter, sometimes<br>
abbreviated as "prepolymer / extrusion polymerization").<br>
4)	Heating an aqueous solution or an aqueous suspension<br>
of the dicarboxylic acid and the diamine or a mixture<br>
thereof, and increasing the degree of polymerization<br>
while maintaining the precipitated prepolymer in a solid<br>
state at a temperature at or below the melting point of<br>
the polyamide (hereinafter, sometimes abbreviated as<br>
"prepolymer / solid phase polymerization").<br>
5)	Polymerizing the dicarboxylic acid and the diamine,<br>
or a mixture thereof, while maintaining a solid state<br>
(hereinafter, sometimes abbreviated as "solid phase<br>
polymerization").<br>
6)	A "solution method" in which polymerization is<br>
carried out using a dicarboxylic acid halide equivalent<br>
to the dicarboxylic acid and the diamine.<br>
[0058]<br>
In the polyamide production method, it is preferred<br>
to carry out polymerization while maintaining the trans<br>
isomer ratio of the alicyclic dicarboxylic acid at from<br>
50 to 85%. From the perspective of fluidity of the<br>
polyamide, it is more preferred to carry out<br>
polymerization while maintaining at from 50 to 80%<br>
By maintaining the trans isomer ratio in the above-<br>
described range, especially at 80% or less, a high-<br><br><br>
melting-point polyamide having excellent color tone and<br>
tensile elongation can be obtained.<br>
In the polyamide production method, to increase the<br>
melting point of the polyamide by increasing the degree<br>
of polymerization, it is necessary to increase the<br>
heating temperature and/or lengthen the heating time.<br>
However, in such a case, the polyamide may color due to<br>
the heating and the tensile elongation may deteriorate<br>
due to thermal degradation. Further, a rate of increase<br>
of the molecular weight may also dramatically deteriorate.<br>
To prevent deterioration in the coloration of the<br>
polyamide and deterioration in tensile elongation due to<br>
thermal degradation, the polymerization is preferably<br>
carried out while maintaining the trans isomer ratio of<br>
the alicyclic dicarboxylic acid at 80% or less.<br>
[0059]<br>
Since it is easy to maintain the trans isomer ratio<br>
at 80% or less, and since the obtained polyamide has<br>
excellent color tone, it is preferred to produce the<br>
polyamide by 1) hot melt polymerization and 2) hot melt<br>
polymerization / solid phase polymerization.<br>
[0060]<br>
In the polyamide production method, the<br>
polymerization mode may be either a batch method or a<br>
continuous method.<br>
The polymerization apparatus is not especially<br>
limited. Examples of the polymerization apparatus<br><br><br>
include known apparatuses, such as an autoclave type<br>
reactor, a tumbler type reactor, and an extruder type<br>
reactor such as a kneader.<br>
[0061]<br>
The polyamide production method is not especially<br>
limited. For example, the polyamide can be produced by<br>
the batch hot melt polymerization method described below.<br>
Batch hot melt polymerization may be carried out by,<br>
for example, with water as a solvent, concentrating an<br>
approximately 40 to 60 mass% solution containing the<br>
polyamide components ((a) dicarboxylic acid, (b) diamine,<br>
and optionally (c) lactam and/or aminocarboxylic acid) in<br>
a concentration tank operated at a temperature of 110 to<br>
180°C and a pressure of about 0.035 to 0.6 MPa (gauge<br>
pressure) to about 65 to 90 mass% to obtain a<br>
concentrated solution. Then, this concentrated solution<br>
is transferred to an autoclave, and heating is continued<br>
until the pressure in the vessel reaches 1.5 to 5.0 MPa<br>
(gauge pressure). Subsequently, the pressure is kept at<br>
1.5 to 5.0 MPa (gauge pressure) while extracting water<br>
and/or the gas component. When the temperature reaches<br>
about 250 to 350°C, the pressure is reduced to<br>
atmospheric pressure (gauge pressure of 0 MPa) . After<br>
reducing the pressure to atmospheric pressure, the water<br>
produced as a byproduct can be effectively removed by<br>
reducing the pressure as necessary. Then, the pressure<br>
is increased with an inert gas such as nitrogen, and a<br><br><br>
polyamide melt product is extruded as a strand. This<br>
strand is cooled and cut to obtain a pellet.<br>
[0062]<br>
The polyamide production method is not especially<br>
limited. For example, the polyamide can be produced by<br>
the continuous hot melt polymerization method described<br>
below.<br>
Continuous hot melt polymerization can be carried<br>
out by, for example, with water as a solvent, pre-heating<br>
an approximately 40 to 60 mass% solution containing the<br>
polyamide components in the vessel of a preliminary<br>
apparatus to a temperature of 40 to 100°C. Then, the<br>
pre-heated solution is transferred to a concentration<br>
tank /reactor, and concentrated to about 70 to 90% at a<br>
pressure of about 0.1 to 0.5 MPa (gauge pressure) and a<br>
temperature of about 200 to 270°C to obtain a<br>
concentrated solution. This concentrated solution is<br>
discharged into a flusher having a temperature maintained<br>
at about 200 to 350°C. Subsequently, the pressure is<br>
reduced to atmospheric pressure (gauge pressure of 0 MPa).<br>
After reducing the pressure to atmospheric pressure, the<br>
pressure is reduced as necessary. Then, a polyamide melt<br>
product is extruded as a strand. This strand is cooled<br>
and cut to obtain a pellet.<br>
[0063]<br><br><br>
A molecular weight of the polyamide in the present<br>
embodiment is determined by using relative viscosity ηr<br>
at 25°C as an index.<br>
From the perspectives of mechanical properties such<br>
as toughness and rigidity, and of moldability, the<br>
polyamide according to the present embodiment preferably<br>

excellent heat resistance and chemical resistance can be<br>
obtained. By setting the polyamide glass transition<br>
temperature to be 170°C or less, a molded product having<br>
a good appearance can be obtained.<br>
Measurement of the glass transition temperature can<br>
be carried out based on JIS-K7121 as described in the<br>
below examples.<br>
Examples of the glass transition temperature<br>
measurement apparatus include the Diamond-DSC,<br>

[0068]<br>

a polyamide having excellent toughness can be obtained.<br>
[0071]<br>
The polyamide according to the present embodiment<br>
preferably has a water absorbance of 5.0% or less, more<br>
preferably 4.0% or less, and still more preferably 3.0%<br>

(B) Inorganic filler<br>
The polyamide composition according to the present<br>
embodiment is a polyamide composition comprising the<br>

As a polyamide composition, by comprising the (B)<br>
inorganic filler, a polyamide composition can be obtained<br>
having especially excellent rigidity while satisfying<br>
heat resistance, fluidity, toughness, and low water<br>
absorbance, without harming the polyamide qualities of<br>
having excellent heat resistance, fluidity, toughness,<br>
low water absorbance, rigidity and the like.<br>
Polyamides such as PA6 and PA66 cannot satisfy these<br>
requirements in terms of heat resistance, since their<br>
melting point is low.<br>
The polyamide composition also has excellent light<br>

By further comprising the (H) polymer comprising the<br>

polyamide composition comprising the (D) halogen-based<br>
flame retardant, a polyamide composition having excellent<br>

present embodiment include a polymer comprising the α, β-<br>
unsaturated dicarboxylic acid anhydride as a copolymer<br><br><br>

General formula (1)<br><br>
In general formula (1), R1 and R2 are each<br>
independently a hydrogen or an alkyl group having 1 to 3<br>
carbon atoms.<br>
[0121]<br>
Examples of the α,β-unsaturated dicarboxylic acid<br>
anhydride include maleic anhydride and methyl maleic<br>
anhydride. Maleic anhydride is preferred.<br>
Examples of the polymer comprising the α,β-<br>
unsaturated dicarboxylic acid anhydride as a copolymer<br>

In the present embodiment, when the polymer<br>
comprising the α,β-unsaturated dicarboxylic acid<br>
anhydride comprises the aromatic vinyl compound component,<br><br>
it is thought that the aromatic vinyl compound component<br>
has an affinity with the halogen-based flame retardant<br>
(brominated polystyrene etc.), and assists in the<br>
dispersion of the halogen-based flame retardant in the<br>
polyamide matrix, thereby allowing finer dispersion of<br>
the halogen-based flame retardant, due to the α,β-<br>
unsaturated dicarboxylic acid anhydride component having<br>
an affinity with or reacting with the polyamide.<br>
[0125]<br>
From perspectives such as flame resistance, fluidity,<br>
and resistance to pyrolysis, the ratio of the aromatic<br>
vinyl compound component and the α,β-unsaturated<br>
dicarboxylic acid anhydride component in the copolymer of<br>
the aromatic vinyl compound and the α,β-unsaturated<br>
dicarboxylic acid anhydride is preferably set so that the<br>

dicarboxylic acid anhydride component to 1 mass% or more,<br>
a polyamide composition having excellent mechanical<br>
properties such as toughness and rigidity as well as<br>
excellent flame resistance can be obtained. Further, by<br>
setting the ratio of the α,β-unsaturated dicarboxylic<br>
acid anhydride component to 50 mass% or less,<br><br><br>
deterioration of the polyamide composition due to the<br>
α,β-unsaturated dicarboxylic acid anhydride can be<br>

limited, as long as the method mixes the above-described<br>
(A)	polyamide and the (D) halogen-based flame retardant.<br>
Further, examples of the method for producing the<br>
polyamide composition comprising the (D) halogen-based<br>
flame retardant include a method in which the (G) flame<br>
retardant auxiliary and the (H) polymer comprising the<br>

screw or a twin-screw extruder, feeding the resultant<br>
mixture to a melt kneader, kneading, and then, optionally,<br>
adding the inorganic filler from a side feeder.<br>
[0128]<br>
The method for feeding the components constituting<br>
the polyamide can be carried out by feeding all of the<br>
constituent components all at once to the same feed<br>
opening, or by feeding from different feed openings for<br>
each constituent component.<br>
[0129]<br>
The melt kneading temperature is preferably about<br>
250 to 375°C at a resin temperature.<br>
The melt kneading time is preferably about 0.5 to 5<br>

By blending the polymer comprising the α,β-<br>
unsaturated dicarboxylic acid anhydride, the fine<br>
dispersion effects of the halogen-based flame retardant<br>
in the polyamide due to compatibilizing effect can be<br>
increased, so that a polyamide composition having an<br>

[0205]<br>
Measurement methods<br>
(1) Melting points Tml, Tm2 (°C)<br>
Melting points Tml, Tm2 were measured using the<br>
Diamond-DSC, manufactured by PERKIN-ELMER Inc., based on<br>
JIS-K7121. Measurement was carried out under conditions<br><br><br>
of a nitrogen atmosphere, by taking Tm1 (°C) as the<br>
temperature at the endothermic peak (melting peak) which<br>
appeared when the temperature of a specimen of about 10<br>
mg was increased to 300 to 350°C depending on the melting<br>
point of the sample at a rate of temperature increase of<br>
20°C/min. Tm2 was taken as the temperature of the<br>
maximum peak temperature of the endothermic peaks<br>
(melting peaks) which appeared when, after maintaining<br>
the temperature in a melt state at the maximum<br>
temperature for 2 minutes, lowering the temperature to<br>
30°C at a rate of temperature decrease of 20°C/min and<br>
then after maintaining at 30°C for 2 minutes, similarly<br>
increasing the temperature at a rate of temperature<br>
increase of 20°C/min. The total peak surface area was<br>
taken as the heat of fusion AH (J/g)• In cases where<br>
there was a plurality of peaks, areas having a AH of 1<br>
J/g or more were determined to be peaks. If there are<br>
two peaks, for example, one at a melting point of 295°C,<br>
AH = 20 J/g, and another one at a melting point of 325°C,<br>
AH = 5 J/g, the melting point was taken to be 325°C.<br>
[0206]<br>
(2) Glass transition temperature Tg (°C)<br>
The glass transition temperature was measured using<br>
the Diamond-DSC, manufactured by PERKIN-ELMER Inc., based<br>
on JIS-K7121. Measurement was carried out under<br>
conditions of using liquid nitrogen to rapidly cool a<br>
molten sample obtained by melting a specimen with a hot<br><br><br>
stage (EP80, manufactured by Mettler) to solidify the<br>
sample for use as a measurement sample. Using 10 mg of<br>
this sample, the temperature was increased to a range of<br>
from 30 to 350°C at a rate of temperature increase of<br>
20°C/min, and the glass transition temperature was<br>
measured.<br>
[0207]<br>
(3)	Relative viscosity ηr at 25°C<br>
Measurement of the relative viscosity at 25°C was<br>
carried out based on JIS-K6810. More specifically, using<br>
98% sulfuric acid, a 1% concentration solution (ratio of<br>
(polyamide 1 g) / (98% sulfuric acid 100 mL)) was<br>
prepared, and the relative viscosity was measured under<br>
temperature conditions of 25°C.<br>
[0208]<br>
(4)	Melt shear viscosity r|s (Pa.s)<br>
Fluidity was evaluated in terms of the melt shear<br>
viscosity r|s at a shear rate of 1,000 sec-1 under<br>
temperature conditions of +20°C the melting point<br>
determined in the above item (1). More specifically, the<br>
measurement method was carried out using the twin<br>
capillary rheometer RH7-2 model manufactured by ROSAND<br>
(UK) . Two orifices were used, which had a die diameter<br>
of 1.0 mm, a die inlet angle of 180°, and L/D of 16 and<br>
0.25.<br>
[0209]<br>
(5)	Tensile strength (MPa) and tensile elongation (%)<br><br><br>
Tensile strength (MPa) and tensile elongation (%)<br>
were measured based on ASTM D638 using a dumbbell<br>
injection molding test piece (3 mm thick) for ASTM<br>
tensile testing. The molding test piece was molded by<br>
mounting a dumbbell test piece (3 mm thick) die (die<br>
temperature = Tg + 20°C) for ASTM tensile testing (ASTM<br>
D638) on an injection molding machine (PS40E,<br>
manufactured by Nissei Plastic Industrial Co., Ltd.), and<br>
molding at a cylinder temperature of (Tm2 + 10)°C to (Tm2<br>
+ 30)°C.<br>
[0210]<br>
(6) Water absorbance (%)<br>
The pre-testing mass (mass before water absorbance)<br>
of a dumbbell injection molding test piece (3 mm thick)<br>
for ASTM tensile testing was measured in a post-molding<br>
dry state (dry as mold). The test piece was dipped in<br>
80°C pure water for 24 hours. The test piece was then<br>
removed from the water, and moisture adhering to the<br>
surface was wiped off. The test piece was then left for<br>
30 minutes under a constant-temperature constant-humidity<br>
(23°C, 50 RH%) atmosphere, and the post-molding mass<br>
(mass after water absorbance) was measured. The increase<br>
in the mass after water absorbance as compared with the<br>
mass before water absorbance was taken as the water<br>
absorbance amount. The average ratio of the water<br>
absorbance amount with respect to the mass before water<br><br><br>
absorbance for the number of test runs n = 3 was taken as<br>
the water absorbance (%) .<br>
[0211]<br>
(7)	Copper concentration, halogen concentration, and<br>
molar ratio of halogen and copper (halogen/Cu)<br>
The copper concentration was quantified by charging<br>
sulfuric acid into a specimen, adding nitric acid to the<br>
resultant mixture while heating to dissolve the organic<br>
component, maintaining the volume of the solution<br>
constant with pure water, and quantifying the<br>
concentration by ICP emission analysis (high-frequency<br>
plasma emission analysis). A Vista-Pro manufactured by<br>
Seiko Instruments &amp; Electronics Ltd. was used for the ICP<br>
emission analysis apparatus.<br>
The halogen concentration was quantified by, using<br>
iodine as an example, combusting a specimen in a flask<br>
purged with high-purity oxygen, trapping the produced gas<br>
in an absorbing solution, and quantifying the iodine in<br>
the trapped solution using potentiometric titration with<br>
a 1/100 N silver nitrate solution.<br>
The molar ratio of halogen and copper (halogen/Cu)<br>
was calculated using the above respective quantified<br>
values from the molecular weights converted into moles.<br>
[0212]<br>
(8)	Strength half-life (days)<br>
The dumbbell injection molding test piece (3 mm<br>
thick) for ASTM tensile testing described in the above<br><br><br>
item (5) was heat treated for a predetermined period in a<br>
hot-air oven at 200°C, and the tensile strength was<br>
measured based on ASTM-D638. Then, the tensile strength<br>
after the heat treatment as compared with the tensile<br>
strength before the heat treatment was calculated as the<br>
tensile strength retention rate. The length of heat<br>
treated time at which the tensile strength retention rate<br>
was 50% was taken as the strength half-life.<br>
[0213]<br>
(9)	Breaking stress (MPa)<br>
The dumbbell injection molding test piece (3 mm<br>
thick) for ASTM tensile testing described in the above<br>
item (5) was loaded with a tension load by a sinusoidal<br>
wave of frequency 20Hz under a 120°C atmosphere using the<br>
hydraulic servo fatigue testing machine EHF-50-10-3<br>
manufactured by Saginomiya Seisakusho Co., Ltd., to<br>
determine the breaking stress (MPa) at 1,000,000 times.<br>
[0214]<br>
(10)	Color tone b value<br>
Dumbbell injection molding test pieces (ASTM<br>
dumbbell,3 mm thick) for ASTM tensile testing were<br>
obtained by injection molding a polymer pellet with an<br>
injection molding machine under injection molding<br>
conditions of a cylinder temperature of Tm2 + 30°C, a die<br>
temperature of Tg + 20°C, and a molding cycle of 60<br>
seconds. Using the Colorimeter ND-300A manufactured by<br>
Nippon Denshoku Industries Co., Ltd., the initial molded<br><br><br>
product color tone b value was determined. Measurement<br>
was carried out using 3 dumbbell injection molding test<br>
pieces, measuring each piece 3 times at a middle section<br>
of the widened portion on the opposite gate side, and<br>
taking the average value thereof.<br>
[0215]<br>
(11)	Color tone difference Ab<br>
Dumbbell injection molding test pieces (ASTM<br>
dumbbell,3 mm thick) for ASTM tensile testing were<br>
obtained by injection molding a polymer pellet with an<br>
injection molding machine under injection molding<br>
conditions of a cylinder temperature of Tm2 + 30°C, a die<br>
temperature of Tg + 20°C, and a molding cycle of 60<br>
seconds. Using the Colorimeter ND-300A manufactured by<br>
Nippon Denshoku Industries Co., Ltd., the color tone b<br>
values of the initial molded product and the molded<br>
product after 1,000 hours were determined. The<br>
difference between these values was taken as Ab.<br>
Measurement was carried out using 3 dumbbell injection<br>
molding test pieces, measuring each piece 3 times at a<br>
middle section of the widened portion on the opposite<br>
gate side, and taking the average value thereof.<br>
[0216]<br>
(12)	Color difference AE<br>
The color difference AE after 1,000 hours was<br>
evaluated for a natural color molded product based on ISO<br>
4892-2 using a dumbbell injection molding test pieces (3<br><br><br>
mm thick) for ASTM tensile testing. The Ci4000 (xenon<br>
lamp) manufactured by ATLAS was used as the testing<br>
machine. Using the Colorimeter ND-300A manufactured by<br>
Nippon Denshoku Industries Co., Ltd., the color<br>
difference (AE) between the initial molded product and<br>
the molded product after 1,000 hours was determined.<br>
Measurement was carried out using 3 dumbbell injection<br>
molding test pieces, measuring each piece 3 times at a<br>
middle section of the widened portion on the opposite<br>
gate side, and taking the average value thereof.<br>
[0217]<br>
(13)	Trans isomer ratio<br>
30 to 40 mg of polyamide was dissolved in 1.2 g of<br>
hexafluoroisopropanol deuteride, and the trans isomer<br>
ratio was measured by 1H-NMR. For 1,4-<br>
cyclohexanedicarboxylic acid, the trans isomer ratio was<br>
determined from the ratio of the peak surface area at<br>
1.98 ppm derived from trans isomers and the peak surface<br>
areas at 1.77 ppm and 1.8 6 ppm derived from cis isomers.<br>
[0218]<br>
(14)	Flame resistance<br>
Flame resistance was measured using the UL94 method<br>
(standard specified by Underwriters Laboratories Inc.,<br>
U.S.A.). Molding of the test piece (127 mm long, 12.7 mm<br>
wide, and 1/32 inch thick) was carried out by mounting a<br>
die (die temperature = Tg + 20°C) of the UL test piece on<br>
an injection molding machine (PS40E, manufactured by<br><br><br>
Nissei Plastic Industrial Co., Ltd.), and performing<br>
molding at a cylinder temperature of (Tm2 + 20)°C. The<br>
injection pressure was +2% the full filling pressure<br>
during the molding of the UL test piece.<br>
Flame graduation was based on the UL 94 standard<br>
(vertical burning test). Further, test pieces which<br>
failed V-2 were denoted as V-2 out.<br>
[0219]<br>
(15)	Flow length (cm)<br>
The flow length was determined by molding a 2 mm<br>
thick x 15 mm wide piece with a molding machine set to<br>
the below conditions, and evaluating based on the flow<br>
length thereof (filled length, cm).<br>
Molding was carried out by mounting a fluidity<br>
evaluation (2 mm thick x 15 mm wide spiral flow path) die<br>
(die temperature = Tg + 20°C) on an injection molding<br>
machine (FN3000, manufactured by Nissei Plastic<br>
Industrial Co., Ltd.), and performing molding at a<br>
cylinder temperature of Tm2 + 20°C, an injection rate at<br>
a 20% setting, and an injection pressure at a 34% setting.<br>
[0220]<br>
(16)	Full filling pressure (%)<br>
The full filling pressure (%) during the UL test<br>
piece molding described in the above item (14) was shown.<br>
The full filling pressure was determined by<br>
standardizing the injection rates (99%) and measuring the<br>
minimum pressure capable of completely filling melted<br><br><br>
resin into the filling end inside the die, and<br>
calculating the full filling pressure as a percentage of<br>
the maximum pressure that the molding machine can apply.<br>
[0221]<br>
(17) Tensile strength retention rate after dipping (%)<br>
The dumbbell injection molding test piece (3 mm<br>
thick) for ASTM tensile testing of the above item (5) was<br>
dipped for 1,000 hours in a 130°C aqueous solution of 50%<br>
ethylene glycol. After leaving at room temperature, the<br>
tensile test of the above item (5) was carried out to<br>
measure tensile strength. The tensile strength retention<br>
rate after dipping was determined as a ratio with respect<br>
to the tensile strength measured after the molding.<br>
[0222]<br>
Example 1<br>
A polyamide polymerization reaction was carried out<br>
by "hot melt polymerization".<br>
896 g (5.20 mol) of (a) CHDA and 604 g (5.20 mol) of<br>
(b) 2MPD were dissolved in 1,500 g of distilled water to<br>
produce an equimolar 50 mass% uniform aqueous solution of<br>
the raw material monomers. 15 g (0.13 mol) of 2MPD was<br>
additionally added to this uniform solution.<br>
The obtained aqueous solution was charged into an<br>
autoclave having an internal volume of 5.4 L<br>
(manufactured by Nitto Kouatsu Co., Ltd.). The autoclave<br>
was kept warm until the solution temperature (internal<br>
temperature) was 50°C, and then the contents of the<br><br><br>
autoclave were purged with nitrogen. Heating was<br>
continued from a solution temperature of about 50°C until<br>
the pressure in the autoclave tank was, in terms of gauge<br>
pressure (in the following, pressure in the tank is<br>
always expressed as gauge pressure), about 2.5 kg/cm<br>
(the solution temperature in this system was about 145°C) .<br>
While removing water from the system to maintain the<br>
pressure in the tank at about 2.5 kg/cm2, heating was<br>
continued so that the concentration of the aqueous<br>
solution was concentrated to about 75% (the solution<br>
temperature in this system was about 160°C). Removal of<br>
water was stopped, and then heating was continued until<br>
the pressure in the tank was about 30 kg/cm2 (the<br>
solution temperature in this system was about 245°C) .<br>
While removing water from the system to maintain the<br>
pressure in the tank at about 30 kg/cm2, heating was<br>
continued until 50°C below the final temperature. After<br>
the solution temperature increased to 50°C below the<br>
final temperature (here, 300°C) , while continuing heating,<br>
the pressure in the tank was lowered over about 120<br>
minutes to atmospheric pressure (gauge pressure of 0<br>
kg/cm2) .<br>
Subsequently, the heater temperature was adjusted so<br>
that the final temperature of the resin temperature<br>
(solution temperature) would be about 350°C. With the<br>
resin temperature in that state, the tank contents were<br>
kept for 30 minutes under a reduced pressure of 400 Torr<br><br><br>
by a vacuum apparatus. Then, the pressure was increased<br>
with nitrogen, and the resin was formed into a strand<br>
from a lower spinneret (nozzle). This strand was water<br>
cooled and cut, then discharged in pellet form to obtain<br>
a polyamide. Table 4 shows the measurement results of<br>
measurements carried out on the obtained polyamide based<br>
on the above-described measurement methods.<br>
[0223]<br>
Examples 2 to 21<br>
Polyamide polymerization ("hot melt polymerization")<br>
was carried out by the method described in Example 1,<br>
except that the compounds and amounts shown in Table 1 or<br>
2 were used for the (a) dicarboxylic acid, (b) diamine,<br>
and (c) lactam and/or aminocarboxylic acid, and that the<br>
resin final temperature was the temperature shown in<br>
Table 4 or 5. Tables 4 and 5 show the measurement<br>
results of measurements carried out on the obtained<br>
polyamides based on the above-described measurement<br>
methods.<br>
[0224]<br>
Comparative Example 1<br>
Polyamide polymerization ("hot melt polymerization")<br>
was carried out by the method described in Example 1,<br>
except that the compounds and amounts shown in Table 3<br>
were used for the (a) dicarboxylic acid, (b) diamine, and<br>
(c) lactam and/or aminocarboxylic acid, and that the<br><br><br>
resin final temperature was the temperature shown in<br>
Table 6.<br>
In Comparative Example 1, during the polymerization,<br>
since the resin solidified in the autoclave, a strand<br>
could not be extracted. Therefore, after cooling, the<br>
solidified product was extracted as a lump. This lump<br>
was ground with a grinder to form roughly pellet-sized<br>
objects. Since foaming was severe during molding, a<br>
molded product could not be obtained.<br>
[0225]<br>
Comparative Examples 2 to 7<br>
Polyamide polymerization ("hot melt polymerization")<br>
was carried out by the method described in Example 1,<br>
except that the compounds and amounts shown in Table 3<br>
were used for the (a) dicarboxylic acid, (b) diamine, and<br>
(c) lactam and/or aminocarboxylic acid, and that the<br>
resin final temperature was the temperature shown in<br>
Table 6. Table 6 shows the measurement results of<br>
measurements carried out on the obtained polyamides based<br>
on the above-described measurement methods.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
[0232]<br>
As is clear from the results of Tables 4 to 6, the<br>
polyamides of Examples 1 to 21, in which a specific (a)<br>
and (b) were polymerized, had especially excellent<br>
properties for all of heat resistance, fluidity,<br>
toughness, low water absorbance, and rigidity.<br>
In contrast, in Comparative Example 1, which is a<br>
polyamide comprising less than 50 mol% of 2-<br>
methylpentamethylenediamine, the resin solidified during<br>
the copolymerization. Consequently, not only could the<br>
polyamide not be extracted as a strand, but a molded<br>
product could not be obtained.<br>
Further, for the polyamide of Comparative Example 4,<br>
which was produced by the method disclosed in Patent<br>
Document 1, fluidity was too low, and the molding<br>
properties were insufficient. In addition, toughness was<br>
also insufficient.<br>
[0233]<br>
Example 22<br>
A polyamide polymerization reaction was carried out<br>
by "hot melt polymerization / solid phase polymerization".<br>
The hot melt polymerization was carried out using<br>
the same charged amounts and the same procedures as in<br>
Example 1 to obtain a polyamide (polyamide (I)). Table 7<br>
shows the measurement results of measurements carried out<br>
on the obtained polyamide based on the above-described<br>
measurement methods. 1,300 g of the obtained polyamide<br><br><br>
was charged into a ribbon stirring type heating apparatus<br>
for solid phase polymerization (Ribocone, manufactured by<br>
Okawara Corporation), and the heating apparatus was<br>
purged with nitrogen at room temperature. While still<br>
flowing nitrogen, heating was carried out for 12 hours so<br>
that the resin temperature was 200°C. Subsequently,<br>
while still flowing nitrogen, the temperature was lowered.<br>
At about 50°C, the resin was extracted from the apparatus<br>
still as a pellet to obtain a polyamide (polyamide (II)).<br>
Table 7 shows the measurement results of measurements<br>
carried out on the obtained polyamide based on the above-<br>
described measurement methods.<br>
Compared with polyamide (I), polyamide (II), which<br>
had been subjected to solid phase polymerization, had an<br>
increased relative viscosity at 25°C and an increased<br>
tensile elongation. There was no change in the trans<br>
isomer ratio before and after the solid phase<br>
polymerization. Further, the degree of coloration also<br>
did not change.<br>
[0234]<br>
Table 7 also shows the measurement results of<br>
measurements carried out on the polyamide of Example 1<br>
obtained by hot melt polymerization based on the above-<br>
described measurement methods.<br><br><br>
[0235]<br>
Example 23<br>
A polyamide polymerization reaction was carried out<br>
by "prepolymer / solid phase polymerization".<br>
500 g of distilled water was charged into 896 g<br>
(5.20 mol) of (a) CHDA and 604 g (5.20 mol) of (b) 2MPD<br>
to produce an equimolar 33 mass% slurry of the raw<br>
material monomers. 15 g (0.13 mol) of 2MPD was<br>
additionally added to this slurry.<br>
The obtained slurry was charged into an autoclave<br>
having an internal volume of 5.4 L (manufactured by Nitto<br>
Kouatsu Co., Ltd.). The contents of the autoclave were<br>
purged with nitrogen. After stirring for 30 minutes at<br>
the solution temperature of 100°C, the temperature was<br>
increased over 2 hours to 200°C. At this stage, the<br>
pressure in the autoclave tank was 22 kg/cm2. The<br>
temperature was increased to 220°C. The slurry was kept<br>
for 2 hours while removing water from the system to<br>
maintain the pressure in the tank at 22 kg/cm2. The<br>
pressure in the tank was then lowered over 60 minutes to<br>
atmospheric pressure (gauge pressure of 0 kg/cm2) .<br>
Subsequently, the resin temperature (solution<br>
temperature) was lowered to room temperature, and a<br>
flange at a lower portion of the autoclave was removed,<br>
whereby a solid-state polyamide prepolymer was obtained<br>
(polyamide (I)). Table 7 shows the measurement results<br>
of measurements carried out on the obtained prepolymer<br><br><br>
based on the above-described measurement methods. The<br>
trans isomer ratio of 1,4-cyclohexanedicarboxylic acid of<br>
the prepolymer was 85%. Further, coloration was seen for<br>
the polyamide (I).<br>
Solid phase polymerization was carried out in the<br>
same manner as in Example 22 using 1,300 g of the<br>
obtained prepolymer to obtain a polyamide (polyamide<br>
(II)) . Table 7 shows the measurement results of<br>
measurements carried out on the obtained polyamide based<br>
on the above-described measurement methods. Compared<br>
with the prepolymer, although the polyamide (II) had an<br>
increased relative viscosity, coloration was observed.<br>
[0236]<br>
Example 2 4<br>
A polyamide polymerization reaction was carried out<br>
by "prepolymer / extrusion polymerization".<br>
The prepolymer was produced using the same charged<br>
amounts and the same procedures as in Example 23 to<br>
obtain a polyamide prepolymer (polyamide (I)). Using<br>
1,300 g of the obtained prepolymer, post-polymerization<br>
was carried out using an extrusion polymerization<br>
apparatus (KRC Kneader, manufactured by Kurimoto, Ltd.)<br>
The prepolymer was introduced with a jacket temperature<br>
of 350°C and a degree of vacuum of -0.5 MPa (gauge<br>
pressure) so that the dwell time would be 30 minutes.<br>
The strand was cooled and cut to obtain a polyamide as a<br>
pellet (polyamide (II)). Table 7 shows the measurement<br><br><br>
results of measurements carried out on the obtained<br>
polyamide based on the above-described measurement<br>
methods. Compared with the prepolymer, although the<br>
polyamide (II) had an increased relative viscosity at<br>
25°C, coloration was observed.<br><br><br><br><br>

this dried polyamide was fed from a top feed opening<br>
provided at the uppermost upstream portion of the<br>

29 in the same manner as Example 96, except the polyamide<br>
of Comparative Example 1 was used instead of the<br>

From the results of Tables 18 to 20, the polyamide<br>
compositions of Examples 96 to 118, which comprise a<br>
polyamide obtained by polymerization of a specific (a)<br>
and (b) and a phosphinate, had especially excellent<br>
properties for all of heat resistance, fluidity,<br>
toughness, low water absorbance, and rigidity, as well as<br>
excellent flame resistance.<br>

comprises a polyamide obtained by polymerization of less<br>
than 50 mol% of 2-methylpentamethylenediamine, the<br>
extrusion state was unstable, and a polyamide composition<br>
could not be obtained.<br>
Further, for the polyamide compositions of<br>

produced by the method disclosed in Patent Document 1,<br>
the full filling pressure was large, fluidity was too low,<br>
and the molding properties were insufficient. In<br>

In addition, for Comparative Example 39, which<br>
comprises a polyamide produced by the method disclosed in<br>
Patent Document 1, the melt shear viscosity was large,<br>
fluidity was too low, and the molding properties were<br>
insufficient. In addition, tensile elongation was small<br>
