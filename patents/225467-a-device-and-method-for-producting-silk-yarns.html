250, second selection unit axis 75 is placed above this surface, and near thread catching<br>
station 90.<br>
Cocoons that are provided by boiling unit 60 fail by gravity to a location near an<br>
emerging point EP in whkh selecting unit bars 71 emerge from under the water within water<br>
bath 250. These cocoons are conveyed by selecting unit bars 71 from emerging point EP<br>
along a sloped linear path to pass over second selection unit axis 75 and to be fed to thread<br>
catching unit 90. Cocoon selection unit 70 also receives and accordingly selects cocoons from<br>
circular duct 256.<br>
The cocoons are healed while they pass through boiling unit 60, thus softening the<br>
sericin within the cocoons. The healed sericin can cause cocoons to stick to each other. In<br>
order to separate the cocoons from each other and in order to strengthen the cocoons before<br>
passing through thread catching station 90, there is a need to cool the cocoons. While<br>
cocoons are being conveyed by selecting unit bars they are washed by relatively cold water<br>
(about 10-25 degrees centigrade) from cocoon sprayer 77. Cocoon sprayer 77 is located<br>
above second selection unit axis 75 and faces selection unit bars 71.<br>

station 109. Catching device 91 is comprising a plurality of brushes (collectively denoted<br>
901) that pa form reciprocal motion around their axis and also a progressive displacement<br>
along annular channel 99.<br>
Brushes 901 are configured to contact an upper portion of the cocoons that are within<br>
annular channel 99, to find a cocoon thread end and to catch it without damaging the cocoon.<br>
The return rotary motion of brashes 901 cause cocoons that contact the brushes to stay within<br>
annular channel 99 for a relative long period, thus increasing the probability that a thread end<br>
is found and caught The return rotary movement drives a cocoon to move from a brush to a<br>
consecutive brush and vice verse. Usually, the cocoon is sunken in water, its upper end is<br>
located near the surface of the water and brushes 901 enter the water and make contact with<br>
the upper end of the cocoon.<br>
Annular channel 99 is closed by cover 991 along its length, cover 991 is provided<br>
win a split in which the catching device arms are able to move. Brushes are fastened on the<br>
edges of the split and reduce losses of heat in the surroundings and reduce the energy<br>
consumption for the water heating.<br>

WSM_SPEEDJ and WSM_SPEED_1 signals from a plurality (Nl) of winding station<br>
motors and a plurality (Nl) of winding station motor monitors, and various signal mat control<br>
the speed of the various motors of the device.<br>
Control unit 280 receives data regarding the radial velocity of the plurality of winding<br>
stations and accordingly regulates the feeding of cocoons from soaking unit 260, the duration<br>
of cocoons within boiling unit 60 and temperature of the healed water within boiling unit 60,<br>
the retum-rotary movement and progressive displacement of brushes 901 of thread catching<br>
station 90, the rotation of wadding collector 100 and linear conveyor belt 120, the rotation of<br>
thread guiding shaft 120, the rotation of jagged carousel 130 and carousel catchers 150.<br>
Control unit 280 activates the rods, when mere is a need to add a cocoon thread to a<br>
silk yam, and according to the thickness of the yam accelerates or decelerates the winding<br>
process.<br>
For example, when control unit 280 receives a TH1CKI signal from defect detector<br>
arm location detector 174 is stops the winding of yam at winding station 200 by sending to<br><br>
winding station motor 207 control signal WSM_SPEED_l indicating that winding station<br>
motor has to stop.<br>
When the yam becomes too thin (for example, when one or move threads break or<br>
expires) thickness monitor arm location detector 185 sends a THIN_1 signal to control unit<br>
280. The THIN_I signals are sent until recovery of the thickness of the yarn. When control<br>
unit receives THIN_1 signal it sends a WSM_SPEED_1 signal to winding station motor 207<br>
in order to reduce the velocity of the yam winding, with the aim to reduce the length of the<br>
section where the yam becomes thin in large measure. Control unit 280 also sends PUSH1<br>
signals to rod 160 in order to catch new threads to be integrated in the yam. If threads are not<br>
caught within a predetermined period of time, control unit 208 sends WSMSPEED1<br>
signals in order to further reduce the velocity of the yam winding. In a case of sharp<br>
thickening of the yam control unit 280 stops winding station motor 207 completely. After<br>
recovery of the required thickness of yam THIN_1 signals are not generated and die velocity<br>
of the yarn winding is restored to an optimal level.<br>

unit outlet 261, via cocoon chamber 616 and boiling unit cocoon inlet 610 to cocoon boiling<br>
unit holders formed on boiling unit conveyor belt 631. These cocoons are conveyed along an<br>
elliptical path through the heated water within boiling unit 80 to cocoon outlet 611, to be<br>
provided to cocoon selection unit 70. During thier passage through boiling unit 80 the<br>
cocoons are heated and filled with water so that a portion of the sericin of the cocoons leaves<br>
the cocoons.<br>
Cocoons exit boiling unit 60 and fall by gravity to a location near an emerging point<br>
EP in which selecting unit bars 71 emerge from under the water within water bath 250. The<br>
cocoons are conveyed by selecting unit bars 71 from emerging point EP along a sloped linear<br>
path to pass over second selection unit axis 75 and to be fed to thread catching unit 90. While<br>
the cocoons are being conveyed they are washed by relatively cold water from cocoon<br>
sprayer 77. Cocoons that are thinner than CSU1 fall between parallel bars of selection unit 70<br>
to be provided to waist unit 80.<br>
Cocoons that are fed to thread catching unit 90 ate usually sunken in water, their<br>
upper end are located near the surface of the water. Brushes 901 contact an upper portion of<br>
the cocoons, force them to move within annular channel 99 and to stick to a brush mat<br>
contacts a cocoon. Brushes 901 are configured not to damage the cocoons while they contact<br>
the cocoons.<br>
Sericin that still remains in the cocoon helps cocoon threads to stick to the brashes of<br>
the thread finding station 90. The return rotary motion of the brushes causes cocoons that<br>
contact the brushes to stay within annular channel 99 for a relative long period, this<br>
movement drives cocoons from one brush to another and increases the probability that a<br>
thread end is found and caught.<br>
Cocoons that exit thread finding station 90 without having their thread being caught<br>
by one of the brushes are forced to move through conveyance section 258 and circular duct<br>
256 and to arrive to cocoon selection unit 70.<br>
Cocoons that have their threads caught by a brush of thread catching station 90 remain<br>
in the water within conveyance section 258, while their thread end is provided to wadding<br>
station 100, by a catching device arm that is lifted and lowered by curved track 94 in a<br>
manner such mat the a reliable catch of a cocoon end is achieved by wadding collector 100.<br>
Sericin that still remains in the cocoons help wadding collector 100 to perform a reliable<br>
catch of the cocoon thread end. Cocoon oscillating bar prevent cocoons having their thread<br>
winded around wadding collector 100 from sticking to cocoon oscillating bar 110 and from<br>
being drawn to wadding collector 100.<br>
Cocoons threads and accordingly cocoons are conveyed along linear conveyor station<br>
109, while dirt is removed and tangled threads are untangled or removed, so mat when<br>
cocoons reach the end of linear conveyor station 109 a single continuous silk thread is<br>
provided. Before reaching mat end the thread ends are cut by thread cutting device 104.<br>
Smooth sloped bar 103 prevents a thread mat is being conveyed toward thread guiding shaft<br>
to be forced to move to an opposite direction.<br>
Thread guiding shaft 120 receives the single cocoon thread and places the thread in<br>
way of jagged carousel 130 and carousel catcher 130 so that the thread is caught by a<br>
carousel catcher arm and wrapped around a carousel catcher cylinder. Jagged carousel 130<br>
and the carousel catcher rotate clockwise, forcing the cocoon thread and accordingly the<br>
cocoon to rattle clockwise, until the thread is provided to one of the (bread processing<br>
stations petitioned around central pole 230.<br>
A thread is provided to a thread processing station by means of a rod that contacts die<br>
thread and provides ft to an intermediate thread catcher positioned in front of die<br>
pneumatically driven rod. For convenience of explanation it is assumed that die thread is<br>
provided to thread processing station 300.<br>
Conveniently, thread processing station 300 is initialized by directing at least one<br>
thread through intermediate thread catcher 140, yarn defect detector 170, ywn thickness<br>
monitor 180, yarn twisting and guiding tout 190, and winding unit 200. After die<br>
initialization each thread that is provided to intermediate thread catcher unit 140 sticks to<br>
other threads that were previously fed to intermediate thread catcher unit 140 and passes with<br>
these threads through die various elements of thread processing station 300.<br>
A thread end passes dvough intermediate catcher groove 144 and passes through yarn<br>
defect detector 170, that sends TH1CKJ signals diat indicate if a silk yarn is too thick, and if<br>
so stops the winding process.<br>
As long as die silk yam is not too thick, the threads that form the yarn pass through<br>
twisting and guiding unit 190 where they are twisted and forced to swivel back and fourth so<br>
that a portion of the water absorbed n the threads exits die threads.<br>
The silk yam passes through yam thickness monitor 180 that detects when the yam is<br>
too thin. If a yam is too thin a THIN_l signal is sent to control unit 280, that activates<br>
pneumatic driven rod 160 in order to catch new direads and to join them to the thin yarn. The<br>
winding speed of the yarn is decreased until the yam is thick enough, and the winding speed<br>
is restored to an optimum level. The winding speed can be decreased if the yam does not<br>
thicken during a predetermined period.<br>
From the yarn thickness monitor die yam u provided to a winding station 200, and<br>
passes through yam guiding slot 2022 to bobbin 205. The rotation speed of bobbin 205 is<br>
controlled by control unit 280. During the winding process yam drying unit 210 dries the silk<br>
yam being wound around bobbin 205.<br>
Thus, mere has been described herein an embodiment including at least one preferred<br>
embodiment of an improved device for producing silk yams. It will be apparent to those<br>
skilled in the art that the disclosed subject matter may be modified in numerous ways and<br>
