The invention relates a spinning frame with a drafting unit and a spinning device, in particular to a ring spinning frame with a condensing device arranged between a drafting unit and a spinning device.<br>
Such arrangements are for example described in the publications of the patent applications with the numbers 19726694.0 and/or 19944444,7. The content of the mentioned patent applications is to be considered as a part of the present disclosure. Spinning frames of the above-mentioned type are for example contained in the international patent classification D OlH-1/22.<br>
A specific problem for spinning frames exists for the removal of the fibres which, in case of a thread breakage, are still being supplied from a material supply means, preventing said fibres from entering uncontrolledly into spinning components. For this, suction devices are applied, whereat per spinning unit a suction pipe is arranged close to the fibre flow. Such a device is illustrated in the US patent specification 4825634. The intake opening of the suction pipe is underneath a roller of the drafting unit, the so-called withdrawal roller of the drafting unit, and on the right side of the thread 5, and/or behind the thread as seen from the view of the operator, who, in case of a spinning frame according to the US-patent disclosure is on the left side of the withdrawal roller, and/or of the thread and the suction pipe. The intake opening of the suction pipe should be, as is illustrated in the US patent disclosure, as close as possible to the thread, and/or to a clamping point of the thread at the withdrawal roller. The larger the diameter of the withdrawal roller, the farther away is the suction pipe, and/or its intake opening from the clamping point on the contact zone between the withdrawal roller and a blocking roller which is pressed against it.<br>
It is the object of the invention to provide a suction device which avoids the described disadvantages-<br>
The task according to the invention is solved with the subject matter described herein. The preferred ftirther embodiments are also described herein.<br><br>
According to the invention, in a spinning frame with a drafting unit, a condensing device and a spinning device for a roving each, whereby several such devices are arranged in a spinning frame next to each other, and with a condensing element within the condensing device, a suction device consists of a so-called y-pipe which leads two suction pipes with intake-openings into a collecting pipe. Suction elbows of the suction pipe embrace a thread being stretched downward from the drafting unit in such a manner, that the intake opening of a suction pipe lies underneath a blocking roller and, in viewing line of a viewer from the right side according to figure 2 a, in front of said thread. Thus the suction effect is improved in particular if the counter roller, and/or withdrawal roller of a drafting unit, have a considerable diameter, i.e. larger than 30 mm.<br>
The invention relates to a spinning frame with a drafting unit and a spinning device for one roving each, whereby several such devices are arranged next to each other in a spinning frame, and with a suction device on the output side of the drafting unit. Underneath the drafting unit a suction device is being arranged with a suction pipe, whose intake opening lies in such a way below the pair of discharge rollers of the drafting unit, in that the thread running off the drafting unit, seen from the viewing line of an operator, lies behind the intake opening and underneath the blocking roller or in front of the roller of the pair of discharge rollers.<br>
The device according to the invention is supplemented with a condensing device with a condensing element within the condensing device, whereby a stationary suction element is assigned to the condensing element for the removal of air entering the suction element through the condensing element.<br>
One suction device for two spinning places comprises one collecting pipe leading into a suction channel and two suction pipes leading into the collecting pipe, whereby in each case a suction pipe with a suction elbow embraces a thread laterally, being stretched downward from the drafting unit, as seen from the suction channel.<br><br>
A suction elbow at the erwl of a suction ^pe changes from an essentially horizontal path of the suction pipe to an essentially vertical path at the end of the suction elbow with an intake opening,<br>
A collecting pipe is arranged transverse to the longitudinal extension of the rollers of the drafting unit, where it runs downwards inclined in the direction of a suction channel, and whereby a suction pipe with an intake opening is swivelled, over an acute angle in longitudinal direction of the spinning frame, towards a collecting pipe.<br>
Two suction pipes slantedly directed towards each other lead into a collecting pipe at a meting point.<br>
The entire arrangement is also called a y-pipe.<br>
In the following the invention is described by way of the drawing, wherein show:<br>
Fig. 1	a schematic view of a spinning unit in longitudinal direction of the spinning<br>
frame, by way of an example of a ring spinning frame;<br>
Fig. 2a       a view in longitudinal direction of a spinning frame, and/or the drafting unit rollers of a spinning frame, onto parts of the drafting unit with a condensing device and the suction device, and<br>
Fig. 2b      a view from the right side onto the arrangement according to Fig. 2a, that is, from the view of an operator who stands in fnant of the two spinning units shown in Fig. 2a,<br>
The material supply 7 according figure 1 in a conventional spinning frame either consists of a can or a roving bobbin. From the can a roving 71 (drawn as broken line) is supplied to the drafting unit. In the case of a roving bobbin, roving is taken off from the circumference of the bobbin. The roving, i.e. the condensed sliver or the fibre web, is led over a diverting means into the range of a drafting unit 1. The drafting unit<br><br>
comprises several pairs of delivery rollers 11 which are preferably partially furnished with tapes. Between the first and the second pair of delivery rollers 11 a and 11 b the roving 71 is being drawn only slightly and between the second and the following pair of rollers 31, 33 it is drawn more strongly, whereby the drawing ratio can exceed the value of 100 altogether.<br>
Between a clamping nailer 33 and a condensing element 31, the drawn roving Is being clamped and in the following it is being condensed on a condensing element 31 in the condensing device 3. The condensing element is driven by a shaft 11c, with which it is connected by form closure or by friction force. It can be designed as a clrcular-cylindric or as &amp; non-circular-cylindric dnjm, In the latter case, for example, as an air-permeable continuous tape. The roving leaving the drafting unit 1 is of a width which decreases duiing the condensing process. Along the condensing zone 31'a guide 39, preferably in the form of an umbrella-shaped part, can accompany the roving at the surface of the condensing element 31.<br>
Finally a blocking roller 35 is provided in the condensing zone, said roller is being pressed against the condensing element 31 and thus blocks the twist forming action of a spinning device 5 in opposite direction of the flow of material. Inside the condensing element 31 is a suction element 37 which is connected to a suction device 4. The condensing element 31 is preferably a perforated rotary drum, while the suction element 37, within the range of the perforation, comprises a suction opening.<br>
Between the drafting unit 1 and the spinning device 5 are yarn guides 55, 55' which, in case of a ring-spinning device, limit the yam balloon of the thread 73 in upward direction according to figure 1, Within the lower range of the spinning device the thread 73, by means of a traveller 53 on a ring which is attached on a ring frame 51 and due to the rotation of a spindle 59 provided with a drive unit, is wound onto a thread package 75, The height of the thread package is determined by the motion range of a ring frame drive 57 that shifts the ring frame 51 up and down in vertical direction according to figure 1.<br><br>
The suction device according to the invention is illustrated in detail in figure 2a and 2b, that is, by way of the example of a drafting unit 1 of a spinning franw with a condensing device 3, arranged thereto according to figure 1. The suction pipe 62 is arranged below the pair of outlet rollers 31, 11c, 35 of the drafting unit 1. Contrary to the mentioned suction pipe acconjing to the state of the art as it is represented in the mentioned US patent disclosure, the intake opening and/or the suction opening 66 of the suction pipe is not arranged below the withdrawal cylinder or the withdrawal roller 31 of the drafting unit, but underneath a blocking roller 35 pressed against it. The intake opening or suction opening 66 is, as illustrated in figure 2a, on the right side of the thread running path, and/or in front of the thread 73 as seen in the view according to figure 2b. The intake opening 66 of the suction opening is preferably of oval shape; in other words the aperture width of the intake opening 66 in longitudinal direction of the rollers, for example the withdrawal roller 11 c, and/or 31 of the drafting unit 1, is larger than in the direction crosswise to it, so that a thread 73 which is on the condensing element 31 with its perforation 31, executes a traversing movement transverse to the circumferential direction U in figure 2b, always remains in alignment with a part of the suction pipe 62. The intake opening 66 of the suction pipe is essentially directed vertically upward or, in other words, against the thread running direction. It is followed by a suction elbow 62a which leads up to the essentially horizontal njnnlng suction pipe 62. In the exemplified embodiment according to the illustration in figure 2a, the suction pipe 62 runs with a slight downward inclination from the right to the left. According to figure 2b two spinning units with two withdrawal rollers 11c, and/or condensing elements 31, are arranged next to each other, each of which has a thread, and/or roving 73 being led over It Accordingly two suction pipes 62 and 62' also run next to each other, up to a merging point 64a within which the air flows from the suction pipes 62 and 62' unite according to figure 2b to a single collecting pipe 64. The air flows from a collecting pipe 64, and/or a larger number of collecting pipes 64, are, as well, just like the air flows from the suction devices 4 according to figure 1, preferably led into a common channel 65 or into a separate channel.<br>
In figure 2a, the suction device 60, drawn in full line, is in the operating position and said suction device in the position 60\ drawn in dotted lines underneath of it, is the<br><br>
maintenance position of the spinning unit. The latter position of the pipe is then necessary If an operator has to do work at the discharge of the drafting unit 1. According to figure 2b a collecting pipe 64 runs between two thread paths 73. The suction pipes 62 and 62' thus run slantedly outwanJ as well as upward from the merging point 64a, up to the intake opening 66 underneath the clamping point of the preferably circular-cyiindrically shaped condensing element 31 and the blocking roller 35. Thereby one thread 73 each is in a way embraced laterally by the suction pipe 62, and/or 62'.<br><br><br>
