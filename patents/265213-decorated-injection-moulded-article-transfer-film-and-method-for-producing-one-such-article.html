				<td>Decorated injection molded article as well as a transfer film and a process<br>
for producing same<br>
The invention concerns a decorated injection molded article which is<br>
formed from at least one injected plastic material and at least one<br>
decorative element mechanically fixedly connected thereto, wherein the<br>
decorative element has one or more layer portions and provides a<br>
decoration and/or a protective layer for the injection molded article and<br>
wherein the injection molded article has at least one injection molded seam<br>
which is formed on the injected plastic material in the injection molding<br>
operation in the closing region of an injection molding mold or in the<br>
transitional region between at least two individual parts of the injection<br>
molding mold.<br>
The invention further concerns a transfer film for the production of<br>
such a decorated injection molded article, wherein the transfer film has at<br>
least a carrier film, a release layer arranged on the carrier film and a<br>
transfer layer means arranged on the side of the release layer remote from<br>
the carrier film, as a decorative element, wherein the decorative element<br>
has one or more layer portions and provides a decoration and/or a<br>
protective layer for the injection molded article, wherein the transfer layer<br>
means adjoining the release layer has at least one protective lacquer layer<br>
and/or at least one decorative layer and adjoining the protective lacquer or<br>
decorative layer on the side of the transfer film remote from the carrier film<br>
at least one adhesive layer which softens at an injection molding<br>
temperature and bonds to a plastic injection material to form the injection<br>
molded article.<br>
The invention further concerns a process for the production of a<br>
decorated injection molded article using a transfer film has at least a carrier<br>
film, a release layer arranged on the carrier film and a transfer layer means<br>
arranged on the side of the release layer remote from the carrier film, as a<br>
decorative element, wherein the decorative element has one or more layer<br>
portions and provides a decoration and/or a protective layer for the<br>
injection molded article, wherein the transfer layer means adjoining the<br>
release layer has at least one protective k.cquer layer and/or at least one<br>
decorative layer and adjoining the protective lacquer or decorative layer on<br>
the side of the transfer film remote from the carrier film at least one<br>
priming layer, wherein the transfer film is arranged in an opened injection<br>
molding mold comprising at least two individual parts, the injection molding<br>
mold is closed and filled with plastic injection material, wherein the priming<br>
layer softens at an injection temperature and bonds to the plastic injection<br>
material and wherein formed on the injection molded article is at least one<br>
injection molded seam which is formed in the closure region of the injection<br>
molding mold or in the transitional region between the at least two<br>
individual parts of the injection molding mold, wherein the plastic injection<br>
material is hardened to provide a solid plastic material. Decoration<br>
processes of that kind for injection molded articles are usually referred to<br>
as inmold decoration processes or IMD injection molding processes.<br>
Decorated injection molded articles, processes for the production<br>
thereof and inmold-capable transfer films or IMD films are known per se.<br>
Thus DE 102 21 482 Cl discloses an apparatus for the production of a<br>
molding comprising a hardening injection molding material which is<br>
decorated by inmold injection with a stamping film comprising a carrier film<br>
and a decorative layer. In that case the stamping film is introduced into<br>
the opened injection molding tool, the decorative layer of the stamping film<br>
facing towards an upper part of the mold. The injection molding mold is<br>
closed and liquid injection molding material is injected into the injection<br>
molding mold cavity through an injection passage, in which case the<br>
stamping film is caused to adhere closely to the visible side of the injection<br>
molded part. In that situation the stamping film is joined to the injection<br>
molding material which after hardening is removed from the injection<br>
molding mold. After the carrier film is pulled off the decorative layer the<br>
decorated molding is finished. Injection molded articles which are<br>
decorated in that way are used in particular in relation to internal parts of<br>
motor vehicles such as door strips, strips in instrument panels, shift lever<br>
covers, central console covers and in relation to external parts of motor<br>
vehicles such as door ram guard strips, covers on A, B and C pillars and in<br>
the audio and video fields in relation to decorative strips on the casings of<br>
radios and televisions.<br>
DE 102 36 810 Al discloses partially structured multi-layered films<br>
which are suitable for use in injection molding molds. Such an IMD-capable<br>
multi-layer film or a multi-layer film for inmold decoration of injection<br>
molded parts comprises a carrier film with a decorative element for transfer<br>
onto the injection molded part. The carrier film is removed after the<br>
decorative element has been applied to the injection molded body. The<br>
decorative element has a release layer, a protective lacquer layer, a<br>
structure layer with a spatial structure, an intermediate layer, a reflection<br>
layer and an adhesive layer. The release layer serves in that respect for<br>
releasing the decorative element from the carrier and can comprise for<br>
example a wax-like material.<br>
As disclosed by JP 62128720 A, IMD films are usually guided<br>
between a fixed and a movable part of the injection molding mold by way<br>
of a film advance device. In the case of individual image representations in<br>
the region of the decorative film which is to be applied by lamination, the<br>
IMD film is also positioned in the correct position relative to the injection<br>
molding mold by way of sensors and position markings on the IMD film<br>
before the injection molding mold is closed and the hot plastic injection<br>
material is injected behind the IMD film.<br>
Hitherto, due to the manufacturing procedure involved, injection<br>
molded articles decorated with a decorative element in an inmold process<br>
involve complete coverage with the decorative element of a surface region<br>
which is defined by an injection molded seam extending in a ring<br>
configuration on the plastic material. Such a surface region generally<br>
predominantly also forms the visible surface of the injection molded article<br>
so that this involves decoration over the entire area thereof of the complete<br>
visible surface. Accordingly the optical appearance of the injection molded<br>
article is hitherto dependent on the decorative element used.<br>
Now, the object of the invention is to afford injection molded articles<br>
decorated with decorative elements and having a novel optical appearance,<br>
as well as an improvement in their subsequent further processability. The<br>
invention further seeks to provide a transfer film suitable for forming such<br>
decorated injection molded articles as well as a suitable process for the<br>
production of such decorated injection molded articles.<br>
For the decorated injection molded article which is formed from at<br>
least one injected plastic material and at least one decorative element<br>
mechanically fixedly connected thereto, wherein the decorative element has<br>
one or more layer portions and provides a decoration and/or a protective<br>
layer for the injection molded article and wherein the injection molded<br>
article has at least one injection molded seam which is formed on the<br>
injected plastic material in the injection molding operation in the closing<br>
region of an injection molding mold or in the transitional region between at<br>
least two individual parts of the injection molding mold, that object is<br>
attained in that the at least one decorative element only partially covers a<br>
surface region of the plastic material defined by an injection molded seam<br>
extending in an annular configuration on the plastic material and that the<br>
decorative element has at least one protective lacquer layer and/or at least<br>
one decorative layer and adjoining the protective lacquer or decorative<br>
layer at least one priming layer which softens at an injection molding<br>
temperature for the plastic material, wherein the priming layer is bonded to<br>
the plastic material.<br>
In a surface region defined by an injection molded seam extending in<br>
an annular configuration on the plastic material, the injection molded article<br>
as set forth in the invention has only partial coating with the decorative<br>
element so that, in the visible region, beside the region or regions<br>
decorated with the decorative element of the injection molded article, there<br>
are there also regions with hardened plastic injection material without<br>
being covered by a decorative element. That opens up a large number of<br>
new possible ways of providing a visually attractive, decorated injection<br>
molded article. If moreover attractive color configuration of the plastic<br>
injection material is considered, that affords further new optical effects.<br>
Thus for example it is possible to provide injection molded articles for the<br>
automobile sector, which have a marquetry decoration. In that respect the<br>
marquetry or the marquetry effect are produced by partially provided<br>
decorative elements. In addition, the exposed regions of the hardened<br>
plastic injection material provide that further processing of the injection<br>
molded article is enormously simplified, as will be further described<br>
hereinafter.<br>
It is particularly preferred if the at least one decorative element is<br>
superimposed on a three-dimensional surface structuring of the plastic<br>
material. In that case the three-dimensional structure can only be visible<br>
through the decorative element, but it can also be detected by touch in the<br>
region of the decorative element. That makes it possible to produce<br>
particularly attractive visual effects.<br>
It is further preferred if the at least one decorative element on its<br>
side remote from the first plastic material is at least partially over-injected<br>
with a second plastic material. In that respect further optical effects can be<br>
produced, for achieving an optical depth, such as for example lens effects.<br>
However, injecting plastic material over the decorative element just for<br>
protecting it from mechanical loading and/or corrosive attack has also<br>
proven its worth.<br>
Further optically attractive effects can be achieved if on its side<br>
remote from the at least one decorative element the second plastic material<br>
is at least partially covered with at least one further decorative element. In<br>
that respect the decorative elements can be optically superimposed so that<br>
for example specific depth effects or color effects are attained.<br>
For a transfer film for the production of such a decorated injection<br>
molded article, wherein the transfer film has at least a carrier film, a<br>
release layer arranged on the carrier film and a transfer layer means<br>
arranged on the side of the release layer remote from the carrier film, as a<br>
decorative element, wherein the decorative element has one or more layer<br>
portions and provides a decoration and/or a protective layer for the<br>
injection molded article, wherein the transfer layer means adjoining the<br>
release layer has at least one protective lacquer layer and/or at least one<br>
decorative layer and adjoining the protective lacquer or decorative layer on<br>
the side of the transfer film remote from the carrier film at least one<br>
priming layer which softens at an injection molding temperature and bonds<br>
to the plastic injection material to form the injection molded article, that<br>
object is attained in that<br>
a) a masking layer only partially covers the priming layer on its side<br>
remote from the carrier film, wherein the masking layer is such that it does<br>
not bond to the plastic material under injection conditions, or<br>
b) the priming layer is only arranged region-wise and the protective<br>
lacquer or decorative layer adjoining the priming layer is such that it does<br>
not bond to the plastic material under injection conditions, or<br>
c) the transfer layer is only arranged region-wise on the release layer<br>
and the release layer is such that it does not bond to the plastic material<br>
under injection conditions.<br>
The fact that the respective layers in cases a), b) and c) are not<br>
bonded to the plastic material makes it possible for injection molded<br>
articles to be partially decorated at their surface in a simple and<br>
inexpensive fashion.<br>
Suitable layers which prevent adhesion or bonding to the plastic<br>
injection material preferably have a softening temperature which is<br>
markedly above the processing temperature in the injection molding tool.<br>
It is particularly preferred in that respect if in case a) the masking layer, in<br>
case b) the protective lacquer or decorative layer adjoining the priming<br>
layer and in case c) the release layer withstands an injection temperature<br>
for the plastic material without softening. That means that bonding to the<br>
injected plastic material is made greatly more difficult.<br>
It is further advantageous if in case a) the masking layer, in case b)<br>
the protective lacquer or decorative layer adjoining the priming layer and in<br>
case c) the release layer is chemically incompatible with the plastic material<br>
so that repulsion already occurs at a molecular level, to prevent bonding to<br>
the injected plastic material.<br>
In contrast layers of the transfer film which are to be mechanically<br>
firmly bonded to the plastic material preferably soften at least partially<br>
under the processing temperatures in the injection molding mold and have<br>
at least slight compatibility with the molten plastic material.<br>
It has proven appropriate if in case a) the masking layer, in case b)<br>
the protective lacquer or decorative layer adjoining the priming layer and in<br>
case c) the release layer is a lacquer layer which is highly cross-linked by<br>
radiation hardening, isocyanate hardening or acid hardening. Lacquer<br>
layers which are highly cross-linked by radiation hardening, isocyanate<br>
hardening or acid hardening do not bond to a hot plastic injection material<br>
and therefore permit easy and defined separation from the injection molded<br>
body.<br>
For example acid-hardened melamine resin lacquer, 2-component<br>
polyurethanes or radiation-hardened lacquer have proven their worth as<br>
the masking layer.<br>
The release or separation action of such a layer can be further<br>
enhanced if for example lacquers are used, which have a very uniform layer<br>
thickness in the region of 0.1 - 20 urn, preferably 0.3 - 2.5 urn, and have a<br>
smooth surface with a surface roughness in order as far as possible to<br>
prevent mechanical interlocking with the plastic injection material. It is<br>
also advantageous if those lacquer layers have a low surface tension. The<br>
surface tension of the masking layer can be further reduced by suitable<br>
additives, preferably wax-based, fluorohydrocarbon-based or silicone-based<br>
additives so that the separation action thereof is further enhanced.<br>
Suitable substances here are in particular hydroxyfunctional polyethermodified<br>
polysiloxanes, dispersions of polyethylene waxes with a melting<br>
range below 130°C and functionalized fluoroethylene mixed polymers<br>
(hydroxy number: 55 mg KOH/g).<br>
In order to avoid as completely as possible contamination of the<br>
plastic injection material by the masking layer, it has proven advantageous<br>
if the additive is anchored by chemical reactions in the polymer network of<br>
the masking layer.<br>
For the process for the production of a decorated injection molded<br>
article using a transfer film which has at least a carrier film, a release layer<br>
arranged on the carrier film and a transfer layer means arranged on the<br>
side of the release layer remote from the carrier film, as a decorative<br>
element, wherein the decorative element has one or more layer portions<br>
and provides a decoration and/or a protective layer for the injection molded<br>
article, wherein the transfer layer means adjoining the release layer has at<br>
least one protective lacquer layer and/or at least one decorative layer and<br>
adjoining the protective lacquer or decorative layer on the side of the<br>
transfer film remote from the carrier film at least one priming layer,<br>
wherein the transfer film is arranged in an opened injection molding mold<br>
comprising at least two individual parts, the injection molding mold is<br>
closed and filled with plastic injection material wherein the priming layer<br>
softens at an injection temperature and bonds to the plastic injection<br>
material and wherein formed on the injection molded article is at least one<br>
injection molded seam which is formed in the closure region of the injection<br>
molding mold or in the transitional region between the at least two<br>
individual parts of the injection molding mold, and wherein the plastic<br>
injection material is hardened to provide a first plastic material, that object<br>
is attained in that the at least one decorative element is transferred onto a<br>
surface region of the plastic material defined by an injection molded seam<br>
extending in an annular configuration on the plastic material, in such a way<br>
that the at least one decorative element only partially covers the surface<br>
region. Such a process permits the production of injection moldings<br>
according to the invention, which are only region-wise decorated and thus<br>
give rise to particular visual impressions on the part of viewers. Thus for<br>
example the viewer can be induced to think that there is marquetry here.<br>
It has proven to be advantageous for the process according to the<br>
invention if a transfer film according to the invention is used, which is<br>
arranged in the injection molding mold in such a way that the carrier film<br>
bears directly against the injection molding mold. When the plastic<br>
injection material is injected into the injection molding mold the transfer<br>
film is pressed against the inside wall of the injection molding mold.<br>
The layers disposed on the carrier film which is preferably of a<br>
thickness in the region of between 19 and 100 um are preferably produced<br>
by intaglio printing, screen printing or, in particular the decorative layers,<br>
also by digital, flexo or offset printing.<br>
8<br>
If a transfer film in accordance with case a) is used the hot plastic<br>
injection material comes into contact with the masking layer and exposed<br>
regions of the priming layer. The plastic injection material is mechanically<br>
firmly bonded in the direct contact region to the priming layer, in which<br>
case the priming layer at least starts to melt or melts completely. No<br>
bonding occurs in the direct contact region between the masking layer and<br>
the plastic injection material as the masking layer does not bond to the<br>
plastic material, preferably, insofar as it does not soften or it softens only<br>
above the injection temperature, and there is no chemical reaction with the<br>
plastic injection material in the region of the injection temperature. After<br>
cooling of the plastic injection material the injection molding mold is<br>
opened and the carrier film is removed. In that situation, only the regions<br>
of the decorative element which are mechanically fixedly joined to the<br>
plastic material by way of the priming layer remain on the hardened plastic<br>
injection material. The regions of the decorative element which were<br>
covered by means of the masking layer are removed together with the<br>
carrier film and the masking layer so that the result is a decorated injection<br>
molded article in accordance with the invention. The use of a transfer film<br>
in accordance with case a) is particularly inexpensive as it is possible to use<br>
a conventional, IMD-capable transfer film which is only provided with a<br>
masking layer in the desired pattern or decoration. That means that a<br>
change in pattern can also be implemented easily, inexpensively and<br>
quickly.<br>
It has proven advantageous if the masking layer is of a thickness in<br>
the region of between 1 and 4 urn. With such a layer thickness, particularly<br>
sharp edges and good transfer results are achieved for the decorative<br>
elements which are transferred in region-wise manner.<br>
In order to guarantee reliable transfer of the transfer layer of the<br>
transfer film in case a), it is preferred if the masking layer has at least one<br>
opening of a diameter of at least 0.15 mm. Smaller diameters lead to<br>
incomplete transfer of transfer layer regions, with untidy, randomly varying<br>
edges, as the hot plastic injection material cannot penetrate through the<br>
opening or can only limitedly penetrate through the opening and bond to<br>
the priming layer.<br>
If a transfer film in accordance with case b) is used, the hot plastic<br>
injection material comes into contact with the partially arranged priming<br>
layer and with the regions of a protective lacquer or decorative layer, which<br>
are uncovered by the priming layer. The hot plastic injection material<br>
mechanically fixedly bonds in the direct contact region to the priming layer,<br>
in which case the priming layer at least starts to melt or melts completely.<br>
No bonding occurs in the direct contact region between the protective<br>
lacquer or decorative layer and the plastic injection material as the<br>
protective lacquer or decorative layer does not bond to the plastic material,<br>
preferably insofar as it does not soften or it softens only above the injection<br>
temperature and there is also no chemical reaction with the plastic injection<br>
material in the region of the injection temperature. In that respect, the<br>
materials which can be used for the protective lacquer or decorative layer<br>
adjoining the priming layer can be those which are also suitable for the<br>
masking layer of case a), for example UV lacquer on a polyacrylate base or<br>
2-component polyurethane lacquer. After cooling of the plastic injection<br>
material the injection molding mold is opened and the carrier film is<br>
removed. In that case only the regions of the decorative element which<br>
are mechanically fixedly joined to the plastic material by way of the priming<br>
layer remain on the hardened plastic injection material. The regions of the<br>
protective lacquer or decorative layer or layers which were uncovered by<br>
the priming layer are removed together with the carrier film so that the<br>
result is a decorated injection molded article in accordance with the<br>
invention. The use of a transfer film in accordance with case b) is also<br>
inexpensive as it is possible to use a conventional IMD-capable transfer film<br>
which is only provided with a priming layer in the desired pattern or<br>
decoration. That means that in this case also a change in pattern can be<br>
effected easily, inexpensively and quickly.<br>
If a carrier film in accordance with case c) is used the hot plastic<br>
injection material comes into contact with the priming layer of the partially<br>
provided transfer layer as well as the exposed regions of a release layer<br>
which can also be produced over a surface of a carrier film of suitable<br>
material. The hot plastic injection material is mechanically fixedly bonded<br>
in the direct contact region to the priming layer, in which case the priming<br>
layer at least starts to melt or melts completely. No bonding occurs in the<br>
direct contact region between the release layer and the plastic injection<br>
material, preferably insofar as the release layer does not soften or softens<br>
only above the injection temperature and there is also no chemical reaction<br>
with the plastic injection material in the region of the injection temperature.<br>
In that respect the materials which can be used for the release layer can be<br>
those which are also suitable for the masking layer in accordance with case<br>
a), for example acid-hardened melamine resin lacquer, 2-component<br>
polyurethanes or radiation-hardened lacquer. After cooling of the plastic<br>
injection material the injection molding mold is opened and the carrier film<br>
is removed. In that case the decorative elements which are respectively<br>
mechanically fixedly joined to the plastic material by way of the priming<br>
layer remain on the hardened plastic injection material. The release layer<br>
is removed together with the carrier film so that the result obtained is a<br>
decorated injection molded article in accordance with the invention. The<br>
use of a transfer film in accordance with case c) is somewhat more<br>
expensive as the protective lacquer and decorative layers as well as the<br>
priming layer must be formed one above the other in register relationship.<br>
That means that a change in pattern here is somewhat more timeconsuming<br>
than when using the transfer films of case a) or b).<br>
Preferably in case a) the masking layer, in case b) the priming layer<br>
and in case c) the transfer layer are of a patterned configuration so that the<br>
result is patterned decoration of the injection molded article. In that<br>
respect the masking layer represents the negative for the pattern while in<br>
case b) the priming layer and in case c) the transfer layer represent the<br>
positive for the pattern. In that respect the term pattern is used to denote<br>
regular or irregular patterns, alphanumeric character representations or<br>
image representations such as coats of arms, logos, nature motifs or the<br>
like.<br>
For the transfer film according to the invention, it has proven<br>
advantageous if the decorative layer includes an at least partially provided<br>
metal layer and/or an at least partially provided interference layer and/or<br>
an at least partially provided color layer and/or an at least partially<br>
arranged layer with relief structures such as macroscopic relief structures,<br>
diffractive structures or holograms, and/or a pigmented layer which has<br>
fluorescent or phosphorescent pigments or pigments with viewing angledependent<br>
color change effects.<br>
For the protective lacquer layer of the transfer film according to the<br>
invention it has proven advantageous if the protective lacquer layer is<br>
colorlessly transparent, colored transparent or at least region-wise opaque.<br>
Further optical effects can be achieved in that way.<br>
If the carrier film is formed from a material which can be readily<br>
released from the transfer layer after the injection molding operation, the<br>
transfer film has a surface which itself forms the release layer. The carrier<br>
film and the release layer thus form a unit. In that case it is possible to<br>
dispense with an additional release layer on the carrier film.<br>
As already mentioned hereinbefore, further processing of the<br>
injection molded article is enormously simplified by virtue of the exposed<br>
regions of the hardened plastic injection material. Thus exposed regions of<br>
the hardened plastic injection material can be lacquered in a simple fashion<br>
without having to take account of the decorative film. In that respect the<br>
lacquer used only has to be matched to the material of the plastic injection<br>
material employed. More specifically, when the visible surface of the<br>
injection molded article was covered with the decorative film over the<br>
entire surface area, it was hitherto necessary for the lacquer for lacquering<br>
given regions of the injection molded article to be matched to the<br>
respective uppermost layer of the decorative film used. In the worst-case<br>
scenario that meant that a plurality of lacquer layers had to be produced on<br>
the uppermost layer of the decorative film in order to achieve the desired<br>
lacquering result.<br>
Furthermore, it is now possible in a simple and uncomplicated<br>
fashion for a region of the injection molded article according to the<br>
invention, in which the hardened plastic injection material is not covered by<br>
the decorative film, to be glued, pressed or welded to further structural<br>
units, for example by means of laser radiation or ultrasound. In that<br>
respect, it is only necessary to heed matching of the process parameters of<br>
the joining process adopted, to the hardened plastic injection material of<br>
the injection molded article and the counterpart components which are to<br>
be joined thereto, without however heeding the decorative film used which<br>
frequently can only be exposed to lower temperatures or lower mechanical<br>
stresses than the hardened plastic injection material.<br>
The injection molded article according to the invention is also found<br>
to be advantageous if a second plastic injection material is to be injected<br>
thereover in a further injection molding mold in order for example to<br>
produce lens-like elements. In that case it is usually possible to afford a<br>
good durable join between the hardened plastic material and the second<br>
plastic injection material. In principle the same or different plastic<br>
materials can be employed for the hardened plastic material and for the<br>
second plastic injection material, in which respect the reference to the<br>
same materials also denotes those which only involve different coloration of<br>
the plastic which is otherwise the same. In that respect the structure of<br>
the decorative film is advantageously not of significance.<br>
Such an exposed region of the hardened plastic injection material<br>
can also be labeled or written upon without complication in the visible<br>
region of the injection molded article, for example by means of a laser.<br>
There is also the possibility that any optical lens systems arranged on the<br>
injection molded article or contact surfaces of electrically conducting<br>
contact structures incorporated into the plastic injection molded body<br>
remain uncovered by the decorative film so that they remain directly visible<br>
and accessible or in the case of contact surfaces so that they can be<br>
connected to electrical cables or electrical components. Therefore, it is no<br>
longer necessary to take any account of the decorative film so that in<br>
general terms this permits the injection molded article according to the<br>
invention to be further processed in a highly uncomplicated, fast and<br>
therefore inexpensive manner.<br>
