HONDA GIKEN KOGYO KABUSHIKI KAISHA, a corporation of Japan, having a place of business at 1-1, Minamiaoyama 2-chome, Minato-ku, Tokyo, Japan<br>
The   following   specification   particularly   describes   the   nature   of  the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed :-<br>
988/MUM/2000<br>
6 NOV 2000              GRANTED<br><br>
[Detailed Description of the Invention] [0001]<br>
[Technical Field to Which the Invention Pertains]<br>
The present invention relates to an oil recovery system for a two-cycle engine, in which an oil recovery<br><br><br>
chamber communicated to a bottom of a crank chamber of a two-cycle engine or a two-cycle engine for a motorcycle is connected to an intake system of the two-cycle engine via a return pipe line. [0002]<br>
[Prior Art]<br>
It has been known, for example, from Japanese<br>
Patent Laid-open No. Hei 5-179920 that in a two-cycle<br>
engine, since oil supplied together with air-fuel mixture<br>
and oil supplied to a lubrication portion via an oil<br>
passage are accumulated on a bottom of a crank chamber,<br>
the oil accumulated on the bottom of a crank chamber is<br>
recovered by making use of depression at an engine<br>
manifold and is returned to an intake system.<br>
[0003].	<br>
[Problem to be Solved by the Invention]<br>
However, in a cold state of a two-cycle engine directly after start-up of the engine, since the engine temperature is low and the heat generation is small, the oil returned to an intake system cannot be perfectly burned, and the unburned oil may be discharged as white smoke together with exhaust gas.  To prevent the occurrence of such white smoke, the oil recovery system disclosed in the above-described document is configured<br><br>
such that a return pipe line is connected to a portion, on the upstream side from a throttle valve, of an intake system.  In such a system, since the depression at an engine manifold is low directly after start-up of the engine, the return of oil to the intake system can be prevented by provision of a check valve, to thereby prevent the occurrence of white smoke; however, if a snapping operation is performed directly after start-up of the two-cycle engine, oil is returned to the intake system, to cause white smoke. [0004]<br>
In view of the foregoing, the present invention has been made&gt; and- a first object of the present invention is to provide an oil recovery system for a two-cycle engine, which is capable of certainly preventing the occurrence -of white smoke even by a snapping operation directly after start-up of the engine. [0005]<br>
Further, in the above-described prior art two-cycle engine, a pressure loss may occur in the crank chamber due to the depression at an engine manifold when the oil is returned to the intake system side, which leads to degradation of the engine performance. Also oil may counter-flow from an oil recovery chamber to the crank<br><br>
chamber   side   due   to   pressure   pulsation   of   the   crank chamber,    vibration   from  a   road   surface   upon   running   of   a motorcycle,   and   vibration   of   the   engine,    which   leads   to degradation  of   the   engine   recovery  performance. [0006]<br>
In   view   of   the   foregoing,    the  present   invention  has been  made,   and   a   second   object   of   the  present   invention is   to  provide   an   oil   recovery   system   for   a   two-cycle engine   of   a  motorcycle,   which   is   capable   of   improving   the oil   recovery performance   while   avoiding   the   degradation of   the   engine  performance   due   to   a   pressure   loss   in   a crank  chamber. [0007]<br>
[Means for Solving the Problem]<br>
To achieve the above first object, according an invention described, there is provided an oil recovery system for a two-cycle engine, in which an oil recovery chamber communicated to a bottom of a crank chamber of a two-cycle engine (E) is connected to an intake system of said two-cycle engine (E) via a return pipe line, characterized in that<br>
said oil recovery system has a control valve for prohibiting return of oil from said oil recovery chamber to said intake system until the engine state     reaches     a     specific     warming     state     after     start-up     of<br><br><br>
the two-cycle engine.<br>
With this configuration of the invention as described since the return of oil from the oil recovery chamber to the intake system is prohibited by the control valve until the engine state reaches the specific warming state directly after start-up of the two-cycle engine, oil is not returned to the intake system even by a snapping operation before the engine state reaches the warming state, with a result that it is possible to certainly prevent the occurrence of white smoke.<br>
According to the invention described, the control valve is an electromagnetic switching valve operated to alternatively switch the communication state of a first port connected to the oil recovery chamber, a second port connected to the intake system, and a third port, between a state in which the first port is communicated to the second port and a state in which the first port is communicated to the third port; and an open pipe line with its one end connected to the third port is raised upwardly from the control valve, and the other end of the open pipe line is opened to atmospheric air. With this configuration, in the state in which the return of oil to the intake system is prohibited by cutting off the communication between the first and second ports and allowing the communication between the first and third ports and, the oil recover chamber does not become an enclosed state, with a result that the recovery of oil from the crank chamber to the oil recovery chamber can be desirably performed. Further, since the open pipe line communicated to the third port is raised upwardly from the control valve, it is possible to prevent oil from flowing on the open pipe line side.<br><br>
According to an invention, the oil recovery chamber ts connected to a portion, positioned between a throttle valve and a reed valve, of the intake system via the return pipe line. With this configuration, it is possible to prevent oil returned to the intake system from adhering on the throttle valve and hence to improve the workability of the throttle valve, and to promote atomization of return oil supplied to the crank chamber side by action of the reed valve and hence to improve the combustibility of oil and more effectively prevent the occurrence of white smoke.<br>
According to an invention , the specific warming state is set at a state in which catalyst in a catalyst device provided in an exhaust system of the two-cycle engine E is activated. With this configuration, it is possible to prevent oil from adhering on the catalyst, and hence to promote the activation of the catalyst and more effectively prevent the occurrence of white smoke.<br>
To achieve the above second object, there is provided an oil recovery system for a two-cycle engine of a motorcycle, in which an oil recovery chamber disposed under a crank chamber of a two-cycle engine mounted on a motorcycle and communicated to a bottom of the crank chamber is formed in an oil recovery tank supported by the engine and the oil recovery chamber is connected to an intake system of the engine, characterized in that the oil recovery tank is provided with a partition wall for partitioning the inside of the oil recovery chamber into an upper chamber communicated to the bottom of the crank chamber and a<br><br><br>
lower chamber connected to the intake system; the partition wall is formed into a funnel shape which allows the flow area of oil to be reduced toward the lower side; and a communication hole for communicating the upper chamber to the lower chamber is provided at the lowermost end of the partition wall. [0013]<br>
With this configuration, oil led from the crank chamber into the oil recovery chamber flows from the upper chamber to the lower chamber through the communication hole.  In this case, since the partition wall is formed into the funnel shape, the diameter of the communication -hole can be set at a "relatively small" value. As a result, it is possible to enhance the efficiency of recovery of oil from the crank chamber, by setting the flow areas of the connecting pipe and the oil lead pipe, which connect the crank chamber to the oil recovery chamber, at relatively large values while suppressing the pressure loss in the crank chamber accompanied by the return of oil to the intake system side by depression at an engine manifold thereby preventing the reduction in engine performance.  Further, since the amount of oil, which counter-flows from the oil recovery chamber to the crank chamber side due to pressure pulsation of the crank<br><br><br>
chamber, vibration from a running road surface, and vibration of the engine, can be minimized by the partition wall and the communication hole, it is possible to further enhance the efficiency of oil recovery.<br>
According to the invention, one end of an oil lead pipe is connected to the bottom of the crank chamber at a position which becomes the lowermost end in the tilting state of the body of the motorcycle when a side stand is kept in the working state and the other end of the oil lead pipe is connected to the upper chamber. With this configuration, it is possible to effectively recover oil from the crank chamber by making use of the tilting of the body of the motorcycle in the state in which the body is tilted when the side stand is kept in the working state.<br>

[0026]<br>
Referring particularly to Fig. 5, one end of the crank shaft 28 projects in a transmission chamber 53 partitioned from the crank chamber 33.  The transmission chamber 53 is formed by the crank case 24 and a transmission case 54 connected to the crank case 24.  Oil is accumulated in the transmission chamber 53 up to a liquid level L- shown in Fig. 5.<br>
[0027]<br>
The transmission chamber 53 houses a multi-stage transmission 57 composed of a plurality of stages of gear trains allowed to be alternatively meshed.  The transmission 57 is positioned between a main shaft 55 and a counter shaft 56.  The main shaft 55 has an axial line parallel to that of the crank shaft 28 and is rotatably supported by the transmission case 54, and the counter shaft 56 has an axial line parallel to that of the main shaft 55 and is rotatably supported by the transmission case 54.

The other end of the crank shaft 28 projects in an auxiliary chamber 60 partitioned from the crank chamber 33 and the transmission chamber 53, and a generator is connected to the other end of the crank shaft 2 8 in the auxiliary chamber 60. [0029]<br>
At- the boundary between the crank chamber 33 'and the transmission chamber 53, a first oil seal 61 and a first ball bearing 62 offset to the transmission chamber 53 side from the first oil seal 61 are provided between the crank shaft 28 and the crank case 24.  At the boundary between the crank chamber 33 and the auxiliary chamber 60, a second oil seal 63, a third oil seal 64 offset to the auxiliary chamber 60 side from the second oil seal 63, and a second ball bearing 65 positioned between the second and third oil seals 63 and 64 are provided between the crank shaft 28 and the crank case 24. [0030]<br><br><br>
An oil-tight space 66 is formed between the second and third oil seals 63 and 64 in the crank case 24.  In the oil-tight space 66, a drive screw gear 67 is provided on the crank shaft 28, and a driven screw gear 68 having an axial line perpendicular to an axial line of the crank shaft 28 is meshed with the drive screw gear 67.  The driven screw gear 68 is connected to an oil pump (not shown), and the oil pump is driven by the crank shaft 28. [0031]<br>
A mission gear 69, which constitutes part of the transmission 57, is rotated in the direction shown by an arrow in Fig. 5, with its outer periphery being in proximity to a- plane, facing to the'" transmission chamber 53, of the crank case" 24.  Oil in the transmission chamber 53 is splashed up by the mission gear ^69.  Meanwhile, the-crank case 24 has an oil receiving portion 70 integrally projecting from a portion over the mission gear 69 into the transmission chamber 53.  The oil receiving portion 70 is allowed to receive part of oil splashed up by the mission gear 69. [0032]<br>
The crank case 24 has an oil supply hole 71 with its one end opened to the transmission chamber 53 and the other end opened to the oil-tight space 66, and an oil<br><br><br>
discharge hole 72 with its one end opened to the oil-tight space 66 and the other end opened to an inner bottom of the transmission chamber 53. A lower edge of the one end, opened to the transmission chamber 53, of the oil supply hole 71 is formed in such a manner as to be continuous to the upper surface of the oil receiving portion 70.

oil-tight space 66 at a position between the third oil seal 64 and the second ball bearing 65.  That is to say, the other end of the oil supply hole 71 and the one end of the oil discharge hole 72 are opened in the oil-tight space 66 at the positions between which the second ball bearing 65 is put.<br>
[0035]<br>
Oil supplied together with air-fuel mixture, and oil supplied to a lubrication portion of the engine E are accumulated on the inner bottom of the crank chamber 33, and the oil thus accumulated is recovered from the crank chamber 33 and returned to the intake system 38.  To recover -such oil, an oil recovery tank '7 6 including'an oil recover chamber 75 communicated to the bottom of the crank chamber 33 is disposed under the two-cycle engine E<br>
[0036]<br>
Referring particularly to Fig. 6, the oil recovery tank 76 includes a tank main body 77, and a cover plate 78 fastened to a side surface of the tank main body 77 by means of a plurality of, for example, four bolts 79.  The tank main body 77 is integrally provided with two supporting arms 80 and 81 extending upwardly, and upper ends of the supporting arms 80 and 81 are fastened to the crank case 24 of the two-cycle engine E.  In this way, the<br><br>
oil recovery tank 76 is supported by the two-cycle engine E in such a manner as to be disposed under the engine E. [0037]<br>
The oil recovery chamber 75 is formed by closing an opening end of a  circular recess provided  in   the  tank main body 77 with the cover plate 78.  An annular seal member 82 surrounding the recess is interposed between the tank main body 77 and the cover plate 78. [0038]<br>
The oil recovery chamber 75 is partitioned into an upper chamber 75a and a lower chamber 75b by means of a partition wall 83 provided on the tank main body 77. The partition wall- 83 is formed into a funnel shape which allows the flow area "of oil to be reduced toward the lower side. A communication hole 84 for communicating the-upper chamber 75a to the lower chamber 75b is provided at the lowermost end of the partition wall 83.  To be more specific, when the motorcycle is parked with the side stand 21 kept in the working state, the body of the motorcycle is, as shown in Fig. 3, tilted sideways from the vertical direction by an angle a ,   and the communication hole 84 is provided in the partition wall 83 r   typicallyr   at an  end  on   the cover plate  18  side in such a manner that the communication hole 84 is located<br><br>
at the lowermost end of the partition wall 83 in the above tilting state of the body of the motorcycle.<br>

A connection pipe 85 communicated to the inner bottom of the crank chamber 33 is mounted to the crank case 24 at a position which becomes the lowermost end in the tilting state of the body of the motorcycle when the side stand 21 is kept in the working state.  One end of an oil lead pipe 86 is connected to the connection pipe 85, and the other end of the oil lead pipe 86 is connected to the upper chamber 7 5a. .<br>
[0040]<br>
Referring particularly to Fig 7, a cover 88 is fastened to the tank main body 77 of the oil recovery tank 76. with a partition plate 87 put ./between the cover -88 and the tank main body 77 by means of a plurality of, for example, four bolts 89. An inlet chamber 91, which is communicated to the lower chamber 75b of the oil recovery chamber 75 via a passage 90 provided in the tank main body 77, is formed between the tank main body 77 and the partition plate 87, and an outlet chamber 92 is formed between the partition plate 87 and the cover 88. A seal member 93 surrounding the inlet chamber 91 is interposed between the tank main body 77 and the partition plate 87,<br><br>
and a seal member 94 surrounding the outlet chamber 92 is interposed between the partition plate 87 and the cover 88. [0041]<br>
A check valve  95   is  disposed  in  an  upper portion  of the partition plate 87.  The check valve 95 includes a holding cylinder 97 pressed in a mounting hole 96 and a disk-shaped valve body 98 housed in the holding cylinder 97.  The mounting hole 96 is formed in the upper portion of the partition plate 87 in such a manner as to communicate the inlet chamber 91 to the outlet chamber 92 [0042]<br>
The holding cylinder 97 with its bottom close'd is pressed in the mounting hole 96 with its closed bottom disposed on the inlet chamber 91 side, A valve hole 99 i<s formed at a central portion of the closed bottom holding cylinder valve body which is housed in allowed to be sit on thereby close hole plurality restricting projections for preventing from being removed are provided inner surface opening end side such manner as project></s>
 <br>
inwardly therefrom. [0043]<br>
The check valve 95 allows the flow of oil from the inlet chamber 91 side to the outlet chamber 92 side, but prohibits the flow of oil from the outlet chamber 92 side to the inlet chamber 91 side. [0044]<br>
Referring particularly to Fig. 2, a connection pipe<br>
101	is mounted to a portion, corresponding to the check valve 95, of the cover 88.  One end of a return pipe line<br>
102	is connected to the connection pipe 101, and the other end of the return pipe line 102 is connected to the intake system -38.  A control valve 103  is provided at a halfway point of the return pipe line 102.<br>
[0045] .<br>
The control valve 103 is an electromagnetic switching valve having first, second and third ports 104, 105 and 106.  The control valve 103 can switch a communication state of the first, second and third ports 104, 105 and 106 from or to a state in which the first port 104 is communicated to the second port 105 and is cutoff from the third port 106 to or from a state in which the first port 1Q4 is communicated to the third port 106 and is cutoff from the second port 105.<br><br>
[0046]<br>
The return pipe line 102 includes a first pipe line portion 102a and a second pipe line portion 102b.  One end of the first pipe line portion 102a is connected to the connection pipe 101, and the other end of the first pipe line portion 102a is connected to the first port 104 of the control valve 103.  One end of the second pipe line portion 102b is connected to the second port 105 of the control valve 103, and the other end of the second pipe line portion 102b is connected to a portion, located between the throttle valve 41 and the reed valve 37 of the intake system 38, that is, the intake pipe 43. [0047]<br>
One end of an 'open pipe line 107 raised upwardly from the control valve 103 is connected to the third port 106 of the control valve 103.  The other end of the open pipe line 107 is opened to atmospheric air on the upstream side from the cleaner element 39 in the air cleaner 40. [0048]<br>
The control valve 103 is controlled by control means (not shown) as follows: namely, in a period until the engine state reaches a specific warming state after start-up of the two-cycle engine E and in the stoppage<br><br>
state of the two-cycle engine E, the control valve 103 switches the communication state of the ports 104, 105 and 106 into the state in which the first port 104 is communicated to the third port 106 and is cutoff from the second port 105 in order to prohibit the return of oil from the oil recovery chamber 75 to the intake system 38; and after the engine state reaches the specific warming state, the control valve 103 switches the communication state of the ports 104, 105 and 106 into the state in which the first port 104 is communicated to the second port 105 and is cutoff from the third port 106.<br>
[0049]<br>
 That is to say, in the period until the engine state reaches the specific warming state after start-up of the two-cycle engine E and in the stoppage state of the two-cycle engine E, the return pipe line 102 is cutoff so that the oil recovery chamber 75 is connected to the inside of the air cleaner 40 via the check valve 95.<br>
[0050]<br>
The above-described specific warming state is set as a state in which catalyst in the catalyst device 50 provided in the exhaust system 47 of the two-cycle engine E is activated.  The activation of catalyst is decided by<br><br>
detecting the temperature in the inside of the catalyst device 50, or decided on the basis of a condition that a state in which the number of revolution of the two-cycle engine E is a setting number of revolution (for example, 3000 rpm) or more is continued for a setting time (for example, one minute) or more. [0051]<br>
The function of this embodiment will be described below. At the boundary between the crank chamber 33 and the auxiliary chamber -60, the second and third oil seals 63 and 64 are provided between the crank case 24 and the crank shaft 28 so that the oil-tight space 66 is formed between- the oil seals 63 and 64 in the crank case 24', and the second ball bearing 65 provided between the crank case 24. and the crank shaft 28 is hous-ed in the oil--tight space 66.  To lubricate the second ball bearing 65, the oil receiving portion 70 capable of receiving oil in the transmission chamber 53 splashed up by the mission gear 69 is integrally provided on a portion, positioned over the mission gear 70, of the crank case 24.  The oil supply hole 71 with its one end opened to the transmission chamber 53 and the other end opened to the oil-tight space 66 is provided in the crank case 24 in such a manner that the lower edge of the one end, opened to the<br><br>
transmission chamber 53, of the oil supply hole 71 is continuous to the upper surface of the oil receiving portion 70. The oil discharge hole 72 with its one end opened to the oil-tight space 66 and the other end opened on the lower bottom of the transmission chamber 53 is also provided in the crank case 24. [0052]<br>
Accordingly, oil splashed by the mission gear 69 in the transmission chamber 53 is supplied from the oil receiving portion 70 into the oil-tight space 66 via the oil supply hole 71 to lubricate the second ball bearing 65, and the oil is returned from the oil-tight space 66 into the—transmission chamber 53 via ttie oil discharge hole 72.  Such a structure for lubricating the second ball bearing 65 can be obtained only by forming the oil -supply hole 71 and the oil discharge hole 72 in the crank case 24.  The simple lubricating structure is advantageous in reducing the number of the machining steps as compared with the conventional lubricating structure in which an oil passage is formed in the crank shaft 28. [0053]<br>
Since the other end of the oil supply hole 71 and the one end of the oil discharge hole 7 2 are opened in the oil-tight space 66  at the positions between which the<br><br>
second ball bearing 65 is put, oil flows in the oil-tight space 66 while necessarily passing through the second ball bearing 65. As a result,.the second ball bearing 65 is certainly lubricated with oil flowing in the oil-tight space 66.<br>
[0054]<br>
Since the oil supply hole 71 is provided in the<br>
crank case 24 in such a manner as to have the axial line<br>
parallel to the bolts 44 screwed in the crank case 24 for<br>
fastening the reed valve 37 to the crank case 24, the oil<br>
supply hole 71 and the threaded holes in which the bolts<br>
44 are to be screwed can be formed in the crank case 24<br>
in the same direction.  As a result, is possible to<br>
form the oil supply hole 71 with good machinability and<br>
productivity.	J	-<br>
[0055]<br>
To recover oil accumulated on the lower bottom of the crank chamber 3 3 from the crank chamber 3 3 and to return the oil to the intake system 38, the oil recovery tank 76 including the oil recovery chamber 75 communicated to the bottom of the crank chamber 33 is disposed under the two-cycle engine E.  The oil recovery tank 76 has the partition wall 83 for partitioning the inside of the oil recovery chamber 75 into the upper<br><br><br>
chamber 75a communicated to the bottom of the crank chamber 33 and the lower chamber 75b connected to the intake system 38.  The partition wall 83 is formed into the funnel shape which allows the flow area of oil to be reduced toward the lower side.  The communication hole 84 for communicating the upper chamber 75a to the lower chamber 75b is provided at the lowermost end of the partition wall 83. [0056]<br>
Accordingly, oil led from the crank chamber 33 into the oil recovery chamber 75 flows from the upper chamber 75a to the lower chamber 75b through the communication hole 84-. —Further, since the partition wall 83 is formed into the funnel shape, the diameter of the communication hole 84. can be set at a relatively small value. As-a result, it is possible to enhance the efficiency of recovery of oil from the crank chamber 33 by setting the flow areas of the connecting pipe 85 and the oil lead pipe 86, which connect the crank chamber 33 to the oil recovery chamber 75, at relatively large values while suppressing the pressure loss in the crank chamber 33 accompanied by the return of oil to the intake system 38 side by depression at an engine manifold thereby preventing the reduction in engine performance.  Further,<br><br>
since the amount of oil, which counter-flows from the oil recovery chamber 75 to the crank chamber 33 side due to pressure pulsation of the crank chamber 33, vibration from a running road surface, and vibration of the engine E, can be minimized by the partition wall 83 and the communication hole 84, it is possible to further enhance the efficiency of oil recovery.<br>
[0057]<br>
Since the one end of the oil lead pipe 86 is connected to the lower bottom of the crank chamber 33 at a position which becomes the lowermost end in the tilting state of the body of the motorcycle when the side stand 21 is kept in -the working state and" the other end of' the oil lead pipe 86 is connected to the upper chamber 75a, it is possible to effectively recover .oil from the-crank - • chamber 33 by making use of the tilting of the body of the motorcycle in the state in which the body is tilted when the side stand 21 is kept in the working state.<br>
[0058]<br>
The control valve 103 for prohibiting the return of oil from the oil recovery chamber 75 to the intake system 38 until the engine state reaches the specific warming state after start-up of the two-cycle engine E is provided at a halfway point of the return pipe line 102<br><br>
for returning the oil recovered to the oil recovery chamber 75 to the intake system 38. Accordingly, even by performing a snapping operation before the engine state reaches the warming state, the oil is not returned to the intake system 38, with a result that it is possible to certainly prevent the occurrence of while smoke. [0059]<br>
The control valve 103 is the electromagnetic switching valve operated to alternatively switch, the communication state of the first port 104 connected to the oil recovery chamber 75 via the check valve 95, the second port 105 connected to the intake system 38, and the third port- 106, between the state"" in which the first port 104 is communicated to the second port 105 and the state in which the first port 104 is communicated to the third port 106.  The open pipe line 107 with its one end connected to the third port 106 is raised upwardly from the control valve 103, and the other end of the open pipe line 107 is opened to atmospheric air in the air cleaner 40. [0060]<br>
Accordingly, in the state in which the return of oil to the intake system 38 is prohibited by cutting off the communication between the first and second ports 104<br><br><br>
and 105 and allowing the communication between the first and third ports 104 and 106, the oil recover chamber 75 does not become an enclosed state, with a result that the recovery of oil from the crank chamber 33 to the oil recovery chamber 75 can be desirably performed.  Further, since the open pipe line 107 communicated to the third port 106 is raised upwardly from the control valve 103, it is possible to prevent oil from flowing on the open pipe line 107 side. [0061]<br>
Since the oil recovery chamber 75 is connected to a portion, positioned between the throttle valve 39 and the reed valve 37,- of the intake system'" 3B via the return pipe line 102, it is'possible to prevent oil returned to the intake system 3 8 from adhering on the throttle -valve 39 and hence to improve the workability of the throttle valve 39, and to promote atomization of return oil supplied to the crank chamber 33 side by action of the reed valve 37 and hence to improve the combustibility of oil and more effectively prevent the occurrence of white smoke. [0062]<br>
Since the specific warming state is set as the state in which catalyst in the catalyst device 50<br><br>
provided in the exhaust system 47 of the two-cycle engine E is activated, it is possible to prevent oil from adhering on the catalyst, and hence to promote the activation of the catalyst and more effectively prevent the occurrence of white smoke. [0063]<br>
While the embodiment of the present invention has been described in detail, the present invention is not limited thereto, and it is to be understood that various changes in design may be made without departing from the scope of the present invention described in claims. [0064]<br>
For example, although the control valve 103 is provided at a halfway point of the return pipe line 102 in the embodiment, it may. be mounted an the oil recovery tank 76. [0065]<br>
[Effect of the Invention]<br>
According to the invention since the return of oil from the oil recovery chamber to the intake system is prohibited by the control valve until the engine state reaches the specific warming state directly after start-up of the two-cycle engine, oil is not returned to the intake system even by a snapping<br><br><br>
operation before the engine state reaches the warming state, with a result that it is possible to certainly prevent the occurrence of white smoke. [0066]<br>
According to the invention since the oil recover chamber does not become an enclosed state in the state in which the return of oil to the intake system is prohibit, the recovery of oil from the crank chamber to the oil recovery chamber can be desirably performed.  Further, it is possible to prevent oil from flowing on the open pipe line side.<br>
