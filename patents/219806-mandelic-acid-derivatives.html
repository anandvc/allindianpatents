Further, the invention is concerned with a process for the manufecture of the above compounds, pharmaceutical preparations which contain such compounds as well as the use of these compounds for the production of pharmaceutical preparations.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) are active compounds and inhibit the formation of coagulation &amp;ctors Xa, IXa and thrombin induced by fector Vila and tissue fector or are<br><br>
derivatives which are converted under physiological conditions to such active compounds. These compounds consequently influence both platelet aggregation which is induced by these factors and plasmatic blood coagulation. They therefore inhibit the formation of thrombi and can be used for the treatment and/or prevention of diseases, such as arterial and venous thrombosis, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac infarction, stroke due to atrial fibrillation, inflammation and arteriosclerosis. Furthermore, these compounds have an effect on tumour cells and prevent metastases. They can therefore also be used as antitumour agents.<br>
Inhibitorsof factor Vlla had previously been suggested for the inhibition of the formation of thrombi and for the treatment of related diseases (WO 00/35858). However, there is still a need for novel factor Vlla inhibitors which exhibit improved pharmacological properties.<br>
The present invention provides the novel compounds of formula (I) which are factor Vila inhibitors. The compounds of the present invention exhibit improved pharmacological properties compared to the known compounds.<br>

It will be appreciated that the compounds of general formula (I) in this invention maybe derivatised at ftmctional groups to provide derivatives virhich are capable of conversion back to the parent compound in vivo.<br><br>
The invention further relates to a process for the manufacture of conipounds of formula (I) as defined above, which process comprises converting the nitrile group in a compound of formula (H)<br><br>
wherein R2 R2 R2 R2 R2 R2 R2 R1, R2", X and Y have the significances given above, into a carbamimidoyl group, or into a N-hydroxy-caibamimidoyl group, or into a N-amino-carbamimidoyl group, and, if desired, converting an obtained compound of formula (I) into a phannaceutically acceptable salt. A preferred process as described above comprises the conversion of the nitrile group into a carbamamidoyl group, or into a N-hydroxy-carbamimidojd group, or into a N-amino-carbannmidoyl group.<br>
The conversion of the nitrile group in a compound of formula II into a carbamimidoyl group -C{NH)NH2 or into a N-hydroxy-carbamimidoyl group -C(NOH)NH2 or into a N-amino-carbamimidouyi group -C(N-NH2)NH2 can be carried out according to methods known per se. For example, the conversion into a N-hydroxy-carbamimidoyl group can be performed by dissolving a compound of formula n in a solvent, such as DMF, ethanol or methanol, treating the solution with hydroxylamine or a salt of hydroxylamine with an inorganic acid, such as hydroxylamine hydrochloride, and thereafter with a base, such as diisopropylethylamine or triethylamine, sodium hydride or sodium methanolate, conveniently at a temperature up to 80°C.<br>
The conversion of the nitrile group into a carbamimidoyl group can be carried out e.g. by treating a compound of formula II in a solvent, such as ethanol or methanol, or a solvent mixture, such as chloroform and methanol or chloroform and ethanol, with a dry stream of hydrogen chloride, conveniently at a temperature below 10 °C. The solution containing the iminoether can be evaporated and the residue can be treated with gaseous<br><br>
ammonia or an ammonium salt in methanol or ethanol. In an analogous manner, the iminoether can be converted into a N-hydroxy-carbamimidoyl compound of formula I with hydroxyiamine or a salt thereof in the presence of a base or into a N-amino-caibamimidoyl compound of formula I with hydrazine or a salt thereof in the presence of a base. In so doing, other reactive groups present in the compound of formula I and reactive towards the treatment wih hydrogen chloride or gaseous ammonia or ammonium chloride or hydroxyiamine or hydrazine can be modified. For example, in the case of treatment with hydrogen chloride a benzjdoxy group R6, R2, R2, R1, R2, R1, R1° or R6 can be converted into the hydroxy group. In the case of treatment with gaseous ammonia in methanol or ethanol a lower-alkoxy-carbonyl-lower-alkoxy group R2 R1, R6*, R2 R2 R2, R2° or R6 can be converted into a carbamo)d-lower-alkoxy group.<br>
If a carbamimidoyl compound of formula (I) is obtained from a nitrile of formula (U) by treatment with hydrogen chloride and subsequent reaction with gaseous ammonia or ammonium chloride, the carbamimidoyl product is obtained as hydrochloride salt. This salt can be converted into any other pharmaceutically acceptable salt by thromatography over an adequately charged basic ion exchange resin. Alternatively the hydrochloride salt of a carbamimidoyl compound of formula (I) can be converted into the corresponding free base by treatment with sodium ethanolate in ethanol and subsequently treated with an excess of an appropriate acid to generate any pharmaceutically acceptable salt.<br>
Any pharmaceutically acceptable salt of a carbamimidoyl compound of formula (I) can ftirthermore be obtained when a N-hydroxy-carbamimidoyl compound of formula (I) is hydrogenated in a solvent like ethanol, methanol, dioxan or THF, with hydrogen and a catalyst such as palladium, platinum or nickel in the presence of an appropriate acid.<br>
Functional groups in compounds of formula (I) can be modified. As modifications of functional groups in a compound of formula I there come into consideration especially the conversion of a N-hydroxy-carbamimidojd group into a carbamimidoyl group, the esterification of a carboxy group, the saponification of an ester group and the cleavage of an ether group, such as an arylalkyl ether group, e.g. the benzjd ether group. All of these reactions can be carried out according to methods known per se.<br>
A compound of formula (I) in which R1 represents a hydroxy group can be converted into a compound of formula (I) in which R2 represents hydrogen by hydrogenation in a solvent, such as ethanol, methanol, dioxane, THF or ^cial acetic add, or a solvent mixture, such as ethanol and glacial acetic add, with hydrogen and a catalyst, such as palladium, platinum or nickel. In so doing, other reactive groups present in the compound of formula I and reactive towards the reducing agent can be modified.<br><br>
A compound of formula (I) in which R2 represents benzyloxy-carbonyl can be converted into a compound of formula (I) in which R represents hydrogen by hydrogenation in a solvent, such as ethanol, methanol, dioxane, THF oi glacial acetic acid, or a solvent mixture, such as ethanol and glacial acetic acid, with hydrogen and a catalyst, such as palladiimi. The reaction can be optionally performed in the presence of an acid such as HCl in a solvent such as EtOH or MeOH. In so doing, other reactive groups present in the compound of formula I and reactive towards the reducing agent can be modified.<br>
A compound of formula (I) in which R2 represents lower-alkoxy-carbonyl or aryl-lower-alkoxy-caibonyl is obtdned by reacting a compound of formula (I) in which R2 represents hydrogen with a chlorofonnic add lower alkyl ester or a chloroformic acid aryl-lower-alkyl ester in a solvent, such as dichloromethane, dioxane or DMF, or a solvent mbcture, such as dichloromethane and water or ethyl acetate and water, in the presence of an organic base, such as pyridine or triethylamine, or an inorganic base, such as sodiimi hydroxide, sodium carbonate or potassium bicarbonate.<br>

Tlie inhibition of tie amidolytic acdvity of factor Vila/tissue fector complex by the compounds in accordance with the invention can be demonstrated with the aid of a chromogenic peptide substrate as described hereinafter.<br>
The measurements were carried out by an automated robotic assay on microtitre plates at room temperature. To this end, 100 pi. of a solution of 26 nM of tissue fector, 9 nM of soluble ^ctor Vila and 8 mhi of caldum chloride were added to 25 jil of a solution of the inhibitor in a buffer [pH 7.5, lOO mM, comprising O.UM NaCl, O.IM N-(2-hydroxyethyl)piperazine-N'-(2-elhanesulphomc acid) (HEPES), 0.5 mg/1 of fatty-acid-free BSA (bovine serum albumin} and 0.05% NaNj] in each well of the plate. After an incubation time of 15 minutes the reaction was started by the addition of 50 jU of chromogenic substrate Chromozym-tPA {3,5 mM, MeSOj-D-Phe-GIy-Ai^-paranitroaniHde) and the hydrolysis of the substrate was followed spectrophotometrically on a kinetic microtitre plate reader over 10 minutes. Using the plot of the inhibition curves, the Ki values were determined according to the method described in Biochem. J. 55, 1953, 170-171.<br>
The activity of the low molecular weight substances can, moreover, be characterized in the "prothrombin time" (FT) clotting test. The substances are prepared as a 10 mM solution in DMSO or DMSO/O.IM HQ (DHCl) and thereafter made up to the desbed dilution in the same solvent Thereafter, 0.25 ml of human plasma (obtained from whole blood anticoa^ulated with 1/10 volume of 108 mM Na dtrate) was placed in the instrument-specific sample container. In each case 5 ^ of each dilution of the substance-dilution series was then mixed with the plasma provided. This plasma/inhibitor mixture was incubated at 37°C for 2 minutes. Thereafter, there were pipetted to the semi-automatic device (ACL, Automated Coagulation Laboratory (Instrument Laboratory)) 50 ^il of plasma/ inhibitor mixture in the measurement container. The dotting reaction was initiated by the addition of 0.1 ml of Innovin® (recombinant human tissue factor combined with caldum buffer and synthetic phosphoHpids( Dade Behring®, Inc.). The time up to the fibrin cross-linking was determined photoopticaUy from the ACL. The inhibitor concentration, which brought about a doubling of the PT dotting time, was determined by means of a graph.<br>
The Ki value of the active compounds of the present invention preferably amounts to about O.OOI to 50 jiM.espedally about O.OOI Co I fxM. The PT values preferably amount to about 1 to 100 |iM, espedaliy to about 1 to 10 (AM.<br><br><br><br>
The compounds of formxJa I and/or their pharmaceutically acceptable salts can be used as medicaments, e.g. in the form of pharmaceutical preparations for enteral, parenteral or topical administration. They can be administered, for example, perorally, e.g. in the form of tablets, coated tablets, dragees, hard and soft gelatine capsules, solutions, emulsions or suspensions, rectaUy, e.g. in the form of suppositories, parenterally, e.g. in the form of injection solutions or suspensions or infusion solutions, or topically, e,g. in the form of ointments, creams or oils. Oral administration is preferred.<br>
The production of the pharmaceutical preparations can be effected in a manner which will be ^miliar to any person skilled in the art by bringing the described compounds of formula I and/or their pharmaceutically acceptable salts, optionally in combination with other therapeutically valuable substances, into a galenical administration form together with suitable, non-toxic, inert, therapeutically compatible solid or liquid carrier materials and, if desired, usual pharmaceutical adjuvants.<br>
Suitable carrier materials are not only inorganic carrier materials, but also organic carrier materials. Thus, for example, lactose, com starch or derivatives thereof, talc, stearic acid or its salts can be used as carrier materials for tablets, coated tablets, dragees and hard gelatine capsules. Suitable carrier materials for soft gelatine capsules are, for example, vegetable oils, waxes, fets and semi-solid and liquid polyols (depending on the nature of the active ingredient no carriers might, however, be required in the case of soft gelatine capsules). Suitable carrier materials for the production of solutions and syrups are, for example, water, polyols, sucrose, invert sugar and the like. Suitable carrier materials for injection solutions are, for example, water, alcohols, polyols, glycerol and vegetable oUs. Suitable carrier materials for suppositories are, for example, natural or hardened oils, waxes, fats and semi-liquid or liquid polyols. Suitable carrier materials for topical preparations are glycerides, semi-synthetic and synthetic glycerides, hydrogenated oils, hquid waxes, Hquid paraffins, liquid fatty alcohols, sterols, polyethylene glycols and cellulose derivatives.<br>
Usual stabilizers, preservatives, wetting and emulsifying agents, consistency-improving agents, flavour-improving agents, salts for varying the osmotic pressm-e, buffer substances, solubilizers, colorants and masking agents and antioxidants come into consideration as pharmaceutical adjuvants.<br>
The dosage of the compounds of formula I can vary within wide limits depending on die disease to be controlled, the age and the individual condition of the patient and the mode of administration, and will, of course, be fitted to the individual requirements in each particular case. For adult patients a daily dosage of about 1 to 1000 iR2, especially<br><br>
about 1 to 100 mg, comes into consideration. Dependii^ on severity of the disease and the precise pharmacokinetic profile the compound could be administered with one or several daily dosage units, eg. in J to 3 dosage units.<br>
The pharmaceutical preparations conveniently contain about 1-500 mg, preferably 1-100 mg, of a compound of formula I.<br>

The compounds of formula (I) are active compounds and inhibit the formation of coagulation &amp;ctors Xa, IXa and thrombin induced by fector Vila and tissue fector or are<br><br>
derivatives which are converted under physiological conditions to such active compounds. These compounds consequently influence both platelet aggregation which is induced by these factors and plasmatic blood coagulation. They therefore inhibit the formation of thrombi and can be used for the treatment and/or prevention of diseases, such as arterial and venous thrombosis, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac infarction, stroke due to atrial fibrillation, inflammation and arteriosclerosis. Furthermore, these compounds have an effect on tumour cells and prevent metastases. They can therefore also be used as antitumour agents.<br>
Inhibitorsof factor Vlla had previously been suggested for the inhibition of the formation of thrombi and for the treatment of related diseases (WO 00/35858). However, there is still a need for novel factor Vlla inhibitors which exhibit improved pharmacological properties.<br>
The present invention provides the novel compounds of formula (I) which are factor Vila inhibitors. The compounds of the present invention exhibit improved pharmacological properties compared to the known compounds.<br>

The invention further relates to a process for the manufacture of conipounds of formula (I) as defined above, which process comprises converting the nitrile group in a compound of formula (H)<br><br>
wherein R2 R2 R2 R2 R2 R2 R2 R1, R2", X and Y have the significances given above, into a carbamimidoyl group, or into a N-hydroxy-caibamimidoyl group, or into a N-amino-carbamimidoyl group, and, if desired, converting an obtained compound of formula (I) into a phannaceutically acceptable salt. A preferred process as described above comprises the conversion of the nitrile group into a carbamamidoyl group, or into a N-hydroxy-carbamimidojd group, or into a N-amino-carbannmidoyl group.<br>
The conversion of the nitrile group in a compound of formula II into a carbamimidoyl group -C{NH)NH2 or into a N-hydroxy-carbamimidoyl group -C(NOH)NH2 or into a N-amino-carbamimidouyi group -C(N-NH2)NH2 can be carried out according to methods known per se. For example, the conversion into a N-hydroxy-carbamimidoyl group can be performed by dissolving a compound of formula n in a solvent, such as DMF, ethanol or methanol, treating the solution with hydroxylamine or a salt of hydroxylamine with an inorganic acid, such as hydroxylamine hydrochloride, and thereafter with a base, such as diisopropylethylamine or triethylamine, sodium hydride or sodium methanolate, conveniently at a temperature up to 80°C.<br>
The conversion of the nitrile group into a carbamimidoyl group can be carried out e.g. by treating a compound of formula II in a solvent, such as ethanol or methanol, or a solvent mixture, such as chloroform and methanol or chloroform and ethanol, with a dry stream of hydrogen chloride, conveniently at a temperature below 10 °C. The solution containing the iminoether can be evaporated and the residue can be treated with gaseous<br><br>
ammonia or an ammonium salt in methanol or ethanol. In an analogous manner, the iminoether can be converted into a N-hydroxy-carbamimidoyl compound of formula I with hydroxyiamine or a salt thereof in the presence of a base or into a N-amino-caibamimidoyl compound of formula I with hydrazine or a salt thereof in the presence of a base. In so doing, other reactive groups present in the compound of formula I and reactive towards the treatment wih hydrogen chloride or gaseous ammonia or ammonium chloride or hydroxyiamine or hydrazine can be modified. For example, in the case of treatment with hydrogen chloride a benzjdoxy group R6, R2, R2, R1, R2, R1, R1° or R6 can be converted into the hydroxy group. In the case of treatment with gaseous ammonia in methanol or ethanol a lower-alkoxy-carbonyl-lower-alkoxy group R2 R1, R6*, R2 R2 R2, R2° or R6 can be converted into a carbamo)d-lower-alkoxy group.<br>
If a carbamimidoyl compound of formula (I) is obtained from a nitrile of formula (U) by treatment with hydrogen chloride and subsequent reaction with gaseous ammonia or ammonium chloride, the carbamimidoyl product is obtained as hydrochloride salt. This salt can be converted into any other pharmaceutically acceptable salt by thromatography over an adequately charged basic ion exchange resin. Alternatively the hydrochloride salt of a carbamimidoyl compound of formula (I) can be converted into the corresponding free base by treatment with sodium ethanolate in ethanol and subsequently treated with an excess of an appropriate acid to generate any pharmaceutically acceptable salt.<br>
Any pharmaceutically acceptable salt of a carbamimidoyl compound of formula (I) can ftirthermore be obtained when a N-hydroxy-carbamimidoyl compound of formula (I) is hydrogenated in a solvent like ethanol, methanol, dioxan or THF, with hydrogen and a catalyst such as palladium, platinum or nickel in the presence of an appropriate acid.<br>
Functional groups in compounds of formula (I) can be modified. As modifications of functional groups in a compound of formula I there come into consideration especially the conversion of a N-hydroxy-carbamimidojd group into a carbamimidoyl group, the esterification of a carboxy group, the saponification of an ester group and the cleavage of an ether group, such as an arylalkyl ether group, e.g. the benzjd ether group. All of these reactions can be carried out according to methods known per se.<br>
A compound of formula (I) in which R1 represents a hydroxy group can be converted into a compound of formula (I) in which R2 represents hydrogen by hydrogenation in a solvent, such as ethanol, methanol, dioxane, THF or ^cial acetic add, or a solvent mixture, such as ethanol and glacial acetic add, with hydrogen and a catalyst, such as palladium, platinum or nickel. In so doing, other reactive groups present in the compound of formula I and reactive towards the reducing agent can be modified.<br><br>
A compound of formula (I) in which R2 represents benzyloxy-carbonyl can be converted into a compound of formula (I) in which R represents hydrogen by hydrogenation in a solvent, such as ethanol, methanol, dioxane, THF oi glacial acetic acid, or a solvent mixture, such as ethanol and glacial acetic acid, with hydrogen and a catalyst, such as palladiimi. The reaction can be optionally performed in the presence of an acid such as HCl in a solvent such as EtOH or MeOH. In so doing, other reactive groups present in the compound of formula I and reactive towards the reducing agent can be modified.<br>
