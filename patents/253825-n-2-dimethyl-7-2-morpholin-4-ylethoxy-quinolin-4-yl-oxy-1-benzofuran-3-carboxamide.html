FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This application claims priority to United States Patent Application No. 60/532,725, filed December 23, 2003, which is hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
This invention relates to novel quinoline analogs and derivatives thereof, including pharmaceutically acceptable derivatives, such as salts, and solvates. The compounds of the present invention inhibit the activity of receptor kinases such as VEGFR and PDGRF that are required for cell growth and differentiation and angiogenesis. Particularly, the compounds in this invention inhibit VEGFR/KDR and therefore are useful for treatment of diseases and conditions that are associated with VEGFR/KDR activity, e.g., cancer and ophthalmic diseases such as age-related macular degeneration. This invention also relates to a method of using such compounds in the treatment of hyperproliferative diseases in mammals, especially humans, and to pharmaceutical compositions containing such compounds.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
A cell may become cancerous by virtue of the transformation of a portion of its DNA into an oncogene (i.e., a gene that upon activation leads to the formation of malignant tumor cells). Many oncogenes encode proteins that are aberrant tyrosine kinases capable of causing cell transformation. Alternatively, the overexpression of a normal proto-oncogenic tyrosine kinase may also result in proliferative disorders, sometimes resulting in a malignant phenotype. <br>
Receptor tyrosine kinases are large enzymes that span the cell membrane and possess an extracellular binding domain for growth factors, a transmembrane domain, and an intracellular portion that functions as a kinase to phosphorylate a specific tyrosine residue in proteins and hence to influence cell proliferation. Tyrosine kinases may be classified as growth factor receptor (e.g. EGFR, PDGFR, FGFR and erbB2) or non-receptor (e.g. c-src and bcr-abl) kinases. Such kinases may be aberrantly expressed in common human cancers such as breast cancer, gastrointestinal cancers such as colon, rectal or stomach cancer, leukemia, and ovarian, bronchial or pancreatic cancer. Aberrant erbB2 activity has been implicated in breast, ovarian, non-small cell lung, pancreatic, gastric and colon cancers. Studies indicate that epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is mutated or overexpressed in many human cancers such as brain, lung, squamous cell, bladder, gastric, breast, head and neck, oesophageal, gynecological and thyroid cancers. Thus, inhibitors of receptor tyrosine kinases may be useful as selective inhibitors of the growth of mammalian cancer cells.<br>
EGFR inhibitors may be useful in the treatment of pancreatitis and kidney disease (such as proliferate glomerulonephritis and diabetes-induced renal disease), and may reduce successful blastocyte implantation and therefore may be useful as a contraceptive. See PCT international application publication number WO 95/19970 (published July 27, 1995), hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.<br>
Polypeptide growth factors, such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) having a high affinity to the human kinase insert-domain-containing receptor (KDR) or the murine fetal liver kinase 1 (FLK-1) receptor have been associated with the proliferation of endothelial cells and more particularly vasculogenesis and angiogenesis. See PCT international application publication number WO 95/21613 (published August 17,1995), hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. Agents that are capable of binding to or modulating the KDR/FLK-1 receptor may be used to treat disorders related to vasculogenesis or angiogenesis, such as diabetes, diabetic retinopathy, age related macular degeneration, hemangioma, glioma, melanoma, Kaposi's sarcoma and ovarian, breast, lung, pancreatic, prostate, colon and epidermoid cancer.<br>

If the substituents themselves are not compatible with the synthetic methods of this invention, the substituent may be protected with a suitable protecting group that is stable to the reaction conditions used in these methods. The protecting group may be removed at a suitable point in the reaction sequence of the method to provide a desired intermediate or target compound. Suitable protecting groups and the methods for protecting and de-protecting differentsiibstituents using such suitable protecting groups are well known to those skilled in the art; examples of which may be found in T. Greene and P. Wuts, Protecting Groups in Chemical Synthesis (3rd ed.), John Wiley &amp; Sons, NY (1999), which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. In some instances, a substituent may be specifically selected to be reactive under the reaction conditions used in the methods of this invention. Under these circumstances, the reaction conditions convert the selected substituent into another substituent that is either useful in an intermediate compound in the methods of this invention or is a desired substituent in a target compound.<br>
The compounds of the present invention may have asymmetric carbon atoms. Such diastereomeric mixtures can be separated into their individual diastereomers on the basis of their physical chemical differences by methods known to those skilled in the art, for example, by chromatography or fractional crystallization. Enantiomers can be separated by converting the enantiomeric mixtures into a diastereomric mixture by reaction with an appropriate optically active compound (e.g., alcohol), separating the diastereomers and converting (e.g., hydrolyzing) the individual diastereomers to the corresponding pure enantiomers. All such isomers, including diastereomer mixtures and pure enantiomers are considered as part of the invention.<br>
The compounds of present invention may in certain instances exist as tautomers. This invention relates to the use of all such tautomers and mixtures thereof.<br>
Preferably, the compounds of the present invention are used in a form that is at least 90% optically pure, that is, a form that contains at least 90% of a single isomer (80% enantiomeric excess ("e.e.") or diastereomeric excess ("d.e.")), more preferably at least 95% (90% e.e. or d.e.), even more preferably at least 97.5% (95% e.e. or d.e.), and most preferably at least 99% (98% e.e. or d.e.).<br>

Illustrative examples of suitable salts include organic salts derived from amino acids, such as glycine and arginine, ammonia, carbonates, bicarbonates, primary, secondary, and tertiary amines, and cyclic amines, such as benzylamines, pyrrolidines, piperidine, morpholine and piperazine, and inorganic salts derived from sodium, calcium, potassium, magnesium, manganese, iron, copper, zinc, aluminum and lithium.<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions according to the invention may, alternatively or in addition to a compound of Formula (I), comprise as an active ingredient pharmaceutically acceptable salts of such compounds. Such compounds and salts are sometimes referred to herein collectively as "active agents" or "agents."<br>
It will be appreciated that any solvate (e.g. hydrate) form of compounds of formula (I) can be used for the purpose of the present invention.Therapeutically effective amounts of the active agents of the invention may be used to treat diseases mediated by modulation or regulation of protein kinases. An "effective amount" is intended to mean that amount of an agent that significantly inhibits proliferation and/or prevents de-differentiation of a eukaryotic cell, e.g., a mammalian, insect, plant or fungal cell, and is effective for the indicated utility, e.g., specific therapeutic treatment.<br>
The compositions, containing the compound(s) of the described herein can be administered for prophylactic and/or therapeutic treatments. In therapeutic applications, the compositions are administered to a patient already suffering from a proliferate disorder or condition (including, but not limited to, cancer), as described above, in an amount sufficient to cure or at least partially arrest the symptoms of the proliferative disorder or condition. An amount adequate to accomplish this is defined as "therapeutically effective amount or dose." Amounts effective for this use will depend on the severity and course of the proliferative disorder or condition, previous therapy, the patient's health status and response to the drugs, and the judgment of the treating physician. In prophylactic applications, compositions containing the compounds described herein are administered to a patient susceptible to or otherwise at risk of a particular proliferative disorder or condition. Such an amount is defined to be a "prophylactically effective amount or dose." In this use, the precise amounts also depend on the patient's state of health, weight, and the like. It is considered well within the skill of the art for one to determine such therapeutically effective or prophylactically effective amounts by routine experimentation (e.g., a dose escalation clinical trial).<br>
The terms "enhance" or "enhancing" means to increase or prolong either in potency or duration a desired effect. Thus, in regard to enhancing the effect of therapeutic agents, the term "enhancing" refers to the ability to increase or prolong, either in potency or duration, the effect of other therapeutic agents on a system (e.g., a tumor cell). An "enhancing-effective amount," as used herein, refers to an amount adequate to enhance the effect of another therapeutic agent in a desired system (including, by way of example only, a tumor cell in a patient).  When used in a patient, amounts effective for this use will depend on the severity and course of the proliferative disorder (including, but not limited to, cancer), previous therapy, the patient's health status and response to the drugs, and the judgment of the treating physician. It is considered well within the skill of the art for one to determine such enhancing-effective amounts by routine experimentation. Once improvement of the patient's conditions has occurred, a maintenance dose is administered if necessary. Subsequently, the dosage or the frequency of administration, or both, can be reduced, as a function of the symptoms, to a level at which the improved proliferative disorder or condition is retained. When the symptoms have been alleviated to the desired level,treatment can cease. Patients can, however, require intermittent treatment on a long-term basis upon any recurrence of the disease symptoms.<br>
The amount of a given agent that will correspond to such an amount will vary depending upon factors such as the particular compound, disease condition and its severity, the identity (e.g., weight) of the subject or host in need of treatment, but can nevertheless be routinely determined in a manner known in the art according to the particular circumstances surrounding the case, including, e.g., the specific agent being administered, the route of administration, the condition being treated, and the subject or host being treated. "Treating" is intended to mean at least the mitigation of a disease condition in a subject such as mammal (e.g., human), that is affected, at least in part, by the activity of one or more kinases, for example protein kinases such as tyrosine kinases, and includes: preventing the disease condition from occurring in a mammal, particularly when the mammal is found to be predisposed to having the disease condition but has not yet been diagnosed as having it; modulating and/or inhibiting the disease condition; and/or alleviating the disease condition.<br>
Agents that potently regulate, modulate, or inhibit cell proliferation are preferred. For certain mechanisms, inhibition of the protein kinase activity associated with CDK complexes, among others, and those which inhibit angiogenesis and/or inflammation are preferred. The present invention is further directed to methods of modulating or inhibiting protein kinase activity, for example in mammalian tissue, by administering a compound of Formula (I). The activity of agents as anti-proliferatives is easily measured by known methods, for example by using whole cell cultures in an MTT assay. The activity of the compounds of Formula (I) as modulators of protein kinase activity, such as the activity of kinases, may be measured by any of the methods available to those skilled in the art, including in vivo and/or in vitro assays. Examples of suitable assays for activity measurements include those described in International Publication No. WO 99/21845; Parast, et al., Biochemistry, 37, 16788-16801 (1998); Connell-Crowley and Harpes, Cell Cycle: Materials and Methods. (Michele Pagano, ed. Springer, Berlin, Germany)(1995); International Publication No. WO 97/34876; and International Publication No. WO 96/14843. These properties may be assessed, for example, by using one or more of the biological testing procedures set out in the examples below.<br>
The active agents of the invention may be formulated into pharmaceutical compositions as described below. Pharmaceutical compositions of this invention comprise an effective modulating, regulating, or inhibiting amount of a compound of Formula I and an inert, pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent. In one embodiment of the pharmaceutical compositions, efficacious levels of the compounds of Formula (I) are provided so as to providetherapeutic benefits involving anti-proliferative ability. By "efficacious levels" is meant levels in which proliferation is inhibited, or controlled. These compositions are prepared in unit-dosage form appropriate for the mode of administration, e.g., parenteral or oral administration.<br>
A compound of Formula (I) can be administered in conventional dosage form prepared by combining a therapeutically effective amount of an agent (e.g., a compound of Formula I) as an active ingredient with appropriate pharmaceutical carriers or diluents according to conventional procedures. These procedures may involve mixing, granulating and compressing or dissolving the ingredients as appropriate to the desired preparation.<br>
The pharmaceutical carrier employed may be either a solid or liquid. Exemplary of solid carriers are lactose, sucrose, talc, gelatin, agar, pectin, acacia, magnesium stearate, stearic acid and the like. Exemplary of liquid carriers are syrup, peanut oil, olive oil, water and the like. Similarly, the carrier or diluent may include time-delay or time-release material known in the art, such as glyceryl monostearate or glyceryl distearate alone or with a wax, ethylcellulose, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, methylmethacrylate and the like.<br>
A variety of pharmaceutical forms can be employed. Thus, if a solid carrier is used, the preparation can be tableted, placed in a hard gelatin capsule in powder or pellet form or in the form of a troche or lozenge. The amount of solid carrier may vary, but generally will be from about 25 mg to about 1 g. If a liquid carrier is used, the preparation will be in the form of syrup, emulsion, soft gelatin capsule, sterile injectable solution or suspension in an ampoule or vial or non-aqueous liquid suspension.<br>
To obtain a stable water-soluble dose form, a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of a compound of Formula (I) can be dissolved in an aqueous solution of an organic or inorganic acid,<br>
such as 0.3M solution of succinic acid or citric acid. If a soluble salt form is not available, the<br>
i<br>
agent may be dissolved in a suitable cosolvent or combinations of cosolvents. Examples of suitable cosolvents include, but are not limited to, alcohol, propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol 300, polysorbate 80, glycerin and the like in concentrations ranging from 0-60% of the total volume. In an exemplary embodiment, a compound of Formula I is dissolved in DMSO and diluted with water. The composition may also be in the form of a solution of a salt form of the active ingredient in an appropriate aqueous vehicle such as water or isotonic saline or dextrose solution.<br>
It will be appreciated that the actual dosages of the agents used in the compositions of this invention will vary according to the particular complex being used, the particular composition formulated, the mode of administration and the particular site, host and disease being treated. Optimal dosages for a given set of conditions can be ascertained by those skilled in theart using conventional dosage-determination tests-in view of the experimental data for an agent. For oral administration, an exemplary daily dose generally employed is from about 0.001 to about 1000 mg/kg of body weight, with courses of treatment repeated at appropriate intervals.<br>
The compositions of the invention may be manufactured in manners generally known for preparing pharmaceutical compositions, e.g., using conventional techniques such as mixing, dissolving, granulating, dragee-making, levigating, emulsifying, encapsulating, entrapping or lyophilizing. Pharmaceutical compositions may be formulated in a conventional manner using one or more physiologically acceptable carriers, which may be selected from excipients and auxiliaries that facilitate processing of the active compounds into preparations that can be used pharrnaceutically.<br>
Proper formulation is dependent upon the route of administration chosen. For injection, the agents of the -invention may be formulated into aqueous solutions, preferably in physiologically compatible buffers such as Hanks's solution, Ringer's solution, or physiological saline buffer. For transmucosal administration, penetrants appropriate to the barrier to be permeated are used in the formulation. Such penetrants are generally known in the art.<br>
For oral administration, the compounds can be formulated readily by combining the compounds with pharrnaceutically acceptable carriers known in the art. Such carriers enable the compounds of the invention to be formulated as tablets, pills, dragees, capsules, liquids, gels, syrups, slurries, suspensions and the like, for oral ingestion by a patient to be treated. Pharmaceutical preparations for oral use can be obtained using a solid excipient in admixture with the active ingredient (agent), optionally grinding the resulting mixture, and processing the mixture of granules after adding suitable auxiliaries, if desired, to obtain tablets or dragee cores. Suitable excipients include: fillers such as sugars, including lactose, sucrose, mannitol, or sorbitol; and cellulose preparations, for example, maize starch, wheat starch, rice starch, potato starch, gelatin, gum, methyl cellulose, hydroxypropylmethyl-cellulose, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, or polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP). If desired, disintegrating agents may be added, such as crosslinked polyvinylpyrrolidone, agar, or alginic acid or a salt thereof such as sodium alginate.<br>
Dragee cores are provided with suitable coatings. For this purpose, concentrated sugar solutions may be used, which may optionally contain gum arable, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, Carbopol gel, polyethylene glycol, and/or titanium dioxide, lacquer solutions, and suitable organic solvents or solvent mixtures. Dyestuffs or pigments may be added to the tablets or dragee coatings for identification or to characterize different combinations of agents.Pharmaceutical preparations that can be used orally include push-fit capsules made of gelatin, as well as soft, sealed capsules made of gelatin and a plasticizer, such as glycerol or sorbitol. The push-fit capsules can contain the agents in admixture with fillers such as lactose, binders such as starches, and/or lubricants such as talc or magnesium stearate, and, optionally, stabilizers. In soft capsules, the agents may be dissolved or suspended in suitable liquids, such as fatty oils, liquid paraffin, or liquid polyethylene glycols. In addition, stabilizers may be added. All formulations for oral administration should be in dosages suitable for such administration. For buccal administration, the compositions take the form of tablets or lozenges formulated in conventional manners.<br>
For administration intranasally or by inhalation, the compounds for use according to the present invention are conveniently delivered in the form of an aerosol spray presentation from pressurized packs or a nebuliser, with the . use of a suitable propellant, e.g., dichlorodifluoromethane, trichlorofluoromethane, dichlorotetrafluoroethane, carbon dioxide or other suitable gas. In the case of a pressurized aerosol the dosage unit may be determined by providing a valve to deliver a metered amount. Capsules and cartridges of gelatin for use in an inhaler or insufflator and the like may be formulated containing a powder mix of the compound and a suitable powder base such as lactose or starch.<br>
The compounds may be formulated for parenteral administration by injection, e.g., by bolus injection or continuous infusion. Formulations for injection may be presented in unit-dosage form, e.g., in ampoules or in multi-dose containers, with an added preservative. The compositions may take such forms as suspensions, solutions or emulsions in oily or aqueous vehicles, and may contain formulatory agents such as suspending, stabilizing and/or dispersing agents.<br>
Pharmaceutical formulations for parenteral administration include aqueous solutions of the agents in water-soluble form. Additionally, suspensions of the agents may be prepared as appropriate oily injection suspensions. Suitable lipophilic solvents or vehicles include fatty oils such as sesame oil, or synthetic fatty acid esters, such as ethyl oleate or triglycerides, or liposomes. Aqueous injection suspensions may contain substances that increase the viscosity of the suspension, such as sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, sorbitol, or dextran. Optionally, the suspension may also contain suitable stabilizers or agents that increase the solubility of the compounds to allow for the preparation of highly concentrated solutions.<br>
For administration to the eye, the agent is delivered in a pharmaceutically acceptable ophthalmic vehicle such that the compound is maintained in contact with the ocular surface for a sufficient time period to allow the compound to penetrate the corneal and internal regions of theye, for example, the anterior chamber, posterior chamber, vitreous body, aqueous humor, vitreous humor, cornea, iris/ciliary, lens, choroid/retina and sclera. The pharmaceutically acceptable ophthalmic vehicle may be an ointment, vegetable oil, or an encapsulating material. A compound of the invention may also be injected directly into the vitreous and aqueous humor. The agents may also be administered in conjunction with other accepted ophthalmic disease treatments, such as photodynamic therapy (PUT).<br>
Alternatively, the agents may be in powder form for constitution with a suitable vehicle, e.g., sterile pyrogen-free water, before use. The compounds may also be formulated in rectal compositions such as suppositories or retention enemas, e.g, containing conventional suppository bases such as cocoa butter or other glycerides.<br>
In addition to the formulations described above, the agents may also be formulated as a depot preparation. Such long-acting formulations may be administered by implantation (for example, subcutaneously or intramuscularly) or by intramuscular injection. Thus, for example, the compounds may be formulated with suitable polymeric or hydrophobic materials (for example, as an emulsion in an acceptable oil) or ion-exchange resins, or as sparingly soluble derivatives, for example, as a sparingly soluble salt.<br>
An exemplary pharmaceutical carrier for hydrophobic compounds is a cosolvent system comprising benzyl alcohol, a nonpolar surfactant, a water-miscible organic polymer, and an aqueous phase. The cosolvent system may be a VPD co-solvent system. VPD is a solution of 3% w/v benzyl alcohol, 8% w/v of the nonpolar surfactant polysorbate 80, and 65% w/v polyethylene glycol 300, made up to volume in absolute ethanol. The VPD co-solvent system (VPD:5W) contains VPD diluted 1:1 with a 5% dextrose in water solution. This co-solvent system dissolves hydrophobic compounds well, and itself produces low toxicity upon systemic administration. Naturally, the proportions of a co-solvent system may be varied considerably without destroying its solubility and toxicity characteristics. Furthermore, the identity of the cosolvent components may be varied: for example, other low-toxicity nonpolar surfactants may be used instead of polysorbate 80; the fraction size of polyethylene glycol may be varied; other biocompatible polymers may replace polyethylene glycol, e.g. polyvinyl pyrrolidone; and other sugars or polysaccharides may be substituted for dextrose.<br>
Alternatively, other delivery systems for hydrophobic pharmaceutical compounds may be employed. Liposomes and emulsions are known examples of delivery vehicles or carriers for hydrophobic drugs. Certain organic solvents such as dimethylsulfoxide also may be employed, although usually at the cost of greater toxicity. Additionally, the compounds may be delivered using a sustained-release system, such as semi-permeable matrices of solid hydrophobicpolymers containing the therapeutic agent. Various sustained-release materials have been established and are known by those skilled in the art. Sustained-release capsules may, depending on their chemical nature, release the compounds for a few weeks up to over 100 days. Depending on the chemical nature and the biological stability of the therapeutic reagent, additional strategies for protein stabilization may be employed.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions also may comprise suitable solid- or gel-phase carriers or excipients. Examples of such carriers or excipients include calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate, sugars, starches, cellulose derivatives, gelatin, and polymers such as polyethylene glycols.<br>
Some of the compounds of the invention may be provided as salts with pharmaceutically compatible counter ions. Pharmaceutically compatible salts may be formed with many acids, including hydrochloric, sulfuric, acetic, lactic, tartaric, malic, succinic, etc. Salts tend to be more soluble in aqueous or other protonic solvents than are the corresponding free-base forms.<br>
The agents of the invention may be useful in combination with known anti-cancer treatments such as: DNA interactive agents such as cisplatin or doxorubicin; topoisomerase II inhibitors such as etoposide; topoisomerase I inhibitors such as CPT-11 or topotecan; tubulin interacting agents such as paclitaxel, docetaxel or the epothilones; hormonal agents such as tamoxifen; thymidilate synthase inhibitors such as 5-fluorouracil; and anti-metalbolites such as methotrexate. They may be administered together or sequentially, and when administered sequentially, the agents may be administered either prior to or after administration of the known anticancer or cytotoxic agent.<br>
The term "chemotherapeutic agent" as used herein includes, for example, hormonal agents, antimetabolites, DMA interactive agents, tubilin-interactive agents, and others such as aspariginase or hydroxyureas.<br>
DNA-interactive agents include alkylating agents, such as cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, altretamine; DNA strand-breakage agents, such as bleomycin; intercalating topoisomerase II inhibitors, e.g., dactinomycin and doxorubicin); nonintercalating topoisomerase II inhibitors such as, etoposide and teniposide; and the DNA minor groove binder plicamydin, for example.<br>
Alkylating agents may form covalent chemical adducts with cellular DNA, RNA, or protein molecules, or with smaller amino acids, glutathione, or similar chemicals. Examples of typical alkylating agents include, but are not limited to, nitrogen mustards, such as chlorambucil, cyclophosphamide, isofamide, mechlorethamine, melphalan, uracil mustard; aziridine such as thiotepa; methanesulfonate esters such as busulfan; nitroso ureas, such as carmustine, lomustine, streptozocin; platinum complexes, such as cisplatin, carboplatin; bioreductive alkylator,such as mitomycfn, and procarbazine, dacarbazine and altretamine. DNA strgnd-breaking agents include bleomycin, for example.<br>
DNA topoisomerase II inhibitors may include intercalators such as the following: amsacrine, dactinomycin, daunorubicin, doxorubicin (adriamycin), idarubicin, and mitoxantrone; as well as nonintercalators such as etoposide and teniposide.<br>
An example of a DNA minor groove binder is plicamycin.<br>
Antimetabolites generally interfere with the production of nucleic acids and thereby growth of cells by one of two major mechanisms. Certain drugs inhibit production of deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates that are the precursors for DNA synthesis, thus inhibiting DNA replication. Examples of these compounds are analogues of purines or pyrimidines and are incorporated in anabolic nucleotide pathways. These analogues are then substituted into DNA or RNA instead of their normal counterparts.<br>
Antimetabolites useful as chemotherapeutic agents include, but are not limited to: folate antagonists such as methotrexate and trimetrexate; pyrimidine antagonists, such as fiuorouracil, fluorodeoxyuridine, CB3717, azacitidine, cytarabine, and floxuridine; purine antagonists such as mercaptopurine, 6-thioguanine, fludarabine, pentostatin; and ribonucleotide reductase inhibitors such as hydroxyurea.<br>
Tubulin interactive agents act by binding to specific sites on tubulin, a protein that polymerizes to form cellular microtubules. Microtubules are critical cell structure units and are required for cell division. These therapeutic agents disrupt the formation of microtubules. Exemplary tubulin-interactive agents include vincristine and vinblastine, both alkaloids and paclitaxel (Taxol).<br>
Hormonal agents are also useful in the treatment of cancers and tumors, but only rarely in the case of B cell malignancies. They are used in hormonally susceptible tumors and are usually derived from natural sources. Hormonal agents include, but are not limited to, estrogens, conjugated estrogens and ethinyl estradiol and diethylstilbesterol, chlortrianisen and idenestrol; progestins such as hydroxyprogesterone caproate, medroxyprogesterone, and megestrol; and androgens such as testosterone, testosterone propionate; fluoxymesterone, and methyltestosterone.<br>
Adrenal corticosteroids are derived from natural adrenal cortisol or hydrocortisone and are used to treat B cell malignancies. They are used because of their anti-inflammatory benefits as well as the ability of some to inhibit mitotic divisions and to halt DNA synthesis. These compounds include, but are not limited to, prednisone, dexamethasone, methylprednisolone, and prednisolone.Leutinizing hormone releasing hormone agents or gonadotropin-releasing hormone antagonists are used primarily the treatment of prostate cancer. These include leuprolide acetate and goserelin acetate. They prevent the biosynthesis of steroids in the testes.<br>
Antihormonal antigens include, for example, antiestrogenic agents such as tamoxifen, antiandrogen agents such as flutamide; and antiadrenal agents such as mitotane and aminoglutethimide.<br>
Other agents include hydroxyurea (which appears to act primarily through inhibition of the enzyme ribonucleotide reductase), and asparaginase (an enzyme which converts asparagine to aspartic acid and thus inhibits protein synthesis).<br>
Included within the scope of cancer therapy agents are radiolabeled antibodies, including but not limited to, Zevalin™ (IDEC Pharmaceuticals Corp.) and Bexxar™ (Corixa, Inc.); the use of any other radioisotope (e.g., 90Y and 131I) coupled to an antibody or antibody fragment that recognizes an antigen expressed by a neoplasm; external beam radiation or any other method for administration of radiation to a patient.<br>
Further included within the scope of cancer therapy agents are cytotoxins, including but not limited to an antibody or antibody fragment linked to a cytotoxin, or any other method for selectivly delivering a cytotoxic agent to a tumor cell.<br>
Further included within the scope of cancer therapy agents are selective methods for destroying DNA, or any method for delivering heat to a tumor cells, including by way of example only, nanoparticles.<br>
Further included within the scope of cancer therapy agents is the use of unlabeled antibodies or antibody fragments capable of killing or depleting tumor cells, including by way of example only, RituxanTM (IDEC Pharmaceuticals Corp.) and HerceptinTM (Genentech).<br>
The agents may be prepared using the reaction routes and synthesis schemes as described below, employing the general techniques known in the art using starting materials that are readily available. The preparation of preferred compounds of the present invention is described in detail in the following examples, but the artisan will recognize that the chemical reactions described may be readily adapted to prepare a number of other anti-proliferatives or protein kinase inhibitors of the invention. For example, the synthesis of non-exemplified compounds according to the invention may be successfully performed by modifications apparent to those skilled in the art, e.g., by appropriately protecting interfering groups, by changing to other suitable reagents known in the art, or by making routine modifications of reaction conditions. Alternatively, other reactions disclosed herein or generally known in the art will be recognized as having applicability for preparing other compounds of the invention.DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The compounds of Formula (I) can act as antagonists of the VEGFR2. Without being bound to any particular theory, the linked rings are thought to provide favorable space-filling and electrostatic complementarity in the active site of the targeted protein: the presence of a quinoline moiety offers structure advantages exemplified by the introduction of ether linked solubilizing groups on 6, or 7-position of the quinoline ring (depicted below):<br>
(Figure Removed)In addition, and without being bound to any particular theory, physico-chemical changes which result from introducing substituents at the 6 and 7 positions of the quinoline ring include but are not limited to: increased water solubility and selectivity (against FGF) of the prepared compounds and a favorable change in pharmaco-kinetics, dynamics and metabolism (PDM) properties<br>
In the examples described below, unless otherwise indicated, all temperatures are set forth in degrees Celsius and all parts and percentages are by weight. Reagents were purchased from commercial suppliers such as Aldrich Chemical Company or Lancaster Synthesis Ltd. and were used without further purification unless otherwise indicated. Tetrahydrofuran (THF), N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), dichloromethane, toluene, and dioxane were purchased from Aldrich in Sure seal bottles and used as received. All solvents were purified using standard methods readily known to those skilled in the art, unless otherwise indicated.<br>
The reactions set forth below were done generally under a positive pressure of argon or nitrogen or with a drying tube, at ambient temperature (unless otherwise stated), in anhydrous solvents, and the reaction flasks were fitted with rubber septa for the introduction of substrates and reagents via syringe. Glassware was oven dried and/or heat dried. Analytical thin layer chromatography (TLC) was performed on glass-backed silica gel 60 F 254 plates Analtech (0.25 mm) and eluted with the appropriate solvent ratios (v/v), and are denoted where appropriate. The reactions were assayed by TLC and terminated as judged by the consumption of starting material.<br>
Visualization of the TLC plates was done with a p-anisaldehyde spray reagent or phosphomolybdic acid reagent (Aldrich Chemical 20 wt % in ethanol) and activated with heat. Work-ups were typically done by doubling the reaction volume with the reaction solvent or extraction solvent and then washing with the indicated aqueous solutions using 25% by volume of the extraction volume unless otherwise indicated. Product solutions were dried over anhydrousNa2SO4 prior to filtration and evaporation of the solvents under reduced pressure on a rotary evaporator and noted as solvents removed in vacua. Flash column chromatography (Still et al., J. Org. Chem., 43, 2923 (1978)) was done using Baker grade flash silica gel (47-61 urn) and a silica gel: crude material ratio of about 20:1 to 50:1 unless otherwise stated. Hydrogenolysis was done at the pressure indicated in the examples or at ambient pressure.<br>
1H-NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker instrument operating at 300 MHz and 13C-NMR spectra were recorded operating at 75 MHz. NMR spectra were obtained as CDCI3 solutions (reported in ppm), using chloroform as the reference standard (7.25 ppm and 77.00 ppm) or CD3OD (3.4 and 4.8 ppm and 49.3 ppm), or internally tetramethylsilane (0.00 ppm) when appropriate. Other NMR solvents were used as needed. When peak multiplicities are reported, the following abbreviations are used: s (singlet), d (doublet), t (triplet), m (multiplet), br (broadened), dd (doublet of doublets), dt (doublet of triplets). Coupling constants, when given, are reported in Hertz (Hz).<br>
Infrared (IR) spectra were recorded on a Perkin-Elmer FT-IR Spectrometer as neat oils, as KBr pellets, or as CDCI3 solutions, and when given are reported in wave numbers (cm"1). The mass spectra were obtained using LSIMS or electrospray. All melting points (mp) are uncorrected.<br>
GENERAL   SYNTHETIC   SCHEMES   USED   FOR  THE   PREPARATION   OF   QUINOLINE ANALOGS SCHEME I: GENERAL PREPARATION OF 4-CHLOROQUINOLINE ANALOGS (I-F)(Figure Removed)In this scheme R is an R6 substituent as defined in connection with Formula (I).

A.	Preparation of Compound I-D<br>
A mixture of a substituted aniline l-A (1 eq.), and diethyl (ethoxymethylene) malonate I-B (1 eq.) was placed in a round bottom flask and heated in an oil bath. When the temperature of oil bath reached ~135°C EtOH was generated and collected with a condenser. The reaction was heated at 160°C for 40 minutes to give l-C. The reaction flask was removed from the oil bath. Phenyl ether (about two times volume of the reaction mixture) was added into the flask. The reaction flask was placed in the oil bath, which was preheated to 270°C. The reaction mixture was stirred and heated to 240-245°C (temperature of reactants inside the flask) for 15 minutes. The reaction flask was removed from heating and slowly poured into hexane. Compound I-D was collected by filtration and washed by hexane to remove phenyl ether. The yields of reactions starting from compound l-A to compound I-D were usually in the range of 60 to 90%.<br>
B.	Preparation of Compound I-E<br>
A solution of compound I-D (5 g) and KOH (3 eq.) in 60 ml of H2O/OH (CH2)2OH (1:1) was placed in a sealed vessel (XP-500 Plus vessel). The reaction was heated by microwave(MARS 5 Microwave System) at 200°C, under 220-240 psi pressure for 30 minutes. The reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature and poured into H2O (100 ml).   The solution was acidified with 2N HCI to pH~6, saturated with NaCI and extracted with THF (3 X 200 ml).  The combined oil layer was washed with brine and concentrated to give compound I-E (&gt;80% yield). C.         Preparation of Compound I-F<br>
Compound I-E was dissolved in neat POCI3 (excess). The solution was heated to reflux for 2 hours. The excess amount of POCI3 was removed by evaporation under vacuum. The residue was basified with NH4OH and extracted with EtOAc. The organic layer was concentrated. The residue was purified by column chromatography using 3:1 to 1:1 hexane/EtOAc to give compound I-F (70-90%).<br>
SCHEME  II:   GENERAL  PREPARATION  OF   (QUINOLIN-4-YL)OXY-1-BENZOFURAN   (OR BENZOTHIOPHENE, OR INDOLE) ANALOGS (II-C)(Figure Removed)A solution of 4-chloroqunoline II-A (1 eq.), 4-hydroxylbenzofuran (where X = O) II-B (1 eq.) and Cs2CO3 (1.5-2 eq.) in dry DMSO was heated to 120-130°C for 2 hours. The dark brown solution was extracted with EtOAc. The organic layer was washed with brine, dried (MgSO4) and concentrated.

below.<br><br><br><br>
7-(benzyloxy)-4-chloroquinoline 90-B was prepared (see general synthesis Scheme I) from the commercially available compound 90-A (from Aldrich). A mixture of 90-B (2.8 g, 10.4 mmol), 6-hydroxy-2-methyl-1-benzofuran-3-carboxylic acid 90-C (2 g, 10.4 mmol) and Cs2COa (10.1g, 31.4 mmol) in DMSO (70 ml) was heated to 130PC for 2 hours. The solution was poured into water, neutralized with AcOH and extracted with EtOAc. The concentrated residue was purified by silica gel chromatography using 2-5% MeOH in CH2CI2 to give 6-{[7-(benzyloxy)quinolin-4-yl]oxy}-2-methyl-1-benzofuran-3-carboxylic acid 90-D (4.2g, 94% yield) as a solid.<br>
Compound 90-D (2.4 g) was treated with TFA (net) by refluxing for 2 hours. The solution was cooled to room temperature, poured into water and extracted with EtOAc. The organic layer was washed (brine), dried (MgSO4) and concentrated to give 6-[(7-hydroxyquinolin-4-yl)oxy]-2-methyl-1-benzofuran-3-carboxylic acid 90-E (1.4 g, 86% yield).<br>
A solution of 90-E (1.6 g, 4.8 mmol), HATU (2.1 g, 5.7 mmol) and triethylamine (970 mg, 9.6 mmol) in DMF (10 ml) was stirred at room temperature for 20 minutes. To the solution was added cyclopropanamine 90-F (547 mg, 9.6 mmol). The reaction mixture was stirred for 30 minutes, poured into water and extracted with EtOAc. Silica gel column chromatography using 5% MeOH in CH2CI2 yield A/-cyc!opropyl-6-[(7-hydroxyquinolin-4-yl)oxy]-2-methyl-1-benzofuran-3-carboxamide 90-G (1.4 g, 77% yield) as a solid.<br>
A solution of 90-G (1.4 g, 3.7 mmol), Br(CH2)2Br 90-H (2.1 g, 11.2 mmol) and K2CO3 (1.5 g, 11.2 mmol) in DMF (40 ml) was heated to 50°C overnight. The reaction mixture was extracted with EtOAc. The concentrated residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography using<br><br>
5%   MeOH/CH2CI2  to  yield  6-{[7-(2-bromoethoxy)quinolin-4-yl]oxy}-A/-cycl6propyl-2-methyl-1-benzofuran-3-carboxamide 90-1 (1.1 g, 61%).<br>

The stimulation of cell proliferation by growth factors such as VEGF, FGF, and others is dependent upon their induction of autophosphorylation of each of their respective receptor's tyrosine kinases. Therefore, the ability of a protein kinase inhibitor to block cellular proliferation induced by these growth factors is directly correlated with its ability to block receptor autophosphorylation. To measure the protein kinase inhibition activity of the compounds, the following constructs were devised, (i) VEGF-R2 Construct for Assav:<br>
This construct determines the ability of a test compound to inhibit tyrosine kinase activity. A construct (VEGF-R2D50) of the cytosolic domain of human vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGF-R2) lacking the 50 central residues of the 68 residues of the kinase insert domain was expressed in a baculovirus/insect cell system. Of the 1356 residues of full-length VEGF-R2, VEGF-R2D50 contains residues 806-939 and 990-1171, and also one point mutation (E990V) within the kinase insert domain relative to wild-type VEGF-R2. Autophosphorylation of the purified construct was performed by incubation of the enzyme at a concentration of 4 mM in the presence of 3 mM ATP and 40 mM MgCI2 in 100 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, containing 5% glycerol and 5 mM DTT, at 4 °C for 2 h. After autophosphorylation, this construct has been shown to possess catalytic activity essentially equivalent to the wild-type autophosphorylated kinase domain construct. See Parastetal., Biochemistry, 37, 16788-16801 (1998). (jj) FGF-R1 Construct for Assav:<br>
The intracellular kinase domain of human FGF-R1 was expressed using the baculovirus vector expression system starting from the endogenous methionine residue 456 to glutamate 766, according to the residue numbering system of Mohammadi et al., Mol. Cell. Biol., 16, 977-989 (1996). In addition, the construct also has the following 3 amino acid substitutions:  L457V, C488A, and C584S. Example A VEGF-R2 Assav: Coupled Spectrophotometric (FLVK-P) Assav<br>
The production of ADP from ATP that accompanies phosphoryl transfer was coupled to oxidation of NADH using phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) and a system having pyruvate kinase (PK) and lactic dehydrogenase (LDH). The oxidation of NADH was monitored by following the decrease of absorbance at 340 nm (8340 = 6.22 cm-1 mM-1) using a Beckman DU 650 spectrophotometer. Assay conditions for phosphorylated VEGF-R2D50 (indicated as FLVK-P in the tables below) were the following: 1 mM PEP; 250 mM NADH; 50 units of LDH/mL; 20 units ofPK/mL; 5 mM DTT; 5.1 mM poly(E4Y1); 1 mM ATP; and 25 mM MgCI2 in 200 mM HEPES, pH 7.5. Assay conditions for unphosphorylated VEGF-R2D50 (indicated as FLVK in the tables) were the following: 1 mM PEP; 250 mM NADH; 50 units of LDH/mL; 20 units of PK/mL; 5 mM DTT; 20 mM poly(E4Y1); 3 mM ATP; and 60 mM MgCI2 and 2 mM MnCI2 in 200 mM HEPES, pH 7.5. Assays were initiated with 5 to 40 nM of enzyme. K, values were determined by measuring enzyme activity in the presence of varying concentrations of test compounds. The percent inhibition at 50 nM (% inhibition @ 50 nM) was determined by linear least-squares regression analysis of absorbance as a function of time. The binding inhibitions were fitted to equation as described by Morrison. The data were analyzed using Enzyme Kinetic and Kaleidagraph software. Example B FGF-R Assay<br>
The spectrophotometric assay was carried out as described above for VEGF-R2, except for the following changes in concentration: FGF-R = 50 nM, ATP = 2 mM, and poly(E4Y1) = 15 mM.<br>
Example C HUVEC + VEGF Proliferation Assay<br>
This assay determines the ability of a test compound to inhibit the growth factor-stimulated proliferation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells ("HUVEC"). HUVEC cells (passage 3-4, Clonetics, Corp.) were thawed into EGM2 culture medium (Clonetics Corp) in T75 flasks. Fresh EGM2 medium was added to the flasks 24 hours later. Four or five days later, cells were exposed to another culture medium (F12K medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 60 mg/mL endothelial cell growth supplement (EGGS), and 0.1 mg/mL heparin). Exponentially-growing HUVEC cells were used in experiments thereafter. Ten to twelve thousand HUVEC cells were plated in 96-well dishes in 100 ml of rich, culture medium (described above). The cells were allowed to attach for 24 hours in this medium. The medium was then removed by aspiration and 105 ml of starvation media (F12K+1% FBS) was added to each well. After 24 hours, 15 ml of test agent dissolved in 1 % DMSO in starvation medium or this vehicle alone was added into each treatment well; the final DMSO concentration was 0.1%. One hour later, 30 ml of VEGF (30 ng/mL) in starvation media was added to all wells except those containing untreated controls; the final VEGF concentration was 6 ng/mL. Cellular proliferation was quantified 72 hours later by MTT dye reduction, at which time cells were exposed for 4 hours MTT (Promega Corp.). Dye reduction was stopped by addition of a stop solution (Promega Corp.) and absorbance at 595 nm was determined on a 96-well spectrophotometer plate reader.ExampleJD Mouse PK Assay<br>
The pharmacokinetics (e.g., absorption and elimination) of drugs in mice were analyzed using the following experiment. Test compounds were formulated as a suspension in a 30:70 (PEG   400:   acidified   H20)  vehicle.    This  solution  was  administered   orally  (p.o.)   and intraperitoneally (i.p.) at 50 mg/kg to two distinct groups (n=4) of B6 female mice. Blood samples were collected via an orbital bleed at time points: 0 hour (pre-dose), 0.5 hr, 1.0 hr, 2.0 hr, and 4.0 hr post dose.   Plasma was obtained from each sample by centrifugation at 2500 rpm for 5 min.   Test compound was extracted from the plasma by an organic protein precipitation method.   For each time bleed, 50 μL of plasma was combined with 1.0 mL of acetonitrile, vortexed for 2 min. and then spun at 4000 rpm for 15 min. to precipitate the protein and extract out the test compound. Next, the acetonitrile supernatant (the extract containing test compound) was poured into new test tubes and evaporated on a hot plate (25°C) under a steam of N2 gas. To each tube containing the dried test compound extract, 125 uL of mobile phase (60:40, 0.025  M  NH4H2P04 + 2.5 mL/L TEA:acetonitrile) was added.   The test compound  was resuspended in the mobile phase by vortexing and more protein was removed by centrifugation at 4000 rpm for 5 min. Each sample was poured into an HPLC vial for test compound analysis on an Hewlett Packard 1100 series HPLC with UV detection. From each sample, 95 uL was injected onto a Phenomenex-Prodigy reverse phase C-18, 150 x 3.2 mm column and eluted with a 45-50% acetonitrile gradient run over 10 min. Test-compound plasma concentrations (ug/mL) were determined by a comparison to standard curve (peak area vs. cone. ug/mL) using known concentrations of test compound extracted from plasma samples in the manner described above.  Along with the standards and unknowns, three groups (n=4) of quality controls (0.25 ug/mL, 1.5 ug/mL, and 7.5 ug/mL) were run to insure the consistency of the analysis.  The standard curve had an R2 &gt; 0.99 and the quality controls were all within 10% of their expected values. The quantitated test samples were plotted for visual display using Kalidagraph software and their pharmacokinetic parameters were determined using WIN NONLIN software. Example E Human Liver Microsome (HLMl Assay<br>
Compound metabolism in human liver microsomes was measured by LC-MS analytical assay procedures as follows. First, human liver microsomes (HLM) were thawed and diluted to 5 mg/mL with cold 100 mM potassium phosphate (KP04) buffer. Appropriate amounts of KPO4 buffer, NADPH-regenerating solution (containing B-NADP, glucose-6-phosphate, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, and MgCI2), and HLM were preincubated in 13 x 100 mm glass tubesat 37°C for 10 min. (3 tubes per test compound-triplicate). Test compound (5 μM final) was added to each tube to initiate reaction and was mixed by gentle vortexing, followed by incubation at 37°C. At t=0, and 2 h, a 250-uL sample was removed from each incubation tube to separate 12 x 75 mm glass tubes containing 1 mL ice-cold acetonitrile with 0.05 uM reserpine. Samples were centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 20 min. to precipitate proteins and salt (Beckman Allegra 6KR, S/N ALK98D06, #634). Supernatant was transferred to new 12 x 75 mm glass tubes and evaporated by Speed-Vac centrifugal vacuum evaporator. Samples were reconstituted in 200 uL 0.1% formic acid/acetonitrile (90/10) and vortexed vigorously to dissolve. The samples were then transferred to separate polypropylene microcentrifuge tubes and centrifuged at 14000x g for 10 min. (Fisher Micro 14, S/N M0017580). For each replicate (#1-3) at each timepoint (0 and 2 h), an aliquot sample of each test compound was combined into a single HPLC vial insert (6 total samples) for LC-MS analysis, which is described below.<br>
The combined compound samples were injected into the LC-MS system, composed of a Hewlett-Packard HP1100 diode array HPLC and a Micromass Quattro II triple quadruple mass spectrometer operating in positive electrospray SIR mode (programmed to scan specifically for the molecular ion of each test compound). Each test compound peak was integrated at each timepoint For each compound, peak area at each timepoint (n=3) was averaged, and this mean peak area at 2 h was divided by the average peak area at time 0 hour to obtain the percent test compound remaining at 2 h. Example F KDR (VEGFR21 phosphorvlation in PAE-KDR cells assay<br>
This assay determines the ability of a test compound to inhibit the autophosphorylation of KDR in porcine aorta endothelial (PAE)-KDR cells. PAE cells that overexpress human KDR were used in this assay. The cells were cultured in Ham's F12 media supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 400ug/mL G418. Thirty thousands cells were seeded into each well of a 96-well plate in 75 mL of growth media and allowed to attach for 6 hours at 37°C. Cells were then exposed to the starvation media (Ham's F12 media supplemented with 0.1% FBS) for 16 hours. After the starvation period was over, 10 mL of test agent in 5% DMSO in starvation media were added to the test wells and 10 mL of the vehicle (5% DMSO in starvation media) were added into the control wells. The final DMSO concentration in each well was 0.5%. Plates were incubated at 37°C for 1 hour and the cells were then stimulated with 500 ng/ml VEGF (commercially available from R &amp; D System) in the presence of 2mM Na3VO4 for 8 minutes. The cells were washed once with 1 mm Na3VO4 in HBSS and lysed by adding 50 mL per well of lysis buffer. One hundred mL of dilution buffer were then added to each well and the diluted cell lysatewas transferred to a 96-well goat ant-rabbit coated plate (commercially available from Pierce) which was pre-coated with Rabbit anti Human Anti-flk-1 C-20 antibody (commercially available from Santa Cruz). The plates were incubated at room temperature for 2 hours and washed seven times with 1% Tween 20 in PBS. HRP-PY20 (commercially available from Santa Cruz) was diluted and added to the plate for a 30-minute incubation. Plates were then washed again and TMB peroxidase substrate (commercially available from Kirkegaard &amp; Perry) was added for a 10-minute incubation. One hundred mL of 0.09 N H2SO4 was added to each well of the 96-well plates to stop the reaction. Phosphorylation status was assessed by spectrophotometer reading at 450 nm. IC50 values were calculated by curve fitting using a four-parameter analysis. Example G PAE-PDGFRb phosphorvlation in PAE-PDGFRB cells assay<br>
This assay determines the ability of a test compound to inhibit the autophosphorylation of PDGFRb in porcine aorta endothelial (PAE)- PDGFRb cells. PAE cells that overexpress human PDGFRb were used in this assay. The ceils were cultured in Ham's F12 media supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 400ug/ml G418. Twenty thousands cells were seeded in each well of a 96-well plate in 50 ml of growth media and allowed to attach for 6 hours at 37°C. Cells were then exposed to the starvation media (Ham's F12 media supplemented with 0.1% FBS) for 16 hours. After the starvation period was over, 10 mL of test agent in 5% DMSO in starvation media were added to the test wells and 10 mL of the vehicle (5% DMSO in starvation media) were added into the control wells. The final DMSO concentration in each well was 0.5%. Plates were incubated at 37°C for 1 hour and the cells were then stimulated with 1mg/mL PDGF-BB (R &amp; D System) in the presence of 2mM Na3VO4 for 8 minutes. The cells were washed once with 1 mm Na3VO4 in HBSS and lysed by adding 50 mL per well of lysis buffer. One hundred mL of dilution buffer were then added to each well and the diluted cell lysate was transferred to a 96-well goat ant-rabbit coated plate (Pierce), which was pre-coated with Rabbit anti Human PDGFRb antibody (Santa Cruz). The plates were incubated at room temperature for 2 hours and washed seven times with 1% Tween 20 in PBS. HRP-PY20 (Santa Cruz) was diluted and added to the plate for a 30-minute incubation. Plates were then washed again and TMB peroxidase substrate (Kirkegaard &amp; Perry) was added for a 10-minute incubation. One hundred mL of 0.09 N H2S04 was added into each well of the 96-well plate to stop the reaction. Phosphorylation status was assessed by spectrophotometer reading at 450 nm. IC50 values were calculated by curve fitting using a four-parameter analysis.<br>
The results of the testing of the compounds using various assays are summarized in (Table Removed)EXAMPLES OF PHARMACEUTICAL FORMULATIONS<br>
The pharmaceutical composition may, for example, be in a form suitable for oral administration as a tablet, capsule, pill, powder, sustained release formulations, solution, suspension, for parenteral injection as a sterile solution, suspension or emulsion, for topical administration as an ointment or cream or for rectal administration as a suppository. The pharmaceutical composition may be in unit dosage forms suitable for single administration of precise dosages. The pharmaceutical composition will include a conventional pharmaceutical carrier or excipient and a compound according to the invention as an active ingredient. In addition, it may include other medicinal or pharmaceutical agents, carriers, adjuvants, etc. Exemplary parenteral administration forms include solutions or suspensions of active compounds in sterile aqueous solutions, for example, aqueous propylene glycol or dextrose solutions. Such dosage forms can be suitably buffered, if desired.<br>
Suitable pharmaceutical carriers include inert diluents or fillers, water and various organic solvents. The pharmaceutical compositions may, if desired, contain additional ingredients such as flavorings, binders, excipients and the like.
