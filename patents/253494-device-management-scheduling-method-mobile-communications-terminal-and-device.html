				<td>Description<br>
Technical Field<br>
[1] The present invention relates to device management and data synchronization<br>
techniques, and particularly, to a device management system and a device management<br>
command scheduling method thereof.<br>
Background Art<br>
[2] In general, Device Management (DM) techniques relate to performing specific<br>
processing commands by a client as soon as a particular processing command is received<br>
from a server.<br>
[3]	In such a DM technique, a DM server instructs a processing command to a DM<br>
client, and the DM client immediately performs the corresponding command. Afterwards,<br>
the DM client performs a report procedure regarding the results in performing those<br>
commands.<br>
[4] In addition, the DM server requests the DM client to vary, update, and delete a<br>
specific function. If the DM client is currently in a state that it cannot perform the request<br>
from the DM server, a DM session for checking the state (status) of the DM client should<br>
be periodically generated and/or inquired by the DM server, and the issues and problems<br>
related thereto should be considered. Therefore, in the related art DM method, procedures<br>
for allowing the DM server to performs commands of the DM server at a desired time<br>
point, status, and have not been proposed thus far.<br>
[5] Additionally, in the related art, because the DM client must immediately perform<br>
the DM command (sent by the DM server upon opening (starting) a DM session) during<br>
the DM session, such DM command cannot be performed outside (after) the DM session<br>
upon considering the internal state of the device or upon occurrence of various events, and<br>
cannot be performed at particular desired times or situations. These related art restrictions<br>
not only increased the costs involved in performing state diagnosis procedures for the<br>
device, but also, effective diagnosis and effective problem solving that could be achieved<br><br>
by appropriate measures upon detecting problems before they may occur were impossible<br>
to perform. Also, these related art restrictions always required new DM sessions for<br>
performing DM commands, and thus, undesirably high device management costs had to be<br>
tolerated.<br>
US 5,913,037 may be construed to disclose a method and a terminal according to the<br>
preambles of claims 1 and 13.<br>

and a device management scheduling method in which a server can establish a device<br>
management scheduling in a client and vary and delete the established device management<br>
scheduling.<br>
[8] Still another object of the present invention is to provide a device management<br>
system and a device management scheduling method in the system in which a server can<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
[40] Reference will now be made in detail to some preferred embodiments of the present<br>
invention, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings.<br>
[41] The present invention provides a device management system in which a server can<br>
dynamically manage a device management scheduling of a client for device management<br>
or data synchronization, and a device management scheduling method in the corresponding<br>
system.<br>
[42] In addition, the present invention provides a device management system in which a<br>
server schedules a device management or a device management command of a client, and<br>
accordingly the client spontaneously reports the status of a device (e.g., a terminal),<br><br>
performs scheduled programs (diagnostic programs, status logging programs, virus<br>
detecting programs, and the like), and uses optimal parameter values according to the<br>
change of a usage environment at or in a specific time point or status, and a device<br>
management scheduling method in the corresponding system.<br>
[43] For this, in the device management system and the device management scheduling<br>
method thereof, the server transmits a Device Management (DM) scheduling context<br>
including a DM command and a scheduling information to a client of a target device, and<br>
the client generates a DM tree (i.e., a type of information management hierarchy or<br>
structure with multiple levels or branches that resemble a "tree") using the DM scheduling<br>
context and thereafter performs the corresponding DM command according to a command<br>
performing condition (i.e., a condition for performing a command). Preferably, the target<br>
device refers to user equipment (UE) such as terminals, PDAs, notebook Personal<br>
Computers (PCs) and desktop PCs, and the like, of which explanation will be provided<br>
only for the terminals merely for the sake of convenience. Hereinafter, some preferred<br>
embodiments of the present invention will now be described in detail.<br>
[44] FIG. 1 is a block diagram showing a device management system according to the<br>
present invention.<br>
[45] As shown in FIG. 1, the device management system according to the present invention<br>
includes: a Device Management (DM) server 100 for generating a DM scheduling context<br>
and transmitting such to a device (e.g., a terminal); and a DM client 200 for generating a<br>
DM tree in the terminal using the scheduling context transmitted from the DM server 100<br>
and performing a corresponding DM command when a command performing condition<br>
(i.e., a condition for performing a command) is satisfied.<br>
[46] The DM client 200 includes: a command processing module 20 for receiving the<br>
scheduling context from the DM server 100; a scheduling module 30 for generating a DM<br>
tree 40 using the scheduling context transmitted from the command processing module 20,<br>
notifying the satisfaction of the command performing condition to the command<br>
processing module 20 in order to perform a corresponding DM command when the<br>
command performing condition is satisfied, and receiving a processing result of the DM<br><br>
command from the command processing module 20 to thereby selectively report it to the<br>
DM server.<br>
[47] The DM scheduling context includes the DM command and a schedule associated<br>
with the performance of the DM command, for instance, an information element Condition<br>
for the command performing condition, an information element Commands for the<br>
scheduled DM commands, an information element 'Userlntef for a user interface, an<br>
information element for a status report gating, and the like.<br>
[48] FIG. 1 shows an example for the DM tree generated by the DM client.<br>
[49] Referring to FIG. 1, the DM tree 40 includes at least one or more MD scheduling sub-<br>
trees 41, each of which includes a plurality of scheduling nodes, namely, a schedule node<br>
Schedl, a SchedID node, a Condition node, a Commands node, a Userlnter node, Gating<br>
node, and the like.<br>
[50] The schedule node Sche_l indicates each device management scheduling (Sched_l,..<br>
. ), and connects the Commands node and the Condition node to each other. Especially, the<br>
schedule node Sched_l is used as a "placeholder' (i.e., a position basis node). The<br>
Condition node indicates a condition that the DM command is to be performed. The<br>
Commands node indicates scheduled DM commands to be performed by the DM client<br>
when the command performing condition is satisfied (i.e., at a specific time point or<br>
status). Also, the Userlnter node indicates whether user confirmation should be received<br>
regarding the performing of the corresponding command when the command performing<br>
condition is satisfied. The Gating node indicates whether to notify the performance result<br>
of the DM command to the DM server 100. In addition, the DM scheduling sub-tree 41<br>
may further selectively (optionally) include a DM server Mgmtsvr node. Preferably, the<br>
Mgmtsvr node stores a server address to report the performance result of the DM<br>
command. For instance, if the processing result is to be reported to another server other<br>
than the corresponding DM server, or the DM server to which the processing result is to be<br>
reported is varied according to each processing result, the Mgmtsvr node includes ACL<br>
(Access Control List) information indicating a server having a management authority for<br>
each node.<br><br>
[51] The DM tree 40 denotes a logical data structure in which the DM server can remotely<br>
manage information stored in a common database 50 within the device by a DM session<br>
and DM protocols which are the same with respect to all different types of devices. The<br>
DM tree 40 provides names for each information stored in the common database 50 and<br>
provides a path for accessing each information. The DM tree 40 includes properties such as<br>
the logical and physical formats of the information, or the like.<br>
[52] The common database 50 in which various information that the DM server 100 can<br>
manage is stored, is used to store an actual value of each node within the DM scheduling<br>
sub-tree 41. In particular, the Commands node and the Condition node correspond to one<br>
command XML (extensible Markup Language) document and a scheduling XML<br>
document, respectively.<br>
[53] The command XML document includes DM commands to be processed by the DM<br>
client at and/or in the time point and the status that the scheduling condition is satisfied.<br>
Each command language is composed of commands defined by the DM protocols.<br>
[54] FIG. 2 shows a construction of the command XML document, and FIG. 3 shows a<br>
Document Type Definition (DTD) of the command XML document. As shown in FIGS. 2<br>
and 3, a root element of the command XML document refers to a Command element. A<br>
command language element defined in a corresponding DM protocol is included in<br>
contents of the Command element.<br>
[55] When the DM scheduling sub-tree 41 is constructed, the DM client 200 receives the<br>
DM commands from the DM server 100 and stores them in the common database 50.<br>
Thereafter, the DM commands can be varied or deleted in another DM session.<br>
[56] The scheduling XML document includes scheduling information which describes a<br>
condition in which the DM commands included in the command XML document are to be<br>
performed. FIG. 4 shows a construction of the scheduling information XML document, and<br>
FIG. 5 is a DTD of the scheduling information XML document.<br><br>
[57] Referring to FIGS. 4 and 5, the scheduling XML document is one valid XML<br>
document in which a <sched> element is the root element. Each information element<br>
describes the scheduling conditions. When the DM scheduling sub-tree 41 is constructed,<br>
the DM client 200 receives the scheduling information from the DM server 100 and stores<br>
it in the common database 50. Afterwards, the scheduling information can be varied or<br>
deleted in another DM session.<br>
[58] The scheduling Sched element, as the root element of a scheduling information XML<br>
document, is composed of one or several simple scheduling SimpSched elements. The<br>
Sched element defines a trigger. In general, the Sched element corresponds to the sum of<br>
triggers that the SimpSched elements define. The trigger informs the DM client that the<br>
time point or condition, at/in which the DM commands included in the command XML<br>
document are to be performed, is satisfied.<br>
[59] The SimpSched element defines one simple scheduling specification and one or<br>
several triggers. A definitive scheduling specification is defined by putting several simple<br>
scheduling specifications together. The definitive scheduling specification is defined by the<br>
Sched element. The SimpSched element is composed of unit scheduling specifications<br>
defined by one or more of duration Dur, period Per and threshold Th elements. An<br>
interrelation for assigning a condition, in which the trigger generated from each element is<br>
to be delivered to the DM client, is formed between the unit scheduling specifications. That<br>
is, if a logical value of a particular unit element is 'false', a trigger generated from another<br>
unit element can never be delivered to the DM client.<br>
[60] The Dur element is a unit scheduling specification for designating a time period or a<br>
specific time point. The time period defines both a logical value and a trigger at the same<br>
time, and the specific time point only defines a trigger.<br>
[61] FIG. 6 is an embodiment of the duration Dur element.<br>
[62] Referring to FIG. 6, a content of the duration element, as a clear-text based on a<br>
special syntax to be described below, configures a starting point and an end point of the<br><br>
time range by using a special operator ' . . . '. The duration element is represented with<br>
data and time. When both the data and time are used together, the data is positioned prior<br>
to the time and the data and time are divided by 'T'. For instance, Jul. 26, 2004, 23 hours<br>
59 minutes 59 seconds is expressed as "2004-07-26T23:59:59". In addition, a minimum<br>
unit of the duration element is limited to 10 seconds, and '*', "im", and '.about.', define<br>
'every hour', 'immediately', and 'continuously', respectively in sequence. At this time, the<br>
'.about.' may be used with the 'im'.<br>
[63] The period Per element, as a unit scheduling element for defining a time period, is<br>
used together with another unit scheduling element, and periodically generates sequential<br>
triggers while the condition is 'true'.<br>
[64] The Per element defines a period by a second unit, and refers to a numerical text<br>
represented by using an integer or a real number without any symbol. The Per element<br>
cannot be used independently in the SimpSched element. The trigger cannot be generated<br>
in the Per element while an associated condition is 'false', but be generated repeatedly<br>
when the condition is changed from 'false' into 'true' for the first time and while the<br>
condition maintains 'true' depending on the period defined by the Per element.<br>
[65] The threshold Th element, as a unit scheduling element for defining a value range, can<br>
define two different types of ranges and a specific value in which the trigger is generated.<br>
The Th element can be used together with other unit scheduling elements, such as another<br>
Th element, the Dur element, or the Per element. The Th element has an attribute value<br>
'Hyst', and indicates a hysteresis value for a specific threshold. The Th element also has an<br>
attribute value 'MgmtObj' and a URI (Uniform Resource Indicator) of a management<br>
object associated with the Th element. Contents of the threshold element are a plain text<br>
string composed on the basis of a specific syntax to be described below.<br>
[66] FIG. 7 is a view defining contents of a threshold (Th) element, which is described on<br>
the basis of an ABNF (Augmented Backus-Naur Form) defined by RFC2234.<br><br>
[67] As shown in FIG. 7, the contents of the Th element are a plain text string composed of<br>
management object values, special symbols, and operators. Priorities of the operators are<br>
the same as the order enumerated in FIG. 8.<br>
[68] The contents of the Th element are represented as "ThContent" composed of more<br>
than one "ThContentltem" which is divided by an "IS" operator. At this time, the<br>
"ThContentltem" defines one of "ThGroup", "ThRange", and "EventRange".<br>
[69] The ThGroup defines one or more triggers which are represented by a combination<br>
between "Threshold' and 'Delta' or a combination between "TW(*)" and "ThExc". The<br>
trigger, which is an indicator for informing a client that an associated command should be<br>
processed, can be generated from the Th element, the Dur element and the Per element. At<br>
this time, the trigger generated from a trigger element is related to a change of the<br>
associated management object value.<br>
[70] The "Threshold' defines a threshold defined as a certain value of the associated<br>
management object, and is used when defining a boundary value, a trigger, and delta of a<br>
threshold range.<br>
[71] The 'TW' which defines a special symbol referred to as a threshold wildcard<br>
represents all the management object values. At this time, the trigger is generated<br>
according to the change of the management object value, but the threshold wildcard does<br>
not define the condition.<br>
[72] The "ThExc" defines a threshold excluded from another threshold group, and is<br>
generally used together with the threshold wildcard.<br>
[73] The "Delta" is composed of one or more thresholds, each of which represents each<br>
delta. At this time, a boundary value of the event range is represented by event elements<br>
which indicate an event start and an event end. When the event start of the event range<br>
occurs, a logical value of the condition indicated by the "EventRange" element is "true".<br>
When the event end of the event range occurs, the logical value of the condition is "false".<br>
The "Event" denotes an event that a management object value has a specific value or falls<br><br>
within a certain range. Therefore, the threshold, the threshold group, and the threshold<br>
range may be used in order to represent the "Event'. For instance, an event in which the<br>
management object value has a specific value or falls within a range of a default value can<br>
be the "Event". One or both sides of the event range can be opened, and the range of which<br>
both sides are opened is referred to as an event range wildcard.<br>
[74] The "ThRange", which defines the threshold range, is used for defining a condition<br>
and for generating a trigger. A certain side of the threshold range can be opened. A special<br>
range of which both sides are opened is referred to as a threshold range wildcard. The<br>
threshold range wildcard cannot be used independently, but be useful when using it<br>
together with "ThRangeExc". A trigger is generated when a logical value of the condition<br>
defined by the threshold range is changed into "true" for the first time. Afterwards,<br>
whenever the logical value of the condition is changed, the trigger is also generated.<br>
[75] The "ThRangeExc" element is composed of more than one TREP so as to represent an<br>
exclusion from a specific threshold range. At this time, the TREP is a component only used<br>
in the "ThRangeExc".<br>
[76] The "EventRange" element, which indicates an event range, can define a condition and<br>
a trigger as the "ThRange". At this time, a boundary value of the event range is represented<br>
by event elements which indicate an event start and an event end. When the event start of<br>
the event range occurs, a logical value of the condition indicated by the "EventRange"<br>
element is "true". When the event end of the event range occurs, the logical value of the<br>
condition is "false". The event denotes an event that a management object value has a<br>
specific value or falls within a certain range. Therefore, the threshold, the threshold group,<br>
and the threshold range may be used in order to represent the event. For instance, an event<br>
in which the management object value has a specific value or falls within a range of a<br>
default value can be the event. One or both sides of the event range can be opened, and the<br>
range of which both sides are opened is referred to as an event range wildcard.<br>
[77] FIG. 8 shows definitions of operators and special symbols used in the Th element,<br>
FIG. 9 shows properties of the Th element, and FIG. 10 shows an embodiment for<br>
constructing a DM scheduling context using the Th element.<br><br>
[78] The embodiment shown in FIG. 10 indicates a DM scheduling context for 'Get,<br>
which instructs to process the command "Get of a node value when it is equal to 1200,<br>
1400, . . . , 3000, or every 60 seconds while the value falls between 1800 and 3000.<br>
[79] FIG. 11 is a view showing a construction of the DM system shown in FIG. 1 in detail.<br>
[80] As shown in the drawing, the DM server 100 and the DM client 200 (scheduling<br>
module and command processing module) include a plurality of function units required for<br>
performing such scheduling generating/establishing, DM scheduling performing, DM<br>
scheduling varying/deleting, DM scheduling status reporting, and the like.<br>
[81] A scheduling context generating/varying function unit 10 provided in the DM server<br>
100 generates the DM scheduling context, and requests the command processing module<br>
20 of the DM client 200 to install or vary the DM scheduling context.<br>
[82] A scheduling context installing/reconstructing function unit 31 generates a DM<br>
scheduling sub-tree to thusly generate a DM tree, when the DM server 100 requests to<br>
install/vary the scheduling context through a request transferring function unit 21 of the<br>
command processing module 20. The scheduling context installing/reconstructing function<br>
unit 31 may receive user confirmation, if required, before installing the scheduling context.<br>
[83] A command performing condition confirming function unit 32 confirms the scheduled<br>
command performing condition within the DM scheduling sub-tree, and continuously<br>
checks the state that the command performing condition is satisfied. For instance, whether<br>
the command performing condition is satisfied can be determined when another<br>
management object value existing on the DM tree corresponds to a designated threshold<br>
value, or in a specific time point, or according to whether a specific event has occurred in<br>
the device. When the command performing condition is satisfied, the command performing<br>
condition confirming function unit 32 performs the user confirmation process, if required,<br>
according to information of the user interface Userlnter within the DM scheduling sub-<br>
tree.<br><br>
[84] When the command performing condition is satisfied in the command performing<br>
condition confirming function unit 32 or a user permits a DM operation, a DM command<br>
performing function unit 33 requests a command performing function unit 22 of the<br>
command processing module 20 to perform the DM command.<br>
[85] The command performing function unit 22 performs the scheduled DM commands<br>
within the DM scheduling sub-tree according to the request for the DM command<br>
performing from the command performing condition confirming function unit 32. The<br>
command performing function unit 22 transfers a command performance result<br>
(status/result/generic alert) to the scheduling module 30 by a response message. The<br>
response message, for instance, includes command performance result codes with respect<br>
to that the commands have completely been performed, by which reason an error has<br>
occurred, how the device status is after performing the commands, or the like.<br>
[86] A status report gating function unit 34 filters data to be reported to the DM server 100.<br>
The status report gating function unit 34 determines whether the command performance<br>
result (status/result/generic alert) transferred from the command performing function unit<br>
22 should be reported to the DM server 100.<br>
[87] A scheduling context status reporting function unit 35 reports to the DM server the<br>
command performance result (status/result/generic alert) transferred from the status report<br>
gating function unit 34, and may report to another server the command performance result<br>
using an ACL information of the Mgmtsvr node. The scheduling context status reporting<br>
function unit 35 transmits a status report PDU (Protocol Data Unit) using a particular<br>
protocol (e.g., a generic alert), thereby performing the process for the DM scheduling<br>
context status reporting.<br>
[88] Preferably, the status report PDU basically includes PDUs (status PDU, result PDU,<br>
and generic alert PDU) for transmitting a status command language, a result command<br>
language, and a generic alert command language, and a termination request PDU for the<br>
DM scheduling context which a user is performing.<br><br>
[89] The command performing condition confirming function unit 32 and the DM<br>
command performing function unit 33 of the scheduling module 30 may be integrated in<br>
one function unit if necessary. The status report gating function unit 34 can also be<br>
integrated with the scheduling context status reporting function unit 35 if necessary<br>
(indicated by a dotted line).<br>
[90] Explanations will now be provided for functions of performing/varying/deleting the<br>
DM scheduling and of reporting the DM scheduling status in more detail with reference to<br>
the accompanying drawings. In this case, a DM session is established between the DM<br>
server 100 and the DM client 200. While the session is established, an authentication<br>
process between the DM server 100 and the DM client 200 is performed.<br>
[91] Function of Establishing DM Scheduling<br>
[92] Establishing the DM scheduling is requested by generating a Device Management<br>
(DM) scheduling context, connecting a DM session, and transferring the DM scheduling<br>
context to a device (e.g., a terminal) through a DM protocol.<br>
[93] That is, as shown in FIGS. 11 and 12, the scheduling context generating/varying<br>
function unit 10 of the DM server 100 generates a DM command and a scheduling context<br>
including a schedule with respect to a performing of the DM command. The scheduling<br>
context generating/varying function unit 10 transfers the generated scheduling context to<br>
the device (e.g., the terminal) through the DM protocol. Here, the scheduling context<br>
generating/varying function unit 10 adds the DM commands using an ADD command, and<br>
makes all the DM commands to be scheduled one group using an automatic command. As<br>
a result, the scheduling context generating/varying function unit 10 allows the device (e.g.,<br>
the terminal) to process the one group of DM commands all together. Also, the scheduling<br>
context generating/varying function unit 10 further includes a UI alert command in the<br>
automatic command, so as to receive the user confirmation before the device installs the<br>
corresponding scheduling context.<br>
[94] The scheduling context having transmitted from the DM server 100 to the DM client<br>
200 is transferred to the scheduling context installing/reconstructing function unit 31 of the<br><br>
scheduling module 30 by the request transferring function unit 21 of the command<br>
processing module 20 (S11).<br>
[95] After receiving the user confirmation according to the UI alert command, the<br>
scheduling context installing/reconstructing function unit 31 generates the DM tree 40<br>
using the DM scheduling context, thereby installing the DM scheduling context. The DM<br>
scheduling context, as shown in FIG. 1, is installed by generating the DM scheduling sub-<br>
tree 41 having at least one or more scheduling nodes (=DM objects) on the DM tree 40.<br>
When the DM tree is formed, actual values of a plurality of the scheduling nodes are stored<br>
in the common database 50. In particular, the Condition node value and the Commands<br>
node value having a valid XML document format are stored, respectively, in a command<br>
XML document and a scheduling information XML document.<br>
[96] Furthermore, when the DM scheduling sub-tree 41 is generated, the scheduling<br>
context installing/reconstructing function unit 31 certifies whether syntax and context of<br>
the XML document of the DM scheduling context transmitted are correct, and whether the<br>
DM scheduling context can be installed (e.g., an access authority of a server, capability of<br>
a client, etc). Afterwards, the scheduling context installing/reconstructing function unit 31<br>
notifies the DM server 100 of the installation result with respect to the request for<br>
installing the DM scheduling context (indicated as a dotted line).<br>
[97] Function of Performing DM Scheduling<br>
[98] After successfully certifying the XML document and thus generating the DM tree 40,<br>
namely, one DM scheduling sub-tree 41, the DM client 200 analyzes the scheduling<br>
information XML document of the database 50 to perform a scheduling process. That is,<br>
when the one DM scheduling sub-tree 41 is generated, the command performing condition<br>
confirming function unit 32 reads information of the DM command performing condition<br>
of the DM scheduling context from the scheduling information XML document by a<br>
constant period (Interval property of Th element), and then continuously checks the state<br>
that the DM command performing condition is satisfied (S12). Whether the command<br>
performing condition is satisfied, for instance, can be determined when another<br>
management object value existing on the DM tree reaches a designated threshold value, or<br><br>
at a specific time point, or according to whether a specific event has occurred in the device.<br>
[99] When the command performing condition is satisfied, if the user confirmation should<br>
be received according to the information of the user interface Userlnter within the DM<br>
scheduling sub-tree 41, the user confirmation process is performed. In the user<br>
confirmation process, a guide (i.e., notice, information, etc) related to performing the DM<br>
commands is provided on the screen, and accordingly the user can permit or cancel the<br>
performing of the DM commands. If the user cancels the DM command performing, the<br>
command performing condition confirming function unit 32 does not perform the<br>
scheduled DM commands but performs the process for confirming the command<br>
performing condition once again.<br>
[100] If the command performing condition is satisfied in the command performing<br>
condition confirming function unit 32, or the user permits the DM operation (S13), the DM<br>
command performing function unit 33 requests the command performing function unit 22<br>
of the command processing module 20 to perform the DM commands (S14). The<br>
command performing function unit 22 performs the DM commands scheduled within the<br>
DM scheduling sub-tree 41 according to the request from the DM command performing<br>
function unit 33, and transfers the command performance result (status/result/generic alert)<br>
to the status report gating function unit 34 by using a response message (S15).<br>
[101] The status report gating function unit 34 determines whether the command<br>
performance result (status/result/generic alert) is to be reported to the DM server 100<br>
according to a gating node value of the DM scheduling sub-tree 41 (SI6).<br>
[102] The status report gating function unit 34 provides a part of the DM command<br>
performance result to the scheduling context status reporting function unit 35 according to<br>
the gating node value (S17). The scheduling context status reporting function unit 35<br>
reports the corresponding command performance result to the status report processing<br>
function unit 11 of the DM server 100 by the status report transferring function unit 23 of<br>
the command processing module 20 (S18 and S19). At this time, the scheduling context<br>
status reporting function unit 35 transmits a PDU (Protocol Data Unit) using a particular<br>
protocol (e.g., a generic alert) and performs the process for reporting the DM scheduling<br><br>
context status. The status report PDU basically includes PDUs (status PDU, result PDU,<br>
and generic alert PDU) for transmitting a status command language, a result command<br>
language,	and	a	generic	alert	command	language.<br>
[103] That is, as shown in FIG. 13, the DM server 100 transfers the Dm scheduling context<br>
to the DM client 200 and requests the DM client 200 to generate the DM scheduling (S50).<br>
The DM client 200 having requested for generating the DM scheduling certifies the<br>
corresponding command (request), and generates the DM scheduling sub-tree using the<br>
DM scheduling context, of which result is then transmitted to the DM server 100 by the<br>
DM client 200 (S51 and S52). Afterwards, the DM client 200 checks the command<br>
performing condition of the DM scheduling sub-tree (S53). When the corresponding<br>
condition is satisfied, the DM client 200 processes the scheduled DM commands (S54),<br>
and selectively reports the processing result to the DM server 100 (S55).<br>
[104] Function of Varying DM Scheduling<br>
[105] As the DM server 100 varies the DM scheduling context which has already been<br>
installed and transfers the varied DM scheduling context through a DM protocol, varying<br>
the DM scheduling is requested (a process for transferring the DM scheduling context). Its<br>
signal flow is the same as that in the performing of the DM scheduling aforementioned. In<br>
this case, because the DM scheduling sub-tree already exists within the device, a Replace<br>
command can generally be used. When the process for transferring the DM scheduling<br>
context is performed, the DM server allows the DM client to manage all the scheduled DM<br>
commands by a group by transmitting the automatic command. In addition, when the<br>
process for transferring the DM scheduling context is performed, the user confirmation<br>
should be received before performing the process for varying the DM scheduling context<br>
by including the UI alert command in the automatic command. After receiving the user<br>
confirmation, the DM scheduling context installing/reconstructing function unit 31 of the<br>
DM client 100 reconstructs the DM scheduling context within the device.<br>
[106] That is, the DM scheduling context installing/reconstructing function unit 31<br>
generates a new DM scheduling sub-tree within the DM tree 40 using the new DM<br>
scheduling context having transferred, and notifies the DM server 100 of the processing<br><br>
result of the request for varying the DM scheduling context (indicated by a dotted line).<br>
[107] In other words, as shown in FIG. 14, the DM server 100 transfers the new DM<br>
scheduling context to the DM client 200 and requests the DM client 200 to vary the DM<br>
scheduling (S60). The DM client 200 having requested for varying the DM scheduling<br>
certifies the corresponding command (request), and varies the DM scheduling sub-tree<br>
using the new DM scheduling context, of which result is then transmitted to the DM server<br>
100 (S61 and S62).<br>
[108] Function of Deleting DM Scheduling<br>
[109] Deleting the DM scheduling refers to deleting the DM tree which has already been<br>
generated, namely, the DM scheduling sub-tree 41 within the DM tree 40 by the DM server<br>
100. The request for deleting the DM scheduling context is transferred from a scheduling<br>
context delete requesting function unit 12 of the DM server 100 to a scheduling context<br>
deleting function unit 36 of the DM client 200 (S20). At this time, the scheduling context<br>
delete requesting function unit 12 transmits to the scheduling context deleting function unit<br>
36 a Delete DM command using a URI of the DM scheduling sub-tree 41 to be deleted.<br>
Therefore, the scheduling context deleting function unit 36 deletes the corresponding DM<br>
scheduling sub-tree 41. As a result, the scheduling context deleting function unit 36 deletes<br>
the DM scheduling context that has been installed, of which result is notified to the<br>
scheduling context delete requesting function unit 12 (S21).<br>
[110] That is, as shown in FIG. 15, the DM server 100 transfers the Delete DM command<br>
to the DM client 200 and requests the DM client 200 to delete the DM scheduling (S70).<br>
The DM client 200 having requested for deleting the DM scheduling certifies the<br>
corresponding command (request) and varies the existing DM scheduling sub-tree, of<br>
which result is then transmitted to the DM server 100 (S71 and S72).<br>
[111] Function of Reporting DM Scheduling Status<br>
[112] The explanations have been provided for the case that the DM scheduling status<br>
report is performed by the status report gating, namely, the case that the command<br><br>
processing result is reported to the DM server 100. However, the DM scheduling status<br>
report can be performed when an error may occur while performing the process for<br>
confirming the command performing condition or when a user requests a termination of<br>
the scheduling context while the user performs the confirming process. In these cases, the<br>
scheduling context status reporting function unit 35 transmits the DM scheduling context<br>
status report PDUs to the DM server 100. The status report processing function unit 11 of<br>
the DM server 100 having received the control PDUs performs the DM scheduling context<br>
status report processing.<br>
[113] As aforementioned, in the present invention, the server transmits the DM<br>
command and the DM scheduling context including the scheduling information to the<br>
client within the device, and the client installs the DM scheduling context to thereafter<br>
perform the corresponding DM command according to the scheduling condition. As a<br>
result, it is effective for the server to dynamically manage the DM schedule of the client.<br>
[114] That is, in the related art, in order for the server to confirm a certain state of the<br>
terminal, the DM session should be generated and the status of the terminal should be<br>
questioned, periodically. This method has required great communication resources but no<br>
particular effect has been obtained. As a result, it causes waste of communication resources<br>
and shortening of battery using time. Therefore, as shown in the present invention, when<br>
the terminal is under a specific situation, the status of the terminal is reported to the server<br>
to thereby solve such problems.<br>
[115] In addition, many programs, for instance, diagnostic programs, status logging<br>
programs, virus detecting programs, and the like, may be installed or exist in the terminal.<br>
In case of utilizing the present invention, the DM server can perform the scheduling so that<br>
the programs can be performed at/in a desired time point or state. Once the performing of<br>
the program is scheduled, the server does not have to individually establish the DM session<br>
in order to perform the program every time, which leads to reduction of radio resource<br>
consumption. These advantages can be useful in a situation that a communication channel<br>
cannot be connected between the DM client and the DM server.<br><br>
[116] Furthermore, various parameters for operating the terminal correctly exist in the<br>
terminal. These parameters are determined as values by which the terminal can obtain an<br>
optimal performance. However, if the usage environment is changed while the terminal is<br>
used, the optimal parameter values may be changed according to the change. Therefore, by<br>
utilizing the present invention, the server detects the environment of the terminal to thusly<br>
perform the scheduling in order to use the optimal parameter values according to the<br>
detection. This adjustment for the parameter values can be performed in real time without<br>
any separate DM session, thereby providing user satisfaction and superior performance.<br>
[117] As the present invention may be embodied in several forms without departing<br>
from the spirit or essential characteristics thereof, it should also be understood that the<br>
above-described embodiments are not limited by any of the details of the foregoing<br>
description, unless otherwise specified, but rather should be construed broadly within the<br>
scope as defined in the appended claims, and therefore all changes and modifications that<br>
fall within that scope are to be embraced by the appended claims.<br><br>
