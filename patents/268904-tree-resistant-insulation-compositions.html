				<td>TREE RESISTANT INSULATION COMPOSITIONS<br>
CLAIM OF PRIORITY<br>
[0001] This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application Nos.<br>
60/953,309, filed August 6, 2007, and 60/018,625, filed January 2,2008, the disclosures of<br>
which are hereby incorporated by reference herein.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002] The invention relates to insulation compositions for electric power cables having<br>
a polyolefin base polymer and an additive comprising either low molecular weight wax or<br>
polyethylene glycol (PEG) and optionally further comprising one or more hindered amine light<br>
stabilizers, amine antioxidants and other antioxidant blends. The invention also relates to an<br>
insulation composition comprising a C2 to C8 alpha olefin in combination with a polyethylene<br>
homopolymer together with, optionally, one or more hindered amine light stabilizer and a liquid<br>
cre$ol antioxidant.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0003] Typical power cables generally have one or more conductors in a core that is<br>
surrounded by several layers that can include: a first polymeric semiconducting shield layer, a<br>
polymeric insulating layer, a second polymeric semiconducting shield layer, a metallic tape<br>
shield and a polymeric jacket<br>
[0004] Polymeric materials have been utilized in the past as electrical insulating and<br>
semiconducting shield materials for power cables. In services or products requiring long-term<br>
performance of an electrical cable, such polymeric materials, in addition to having suitable<br>
dielectric properties, must be durable. For example, polymeric insulation utilized in building<br>
wire, electrical motor or machinery power wires, or underground power transmitting cables,<br>
must be durable for safety and economic necessities and practicalities.<br>
[0015] One major type of failure that polymeric power cable insulation can undergo is<br>
the phenomenon known as treeing. Treeing generally progresses through a dielectric section<br>
under electrical stress so that, if visible, its path looks something like a tree. Treeing may occur<br>
and progress slowly by periodic partial discharge. It may also occur slowly in the presence of<br>
moisture without any partial discharge, or it may occur rapidly as the result of an impulse<br>
voltage. Trees may form at the site of a high electrical stress such as contaminants or voids in the<br>
body of the insulation-semiconductive screen interface. In solid organic dielectrics, treeing is the<br>
most likely mechanism of electrical failures which do not occur catastrophically, but rather<br>
appear to be the result of a more lengthy process. In the past, extending the service life of<br>
polymeric insulation has been achieved by modifying the polymeric materials by blending,<br>
grafting, or copolymerization of silane-based molecules or other additives so that either trees are<br>
initiated only at higher voltages than usual or grow more slowly once initiated.<br>
[0006] There are two kinds of treeing known as electrical treeing and water treeing.<br>
Electrical treeing results from internal electrical discharges that decompose the dielectric. High<br>
voltage impulses can produce electrical trees. The damage, which results from the application of<br>
high alternating current voltages to the electrode/insulation interfaces, which can contain<br>
imperfections, is commercially significant. In this case, very high, localized stress gradients can<br>
exit and with sufficient time can lead to initiation and growth of trees. An example of this is a<br>
high voltage power cable or connector with a rough interface between the conductor or<br>
conductor shield and the primary insulator. The failure mechanism involves actual breakdown of<br>
the modular structure of the dielectric material, perhaps by electron bombardment In the past<br>
much of the art has been concerned with the inhibition of electrical trees.<br>
[0007] In contrast to electrical treeing, which results from internal electrical discharges<br>
that decompose the dielectric, water treeing is the deterioration of a solid dielectric material,<br>
which is simultaneously exposed to liquid or vapor and an electric field. Buried power cables are<br>
especially vulnerable to water treeing. Water trees initiate from sites of high electrical stress such<br>
as rough interfaces, protruding conductive points, voids, or imbedded contaminants, but at lower<br>
voltages than that required for electrical trees. In contrast to electrical trees, water trees have the<br>
following distinguishing characteristics; (a) the presence of water is essential for their growth;<br>
(b) no partial discharge is normally detected during their growth; (c) they can grow for years<br>
before reaching a size that may contribute to a breakdown; (d) although slow growing, they are<br>
initiated and grow in much lower electrical fields than those required for the development of<br>
electrical trees.<br>
[0008] Electrical insulation applications are generally divided into low voltage insulation<br>
(less than 1 K volts), medium voltage insulation (ranging from 1 K volts to 69 K volts), and high<br>
voltage insulation (above 69 K volts). In low voltage applications, for example, electrical cables<br>
and applications in the automotive industry treeing is generally not a pervasive problem. For<br>
medium-voltage applications, electrical treeing is generally not a pervasive problem and is far<br>
less common than water treeing, which frequently is a problem. The most common polymeric<br>
insulators are made from either polyethylene homopolymers or ethylene-propylene elastomers,<br>
otherwise known as ethylene-propylene-rubber (EPR) or ethylene-propylene-diene ter-polymer<br>
(EPDM).<br>
[0000] Polyethylene is generally used neat (without a filler) as an electrical insulation<br>
material. Polyethylenes have very good dielectric properties, especially dielectric constants and<br>
power factors. The dielectric constant of polyethylene is in the range of about 2.2 to 2.3. The<br>
power factor, which is a function of electrical energy dissipated and lost and should be as low as<br>
possible, is around 0.0002 at room temperature, a very desirable value. The mechanical<br>
properties of polyethylene polymers are also adequate for utilization in many applications as<br>
medium-voltage insulation, although they are prone to deformation at high temperatures.<br>
However, polyethylene homopolymers are very prone to water treeing, especially toward the<br>
upper end of the medium-voltage range.<br>
[0010] There have been attempts to make polyethylene-based polymers that would have<br>
long-term electrical stability. For example, when dicumyl peroxide is used as a crosslinking<br>
agent for polyethylene, the peroxide residue functions as a tree inhibitor for some time after<br>
curing. However, these residues are eventually lost at most temperatures where electrical power<br>
cable is used. U.S. Pat. No. 4,144,202 issued Mar. 13,1979 to Ashcraft, et al. discloses the incorporation into polyethylenes of at least one epoxy containing organo-silane as a treeing<br>
inhibitor. However, a need still exists for a polymeric insulator having improved treeing<br>
resistance over such silane containing polyethylenes.<br>
[0011] Unlike polyethylene, which can be utilized neat, the other common medium-<br>
voltage insulator, EPR, typically contains a high level of filler in order to resist treeing. When<br>
utilized as a medium-voltage insulator, EPR will generally contain about 20 to about SO weight<br>
percent filler, most likely calcined clay, and is preferably crosslinked with peroxides. The<br>
presence of the filler gives EPR a high resistance against the propagation of trees. EPR also has<br>
mechanical properties, which are superior to polyethylene at elevated temperatures. EPR is also<br>
much more flexible than polyethylene which can be an advantage for tight Space or difficult<br>
installation.<br>
[0012] Unfortunately, while the fillers utilized in EPR may help prevent treeing, the<br>
filled EPR will generally have poor dielectric properties, i.e. a poor dielectric constant and a poor<br>
power factor. The dielectric constant of filled EPR is in the range of about 2.3 to about 2.8. Its<br>
power factor is on the order of about 0.002 to about 0.005 at room temperatjure, which is<br>
approximately an order of magnitude worse than polyethylene.<br>
[00131 Thus, both polyethylenes and EPR have serious limitations as an electrical<br>
insulator in cable applications. Although polyethylene polymers have good electric properties,<br>
they have poor water tree resistance. While filled EPR has good treeing resistance and good<br>
mechanical properties, it has dielectric properties inferior to polyethylene polymers.<br>
[0014] Hindered amine light stabilizers or "HAL"s are primarily used in clear plastic<br>
film, sheets or coatings to prevent degradation by light. HALs are used in unfilled polyethylene<br>
insulations. They are thought to prevent degradation caused by light emitted by tiny electrical<br>
discharges. US Patent No. 5,719,218 discloses an optically transparent polyethylene insulation<br>
formulation with a HALs where it is stated that the HALs are useful for the prevention of<br>
degradation of the insulation by water trees.<br>
[Of 15] U.S. Patent No. 4,302,849 to Kawasaki et al proposes the use of high molecular<br>
weight polyethylene glycol as a solution to electrical insulation deterioration in polyolefin<br>
polymers. This technology has become widely used in the electrical cable industry, however, it is<br>
over 25 years old and the need for more improved performance in additives for treeing resistance<br>
exists.<br>
[0016] Numerous methods to improve the performance of cross linked polyethylene<br>
(XLPE) insulation against dielectric deterioration by water tree generation and growth have been<br>
described in the literature. U.S. Pat No. 4,144,202 issued Mar. 13,1979, tolAshcraft et al relates<br>
to the inhibition of water tree growth by use of certain organosilane compounds. U.S. Pat. No.<br>
4,206,260 describes compositions containing an effective mount of an alcohol containing 6-24<br>
carbon atoms as being an efficient water and electrical tree retardant insulation. German patent<br>
2,737,430 discloses that certain alkoxysilanes act as tree retardant additives in polyethylene<br>
insulation. European patent 0,166,781, published Jan. 8,1986 to Sumitomo Electric Industries<br>
Limited describes a blend of ethylene and vinyl acetate copolymer as a water tree retardant<br>
material. Certain aliphatic carboxylic acid derivatives when incorporated in suitable mounts in<br>
XIPE are also reported to suppress water tree growth. Japanese application 63-226,814<br>
published Sep. 21,1988 and Canadian application 2,039,894 published Oct* 6,1992 to Sarma et<br>
al disclose an insulation composition comprising a low density PE in admixture with an<br>
ethylene-vinyl acetate-vinyl alcohol copolymer as a possible water tree retardant composition.<br>
[0O17J U.S. Patent No. 5,719,218 to Sarma proposes for improved water tree resistance<br>
for an electrically insulating cross-linked polyethylene composition for use in high voltage<br>
electrical cables, the cross-linked polyethylene being obtained by cross-linking a composition<br>
consisting essentially of 98% of a low density, peroxide cross-linkable polyethylene, 1-2% of a<br>
terpolymer of ethylene, vinyl acetate and vinyl alcohol and at least 0.15% of a stoically hindered<br>
amine stabilizer. Commercial acceptance of this formulation has been limited.<br>
[0018] Polymers containing peroxides are vulnerable to scorch, i.e., premature cross-<br>
linking occurring during the polymer extrusion process. Scorch causes the formation of<br>
discolored gel-like particles in the resin and leads to an undesired build up pf extruder pressure<br>
duritg extrusion. A good stabilizer package for peroxide cross-linked polyethylene for medium<br>
and high voltage cable insulation should protect the polymer against scorch during cable<br>
extrusion and provide long term stability after the cable has been produced, i Additionally, the<br>
cable quality would be negatively affected.<br>
[00191 Consequently, a suitable stabilizer system should provide low scorch. In addition<br>
to protection from scorch, the stabilizer system has an additional function. Alter the cable is<br>
produced, it is in service for an extended period of time (service life; long term stability). Often,<br>
the service life exceeds the intrinsic maximum stability of the polymer. Consequently, stabilizers<br>
need to be added in order to assure a suitable service life. During the cross-linking step, the<br>
interaction of the stabilizer with the peroxide should be as low as possible to ensure an optimum<br>
cross-link density resulting in optimal mechanical properties. Cross-linking assists the polymer<br>
in meeting mechanical and physical requirements, such as improved thermal aging and reduced<br>
deformation under pressure. Consequently, the stabilizer system, while suppressing scorch<br>
during the compounding step (and counteracting the effect of peroxides), should also have as few<br>
interactions as possible with the peroxide in later stage of the cable manufacturing process. An<br>
excess of organic peroxide may be used to achieve the desired level of cure, but, as described in<br>
EP 1088851, this leads to a problem known as sweat out Sweat out dust is an explosion hazard,<br>
may foul filters, and causes slippage and instability in the extrusion process.<br>
[0010] Other properties, such as the solubility of the antioxidant in (he polymer matrix,<br>
are also important A high solubility of the antioxidants ensures a low level! of blooming.<br>
Blooming may result in the generation of dust on the pellets, which can lead to health and<br>
environmental concerns. Additionally, additives that bloomed to the surfact might physically be<br>
lost and become unavailable in the polymer matrix for their intended purpose. Consequently, a<br>
suitable stabilizer package should have sufficient solubility with the polymef jmatrix. Further, a<br>
low enough melting point is required. A low melting point ensures a good dispersion of the<br>
antioxidant in the polymer matrix. Insufficient dispersion leads to decreased) performance of the<br>
additive in the polymer matrix. An additive with a melting point above the ijaximum processing<br>
temperature of the polymer (as determined by the peroxide) would result in jaj very poor<br>
dispersion of the additive in the polymer matrix. This is considered a substantial drawback. The<br>
most appropriate way to incorporate additives into the polymer would be in a liquid form. While<br>
the stabilizer system does not necessarily need to be a liquid at room temperature, it needs to<br>
melt at a low enough temperature to be easily filtered and added to the polymer in a liquid form.<br>
A liquid addition will have the further advantage in that the additive can be filtered, thereby<br>
increasing cleanliness. Increased cleanliness of the additive will further improve the cable<br>
quality. Consequently, it is desirable that the stabilizing system have a sufficiently low melting<br>
temperature and desired properties.<br>
[0021J U.S. Patent No. 3,954,907 discloses that vulcanizable ethylene polymer-based<br>
compositions, which are susceptible to scorching when processed at elevated temperatures, prior<br>
to vulcanization, and in the presence of certain organic peroxide compounds, can be protected<br>
against such scorching by the incorporation therein of monomelic vinyl compounds having a<br>
defined structure.<br>
(00221 U.S. Patent No. 5,530,072 discloses a process that is said to improve the<br>
modification efficiency of peroxides through the proper selection of anti-o*idant additives and<br>
control of the extrusion environment.<br>

Zeigler Natta Polymers<br>
[0049] A number of catalysts have been found for the polymerization of olefins. Some of<br>
the earliest catalysts of this type resulted from the combination of certain transition metal<br>
compounds with organometalric compounds of Groups I, II, and III of the Periodic Table. Due to<br>
the extensive amounts of early work done by certain research groups many of the catalysts of<br>
mat type came to be referred to by those skilled in the area as Ziegler-Natta type catalysts. The<br>
moat commercially successful of the so-called Ziegler-Natta catalysts have heretofore generally<br>
been those employing a combination of a transition metal compound and an organoaluminum<br>
compound.<br>
Metallocene Polymers<br>
[0050] Metallocene polymers are produced using a class of highly active olefin catalysts<br>
known as metallocenes, which for the purposes of this application are generally defined to<br>
contain one or more cyclopentadienyl moiety. The manufacture of metallocene polymers is<br>
described in U.S. Patent No. 6,270,856 to Hendewerk, et al, the disclosure of which is<br>
incorporated by reference in its entirety.<br>
[0051] Metallocenes are well known especially in the preparation of polyethylene and<br>
copolyethylene-alpha-olefins. These catalysts, particularly those based on group IV transition<br>
metals, zirconium, titanium and hafnium, show extremely high activity in ethylene<br>
polymerization. Various forms of the catalyst system of the metallocene type may be used for<br>
polymerization to prepare the polymers used in this invention, including but not limited to those<br>
of (he homogeneous, supported catalyst type, wherein the catalyst and cocatalyst are together<br>
supported or reacted together onto an inert support for polymerization by a gas phase process,<br>
high pressure process, or a slurry, solution polymerization process. The metallocene catalysts are<br>
also highly flexible in that, by manipulation of the catalyst composition and reaction conditions,<br>
they can be made to provide polyolefins with controllable molecular weight from as low as<br>
about 200 (useful in applications such as lube-oil additives) to about 1 million or higher, as for<br>
example in ultra-high molecular weight linear polyethylene. At the same tune, the MWD of the<br>
polymers can be controlled from extremely narrow (as in a polydispersity of about 2), to broad<br>
(as in a polydispersity of about 8).<br>
[0052] Exemplary of the development of these metallocene catalysts for the<br>
polymerization of ethylene are U.S. Pat. No. 4,937,299 and EP-A-0 129 368 to Ewen, et al., U.S.<br>
Fat No. 4,808,561 to Welborn, Jr., and U.S. Pat. No. 4,814,310 to Chang, which are all hereby<br>
are fiilly incorporated by reference. Among other things, Ewen, et al. teaches that the structure of<br>
the metallocene catalyst includes an alumoxane, formed when water reacts with trialkyl<br>
aluminum. The alumoxane complexes with the metallocene compound to farm the catalyst<br>
Welborn, Jr. teaches a method of polymerization of ethylene with alpha-olefins and/or diolefins.<br>
Chang teaches a method of making a metallocene alumoxane catalyst system utilizing the<br>
absorbed water in a silica gel catalyst support Specific methods for making ethylene/alpha-<br>
olefin copolymers, and ethylene/alpha-olefin/diene terpolymers are taught in U.S. Pat. Nos.<br>
4,871,705 (issued Oct. 3,1989) and 5,001,205 (issued Mar. 19,1991) to Hod, et al., and in EP-<br>
A-0 347 129 published Apr. 8,1992, respectively, all of which are hereby fully incorporated by<br>
reference.<br>

[0086] The present invention also includes the use of a stabilized peroxide cross-linked<br>
polyolefin composition as described herein as insulation media for medium fluid high voltage<br>
wire and cable. (For a description of a similar composition wherein the polyolefin is<br>
polyethylene, see EP 1074S80 A2 and EP 0966000 Al.) The organic peroxides useful as cross-<br>
linking agents are those well known in the art, e.g., dialkyl peroxides such as idicumyl peroxide.<br>
The load level range for the peroxide is usually 0.5 to 5% by weight. (For a description of such a<br>
peroxide, see EP 1074580 A2 and EP 0966000 Al.)<br>
[0097] The antioxidant blend can be added to the polymer as separate components, or as<br>
a pre-mixed powder blend, or as a pre-mixed no-dust blend (prepared by any process known in<br>
the art), or as a pre-dispersed blend in a polymer masterbatch or as premixed liquid blend. (For a<br>
description of appropriate processing equipment, see EP 1074580 A2 and EP 0966000 Al.).<br>
[0088] The blending of different types of antioxidants results in a tailor-made antioxidant<br>
system for peroxide cross-linked polyethylene having excellent scorch resistance, minimal<br>
peroxide interaction, sufficient long term properties to meet industry standards, a high solubility,<br>
and low melting behavior. It is to be noted that some of the antioxidants mentioned as being<br>
suitable components for the present invention have multi-functional properties, for example: (i)<br>
4,6-bis(octylthiomethyl)o-cresol is classified for purposes of the invention as a fast radical<br>
scavenger because it is a low hindered phenol. However, it also contains sulphur, which<br>
contributes to the long term properties, (ii) 2,2'-thiodiethylene bis[3,(3,5-di-t-butyl-4-<br>
hydroxyphenyl)propionate] is a highly hindered phenol that also contains sulphur. However, in<br>
this case both contribute mainly to the long term stabilizer properties, (iii) The highly hindered<br>
phenols and thiosynergists are actually two different classes of antioxidant but both exhibit the<br>
concept of the present invention in that they both contribute mainly to the long term stabilizer<br>
properties of the cross-linked polyethylene and somewhat to the anti-scorch property. Taking the<br>
above into account, for purposes of the present invention, the fast radical scavengers can be<br>
regarded as anti-scorch agents, and the highly hindered phenols and thiosynergists can be<br>
regarded as having the main function of long term stabilizers (even though they might also<br>
contribute to the anti-scorch properties).<br>
Other Ingredients<br>
[0089) Other additives commonly employed in the polyolefin compositions utilized in<br>
the invention can include, for example, crosslinking agents, processing aids, pigments, dyes,<br>
colorants, metal deactivators, oil extenders, stabilizers, and lubricants.<br>
Processing<br>
[0090] All of the components of the compositions utilized in the invention are usually<br>
blended or compounded together prior to their introduction into an extrusion device from which<br>
they are to be extruded onto an electrical conductor. The polymer and the other additives and<br>
fillers may be blended together by any of the techniques used in the art to blend and compound<br>
such mixtures to homogeneous masses. For instance, the components may be fluxed on a variety<br>
of apparatus including multi-roll mills, screw mills, continuous mixers, compounding extruders<br>
and Banbury mixers.<br>
[0091] In a preferred embodiment of the invention the additives are premixed with a<br>
small amount of polymer in a master batch. This master batch is added at the cable making<br>
extruder such that for example 10% master batch is added with 90% base polymer such that the<br>
resulting 100% mixture contains the additives in the desired quantity. In this way the cost of<br>
mixing is only attached to about 10% of the total composition.<br>
[0092] In tins embodiment or other embodiments preferably the orgjahic peroxide is not<br>
premixed with the polymer. The peroxide is injected into the cable making extruder in the<br>
desired quantity and it mixes with the polymers and or master batches while they are melted and<br>
extruded. This avoids a second costly and time consuming mixing or absorbing step with the<br>
polymers and or master batches before cable making.<br>
[0099] After the various components of the composition are uniformly admixed and<br>
blended together, they are further processed to fabricate the cables of the invention. Prior art<br>
methods for fabricating polymer insulated cable and wire are well known, and fabrication of the<br>
cable of the invention may generally be accomplished any of the various extrusion methods.<br>
[0094] In a typical extrusion method, an optionally heated conducting core to be coated is<br>
pulled through a heated extrusion dies, generally a cross-head die, in which layers of melted<br>
polymer are applied to the conducting core. Upon exiting the dies, the conducting core with the<br>
applied polymer layers is passed through a heated vulcanizing section, or continuous vulcanizing<br>
section and then a cooling section, generally an elongated cooling bath, to cool. Multiple<br>
polymer layers may be applied by consecutive extrusion steps in which an additional layer is<br>
added in each step, or with the proper type of die, multiple polymer layers may be applied<br>
simultaneously.<br>
[0095] The polyolefin compositions can be vulcanized using traditional curing<br>
procedures, such as chemical, thermal and radiation procedures. The curing agent can be a<br>
hydrolysable silane compound such as vinyl tri-methoxy silane grafted to the polymer backbone<br>
with an organic peroxide or grafted during polymerization of the polymer. The curing agents<br>
employed in the present invention can be organic peroxides, dicumyl peroxide and<br>
bis(terbutylperoxy) diisopropylbenzene. The peroxides act by decomposing at the cure<br>
temperature to form free radicals which then abstract a hydrogen from adjacent polymer<br>
molecules allowing the polymers to bond covalently to each other. To select the curing agents it<br>
is necessary to take into account the decomposition temperatures of said agents, in order to avoid<br>
undesirable problems during me mixture and extrusion processes. The curing agent amounts<br>
and/or ratios to be used will be defined based on the type of application. They are also based on<br>
theif compatibility with and or interference with the additive system.<br>
[0096) The conductor of the invention may generally comprise any suitable electrically<br>
conducting material, although generally electrically conducting metals such has copper or<br>
aluminum.<br>

Example 2 - Description of peroxide injection process<br>
[00111] The peroxide injection system is shown in Figure 1. If solid dicumyl peroxide is<br>
used, it must be melted in peroxide container in a 130 °F hot bath prior to injection. Melt<br>
dicutayl peroxide or liquid trigonox 101 peroxide with or without liquid Lrgastab Cable KV10 is<br>
dosed to polyethylene, if no masterbatch is added, by pumping them directly into the hopper by<br>
means of stroke head, located in the bottom part of the hopper. The peroxide injection speed is<br>
automatically adjusted by injection control panel based on the primary insulation extruder speed.<br>
The spray method provides good mixing of the liquid additives with polyethylene at an early<br>
stage. Coarse mixing takes place when the additives are directly introduced Into the hopper,<br>
followed by intensive mixing in the melting zone and especially in the mixing zone of the<br>
extruder.<br>
Example 3 - Square Wire Tests<br>
[00112] Square 14 gauge copper conductor wires with 30 mils of insulation were extruded<br>
with a 20:1 LB Davis standard extruder and a crosshead the and cured in steam at 400°F, Eight<br>
to ten 25 inch samples of these insulated square conductor wires were placed in a 75°C water<br>
bath and energized with 7500 volts. Time to short circuit was recorded. The purpose of the<br>
square conductor is to create an electrical stress concentration at each comet and accelerate time<br>
to failure.<br>
Accelerating Cable Life Test (ACLT)<br>
[00113] The power cables tested were prepared in accordance with the formulations listed in<br>
Table 1. The cables had a 1/0 19 wire stranded aluminum conductor surrounded by 15 mils of a<br>
conductor shield, surrounded by either 60 or 175 mils of polyethylene insulation as specified in<br>
Table 1 (representing the parts by weight) surrounded by 35 mils, of semicooductive insulation<br>
shield. A copper mesh was then wrapped around the insulation shield to provide the ground path<br>
for the shortout in the test The conductor shield was extruded first and then the insulation and<br>
outer shield components were extruded over the conductor at one time on a Davis standard<br>
tandem extruder and dry cured under pressurized nitrogen in a continuous catenary vulcanization<br>
tubq and water cooled. Table 1 provides the composition of the insulation materials in each of<br>
the tested cables.<br>
[0014] The Comparative Example cables and samples of cables made according to the<br>
invention were prepared for the test Samples were preconditioned for 72 hours at a 90 °C<br>
conductor temperature in free air. The center of each sample was immersed in SO °C water. The<br>
cable conductor temperature in me water was maintained at 75 °C for 8 hows each 24 hour<br>
period. For the remaining 16 hours, the heating current was turned off. The samples were<br>
energized at four times normal voltage stress (34.6 kv) until all test samples failed.<br>
[00115] The failure times were analyzed using extreme value distribution statistics (Weibull) to<br>
assess comparative mean life equivalency or enhancements versus control(s). For the Weibull<br>
distribution, the distribution parameters are ETA (a), the scale parameter and data (P), the shape<br>
parameter. The scale parameter measures the relative scope or largeness of the variable in<br>
question (life in days) while the shape parameters measures the variation (or range min. to max.)<br>
in the individual data (failure times) results of the population is sample. Both parameters of the<br>
test population best fit distribution were compared to a controlled population Results of the<br>
ACLT are shown in Table 2.<br>
[00116] Comparative example Formula 1 contains PEG tree retardant and an improved<br>
antioxidant known in the art to be suitable for tree retardant polyethylene. Comparative example<br>
Formula 2 contains PEG tree retardant and an antioxidant combination known in the art to be<br>
suitable for tree retardant polyethylene. Comparative example Formula DF42102 is a commercial<br>
PEG tree retardant polyethylene from the Dow chemical company. Comparative example<br>
XLWC085 is a "co polymer" tree retardant polyethylene from the Equistar chemical company.<br>
[00117] Example of the invention Formula 3 contains PEG and an inventive antioxidant<br>
combination. While it is known in the art to use this combination in electrical insulation it is not<br>
know to use them with PEG to achieve electrical performance better than is known in the art.<br>
[00118] Example of the invention formulas 5 and 5 A contain PEG and an inventive<br>
antioxidant combination. While it is known in the art to use HALS in electrical insulation it is<br>
not know to use it with an amine antioxidant with PEG to achieve electrical tree resistant<br>
performance better than is known in the art. It is known in the art that HALS and an amine<br>
antioxidant can reduce dissipation factor of certain polymers.<br>
[00119] Example of the invention formulas 6 and 9 contain a copolymer wax and an<br>
inventive antioxidant combination. "Co-polymer" insulations containing various polar polymers<br>
are know but they have drawbacks such as higher dissipation factor, high adhesion to the outer<br>
semiconductive shield and opacity when heated (in cable production the outer semiconductive<br>
shield is removed and the cable is heated to melt and make transparent the insulation to observe<br>
the quality of the inner semiconductive layer). The inventive copolymer wax advantageously<br>
gives lower adhesion of the outer semiconductive screen, is transparent and gives electrical<br>
performance better than is known in the art.<br>
[00120] Example of the invention formula 9 gives electrical performance equal to than is<br>
known in the art but has several advantages. It is more flexible than even EPR. The composition<br>
requires no separate compounding or master batching step. The polymer, KV10 antioxidant and<br>
cross linking agent can be added directly at the cable making extruder. This reduces cost and<br>
also chances for contamination at compounding or master batching.<br>
[00121] While the present invention has been described and illustrated by reference to<br>
particular embodiments thereof, it will be appreciated by those of ordinary skill in me art that the<br>
