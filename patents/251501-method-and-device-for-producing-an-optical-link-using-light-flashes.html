Method and device for producing an optical link using<br>
light flashes<br>
The present invention relates to a method and a device for producing an optical link by light flashes between a flashlamp and a receiver that receives said light flashes, most particularly a link to be employed in devices for locating and guiding missiles, such as for example as described in document US-4 710 028 (FR-2 583 523).<br>
In known devices of this type, the flashlamp may be mounted onboard said missile or else placed in a fixed station, the optical link then including a mirror mounted onboard the missile and sending said light flashes back toward said receiver.<br>
To be able to provide very long optical links, it is necessary for said flashlamp to be powerful, and it therefore consumes a large amount of energy. As a result, such a flashlamp is necessarily bulky and has to be provided with means capable of discharging the heat that it generates to the outside.<br>
The object of the present invention is to remedy these drawbacks by providing an optical link by light flashes of low energy consumption using a flashlamp that is not very bulky and does not require any heat dissipation.<br>
For this purpose, according to the invention, the method for producing an optical link, formed by a series of light flashes between a flashlamp and a device for locating a missile moving away from said locating device, each light flash being generated by an electrical discharge produced by capacitive means and applied to said flashlamp, is noteworthy in that:<br>
- said capacitive means are produced in the form of an arrangement of a plurality of capacitors; and<br><br>
-	the connection of said capacitors within said<br>
arrangement is controlled in a programmed manner in<br>
such a way that the resultant capacitance of said<br>
capacitive means increases from one flash to the next.<br>
Thus, thanks to the present invention, it is possible to vary the power of said flashlamp as a function of time so that the power is small when the missile is close to the locating device and progressively increases with the flashlamp/locating device distance, the power acquired at the maximum range of the missile being delivered only at the end of the range. Such a variation therefore reduces the energy consumption by the flashlamp, thereby reducing the heat generated in the flashlamp and therefore its volume.<br>
To implement the method according to the invention it is advantageous, on the one hand, for said capacitive means to comprise a plurality of circuit branches each comprising a capacitor and a controlled switch, said circuit branches being connected in parallel to one another between the anode and the cathode of said flashlamp, and, on the other hand, for the device to include:<br>
-	a high-voltage generator for supplying said<br>
-	capacitors; and<br>
-	means for controlling said controlled switches,<br>
-	making it possible, on the one hand, to charge said<br>
-	capacitors from said high-voltage generator and, on the<br>
-	other hand, to discharge said capacitors into said<br>
-	flashlamp so that the electrical discharge<br>
-	corresponding to a flash is larger than the electrical<br>
-	discharge corresponding to the preceding flash and<br>
-	smaller than the electrical discharge corresponding to<br>
-	the next flash.<br>
Preferably, said capacitive means include an additional capacitor connected in parallel to said circuit<br><br>
branches between the anode and the cathode of said flashlamp.<br>
In one advantageous embodiment:<br>
-	the capacitors of said circuit branches which,<br>
-	from the first to the last, have different<br>
-	capacitances, are classified in order of increasing<br>
-	capacitance;<br>
-	the additional capacitor has a lower capacitance<br>
-	than said first capacitor having the smallest<br>
-	capacitance among the capacitors of said circuit<br>
-	branches;<br>
-	the first flash of the series results from the<br>
-	discharge of just the additional capacitor;<br>
-	the second flash of the series results from the<br>
-	combined discharge of said additional capacitor and<br>
-	said first capacitor of said circuit branches;<br>
-	the third flash of the series results from the<br>
-	combined discharge of said additional capacitor and<br>
-	said first and second capacitors of said circuit<br>
-	branches;<br>
-	in general, the intermediate flash of index i of<br>
-	the series (i being an integer smaller than the total<br>
-	number of flashes in the series) results from the<br>
-	combined discharge of said additional capacitor and the<br>
-	i-1 first capacitors of said circuit branches; and<br>
-	the last flash of the series results from the<br>
-	combined discharge of said additional capacitor and all<br>
-	of said capacitors of said circuit branches.<br>
Thus, it is possible to obtain, at the end of the range of the missile, a high power for said flashlamp without the use of high-capacitance capacitors.<br>
Preferably, the device according to the present invention includes programmed means that are programmed according to the trajectory of said missile and drive said means for controlling said controlled switches and<br><br>
determine the time interval between two successive light flashes.<br>
Advantageously, such drive means are initialized, possibly with a delay, by the launch of said missile.<br>
The time interval between two successive light flashes may be fixed and the same for all the flashes of the series. However, it may be varied, for example according to an exponential law.<br>
In the usual case in which said flashlamp is of the type that includes a trip electrode, the device according to the invention includes a very high-voltage generator for supplying said trip electrode and this generator is controlled by said means for controlling said switches.<br>
The figures of the appended drawing will clearly explain how the invention can be realized. In these figures, identical references denote similar elements.<br>
Figure 1 illustrates schematically a method of locating a missile.<br>
Figure 2 is the block diagram of one embodiment of the light-pulse emitter mounted onboard said missile.<br>
Figure 1 shows a device 1 capable of locating a missile 2 relative to a reference axis X-X (for example a line of sight) , said missile 2 moving away at a constant speed from the locating device 1. The latter is, for example, of the type described in document US-4 710 028 (FR-2 583 523).<br>
For the purpose of locating the missile 2 by the device 1, said missile includes a flashlamp 3 capable of emitting light pulses 4 toward said device 1, which<br><br>
includes a receiver for receiving said light pulses (device not being represented otherwise).<br>
As shown in figure 2, the flashlamp 3 includes a grounded cathode 5, an anode 6 supplied by a control device 7, and a trip electrode 8 supplied by a very high-voltage generator 9 (for example one operating at the order of 10 kV). The flashlamp includes a cavity 10 that forms a reflector 11 and is closed off by an optical window 12. In addition, the cavity 10 is filled with a rare gas, for example xenon.<br>
The control device 7 mounted onboard the missile 1 comprises capacitive means 13, a high-voltage generator 14 (for example operating at 500 V) capable of charging said capacitive means 13, a control device 15 for controlling said capacitor means (13) and the very high-voltage generator 9, a programmed synchronization-pulse generator 16 for driving the control device 15, and an electrical power supply 17, for example a thermal battery, for supplying the generator 14, the device 15 and the generator 16.<br>
In the embodiment shown in figure 2, the capacitive means 13 comprise five capacitors Cl to C5 connected in parallel, the anodes of said capacitors being commoned, on one side, to the high-volt age generator 14 and, on the other side, to the anode 6 of the flashlamp 3.<br>
Moreover, the cathode of the capacitor C1 is connected directly to ground, whereas the cathodes of the capacitors C2 to C5 are respectively connected to ground via switches 12 to 15 (for example MOS transistors) controlled by the control device 15.<br>
Preferably,	the capacitance of the capacitor C5 is<br>
higher than	that of the capacitor C4, which is itself<br>
higher than	that of the capacitor C3, which is itself<br>
higher than	the capacitance of the capacitor C2, which<br><br>
is itself higher than that of the capacitor C1. For example, if the capacitance of the capacitor C1 is equal to C1, the capacitances c2 to c5 of the capacitors C2 to C5 may be equal to 2cl, 3cl, 4cl and 5cl, respectively.<br>
Since the capacitor C1 is permanently linked to the generator 14, it is charged by the latter.<br>
Upon launching the missile 2, a control command is sent to the programmed pulse generator 16 via a control line 18 in which a delay device (not shown) may optionally be interposed. In response to this control command, the generator 16 drives the device 15 so that it closes the switches 12 to 15 so that the capacitors C2 to C5 are charged by the generator 14. When a switch is closed, it remains in that state.<br>
Next, the operation of the device 7 and the flashlamp 3 takes place as follows:<br>
-	at time tl, the generator 16 emits a first pulse<br>
-	that is sent to the control device 15. The latter<br>
-	actuates the very high-volt age generator 9 so that the<br>
-	trip electrode 8 is raised to this very high voltage.<br>
-	Since the voltage across the terminals of the capacitor<br>
-	Cl is also applied between the cathode 5 and the anode<br>
-	6, it follows that an electric arc is generated between<br>
-	these electrodes, and said capacitor Cl discharges. The<br>
-	power of this brief arc, which forms a first light<br>
-	flash, is therefore proportional to the electric charge<br>
-	accumulated in just the capacitor Cl, which charge is<br>
-	itself dependent on the capacitance of this capacitor<br>
-	Cl. At the end of said first light flash, the control<br>
-	device 15, driven by the generator 16, deactuates the<br>
-	very high-voltage generator 9 and closes the switch 12<br>
-	so that the capacitors Cl and C2 are recharged by the<br>
-	generator 14;<br>
-	at time t2=tl+Atl after tl, the generator 16<br>
-	emits a second pulse and the control device 15, which<br><br>
receives it, actuates the very high-voltage generator 9. This results in the flashlamp 3 generating a second light flash, the power of which is proportional to the sum of the electric charges accumulated in the capacitors Cl and C2. At the end of the second light flash, the control device 15 deactuates the very high-voltage generator 9 and closes the switch 13. The capacitors Cl, C2 and C3 are then charged by the generator 14;<br>
-	at time t3=t2+At2 after t2, the generator 16<br>
-	emits a third pulse and, in response, the control<br>
-	device 15 actuates the very high-voltage generator 9.<br>
-	Thus, in a similar way to what was described above, the<br>
-	flashlamp 3 generates a third light flash, the power of<br>
-	which is proportional to the sum of the electric<br>
-	charges accumulated in the capacitors Cl, C2 and C3. At<br>
-	the end of the third light flash, the control device<br>
-	15, driven by the generator 16, deactuates the very<br>
-	high-voltage generator 9 and closes the switch 14. The<br>
-	capacitors  C1, C2, C3 and C4 are then recharged by the<br>
-	generator 14;<br>
-	at time t4=t3+At3 after t3, the generator 16<br>
-	emits a fourth pulse and, in response, the control<br>
-	device 15 actuates the very high-voltage generator 9.<br>
-	Thus, in a similar way to what was described above, the<br>
-	flashlamp 3 generates a fourth light flash, the power<br>
-	of which is proportional to the sum of the electric<br>
-	charges accumulated in the capacitors  C1, C2, C3 and<br>
-	C4. At the end of the fourth light flash, the control<br>
-	device 15 deactuates the very high-voltage generator 9<br>
-	and closes the switch 15. The capacitors  C1, C2, C3, C4<br>
-	and C5 are then recharged by the generator 14; and<br>
-	at time t5=t4+At4 after t4, the generator 16<br>
-	emits a fifth pulse and, in response, the control<br>
-	device 15 actuates the very high-voltage generator 9.<br>
-	Thus, in a similar way to what was described above, the<br>
-	flashlamp 3 generates a fifth light flash, the power of<br>
-	which is proportional to the sum of the electric<br><br>
charges accumulated in the capacitors  C1, C2, C3, C4 and C5.<br>
Thus it may be seen that, flash after flash, the power of said flashes increases up to a maximum when the missile 2 reaches its maximum range.<br>
The times tl to t5 and the time intervals Atl to At4 are programmed in the generator 16. Said time intervals Atl to At4 may be constant and equal. However, they may be variable.<br>
From the foregoing, it is readily understood that, thanks to the present invention, said flashlamp 3 is operated in a stable manner, with a programmed power variation, capable of preventing the flash detector (a CCD or CMOS sensor) from saturating at the launch of the missile. In addition, a substantial amount of energy is saved, enabling the range of the missile 2 to be increased for the same power. The substantial reduction in the heat generated by the flashlamp 3 that results therefrom makes it possible to reduce the size of the optical block associated with said lamp and to produce the latter from materials that are less critical, in respect of high-temperature resistance, than those currently used.<br>
