				<td>PROCESS FOR THE PREPARATION OF PHARMACEUTICAL INTERMEDIATES<br>
The invention relates to a process for the preparation of cyclopropyl benzyl ketone compounds of general formula (II) by the reaction of Grignard reagent prepared from compounds of formula (V) and cyclopropanecarboxylic acid dialkylamide compounds of formula (IV) which can be applied preferably on industrial scale.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Cyclopropyl benzyl ketone compounds of general formula (II) are important starting compounds of tetrahydro thienopyridine derivatives, which are used in the pharmaceutical therapy. One of the most important representatives of tetrahydro thienopyridine derivatives is compound of formula (I), namely 5-[2-cyclopropyl-l-(2-fluorophenyl)-2-oxoethyl]-4,5,6,7-tetrahydrothieno[3,2-c]-pyridin-2-yl acetate, having the international non-proprietary name prasugrel, used for the prevention and treatment of thrombosis and thromboembolism.<br>
The platelet inhibitor prasugrel, its derivatives, and the process for their preparation was described for the first time by Hungarian Patent No. 218 785 and Hungarian Patent No. 211 876. The object of the present invention relates to a process for the preparation of cyclopropyl benzyl ketone compounds of formula (II) in high purity, constituting a very important structural part of the above mentioned compounds. The process is very well-applicable on industrial scale.<br>
In the preparation process of prasugrel, and the effective platelet inhibitor compounds having a similar chemical structure, the key intermediates are the ketone compounds of general formula (II), which can have different substituents on the aromatic ring. The most important representatives of these compounds are the halogen substituted derivatives, especially those substituted by chlorine or fluorine atoms. From the literature only a few preparation processes of these derivatives are known which are narrowly applicable on industrial scale.<br>
According to the preparation process described in Hungarian Patent No. 218 785 and Hungarian Patent No. 211 876 cyclopropyl benzyl ketone compounds of formula (II) are prepared by the reaction of 2-fluorobenzyl magnesium bromide or 2-chIorobenzyl magnesium bromide and cyclopropanecarbonitrile. The reaction is carried out at the boiling point of diethyl ether, and the obtained complex is quenched with aqueous ammonium chloride, the product is extracted and purified by column chromatography. The yield of the process is 70 % or 69 %, respectively.<br>
Hungarian Patent No. 211 876 also describes another process, wherein the compound of 2-fluorobenzyl magnesium halogenide is reacted, instead of cyclopropanecarbonitrile, with an acid chloride, for example cyclobutanecarbonyl chloride. The reaction is carried out at a very low temperature (-70 °C), and the pure product is obtained by extraction and purification by column chromatography. The yield of the process is very low, 39 %.<br>
In the above mentioned Grignard reactions for the preparation of compounds of formula (II) it is possible that the ester, nitrile or acid chloride reagents react with two equivalents of the Grignard reagent, instead of one. These reactions reduce the yield of the manufacturing process, and some by-products, containing a hydroxyl group, can be derived from the process.<br>
In the preparation processes described in Hungarian Patents No. 218 785 and 211876, the Grignard reagents are obtained from bromo derivatives. According to the present invention, in the preparation process of cyclopropyl benzyl ketone compounds of formula (II), the Grignard reagent is obtained from the more suitable and cheaper 2-fluorobenzyl chloride instead of 2-fluorobenzyl bromide. Among the halogen derivatives, the use of chloro derivatives is more economical, because they are cheaper and the applied amount is less, because they have a lower molecular weight than the bromo derivatives.<br>
Preparation processes described in Hungarian Patent No. 211 876 are not suitable for the preparation of a drug on industrial scale, because the purification is carried out by column chromatography and this purification process is not suitable for the preparation of a large quantity of the final product. A large amount<br>
of reagents is needed for the purification therefore the process is more expensive and also very pollutive for the environment.<br>
Another disadvantage of the reactions known from the literature is that the carboxylic acid derivatives, namely the acid chlorides and the anhydrides - see the description of Hungarian Patent No. 211 876 - react with benzylmagnesium bromide at a very low temperature, at -70 - -50 "C. Therefore these processes -beyond the difficulties caused by the purification of column chromatography - are hardly applicable on an industrial scale and are energy-consuming and expensive reactions.<br>
In United States Patent No. 5874581 a process is described for the preparation of compound of formula (III), wherein two equivalents of 2-propyl magnesium chloride are reacted with 2-fluoroacetic acid in tetrahydrofuran, at the boiling point of the solvent. The obtained complex is reacted at a temperature of 5 °C: with ethyl or methyl cyclopropanecarboxylate. The reaction mixture is stirred for three hours and hydrochloric acid is added, then the mixture is neutralized, extracted, evaporated, and finally the fractions are obtained in vacuo.<br>
The disadvantage of the preparation process described in United States Patent No. 5874581 is that very expensive starting materials and more than two equivalents of the Grignard reagent are used in the synthesis. The yield of the reaction is 56 %, the purity of the final product is not mentioned.<br>
The aim of the present invention is to avoid the disadvantages of the above processes and to develop an economical, simple preparation process in a good yield, which avoids the purification by column chromatography and which can be applied advantageously on an industrial scale.<br>
The above mentioned aims are reached by the preparation process of the present invention.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The object of the present invention is a process for the preparation of compounds of general formula (II),<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
wherein R1 represents fluorine, chlorine atom or C1-4 alkoxy group, wherein the Grignard reagent, obtained from the compound of general formula (V),<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
<br>
wherein X represents chlorine or fluorine atom, is reacted with the compound of general formula (IV),<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
<br>
wherein R2 represents C1-4 alkyl group, having a straight or branched chain.<br>
According to the present invention for the preparation of the Grignard reagent preferably a compound of formula (V),<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
<br>
wherein X represents a chlorine atom, and 1.0-1.5 mol equivalents, preferably 1.0-1.3 mol equivalents of magnesium are used, calculated on the compound of formula (V), thereafter the Grignard reagent is reacted with 0.7-1.1 mol equivalents of compound of formula (IV).<br>
The C1-4 alkoxy group herein means such a functional straight or branched alkyl group having 1-4 carbon atoms which is bound to an oxygen atom.<br>
In the process among the dimethylamide derivatives preferably a compound of formula (IV) is used when R2 preferably represents a methyl group.<br>
According to the present invention the reaction is carried out in an ether type solvent, e.g. in diethyl ether, in ten-butyl methyl ether, in diisopropyl ether, in dibutyl ether, in tetrahydrofuran or in dioxane, preferably the reaction is carried out in diethyl ether, in /erf-butyl methyl ether or in diisopropyl ether, at a temperature between 20 and 100 'C, preferably at the boiling point of the ether type solvent.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The reaction of Grignard reagents with a carboxylic acid derivative is a well-known and often used method for the preparation of ketone derivatives. The Grignard reaction proceeds via a radical mechanism, therefore during the reaction a lot of by-products are prepared, for example dibenzyl derivatives and usually some other products (toluene, alcohol derivatives etc.) are also obtained by reduction. According to the state of the art, there is a possibility that the ester, nitrile or acid chloride reagents react with two equivalents of Grignard reagent instead of one. This significantly reduces the yield of the reaction and hydroxyl-group containing by-products are prepared.<br>
It was surprisingly found that when a cyclopropanecarboxylic acid dimethylamide of formula (IV), wherein R2 represents a methyl group, is reacted with 2-fluorobenzyI-magnesium chloride, the amount of the side products arising from the reaction with the second Grignard reagent, is significantly lower. The reaction is carried out at room temperature and compound of formula (III) can be obtained in almost quantitative yield.<br>
According to the present invention the Grignard reagent is prepared from the cheaper 2-fluorobenzyl chloride derivative, instead of the bromine derivative and this reagent provides a good yield in the reaction of cyclopropanecarboxylic acid dialkylamides. According to our experiments with other derivatives of cyclopropanecarboxylic acid, the product of the reaction can be obtained only in a yield of 5-17 %. At the reproduction of the reaction of Hungarian Patents No. 218<br>
785 and 211 876 (described in example 10), wherein the 2-fluorobenzyl magnesium bromide reagent was replaced by 2-fluorobenzyl magnesium chloride, it was found that reacting the Grignard reagent in ether with cyclopropanecarbonyl chloride at a temperature of -70 °C only 5 % of the product was obtained by GC/MS measurements. In example 11 reacting with cyclopropanecarbonitrile reagent under the same conditions but at a higher temperature, only 16,5 % product was obtained, beside a lot of different side products<br>
Accordingly another advantage of our process preparing a compound of formula (II) from cyclopropanecarboxylic acid dialkylamide of formula (IV) that the Grignard reagent is prepared from the cheaper benzyl chloride derivative. Preparing the Grignard reagent from the suitable benzyl chloride of formula (V), reacted on Grignard reagent with this cyclopropanecarboxylic acid dialkilamide, the yield of the reactions is doubled when compared to the reaction carried out with the bromo derivative of the Grignard reagent.<br>
If the Grignard reagent is obtained from 2-fluorobenzyl chloride, then the highest yield can be obtained with cyclopropanecarboxylic acid dimethylamide among all cyclopropanecarboxylic acid dialkylamide derivatives of formula (IV).<br>
We have studied, whether the most suitable cyclopropanecarboxylic acid dimethylamides with different substituents on the aromatic ring, have a similar reaction with the benzyl magnesium chlorides. It was found that the reaction could be carried out in a high yield with all examined substituted benzyl chlorides of general formula (V) [X=C1, R2=F, C1 or OMe], independently from the position (ortho, meta or para) of the substituent.<br>
The yield of the preparation process of our invention for the snythesis of compounds of general formula (II) is around 80 %.<br>
The reaction is carried out in an ether type solvent. Such ether type solvents can be the following: diethyl ether, tert-butyl methyl ether, diisopropyl ether, dibutyl ether, tetrahydrofuran or dioxane. It was found that the most suitable solvent is diethyl ether.<br>
The reaction can also be easily carried out in ter(-b\xty\ methyl ether, diisopropyl ether and dibutyl ether which are less inflammable.<br>
The process of our invention can be simply carried out on a plant scale, can be easily scaled up and does not need any special conditions or apparatus. The preparation process of the present invention can be optimally carried out on a plant scale, the conditions of the reaction are not extreme. Another advantage of our invention is that the use of toxic, environmentally dangerous, corrosive reagents is avoided together with technologies needing large amounts of solvents (for example column chromatography) or a very low temperature (e.g. -78 "C).<br>
The end product of our invention, compound of formula (III), which is in the scope of general formula (II), is an important starting compound of the derivatives of the pharniaceutically applicable tetrahydro thienopyridine derivatives.<br>
Prasugrel, compound of the formula (I) is prepared from compound of formula (III), synthesised according to the process of the present invention, by the chlorination or bromination of compound of formula (III) and the obtained compound is then reacted with 4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-thieno[2,3-c]pyridine, according to the manufacturing process described in Hungarian Patent No. HU 211 876. In position 2 of the thiophene ring, the oxo group is obtained by the methods known from the art and prasugrel of formula (I) is finally obtained by O-acetylation under basic conditions and, if desired, it is converted to its acid additional salts.<br>
