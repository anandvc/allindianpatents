				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>This is an invention for the preparation of a mixture of alkyl phenols. More particularly it relates to the process of preparation of mixture of 2,6 xylenols and o- cresol using an ortho selective catalyst.<br>
Alkyl phenols are the compounds having the alkyl groups substituted or replaced either in the<br>
phenyl ring or in the OH of the side chain. Cresols, xylenols, alkoxy phenols and trialkyl<br>
substituted phenols are some of the important alkyl phenols. These are industrially important<br>
chemical intermediates in the manufacture of Pharmaceuticals, pesticides, plastics and a variety of<br>
chemicals. The stringent specifications and the demand of these chemicals necessitate the<br>
development of catalytic systems and the processes for the selective production.	<br><br><br>
In the prior art the catalysts used for the alkylation of the reactions are ranging from zeolites to metal oxides. US patent 437174 describes a method for the alkylation of phenols using a Y zeolite but with this both cresols and xylenols are produced and no selectivity for 2,6 Xylenol. Japanese Patent 61-050935 reports the formation of p-alkyl phenols by reaction of phenol with anisole using a zeolite catalyst. US patent 4283571 describes a method for the isomerisation of o-cresol to isomeric cresols on zeolite catalyst like ZSM-12. Young in US patent No. 4283573 reported formation of p-mono alkyl phenols with long chain alcohols and phenols. Many other US patents like 4197413 and 4205189 describes the formation of alkyl phenols mostly the cresols. The published literature reports the use of catalyst systems varying from alumina, metal oxides, zeolites and acidic catalysts. Most of these reported catalysts are not selective to 2,6 xylenol. So far there is no report in the literature on the use of ferrite systems for the preparation of<br><br>
xylenols. The deactivation rate and the low selectivity to the desired material make these systems less adaptable.<br>
It is therefore desirable to provide a process for the preparation of a mixture of 2,6 xyienoi and o-cresol using an ortho selective catalyst composite matenal which produces negligible amount of cresol and in particular p-cresol, not more than 0.5% other xylenols and removes the drawbacks of the earlier systems. The inventors of the present invention have observed that the use of mixed metal oxide catalyst provided by the present invention removes the above mentioned drawbacks.<br>
The object of the present invention is to provide a process for the production mixture of alkyl phenols more particularly, O-cresol and 2,6-xylenol in high selectivity and with superior activity of the catalyst for longer durations using an ortho alkylation catalyst.<br>
Another object is to provide a process for the said improved catalyst that gives high conversion and high selectivity to 2,6 xylenols with low deactivation rates.<br>
Another object is to provide an unproved process for the preparation of an improved catalyst, which need not necessarily be produced in situ.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides an improved process for the preparation of mixture of alkyl phenols, which comprises contacting a catalyst such as herein described with a feed consisting of an alcohol and a phenolic compound at a temperature ranging between 250 to 400°C, at a pressure in the range of ambient to 150 psi. collecting the products at a temperature ranging between -5 to +5 C.<br><br>
In another embodiment the alcohol used is such as be lower alcohols such as methanol, or any other methylating agent such as dimethyl carbonate.<br>
In yet another embodiment the phenolic compounds used is such as be phenol, methoxy phenols, o-cresol or methyl methoxy phenol.<br>
In another embodiment the ratio of alcohol to phenolic compound is such as   vary from 7:1<br>
(WAV).<br>
In still another embodiment the space velocity of the reaction mixture is such as be in the range of 1 to 5 WHSV (Weight hourly space velocity expressed in terms of gms of feed per gram of catalyst per hour.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention the catalyst used has general formula<br>
MANBFe2O4<br>
Wherein M is a divalent metal such as cobalt, nickel, zinc, chromium, magnesium,<br>
mangenese and cadmium.<br>
N is any divalent metal other than M,<br>
A= 0 to 1 and B=0 to 1 and A+B=1<br>
Characterized by the XRD pattern as given in the table-1<br><br>
Table-1<br>
(Table Removed)<br><br>
having a surface area of 200 to 400 sq. Mts./gm and a pore size varying from 10 to 50 A°<br>
In still another embodiment the catalyst used is(CoFe2O4 ) which is seletced from the<br>
MI is cobalt M2 is nickel and MI = 1.0, 0.2 and 0.5 and M2 is 0, 0.5 and 0.8 and M3 is Fe wherein the selectivity of xylenol is not less than 60% and conversion of phenol is not less than 75%<br>
In a feature of the present invention the catalyst is prepared as per the procedure which comprises preparing the solutions of the source of rron, a source of a divalent metal and optionally a source of another divalent metal other than cobalt, separating the undissolved solids from the solutions by conventional methods, mixing the solutions in the stiotiometric ratio, adding this reaction mixture to an alkali solution, further adjusting the<br><br>
pH of the solution in the range of 9.0 to 10, heating the mixture to a temperature ranging between 50 to 70 °C, digesting the mixture at this temperature for a period ranging between 1 to 2 hrs. to obtain the precipitate of the product, cooling the precipitate, washing with water to obtain the product, drying the product at temperature ranging between 80 to 100 °C for a period of 24 to 48 hrs., calcining the product at a temperature ranging between 300 to 500 °C for 10 to 48 hrs.<br>
The process of the present invention is described herein below with reference to following examples which are illustrative only and should not be construed to limit the scope of the present invention in any manner.<br>
Examples 1 to 5 describe preparation of various catalyst material having different compositions.<br>
Example-1<br>
124 gms. of cobalt nitrate, and 344.2 gms. of ferric nitrate were dissolved separately each in 500 ml. of deionised water, and filtered to remove any suspended particles. These solutions were mixed together and an alkali solution containing 80 gms of liquor ammonia dissolved in 200 ml. of water was added to the mixture dropwise. The pH of the resultant mixture was adjusted to 9.4 by adding dilute ammonia solution. The mixture was heated to 70°C and digested for 2 hrs. The precipitated material was cooled to room temperature, filtered and washed free of nitrate ions. The precipitate was dried at 100°C for 36 hrs. and calcined at 300°C for twelve hrs. in flowing air. The dried material was powdered and sieved to the size of ~5 to 50 mesh. This gives catalyst CoFe2O4(100gms)<br><br>
