 Printable medium for the etching of silicon dioxide and<br>
silicon nitride layers<br>
The present invention relates to a novel printable etching medium having<br>
non-Newtonian flow behaviour for the etching of surfaces in the produc-<br>
tion of solar cells, and to the use thereof.<br>
The present invention furthermore also relates to etching and doping<br>
media which are suitable both for the etching of inorganic layers and for<br>
the doping of underlying layers.<br>
In particular, these are corresponding particle-containing compositions by<br>
means of which extremely fine structures can be etched very selectively<br>
without damaging or attacking adjacent areas.<br>
The problem of structuring oxide layers on a support material arises, for<br>
example, in the production of solar cells. A crystalline silica solar cell<br>
usually consists of a p-conducting substrate into which a layer of an n-<br>
conducting substance, for example phosphorus, of uniform thickness is<br>
diffused on the front side. A metallically conducting contact is applied to<br>
the front and reverse sides of the wafer for conduction of the current pro-<br>
duced on incidence of light. With regard to an inexpensive production<br>
process which is suitable for mass production, the contact is usually pro-<br>
duced by screen printing.<br>
Besides the oxide layers that have to be structured during solar cell pro-<br>
duction, silicon nitride layers also have to be etched. For the etching of<br>
corresponding nitride layers, the methods used have to be modified and<br>
the etching pastes adapted in a suitable manner.<br>
1. Prior art and object of the invention<br>
The surfaces of crystalline silicon solar cells are coated with thin inorga-<br>
nic layers during the production process, and optionally also after the end<br>
thereof. These layers have thicknesses in the range from 20 to 200 nm,<br>
in most cases in the range from 50 to 150 nm.<br><br><br>
Duririg the process for the production of crystalline silica solar cells, it is<br>
therefore advantageous in a number of process steps to etch fine lines<br>
into these inorganic layers of the solar cell;<br>
These openings in the surface of the solar cell can be used, for example,<br>
for the production of a so-called selective emitter, also known as 2-stage<br>
emitter. To this end, a high degree of n-doping, preferably by means of<br>
phosphorus diffusing in, is produced in a subsequent diffusion step in the<br>
partial openings of a diffusion barrier located on the silicon.<br>
In the present description, inorganic surfaces is taken to mean oxidic and<br>
nitride-containing compounds of silicon, in particular silicon oxide and<br>
silicon nitride surfaces. The mode of action of such diffusion barriers is<br>
known to the person skilled in the art and is described in the literature<br>
[A. Goetzberger; B. VoB; J. Knobloch, Sonnenenergie: Photovoltaik<br>
[Solar Energy: Photovoltaics], Teubner Studienbucher Stuttgart 1997,<br>
pp 40; 107]. These diffusion barriers can be produced in a variety of<br>
ways:<br>
Very dense silicon dioxide layers are obtained, for example, by heat<br>
treatment of silicon in an oxygen-containing atmosphere at temperatures<br>
in the region of 900°C (thermal oxide).<br>
Also known to the person skilled in the art is the deposition of silicon di-<br>
oxide by the CVD process. Depending on the way the reaction is carried<br>
out, a distinction is made here between, inter alia, the following proc-<br>
esses:<br>
-	APCVD (atmospheric pressure CVD)<br>
-	PE-CVD (plasma enhanced CVD)<br>
-	LP-CVD (low pressure CVD)<br>
A common feature of these processes is that the desired inorganic com-<br>
pound is obtained from the gas phase of a volatile precursor, for example<br>
silane (SiH4) or TEOS (tetraethyl orthosilicate) in the case of silicon di-<br>
oxide, by deposition of the precursor on the target substrate with decom-<br>
position.<br><br>
 Silicon dioxide layers which form a diffusion barrier can also be obtained<br>
by means of wet-chemical coating with a liquid or dissolved solid precur-<br>
sor in a solvent or solvent mixture. These liquid systems are usually ap-<br>
plied to the substrate to be coated by spin coating. These systems are<br>
known to the person skilled in the art as spin-on-glass (SOG).<br>
In many cases, the SiO2 layer applied also remains as reflection-reducing<br>
passivation layer. This is particularly frequently the case for thermally<br>
grown SiO2.<br>
Silicon nitride layers are used less as diffusion barriers in the art of crys-<br>
talline solar cells, although they are in principle likewise suitable for this<br>
purpose. Silicon nitride layers are mainly used as passivation and anti-<br>
reflection layers.<br>
It is also advantageous in the production of crystalline silicon solar cells<br>
to be able to produce openings in a targeted manner in the silicon nitride<br>
layers. An example which may be mentioned here is the application of<br>
electrically conductive pastes. These metal pastes are usually "fired<br>
through" the silicon nitride layer at temperatures in the region of 600°C,<br>
facilitating an electrical contact to the emitter layer. Due to the high tem-<br>
peratures, polymer-based (epoxy or phenolic resin) metallisation pastes<br>
cannot be used. Crystal defects and metallic contamination in the under-<br>
lying silicon also arise in the "fire-through process". Due to the system,<br>
the passivation layer is additionally completely destroyed by the overlying<br>
printed-on metal paste. A partial, narrower opening of the silicon nitride<br>
layer for electrical contacting would be more advantageous, with<br>
retention of the passivation layer in the edge regions, which are covered<br>
by the overlying metallisation layer.<br>
Besides the pure diffusion barriers consisting of silicon dioxide or silicon<br>
nitride, it is also possible to use thin glass layers in the production of<br>
crystalline silicon solar cells.<br>
Definition of glass:<br>
Glass is taken to mean per se a homogeneous material, for example<br>
quartz, window glass, borosilicate glass, and also thin layers of these<br><br>
 materials produced on other substrates (for example ceramics, metal<br>
sheets, silicon wafers) by various processes known to the person skilled<br>
in the art (CVD, PVD, spin-on, thermal oxidation, inter alia).<br>
Glasses below is taken to mean silicon oxide- and silicon nitride-con-<br>
taining materials which are in the solid amorphous physical state without<br>
crystallisation of the glass components and which have a high degree of<br>
structural disorder in the microstructure owing to the lack of long-range<br>
order.<br>
Besides pure SiO2 glass (quartz), all glasses (for example doped<br>
glasses, such as borosilicate, phosphosilicate, borophosphosilicate<br>
glasses, coloured, milk and crystal glasses, optical glasses) which con-<br>
tain SiO2 and other components, in particular elements such as, for ex-<br>
ample, calcium, sodium, aluminium, lead, lithium, magnesium, barium,<br>
potassium, boron, beryllium, phosphorus, gallium, arsenic, antimony,<br>
lanthanum, zinc, thorium, copper, chromium, manganese, iron, cobalt,<br>
nickel, molybdenum, vanadium, titanium, gold, platinum, palladium, sil-<br>
ver, cerium, caesium, niobium, tantalum, zirconium, neodymium, praseo-<br>
dymium, which occur in the glasses in the form of oxides, carbonates,<br>
nitrates, phosphates, sulfates and/or halides or function as doping ele-<br>
ments in the glasses, are covered. Doped glasses are, for example,<br>
borosilicate, phosphosilicate, borophosphosilicate, coloured, milk, crystal<br>
glasses and optical glasses.<br>
The silicon nitride may likewise comprise other elements, such as boron,<br>
aluminium, gallium, indium, phosphorus, arsenic or antimony.<br>
Definition of silicon oxide- and silicon nitride-based systems:<br>
Silicon oxide-based systems are defined below as all crystalline systems<br>
which do not fall under the definition of amorphous SiO2 glasses given<br>
above and are based on silicon dioxide; these can be, in particular, the<br>
salts and esters of orthosilicic acid and condensation products thereof-<br>
generally known as silicates by the person skilled in the art - as well as<br>
quartz and glass-ceramics.<br>
Furthermore, other silicon oxide- and silicon nitride-based systems, in<br>
particular the salts and esters of orthosilicic acid and condensation prod-<br><br>
ucts thereof, are encompassed. Besides pure SiO2 (quartz, tridymite,<br>
cristobalite), all SiO2-based systems built up from SiO2 or "discrete"<br>
and/or linked [SiO4] tetrahedra, such as, for example, mesosilicates,<br>
sorosilicates, cyclosilicates, inosilicates, phyllosilicates, tectosilicates,<br>
and other components, in particular elements/components such as, for<br>
example, calcium, sodium, aluminium, lithium, magnesium, barium,<br>
potassium, beryllium, scandium, manganese, iron, titanium, zirconium,<br>
zinc, cerium, yttrium, oxygen, hydroxyl groups, halides, are also encom-<br>
passed.<br>
Silicon nitride-based systems are defined below as all crystalline and<br>
partially crystalline (usually referred to as microcrystalline) systems which<br>
do not fall under the definition given above for the amorphous silicon<br>
nitride glasses/layers. These include Si3N4 in its α-Si3N4 and β-Si3N4<br>
modifications and all crystalline and partially crystalline SiNx and SiNx:H<br>
layers. Crystalline silicon nitride may comprise other elements, such as<br>
boron, aluminium, gallium, indium, phosphorus, arsenic and antimony.<br>
Etching of structures<br>
The use of etchants, i.e. chemically aggressive compounds, results in the<br>
dissolution of the material exposed to the etchant attack. In most cases,<br>
the aim is completely to remove the layer to be etched. The end of the<br>
etching is reached by the encountering of a layer which is substantially<br>
resistant to the etchant. In addition, there is the process known to the<br>
person skilled in the art of partial removal of a layer by etching to a target<br>
thickness which is usually defined.<br>
Etching of structures on silicon oxide- and silicon nitride-based glasses<br>
and other silicon oxide- and silicon nitride-based systems:<br>
According to the current state of the art, any desired structures can be<br>
etched selectively in silicon oxide- and silicon nitride-based glasses and<br>
other silicon oxide- and silicon nitride-based systems or surfaces thereof<br>
and layers thereof of variable thickness directly by laser-supported etch-<br>
ing methods or, after masking, by wet-chemical methods ([1] D.J. Monk,<br>
D.S. Soane, R.T. Howe, Thin Solid Films 232 (1993), 1; [2]J. Buhler, F.-<br><br>
P. Steiner, H. Baltes, J. Micromech. Microeng. 7 (1997), R1) or by dry-<br>
etching methods ([3] M. Kohier "Atzverfahren fur die Mikrotechnik" [Etch-<br>
ing Methods for Microtechnofogy], Wiley VCH 1983).<br>
In the laser-supported etching methods, the laser beam scans the entire<br>
etching pattern on the glass dot by dot or line by line in the case of vec-<br>
tor-orienting systems, which, besides a high degree of precision, also<br>
requires considerable adjustment effort and time.<br>
The wet-chemical and dry-etching methods include material-intensive,<br>
time-consuming and expensive process steps.<br>
A.	Masking of the areas not to be etched, for example by:<br>
» Photolithography: Production of a negative or positive of the etching<br>
structure (depending on the resist), coating of the substrate surface<br>
(for example by spin-coating with a liquid photoresist), drying of the<br>
photoresist, exposure of the coated substrate surface, development,<br>
rinsing, optionally drying<br>
B.	Etching of the structures by:<br>
•	dip methods (for example wet etching in wet-chemistry benches): dip-<br>
ping of the substrates into the etching bath, etching operation, re-<br>
peated rinsing in H2O cascade sinks, drying<br>
•	spin-on or spray methods: the etching solution is applied to a rotating<br>
substrate, the etching operation can be carried out without/with input of<br>
energy (for example IR or UV irradiation), this is followed by rinsing<br>
and drying<br>
• dry-etching methods, such as, for example, plasma etching, in expen-<br>
sive vacuum units or etching with reactive gases in flow reactors<br><br>
C. Removal of the photoresist:<br>
in the final process step, the photoresist covering the protecting areas of<br>
the substrate must be removed. This can be carried out by means of sol-<br>
vents, such as, for example, acetone, or dilute aqueous alkaline solu-<br>
tions. The substrates are finely rinsed and dried.<br>
Full-area etching of silicon oxide- and silicon nitride-based glasses and<br>
other silicon oxide- and silicon nitride-based systems:<br>
In order to etch silicon oxide- and silicon nitride-based glasses and other<br>
silicon oxide- and silicon nitride-based systems and layers of variable<br>
thickness thereof over the entire area completely or only to a certain<br>
depth, use is predominantly made of wet-etching methods. The silicon<br>
oxide- and silicon nitride-based glasses and other silicon oxide- and sili-<br>
con nitride-based systems and layers of variable thickness thereof are<br>
dipped into etching baths, which usually contain the toxic and highly<br>
caustic hydrofluoric acid and optionally additives of other mineral acids.<br>
The disadvantages of the etching methods described lie in the time-con-<br>
suming, material-intensive and expensive process steps which are in<br>
some cases complex in technological and safety terms and are frequently<br>
carried out discontinuously.<br>
International Application WO 01/83391 A describes etching media in the<br>
form of printable, homogeneous, particle-free etching pastes having non-<br>
Newtonian flow behaviour for the etching of inorganic, glass-like amor-<br>
phous or crystalline surfaces, in particular of glasses or ceramics, pref-<br>
erably SiO2- or silicon nitride-based systems, and the use of these etch-<br>
ing media. In particular on printing of surfaces, use of these particle-free<br>
media gave rise to problems due to inadequate resilience of the printed<br>
lines, dots or structures (inadequate structure fidelity), meaning that a<br>
significant broadening of the originally printed lines occurs (bleeding of<br>
the etching species on the substrate).<br>
US 5,688,366 A uses particle-containing etching pastes for the etching of<br>
a transparent conductive layer (for example ITO). The etching pastes<br><br>
used are prepared from molten iron chloride containing water of crystalli-<br>
sation, glycerol and polymer particles. These compositions are suitable<br>
for the etching of lines having a width of about 1 mm. Experiments have<br>
shown that these etching pastes are not suitable for the etching of very<br>
thin lines having a width of less than 1 mm cleanly and without flaws, ir-<br>
respective of whether polymer particles having a diameter of 0.01 µm or<br>
of 30 µm are employed for the preparation of the pastes.<br>
Objective<br>
The object of the present invention is therefore to provide novel, inexpen-<br>
sive etching pastes for the etching of very uniform, thin lines having a<br>
width of less than 100 µm, in particular of less than 80 µm, and of micro-<br>
fine structures on silicon dioxide and/or silicon nitride layers which are lo-<br>
cated on silicon solar cells. A further object of the present invention is to<br>
provide novel etching media which can be removed from the treated sur-<br>
faces after the etching under the action of heat in a simple manner with-<br>
out leaving residues.<br>
2. Description of the invention<br>
More recent experiments have now shown that, in contrast to previous<br>
experience, the printing properties of etching pastes can advantageously<br>
be improved if suitable, selected polymer particles are added. In this con-<br>
nection, polymer particles which form a network in the prepared pastes<br>
through physical interaction and/or chemical reaction with the other con-<br>
stituents of the medium, simultaneously causing an increase in the visco-<br>
sity of the composition, have proven particularly suitable. Entirely unex-<br>
pectedly, the added particles also contribute to an improvement in the<br>
printability of the medium.<br>
Given a suitable choice of the added particulate components, it may even<br>
be possible to omit entirely the addition of a thickener, which is usually<br>
homogeneously distributed in known particle-free pastes.<br><br>
The object of the present application is therefore achieved by the provi-<br>
sion of a novel printable etching medium having non-Newtonian flow be-<br>
haviour in the form of an etching paste for the etching of inorganic, glass-<br>
like or crystalline surfaces selected from the group of glasses based on<br>
silicon oxide and glasses based on silicon nitride,<br>
which comprises polymer particles consisting of a material selected from<br>
the group of polystyrene, polyacryl, polyamide, polyimide, polymeth-<br>
acrylate, melamine, urethane, benzoguanine, phenolic resin, silicone<br>
resin, fluorinated polymers (PTFE, PVDF, inter alia) and micronised wax,<br>
in the presence of an etching component, solvent, thickener, optionally at<br>
least one inorganic and/or organic acid, and optionally additives, such as<br>
antifoams, thixotropic agents, flow-control agents, deaerators, adhesion<br>
promoters. The etching medium according to the invention is effective<br>
even at temperatures of 15 to 50°C or can optionally be activated by in-<br>
put of energy. Preferred forms of the pastes according to the invention<br>
and use thereof arise from Claims 2-18. The present invention further-<br>
more relates to a process for the etching and optionally for the simulta-<br>
neous doping of inorganic, glass-like, crystalline surfaces according to<br>
Claims 29 and 33. Claim 28 relates to particular embodiments of the use<br>
of the etching pastes according to the invention.<br>
3. Detailed description of the invention<br>
In accordance with the invention, the novel etching pastes having thixo-<br>
tropic, non-Newtonian properties are used to structure silicon dioxide or<br>
nitride layers in a suitable manner during the process for the production<br>
of products for photovoltaics, semiconductor technology, high-perform-<br>
ance electronics, of solar cells or photodiodes. To this end, the paste is<br>
printed in a single process step onto the surface to be etched and re-<br>
moved again after a pre-specified reaction time. In this way, the surface<br>
is etched and structured in the printed areas, while unprinted areas re-<br>
main in the original state.<br>
The surface to be etched here can be a surface or part-surface of silicon<br>
oxide- or silicon nitride-based glass and other silicon oxide- and silicon<br>
nitride-based systems, and/or a surface or part-surface of a porous and<br><br>
1	&gt;<br>
non-porous layer of glass and other silicon oxide- and silicon nitride-<br>
based systems on a support material.<br>
A suitable process having a high degree of automation and having high<br>
throughput utilises printing technology for the transfer of the etching<br>
paste to the substrate surface to be etched. In particular, the screen, pad,<br>
stamp, ink-jet printing processes are printing processes that are known to<br>
the person skilled in the art. Manual application is likewise possible.<br>
Depending on the screen, plate or stamp design or cartridge addressing,<br>
it is possible to apply the printable, homogeneous, particle-free etching<br>
pastes having non-Newtonian flow behaviour which are described in ac-<br>
cordance with the invention over the entire area or selectively in accor-<br>
dance with the etch structure pattern only in the areas where etching is<br>
desired. All masking and lithography steps which are otherwise neces-<br>
sary are thus superfluous. The etching operation can be carried out with<br>
or without energy input, for example in the form of heat radiation (using<br>
IR lamps).<br>
The actual etching process is subsequently completed by washing the<br>
surfaces with water and/or a suitable solvent. More precisely, the print-<br>
able, polymer particle-containing etching pastes having non-Newtonian<br>
flow behaviour are rinsed off the etched areas using a suitable solvent<br>
after etching is complete.<br>
Use of the etching pastes according to the invention thus enables long<br>
runs to be etched inexpensively on an industrial scale in a suitable,<br>
automated process.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the etching paste according to the invention<br>
has a viscosity in the range from 10 to 500 Pas, preferably from 50 to<br>
200 Pas. The viscosity is the material-dependent component of the fac-<br>
tional resistance which counters movement when adjacent liquid layers<br>
are displaced. According to Newton, the shear resistance in a liquid layer<br>
between two sliding surfaces arranged parallel and moved relative to one<br>
another is proportional to the velocity or shear gradient G. The propor-<br>
tionality factor is a material constant which is known as the dynamic vis-<br>
cosity and has the dimension m Pa.s. In Newtonian liquids, the propor-<br><br>
tionality factor is pressure- and temperature-dependent. The degree of<br>
dependence here is determined by the materia! composition. Liquids or<br>
substances having an in homogeneous composition have non-Newtonian<br>
properties. The viscosity of these substances is additionally dependent<br>
on the shear gradient.<br>
For the etching of fine structures, having line widths of 
printed etching media,it has now been found to be particularly advanta-<br>
geous to thicken etching media completely or partially using finely divided<br>
particulate systems instead of particle-free etching pastes comprising a<br>
homogeneously distributed polymer (types see WO 01/83391 A) for<br>
thickening. Particularly suitable for this purpose are polymer particles<br>
which interact with the other components of the composition and form a<br>
network by means of chemical bonds or a purely physical interaction at<br>
the molecular level. The relative particle diameters of these systems can<br>
be in the range from 10 nm to 30 urn. Corresponding polymer particles<br>
having a relative particle diameter in the range from 1 to 10 µm have<br>
proved particularly advantageous. Particles which are particularly suitable<br>
for the purpose according to the invention can consist of the following<br>
materials:<br>
-	polystyrene<br>
-	polyacryl<br>
-	polyamide<br>
-	polyethylene<br>
-	ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer<br>
-	ethylene-acrylic acid-acrylate terpolymer<br>
-	ethylene-acrylate-maleic anhydride terpolymer<br>
-	polypropylene<br>
-	polyimide<br>
-	polymethacrylate<br>
-	melamine, urethane, benzoguanine, phenolic resin<br>
-	silicone resin<br>
-	fluorinated polymers (PTFE, PVDF), and<br>
-	micronised waxes<br><br>
The use of a very finely divided polyethylene powder, which is, for exam-<br>
ple, currently marketed by DuPont PolymerPowders Switzerland under<br>
the trade name COATHYLENE HX® 1681, having relative particle dia-<br>
meters d50 value of 10 µm, has proven particularly suitable in the experi-<br>
ments.<br>
These particulate thickeners can be added to the etching medium in<br>
amounts of 1 to 50% by weight, advantageously in the range from 10 to<br>
50% by weight, in particular from 25 to 35% by weight.<br>
Also suitable in principle are particulate polymeric thickeners based on<br>
-	polystyrene<br>
-	polyacryl<br>
-	polyamide<br>
-	polyimide<br>
-	polymethacrylate<br>
-	melamine, urethane, benzoguanine, phenolic resin<br>
-	silicone resin.<br>
Compared with the particle-free etching pastes described in<br>
WO 01/83391 A, the addition of the particulate thickeners according to<br>
the invention has enabled the following improvements to be achieved:<br>
I. Particulate thickening results in improved resilience of the etching<br>
medium. The particles form a skeleton-structure in the etching me-<br>
dium. Similar structures are known to the person skilled in the art<br>
from highly dispersed silicic acid (for example Aerosil®). In particular<br>
in screen printing of the etching pastes, a broadening of the printed<br>
structures due to flow can be substantially prevented or at least<br>
greatly restricted by the present invention. The printed, and thus<br>
paste-covered area therefore corresponds substantially to the area<br>
specified in the screen layout. Many inorganic particles, such as, for<br>
example, silicic acid or modified silicic acid, cannot be employed for<br>
thickening the etching medium owing to their reactivity with the etch-<br>
ing component employed. For example, a chemical reaction of silicic<br>
acid with NH4HF2 takes place if the latter serves as etching compo-<br>
nent.<br><br>
II.	With the aid of particulate thickening, lines of greater print height with<br>
retained width are, in addition, printed on use of the same screen or<br>
mask than on use of corresponding particle-free pastes, as de-<br>
scribed, for example, in WO 01/83391 A. This simultaneously results<br>
in a greater application rate of etching component per unit area. If<br>
relatively thick silicon dioxide or silicon nitride layers (&gt; 100 nm) are<br>
to be etched, this is a particular advantage for complete etching.<br>
III.	The more pronounced non-Newtonian or thixotropic properties of the<br>
etching paste have a particularly advantageous effect for screen<br>
printing and result in considerably improved results. In particular, this<br>
is evident in a shortened etching time or an increased etching rate for<br>
the same etching time and especially in a greater etching depth in the case of relatively thick layers.<br>
IV.	The thickening associated with the addition of polymer particles ac-<br>
cording to the invention results in a considerably lower binding capa-<br>
city of the etching paste. Given a specific choice of the particles<br>
added, an increased etching rate and thus a considerably increased<br>
etching depth are, surprisingly, achieved for the same amount of<br>
added etching component.<br>
V.	The significantly greater print height achieved under the same<br>
printing conditions, i.e. on use of the same screen and the same<br>
printing parameters, furthermore causes significantly delayed drying<br>
of the printed etching species. This enables the etching species to act<br>
on the substrate for longer. It is particularly important in the case of<br>
accelerated etching under elevated temperatures. In addition, the<br>
material remaining after the etching process can be removed<br>
significantly more easily in the final cleaning process.<br>
Significant improvements in the present compositions arise; in particular,<br>
through a considerably improved screen-printing behaviour, enabling<br>
continuous printing of surfaces to be treated without interruptions.The<br>
use of the etching pastes according to the invention enables considerably<br>
finer etching structures since the pastes have greater viscosities on addi-<br>
tion of the same amounts of thickener in the presence of polymer parti-<br><br>
cles. This enables the pastes to be applied in printing with a higher paste layer and consequently for the layers to be etched deeper. The improved<br>
rinsing behaviour (wafer cleaning) after etching also shortens the time<br>
required for subsequent cleaning.<br>
Surprisingly, experiments have shown that the addition of corresponding<br>
fine polymer particles also has an advantageous effect in processes for<br>
the selective etching of inorganic surfaces for the production of selective<br>
emitter structures in solar cells, in which, besides etching, specific phos-<br>
phorus doping for the production of n++ regions is also desired. Corre-<br>
sponding etching and doping pastes are described, for example, in WO<br>
03/034504 A1. In contrast to the pure etching pastes, these pastes, after<br>
application to the wafer surfaces to be etched, are heated over the entire<br>
surface or locally depending on the particles present in the paste to tem-<br>
peratures in the range from 250 to 350°C for from 30 to 120 seconds and<br>
optionally, for additional n++ doping, to temperatures &gt;800°C, in particular<br>
to temperatures in the range from 800 to 1050°C, for 20 - 40 minutes.<br>
The selected temperature is of course set in such a way that changes in<br>
the particles present in the paste do not give rise to any disadvantages.<br>
Corresponding etching media may comprise the various forms of phos-<br>
phoric acid or suitable phosphoric acid salts or compounds, which are<br>
decomposed to the corresponding phosphoric acid on heating, as etching<br>
and as doping components.<br>
It has been found that orthophosphoric acid, metaphosphoric acid, pyro-<br>
phosphoric acid and salts thereof and here in particular the ammonium<br>
salts ((NH4)2HPO4, NH4H2PO4, (NH4)3PO4) and other compounds which<br>
form one of these compounds on thermal decomposition are capable of<br>
completely etching away silicon nitride layers having a layer thickness of<br>
70 mm within a few seconds to minutes at temperatures above 250°C. At<br>
300°C, the etching time is about 60 seconds.<br>
For the preparation of the particle-containing media according to the in-<br>
vention, the solvents, etching components, thickeners, particles and ad-<br>
ditives are mixed successively with one another and stirred for a suffi-<br>
cient time until a viscous paste having thixotropic properties has formed.<br><br>
The stirring can-be carried put with warming to a suitable temperature. The, components are usually stirred with one another at room tempera-<br>
ture.<br>
Preferred uses of the printable etching pastes according to the invention<br>
arise for the described processes for the structuring of oxide layers ap-<br>
plied to a support material, for the production of solar cells having a se-<br>
lective emitter layer on the light incidence side and for the production of<br>
solar cells having a selective emitter layer on the light incidence side and<br>
a back-surface field on the back.<br>
For application of the pastes to the areas to be treated, the etching<br>
pastes can be printed through a fine-mesh screen which contains the<br>
print template (or etched metal screen). In a further step, the pastes can<br>
be baked in the screen-printing process by the thick-layer method<br>
(screen printing of conductive metal pastes), enabling the electrical and<br>
mechanical properties to be fixed. On use of the etching pastes<br>
according to the invention, the baking (firing through the dielectric layers)<br>
can instead also be omitted and the applied etching pastes washed off<br>
with a suitable solvent or solvent mixture after a certain reaction time.<br>
The etching action is terminated by the washing-off.<br>
Particularly suitable printing methods are essentially screen printing with<br>
screen separation or stencil printing without separation. In screen print-<br>
ing, the separation a of a screen is usually several hundred µm with a tilt<br>
angle a between the edge of the squeegee, which pushes the etching<br>
printing paste over the screen, and the screen. The screen is held by a<br>
screen frame, while the squeegee is passed over the screen at a squee-<br>
gee velocity v and a squeegee pressure P. In the process, the etching<br>
paste is pushed over the screen. During this operation, the screen comes<br>
into contact with the substrate in the form of a line over the squeegee<br>
width. The contact between screen and substrate transfers the vast ma-<br>
jority of the screen printing paste located in the free screen meshes onto<br>
the substrate. In the areas covered by the screen meshes, no screen<br>
printing paste is transferred onto the substrate. This enables screen print-<br>
ing paste to be transferred in a targeted manner to certain areas of the<br>
substrate.<br><br><br>
After the end of the movement E, the squeegee is raised off the screen. The screen is tensioned uniformly using a screen stretcher with hydrau-<br>
lic/pneumatic tension and clamping device. The screen tension is moni-<br>
tored by defined sag of the screen in a certain area at a certain weight<br>
using a dial gauge. With specific pneumatic/hydraulic printing machines,<br>
the squeegee pressure (P), the printing velocity (V), the off-contact dis-<br>
tance (A) and the squeegee path (horizontal and vertical, squeegee an-<br>
gle) can be set with various degrees of automation of the working steps<br>
for trial and production runs.<br>
Printing screens used here usually consist of plastic or steel-wire cloth. It<br>
is possible for the person skilled in the art to select cloths having different<br>
wire diameters and mesh widths, depending on the desired layer thick-<br>
ness and line width. These cloths are structured directly or indirectly us-<br>
ing photosensitive materials (emulsion layer). For the printing of extreme-<br>
ly fine lines and in the case of requisite high precision of successive<br>
prints, it may be advantageous to use metal stencils, which are likewise<br>
provided directly or indirectly with a hole structure or line structure.<br>
In order to carry out the etching, an etching paste, as described, for ex-<br>
ample, in Example 1, is prepared. Using an etching paste of this type, a<br>
thermal SiO2 having a thickness of approx. 100 nm can be removed se-<br>
lectively within 60 seconds at 50°C after screen printing. The etching is<br>
subsequently terminated by dipping the Si wafer into water and then<br>
rinsing with the aid of a fine water spray.<br>
For the production of solar cells, wafers comprising p-doped Pz silicon<br>
having  orientation, for example, are selected. In these, a short,<br>
basic etching enables a structure to be produced on the surface which<br>
improves the light incidence geometry for reducing reflections. A thin<br>
dopant coating film comprising a boron-containing compound can be<br>
spin-coated onto the back and dried. The wafers prepared in this way are<br>
placed in a tray and introduced into an oven pre-heated to 1000 to<br>
1100°C. An oxygen atmosphere is established in the oven, so that an<br>
oxide layer forms directly on all wafer surfaces that are not covered by<br>
the boron dopant coating film. At the same time, boron is expelled from<br>
the dopant coating film and diffuses into the back of the wafers. p+-doped<br><br>
regions with a depth of approx. 1 to 5 µm form. This embodiment of a<br>
solar cell is known to the person skilled in the art under the term "back-<br>
surface field". The oxide layers formed on the front can now be structured<br>
using the etching pastes described above.<br>
For example, these oxide layers can be formed as masks for high n+-<br>
phosphorus dopings for the formation of selective emitter layers, while<br>
significantly less n+-doping is aimed at in the masked areas.<br>
After opening of the pn junction, which would result in short circuits in the<br>
solar cell, for example by plasma etching or opening using a LASER<br>
beam, the electrical contacts are applied to the front and back of the cell.<br>
This can be carried out by means of two successive screen-printing steps<br>
using a paste, which may, besides the binders and oxidic additives, com-<br>
prise conductive silver particles and/or aluminium. After the printing, the<br>
printed contacts are baked at about 700 to 800°C.<br>
The present description enables the person skilled in the art to use the<br>
invention comprehensively. If anything is unclear, it goes without saying<br>
that the cited publications and patent literature should be used. Corre-<br>
spondingly, these documents are regarded as part of the disclosure con-<br>
tent of the present description.<br>
