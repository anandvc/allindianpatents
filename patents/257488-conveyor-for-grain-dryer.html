				<td>CONVEYOR FOR GRAIN DRYER FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0001]     The present invention relates generally to grain dryers and more particularly to a metering conveyor for use with grain dryers. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002] Continuous flow grain dryers generally include a column of drain which flows by gravity between parallel perforated walls. Heated air is forced through the perforated walls, thereby drying the grain. A metering system is generally incorporated in the lower portion of the grain dryer. The metering system is typically coupled to a control system that controls the discharge rate of grain exiting the dryer. Typically, it is desirable to dry grain to a preselected moisture content for storage or use. In order 10 attain a target moisture content for grain discharged from a grain dryer, the grain discharge rate should be accurately controlled.<br>
[0003] Modular rectangular grain dryers can be supplied in varying lengths to accommodate various volumetric flow rates of grain, depending upon demand. A single discharge within a modular grain dryer requires that the grain discharge or metering rate be adjustable for the modular diyers in order to ensure a uniform moisture content of grain that is dried. Typically, rectangular grain dryers utilize metering rolls with an auger beneath to meter the grain from the dryer. What is therefore needed is an adjustable discharge conveyor for a modular grain dryer.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
[0014] The following description of the preferred embodiments is merely exemplary in nature and is in no way intended to limit the invention, its application, or uses. Moreover, while the present invention is described in detail in reference to a grain dryer, it is envisioned that the present invention is not limited to a grain dryer but also may be used in any other application that requires a metering conveyor for granular particles.<br>
[0015] With initial reference to Figure 1, a grain dryer in accordance;. with the teachings of the present invention is shown and generally indicated by the reference numeral 10. Grain dryer 10 includes an outer housing 12 configured to allow air to pass therethrough, an inner housing 14 configure to allow air to pass therethrough, a fan 16, a heater 18, a control system 20, and a conveyor 30, Outer housing 12 is shown to include an uppef portion 32. and a lower portion 34 with a shell 36 extending therefrom. Inner housing 14 is shown in Figures 1 and 2 to include an upper portion 38 and a lower edge 40. Outer housing 12 and inner housing 14 define a column 42 that defines a grain flow path. Lower edge 40 of inner housing 14 and shell 36 define a discharge opening 44 extending along the length of inner housing 14.<br>
[0016] As presently preferred, grain dryer 10 is provided in a modular assembly wherein outer housing 12 and inner housing 14 are provided in about 2-foot sections. Each section added to a modular grain dryer 10 proportionally increases the volumetric capacHy of the dryer. Conveyor 30 is provided as a modular assembly wherein porjons can be added or removed to accommodate differing lengths of grain dryer !0 3;, discussed below. In this manner, grain dryer 10 provides a modular<br>
apparatus for drying grain that may be sized to accommodate various desired volumetric flow rates.<br>
[0017] With reference to Figures 2, 3, and 4, discharge conveyor 30 is shown to include a trough 46, and a discharge chute 48, Conveyor 30 further includes a drive mechanism, or chain, 100 including a plurality of links 102 engaging a first sprocket 104 and a second sprocket 106. Conveyor 30 is further shown to include a plurality of base assemblies 110. Base assemblies 110 include a carrier 114 coupled to chain 100 and a paddle 118. Each carrier 114 is shown to include two sides 116. As best seen in Figure 5, a scooper assembly 120 includes a base assembly 110, a scooper bracket 122 attached to each side 116, and a scooper panel 124. As seen in Figure 6, a blocker assembly 130 includes a base assembly 110, a blocker bracket 132 attached to each side 116, and a blocker panel 134. In the embodiment illustrated, carrier 114, scooper bracket 122 and blocker bracket 132 are constructed of 14 gauge galvanized steel, and paddle 118, scooper panel 124, and blocker panel 134 are constructed of 3/16 inch ultra high molecular weight (UHMW) polyethylene<br>
[0018] As best seen in Figures 3 and 4, shelf 36 includes cutouts 138 to allow grain to fall from the level of shelf 36 to the trough 46 As discussed below, the scooper brackets 122 and the scooper panels 124 direct grain from discharge opening 44 to cutouts 138.<br>
[0019] When assembled, conveyor 30 is shown in Figures 2 and 3 to include the chain 100 of links 102 that cycle around sprockets 104, 106. Because of the use of a continuous chain 100, the carrier 114 is carried in a first direction and then in a second direction which is generally opposite the first direction. At least a portion of the links 102 provide a locating position for carriers 114 to attach thereto. A carrier 114 is attached to a link 102 about every foot along the length of chain 100. Each carrier 114 is configured to be a portion of either a scooper assembly 120 or a blocker assembly 130. Thus provided, carriers 114 provide a selection of possible locating distances between scooper brackets 122 attached to different carriers 114. The carriers 114 that are not desired to act as scooper assemblies 120 are adapted to be blocker assemblies 130. !n this manner, conveyor 30 provides a metering conveyor system that will scoop a predetermined amount of grain from shelf<br>
36  that  is  generally  proportional  to  the   amount  of  selected   scooper assemblies.<br>
[0020] (n operation, blocker panels 134 prevent grain from moving from discharge opening 44 to cutouts 138. Scooper panels 124 and scooper brackets 122 peel a predetermined volume of grain from discharge opening 44 and direct the grain to cutouts 138. The volume of grain moved by one scooper pane! 124 depends upon variables such as the linear speed of conveyor 30, the height of grain on shelf 36, and the width of grain that the scooper panel 124 removes from shelf 36. The linear speed of conveyor 30 may be adjustable with control system 20. The height of grain removed from shelf 36 is determined by the height of discharge opening 44 and the proximity of scooper panel 124 to discharge opening 44, The width of grain removed from shelf 36 by one scooper panel 124 is the width of the grain that is pushed toward cutouts 138 by the scooper panel 124. As presently preferred, scooper panel 124 is positioned at an acute attack angle relative to the direction of chain 100 movement, and more preferably at an attack angle of less than about 45°.<br>
[0021] As best seen in Figure 2, conveyor 30 is configured such that scooper panels 124 divert grain from discharge opening 44 to trcugh 46 as carriers 114 cycle in a first direction, or away from discharge chute 48. Blocker panels 134 prevent grain from passing from discharge opening 44 to trough 46. In this manner, blocker assemblies 130 inhibit the flow of grain from shelf 36 to trough 46.<br>
[0022] As best seen in Figure 3, paddles 118 are configured to push grain through trough 46 as carriers 114 cycle in a second direction opposite the first direction, or toward discharge chute 48. As carriers 114 rotate about first sprocket 104, paddtes 118 push grain from trough 46 into discharge chute 48. In this manner, conveyor 30 is configured to cycle in a fixed path, or continuous loop, and to direct the rnetered grain from shelf 36, to trough 46, and to a discharge 48.<br>
[0023] When different sizes of dryers are provided, e.g. as a result of using more or fewer 2-foot grain dryer sections, the ratio of scooper assemblies to blocker assemblies may be changed to provide the vaiying desired volumetric flow rate. To accomplish this change, scooper brackets<br>
122 or blocker brackets 132 are detached from carriers 114 and the desired number of scooper brackets 122 or blocker brackets 132 and bbcker panels 134 are coupled to the carriers 114. As best seen in Figures 5 and 6, both scooper brackets 122 and biocker brackets 132 are removably attached to carriers 114 with fasteners 140. As presently preferred, fasteners 140 are stainless steel bolts having complementary nuts attached thereto.<br>
[0024] As presently preferred, carriers 114 are about one foot in length such that a carrier 114 is coupled to chain 100 about every 12 inches. A 20 foot grain dryer would include ten 2-foot sections of housing, 25 blocker assemblies 130, and 24 scooper assemblies 120. While Figures 2 and 3 depict the conveyor 30 with an approximate ratio of 2 blocker assemblies 130 to one scooper assembly 120, it is envisioned that this ratio can be any range of ratios required to accommodate a preselected volumetric flow rate. As will be appreciated, the speed of carriers 114 as they cycie through conveyor 30 can be altered to achieve a different grain flow rate. It is envisioned that a more consistent discharge rate is accomplished when the scooper assemblies 120 are evenly distributed along chain 100.<br>
[0025] The description of the invention is merely exemplary in nature and, thus, variations that do not depart from the gist of the invention are intended to be within the scope of the invention. Such variations are not to be regarded as a departure from the spirit and scope of the invention,<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
