5-SUBSTITUTED-ALKYLAMINOPYRAZOLE DERIVATIVES  AS   PESTICIDES<br>
The invention relates to the use for the control of pests (including insects, arachnids and helminths (including nematodes)) of 5-substituted-alkyiaminopyrazole derivatives, to novel compounds and compositions used therein, and to processes used for their preparation.<br>
The control of insects, arachnids and helminths with 1-arylpyrazole compounds has been described in, for example, patent publication numbers WO 93/06089, WO 94/21606, WO 87/03781, EP 02951.17, EP 659745, EP 679650, EP 201852 and U.S. 5,232,940. The control of parasites in animals with 1-arylpyrazoie compounds has also been described in, for example, patent publication numbers WO 00/35884, EP 0846686, WO 98/24769 and WO 97/28126.<br>
In addition, WO 02/066423 describes a process for preparing l-arylpyrazole compounds.<br>
However, the level of action and/or duration of action of these prior-art compounds is not entirely satisfactory in ail fields of application, in particular against certain organisms or when low concentrations are applied.<br>
Since modem pesticides must meet a wide range of demands, for example    . regarding level, duration and spectrum of action,-use spectrum, toxicity,* combination with other active substances, combination with formulation auxiliaries or synthesis, and since the occurrence of resistances is possible, the development of such substances can never be regarded as concluded, and there is constantly a high, demand for novel compounds which are advantageous over the known compounds, at least as far as some aspects are concerned.<br>
It was an object of the present invention to provide compounds which widen the spectrum of the pesticides in various aspects, specifically with regard to the control of parasites in animals.<br><br>
-The present invention provides a method of controlling parasites in or on an animal comprising administering to the animal a parasiticidally effective amount of a 5-substituted-alkylaminopyrazole derivative of formula (I):<br>

Collections of compounds of the formula (I) which can be synthesized by the above mentioned process may also be prepared in a parallel manner, and this may be<br><br>
effected manually or in a semiautomated or fully automated manner. In this.case, it is possible, for example, to automate the procedure of the reaction, work-up or purification of the products or of the intermediates. In total, this is to be understood \   as meaning a procedure as is described, for example, by S.H. DeWitt in "Annual Reports in Combinatorial Chemistry and Molecular Diversity: Automated Synthesis", Volume 1, Verlag Escom 1997, pages 69 to 77.<br>
A series of commercially available apparatuses as are offered by, for example, Stem Corporation, Woodrolfe Road, Tollesbury, Essex, CM9 8SE, England or H+P Labortechnik GmbH, Bruckmannring 28, 85764 Oberschieiftheim, Germany or Radleys, Shirehill, Saffron Walden, Essex, England, may be used for the parallel procedure of the reaction and work-up. For the parallel purification of compounds of the formula (I), or of intermediates obtained during the preparation, use may be made, inter alia, of chromatography apparatuses, for example those by ISCO, Inc., 4700 Superior Street, Lincoln, NE 68504, USA.<br>
The apparatuses mentioned lead to a modular procedure in which the individual process steps are automated, but manual operations must be performed between the process steps. This can be prevented by employing semi-integrated or fully integrated automation systems where the automation modules in question are operated by, for example, robots. Such automation systems can be obtained, for example, from Zymark Corporation, Zymark Center, Hopkinton, MA 01748, USA.<br>
In addition to what has been described here, compounds of the formula (l) may be prepared in part or fully by solid-phase-supported methods. For this purpose, individual intermediate steps or all intermediate steps of the synthesis or of a synthesis adapted to suit the procedure in question are bound to a synthetic resin.        ' Solid-phase-supported synthesis methods are described extensively in the specialist literature, for example Barry A. Bunin in "The Combinatorial Index", Academic Press,<br>
1998.<br>
The use of solid-phase-supported synthesis methods permits a series of protocols<br>
which are known from the literature and which, in turn, can be performed manually or<br><br>
in an automated manner. For example, the "tea-bag method" (Houghten, US 4,631,211; Houghten et al.f Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci, 1985, 82, 5131-5135), in which products by IRORi, 11149 North Torrey Pines Road, La Jolla, CA 92037, USA, are employed, may be semiautomated. The automation of solid-phase-supported para! syntheses is performed successfully, for example, by apparatuses by Argonaut Technologies, Inc., 887 Industrial Road, San Carlos, CA 94070, USA or MultiSynTech GmbH, Wullener Fe!d 4, 58454 Witten, Germany.<br>
The preparation of the processes described herein yields compounds of the formul; (I) in the form of substance collections which are termed libraries. The present invention also relates to libraries which comprise at least two compounds of the formula (I).<br>
Intermediates of formula (II) wherein L is chlorine, bromine or iodine may be prepared according to known procedures, for example as described in EP 0295117 by the diazotisation of the corresponding amine of formula (VIII), generally using ar alky! nitrite such as t-butyl nitrite, in the presence of a suitable halogenating agent, preferably bromoform, iodine or anhydrous cupric chloride, optionally in the present of a solvent such as acetonitrile or chloroform, at a temperature of from 0° to 100°C<br>
Some of the compounds of formula (IV) and (X) are included in the definition of<br>
formula (I) and may be prepared by the above-mentioned methods, whilst the other<br>
compounds of formula (IV) and (X) are known or may be prepared by known<br>
methods.<br>
Compounds of formula (XV) are novel and as such form a further feature of the<br>
invention.<br>
Compounds of formula (II), (III), (V), (VI), (VII), (VIII), (IX), (XI), (XII), (XIII) and (XIV]<br>

In a further aspect of the invention the compounds of formula (I) or salts or compositions thereof are used for the preparation of a veterinary medicament, preferably for the control of parasites, spezifically ecto and endo parasites, in and on animals.<br>
The compounds of the invention and methods of use thereof are of particular value in the control of arthropods or helminths which are injurious to, ,or spread or act as vectors of diseases domestic animals, for example those hereinbefore mentioned, and more'especially in the control of ticks, mites, lice, fleas, midges, orbiting, nuisance or myiasis flies. The compounds of the invention are particularly useful in<br><br>
controlling arthropods or helminths which are present inside domestic host animals or which feed in or on the skin or suck the blood of the animal, for which purpose they may be administered orally, parenteraily, percutaneously or topically.<br>
The compositions hereinafter described may, in general, be employed to animals infested by or exposed to infestation by arthropods or helminths, by parenteral, oral or topical application of compositions in which the active ingredient exhibits an immediate and/or prolonged action over a period of time against the arthropods or helminths, for example by incorporation in feed or suitable orally-ingestible pharmaceutical formulations, edible baits, salt licks, dietary supplements, pour-on formulations, sprays, baths, dips, showers, jets, dusts, greases, shampoos, creams, wax smears or livestock self-treatment systems;<br>
The compounds of formula (I) are particularly useful for the control of parasites a animals when applied orally, and in a further preferred aspect of the invention the compounds of formula (I) are used for the control of parasites of animals by oral application. The compounds of the formula (I) or salts thereof may be administered before, during or after meals. The compounds of the formula (1) or salts thereof may be mixed with a carrier and/or foodstuff.<br>
The compound of the formula (I) or salt thereof is administered orally in a dose to the animal in a dose range generally from 0.1 to 500 mg/kg of the compound of the. formula (J) or salt thereof per kilogram of animal body weight (mg/kg). The frequency of treatment of the animal, preferably the domestic animal to be treated by the compound of the formula (I) or salt thereof is generally from about once per week to about once per year, preferably from about once every two weeks to once every three months.<br>
The compounds of the invention may be administered-most advantageously with another parasiticidally effective material, such as an endoparasiticide, and/or an ectoparasiticide, and/or an endectoparasiticide. For example, such compounds include macrocycliq lactones such as avermectins or miibemycins e.g., ivermectin, pyratel or an insect growth regulator such as lufenuron or methoprene.<br><br>
According to a further feature of the present invention there is provided a method for the control of pests at a locus which comprises the application of an effective amount of a compound of formula (I).or a salt thereof. For this purpose, the said compound is normally used in the form of a pesticidal composition (i.e. in association with compatible diluents or carriers and/or surface active agents suitable for use in pesticidal compositions), for example as hereinafter described.<br>
One aspect of the present invention as defined above is a method for the control of pests at a locus. The locus includes, for example, the pest itself, the place (plant, field, forest, orchard, waterway, soil, plant product, or the like) where the pest resides or feeds, or a place susceptible to future infestation by the pest The compound of the invention may therefore be applied directly to the pest, to the place where the pest resides or feeds, or to the place susceptibleto future infestation by the pest. As is evident from the foregoing pesticidal uses, the present invention provides pesticidally active compounds and methods of use of said compounds for the control of a number of pest species which includes: arthropods, especially insects or mites, or plant nematodes. The compound of the invention may thus be advantageously employed in practical uses, for example, in veterinary medicine or livestock husbandry, in agricultural or horticultural crops, in forestry, or in public health. The compounds of the invention may be used for example in the following applications and on the following pests:<br>
In the field of veterinary medicine or livestock husbandry or in the maintenance of public health against arthropods which are parasitic internally or externally upon vertebrates, particularly warm-blooded vertebrates, for example domestic animals, e.g. cattle, sheep, goats, equines, swine, poultry, dogs or cats, for example Acarina, including ticks (e.g. sot-bodied ticks including Argasidae spp. e.g. Argas spp. and Omithodorus spp. (e.g. Ornithodorus moubata); hard-bodied ticks including Ixodidae spp., e.g. Boophilus spp. e.g. Boophilus microplus, Rhipicephalus spp. e.g. Rhipicephalus appendiculatus.and^Rhipicephalus sanguineus; mites (e.g. Damalinja spp.); fleas (e.g. Ctenocephalides spp. e.g. Ctenocephalides felis (cat flea) and Ctenocephalides cahis (dog flea)); lice e.g. Menopon spp.; Diptera (e.g. Aedes spp.; Anopheles spp., Musca spp., Hypoderma spp.); Hemiptera.; Dictyoptera (e.g.<br><br>
Periplaneta spp., Blatella spp.); Hymenoptera; for example against infections of the gastro-intestinal tract caused by parasitic nematode worms, for example members of the family Trichostrongylidae.<br>
For the control of .soil insects, such as corn rootworm, termites (especially for protection of structures), root maggots, wireworms, root weevils, stalkborers, cutworms, root aphids, or grubs. They may also be used to provide activity against plant pathogenic nematodes, such as root-knot, cyst, dagger, lesion, or stem or bulb nematodes, or against mites. For the control of soil pests, for example corn rootworm, the compounds are advantageously applied to or incorporated at an effective rate into the soil in which crops are planted or to be planted or to the seeds or growing plant roots.<br>
In the area of public health, the compounds are especially useful in the control of many insects, especially filth flies or other Dipteran pests, such as houseflies; stableflies, soldierflies, hornflies, deerflies, horseflies, midges, punkies, biackflies, or mosquitoes.<br>
In the protection of stored products, for example cereals, including grain or flour, groundnuts, animal feedstuffs, timber or household goods, e.g. carpets and textiles, compounds of the invention are useful against attack by arthropods, more especially beetles, including weevils, moths or mites, for example EEphestia spp. (flour moths), Anthrenus spp. (carpet beetles), Tribolium spp. (flour beetles), Sitophilus spp. (grain weevils) or Acarus spp. (mites).<br>
In the control of cockroaches, ants or termites or similar arthropod pests in Infested domestic or industrial premises or in the control of mosquito larvae in waterways, wells, reservoirs or other running or standing water.<br>
For the treatment of foundations, structures or soil in the prevention of the attack on<br>
building by termites, for example, Reticulitermes spp.,.Heterotermes spp.,	:<br>
Coptotermes spp.. ' In agriculture against adults, larvae and eggs of Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths), e.g. Heliothis spp. such as Heliothis virescens (tobacco budworm), Heliothis armigera and Heliothis zea. Against adults and larvae of Coleoptera (beetles) e.g. Anthonomus spp. e.g. grandis (cotton boll weevil), Leptinotarsa decemlineata (Colorado potato beetle), Diabrotica spp. (corn rootworms). Against Heteroptera<br><br>
(Hemiptera and Homoptera) e.g. Psyila spp., Bemisia spp., Triaieurodes spp., Aphis spp., Myzus sppM Megoura viciae, Phylloxera sppM Nephotettix spp. (rice leaf hoppers), Nilaparvata spp..<br>
Against Diptera e.g. Musca spp.. Against Thysanoptera such as Thrips tabaci. Against Orthoptera such as Locusta and Schistocerca spp., (locusts and crickets) e.g. Gryilus spp., and Acheta spp. for example, Blatta orientalis, Periplaneta americana, Blatella germanica, Locusta migratoria migratorioides, and Schistocerca gregaria. Against Collemboia e.g. Periplaneta spp. and Blatella spp. (roaches). Against arthropods of agricultural significance such as Acari (mites) e.g. Tetranychus spp., and Panonychus spp..<br>
Against nematodes which attack plants or trees of importance to agriculture, forestry or horticulture either directly or by spreading bacterial, viral, mycoplasma or fungal diseases of the plants. For example root-knot nematodes such as Meloidogyne spp. (e.g. M. incognita).<br>
In practical use for the control of arthropods, especially insects or mites, or nematode pests of plants, a method, for example, comprises applying to the plants or to the medium in which they grow an effective amount of a compound of the invention. For such a method, the compound of the invention is generally applied to the locus in which the arthropod or nematode infestation is to be controlled at an effective rate in the range of about 2g to about 1kg of the active compound per hectare of locus treated. Under ideal conditions, depending on the pest to be controlled, a lower rate may offer adequate protection, - On the other hand/adverse weather conditions, resistance of the pest or other factors may require that the active ingredient be used at higher rates. The optimum rate depends usually upon a number of factors, for example, the type of pest being controlled, the type or the growth stage of the infested plant, the row spacing or also the method of application. Preferably an effective rate range of the active compound is from about 10g/ha-to about 400g/ha, more preferably from about 50g/ha to about 200 g/ha. When a pest is soil-borne, the active'compound generally in a formulated composition, is distributed evenly over the area to be treated (ie, for example  . broadcast or band treatment) in any convenient manner and is applied at rates from<br><br>
about 10g/ha to about 400g ai/ha, preferably from about 50g/ha to about 200 g ai/ha. When applied as a root dip to seedlings or drip irrigation to plants the liquid solution or suspension contains from about 0.075 to about 1000 mg ai/I, preferably from about 25 to about 200 mg ai/l. Application may be made, if desired, to the field or crop-growing area generally or in close proximity to the seed or plant to be protected from attack. The compound of the invention can be washed into the soil by spraying with water over the area or can be left to the natural action of rainfall. During or after application, the formulated compound can, if desired, be distributed mechanically in the soil, for example by ploughing, disking, or use of drag chains. Application can be prior to planting, at planting, after planting but before sprouting has taken place, or after sprouting.<br>
The compound of the invention and methods of control of pests therewith are of particular value in the protection of field, forage, plantation, glasshouse, orchard or vineyard crops, of ornamentals, or of plantation or forest trees, for example: cereals (such as wheat or rice), cotton, vegetables (such as peppers), field crops (such as sugar beets, soybeans or oil seed rape), grassland or forage crops (such as maize or sorghum), orchards or groves (such as of stone or pit fruit or citrus), ornamental plants, flowers or vegetables or shrubs under glass or in gardens or parks, or forest trees (both deciduous and evergreen) in forests, plantations or nurseries. They are also valuable in the protection of timber (standing, felled, converted, stored or structural) from attack, for example, by sawflies or beetles or termites. . They have applications in the protection of stored products such as grains, fruits, nuts, spices or tobacco, whether whole, milled or compounded into products, from moth, beetle, mite or grain weevil attack. Also protected are stored animal products such as skins, hair, wool or feathers in natural or converted form (e.g. as carpets or textiles) from moth or beetle attack as well as stored meat, fish or grains from beetle,  : mite or fly attack.<br>
The compositions hereinafter described for application to growing crops or crop growing loci or as a seed dressing may, in general, alternatively be employed in the protection of stored products, household goods, property or areas of the general environment Suitable means of applying the compounds of the invention include:<br><br>
to growing crops as foliar sprays (for example as an in-furrow spray), dusts, ■ granules, fogs or foams or also as suspensions of finely divided or encapsulated compositions as soil or root treatments by liquid drenches, dusts," granules, smokes or foams; to seeds of crops via application as seed dressings by liquid slurries or dusts;<br>
to the environment in general or to specific locations where pests may lurk, including stored products, timber, household goods, or domestic or industrial premises, as sprays, fogs, dusts, smokes, wax-smears, lacquers, granules or baits, or in tricklefeeds to waterways, wells, reservoirs or other running or standing water.<br>
The compounds of the formula (I) can also be employed for controlling harmful organisms in crops of known genetically engineered .plants or genetically engineered plants yet to be developed. As a rule, the transgenic plants are distinguished by especially advantageous properties, for example by resistances to particular crop protection agents, resistances to plant diseases or pathogens of plant diseases, such as particular insects or microorganisms such as fungi, bacteria or viruses.    . Other particular properties concern, for example, the harvested material with regard to quantity, quality, storage properties, composition and specific constituents. Thus; transgenic plants are known where the starch content is increased, or the starch quality is altered, or where the harvested material has a different fatty acid composition.<br>
The use in economically important transgenic crops of useful plants and ornamentals is preferred, for example of cereals such as wheat, barley, rye, oats, millet, rice, cassava and maize or else crops of sugar beet, cotton, soya, oilseed rape, potatoes, tomatoes, peas and other types of vegetables.<br>
When used in transgenic crops, in particular those which have resistances to insects, effects are frequently observed, in addition to the effects against harmful organisms to be observed in other crops, which are specific for application in the transgenic crop in question, forexample an altered or specifically widened spectrum, of pests<br><br>
which can be controlled, or altered application rates which may be employed for application.<br>
The invention therefore also relates to the use of compounds of the formula (I) for controlling harmful organisms in transgenic crop plants.<br>
According to a further feature of the present invention there is provided a pesticidal composition comprising one or more compounds of the invention as defined above, in association with, and preferably homogeneously dispersed in one or more compatible pesticidally acceptable diluents or carriers and/or surface active agents [i.e. diluents or carriers and/or surface active agents of the type generally accepted in the art as being suitable for use in pesticidal compositions and which are compatible with compounds of the invention].<br>
In practice, the compounds of the invention most frequently form parts of compositions. These compositions can be employed to control arthropods, especially insects, or plant nematodes or mites. The compositions may be of any type known in the art suitable for application to the desired pest in any premises or indoor or outdoor area. These compositions contain at least one compound of the invention as the active ingredient in combination or association with one or more other compatible components which are for example, solid or liquid carriers or diluents, adjuvants, surface-active-agents, or the like appropriate for the intended use and which are agronomically or medicinally acceptable. These compositions, which may be prepared by any manner known in the art, likewise form a part of this invention.<br>
The compounds of the invention, in their commercially available formulations and in the use forms prepared from these formulations may be present in mixtures with other active substances such as insecticides, attractants, sterilants, acaricides, nematicides, fungicides, growth regulatory substances or herbicides.<br>

The abovementioned components for combinations are known active substances, many of which are described in Ch.R Worthing, SJB. Walker, The Pesticide Manual, 12th Edition, British Crop Protection Council, Farnham 2000.<br>
The effective use doses of the compounds employed in the invention can vary within wide limits, particularly depending on the nature of the pest to be eliminated or degree of infestation, for example, of crops with these pests. In general, the compositions according to the invention usually contain about 0.05 to about 95% (by weight) of one or more active ingredients according to the invention, about 1 to about 95% of one or more solid or liquid carriers and, optionally, about 0.1 to about 50% of one or more other compatible components, such as surface-active agents or the like. In the present account, the term "carrier" denotes an organic or inorganic ingredient, natural or synthetic, with which the active ingredient is combined to facilitate its application, for example, to the plant, to seeds or to the soil. This carrier is therefore generally inert and it must be acceptable (for example, agronomically acceptable, particularly to the treated plant).<br>
The carrier may be a solid, for example, clays, natural or synthetic silicates, silica, resins, waxes, solid fertilizers (for example ammonium salts), ground natural minerals, such as kaolins, clays, talc, chalk, quartz, attapulgite, montmorillonite, bentonite or diatomaceous earth, or ground synthetic minerals, such as silica, h alumina, or silicates especially aluminium or magnesium silicates. As solid carriers for granules the following are suitable: crushed or fractionated natural rocks such as calcite, marble, pumice, sepiolite and dolomite; synthetic granules of inorganic or<br><br>
organic meals; granules of organic material such as sawdust, coconut shells, corn cobs, corn husks or tobacco stalks; kieselguhr, tricalcium phosphate, powdered cork, or absorbent carbon black; water soluble polymers, resins, waxes; or solid fertilizers. Such solid compositions may, if desired, contain one or more compatible wetting,, dispersing, emulsifying or colouring agents which, when solid, may also serve as a diluent<br>
The carrier may also be liquid, for example: water; alcohols, particularly butanol or<br>
glycol, as well as their ethers or esters, particularly methylglyco! acetate; ketones,<br>
particularly acetone, cyclohexanone, methylethyl ketone, methylisobutylketone, or<br>
isophorone; petroleum fractions such as paraffinic or aromatic hydrocarbons,<br>
. particularly xylenes or alkyl naphthalenes; mineral or vegetable oils; aliphatic<br>
chlorinated hydrocarbons, particularly trichloroethane or methylene chloride;<br>
aromatic chlorinated hydrocarbons, particularly chlorobenzenes; water-soluble or<br>
strongly polar solvents such as dimethylformamide, dimethyl sulphoxide, or N-<br>
methylpyrrolidone; liquefied gases; or the like or a mixture thereof.<br>
The surface-active agent may be an emulsifying agent, dispersing agent or wetting<br>
agent of the ionic or non-ionic type or a mixture of such surface-active agents.<br>
Amongst these are e.g., salts of polyacrylic acids, salts of lignosulphonic acids, salts<br>
of phenolsulphonic or naphthalenesulphonic acids, polycondensates of ethylene<br>
oxide with fatty alcohols or fatty acids or fatty esters or fatty amines, substituted<br>
phenols (particularly alkylphenols or arylphenols), salts of sulphosuccinic acid esters,<br>
taurine derivatives (particularly alkyltaurates), phosphoric esters of alcohols or of .<br>
polycondensates of ethylene oxide with phenols, esters of fatty acids with polyols, or<br>
sulphate, sulphonate or phosphate functional derivatives of the above compounds.<br>
The presence of at least one surface-active agent is generally essential when the<br>
active ingredient and/or the inert carrier are only slightly water soluble or are not	,<br>
water soluble and the carrier agent of the composition, for application is water. Compositions of the invention may further contain other additives such as adhesives or colorants. Adhesives such as carboxymethylcellulose or natural or synthetic polymers in the form of powders, granules or lattices, such as arabic gum, polyvinyl alcohol or polyvinyl acetate, natural phospholipids, such as cephalins or lecithins, or synthetic phospholipids can be used in the formulations.  It is possible to use<br><br>
colorants such as inorganic pigments, for example: iron oxides, titanium oxides or Prussian Blue; organic dyestuffs, such as alizarin dyestuffs, azo dyestuffs or metal phthalocyanine dyestuffs; or trace nutrients such as salts of iron, manganese, boron, copper, cobalt, molybdenum or zinc.<br>
For their agricultural application, the compounds of the invention are therefore generally in the form of compositions, which are in various solid or liquid forms. Solid forms of compositions which can be used are dusting powders (with a content of the compound of the invention, ranging up to 80%), wettable powders or granules (including water dispersible granules), particularly those obtained by extrusion, compacting, impregnation of a granular carrier, or granulation starting from a powder (the content of the compound of the invention, in these wettable powders or granules being between about 0.5 and about 80%). Solid homogenous or heterogenous compositions containing one or more compounds of the invention, for example granules, pellets, briquettes or capsules, may be used to treat standing or running water over a period of time. A similar effect may be achieved using trickle or intermittent feeds of water dispersible concentrates as described herein. Liquid compositions, for example, include aqueous or non-aqueous solutions or suspensions (such as emulsifiable concentrates, emulsions, flowables, dispersions, or solutions) or aerosols. Liquid compositions also include, in particular, emulsifiable concentrates, dispersions, emulsions, flowables, aerosols, wettable powders (or powder for spraying), dry flowables or pastes as forms of compositions which are liquid or intended to form liquid compositions when applied, for example as aqueous sprays (including low and ultra-low volume) or as fogs or aerosols. Liquid compositions, for example, in the form of emulsifiable or soluble concentrates most frequently comprise about 5 to about 80% by weight of the active ingredient, while the emulsions or solutions which are ready for application contain, in their case, about 0.01to about 20% of the active ingredient Besides the solvent, the emulsifiable or soluble concentrates may contain, when required, about 2 to about 50% of suitable additives, such as stabilizers, surface-active agents, penetrating agents, corrosion inhibitors, colorants or adhesives. Emulsions of any required concentration, which are particularly suitable for application, for example, to- plants, may be obtained from these concentrates by dilution with water. These<br><br>
compositions are included within the scope of the compositions which may be employed in the present invention. The emulsions may be in the form of water-in-c or oil-in-water type and they may have a thick consistency.<br>
The liquid compositions of this invention may, in addition to normal agricultural use applications be used for example to treat substrates or sites infested or liable to infestation by arthropods (or other pests controlled by compounds of this invention^ including, premises, outdoor or indoor storage or processing areas, containers or equipment or standing or running water.<br>
All these aqueous dispersions or emulsions or spraying mixtures can be applied, fc example, to crops by any suitable means, chiefly by spraying, at rates which are generally of the order of about 100 to about 1,200 liters of spraying mixture per hectare, but may be higher or lower (eg. low or ultra-low volume) depending upon the need or application technique. The compound or compositions according to th
The concentrated suspensions, which can be applied by spraying, are prepared so as to produce a stable fluid product which does not settle (fine grinding) and usually contain from about 10 to about 75% by weight of active ingredient, from about 0.5 to about 30% of surface-active agents, from about 0,1 to about 10% of thixotropic agents, from about 0 to about 30% of suitable additives, such as anti-foaming agents, corrosion inhibitors, stabilizers, penetrating agents, adhesives and, as the carrier, water or an organic liquid in which the active ingredient is poorly soluble or insoluble Some organic solids or inorganic salts may be dissolved in the carrier to help prevent settling or as antifreezes for water.<br>
The wettable powers (or powder for spraying) are usually prepared so that they contain from about 10 to about 80% by weight of active ingredient, from about 20 to about 90% of a solid carrier, from about 0 to about 5% of a wetting agent, from about 3 to about 10% of a dispersing agent and, when necessary, from about 0 to about<br><br>
80% of one or more stabilizers and/or other additives, such as penetrating agents, adhesives, anti-caking agents, colorants, or the like. To obtain these wettable powders, the active ingredient is thoroughly mixed in a suitable blender with additional substances which may be impregnated on the porous filler and is ground using a mill or other suitable grinder. This produces wettable powders, the wettability and the suspendability of which are advantageous. They may be suspended in water to give any desired concentration and this suspension can be employed very advantageously in particular for application to plant foliage. The "water dispersibie granules (WG)" (granules which are readily dispersible in water) have compositions which are substantially close to that of the wettable powders. They may be prepared by granulation of formulations described for the wettable powders, either by a wet route (contacting finely divided active ingredient with the inert filler and a little water, e.g. 1 to 20% by weight, or with an aqueous solution of a dispersing agent or binder, followed by drying and screening), or by a dry route (compacting followed by grinding and screening). The rates and concentrations of the formulated compositions may vary according to the method of application or the nature of the compositions or use thereof. Generally speaking, the compositions for application to control arthropod or plant nematode pests usually contain from about 0.00001% to about 95%, more particularly from about 0.0005% to about 50% by weight of one or more compounds of the invention, or of total active ingredients (that is to say the compounds of the invention, together with other substances toxic to arthropods or plant nematodes, synergists, trace elements or stabilizers). The actual compositions employed and their.rate of application will be selected to achieve the desired effect(s) by the farmer, livestock producer, medical or veterinary practitioner, pest control operator or other person skilled in the art.<br>
Solid or liquid compositions for application topically to animals, timber, stored products or household goods usually contain from about 0.00005% to about 90%, more particularly from about 0.001% to about 10%, by weight of one or more .   compounds of the invention. For administration to animals orally orparenterally, including percutaneously solid or liquid compositions, these normally contain from about 0.1 % to about 90% by weight of one or more compounds of the invention.<br><br>
Medicated feedstuffs normally contain from about 0.001% to about 3% by weight of one or more compounds of the invention. Concentrates or supplements for mixing with feedstuffs normally contain from about 5% to about 90%, preferably from about 5% to about 50%, by weight of one or more compounds of the invention. Mineral salt licks normally contain from about 0.1 % to about 10% by weight of one or more compounds of formula (I) or pesticidally acceptable salts thereof. Dusts or liquid compositions for application to livestock, goods, premises or outdoor areas may contain from about 0.0001% to about 15%, more especially from about 0.005% to about 2.0%, by weight, of one or more compounds of the invention. Suitable concentrations in treated waters are between about 0.0001 ppm and about 20 ppm, more particularly about 0.001 ppm to about 5.0 ppm. of one or more compounds of the invention, and may be used therapeutically in fish farming with appropriate exposure times. Edible baits may contain from about 0.01% to about 5%, preferably from about 0.01% to about 1.0%, by weight, of one or more compounds of the invention.<br>
When administered to vertebrates parenterally, orally or by percutaneous or other means, the dosage of compounds of the invention, will depend upon the species, • age, or health of the vertebrate and upon the nature and degree of its actual or potential infestation by arthropod or helminth pests. A single dose of about 0.1 to about 100 mg, preferably about 2.0 to about 20.0 mg, per kg body weight of the animal or doses of about 0.01 to about 20.0 mg, preferably about 0.1 to about 5.0 mg, per kg body weight of the animal per day, for sustained medication, are generally suitable by oral or parenteral administration. By use of sustained release formulations or devices, the daily doses required over a period of months may be combined and administered to animals on a single occasion.<br>

METHODS OF PESTICIDAL USE<br>
The following representative test procedures, using compounds of the invention, were conducted to determine the parasiticidal and pesticidal activity of compounds of the invention.<br>
METHOD A: Screening method to test systemicity of compounds against Ctenocephalides felis (Cat flea)<br>
A test container was filled with 10 adults of Ctenocephalides felis. A glass cylinder was closed on one end with parafiim and placed on top of the test container. The test compound solution was then pipetted into bovine blood and added to the glass cylinder. The treated Ctenocephalides felis were.held in this artificial dog test (blood 37 °C, 40-60 % relative humidity; Ctenocephalides felis 20-22°C, 40-60 % relative humidity) and assessment performed at 24 and 48 hours after application. Compound numbers 1-2, 1-8, 1-9, 1-10, 1-14, 1-15, 1-16, 1-17, 1-19, 1-34, 1-35, 1-36, 1-37, 1-38, 1-39, 1-40, 2-2, 2-8, 2-9, 2-10, 2-14, 2-16, 2-17, 2-19, 2-35, 2-36 and 3-19 gave at least 90% control of Ctenocephalides felis at a test concentration of 5ppm or less.<br>
METHOD B: Diabrotica undecimpunctata (southern corn rootworm) screen Two days before application, seeds of maize were soaked in water under warm conditions to elicit fast germination. One day before application, eggs of Diabrotica undecimpunctata were transferred to one half of a Japanese filter paper placed in a plastic petri dish. Afterwards, a sprouted maize seed was placed on a moistened pad beside the filter paper. Three drops of 200 microlitres of test conripound solution were carefully pipetted onto the egg. The remainder of the solution was placed on the maize and then the Petri dish was closed. The treated eggs in the Petri dishes were held in a climate chamber for 6 days. The compound efficacy (percentage of dead " eggs and/or larvae in comparison to untreated control) was assessed 6 days after application using a binocular microscope.<br>
Compound numbers 1-17, 1-19,1-35, 1-36, 1-38,1-39, 2-9, 2-19, 2-35 and 2-36 gave at least 90% control of Diabrotica undecimpunctata at a test concentration of 10ppm.<br><br>
METHOD C: Nephotettix Cinciceps (rice Ieafhopper) screen<br>
The leaves of 12 rice plants having a stem length of 8 cm v/ere dipped for 5 seconds<br>
into an aqueous solution of the formulated test compound. After the solution had run<br>
off, the rice plants treated in this manner were placed in a Petri dish and populated<br>
with about 20 larvae (L3 stage) of Nephotettix cincticeps. The Petri dish was closed<br>
and then stored in a climate chamber (16 hours of light/day, 25°C, 40-60% relative<br>

Description<br>
5-SUBSTITUTED-ALKYLAMINOPYRAZOLE DERIVATIVES  AS   PESTICIDES<br>
The invention relates to the use for the control of pests (including insects, arachnids and helminths (including nematodes)) of 5-substituted-alkyiaminopyrazole derivatives, to novel compounds and compositions used therein, and to processes used for their preparation.<br>
The control of insects, arachnids and helminths with 1-arylpyrazole compounds has been described in, for example, patent publication numbers WO 93/06089, WO 94/21606, WO 87/03781, EP 02951.17, EP 659745, EP 679650, EP 201852 and U.S. 5,232,940. The control of parasites in animals with 1-arylpyrazoie compounds has also been described in, for example, patent publication numbers WO 00/35884, EP 0846686, WO 98/24769 and WO 97/28126.<br>
In addition, WO 02/066423 describes a process for preparing l-arylpyrazole compounds.<br>
However, the level of action and/or duration of action of these prior-art compounds is not entirely satisfactory in ail fields of application, in particular against certain organisms or when low concentrations are applied.<br>
Since modem pesticides must meet a wide range of demands, for example    . regarding level, duration and spectrum of action,-use spectrum, toxicity,* combination with other active substances, combination with formulation auxiliaries or synthesis, and since the occurrence of resistances is possible, the development of such substances can never be regarded as concluded, and there is constantly a high, demand for novel compounds which are advantageous over the known compounds, at least as far as some aspects are concerned.<br>
It was an object of the present invention to provide compounds which widen the spectrum of the pesticides in various aspects, specifically with regard to the control of parasites in animals.<br><br>
-The present invention provides a method of controlling parasites in or on an animal comprising administering to the animal a parasiticidally effective amount of a 5-substituted-alkylaminopyrazole derivative of formula (I):<br>

Collections of compounds of the formula (I) which can be synthesized by the above mentioned process may also be prepared in a parallel manner, and this may be<br><br>
effected manually or in a semiautomated or fully automated manner. In this.case, it is possible, for example, to automate the procedure of the reaction, work-up or purification of the products or of the intermediates. In total, this is to be understood \   as meaning a procedure as is described, for example, by S.H. DeWitt in "Annual Reports in Combinatorial Chemistry and Molecular Diversity: Automated Synthesis", Volume 1, Verlag Escom 1997, pages 69 to 77.<br>
A series of commercially available apparatuses as are offered by, for example, Stem Corporation, Woodrolfe Road, Tollesbury, Essex, CM9 8SE, England or H+P Labortechnik GmbH, Bruckmannring 28, 85764 Oberschieiftheim, Germany or Radleys, Shirehill, Saffron Walden, Essex, England, may be used for the parallel procedure of the reaction and work-up. For the parallel purification of compounds of the formula (I), or of intermediates obtained during the preparation, use may be made, inter alia, of chromatography apparatuses, for example those by ISCO, Inc., 4700 Superior Street, Lincoln, NE 68504, USA.<br>
The apparatuses mentioned lead to a modular procedure in which the individual process steps are automated, but manual operations must be performed between the process steps. This can be prevented by employing semi-integrated or fully integrated automation systems where the automation modules in question are operated by, for example, robots. Such automation systems can be obtained, for example, from Zymark Corporation, Zymark Center, Hopkinton, MA 01748, USA.<br>
In addition to what has been described here, compounds of the formula (l) may be prepared in part or fully by solid-phase-supported methods. For this purpose, individual intermediate steps or all intermediate steps of the synthesis or of a synthesis adapted to suit the procedure in question are bound to a synthetic resin.        ' Solid-phase-supported synthesis methods are described extensively in the specialist literature, for example Barry A. Bunin in "The Combinatorial Index", Academic Press,<br>
1998.<br>
The use of solid-phase-supported synthesis methods permits a series of protocols<br>
which are known from the literature and which, in turn, can be performed manually or<br><br>
in an automated manner. For example, the "tea-bag method" (Houghten, US 4,631,211; Houghten et al.f Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci, 1985, 82, 5131-5135), in which products by IRORi, 11149 North Torrey Pines Road, La Jolla, CA 92037, USA, are employed, may be semiautomated. The automation of solid-phase-supported para! syntheses is performed successfully, for example, by apparatuses by Argonaut Technologies, Inc., 887 Industrial Road, San Carlos, CA 94070, USA or MultiSynTech GmbH, Wullener Fe!d 4, 58454 Witten, Germany.<br>
The preparation of the processes described herein yields compounds of the formul; (I) in the form of substance collections which are termed libraries. The present invention also relates to libraries which comprise at least two compounds of the formula (I).<br>
Intermediates of formula (II) wherein L is chlorine, bromine or iodine may be prepared according to known procedures, for example as described in EP 0295117 by the diazotisation of the corresponding amine of formula (VIII), generally using ar alky! nitrite such as t-butyl nitrite, in the presence of a suitable halogenating agent, preferably bromoform, iodine or anhydrous cupric chloride, optionally in the present of a solvent such as acetonitrile or chloroform, at a temperature of from 0° to 100°C<br>
Some of the compounds of formula (IV) and (X) are included in the definition of<br>
formula (I) and may be prepared by the above-mentioned methods, whilst the other<br>
compounds of formula (IV) and (X) are known or may be prepared by known<br>
methods.<br>
Compounds of formula (XV) are novel and as such form a further feature of the<br>
invention.<br>
Compounds of formula (II), (III), (V), (VI), (VII), (VIII), (IX), (XI), (XII), (XIII) and (XIV]<br>
are known or may be prepared by known methods.   .<br>

The compounds of the invention and methods of use thereof are of particular value in the control of arthropods or helminths which are injurious to, ,or spread or act as vectors of diseases domestic animals, for example those hereinbefore mentioned, and more'especially in the control of ticks, mites, lice, fleas, midges, orbiting, nuisance or myiasis flies. The compounds of the invention are particularly useful in<br><br>
controlling arthropods or helminths which are present inside domestic host animals or which feed in or on the skin or suck the blood of the animal, for which purpose they may be administered orally, parenteraily, percutaneously or topically.<br>
The compositions hereinafter described may, in general, be employed to animals infested by or exposed to infestation by arthropods or helminths, by parenteral, oral or topical application of compositions in which the active ingredient exhibits an immediate and/or prolonged action over a period of time against the arthropods or helminths, for example by incorporation in feed or suitable orally-ingestible pharmaceutical formulations, edible baits, salt licks, dietary supplements, pour-on formulations, sprays, baths, dips, showers, jets, dusts, greases, shampoos, creams, wax smears or livestock self-treatment systems;<br>
The compounds of formula (I) are particularly useful for the control of parasites a animals when applied orally, and in a further preferred aspect of the invention the compounds of formula (I) are used for the control of parasites of animals by oral application. The compounds of the formula (I) or salts thereof may be administered before, during or after meals. The compounds of the formula (1) or salts thereof may be mixed with a carrier and/or foodstuff.<br>
The compound of the formula (I) or salt thereof is administered orally in a dose to the animal in a dose range generally from 0.1 to 500 mg/kg of the compound of the. formula (J) or salt thereof per kilogram of animal body weight (mg/kg). The frequency of treatment of the animal, preferably the domestic animal to be treated by the compound of the formula (I) or salt thereof is generally from about once per week to about once per year, preferably from about once every two weeks to once every three months.<br>
The compounds of the invention may be administered-most advantageously with another parasiticidally effective material, such as an endoparasiticide, and/or an ectoparasiticide, and/or an endectoparasiticide. For example, such compounds include macrocycliq lactones such as avermectins or miibemycins e.g., ivermectin, pyratel or an insect growth regulator such as lufenuron or methoprene.<br><br>
According to a further feature of the present invention there is provided a method for the control of pests at a locus which comprises the application of an effective amount of a compound of formula (I).or a salt thereof. For this purpose, the said compound is normally used in the form of a pesticidal composition (i.e. in association with compatible diluents or carriers and/or surface active agents suitable for use in pesticidal compositions), for example as hereinafter described.<br>
One aspect of the present invention as defined above is a method for the control of pests at a locus. The locus includes, for example, the pest itself, the place (plant, field, forest, orchard, waterway, soil, plant product, or the like) where the pest resides or feeds, or a place susceptible to future infestation by the pest The compound of the invention may therefore be applied directly to the pest, to the place where the pest resides or feeds, or to the place susceptibleto future infestation by the pest. As is evident from the foregoing pesticidal uses, the present invention provides pesticidally active compounds and methods of use of said compounds for the control of a number of pest species which includes: arthropods, especially insects or mites, or plant nematodes. The compound of the invention may thus be advantageously employed in practical uses, for example, in veterinary medicine or livestock husbandry, in agricultural or horticultural crops, in forestry, or in public health. The compounds of the invention may be used for example in the following applications and on the following pests:<br>
In the field of veterinary medicine or livestock husbandry or in the maintenance of public health against arthropods which are parasitic internally or externally upon vertebrates, particularly warm-blooded vertebrates, for example domestic animals, e.g. cattle, sheep, goats, equines, swine, poultry, dogs or cats, for example Acarina, including ticks (e.g. sot-bodied ticks including Argasidae spp. e.g. Argas spp. and Omithodorus spp. (e.g. Ornithodorus moubata); hard-bodied ticks including Ixodidae spp., e.g. Boophilus spp. e.g. Boophilus microplus, Rhipicephalus spp. e.g. Rhipicephalus appendiculatus.and^Rhipicephalus sanguineus; mites (e.g. Damalinja spp.); fleas (e.g. Ctenocephalides spp. e.g. Ctenocephalides felis (cat flea) and Ctenocephalides cahis (dog flea)); lice e.g. Menopon spp.; Diptera (e.g. Aedes spp.; Anopheles spp., Musca spp., Hypoderma spp.); Hemiptera.; Dictyoptera (e.g.<br><br>
Periplaneta spp., Blatella spp.); Hymenoptera; for example against infections of the gastro-intestinal tract caused by parasitic nematode worms, for example members of the family Trichostrongylidae.<br>
For the control of .soil insects, such as corn rootworm, termites (especially for protection of structures), root maggots, wireworms, root weevils, stalkborers, cutworms, root aphids, or grubs. They may also be used to provide activity against plant pathogenic nematodes, such as root-knot, cyst, dagger, lesion, or stem or bulb nematodes, or against mites. For the control of soil pests, for example corn rootworm, the compounds are advantageously applied to or incorporated at an effective rate into the soil in which crops are planted or to be planted or to the seeds or growing plant roots.<br>
In the area of public health, the compounds are especially useful in the control of many insects, especially filth flies or other Dipteran pests, such as houseflies; stableflies, soldierflies, hornflies, deerflies, horseflies, midges, punkies, biackflies, or mosquitoes.<br>
In the protection of stored products, for example cereals, including grain or flour, groundnuts, animal feedstuffs, timber or household goods, e.g. carpets and textiles, compounds of the invention are useful against attack by arthropods, more especially beetles, including weevils, moths or mites, for example EEphestia spp. (flour moths), Anthrenus spp. (carpet beetles), Tribolium spp. (flour beetles), Sitophilus spp. (grain weevils) or Acarus spp. (mites).<br>
In the control of cockroaches, ants or termites or similar arthropod pests in Infested domestic or industrial premises or in the control of mosquito larvae in waterways, wells, reservoirs or other running or standing water.<br>
For the treatment of foundations, structures or soil in the prevention of the attack on<br>
building by termites, for example, Reticulitermes spp.,.Heterotermes spp.,	:<br>
Coptotermes spp.. ' In agriculture against adults, larvae and eggs of Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths), e.g. Heliothis spp. such as Heliothis virescens (tobacco budworm), Heliothis armigera and Heliothis zea. Against adults and larvae of Coleoptera (beetles) e.g. Anthonomus spp. e.g. grandis (cotton boll weevil), Leptinotarsa decemlineata (Colorado potato beetle), Diabrotica spp. (corn rootworms). Against Heteroptera<br><br>
(Hemiptera and Homoptera) e.g. Psyila spp., Bemisia spp., Triaieurodes spp., Aphis spp., Myzus sppM Megoura viciae, Phylloxera sppM Nephotettix spp. (rice leaf hoppers), Nilaparvata spp..<br>
Against Diptera e.g. Musca spp.. Against Thysanoptera such as Thrips tabaci. Against Orthoptera such as Locusta and Schistocerca spp., (locusts and crickets) e.g. Gryilus spp., and Acheta spp. for example, Blatta orientalis, Periplaneta americana, Blatella germanica, Locusta migratoria migratorioides, and Schistocerca gregaria. Against Collemboia e.g. Periplaneta spp. and Blatella spp. (roaches). Against arthropods of agricultural significance such as Acari (mites) e.g. Tetranychus spp., and Panonychus spp..<br>
Against nematodes which attack plants or trees of importance to agriculture, forestry or horticulture either directly or by spreading bacterial, viral, mycoplasma or fungal diseases of the plants. For example root-knot nematodes such as Meloidogyne spp. (e.g. M. incognita).<br>
In practical use for the control of arthropods, especially insects or mites, or nematode pests of plants, a method, for example, comprises applying to the plants or to the medium in which they grow an effective amount of a compound of the invention. For such a method, the compound of the invention is generally applied to the locus in which the arthropod or nematode infestation is to be controlled at an effective rate in the range of about 2g to about 1kg of the active compound per hectare of locus treated. Under ideal conditions, depending on the pest to be controlled, a lower rate may offer adequate protection, - On the other hand/adverse weather conditions, resistance of the pest or other factors may require that the active ingredient be used at higher rates. The optimum rate depends usually upon a number of factors, for example, the type of pest being controlled, the type or the growth stage of the infested plant, the row spacing or also the method of application. Preferably an effective rate range of the active compound is from about 10g/ha-to about 400g/ha, more preferably from about 50g/ha to about 200 g/ha. When a pest is soil-borne, the active'compound generally in a formulated composition, is distributed evenly over the area to be treated (ie, for example  . broadcast or band treatment) in any convenient manner and is applied at rates from<br><br>
about 10g/ha to about 400g ai/ha, preferably from about 50g/ha to about 200 g ai/ha. When applied as a root dip to seedlings or drip irrigation to plants the liquid solution or suspension contains from about 0.075 to about 1000 mg ai/I, preferably from about 25 to about 200 mg ai/l. Application may be made, if desired, to the field or crop-growing area generally or in close proximity to the seed or plant to be protected from attack. The compound of the invention can be washed into the soil by spraying with water over the area or can be left to the natural action of rainfall. During or after application, the formulated compound can, if desired, be distributed mechanically in the soil, for example by ploughing, disking, or use of drag chains. Application can be prior to planting, at planting, after planting but before sprouting has taken place, or after sprouting.<br>
The compound of the invention and methods of control of pests therewith are of particular value in the protection of field, forage, plantation, glasshouse, orchard or vineyard crops, of ornamentals, or of plantation or forest trees, for example: cereals (such as wheat or rice), cotton, vegetables (such as peppers), field crops (such as sugar beets, soybeans or oil seed rape), grassland or forage crops (such as maize or sorghum), orchards or groves (such as of stone or pit fruit or citrus), ornamental plants, flowers or vegetables or shrubs under glass or in gardens or parks, or forest trees (both deciduous and evergreen) in forests, plantations or nurseries. They are also valuable in the protection of timber (standing, felled, converted, stored or structural) from attack, for example, by sawflies or beetles or termites. . They have applications in the protection of stored products such as grains, fruits, nuts, spices or tobacco, whether whole, milled or compounded into products, from moth, beetle, mite or grain weevil attack. Also protected are stored animal products such as skins, hair, wool or feathers in natural or converted form (e.g. as carpets or textiles) from moth or beetle attack as well as stored meat, fish or grains from beetle,  : mite or fly attack.<br>
The compositions hereinafter described for application to growing crops or crop growing loci or as a seed dressing may, in general, alternatively be employed in the protection of stored products, household goods, property or areas of the general environment Suitable means of applying the compounds of the invention include:<br><br>
to growing crops as foliar sprays (for example as an in-furrow spray), dusts, ■ granules, fogs or foams or also as suspensions of finely divided or encapsulated compositions as soil or root treatments by liquid drenches, dusts," granules, smokes or foams; to seeds of crops via application as seed dressings by liquid slurries or dusts;<br>
to the environment in general or to specific locations where pests may lurk, including stored products, timber, household goods, or domestic or industrial premises, as sprays, fogs, dusts, smokes, wax-smears, lacquers, granules or baits, or in tricklefeeds to waterways, wells, reservoirs or other running or standing water.<br>
The compounds of the formula (I) can also be employed for controlling harmful organisms in crops of known genetically engineered .plants or genetically engineered plants yet to be developed. As a rule, the transgenic plants are distinguished by especially advantageous properties, for example by resistances to particular crop protection agents, resistances to plant diseases or pathogens of plant diseases, such as particular insects or microorganisms such as fungi, bacteria or viruses.    . Other particular properties concern, for example, the harvested material with regard to quantity, quality, storage properties, composition and specific constituents. Thus; transgenic plants are known where the starch content is increased, or the starch quality is altered, or where the harvested material has a different fatty acid composition.<br>
The use in economically important transgenic crops of useful plants and ornamentals is preferred, for example of cereals such as wheat, barley, rye, oats, millet, rice, cassava and maize or else crops of sugar beet, cotton, soya, oilseed rape, potatoes, tomatoes, peas and other types of vegetables.<br>
When used in transgenic crops, in particular those which have resistances to insects, effects are frequently observed, in addition to the effects against harmful organisms to be observed in other crops, which are specific for application in the transgenic crop in question, forexample an altered or specifically widened spectrum, of pests<br><br>
which can be controlled, or altered application rates which may be employed for application.<br>
The invention therefore also relates to the use of compounds of the formula (I) for controlling harmful organisms in transgenic crop plants.<br>
According to a further feature of the present invention there is provided a pesticidal composition comprising one or more compounds of the invention as defined above, in association with, and preferably homogeneously dispersed in one or more compatible pesticidally acceptable diluents or carriers and/or surface active agents [i.e. diluents or carriers and/or surface active agents of the type generally accepted in the art as being suitable for use in pesticidal compositions and which are compatible with compounds of the invention].<br>
In practice, the compounds of the invention most frequently form parts of compositions. These compositions can be employed to control arthropods, especially insects, or plant nematodes or mites. The compositions may be of any type known in the art suitable for application to the desired pest in any premises or indoor or outdoor area. These compositions contain at least one compound of the invention as the active ingredient in combination or association with one or more other compatible components which are for example, solid or liquid carriers or diluents, adjuvants, surface-active-agents, or the like appropriate for the intended use and which are agronomically or medicinally acceptable. These compositions, which may be prepared by any manner known in the art, likewise form a part of this invention.<br>
The compounds of the invention, in their commercially available formulations and in the use forms prepared from these formulations may be present in mixtures with other active substances such as insecticides, attractants, sterilants, acaricides, nematicides, fungicides, growth regulatory substances or herbicides.<br>
The pesticides include, for example, phosphoric esters, carbamates, carboxylic esters, formamidines, tin compounds and materials produced by microorganisms.<br><br>

The abovementioned components for combinations are known active substances, many of which are described in Ch.R Worthing, SJB. Walker, The Pesticide Manual, 12th Edition, British Crop Protection Council, Farnham 2000.<br>
The effective use doses of the compounds employed in the invention can vary within wide limits, particularly depending on the nature of the pest to be eliminated or degree of infestation, for example, of crops with these pests. In general, the compositions according to the invention usually contain about 0.05 to about 95% (by weight) of one or more active ingredients according to the invention, about 1 to about 95% of one or more solid or liquid carriers and, optionally, about 0.1 to about 50% of one or more other compatible components, such as surface-active agents or the like. In the present account, the term "carrier" denotes an organic or inorganic ingredient, natural or synthetic, with which the active ingredient is combined to facilitate its application, for example, to the plant, to seeds or to the soil. This carrier is therefore generally inert and it must be acceptable (for example, agronomically acceptable, particularly to the treated plant).<br>
The carrier may be a solid, for example, clays, natural or synthetic silicates, silica, resins, waxes, solid fertilizers (for example ammonium salts), ground natural minerals, such as kaolins, clays, talc, chalk, quartz, attapulgite, montmorillonite, bentonite or diatomaceous earth, or ground synthetic minerals, such as silica, h alumina, or silicates especially aluminium or magnesium silicates. As solid carriers for granules the following are suitable: crushed or fractionated natural rocks such as calcite, marble, pumice, sepiolite and dolomite; synthetic granules of inorganic or<br><br>
organic meals; granules of organic material such as sawdust, coconut shells, corn cobs, corn husks or tobacco stalks; kieselguhr, tricalcium phosphate, powdered cork, or absorbent carbon black; water soluble polymers, resins, waxes; or solid fertilizers. Such solid compositions may, if desired, contain one or more compatible wetting,, dispersing, emulsifying or colouring agents which, when solid, may also serve as a diluent<br>
The carrier may also be liquid, for example: water; alcohols, particularly butanol or<br>
glycol, as well as their ethers or esters, particularly methylglyco! acetate; ketones,<br>
particularly acetone, cyclohexanone, methylethyl ketone, methylisobutylketone, or<br>
isophorone; petroleum fractions such as paraffinic or aromatic hydrocarbons,<br>
. particularly xylenes or alkyl naphthalenes; mineral or vegetable oils; aliphatic<br>
chlorinated hydrocarbons, particularly trichloroethane or methylene chloride;<br>
aromatic chlorinated hydrocarbons, particularly chlorobenzenes; water-soluble or<br>
strongly polar solvents such as dimethylformamide, dimethyl sulphoxide, or N-<br>
methylpyrrolidone; liquefied gases; or the like or a mixture thereof.<br>
The surface-active agent may be an emulsifying agent, dispersing agent or wetting<br>
agent of the ionic or non-ionic type or a mixture of such surface-active agents.<br>
Amongst these are e.g., salts of polyacrylic acids, salts of lignosulphonic acids, salts<br>
of phenolsulphonic or naphthalenesulphonic acids, polycondensates of ethylene<br>
oxide with fatty alcohols or fatty acids or fatty esters or fatty amines, substituted<br>
phenols (particularly alkylphenols or arylphenols), salts of sulphosuccinic acid esters,<br>
taurine derivatives (particularly alkyltaurates), phosphoric esters of alcohols or of .<br>
polycondensates of ethylene oxide with phenols, esters of fatty acids with polyols, or<br>
sulphate, sulphonate or phosphate functional derivatives of the above compounds.<br>
The presence of at least one surface-active agent is generally essential when the<br>
active ingredient and/or the inert carrier are only slightly water soluble or are not	,<br>
water soluble and the carrier agent of the composition, for application is water. Compositions of the invention may further contain other additives such as adhesives or colorants. Adhesives such as carboxymethylcellulose or natural or synthetic polymers in the form of powders, granules or lattices, such as arabic gum, polyvinyl alcohol or polyvinyl acetate, natural phospholipids, such as cephalins or lecithins, or synthetic phospholipids can be used in the formulations.  It is possible to use<br><br>
colorants such as inorganic pigments, for example: iron oxides, titanium oxides or Prussian Blue; organic dyestuffs, such as alizarin dyestuffs, azo dyestuffs or metal phthalocyanine dyestuffs; or trace nutrients such as salts of iron, manganese, boron, copper, cobalt, molybdenum or zinc.<br>
For their agricultural application, the compounds of the invention are therefore generally in the form of compositions, which are in various solid or liquid forms. Solid forms of compositions which can be used are dusting powders (with a content of the compound of the invention, ranging up to 80%), wettable powders or granules (including water dispersible granules), particularly those obtained by extrusion, compacting, impregnation of a granular carrier, or granulation starting from a powder (the content of the compound of the invention, in these wettable powders or granules being between about 0.5 and about 80%). Solid homogenous or heterogenous compositions containing one or more compounds of the invention, for example granules, pellets, briquettes or capsules, may be used to treat standing or running water over a period of time. A similar effect may be achieved using trickle or intermittent feeds of water dispersible concentrates as described herein. Liquid compositions, for example, include aqueous or non-aqueous solutions or suspensions (such as emulsifiable concentrates, emulsions, flowables, dispersions, or solutions) or aerosols. Liquid compositions also include, in particular, emulsifiable concentrates, dispersions, emulsions, flowables, aerosols, wettable powders (or powder for spraying), dry flowables or pastes as forms of compositions which are liquid or intended to form liquid compositions when applied, for example as aqueous sprays (including low and ultra-low volume) or as fogs or aerosols. Liquid compositions, for example, in the form of emulsifiable or soluble concentrates most frequently comprise about 5 to about 80% by weight of the active ingredient, while the emulsions or solutions which are ready for application contain, in their case, about 0.01to about 20% of the active ingredient Besides the solvent, the emulsifiable or soluble concentrates may contain, when required, about 2 to about 50% of suitable additives, such as stabilizers, surface-active agents, penetrating agents, corrosion inhibitors, colorants or adhesives. Emulsions of any required concentration, which are particularly suitable for application, for example, to- plants, may be obtained from these concentrates by dilution with water. These<br><br>
compositions are included within the scope of the compositions which may be employed in the present invention. The emulsions may be in the form of water-in-c or oil-in-water type and they may have a thick consistency.<br>
The liquid compositions of this invention may, in addition to normal agricultural use applications be used for example to treat substrates or sites infested or liable to infestation by arthropods (or other pests controlled by compounds of this invention^ including, premises, outdoor or indoor storage or processing areas, containers or equipment or standing or running water.<br>
All these aqueous dispersions or emulsions or spraying mixtures can be applied, fc example, to crops by any suitable means, chiefly by spraying, at rates which are generally of the order of about 100 to about 1,200 liters of spraying mixture per hectare, but may be higher or lower (eg. low or ultra-low volume) depending upon the need or application technique. The compound or compositions according to th
The concentrated suspensions, which can be applied by spraying, are prepared so as to produce a stable fluid product which does not settle (fine grinding) and usually contain from about 10 to about 75% by weight of active ingredient, from about 0.5 to about 30% of surface-active agents, from about 0,1 to about 10% of thixotropic agents, from about 0 to about 30% of suitable additives, such as anti-foaming agents, corrosion inhibitors, stabilizers, penetrating agents, adhesives and, as the carrier, water or an organic liquid in which the active ingredient is poorly soluble or insoluble Some organic solids or inorganic salts may be dissolved in the carrier to help prevent settling or as antifreezes for water.<br>
The wettable powers (or powder for spraying) are usually prepared so that they contain from about 10 to about 80% by weight of active ingredient, from about 20 to about 90% of a solid carrier, from about 0 to about 5% of a wetting agent, from about 3 to about 10% of a dispersing agent and, when necessary, from about 0 to about<br><br>
80% of one or more stabilizers and/or other additives, such as penetrating agents, adhesives, anti-caking agents, colorants, or the like. To obtain these wettable powders, the active ingredient is thoroughly mixed in a suitable blender with additional substances which may be impregnated on the porous filler and is ground using a mill or other suitable grinder. This produces wettable powders, the wettability and the suspendability of which are advantageous. They may be suspended in water to give any desired concentration and this suspension can be employed very advantageously in particular for application to plant foliage. The "water dispersibie granules (WG)" (granules which are readily dispersible in water) have compositions which are substantially close to that of the wettable powders. They may be prepared by granulation of formulations described for the wettable powders, either by a wet route (contacting finely divided active ingredient with the inert filler and a little water, e.g. 1 to 20% by weight, or with an aqueous solution of a dispersing agent or binder, followed by drying and screening), or by a dry route (compacting followed by grinding and screening). The rates and concentrations of the formulated compositions may vary according to the method of application or the nature of the compositions or use thereof. Generally speaking, the compositions for application to control arthropod or plant nematode pests usually contain from about 0.00001% to about 95%, more particularly from about 0.0005% to about 50% by weight of one or more compounds of the invention, or of total active ingredients (that is to say the compounds of the invention, together with other substances toxic to arthropods or plant nematodes, synergists, trace elements or stabilizers). The actual compositions employed and their.rate of application will be selected to achieve the desired effect(s) by the farmer, livestock producer, medical or veterinary practitioner, pest control operator or other person skilled in the art.<br>
Solid or liquid compositions for application topically to animals, timber, stored products or household goods usually contain from about 0.00005% to about 90%, more particularly from about 0.001% to about 10%, by weight of one or more .   compounds of the invention. For administration to animals orally orparenterally, including percutaneously solid or liquid compositions, these normally contain from about 0.1 % to about 90% by weight of one or more compounds of the invention.<br><br>
Medicated feedstuffs normally contain from about 0.001% to about 3% by weight of one or more compounds of the invention. Concentrates or supplements for mixing with feedstuffs normally contain from about 5% to about 90%, preferably from about 5% to about 50%, by weight of one or more compounds of the invention. Mineral salt licks normally contain from about 0.1 % to about 10% by weight of one or more compounds of formula (I) or pesticidally acceptable salts thereof. Dusts or liquid compositions for application to livestock, goods, premises or outdoor areas may contain from about 0.0001% to about 15%, more especially from about 0.005% to about 2.0%, by weight, of one or more compounds of the invention. Suitable concentrations in treated waters are between about 0.0001 ppm and about 20 ppm, more particularly about 0.001 ppm to about 5.0 ppm. of one or more compounds of the invention, and may be used therapeutically in fish farming with appropriate exposure times. Edible baits may contain from about 0.01% to about 5%, preferably from about 0.01% to about 1.0%, by weight, of one or more compounds of the invention.<br>
When administered to vertebrates parenterally, orally or by percutaneous or other means, the dosage of compounds of the invention, will depend upon the species, • age, or health of the vertebrate and upon the nature and degree of its actual or potential infestation by arthropod or helminth pests. A single dose of about 0.1 to about 100 mg, preferably about 2.0 to about 20.0 mg, per kg body weight of the animal or doses of about 0.01 to about 20.0 mg, preferably about 0.1 to about 5.0 mg, per kg body weight of the animal per day, for sustained medication, are generally suitable by oral or parenteral administration. By use of sustained release formulations or devices, the daily doses required over a period of months may be combined and administered to animals on a single occasion.<br>

METHODS OF PESTICIDAL USE<br>
The following representative test procedures, using compounds of the invention, were conducted to determine the parasiticidal and pesticidal activity of compounds of the invention.<br>
METHOD A: Screening method to test systemicity of compounds against Ctenocephalides felis (Cat flea)<br>
A test container was filled with 10 adults of Ctenocephalides felis. A glass cylinder was closed on one end with parafiim and placed on top of the test container. The test compound solution was then pipetted into bovine blood and added to the glass cylinder. The treated Ctenocephalides felis were.held in this artificial dog test (blood 37 °C, 40-60 % relative humidity; Ctenocephalides felis 20-22°C, 40-60 % relative humidity) and assessment performed at 24 and 48 hours after application. Compound numbers 1-2, 1-8, 1-9, 1-10, 1-14, 1-15, 1-16, 1-17, 1-19, 1-34, 1-35, 1-36, 1-37, 1-38, 1-39, 1-40, 2-2, 2-8, 2-9, 2-10, 2-14, 2-16, 2-17, 2-19, 2-35, 2-36 and 3-19 gave at least 90% control of Ctenocephalides felis at a test concentration of 5ppm or less.<br>
METHOD B: Diabrotica undecimpunctata (southern corn rootworm) screen Two days before application, seeds of maize were soaked in water under warm conditions to elicit fast germination. One day before application, eggs of Diabrotica undecimpunctata were transferred to one half of a Japanese filter paper placed in a plastic petri dish. Afterwards, a sprouted maize seed was placed on a moistened pad beside the filter paper. Three drops of 200 microlitres of test conripound solution were carefully pipetted onto the egg. The remainder of the solution was placed on the maize and then the Petri dish was closed. The treated eggs in the Petri dishes were held in a climate chamber for 6 days. The compound efficacy (percentage of dead " eggs and/or larvae in comparison to untreated control) was assessed 6 days after application using a binocular microscope.<br>
Compound numbers 1-17, 1-19,1-35, 1-36, 1-38,1-39, 2-9, 2-19, 2-35 and 2-36 gave at least 90% control of Diabrotica undecimpunctata at a test concentration of 10ppm.<br><br>
METHOD C: Nephotettix Cinciceps (rice Ieafhopper) screen<br>
The leaves of 12 rice plants having a stem length of 8 cm v/ere dipped for 5 seconds<br>
into an aqueous solution of the formulated test compound. After the solution had run<br>
off, the rice plants treated in this manner were placed in a Petri dish and populated<br>
with about 20 larvae (L3 stage) of Nephotettix cincticeps. The Petri dish was closed<br>
and then stored in a climate chamber (16 hours of light/day, 25°C, 40-60% relative<br>
humidity). After 6 days storage, the percentage mortality of Ieafhopper larvae was<br>
determined.<br>
Compound numbers 1-8, 1-9, 1-19,1-35,1-37, 2-2, 2-8, 2-19 and 2-36 gave at least<br>
98% mortality of Nephotettix cinciceps larvae at a test concentration of 100 ppm.<br>
METHOD D: Screening method to test contact activity against Ctenocephalides felis<br>
(Cat flea)<br>
Solutions of the test compounds were dropped onto filter paper, dried and the filter<br>
paper placed into test tubes and infested with 10 adults of Ctenocephalides felis. The<br>
treated Ctenocephalides felis were held in a climate chamber (26°C, 80% RH) and<br>
the percentage efficacy assessed 24 hours and 48 hours after application in<br>
comparison with the untreated control.<br>
Compound numbers 1-2, 8-2 and 8-10 gave at least 70% contact control of<br>
Ctenocephalides felis at a test concentration of 1000 ppm.<br>
METHOD E: Screening method to test contact activity against Rhipicephalus sanguineus (Brown dog tick)<br>
Solutions of the test compounds were dropped onto filter paper, dried and the filter paper placed into test tubes and infested with 20-30 larvae (L1) of Rhipicephalus sanguineus and the tubes closed with a clip. The treated Rhipicephalus sanguineus were held in a climate chamber (25°C, 90% RH) and-the percentage efficacy assessed 24 hours after application in comparison with the untreated control.   • Compound numbers 1-2, 3-3, 8-8, 8-10 and 8-22 gave at least 70% contact control of Rhipicephalus sanguineus at a test concentration of 100 ppm.<br><br><br><br><br>
