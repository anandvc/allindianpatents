noxious arthropods directly and/or at a habitat of noxious arthropods such as plant, animal soil and the like.<br>
When the noxious  arthropod controlling agent of the present invention is used for a control of pests in agriculture and forestry, the application amount is usually 1 to 10,000 g/ha, preferably 10 to 500 g/ha, as an active ingredient.

These formulations may be sprayed directly to the plant to be protected from noxious arthropods.  The noxious arthropods living in the soil can be controlled by treating the soil with these formulations, and the formulations can also be applied to treat seedbeds prior to the planting plants or to treat planting holes or plant bottoms in the planting. Furthermore, the sheet formulation of the noxious arthropod controlling agent of the present invention can be applied by a method such as winding around plants, stretching in the vicinity of plants and laying on the soil surface at the plant bottom.<br>
