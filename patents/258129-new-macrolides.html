New Macrolides<br>
This invention relates to new macrolide antibiotics with improved activity, to medicaments comprising such antibiotics and to the use of such antibiotics for the treatment of infectious diseases and inflammatory diseases.<br>
Macrolides are an effective and safe class of antibiotics. Among the commonly used macrolides are erythromycin, and the second generation agents clarithromycin and azithromycin. More recently the 3-keto macrolides, the so-called ketolides, have been developed that show improved activity towards macrolide-resistant bacteria.<br>
Ketolides having a five-membered lactone ring fused to the macrolide ring have been disclosed in WO 02/163S0, WO 03/O725S8, WO 02/50091, WO 02/50092, WO 03/024986 and US 2004/003S915. Macrolides having a five-membered lactone ring fused to the macrolide ring and a clndinose sugar attached to the macroiide ring have been disclosed in WO 03/042228 and in WO 03/004509, However, in WO 03/042228, the substitution of the cladinose sugar is different from the substitution of the compounds described hereafter, and in WO 03/004509, no sulfur atom is attached to the five-membered lactone ring.<br>
Furthermore, macrolides have been reported to possess anti-inflammatory activity, and interest in the therapeutic potential of this anti-inflammatory activity has increased recently (e.g. Journal of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy, 1998, 41, Suppl. B, 37-46).<br>
The invention provides new macrolide antibiotics of the following general formula I with improved biological properties:<br><br><br>
wherein<br>
Rl	is a residue-Y-X-Q;<br>
Y	isS, SOorSOi;<br>
X	is a bond or a linear group wilh up to 9 atoms consisting of C, K 0<br>
and/or S, of which up lo 2 atoms can bo N, one atom can be O or S, one carbon atom can appear as a CO group, one sulphur atom can appear as an SO2 group and two adjacent C atoms can be present as -CH=CH-or-CeC-;<br>
Q	is hydrogen, atkyi, heterocyclyl or aryl;<br>
*	indicates a chiral centre which is in the (R) or (S) form, i.e.<br>
including diastereomeric mixtures and separate stereomeric forms;<br>
and pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts ot in vivo cleavable esters thereof.<br>
The compounds defined above are new and possess potent antimicrobial properties against Gram-positive and selected Gram-negative organisms, Therefore, they are useful as agents against Gram-positive pathogens such as staphylococci, streptococci, pneumococci and propionibacteria as well as some Gram-negative strains such as H. influenzae and may be used in human or veterinary medicine for treatment or prevention of infections caused by susceptible organisms including those resistant to erythromycin, clindamycin and tetracycline.<br><br>
In addition to their antimicrobial properties they possess potent anti-inflammatory properties and may be used in human or veterinary medicine for treatment or prevention of inflammation.<br>

If desired, compounds of formula I can be converted into a pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt. The salt formation is effected at room temperature with methods which are known per se and which are familiar to any person skilled in the art. Not only salts with inorganic acids, but also salts with organic acids come into consideration. Hydrochlorides, hydrobromides, sulfates, nitrates, citrates, acetates, trifluoroacetates, maleates, succinates, methanesulphonates, p-toluenesulphonates and the like are examples of such salts.<br>
Further, the compounds can be converted into in vivo cleavable esters, for example into esters with the 2-hydroxy group of the sugar moiety, such esters are e.g. acetates, pivaloyl esters, tartrates, maleates, succinates, and the like. These esters can be prepared according to methods known in the art, for example by reaction with an appropriate anhydride.<br>
The compounds of the present invention and their pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts or in vivo cleavable esters thereof are useful as antibacterial and antiinflammatory therapeutics. Compounds of formula I possess excellent antibacterial activity against selected pathogenic bacteria such as strains of Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae. They can thus be used as medicaments for the treatment of<br><br>
infectious diseases, especially of infections caused by staphylococci such as septicemia, skin and soft tissue infections, dt^p infections after trauma, surgery, or insertion of foreign material, endocarditis, pneumonia, arthritis, bursitis, and osteomyelitis; or infections caused by streptococci such as septicemia, skin and soft tissue infections, deep infections after trauma, surgery, or insertion of foreign material, endocarditis, tonsillopharyngitis, pneumonia, bronchopneumonia, bronchitis, otitis, sinusitis, and scarlet fever.<br>
Furthermore compounds of formula I possess excellent antibacterial activity against selected bacteria such as strains of Propionibaclerium acnes and Propionibacterium granulosum. They can thus be used as medicaments for the treatment of acne.<br>
Furthermore, compounds of formula I can be used as medicaments for the treatment of infections caused by germs such as Kioraxeiia catarrhal is, Haemophilus spp., Neisseria spp., Legionella spp.. Mycoplasma spp,, Ureapiasma urealyticum, Rickettsia spp,, Bartonella spp,, Coxielfa burnetii. Chlamydia spp., or susceptible strains of Mycobacterium spp., Kocurdta spp., and Actinomyces spp.<br>
In addition to the antibacterial activity compounds of formula I possess anti-inflammatory activity, making them particularly useful for the treatment of diseases such as diffuse panbronchioiitis, cystic fibrosis, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), inflammatory bowel diseases, rosacea, arthritis and inflammatory acne. The compounds of the present invention are also useful for the treatment of psoriasis.<br>
The neutrophil granulocyte is a key element of the inflammatory process. The neutrophils<br>
migrate to the site of inflammation and can be activated to release toxic products, including proteolytic enzymes such as elastase. The initiation of the neutrophil response is mediated by cell surface receptors for chemoattractants including bacterial products, platelet activating factor, leukotriene B4, and interleukin 8. Elastase is a major secreted product of activated neutrophils and is a major contributor to the destruction of tissue in inflammatory disease. Several bioassays based on the repression of secretion of elastase, have been described and used for the detection of anti-inflammatory products (Johansson, S., GSransson, U.f Luijendik T., Backhand, A., Claeson P., Bohlin L. (2002) J. Nat. Prod. 65:<br><br>
32-41). As exemplified below (example 35), this test is used to show the modulatory activities of the compounds of the present invention against neutrophil granulocytes. The neutrophils are activated by addition of the bacterial product N-forrnyl methionyl-Ieucyi-phenylalanine (fMLP) and cytochaiasin B, a stimulator of secretion. The amount of elastase secreted is determined by measuring the reaction of elastase with the chromogenic substrate succinyl-alanyl-alanyl-valyl-nitroanilide (SAAVNA), which generates 4-nitroaniiine after cleavage by elastase. The reaction is followed by measuring the absorption change at 405 nm.<br>
MIC values for non-anaerobes were obtained by broth'microdilution using CAMHB (BBL) according to NCCLS guidelines (National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards. Methods for dilution antimicrobial susceptibility tests for bacteria that grow aerobicaliy, 5th cd. Approved standard M7-A6. NCCLS, Wayne, Pennsylvania, 2003). Drugs were dissolved in DMSO prior to dispensing into 96-weli microtitre plates; the concentration of DMSO in assay wells never exceeded 2% (7v). CAMHB was supplemented with 5% (7v) horse serum (Sigma, cat. no. H-1270) in lieu of hiked horse blood for cultivation of Streptococcus pneumoniae, and with 5% (v/v) Fildes enrichment (BBL, cat. no. 220810) supernate in lieu of Haemophilus Test Medium and additives for cultivation of Haemophilus influenzae (Pankuch GA, Hoellman DB, Lin G, Bajaksouzian S, Jacobs MR, Appelbaum PC. Activity of HMR 3647 compared to those of five agents against Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella caiarrhalis by MIC determination and time-kill assay. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1998 Nov; 42(11): 3032-4). Activities expressed as the minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) (ng/ml) are given in the following Table 3, and the microorganisms used for testing are listed in Table 2 below.<br>
MIC values towards strains of propionibacteria were obtained by broth microdilution using WCB (Anaerobe Broth MIC, Difco) according to NCCLS guidelines (National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards. Methods for anti-microbial susceptibility testing of anaerobic bacteria, 5lh ed.; approved standard. NCCLS publication no. Ml 1-A5. NCCLS, Wayne, Pennsylvania, 2001). Microtitre plates were loaded into 7-L GENbox anaerobic incubation jars (BioMerieux, cat. no. 96 128) fitted with anaerobic atmosphere generators (BioMerieux, cat. no. 96 124) and a Dry Anaerobic Indicator Strip (BBL, cat. no. 271051).<br><br><br><br><br>
It has also been found that the compounds of the present invention exhibit substantial inhibitory activity towards human phosphodiesterases (PDEs), in particular towards PDE3 and especially PDE4, which have been shown to be inv.olved in inflammatory processes (cf. e.g. Lipworth B. J., Lancet (2005) 365, p. 167 or Giembycz M. A.. Curr. Opin. Pharmacol. (2005), 5, p. 238). This is shown in Examples 36 and 37 below, for the first time for a macrolide derivative like an erythromycin derivative. The use of the compounds of such macrolide derivatives, in particular of compounds according to the present invention for the treatment of diseases and disorders in humans which can be ameliorated or relieved by inhibition of human phodiesterases, in particular phosphodiesterase 3 and 4 (including inflammatory diseases as mentioned above) is therefore a further aspect of the present invention.<br><br>
The compounds in accordance with the invention can be used as medicaments. They possess good oral absorption properties. A further embodiment of the present invention are thus medicaments comprising compounds of formula I, their pharmaceutical acceptable acid addition salts or in vivo cleavable esters thereof for the treatment and prevention of infectious diseases, for example, in the form of pharmaceutical preparations for enteral (oral) administration. The products in accordance with the invention can be administered, for example, perorally, such as in the form of tablets, film coated tablets, sugar coated tablets, hard and soft capsules, solutions, emulsions or suspensions, or rectally, such as in the form of suppositories, or parenterally e.g. by injection, or nasally, or by inhalation or transdermally, or locally for example by topical administration, preferably the compounds are administered topically or orally.<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions containing these compounds can be prepared using conventional procedures familiar to those skilled in the art, such as by combining "the ingredients into a dosage form together with suitable, non-toxic, inert, therapeutically compatible solid or liquid carrier materials and, if desired, the usual pharmaceutical adjuvants.<br>
It is contemplated that the compounds are ultimately embodied into compositions of suitable oral, parenteral or topical dosage forms. The compositions of this invention can contain, as optional ingredients, any of the various adjuvants which are used ordinarily in the production of pharmaceutical preparations. Thus, for example, in formulating the present compositions into the desired oral dosage forms, one may use. as optional ingredients, fillers, such as microcrystaliine cellulose, calcium phosphate or lactose; disintegrating agents, such as starch, crosslinked carboxymethylcellulose sodium.or crosslinked polyvinylpyrrolidone; and lubricating agents, such as talc, magnesium stearate, calcium stearate, and the like. It should be fully understood, however, that the optional ingredients herein named are given by way of example only and that the invention is not restricted to the use hereof. Other such adjuvants, which are well known in the art, can be employed in carrying out this invention.<br><br>

Chem. 1988, 53,2340-2345.<br>
The hydroxy group at position 12 of compounds of formula IV is esterificd by treatment with 2-chloro acetic acid, DCC and DMAP or with 2-chloro acetic anhydride, pyridine, DMAP in a chlorinated solvent such as methylene chloride. The intermediate V is then treated with the appropriate nuclcophiie R1H in acetone in the presence of a base such as DBU to give compounds of formula VI wherein Rl, Rpj and Rp^ are as defined above. Depending on the nature of Rl compounds of formula VI can also be synthesised by reacting compound of formula IV with an appropriate carboxyiic acid (RlCPhCOOH), DCC and DMAP in a chlorinated solvent such as methyiene chloride to give compounds of formula VI. Compounds of formula VI are treated with an alkali metal base such as NaH or potassium rcv7.-butoxide or LDA in an aprotic solvent such as DMF orTHF to give compounds of formula VII as mixture of diastereoisomers in various ratios (scheme 1),<br>
Compounds of formula VII wherein Rl, Rpi and Rp2 are as defined above are deprotected at the 2'-position with methanol at temperatures ranging from 20°C to 60°C during 2-5 days to give compounds of formula VIII (scheme 2). The 4"-hydroxyl group is deprotected by treatment of the compound with DBU in refluxmg methanol for 3 to 12 hours (J. Antibiotics, 2001, 54(8), 664) or by treatment with guanidine/guanidinium nitrate in methanol/dichloromethane (Tetrahedron Letters 1997, 38(9), 1627) or with potassium carbonate in methanol or with a mixture of MeONa in methanol, preferably with DBU in refiuxing methanol for 5 to 7 hours to give compounds of formula VIII.<br><br><br>
In the case where Rl is S-Rp3 and Rp3 is a sulphur protecting group e.g. benzyl, 4-methoxybenzyl, 3,4-dimethoxybenzyl or 4-nitro-benzyi, preferably 4-methoxybenzyl the intermediate Vila is transformed in the presence of molecular sieves into disulfide derivative IX wherein Rpj and Rp2 are as defined above and Rp^ is e.g. 3-nitro-2-pyridinyl or methyl similar to the method described in WO03/072588.<br>
Compounds of formula IX are treated with a reducing agent such as a trialkyl phosphine, preferably tributy] phosphine, or a triaryl phosphine, preferably tripheny! phosphine, in a<br><br>
solvent such as aqueous acetone, aqueous dimethyl formamide, aqueous dioxane or aqueous tetrahydrofuran, preferably aqueous dimethyl formamide, at 0°C to 60°C, preferably at room temperature for 1 minute to 1 hour, preferably 15 minutes, to give compound X. Compound X is treated, preferably without isolation, directly in the same solvent system with compounds of the formula Q-X-Lg, in which Q and X are defined as before and Lg is a leaving group, e.g. chloride, bromide, iodide, metbanesulfonyloxy, p-tosylsulfonyloxy, trifluormethansulfonyloxy or a vinyl group in the case where X represents a carbonyl or a sulfonyl group to give compounds of formula VII. The reaction is preferably effected in the presence of a base such as alkali metal carbonate or hydrogen carbonate, e.g. potassium carbonate, cesium carbonate orsodium hydrogen carbonate, or an organic base, e.g. triethylamine, N-ethyl N,N-diisopropylnmine, 1,8-diaznbicyclo[5A0]undec-7-ene or l,5-diazabicyclo[4.3.0]non-5-ene4 preferably 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undce-7-ene at temperature between 0°C and 5G°C\ preferably at 20°C.
