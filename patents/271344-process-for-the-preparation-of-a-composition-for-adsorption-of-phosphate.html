				<td>DESCRIPTION:	<br>
The present invention relates to a process for the<br>
preparation of a novel composition, and to the use of the<br>
composition as a phosphate adsorbent, in particular for<br>
administration in humans or animals.<br>
An adsorbent for phosphate from aqueous media is known from<br>
EP 0 8 68 12 5, which adsorbent contains polynuclear β-iron<br>
hydroxide stabilised by carbohydrates and/or humic acid.<br>
The product is produced by reacting an iron(III) chloride<br>
solution with a base (in particular soda solution) and<br>
adding the carbohydrate or humic acid before the resulting<br>
iron hydroxide ages. The use of the iron(III) chloride<br>
solution in the precipitation is necessary because the<br>
presence of chloride ions is essential for the formation of<br>
the β-iron hydroxide (akaganeite) . It is assumed that the<br>
addition of the carbohydrate or humic acid causes<br>
stabilisation of the freshly prepared β-iron hydroxide, as<br>
a result of which the resulting material exhibits a<br>
superior phosphate-absorbing capacity as compared with a<br>
mixture of aged β-iron hydroxide with carbohydrates or<br>
humic acid.<br>
However, the use of iron(III) chloride as the starting<br>
material in the preparation of the phosphate adsorbent<br>
according to EP 0 868 125 gives rise to problems. For<br>
example, the use of iron(III) chloride leads to corrosion<br>
problems in the installation owing to the presence of<br><br>
chloride ions. In addition, the cost of iron(III) chloride<br>
is relatively high.<br>
It was, therefore, desirable to provide a phosphate<br>
adsorbent that does not exhibit the above-described<br>
disadvantages owing to the use of iron(III) chloride as<br>
starting material. At the same time, the phosphate<br>
adsorbent should have substantially the same phosphate -<br>
adsorbing capacity as the material according to EP<br>
0 868 125.<br>
The present inventors have now found, surprisingly, that by<br>
using iron sulfate and/or iron nitrate compounds as<br>
starting material it is possible, without using iron(III)<br>
chloride, to obtain an iron hydroxide which is evidently<br>
likewise stabilised, for example, by carbohydrates or humic<br>
acids and whose phosphate-adsorbing capacity corresponds<br>
substantially to that of the material of EP 0 868 125. On<br>
the basis of this finding, the inventors completed the<br>
present patent application.<br>
The invention accordingly provides a process for the<br>
preparation of a composition, comprising the following<br>
steps:<br>
a)	adding at least one base to an aqueous, sulfate-<br>
and/or nitrate-containing iron(III) salt solution to<br>
form a precipitate of iron hydroxide,<br>
b)	optionally washing the resulting precipitate one or<br>
more times with water, yielding an aqueous suspension<br>
of the iron hydroxide,<br><br>
c)	adding to the resulting aqueous suspension at least<br>
one further constituent that inhibits ageing of the<br>
precipitate of iron hydroxide obtained in step b),<br>
d)	drying the composition obtained in step c) .<br>
In step a), an aqueous, sulfate- and/or nitrate-containing<br>
iron(III) salt solution is reacted with at least one base<br>
to form a precipitate of iron hydroxide.<br>
The aqueous, sulfate-containing iron(III) salt solution may<br>
be in particular a solution of iron(III) sulfate (Fe2(SO4)3)<br>
(including its hydrates) in water. It is also possible,<br>
however, to use other aqueous, sulfate-containing iron(III)<br>
salt solutions, such as solutions of iron alums, such as<br>
KFe(SO4)2 or NH4Fe(SO4)2- It is further possible according to<br>
the invention to use sulfuric-acid-containing solutions of<br>
iron(II) sulfate, which are subjected to oxidation, for<br>
example with nitric acid.<br>
The aqueous, sulfate-containing iron(III) salt solution<br>
that is used preferably has a concentration of<br>
approximately from 3 to 16 wt.%, based on the amount of<br>
iron.<br>
The aqueous, nitrate-containing iron(III) salt solution may<br>
be in particular a solution of iron(III) nitrate (Fe(NO3)3)<br>
(including its hydrates) in water.<br>
The aqueous, nitrate-containing iron(III) salt solution<br>
that is used preferably has a concentration of<br>
approximately from 3 to 16 wt.%, based on the amount of<br>
iron.<br><br>
The amount of base added in step a) is expediently so<br>
chosen that a pH value of at least about 3, preferably of<br>
at least about 6, is established. Expediently, the amount<br>
of base used is such that, from an economic point of view,<br>
the iron precipitates from the solution as completely as<br>
possible. In general, therefore, the procedure is carried<br>
out at pH values of not more than about 10. Higher pH<br>
values are no longer expedient from an economic point of<br>
view. The pH value established in step a) is, therefore,<br>
preferably approximately from 3 to 10, more preferably<br>
approximately from 5 to 8.<br>
There is preferably used as the base in step a) an alkali<br>
metal and/or alkaline earth metal compound. Such compounds<br>
are particularly preferably hydroxides or carbonates of<br>
alkali or alkaline earth metals. Alkali carbonates, alkali<br>
bicarbonates and alkali metal hydroxides, especially of<br>
sodium, are more preferred. The bases are expediently and<br>
preferably used in the form of an aqueous solution,<br>
preferably having a molarity of approximately from 0.01 to<br>
2 mol/1. It is, however, also possible to add the bases in<br>
solid form to the sulfate- and/or nitrate-containing<br>
iron(III) salt solution.<br>
There is most preferably used as the base in step a) sodium<br>
hydroxide, sodium carbonate and/or sodium bicarbonate,<br>
preferably in the form of their aqueous solutions.<br>
The reaction with the base is preferably not carried out at<br>
elevated temperatures, because these might lead to<br>
accelerated ageing of the hydroxide that is formed. The<br><br>
temperature in the reaction is preferably maintained in the<br>
range from 10 to 40°C, more preferably from 2 0 to 30°C; even<br>
more preferably, the reaction is carried out at room<br>
temperature (2 5°C) . The suspension can expediently be<br>
allowed to rest for a short time after the precipitation.<br>
In practice, the suspension can be left to stand, for<br>
example, for from 1 to 5 hours at room temperature or<br>
below. During that time, the suspension can be stirred.<br>
The resulting precipitate is then preferably washed once,<br>
preferably several times, with water, the water being<br>
removed after the washing/suspension operation in each case<br>
preferably by decanting, filtering, centrifugation and/or<br>
by processes of reverse osmosis, for example by membrane<br>
filtration. The resulting moist product is not dried. The<br>
moist product is suspended in water. The amount of water is<br>
not critical; preferably, the procedure is such that the<br>
iron content of the resulting suspension (calculated as Fe)<br>
is up to 10 wt.%, particularly preferably from 2 to 8 wt.%.<br>
The resulting aqueous suspension of the iron hydroxide<br>
preferably has an approximately neutral pH value in the<br>
range of approximately from 6.5 to 7.5, before the further<br>
constituent is added. Lower pH values would result in the<br>
iron hydroxide going partly into solution again. Higher pH<br>
values are undesirable because they can lead to complex<br>
formation in step c).<br>
The process according to the invention is particularly<br>
preferably carried out in such a manner that substantially<br>
no ageing of the iron hydroxide has occurred before the<br>
addition of the further constituent in step c). During the<br><br>
ageing of precipitates, the re-grouping of initially<br>
randomly placed molecules to form a more or less regular<br>
crystal lattice often takes place. The ageing of<br>
precipitates in most cases involves not only<br>
crystallisation but also particle enlargement as a result<br>
of Ostwald ripening.<br>
In step c) there is added to the suspension obtained above<br>
at least one further constituent that inhibits the above-<br>
described ageing of the precipitate of iron hydroxide<br>
obtained in step b). This constituent inhibiting ageing of<br>
the iron hydroxide can preferably be selected from the<br>
group consisting of carbohydrates, carbohydrate derivatives<br>
and humic acid. The constituent is preferably added in<br>
solid form, but addition in the form of an aqueous solution<br>
is also possible in principle.<br>
According to the invention there are particularly<br>
preferably used as the further ageing-inhibiting<br>
constituent carbohydrates, such as various carbohydrates<br>
and sugars, for example agarose, dextran, dextrin,<br>
maltodextrin, dextrin derivatives, dextran derivatives,<br>
starch, cellulose, such as microcrystalline cellulose and<br>
cellulose derivatives, sucrose, maltose, lactose or<br>
mannitol.<br>
Particular preference is given to starch, sucrose, dextrin<br>
and/or a mixture thereof. Starch, sucrose or a mixture<br>
thereof are most preferred. A mixture of sucrose and at<br>
least one further constituent selected in particular from<br>
starch, maltodextrin and cellulose, especially<br>
microcrystalline cellulose, is very preferred. The function<br><br>
of the additional constituent is presumably - without being<br>
bound to one theory - to be regarded as that of stabilising<br>
the freshly precipitated iron hydroxide, whereby ageing of<br>
the iron hydroxide precipitate is prevented.<br>
It is preferable to select the amount of carbohydrates or<br>
humic acid so that at least 0.5 g, preferably at least 1 g,<br>
of the further constituent inhibiting ageing of the iron<br>
hydroxide, such as carbohydrate and/or humic acid, is added<br>
per g of iron (calculated as Fe). Preferably, the iron<br>
content of the resulting composition should be not more<br>
than 50 wt.%, preferably not more than about 40 wt.%. The<br>
iron content of the resulting composition should preferably<br>
be at least 20 wt.%. The maximum content of the constituent<br>
inhibiting ageing of the iron hydroxide, such as<br>
carbohydrates and/or humic acid, is not subject to any<br>
limitation and is determined primarily by economic reasons.<br>
The mentioned content is preferably approximately from 5 to<br>
60 wt.%, more preferably approximately from 20 to 60 wt.%.<br>
After the addition in step c) of the constituent inhibiting<br>
ageing of the iron hydroxide, the resulting aqueous<br>
suspension is dried in a manner known per se. The drying<br>
can be carried out, for example, by concentration in vacuo<br>
or by spray drying.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the process according to the<br>
invention, at least one calcium salt is added before or<br>
after the composition obtained according to the invention<br>
is dried. Suitable calcium salts are, for example, salts of<br>
inorganic or organic acids, in particular calcium acetate.<br>
The addition of the calcium salt increases the<br><br>
phosphate-binding capacity, especially at higher pH values.<br>
It is particularly advantageous to use such adsorbents<br>
provided with calcium salts at pH values of more than 5,<br>
because even then the complete phosphate-binding capacity<br>
is retained. It has been shown that an addition of from<br>
400 mg to 2 g, for example about 1 g, of calcium salt,<br>
especially calcium acetate, per g of iron is particularly<br>
advantageous.<br>
The material obtained according to the invention is<br>
substantially a physical mixture of iron hydroxide and the<br>
constituent inhibiting ageing of the iron hydroxide, such<br>
as carbohydrates or humic acid. As already mentioned above,<br>
it is assumed that the latter come into contact with the<br>
freshly precipitated iron hydroxide and lead to<br>
stabilisation of the iron hydroxide, so that no ageing of<br>
the material, which reduces the phosphate-adsorbing<br>
ability, occurs. Complex formation, as described in<br>
DE 42 3 9 442, cannot occur under the conditions chosen<br>
according to the invention of the addition of an aqueous<br>
suspension, because complex formation requires strongly<br>
alkaline conditions during the addition of, for example,<br>
carbohydrates to the iron hydroxide.<br>
The compositions obtained by the process according to the<br>
invention are preferably used in the production of an<br>
adsorbent for phosphate from aqueous solutions. Preferably,<br>
a preparation for oral and/or parenteral administration in<br>
humans or animals is produced from the compositions<br>
obtained by the process according to the invention. In<br>
particular, the compositions obtained according to the<br>
invention are used in the production of a preparation for<br><br>
the prophylaxis and/or treatment of the hyperphosphataemic<br>
state. Particularly preferably, the compositions obtained<br>
according to the invention are used in the production of a<br>
preparation for the prophylaxis and/or treatment of<br>
dialysis patients.<br>
To that end, the compositions obtained according to the<br>
invention are formulated in a manner known per se into<br>
pharmaceutical dosage forms, such as, for example, for oral<br>
administration. They can be formulated as such or together<br>
with conventional pharmaceutical additives, such as<br>
conventional carriers or auxiliary substances. For example,<br>
encapsulation can be carried out, it being possible to use<br>
as encapsulating agents conventional materials used in the<br>
pharmaceutical sector, such as hard or soft gelatin<br>
capsules. Microencapsulation of the compositions obtained<br>
according to the invention is also possible. It is also<br>
possible to provide the adsorbents, optionally together<br>
with auxiliary substances and additives, in the form of<br>
granules, tablets, dragees, filled into sachets, in gel<br>
form or in the form of sticks. The daily dose of the<br>
compositions obtained according to the invention is, for<br>
example, from 1 to 3 g, preferably approximately 1.5 g,<br>
based on iron.<br>
The compositions obtained according to the invention are<br>
also suitable for use for the adsorption of phosphate<br>
bonded to foodstuffs; for this purpose they may be mixed<br>
into foodstuffs, for example. To that end there may be<br>
prepared, for example, formulations as described above for<br>
medicaments.<br><br>
The compositions obtained according to the invention are<br>
suitable in particular as adsorbents especially for<br>
inorganic and foodstuffs-bonded phosphate from body fluids,<br>
chyme and foodstuffs. They have a phosphate-adsorbing<br>
ability similar to that of the agents obtained according to<br>
EP 0868125 and can be produced simply and inexpensively.<br>
The invention relates further to an adsorbent obtained by<br>
the process according to the invention.<br>
By using iron sulfate and/or iron nitrate as starting<br>
material it is possible according to the invention to<br>
obtain a composition having a particularly low content of<br>
chloride, which is present in the composition only in<br>
traces. The chloride content is especially lower than the<br>
chloride content conventional for akaganeite. The invention<br>
accordingly relates also to a composition containing<br>
iron(III) hydroxide as well as at least one constituent<br>
selected from the group consisting of carbohydrates and<br>
humic acid, which composition contains less than 0.05 wt.%,<br>
preferably less than 0.03 wt.%, more preferably less than<br>
0.01 wt.%, chloride.<br>
The invention is explained in greater detail by means of<br>
the following examples:<br>
Example 1<br>
444 g of iron(III) sulfate solution (11.3 % w/w Fe) are<br>
added dropwise in the course of 20-30 minutes, with<br>
stirring (vane-type stirrer), to 1160 g of soda solution<br>
(d20 = 1.185 g/ml). The suspension is stirred for a further<br>
one hour. Thereafter, 2 litres of water are added to the<br><br>
suspension, with stirring; the mixture is left to stand and<br>
then the supernatant solution is decanted off. This<br>
procedure is repeated five times. In this manner, 1238 g of<br>
a suspension having an iron content of 4.0 % (w/w)<br>
(determined by complexometry) are obtained. 73.9 g of each<br>
of sucrose and starch are added to the 123 8 g of the above<br>
suspension. The suspension is then concentrated in a rotary<br>
evaporator at 60°C and dried under a high vacuum at 50°C.<br>
223 g of powder having an iron content of 21.5 % (w/w) are<br>
obtained.<br>
Determination of the phosphate-adsorbing capacity:<br>
10 ml of sodium phosphate solution (13.68 g/1 Na3PO4 x<br>
12 H2O) are added to 233 mg of the material prepared<br>
according to the above Example (corresponding to 0.9 mmol<br>
of iron) (molar ratio Fe:P = 1:0.4). After adjustment of<br>
the pH value, the suspension is allowed to react at 37°C for<br>
2 hours. The suspension is then centrifuged; the<br>
supernatant is decanted off and made up to 25 ml with<br>
distilled water, and its phosphorus content is determined.<br>
The phosphate adsorption of the material prepared according<br>
to the Example, determined by ion chromatography, was 0.2 0<br>
mg P/mg Fe at a pH of 3.0 and 0.16 mg P/mg Fe at a pH of<br>
5.5.<br>
Example 2<br>
439 g of iron(III) sulfate solution (11.5 % w/w Fe) are<br>
added dropwise in the course of 20-30 minutes, with<br>
stirring (vane-type stirrer), to 1014 ml of sodium<br>
hydroxide solution (9.6 % w/v). The suspension is stirred<br>
for a further one hour. Thereafter,-2 litres of water are<br>
added to the suspension, with stirring; the mixture is left<br><br>
to stand and the supernatant solution is then decanted off.<br>
This procedure is repeated until the supernatant that is<br>
decanted off is free of sulfate (control with barium<br>
chloride). In this manner, 1606 g of a suspension having an<br>
iron content of 2.74 % (w/w) (determined by complexometry)<br>
are obtained. 66.0 g of each of sucrose and starch are<br>
added to the 1606 g of the above suspension. The suspension<br>
is then concentrated in a rotary evaporator at 60°C and<br>
dried under a high vacuum at 50°C. 190 g of powder having an<br>
iron content of 22.2 % (w/w) are obtained.<br>
Determination of the phosphate-adsorbing capacity:<br>
10 ml of sodium phosphate solution (13.68 g/1 Na3PO4 x<br>
12 H2O) are added to 226 mg of the material prepared<br>
according to the Example (corresponding to 0.9 mmol of<br>
iron) (molar ratio Fe:P = 1:0.4). After adjustment of the<br>
pH value, the suspension is allowed to react at 37°C for<br>
2 hours. The suspension is then centrifuged; the<br>
supernatant is decanted off and made up to 25 ml with<br>
distilled water, and its phosphorus content is determined.<br>
The phosphate adsorption of the material prepared according<br>
to Example 1, determined by ion chromatography, was 0.19 mg<br>
P/mg Fe at a pH of 3.0 and 0.15 mg P/mg Fe at a pH of 5.5.<br>
Example 3<br>
535 g of iron(III) nitrate solution (9.7 % w/w Fe) are<br>
added dropwise in the course of 20-3 0 minutes, with<br>
stirring (vane-type stirrer), to 1200 g of soda solution<br>
(d20 = 1.185 g/ml). The suspension is stirred for a further<br>
one hour. The suspension is then transferred to a filter<br>
bag and washed for 3 hours by continuously rinsing with<br><br>
water (conductivity of the washing water after 3 hours<br>
about 300 µS/cm) . In this manner, 923 g of a suspension<br>
having an iron content of 4.3 % (w/w) (determined by<br>
complexometry) are obtained. 60.1 g of each of sucrose and<br>
starch are added to the 923 g of the above suspension. The<br>
suspension is then concentrated in a rotary evaporator at<br>
60°C and dried under a high vacuum at 50°C. 172 g of powder<br>
having an iron content of 22.3 % (w/w) are obtained.<br>
Determination of the phosphate-adsorbing capacity:<br>
10 ml of sodium phosphate solution (13.68 g/1 Na3PO4 x<br>
12 H2O) are added to 225 mg of the material prepared<br>
according to the Example (corresponding to 0.9 mmol of<br>
iron) (molar ratio Fe:P = 1:0.4). After adjustment of the<br>
pH value, the suspension is allowed to react at 3 7°C for<br>
2 hours. The suspension is then centrifuged; the<br>
supernatant is decanted off and made up to 25 ml with<br>
distilled water, and its phosphorus content is determined.<br>
The phosphate adsorption of the material prepared according<br>
to the Example, determined by ion chromatography, was 0.21<br>
mg P/mg Fe at a pH of 3.0 and 0.17 mg P/mg Fe at a pH of<br>
5.5.<br>
Example 4<br>
234 g of iron(III) sulfate solution (11.4 % w/w Fe) are<br>
added dropwise in the course of 20-30 minutes, with<br>
stirring (vane-type stirrer), to 615 g of soda solution (d20<br>
= 1.185 g/ml). The suspension is stirred for a further .one<br>
hour. The suspension is then transferred to a filter bag<br>
and washed for about 3 hours by continuously rinsing with<br>
water (test for absence of sulfate with barium chloride).<br>
In this manner, 470 g of a suspension having an iron<br><br>
content of 6.0 % (w/w) (determined by complexometry) are<br>
obtained. 21.1 g of each of sucrose and maltodextrin are<br>
added to the 470 g of the above suspension. The suspension<br>
is then concentrated in a rotary evaporator at 60°C and<br>
dried under a high vacuum at 50°C. 66 g of powder having an<br>
iron content of 2 0.3 % (w/w) are obtained.<br>
Determination of the phosphate-adsorbing capacity:<br>
10 ml of sodium phosphate solution (13.68 g/1 Na3PO4 x<br>
12 H2O) are added to 247 mg of the material prepared<br>
according to the Example (corresponding to 0.9 mmol of<br>
iron) (molar ratio Fe:P = 1:0.4). After adjustment of the<br>
pH value, the suspension is allowed to react at 37°C for<br>
2 hours. The suspension is then centrifuged; the<br>
supernatant is decanted off and made up to 25 ml with<br>
distilled water, and its phosphorus content is determined.<br>
The phosphate adsorption of the material prepared according<br>
to the Example, determined by ion chromatography, was 0.21<br>
mg P/mg Fe at a pH of 3.0 and 0.17 mg P/mg Fe at a pH of<br>
5.5.<br>
Example 5<br>
223 g of iron(III) sulfate solution (11.3 % w/w Fe) are<br>
added dropwise in the course of 20-30 minutes, with<br>
stirring (vane-type stirrer), to 585 g of soda solution (d20<br>
= .1.185 g/ml). The suspension is stirred for a further one<br>
hour. The suspension is then transferred to a filter bag<br>
and washed for about 3 hours by continuously rinsing with<br>
water (test for absence of sulfate with barium chloride).<br>
In this manner, 447 g of a suspension having an iron<br>
content of 6.0 % (w/w) (determined by complexometry) are<br>
obtained. 2 0.6 g of each of sucrose and crystalline<br><br>
cellulose are added to the 447 g of the above suspension.<br>
The suspension is then concentrated in a rotary evaporator<br>
at 60°C and dried under a high vacuum at 50°C. 65 g of<br>
powder having an iron content of 20.6 % (w/w) are obtained.<br>
Determination of the phosphate-adsorbing capacity:<br>
10 ml of sodium phosphate solution (13.68 g/1 Na3PO4 x<br>
12 H2O) are added to 244 mg of the material prepared<br>
according to the Example (corresponding to 0.9 mmol of<br>
iron) (molar ratio Fe:P = 1:0.4). After adjustment of the<br>
pH value, the suspension is allowed to react at 37°C for<br>
2 hours. The suspension is then centrifuged; the<br>
supernatant is decanted off and made up to 2 5 ml with<br>
distilled water, and its phosphorus content is determined.<br>
The phosphate adsorption of the material prepared according<br>
to the Example, determined by ion chromatography, was 0.2 0<br>
mg P/mg Fe at a pH of 3.0 and 0.17 mg P/mg Fe at a pH of<br>
5.5.<br><br>
