				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a process for making stable high viscosity organopolysiloxane emulsion and in particular to an emulsion-polymerisation process involving a simple and cost-effective faster completion of emulsification of organopolysiloxane and also subsequent polymerisation of the organopolysiloxane. The process is directed to be simple and cost-effective and can be easily adapted for emulsion production of stable organopolysiloxane emulsions for diverse beneficial end use and application. Importantly, the silicone emulsion produced by the process of the invention is In the range of average (i.e D50 value) up to 150 nanometer with a very narrow particle size distribution which is highly stable and found to have advantageous and beneficial diverse use in various end applications including in personal care, textile -, rubber, paper and other like applications/uses.<br>
BACKGOUND ART<br>
It is well known to provide organopolysiloxane emulsions with varying partide sizes to suit different end applications.<br>
Organopolysiloxane emulsions having low partide size prepared by emulsion polymerisation process are generally preferred which could provide the desired faster and simple production with focus on emulsion stability and quicker organipotysiloxane polymerisation during emulsification. Such emulsion polymerised products are known to be prepared by various methods. For examples, JP-B 34-2041 disclosed a polymerisation process wherein a strong acid and strong base are used as a polymerisation catalyst. US 3697469 used ion-exchange resin as polymerisation catalyst. US 3360491; US 3697469; US 4228054; US 5726270; US 5817714; US 5895794; US 5925469 and US 6071975 disclosed polymerisation using alkyl benzene sulphonic acid, alkyl naphthalene sulphonic acid, aliphatic sulphonic acid, silylalkyl sulphonic acid, aliphatically substituted dipneny! ether sulfonic add or alkyl hydrogen sulphates as a catalyst. However all these processes take longer time for polymerisation and completion of the emulsion making process. Most of the processes are also only restricted to cydosiloxanes.<br>
US 6245852, discloses a process of preparation of organopolysiloxane emulsion having improved stability within a short time. The process comprising the steps of emulsifying and dispersing low molecular weight organopolysiloxane in water in presence of essentially at least one anionic surfactant selected from organic sulphonic acid and organic sulphates by using a high pressure homogeniser with a operating pressure range<br>
1<br><br>
from 700 to 3000 Kg/cm2 and produce an initial emulsion having partide size up to 300 nm, followed by allowing the emulsion for polymerisation and subsequent neutralization of the emulsion at the end.<br>
As would be dearly apparent from the disclosure in US'852 the process necessarily involves the use of very sophisticated and highly capital-intensive machine system for reduction of emulsion time in the emulsion polymerisation process. Also since the process uses a high-pressure system, the emulsion machine needs lot of control system for working safely in the production area.<br>
Thus while the process according to the above US'852 stated to reduce the time of emuIsification by using a sophisticated high pressure homogeniser but the said process does not seem to address the requirement for faster completion of the total emulsion process including faster polymerisation. Emulsion polymerisation process usually consists of emulsification of organopolysiloxane and subsequent polymerisation of the organopolysifoxane. So, faster emulsification on its own is not sufficient to complete emulsion polymerisation process or make the process faster. Therefore, it is also important to make faster polymerisation in emulsion polymerisation processes.<br>
The above state of art reveals the need to develop processes of making faster the total emulsion polymerisation process .Also the reduction in the partide size which is found to be of relevance for variety of end use/applications involving a faster emulsion polymerisation process is desirable for wide scale commercial manufacturing and use of such emulsions for diverse applications.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is thus the basic object of the invention to provide a process of making silicone emulsion having partide size up to 150 nm which would on one hand be simple, cost-effective and fast and on the other hand would provide a simple and cost effective alternative to the need for complex machinery for faster emulsification and also reduce the polymerisation time in the emulsion polymerisation process and thus can be readily adapted for large scale cost-effective commercial manufacture of such low particle size silicone emulsions for diverse applications such as in personnel care and the like.<br>
Another object of the invention is directed to provide a simple process of making silicone emulsion having partide size up to 150 nanometer, which would reduce the total "emulsion polymerisation time" significantly.<br>
2<br><br>
Another object of the present invention Is directed to a process for the manufacture of silicone emulsion having particle size up to 150 nanometer which would assist faster polymer growth of the - organopolysiloxane during emulsion process.<br>
Yet further object of the present invention is directed to making stable silicone emulsion involving standard homogenizer having particle size up to 150 nanometer by way of a selective emulsion formulation and avoiding the need for complex machinery to reduce the emulsification and polymerisation stages in such manufacture of silicone emulsion.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Thus according to the basic aspect of the present invention, there is provided a process for the manufacture of a stable emulsion having particle size up to 150 nanometer comprising:<br>
i) providing a selective formulation comprising (a) organopolysiloxane or mixtures thereof in an amount of 20 to 80 % by .wt (b) water in an amount of 5 to 30 % by wt. (c) selective non-ionic emulsifier(s) having HLB in the range of 10-19 in amounts of 1 to 25% by wt. and (d) selective anionic emulsifier having HLB In the range of 8 - 19 in an amount of 1 to 15 % by. wt.;<br>
ii) homogenizing the mix of (i) using standard homognizer and maintaining a temperature of up to 50°C preferably In the range of 10-40°C such as to favour organopolysiloxane polymer growth rate or rise in polymer viscosity to at least 20000 cps; and Hi) neutralising the emulsion by alkali to a pH range 6-8.<br>
Importantly, it is found by way of the invention that one of the critical aspects which enable obtaining of emulsion up to 150 nanometer following a simple process is the selective use of a combination of non-ionic emulsifier together with an atleast one anionic emulsifier to achieve the desired particle sized emulsion. For organopolysiloxane emulsion, HLB value near to 12-15 is found to be the optimum value of the emulsifier or a mixture of emulsifiers, which help to make low particle emulsion. It is also found that a mixture of non-ionic and anionic emulsifiers having HLB value of the mixture near to 12-15 shows optimum combinations to make low particle stable emulsion with a standard homogenizer.<br>
3<br><br>
Also the quantity of the emulsifiers used in the above selective formulation have selective contribution to make the emulsion stable. In particular, in the above process of making low particle organopolysiloxane emulsion, the emulsion is also stabilized by use of surfactants having critical HLB values that help to make faster low particle emulsion by using standard homogenizer without need for complex ultra high pressure homogeniser.<br>
Moreover, it is also important to control temperature for achieving low particle size with narrow distribution of the particle. Advantageously making of the emulsion with a temperature up to 50°C, is found to further help faster polymer growth of organopolysiloxane in the emulsion. Temperature during the emulsion preparation is found to have great importance not only to control the particle size but also control the particle size distribution and faster growth of internal phase viscosity.<br>
In the above process of invention, preferably, a suitable biocide is added for preventing microbial growth.<br>
Since, the process uses a mixture of surfactants for making low particle organopolysiloxane by using standard homogenizer, it is important to maintain the selective formulation involving making a proper recipe of surfactants mix and recipe of organopolisiloxane and surfactants to achieve particle size up to 150 nanometer.<br>
In accordance with a preferred aspect the above process for the manufacture of stable and faster production of low particle size emulsion having high internal phase oil viscosity comprises of:<br>
(i) providing a selective formulation comprising providing water in an amount of 5 to 30% of the emulsion, 8 to 30% mixed emulsifiers comprising atleast one anionic emulsifier and at least one non-ionic emulsifier having HLB value of the emulsifiers in the range of 10-19 and an organopolysiloxane or mixture of organopolysiloxanes in the range of 20-80% of the emulsion.<br>
(ii) homogenising the mix with standard homogenizer while maintaining a temperature in the range up to 50°C, preferably in the range of 20-40°C for a period of 10 minutes to 2 hr depending on the desired characteristics of the emulsion ;<br>
(iii) allowing the emulsion to age in the range of 5 to 30°C to favour faster growth of -viscosity of the internal phase oil;<br>
4<br><br>
(iv) neutralising the emulsion with alkali and finally adding biocide for microbial prevention in the emulsion.<br>
The temperature of the material can be controlled during homogenising by passing cool water. In the above process the desired ageing temperature for growth of very high internal oil viscosity is in the range of 5 to 30 °C Generally, 1 to 12 hr is required to achieve very high viscosity internal phase oil viscosity. If internal oil viscosity is needed less than 500,000 cps, then neutralizing of the emulsion is carried out immediately after completion of mixing. Moreover, it is found that desired mixing time also varies for target viscosity of the polymer and distribution of the particles-in the emulsion.<br>
Neutralise the emulsion after completion of dilution steps. Generally, water-soluble inorganic alkali hydroxide or organic amine alcohol is used for neutralization. Preferably, sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide or triethanol amine is used to neutralise the<br>
emulsion.<br>
According to the present invention, one of the critical parameters include the selection of the right emulsifiers and combination of the emulsifiers to achieve the desired low particle size emulsion. The present invention thus achieves producing low particle emulsion in a simple way where selective emulsifier combination and temperature of emuIsification and polymerisation which have a critical part to make the process simple and avoiding the use of cost extensive and complex machinery.<br>

Quantity used in the emulsion must be controlled carefully, otherwise gellation of the polymer may occur during emulsion process and emulsion destabilizes. If branched polysiloxane is not required, the silane addition is avoided.<br>
According to the present invention, anionic emulsifier has an important role for simple and faster emulsion process of high internal phase viscosity emulsion having particle size up to 150 nm. Anionic surfactant is selected from organic sulfonic adds. Most common sulfonic a acids used in the present process are alkyl aryl sulfonic add; alkyl aryl polyoxyethylene sulphonic acid; alkyl sulfonic add and alkyl polyoxyethylene sulfonic acid. Structures of sulfonic adds are as below:<br>

Generally, 1 to 15% anionic surfactant is used in the present emulsion processing process. Preferably, 3- 10% anionic surfactant is used in the present emulsion to get the optimum result. Anionic surfactant has a dual role in the present emulsion process. Anionic surfactant acts as a condensation/ring opening catalyst in together with as a surfactant for emulsion making. Thus, by using anionic emulsifier, process doesnt need any catalyst for polymer growth of organopolysiloxane during emulsion process.<br>
8<br><br>
It is also observed according to the present invention, at least one additional emulsifier together with anionic emulsifier is essential alongwith the controlled temperature of emulsification and polymerisation for making the emulsion in a simple faster way. It is specially found by way of the present invention that at least one non-ionic emulsifier in together with anionic surfactant helps for faster simple emulsion production. Non-ionic emulsifiers having HLB value in between 10-19 are suitable to make the emulsion process simpler. Most useful surfactants of this category are polyoxyalkylene alkyl ether, polyoxyalkylene alkyl phenyl ethers and polyoxyalkylene sorbitan esters. Some useful surfactants having HLB value in between 10-19 are polyethylene glycol octyl ether; Polyethylene glycol lauryl ether; Polyethylene glycol tridecyl ether;-Polyethylene glycol cetyl ether; Polyethylene glycol stearyl ether; polyethylene glycol nonylphenyl ether; polyethylene glycol dodecylphenyl ether; polyethylene glycol cetylphenyl ether; polyethylene glycol staerylphenyl ether; polyethylene glycol sorbitan mono stearate and polyethylene glycol sorbitan mono oleate. Non-ionic surfactant having HLB value in-between 10-19 has a great importance in the present invention to make process more simpler.<br>
Generally, 1 to 25% nonionic surfactant is used in the emulsion processing process. Preferably, 5- 20% nonionic surfactant is used in the present emulsion to get the optimum result. It is well known in the art that Surfactant(s) having HLB value in-between 12-15 is useful to make organopolysiloxane emulsion by using standard homogenizer in shorter period and it is also well known to use a mixture of surfactants that have HLB value in-between 12-15 to get an emulsion of organopolysiloxane having long stability.<br>
According to the present invention, it is also important to provide selective formulation of the emulsifiers in a ratio such that the mix has HLB value preferably in-between 12-15 with at least one anionic surfactant and one non-ionic surfactant in the mixture.<br>
An important aspect in the present emulsion process is the selective use of a mixture of surfactants, which not only make stable emulsion in faster way by using standard homogenizer but also to produce a low particle emulsion up to 150 nm. Particle size of the emulsion is highly dependent on the ratio of anionic and non-ionic emulsifier (s) having HLB value of the mixture in-between 12-15.<br>
9<br><br>
It is also well known of the art that polymer growth rate of the orgaoplylsiloxane is also highly dependent on the particle size of the emulsion. So polymer growth rate of the organopolysiloxane during the emulsion process is much higher compared to organopolysiloxane emulsion having particle size above 150 nm.<br>
According to the present invention, the temperature during the emulsion process has an important role to control the particle size of the emulsion, distribution of the particle size distribution (i.e polydispersibility, value 1 is poor and value 0.1 or less than 0.1 is very good) and polymer growth rate of the organopolysiloxane during emulsion process. It is also observed in the present emulsion process, particle size, and distribution of the particle and polymer viscosity become out of control if temperature is not maintained within a selective limit. It is found a significant deviation of final emulsion specifications take place where temperature control is not within the said selective range even though emulsion is produced by using an optimum combination of emulsifiers with a proper combination of fluid to emulsifier. Maintaining a temperature below of 50°C is useful to control the particle size, distribution of particle in the emulsion and polymer growth rate of the organopolysiloxane in the emulsion.<br>
Further, it is also important to control the emulsion temperature during the ageing of the emulsion in case of ultra high (more than 2 million cps) organopolysiloxane polymer in the emulsion. A temperature below of 30°C is useful to make the polymerisation faster in case of ultra high organopolysiloxane polymer required in the inner phase of the emulsion. Emulsion polymerisation is significantly dropped if temperature is more than 30°C during ageing process, even difficult to achieve ultra high viscosity at high temperature. So, it is dear that faster completion of emulsion process for high organopolysiloxane polymer to ultra high polymer emulsion by emulsion polymerisation process, temperature has great role during the emulsion making process and during the ageing process. So, according to the present process, a combination of mixed emulsifiers having HLB value 12 -15 (contains atleast one anionic emulsifier and atleast one nonionic emulsifiers) in together with temperature control during emulsion making and during ageing helps the emulsion process useful to produce emulsion below 150 nm by standard homogenizer.<br>
The components are homogenised by standard homogenizers. Useful standard shear stirring system may be used such as conventional single stage stator-rotor homogeniser or other types of standard homogeniser which are used in the normal homogenising process. Homogenising can be carried out in batch or continuous depend on the design of emulsion process. From the capital investment point of view, it is also clear that the<br>
10<br><br>
process also needs a economic homogenising system and avoids the use of the expensive very high pressure homogenising system.<br>
Importantly, it is found by way of the present invention that the emulsion obtained following the process of the invention was highly stable .In particular, tests revealed that when the emulsion obtained was put in the oven in the range of 45 to 60°C and most preferably, 55°C for one month, no creaming or separation or deformation in the emulsion was observed. A study of 12 hr freeze/thaw cycles in 10°C/50°C temperature for one month also showed no creaming or separation or deformation in the emulsion.<br>
The details of the invention, its objects and advantages are explained hereunder in greater detail in relation to non- limiting exemplary illustrations of the process:<br>
EXAMPLES : Example I<br>
In the emulsion process, transferred 4.5 kg linear alkyl benzene sulfonic acid, 7 Kg tridecyl alcohol ethoxylate having HLB value 14, 4.5 Kg water in a 100 lit mixing tank having cold water jacket. Mixed the components for 5 mm. Added 31.22 Kg Wacker PDM siloxane (a 40 Cps alpha omega hydroxy terminated polydimethyl siloxane) and mixed the component by single stage stator-rotor homogeniser till particle size dropped to 70nm. Mixing was continued for 25 min to reach particle size 70nm. During mixing, temperature of the components were maintained below 30°C.

Above results clearly demonstrate the findings under the invention that organopolysiloxane emulsion having particle size below is only possible to produce by simple single stage stator-rotor homogeniser when emulsifier mixture comprises atleast one anionic emulsifiers and-atfeast one non-ionic emulstfiers.-Anionic emulsifiers or a mixture of anionic emulsifier can not produce an organopolysiloxane emulsion below 150 nm by using simple homogeniser. According to the present invention, it is also clearly understood that temperature control during emulsion process has an important role to control the particle size, polydispersibility of the emulsion particles and polymer growth rate. It also observed in the examples that when same recipe followed with out controlling the temperature, emulsion produced in the process had worse result in compare to the emulsion produced with same recipe at controlled temperature during the emulsion process. It is observed that low ageing temperature for ultra high polymer also enhances the polymer growth rate in-compare to ageing at higher temperature. Also the above results further demonstrate that particle size below 150 nm has a substantial influence in the faster organopolysiloxane polymer growth in compare of silicone emulsion having particle size more than 150 nm.<br>

A process for making stable high viscosity organopolysiloxane emulsion having particle size up to 150 nanometer and in particular to an emulsion-polymerization process involving a simple and cost-effective fester completion of emulsification of organopolysiloxane by using standard homogenizer and also subsequent polymerization of the organopolysiloxane at controlled temperature. The process involves a selective combination of non-ionic emulsifier together with an at least one anionic emulsifier to achieve the desired particle size emulsion. Importantly, the selective mix of non-ionic and anionic emulsifiers having HLB value of the mixture near to 12-15 and maintaining a temperature of up to 50°C is found to favour obtaining low particle stable emulsion with any standard homogeniser avoiding need for high pressure homogenizing.<br></td>
