				<td>Labelling board for transport and storage containers for liquids<br>
and bulk material<br>
The invention concerns a labelling board for transport and storage containers for liquids and bulk material, that is fitted with a plastic inner container with a closable filler opening and an outlet opening with a discharge fitting, with a pallet-like base to support the inner container as well as with a grate jacket fastened on the base, said grate jacket comprising horizontal and vertical metal grate bars to support the filled inner container, whereby the grate bars are welded together at the points of intersection and the sheet metal labelling board with limited flexibility is secured on the grate jacket.<br>
Such transport and storage containers for liquids and bulk material, described also as pallet containers, are generally known in various executions. In the case of these pallet containers usually a labelling board is fastened on the grate jacket at the front where the discharge fitting is provided, to this labelling board an appropriate information sheet or several data sheets are adhered containing data regarding the material filled, the manufacturer of the material filled, the manufacturer of the pallet container, the permit number and similar data or the information sheet is inserted into a see-through pouch glued on,<br>
DE 195 37 490 CI describes a labelling board of the generic type for pallet containers with a metal grate jacket of horizontal and vertical grate bars constructed from round tubes, the grate bars tapered at the points of intersection to form double-walled troughÂ¬like recesses extending in the longitudinal direction of the grate bars in such a manner, that the grate bars welded together at the points of intersection are situated almost in one plane. The labelling board, fastened on the grate jacket, has a bottom outward turned or flanged supporting edge that abuts against a lower horizontal grate bar and engages it from behind, while the top edge, constructed as a claw edge, in the installed state of the labelling board engages from behind an upper grate bar while resiliently tensioning the labelling board. According to a further embodiment of this known labelling board it has laterally at the top on the external edges special insertion sleeves for plastic clamping pins, which in the assembled state of the board engage with their heads the trough-like recesses of the upper horizontal grate bar and secure the board in this manner. To ensure the original state a plastic push-button with expanding key-like<br><br>
flange and film-hinge locks is used, that is pressed into a corresponding recess on the top edge of the sheet metal board.<br>
The known pallet containers, that are used to store and transport liquid goods of all kind of the chemical, pharmaceutical, mineral oil and foodstuff industries, have the disadvantage that when being transported by trucks in the case of a distortion of the loading platform, occurring when travelling over hills or uneven surfaces on the roadway, and when due to the vibration of the transport vehicle two adjacent pallet containers will move relative one another, the label adhered to the labelling board of a pallet container will be abraded by the grate bars of the adjacent pallet container and made illegible.<br>
The object of the invention is to further develop the construction of the generic type labelling board for transport and storage containers for liquids with regard to an optimum protection of the label adhered to the labelling area of the board against external forces, in particular during transport as well as to a simplified installation.<br>
This objective is achieved according to the invention by a labelling board having the features of patent claim 1.<br>
The sub-claims contain advantageous and appropriate further developments of the invention.<br>
The labelling board according to the invention embodies a simple and useful solution of the task set.<br>
The invention is explained in the following based on the figures of the drawing, illustrating the following in:<br>
Fig.1 - a perspective illustration of a transport and storage container for liquids with a<br>
labelling board, Fig.2 - the front view of the labelling board, enlarged,<br>
Figs.3 to 6 - enlarged cross-sectional views according to the lines Ill-Ill to Vl-VI of Fig.2,<br><br>
Fig.7 - an enlarged partial cross-section of two labelling boards, with their top frame sections abutting against one another,<br>
Fig.8 - an enlarged lateral view of the labelling board in the direction of arrow VIII of Fig.2, and<br>
Figs.9a to 9d - the Installation of the labelling board according to Figs.2 and 8 on the grate jacket of a pallet container in four successive steps.<br>
The transport and storage container 1 for liquids according to Fig.1, that can be used as a single-use and multi-use container, is constructed as a pallet container and as main components has a replaceable parallelepiped-shaped plastic inner container 2 with a front wall 3, a rear wall 4 and two lateral walls 5, 6, a bottom end 7 constructed as draining bottom and a top end 8, a filler socket 9 moulded on the top end that can be closed with a lid 10 and an outlet socket 12 moulded on a depression 11 in the bottom section of the front wall 3 of the inner container 2, the outlet socket integrally produced with the inner container 2 by blow moulding to connect a discharge fitting 13, furthermore an outer jacket constructed as a grate jacket 14 with intersecting horizontal and vertical tubular metal grate rods 15, 16 welded together at crossing points 17 to accommodate the inner container 2, as well as a pallet-like base 18 having longitudinal and lateral dimensions to European standards to support the inner container 2.<br>
The sheet metal labelling board 20 with limited flexibility according to Figs.2 to 8, that is to be fastened on the outside 19 of the grate jacket 14 of the transport container 1, has a top and bottom frame section 21, 22 as well as two lateral frame sections 23, 24, which protrude outward past the labelling area 25 of the labelling board 20 and provide a frame for the labelling area. The labelling board 20 has two further inward bevelled or flanged lateral edges 26, 27 with a top and bottom outward directed edge section 28, 29 formed as a cylinder, as well as a top upward directed opening 30, a central inward facing opening 31 and a bottom downward directed opening 32, while the top edge section 28 of both lateral edges 26, 27 protrudes upward past the top opening 30 in the lateral edges and the bottom edge section 29 of both lateral edges 26, 27 protrudes downward past the bottom opening 32 in the lateral edges.<br><br>
In the installed state of the labelling board 20 Its top and bottom frame sections 21, 22 lie against an upper and a lower horizontal grate bar 15b, 15a of the grate jacket 14, the labelling board 20 with the top, central and bottom openings 30, 31, 32 of both lateral edges 26, 27 lie against an upper, a central and a lower horizontal grate bar 15b, 15c, 15a while flexibly braced, the top and bottom edge sections 28, 29 of both lateral edges 26, 27 of the labelling board 20 engage from behind the upper and lower horizontal grate bars 15b, 15a and both lateral edges 26, 27 of the labelling board 20 with their top and bottom edge sections 28, 29 abut against a vertical grate bar 16 each of the grate jacket 14.<br>
The top and bottom frame section 21, 22 of the labelling board 20 are made rigid by doubling the sheet metal material.<br>
Both lateral frame sections 23, 24 of the labelling board 20 are interrupted in its central section 33.<br>
The four corners 34-37 of the rectangular labelling board 20 are fitted with an edge protector, that is formed by rounded transitions 38-41 between the top and bottom frame sections 21, 22 as well as the lateral frame sections 23, 24.<br>
In each of the central section 42 of both lateral edges 26, 27 a clamp 43 is formed for the purpose of fastening the labelling board 20 on the horizontal central grate bar 15c, while the clamps 43 hav/e a slotted fastening sleeve 44 formed on the lateral edges on the circumference of the central opening 31 of both lateral edges 26, 27 of the labelling board 20 to place it on the horizontal central grate bar 15c and two clamping tabs 45, 46 of different lengths are formed opposite one another on the fastening sleeve 44. For the fastening of the labelling board 20 on the horizontal central grate bar 15c the long clamping tab 45 of both clamps 43 is bent around the grate rod 15c against the short clamping tab 46 and clinched with it.<br>
The top and bottom frame section 21, 22 of the labelling board 20 have embossed impressions 47 for reinforcement.<br><br>
The labelling board 20 has a blanked out slot 48, that in the case of being covered by a transponder 49 with the data stored for the identification of the contents of the container adhered to the labelling area 25, acts as an antenna amplifier.<br>
Fig.2 shows the labelling board 20 with written placards 50 of various formats, also described as labels, adhered to the labelling area 25 of the labelling board.<br>
Fig.7 illustrates the distancing of the labelling boards 20 of two transport containers standing next to one another on one loading platform by the frame sections 21-24 of the labelling boards, that prevent a contact of the labelling areas 25 of the labelling boards and consequently a damaging of the placards 50 adhered to the labelling areas 25 of the boards.<br>
When the labelling board 20 is installed on the grate jacket 14 of the transport and storage container 1 illustrated in Figs.9a-9d, according to Fig.Qa the labelling board 20 is first placed with the bottom openings 32 in both lateral edges 26, 27 in a slightly inclined position in the direction of arrow a onto the lower horizontal grate bar 15a, while the lower trapezoid-shaped frame section 22 abuts against the outside of the grate bar 15a and the lower rolled edge section 29 of both lateral edges 26, 27 of the labelling board 20 engage from behind the lower horizontal grate bar 15a and come to rest on two vertical grate rods 16 spaced from one another according to the spacing of the grate of the grate jacket 14. Following this, according to Fig.9b the upper half 51 of the labelling board 20 is so far bent inward in the direction of arrow b, that the top frame section 21 of the labelling board comes to rest on the upper horizontal grate bar 15b and the top openings 30 of both lateral edges 26, 27 of the labelling board 20 take up a position below the upper horizontal grate bar 15b. Aften/vards, according to Fig.9c the labelling board 20 is pressed with its rear side 52 in the direction of arrow c against the central horizontal grate bar 15c. By doing so, while flexibly bracing the labelling board 20, the top openings 30 of both lateral edges 26, 27 of the labelling board 20 snap onto the upper horizontal grate bar 15b, while the top frame section 21 slides further on the upper horizontal grate bar 15b and the central openings 31 of both lateral edges 26, 27 as well as the slotted fastening sleeves 44 of both clamps 43 of the labelling board 20 will engage the central horizontal grate bar 15c. Finally, according to Fig.9d the long clamping tabs 45 of both clamps 43 of the labelling board 20 are bent around the central<br><br>
grate bar 15c in the direction of arrow d against the short clamping tabs 46 and the clamping tabs 45, 46 of both clamps 43 are clinched with one another, so that a secure fastening of the labelling board 20 is assured on the grate jacket 14 of the transport and storage container 1.<br><br>
