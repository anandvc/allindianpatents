Moringa oleifera Lam is a tree yielding edible fruits. Traditionally extracts of leaves of Moringa oleifera has been used against microbial infections. Glucosinolates and phenolics extracted from vegetative and reproductive tissues inhibited the growth of Helicobacter sp. (US Patent 6737441). Nitrile glycosides isolated from Moringa oleifera has enhanced the bioactivity of antibiotics against gram positive and negative bacteria (US Patent 6858588). Herbal formulations where Moringa oleifera is also a component has been shown to be active against skin disorders (US Patent 6383495). And thiocarbamates like Niazimin isolated from the leaves of Moringa oleifera has been shown to inhibit tumor induction by compounds like teleocidin in Raji cells. (Murakami et al 1998 ; Guevara et al, 1999 ). Also polysaccharides extracted from edible fungi like Flammulina velutipes, Leutinus edodes and Agaricus bisporus inhibited mitosis of hepatoma cells from 51.9 % to 56.6% (Jiang, 1999 ). The large scale preparation of oligosaccharide phosphate (predominantly a penta maiman) from the fungus Pichia holstii using acid hydrolysis has been reported (Ferro et al 2001). J.P-06-329514 informs the preparation of leachates or extraction of various plants including Moringa towards the use as pest controlling agent. J.P-07-304685 describes the preparation of active ingredients as a methanol extract from M oleifera which gives thiocarbamates and its glycosides.<br>
Though a variety of phenolic compounds are being used as anticancer drugs, many tumor cells have already developed resistance. Therefore there is a need to invent new drugs from natural sources. The composition of polysaccharides from different plants and fimgi are different in their ability to form bioactive secondary structure which not only depends on its monomer composition but also the freedom of their movement which eventually determine their bioactive structure. The structure activity relationship (SAR) plays an important role in their therapeutic value.<br><br>
Summary of the Prior art:<br>
Extraction of different compounds like thiocarbamates and their derivatives, phenols, glycosides especially rhanmosyl glycosides from Moringa oleifera has been reported earlier. A variety of solvents like water, methanol, ethanol and lipid solvent were used to extract compounds and their use for a variety of ailments were reported.<br>
Objectives of the present invention<br>
To prepare bionanoparticles of Moringa oleifera measuring less than 150 nm and an ability to protect DNA, RNA, to inhibit cell division in Onion root and human Carcinoma cells.<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
Bionanoparticles of Moringa oleifera measuring less than 150nm were prepared from the soft fibres through controlled hydrolysis, selective size fractionation by ultrafiltration and particle preparation by spray drying. The bioactivity of bionanoparticles was elucidated.<br>
4.        Description of the invention<br>
•	10 grams of Moringa gum powder was washed with 20ml of diethyl either, 20ml of chloroform : Methanol (2:1) 20ml of 50% Methanol with 20ml of 100% ethanol and dried<br>
•	Extract of purified Moringa gum of step 1 made aqueous (100mg/ml) was taken in a Sahxlet apparatus and treated with HCl to give a final concentration of 0.5N and 60 minutes at 100°C.<br>
•	The acid hydrolysed polysaccharides were brought to 25°C and IM NaHCO3 solution was added to give a final concentration of 0.1 M.<br>
•	The cooled suspension was filtered through either 0.22 micron filters or through a ultra filtration membranes with a cut off molecular weight of 3000 daltons.<br>
•	The bionanoparticles measuring 60nm to 100nm were prepared by spray drying at 100°C.<br><br>
Moringa bionanoparticle prepared was viewed under the atomic force microscope and the image is presented in Fig 1. The nanoparticles were between 60nm to 100 nm.<br>
The bioactivity of the bionanoparticles was ascertained.<br>
Advantages of the invention:<br>
Bionanoparticles from Moringa oleifera oligosaccharides measuring less than 150 nm were prepared.  These bionanoparticles have the utility of protecting plasmid DNA and bacterial RNA from degradation; inhibits cell division of Onion root tips and also malignant cell lines like HEp-2 cells. Example 1:<br>
Effect of Moringa bionanoparticles on plasmid DNA and RNA.<br>
•	1.5 ml of bacterial culture was taken in two eppendorffs and centrifuged for 1 minute,<br>
•	the pellet was suspended in 350 μl of STET (O.IM NaCl, 10mM Tris.Cl (PH 8), 5% Triton x 100, ImM EDTA),<br>
•	25 μl of Lysozyme was added to each tube and inverted once and then kept in boiling water bath for 40 seconds,<br>
•	immediately centrifuged at 10,000xg at room temperature for 15 minutes,<br>
•	saved the supernatant,<br>
•	added 40μl of sodium acetate (3 M pH 5.2) and 420 μl isopropanol and 100 μl of nanoparticle (Img/ml concentration) and mixed well,<br>
•	centrifuged at 10,000 xg for 15 minutes at room temperature,<br>
•	the pellet was saved and washed with 70% ethanol and the<br>
•	pellet was suspended in 25μl  of TE (10mM Tris.Cl (pH8) and ImM EDTA) and incubated at room temperature.<br>
•	0.7% agarose gel was used to check the presence of DNA and RNA for various time periods upto 44 hours.<br><br>
The bionanoparticles protected plasmid DNA and bacterial RNA (Fig. 2).<br>
Explanation to Fig. 2 : Lanel shows the Hindlll cut lambda DNA used as marker. Lane 2 shows the degradation of plasmid DNA and E.coli RNA in room temperature after 44 hrs of incubation. Lane3 shows the protection of plasmid DNA and E.coli RKA by bionanoparticles for a period of 44 hrs.<br>
Example 2:<br>
Influence of Moringa bionanoparticles on H£p2 cells.<br>
•	HEp-2 cells were subcultured (2x104 cells/ml) and allowed to attain a confluent growth.<br>
•	Before the addition of bionanoparticles the medium was changed and fresh medium was added (3ml).<br>
•	50μl of bionanoparticles (30mg/ml) was added to the plate and incubated at 37°C and after 12 hours the cells were observed under the microscope.<br>
The normal Hep2 cells are shown in Fig. 3 . The Hep2 cells treated with bionanoparticles are shown in Fig 4. The treated cells, show blebbing which eventually leads to apoptosis and death. This indicates the ability of Moringa bionanoparticles to arrest the growth of human epidermoid carcinoma cells.<br><br>
