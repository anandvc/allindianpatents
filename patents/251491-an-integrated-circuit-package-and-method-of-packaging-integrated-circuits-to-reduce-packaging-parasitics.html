INTEGRATED CIRCUIT PACKAGING<br>
[0001] This application claims priority under 35 U.S.C. 119(e) to Provisional U.S. Patent Application No. 60/700,143 filed July 18, 2005, the entire contents of which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0002] The disclosure relates to integrated circuit packaging and, more particularly, methods of reducing packaging parasitics for die-mounted integrated circuits.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0003] In an integrated circuit package, a die having multiple electrically conductive die terminals is typically mounted on a surface of a lead frame. The lead frame includes a central ground paddle surrounded by input/output ("I/O") circuit pads positioned on the surface of the lead frame near the outer perimeter of the lead frame. The die terminals may be electrically connected to the I/O circuit pads on the surface of the lead frame using electrically conductive bond wires. Some of the die terminals may be electrically connected to I/O circuit pads and/or ground circuit paddles using downbonds, thereby providing electrical or logical signal routing and connectivity between the die terminals on a top surface of the lead frame, and ground attachment paddles and/or I/O circuit pads on a bottom surface of the lead frame.<br>
[0004] As die and package sizes of integrated circuits have been reduced, there have been recent efforts to mount several dies on a single lead frame. In addition, as the functions of integrated circuits have become increasingly complex, the number of die terminals on the lead frame has increased dramatically, leading to a dramatic increase in the number of ground circuit pads and I/O circuit pads required to provide an electrical connection from the bottom surface to the top surface of the lead frame. In addition, the number of bond wires and downbonds has also increased, creating longer wire runs to connect the die terminals to a common ground attachment paddle. Electrical noise, such as noise caused by parasitic inductance or capacitance, often arises when the bond wire runs become too long.<br><br>
WO 2007/011767	PCT/US2006/027462<br><br>
SUMMARY<br>
[0005] In general, this disclosure is directed to integrated circuit packages and methods of packaging integrated circuits to reduce packaging parasitics. More specifically, the disclosure is directed to techniques for reducing integrated circuit packaging parasitics by decreasing the length of bond wires extending across or through the surface of an integrated circuit packaging lead frame, or by decreasing the number of downbonds. [0006] In one embodiment, the disclosure provides an integrated circuit package including a lead frame having multiple I/O pads positioned proximate to the perimeter of the lead frame around a central ground paddle. An integrated circuit die having electrically conductive die terminals is positioned on the central ground paddle, and electrically conductive I/O circuit pads are arranged about the die between the I/O pads and the die, each I/O circuit pad electrically connected to one of the I/O pads. Electrically conductive ground circuit pads, electrically connected to the central ground paddle, are also positioned around the die on the central ground paddle between the die and the I/O circuit pads. Electrically conductive bond wires connect one or more of the die terminals to one or more I/O circuit pads or one or more ground circuit pads. [0007] In certain exemplary embodiments, the disclosure further provides an integrated circuit positioned to engage the integrated circuit die in electrical connection with the die terminals. In some embodiments, one or more bond wires may also connect between an I/O circuit pad and a ground circuit pad.<br>
[0008] In another embodiment, the disclosure provides an integrated circuit including a logic circuit having a plurality of logic gates positioned to communicably engage die terminals of an integrated circuit die. The die has a plurality of electrically conductive die terminals and is positioned on the central ground paddle of a lead frame. The lead frame includes I/O pads positioned proximate to the perimeter of the lead frame around the central ground paddle. Electrically conductive I/O circuit pads are also arranged about the die between the die and the I/O pads, each I/O circuit pad electrically connected to one of the I/O pads. Electrically conductive ground circuit pads, electrically connected to the central ground paddle, are also positioned around the die between the die and the I/O circuit pads. Electrically conductive bond wires connect one or more of the die terminals to one or more I/O circuit pads or one or more ground<br><br>
WO 2007/011767	PCT/US2006/027462<br>
circuit pads. In some embodiments, one or more bond wires may also connect between an I/O circuit pad and a ground circuit pad.<br>
[0009] In a further embodiment, the disclosure provides a method for packaging an integrated circuit. The method includes mounting an integrated circuit die including multiple electrically conductive die terminals to a central ground paddle on a lead frame. The lead frame includes electrically conductive I/O pads positioned around the central ground paddle proximate to the outer perimeter of the lead frame. The method further includes forming electrically conductive I/O circuit pads about the die between the I/O pads and the die, each I/O circuit pad electrically connected to one of the I/O pads. The method also includes forming electrically conductive ground circuit pads in electrica} connection with the central ground paddle around the die between the die and the I/O circuit pads, and further includes electrically connecting an .electric ally conductive bond wire between each of the die terminals and one or more of the I/O circuit pads or the ground circuit pads.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTI/ON<br>
[0016] FIG 1 is a schematic side view diagram illustrating an integrated circuit package 100 including a lead frame 101 having a plurality of I/O pads 103 positioned around a central ground paddle 107 proximate to the outer perimeter of the lead frame 101. An integrated circuit die 102 including a plurality of electrically conductive die terminals 104 is mounted to the central ground paddle 107 with a bonding layer 105, and electrically conductive I/O circuit pads 106 are arranged about the die 102, each circuit pad 106 being positioned on and electrically connected to one of the I/O pads 103. Electrically conductive ground circuit pads 110, electrically connected to the central ground paddle 107, are positioned around the die 102 between the die 102 and the I/O circuit pads 106. Electrically conductive bond wires 108 connect one or more of the die terminals 104 to one or more I/O circuit pads 106, or one or more ground circuit pads 110.<br>
[0017] In some embodiments (not illustrated in FIG. 1), one or more bond wires 108 may connect between an I/O circuit pad 106 and a ground circuit pad 110. A multi-pin integrated circuit 114 may be mounted on the die 102 in communicable engagement with the die terminals 104. A mold compound 112 may overlay the lead frame 101, encapsulating and insulating one or more of the die 102, the bond wires 108, the ground circuit pads 110 and the I/O circuit pads 106. The mold compound may optionally overlay the multi-pin integrated circuit 114 as shown in FIG. 1, encapsulating and insulating the integrated circuit.<br>
[0018] Fig. 2 is a schematic top partial view diagram of an integrated circuit package 200 including a lead frame 201 having a plurality of I/O pads 203 positioned around a central ground paddle 207 proximate to the outer perimeter of the lead frame 201. An integrated circuit die 202, including a plurality of electrically conductive die terminals 204, is mounted to the central ground paddle 207, and electrically conductive I/O circuit pads 206 are arranged about the die 202, each circuit pad 206 being positipned on and electrically connected to one of the I/O pads 203. Electrically conductive ground circuit pads 210, electrically connected to the central ground paddle 207, are positioned around the die 202 between the die 202 and the I/O circuit pads 206. Electrically conductive bond wires 208 connect one or more of the die terminals 204 to one or more I/O circuit pads 206, or one or more ground circuit pads 210.<br><br>
WO 2007/011767	PCT/US2006/027462<br>
[0019] In some embodiments, a multi-pin integrated circuit (not shown in FIG. 2) may be mounted on the die 202 in communicable engagement with the die terminals 204. In certain embodiments, at least two bond wires 208 electrically connect to a single ground circuit pad 210'. In certain other embodiments, a corner ground pad 214 is positioned proximate to a corner of the lead frame 201 and connected to the central ground paddle 207 by a corner ground circuit pad 210". In other exemplary embodiments, the integrated circuit package 200 may be constructed to reduce the length of the bond wires 208 between the die terminals 204 of the integrated circuit die 202, and the ground circuit pads 210 positioned on and electrically connected to the central ground paddle 207 of the lead frame 201, thereby reducing the parasitic inductance associated with the bond wires 208 connected to the ground circuit pads 210. <br>
[0020] In the particular embodiment illustrated in FIG. 2, the lead frame 201 and integrated circuit die 202 are both generally rectangular in shape, and the die terminals 204 are arrayed about the perimeter of the generally rectangular shaped integrated circuit die 202. In this particular embodiment, the I/O circuit pads 206 are arrayed about the generally rectangular perimeter of the lead frame 201 proximate to the edges of the lead frame. The particular embodiment of .an integrated circuit package illustrated in FIG. 2 illustrates the arrangement of ground circuit pads 210 in a linear array around the integrated circuit die 202 between the die 202 and I/O circuit pads 206 along the edges of the generally rectangular perimeter of the central ground paddle 207. Although other arrangements of ground circuit pads 210 are within the scope of the present disclosure, the arrangement illustrated in FIG. 2 may be suitable for packaging a single, generally rectangular integrated circuit on a generally rectangular lead frame 201.<br>
[0021] FIG. 3 is a schematic top partial view diagram of an integrated circuit package 300 including a lead frame 301 having a plurality of I/O pads 303 positioned around a central ground paddle 307 proximate to the outer perimeter of the lead frame 301. Integrated circuit package 300 is similar to integrated circuit package 200 of FIG. 2. However, integrated circuit package 300 illustrates use of multiple ground circuit pads 310 having a generally rectangular shape including a long dimension and a short dimension, wherein each of the long dimensions is oriented substantially orthogonal to at least one edge defined by the generally rectangular perimeter of the central ground paddle 307. The embodiment of FIG.3 is thus adapted for use with a smaller integrated<br><br>
WO 2007/011767	PCT/US2006/027462<br>
circuit die 302 in a smaller integrated circuit package 300 relative to the integrated circuit package 200 of FIG. 2.<br>
[0022] Like integrated circuit package 200 of FIG. 2, integrated circuit package 300 has a lead frame 301 having a plurality of I/O pads 303 positioned around a central ground paddle 307 proximate to the outer perimeter of the lead frame 301. An integrated circuit die 302, including a plurality of electrically conductive die terminals 304, is mounted to the central ground paddle 307, and electrically conductive I/O circuit pads 306 are arranged about the die 302, each circuit pad 306 being positioned on and electrically connected to one of the I/O pads 303. Electrically conductive ground circuit pads 310, electrically connected to the central ground paddle 307, are positioned around the die 302 between the die 302 and the I/O circuit pads 306. Electrically conductive bond wires 308 connect one or more of the die terminals 304 to one or more I/O circuit pads 306, or one or more ground circuit pads 310.<br>
[0023] In some embodiments, a multi-pin integrated circuit (not shown in FIG. 3) may be mounted on the die 302 in communicable engagement with the die terminals 304. In certain embodiments, at least two bond wires 308 electrically connect to a single ground circuit pad 310'. In certain other embodiments, a corner ground pad 314 is positioned proximate to a corner of the lead frame 301 and connected to the central ground paddle 307 by a corner ground circuit pad 310". In additional exemplary embodiments, a corner ground circuit pad 310'" may be positioned proximate to a corner of the generally rectangular central ground paddle 307. In some exemplary embodiments, the integrated circuit package 300 may be constructed to reduce the length of the bond wires 308 between the die terminals 304 of the integrated circuit die 302, and the ground circuit pads 310 positioned on the central ground paddle 307 of the lead frame 301, thereby reducing the parasitic inductance associated with the ground bond wires 308.<br>
[0024] In the particular embodiment illustrated in FIG. 3, the lead frame 301 and integrated circuit die 302 are both generally rectangular in shape, and the die terminals 304 are arrayed about the perimeter of the generally rectangular shaped integrated circuit die 302. In this particular embodiment, the I/O circuit pads 306 are arrayed about the generally rectangular perimeter of the lead frame 301 proximate to the edges of the lead frame 301. The particular embodiment of an integrated circuit package 300 illustrated in FIG. 3 illustrates the arrangement of the ground circuit pads 310 in a linear<br><br>
WO 2007/011767	PCT/US2006/027462<br>
array around the integrated circuit die 302 between the die 302 and the plurality of I/O circuit pads 306 along at least one edge defined by the perimeter of the central ground paddle 307. Although other arrangements of the plurality of ground circuit pads 310 can be provided, the arrangement illustrated in FIG. 3 may be suitable for packaging a single, generally rectangular integrated circuit using a generally rectangular integrated circuit die 302 having a large number of die terminals 304, and positioned on the central ground paddle 307 of a generally rectangular lead frame 301. <br>
[0025] The structure shown in FIG. 3 may be especially useful for packaging of high density integrated circuits. In particular, the structure shown in FIG. 3 may be useful for packaging high density integrated circuits having five or more, more preferably seven or more, most preferably ten or more die terminals 304 per linear centimeter of perimeter of the integrated circuit die 302. In this particular embodiment, each of the ground circuit pads 310 has a generally rectangular shape including a long dimension and a short dimension, and each of the long dimensions of the generally rectangular shaped ground circuit pads 310 is oriented substantially orthogonal to at least one edge of the lead frame 301.<br>
[0026] FIG. 4 is a schematic top partial view diagram of an integrated circuit package 400 including a lead frame 401 having a plurality of I/O pads 403 positioned around a central ground paddle 407 proximate to the outer perimeter of the lead frame. Integrated circuit package 400 is similar to integrated circuit package 200 of FIG. 2. However, integrated circuit package 400 illustrates use of multiple ground circuit pads 410 having a generally trapezoidal shape including a long dimension and a short dimension, wherein at least one of the long dimensions forms an angle of ninety degrees or less with at least one edge defined by the generally rectangular perimeter of the central ground paddle 407. The embodiment of FIG. 4 is thus adapted for use with an integrated circuit die 402 having a large number of closely spaced die terminals 404, and/or a large number of closely spaced bond wires covering a comparable area of the lead frame relative to the integrated circuit package 200 of FIG. 2. <br>
[0027] Like integrated circuit package 200 of FIG. 2, integrated circuit package 400 has a<br>
lead frame 401 having a plurality of I/O pads 403 positioned around a central ground paddle 407 proximate to the outer perimeter of the lead frame 401. An integrated circuit die 402,.including a plurality of electrically conductive die terminals 404, is mounted to<br><br>
WO 2007/011767	PCT/US2006/027462<br><br>
the central ground paddle 407, and electrically conductive I/O circuit pads 406 are arranged about the die 402, each circuit pad 406 being positioned on and electrically connected to one of the I/O pads 403. Electrically conductive ground circuit pads 410, electrically connected to the central ground paddle 407, are positioned around the die 402 between the die 402 and the I/O circuit pads 406. Electrically conductive bond wires 408 connect one or more of the die terminals 404 to one or more I/O circuit pads 406, or one or more ground circuit pads 410.<br>
[0028] In some embodiments, a multi-pin integrated circuit (not shown in FIG. 4) may be mounted on the die 402 in communicable engagement with the die terminals 404. In certain exemplary embodiments, at least two bond wires 408 electrically connect to a single ground circuit pad 410'. In certain other embodiments, a corner ground pad 414 is positioned proximate to a corner of the lead frame 401 and connected to the central ground paddle 407 by a corner ground circuit pad 410". In additional exemplary embodiments, the integrated circuit package 400 may be constructed to reduce the length of the bond wires 408 between the die terminals 404 of the integrated circuit die 402, and the ground circuit pads 410 positioned on the central ground paddle 407 of the lead frame 401, thereby reducing the parasitic inductance associated with the ground bond wires 408.<br>
[0029] In the particular embodiment illustrated in FIG. 4, the lead frame 401 is generally rectangular in shape, and the die terminals 404 are arrayed about the perimeter of the generally rectangular shaped integrated circuit die 402. In this particular embodiment, the I/O circuit pads 406 are arrayed about the generally rectangular perimeter of the lead frame 401. The particular embodiment of an integrated circuit package illustrated in FIG. 4 illustrates the arrangement of the plurality of ground circuit pads 410 in a linear array around the integrated circuit die 402 between the die 402 and the I/O circuit pads 406 along one edge of the generally rectangular perimeter of central ground paddle 407. Although other arrangements of the ground circuit pads 410 are possible, the arrangement illustrated in FIG. 4 is an embodiment that may be suitable for packaging a single, generally rectangular integrated circuit using a generally rectangular integrated circuit die having a very large number of die terminals 404, and positioned on the central ground paddle 407 of a generally rectangular lead frame 401. <br>
[0030] The structure shown in FIG. 4 may be especially useful for packaging of very high density integrated circuits. In particular, the structure shown in FIG. 4 may be<br><br>
WO 2007/011767	PCT/US2006/027462<br>
useful for packaging very high density integrated circuits having ten or more, more preferably fifteen or more, most preferably twenty or more die terminals 404 per linear centimeter of perimeter of the integrated circuit die 402. In this particular embodiment, each of ground circuit pads 410 has a generally trapezoidal shape including a long dimension and a short dimension, and at least one long dimension of one or more of the generally trapezoidal shaped ground circuit pads 410 is oriented at an angle of ninety degrees or less relative to at least one of the edges defined by the generally rectangular perimeter of the central ground paddle 407. Ground circuit pads 410 may form a generally fan-like pattern about the integrated circuit die 402, as exemplified in FIG. 4. More particularly, each of the edges defining a generally rectangular perimeter of the central ground paddle 410' may join at least one other edge to form a corner, and each comer may be proximate to a generally trapezoidal shaped ground circuit pad oriented at an acute angle relative to the joined edges, as exemplified in FIG. 4. <br>
[0031] FIG. 4 also illustrates an embodiment in which the shape of the ground circuit pads 410 is varied from generally trapezoidal at the corners of the generally rectangular perimeter of lead frame 401, to a generally rectangular shape as the position of the ground'circuit pad 410 becomes closer to the integrated circuit die 402. Such an arrangement may substantially reduce the cumulative length of the ground bond wires 408 from running across the surface of the lead frame 401 from the die terminal 404 to the ground circuit pads 410, and thereby substantially reduce parasitic inductance for the integrated circuit package 400.<br>
[0032] FIG 5 is a schematic top partial view diagram of an integrated circuit package 500 including a lead frame 501 having a plurality of VO pads 503 positioned around a central ground paddle 507 proximate to the outer perimeter of the lead frame. Integrated circuit package 500 is similar to integrated circuit package 400 of FIG. 4. However, in addition to illustrating the use of multiple ground circuit pads 510 having a generally trapezoidal shape including a long dimension and a short dimension, wherein at least one of the long dimensions is oriented at an angle of ninety degrees or less relative to at least one edge defined by the generally rectangular perimeter of the central ground paddle 507, FIG. 5 also illustrates positioning of the ground circuit pads 510 closer to the die 502 in order to further reduce the lengths of the bond wires 508.   The embodiment of FIG. 4 is thus adapted for use with very small integrated circuit packages 500 including an integrated circuit die 402 having an extremely large number<br><br>
WO 2007/011767	PCT/US2006/027462<br>
