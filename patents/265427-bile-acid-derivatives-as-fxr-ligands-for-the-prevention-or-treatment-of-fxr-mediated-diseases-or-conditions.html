				<td>BILE ACID DERIVATIVES AS FXR LIGANDS FOR THE PREVENTION OR<br>
TREATMENT OF FXR-MEDIATED DISEASES OR CONDITIONS<br>
Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to Famesoid X receptor (FXR) modulators<br>
which can be used for the treatment of cholestatic disorders, in particular to bile acid<br>
derivatives wherein the C6 contains an ethyl and the C24 carboxy group is<br>
transformed into a sulphate group.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
Famesoid X Receptor (FXR) is an orphan nuclear receptor initially identified<br>
from a rat liver cDNA library (BM. Forman, et al., Cell 81:687-693 (1995)) that is<br>
most closely related to the insect ecdysone receptor. FXR is a member of the nuclear<br>
receptor family of ligand-activated transcription factors that includes receptors for<br>
the steroid, retinoid, and thyroid hormones (DJ. Mangelsdorf, et al., Cell 83:841-850<br>
(1995)). Northern and in situ analysis show that FXR is most abundantly expressed<br>
in the liver, intestine, kidney, and adrenal (BM. Forman, et al., Cell 81:687-693<br>
(1995) and W. Seol, et al., Mol. Endocrinnol. 9:72-85 (1995)). FXR binds to DNA<br>
as a heterodimer widi the 9-cis retinoic acid receptor (RXR). The FXR/RXR<br>
heterodimer preferentially binds to response elements composed of two nuclear<br>
receptor half sites of the consensus AG(G/T)TCA organized as an inverted repeat<br>
and separated by a single nucleotide (IR-1 motif) (BM. Forman, et al., Cell 81:687-<br>
693 (1995)). An early report showed that rat FXR is activated by micromolar<br>
concentrations of farnesoids such as famesol and juvenile hormone (BM. Forman, et<br>
al., Cell 81:687-693 (1995)). However, these compounds failed to activate the<br>
mouse and human FXR, leaving the nature of the endogenous FXR ligand in doubt.<br>
Several naturally-occurring bile acids bind to and activate FXR at physiological<br><br>
concentrations (PCT WO 00/37077, published 29 June 2000)). As discussed therein,<br>
the bile acids that serve as FXR ligands include chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA),<br>
deoxycholic acid (DCA), lithocholic acid (LCA), and the taurine and glycine<br>
conjugates of these bile acids.<br>
Bile acids are cholesterol metabolites that are formed in the liver and secreted<br>
into the duodenum of the intestine, where they have important roles in the<br>
solubilization and absorption of dietary lipids and vitamins. Most bile acids (~95%)<br>
are subsequently reabsorbed in the ileum and returned to the liver via the<br>
enterohepatic circulatory system. The conversion of cholesterol to bile acids in the<br>
liver is under feedback regulation: bile acids down-regulate the transcription of<br>
cytochrome P450 7a (CYP7a), which encodes the enzyme that catalyzes the rate<br>
limiting step in bile acid biosynthesis. There is data to suggest that FXR is involved<br>
in the repression of CYP7a expression by bile acids, although the precise mechanism<br>
remains unclear (DW. Russell, Cell 97:539-542 (1999)). In the ileum, bile acids<br>
induce the expression of the intestinal bile acid binding protein (IBABP), a<br>
cytoplasmic protein which binds bile acids with high affinity and may be involved in<br>
their cellular uptake and trafficking. Two groups have now demonstrated that bile<br>
acids mediate their effects on IBABP expression through activation of FXR, which<br>
binds to an IR-1 type response element that is conserved in the human, rat, and<br>
mouse IBABP gene promoters. Thus FXR is involved in both the stimulation<br>
(IBABP) and the repression (CYP7a) of target genes involved in bile acid and<br>
cholesterol homeostasis.<br>

Detailed description of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to compounds of general formula (I):<br><br>
wherein R is hydrogen or alpha-hydroxy,<br>
the hydroxyl group in position 7 is in the alpha or beta position;<br>
and pharmaceutically acceptable salts, solvates or amino acid conjugates<br>
thereof.<br>
Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable salts according to the present invention<br>
will be readily determined by one skilled in the art and will include, for example,<br>
basic salts such as alkali or alkaline-earth metallic salts made from aluminium,<br><br>
calcium, lithium, magnesium, potassium, sodium, and zinc or organic salts made<br>
from N,N'-dibenzylethyIenediamine, chlorprocaine, choline, diethanolamine,<br>
ethylendiamine, meglumine (N-methylglucamine), and procaine. Salts with<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable amines such as lysine, arginine, tromethamine,<br>
triethylamine and the like can also be used. Such salts of the compounds of formula<br>
(I) may be prepared using conventional techniques, from the compound of Formula<br>
(I) by reacting, for example, the appropriate base wim the compound of Formula (I).<br>
When used in medicine, the salts of a compound of formula (I) should be<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable, but pharmaceutically unacceptable salts may<br>
conveniently be used to prepare the corresponding free base or pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable salts thereof.<br>
As used herein, the term "solvate" is a crystal form containing the compound<br>
of formula (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof and either a<br>
stoichiometric or a non-stoichiometric amount of a solvent. Solvents, by way of<br>
example, include water, methanol, ethanol, or acetic acid. Hereinafter, reference to a<br>
compound of formula (I) is to any physical form of that compound, unless a<br>
particular form, salt or solvate thereof is specified.<br>
As used herein, the term "amino acid conjugates" refers to conjugates of the<br>
compounds of formula (I) with any suitable amino acid. Preferably, such suitable<br>
amino acid conjugates of the compounds of formula (I) will have the added<br>
advantage of enhanced integrity in bile or intestinal fluids. Suitable amino acids<br>
include but are not limited to glycine and taurine. Thus, the present invention<br>
encompasses the glycine and taurine conjugates of any of die compounds of formula<br>
(I)-<br>
In one embodiment, the compound of formula I is a chenodeoxycholic acid<br>
derivative, wherein the hydroxyl group in 7 is in the alpha position and R is<br>
hydrogen.<br><br>
In another embodiment, the compound of formula I is a ursodeoxycholic acid<br>
derivative, wherein the hydroxyl group in 7 is in the beta position and R is<br>
hydrogen.<br>
In another embodiment, the compound of formula I is a cholic acid<br>
derivative, wherein the hydroxyl group in 7 is in the alpha position and R is alpha-<br>
hydroxy.<br>
Hereinafter all references to "compounds of formula (I)" refer to compounds<br>
of formula (I) as described above together with their and pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable salts, solvates or amino acid conjugates thereof.<br>
The compounds of formula I may be prepared starting from the 6-ethyl-7-<br>
keto-cholic acids, prepared as disclosed in EP 1392714 and EP 1568796, suitably<br>
protected at the 3-hydroxy moiety, by a reaction sequence comprising the<br>
transformation of the C24 carboxy group into a iodine atom, the conversion of the<br>
latter into an hydroxyl group, reduction of the 7-keto group to give the<br>
corresponding 3-alpha or 3-beta hydroxyl group, the selective sulfonylation of the<br>
C24 hydroxy group and the deprotection of the 3-hydroxy group.<br>
The reaction scheme and the reagents used in each step are reported in the<br>
following scheme showing the preparation of 3α,7α,23-trihydroxy-6α-ethyl-24-nor-<br>
5β-cholan-23 -sulphate in the form of triethylammonium salt (UPF-987 or compound<br>
(9) below). The same scheme may be adapted, by suitably substituting the reagents<br>
and/or starting materials and optionally by also changing reaction sequences and<br>
protective groups, for the preparation of other compounds of formula I.<br><br><br>
The reaction scheme and the reagents used in each step are reported in the<br>
following scheme below showing the preparation of 3α,7α,23-trihydroxy-6α-ethyl-<br>
24-nor-5β-cholan-23-sulphate in the form of sodium salt (INT-1103 or compound<br>
(10) below). The same scheme may be adapted, by suitably substituting the reagents<br>
and/or starting materials and optionally by also changing reaction sequences and<br>
protective groups, for the preparation of other pharmaceutically acceptable salt<br>
forms of formula I.<br><br><br>
As explained in greater detail in the experimental section, compound 9 was<br>
tested in a cell-free assay and transactivation assay in a human hepatocyte cell line<br>
and in vivo in intact mice and rats rendered cholestatic by administration of alfa-<br>
nafthylsiotiocyanate (ANIT). In the FRET assay, the compound was found to be<br>
approximately 1000 fold more potent than chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) in<br>
activating FXR. In the tranactivation assay Compound 9 caused 2 fold induction of<br>
bile acid transporter, BSEP (bile salt export pump) and the small heterodimeric<br>
partner (SHP, an atypical nuclear receptor that lacks a ONA-binding domain).<br><br>
Further it potently suppressed Cyp7Al, SREPB-lc and the fatty acid synthase<br>
(FAS), thus indicating that FXR activation by the compound of the invention allows<br>
selective modulation of genes involved in bile acid synthesis as well as in lipid,<br>
cholesterol and glucose metabolism. Therefore, compounds of formula (I) act as<br>
selective modulators of the bile acid transporters and increase the flux of biliary<br>
acids in the liver; furthermore, they potently regulate genes involved in lipid and<br>
cholesterol metabolism and for this reason they can be used for the prevention or<br>
treatment of FXR-mediated diseases or conditions, which include chronic liver<br>
disease (involving one or more of cholestasis, steatosis, inflammation, fibrosis, and<br>
cirrhosis), gastrointestinal disease, renal disease, cardiovascular disease, and<br>
metabolic disease. Chronic liver diseases which may be prevented or treated using<br>
compounds of formula (I) include but are not limited to primary biliary cirrhosis<br>
(PBC), primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis<br>
(CTX), drug induced cholestasis, intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy, parenteral<br>
nutrition associated cholestasis (PNAC), bacterial overgrowth or sepsis associated<br>
cholestasis, autoimmune hepatitis, chronic viral hepatitis, alcoholic liver disease,<br>
nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH),<br>
liver transplant associated graft versus host disease, living donor transplant liver<br>
regeneration, congenital hepatic fibrosis, choledocholithiasis, granulomatous liver<br>
disease, intra- or extrahepatic malignancy, Sjogren's syndrome, Sarcoidosis,<br>
Wilson's disease, Gaucher's disease, hemochromatosis, and alpha 1-antitrypsin<br>
deficiency. Gastrointestinal diseases which may be prevented or treated using<br>
compounds of formula (I) include but are not limited to inflammatory bowel disease<br>
(IBD) (including Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis), irritable bowel syndrome<br>
(IBS), bacterial overgrowth , malabsorption, post-radiation colitis, and microscopic<br>
colitis. Renal diseases which may be prevented or treated using compounds of<br>
formula (I) include but are not limited to diabetic nephropathy, focal segmental<br><br>
glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), hypertensive nephrosclerosis, chronic<br>
glomerulonephritis, chronic transplant glomerulopathy, chronic interstitial nephritis,<br>
and polycystic kidney disease. Cardiovascular diseases which may be prevented or<br>
treated using compounds of formula (I) include but are not limited to<br>
atherosclerosis, arteriosclerosis, dyslipidemia, hypercholesterolemia, and<br>
hypertriglyceridemia. Metabolic diseases which may be prevented or treated using<br>
compounds of formula (I) include but are not limited to insulin resistance, Type I<br>
and Type II diabetes, and obesity.<br>
The methods of the present invention comprise the step of administering a<br>
therapeutically effective amount of a compound of formula (I). As used herein, the<br>
term "therapeutically effective amount" refers to an amount of a compound of<br>
formula (I) which is sufficient to achieve the stated effect. Accordingly, a<br>
therapeutically effective amount of a compound of formula (I) used in a method for<br>
the prevention or treatment of FXR mediated diseases or conditions will be an<br>
amount sufficient to prevent or treat the FXR mediated disease or condition.<br>
Similarly, a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of formula (I) for use in<br>
a method for the prophylaxis or treatment of cholestatic liver diseases or increasing<br>
bile flow will be an amount sufficient to increase bile flow to the intestine.<br>
The amount of the compound of formula (I) which is required to achieve the<br>
desired biological effect will depend on a number of factors such as the use for<br>
which it is intended, the means of administration, and the recipient, and will be<br>
ultimately at the discretion of the attendant physician or veterinarian. In general, a<br>
typical daily dose for the treatment of FXR mediated diseases and conditions, for<br>
instance, may be expected to lie in the range of from about 0.01 mg/kg to about 100<br>
mg/kg. This dose may be administered as a single unit dose or as several separate<br>
unit doses or as a continuous infusion. Similar dosages would be applicable for the<br>
treatment of other diseases, conditions and therapies including the prophylaxis and<br><br>
treatment of cholestatic liver diseases.<br>
Thus, in a further aspect, the present invention provides pharmaceutical<br>
compositions comprising, as active ingredient, a compound of formula (I) together,<br>
and/or in admixture, with at least one pharmaceutical carrier or diluent. These<br>
pharmaceutical compositions may be used in the prophylaxis and treatment of the<br>
foregoing diseases or conditions.<br>
The carrier must be pharmaceutically acceptable and must be compatible<br>
with, i.e. not have a deleterious effect upon, the other ingredients in the composition.<br>
The carrier may be a solid or liquid and is preferably formulated as a unit dose<br>
formulation, for example, a tablet which may contain from 0.05 to 95% by weight of<br>
the active ingredient. If desired, other physiologically active ingredients may also be<br>
incorporated in the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention.<br>
Possible formulations include those suitable for oral, sublingual, buccal,<br>
parenteral (for example subcutaneous, intramuscular, or intravenous), rectal, topical<br>
including transdermal, intranasal and inhalation administration. Most suitable means<br>
of administration for a particular patient will depend on the nature and severity of<br>
the disease or condition being treated or the nature of the therapy being used and on<br>
the nature of the active compound, but where possible, oral administration is<br>
preferred for the prevention and treatment of FXR mediated diseases and conditions.<br>
Formulations suitable for oral administration may be provided as discrete<br>
units, such as tablets, capsules, cachets, lozenges, each containing a predetermined<br>
amount of the active compound; as powders or granules; as solutions or suspensions<br>
in aqueous or non-aqueous liquids; or as oil-in-water or water-in-oil emulsions.<br>
Formulations suitable for sublingual or buccal administration include<br>
lozenges comprising the active compound and, typically a flavoured base, such as<br>
sugar and acacia or tragacanth and pastilles comprising the active compound in an<br>
inert base, such as gelatine and glycerine or sucrose acacia.<br><br>
Formulations suitable for parenteral administration typically comprise sterile<br>
aqueous solutions containing a predetermined concentration of the active compound;<br>
the solution is preferably isotonic with the blood of the intended recipient.<br>
Additional formulations suitable for parenteral administration include formulations<br>
containing physiologically suitable co-solvents and/or complexing agents such as<br>
surfactants and cyclodextrins. Oil-in-water emulsions are also suitable formulations<br>
for parenteral formulations. Although such solutions are preferably administered<br>
intravenously, they may also be administered by subcutaneous or intramuscular<br>
injection.<br>
Formulations suitable for rectal administration are preferably provided as<br>
unit-dose suppositories comprising the active ingredient in one or more solid carriers<br>
forming the suppository base, for example, cocoa butter.<br>
Formulations suitable for topical or intranasal application include ointments,<br>
creams, lotions, pastes, gels, sprays, aerosols and oils. Suitable carriers for such<br>
formulations include petroleum jelly, lanolin, polyethyleneglycols, alcohols, and<br>
combinations thereof.<br>
Formulations of the invention may be prepared by any suitable method,<br>
typically by uniformly and intimately admixing the active compound with liquids or<br>
finely divided solid carriers or both, in the required proportions and then, if<br>
necessary, shaping the resulting mixture into the desired shape.<br>
For example a tablet may be prepared by compressing an intimate mixture<br>
comprising a powder or granules of the active ingredient and one or more optional<br>
ingredients, such as a binder, lubricant, inert diluent, or surface active dispersing<br>
agent, or by moulding an intimate mixture of powdered active ingredient and inert<br>
liquid diluent.<br>
Suitable formulations for administration by inhalation include fine particle<br>
dusts or mists which may be generated by means of various types of metered dose<br><br>
pressurised aerosols, nebulisers, or insufflators.<br>
For pulmonary administration via the mouth, the particle size of the powder<br>
or droplets is typically in the range 0.5-10 μm, preferably 1-5 μm, to ensure delivery<br>
into the bronchial tree. For nasal administration, a particle size in the range 10-500<br>
μm is preferred to ensure retention in the nasal cavity.<br>
Metered dose inhalers are pressurised aerosol dispensers, typically containing<br>
a suspension or solution formulation of the active ingredient in a liquefied<br>
propellant. During use, these devices discharge the formulation through a valve<br>
adapted to deliver a metered volume, typically from 10 to 150 μl, to produce a fine<br>
particle spray containing the active ingredient. Suitable propellants include certain<br>
chlorofluorocarbon compounds, for example, dichlorodifluoromethane,<br>
trichlorofluoromethane, dichlorotetrafluoroethane and mixtures thereof. The<br>
formulation may additionally contain one or more co-solvents, for example, ethanol<br>
surfactants, such as oleic acid or sorbitan trioleate, anti-oxidants and suitable<br>
flavouring agents.<br>
Nebulisers are commercially available devices that transform solutions or<br>
suspensions of the active ingredient into a therapeutic aerosol mist either by means<br>
of acceleration of a compressed gas typically air or oxygen, through a narrow<br>
venturi orifice, or by means of ultrasonic agitation. Suitable formulations for use in<br>
nebulisers consist of the active ingredient in a liquid carrier and comprise up to 40%<br>
w/w of the formulation, preferably less than 20% w/w. The carrier is typically water<br>
or a dilute aqueous alcoholic solution, preferably made isotonic with body fluids by<br>
the addition of, for example, sodium chloride. Optional additives include<br>
preservatives if the formulation is not prepared sterile, for example, methyl hydroxy-<br>
benzoate, anti-oxidants, flavouring agents, volatile oils, buffering agents and<br>
surfactants.<br>
Suitable formulations for administration by insufflation include finely<br><br>
comminuted powders which may be delivered by means of an insufflator or taken<br>
into the nasal cavity in the manner of a snuff. In the insufflator, the powder is<br>
contained in capsules or cartridges, typically made of gelatin or plastic, which are<br>
either pierced or opened in situ and the powder delivered by air drawn through the<br>
device upon inhalation or by means of a manually-operated pump. The powder<br>
employed in the insufflator consists either solely of the active ingredient or of a<br>
powder blend comprising the active ingredient, a suitable powder diluent, such as<br>
lactose, and an optional surfactant. The active ingredient typically comprises from<br>
0.1 to 100 w/w of the formulation.<br>
In addition to the ingredients specifically mentioned above, the formulations<br>
of the present invention may include other agents known to those skilled in the art of<br>
pharmacy, having regard for the type of formulation in issue. For example,<br>
formulations suitable for oral administration may include flavouring agents and<br>
formulations suitable for intranasal administration may include perfumes.<br>
Therefore, according to a further aspect of the present invention, there is<br>
provided the use of the compounds of formula (I) in the preparation of medicaments<br>
for the prevention or treatment of FXR mediated diseases or conditions.<br>
The invention will be hereinafter illustrated in more detail in the following<br>

EXAMPLE 2<br>
Biological activities<br>
Tests were first carried out in order to verify whether UPF-987 modulates<br>
FXR-regulated genes, in comparison with chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA). CDCA is<br>
a primary bile acid that functions as an endogenous ligand of the farnesoid-x-<br>
receptor (FXR; NR1H4). The biological activity of UPF-987 on FXR activity was<br>
first tested in an in vitro assay using the fluorescence resonance energy transfer<br>
(FRET) cell free assay, described in Pellicciari R., et al. J Med Chem. 2002<br>
15;45.3569-72.<br>
Briefly, reactions contained europium-labeled anti-GST antibody and<br>
streptavidin-conjugated allophycocyanin, FXR GST-LBD fusion proteins and<br>
biotinylated SRC1 sensor peptide. Reactions were incubated at room temperature for<br>
1 h in FRET buffer (10 mM Hepes, pH 7.9, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM MgC12, 1 mM<br>
EDTA, 0.1 mg/ml BSA). FRET was measured on a Victor 1420 multilabel counter.<br><br>
In the FRET cell-free assay, the recruitment of Scr-1, a co-activating factor<br>
for FXR, occurs at a concentration of compound that is almost 300-fold lower than<br>
that required for the natural FXR-ligand CDCA (Table 1).<br><br>
1 Relative recruitment of the SRC1 peptide to FXR where CDCA = 100%.<br>
All data are mean ± SE, n = 4.<br>
It was also evaluated if UPF-987 modulated FXR-regulated genes in a<br>
cellular assay using a human hepatocyte cell line (HepG2). In a cell transfection<br>
assay using the HepG2 cell line, UPF-987 proved a potent FXR ligand. Exposure of<br>
HepG2 cells to UPF-987 transactivates FXR. In other experiments using liver cells<br>
transfected with viral constructs carrying the FXR gene or other nuclear receptors<br>
cloned upstream to the luciferase gene, it was found that UPF-987 functions as a<br>
selective FXR ligand in mouse, rat, and human hepatocytes. A detailed description<br>
of these methods can be found in the following reference: Fiorucci S., et al.<br>
Gastroenterology 2004.<br>
Briefly, for luciferase assay, HepG2 cells were cultured in E-MEM<br>
supplemented with 1 % penicillin/streptomycin, 1% L-glutamine and 10% fetal<br>
bovine serum (high glucose) (CELBIO). Cells were grown at 37°C in 5% CO2. All<br>
the transfections were making using a calcium phosphate coprecipitation method in<br>
the presence of 25 uM chloroquine as inhibitor for DNA degradation. Transient<br>
transfections were performed using 500 ng of reporter vector phsp27-TKLUC, 200<br>
ng pCMV-Pgal, as internal control for transfection efficiency, and SO ng of each<br>
receptor expression plasmid pSG5-FXR, pSG5-RXR. The pGEM vector was added<br><br>
to normalize the amounts of DNA transfected in each assay (2.5 μg). The<br>
transfection efficiency was evaluated by p-gal expression, obtained by co-<br>
transfecting the cells with pCMV-pgal plasmid. Forty-Eight hours post-transfection,<br>
HepG2 cells were stimulated with 1 μM UPF-987 for 18 h. Control cultures received<br>
vehicle (0.1% DMSO) alone. Cells were lysed in 100 ul diluted reporter lysis buffer<br>
(Promega), and 0.2 ul cellular lisate was assayed for luciferase activity using<br>
Luciferase Assay System (Promega). Luminescence was measured using an<br>
automated luminometer. Luciferase activities were normalized for transfection<br>
efficiencies by dividing the relative light units by p-galactosidase activity.<br>
Regulation of FXR Target Gene Expression by UPF-987 in HepG2 Cells<br>
To establish if UPF-987 is a FXR modulator and exerts differential activities,<br>
human HepG2 cells were exposed to UPF-987, CDCA (natural FXR ligand) and to<br>
its 6-ethyl-derivative, 6-ECDCA, which is a potent FXR ligand. The effects of these<br>
ligands on FXR responsive genes was then investigated by quantitative reverse<br>
transcription PCR (qRT-PCR).<br>
Briefly, all PCR primers were designed using PRIMER3-OUTPUT software<br>
using published sequence data from the NCBI database. Total RNA was isolated<br>
(TRIzol reagen, Invitrogen srl, Milan, Italy) from specimens taken from livers. One<br>
microgram of purified RNA was treated with DNAse I for 10 minutes at room<br>
temperature, followed by incubation at 95°C for 3 minutes in the presence of 2.5<br>
mmol/L EDTA. The RNA was reverse transcribed with Superscript III (Invitrogen,<br>
Carsbad, CA) in 20uL reaction volume using reandom primers. For quantitative RT-<br>
PCR, 100 ng template was dissolved in a 25 μL containing 0.3 umol/L of each<br>
primer and 12.5 μL of 2X SYBR Green PCR Master mix (Fynnzimes-DyNAmo<br>
SYBRR Green qPCR mix). All reactions were performed in triplicate, and the<br>
thermal cycling conditions were as follows: 2 minutes at 95°C, followed by 50<br>
cycles of 95°C for 20 seconds, 55°C for 20 seconds and 72°C for 30 seconds on<br><br>
iCycler iQ instrument (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). The mean value of the replicates for<br>
each sample was calculated and expressed as the cycle threshold (CT; cycle number<br>
at which each PCR reaction reaches a predetermined fluorescent threshold, set<br>
within the linear range of all reactions). The amount of gene expression was then<br>
calculated as the difference (ACT) between the CT value of the sample for the target<br>
gene and the mean CT value of that sample for the endogenous control (GAPDH).<br>
Relative expression was calculated as the difference (AACT) between ACT values of<br>
the test control sample for each target gene. The relative mRNA expression was<br>
shown as 2-AACT (Figure 3). The Primers used in Real-Time PCR were:<br>
hGAPDH: gaaggtgaaggtcggagt and catgggtggaatcatattggaa;<br>
hCYP7Al: caccttgaggacggttccta and cgatccaaagggcatgtagt;<br>
hSHP: gctgtctggagtccttctgg and ccaatgatagggcgaaagaagag;<br>
hBSEP: gggccattgtacgagatcctaa and tgcaccgtcttttcactttctg;<br>
hSREBPlc: gcaaggccatcgactacatt and ggtcagtgtgtcctccacct.<br>
In contrast to Figure 3, a different in vitro experiment using quantitative<br>
reverse transcription PCR, demonstrated that while no direct cell toxicity was<br>
observed upon exposure to any of these ligands, exposure of HepG2 cells to CDCA<br>
and its 6-ECDCA derivative, resulted in a 2-3 fold induction of SHP, an FXR<br>
regulated gene. By contrast, despite the fact that UPF-987 is a FXR ligand (see<br>
above), it stimulates SHP expression. All the FXR ligands tested, namely CDCA, 6-<br>
ECDCA and UPF-987 exerted the same effect on CYP7al (all agents caused a 60-<br>
70% reduction of the expression of CYP7α1 mRNA). In addition, exposure to UPF-<br>
987 induced BSEP and SHP mRNA expression (approximately 2-3 fold induction).<br>
This effect was significantly more pronounced with UPF-987 than with the other<br>
FXR ligands. Furthermore, similarly to the other ligands, exposure to UPF-987<br>
resulted in a potent inhibition of SREPB-1c and FAS mRNA expression. Taken<br>
together, these data suggest that UPF-987 is an FXR modulator that functions as a<br><br>
potent FXR ligand, and unexpectedly alters FXR regulated genes, causing<br>
significant induction of bile acid transporters (for example BSEP) and potent<br>
suppression of lipid-related genes. In addition, UPF-987 represses the expression of<br>
Cyp7al, a gene that is critically involved in bile acid synthesis from cholesterol.<br>
The regulation of these FXR target genes suggests that UPF-987 is a gene-selective<br>
FXR ligand that may inhibit bile acid biosynthesis through the classical pathway<br>
while increasing bile acid secretion from hepatocytes, without interfering with SHP<br>
expression. This effect is desirable, since it narrows the pharmacological activities<br>
of these FXR ligands, and might prevent metabolic activation typically associated<br>
with SHP induction.<br>
Results of In vitro pharmacology studies on UPF-987 are shown in Table 2<br>
below.<br><br><br><br>
Example 3<br>
Regulation of FXR target genes by UPF-987 in vivo<br>
Background<br>
Compound 9 is also referred to as UPF-987. FXR plays a key role in the<br>
transcriptional regulation of genes involved in bile acid metabolism and<br>
lipid/cholesterol and glucose homeostasis. The regulation of these interactions is<br>
highly complex and contains multiple feedback loops to self-regulate the<br>
transcriptional circuits. The overlapping range of agonistic and antagonistic ligands,<br>
as well as of target genes shared by FXR with other metabolic nuclear receptors<br>
including PPARs and LXR, may serve as a redundant safety mechanism to elicit a<br>
protective response so that even when one pathway is compromised, a salvage<br>
pathway takes over. Crucial to the complexity of putative convergent and divergent<br><br>
functions of the metabolic nuclear receptors are their transcriptional coactivators and<br>
corepressors, that will be recruited in various manner from FXR modulators.<br>
FXR modulators will be used for the treatment of the inflammatory,<br>
cholestatic, fibrotic liver disorders, and metabolic disorders including<br>
hypertriglyceridemic and hypercholesterolemia states and, by extension,<br>
atherosclerosis and its complications.<br>
In conclusion, FXR is emerging as a particularly intriguing therapeutic target,<br>
not only for the promising application associated with its modulation but also for its<br>
peculiar mechanism of ligand recognition and gene activation.<br>
Materials and Methods<br>
Animals<br>
Six- to eight-week old female Balb/c mice were obtained from Charles River<br>
(Charles River Laboratories, Inc., Wilmington, MA). Animals were fed a standard<br>
chow pellet diet, had free access to water, and were maintained on a 12-h light/dark<br>
cycle. All procedures in this study were approved by the Animal Study Committees<br>
of the University of Perugia (Italy) according to governmental guidelines for animal<br>
care. Animals were treated for 5 days by intraperitoneal injection of 6-ECDCA<br>
Smg/Kg/day, while control animals were treated with vehicle alone (methyl-<br>
cellulose). At the end of the experiment mice were sacrificed and liver was removed<br>
to perform Real Time PCR analysis of FXR target genes.<br>
Quantitative Real-Time PCR<br>
Quantitative Real-Time PCR was performed as above (see 1.1 Materials and<br>
Methods). The primers used were:<br>
mGAPDH: ctgagtatgtcgtggagtctac and gttggtggtgcaggatgcattg<br>
mBSEP: aaatcggatggtttgactgc and tgacagcgagaatcaccaag<br>
mSHP: tctcttcttccgccctatca and aagggcttgctggacagtta<br>
mCYP7Al: aagccatgatgcaaaacctc and gccggaaatacttggtcaaa<br><br>
mSREBPlc: gatcaaagaggagccagtgc and tagatggtggctgctgagtg<br>
Results<br>
In vivo administration of the UPF-987 to intact mice for 4 days at the dose of<br>
S mg/kg resulted in a potent induction of BSEP and SHP in the liver. Despite<br>
encouraging yet inconsistent target gene expression data with preliminary in vitro<br>
assays discussed above, the observed in vivo data suggest potent downregulation<br>
(60-70% reduction) of Cyp7al. UPF-987 which also caused 90% inhibition of<br>
SREBP-lc and reduced FAS mRNA expression in the liver (Fig. 5).<br>

Evaluation of UPF-987 anti-inflammatory activity in TNBS mouse model of<br>
colitis<br>
Materials and Methods<br>
Colitis models<br>
The intracolonic application of the hapten TNBS causes acute and chronic colitis in<br>
rodents. Mucosal inflammation in TNBS-colitis has a prominent neutrophilic<br>
infiltrate, but also comprises influx of CCR1+ and CCR5+ macrophages and<br>
monocytes as well as a prominent IL-12 and IFN-dependent T lymphocyte (Thl)<br>
activation. Histopathological features resemble human Crohn's disease, transmural<br>
inflammation, granulomas, Assuring ulcers and "skip lesions" (regions of ulceration<br>
separated by regions of normal mucosa". TNBS-colitis serves as a useful pre-<br>
clinical model for testing established and innovative treatments for Crohn's disease.<br>
Animals<br>
Animals were monitored daily for appearance of diarrhea, loss of body weight, and<br>
survival. At the end of the experiment, surviving mice were sacrificed, blood<br>
samples collected by cardiac puncture, and a 7 cm segment of colon was excised,<br>
weighed, and macroscopic damage was evaluated.<br>
Induction of Colitis and Study Design<br><br>
Colitis was induced in BALB/c mice (8 weeks old) by intra-rectal administration of<br>
TNBS (0.5 mg/mouse) Beginning three hours later and continuing at 24-h intervals<br>
for five days, the mice were administered intra- peritoneally, UPF-987 (0.3-1-<br>
3mg/kg) or vehicle (methyl cellulose 1 %). Each group consisted of 5 or 7 mice.<br>
The mice were sacrificed 18h after the final administration of the test drug or<br>
vehicle. The severity of colitis was scored by assessing the macroscopic<br>
appearance. The latter is an index of granulocyte infiltration in the tissue. The<br>
macroscopic scoring of colitis has been described in detail by Fiorucci et al, and<br>
involved blind scoring on a 0 (normal) to 4 (severe damage) scale. Body weight and<br>
stool consistency was recorded at the start and end of the study. Tissue samples<br>
were collected from the distal colon of each mouse and processed, as described<br>
previously.<br>
Macroscopic Grading of Colitis<br>
Colons were examined under a dissecting microscope (x 5) and graded for<br>
macroscopic lesions on a scale from 0 to 10 based on criteria reflecting<br>
inflammation, such as hyperemia, thickening of the bowel, and the extent of<br>
ulceration.<br>
Quantitative Real-Time PCR<br>
Mouse colon genes expression was evaluated by quantitative real-time polymerase<br>
chain reaction (RT-PCR) like previously described. Total RNA was isolated from<br>
speciments taken from distal colon. Followed primers were designed using<br>
PRIMER3-OUTPUT software, using published sequence data from the NCBI<br>
database:<br>

Evaluation of efficacy of UPF-987 in rat cholestatic model (ANIT)<br>
Background<br>
Cholestasis results in intrahepatic accumulation of cytotoxic bile acids which<br>
cause liver injury ultimately leading to biliary fibrosis and cirrhosis. Cholestatic<br>
liver damage is counteracted by a variety of intrinsic hepatoprotective mechanisms.<br>
Such defense mechanisms include repression of hepatic bile acid uptake and de novo<br>
bile acid synthesis. Furthermore, phase I and II bile acid detoxification is induced<br>
rendering bile acids more hydrophilic. In addition to "orthograde" export via<br>
canalicular export systems, these compounds are also excreted via basolateral<br>
"alternative" export systems into the systemic circulation followed by renal<br>
elimination. Passive glomerular filtration of hydrophilic bile acids, active renal<br>
tubular secretion, and repression of tubular bile acid reabsorption facilitate renal bile<br>
acid elimination during cholestasis. The underlying molecular mechanisms are<br>
mediated mainly at a transcriptional level via a complex network involving nuclear<br>
receptors and other transcription factors. So far, the farnesoid X receptor FXR,<br>
pregnane X receptor PXR, and vitamin D receptor VDR. have been identified as<br>
nuclear receptors for bile acids. However, the intrinsic adaptive response to bile<br>
acids cannot fully prevent liver injury in cholestasis. Therefore, additional<br>
therapeutic strategies such as targeted activation of nuclear receptors are needed to<br>
enhance the hepatic defense against toxic bile acids.<br>

Animals<br><br>
Wistar Rats studies were approved by the Animal Study Committee of the<br>
University of Perugia. Male Wistar rats (200-250 g) were obtained from Charles<br>
River Breeding Laboratories (Portage, MI) and maintained on standard laboratory<br>
rat chow on a 12-h light/dark cycle.<br>
Colestatic models: Method:alpha-naphtbyl-isothiocyanate (ANIT)<br>
The first rats group (N=6) was treated, daily, by ANIT 100mg/kg via gavage<br>
(colestatic inducer), the second and third groups (N=6) were treated by ANIT<br>
100mg/kg via gavage plus UPF-987 5 and 3 mg/kg intrapcritoncally daily. Control<br>
rats (N=4) were administered vehicle (physiologic solution LP.). At the end of the<br>
study, rats were sacrificed under anaesthesia with sodium pentobarbital (50 mg/kg<br>
t.p.) and terminally bled via cardiac puncture; the liver was removed and weighted<br>
for examination and blood samples were taken.<br>

Results<br><br>
UPF-987 was tested in vivo for its ability to protect against cholestasis<br>
induced in rat by α-naphthylisothiocyanate (ANIT). ANIT administration leads to a<br>
severe cholestasis, previous studies by Fionicci et al. (unpublished) have shown that<br>
6-ECDCA is not effective in reducing liver injury in this model. Administration of<br>
UPF-987 attenuates liver injury in ANIT treated rats, as measured by assessing<br>
plasma levels of AST, γGT and alkaline phosphatase, three markers of cholestasis<br>
and plasma cholesterol. In addition UPF-987, modulates NTCP, CYP7A1 and BSEP<br>
expression.<br>

Evalutation of efficacy of INT-1103 in rat cholestatic model (BTL)<br>
Material and Methods<br>
The (BTL) hepatic cholestatic model was induced by bile duct ligation (BDL) of<br>
225-250g old male Wistar rats. Sham-operated rats (N = 8) received the same<br>
laparoscopic procedure, except that the bile duct was manipulated, but not ligated<br>
and sectioned. In total, 24 animals were operated. Three days after surgery,<br>
surviving rats were randomized to receive placebo, intraperitoneally, (fisiologic<br>
solution) (N=6) or INT-1103 5 mg/kg (N=*8). Animals were then treated for 7 days.<br>
At the end of the study, rats were sacrificed under anaesthesia with sodium<br>
pentobarbital (SO mg/kg i.p.) and terminally bled via cardiac puncture; the liver was<br>
weighted and removed for examination and blood samples were taken.<br><br>
Example 8<br>
Evaluation of efficacy of INT-1103 and INT-747 in bile flow on naive rat<br>
Material and Methods<br>
Adult male Wistar rats weighing 200 to 250 g were used throughout the study.<br>
Before the experiments, the animals were maintained on standard chow and water ad<br>
libitum and housed in a temperature (21-23°C)- and humidity (45-50%)-controlled<br>
room under a 12-h light/dark cycle. All studies were approved by the Animal Study<br>
Committee of the University of Perugia. For bile flow measurement, animals were<br>
anesthetized with a single dose of sodium pentobarbital (50 mg/kg body wt<br>
intraperitoneally) and maintained under this condition throughout the experiment.<br>
After catheterization of the jugular vein using a PE-50 polyethylene tubing<br>
(Intramedic; Clay Adams, Parsippany, NJ), a middle abdominal incision was made,<br>
and the common bile duct was also cannulated (PE-10, Intramedic; Clay Adams)..<br>
Body temperature was maintained at 37.0 to 38.5°C with a warming lamp to prevent<br>
hypothermic alterations of bile flow.. The bile samples were collected by the<br>
external biliary fistula every IS min for 195 min and then weighed in order to<br>
determine the bile flow. Bile flow was determined by gravimetry, assuming a<br>
density of the bile of 1.0 g/ml. Bile collection started between 9:00 and 11:00 AM to<br>
minimize influence of circadian variations. Drugs admininistration was done by<br>
jugular cannula at the doses of 3μmoli/kg/min, control group received vehicle alone<br>
(BSA 2% on fisilogic solution).<br>

(N=7);<br>
4.	17 -ethynylestradiol Smg/kg + INT-1103 Smg/kg intra-peritoneal, for 5 days<br>
(N=7).<br>
For bile collection, surgical procedures were made on the sixth day ( 1 day after the<br>
administration of the last dose of E217 ). For bile flow measurement, animals were<br>
anesthetized with a single dose of sodium pentobarbital (50 mg/kg body wt<br>
intraperitoneally) and maintained under this condition throughout the experiment. A<br>
middle abdominal incision was made, and the common bile duct was also cannulated<br>
(PE-10, Intramedic; Clay Adams).. Body temperature was maintained at 37.0 to<br>

collection started between 9:00 and 11:00 AM to minimize influence of circadian<br>
variations. Bile was collected at 15-min intervals for 120 min, and bile flow was<br>
determined gravimetrically. At the end of the experiments the body and liver rats<br>
was weighted.<br>

For RT-PCR assay, pancreatic Beta-TC6 cells were cultured in D-MEM<br><br>
supplemented with 1% penicillin/streptomycin, 1% L-glutamine and 10% fetal<br>
bovine serum (high glucose) (CELBIO). Cells were grown at 37°C in 5% C02 and<br>
treated with INT-1103 and INT-747, at the final concentration 1μM, for 18 hours. At<br>
the and of the experiments the cells were collected for RNA extraction.<br>
Real Time PCR<br>
Quantification of the expression of mouse genes was performed by<br>
quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). All PCR primers were<br>
designed using PRIMER3-OUTPUT software using published sequence data from<br>
the NCBI database. Total RNA was isolated (TRIzol reagen, Invitrogen srl, Milan,<br>
Italy) from speciments taken from livers. One microgram of purified RNA was<br>
treated with DNAse I for 10 minutes at room temperature, followed by incubation at<br>
95°C for 3 minutes in the presence of 2.5 mmol/L EDTA. The RNA was reverse<br>
transcribed with Superscript III (Invitrogen, Carsbad, CA) in 20uL reaction volume<br>
using reandom primers. For quantitative RT-PCR, 100 ng template was dissolved in<br>
a 25 μL containing 0.3 μmol/L of each primer and 12.5 μL of 2X SYBR Green PCR<br>
Master mix (Fynnzimes*DyNAmo SYBRR Green qPCR mix). All reactions were<br>
performed in triplicate, and the thermal cycling conditions were as follows: 2<br>
minutes at 95°C, followed by 50 cycles of 95ºC for 20 seconds, 55°C for 20 seconds<br>
and 72°C for 30 seconds on iCycler iQ instrument (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). The<br>
mean value of the replicates for each sample was calculated and expressed as the<br>
cycle threshold (CT; cycle number at which each PCR reaction reaches a<br>
predetermined fluorescent threshold, set within the linear range of all reactions). The<br>
amount of gene expression was then calculated as the difference (ACT) between the<br>
CT value of the sample for the target gene and the mean CT value of that sample for<br>
the endogenous control (GAPDH). Relative expression was calculated as the<br>
difference (AACT) between ACT values of the test control sample for each target<br>
gene. The relative mRNA expression was shown as 2-∆∆CT . The Primers used in<br><br>
Real-Time PCR were:<br>

Physico-chemical properties of INT-747 and INT-1103<br>
Background<br>
The two bile acid analogues, INT-747 and INT-1103, were admitted to a complete<br>
physico-chemical properties characterization following protocols previously<br>
developed and optimized in our laboratory and previously applied for a complete<br>
screening of a large series of Bile acid analogues (UDCA analogues) developed in<br>
the R. Pellicciari lab. The physico-chemical properties were selected to accurately<br>
define the behaviour in aqueous solutions and in biological fluids and to establish<br>
their potential toxicity to biological membranes, their pharmacokinetics and<br>
pharmacodynamics and biodistribution in the different biological fluids and organs.<br>
Comparative data with natural analogues will be also performed and discussed.<br>
Water Solubility<br>
Only side chain carboxylated BA INT-747, CDCA and UDCA were studied. Solid<br>
BA were suspended in 5 ml of 0.1 M HC1. The saturated solutions, after incubation<br>
for 1 week, were filtered on a Millipore filter (0.22 urn) and the concentration of BA<br>
was measured by HPLC-ESI-MS/MS using C18 column (150mm x 2mm i.d., 4um)<br>
and mobile phases of water containing 15mM acetic acid pH 5 and acetonitrile. The<br><br>
flow rate was 150 μl/min. The mass spectrometry acquisition was performed in the<br>
multiple reaction monitoring mode using the ESI source in negative ionization.<br>
Water solubility was expressed as μmol/liter<br><br>
The water solubility was measured for the insoluble protonated species of<br>
carboxylated bile acids at a pH 1. The sulphate compound, UPF 1103 is ionized even<br>
at low pH and in physiological conditions is always soluble in all biological fluids.<br>
The water solubility of INT-747 is 9 uM , lower than CDCA, and comparable with<br>
that of UDCA. Since the CMC of INT-747 is relatively low (see next paragraph), the<br>
low water solubility of INT-747 do not compromise the behaviour of the compound<br>
in a micellar phase; in the case of UDCA, the low water solubility associated with an<br>
high CMC compromises the pH at which the protonated acid goes in solution to<br>
form micelles. The CMpH is, in fact, for UDCA 8.4, which is too high if is not<br>
present a postprandial alkalinization in duodenal content.<br>
Critical Micellar Concentration (CMC)<br>
This value was determined by surface tension measurements using a maximum<br>
bubble-pressure method. The tensiometer was a Sensadyne 6000 (Chem-Dyne<br>
Research Corp., Milwaukee, WI) equipped with two glass probes of 0.5 and 4.0 mm<br>
diameters connected to a source of nitrogen. The bubble frequency was 1<br>
bubble/second in distilled water at 26°C (P=2.7 atm) and the calibration was made<br>
with double-distilled water and methanol. The surface tension of BA sodium salts<br><br>
solutions both in water and in NaCl 0.15 M was measured at various concentrations<br>
range, 0.2-75 mM and 0.3-100 mM respectively. The surface tension values were<br>
plotted against the logarithm of the bile salt concentration; the regression lines<br>
corresponding to the two parts of the curve (monomelic and micellar phases) were<br>
calculated using the method of least squares, and the intersection of the lines was<br>
taken as the CMC value.<br><br>
The CMC, as evaluated by surface tension measurements in non equilibrium<br>
conditions i.e. in conditions that impurities do not affect the results, of INT-747 and<br>
INT-1103 are relatively low, similar to CDCA natural analogue. INT-1103 presents<br>
the lower CMC both in water and in presence of counter ion Na+ 150 mM. The low<br>
CMC value of INT-747 is related to the topographic distribution of the ethyl and<br>
hydroxyl groups: the ethyl group in the 6 position is oriented in the β face, the back<br>
of the steroid, contributing to increase the lipophilic extent and area of the surface of<br><br>
this moiety and therefore the tendency to form micelles. INT-1103 presents the<br>
lower CMC as result of ethyl group in 6 position and the 23 sulphate in the side<br>
chain. The peculiar properties of the sulphate group gave to INT-1103 anionic<br>
surfactant like properties (like sodium dodecyl sulphate) as a result of a negative<br>
charged head and lipophilic tail with a surface lipophilic moiety. The values of the<br>
surface tension activity both at CMC and in micellar phase (50 mM) agree with the<br>
present CMC data, both compounds are surface active and able to lower the surface<br>
tension to a great extent in respect to UDCA and TUDCA. This data further supports<br>
the concept that this compounds are detergent like the CDCA analogue and even<br>
more. INT-747 at a relatively high concentration &gt;60 mM and in the presence of<br>
Na+ 0.15 M form a gel phase and this account for the relatively inaccurate ST data<br>
found in that conditions (Fig. 1) These results are not surprising since other detergent<br>
natural BA like deoxycholic acid behave similarly forming this gel (usually<br>
viscoelastic) particularly for the effect of counter ions like Na+ and Ca++ This phase<br>
evolves to micellar phase with a relatively low kinetics. Moreover this phenomenon<br>
occurs at a very high not physiological concentration.<br>
Octanol/water partition coefficient<br>
1-Octanol/water partition coefficient (log P) was evaluated using a conventional<br>
shake-flask procedure. The experiments were carried out on 0.1 mM bile salt<br>
solution buffered at pH 8 with 0.1 M phosphate buffer to ensure complete ionization<br>
of the BA; the log P values refer to the BA in the ionized form, not to the protonated<br>
species, and the initial concentration of each BA was below its own CMC value. The<br>
aqueous buffer was previously pre-saturated with 1-octanol, 5 ml of 1-octanol pre-<br>
saturated with water was then added and the samples were left to equilibrate for 2<br>
weeks under continuous stirring at room temperature After centrifugation the two<br>
phases were carefully separated. BA concentration in the water phase was measured<br>
with HPLC-ESI-MS/MS using C18 column (150mm x 2mm i.d., 4um) and mobile<br><br>
phases: A: water containing 15 mM acetic acid pH 5 , B: acetonitrile. The flow rate<br>
was 150 μl/min and the column was maintained at 45°C. The mass spectrometry<br>
acquisition was performed in the multiple reaction monitoring mode using the ESI<br>
source in negative ionization.<br><br>
The 1-octanol/water partition coefficient was calculated for the ionized species to<br>
facilitate the comparison between the carboxyl and sulphate bile acids since the<br>
latter do not protonated even at very low pH. INT-747 presents a slightly higher<br>
lipophilicity in respect to other dihydroxy bile acids such as UDCA and CDCA. The<br>
increased lipophilicity is the result of the introduction of an ethyl group in position<br>
6. The tendency to distribute in a lipid domain is therefore fisher. The UPF 1103<br>
shows a logP of 2.0, value slightly lower than INT-747 and natural CDCA and<br>
UDCA analogues and this account for the contribution of the sulphate group and<br>
side chain length. Moreover the lipophlicity of INT-1103 is still similar to an<br>
unconjugated BA and higher than taurine conjugated like TCDCA that present a<br>
logP of 0.9. Contrarily to Taurine conjugate which preferentially stay in a water<br>
domain , INT-1103 has a tendency to accumulate in a lipid domain like INT-747.<br>
Albumin binding<br><br>
Albumin binding was evaluated by equilibrium dialysis at a fixed BA-albumin ratio.<br>
BA was dissolved at a concentration of 100 μM in 5% bovine serum albumin-saline<br>
solution and left to stand for 24 h at 25°C. Two ml of this solution was dialyzed in<br>
cellulose sacs having a molecular weight cut-off of 12-14,000 against 25 ml of<br>
saline solution. The system was equilibrated by mechanical shaking for 72 h at<br>
25°C. BA concentrations of the dialyzed solution and of the starting solution were<br>
determined with HPLC-ESI-MS/MS in the same conditions of the previous analysis.<br><br>
Both INT-747 and UPF 1103 present a strong interaction with albumin quite similar<br>
to natural dihydroxy bile acid like CDCA and UDCA suggesting a similar kinetic in<br>
the hepatic uptake. Trihydroxy bile acids like cholic acid or taurine conjugated bile<br>
acids show a lower interaction with albumin and this account to the lower serum<br>
concentration at a similar intestinal uptake as a result of a higher first pass<br>
clearance. The unbound fraction (like for many drugs) modulates the liver uptake: as<br>
the fraction increase the higher is the uptake. INT-747 and INT-1103 present a low<br>
unbound fraction and therefore their serum concentration are higher as a result of a<br>
relatively low first pass clearance, and their behaviour is similar to natural analogs.<br>
Critical micellar pH<br><br>
This value can be experimentally determined by evaluating the pH at which a given<br>
BA starts to precipitate from a micellar solution. It can be calculated from the CMC<br>
Water solubility of the protonated species and pKa using the formula:<br>
CMpH= pKa + log CMC/WS. The CMpH of the studied compounds in comparison<br>
with the natural analogs are reported in Table I.<br><br>
The CMpH value of INT747 is similar to that of CDCA and lower to UDCA.<br>
According to this value INT747 do not present problems of intestinal solubility and<br>
requires a pH of 7.6 which is physiological to go in solution. For example UDCA<br>
with a CMpH of 8.4 requires an higher alkalinization of the duodenal content and<br>
only in post-prandial phase is solubilized in a micellar phase. UP 1103 having a<br>
sulphate group do not present these problems since is always soluble in the<br>
physiological pH from 2 to 9 since the pKa is very low and the compound do not<br>
protonated to form insoluble molecule. Its behaviour is similar to taurine conjugated<br>
bile acids.<br>
Example 12<br>
Hepatic metabolism and secretion of INT-747 and INT-1103 in rat after one<br>
hour iv infusion at a dose of 3μmol/Kg/min<br>
Background<br><br>
The BA were administered by infusion to bile fistula rat and bile collected at 15 min<br>
intervals for 7 hours. The bile flow was measured and bile analyzed using HPLC-<br>
ES-MS-MS for the identification of the rate of biliary secretion and to evaluate the<br>
major hepatic metabolites.<br>
HPLC-ES-MS/MS Method<br>
Bile acids and their metabolites were determined by a liquid chromatography-<br>
tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) method using electrospray (ESI) source<br>
in negative ionization mode. Rat bile samples were brought to room temperature and<br>
diluted 1:100 v/v - 1:1000 v/v with 15 mM ammonium acetate buffer (pH=5). Then,<br>
10 μL were injected into the chromatographic column. Liquid chromatography was<br>
performed using a Waters Alliance 2695 separation module coupled with<br>
autosampler. Bile acids were analyzed using a Synergi Hydro-RP C18 column<br>
(150x2.0mm i.d., 4 μm particle size), protected by a SecurityGuard ODS 4x2.0mm<br>
i.d. precolumn, both supplied from Phenomenex. Bile acids were separated in<br>
elution gradient using 15 mM ammonium acetate buffer (pH = 5.00) as mobile phase<br>
A and acetonitrile as mobile phase B. Mobile phase B was increased from 30% to<br>
64% in 12 min, then to 70% in 8 min, and finally brought to 100% in 10 min and<br>
held constant for 1 min. Flow rate was 150 μL/min and the column was maintained<br>
at 45°C. The column effluent was analysed by ESI-MS/MS using a Quattro-LC<br>
(Micromass) triple quadruple mass spectrometer operating in Multiple Reaction<br>
Monitoring (MRM) acquisition mode. MassLynx software version 4.0 was used for<br>
data acquisition and processing.<br>
Results<br>
INT-747 is secreted into bile mainly as taurine conjugate and its recovery is almost<br>
complete: at the administered dose more than 99 % of the infused molecule is<br>
secreted into bile as shown in fig 3. At the last point of bile collection a relatively<br>
high amount of the taurine conj. compound is still secreted in bile. The maximum<br><br>
secretion rate is achieved after 120 minutes just at the end of the infusion. A steady<br>
state concentration is maintained for additional 30 minutes. The taurine conjugation<br>
process begin very early and appears efficient at the administered dose. Trace<br>
amount of the compound is also conjugate with glycine, less than 0.2% and similar<br>
amount is secreted as such in bile. The behaviour of INT-747 is similar to that of<br>
natural dihydroxy analogs such as CDCA or UDCA which are secreted into bile<br>
only as taurine and glycine conjugates. Differently, trihydroxy BA such as CA, can<br>
be also partially secreted in unconjugated form. The extent of a BA that can be<br>
secreted unmodified is related to its lipophilicity and is dose and species dependent.<br>
The behaviour in term of hepatic uptake and secretion of this molecule is quite<br>
similar to natural analogue like CDCA and the rate of hepatic secretion is related to<br>
that of taurine conjugation mediated by a Co A activation and taurine liver<br>
availability. The preferential conjugation with taurine is peculiar to rat and other<br>
species (dog, mice,..) and in man this compound is amidated mainly with glycine.<br>
According to these date seems that INT-747 is efficiently take up and secreted by<br>
the liver. The hepatic metabolism of INT-747 produces mainly the taurine conjugate<br>
form. Trace amount of glycine conjugate are secreted in bile and also very low<br>
amount is secreted as such, (fig 37 and 38). Minor epimers of both unconjugated and<br>
taurine conjugated are present in bile (fig 39 and 40).<br>
INT-1103 is secreted in bile partially unmodified as reported in fig 41. The amount<br>
of INT-1103 secreted in bile is approx. 30-40% of the administered dose and its<br>
secretion rate is relatively low and at the end of the collection period a relatively<br>
high amount of the molecule is still secreted into bile. The main hepatic metabolite<br>
of INT-1103 in rat at the administered dose is the 3-glucoronide as reported in fig<br>
42. The amount of this compound has not be quantified since the pure reference<br>
standard is not available. Other metabolites are secreted into bile as reported in fig<br><br>
43 and in more details in fig 43 and fig 44. The main identified metabolites is the 3-<br>
sulphate conjugate, an hydroxy analog (one more hydroxyl ) , keto derivatives and<br>
epimers of INT-1103. The exact amount of these compound were not quantified<br>
since the standards are not yet available.<br>
These data suggest that INT-1103 can be secreted in bile as such and its behaviour is<br>
different from natural dihydroxy analogs such as CDCA and INT-747 that require a<br>
conjugation with taurine and glycine to be secreted into bile. This is a main requisite<br>
for molecules with this lipopbilicity. On the contrary trihydrohy BA such as CA or<br>
UCA can be secreted in bile also partially as such. The sulphate group present in<br>
INT1103 facilitate the secretion process even if the molecule is still quite lipophilic<br>
and the behaviour is between an unconjugated and taurine conjugated bile acid.<br>
Moreover the liver strong metabolize this compound forming more hydrophilic<br>
compound such as 3-glucuronides, 3-sulphates and hydroxylated analogs. The<br>
extensive metabolism do to retained compound is related to the animal species and<br>
to the administered dose and according to these data we can speculate that this<br>
compound present a metabolism more similar to an "acids steroids" slightly different<br>
from a common bile acid, but maybe sharing same properties. We do not know the<br>
metabolism in human but if its behaviour is more like a steroid is may be underwent<br>
to 3-glucuronidation even in humans. The compound was administered iv and<br>
addition data are required to evaluate the extent of its intestinal absorption ie passive<br>
or active like a taurine conjugate.<br>
Example 13<br>
In vitro metabolic stability in human stools culture<br>
Stability to Intestinal Bacteria; 7α-dehydroxylation<br>
Homogenized fresh human stools (500 mg) were transferred into sterile vials to<br><br>
which 5 mL of sterilized chopped meat-glucose medium (Scott Lab., Fiskville, RI)<br>
was added. BA were then added at a final concentration of 0.05 mM. Vials were<br>
incubated at 37 C; then, at 0, 4, 8, 16, 20, 24, and 72 h after the addition of the BA,<br>
the reaction was stopped with 150 L of 30% KOH. The samples were centrifuged at<br>
3500 rpm for 10 min; from the supernatant the BA were isolated by C-18 solid-<br>
phase extraction and analyzed by TLC and HPLC-ES-MS/MS. Thin-layer<br>
chromatography (TLC), utilizing silica gel 0.25 m thickness plates (Merck,<br>
Darmstat, Germany), was employed as the first screening test. The solvent system<br>
used for the separation of conjugated BA was composed of propionic acid/isoamyl<br>
acetate/water/N-propanol (3:4:1:2, v/v/v/v; solvent I), and that of the unconjugated<br>
BA was acetic acid/carbon tetrachloride/isopropyl ether/isoamyl acetate/water/N-<br>
propanol/benzene (1:4:6:8:2:2, v/v/v/v/v/v; solvent II). Separated BA were revealed<br>
with 5% phosphomolybdic acid cthanol solution. Both INT-747 and INT-1103 are<br>
very stable when incubated in human stool cultures and even after 24 hour more than<br>
85 % of the compounds can be recovered unmodified as reported in Fig 45 . On the<br>
contrary the reference natural analogue COCA present an half-life time of almost<br>
one hour and after 8 hours of incubation is almost completely metabolized (7-<br>
dehydroxylated) to form lithocholic acid.<br>
Results<br>
These data, shown in Figure 46, suggest that the presence of the ethyl group in the 6<br>
position protect the 7 hydroxyl group toward oxidation or removal by steric<br>
hindrance. In addition both analogues are very stable and particularly INT-1103. The<br>
side chain ester bond is quite stable in the human stool culture. No minor<br>
metabolites have been found by HPLC-ES-MS/MS<br>
Example 14<br>
In vitro metabolic stability in simulated duodenal/pancreatic fluid (USP<br><br>
specification)<br>
Material and Methods<br>
This study has been performed only for INT 1103 since it contain an ester bond in<br>
the side chain and the aim was to verify the stability in presence of esterase enzymes<br>
like present in duodenal and pancreatic juice. Simulated pancreatic fluid was<br>
prepared by dissolving 10 g/L Pancreatin (Sigma P8096: pancreatin from porcine<br>
pancreas, activity 1x USP specifications) in 0.05M phosphate buffer, pH = 7.2 ± 0.1.<br>
Then, 4-mL aliquots of the simulated pancreatic fluid were added of 50 μM INT-<br>
1103 and incubated for different times (0, 30, 60, 90, 120, 180 and 240 min) at<br>
37°C. After incubation, a 2-mL aliquot of each solution was added with 2 mL of<br>
0.1M NaOH and subjected to bile acids extraction by SPE and analysis by thin-layer<br>
chromatography and mass spectrometry as described above.<br><br>
