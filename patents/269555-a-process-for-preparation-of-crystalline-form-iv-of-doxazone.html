AN INDIAN COMPANY<br>
OF 289 BELLASIS ROAD, MUMBAI CENTRAL,<br>
MUMBAI 400 008, MAHARASHTRA<br>
INDIA<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is performed.<br><br>
CRYSTALLINE POLYMORPH OF DOXAZOSIN MESYLATE (FORM IV) AND PROCESS<br>
FOR PREPARATION THEREOF<br>
Field Of Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a novel crystalline form of 1-(4-amino-6,7-dimethoxy-2-<br>
qutnazoliny)-4-(2,3-dihydro-1,4-benzodioxin-2-yl)carbonyl	piperazine<br>
monomethanesulfonate, also known as doxazosin mesylate. More specifically, the invention relates to novel Form IV of doxazosin mesylate, methods for preparing the novel form of doxazosin mesylate and pharmaceutical formulations comprising the novel form of doxazosin mesylate. The structure of doxazosine is shown below.<br><br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Pharmaceutical solids can exist in different crystal forms, such as crystalline, amorphous, or glass and also in solvated or hydrated states (Haleblian et ai, 1969,1975; Kuhnert-Brandstaetter, 1973; Sohn 2004). Polymorphism is the ability of any element or compound to crystallize as more than one distinct crystal species.<br>
It is a well known fact that different polymorphic forms of the same drug may have substantial differences in certain pharmaceutically-important physicochemica! properties, such as stability, solubility, dissolution rate, crystal habit, tableting behavior. Changes in certain of these physiochemical properties may ultimately affect the bioavailability of the<br><br>
drug. Furthermore, different physical forms may have different particle size, hardness and glass transition temperatures.<br>
Regulatory authorities desire to have all possible polymorphic forms of a new drug substance identified prior to approval of a product containing the drug. However, as is well known in the art, the existence of polymorphic forms of any given compound cannot be predicted, and there is no standard procedure for proceeding to make a previously unknown polymorphic form. Even after a polymorph has been identified, there is no possibility of predicting whether any additional forms will ever be discovered. This has been described in many recent articles, including A. Goho, Science News, Vol. 166, No. 8, pages 122-123 (August 2004).<br>
Doxazosin mesyalte is a quinazoline compound, that is a selective inhibitor of the a-1 subtype of a- adrenergic receptors. Jt is known to be useful in men to treat the symptoms of an enlarged prostate (benign prostatic hyperplasia or BPH), which include difficulty urinating (hesitation, dribbling, weak stream, and incomplete bladder emptying), painful urination, and urinary frequency and urgency. Doxazosin (Cardura) is also used alone or in combination with other medications to treat high blood pressure. Doxazosin is in a class of medications called alpha-blockers. It relieves the symptoms of BPH by relaxing the muscles of the bladder and prostate. It lowers blood pressure by relaxing the blood vessels so that blood can flow more easily through the body.<br>
Literature data show that the doxazosin mesylate exists in different crystalline polymorphic forms.<br>
The Chinese Journal of Medicinal Chemistry (1995, 5:266-270) described for the first time three crystal forms: Form A, Form B and Form C.<br>
Subsequently M. Greman et al. (Farmacevtski vestnik ,1997, 48: 292-293) described five different forms, namely A, B, C, D, and E of doxazsin mesylate.<br><br>
Grafe and Morsdorf (CA 02224884, CA 0224916, CA 0222022) disclose methods of preparation of doxazosin mesylate forms which do not correspond to the polymorphic form of the present invention.<br>
   W099/35143 and WO00/56731 claim processes for preparing Form A.<br>
US 2002/0065287 A1 (Giridher et al.) describes two crystal forms A and D.<br>
EP 849264, EP 849265 and EP 849266 disclose three crystalline forms of doxazosin    mesylate Form I, Form II and Form III respectively.<br>
Young-Taek Soh and Yoon-Hee Lee in Arch Pharm Res Journal (Vol 28, No. 6. 730-735, 2005) have recently described nine forms of doxazosin mesylate. The XRD patterns of nine doxazosin mesyalte forms are different from those previously reported  in the<br>
   literature.<br>
Consequently, it would be a significant contribution to the art to provide a crystalline form of doxazosin mesylate, having increased solubility, and methods of preparation, pharmaceutical formulations, and methods of use thereof.<br>

Jn an embodiment, doxazosin mesylate Form IV of the present invention is characterized by having an intrinsic dissolution profile as shown in Figure 4.<br>
To measure the intrinsic dissolution of the doxazosin mesylate Form IV, Form M and Form D, samples were measured to compare the influence of the different parameter settings. At appropriate time intervals, an automated sample collector removes aliquots from dissolution medium for analysis. The time interval for sampling can vary, for example, from<br><br>
2 to 30 minutes, depending on the properties of the drug and dissolution medium used. Suitable dissolution equipment for these operations include LAB INDIA DISSO 2000.<br>
In another aspect, the present invention provides a process for the preparation of doxazosin mesylate Form IV. The doxazosin base used in preparing the polymorph may be obtained by methods described in the prior art which are herein incorporated by reference in their entirety. The doxazosin used as a starting material can be in any form, e.g. it can be in a reaction solution, suspension, crude or in anhydrous, hydrated or solvated form.<br>
Form IV doxazosin mesylate may be prepared by dissolving doxazosin base of any form, or in a mixture of any forms, with methane sulfonic acid in an polar aprotic solvent. The reaction mass may be stirred for about 30 minutes to about 5 hours at a temperature of about 256C to boiling temperature of the solvent. The Form IV produced in the reaction solution may be isolated by cooling at around room temperature and stirring for a prolonged time period. Examples of prolonged time periods include, but are not limited to, 30 minutes to a few hours, such as 2 hours, or to a few days, such as 2 days. In an embodiment, the second prolonged period is from about 1 hour to about days, preferably from about 1 hour to about 1 day, more preferably from about 1 hour to about 3 hours.<br>
The solvent employed in this process are polar aprotic solvents and may be selected from tetrahydrofuran, acetone, 1,4-dioxane, dimethylformamide, dimethyfsulfoxide and N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone. In a preferred embodiment the solvent is acetone.<br>
The reaction is preferably performed at a temperature ranging from about 25°C to about 40°C. Preferably, the reaction is performed at a temperature ranging from about 30 to about 40°C. Typically the reaction time ranges from about 2 to about 4 hours. The precipitated Form IV may be isolated by filtration, for example by either gravity or suction. The precipitate may be dried at room temperature and/or in vacuum to obtain Form IV.<br><br>
The novel polymorph of doxazosin mesylate obtained according to the present invention is substantially free from other crystal and non-crystal forms of doxazosin mesylate. -Substantially free- from other forms of doxazosin mesylate shall be understood to mean that the polymorphs of doxazosin mesylate contain less than 10%, preferably less than 5%, of any other forms of doxazosin mesylate and less than 1% of other impurities, water or solvates. Thus, the doxazosine mesylate Form IV prepared according to the present invention contains less than 11% total impurities, preferably less than 6% total impurities. In a particularly preferred embodiment, the doxazosine mesylate Form IV prepared according to the present invention contains less than 1% total impurities. For example, the doxazosine mesylate Form IV prepared according to the processes described in Examples 1 and 2 below are 99.89% and 99.91%, respectively.<br>
The process of invention may be used as a method for purifiying any form of doxazosin mesylate, as well as for the preparation of the new polymorphic form IV.<br>
Doxazosin mesylate has been found to be effective for the control of elevated blood pressure (hypertension) and for benign prostatic hyperplasia (noncancerous enlargement of the prostate gland). Pharmaceutical compositions according to the present invention comprise Form IV doxazosin mesylate as an active ingredient together with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, excipients or diluents. Any conventional technique may be used for the preparation of pharmaceutical compositions according to the invention.<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions may be formulated for oral delivery in the form of tablets. Pharmaceutical compositions according to the present invention may preferably comprise 1mg, 2mg, 4mg, or 8mg of active ingredient along with a pharmaceuticalfy acceptable carrier. Doxazosin mesylate tablets of the present invention may be taken with or without food on the same time each day to maintain proper blood levels.<br>
The invention is further described by reference to the following examples, which set forth in  detail  certain  aspects  and  embodiments  of the   preparation  of compounds  and<br><br>
compositions of the present invention. It will be apparent to those skilled in the art, that many modifications, both to materials and methods, can be practiced without departing from the purpose and intent of this invention. The examples that follow are not intended to limit the scope of the invention as described herein above or as claimed below.<br>
Examples<br>
Example 1<br>
Preparation of doxazosin mesylate Form IV<br>
Doxazosin (100 gms) was charged in acetone (0.8 lit) at room temperature. The contents were stirred for 10 mins at 25-30°C. Methane sulfonic acid (23.2 ml) was charged slowly at 25-30°C. The reaction mass was heated at 35-38°C and the temperature maintained for 2 hours. The reaction mass was cooled to 25-30°C and stirred for 1 hour. The solid obtained was filtered and washed with acetone (100 ml). The product was dried at 55-60°C under vacuum to obtain pure Form IV doxazosin mesylate (115-120 gms) which was characterized by XRD, IR and DSC. Purity according to HPLC:- 99.89%<br>
Example 2<br>
Preparation of doxazosin mesylate Form IV<br>
Doxazosin mesylate (100 gms) was charged in methanol (1.0 lit) at room temperature. The contents were heated to reflux for 1 hour. The reaction mass was cooled to room temperature and stirred further for 1 hour. The product was isolated by vacuum filtration and dried under vacuum at 55-60°C to obtain pure Form IV doxazosin mesylate (85 gms) which was characterized by XRD, IR and DSC. Purity according to HPLC:- 99.91%<br>
Example 3<br>
Comparative Intrinsic Dissolution Study<br><br>
A tableting mixture (50 mg) comprising solely doxazosin mesylate (i.e. with no excipients) was prepared and compressed to a pellet using a manual hand press operating at a compression pressure of 5 tones for 5 minutes.<br>
In-vitro dissolutions studies were performed on the 50 mg pellet in a LAB INDIA DiSSO 2000.<br>
The pellet was fixed in a PFTE holder, such that only the pellet surface came into contact with the dissolution medium. The PFTE loaded holder was placed in the dissolution vessel containing 900 ml of 0.01N HCI at 37±0.5°C. Three pellets were measured for each run of the design of the experiments. Stirring was performed with a paddle rotating at 50 rpm. The dissolution was followed up to 1440 min and the concentration of active ingredient, doxazosin mesylate, dissolved in the test medium was determined by removing samples of 10 ml at the specified time.<br>
The concentration of doxazosin mesylate was quantified by HPLC UV method at a<br>
maximum wavelength of 245 nm under conditions as specified:<br>
Mobile Phase	: 450:450:100:: Buffer:MeOH:Acetonitrile<br>
Buffer	: 0.3% v/v Diethyiamine. The pH adjusted to 2.5 with orthophosphoric<br>
acid<br>
Column	: Inersil ODS 15 cm<br>
Flow	: 1.0 ml/min<br>
The percentage of doxazosin mesylate released was plotted against time. The intrinsic dissolution rate was derived from the slope of this curve.<br>
When compared with known forms of doxazosin mesylate, Form M and Form D, the new form IV exhibited a superior rate of dissolution as shown in Table 2 below. The peak<br><br>
dissolution of 81.1 % was achieved at 720 mins for the new from IV; whereas, at the same time, 67.0 % was achieved for form M and 74.5% for Form D.<br>
