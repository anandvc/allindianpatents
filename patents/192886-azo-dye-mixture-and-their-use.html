The compounds of the formulae (1) and (2) are known in some cases from EβA-647683 or<br>
can be prepared analogously to these compounds. The compounds of the formula (2)<br>
defined above in which<br>
Ti is halogen and<br>
Vi is βsulfoethylamino or βhydroxyethylamino and<br>
Ri, R2, R3 and Z^ are each as defined and preferred above,<br>
are novel and the invention also relates to these compounds.<br>
The compounds of the formulae (1) and (2) can be synthesized, for example, by diazotizing a compound of the formula<br><br>
in which V, T and Z are each as defined above,<br>
in a manner known per se, for example with sodium nitrite in a hydrochloric acid medium,<br>
and coupling the diazotization product with a coupling component of the formula<br><br>
in which K, Ri, R2 and R3 are each as defined above.<br>
For the preparation of compounds of the formula (2) in which R3 is sulfomethyl, it may prove advantageous to employ in the process, instead of the coupling component of the formula (8b), a coupling component of the formula<br><br><br>
The dyes of the formulae (1) and (2) used according to the invention each contain at least one sulfo group and preferably in each case 1 to 3 sulfo groups which are each present either in the form of the free sulfo acid or, preferably, as a salt thereof, for example as the sodium, lithium, potassium or ammonium salt or as the salt of an organic amine, for example as the triethanolammonium salt. The dyes of the formulae (1) and (2) and therefore also the dye mixtures as a rule comprise further additives, for example sodium chloride or dextrine.<br>
The dyes of the formulae (1) and (2) are present in the dye mixture, for example in a weight ratio of 25:1 to 1:1, preferably 20:1 to 1:1, and particularly preferably 10:1 to 1.5:1.<br>
The dye mixtures according to the invention can be prepared, for example, by mixing the individual dyes. This mixing process is carried out, for example, in suitable mills, for example ball or pinned disc mills, and in kneaders or mixers.<br><br>
Dye mixtures comprising in each case a compound of the formulae (1) and (2) in which T and Ti, V and Vi and Z and Zi are in each case identical can advantageously also be obtained by mixed synthesis, i.e. by reacting a compound of the formula (7) defined above with a mixture of coupling components of the formulae (8a) and (8b) or (8c) defined above.<br>
The invention also relates to a process for dyeing or printing fibre materials containing hydroxyl groups or nitrogen with the dye mixtures according to the invention.<br>
Fibre materials are, for example, the naturally occurring cellulosic fibres, such as cotton, linen, jute or hemp, and modified cellulosic fibres, such as cellulose or regenerated cellulose. The dye mixtures according to the invention are particularly suitable for dyeing or printing naturally occurring polyamide fibre materials, for example silk or wool, synthetic polyamide fibre materials, for example nylon 6 or nylon 6.6, or wool and synthetic polyamide blend fabrics. The dye mixtures according to the invention are particularly suitable for dyeing or printing naturally occurring polyamide fibre materials, and here in particular wool or wool which has been chlorinated or given a machine-washable treatment.<br>
The textile fibre material mentioned can be present here in widely varying processing forms, for example as fibre, yarn, flocks, woven fabric or knitted fabric. The dye mixtures according to the invention are suitable for the customary dyeing and printing processes and can be applied to and fixed on the fibre material in many different ways, in particular in the form of aqueous dye solutions or dye printing pastes. They are suitable both for the exhaust method and for pad dyeing, in which the goods are impregnated with aqueous dye solutions, which may contain salts, and the dyes are fixed after an alkali treatment or in the presence of alkali, where appropriate under the action of heat. The dye mixtures according to the invention are also suitable for the cold pad-batch method, in which the dye is applied on the padder together with the alkali and then fixed by storage at room temperature for several hours.<br>
Naturally occurring and synthetic polyamide fibre materials, in particular wool, are preferably dyed by the exhaust method at a pH of about 3 to 7, in particular 3 to 5, and at temperatures of, for example, 70 to 120°C, in particular 90 to 105°C.<br><br>
In addition to water and the dyes of the formulae (1) and (2), the dye liquors or printing pastes can comprise further additives, for example shading dyes, salts, buffer substances, wetting agents, antifoams, levelling agents or agents which influence the properties of the textile material, for example softeners, additives for flameproofing treatment or soil-, water-and oil-repellant agents, as well as water-softening agents and naturally occurring or synthetic thickeners, for example alginates or cellulose ethers, all of which are known per se.<br>
Dye mixtures which have proved advantageous are, for example, those comprising 90 to 25 % by weight, and preferably 90 to 50 % by weight, of a dye mixture comprising one compound each of the formulae (1) and (2) defined above and 10-75 % by weight, and preferably 10 to 50 % by weight, in each case based on the total solid dye formulation, of a dye of the formula<br><br>
in which Y is as defined and preferred above.<br>
The dye mixtures according to the invention produce level dyeings and prints with good all-round properties, in particular good fastness to washing, rubbing, wet processing, wet rubbing and light. The dye mixtures according to the invention are furthermore distinguished by a uniform colour build-up, good uptake properties and high degrees of fixing. Furthermore, the otherwise customary after-treatment of the dyeings and prints with so-called fixing agents can be omitted with the dye mixtures according to the invention.<br>
In the following examples, parts are by weight. The temperatures are degrees Celsius. Parts by weight and parts by volume bear the same relationship to one another as the gram to the cubic centimetre.<br>
Example 1: 10 g of woollen fabric are dyed in a laboratory dyeing apparatus with the following liquor:<br><br>
0.2g of sodium acetate<br>
0.5g of 80% acetic acid<br>
0.2g of a commercially available levelling agent (Albegal B*)<br>
0.3 g of a dye mixture comprising 80 % by weight of the dye of the formula<br><br>
and   200 ml of water.<br>
The pH of the liquor is 4.5. The textile is treated in the dye liquor at 40°C for 5 minutes, the liquor is then heated to the boiling temperature (98°C) at a heating-up rate of l7mlnute, and dyeing is carried out at this temperature for 90 minutes. After the liquor has cooled to 80°C, the dyeing is rinsed and finished in the customary manner. A black dyeing which is level over the fibre and surface and has good fastness properties is obtained.<br>
Example 2: 10g of a woollen tricot treated to superwash standard by the Hercoset process is dyed in a laboratory dyeing apparatus with the following liquor:<br>
0.2g of sodium acetate<br>
0.5g of 80% acetic acid<br><br>
0.5g of Glauber's salt<br>
0.2g of a commercially available levelling agent (Albegal B*)<br>
0.4 g of a dye mixture comprising 75 % by v^/eight of the dye of the formula<br><br>
and   200 ml of water.<br>
The pH of the liquor is 4.7. The textile material is treated in the dye liquor at 40°C for 5 minutes and the liquor is then heated to 60°C at a heating-up rate of l7minute and kept at 60°C for 20 minutes. It is then heated to the boiling temperature (98°C) at l7minute and dyeing is carried out at this temperature for 90 minutes. After cooling, the textile material is treated in a fresh liquor comprising 5 g/l of sodium bicarbonate at 80°C and pH 8.3 for 20 minutes. It is then rinsed in the customary manner and 1 % formic acid, based on the fibre weight, is added to the last rinsing bath for acidification. A black dyeing which is level over the fibre and surface and has good fastness properties is obtained.<br>
Example 3; 5 g of loose wool are dyed in a laboratory dyeing apparatus with the following liquor:<br>
0.2 g of sodium acetate<br><br>
0.5 g of 80 % acetic acid<br>
0.2 g of a commercially available levelling agent (Albegal B®)<br>
105 mg of a dye mixture comprising 75 parts of the dye of the formula<br><br>
and   400 ml of water.<br>
The pH of the liquor is 4.7. The material is treated in the dye liquor at 40°C for 5 minutes, the liquor is then heated to the boiling temperature (98°C) at a heating-up rate of rc/minute, and dyeing is carried out at this temperature for 90 minutes. After cooling the liquor to 80°C, the dyeing is rinsed and finished in the customary manner. A black dyeing which is level over the fibre and surface and has good fastness properties is obtained.<br>
Example 4: 1 kg of woollen worsted yarn in the form of a cheese is pretreated in a circulating apparatus at 40°C for 10 minutes with a liquor comprising<br>
9 I of water,<br>
9 g of ammonium acetate,<br>
37 ml of 80 % acetic acid,<br>
9 g of a nonionic wetting agent (Albegal FFA®), and<br><br>
20 g of a commercialiy available levelling agent (Albegal B®). The pH of the liquor is 4.65. After addition of a solution which comprises 24 g of the dye of the formula<br><br>
the yarn is treated in the dye liquor at 40°C for 5 minutes and the liquor is then heated to 70°C with a heating-up rate of 1°C/minute and kept at 70°C for 15 minutes. It is then heated to the boiling temperature (98°C) at 1°/minute and dyeing is carried out at this temperature<br><br>
for 90 minutes. After cooling, the textile material is treated at 80°C for 20 minutes in a fresh liquor brought to pH 8.5 with 35 g of 35 % ammonia. It is then rinsed in the customary manner and 1 % of formic acid, based on the fibre weight, is added to the last rinsing bath for acidification. A black dyeing which is level over the fibre and surface and has good fastness properties is obtained.<br>
Example 5: The procedure described in Example 4 is repeated, but 4 % by weight, based on the textile material, of a commercially available wool-protecting agent (Irgasol HTW®) is additionally added to the dye liquor, dyeing is carried out at 105°C and the dyeing time is shortened to 45 minutes. A black dyeing which is level over the fibre and surface and has good fastness properties is likewise obtained.<br>
Example 6: The procedure described in Example 1 is repeated using as the dye 500 mg of a mixture of 85 parts of the dye of the formula<br><br><br>
Example 7: The procedure described in Example 1 is repeated using as the dye 350 mg of a mixture of 65 parts of the dye of the formula<br><br>
A black dyeing which is level over the fibre and surface and has good fastness properties is likewise obtained.<br>
Example 8: The procedure described in Example 1 is repeated using as the dye 400 mg of a mixture of 70 parts of the dye of the formula<br><br><br>
and 30 parts of the dye of the formula<br><br>
A black dyeing which is level over the fibre and surface and has good fastness properties is likewise obtained.<br>
Example 9: The procedure described in Example 4 is repeated using, instead of the shading dye of the formula (10), 1.25 g of the dye of the formula<br><br>
A black dyeing which is level over the fibre and surface and has good fastness properties is likewise obtained<br>
Example 10:10 g of a woollen tricot treated to superwash standard by the Hercoset process is dyed in a laboratory dyeing apparatus with the following liquor:<br>
0.2 g of sodium acetate<br>
0.5 g of 80 % acetic acid<br>
0.5 g of Glauber's salt<br><br>
0.2 g of a commercially available levelling agent (Aibegal B®) 0.4 g of a dye mixture comprising<br>
45 % by weight of the dye of the formula<br><br>
and 200 ml of water.<br>
The pH of the liquor is 4.7. The textile material is treated in the dye liquor at 40°C for 5 minutes and the liquor is then heated to 60°C at a heating-up rate of 17minute and kept at 60°C for 20 minutes. It is then heated to the boiling temperature (98°C) at l7minute and dyeing is carried out at this temperature for 90 minutes. After cooling, the textile material is treated in a fresh liquor comprising 5 g/l of sodium bicarbonate at 80°C and at pH 8.3 for 20 minutes. (Alternatively, the treatment can be carried out with ammonia, sodium carbonate or<br><br>
sodium hydroxide solution, in each case at a pH of 7.5 to 9). The dyeing is rinsed in the customary manner and 1 % of formic acid, based on the fibre weight, is added to the last rinsing bath for acidification. A black dyeing which is level over the fibre and surface and has good fastness properties is obtained.<br><br>
