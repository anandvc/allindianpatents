				<td>METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR REARRANGING CODEWORD SEQUENCE IN A COMMUNICATION SYSTEM<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates generally to a communication system using multi-level modulation/demodulation, and in particular, to a method and apparatus for rearranging a bit stream of a codeword sequence before modulation, and arranging an output of a demodulator in the form of an original codeword sequence.<br>
2.	Description of the Related Art<br>
An IMT-2000 (International Mobile Telecommunication-2000) system or a UMTS (Universal Mobile Telecommunication System) system, a typical CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access) mobile communication system, uses multi-level modulation/demodulation in order to increase spectral efficiency. Here, the "multi-level modulation" refers to 8PSK (8-ary Phase Shift Keying), 16QAM (16-ary Quadrature Amplitude Modulation) and 64QAM modulations as 2ni-ary modulation having a higher modulation level than QPSK (Quadrature Phase Shift Keying) modulation. When generating modulated bits using the multi-level modulation, there occurs a difference in reliability between a plurality of bits constituting each modulated bit. Due to the reliability difference, the respective bits have different average bit error rates.<br>
Meanwhile, when an encoder comprised of a plurality of system encoders, such as a turbo encoder, is used as a channel encoder, codeword bits from the system encoders are divided into a systematic part, a stream of bits with higher priority (importance), and a parity part, a stream of bits with lower priority.<br>
In the case where one information sequence is input to a plurality of constituent encoders, a decrease in a bit error rate of bits belonging to the systematic part of the codeword bits may result in a decrease in an average bit error rate and an average packet error rate of an information sequence output from a channel decoder. That is, when the codeword bits belonging to the systematic part with higher priority assuredly have higher reliability than the codeword bits belonging to the parity part with lower priority, it is possible to expect a performance improvement in terms of an error rate of an information sequence generated after decoding.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is, therefore, an object of the present invention to provide a method and apparatus for rearranging bits of a codeword sequence output from a channel encoder before modulation, such that bits belonging to a systematic part with higher priority are arranged in bit positions with higher reliability of a modulated bit, in a communication system using multi-level modulation.<br>
It is another object of the present invention to provide a method and apparatus for rearranging bits of a codeword sequence output from a channel encoder before modulation, such that bits belonging to a systematic part with higher priority are arranged in bit positions with higher reliability of a modulated bit, and arranging a demodulated bit in the order of an original codeword sequence, in a communication system using multi-level modulation.<br>
It is further another object of the present invention to provide a method and apparatus for improving an average bit error rate and an average packet error rate of an information sequence generated after decoding, in a communication<br>
system.<br>
To achieve the above and other objects, there is provided a method and apparatus for mapping a stream of bits output from an encoder to a stream of bits for 2m-ary modulation. The method and apparatus divides the stream of bits from the encoder into a first period and a second period. The first period includes bits with higher priority in the stream of the bits output from the encoder, and the second period includes bits with lower priority. The method and apparatus maps the bits existing in the first period to bit positions with higher reliability in a stream of m bits representing each of the bits for 2m-ary modulation, and maps the bits existing in the second period to bit positions with lower reliability in the stream of m bits.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
A preferred embodiment of the present invention will be described herein below with reference to the accompanying drawings. In the following description, well-known functions or constructions are not described in detail since they would obscure the invention in unnecessary detail.<br>
The present invention provides (1) a method for rearranging bits of a codeword sequence output from a channel encoder before modulation such that the bits with higher reliability, such as the bits belonging to a systematic part, are arranged in positions with higher reliability among the bits constituting a modulated bit, in a communication system using multi-level modulation/demodulation such as 8PSK, 16QAM and 64QAM having a higher modulation level than QPSK, (2) a method for arranging output values of a demodulator in original positions of the codeword sequence, and (3) an apparatus for performing the methods. If a channel interleaver is not used in the following stage of the channel encoder or if, though a channel interleaver is used, an interleaved sequence can be divided into a systematic part with higher priority and a parity part with lower priority, then the present invention can improve system performance by utilizing a method for rearranging output bits of the channel encoder or the channel interleaver before modulation by taking into consideration a reliability difference between bits in the multi-level modulation/demodulation, and by arranging output values of a demodulator in the original positions before channel decoding or channel deinterleaving. Herein, first, a description will be made of a transmission apparatus for rearranging a codeword sequence according to an embodiment of the present invention, and a<br>
reception apparatus corresponding to the transmission apparatus. Next, an operation of rearranging a codeword sequence according to different embodiments of the present invention will be described. The description of the codeword sequence rearranging operation will be made from two different perspectives. Embodiments A-l, A-2, A-3, B-l, B-2 and B-3 based on a first perspective demonstrate how the codeword sequence rearranging operation is performed from the perspective of the codeword sequences. Embodiments C-l, C-2, C-3, D-l, D-2 and D-3 based on a second perspective demonstrate how the codeword sequence rearranging operation is performed from the perspective of the modulated bits. The embodiments based on the first perspective will be described on the assumption that the codeword sequence has N bits, and the embodiments based on the second perspective will be described on the assumption that the number of modulated bits is N. Although the codeword sequence rearranging operation according to the present invention will be described from two different perspectives, it should be noted that both operations are substantially identical to each other. Finally, performance of the codeword sequence rearranging operation according to the present invention will be analyzed.<br>
FIG. 1 illustrates a structure of a transmission apparatus including a sequence mapper for rearranging a codeword sequence according to an embodiment of the present invention. Referring to FIG. 1, a channel encoder 110 encodes an input information bit stream, and outputs a codeword sequence comprised of a plurality of bit streams. For example, a turbo encoder can be used as the channel encoder 110. A channel interleaver 120 interleaves the codeword sequence output from the channel encoder 110, and outputs an interleaved codeword sequence. A sequence mapper 130, a particular element according to the present invention, rearranges the codeword sequence for modulation according to different embodiments of the present invention. A modulator 140 modulates the codeword sequence rearranged by the sequence mapper 130<br>
according to a corresponding modulation technique, and generates modulated bits. The modulator 140 is a multi-level modulator using the multi-level (2m-ary) modulation such as 8PSK, 16QAM and 64QAM. A codeword sequence rearranging operation by the sequence mapper 130 can be determined depending on the modulation technique of the modulator 140. That is, the sequence mapper 130 performs the codeword sequence rearranging operation according to one of the 8PSK, 16QAM and 64QAM modulations, used by the modulator 140.<br>
FIG. 2 illustrates a structure of a reception apparatus including a sequence demapper according to an embodiment of the present invention. The reception apparatus, corresponding to the transmission apparatus of FIG. 1, includes elements corresponding to the elements of the transmission apparatus and performing reverse operations of the corresponding elements of the transmitter.<br>
Referring to FIG. 2, a demodulator 210, an element corresponding to the modulator 140, demodulates received information and outputs a demodulated bit. A sequence demapper 220, an element corresponding to the sequence mapper 130, arranges the demodulated bit from the demodulator 210 in the order of the original codeword sequence before being rearranged by the sequence mapper 130. A channel deinterleaver 230, an element corresponding to the channel interleaver 120, deinterleaves the codeword sequence from the sequence demapper 220. A channel decoder 240, an element corresponding to the channel encoder 110, decodes the output of the channel deinterleaver 230. A turbo decoder can be used as the channel decoder 240.<br>
Before a detailed description of the present invention, reference will be made to how the sequence mapper 130 according to the present invention maps (or constellates) the input codeword sequence according to the modulation techniques. The codeword sequence may be either a codeword sequence directly<br>
output from the channel encoder 110 of FIG. 1, or a codeword sequence interleaved by the channel interleaver 120 after being encoded by the channel interleaver 110 as illustrate in FIG. 1. Therefore, the term "codeword sequence" as used herein refers to a codeword sequence output from the channel encoder 110, or a codeword sequence interleaved by the channel interleaver 120 after being encoded by the channel interleaver 110.<br>
During modulation, the codeword sequence output from the channel encoder 110 is divided by m bits, and then constellated to a specific signal point among M=2m signal points according to, for example, Gray coding rule. This can be expressed by<br>
In Equation (1), Sj (i=0,l,-",m-l) represents an (i+l)th bit of the codeword sequence output from the channel encoder, constellated to one modulated bit. Further, I and Q represent an in-phase component and a quadrature-phase component of the corresponding modulated bit, respectively. In the case of 8PSK modulation, m-3. In the case of 16QAM and 64QAM modulations, m-4 and 6, respectively.<br>
In the multi-level modulation, reliabilities between bits constituting one modulated bit are different from one another. This is because error probabilities due to a distance difference up to a region where each bit value of the modulated bit constellated to a specific position on the I-Q plane can be inverted by noises that are different from one another. Due to this phenomenon, LLRs (Log Likelihood Ratios) of the respective bits have different values, causing a reduction in performance of the channel decoder that expects soft values for the bits having the same error rate.<br>
In the case of 8PSK, 2 of 3 bits constituting one modulated bit have the same reliability, whereas the remaining one bit has lower reliability than the other bits. For example, when a signal constellation diagram for 8PSK of FIG. 3 is applied, a second bit s, and a third bit s2 among the 3 bits have higher reliability than a first bit s0. In the case of 16QAM, 2 of 4 bits constituting one modulated bit have higher reliability than the remaining 2 bits. For example, when a signal constellation diagram for 16QAM of FIG. 4 is applied, a second bit s, and a fourth bit s3 among the 4 bits have higher reliability than a first bit s0 and a third bit s2. In the case of 64QAM, 6 bits have different reliabilities in pairs. For example, when a signal constellation diagram for 64QAM of FIG. 5 is applied, a third bit s2 and a sixth bit s5 among the 6 bits have higher reliability than a second bit s, and a fifth bit s4, and a first bit s0 and a fourth bit s3 have the lowest reliability. However, the bit positions having different reliabilities may depend on the signal constellation diagram applied.<br>
First, a description will be made of an operation of rearranging bits of a codeword sequence output from a channel encoder or a channel interleaver before modulation.<br>
Principle of Invention<br>
A fundamental principle of rearrangement according to the present invention is to rearrange the codeword sequence output from the channel encoder or the channel interleaver such that as many bits with higher priority as possible, such as the codeword bits belonging to a systematic part, are arranged in the bit positions with higher reliability of the bits representing a modulated bit. Bit rearrangement on the codeword sequence to be performed before generation of the modulated bit can be differently applied depending on the form of power to be allocated to the codeword sequence, observing the above principle.<br>
Embodiments Based on First Viewpoint<br>
A description of the bit rearrangement operation according to embodiments of the present invention will be separately made for one case where power is uniformly allocated to the codeword sequence and another case where different power levels are allocated to the front part and the rear part of the codeword sequence. Further, a description of each case will be separately made for 8PSK, 16QAM and 64QAM. In the following description of the bit rearrangement operation, it will be assumed that one codeword sequence is comprised of N bits, and N is a multiple of 3 for 8PSK modulation, a multiple of 4 for 16QAM modulation, and a multiple of 6 for 64QAM modulation. In addition, the codeword sequence before rearrangement is represented by {dQ,dl,---,dk,—,du.2,dN.l}, and the codeword sequence after rearrangement is represented by {b0,b,,---,bk,---,bN.2,bN.1}. Moreover, it will be assumed that the codeword sequence before rearrangement, i.e., the output codeword sequence of the channel encoder or the channel interleaver is arranged in the order of the systematic part and the parity part. If the codeword sequence is not arranged in the order of the systematic part and the parity part, a separate straightforward pre-processing to achieve this ordering is performed first.<br>
A. Power Being Uniformly Allocated to Codeword Sequence When the power is uniformly allocated to the codeword sequence, it is possible to achieve performance improvement in terms of an average packet error rate by utilizing the intact rearrangement principle. FIG. 6 illustrates a case where the power is uniformly allocated to the codeword sequence.<br>
Embodiment A-l (for 8PSK Modulation<br>
As mentioned before, 2 of 3 bits constituting one 8PSK-modulated bit have higher reliability than the remaining 1 bit. If it is assumed that the signal constellation diagram of FIG. 3 is used, a second bit s, and a third bit s2 have higher reliability than a first bit s0. In this case, an operation of rearranging the<br>
output codeword sequence of the channel encoder or the channel interleaver before modulation by the sequence mapper 130 of FIG. 1 is performed as follows.<br>
1.	For the bits in a first period, the sequence mapper 130 sequentially<br>
maps first to {(2/3)xN}th bits to positions of a second bit s, and a third bit s2 in<br>
each of (N/3) modulated bits.<br>
2.	For the bits in a second period, the sequence mapper 130 sequentially<br>
maps the remaining {(2/3)xN+l }th to Nth bits to a position of a first bit s0 in each<br>
of (N/3) modulated bits.<br>
These processes are summarized into Equations (2) and (3). The bits of the codeword sequence before rearrangement are rearranged as shown in FIG. 9.<br>
b3xLk/2&gt;(kmod2)+i = 4, for k 
b(3xk).(2xN) = die. for k &gt; (2/3)xN   ........... (3)<br>
In the Equations (2) and (3), 'A mod B' indicates a remainder obtained by dividing A by B, and |_Xj indicates a maximum integer less than X.<br>
FIG. 9 illustrates a bit rearrangement operation for 8PSK modulation in which power is uniformly allocated to the codeword sequence according to an embodiment of the present invention. Referring to FIG. 9, a codeword sequence comprised of an N-bit stream is divided into a first period and a second period. The first period is a duration between a first bit d0 and a {(2/3)xN}th bit d2N/3.1 of the codeword sequence, and the second period is a duration between a {(2/3)xN+l}th bit d2N/3 and an Nth bit dN., of the codeword sequence. Here, the modulated bit is comprised of 3 bits, and the number of modulated bits<br>
corresponding to the codeword sequence is N/3.<br>
A first bit d0 in the first period of the codeword sequence is mapped to a second bit position m0,S| (i.e. bj) of a first modulated bit, and a second bit d] in the first period of the codeword sequence is mapped to a third bit position m0,s2 (i.e. b2) of the first modulated bit. A third bit d2 in the first period is mapped to a second bit position m^s, (i.e. b4) of a second modulated bit, and a fourth bit d3 in the first period is mapped to a third bit position m,,s2 (i.e. b5) of the second modulated bit. A {(2/3)xN-l}th bit d2N/3.2 in the first period is mapped to a second bit position m^.]^ (i.e. bN.2) of an (N/3)th modulated bit, the last modulated bit, and a {(2/3)xN}th bit d2N/3.,, the last bit in the first period is mapped to a third bit position mN/M,s2 (i.e. bN_i) of the last modulated bit.<br>
A {(2/3)xN+l}th bit d2N/3, a first bit in the second period is mapped to a first bit position m0,s0 (i.e. b0) of the first modulated bit, and a {(2/3)xN+2}th bit d2N/3+.,, a second bit in the second period is mapped to a first bit position mbs0 of the second modulated bit. An (N-l)th bit dN.2 in the second period is mapped to a first bit position mN/3.2,s0 (i.e. bN_6) of an {N/3-l}th modulated bit, and an Nth bit dN.|, the last bit in the second period is mapped to a first bit position mN/3.,,s0 (i.e. bN.3) of an (N/3)th modulated bit, the last modulated bit.<br>
FIG. 10 illustrates a procedure for performing a bit rearrangement operation for 8PSK modulation in which power is uniformly allocated to the codeword sequence according to an embodiment of the present invention. This procedure is performed by the sequence mapper 130 of FIG. 1.<br>
Referring to FIG. 10, the sequence mapper 130 sets k to zero (k=0) in step 301. The sequence mapper 130 determines in step 302 whether k is less than {(2/3)xN|. If k is less than {(2/3)xN}, the sequence mapper 130 performs an<br>
operation of step 303. Otherwise, the sequence mapper 130 performs an operation of step 304.

B. Different Power Levels Being Allocated to Front Part and Rear Part of Codeword Sequence<br>
A description of an operation for the case where the power is non-uniformly allocated to the codeword sequence can be separately made for the following two cases.<br>
In a first case, a higher power level is applied to the front part of the codeword sequence, while a lower power level is applied to the rear part of the codeword sequence. Such power allocation is illustrated in FIG. 7. In this case, the output bits of the channel encoder or the channel interleaver are rearranged in the same method described above as used when the power is uniformly allocated to the codeword sequence. This is because when the power is unavoidably non-uniformly allocated to the codeword sequence, it is preferable to allocate a higher power level to the systematic part and a lower power level to the parity part in order to secure better performance.<br>
In a second case, to the contrary, a lower power level is applied to the front part of the codeword sequence, while a higher power level is applied to the rear part of the codeword sequence. Such power allocation is illustrated in FIG. 8. In this case, the bit rearrangement method used when the power is uniformly allocated to the codeword sequence is modified because allocating a higher power level to the systematic part shows better performance than allocating a higher power level to the parity part. That is, in order to allocate a higher power level to the systematic part, it is necessary to arrange a specific part of the codeword sequence to the bit positions with the same reliability in an order that is reversed with respect to the order as described in the cases described above. An operation of this case will be described with reference to the respective modulation techniques.<br>

If k is larger than or equal to {(l/3)xN) and less than {(2/3)xN), the sequence mapper 130 performs an operation of step 805. Otherwise, the sequence mapper 130 performs an operation of step 806. In step 803, the sequence mapper 130 performs bit mapping on the codeword sequence in accordance with Equation (13). In step 805, the sequence mapper 130 performs bit mapping on the codeword sequence in accordance with Equation (14). In step 806, the sequence mapper 130 performs bit mapping on the codeword sequence in accordance with Equation (15). The operations of steps 803, 805 and 806 are repeatedly performed until it is determined in step 807 that the bit mapping has been completely performed on all the bits of the codeword sequence. That is, if it is determined in step 807 that k is less than N, the sequence mapper 130 increases k by 1 in step 808, and then returns to step 802.<br>
Heretofore, the description has been made of the operation of rearranging the output codeword sequence bits of the channel encoder or the channel interleaver before modulation according to the embodiments of the present invention. Next, a description will be made of an operation of arranging output values of a demodulator in the order of the original codeword sequence before channel decoding or channel deinterleaving.<br>
The operation of arranging the output values of the demodulator in the order of the original codeword sequence is achieved by reversly performing the above-described rearranging operation. If an output sequence of the demodulator is represented by {qo^b-^qk^'sClN-i^N-ilj the sequence arranged in the original<br>
order before channel decoding or channel deinterleaving is represented by {po,pi,-",pk,"-,pN.2,pN-i}, a subscript of the left term b in Equations (2) to (15) is represented by m, and a subscript of the right term d is represented by n, then a process of arranging output sequence values of the demodulator in the original order before channel decoding or channel deinterleaving can be expressed by<br>
qm =&gt; pn, for all m and n (however, m and n e {0,1,--,N-1})    	(16)<br>
Embodiments Based on Second Perspective<br>
A description of the bit rearrangement operation according to embodiments of the present invention will be separately made for one case where power is uniformly allocated to the codeword sequence and another case where different power levels are allocated to the front part and the rear part of the codeword sequence. Further, a description of each case will be separately made for 8PSK, 16QAM and 64QAM. In the following description of the bit rearrangement operation, it will be assumed that the number of modulated bits constituting one modulated bit sequence is N, and a codeword sequence before rearrangement, i.e., an output sequence of the channel encoder or a channel interleaver is represented by {x(0),--,x(k),-",x(Nxm-l)}, and a codeword sequence after rearrangement is represented by s0(i),"-,sm.,(i), where ie{0,--,N-1}. Moreover, it will be assumed that the codeword sequence before rearrangement is arranged in the order of the systematic part and the parity part. If the codeword sequence is not arranged in the order of the systematic part and the parity part, straightforward pre-processing is included to arrange the sequence in this order.<br>
C. Power Being Uniformly Allocated to Codeword Sequence When the power is uniformly allocated to the codeword sequence, it is possible to achieve performance improvement in terms of an average packet error<br>

As mentioned before, 2 of 3 bits constituting one 8PSK-modulated bit have higher reliability than the remaining 1 bit. If it is assumed that the signal constellation diagram of FIG. 3 is used, a second bit sl and a third bit s2 have higher reliability than a first bit s0. In this case, an operation of rearranging the output codeword sequence of the channel encoder or the channel interleaver before modulation by the sequence mapper 130 of FIG. 1 is performed as follows.<br>
1.	For the bits in a first period, the sequence mapper 130 sequentially<br>
maps first to {2xN}th bits to positions of a second bit sl and a third bit s2 in each<br>
of N modulated bits.<br>
2.	For the bits in a second period, the sequence mapper 130 sequentially<br>
maps the remaining {2xN+l}th to {3xN}th bits to a position of a first bit s0 in<br>
each of N modulated bits.<br>
These processes are summarized into Equations (17) to (19). The bits of the codeword sequence before rearrangement are rearranged as shown in FIG. 21.<br>
s0(i) - x(2xN+i)    	(17)<br>
s,(i) = x(2xi)    	(18)<br>
s2(i) = x(2xi+l)    	(19)<br>

In step 312, the sequence mapper 130 performs an operation of rearranging the bits of the codeword sequence in the corresponding bit positions of the modulated bit in accordance with Equations (17) to (19).

position s2(i) of the ith modulated bit. The operation of step 312 is repeatedly performed until it is determined in step 313 that the bit mapping has been completely performed on all the bits of the codeword sequence. That is, if it is determined in step 313 that i is less than N, the sequence mapper 130 increases i by 1 in step 314, and then returns to step 312.<br>

FIG. 26 illustrates a procedure for performing a bit rearrangement operation for 64QAM modulation in which power is uniformly allocated to the codeword sequence according to an embodiment of the present invention. This procedure is performed by the sequence mapper 130 of FIG. 1.<br>
Referring to FIG. 26, in step 511, the sequence mapper 130 sets i to zero (i=0). In step 512, the sequence mapper 130 performs an operation of rearranging the bits of the codeword sequence in the corresponding bit positions of the modulated bit in accordance with Equations (24) to (29).

D. Different Power Levels Being Allocated to Front Part and Rear Part of Codeword Sequence<br>
A description of an operation for the case where the power is non-<br>
uniformly allocated to the codeword sequence can be separately made for the following two cases.<br>
In a first case, a higher power level is applied to the front part of the codeword sequence, while a lower power level is applied to the rear part of the codeword sequence. Such power allocation is illustrated in FIG. 7. In this case, the output bits of the channel encoder or the channel interleaver are rearranged in the same method as used when the power is uniformly allocated to the codeword sequence. This is because when the power is unavoidably non-uniformly allocated to the codeword sequence, it is preferable to allocate a higher power level to the systematic part and a lower power level to the parity part in order to secure better performance.<br>
In a second case, to the contrary, a lower power level is applied to the front part of the codeword sequence, while a higher power level is applied to the rear part of the codeword sequence. Such power allocation is illustrated in FIG. 8. In this case, the bit rearrangement method used when the power is uniformly allocated to the codeword sequence is modified because allocating a higher power level to the systematic part shows better performance than allocating a higher power level to the parity part. That is, in order to allocate a higher power level to the systematic part, it is necessary to arrange a specific part of the codeword sequence to the bit positions with the same reliability in an order that is reversed with respect to the order as described in the above cases. An operation of this case will be described with reference to the respective modulation techniques.<br>

Heretofore, the description has been made of the operation of rearranging the output codeword sequence bits of the channel encoder or the channel interleaver before modulation according to the embodiments of the present invention. Next, a description will be made of an operation of arranging output values of a demodulator in the order of the original codeword sequence before channel decoding or channel deinterleaving.<br>
The operation of arranging the output values of the demodulator in the order of the original codeword sequence is achieved by reversly performing the above-described rearranging operation. If an output sequence of the demodulator is represented by {t0(i),"-,tm.,(i)} (where ie{0,-,N-l}) and the sequence arranged in the original order before channel decoding or channel deinterleaving is represented by {yo,-,yic&gt;-,yNxm-i}&gt; tnen a method of arranging output values of the demodulator in the original order before channel decoding or channel deinterleaving can be expressed by shifting the right terms of Equations (17) to (42) to the left terms while substituting 'y' for 'x', and shifting the left terms to the right terms while substituting 't' for 's'. For example, Equation (42) can be changed to y(2xj)=::t5(N-l-i), and used in arranging the output values of the demodulator in the original order.<br>
