Background and prior art of the invention:<br>
Epilepsy is the most common primary neurological disorder known, affecting 0.4-0.8% of the population and up to 50 million people worldwide. It is a collective term given to a ■ group of syndromes that involve spontaneous, intermittent, abnormal electrical activity in the brain, which manifest as seizures.<br><br>
According to Treiman,  D.M. epileptic seizures can be thought' of as paroxysmal, hypcrsynchrdnous, transient electrical discharges in the brain that result from too much '. excitation or too little inhibition in the area, in which the abnormal discharge starts   :-(Treiman, D.M. Epilepsia, 2001, 42 (Suppl. 3), 8-12). The serendipitous discovery of ;' Phenobarbital, in 1912 marked the beginning of the modern pharmacotherapy of epilepsy. In the 70 years that ensued later, Phenytoin, Carbamazepine, Ethosuximide, Sodium. ;-valproate and a range of benzodiazepines became available and can be regarded as "established" antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). In the past decade, nine new agents have been licensed as add-on treatment for difficult-to-control type of epilepsies (Brodie, MJ. and Dichter, M.A.N. N. Engl. J. Med. 1996,334,168). Still more are under evaluation.<br>
A number of experimental and clinical sources provide strong support for a role of GABA in  the  mechanism  and  treatment of epilepsy.  Some  of the   findings  include   1) ■■ abnormalities of GABAergic function in various genetic and acquired animal models of epilepsy (Olsen et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA.  1985, 82, 67,01-6705); 2) GABA :' agonists suppress seizures and GABA antagonists produce seizures; 3) drugs that increase synaptic   GABA   by   inhibiting   GABA   catabolism   or   reuptake,   are   effective !' anticonvulsants (Penry et al. Epilepsia,  1993, 34 (Suppl. 6), 67; Uthman et at. Arch. Neurol. 1998,55,56-62).<br>
Neuropathic pain can be described as pain associated with damage, or permanentL*<br>
alteration of the peripheral or central nervous system by Loughhead et al. in US 6262078 "<br>
Bl. It is a complex disorder resulting from injury to the nerve or to certain areas of the<br>
spinal cord or brain. In contrast to acute nociceptive pain (which! usually persists only.'<br>
while the injury is present), the cascade of events, that arise following peripheral nerve<br>
injury leads to a maintained abnormality in the sensory system, resulting in an abnormal -■<br>
pain phenomenon that can be grossly debilitating.	ri<br>
Neuropathic pain is commonly associated with several distinct characteristics. First, there ( are often abnormal or unfamiliar, unpleasant sensations, called dysesthesias, that include shooting, lacerating or burning pain, which occurs in the absence of ongoing tissues damage. Second, stimuli that are normally non painful often cause pain, a condition called<br>
3<br><br>
allodynia. Finally, neuropathic pain is characterized by hyperalgesia, a condition where the pain message from a normally noxious event is exacerbated, so that a much greater intensity of pain is felt (Munro et al. Trends in Pharmacol. Sci. 2003. 24, 555-557).<br>
At present, there are very few effective and well tolerated therapies for neuropathic pain. . The development of animal models and constant progress in understanding the basic pathophysiology of neuropathic pain has led to the introduction of adjuvant analgesics, such as AEDs (Laughlin et al. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2002, 302, .1168-1175). Most of these agents are use-dependent inhibitors of Na+ channels. Some of the clinically used drugs include Phenytoin, Lamotrigine and Carbamazepine.<br>
According to Rani et al., increase in the 5-HT level affects the pain modulating system in the brain. Hence, apart from the conventionally used antidepressants, a growing interest in the use of selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), for the treatment of various pain syndromes is now seen (Rani et al. Anesih. Analg. 1996, 83, 371-375). Modulation of Ca:+ channels is another useful approach for the treatment of neuropathic pain. In particular, the modulation of N-type Ca2+ channels, which are expressed primarily in central and peripheral nervous tissues, has been the subject of greatest interest (Hu et al. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 1999, 9, 2151-2156).<br>
As a result of the above-mentioned pharmacological findings, world-wide research has:' focused on the development of derivatives of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA. Various GABA derivatives have been published in the patent and non-patent literature.<br>
■P<br>
One of the pioneering efforts in the area of research on GABA analogues was the discovery that baclofen, a GABA analogue could be considered a prototype for GABAB receptor agonists. Baclofen was first synthesized in 1962, by the CIBA chemist Heinrich Keberle and was shown to exert potent muscle-relaxant and analgesic properties (Froestl et al. IL Farmaco, 2003, 58, 173-183). A report from Bowery et al. (Pharmacol. Rev., 54, 247-264, 2002) holds baclofen as an invaluable pharmacological tool in elucidating the role of GABAB receptors in several disorders including epilepsy, cognition, pain, and addiction. Other GABA analogs reported to have anticonvulsant activities include, cyclic amino acids such as Nipecotic acid, Guvacine, and homo-P-proline (Nielsen et al. J. Med. Chem. 1990, 33, 71-77). Gabapentin and Pregabalin are the recent marketed drugs having<br>
4<br><br>
anticonvulsant, anxiolytic-like and analgesic actions (Bryans et al. Med. Res. Rev. 1999, 19, 149-177).<br>
Gabapentin, which was developed earlier for the treatment of partial seizures, was also found to be active in the treatment of postherpetic neuralgia (a type of neuropathic pain) and in several preclinical models of neuropathic pain (Field et al. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1997, 121, 1513-1522). Pregabalin have shown promising antiepileptic and antinociceptive effects in various animal models of neuropathic pain in preclinical studies (Taylor et al. Epilepsy Res. 1993, 14, 11-15; Field et al. Br .J. Pharmacol. 1997, 121, 1513-1522) and has been approved for the treatment of various neuropathic pain conditions.<br>
A Spiro compound is a bicyclic organic compound with rings connected through just one atom. The rings can be different in nature or identical, the connecting atom is also called as the Spiro atom, most often a quaternary carbon (Spiro carbon). A number of Spiro compounds were found to have good CNS activity. It was envisaged that these privileged structures could be valuable alternative in the search for new receptor ligands.<br>
Structural analogues of Spiro[l,3-dioxane-2,3'-indolin]-2'-one, Spirb[l,3-dithiolane-2,3'-indolin]-2'-one, Spiro[indoline-3,2'-[ 1,3]- oxathiolan]-2-one, and 3,3-dimethoxyindolin-2-one were found to have good anticonvulsant activity (J. Med. Chem. 1988, 31, 1001-1005).<br>
r<br>
Spirocyclopropyl agents were found to have anticonvulsant activity, when tested against<br>
pentylenetetrazole-induced seizures in mice. These agents effectively displaced j5[S]-tert-butylbicyclophosphorothionate (3S[S]-TBPS), a ligand for the picrotoxin binding site of the GABAA/chloride channel, from rat neuronal membranes and 'affected the GABA-mediated current in hippocampal neurons {J. Med. Chem. 1994, 37, 275-286).<br>
A series of Spiro analogues of Gabapentin, in which the GABA portion was subjected to conformational constraints, was synthesized in order to investigate the preferred binding conformation of the GABA moiety of Gabapentin. Conformktionally constrained analogues and Gabapentin had similar in vitro and in vivo biological activities at the Gabapentin binding site and in the carrageenan-induced thermal hyperalgesia model<br><br>
respectively. These results suggest that the GABA portion of Gabapentiri may adopt a<br>
binding conformation (Receveur et al. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 1999, 9, 2329 - 2324).<br>
i<br>
2-Alkylamino-substituted-l,4-benzoxazinederivatives, a new class of potential<br>
neuroprotective agents were synthesized and examined for their intrinsic cytotoxicity and<br>
their capacity to inhibit oxidative stress-mediated neuronal degeneration in vitro 3,3-<br>
diphenyl-substituted-1,4-benzoxazinederivative, was found |to have potent<br>
neuroprotective activity without the manifestation of intrinsic cytotoxicity (J. Med. Chem.<br>
2005,48, 1282-1286).	[<br>
Various GABA derivatives have been described earlier for the treatment of epilepsy and neuropathic pain. For example, Patent No(s). US 6833140 B2 (Cundy et al.) and US 6525096 Bl (Silverman et al.) disclose various optionally substituted derivatives of GABA, useful as agents for the treatment of epilepsy.<br>
r<br>
Baclofen, which could be considered as a prototype for GABAB receptor agonists, was shown to exert potent muscle-relaxant, analgesic and anticonvulsant properties (Froestl et al. IL Farmaco, 2003, 58, 173-183). Conformationally-restricted GABA analogs such as Nipecotic acid, Guvacine, and homo-Ji-proline were shown to have in vitro activity as inhibitors of [3H]-GABA uptake (Nielsen et al. J. Med Chem. 1990,-33, 71-77). In 1999, Bryans et ai. reported Gabapentin and Pregabalin as having anticonvulsant, anxiolytic-like, and analgesic actions (Bryans et al. Med. Res. Rev. 1999, 19, 149-177). These two molecules are currently being used for the treatment of neuropathic pain.<br>
US6642398 B2 (Belliotti et al., 2003) discloses a method, wherein the synthesis of mono and disubstituted 3-propyl y-aminobutyric acids was disclosed. In addition to the reported anticonvulsant activity, the compounds were proposed as effective in the treatment of hypokinesia,   cranial   disorders,   neurodegenerative   disorders,   depression,   anxiety,<br>
L<br>
neuropathological disorders, arthritis, sleep disorders, and gastric damage. In the same year, Belliotti et al. in their another patent US6627771 Bl patented another series of compounds, which are cycloalkyl derivatives of GABA and proved them as having improved activity in models of pain and epilepsy. The DBA/2 mouSe model was<br>
employed to test the protection offered by the compounds against sound-induced seizures.<br>
i<br><br>
The Spiro functionality has been known for a long time to be present in phytochemicals<br>
either in alkaloids, lactones or terpenoids. The Spirocyclic alkaloid (K)-histrionicotoxin<br>
isolated from skin extracts of the poison dart frog Dendrobais histrionius found in<br>
Columbia, is a very potent nicotinic receptor antagonist (Daly et al. Proc. Nail. Acad. Sci.<br>
U.S.A.I971, 68, 1870). The Spiro [pyrrolidin-3,30-indole] ring system is a recurring<br>
stnicturat motif in a number of natural products such as vinblastine and vincristine, that<br>
function as cytostatics and are of prime importance in cancer chemotherapy (cordell et al.<br>
The Alkaloids: Chemistry and Biology; Academic: San Diego, 1998; Vol. 5). Some<br>
Spiroheterocycles benzopyrans, which are aldose reductase inhibitors found to be useful<br>
as antidiabetics (Eggler et al. Chem. Absir. 1992, 116, 59214q). Several potent reductase<br>
inhibitors based on Spirosuccinimide, Spiropyridazine and Spiroazetidine have been<br>
reported for the prevention of secondary complications of diabetes (Malamas et al. J.<br>
Med. Chem. 1994,37,2059).	:.<br>
US4181728 by Sarges et al. discloses Spiro-polycyclimidazolidinedione derivatives<br>
(2,,3,-dihydro-spiro[imidazolidine-4,4'-[4H]-Naptho[l,2-bJpyran]-2,5-dione,	2\3'-<br>

Pharmacological screening<br>
The compounds of formula I have been found to possess valuable pharmacological properties. They have been shown to be useful as anticonvulsants, after screening in the standard in vivo animal models of seizure. The tests used were the Maximal Electroshock Seizure (MES) threshold test and the subcutaneous Pentylenetetrazole-induced seizure threshold test (scPTZ) (Swinyard et al. FedProc. 1985, 44, 2629-2633).<br>
In particular, the compounds of formula I have also been shown to possess good activity in various experimental animal models of physiological and neuropathic pain. The models include, Acetic acid induced writhing model, Formalin induced flinching model, Chronic<br>
17<br><br>
Constriction Injury (CCl) model, Spinal Nerve Ligation (SNL) model, Infra Orbital Nerve Ligation model (ION) and Diabetic Neuropathy (DNP) model.<br>
In physiological pain models, pain was induced by using chemicals like acetic acid and formalin (Quinn H. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine, 2002, 385-401; Steiner Hunskaar Pain, 30, 1987, 103-114 ). Diabetic Neuropathy was induced using intra¬peritoneal injection of Streptozotocin (Field el al, 1998, Pain, 80 1999, 391-398). Neuropathic surgery was done as previously described (Kim and Chung, Pain, 1992, 50, 355-363; Choi et al. Pain, 1994, 59, 369-376; Imamura et al. Brain Research, 1997, 116, 97-103). Behavioral signs of different components of neuropathic pain were measured as previously described in detail (Choi et al. Pain, 1994, 59, 369-376): spontaneous pain, dynamic allodynia, cold allodynia, and mechanical hyperalgesia.<br>
In-vivo Assays:<br>
The assays determine the effectiveness of compounds of formula I in relieving one of the symptoms of physiological and neuropathic pain in in-vivo models.<br>
In Acetic acid induced pain, intra-peritoneal injection of 3% acetic acid was given to mice (n=6), resulting in characteristic behaviors like hunching the back, licking the abdomen, tilting the pelvis, stretching, rubbing the abdomen against the floor etc. The numbers of responses were monitored for 30 minutes.<br>
In formalin test (n=6), the injection of a 1% formalin (0.025 ml) was given into subcutaneous tissues, typically the dorsal surface of the rodent paw, that gives flinches of paw in the early phase (0-5 min) and the late phase (10-30 min). Total time lifting, licking and biting were monitored.<br>
In rat model of diabetic neuropathy (n=4), 50 mg/kg of Streptozotocin was given to induced neuropathy and behavioral tests like heat hyperalgesia, cold allodynia and radiant heat induced tail flicking were performed from 9Ih day onwards.<br>
For neuropathic surgery models (CCl, SNL and ION), rats of 150-200g were taken and a total number of four rats (n=4) were assigned to each group. Briefly, the rats were<br>
18<br><br>
anesthetized with an intra-peritoneal dose of pentobarbital sodium (65 mg/kg) with additional doses of anesthetic given as needed.<br>
In the CCI (Chronic Constriction Injury) model, a 3 cm incision was made on the lateral aspect of the left hindlimb (ipsilateral) at the mid-thigh level, with the right hindlimb serving as the control (contralateral). The left paraspinal muscles were then separated from the spinous processes and the left sciatic nerve was exposed just above the trifurcation point. Four loose ligatures were then made with a 4-0 silk thread along the sciatic nerve each with a 1-2 mm spacing in between. The wound was then closed by suturing the muscle using catgut with a continuous suture pattern. Finally, the skin was sutured using silk thread with horizontal-mattress suture pattern. The animal was then transferred to its home-cage and left for recovery.<br>
In the SNL (Spinal Nerve Ligation) model, the L5 spinal nerve was exposed at the level of the dorsal root ganglion, and ligated tightly with a 4-0 silk thread. Only one tight ligature was made in this model.<br>
ION (Infra Orbital Nerve) model, which mimics the human secondary trigeminal neuralgia, was performed by making an incision of approximately 1 cm, along the gingivobuccal margin and exposing infra orbital nerve (ION) branch of the trigeminal nerve. Two loose ligations of infra orbital nerve branch leading to chronic constriction injury were made using 4-0 chromic gut suture. Hemostasis was confirmed and the wound was closed. In all these models a sham-operated group was maintained wherein the nerve was exposed, but no manipulation was made on the nerve. The rats demonstrating unilateral mononeuropathy were assessed for allodynia and hyperalgesia sensitivity. Behavioral tests were performed both on the 9* and the 14th day post-surgery.<br>

The compounds of formula I were tested at various doses, ranging from ] to 300 mg/kg through intraperitoneal route. Control rats received a solution of physiological saline, through the same route (Positive control). In neuropathic surgery models, ongoing spontaneous pain was quantified by measuring the duration of paw-withdrawal under unprovoked conditions. Tactile or Dynamic allodynia was measured by noting the latency to paw-withdrawal after an innocuous stimulus e.g. stroking with a cotton-bud. Cold-allodynia was measured using the acetone-drop test, by squirting acetone in few drops and noting the duration of paw-withdrawal. Finally, in the mechanical hyperalgesia test, hindpaw withdrawal duration was measured after a mild pin-prick to the plantar-surface of the ligated and normal hindpaws.<br>
Example 4<br>
Preliminary anticonvulsant screens were undertaken to test compounds of formula I, whether or not they increase the seizure threshold and prevent seizure spread. Firstly, in the MES (Maximal Eiectroshock Seizure) test, maximal seizures were elicited by a 60Hz alternating current of 50mA intensity, delivered for 0.2s via corneal electrodes. Test solutions of all compounds were prepared in 0.5% methyl cellulose and the animals were dosed intra-peritoneally 30min prior to testing. Abolition of the hindlimb tonic extensor component of the seizure was defined as protection in the MES test.<br>
Secondly, in the subcutaneous Pentylenetetrazol (scPTZ) tests, pentylenetetrazole was administered subcutaneously at a dose of 85mg/kg to mice. Test solutions of all compounds were prepared in 0.5% methyl cellulose and the animals were dosed intra-peritoneally 30 min prior to testing. Absence of a single 5s episode of clonic spasm was taken as the end-point of this test.<br>
Thirdly, in the neurotoxicity screen, the mice were trained to stay on an accelerating rotarod, which rotates at 6 rpm. Trained animals were given i.p.(intra-peritoneal) injections of the test compounds. Neurotoxicity was indicated by the inability of the animal to maintain equilibrium on the rod for at least 1 minute in each of the three trials.<br>
30<br><br>
Compounds of the present invention showed protection in the MES and scPTZ model at a dose ranging from 100 to 300mg/kg.<br>
Example 5<br>
Picrotoxin and strychnine-induced seizure tests (ipPIC tests and scSTY) were undertaken to understand the mechanisms of action of the prepared compounds. Briefly, picrotoxin, a GABAA antagonist was injected intra-peritoneally at a dose level of 4mg/kg to a group of swiss albino mice. The control group mice received the vehicle (30% PEG 400), while the test group mice were pre-treated with compounds of formula I, 30 minutes prior to picrotoxin administration. The animals were observed for a period of 90 minutes after picrotoxin injection, during which the number of seizures, the duration of seizures and the time of onset of seizures were noted down.<br>
Compounds of the present invention showed protection against picrotoxin-induced seizures till 4 hours, at a dose range of 10 to 300mg/kg.<br>
In the strychnine-induced seizure pattern test, strychnine, a glycine receptor antagonist was injected subcutaneously at a dose of 1.2mg/kg. The control group mice received the vehicle (30% PEG 400), while the test group mice were pre-treated with compounds of formula I, 30 minutes prior to strychnine administration. The animals were observed for a period of 90 minutes after strychnine injection during which the number of seizures, the duration of seizures and the time of onset of seizures were noted down. Also prevention of mortality was taken as an important effect of the compounds.<br>
Compounds of the present invention showed protection against strychnine-induced<br>
seizures till 4 hours, at a doses ranging from 10 to 300mg/kg.<br>
Example 6<br>
Acetic acid and Formalin Assays:<br>
Acetic acid and Formalin tests were used as preliminary tests for antinociceptive evaluation of compounds of formula 1. In acetic acid test, writhing was induced by an intra-peritoneal injection of 0.1 ml of 3% v/v acetic acid in mice (n=6). The test<br>
31<br><br>
compounds were suspended in 30% v/v PEG 400 and administered intra-peritoneally half an hour prior to acetic acid administration. The control group mice received normal saline (0.01 ml/g). The numbers of writhings occurring for a 30 min time period immediately after acetic acid injection were recorded. The percentage inhibition of the writhing response was calculated. The compounds of the present invention produced a significant inhibition in writhing behavior at the dose of 100 mg/kg..<br>
In formalin test, an injection of a small amount of formalin was injected into the subcutaneous tissue, typically the dorsal surface of the rodent paw that gives flinches of paw in the early phase (0-5 min) and the late phase (30-40 min). Total time of lifting, licking and biting paw was monitored.<br>
The results showed that intra-peritoneal administration of the compounds of formula I had a significant effect in reducing flinching behaviors in both the phases at the dose of lOOmg/kg.<br>
Example 7<br>
Spontaneous Pain In-vivo Assay:<br>
This assay determines the effectiveness of compounds of formula I in relieving one of the symptoms in an in vivo model of neuropathic pain, produced by Infra Orbital Nerve (ION) ligation, namely spontaneous pain.<br>
Spontaneous pain was induced in rats using the procedures described by Imamura et al. Brain Research, 1997, 116, 97-103. Briefly, the rats were anesthetized with an intra¬peritoneal dose of pentobarbital sodium (65 mg/kg) with additional doses of anesthetic given, as needed. An incision approximately 1 cm long was made along the gingivobuccal margin. The incision would begin just proximal to the first molar. About 0.5 cm of the infra orbital nerve (ION) branch of the trigeminal nerve was freed of adhering tissue, and two ligatures (4-0 chromic gut) were tied loosely around it. The incision was sutured at three points using 4-0 silk; the animal was transferred to its home-cage and left for recovery. The sham operation was identical except that, the nerve was not ligated.<br>
32<br><br>
Spontaneous pain was assessed for a total time period of 7 minutes. The operated rat was placed inside an observation cage. An initial acclimatization period of 3 minutes was given to each of the rats. A total number of four rats (n=4) were assigned to this group. A positive spontaneous pain response consisted of spontaneous grooming of face for a finite period of time. The duration of spontaneous grooming was then noted down. The pre-dose screening values were used as the animal's baseline spontaneous pain scores.<br>
The results show that at i.p. administration the compounds of formula I had a palliating effect on the pain response in the dose 100 mg/kg. Overall the compounds of the present invention were found to be effective in reversing spontaneous pain-like symptoms, when tested by this method.<br>
Example 8<br>
Dynamic Allodynia In-vivo Assay:<br>
This assay determines the effectiveness of compounds of formula I in relieving one of the symptoms of neuropathic pain produced by spinal nerve ligation (SNL), namely dynamic allodynia, in an in vivo model.<br>
Dynamic allodynia was induced in rats, using the procedures described by Kim and Chung, Pain, 1992, 50, 355-363. Briefly, the rats were anesthetized with an intra¬peritoneal dose of pentobarbital sodium (65 mg/kg) with additional doses of anesthetic given, as needed. A 3-cm incision was made on the lateral aspect of the left hindlimb (ipsilateral) at the mid-thigh level, with the right hindlimb serving as the control (contralateral). The L5 spinal nerve was then exposed at the level of the dorsal root ganglion, and ligated tightly with a 4-0 silk thread. Only one tight ligature was made in this model. After confirmation of hemostasis, the wound was then closed by suturing the muscle using catgut with a continuous suture pattern. Finally, the skin was sutured using silk thread with horizontal-mattress suture pattern. The animal was then transferred to its home-cage and left for recovery.<br>
33<br><br>
All of the operated rats were assessed for dynamic allodynic response. The operated rat was placed inside an observation cage that was kept 5 cm from the ground level. An initial acclimatization period of 3 minutes was given to each of the rats. A total number of four rats (n=4) were assigned to this group. A positive dynamic allodynic response consisted of lifting the affected paw for a finite period of time, in response to mild stroking on the plantar region using a cotton-bud. This stimulus is non-noxious to a normal-behaving rat. The latency to paw-withdrawal was then noted down. A cut-off time of 15s was taken for a normal paw response. The pre-dose screening values were used as the animal's baseline dynamic allodynia scores.<br>
The results show that at i.p. administration, the compounds of formula I had a palliating effect on the pain response in the dose range of 1 -100 mg/kg.<br>
Example 9<br>
Cold Allodynia In-vivo Assay:<br>
This assay determines the effectiveness of compounds of formula I in relieving one of the symptoms of neuropathic pain, produced by the Chronic Constriction Injury (CCl) to the common sciatic nerve, namely cold allodynia, in an in vivo model.<br>
Unilateral mononeuropathy was produced in rats, using the Chronic Constriction Injury (CCl) model, performed essentially as described by Bennet and Xie, Pain, 1988, 33, 87-107. Briefly, the rats were anesthetized with an intra-peritoneal dose of pentobarbital sodium (65 mg/kg) with additional doses of anesthetic given, as needed. A 3-cm incision was made on the lateral aspect of the left hindlimb (ipsilateral) at the mid-thigh level with the right hindlimb serving as the control (contralateral). The left paraspinal muscles were then separated from the spinous processes and the left sciatic nerve was exposed just above the trifurcation point. Four loose ligatures were then made with a 4-0 silk thread along the sciatic nerve each with a 1-2 mm spacing in between. The wound was then closed by suturing the muscle using catgut with a continuous suture pattern. Finally, the skin was sutured using silk thread with horizontal-mattress suture pattern. The animal was then transferred to Us home-cage and left for recovery.<br>
34<br><br>
The rats demonstrating unilateral mononeuropathy were assessed for acute cold allodynia sensitivity. The operated rat was placed inside an observation cage that was kept 5 cm from the ground level. An initial acclimatization period of 3 minutes was given to each of the rats. A total number of four rats (n=4) were assigned to this group. The test used was the acetone-spray test. Few drops of freshly dispensed acetone were sprayed as a fine mist onto the plantar region of the affected paw. A cold allodynic response was assessed by noting down the duration of paw-withdrawal. The pre-dose screening values were used as the animal's baseline cold allodynia scores.<br>
When tested in the acute cold-allodynia assay the compounds of formula I generally demonstrated anti-allodynic effects in the dose range of 1 -100 mg/kg.<br>
Example 10<br>
Mechanical Hyperalgesia In-vivo Assay:<br>
This assay determines the effectiveness of compounds of formula I in relieving one of the symptoms in an in vivo model of neuropathic pain produced by unilateral mononeuropathy, namely mechanical hyperalgesia.<br>
A chronic constriction injury was produced by loosely ligating the left common sciatic nerve as described by Bennet and Xie, Pain, 1988, 33, 87-107. The right common sciatic nerve was visualized, but not manipulated to produce sham conditions.<br>
The rats demonstrating unilateral mononeuropathy were assessed for mechanical hyperalgesia sensitivity. The operated rat was placed inside an observation cage that was kept 5 cm from the ground level. An initial acclimatization period of 3 minutes was given to each of the rats. A total number of four rats (n=4) were assigned to this group. Hindpaw withdrawal duration was measured after a mild pin prick to the plantar surface of the ligated (left) and sham (right) hindpaws.<br>
The compounds of the present invention produced a long-lasting (3 hours) reversal of mechanical hyperalgesia, elicited by a pin-prick stimulus in rats with a chronic constriction injury when tested by this method in a dose range of 1 to 100 mg/kg.<br>
35'<br><br>
Example 11<br>
Diabetic Neuropathy:<br>
Diabetes was induced by a single intra-peritoneal injection of Streptozocin (50 mg/kg) in rats {Field et ai, 1998, Pain, 80 1999, 391-398. Control animals received a similar administration of isotonic saline. Diabetes was confirmed one week later by measurement of tail vein blood glucose levels with a suitable glucometer. Nociceptive behavioral assessment was undertaken from 9* day onwards. Tail flick (radiant heat) test which is a pain receptive assay was performed. The rat was placed within a restraining tube with its tail protruding. The tail was placed on a level surface, a radiant heat was applied to the tail and the latency of the rat to remove its tail from the heat was recorded.<br>
The results showed that intra-peritoneal administration of the compounds of formula I increased the flicking latency and had a palliating effect on the pain response at the dose of lOOmg/kg<br>
