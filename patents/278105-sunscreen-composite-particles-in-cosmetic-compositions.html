COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
(See Section 10 and Rule 13)<br>
SUNSCREEN COMPOSITE PARTICLE IN COSMETIC COMPOSITION<br>
HINDUSTAN UNILEVER LIMITED, a company incorporated under<br>
the Indian Companies Act, 1913 and having its registered office<br>
at 165/166, Backbay Reclamation, Mumbai -400 020, Maharashtra, India<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed<br>
 <br>
SUNSCREEN COMPOSITE PARTICLES IN COSMETIC COMPOSITIONS<br>
The invention concerns cosnnetic sunscreen compositions delivering UV protection and also soft focus properties.<br>
Ultraviolet radiation can be damaging to skin. Imnnediate damage may be in the form of erythema. More long term is the concern of initiating cancerous growth. For these reasons, photo protective agents known as sunscreens have been incorporated into cosmetic products.<br>
Facial cosmetics desirably deliver not only photoprotection but also function to enhance overall skin appearance. Most persons have facial imperfections. These may include uneven tone, enlarged pores, fine lines and wrinkles,<br>
Soft focus is a technique which can hide imperfect skin. Incoming light is distorted by scattering (lensing). Particulate components of the cosmetic operate as lenses to bend and twist light into a variety of directions.<br>
US 5 997 890 (Sine et al.), US 5 972 359 (Sine et al.), and US 6 174 533 B1 (SaNogueira, Jr.) are all directed to topical compositions to provide good coverage of skin imperfections. The solution proposed by these documents is the use of a metal oxide with a refractive index of at least 2 and a neat primary particle size of from 100 to 300 nm. Preferred particulates are titanium dioxide, zirconium oxide and zinc oxide.<br>
US 2005/0163813 Al (Kosbach et al.) reports use of fumed alumina particles for enhancing the soft-focus effect of certain cosmetic compositions.<br>
Crosslinked silicone elastomers also have been identified as aids in achieving soft focus. US 2005/0163730 Al (Rosevear et al.) discloses a synergistic interaction between crosslinked silicone elastomer and zinc oxide having average particle size less than 300 nm. A related disclosure is found in US 2005/0249684 Al (Dobkowski et al.) wherein a taurate polymer enhances optical effects in combination with a silicone elastomer and zinc oxide.<br>
 <br>
A disadvantage of silicone elastomers is their interaction with organic sunscreens. Generally the silicone elastomers are suspended/dissolved in a silicone fluid carrier. These silicone fluid carriers are extractable into the organic sunscreens thereby shriveling the elastomer particles adversely affecting soft focus properties. Consequently, there is a 5 challenge to provide a soft focus effect while maintaining a relatively high degree of photo protective properties in a cosmetic composition.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
A cosmetic composition is provided which includes:<br>
10      (i)     from 0.1 to 20% by weight of hydrophilic composite particles formed of an organic sunscreen agent and a binder in a relative weight ratio of 5:1 to 1:10; (ii)     from 0.1 to 30% by weight of particles of a crosslinked silicone elastomer; and (iii)    a cosmetically acceptable carrier.<br>
15      DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Now it has been found that the soft focus effect imparted through particles of a crosslinked silicone elastomer can be retained in a sunscreen composition having a high sunscreen protective factor (SPF). Photo protection is accomplished through hydrophilic composite particles formed of a binder and an organic sunscreen agent<br>
20<br>
Hydrophilic Composite Particles of Sunscreen Agent<br>
Composite particles of the present invention will have a hydrophilic outer surface. Hydrophilicity may be achieved through use of a hydrophilic binder or via a hydrophilic coating such as a silica or alumina coating.  The binder may be hydrophilic or<br>
25 hydrophobic. Suitable categories of binder are polymers such as polyacrylates, polyvinylpyrrolidones, polyesters, polyamides, polyethers, polyolefins, polysaccharides including cellulose derivatives, starches, clays, hydrocarbons and combinations thereof. Sunscreen agents can either be dispersed throughout the binder or can be formed as a core surrounded by binder.<br>
30<br>
Relative weight ratio of organic sunscreen agent to binder may range from 5:1 to 1:10, preferably from 3:1 to 1:8, more preferably from 2:1 to 1:7, optimally from 1:1 to 1:3. Amounts of the binder may range from 10% to 99.5% by weight of the hydrophilic<br>
 <br>
composite particles. More preferably weight of the binder may range from 30% to 98%, optimally from 50 to 85% by weight of the hydrophiiic composite particles. Amounts of the sunscreen agent may range from 0.5 to 90%, preferably from 2 to 70%, optimally from 30 to 50% by weight of the hydrophiiic composite particles. 5<br>
Amounts of the hydrophiiic composite particles within the cosmetic emulsion composition may range from 0.1 to 30%, preferably from 2 to 15%, optimally from 4 to 10% by weight of the cosmetic composition.<br>
10     Average particle size of the hydrophiiic particles may range from 10 to 2,000 nm, preferably from 100 to 1,500 nm, and optimally from 200 to 1000 nm.<br>
Sunscreen agents according to this invention will have at least one chromophoric group absorbing within the ultraviolet ranging from 290 to 400 nm.   Chromophoric organic<br>
15 sunscreen agents may be divided into the following categories (with specific examples) including: p-aminobenzoic add, its salts and its derivatives (ethyl, isobutyl, glyceryl esters; p-dimethylaminobenzoic acid); anthranilates (o-aminobenzoates; methyl, menthyl, phenyl, benzyl, phenylethyl, linalyl, terpinyl, and cyclohexenyl esters); salicylates (octyl, amyl, phenyl, benzyl, menthyl, glyceryl and dipropyleneglycol esters); cinnamic add derivatives<br>

25 naphthol-3,6-disulfonIc and of 2-naphthol-5,8-disulfonic acids); dihydroxy-naphthoic acid and its salts; o- and p-Hydroxybiphenyldisulfonates; coumarin derivatives (7-hydroxy, 7-methyl and 3-phenyl); diazoles (2-acetyl-3-bromoindazole, phenyl benzoxazole, methyl naphthoxazole and various aryl benzothiazoles); quinine salts (bisulfate, sulfate, chloride, oieate and tannate); quinoline    derivatives    (8-hydroxyquinoline    salts    and    2-<br>
30 phenylquinoline); hydroxy- or methoxy-substituted benzophenones; uric and vilouric acids;<br>
tannic add and its derivatives (e.g. hexaethylether); (butyl carbityl) (6-propyl piperonyl)<br>
ether; hydroquinone; benzophenones (oxybenzone, sulisobenzone, dioxybenzone,<br>
benzoresorcinol, 2,2',4,4'-tetrahydroxybenzophenone,	2,2'-dihydroxy-4,4'-<br>
 <br>
dimethoxybenzophenone        and        octabenzone);	4-isopropyldibenzoylmethane;<br>
butylmethoxydibenzoylmethane; etocrylene; and 4-isopropyl-di benzoyl methane).<br>
Particularly useful sunscreen agents are: 2-ethylhexyl p-methoxycinnamate, 4,4'-t-butyl 5 methoxydibenzoylmethane, 2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzophenone (known also as Benzophenone-3), octyldimethyl p-aminobenzoic acid, digalloyltrioieate, 2,2-dihydroxy-4-methoxybenzophenone, ethyl 4-[b(s(hydroxypropyl)]aminobenzoate, 2-ethylhexy!-2-cyano-3,3-diphenylacrylate, 2-ethylhexylsaIicylate, glyceryl p-aminobenzoate, 3,3,5-trtmethylcyclohexylsalicylate, methylanthranilate, p-dtmethyiaminobenzoic acid or<br>
10 aminobenzoate, 2-ethylhexyl p-dimethylaminobenzoate, 2-phenylbenzinnidazole-5-sulfonic acid, 2-{p-dimethylaminophenyl)-5-su[foniobenzoxazoic acid, 4-methylbenzylidene camphor, bis-ethylhexyloxyphenol methoxyphenol triazine, methylene bis-benzotriazolyl tetramethylbutylphenol, dimethicodiethylbenzal malonate, isoamyl methoxycinnamate, octyl triazone, terephthalidene dicamphor sulfonic acid and mixtures<br>
15      thereof.<br>
Cosmetic compositions of this invention may not only have sunscreen agent held within but an amount of sunscreen agent may be formulated free of binder within the composition. When present outside the composite, the sunscreen agent may be available<br>
20 in amounts from 0.1 to 25%, particularly from 2 to 15% by weight of the composition. Some preferred embodiments of this invention may be formulated without any sunscreen agent external to the composite particles or with only a relatively small amount external to the composite particles. For instance, the external sunscreen agent may range in amount from 0 to 5%, preferably from 0.01 to 2%, and possibly from 0.01 to 0.8% by<br>
25      weight of the composition.<br>
A number of hydrophllic composite particles with sunscreen agent are commercially available. A first commercial material is known as "Sun Caps" sold by Particle Science Inc. of Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. Average particle size is reported to be approximately 250 30 nm. Sun Caps 664 is sold with a concentration of octylmethoxycinnamate (OMC) of 21.5% encapsulated in a binder that includes beeswax, carnauba wax, vinyl pyrrolidone/eicosene copolymer and emulsifiers (PEG-100 stearate, PEG-20, bis-PEG-12 dimethicone, sorbitan tristearate and Steareth-100).  Sun Caps™ are formed in a process<br>
 <br>
revealed in US 5 733 531 herein incorporated by reference. The encapsulates are supplied as an aqueous dispersion containing up to 65% solids.<br>
Another hydrophilic composite particulate commercially available is sold by Rona Division 5 of EMD Chemicals under the trademark Eusolex® UV-Pearls™ OMC. UV Pearls are prepared and described in US 7 264 795 herein incorporated by reference. These composites are delivered as 40% particles delivered in 60% aqueous carrier. The particles are structured with a core of greater than 70% octylmethoxycinnamate surrounded by a coating of 10% silica, 1-2% polyvinylpyrrolidone (as binder), and minor ingredients. 10<br>
Another useful hydrophilic composite particulate according to the present invention<br>
utilizes a binder which is a condensation polymerized polyamide resin, and especially an<br>
ester-terminated polyamide resin.  A preferred embodiment of this binder is a<br>
polyalkyleneoxypolyamide (referred to as an PAOPA resin) and also an ester-terminated<br>
15      poly(ester-amide) (referred to as an EPTEA resin). The PAOPA resin can be prepared by<br>
reacting a monocarboxylic acid, a diamine compound, and a diacid. The EPTEA resin can<br>
be prepared by reacting a dibasic acid, a diamine, a polyol and a mono alcohol.<br>
Preferably the EPTEA resin may be formed from reaction of: (a) at least 50 equivalent<br>
percent of the dibasic acid comprises polymerized fatty acid; (b) at least 50 equivalent<br>
20      percent of the diamine comprises ethylene diamine; (c) 10-60 equivalent percent of the<br>
total of the hydroxyl and amine equivalents   provided   by   diamine,   polyol   and<br>
monoalcohol are provided by monoalcohol; and (d) no more than 50 equivalent percent<br>
of the total of the hydroxyl and amine equivalents provided by diamine, polyol and<br>
monoalcohol are provided by polyol. Preparation and description of these resins is found<br>
25      in US 7 329 719 B2 and US 6 492 458 herein incorporated by reference.  Particularly<br>
preferred are resins under the commercial trademark Sylvaclear PA 1200V, identified by<br>
INCI nameof Polyamide-3, and Sylvaclear AF 1900V sold by Arizona Chemical Company,<br>
Jacksonville, Florida.    These resins are easily intimately mixed with OMC to form a<br>
composite particulate with photoprotective sunscreen.<br>
30<br>
Hydrophilic composite particulates which utilize as binder a condensation polymerized polyamide resin can generally be prepared as follows. A vessel is charged with the resin and the organic sunscreen agent.   These are heated up to 85-90°C and mixed until<br>
 <br>
homogenous. The resultant homogeneous organic melt is then slowly poured with mixing into a second vessel containing heated water. Particles of the organic melt then congeal into particulates forming the composite resin/sunscreen.  These part!cu\a1:es can be easily separated as insolubles from the water. 5<br>
Crosslinked Silicone Elastomer<br>
A component of the present invention is a crosslinked silicone (organopolysiloxane) elastomer. No specific restriction exists as to the type of curable organopolysiloxane that can serve as starting material for the crosslinked silicone elastomer.  Examples in this<br>
10 respect are addition reaction-curing organopolysiloxane which cure under platinum metal catalysis by the addition reaction between SiH-containing diorganopolysiloxane and organopolysiloxane having silicon-bonded vinyl groups; condensation-curing organopolysiloxane which cure in the presence of an organotin compound by a dehydrogenation reaction between hydroxyl terminated diorganopolysiloxane and SiH-<br>
15 containing diorganopolysiloxane; condensation-curing organopolysiloxane which cure in the presence of an organotin compound or a titanate ester, by a condensation reaction between a hydroxyl terminated diorganopolysiloxane and a hydrolyzabie organosilane (this condensation reaction is exemplified by dehydration, alcohol-liberating, oxime-liberating, amine-Iiberating, amide-liberating, carboxyl-liberating, and ketone-liberating<br>
20 reactions); peroxide-curing organopolysiloxane which thermally cure in the presence of an organoperoxide catalyst; and organopolysiloxane compositions which are cured by high-energy radiation, such as by gamma-rays, ultraviolet radiation, or electron beams.<br>
Addition reaction-curing organopolysiloxane are preferred for their rapid curing rates 25      and excellent uniformity of curing. A particularly preferred addition reaction-curing organopolysiloxane is prepared from:<br>
(A)	an organopolysiloxane having at least 2 lower alkenyl groups in each molecule;<br>
(B)	an organopolysiloxane having at least 2 silicon-bonded hydrogen atoms in each molecule; and<br>
30      (C)    a platinum-type catalyst.<br>
The crosslinked siloxane elastomer of the present invention may either be an emulsifying or non-emulsifying crosslinked organopolysiloxane elastomer or combinations thereof.<br>
 <br>
The term "non-emuisifying," as used herein, defines crosslinked organopolysiloxane elastomer from which polyoxyalkylene units are absent The term "emulsifying," as used herein,    means   crosslinked    organopolysiloxane   elastomer   having    at   least   one polyoxyalkylene (e.g. polyoxyethylene or polyoxypropylene) unit. 5<br>
Particularly useful emulsifying elastomers are polyoxyalkylene-modified elastomers formed from divinyl compounds, particularly siloxane polymers with at least two free vinyl groups, reacting with 5i-H linkages on a polysiloxane backbone. Preferably the elastomers are dimethyl polysiloxanes crosslinked by Si-H sites on a molecularly spherical 10      MQ resin.<br>
Preferred silicone elastomers are organopolysiloxanes available under the INCI names of dimethicone/vinyl dimethicone crosspolymer, dimethicone crosspolymer and Polysilicone-11. Ordinarily these materials are provided as a 1-30% crosslinked silicone elastomer 15 dissolved or suspended in a dimethicone fluid (usually cyciomethicone). For purposes of definition "crosslinked silicone elastomer" refers to the elastomer alone rather than the total commercial compositions which also include a solvent (eg dimethicone) carrier.<br>
Dimethicone/'vinyl dimethicone crosspofymers and dimethicone crosspolymers are 20 available from a variety of suppliers including Dow Corning (9040, 9041, 9045, 9506 and 9509), General Electric (SFE 839), Shin Etsu (KSG-15, 16, IS [dimethicone/phenyl vinyl dimethicone crosspolymer]) and Grant Industries (Gransil™ line of materials), and lauryl dimethicone/vinyl dimethicone crosspolymers supplied by Shin Etsu (e.g. K5G-31, KSG-32, KSG41, KSG-42, K5G43, and JCSG-44). 25<br>
Other suitable commercially available silicone elastomer powders include vinyl dimethicone/methicone siiesquioxane crosspolymers from Shin-Etsu sold as KSP-100, KSP-101, KSP-102, KSP-103, KSP-104, KSP-105, and hybrid silicone powders that contain a fluoroalkyl group or a phenyl group sold by Shin-Etsu as respectively KSP-200 and KSP-30      300.<br>
The crosslinked silicone elastomers of the present invention may range in concentration from 0.1 to 30%, preferably from 0.1 to 10%, optimally from 0.5 to 2% by weight of the<br>
 <br>
cosmetic composition.  These weight values exclude any solvent such as cyclomethicone found in commercial "elastomer" silicones such as the Dow Corning products 9040 and 9045.   For instance, the amount of crosslinked silicone elastomer in 9040 and 9045 is between 12 and 13% by weight 5<br>
Most preferred as the silicone elastomer is 9045 which has a D5 cyclomethicone swelled elastomer particle size (based on volume and calculated as spherical particles) which averages 38 micron, and may range from 25 to 55 micron.<br>
10      Cosmetically Acceptable Carrier<br>
Compositions of the present invention will include a cosmetically acceptable carrier. The carrier may be a liquid or solid material. Carriers may be present in amounts ranging from 5 to 98%, preferably from 20 to 95%, optimally from 40 to 80% by weight of the cosmetic compositions. Water is the most common carrier for this invention.  Oily<br>
15 carriers in the presence of water and an emulsifier will form emulsion systems as carriers. These systems may either be water-in-oil or oil-in-water emulsions. Besides water, suitable carrier classes include silicones, polyhydric alcohols, fatty alcohols, hydrocarbons, triglycerides and thickening powders.<br>
20 Of importance for incorporating the silicone elastomers into the compositions is the presence of a fluid silicone as a carrier. The silicone carrier, when combined with the cross-Iinlced organopolysiloxane elastomer particles serves to suspend and swell the elastomer particles to provide an elastic, gel-like network or matrix. The carrier for the crosslinked siloxane elastomer is liquid under ambient conditions, and preferably has a<br>
25      low viscosity to provide for improved spreading on the skin.<br>
Concentrations of the fluid silicone may range from 5% to 60%, more preferably from 5% to 40%, by weight of the composition. These silicone fluids may be organic, silicone-containing or fluorine-containing, volatile or non-volatile, polar or non-polar. 30<br>
Particularly preferred volatile silicone oils are cyclic volatile silicones wherein the repeating unit ranges from 3 to 5; and linear silicones wherein the repeating unit ranges from 1 to 7. Highly preferred examples of volatile silicone oils include cyclomethicones of<br>
 <br>
varying viscosities, e.g. Dow Corning 200, Dow Corning 244, Dow Corning 245, Dow Corning 344, and Dow Corning 345, (comnnercially available from Dow Corning Corp.); SF-1204 and 5F-1202 Silicone Fluids, GE 7207 and 7158 (commercially available from G.E. Silicones) and SWS-03314 (commercially available from SWS Silicones Corp. 5<br>
Hydrocarbons may be useful as cosmetically acceptable carriers for compositions of this invention. They may include mineral oil, petrolatum and polyalpha-olefins. Examples of preferred volatile hydrocarbons include polydecanes such as isododecane and isodecane (e.g. Permethyl-99A which is available from Presperse Inc.) and the C7-C8 through C12-10      CIS isoparaffins {such as the Isopar Series available from Exxon Chemicals).<br>
Polyhydric alcohols may serve as carriers. Illustrative of this group are propylyene glycol, dipropylene glycol, polypropylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, sorbitol, hydroxypropyi sorbitol, hexylene glycol, 1,3-butylene glycol, isoprene glycol, ethoxylated glycerol, 15 propoxyfated glycerol and mixtures thereof. Most preferred is glycerol known also as glycerin.<br>
Fatty alcohols may also be useful carriers. The term "fatty" refers to carbon chain lengths ranging from 10 to 30 carbon atoms.  Illustrative of this category are lauryl alcohol, cetyl 20      alcohol, stearyl alcohol, isostearyl alcohol and combinations thereof.<br>
Triglycerides are another group of materials useful as carriers. Illustrative but not limiting are sunflower seed oil, cotton oil, canola oil, soybean oil, castor oil, borage oil, olive oil, shea butter, jojoba oil and mixtures thereof.   Mono- and di- glycerides may also be 25      useful. Illustrative of these categories are glyceryl monostearate and glyceryl distearate.<br>
The carriers can comprise one or more thickening agents, preferably from 0.05% to 10%, more preferably from 0.1% to 5%, and even more preferably from 0.25% to 4%, by weight for the composition.   Non-limiting classes of thickening agents include those 30      selected from the group consisting of:<br>
 <br>
a.      Carboxylic Acid Polymers<br>
These polymers are crosslinked compounds containing one or more monomers<br>
derived from acrylic acid, substituted acrylic acids, and salts and esters of these<br>
acrylic acids and the substituted acrylic adds, wherein the crosslinking agent<br>
5	contains two or more carbon-carbon double bonds and is derived from a polyhydric<br>
alcohol.<br>
Examples of commercially available carboxylic acid polymers useful herein include the Carbomers, which are homopolymers of acrylic acid crosslinked with allyl ethers<br>
10	of sucrose or pentaerytritol.   The Carbomers are available as the Carbopol® 900<br>
series from Noveon Corporation (e.g. Carbopol® 954). In addition, other suitable carboxylic acid polymeric agents include copolymers of C10.30 alkyl acrylates with one or more monomers of acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, or one of their short chain (i.e. C1-4 alcohol) esters, wherein the crosslinking agent is an allyl ether of sucrose or<br>
15	pentaerytriotol.    These copolymers are known as acrylates/C10-30 alkyl acrylate<br>
crosspolymers and are commercially available as Carbopol® 1342, Carbopol® 1382, Ultrez® 21, Pemuien® TR-1 and Pemulen® TR-2, from Noveon Corporation.<br>
b.	Taurate Polymers<br>
20	The compositions of the present invention can optionally comprise crosslinked<br>

The formulas in the examples are prepared in a suitable container first by combining the ingredients of phase A. In a separate suitable container, combine the ingredients of phase B. Heat each phase to 73C-78°C while mixing each phase using a suitable mixer 5 (e.g. anchor blade, propeller blade, IKA T25) until each reaches temperature and is homogenous. Slowly add phase B to phase A while continuing to mix phase A. Continue mixing until batch is uniform. Pour product into suitable containers at 73-78°C and store at room temperature. Alternatively continuing to stir the mixture as temperature decreases results in lower observed hardness values at 21°C and 33°C. 10<br>

Optical Measurements<br>
Opacity is the measure of intensity attenuation of a transmitted light beam shone perpendicular to a medium or film. The higher the direct beam attenuation, the greater will be the opacity. The source of the light beam attenuation is two fold: A) Some of the original light is reflected back from the film/medium. This gives the film/medium a true white/opaque appearance with great hiding power. Using pigment-grade TiO2 in a formulation will give the effect. B) Some of the light is deflected from the straight beam path but still transmitted through the film/medium. In effect the film/medium goes from<br>
 <br>
being transparent to translucent, creating a "blurred" image.  Another term for this is soft focus.<br>
Procedure: Apply (or draw down) a 3 mil (76.2 µm) film of a formulation using a draw 5 down bar on to a plastic overhead transparency sheet. Let the film dry for 2 hours at room temperature. Take the coated overhead transparency and place it in an Instrument Systems goniospectrophotometer. Set the light source and detector arrayed in a straight line perpendicular to the coated transparency. The light source (set at 209 million Watt-nm/cm2 which serves as a reference for all Transmission Intensity Values reported herein)<br>
10 is turned on and the measurement of the transmitted light intensity is made. Further measurements are made by moving the detector 10, 30, 40, 50 degrees away from the direct transmission normal. These values indicate the extent of soft focus light scattering. The Reflectance or "radiance" of a product is determined in the same way as opacity/soft focus light scattering, except for the positions of the light source and detector. The<br>
15 detector is 30 degrees on one side of the normal/perpendicular, while the light source is 20 degrees on the other side. To determine the extent of the intensity attenuation, compare the intensity value to that of an uncoated overhead transparency. The difference between these two values is the extent of the attenuation or opacity.<br>
20      SPF Measurements<br>
Sun protection factor (SPF) was measured in vitro using an Optometries SPF 290 instrument. The test procedure required calibration of the monochrometer and sample stage of the Optometries SPF 290 instrument. Thereafter the instrument was calibrated with a blank sample quartz plate (10 cm x 10 cm and 3 mm thickness). Calibration zeros<br>
25      the UV detector. Formula is applied to a plate using an 1 mil draw-down applicator. This leaves a film of 2 mg/cm^ The film is left to dry for 30 minutes. Subsquently an SPF reading is taken on the dried film using three measurements on different parts of the coated quartz plate and recording an average value.<br>
30      Soft focus results with the formulations are reported in table II.<br>

** OMC is Octylmethoxycinnamate (sunscreen agent)<br>
5     All the composites {UV Pearls, SunCaps, SyIvacI ear/Sunscreen) were formulated to deliver .   2% octylmethoxycinnamate (OMC) to the overall cosmetic composition.<br>
As the OMC sunscreen agent concentration (non-composite) is increased, the soft focus transmission  profile tends lower.     For instance,  formulas  1,  2  and  3  illustrate a 10      progression of increasing Transmission Intensity Values throughout the range of reported angles.<br>
Composite particles (the hydrophilic particles of binder/sunscreen agent) not only maintain the soft focus benefits of the 0% OMC (formula 3) but also exhibit improved<br>
15 (increased) high angle soft focus profile. This is seen in the favorable comparison of higher Transmission Intensity Values for formulas 4, 5 and 6 against formula 3. Moreover, formulas 4, 5 and 6 all have an SPF higher than 15 (achieved with only a 2% OMC loading by weight of the cosmetic composition). Also of note is that the composites improved (lowered) opacity and increased reflectance.  Formula 9 is identical<br>
20 to formula 6 except that the former contains no crosslinked silicone elastomer. Absent the elastomer, the formula at several Transmission angles exhibits lower performance values.<br>
 <br>
6. A composition according to any one of the preceding daims wherein the crosslinked silicone elastomer has a particle size ranging from 25,000 to 55,000 nm.</td>
