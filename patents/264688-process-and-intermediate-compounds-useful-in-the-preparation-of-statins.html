allow for the selective removal of only P1 or P2. Preferably, when the protecting groups P1<br>
and P2 are different, P1 is a silyl group and P2 is a methyl group.<br>
Protecting groups which may be represented by R1 include alcohol protecting<br>

present. The alkenyl group may carry one or more substituents, particularly phenyl<br>
substituents. Examples of alkenyl groups include vinyl, styryl and indenyl groups.<br>
Aryl groups which may be represented by R, Rb, R1 and R4-10 may contain 1 ring or<br>

a heterocyclic group, preferably attachment is provided through a carbon atom in the R,<br>
R1 or R4-10 group. Examples of heterocyclic groups which may be represented by R, R1<br>
and R4-10 include pyridyl, pyrimidyl, pyrrolyl, thiophenyl, furanyl, indolyl, quinolyl,<br>
isoquinolyl, imidazoyl, triazoyl and tetrazoyl groups.<br>
When any of R, R1 and R4-10 is a substituted hydrocarbyl group, the substituent(s)<br>

sources include hydroxide salts, especially ammonium or alkali metal hydroxides,<br>
particularly lithium, sodium or potassium hydroxide, and various aqueous media such as<br>
water in the presence of basic media such as N-methylpryrrolidinone, HMPA, AI2O3,<br>
CaCO3, Na2CO3, K2CO3 or KO2/18-crown-6, silver salts such as AgNO3 or Ag2O, or<br>
oxidants such perbenzioc acid. A particularly preferred process comprises contacting the<br>
compound of formula (1) with 5 molar equivalents of KOH in the presence of<br>
dimethylsulfoxide solvent at a temperature of, for example, about 50°C.<br>
Alternatively, hydroxylation may be achieved by first displacing the halogen with a<br>
leaving group such as acetate, triflate or sulphate optionally in the presence of a silver<br>
salt, then displacing the leaving group with a hydroxide source. A particularly preferred<br>
process comprises contacting the compound of formula (1) with 3 molar equivalents of<br>
NaOAc in the presence of dimethylformamide solvent and tetra-n-butylammonium chloride<br>
at a temperature of, for example, about 100°C, isolating the acetyl compound and<br>
contacting with potassium carbonate in the presence of methanol solvent and at a<br>
temperature of, for example, about 0°C.<br>
Oxidation of compounds of formula (2) can be achieved using oxidation systems<br>
known in the art for the oxidation of alcohols, especially those known in the art for the<br>
oxidation of primary alcohols. Examples include oxidation with Dess-Martin periodinane,<br>
bromine, Swern oxidation or various metal based oxidations such as Fetizon reagent,<br>
manganate based reagents, and chromate based reagents such as Collins reagent.<br>
Swern oxidation is preferred. When Swern oxidation is employed, preferred conditions<br>
comprise the use of dimethyl sulphoxide and oxalyl chloride or bromine in a solvent such<br>
as dichloromethane or dichlormethane/THF mixtres, at reduced temperature, such as<br>
from 0 to -100°C, preferably -50 to -80°C. Preferably, reagents are added at reduced<br>
temperature, such as -30 to -80°C, and then once all reagents are added, the reaction<br>
mixture is allowed to warm to 15 to 20°C.<br>
The coupling of the compound of formula (3) with the compound of formula (4)<br>
may employ conditions analogous to those given in Bull. Chem. Soc. Japan 1995, 68,<br>
364-372, Tet. Lett. 1992, 33(49), 7525-75226, Tetrahedron 1997, 53(31) 10659-10670<br>
and WO01/85702. The conditions preferably comprise reacting the compounds of formula<br>
(3) and (4) in a hydrocarbon solvent, such as THF, toluene or cyclohexane, or mixtures<br>
thereof, optionally in the presence of a base, followed by contact with aqueous acid, such<br>
as aqueous HCI.<br>
Alkyl, aryl, alkoxy or aryloxy groups which may be represented by R11 and R12<br>
include Chalky! groups, such as methyl and ethyl groups, C8-12aryl groups, such phenyl,<br>
tolyl or naphthyl, C1-6alkoy groups, such as ethoxy groups, and C6-12aryloxy groups such<br>
as phenoxy groups.<br>
Anions which may be represented by X include halide.<br>
8<br><br>
Z preferably is P(=O)R11R12 where R7 and R8 each independently is an alkyl, aryl,<br>
alkoxy or aryloxy group, preferably a phenyl group.<br>
When W represents OP2, the protecting group may be removed to form a hydroxy<br>
group by methods known in the art for the removal of the given protecting group. For<br>
example, silyl protecting groups may be removed by contact with a source of fluoride ion,<br>
such as tetrabutylammonium fluoride.<br>
Oxidation of compounds formed by deprotection of compounds wherein W<br>
represents -OP2 may employ conditions known in the art for the oxidation of pyranols to<br>
pyranones, and include those given in "Comprehensive Organic Transformations", R.C.<br>
Larock, 2nd Ed (1999) p 1670, published by Wiley VCH, incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Preferred oxidation systems include Ag2CO3/Celite, especially Celite J2, bromine or<br>
Swern.<br>
Ring opening of the compounds of formula (5), when W represent =0 or formula<br>
(6) may employ conditions known in the art for ring opening of a pyranone. Preferably,<br>
the ring is opened by contact with a base, such as sodium hydroxide. Conveniently, polar<br>
solvents are employed, for example methanol, acetonitrile, tetrahydrofuran or mixtures<br>
thereof.<br>
Remaining protecting groups may be removed by methods known in the art for the<br>
removal of the given protecting group. For example, silyl protecting groups may be<br>
removed by contact with a source of fluoride ion, such as tetrabutylammonium fluoride.<br>
It will also be recognised that compounds of formulae (2), (3) and (5) may also be<br>
subjected to oxidation (when W represents -OH) or deprotection and oxidation (when W<br>
represents (-O-protecting group) to form the corresponding compound wherein W<br>
represents =0.<br>
Reduction of the compounds of formula (5), (6) or (7) may employ conditions<br>
known in the art for the reduction of double bonds. For example, hydrogenation using<br>
hydrogen gas in the present of transition metals or transition metal catalysts such as<br>
hydrogen in the presence of group VIII metal or metal catalyst, especially Ru, Rh, Pd, Ir or<br>
Pt metals or metal based catalysts.<br>

compound of formula 4 wherein Z=PO(Ph)2 in 10ml dry THF, cooling to -60°C and then<br>
adding 0.2ml of a 2M solution of sodium hexamethyldisilazide. After 20min, a solution of<br>
0.1 g formyl-O-benzyl-lactol methyl acetal in 10ml dry THF at -30°C is added. The reaction<br>
mixture is then maintained at this temperature for 8 hours and monitored by tic. The<br>
reaction mixture is allowed to slowly warm up to 20°C. Glacial acetic (5mls) acid is then<br>
charged to quench the reaction. Water (5mls) is also charged to the mixture. The solvent<br>
is then removed in vacuo and reconstituted with toluene (15mls) and water (15mls). The<br>
upper organic layer is then separated and the aqueous layer is then washed with ethyl<br>
acetate (15 mis). The combined organics are then dried and the solvent removed in<br>
vacuo to yield an oil containing a mixture of isomers, that can be purified by<br>
chromatography.<br>
