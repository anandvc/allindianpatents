				<td>PYRROLO[3,2-bYRIDINE DERIVATIVES AND PROCESSES FOR THE PREPARATION THEREOF<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to novel pyrrolo[3,2-b]pyridine derivatives or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof which have an excellent inhibitory activity against gastric acid secretion, processes for the preparation thereof, and pharmaceutical compositions comprising the same.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Peptic ulcer disease occurs when offensive factors involving gastric acid secretion are strong or defensive factors of gastric mucous are weak. For the treatment of peptic ulcer disease, various drugs such as antacid, anticholinergic agent, Ha-receptor antagonist, and proton pump inhibitor have been used. The advent of omeprazole as a proton pump inhibitor has rekindled research activities in this field.<br>
However, it has been pointed out that proton pump inhibition by omeprazole is irreversible, thereby incurring long-term inhibition of gastric acid secretion, which may induce side effects. Accordingly, various attempts to develop a reversible proton pump inhibitor are being made. For example, imidazopyridine derivatives are disclosed in WO 98/37,080 (AstraZeneca AB), WO 00/17,200 (Byk Gulden Lomberg Chem.), and U.S. Patent No. 4,450,164 (Schering Corporation) as a reversible proton pump inhibitor. Further, pyrimidine derivatives are also disclosed in European Patent No. 775,120 (Yuhan Corp.).<br>

Test Example 1. Inhibitory effects on proton pump (H+/K+-ATPase) activity<br>
1-1. Preparation of gastric proton pump vesicles<br>
The hog fundic regions containing parietal and peptic cells were scraped with slide-glass. The collected cells were suspended in 10 ml of 0.25M sucrose buffer and homogenized using a tight-fitting Teflon-glass homogenizer. The homogenate was centrifuged for 35 min at 8,000 rpm and the pellet was discarded. The supernatant was further centrifuged for 75 min at 25,000 rpm. The resulting pellets were re-suspended in the sucrose buffer (10 ml), and then the suspension was laid onto discontinuous density gradients consisting of 0.25M sucrose buffer and isolation medium containing 9% Ficoll (w/w). After being centrifuged for 3 hours and 15 minutes at 100,000 x g, the material at the interface of sucrose buffer and Ficoll solution was collected and then centrifuged for 40 minutes at 100,000 x g. The resulting pellets were re-suspended in 1 ml of 5 mM Hepes/Tris buffer (pH 6.1). This material was lyophilized and stored at -VOui and used as an enzyme source of the in vitro enzyme reaction assay of proton pump.<br>
1 -2. Measurement of inhibitory effects on proton pump (H+/K+-ATPase) activity The inhibitory effects of the compounds of the present invention against proton pump activity were evaluated in 96-well plate. In this assay, the K+ specific H+/K+-ATPase activity was calculated based on the difference between the activity of H+/K+-ATPase activity with K+ and without K+ ion. In 96-well plate, 1% dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) in buffer was added to negative and positive control groups and the diluted compounds of the present invention in buffer were added to test group. All assays were performed in 100 reaction volume at room temperature, and the hog gastric vesicle was kept in ice before use. At the beginning of the reaction, 10 of reaction buffer containing 1% DMSO was added to the negative and positive control groups and to each concentration of compounds in the test group. Then lyophilized vesicle in 5mM Pipes/Tris buffer (pH 6.1) was pre-incubated in the presence of various concentrations of test compounds. After a 5 minute incubation, negative and positive buffers were respectively added to the previous reaction mixture. As the substrate, ATP was added to the reaction buffer, and incubated for 30 minutes at 37u . Enzymatic activity was stopped by the addition of colorimetric reagent (2X malachite green, IX ammonium molybdate, IX polyvinyl alcohol, 2X H2O) and the amount of mono phosphate (Pi) in the reaction was measured at 620nm using the micro plate reader (Genios Pro, TECAN). The difference between the Pi production with K+ and without K+ is taken as K+ stimulated H+/K+-ATPase activity. The IC50s<br>

Test Example 2. Inhibitory effects on basal gastric acid secretion in pylorus-ligated rats Inhibitory effects of the compounds of the present invention on basal gastric acid secretion were performed according to Shay's rat model (Shay, H., et al., 1945, gastroenterology,<br>
5, 43-61). Male Sprague Dawley (SD) rats (200 ± 10 g body weight) were divided into 3 groups (n=5) and fasted for 24 hours with free access to water. Control group was orally administered with 0.5% methylcellulose alone and the other groups were orally administered with test compounds suspended in 0.5% methylcellulose solution at doses of 1, 3 and 10 mg/kg/5ml one hour before pylorus ligation.<br>
Under ether anesthesia, the abdomens of the rats were incised and then the pylorus was ligated. 5 hours after ligation, the animals were sacrificed, and the gastric contents were collected. The collected contents were centrifuged at 1,000 x g for 10 minutes to obtain the gastric juice. Total acid output was measured by O.OIN NaOH volume (ueq/ml) for automatic titration of the gastric juice to pH 7.0 and the ED50s of test compounds were calculated using the Litchfield-Wilcoxon method. % inhibitory activity was calculated from the following equation and the results are shown in Table 2.<br>
% inhibitory activity of test compound = (total acid output of control group - total acid output of the group treated with test compounds) / total acid output of control group X 100Table 2As shown in Table 2, the compounds of the present invention have potent inhibition activities <br>

Test Example 3. Reversible inhibition of hog gastric H+/K+-ATPase<br>
3-1. Preparation of gastric vesicles<br>
Gastric vesicles were prepared from hog fundic mucosa using the method of Saccomani et al. (Saccomani G, Stewart HB, Shqw D, Lewin M and Sachs G, Characterization of gastric mucosal membranes. IX. Fraction and purification of K-ATPase-containing vesicles by zonal centrifugation and free-flow electrophoresis techinque. Biochem. Biophy. Acta.(BBA) -Biomembranes 465, 311-330, 1977.). This material was lyophilized and stored atThe protein content of gastric vesicles was determined by the Bradford method using bovine serum albumin as a standard (Bradford MM, A rapid and sensitive method for the quantitation of microgram quantities of protein utilizing the principle of protein-dye binding. Anal Biochem. 72, 248-254, 1976).<br>
3-2. Determination of reversible inhibition of hog gastric H+/K+-ATPase Activity of ATPase in hog microsome (lyophilized vesicle) was measured by the inorganic phosphate released from ATP using an one-step colorimetric detection method at the concentration at which the test compounds have 50% inhibition of the proton pump (Chan KM, Delfert D, and Junger KD, A direct colorimetric assay for Ca2+-stimulated ATPase activity. Anal Biochem, 157, 375-380, 1986). The mode of action of test compounds on H+/K+-ATPase was investigated according to the Washout method (Beil W, Staar U, and Sewing KF, Substituted thieno[3,4-d]imidazoles, a novel group of H+/K+-ATPase inhibitors. Differentiation of their inhibition characteristics from those of omeprazole. Eur. J. Pharmacol, 187, 455-67, 1990).<br>
Lyophilized vesicle in the solution of 5mM Pipes/Tris buffer was pre-incubated in the presence of the test compounds (the compounds of Examples 50, 64, and 94) at the concentration at which it has 50% inhibition of the proton pump. The previous reaction buffer was added with 2mM MgCl2, 50mM KC1, 5uM Valinomycin, and 0.5mM ATP and then incubated for 30 minutes at 3 . The H+/K+-ATPase activity was measured using the colorimetric detection method and then the test sample was centrifuged at 100,000 x g for 1 hr. The vesicles are present in the form of pellets in the test sample. The supernatant thereof was replaced with the same buffer not having the test compound. The test sample was pre-incubated for 5 minutes at room temperature and then incubated further for 30 minutes at 37u . The H+/K+-ATPase activity was also measured using the colorimetric detection method. The H+/K+-ATPase activity before washout and after washout in the test sample was analyzed, in comparison with those in the non-treated group.<br>
As a result, the compounds of Examples 50, 64, and 94 inhibited H+/K+-ATPase activity by 50% before washout and did not inhibit H+/K+-ATPase activity after washout; the gastric H+/K+-ATPase activities by the compounds of Examples 50, 64, and 94 were completely recovered to non-treated group level after washout. These results confirm that the compounds of formula (I) exhibited reversible inhibition of the gastric H+/K+-ATPase.<br><br><br>
