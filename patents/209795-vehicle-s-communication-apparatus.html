COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10]<br>
"VEHICLE'S COMMUNICATION APPARATUS")<br>
HONDA GIKEN KOGYO KABUSHIKI KAISHA, a corporation of Japan, having a place of business at 1-1, Minamiaoyama 2-chome, Minato-ku, Tokyo, Japan<br>
/ /<br>
Tbe   following   specification, ^^particularly   describes   the   nature   of  the invention and the manner in #Mch it is to be' performed :-<br><br>
[Detailed Description of the Invention] 4^0013 -<br>
[Technical Field of the Invention]<br>
The present invention generally relates to a communication apparatus for a vehicle. More particularly, the present invention relates to a vehicle's communication apparatus capable of further deepening the feeling of intimacy of the driver and / or the owner of the vehicle with the vehicle, and the affection of the driver and / or the owner of the vehicle for the vehicle. It should be noted that the driver and / or the owner are regarded as a generic group referred to hereafter as the<br><br>
user.<br>
[Prior Art]<br>
As disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid-open No. Hei 11-250395, there has been proposed an apparatus for displaying an expression subject resembling a human being, an animal or an animation character in a vehicle as a planar or cubic picture and making the user aware of information such as the state of the vehicle and the condition of a road by means of the Repression subject<br>
which is referred to hereafter as a /pseudo creatur^^<br>
Particularly, in this specification, a plurality of kinds of information different from each other is reported to the user through a plurality of pseudo creatures. ,.[0003]-<br>
[Problems to be Solved by the Invention]<br>
By virtue of the conventional apparatus described above, expression of a pseudo creature is expected to allow the user to recognize information such as the condition of the vehicle as information of intimacy. Since displayed pseudo creatures are limited to only (those setXin the vehicle in advance, however, the expression of the pseudo creatures cannot be said to be necessarily sufficient for satisfying the user's strong<br><br><br>
desiije for a variety of hobbies. In addition, since the user is capable of communicating with such pseudo creatures only while the user is present inside the car, it is feared that the user's affection for the car unavoidably weakens.<br>
4«-etr5T<br>
It is thus an object of the present invention addressing the problems described above to provide a vehicle's communication apparatus capable of satisfying the user's strong desire for a variety of hobbies,<br>
serving as an effective means for/'arousing t^e user's affection for the vehicle and sustaining a good running condition of the vehicle.<br><br>
In the conventional vehicle communication apparatus, the pseudo creature communicates with the driver only through a picture and a sound. Thus, as a means for giving the driver an impression that the vehicle and the pseudo creature are one, the conventional communication apparatus is not a sufficiently complete apparatus.  In particular, unlike a four-wheel vehicle, a motor-bicycle d.oes not have a cabin. Thus, introduction of light and sound generated by external sources to the driver of a motor-bicycle is not restricted. As a result, there are<br><br>
many cases in which, communication is difficult to establish merely by using pictures and sounds only.<br>
It is thus a second object of the present invention addressing this problem to provide a vehicle communication apparatus capable of arousing the user's intimacy with and affection for the vehicle by  giving the user an impression that the vehicle and the pseudo creature are one.<br>
In the conventional vehicle communication apparatus, the pseudo creature communicates only with the driver but not with other users of the vehicle.<br>
It is a third object of the present invention addressing this problem to provide a vehicle communication apparatus capable of implementing not only communications between the pseudo creature and the user, but also a variety ofVkinds of communication^etween the pseudo creature and pther communication partners\ including users of other vehicles. '[0009t<br>

Furthermore, the meter unit 9 can also be provided with a microphone and a speaker system capable of generating a sound.  It should be noted that neither the microphone nor the speaker system is shown in the figure.<br>
The state of the vehicle or the like can not only be displayed on the communication display unit 92, but can also be expressed by auxiliary instruments provided on the vehicle.  Examples of the auxiliary instruments are functional components such as the head light 8, the horn 10, the front winkers 37L and 37R, the tail light unit 43 and the speaker system./ That is to say, in this embodiment, the whole vehicle i^ assumed to be\ a pseudo<br>
creature. \The vehicle assumed to be a pseudo creature has a configuration to make the user aware of information such as the state of the vehicle and data obtained as a result of communication between the vehicle and another electronic information-processing apparatus by driving the vehicle's display functions including the auxiliary instruments.  In the communication display unit 92 shown in Fig. 4, for example, the amount of residual fuel is<br><br><br>
displayed as the character F representing a full fuel tank, the character E representing an empty fuel tank and one of circular indicators between the characters F and E. At the same time, in the case of a state close to an empty fuel tank, a character representing the pseudo creature is displayed along with a feeling-expressing phrase stating: "I am hungry." In this example, the character representing the pseudo creature is a picture of a rabbit.<br>
Fig. 5 is a diagram showing another typical character representing the pseudo creg,ture. As shown in Fig. 5, the state of the residual fuel in the fuel tank is displayed on the communication display unit 92 as a circular indicator representing a state close to a full fuel tank along with a phrase stating: "I am full" to indicate that fuel has been replenished.<br>
Next, the pseudo creature's typical expressions<br>
through a variety of display means provided on the vehicle are explained. The display means include instruments provided in advance on the vehicle for typically safety purposes.  First of all, equipment of the vehicle serving as the pseudo creature is explained from<br><br><br>
the standpoint of a means for mainly displaying information. Fig. 6 is a block diagram showing the configuration of the meter unit 9 and components connected to the meter unit 9 and mounted on the vehicle.<br>

 information to and from another electronic information-<br>
processing apparatus. The connection interface 65 serves<br><br><br>
as an interface with external components. 44)030]<br>
Running data is supplied to the CPU 50.  The running data includes a distance measured by a running-distance measurement unit 64 and pieces of information on the state of the vehicle, which are detected by instruments such as a speed sensor 56, an engine rotation sensor (Ne sensor) 57, a residual- fuel-amount sensor (fuel sensor) 58, an oil-amount sensor (oil sensor) 59, a throttle sensor 60, an engine-cooling-water-temperature sensor (water-temperature sensor) 61 and a battery-voltage meter 74.<br>
Fig. 7 is a block diagram showing electronic information-processing apparatuses connected to the CPU 50.  The transmission &amp; reception unit 63 is capable of transmitting and receiving information to and from a personal computer 66 referred to hereafter simply as a PC, a hand phone 67 and a fax machine 68 including a telephone through a public communication line.  The transmission &amp; reception unit 63 also has a function for transmitting and receiving information to and from a meter unit mounted on another vehicle 69 through radio communication, and a function for receiving a command to<br><br><br>
turn on a power supply from a remote controller 70 capable of transmitting a radio signal.  In addition, the connection interface 65 is connected to apparatuses such as a PC 71, a hand phone 72 connectable to the Internet and a computer game machine 73. JJ^A 0 ] --<br>
The following description explains typical processing to express the state of the vehicle or the like by means of the meter unit 9 with the configuration described above.  The left column of Figs. 8 to 10 shows operations carried out by the user and states of the vehicle whereas the right column shows commands issued by the CPU 50 to the communication display unit 92 and the auxiliary instruments in response to, among other things, the operations on the left column, which are carried out by the user.  Figs. 11 to 13 are each an illustration diagram for helping the reader visually better understand operations carried out in response to commands shown in Figs. 8 to 10.  To begin with, before getting on the vehicle, the user carries out an operation denoted by a symbol Ml shown in Fig. 8. To be more specific, the user turns on a remote control switch 70 when the seat switch 52 is in an off state. As a reaction Rl to the operation Ml, a blinking command is issued to the front winkers 37L<br><br><br>
and 37R as well as the tail light 43, a start command is issued to the engine and a forcing command to the horn 10 In accordance with these commands, the front winkers 37L and 37R as well as the tail light 43 including the rear winkers are each put in a blinking state, the engine is started and the horn 10 is forcibly turned on for a predetermined period of time, which is typically 0.5 seconds.<br>
The operations of these auxiliary instruments are expressed by behaviors or states of the pseudo creature. To be more specific, the blinking state of the winkers and the tail light is expressed by winks or tail movements of the pseudo creature.  The start of the engine is expressed by waking of the pseudo creature and a sound generated by the horn 10 is expressed by a cry of the pseudo creature. The operations are carried out by the auxiliary instruments before the user gets on the vehicle in order to provide enjoyment to the eyes of the user and convenience to the user in finding out the vehicle in a short period of time at, for example, a dark place or in a parking area where a number of motor-bicycles are parked. The operations of these auxiliary instruments may be terminated in a predetermined period of time such as 5<br><br><br>
seconds, or terminated in response to a next operation M2.<br>
It should be noted that, instead of carrying out the operation Ml on the remote control switch 70, the user may also call out to the auxiliary instruments by outputting a voice command.  In this case, the voice command issued by the user is recognized by typically comparing the command with a voice waveform cataloged in advance.<br>
The operation M2 is the behavior of the user to sit on the seat 32 or an operation to turn the seat switch 52 on, and an operation to turn on the power-supply switch 38. As a reaction R2 to the operation M2, a greeting message from the vehicle is displayed on the communication display unit 92 and a pseudo sound such as "wing" or "piropiro" is generated electronically from the speaker 53 in response to the operations to turn on the seat switch and the power-supply switch 38.  Then, a physical-condition message is displayed on the communication display unit 92 to inform the user of the condition of the vehicle.<br>
Examples of the greeting message are "Good morning",<br><br><br>
"I haven't seen you for a long time" and "A happy birthday".  Determination to display the "Good morning" greeting message is based on information on time obtained from the clock unit of the CPU 50.  In dependence on the information on time, a "Good afternoon" or "Good evening" greeting message may be displayed instead of the "Good morning" message. The "I haven't seen you for a long time" greeting message is displayed when a time longer than a predetermined period has lapsed since the last operation to turn off the power-supply key.  The "A happy birthday" greeting message is displayed on the user's birthday, which is typically stored in advance in a memory of the CPU 50.  To put it in detail, the calendar function compares each day with the stored birthday and, when a day matches the stored birthday, the "A happy birthday" greeting message is displayed.  Examples of the physical-condition message are "I am extremely well" and "Today, let's go to a far place". Determination to display a physical-condition message is based on information on the amount of residual fuel obtained from the fuel sensor 58 and information on the amount of residual oil obtained from the oil sensor 59.<br>
An operation M3 is an operation to temporarily halt<br><br><br>
the vehicle in the course of running. As a reaction R3 to this operation M3, a message saying: "We have been traveling a long distance." is displayed on the communication display unit 92 after a period of 2 seconds has lapsed since the vehicle was halted or the speed of the vehicle reached a zero at an intersection on a red traffic light for example.  Determination to display the "We have been traveling a long distance." character string is based on a travel distance. As an alternative,<br>
a message saying: "The lucky color of today is 	." is<br>
displayed on the communication display unit 92. Determination to display the "The lucky color of today is<br>
	." character string is based on information on a color<br>
stored in advance along with the birthday of the user. As another alternative, an access to a weather forecast service office is made through a public communication line to acquire a weather forecast, and a typical "It may rain." message obtained as a result of the access is displayed.  In this case, it is desirable to set the weather forecast service office to provide the vehicle with information on a weather forecast in the form of typically an identification code recognizable by the meter unit in response to a predetermined signal transmitted by the vehicle to make a request for the<br><br><br>
information on a weather forecast. By doing so, the CPU 50 is capable of recognizing the identification code representing the information on a weather forecast and, hence, capable of selecting a weather-forecast message to be displayed. ^^■e04G]<br>
In place of information on a weather forecast presented by an external source, it is also possible to display a weather-forecast message based on data such as calendar information, information on time and information on brightness.  Typically, the information on brightness is based on a voltage output by a photoelectric conversion device provided typically on the surface of the meter unit 9. When the weather is judged to be not promising in spite of a day time during a rainy season, for example, a message saying typically: "It may rain." can be displayed.<br>
A symbol M4 represents a state in which the amount of residual fuel is smaller than a predetermined value. As a reaction R4 to this state M4, a string of characters urging the user to replenish fuel is displayed on the communication display unit 92.  Examples of such a character string are "I am hungry." and "Let's go to a<br><br><br>
gasoline station.".  If the lack of fuel remains as before even after a predetermined time has lapsed or a predetermined distance has been traveled since the issuance of the message urging the user to replenish fuel, a typical string of characters saying: "I can no longer run." is displayed or a "piropiro" sound is generated electronically.  In place of such a character string or along with the string of characters, illumination of the screen of the communication display unit 92 is changed to give the user a warning.<br>
An operation M5 is carried out to recognize the condition of the vehicle. An example of the operation M5 is an operation carried out by the user to grip and release the two brake levers 39 and 40 twice.  This example is analogous to a double click of the computer operation.  In this case, an operation to turn the brake switch 51 on and off is carried out twice within a predetermined period of time. As a reaction R5 to the operation M5, a string of characters saying: "A very good condition." is displayed on the communication display unit 92 to indicate that the amount of residual fuel and the amount of residual oil each exceed a predetermined quantity, or a string of characters saying: "I am still<br><br><br>
sleepy." is displayed on the communication display unit 92 to indicate that the temperature of the cooling water has not increased to a predetermined value. As another message, a string of characters saying: "It is cold today." is displayed on the communication display unit 92 to indicate that the temperature of the cooling water is still low in spite of the fact that a predetermined time has lapsed since an operation to start the engine.  It should be noted that the operation M5 can be carried out as a substitute for an operation carried out on the display-switching button 93.<br>
In addition, if a small amount of residual oil or a long traveled distance is detected in the operation M5, a string of characters saying: "You had better change the oil." is displayed on the communication display unit 92. If a low battery voltage is detected in the operation M5, a string of characters saying: "The electric charge of the battery is about to run out." is displayed on the communication display unit 92.  If an idle cell motor is detected in the operation M5, a string of characters saying: "Let's us see a doctor." is displayed on the communication display unit 92.  If no action is taken to correct the poor physical condition or the poor state of<br><br><br>
the vehicle, a typical string of characters saying: "I can no longer run." is displayed, a "piropiro" sound is generated electronically or illumination of the screen of the communication display unit 92 is changed to give the user a warning as is the case with the prompt for an action to replenish oil. J.0Q50]<br>
A symbol M6 denotes a state in which a predetermined distance has been traveled or a predetermined time has lapsed since the user got onto the vehicle for the first time. As a reaction R6 to a state in which a predetermined distance has been traveled, a string of characters saying: "You have done much." or "We have traveled a pretty long distance." is displayed on the communication display unit 92. As a reaction R6 to a state in which a predetermined time has lapsed, a string of characters saying; "Three months have lapsed since the time we saw each other last." is displayed on the communication display unit 92.<br>
A symbol M7 denotes a state in which an incoming call arrives at the hand phone carried by the user. As a reaction R7 to this state M7 in which an incoming call arrives, illumination of the screen of the communication<br><br><br>
display unit 92 is changed and a string of characters saying: "There is a phone call." "Halt the vehicle at a safe place." or "Who is calling?" is displayed on the communication display unit 92.  In order to detect the arrival of a call at the hand phone carried by the user, there are provided a memory area for storing identification information corresponding to the number of the hand phone owned by the user and an identification-information-determining means for detecting the arrival of a call matching the identification information.<br>
[&amp;e^^—<br>
A symbol M8 denotes a state in which the immobilize system 55 is operating. To put it in detail, in the state M8, the immobilize system 55 is forced to operate without operating a regular key when the vehicle is moved. As a reaction RB to the forced operation MB of the immobilize system 55, the horn 10 is driven and at least one of the lights is put in a blinking state to represent a reaction taken by the pseudo creature. As an alternative, a call to a phone number cataloged in advance is made. As another alternative, a fax machine or a PC cataloged in advance is activated to be informed of the vehicle's present position based on information on a position generated by the GPS unit 62.  In a reaction taken to<br><br><br>
inform the fax machine or the PC of the present position of the vehicle, the map of an area in which the vehicle is located can also be transmitted to the fax machine or the PC.<br>
An operation M9 is an operation carried out to catalog personal information on the user such as the birthday and the name of the user. That is to say, the operation M9 is carried out so as to store basic data used for displaying the string of characters saying: "The<br>
lucky color of today is 	." in response to the<br>
operation M3 or "Three months have lapsed since the time we saw each other last." in response to the state M6.<br>
An operation MIO is an operation carried out by the vehicle when the vehicle meets another vehicle having a meter unit of the same type. When a friend's scooter set in advance arrives at a location within a predetermined distance, approaching the vehicle, the vehicle carries out this operation MIO. Assume that the scooter of the friend has a meter unit with a set pseudo creature of the same type as the vehicle.  In this case, in order to recognize the position of the scooter belonging to the friend, a calling signal is transmitted to the scooter.  A<br><br><br>
signal received from the partner in response to the calling signal indicates that the approaching partner is located at a near location.  In addition, it is also possible to make a request for an accurate result of position detection by using the GPS unit 62. When the position of the scooter of the friend is close to the vehicle as such, as a reaction RIO to the operation MIO, a string of characters saying: "Wow, K is approaching." or "A long time has passed since we last saw K." is displayed on the communication display unit 92 to inform the user that the friend is coming closer.<br>
In addition, not only can an operation be carried out to display a string of characters on the communication display unit 92, but a communication with a meter unit 9 mounted on the scooter of the friend can also be established typically to notify the friend of the user's own status such as the fact that the user is approaching the friend. For example, it is possible to display a string of characters saying typically: "Hello, K." on the communication display unit 92 of the scooter owned by the friend.  In addition, voice information can also be transmitted through the microphone 34 to the meter unit 9 mounted on the scooter of the friend. An<br><br><br>
example of the voice information is a message saying: "I will see you at the AA convenient store.." ■<br>
An operation Mil is an operation to connect the vehicle to the game machine 73. As a result Rll of this connection operation Mil, the pseudo creature representing the vehicle is allowed to participate in a game.  Assume that the game machine 73 has been designed into a configuration in which characters appearing on the stage can be changed or the number of such characters can be increased.  Then, by connecting the meter unit 9 to the game machine 7 3 and by cataloging the name of the pseudo creature representing the vehicle in the game machine 73 as the name of a character participating in the game, it is possible to let the pseudo creature representing the vehicle join the game as a game-participant character of the game machine 73.  In this case, the progress of the game can be changed by using traveling data of the vehicle. For example, the power of the character rises or a hidden character is let appear on the stage in accordance with an increase in traveled distance.  In addition, the power of a character increases or decreases in accordance with a variation in residual-fuel amount or a change in residual-oil amount.<br><br><br>
It should be noted that in the case of a portable game machine serving as the game machine 73, the game machine 73 is used while the vehicle is being parked so that, by allowing the pseudo creature representing the vehicle to participate in a game, the user can enjoy the game.  In addition, the user can enjoy the game having abundant variable substances such as changes in character power with the traveled distance in the course of the game. <br>
An operation M12 is an operation to connect the vehicle to the PC 71.  For example, game software is loaded onto the PC 71, which is provided with a function to transmit data for displaying a character appearing in a game to the meter unit 9. As a result R12 of this connection operation M12, the CPU 50 is capable of communicating with the PC 71, receiving the data for displaying a character of the game software and storing the data in a memory.  It should be noted that, in order to display a character downloaded from the PC 71 on the communication display unit 92 in accordance with the condition of the vehicle, the received data is processed by adoption of a predetermined algorithm matching the<br><br><br>
condition of the vehicle.  By downloading the data for displaying a character, it is possible to set a pseudo creature matching a hobby of the user in the meter unit 9 It should be noted that the function to download game software can also be provided in the game machine 73.  In this case, the operation M12 is carried out to connect the vehicle to the game machine 73.<br>
A character representing a pseudo creature is not limited to those read out from game software.  Instead, it is also possible to use a character created by using the PC 71.  In a word, any character can be used for representing the pseudo creature as long as data related to the character is acquired from an external electronic information-processing apparatus connected to the meter unit employed in the vehicle directly or through the Internet.<br><br>
In addition, if the PC 71 includes software for diagnosing the operation of a vehicle based on the running data of the vehicle, it is also possible to determine the operating condition of the vehicle on the basis of running data supplied by the CPU 50. A result of the diagnosis can then be displayed on the communication<br><br><br>
display unit 92. <br>
Since the CPU 50 is capable of transmitting running data along with the identification information of the vehicle to a PC 71, in the case of a PC 71 owned by a motor-bicycle dealer, the dealer is capable of informing the vehicle of a periodical inspection through a public communication line, for example, when it is time to carry out a periodical inspection on the vehicle.  If the motor-bicycle dealer transmits picture information as a notice of a periodical inspection to the vehicle, information on an inspection facility can be included in the notice and displayed as a picture on the communication display unit 92.  The information on an inspection facility can be reported to the user by using a message of the pseudo creature received by the motor-bicycle dealer.  In this way, the user pays more attention to the information on an inspection facility and can recognize the necessity of maintenance with ease. As a result, the user can have the vehicle receive a maintenance service with good timing and have more trust in the motor-bicycle dealer.  In addition, the user is allowed to enjoy more visible variations in comparison with a message expressed by a monotonous string of characters.<br><br><br>
An operation M13 is an operation to connect the vehicle to the hand phone 72 having a function to connect itself to the Internet. As a result R13 of this connection operation M13, it is possible to display-information such as fortune-telling information and information on a weather forecast, which are acquired by the hand phone 72 through the Internet, on the communication display unit 92. ■[OOG3 3-<br>
It should be noted that a figure can be added to each of the character strings displayed in response to the operations and the states shown in Figs. 8 to 10.  In addition, a response can be displayed as a figure only. In particular, it is desirable to let a character representing a pseudo creature appear on the screen of the communication display unit 92, expressing information to be delivered.<br>
[Effects of the Invention]<br>
As is obvious from the above descriptions, in accordance with the inventions according to claims 1 to 4, since a pseudo creature can be introduced from electronic media such as Internet media, a computer game machine and<br><br><br>
a PC, it is possible to set pseudo creatures suiting tastes of a wide range of users. Particularly, in accordance with the invention according to claim 4, by adding running data provided by a vehicle to the function of electronic media, the utilization value of the electronic media can be increased.<br>
In accordance with the inventions according to claims 5 to 8, by using an electronic information-processing apparatus such as a phone, a fax machine or a PC, it is possible to form a judgment on the state of a vehicle or other states based on information received from the vehicle even if the electronic information-processing apparatus is separated away from the vehicle. By virtue of a way of utilization in which the user is informed of a call arriving at the phone of the user, for example, it is possible to further deepen the user's feeling of intimacy with the vehicle.  In addition, in accordance with the inventions according to claims 7 and 8, a maintenance institution such as a vehicle dealer is capable of providing data such as maintenance information based on information received from the vehicle.  In addition, a pseudo creature input by a maintenance institution can be set on the vehicle.<br><br><br>
 In accordance with the inventions according to claims 9 to 13, functional components provided m the vehicle in advance can be used for expressing an intention and a feeling of the pseudo creature. The user is capable of recognizing the expressed information with a high degree of reliability.  Particularly, a light and a sound generated by the light devices and the warning device respectively can be distinguished from lights and sounds generated by external sources with ease.  Thus, the light devices and the warning device are appropriate communication means mounted on the motor-bicycle.  In addition, since behaviors of the pseudo creature are represented by the light devices and the warning device, it is possible to impress the driver that the entire vehicle and the pseudo creature are one and, hence, to further deepen the intimacy of the driver with the vehicle.<br>
In accordance with the inventions according to claims 14 to 16, it is possible to form a diversified-communication scene including users of other vehicles. Particularly, in accordance with the inventions according to claims 15 and 16, the user is capable of recognizing<br><br><br>
the position and the condition of another user. -Thus,<br>
adequate communication among users can be established<br>
with ease<br>
