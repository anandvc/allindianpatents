				<td>Process for the preparation of ubihydroqulnones and ubiquinones<br>
Ubiquinones are prenylated quinones which are present in nearly all organisms, in plants and animals including humans, and known since 1956. They are part of the inner membrane of mitochondria and bacterial membranes serving as transmitters of electrons and protons in the respiratory chain where they are reversibly transformed into corresponding hydroquinones (ubiquinols) via semiquinones.<br>
Ubiquinones, also known as coenzymes Q (CoQ), are designated according to the number of the isoprenyl units of their side chain Q-l, Q-2, Q-3, etc. (or CoQl, CoQ2, CoQ3, etc.) or according to the number of the carbon atoms of their side chain U.-5, U.-10, U.-15, etc. In Escherichia coli Q-l to Q-8 have been found, in fish Q-9 and in rat Q-l 1 and Q-l2. In most mammals including humans Q-10 is predominant and, therefore, has attracted most interest.<br>
Ubiquinones, especially the higher ones, CoQ8 to CoQ 12, and particularly CoQ 10, are widely used, e.g., in the treatment and prevention of various diseases such as heart and neurological diseases, in cosmetics and as food or dietary supplements. Ubiquinoles as part of the ubiquinone/ubiquinole redox-system are natural antioxidants.<br>
O. Isler and co-workers were the first to synthesize U.-45 (Q-9) and U.-50 (Q-10) from 5-methyl-2,3-dimethoxy-hydroquinone and solanesol (contained in tobacco leaf) or the corresponding isoprenoid compound obtained by extending solanesol by one isoprenyl unit, respectively, in diethyl ether in the presence of ZnCk as catalyst and oxidizing the resulting condensation product with Ag2O (Helv. Chim. Acta 42.2616-2621 [1959]).<br>
H. Fukawa et al. in US 3,549,668 describe the preparation of coenzymes QsÂ»-Qi2- Solanesol or isoprenyl alcohols corresponding to Qg, Qn and Qi2, extracted from Silkworm feces or<br>

CONFIRMATION COPY<br>
mulberry leaves, are condensed in the presence of ZnCh, AlCls and BF3 ether complex with 5-methyl-2,3-dimethoxy-hydroquinone or its 4-acyI derivative and the ubihydroquinones obtained were oxidized according to the methods described by Isler et al.<br>
5    S. Kijima et al. in US 4,062,879 describe the preparation of coenzyme Q compounds by reaction of 2-meihyl-4,5,6-trimethoxyphenol with boric acid or a reactive derivative thereof to form the corresponding borate which is then reacted with a prenol or isoprenol, hydrolysed and oxidized.<br>
H. Eto et al. (Chemistry Letters 1988, 1597-1600) increased the yield to 5 1% ( after 10   purification 46%) and stereoselectivity (E/Z at the 2,3-double bond of the side chain = 92:8, after purification &gt;99:1) of the condensation reaction in the presence of BF3 ether complex by using a hexane/nitromethane (1:2, v/v) mixture as solvent and a ten fold amount of isodecaprenol.<br>
E. Morita et al. POS 28 09 496) describe a method for the preparation of 2-methyI-3-1 S    prenyl-4,5 ,6-trimethoxy-phenols (wherein the prenyl chain consists of 1 - 1 0 isoprenyl units) by reacting 2,3,4-trimethoxy-6-:Tnetb.yl-phenol with a poly-prenol of formula R-C(CH3)=CH-CH2-OH or an isomer thereof of formula R-C(CH3)(OH)-CH=CH2 in the presence of a catalyst containing a Lewis acid (such as BF3 and ether complexes thereof, ZnCU, A1C13 and SnCU) and a Si02-Al2O3 compound. The prenylphenol obtained can 20    easily be oxidized to give the conesponding 1,4-quinone using a mild oxidizing agent such as AgiO, PbO:, FeCU or aqueous<br>
The syntheses so far developed still use high amounts of catalysts in the condensation reaction, viz. up to 20 mol% (in the case of BF3 ether complex; and even higher, e.g., with ZnClj approximately 300 mol%). Other catalysts should be identified which in lower 25    amounts give high yields with a high E/Z-ratio at the 2,3-double bond of the side chain thus making the technical process for the preparation of ubihydroquinones and ubiquinones more effective.<br>
In accordance with the present invention it has now been found that this is achieved by the use of other catalysts, so far not used in this condensation reaction.<br>

Preparation of CoQIO by condensation of IDP with DMDHT in heptane/nitromethane in the presence of catalyst X and subsequent oxidation.<br>
General procedure<br>
Under argon atmosphere in a 200 ml four necked flask equipped with a KPG-stirrer, thermometer, gas inlet, and a reflux condenser, 5.14 mmo] (3.59 g) of isodecaprenol (IDP) were dissolved in 75 ml of n-heptane and the solution was mixed with 25.69 mmol (4.73 g) of 3,4-dimethoxy-2,5-dihydroxytoluene (DMDHT) dissolved in 38 ml of nitromethane. 0.15 - 0.54 mmol of the catalyst, a Lewis-acid or heteropoly acid, were then added (in<br>
solid form or in solution). The two-phase mixture was heated up to 50Â°C (internal temperature) under stirring (450 rpm). After 12 hours reaction time the mixture was cooled down to room temperature (21Â°C). The heptane layer was separated and washed two times with 20 ml (total 40 ml) of nitromethane (to extract the excess of hydroquinone). The heptane phase was oxidised with 4.5 g of silver (I) oxide and 0.3 ml of glacial acetic acid for one hour at room temperature. The dark brown mixture was filtered (over Dicalite SpeedexÂ®, filter aid), washed with heptane, and evaporated under reduced pressure.<br>

In a 200 ml four necked flask equipped with a KPG-stirrer, thermometer, gas inlet, and a reflux condenser, under argon atmosphere 2.4 mmol (1.68 g) of isodecaprenol (IDP) were dissolved in 25 ml of n-heptane and mixed with 11.8 mmol (2.34 g) of 3,4,5-trimethoxy-2-hydroxytoluene (TMHT) dissolved in 13 ml of nitromethane. The catalyst, Bi(OTf)3 (0.09 mmol), was then added. The two-phase mixture was heated up to 46Â°C (internal temperature) under stirring (450 rpm). After 12 hours reaction time the mixture was cooled down to room temperature (21Â°C). The heptane layer was separated and washed two times with 10 ml (total 20 ml) of nitromethane. The heptane phase was evaporated (2.4 g crude product, yield 46.8%). Oxidation of a sample according to Example 3 (below) gave an E/Z ratio of CoQIO of 96:4.<br>

In a 100 ml flask 1.09 g (0.91 mmol) of 73.3% 2-hydroxy-3,4,5-trimethoxy-6-decaprenyl-toluene were dissolved in 4.1 ml of dichloromethane and 4.1 ml acetonitrile at 0Â°C. To this solution 2.46 g FeCU â¢ 6 HjO (9.0 mmol, commercial from Riedel de Haen) in 8.2 ml of acetonitrile were added at 0-5Â°C. After 30 minutes at 0-5Â°C, 60 ml deionised water were added and the orange emulsion after addition of 60 ml 5% aqueous NaHCO3 solution was extracted with 250 ml of ether. The water layer was extracted with 60 ml of ether. The combined ether phases were dried over NaaSC^ and concentrated at 35Â°C under reduced pressure (20 to 10 mbar). The crude product (orange oil, 1.09 g, 100 %) was analysed by HPLC to be CoQIO; E/Z-ratio 95.8:4.2.<br>

Oxidation with 1.73 g (3.12 mmol) of cerium (TV) ammonium nitrate in 8.2 ml of acetonitrile, 4.1ml of dichloromethane, and 4.1 ml of deionised water provided CoQIO in 61% yield; E/Z = 94.9: 5.1.<br>
Example 4<br>
Preparation of CoQ9 from DMDHT and solanesol<br>
In a 50 ml four necked flask equipped with a stirrer, thermometer, gas inlet, and a reflux condenser, under argon atmosphere 0.654 g (96.52 %, 1 mmol) of solanesol (nonaprenol, GIS) were dissolved in 15 ml of n-hexane. The solution was mixed with 0.983 g (5.0 mmol) of 2,3-dimethoxy-l,4-dihydroxy~toluene (DMDHT) dissolved in 7.6 ml of nitromethane, The catalyst, Sc(OTf)3 (2.5 mg, 0.005 mmol) was then added. The two-phase mixture was heated up to 50Â°C (internal temperature) under stirring (400 rpm). After 16 hours reaction time the mixture was cooled down to room temperature (21CC). The hexane layer was separated and washed two times with 4 ml (total 8 ml) of nitromethane.
