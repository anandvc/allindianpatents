If the user wants to modify further parameter, systems links to D (Fig. 4A). During sequential operation PLC (Fig. 1, #16) will fetch data from memory (Fig. 3, #25) &amp; will execute the program.<br><br><br>
(C) System Operation:<br>
The PLC (Fig. 2, #16) scans all input/outputs for actual process parameter interpretation. If the parameter matches with set values then it proceeds with sequential steps. The RTD (Fig. 3, #17) senses the hot plate temperature. Till the temperature display shows below set value, the digital I/O (Fig. 3, #26) energizes relay board (Fig. 3, #27) to keep gas solenoid (Fig. 2, #18) on. Once require temperature of hot plate (Fig. 2, #3) reaches, the system checks for home position of Spreader (Fig. 2, #7). Then system digital I/O (Fig. 3, #26) energizes relay board (Fig. 3, #27) &amp; start the hot-plate motor (Fig. 2, #4). Then the digital I/O (Fig. 3, #26) energizes relay board (Fig. 3, #27) to start water pump (Fig. 2, #15) to spray water on hot plate for set duration (T5). After completion of spraying time (T5), the digital I/O (Fig. 3, #26) energizes relay board (Fig. 3, #27) to start the scraper motor (Fig. 2, #6), which moves the scraper unit (Fig. 2, #5) forward &amp; reverts back to home position after cleaning the hot plate. Then the digital I/O (Fig. 3, #26) energizes relex board (Fig. 3, #27) to start batter pump (Fig. 2, #11) and batter suction cylinder completely fills with batter. Then the digital I/O (Fig. 3, #26) energizes relay board (Fig. 3, #27) to start spreader motor (Fig. 2, #8), which moves the spreader assembly by 45 deg. angle from its home position above the hot plate. Then the digital I/O (Fig. 3, #26) energizes relay board (Fig. 3, #27) to start thickness control unit (Fig. 2, #9). This adjusts spreader vertical position above the hot plate that subsequently set dosa thickness in "mm". Then the digital I/O (Fig. 3, #26) energizes relay board (Fig. 3, #27) to start batter pump (Fig. 2, #11) to dispense batter on hot plate. Then the digital I/O (Fig. 3, #26) energizes relay board (Fig. 3, #27) to start oil pump (Fig. 2, #13) to spray oil on dosa for set duration (T2). At the end of spreader time (T3), the digital I/O (Fig. 3, #26) energizes relay board (Fig. 3, #27) to start spreader motor (Fig. 2, #8) to lift spreader assembly upward &amp; moves back to its home position. After completion of baking time (Tl), the digital I/O (Fig. 3, #26) energizes relay board (Fig. 3, #27) to start the scraper motor (Fig. 2, #6), which moves scraper on hot plate to pick up ready dosa. The digital display (Fig. 3, #24) indicates number of dosa produced. If less then the set quantity, the system links to step F (Fig. 4 B) for continuing production of remaining number of dosas. If the set numbers of dosa are produced then the system goes to stop mode &amp; hot plate stops rotating. Then system displays process completion indication.<br><br><br>
Method of Manufacturing<br>
As a first step the basic materials such as Rice ,urad dal (black gram splits) required for producing different varieties of dosa are mixed in the requisite proportions, soaked in water , ground in grinder &amp; put in a vessel for fermentation for requisite time. The fermented batter is put inside the batter tank (10) for preparation of dosa .<br>
Switch on the machine. The programmable logic controller, PLC (16) will be on. Then set all the process parameters like hotplate temperature, dosa baking time, dosa thickness, nos. of dosa required, oil pump on time, spreader on time, scrapper on time and water pump on time in the PLC (16). Open the machine hot plate cover (2). Open the cooking gas valve to ignite the pilot flame burner (21) manually. If the hot temperature is below the set temperature, the SOV (18) opens and the main flame burner (22) ignites automatically. Then PLC display unit (24) shows the hot plate temperature. Once the hot plate temperature is reached to the set temperature, press the push button to start the sequential operation of the machine. The hotplate (3) starts rotating through motor (4) with the commands from PLC (16), a Water pump (15) connected to a water tank (14) sprays water on the hot plate(3), a scrapper unit(5) used for cleaning of hot plate(3) fitted with motor(6) moves from its home position towards center of the hot plate all most in touch condition there by takes away any foreign particle deposited on the hot plate surface, the proximity sensor (19) fixed on the side of scrapper assembly cuts off the motor ( 6) movement, and scrapper ( 5) returns back to its home position after the set time interval in PLC(16), a spreader assembly (7) fixed on the side of the hot plate ,moves around 45 degree from its home position to the center of the hot plate (3), connected to a motor (8), the proximate sensor (20) fixed on side of spreader assembly (7) cuts off the motor ( 8 ) , a batter pump (11) fixed to machine base(l) dispenses required quantity of dosa batter from batter tank(10) to the hot plate(3) , the spreader (7) spreads the batter in form of a circular thin disk, the thickness of which can be controlled by maintaining the gap (thickness) between the hot plate(3) and the spreader assembly(7) and the dosa diameter can be varied by varying the quantity of the batter addition and above gap (thickness), the spreader assembly (7) being connected to a thickness control unit (9) uses a stepper motor driven by PLC (16) to maintain the required thickness, an oil pump(13) connected to oil tank (12) fixed on machine base(l) sprays oil on pre cooked dosa<br><br><br>
or on allied products, the spreader assembly(7) moves up and goes back to its home position and the dosa baking time starts, the hot plate rotation stops during dosa backing period as per time set in the PLC(16),after the baking time the hot plate starts rotating and scrapper(5) moves from its home position towards the hot plate(3) to take out the dosa from the hot plate(3) and then goes back to its home position. The motors ( 4 ,6,8,9) and pumps(l 1,13,15) are being powered and controlled by PLC (16). The above process repeats sequentially until the number of dosa entered in the PLC system being prepared. Masala, chutney any other filling is dispensed on dosa before it is rolled in requisite shape and size, removed and served.<br>
The following table demonstrates the difference between the locally available semi automatic machine and fully automatic machine developed by us.<br><br>
NOVEL FEATURES	CFTRI DESIGNED DOSA M/C (Prior art)	M/C DEVELOPED BY Pidilite<br>
1. Control System	It is a Semi automatic machine Based on local controller and timers.	It is a fully automatic PLC based control system.<br>
2. Cleaning System.	No       CIP       (Clean       In Place)system.   Needs  manual cleaning every time.	Efficient CIP(Clean In Place) system. Machine cleans the hot plate automatically after production of individual dosa.<br>
3. Thickness.	Manual control. Hence lack of uniformity   in   thickness   of dosa.	Automatic control of thickness using stepper motor. Thickness of dosa can be adjusted at 0,1mm steps . Hence very useful to make thin and crispy dosa.<br>
4. Dosa shape.	Dosa Shape are irregular.	Always round in shape.<br><br><br><br>
5. Capacity.	Huge capacity Machine (400 dosa /hour), requires 3 phase electric power supply. Hence can  not  be  used  for  small establishment.	Small capacity machine ( 20 dosa / hr ),  requires single phase electric power supply, 1 can be used in both house hold         &amp;          commercial establishment.<br>
6.      Variation      in     batter dispensing quantity.	Dispensed     batter     quantity always varies due to change of liquid level in batter storage tank.	No variation in dispensed batter quantity since it operates by piston pump.<br>
7. Better control of wastage.	Always chances of    spillage due  to  gravity  feeding     as batter tank is   housed   above the hot plate level.	No dropping of batter from feeding nozzle as batter tank is housed below the hot plate level.<br>
8. Variation in Oil dispensing quantity.	Quantity varies due to change of oil level head in tank.	Oil is dispensed by pump for stipulated time set in the PLC.<br>
9.  Better control of baking time.	Dosa baking time depends on hot      plate      speed      and temperature. Time is set after hit and trial method.	Dosa baking time is pre-programmed in the PLC and easy to change.<br>
