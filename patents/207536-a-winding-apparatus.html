				<td>The invention relates to a winding apparatus for producing a wound lap in which the lap is wound up on a tube which is driven by a revolving endless belt which is rotatably about an axis and is arranged in a loop of the belt tensioned by a tensioning device, which loop is formed between two deflection rollers and becomes larger with the increasing lap.<br>
From the known state of the art, e.g. from DE-A1-195 39 3 65, a device is known where a wound lap is formed by using a driven and endlessly revolving belt. A lap is supplied between two deflection rollers to a loop of the belt. A rotatably held tube is disposed within the loop of the belt, which tube is driven by the movement of the belt through friction. At the beginning of the winding process the web is supplied to the zone between the circumference of the tube and an inner surface of the loop of the belt. As a result of the conveying movement of the belt the supplied lap is wound up on the tube. As a result of this process the web (as seen in the radial direction of the tube) is wound up in layers on the tube. This device can be used to form a highly compact wound lap at a very high winding speed. It is been seen, however, that the edge zones of the individual layers of the wound lap show partly projecting fibers or groups of fibers and thus the wound lap shows an uneven overall surface in the zone of its face sides. On the one hand, this leads to an unappealing appearance of the wound lap and, on the other hand,  to<br><br>
disadvantages in the subsequent processing process in the combing machine, in particular in the edge zones of the lap which is unwound there again.<br>
These disadvantages arise in particular as a result of the fact that despite a high tensioning of the belt there is a continued and partly slightly lateral to-and-fro movement of the belt during the winding process. This lateral displacement displaces the respective outermost layer by a small amount with respect to the layer of the web which is disposed below on the tube. As the edge fibre zone of the lap is subjected to this shifting movement in particular, it has a particularly disadvantageous effect. As a result, fibres from the lap layers are thus shifted and project outwardly. Additionally, this displacement can have a disadvantageous effect on the subsequent unwinding process in the combing machine when felting between the layers occur.<br>
This displacement has a particularly disadvantageous effect in the zone of the winding loop when side discs are used. This means that as a result of the lateral displacement of a layer the distance of the lap to the lateral guide discs is reduced, so that the edge zones of the lap can fold.<br>
The invention now has the object of eliminating the aforementioned disadvantages and of providing an apparatus for the formation of wound laps so as to allow the production of a wound lap with even and clean edge portions.<br><br>
This object is achieved in such a way that the belt is guided transversally to its direction of movement in a positive manner at least in the zone of the deflection rollers. This positive guidance, which ensures a stable position of the belt in the zone of the deflection rollers transversally to its conveying direction, avoids the occurrence of the lateral displacement of the individual layers from a desired positioning with respect to the tube width.<br>
It is proposed that the belt is provided on at least one side with a profiling which forms a positive-locking guidance with a profiled surface of the deflection rollers, as seen transversally to the conveying direction of the belt. This positive guidance ensures that a lateral displacement of the belt is prevented in the area of the deflection rollers.<br>
As is proposed further, this profiling, as seen in the longitudinal direction of the belt and in the circumferential direction of the deflection rollers, can have the shape of a toothed rack. This means that as a result of this profiling, as seen in the longitudinal direction of the belt, there are groove-like elevations and recesses. In order to allow the profiling of the belt and the deflection roller to mutually engage, these groove-like elevations and recesses are arranged, displaced in the axial direction, over the circumference of the deflection rollers. The shapes of the rack-shaped profile can comprise<br><br>
different geometries. It would also be possible that the belt and the deflection rollers, respectively, are provided with a profiling. As seen over the width of the belt, different profilings and geometries can be present for the profile.<br>
As a further embodiment it is proposed that the belt is provided with openings in which elevations of the deflection rollers engage in time intervals, with the elevations being arranged in the circumferential direction of the deflection rollers in such a way that at least one elevation is always in engagement during the movement of the belt. In this respect the belt can be provided with a perforation both in the edge zone and in the longitudinal direction, with the elevations engaging in the perforation which are attached on the deflection rollers. Moreover, it would also be possible that a toothed wheel each is arranged in the edge zone of the deflection rollers, which toothed wheel is torsionally rigidly fastened to the same and whose teeth engage in the openings or perforations of the belt. Such guiding means are used in the area of printers, which departs from the field of the invention, where toothed wheels are provided for the purpose of drawing in endless paper which engage in the perforations of the endless paper.<br>
It is also possible, as will be proposed below, that the belt is provided with guide elements which are distributed over its longitudinal direction and communicate in a positive locking manner with the guide elements in time<br><br>
intervals during the belt movement, which guide elements are torsionally rigidly connected with the deflection rollers.<br>
Preferably, the belt is guided over more than two deflection rollers. For the purpose of the lateral stabilization of the belt it is proposed that the belt is guided in a positive manner in at least three deflection rollers. In order to further stabilize the lateral belt guidance and to exclude any play in movable parts it is proposed that the driven tube is rotatably held about a fixed axis.<br>
The proposed attachment of drivable winding discs at the side of the belt loop in conjunction with a stably guided belt leads to a special arrangement with which the edge fibre zone can be managed or formed even better.<br>
Preferably, the attached winding discs are arranged concentrically to the tube. In order to utilize the aforementioned advantages the axial distance between the discs and the belt should not be more than 5 mm. Preferably, 1 to 2 mm can be chosen for this distance.<br><br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a winding apparatus for producing a wound lap in which the lap is wound up on a tube (H) which is driven by a revolving endless belt rotatable about an axis (A) and is arranged in a loop of the belt tensioned by a tensioning device, which loop is formed between the two deflection rollers (Rl. R2) and becomes larger with the increasing lap, characterized in that the belt is guided transversally to its direction of movement (F) in a positive manner at least in the /.one of the deflection rollers (Rl. R2).<br>
Further advantages are disclosed and described in closer detail by reference to the following description and embodiments, wherein:<br>
Fig. 1 shows a schematic representation of the basic arrangement of a winding apparatus with the same being<br><br>
represented both in the phase at the beginning of the winding process as well as in the phase at the end of the winding process;<br>
Pig. 2 shows an enlarged representation of the section B-B pursuant to fig. 1;<br>
Fig. 3 shows an enlarged representation of the detail P pursuant to fig. 2;<br>
Fig. 4 shows a further embodiment of a positive connection according to a partial representation pursuant to fig. 2;<br>
Fig. 5 shows a top view pursuant to fig. 4;<br>
Fig. 6 is a further embodiment of a positive connection pursuant to fig. 4;<br>
Fig. 7 shows a partial top view of fig. 6.<br>
Fig. 1 shows in a merely schematical representation a winding apparatus 10 for producing a wound lap 12. Principally, such winding apparatuses are used for winding up a fleece, a nonwoven or a lap from fibre material into a wound lap before the fibre material is subjected to further treatment. Thus, the winding apparatus can be used in a combing room for receiving a fleece arriving from a drafting arrangement and supplied by way of reversing plates, calender rollers and/or the like, with the produced lap then being supplied to a combing machine for combing.<br><br>
Below, for the sake of simplicity reference is made merely to a lap in connection with the supplied fibre material, which shall not be understood in any way as limiting.<br>
The winding apparatus 10 is supplied with a lap 14 by way of a lap feeder 16, which in the present case is formed by a bent plate at the delivery-sided end. Lap 14 is wound up on a tube H which acts as a core and is rotatably held about a fixed axis A. Said tube H is driven by a revolving endless belt 18, through which a loop 20 is formed between two deflection rollers Rl, R2 in which the tube H is received. In the present case the wound lap 12 is driven by the belt 18 counterclockwise, as is indicated by the arrow F. The loop 20 of belt 18 which wraps around the wound lap increases in size with the increasing wound lap 12, with the belt 18 being tensioned during the entire winding process by a tensioning device 22. This tensioning device 22 comprises a tensioning roller R4 with an associated linear guiding means 24.<br>
The belt 18 is guided over further deflection rollers R3 and R5 and the tensioning roller R4, which is adjustable along the linear guide means 24, in such a way that it is tensioned by way of the tensioning roller R4 in a plane which is parallel to the plane containing the axes of the two deflection rollers Rl, R2. The axis along which the tensioning roller R4 is adjustable is designated as X-axis in fig. 1.<br><br>
In the embodiment as represented in fig. 1 the deflection rollers Rl, R2, R3, R5, the tensioning roller R4 and the tube H all have the same diameter. The axes of the rollers and the tube are mutually parallel. The upwardly situated deflection rollers Rl, R2 are provided with a vertical distance to the other deflection rollers R5 and the tensioning roller R4 which is larger than the maximum diameter of the wound lap 12. The two deflection rollers R], R2 on the one part and the deflection roller R5 and the tensioning roller R4 on the other part are each situated with their axes in a horizontal plane. In the position of the rollers which is shown in the unbroken lines and arises at the end of the winding process in that the tensioning roller R4 assumes its left end position and the deflection roller R2 has not yet been swivelled outwardly (the deflection rollers Rl, R3, R5 are stationary), the lower left deflection roller R5 is offset to the left as compared with the upper left deflection roller R2. In its left end position as shown in fig. 1 with the unbroken line, tensioning roller R4 is offset to the right at the end of the winding process as compared with the upper deflection roller Rl, with the horizontal distance between these rollers Rl, R4 being larger than the one between the rollers R2 and R5. As a result, the rollers Rl, R2, R4 and R5 are arranged trapezoidal, with the horizontal distance between the rollers R4 and R5 being larger than the one between rollers Rl and R2. In this roller position which is shown in fig. 1 with the unbroken line, the tensioning roller R4 assumes its left end position. Starting out from this left end position of the tensioning roller R4 the<br><br>
further deflection roller R3, which is arranged above the tensioning roller, is displaced to the left by an amount which measured from roller centre to roller centre is approximately equivalent to the radius of the rollers Rl to R5 which have the same diameter. The vertical distance between the rollers R3, R4, as measured from centre to centre, corresponds to approximately the diameter of the roller. This ensures that the belt 18 wraps around the tensioning roller R4 consistently with an angle of wrap of 180°, irrespective of its position. Belt 18 is driven by a drive (not shown in closer detail) by way of the deflection roller R5 which is disposed in the plane in which the belt 18 is tensioned. The left upper deflection roller R2 is attached at the upper end of a swivelling lever 26 which at the other end is swivellably held about the axis of the left lower deflection roller R5. The leftwardly swivelled position of swivelling lever 26 is shown in fig. 1 with the dot-dash line in which the fully wound lap 12 is ejected.<br>
The tube H which is rotatable about the fixed axis A and the two deflection rollers Rl, R2 are dimensioned in such a way and are mutually arranged in the rightwardly swivelled position of the swivelling arm 26, which is the working position, in such a way that the loop 20 which is formed by the belt 18 between the deflection rollers Rl, R2 wraps around the tube H with an initially minimal angle of wrap at the beginning of the winding process, which angle is larger than 180°. This course of loop 20 at the beginning of the winding process is represented in fig. 1 by dotted lines. In this phase the tensioning roller R4 assumes its<br><br>
right end position. During the winding process the angle of wrap increases with which loop 20 wraps around the tube. The tensioning roller R4 is displaced to the left until it has reached the left end position shown in the unbroken line after the wound lap 12 is completed.<br>
The tensioning device 22 is coupled with a preferably electronic control device 28 for the production of a tensioning force which is dependent on the diameter of the wound lap. In the embodiment as shown in fig. 1 a sensor 3 0 is provided which immediately detects the diameter of the wound lap and supplies a respective signal S to the control device 28.<br>
Tube H is favourably clamped between two winding discs 32, 34 (fig. 2) which can be laterally removed in the direction of the indicated arrows. The winding discs 32, 34 are provided with noses 36, 38 on which the tube can be inserted.<br>
As is shown in fig. 2, the deflection roller Rl is provided on its circumference with a groove-like profile 44 which with the teeth 13 of the one-sided profiling 9 of the belt 18 assumes a positive-locking connection transversally to the belt conveying direction in the zone of the deflection. The illustrated representations of fig. 2 and fig. 3 show the deflection roller Rl in an uncut view. The profile 9 of the belt 18 shown in a sectional view is provided with a toothed-rack-like arrangement in the cross section. Figs. 2 and 3 show the three outer layers of the lap 14 by way of<br><br>
an example. Their width extends on either side by the amount a over the width of the deflection roller Ri, with both coming to rest on the face side 3 9 of the winding disc 32 and 33, respectively.<br>
During the winding process the web 14 is condensed, as a result of which it can only expand in its width until it comes to rest on the face side 39. This slight expansion by the amount a is a desired effect, since thus there is a certain condensation and smoothing of the edge zone of the web 14 in cooperation with the winding discs 32, 33. As a result of the proposed positive connection between the deflection roller Rl and the belt 18 it is ensured that the amount a retains a constant value. Without this lateral guidance there would be undesirable compressions in the edge zone during the lateral drift of the belt, which would partly lead to the detachment of fibres in this zone. A plurality of geometrical designs is possible in the choice of the profile. It would also be possible to provide such a profiling merely in the edge zone of the belt or the deflection roller. The profiling can thus extend evenly or unevenly to both sides of the central axis MA.<br>
Fig. 4 shows a further embodiment, with the belt being provided in the edge zone with successively arranged openings 34 in which teeth 3 5 can engage. The teeth are distributed over the circumference of the deflection roller Rl according to distance b. This device also allows guiding the belt laterally in a stable manner in the zone of the<br><br>
deflection roller. Different geometrical solutions are possible in this case too.<br>
Fig. 6 shows a further embodiment, with a chain 49 being fastened to the belt by way of holding means 52. The holding means 52 are attached to the belt by way of fastening means 53 (such as rivets) and are attached to the link chain 49 by way of bridge 51. The chain links 50 are fastened to the bridges 51 at a predetermined distance. A toothed wheel is fixedly attached on the outer side coaxially to the deflection roller Rl. The teeth 47 of said wheel can engage in the individual chain links 50 for the purpose of lateral fixing. This device also laterally guides belt 18 in the zone of the deflection roller Rl. The other deflection rollers R2, R3, R5 can be provided with such devices in order to guide the belt during the deflection in a positive-locking way transversally to the conveying direction.<br>
Lap 14 is introduced by way of the lap feed 16 and a guide element 40 into the loop 20 in the zone 42 between the deflection rollers Rl, R2. During the winding process the diameter of the wound lap 12 increases until it reaches a respective size, which is reported by the sensor 30 of the control device 28. It then initiates the ejection mechanism, with the deflection roller R2 pivoting downwardly via the swivelling lever 2 6 and releasing the wound lap for ejection. For the release of the wound lap 12 the winding discs 32 and 33 are displaced outwardly, as a result of which the wound lap can be removed from the<br><br>
winding position. Thereafter a new tube is inserted into the winding pocket 20 once the deflection roller R2 is swivelled back to its winding position. The tube is then clamped by driving together the winding discs 32 and 33, so that the system is ready again for the formation of a new lap. Further details on the formation of a lap can be taken from the published DE-195 39 365, for example.<br><br><br>
