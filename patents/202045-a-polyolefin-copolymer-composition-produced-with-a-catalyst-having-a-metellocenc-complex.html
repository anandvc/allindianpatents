				<td>POLYOLEFIN COMPOSITION WITH MOLECULAR WEIGHT MAXIMUM<br>
OCCURRING IN THAT PART OF THE COMPOSITION THAT HAS THE<br>
HIGHEST COMONOMER CONTENT<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to polyolefin copolymer compositions with the molecular weight maximum occurring in that part of the composition that has the highest comonomer content, and, preferably, with long chain branching, which have been produced from an a-olefin monomer and one or more a olefin comonomers in a single reactor with a single metallocene catalyst  and to processes for the production of these materials and the catalysts used therefor.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Recently there have been many advances in the production of polyolefin copolymers due to the introduction of metallocene catalysts.  Metallocene catalysts offer the advantage of generally higher activity than traditional Ziegler catalysts and are usually described as catalysts which are single-site in nature.  Because of their single-site nature the polyolefin copolymers produced by metallocene catalysts often are quite uniform in their molecular structure.  For example, in comparison to traditional Ziegler produced materials, they have relatively narrow molecular weight distributions (MWD) and narrow Short Chain Branching Distribution (SCBD).  By narrow SCBD  it is meant that the frequency of short chain branches, formed where comonomers incorporate into the polyolefin chain, is relatively independent of molecular weight. Although certain properties of metallocene products are enhanced by narrow MWD, difficulties are often encountered in the processing of these materials into useful articles and films relative to Ziegler produced materials.  In addition, the uniform nature of the SCBD of metallocene produced materials does not readily permit certain structures to be obtained.<br>
An approach to improving processability has been the inclusion of long chain branching (LCB), which is particularly desirable from the viewpoint of improving processability without damaging advantageous properties.  U.S. Patent No.'s 5,272,236; 5,278,272;<br><br>
5,380,810; and EP 559,773, EP 676,421, WO 94/07930 relate to the production of polyolefins with long chain branching.<br>
Another approach is the addition of the polymer processing aids to the polymer prior to fabrication into films or articles.  This requires extra processing and is expensive.<br>
A different approach to the problem has been to make compositions which are blends or mixtures of individual polymeric materials with the goal being to maximize the beneficial properties while minimizing the processing problems.  This requires extra processing which increases the cost of materials produced.  U.S. Patent No.'s 4,598,128; 4,547,551; 5,408,004; 5,382,630; 5,382,631; and 5,326,602; and WO 94/22948 and WO 95/25141 relate to blends.<br>
Another way to provide a solution for the processability problems and to vary SCBD has been the development of various cascade processes, where the material is produced by a series of polymerizations under different reactor conditions, such as in a series of reactors.  Essentially, a material similar in some ways to a blend is produced, with a modality greater than one for various physical properties, such as the molecular weight distribution. While polyolefin compositions with superior processability characteristics can be produced this way, these methods are expensive and complicated relative to the use of a single reactor.  Processes of interest are disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 5,442,018, WO 95/26990, WO 95/07942 and WO 95/10548.<br>
Another potentially feasible approach to improving processability and varying SCBD has been to use a multicomponent catalyst.  In some cases, a catalyst which has a metallocene catalyst and a conventional Ziegler-Natta catalyst on the same support to produce a multimodal material, in other cases two metallocene catalysts have been used in polyolefin polymerizations.  Components of different molecular weights and compositions are produced in a single reactor operating under a single set of polymerization conditions.  This approach is difficult from the point of view of process control and catalyst preparation.  Catalyst systems of interest are disclosed in WO 95/11264 and EP 676,418.<br><br>

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
It would be desirable to be able to produce a polyolefin copolymer composition which has the molecular weight maximum occurring in that portion of the composition that has the highest number of short chain branches and which is very easy to process. Further, it would be desirable to be able to accomplish this using a single metallocene catalyst, preferably supported in a polymerization process using a single reactor, preferably gas phase, operating semi-continuously or, preferably, continuously under a single set of reactor conditions.  It would be especially desirable to be able to produce a polyolefin copolymer composition which has the molecular weight maximum occurring in that portion of the composition that has the highest number of short chain branches and which has significant long chain branching.<br>
The short chain branching distribution of a polyolefin composition, which is due to the incorporation of an a-olefin comonomer during the polymerization of an a-olefin monomer, can be examined by several techniques, such as, for example, ATREF-DV and GPC-FTIR.  If the material of the composition is divided into portions starting at one end of the distribution or the other, the relationship between high short chain branching content due to high comonomer content and molecular weight can be determined.<br>

The activating technique of bulk electrolysis involves the electrochemical oxidation of the metal complex under electrolysis conditions in the presence of a supporting electrolyte comprising a noncoordinating, inert anion.  In the technique, solvents, supporting electrolytes and electrolytic potentials for the electrolysis are used such that electrolysis byproducts that would render the metal<br><br>
complex catalytically inactive are not substantially formed during the reaction.  More particularly, suitable solvents are materials that are: liquids under the conditions of the electrolysis (generally temperatures from 0Â°C to 100Â°C), capable of dissolving the supporting electrolyte, and inert.  "Inert solvents" are those that are not reduced or oxidized under the reaction conditions employed for the electrolysis.  It is generally possible in view of the desired electrolysis reaction to choose a solvent and a supporting electrolyte that are unaffected by the electrical potential used for the desired electrolysis.  Preferred solvents include difluorobenzene (all isomers), DME, and mixtures thereof.<br>
The electrolysis may be conducted in a standard electrolytic cell containing an anode and cathode (also referred to as the working electrode and counter electrode respectively).  Suitable materials of construction for the cell are glass, plastic, ceramic and glass coated metal.  The electrodes are prepared from inert conductive materials, by which are meant conductive materials that are unaffected by the reaction mixture or reaction conditions.  Platinum or palladium are preferred inert conductive materials.  Normally, an ion permeable membrane such as a fine glass frit separates the cell into separate compartments, the working electrode compartment and counter electrode compartment.  The working electrode is immersed in a reaction medium comprising the metal complex to be activated, solvent, supporting electrolyte, and any other materials desired for moderating the electrolysis or stabilizing the resulting complex. The counter electrode is immersed in a mixture of the solvent and supporting electrolyte.  The desired voltage may be determined by theoretical calculations or experimentally by sweeping the cell using a reference electrode such as a silver electrode immersed in the cell electrolyte.  The background cell current, the current draw in the absence of the desired electrolysis, is also determined.  The electrolysis is completed when the current drops from the desired level to the background level.  In this manner, complete conversion of the initial metal complex can be easily detected.<br>
Suitable supporting electrolytes are salts comprising a cation and an inert, compatible, noncoordinating anion, A~.  Preferred supporting electrolytes are salts corresponding to the formula:<br>
wherein:<br><br>
G"*" is a cation which is nonreactive towards the starting and resulting complex; and<br>
A~ is a noncoordinating, compatible anion.<br>
Examples of cations, G"^, include tetrahydrocarbyl substituted ammonium or phosphonium cations having up to 40 nonhydrogen atoms.  A preferred cation is the tetra-n-butylammonium cation.<br>
During activation of the complexes of the present invention by bulk electrolysis the cation of the supporting electrolyte passes to the counter electrode and A~ migrates to the working electrode to become the anion of the resulting oxidized product.  Either the solvent or the cation of the supporting electrolyte is reduced at the counter electrode in equal molar quantity with the amount of oxidized metal complex formed at the working electrode.<br>
Preferred supporting electrolytes are tetrahydrocarbylammonium salts of tetrakis(perfluoroaryl) borates having from 1 to 10 carbons in each hydrocarbyl group, especially tetra-n-butylammonium tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl) borate.<br>
The molar ratio of catalyst/cocatalyst employed preferably ranges from 1:10,000 to 100:1, more preferably from 1:5000 to 10:1, most preferably from 1:10 to 10:1.<br>
In general, the catalysts can be prepared by combining the two components (metal complex and activator) in a suitable solvent at a temperature within the range from about "100Â°C to about 300Â°C.  The catalyst may be separately prepared prior to use by combining the respective components or prepared in situ  by combination in the presence of the monomers to be polymerized.<br>
It is understood with suitable functionality on the catalyst or cocatalyst the catalyst system can be covalently or ionically attached to the support material.<br>
Preferred supports for use in the present invention include highly porous silicas, aluminas, aluminosilicates, and mixtures thereof.  The most preferred support material is silica.  The support material may be in granular, agglomerated, pelletized, or any other physical form.  Suitable materials include, but are not limited to, silicas available from Grace Davison (division of W.R. Grace &amp; Co.) under the designations SD 3216.30, Davison Syloid 245, Davison 948 and Davison 952, and from Crossfield under the designation ES70, and from Degussa AG under the designation Aerosil 812; and aluminas<br><br>
available from Akzo Chemicals Inc. under the designation Ketzen Grade B.<br>
Supports suitable for the present invention preferably have a surface area as determined by nitrogen porosiraetry using the B.E.T. method from 10 to about 1000 m^/g, and preferably from about 100 to 600 m^/g.  The pore volume of the support, as determined by nitrogen adsorption, advantageously is between 0.1 and 3 cm^/g, preferably from about 0.2 to 2 cm^/g.  The average particle size depends upon the process employed, but typically is from 0.5 to 500 \im,   preferably from 1 to 100 ^m.<br>
Both silica and alumina are known' to inherently possess small quantities of hydroxyl functionality.  VJhen used as a support herein, these materials are preferably subjected to a heat treatment and/or chemical treatment to reduce the hydroxyl content thereof.  Typical heat treatments are carried out at a temperature from 3 0Â°C to 1000Â°C (preferably 250Â°C to 800Â°C for 5 hours or greater) for a duration of 10 minutes to 50 hours in an inert atmosphere or under reduced pressure.  Typical chemical treatments include contacting with Lewis acid alkylating agents such as trihydrocarbyl aluminum compounds, trihydrocarbylchlorosilane compounds, trihydrocarbylalkoxysilane compounds or similar agents.  Residual hydroxyl groups are then removed via chemical treatment.<br>
The support may be functionalized with a silane or chlorosilane functionalizing agent to attach thereto pendant silane -(Si-R)=, or chlorosilane -{Si-Cl)= functionality, wherein R is a Ci-io hydrocarbyl group.  Suitable functionalizing agents are compounds that react with surface hydroxyl groups of the support or react with the silicon or alumin\im of the matrix.  Examples of suitable functionalizing agents include phenylsilane, hexamethyldisilazane diphenylsilane, methylphenylsilane, dimethylsilane, diethylsilane, dichlorosilane, and dichlorodimethylsilane.  Techniques for forming such functionalized silica or alumina compounds were previously disclosed in U.S. Patents 3,687,920 and 3,879,368, the teachings of which are herein incorporated by reference.<br>
The support may also be treated with an aluminum component selected from an alumoxane or an aluminum compound of the formula AlR^x'R^y/ wherein R-^ independently each occurrence is hydride or R, R2 is hydride, R or OR, x' is 2 or 3, y' is 0 or 1 and the sum of x' and y' is 3.  Examples of suitable R^ and R^ groups include methyl, methoxy, ethyl, ethoxy, propyl {all isomers), propoxy (all isomers).<br><br>
butyl (all isomers), butoxy {all isomers), phenyl, phenoxy, benzyl, and benzyloxy.  Preferably, the aluminum component is selected from the group consisting of aluminoxanes and tri(Ci-4 hydrocarbyl)aluminum compounds.  Most preferred aluminum components are aluminoxanes, trimethylaluminum, triethyl luminum, tri-isobutyl luminum, and mixtures thereof.<br>
Alumoxanes (also referred to as aluminoxanes) are oligomeric or polymeric aluminum oxy compounds containing chains of alternating aluminum and oxygen atoms, whereby the aluminum carries a substituent, preferably an alkyl group.  The structure of alumoxane is believed to be represented by the following general formulae (-A1 (R)-0)j^-, for a cyclic alumoxane, and R2Al-0{-Al (R)-O) jj,--AIR2 , for a linear compound, wherein R is as previously defined, and m' is an integer ranging from 1 to about 50, preferably at least about 4. Alumoxanes are typically the reaction products of water and an aluminum alkyl, which in addition to an alkyl group may contain halide or alkoxide groups.  Reacting several different aluminum alkyl compounds, such as for example trimethyl aluminum and tri-isobutyl aluminum, with water yields so-called modified or mixed alumoxanes. Preferred alumoxanes are methylalumoxane and methylalumoxane modified with minor amounts of C2-4 alkyl groups, especially isobutyl. Alumoxanes generally contain minor to substantial amounts of starting aluminum alkyl compound.<br>
Particular techniques for the preparation of alumoxane type compounds by contacting an aluminum alkyl compound with an inorganic salt containing water of crystallization are disclosed in U.S. 4,542,119.  In a particular preferred embodiment an aluminum alkyl compound is contacted with a regeneratable water-containing substance such as hydrated alumina, silica or other substance.  This is disclosed in EP-A-338,044.  Thus the alumoxane may be incorporated into the support by reaction of a hydrated alumina or silica material, which has optionally been functionalized with silane, siloxane, hydrocarbyloxysilane, or chlorosilane groups, with a tri (Ci-10 alkyl) al\iminum compound according to known techniques.  For the teachings contained therein the foregoing patents and publications, or there corresponding equivalent United States applications, are hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
The treatment of the support material in order to also include optional alumoxane or trialkylaluminum loadings involves contacting the same before, after or simultaneously with addition of the complex or activated catalyst hereunder with the alumoxane or<br><br>
trialkylaluminum compound, especially triethylaluminum or triisobutylaluminum.  Optionally the mixture can also be heated under an inert atmosphere for a period and at a temperature sufficient to fix the alumoxane, trialkylaluminum compound, complex or catalyst system to the support.  Optionally, the treated support component containing alumoxane or the trialkylaluminum compound may be subjected to one or more wash steps to remove alumoxane or trialkylaluminum not fixed to the support.<br>
Besides contacting the support with alumoxane the alumoxane may be generated in  situ  by contacting an unhydrolyzed silica or alumina or a moistened silica or alumina with a trialkyl aluminum compound optionally in the presence of an inert diluent.  Such a process is well known in the art, having been disclosed in EP-A-250,600;   U.S.-A-4,912,075; and U.S.-A-5,008,228; the teachings of which, or of the corresponding U.S. application, are hereby incorporated by reference.

These aliominum compounds are usefully employed for their beneficial ability to scavenge impurities such as oxygen, water, and aldehydes from the polymerization mixture.  Preferred aluminum compounds include C2_6 trialkyl aluminum compounds, especially those wherein the alkyl groups are ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, isobutyl, pentyl, neopentyl, or isopentyl, and methylalumoxane,<br><br>

It is understood that the present invention is operable in the absence of any component which has not been specifically disclosed.  The following examples are provided in order to further illustrate the invention and are not to be construed as limiting.  Unless stated to the contrary, all parts and percentages are expressed on a weight basis.<br>

For polymerizations wherein propene is the monomer, the preferred comonomers are the same as that immediately previous, but with the inclusion of ethylene instead of propene.<br>
Long chain macromolecular a-olefins can be vinyl terminated polymeric remnants formed in  situ  during continuous solution polymerization reactions.  Under suitable processing conditions such long chain macromolecular units may be polymerized into the polymer product along with ethylene and other short chain olefin monomers to give small quantities of long chain branching in the resulting polymer.<br>
In general, the polymerization may be accomplished at conditions well known in the prior art for Ziegler-Natta or Kaminsky-Sinn type polymerization reactions.  Suspension, solution, slurry, gas phase or high pressure, whether employed in batch or continuous form or other process conditions, may be employed if desired. Examples of such well known polymerization processes are depicted in WO 88/02009, U.S. Patent Nos. 5,084,534; 5,405,922; 4,588,790; 5,032,652; 4,543,399; 4,564,647; 4,522,987, which are incorporated herein by reference; and elsewhere.  Preferred polymerization temperatures are from 0-250Â°C.  Preferred polymerization pressures are from atmospheric to 3000 atmospheres.<br>
Preferably, the processes of this invention are performed in a<br>
single reactor, which may have a single reaction vessel or two or<br>
more vessels producing essentially the same polyolefin copolymer<br>
composition.  Thus, the polymerization processes of this invention do<br>
not produce blends, or where i	'-'	'"     ' ' on vessel is used do<br><br>
not require blending to produce essentially homogeneous polyolefin copolymer compositions.<br>
In rTiOSt polymerization reactions the molar ratio of f       catalyst â€¢.polyrr.erizable compounds employed is from 10~12.3_ ^^ 10"^ :1, more preferably from 10~-^2.]_ ^Q   10'"^ :1.<br>

Mixtures of the foregoing are also suitable.<br>
One such polymerization process comprises: contacting, optionally in a solvent, one or more a-olefins with a catalyst in one or more continuous stirred tank or tubular reactors.  U.S. Patent No.'s 5,272,236 and 5,278,272 related to olefin polymerizations in solution and are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
The process of the present invention can be employed to advantage in the gas phase copolymerization of olefins.  Gas phase processes for the polymerization of olefins, especially the homopolymerization and copolymerization of ethylene and propylene, and the copolymerization of ethylene with higher a-olefins such as, for example, 1-butene, 1-hexene, 4-methyl-1-pentene are well known in the art.  Such processes are used commercially on a large scale for the manufacture of high density polyethylene (HDPE), medium density polyethylene (MDPE), linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE) and polypropylene.<br><br>
The gas phase process employed can be, for example, of the type which employs a mechanically stirred bed or a gas fluidized bed as the polymerization reaction zone.  Preferred is the process wherein the polymerization reaction is carried out in a vertical cylindrical polymerization reactor containing a fluidized bed of polymer particles supported above a perforated plate, the fluidisation grid, by a flow of fluidisation gas.<br>
The gas employed to fluidize the bed comprises the monomer or monomers to be polymerized, and also serves as a heat exchange medium to remove the heat of reaction from the bed.  The hot gases emerge from the top of the reactor, normally via a tranquilization zone, also known as a velocity reduction zone, having a wider diameter than the fluidized bed and wherein fine particles entrained in the gas stream have an opportunity to gravitate back into the bed.  It can also be advantageous to use a cyclone to remove ultra-fine particles from the hot gas stream.  The gas is then normally recycled to the bed by means of a blower or compressor and a one or more heat exchangers to strip the gas of the heat of polymerization.<br>
Â»<br>
A preferred method of cooling of the bed, in addition to the cooling provided by the cooled the recycle gas, is to feed a volatile liquid to the bed to provide an evaporative cooling effect.  The volatile liquid employed in this case can be, for example, a volatile inert liquid, for example, a saturated hydrocarbon having about 3 to about 8, preferably 4 to 6, carbon atoms.  In the case that the monomer or comonomer itself is a volatile liquid, or can be condensed to provide such a liquid, this can be suitably be fed to the bed to provide an evaporative cooling effect.  Examples of olefin monomers which can be employed in this manner are olefins containing about three to about eight, preferably three to six carbon atoms.  The volatile liquid evaporates in the hot fluidized bed to form gas which mixes with the fluidizing gas.  If the volatile liquid is a monomer or comonomer, it will undergo some polymerization in the bed.  The evaporated liquid then emerges from the reactor as part of the hot recycle gas, and enters the compression/heat exchange part of the recycle loop.  The recycle gas is cooled in the heat exchanger and, if the temperature to which the gas is cooled is below the dew point, liquid will precipitate from the gas.  This liquid is desirably recycled continuously to the fluidized bed.  It is possible to recycle the precipitated liquid to the bed as liquid droplets carried 1   in the recycle gas stream.  This type of process is described, for example in EP 89691; U.S. 4,543,399; WO 94/25495 and U.S. 5,352,749,<br><br>
which are hereby incorporated by reference.  A particularly preferred method of recycling the liquid to the bed is to separate the liquid from the recycle gas stream and to reinject this liquid directly into the bed, preferably using a method which generates fine droplets of the liquid within the bed.  This- type of process is described in BP Chemicals' WO 94/28032, which is hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
The polymerization reaction occurring in the gas fluidized bed is catalyzed by the continuous or semi-continuous addition of catalyst.  Such catalyst can be supported on an inorganic or organic support material as described above.  The catalyst can also be subjected to a prepolymerization step, for example, by polymerizing a small quantity of olefin monomer in a liquid inert diluent, to provide a catalyst composite comprising catalyst particles embedded in olefin polymer particles.<br>
The polymer is produced directly in the fluidized bed by catalyzed copolymerization of the monomer and one or more comonomers on the fluidized particles of catalyst, supported catalyst or prepolymer within the bed.  Start-up of the polymerization reaction is achieved using a bed of preformed polymer particles, which are preferably similar to the target polyolefin, and conditioning the bed by drying with inert gas or nitrogen prior to introducing the catalyst, the monomers and any other gases which it is desired to have in the recycle gas stream, such as a diluent gas, hydrogen chain transfer agent, or an inert condensable gas when operating in gas phase condensing mode.  The produced polymer is discharged continuously or discontinuously from the fluidized bed as desired.<br>
The gas phase processes suitable for the practice of this invention are preferably continuous processes which provide for the continuous supply of reactants to the reaction zone of the reactor and the removal of products from the reaction zone of the reactor, thereby providing a steady-state environment on the macro scale in the reaction zone of the reactor.<br>
Typically, the fluidized bed of the gas phase process is operated at temperatures greater than 50Â°C, preferably from about 60Â°C to about 110Â°C, more preferably from about 70Â°C to about 110Â°C.<br>
Typically the molar ratio of comonomer to monomer used in the polymerization depends upon the desired density for the composition being produced and is about 0.5 or less. Desirably, when producing materials with a density range of from about 0.91 to about 0.93 the<br><br>
comonomer to monomer ratio is less than 0.2, preferably less than 0.05, even more preferably less than 0.02, and may even be less than 0.01.  Typically, the ratio of hydrogen to monomer is less than about 0.5, preferably less than 0.2, more preferably less than 0.05, even more preferably less than 0.02 and may even be less than 0.01.<br>
The above-described ranges of process variables are appropriate for the gas phase process of this invention and may be suitable for other processes adaptable to the practice of this invention.<br>
A number of patents and patent applications describe gas phase processes which are adaptable for use in the process of this invention, particularly, U.S. Patents 4,588,790; 4,543,399; 5,352,749; 5,436,304; 5,405,922; 5,462,999; 5,461,123; 5,453,471; 5,032,562; 5,028,670; 5,473,028; 5,106,804; and EP applications 659,773; 692,500; and PCT Applications WO 94/29032, WO 94/25497, WO 94/25495, WO 94/28032; WO 95/13305; WO 94/26793; and WO 95/07942 all of which are hereby incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Desirably, the polyolefin copolymer composition of this invention contains in polymerized form from 0.01 to 99.99 mole percent ethylene as the monomer and from 99.99 to 0.01 mole percent of one or more olefin comonomers.  More desirably, the composition contains in polymerized form from 0.1 to 99.9 mole percent ethylene as the monomer and from 99.9 to 0.1 mole percent of one or more olefin comonomers.  Preferably, the composition contains in polymerized form from 50 to 99.9 mole percent ethylene as the monomer and from 50 to 0.1 mole percent of one or more olefin comonomers.  A highly preferred embodiment is that where the composition contains in polymerized form from 96 to 99.9 mole percent ethylene as the monomer and from 4 to 0.1 mole percent of one or more olefin comonomers.<br>
Generally, it is desirable that the density of the composition be from about 0.87 to about 0.96, although it may be higher or lower than this range.  More highly desirably, the density is from about 0.90 to about 0.94, and preferably from 0.910 to about 0.925.  The composition desirably has a melt index I2 of from about 0.01 to about 150, and an I2i/l2 which is equal to or greater than 24, and a Mw/Mn of from about 2.0 to about 10.<br><br>
A preferred polyolefin copolymer composition is that wherein the composition has an I21/I2 which is equal to or greater than 24 and a Mw/Mn of from about 2.0 to about 3.5.<br>
A preferred polyolefin copolymer composition is that wherein the composition has a short chain branching distribution that is multimodal, or wherein the composition has a molecular weight distribution that is multimodal.<br>
Another preferred polyolefin copolymer composition of is that wherein the density of the composition is from about 0.910 to about 0.925, the comonomer to monomer molar ratio is less than 0.02, the hydrogen to monomer ratio is less than 0.C2, and the composition is produced in a reactor with a reaction zone having a temperature of 70Â°C or higher.<br>
The homogeneity of the polymers is typically described by the SCBDI (Short Chain Branch Distribution Index) or CDBI (Composition Distribution Branch Index) and is defined as the weight percent of the polymer molecules having a comonomer content within 50 percent of the median total molar comonomer content.  The SCBDI of a polymer is readily calculated from data obtained from techniques known in the art, such as, for example, temperature rising elution fractionation (abbreviated herein as "TREF") as described, for example, in Wild et al. Journal of Polymer Science, Poly. Phys. Ed., Vol. 20, p. 441 (1982), in U.S. Patent 4,798,081 (Hazlitt et al.), or in U.S. Patent 5,089,321 (Chiim et al.) the disclosures of all of which are incorporated herein by reference.  The SCBDI or CDBI for the homogeneous linear and for the substantially linear ethylene/a-olefin polymers used in the present invention is preferably greater than 50 percent.<br>
For the polyolefin polymer compositions of this invention, the long chain branch is longer than the short chain branch that results from the incorporation of one or more a-olefin comonomers into the polymer backbone.  The empirical effect of the presence of long chain branching in the copolymers of this invention is manifested as enhanced rheological properties wnich are indicated by higher flow activation energies, and greater I21/I2 than expected from the other structural properties of the compositions.<br><br>
Measurement of comonomer content vs log molecular weight by GPC/FTIR<br>
The comonomer content as a function of molecular weight was measured by coupling a Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (FTIR) to a Waters 150Â°C Gel Permeation Chromatograph (GPC). The setting up, calibration and operation of this system together with the method for data treatment has been described previously (L.J. Rose et al, "Characterisation of Polyethylene Copolymers by Coupled GPC/FTIR" in "Characterisation of Copolymers", Rapra Technology, Shawbury UK, 1995, ISBN 1-85957-048-86.)  In order to characterize the degree to which the comonomer is concentrated in the high molecular weight part of the polymer, the GPC/FTIR was used to calculate a parameter named comonomer partition factor, Cpf.  Mn and Mw were also determined using standard techniques from the GPC data.<br>
Comonomer Partitioning Factor  (GPC-FTIR)<br>
The comonomer partitioning factor Cpf is calculated from<br>
GPC/FTIR data.  It characterizes the ratio of the average comonomer<br>
content of the higher molecular weight fractions to the average<br>
comonomer content of the lower molecular weight fractions.  Higher<br>
and lower molecular weight are defined as being above or below the<br>
median molecular weight respectively, that is, the molecular weight<br>
distribution is divided into two parts of equal weight.  Cpf is<br>
calculated from the following equation:<br>
n<br>
i=l	<br>
1=1<br>
m<br>
Cpf = ;=i    ,where: c^ is the mole fraction comonomer content and w^ m<br>
7=1<br>
is the normalized weight fraction as determined by GPC/FTIR for the n FTIR data points above the median molecular weight.  Cj is the mole fraction comonomer content and w-j is the normalized weight fraction as determined by GPC/FTIR for the m FTIR data points below the median molecular weight.  Only those weight fractions, w^  or wj which have associated mole fraction comonomer content values are used to calculate Cpf.  For a valid calculation, it is required that n and m are greater than or equal to 3.  FTIR data corresponding to molecular weight fractions below 5,000 are not included in the calculation due to the uncertainties present in such data.<br><br>
For the polyolefin copolymer compositions of this invention, Cpf desirably is equal to or greater than 1.10, more desirably is equal to or greater than 1.15, even more desirably is equal to or greater than 1.20, preferably is equal to or greater than 1.30, more preferably is equal to or greater than 1.40, even more preferably is equal to or greater than 1.50, and still more preferably is equal to or greater than 1.60.<br>
ATREF-DV<br>
ATREF-DV has been described in U.S. Patent No. 4,798,081, which is hereby incorporated by reference, and in "Determination of Short-Chain Branching Distributions of Ethylene copolymers by Automated Analytical Temperature Rising Elution Fractionation" (Auto-ATREF), J. of Appl Pol Sci: Applied Polymer Symposium 45, 25-37 (1990) . ATREF-DV is a dual detector analytical system that is capable of fractionating semi-crystalline polymers like Linear Low Density Polyethylene (LLDPE) as a function of crystallization temperature while simultaneously estimating the molecular weight of the fractions.  With regard to the fractionation,  ATREF-DV is analogous to Temperature Rising Elution Fractionation (TREF) analysis that have been published in the open literature over the past 15 years.  The primary difference is that this Analytical - TREF (ATREF) technique is done on a small scale and fractions are not actually isolated. Instead, a typical liquid chromatographic (LC) mass detector, such as an infrared single frequency detector, is used to quantify the crystallinity distribution as a function of elution temperature. This distribution can then be transformed to any number of alternative domains such as short branching frequency, comonomer distribution, or possibly density.  Thus, this transformed distribution can then be interpreted according to some structural variable like comonomer content, although routine use of ATREF for comparisons of various LLDPE's is often done directly in the elution temperature domain.<br>
To obtain ATREF-DV data, a commercially available viscometer especially adapted for LC analysis, such as a Viskotekâ„¢ is coupled with the IR mass detector.  Together these two LC detectors can be used to calculate the intrinsic viscosity of the ATREF-DV eluant. The viscosity average molecular weight of a given fraction can then be estimated using appropriate Mark Houwink constants, the corresponding intrinsic viscosity, and suitable coefficients to estimate the fractions concentration (dl/g) as it passes through the detectors.  Thus, a typical ATREF-DV report will provide the weight<br><br>
fraction polymer and viscosity average molecular weight as a function of elution temperature.  Mpf is then calculated using the equation given.<br>
Molecular Weight Partitioning Factor<br>
The molecular weight partitioning factor Mpf is calculated from TREF/DV data.  It characterizes the ratio of the average molecular weight of the fractions with high comonomer content to the average molecular weight of the fractions with low comonomer content.  Higher and lower comonomer content are defined as being below or above the median elution temperature of the TREF concentration plot respectively, that is, the TREF data is divided into two parts of equal weight.  Mpf is calculated from the following equation:<br><br>
I	w,-	Mi<br>
i=	1	<br>
	n	<br>
	Iw;<br>
'	â– =1	<br>
m		<br>
1	Wj	â– Mj<br>
7=1		<br>
4pf = j=\	,where: M-i_ is the viscosity average molecular weight and<br>
m 7=1<br>
V!j_   is the normalized weight fraction as determined by ATREF-DV for the n data points in the fractions below the median elution temperature. M^ is the viscosity average molecular weight and w-j is the normalized weight fraction as determined by ATREF-DV for the m data points in the fractions above the median elution temperature. Only those weight fractions, Wj_ or w-; which have associated viscosity average molecular weights greater than zero are used to calculate Mpf.  For a valid calculation, it is required that n and m are greater than or equal to 3.<br>
For the polyolefin copolymer compositions of this invention, Mpf desirably is equal to or greater than 1.15, more desirably is equal to or greater than 1.30, even more desirably is equal to or greater than 1.40, preferably is equal to or greater than 1.50, more preferably is equal to or greater than 1.60, even more preferably is equal to or greater than 1.70.<br>
Activation Energy as an Indicator of Long Chain Branching<br>
The significance and determination of the activation energy of flow, which represents the temperature dependence of the viscosity, has been described extensively (J. M. Dealy and K. F. Wissbrun, "Melt Rheology and its Role in Plastics Processing", Van Nostrand Reinhold, New York (1990)).  For polyolefins, the Arrhenius equation is generally used to describe the temperature dependence of viscosity<br><br>
since T &gt; Tg + 100 (that is, the melt temperature (T) is greater than the glass transition temperature (Tg) + 100; if this inequality is not true the V,"illiams-Landel-Ferry or WLF equation is used to describe the temperature dependence of the viscosity).  It has also been well established that long chain branched polymers have higher activation energies tihan comparable linear polymers.  These comparisons have been shown for homopolymer polyethylene, in which the activation energy for the linear homopolymer is about 6.5 kcal/mol as compared to about 12 to 14 kcal/mql for long chain branched polymers produced by the high pressure, free radical process.  When using an activation energy technique as an indicator of long chain branching, one must be careful to take into account sources of extraneous effects such as crosslinking, comonomer content effects, or i.-rpurities such as cocatalyst residue.<br>
For polyolefin copolymers, taking into account the effects described in the preceding paragraph, a value for the activation energy of about 8 kcal/mol or more in combination with greater I21/I2 than expected from the other structural properties of the compositions can be indicative of the presence of long chain branching, and especially a value for the activation energy of about 10 kcal/mol or more, in combination with greater I21/I2 than expected from the other structural properties of the compositions, definitely indicates the presence of long chain branching.  The preferred polyolefin copolymer compositions of one embodiment of this invention desirably have at least about 0.01 long chain branches per 1000 carbon atoms along the polymer backbone, more desirably from about 0.01 to about 8 long chain branches per 1000 carbon atoms along the polymer backbone, preferably from about 0.01 to about 3 long chain branches per 1000 carbon atoms along the polymer backbone, more preferably from about 0.01 to about 1 long chain branches per 1000 carbon atoms along the polymer backbone, and still more preferably from about 0.02 to about 0.5 long chain branches per 1000 carbon atoms along the polymer backbone.  It should be understood that, when long chain branching is measured by some experimental techniques, such as NMR, the units for the aforementioned ranges of values for the number of long chain branches are per 1000 total carbon atoms.<br>
The ten5&gt;erattire dependence of the viscosity for polyethylenes can be expressed in terms of an Arrhenius equation, in which the activation energy can be related to a shift factor, arp, used to determine a mastercurve for the material by time-temperature superposition.  The values of the shift factor arp are independent of<br><br>
molecular weight and molecular weight distribution (W. W. Graessley, "Viscoelasticity and Flow in Polymer Melts and Concentrated Solutions", in J. E. Mark et al., Ed., "Physical Properties of Polymers", 2""^ Ed., ACS, New York (1993); J. Wang and R. S. Porter, "On The Viscosity-Temperature Behavior of Polymer Melts", Rheol. Acta, 34, 496 (1995); R. S. Porter, J. P. Knox, and J. F. Johnson, "On the Flow and Activation Energy of Branched Polyethylene Melts", Trans. Soc. Rheol., 12, 409 (1968).), and thus the activation energy is independent of molecular weight and molecular weight distribution for polymers that obey an Arrhenius relationship between shift factors and inverse temperature.  Others (V. R. Raju et al., "Properties of Amorphous and Crystallizable Hydrocarbon Polymers. IV.  Melt Rheology of Linear and Star-Branched Hydrogenated Polybutadiene", J. Polym. Sci., Polym. Phys. Ed., 17, 1223 (1979).) have shown that the high activation energies (10 - 18 kcal/mol) of long chain branched polybutadienes as compared to that of linear polyethylene (6.4 kcal/mol) are related to long-chain branching. Variation of the activation energy among long chain branched samples was concluded to be due to variations in average branch lengths.<br>
Determination of Activation Energy Stabilization of Samples<br>
If samples were received unstabilized, the samples were stabilized with the following stabilization package:  1250 ppm calcium stearate, 500 ppm Irganox 1076, and 800 ppm PEPQ.  This stabilization package was dissolved in acetone, which was then gently poured over the sample.  The sample was then placed in a vacuum oven and dried at a temperature of 50-60Â°C until the sample was dry (approximately one day).<br>
Molding of Samples<br>
All samples were compression molded with a Tetrahedron MTP-8 Hot Press before rheological testing.  A tray was used to contain the samples and to transfer the sample in and out of the press.  A metal plate was placed on the tray, and a Mylar sheet was placed on top of the brass plate.  The sample shims used were of approximately 2-3 mil thickness and slightly greater than 1 inch diameter in the form of a circle/disk.  These shims were filled with sample, with up to 8 shims being used per molding.  If many disks were required for a given sample, a 3 inch diameter shim was used.  Another piece of Mylar was then placed over the top of the sample and over this was placed a metal plate.  The tray with samples was then placed between the tetrahedron plates, which were at ^^0Â°^   TV,O T=.-=hedron plates are<br><br>
then brought together for 5 minutes with a force of 1500 pounds.  The tray was then removed from the press and allowed to cool.  An arc punch of 25 ram diameter was then used to cut the samples for rheological testing.<br>
Rheological Testing<br>
Rheological testing was performed on a Rheoraetrics RMS-800 with 25 mm diameter parallel plates in the dynamic mode.  Before performing the flow activation energy experiments, two strain sweep experiments were performed to determine the percent strain to perform the activation energy experiments so that the testing would be performed in the linear viscoelastic region and the torque signals would be significant.  One strain sweep experiment was performed at the highest test temperature (210Â°C) at a low frequency (0.1 rad/s) to determine the minimum percent strain necessary to generate a significant torque signal.  The second strain sweep was performed at the lowest temperature (170Â°C) at the highest frequency (100 rad/s) to determine the maximum percent strain allowable to remain within the linear viscoelastic region.  In general, the percent strain ranged from 10 - 30 percent depending upon the molecular weight/stiffness of the sample.<br>
The activation energies were determined by performing a frequency sweep from 100 to 0.01 rad/s with five points per decade at 210, 190, and 170Â°C with a percent strain as determined above.  A separate 25 mm disk or plaque of material was used for each experiment.  The rheological data were analyzed with the Rheometrics RHIOS 4.4 software.  The following conditions were selected for the time-temperature superposition (t-T) and the determination of the flow activation energies [Ea)   according to an Arrhenius equation, a^f. = exp(Ea/RT) ,   which relates the shift factor (ay ) to  E   {R  is the gas constant, and T is the absolute temperature):<br>
Shift method:	2D<br>
Shift accuracy:	high<br>
Interpolation:	spline<br>
all at 190Â° C reference temperature.<br>
The polyolefin copolymer compositions of a preferred embodiment of this invention desirably have a flow activation energy of at least about 8 kcal/mol, more desirably of at least about 10 kcal/mol.<br><br>
V<br>
preferably of at least about 12 kcal/mol and more preferably of at least about 15 kcal/mol.<br>
The polyolefin copolymer compositions of this invention may be blended with a wide variety of other resins to achieve a desirable balance of physical properties, or for economic reasons.  Generally, the physical properties of the blends are what would be expected from a weighted interpolation of the physical properties of the individual components, with the greatest deviations from linearity being seen when one of the blend components is small relative to the other.<br>
Desirably, the blends of this invention comprise two or more resin components, (A) and (B), where the blend comprises from about 1 weight percent to about 99 weight percent of (A) and from about 99 weight percent to about 1 weight percent of one or more resins that are different from the (A) component.  The (A) component may be any of the polyolefin copolymer compositions of this invention, while the (B) component may be any other resin which is not incompatible with component (A).  Preferred (B) components are various polyolefins.<br>
In one embodiment, where it is desirable that the (B) component predominate, the blend comprises from about 1 weight percent to about 30 weight percent of (A), and from about 99 weight percent to about 70 weight percent of (B) one or more resins that are different from the (A) component.  If a greater disparity in the amounts of the components is desired, the blend comprises from about 1 weight percent to about 15 weight percent of (A) and from about 99 weight percent to about 85 weight percent of (B) one or more resins that are different from the (A) component.<br>
In an alternative embodiment, where it is desirable that the (A) component predominate, the blend comprises from about 99 weight percent to about 70 weight percent of (A) , and from about 1 weight percent to about 3 0 weight percent of (B) one or more resins that are different from the (A) component.  If a greater disparity in the amounts of the con^jonents is desired, the blend comprises from about 99 weight percent to about 85 weight percent of (A), and from about 1 weight percent to about 15 weight percent of (B) one or more resins that are different from the (A) component.<br><br>

Comparative B is Exxon Exceedâ„¢ 401, a commercially available gas phase produced polyethylene produced by Exxon Chemical using a metallocene catalyst.  (Note:  A second sample of this material was evaluated, and a value for E^ of 7.53 kcal/mol was determined, as well as a value for I21 of 77.92 and Iio of 27.02, and, thus, a value of I21/I2 of 17.3 and I10/I2 of 6.0.  In addition, the critical shear rate at the onset of surface melt fracture was 294 s~^  at a shear stress of 2.15 x 10^ dyn/cm^ and the critical shear rate at the onset of gross melt fracture was 795 s"^ at a shear stress of 3.45 x 10^ dyn/cm^. This data indicates the absence of long chain branching.) Comparative C is Novapolâ„¢ TD902, a commercially available gas phase produced polyethylene produced by Novascorâ„¢ using a traditional Ziegler-Natta catalyst.<br>
Comparative D is DOWLEX''*' 2056A, a commercially available solution process polyethylene produced by The Dow Chemical Company using a traditional Ziegler-Natta catalyst.<br>

Comparative F is enhanced polyethylene XU-59900.00, a commercially available solution process polyethylene produced by The Dow Chemical Company.<br>
The improved processability observed for the compositions of Examples 2a (see note 5 below) and 3 are due to the presence of long chain branching in the polymer.  DOWLEXâ„¢ 2056A, produced by the solution process using Ziegler-Natta catalyst, contains no long chain branching.  The presence of long chain branching results in higher melt strength which was measured by a Goettfert Rheotens apparatus. The data is reported in Table 3.<br><br>

The polyolefin copolymer compositions of this invention have mechanical properties, such as dart impact strength, optical properties and heat sealing properties which are superior to conventional Ziegler produced compositions of comparable density. They also have processability characteristics, as measured, for example, by melt strength and melt flow ratio, which are superior to conventional metallocene products of comparable density and melt index, and in especially preferred embodiments, to conventional Ziegler materials as well.  The polyolefin copolymer compositions also offer the advantage that they can be manufactured using a single catalyst in a single reactor process.  In the preferred embodiment, the materials of the invention can be extruded through conventional polyethylene extruders with lower power requirements, lower extruder pressures, and lower melt temperatures then conventional Ziegler-Natta and conventional metallocene products.<br>

Blending LDPE into the substantially linear low density polymer of this invention gave improvements in processability relative to the unblended polyolefin copolymer composition of this invention due to the increase in amounts of long chain branching, and as demonstrated by a reduction in extruder amps and pressure.  Data related to processability are shown in Table 6.  The blends also provide significant improvements in optical characteristics, as shown by a reduction in haze and an increase in both clarity and gloss relative to the unblended polyolefin copolymer composition of this invention, which is evident from the data in Table 7.<br>

For films made with the blends there was a noted improvement in heat seal initiation temperature, as indicated by a reduction in temperature required to obtain a 2 pound Heat Seal, and in the final Seal Strength in pounds, relative to the unblended polyolefin copolymer composition of this invention.  Data related to this aspect of Heat Seal and Seal Strength are presented in Table 8.<br>

As levels of the homopolymer LDPE resin were increased, an accompanying decrease in film strength, or mechanical properties, relative to the unblended polyolefin copolymer composition of this invention, was observed as the linear nature of the blend was decreased.  Reductions in the mechanical properties are shown in Table 10 below.<br>
Blending the polyolefin copolymer composition of this invention into a LDPE homopolymer gave improvements in the resulting film physical properties such as Ultimate Tensile Strength, Dart Impact Resistance, Elmendorf Tear, and Hot Tack Strength, relative to the unblended LDPE.<br><br>
Hot Tack Strength is the strength, in Newtons, required to pull apart two films in a partially molten condition.  This test is used to simulate the ability of a package to hold its seal, and not spill the contents, while the heat seal has not yet cooled.  As the polyolefin copolymer composition of this invention was blended into the LDPE, the hot tack strength increased as did the temperature range in which the hot tack was observed.  The data are presented in Table 9.<br>
Table 9.  Hot Tack<br>

MD Elmendorf tear, being relatively low for the polyolefin copolymer compositions of this invention, was relatively unaffected by the addition of LDPE.  The orientation effect did vary the CD tear.  The dart impact for the polyolefin copolymer compositions of this invention is quite high, and only slightly affected at moderate levels of blending with LDPE.  Data for these film physical properties are given in Table 10.<br>

Thus, it is clear that, while the high strength of the polyolefin copolymer compositions of this invention were compromised to some degree by blending with an LDPE homopolymer, other properties may be advantageously affected.  Similarly, while some properties of an unblended LDPE homopolymer may be adversely affected by blending with the polyolefin copolymer composition of this invention, the strength of the blend is superior to unblended LDPE.<br><br><br>
