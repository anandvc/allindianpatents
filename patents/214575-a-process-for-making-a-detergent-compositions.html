				<td>The present invention relates to a process for making a detergent composition.<br>
There is a trend amongst commercially available granular detergents towards higher bulk densities. This gives benefits both for consumer convenience and for reduction of packaging materials.<br>
Many of the prior art attempts to move in this direction have met with problems of poor solubility properties arising from low fate of dissolution or the formation of gels. A consequence of this in a typical washing process can be poor dispensing of the product, either from the dispensing drawer of a washing machine. or from a dosing device placed with the laundry inside the machine. This poor dispensing is often caused by gelling of particles which have high levels of surfactant upon contact with water. The gel prevents a proportion of the detergent powder from being solubilised in the wash water which reduces the effectiveness of the powder. Another adverse consequence arises even if the powder is well dispensed and dispersed in the washing water if it does not dissolve rapidly. The wash cycle has a limited duration during which the detergent can act upon the laundry. If the cleaning action is delayed because the powder is slow to dissolve, this, too, will limit the effectiveness of the powder.<br>
The process engineer and formulator have frequently found that the need for good dispensing and the need for good dissolution rate have placed conflicting demands upon them. The solution has generally been to find a compromise which gives adequate dispensing and adequate<br>
dissolution rate. For example, poor dispensing of  high bulk density granular detergents is often associated with surfactant rich particles having a high specific surface area, either due to high porosity or a small particle size (especially "fines"). However, decreasing the porosity and/or increasing the average particle size cause the dissolution rate to decrease.<br>
W094/05761, published on 17th March 1994, describes a final product donuifIcution step wherein nubrjtantially all of the product is sprayed with nonionic surfactant and coated with zeolite. Good d.iopenaing and dissolving properties are claimed.<br>
However it has now been found that even further improvements in dispensing and dissolving properties can be achieved if the nonionic surfactant and zeolite coating is applied only to selected parts of the detergent composition, rather than to the detergent composition as a whole.<br>
The object of the invention is to provide an improved process for making a detergent composition comprising anionic surfactant, nonionic surfactant and non-surfactant additives.<br>
According to the present invention there is provided a process for making a detergent composition comprising anionic surfactant, non-ionic surfactant and non-surfactant additives such as hereinbefore described the process being characterized by the steps of:<br>
(a)	mixing together at least two non-surfactant additives to<br>
form a premix;<br>
(b)	spraying of the non-ionic surfactant on to the premix,<br>
wherein the ratio of non-ionic surfactant to premix is at<br>
least 1:25;<br>
(c)	applying finely divided particulate aluminosilicate, such as<br>
herein  before  described  wherein  the  ratio  of  the<br>
aluminosilicate to non-ionic surfactant applied in step (b)<br>
is less than 1:1;<br>
(d)	increasing the mean particle size of the premix in the range<br>
of 800 to 1200 micrometers by mixing;<br>
(e)	applying finely divided particulate aluminosilicate, wherein<br>
aluminosilicate to non-ionic surfactant applied in step (b)<br>
is  greater than 1:1, to form a first intermediate particle,<br>
wherein the first intermediate particle has a mean particle<br>
size of from  900 to 1100 micrometers, and the particle size<br>
distribution has a standard deviation of less than 50<br>
micrometers; and<br>
(f)	subsequently mixing the first intermediate particle with a<br>
second    intermediate  particle  to  obtain  detergent<br>
composition,  wherein the second intermediate particle<br>
comprises of the anionic surfactant;<br>
and wherein ratio of non-ionic surfactant to anionic<br>
surfactant  is 1.3:1 to 4.5:1.<br>

Useful aluminosilicate ion exchange materials are commercially available. These aluminosilicates can be crystalline or amorphous in structure and can be naturally-occurring aluminoailicates or synthetically derived. A method for producing aluminosilicate ion exchange materials is disclosed in US-A-3 985 669, Krummel ot al, iotsued October 12, 1976. Preferred synthetic crystalline aluminosilicate ion exchange materials useful herein are available under the designations zeolite A, zeolite P(B), zeolite MAP/ zeolite X and zeolite Y. In an especially preferred embodiment, the crystalline aluminosilicate ion exchange material has the formula :<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein x is from about 20 to about 30, especially about 27. Thlo material la known as zeolite A Dehydrated zeolites (x=0-10), and "overdried" zeolites (x=10-20) may also be used herein. The "overdried" zeolites are particularly useful .when a low moisture environment is required, for example to improve stability of detergent bleachea ouch aa perborate and percarbonate. Preferably, the aluminosilicate has a particle size of about 0.1-10 micrometers in diameter. Preferred ion exchange materials have a particle size diameter of from about 0.2 micrometers to about 4 micrometers.  The term "particle size diameter" herein represents the average particle size diameter by weight of a given ion exchange material as determined by conventional analytical techniques such as, for example, microacopic determination utilizing a scanning electron microscope.  The crystalline zeolite A materials herein are usually further characterised by their calcium ion exchange capacity, which is at least about 200 mg equivalent of CaCO3 water hardness/g of aluminosilicate, calculated on an anhydroxis basis, and which generally is in the range of from about 300 mg eq./g to about 352 mg eq./g.

While any rionionic surfactant)may be usefully employed in the present invention, two families of nonionics have been found to be particularly useful. These are nonionic surfuctanto based on alkoxylated (especially ethoxylated) alcohols, and those nonionic surfactants based on amidation products of fatty acid esters and N-alkyl polyhydroxy umine. The amidation products of the eotera and the amines are generally referred to herein as polyhydroxy fatty acid amides. Particularly useful in the present invention are mixtures comprising two or more nonionic surfactants wherein at least one nonionic surfactant is selected from each of the groups of alkoxylated alcohols and the olyhydroxy fatty acid amides.<br>
Suitable rionionic surfactants include compoxmds produced by the condensation of alkylene oxide groups (hydrophilic in nature) with an organic hydrophobia compound, which may be aliphatic or alkyl aromatic in nature.  The length of the polyoxyalkylene group which is condensed with any particular hydrophobia group can be readily adjusted Uo<br>
yield a water-soluble compound having the desired degree of balance between hydrophilic and hydrophobia elements.<br>
Particularly preferred for use in the precient invention are nonionic surfactants such as the polyethylene oxide condensateu of alkyl phenols, e.g., the condensation products of alkyl phenols having an alkyl group containing from about 6 to 16 carbon atoms, in either a straight chain or branched chain configuration, with from about 4 to 25 moles of ethylene oxide per mole of alkyl phenol.<br>
Preferred nonionics are the water-soluble condensation products of aliphatic alcohols containing from 8 to 22 carbon atoms, in either straight chain or branched configuration, with an average of up to 25 moles of ethylene oxide per more of alcohol.  Particularly preferred are the condenuut.1on productn of alcohols having an alkyl group containing from about 9 to 15 carbon atoms with from about 2 to 10 moles of ethylene oxide pel" mole of alcohol; and condensation products of propylene glycol with ethylene oxide. Most preferred are condensation products of alcohols having an alkyl group containing from about 12 to 15 carbon atoms with an average of about 3 moles of ethylene oxide per mole of alcohol.<br>
It is a particularly preferred embodiment of the present invention that the nonionic surfactant system also includes a polyhydroxy fatty acid amide component.<br>
Polyhydroxy fatty acid amides may be produced by reacting a fatty acid ester and an N-alkyl polyhydroxy amine. The preferred amiria for uoo in tha preaetit invention is N- (Rl) • CH2(CH20H)4-CH2-OH, where Rl is typically a alkyl, e.g. methyl group; and the preferred ester is a C12-C20 fatty acid methyl ester.<br>
Methods of manufacturing polyhydroxy fatty acid amides have been described in WO 92 6073, published on 16th April, 1992. This application describes the preparation of polyhydroxy fatty acid amides in the presence of solvents. In u highly preterred embodiment of the Invention N-mathyl glucamine is reacted with a C12-C20 methyl ester.<br>
Other nondonic surfactants which may be used as components of the surfactant systems herein include ethoxylated nonionic surfactants, glycerol ethers, glucosamides, glycerol amides, glycerol esters, fatty acids, fatty acid eaters, fatty amides, alkyl polyglucosides, alkyl polyglycol ethers, polyethylene glycols, ethoxylated alkyl phenols and mixtures thereof.<br>
The second intermediate particle o£ the prosent invention comprises anionic surfactant. The second intermediate particle may be made by any process including apray drying, flaking, prilling, extruding, pastillating, and agglomeration. Agglomeration processes for making anionic surfactant particles have been disclosed in the prior art in, for example, EP-A-0 508 543, EP-A-0 510 746, EP-A-0 618 289 and EP-A-0 653 439. An essential feature of the invention is that no nonionic surfactant is sprayed on to the surfactant agglomerate stream.<br>
Non-limiting examples of anionic_surfastants useful herein include the conventional C11-C18 alkyl benzene aulfonates ("LAS") and primary, branched-chain and random C10-C20 alkyl sulfates ("AS"), the C10-C18 secondary (2,3) alkyl sulfates of the formula CH3 (CH2)X (CHOS03-M+) CH3 and CH3 (CH2)y(CHOSO3-M+) CH2 CH3 where x and (y+1) are integers of at least about 7, preferably at least about 9, and M is a<br>
water-solubilizing cation, especially sodium, unsaturated sulfates such as oleyl sulfate, the C10-C18 alkyl alkoxy sulfates ("AEXS", especially EO 1-7 ethoxy sulfateg), C10-C1B alkyl alkoxy oarboxylatau (especial1y the EO 1-5 ethoxycarboxylates), the C10-C18 glycerol ethers, the C10-C18 alkyl polyglycosidea and their corresponding aulfated polyglycosides, the C12-C18 alpha-sulforiated fatty acid esters, methyl eater eulphonate and oleoyl sarcosinate.<br>
