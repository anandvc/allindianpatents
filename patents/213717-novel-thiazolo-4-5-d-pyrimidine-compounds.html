COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10]<br>
"NOVEL THIAZOLO[4,5-D]PYRIMIDINE COMPOUNDS"<br>
AstraZeneca UK Limited,  a British company,  of  15  Stanhope  Gate, London, W1Y 6LN, United Kingdom,<br><br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br><br>
The present invention relates to certain thiazolopyrimidinone compounds, processes and intermediates used in their preparation, pharmaceutical compositions containing them and their use in therapy.<br>
WO 98/08847 and EP0778277 each disclose a series of 6,5-hetero bicyclic compounds said to be useful as CRF antagonists.<br>
Chemokines play an important role in immune and inflammatory responses in various diseases and disorders, including asthma and allergic diseases, as well as autoimmune pathologies such as rheumatoid arthritis and atherosclerosis. These small secreted molecules are a growing superfamily of 8-14 kDa proteins characterised by a conserved four cysteine motif. The chemokine superfamily can be divided into two main groups-exhibiting characteristic structural motifs, the Cys-X-Cys (C-X-C) and Cys-Cys (C-C) families. These are distinguished on the basis of a single amino acid insertion between the NH-proximal pair of cysteine residues and sequence similarity.<br>
The C-X-C chemokines include several potent chemoattractants and activators of neutrophils such as interleukin-8 (IL-8) and neutrophil-activating peptide 2 (NAP-2).<br>
The C-C chemokines include potent chemoattractants of monocytes and lymphocytes but not neutrophils such as human monocyte chemotactic proteins 1-3 (MCP-1, MCP-2 and MCP-3), RANTES (Regulated on Activation, Normal T Expressed and Secreted), eotaxin and the macrophage inflammatory proteins lα and 1β (MIP-lα and M3P-1β).<br>
Studies have demonstrated that the actions of the chemokines are mediated by subfamilies of G protein-coupled receptors, among which are the receptors designated CCR1, CCR2, CCR2A, CCR2B, CCR3, CCR4, CCR5, CCR6, CCR7, CCR8, CCR9, CCR10, CXCR1, CXCR2, CXCR3, CXCR4 and CX3CR1. These receptors represent good targets for drug development since agents which modulate these receptors would be useful in the treatment of disorders and diseases such as those mentioned above.<br><br>
In accordance with the present invention,, mere is therefore provided a compound of formula (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or solvate thereof:<br><br>

Preferably the compounds of the invention are administered orally.<br>
The invention will now be further illustrated by reference to the following examples. In the examples the Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectra were measured on a Varian Unity Inova 300 or 400 MHz spectrometer and the Mass Spectrometry (MS) spectra measured on a Finnigan Mat SSQ7000 or Micromass Platform spectrometer. Where necessary, the reactions were performed under an inert atmosphere of either nitrogen or argon. Chromatography was generally performed using Matrex Silica 60   (35-70 micron) or Prolabo Silica gel 60   (35-70 micron) suitable for flash silica gel chromatography. High pressure liquid chromatography purification was performed using either a Waters Micromass LCZ with a Waters 600 pump controller, Waters 2487 detector and Gilson FC024 fraction collector or a Waters Delta Prep 4000. The abbreviations m.p. and DMSO used in the examples stand for melting point and dimethyl sulphoxide respectivel<br><br>

Pyridine (6.3ml) was added and the solution cooled to 5°C. Bromine (2.2ml) was added slowly and the reaction mixture stirred for 2 hours at 5-10°C.

Pharmacological Data<br>
Ligand Binding Assay<br>
[I25I]IL-8 (human, recombinant) was purchased from Amersham, U.K. with a specific activity of 2,000Ci/mmol. All other chemicals were of analytical grade. High levels of hrCXCR2 were expressed in HEK 293 cells (human embryo kidney 293 cells ECACC No. 85120602) (Lee et al. (1992; J. Biol. Chem, 267 ppl6283-l6291). hrCXCR2 cDNA was amplified and cloned from human neutrophil mRNA. The DNA was cloned into PCRScript (Stratagene) and clones were identified using DNA. The coding sequence was sub-cloned into the eukaryotic expression vector RcCMV (Invitrogen). Plasmid DNA was prepared using Quiagen Megaprep 2500 and transfected into HEK 293 cells using Lipofectamine reagent (Gibco BRL). Cells of the highest expressing clone were harvested in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.2%(w/v) ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) and centrifuged (200g, 5min.). The cell pellet was resuspended in ice cold homogenisation buffer [l0mM HEPES (pH 7.4), ImM dithiothreitol, ImM EDTA and a panel of protease inhibitors (ImM phenyl methyl sulphonyl fluoride, 2μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 3mM benzamidine, 0.5μg/ml leupeptin and l00 μg/ml bacitracin)] and the cells left to swell for 10 minutes. The cell preparation was disrupted using a hand held glass mortar/PTFE pestle homogeniser and cell membranes harvested by centrifiigation (45 minutes, 100,000g, 4°C). The membrane preparation was stored at -70°C in homogenisation buffer supplemented with Tyrode'ssalt solution (137mMNaCl, 2.7mMKC1, 0.4mMNaH2P04), 0.1%(w/v) gelatin and 10%(v/v) glycerol.<br><br>
All assays were performed in a 96-well MultiScreen 0.45μm filtration plates (Millipore, U.K.). Each assay contained ~50pM [125 I] IL-8 and membranes (equivalent to -200,000 cells) in assay buffer [Tyrode's salt solution supplemented with l0mM HEPES (pH 7.4), 1.8mM CaCl2, ImM MgCl2, 0.125mg/ml bacitracin and 0. l%(w/v) gelatin]. In addition, a compound of formula (I) according to the Examples was pre-dissolved in DMSO and added to reach a final concentration of 1 %(v/v) DMSO. The assay was initiated with the addition of membranes and after 1.5 hours at room temperature the membranes were harvested by filtration using a Millipore MultiScreen vacuum manifold and washed twice with assay buffer (without bacitracin). The backing plate was removed from the MultiScreen plate assembly, the filters dried at room temperature, punched out and then counted on a Cobra y-counter.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) according to the Examples were found to have IC50 values of less than (
Intracellular Calcium Mobilisation Assay<br>
Human neutrophils were prepared from EDTA-treated peripheral blood, as previously described (Baly et al. (1997) Methods in Enzymology 287 pp70-72), in storage buffer [Tyrode's salt solution (137mM NaCl, 2.7mM KCl, 0.4mM NaH2P04) supplemented with 5.7mM glucose and l0mM HEPES (pH 7.4)].<br>
The chemokine GROά (human, recombinant).was purchased from R&amp;D Systems (Abingdon, U.K.). All other chemicals were of analytical grade. Changes in intracellular free calcium were measured fluorometrically by loading neutrophils with the calcium sensitive fluorescent dye, fluo-3, as described previously (Merritt et al. (1990) Biochem. J. 269, pp513-519). Cells were loaded for 1 hour at 37°C in loading buffer (storage buffer with 0.1%(w/v) gelatin) containing 5μM fluo-3 AM ester, washed with loading buffer and then resuspended in Tyrode's salt solution supplemented with 5.7mM glucose, 0.1%(w/v) bovine serum albumin (BSA), 1.8rnM CaCl2 and ImM MgCl2. The cells were pipetted into black walled, clear bottom, 96 well micro plates (Costar, Boston, U.S.A.) and centrifuged (200g, 5 minutes, room temperature).<br>
A compound of formula (I) according to the Examples was pre-dissolved in DMSO and added to a final concentration of 0.1%(v/v) DMSO. Assays were initiated by the addition of an A50 concentration of GROa and the transient increase in fluo-3 fluorescence (λEx.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
