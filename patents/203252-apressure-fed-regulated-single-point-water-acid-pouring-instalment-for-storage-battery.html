				<td>The  present  invention  relates  to a  pressure  fed  valve<br>
regulated  single  point  water/acid  pouring installation and   self<br>
protection system for lead acid flooded energy storage cells/battery/battery bank. It has an in-built type electrically operated auto feed cut-out system and self-protection devices against charging of battery during water hunting of cells, against over temperature of electrolyte in cells, over charging, over/under watering, and other major problems.<br>
In known types of storage cells or batteries due to technical reasons, each and every cell of flooded lead acid energy storage cell/battery of deep-discharge application has to be topped up with demineralised water at regular intervals, to make up for the loss of water that takes place during operation, particularly during charging. It is normally done manually. Regular water level checking and topping-up to each and every cell manually is a tedious and time consuming job, particularly when number of cells in a battery/battery bank is large. It is the moist usual cause of failure of lead acid battery in deep discharge cycle application. Apart from tedious and time-consuming factor, there is every chance of human error/failure/fatigue, whereby a cell or some cells may be left not topped up with deminerslised water or even if all the cells are topped up with water, human operation will not be able to maintain the electrolyte levels of all cells, correct/identical or prevent over topping up, all of which are badly injurious to health of energy storage cells/battery/battery bank.<br><br>
In a known single point water pouring system, there are lot of technical limitations and cost is also very high for which it has not been popularised.<br>
The following disadvantages experienced in the known battery filling system (SPWS):<br>
i. System functions only if the water is poured under very limited range of gravity pressure- In case water pressure is more than the narrow permissible limit, water/electrolyte over-flows from cells and/or damages the cell and floor. If pressure is below the minimum limit, the water will not flow in to the cell or take long time to fill the cell. Water pump cannot be used for topping—up the cells quickly.<br>
ii.   There  are no  repairing scope  of  the  high-cost valves.<br>
iii. Due to molding, mechanical and assembling complicacy, the cost of the valves and relevant SPWS are very high. Due to high cost factor, the use of these valve-base SPWS is only in high valued batteries and cannot be used in low cost batteries.<br>
-3-<br><br>
i v . In case of large number of cells base battery bank, water pouring takes too long a time, water topping up within short time is not possible.<br>
v.   No repairing scope of the Valves.<br>
To eliminate the above problems of normal water topping up to each and every cell, additions of just the required quantity of demineralised water to maintain correct electrolyte level and to automatically stop water pouring as soon as the pre-set level is achieved, it has been the endeavour of the applicant to produce a low cost, dependable and repairable single point watering system (SPWS) with auto-feed cut out system and in-built battery's self-protection system. With installation of such developed SPWS with battery's self-protection device in any battery/battery bank, the major outcome will be as under.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide with ease the water topping up job to any number cell base battery within S to 10 minutes time (upto correct level) just by a single man power. This process eliminates about 95% labour time.<br>
A further object of the present invention is to provide a better service life of all such high volume battery and shai1 reach closer to design cycle life.<br>
A still further object of the present invention is to provide less maintenance fault/error.<br><br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide easy water topping up scope accompanied with battery's self protection devices at nominal cost.<br>
A still another object of the present invention is to provide petro-fuel/pollution—free battery powered model electric bus/3— wheelers using such battery and thereby making the invention user friendly and pollution free. According to the present invention the system consists of the following elements:<br>
Single Point Watering System (SPWS) which comprises<br>

The new pressure fed valve regulated single point water/acid pouring system as described herein further comprises an in-built type float-cum equalizing charger provided with fraction and stationery battery set for preserving the life of the battery.<br>
Application Areas<br>
The application or use of the innovated equipment/system covers a wide range of electrical energy storage batteries for battery powered electric vehicles, (In-plant and on-road model) miscellaneous stationary applications, railway applications, marine / naval application, etc. where number of cells in the battery/battery bank is large and manual water pouring is problematic and ineffective. The innovated equipment/system can<br>
- 7 -<br><br>
ensures maintenance and commissioning reliability of storage battery and protect costly battery from human error related problems, namely water/acid pouring into the cells, both at the time of commissioning and daily/routine maintenance - The new system has increased the service life of battery considerably, minimize maintanenace/man power dependency and ultimately and ultimately reduces the effective cost of lead acid battery. Pollution/petro—fuel free battery powered electric vehicle for mass transportation will be rapidly popularise .<br>
(a)	For battery powered pollution free electric bus,  3-wheeler<br>
etc. and hi-brid electric vehicle, the batteries are designed and<br>
tested  as per IS:13514 or IS;5154 or any International  Standard<br>
for equivalent application batteries. Electric vehicle makers and<br>
transport  Operators/Organisations,  Government   Establishments,<br>
etc. are user of the products-<br>
(b)	For battery powered electric fork-lifter, pallet truck, tow<br>
truck,   etc,   in-plant   material   hsndling   equipment.   The<br>
batteries/cells  cover under IS:5154 and  International  standard<br>
Major industries/Work-shops, steel plants, etc. major  production<br>
units are the application field for the products.<br>
In the above areas of spplication number of cells in battery/battery set are excessive (between 24 to 180 nos per unit/set).  Further  as  per application   requirement   of   the<br>
-8-<br><br>
segment the batteries very often sustain deep-discharge and require full charge just within few hours time." For the required compactness of cells of this batteries in this application area, water space/level in the batteries/cells is very less and require frequent water pouring/topping-up. Such regular water pouring job in so hugh number of cells during evening/night hours (when the vehicle is not in service to the batteries are very much problematic and very often some cells of battery sustain water hunting relevant damages due to human error. Such improper/erratic water leveling of cells is the main reason of premature failure of batteries. The innovated system will solve the problem very economically with top reliabi1ity.<br>
(c) In power-plants, telephone exchange, power utility segment, industries, steel-plants, etc. application area where stationary lead acid batteries are bulk volume, i.e. the cell/battery bank cover in IS:1651, 1652,6304 and equivalent/respective BIS/DEAN Standard and similar specification batteries used worldwide.<br>
(d) Lead acid type storage cell base battery bank set required an Railway. Marine/Naval application.<br>
(e) Conventional stationary battery bank as used in UPS or stand—by power source or at bulk electrical energy storage and distribution system (battery storage power system).<br>
	 q 	<br><br>
In the above specific areas of application where maintenance-free (MF/VRLA) battery cannot be used due to its service limitation (i.e. average depth of discharge (DOD) level is very high due to its service requirement), the new battery system can function towards commissioning and auto—maintenance of deep cycle duty conventional type stationary battery throughout its service life. Cells in the battery bank in this area of application is high (between 12 nos. to 550 nos.) and hence, it is very difficult to maintain correct water level in its cells. The innovated single point water pouring system can ensure water pouring in all cells of the battery bank without any risk of malfunctioning. Such desired water pouring in time ensures longer service life of the battery considerably and eliminates manual maintenance relevant hazards and scope of error. In case of lower DOD level requirement (similar to liF/VRLA battery) the battery size and cost can bring down closer to 40% of existing standard cost of the battery will also come down closer to 50% level of existing cost.<br>
In-buiIt type self protection devices for all the above battery. Two main reasons for premature failure of storage battery is high rate charging of battery during high temperature inside cells and/or during water hunting in cells. The newly developed battery's self protection devices disconnect charging line automatically during such stage and the costly battery/battery bank get survived.<br>

1.	In presently available SPWS the valves complicated<br>
and  made of 100% plastic make with rigid linkage  between  float<br>
and  valve. Valve is operated through delicate lever   and  hinge<br>
system, which often create trouble/malfunctioning. The new valves<br>
are  simple  type and made with  plastic  and  non-ferrous  metal<br>
combination and with flexible linkage between float and valve.<br>
2.	In known  SPWS  np repair scope of  these  costly<br>
valves.  The  new battery system there is easy  repairing  scope,<br>
even  by  un-expert man—power. Cost of the valves  is  also  very<br>
1 ess.<br>
3. In known SPWS, the valves operate in a limited range gravity pressure. In case of excess pressure of water beyond the limit the cells will overflow and there is scope of spill age of acid/electrolyte from the cell. Further, if gravity pressure is below required level, either valves do not operate or take long time to pour demineralised water. In the new battery valves are resistant to leakage at high pressure and in no way the demineralised water can be over injected into the cells. There are no question of overflow of cells during which sulphuric acid comes out from cells.<br>
4. In presently available known SPWS momentary water fi11ing/top-up is not possible because electrically operated conventional high-speed pump cannot be used in these SPWP system.<br>
-11-<br><br>
Time consuming gravity fed system only can be used. The new system can be operated by high speed conventional electrical pump water topping up or electrolyte pouring is practically momentary job. For topping up it takes only 2-4 minutes time (approx) and for filling initial electrolyte in cells is only 4/5 minutes job irrespective  of number of cells in the battery.<br>
5.	Gas venting system in known system is in-built  in<br>
the valve. The new system has gas venting system is separate.<br>
6.	In  known  conventional  system  no  scope   for<br>
battery's  self—protection.  New  in-built  type  battery's  self<br>
protection  against  over  temperature, over  filling  and  under<br>
filling is there.<br>
Advantages of the innovated water filling  system (SPWS) :<br>
i. Water/Electrolyte filling job can be done very quickly (between 1 to 5 minutes depending on cell/battery size) with water pump, which automatically switched-of f as soon as water is filled to all cells.  <br>
i i . Ant -sulphuric resion coated domestic FHP-Pumps can be used for pressure feeding of water/electrolyte into the cells.<br>
iii.    Easy repairing scope of the valve/SPWS  by  user, because the system is very simple in nature.<br>
-12-<br><br>
iv. Cost of the innovated valve base SPWS is very less due to its simplicity, easy manufacturing and low-cost material consumption.<br>
v. Water/electrolyte poured into the cell by the system mostly on uniform pressure . Hence, filling time of cells are most1y uniform.<br>
vi. As soon as required water is filled—up into the cells, water line automatically disconnects with signal from water level of cells.<br>
vii. The system can function even to giant battery bank containing 550 numbers of cells, where water pouring can be done through fully automatic system.<br>
viii.    There  are no  scope/possibility  of  overflowing cells even if any valve become disorder/damage.<br>
ix.   Absolute protection of battery against maintenance<br>
relevant fault/error.<br>
The  invention will now be described in detail with reference  to the accompanying drawings —<br>
Figure 1 illustrates the new SPWS  system of the invention.<br>
Figure  2 illustrates the complete battery system of the  present invention.<br>
-13-<br><br>
Figure 3 illustrates the battery self protection system in  block<br>
diagram.<br>
Referring to Fig.1 the valve is operated (i.e. opening and closing) by a float 1 floating in the electrolyte in a cell 2 . Float is connected to the conical valve plug 3 through a string 4 going round a hook fitted underneath the top cover of the valve seating box 5. Valve plug seating box 5 with valve plug 3 assembly is screwed to valve system holder 6 fitted to the hard rubber cell cover 7 of a cell container 2. The total float weight (in air) is greater than valve plug weight. When the electrolyte level in the cell is normal/at pre—fixed level, the float floats in the electrolyte with about 3/4th of its height remaining inside the electrolyte. The difference in weight between float weight and valve plug weight is balanced by hydrostatic up thrust created by displacement of electrolyte by the float portion remaining inside the electrolyte (i.e., weight of electrolyte displaced). In this condition valve plug 3 sits in the plug seating box 5 and keeps the water passage closed,-Water enters the valve seating box through inlet 8. As the level in the cell goes down the valve plug rises and opens the water passage and allows water to flow in and as the level goes up, the float rises, because of hydrostatic pressure, and the valve plug closes the water passage and will stop water flowing into the cells.<br>
- 14 -<br><br>
The valve system fitted in each cell in a battery bank is connected through a series of pipe-line system. Water is fed through an electrically operated water pump which shal1 have its inlet connected to a demineralised water tank and its outlet connected to the inlet end of pipe-line system of the battery bank- Outlet end of the pipeline system goes back to the water tank- The total system is shown in enclosed Fig.2.<br>
When water is to be added to the cells i.e. when water level in the cells has come below pre-set level and consequently all valves have opened, outlet of the water pump will be connected to the inlet of the water pipe line of the battery bank and pump will be started. Water will start flowing into the cells- Level in the cells will rise gradually and as the level in such cell reaches the pre-set level, valves will close automatically and excess water flow out through the outlet pipe connection to demineralised water tank.<br>
There is provision for automatic stoppage of pump, through water level sense based electrical auto-control circuit incorporated in power supply circuit of the pump and built in an electric control panel fitted to pump trolley. As soon as the electrolyte level reaches pre-set maximum level it touches water level sense probes and operates an electrical circuit which trips/stops power supply<br>
— 15-<br><br>
to the pump. There is 5 further provision that so long as the electrolyte level does not come below the pre-set maximum level, water pump cannot foe started through an electrical inter-locking circuit .<br>
Operation of over-temperature and over-charger-protection systems<br>
Temperature of electrolyte is continuously sensed through temperature sensors inserted into the electrolyte of pi lot cells. The temperature sensor operates an electro-magnetic contactor placed in series in the main charger output 1ine going to the battery bank. The temperature sensor disconnects charging of the battery when electrolyte temperature reaches the pre-set upper limit. While starting the charging operation, if the electrolyte temperature is above pre-set maximum limit, charging cannot be started. If charging is once started, when temperature is below the permissible limit and then as the charging proceeds if for any reason temperature goes above the permissible limit normal charging will be terminated and slow-rate charging will be started and continued. During slow-rate charging temperature will come down and then temperature touches the minimum pre-set limit normal charging will be stated again and also slow rate charging will be stopped. Thus the battery shall have protection against over-temperature and consequently over—charging. This will preserve the health of the battery.<br>
-16 —<br><br>
Operation of protection system against charging of battery unless electrolyte level is above minimum pre-set level .<br>
There are two minimum water level sensing probes placed in two cells, one probe in the cell which will be filled up f i rst and another in the cell which will be fi1led up lest. These two probes are connected to an electrical circuit which will operate and electro-magnetic contactor placed in series in main charger lines going to the battery bank. These probes will sense minimum electrolyte level in the relevant cells and allow charging to proceed if the electrolyte level is above the pre~set minimum level. If electrolyte level is below the minimum level as sensed by the probes the said contactor will not close and hence charging can not proceed. However, there is an electrical locking circuit, whereby if once charging, is started, the charging will continue even if during charging electrolyte level falls below the pre-set minimum level.<br>
For technical reasons once the battery is discharged, it should be put on charge immediately thereafter. In other words i t should not be left in discharged state for long to avoid damage to the battery. To eliminate this problem which can occur if there is any problem in the normal battery charger or charging system provision has been for an in-built float—cum—equalising  charging<br>
-17-<br><br>
system for emergency use. This charging current will he at a slow rate just to keep the battery in heal thy condition till its normal charger is put to use.<br>
