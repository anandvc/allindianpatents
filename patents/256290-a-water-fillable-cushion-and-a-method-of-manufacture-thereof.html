FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention, in general, relates to the field of cushions and cushion making technologies. Specifically, this invention relates to a novel technology of finable cushions. More particularly, this invention relates to a novel fillable cushion and a method of manufacture thereof.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART<br>
In the current technologies, cushions are basically stuffed cushions. The stuffing materials commonly used are Cotton, Foam, Rubber, Silk Cotton, etc. These stuffing materials have inherent disadvantages and drawbacks, some of which are:<br>
a)	Cushions stuffed with Cotton, Foam, Rubber, Silk Cotton or the like have a susceptibility to get unevenly compressed by the weight of the load placed on them. This leads to the cushion getting deformed after short usage.<br>
b)	Conventional cushions as described above develop lumps and protrusions due to the inherent shortcomings in the materials used. Such formations lead to discomfort for the user.<br>
c)	If a conventional cushion comes in contact with a liquid such as water or Tea/Coffee, the stuffing material absorbs the liquid and the cushion becomes soggy and unusable.<br>
d)	After such soaking, it is very difficult to get the cushion back to its original shape.<br>
e)	Some or all the above factors greatly reduce the service-life and longevity of the cushion. Moreover, even cost-wise, conventional cushions have seen a steep rise in prices mainly due to high cost of labour and swelling costs of the stuffing materials<br><br>
f) storage when not in use and transport is difficult for the conventional cushions since the size of the cushions cannot be varied when not in use or when required to be transported.<br>
SUMMARY OF INVENTION<br>
The invention disclosed herein comprises a novel fillable cushion particularly suitable as a water cushion and a method of manufacture thereof. To summarize the novel fillable cushion of the invention and its manufacture, the following illustration is put forward:<br>
The fillable cushion comprises two equal sized Polymer Sheets of say 16" X 16" dimensions joined together by High Frequency sealing as a top and a bottom at all the four perimeters to form a airtight / watertight Polymer bag. This airtight / watertight Polymer bag is fitted with a valve on one surface to permit inflow / outflow of water. The said valve has a means of opening / closure. The Polymer used in manufacturing this invention is preferably Thermo Plastic Polyurethane or Poly Vinyl Chloride of thickness ranging from 200 Microns (0.20 mm) to 900 Microns (0.90 mm). However, other materials with similar characteristics may also be used.<br>
The shape of the airtight / watertight Polymer bag is square and in some embodiments rounded or rectangular. The preferred size is 16" X 16". However, in other embodiments, these dimensions could change to appropriately suit the user and range from 10" X 10" to 24" X 24".<br>
In one embodiment circular holes (ranging in diameter from 3 cms to 6 cms) are made through the top and bottom layers coinciding perfectly with each other. The inner-edges formed by making such holes are fused to the top and bottom layers of the Polymer by High Frequency Sealing. This additional feature of providing holes in some embodiments is imparted to offer air circulation.<br><br>
The airtight / watertight Polymer bag thus made forms the "Novel water Cushion".<br>
The quantity of water filled into the novel fillable cushion varies from 500 ml (1/2 Itr.) to 2000 ml (2 Itr). The flexibility of the cushion is varied by the quantity of air / water filled. The rigidity of the cushion is directly proportional to the quantity of air / water filled and conversely, the flexibility of the cushion is inversely proportional to the air / water filled. The filling and deflation of air / water in the novel fillable cushion is performed through a valve which is provided on one surface of the cushion. This valve is moulded from a Polymer that is compatible to the material used for making the body of the novel fillable cushion (Thermo Plastic Polyurethane or Poly Vinyl Chloride) and is fused to the cushion by High Frequency Sealing. The valve is so designed that it will not accidentally open out when load is applied on the cushion in inflated, state. Inflation / deflation of the cushion is by deliberate and fixed steps. When not in use, the cushion can be deflated and folded into a small size facilitating ease of storage and transport.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention encompasses a novel fillable cushion comprising a top and a bottom layer of Polymer sheeting namely Thermo Plastic Polyurethane or Poly Vinyl Chloride Sheeting of fixed size and such sheeting ranging in thickness from 200 Microns (0.20 mm) to 900 Microns (0.90 mm) and such top and bottom Polymer Sheeting of predetermined size joined together at the extremities by a process of High frequency Sealing to form an airtight and watertight Polymer bag and such a bag being provided with a valve for inlet / outlet of air and water and such valve being made of compatible Polymer (Thermo Plastic Polyurethane or Poly Vinyl Chloride Sheeting) fused to the layer of Polymer by High Frequency sealing.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention further encompasses a method of manufacturing the novel fillable cushion as above comprising the steps of:<br>
a.	Selecting the sheets of Thermo Plastic Polyurethane or Poly Vinyl Chloride;<br>
b.	Cutting these sheets to predetermined shapes and sizes;<br><br>
c. Sealing the valve for inlet/outlet of water to the upper layer of the Polymer Sheeting (Thermo Plastic Polyurethane or Poly Vinyl Chloride) of specific size by High Frequency Sealing; d. Joining the outer perimeter of the top and bottom cut sheets of Polymer (Thermo Plastic Polyurethane or Poly Vinyl Chloride) by High Frequency sealing to form an airtight and watertight bag.<br>
These and other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent from the ensuing detailed description of the invention taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPAYNING DRAWINGS<br>
Figure 1 depicts a perspective view of the exterior of the novel fillable cushion according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention. The Thermo Plastic Polyurethane material forming the Top and Bottom Layer (1) of the novel fillable cushion, the High Frequency Sealed joints (2) and the position of the valve for Inlet/Outlet of water (3) are seen in the illustration.<br>
Figure 2 depicts a sectional view of the fitment of the valve inlet/outlet by High Frequency Sealing and shows in detail the valve Inlet/Outlet (3).<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION<br>
The preferred embodiments of the present invention will now be explained with reference to the accompanying drawings. It should be understood however that the disclosed embodiments are merely exemplary of the invention, which may be embodied in various forms. The following description and drawings are not to be construed as limiting the invention and numerous specific details are described to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention, as the basis for the claims and as a basis for teaching one skilled in the art how to make and/or use the invention. However in certain instances, well-known or conventional details<br><br>
are not described in order not to unnecessarily obscure the present invention in detail.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, the fillable cushion comprises two equal sized Polymer Sheets of say 16" X 16" dimensions joined together by High Frequency sealing as a top and a bottom at all the four geometers to form a airtight / watertight Polymer bag. This airtight / watertight Polymer bag is fitted with a valve on one surface to permit inflow / outflow of water. The said valve has a means of opening / closure. The Polymer used in manufactuhng this invention is preferably Thermo Plastic Polyurethane or Poly Vinyl Chloride of thickness ranging from 200 Microns (0.20 mm) to 900 Microns (0.90 mm). However, other materials with similar characteristics may also be used.<br>
The shape of the airtight / watertight Polymer bag is square and in some embodiments rounded or rectangular. The preferred size is 16" X 16". However, in other embodiments, these dimensions could change to appropriately suit the user and range from 10" X 10" to 24" X 24".<br>
In one embodiment circular holes (ranging in diameter from 3 cms to 6 cms) are made through the top and bottom layers coinciding perfectly with each other. The inner-edges formed by making such holes are fused to the top and bottom layers of the Polymer by High Frequency Sealing. This additional feature of providing holes in some embodiments is imparted to offer air circulation.<br>
The airtight / watertight Polymer bag thus made forms the "Novel water Cushion".<br>
The quantity of water filled into the novel fillable cushion varies from 500 ml (1/2 Itr.) to 2000 ml (2 Itr.). The flexibility of the cushion is varied by the quantity of air / water filled. The rigidity of the cushion is directly proportional to the quantity of air / water filled and conversely, the flexibility of the cushion is inversely proportional to the air / water filled. The filling and deflation of air / water in the novel fillable<br><br>
Thermo Plastic Polyurethane is a recent discovery in the Polymer chain and has good abrasion strength and elongation. It is salable at various frequencies and melts at a particular temperature. At the softening temperature, the top and the bottom of the areas to be sealed of the novel water cushion are fused together in an overlapping weld process.<br>
The frequency and duration of the weld depends on the polymer being sealed and other factors, but within the band of 25 megacycles to 75 megacycles lasting between 2 Seconds to 10 Seconds dwell time.<br>
The above process is used to manufacture the novel fillable cushion. Index of the numbers referred to in the accompanying drawings of the preferred embodiment of the novel fillable cushion.<br>
The shape of the novel fillable cushion is Square with the top and bottom layers being 16" X 16" to ideally fit a standard chair, sofa, stool or other furniture. However, other sizes are also suitable depending on the end-use and surroundings.<br>
In one embodiment of the novel fillable cushion, holes are punched through the top &amp; bottom surfaces of the cushion. Such holes ranging in diameter from 2 Cms to 6 Cms. The open edges formed when making these holes are joined by High frequency Sealing thereby giving complete water tightness to the cushion. This additional feature is incorporated in one embodiment to allow air circulation for the person sitting on the cushion.<br>
The present invention also includes a process of manufacturing which includes the steps of:<br>
a.       Selecting the sheets of Thermo Plastic Polyurethane or Poly Vinyl Chloride;<br><br>
b.       Cutting these sheets to predetermined shapes and sizes;<br>
c.	Sealing the valve for inlet/outlet of water to the upper layer of the<br>
Polymer Sheeting (Thermo Plastic Polyurethane or Poly Vinyl Chloride)<br>
of specific size; and<br>
d.	Joining the outer perimeter of the top and bottom cut sheets of Polymer<br>
(Thermo Plastic Polyurethane or Poly Vinyl Chloride) by High<br>
Frequency sealing to form a airtight / watertight bag.<br>
ADVANTAGES<br>
This invention overcomes the disadvantages encountered with conventional cushions available today. Enumerated are a few comparisons highlighting the advantages of this invention.<br><br><br><br><br>
It will also be obvious to those skilled in the art that other control methods and apparatuses can be derived from the combinations of the various methods and apparatuses of the present invention as taught by the description and the accompanying drawings and these shall also be considered within the scope of the present invention. Further, description of such combinations and variations is therefore omitted above.<br>
