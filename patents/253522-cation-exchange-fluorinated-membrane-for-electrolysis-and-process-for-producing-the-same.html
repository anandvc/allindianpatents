				<td>TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001]<br>
The present invention relates to a cation-<br>
exchange membrane for electrolysis, and more<br>
specifically to a cation-exchange membrane for<br>
electrolysis, which is used for electrolyzing an<br>
aqueous solution of an alkali chloride, shows a stable<br>
electrolysis performance while maintaining<br>
electrochemical properties and mechanical strength, and<br>
can improve quality by reducing impurities especially<br>
in an alkali hydroxide produced through an ion<br>
exchange, and relates to a process for producing the<br>
same. <br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
[0002]<br>
Since a fluorine-containing ion-exchange<br>
membrane has a superior heat resistance and chemical<br>
resistance, it is employed in various applications such<br>
as an ion-exchange membrane for electrolysis used in<br>
producing chlorine and an alkali hydroxide by<br>
electrolyzing an alkali chloride, and a barrier<br>
membrane for electrolysis including ozone generation, a<br>
fuel cell, water electrolysis and hydrochloric acid<br>
electrolysis, and its new usage is further expanding.<br>
[0003]<br>
Among these applications, the ion-exchange<br>
membrane method has recently been the most popular<br>
process for producing chlorine and an alkali hydroxide<br>
by electrolyzing an alkali chloride. The ion-exchange<br>
membrane used here is required not only to have a high<br>
current efficiency, low electrolysis voltage, and an<br>
adequate membrane strength to prevent damages during<br>
handling or electrolysis, but also to reduce the<br>
concentration of impurities, especially alkali<br>
chlorides contained in an alkali hydroxide to be<br>
produced. In order to satisfy such requirements,<br>
various proposals have been made. It is widely known<br>
that the mainstream today is a fluorine-containing ion-<br>
exchange membrane having a multi-layered structure<br>
which includes a layer containing a fluorine-containing<br>
resin having a carboxylic acid group with a high<br>
electric resistance but a high current efficiency, and<br>
a layer containing a fluorine-containing resin having a<br>
sulfonic acid group with a low electric resistance,<br>
because of being useful.<br>
[0004]<br>
In addition, although various proposals have<br>
been made to lower electric resistance by increasing<br>
the water content of a membrane, lowering electric<br>
resistance by increasing the ion-exchange capacity of a<br>
layer containing a carboxylic acid group causes a<br>
problem that current efficiency is lowered, and at the<br>
same time, impurities in an alkali hydroxide increase.<br>
Lowering electric resistance by increasing the ion-<br>
exchange capacity of the layer containing a sulfonic<br>
acid group causes a problem that the impurities in an<br>
alkali hydroxide to be produced increases, and besides,<br>
that the strength of the membrane remarkably decreases.<br>
Recently, as Patent Documents 1 and 2<br>
disclose, a reduction in electrolysis voltage and<br>
improvement of membrane strength are attempted by<br>
increasing the number of layers in the membrane and<br>
specifying the water content of each layer. However,<br>
in that case, if the water content of the layer facing<br>
to the anode side is too high, not only the strength of<br>
the membrane decreases, but also the concentration of<br>
impurities contained in alkali hydroxide to be produced<br>
increases.<br>
[0005]<br>
On the other hand, as Patent Document 3<br>
discloses, for instance, a method is also widely known<br>
which improves the strength of the membrane by<br>
embedding a porous substrate formed of a woven fabric<br>
made from a fluorine-containing polymer such as<br>
polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) into the membrane.<br>
Furthermore, a method as in Patent Document 4<br>
has been disclosed, which improves the strength of the<br>
membrane by projecting the shape of the woven fabric<br>
made from PTFE or the like toward the anode side.<br>
However, the method forms a section surrounded by the<br>
projecting parts of the woven fabric pattern, which<br>
reduces an amount of an aqueous solution of an alkali<br>
chloride to be supplied into the anode surface of the<br>
membrane, though depending on the electrolysis<br>
condition or the structure of an electrolysis cell, and<br>
increases an amount of impurities in an alkali<br>
hydroxide to be produced. For this reason, the quality<br>
of the alkali hydroxide cannot be stabilized.<br>
[0006]<br>
Several methods for improving the shape of<br>
the surface of a membrane in an anode side are<br>
disclosed so as to reduce the amount of oxygen in<br>
chlorine produced in the anode side during<br>
electrolysis. Patent Document 5 discloses a method of<br>
forming a groove by transferring the shape of the press<br>
roll having protruding parts to the membrane, and<br>
Patent Document 6 discloses a method of forming a<br>
groove by embedding a woven fabric into the surface of<br>
the membrane and peeling it off. However, the ion-<br>
exchange membranes obtained by these production methods<br>
has to make the thickness of the resin on the porous<br>
substrate substantially thinner, because the porous<br>
substrate made from PTFE or the like preliminarily<br>
embedded in the membrane is pushed up to the reverse<br>
side of the surface of the membrane having the groove<br>
formed thereon, which leads to the lowering of the<br>
strength of the membrane. An ion-exchange membrane<br>
receives stresses from all directions during<br>
electrolysis, so that the ion-exchange membranes<br>
obtained by those production methods show significantly<br>
reduced strength against the stress in the direction<br>
different from the direction of the porous substrate<br>
made from the PTFE or the like, for instance, the<br>
stress in 45-degree direction to the porous substrate,<br>
and consequently cannot provide a stable electrolysis<br>
performance over a long period of time. Furthermore,<br>
the ion-exchange membranes obtained by those methods do<br>
not sufficiently improve the capacity of supplying the<br>
aqueous solution of the alkali chloride into a space<br>
between an anode and the surface of the membrane, and<br>
accordingly cannot reduce the amount of impurities in<br>
the alkali hydroxide to be produced.<br>

DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
Problem to be Solved by the Invention<br>
[0008]<br>
If an alkali hydroxide contains a large<br>
amount of impurities, especially an alkali chloride,<br>
the alkali hydroxide is not suitable for applications<br>
such as a production process for rayon, pulp, paper and<br>
a chemical agent, in which a highly-pure alkali<br>
hydroxide product is required. Accordingly, such a<br>
cation-exchange membrane for electrolysis has been<br>
desperately desired as to be able to reduce the<br>
concentration of impurities in the alkali hydroxide to<br>
be produced.<br>
The present invention relates to an ion-<br>
exchange membrane for electrolysis, which is used for<br>
electrolyzing an aqueous solution of an alkali<br>
chloride, shows a stable electrolysis performance while<br>
maintaining the electrochemical properties and<br>
mechanical strength over a long period of time, can<br>
improve the quality by reducing impurities especially<br>
in an alkali hydroxide produced through an ion<br>
exchange, and consequently has a level that has not<br>
been realized by a conventional technology, and relates<br>
to the process for producing the same.<br>
Means for Solving the Problem<br>
[0009]<br>
The present inventors made an extensive<br>
investigation to solve the above problems, as a result,<br>
found that impurities in an alkali hydroxide to be<br>
produced are generated when an anion enters a membrane<br>
from an anode side, is coupled with a cation and<br>
dissolves in a catholyte as an impurity, and that the<br>
phenomenon becomes apparent when the supply of the<br>
aqueous solution of an alkali chloride is insufficient<br>
on the surface in the anode side of the membrane, and<br>
accomplished the present invention.<br>
[0010]<br>
In more detail, the present inventors<br>
analyzed ion-exchange membranes used in electrolysis<br>
cells made by various manufactures and in various<br>
operating conditions, and as a result, found the fact<br>
that when an anode closely contacting an ion-exchange<br>
membrane has a large area, when a current density of<br>
electrolysis is high, or when an aqueous solution is<br>
electrolyzed in a zero-gap electrolysis cell which<br>
brings the cathode of the electrolysis cell in contact<br>
with the surface of the ion-exchange membrane in the<br>
cathode side, fine foams are formed in the ion-exchange<br>
membrane along the shape of the anode of the<br>
electrolysis cell. As a result of evaluation of the<br>
performance, the present inventors discovered the fact<br>
that the amount of impurities in the alkali hydroxide<br>
increases in that part.<br>
[0011]<br>
The reason why the fine foams are formed in<br>
the ion-exchange membrane was considered as follows: an<br>
aqueous solution of an alkali chloride is not <br>
sufficiently supplied to an anode chamber in the part<br>
where the anode of the electrolysis cell closely<br>
contacts the surface in the anode side of the ion-exchange membrane, and the<br>
concentration of the aqueous solution of the alkali chloride is lowered. Then, in<br>
order to solve the problem, the present inventors studied various shapes of the<br>
surface in the anode side of the ion-exchange membrane and achieved the<br>
present invention.<br>
Accordingly, the aspects of the present invention are as described below.<br>
A cation-exchange membrane for electrolysis comprising a fluorine-<br>
containing polymer having an ion-exchange group and a porous substrate,<br>
characterized in that the membrane has projecting parts comprising a polymer<br>
having an ion-exchange group on the surface of an anode side of the<br>

surface of the anode side of the membrane.<br>

shapes selected from the group consisting of a circular cone-like shape, a<br>

surface of the anode side of the membrane and transferring the embossed shape<br>
of the release paper to the surface, when stacking a fluorine-containing polymer<br>
having an ion-exchange group is layered on a porous substrate, thereby forming<br>
a projecting part comprising a polymer having an ion-exchange group on the<br>
surface of an anode side.<br>

Advantages of the Invention<br>
A fluorine-containing cation-exchange membrane according to the present<br>
invention can reduce impurities in an alkali hydroxide to be produced, while<br>
maintaining electrochemical properties and mechanical<br>
strength in electrolysis of an aqueous solution of an<br>
alkali chloride, and enables a high-quality alkali<br>
hydroxide to be produced over a long period of time.<br>
BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
[0015]<br>
The details of the present invention will now<br>
be described below especially with reference to a<br>
preferred embodiment.<br>
The present invention provides a cation-<br>
exchange membrane for electrolysis comprising a<br>
fluorine-containing polymer having an ion-exchange<br>
group and a porous substrate, characterized in that the<br>
membrane has projecting parts comprising a polymer<br>
having the ion-exchange group on the surface of an<br>
anode side of the membrane; 20 = h = 150, where h is<br>
defined as an average value of heights (µm) from the<br>
surface of the anode side of the membrane to the tops<br>
of the projecting parts; 50 = P = 1,200, where P is<br>
defined as a distribution density (piece/cm2) of the<br>
projecting parts; 0.001 = S = 0.6, where S is defined as<br>
an average value of area fraction (cm2/cm2) of the<br>
bottom faces of the projecting parts on the same plane<br>
as the surface of the anode side of the membrane; and T<br>
= 0.05, where T is defined as the average value of area<br>
fraction (cm2/cm2) of the top parts of the projecting<br>
parts on the surface of the anode side of the membrane.<br>
[0016]<br>
Here, the surface of the anode side means the<br>
membrane surface which faces to the anode when the<br>
cation-exchange membrane for electrolysis according to<br>
the present invention is placed in an electrolysis<br>
cell. In the present invention, the surface of the<br>
anode side has projecting parts comprising a polymer<br>
having an ion-exchange group. In addition, in the<br>
present invention, the membrane surface including the<br>
projecting parts is referred to as "surface of anode<br>
side" for convenience sake, even when the membrane<br>
independently exists by itself without being embedded<br>
in the electrolysis cell.<br>
[0017]<br>
As described above, in the present invention,<br>
projecting parts comprising a polymer having an ion-<br>
exchange group existing on the surface of the anode<br>
side of the membrane preferably has: a height of 20 = h<br>
= 150 and more preferably 20 = h = 120, where h<br>
represents an average value of heights (µm) from the<br>
surface of the anode side of the membrane to the tops<br>
of the projecting parts; a distribution density<br>
(piece/cm2) of the projecting part on the surface of the<br>
anode side of the membrane of 20 = P = 1,500 and more<br>
preferably 50 = P = 1,200; an area fraction of the<br>
bottom faces of 0.001 = S = 0.6, where S is defined as<br>
an average value of the area fractions (cm2/cm2)of the<br>
bottom faces on the same plane as the surface of the<br>
anode side of the membrane; and an area fraction of the<br>
top parts T = 0.05, where T is defined as an average<br>
value of the area fractions (cm2/cm2) of the top parts.<br>
It has not been anticipated that the projecting parts<br>
of such a shape on the surface of the anode side of the<br>
membrane remarkably increase the supply of an aqueous<br>
solution of an alkali chloride onto the surface of the<br>
anode side of the membrane during electrolysis without<br>
damaging the mechanical strength or electrochemical<br>
properties of the membrane, and significantly reduce<br>
impurities in an alkali hydroxide produced by<br>
electrolysis.<br>
[0018]<br>
The projecting parts on the surface of the<br>
anode side of the membrane preferably has a value of<br>
b/a of 0.5 = b/a = 0.9, where a is defined as an average<br>
value of lengths (µm) of the bottom sides on the same<br>
plane as the surface of the anode side of the membrane,<br>
and b is defined as an average value of widths (µm) of<br>
the projecting parts at the half heights h/2 (µm) of<br>
the projecting parts. If the value of b/a is 0.5 or<br>
more, the projecting part has a sufficient height<br>
within a preferred range of distribution density P of<br>
the projecting part necessary in the present invention,<br>
can sufficiently supply the aqueous solution of the<br>
alkali chloride onto the surface of the anode side of<br>
the membrane, does not decrease the strength of the<br>
projecting part, and can easily keep the shape of the<br>
projecting part even when the membrane is pressed<br>
against the anode of an electrolysis cell. If the<br>
value of b/a is 0.9 or less, the area of the projecting<br>
part contacting the anode of the electrolysis cell does<br>
not become excessive, and an adequate amount of the<br>
aqueous solution of the alkali chloride in an anode<br>
chamber of the electrolysis cell is supplied to the<br>
surface of the anode side of the membrane.<br>
Furthermore, the projecting part hardly decreases its<br>
strength.<br>
[0019]<br>
The projecting parts in a more preferred<br>
embodiment satisfy 0.25 = h/a = 0.80 in terms of a<br>
relation between an average height h ((µm) of the<br>
projecting part on the surface of the anode side of the<br>
membrane and an average length a (µm) of the bottom<br>
side of the projecting part on the same plane as the<br>
surface of the anode side of the membrane. If the<br>
value of h/a is 0.25 or more, the projecting parts have<br>
sufficient height, the aqueous solution of the alkali<br>
chloride is sufficiently supplied, the area of the<br>
projecting part on the surface of the anode side of the<br>
membrane contacting the anode of the electrolysis cell<br>
does not become excessive, the fine foams can be<br>
inhibited from forming in the membrane, and the<br>
electrolysis performance can be inhibited from<br>
lowering. On the other hand, if the value of h/a is<br>
0.8 or less, the projecting part does not decrease the<br>
strength, which stabilizes the electrolysis<br>
performance.<br>
[0020]<br>
The projecting part including a polymer<br>
having an ion-exchange group is preferably<br>
discontinuous on the surface of the anode side of the<br>
membrane according to the present invention. The<br>
projecting part having the shape can make the aqueous<br>
solution of the alkali chloride sufficiently be<br>
supplied during electrolysis. Here, "being<br>
discontinuous" means that the projecting parts do not<br>
form an enclosed space on the surface of the anode side<br>
by connecting with each other to form a continuous wall<br>
in a narrow range of the membrane surface. The<br>
projecting part on the surface of the anode side of the<br>
membrane has preferably a shape of a circular cone, a<br>
multi-angular pyramid such as a triangular pyramid and<br>
a quadrangular pyramid, a hemisphere, a dome, a<br>
circular truncated cone, or a truncated multi-angular<br>
pyramid, and more preferably has a circular cone-like<br>
shape, a circular truncated cone-like shape, a<br>
quadrangular pyramid-like shape, a truncated<br>
quadrangular pyramid-like shape or the like, because<br>
the shape is superior in a contacting area between the<br>
projecting part and the anode of the electrolysis cell,<br>
and the balance of the strength of the projecting part.<br>
The projecting parts of the surface of the anode side<br>
of the membrane may have a single shape or a mixed<br>
shape of two or more shapes selected from these shapes.<br>
[0021]<br>
Here, an average value a (µm) of lengths of<br>
the bottom sides on the same plane as the surface of<br>
the anode side of the membrane was obtained by cutting<br>
the cross section of the membrane passing the top of<br>
the projecting part into a thin film, and observing it<br>
with the magnification of 40 times by using an optical<br>
microscope. Specifically, when the projecting part has<br>
a shape of a circular cone, a circular truncated cone,<br>
a hemisphere or a dome, the bottom face of the<br>
projecting part was considered to be a circle, and the<br>
diameter was observed. On the other hand, when the<br>
projecting part has a shape of a quadrangular pyramid<br>
or a truncated quadrangular pyramid, the shape of the<br>
bottom face was considered to be a square and the<br>
length of a side was observed. The length of a side of<br>
the projecting part was determined. The average value<br>
was determined by observing 10 sides in each case.<br>
[0022]<br>
Subsequently, the average value of heights h<br>
(µm) of the projecting parts and a half height h/2 (µm)<br>
of the projecting part were determined by cutting the<br>
cross section of the membrane passing the top of the<br>
projecting part into a thin film, and observing it with<br>
the magnification of 40 times by using an optical<br>
microscope. The average value was determined from the<br>
result of having observed 10 pieces of the cross<br>
sections. A width b (µm) of the projecting part at the<br>
half height h/2 of the projecting part was determined<br>
by measuring the diameter when the projecting part has<br>
a shape of a circular cone or a truncated circular<br>
cone, and by measuring the length of a side when the<br>
projecting part has a shape of a quadrangular pyramid<br>
or a truncated quadrangular pyramid. The average value<br>
was obtained similarly by observing 10 pieces.<br>
[0023]<br>
Furthermore, the average value of area<br>
fractions S (cm2/cm2) of the bottom faces of the<br>
projecting parts on the same plane as the surface of<br>
the anode side of the membrane was determined by using<br>
the value of a and by approximating the area of the<br>
bottom face into the area of a circle or the area of a<br>
polygonal shape. An average value T (cm2/cm2) of an<br>
area fraction of the top part of the projecting part<br>
was approximately determined by cutting the cross<br>
section of the membrane into a thin film; observing the<br>
projecting part with the magnification of 100 times by<br>
using an optical microscope; measuring an average value<br>
of widths of the part 5 µm lower from the top of the<br>
projecting part toward the bottom face; and supposing<br>
the area of the cut shape as the area of a circle when<br>
the projecting part has a shape of the circular cone or<br>
the truncated circular cone and supposing the area of<br>
the cut shape as the area of the polygonal shape when<br>
the projecting part has a shape of the pyramid or the<br>
truncated pyramid. In addition, the values of S and T<br>
were respectively determined as the percentages of the<br>
areas of the bottom faces and the top parts to the unit<br>
area of the surface of the anode side of the membrane.<br>
The distribution density P (piece/cm2) of the projecting<br>
parts was determined by observing the surface of the<br>
anode side of the membrane with the magnification of 40<br>
times by using an optical microscope.<br>
[0024]<br>
A porous substrate used in the present<br>
invention is used for imparting strength and<br>
dimensional stability to a membrane, and it is<br>
indispensably required that the most of the porous<br>
substrate exists in the membrane. Such a porous<br>
substrate is required to have heat resistance and<br>
chemical resistance over a long period of time, and<br>
accordingly is preferably formed of fibers made from a<br>
fluorinated polymer. The examples of the fluorinated<br>
polymer include polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE),<br>
tetrafluoroethylene-perfluoroalkyl vinyl ether<br>
copolymer (PFA), tetrafluoroethylene-ethylene copolymer<br>
(ETFE), tetrafluoroethylene-hexafluoro propylene<br>
copolymer, trifluorochloroethylene-ethylene copolymer<br>
and vinylidene fluoride polymer (PVDF). However, it is<br>
preferable to use a fiber made from<br>
polytetrafluoroethylene in particular.<br>
[0025]<br>
A porous substrate to be used in the present<br>
invention is formed of fibers having a diameter<br>
preferably of 20 to 300 denier, and more preferably of<br>
50 to 250 denier; and is woven at a weave density<br>
preferably of 5-50 lines/inch. The porous substrate to<br>
be used has a shape of a fabric cloth, a nonwoven cloth<br>
or a knitted cloth, but preferably has the shape of the<br>
fabric cloth. The fabric cloth has a thickness<br>
preferably of 30 to 250 µm, and more preferably of 30<br>
to 150 µm.<br>
[0026]<br>
The fabric cloth or a knitted cloth of the<br>
porous substrate employs a monofilament, a<br>
multifilament, or a yarn thereof, a slit yarn or the<br>
like, and is woven with various types of weaving<br>
methods such as a plane fabric, a leno weave, a knit<br>
weave, a cord weave, and a seersucker.<br>
The fabric cloth or the knitted cloth has an<br>
opening rate preferably of 30% or more, and more<br>
preferably of 50% or more and 90% or less. The opening<br>
rate is preferably 30% or more from the viewpoint of<br>
electrochemical properties as an ion-exchange membrane,<br>
and is preferably 90% or less from the viewpoint of a<br>
mechanical strength of the membrane.<br>
[0027]<br>
A particularly preferable form among these<br>
various forms of porous substrates includes, for<br>
instance, a form which employs a tape yarn prepared by<br>
slitting a high-strength porous sheet made from PTFE<br>
into a shape of a tape, or a highly oriented<br>
monofilament of 50 to 300 denier made from PTFE, has a<br>
plain-weave structure with a weave density of 10 to 50<br>
lines/inch, and further has a thickness in a range of<br>
50 to 100 µm and an opening rate of 50% or more.<br>
Furthermore, the fabric cloth may include a supporting<br>
fiber which is usually referred to as a sacrificial<br>
core material, for the purpose of preventing a<br>
deviation of a texture of the porous substrate in a<br>
process of producing the membrane. The supporting<br>
fiber has solubility in the process of producing the<br>
membrane or under an electrolysis environment. A<br>
material to be used for the supporting fiber includes<br>
rayon, polyethylene terephthalate (PET), cellulose and<br>
polyamide. The amount of the blended fabric of the<br>
supporting fiber in this case is preferably 10 to 80<br>
wt%, and more preferably is 30 to 70 wt% with respect<br>
to the whole fabric cloth or the whole knitted cloth.<br>
[0028]<br>
A fluorine-containing polymer used in the<br>
present invention is a polymer formed of a main chain<br>
of fluorinated hydrocarbon, has a functional group as a<br>
pendant side chain, which is transformable to an ion-<br>
exchange group by hydrolysis and the like, and can be<br>
melt-processed.<br>
[0029]<br>
In the next place, an example of a general<br>
production method of such a fluorine-containing polymer<br>
will be described.<br>
A fluorine-containing polymer can be produced<br>
by copolymerizing at least one monomer selected from<br>
the following first group with at least one monomer<br>
selected from the following second group and/or third<br>
group.<br>
The monomer of the first group is a vinyl<br>
fluoride compound, for instance, at least one compound<br>
that is selected from vinyl fluoride,<br>
hexafluoropropylene, vinylidene fluoride,<br>
trifluoroethylene, chlorotrifluoroethylene,<br>
perfluoro(alkyl vinyl ether) and tetrafluoroethylene,<br>
and when the polymer is used particularly as a membrane<br>
for alkaline electrolysis, is preferably selected from<br>
tetrafluoroethylene, perfluoro(alkyl vinyl ether) and<br>
hexafluoropropylene, which are perfluoromonomers<br>
containing no hydrogen.<br>
[0030]<br>
The monomer of the second group is a vinyl<br>
compound having a functional group which is<br>
transformable to a carboxylic acid type ion-exchange<br>
group. A monomer to be generally used is expressed by<br>
the formula of CF2=CF (OCF2CYF) s-O (CZF) t-COOR. Here, s is<br>
an integer of 0 to 2, t is an integer of 1 to 12, Y and<br>
Z represent F or CF3, and R represents a lower alkyl<br>
group.<br>
A preferable monomer is a compound expressed<br>
by CF2=CFO(CF2CYFO)n- (CF2)m-COOR. Here, n is an integer<br>
of 0 to 2, m is an integer of 1 to 4, Y represents F or<br>
CF3, R represents CH3, C2H5 and C3H7.<br>
When the polymer is used particularly as a<br>
membrane for alkaline electrolysis, the monomer is<br>
preferably a perfluoro compound, but only R (lower<br>
alkyl group) is not necessary to be a perfluoro type,<br>
because it disappears when the functional group is<br>
hydrolyzed into the ion-exchange group. Such a<br>
preferable monomer includes, for instance, CF2=CFOCF2-<br>
CF (CF3) -0-CF2COOCH3, CF2=CFOCF2CF (CF2) 0 (CF2) 2COOCH3,<br>
CF2=CF [OCF2-CF (CF) 3] 2O (CF2) 2COOCH3,<br>
CF2=CFOCF2CF(CF3)0(CF3)3COOCH3, CF2=CFO (CF2) 2COOCH3 and<br>
CF2=CFO (CF2) 3COOCH3 .<br>
[0031]<br>
The monomer of the third group is a vinyl<br>
compound having a functional group which is<br>
transformable to a sulfone type ion-exchange group. A<br>
preferable compound is expressed by the general formula<br>
of CF2=CFO-X-CF2-SO2F, where X is a group selected from<br>
various types of perfluorocarbon groups. A specific<br>
example of the compound includes CF2=CFOCF2CF2SO2F,<br>
CF2=CFOCF2CF (CF3) OCF2CF2SO2F,<br>
CF2=CFOCF2CF(CF3)OCF2CF2CF2S02F, CF2=CF (CF2) 2S02F,<br>
CF2=CFO [CF2CF (CF3) O] 2CF2CF2S02F, and<br>
CF2=CFOCF2CF(CF2OCF3)OCF2CF2SO2F, and a particularly<br>
preferable example among these is<br>
CF2=CFOCF2CF (CF3) OCF2CF2CF2SO2F and<br>
CF2=CFOCF2CF (CF3) OCF2CF2SO2F.<br>
[0032]<br>
A copolymer of these monomers can be produced<br>
with a polymerization method developed for single<br>
fluorinated ethylene and a copolymer thereof, and<br>
particularly with a general polymerization method used<br>
for tetrafluoroethylene. For instance, there is a non-<br>
aqueous method which includes: employing an inert<br>
liquid such as perfluoro hydrocarbon and chloro<br>
fluorocarbon as a solvent; using a radical-<br>
polymerization initiator such as a perfluorocarbon<br>
peroxide and an azo compound; and can copolymerize the<br>
monomer at a temperature of 0 to 200°C and a pressure of<br>
0.1 to 20 MPa.<br>
A type and a ratio of the monomers to be used<br>
for copolymerization are selected and determined from<br>
among the above described three groups according to a<br>
type and amount of a desired functional group required<br>
for a fluorinated polymer.<br>
[0033]<br>
For instance, when a polymer containing only<br>
a carboxylic ester functional group is required, it is<br>
acceptable to select at least one monomer respectively<br>
from the monomers of the first group and the second<br>
group, and copolymerize them.<br>
On the other hand, when a polymer containing<br>
only a sulfonyl fluoride functional group is required,<br>
it is acceptable to select at least one monomer<br>
respectively from the monomers of the first group and<br>
the third group, and copolymerize them.<br>
Furthermore, when a polymer containing both<br>
of two functional groups, carboxylic ester and sulfonyl<br>
fluoride, is required, it is acceptable to select at<br>
least one monomer respectively from the monomers of the<br>
first group, the second group and the third group, and<br>
copolymerize them.<br>
In this case, an objective fluorinated<br>
polymer can be obtained by separately polymerizing a<br>
copolymer from monomers of the first group and the<br>
second group and a copolymer from monomers of the first<br>
group and the third group, and then mixing the<br>
copolymers. As for a mixing ratio of each monomer,<br>
when it is desired to increase an amount of the<br>
required functional group per unit monomer, it is<br>
acceptable to increase the ratio of the monomers<br>
selected from the second group or the third group.<br>
[0034]<br>
An ion-exchange membrane according to the<br>
present invention having an ion-exchange capacity in a<br>
range preferably of 0.5 to 2.0 mg equivalent weight/g<br>
of dried resin, and more preferably of 0.6 to 1.5 mg<br>
equivalent weight/g of dried resin in general, after<br>
the whole amount of the functional groups have been<br>
converted to an exchange group is used.<br>
A process for producing an ion-exchange<br>
membrane according to the present invention is<br>
characterized in that a projecting part including a<br>
polymer having an ion-exchange group is formed on the<br>
surface of an anode side by bringing an embossed<br>
release paper closely in contact with the surface of<br>
the anode side and transferring the embossed shape of<br>
the release paper to the surface, when a fluorine-<br>
containing polymer having an ion-exchange group is<br>
layered on a porous substrate.<br>
[0035]<br>
Here, an objective shape is previously<br>
embossed on the release paper to be used when<br>
integrating the film with the porous substrate, in<br>
order to provide the projecting part on the surface of<br>
the membrane in the anode side, which is an object of<br>
the present invention. A method for forming the<br>
embossed shape on the release paper includes, for<br>
instance, the steps of: bringing the release paper<br>
closely in contact with the heated metallic roll having<br>
a surface to which an objective projecting shape is<br>
formed in advance; and pressing the release paper to<br>
the heated metallic roll by using a pressure roll made<br>
from a resin, at a forming temperature preferably of 20<br>
to 120°C and more preferably of 25 to 80°C, with a line<br>
pressure of preferably 500N/cm or more and more<br>
preferably of 600 to 2,000N/cm, and at a forming speed<br>
preferably of 50m/minute or smaller, and more<br>
preferably of 40m/minute or smaller. In addition, the<br>
depth of an embossed recess can be controlled by<br>
changing the line pressure of the pressure roll made<br>
from a resin for pressing the release paper to the<br>
heated metal roll. The basis weight of the release<br>
paper to be used may be selected from a comparatively<br>
wide range, but preferably is 50 to 400g/m2 from the<br>
viewpoint of handling resistance and heat resistance.<br>
[0036]<br>
In addition, when transferring the embossed<br>
shape to the membrane, it is preferable for keeping the<br>
mechanical strength of the membrane to employ a method<br>
of bringing the release paper closely contact with the<br>
surface of the membrane in an anode side by reducing<br>
the pressure through the release paper.<br>
Furthermore, it is preferable for surely<br>
transferring a previously embossed shape formed on the<br>
release paper to the surface of the membrane in the<br>
anode side to control the temperature of the surface of<br>
the membrane preferably at 180°C or higher and 300°C or<br>
lower.<br>
In addition, when embossing the release<br>
paper, it is preferable to employ the release paper<br>
having the air permeability of 0.03 MPa or less, and<br>
preferably of 0.025 MPa or less and emboss the release<br>
paper under a reduced pressure, in order to further<br>
improve the adhesiveness of the release paper to the<br>
membrane and surely transfer a previously embossed<br>
shape formed on the release paper.<br>
The air permeability of the release paper was<br>
measured with a pneumatic micrometer type testing<br>
instrument according to a standard of JAPAN TAPPI No. 5<br>
- 1:2000.<br>
[0037]<br>
The release paper can have any embossed shape<br>
thereon because the metallic roll transfers an<br>
embossing shape formed thereon to the surface of the<br>
release paper.<br>
In order to achieve the purpose of the<br>
present invention, various shapes can be selected from<br>
the shapes of a circular cone, a multi-angular pyramid<br>
such as a triangular pyramid and a quadrangular<br>
pyramid, a hemisphere, a dome, a circular truncated<br>
cone and a truncated pyramid, and mixed shapes of two<br>
or more of the above shapes may be selected.<br>
[0038]<br>
In addition, the average height of the<br>
embossed shape is preferably 20 to 150 µm, and more<br>
preferably is 20 to 120 µm, as described above, because<br>
when the ion-exchange membrane is integrated,<br>
approximately the same shape as the embossed shape is<br>
transferred to the surface of the anode side of the<br>
membrane. Furthermore, a distribution density of<br>
embossment is preferably 20 to 1,500 pieces/cm2, and<br>
more preferably is 50 to 1,200 pieces/cm2. An average<br>
value of an area fraction of bottom faces of the<br>
embossed shape is preferably 0.001 to 0.6 cm2/cm2. An<br>
area fraction of the top part of the embossed shape<br>
differs depending on the embossed shape, but is<br>
preferably 0.05 cm2/cm2 or less in any case.<br>
The embossed shape preferably has such a<br>
relationship between a and b as to satisfy the<br>
expression of 0.5 = b/a = 0.9, where a is defined as an<br>
average value of lengths of the bottom sides of the<br>
bottom faces in the embossed shape, and b is defined as<br>
an average value of widths at the half height of the<br>
embossed shape; and preferably has such a relationship<br>
between a and h as to satisfy the expression of 0.25 =<br>
h/a = 0.8, where a is defined as the average value of<br>
the lengths of the bottom sides of the bottom faces in<br>
the embossed shape, and h is defined as an average<br>
value of heights of the embossed shape.<br>
[0039]<br>
When the membrane described above is produced<br>
by using the release paper, the membrane acquires<br>
projecting parts comprising a polymer having an ion-<br>
exchange group formed on the surface in an anode side,<br>
the projecting parts mitigate the adhesiveness of the<br>
membrane to an anode while electrolysis, and an alkali<br>
chloride solution in the anode side is sufficiently<br>
supplied to the surface of the anode side of the<br>
membrane. Thus, the object of the present invention can<br>
be achieved.<br>
The embossed recess formed in the release<br>
paper is preferably discontinuous. If the embossed<br>
recesses form a closed shape such as grid, the part<br>
surrounded by the projecting part is formed, when the<br>
embossed shape is transferred to the surface of the<br>
anode side of the membrane. The surrounded part makes<br>
it difficult for the alkali chloride solution to be<br>
sufficiently supplied to the anode side during<br>
electrolysis.<br>
The recesses embossed in the release paper<br>
may be regularly arrayed or arranged at random, as long<br>
as the arrangement does not exceed the range of the<br>
distribution density and the depth of the embossed<br>
recess according to the present invention.<br>
[0040]<br>
A particularly preferred method includes<br>
forming a film by coextruding a fluorine-containing<br>
polymer (first layer) which contains a carboxylic ester<br>
functional group and is located in a cathode side and a<br>
fluorine-containing polymer (second layer) which<br>
contains a sulfonyl fluoride functional group. Aside<br>
from the above prepared film, a fluorine-containing<br>
polymer (third layer) which contains a sulfonyl<br>
fluoride functional group is singly formed into a film<br>
beforehand. Those prepared films are integrated by the<br>
steps of: stacking the third layer film, a porous<br>
substrate and a composite film of the second layer with<br>
the first layer in this order on a flat plate or a drum<br>
which is provided with a heat source and a vacuum<br>
source and has many pores on the surface, through a<br>
heat-resistant release paper having gas permeability;<br>
and integrating them at a temperature at which each<br>
polymer melts while removing air among the layers by<br>
reducing pressure. Here, coextruding the first layer<br>
and the second layer contributes to the enhancement of<br>
the adhesive strength between the interfaces, and<br>
integration of the layers under the reduced pressure<br>
has a feature of making the thickness of the third<br>
layer on the porous substrate larger, in comparison<br>
with a pressurization process. Furthermore, sufficient<br>
mechanical strength of the membrane can be retained,<br>
because the porous substrate is fixed in the inner face<br>
of the membrane.<br>
[0041]<br>
In the above description, for the purpose of<br>
enhancing the electrical performance of the ion-<br>
exchange membrane, a fourth layer containing both<br>
functional groups of carboxylate ester and sulfonyl<br>
fluoride can be interposed between the first layer and<br>
the second layer, or the second layer itself can be<br>
replaced with the layer containing both of the<br>
functional groups of the carboxylic ester and the<br>
sulfonyl fluoride. In this case, a process may be<br>
employed which separately produces a polymer containing<br>
the sulfonyl fluoride functional group, and a polymer<br>
containing the carboxylic ester functional group, and<br>
then mixing the polymers, or a process may be also<br>
employed which copolymerizes both of a monomer<br>
containing the carboxylic ester functional group and a<br>
monomer containing the sulfonyl fluoride functional<br>
group. When inserting the forth layer as a structure<br>
of the membrane, it is an acceptable process to form a<br>
co-extruded film of the first layer and the fourth<br>
layer, singly form the third layer and the second layer<br>
into films separately, and stack them with the above<br>
described method, or to form a film by coextruding<br>
three layers of the first layer, the fourth layer and<br>
the second layer at one time.<br>
[0042]<br>
Here, the first layer has a thickness<br>
preferably of 5 to 50 µm and more preferably of 5 to 30<br>
µm The second layer has a thickness preferably of 30<br>
to 120 µm and more preferably of 40 to 100 µm, because<br>
of being a layer of dominating the strength of the<br>
membrane. The third layer has a thickness preferably<br>
of 15 to 50 µ. Furthermore, when interposing the above<br>
described fourth layer between the first layer and the<br>
second layer, the total thickness of the ion-exchange<br>
membrane prior to hydrolysis is appropriately<br>
controlled to preferably 200 µm or less and more<br>
preferably in a range of 50 to 180 µm. The thickness<br>
of the membrane is particularly preferably 50 µm or<br>
more from the viewpoint of mechanical strength, and is<br>
180 µm or less from the viewpoint of electrolytic<br>
resistance.<br>
[0043]<br>
As mentioned before, the cation-exchange<br>
membrane for electrolysis is required to cause a low<br>
voltage. As one method for lowering the voltage, a<br>
method is employed which decreases the thickness of a<br>
layer made from a fluororesin containing a carboxylic<br>
acid group, and the layer made from a fluororesin<br>
containing a sulfonic acid group. In this case, as for<br>
the strength of the membrane, there is a problem that<br>
the strength of the membrane decreases proportionally<br>
to the thickness of the membrane. In order to prevent<br>
the decrease of the strength of the membrane, a method<br>
is adopted which embeds a porous substrate made from<br>
PTFE or the like in the membrane, but the ion-exchange<br>
membrane containing the porous substrate makes a resin<br>
layer around the porous substrate the thinnest part<br>
which strongly affects the strength of the membrane.<br>
Accordingly, in order not to decrease the<br>
strength of the ion-exchange membrane, such a<br>
production method is effective as not to decrease the<br>
thickness of the resin layer around the porous<br>
substrate.<br>
[0044]<br>
A method of transferring an embossed shape<br>
previously formed on a release paper to the surface of<br>
the membrane according to the present specification can<br>
provide discontinuous projecting parts made from a<br>
fluorinated resin on the surface of the anode side of<br>
the ion-exchange membrane without thinning the resin<br>
layer around the porous substrate, and can improve the<br>
surface of the anode side of the membrane in a shape<br>
without lowering the strength of the membrane. In<br>
addition, a production method according to the present<br>
invention does not make a melted fluorine-containing<br>
polymer directly contact a roll, and accordingly can<br>
prevent the metallic roll from being corroded even when<br>
forming the projecting parts, for instance, by using<br>
the metallic roll. Furthermore, the production method<br>
according to the present invention provides small and<br>
discontinuous projecting parts on the surface of the<br>
anode side of the membrane, consequently reduces a<br>
contact portion between the anode in an electrolytic<br>
tank and the surface of the membrane, makes an alkali<br>
chloride solution sufficiently be supplied, and<br>
accordingly can largely reduce impurities in an alkali<br>
hydroxide to be produced.<br>
[0045]<br>
A membrane according to the present invention<br>
may have an inorganic coating layer for preventing the<br>
gases from being entrapped on the surfaces of the<br>
cathode side and the anode side, as needed. The<br>
coating layer can be formed on the membrane, for<br>
instance, by spraying a liquid having fine inorganic<br>
oxide particles dispersed in a polymer binder solution.<br>
The fluorine-containing cation-exchange<br>
membrane according to the present invention can be used<br>
for various types of electrolysis, but the case of<br>
being used for the electrolysis of an aqueous alkali<br>
chloride solution will now be described here, as a<br>
representative example. A known condition can be<br>
adopted as an electrolysis condition. For instance,<br>
the electrolysis is conducted on the conditions of an<br>
electrolysis temperature of 50 to 120°C and a current<br>
density of 5 to 100 A/dm2, while supplying a 2.5 to 5.5<br>
normal (N) aqueous solution of an alkali chloride into<br>
an anode chamber, and supplying water or a diluted<br>
aqueous solution of an alkali hydroxide into a cathode<br>
chamber.<br>
[0046]<br>
An electrolysis cell, in which a fluorine-<br>
containing cation-exchange membrane for electrolysis<br>
according to the present invention is used, may be a<br>
single-electrode type or a double-electrode type as<br>
long as the tank has the above described structure<br>
including a cathode and an anode. The electrolysis<br>
cell is formed preferably, for instance, from titanium<br>
as a material having resistance to an alkali chloride<br>
and chlorine in an anode chamber, and from nickel as a<br>
material having resistance to an alkali hydroxide and<br>
hydrogen in a cathode chamber. As for the arrangement<br>
of electrodes, the fluorine-containing cation-exchange<br>
membrane for electrolysis according to the present<br>
invention and the anode may be arranged at a suitable<br>
space, but in the case of the membrane according to the<br>
present invention, the purpose can be achieved without<br>
any problem even if the anode and the ion-exchange<br>
membrane are arranged so as to contact each other. In<br>
addition, the cathode is generally arranged adjacent to<br>
the ion-exchange membrane at a suitable space, but an<br>
advantage offered by the present invention is not lost<br>
even in a contact type electrolysis cell having no such<br>
space (zero-gap-type electrolysis cell).<br>
In the next place, the present invention will<br>
now be described with reference to examples and<br>
comparative examples.<br>
Examples<br>
[0047]<br>
The present invention will now be described<br>
below with reference to the examples and the<br>
comparative examples, but the present invention is not<br>
limited to these examples at all.<br>
In the examples and comparative examples, the<br>
electrolysis was conducted in a self-circulation type<br>
electrolysis cell with an area of 1 dm2 having a cathode<br>
of an expanded metal and an anode of a porous plate<br>
(having pores of 4 mmF arranged at 6 pitches, open area<br>
rate of 40%), at a temperature of 90°C with a current<br>
density of 60 A/dm2 for seven days, while supplying an<br>
aqueous solution of sodium chloride controlled to the<br>
concentration of 205 g/liter to an anode side, keeping<br>
the concentration of caustic soda of a cathode side at<br>
32% by weight, and setting a differential pressure<br>
between a fluid pressure in the cathode side of the<br>
electrolysis cell and a fluid pressure in the anode<br>
side so that the fluid pressure of the cathode side can<br>
be higher by 8.8 kPa.<br>
[0048]<br>
Example 1<br>
A fabric cloth with a thickness of 100 µm was<br>
obtained as a porous substrate by the steps of:<br>
preparing a thread by twisting a tape yarn of 100<br>
deniers made from polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) at 900<br>
times/m; preparing a supporting fiber (sacrificial<br>
thread) by twisting 6 filaments of polyethylene<br>
terephthalate (PET) of 30 deniers at 200 times/m as a<br>
warp; preparing a weft by twisting 8 filaments of a PET<br>
thread of 35 deniers at 10 times/m; and plain-weaving<br>
these threads while alternately disposing the PTFE<br>
threads at 24 threads per inch and the sacrificial<br>
threads at 64 threads per inch which is 4 times higher<br>
density than that of the PTFE threads. The obtained<br>
fabric cloth was controlled into the thickness of 70 µm<br>
by being crimped by a heated metallic roll. At this<br>
time, the open area ratio of only the PTFE thread was<br>
75%.<br>
[0049]<br>
Next, a polymer (A) was prepared which was a<br>
copolymer of CF2=CF2 and CF2=CFOCF2CF (CF3) OCF2CF2COOCH3,<br>
and had an ion-exchange capacity of 0.85 mg<br>
equivalent/g dry resin; a polymer (B) was prepared<br>
which was a copolymer of CF2=CF2 and<br>
CF2=CFOCF2CF(CF3)OCF2CF2S02F, and had an ion-exchange<br>
capacity of 0.95 mg equivalent/g dry resin; and a<br>
polymer (C) was prepared which had the same structure<br>
as the polymer (B) and had an ion-exchange capacity of<br>
1.05 mg equivalent/g dry resin. A dual-layer film (x)<br>
was prepared by coextruding the above polymers with a<br>
T-die technique. The film was formed of the polymer<br>
(A) with the thickness of 25 µm and the polymer (B)<br>
with the thickness of 75 µm. In addition, a film (y)<br>
with the thickness of 25 µm formed of a polymer (C) was<br>
obtained with a single-layer T-die technique.<br>
[0050]<br>
Next, a metallic roll having protrusions<br>
(projecting parts) on the surface was prepared, which<br>
had a circular truncated cone shape, a average height<br>
of 150 urn, a distribution density of about 500<br>
pieces/cm2, an area fraction of the bottom faces of<br>
0.157 cm2/cm2, a length of the bottom sides of 200 µm,<br>
and a width of 125 µm at the half height of the<br>
protruding part, and was heated to 40°C; and an embossed<br>
shape was formed on a release paper with a basis weight<br>
of 127 g/m2 by crimping the release paper with the<br>
heated metallic roll and a resinous pressure roll at a<br>
line pressure of 1,000 N/cm for the resinous pressure<br>
roll at a embossing speed of 10 m/min.<br>
[0051]<br>
The air permeability of the release paper<br>
used herein before being embossed was 0.005 MPa when<br>
measured with a pneumatic micrometer type tester<br>
according to a technical standard of JAPAN TAPPI NO.5-<br>
1:2000.<br>
A composite membrane was obtained by the<br>
steps of: stacking the release paper, the film (y), the<br>
porous substrate and the film (x) of various materials<br>
obtained here in this order, on a drum having a heat<br>
source and a vacuum source in the inner part, and<br>
having fine pores on its surface; crimping the stacked<br>
films while heating and depressurizing them; and then<br>
removing the release paper. At this time, a forming<br>
temperature was 225°C and a reduced pressure was 0.022<br>
MPa.<br>
[0052]<br>
The surface of the obtained membrane was<br>
observed, and as a result, it was confirmed that a film<br>
(y) of an anode side had projecting parts with a<br>
truncated-cone-like shape formed thereon, which have<br>
the height of about 45 µm by an average value h, are<br>
distributed at a density P of 500 pieces/cm2, have such<br>
bottom faces as to occupy about 0.04 cm2/cm2 by an<br>
average value S of area fraction, have such top parts<br>
as to occupy about 0.012 cm2/cm2 by an average value T<br>
of area fraction, have bottom sides with the length of<br>
about 100 µm by an average value a, have a width of<br>
about 7 5 µm by an average value b at the half height of<br>
the projecting part, and are made from a polymer having<br>
an ion-exchange group. At this time, a value of b/a<br>
was 0.75 and a value of h/a was 0.45.<br>
[0053]<br>
Next, the obtained composite membrane was<br>
hydrolyzed at 90°C for one hour, and then was rinsed and<br>
dried. Furthermore, a suspension was prepared by<br>
adding and dispersing 20% by weight of zirconium oxide<br>
particles with a primary particle diameter of 0.02 µm<br>
into an ethanol solution containing 5% by weight of an<br>
acid type polymer of a polymer (C), and a gas-releasing<br>
coating film of 0.5 mg/cm2 was formed on both surfaces<br>
of the above described composite membrane by spraying<br>
the suspension with a spraying technique.<br>
[0054]<br>
Tensile strength, tensile elongation and<br>
electrolysis performance were evaluated on the<br>
fluorine-containing cation-exchange membrane obtained<br>
as described above. The tensile strength and the<br>
tensile elongation were measured according to JIS K6732<br>
by the steps of: preparing a sample which was taken out<br>
from the membrane in a direction of 45 degrees with<br>
respect to a porous substrate embedded in the membrane<br>
and had a width of 1 cm; and stretching the sample on<br>
conditions of a distance between chucks of 50 mm and a<br>
tensile speed of 100 mm/min. The electrolysis was<br>
performed in the above described electrolysis cell in<br>
which a film (y) was arranged so as to face an anode at<br>
a current density of 60 A/dm2 and a temperature set at<br>
90°C for seven days. Electrolysis voltage, current<br>
efficiency and an amount of sodium chloride in produced<br>
caustic soda were measured, and electrolysis stability<br>
was evaluated from respective values measured on the<br>
second day and the seventh day after electrolysis has<br>
been started. The amount of sodium chloride in the<br>
produced caustic soda (NaCl/50%-NaOH) was determined<br>
by: obtaining a value measured by the steps of reacting<br>
chloride ions of sodium chloride in the caustic soda<br>
with mercury thiocyanate to isolate thiocyanate ions,<br>
reacting the thiocyanate ions with iron (III) ions to<br>
form thiocyanate iron (III), and measuring the<br>
intensity of coloration due to the thiocyanate iron<br>
(III); and converting the value to the case in which a<br>
caustic soda solution concentration was 50% by weight.<br>
[0055]<br>
The results are shown in Table 1 together<br>
with the results of other examples and comparative<br>
examples. The membrane showed the values of tensile<br>
strength and tensile elongation sufficiently tolerable<br>
for the electrolysis. The membrane also showed a small<br>
degradation of electrolysis performance on the second<br>
day after the initiation of electrolysis and the<br>
seventh day, an ultratrace amount of sodium chloride<br>
contained in caustic soda, no remarkable increase even<br>
on the seventh day after the initiation of<br>
electrolysis, and consequently stable electrolysis<br>
performance.<br>
[0056]<br>
Example 2<br>
A release paper was embossed by a resinous<br>
pressure roll at a line pressure of 800 N/cm. A<br>
composite membrane was prepared with the same method as<br>
Example 1 so that the projecting parts made from a<br>
polymer having an ion-exchange group formed on the<br>
surface of an anode side could show the height of about<br>
33 µm by an average value h, be distributed at a<br>
density P of 500 pieces/cm2, have such bottom faces as<br>
to occupy about 0.025 cm2/cm2 by an average value S of<br>
area fraction, have such top parts as to occupy about<br>
0.012 cm2/cm2 by an average value T of area fraction,<br>
have bottom sides with the length of about 80 µm by an<br>
average value a, and have a width of about 67 µm by an<br>
average value b at the half height of the projecting<br>
part. At this time, a value of b/a was about 0.84 and<br>
a value of h/a was about 0.41. The obtained composite<br>
membrane was subjected to electrolysis on the same<br>
conditions as in Example 1. The results are shown in<br>
Table 1 in the same way. The Example 2 showed adequate<br>
results similar to the case of Example 1.<br>
[0057]<br>

(projecting parts) on the surface was prepared, which<br>
had a quadrangular pyramid shape, an average height of<br>
150 µm, a distribution density of about 250 pieces/cm2,<br>
an area fraction of the bottom faces of 0.4 cm2/cm2, a<br>
length of the bottom sides of 400 µm, and a width of<br>
225 µm at the half height of the protruding part, and<br>
was heated to 40°C; and an embossed shape was formed on<br>
a release paper with a basis weight of 127 g/m2 by<br>
crimping the release paper with the heated metallic<br>
roll and a resinous pressure roll at a line pressure of<br>
1,100 N/cm for the resinous pressure roll at a<br>
embossing speed of 10 m/min. A composite membrane was<br>
made by using the release paper with the same method as<br>
in Example 1.<br>
[0058]<br>
It was confirmed that the obtained composite<br>
membrane made from a polymer having an ion-exchange<br>
group had the projecting parts formed on the surface of<br>
an anode side, which had the height of about 66 µm by<br>
an average value h, were distributed at a density P of<br>
250 pieces/cm2, had such bottom faces as to occupy about<br>
0.1 cm2/cm2 by an average value S of area fraction, had<br>
such top parts as to occupy about 0.009 cm2/cm2 by an<br>
average value T of area fraction, had bottom sides with<br>
the length of about 200 µm by an average value a, and<br>
had a width of about 125 µm by an average value b at<br>
the half height of the projecting part. At this time,<br>
the value of b/a was about 0.63 and the value of h/a<br>
was about 0.33. The obtained composite membrane was<br>
subjected to electrolysis on the same conditions as in<br>
Example 1. The results are shown in Table 1 in the<br>
same way. The Example 3 showed adequate results<br>
similar to the case of Example 1.<br>
[0059]<br>
Example 4<br>
A release paper was embossed at a line<br>
pressure of 1400 N/cm for a resinous pressure roll. A<br>
composite membrane was prepared with the same method as<br>
Example 3 so that the projecting parts made from only a<br>
polymer having an ion-exchange group formed on the<br>
surface of an anode side showed the height of about 95<br>
µm by an average value h, were distributed at a density<br>
P of 250 pieces/cm2, had such bottom faces as to occupy<br>
about 0.18 cm2/cm2 by an average value S of area<br>
fraction, had such top parts as to occupy about 0.009<br>
cm2/cm2 by an average value T of area fraction, had<br>
bottom sides with the length of about 270 µm by an<br>

membrane was subjected to electrolysis on the same<br>
conditions as in Example 1. The results are shown in<br>
Table 1 in the same way. The Example 4 showed adequate<br>
results similar to the case of Example 1.<br>
[0060]<br>
Comparative Example 1<br>
A composite membrane was prepared by using a<br>
release paper that had not been embossed with the same<br>
method as in Example 1 and evaluated. As a result of<br>
having observed the surface of an anode side, there was<br>
not such a projecting part as seen in Examples. The<br>
result is shown in Table 1. The Comparative Example 1<br>
showed adequate mechanical strength which was confirmed<br>
in a tensile test, but showed a large degradation of<br>
current efficiency among electrolysis performances, and<br>
showed a large amount of sodium chloride in caustic<br>
soda even on the second day after initial electrolysis,<br>
and a remarkably increased amount of the sodium<br>
chloride on the seventh day.<br>
[0061]<br>

A release paper was embossed at a line<br>
pressure of 400 N/cm for a resinous pressure roll. A<br>
composite membrane was prepared with the same method as<br>
Example 3 so that the projecting parts made from a<br>
polymer having an ion-exchange group formed on the<br>
surface of an anode side showed the height of about 16<br>
µm by an average value h, were distributed at a density<br>
P of 250 pieces/cm2, had such bottom faces as to occupy<br>
about 0.019 cm2/cm2 by an average value S of area<br>
fraction, had such top parts as to occupy about 0.009<br>
cm2/cm2 by an average value T of area fraction, had<br>
bottom sides with the length of about 87 µm by an<br>
average value a, and have a width of about 46 µm by an<br>
average value b at the half height of the projecting<br>
part. At this time, a value of b/a was about 0.53 and<br>
a value of h/a was about 0.18. The obtained composite<br>
membrane was subjected to electrolysis on the same<br>
conditions as in Example 1. Results are shown in Table<br>
1 in the same way. Similarly to Comparative Example 1,<br>
Comparative Example 2 showed adequate mechanical<br>
strength, but showed a large degradation of current<br>
efficiency among electrolysis performances, and showed<br>
a large amount of sodium chloride in caustic soda even<br>
on the second day after initial electrolysis.<br>
[0062]<br>
Comparative Example 3<br>
A release paper was embossed at a line<br>
pressure of 400 N/cm for a resinous pressure roll. A<br>
composite membrane was prepared with the same method as<br>
Example 1 so that the projecting parts made from a<br>
polymer having an ion-exchange group formed on the<br>
surface of an anode side showed the height of about 15<br>
µm by an average value h, were distributed at a density<br>
P of 500 pieces/cm2, had such bottom faces as to occupy<br>
about 0.017 cm2/cm2 by an average value S of area<br>
fraction, had such top parts as to occupy about 0.012<br>
cm2/cm2 by an average value T of area fraction, had<br>
bottom sides with the length of about 65 µm by an<br>
average value a, and have a width of about 35 µm by an<br>
average value b at the half height of the projecting<br>
part. At this time, a value of b/a was about 0.54 and<br>
a value of h/a was about 0.23. The obtained composite<br>
membrane was subjected to electrolysis on the same<br>
conditions as in Example 1. The result is shown in<br>
Table 1. The Comparative Example 3 also showed<br>
adequate mechanical strength, but showed a large<br>
degradation of current efficiency among electrolysis<br>
performances, and showed a large amount of sodium<br>
chloride in caustic soda even on the second day after<br>
initial electrolysis.<br>
