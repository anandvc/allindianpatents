TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
This invention relates to novel piper dine derivatives useful as monoamine neurotransmitter re-uptake inhibitors.<br>
In other aspects the invention relates to the use of these compounds in a method for therapy and to pharmaceutical compositions comprising the compounds of f the invention.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Petukhov et ai [Petukhov P A, Zhang J, Kozikowski A P, Wang CZ,YeYP, s Johnson KM and Telia S Rl; J. Med. Chem. 2002 45 3161-3170] describe SAR studies of piperidine-based analogues of cocaine.<br>
WO 00/20390 (Georgetown University) describes monomeric and dimeric heterocycles and therapeutic uses thereof.<br>
WO 98/51668 (NeuroSearch A/S) describes 3-alkoxyimidomethyl-piperidine i derivatives active as neurotransmitter re-uptake inhibitors. Examples 1 and 2 describe two intermediate mixtures, (±)-cis/trans-1-methyl-3-methoxycarbonyl-4~(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-piperidine and (±)-cis/trans-1-methyl-3-hydroxymethyI-4-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-piperidine. No pharmacological use of these two intermediate mixtures is disclosed.<br>
However, there is a continued strong need to find compounds with an optimised biochemical profile as regards the activity on reuptake of the monoamine neurotransmitters serotonin, dopamine and noradrenaline, such as the ratio of the serotonin reuptake versus the noradrenaline and dopamine activity.<br>
Furthermore, there is a strong need to find effective compounds, which structurally and synthetically wise are unrelated to cocaine.<br>

Such pharmaceutical compositions and unit dosage forms thereof may comprise conventional ingredients in conventional proportions, with or without additional active compounds or principles, and such unit dosage forms may contain any suitable effective amount of the active ingredient commensurate with the intended daily dosage range to be employed.<br>
The chemical compound of the present invention can be administered in a wide variety of oral and parenteral dosage forms. It will be obvious to those skilled in the art that the following dosage forms may comprise, as the active component, either a chemical compound of the invention or a pharmceutically acceptable salt of a chemical compound of the invention.<br>
For preparing pharmaceutical compositions from a chemical compound of the present invention, pharmceutically acceptable carriers can be either solid or liquid. Solid form preparations include powders, tablets, pills, capsules, cachets, suppositories, and dispersible granules. A solid carrier can be one or more substances which may also act as diluents, flavouring agents, solubilizers, lubricants, suspending agents, binders, preservatives, tablet disintegrating agents, or an encapsulating material.<br>
In powders, the carrier is a finely divided solid, which is in a mixture with the finely divided active component<br>
In tablets, the active component is mixed with the carrier having the necessary binding capacity in suitable proportions and compacted in the shape and size desired.<br>
The powders and tablets preferably contain from five or ten to about seventy percent of the active compound. Suitable carriers are magnesium carbonate, magnesium stearate, talc, sugar, lactose, pectin, dextrin, starch, gelatin, tragacanth, methylcellulose, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, a low melting wax, cocoa butter, and the like. The term "preparation" is intended to include the formulation of the active compound with encapsulating material as carrier providing a capsule in which the active component, with or without carriers, is surrounded by a carrier, which is thus in association with it. Similarly, cachets and lozenges are included. Tablets, powders, capsules, pills, cachets, and lozenges can be used as solid forms suitable for oral administration.<br>
For preparing suppositories, a low melting wax, such as a mixture of fatty acid glyceride or cocoa butter, is first melted and the active component is dispersed<br><br>
homogeneously therein, as by stirring. The molten homogenous mixture is then poured into convenient sized moulds, allowed to cool, and thereby to solidify.<br>
Compositions suitable for vaginal administration may be presented as pessaries, tampons, creams, gels, pastes, foams or sprays containing in addition to the active ingredient such carriers as are known in the art to be appropriate.<br>
Liquid preparations include solutions, suspensions, and emulsions, for example, water or water-propylene glycol solutions. For example, parenteral injection liquid preparations can be formulated as solutions in aqueous polyethylene glycol solution.<br>
The chemical compound according to the present invention may thus be formulated for parenteral administration (e.g. by injection, for example bolus injection or continuous infusion) and may be presented in unit dose form in ampoules, pre-filled syringes, small volume infusion or in multi-dose containers with an added preservative. The compositions may take such forms as suspensions, solutions, or emulsions in oily or aqueous vehicles, and may contain formulation agents such as suspending, stabilising and/or dispersing agents. Alternatively, the active ingredient may be in powder form, obtained by aseptic isolation of sterile solid or by lyophilization from solution, for constitution with a suitable vehicle, e.g. sterile, pyrogen-free water, before use.<br>
Aqueous solutions suitable for oral use can be prepared by dissolving the active component in water and adding suitable colorants, flavours, stabilising and thickening agents, as desired.<br>
Aqueous suspensions suitable for oral use can be made by dispersing the finely divided active component in water with viscous material, such as natural or synthetic gums, resins, methylcellulose, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, or other well known suspending agents.<br>
Also included are solid form preparations, intended for conversion shortly before use to liquid form preparations for oral administration. Such liquid forms include solutions, suspensions, and emulsions. In addition to the active component such preparations may comprise colorants, flavours, stabilisers, buffers, artificial and natural sweeteners, dispersants, thickeners, solubilizing agents, and the like.<br>
For topical administration to the epidermis the chemical compound of the invention may be formulated as ointments, creams or lotions, or as a transdermal patch. Ointments and creams may, for example, be formulated with an aqueous or oily base with the addition of suitable thickening and/or gelling agents. Lotions may be formulated with an aqueous or oily base and will in general also contain one or more emulsifying agents, stabilising agents, dispersing agents, suspending agents, thickening agents, or colouring agents.<br>
Compositions suitable for topical administration in the mouth include lozenges comprising the active agent in a flavoured base, usually sucrose and acacia or tragacanth; pastilles comprising the active ingredient in an inert base such as gelatin and<br><br>
glycerine or sucrose and acacia; and mouthwashes comprising the active ingredient in a suitable liquid carrier.<br>
Solutions or suspensions are applied directly to the nasal cavity by conventional means, for example with a dropper, pipette or spray. The compositions may be provided in single or multi-dose form.<br>
Administration to the respiratory tract may also be achieved by means of an aerosol formulation In which the active ingredient is provided in a pressurised pack with a suitable propellant such as a chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) for example dichlorodifluoromethane, trichlorofluoromethane, or dichlorotetrafluoroethane, carbon dioxide, or other suitable gas. The aerosol may conveniently also contain a surfactant such as lecithin. The dose of drug may be controlled by provision of a metered valve.<br>
Alternatively the active ingredients may be provided in the form of a dry powder, for example a powder mix of the compound in a suitable powder base such as lactose, starch, starch derivatives such as hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP). Conveniently the powder carrier will form a gel in the nasal cavity. The powder composition may be presented in unit dose form for example in capsules or cartridges of, e.g., gelatin, or blister packs from which the powder may be administered by means of an inhaler.<br>
In compositions intended for administration to the respiratory tract, including intranasal compositions, the compound will generally have a small particle size for example of the order of 5 microns or less. Such a particle size may be obtained by means known in the art, for example by micronization.<br>
When desired, compositions adapted to give sustained release of the active ingredient may be employed.<br>
The pharmaceutical preparations are preferably in unit dosage forms. In such form, the preparation is subdivided into unit doses containing appropriate quantities of the active component. The unit dosage form can be a packaged preparation, the package containing discrete quantities of preparation, such as packaged tablets, capsules, and powdersJn vials or ampoules. Also, the unit dosage form can be a capsule, tablet, cachet, or lozenge itself, or it can be the appropriate number of any of these in packaged form.<br>
Tablets or capsules for oral administration and liquids for intravenous administration and continuous infusion are preferred compositions.<br>
Further details on techniques for formulation and administration may be found in the latest edition of Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences (Maack Publishing Co., Easton, PA).<br>
A therapeutically effective dose refers to that amount of active ingredient, which ameliorates the symptoms or condition. Therapeutic efficacy and toxicity, e.g. ED50 and LD50, may be determined by standard pharmacological procedures in cell cultures or<br><br>
experimental animals. The dose ratio between therapeutic and toxic effects is the therapeutic index and may be expressed by the ratio LD50/ED50. Pharmaceutical compositions exhibiting large therapeutic indexes are preferred.<br>
The dose administered must of course be carefully adjusted to the age, weight and condition of the individual being treated, as well as the route of administration, dosage form and regimen, and the result desired, and the exact dosage should of course be determined by the practitioner.<br>
The actual dosage depend on the nature and severity of the disease being treated, and is within the discretion of the physician, and may be varied by titration of the dosage to the particular circumstances of this invention to produce the desired therapeutic effect. However, it is presently contemplated that pharmaceutical compositions containing of from about 0.1 to about 500 mg of active ingredient per individual dose, preferably of from about 1 to about 100 mg, most preferred of from about 1 to about 10 mg, are suitable for therapeutic treatments.<br>
The active ingredient may be administered in one or several doses per day. A satisfactory result can, in certain instances, be obtained at a dosage as low as 0.1 Mg/kg i.v. and 1 |xg/kg p.o. The upper limit of the dosage range is presently considered to be about 10 mg/kg i.v. and 100 mg/kg p.o. Preferred ranges are from about 0.1 ng/kg to about 10 mg/kg/day i.v., and from about 1 jig/kg to about 100 mg/kg/day p.o.<br>
Methods of Therapy<br>
In another aspect the invention provides a method for the treatment, prevention or alleviation of a disease or a disorder or a condition of a living animal body, including a human, which disease, disorder or condition is responsive to inhibition of monoamine neurotransmitter re-uptake in the central nervous system, and which method comprises administering to such a living animal body, including a human, in need thereof an effective amount of a chemical compound of the invention.<br>
It is at present contemplated that suitable dosage ranges are 0.1 to 1000 milligrams daily, 10-500 milligrams daily, and especially 30-100 milligrams daily, dependent as usual upon the exact mode of administration, form in which administered, the indication toward which the administration is directed, the subject involved and the body weight of the subject involved, and further the preference and experience of the physician or veterinarian in charge.<br>
