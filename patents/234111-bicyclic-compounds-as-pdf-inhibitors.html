BICYCLIC COMPOUNDS AND COMPOSITIONS AS<br>
PDF INHIBITORS<br>
CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
This application claims the benefit of priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application Number 60/491,765, filed 31 July 2003. The full disclosure of this application is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety and for all purposes.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
This invention is directed to novel bicyclic compounds, to the uses of these compounds in various medicinal applications, including treating disorders amenable to treatment by peptide deformylase inhibitors such as treatment of bacterial infections, and to pharmaceutical compositions comprising of these compounds.<br>
Background<br>
Treatment of microbial infection in host organisms requires an effective means to kill the microbe while doing as little harm to the host as possible. Accordingly, agents that target characteristics unique to a pathology-causing microorganism are desirable for treatment. Penicillin is an extremely well known example of such an agent. Penicillin acts by inhibiting biosynthesis of bacterial cell walls. Since mammalian cells do not require cell walls for survival, administration of penicillin to a human infected with bacteria may kill the bacteria without killing human cells. However, the use of antibiotics and antimicrobials has also resulted in increased resistance to these agents. As bacteria become resistant to older, more widely used antimicrobial agents, new antimicrobials must be developed in order to provide effective treatments for human and non-human animals suffering from microbial infection.<br><br>
Peptide defortnylase is a metallopeptidase found in prokaryotic organisms such as bacteria. Protein synthesis in prokaryotic organisms begins with N-formyl methionine (fMet). After initiation of protein synthesis, the formyl group is removed by the enzyme peptide deformylase (PDF); this activity is essential for maturation of proteins. It has been shown that PDF is required for bacterial growth (Chang et aL, J. BacterioL, Vol. 171, pp. 4071-4072 (1989); Meinnel et aL, J. BacterioL, Vol 176, No. 23, pp. 7387-7390 (1994); Mazel et aL, EMBO J., Vol. 13, No. 4, pp. 914-23 (1994)). Since protein synthesis in eukaryotic organisms does not depend on Met for initiation, agents that inhibit PDF are attractive candidates for development of new antimicrobial and antibacterial drugs. Prokaryotic organisms, including disease-causing prokaryotes, are described in Balows A, Truper HG, Dworkin M, Harder W and Schleifer K-H (eds.),'The Prokaryotes", 2nd ed., New York: Springer-Verlag Q. (1992); and Holt JG (Editor-in-chief), "Bergey &amp; Apos, S., Manual of Systematic Bacteriology", Vols. 1-4, Baltimore: WiUiams &amp; Wilkins (1982,1986,1989).<br>
PDF is part of the metalloproteinase superfamily. While PDF shares many of the features that characterize metalloproteinases, PDF differs from other members of the superfamily in its secondary/tertiary structure and the metal ions that are coordinated in the active site. Metalloproteinases are critical to many aspects of normal metabolism. The class known as matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are involved in tissue remodeling, such as degradation of the extracellular matrix. These enzymes are believed to play a role in normal or beneficial biological events such as the formation of the corpus luteum during pregnancy (see Liu et aL, Endocrinology, Vol. 140, No. 11, pp. 5330-5338 (1999)), wound healing (Yamagiwa et al., Bone, Vol. 25, No. 2, pp. 197-203 (1999)), and bone growth in healthy children (Bord et al., Bone, Vol. 23, No. 1, pp. 7-12 (1998)). Disorders involving metalloproteinases have been implicated in several diseases such as cancer, arthritis and autoimmune diseases. Because of the importance of MMPs in normal physiological processes, it would be preferable to develop agents that inhibit PDF, a metalloproteinase present only in prokaryotes, while avoiding significant inhibition of MMPs. Alternatively, PDF inhibitors that also inhibit MMPs may be of use where the therapeutic benefits of inhibiting PDF outweighs the risk of side effects from MMP inhibition.<br><br>
While a wide variety of compounds have been developed as candidate inhibitors of MMPs and other metalloproteinases, research on inhibitors of PDF is much less extensive. In view of the importance of identifying new antibiotics to treat bacteria resistant to existing antibiotics, it is desirable to develop novel inhibitors of PDF for evaluation and use as antibacterial and antimicrobial agents. The present invention fulfills this need.<br>

Preferred compounds of the invention are shown in table 1, infra.<br>
The invention provides forms of the compound that have the hydroxyl or amine group present in a protected form; these function as prodrugs. Prodrugs are compounds that are converted into an active drug form aiier administration, through one or more chemical or biochemical transformations. The antibacterial potency of compounds that axe potent inhibitors of the PDF enzyme in vitro, but penetrate the cell wall poorly, can be improved by their use in the form of a prodrug that is converted to the parent molecule after passing through the cell wall. Forms of the compounds of the present invention that are readily converted into the claimed compound under physiological conditions are prodrugs of the claimed compounds and are within the scope of the present invention. Examples of prodrugs include forms where a hydroxyl group is acylated to form a relatively labile ester such as an acetate ester, and forms where an amine group is acylated with the carboxylate group of glycine or an L-amino acid such as serine, forming an amide bond that is particularly susceptible to hydrolysis by common metabolic enzymes.<br><br>
Compounds of Formula I can exist in free form or in salt form, e.g. addition salts with inorganic or organic acids. Where hydroxyl groups are present, these groups can also be present in salt form, e.g. an ammonium salt or salts with metals such as lithium, sodium, potassium, calcium, zinc or magnesium, or a mixture thereof. Compounds of Formula I and their salts in hydrate or solvate form are also part of the invention.<br>
When the compounds of Formula I have asymmetric centers in the molecule, various optical isomers are obtained. The present invention also encompasses enantiomers, racemates, diastereoisomers and mixtures thereof. Moreover, when the compounds of Formula I include geometric isomers, the present invention embraces cis-compounds, trans-compounds and mixtures thereof. Similar considerations apply in relation to starting materials exhibiting asymmetric carbon atoms or unsaturated bonds as mentioned above.<br>
Methods for Preparing Antibacterial Compounds<br>
The present invention also includes processes for the preparation of antibacterial compounds of the invention. In the reactions described, it can be necessary to protect reactive functional groups, for example hydroxy, amino, imino, thio or carboxy groups, where these are desired in the final product, to avoid their unwanted participation in the reactions. Conventional protecting groups can be used in accordance with standard practice, for example, see T.W. Greene and P. G. M. Wuts in "Protective Groups in Organic Chemistry, John Wiley and Sons, 1991.<br>
Compounds of Formula I can be prepared by proceeding as in the following reaction scheme 1:<br><br><br>
in which n, Z, Ri, R2 and R3 are as defined for Formula I, above. Y is a halogen, or the like. The reaction can proceed in the presence of a suitable base (e.g., NaH, LDA or the like) in a suitable solvent (e.g., DMF, THF, DMSO or the like) at a temperature of about 25°C and can take up to 12 hours to complete.<br>
Additional Processes for Preparing Compounds of the Invention:<br>
A compound of the invention can be prepared as apharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt by reacting the free base form of the compound with a pharmaceutically acceptable inorganic or organic acid. Alternatively, a pharmaceutically acceptable base addition salt of a compound of the invention can be prepared by reacting the free acid form of the compound with a pharmaceutically acceptable inorganic or organic base. Alternatively, the salt forms of the compounds of the invention can be prepared using salts of the starting materials or intermediates.<br>
The free acid or free base forms of the compounds of the invention can be prepared from the corresponding base addition salt or acid addition salt from, respectively. For example a compound of the invention in an acid addition salt form can be converted to the corresponding free base by treating with a suitable base (e.g., ammonium hydroxide solution, sodium hydroxide, and the like). A compound of the invention in a base addition<br><br>
salt form can be converted to the corresponding free acid by treating wife a suitable acid (e.g., hydrochloric acid, etc.).<br>
Compounds of the invention in unoxidized form can be prepared from N-oxides of compounds of the invention by treating with a reducing agent (e.g., sulfur, sulfur dioxide, triphenyl phosphine, lithium borohydride, sodium borohydride, phosphorus trichloride, tribromide, or fee like) in a suitable inert organic solvent (e.g. acetonitrile, ethanol, aqueous dioxane, or fee like) at 0 to 80°C.<br>
Prodrug derivatives of fee compounds of the invention can be prepared by methods known to those of ordinary skill in fee art (e.g., for further details see Saulnier et aL, (1994), Bioorganic and Medicinal Chemistry Letters, Vol. 4, p. 1985). For example, appropriate prodrugs can be prepared by reacting a non-derivatized compound of fee invention with a suitable carbamylating agent (e.g., 1,1-acyloxyalkylcarbanochloridate, para-nitrophenyl caibonate, or fee like).<br>
Protected derivatives of the compounds of fee invention can be made by means known to those of ordinary skill in the art. A detailed description of techniques applicable to fee creation of protecting groups and their removal can be found in T W. Greene, "Protecting Groups in Organic Chemistry", 3rd edition, John Wiley and Sons, Inc., 1999.<br>
Compounds of fee present invention can be conveniently prepared, or formed during fee process of fee invention, as solvates (e.g., hydrates).  Hydrates of compounds of fee present invention can be conveniently prepared by recrystallization from an aqueous/organic solvent mixture, using organic solvents such as dioxin, tetrahydrofuran or methanol.<br>
Compounds of fee invention can be prepared as their individual stereoisomers by reacting a racemic mixture of the compound wife an optically active resolving agent to forma pair of diastereoisomeric compounds, separating the diastereomers and recovering the optically pure enantiomers. While resolution of enantiomers can be carried out using covalent diastereomeric derivatives of fee compounds of fee invention, dissociable complexes are preferred (e.g., crystalline diastereomeric salts). Diastereomers have distinct physical properties (e.g., melting points, boiling points, solubilities, reactivity, etc.) and can be readily separated by taking advantage of these dissimilarities.  The diastereomers can be separated by chromatography, or preferable, by separation/resolution techniques based upon<br><br>
differences in solubility. The optically pure enantiomer is then recovered, along with the resolving agent, by any practical means that would not result in racemization. A more detailed description of the techniques applicable to the resolution of stereoisomers of compounds from the their racemic mixture can be found in Jean Jacques, Andre Collet, Samuel H. Wilen, "Enantiomers, Racemates and Resolutions", John Wiley And Sons, Inc., 1981.<br>

The compounds of the invention, e. g. the compounds of formula I in free form or inpharmaceutically acceptable salt form or a prodrug thereof exhibit valuable 5     pharmacological properties, e.g. as anti-infectious agents, e.g. as indicated by the in vitro test given in Example 3 and are therefore indicated for therapy.<br><br>
Example 14<br>
Inhibition of Peptide Defonnvlase Activity<br>
PDF assays with the S.aureaus enzyme are performed in duplicate according to Clements et al. (Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2001, 45, 563-570) using f-Met-Ala-Ser (f-MAS) as substrate and detecting the free amino group of the PDF product MAS with fluorescamine. Assays are performed in 384 well plates with a final well volume of 50^1 containing 5 nM PDF, 2mM f-MAS, 80mM HEPES (pH7.4), 0.7M KC1, ImM NiCl2, 0.135% Brij35, and 1.25mM TCEP. The reaction mix is incubated for 30 minutes with various concentrations of the inhibitor at room temperature and the free amino group of the substrate MAS is detected by the addition of 25|al of 0.2 mg/ml fluorescamine in acetonitrile. Fluorescence is quantified with an Acquest plate reader using an excitation wavelength of 388nm and an emission wavelength of 445nm. Assay controls of plus or minus enzyme provide the 0 and 100 % inhibition values, respectively. Analysis of the data is done by conversion of the fluorescence units to percent inhibition and the data is plotted against percent inhibition. The concentration (nanomolar) of inhibitor required to decrease enzyme activity by 50% (IC50) is determined from a dose response curve.<br>
The compounds of Formula I in free form or in pharmaceutical^ acceptable salt<br>
form, exhibit valuable pharmacological properties, e.g. antibacterial properties, for example,<br>
as indicated by the in vitro tests of Example 4 and are therefore indicated for therapy. The<br>

Treating a subject includes, but is not limited to, preventing, reducing, and/or eliininating the clinical symptoms caused by an infection of a subject by a microorganism; preventing, reducing, and/or eliminating an infection of a subject by a microorganism; or preventing, reducing, and/or eliminating contamination of a subject by a microorganism. The microorganism involved is preferably a prokaryote, more preferably a bacterium.<br><br>
For the above uses the required dosage will of course vary depending on the mode of administration, the particular condition to be treated and the effect desired. The compositions may contain, for example, from about 0.1% by weight to about 99% by weight, e. g. from about 10-60% by weight, of the active material, depending on the method of administration.<br>
Where the compositions comprise dosage units, each unit will contain, for example, from about 1-1000 mg, e.g. 1-500 mg, of the active ingredient. The dosage as employed for adult human treatment will range, for example, from about 1-3000 mg per day, for instance 1500 mg per day depending on the route and frequency of administration. Such a dosage corresponds to about 0.015-50 mg/kg per day. Suitably the dosage is, for example, from about 5-20 mg/kg per day. Suitable unit dosage forms for oral administration comprise ca. 0,25-1500 mg active ingredient<br>
The compounds of Formula I can be administered by any conventional route, e.g. locally or systemically e.g. orally, topically, parenterally, subdermally or by inhalation and may be used for the treatment of bacterial infection in a subject such as animals, preferably, mammals, more preferably, humans.<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions comprising a compound of Formula I in free form or in pharmaceutical^ acceptable salt form in association with at least one pharmaceutical acceptable carrier or diluent can be manufactured in conventional manner by mixing with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent. A "pharmaceutically acceptable carrier" means an excipient that is useful in preparing a pharmaceutical composition that is generally safe, non-toxic and neither biologically nor otherwise undesirable, and includes an excipient that is acceptable for veterinary use as well as human pharmaceutical use. A "pharmaceutically acceptable carriers used in the specification and claims includes both one and more than one such carriers.<br>

The compositions may be in any form known in the art, including but not limited to tablets, capsules, wafers, fast melts (without wafers), powders, granules, lozenges, creams or liquid preparations, such as oral or sterile parenteral solutions or suspensions. The compounds may also be administered in liposomal, micellar or emulsion formulations. The compounds may also be administered as prodrugs, where the prodrug administered undergoes biotransformation in the treated mammal to a form that is biologically active.<br>
The topical formulations of the present invention may be presented as, for instance, ointments, creams or lotions, solutions, salves, emulsions, plasters, eye ointments and eye or ear drops, impregnated dressings, transdermal patches, sprays and aerosols, and may contain appropriate conventional additives such as preservatives, solvents to assist drug penetration and emollient in ointments and creams.<br>
The formulations may also contain compatible conventional carriers, such as cream or ointment bases and ethanol or oleyl alcohol for lotions. Such carriers may be present, for example, from about 1 % up to about 99% of the formulation. For example, they may form up to about 80% of the formulation.<br>
Tablets and capsules for oral administration may be in unit dose presentation form, and may contain conventional excipients such as binding agents, for example, syrup, acacia, gelatin, sorbitol, tragacanth, or polyvinylpyrollidone; fillers, for example, lactose, sugar, maize-starch, calcium phosphate, sorbitol or glycine; tabletting lubricants, for example, magnesium stearate, talc, polyethylene glycol or silica; disintegrants, for example, potato starch; or acceptable wetting agents, such as sodium lauryl sulphate. The tablets may be coated according to methods well-know in standard pharmaceutical practice.<br>
Oral liquid preparations may be in the form of, for example, aqueous or oily suspensions, solutions, emulsions, syrups or elixirs, or may be presented as a dry product for reconstitution with water or another suitable vehicle before use. Such liquid preparations may contain conventional additives, such as suspending agents, for example, sorbitol, methyl cellulose, glucose syrup, gelatin, hydroxyethyl cellulose, carboxymethyl cellulose, aluminium stearate gel or hydrogenated edible fats; emulsifying agents, for example, lecithin, sorbitan monooleate or acacia; non-aqueous vehicles (which may include edible oils), for example, almond oil, oily esters such as glycerine, propylene glycol, or ethyl<br><br>
alcohol; preservatives, for example, methyl or propyl p-hydroxybenzoate or sorbic acid, and, if desired, conventional flavoring or coloring agents.<br>
For parenteral administration, fluid unit dosage forms are prepared utilizing the compound and a sterile vehicle, water being preferred. The compound, depending on the vehicle and concentration used, may be either suspended or dissolved in the vehicle or other suitable solvent. In preparing solutions, the compound may be dissolved in water for injection and filter sterilized before filling into a suitable vial or ampule and sealing. Advantageously, agents such as a local anesthetic preservative and buffering agents may be dissolved in the vehicle. To enhance the stability, the composition may be frozen after filling into the vial and the water removed under vacuum. The dry lyophilized powder is then sealed in the vial and an accompanying vial of water for injection may be supplied to reconstitute the liquid prior to use. Parenteral suspensions are prepared in substantially the same manner except that the compound is suspended in the vehicle instead of being dissolved and sterilization cannot be accomplished by filtration. The compound may be sterilized by exposure to ethylene oxide before suspending in the sterile vehicle. Advantageously, a surfactant or wetting agent is included in the composition to facilitate uniform distribution of the compound.<br>
