				<td>The invention relates to an arrangement at the outlet of a draw frame for detection of the fibre material, in which arrangement the composite fibre emerging from the outlet rollers of the drawing system, for example cotton, synthetic fibres and the like, passes through a web guide and a silver funnel, and the quality of the composite fibre can be evaluated.<br>
In practice, the quality of draw frame slivers is analysed with respect to the finished sliver. The quality of the sliver, especially the test criteria CV value of the uniformity of mass, the mixing ration and maintenance of the sliver count, is evaluated in the course of passage through the sliver funnel. In the process, statements, for example relating to sliver mass deviations, are possible only in respect of the sliver cross-section as a whole.<br>
The problem underlying the invention is accordingly to provide an arrangement of the type described at the beginning, that avoids the mentioned disadvantages, in particular permits more accurate detection and enables the evaluation of further features of the composite fibre and/or of the fibre material.<br>
The problem is solved by the characterizing features of the invention.<br>
As a result of the measures according to the invention, more accurate detection of the composite fibre is possible. In particular, the broader shape before<br>
compaction in the sliver funnel enables access to details by way of the image detection. A particular advantage is that, depending upon the resolution, detection is possible ranging from individual fibre evaluation (fibre stubs) via web imperfections, larger surface areas (cloudiness) to evaluation of the composite fibre as a whole, which consists of a plurality of slivers. The evaluated results of the image processing can be used for optimum adjustment of the machine.<br>
Claims 2 to 50 contain advantageous developments of the invention.<br>
The invention will be explained hereinafter in greater detail with reference to embodiments shown in the accompanying drawings, in which:<br>
Fig. 1 is a diagrammatic side view of a drawing system comprising the<br>
arrangement according to the invention between an outlet roller of the drawing system and an intake opening of the web guide,<br>
Fig. 2 shows a drawing system as in Fig. 1, wherein the arrangement<br>
according to the invention is associated with the web guide,<br>
Figs. 3a, 3b are a plan view, in section, and a front view, respectively, of the web guide, and<br>
Fig. 4 shows the drawing system according to Figs. 1 and 2 with a block<br>
diagram of an electronic control and regulating device and an arrangement according to the invention connected thereto.<br>
According to Fig. 1, a draw frame, for example a Trutzschler HSR draw frame, comprises a drawing system 1 having a drawing system intake and a drawing system outlet. The slivers 2, emerging from cans, enter a sliver guide and, drawn by delivery rollers, are conveyed past a measuring element (see Figure 5). The drawing system 1 is designed as a 4-over-3 drawing system, that is to say it consists of three lower rollers I, II, III (I lower outlet roller, II lower middle roller, III lower intake roller) and four upper rollers 3, 4, 5, 6. In the drawing system 1, the composite fibre 2 is drafted from a plurality of slivers. The draft comprises preliminary draft and main draft. The roller pairs 6/III and 5/II form the preliminary draft region and the roller pairs 5/II and 3,4/I form the main draft region. At the outlet of the drawing system, the drafted slivers (fibre web 14) enter a web guide 7 and by means of the delivery rollers 8, 9 are drawn through a sliver funnel 10, in which they are condensed to form a sliver 11, which is then deposited in cans (not shown) by way of a can coiler 12. A denotes the direction of movement of the composite fibre. Arranged between the outlet rollers 3/I of the drawing system 1 and the intake aperture 7a of the web guide 7 is a CCD camera (charge coupled device camera) as electronic camera 15, which is connected to an electronic evaluating device 16 (image processing unit), to which there is connected an electronic control and regulating device (see Figure 4).<br>
According to Fig. 2, in each of the cover surface (see Figure 3b) and base surface 7f of the web guide 7 there is an impermeable window 17 and 18, respectively. The CCD camera 15 and two light emitting diodes (LED) 19, 20 are<br>
arranged opposite the window 17 to the outside of and spaced from the cover surface 7e. A light emitting diode (LED) 21 is arranged opposite the window 18 to the outside of and spaced from the base surface 7f. In that manner, the fibre web 14 that has entered the interior 7" of the web guide 7 is detected optically between the intake opening 7a and the outlet opening 7b. The optical axis of the camera 15 is perpendicular to the direction of movement B of the fibre web 14. The cover and base surfaces 7e and 7f can be swung open; the images are taken through the windows 17 and 18. when the cover and base surfaces 7e, 7f are closed. As a result of the fact that light emitting diodes 19, 20 are located on the side on which the camera 15 is present and a light emitting diode 21 is located on the side of the web guide 7 remote from the camera 15, images can be taken in incident light and transmitted light. The images are taken both at delivery speed (900 m/min and more) and at increased and decreased speeds of the fibre web 14.<br>
According to Fig. 3a, the web guide 7 is in the shape of a funnel and has an open side 7a (intake-side opening) and a through opening 7b. The interior 7" of the web guide 7 is formed by two side surfaces 7c, 7d that converge in a relatively highly concave manner, and a cover surface 7e and base surface 7f, each of which is flat (see Figure 3b). The cover surface 7e and the base surface 7f can be swung open. The intake-side opening 7a is larger than the through opening 7b. Connected to the through opening 7b are transfer tubes 22 and 23 that convey the combined fibre web 14 into the sliver funnel 10 (see Figures 1 and 5) .<br>
In operation, the fibre web 14 emerging from the roller pair 3/1 passes through the intake opening 13a into the interior 13", strikes the inner surfaces 7c, is brought together by the inner surfaces and guided towards the outlet opening 7b. In the process, the fibre web 14 is compacted, with air being pressed out, the air escaping to the atmosphere through the intake opening 7a against the direction of movement B in the direction of arrows C and D.<br>
According to Fig. 4, the draw frame comprises the drawing system 1, upstream of which there is arranged a drawing system intake 24 and downstream of which there is arranged a drawing system outlet 25. The slivers 7"", drawn by delivery rollers 26, 27, are conveyed past a measuring element 28. In the drawing system 1, the composite fibre is drafted from a plurality of slivers. The draft comprises preliminary draft and main draft. The roller pairs 26/III and 25/II form the preliminary draft region and the roller pairs 25/II and 23, 24/I form the main draft region. In the drawing system outlet 25, the drafted slivers enter a web guide 7 and are drawn by means of the delivery rollers 8, 9 through a sliver funnel 10, in which they are condensed to form a sliver 11, which is then deposited in cans.<br>
The delivery rollers 15, 16, the lower intake roller III and the lower middle roller II, which are coupled mechanically, for example by a toothed belt, are driven by the variable speed motor 31, it being possible to preset a desired value. (The associated upper rollers 6 and 5 are entrained.) The lower outlet roller I and the delivery rollers 8, 9 are driven by the main motor 32. The variable speed motor 31 and the main motor 32 each have<br>
their own regulator 33 and 34, respectively. The regulation (speed regulation) is effected in each case<br>
by means of a closed control circuit, a tachometer generator 35 being associated with the variable speed<br>
motor and a tachometer generator 36 being associated with the main motor 32. At the drawing system intake 24, a value proportional to the mass, for example the cross-section of the slivers 14"" being fed in, is measured by the intake measuring element 28. At the drawing system outlet 25, the cross-section of the emerging sliver 11 is obtained by an outlet measuring element 37 associated with the sliver funnel 10. A central computing unit 38 (control and regulating device), for example a microcomputer with a microprocessor, transmits an adjustment of the desired value for the variable speed motor 31 to the regulator 33. The measurement values from the measuring element 28 are transmitted to the central computing unit 38 during the drafting process. The setting for the variable speed motor 31 is determined from the measurement values of the measuring element 28 and from the desired value for the cross-section of the emerging sliver 11. The measurement values from the outlet measuring element 37 are used to monitor the emerging sliver 11 (delivery sliver monitor-ing) . By means of that regulating system, deviations in the cross-section of the slivers 14 being fed in can be compensated for, or the sliver 11 can be rendered uniform, by appropriate regulations of the preliminary drafting process. 39 denotes an intake device and 16 represents diagrammatically the image processing device (see Figure 1). The camera 15 is connected to the electronic control and regulating device by way of the image processing device 16. In that manner, the results of the<br>
image analysis can be used in a closed control circuit to optimise the drafting process. The results of the image analysis of the fibre web 14 can be stored in a memory 47. According to the embodiment, images of the web 14 can be taken by means of the CCD camera 15. Images of the web 14 can also be taken by means of digitized photodiodes. Evaluation of the digital image information is effected online by image analysis software. The camera axis is preferably perpendicular to the web 14. The camera 15 can be moved along the inside frame width of the machine in order to take images across the working width of the draw frame. Advantageously, the camera 15 can be moved automatically away from the web 14 or the camera can be set on a wide-angle setting in order to take an image of all of the web width simultaneously. The camera 15 can also be arranged to swivel in order to take images across the working width of the draw frame. The web guide flaps 7e, 7f are transparent so that images of the web 14 can be taken when the web guide 7 is closed. The images are taken in incident light and transmitted light. For that purpose there are LEDs on the camera side and/or on the drawing system side. It is possible to take images of the web at delivery speed and at increased and decreased speeds. Advantageously, images are taken in the central region of the web in order to check the web for cloudiness. Reasons for that may be: poor guidance of short fibres, poor clamping of the web, incorrect drawing system settings. Moreover, images from that web region can be used to analyse the degree of parallelization of the fibres, the number and size of slubs, the structural influence of the material and any development of dust. With reference to all those influences, it is possible to determine the<br>
quality of the drafting process. Preferably, images are also taken especially from the edge region in order to be able to analyse guidance of the edge fibres in the draftinc process (complete or incomplete web image at the edges). As a result, it is also possible to determine whether there is streakiness across the working width (along the fibres) upon exit of the web. Streakiness arises because the slivers do not enter the drawing system correctly, that is to say slivers enter on top of one another or too far apart. By means of analysing the width of the web as a whole, it is also possible to evaluate the tensioned draft in that region. A further advantage is that the alignment of the slivers or fibres is analysed, since the number and position of skewed and straight-running slivers is a measure of the effective tensioned draft. The delivery roller tensioned draft is dependent upon the following parameters: delivery speed, draft, friction, sliver count, material, contamination etc.). The actual delivery roller tensioned draft is thus detected objectively. At the control system 38, images can be stored for fibre orientation at optimum tensioned draft. In particular, by means of a closed control circuit, the delivery roller tensioned draft can be optimised in targeted manner either fully automatically or semi-automatically (gear change by hand).<br>
All available line sensors, such as LED line cameras 15, X-ray and infrared lines, can be connected.<br>
The invention has been explained using the example of an autoleveller. Also included is a draw frame without autolevelling.<br>
