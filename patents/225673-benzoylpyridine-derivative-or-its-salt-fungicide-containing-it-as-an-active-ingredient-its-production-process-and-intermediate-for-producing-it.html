				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
BENZOYLPYRIDINE DERIVATIVE OR ITS SALT, FUNGICIDE<br>
CONTAINING IT AS AN ACTIVE INGREDIENT, ITS PRODUCTION<br>
PROCESS AND INTERMEDIATE FOR PRODUCING IT<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a novel<br>
benzoylpyridine derivative or its salt, a fungicide<br>
containing it as an active ingredient, its production<br>
process and an intermediate for producing it.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Benzoylpyridine derivatives which are analogous to<br>
the compounds of the present invention may be compounds<br>
as disclosed in e.g. WO99/41237, WO99/38845, WO96/17829,<br>
JP-A-7-309837 and JP-A-2-275858. However, they are<br>
different from the compounds of the present invention.<br>
Further, the purposes of use of these compounds are<br>
different from those of the compounds of the present<br>
invention.<br>
Many fungicides which have been conventionally<br>
provided have their own characteristics in their<br>
controlling effects over pests which cause plant<br>
diseases. Some have a slightly poorer curative effect as<br>
compared with a preventive effect, and some have a<br>
residual effect which lasts only for a relatively short<br>
period of time, so that their controlling effects against<br>
pests tend to be practically insufficient in some cases.<br>
Accordingly, it has been desired to develop a novel<br>
compound which has a strong controlling effect against<br>
pests which cause plant diseases.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present inventors have conducted extensive<br>
studies to overcome the above problems and as a result,<br>
have found that use of the compound represented by the<br>
formula (I) as an active ingredient presents excellent<br>
preventive effect and curative effect against various<br>
plant diseases, particularly powdery mildew of barley,<br>
vegetables, fruits and flowering plants, and the present<br>
invention has been accomplished.<br>

(wherein X is as defined above) to produce phenylpyridyl methanol<br>
represented by the formula (X1):<br>
(wherein X, n, p, R1 ,R2'and R2" are as defined above with a proviso as in<br>
formula (I')), and oxidizing it,<br>
The compound represented by the formula (I) or its<br>
salt may be produced in accordance with a known<br>
production process of an analogous compound (such as a<br>
process as disclosed in WO96/17829). However, as the<br>
preferred modes, Processes 1 to 3 as shown in the<br>
following schemes may be mentioned. Here', X, R1, R2, n<br>
and m in the formulae are as defined above. One of the<br>
substituents represented by M1 in the formula (II) and M2<br>
in the formula (III) is a cyano group, and the other is a<br>
metal atom or a composite salt thereof; the substituent<br>
represented by W in the formula (V) is a halogen atom or<br>

substituents represented by M3 in the formula (VI) and M4<br>
 in the formula (VII) is a formyl group, and the other is<br>
a metal atom or a composite salt thereof.<br>
Process 1<br>
A process for producing the compound represented by<br>
the formula (I), which comprises subjecting a compound<br>
represented by the formula (II) and a compound presented<br>
18<br>
by the formula (III) to a condensation reaction to<br>
produce an imine compound represented by the formula<br>
(VIII):<br><br>
wherein X, R1, R2, n and m are as defined above, and Z is<br>
a metal atom or a composite salt thereof, and hydrolyzing<br>
it.<br>
The metal atom represented by each of M1 and M2 in<br>
the formulae (II) and (III) may, for example, be a<br>
typical metal atom such as lithium, magnesium, zinc or<br>
copper; or a transition metal atom such as palladium or<br>
ruthenium. Further, a composite salt of a metal atom may<br>
be used instead of a metal atom.<br>
The compound of the formula (II) wherein M1 is a<br>
cyano group and the compound of the formula (III) wherein<br>
M2 is a cyano group may be produced in accordance with a<br>
known process such as a process as disclosed in Journal<br>
of the Chemical Society, Perkin transactions 1 pages<br>
2323-2326, 1999.<br>
The condensation reaction to produce an imine<br>
compound is carried out in the presence of a proper<br>
solvent (such as an inert solvent such as<br>
tetrahydrofuran, diethyl ether, dimethoxyethane, hexane,<br>
benzene, toluene or methylene chloride, or a mixed<br>
solvent thereof) at a reaction temperature of from -10 0<br>
to 70°C, preferably from -80 to 30°C. This reaction is<br>
carried out preferably in an inert gas atmosphere of e.g<br>
nitrogen or argon.<br>
The imine compound produced by the condensation<br>
reaction is hydrolyzed by a known procedure and converted<br>
into the compound represented by the formula (I). The<br>
hydrolysis reaction may be carried out in the presence of<br>
e.g. water, an alcohol or a mixture thereof. Here, in<br>
Process 1, the condensation reaction and the hydrolysis<br>
reaction are usually carried out continuously, and no<br>
imine compound is isolated. Further, to obtain the<br>
compound represented by the formula (I) with a high<br>
yield, it is preferred to carry out the hydrolysis<br>
reaction after the condensation reaction is completely<br>
conducted.<br>
Process 2<br>
A process for producing the compound represented by<br>
the formula (I), which comprises subjecting a compound<br>
represented by the formula (IV) and a compound<br>
represented by the formula (V) to a condensation reaction<br>
to produce a compound represented by the formula (IX):<br>
wherein X, R1, R2, n and m are as defined above, and<br>
subjecting it to decyanogenation oxidatively in the<br>
presence of a base.<br>
The reaction to produce the compound represented by<br>
the formula (IX) at the first half stage of Process 2 is<br>
carried out usually in the presence of a base preferably<br>
in a solvent. The base to be used for the reaction may,<br>
for example, be lithium hydride, sodium hydride, sodium<br>
methoxide, sodium ethoxide or potassium tert-butoxide.<br>
The solvent may, for example, be tetrahydrofuran, diethyl<br>
ether, benzene, toluene, methylene chloride, chloroform<br>
or DMF, or a mixed solvent thereof. This reaction is<br>
carried out preferably at a reaction temperature of from<br>
0 to 100°C. Further, it is carried out preferably in an<br>
inert gas atmosphere of e.g. nitrogen or argon. Further,<br>
sodium benzenesulfinate or sodium p-toluenesulfinate may<br>
be added as the case requires to accelerate the reaction.<br>
The oxidative decyanogenation reaction at the last<br>
half stage in Process 2 is carried out in the presence of<br>
a base. The base may, for example, be sodium hydride,<br>
potassium hydride, sodium carbonate or potassium<br>
carbonate. Further, a phase-transfer catalyst (such as<br>
benzyl triethylammonium chloride or tetrabutylammonium<br>
hydrogensulfate) may be used as the case requires. This<br>
reaction is usually carried out in a proper solvent (such<br>
as an inert solvent such as methylene chloride,<br>
chloroform, 1,2-dichloroethane, benzene, toluene, DMF or<br>
DMSO, or a water-containing solvent or a mixed solvent<br>
thereof) at a reaction temperature of from 0 to 50°C.<br>
Process 3<br>
A process for producing the compound represented by<br>
the formula (I), which comprises reacting a compound<br>
represented by the formula (VI) and a compound<br>
represented by the formula (VII) to produce phenylpyridyl<br>
methanol represented by the formula (X):<br>
 (wherein X, n, m, R1 and R2 are as defined above with a<br>
proviso as in formula (I)) and oxidizing it.<br>
Each of metal atoms represented by M3 and M4 in<br>
Process 3, may, for example, be a typical metal atom such<br>
as lithium, magnesium, zinc or copper; or a transition<br>
 metal atom such as palladium or ruthenium. Further, a<br>
composite salt of a metal atom may be used instead of a<br>
metal atom.<br>
The compound of the formula (VI) wherein the<br>
substituent represented by M3 is a formyl group and the<br>
compound of the formula (VII) wherein the substituent<br>
represented by M4 is a formyl group, may usually be<br>
produced in accordance with a known process such as a<br>
process as disclosed in Journal of Organic Chemistry vol.<br>
57, pages 6847-6852, 1992.<br>
The phenylpyridyl methanol represented by the<br>
formula (X), formed from the compound represented by the<br>
formula (VI) and the compound represented by the formula<br>
(VII), may be oxidized by a known means such as a metal<br>
oxidizing agent such as manganese dioxide or chromic<br>
acid, a Swern oxidation method (dimethylsulfoxide +<br>
oxalyl chloride) or a ruthenium oxidation method<br>
(tetrapropylammonium perruthenate + N-methylmorpholine-N-<br>
oxide) and converted to a compound represented by the<br>
formula (I)<br>
Now, mode of carrying out Process 3 is described<br>
below.<br>

A substituent may further be introduced into the<br>
compound represented by the formula (I) electrophilically<br>
or nucleophilically. That is, the compound represented<br>
by the formula (I) may be converted into a compound<br>
represented by the formula (I-a) or (I-b) as illustrated<br>
in the following scheme. Further, it is also possible to<br>
radically introduce a substituent into the compound<br>
represented by the formula (I). Here, in the formula (I-<br>
a), E is an electrophilic reagent, and in the formula (I-<br>
b), Nu is a nucleophilic reagent.<br>
n' and n' are as defined for the above n.<br><br>
The reaction to prepare the compound represented by<br>
the formula (I-a) varies properly depending upon the<br>
 electrophile, and the reaction may usually be carried out<br>
by a known process or a process in accordance therewith.<br>
For example, the above-described Process 1 may be<br>
employed. The nucleophilic substitution to prepare the<br>
compound represented by the formula (I-b) varies properly<br>
depending upon the nucleophile, and the reaction may<br>
usually be carried out by a known process or a process in<br>
accordance therewith. For example, in a case of an<br>
ethyloxy nucleophilic reagent, it is preferred to carry<br>
out the reaction in the presence of an inert solvent such<br>
as ethanol or dioxane, toluene or octane as the solvent,<br>
at a reaction temperature of from 0 to 120°C for a proper<br>
time. The ethyloxy nucleophilic reagent is used in from<br>
0.1 to 10 mol equivalent amount, preferably in from 0.5<br>
to 5 mol equivalent amount.<br>
Further, the compound represented by the formula (I-<br>
c) (the compound of the formula (I) wherein X is a<br>
halogen atom) may further be converted into a compound<br>
represented by the formula (I-d) by removing the halogen<br>
substituent, as shown in the following scheme. For the<br>
reaction as illustrated by the scheme, catalytic<br>
hydrogenation, hydrogen transfer reaction or metal<br>
reduction reaction may properly be employed. In the<br>
scheme, Hal is a halogen atom.<br>
The catalytic hydrogenation may be carried out in<br>
the presence of a catalyst under hydrogen gas atmosphere<br>
under normal pressure or under elevated pressure in the<br>
presence of a proper solvent. The catalyst to be used<br>
may, for example, be a catalyst system having platinum,<br>
palladium, rhodium, ruthenium, nickel or iridium. The<br>
solvent to be used may, for example, be water, an alcohol<br>
(such as methanol or ethanol), ethyl acetate, acetic<br>
acid, dioxane, ether, benzene or hexane. In such a case,<br>
the catalyst is used in a proportion of from 0.01 to 1.2<br>
mol based on the compound represented by the formula (I-<br>
c) . Further, the reaction may be carried out in the<br>
presence of a base such as triethylamine or sodium<br>
hydrogen carbonate. Further, a known reduction reaction<br>
may be employed such as hydrogen transfer reaction (e.g.<br>
palladium carbon, ammonium formate as a hydrogen source,<br>
or sodium dihydrogen phosphate) or a metal reduction<br>
reaction (e.g. samarium diiodide).<br>
