METHOD AND APPARATUS<br>
FOR POWERING ELECTRONICS ASSOCIATED<br>
WITH A TELEPHONE LINE TWISTED PAIR<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001] This invention relates to transmission of broadband DSL data and<br>
television signals over conventional analog telephone twisted pair lines.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0002] Most telephone companies today provide analog telephone and other<br>
services to customers using a legacy infrastructure comprising a single twisted<br>
pair (TP) of wires for each telephone number. Conventional analog telephone<br>
service is often referred to as a plain old telephone service (POTS), and the<br>
twisted pair is referred to as a POTS line pair, or simply as a POTS TP. In some<br>
instances, it is desirable to locate auxiliary electronic devices or equipment<br>
associated with the twisted pair at locations other than either the service<br>
provider's central office (CO) or the customer's premises (CP). This is<br>
particularly the case where the telephone company offers other types of services<br>
	 to customers, such as broadband data services, e.g., DSL services, where it<br>
may be desirable to employ signal processing electronics such as amplifiers, line<br>
equalizers, or signal boosters, for instance, at an intermediate location on the TP<br>
lines. Providing operating power to such electronics in the field, particularly at<br>
remote locations, can be difficult and challenging. If an AC power grid is<br>
accessible at the remote location, it may be tapped to provide operating power to<br>
the electronics. However, this is not always either convenient or an option. It<br>
requires technicians in the field to deal with high voltage wiring, and the power<br>
company may not permit technicians other than their own personnel to access<br>
the power grid.<br><br>
WO 2007/047006	PCT/US2006/036677<br>
-2-<br>
[0003]	Another approach for powering remote devices associated with a<br>
first twisted pair of lines is to use one or more other twisted pairs of lines from<br>
the central office that are not active, i.e., that are not used for providing voice,<br>
data or other services to customers, to carry power to the remote devices. In<br>
some cases, multiple lines from the CO may be tied together (bonded) in order<br>
to power electronics associated with one active twisted pair. This is<br>
disadvantageous since using inactive lines for providing power uses valuable<br>
resources, making them otherwise unavailable, may consume large amounts of<br>
power, and is otherwise not cost effective.<br>
[0004]	Another approach, which is also problematic and which generally<br>
has been less than successful, attempts to extract power from an active twisted<br>
pair of lines to power electronic circuits. The telephone company uses DC and<br>
AC currents for line signaling and control of POTS service. Schemes that extract<br>
power from the twisted pair can interfere with the normal signaling and control<br>
functions provided by these DC and AC currents and disrupt the POTS service<br>
or cause other problems on a line. Accordingly, such approaches have been<br>
feasible only in limited situations.<br>
[0005]	There is a need for flexible and convenient approaches for<br>
powering remote electronics associated with an active twisted pair of telephone<br>
lines that address the foregoing and other disadvantages of known approaches.<br>
In particular, it is desirable to provide systems and methods for powering remote<br>
electronics from an active twisted pair of telephone lines which is being used by<br>
a service provider for providing services to customers without disrupting or<br>
interfering with these services, and it is to these ends that the present invention<br>
is directed.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0006]	The invention enables operating power for auxiliary electrical<br>
devices, such as signal processing and other types of electronics devices, used<br>
with an active twisted pair of telephones lines over which a service provider<br>
provides a service to be derived from the active pair of lines without disrupting or<br>
interfering with the normal service operation of the lines. More particularly, the<br><br>
WO 2007/047006	PCT/US2006/036677<br>
-3-<br>
invention affords apparatus and methods that extract power from one or more<br>
signals carried on the active telephone lines, and convert this power to a suitable<br>
operating power for auxiliary devices that process signals on the same twisted<br>
pair of lines.<br>
[0007]	In one aspect, the invention provides a power supply adapted to be<br>
connected to a twisted pair at a location between a central office and a'<br>
customer's premises. The power supply receives a voltage and current from one<br>
of the lines, and provides a preselected output voltage to an auxiliary electrical<br>
device and a return current to the second line. A current regulator adapted to be<br>
disposed in the second line, receives this return current, and regulates and limits<br>
the current flowing in the second line from the customer premises such that the<br>
total current flowing to the central office is less than a predetermined value.<br>
[0008]	In another aspect, the invention provides an apparatus for<br>
powering auxiliary electrical devices from a plurality of twisted pairs in a shared<br>
power arrangement. Each of the twisted pairs includes a power supply that<br>
receives a voltage and current from one of the lines, provides a preselected<br>
output voltage to an associated auxiliary electrical device, and provides a return<br>
current to the second line. A first current regulator adapted to be disposed in the<br>
second line, receives this return current, and regulates and limits the current<br>
flowing in the second line from the customer premises such that the total current<br>
flowing to the central office is less than a first predetermined value. A second<br>
current regulator in a return line to the power supply from the auxiliary device<br>
limits the return current to the power supply to a second predetermined value.<br>
The plurality of power supplies of the plurality of twisted pairs have their output<br>
terminals connected in parallel to share power to one or more auxiliary electrical<br>
devices so that no twisted pair of the plurality has a total return current in excess<br>
of a third predetermined value.<br>

BEST MODES FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
[0016]	The invention provides apparatus and methods that are particularly<br>
well adapted for extracting power from conventional POTS twisted pair<br>
telephone lines to provide operating power to signal processing electronics that<br>
increases the bandwidth of the lines and/or the distance over which high speed<br>
data can be provided, and will be described in that context. It will be<br>
appreciated, however, that this is illustrative of only one utility of the invention,<br>
and that the invention may be used for deriving power for other types of<br>
electronic circuits and devices and in other contexts.<br>
[0017]	Figure 1 illustrates schematically a generalized equivalent circuit<br>
for a POTS twisted pair telephone line system, and shows in block diagram form<br>
power extraction apparatus 20 in accordance with the invention that derives<br>
power from the POTS twisted pair for powering auxiliary signal processing<br>
electronics 22. As shown in Figure 1, the twisted pair comprises a 'Tip" line 24<br>
and a "Ring" line 26 which extend from a telephone central office (CO) and a<br><br>
WO 2007/047006	PCT/US2006/036677<br>
-5-<br>
service provider switch 28 to service customer premises equipment (CPE), such<br>
as a telephone 34 located at the customer's premises (CP). The CO switch 28<br>
may multiplex multiple services for the customer onto the two POTS TP lines 24,<br>
26. Examples of services may include voice, data, dial-up, video, audio, etc.<br>
The distance between the CO and the CP over which the twisted pair of POTS<br>
lines 24, 26 extends may be several tens of thousands of feet. The twisted pair<br>
may comprise a number of different lengths or sections of unshielded twisted<br>
pairs of electrical conductors, such as copper wire, of various gauges, connected<br>
to intervening circuits and/or switches to form a contiguous twisted pair line path<br>
between the CO and the CP. The twisted pair carries DC and AC currents<br>
between the CO and the CP. The DC and low frequency AC currents are used<br>
for control and signaling purposes by the telephone company, and higher<br>
frequency AC currents from the audio frequency range up to about 1 - 2 MHz, for<br>
instance, are used for normal telephone, data and other types of services<br>
including, for example, DSL (Digital Subscriber Lines) services. The power<br>
extraction apparatus 20 and the signal processing electronics 22 may comprise<br>
either one assembly 29 or separate units disposed at an intermediate location on<br>
the TP between the CO and the CP. At the CP, a hybrid or other such device 30<br>
may demultiplex telephone audio and other services from the TP.<br>
[0018]	As shown in Figure 1, the Tip line 24 is normally grounded at the<br>
CO and maintained at 0 volts. A 48 volt battery 32 at the CO applies -48 volts<br>
DC to the Ring line 26. When a telephone 34 at the CP is "on hook" (not in use)<br>
a hook switch 36 of the telephone is open and substantially no DC current flows<br>
through the circuit from the CO to the CP over the twisted pair. When the phone<br>
is "off hook", i.e., in use or busy as when a user picks up the handset or presses<br>
a speaker- phone button to use the phone, the hook switch is closed and a DC<br>
current does flow through the circuit. A principal function of this DC current is to<br>
enable the CO to determine when the phone is off hook. AC currents are used<br>
for ringing the phone, for dialing, and for voice or other services. To ring the<br>
telephone, the CO applies a low frequency AC ring voltage of approximately 90<br>
volts RMS to the Ring line 26 from a ring signal generator 38. The AC ring<br>
current flows over the twisted pair to a ringer 37 in the telephone coupled to the<br><br>
WO 2007/047006	PCTYUS2006/036677<br>
-6-<br>
TP by a capacitor 39 for signaling an incoming call. The dial signaling, voice and<br>
data AC voltages are typically of the order of a few volts or less. The "off hook"<br>
condition of the phone is the state that allows dialing and voice transmission.<br>
- [0019]	When the phone 34 is off hook, it presents a resistance Rp of the<br>
order of 300 ohms across the Tip and Ring TP lines, and has a voltage of the<br>
order of 6 volts DC across it. This results in a DC current flow of the order of 20<br>
mA through the telephone circuit. The Tip and Ring TP lines have a substantial<br>
distributed resistance. In Figure 1, this resistance is represented by the resistors<br>
R-n and RT2 in the Tip line, and the resistors RR1 and RR2 in the Ring line. The<br>
values of these resistors depend upon, among other things, the distances<br>
between the CO and the CP, the intermediate location of the power extraction<br>
apparatus, and the types and gauges of wire that constitute the twisted pair path.<br>
For example, the resistance of 26-Gauge AWG copper twisted pair is of the<br>
order of approximately 286 ohms per kilometer. When the telephone goes off<br>
hook, the distributed resistance of the TP causes a substantial voltage drop from<br>
the 48 volts at the CO due to the DC current flow through the lines. When the<br>
DC current flowing through the telephone circuit exceeds a pre-selected value,<br>
e.g., typically 20 - 24 mA, an off hook current sensor or detector (not shown) in<br>
the CO indicates to the CO that the phone is off hook.<br>
[0020]	In accordance with the invention, power extraction apparatus 20 is<br>
inserted across the Tip and Ring lines 24, 26 at an intermediate location<br>
between the CO and the CP. The power extraction apparatus extracts DC<br>
power from the lines to provide operating power to signal processing electronics<br>
22 or other auxiliary electronics devices which may process one or more of the<br>
service signals on the twisted pair. The signal processing electronics may<br>
include, for example, signal gain or line equalization circuits to compensate for<br>
losses on the twisted pair to increase the distance over which high speed data<br>
can be provided or to increase the bandwidth of the line for higher speed data<br>
transmission s.uch as DSL. As will be described in more detail shortly, power<br>
extraction apparatus 20 extracts DC power from the twisted pair 24, 26 in a<br>
manner that does not adversely affect the performance or operation of the<br>
normal POTS telephone circuit, and provides a stable, constant source of<br><br>
WO 2007/047006	PCT/US2006/036677<br>
-7-<br>
operating power to the signal processing electronics or other devices. The<br>
power extraction apparatus 20 and signal processing electronics 22 may<br>
comprise a single assembly 29, as mentioned, or may Comprise separate units<br>
inserted into the twisted pair lines at substantially the same location or separated<br>
from one another.<br>
[0021]	Figure 2 is a block diagram of a first embodiment of power<br>
extraction apparatus 20 in accordance with the invention. As shown, and as will<br>
be described in more detail, the power extraction apparatus may include a power<br>
supply 48 comprising a power supply pre-regulator and protector 50, a DC-to-DC<br>
converter 52, and a current regulator 54. The power supply pre-regulator and<br>
protector 50 may connect directly to the Tip line, and connect to the Ring line<br>
through the current regulator 54, as indicated in Figure 2. As will be described,<br>
the power supply pre-regulator and protector protects the DC-to-DC converter<br>
and insures that the converter receives a relatively constant input voltage, even<br>
when the voltages on the Tip and Ring lines experience changes due to ring or<br>
other signals, due to voltage spikes produced by transient events such as<br>
lightening, or due to environmental conditions. The power supply pre-regulator<br>
and protector may also insure that unwanted electrical noise, if any, from the<br>
signal processing electronics 22 is not introduced into the service path through<br>
the power supply 48. The current regulator 54, as will be described, serves to<br>
regulate and limit the DC current flow through the twisted pair to insure that the<br>
power supply and the signal processing electronics receive sufficient current to<br>
meet their operational needs, while limiting the amount of phone current from the<br>
CP to insure that the normal control signals on the Tip and Ring lines are not<br>
adversely affected and that normal POTS service is not disrupted.<br>
[0022]	As will also be described in more detail below, the DC-to-DC<br>
converter 52 preferably converts a higher voltage, lower current power received<br>
from the power supply pre-regulator and protector 50 into a stable lower voltage,<br>
higher current power for the signal processing electronics 22. For example, as<br>
will be described, the DC-to-DC converter may receive an input voltage in the<br>
range of 12 to 95 volts DC and produce an output voltage in the range of 2.5 to<br>
10 volts DC.<br><br>
WO 2007/047006	PCT/US2006/036677<br>
-8-<br>
[0023]	Figure 3 illustrates a preferred embodiment of a pre-regulator and<br>
protector 50 of power supply 48 in accordance with the invention. As shown, the<br>
power supply pre-regulator and protector may include a high voltage protection<br>
device 60, a filter transformer 62, such as a toroid transformer, a rectifier bridge<br>
64, and a voltage regulator 66. The high voltage protection device 60 may have<br>
input and return lines 68 and 70 connected, respectively, to the Tip line 24 of the<br>
TP and to a balance (BAL) line of the current regulator 54. These lines may be<br>
unprotected from the physical environment. Accordingly, the high voltage<br>
protective device 60, which may comprise, for example, a standard MOV (metal<br>
oxide varistor) surge protector limits power surges into the power supply pre-<br>
regulator and protector caused by random transient high voltages due, for<br>
example, to lightening. The high voltage protection device may be selected to<br>
limit the output voltage to a desired maximum voltage, such as 300 volts. This<br>
voltage is high enough to avoid interfering with the ring signal from the CO,<br>
which has a peak-to-peak value in the order of 250 volts, while providing<br>
reasonable protection from excessively high voltage spikes. The outputs 72, 73<br>
from the high voltage protection device may be connected to the filter<br>
transformer 62, comprising magnetically coupled coils in anti-phase as, for<br>
example, a wound toroid transformer. The filter transformer prevents noise,<br>
which may affect service quality such as voice quality, from feeding back through<br>
the high voltage protection device 60 and on to the twisted pair.<br>
[0024]	The outputs 74, 75 from the filter transformer 62 may be connected<br>
to the rectifier bridge 64, such as a full-wave rectifier bridge. The rectifier bridge<br>
converts the DC and AC voltages on its input lines 74, 75 to a positive supply<br>
voltage on an output line 76 relative to a reference voltage, such as ground, on a<br>
return line 78. The rectifier bridge output voltage on line 76 can be greater than<br>
90-100 volts during certain operating conditions, e.g., during ringing or lightening<br>
activity. Therefore, the voltage regulator 66 converts the voltage on line 76 from<br>
the rectifier bridge to a substantially constant and stable DC voltage on an output<br>
line 80 having a value that is selected to prevent damage to the DC-to-DC<br>
converter and enable the converter to supply operating power to the signal<br>
processing electronics.<br><br>
WO 2007/047006	PCT/US2006/036677<br>
-9-<br>
[0025]	As shown in Figure 3, the voltage regulator 66 may comprise an<br>
NPN transistor 84 having its collector connected to output 76 of the bridge<br>
rectifier through a resistor 86, its base connected to a voltage reference device,<br>
such as a Zener diode 88, and its emitter connected to output line 80. Resistor<br>
86 limits the current flowing into the transistor from the rectifier bndge. A<br>
second resistor 87 connected between the collector and the base of the<br>
transistor provides a current flow through the Zener diode 88 and biases the<br>
base of the transistor at the Zener breakdown voltage. The output voltage on<br>
the emitter of the transistor at 80 is equal to the Zener breakdown voltage minus<br>
the base-to-emitter p-n junction voltage of the transistor, which is typically<br>
approximately 0.7 volts. Accordingly, by selecting a Zener diode 88 that has a<br>
breakdown voltage of 51 volts, the output voltage of the regulator at 80 will be<br>
held to approximately +50 volts DC. A filter capacitor 90 may be connected<br>
across the output lines 78, 80 of the voltage regulator, as shown. To<br>
accommodate the ring voltage, transistor 84 preferably has a breakdown voltage<br>
of the order of 400 volts.<br>
[0026]	The DC to-DC converter 52 converts the DC voltage at the output<br>
80 of the voltage regulator 66 to an appropriate substantially constant and stable<br>
operating voltage for the signal processing electronics. The DC-to-DC converter<br>
may be a standard commercially available DC-to-DC integrated circuit step-down<br>
switching regulator, such as a type LM5008 integrated circuit available from<br>
National Semiconductor, Inc. This integrated circuit can accept input voltages in<br>
the range of 12 to 95 volts DC and produce a selected output voltage in the<br>
iange of 2.5 to 10 volts DC. The product application brochure for theLM5008<br>
illustrates circuit configurations and representative values of circuit elements for<br>
different desired output voltages. Preferably, the DC-to-DC converter is<br>
configured for an input of the order of 48 volts DC at a current of 10 mA, and an<br>
output of the order of 4 volts DC at 50 mA. This output serves as a stable DC<br>
power supply for the signal processing electronics 22.<br>
[0027] When the phone is on hook, there is no DC current flow through the<br>
phone over the TP lines, and the voltage at the intermediate location of the<br>
power extraction apparatus 20 will be the difference between the 48 volts<br><br>
WO 2007/047006	PCT/US2006/036677<br>
-10-<br>
supplied to the Tip and Ring lines by the CO and the voltage drop due the<br>
current flowing through the distributed line resistance from the CO to the power<br>
extraction apparatus. This current is preferably selected to be of the order of 10<br>
to 14 mA. When the phone is off hook, it acts as a 300 ohm resistor between the<br>
tip and the Ring TP lines and has about 6 volts across it, resulting in an off hook<br>
current flow of the order of 20 mA, as previously described. The combined off<br>
hook current and the current to the power extraction apparatus flowing through<br>
the TP lines will result in a substantial voltage drop at the location of the power<br>
extraction apparatus 20, which may be reflected as a lower than expected input<br>
voltage to the DC-to-DC converter from output 80 of the voltage regulator 66.<br>
Under these conditions, the DC-to-DC converter will consume a greater amount<br>
of current than normal as it attempts to maintain the preset output voltage,<br>
producing, in turn, a greater voltage drop. If the voltage drops too low, the DC-<br>
to-DC converter may not operate properly. Moreover, the voltage drop may<br>
cause the DC-to-DC converter to continue drawing more current than the preset<br>
value of the off hook current detector at the CO when the phone goes back on<br>
hook, causing the CO to fail to recognize that the phone is back on hook and<br>
effectively latching the phone line in a "busy" condition.<br>
[0028] To avoid these problems, the invention employs the current regulator<br>
54 in the Ring line to regulate the current flowing through the phone when it is off<br>
hook and to limit the phone current to a pre-selected value, e.g., 10 mA. This<br>
limits the total current that would otherwise flow through the TP circuit during off<br>
hook conditions, and, accordingly, reduces the voltage drop that the power<br>
supply would experience. By limiting the off hook phone current to 10/mA, for<br>
example, the desired amount of current, e.g., 10 to 14 mA, will be available from<br>
the power supply for the signal processing electronics 22 even when the phone<br>
is off hook. Thus, when the phone goes back on hook, the line current will drop<br>
below the pre-set level of the off hook current detector at the CO so that the<br>
telephone service operates normally.<br>
[0029] Figure 4 illustrates a preferred embodiment of a current regulator 54<br>
in accordance with the invention for automatically regulating and limiting the<br>
phone current flowing through the Tip and Ring TP lines. As indicated in Figures<br><br>
WO 2007/047006	PCT/US2006/036677<br>
-11-<br>
2 and 4, the current regulator is preferably inserted into the Ring line 26. As<br>
shown in Figure 4, the current regulator may comprise a pair of semiconductor<br>
devices 100,102, such as NPN transistors, connected back-to-back in such a<br>
way as to monitor the total current flow to the CO in the Ring line and limit the<br>
current flow from the CP when the total current reaches a predetermined value.<br>
[0030] Referring to Figure 4, transistors 100,102 and an associated pair of<br>
resistors 104,106 may be connected together such that the base of transistor<br>
100 is connected to resistor 104 and to the collector of transistor 102, and the<br>
emitter of transistor 100 is connected to the base of transistor 102 and to one<br>
side, of resistor 106 at a node 108. The collector of transistor 100 and the other<br>
side of resistor 104 may be connected to the Ring line 26 coming from the TP at<br>
a node 110; and the emitter of transistor 102 and resistor 106 may be connected<br>
to the Ring line going to the CO at another node 112. In an off hook condition, a<br>
portion of the current flowing into node 110 from the phone flows through resistor<br>
104 and into the base of transistor 100, turning the transistor on. This enables<br>
the phone current to flow from the emitter of transistor 100 through resistor 106<br>
- and the Ring line 26 to the CO. Current from the balance (BAL) terminal 70 of<br>
the high voltage protection device 60 of the power supply pre-regulator and<br>
protector 50 (see Figure 3) enters the current regulator at node 108, and flows<br>
through resistor 106 to node 112 and to the CO. Thus, the total current flowing<br>
through resistor 106 is the sum of the phone current entering node 110 and<br>
flowing from the emitter of transistor 100 and the current from the BAL terminal<br>
70 of the high voltage protection device entering the current regulator at node<br>
108. As long as the voltage drop across resistor 106 duelo the "combined "'<br>
current is less than the voltage necessary to forward bias the base-to-emitter p-n<br>
junction of transistor 102 (approximately 0.7 volts), the transistor remains turned<br>
off and the current entering node 110 is not limited. However, as the current<br>
through resistor 106 increases, the voltage drop increases and starts to forward<br>
bias the base-to-emitter junction of transistor 102, which starts to turn the<br>
transistor on. As transistor 102 turns on, it reduces the base-to-emitter voltage<br>
of transistor 100, which starts to turn transistor 100 off. This, in turn, reduces the<br>
current flowing through the phone at the CP and into node 110. Accordingly, by<br><br>
WO 2007/047006	PCT/US2006/036677<br>
-12-<br>
appropriately selecting the value of resistor 106, the current regulator 54 can<br>
automatically regulate and limit the off hook DC phone current flowing through<br>
the twisted pair to a desired value.<br>
[0031] Assuming a current flow of the order of 10 to 14 mA is desired for the<br>
power supply, and that this current flows into node 108 at the current regulator, if<br>
the value of resistor 106 is selected to be 33 ohms, the current regulator will limit<br>
the phone current during an off hook condition to a value of the order of 10 mA.<br>
Thus, the current regulator insures that sufficient current is available for the<br>
power supply so the DC-to-DC converter provides the desired constant and<br>
stable DC voltage for the signal processing electronics during an off hook<br>
condition, while limiting the total current so that when the phone goes back on<br>
hook the power supply current is less than the pre-set value of the off hook<br>
current detector at the CO. This allows normal operation of the telephone circuit<br>
when the phone goes back on hook. A capacitor 116 connected across the<br>
current regulator between nodes 110 and 112 provides an AC bypass for voice,<br>
ring and other AC signals so that the current regulator regulates only DC phone<br>
current flowing through the Ring line back to the CO.<br>
[0032]	The current regulator 54 of Figure 4 works well to regulate and limit<br>
the current flowing through the phone during off hook conditions and when the<br>
power extraction apparatus is providing current in a desired range to the signal<br>
processing electronics. The current regulator 54 does not limit the current<br>
flowing into node 108 from the BAL terminal 70 of the high voltage protection<br>
device 60 and back to the CO. As indicated above, under certain operating<br>
conditions such as, for example, a significant voltage drop at the location of the<br>
power supply or a high voltage spike caused, for instance, by a transient<br>
condition on the TP, the current consumption of the DC-to-DC converter will<br>
increase as it tries to maintain the pre-set output voltage. If the current<br>
increases to a level that is greater than a pre-set value of the off hook current<br>
detector at the CO, the telephone line may "latch up" due to the excessive<br>
current flow, even though the phone is on hook. To prevent this situation, the<br>
invention also preferably regulates the current flowing into the DC-to-DC<br>
converter, and limits the current to a pre-selected value that is less than the pre-<br><br>
WO 2007/047006	PCT/US2006/036677<br>
-13-<br>
set value of the off hook current detector at the CO, e.g., less than about 20 mA.<br>
Preferably, the current to the DC-to-DC converter is limited to a value of the<br>
order of 14 mA, as will now be described.<br>
[0033]	Figure 5 illustrates an alternative embodiment of the invention that<br>
includes a power supply current regulator 120 disposed within the output line 80<br>
of the voltage regulator 66 that powers the DC-to-DC converter. As shown in<br>
Figure 5, the power supply current regulator may comprise an NPN transistor<br>
122 and a resistor 124 connected to the power supply voltage regulator 66 such<br>
that the base of transistor 122 and one side of resistor 124 are connected to the<br>
emitter of the voltage regulator transistor 84; the collector of transistor 122 is<br>
connected to the base of transistor 84, and the emitter of transistor 122 and the<br>
other side of resistor 124 are connected to output line 80 to the DC-to-DC<br>
converter.<br>
[0034] Under normal operating conditions, transistor 84 of the voltage<br>
regulator supplies the desired amount of current, e.g., 10 to 14 mA, to the DC-to-<br>
DC converter through resistor 124 of the power supply current regulator 120.<br>
The value of resistor 124 may be selected such that the voltage drop across the<br>
resistor produced by the normal current flow is less than the voltage required to<br>
forward bias the base-to-emitter p-n junction of transistor 122. Thus, transistor<br>
122 remains turned off. However, should the current flow to the DC-to-DC<br>
converter increase, the voltage drop across resistor 124 will increase. When the<br>
current flow reaches a value such that the voltage drop across resistor 124<br>
begins to forward bias the base-to-emitter junction of transistor 122, the<br>
transistor begins to turn on. As transistor 122 turns on, it reduces the base-to-<br>
emitter p-n junction voltage of transistor 84, which starts to turn off transistor 84.<br>
As transistor 84 turns off, the current flowing through resistor 124 to the DC-to-<br>
DC converter is reduced accordingly.<br>
[0035] Thus, the current regulator 120 regulates and limits the current to the<br>
DC-to-DC converter to a desired maximum vaiue. By appropriately selecting the<br>
value of resistor 124, the maximum value of the current drawn by the DC-to-DC<br>
converter can be set to insure that the total current flowing through the power<br><br>
WO 2007/047006	PCT/US2006/036677<br>
-14-<br>
supply 48 to the Ring line 26 and back to the CO is less than the pre-set current<br>
value of the off hook detector at the CO. Preferably, the value of resistor 124 is<br>
selected such that the maximum current to the DC-to-DC converter is set to a<br>
value, e.g., 14 mA, that is within the normal input current operating range of the<br>
DC-to-DC converter. Thus, should a transient or other abnormal condition which<br>
would produce excessive current flow occur during an off hook condition, the<br>
power supply current regulator 120 regulates the current flowing in the TP circuit<br>
so that when the phone goes back on hook, the current flow drops to a level<br>
below the off hook detector at the CO. This insures that line latch-up does not<br>
occur and the operation of the telephone circuit is not disrupted.<br>
[0036]	Figure 6 is a block diagram of another embodiment of power<br>
extraction apparatus in accordance with the invention that operates in a pooled<br>
or shared TP line arrangement. The telephone company typically provides a<br>
plurality of TP lines bundled together, such as in a 25-line group, from the CO to<br>
a location where the bundle of lines is terminated and individual TP lines are split<br>
off to separate customers. The lines are typically terminated at a binder within a<br>
canister, and it is convenient to derive power in a shared power arrangement<br>
from the bundled lines for powering the signal processing electronics or other<br>
devices for individual TP circuits. This pooled arrangement is illustrated in block<br>
diagram form in Figure 6.<br>
[0037]	As shown, each of a plurality of TP line pairs TP-1, TP-2, ...TP-N,<br>
may have an associated power extraction apparatus 20-1; 20-2,...20-N that may<br>
be substantially the same as described above, each respectively comprising a<br>
power supply pre-regulator and protector 50-1, 50-2, ...50-N, a phone current<br>
regulator 54-1, 54-2, ...54-N and a power supply current regulator 120-1, 120-2,<br>
... 120-N for limiting the current to associated DC-to-DC converters. In addition,<br>
each power extraction apparatus may also have another current regulator 130-1,<br>
130-2, ...130-N, connected in the negative return lines 78-1, 78-2, ...78-N from<br>
the DC-to-DC converters to the voltage regulators 66 of the power supply pre-<br>
regulator and protectors 50-1, 50-2, ...50-N, as shown in Figure 6 and as is<br>
illustrated in more detail in Figure 7. The power supply current regulators 120-1,<br>
120-2, ... 120-N limit the current flowing to the DC-to-DC converters as<br><br>
WO 2007/047006	PCT/US2006/036677<br>
-15-<br>
previously described. The current regulators 130-1,130-2, ...130-N further limit<br>
the current consumption of associated DC-to-DC converters in the case of<br>
transient or other abnormal conditions, such as voltage spikes, for instance^<br>
which result in excessive current flow. Under such abnormal conditions, this<br>
excessive current flow may cause line latching, as previously described, as the<br>
DC-to-DC converter attempts to maintain the preset output voltage to the signal<br>
processing electronics. The pooled embodiment of Figure 6 avoids this by<br>
allowing current sharing from the pooled TP lines. Lines that do not experience<br>
high current conditions may be used to provide a portion of the required current<br>
flow (which may be greater than the off hook detection value at the CO) for a line<br>
that requires such a flow to insure that the DC-to-DC converter of that line can<br>
maintain a stable output voltage and current to its associated signal processing<br>
electronics without causing line latching. The current regulator 130-1,130-2,<br>
... 130-N in the return line from a DC-to-DC converter insures that the current<br>
flowing through the power supply pre-regulator and protector and to the balance<br>
terminal of the current regulator 54 remains less than the pre-set current value of<br>
the off hook detector at the CO. The shared power arrangement of Figure 6<br>
affords greater safety in the events that multiple lines experience high current<br>
conditions at the same time since it allows the excess current requirements to be<br>
distributed among all lines of the group.<br>
[0038]	Figure 7 illustrates a preferred embodiment of a DC-to-DC<br>
converter current regulator 130 which may be used in the power extraction<br>
apparatus. As shown, the DC-to-DC converter current regulator 130 may be<br>
inserted into a return line 78 from the DC-to-DC converter to the voltage<br>
regulator 66 and the rectifier bridge 64. The current regulator 130 may comprise<br>
a pair of NPN transistors 140,142 and a pair of resistors 144, 146 connected<br>
together in an arrangement similar to the current regulator 54 of Figure 4. As<br>
shown, transistors 140 and 142 may be connected back-to-back with the emitter<br>
of transistor 140 connected to the base of transistor 142 and to one side of<br>
resistor 146, and the collector of transistor 142 connected to the base of<br>
transistor 140 and one side of resistor 144. The other side of resistor 144 may<br>
be connected to a node 148 in the return line 78 from the DC-to-DC converter,<br><br>
WO 2007/047006	PCT/US2006/036677<br>
-16-<br>
and the emitter of transistor 142 and the other side of resistor 146 may be<br>
connected to a node 150 in the return line 78 to the rectifier bridge. In addition,<br>
the anode of Zener diode 88 of the voltage regulator circuit 66 also may be<br>
connected to node 150, as shown.<br>
[0039]	The voltage regulator 66 and the current regulator 120 of the<br>
embodiment of Figure 7 may function in substantially the same way as<br>
previously described in connection with the second embodiment illustrated in<br>
Figure 5. The voltage regulator provides a substantially constant output voltage<br>
to the current regulator 120 under normal operating conditions, and the current<br>
regulator 120 limits the current flow to the DC-to-DC converter under abnormal<br>
operating conditions at which the converter would otherwise consume excessive<br>
current. Current regulator 130 further operates to regulate and limit the return<br>
current from the DC-to-DC converter under abnormal conditions to a desired pre-<br>
set level.<br>
[0040] Referring to Figure 7, under normal conditions current flowing from<br>
node 148 in the return line 78 through resistor 144 forward biases the base-to-<br>
emitter p-n junction of transistor 140, turning on the transistor. As long as the<br>
current flowing from the emitter of transistor 140 through resistor 146 to node<br>
150 in the return line 78 to the rectifier bridge produces a voltage drop that is<br>
less than the base-to-emitter p-n junction voltage necessary to forward bias<br>
transistor 142 (approximately 0.7 volts), transistor 142 is turned off. However, if<br>
the current through resistor 146 increases due to the occurrence of an abnormal<br>
condition, such as a voltage spike, for example, the voltage drop begins to<br>
forward bias the base-to-emitter p-n junction of transistor 142, turning the<br>
transistor on. As transistor 142 turns on, it reduces the base-to-emitter voltage<br>
of transistor 140, which starts to turn transistor 140 off. Thus, by appropriately<br>
selecting the value of resistor 146 (for instance, to be the same as resistor 124 of<br>
current regulator 120) the current regulator 130 limits the current flowing in return<br>
line 78 to a desired value, e.g., 14 mA. This, in turn, limits the current flowing<br>
from the BAL line 70 of the high voltage protection device into node 108 of the<br>
current regulator 54, and through Ring line 26 back to the CO.<br><br>
WO 2007/047006	PCT7US2006/036677<br>
-17-<br>
[0041] As shown in Figure 6, by tying together all of the positive power supply lines 80-1; 80-2,.. .80-N and all of the return lines 78-1, 78-2,. . .78-N of<br>
the DC-to-DC converters in the pooled arrangement, a combined current may be<br>
shared from among the various power supplies. Accordingly, all of the DC-to-DC<br>
converters in the pooled arrangement are enabled to maintain a substantially<br>
stable output voltage and current to their associate signal processing circuits<br>
during abnormal conditions without drawing through any one TP line more than<br>
the pre-set off hook detector current. This avoids line latching or otherwise<br>
disrupting the normal operation of the telephone circuits of any of the twisted<br>
pairs of lines.<br>
