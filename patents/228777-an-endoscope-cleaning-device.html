				<td>TECHNICAL HELD<br>
This invention relates to cleaning devices; and methods, and more particularly to a<br>
method and apparatus for cleaning the exterior of contaminated surgical instruments.<br>
The device has been developed for use in cleaning the exterior of rigid or flexible<br>
endoscopes and will be described primarily with reference to that use.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
An endoscope is an elongate tubular installment that may be rigid or flexible and which<br>
incorporates an optical or video system and light source. Typically, the endoscope is<br>
configured so that one end can be inserted to some depth into a surgical incision or body<br>
cavity via an incision or orifice whereby surfaces on or near the internally inserted end of<br>
the endoscope may be viewed by an external observer. A commonly used endoscope is a<br>
flexible endoscope called a colonoscope and is used for diagnostic procedures of the<br>
human colon. The colon insertion portion of the instrument is approximately two meters<br>
long and has one or more hollow channels, or lumens.<br>
Because of the high cost of endoscopes and the need to avoid cross infection from one<br>
patient to the next, each endoscope must be thoroughly cleaned and disinfected or<br>
sterilised after each use. This procedure is time consuming and presents major<br>
difficulties because the endoscope becomes significantly contaminated with biological<br>
material from the patient for example mucus, faeces, blood, pieces of tissue and the like.<br><br>
A typical cleaning procedure involves raising and scrubbing the endoscope exterior<br>
under running water for some time to remove gross contaminants, subsequently soaking<br>
the endoscope in a suitable cleaning bath for 2 to 10 minutes, rinsing the instrument,<br>
drying the instrument and then disinfecting it. On some occasions the gross<br>
contaminants on the outside of the instrument are inadequately removed by rinsing and<br>
the subsequent cleaning bath prior to disinfection. This inadequate external cleaning<br>
then compromises the disinfection or sterilisation step since it is impossible to<br>
reproducibly disinfect or clean a dirty instrument.<br>
Because the time required for cleaning and disinfection or sterilisation is often longer<br>
than the duration of the procedure in which the endoscope is used, capital must be<br>
expended on a plurality of instruments or else cleaning becomes the determining factor<br>
as to the rate at which procedures can be performed. Moreover a considerable amount of<br>
time and materials are consumed in cleaning the brushes and other apparatus used to<br>
clean the endoscope including the lumens;. Recently attention has been paid to improved<br>
methods of cleaning the interior of the lumen (see eg our co-pending application<br>
PCT/AU99/00669), however that method is not applicable to the exterior surface.<br>
Cleaning the exterior remains a critical, difficult and labour intensive task. Various<br>
sophisticated chemical and biochemical products, for example enzyme/detergent<br>
compositions, have been developed for use as pre-soaks to loosen contaminants from the<br>
exterior surface and to facilitate their subsequent removal by scrubbing. The ultimate<br>
efficacy of such treatments is heavily dependant on (a) how diligently rinsing and<br>
scrubbing is performed; (b) how much debris is on the surface after the examination and<br>
the nature of such debris; and (c) whether the soiled, instrument has been allowed to dry <br><br>
prior to cleaning and, if so, the temperature at which this drying took place. Moreover,<br>
the present Applicant has found that rinsing and scrubbing with brushes often serves<br>
merely to rearrange deposits on the surface of the instrument rather than to remove them.<br>
Furthermore, the use of brushes may create a contaminated aerosol which can endanger<br>
health-care workers in the vicinity.<br>
Any discussion of the prior art throughout the specification should in no way be<br>
considered as an admission that such prior art is widely known or forms part of common<br>
general knowledge in the field.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to overcome or ameliorate at least one of the<br>
deficiencies of the prior art, or to provide a useful or more convenient alternative.<br>
It is an object of certain preferred embodiments of the invention to provide a device and<br>
methods to improve the speed and/or efficiency of cleaning endoscopes and the like. It<br>
is an object of certain highly preferred embodiments of the invention to provide an<br>
inexpensive effective device which can be manufactured inexpensively and which can be<br>
disposable after a single use.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
According to a first aspect the invention provides a cleaning device for surgical<br>
instruments including a fabric, wipe, or sponge impregnated with a composition<br>
comprising an enzyme, a surfactant, and a humectant As herein used the term "sponge"<br>
includes polymeric open and closed cell foam materials as well as natural sponge.<br><br>
Preferred embodiments of the invention are adapted for use in cleaning the exterior<br>
tubular surface of an endoscope or external surface of another surgical instrument.<br>
Preferably the device is impregnated with a composition comprising a combination of<br>
enzymes selected from proteases, alcalastes, cellulases lipolases and mixtures thereof.<br>
The enzymes used in examples and formulations hereafter are commercially available<br>
aqueous enzyme solutions or suspensions and not pure enzymatic protein.<br>
Preferably, the total quantity of enzyme solution or suspension is present in an amount<br>
of 5 to 25 %w/w of the composition, and. more preferably in an amount of 10 to 20<br>
%w/w of the composition.<br>
Preferably, the humectant is present in the composition in an amount of 1 to 10 %w/w of<br>
the composition and more preferably in an amount of 4 to 7 %w/w of the composition.<br>
Desirably the surfactant includes at least one non-ionic surfactant.<br>
Preferably, the non-ionic surfactant is present in tne composition in an amount of 5 to 45<br>
%w/w. It is also preferred that if an anionic surfactant is present in the composition it<br>
will be in an amount of 5 to 15 %w/w. Preferably, the total surfactant in the composition<br>
is in an amount of 15 to 45% w/w.<br><br>
Desirably, the device is adapted to contact a substantial arc of the circumference of a<br>
tubular portion of the instrument, and is a dapted to slide axially along the length of the<br>
tubular portion so as to wipe the surface. Preferably the device engages an arc of up to<br>
360 degrees of the external circumference of a tubular portion of the instrument and is<br>
resiliently deformable in the radial direction. More preferably, the device is fabricated<br>
from hydrophilic fibres.<br>
Preferred embodiments of devices according to the invention remove most of the<br>
externally adherent soiling by a mechanical wiping action, but more importantly the<br>
device serves to redistribute any remaining external soiling so that the contamination<br>
which is not removed is distributed as film of thin and uniform thickness. That film is<br>
thereby adapted to achieve more efficient and speedy soil removal by enzyme digestion.<br>
According to a second aspect the invention provides a device for use in cleaning the<br>
exterior surface of a tubular endoscope requiring cleaning, said device including a pad of<br>
hydrophilic fibres having a groove extending from one end of the pad to an opposite end<br>
and adapted lesiliently to engage a portion of the endoscope exterior surface, the pad<br>
being adapted alone or with a complementary pad to substantially encircle said portion<br>
and being resiliently deformable so as to engage the surface of the encircled portion,<br>
whereby to uniformly wipe said exterior surface as the device is slid longitudinally along<br>
the endoscope tube.<br>
Preferably the pad is formed of a needle felt and has two spaced apart parallel grooves<br>
each of arcuate cross-section which may be folded into alignment on opposite sides of a<br><br>
tubular axis to form a tubular tunnel resiliently engaging the endoscope exterior about its<br>
circumference.<br>
In preferred embodiments a cleaning device according to the second aspect is febricated<br>
from a non woven fabric and is impregnated with a plurality of enzymes, a plurality of<br>
surfactants and at least one humectant. In a highly preferred form of this embodiment<br>
the non woven fabric is packed as a roll, or perforated roll, of "wipes" in a dispensing<br>
canister permitting one or more wipes to be drawn from the dispenser and torn off for<br>
use and then disposal.<br>
According to a third aspect the invention provides a package containing a cleaning<br>
device for surgical instruments, said cleaning device including a single use fabric or<br>
sponge impregnated with an enzyme, a surfactant, and a humectant.<br>
In preferred embodiments according to the third aspect, the package is moisture<br>
permeable.<br>
The present applicant has found that a non woven fabric impregnated with an enzyme<br>
composition provides an efficient means for wiping clean the outside of an endoscope.<br>
In initial experiments, the non woven was impregnated with a known enzyme/detergent<br>
composition. Packing the impregnated product dry maintained the activity of the<br>
enzymes during storage and transport of the product but carried an unacceptable risk of<br>
releasing dry proteases into the atmosphere, an inhalation safety hazard, when the<br>
package was opened. Accordingly, it was thought necessary to moisten the impregnating<br><br>
enzyme/detergent composition. This in turn required that each moist impregnated fabric<br>
be packaged within a water impermeable barrier to prevent the device from drying out.<br>
However that added significantly to the cost. The inventor then discovered that if the<br>
device was impregnated with a humectant, a moisture permeable package could be<br>
employed and the humectant ensured that sufficient water was absorbed in the<br>
composition to prevent dry proteases from becoming a hazard when the package was<br>
opened or the product used. Surprisingly, the activity of the enzymes was maintained<br>
during storage. The product can then be simply removed from its package, wet under a<br>
tap, and then wrapped around the end of an endoscope. The device is then slid along the<br>
length of the endoscope to remove soiling. The product can be manufactured and<br>
packaged at sufficiently low cost to be considered disposable after a single use.<br>
A further advantage of devices according to the invention is that enzymatic action<br>
commences during the scrub phase, that is to say at an earlier stage in the cleaning<br>
process than has been practiced in the past, and thereby prolonging the overall enzyme<br>
treatment time and in turn increasing cleaning efficacy.<br>
According to a fourth aspect the invention provides a method of cleaning the exterior<br>
surface of a surgical instrument in need thereof, said method including the steps of:<br>
(i) wiping the exterior surface, wherein a resilient pad or a wipe is pressed<br>
against an exterior surface of the surgical instrument and slid longitudinally to<br>
mechanically remove gross soiling and at the same time redistribute any residue<br>
remaining to a substantially uniform thickness., while at the same time;<br>
(ii) subjecting the surface to treatment with an enzyme and a surfactant.<br><br><br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS	<br>
Figure 1 is a schematic diagram showing a first embodiment of a device according to the<br>
invention in plan view.<br>
Figure 2 is a schematic diagram showing the embodiment of figure 1 in cross sectional<br>
elevation.<br>
Figure 3 is a schematic diagram showing the device of figures 1,2 in cross-sectional<br>
elevation wrapped circumferentially around an endoscope tube.<br>
BEST MODES FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
A preferred embodiment will now be described by way of example only with reference<br>
to the drawings. The embodiment exemplified in figures 1 and 2 provides a cleaning<br>
device in the form of a pad 1 made from a non woven needle felted polyester or viscose<br>
fabric 2 bonded to a woven backing which can be made of polyester or polypropylene<br>
fibres 3 on one surface. Pad 1 is of substantially rectangular shape having a width<br>
dimension V of approximately 133 mm and a length dimension "1" of approximately 9<br>
cm, and is approximately 15mm thick at its thickest dimension "t". The pad is heat<br>
sealed around its perimeter and has two arcuate grooves 4, 5 of approximately<br>
semicircular cross-section formed by heat moulding and extending in the length direction<br>
centred at intervals of approximately one quarter "w" and three quarters "w" from one<br>
edge 6. The grooves each have a radius of approx. 7mm. In addition there is a fold<br>
groove 8 extending in the length direction on the midline, i.e. at a distance of hal "w"<br>
from side edge 6.<br>
9<br><br>
In use, an endoscope tube is pressed into groove 4 bringing the pad into contact with a<br>
semicircle of the endoscope cross-section. The pad is then folded over, as shown<br>
schematically in fig 3, so that groove 5 contacts the remainder of the cross-section.<br>
Figure 3 shows the pad of figures 1,2 folded along groove 8 so that grooves 4,5 are<br>
brought into registration forming a cylindrical tunnel about an endoscope tube 9 which in<br>
the present example has an outside diameter of approx. 14 mm. The polyester or viscose<br>
needle felt structure has a degree of resilience, and the pad may be held around the<br>
endoscope tube in a manner which compresses the pad exerting a resilient force acting<br>
radially towards the tubular axis of the endoscope. The pad is thus pressed against the<br>
exterior endoscope surface while the device is slid longitudinally to mechanically<br>
remove gross soiling and at the same time the pad redistributes any residue evenly on the<br>
surface, that is to say distributes it substantially uniformly in thickness about the<br>
circumference and along the length. It will be understood that the dimensions of the pad<br>
and grooves may be altered to suit different endoscopes, but an advantage of the design<br>
is that the resilience of the pad accommodates a range of endoscope diameters.<br>
An example of a suitable pad is composed of two different fibres, the first of which is<br>
polyester or viscose of 3 denier and a fibre length of 51 mm and the second of which is<br>
polypropylene of 2 denier and a fibre length of 51 mm. The ratio of the two fibres is<br>
70% polyester or viscose and 30% polypropylene. These two fibres are mixed till<br>
homogeneous and then tangled by the needling technique until a low density web with<br>
substantially no free fly away fibres has been formed.<br><br><br>
The thickness of the web is controlled by the amount of fibre and the needling equipment<br>
employed, however a web of between 5 mm and 15 mm has proved to be ideal for the<br>
application. The dry web is impregnated with a hygroscopic enzyme cleaning<br>
formulation containing one or more enzymes, one or more surfactants, an enzyme<br>
stabilising system and can contain a disinfectant compatible with the enzymes employed.<br>
In a second embodiment not illustrated the pad is provided with a slit through which an<br>
endoscope tube may be threaded and held in a clamped manner to similar effect<br>
Although it is preferred to provide a pad with two grooves and to fold the pad, two<br>
separate pads each with a groove could be similarly employed.<br>
Devices may be manufactured with grooves of different dimensions to accommodate<br>
instruments of differing diameter, althougfc. the resilience of the pad permits the device to<br>
be used satisfactorily with instruments ovar a range of diameters.<br>
In highly preferred embodiments, the pad is impregnated with a composition such as that<br>
set out in example 1.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
%w/w<br>
Non-ionic surfactant (e.g. nonyl phenol ethoxylate)	10.0<br>
Anionic surfactant (e.g. linear alcohol sulphonate)	10.0<br>

The activity units for the enzymes used in Example 1 are:<br>
Protease 16 KNPU/gm or 5 AU/gm<br>
Amylase 300 KNU/gm<br>
Cellulase 1000 ECU/gm<br>
Lipase	100 KLU/gm<br>
Those skilled in the art will appreciate that enzymes are supplied on the basis of activity<br>
units rather than protein concentration, and that the units used to define activity differ<br>
depending upon the specific chemistry of the enzyme involved. However, those skilled<br>
in the art will be familiar with reformulating enzymes of different activity and will be<br>
readily able to adapt the formulations of the present invention according to the specific<br>
circumstances.<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
Example 2 is identical to example 1 except that 4.5%w/ w glycerine is substituted for<br>
Calcium chloride hexahydrate<br><br><br>
The surfactants, preservatives and enzymes can be varied in composition and quantity in<br>
accordance with formulation and compatibility requirements. Importantly, the<br>
composition contains a humectant. Suitable humectants may for example be calcium<br>
chloride, sodium chloride, glycerine, borax, ethylene glycol or such like. The humectant<br>
may also be a surfactant.<br>
One or more of the pads is packed together in a package which may be water permeable<br>
This together with the presence of the humectant serves to keep the composition<br>
sufficiently moist to avoid dry particles of enzyme from being released into the air when<br>
the package is opened. Optionally, the formulation may contain a disinfectant<br>
compatible with the enzymes, for example a quaternary ammonium compound.<br>
The loading of composition on the fabric, wipe or sponge can be varied as desired. The<br>
composition can be applied in any ratio, from a small amount, 1 to 5% of the weight of<br>
the fabric, wipe or sponge right up to an amount which fully saturates the pad or wipe.<br>
In use, a device according to the invention is removed from its package and may be.<br>
further dampened with water, wrapped cireumferentially around an end of the endoscope<br>
and wiped along the endoscope length to remove soiling. The pad is then disposed of in<br>
a suitable manner. The enzymes commence digestive action immediately.<br>
The endoscope, now free of most of the adherent soiling, is further cleaned in a suitable<br>
cleaning solution and then disinfected or sterilized. Because any residue is now<br>
distributed as a thin film of uniform thickness, subsequent treatment in a bath is effective<br><br><br>
in a shorter time than would be the case if the exterior were merely scrubbed with a<br>
brush.<br>
Although the above discussed embodiment employs a viscose fibre pad, it is envisaged<br>
that the pad could be made from a polymeric foam or suitable textile paper or hybrid<br>
structure. However it is desirable that the device be not too absorbent since it is<br>
desirable that the instrument remain moist.<br>
A very highly preferred embodiment uses a roll of non-woven fabric "wipes'. The roll<br>
is, for example, 8 meters long, and 10 cm wide and is perforated at 10 cm intervals, so<br>
that up to 80 wipes of 10cmx 10 cm can be torn from a free end of the roll.<br>
Alternatively, the product may be supplied in a canister containing 200 wipes in an 8<br>
meter roll. The non woven fabric used in the wipes is a made from a cellulosic fibre (for<br>
example viscose) web. This web is then treated with an aqueous dispersion of a flexible<br>
cross-linking acrylic latex. The aqueous dispersion is such as to incorporate up to 15%<br>
by weight and preferably about 8% by weight of dry acrylic polymer. Upon the addition<br>
of a suitable proportion of a cross-linking catalyst; the non-woven structure is saturated<br>
with the latex/catalyst dispersion and excess dispersion drained from the structure by<br>
gravity, or else squeezed out with the assistance of compression rollers whereupon the<br>
structure is then dried at a temperature appropriate to induce cross-linking. Upon<br>
cooling a bonded, non-woven, open structured web has been achieved, and has the<br>
following specification:<br>
Basic mass (g./sq.m): about 42.5<br>
Dry strength: (g/25 mm): 225<br><br><br>
Thickness (um/4ply): 1270<br>
Absorbency (g/5g): 420<br>
The roll of wipes is contained in a dispensing canister which is preferably moulded from<br>
plastic, has a diameter only slightly larger than the roll diameter and has a replaceable<br>
closure which seals with the container. Under the replaceable closure is a canister lid or<br>
wall provided with one or more slits disposed about the roll axis through which an end<br>
of the roll can be dispensed. A formulation such as shown in example 1 or example 2,<br>
and containing an enzyme and a humectant, is added to the container in sufficient<br>
quantity to impregnate the non woven fabric. Thereafter, wipes may be pulled from the<br>
canister and torn off the roll end as needed. In use, an impregnated wipe is held in the<br>
gloved hand, moistened under a tap, and then used to wipe the exterior surface of an<br>
instrument to be cleaned. By virtue of the slits the container is moisture permeable. An<br>
additional outer removable closure may be provided to exclude particles and to inhibit<br>
moisture loss. However the slits ensure that the moisture can permeate the package.<br>
As will be apparent to those skilled in the art from the teaching hereof use of a device or<br>
wipe according to the invention provide a major advance in convenience and efficacy<br>
over existing methods for cleaning eadoscopes. The device or wipe maybe used for<br>
cleaning other medical and non medical instruments, surfaces, and the like. The device<br>
or wipe may be embodied in other forms or be manufactured from other materials<br>
without departing from the inventive concept herein disclosed and the formulation may<br>
be varied without departing from the invention.<br><br>
