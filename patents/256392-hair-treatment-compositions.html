COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
(See Section 10 and Rule 13)<br><br><br>
HAIR TREATMENT COMPOSITIONS<br>
HINDUSTAN UNILEVER LIMITED, a company incorporated under the Indian Companies Act, 1913 and having its registered office at Hindustan Lever House, 165/166, Backbay Reclamation, Mumbai -400 020, Maharashtra, India<br><br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed<br><br><br>
WO 2007/068400<br><br>
PCT/EP2006/011815<br><br>
HAIR TREATMENT COMPOSITIONS<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION 5<br>
The invention relates to hair treatment compositions which comprise a combination of a sugar, an aliphatic amino acid and a basic amino acid. The compositions are particularly 10  suitable for the treatment of hair which is dry, damaged and/or prone to manageability problems.<br>
BACKGROUND AND PRIOR ART<br>
15<br>
Hair can suffer damage from a number of sources. For example, environmental sources of hair damage include such as exposure to UV and chlorine. Chemical sources of hair damage include treatments such as bleaching, perming and<br>
20  straightening, and overly frequent washing with harsh<br>
surfactant-based cleansing shampoo compositions. Mechanical sources of hair damage include excessive brushing and combing and prolonged use of heated appliances for drying and styling the hair.<br>
25<br>
Damage to the hair typically manifests itself in cuticle and protein loss from the hair fibre, hair fibre dryness, hair fibre brittleness and breakage and frayed or split ends. Dry, damaged hair is particularly prone to manageability<br>
30  problems, resulting in symptoms such as "flyaway" hair which<br><br>
WO 2007/068400<br><br>
PCT7EP2006/011815<br><br>
-   2   -<br>
is difficult to style or which does not retain a style, especially under conditions such as high humidity.<br>
Various organic molecules and combinations thereof have been 5  suggested for use in the treatment of dry, damaged and/or unmanageable hair.<br>
For example, WO 2004054 526 describes hair treatment compositions for the care and repair of damaged hair, and 10  for improving hair manageability, comprising a disaccharide, (in particular trehalose), and a diacid (in particular adipic acid).<br>
WO 2004054525 describes hair treatment compositions for the 15  care and repair of damaged hair, and for improving hair manageability, comprising a disaccharide (in particular trehalose), and a diol (in particular 3-methyl-l,3-butanediol).<br>
20  WO 2004006874 describes hair treatment compositions for<br>
repairing and preventing the principal symptoms of damaged hair, comprising specific branched amine and/or hydroxy compounds (in particular 3,3-dimethyl-l,2-butanediol).<br>
25  The present inventors have found that hair treatment compositions comprising a combination of a sugar, an aliphatic amino acid and a basic amino acid show improved efficacy in the, treatment of hair which is dry, damaged and/or prone to manageability problems.<br>

The present invention provides a hair treatment composition comprising a combination of a sugar, an aliphatic amino acid 5  and a basic amino acid.<br>
The invention also provides the use of the above composition in the treatment of dry, damaged and/or unmanageable hair.<br>
10  The invention also provides a method of treating hair by applying the above composition to the hair.<br>

10  Cationic Polymers<br>
Cationic polymers are preferred ingredients in a shampoo composition of the invention for enhancing conditioning performance.<br>
15<br>
Suitable cationic polymers may be homopolymers which are cationically substituted or may be formed from two or more types of monomers.  The weight average (Mw) molecular weight of the polymers will generally be between 100 000 and 2<br>
20  million daltons.  The polymers will have cationic nitrogen containing groups such as quaternary ammonium or protonated amino groups, or a mixture thereof.  If the molecular weight of the polymer is too low, then the conditioning effect is poor.  If too high, then there may be problems of high<br>
25  extensional viscosity leading to stringiness of the composition when it is poured.<br>
The cationic nitrogen-containing group will generally be present as a substituent on a fraction of the total monomer 30  units of the cationic polymer.  Thus when the polymer is not a homopolymer it can contain spacer non-cationic monomer<br><br>
WO 2007/068400<br><br>
PCT/EP2006/011815<br><br>
-   15  -<br>
units.  Such polymers are described in the CTFA Cosmetic Ingredient Directory, 3rd edition.  The ratio of the cationic to non-cationic monomer units is selected to give polymers having a cationic charge density in the required range, which 5  is generally from 0.2 to 3.0 meq/gm. The cationic charge density of the polymer is suitably determined via the Kjeldahl method as described in the US Pharmacopoeia under chemical tests for nitrogen determination.<br>
0  Suitable cationic polymers include, for example, copolymers of vinyl monomers having cationic amine or quaternary ammonium functionalities with water soluble spacer monomers such as (meth)acrylamide, alkyl and dialkyl (meth)acrylamides, alkyl (meth)acrylate, vinyl caprolactone<br>
5  and vinyl pyrrolidine.  The alkyl and dialkyl substituted<br>
monomers preferably have C1-C7 alkyl groups, more preferably Cl-3 alkyl groups.  Other suitable spacers include vinyl esters, vinyl alcohol, maleic anhydride, propylene glycol and ethylene glycol.<br>
0<br>
The cationic amines can be primary, secondary or tertiary amines, depending upon the particular species and the pH of the composition.  In general secondary and tertiary amines, especially tertiary, are preferred.<br>
5<br>
Amine substituted vinyl monomers and amines can be polymerised in the amine form and then converted to ammonium by quaternization.<br><br>

PCT/EP2006/011815<br><br>
-   16   -<br>
The cationic polymers can comprise mixtures of monomer units derived from amine- and/or quaternary ammonium-substituted monomer and/or compatible spacer monomers.<br>

(ii)     an acid.<br>
As used herein, the term hydrocarbyl chain means an alkyl or alkenyl chain. 5<br>
Preferred amidoamine compounds are those corresponding to formula (I) in which<br>
R1 is a hydrocarbyl residue having from about 11 to about 24 10  carbon atoms,<br>
R2 and R3 are each independently hydrocarbyl residues,<br>
preferably alkyl groups, having from 1 to about 4 carbon<br>
atoms, and<br>
m is an integer from 1 to about 4. 15<br>
Preferably, R2 and R3 are methyl or ethyl groups.<br>

PCT/EP2006/011815<br><br>
-   23   -<br>
amidoethyldiethylamine, arachidamidoethyldimethylamine, and mixtures thereof.<br>
Particularly preferred amidoamines useful herein are 5  stearamidopropyldimethylamine, stearamidoethyldiethylamine, and mixtures thereof.<br>
Commercially available amidoamines useful herein include: stearamidopropyldimethylamine with tradenames LEXAMINE S-13<br>
10  available from Inolex (Philadelphia Pennsylvania, USA) and AMIDOAMINE MSP available from Nikko (Tokyo, Japan), stearamidoethyldiethylamine with a tradename AMIDOAMINE S available from Nikko, behenamidopropyldimethylamine with a tradename INCROMINE BB available from Croda (North<br>

Acid (ii) may be any organic or mineral acid which is 20  capable of protonating the amidoamine in the hair treatment composition.  Suitable acids useful herein include hydrochloric acid, acetic acid; tartaric acid, fumaric acid, lactic acid, malic acid, succinic acid, and mixtures thereof.  Preferably, the acid is selected from the group 25  consisting of acetic acid, tartaric acid, hydrochloric acid, fumaric acid, and mixtures thereof.<br>
The primary role of the acid is to protonate the amidoamine in the hair treatment composition thus forming a tertiary 30  amine salt (TAS) in situ in the hair treatment composition.<br><br>
WO 2007/068400<br><br>
PCT/EP2006/011815<br><br>
-   24   -<br>
The TAS in effect is a non-permanent quaternary ammonium or pseudo-quaternary ammonium cationic surfactant -<br>
Suitably, the acid is included in a sufficient amount to 5  protonate all the amidoamine present, i.e. at a level which is at least equimolar to the amount of amidoamine present in the composition.<br>
In conditioners of the invention, the level of cationic 0  conditioning surfactant will generally range from 0.01 to<br>
10%, more preferably 0.05 to 7.5%, most preferably 0.1 to 5% by total weight of cationic conditioning surfactant based on the total weight of the composition.<br>
5  Conditioners of the invention will typically also incorporate a fatty alcohol.  The combined use of fatty alcohols and cationic surfactants in conditioning compositions is believed to be especially advantageous, because this leads to the formation of a lamellar phase, in which the cationic<br>
0  surfactant is dispersed.<br>
Representative fatty alcohols comprise from 8 to 22 carbon atoms, more preferably 16 to 22.  Fatty alcohols are typically compounds containing straight chain alkyl groups. 5  Examples of suitable fatty alcohols include cetyl alcohol, stearyl alcohol and mixtures thereof. The use of these materials is also advantageous in that they contribute to the overall conditioning properties of compositions of the invention.<br><br>
WO 2007/068400<br><br>
PCT/EP2006/011815<br><br>
-   25   -<br>
The level of fatty alcohol in conditioners of the invention will generally range from 0.01 to 10%, preferably from 0.1 to 8%, more preferably from 0.2 to 7%, most preferably from 0.3 to 6% by weight of the composition.  The weight ratio of 5  cationic surfactant to fatty alcohol is suitably from 1:1 to 1:10, preferably from 1:1.5 to 1:8, optimally from 1:2 to 1:5. If the weight ratio of cationic surfactant to fatty alcohol is too high, this can lead to eye irritancy from the composition. If it is too low, it can make the hair feel 10  squeaky for some consumers.<br>
Hair Oils and Lotions<br>
Compositions of the invention may suitably take the form of a 15  hair oil, for pre-wash or post-wash use. Typically, hair oils will predominantly comprise water-insoluble oily conditioning materials, such as triglycerides, mineral oil and mixtures thereof.<br>
20  Compositions of the invention may also take the form of a<br>
hair lotion, typically for use in between washes. Lotions are aqueous emulsions comprising water-insoluble oily conditioning materials.  Suitable surfactants can also be included in lotions to improve their stability to phase<br>
25  separation.<br>
Silicone Conditioning Agents<br>
Hair treatment compositions according to the invention, 30  particularly water-based shampoos and hair conditioners, will<br><br>

The emulsion droplets may typically have a Sauter mean droplet diameter (D3,2) in the composition of the invention 15  ranging from 0.01 to 20 micrometer, more preferably from 0.2 to 10 micrometer.<br>
A suitable method for measuring the Sauter mean droplet diameter (D3f2) is by laser light scattering using an 20  instrument such as a Malvern Mastersizer.<br>
Suitable silicone emulsions for use in compositions of the invention are available from suppliers of silicones such as Dow Corning and GE Silicones. The use of such pre-formed<br>
25  silicone emulsions is preferred for ease of processing and control of silicone particle size. Such pre-formed silicone emulsions will typically additionally comprise a suitable emulsifier such as an anionic or nonionic emulsifier, or mixture thereof, and may be prepared by a chemical<br>
30  emulsification process such as emulsion polymerisation, or by mechanical emulsification using a high shear mixer. Pre-<br><br>

15  weight have been blended with the silicone emulsion<br>
droplets, as described for example in WO03/094874. In such materials, the silicone emulsion droplets are preferably formed from polydiorganosiloxanes such as those described above. One preferred form of the surface active block<br>
20  copolymer is according to the following formula:<br>
HO (CH2CH20) X (CH (CH3) CH20)y(CH2CH20)x H<br>
wherein the mean value of x is 4 or more and the mean value<br>
25  of y is 25 or more.<br>
Another preferred form of the surface active block copolymer is according to the following formula:<br>
30   (HO(CH2CH20)a(CH(CH3)CH20)b)2-N-CH2-CH2-N((OCH2CH(CH3) )b(OCH2CH2)a OH)2<br><br>
WO 2007/068400<br><br>
PC17EP2Q06/011815<br><br>
-   28   -<br>
wherein the mean value of a is 2 or more and the mean value of b is 6 or more.<br>
