				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The invention generally relates to the removal of a heat sink adapter. More particularly, this invention relates to a tool for removing the heat sink adapter, which is press fitted to a Ball Grid Array (BGA).<br>
BACK GROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Several tools are available to fix the heat sink to various packages including BGAs. One such heat sink fixed for the BGA's is as shown in Fig 1 where the heat sink adapter is press fitted to the BGA and the heat sink is screwed to the adapter so that a contact is made with the surface of the BGA in order to remove heat from the BGA. However, many a time the same method cannot facilitate removal of the heat sinks along with the adapter either for rework or to replace a faulty BGA.<br>
The present invention provides a solution to the above in the form of a tool. The said tool helps in removing the heat sink adapter either to replace the faulty BGA or to rework a BGA, which has gone faulty without damaging the adapter.<br>
PRIOR ART<br>
Ball Grid Arrays (BGAs) is a surface mount package that utilizes an array of metal spheres or balls as the means of providing external electrical connection between the die of the device and the PCB foot print.   The balls are composed of solder alloy and are<br><br>
attached to a laminated substance at the bottom side of the package. The BGA provides a packaging solution for integrated circuits with high inter connection density. Heat sinks are used on the BGA's to reduce the heat dissipated by the BGA or to enhance the packages to handle excess heat.<br>
As there is no mechanical means to fix the heat sink (which consists of a mounting clip or adapter which has four legs and a circular cutout at the centre with screw thread to screw the heatsink), the adapter is, press fitted to the said BGA.<br>
Electronic devices must be removed and replaced from time to time, and so it is necessary that the heat dissipating assembly should be easy to remove and install without sacrificing reliability or effectiveness (refer: US Pat. 5617292).<br>
PRESENT INVENTION<br>
It is preferred that any securing method devised allow for quick and easy attachment and removal of the heat dissipating device which providing a secure attachment during operation and normal handling. The present invention relates to<br>
•	Generally to the improved heat sink adapter removal tool,<br>
•	Extracting the heat sink adapter from a Ball Grid Array during BGA rework.<br>
•	Printed circuit board (PCB) rework especially for BGA rework and replacement with a new ball grid arrays (BGAs).<br>
•	A new tool which is simple and easy to use.<br><br>
•	Avoids damages to the BGA heat sink adapter and protects from breaking the same.<br>
•	These types of tool avoid the tampering of PCB and solder joint deformation of the BGA and can be used for all existing packages.<br>
ADVANTAGES OF THE PRESENT INVENTION OVER THE EXISTING<br>
No specific tools are available in the market to remove the heat sink /heat sink adapters but tools arc available to fix adapters. If a BGA with a heat sink has to be reworked. One needs to unscrew the heat sink and then remove the adapter before the faulty BGA is removed for rework or replace. Generally tweezers or screwdrivers are used to lift the adapter, which may cause damage to the adapter or its legs, or even breaks it and the same cannot be reused. In order to avoid the breakage and spoil the adapter (as it has to be reused), caution needs to be taken for the removal of the adapter. Sometimes a pair of tweezers or screwdriver or a small metal blade or metal wire is used to pry the heat sink adapter off. The initial penetration of the blade should reach far enough so that the blade has leverage to exert upward pressure against the adapter. When such tools are used to extract the adapter from the BGA, which is soldered on the PCB, several problems arise. The problems may be breaking of the adapter itself, tampering the PCB and disturbing the BGA solder joints and also adjacent components on the PCB.Such practice of using tools, which are not related for the purpose, create enormous damages, material wastage, wastage of time, etc. The present invention relates to this removed tool, which can be used to dislodge the adapter without damaging it.<br><br>
Another deficiency in using such mismatched tools is that it is hazardous like slipping and flying of broken particles.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE TOOL<br>
The invention is particularly configured to aid in the removal of the heat sink adapter. The removal tool has a pair of fin plates pivotally attached together, with each fin plate having different edge sizes. Once the tool is inserted into the holes of the heat sink adapter, a slight squeeze of the two fin plates grips the adapter and disengages the adapter from the BGA without damaging it.<br>
The usage of the tool enhances the ease of rework thus saving significant cost to the company on rework. The rework is carried out without compromising quality. There is no better way to salvage the costly investment by using the tool and keeping the program on schedule.<br>
Heat sink Adapter Removal Tool for BGA (Ball Grid Array) is used for removal of the adapter without damages. The tool is very handy and simple to operate. The Adapter Removal Tool has a pair of stainless steel fin-like plates pivotably joined together by a pivot rod, which is fixed at the center of the plates loosely through the holes at the center. The pivot rod is made out of stainless steel, which is coated with insulating paint. The fin plates are bent outwards in an angle with a cut out at the center of the bottom and top edges of the plate to have a hold on the slots provided on the adapter. The edges of the<br><br>
plates at the top and bottom are curved to hold comfortably and press together to extract the adapter. It is flexible for all existing packages of BGA heat sink adapters. The use of this tool avoids damages of adapter, BGA and tampering of PCB and solder joints of BGA while replacing the faulty BGA or to rework a BGA, which has gone faulty.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>

A pivot rod, which is small in diameter to the holes on which the fin plates are anchored, so as to have free movement of the finplats for the jaws to enter into the slots of the adapter. Wherein the pivot rod is bent to a curved shape so that it does not object while the plates are pressed to release the adapter. A curvature at both the edges of first and second fin plates helps to have a grip within the releasing slots of the adapter. The fin plates that moves across the pivot rod to adjust to different packages. Further, curved edges at the bottom and top of the fin plates allow having grip to the fingers and<br><br>
also inside the adapter slots. The jaws at the top and bottom of the fin plates have cutouts, which are smaller in dimension at one end and larger in dimension at the other end to fit into different sizes of the adapters. The first and second finplates lie adjacent to one another in separate planes when inserted into the adapter, and further comprising first and second finplates having slightly bent to an angle have a cushioning grip to slightly yield the adapter and release the same from the BGA. The finplates having different jaw dimensions can reversibly be used to extract the different adapter packages.<br>
