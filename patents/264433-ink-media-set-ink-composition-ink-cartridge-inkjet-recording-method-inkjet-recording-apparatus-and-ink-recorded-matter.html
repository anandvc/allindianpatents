				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
INK-MEDIA SET, INK COMPOSITION, INK CARTRIDGE, INKJET RECORDING METHOD, INKJET RECORDING APPARATUS, AND<br>
INK RECORDED MATTER<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to an ink-media set and an ink composition that can provide high quality images with higher color saturation and adequate color tone even on recording media with low ink absorbability, and also an inkjet recording method, an inkjet recording apparatus, and an ink recorded matter that utilize the ink-media set.<br>
Background Art<br>
InkJet printers have been certainly become popular by virtue of low ambient noise and low running cost, and color printers capable of printing on regular paper have been remarkably spreading into markets. However, it is very difficult to satisfy all necessary properties including color reproducibility of images, wear resistance, light resistance, gas resistance, water resistance, drying property of images, character spreading (feathering), spreading at color boundary (color bleed), concentration nonuniformity at solid portion (beading), printing ability on both sides, and ejection stability, thus an ink composition and a recording medium are selected depending on prior properties of individual applications.<br><br>
Ink compositions, for inkjct recording, are typically basnd on water to which a colorant and a humectant such as glycerin for preventing clogging are incorporated. The colorant is mainly water soluble dyes capable of clearly coloring.<br>
However, dyes suffer from poor quality non-allowable on regular paper due to inferior light resistance, gas resistance, and water resistance. In order to address this problem, inkjet-exclusive recording paper having an ink absorbing layer has been used and challenged to improve theses resistances, but there still is a problem that the quality is insufficient.<br>
Pigments have been hence employed in recent years from the viewpoint that pigments can provide excellent light resistance, gas resistance, and water resistance. However, the pigments suffer from inferior coloring property compared to dyes. The reason is believed that lights with different wavelengths and phases interfere in the pigments due to optical multiple reflections.<br>
Therefore, there arise such problems as decrease of color saturation in regular paper and decrease of gloss level in inkjet recording paper when the pigments are employed for a colorant of an ink composition for inkjet recording. In order to address these problems, the color saturation is tried to increase by way of making finer the pigment particles or the gloss level is tried to increase by way of coating a polymer on pigment particles; however, there still exists a difference from the dyes in terms of coloring property.<br>
In addition, highly water-absorbable paper such as the regular paper and the inkjet-exclusive recording paper is employed as the<br><br>
recording media for inkjet recording; such paper Lypically exhibits an amount of pure water transferred to the recording media of above 35 ml/m2 at a contact period of 100 ms and above 40 ml/m2 at a contact period of 400 ms by measurement of a dynamic scanning absorptometer.<br>
The regular paper having such high water absorbability is advantageous because of being thin and inexpensive, however, suffers from images with poor coloring property and gloom impression since coloring ingredients of ink compositions easily inGltrate into the paper and thus the amount of coloring ingredients on the surface comes to small. The absorbability of the inkjet-exclusive recording paper can be afforded by way of providing a layer of inorganic pigment or water-absorbable polymer on the surface, thus coloring ingredients can remain around the surface and highly coloring property can be induced; however, the inkjetexclusive recording paper suffers from larger thickness and higher cost beyond comparison with that of the regular paper.<br>
Furthermore, polymer films with no receiving layer on their surface may be exemplified as the recording media. The polymer films typically exhibit an amount of pure water transferred to the recording media of below 2 ml/m2 at a contact period of 100 ms and below 3 ml/m2 at a contact period of 400 ms by measurement of the dynamic scanning absorptometer.<br>
The polymer films as the recording media can scarcely absorb water, thus there often arise such problems as offset smear and ink-void due to spurs (hereinafter sometimes referred to as "spur stain"), beading,<br><br>
and backside smear while stacking, thus the polymer films are far from practical use.<br>
Furthermore, surface-coated paper may be exemplified as the recording media. The surface-coated paper typically exhibits an amount of pure water transferred to the recording media of 2 to 35 ml/m2 at a contact period of 100 ms and 3 to 40 ml/m2 at a contact period of 400 ms by measurement of the dynamic scanning absorptometer. The surface coated paper as the recording media, which being mainly used for such applications as offset printing and gravure printing, has a less thickness and is not so different with regular paper in terms of price. When images are formed on the recording media using aqueous inkjet inks of which colorant is a pigment, high quality images can bo obtained with excellent coloring property and high glossiness since the colorant remains on the surface. However, when the colorant is an aqueous dye, there arises such a problem that the resulting color is of low density and dull since the colorant migrates into substrates (cellulose) through pores of coating layers at the surface together with moisture and aqueous solvent without remaining on the surface.<br>
Furthermore, when pigment inks are employed, highly coloring images can be obtained, however, there arise such problems as spur stain, beading, and backside smear while stacking because of slow drying of ink compositions.<br>
A number of processes are proposed in order to solve the drying of the ink compositions. For example, a process to use a strong alkaline ink is proposed (see Patent Literature l). However, this proposal suffers from such problems as dangerous handling, tendency to decrease<br><br>
significantly fixability of acid-free paper, easy show through, and remarkable difficulty to record both sides.<br>
A recording process is also proposed to use an oil-based ink composition containing a water-insoluble organic solvent as a liquid medium. However, this proposal is Limited to industrial applications in spite of excellent fixability since countermeasures for odor and safety as regards the organic solvent are essential, thus is far from the situation to be employed in offices and general homes.<br>
A process to use an ink composition is proposed in which the ink composition contains a large amount of a surfactant or a surfactant with a lower surface tension (see Patent Literature 2). The ink composition of this proposal may exhibit an excellent drying velocity after printing compared to those of conventional ink compositions, however, hands may be stained upon taking promptly by hand the matters printed at recording apparatuses depending on the species of papers, or significant feathering may occur depending on the species of papers.<br>
A recording process is also proposed in which an ink composition, which being a wax-like solid at normal temperature, is heated and ejected to record under a molten condition (see Patent Literature 3). However, this proposal leads to convex portions of printed characters, which arises such problems as the printed characters transfer and/or papers stick together when a number of the printed matters are stacked and left to stand. In addition, a heating unit is necessary to heat the ink composition, which making the apparatus complicated.<br>
A process to promote the drying is also proposed in which recording paper is heated after printing characters (see Patent<br><br>
Literature 4). However, this proposal suffers from larger electricity consumption since heating rollers and warm-air blowers are necessary, which making difficult to be used in offices or general homos.<br>
As described above, colorants on the basis of dyes exhibit excellent coloring property compared to colorants on the basis of pigments, but represent non-allowable quality when combined with regular paper because the light resistance, gas resistance, and water resistance are inferior as described above.<br>
In order to address the light resistance, gas resistance, and water resistance, processes to use a colorant arc proposed in which a dye is dissolved or included into a polymer fine particle to form a colorant (see Patent Literatures 5 to 8). The dye is essentially water-insoluble in these proposals, and the water resistance and the gas resistance are equivalent with those of pigments along with maintaining the highly coloring property of dyes. However, these proposals are limited to recording on regular paper or inkjet-exclusive recording paper, and there arise such problems as occurrences of beading and insufficient drying property when being recorded on recording media with a lower absorbability, specifically, on those of which the amount of pure water transferred to the recording media is below 4 ml/m2 at a contact period of 100 ms and below 5 ml/m2 at a contact period of 400 ms.<br>
In order to solve the problem of drying property in cases where colorants on the basis of dyes are applied to recording media with a lower absorbability, a process is also proposed in which the dye is included into polymer emulsion and the viscosity of an aqueous ink composition is raised (see Patent, Literature 9). This proposal may be effective for<br><br>
recording paper with higher absorbability since higher viscosity loads to higher solid content of ink compositions as well as more prompt drying, but is insufficient for recording media with lower absorbability.<br>
Accordingly, the development of an ink media set is currently demanded that can provide high quality images with higher color saturation and adequate color tone not only on regular paper and inkjet-exclusive recording paper but also on recording media with low ink absorbability.<br>
The recording media for inkjet recording exhibit higher ink absorbability similarly as the regular paper and inkjet-exclusive recording paper, and correspond to those of which the amount of pure water transferred to the recording media is in general above 15 ml/m2 at a contact period of 100 ms and above 20 ml/m2 at a contact period of 400 ms by measurement of the dynamic scanning absorptometer. The regular paper with such adequate absorbability is advantageously thin and inexpensive, however, there arise such problems as show through occurs since color ingredients of inks tend to infiltrate into paper and the coloring property is poor and the images induce gloom impression since the amount of coloring ingredients on the surface comes to small. On the other hand, the exclusive recording paper is provided with the absorbability by way of placing a layer of inorganic pigment or water-absorbable polymer on the surface, thus coloring ingredients can remain around the surface and highly coloring property can be induced; however, the inkjet-exclusive recording paper suffers from larger thickness and higher cost beyond comparison with that of the regular paper.<br><br>
On the contrary, as regards the recording media that exhibit little ink absorbability such that the amount of ink composition transferred to the recording media is below 4 ml/m2 at a contact period of 100 ms and below 7 ml/m2 at a contact period of 400 ms by measurement of the dynamic scanning absorptometer, polymer films with no receiving layer on their surface may be exemplified as such recording media. The polymer films as the recording media can scarcely absorb inks, thus there often arise such problems as offset smear and ink-void due to spurs, beading, and backside smear while stacking, thus the polymer films are far from practical use.<br>
As regards the recording media having an intermediate ink absorbability among the recording media described above such that the amount of ink composition transferred to the recording media is 4 to 15 ml/m2 at a contact period of 100 ms and 7 to 20 ml/m" at a contact period of 400 ms by measurement of the dynamic scanning absorptometer, surface-coated paper is exemplified that is mainly used for such applications as offset printing and gravure printing. These recording media are thin and the price is not so different from that of regular paper. There arise in these recording media such problems as occurrences of spur stain, beading, and backside smear while stacking since the drying of inks is slow in these recording media.<br>
When images are formed on these recording media using aqueous inkjet inks, there arise such problems as heavy bleeding and show through, lower density, and gloom coloring, since the colorant under a dissolved condition like water-soluble dyes migrates into substrates (cellulose) through pores of coating layers at the surface<br><br>
together with moisture and aqueous solvent without remaining on the surface.<br>
When the colorant represents a dispersed condition like pigments, the coloring property may be excellent compared to those of water-soluble dyes since the colorant remains on the surface; however, the poor coloring property cannot be improved inherently to pigments, resulting in images with unsatisfactory coloring property.<br>
On the other hand, when water-insoluble dyes such as oil-soluble dyes and disperse dyes are used in a dispersed condition, clear coloring can often be obtained since the colorant can remain at the surface, thus the water-insoluble dyes are considered to be most adequate for recording media with lower absorbability. However, the water-insoluble dye may dissolve into an organic solvent in inks thus the water-insoluble dye partially dissolves into an ink vehicle, and the dye under a dissolved condition causes coloring of clear color inherent to the dye. Therefore, there arise such problems as occurrences of bleeding and show through, low density, and gloom coloring similarly as water-soluble dyes when the dissolved content of dyes is excessive.<br>
As regards the process to solve the problems in terms of the drying property described above, a recording process is proposed to use an oil-based ink composition containing a water insoluble organic solvent as a liquid medium; however, this proposal is limited to industrial applications in spite of excellent fixability since countermeasures for odor and safety as regards the organic solvent are essential, thus is far from the situation to be employed in offices and general homes.<br><br>
In order to improve the light resistance, gas resistance, and water resistance of dyes, Patent Literatures 5 to 8 propose colorants in which a dye is dissolved or included into a polymer fine particle. Patent Literature 10 proposes to further add an inorganic pigment. Those proposals make possihle to take the water resistance and the gas resistance equivalent with those of pigments, however, their applications are limited to recording on the regular paper and the inkjet-exclusive recording paper, and do not address the problems such as heading and drying property where recording is carried out on recording media with lower absorbability like the present invention.<br>
Patent Literature 11 proposes that a pigment ink or a fine particle ink of colored polymer, where a dye being covered by a polymer, is printed on recording media with lower absorbability such as art paper and printing paper like those of the present, invention. However, (he invention concerns to an ink where the colorant is substantially insoluble into ink vehicle and dispersed in a particulate condition, and does not refers that the coloring property can be enhanced by way of dissolving partially the colorant like the present invention.<br>

Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
The present inventors have investigated vigorously to solve the problems described above and consequently the present invention has been made.<br>
That is, the present invention relates to the ink composition, in which the ink composition comprises an organic solvent and a colorant, and the colorant is substantially insoluble in water and soluble in the organic solvent, the colorant exists in a dispersed condition and a dissolved condition in water and the organic solvent, and the amount, of the colorant in the dissolved condition after separating by way of ultrafiltration, of which molecular mass cut off being 50,000, is no more than 10% based on total amount of the colorant in the ink composition; and it has been found that high quality images with higher color saturation and adequate color tone can be obtained without spreading or show through at supports (media) when the ink composition is applied to the recording medium that comprises a support and a coating layer on at least, one side of the support, and the amount of the ink composition transferred to the recording medium is 4 ml/m2 to 15 ml/m2 at a contact period of 100 ms and the amount of the ink composition transferred to<br><br>
the recording medium is 7 ml/m2 to 20 ml/m2 at a contact period of 400 ms by measurement of the dynamic scanning absorptometer.<br>
When images are formed on a recording medium with low ink absorbability like the present invention, water-insoluble dyes such as oil-soluble dyes and disperse dyes may exhibit more excellent coloring property than water-soluble dyes and pigments. The water-insoluble dyes may represent a solubility to organic solvents in inks thus exhibit a partially dissolved condition. When the soluble content is no more than 10% based on the total amount of the colorant in the ink, more preferably 0.5% to 3%, the problems of spreading or show through may be prevented to occur and also high quality images with higher color saturation and adequate color tone can be obtained because of inherent clear coloring of the partially dissolved dyes.<br>
In order to adjust the soluble amount of colorants, the selection of the organic solvent is important; examples of the organic solvent, suited to the present invention to prevent excessive elution, include glycerin, trimethylolpropane, glycol ether, triethylene glycol, propylene glycol, dipropylene glycol, 1,3-butanediol, 3-metlhy]-l,3-butanediol, 2-pyrrolidone, N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone, and polyols having 8 or more carbon atoms.<br>
Furthermore, the water-insoluble dyes may lead to images with clear coloring property comparable with water-insoluble dyes even on regular paper and exclusive recording paper and water resistance may be improved to the level of pigments. In addition, the light resistance and the gas resistance may be enhanced by way of incorporating the dye into<br><br>
polymers or preparing a condition of dispersed particle with inorganic pigment particles.<br>
That is, the ink composition, the ink-media set, the inkjet recording method, and the recorded matter can bo provided that form images higher color saturation and adequate color tone compared to those of pigment inks without spreading, show through, or depressing images like aqueous dye inks, even when images are formed on recording media with low ink absorbability in such a condition that the amount of the ink composition transferred to the recording medium is 4 ml/m2 to 15 ml/m2 at a contact period of 100 ms and the amount of the ink composition transferred to the recording medium is 7 ml/m2 to 20 ml/m2 at a contact period of 400 ms.<br>
In addition, as regards the problems that dying is slow for the recording media with low ink absorbability and the setting of colorants is time-consuming, it is possible to provide an ink-media set that can suppress the beading by way of controlling the surface tension of the ink composition to 20 to 35 mN/m. Furthermore, the viscosity adjusted in a range of 5 mPa.s to 50 mPa.s at 25°C may allow the ink to be free from feathering or beading.<br>
The term "beading" in the present invention refers to such a phenomenon of density nonuniformity that ink droplets, ejected onto a surface of a recording medium at inkjet recording, cannot be absorbed entirely into the recording medium till the subsequent ink droplets reach thereto to remain at the surface of the recording medium and mix with the subsequent droplets to make a part of colorant in the ink into blocks thereby to generate the density nonuniformity. There is a relation<br><br>
between the phenomenon and the amount of ink absorbed into the recording medium within a relatively short period of 100 ms at the latest of the contact period in the recent conventional printers; as regards green image portions, for example, the level of beading depends on the amount of Y (yellow) or C (cyan) ink absorbed or transferred to recording medium between from Y or C ink is ejected to C or Y ink is ejected.<br>
The dispersed condition and the dissolved condition are distinguished, in the present invention, from the particle diameter using the boundary level of 5 nm. The border line will be reasonable by reason that the particle diameter of 5 nm approximately corresponds to the molecular mass of about 50,000 in organic materials, and colorants having a molecular mass higher than 50,000 are non-major. The method to distinguish the dispersed condition and the dissolved condition may be based on conventional filtering devices or centrifugal separators most preferably, the ultrafiltration devices are used.<br>
It is preferred in the present invention that the content of the colorant in a dissolved condition, which being separated by ultrafiltration with a molecular mass cut off of 50,000, is no more than 10% based on the total amount of the colorant, more preferably 0.5% to 3%.<br>
When the content of the soluble colorant is more than 10% based on the entire colorant, image spreading (feathering) and/or back printing (show through) unfavorably occurs since the colorant dissolved in an ink vehicle migrates along with infiltration of the vehicle after printing on recording media. The occurrence of these problems depends on the combination with a recording medium and is pronounced when the amount of the ink composition transferred to the recording medium is 4<br><br>
ml/m2 to 15 ml/m2 at a contact period of 100 ms and the amount of the ink composition transferred to the recording medium is 7 ml/m2 to 20 ml/m2 at a contact period of 400 ms by measurement of the dynamic scanning absorptometcr. When the content of the soluble colorant is 3% to 10% based on the entire colorant, the back printing (show through) is unlikely to occur on the recording medium described above, but the image spreading (feathering) may occur in an allowable range. When the content of the soluble colorant is no more than 3% based on the entire colorant, no image spreading (feathering) nor back printing (show through) occurs even on the recording medium described above. Colorants may typically exhibit more excellent coloring property in dissolved condition, and sufficiently clear coloring can be obtained when 0.5% or more of colorant is dissolved even if most of the other is in a dispersed condition. As such, when the content of the soluble colorant is below 0.5% based on the entire colorant, it is undesirable in that the coloring tends to be gloom, although being within an allowable range, in the combination with the recording medium.<br>
In order to make the content of the soluble colorant within the range described above, the solubility of the colorant can be adjusted by way of combining with a polymer. The content of the polymer may be appropriately increased or decreased, or the species of polymer may be properly selected in view of adequate adhesiveness with the dye. In addition, two or three organic solvents may be combined to adjust the solubility of the colorant from the view point of dissolving ability, moisture retainability, permeability, etc. Ink-Media Set<br><br>
The ink-media set according to the present invention comprises the ink composition, the recording medium, and the other optional ingredients.<br>
The ink composition comprises a polymer fine particle containing a dye and an inorganic pigment particle, a water-soluble solvent, and water, and has a surface tension of 20 mN/m to 35 mN/m at 25°C.<br>
The recording medium comprises a support and a coating layer on at least one side of the support, and the amount of pure water transferred to the recording medium is no less than 2 ml/m2 and less than 35 ml/m2 at a contact period of 100 ms and the amount of pure water transferred to the recording medium is no less than 3 ml/m2 and less than 40 ml/m2 at a contact period of 400 ms by measurement of the dynamic scanning absorptometer.<br>
The inkmedia set according to the present, invention comprises the ink composition and the recording medium, consequently, high quality images with higher color saturation and adequate color tone can be obtained even on recording media with low ink absorbability not only on regular paper or inkjet-exclusive recording paper. Ink Composition<br>
The ink composition contains at least a polymer fine particle containing a dye and an inorganic pigment particle, a water-soluble solvent, and water, and also other optional ingredients such as wetting agent.<br>
The ink composition has a surface tension of 20 to 35 mN/m at 25°C, preferably 24 to 30 mN/m. The surface tension in the range of 20 to 35 mN/m may suppress the occurrences of beading and lead to provide<br><br>
an ink-media set that can form images with high fineness and high quality.<br>
The method to measure the surface tension may be properly selected from publicly known ones; for example, the surface tension may be measured by use of a surface tension meter (by Kyowa Interface Science Co., CBVPZ) and a platinum plate at 25°C.<br>
The viscosity of the ink composition is preferably 5 to 50 mPas at 25°C. When the viscosity is below 5 mPa.s, ink droplets tend to spread too wide on the recording medium, resulting possibly in occurrences of beading or color bleed, and when the viscosity is above 50 mPas, ink droplets come to small and some nozzles may eject no ink droplets, which possibly resulting in disordered images. Polymer Fine Particle Containing Dye and Inorganic Pigment Particle<br>
The polymer fine particle containing a dye and an inorganic pigment particle is one where the dye and the inorganic pigment particle are enclosed into the polymer fine particle, one whore the inorganic pigment particle is enclosed into the polymer fine particle to which the surface the dye is adsorbed, or combination of these ones.<br>
The volume average particle diameter of the polymer fine particle containing the dye and the inorganic pigment particle is preferably 5 to 200 nm, more preferably 50 to 150 nm. When the volume average particle diameter is less than 5 nm, it may be difficult to maintain the dispersed condition stably and thus particle coagulation and the accompanying viscosity increase may be induced, and when above 200 nm, the particle may settle out. Dye<br><br>
The dye may be properly selected depending on the application as long as capable of being enclosed into or adsorbed on the polymer fine particle. The dye is preferably water-insoluble and one of oil-soluble dyes and disperse dyes in view of more excellent enclosing property and adsorbing property.

The interface deposition processes, suited to inkjet inks, may be specifically a phase-transfer emulsion process or an acid deposition process.<br><br>
In the phase-transfer emulsion process, a polymer and a water-insoluble dye are dispersed in an organic solvent having low compatibility with water and a boiling point higher than that of water, the polymer is hydrophilized and then emulsified through adding water, followed by distilling away the organic solvent thereby to transfer into an aqueous phase.<br>
In the acid deposition process, a polymer and a water-insoluble dye are dispersed in an aqueous medium, the polymer is hydrophobized through adding an acid thereby to make the polymer adsorbed firmly to the particle of the water-insoluble dye, and a base is applied to the polymer after water-rinsing to hydrophilize again thereby to disperse in an aqueous medium.<br>
Specifically, the acid deposition process is carried out in a way that the polymer is hydrophilized by adding a basic compound to neutralize an acidic group such as carboxylic group and the hydrophilized polymer is dissolved in an aqueous medium, to which a pigment is added and wetted, then the mixture is treated with homogenizers able to stir at high speed, milling and dispersing devices with balls such as bead mills and ball mills, kneading and dispersing devices such as roll mills by means of shear force, or ultrasonic dispersing devices, thereby the pigment particle is dispersed in the aqueous medium in a condition that the pigment particle is enclosed by the polymer.<br>
The basic compound may be inorganic compounds such as sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, and lithium hydroxide, or<br><br>
organic amines such as diethanolamine, dimethylethanolamine, triethanolamine, diisopropanolainine, for example.<br>
In cases where a surfactant is added as a dispersing aid, the amount of the surfactant is necessary to be as small as possible in a range that the printing quality and water resistance are not impaired.<br>
An acid is added to the resulting dispersion to oxidize the carboxylic acid etc. and to make the polymer water-insoluble, thereby the polymer is deposited on the pigment particle to make adsorb more firmly. In this stage, the pigment particle settles out at the bottom of the aqueous medium in a paste-like condition.<br>
The acid may be inorganic acids or organic acids, for example.' the inorganic acid may be hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, nitric acid, or phosphoric acid, for example; the organic acid may be formic acid or acetic acid, for example. The pll is preferably 2 to (5 after the acid deposition. It is preferred that the amount of the acid is in a range that the acid does not induce property change of the polymer.<br>
Suction filtration, pressure filtration, or centrifugal separation may be employed to neutralize the paste and to separate the paste and water. The neutralized paste is hydrophilized again by adding a basic substance to disperse in an aqueous medium. The basic substance may be the inorganic salts or the organic amines described above.<br>
An emulsion polymerization process may be favorably employed among the interfacial polymerization processes, and the process is carried out within an inert solvent such as deionized water in the presence of a polymerization initiator. The polymerization initiator may<br><br>

After the reaction is completed in the emulsion polymerization process, a polymer emulsion containing an emulsifying agent can be obtained through conventional means such as neutralization.<br>
The content of the dye in the polymer fine particle, which contains the dye and the inorganic fine particle, is preferably 10% to 80% by mass based on the total solid content of the polymer fine particle, more preferably 20% to 60% by mass. When the content is less than 10% by mass, the color saturation and/or image density of ink recorded matters may be insufficient, and when tho content is above 80% by mass,<br><br>
the storage stability of the ink may be impaired. The content of the inorganic pigment particle in the polymer fine particle, which contains the dye and the inorganic fine particle, is preferably 5% to 60% by mass based on the total solid content of the polymer fine particle, more preferably 10% to 40% by mass.<br>
The solid content of the polymer fine particle, which contains the dye and the inorganic fine particle, is preferably 2% to 40% by mass based on the total solid content of the ink composition, more preferably 5% to 20% by mass. Water-Soluble Solvent<br>

sugars, oligosaccharides such as trisaccharidos and tetrasaccharides, and polysaccharides.<br>
Specific examples the saccharide include glucose, mannose, fructose, ribose, xylose, arabinose, galactose, maltose, cellobiosc, lactose, sucrose, trehalose, malt triose, and the like.<br>
The term of the polysaccharides refers to sugars in the broad sense of the term, and includes substances widely found in nature such as alpha-cyclodextrins and celluloses. The sugars encompass derivatives of sugars. The derivatives of sugars are exemplified by reduced sugars, oxidized sugars, amino acids, or thioacids of the sugars.<br>
The reduced sugars are exemplified by sugar alcohols. The sugar alcohols may be the compounds expressed by the formula below. Specific examples of the sugar alcohols include maltitol and sorbit.<br>
HOCH2(CHOII)nCH2OH in the formula above, "n" represents an integer of 2 to 5.<br>
Examples of the oxidized sugars include aldonic acid and uronic acids. Among these, sugar alcohols are preferable.<br>
It is preferred that the content of the water-soluble solvent is 10% to 50% by mass based on the entire amount of the ink composition. When the content, is below 10% by mass, the ejected ink droplets may fly toward non-straight direction or the ink cannot be ejected due to viscosity increase since the ink tends to dry within nozzles, and when the content is above 50% may mass, the storage stability of the ink may be inferior.<br>
The rate of the water-soluble solvent to the solid content of the polymer line particle containing the dye and the inorganic pigment<br><br>
particle (mass of the water soluble solvent/mass of the solid in the polymer fine particle containing the dye and the inorganic pigment particle) considerably affects the stability of the ink ejected from heads. When the content of humectants is low in spite that the solid content of the polymer fine particle containing the dye and the inorganic pigment particle is high, the ink promotes moisture evaporation around the meniscus of nozzles, possibly resulting in defective injection.<br>
The rate of the water-soluble solvent to the solid content of the polymer fine particle containing the dye and the inorganic pigment particle (mass of the water-soluble solvent/mass of the solid in the polymer fine particle containing the dye and the inorganic pigment particle) is preferably 0.25 to 25, more preferably 1 to 8, particularly preferably 2 to 4. When the rate of the water-soluble solvent to the solid content of the polymer line particle containing the dye and the inorganic: pigment particle is within the range, the ink composition may be very superior in drying property, storage property, and reliability. Wetting Agent<br>
When the wetting agent is added to the ink composition, the surface tension is decreased, and the infiltration of the ink droplets applied on recording media such as paper is promoted, consequently, feathering and/or color bleeding can be mitigated.<br>
The wetting agent may be properly selected as long as adapted to adjust the surface tension in a range of 20 to 35 mN/m, and such surfactants may be suited that do not impair dispersibility in combination with the species of dyes and water-soluble solvents.<br><br>

Sumitomo 3M Ltd.), Megafac F-470, F1405, F-474 (by Dainippon Ink And Chemicals, Inc.), Zonyl TBS, FSP, FSA, FSN1OO, FSN, FSO-1OO, FSO, FS-300, UR (by DuPont), FT-110, FT-250, FT-251, FT-400S (by Neos Co.). These may be used alone or in combination of two or more.<br>
Specific examples of the wetting agent are the compounds expressed by the formulas below.<br><br><br><br>

in General Formula (7) above, "p" and "q' each independently represents an integer of 0 to 40."<br><br><br>
in General Formula (8) above, Rf1 represents a group expressed by General Formula (9)1 or (9)2 below.<br><br>
The wetting agent is preferably water-soluble organic solvents such as polyol compounds and glycol ether compounds. It is more preferred, among these, that at least one of polyol compounds having 8 or more carbon atoms and glycol ether compounds is employed.<br>
When the polyol compound has carbon atoms of less than 8, printing quality or image density may be deteriorated since the inGltrating property is insufficient, recording media are soiled, and extending of the ink composition is insufficient on recording media and thus filling of pixels is impaired.<br>
The polyol compounds having 8 or more carbon atoms are preferably 2ethyll,3-hexanediol (solubility: 4.2% at 25°C), 2,2,4-trimethyl-l,3-pentanediol (solubility: 2.0% at 25°C), etc.<br>

monobutyl ether, diethylene glycol monomethyl ether, diethylene glycol monoethyl ether, diethylene glycol monobutyl ether, tetraethylene glycol monomethyl ether, and propylene glycol monoethyl ether; polyhydric alcohol aryl ethers such as ethylene glycol monophenyl ether and ethylene glycol monobenzyl ether.<br>
The content of the wetting agent may be properly selected depending on the application; preferably, the content is 0.1 to 10% by mass based on the total amount of the ink composition, more preferably 1% to 5% by mass. Other Ingredients<br>
The other ingredients are, for example, pH adjuster, antiseptic/antifungal agent, nhelating agent, anticorrosive agent, antikogation agent, water-soluble ultraviolet absorber, water-soluble infrared absorber, etc. pH Adjuster<br>
The pH adjuster stabilizes the dispersed condition to stabilize the ejection by way of maintaining the ink composition at an alkalinity. When the pH of the ink composition is no less than 11, the level to dissolve out InkJet heads or ink-supplying units tends to be significant, thus such problems may occur as deterioration, leakage, or inferior injection of the ink.<br>
It is preferred that the pH adjuster is added at the stage of mixing and dispersing a dye with a dispersant into water rather than adding with a water-soluble solvent, wetting agent, etc. after the stage of mixing and dispersing since the some species of pH adjusters may impair the dispersion.<br><br>
The pH adjuster may be, for example, alcohol amines, alkaline metal hydroxides, ammonium hydroxides, phosphonium hydroxides, and alkaline metal carbonates. These may be used alone or in combination of two or more.<br>
Examples of the alcohol amines include diethanolamine, triethanolamine, 2-amin<r2-ethyl-1 examples of the alkaline metal hydroxides include lithium hydroxide sodium and potassium ammonium quaternary phosphonium carbonates carbonate carbonate. antiseptic agent></r2-ethyl-1>

Examples of the chelating reagents include sodium ethylenediamine tetraacetate, sodium nitrilotriacetate, sodium hydroxyethyl ethylenediamine triacetate, sodium diethylenetriamine pentaacetate, and sodium uramil diacetate. Anticorrosive Agent<br>
Examples of the antirust agents include, acidic sulfite salts, sodium thiosulfate, thiodiglycolic acid ammonium, diisopropylammonium nitrite, pentaerythritol tetranitrate, and dicyclohexylammonium nitrite. Anti-Kogation Agent<br><br>
Kogation can be prevented by way of incorporating the anti kogalion agent into the ink composition.<br>
The kogation is a problem inherent to thermal heads, where an electric current is supplied to a heater to heat instantaneously an ink composition and the ink composition is ejected by action of the pressure caused from the heated ink composition, and refers to such a phenomenon that the ingredients of the ink composition cause a property change upon being heated and the resulting substances adhere on the heater. When the kogation is induced, heating by the heater comes to abnormal, resulting in weaker injection pressure or possibly non-injection of the ink composition in the worst case.<br>
Examples of the anti-kogation agent include polyphosphoric acid, polyamino carboxylic acid, aldonic acid, hydroxycarboxylic acid, polyol phosphate esters, salts of these compounds, acids or salts having ammo group, and ammonium salts having methyl or methylene group and carboxylgroup. Recording Medium<br>
The recording medium comprises a support, a coating layer on at least one side of the support, and other layers as required.<br>
The amount of pure water transferred to the recording medium is no less than 2 ml/m2 and less than 35ml/m2 at a contact period of 100 ms, preferably 2.5 to 15 ml/m2 by measurement of the dynamic scanning absorptometer. When the transferred amount of pure water is below 2 ml/m2 at a contact period of 100 ms, the beading may easily occur, and when above 35 ml/m2, the recorded ink dots may be too small compared to the intended diameter.<br><br>
The amount of pure water transferred to the recording medium is no less than 3 ml/m2 and less than 40 ml/m2 at a contact period of 400 ms by measurement of the dynamic scanning absorptometer, preferably 3.5 to 25 ml/m2 by measurement of the dynamic scanning absorptometer. When the transferred amount of pure water is below 3 ml/m2 at a contact period of 400 ms, spur traces tend to generate due to insufficient drying property, and when above 40 ml/m2, the gloss of image portions may be low after drying.<br>
The dynamic scanning absorptometer (DSA, Japan TAPP1 Journal, vol. 48, May 1994, pp. 88-92, Shigenori Kuga) is an apparatus that can determine the amount of liquid absorbed in a very short period. The dynamic scanning absorptometer automatically measures the absorbed amount in a way that the velocity to absorb a liquid is directly read on the basis of movement of a meniscus within a capillary, the sample is disc-like, a head to absorb the liquid is scanned spirally on the sample, the scanning velocity is automatically changed in accordance with a predetermined pattern, and a necessary number of measurements are repeated per sample. A head to supply the liquid to the paper sample is connected to the capillary through a Teflon® tube, and the site of the meniscus within tho capillary is automatically read by an optical sensor. Specifically, the amount of transferred water was measured using a dynamic scanning absorptometer (K350 series D type, Kyowaseiko Co.). The transferred amounts at contact periods of 100 ms and 400 ms can be determined respectively by way of interpolating the measurements of the transferred amounts at near the contact periods of the intended contact period.<br><br>
Support<br>
The support may bo properly selected depending on the application; examples thereof include papers based on wood fibers, and sheet substances such as nonwoven fabrics based on wood or synthetic fibers.<br>
The paper may be properly selected from conventional ones and may be produced from wood pulp or waste paper pulp. Examples of the wood pulp include broad-leaf kraft pulp (LBKP), needle-leaf kraft pulp (NBKP), LBSB, GP, and TMP.<br>
The raw material of the waste paper pulp may be white shaving paper (johaku), ruled white paper (keihaku), creamy white paper (cream haku), card, special white paper (tokuhaku), medium white paper (chuhaku), flyleaf shaving paper (mozou), fair paper (irohaku), Kent paper, white art paper (shiro art), finest cut paper (tokujogiri), special cut paper (betsujogiri), newspaper, magazine paper, etc., as shown in the standard table for waste paper standard quality (by Waste Paper Regeneration Acceleration Center Foundation). More specifically, the waste papers are chemical pulp papers and high yield pulp-containing papers; examples thereof are printer papers such as non-coated computer papers, heat-sensitive papers, and pressure-sensitive papers; OA waste papers such as PPC papers; coated papers such as art papers, coat papers, slightly coated papers (bitoko papers), and matte papers; non-coated papers such as wood-free papers, color wood-free papers, notebook papers, letter papers, packing papers, fancy papers, wood-containing papers, newspapers, ground-wood papers, super-calendered papers, flyleaf shaving papers. pure white machine<br><br>
glazed papers, and milk cartons. These may be used alone or in combination of two or more.<br>
The waste paper pulp is typically produced by combining four steps below.<br>
(1)	in separating and loosening step, waste paper is treated with<br>
mechanical force and chemicals to loose into fibers, and printing inks are<br>
removed from the fibers;<br>
(2)	in dust removing step, foreign matters such as plastics in the waste<br>
paper are removed by screens, cleaners, etc.;<br>
(3)	in ink step, printing inks separated from fibers using surfactants<br>
are removed away by floatation or cleaning processes;<br>
(4)	in bleaching step, fibers is subjected to oxidizing or reducing action<br>
to enhance the whiteness of the fibers.<br>
When the waste paper is mixed, the mixing ratio of the waste paper is preferably no more than 40% by mass based on the entire solid content of the total pulp. The mixing ratio of no more than 40% by mass may suppress curling of recording media after recording.<br>
The internal filler, used for the support, may be conventional white pigments. Examples of the white pigment include white inorganic pigments such as light calcium carbonate, heavy calcium carbonate, kaolin, clay, talc, calcium sulfate, barium sulfate, titanium dioxide, zinc oxide, zinc sulfide, zinc carbonate, satin white, aluminum silicate, diatomaceous earth, calcium silicate, magnesium silicate, synthetic silica, aluminum hydroxide, alumina, lithopone, zeolite, magnesium carbonate, and magnesium hydroxide; and organic white pigments such as styrene plastic pigment, acrylic plastic pigment, polyethylene microcapsules,<br><br>

The internal sizing agent used for the support in the production is exemplified by neutral rosin sizing agents, alkenyl succinic anhydrides (ASA), alkyl ketene dimmers (AKD), and petroleum resin sizing agents, which are typically used for producing neutral paper; among these, neutral rosin sizing agents and alkenyl succinic anhydrides are preferable. The alkyl ketene dimmers may be used in a smaller amount due to its higher sizing effect, however, may be undesirable from the viewpoint of transportability at inkjet recording since the frictional coefficient tends to be lowered at the surface of recording paper (medium). Coating Layer<br>
The coating layer comprises a pigment, n binder, and optional other ingredients such as surfactant as required.<br>
The pigment may be inorganic pigments, combinations of inorganic pigments and organic pigments, etc.<br>
Examples of the inorganic pigments include kaolin, talc, heavy calcium carbonate, light calcium carbonate, calcium sulfite, amorphous silica, titanium white, magnesium carbonate, titanium dioxide, aluminum hydroxide, calcium hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide, zinc hydroxide, and chlorite.<br>
Among these, kaolin is particularly preferable in view of excellent gloss-generating ability and ability to provide texture similar as that of offset printing paper.<br><br>
Specific examples of the kaolin are delaminated kaolin, calcinated kaolin, engineered kaolin with surface modification, etc.<br>
It is preferred that the content of the kaolin, which having a rate of 80% by mass or more in terms of those having a particle diameter of 2 m or less, is 50% by mass or more based on the total solid amount of the kaolin.<br>
The content of the kaolin is preferably 50 parts by mass or more based on 100 parts by mass of the binder. When the content is below 50 parts by mass, the effect on gloss level may be insufficient.<br>
The upper limit of the content is not defined specifically, preferably, the content is no more than 90 parts by mass in view of flowability of the kaolin and viscosity increase under higher shearing force in particular.<br>
The organic pigment may be water-soluble styreneacrylic copolymer particles, styrene-butadiene copolymer particles, polystyrene particles, polyethylene particles, etc. These may be used alone or in combination of two or more.<br>
The content of the organic pigment is preferably 2 to 20 parts by mass based on 100 parts by mass of total pigment in the coating layer.<br>
The organic pigment may afford such effects as gloss generating ability is excellent and the coating layer is highly voluminal, highly glossy, and excellent in surface-coating property since the specific gravities are relatively low compared to those of inorganic pigments.<br>
When the content of the organic pigment is below 2 parts by mass, these effects may be negligible, and when the content is above 20<br><br>
parts by mass, the flowability of the coating liquid is impaired to bring about lower coating workability and the cost is not economical.<br>
The shape of the organic pigment may be properly selected depending on the application; for example, the shape may be solid, hollow, or donut-like. Among these, the hollow shape with a void ratio of 40% or more is preferable from the view point of well balanced gloss-generating ability, surface-coating ability, and flowability of the coating liquid. The average particle diameter of the organic pigment is preferably 0.2 to 3.0 m also from the view point of well balanced gloss-generating ability, surface-coating ability, and flowability of the coating liquid.<br>

The above substances may be used alone or in combination.<br>
Among these, preferable are polyvinyl alcohol, cation-modified polyvinyl alcohol, acetal-modified polyvinyl alcohol, polyester, polyurethane, and polyester-polyurethane copolymers in view of ink absorbability.<br>

The crosslinking agent may be methylol melamine, methylol urea, methylol hydroxypropylene urea, or isocyanate. The self-crosslinkable copolymer is exemplified by copolymers having a unit of N-methylol acrylamide.<br>
The content of the aqueous polymer is preferably 2 to 100 parts by mass based on 100 parts by mass of the pigment, more preferably 3 to<br><br>
50 parts by mass. The amount of the aqueous polymer is determined such that the amount of water transferred to the recording medium comes into a desirable range.<br>
When the dye in the ink composition is waterdispersible, a cationic organic compound may be formulated into the coating layer depending on the application.<br>
The cationic organic compound may be primary to tertiary amines, monomers, oligomers, or polymers of quaternary ammonium salts that react with sulfonic group, carboxyl group, or amino group of a direct dye or an acid dye in a watersoluble ink to form an insoluble salt; may be used.

These may be used alone or in combination of two or more.<br>
It is preferable among others to use a cationic organic compound with a lower molecular mass in combination with another cationic organic compound with a higher molecular mass. The combination of a cationic organic compound with a lower molecular mass and another cationic organic compound with a higher molecular mass may lead to improve image density and to reduce feathering.<br>
The cationic organic compound with a lower molecular mass is preferably dimethylamine-epichlorohydrin polycondensate or polyallylamine hydrochlorid, and the cationic organic compound with a higher molecular mass is preferably poly (diallyl dimethyl ammonium chloride), for example.<br>
Cation equivalent of the cationic organic compound is preferably 3 to 8 meq/g in accordance with a colloid titration method (by use of potassium sulfate and toluidine blue). The cationic organic compound of this range may lead to a preferable range of dry deposition amount described below.<br>

The coating layer may be added with other optional ingredients as required. The other ingredients may be alumina powder, pH adjuster, antiseptic agent, antioxidant, or other additives.<br>
The method for forming the coating layer may be properly selected depending on the application, i.e. the coating layer may be formed by impregnating or coating the coating liquid on the support.<br>
The process to impregnate or to coat the coating liquid may be properly selected depending on the application; for example, the coating is carried out by various coating devices such as conventional size presses, gate roll size presses, film transfer size presses, blade coaters, rod coaters, air knife coaters, curtain coaters, alternatively, conventional size presses, gate roll size presses, or film transfer size presses, equipped paper machines, are employed to impregnate or coat the coating liquid.<br><br>

As shown FIG. 3, the ink cartridge 7 has a cartridge body 41 that contains an ink absorbent 42 to which an ink of specific color is absorbed. The cartridge body 41 is so formed that an upper cover member 44 is adhered or welded to an upper opening of a case 43, and is a mold which is made of a resin shaped body, for example. The ink absorbent 42 is made of porous body such as urethane foam etc., to which an ink is absorbed after being compressively inserted in the cartridge body 41.<br>
The case 43 of the cartridge body 41 has a base portion which is formed with an ink supply port 45 for feeding the ink to the recording head 6, and the ink supply port 45 has an inner periphery to mating with a seal ring 4G. The upper cover member 44 is provided with an atmospheric opening 47.<br>
A cap member 50 is mounted onto the cartridge body 41 in order to prevent leak of the inside ink that may be caused by a compressive deformation of the case 43 before loading when the ink supply port 45 is blocked at handling the inkjet cartridge for loading or transportation or when a pressure is applied to a wide sidewall during vacuum packing.<br>
As shown in FIG. 2, the atmospheric opening 47 is sealed by sealing to the upper cover member 44 a film-shaped seal member 55 of which the oxygen permeability of 100 ml/m2 or more. The seal member 55 has such a dimension as to seal the atmospheric opening 47 and a plurality of grooves 48 that are formed around the atmospheric opening<br><br>
47. Sealing the atmospheric opening 47 with the seal member 55 having the oxygen permeability of 100 ml/m2 or more may bring about an effect to enhance the degassing level of ink since even when an atmosphere present in a space A (see FIG. 3), which being formed between the ink absorbent 42 and the cartridge body 41, causes air to be dissolved in the ink, the air in the ink can be exhausted via the seal member 55 to a space between the cartridge body 41 and the pack member that is disposed outside the cartridge body 41 having a high degree of vacuum, by way of packing the cartridge 7 under a reduced pressure using a pack member made of an aluminum laminate film and the like that is free from air permeability.<br>
FJG. 4 shows a constitutional example of a record cartridge which is provided with an ink receiver, in which the ink composition of the inventive ink-media set being filled, and a head portion for ejecting the recording liquid. Specifically, the record unit 30 is of a serial type, and the main section is constructed from an inkjet head 6, an ink tank 41 for receiving therein the ink composition fed to the inkjet head 6, and a cover member for sealing the ink tank 41. The inkjet head 6 is provided with a number of nozzles 32 for ejecting the ink composition. The ink composition is directed to a common liquid chamber (not shown) through an ink supply tube (not shown) from an ink tank 41, and is ejected from the nozzle 32 in accordance with electric signals, from a recording apparatus body, inputted from an electrode 31. The recording unit of this type is referred to as so-called thermal or bubble type that can be produced at a lower cost by virtue of its inherent constitution, namely, a<br><br>
constitution suitable for the head that has its driving source of thermal energy.<br>
The ink composition of the inventive ink-media set may exhibit ejection stability and frequency stability even in a small amount, and also superior safeness, thus is very suited since wetting ability to thermal elements is improved in the recording method in the thermal or bubble type.<br>
In the above descriptions, the serial type inkjet recording apparatus is explained; the ink composition according to the present invention is also applicable to inkjet recording apparatuses having so-called a line head, in which nozzles are arranged arbitrarily in such a manner as zigzag where the nozzles are arranged as wide as or wider<br>
than the recording medium by integrating the density equal to or several<br>
fractions of the target image resolution.<br>
The inkjet recording apparatuses are not limited to output<br>
printers for PC or digital cameras, but may be multifunctional<br>
apparatuses including a fax, scanner, telephone, and combination<br>
thereof.<br>
Heater<br>
The recording apparatus according to the present invention may<br>
be equipped with a heating fixing device to promote the fixing of the ink<br>
composition. The heating fixing device will be explained as regards the<br>
construction where a plurality of line-type inkjet heads is disposed and<br>
mounted onto a recording device.<br>
In FIG. 5, the spur 74 is a component in which several metal<br>
members of thin gear-like shape are attached to one shaft with a space<br><br>
therebetween, and rotates in a direction to discharge recording media coincidently with a conveying belt 40. The spur 74 acts to guide recording media on printing and conveying such that the leading edge thereof does not interfere with members like a printer cover and the recording media are discharged smoothly and also to push surely the rear edge of the recording media on printing and conveying discharge by use of the driving force of the spur 74 to discharge them. The existence of the spur 74 may prevent troubles such as paper jamming and erroneous travel, meanwhile spur stain may occur when drying of inks is slow since the spur 74 contacts with and rolls on printing surface of recording media.<br>
The heating fixing device 76 is provided on the downstream side of and relatively approximate to the recording head 70B along the conveyance path, as shown in FIG. 5. In this embodiment,, a halogen heater 84 and a reflective plate 82 made to reflect heat radiation of the halogen heater 84 act as the heating-type ink fixing device 76, for example. Thus, according to the embodiment of the present invention, non-contacting heating of the printing surface of a recording medium (paper Pa) is achieved. That is, since the heating is carried out from the top of the surface of the printing area, volatile ingredients in inks such as water can be dried out efficiently. As the heating-type ink fixing device 76, there are provided the halogen heater 84 as the heating part, the reflective plate 82 reflecting the heat radiation from the halogen heater 84, a heating part separating member 86 separating the halogen heater 84 from the conveyance path, and a heat insulating device 78 thermally<br><br>
isolating the recording head 70B from the halogen heater 84 so as to<br>
avoid the heat of the heater 84 from reaching the recording head 70B.<br>
Ink Recorded Matter<br>
The inventive ink recorded matters are those; recorded by the<br>
inventive inkjet recording apparatuses or the inventive inkjet recording<br>
methods.<br>
The inventive ink recorded matters have an image formed by use<br>
of the ink composition of the ink-media set on the recording medium of<br>
the inventive ink media set.<br>
The recording medium may he properly selected depending on the application and may be similar as the recording media described above. These may be used alone or in combination of two or more.<br>
The inventive ink recorded matter is formed from the ink composition that comprises a polymer line particle containing a dye and an inorganic pigment particle, a water-soluble solvent, and water, and has a surface tension of 20 mN/m to 35 mN/m at 25°C, and the recording medium comprises a support and a coating layer on at least one side of the support, and the amount of pure water transferred to the recording medium is no less than 2 ml/m2 and less than 35 ml/m2 at a contact period of 100 ms and the amount of pure water transferred to the recording medium is no less than 3 ml/m2 and less than 40 ml/m2 at a contact period of 400 ms by measurement of a dynamic scanning absorptometer, therefore, high quality images with higher color saturation and adequate color tone can be obtained even on recording media with low ink absorbability. In addition, there exists an effect to<br><br>
increase color lightness (brightness) or color saturation (freshness) in color printing.<br>
The inventive ink recorded matter can be favorably used in various applications as literatures or written materials on which various printing or images are recorded.<br>

The resulting Ink Compositions 1 to 27 were measured in terms of volume average particle diameter, viscovsily, surface tension, pH, and soluble content. The results are shown in Table 2. (i) Volume Average Particle Diameter<br>
The volume average particle diameter was measured using UPA-EX 150 (by Microtrac Co.) at 25oC after diluting samples to be measured with deionized water to 500 times. (ii) Viscosity<br>
The viscosity was measured using RC-F)00 (by Toki Sangyo Co.) at 25°C. (iii) Surface Tension<br>
The surface tension was measured using Model CBVPZ (by Kyowa Interface Science Co.,) at 25°C. (iv) pH<br>
The pH was measured using pH BOY-P2 (by Shindengen Electric Mfg. Co.) at 25°C. (v) Soluble Content<br>
The rate (%) of soluble color materials relative to color materials in inks can be determined by way of measuring an ink composition and a filtrate of the ink composition in terms of their spectroscopic absorption<br><br>
spectra using a spectropbolometer and comparing their absorbance at the peak wavelength. The filtering process is desirably ultrafiltration in order to separate between dispersion particles and soluble materials.<br>
Biomax PXB050A50 (by Millipore Co.) with a molecular weight cut off of 50,000 (corresponding to a conversion particle diameter of 5 DID) was used as the ultrafiltration device. U-3310 (by Hitachi Co.) was used as the spectrophotometer to measure optical spectra in a wavelength range of 200 to 800 nm.<br>
Specifically, the soluble content is measured and calculated as follows. Initially, absorption spectrum distribution is determined with respect to an ink as an original liquid. The concentration of inks is typically too largo in their original liquids, thus the inks are diluted from 500 to 5,000 times using pure water (dilution ratio Ka is recorded) and the diluted ink is inserted into a measuring cell of the spectrophotomefer. Pure water is filled into a reference cell, and the cell is scanned at a sampling interval of 5 nm or less at least in a visible light range of 340 to 800 nm to take a spectroscopic absorption spectrum of the original liquid shown by the mark ■ in FIG. 7. The original liquid of the ink is treated with ultrafiltration after measuring the spectroscopic absorption spectrum. The filtrate is diluted to a concentration measurable by the spectrophotometer, the dilution ratio Kb is recorded, the diluted filtrate is inserted into a measuring cell of the spectrophotometer and measured under the same condition with that of the original liquid of the ink, thereby to obtain a spectroscopic absorption spectrum of the filtrate shown by the mark Δ in FIG. 7. The values A, B of the absorbance (abs) are obtained at the absorption peak wavelengths of the original liquid<br><br>
and the filtrate, then the soluble content is calculated from the following equation. It is preferred that the maximum peak is selected in cases where two or more peaks exist for the absorbance (abs).<br>
Soluble content (%) = (Kb x B)/(Ka x A) x 100 The soluble content in FIG. 7 can be calculated as follows, for example.<br>
Soluble content (%) = (90 x 2.24)/(2000 x 1.74) x 100 - 5.8%<br><br><br>
