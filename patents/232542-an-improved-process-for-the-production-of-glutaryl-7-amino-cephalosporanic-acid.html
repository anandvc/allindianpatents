				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>This invention relates to an improved process for the production of glutaryl- 7-amino cephalosporanic acid. More particularly it relates to the production of glutaryl-7-amino cephalosporanic acid using D-amino acid oxidase immobilized on crosslinked glycidyl metha-crylate-divinyl  benzene   copolymers.<br>
D-Amino acid oxidase catalyses the conversion of D-amino acids to corresponding alpha-keto acids as described in Applied Biochemistry and Biotechnology, vol.6, p.293, 1981. It is now established that this enzyme can be used in the production of 7-amino cepha¬losporanic acid(7-ACA) via glutaryl-7-amino cephalospo¬ranic  acid(glutaryl-7-ACA).<br>
7-ACA is a key intermediate in the preparation of many cepham antibiotics such as cefazolin, cephalogly-cine and cephalothin. The sequence of chemical reac¬tions that occur during the conversion of cephalosporin C  to   7-ACA  and  the  enzymes   involved  are  as   follows:<br>
Cephalosporin  C<br>
D-Amino  acid  oxidase Keto-adipyl-7-ACA   +   H202   +   NH3<br>
Spontaneous Glutaryl-7-ACA   +   C02   +   H20<br>
Glutaryl   acylase 7-ACA   +  Glutaric   acid<br>
Conversion of cephalosporin C to 7-ACA is per¬formed in two different reactors : the first one con¬tains D-amino acid oxidase which produces glutaryl-7-ACA and second contains glutaryl acylase which hydroly-ses glutaryl-7-ACA to generate 7-ACA. Currently both immobilized whole cells of a microorganism containing D-amino acid oxidcise and immobilized D-amino acid oxidase are used for the production of glutaryl-7-ACA as  described  in  the   following  literature   :<br>
German Patent DE 4 028 119; Japan Kokai Tokkyo Koho JP 79 154 592; Czeck CS 251 457; European Patent Appl. EP 492 495, EP 496 993 and EP 517 200; Annals of New York Academy of Sciences vol. 672, p. 502-509, 1992 and  Bioprocess  Engineering  vol.12,   p.   249-252,   1995.<br>
Of these, processes that use immobilized whole cells containing D-amino acid oxidase suffer from disadvantages such as shorter operational life, lower catalytic efficiency and leaching of the metabolites from the cells whereas the matrices used in the prepa¬ration of immobilized D-amino acid oxidases are not designed to provide ideal microenvironment for the chemical reactions and hence the conversion of cepha¬losporin C to glutaryl-7-ACA is less than 95% in these processes.   The   conversion   of   cephalosporin   C   to   gluta-<br>
ryl-7-ACA is comprised of chemical reactions involving many reactants. Thus, for a commercially efficient process, it is essential that the D-amino acid oxidase is immobilized on a matrix whose structure is tailored so  that   the  chemical   reactions   are  driven  promptly.<br>
In our copending application No. 2937/DEL/97, we have described and claimed a process for the prepara¬tion of crosslinked macroporous glycidyl methacrylate -divinyl benzene copolymers which are designed to have physical and chemical properties desired for the immo¬bilization of D-amino acid oxidase. We have also de¬scribed and claimed a process for the production of immobilized D-amino acid oxidase using the crosslinked macroporous glycidyl methacrylate - divinyl benzene copolymers in our copending Application No. 2946/DEL/97.<br>
It is the object of present invention to provide a process for production of glutaryl-7-ACA using immobi¬lized  D-amino  acid  oxidase.<br>
Yet another object is to provide a process wherein the conversion of cephalosporin C to glutaryl-7-amino cephalosporanic   acid   is  more   than  95%.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides an improved  process   for  the  production  of  glutaryl-7-Amino<br>
cephalosporanic acid, which comprises suspending D-Amino acid oxidase immobilized on crosslinked glycidyl methacrylate-divinyl benzene copolymers in phosphate buffer, adding to this suspension the solution of cephalosporin C, agitating the resultant reaction mixture at rpm between 150 to 250, maintaining a tem¬perature in the range of 20 to 24°C, aerating the reaction mixture, maintaining the pH between 7.6 to 7.8 by conventional method followed by separation of the immobilized D-Amino acid oxidase and recovering the glutaryl-7-amino cephalosporanic acid by conventional methods.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, the molarity of the buffer used may be in the range 0.05 to 0.1.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, the pH of the solution is maintained by controlled addition of alkaline solution, preferably ammonia solution having a strength  of   0.05   to   0.1   M.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the invention, the immobilized D-amino acid oxidase used is prepared as described and claimed in our copending application number   2 94 6/DEL/97.<br>
The D-amino acid oxidase activity is determined by using cephalosporin C as the substrate at 3 7°C and pH 8.0 as described in Biocatalysis and Biotransformation vol. 12, p.215-219, 1995 and in Methods in Enzymology vol.    3,   p.    414-418,    1957.<br>
The process of the present invention is described with reference to the following examples which are illustrative only and should not be construed to   limit   the   scope  of   the   invention  in  any  manner.<br>
