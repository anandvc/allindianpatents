				<td>COMPRESSOR DIAGNOSTIC SYSTEM<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0001] The present invention relates to a diagnostic system for a<br>
compressor. More particularly, the present invention relates to a diagnostic<br>
system for a refrigeration or air-conditioning system which uses the compressors<br>
"trip" information to diagnose the problems associated with the system.<br>
BACKGROUND AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002] A class of machines exists in the art generally known as scroll<br>
machines which are used for the displacement of various types of fluid. These<br>
scroll machines can be configured as an expander, a displacement engine, a<br>
pump, a compressor, etc. and the features of the present invention are<br>
applicable to any of these machines. For purposes of illustration, however, the<br>
disclosed embodiment is in the form of a hermetic refrigerant scroll compressor<br>
used within a refrigeration or air conditioning system.<br>
[0003] Scroll compressors are becoming more and more popular for<br>
use as compressors in both refrigeration as well as air conditioning applications<br>
due primarily to their capability for extremely efficient operation. Generally, these<br>
machines incorporate a pair of intermeshed spiral wraps, one of which is caused<br>
to orbit relative to the other so as to define one or more moving chambers which<br>
progressively decrease in size as they travel from an outer suction port toward a<br>
center discharge port. An electric motor is provided which operates to drive the<br><br>
orbiting scroll member via a suitable drive shaft affixed to the motor rotor. In a<br>
hermetic compressor, the bottom of the hermetic shell normally contains an oil<br>
sump for lubricating and cooling purposes. While the diagnostic system of the<br>
present invention will be described in conjunction with a scroll compressor, it is to<br>
be understood that the diagnostic system of the present invention can be used<br>
with other types of compressors also.<br>
[0004] Traditionally, when an air conditioning or refrigeration system is<br>
not performing as designed, a technician is called to the site for trouble shooting<br>
the problem. The technician performs a series of checks that assists in isolating<br>
the problem with the system. One of the causes of the system's problem could<br>
be the compressor used in the system. A faulty compressor exhibits some<br>
operational patterns that could be used to detect the fact that the compressor is<br>
faulty. Unfortunately, many other causes for system problems can be attributed<br>
to other components in the system and these other causes can also affect the<br>
performance of the compressor and its operational pattern. It is possible to<br>
analyze the system's problems and operational patterns and determine that the<br>
compressor is faulty when in fact the problem lies elsewhere and the compressor<br>
is not the problem. This confusion of causes usually results in the replacement<br>
of a good compressor. This error in diagnosis is costly since the compressor is<br>
generally the most expensive component in the system. Further aggravating the<br>
problem is that the root cause for the system's problem has not solved and the<br>
problem recurs in time. Any tool which can help avoid the misdiagnosing of the<br>
system's problem as described above would prove both useful and cost effective.<br><br>
The present invention discloses a device that increases the accuracy of the<br>
problem diagnosis for an air conditioning or refrigeration system.<br>
[0005] A large part of the compressors used in air conditioning and<br>
refrigeration systems have built-in protection devices called "internal line break<br>
protectors". These protectors are thermally sensitive devices which are wired in<br>
electrical series with the motor. The protectors react thermally to the line current<br>
drawn by the motor and also other temperatures within the compressor including<br>
but not limited to discharge gas temperature, suction gas temperature or<br>
temperature of a particular component in the compressor. When one of these<br>
temperatures exceeds a designed threshold, the protector will open the electrical<br>
connection to the motor. This shuts down the motor operating the compressor<br>
which in turn shuts down the compressor and prevents it from operating in<br>
regions that would lead to its failure. After a period of time, when the<br>
temperatures have fallen to safe levels, the protector automatically resets itself<br>
and the compressor operates again. The temperatures that the protector is<br>
reacting to are a result of the operation of the compressor and the entire system.<br>
Either the operation of the compressor or the operation of the entire system can<br>
influence the temperatures sensed by these protectors. The significant aspect of<br>
the protection system is that some categories of faults repeatedly trip the<br>
protector with very short compressor ON time and other categories of faults trip<br>
the protector less frequently thus providing relatively longer compressor ON<br>
times. For example, a compressor with seized bearings would trip the protector<br>
within about ten seconds of ON time. On the other hand, a system that has a<br><br>
very low refrigerant charge will trip the protector after tens of minutes of ON time.<br>
An analysis of the trip frequency, trip reset times and compressor ON times will<br>
provide valuable clues in identifying the cause of the system's problems.<br>
[0006] The present invention provides a device which is based on this<br>
principle. The device of the present invention continuously records the status of<br>
the protector (open or closed) as a function of time and then it analyzes this<br>
status information to determine a faulty situation. The device goes further and<br>
isolates the fault to either the compressor or to the rest of the system. Once the<br>
fault has been isolated, the device will activate a visual indicator (light) and it will<br>
also send an electrical signal to any intelligent device (controller, computer, etc.)<br>
advising about the situation. The technician, on arriving at the scene, then has a<br>
clear indication that the problem is most likely in the system components other<br>
than the compressor or the problem is most likely in the compressor. He can<br>
then focus his further trouble shooting to the identified area. The device thus<br>
avoids the previously described situation of a confused diagnosis and the<br>
potential of mistakenly replacing a good compressor.<br>
[0007] Further areas of applicability of the present invention will<br>
become apparent from the detailed description provided hereinafter. It should be<br>
understood that the detailed description and specific examples, while indicating<br>
the preferred embodiment of the invention, are intended for Durposes of<br>
illustration only and are not intended to limited the scope of the invention.<br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
[0019] The following description of the preferred embodiment(s) is<br>
merely exemplary in nature and is in no way intended to limit the invention, its<br>
application, or uses.<br>
[0020] Referring now to the drawings in which like reference numerals<br>
designate like or corresponding parts throughout the several views, there is<br>
shown in Figure 1 a scroll compressor incorporating the unique compressor<br>
diagnostic system in accordance with the present invention and which is<br>
designated generally by the reference numeral 10. While compressor 10 is being<br>
illustrated as a scroll compressor in conjunction with a refrigeration or air<br>
conditioning system, it is within the scope of the present invention to utilize other<br>
types of compressors in the refrigeration or air conditioning system if desired as<br>
well as having any of the compressor designs being in conjunction with other<br>
types of systems.<br><br>
[0021] Scroll compressor 10 comprises a generally cylindrical hermetic<br>
shell 12 having welded at the upper end thereof a cap 14 and at the lower end<br>
thereof a base 16 having a plurality of mounting feet (not shown) integrally<br>
formed therewith. Cap 14 is provided with a refrigerant discharge fitting 18 which<br>
may have the usual discharge valve therein. A transversely extending partition<br>
20 is affixed to shell 12 by being welded about is periphery at the same point that<br>
cap 14 is welded to shell 12. A compressor mounting frame 22 is press fit within<br>
shell 12 and it is supported by the end of base 16. Base 16 is slightly smaller in<br>
diameter than shell 12 such that base 16 is received within shell 12 and welded<br>
about its periphery as shown in Figure 1.<br>
[0022] Major elements of compressor 10 that are affixed to frame 22<br>
include a two-piece main bearing housing assembly 24, a lower bearing housing<br>
26 and a motor stator 28. A drive shaft or crankshaft 30 having an eccentric<br>
crank pin 32 at the upper end thereof is rotatably journaled in a bearing 34<br>
secured within main bearing housing assembly 24 and a second bearing 36<br>
secured within lower bearing housing 26. Crankshaft 30 has at the lower end<br>
thereof a relatively large diameter concentric bore 38 which communicates with a<br>
radially outwardly positioned smaller diameter bore 40 extending upwardly<br>
therefrom to the top of crankshaft 30. The lower portion of the interior of shell 12<br>
defines an oil sump 44 which is filled with lubricating oil to a level slightly above<br>
the lower end of a rotor, and bore 38 acts as a pump to pump lubricating fluid up<br>
crankshaft 30 and into bore 40 and ultimately to all of the various portions of<br>
compressor 10 which require lubrication.<br><br>
[0023] Crankshaft 30 is rotatably driven by an electric motor which<br>
includes stator 28, windings 46 passing therethrough and a rotor 48 press fitted<br>
into crankshaft 30. An upper counterweight 50 is secured to crankshaft 30 and a<br>
lower counterweight 52 is secured to rotor 48. A temperature protector 54, of the<br>
usual type, is provided in close proximity to motor windings 46. Thermal<br>
protector 54 will de-energize the motor if thermal protector 54 exceeds its normal<br>
temperature range. Thermal protector 54 can be heated by motor windings 46,<br>
suction gas within a suction chamber 56 and/or discharge gas within a discharge<br>
chamber 58 which is released into suction chamber 56. Both suction chamber<br>
56 and discharge chamber 58 are defined by shell 12, cap 14, base 16 and<br>
partition 22 as shown in Figure 1.<br>
[0024] The upper surface of two-piece main bearing housing assembly<br>
24 is provided with a flat thrust bearing surface on which is disposed an orbiting<br>
scroll member 60 having the usual spiral vane or wrap 62 extending upward from<br>
an end plate 64. Projecting downwardly from the lower surface of end plate 64 of<br>
orbiting scroll member 60 is a cylindrical hub 66 having a journal bearing therein<br>
and which is rotatably disposed a drive bushing 68 having an inner bore in which<br>
crank pin 32 is drivingly disposed. Crank pin 32 has a flat on one surface which<br>
drivingly engages a flat surface formed in a portion of the inner bore of drive<br>
bushing 68 to provide a radially compliant driving arrangement, such as shown in<br>
Assignee's U.S. Letters Patent 4.877.382, the disclosure of which is hereby<br>
incorporated herein by reference. An Oldham coupling 70 is also provided<br>
positioned between orbiting scroll member 60 and two-piece bearing housing<br><br>
assembly 24. Oldham coupling 70 is keyed to orbiting scroll member 60 and to a<br>
non-orbiting scroll member 72 to prevent rotational movement of orbiting scroll<br>
member 60.<br>
[0025] Non-orbiting scroll member 72 is also provided with a wrap 74<br>
extending downwardly from an end plate 76 which is positioned in meshing<br>
engagement with wrap 62 of orbiting scroll member 60. Non-orbiting scroll<br>
member 72 has a centrally disposed discharge passage 78 which communicates<br>
with an upwardly open recess 80 which is in turn in communication with<br>
discharge chamber 58. An annular recess 82 is also formed in non-orbiting scroll<br>
member 72 within which is disposed a floating seal assembly 84.<br>
[0026] Recesses 80 and 82 and floating seal assembly 84 cooperate to<br>
define axial pressure biasing chambers which receive pressurized fluid being<br>
compressed by wraps 62 and 74 so as to exert an axial biasing force on non-<br>
orbiting scroll member 72 to thereby urge the tips of respective wraps 62 and 74<br>
into sealing engagement with the opposed end surfaces of end plates 76 and 64,<br>
respectively. Floating seal assembly is preferably of the type described in<br>
greater detail in Assignee's U.S. Letters Patent 5,156,639, the disclosure of<br>
which is hereby incorporated herein by reference. Non-orbiting scroll member 72<br>
is designed to be mounted for limited axial movement with respect to two-piece<br>
main bearing housing assembly 24 in a suitable manner such as disclosed in the<br>
aforementioned U.S. Letters Patent 4,877,382 or Assignee's U.S. Letters Patent<br>
5,102,316, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference.<br><br>
[0027] Compressor 10 is powered by electricity which is provided to the<br>
electric motor within shell 12 through a molded electric plug 90.<br>
[0028] Referring now to Figures 1 through 3, the present invention is<br>
directed to a unique compressor diagnostic system 100. Diagnostic system 100<br>
comprises one or more current sensing devices 102 and the associated logic<br>
circuitry 104. Current sensing devices 102 are mounted in a housing 106<br>
mounted externally to shell 12. Logic circuitry 104 can be mounted in housing<br>
106 or it can be located in a convenient position with respect to compressor 10<br>
as shown in phantom in Figure 2. Optionally, the sensing device and circuitry<br>
can be integrated into a special contactor, a special wiring harness or into a<br>
molded plug utilized for some compressor designs.<br>
[0029] Current sensing devices 102 sense the current in the power<br>
supply wires powering compressor 10. Figure 2 illustrates two current sensing<br>
devices 102 in conjunction with a single-phase motor. One of the current<br>
sensing devices 102 is associated with the main windings for the compressor<br>
motor and the other current sensing device 102 is associated with the auxiliary<br>
windings for the compressor motor. Figure 3 also illustrates two current sensing<br>
devices 102 in conjunction with a three phase motor. Each current sensing<br>
device 102 is associated with one of the phases of the three phase power supply.<br>
While Figure 3 illustrates two current sensing devices sensing current in two<br>
phases of the three phase power supply, it is within the scope of the present<br>
invention to include a third current sensor 102 to sense the current in the third<br>
phase of the three phase power supply as shown in phantom in Figure 3 if<br><br>
desired. These current signals represent an indication of the status of protector<br>
54 (open or closed). While current sensing devices 102 sense the status of<br>
protector 54 utilizing the current in the power supply wires, it is also possible to<br>
sense the status of protector 54 by sensing the presence or absence of voltage<br>
on the motor side of protector 54. The inventors of the present invention<br>
consider this to be a less desirable but effective approach in some cases<br>
because it requires an additional hermetic feed-through pin extending through<br>
shell 12. The signals received from current sensing devices 102 are combined in<br>
logic circuitry 104 with the demand signal for compressor 10. The demand signal<br>
for compressor 10 is acquired by sensing the presence of supply voltage or by<br>
having a system controller (not shown) supply a discrete signal representing the<br>
demand. The demand signal and the signal received by logic circuitry 104 are<br>
processed by logic circuitry 104 to derive the information about the trip frequency<br>
of protector 54 and the average ON time and OFF time of compressor 10. Logic<br>
circuitry 104 analyses the combination of current signals, the demand signal and<br>
the derived protector trip frequencies to determine if a fault condition exists.<br>
Logic circuitry also has the unique capability of identifying a specific cause based<br>
on some faults. This information is provided to the service people using a green<br>
LED light 110 and a yellow LED light 112. Green LED light 110 is utilized to<br>
indicate that there is currently no fault condition and that the system is<br>
functioning normally.<br>
[0030] Yellow LED light 112 is utilized to indicate the presence of a<br>
fault. When yellow LED light 112 is turned ON, green LED light 110 is turned<br><br>
OFF. Thus, yellow LED light 112 is utilized to visually communicate that there is<br>
a fault as well as indicating the type of fault that is present. This communication<br>
is accomplished by turning yellow LED light 112 ON and then OFF for a specific<br>
duration and sequence to indicate both that there is a fault and to identify what<br>
the fault is. For example, turning light 112 ON for one second and turning it OFF<br>
for nineteen seconds and repeating this sequence every twenty seconds will<br>
create the effect of a blinking light that blinks ON once every twenty seconds.<br>
This sequence corresponds to a type of fault that is coded as a type 1 fault. If<br>
light 112 is blinked ON twice for one second during the twenty second window, it<br>
is an indication that a fault that is coded as a type 2 is present. This sequence<br>
continues to indicate a type 3, a type 4 and so on with the type of fault being<br>
indicated by the number of blinks of light 112. This scheme of the blinking of light<br>
112 for a specific number of times is employed to visually communicate to the<br>
technician the various types of faults detected by logic circuitry 104. While the<br>
present invention utilizes blinking light 112 to convey the fault codes, it is within<br>
the scope of the present invention to utilize a plurality of lights to increase the<br>
effectiveness of conveying a large number of fault codes if desired. In addition,<br>
other methods of providing the default code, including providing a coded voltage<br>
output that can be interfaced with a Digital Volt Meter, can also be employed.<br>
[0031] In addition to visually communicating the specific fault code<br>
using light 112, logic circuitry 104 also outputs a coded sequence of electrical<br>
pulses to other intelligent controllers that may exist in the system. These coded<br>
pulses represent the type of fault that has been detected by diagnostic system<br><br>
100. The types of faults which can be detected by logic circuitry 104 include, but<br>
are not limited to:<br>
1.	Protector has "tripped".<br>
2.	The auxiliary winding of a single phase motor has no power or is<br>
open or has a faulty run capacitor.<br>
3.	The main winding of a single phase motor has no power or that the<br>
winding is open.<br>
4.	The main circuit breaker has contacts that have welded shut.<br>
5.	One of the phases in a 3 phase circuit is missing.<br>
6.	The phase sequence in a 3 phase system is reversed.<br>
7.	The supply voltage is very low.<br>
8.	The rotor inside the compressor has seized.<br>
9.	The protector is tripping due to system refrigeration circuit<br>
problems.<br>
10.	The motor windings are open or the internal line break protector is<br>
faulty.<br>
[0032] As a variation to the above, as shown in Figure 3, diagnostic<br>
system 100 may only send the status of protector 54 to an intelligent device 116.<br>
In this option, the parameters of trip frequencies, ON times and OFF times with<br>
the diagnosis information may be generated at intelligent device 116. Intelligent<br>
device 116 can be a compressor controller associated with compressor 10, it can<br>
be a system controller monitoring a plurality of compressors 10, it can be a<br>
remotely located device or it can be any other device which is selected to monitor<br>
diagnostic system 100 of one or more compressors.<br>
[0033] Figure 4 represents a flow diagram for diagnostic system 100 in<br>
conjunction with a single phase compressor. The demand signal is provided to<br>
logic circuitry 104 from a device or a contactor 120 (Figures 2 and 3) along with<br><br>
the current signal from sensing devices 102. When the system is initially<br>
powered up, an initializing process is performed at 122 and, if successful, the<br>
system, as shown by arrow 124, goes to a normal OFF condition as shown at<br>
126. When sitting at the normal OFF condition 126, if a demand signal is<br>
provided to the system, the system moves as shown by arrow 128 to a normal<br>
run condition shown at 130. Once the demand has been met, the system returns<br>
to the normal OFF condition 126 as shown by arrow 132.<br>
[0034] While sitting at the normal OFF condition 126, if current in the<br>
main winding or current in the auxiliary winding is detected and there has been<br>
no demand signal, the system moves as shown by arrow 134 to a shorted<br>
contactor condition 136. While indicating the shortened contactor condition 136,<br>
if the demand is signaled, the system moves as shown by arrow 138 to the<br>
normal run condition 130. The normal run condition 130 continues until the<br>
demand has been satisfied where the system moves as shown by arrow 132<br>
back to the normal OFF condition 126 which may again move to the shortened<br>
contactor condition 136 depending on whether or not current is sensed in the<br>
main or auxiliary windings.<br>
[0035] While operating in the normal run condition 130, one of three<br>
paths other than returning to the normal OFF condition 126 can be followed.<br>
First, if the system senses demand and main winding current but does not sense<br>
auxiliary winding current, the system moves as shown by arrow 140 to an open<br>
auxiliary circuit condition 142. From here, the system moves to a protector<br>
tripped condition 144 as shown by arrow 146 when both a main winding current<br><br>
and an auxiliary winding current are not sensed. Second, if the system senses<br>
demand and auxiliary winding current but does not sense main winding current,<br>
the system moves as shown by arrow 148 to an open main circuit condition 150.<br>
From here, the system moves to the protector tripped condition 144 as shown by<br>
arrow 152 when both a main winding current and an auxiliary winding current are<br>
not sensed. Third, if the system senses demand and does not sense auxiliary<br>
winding current and main winding current, the system moves as shown by arrow<br>
154 to the protector tripped condition 144.<br>
[0036] While operating in the protector tripped condition 144, one of<br>
four paths can be followed. First, if main winding current or auxiliary winding<br>
current is sensed and the demand is satisfied, the system moves as shown by<br>
arrow 160 to the normal run condition 130. Second, with the protector tripped,<br>
and the moving window average of the ON time of the system has been less than<br>
twelve seconds, the system moves as shown by arrow 162 to a multiple short run<br>
condition 164. From the multiple short run condition, the system moves back to<br>
the protector tripped condition 144 as shown by arrow 166. Third, with the<br>
protector tripped, and the moving window average of the ON time of the system<br>
has been greater than fifteen minutes, the system moves as shown by arrow 168<br>
to a multiple long run condition 170. The system moves back to the protector<br>
tripped condition 144 as shown by arrow 172. Fourth, with the protector tripped,<br>
if the tripped time exceeds four hours, the system moves as shown by arrow 174<br>
to a power loss or protector defective condition 176. If, while the system is in the<br>
power loss or protector defective condition 176 and main winding current or<br><br>
auxiliary winding current is sensed, the system moves back to the protector<br>
tripped condition 144 as shown by arrow 178.<br>
[0037] When the system moves to the various positions shown in<br>
Figure 4, the blinking of light 112 is dictated by the fault condition sensed. In the<br>
preferred embodiment, if a protector tripped condition is sensed at 154 because<br>
demand is present but current is missing, light 112 blinks once. If compressor 10<br>
is seized or there is a low supply voltage problem such as indicated by arrow 162<br>
because the average ON time during the last five trips was less than twelve<br>
seconds, light 112 blinks twice. If the motor windings are open, the protector is<br>
faulty or the contactor is faulty as indicated by arrow 174 because the OFF time<br>
is greater than four hours, light 112 blinks three times. If the auxiliary windings<br>
are open or there is a faulty run capacitor as indicated by arrow 140, light 112<br>
blinks four times. If the main winding is open as indicated by arrow 148, light 112<br>
blinks five times. If the contactor is welded as indicated by arrow 134 because<br>
current is sensed but there is no demand, light 112 blinks six times. Finally, if<br>
there are repeated protector trips due to other system problems as indicated by<br>
arrow 168 because the average ON time during the last five trips was less than<br>
fifteen minutes, light 112 blinks seven times.<br>
[0038] Figure 5 represents a flow diagram for diagnostic system 100 in<br>
conjunction with a three phase compressor. The demand signal is provided to<br>
logic circuitry 104 from contactor 120 (Figures 2 and 3) along with the current<br>
signal from sensing devices 102. When the system is initially powered up, an<br>
initializing process is performed at 122 and, if successful, the system, as shown<br><br>
by arrow 124, goes to a normal OFF condition as shown at 126. When sitting at<br>
the normal OFF condition 126, if a demand signal is provided to the system, the<br>
system moves as shown by arrow 128 to a normal run condition shown at 130.<br>
Once the demand has been met, the system returns to the normal OFF condition<br>
126 as shown by arrow 132.<br>
[0039] While sitting at the normal OFF condition 126, if current in one<br>
of the three phases or current in a second of the three phases is detected and<br>
there has been no demand signal the system moves as shown by arrow 234 to a<br>
shorted contactor condition 136. While indicating the shortened contactor<br>
condition 136, if the demand is signaled, the system moves as shown by arrow<br>
238 to the normal run condition 130. The normal run condition 130 continues<br>
until the demand has been satisfied where the system moves as shown by arrow<br>
132 back to the normal OFF condition 126 which may again move to the<br>
shortened contactor condition 136 depending on whether or not current is sensed<br>
in the main or auxiliary windings.<br>
[0040] While operating in the normal run condition 130, one of three<br>
paths other than returning to the normal OFF condition 126 can be followed.<br>
First, if the system senses demand and eleven milliseconds is less than the zero<br>
crossing time difference between the first and second phases of the three phase<br>
power supply or this time difference is less than fourteen milliseconds, the<br>
system moves as shown by arrow 240 to a phase sequence reversed condition<br>
242. From here, the system moves to a protector tripped condition 144 as shown<br>
by arrow 246 when both a first phase current or a second phase current is not<br><br>
sensed. Second, if the system senses demand and sixteen milliseconds is less<br>
than the zero crossing time difference between the first and second phases or<br>
this time difference is less than twenty-one milliseconds, the system moves as<br>
shown by arrow 248 to a phase missing condition 250. From here, the system<br>
moves to the protector tripped condition 144 as shown by arrow 252 when both a<br>
first phase current and a second phase current are not sensed. Third, if the<br>
system senses demand and does not sense first phase current and second<br>
phase current, the system moves as shown by arrow 254 to the protector tripped<br>
condition 144.<br>
[0041] While operating in the protector tripped condition 144, one of<br>
four paths can be followed. First, if first phase current or second phase current is<br>
sensed and the demand is satisfied, the system moves as shown by arrow 260 to<br>
the normal run condition 130. Second, with the protector tripped, and the moving<br>
window average of the ON time of the system has been less than twelve<br>
seconds, the system moves as shown by arrow 162 to a multiple short run<br>
condition 164. From the multiple short run condition, the system moves back to<br>
the protector tripped condition 144 as shown by arrow 166. Third, with the<br>
protector tripped, and the moving window average of the ON time of the system<br>
has been greater than fifteen minutes, the system moves as shown by arrow 168<br>
to a multiple long run condition 170. The system moves back to the protector<br>
tripped condition 144 as shown by arrow 172. Fourth, with the protector tripped,<br>
if the tripped time exceeds four hours, the system moves as shown by arrow 174<br>
to a power loss or protector defective condition 176. If, while the system is in the<br><br>
power loss or protector defective condition 176 and first phase current or second<br>
phase current is sensed, the system moves back to the protector tripped<br>
condition 144 as shown by arrow 278.<br>
[0042] When the system moves to the various positions shown in<br>
Figure 5, the blinking of light 112 is dictated by the fault condition sensed. In the<br>
preferred embodiment, if a protector tripped condition is sensed at 254 because<br>
demand is present but current is missing, light 112 blinks once. If compressor 10<br>
is seized or there is a low supply voltage problem such as indicated by arrow 162<br>
because the average ON time during the last five trips was less than twelve<br>
seconds, light 112 blinks twice. If the motor windings are open, the protector is<br>
faulty or the contactor is faulty as indicated by arrow 174 because the OFF time<br>
is greater than four hours, light 112 blinks three times. If the contactor is welded<br>
as indicated by arrow 234 because current is sensed but there is no demand,<br>
light 112 blinks four times. If there are repeated protector trips due to other<br>
system problems as indicated by arrow 168 because the average ON time during<br>
the last five trips was less than fifteen minutes, light 112 blinks five times. If the<br>
power supply phases are reversed as indicated by arrow 240 because the zero<br>
crossing time difference is between eleven and fourteen milliseconds, light 112<br>
blinks six times. Finally, if there is a phase missing in the three phase power<br>
supply as indicated by arrow 248 because the zero crossing time difference is<br>
between sixteen and twenty-one milliseconds, light 112 blinks seven times.<br>
[0043] While the above technique has been described as monitoring<br>
the moving window averages for compressor 10, it is within the scope of the<br><br>
present invention to have logic circuitry 104 utilize a real time or the<br>
instantaneous conditions for compressor 10. For instance, in looking at arrows<br>
162 or 168, rather than looking at the moving window average, logic circuitry 104<br>
could look at the previous run time for compressor 10.<br>
[0044] Figure 6 represents a flow diagram which is followed when<br>
diagnosing a system problem. At step 300, the technician determines if there is<br>
a problem by checking the LEDs at step 302. If green LED 110 is lit, the<br>
indication at 304 is that compressor 10 is functioning normally and the problem is :<br>
with other components. If yellow LED light 112 is blinking, the technician counts<br>
the number of blinks at 306. Based upon the number of blinks of light 112 the<br>
determination of the failure type is made at 308. The fault is corrected and the<br>
system is recycled and started at 310. The system returns to step 300 which<br>
again will indicate any faults with compressor 10.<br>
[0045] Thus, diagnostic system 100 provides the technician who<br>
arrives at the scene with a clear indication of most likely where the problem with<br>
the system is present. The technician can then direct his attention to the most<br>
likely cause of the problem and possibly avoid the replacement of a good<br>
compressor.<br>
[0046] Figure 7 illustrates a typical refrigeration system 320.<br>
Refrigeration system 320 includes compressor 10 in communication with a<br>
condensor 322 which is in communication with an expansion device 324 which is<br>
in communication with an evaporator 326 which is in communication with<br><br>
compressor 10. Refrigerant tubing 328 connects the various components as<br>
shown in Figure 7.<br>
[0047] Referring now to Figure 8, a contactor 120 is illustrated which<br>
incorporates diagnostic system 100 in the form of current sensors 102, logic<br>
circuitry 104, green LED light 110 and yellow light 112. Contactor 120.is<br>
designed to receive information from various system controls such as a system<br>
thermostat 350 (Figures 2 and 3), a group of system safeties 352 (Figures 2 and<br>
3) and/or other sensors incorporated into the system and based upon three<br>
inputs provide power to compressor 10.<br>
[0048] Contactor 120 includes a set of power-in connectors 354, a set<br>
of power-out connectors 356, a set of contactor coil connectors 358, light 110<br>
and light 112. The internal schematic for contactor 120 is shown in Figure 9. A<br>
power supply 360 receives power from connectors 354, converts the input power<br>
as needed and then supplies the required power to input circuitry 362,<br>
processing circuitry 364 and output circuitry 366, which collectively form logic<br>
circuitry 104.<br>
[0049] Input circuitry 362 receives the input from current sensors 102<br>
and the demand signal in order to diagnose the health of compressor 10. The<br>
information received by input circuitry 362 is directed to processing circuitry 364<br>
which analyses the information provided and then provides information to output<br>
circuitry 366 to operate compressor 10 and/or activate LED lights 110 and 112.<br>
The incorporation of logic circuitry 104 into contactor 120 simplifies the system<br>
due to the fact that both the line power and the demand signal are already<br><br>
provided to contactor 120. The function and operation of diagnostic system 100<br>
incorporated into contactor 120 is the same as described above for housing 106.<br>
[0050] Referring now to Figure 10, molded plug 90 is illustrated<br>
incorporating diagnostic system 100 in the form of current sensors 102, logic<br>
circuitry 104, light 110 and light 112. In some applications, incorporation of<br>
diagnostic system 100 into molded plug 90 offers some distinct advantages.<br>
When diagnostic system 100 is incorporated into molded plug 90, power is<br>
provided through connectors 354 and must also be provided to diagnostic system<br>
from the input power or it can be provided separately through connector 370. In<br>
addition, the demand signal must also be provided to plug 90 and this can be<br>
done through connectors 372. The function and operation of diagnostic system<br>
100 incorporated into molded plug 90 is the same as described above for<br>
housing 106. Communication from plug 90 is accomplished through connection<br>
374.<br>
[0051] The description of the invention is merely exemplary in nature<br>
and, thus, variations that do not depart from the gist of the invention are intended<br>
to be within the scope of the invention. Such variations are not to be regarded as<br>
a departure from the spirit and scope of the invention.<br><br>
