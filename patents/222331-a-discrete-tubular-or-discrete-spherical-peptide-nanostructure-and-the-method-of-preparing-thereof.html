PEPTIDE NANOSTRUCTURES AND METHODS OF GENERATING AND USING<br>
THE SAME<br>
FIELD AND BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to peptide nanostructiires and methods of generating and using same.<br>
Nanoscience is the science of small particles of materials and is one of the most important research frontiers in modern teclinology. These small particles are of interest from a fundamental point of view since they enable construction of materials and structures of well-defined properties. With the ability to precisely control material properties come new opportunities for technological and commercial development, and applications of nanoparticles have been shown or proposed in areas as diverse as micro- and nanoelectronics, nanofluidics. coatings and paints and biotechnology.<br>
Numerous configurations have been proposed and applied for the construction of nanostructiires. Most widely used are the fullerene carbon nanotubes. Two major forms of carbon nanotubes exist, singie-walled nanotubes (SWNT), which can be considered as long wrapped graphene sheets and multi walled nanotubes (MWNT) which can be considered as a collection of concentric SWNTs with different diameters.<br>
SWNTs have a typical length to diameter ratio of about 1000 and as such are typically considered nearly one-dimensional. These nanotubes consist of two separate regions with different physical and chemical properties. A first such region is the side wall of the tube and a second region is the end cap of the tube. The end cap structure is similar to a derived from smaller fullerene, such as Cgo-<br>
Carbon nanotubes produced to date suffer from major structural limitations. Structural deviations including Y branches, T branches or SWNT junctions, are frequent results of currently used synthesis processes. Though such deviations in structure can be introduced in a "controlled" manner under specific conditions, frequent uncontrollable insertion of such defects result in spatial structures with unpredictable electronic, molecular and structural properties.<br>
Other well-studied nanostructures are lipid surfactant nanomaterials (e.g., diacetylene lipids) which self-assemble into well-ordered nanotubes and other bilayer assemblies in water and aqueous solution [Yager (1984) Mol. Cryst. Liq. Cryst. 106:371-381; Schnur (1993) Science 262:1669-1676; Selinger (2001) J. Phys. Chem.<br><br>
B 105:7157-7169]. One proposed application of lipid tubules is as vehicles for controlled drug release. Accordingly, such tubes coated with metallic copper and loaded with antibiotics were used to prevent marine fouling.<br>
Although lipid-based nanotubules are simple in form, lipid structures are mechanically weak and difficult to modify and functionalize, thus restricting their range of applications.<br>
Recently, peptide building blocks have been shown to form nanotubes. Peptide-based nanotubular structures have been made through stacking of cyclic D-, L- peptide subunits. These peptides self-assemble through hydrogen-bonding interactions into nanotubules, which in-turn self-assemble into ordered parallel arrays of nanotubes. The number of amino acids in the ring determines the inside diameter of the nanotubes obtained. Such nanotubes have been shown to form transmembrane channels capable of transporting ions and small molecules [Ghadiri, M.R. et al., ' Nature 366, 324-327 (1993); Ghadiri, M.R. et al., Nature 369, 301-304 (1994); Bong, D.T. et al., Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 40, 988-1011 (2001)].<br>
More recently, the discovery of surfactant-like peptides that undergo spontaneous assembly to form nanotubes with a helical twist has been made. The monomers of these surfactant peptides, like lipids, have distinctive polar and nonpolar portions. They are composed of 7-8 residues, approximately 2 nm in length when fully extended, and dimensionally similar to phospholipids found in cell membranes. Although the sequences of these peptides are diverse, they share a common chemical property, i.e., a hydrophobic tail and a hydrophilic head. These peptide nanotubes, like carbon and lipid nanotubes, also have a very high surface area to weight ratio. Molecular modeling of the peptide nanotubes suggests a possible structural organization [Vauthey (2002) Proc. Natl. Acad Sci. USA 99:5355; Zhang (2002) Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 6:865], Based on observation and calculation, it is proposed that the cylindrical subunits are formed from surfactant peptides that self-assemble into bilayers, where hydrophilic head groups remain exposed to the aqueous medium. Finally, the tubular arrays undergo self- assembly through non-covalent interactions that are widely found in surfactant and micelle structures and formation processes.<br>
Peptide based bis(N-a-amido-glycyglycine)-1,7-heptane dicarboxylate molecules were also shown to be assembled into tubular structures [Matsui (2000) J. Phys.Chem.B 104:3383].<br><br>
When the crystal structure of di-phenylalanine peptides was determined, it was noted that hollow nanometric channels are formed within the framework of the macroscopic crystal [Gorbitz (2001) Chemistry 7(23):5153-9]. However, no individual nanotubes could be formed by crystallization, as the crystallization conditions used in this study included evaporation of an aqueous solution at 80 °C. No formation of discrete nano-structures was reported under these conditions.<br>
As mentioned hereinabove, peptide nanotubes contributed to a significant progress in the field of nanotechnology since such building blocks can be easily-modified and used in numerous mechanical, electrical, chemical, optical and biotechnological systems.<br>
The development of systems which include nanoscale components has been slowed by the unavailability of devices for sensing, measuring and analyzing with nanometer resolution. One class of devices that have found some use in nanotechnology applications are proximity probes of various types including those used in scanning tunneling microscopes, atomic force microscopes and magnetic force microscopes. While good progress has been made in controlling the position of the macroscopic probe to sub-angstrom accuracy and in designing sensitive detection schemes, the tip designs to date have a number of problems.<br>
One such problem arises from changes in the properties of the tip as atoms move about on the tip, or as the tip acquires an atom or molecule from the object being imaged. Another difficulty with existing probe microscope tips is that they typically are pyramidal in shape, and that they are not able to penetrate small openings on the object being imaged. Moreover, existing probe microscopes often give false image information around sharp vertical discontinuities (e.g., steps) in the object being imaged, because the active portion of the tip may shift from the bottom atom to an atom on the tip's side.<br>
An additional area in which nanoscience can play a role is related to heat transfer. Despite considerable previous research and development focusing on industrial heat transfer requirements, major improvements in cooling capabilities have been held back because of a fundamental limit in the heat transfer properties of conventional fluids. It is well known that materials in solid form have orders-of-magnitude  larger thermal conductivities than those of fluids.     Therefore, fluids<br><br>
containing suspended solid particles are expected to display significantly enhanced thermal conductivities relative to conventional heat transfer fluids.<br>
Low thermal conductivity is a primary limitation in the development of energy-efficient heat transfer fluids required in many industrial applications. To overcome this limitation, a new class of heat transfer fluids called nanofluids has been developed by suspending nanocrystalline particles in liquids such as water, oil, or ethylene glycol. The resulting nanofluids possess extremely high thermal, conductivities compared to the liquids without dispersed nanocrystalline particles. Excellent suspension properties are also observed, with no significant settling of nanocrystalline oxide particles occurring in stationary fluids over time periods longer than several days. Direct evaporation of copper nanoparticles into pump oil results in similar improvements in thermal conductiyity compared to oxide-in-water systems, but importantly, requires far smaller concentrations of dispersed nanocrystalline powder.<br>
Numerous theoretical and experimental studies of the effective thermal conductivity of dispersions containing particles have been conducted since Maxwell's theoretical work was published more than 100 years ago. However, all previous studies of the thermal conductivity of suspensions have been confined to those containing millimeter- or micron-sized particles. Maxwell's model shows that the effective thermal conductivity of suspensions containing spherical particles increases with the volume fraction of the solid particles. It is also known that the thermal conductivity of suspensions increases with the ratio of the surface area to volume of the particle. Since the surface area to volume ratio is 1000 times larger for particles with a 10 nm diameter than for particles with a 10 mm diameter, a much more dramatic improvement in effective thermal conductivity is expected as a result of decreasing the particle size in a solution than can obtained by altering the particle shapes of large particles.<br>
It is recognized that peptide nanotubes are natural candidates for performing the above and many other tasks in the field of nanotechnology.<br>
However, currently available peptide nanotubes are composed of peptide building blocks, which are relatively long and as such are expensive and difficult to produce, or limited by heterogeneity of structures that are formed as bundles or networks rather than discrete nanoscale structures.<br><br>
There is thus a widely recognized need for, and it would be highly advantageous to have, a peptide nanostaicture, which is devoid of the abo^e limitations.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
The present invention is of a peptide nanostructures and methods of generating same, which can be used in numerous applications. Specifically, the present invention can be used in numerous applications, such as, but not limited to, transistors, field emitters, display devices, memory chips, cooling systems and nano-mechanical devices.<br>
-    The principles and operation of the present invention may be better understood with reference to the drawings and accompanying descriptions.<br>
Before explaining at least one embodiment of the invention in detail, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited in its application to the details set forth in the following description or exemplified by the Examples. The invention is capable of other embodiments or of being practiced or carried out in various ways. Also, it is to be understood that the phraseology and terminology employed herein is for the purpose of description and should not be regarded as limiting.<br>
Self-assembled nanostructures allow controlled fabrication of novel nanoscopic materials and devices. Nanotubular structures are particularly important structural elements as they may serve in numerous applications, for example, as nanowires and nanoscaffolds. Most widely used nanotubes are made of carbon or peptide assemblers (i.e., building blocks). While carbon nanotubes, suffer from major structural defects including branching and bending resulting in spatial structures with unpredictable electronic, molecular and structural properties, peptide nanotubes such as those composed of surfactant like peptides and cyclic D-, L-peptide subunits are formed either as crystals, networks, or bundles of nanostructures.<br>
While reducing the present invention to practice, the present inventor uncovered that aromatic peptides (e.g., diphenylalanine) are capable of forming tubular and spherical nanostructures, which can be used in numerous mechanical, electrical, chemical, optical and biotechnological systems.<br>
It will be appreciated that the term nanotubes was previously attributed to the hollow nanometric channels, which, are formed within the macroscopic crystal structure of diphenylalanine peptides. However, these entities are not the individual nanostructures formed by the present invention, but rather are macrioscopic bundles, which cannot be used as nanotubes [Gorbitz (2001) Chemistry 38:6791].<br><br>
This discrepancy in results can be explained by the different conditions which were used to assemble the structures While Gorbitz allowed crystallization by evaporation of an aqueous peptide solution in high temperature (i.e., 80 °C), the present inventor allowed self-assembly in an aqueous solution under mild-conditions (see Example 1 of the Examples sect:::: which follows).<br>
Thus, according to one aspeci of the present invention, there is provided a tubular or spherical nanostructure. The nanostructure of this aspect of the present invention is composed of a plurality of peptides, each peptide including no more than 4 amino acids of which at least one is an aromatic amino acid.<br>
As used herein the phrase "fibular or spherical nanostructure" refers to a spherical or elongated tubular or conic; il structure having a diameter or a cross-section of less than 1 jim (preferably less than 500 nm, more preferably less than about 50 nm, even more preferably less than about 5 nm). The length of the tubular nanostructure of the present invention is preferably at least 1 urn, more preferably at least 10 nm, even more preferably at least 100 nm and even more preferably at least 500 nm. It will be appreciated, though, that the tubular structure of the present invention can be of infinite length (i.e., macroscopic fibrous structures) and as such can be used in the fabrication of hyper-strong materials.<br>
The nanostructure of the present invention is preferably hollow, conductive or semi-conductive.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of this aspect of the present invention the<br>
peptide is a dipeptide or a tripeptide such as set forth in SEQ ID NO: 1, 5, 6, 7 or 8<br>
(see the Examples section which follows). Depending on the rigidity of the molecular<br>
structure of the peptide used, tubular or spherical nanostructures are formed. Thus, for<br>
example a plurality of diphenylglycine peptides which offer similar molecular<br>
properties as diphenylalenine peptides albeit with a lower degree of rotational freedom<br>
around the additional C-C bond and a higher steric hindrence will self-assemble into<br>
nano spheres, while a plurality of diphenylalenine peptides will self-assemble into<br>
nanotubes.	&gt;   .<br>
The present invention also envisages nanostructures which are composed of a plurality of polyaromatic peptides being longer than the above described (e.g., 50-136 amino acids).<br><br>
As used herein the phrase "polyaromatic peptides" refers to peptides which include at least 80 %, at least 85 % at least 90 %, at least 95 % or more, say 100 % aromatic amino acid residues. These peptides can be homogenic (e.g., polyphenylalanine, see Example 3 of the Examples section which follows) or heterogenic of at least 10, at least 15, at least 20, at least 25, at least 30, at least 35, at least 40, at least 45, at least 50, at least 55, at least 60, at least 65, at least 70, at least 75, at least 80, at least 85, at least 90, at least 95, at least 100, at least 105, at least 110, at least 120, at least 125, at least 130, at least 135, at least 140, at least 145, at least 150, at least 155, at least 160, at least 170, at least 190, at least 200, at least 300, at least 500 amino acids.<br>
The term "peptide" as used herein encompasses native peptides (either degradation products, synthetically synthesized peptides or recombinant peptides) and peptidomimetics (typically, synthetically synthesized peptides), as well as peptoids and semipeptoids which are peptide analogs, which may have, for example, modifications rendering the peptides more stable while in a body or more capable of penetrating into cells. Such modifications include, but are not limited to N terminus modification, C terminus modification, peptide bond modification, including, but not limited to, CH2-NH, CH2-S, CH2-S-0, OC-NH, CH2-0, CH2-CH2, S=C-NH, CH=CH or CF=CH, backbone modifications, and residue modification. Methods for preparing peptidomimetic compounds are well known in the art and are specified, for example, in Quantitative Drug Design, C.A. Ramsden Gd., Chapter 17.2, F. Choplin Pergamon Press (1992), which is incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein. Further details in this respect are provided hereinunder.<br>
Peptide bonds (-CO-NH-) within the peptide may be substituted, for example, by N-methylated bonds (-N(CH3)-CO-), ester bonds (-C(R)H-C-0-0-C(R)-N-),<br>
ketomethylen bonds (-CO-CH2-), a-aza bonds (-NH-N(R)-CO-), wherein R is any alkyl, e.g., methyl, carba bonds (-CH2-NH-), hydroxyethylene bonds (-CH(OH)-CH2-), thioamide bonds (-CS-NH-), olefinic double bonds (-CH=CH-), retro amide bonds (-NH-CO-), peptide derivatives (-N(R)-CH2-CO-), whe-rein R is the "normal" side chain, naturally presented on the carbon atom.<br>
These modifications can occur at any of the bonds along the peptide chain and even at several (2-3) at the same time.<br><br>
Natural aromatic amino acids. Trp, Tyr and Phe, may be substituted for synthetic non-natural acid such as Phenylglycine, TIC, naphthylelanine (Nol), ring-methylated derivatives of Phe, halogenated derivatives of Phe or o-methyl-Tyr.<br>
In addition to the above, the peptides of the present invention may also include one or more modified amino acids (e.g., thiolated amino acids, see Example 2 of the Examples section) or one or more non-amino acid monomers (e.g. fatty acids, complex carbohydrates etc).<br>
As used herein in the specification and in the claims section below the term "amino acid" or "amino acids" is understood to include the 20 naturally occurring amino acids; those amino acids often modified post-translationally in vivo, including, for example, hydroxyproline, phosphoserine and phosphothreonine; and other unusual amino acids including, but not limited to, 2-aminoadipic acid, hydroxylysine, isodesmosine, nor-valine, nor-leucine and ornithine. Furthermore, the term "amino acid" includes both D- and L-amino acids.<br>
Tables 1 and 2 below list naturally occurring amino acids (Table 1) and non-conventional or modified amino acids (Table 2) which can be used with the present invention.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
The nanostructures of the present invention are preferably generated by allowing a highly concentrated aqueous solution of the peptides of the present invention to self-assemble under mild conditions as detailed in Examples 1 and 2 of the Examples section which follows.<br>
The resulting nanostructures are preferably stable under acidic and/or basic pH conditions, a wide range of temperatures (i.e., 4-200 °C) and/or proteolytic conditions (i.e., proteinase K).<br>
Depending on the number and type of amino acids used, the nanostructure can be insulators, conductors or semiconductors. The nanostructure of the present invention can also be utilized as carriers onto which atoms of different materials {e.g., conductive materials, chemical or biological agents, etc.) may be incorporated.<br>
A detailed description of the nanostructure generated according to the teachings of the present invention follows below, starting first with a description of the applications of such nanostructures and the advantages offered thereby.<br>
The nanostructure of the present invention has numerous potential applications. Having a substantially high aspect ratio, the nanostructure of the present invention is an ideal candidate for use in probing application. For example, a nanostructure having a tip diameter of about 10 nm and a length of several micrometers can be used as the tip of an atomic force microscope to probe deep crevices found on integrated circuits, biological molecules or any other nanoscale environment.<br>
Additionally, the nanostructure of the present invention has exceptional material properties. More specifically, due to multiple cooperative forces (hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic packing), the nanostructure is highly robust under extreme pH and temperatures. When another material {e.g., a polymer or a ceramic material) is<br><br>
reinforced with the nanostructure of the present invention, the resulting composition is characterized by a mechanical strength of one or more order of magnitude above the strength of the host material. Such a strong composite material is well suited for many applications such as, but not limited to, in the defense, aerospace and automobile industries.<br>
An additional potential application of the nanostructure of the present invention is in the field of micro- and nanoeiectronic systems. The nanostructure can be combined with silicon chips so as to restrict motion of electrons or holes within a nanoscale region thereby to provide the system with special electric, optical and/or chemical characteristics. For example, the use of nanostructure as gates in an electronic device allows operation at low gate voltage and enables the switching of several individual devices on the same substrate.<br>
As mentioned hereinabove, the nanostructures of the present invention can be hollow. Being both of nanometer scale and hollow, the nanostructures can serve for heat conduction, e.g., by mixing the nanostructures with a fluid (e.g., a cooling liquid).<br>
Still another potential applications of the nanostructure of the present invention is related to enhancement of electromagnetic fields near ultra small metal objects. The physical process of strong field enhancement very close to metal nanoparticles is a well known phenomenon and has been described in detail in the literature. To this end, see, for example, R. H. Doremus and P. Rao, J. Mater. Res., 11, 2834 (1996); M. Quinten, AppL Phys. B 73, 245 (2001) and R. D. Averitt, S. L. Westcott and N. J. Halas, J. Opt. Soc. Am. B 16, 1824 (3999), the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference. In metal nanoparticles, resonant collective oscillations of conduction electrons, also known as particle plasmons, are excited by an optical field. The resonance frequency of a particle plasmons is determined mainly by the dielectric function of the metal, the surrounding medium and by the shape of the particle. Resonance leads to a narrow spectrally selective absorption and an enhancement of the local field confined on and close to the surface of the metal particle. The spectral width of absorption and near-field enhancement depends on the decay time of the particle plasmons. A significant enhancement of the effect of optical field increment may be achieved, by coating the nanostructures of the present invention by a conducting shall layer. Nanoparticles having such structure are called nanoshells.<br><br>
The process of coating nanostructures having a dielectric core and to form a conducting shell, is known in the art and is described in, for example, WO 01/06257 and WO 02/28552, the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
Following are representative examples of applications in which the nanostructure of the present invention is preferably incorporated.<br>
Hence, further in accordance with the present invention there is provided a device for obtaining information from a nanoscale environment. Broadly speaking, this device is capable of serving as an interface between macroscopic systems and individual objects having nanometer dimensions. The device according to this aspect of the present invention may comprise one or more nanostructures, which facilitate information exchange between the macroscopic system and the nanoscale environment. Individual nanostructures or bundles of nanostructures can be recovered from peptides, as further detailed hereinabove, in accordance with the present invention. Assemblies of nanostructures can be fabricated, for example, by self-assembly of groups of nanostructures, as further detailed and exemplified in the Examples section that follows.<br>
Referring now to the drawings, Figure 1 is a schematic illustration of the device described above, which is referred to herein as device 10. In its most basic form, device 10 comprises a nanostructure 12 and a detection system 16. As stated, nanostructure 12 preferably comprises a plurality of peptides, each having no more than 4 amino acids.<br>
Nanostructure 12 serves for collecting signals from a nanoscale environment 14. Any type of signals can be collected by nanostructure 12 including, without limitation, mechanical, optical, electrical, magnetic and chemical signals. Detection system 16 serves for interfacing with nanostructure 12 and receiving the signals collected thereby. Hence, by collecting signals using nanostructure 12 and detecting the signals using system 16, device 10 is capable of sensing, measuring and analyzing nanoscale environment 14.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the present invention device 10 may further comprise a supporting element 18 onto which nanostructure 12 is mounted. Nanostructure 12 is connected to supporting element 18 at one end, with the other end being free and, due to its nanometric dimension, capable of coming into direct contact or near proximity to nanoscale environment 14. Preferably, supporting element 18 can<br><br>
physically scan nanoscale environment 14 to thereby allow nanostructure 12 to collect signals from, or deliver signals to a plurality of locations of nanoscale environment 14. The "sensing end" of nanostructure 12 interacts with objects being sensed, measured or analyzed by means which are (either individually or in combination) physical, electrical, chemical, electromagnetic or biological. This interaction produces forces, electrical currents or chemical compounds which reveal information about the object.<br>
Nanostructure 12 and supporting element 18 in combination can essentially be considered as a transducer for interacting with nanoscale environment 14. Conventional probe microscopy tecliniques are enabled and improved by the use of device 10, according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Examples of conventional systems of this type include scanning tunneling microscopes, atomic force microscopes, scanning force microscopes, magnetic force microscopes and magnetic resonance force microscopes.<br>
Device 10 is fundamentally different from conventional probe microscopy tips in its shape and its mechanical, electronic, chemical and/or electromagnetic properties. This difference permits new modes of operation of many probe microscopes, and new forms of probe microscopy. Device 10 is capable of imaging, at nanoscale resolution or greater, surfaces and other substrates including individual atoms or molecules such as biolmolecules. Device 10 can replace relevant parts (e.g., tips) of any of the above systems.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, supporting element 18 and/or nanostructure 12 may be pre-coated with a layer of conductive material in order to produce a good electrical contact therebetween.<br>
Device 10 is particularly useful when used in tapping mode atomic force microscopy. In this mode, a change in amplitude of an oscillating cantilever driven near its resonant frequency is monitored as nanostructure 12 taps the surface of nanoscale environment 14, The sharp frequency response of high-quality cantilevers makes this technique exquisitely sensitive. Nanostructure 14 has the advantage that it is both stiff below a certain threshold force, but is compliant above that threshold force. More specifically, below the Euler buckling force, there is no bending of nanostructure 12. The Euler buckling force of nanostructure 12 is preferably in the one nano-Newton range. Once the Euler bucking force is exceeded, nanostructure 12<br><br>
bends easily through large amplitudes with little additional force.     In addition, nanostructure 12 is extremely gentle when laterally touching an object.<br>
The result is that gentle, reliable atomic force microscopy imaging may be accomplished in the tapping mode with even extremely stiff, high-resonant frequency cantilevers. In contrast to the hard silicon pyramidal tip of existing systems, which can easily generate impact forces being larger than 100 nano-Newtons per tap, and therefore may substantially modify the geometry of soft samples such as large bio-molecules, nanostructure 12 serves as a compliant probe which moderates the impact of each tap on the surface.<br>
An additional advantage of device 10 is its capability to explore regions of nanoscale environment 14 previously inaccessible to high resolution scanning probes. In this embodiment, nanostructure 12 is preferably of tubular shape so as to allow nanostructure 12 to penetrate into deep trenches of environment 14. Due to the above mention special mechanical characteristics of nanostructure 12 scanning force microscopy imaging of tortuous structures can be achieved without damaging nanostructure 12 or the imaged object.<br>
Device 10 of the present invention can also be utilized to retrieve other types of information from nanoscale environment 14, such as, but not limited to, information typically obtained via conventional friction force microscopy. Friction force microscopy measures the atomic scale friction of a surface by observing the transverse deflection of a cantilever mounted probe tip. The compliance of nanostructure 12 above the Euler threshold as described above, provides for a totally new method of elastic force microscopy. By calibration of the Euler buckling force for nanostructure 12, and making appropriate atomic force microscopy measurements using nanostructure 12, one can obtain direct information about the elastic properties of the object being imaged.<br>
Device 10 may also be used to perform nanoscale surface topography measurement. Motions of supporting element 18 can be calibrated by measurement of surfaces,having known geometries (e.g., pyrolytic graphite with surface steps). Once properly calibrated, supporting element 18 and nanostructure 12 can provide precise measurement of the topography of surfaces and fabricated elements such as vias and trenches on integrated-circuit elements.<br><br>
An additional use of device 10 is in mechanical resonance microscopy, which can be facilitated by mechanical resonances in nanostructure 12. These resonances may be utilized as a means of transduction of information about the object being sensed or modified. Such resonances, as will be known by one skilled in the art, can be sensed by optical, piezoelectric, magnetic and/or electronic means.<br>
Nanostructure 12 can also act as a sensitive antenna for electromagnetic radiation. The response of nanostructure 12 to electromagnetic radiation may be recorded by detecting and measuring frequency currents passing therethrough as it and the object being sensed interact together in a nonlinear way with electromagnetic radiation of two or more frequencies. Via its interaction with electromagnetic fields of specified frequencies, nanostructure 12 may excite electronic, atomic, molecular or condensed-matter states in the object being examined, and the transduction of information about that object may occur by observation of the manifestations of these states.<br>
Also of interest is the use of device 10 for probing biological systems. For example, device 10 can perform DNA sequencing by atomic force microscopy imaging of DNA molecules whereby nanostructure 12, due to its physical and chemical properties, permits the recognition of individual bases in the molecule.<br>
In another biological application, device 10 can also be used for electrical or electrochemical studies of living cells. Knowledge of cell activity can be achieved, e.g., by measuring and recording electrical potential changes occurring within a cell. For example, device 10 of the present invention can accurately monitor specific cytoplasmic ions and cytosolic calcium concentrations with a spatial resolution far superior to those presently available. Living cells which can be studied using device 10 include, without limitations, nerve cell bodies and tissue culture cells such as smooth muscle, cardiac, and skeletal muscle cells.<br>
Additionally, device 10 can be used, for example, to obtain and measure near field light from nanoscale environment 14. For the purpose of providing a self contained document a description of the near field phenomenon precedes &gt;the description of the presently preferred embodiment of the invention.<br>
When light impinges on a boundary surface (such as the surface of nanoscale environment 14) having a varying refractive index at an angle which causes total reflection, the incident light is totally reflected on the boundary surface (reflection<br><br>
plane), in which case the light exudes to the opposite side of the reflection plane. This exuding light is called "near-field light" Other than the foregoing, the near-field light also includes light which exudes from a miniature aperture smaller than the wavelength of the light, through which the light is passed.<br>
The near-field light can be utilized to analyze a surface state (shape, characteristics or the like) of a sample such as semiconductor materials, organic or inorganic materials, vital samples (cells) and the like. An ordinary optical microscope cannot measure a sample at a resolution higher than the wavelength of light due to diffraction of the light. This is called "diffraction limit of light.11 An analysis utilizing near-field light permits measurements at a resolution exceeding the diffraction limit of light.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the present invention nanostructure 12 is adapted to collect near-field light of nanoscale environment 14. As the near-field light incidents on nanostructure 12, electronic excitation are induced therein. These electronic excitations cause a current to flow through nanostructure 12, toward detection system 16 which detects, records and/or analyzes the current.<br>
It is appreciated that the above embodiments merely exemplify the potential use of device 10 for obtaining vital information from a nanoscale environment, previously unattained by conventional systems and apparati. The geometrical shape, nanometric size and physical properties of nanostructure 12 may also be used also for performing tasks, other than, obtaining information.<br>
Nanostructure generated in accordance with the teachings of the present invention can also be utilized as part of a field emitting device.<br>
Hence, according to another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a field emitter device, which is referred to herein as device 20.<br>
Reference is now made to Figure 2a, which is a schematic illustration of a cross sectional view of device 20, according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention. Device 20 preferably comprises an electrode 22 and a nanostructure 12. Electrode 22 and nanostructure 12 are designed and constructed such that when an electrical field is formed therebetween, electrons 27 are extracted from nanostructure 12 by tunneling through the surface potential barrier. Once emitted from nanostructure 12, electrons 27 can be accelerated, redirected and focused so as to energetically excite atoms of a specific material, as further detailed hereinunder.<br><br>
Device 20 may be integrated in many apparati, such as, but not limited to, a field emitter display. In this embodiment, a plurality of nanostructures may be positioned in cross points 28 of a matnx 29 of electrodes. Matrix 29, better illustrated in Figure 2b, is formed of a plurality of row and column electrodes. Thus, each cross point 28 can be addressed by signaling the respective row and column electrodes. Upon a suitable signal, addressed to a specific cross point, the respective bundle of nanostructures 12 emits electrons, in accordance with the above principle.<br>
Device 20 (or the apparatus in which device 20 is employed) may further comprise a substrate 26 having a fluorescent powder coating, capable of emitting light upon activation by the electrons. The fluorescent powder coating may be either monochromatic or multichromatic. Multichromatic fluorescent powder may be, for example, such that is capable of emitting red, green and blue light, so that the combination of these colors provides the viewer with a color image. Device 20 may further comprise a focusing element 25 for ensuring that electrons 27 strike electrode 22 at a predetermined location.<br>
A special use of field emitter device, such as device 20, is in the area of electron beam lithography, in particular when it is desired to achieve a precise critical dimension of order of a few tens of nanometers. The present invention successfully provides an apparatus for electron emission lithography apparatus, generally referred to herein as apparatus 30. As further detailed hereinbelow, apparatus 30 is capable of transferring a pattern of a mask in a nanoscale resolution.<br>
Reference is now made to Figure 3, which is a schematic illustration of apparatus 30. Apparatus 30 comprises an electron emission source 32 and an electrically conducting mounting device 34. According to a preferred embodiment of the present invention, sources 32 includes one or more nanostructures 12, which, as stated, is composed of a plurality of peptides. Source 32 and mounting device 34 are kept at a potential difference, e.g., via a voltage source 36. The potential difference is selected such that electrons are emitted from source 32 (similarly to device 20).<br>
A sample 38, on which an e-beam resist 39 to be patterned is formed, is disposed on mounting device 34, in a predetermined distance apart from a source 32. The electrons emitted from nanostructure 12 perform a lithography process on a sample 38 mounted thereon. Subsequently, if a developing process is performed, portions of resist 39 which were exposed to the emitted electrons remain when the<br><br>
resist 39 is negative, while portions of resist 39 not exposed to an electron beam remain when resist 39 is positive.<br>
Source 32 and mounting device 34 are preferably positioned in a magnetic field generated by a magnetic field generator 37. Magnetic field generator 37 is designed to precisely control a magnetic field according to the distance between nanostructures 12 and resist 39, so that the electrons emitted from nanostructure 12 reach the desired positions on resist 39. Being charged particles moving in a magnetic field, the electrons are subjected to a magnetic force, perpendicular to their direction of motion (and to the direction of the magnetic field vector). Thus, a track of the movement of the electrons is controlled by magnetic field generator 37, which redirect the electron to the desirable position.<br>
Consequently, the shape of nanostructures 12 caa.be projected upon sample 38, to thereby perform a lithographic process thereon. As described above, according to the present invention, since nanostructures 12 are used as electron emission sources, a lithography process can be performed with a precise critical dimension. In addition, since electrons emitted from nanostructures 12 carbon depreciate portions of resist 39 corresponding to nanostructure 12, a deviation between the center of a substrate and the edge thereof are substantially prevented.<br>
An additional use of nanostructure 12 is in the field of information storage and retrieving.<br>
Reference is now made to Figures 4a-b, which are schematic illustration of a<br>
memory cell, generally referred to herein as cell 40. In its simplest configuration, cell<br>
40 comprises an electrode 42 and a nanostructure 12.   Nanostructure 12 preferably<br>
:apable of assuming one of at least two states.   For example, as already described<br>
lereinabove, nanostructure 12 has the capability to deflect when the Euler buckling<br>
ibrce is exceeded, thus, a first state of nanostructure 12 can be a non-deflected state<br>
when an external force applied on nanostructure is below Euler buckling force) and a<br>
econd state of nanostructure 12 can be a deflected state (when the external force is<br>
bove or equals the Euler buckling force).<br>
Nanostructure 12 is preferably be suspended by one or more supports 44 over lectrode 42. Nanostructure 12 may be held in position on support(s) 44 in more than ne way. For example, nanostructure 12 is held in position on support(s) 44 by or any ther means, such as, but not limited to, by anchoring nanostructure 12 to support(s)<br><br>
44. The holding of nanostructure 12 in its place on support(s) 44 can also be facilitated by chemical interactions between nanostructure 12 and support(s) 44, including, without limitation, covalenr bonding.<br>
Electrode 42, nanostructure 12 and the distance therebetween are preferably selected such that electrical current flows through electrode 42 and/or nanostructure 12, generates an electric force on nanostructure 12 which is larger than the Euler buckling force. Thus, temporarily electric current(s) transform nanostructure 12 from the first state (Figure 4a) to the second state (Figure 4b).<br>
A plurality of cells like cell 40 can be incorporated to provide an electromechanical memory array. Each cell in the array can be in either a first state or a second state thus can store a binary information of a first type of datum (say, "0") and a second type of datum (say, "1"). As the size of nanostructure 12 is in the nanometric scale, many such cells can be integrated in a single array so that the information storage capacity of the entire array is substantially larger, or at least equivalent to modern memory devices. Each cell may be read or written by applying currents and or voltages to electrode 42 or nanostructure 12.<br>
More specifically, when nanostructure 12 is in a non-deflected state. (Figure 4a), cell 40 is characterized by an open circuit, which may be sensed as such qn either nanostructure 12 or trace electrode 42 when so addressed. When nanostructure 12 is in a deflected state (Figure 4b), cell 40 is characterized by a rectified junction (e.g., Schottky or PN), which may be sensed as such on either nanostructure 12 or trace electrode 42 when so addressed.<br>
As will be appreciated by one ordinarily skilled in the art, cell 40 (and therefore an integrated array of a plurality of such cells) is characterized by a high ratio of resistance between "0" and "1" states. Switching between these states is accomplished by the application of specific voltages across nanostructure 12 or electrode 42. For example, "readout current" can be applied so that the voltage across a respective junction is determined with a "sense amplifier." It will be appreciated that such reads are non-destructive. More specifically, unlike DRAM systems, where write-back operations are required after each read, cell 40 retains its state even once read is performed.<br><br>
According to another aspect of the present invention, there is provided an electronic device, for switching, inverting or amplifying, generally referred to as device 50.<br>
Reference is now made to Figure 5a, which is a schematic illustration of device 50. Device 50 comprises a source electrode 52, a drain electrode 54, a gate electrode 56 and a channel 58. One or both of gate electrode 56 and channel 58 may comprise a nanostructure (e.g., nanostructure 12) which is composed of a plurality of peptides, as further detailed hereinabove. For example, in one embodiment channel 58 is a nanostructure and gate electrode 56 is preferably layer of SiO? in a silicon wafer.<br>
In its simplest principle, device 50 operates as a transistor. Channel 58 has semiconducting properties (either /i-type or /?-type semiconducting properties) such that the density of charge carriers can be varied. A voltage 57 is applied to channel 58 through gate electrode 56, which is preferably separated from channel 58 by an insulating layer 59. When the voltage of gate electrode 56 is zero, channel 58 does not contain any free charge carriers and is essentially an insulator. As voltage 57 is increased, the electric field caused thereby attracts electrons (or more generally, charge carriers) from source electrode 52 and- drain electrode 54, so that channel 58 becomes conducting.<br>
Thus, device 50 serves as an amplifier or a switching device where, voltage 57 of gate electrode 56 controls the current flowing from source electrode 52 and drain electrode 54, when a bias voltage 53 is applied therebetween.<br>
Two devices like devices 50 may be combined so as to construct an inverter. Referring to Figure 5b, in this embodiment, a first such device (designated 50a) may include a channel having an «-type semiconducting properties and a second such device (designated 50b) may include a channel having an /&gt;-type semiconducting properties. Devices 50a and 50b are preferably connected such that when bias voltage 53 is applied between the source of device 50a ajpd the drain of device 50b, the combined device serves as an inverter between input signal 51 and output signal 55.<br>
Following are several aspects of the present invention in which nanostructure 12 is primarily exploited for performing mechanical tasks.<br>
According to an additional aspect of the present invention, there is provided a mechanical transmission device, generally referred to herein as device 60.<br><br>
Reference is now made to Figure 6, which is a schematic illustration of device 60, according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention. Device 60 comprises a first nanostnicture 12 and a second nanostructure 62, which, as stated are composed of a plurality of peptides. First 12 and second 62 nanostructures are operatively associated thereamongst such that a motion of first nanostructure 12 generates a motion of second nanostructure 62. Both first 12 and second 62 can have any shape suitable for transmitting motion, such as, but not limited to, a tubular or a spherical shape. To facilitate the operative association, one or more molecules 64 (e.g., antibodies, Iigands, DNA, RNA, or carbohydrates) can be attached to the external surface of first 12 and/or second 62 nanostructures.<br>
Hence, device 60 can operate as a nanomachine which could self-repair or adapt to the environment. Preferably, first 12 and/or second 62 nanostructures include oppositely charged atoms on their antipodes, so that an electric field can generate a circular motion. Being of a nanometric size, an extremely small magnitude of electric field is sufficient for rotating the nanostructures, in an extremely large angular velocity, typically in the Giga-Hertz range.<br>
Another mechanical application in which nanostructure 12 can be used is illustrated in Figure 7. In this aspect of the present invention nanostructure 12 is exploited for the purpose of manipulating nanoscale objects. A potential application of the present aspect of the invention is in the area of assembling nanoelectronic circuit (see, e.g., cell 40 or device 50 hereinabove) when nanoscale objects are to be precisely located in a predetermined location.<br>
Figure 7 illustrates a nanoscale mechanical device 70, which comprises at least one nanostructure 12 designed and configured for grabbing and/or manipulating a nanoscale object 74. Such operation may be achieved, for example, using two nanostructures 12, preferably tubular nanostructures, mounted on a mounting device 72, whereby nanostructures 12 perform a constrained motion to grab object 74.<br>
Mounting device 72 can be, for example, a tip end of an atomic force microscopy cantilever, so that one or both of nanostructures 12 can, also be utilized as an atomic force microscopy probe. In use, nanostructures 12 first scan (e.g., as an atomic force microscopy probe) the region where object 74 is expected, thus confirming the position and shape thereof. This scan me be performed in any method<br><br>
known in the art, such as, but not limited to, using a three-dimensional driving mechanism 78.<br>
The motion of nanostructure 12 may be controlled, for example, by a voltage source 76 which generates an electrostatic force between nanostructures 12. Thus, by activating voltage source 76 nanostructures 12 can close or open on object 74.<br>
Once nanostructure 12 grip object 74, which, as stated, has been marked by the atomic force microscopy procedure, mounting device 72 can be moved by three-dimensional driving mechanism 78, to a desired location. Subsequently nanostructures 12 are further opened, thus releasing object 74 in its appropriate location. In cases where object 74 fails to separate from nanostructures 12, e.g., due to Van der Waals forces between object 74 and nanostructures 12, a further voltage can be applied between nanostructures 12 and the desired location, so that object 74 is released by an electrostatic attractive force.<br>
As stated, the nanostructure of the present invention can also be used for reinforcing other materials, such as, but not limited to, polymers. Thus, according to yet an additional aspect of the present invention there is provided composition, in which a polymer is combined with the nanostructure of the present invention. Preferably, the nanostructure is chemically bonded to or integrated within the polymer chains via one or more chemical bond types.<br>
Several attachement configurations can be utilized in order to reinforce polymer chains.<br>
For example, the nanostructure can be linked to one or more chain-terminating group of the polymer chain or to residues of internal polymer groups. The polymer component of the composition of the present invention preferably comprises polymers, including copolymers, which are capable of chemically bonding with the peptides of the nanostructure, or those polymers that can be prepared from one or more monomer precursors capable of bonding with the peptides of the nanostructure either prior to or during polymerization. Representative examples of polymers which may be used include without limitation polyethylene glycol (PEG), polysaccharides, DNA/RNA, poly amino-acids, peptide nucleic acid (PNA) .<br>
The composition described above, can be used for manufacturing many forms of articles, such as filaments, carpets, ropes and the like.<br><br>
/\ noer can De tormed irom the polymer-nanostructure composition by cutting the composition into chips and diying. These chips can then be heated under pressure to bond the chips into a plug. This plug can then be heated to a molten state, passed through a mesh screen, and forced through an extrusion orifice. The filament formed by the molten composite material can then be pulled away from the orifice and wound onto a bobbin. Such fibers can be incorporated into bulked continuous filament, and made into carpets, ropes and the like.<br>
Alternatively, the composition describe above can be used as an injection moldable resin for engineering polymers for use in many applications, such as, but not limited to, filters, solenoids and the like.<br>
The nanostructure of the present invention can also be dispersed throughout a matrix material to thereby form a free-form structure. Constructing and arranging composite nodal elements to define a structure circumvents the common practice in the industry of post-fabrication processing operations. Initially, a structure is often fabricated in a mold or by machining and then subjected to post-fabrication processing operations. Post-fabrication processing operations refer to added steps required beyond initial fabrication so that the structure exhibits desired dimensions and tolerance. Typically, post-processing operations include for example, among others, machining, cleaning, polishing, grinding, deburring and hole drilling so as to achieve desired dimensions and tolerance of a fabricated structure.<br>
Following is a description of an additional embodiment of the present invention in which the nanostructures are used for the purpose of delivering energy from one location to the other.<br>
In many industries, there is a great need for more efficient heat transfer fluids. Heat transfer fluids used in today's conventional thermal systems have inherently poor heat transfer properties. Often, millimeter- or micrometer-sized particles are suspended in heat transfer fluids so as to increase the capability of the fluid to deliver heat. The ratio of surface area to volume of the nanostructure of the present invention is about three orders of magnitudes larger than that of micrometer-sized particles. Since heat transfer occurs on the surface of a fluid, this feature of the present invention can be used for significantly enhancing heat conduction properties of cooling fluids.<br>
Thus, according to a further aspect of the present invention there is provided, a nanofluid, comprising the nanostructures of the present invention suspended in a fluid.<br><br>
The nanofluid of the present invention is characterized extreme stability and ultra-high thermal conductivity.<br>
The present invention successfully provides a heat transfer device 80 which exploits the above mentioned thermal properties of the nanofluid.<br>
Reference is now made to Figure 8, which is a schematic illustration of device 80. Device 80 comprises a nanofluid 82 and a channel 84 for holding nanofluid 82. As stated, nanofluid 82 comprises nanostructures 12 suspended in a fluid 86, where at least a portion of nanostructures 12 is composed of a plurality of peptides, as further detailed hereinabove and in accordance with the present invention. Channel 84 is preferably constructed such that heat is transferred by nanofluid 82, and, in particular, by nanostructure 12, from a first end 87 to a second end 88 of channel 84.<br>
Channel 84 is preferably in a micrometer size (Le,, a microchannel) or a nanometer size (i.e., a nanochannel), both are known in the art. In the embodiment in which channel 84 is a nanochannel, the diameter thereof is larger that the diameter of the largest nanostructure, so as to allow nanofluid 82 to flow freely through channel 84.<br>
Device 80 may further comprise a locomotion system 89 for generating locomotion of nanofluid 82 within channel 84. System 89 may operate in any way known in the art for generating locomotion of nanofluid 82. For example, in one embodiment, the locomotion of nanofluid 82 can be achieved by an under-pressure formed in channel 84, in which case system 89 generates under-pressure. In another embodiment, fluid locomotion can be achieved by dielectrophoretic forces applied thereon, in which case system 89 can be realized, for example, as a mechanism for generating a non-uniform electric field.<br>
Following is a description of additional embodiments of the present invention in which the nanostructures described hereinabove are coated by a conducting shell to form the nanpshell further detailed hereinabove.<br>
Hence, according to yet another aspect of the present invention there is provided a composition for modulated delivery of a chemical to a predetermined location. The composition comprises a plurality of nanoshells, each nanoshell having a nanostructure core and a conductive shell which is capable of converting incident radiation into heat energy. The nanostructure core is composed of a plurality of peptides, as further detailed hereinabove.    The composition further comprises a<br><br>
medium having the chemical and a thermally responsive material (e.g., a thermally responsive hydrogels) in thermal contact with the nanoshells.<br>
Composites of thermally responsive hydrogels are known in the art. For example, copolymers of N-isopropylaciylamide (NIPAAm) and acrylamide (Mm) exhibit a lower critical solution temperature (LCST) that is slightly above body temperature. When the temperature of the copolymer exceeds the LCST, the hydrogel collapses, causing a rapid release or burst of any soluble material held within the hydrogel matrix.<br>
The nanoshells serve as heat transfer agents within the polymer matrix. Each of the nanoshells may also include a targeting component, such as an affinity component having an affinity to the cells in the location of interest. Being of nanometric diameter, the nanoshells have well defined wavelength absorbance maxima across the visible and infrared range of the electromagnetic spectrum. Preferably, the conductive shell of the nanoshells is made of gold. A gold shell can be fabricated, for example, by seeding the amine groups OF the nanostructure core with colloidal gold; additional colloidal gold is added via chemical reduction in solution, to form the gold shell layer.<br>
The wavelength of maximum optical absorption of each nanoshell is determined by the ratio of the core radius to the shell thickness. Each of these variables (core radius and shell thickness) can be independently controlled during fabrication of the nanoshells. Varying the shell thickness, core diameter, and the total diameter of the nanoshell, allows the optical properties of the nanoshells to be tuned over the visible and near-infrared spectrum.<br>
In order to convert light energy into heat, administered nanoshells are exposed to light at an appropriate wavelength {e.g., 800-1200 nm) which is transmitted through tissue. The generated heat causes collapse of the hydrogel in the vicinity of the nanoshell causes significantly enhanced release of chemicals and proteins of varying molecular weight from the new composite hydrogels.<br>
Since it is capable of converting light energy into heat, the nanoshell of the present invention can be used to induce localized hyperthermia in a cell or tissue of an individual and thus can be utilized as therapeutic agent in treatment of various diseases such as hyperproliferative diseases, as detailed hereinbelow.<br><br>
For example, an individual having cancer can be administered with a therapeutic effective amount of the nanoshells of the present invention using a suitable administration route and thereafter exposed to electromagnetic radiation in the resonance frequency of the nanoshells, e.g., using a continues wave or pulse laser device, for a time period of, say, about 5-30 minutes to thereby convert the electromagnetic radiation into heat energy. The generated heat may is preferably sufficient to perform therapeutic treatment, e.g., to kill the cells, if so desired.<br>
Preferably, the electromagnetic radiation is in the near infrared range. Such radiation is advantageous for its ability to penetrate tissue. Other types of radiation can also be used, depending on the selection of the conductive shells and the targeted cells. Examples include x-rays, magnetic fields, electric fields and ultrasound.<br>
As stated, the method may be used for destroying living cells. In this embodiment, each of the nanoshells may include an affinity component having affinity to the living cells to be destroyed. Thus, the present invention can be used to treat many types of cancers, such as, but not limited to, vaginal cancer, vulvar cancer, cervical cancer, endometrial cancer, ovarian cancer, rectal cancer, salivary gland cancer, laryngeal cancer, nasopharyngeal cancer, many lung metastases and acute or chronic leukemia (e.g., lymphocytic, Myeloid, hairy cell).<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the affinity component of the nanoparticles includes a moiety which may be, for example an antibody, an antigen, a ligand or a substrate.<br>

Other applications of the nanostructures of tbve present invention include use thereof in biomedical sciences and in biotechnology such as their use as vehicles for enzyme encapsulation [Chang (2001) Mol. Biotechnol. 17:249-260], DNA transfection [Kneuer (2000j Bioconj. Chem. 11:926-932; Rader (1997) Science 810-814; Koltover (1998) Science 281:78-81], scaffolds for tissue building, biosensors<br><br>

Rev. 99:3181-3198; Lee (2002) Biomacromolecules 3:1115-1119; Murthy (2002) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 124:12398-12399]. For example, drugs can be incorporated onto the biodegradable nanospheres of the present invention, to thereby allow for timed release of the drug as the nanosphere degrades. The conditions which allow degradation can be adjusted by varying the chemical bonding within the nanostructure. For example, when acid-labile bonds are used, the nanostructures of the present invention will degrade in an acidic environment such as would exist in a site of inflammation or in tumor cells. Alternatively, the nanostructures of the present invention can be coated with viral peptide sequences which promote membrane-permeation. Finally, surface functionalized nanostructures of the present invention can also be used to deliver genetic material into living cells (i.e., transfection).<br>
In any of the above embodiments, the nanostructures can be coated by any suitable material, e.g., a conductive material (as in the case of the nanoshells), a semiconductive material or a dielectric material, and can be bounded to other molecules to achieve desired electrical, mechanical, chemical or biological properties. For example, the nanostructures of the present invention can be coated by silver, gold and other conductive materials.<br>

EXAMPLE 1 Nanotubes self-assembly of Alzheimer's fi-amyloid core recognition element Materials and Experimental Procedures<br>
Material - Peptides (NH2-Phe-Phe-COOH, SEQ ID NO: 1) were purchased<br>
from Bachem (Budendorf, Switzerland). Freshly prepared stock solution was<br>
prepared by dissolving lyophilized form of the peptide in l,l7l,3,3,3,-Hexafluoro-2-<br>
propanol at a concentration of 100 mg/ml. To avoid any pre-aggregation, fresh stock<br>
solution were prepared for each experiment.	.   .<br>
Transmission Electron microscopy (TEM) - Peptide stock solution was diluted to a final concentration of 2 mg/ml in double distilled water, then a 10 [il aliquot of the peptide suspension was placed on a 200mesh copper grid, covered with carbon stabilized formvar film. Following 1 minute, excess fluid was removed and the grid was negatively stained with 2 % uranyl acetate in water. Following 2 minutes of staining, excess fluid was removed from the grid. Samples were viewed in JEOL 1200EX electron microscope operating at 80 kV.<br>
Scanning Electron microscopy (SEM) - Peptide stock solution was diluted to a final concentration of 0.5 mg/ml in double distilled water. Thereafter a 30 |il aliquot was allowed to dry on microscope glass cover slips. The sample was than coated with gold. Scanning electron microscopy images were made in JSM JEOL 6300 SEM operating at 20 kV.<br>
Congo red staining and birefringence - Peptide stock solutions were diluted to a final concentration of 0.25 mg/ml in double distilled water. Thereafter a 10 |il aliquot was allowed to dry on glass microscope slide. Staining was effected by adding a solution of 80 % ethanol saturated with Congo red and NaCl. Birefringence was determined with a SZX-12 Stereoscope (Olympus, Hamburg, Germany), equipped with a polarizing stage.<br>
Dynamic light scattering - Freshly prepared peptide stock solution at a concentration of 10 mg/ml were diluted in double distilled water to a final concentration range of 0.01 to 0.5 mg/ml.    Experiments were conducted with protein solutions DynaPro MS-<br><br>
800 instrument (Protein Solutions, Lakewood, NJ).      Autocorrelation data was fitted using dynamics V6 software to derive hydrodynamic diameters.<br>
Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy - Infrared spectra were recorded using Nicolet Nexus 470 FT-IR spectrometer with DTGS detector. Sample of aged peptide solution, taken from electron microscopy experiment was vacuum dried on CaF2 plate to form a thin film. Peptide deposits were resuspended in double distilled water and dried. The suspension procedure was repeated twice to ensure maximal hydrogen to deuterium exchange. Measurements were effected using a 4 cm"' resolution and 2000 scan averaging. The transmittance minimum values were determined by 03VINIC analysis software (Nicolet).<br>
Results Very concentrated peptide solution (i.e., 100 mg/ml) were prepared by dissolving the lyophilized peptide in 1,1,1,3.3,3 hexafluoro-2-propanol. While the peptide appeared to be highly soluble in the organic solvent, a rapid assembly into ordered semi-crystalline structures was visually observed within seconds after dilution into the aqueous solution at a final mM concentration range. Assembly into supramolecular structures was determined within minutes at the JIM range, using dynamic light scattering analysis (data not shown).<br>
Tranmission Electron microscopy indicated that the peptides form well-ordered, thin (i.e., 50-60 nm in diameter) and elongated (i.e., several micron long) assemblies (Figure 9a). The formed structures were ordered but clearly different from typical amyloid fibrils, as they formed stiff tubules which lacked a typical branching and curving. Interestingly, these assembies resembled the previously reported tubules formed by hepta - octopeptides [Vauthey (2002) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 99:5355].<br>
SEM electron microspcopy was effected to study the tubular structures formed by the diphenylalanine peptides. As shown in Figure 9b, SEM analysis indicated a typical nanotubular structures similar to those previously reported [Vauthey (2002) Proc.   Natl.   Acad.   Sci.   USA 99:5355].<br>
To elucidate the molecular configuration of the assembled structures, fourier-transformed infrared spectroscopy was effected. As shown in Figure 9c, the spectral analysis of the assemblies indicated a sharp 1630 cm"1 pick at the amide I region. This pick was consistent with a P-sheet -like conformation of the single amide bond, as<br><br>
was suggested for peptide nanotubes built from larger building blocks [Ghadiri (1993) Nature 366:324; Vauthey (2002) Supra] and for amyloid fibrils [Reches (2002) J Biol Chem277(38):35475-80].<br>
Congo red staining of the supramoleuclar structures formed by the dipeptides of the present invention showed a green-gold birefringence typical of amyloid structures (Figure 9d).<br>
Altogether, these results show that a small recognition motif of the p-amyloid polypeptide contains all molecular information required to mediate self-assembly into regular structures. Noteworthy is the fact that the tubular structures were observed with SEM in the absence of coating, suggesting that such structures can be used to as conductive tubes.<br>
The persistence length of the nanotubes appeared to be at the order of micrometers as evident by the microscopic observation. It is worth noting, that the formation of the tubular structures was very efficient. Most assemblies, as observed by TEM analysis had tubular structures and almost no amorphous aggregates were detected (
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to further study the tubular structures (Figures lla-b). The nanotubes were applied on a glass cover slip coated with gold and imaged by SEM. The low magnification micrographs of areas filled ► with individual nanotubes (Figure 11a), substantiated that the tubes were relatively homogenous and evidently individual entities with a persistence length in the order of micrometer. Figure lie shows the statistical distribution of the diameters of the nanotubes.      In this context, it is worth noting that the crystal structure of the<br><br>
diphenylalanine peptide, as formed by evaporation of aqueous solution at 80 °C, showed a crystal packing of aligned and elongated long hollows [Gorbitz (2001) Chemistry 38:6791], These structures were also referred to as peptide nanotubes. However, it is very clear from the present structural analysis, that the crystal packing of the peptide represents a completely different molecular arrangement as compared to the self-assembled individual tubular structures. Higher magnification SEM analysis also .indicated a typical nanotubular structures that resembled, to some extent, a class of peptide nanotubes that were recently reported [Vauthey (2002) supra], albeit apparently stiffer and discrete (Figure 1 lb).<br>
For other applications, such as the assembly of nanotube based biosensors or hollow tubing of nanofluidic circuits, enzymatically stable nanotubes are desired. To assemble such stable tubes, proteolyticaily stable building blocks based on the D-amino-acids analogue of the peptide, NH2-D-Phe-D-Phe-COOH (SEQ ID NO: 8) were used. This peptide formed nanotubes with the same structural features as the corresponding L-amino-acids peptide (Figure 12a). Remarkably, following one hour of incubation of the peptide with 0.02 mg/ml of Proteinase K, no tubular structures were observed by electron microscopy examination, as compared to hundreds of tubular structures observed prior to proteolysis. In a mark difference, no significant variation could be observed before and after the incubation of the D-Phe-D-Phe peptide with the enzyme.<br>
In light of the formation of nanotubes by such short dipeptide, the ability of other aromatic dipeptides (e.g., Phe-Trp. Trp-Tyr, Trp-Phe, and Trp-Trp) was tested under similar conditions. As shown in Figure 12b and Figures 13a-c, nanoscale tubular structures were also observed upon assembly of the Phe-Trp peptide (Figure 12b). However, a significant amount of amorphous aggregates were also observed. This is in mark difference to the Phe-Phe peptide in which practically only tubular structures were observed.<br>
A mechanical model for the formation of the peptide nanotubes described above is provided in Figure 14. Briefly, a stacking interaction between aromatic moieties of the peptides is suggested to provide energetic contribution as well as order and directionality for the initial interaction. The spectroscopic evidence of (3-sheet conformation of the single amide bond is reflected by an extension of the amino acids to the opposite sides and the formation of an extended pleated sheet that is stabilized by<br><br>
hydrogen bonds and aromatic stacking interactions.   The formation of the tubular structures may occur by a closure of the extended sheet as previously suggested.<br>
EXAMPLE 2 Formation of Fullerene-like closed-cage structures by self-assembly of aromatic<br>
dipeptides Materials and Experimental Procedures<br>
Materials - The diphenylalanine and diphenylglycine peptides were purchase from Bachem (Bubendorf, Switzerland, SEQ ID NOs: 1 and 6, respectively). The CFF peptide was purchase from SynPep (Dublin CA, USA). Fresh stock solutions of the diphenylalanine and the diphenylglycine were prepared by dissolving lyophilized form of the peptides in l,l,l,3,3,3-hexafluoro-2- propanol (HFP, Sigma) at a concentration of 100 mg/ml.<br>
The CFF peptide was prepared by dissolving lyophilized form of the peptide in HFP and 25% dithiothreitol, 1 M in ddH20 to a final concentration of 25 mg\ml. To avoid any pre-aggregation, fresh stock solutions were prepared for each experiment. The peptides stock solutions were diluted into^ final concentration of 2 mg/ml in double distilled water.<br>
Chemical Modification of an Amine to a Thiol - The diphenylalnine peptide was dissolved in HFP to a concentration of 100 mg/ml. This was followed by the addition of 2 ^il of the solution to 8 \i\ of 100 mg/ml 2-iminothiolane (Sigma) dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) with 2% N,N- diisopropylethylamine (DIAE). Double distilled water was added to give a final peptide concentration of 2 mg/ml. Two control reactions were effected to exclude components of the reaction mixture in the assembly of the peptides; Essentially, in the first control experiment the reaction mixture was prepared without the addition of DIAE. In the second control experiment, the reaction mixture was prepared without the addition of DIAE and 2-iminothiolane.<br>
Transmission Electron Microscopy - Following 24 hours of incubation at room temperature, a 10 JJ.1 aliquot of the peptide solution was placed on 200 mesh copper grid. After 1 minute, 14 excess fluid was removed. In negative staining experiments, the grid was stained with 2% uranyl acetate in water and after two minutes excess fluid was removed from the grid.      Samples from the chemical<br><br>
reaction that modifies amines to thiols were not negatively stained with uranyl acetate. Samples were viewed using a JEOL 1200EX electron microscope operating at 80 kV.<br>
Atomic Force Microscopy - AFM samples were prepared by drying the peptide solutions on TEM grids, without the staining procedure. Semicontact mode imaging was performed on a P47 solver - NT-MDT (Moscow, Russia), by using OTESP integrated cantilever probes with resonance frequency 390 kHz.<br>
High Resolution Scanning Electron Microscopy - TEM grids that were used for AFM analysis were viewed using JSM-6700 Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope equipped with cold filed emission gun operating at lkV.<br>
Stability in Alkaline and Acidic Conditions - In the case of stability to alkaline conditions, NaOH was added into the peptide nanosphere solution to a final concentration of 1 M NaOH. In the case of stability in acidic conditions, TFA was added to the nanostructure solution to a final concentration of 10% TFA. After 5 hours peptide solutions were placed on TEM grids and analyzed by TEM.<br>
Results<br>
In search for the simplest biomolecular self-assembled system, the most generic form of an aromatic dipeptide, the diphenylglycine was designed and synthesized (Figure 15b). The diphenylglycine offers similar molecular properties as the diphenylalanine peptide albeit its molecular structure is more rigid with a lower degree of freedom due to the lack of rotational freedom around the additional C-C bond and the higher steric hindrance of the molecule.<br>
Structural analysis using TEM (transmission electron microscopy) revealed that under the same conditions that peptide nanotubes were formed by the diphenylalanine, spherical nanometric structures self-assembled by the diphenylglycine peptide (Figures 15c-d). These nanometric particles existed as individual entities and had a uniform spherical appearance as seen by TEM visualization (Figure 15d). The assembly of the spherical particles was very efficient and regular, as could be seen using low magnification TEM analysis (Figure 15d). The efficiency and regularity were similar to those observed with the peptide nanotubes (see Example 1, above).<br>
In order to further examine the three dimensional characteristics of the novel nanoparticles   they   were   subjected   to   analysis   by   SEM   (scanning   electron<br><br>
microscopy). Cold field emission gun (CFEG) high-resolution scanning electron microscope (HRSEM) confirmed the three dimensional spherical shape and the regularity of the self assembled nanostructures (Figure 16a).<br>
In addition, AFM (atomic force microscopy) analysis was employed to get an independent indication about the topography of nanostructures. The AFM analysis clearly confirmed the three dimensional spherical configuration of the nanostructures (Figures 16b-c).<br>
It will be appreciated that while AFM is a less suitable tool to determine the exact dimensions of the structures at the horizontal and vertical axis due to tip convolution, it is an excellent method to determine the height of nanostructures at the Z-range. Indeed, AFM analysis clearly indicated that the spheres are about 90 nm in height (Figure 16b), which is consistent with both TEM and SEM analysis.<br>
The stability of the newly discovered nanoparticles under extreme chemical conditions was addressed as well (Figures 17a-b). The nanospheres were found to be stable under acidic conditions following incubation for 5 hours at 10% TFA as they maintained their configuration and uniform structure (Figure 17a). The stability of the nanospheres was also tested under alkaline conditions i.e., 1M NaOH for 5 hours (Figure 17b). In the presence of NaOH, the nanosphere structure appeared to be more uniform while having a smaller diameter. This remarkable stability of the nanoparticles is very intriguing both from the scientific point of view as well as the technological one. The significant stability of the peptide nanostructures is rare but consistent with the structural stability of amyloid fibrils as was recently reported [Scheibel (2003) Proc.   Natl.   Acad.   Sci.  USA 100:4527].<br>
These results are in accordance with the apparent role of peptide motifs in the molecular recognition and self-assembly of amyloid fibrils. Moreover, the unusual stability of the peptide nanostructures is extremely useful for their use as part of a combined (bio)organic and/or inorganic nanoscale fabrication process, including optic and electron-beam lithographic protocols. Although biologically based scaffolds offer many advantages to nanotechnology, their relative instability in general questions their ability to serve in robust and long-lasting nanodevices.<br>
The newly described peptide nanostructures offer both molecular recognition and chemical flexibility of biological nano-objects, together with stability that is compatible with industrial procedures and the requirements for robust and stable<br><br>
In parallel experiments, the ability of the cysteinediphenylalanine tripeptide (CFF, SEQ ID NO: 7, Figure 18a) to form peptide nanotubes was addressed. The rationale behind these studies was to introduce a thiol group into the nanotubes that would allow their covalent attachment to fabricated gold electrodes in nanodevices. However, as shown in Figures lSb-c, CFF peptide did not self-assemble into nanotubes but rather into nanospheres that were very similar to those formed by the diphenylglycine peptide.<br>
To study whether the spherical structures that were formed by the CFF peptide were the result of the peptide length or rather the presence of the thiol group, an amine was chemically modified into a thiol in the context of the diphenylalanine peptide (Figure 18d). For that purpose, 2-iminothiolane (Traut's reagent), which reacts with the single primary amine in the diphenylglycine and introduces a sulfhydryl group was used. The peptide was reacted with the reagent in organic solvent mixture that was then followed by dilution into an aqueous solution that allowed the self-assembly process. As shown in Figure 18d, the addition of a thiol group to the diphenylalnine peptide transformed the geometry of the assembled structures from nanotubular into spherical ones. As a control, the same reaction mixture was used but without the addition of the N, Ndiisopropylethylamine base that is required for the reaction. Under these conditions only nanotubular structures were observed.<br>
The study of inorganic nanotubes and fiillerene-like structures, indicated that the formation of fullerenes is not unique to carbon and is attributed to a genuine property of two-dimensional (i.e., layered) compounds [Tenne (1992) Nature 360:444; Feldman (1995) Science 267:222; Chhowalla (2000) Nature 407:164; Tenne (2002) Chemistry 23:5293].<br>
As meniotned hereinabove, it is highly likely that the novel type of peptide nanotubes is being formed by a closure of a two dimensional layer. The results described herein provide further experimental support to this notion. It appear? that the energetic contribution provided by the disulphide bridge formation may allow closure of the two-dimensional layer into more closely packed spherical structures. Taken together, there results clearly suggest that aromatic peptide assemblies represent a novel class of nanostructures that are mechanistically closely- related to<br><br>
aromatic carbon nanotubes and fullerenes and to their related inorganic nanotubes and fullerene-like structures. Applications, methodologies, and theories that were applied to the study of carbon and inorganic nanostructures should be of great importance for future exploration and utilization of the peptide nanostructures. These properties of the peptide nanostructures, taken together with their biological compatibility and remarkable thermal and chemical stability, may provide very important tools for future nanotechnology applications.<br>
EXAMPLE 3 Formation of Tubular Nanostructures by Self-Assembly of Poly phenylalanine<br>
peptide<br>
The ability of polyphenylalanine peptides of 50-136 amino acids to self assemble into discrete nanotubes was examined.<br>
Materials and Experimental Procedures<br>
Materials - The Polyphenylalanine peptide was purchase from Sigma-Aldrich (Cat. No. p7011). Fresh stock solution was prepared by dissolving lyophilized form of the peptide in dichloroacetic acid at a concentration of 5 mg/ml and was incubated for an hour in a water bath pre heated to 85 °C. To avoid any pre-aggregation, fresh stock solutions were prepared for each experiment. The peptide stock solution was diluted into double-distilled water to a final concentration of 2.5 mg/ml.<br>
Scanning electron microscopy - A 30 \i\ suspension of 1 day aged peptide solution was dried at room temperature on a microscope glass cover slip and coated with gold. Scanning electron microscopy images were made using a JSM JEOL 6300 SEM operating at 20 kV.<br>
Congo red (CR) staining and birefringence - A 10 \x\ suspension of a 1 day aged peptide solution was allowed to dry overnight on a glass microscope slide. Staining was preformed by the addition of 10 }il solution of 80% ethanol saturated with CR and NaCl. The slide was allowed to dry for a few hours at room temperature. Birefringence was determined with a SZX-12 Stereoscope equipped with cross-polarizes.<br>
Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy - Infrared spectra were recorded using Nicolet Nexus 470 FT-IR spectrometer with a DGTS detector. A 30 fil suspension of 1 day aged polypeptide solution was dried by vacuum on a CaF? plate to<br><br>
torm thin film. The peptide deposits was resuspended in double distilled water and dried. The resuspension procedure was repeated twice to ensure maximal hydrogen to deuterium exchange. The measurements were taken using a 4 cm"1 resolution and 2000 scans averaging. The transmittance minima values were determined by OMNIC analysis program (Nicolet). Results<br>
As shown in Figure 19a structural analysis using SEM (scanning electron microscopy) showed that under similar conditions by which peptide nanotubes were formed by the diphenylalanine, tubular nanometric structures self-assembled by polyphenylalanine peptides of 50-136 amino acid residues. These nanometric particles existed as individual entities and their assembly was very efficient. The efficiency and homogeneity were similar to those observed with the peptide nanotubes self assembled by diphenylalanine peptides (see Example 1 above). Nanotubes of polyphenylalanine showed an apple green birefringence as seen upon Congo red sating and visualization under crossed polarized light (Figure 19b). An amide I FT-IR spectrum of the polyphenylalanine solution exhibited a minimum at 1632 cm"1 that is indicative of a parallel P-sheet structure (Figure 19c). These properties are consistent with biophysical properties of peptide nanotubes self assembled by diphenylalanine peptides.<br>
