COMPLETE : The following specification particularly describes the<br>
invention and the manner in which is to be performed.<br><br>
DESCRIPTION	<br>
PROCESS FOR PRODUCTION OF SUBSTITUTED CYCLOPENTANONE<br>
Technical Field<br>
[0001]<br>
The present invention relates to a process for producing a cis-2,3-disubstituted<br>
cyclopentanone useful as a jasmine fragrance, an intermediate thereof or the like, and<br>
to an intermediate useful for producing the substituted cyclopentanone and a process<br>
for producing the intermediate.<br>
Background Art<br>
[0002]<br>
A 2,3-disubstituted cyclopentanone is an important compound for the<br>
synthesis of useful chemical substances such as a jasmine fragrance and<br>
prostaglandins. Among others, those having an alkoxycarbonylmethyl group at the<br>
3-position are important for the synthesis of a jasmine fragrance, and many<br>
production processes have been disclosed so far.<br>
[0003]<br>
For example, there are disclosed a process using cyclopentanone as a raw<br>
material (Non-patent Document 1) and a process using adipic acid as a raw material<br>
(Non-patent Document 2). These processes provide a thermodynamically stable<br>
stereoisomer, that is, a trans-2,3-disubstituted cyclopentanone in which substituents<br>
at the 2,3-positions are in the trans relationship with each other with respect to the<br>
five-membered ring. The percentage of the cis-isomer is generally only 10% or less.<br>
However, as a result of recent studies, it has been found that, in a jasmonate which<br>
occupies an important position in a jasmine fragrance, a cis-2,3-disubstituted<br><br>
cyclopentanone has a considerably stronger scent than a trans-2,3-disubstituted<br>
cyclopentanone (Non-patent Document 3). Thus, development of industrial<br>
processes for producing a cis-2,3-disubstituted cyclopentanone is strongly desired.<br>
However, as described above, many of conventional techniques provide a trans-2,3-<br>
disubstituted cyclopentanone as a main component.<br>
[0004]<br>
As a technique to compensate for such a difficulty, there is disclosed a<br>
process for producing a cis-2,3-disubstituted cyclopentanone by using a catalyst to<br>
isomerize the resulting trans-2,3-disubstituted cyclopentanone (patent Document 1).<br>
However, in the case of this technique, not only a special apparatus and a special step<br>
are required for isomerization, but also a high temperature of 160 to 190°C is<br>
required for isomerization, which inevitably causes thermal degradation. There is a<br>
problem that a special apparatus and a special step are further required for removing<br>
high boiling impurities produced due to the degradation. In addition, the<br>
concentration of the resulting cis-isomer (epimer) is only about 40%.<br>
[0005]<br>
On the other hand, as a process for selectively synthesizing a cis-2-<br>
substituted-3-alkoxycarbonylmethyl cyclopentanone, there is known a process for<br>
hydrogenating the double bond in a 2-substituted-3-alkoxycarbonylmethyl<br>
cyclopentenone.<br>
[0006]<br>
Patent Document 2 discloses a process of catalytic hydrogenation in the<br>
presence of aluminum alcoholate. The process can provide a desired cis-2-<br>
substituted-3-alkoxycarbonylmethyl cyclopentanone at a selectivity of 90% or. more.<br>
However, in addition to restrictions on reaction operation and equipment that require<br>
pressurization of 3 to 10 kg/cm , it is necessary to use an equivalent amount of<br>
aluminum alcoholate as a third component. Moreover, since the aluminum<br><br>
alcoholate added is decomposed by an aqueous acetic acid solution or the like after<br>
the reaction, a large amount of aluminum-based wastes are generated, making post-<br>
processing difficult. Further, the process also has a difficulty in that the catalyst is<br>
polluted with these wastes to make recycling of the catalyst difficult.<br>
[0007]<br>
Patent Document 3 discloses a process of hydrogenation in the presence of a<br>
ruthenium complex having a specific ligand. This document describes that a desired<br>
cis-2-substituted-3-alkoxycarbonylmethyl cyclopentanone can be obtained at a high<br>
selectivity of 99% or more. However, in addition to the necessity of using a very<br>
expensive catalyst of ruthenium, it is necessary to use a special and expensive<br>
compound also for the ligand. A complicated pretreatment is also required for the<br>
catalyst beforehand. Further, since the process requires a very high hydrogen<br>
pressure of 10 to 90 kg/cm , restrictions on reaction operation and equipment are<br>
very large. Furthermore, the technique has a serious difficulty in the industrial<br>
implementation thereof in that, since it uses a homogeneous catalyst (dissolved in a<br>
solvent), a special operation is required for the separation of the catalyst and the<br>
product after reaction. Moreover, in the above technique, since a specific ligand,<br>
which is added as a third component, is dissociated from the ruthenium complex<br>
based on the dissociation equilibrium, part of the ligand may be transferred to the<br>
product. As a result, there was a serious drawback that the composition of a catalyst<br>
composition was changed in the catalyst separation operation after reaction and the<br>
reproducibility of the catalyst performance was not obtained.<br>
[0008]<br>
Patent Document 4 discloses a process of hydrogenation in the presence of a<br>
rhodium-carbon catalyst in combination with a phosphate or the like. This<br>
document describes that a desired cis-2-substituted-3-alkoxycarbonylmethyl<br>
cyclopentanone can be obtained at a high selectivity of 90% or more at ordinary<br><br>
pressure. However, according to an experiment by the present inventors, the<br>
selectivity of a cis-2-substituted-3-alkoxycarbonylmethyl cyclopentanone showed a<br>
very low value of 30% or less. Further, according to the above technique, it is<br>
necessary to add a salt such as phosphate as a third component. However, since<br>
such a salt has a certain solubility in an organic solvent such as methanol, part of the<br>
salt transfers to the product in the catalyst separation operation (filtration of the<br>
catalyst) after reaction. As a result, there was a serious drawback that the<br>
composition of a catalyst composition was changed and the reproducibility of the<br>
catalyst performance was not obtained. As described above, a technique which can<br>
selectively synthesize a cis-2-substituted-3-alkoxycarbonylmethyl cyclopentanone<br><br>
and has proved satisfactory in terms of industrial implementation has not yet been<br>
reported.<br>
[0009]<br>
On the other hand, a family of 1,3-cyclopentanediones includes very useful<br>
compounds for organic synthesis and useful compounds also as precursors for<br>
producing a substituted cyclopentanone according to the present invention.<br>
However, they are substances which are far more difficult to synthesize than<br>
expected from the apparently simple molecular structure thereof (Non-patent<br>
Document 4).<br>
[0010]<br>
Among others, 1,3-cyclopentanedione itself, which not only has a<br>
fundamental structure but also is very useful, is particularly difficult to synthesize.<br>
Typical processes for synthesizing 1,3-cyclopentanediones reported so far are<br>
illustrated below. A first process is a process for reacting succinic acid with acyl<br>
chloride in the presence of aluminum chloride (Non-patent Document 5).<br>
According to this process, 1,3-cyclopentanediones can be synthesized in one step,<br>
but the yield shows a very low value of 50%. Moreover, according to this process,<br><br>
it is necessary to use a large excess of aluminum chloride and acyl chloride, that is.<br>
2.4 times by mole and 4 times by mole, respectively, relative to the amount of<br>
succinic acid as a raw material. This causes production of a large amount of bγ-<br>
product. In addition, it is necessary to use an explosive solvent such as nitrobenzene<br>
as a solvent. Thus, it is difficult to consider the above process as a satisfactory<br>
process from the standpoint of industrial implementation. Further, since it is known<br>
that 1,3-cyclopentanedione which not only has a fundamental structure but also is<br>
very useful, cannot be synthesized by the above process (Non-patent Document 4),<br>
the above process cannot be a universal process for synthesizing 1,3-<br>
cyclopentanediones. A second process is a process for cyclizing a 4-oxoalkanoate<br>
with a base. Although this process is also a process in which a 1,3-<br>
cyclopentanedione can be synthesized in one step, the yield of 1,3-cyclopentanedione<br>
which not only has a fundamental structure but also is very useful, is low. 1,3-<br>
cyclopentanedione cannot be produced at all by using a general base (Non-patent<br>
Document 6) and can be obtained in at most 60% yield (Non-patent Document 7)<br>
only when a special base (potassium triphenylmethoxide) is used. Furthermore,<br>
even in the case of a long chain 4-oxoalkanoate which is considered to undergo<br>
cyclization relatively easily, the yield is as low as about 35 to 80% (Non-patent<br>
Document 4). Thus, it is difficult to consider this technique as a technique that can<br>
be industrially implemented. As described above, a technique for producing 1,3-<br>
cyclopentanediones which has proved satisfactory in terms of industrial<br>
implementation has not yet been reported owing to the difficulty in synthesizing 1,3-<br>
cyclopentanediones.<br>
[0011]<br>
On the other hand, a γ-ketoester is a useful compound for organic synthesis<br>
and is also useful as a precursor for producing a substituted cyclopentanone<br>
according to the present invention. However, it is difficult to synthesize a γ-<br><br>
ketoester in a small number of steps because it has two types of highly reactive<br>
functional groups, that is, ketone and ester in the same molecule. As an example of<br>
a few efficient synthetic processes, it is already known that a γ-ketoester can be<br>
synthesized at a stroke by treating furfuryl alcohol with hydrogen chloride in an<br>
alcohol. For example, Non-patent Document 8 discloses an example of reacting<br>
furfuryl alcohol in methanol or ethanol. However, a γ-ketoester can be obtained<br>
only in a very low yield of 29 to 36% by this technique. In other words, synthesis of<br>
a γ-ketoester with high efficiency has not yet been achieved by conventional<br>
techniques.<br>
[0012]<br>
Further, a substituted cyclopentenone represented by the following formula<br>
(15). is a useful compound as a precursor for producing a substituted cyclopentanone<br>
according to the present invention. Non-patent Document 5 is known as a process<br>
for producing this compound.<br><br>
This production process has a step in which succinic acid is reacted with an<br>
acid chloride using aluminum chloride as a catalyst and nitromethane as a solvent.<br>
However, this step has a serious problem for the industrial implementation thereof.<br>
First, the yield is as low as 50%. In addition, this step requires a large amount of<br>
aluminum chloride and an acid chloride, which are difficult in handling due to<br>
fuming properties and corrosive properties, that is, 2.4 times by mole and 4 times by<br>
mole, respectively, relative to the amount of succinic acid as a raw material. This is<br>
not only the problem of production such as a difficulty in operation at the time of<br><br>
charging these compounds and corrosion of reactor materials but also the problem of<br>
environmental protection in that a large amount of aluminum-based and chloride-<br>
based wastes are discharged after reaction. Moreover, there is also a problem that<br>
since nitromethane which is used as a solvent is an explosive substance, a particular<br>
safety measure is required for using the same in an industrial scale. As described<br>
above, in conventional techniques, there is no process for safely and efficiently<br>
producing a substituted cyclopentenone represented by the above formula (15) in an<br>
industrial scale.<br>
[0014]<br>
A 1,3-cyclopentanediones having a structure with a trans-double bond in a<br>
side chain, represented by the following formula (17), is a useful compound as an<br>
intermediate for producing a substituted cyclopentanone according to the present<br>
invention.<br><br>
For synthesizing this compound by conventional techniques, there can be<br>
mentioned, for example, a process in which a halide having an allyl group in which<br>
the double bond is in trans configuration, represented by the following formula (40):<br><br>
(wherein R represents the meaning described below; and X represents a halogen<br>
atom) is allowed to react with 1,3-cyclopentanedione in the presence of a base.<br>
However, according to this process, it is necessary to stereoselectively synthesize a<br><br>
halide represented by the above formula (40) beforehand. This involved, for<br>
example, a problem that a complicated process is required such that the triple bond of<br>
a compound represented by the following formula (41):<br><br>
(wherein R25 represents the meaning described below) is hydrogenated with sodium<br>
in liquid ammonia, followed by conversion of the alcohol to halogen. In other<br>
words, simple production of a 1,3-cyclopentanedione having a trans-double bond in a<br>
side chain, represented by the above formula (17), has not yet been achieved by<br>
conventional techniques.<br>
[0018]<br>
If the trans-double bond in the side chain of a compound represented by the<br>
following formula (18) could be selectively converted to an oxirane (epoxidation) to<br>
synthesize a compound represented by the following formula (19), the double bond<br>
in the side chain would be protected. Furthermore, if the oxirane ring could be<br>
converted to a diol by its cleavage to the anti-type, the technique may provide a clue<br>
to the introduction of a cis-double bond. This could be very useful for the synthesis<br>
of a substituted cyclopentanone such as a jasmine fragrance. However, such a<br>
technique has not yet been disclosed.<br>
[0019]<br><br><br><br>
Methylcyclopentenones such as cis-jasmone and dihydrojasmone occupy an<br>
important position among jasmine fragrances, and a large number of production<br>
processes have been reported. Many of these processes are based on an<br>
intramolecular aldol reaction of a 1,4-diketone. For example, a large number of<br>
examples such as Patent Documents 5 and 6 and Non-patent Document 9 are known.<br>
According to these processes, specific methylcyclopentenones can be produced.<br>
However, since these processes are uniquely specialized in the production of these<br>
specific methylcyclopentenones, it is difficult to produce other useful fragrances by<br>
using these processes. In the fragrance industry, it is indispensable that many types<br>
of fragrance can be produced freely, and a production process specialized in one<br>
fragrance material as described above is very inefficient. For example, it is<br>
practically impossible to derivatively obtain jasmonates which are especially useful<br>
and have a large demand in jasmine fragrance by using these processes, and a totally<br>
different production process must be adopted to produce these esters. Therefore,<br>
there was a difficulty in that unreasonableness and disadvantageousness arise in<br>
supply of production equipment and raw materials and the like. In other words,<br>
conventional techniques have not yet achieved derivative production of jasmonates<br>
and methylcyclopentenones, both of which occupy important positions in the field of<br>
jasmine fragrance, through the same synthetic route.<br>
[0021]<br>
There are many reports on the production process of γ-lactones, and many of<br>
them are on the production of γ-lactones from an alcohol and an acrylic acid<br>
derivative by radical addition with an organic peroxide and the like. For example,<br><br>
there is known a process in which an acrylic acid derivative is allowed to react with<br>
an alcohol in the presence of di-t-butyl peroxide and zinc halide (Patent Document 7).<br>
However, γ-lactones produced by this process generally had a serious drawback in<br>
that they had a plastic-like flavor and sourness and their original good fruity or floral<br>
fragrance was impaired. Various purification processes to improve such a drawback<br>
had been disclosed, but none of them was perfect. Further, there was also a<br>
difficulty in that an organic peroxide such as di-t-butyl peroxide was a dangerous<br>
substance having explosiveness and required special measures for the handling<br>
thereof. Thus, development of a fundamentally different production process of γ-<br>
lactones has been strongly desired.<br>

[0066]<br>
The present invention makes it possible to provide a process for highly<br>
stereoselectively and industrially advantageously producing a cis-2,3-disubstituted<br>
cyclopentanone useful as a jasmine fragrance, an intermediate thereof or the like.<br>
The present invention also makes it possible to industrially advantageously provide a<br>

Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
[0067]<br><br>
The present invention will be specifically described below.<br>
[0068]<br><a first invention><br>
A first aspect of the present invention is a process for producing a substituted<br>
cyclopentanone represented by the formula (2) by hydrogenating the double bond in ,<br>
a five-membered ring of a substituted cyclopentenone represented by the formula (1)<br>
in the presence of a transition metal catalyst by using a carboxylic acid or a specific<br>
concentration of a carboxylic acid ester as a solvent.<br>
[0069]<br>
In the hydrogenation of a compound represented by the above formula (1), it<br>
is an essential requirement to use a carboxylic acid and/or a carboxylic acid ester as a<br>
solvent to perform hydrogenation. A desired cis-2,3-substituted-<br>
alkoxycarbonylmethylcyclopentanone can be obtained with high selectivity by<br>
meeting this requirement.<br>
[0070]<br>
Ketones are known to undergo enolization under acidic conditions (for<br>
example, Morrison Boyd "Organic Chemistry" (2nd Volume), 5th Edition, p. 1,139).<br>
A 2,3-substituted cyclopentanone is also expected to undergo enolization under<br>
acidic conditions. Specifically, it was expected that even if the cis isomer was<br>
formed, the configuration on the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group was inverted,<br>
and it isomerized to the thermodynamically stable trans-isomer (Figure 1). However,<br>
as a result of the present inventors' experiment, a surprising fact was found that the<br>
selectivity of the cis-isomer was higher in the case where hydrogenation was<br>
performed using carboxylic acid as a solvent than the case where a neutral substance<br>
such as methanol was used as a solvent. This fact is contrary to the common sense<br>
of organic chemistry, and a person skilled in the art cannot predict it easily.<br>
[0071]<br><br>
In the above formula (1), R1 and R2 represent a linear or branched alkyl group,<br>
alkenyl group, or alkynyl group having 1 to 8 carbon atoms, and these groups may<br>
also contain heteroatoms, such as chlorine, bromine, nitrogen, oxygen, sulfur, iron,<br>
and cobalt. Specific examples of R1 and R2 include a methyl group, an ethyl group,<br>
a butyl group, and a pentyl group, hexyl group as an alkyl group; a pentenyl group as<br>
an alkenyl group; and a pentynyl group as an alkynyl group. A pentenyl group<br>
includes a cis-2-pentenyl group and a 5-hydroxy-cis-2-pentenyl group, and a<br>
pentynyl group includes a 2-pentynyl group and a 5-hydroxy-2-pentynyl group.<br>
When the application to a jasmine fragrance is taken into consideration, a pentyl<br>
group is suitable, and a cis-2-pentenyl group, 2-pentynyl group, a 5-hydroxy-cis-2-<br>
pentenyl group, a 5-hydroxy-2-pentynyl group, and the like are also suitable. R1 and<br>
R2 may be the same as each other.<br>
[0072]<br>
In the above formula (2), R and R represent a linear or branched alkyl group,<br>
alkenyl group, or alkynyl group having 1 to 8 carbon atoms, and these groups may<br>
also contain heteroatoms, such as chlorine, bromine, nitrogen, oxygen, sulfur, iron,<br>
and cobalt. Specific examples of R and R include a methyl group, an ethyl group,<br>
a butyl group, a pentyl group, and a hexyl group as an alkyl group; a pentenyl group<br>
as an alkenyl group; and a pentynyl group as an alkynyl group. A pentenyl group<br>
includes a cis-2-pentenyl group and a 5-hydroxy-cis-2-pentenyl group, and a<br>
pentynyl group includes a 2-pentynyl group and a 5-hydroxy-2-pentynyl group.<br>
When the application to a jasmine fragrance is taken into consideration, a pentyl<br>
group is suitable, and a cis-2-pentenyl group, a 2-pentynyl group, a 5-hydroxy-cis-2-<br>
pentenyl group, a 5-hydroxy-2-pentynyl group, and the like are also suitable. R and<br>
R4 may be the same as R1 and R , respectively, respectively. R3 and R4 may be the<br>
same as each other.<br><br>
A general-purpose carboxylic acid may be used for the above carboxylic acid.<br>
Examples of the carboxylic acid include a carboxylic acid which is liquid at ordinary<br>
temperatures such as acetic acid, propionic acid, butyric acid, malonic acid, as well<br>
as a liquid prepared by mixing a carboxylic acid which is solid at ordinary<br>
temperatures such as succinic acid, citric acid, malic acid, lactic acid, and gluconic<br>
acid with a liquid such as water. Among others, lactic acid is preferred in that the<br>
yield of a compound of the formula (2) is high, and a larger amount of the cis-isomer<br>
can be produced.<br>
[0073]<br>
A general-purpose carboxylic acid ester may be used for the above carboxylic<br>
acid ester. Examples of the carboxylic acid ester include a methyl ester, an ethyl<br>
ester, a propyl ester, and a butyl ester of the above carboxylic acid. Among others,<br>
acetic acid ester is preferred in that the yield of a compound of the formula (2) is<br>
high, and a larger amount of the cis-isomer can be produced. Moreover, when a<br>
carboxylic acid is compared with a carboxylic acid ester, a carboxylic acid is more<br>
preferred because it provides a higher yield of a compound of the formula (2).<br>
[0074]<br>
A carboxylic acid and/or a carboxylic acid ester only may be used, or a mixed<br>
solvent thereof with other solvent(s) (such as alcohols, ethers, and hydrocarbons)<br>
may be used, as a solvent for the hydrogenation of the compound of the above<br>
formula (1).<br>
[0075]<br>
In the reaction solution at the start of hydrogenation, the amount of a<br>
carboxylic acid and/or a carboxylic acid ester used as a solvent for the hydrogenation<br>
of a compound of the above formula (1) is preferably 0.05 parts by weight and less<br>
than 1,000 parts by weight, more preferably 0.1 part by weight or more and less than<br>
500 parts by weight, most preferably 1 part by weight or more and less than 200 parts<br><br>
by weight, based on one part by weight of the compound represented by the above<br>
formula (1), because the reaction rate and the cis-isomer ratio can be maintained.<br>
[0076]<br>
A general-purpose transition metal catalyst can be used as the above transition<br>
metal catalyst. Examples of a heterogeneous catalyst include palladium, rhodium,<br>
ruthenium, Raney, platinum and nickel, including Pd-carbon, Rh-carbon and Ru-<br>
carbon as a carbon-loaded catalyst; Pd-Al2O3, Rh-Al2O3 and R11-Al2O3 as an<br>
inorganic substance-loaded catalyst; PtO2 as an oxide-based catalyst; Pt as a metal-<br>
based catalyst; Raney Ni as an alloγ-based catalyst; and silk-Pd as a protein-loaded<br>
catalyst. Further, examples of a homogeneous catalyst include a Wilkinson complex<br>
(RhCl(PPh3)3). A heterogeneous catalyst is preferred in terms of the ease of<br>
separation after a reaction, and palladium is most effective of all. Among others, a<br>
carbon-loaded catalyst is preferred, most preferably Pd-carbon. Activated carbon is<br>
also included in the carbon of a carbon-loaded catalyst. The amount of the catalyst<br>
to be used is, for example, preferably from 0.01 to 100 parts by weight based on one<br>
part by weight of the compound represented by the formula (1). In the carbon-<br>
loaded catalyst and inorganic substance-loaded catalyst of a heterogeneous catalyst,<br>
the amount of a transition metal to be deposited is not limited, and it is preferably<br>
from 0.1 to 50 wt%, most preferably from 1 to 20 wt%.<br>
[0077]<br>
Although the aforementioned hydrogenation advances easily by introducing<br>
hydrogen into a reaction vessel under ordinary pressure, it is also possible to carry<br>
out the hydrogenation, for example, under a pressurization of about 1 to 10 kg/cm2<br>
for the purpose of a further increase in the reaction rate or the like.<br>
[0078]<br><br>
The reaction temperature in the aforementioned hydrogenation is not limited,<br>
and it is preferably from -30°C to 100°C, more preferably from -10 to 50°C from a<br>
practical point of view.<br>
[0079]<br>
In performing the aforementioned hydrogenation, all the essential ingredients<br>
other than the compound of the formula (1) which is a substrate are substantially a<br>
catalyst, a solvent, and hydrogen, and a third component as conventionally needed in<br>
order to affect catalytic activity, specifically, to increase the yield of a compound of<br>
the formula (2) or to increase the cis-isomer ratio in the compound of the formula (2)<br>
is unnecessary. In particular, it is not necessary to add a third component which is<br>
soluble in a solvent. Examples of such a third component include co-catalysts such<br>
as an aluminum alcoholate, a phosphate, an acetate, and a bidentate diphosphine<br>
ligand. Therefore, a compound of the formula (2) and a catalyst can be separated<br>
easily only by filtering out the catalyst after the end of the reaction, and the catalyst<br>
can also be reused as it is. This is a great advantage when producing a compound of<br>
the formula (2) industrially and is a great progress over prior art. When adding such<br>
a third component for another purpose, a very small amount such as from 0.01 to 0.5<br>
time by mole may be added without affecting the reaction system. Note that the<br>
above third component does not include a substance which is easily filtered from a<br>
a<br>
compound of the formula (2), a solvent, or a substance which does not substantially<br>
affect the isomer ratio or the yield of a compound of the formula (1) or a compound<br>
of the formula (2). Such a substance can be added in the range of 0.0.1 to twice by<br>
mole based on the catalyst according to the purpose.<br>
[0080]<br>
After the completion of hydrogenation reaction, the target compound of the<br>
formula (2) can be obtained by filtering a catalyst and purifying the compound by a<br>
known process.<br><br>
[0081]<br></a><a second invention><br>
A second aspect of the present invention is a process of producing a 1,3-<br>
cyclopentanedione by heating a compound of the above formula (3) and a base in an<br>
aprotic polar solvent to thereby cyclize the compound. In the aforementioned<br>
production process, it is an essential requirement to react a compound of the formula<br>
(3) with a basic substance in a solvent containing an aprotic polar solvent in an<br>
amount of 10 wt% or more and 100 wt% or less. By satisfying this requirement, a<br>
1,3-cyclopentanedione can be obtained in a high yield.<br>
A 1,3-cyclopentanedione represented by the formula (4) obtained in the<br>
present invention can be used also as a precursor for producing the above compound<br>
of the formula (2). By satisfying the requirements for the present invention, the 1,3-<br>
cyclopentanedione can be obtained in a high yield.<br>
[0082]<br>
In the above formula (3), R5 represents a hydrogen atom or a linear, branched,<br>
or cyclic alkyl group, alkenyl group, or alkynyl group having 1 to 8 carbon atoms.<br>
Specific examples of R5 include a methyl group, an ethyl group, a butyl group, a<br>
pentyl group, and a hexyl group as an alkyl group; a pentenyl group as an alkenyl<br>
group; and a pentynyl group as an alkynyl group. A pentenyl group includes a cis-<br>
2-pentenyl group and a 5-hydroxy-cis-2-pentenyl group, and a pentynyl group<br>
includes a 2-pentynyl group and a 5-hydroxy-2-pentynyl group. When the<br>
application to a jasmine fragrance is taken into consideration, a pentyl group is<br>
suitable, and a cis-2-pentenyl group, a 2-pentynyl group, and the like are also<br>
suitable.<br>
[0083]<br>
In the above formula (3), R represents a linear, branched, or cyclic alkyl<br>

t-butyl group, an n-pentyl group, an n-hexyl group; an n-heptyl group, an n-octyl<br>
group, a cyclohexyl group, and a benzyl group as an alkyl group; an allyl group and a<br>
methallyl group as an alkenyl group. When ease in distilling off, safety, cost, etc. in<br>
the treatment after reaction are taken into consideration, an alkyl group is preferred;<br>
and among others, an n-propyl group, an isopropyl group, an n-butyl group, an<br><br>
isobutyl group, and a t-butyl group are preferred, most preferably an n-butyl group<br>
and an isobutyl group.<br>
[0275]<br>
In the above formula (38), R59 represents a hydrogen atom or a linear or<br>
branched alkyl group, alkenyl group, or alkynyl group having 1 to 12 carbon atoms,<br>
and these groups may contain heteroatoms such as chlorine, bromine, nitrogen,<br>
oxygen, sulfur, iron, and cobalt. Specific examples of R59 include a methyl group,<br>
an ethyl group, a butyl group, a pentyl group, a hexyl group, a heptyl group, an octyl<br>
group, and a nonyl group as an alkyl group; a pentenyl group as an alkenyl group;<br>
and a pentynyl group as an alkynyl group. A pentenyl group includes a cis-2-<br>
pentenyl group and a 5-hydroxy-cis-2-pentenyl group, and a pentynyl group includes<br>
a 2-pentynyl group and a 5-hydroxy-2-pentynyl group. When the application to a<br>
jasmine fragrance is taken into consideration, a pentyl group is suitable, and a cis-2-<br>
pentenyl group, 2-pentynyl group, a 5-hydroxy-cis-2-pentenyl group, a 5-hydroxy-2-<br>
pentynyl group, and the like are also suitable. R59 may be the same as R57.<br>
[0276]<br>
In the above formula (38), R60 represents a linear, branched or cyclic alkyl<br>
group, alkenyl group, or alkynyl group having 1 to 8 carbon atoms. Specific<br>
examples of R60 include a methyl group, an ethyl group, an n-propyl group, an<br>
isopropyl group, an n-butyl group, an isobutyl group, a t-butyl group, an n-pentyl<br>
group, an n-hexyl group, an n-heptyl group, an n-octyl group, a cyclohexyl group,<br>
and a benzyl group as an alkyl group; an allyl group and a methallyl group as an<br>
alkenyl group. An alkyl group is preferred, and most preferred is a methyl group or<br>
an ethyl group. R60 may be the same as R58, and R59 and R60 may be the same as<br>
each other.<br>
A compound of the above formula (36) can be synthesized by a known<br>
process.<br><br>
[0277]<br>
The alcohol represented by the above formula (37) is preferably used in an<br>
equimolar amount or more and in an amount of 100 times by mole or less, more<br>
preferably in an amount of 1.5 times by mole or more and 80 times by mole or less,<br>
based on a furfuryl alcohol represented by the formula (36).<br>
[0278]<br>
In the reaction liquid used for the aforementioned production process,<br>
although other components, such as methanol, ethanol, ether, tetrahydrofuran,<br>
toluene, and xylene, may be present in addition to the alcohol of the formula (37), the<br>
percentage may be from about 0.01 wt% to 50 wt% of the reaction liquid.<br>
[0279]<br>
The process of supplying hydrogen chloride into a reaction liquid includes a<br>
process of blowing hydrogen chloride gas; a process of adding hydrochloric acid (an<br>
aqueous solution of hydrogen chloride); and a process of adding an acyl chloride<br>
compound such as acetyl chloride and allowing it to react with an alcohol of the<br>
above formula (37) or the like, thereby generating hydrogen chloride in the reaction<br>
system; and the like. Among these, more desirable result is obtained in many cases<br>
when the process of blowing hydrogen chloride gas is taken.<br>
[0280]<br>
Hydrogen chloride is used in an amount of from 0.01 mole to 5 moles based<br>
on 1.0 mole of a furfuryl alcohol of the above formula (36), more preferably from<br>
0.01 mole to 2 moles.<br>
[0281]<br>
The above heating temperature is from 30 to 150°C, more preferably from 40<br>
to 120°C, most preferably from 50 to 100°C, when a practical reaction rate to be<br>
obtained is taken into consideration.<br>
[0282]<br><br>
Furthermore, when a furfuryl alcohol of the above formula (36) is added<br>
dropwise to the mixture of an alcohol of the above formula (37) with hydrogen<br>
chloride, a γ-ketoester can be obtained in a high yield in many cases. In this case, a<br>
solution prepared by diluting the compound of the above formula (36) with the<br>
alcohol of the above formula (37) or other solvents, etc. beforehand may be added<br>
dropwise. Concentration of the solution is, for example, from 0.01 mol/1 to 10 mol/1.<br>
The time of dropwise addition is, but is not limited to, preferably from 10 minutes to<br>
5 hours, most preferably from 30 minutes to 3 hours.<br>
[0283]<br>
After the completion of the above-mentioned reaction, the target γ-ketoester<br>
of the formula (38) can be obtained by performing purification in a known manner.<br>
[0284]<br>
[The second step]<br>
Next, a γ-ketoester represented by the above formula (38) is reduced to<br>
produce a γ-lactone of the above formula (39). Specifically, it can be achieved by<br>
reducing the ketone of γ-ketoester to form a hydroxyl group.<br>
[0285]<br>
In the above formula (39), R61 represents a hydrogen atom or a linear or<br>
branched alkyl group, alkenyl group, or alkynyl group having 1 to 12 carbon atoms,<br>
and these groups may contain heteroatoms such as chlorine, bromine, nitrogen,<br>
oxygen, sulfur, iron, and cobalt. Specific examples of R61 include a methyl group,<br>
an ethyl group, a butyl group, a pentyl group, a hexyl group, a heptyl group, an octyl<br>
group, and a nonyl group as an alkyl group; a pentenyl group as an alkenyl group;<br>
and a pentynyl group as an alkynyl group. A pentenyl group includes a cis-2-<br>
pentenyl group and a 5-hydroxy-cis-2-pentenyl group, and a pentynyl group includes<br>
a 2-pentynyl group and a 5-hydroxy-2-pentynyl group. When the application to a<br>
jasmine fragrance is taken into consideration, a pentyl group is suitable, and a cis-2-<br><br>
pentenyl group, 2-pentynyl group, a 5-hydroxy-cis-2-pentenyl group, a 5-hydroxy-2-<br>
pentynyl group, and the like are also suitable. R61 may be the same as R59 .<br>
[0286]<br>
The process of reducing the ketone of a γ-ketoester represented by the above<br>
formula (38) may be in accordance with a known process. Examples of the process<br>
include a process in which a hydride such as sodium borohydride is used; and<br>
hydrogenation using a transition metal catalyst. Among others, the former is<br>
desirable due to the simplicity of operation. The amount of sodium borohydride is<br>
preferably from 0.25 to 10 times by mole, most preferably from 0.5 to 5 times by<br>
mole, based on the ketoester.<br>
[0287]<br>
When the ketonic group of a γ-ketoester is reduced, a 4-hydroxy ester is<br>
produced, but at the same time a five-membered ring is formed very often to produce<br>
a γ-lactone. A known cyclization using an acid catalyst or the like may be applied<br>
when the five-membered-ring formation is imperfect.<br>
[0288]<br>
For example, there may be added an acid catalyst in an amount of 0.01 to 10<br>
times by mole based on the hydroxy ester and heated at 50 to 100°C. Examples of<br>
the acid catalyst include hydrogen chloride, sulfuric acid, and phosphoric acid as a<br>
mineral acid; p-toluenesulfonic acid as an organic acid; and titanium tetrachloride as<br>
a metal-based catalyst, and p-toluenesulfonic acid is preferred in terms of yield and<br>
cost.<br>
[0289]<br>
By the way, it is known that an optically active γ-lactone has a great<br>
advantage in scent intensity and fragrance characteristics. If asymmetrical<br>
hydrogenation can be achieved in this process, great added value can be provided to<br>
a product. For asymmetrical hydrogenation, it is effective to use a transition metal<br><br>
catalyst having an asymmetric ligand and a biocatalyst such as baker's yeast, an<br>
enzyme, and the like. Thus, it is also one of the great features of the present<br>
invention that an optically active substance can be produced.<br>
[0290]<br>
After the completion of the above reaction, the target γ-lactone of the formula<br>
(39) can be obtained by purification using a known process.<br>

To a reactor (a volume of 50 ml) was respectively charged lg (4.5 mmol) of<br>
methyl (2-pentyl-3-keto-l-cyclopentenyl-)acetate (a compound in which R1<br>
represents an n-pentyl group and R2 represents a methyl group in the above formula<br>
(1)) and 0.2g of each catalyst shown in Table 1. Thereto was respectively added 10<br>
ml of a solvent shown in Table 1, and the mixture was held at a temperature shown<br>
in Table 1. Pressure reduction and hydrogen introduction were repeated while<br>
stirring the mixture, and the air in the reactor was replaced with hydrogen at ordinary<br>
pressure. The mixture was continuously stirred in this state for 4 hours.<br>
Subsequently, the catalyst was removed from the reaction mixture by filtration, and<br>
then thereto were added 30 ml of water and 30 ml of toluene followed by stirring to<br>
extract a product into the toluene phase. Toluene was distilled off from this toluene<br>
phase, yielding methyl dihydrojasmonate (a compound in which R3 represents an n-<br>
pentyl group and R4 represents a methyl group in the above formula (2)). The yield<br>
and isomer ratio (cis-isomer/trans-isomer) of the resulting methyl dihydrojasmonate<br>
were determined by gas chromatography. The results are shown in Table 1.<br><br><br><br>
Example 8<br>

replaced with nitrogen gas at ordinary pressure, and 22.7 g (0.42 mol) of sodium<br>
methoxide and 3 L of dimethyl sulfoxide were charged to the reactor. The resulting<br>
solution was heated to about 90°C, and the inside of the reactor was decompressed to<br>
about 25 mmHg with stirring. While allowing dimethyl sulfoxide to be distilled off<br>
from the reactor at a rate of 12 mL/min in this state, 42.0 g (0.21 mol) of methyl 4-<br>
oxodecanoate (a compound in which R5 represents an n-pentyl group, and R6<br>
represents a methyl group in the above formula (3)) preliminarily dissolved in 1.5 L<br>

[0293]<br>
After completion of the dropwise addition, the pressure in the reactor was<br>
increased to about 15 mmHg; subsequently dimethyl sulfoxide was distilled off; and<br>
then the resulting reaction mixture was cooled to about 40°C. Thereto were added 1<br>
L of water, 46 g of concentrated hydrochloric acid and 0.8 L of isobutyl alcohol.<br>
The resulting mixture was stirred and then allowed to stand, and the resulting organic<br>
phase was separated. Liquid chromatographic analysis of this organic phase showed<br>
that 2-n-pentyl-1,3-cyclopentanedione (a compound in which R7 represents an n-<br>
pentyl group in the above formula (4)) was produced, and the yield was 92%.<br>
Example 9<br>

mixture was stirred for further 20 minutes under heating at the same temperature.<br>
The mixture was cooled to 25°C, and then thereto were added 100 g of water and 8.0<br>
g of concentrated hydrochloric acid followed by stirring. Liquid chromatographic<br>
analysis of the reaction mixture showed that 2-n-pentyl-l,3-cyclopentanedione (a<br>
compound in which R7 represents an n-pentyl group in the above formula (4)) was<br>
produced, and the yield was 86%.<br>

distilling off toluene in vacuo, the resulting mixture was cooled to 25°C, and thereto<br>

Example 11<br>
The air in a reactor (a volume of 2 L) was replaced with nitrogen gas at<br>
ordinary pressure, and 1.1 L of isobutanol containing 0.7 wt% of hydrogen chloride<br>
(prepared by preliminarily blowing hydrogen chloride therein) was charged to the<br>
reactor. The hydrogen chloride solution was heated to 80°C and stirred, and then<br>
thereto was added dropwise 264 g (1.57 mol) of n-pentyl-furylcarbinol (a compound<br>
in which R8 represents an n-pentyl group in the above formula (5)) over 3 hours.<br>
After completion of the dropwise addition, the mixture was stirred for further 10<br>
minutes at the same temperature. Isobutanol was distilled off in vacuo, and the<br>

[0300]<br><br>
The air in a reactor (a volume of 0.3 L) was preliminarily replaced with<br>
nitrogen at ordinary pressure. The reactor was charged with 13.5 g (70 mmol) of a<br>

Thereto was added 6.6 g (50 mmol) of dimethyl malonate, and the mixture was<br>
stirred for 30 minutes at 25°C. Thereto was added 6.6 g (36 mmol) of 2-pentyl-3-<br>
methoxy-2-cyclopentenone, and the mixture was heated under reflux for 24 hours in<br>
a nitrogen atmosphere. The resulting mixture was ice-cooled and neutralized by<br>
gradually adding 6.1 ml of concentrated hydrochloric acid, and methanol was<br>

nitromethane (30 ml) in a container having a volume of 0.1 L was added 12 g (0.1<br>
mol) of 25°C succinic acid in small quantities, and the mixture was stirred at 25°C.<br>
Highly corrosive HC1 gas was generated violently, and the gas was removed with<br>
difficulty. In addition, since AlCl3 is fuming (HC1 gas), measures were taken<br>
against corrosion of equipment in the peripheral environment at the time of weighing,<br>
but it was with difficulty. Moreover, since nitromethane, which is a solvent, is<br>
explosive, it was handled while paying careful attention within explosion prevention<br>
equipment.<br><br>
[0301]<br>
After charging succinic acid, the mixture was allowed stand to complete<br>
generation of HC1 gas. Then, thereto was added 60g (0.4 mol) of heptanoyl chloride,<br>
and the resulting mixture was heated at 80□ for 8 hours. Since heptanoyl chloride<br>
is also fuming (HC1 gas), measures were taken against corrosion of equipment in the<br>
peripheral environment at the time of weighing, but it was with difficulty. The<br>
mixture was cooled, poured onto 60 g of ice, and maintained at -10°C for 10 hours,<br>
depositing a product as a solid. The product was subjected to suction filtration,<br>
washed with 10% NaCl water and toluene (20 ml x 3 times), and dried, yielding 8.4g<br>
(0.05 mol) of 2-pentyl-l,3-cyclopentanedione (a compound in which R1 represents<br>
an n-pentyl group in the above formula (3)). Yields were 20.8%, 50.0%, and 12.5%<br>
relative to AlCl3, succinic acid, and heptanoyl chloride, respectively.<br>
Simultaneously, wastewater containing a large amount of an aluminum-based and a<br>
chlorine-based compound was byproduced.<br>

toluenesulfonic acid were mixed with 500 ml of toluene, and the mixture was heated<br>
under reflux for 4 hours. During the reflux, byproduced water was azeotropically<br>
removed out of the system. Then, the mixture was mixed with a saturated water<br>
solution of sodium hydrogencarbonate and allowed to stand to separate the resulting<br>
organic phase. Toluene in the organic phase was distilled off in vacuo, yielding a<br>

In 100 ml of a non-aqueous methanol containing 1% of hydrogen chloride<br>
was dissolved 5.0 g of the compound, and the mixture was heated under reflux for 4<br>
hours. Sodium hydrogencarbonate was added to the mixture to neutralize hydrogen<br>
chloride, and then methanol was distilled off in vacuo. Subsequently, thereto was<br>
added 50 ml of water and 250 ml of isobutanol, and then the mixture was allowed to<br>
stand to separate the organic phase. Isobutanol in the organic phase was distilled off<br>
in vacuo, yielding a compound in which R34 represents an ethyl group, and R35<br>
represents a methyl group in the above formula (23) (yield: 86%).<br>

0.59 g of sodium methoxide, and 5 ml of non-aqueous methanol were mixed for 15<br>
minutes at 25°C. The non-aqueous methanol solution of the formula (23) was added<br>
to the above solution, and the mixture was heated under reflux for 22 hours.<br>
Thereto was added 1 N hydrochloric acid and diethyl ether, followed by mixing and<br>
phase separation, and the organic phase was separated. The solvent in the organic<br>
phase was distilled off in vacuo, yielding a compound in which R36 represents an<br>
ethyl group, and R37 represents a methyl group in the above formula (24) (yield:<br>
91%).<br>
[0305]<br>
In 100 ml of dichloromethane was dissolved 1.0 g of the compound, and 1.08<br>
g of m-chloroperbenzoic acid was added thereto under ice-cooling and then stirred at<br>
25°C for 4 hours. The mixture was mixed with 8 ml of 1 N sodium thiosulfate and 2<br><br><br>

dissolved 0.7 g of the compound, and then 1.1 g of 70% aqueous perchloric acid<br>
solution was added thereto and stirred at 25°C for 1 hour. The mixture was<br>
neutralized with sodium hydrogencarbonate, and then tetrahydrofuran was distilled<br>
off in vacuo. Ethyl acetate was added thereto and then mixed, followed by allowing<br>
the mixture to stand, and the resulting organic phase was separated. Ethyl acetate in<br>
the organic phase was distilled off in vacuo, yielding a compound in which R40<br>
represents an ethyl group, and R41 represents a methyl group in the above formula<br>
(26) (yield: 82%).<br>

To a reactor were charged 0.5 g of the compound and 0.1 g of palladium-<br>
activated carbon (palladium content: 10%&gt;). Thereto was added 5 ml of ethyl acetate,<br>
and pressure reduction and hydrogen introduction were repeated with stirring to<br>
replace the air inside the reactor with hydrogen at ordinary pressure. In this state,<br>
the mixture was stirred for 6 hours. After removing the catalyst from the reaction<br>
mixture by filtration, ethyl acetate was distilled off in vacuo, yielding a compound in<br>
which R42 represents ethyl and R43 represents methyl in the above formula (27)<br>

mixture was added dropwise over 1 hour to 5 ml of acetic anhydride which was<br>
preliminarily heated under reflux. The mixture was heated under reflux for 20<br>
minutes, and then acetic anhydride was distilled off in vacuo. To the mixture were<br>
added a saturated aqueous solution of sodium hydrogencarbonate and diethyl ether,<br>
followed by stirring the mixture and allowing it to stand, and the resulting organic<br>
phase was separated. The solvent of the organic phase was distilled off, yielding a<br>
2,3-disubstituted cyclopentanone in which R46 represents ethyl and R47 represents<br>
methyl in the above formula (29) (yield: 88%). The ratio of the configuration of the<br>
substituents at 2- and 3-positions of the compound was as follows:<br>
cis-isomer : trans-isomer = 55 : 45.<br>
Example 15<br>
In a reactor with a volume of 0.1 L, 4.0 g of 1,3-cyclopentanedione, 6.0 g of<br>
potassium carbonate, and 6.6 g of l-bromo-2-pentyne were added to 40 ml of water,<br>
and the mixture was heated at 60°C for 6 hours. After adding 2 g of 5N sodium<br>
hydroxide and 30 ml of toluene followed by stirring at 25°C, the mixture was phase-<br>
separated and the aqueous phase was separated. Hydrochloric acid was added to the<br>
aqueous phase, and it was adjusted to pH=l. The aqueous phase was extracted<br>

compound in which R49 represents an ethyl group and a bond is present in the dotted<br><br>
line part in the above formula (31) (yield: 40%). In 20 ml of anhydrous methanol<br>
containing 1% of hydrogen chloride was dissolved 2.0 g of the compound, and the<br>
mixture was heated under reflux for 5 hours. After hydrogen chloride was<br>
neutralized with sodium hydrogencarbonate, methanol was distilled off in vacuo.<br>
After adding 20 ml of water and 20 ml of toluene, the mixture was phase-separated<br>
and the organic phase was separated. The toluene in the organic phase was distilled<br>
off in vacuo, yielding a compound in which R50 represents an ethyl group and R51<br>
represents a methyl group in the above formula (32) (yield: 83%). A solution<br>

pentyl group and R55 represents a methyl group in the above formula (34)), 0.5 g (8.5<br>
mmol) of sodium chloride, 0.2 g of water, and 3 ml of dimethyl sulfoxide was heated<br>
at 160°C under nitrogen atmosphere for 3 hours. The mixture was cooled to 25°C,<br>
and then 10 ml of water and 20 ml of ethyl acetate were added thereto followed by<br>
stirring to thereby extract the product into the ethyl acetate phase. Gas<br><br>
chromatographic analysis showed that the yield of 2-n-pentyl-3-methyl-2-<br>
cyclopentenone was 82%.<br>
Comparative Example 12<br>

[CH3COCH2CH2COCH2(CH2)4CH3], 7 ml of ethanol, and 25 ml of 0.5N sodium<br>
hydroxide were mixed, and the mixture was heated under reflux under nitrogen<br>
atmosphere for 5 hours. The mixture was cooled to 25°C, and then 20 ml of diethyl<br>
ether was added thereto followed by stirring to thereby extract the product into the<br>
diethyl ether phase. Gas chromatographic analysis showed that the yield of 2-n-<br>

gas at ordinary pressure, was charged 1.1 L of isobutanol containing 0.7 wt% of<br>
hydrogen chloride (prepared by preliminarily blowing hydrogen chloride therein).<br>
The hydrogen chloride solution was heated to 80°C and stirred, and thereto was<br>
added dropwise 264 g (1.57 mol) of n-pentyl-furylcarbinol (a compound in which<br>
R57 represents an n-pentyl group in the above formula (36)) over 3 hours.<br>
[0311]<br>
After completion of the dropwise addition, the mixture was stirred for further<br>
10 minutes at the same temperature. Isobutanol was distilled off in vacuo, yielding<br>
isobutyl 4-oxodecanoate (a compound in which R59 represents an n-pentyl group, and<br>
R60 represents an isobutyl group in the above formula (38)). Gas chromatographic<br>
analysis showed that the yield of isobutyl 4-oxodecanoate was 88%.<br>
[0312]<br><br>
In 200 ml of 99.5% ethanol, was dissolved 24.2 g (0.10 mol) of isobutyl 4-<br>
oxodecanoate. Thereto was added 4.2 g (0.11 mol) of sodium borohydride in small<br>
quantities, and then the mixture was stirred for 10 minutes at 25°C. The solution<br>
was poured into 1 L of water, and 1 L of ethyl acetate was further added thereto<br>
followed by stirring to thereby extract the product into the ethyl acetate phase.<br>
Ethyl acetate was distilled off followed by vacuum distillation, yielding γ-<br>
decalactone (a compound in which R61 represents an n-pentyl group in the above<br>
formula (39)). Gas chromatographic analysis showed that the yield of γ-decalactone<br>
relative to isobutyl 4-oxodecanoate was 93%. In the resulting γ-decalactone, a<br>
plastic-like flavor or acid taste was not observed at all, but it had a good peach-like<br>
aroma.<br>
Comparative Example 13<br>
To an autoclave (a volume of 1 L) was charged 349 g (3.0 mol) of n-heptanol<br>
and 0.06 g (0.27 mmol) of zinc bromide. The mixture was heated and stirred at<br>
165°C. Into the mixture in this state was injected a mixed liquor of 57 g (0.66 mol)<br>
of methyl acrylate and 9.9 g (0.068 mol) of di-t-butylperoxide over 6 hours. The<br>
resulting mixture was stirred at the temperature for further 1 hour. Subsequently,<br>
unreacted n-heptanol was distilled off followed by vacuum distillation, yielding γ-<br>
decalactone. Gas chromatographic analysis showed that the yield of γ-decalactone<br>
was 69%. The resulting γ-decalactone was plastic-like in odor and acidulous, which<br>
indicated an inferior aroma.<br>
