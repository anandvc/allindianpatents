The steel wool may be prepared from the waste generated by steel plant. The steel wool is crushed and is the mixed with clean and dried river sand. Water contaminated with different forms of arsenic is kept in contact with steel wool and sand mixture, taking about 15g of Mixture per one liter of contaminated/drinking water, for o approximately 2 hours in a thermostatic shaker, at around 35 C. The treated water is then filtered through clean sand at a constant flow rate of 2..... 4 litres per hour. The various forms of arsenic are removed from water to the extent of more than 99%.</td>

				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
preparation of potable water by<br>
The present invention relates to a process for the/removal of arsenic from contaminated or drinking water.<br>
PRIOR ART<br>
Arsenic is known to cause toxicity in drinking water. The systems known in the art for removal of arsenic from water are based upon using of activated alumina or by using ceramic filters.<br>
A disadvantage of using above mentioned systems is that these systems do not remove arsenic to desired level.<br>
Another disadvantage of using above mentioned systems is that there is better removal of arsenic(V) as compared to arsenic(III), which is four times more toxic.<br>
Another process known in the art for removal of arsenic from water is by using chemically treated alumina.<br>
A disadvantage of using above process is that it leaches other harmful chemicals in the water.<br>
Another disadvantage of using above process is that it is expensive.<br>
Another arsenic removal technology uses iron and manganese oxide coated sand.<br>
The disadvantage of this technology is that it leaches undesirable manganese and iron in drinking water.<br>
Still another technology known in the art uses iron fines and silica sand for removal of arsenic from water.<br>
A disadvantage of this technology is that the arsenic removal is carried out under anaerobic conditions and so is expensive.<br>
Another disadvantage of using the above technology is that it is very complicated.<br><br>
c:&gt; mixing crushed steel wool and washed ?
the range of 7s3 to 2:3,<br>
o<br>
d)	mixing in s grinder at a temperature range of .1(3 to 45 C»<br>
e)	mixing sand and steel wool mixture with contaminated water and<br>
shaking the contents for half an hour to two hours with the pH<br>
range of 6-10,<br>
f)	allowing  the contents to settle and  the  supernatant  being<br>
filtered  through clean sand at a constant flow rate  of  2-4<br>
litres per hour.<br>
The invention will now be illustrated with a working example which is intended to foe a typical example to illustrate the working of the invention and is not intended to be taken restrict!vely to imply any limitation on the scope of the present invention.<br>
MORNING EXflWPLE<br>
For  the  preparation of 1kg batch of  steel  wool-sand  mixture,<br>
river  sand was washed thoroughly with analytical  grade  Milli-Q<br>
o water  and  dried  in  an oven at  a  temperature  of  110 C  for<br>
approximately 24 hours, till constant weight is achieved. 500 gm of steel wool was crushed in a grinder for 10 minutes and then it was mixed with 500 gm of washed and dried sand. It was mixed properly at ambient temperature in a mixer grinder for .15 minute. The final mixture so obtained was evaluated for its performance for the removal of arsenic from water in the following manner.<br><br>
15g  of the mixture prepared SB above was added to 100ml of  Ippm<br>
(parts  per  million) synthetic; solution of  different  forms  of<br>
arsenic  compounds and real contaminated ground water 
600ppb) in stoppered glass bottles. The contents were shaken  for<br>
helf  an  hour-  to  two hours on  s  thermastatic  shaker,  at  a<br>
o temperature  of  35 C. The solutions were allowed to  settle  and<br>
then filtered through 10 cjm of clean sand at a flow rate of 2-4 litres per hour. The filtered water was free from arsenic and other undesirable contaminants specially iron.<br>
EVALUATION<br>
Arsenic concentration before and after adsorption is determined by using GBC-HG-3000 atomic absorption spectrophotometer.<br>
Results of water analysis (Table Remove)<br><br>
BDL - below detectable limit, ND - not detected.<br>
It is clear from the foregoing description and the analytical data that the steel wool and sand mixture is highly effective for removal of arsenic from drinking water. It is inexpensive, easy to use and environmental friendly as the spent material can be used for other applications such as for making standard grade concrete blocks.<br>
It is to be understood that the process of the present invention is susceptible to modifications, changes and adaptations by those skilled in the art. Such modifications, changes, adaptations are intended to be within the scope of the present invention which is further set forth under the following claims:-<br><br><br>
