				<td>AQUEOUS POLYURETHANE/POLYUREA DISPERSIONS<br>
The present invention pertains to aqueous polyurethane-polyurea dispersions which are prepared by the acetone process using methyl acetate instead of ketones and are chain-extended using hydrazine and/or derivatives thereof, these dispersions having an improved stability towards thermal yellowing and a relatively low residual hydrazine/hydrazine derivative content<br>
The preparation of aqueous polyurethane-polyurea dispersions by means of the acetone process is well established, being known for example from Prog Org Coat 9(1981) 281-340 In the process a prepolymer containing isocyanate groups is prepared in solution or, after the reaction has been accomplished, is dissolved in acetone or other solvents readily removable by distillation Subsequently the prepolymer solution is dispersed in water and a chain extension reaction is earned out, using polyamines The extension reaction may take place m part or else completely pnor to dispersing Finally the solvent is distilled off<br>
With regard to the problem of thermal yellowing it is known from US 5,137,967 and DE 10 2004 002 526 that the use of hydrazine or hydrazine hydrate for the chain extension, rather than pnmary or secondary amines, leads to polyurethanes having an improved thermal yellowing stability However, we have found, especially when using relatively unreactive isocyanates and acetone as solvent, that the hydrazine concentrations in the resulting polyurethane-polyurea dispersions are unacceptable, owing to the high toxicity of hydrazine<br>
Many other non-ketomc solvents are reactive towards isocyanates (e g alcohols, carboxylic acids), objectionable from a toxicological or ecological standpoint (e g benzene, halogenated solvents), or more difficult to distil off than acetone, owing to their higher boiling point<br>
For technical reasons it is not always possible, when preparing polyurethane-polyurea dispersions, to avoid a process using solvents As a consequence of this there continues<br>
to be a need to be able to prepare, using a solvent process, aqueous polyurethane-polyurea dispersions which are stable towards thermal yellowing and have low concentrations of non-polymerically attached hydrazine or derivatives thereof<br>
It has now been found that polyurethanes with improved thermal yellowmg stability and a lower residual hydrazine/hydrazine denvative content are obtained if, when prepanng polyurethane-polyurea dispersions, in contradiction to the conventional acetone process, the solvent used is methyl acetate, and the chain extension is earned out using hydrazine or denvatives thereof, a mixture with pnmary or secondary amines being possible but not preferred<br>
The invention accordingly provides a process for prepanng aqueous polyurethane-polyorea dispersions which are stable to thermal yellowing, by reaction of polyiso-cyanates, polymenc polyols or polymenc polyamines, or both, and isocyanate-reactive hydrophilicizing compounds to form an NCO-containing prepolymer, followed by a chain extension reaction with hydrazine or denvatives thereof, or both, charactenzed in that the reaction for preparing the prepolymer or the further chain extension reaction or else both reaction steps is or are carried out m the presence of methyl acetate<br>
The process is particularly suitable if<br>
A)     first of all an NCO-containing polyurethane prepolymer is prepared by reacting<br>
Al)   polyisocyanates with<br>
A2)  polymenc polyols and/or polyamines having number-average molecular weights<br>

hydrophilicizing compounds, A5)   if desired, in plasticizers or solvents which boil above 100°C, which are non-<br>
ketonic and which are inert or only very slightly reactive towards isocyanate and<br>
hydrazine, A6)   if desired, in methyl acetate.<br>
B)	either the prepolymer obtained from step A is dissolved in a solvent A5) and/or A6) or, if the preparation has already been earned out in the presence of A5) and/or A6), the prepolymer solution is, where appropnate, diluted by further addition of solvents A5) and/or A6), and<br>

Typically, in step A) of the process, the constituents A2) to A4) and the polyisocyanate component Al) for the preparation of a polyurethane prepolymer, are included in whole or in part in an initial charge, which if desired is diluted with a solvent A5) and/or A6) and is heated to relatively high temperatures, preferably in the range from 50 to 120°C<br>
In the process of the invention it is additionally possible to include in the initial charge, or to meter in later on, the catalysts that are known for accelerating the isocyanate addition reaction, such as triethylamine, 1,4- diazabicyclo[2,2,2]octane, dibutyltin oxide, tin dioctoate or dibutyltin dilaurate, tin bis(2-ethylhexanoate) or other organometallic compounds<br>
Subsequently any of constituents Al) - A6) not added at the beginning of the reaction are metered in<br>

The reaction of components Al) - A4) to form the prepolymer is partial or complete, but preferably complete The degree of conversion is typically monitored by following the NCO content of the reaction mixture This can be done using either spectroscopic measurements, examples being infrared or near-infrared spectra, determinations of the refractive index, or else using chemical analyses, such as titrations, on samples taken In this way, polyurethane prepolymers containing free isocyanate groups are obtained, in bulk (without solvent) or in solution<br>
Dunng or after the preparation of the polyurethane prepolymers from Al) to A4), and if It has not already been earned out in the starting molecules, the anionically and/or catiomcally dispersing groups are converted partly or fully to the salt form In the case of anionic groups this is done using bases such as ammonia, ammonium carbonate or ammonium hydrogen carbonate, tnmethylamine, tnethylamine, tnbutylamine, diisopropylethylamine, dimethylethanolamine, diethylethanolamme, tnethanolamine, potassium hydroxide or sodium carbonate, preferably tnethylamine, tnethanolamine,<br>

The PU dispersions of the invention are typically prepared either by introducing the dissolved prepolymer or the chain-extended polyurethane polymer into the dispersing water, where appropnate with strong sheanng, such as vigorous stimng, for example, or, conversely, the dispersing water is added to the prepolymer or polymer solutions It is preferred to add the water to the dissolved prepolymer<br><br>
The solvent A6) still present in the dispersions after the dispersing step is typically then removed distillatively The distillation is preferably earned out under reduced pressure Removal actually during dispersing is likewise possible<br>

The invention additionally provides the above-described coated substrates and articles manufactured from them<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
Determination of thermal yellowing<br>
25 g of the polyurethane-polyurea dispersion are introduced into a glass dish (10x20 cm2) and dried at 60°C overnight A portion of the resulting film is placed on a glass plate and stored at 120°C for 168 h The discoloration is assessed by visual comparison of the samples<br>
Detection of hydrazine in polyurethane-polyurea dispersions<br>
The dispersion is diluted 1000 times To 5 ml of this dilute solution there are added 5 ml of Aquamerck® hydrazine (colorimeter determmation with 4-dimethylamino-benzaldehyde) A yellow coloration indicates hydrazine<br>
The determination of the effective particle diameter is earned out using the Particle Size Analyzer 90 Plus from Brookfield Instruments Corporation<br>
The determination of the viscosity of the dispersion is earned out using a DIN CUP 4 at 20°C, the efflux time is measured in seconds<br>
Example 1 (comparative)<br>
254 0 g (124 5 mmol) of polycarbonatediol based on 3-methyl-l,5-pentanedio 1/1,6-hexanediol (Placed CD220PL, OHZ = 55), 12 1 g (90 mmol) of dimethylolpropionoic acid, 1 34 g (10 mmol) of tnmethylolpropane, 17 0 g (10 mmol) of Polyglykol Bl 1/50 (monofiinctional polyether based on ethylene oxide/propylene oxide) and 90 g of N-methylpyrrolidone are mixed at 65°C Subsequently a mixture of 50 4 g (228 mmol) of isophorone dusocyanate and 26 2 g (100 mmol) of 4,4'-dissocyanatodlcyclohexyl-methane is added and the mixtures are stirred at 90°C until the theoretical NCO value is reached After allowing the prepolymer to cool somewhat, 150 g of acetone are added, cooling is continued to 40-50°C, and 9 1 g (90 mmol) of tnethylamine are added Subsequently 713 g of cold water (5-10°C) are stirred in over the course of 10 minutes This low-viscosity dispersion is admixed over the course of 10 minutes with a solution of 5 35 g (89 mmol) of 1,2-ethylenediamine in 40 g of water, after which stirring takes place for 15 minutes The acetone is then removed by vacuum distillation (2 h at up to<br>
40°C and approx 200 mbar) This gives a storage-stable dispersion having a solids content of 30% by weight, an effective particle diameter of 54 nm and a viscosity of 14 s<br>
Example 2 (comparative)<br>
The prepolymer is prepared as in Example 1 After allowing the prepolymer to cool somewhat, 150 g of acetone are added, cooling is continued to 40-50°C, and 9 1 g (90 mmol) of triethylamme are added Subsequently 713 g of cold water (5-10°C) are stirred in over the course of 10 minutes This low-viscosity dispersion is admixed over the course of 10 minutes with a solution of 4 45 g (89 mmol) of hydrazine monohydrate in 40 g of water, after which stirring takes place for 15 minutes The acetone is then removed by vacuum distillation (2 h at up to 40°C and approx 200 mbar) This gives a storage-stable dispersion having a solids content of 30% by weight, an effective particle diameter of 52 nm and a viscosity of 14 s<br>
Example 3 (comparative)<br>
The polyurethane-polyurea dispersion is prepared as in Example 2 However, instead of the 150 g of acetone, the same amount of ethyl acetate is used When water is added a dispersion of relatively high viscosity is obtained with a gel-like consistency, its viscosity dropping only slightly even when the hydrazine hydrate is added The distillation takes place at up to 40°C and approximately 200 mbar In the course of the distillation there is a marked drop in the viscosity of the dispersion After 2 h there is still a strong odour perceptible, after 4 h only a slight odour of ethyl acetate A storage-stable dispersion is obtained which has a solids content of 30% by weight, an effective particle diameter of 90 nm and a viscosity of 18 s<br>
Example 4 (inventive)<br>
The polyurethane-polyurea dispersion is prepared as in Example 2 However, the 150 g of acetone are replaced by the same amount of methyl acetate This gives a storage-stable dispersion having a solids content of 30% by weight, an effective particle diameter of 48 nm and a viscosity of 14 s<br>
Example 5 (inventive)<br>
403 g (204 mmol) of polycaprolactonediol (OHZ = 56 8), 105 1 g (103 mmol) of polypropylene glycol (OHZ = 110), 34 3 g (256 mmol) of dimethylolpropiomc acid and 17 4 g (100 mmol) of adipic dihydrazide are introduced at 60°C and 300 g of methyl acetate and 0 1 g of dibutyltin dilaurate are added Subsequently 194 0 g (878 mmol) of isophorone dusocyanates are added and the mixture is stirred under reflux until the theoretical NCO value is reached This prepolymer is cooled to 40-50°C and then 25 9 g (256 mmol) of triethylamine are added Then 1200 g of cold water (5-10°C) are stirred in over the course of 10 minutes This dispersion is admixed over the course of 10 minutes with a solution of 10 2 g (204 mmol) of hydrazine monohydrate in 40 g of water, and stimng takes place for 15 minutes This is followed by the removal of the methyl acetate by vacuum distillation This gives a storage-stable dispersion having a solids content of 32 5% by weight, an effective particle diameter of 50 nm and a viscosity of 14 s<br>
Evaluation of results<br>
In comparison to inventive Example 4, comparative Example 1 shows a much more severe thermal yellowing<br>
With comparative Example 2, in contrast to inventive Example 4, hydrazine can be detected<br>
With comparative Example 3, in contrast to comparative Example 2, there is no hydrazine detectable, and the thermal yellowing is similar to that for inventive Example 4 However, distinct processing disadvantages are in evidence as compared with inventive Example 4 For instance, the viscosity of the dispersion prior to distillation imposes significantly more exacting requirements on the apparatus and is possibly no longer manageable on the production scale Moreover, the removal of the ethyl acetate takes significantly greater time and energy than in the case of acetone or methyl acetate As compared with inventive Example 4, the viscosity of the dispersion is increased and the effective particle diameter is significantly enlarged, this being clearly perceptible to the naked eye and leading to performance disadvantages on application, such as a lower depth of penetration into absorbent substrates, for example<br>
In processing terms, Example 4 and comparative Example 2 are virtually identical, with the consequence that methyl acetate does not carry any disadvantages as compared with acetone<br>
Example 5 shows thermal yellowing at a low level similar to that of Example 4 No significant amounts of hydrazine are detectable.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
