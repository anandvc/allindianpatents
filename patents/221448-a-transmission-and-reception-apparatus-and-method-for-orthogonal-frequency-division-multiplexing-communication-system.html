				<td>APPARATUS AND .METHOD FOR TRANSMITTING AND RECEIVING SIDE INFORMATION OF A PARTIAL TRANSMIT SEQUENCE IN AN OFDM<br>
COMMUNICATION SYSTEM<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates generally to an orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) communication system, and in particular, to an apparatus and method for transmitting and receiving side information in a partial transmit sequence <ij i s scheme.></ij>
2.	Description of the Related Art<br>
OFDM technology has high spectrum efficiency because spectra of subchannels overlap with each other while maintaining orthogonality. According to the OFDM technology, input information symbols are modulated by inverse fast Fourier hausform (hereinafter referred to as "IFFT"). while the IFFT modulated signal is demodulated by last Fourier transform (hereinafter referred to as'TFT').<br>
A brief description will now be made regarding operations of a transmitter and a receiver in a mobile communication system employing the OFDM technology (hereinafter referred to as "OFDM mobile communication system").<br>
In an OFDM transmitter, input data is modulated with a sub-carrier through a scrambler, a coder, and an interleaves The transmitter provides a variable data rate, and applies a different coding rate, interleaving size, and modulation scheme according to the data rate. Commonly, the coder uses a coding rate of 1/2 or 3/4, and the interleaving size for preventing a burst error is determined according to the number of coded bits per OFDM symbol (NCBPS). QPSK (Quadrature Phase Shift Keying), 8PSK (8-ary Phase Shift Keying), 16QAM (16-ary Quadrature Amplitude Modulation), and 64QAM (64-ary QAM) are used as the modulation scheme. A signal modulated with a predetermined number of sub-carriers by the elements stated above is summed up with a predetermined number of pilot sub-carriers, and then subjected to IFFT, thereby forming one OFDM signal. A guard interval for eliminating inter-symbol interference in a multi-path channel environment is inserted into the OFDM signal, and the guard interval-inserted OFDM signal is transmitted over a radio channel by a radio frequency (RF) processor, after<br><br>
passing through a symbol waveform generator.<br>
In an OFDM receiver corresponding to the above-described transmitter, a reverse operation of the transmitter is performed and a synchronization process is added. First, a process of estimating a frequency offset and a symbol offset using a predetermined training symbol must be preferentially performed. Thereafter, a guard interval-eliminated data symbol is restored with a predetermined number of sub-carriers with which a predetermined number of pilot sub-carriers were summed up, through FFT. In order to cope with propagation delay in a radio channel environment, an equalizer eliminates signal distortion clue to a channel from a received signal by estimating a channel condition. Data, a channel response of which was compensated through the equatizen is converted into a bit stream and then deintcrlcaved by a deinlerieaver. Thereafter, the deiinterleaved data is restored into final data through a decoder lor error correction and a descrambler.<br>
The OFDM technology performs low-speed parallel transmission using a plurality of carriers instead of transmitting input data at high speed with a single carrier. That is, the OFDM technology is characterized in that it can realize a modulation/demodulation unit with an efficient digital device and is less susceptible to frequency selective fading or narrowband interference. Due to the characteristics stated above, OFDM technology is effective for the current European digital broadcasting transmission and high-speed data transmission adopted as the standard specification for a high-capacity mobile communication system, such as IEEE 802.11 a, IEEE 802.16a, and IEEE 802.16b.<br>
The OFDM mobile communication system transmits data with a plurality of sub-carriers, so an amplitude level of an OFDM signal can be represented by the sum of amplitude levels of the multiple sub-earriers. However, when a phase of each of the sub-earriers is changed without maintaining orthogonality, a phase of a particular sub-carrier may coincide with a phase of another sub-earrier. When phases of the sub-carriers are the same, an OFDM signal has a very high peak-to-average power ratio (hereinafter referred to as "P.APR"). An OFDM signal having a high PAPR reduces efficiency of a high-power linear amplifier and shifts an operating point of the high-power linear amplifier to a non-linear region, thereby causing inter-modulation distortion and spread spectrum between sub-earriers. In the OFDM communication system, the PAPR is a very important factor that affects communication performance. Therefore, a great amount of research has been conducted on a scheme for reducing the PAPR.<br><br>
As a scheme for reducing PAPR in an OFDM communication system, there are provided a clipping scheme, a block coding scheme, and a phase rotation scheme. The clipping scheme, the block coding scheme, and the phase rotation scheme will be described herein below.<br>
in the clipping scheme, if a level of a signal exceeds a predetermined threshold value, the level is forcibly clipped to the threshold value, thereby reducing PAPR. However, as a result, m-band distortion occurs due to non-linear operation, causing an increase in a bit error rate (hereinafter referred to as "OCR"), and adjacent channel interference occurs due to out-band clipping noise.<br>
 (2 )_Block__Coding Scheme<br>
The block coding scheme codes surplus earners and transmits the coded carriers to decrease PAPR of the whole carrier signal. The block coding scheme cannot only correct an error due to coding, but also decreases PAPR without distorting a signal. However, an increase in the number of the sub-carriers causes a drastic decrease in spectrum efficiency and an increase in the size of a look- up table or a generation matrix, disadvantageous!}' increasing complexity and calculations.<br>
(3) Phase Rotation Scheme<br>
The phase rotation scheme is classified into a selective mapping (hereinafter referred to as "SLM") scheme and a partial transmit sequence (hereinafter referred to as "PTS") scheme. The SLM scheme multiplies each of M same data blocks by each of different phase sequences of length N, which are statistically independent of one another, selects a result having the lowest PAPR (i.e., a phase sequence having the lowest PAPR), and transmits the selected phase sequence. The SLM scheme is disadvantageous in that it requires M IFFT operations. However, the SLM scheme can considerably decrease PAPR and can be applied regardless of the number of sub-earriers.<br>
Unlike the SLM scheme, the PTS scheme divides input data into M sub-blocks, performs L-point IFFT on each sub-block, multiplies each IFFT-transformed sub-block by a phase factor to minimize PAPR, and then sums the resultant sub-blocks before transmission. The PTS scheme is superior to the SLM scheme in terms of PAPR reduction, and is considered as the most effective and flexible scheme for reducing PAPR without non-linear distortion.<br><br>
With reference to FIG. 1, a description will now be made of a transmitter for an OFDM communication system employing the PTS scheme (hereinafter referred to as "PTS-OFDM communication system").<br>
FIG. 1 illustrates an internal structure of a transmitter for a conventional OFDM communication system employing a PTS scheme. As illustrated in FIG, 1, a transmitter 100 for the PTS-OFDM communication system includes a mapper 110, a serial-to-parallel (S/P) converter 120, a sub-block segmentation unit 130, a plurality of IFFT units 140, 142, 144, and 140, a phase factor determiner 150, a plurality of multipliers 160, 162, 164, and 166. and a combiner 170.<br>
Referring to FIG. 1, information bits to be transmitted are first coded at a predetermined coding rale, and coded bits generated by the coding are interleaved and then provided to the mapper 110 as input data X. Although various coding schemes have been proposed, a turbo coding scheme using a turbo code, which is an error correction code, is typically used as the coding scheme. The predetermined coding rate includes 1,2 and 3/4.<br>
The mapper 1 10 maps the input data X to a corresponding modulation symbol according to a predetermined modulation scheme, and the S/P converter 120 provides the modulation symbols sequentially output from the mapper 110 to L parallel lines, where L represents the number of taps of the IFFT units 140 to 146. The sub-block segmentation unit 130 segments modulation symbols output in parallel from the S/P converter 120 into M sub-blocks X(1) to X(M) having the same length N (L=NxM). It is assumed herein that the S/P converter 120 and the sub-block segmentation unit 130 are separately provided. Of course, however, the S/P converter 120 can be removed, and instead, the sub-block segmentation unit 130 can include a function of the S/P converter 120. In this case, the sub-block segmentation unit 130 segments L symbols sequentially provided from the mapper 110 into M sub-blocks having a length N.<br>
A sub-block conversion operation of the sub-block segmentation unit 130 will be described with reference to FIGs. 2 to 4. FIG. 2 illustrates sub-blocks segmented according to an adjacent sub-block segmentation scheme, FIG. 3 illustrates sub-blocks segmented according to an interleaved sub-block segmentation scheme, and FIG. 4 illustrates sub-blocks segmented according to a pseudo random sub-block segmentation scheme. In all of the sub-block segmentation schemes, sub-blocks must be segmented so that each sub-block should not overlap with other sub-blocks.<br><br>
A description will now be made of the sub-block segmentation schemes.<br>
(1)_Adjacent Sub-block Segmentation Scheme<br>
The adjacent sub-block segmentation scheme segments modulation symbols of length L into sub-blocks by the sequentially adjacent modulation symbols. As illustrated in FIG. 2, if the length L is 12, the adjacent sub-block segmentation scheme segments the modulation symbols of length 12 into 4 sub-blocks by the 3 sequentially adjacent modulation symbols.<br>
(2)Interleaved Sub-block Segmentation Scheme<br>
The interleaved sub-block segmentation scheme segments modulation symbols of length L into sub-blocks by interleaving. As illustrated in FIG. 3, if the length 1, is 12. the interleaved sub-block segmentation scheme segments the modulation symbols of length 12 into a total of 4 sub-blocks by combining 3 modulation symbols at periods of 4 modulation symbols.<br>
( V) Pseudo Random Sub-block_Segmentation Scheme<br>
The pseudo random sub-block segmentation scheme segments modulation symbols of length L into sub-blocks by pseudo-randomly selecting the modulation symbols. As illustrated in FIG. 4, if the length L is 12, the pseudo random sub-block segmentation scheme segments the modulation symbols of length 12 into a total of 4 sub-blocks by randomly combining 3 modulation symbols without any rule or pattern.<br>
In FIGs. 2 to 4, in each of sub-blocks segmented by the sub-block segmentation unit 130, all other symbols than the L symbols located in the determined positions are all replaced with 0.<br>
The IFFT units 140 to 146 perform IFFT on each of the segmented sub-blocks and generate IFFT-transformed sub-blocks x(1) to x(M). The phase factor determiner 150 receives the IFFT-transformed sub-blocks x(l) to x(M) and determines phase factors b(1) to b(M) in such a way that phases of the sub-blocks should be different than one another, in order to minimize PAPR when the sub-blocks x(1) to x(M) are summed. Next, the phase factors are matched with their corresponding sub-blocks. That is, the phase factor b(1) is matched with the sub-block x(l). In this manner, the phase factor b(M) is matched with the sub-block x(M). The multipliers 160 to 166 multiply the IFFT-transformed sub-blocks x(1) to X(M) by the corresponding phase factors b(1) to b(M) , and provide their outputs to the combiner 170. The combiner 170 generates an OFDM signal x by combining (or<br><br>
summing) the outputs of the multipliers 160 to 166.<br>
As described above, the PTS scheme can effectively reduce PAPR without distorting a sub-channel spectrum and can be applied regardless of a digital modulation scheme. However, in order to enable a receiver to restore (or decode) information data, side information for a phase factor for phase rotation must be transmitted along with the data. Therefore, in order to realize the PTS scheme in an OFDM communication system, a method for effectively transmitting the side information is required.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
Several preferred embodiments of the present invention will now be described in detail with reference to the annexed drawings. In the drawings, the same or similar elements are denoted by the same reference numerals even though they are depicted in different drawings. In the following description, a detailed description of blown functions and configurations incorporated herein has been omitted for conciseness.<br>
The present invention provides an apparatus and method for reducing a peak-to-average power ratio (PAPRj while maintaining an original signal in a communication system employing an orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) technology (hereinafter referred to as "OFDM communication system"). Specifically, the present invention provides an apparatus and method for transmitting and receiving side information for rolalion factors, i.e., phase factors, for accurate data restoration in a receiver for an OFDM communication system employing a partial transmit sequence (hereinafter referred to as "PTS") scheme. The side information for the rotation factors is carried on a phase of a reference symbol that is transmitted along with data.<br>
In the following description of the present invention, specific details such as OFDM modulation, inverse fast Fourier transform (hereinafter referred to as "IFFT"), fast Fourier transform (hereinafter referred to as "FFT"), spectrum efficiency, and bit error rate (BER) will be used for better understanding of the present invention. However, it would be obvious to those skilled in the art that the invention can be easily implemented without the specific details.<br>
FIG. 5 illustrates an internal structure of a transmitter for an OFDM communication system employing a PTS scheme (hereinafter referred to as "PTS-OFDM communication") according to an embodiment of the present invention. As illustrated in FIG. 5, a PTS-OFDM communication transmitter 200 includes a mapper 210, a serial-to-parallel (S/P) converter 220, a sub-block segmentation unit 230, a plurality of IFFT units 240, 242, 244 and 246, a phase factor determiner 250, a plurality of multipliers 260, 262, 264 and 266, a combiner 270, and a reference symbol inserter 280.<br><br>
In the transmitter 200, transmission information is coded at a predetermined coding rate, and the coded bits generated by the coding are interleaved and then provided to the mapper 210 as input data D. Although various coding schemes have been proposed, a turbo coding scheme using a turbo code, which is an error correction code, is typically used as the coding scheme. The predetermined coding rate includes 1/2 and 3/4.<br>
The mapper 210 maps the input data D to a corresponding modulation symbol according to a predetermined modulation scheme, and the S/P converter 220 converts the modulation symbols sequentially output from the mapper 210 into parallel symbols. The number of output symbols from the S/P converter 220 is smaller than the number 'L' of laps of the IFFT units 240 to 246. This is because reference symbols must be added to the output symbols of the S/P converter 220. Because one reference symbol is inserted into each sub-block, the number of parallel lines connected to the outputs of the S/P converter 220 must be smaller than the number 'L' of the input taps by the number 'M" of the sub-blocks. That is. the number of parallel lines must be 'L.-M'.<br>
The sub-block segmentation unit 230 segments modulation symbols output in parallel from the S/P converter 220 into M sub-blocks D(1) to D(M) having the same length N. As described in conjunction with the prior art, in each of sub-blocks segmented by the sub-block segmentation unit 230, all other symbols than the N symbols located in the determined positions are all replaced with 0. It is assumed herein that the S/P converter 220 and the sub-block segmentation unit 230 are separately provided. Of course, however, the S/P converter 220 can be removed, and instead, the sub-block segmentation unit 230 can include a function of the S/P converter 220. In this case, the sub-block segmentation unit 230 segments L symbols sequentially provided from the mapper 210 into M sub-blocks having a length N.<br>
The reference symbol inserter 280 inserts a reference symbol having an amplitude 1 and a phase 0° in a preset position of each of the sub-blocks D(1) to D(M), thereby generating new sub-blocks X(1) to X(M). The new sub-blocks X(1) to X(M) each have one more symbol, compared with the sub-blocks D(1) to D(M). Herein, phases of the reference symbols inserted in the sub-blocks D(1) to D(M) are all set to 0° so that a receiver can detect phase factors of the sub-blocks from the phases of received reference symbols.<br>
In an alternative embodiment, phases of the reference symbols can be alternately set to 0° and 1800, or sequentially set to 0°, 90°, 180° and 270°. In another<br><br>
preferred embodiment, phases of the reference symbols can be set to complementary sequence phases or Walsh sequence phases.<br>
Methods of inserting reference symbols according to a type of sub-block segmentation schemes of the sub-block segmentation unit 230 are illustrated in FIGs. 6 to 8. In FIGs. 6 to 8, white circle represent data symbols, while black circles represent reference symbols.<br>
It is assumed in FIGs. 6 to 8 that there are provided IFFT units having 16 taps, and 4 sub-blocks having a length 3 (L=l6, N=3, and M=4). FIG. 6 illustrates sub-blocks segmented according to an adjacent sub-block segmentation scheme. FIG. 7 illustrates sub-blocks segmented according to an interleaved sub-block segmentation scheme, and FIG. S illustrates sub-blocks segmented according to a pseudo random sub-block segmentation scheme. In all of the sub-block segmentation schemes, sub-blocks are segmented in such a way that each sub-block should not overlap with other sub-blocks, and reference symbols are inserted in the same positions regardless of the sub-block segmentation schemes. This is because a receiver previously recognizes the positions where the reference symbols are inserted, and determines phase factors of the sub-blocks according to the extent by which phases of the reference symbols are rotated.<br>
A description will now be made of the sub-block segmentation schemes.<br>
(1)	Adjacent Sub-block Segmentation Scheme<br>
The adjacent sub-block segmentation scheme segments modulation symbols of length L into sub-blocks by the sequentially adjacent modulation symbols. As illustrated in FIG. 6, if the length L is 16, the adjacent sub-block segmentation scheme segments the modulation symbols of length 16 into 4 sub-blocks by the 4 sequentially adjacent modulation symbols, i.e., 3 modulation symbols and 1 reference symbol.<br>
(2)	Interleaved Sub-block Segmentation Scheme<br>
The interleaved sub-block segmentation scheme segments modulation symbols of length L into sub-blocks by interleaving. As illustrated in FIG. 7, if the length L is 16, the interleaved sub-block segmentation scheme segments the modulation symbols of length 16 into a total of 4 sub-blocks by combining 3 modulation symbols at periods of 5 modulation symbols, and 1 reference symbol.<br>
(3)	Pseudo Random Sub-block Segmentation Scheme<br><br>
The pseudo random sub-block segmentation scheme segments modulation symbols of length L into sub-blocks by pseudo-randomly selecting the modulation symbols. As illustrated in FIG. 8, if the length L is 16, the pseudo random sub-block segmentation scheme segments the modulation symbols of length 16 into a total of 4 sub-blocks by randomly combining 3 modulation symbols and 1 reference symbol located in the preset position, without any rule or pattern.<br>
The IFFT units 240 to 246 perform IFFT on each of the reference symbol-inserted sub-blocks, and generate IFFT-trans formed sub-blocks x(1) to x(M). The phase factor determiner 250 receives the IFFT-transfomied sub-blocks x(l) to x(M) and determines phase factors b(1) to b(m) of the corresponding sub-blocks in such a way that phases of the sub-blocks should be different from one another, in order to minimize PAPR when the sub-blocks x'n to x|M) are summed. Herein, {±1 } or {±l.±j} is used as the phase factors.<br>
The multipliers 260 to 260 multiply the IFFT-transformed sub-blocks x(1) to x(M) by the corresponding phase factors b(1) to b(M), and provide their outputs to the combiner 270. The combiner 270 generates an OFDM signal x by combining (or summing) the outputs of the multipliers 260 to 266.<br>
A PTS operation according to the present invention will now be described in more detail with reference to the following formulas.<br>
Equation (1) represents input data D segmented into M sub-blocks D(1) to D(M), and reference symbols R (R(1) to R(M)) inserted in the corresponding sub-blocks.<br>
Equation (1)<br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
In Equation (1), D denotes data, and R denotes a reference symbol. The data D is segmented into a plurality of sub-blocks D(l) to D(M) having the same size according to a selected one of the adjacent sub-block segmentation scheme, the interleaved sub-block segmentation scheme, and the pseudo random sub-block segmentation scheme, described in conjunction with FIGs. 6 to 8.<br><br>
The sub-blocks comprised of the data D and the reference symbols R can be represented by<br>
Equation (2) (Equation Removed)<br>
In Equation (2), X denotes a sub-block.<br>
The phase factor determiner 250 determines proper phase factors that will be multiplied by the M segmented sub-blocks in order to minimize PAPR. If the phase factors to be multiplied by the sub-blocks are defined as "b", an input .V of the IFFT unit 240 is represented by<br>
Equation (3) (Equation Removed)<br>
In Equation (3), {b(m), m=l, 2,---, M} represents phase factors multiplied by the sub-blocks, and it is assumed that the phase factors simply control a rotation operation over the IFFT-transformed sub-blocks. The input A' represented by Equation (3) is converted into a time domain by the IFFT unit 240, and the result x is represented by<br>
Equation (4) (Equation Removed)<br><br>
In Equation (4), the vector x(m) indicates PTS.<br>
Phase factors b(m) determined to minimize PAPR of the x are selected by<br>
Equation (5) (Equation Removed)<br><br>
In Equation (5), L denotes the number of input taps, or the number of sub-caniers, and / denotes an index for identifying each of the sub-earriers. Equation (5)<br>
selects a set of phase factors for minimizing a maximum value determined by multiplying the sub-blocks by the phase factors. A set of the phase factors will be referred to as "rotation factor." An optimized transmission signal for the rotation factor is defined as<br>
Equation (6) (Equation Removed)<br><br>
FIG. 9 illustrates an internal structure of a receiver for a PTS-OFDM communication system according to an embodiment of the present invention. As illustrated in FIG. 9, a PTS-OFDM communication receiver 300 includes a serial-to-parallel (S/P) converter 310, an FFT unit 320, a sub-block segmentation unit 330, a plurality of reference symbol detectors 340, 342, and 344, a plurality of inverse phase rotation units 350, 352, and 354, a plurality of reference symbol eliminators 360, 362, and 364, a combiner 370, a parallel-to-serial (P/S) converter 380, and a demapper 390.<br>
Received radio frequency (RF) signals carried on a plurality of sub-carriers are converted into digital signals, and the digital signals undergo a predetermined signal processing process for synchronization and node cancellation, and then are provided to the S/P converter 310 as a received signal y.<br>
The S/P converter 310 converts the received signal y into parallel symbols by the symbol, and provides the parallel symbols to L parallel lines, where L represents the number of input taps of the FFT unit 320. The FFT unit 320 performs L-point FFT on the parallel symbols output from the S/P converter 310. The sub-block segmentation unit 330 segments the L symbols output from the FFT unit 320 into M sub-blocks having the same length, and provides the segmented sub-blocks to the reference symbol detectors 340 to 344.<br>
The reference symbol detectors 340 to 344 each detect reference symbols from the sub-blocks provided from the sub-block segmentation unit 330. Since the reference symbol inserted by a transmitter has amplitude 1 and a phase 0°, a phase of the detected reference symbol represents phase variation, i.e., a phase factor, of symbols constituting a corresponding sub-block. As described above, because the transmitter 200 and the receiver 300 both know the position where the reference symbol is inserted, the reference symbol detectors 340 to 344 can detect a reference symbol from each of the<br><br>
sub-blocks.<br>
The inverse phase rotation units 350 to 354 inversely rotate phases of the sub-blocks received from the sub-block segmentation unit 330 by the phase variation of the reference symbols detected by the reference symbol detectors 340 to 344. The reference symbol eliminators 360 to 364 eliminate reference symbols from the sub-blocks provided from the inverse phase rotation units 350 to 354. The combiner 370 combines outputs of the reference symbol eliminators 360 to 364 by the symbol. Parallel outputs of the combiner 370 are converted into a serial signal by the P/S converter 380. and then restored into received data D by the demapper 390 according to a corresponding modulation scheme.<br>
With reference to the structure of the transmitter 200, a detailed description will now be made of a procedure for extracting side information and restoring data by the transmitter 300 of the PTS-OFDM communication system.<br>
A signal y received over a radio channel is represented by<br>
Equation (7)<br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
In Equation (7), x denotes a transmission signal, and n represents a noise. If the received signal y is FFT-transformed, the resultant signal Y is represented by<br>
Equation (8)<br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
In Equation (S), x(m) denotes an mth sub-block constituting the transmission signal x , b(m) denotes an mth phase factor applied to the mth sub-block, and N denotes an FFT-transformed noise. If the FFT-transformed x(m) is expressed with X(m) as<br>
illustrated above, the X(m) can be divided into a reference symbol R(m) and actual data D(m). Therefore, the received signal is divided into data D , reference symbol R , and noise N. Because a reference symbol inserted by the transmitter is characterized by R(m) = ej() = 1 , the reference symbol R can be represented by<br>
Equation (9) (Equation Removed)<br><br><br>
Therefore, a phase of a reference symbol   (Equation Removed)<br><br>
inserted in the received signal represents a phase factor, i.e.. side information.<br>
Equation (10) below multiplies the received signal by an inverse value (R)' of a phase of the received reference symbol in order to restore data. Mere, * represents inverse rotation of a phase.<br>
Equation (10) (Equation Removed)<br><br>
If a reference symbol in a second term is excluded from the result of Equation (10), the received signal is represented by<br>
Equation (11)<br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
Here, if the noise is ignored, data is exactly restored.<br>
Now, a description will be made as to how the accurate transmission/reception<br>
of side information for a PTS scheme affects the OFDM communication system when the OFDM communication system employs the PTS scheme in order to reduce PAPR.<br>
If a side infomiation error occurs, the total bit error rate of the system is represented by<br>
Equation (12) (Equation Removed)<br><br>
In Equation (12), Pb denotes a bit error rate in an AWGN (Additive White Gaussian Noise) channel during QPSK modulation, and is defined as<br>
Equation (13)<br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
In addition. Pb/Fulse) denotes a conditional bit error rate in a condition where side information has an error, and is defined as<br>
Equation (14) (Equation Removed)<br>
In Equation (14), Q( ) denotes a known Q function, and crs denotes distribution of a received signal and is expressed as crs = 2Eb by bit energy Eb of the received signal. In addition, σ2N denotes distribution of a noise when a side infomiation error occurs, and is expressed as σ2False = (N - M) • 2Eb .<br>
FIG. 10 illustrates a comparison on a complementary cumulative distribution function (CCDF) of PAPR among a conventional OFDM communication system not employing the PTS scheme, a conventional PTS-OFDM communication system, and a novel PTS-OFDM communication system that transmits side information (SI). The CCDF is a probability that PAPR will be higher than a predetermined, threshold value PAPR0. As illustrated, the novel PTS-OFDM communication system shows the same PAPR reduction performance as the conventional PTS-OFDM communication system.<br>
FIG. 11 illustrates a comparison on CCDF of PAPR among OFDM communication systems employing the adjacent sub-block segmentation scheme, the interleaved sub-block segmentation scheme, and the pseudo random sub-block segmentation scheme. As illustrated in FIG. 11, the pseudo random sub-block segmentation scheme is most superior and the adjacent sub-block segmentation scheme is most inferior in terms of PAPR reduction performance. In the present invention, the interleaved sub-block segmentation scheme segments only data by interleaved sub-block segmentation, and inserts a reference symbol therein. That is, only data is segmented by interleaved sub-block segmentation. PAPR reduction performance by the interleaved sub-block segmentation scheme is superior to that of the adjacent sub-block segmentation scheme.<br>
FIG. 12 illustrates numerical analysis results and simulation results on Equation (12). In FIG. 12, when Ps=10-2 and 10-3, an error floor occurs. However, when Ps=Pb, performance deterioration due to a side information error is not so high. In addition, a bit error rate for Ps-0 is equal to an error rate of QPSK modulation in AWGN.<br>
As described above, the present invention is applied to a PTS scheme for efficiently reducing a high PAPR, which is the biggest drawback when using multiple sub-carriers in an OFDM communication system, and the present invention transmits side information related to the use of the PTS scheme so that a receiver can accurately restore information data. A side information transmission/reception apparatus and method proposed by the present invention can be applied regardless of a type of a modulation scheme, and can be realized with a simple structure. Furthermore, the proposed apparatus and method can maintain PAPR reduction performance. In addition, the novel side information transmission method using a reference symbol can transmit the side information on a real-time basis, so it can be applied to an OFDM communication system.<br>
