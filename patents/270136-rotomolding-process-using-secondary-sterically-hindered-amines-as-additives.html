Use of Secondary Stericallv Hindered Amines as Processing Additives in Rotomoldina Processes<br>
The instant invention pertains to the use of secondary sterically hindered amines as processing additives in rotational molding processes. These additives increase process ^     stabihty, since they provide a broader temperature range towards higher temperatures during the melt processing step.<br>
Rotational molding is a highly versatile manufacturing option that allows for unhmited design possibihties with the added benefit of low production costs.<br>
The rotational molding process (rotomolding process) starts with a good quahty mold that is placed in a molding machine that has a loading, heating, and coohng area.<br>
Several molds may be placed on the machine at the same time. Pre-measured plastic resin is loaded into each mold, and then the molds are moved into the oven where they are slowly rotated on both the vertical and horizontal axis. The melting resin sticks to the hot mold and coats every surface evenly. The mold continues to rotate during the coohng cycle so the parts retain an even wall thickness.<br>
Once the parts are cooled, they are released from the mold. The rotational speed, heating and coohng times may be all controlled throughout the process.<br>
Rotational molding offers design advantages over other molding processes. With proper design, parts that are assembled from several pieces can be molded as one part, ehminating expensive fabrication costs.<br>
The process also has a number of inherent design strengths, such as consistent wall thickness and strong outside corners that are virtually stress free. If additional strength is required, reinforcing ribs can be designed into the part.<br>
Rotational molding dehvers the product the designer envisions. Designers can select the best material for their apphcation, including materials that meet FDA requirements. Additives to help make the part weather resistant, flame retardant, or static free can be specified.<br><br>
And because parts are formed with heat and rotation, rather than pressure, molds don't need to be engineered to withstand the high pressure of injection molding.<br>
Production costs for product conversions are reduced because hghtweight plastics replace heavier, often more costly materials, which makes rotational molding as cost effective for one-of-a-kind prototypes as it is for large production runs<br>
Rotational molding is versatile and able to handle a vast variety of shapes and sizes. Many parts cannot be readily produced by any other method. Typical examples are specialty tanks and containers for fuel, water, and chemical processing, hvestock feeders, drainage systems, food service containers, instrument housings, vending machines, highway barriers and road markers. Other apphcation areas are consumer products, toys and transportation. Many aspects of the rotational molding process are, for example, described by R. J. Crawford and J. L. Throne in Rotational Molding Technology, Plastics Design hbrary, Wilham Andrew Pubhshing, 2001.<br>
As mentioned above rotational speed, heating and coohng times may be all controlled throughout the process. The maximum temperature of the air, which is reached inside the hollow molded article, depends strongly on the heating time. This temperature is also called peak internal air temperature (PIAT). It correlates with the temperature of the molten resin.<br>
The concept of peak internal air temperature (PIAT) and the consequences, if a too low or too high PIAT is apphed, is for example described by M. C. Cramez et al. in Proc. Instn Mech. Engrs. Vol. 217 Part B: J. of Engineering Manufacture, 2003.<br>
The peak internal air temperature can influence the final properties of the molded product. For example, if the temperature becomes too high, a strong yellowing may occur and also the mechanical properties are negatively affected, for example, the impact strength decreases significantly. If the temperature remains too low the final properties can also be adversely affected because the resins have not been properly molten. In other words, there is only a small temperature range for achieving the desired final properties. It is therefore of high interest to widen this temperature range or processing window, within which almost constant mechanical properties are obtained.<br><br>
Botkin et al in "An additive approach to cycle time reduction in rotational molding" Rotational Molding by Design Conference, Society of Plastics Engineers, 2004 have demonstrated that by using a proprietary process stabihzer, the PIAT can be shifted towards lower temperatures maintaining good impact strength. This con-esponds to broadening the processing window towards lower temperatures.<br>
Surprisingly it has now been found that when a secondary hindered amine compound is added to the resin formulation a significantly broader processing window towards higher temperatures is achieved without adversely affecting color and mechanical properties of the molded article.<br>
Consequently one aspect of the invention is the use of a secondary stericahy hindered amine compound as processing additive for enlarging the processing window towards higher peak internal air temperatures in rotational molding processes of thermoplastic polymers.<br>
Under processing window there Is understood the temperature range, as measured by the peak internal air method (PIAT), within which the mechanical properties and/or the color of the molded article remain essentially the same. A particularly suitable mechanical property to measure is impact strength, for example at low temperatures. Low temperature means in this context from 0° to -50° C, particularly -20° C to -40° C.<br><br><br><br>

The sterically hindered amine compound according to the invention is preferably added in an amount from 0.01 to 5%, more preferably from 0.05 to 2% and most preferably from 0.1 to 1 % by weight, based on the weight of the thermoplastic polymer.<br>
For instance the thermoplastic polymer is a polyolefin, a polyvinylchloride or a polyamide. Examples are given below.<br>
1. Polymers of monoolefins and diolefins, for example polypropylene, polyisobutylene, po-lybut-1-ene, poly-4-methylpent-1-ene, polyvinylcyclohexane, polyisoprene or polybutadiene, as well as polymers of cycloolefins, for instance of cyclopentene or norbornene, polyethylene (which optionally can be crosshnked), for example high density polyethylene (HOPE), high density and high molecular weight polyethylene (HDPE-HMW), high density and ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene (HDPE-UHMW), medium density polyethylene (MDPE), low density polyethylene (LDPE), hnear low density polyethylene (LLDPE), (VLDPE) and (ULDPE).<br>
Polyolefins, i.e. the polymers of monoolefins exemphfied in the preceding paragraph, prefe¬rably polyethylene and polypropylene, can be prepared by different, and especially by the following, methods:<br>
a)	radical polymerisation (normally under high pressure and at elevated temperature).<br>
b)	catalytic polymerisation using a catalyst that normally contains one or more than one<br>
metal of groups IVb, Vb, VIb or VIII of the Periodic Table. These metals usually have<br>
one or more than one hgand, typically oxides, hahdes, alcoholates, esters, ethers,<br>
amines, alkyls, alkenyls and/or aryls that may be either n- or a-coordinated. These<br>
metal complexes may be in the free form or fixed on substrates, typically on<br>
activated magnesium chloride, titanium(lll) chloride, alumina or sihcon oxide. These<br><br>
catalysts may be soluble or insoluble in the polymerisation medium. The catalysts can be used by themselves in the polymerisation or further activators may be used, typically metal alkyls, metal hydrides, metal alkyl hahdes, metal alkyl oxides or metal alkyloxanes, said metals being elements of groups la, lla and/or Iha of the Periodic Table. The activators may be modified conveniently with further ester, ether, amine or silyl ether groups. These catalyst systems are usually termed Philhps, Standard Oil Indiana, Ziegler (-Natta), TNZ (DuPont), metallocene or single site catalysts (SSC).<br>
2.	Mixtures of the polymers mentioned under 1), for example mixtures of polypropylene with polyisobutylene, polypropylene with polyethylene (for example PP/HDPE, PP/LDPE) and mixtures of different types of polyethylene (for example LDPE/HDPE).<br>
3.

4.	Polyamides and copolyamides derived from diamines and dicarboxyhc acids and/or from aminocarboxyhc acids or the corresponding lactams, for example polyamide 4, polyamide 6, polyamide 6/6, 6/10, 6/9, 6/12, 4/6, 12/12, polyamide 11, polyamide 12, aromatic polyamides<br><br>
starting from m-xylene diamine and adipic acid; polyamides prepared from hexamethylenediamine and isophthahc or/and terephtlnahc acid and with or without an ela¬stomer as modifier, for example poly-2,4,4,-trimethylhexamethylene terephthalamide or poly-m-phenylene isophthalamide; and also block copolymers of the aforementioned polyamides with poiyolefins, olefin copolymers, ionomers or chemically bonded or grafted elastomers; or with polyethers, e.g. with polyethylene glycol, polypropylene glycol or polytetramethylene glycol; as well as polyamides or copolyamides modified with EPDI\/I or ABS; and polyamides condensed during processing (Rll\/I polyamide systems).<br>
Particular preference is given to polyethylene preferably hnear low density polyethylene (LLDPE).<br>
For example the peak internal air temperature range in rotational molding processes is enlarged up to 10 to 50° C, preferably up to 15 to 40° C towards higher temperatures. The reference being without the addition of a sterically hindered amine.<br>
Preferably the peak internal air temperature range is from 210 to 250° C, more preferably from 215 to 250° C and most preferably from 220 to 250° C.<br>
The above temperature range corresponds to the preferred processing window, within which the mechanical properties and/or the color of the article are not adversely affected.<br>
In a specific embodiment of the invention an additional stabihzer selected from the group consisting of a UV-absorber, a sterically hindered amine, different from that of formula (I) or (II), a phenohc antioxidant, a phosphite or phosphonite and a benzofuranone or indohnone is present.<br>

The following examples illustrate the invention.<br>
Example 1: Preparation of Polyolefin Hollow Articles by a rotational molding process 100 parts medium density polyethylene, copolymerized with hexene (nominal melt index 3.3 g/10 min., density 0.938 g/cm^) are dry blended with 0.050 parts of zinc stearate and a combination of additional stabihzers as given in Table 1. The mixtures are melt compounded into pellets at 190 °C in a Superior/MPM extruder using a 24:1 L/D screw with Maddock mixing head at 100 rpm. The compounded pellets are ground to a uniform particle size (150-500 |hm) prior to the rotational molding process. This grinding step increases the surface area of the particles leading to faster heat absorption, and thus reducing overall energy consumption. The rotational molding process is performed in laboratory scale equipment FSP M20 "Clamshell". The ground resin is placed in an aluminum mold, which is rotated biaxially in a gas fired oven. Hot air is circulated by blowers in the chamber while the temperature is increased to 274°C. This temperature is maintained for a specific time, which<br><br>
will give a certain peak internal air temperature (PIAT) as given in Table 2. Subsequently, the oven is opened and while still rotating, the mold is cooled with forced air circulation for 7.3 minutes, followed by water spray mist for 1.5 minutes, air coohng for 2 minutes, water spray 2.9 minutes and air coohng 4.4 minutes. Throughout the entire heating and coohng cycles, i the speed of the major axis is maintained at 6 rpm with a 4 : 1 ratio of rotation. After the coohng cycles, the mold is opened and the hollow object removed.<br>
The processing range is defined as peak internal air temperature range (PIAT) in which a part with high impact strength can be produced. The impact strength is measured with the Dynatup Falhng weight method (25lb/20"") according to ASTM D-3763 at -40° C.<br><br>
The data clearly indicate that the useful process range can be significantly shifted towards higher temperatures by the use of secondary sterically hindered amine compounds without sacrificing the impact strength.<br>
Example 2: Preparation of Polyolefin Hollow Articles by a rotational molding process<br>
The procedure given in example 1 has been repeated with further additives as outhned in<br>
Table 3. The results are presented in Table 4<br><br><br>
Whereas the processing temperature, as measured by the peak internal air temperature, (PIAT) should not exceed 198° C if no sterically hindered amine is present, 210° are acceptable when a tertiary sterically hindered amine is present. However, this temperature can further be extended up to 221° C, when, according to the invention, a secondary sterically hindered amine has been added.<br>
