				<td>GLASS COMPOSITION INTENDED FOR THE MANUFACTURE OF WINDOWS<br>
The invention relates to a glass composition of the soda-lime-silicate type intended<br>
for the production of neutral glass with a blue, gray or bronze tint which possesses<br>
a high light transmission and a moderate energy transmission. Although the<br>
invention is not limited to such an application, it will be more particularly described<br>
with reference to automobile applications, especially for forming windshields and<br>
side windows located at the front of a vehicle.<br>
Windows intended for the automobile industry are subject to requirements of<br>
various kinds. With regard to optical properties, these requirements are governed<br>
by regulations, as in the case of the light transmission of a windshield, or concern<br>
the comfort of the user, for example when it is a question of limiting the heat inside<br>
the passenger compartment by having glass exhibiting as low an energy<br>
transmission as possible.<br>
Apart from the requirements relating to light transmission and to energy<br>
transmission, the windows located at the front of vehicles must satisfy the esthetic<br>
desires of automobile manufacturers as regards color, in particular relative to the<br>
dominant wavelength and to purity.<br>
To obtain a blue, gray or bronze glass, it is known to add coloring agents to<br>
the batch materials intended to be melted in order to produce the glass matrix,<br>
these being such as iron, selenium, nickel, cobalt, chromium, manganese or rare<br>
earths, for example cerium or erbium.<br>
However, it is still difficult to obtain glasses that combine a particular color, in<br>
terms of wavelength range and excitation purity, with specific characteristics, for<br>
example light transmission and energy transmission factors within a well-defined<br>
range of values. This is because it is recognized that not only is the color of the<br>
glass modified by the addition of a coloring agent or the substitution of one<br>
coloring agent with another and/or a change in the quantity or in the relative<br>
proportion of the coloring agents in a composition, but also that this may affect its<br>
light transmission and its structural qualities. For example, increasing the iron<br>
oxide content in a soda-lime-silicate composition for the purpose of improving the<br><br>
absorption of infrared and ultraviolet radiation gives a glass highly colored in<br>
the green, which is manifested by an increase in the excitation purity.<br>
In the automobile sector, the current trend is toward windows with a neutral<br>
tint, having as low an excitation purity as possible, so that they can be<br>
harmoniously integrated into the vehicle as a whole.<br>
Neutral gray glass obtained from compositions containing iron oxide, cobalt<br>
oxide and selenium and/or nickel oxide is already known.<br>
WO-A-96/04212 discloses a glass composition of neutral tint for automobiles,<br>
which comprises 0.3 to 0.7% of total iron (Fe2O3), 3 to 25 ppm of cobalt (Co3O4),<br>
0.5 to 10 ppm of selenium and optionally nickel oxide and/or titanium oxide. The<br>
glass obtained possesses an excitation purity of less than 6%.<br>
In EP-A-0 653 386, compositions have been proposed for obtaining gray<br>
glass that can be used for automobiles. Such glass is characterized in that it<br>
contains either 0.3 to 0.7% iron oxide, 3 to 50 ppm cobalt oxide and 1 to 15 ppm<br>
selenium, or 0.15 to 0.6% iron oxide, 15 to 55 ppm cobalt oxide and 25 to 350 ppm<br>
nickel oxide, and optionally up to 5 ppm selenium.<br>
EP-A-0 677 492 has disclosed a gray-green glass having a purity of less than<br>
1.6% under illuminant C. The glass is obtained from a composition containing 0.45<br>
to 0.95% iron oxide, 8 to 30 ppm cobalt and one or more of the following<br>
compounds: selenium (0-10 ppm), MnO2 (0-0.5%) and NiO (0-30 ppm).<br>
FR-A-2 738 239 discloses a clear gray glass composition with a tint varying<br>
between greenish and bluish, which contains 0.25 a 0.60% iron, 10 to 40 ppm<br>
cobalt and 5 to 30 ppm selenium. The glass possesses a glass excitation purity<br>
not exceeding 6% and a selectivity of greater than 1.1.<br>
It is also known from WO-A-00/76928 that neutral gray glass can be obtained<br>
from compositions containing iron oxide (0.3-0.7%), selenium<br>
(1-15 ppm) and optionally cobalt oxide (0-15 ppm). The glass produced exhibits a<br>
standard color shift of less than 6.<br>
Automobile manufacturers are faced with ever greater requirements in terms<br>
of windows. Thus, they wish to have available colored glass which, in addition to<br>
its optical and energy properties, allows the perception of the color that an<br>
observer located outside the vehicle may have of the interior elements, such as<br>
the fabric of the seats or the dashboard, to be unmodified. The property of a glass<br>
not to impair vision is measured by the « color rendering index » which is defined<br><br>
in European Standard EN 410:1998. Thus, when the color rendering index is<br>
close to 100, there is no difference in coloration between the elements seen by the<br>
observer inside the passenger compartment and outside the latter<br>
One objective of the present invention is to provide a glass composition of<br>
the soda-lime-silicate type which has a very neutral coloration with a bluish, gray<br>
or bronze tint, an overall light transmission under illuminant A (TLA) compatible with<br>
a use as a front window of an automobile, in particular a windshield, and a<br>
satisfactory overall energy transmission (TE), this composition furthermore<br>
possessing a high color renderino index<br>
Another objective of the invention is to provide a glass composition that can<br>
be made into sheet on the surface of a bath of metal using the float glass<br>
technique, under oxidation-reduction conditions similar to those usually employed<br>
for a standard float glass and for a similar cost.<br>
These objectives are achieved according to the invention thanks to a glass<br>
composition of the soda-lime-silicate type, which comprises the constituents below<br>
within the following limits by weight:<br>
SiO2	64 - 75%<br>
AI2O3	0 - 5%<br>
B2O.3	0 - 5%<br>
CaO	5 - 15%<br>
MgO	0 - 5%<br>
Na2O	10 - 18%<br>
K2O	0 - 5%<br>
and the coloring agents below within the following limits by weight:<br>
Fe2O3 (total iron)	0.2 - 0.45%<br>
Se	2-8 ppm<br>
CoO	0 - 20 ppm<br>
NiO	0 - 80 ppm<br>
said agents satisfying the following relationship.<br>
0.7 
in which the NiO, Se, Fe3+, CoO and Fe2+ contents are expressed in ppm,<br>
Fe3+ being the content of ferric iron expressed in the form of Fe2O3 and Fe2+<br>
being the content of ferrous iron expressed in the form of FeO,<br><br>
and the composition having a redox varying from 0.28 to 0.5, an overall light<br>
transmission under illuminant A (TLA) greater than 65% and a selectivity (SE) of<br>
greater than 1.25, these being measured for a thickness of 3.85 mm.<br>
Within the context of the present invention, the selectivity SE is defined as<br>
being the ratio of the light transmission factor under illuminant A (TLA) to the<br>
energy transmission factor (TE) for a glass thickness of 3.85 mm.<br>
Likewise, the redox is defined by the ratio of the FeO content to the total iron<br>
content, expressed in the form of Fe2O3, the contents being expressed in<br>
percentages by weight.<br>
Hereafter, R1 denotes the ratio:<br>
(200 x NiO) + (5000 x Se) + (6 x Fe2O3) / (875 x CoO) + (24 x FeO).<br>
The glass composition according to the present invention possesses an<br>
excitation purity less than or equal to 2%, preferably less than 1%.<br>
In general, the glass composition is of neutral gray color and its tint is<br>
balanced by the respective contents of the coloring agents as indicated above.<br>
Control of the tint, defined by its dominant wavelength (λd), is made possible by<br>
keeping the coloring agents within the limits indicated above. Thus, when the value<br>
of the ratio of the aforementioned coloring agents is:<br>
less than 0.8, a blue tint (λd of around 490 to 500 nm) is obtained;<br>
between 0.8 and 1.25, the glass formed is gray without any particular tint;<br>
- greater than 1.25, a bronze tint (λd of around 540 to 560 nm) is obtained.<br>
It should be emphasized here the role played by the NiO, which allows the<br>
tint to be varied over a wide range, without however significantly reducing the light<br>
transmission, as Se and CoO may do. Furthermore, the NiO content used remains<br>
low, which makes it possible to reduce the risk of the NiO combining with sulfur-<br>
containing compounds, such as the sulfate used as glass refining agent, to form<br>
beads of nickel sulfide. The presence of these beads within the glass gives<br>
windows that have a tendency, after having undergone the toughening step, of<br>
breaking when they are exposed to sunlight for long periods.<br>
A first series of preferred compositions according to the invention makes it<br>
possible to obtain neutral gray glass having a purity of less than 1% and a color<br>
rendering index of at least 96. These compositions comprise the coloring agents<br>
below within the following limits by weight:<br>
Fe2O3 (total iron)	0.2 - 0.3%<br><br>
Se	2-8 ppm<br>
CoO	0 - 20 ppm<br>
NiO	0 - 5 ppm<br>
and the composition having a redox of greater than 0.4, preferably<br>
greater than 0.45.<br>
The particularly preferred glass compositions are devoid of NiO and<br>
comprise:<br>
Fe2O3 (total iron)	0.2 - 0.25%<br>
Se	4-7 ppm<br>
CoO	10-20 ppm.<br>
A second series of preferred compositions according to the invention makes<br>
it possible to obtain glass having a selectivity of greater than 1.3 and<br>
advantageously greater than 1.35. Such compositions make it possible to form<br>
automobile windows that satisfy the requirements relating to thermal comfort of<br>
persons in the passenger compartment and relating to light transmission. These<br>
compositions comprise the coloring agents below within the following limits by<br>
weight:<br>
Fe2O3 (total iron)	0.35 - 0.45%<br>
Se	2-8 ppm<br>
CoO	0-10ppm<br>
NiO	0 - 80 ppm<br>
and the composition having a redox of greater than or equal to 0.34.<br>
The particularly preferred glass compositions comprise:<br>
Fe2O3 (total iron)	0.39 - 0.45%<br>
Se	3-6 ppm<br>
CoO	0 - 6 ppm<br>
NiO	0-15 ppm.<br>
The glass composition according to the invention makes it possible to form<br>
glass having a high color rendering index, at least equal to 94, and more often<br>
than not greater than 96. This index, defined according to the EN410:1998<br>
standard, makes it possible to assess the variations in coloration through a<br>
window of the glass to be tested from control specimens of a given color that are<br>
illuminated by a reference illuminant (D65). The glass with an index greater than 90<br>
is considered as having a very good color rendering.<br><br>
In the glass according to the invention, the silica is generally<br>
maintained within very narrow limits for the following reasons: above about 75%,<br>
the viscosity of the glass and its ability to devitrify greatly increase, which makes it<br>
more difficult for the glass to melt and to flow on a bath of molten tin, while below<br>
64% the hydrolytic resistance of the glass rapidly decreases.<br>
This reduction in the hydrolytic resistance of the glass may be compensated,<br>
at least in part, by the introduction of AI2O3, but this oxide contributes to increasing<br>
its viscosity and reducing the transmission in the visible. Consequently, it is<br>
envisioned to use it only in a very small amount.<br>
The alkali metal oxides Na2O and K2O facilitate melting of the glass.<br>
K2O may be used up to about 5%, since above this the problem of the high cost of<br>
the composition arises. The sum of the Na2O and K2O contents, expressed as<br>
percentages by weight, is preferably equal to or greater than 13%.<br>
Alkaline-earth metal oxides play a key role in obtaining the properties of the<br>
glass according to the invention.<br>
As regards the oxide MgO, according to a first embodiment of the invention,<br>
its content is advantageously greater than 2%, especially for economic reasons.<br>
According to another embodiment, its content is less than 2%. This is<br>
because it has been demonstrated that limiting the MgO content to 2% has the<br>
effect of shifting the maximum in the FeO absorption band toward longer<br>
wavelengths, thus making it possible to increase the infrared absorbtivity without<br>
impairing the transmission in the visible. Complete elimination of MgO, which plays<br>
an important role in the viscosity, may be compensated for, at least in part, by<br>
increasing the content of Na2O and/or SiO2.<br>
BaO makes it possible to increase the light transmission, and it may be<br>
added to the composition according to the invention with a content of less than<br>
4%. This is because BaO has a much smaller effect than MgO and CaO on the<br>
viscosity of the glass. Within the context of the invention, the increase in BaO<br>
takes place essentially to the detriment of the alkali metal oxides, MgO and<br>
especially CaO. Any significant increase in BaO therefore contributes to increasing<br>
the viscosity of the glass, especially at low temperatures. In addition, introducing a<br>
high percentage of BaO substantially increases the cost of the composition.<br>
Preferably, the glass according to the invention contains no BaO. When it does<br>
contain BaO, its content is preferably between 0.5 and 3.5% by weight.<br><br>
Apart from complying with the limits defined above for the variation in<br>
the content of each alkaline-earth metal oxide, it is preferable in order to obtain the<br>
desired transmission properties to limit the sum of the percentages of MgO, CaO<br>
and BaO by weight to a value equal to or less than 14%<br>
The glass composition may furthermore include at least one optical<br>
absorption agent, such as CeO2, TiO2, V2O5 WO3 La2O3, etc. The total content of<br>
this (these) agent(s) is generally maintained at less than 1% by weight of the<br>
composition, and preferably less than 0.5%.<br>
The glass obtained from the compositions according to the invention may<br>
also contain up to 1% of other constituents provided by the impurities in the glass<br>
raw materials and/or by introducing recycled cullet into the glass batch and/or by<br>
using a refining agent (SO3, CI, Sb2O3, As2O3)<br>
The glass obtained from the compositions according to the invention may be<br>
produced under conditions that make it possible to achieve the desired degree of<br>
oxidation-reduction (redox), which remains however less than 0.5. Such glass may<br>
thus be produced in the presence of known refining agents, such as sulfates. To<br>
facilitate melting, and especially to make this mechanically useful, the glass matrix<br>
advantageously has a temperature, corresponding to a viscosity ŋ such that log<br>
ŋ = 2, which is less than 1500°C. More preferably, especially when it is desired to<br>
obtain the glass in the form of a glass ribbon using the float glass technique, the<br>
matrix has a temperature corresponding to the viscosity ŋ, expressed in poise,<br>
such that logŋ = 3.5 (denoted by Tiogŋ =35) and a liquidus temperature (denoted by<br>
Tliq) which satisfy the equation:<br>
Tiogŋ = 35- Tliq &gt; 20°C,<br>
and preferably the equation:<br>
Tlogŋ = 35 - Tliq &gt; 50°C.<br>
A better appreciation of the advantages of the present invention will be<br>
gained from the examples of glass compositions given below.<br>
In these examples, the values of the following properties, measured for a<br>
thickness of 3.85 mm, are indicated:<br>
•	the overall light transmission factor under illuminant A CTLA)<br>
•	the overall energy transmission factor (TE) integrated between 295 and<br>
2100 nm according to the ISO 9050 standard (Parry Moon, air mass 2);<br>
•	the selectivity (SE), defined as being the ratio TLA/TE;<br><br>
•	the dominant wavelength (λd)	under illuminant D65,<br>
•	the excitation purity (PD65) under illuminant D65; and<br>
•	the overall color rendering index (Ra) as defined in the EN410:1998<br>
standard (glass used in constructions: determination of light and solar<br>
characteristics of glazing).<br>
The light transmission (TLA), the dominant wavelength (λd) and the purity (P)<br>
were calculated using the 1931 CIE (Commission Internationale de I'Eclairage)<br>
calorimetric reference observer<br>
Each of the compositions given in the table was produced from the following<br>
glass matrix, the contents of which are expressed as percentages by weight, each<br>
being corrected in terms of silica in order to be adjusted to the total content of<br>
coloring agents added:<br>
SiO2	71.00%<br>
AI2O3	0.70%<br>
CaO	8.90%<br>
MgO	3.80%<br>
Na2O	14.10%<br>
K2O	0.10%.<br>
The temperatures Tlogŋ=2 and Tiogŋ=35, corresponding to the viscosities,<br>
expressed in poise, such that logŋ = 2 and logn - 3.5 respectively, together with<br>
the liquidus temperature Tliq are identical for all the glass compositions given<br>
(these being produced from the same glass matrix) and are the following:<br>
Tlogŋ=2	1410°C<br>
Tlogŋ=3 5	1100°C<br>
Tiiq	1060°C.<br>
The glass compositions shown in figures 1 to 40 are in accordance with the<br>
invention.<br>
The compositions of examples 41 to 44 are given as comparative examples.<br>
Examples 41 to 43 define compositions that contain a substantial quantity of CoO,<br>
NiO and Se respectively, and therefore that have a lower R1 ratio (example 41) or<br>
a higher R1 ratio (examples 42 and 43) than the compositions according to the<br>
invention. The composition of example 44 was produced under relatively reducing<br>
conditions (low redox value).<br><br>
Examples 1 to 40 according to the invention show that the use of iron oxide<br>
(in Fe2O3 and FeO form), CoO, NiO and Se coloring agents in proportions that<br>
satisfy the R1 ratio makes it possible to obtain glasses glasses that are very<br>
neutral (purity ≤ 2%) having a high color rendering index (&gt; 94) and a high<br>
selectivity (≥ 1.25) and that meet the optical constraints. The examples also show<br>
the very strong influence that small variations in the cobalt, nickel and selenium<br>
contents can have, allowing the dominant wavelength of the glass to be very finely<br>
controlled and the desired tint to be obtained, which may range from blue to<br>
bronze passing through gray tints.<br>
Examples 5, 16, 18, 21, 25 and 34 to 37 belong to the first series of<br>
compositions as defined above, which make it possible to obtain very neutral gray<br>
glass (purity ≤ 1%) having a color rendering index of at least 96.<br>
The compositions given in examples 1, 3, 4, 6, 8 to 12, 15, 20, 22, 26, 28 and<br>
31 to 32 are representative of the aforementioned second series, making it<br>
possible to form glass of high selectivity (SE ≥ 1.35).<br>
Any glass obtained from the compositions according to the invention is<br>
compatible with the usual techniques for manufacturing flat glass. The thickness of<br>
the glass ribbon obtained by sheeting out the molten glass on a bath of tin may be<br>
up to 20 mm, and in general this will vary between 0.8 and 10 mm.<br>
Window qlass (obtained by cutting the glass ribbon) may subsequently<br>
undergo a bending and/or enameling operation, especially when it is used for<br>
automobile windows.<br>
To produce windshields or side windows, the window glass is initially cut from<br>
a glass ribbon whose thickness generally varies between 3 and 5 millimeters. With<br>
these thicknesses, the glass ensures good thermal comfort. The windshields or<br>
side windows in question may be laminated, in which case they are formed from<br>
several glass sheets, at least one of which is obtained from the composition<br>
according to the invention. Preferably, these windows comprise at least one glass<br>
sheet having an overall light transmission under illuminant A (TLA) of at least 70%<br>
for a thickness of 3.85 mm.<br>
The windows falling wjthin the scope of the present invention may be<br>
subjected beforehand to surface treatments or may receive, for example, an<br>
organic coating, such as a polyurethane-based film with antilacerating properties,<br>
or a film that provides sealing should a window shatter.<br><br>
These windows may also be coated with at least one metal oxide<br>
layer obtained by high-temperature chemical deposition using pyrolysis or<br>
chemical vapor deposition (CVD) or vacuum deposition techniques<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

for the production of windows, characterized in that it comprises the<br>
constituents below within the following limits by weight:<br>
