				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td> The present invention relates to aircraft configuration with improved aerodynamic performance.<br>
This patent is referred to an aircraft configuration<br>
with high aerodynamic performance; in particular the<br>
aircraft according to the patent is designed like a<br>
high performance trainer with  secondary operational<br>
capabilities.<br>
Many aircraft have to be easily flown and must have<br>
peculiar dynamic characteristics in accordance with the<br>
mission to be carried out.<br>
Typical examples of the above include light aircraft<br>
for aerobatics, trainers and combat aircraft.<br>
These aircraft often have to flight at a high angle of<br>
attack (the angle between the aircraft and wind speed<br>
direction at any time) .<br>
It- is easy to understand that,  under these flight<br>
conditions,  the aircraft has to be very stable and<br>
easily controlled by the pilot, in order to maintain a<br>
safe attitude during flight.<br>
This stability is obtained using special  automatic<br>
equipment  able ,to  generate  forces  and moments  to<br>
counterbalance undesirable flight attitudes.<br>
While the aircraft stability along the pitch axis can<br>
be controlled optimising the static margin and time-to-<br><br>
double amplitude, the presence of lateral-directional instability (on "roll" and "yaw" axes) at high angles of attack can be difficult to control even using highly sophisticated Flight Control Systems.<br>
It is therefore necessary to maximise the aircraft lateral-directional stability up to high angles of attack in order to allow aircraft control/agility and to avoid flight departures and spins.<br>
Usually and in particular lately, attempt has been done by simply modifying the fuselage aerodynamic shaping and other aircraft parts. Up to now those attempts have not lead to successful results.<br>
In the frame of the requirements listed above, one of the goal of this patent is, therefore, to avoid the mentioned problems and, in particular, the problem relevant to an aircraft configuration with improved aerodynamic performance, able to optimise the aircraft behaviour especially during high angle of attack flights.<br>
Another goal of this patent is to present an aircraft configuration with improved aerodynamic performance, able to reduce buffet effects typical of low aspect ratio wings with thin profile and variable camber. Another goal of this patent is to realise an aircraft configuration with high aerodynamic performance, able<br><br>
to avoid successfully, the loss of lateral-directional stability and the negative effects generated by the engine flow next to the fuselage side wall and the horizontal tail, as far as drag, stability and longitudinal control are concerned.<br>
An additional goal of this patent is to realise an aircraft configuration with improved aerodynamic performance, able to recover from spin, optimising, in general, the aircraft behaviour at high angles of attack.<br>
These  and  other  goals  are  met  by  an  aircraft configuration . with improved aerodynamic performance, according to claim 1, to which we refer to. Profitably,  the aircraft subject of this patent is designed,  in particular,  like a trainer with high performance and secondary operational capabilities. The configuration includes a twin engine "formula" and it is characterised by the presence of a range of very peculiar structural details.<br>
The twin-seat cabin (in tandem) with interconnected flight controls is coupled with, a forebody with basically circular and variable section, characterised by low aspect ratio, optimised for high angles of attack flights. In this space a radar for the aircraft operational version can be easily integrated.<br><br>
The forebody shape and dimensions are optimised in order to reduce its vortex interference on the aircraft aerodynamic characteristics at mid/high angles of attack; the mentioned characteristics allow to reduce the directional asymmetries at high angles of attack, typical of forebody with circular or elliptical section.<br>
Moreover the wing profile is different from the standard wing profiles, in order to integrate a system able to minimise the buffet effects, typical of low aspect ratio wings with thin profile and variable camber.<br>
The aerodynamic design includes also a LEX (Leading Edge Extension) vortex control device, properly sized, in order to symmetrize the LEX vortex bursting at mid/high angles of attack, as the symmetric vortex bursting allows to keep the lateral-directional stability and the aircraft control at mid/high angles of attack.<br>
The training aircraft under this patent has, at least one engine air intake able to guarantee the performance and a proper fluid-dynamic interface with the engine; the design does not foresee the integration of a typical diverter on the upper lip of an air intake, integrated with a LEX.<br><br>
Finally, the horizontal tail staggering allows to get a decrease  in  the  aerodynamic drag produced by the fuselage  afterbody,  to  optimise  the  aircraft  spin behaviour  and to  improve  the  aircraft  aerodynamic design for high angles of attack manoeuvres.

the aircraft configuration designed accordingly to this patent.<br>
Making  reference  to  the  mentioned  pictures,  an aircraft, in particular a trainer aircraft, having a configuration with improved aerodynamic performance, accordingly to this patent, is generally indicated with reference 10.<br>
The aircraft 10 includes a fuselage 12, having an upper side wall 14 and a lower side wall 16, and two wings, respectively a right wing 18 and a left wing 20, fitted to the fuselage 12.<br>
The right wing 18 has the tip 22, while the left wing 20 has the tip 24.<br>
The aircraft 10 features also a rudder 34, fitted to the vertical fin 38 and a horizontal stabiliser 44 having a right horizontal stabiliser 26 and a left horizontal stabiliser 28 and relevant tips 30, 32. In preferred or realising, but not limiting forms of the  patent,  as  already mentioned  above,  the  type configuration is a twin-engine formula and foresees two air intakes 46 for the engines 48, with relative engine nozzles 60.<br>
Finally, in the fuselage forebody area 52, in which a radar for the aircraft 10 operational version could be integrated, a two in tandem pilot cockpit 54 is<br><br>
installed, with interconnected flight controls, protected by a windshield 62. A probe 58 could be foreseen, in order to carry out in flight refuelling for the aircraft 10.<br>
With reference to pictures 2 and 3, each wing 18, 20 of the aircraft 10 presents outer ailerons 56 and take-off and landing double slotted flaps 64, integrated in the trailing edge 70 of each wing 18, 20, and other devices for wing camber optimisation (leading edge droops) 66, integrated in the wing leading edge 68. Their profile is shaped following a particular geometry, on the basis of the general aerodynamic design mentioned in this description.<br>
In particular, the technical characteristics of the aircraft 10, aimed to obtain high aerodynamic performance and flight stability, according to this patent, are as follows.<br>
First of all, the aerodynamic design is characterised by the presence of a LVC ("LEX Vortex Controller") device to control the LEX ("Leading Edge Extension") vortex at mid/high angles of attack (ref. 72, picture 1) .<br>
The LEX, with gothic platform equal to 6,4% of the reference wing gross area (as per this patent) , allows vortex lift generation at high angles of attack and LEX<br><br>
design is further refined integrating the LVC  ("LEX Vortex Controller") at its tip, in order to ensure the vortex symmetric bursting at high angles of attack for sideslip  attitudes  and  prevent  loss  of  lateral-directional stability.<br>
The LEX vortex controller sizing 72 depends on the front LEX size and, in any case, the bigger the LEX is the higher the LVC must be; the tolerance can be defined by the ratio between the LEX area and the height of the corresponding LVC. The design point of this ratio is equal to 2,35 m and the applicable<br>
tolerance range varies from 100% greater than, or 200% of, to 50% less than, or 50% of, the ratio from the design point.<br>
The fuselage forebody ,52 shape of the aircraft 10 and its  dimensions are even' more optimised in order to reduce  its  vortex  interference  on  the  aerodynamic characteristics of the aircraft 10 at mid/high angles of attack; the mentioned characteristics allow also to reduce the directional asymmetries at high angles of attack, typical for the forebody with standard circular or elliptical sections.<br>
The forebody 52 of the aircraft 10, according to the patent, shows a range of forebody sections with different geometry starting from the apex 74 up to the forebody edge merging with the LEX apex.<br><br>
An exemplifying and preferred, but not limiting way, of the geometric shape and of the sequence of sections with different geometry, between the apex 74 and a section referred to the quote 76 (positioned more or less at the beginning of the twin-seat cabin 54) , is presented, in sequence, at pictures 8-17, from which is inferable that from a roughly low aspect ratio circular section (pictures 8-11) a chined section is got (pictures 12-17).<br>
From the mentioned pictures is clear the shift of the forebody 52 from the longitudinal axis K, from the apex 74 up to the reference section presented in picture 17. In particular, according to a preferred fprm of the patent, the ratio between the length of the forebody 52, starting from the apex 74 up to the section along the XVII-XVII  line  (reference L),  and the  average between the lengths A and B of the two axes of the section (section presented in picture 17), presents a value of 1,873, with a tolerance equal to ±10%. The structural peculiarity and its effect on the flight conditions  come  out  from  the  combination  of  the parameter mentioned above (plus or minus the tolerance, if any) and the sequence of the forebody 52 sections, from the apex 74 of the aircraft 10 up to the reference section along XVII-XVII line.<br><br>
In picture 18 is also shown in detail an engine air intake, indicated as item 46, which contributes to guarantee the performance of aircraft 10, above all as far as the fluid-dynamic interface with the relevant jet engine is concerned.<br>
The air intake 46 shows a variable leading edge radius optimised in the lower part in order to reduce the engine face flow distortion at high angles of attack and in the side part in order to reduce the transonic spillage drag.<br>
In particular, the inner lip average leading edge radius 76A is equal to 7 mm, while the lower lip average leading edge radius 78 is equal to 17,5 mm and that of the outer lip 80 is equal to 14 mm, so that the capture area of the air intake is about 0,322 m2, and the throat area of the air intake is about 0,257 m2 and the engine face area is about 0,273 m2 (this values are referred to one air intake).<br>
The air intake 46 is diverteless on the upper side of each air intake side and integrated with a LEX, thanks to the peculiar ratio between LEX length and shape; effectively the LEX acts as a shield at high angles of attack.<br>
The air intake can foresee also the presence of two additional blow indoors (not showed in the pictures),<br><br>
positioned on the upper wing-body junction between wing 18, 20 and fuselage 12, which open when the pressure in the duct is lower than pressure on the upper wing-body junction, thanks to pre-loaded springs integrated in the blow indoor hinges.<br>
These blow indoors aim is to reduce, when they open, the local angles of attack on the air intake lips 46 at high angles of attack, reducing the air mass flow quantity passing through the above mentioned air intake 46.<br>
One of the characteristics that guarantee the high performance, the stability and the aerodynamic structure of the aircraft 10, is the staggered tails 44 and 38. They allow to reduce the aerodynamic drag generated by the fuselage afterbody, to optimise the spin behaviour of the aircraft 10 and to improve its whole aerodynamic design for high angles of attack flights.<br>
The vertical fin with trapezoidal platform includes the rudder 34 and is coupled to the wing. This means that the leading edge of the rudder, indicated as item 36 in picture 1, overlapping the trailing edges 70 of each wing 18, 20, in order to allow the recovery from the spin and to optimise the behaviour of the aircraft 10 at high angles of attack.<br><br>
The horizontal tail with trapezoidal platform, is moved by two independent actuators which allow its symmetric<br>
and asymmetric deflection. The horizontal tail presents a hinge axis, indicated as item 86 in picture 2, which is oriented, on the right and on the left, of about 7,5°, from a lateral axis 88, in order to optimise the hinge and the inertial moments.<br>
The staggered tails can be further characterised by a tolerance referred to the ratio between quote C, showed in picture 1 and defined as the distance between the apex of the vertical fin root chord and the apex of the horizontal tail root chord 44, and the tail arm, equal to 4181 mm; it follows that the reference ratio given above is equal to 1932/4181 mm = 0,462, with an applicable tolerance equal to 10%.<br>
Also the wing profile is modified and optimised in comparison with traditional trainer aircraft, in order to reduce the "buffet" effect, considering the characteristics of a low aspect ratio wing with thin airfoil and variable camber.<br>
According to the patent, on the contrary, a wing 18, 20 with trapezoidal platform and mid aspect ratio (AR=4) is used, characterised by the presence of a saw tooth (showed as S in picture 2) at 67,5% of the gross wing span; the modification, in comparison with standard<br><br>
wings, is first of all related to the leading edge radius, showed as R in picture 6 which was circular (prior art) and now becomes triangular, in order to optimise the stagnation point position, in presence of the leading edge 68 and of the "Leading Edge Droops" 66 deflected at mid angles of attack.<br>
As clearly results from picture 6, which shows an enlarged section along VI-VI line of picture 2, each wing 18, 20 presents a variable camber profile, both along the leading edge 66 ("Leading Edge Droop") and along the trailing edge 70, near the ailerons 56. The ailerons are scheduled only in transonic regime, to have a camber reduction in order to reduce compressibility effects.<br>
Quantitatively, the design point of the chord percentage extension of the leading edge 68 is equal to 0,36%, with a tolerance between +0,5% and -0,2% from the nominal value, while the design point of the gross wing span at which the chord extension is applied, in comparison with the standard solutions, is equal to 8,2%, with a tolerance between +10% and -5% from the nominal value.<br>
Other characteristics of the aircraft 10 include the fuselage 12, which, in the afterbody 16, foresees the integration of the engine nozzles and the presence of a<br><br>
fuselage tail, indicated as item 90 in picture 3.<br>
Also the area near the engine nozzles is optimised in<br>
order to reduce the negative effects, in terms of drag<br>
and longitudinal stability/control,  generated by the<br>
engine flow next to the fuselage side wall 12 and the<br>
horizontal tail 44.<br>
The aircraft 10 features also a tricycle landing gear,<br>
including a nose landing gear and a main landing gear.<br>
The nose landing gear is a leg strut, with four doors<br>
closing the bay, and backside retraction.<br>
The main landing gear has frontside retraction in order<br>
to allow fuselage belly loads installation.<br>
The aircraft 10 under this patent fits an automatic<br>
flight  control  system  ("Fly  By  Wire"),  digital<br>
quadruplex redundant,  which allows to optimise the<br>
performance and the flight qualities; the system allows<br>
to improve the flight safety limiting, automatically,<br>
flight regimes, which could be uncomfortable to the<br>
pilot  or  could  lead  to  lose  control  ("Carefree<br>
Handling").<br>
From the above description the characteristics of the<br>
aircraft:  configuration  with   improved  aerodynamic<br>
performance,  subject to  this patent,  are resulting<br>
clear, such as its advantages.<br>
It is also clear that several other modifications can<br><br>
be applied to the structure of the aircraft in subject, without exceeding the novelties included in the concept of the patent. It is also clear that, in applying the patent, materials, shapes and dimensions of the above mentioned details could vary in compliance with the requirements and the same details could be replaced with other details having the same technical characteristics.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
