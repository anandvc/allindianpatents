				<td>A METHOD FOR QoS GUARANTEES IN A MULTILAYER STRUCTURE<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a wireless mobile<br>
communication system, and more particularly, to a method in<br>
which a terminal (or user equipment) processes data in a<br>
wireless mobile communication system.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
A radio protocol based on the 3rd Generation<br>
Partnership Project (3GPP) radio access network standard is<br>
divided into a first (LI) layer, a second (L2) layer, and a<br>
third (L3) layer based on the lower three layers of the<br>
Open System Interconnection (OSI) reference model. The<br>
second layer of the radio protocol includes a Medium Access<br>
Control (MAC) layer, a Radio Link Control (RLC) layer and a<br>
Packet Data Convergence Protocol (PDCP) layer. The third<br>
layer includes a Radio Resource Control (RRC) layer at the<br>
bottom of the third layer.<br>
The RLC layer is responsible for guaranteeing Quality<br>
of Service (QoS) of each Radio Bearer (RB) and performing<br>
data transmission according to the QoS. The RLC layer<br>
includes one or two RLC entities for each RB in order to<br>
guarantee QoS specific to the RB. The RLC layer also<br>
<br>
provides three RLC modes, a Transparent Mode (TM), an<br>
Unacknowledged Mode (UM), and an Acknowledged Mode (AM), in<br>
order to support various QoS.<br>
The PDCP layer is located above the RLC layer and can<br>
perform header compression on data transmitted using IP<br>
packets such as IPv4 or IPv6 packets. The PDCP layer is<br>
present only in a packet-switched domain and includes one<br>
PDCP entity per RB.<br>
The RRC layer sets a variety of operating methods,<br>
parameters, and characteristics of channels associated with<br>
the first and second layers of the radio protocol in order<br>
to satisfy QoS. Specifically, the RRC layer determines<br>
which header compression method would be used at the PDCP<br>
layer and determines an operating mode, a RLC PDU size, and<br>
values of various protocol parameters which are used for<br>
the RLC layer.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
TECHNICAL PROBLEM<br>
QoS is the quality of services transmitted and<br>
received through a wireless mobile communication system.<br>
Typical factors that affect QoS include delay, error ratio,<br>
and bitrate. QoS of a service is determined appropriately<br>
according to the type of the service.<br>
In the case of real-time services such as VoIP or<br>
streaming services using a wireless mobile communication<br>
system, problems such as video interruption or audio<br>
distortion occur if transfer delay is significant. That is,<br>
even though data is received by the counterpart, the<br>
quality is lowered if it takes more than a specific time to<br>
transfer the data to the counterpart. Indeed, data<br>
received after a specific time has elapsed is mostly not<br>
used by an application. Accordingly, attempting to<br>
transmit a data block, whose transfer time has exceeded the<br>
allowed transfer time, or storing such a data block causes<br>
overhead and waste of resources.<br>
The following is a more detailed description with<br>
reference to the PDCP layer. Data units received from the<br>
outside of the L2 layer are stored in a buffer of the PDCP<br>
layer. The data units are stored in the PDCP layer until<br>
they are received by the counterpart. However, if<br>
transmission of data blocks associated with a PDCP SDU is<br>
delayed at a lower layer, the time duration during which<br>
the PDCP SDU must stay in the buffer of the PDCP layer<br>
increases. Specifically, the capacity of the buffer may<br>
become insufficient if the amount of data is large, if data<br>
is constantly received from the outside, or if transmission<br>
of some PDCP SDUs is kept delayed. Especially, if the<br>
buffer is full, new data received from the outside is<br>
immediately discarded since there is no space in which to<br>
store the new data. This directly affects the QoS.<br>
An object of the present invention devised to solve<br>
the above problems of the conventional technologies lies in<br>
providing a data processing method that guarantees Quality<br>
of Service (QoS) and efficiently manages data in a wireless<br>
mobile communication system which uses a multilayer<br>
structure.<br>
Another object of the present invention devised to<br>
solve the problem lies in providing a method in which a<br>
specific protocol layer of a User Equipment (UE) or a base<br>
station decides data to be discarded (or deleted) and<br>
instructs a lower layer to discard the data.<br>
A further object of the present invention devised to<br>
solve the problem lies in providing a method in which a<br>
lower layer discards data when a specific protocol layer of<br>
a UE or a base station has instructed the lower layer to<br>
discard the data.<br>
Objects of the present invention are not limited to<br>
those described above and other objects will be clearly<br>
understood by those skilled in the art from the following<br>
description.<br>

with the discard of the second data block to the lower<br>
layer. Preferably, the upper layer is a RRC layer.<br>
Preferably, the lower layer is a RLC layer. Preferably,<br>

first data block at a particular protocol layer when<br>
receiving the first data block from an upper layer;<br>
transferring a second data block including the first data<br>
block to a lower layer at a particular protocol layer;<br>
discarding the first and second data blocks present in the<br>
particular protocol layer if the timer expires; and<br>
transferring information associated with the discard of the<br>
second data block to the lower layer. Preferably, the<br>
upper layer is a RRC layer. Preferably, the lower layer is<br>
a RLC layer. Preferably, the specific protocol layer is a<br>
PDCP layer.<br>
In another aspect of the present invention, provided<br>
herein is a method of processing data by a user equipment<br>
or a base station in a wireless mobile communication system,<br>
the method including the steps of receiving a data block<br>
from an upper layer, receiving an instruction to discard<br>
the data block from the upper layer, and discarding the<br>
data block at a particular protocol layer if no part of the<br>
data block has been transmitted.<br>
ADVANTAGEOUS EFFECTS<br>

following advantages.<br>
First, it is possible to guarantee QoS and to<br>
efficiently manage data in a wireless mobile communication<br>
system which uses a multilayer structure.<br>
Second, a specific protocol layer of a User Equipment<br>
(UE) or a base station can decide data to be discarded (or<br>
deleted) and instruct a lower layer to discard the data.<br>
Third, a lower layer can discard data when a specific<br>
protocol layer of a UE or a base station has instructed the<br>
lower layer to discard the data.<br>
Advantages of the present invention are not limited<br>
to those described above and other advantages will be<br>
clearly understood by those skilled in the art from the<br>
following description.<br>

MODE FOR INVENTION<br>
The above and other configurations, operations, and<br>
features of the present invention will be easily understood<br>
from the embodiments of the invention described below with<br>
reference to the accompanying drawings. The embodiments<br>
described below are examples wherein technical features of<br>
the invention are applied to an Evolved Universal Mobile<br>
Telecommunications System (E-UMTS).<br>
FIG. 1 shows a network structure of the E-UMTS to<br>
which an embodiment of the present invention is applied.<br>
The E-UMTS system is an evolved version of the conventional<br>
WCDMA UMTS system and basic standardization thereof is in<br>
progress under the 3rd Generation Partnership Project<br>
(3GPP) . The E-UMTS is also referred to as a Long Term<br>
Evolution (LTE) system. For details of the technical<br>
specifications of the UMTS and E-UMTS, reference can be<br>
made to Release 7 and Release 8 of "3rd Generation<br>
Partnership Project; Technical Specification Group Radio<br>
Access Network".<br>
As shown in FIG. 1, the E-UMTS mainly includes a User<br>
Equipment (UE), base stations (or eNBs or eNode Bs), and an<br>
Access Gateway (AG) which is located at an end of a network<br>
(E-UTRAN) and which is connected to an external network.<br>
Generally, an eNB can simultaneously transmit multiple data<br>
streams for a broadcast service, a multicast service,<br>
and/or a unicast service. AGs can be divided into AGs<br>
responsible for processing user traffic and AGs responsible<br>
for processing control traffic. Here, an AG for processing<br>
new user traffic and an AG for processing control traffic<br>
can communicate with each other using a new interface. One<br>
or more cells are present for one eNB. An interface for<br>
transmission of user traffic or control traffic can be used<br>
between eNBs. A Core Network (CN) may include an AG and<br>
network nodes for user registration of UEs. An interface<br>
for discriminating between the E-UTRAN and the CN can be<br>
used. The AG manages mobility of a UE on a Tracking Area<br>
(TA) basis. One TA includes a plurality of cells. When<br>
the UE has moved from a specific TA to another TA, the UE<br>
notifies the AG that the TA where the UE is located has<br>
been changed.<br>
FIG. 2 illustrates a network structure of an Evolved<br>
Universal Terrestrial Radio Access Network (E-UTRAN) system<br>
which is a mobile communication system to which the<br>
embodiment of the present invention is applied. The E-<br>
UTRAN system is an evolved version of the conventional<br>
UTRAN system. The E-UTRAN includes base stations (eNBs),<br>
which are connected through X2 interfaces. Each eNB is<br>
connected to User Equipments (UEs) through a radio<br>
interface and is connected to an Evolved Packet Core (EPC)<br>
through an SI interface.<br>
FIGs. 3A and 3B illustrate the configurations of a<br>
control plane and a user plane of a radio interface<br>
protocol between a UE and a UMTS Terrestrial Ratio Access<br>
Network (UTRAN) based on the 3GPP radio access network<br>
standard. The radio interface protocol is divided<br>
horizontally into a physical layer, a data link layer, and<br>
a network layer and vertically into a user plane for data<br>
information transmission and a control plane for signaling.<br>
The protocol layers of FIGs. 3A and 3B can be divided into<br>
a Ll layer (first layer) , a L2 layer (second layer), and a<br>
L3 layer (third layer) based on the lower three layers of<br>
the Open System Interconnection (OSI) reference model<br>
widely known in communication systems.<br>
The control plane is a passage through which control<br>
messages that a UE and a network use in order to manage<br>
calls are transmitted. The user plane is a passage through<br>
which data (e.g., voice data or Internet packet data)<br>
generated at an application layer is transmitted. The<br>
following is a detailed description of the layers of the<br>
radio protocol control and user planes.<br>
The physical layer, which is the first layer,<br>
provides an information transfer service to an upper layer<br>
using a physical channel. The physical layer is connected<br>
to a Media Access Control (MAC) layer, located above the<br>
physical layer, through a transport channel. Data is<br>
transferred between the MAC layer and the physical layer<br>
through the transport channel. Data transfer between<br>
different physical layers, specifically between the<br>
respective physical layers of transmitting and receiving<br>
sides, is performed through the physical channel. The<br>
physical channel is modulated according to the Orthogonal<br>
Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) method, using time<br>
and frequencies as radio resources.<br>
The MAC layer of the second layer provides a service<br>
to a Radio Link Control (RLC) layer, located above the MAC<br>
layer, through a logical channel. The RLC layer of the<br>
second layer supports reliable data transfer. The<br>
functions of the RLC layer may also be implemented through<br>
internal functional blocks of the MAC layer. In this case,<br>
the RLC layer need not be provided. A PDCP layer of the<br>
second layer performs a header compression function to<br>
reduce unnecessary control information in order to<br>
efficiently transmit IP packets such as IPv4 or IPv6<br>
packets in a radio interval with a relatively narrow<br>
bandwidth.<br>
A Radio Resource Control (RRC) layer located at the<br>
bottom of the third layer is defined only in the control<br>
plane and is responsible for control of logical, transport,<br>
and physical channels in association with configuration,<br>
re-configuration and release of Radio Bearers (RBs). The<br>
RB is a service that the second layer provides for data<br>
communication between the UE and the UTRAN. To accomplish<br>
this, the RRC layer of the UE and the RRC layer of the<br>
network exchange RRC messages. The UE is in a RRC<br>
connected mode if a RRC connection has been established<br>
between the RRC layer of the radio network and the RRC<br>
layer of the UE. Otherwise, the UE is in a RRC idle mode.<br>
A Non-Access Stratum (NAS) layer located above the<br>
RRC layer performs functions such as session management and<br>
mobility management.<br>
One cell of the eNB is set to provide a bandwidth<br>
such as 1.25, 2.5, 5, 10, or 20MHz to provide a downlink or<br>
uplink transmission service to UEs. Here, different cells<br>
may be set to provide different bandwidths.<br>
Downlink transport channels for transmission of data<br>
from the network to the UE include a Broadcast Channel<br>
(BCH) for transmission of system information, a Paging<br>
Channel (PCH) for transmission of paging messages, and a<br>
downlink Shared Channel (SCH) for transmission of user<br>
traffic or control messages. User traffic or control<br>
messages of a downlink multicast or broadcast service may<br>
be transmitted through a downlink SCH and may also be<br>
transmitted through a downlink multicast channel (MCH).<br>
Uplink transport channels for transmission of data from the<br>
UE to the network include a Random Access Channel (RACH)<br>
for transmission of initial control messages and an uplink<br>
SCH for transmission of user traffic or control messages.<br>
Logical channels, which are located above the<br>
transport channels and are mapped to the transport channels,<br>
include a Broadcast Control Channel (BCCH), a Paging<br>
Control Channel (PCCH), a Common Control Channel (CCCH), a<br>
Multicast Control Channel (MCCH), and a Multicast Traffic<br>
Channel (MTCK).<br>
FIG. 4 illustrates an example of a physical channel<br>
structure used in an E-UMTS system. A physical channel<br>
includes a plurality of subframes on the time axis and a<br>
plurality of subcarriers on the frequency axis. Here, one<br>
subframe includes a plurality of symbols on the time axis.<br>
One subframe includes a plurality of resource blocks and<br>
one resource block includes a plurality of symbols and a<br>
plurality of subcarriers. Each subframe can use specific<br>
subcarriers of a specific symbol (e.g., a first symbol) of<br>
the subframe for a Physical Downlink Control Channel<br>
(PDCCH) (i.e., a L1/L2 control channel). A L1/L2 control<br>
information transmission region and a data transmission<br>
region are shown in FIG. 4. The Evolved Universal Mobile<br>
Telecommunications System (E-UMTS), which is currently<br>
under discussion, uses 10ms radio frames, each including 10<br>
subframes. Each subframe includes two consecutive slots,<br>
each of which is 0.5ms long. One subframe includes<br>
multiple OFDM symbols. Some (for example, the first<br>
symbol) of the OFDM symbols can be used to transmit L1/L2<br>
control information. A Transmission Time Interval (TTI),<br>
which is a unit time during which data is transmitted, is<br>
lms.<br>
The eNB and the UE transmit and receive most data<br>
other than a specific control signal or specific service<br>
data through a PDSCH which is a physical channel by using a<br>
DL-SCH which is a transport channel. Information<br>
indicating which PDSCH data is transmitted to a UE (one or<br>
a plurality of UEs) or how the UEs receive and decode PDSCH<br>
data is included in a PDSCH which is a physical channel,<br>
and then transmitted.<br>
For example, let us assume that a specific PDCCH has<br>
been CRC-masked with a Radio Network Temporary Identity<br>
(RNTI) "A" and an information associated with data to be<br>
transmitted is transmitted through a specific subframe by<br>
using a radio resource (e.g., a frequency position) "B" and<br>
a transmit format information (e.g., transmit block size,<br>
modulation scheme, coding information, etc) "C" . Under<br>
this assumption, one or more UEs in a cell monitor the<br>
PDCCH using their own RNTI information. And, if one or<br>
more specific UEs contain the RNTI ,VA", , the specific UEs<br>
read the PDCCH and receive a PDSCH indicated by "B" and "C"<br>
in the received PDCCH information at a corresponding time.<br>
FIG. 5 is a block diagram of a PDCP layer used in an<br>
E-UMTS system. This block diagram illustrates functional<br>
blocks that may differ from actual implementations. The<br>
PDCP layer is not limited to a specific implementation.<br>
As shown in FIG. 5, the PDCP layer is located at the<br>
top of the L.2 structure and is generally connected to a<br>
device such as a computer at an upper side of the PDCP<br>
layer and exchanges IP packets with the device.<br>
Accordingly, the PDCP layer is responsible for primarily<br>
storing IP packets received from the outside.<br>
A PDCP entity is connected to a RRC or a user<br>
application at an upper side of the PDCP entity and is<br>
connected to a RLC layer at a lower side of the PDCP entity.<br>
Data which the PDCP entity exchanges with an upper layer is<br>
referred to as a "PDCP SDU".<br>
One PDCP entity includes transmitting and receiving<br>
sides as shown in FIG. 5. The transmitting side of the<br>
PDCP entity shown at a left side of FIG. 5 constructs a PDU<br>
from a SDU received from an upper layer or from control<br>
information internally generated at the PDCP entity and<br>
transmits the PDU to a peer PDCP entity of a receiving side.<br>
The receiving side shown at the right side of FIG. 5<br>
extracts a PDCP SDU or control information from a PDCP PDU<br>
received from a peer PDCP entity of a transmitting side.<br>
As described above, PDUs generated at a PDCP entity<br>
of the transmitting side are divided into two types, data<br>
and control PDUs. The PDCP data PDU is a data block that<br>
the PDCP creates by processing a SDU received from an upper<br>
layer. The PDCP control is a data block that the PDCP<br>
internally creates to transfer a control information to a<br>
peer entity.<br>
The PDCP data PDU is created at RBs of both a user<br>
plane and a control plane. However, some functions of the<br>
PDCP are selectively applied depending on which plane is<br>
used. That is, a header compression function is applied<br>
only to user plane data. An integrity protection function<br>
among security functions is applied only to control plane<br>
data. The security functions also include a ciphering<br>
function for data security. The ciphering function is<br>
applied to both user plane and control plane data.<br>
The PDCP control PDU is generated only at the control<br>
plane RB. The PDCP control PDU is classified mainly into<br>
two types, one being associated with a PDCP status report<br>
for notifying the transmitting side of the status of a PDCP<br>
reception buffer, the other being associated with a Header<br>
Compression (HC) feedback packet for notifying a header<br>
compressor of the status of a header decompressor.<br>
FIG. 6 is a block diagram of an AM entity of a RLC<br>
layer used in an E-UMTS system. This block diagram<br>
illustrates functional blocks that may differ from actual<br>
implementations. The RLC layer is not limited to a<br>
specific implementation.<br>
Although the RLC layer has three modes, TM, UM and AM,<br>
TM and UM entities are not illustrated since the TM entity<br>
performs almost no function at the RLC layer and the UM<br>
entity is similar to the AM entity except that it has no<br>
retransmission function.<br>
The UM RLC layer transmits each PDU to the receiving<br>
side by attaching a PDU header including a Sequence Number<br>
(SN) to the PDU to notify the receiving side of which PDU<br>
has been lost during transmission. Due to this function,<br>
at the user plane, the UM RLC is mainly responsible for<br>
transmitting broadcast/multicast data or transmitting<br>
real-time packet data such as voice (e.g., VoIP) or<br>
streaming data of a Packet Service (PS) domain. At the<br>
control plane, the UM RLC is responsible for transmitting a<br>
RRC message which does not require acknowledgement among<br>
RRC messages that would be transmitted to a specific UE or<br>
a specific UE group in a cell.<br>
Similar to the UM RLC, the AM RLC constructs a PDU by<br>
attaching a PDU header including a SN when constructing the<br>
PDU. However, unlike the UM RLC, the receiving side<br>
acknowledges a PDU transmitted by the transmitting side at<br>
the AM RLC. The reason why the receiving side acknowledges<br>
each PDU transmitted by the transmitting side at the AM RLC<br>
is to request that the transmitting side should retransmit<br>
a PDU that the AM RLC has not received. This<br>
retransmission function is the most significant feature of<br>
the AM RLC. That is, the purpose of the AM RLC is to<br>
guarantee error-free data transmission through<br>
retransmission. Due to this purpose, the AM RLC is mainly-<br>
responsible in the user plane for transmitting non-real-<br>
time packet data such as TCP/IP of the PS domain and is<br>
responsible in the control plane for transmitting a RRC<br>
message that must need reception acknowledgment resposonse<br>
among RRC messages transmitted to a specific UE in the cell.<br>
In terms of directionality, the UM RLC and AM RLC<br>
differ in that the UM RLC is used for unidirectional<br>
communication whereas the AM RLC is used for bidirectional<br>
communication due to the presence of feedback from the<br>
receiving side. In terms of structural aspects, the UM RLC<br>
and AM RLC differ in that one UM RLC entity has either a<br>
transmission or reception structure whereas one AM RLC<br>
entity includes both transmitting and receiving sides.<br>
The AM RLC is complicated due to the retransmission<br>
function. For managing retransmission, the AM RLC includes<br>
a retransmission buffer in addition to<br>
transmission/reception buffers and uses<br>
transmission/reception windows for flow control and<br>
performs a variety of functions as follows. The<br>
transmitting side performs polling to request that a<br>
receiving side of a peer reception provide status<br>
information. The receiving side provides a status report<br>
to report a buffer status of the receiving side to a peer<br>
RLC entity of a transmitting side. The receiving side<br>
constructs a status PDU carrying status information. To<br>
support these functions, the AM RLC requires a variety of<br>
protocol parameters, status variables and timers. PDUs<br>
used to control data transmission at the AM RLC such as a<br>
status report or status information are referred to as<br>
"control PDUs" and PDUs used to transfer user data are<br>
referred to as "data PDUs".<br>
However, at the AM RLC, a RLC data PDU is<br>
specifically classified into an AMD PDU and an AMD PDU<br>
segment. Each AMD PDU segment includes part of data<br>
belonging to the AMD PDU. In the LTE, the maximum size of<br>
a data block that the UE transmits is changed at each<br>
transmission. Accordingly, when the AM RLC entity of the<br>
transmitting side receives a negative acknowledgement from<br>
an AM RLC entity of the receiving side after constructing<br>
and transmitting a 200-byte AMD PDU at a certain time, the<br>
200-byte AMD PDU cannot be retransmitted by the AM RLC<br>
entity of the transmitting side without alteration if the<br>
maximum transmittable data block size is 100 bytes. Here,<br>
the AM RLC entity of the transmitting side uses AMD PDU<br>
segments which are small units into which the corresponding<br>
AMD PDU is divided. In this procedure, the AM RLC entity<br>
of the transmitting side divides the AMD PDU into AMD PDU<br>
segments and transmits the AMD PDU segments over a<br>
plurality of time intervals and the AM RLC entity of the<br>
receiving side reconstructs the received AMD PDU segments<br>
into an AMD PDU.<br>
The functions of the RLC entity can be considered<br>
those of Segmentation and Reassembly (SAR) in their<br>
entirety. That is, the RLC of the transmitting site is<br>
responsible for adjusting the size of a MAC PDU indicated<br>
by a MAC entity, which is a lower entity, and RLC SDUs<br>
received from an upper entity. Specifically, the RLC<br>
transmitting side constructs a RLC PDU by segmenting and<br>
concatenating RLC SDUs received from an upper entity so as<br>
to match a MAC PDU size (i.e., a RLC PDU size) indicated by<br>
a lower entity. A header of a RLC PDU includes information<br>
associated with segmentation, concatenation or the like of<br>
RLC SDUs. Based on this information, the receiving side<br>
reconstructs RLC SDUs from received RLC PDUs.<br>
An overall data transmission procedure performed at<br>
L2 is as follows. First, externally created data (e.g., an<br>
IP packet) is transferred to a PDCP entity and is then<br>
converted into a PDCP SDU. The PDCP entity stores the PDCP<br>
SDU in its own buffer until transmission is completed. The<br>
PDCP entity processes the PDCP SDU to create PDCP PDUs and<br>
transfers the created PDCP PDUs to the RLC entity. A data<br>
block that the RLC entity receives from an upper entity is<br>
a RLC SDU, which is identical to a PDCP PDU. The RLC<br>
entity performs appropriate processing on the RLC SDU and<br>
constructs and transmits a RLC PDU.<br>
Example of General Operation of Frotocol Layer<br>
according to Embodiment of the Invention<br>
An embodiment of the present invention suggests a<br>
method for effectively managing data while satisfying<br>
Quality of Service (QoS) of an established (or configured)<br>
Radio Bearer (RB). To accomplish this, the embodiment of<br>
the present invention decides whether or not to discard<br>
data stored in a protocol layer entity of the transmitting<br>
side taking into consideration an allowed transfer time or<br>
a maximum allowed delay of data and a maximum buffer size<br>
that can be accommodated by the protocol layer entity of<br>
the transmitting side. Preferably, the protocol layer is a<br>
PDCP layer. An examplary general operation of the<br>
embodiment of the present invention is described in detail<br>
below focusing on the PDCP layer. Here, the term "discard"<br>
can be used interchangeably with similar terms such as<br>
"deletion", "delete", "abandon", "erase", "remove" and the<br>
like.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, the PDCP<br>
entity can decide whether or not to discard a PDCP SDU when<br>
transmission of the PDCP SDU has been delayed for a<br>
predetermined time in order to guarantee QoS of an<br>
established RB. The predetermined time can be set flexibly<br>
taking into consideration the type of data to be<br>
transmitted. The predetermined time can be set by the<br>
network. Preferably, the predetermined time can be set by<br>
a layer (e.g., RRC layer) above the PDCP layer. If needed,<br>
the PDCP SDU and/or PDC? PDU may not be discarded even when<br>
the predetermined time has elapsed.<br>
In an embodiment, the PDCP entity starts (in other<br>
terms, activates, runs or operates) a timer for a FDCP SDU<br>
when the PDCP SDU is received from an upper layer.<br>
Preferably, the upper layer is a Radio Resource Control<br>
(RRC) layer. The timer can run individually for each PDCP<br>
SDU. The timer can also run commonly for a specific number<br>
of PDCP SDUs or a specific group of PDCP SDUs. For example,<br>
when a specific number of related PDCP SDUs or a specific<br>
group of PDCP SDUs is present, the timer can run only for<br>
the first PDCP SDU.<br>
When the RLC entity has notified the PDCP entity that<br>
the RLC SDU (i.e., PDCP PDU) has been successfully<br>
transmitted while the timer is running, the PDCP entity can<br>
discard the PDCP PDU. In an implementation, the PDCP<br>
entity can discard a PDCP PDU when PDCP PDUs with serial<br>
numbers lower than that of the PDCP PDU have been<br>
successfully transmitted. The PDCP entity can also discard<br>
a PDCP PDU when PDCP SDUs previous to a PDCP SDU associated<br>
with the PDCP PDU have been successfully transmitted. When<br>
the PDCP PDU has been discarded, a timer of the PDCP SDU<br>
associated with the PDCP PDU is stopped. Preferably, the<br>
PDCP SDU whose timer has been stopped is discarded.<br>
When the timer expires while the PDCP entity has not<br>
received any notification of whether or not the PDCP PDU<br>
has been successfully transmitted from the RLC entity, the<br>
PDCP entity can decide to discard a PDCP SDU associated<br>
with the timer. The timer can be given a variety of names<br>
depending on its function. In an embodiment of the present<br>
invention, the timer can be referred to as a<br>
"discard_timer" since it is associated with discarding data<br>
of the PDCP layer.<br>
In an implementation, the value of the timer can be<br>
set by the network. Preferably, the value of the timer can<br>
be set by a layer (e.g., RRC layer) above the PDCP layer.<br>
The value of the timer is a setting associated with the<br>
timer. For example, the value of the timer may indicate a<br>
PDCP SDU or a PDCP PDU, based on which the timer will run.<br>
The value of the timer can also indicate an oneration<br>
performed at the PDCP layer, based on which the timer will<br>
run. The value of the timer may also include information<br>
associated with the time when the timer will expire after<br>
it is activated (i.e., information associated with the<br>
timer's expiration time). The timer's expiration time can<br>
be set taking into consideration all times associated with<br>
transmission of an IP packet (e.g., each duration the IP<br>
packet stays at the RLC entity and the PDCP entity, a<br>
transmission period, the maximum allowable delay of data,<br>
etc.).<br>
In addition, the timer expiration time can be set<br>
flexibly according to data type since not all IP packets or<br>
PDCP PDUs have the same importance. For example, a full-<br>
header packet is essential to form a context of header<br>
compression. Accordingly, a different timer value can be<br>
set according to the characteristics or attributes of<br>
packets. A timer may not be activated or the expiration<br>
time thereof may be set to infinity for a specified packet<br>
or PDCP PDU/SDU. Alternatively, the discard process may<br>
not be performed for the specified packet or PDCP PDU/SDU<br>
even when the timer has expired.<br>
When the PDCP entity has decided to discard a<br>
specific PDCP SDU and a PDCP PDU associated with the PDCP<br>
SDU has not been transferred to the RLC entity, the PDCP<br>
entity provides no notification to the RLC entity and<br>
discards the PDCP SDU. Preferably, the PDCP entity<br>
discards the PDCP PDU associated with the PDCP SDU together<br>
with the PDCP SDU.<br>
When the PDCP entity has decided to discard a<br>
specific PDCP SDU and a PDCP PDU associated with the PDCP<br>
SDU has already been transferred to the RLC entity, the<br>
PDCP entity provides information associated with discard of<br>
the PDCP SDU and/or PDCP PDU to the RLC entity and discards<br>
the PDCP SDU. Preferably, the information associated with<br>
the discard may be information indicating that a certain<br>
PDCP PDU (i.e., RLC SDU) or PDCP SDU has been discarded.<br>
The information associated with the discard may also be<br>
information requesting that the associated RLC SDU should<br>
be discarded or information used to request that the<br>
associated RLC SDU should be discarded.<br>
In the above procedure, when the PDCP SDU has been<br>
discarded, it is assumed that the associated PDCP PDU has<br>
been successfully transmitted and the successful<br>
transmission is reported to an upper layer.<br>
In the above procedure, when the RLC entity receives<br>
the information associated with the discard of a specific<br>
PDCP SDU and/or PDCP PDU (i.e., RLC SDU) from the PDCP<br>
entity, the RLC entity performs an operation for discarding<br>
an associated RLC SDU.<br>
The UM RLC entity discards the associated RLC SDU and<br>
no longer attempts to transmit a RLC PDU associated with<br>
the RLC SDU.<br>
The AM RLC entity performs an operation for<br>
discarding the associated RLC SDU. Preferably, the<br>
operation includes an operation of a RLC entity of a<br>
transmitting side to notify a RLC entity of a receiving<br>
side of a command indicating that the RLC SDU will no<br>
longer be transmitted. In this case, the AMD RLC entity of<br>
the transmitting side can also notify the AM RLC entity of<br>
the receiving side of a serial number cf a lower boundary<br>
of a reception RLC window or a transmission RLC window in<br>
association with the discarded RLC SDU. The AMD RLC entity<br>
of the transmitting side can notify the AM RLC entity of<br>
the receiving side of information associated with byte-<br>
offset together with the serial number.<br>
Preferably, the RLC entity may discard the RLC SDU<br>
when no part of the RLC SDU indicated by the PDCP layer has<br>
been transmitted. For example, in the case where the RLC<br>
SDU is segmented into at least one segment, the RLC SDU may<br>
be discarded if no segment of the RLC SDU has been<br>
transmitted. The transmitting side can determine whether<br>
or not any part of the RLC SDU has been transmitted based<br>
on whether or not the transmitting side has actually-<br>
transmitted any part of the RLC SDU. It does not matter<br>
whether cr not the receiving side has actually received<br>
data. That is, the transmitting side determines whether or<br>
not the data has been transmitted, only from the viewpoint<br>
of the transmitting side.<br>
Preferably, the transmitting side may determine<br>
whether or not any part of the RLC SDU has been transmitted<br>
based on whether or not any part of the RLC SDU has been<br>
mapped to a RLC PDU, preferably to a RLC data PDU. For<br>
example, when an upper layer has requested that a RLC SDU<br>
be discarded, the RLC SDU may be discarded only when no<br>
segment of the RLC SDU has been mapped to a RLC data PDU.<br>
In addition, when the RLC SDU, which has been<br>
requested to be discarded by the upper layer, is<br>
constructed into at least one RLC PDU, the RLC SDU can be<br>
discarded only when no related RLC PDU has been transmitted.<br>
Further, the RLC SDU may not be discarded when the RLC SDU<br>
is included in specific RLC PDUs and it has been attempted<br>
to transmit at least one of the specific RLC PDUs through a<br>
wireless interface. The RLC SDU may also be discarded only<br>
when the RLC SDU is not included in any RLC PDU or when it<br>
has not been attempted to transmit any one of the specific<br>
RLC PDUs through a wireless interface although the RLC SDU<br>
is included in the specific RLC PDUs. Whether or not it<br>
has been attempted to transmit the RLC PDU through a<br>
wireless interface can be determined based on whether or<br>
not any part of the RLC SDU has been mapped to a RLC PDU,<br>
preferably to a RLC data PDU.<br>
Although the above operations have been described<br>
mainly based on a PDCP SDU for ease of explanation, the<br>
operations may also be performed based on a PDCP PDU.<br>
Specifically, a timer may run in association with the PDCP<br>
PDU and associated operations may be performed accordingly.<br>
FIG. 7 illustrates examplary operations of a protocol<br>
layer performed at a UE or base station according to an<br>
embodiment of the present invention.<br>
As shown in FIG. 7, packets A and B are transferred<br>
from an upper layer to a PDCP layer (S710) . PDCP SDUs of<br>
the packets A and B are stored in a PDCP buffer and a<br>
discard_timer starts for each of the packets (S770). A MAC<br>
layer requests that a RLC layer transfer new MAC SDUs (RLC<br>
PDUs) (S720) . If the RLC layer has no new data to be<br>
transmitted, the RLC layer requests that a PDCP layer<br>
transfer new RLC SDUs (PDCP PDUs) (S730) . The PDCP layer<br>
performs header compression, ciphering and header addition<br>
on the PDCP SDUs of the packet A to create PDCP PDUs of the<br>
packet A (S740) . The PDCP layer transfers the PDCP PDUs of<br>
the packet A to the RLC layer (S750) . The RLC layer stores<br>
the PDCP PDUs (i.e., RLC SDUs) of the packet A in a RLC<br>
buffer. The RLC layer constructs a RLC PDD from the<br>
received RLC SDU of the packet A and transfers the RLC PDU<br>
to the MAC layer. The MAC/PHY layers perform transmission<br>
of the RLC PDU (S760).<br>
In FIG. 7, it is assumed that the PDCP layer has not<br>
received information, indicating that the receiving side<br>
has successfully received the PDCP PDU of the packet A,<br>
from the RLC layer until a discard_timer of the PDCP SDU<br>
for the packet A expires. It is also assumed that a<br>
discard_timer of the PDCP SDU for the packet B has expired<br>
almost at the same time.<br>
Since the discard_timers for the packets A and B have<br>
expired, the PDCP layer decides to discard the packets A<br>
and B from the buffer (S770) . Since the packet B has not<br>
yet been assigned a SN and has not been compressed or<br>
ciphered, the packet B is removed from the PDCP entity and<br>
the RLC entity is not notified that the packet B has been<br>
discarded.<br>
On the other hand, since the packet A has been<br>
assigned a SN and has already been compressed and<br>
transferred to the RLC entity, the PDCP layer requests that<br>
the RLC layer should discard a RLC SDU associated with the<br>
packet A (S780) . According to this notification, the RLC<br>
layer performs an operation for discarding the RLC SDU.<br>
The operation for discarding the RLC layer is described in<br>
more detail with reference to FIG. 8.<br>
FIG. 8 illustrates examplary operations of a protocol<br>
layer performed at a UE or base station according to<br>
another embodiment of the present invention.<br>
As shown in FIG. 8, a PDCP layer receives data blocks<br>
such as IP packets from an upper layer (811-813). The PDCP<br>
layer adds a SN to each of the received blocks and stores<br>
the blocks in a PDCP SDU buffer (821-823). At a request of<br>
a lower layer, the PDCP layer constructs PDCP SDUs into<br>
PDCP data PDUs and transfers the PDCP data PDUs to the RLC<br>
layer (831, 832 and 834). In this case, the PDCP layer can<br>
also generates a PDCP control PDU (833) including feedback<br>
information or the like associated with header compression<br>
into. The RLC layer stores the received RLC SDUs in a RLC<br>
SDU buffer (831-834) . At a request of a lower layer, the<br>
RLC layer may segment and concatenate the RLC SDUs to<br>
construct a plurality of RLC PDUs (841-844) .<br>
Although not illustrated in FIG. 8, when the PDCP<br>
layer receives a data block or stores data in the PDCP SDU<br>
buffer, a discard_timer is activated for each PDCP SDU, a<br>
specific number of PDCP SDUs or a specific group of PDCP<br>
SDUs. Alternatively, the discard_timer can run based on<br>
the PDCP PDU.<br>
The procedure in which the PDCP layer decides whether<br>
or not to discard the PDCP SDU is similar to that of FIG. 7.<br>
The following is a description of examplary operations of<br>
the PDCP layer in association with a PDCP control PDU<br>
according to another embodiment. Thereafter, the<br>
description will be given focusing on an operation of the<br>
RLC layer to discard a RLC SDU according to an instruction<br>
from the PDCP layer. The procedure of the RLC layer to<br>
discard the RLC SDU is applied to both the examples of FIGs.<br>
7 and 8.<br>
As shown in FIG. 3, PDCP data PDUs 831, 832, and 834<br>
and a PDCP control PDU 833 are created in association with<br>
a PDCP SDU. In the example of FIG. 8, the PDCP control PDU<br>
833 includes feedback information associated with header<br>
compression.<br>
When the fact that the PDCP control PDU can be<br>
created in association with a PDCP SDU is taken into<br>
consideration, a PDCP control PDU associated with a<br>
specific PDCP SDU can be discarded when the specific PDCP<br>
SDU is discarded. For example, a PDCP data PDU is created<br>
immediately after header compression is performed on the<br>
specific PDCP SDU. In this case, a PDCP control PDU can<br>
also be created. Here, the PDCP control PDU and the PDCP<br>
data PDU can be discarded together since they are<br>
associated with the PDCP SDU. Preferably, when a PDCP<br>
control PDU has been generated, the PDCP control PDU is<br>
discarded when a PDCP SDU generated simultaneously with the<br>
PDCP control PDU is discarded. Preferably, when a PDCP<br>
control PDU has been generated, the PDCP control PDU is<br>
discarded when a PDCP SDU generated immediately before the<br>
PDCP control PDU is discarded. Preferably, when a PDCP<br>
control PDU has been generated, the PDCP control PDU is<br>
discarded when a PDCP SDU generated next to the PDCP<br>
control PDU is discarded. Preferably, the PDCP control PDU<br>
includes a header compression packet.<br>
In addition, when the fact that not all PDCP control<br>
PDUs are associated with a PDCP SDU is taken into<br>
consideration, the PDCP control PDU may not be discarded<br>
even when the specific PDCP SDU has been discarded.<br>
Preferably, when a PDCP control PDU has been generated, the<br>
PDCP control PDU is not discarded even when a PDCP SDU<br>
generated simultaneously with the PDCP control PDU is<br>
discarded. Preferably, when a PDCP control PDU has been<br>
generated, the PDCP control PDU is not discarded even when<br>
a PDCP SDU generated immediately before the PDCP control<br>
PDU is discarded. Preferably, when a PDCP control PDU has<br>
been generated, the PDCP control PDU is not discarded even<br>
when a PDCP SDU generated next to the PDCP control PDU is<br>
discarded. Preferably, the PDCP control PDU is a PDCP<br>
status report.<br>
A separate timer can also run for a PDCP control PDU.<br>
Preferably, a separate timer starts for a PDCP control PDU<br>
when the PDCP control PDU is generated and the PDCP control<br>
PDU is discarded when the timer expires. Preferably, the<br>
same timer as that applied to a PDCP data PDU starts for a<br>
PDCP control PDU when the PDCP control PDU is generated and<br>
the PDCP control PDU is discarded when the timer expires.<br>
In this case, different timer values can be set for both<br>
the PDCP data PDU and the PDCP control PDU.<br>
In the above procedure, when a PDCP control PDU has<br>
been discarded, the PDC? entity notifies the RLC layer that<br>
the PDCP control PDU has been discarded. That is, the PDCP<br>
entity determines data to be discarded to guarantee QoS and<br>
instructs the RLC entity below the PDCP entity to discard a<br>
corresponding RLC SDU. The following is a description of<br>
an examplary procedure in which the RLC layer discards a<br>
specific RLC SDU when the PDCP layer has instructed the RLC<br>
layer to discard the RLC SDU.<br>
As shown in FIG. 8, one RLC SDU may be divided into a<br>
plurality of RLC PDUs to be transmitted or one RLC PDU may<br>
include a plurality of RLC SDUs.<br>
In the procedure for discarding specific RLC SDUs<br>
according to an instruction of the PDCP layer, removal of a<br>
RLC PDU including a plurality of RLC SDUs is wasteful if it<br>
is only necessary to discard some of the plurality of RLC<br>
SDUs included in the RLC PDU. In this case, the<br>
transmitting side of the AM RLC entity should not attempt<br>
to transmit RLC SDUs that were discarded according to the<br>
instruction of the PDCP layer and should attempt to<br>
retransmit other RLC SDUs until the RLC entity of the<br>
receiving side notifies the transmitting side of successful<br>
reception. To accomplish this, the transmitting side of<br>
the RLC entity may divide the RLC PDU (particularly, the AM<br>
RLC data PDU) to construct AM RLC data PDU segments that do<br>
not include the discarded RLC SDUs and then transmit the AM<br>
RLC data PDU segments to the receiving side. That is, when<br>
a RLC SDU has been discarded, the AM RLC data PDU segments<br>
including the discarded RLC SDU are no longer transmitted.<br>
In the procedure for discarding specific RLC SDUs<br>
according to an instruction of the PDCP layer, the UM RLC<br>
entity discards all RLC PDUs including the RLC SDU and no<br>
longer transmits the discarded RLC PDUs. The UM RLC entity<br>
also discards the RLC SDU and no longer transmits<br>
associated RLC PDUs.<br>
Preferably, even when the PDCP layer has instructed<br>
to discard a specific RLC SDU, the RLC SDU may be removed<br>
from the RLC buffer only when no part of the RLC SDU has<br>
been attempted to be transmitted or has been transmitted.<br>
That is, in the case where the RLC SDU has been divided<br>
into a plurality of segments, the RLC SDU can be removed<br>
from the RLC buffer only when no segment of the RLC SDU has<br>
been attempted to be transmitted or has been transmitted.<br>
For example, the RLC SDU may be removed from the RLC buffer<br>
only when no segment of the RLC SDU has been mapped to a<br>
RLC data PDU.<br>
According to the embodiments of the present invention,<br>
it is possible to satisfy QoS of an established radio<br>
bearer and to effectively manage data in multiple protocol<br>
layers.<br>
The above embodiments are provided by combining<br>
components and features of the present invention in<br>
specific forms. The components or features of the present<br>
invention should be considered optional if not explicitly<br>
stated otherwise. The components or features may be<br>

<br>
the embodiments of the present invention may be changed.<br>
Some components or features of one embodiment may be<br>

It will be apparent that claims which are not explicitly<br>
dependent on each other can be combined to provide an<br>
embodiment or new claims can be added through amendment<br>
after this application is filed.<br>
The above embodiments of the present invention have<br>
been described focusing mainly on the data communication<br>
relationship between a UE (or terminal) and a Base Station<br>
(BS) . Specific operations which have been described as<br>
being performed by the BS may also be performed by upper<br>
nodes as needed. That is, it will be apparent to those<br>
skilled in the art that the BS or any other network node<br>
may perform various operations for communication with<br>
terminals in a network including a number of network nodes<br>
including BSs. The term "base station (BS)" may be<br>
replaced with another term such as "fixed station", "Node<br>
B", "eNode B (eNB)", or "access point". The term<br>
"terminal" may also be replaced with another term such as<br>
"user equipment (UE)", "mobile station (MS)", "mobile<br>
station (MS)", or "mobile subscriber station (MSS)".<br>
The embodiments of the present invention can be<br>

WHAT IS CLAIMED IS:<br>
1. A method of processing data by a user equipment<br>
in a wireless mobile communication system, the method<br>
comprising the steps of:<br>
receiving a first data block from an upper layer;<br>
transferring a second data block including the first<br>
data block to a lower layer at a particular protocol layer;<br>
discarding the first and second data blocks present<br>
in the particular protocol layer if a certain period of<br>
time has passed; and<br>
transferring an information associated with the<br>
discard of the second data block to the lower layer.<br>
2. A method of processing data by a user equipment<br>
in a wireless mobile communication system, the method<br>
comprising the steps of:<br>
operating a timer for a first data block at a<br>
particular protocol layer when receiving the first data<br>
block from an upper layer;<br>
transferring a second data block including the first<br>
data block to a lower layer at a particular protocol layer;<br>
discarding the first and second data blocks present<br>
in the particular protocol layer if the timer expires; and<br>
transferring an information associated with the<br>
discard of the second data block to the lower layer.<br>
3. The method of claim 1 or 2, wherein the<br>
information associated with the discard serves to indicate<br>
the discard of the second data block or to instruct the<br>
lower layer to discard the second data block.<br>
4. The method of claim 1 or 2, further comprising<br>
the step of discarding the second data block by the lower<br>
layer if no part of the second data block has been<br>
transmitted.<br>
5. The method of claim 1 or 2, wherein the<br>
particular protocol layer is a Packet Data Convergence<br>
Protocol (PDCP) layer.<br>
6. The method of claim 5, wherein the first data<br>
block is a PDCP Service Data Unit (PDCP SDU).<br>
7. The method of claim 5, wherein the second data<br>
block is a PDCP Protocol Data Unit (PDCP PDU).<br>
8. The method of claim 5, wherein the upper layer<br>
is a Radio Resource Control (RRC) layer.<br>
9. The method of claim 5, wherein the lower layer<br>
is a Radio Link Control (RLC) layer.<br>
10. The method of claim 3, wherein the RLC layer<br>
operates in an Acknowledged Mode (AM) or an Unacknowledged<br>
Mode (UM).<br>
11. The method of claim 1, wherein the certain<br>
period of time is indicated by a network.<br>
12. The method of claim 1, wherein the certain<br>
period of time is indicated by an upper layer above the<br>
particular protocol layer.<br>
13. The method of claim 2, wherein a value of the<br>
timer is indicated by a network.<br>
14. The method of claim 2, wherein a value of the<br>
timer is indicated by an upper layer above the particular<br>
protocol layer.<br>
15. A method of processing data by a user equipment<br>
in a wireless mobile communication system, the method<br>
comprising the steps of:<br>
receiving a data block from an upper layer;<br>
receiving information associated with discard of the<br>
data block from the upper layer; and<br>
discarding the data block at a particular protocol<br>
layer if no part of the data block has been transmitted.<br>
16. The method of claim 15, wherein the information<br>
associated with the discard serves to indicate the discard<br>
of the data block or to instruct discard of the data block.<br>
17. The method of claim 15, wherein the upper layer<br>
is a PDCP layer.<br>
18. The method of claim 17, wherein the data block<br>
is a RLC SDU.<br>
19. The method of claim 17, wherein the particular<br>
protocol layer is a RLC layer.<br>
20. The method of claim 19, wherein the RLC layer<br>
operates in an Acknowledged Mode (AM) or an Unacknowledged<br>
Mode (UM).<br>
21. The method of claim 15, wherein, when the data<br>
block is segmented into at least one segment, the data<br>
block is discarded if no segment of the data block has been<br>
transmitted.<br>
22. The method of claim 15, wherein whether or not<br>
any part of the data block has been transmitted is<br>
determined based on whether or not any part of the data<br>
block has been mapped to a data PDU of the particular<br>
protocol layer.<br>
<br>
<br>
A method in which a user equipment processes data in a wireless mobile communication system is provided. The<br>
method includes the steps of receiving a first data block from an upper layer, transferring a second data block including the first data<br>
block to a lower layer at a particular protocol layer, discarding the first and second data blocks present in the particular protocol layer<br>
if a certain period of time has passed, and transferring information associated with the discard of the second data block to the lower<br>
layer.</td>
