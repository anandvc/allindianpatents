THE PATENTS ACT, 1970 (39 of 1970)<br>
COMPLETE SPECIFICATION (See Section 10, rule 13)<br>
THREAD SPLICING/SPLITING EQUIPMENT<br>
SAURER GmbH &amp; CO., KG. Of LANDGRAFENSTRASSE 45, D-41069, MONCHENGLADBACH, GERMANY, GERMAN Company<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed : -<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
22 JUL 2004<br><br><br><br><br><br>
The invention relates to a thread splicing device in accordance with the preamble to Claim 1.<br>
Thread splicing devices in connection with automatic cheese or cone winders have long been known, and are described in detail in numerous protective rights applications.<br>
DE 39 35 536 C2, for example, describes a thread splicing device with a splicing head capable of being subjected to pneumatic pressure, which in cross-section exhibits an almost circular splicing channel. Tangentially-arranged blown-in apertures for compressed air open into the splicing channel, which is provided on its upper side with a continuous slot for inserting the thread ends which are to be spliced.<br>
The thread insertion slot, and therefore the splicing channel, can be closed during the splicing process by means of a cover element mounted on bearings such as to be capable of pivoting.<br>
Such or similar thread splicing devices are used in large numbers in the textile industry and have proved their worth in outstanding fashion in practice, in particular in connection with cotton yarns and mixtures thereof.<br>
With some difficult yarns, for example with flax or linen yarns, it has transpired in this situation to be of advantage if a certain amount of liquid is added to the splicing air.<br>
Due to the liquid in the splicing air the fibres become somewhat more supple, and their jointed strength after splicing is also improved.<br><br>
In addition to this, as a result of the water particles contained in the splicing air, the kinetic energy of the splicing air is increased, which is often of advantage when splicing*more difficult yarns.<br>
Such thread splicing devices, also known as Aqua-Splicers, do however exhibit the disadvantage that they are heavily inclined to dirt contamination. That is to say, due to the excess liquid emerging from the Aqua Splicers the contaminants present in the ambient air are bonded and deposited as a dirt film.<br>
Because such thread splicing devices are used as a rule in textile plants in which the air is often heavily burdened with dust and/or fibre fly and lint, substantial deposits of dirt build up relatively quickly, which make regular cleaning of these parts and their surrounding areas, often by hand, absolutely essential.<br>
In order to avoid time-consuming and tedious cleaning, it has already been proposed that the fibre splicing device should be arranged protected in a trough which can be hermetically sealed during the splicing process.<br>
Such fibre splicing devices, known for example from DE 101 05 296 Al, exhibit a trough which can be closed off by a splicer cover, into which two water drain gullies open. The water drain gullies are in this situation connected to an underpressure source.<br>
Although such an arrangement is capable of reducing the degree of dirt contamination in the area of the thread splicing devices, such devices have the disadvantage that they require a relatively large amount of space.<br>
That is to say that such devices can only be installed with difficulty in the area of the winding heads of an automatic<br><br><br>
cheese or cone winder, in particular as a subsequent installation.<br>
Taking the foregoing prior art as a starting point, the invention is based on the problem of providing,a compact thread splicing device which allows for even problematic yarns, flax and linen yarns in particular, to be reliably connected without excessive dirt contamination in the area of the thread splicing device.<br>
This problem is resolved according to the invention by a thread splicing device such as is described in Claim 1.<br>
Advantageous embodiments"of the invention are the object of the sub-claims.<br>
Although with Aqua-Splicers the occurrence of excess liquid<br>
cannot be entirely avoided, despite careful metering during<br>
the enrichment of the splicing air, it is ensured by the<br>
arrangement according to the Invention of the thread<br>
splicing device that no further splicing air enriched with<br>
liquid can emerge from the splicing head. That is to say<br>
that, due to the embodiment of the thread splicing device<br>
according to the invention, the degree of dirt contamination<br>
of such thread splicing devices is perceptible reduced.<br>
The consequence of this is that the intervals of time between the individual cleaning episodes can be substantially extended.<br>
Thanks to the integration of at least one suction aperture directly in the splicing head and in the cover element of the thread splicing device respectively, the thread splicing device can also be designed to be very compact, which, because of the known limited spatial circumstances at the winding heads of an automatic cheese or cone winder, is extremely advantageous, and, for example, also makes<br><br><br>
possible the subsequent installation of the thread splicing device according to the invention in textile machines which are already in operation.<br>
As described in Claim 2, provision is made in an advantageous embodiment for the suction aperture to open into the splicing channel in the area of the channel bed. Such an arrangement allows in a simple manner for an immediate and effective removal by suction of excess liquid.<br>
For preference, several of these suction apertures capable of being subjected to underpressure are arranged in the area of the bed of the splicing channel (Claim 3).<br>
Thanks to the arrangement of a large number of such suction apertures in the bed of the splicing channel, it can be ensured that the superfluous liquid can be sucked up immediately and completely, and cannot escape from the splicing channel.<br>
As described in Claim 4, the suction apertures are for preference connected via a common pneumatic line to an underpressure source, which in turn is connected via an outflow line to a catchment tank, which accommodates the superfluous liquid from the splicing air.<br>
Such an arrangement provides for a structurally simple and therefore advantageous disposal of the superfluous splicing air liquid.<br>
Instead of the outflow line described heretofore, a ring line can be provided in an alternative embodiment (Claim 5) .<br>
By means of such a ring line, the superfluous liquid, for preference after flowing through a filter element, is conducted directly back into a storage container, which<br><br><br>
holds the liquid ready for the enrichment of the splicing air.<br>
This means that the superfluous liquid is again available for the enrichment of the splicing air.<br>
As represented in Claim 6, provision is made in a further alternative embodiment for the suction apertures to be integrated into the cover element of the thread splicing device.<br>
In this case, the suction apertures are positioned along the length of the splicing channel with the cover element closed, which allows for the thorough suction removal of superfluous liquid.<br>
The suction apertures are in this case connected inside<br>
the cover element for preference by means of a branch channel<br>
(Claim 7) , which in turn is connected by means of a flexible<br>
underpressure  line  to  a  corresponding  appropriate<br>
underpressure source.<br>
In order to enrich the splicing air with liquid, a special metering device is also provided. This means that a metering valve is introduced into a suction and injection line which extends between a liquid container and the compressed-air blow-in aperture of the thread splicing device, said valve being connected by a control line to the winding head computer.<br>
The metering valve can be opened in a manner defined by the winding head computer, and the splicing air enrichment can therefore be controlled.<br>
The invention is explained hereinafter in greater detail on the basis of an embodiment represented in the drawings.<br><br><br>
These show:<br>
Fig. 1 side view of a workplace of an automatic cheese or core winder, with a thread splicing device according to the invention,<br>
Fig. 2 first embodiment of the thread splicing device according to the invention,<br>
Fig. 3 further embodiment of the thread splicing device according to the invention.<br>
Figure 1 shows a frontal view in diagrammatic form of a textile machine for the manufacture of cross-wound bobbins, in the embodiment an automatic cheese or cone winder,<br>
characterised overall by the reference number 1.<br><br>
Such automatic cheese or cone winders usually exhibit a large number of work stations between their end frames (not shown), in the present case winding heads 2.<br>
On these winding heads 2, in a known manner and therefore not explained in any greater detail, spinning cops 9 are wound, produced, for example, on a ring spinning machine, to form large-volume cross-wound bobbins 15.<br>
After production these cross-wound bobbins 15 are transferred by means of an automatic service device onto a cross-wound bobbin transport device 21 extending the length of the machine, and are then conveyed to a bobbin loading station or the like arranged at the machine end side.<br>
Usually, such automatic cheese or cone, winders 1 also exhibit a logistics device in the form of a bobbin and empty bobbin holder conveying system 3, in which spinning cops or bobbins 9 or empty bobbin holders respectively circulate<br><br><br>
on conveyor plates 8 in the vertical direction.<br>
Of this bobbin and empty bobbin case conveyor system 3, Figure 1 shows only the head feed line 4, the reversible driven storage line 5, one of the transverse conveying stretches 6 leading to the winding station 2, and the empty bobbin return line 7.<br>
In addition to this, automatic cheese or cone winders 1 are provided as a rule with a central control unit (not shown), which is connected via a machine bus both to the separate workplace computers 29 of the individual winding heads, 2 as well as to a control device of the service equipment.<br>
  The spinning cops 9 are rewound in the unwinding positions AS, which in each case are located in the area of the transverse conveying stretches 6 at the winding heads 2, to form large-volume cross-wound bobbins 15.<br>
For this purpose the individual winding heads are provided, in a known manner and therefore only indicated in principle, with various different devices which will guarantee the operation of these workplaces in the proper manner.<br>
These devices are, for example, a suction nozzle 12, a gripper tube 25, and a thread connection device 10. As indicated in Figure 1, the pneumatic thread splicing device 10, which in the present example is designed as what is referred to as an Aqua. Splicer, is somewhat set back with regard to the regular run of the thread. Further devices of such winding heads, not shown, are thread tensioners, thread cleaners, paraffining devices, thread cutting devices, thread tension force sensors, and underthread  sensors.<br>
The winding of the cross-wound bobbins or cheeses 15 takes<br><br><br>
place on what are referred to as winding devices 24. Such a winding device 24 is provided, among other elements, with a winding frame 28, which is mounted on bearings such as to move about a pivot axis 13, and also exhibits a device for the rotatable mounting of an empty bobbin for a cross-wound bobbin or cheese. During the winding process the cross-wound bobbin 15, mounted so as to be freely rotatable in the winding frame 28, is located with its surface on a grooved drum or cam cylinder 14, and is moved in sympathy with this by friction.<br>
As already indicated heretofore, each winding head 2 is provided with a suction nozzle 12 and a gripper tube 25. The suction nozzle 12 in this situation is mounted about a pivot axis 16, and the gripper tube 25 about a pivot axis 2.6, with limited rotatability.<br>
Figure 2 shows a first embodiment of a thread connecting device 10 according to the invention, designed as an Aqua Splicer.<br>
As can be seen, a compressed-air blow-in aperture	34,<br>
arranged centrally for preference, and at least	one<br>
additional suction extraction aperture 33 open into	the<br>
splicing channel 20 of the splicing head 19.<br>
The compressed-air blow-in aperture 34 in this situation is connected to a compressed-air source 36 via a pneumatic line 35, into which a directional valve 37 is installed. In addition to this, a suction and injection line 43, connected to a liquid container 18, also opens into the pneumatic line 35.<br>
As indicated, a metering valve 27 is installed in this suction and injection line 43, said valve being connected via a control line 42 to the winding head computer 29. This means that, during the spinning process, the splicing<br><br><br>
air introduced via the compressed-air blow-in aperture 34 can be enriched with liquid in a defined manner, which is extremely advantageouo with certain specific materials ouch as flax and/or linen.<br>
The suction extraction apertures 33 are connected to an underpressure source 41 via a line 39, which likewise exhibits a directional valve 40, whereby the underpressure source 41 is in turn connected to an outflow line 11 with a catchment container 13 for superfluous liquid.<br>
The superfluous liquid which originally enters the splicing channel with the splicing air can be reliably removed via this outflow line 11.<br>
Instead of an outflow line 11, which is connected to a catchment container 13, a ring line 17 can also be provided for.<br>
The ring line 17, represented in Fig. 2 by a broken line, then connects the underpressure source 41 directly to a liquid container 18, from which the metering device for the splicing air is supplied with liquid via the suction and injection line 43.<br>
Like the metering valve 27, the directional valve 37 and the directional valve 40 are connected to the winding head computer 29 and can be controlled via a control line 38.<br>
The splicing head 19, which is secured to a basic body element 22 of the thread splicing device 10 by means of, for example, a screw connection (not shown), is provided with a splicing channel 20, open to the front in the installed state. The splicing channel 20, which can be closed during the splicing process by means of a cover element 23 mounted on bearings so as to be rotatable, exhibits a channel bed 30, with a U-shaped cross-section<br><br><br>
in the embodiment shown.<br>
As already indicated heretofore, at least one compressed-air blow-in aperture 34 and at least one further suction extraction aperture 33 open into this channel bed 30. As indicated in the embodiment according to Fig. 2, there are for preference several suction apertures 33 provided, which are arranged, for example, symmetrically in relation to the compressed-air blow-in aperture 34, and, as already indicated heretofore, are connected via an underpressure line 39 to an underpressure source 41.<br>
Fig. 3 shows an alternative embodiment of a thread splicing device 10 according to the invention. In a similar manner to the embodiment according to Fig. 2, a compressed-air .blow-in aperture 34 and suction apertures 33, which can be subjected to underpressure, open into the splicing channel 20 of the thread splicing device 10.<br>
In this situation, as known from Fig. 2, a liquid metering device is connected to the compressed-air blow-in aperture 34, which is connected to a compressed-air source 3 6 via a pneumatic line 35, in which a directional valve 37 is installed.<br>
The liquid metering device consists essentially of a metering valve 27, which can be controlled in a defined manner, which is connected via a suction and injection line 43, to a liquid container 18.<br>
The suction apertures 33, as is likewise known from Fig. 2, are connected via a line 3 9 to an underpressure source 41. A directional valve 40, which can be controlled by the winding head computer, is also installed in the line 39.<br>
The device for the extraction suction of superfluous liquid<br><br><br>
is in this embodiment integrated into the cover element 23. This means that the cover element 23 exhibits a stitch channel 47 arranged parallel to the splicing channel 20, said stitch channel being connected to an underpressure source 44 via a flexible suction extraction line 48.<br>
As indicated in Fig. 3, also installed in the suction extraction line 48 is a valve 45, which can be controlled in a defined manner by the winding head computer 29. The underpressure source 44 is connected either via an outflow line 51 to a catchment container 53 or via a ring line 57, indicated by a broken line, to a liquid container 18.<br>
Function of the device:<br>
When an interruption occurs in winding at one of the winding heads 2 of the automatic cheese or cone winder 1, due for example to a regular cleaner cut or a thread break, the suction nozzle 12 takes up the upper thread 31 which has run onto the cross-wound bobbin or cheese 15 and brings it to the thread splicing device 10. That is to say that the upper thread 31 is taken up by the suction nozzle 12 and threaded into the splicing channel 20 of the splicing head 19 of the thread splicing device 10 and the thread cutting and clamping device pertaining to it (not shown).<br>
At the same time or immediately thereafter, the underthread 32, held in the thread tensioner, is taken up by the gripper tube 25. For this purpose the gripper tube 25 pivots into the area of the thread tensioner and there sucks up the underthread 32, which is simultaneously released by the thread tensioner. The gripper tube 25 pivots into its upper working position and in this situation likewise lays the underthread 32 into the splicing channel 20 of the splicing head 19 . The underthread 32 in this situation is also laid into the thread cutting and clamping device.<br><br><br>
After the splicing head 19 has been closed off by the cover element 23, the threads 31, 32 fixed in the thread cutting and clamping devices are cut, whereby the cut thread end of the underthread 32 is disposed of by the gripper tube 25, and the cut thread end of the upper thread 31 is disposed of by the suction nozzle 12.<br>
As is known, the thread ends of the upper thread 31 and lower thread 32 projecting from the splicing channel 20 are then sucked into one of the thread end preparation tubes (not shown), subjected to underpressure, and are there at least partially freed from their thread rotation, for preference by pneumatic means.<br>
The thread ends of the upper thread and underthread, 31   and 32 respectively, prepared in this manner, are drawn by what is referred to as a loop drawer or the like (not shown) into the splicing channel 20, which, for example, exhibits a channel bed 30 which is U-shaped or V-shaped in cross-section.  That is to say that the thread ends of the upper thread and underthread 31, 32, slide into the channel bed 30 of the splicing channel 20, where, after the directional valve 40 is opened, they are pneumatically fixed in position by means of the suction apertures 33 subjected to underpressure. The individual fibres of the thread ends of the underthread 31 and upper thread 32, initially arranged almost parallel in the channel bed 30 of the splicing channel 20, are then Swirled together by a jet of splicing air.<br>
The splicing air, which is blown into the splicing channel 20 via the compressed-air blow-in apertures 34 after the opening of the directional valve 37, has been previously enriched with liquid by the corresponding actuation of the metering valve 27. That is to say that the splicing air, by means of which the two thread ends of the underthread 32 and upper thread 31 are pneumatically spliced, exhibits<br><br><br><br>
a relatively high moisture content. In order to prevent any superfluous liquid which has passed with the splicing air jet into the splicing channel 20 from emerging from the splicing channel 20, this liquid is immediately sucked up and disposed of via the suction removal  apertures 33.<br>
The superfluous liquid sucked away in the splicing channel 20 passes back either via the outflow line 11 into the catchment container 13 or via the ring line 17 into the liquid container 18.<br>
In all situations, it is ensured that no more superfluous liquid can emerge from the splicing head 19 of the thread splicing device 10, and cannot cause dirt contamination to the thread splicing device 10 and adjacent parts and ■, components.<br><br><br>
