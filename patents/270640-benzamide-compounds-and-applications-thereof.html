Certain concentrations of test comopounds were sprayed on both sides of the discs at the spray volume of 0.5 mL by Airbrush spraying treatment. Ten test insects (2 years) were introduced on each treatment after drying. Each treatment repeated 3 times. The treated discs were placed in a chamber of 24?, 60%-70% relative humidity, no light. After 96 h, the number of surviving insects was investigated and the mortality rates were calculated.<br>
In this test, the following compounds exhibite mortality 90% or more against diamondback moth at 150 ppm: 1.1?1.2?1.14a?1.14?1.25a?1.26.<br>
The following compounds exhibite mortality 90% or more against diamondback moth at 40 ppm: 1.1?1.2?1.14a?1.26.<br>
The following compounds exhibite mortality 90% or more against diamondback moth at 10 ppm: 1.1,1.14,1.16.<br>
Exp. 6.2 Test against Beet armyworm (Laphygma exigua Hubner)<br>
The cabbage leaves were perforated to get 1 cm diameter leaf discs by the hole puncher. Certain concentrations of test comopounds were sprayed on both sides of the discs at the spray volume of 0.5 ml by Airbrush. Ten test insects (3 years) were introduced on each treatment after drying. Each treatment repeated 3 times. The treated discs were placed in a chamber of 24?, 60%-70% relative humidity, no light. After 96 h, the number of surviving insects was investigated and the mortality rates were calculated.<br>
In this test, the following compounds exhibite mortality 100% against Beet armyworm at 20 ppm: 1.23.<br>
The following compounds exhibite mortality 90% or more against Beet armyworm at 1 ppm: 1.1?1.2?1.3?1.4?1.5?1.6?1.7?1.8?1.9?1.10?1.11? 1.14?1.15?1.16?1.17?1.18?1.19?1.20?1.21?1.24?1.27.<br>
The following compounds exhibite mortality 90% or more against Beet armyworm at 0.2 ppm: 1.1?1.4?1.14?1.15?1.18?1.19?1.21?1.24.<br>
According to above method, compound 1.14 and KC (compound D477 in the patent WO03/015518A1) were choosed to parallel test the activity against Beet armyworm. The result was listed in table 3.<br>

Exp. 7 Fungicidal activity tests<br>
According to the solubility of test compounds, the original pesticides are dissolved in acetone or dimethyl sulfoxide, and then diluted with 1 ‰ solution of Tween 80 to the test liquid 50 ml, the content of acetone or dimethyl sulfoxide in the total solution is not more than 10%.<br>
Exp. 7.1 In vitro fungicidal activity test against rice blast ( Pyricularia grisea). <br>
The melt AEA culture medium was cooled to 60-70?, and calculated amount of the test compounds were added according to the designed concentration to prapare compound-containing culture medium, the final content of test compound was 25ppm, After the medium cooling down sufficiently, rice blast pathogen of 0.5 cm diameter was inoculated and placed into the growth oven. The evaluation was performed after 10 days of inoculation. The measurement of the diameter of each colony was carried out and the rate of fungi inhibition was calculated. <br>
The control efficacies of compound 1.17 against rice blast is over 90%. <br><br>
Exp. 7.2 In vivo fungicidal activity test against cucumber downy mildew: <br>
Select a consistent growth of potted cucumber seedlings, neatly cut growing point and two mail leaves reserved. The testing compound solutions were sprayed at 400 ppm.  Cucumber downy mildew spore suspension was inoculated at the second day after the treatment of the test materials, then placed in the artificial climate chamber (temperature: day 25 ?, the night 20 ?, relative humidity: 95 ~ 100%) to cultivate, investigating the prevention and control effect after 6 days of moisturizing cultivation, recorded the onset of disease in 6 levels, calculated prevention control effect according to disease index.<br>
The protective controlling effect of compound 1.14 against cucumber downy mildew is more than 90%.<br><br>
