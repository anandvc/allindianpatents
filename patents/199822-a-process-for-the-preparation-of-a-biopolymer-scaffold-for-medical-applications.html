				<td>The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of a biopolymer scaffold for medical applications. More particularly, the present invention relates to a process for the preparation of biopolymeric scaffold, which is three dimensional in nature. The scaffold is envisaged to have enormous medical applications in respect of drug delivery, wound dressing and tissue-regenerating purpose. It also finds application as a container for delivery of bioactive molecules like growth factors and osteotropic factors. The structure of the scaffold is of paramount importance because of the fact that when implanted in the body as temporary structures, it provides a template that allows the body's own cells to grow and form new tissues while the scaffold is gradually absorbed.<br>
Scaffolds are polymeric hollow fiber membranes, conventionally used for favouring tissue growth while treating bone defects. While naturally derived or synthetic materials may be fashioned into scaffolds, biocompatibility of the product poses a challenge for the medical application. Successful regeneration of cells can be achieved only with tissue-engineered cartilage implant if the seeded cells reveal an appropriate proliferation rate in the biodegradable scaffold together with the production of a new cartilage-specific extracellular matrix. Continuous efforts are therefore being made by the researchers to provide appropriate scaffolds exhibiting excellent biocompatibility.<br>
Temenoff and Mikos (Biomaterials, 21,431-40,2000) and Lawrence and Vacanti (Journal of cellular Biochemistry Supplements, 30, 297-303,1998) have reported that the emerging field of tissue engineering may help to resolve many of the problems with regard to lack of donor organs or efficient organ substitutes. Tissue engineering involves the use of cells to regenerate the damaged tissue,<br>
leaving only natural substances to restore organ function. It has been found that in order for the cells to maintain their tissue-specific functions once implanted, a substrate material must be inserted to aid in organization of the cells in three dimensions. In considering substrate materials, it is imperative to choose one that exhibits good biocompatibility. This means that the material must not elicit an unresolved inflammatory response nor demonstrate extreme immunogenicity or cytotoxicity. In addition, the mechanical properties of the scaffold must be sufficient so that it does not collapse during the patient's normal activities. As with all materials in contact with the human body, these scaffolds must be easily sterilizable to prevent infection.<br>
According to Hutmacher (Biomaterials, 21, 2529-43, 2000), a scaffold should have the following characteristics: (i) three-dimensional and highly porous with an interconnected pore network for cell growth and flow transport of nutrients and metabolic waste; (ii) biocompatible and bio resorbable with a controllable degradation and resorption rate to match cell/tissue growth in vitro and/or in vivo; (iii) suitable surface chemistry for cell attachment, proliferation, and differentiation and (iv) mechanical properties to match those of the tissues at the site of implantation<br>
Synthetic polymeric materials have been explored for use as tissue engineering scaffolds and drug delivery devices. Many investigators have concentrated on synthetic biodegradable polymers that are already approved by the Food and Drug Administration, USA, as reported by Yoon et al, (Biomaterials, 24, 2323-29, 2003), Hou et al, (Biomaterials, 24, 1937-47, 2003) and Jang et al (Journal of controlled release, 86, 156-68,2003). These are the poly (hydroxy esters) that are degraded by hydrolysis to products which can be metabolized and excreted.<br>
Temenoff and Mikos (Biomaterials, 21, 431-40, 2000) and Schnabelrauch et al (Biomol Eng, 19, 295-8, 2002), have reported the synthesis, sterilization, toxicity, biocompatibility and clinical applications of scaffolds prepared with polylactic acid (PLLA) / polyglycolic acid (PGA) copolymers. These polymers offer distinct advantages in that their sterilizability and relative biocompatibility have been well documented. In addition, their degradation rates can be tailored to match that of new tissue formation. PLLA is more hydrophobic and less crystalline than PGA and degrades at a slower rate.<br>
Mikos and Temenoff (Electronic Journal of Biotechnology, 3,114-19, 2000) have reported that in addition to degradation rate, certain physical characteristics of the scaffolds must be considered when designing a substrate to be used in tissue engineering. In order to promote tissue growth, the scaffold must have a large surface area to allow cell attachment. This is usually prepared by creating highly porous polymer foam. In these foams, the pore size should be large enough so that cells penetrate the pores, and the pores must be interconnected to facilitate nutrient and waste exchange by cells deep within the construct. These characteristics (porosity and pore size) are often dependent on the method of scaffold fabrication.<br>
According to Angela et al (Biomaterials, 24, 481-89, 2003) the biodegradable porous polymer scaffolds are widely used in tissue engineering to provide a structural template for cell seeding and extracellular matrix formation. Scaffolds must often possess sufficient structural integrity to temporarily withstand functional loading in vivo or cell traction forces in vitro. Poly (lactic acid) (PLA) and poly (L-lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA), poly (Llactide-co-DL-lactide (PLDL) have been widely used as three-dimensional (3D) polymer scaffolds for cell transplantation and drug delivery applications, since they are biodegradable and biocompatible. It is important that the<br>
scaffolds are highly porous enough to allow a high density of cells to be seeded, and when the cell-device construct is implanted in the body, they should permit the facile invasion of blood vessels for the supply of nutrients to the transplanted cells. To fulfill these requirements, the polymer scaffolds should have several physical characteristics such as high porosity, a large surface area, a large pore size, and a uniformly distributed and highly interconnected pore structure throughout the matrix.<br>
Leong et al. (U.S. Pat. No. 5,686,091) disclosed a method in which biodegradable porous polymer scaffolds are prepared by molding a solvent solution of the polymer under conditions permitting spinodal decomposition, followed by quenching of the polymer solution in the mold and sublimation of the solvent from the solution. A uniform pore distribution is disclosed. A biomodal pore distribution would increase the degree of pore interconnectivity by creating additional channels between the pores, thereby increasing total porosity and surface area<br>
Healy et al. (U.S. Pat. No. 5,723,508) have disclosed a method in which biodegradable porous polymer scaffolds are prepared by forming an emulsion of the polymer, a first solvent in which the polymer is soluble, and a second polymer that is immiscible with the first solvent, and then freeze-drying the emulsion under conditions that do not break the emulsion or throw the polymer out of solution. This process, however, also produces a more uniform pore size distribution, with the majority of the pores ranging from 9 to 35 microns in diameter.<br>
However, these synthetic polymers possess a surface chemistry that does not promote cell adhesion. In addition, they produce a high local concentration of acidic by-products during degradation that can induce an adverse inflammatory response or create a local environment in the scaffold that may not favor the biological activity of cells being cultured for tissue engineering purposes. Furthermore, these processing<br>
techniques (excluding fibre meshes) are dependent on a randomly distributed pore generator to form the pores within the scaffold. Consequently, these processing techniques are unable to precisely control pore size, ensure reliable interconnection and control the distribution of pores within the scaffold. In addition, these processing techniques cannot produce a controlled internal architecture, which would favor the growth of blood vessels.<br>
The limitations associated with the synthetic polymers have prompted the researchers to explore possibilities of using biopolymers. A biopolymer is a naturally occurring polymeric substance formed from individual molecules in a biological system or organism. Biopolymers can also be man-made by manipulation of the individual molecules once obtained outside the biological system or organism. The biopolymer is suitable for introduction into a living organism, e.g., a mammal, e.g., a human. The biopolymer is non-toxic and bio absorbable when introduced into a living organism and any degradation products of the biopolymer should also be non-toxic to the organism. The biopolymers of the invention can be formed into biocompatible forms, e.g., biocompatible scaffolds, biocompatible foams, biocompatible gels, biocompatible constructs which include biocompatible fibers, e.g., collagen fibers, biocompatible fabrics, e.g., collagen fabrics, all with or without other extra cellular matrix macromolecules. Examples of molecules which can form biopolymers and which can be used in the present invention include collagen, laminin, elastin, fibronectin, fibrinogen, gelatin, and polysaccharides. A combination or mixture of one or more biopolymers can be used to form the biocompatible forms. A preferred molecule for biopolymer scaffold production is collagen.<br>
Biopolymers, such as animal proteins and plant polysaccharides, have been used in recent years in a number of diverse applications, including biomedical<br>
applications. According to Friess (European journal of pharmaceutics and bio pharmaceutics 45,113-36,1998) the use of collagen as a biomaterial is currently undergoing regeneration in the field of tissue engineering. Rocha et al (Biomaterials, 23,449-56,2002) and Fujioka et al (Advanced drug delivery Reviews, 31, 247-66,1998) have reported the use of collagen, the major protein of skin and connective tissue, in wound dressings, as well as surgical sponges. Lee et al (International Journal of Pharmaceutics, 221, 1-22, 2001) have reported the use of collagen for tissue engineering including skin replacement, bone substitutes, and artificial blood vessels and valves. They also have reported that open porous structure of the collagen sponge has a great potential for the delivery of biologically active agents such as growth factors, drugs, cytokines, etc. and other therapeutic agents. The purified collagen material can be engineered into a variety of tissue matrices for biomedical applications. These tissue matrices can be in the porous, tubular, membrane, filament and fibrillar forms. Roche et al (Biomaterials, 22, 9 -18, 2001) have reported the use of cross linked collagen sponges seeded with fetal bovine chondrocytes for cartilage tissue engineering.<br>
Collagen has been identified as an excellent biomaterial for medical application primarily because of its inherent compatibility with human body. Ries et al (U.S. Pat. No. 4,066,083) have disclosed the procedure for the preparation of collagen solution from pigskin. The skin is finely divided, degreased using detergent, washed, and digested with pepsin to give a viscous suspension, and the collagen precipitated by addition of saturated salt solution. The precipitate is suspended in acid, re precipitated as a fibrous white precipitate in salt solution, washed as many times as desired, and desalted by washing with alcohol. The purified collagen is then<br>
suspended in acid solution and freeze-dried. It is sterilized by gamma-irradiation, which may degrade or cross link the preparation.<br>
Ho et al (Journal of controlled release, 77, 2001, 97-105) have reported the preparation of telopeptide poor collagen from porcine skin. The collagen was obtained by acetone treatment to remove fat, followed by homogenisation and digestion with pepsin at pH 2.0 for a desired period. The pH of the supernatant was adjusted to 10.0 with sodium hydroxide to inactivate and then it was adjusted to pH 7.0 with H Cl. The precipitated collagen was then dissolved in a 3% acetic acid solution. The collagen thus obtained was used for the preparation of collagen gels.<br>
Depending on the characteristics, it may be of different types, which may range from Type-I to Type-XIV. A preferred combination of collagen types includes collagen type I, collagen type III, and collagen type IV. Preferred mammalian tissues for extraction of pure collagenous substance in respect of making biopolymer for medical applications include entire mammalian fetuses, e.g., porcine fetuses, dermis, tendon, muscle and connective tissue. As a source of collagen, fetal tissues are advantageous because the collagen in the fetal tissues is not as heavily crosslinked as in adult tissues. Thus, when the collagen is extracted using acid extraction, a greater percentage of intact collagen molecules is obtained from fetal tissues in comparison to adult tissues. Fetal tissues also include various molecular factors, which are present in normal tissue at different stages of animal development<br>
Roberts et al (Advances in Drug Delivery Reviews, 54: 459-76, 2002) reported that Polyethylene glycol (PEG) is a highly investigated polymer for the covalent modification of biological macromolecules and surfaces for many pharmaceutical and biotechnological applications. In the modification of biological macromolecules, peptides and proteins are of extreme importance. Reasons for<br>
PEGylation (i.e. the covalent attachment of PEG) of peptides and proteins are numerous and include shielding of antigenic and immunogenic epitopes, shielding receptor-mediated uptake by the reticuloendothelial system (RES), and preventing recognition and degradation by proteolytic enzymes. PEG conjugation also increases the apparent size of the polypeptide, thus reducing the renal filtration and altering bio distribution. An important aspect of PEGylation is the incorporation of various PEG functional groups that are used to attach the PEG to the peptide or protein.<br>
According to Sachols (Biomaterials, 24, 1487-97, 2003) collagen may be the ideal scaffold material as it is the major component of the extra cellular matrix. Therefore, it has a more native surface, relative to synthetic polymers, which favors cellular attachment as well as being chemotactic to cells and. Furthermore, collagen substrates can modify the morphology, migration and in certain cases the differentiation of cells. These properties of collagen emphasize its significance in tissue regeneration and its value as a scaffold material. However, to date, collagen scaffolds have been fabricated into foam structures via the freeze-drying and critical point drying techniques. Therefore, the diffusion constraints arising from the scaffold foam design does not allow cell migration deep into to the scaffold.<br>
There are a very few scaffolds reported in the literature involving collagen. Silver et al (U.S. Pat. No. 4,970,298) have reported a biodegradable collagen matrix exhibiting application as a wound implant. The matrix is formed by freeze drying an aqueous dispersion containing collagen, cross-linking the collagen via two cross-linking steps and freeze-drying the cross-linked matrix. The matrix may also contain hyaluronic acid and fibronectin.<br>
Liu, et al (US patent, 5,972,385) have reported a Collagen-polysaccharide matrix for bone and cartilage repair where in the matrix and a method for preparing it<br>
are provided to support the growth of tissue, such as bone, cartilage or soft tissue. A polysaccharide is reacted with an oxidizing agent to open sugar rings on the polysaccharide to form aldehyde groups. The aldehyde groups are reacted to form covalent linkages to collagen.<br>
Li et al (US Patent, 5,206,028) have reported the preparation of dense collagen membrane matrices for medical uses where in the invention was directed to collagen membranes having physical and biological properties, which make them suitable and desirable for medical uses, particularly as a periodontal barrier. The membranes are characterized by having surface roughness morphology similar to leather and are translucent. Moreover, these membranes do not swell appreciably upon being wetted so as to maintain their overall bulk density.<br>
The above bio absorbable scaffolds implants were prepared by suspending the material in a solvent followed by either freeze-drying or solvent drying. However, the major limitation associated with these processes is that it is generally difficult to control the pore size and density of sponge materials made in this way. Moreover, the resorption of these scaffolds is slowed drastically by chemical cross-linking of the biopolymer. The resulting bio polymeric scaffold is liable to be associated with some immune reactions, while using as implant, as well as do not hold the entrapped bioactive molecules for long periods. Another limitation is that these scaffolds are principally prepared by lyophilizing or freeze drying, which is not a cost-effective method of manufacturing. Alternatively, freeze-drying the construct can kill the cells of the scaffolds. Freeze drying eliminates living material, but leaves the deposited proteins in their natural states.<br>
he main object of this present invention is to provide a process for the preparation of a biopolymer scaffold for medical applications, which obviates the limitations as stated above.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a process to ensure that the biopolymer molecule is stabilized during the process<br>

Still another object of the present invention is to provide a process to ensure that the preparation of the scaffold is highly cost effective method by avoiding the freeze-drying.<br>

The process of the present invention is described below in detail.<br>
The biopolymer solution is prepared by the following conventional method.<br>
A source of biopolymer tissue is washed well in water and chopped into smaller pieces, which are minced at 10-20°C. The minced material is then scoured using min. 0.2% w/w of a surfactant, on the weight of the minced tissue, at a temperature of max. 40° C. The scoured mass is then slimed with minimum 0. 2% of sliming agent at 30-40°C. The slimed mass is then washed thoroughly to make the same free from non-biopolymeric particles, fat and other chemicals. The resulting stock is treated with min. 0.5-2% w/w, of a proteolytic enzyme on the weight of the minced tissue at 2-8° C for 12-48 hours. The pH of the bath is adjusted in the range of 2-3.5.<br>
The enzyme treated stock is then homogenised using a conventional homogeniser at a temperature of max. 37° C and diluted with 150 - 400% v/v, water to form a collagen solution. The viscous solution, thus formed, is treated with min. 5% of a precipitant on the volume of the biopolymer solution with continuous stirring. The resulting suspension is separated conventionally by centrifuging in the range of 10000 - 20000 rpm at 4-8° C and the precipitated biopolymer is dissolved in 200-400% v/v of an acid at a pH in the range of 2- 4. The homogenous solution, thus obtained, is dialysed against di sodium hydrogen phosphate solution. The dialysate is centrifuged at 10000- 20000 rpm and the precipitate is redissolved in 0.5M acetic acid and dialysed against distilled water for 10-48 hours to get pure biopolymer solution.<br>
he biopolymer solution having concentration in the range of 5-10%w/v, as prepared by the above process, is treated with not less than 1 % w/v of glycol and 0.02 - 0.2%w/v of alkaline earth metal chloride, optionally in the presence of not more than 5% of macromolecules necessary for cell growth, morphogenesis, differentiation, and tissue building, that includes but not limited to growth factors, extracellular matrix proteins, proteoglycans, glycosaminoglycans, polysaccharides, living cells, either individually or in any combination, at a temperature in the range of 4-37°C. The resulting solution is homogenized by known method at a speed of not less than 6500 rpm for a period of 1-5 minutes at a temperature not exceeding 37°C to form a viscous frothy mass, which is treated with 0.2-1% v/v of conventional cross linker and optionally not more than 5% w/v of pharmacologically active compound at a temperature not exceeding 40°C, preferably below 37°C. The resulting solution is again subjected to homogenization by known method at a speed of not less than 6500rpm for a period of 1-5 minutes at a temperature not exceeding 37°C.

1.	It is a simple method to prepare a biopolymer scaffold useful for drug delivery,<br>
wound dressing and tissue regeneration applications,<br>
2.	The glycol used in the preparation of the scaffold stabilizes the porous structure<br>
without   deactivating   the   biological   properties   of  collagen.   These   porous<br>
composite materials could function as a scaffold to organize tissue in-growth.<br>
3.	The alkaline metal chloride salt ensures that the scaffold texture is otherwise soft<br>
and also allows absorbing extra water, maintaining moisture and fastening the<br>
drying process of the scaffold.<br>
4.	The scaffold can be placed at the tumor or disease site to deliver a drug at dose<br>
levels considerably stronger than the body would normally tolerate with a<br>
systemic delivery approach. After drug delivery, the open cell structure of the<br>
implant remains for a period of time to promote regeneration of healthy tissues<br>
5.	The scaffold is highly porous, flexible and has better stability.<br>
6.	The scaffold is porous and allows faster tissue in growth.<br>
7.	The product of this process is an economically viable method to prepare medical<br>
grade scaffold.<br>
8.	The biodegradable biopolymer scaffold can be used for entrapment of different<br>
drugs which facilitate the controlled release of the entrapped drugs.<br>
9.	Effective cross-linking incorporated in the process helps avoiding degradation of<br>
the final scaffold.<br>
10.	The method of preparing the scaffold if very cost effective.<br>
11.	The soluble collagen, which is obtained as an intermediate product while making<br>
the scaffold by the present process, has by itself a very high demand as a<br>
component in skin care products like creams, shampoo etc. in the cosmetic and<br>
pharmaceutical industry.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
