Field of the Invention:<br>
The present invention relates to a process for producing cyclopropanecarboxylates.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
There have been known a production method of carboxylic acid ester from a carboxylic acid and an alcohol using a protonic acid catalyst.

A complex comprising a compound comprising an element of Group 4 of the Periodic Table of Elements and a compound having a ligating property such as tetrahydrofuran and tetramethylethylenediamine may also be<br><br>
usea.<br>
Although any amount of the compound comprising an element of Group 4 of the Periodic Table of Elements may be used, it is normally catalytic and preferably around 0.001 to 200 mole % per mol of the cyclopropanecarboxylic acid (1), more preferably within the range of around 0.1 to 20 mole %, and still more preferably within the range of around 0.1 to 10 mole %.<br>
The reaction of the cyclopropanecarboxylic acids (1) with the monohydroxy compound (2) in the presence of the catalyst of the present invention is usually conducted in an inert gas atmosphere such as argon and nitrogen. The reaction may be performed under a normal pressure, a pressurized pressure, or a reduced pressure. Preferably, the reaction is performed under a normal pressure or a reduced pressure. In addition, it is preferable to perform reaction while continuously removing water, which is formed as a byproduct of dehydration reaction, from the reaction system by such a method as distillation or the like.<br>
The reaction may be performed in the absence of a solvent or in a solvent. The solvent that may be used includes: halogenated hydrocarbons such as dichloromethane, chloroform, and 1, 2-dichloroethane, aliphatic hydrocarbons such as hexane, heptane, octane, nonane or the like; aromatichydrocarbons such as benzene, toluene, xylene, chlorobenzene or the like; and ether solvents such as diethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran or the like. By-produced water may be removed from the reaction system by using a solvent that forms an azeotrope with the byproduct water.<br>
Although a reaction temperature is not particularly defined, it is preferably within a range of around 20 to around 200 'C.<br><br>
The catalyst may be removed by washing the reaction mixture withwater or acidic water makes, and the cyciopropanecarboxy late esters (1) can be isolated by performing normal operation such as distillation, recrystallization, and column chromatography, if necessary, from the reaction mixtures.<br>

Detailed Description of the Invention:<br>
[0001]<br>
Field of the Invention:<br>
The present invention relates to a production method of cyclopropanecarboxylate esters. [0002] Prior Art:<br>
As a general synthetic method of ester compounds f romcyclopropanecarboxylic acids and various kinds of alcohols, there has been a wellknown method for providing a desired ester compound, which comprises converting corresponding cyclopropanecarboxylic acid to its acid chloride, and then reacting the same with a respective monohydroxy compound.<br>
This method, however, was not necessarily efficient as an industrial production method because it required a lengthy steps. [0003]<br>
Another method for producing the ester that has been proposed involves only one step, in which cyclopropanecarboxylic acid and a respective monohydroxy compound ate dehydrated. In general, dehydration is performed in the presence of an acid catalyst. A production method using<br><br>
sulfuric acid as a catalyst is reported in Japanese Patent Laid-open Publication HEX No. 9-188649, and also reported is another method of using p-toluenesulfonic acid as a catalyst in the Japanese Patent Laid-open Publication HEI No. 11-228491.<br>
However, since such methods of using mineral acid or organic acid having strong acidity cause significant coloring due to a side reaction, and also take a long reaction time, these methods were not necessarily efficient as industrial production methods.<br>
In the Japanese Patent Laid-open Publication SHO No. 60-64945, there is reported a production method of useing dicyclohexylcarbodiimide or diisopropylcarbodiimide as a dehydrating agent.<br>
However, the dehydrating agent used in the production method is expensive, and a necessary amount thereof is more than the equivalent amount of cyclopropanecarboxylic acid, which has made the method not necessarily efficient as an industrial production method.<br>
[0004]<br>
Problems to be Solved by the Invention:<br>
The present invention is to provide a production method of desired cyclopropanecarboxylate esters in excellent yieldby performing dehydration of cyclopropanecarboxylic acids and a monohydroxy compound in the presence of a compound of an element of Group 4 of the Periodic Table of Elements. [0005] Means for Solving the Problems:<br>

[0039] Example 6<br>
The reaction was performed in a similar manner as in Example 1 except that 8.9 mg of tetrakis (diethylamino) hafnium was charged instead of 8. 0 mg of hafnium tetrachloride in Example 1. The reaction mixture was analyzed with gas chromatography,   and   the   result   indicated   that<br>
(3-phenoxyphenyl)methyl 2,2-dimethyl-3-(2-methyl-l-propenyl) cyclopropanecarboxylate was obtained in a yield of 93%<br>
(selectivity of 99%) based on the raw material alcohol.<br>
[0040]<br>
Comparative Example 1<br>
The reaction was performed in a similar manner as in Example 1 except that 12.5 mg of concentrated sulfuric acid was charged instead of 8 . 0 mg of hafnium tetrachloride in Example 1. The reaction mixture was analyzed with gas chromatography, and the result indicated that  (3-phenoxyphenyl)- methyl<br><br>
2, 2-diinethyl-3- (2-methyl-l-propenyl) cyclopropanecarboxylate was obtained in a yield of 81% {selectivity of 37%) based on the raw material alcohol,<br>
[0041]<br>
Comparative Example 2<br>
The reaction was performed in a similar manner as in Example 1 except that 23.7 mg of p-toluenesulfonic acid was charged instead of 3.0 mg of hafnium tetrachloride in Example 1. The reaction mixture was analyzed with gas chromatography, and the result indicated that {3-phenoxyphenyl)- methyl 2,2-dimethyl-3-(2-methyl-l-propenyl)cyclopropanecarboxylate was obtained in a yield of 61% (selectivity of 93%) based on the raw material alcohol.<br>
