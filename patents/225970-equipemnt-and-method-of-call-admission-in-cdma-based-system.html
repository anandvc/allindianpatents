				<td>Equipment and Method of<br>
Call Admission in CDMA Based System<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates generally to a control method for CDMA systems<br>
in mobile communication field, and more particularly, to a method of uplink and<br>
downlink traffic payioad power increment estimation and admission control for<br>
CDMA systems such as WCDMA, CDMA2000, TD-SCDMA, TD-CDMA and the<br>
like.<br>
Background Art of the Invention<br>
2G mobile communication systems, regardless of GSM or 18-95 have a<br>
common characteristic that, with regard to the single voice service, every channel has<br>
a fixed transmission rate and the number of channels in a sector corresponds to the<br>
throughput.<br>
To satisfy the ongoing growth of the demand for data traffic development,<br>
mobile Internet, or namely the 3rd mobile communication system (3G), has become<br>
the highlight in recent research and. development activities. In addition to traditional<br>
voice traffic, it's also necessary for 3G to carry pacicet data traffic corresponding to<br>
the Internet. The transmission method and the requirement of the packet data traffic<br>
are greatly different from voice traffic, e.g. the traffic generation rule is different, the<br>
transmission BER and delay are different too, which cause the difference in transfer<br>
formal and transmission control method for packet data.<br>
All 3G CDMA systems (WCDMA, CDMA2000, TD-SCDMA, TD-CDMA and<br>
so on) fall into the category of 3G technical standards, and use code sequences to<br>
distinguish different users, which is similar to narrowband CDMA systems (such as<br>
TS-95 system) in theory. However, the transmission scheme and system control<br>
method in 3G CDMA systems are greatly different from those in IS-95 system.<br>
Although there is no uniform method to define it in the word currently, the system<br>
power capacity payload is not measured with channel number am more, but<br>
represented by power or data throughput. Meanwhile. WCDMA has three main<br><br>
features with support for broadband high-rate, aggregate traffic bearing and variable<br>
rate transmission. Since the throughput power capacity payload of 3G CDMA systems<br>
is 'soft', which means the power capacity payload varies with different traffic access,<br>
so it can be very difficult to judge whether the system satisfies the technical standard.<br>
In a practical CDMA system, the key factor is the power, and it's of practical<br>
significance to take the throughout power as the payload power of the cell. But the<br>
payload power of the cell doesn't have a fixed relationship with the throughput power<br>
capacity payload of the cell, that is, both the channel number and the throughput are<br>
not fixed.<br>
In a WCDMA system, although the bandwidth is fairly broad, but for the<br>
ongoing-increasing traffic demand, the radio power capacity payload over the air is<br>
rather limited. When a user initiates a call request for radio access, an admission<br>
control must be carried out in order to prevent the system payload power from<br>
exceeding the threshold for stable operation and thus leading to system collapse.<br>
3GPP passed and published the technical specification for radio interference -<br>
Release 99' version in March. 1999, and keeps on modifying since then. But 3GPP<br>
does not work out a uniform standard for the admission control methods for WCDMA<br>
system so far, and the current system control methods are developed by respective<br>
companies, based on the standard.<br>
The admission control procedure works as: first, measure the current payload<br>
power of the cell (base station) accurately, and derive the remaining (available)<br>
payload power capacity of the system cell (base station); next, predict and estimate<br>
the uplink and downlink payload power increments of the call traffic (including new<br>
call traffic and the handover call traffic) respectively; then, compare the traffic<br>
payload power increments in the uplink and downlink directions with the remaining<br>
(available) payload power capacity of the cell; admit the call traffic if the remaining<br>
payload power capacity is sufficient, and reject it otherwise. With the accurate call<br>
admission control, more users or traffics can be admitted under the precondition that<br>
the system payload power allows (the system runs steadily), and thus to maintain<br>
lower call loss rate and lower call drop rate, and achieve higher QoS and higher<br>
system power capacity payload.<br>
3G mobile communication systems have another important feature with support<br><br>
for asymmetrical traffic, i.e. data rates in uplink and downlink directions are not equal,<br>
even the data rate in some direction can be zero. In this way, an admission control<br>
(congestion control or access control) should be necessary in uplink and downlink<br>
directions respectively. If the resource requirement (power capacity payload) for the<br>
call traffic in either direction is not satisfied, the call traffic can't be admitted.<br>
Another feature of 3G mobile communication systems is to provide a user with<br>
communication of several traffics simultaneously, such as making call and meanwhile<br>
accessing the Internet. Therefore, a traffic call is taken as a fundamental calling unit.<br>
For an UDD (that is Unconstrained Delay Data) PS (Packet Switch) traffic,<br>
when the traffic call is requesting for resource, wireless data communication can be<br>
canned out by exploiting the resource in a manner of queuing and waiting. When an<br>
admission decision is made, the minimum transfer rate of the UDD traffic (determined<br>
by the system transfer format) is taken to estimate the payload power increment. This<br>
is a 'soft' decision process.<br>
For a CS (Circuit Switch) traffic, such as voice, movie and other multimedia<br>
traffics, an admission decision must be made in a short time period based on the<br>
resource that the traffic applies for, and the requirements for transfer rate, quality and<br>
delay have to be satisfied thoroughly, otherwise, reject it. This is a 'hard' decision<br>
process.<br>
An admission control is carried out during traffic call procedure. When each<br>
traffic call applies for radio interface resource, real-time and dynamic measurement<br>
must be conducted on the payload power of the current system cell (base station), to<br>
get the remaining payload power capacity available for the system, and estimate the<br>
call traffic, evaluate the impact of admitting the traffic upon the system. The general<br>
criteria is to admit the call and allocate the radio resource and the relevant parameters<br>
for it if the remaining payload power capacity can satisfy the resource requirement of<br>
the call traffic, and reject it otherwise. However, the traffic carried in 3G mobile<br>
communication systems is aggregate traffic, which includes real-time voice traffic and<br>
UDD PS traffic, hence the accurate estimation and the valid judgment must be made<br>
with respect to different characteristics of the traffic, thus the system power capacity<br>
payload can be taken advantage of sufficiently under the precondition of guaranteeing<br>
smooth system operation, and thus to achieve efficient utilization of radio resource.<br><br>
Currently, the method for predicting payload power increment of the call traffic is<br>
based on the throughput, which can be referred to "WCDMA for UMTS: Radio Access<br>
for Third Generation Mobile Communications", Harri Holma, et al. The currently<br>
used method for predicting the traffic payload power increment does not take power<br>
as the core. And the predicted payload power increment of the call traffic is not direct<br>
Tx/Rx power increment, and the prediction does not consider the influence of the<br>
multiple access interference, thus it is not highly corresponding to the practical system,<br>
neither is utility nor accurate, which easily leads to misjudgment of the admission<br>
control. In published patent documents, there is no admission control method for<br>
aggregate traffic and asymmetric traffic yet. Only some related patents, such as<br>
US5687171 "Device and Method for allocating radio channels in a CDMA system",<br>
which is the nearest method, it is based on the criteria that a radio channel is allocated<br>
if the remnant are higher than the required power after measuring the Rx signal<br>
strength at the base station, calculating the allowable remnant, estimating the power<br>
required for call. This is the typical admission control method for single traffic and<br>
symmetric traffic in 2G, and only the uplink Rx signal strength is measured at the base<br>
station. In these methods, neither power climb nor the respective admission control of<br>
asymmetric traffic on the uplink and downlink is taken into account when calculating<br>
the power required for call traffic. Since the methods for measurement and calculation<br>
of the remnant of the payload power are different on uplink and downlink, the<br>
requirement for complicated diversity in 3G systems can't be satisfied if not<br>
considering the particularity of non-realtime traffic admission and the traffic priority.<br>
In 3G communication systems, since the carried traffic may be asymmetric, that<br>
is, the transfer rates for uplink and downlink are different, the admission control has<br>
to be carried out on uplink and downlink respectively. Because WCDMA system is a<br>
self-interfering system, the uplink power capacity payload is interference-constrained<br>
while the downlink power capacity payload is power-constrained. The downlink Tx<br>
power of the cell (base station) equipments is constrained by the physical facilities<br>
and accordingly the maximum downlink Tx power is limited, hence the power on<br>
each carrier frequency in each sector is generally not more than 20W. Thus, for<br>
downlink admission control, first, it's necessary to measure the downlink payload<br>
power of the cell very precisely, then to analyze the rate, traffic type (real-time or<br><br>
non-real-time traffic), SNR and so on in QoS during the traffic call, and calculate<br>
the predictor AP of the Tx power required for the call traffic, and then perform<br>
admission control. The call traffic will be admitted when the remaining downlink<br>
resource is sufficient for use, and rejected it otherwise. The procedure for the uplink is<br>
similar: first, measure the uplink payload power of the cell -the total Rx interference<br>
power, predict (estimate) the Rx power increment of the call traffic; and then judge<br>
whether the available remaining power capacity payload of the cell is sufficient, and<br>
perform admission control. Power climb caused by multiple access interference must<br>
be considered when performing uplink and downlink admission control.<br>
When estimating the downlink traffic payload power increment, it's very hard to<br>
estimate the traffic payload power increment, which is a well known problem to be<br>
settled because the location of the mobile station and downlink path loss usually can<br>
not be known accurately. When the measurement of downlink path loss can be utilized,<br>
the downlink path loss can be used, but we still need to consider the power climb<br>
issue caused by the downlink non-orthogonal factor, which increases the extra power<br>
of its traffic channel and also leads to extra increase in the total downlink Tx power,<br>
and thus causes the downlink transmission ability to be saturated and ultimately<br>
collapse due to the fact that each user's communication quality can't meet the<br>
requirement. The admission error only produces influence once and doesn't<br>
accumulate, but significant estimation error will increase the call loss rate and thus<br>
decrease the system operation efficiency.<br>
On the downlink, a cell generally corresponds to a linear power amplifier, it has<br>
only 20W Tx power ability, while downlink admission control mainly concerns on the<br>
remaining power capacity payload - that is, whether the power is sufficient for<br>
transmission.<br>
When estimating the uplink traffic payload power increment, the multiple access<br>
interference between users is the primary concern. All users send the power towards<br>
the base station simultaneously, which is a one-to-multiple communication. On the<br>
uplink, the spreading codes for distinguishing different users are not orthogonal<br>
entirely, so there will be a multiple access interference between users, which<br>
deteriorates the communication quality. The more the users, the higher the<br>
interference will be. When the user number reaches a certain value so as to cause the<br><br>
total Rx power too high, the interference between users is too serious and the<br>
communication quality will decrease drastically. Under closed-loop power control<br>
mechanism, the Tx power of each user climbs alternately, which leads to non-linear<br>
climb in the power and the total uplink interference power increase dramatically, and<br>
ultimately, system collapse occurs when the total Rx interference power exceeds the<br>
limit of the receiving circuit.<br>
The total uplink Rx interference power can't exceed the threshold, and the<br>
uplink admission control mainly concerns on the remaining power capacity payload<br>
(interference remnant) - that is, whether the total Rx power exceeds the limit of the<br>
system.<br>
Based on the above characteristics and requirements, when a call traffic requests<br>
for accessing the radio access network system, it need to consider both the<br>
requirements of the uplink and downlink traffic and the uplink and downlink payload<br>
power situations of the system, and the admission control is conducted in uplink and<br>
downlink directions respectively.<br>
The current admission control method does not take into account the power<br>
climb issue when computing the power required for the call traffic, does not consider<br>
the admission control for asymmetric traffic in uplink and downlink directions<br>
respectively, and does not consider the particularity of the non-real-time traffic<br>
admission and the traffic priority as well, so it can't satisfy the traffic requirements of<br>
the next generation mobile communication system.<br>
One object of the present invention is to provide an accurate admission control<br>
equipment and a method for CDMA systems, wherein the power climb is taken into<br>
serious account when the power required for the call traffic is calculated, admission<br>
control for asymmetric traffic is addressed respectively on uplink and downlink,<br>
different methods are used for uplink and downlink measurement and calculation of<br>
the payload power remnant, and the admission of non real-time traffic and the traffic<br>
priority are processed differently, thus to improve the effect on increasing the system<br>
operation efficiency, reducing call blocking rate and call drop rate.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
The procedure of the admission control works as: when a call traffic requests for<br><br><br>
access, classify the traffic type, with regard to non-real-time traffic, take minimum<br>
non-zero rate, and get the transfer rate requirement for the call traffic, measure the<br>
uplink and downlink payload power of the cell in real time, consider the uplink<br>
multiple access interference and downlink power climb caused by non-orthogonality,<br>
estimate the payload power increment of the call traffic and perform admission<br>
control respectively in uplink and downlink directions to adapt to the access for<br>
asymmetric traffic and lower the call loss rate (blocking rate), and improve the system<br>
operation efficiency under the precondition that the system is stable.<br>

predefined value.<br>
Wherein the second predefined value is equal to the path loss of the equivalent<br>
radius calculated by substituting the product of the maximum coverage radius of the<br>

method is proposed for a CDMA system, the CDMA system includes at least one base<br>
station, at least one mobile station requesting for accessing the cell for which the base<br>
station serves, and the control means containing the information about the mobile<br>
stations for which the base station in the cell is serving and other information in the<br>
cell such as the rating payload for different traffic in the cell; wherein the mobile<br>

In accordance with still another aspect of the present invention, an admission<br>
control apparatus is proposed for a CDMA system, the CDMA system includes at<br>
least one base station, at least one mobile station requesting for accessing the cell for<br>
which the base station serves, and a control means containing the information about<br>
the mobile stations for which the base station in the cell is serving and other<br>
information in the cell such as the rating payload for different traffics in the cell;<br>
wherein the mobile station requesting for accessing the cell for which the base station<br>
serves initiates at least one traffic request such as a non real-time or a real-time traffic<br>
request to the system; said admission control means comprising:<br>
receiving means, for receiving the call request for accessing the cell for which<br>
the base station serves from the mobile station;<br>
parameters acquiring means, for acquiring the parameters of said mobile station,<br>
including the SNR Eb/No, uplink: source rate Rup, user ID and traffic type required by<br><br>
said at least one traffic;<br>
control means, for determining whether the uplink throughput can satisfy the<br>
uplink requirement of the traffic according to the uplink rate Rup: if yes, establish<br>
uplink; otherwise, reject the traffic request.<br>
Wherein the control means includes:<br>
Rx power determining means, for determining the total uplink Rx (interference)<br>
power of the cell, which is required by the uplink rate Rup and derived from the<br>
measured data groups reported by the base station, according to the uplink rate Rup,<br>
and determining the equivalent Rx power required by the uplink rate Rup;<br>

uplink requirement of the traffic according to the total Rx power allowed by the<br>
payload of the cell.<br>
Alternatively, the Rx power determining means further determines the<br>
equivalent total Rx power required after providing service to the uplink rate Rup; the<br>
judging means satisfies the uplink requirement of the traffic when the equivalent total<br>
Rx power is less than or equal to the total Rx power allowed by the payload of the<br>
cell.<br>
Also, the Rx power determining means calculates the equivalent throughput<br>
corresponding to the call traffic according to the total Rx power; gets the total<br>
throughput by adding the equivalent throughput and the uplink rate Rup of the traffic;<br>
derives a corresponding equivalent total Rx power by calculating the total throughput.<br>
Additionally, the judging means subtracts the total uplink Rx (interference)<br>
power (measured value) of the cell from the equivalent total Rx power, to get the<br>
uplink Rx power increment of the call traffic; subtracts the measured uplink Rx total<br>
(interference) power of the cell from the absolute value of the Rx total power allowed<br>
by the payload of the cell, to get the uplink remaining capacity of the cell; and then<br>
judges whether the uplink remaining capacity is above the third predefined value. As a<br>
result, admit the uplink traffic if yes and reject it otherwise.<br>

available remaining downlink power capacity payload according to the above<br>
extracted parameters;<br>
Step D: if the available remaining downlink power capacity payload of the<br>
system cell is above the downlink payload power increment of the traffic, setting the<br>
downlink admission permission as 'true', and turning to Step E to go on with uplink<br>
admission control; otherwise, returning to Step A to process the next traffic call;<br>
Step E: calculating the uplink payload power increment of the call Traffic and the<br>
available remaining uplink power capacity payload of the cell;<br>
Step F: if the available remaining uplink power capacity payload of the system<br>
cell is above the uplink payload power increment of the traffic, setting the uplink<br>
admission permission as 'true', and turning to Step G; otherwise, setting the uplink<br>
admission permission as 'false', and returning to Step A to process the next traffic<br>
call;<br>

Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
Further descriptions will be given below to the present invention, in conjunction<br>
with accompanying drawings.<br>
Fig. 1 is a schematic diagram illustrating the payload power measurement for the<br>
cell of the base station (Node B), where every base station can have 1, 3, or 6 cells<br>
(sectors). Every base station has one cell when omni-directional antenna is applied, 3<br>
cells when 120° antenna is applied, and 6 cells when 60° antenna is applied. Every cell<br>
has two antennas, wherein one antenna (101) is connected to LPA (105) in the<br>
transmission portion and to LNA (110) in the reception portion via duplexer (102),<br>
and another antenna (108) is connected directly to the Rx total power measurement<br>
circuit (110). The cell payload power measurements in the base station mainly clarify<br>
as the measurement of the total Rx power and the measurement of the total Tx power.<br>
The total Rx power measurement reporting module (109) reports the output of the<br>
total Rx power measurement circuit (110) to RNC (Radio Network Controller) via<br>
signaling channel as required, and similarly, the total Tx power measurement<br>
reporting module (103) also reports the output of the total Tx power measurement<br>
circuit (104) to RNC via signaling channel as required. The transmitted RF signal is a<br>
signal which is obtained by passing the signal generated by baseband circuit (107)<br>
through the IF transmission processing circuit (106). And similarly, the received<br>
signal is processed by the baseband reception processing circuit (113) after being<br>
processed by the EF reception processing circuit (112).<br>
Fig.2 is a schematic diagram illustrating the information pass-channel in the call<br>
admission control. First, UE or namely mobile equipment (201) possibly reports the<br><br>
measured downlink path loss to the RRM (Radio Resource Manger) module in RNC<br>
(203) via RRC (Radio Resource Control) signaling channel (202), for the RRM<br>
module to calculate the Tx power required by the downlink. The common<br>
measurement functional module (204) in the base station (Node B) reports the total<br>
uplink Rx power of the cell to RNC (203) via Iub interface (205). This is the current<br>
payload power of the cell, and it is taken as the basis for admission control judgment<br>
to conduct CAC (Call Admission Control).<br>
Fig.3 is the main flowchart illustrating call processing with the method<br>
according to the present invention, which includes the main control procedures for<br>
admission control of uplink and downlink asymmetric traffics. First, judge whether<br>
the downlink rate requirement for the traffic is zero. If non-zero, start downlink<br>
admission control procedure: processing the non real-time and real-time traffics<br>
respectively, with major difference in that non real-time traffic can be processed after<br>
queuing and waiting for a while and access at the minimum rate, but real-time traffic<br>
almost can't wait and requires rate guaranteed. Then, call and use the downlink<br>
admission control processing program. After the downlink admission control is<br>
accomplished, uplink the admission control procedure will be carried on, wherein the<br>
uplink admission control also distinguishes real-time and non real-time traffics first<br>
and then processes them respectively, which is similar to the downlink admission<br>
control procedure.<br>
Fig.4 is a detail flowchart for the downlink call admission processing with the<br>
method according to the present invention, wherein a prediction method is adopted by<br>
combining the measurement with the equivalent coverage radius, in order to predict<br>
the power increment and the payload power increment of the downlink traffic during<br>
calling. When there is no measurement reported by the cell (base station), we will<br>
adopt the downlink path loss calculated with the equivalent radius. And the<br>
functionality of measurement report is just optional because it's not necessary for the<br>
cell to report the measurement. The call may be a call initiated from UE in idle status,<br>
a call of newly added traffic in connection, a handover call or a call from the wired<br>
network side. RRM in the higher layer of RNC acquires the QoS parameters and<br>
measurement parameters of the call traffic from RRC signaling, and obtains the traffic<br>
type (voice or data), traffic rate, BER requirement (SNR Eb/No requirement) and<br><br><br>
priority from the QoS parameters, and obtains the current payload power and the<br>
downlink path loss of the system from the measurement parameters, thus to predict<br>
the power increment AP of the call. Then, the final power increment of the traffic<br>
can be derived by further considering the influence of the non-orthogonal factor<br>
caused by radio multipath environment and the power climb amount, and then convert<br>
it into the downlink payload power increment A n. Only in the condition that the<br>
current payload power of the system is judged accurately, the admission control can<br>
be achieved correctly. With regards to the priority of the call traffic, the admission<br>
control will have two thresholds when judging the payload power threshold of the<br>
system, and the difference between the two thresholds is the reserved power capacity<br>
payload for the handover, for use in soft switch, and to guarantee lower call drop rate<br>
in hard switch. In a word, the accurate downlink admission control can be performed<br>
when the downlink path loss is reported, and the admission control can also be<br>
conducted even if it's not reported. When calculating the downlink payload power<br>
increment of the traffic, consider the downlink non-orthogonal factors, the power<br>
climb issue caused thereafter and the traffic priority, and set different admission<br>
thresholds for different priorities, thus to predict accurately the influence of the call<br>
traffic access upon the system, so as to improve the effect on increasing the system<br>
operation efficiency, and reducing the call blocking rate and call drop rate.<br>
Fig.5 illustrates the detailed flowchart for the uplink call admission processing<br>
with the method according to the present invention, which is basically similar to the<br>
downlink call admission procedure, with major difference in that it's not necessary to<br>
consider the path loss issue and the payload power of the cell is completely in<br>
accordance with the power, without being converted into percentage. In uplink<br>
admission control, RRM module in the higher layer of the RNC acquires the QoS<br>
parameters of the call from signaling, obtains the traffic type (voice or data), traffic<br>
uplink rate, BER requirement (SNR Eb/No requirement) and priority from the QoS<br>
parameters, and obtains the current payload power of the system from the<br>
measurement parameters. According to the uplink multiple access interference,<br>
consider the multiple access interference in the case of the current payload power of<br>
the cell, i.e. the power climb caused by multiple access interference, thus to predict<br>
the power increment AP of the call traffic and the payload power increment A n . In<br><br>
this way, the correct admission control can be conducted in the condition that the<br>
current payload power of the cell is judged accurately. Considering the priority of the<br>
call traffic, the admission control will also have two thresholds when judging the<br>
payload power threshold of the system, and the difference between the two thresholds<br>
is the reserved power capacity payload for handover, which is for use in soft switch<br>
and can guarantee lower call drop rate in hard switch. In a word, the uplink admission<br>
control takes multiple access interference into account, wherein the calculation of the<br>
uplink payload power increment of the call traffic considers the power climb caused<br>
by multiple access interference and the traffic priority with different admission<br>
thresholds for different priorities, thus to predict accurately the influence of the call<br>
traffic access upon the system, improve the effect on increasing system operation<br>
efficiency, and lowering the call congestion rate and call drop rate.<br>
Fig.6 illustrates the downlink control device for the call admission control in the<br>
present invention. In CDMA system 600, there are at least one base station 610, at<br>
least one mobile station 620 requesting for accessing the cell for which the base<br>
station serves, a control means 630 containing the information about the mobile<br>
station for which the base station in the cell is serving and other information about the<br>
cell such as the rating payload for different traffic. The downlink control device<br>
including a base station 610 and a control means 630 comprise receiver 650 as the<br>
receiving means, for receiving the call request for accessing the cell for which the<br>
base station serves from mobile station 620. The downlink control device includes a<br>
parameters acquiring means 670, for acquiring parameters of said mobile station 620<br>
from the information received by receiver 650 and the information in control means<br>
630, including but not restricted to, the required SNR Eb/No, uplink source rate Rup<br>
or/and downlink source rate Rdown, user ID and traffic type. The downlink control<br>
device further includes a signal processing means 680 constructed by CPU and its<br>
accessories, for determining the downlink path loss L of the traffic according to the<br>
information acquired by parameters acquiring means 670; determining the downlink<br>
climb power of the system cell according to the information in the control means; and<br>
then calculating the available remaining downlink capacity of the system cell,<br>
according to the determined path loss L, downlink source rate Rdown and the required<br>
SNR Eb/No, and the determined downlink climb power of the system cell. Wherein<br><br><br>
judging means 690 determines whether the downlink can admit the traffic according<br>
to the available remaining downlink capacity of the system cell calculated by<br>
signaling processing means 680. If the traffic can be admitted, the link connection<br>
means establishes downlink with mobile station 620 according to the result<br>
determined by the judging means; otherwise, the traffic request will be rejected. In<br>
practical applications, it's very likely that mobile station 620 only needs to establish<br>
downlink non real-time traffic (such as reception of e-mails and so on) or just to<br>
establish downlink real-time traffic (such as reception of speech notification and so<br>
on). At this moment, only downlink is required to be established.<br>
In the downlink control device, signal processing means 680 further comprises<br>
transmission level determining means 682, climb power determining means 684,<br>
searching means 686 and judging means 688. Wherein transmission level determining<br>
means 682 is for calculating the processing gain and the transmission level required<br>
by the traffic downlink. Climb power determining means 684 determines the<br>
downlink climb power of the call traffic according to the information in the control<br>
means. Searching means 686 searches for the downlink path loss reported by the user<br>
ID latest. Judging means 688 judges whether the path loss is usable and valid: if<br>
usable and valid, taking the reported downlink path loss as the downlink path loss L of<br>
the traffic; otherwise, taking the first predefined value as the downlink path loss L.<br>
Fig.7 displays the uplink control device for the call admission control in the<br>
present invention, in which the parts same as those in Fig.6 are denoted by same<br>
reference numerals. The uplink admission control device 700 comprises: receiving<br>
means 650, parameters acquiring means 670 and control &amp; processing means 710.<br>
Wherein, receiving means 650 receives the call request for accessing the cell for<br>
which the base station serves from the mobile station; parameters acquiring means<br>
670 acquires parameters of said mobile station, including the SNR Eb/No, uplink<br>
source rate Rup, user ID and traffic type required by at least one traffic; control &amp;<br>
processing means 710 determines whether the uplink throughput can satisfy the uplink<br>
requirement of the traffic according to the uplink rate Rup: if yes, establish uplink;<br>
otherwise, reject the traffic request.<br>
Where control &amp; processing means 710 includes Rx power determining means<br>
713 and judging means 716, wherein Rx power determining means 713 determines<br><br><br>
the total uplink Rx (interference) power of the cell required by the uplink rate Rup,<br>
which is obtained from the measured data groups reported by the base station, and<br>
determines the equivalent Rx power required by the uplink rate Rup; judging means<br>
716 determines whether the uplink throughput can satisfy the uplink requirement of<br>
the traffic according to the total Rx power allowed by the payload of the cell. Rx<br>
power determining means 713 also determines the equivalent total Rx power required<br>
after providing service to the uplink rate Rup; and judging means 716 will satisfy the<br>
uplink requirement of the traffic when the equivalent total Rx power is less than or<br>
equal to the total Rx power allowed by the payload of the cell. Additionally, Rx power<br>
determining means 713 calculates the equivalent throughput corresponding to the call<br>
traffic according to the total Rx power; adds the equivalent throughput and the uplink<br>
traffic rate Rup to get the total throughput; and obtains an equivalent total Rx power<br>
corresponding to the total throughput. Judging means 716 subtracts the total uplink<br>
Rx (interference) power (measured value) of the cell from the equivalent total Rx<br>
power, to get the uplink Rx power increment of the call traffic; subtracts the measured<br>
total uplink Rx (interference) power from the absolute value of the total Rx power<br>
allowed by the payload of the cell, to get the uplink remaining capacity of the cell;<br>
and then judges whether the uplink remaining capacity is above the third predefined<br>
value: if yes, admit the traffic; otherwise, reject it.<br>
Then, control &amp; processing means 710 converts the uplink remaining capacity<br>
into the uplink available remaining capacity of the cell according to the requirement<br>
of the reserved capacity requirement for handover. The judging means judges whether<br>
the uplink available remaining capacity is above the traffic payload increment: if yes,<br>
it indicates that the uplink remaining capacity is above the third predefined value.<br>
In practical applications, it's very likely that mobile station 620 only needs to<br>
establish uplink non real-time traffic (such as transmission of e-mails and so on) or<br>
just to establish uplink real-time traffic (such as transmission of voice notification and<br>
so on). At this moment, only uplink is required to be established.<br>
In some practical applications, it's also likely that both uplink and downlink<br>
traffics need to be established, and at this moment, the apparatus should include the<br>
components in Fig.6 and Fig.7.<br><br><br>
Preferred Embodiments of the Invention<br>
The functional blocks of the present invention are embodied in RNC in form of<br>
software, and RNC controls and manages several base stations (cells). In conjunction<br>
with steps in the present invention, an embodiment can give further description as<br>
below:<br>
Step 1: extracting the signal source rate R, the required SNR Eb/No, priority<br>
level and user ID of the call traffic, from the QoS parameters carried by the RAB<br>
(radio access bearer) request of the call traffic (user);<br>
Step 2: checking whether the downlink rate of the call traffic is zero. If not zero,<br>
turn to Step 3 to go on with the downlink admission control; otherwise, turn to Step<br>
14 to start to execute steps for the uplink admission control processing;<br>
Step 3: further extracting the downlink data rate of the call traffic, the required<br>
SNR Eb/No, traffic type (real-time traffic or non real-time traffic) and the calling user<br>
ID from the QoS parameters. From the traffic type, the delay requirement for the<br>
traffic can be known, and the queuing line and the time duration to be waited for<br>
should be taken into account when queuing priority. With user ID, it can be judged<br>
whether the user has any traffic in communication, thus consider the combined<br>
utilization of the radio link, that is, to establish a new radio link or reconfigure the old<br>
radio link. Non real-time traffic takes the minimum transmission rate requirement as<br>
the admission rate.<br>
Step 4: searching the database for the downlink path loss L (dB) reported by the<br>
corresponding user latest with the user ID. In general, during call connection<br>
initialization, the mobile station will measure the downlink path loss and report it to<br>
the RNC. This value must be measured within the last hundreds milliseconds to few<br>
seconds, otherwise it's invalid. For example, if the mobile station moves 6.67 meters<br>
at 120km/h within 200ms, or the time duration can be extended a little, but it will<br>
cause loss of accuracy if moving distance is too long and it is of no practical<br>
significance.<br>
Step 5: judging whether the downlink path loss L is valid, i.e. the non-zero path<br>
loss at a recorded time, and the time difference between the value record time and the<br>
current time is within at most several seconds. Taking the real-time measurement<br><br><br>
value as the path loss and turning to Step 7 for further calculation. Otherwise, turning<br>
to Step 6 to get the approximation of the downlink path loss through estimation.<br>
Step 6: when the measured path loss value losses time validity, take the cell<br>
parameters (antenna height A ho of the base station and the maximum coverage<br>
radius rmax of the cell) and 70.7% of the cell's maximum coverage radius as the<br>
propagation distance parameters, and substitute them into the following equation for<br>
propagation model, to calculate the mean 1, (the approximation of the path loss L) of<br>
the path loss of the equivalent radius, for replacing the path loss I.:<br><br>
Step 7: after the downlink path loss I, is derived in Step 5 or 6, by using the<br>
downlink rate Rdown of the traffic and the required SNR Eb/No. the original value of<br>
the power payload power increment can be calculated by:<br><br>
  dB is the processing gain. R is the traffic rate<br>
with unit as kbps.<br>
White noise power  wherein To is the<br>
absolute ambient temperature (oK), k is Bolt/mann's constant as 1.38 x 1023. K. B is<br>
the communication bandwidth (Hz) and the bandwidth for WDMA system is 5Mhz.<br>
and take Po -103 dBm under normal temperature.<br>
The original value of the predicted transmission power in dB should be<br>
transformed into the absolute value, and the statistical multiplex factor for voice<br>
traffic needs to be considered in conversion. The absolute value (mW) of the original<br>
downlink transmission power required for calculating the call traffic can be given as<br>
follows:<br><br><br>
where v is voice activation factor, being 1.00 for data traffic (non voice traffic)<br>
and 0.67 for voice traffic (symmetric session traffic).<br>
Step 8: Since WCDMA system is a self-interfering system, the multipath<br>
propagation over downlink radio link causes non-orthogonality of the physical code<br>
channels, so that the separation of physical code channels is not complete. And there<br>
are still mutual interferences. That is, non-orthogonality will cause multiple access<br>
interference or noises between physical code channels, and thus the SNR of each<br>
physical code channel is decreased. The more the physical code channels, the higher<br>
the interference will be. To offset the decrease in SNR caused by non-orthogonality, a<br>
power climb amount has to be added. To calculate the downlink power climb amount<br>
after traffic access based on Step 7:<br><br>
where α is the downlink non-orthogonal factor in multipath radio environment,<br>
ranging from 0.1 to 0.4, depending on the specific radio environment.<br>
Step 9: in a practical system, the downlink payload power of the base station<br>
(cell) of the system reported to RNC is a percentage, so we can get the total downlink<br>
Tx power P0 by using the reported payload power n (%)through practical<br>
measurement and the maximum Tx power Pmax (mW) of the base station (cell), so as<br>
to further calculate the power climb of the base station (cell):<br><br>
Due to the influence of downlink non-orthogonal factors in WCDMA system,<br>
multiple access interference exists between the physical code channels. If a user<br>
(traffic) accesses when a power has reached balance, the transmission power of the<br>
user will cause the SNR of other physical code channels to decrease and cause the<br>
transmission power of other channels to increase somewhat. Estimation of the total Tx<br>
power when taking into account power climbs after the traffic access can be<br>
calculated with the following equation:<br><br>
Step 10: the case of the power climb caused by call traffic (user) access is<br><br><br>
considered in the above, the payload power increment caused by traffic access can be<br>
predicted with the following equation:<br><br>
Step 11: reserving the power capacity payload required for soft switch,<br>
according to the requirement for soft switch, to avoid call drop and significant<br>
decrease in the system QoS when the user can't get enough power capacity payload<br>
during soft switch. Considering that the downlink power capacity payload reserved<br>
for soft switch is 50% and with a low PAR (Peak-to-Average power Ratio) the<br>
payload power for guaranteeing smooth system operation is 90%, the admission<br>
threshold for non-handover traffic call is 60% while that for handover traffic call is<br>
90%, and the available remaining power capacity payload of the cell can be further<br>
determined accordingly. That is: the available remaining power capacity payload for<br>
non-handover call traffic can be calculated by   ; while<br>
the available remaining power capacity payload for handover call traffic can be<br>
calculated by <br>
Step 12: if the available remaining power capacity payload is above the<br>
downlink traffic payload power increment, admit the call traffic, set the downlink<br>
traffic admission control permission as 'true' and then go to Step 14 for uplink<br>
admission control: otherwise, reject it. set the downlink traffic admission control<br>
permission as "false" and turn to Step 24 to wait for the next call;<br>
Step 13: extracting the uplink source rate ReP. the required SNR Eb/No, priority<br>
level and user ID for the traffic from the QoS parameters of the call traffic, and taking<br>
the minimum rate as the admission rate for non real-time traffic;<br>
Step 14: extracting the total uplink Rx (interference) power P10, (dBm) of the<br>
cell from the data groups reported by the base station, which is reported to RNC<br>
regularly by the base station equipment via signaling channel, and is the real-time<br>
uplink payload power of the cell:<br><br>
Step 15: calculating the equivalent throughput Ttotal (kbps) corresponding to the<br>
cell with the following equation, according to the traffic type and with reference to the<br>
total uplink Rx (interference) power Ptotal of the cell:<br><br>
where Ttotal (kbps) is the equivalent throughput, Tx is the maximum throughput<br>
power capacity payload for various traffic, Tx is 800kbps for 8kbps voice traffic and<br>
793kbps for 12.2kbps; and PN=-103dbM is background white noise.<br>
For data traffic, the equation is as following:<br><br>
Tx is 1280kbps for 64kbps, 144kbps for 144kbps, and 384kbps for 1536kbps.<br>
Equations (PT1) and (PT2) represent the rule of the power climb, and the power<br>
climb procedure is the non-linear increase procedure of the power.<br>
Step 16: adding the traffic source rate R (kbps) and the equivalent throughput<br>
Ttotal (kbps), to get the total throughput after traffic access;<br>
Step 17: substituting the total throughput into the above equation (PT1) or (PT2),<br>
to obtain the total power P total (dBm) of the cell after traffic access;<br>
Step 18: converting P total(dBm) and Ptotal (dBm) into absolute value, and<br>
then get the increase power of the traffic through subtraction:<br><br>
Step 19: subtracting the total Rx (interference) power measured and reported by<br>
the base station from the threshold of the maximum downlink transmission power of<br>
the cell, to get the uplink remaining power capacity payload of the cell, wherein the<br>
threshold is a maximum Rx power for guaranteeing stable system operation. That is:<br><br>
Step 20: reserving the power capacity payload required for soft switch,<br>
according to the requirement for soft switch, to avoid call drop and significant<br>
decrease in the system QoS when the user can't get enough power capacity payload<br>
during soft switch. Considering that the uplink power capacity payload reserved for<br><br><br>
soft switch is 50% and the uplink payload power (maximum payload power) for<br>
i<br>
guaranteeing stable system operation is 90%, the admission threshold for<br>
non-handover traffic call is 60% while that for handover traffic call is 90%, and the<br>
available remaining uplink power capacity payload of the cell can be further<br>
determined accordingly. That is: the available remaining power capacity payload for<br>
non-handover call traffic can be calculated with:<br><br>
the available remaining power capacity payload for handover call traffic can<br>
be calculated by:<br><br>
wherein 60% of the uplink payload power (uplink Rx total power) is equivalent<br>
to -93dBm, rising to -93dBm from -103dBm for empty carrying, while 90% of the<br>
payload power corresponds to -84dBm.<br>
If the available remaining uplink power capacity payload A Pm of the system<br>
cell (base station) is above the uplink payload power increment A P of the traffic, that<br>
is,   set the uplink admission permission as 'true', and go to Step 22;<br>
otherwise, go to Step 1 to process the next traffic call;<br>
Step 22: if both the uplink and downlink admission permissions are 'true',<br>
allocating downlink and uplink resource parameters for the call traffic; and allocating<br>
system resource parameters, and more particularly, the parameters for establishing<br>
radio link, such as spreading factor, transfer format, scrambling code and so on;<br>
Step 23: if the call traffic is admitted, the code resource table and the system<br>
payload power table need to be altered, so as to judge the next call admission control<br>
with the latest condition; if the call traffic is rejected, the code resource table and the<br>
system payload power table need no alteration; then wait for the next traffic call<br>
requesting for access, and iterate the above procedure from Step 1 when the call is<br>
received next time. When a traffic initiates the call or the call queue outputs, the call<br>
admission control procedure will be executed once<br>
As stated above, the present invention puts forward the following methods for<br>
the first time: 1. consider the power climb caused by multiple access interference in<br><br><br>
both uplink and downlink; 2. estimate the uplink and downlink payload power<br>
increment for the call traffic respectively, to be adapted to the access of asymmetric<br>
traffic; 3. employ estimation method for the path loss with equivalent mean radius on<br>
the downlink, and estimate the transmission power for the uplink traffic when no<br>
measurement information can be exploited; thus to estimate the payload power<br>
increment of the traffic; 4. perform admission control on uplink and downlink<br>
respectively; 5. admit non real-time traffic with minimum allowable transfer rate. This<br>
solves the problem of performing accurate admission control for asymmetric traffic,<br>
i.e. the contradiction between stable system; operation and call loss rate at higher<br>
payload power. This invention aims at the network design for CDMA systems and the<br>
admission control mechanism in network operation, and can estimate the downlink<br>
payload power increment of the call traffic accurately and facilitate admission control,<br>
thus improve the effect on increasing the network operation efficiency, and reducing<br>
call loss rate and call drop rate.<br>
Although the present invention has been shown and described with respect to<br>
exemplary embodiments thereof, it should be understood by those skilled in the art<br>
that various changes, omissions and additions may be therein and thereto, without<br>
departing from the spirit and the scope of the invention.<br><br>
