				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to caps and closures for carbonated and stiil drinks<br>
prepared with bimodal high density polyethylene resins.<br>
Polyethylene resins prepared with Ziegler-Natta (ZN) catalyst systems are generally<br>
used for preparing caps and closures for carbonated drinks. These resins have a<br>
reasonably high stress crack resistance, but they leave room for improvement. Such<br>
resins are for example Hostalen® GD4755 commercialised by Basell, or Eltex®<br>
B4020N commercialised by Inovene.<br>
Metallocene-prepared resins having a narrow monomodal polydispersity index have<br>
also been tested in that field but they do not offer ideal mechanical properties<br>
because of their limited stress crack resistance.<br>
There is thus a need to prepare resins that can be used to produce caps and<br>
closures for carbonated drinks.<br>
It is an aim of the present invention to produce caps and closures for carbonated<br>
drinks that have high environmental stress crack resistance.<br>
It is also an aim of the present invention to produce caps and closures for<br>
carbonated drinks with a resin that is easy to process by injection moulding or by<br>
compression moulding.<br>
it is another aim of the present invention to produce caps and closures for<br>
carbonated drinks that have a good rigidity.<br>
it is yet another aim of the present invention to provide caps and closures for<br>
carbonated drinks that have good tightness.<br><br>
It is a further aim of the present invention to prepare caps and closures for<br>
carbonated drinks that have a good dimensional stability.<br>
It is yet a further aim of the present invention to prepare caps and closures for<br>
carbonated drinks that have a good creep resistance.<br>
it is also an aim of the present invention to produce caps and closures for<br>
carbonated drinks that are easy to open.<br>
It is yet a further aim of the present invention to prepare caps and closures for<br>
carbonated drinks that have good organoleptical and food contact properties<br>
because they have a very little content of volatile organic compounds (VOC).<br>
Accordingly, the present invention discloses caps and closures for carbonated drinks<br>
produced by injection moulding or by compression moulding with a bimodal high<br>
density polyethylene (HDPE) resin.<br>
The bimodal HDPE resin can be prepared from a physical blend or from a chemical<br>
blend. The chemical blend can result for example from a single catalysts system<br>
used in a double loop reactor wherein the loops are operated under different<br>
polymerisation conditions or from two or more catalyst systems used in a single or in<br>
a double loop reactor.<br>
When a double loop reactor is used, it can be operated under various modes:<br>
-	hydrogen split wherein different concentrations of hydrogen are used in the<br>
different reactors in order to produce a low molecular weight fraction in a<br>
reactor and wherein the polydispersity is broadened in the other reactor;<br>
-	comonomer split wherein different comonomer concentrations are used in the<br>
different reactors in order to produce a low comonomer concentration in a<br>
reactor and a high comonomer concentration in the other reactor;<br>
-	comonomer/hydrogen split wherein a high molecular weight and high<br>
comonomer concentration is produced in one reactor and a low molecular<br><br>
weight, low comonomer concentratrion is produced in the second reactor. In<br>
the direct configuration, the high comonomer concentration is produced in the<br>
first reactor and vice versa, in the inverse configuration, the low comonomer<br>
concentration is produced in the first reactor.<br>
The first mode, in direct configuration, is preferred in the present invention.<br>
Preferably, the bimodal HDPE resin is prepared with a catalyst system based on a<br>
bridged bisindenyl catalyst component. The catalyst component is of general formula<br><br><br>
wherein (Ind) is an indenyhor an hydrogenated jndenyl, substituted or unsubstituted,<br>
R" is a structural bridge between the two indenyls to impart stereorigidity that<br>
comprises a C1-C4 alkylene radical, a dialkyl germanium or silicon or siloxane, or a<br>
alkyl phosphine or amine radical, which bridge is substituted or unsubstituted; Q is a<br>
hydrocarbyl radical having from 1 to 20 carbon atoms or a halogen, and M is a<br>
transition metal Group 4 of the Periodic Table or vanadium.<br>
Each indenyl or hydrogenated indenyl compound may be substituted in the same<br>
way or differently from one another at one or more positions in the cyclopentadienyl<br>
ring or in the cyclohexenyl ring and the bridge.<br>
Each substituent on the indenyl may be independently chosen from those of formula<br>
XRV in which X is chosen from Group 14 of the Periodic Table, oxygen and nitrogen<br>
and each R is the same or different and chosen from hydrogen or hydrocarbyl of<br>
from 1 to 20 carbon atoms and v+1 is the valence of X. X is preferably C. If the<br>
cyclopentadienyl ring is substituted, its substituent groups must not be so bulky as to<br>
affect coordination of the olefin monomer to the metal M. Substituents on the<br>
cyclopentadienyl ring preferably have R as hydrogen or CH3. More preferably, at<br>
least one and most preferably both cyclopentadienyl rings are unsubstituted.<br><br>
In a particularly preferred embodiment, both indenyls are unsubstituted, and most<br>
preferably they are unsubstituted hydrogenated indenyls. Most preferably it is<br>
isopropyledenebis(tetrahydroindenyl) zirconium dichloride.<br>
The active catalyst system used for polymerising ethylene comprises the above-<br>
described catalyst component and a suitable activating agent having an ionising<br>
action.<br>
Suitable activating agents are well known in the art: they include aluminium alkyls<br>
aluminoxane or boron-based compounds.<br>
Optionally, the catalyst component can be supported on a support.<br>
This catalyst system is preferably used in a liquid full double loop reactor wherein<br>
the loops are operated under different conditions in order to produce a bimodal<br>
resin. The double loop reactor can be operated either in direct configuration wherein<br>
the high comonomer concentration copolymer is prepared in the first reactor or in<br>
inverse configuration wherein the low comonomer concentration homopolymer is<br>
prepared in the first reactor.<br>
The bimodal resins of the present invention have densities of from 0.940 to 0.965<br><br>
g/cm3, preferably of from 0.945 to 0.955 g/cm3 and more preferably of about 0.950<br>
g/cm3. They have a melt index MI2 of from 1 to 50 dg/min, preferably of from 1 to 10<br>
dg/min, more preferably of from 1.5 to 8 dg/min, most preferably from 1.5 to 4<br>
dg/min. They have a polydispersity index that is preferably of at least 3, more<br>
preferably from 3.0 to 4.0 and most preferably from 3.1 to 3.6. The molecular<br>
weights are determined by GPC-DRI. In solution, long-branched polymers assume a<br>
more compact configuration than linear chains and their molecular weight can thus<br>
be slightly underestimated. Density is measured following the method of standard<br>
test ASTM 1505 at a temperature of 23 °C. Melt flow indices MI2 and HLMI are<br>
measured following the method of standard test ASTM D 1238 at a temperature of<br>
190 °C and respectively under loads of 2.16 and 21.6 kg. Poiydispersity index D is<br><br>
defined as the ratio Mw/Mn of the weight average molecular weight Mw over the<br>
number average molecular weight Mn and the molecular weights are determined by<br>
gel permeation chromatography (GPC).<br>
The caps and closures of the present invention are prepared by injection moulding<br>
or by compression moulding. The injection moulding cycle may be decomposed<br>
into three stages: filling, packing-holding, and cooling. During filling, polymer melt is<br>
forced into an empty cold cavity; once the cavity is filled, extra material is packed<br>
inside the cavity and held under high pressure in order to compensate for density<br>
increase during cooling. The cooling stage starts when the cavity gate is sealed by<br>
polymer solidification; further temperature decrease and polymer crystallisation<br>
takes place during the cooling stage. Typical temperatures for the filling step are of<br>
from 160 to 280 °C, preferably of from 230 to 260 °C. Compression moulding is<br>
carried out under similar conditions.<br>
Different approaches have been developed for evaluating resin processability in<br>
injection moulding processes.<br>
A first approach for testing flow in runners and in mould cavities during filling is to<br>
measure the viscosity at high shear rates and in isothermal conditions. Viscosity at<br>
high shear rates is the most important physical property that influences mould<br>
filling. The appropriate strain rates depend on the resin, the injection pressure and<br>
the mould geometry, but typical strain rates are above 1500 - 2500 s-1. It is also<br>
important to take into account the viscosity differences caused by the temperature<br>
differences inside the mould, wherein the central temperature is higher than the<br>
peripheral temperature.<br>
A second approach involves non-isothermal tests that simulate the injection<br>
moulding process. In these tests, the rheologjcal, crystellisation and thermal<br>
properties of polymers are taken into account. The test however does not yield<br>
values of physical properties but gives a purely empirical, apparatus-dependent<br>
measure of processability. It is the spiral flow test that consists in measuring the<br><br>
spiral flow length before freeze-up of melted polymer injected into a standard<br>
mould under standard filling conditions.<br>
The caps and closures according to the present invention are characterised by a<br>
remarkably low content of volatile organic compounds.<br><br>
Figure 1 represents the molecular weight distribution of the resins tested.<br>
Figure 2 represents the complex viscosity expressed in Pas as a function of<br>
frequency expressed in rad/s for several resins.<br>
Figure 3 represents the flow length FL expressed in mm as a function of injection<br>
pressure expressed in bars.<br>
Examples.<br>
Several resins have been tested in the production of caps and closures for<br>
carbonated drinks.<br>
They were selected as follows.<br>
Resin R1 is a monomodal high density polyethylene (HDPE) resin prepared with<br>
isopropylidene-bis(tetrahydroindenyl) zirconium dichloride.<br>
Resins R3 to R5 are bimodal HDPE resins prepared with isopropylidene-<br>
bis(tetrahydroindenyl) zirconium dichloride (THI) in a double loop reactor in inverse<br>
configuration, i.e. wherein the homopolymer is prepared in the first reactor.<br><br>
Resin R2, R6 and R9 are bimodal HDPE resins prepared with isopropylidene-<br>
bis(tetrahydroindenyl) zirconium dichloride (THI) in a double loop reactor in direct<br>
configuration, i.e. wherein the copolymer is prepared in the first reactor.<br>
Resins R7 and R8 are conventional, commercially available, Ziegler-Natta HDPE<br>
resins.<br>
Their properties are summarised in Table I.<br><br>
The curves representing the molecular weight distribution for all resins are<br>
represented in Figure 1. As expected, the molecular weight distribution of all the<br>
resins prepared with a Ziegler-Natta catalyst system are significantly broader than<br>
those of all the metallocene-prepared resins. In addition, they include very long<br>
chains that are characterised by a high molecular weight fraction above 106 daltons<br>
at variance with all the metallocene-prepared resins, both monomodal and bimodal<br>
that do not contain very long chains.<br><br>
The molecular architecture of the resins has also been investigated and the amount<br>
of short chain branching and long chain branching has been evaluated for each<br>
resin. All samples were very crystalline.<br>
The short chain branching content was measured by NMR. The results for all resins<br>
are displayed in Table II as well as the nature of the short branches.<br>
The long chain branching content was determined by the long chain branching index<br>
(LCBI) method. The method is described by Schroff R.N. and Mavridis H. in<br>
Macromolecules, 32, 8454 (1999) and LCBI is given by empirical formula<br><br>
wherein no is the zero shear viscosity expressed in Pa.s and [n] is the intrinsic<br>
viscosity in solution expressed in g/mol. This method is more sensitive than the usual<br>
Dow Rheological Index (DRI) or NMR methods and is independent of the<br>
polydispersity. It was developed for substantially linear polyethylene such as typically<br>
obtained in metallocene catalysis and it only requires the measurement of intrinsic<br>
viscosity of a dilute polymer solution and the zero shear viscosity. It is equal to zero<br>
for linear chains and deviates from zero when long chain branching is present. The<br>
intrinsic viscosity values were calculated from the Mark-Houwink relationship that<br>
was developed for linear chains and it must be noted that this method only applies to<br>
resins having a small content of long chain branching. The zero shear viscosity was<br>
obtained by Carreau-Yasada fitting. The results are displayed in Table II and they<br>
show that the resins prepared with Ziegler-Natta catalyst systems have no long chain<br>
branching and that the bimodal metallocene-prepared resins have the highest level<br>
of long chain branching.<br><br><br><br>
The complex viscosity curves as a function of angular frequency are presented in<br>
Figure 2. Plate-plate rheometer data were used because they are more precise and<br>
more reliable. It is known in the art that shear thinning or pseudo-plastic behaviour is<br>
influenced by the presence of long chain branching or by broadening of the<br>
molecular weight distribution. As can be seen from figure 2, the bimodal resins<br>
prepared with THI have the most pronounced pseudo-plastic behaviour due to the<br>
combined effects of the presence of long chain branching and fairly broad molecular<br>
weight distribution.<br>
The temperature dependence of the viscosity can be described by formula<br><br>
wherein aT is the time shift factor, T is the temperature and p and p0 are the densities<br>
respectively at temperatures T and T0. Far from the glass transition temperature, as<br>
is the case for the polyethylene of the present invention, the flow activation energy<br>
Ea can be derived from the Arrhenius relationship:<br><br>
The calculated values are reported in Table III. It was observed that the activation<br>
energy of all resins prepared with THI had much higher values of the activation<br><br>
energy than those obtained for the resins prepared with Ziegler-Natta catalyst<br>
systems: this is due to the presence of long chain branching.<br><br>
A standard mouldability test has been carried out. Melted polymer was injected into a<br>
standard mould having a simple spiral geometry involving a long flow path. The<br>
moudability index is defined as the flow length, meaning the length of mould filled<br>
before freeze-up under standard filling conditions. The injection pressure and<br>
temperature have been varied. Flow lengths (FL) for several resins have been<br>
reported as a function of increasing injection pressure at a temperature of 210 °C in<br>
Figure 3. For resin R6, the spiral flow lengths (SFL) have been measured at a<br>
temperature of 210 °C and respectively under injection pressures of 500, 800 and<br>
1000 bars: they were respectively of 131,182 and 231 mm. Bimodal resins present<br>
high FL values, in agreement with viscosity results. Bimodal THI resins have a low<br>
viscosity at high shear rate as a result of their pronounced shear thinning behaviour.<br>
Several injection trials were carried out to prepare caps and closures with these<br>
resins. The injection machine had the following characteristics:<br><br>
-	Engel ES250 6340 device, equipped with a barrier screw having a diameter D<br>
of 55 mm and a ratio length over diameter L/D of 24;<br>
-	maximum hydrauloc pressure of 172 bars;<br>
-	mould having 48 cavities;<br>
-	caps and closures having a diameter of 28 mm and a weight of 2.8 g<br>
The experimental injection conditions were as follows:<br>
-	cycle time of about 6 s;<br>
-	residence time of the material into the screw of about 2 shots, a shot being<br>
the average time between two cycles;<br>
-	screw rotation speed of 400 rpm;<br>
-	temperature profile: 25/240/245/250/255/260 °C;<br>
-	holding pressure of 60 bars;<br>
-	clamping force of 2400 N<br>
The results are summarised in Table IV<br><br><br>
wherein Pinj is the maximum injection pressure expressed in bars, dem-com are the<br>
demoulding comments and dem-index is the demoulding index ranking from i for<br>
easy demoulding to 5 for difficult demoulding. Easy de-moulding of the caps<br>
prepared according to the present invention is the result of the excellent dimensional<br>
stability of metallocene prepared resins.<br>
In conclusion, the processability of all bimodal mPE was comparable to that of the<br>
prior art commercial ZNPE grades. The maximum injection was slightly higher for the<br>
bimodal mPE than for the reference conventional ZNPE, but the cycle time was<br>
similar to that of prior art resins and demoulding was easy. The maximum injection<br>
pressure was in line with viscosity and spiral flow observations.<br>
The characterisation of solid state properties were carried out as follows on two<br>
types of specimens:<br>
A)	compression-moulded specimens for the evaluation of rigidity by the flexion<br>
test following the method of standard test ISO 178.<br>
B)	injected caps for the evaluation of:<br><br>
a)	stress crack resistance by specific pressure tests;<br>
b)	dimensional stability with a micrometer;<br>
c)	tightness by a high pressure test<br>
All caps were prepared in the same injection conditions and on the same<br>
machine in order to minimise thermo-mechanical and cap design effects.<br>
Pressure inside carbonated drink bottles can cause excessive deformation of<br>
caps and closures. Rigidity is thus a crucial parameter in order to avoid such<br>
deformation. The flexural modulus was measured following the method af<br>
standard test ISO 178. The results are displayed in Table V. The values of the<br>
flexural modulus are very similar for all resins.<br>
Stress cracking in caps and closure occurs in two possible ways: either pressure<br>
crack at the top of the cap or capping torque crack at the contouring of the cap.<br><br>
Pressure tests were carried out using a method developed in-house. It consists in<br>
applying a pressure on a cap screwed on a pre-form/bottle.<br>
Five caps were screwed respectively on five bottles at a torque of 1.8 N.m The<br>
cap/bottle systems were placed under a constant air relative pressure of 6 bars at<br>
a temperature of 45 °C. During the test, the pressure was continuously measured<br>
and the appearance of macro-cracks was visually checked once a day. The test<br>
was stopped when pressure inside the bottles had decreased to atmospheric<br>
pressure because of the presence of cracks.<br>
The results are presented in Table V. They show that the superiority of bimodal mPE<br>
resins over prior art reference resin R7.<br>
It is known in the art that increasing the molecular weight and short-chain branching<br>
(SCB) improves stress crack resistance because there are more tie molecules and<br>
more effective tie molecule entanglement and anchoring in the crystalline lamellae.<br>
Incorporation of comonomer is also known to increase the content of tie molecules<br>
and the efficiency of entanglements. The metallocene-prepared polyethylene resins<br>
of the present invention are characterised by long chains, high level of SCB and<br>
optimised distribution of SCB along the long chains. As a consequence, they have<br>
improved stress crack resistance.<br>
The height and lips of caps were measured about 24 hours hours after injection with<br>
a micrometre. They were all within specifications but the mPE resins presented<br>
slightly lower shrinkage than the other resins.<br>
All the caps prepared according to the present invention were also tested for<br>
tightness: they were submitted to a pressure of 10 bars during one minute. They all<br>
passed the test.<br>
TABLE V<br><br><br>
In this table, Efl lis the flexural modulus expressed in Mpa, F50a is the average failure<br>
time expressed in days as determined by the in-house method.<br>
In addition opening torque results and taste results have shown equivalent behaviour<br>
for all the resins tested.<br>
The volatile organic compounds (VOC) have much smaller concentrations for<br>
metallocene-prepared resins than for the Ziegler-Natta resins. Polymer samples<br>
were analysed by Automated Thermal Desorption (ATD)/Gas chromatography (GC)<br>
method with quantitative analysis by Flame Induction Decay (FID) method. This<br>
technique consisted in a thermic desorption, at a temperature of 150 °C, of the<br>
volatile organic compounds contained in the polymer. The organic compounds were<br>
carried along by a stream of helium and were trapped by adsorbent TENAX® cooled<br>
down to a temperature of -40 °C. The volatile compounds were then injected in a<br>
chromatographic separation column by heating the trap to a temperature of 240 °C.<br>
Quantification was carried out using an external calibration line and identification was<br>
carried out on the basis of retention time. The VOC results from Table V show that<br>
Ziegler-Natta grades have a much higher concentration of volatile organic<br>
compounds than all metallocene-prepared resins according to the present invention.<br><br>
As a consequence of their low content of volatiles, the organoleptic properties (taste<br>
and odour) of the resins according to the present invention were excellent. They<br>
were measured by the procedure described as follows. 25 g of pellets were<br>
contacted with 1 L of water at a temperature of 60 °C for 48 hr, followed by 48 hr of<br>
the same water at a temperature of 20 °C. Several dilutions of that water were then<br>
tested by a panel of 8 tasters according to the following dilution scheme.<br>
% test water Stage<br>
50	A2<br>
33	A3<br>
20	A5<br>
14.3	A7<br>
The test is negative and the sample water is declared not conform if a taste or odour<br>
is perceived at stages A5 or A7.<br>
The use of bimodal metallocene-prepared polyethylene resins is thus a very<br>
attractive alternative to reference Ziegler-Natta resins. They offer improved stress<br>
crack resistance and VOC with respect to reference resins whereas they keep the<br>
same level of processability, rigidity, opening torque and taste as prior art resins.<br>
The bimodal HDPE of the present invention can be used in various applications such<br>
as for example,<br>
-	in injection or compression moulding for caps closure used for beverage,<br>
cosmetics or food;<br>
-	in blow moulding for milk bottles;<br>
-	in extrusion for raffia;<br>
-	in cable jacketing.<br><br>

ABSTRACT<br><br>
A PROCESS FOR PREPARING CAPS AND<br>
CLOSURES FOR CARBONATED DRINKS<br>
A process for preparing caps and closures for carbonated drinks is disclosed. The<br>
process for preparing caps and closures for carbonated drinks with a bimodal high density<br>
polyethylene (HDPE) resin produced with a catalyst system comprises a bisindenyl-based<br>
catalyst component and wherein said HDPE resin has a density, measured following the<br>
method of standard test ASTM 1505 at a temperature of 23°C, of from 0.945 to 0.965<br>
g/cm3, a melt index MI2, measured following the method of standard test ASTM D 1238 at<br>
a temperature of 190°C and under a load of 2.16 kg, of from 1 to 10 dg/min, and a<br>
molecular weight distribution, defined by the polydispersity index D that is the ratio<br>
Mw/Mn of the weight average molecular weight Mw over the number average molecular<br>
weight Mn, of at least 3.</td>
