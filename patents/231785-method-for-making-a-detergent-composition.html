				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a method for making a detergent composition comprising detergent particles. The present invention also relates to a particulate detergent composition and to an improved process for making such compositions. The detergent compositions of the Invention are suitable for any cleaning process, such as laundry and dishwashing detergent compositions. Such particulate compositions may be used directly in their particulate form or may first be formed into detergent tablets by any standard tabletting process such as compaction.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
In order to meet the needs of the consumer, in addition to providing good cleaning, detergent compositions must meet many additional requirements including good aesthetics, good flow properties, good solubility and good dispensing performance into wash water. In order to meet all of these requirements, the complexity of detergent compositions and range of products offered has grown. Formulation flexibility for producing such complex compositions is therefore extremely important and many methods for formulating detergent compositions are already known.<br>
In view of the high performance requirements of the consumer, achieving uniform dosage of all of the detergent actives in the composition has increased importance, in particular where sophisticated detergent ingredients present in detergents at low levels make a significant impact on one of the performance features mentioned above. This problem is exacerbated by the advent of "compact" or low dosage granular detergent products. These low dosage detergents are currently in high demand as they conserve resources and can be sold is small packages which are more convenient for consumers prior to use. However, in a low dosage of detergent, where actives are present in very low levels, significant variability may occur in the concentration of such actives in each unit dosage. Performance problems have been identified with some compact detergent products and the present inventors have now found that this may be due to formulation variability where low level detergent ingredients which give a significant impact on one or more of the performance factors mentioned above may vary considerably from dose to dose.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
The present invention therefore reduces these problems by providing a process in which such low dosage/high impact ingredients can be dispersed uniformly throughout a detergent formulation. Segregation is minimised without the need to incorporate high levels of fillers to form such low dosage/high impact ingredients into larger particles.<br>
In accordance with the present invention there is now provided a method for making a detergent particles comprising selecting detergent base particles having a geometric mean particle diameter from 500 - 2000 microns, in a moderate to low shear mixer adhering detergent active particulates to the detergent base particles, wherein the detergent active particulates have a geometric mean particle diameter no greater than 40% of the geometric mean particle diameter of the detergent base particles and comprise a detergent active selected from perfumes, enzymes, photobleaches, catalysts, soil release polymers, suds suppressors, bleaching compounds, whitening agents and layered silicates.<br>
The present invention also provides detergent particles produced by such a process, and detergent compositions incorporating these particles.<br>
As used herein, it is intended to mean that a detergent active particulate is bound to the detergent base particulate, the two components subsequently appearing in a detergent composition as an individual detergent particle.<br>
Detailed Description of the Invention Physical Properties<br>
The detergent active particulates preferably have a geometric mean particle diameter which is below 200fim, preferably below I5Oµm and even below 100µm. The geometric mean particle diameter of the detergent active particulates is generally above1oµm preferably above 20 µm and may even be above 40µm or above 60um.<br>
As used herein, the phrase "geometric mean particle diameter" means the geometric mass median diameter of a set of discrete particles as measured by any standard mass-based particle size measurement technique, preferably by dry sieving. A suitable sieving method is in accordance with I5O 3118 (1976). A suitable device is the Ro-Tap testing sieve shaker Model B using 8 inch sieves of selected sizes. As used herein, the phrase "geometric standard deviation" or "span" of a particle size distribution means the geometric breadth of the best-fitted log-normal function to the above-mentioned particle size data which can be accomplished by the ratio of the diameter of the 84.13 percentile divided by the diameter of the 50th percentilc of the cumulative distribution (DB4 .13/D5o); See Gotoh et al, Powder Technology Handbook, pp. 6-11, Marcel Dekker 1997.<br>
The detergent base particles have a geometric mean particle diameter from 500 to 2000µm. The geometric mean particle diameter of the detergent base particles is generally greater than 550µm or even greater than 600µm or 650µm. Preferably, the geometric mean particle diameter of the detergent base particles is below I5OOµm.<br><br>
The detergent particles produced preferably have a geometric standard deviation of from 1 to about 2, preferably from 1.0 to 1.7. more preferably from about 1.0 to about 1.4. Preferred fully formulated detergents comprising the detergent particles also have such a geometric standard deviation.<br>
Preferably the geometric mean particle diameter of the detergent active particulates is no greater than 20% of the geometric mean panicle diameter of the detergent base particles more preferably no greater than 10% and may even be below 5% of the geometric mean particle diameter of the detergent base particles.   Generally in the detergent particles, no more than 25wt% is derived from the detergent active particulates, preferably no greater than 10 wt%. The invention may even be useful where the proportion of the detergent particles derived from the detergent active particulates is no greater than 5 or even no greater than 2 wt%.<br>
As used herein the term "bulk density" refers to the uncompressed, untapped powder bulk density, as measured by pouring an excess of particulate sample through a funnel into a smooth metal vessel (e.g. a 500ml volume cylinder) scraping off the excess off the heap above the rim of the vessel, measuring the remaining mass of powder and dividing the mass by the volume of the vessel.<br>
The bulk density of the detergent particles produced and also of the detergent base particles is generally above 200 g/1 and may be as high as 1500 g/1. It is particularly preferred that the bulk density a finished detergent composition comprising the detergent particles produced according to the present invention is greater than 550 g/1, preferably greater than 600 g/1 or even above 650 g/1. The bulk density of the detergent particles produced is therefore generally from 400g/l to 1100 g/1, generally above 500g/l or even above 550 or 650g/l, generally less than 1000g/l or below 900g/l. The invention may be particularly useful for forming detergent particles having a low bulk density such as below 550 or even below 500 or 450 g/1.<br>
The detergent base particles for use in the method of the present invention may comprise a single detergent ingredient in particulate form or may be a pre-mix of detergent ingredients. Where the detergent base particles comprise a pre-mix. the separate detergent ingredients may simply be mixed together or may comprise a pre-formed particulate comprising any combination of two or more detergent ingredients, or mixtures thereof, optionally with single detergent ingredients. Suitable pre-formed particulates for the base particles may have been formed by spray-drying, agglomeration, marumerisation, extrusion or compaction, all of which methods for combining detergent ingredients are well-known in the art. Particularly preferred pre-formed particulates are powders obtained from spray-drying processes, agglomerates and extrudates. Spray-dried powders arc particularly useful. Pre-formed particulates made according to at least<br>
one low shear mixing step, for example in a fluidised bed. for example by fluid bed agglomeration are particularly preferred. Particularly preferred particles are as described in our co-pending application filed today under reference number CM2158F.<br>
Suitable spray-drying processes for forming such pre-formed particulates are described for example in EP-A-763594 or EP-A-437888. Suitable processes for forming pre-formed particulates which are agglomerates are described for example in WO93/25378, EP-A-367339, EP-A-420317 or EP-A-506184 and suitable processes for forming pre-formed particulates by extrusion are described for example in W091/02047.<br>
Such pre-formed particulates may be added to the mixer in their wet or dry state. They are preferably added to the mixer in their dry state as addition in their wet state may have an adverse effect on flow into the mixer. Alternatively it may be preferred that the pre-formed particulates are formed in a first stage of a moderate to low shear mixer and the detergent active particulates are added in a second stage so that the pre-formed particulates may be in a wet state when they are contacted with the detergent active particulates. Thus, the pre-formed particulate may be for example an agglomerate, blown powder or extrudate which has not yet undergone a final drying stage.<br>
Generally this means that a solvent used as a binding agent for the processing is present in higher amounts than are desirably present in a finished particulate detergent. Generally the solvent is water and wet particulates will have a free water content for example of from l5 to 30 wt % of the pre-formed particulate. Often, however, the pre-formed particulate will already have undergone a drying step prior to addition to the mixer so that the water content will be below 15 wt %, preferably below 10 wt %. Generally the free water content of the detergent base particles on entry into the mixer will be below 15 wt %, preferably below 10 wt %.<br>
It may be preferred that the detergent base particles comprise a surfactant or mixture of surfactants. Suitable surfactants are described below. The surfactant content of the detergent base particles or a pre-formed particulate component forming all or part of the detergent base particles is preferably from 5 to 80 % by weight of the particulate component. Amounts of surfactants above 10 or even above 30% may be preferred. Amounts of surfactant below 70% or even below 50% may be preferred. Where the detergent base pre-formed particulate component comprises surfactant, generally it will in addition comprise a builder or alkalinity agent such as sodium carbonate, zeolite, or phosphate. For example, each of these components individually, or in mixtures may be present in amounts above 5%, preferably above 10% or even above 20% by weight of the content of the pre-formed particulate component. Particularly preferred builder components are sodium carbonate and/or zeolite. Zeolite A and zeolite MAP are both suitable.<br>
The detergent base particles preferably also comprises an organic builder such as a poly carboxyhc acid and-or salt such as citric acid, tartaric acid, malic acid, succinic acid and their salts or a polymeric polycarboxylate such as polymers based on acrylic acids or maleic acids or co-polymers thereof. Such components are generally present in the panicle at levels below 15 wt % of the particulate component, preferably below 10 wt % of the particulate component.<br>
Other preferred ingredients in the pre-formed particulate component are chelants such as phosphonate chelants NTA, DTPA and succinic acid derivative chelants, as described below. These components are preferably present in the detergent base particles in amounts below 5 wt % or even below 2 wt %. Suds supressors and/or soil release polymers and/or bleach activators are also preferred ingredients in pre-formed particulates.<br>
Where the particulate components are detergent raw materials, any particulate detergent ingredient is suitable. These may be solid surfactants or soaps, or water soluble or dispersable polymeric materials, enzymes, bleaching components such as bleach activators or bleach salts such as peroxy salts. Highly suitable single ingredients in particulate form include inorganic components, particularly water-soluble inorganic: components such as builders and bleach salts such as alkali metal percarbonates and/or perborates. These ingredients are discussed in more detail below.<br>
Suitable detergent ingredients for incorporation either into the detergent particles themselves, or for post-addition to formulate a fully formulated detergent composition are discussed below.<br>
The detergent active particulates are selected from perfumes, enzymes, photobleaches, catalysts, soil release polymers, suds suppressors, bleaching compounds, whitening agents and layered silicates.<br>
Perfumes<br>
Preferred detergent active particulates comprise perfume. Any perfume or perfume composition can be used. However, it must be solid or in combination with other components so that it has a solid form. For example it may be loaded onto a particulate carrier such as zeolite, or any other known solid carrier, for example as described in WO94/16046, ES93000006, EP-A-535942, and EP-A-294206. More preferably it is present in encapsulated form. Suitable encapsulates are described for example in WO94/12613, EP-A-539025, EP-A-478326, EP-A-'383406, EP-A-382464, EP-A-346034, EP-A-70719. Particularly preferred encapsulates comprise starch.<br>
Preferred perfumes contain at least one component with a low molecular weight volatile component, e.g. having a molecular weight of from 150 to 450 or preferably 350. Preferably, the<br>
perfume component comprises an oxygen-containing functional group. Preferred functional groups are aldehyde, ketone, alcohol or ether functional groups or mixtures thereof.<br>
Enzymes<br>
The detergent active particulates may comprise one or more enzymes. Suitable enzymes include the commercially available lipases, cutinases, amylases, neutral and alkaline proteases, cellulases, endolases, esterases, pectinases, lactases and peroxidases conventionally incorporated into detergent compositions. Suitable enzymes are discussed in US Patents 3,519,570 and 3,533,139.<br>
Preferred commercially available protease enzymes include those sold under the tradcnames Alcalase, Savinase, Primase, Durazym, and Esperasc by Novo Industries A/S (Denmark), those sold under the tradename Maxatase, Maxacal and Maxapem by Gist-Brocades, those sold by Genencor International, and those sold under the tradename Opticlean and Optimase by Solvay Enzymes. Protease enzyme may be incorporated into the compositions in accordance with the invention at a level of from 0.0001% to 4% active enzyme by weight of the composition.<br>
Preferred amylases include, for example, of-amylases, described in more detail in GB-1,269,839 (Novo). Preferred commercially available amylases include for example, those sold under the tradename Rapidase by Gist-Brocades, and those sold under the tradename Termamyl, Duramyl and BAN by Novo Industries A/S. Preferred amylase enzymes may be those described in PCT/ US 9703635, and in WO95/26397 and WO96/23873. Amylase enzyme may be incorporated into the composition in accordance with the invention at a level of from 0.0001% to 2% active enzyme by weight.<br>
Lipolytic enzyme may be present at levels of active lipolytic enzyme of from 0.0001% to 2% by weight, preferably 0.001% to 1% by weight, most preferably from 0.001% to 0.5% by weight based on the content in the final detergent composition. The lipase may be fungal or bacterial in origin being obtained, for example, from a lipase producing strain ofHumicola sp., Thermomvces sp. or Pseudomonas sp. including Pseudomonas pseudoalcaligenes or Pseudomas fluorescens. Lipase from chemically or genetically modified mutants of these strains are also useful herein. A preferred lipase is derived from Pseudomonas pseudoalcali genes, which is described in EP-B-0218272. Another preferred lipase is obtained by cloning the gene from Humicola lanueinosa and expressing the gene in Aspereillus orvza. as host, as described in European Patent Application, EP-A-0258 068, which is commercially available from Novo Industri A/S, Bagsvaerd, Denmark, under the trade name Lipolase. This lipase is also described in U.S. Patent 4,810,414, Huge-Jensen et al, issued March 7, 1989.<br>
Photobleaches<br>
Preferred detergent active particulates comprise photobleach panicles. Preferred photo-bleaches herein comprise a compounds having a porphin or porphyrin structure. Porphin and porphyrin, in the literature, are used as synonyms, but conventionally porphin stands for the simplest porphyrin without any substituents; wherein porphynn is a sub-class of porphin. The references to porphin in this application will include porphyrin. The porphin structures preferably comprise a metal element or cation, preferably Ca, Mg, P, Ti. Cr, Zr, In. Sn or Hf, more preferably Ge, Si or Ga. or more preferably Al, most preferably Zn. It can be preferred that the photo-bleach or component is substituted with substituents selected from alkyl groups such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, t-butyl group and aromatic ring systems such as pyridyl, pyridyl-N-oxidc, phcnyl, naphthyl and anthracyl moieties.<br>
The photo-bleaching compound or component can have solubilizing groups as substituents. Alternatively, or in addition hereto the photo-bleaching agent can comprise a polymeric component capable of solubilizing the photo-bleaching compound, for example PVP, PVNP, PVI or co-polymers thereof or mixtures thereof.<br>
Highly preferred photo-bleaching compounds have a phthalocyanine structure, which preferably have the metal elements or cations described above. The phthalocyanines can be substituted, suitable examples include the phthalocyanine structures which are substituted at one or more of the 1-4, 6, 8-11, 13, 15-18, 20, 22-25, 27 atom positions.<br>
One preferred group of photoblcaches comprise a polymeric component and a photobleaching component integrated with one another, whereby the weight ratio of polymeric component to photobleaching component is from 1:1 to 1000:1, preferably 20:1 to 100:1. Particularly preferred polymeric compounds are formed from monomeric units selected from N-vinylpyrolidone, N-vinylacetamide, N-vinyl imidazole, N-vinyl oxazolidone, N-vinylrriazole, 4-vinylpyridine and 4-vinylpyrilidine-N-oxide. Preferred photo-bleaching compounds are metals, preferably zinc, phthalocyamines or aluminium. Such photo-bleaches arc described in GB 2329397A.<br>
Soil Release Polymers<br>
Preferred soil release polymers (SRPs) typically have hydrophihc segments to hydrophihze the surface of hydrophobic fibers such as polyester and nylon, and hydrophobic segments to deposit upon hydrophobic fibers and remain adhered thereto through completion of washing and rinsing cycles, thereby serving as an anchor for the hydrophilic segments. This can enable stains occurring subsequent to treatment with the SRP to be more easily cleaned in later washing procedures. Preferred SRPs include oligomenc tcrcphthalatc esters, typically prepared by<br>
processes involving at least one transesterification/oligomerization. often with a metal catalyst such as a maniuni(IV) alkoxide. Such esters may be made using additional monomers capable of being incorporated into the ester structure through one two, three, four or more positions, without, of course, forming a densely crosslinked overall structure.<br>
Suitable SRPs include a sulfonated product of a substantially linear ester oligomer comprised of an oligomeric ester backbone of terephthaloyl and oxyalkyleneoxy repeat units and allyl-derived sulfonated terminal moieties covalently attached to the backbone, for example as described in U.S. 4,968,451, November 6, 1990 to J.J. Scheibel and E.P. Gosselink. Such ester oligomers can be prepared by: (a) ethoxylating allyl alcohol; (b) reacting the product of (a) with dimethyl terephthalate ("DMT") and 1,2-propylene glycol ("PG") in a two-stage transesterification/oligomerization procedure; and (c) reacting the product of (b) with sodium metabisulfite in water. Other SRPs include the nonionic end-capped 1,2-propylenc/polyoxyethylene terephthalate polyesters of U.S. 4,711,730, December 8, 1987 to Gosselink et al., for example those produced by transesterification/oligomerization of poly-(ethyleneglycol) methyl ether, DMT, PG and poly(ethyleneglycol) ("PEG"). Other examples of SRA's include: the partly- and fully- anionic-end-capped oligomeric esters of U.S. 4,721,580, January 26, 1988 to Gosselink, such as oligomers from ethylene glycol ("EG"), PG, DMT and Na-3,6-dioxa-8-hydroxyoctanesulfonate; the nonionic-capped block polyester oligomeric compounds of U.S. 4,702,857, October 27, 1987 to Gosselink, for example produced from DMT, methyl (Me)-capped PEG and EG and/or PG. or a combination of DMT, EG and/or PG, Mc-capped PEG and Na-dimethyl-5-sulfoisophthalatc; and the anionic, especially sulfoaroyl, end-capped terephthalate esters of U.S. 4,877,896, October 31, 1989 to Maldonado, Gosselink et al., the latter being typical of SRPs useful in both laundry and fabric conditioning products, an example being an ester composition made from m-sulfobenzoic acid monosodium salt, PG and DMT, optionally but preferably further comprising added PEG, e.g., PEG 3400. SRPs also include: simple copolymeric blocks of ethylene terephthalate or propylene terephthalate with polyethylene oxide or polypropylene oxide terephthalate, see U.S. 3,959,230 to Hays, May 25, 1976 and U.S. 3.893,929 to Basadur, July 8, 1975; cellulosic derivatives such as the hydroxyethcr cellulosic polymers available as METHOCEL from Dow; the Cj-C4 alky! celluloses and €4<br>
hydroxyalkyl celluloses, see U.S. 4,000,093, December 28, 1976 to Nicol, et al.; and the methyl cellulose ethers having an average degree of substitution (methyl) per anhydroglucose unit from about 1.6 to about 2.3 and a solution viscosity of from about 80 to about 120 centipoise measured at 20°C as a 2% aqueous solution. Such materials are available as METOLOSE SMI00™ and<br><br>
METOLOSE SM200™, which are methyl cellulose ethers manufactured by Shin-etsu Kagaku Kogyo KK.<br>
Additional classes of SRPs include those described in U.S. 4,201,824, Violland et al. and U.S. 4.240,918 Lagasse et al.: and SRA's with carboxylate terminal groups made by adding trimellitic anhydride to known SRP's to convert terminal hydroxyl groups to trimellitate esters. With the proper selection of catalyst, the trimellitic anhydride forms linkages to the terminals of the polymer through an ester of the isolated carboxylic acid of trimellitic anhydride rather than by opening of the anhydride linkage. Either nonionic or anionic SRPs may be used as starting materials as long as they have hydroxyl terminal groups which may be esterified. See U.S. 4,525,524 Tung et al., and U.S. 4,201,824, Violland etal.<br>
Suitable soil release polymers may be selected from: (a) alkyl and hydroxyalkyl ethers of cellulose containing from one to four carbon atoms in the alkyl moiety and having a molar degree of substitution of from 1.5 to 2.7 and a number average molecular weight of from 2000 to 100000; (b) polymers comprising ethylene terephthalate and polyethylene oxide terephthalate at a mole ratio of from 1:10; (c) polymers comprising propylene terephthalate and polyethylene oxide terephthalate at a mole ratio of from 1:10 to 10:1, said polyethylene oxide terephthalate containing polyethylene oxide units with a number average molecular weight of from 500 to 10000 and said soil release agent having a number average molecular weight of from 1000 to 100000; and (d) polymers comprising ethylene terephthalate and/or propylene terephthalate in any ratio and polyethylene oxide and/or polypropylene oxide many ratio such that the mole ratio of ethylene terephthalate plus propylene terephthalate to polyethylene oxide plus polypropylene oxide is from 1:10 to 10:1, said polyethylene oxide units and said polypropylene oxide units each having a number average molecular weight of from 250 ti 10000 and said soil release agent having a number average molecular weight of from 1000 to 100000; and mixtures thereof; as described in more detail in EP-A-271312.<br>
Suds Supressors<br>
The detergent active particulates may comprise suds supressors. Suitable suds suppressing systems may comprise essentially any known antifoam compound, including, for example silicone antifoam compounds and 2-alkyl alcanol antifoam compounds or soap.<br>
By antifoam compound it is meant herein any compound or mixtures of compounds which act such as to depress the foaming or sudsing produced by a solution of a detergent composition, particularly in the presence of agitation of that solution.<br>
Particularly preferred antifoam compounds for use herein are silicone antifoam compounds defined herein as any antifoam compound including a silicone component. Such<br>
silicone antifoarn compounds also typically contain a silica component. The term "silicone" as used herein, and in general throughout the industry, encompasses a variety of relatively high molecular weight polymers containing siloxane units and hydrocarbyl group of various types.

The preferred detergent active particulates comprise perfume, photobleach and/or catalyst. Perfume and/or photobleaches are particularly preferred. In a particularly preferred aspect of the invention, the detergent active particulates comprise encapsulated perfume. In a further particularly preferred aspect of the invention, the detergent active particulates comprise photobleach.<br>
The preferred proportion of detergent active particulates to detergent base powder will vary dependent upon the relative particle sizes of these two components. Preferably in the final detergent composition the weight percentage of any one of the detergent active particulates will be no greater than 10wt%, preferably below 5 wt% or even below 2 or 1 wt% of the detergent base particles. In particular where the proportion of detergent active particulates is as low as 5 or 2 or 1 wt% of the detergent base powder, preferably the geometric mean particle size of the detergent active particulates is no greater than 20%, preferably no greater than 10 % or even below 5 or even 2 or 1% of the geometric mean particle size of the detergent base particles.<br>
The detergent particles themselves may contain all of the ingredients of a full formulated detergent or may be mixed with additional detergent components such as individual detergent ingredients in particulate form or pre-formed detergent particles as described above which may form part of the detergent base particles. The individual detergent ingredients in particulate form may be any of the detergent ingredients described below, in a particulate form. Preferably, detergent compositions of the present invention comprise more than 30 wt%. more preferably more than 50 wt% or even as high as 80 or 90 wt% or even 95 wt% of the detergent panicles according to the present invention. The higher the level of detergent particles of the present invention, the greater the benefits of the invention in terms of promoting uniform dosages of detergent from a package of particulate detergent or in a unit dosage which is formed into a tablet.<br>
The processes of the invention may comprise the step of adding to the mixer a binder to facilitate production of the desired detergent particles. Generally such a binder will be liquid in the form of a solution or melt and will be added by spraying either directly into the mixer or onto the particulate components as they travel into the mixer. Preferably the binder is added directly • into the mixer for example by spraying. The binder is added for purposes of enhancing agglomeration by providing a binding or sticking agent for detergent components. The binder may be any conventional detergent binding agent, preferably selected from the group consisting of water, anionic surfactants, nonionic surfactants, polyethylene glycol, polyvinyl pyrrolidonc.<br>
polyacrylates, organic acids or their salts such as citric acid or citric salts, and mixtures thereof. Other suitable binder materials including those listed herein are described in Beerse et al, US Patent number 5108646 (Procter and Gamble Company), the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. The binder must be compatible with the detergent active particulate as will be appreciated by persons skilled in the art. Thus, where the stability of the detergent active particulate is adversely affected by water, the binder will be substantially water-free.<br>
Thus, in one aspect of the invention, a first feed stream of detergent base powder is fed into the mixer and in addition a second feed stream comprising a detergent active particulates is fed into the mixer and binder is also present in the mixer. The binder may be fed directly via a third stream into the mixer or it may be contacted with the detergent base particles or detergent active particulates prior to one or both of these feed streams entering the mixer, for example the detergent active particulate (or a proportion of the base particles) may be entrained in the binder. Where the mixer is divided into different zones, the three components may be fed into the same zone or optionally may be fed into different zones. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the detergent base particles and detergent active particulates will be pre-mixed prior to addition of the binder.<br>
In a further preferred aspect of the invention, after mixing of the detergent base particles and detergent active particulates, so that adhesion of the two components has taken place, a further liquid component is applied to the outside of the particles produced. This further coating may be the same chemical composition as the binder or may be any of the other coating materials or detergent ingredients described below.<br>
The moderate to low shear mixer to be used in the present invention may be for example a Lodige KM (trademark) (Ploughshare) moderate speed mixer, or mixer made by Fukae, Draes, Schugi or similar brand mixers which mix with only moderate to low shear. The Lodige KM (ploughshare) moderate speed mixer which is a preferred mixer for use in the present invention comprises a horizontal hollow static cylinder having a centrally mounted rotating shaft around which several plough-shaped blades are attached. Preferably, the shaft rotates at a speed of from about 15 rpm to about 140 rpm, more preferably from about 80 rpm to about 120 rpm. The grinding or pulverizing is accomplished by cutters, generally smaller in size than the rotating shaft, which preferably operate at about 3600 rpm. Other mixers similar in nature which are ' suitable for use in the process include the Lodige Ploughshare™ mixer and the Drais® K-T 160 mixer. Generally, in the processes of the present invention, the shear will be no greater than the shear produced by a Lodige KM mixer with the tip speed of the ploughs below 10 m/s, or even below 8m/s or even lower.<br>
Preferably, the mean residence time of the various starting detergent ingredients in the low or moderate speed mixer is preferably in range from about 0.1 minutes to about 30 minutes, most preferably the residence time is about 0.5 to about 5 minutes. In this way, the density of the resulting detergent agglomerates is at the desired level.<br>
Other suitable mixers for use in the present invention are low or very low shear mixers such as rotating bowl agglomerators. drum agglomerators, pan agglomerators and fluid bed agglomerators.<br>
Fluid bed agglomerators arc particularly preferred. Typical fluidised bed agglomerators are operated at a superficial air velocity of from 0.1 to 4 m/s, either under positive or negative pressure. Inlet air temperatures generally range from -10 or 5°C up to 250°C. However inlet air temperatures are generally below 200°C, or even below 150°C. The fluidized bed granulator is preferably operated such that the flux number FN of the fluid bed is at least about 2.5 to about 4.5. Flux number (FNm) is a ratio of the excess velocity (Ue) of the fluidisation gas and the particle density (pp) relative to the mass flux (qliq) of the liquid sprayed into the bed at a normalized distance (D0) of the spraying device. The flux number provides an estimation of the operating parameters of a fluidized bed to control granulation within the bed. The flux number may be expressed either as the mass flux as determined by the following formula:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
the volume flux as determined by the formula:<br>
where qvlig| is the volume of spray into the fluid bed. Calculation of the flux number and a description of its usefulness is fully described in WO 98/58046 the disclosure of which is herein incorporated by reference.<br>
In addition, the fluidized bed is generally operated at a Stokes number of less than about 1, more preferably from about 0.1 to about 0.5. The Stokes number is a measure of particle coalescence for describing the degree of mixing occurring to particles in a piece of equipment such as the fluid bed. The Stokes number is measured by the formula:<br>
Stokes number = 4pvd/9u<br>
wherein p is the apparent particle density, v is the excess velocity, d is the mean particle diameter and u is the viscosity of the binder. The Stokes number and a description of its<br>
usefulness is described in detail in WO 99/03964. the disclosure of which is herein incorporated by reference.<br>
Thus, where the mixer is a fluid bed mixer, detergent base particles of the present invention are passed into a fluid bed optionally having multiple internal "stages" or "zones". A stage or zone is any discrete area within the fluid bed, and these terms are used interchangeably herein. The process conditions within a stage may be different or similar to the other stages in the fluid bed/dryer. It is understood that two adjacent fluid beds are equivalent to a single fluid bed having multiple stages. The various feed streams of detergent base particles and detergent active particulates can be added either at the same or at the different stages, depending on. for example, the particle size and moisture level of the feed stream. Feeding different streams to different stages can minimize the heat load on the fluid bed. and optimize the particle size and increase uniformity of the shape of the detergent particles produced.<br>
The bed is typically fluidized with heated air in order to dry or partially dry moisture such as the binder liquids from the ingredients in the fluid bed. Where binder is sprayed into the fluid bed the spraying is generally achieved via nozzles capable of delivering a fine or atomized spray of the binder to achieve intimate nixing with the particulates. Typically, the droplet size from the atomizer is less than about 2 times the particle size. This atomization can be achieved cither through a conventional two-fluid nozzle with atomizing air, or alternatively by means of a conventional pressure nozzle. To achieve this type of atomization, the solution or slurry rheology is may have a viscosity of less than about 500 centipoise, preferably less than about 200 centipoisc at the point of atomization. While the nozzle location in the fluid bed may be in most any location, the preferred location is a positioning that allows a vertical down spray of any liquid components such as binder. This may be achieved for example, using a top spray configuration. To achieve best results, the nozzle location is placed at or above the fluidized height of the panicles in the fluid bed. The fluidized height is typically determined by a weir or overflow gate height. The agglomeration/granulation zone of the fluid bed may be followed by an optional coating zone, followed by a drying zone and a cooling zone. Of course, one of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that alternative arrangements are also possible to achieve the resultant particles of the present invention.<br>
Typical conditions within a fluid bed apparatus of the present invention include: (i) a mean residence time from about 1 to about 20 minutes, (ii) a depth of unfluidised bed of from about 100 to about 600 mm, (iii) a droplet spray size of less than 2 times the mean particle size in the bed, which is preferably not more than about 100 micron more preferably not more than 50 microns, (iv) spray height generally from 150 to 1600 mm of spray height from the fluid bed<br><br>
plate or preferably 0 to 600mm from the top of the fluid bed , (v) from about 0.1 to about 4.0 m/s. preferably 1.0 to 3.0m/s of fluidizing velocity and (vi) from about 12 to about 200 °C of bed temperature, preferably 15 to 100°C. Once again, one of ordinary skill in the art will recognise that the conditions in the fluid bed may vary depending on a number of factors.<br>
The detergent panicles produced in the mixer can be further processed by adding a coating agent to improve the particle colour, increase the particle whiteness or improve the particle flowability after the detergent particles exit the mixer or the dryer if an optional drying step is added subsequently to the mixer or in a later stage in the mixer, to obtain the high density granular detergent compositions produced by the processes of the invention. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that a wide variety of methods may be used to dry as well as cool the exiting detergent without departing from the scope of the invention. Since the mixer can be operated at relatively low temperatures, the need for cooling apparatus is generally not required in the present process which thereby further reduces manufacturing costs of the final product.<br>
Another optional processing step includes continuously adding a coating agent such as zeolite and/or fumed silica to the mixer to facilitate free flowability of the resulting detergent particles and to prevent over agglomeration. Such coating agents generally have a mean particle size below 100 microns, preferably below 60 microns, even more preferably below 50 microns.<br>
Any coating stage may take place either immediately after formation of the detergent particles of the invention either before or after any drying step and optionally after the detergent panicles have been mixed with additional detergent ingredients for forming a fully formulated detegent composition. Preferably any such coating agent will also have detergent active properties. A particularly preferred coating agent is a surfactant or aqueous solution of surfactant.<br>
Detergent ingredients which are suitable as ingredients of the base powder, and/or as ingredients of the detergent active particulates and/or as ingredients of any additional ingredients added to the detergent particles of the present invention to form the fully formulated detergent compositions of the invention are described below.<br>

The following are examples of the present invention.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
This Example illustrates a process according to this invention which produces uniform free flowing, good dispensing and dissolving detergent particles with uniformity of colour and particle shape. Multiple detergent starting ingredients are dry mixed in an orbital vertical screw mixer of 200kg batch size, and several batches prepared.   This bulk premix is added into a horizontal rotating drum type mixer with internal baffles - a laboratory scale example having batch size 40kg. A proportion of premix is sampled and added to the mixer. The smaller particles which pose a segregation risk are dry mixed into the mixer.<br>
Binding agent, C45AE7, is sprayed into the mixer using an air atomised nozzle. The product is left to mix for 2 minutes and anti-caking agent (zeolite A) is added into the mixer and mixed for a further 1 minute. The product is run into a storage box. Other detergent additives<br>
such as enzymes, pcrcarbonate and dyed carbonate speckles are post-added in a mixing step with<br>
other liquid additives such as perfume, to form the final detergent.<br>
