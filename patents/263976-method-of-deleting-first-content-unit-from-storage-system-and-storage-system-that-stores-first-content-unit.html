METHODS AND APPARATUS FOR MANAGING DELETION OF DATA<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to data storage and, more particularly, to methods<br>
and apparatus for managing the deletion of data stored on a storage system.<br>
Description of the Related Art<br>
Storage systems often have limited data storage capacity. Accordingly, data<br>
stored on a storage system is sometimes intentionally deleted to make storage space<br>
available for new data. Data may also be deleted unintentionally, for example, if a user<br>
deletes data that is still being used, believing that it is no longer needed. Additionally,<br>
data on a storage system may be deleted in an unauthorized manner by a malicious user<br>
seeking to wreak havoc on an organization's data or trying to cover up unscrupulous<br>
activities documented in the data.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
One illustrative embodiment of the invention is directed to a method of deleting a<br>
content unit from a storage system. The method comprises acts of: receiving a request to<br>
delete the content unit; in response to the request, creating a reflection that identifies the<br>
content unit; storing the reflection on the storage system; and removing the content unit<br>
from the storage system. Another illustrative embodiment is directed to at least one<br>
computer readable medium encoded with instructions that, when executed on a computer<br>
system, perform the above-described method.<br>
A further illustrative embodiment is directed to a storage system that stores a<br>
content unit. The storage system comprises: an input; and at least one controller, coupled<br>

Detailed Description<br>
Applicants have appreciated that prior art storage systems may allow deletion of<br>
data stored thereon, but may provide limited or no capability to track deletions or to<br><br>
WO 2006/076481	PCT/US2006/001064<br>
-5-<br>
recover unintentionally deleted data. Thus, it may be difficult or impossible for a system<br>
administrator to determine when data was deleted, why the data was deleted, and who<br>
deleted it.<br>
An example of a particular type of storage system is a content addressable storage<br>
(CAS) system that receives and processes requests to delete units of content identified by<br>
content addresses. CAS is a technique by which a unit of content stored on a storage<br>
system is accessed using an address that is derived from the content of the unit of<br>
content. As an example, the content unit may be provided as an input to a hashing<br>
function which generates a hash value that can be used as the content address for the unit<br>
of content. An example of a hashing function suitable for generating content addresses is<br>
the message digest 5 (MD5) hashing algorithm. When a host computer sends a request<br>
to a CAS system to retrieve a unit of data, the host provides the content address (e.g.,<br>
hash value) of the unit of content. The storage system then determines, based on the<br>
content address, the physical location of the unit of content in the storage system,<br>
retrieves the unit of content from that location, and returns the unit of content to the host<br>
computer. Exemplary CAS systems are described in greater detail in the patent<br>
applications listed in Table 1 below, each of which is hereby incorporated by reference in<br>
its entirety.<br>
CAS systems may store and manage content units in numerous ways. In the<br>
exemplary systems described in the applications in Table 1, content units may be stored<br>
as files in a file system and various databases may be used to manage the content units<br>
and track the storage location of content units on the CAS system. When the CAS<br>
system receives a request to delete a particular content unit, it may remove the file<br>
associated with that content unit from the file system and delete the references to the<br>
content unit in the CAS system databases. Thus, when the CAS system receives<br>
subsequent requests to read the content unit, the CAS system will not be able to locate<br>
and retrieve the content unit (despite the fact that the actual content data may still be<br>
stored in the storage system, e.g., on disk, when the CAS system uses disk storage).<br>
Conventional CAS systems do not log the deletion or create an audit trail to allow<br>
subsequent tracking of the deletion.<br>
In addition, Applicants have recognized that in prior art CAS systems where units<br>
of content are mirrored on a CAS system, a content unit that has been deleted may<br><br>
WO 2006/076481	PCT/US2006/001064<br>
-6-<br>
undesirably be regenerated by the CAS system. This situation may occur, for example,<br>
when the CAS system is a distributed storage system. A distributed storage system is<br>
one that includes a plurality of independent nodes, each with its own processing<br>
resources, that are coupled together (e.g., by a communications network) and operate<br>
together to provide storage system functionality. In some of the exemplary CAS systems<br>
described in the applications in Table 1, the independent nodes may include access nodes<br>
which process access requests and storage nodes which store data. When a content unit<br>
is stored on one of the storage nodes, the content unit may be mirrored to another storage<br>
node so that a mirrored copy of the content unit exists in case the primary storage node<br>
fails. However, if one of the storage nodes that stores a content unit is offline (e.g., due<br>
to temporary failure) when the CAS system receives a request to delete a content unit,<br>
the content unit may not be deleted from that storage node. The CAS system may have a<br>
background process that controls the replication process and ensures that content units<br>
are replicated. Thus, when the storage node comes back online, the background process<br>
that checks to ensure content units are mirrored may determine that the content unit is<br>
not mirrored and may create a mirror copy of the content unit on a different storage node<br>
and repopulate the CAS systems databases with information pertaining to the content<br>
unit. Consequently, the CAS system may return the content unit in response to future<br>
read requests, even though a delete request for the content unit was received and<br>
processed.<br>
In addition, a CAS system may be configured to replicate data to a remote CAS<br>
system (i.e., to mirror content units to the remote CAS system). Thus, any write request<br>
received by a local CAS system may be replicated to a remote CAS system (e.g., so that<br>
a mirror image of the CAS system exists in case of catastrophic failure). However,<br>
Applicants have appreciated that delete requests may not be replicated. That is, when a<br>
delete request for a content unit is processed by a local CAS system, the content unit is<br>
only deleted from that CAS system and is not processed by the remote CAS system.<br>
Thus, if a content unit is stored on both the local and remote CAS systems, a delete<br>
request for the content unit may result in deletion of only one copy of the content unit, so<br>
that one or more copies of the unit may still exist.<br>
Additionally, Applicants have appreciated that some prior art CAS systems<br>
cannot guarantee replication of a content unit before it is deleted. That is, for example, a<br><br>
WO 2006/076481	PCT/US2006/001064<br>
-7-<br>
user may have a local CAS system configured such that every content unit that is stored<br>
thereto is archived to a remote CAS system. The user may desire that when a content<br>
unit is deleted from the local CAS system, the content unit is not deleted from the remote<br>
CAS system, so that the remote CAS system stores every content unit written to the local<br>
CAS system, regardless of whether the content unit is still stored by the local CAS<br>
system. However, replication may occur asynchronously. That is, a content unit that is<br>
stored to the local CAS system may not immediately be replicated to the remote CAS<br>
system. Thus, before a content unit is replicated to the remote CAS system, the local<br>
CAS system may receive a delete request for the content unit and delete it. As a result,<br>
the content unit may be deleted from the local CAS system and may never be replicated<br>
to the remote CAS system, as intended.<br>
Applicants have further appreciated that in prior art CAS systems, the amount of<br>
storage space that is freed by a deletion is not logged. Thus, it is difficult to determine<br>
how much storage space is available on the CAS system. For example, the amount of<br>
storage capacity available may be determined by keeping a running tally of the total size<br>
of all content units written to the storage system and subtracting this number from the<br>
total available capacity. However, Applicants have appreciated that when a content unit<br>
is deleted, the size of the content unit is not added back to the total available capacity to<br>
account for the amount of storage space freed by the deletion.<br>
Various embodiments of the invention address some of these limitations of prior<br>
art storage systems. However, it should be appreciated that every embodiment of the<br>
invention does not necessarily overcome all of these limitations. Indeed, embodiments<br>
of the invention may address some, all, or none of the above-discussed prior art<br>
limitations.<br>
One embodiment of the invention is directed to tracking the deletion of content<br>
units on a storage system so that a record exists relating to the deletion. Such a record<br>
can be stored in any suitable manner, as the present invention is not limited in this<br>
respect. In one embodiment, when the storage system receives a request to delete a<br>
content unit, the storage system may create another content unit, referred to herein as a<br>
reflection, to replace the content unit and include information that may be used to track<br>
the deletion of the content unit. The reflection may be stored on the storage system (or<br><br>
WO 2006/076481	PCT/US2006/001064<br>
-8-<br>
elsewhere) and the content unit requested for deletion may be deleted, designated for<br>
deletion, or moved.<br>
An example of a storage system on which some embodiments of the invention<br>
may be implemented is shown in Figure 4. In Figure 4, storage system 401 includes a<br>
processor 405, a network interface 403 which may be coupled to a network to allow<br>
storage system 401 to send and receive communications over the network, a memory 409<br>
(e.g., random access memory), and a storage device 407 (e.g., a disk drive) on which<br>
data, such as content units, may be stored.<br>
It should be appreciated that the storage system depicted in Figure 4 is only one<br>
example of a storage system on which embodiments of the invention may be<br>
implemented and the invention is not limited in this respect, as storage systems on which<br>
embodiments of the invention may be implemented may differ in material respects from<br>
the storage system depicted in Figure 4. For example, in Figure 4, storage system 401<br>
includes only one storage device 407 and one processor 405. The invention is not<br>
limited in this respect as the storage system on which the invention is implemented may<br>
include any suitable number of storage devices and/or any suitable number of processors.<br>
In addition, the storage system may be a distributed storage system (described above in<br>
greater detail) that includes a number of independent nodes, each of which includes<br>
separate storage devices and processing resources.<br>
An example of the processing of a delete request is shown in Figure 2. hi Figure<br>
2, computer system 200 includes a host computer 201 and a storage system 203 that<br>
stores a content unit 207. The storage system may be any type of storage system. In one<br>
embodiment, the storage system 203 may be a CAS system taking any of the forms<br>
described in the applications listed in Table 1. However, the present invention is not<br>
limited in this respect and can be used with storage systems of other types. In response<br>
to a request 205 to delete content unit 207 a reflection 209 may be created (e.g., by the<br>
storage system 203) that identifies content unit 207 and may include additional<br>
information about content unit 207 and its deletion.<br>
The reflection may include any suitable information. For example, the reflection<br>
may include a portion (or all) of the content of the content unit to be deleted, information<br>
identifying the content unit to be deleted, and/or audit information. The audit<br>
information may include, for example, the time of deletion of the content unit, the user or<br><br>
WO 2006/076481	PCT/US2006/001064<br>
-9-<br>
application program that generated the request to delete the content unit, the network<br>
address of the computer that generated the request to delete the content unit, the size of<br>
the content unit to be deleted, and/or any other suitable information.<br>
In one embodiment, the reflection may also include a flag that indicates that the<br>
reflection is a reflection and/or not an actual content unit. The flag may be included in<br>
the reflection in any suitable way, as the invention is not limited in this respect. For<br>
example, the flag may be part of the content of the reflection. In embodiments of the<br>
invention where the reflection is stored on the storage system as a file in a file system,<br>
the flag may be part of the file name of the reflection, but the embodiment directed to<br>
storing the reflection is not limited in this respect. In embodiments of the invention<br>
implemented on a CAS system, the reflection may be assigned a content address<br>
computed, at least in part, from the content of the reflection. The flag indicating that the<br>
content unit is a reflection may form a part of the content address of the reflection. The<br>
CAS system may store content units as files in a file system and use the content address<br>
of the content unit as the file name (or part of the file name) of the file for the content<br>
unit. In this respect, the flag indicating that a content unit is a reflection may be located<br>
in the content address of the reflection and the file name of the file for the reflection. It<br>
should be appreciated that the embodiment directed to use on a CAS system is not<br>
limited to use on a CAS system that employs a file system to store content units and/or<br>
reflections. Indeed, the CAS system may store content units in any suitable way as the<br>
invention is not limited in this respect. In this respect, the invention is not limited to<br>
placing the content address of a content unit in the file name of a file, as the content<br>
address may be associated with the content in any suitable way (e.g., using a database<br>
table).<br>
The reflection may identify the content unit that it corresponds to so that it can be<br>
determined to which content unit the information stored in the reflection pertains and so<br>
that the information stored in the reflection can be found. A reflection of a particular<br>
content unit may identify the content unit in any suitable way. For example, the content<br>
of the reflection may include information identifying the content unit (e.g., the file name<br>
of the content unit when it is stored in a file system). In embodiments of the invention<br>
for use with a CAS system, the content address of the content unit may be included in the<br>
reflection. For example, the content address for the deleted content unit may be included<br><br>
WO 2006/076481	PCT/US2006/001064<br>
-10-<br>
in the content of the reflection or may be included in the content address of the<br>
reflection.<br>
For example, the content address of the reflection may include a hash value<br>
generated, at least in part, from the content of the reflection and the content address of<br>
the content unit that the reflection corresponds to. The content address of the reflection<br>
may also include additional information, such as a timestamp that indicates the time (or<br>
the approximate time) at which the reflection was created, a guaranteed unique identifier<br>
(GUID) which is a unique value that may be included in the content address to guarantee<br>
that no two content units have the same content address, and/or any other suitable<br>
information. Thus, for example, as shown in Figure 3, a reflection 303 may be hashed<br>
using a hash function 307, resulting in a hash value 309 of DEF456. The reflection may<br>
replace a content unit 301 having a content address 305 of ABC123. The content address<br>
305 may combined with the hash value 309 to result in a content address 311 of<br>
ABC123.DEF456 for reflection 303. It should be appreciated that the content addresses<br>
provided in the example above are only examples of suitable formats for content<br>
addresses and the invention is not limited in this respect. That is, in the example above,<br>
the content addresses are ASCII character representations of a binary number. The<br>
content addresses need not be represented by ASCII characters, as the invention is not<br>
limited in this respect. In addition, in the example provided above the content addresses<br>
for content units include six characters and the content addresses for reflections include<br>
twelve characters. The invention is not limited in this respect as such content addresses<br>
may include any suitable number of characters (or binary digits).<br>
In the embodiments wherein a hash of the content of the reflection is computed<br>
and stored, the integrity of the reflection may be validated at a later time. For example,<br>
when a reflection is accessed, the content of the reflection may be hashed and compared<br>
to the previously computed hash value of the content address. If the two values do not<br>
match, then the content of the reflection may have been corrupted or altered.<br>
As discussed above, in response to a delete request for a content unit, the content<br>
unit may be deleted, designated for deletion, or moved to a different location. This may<br>
be done in any suitable way, as the invention is not limited in this respect. For example,<br>
if the content unit is stored as a file in a file system, the file corresponding to the content<br>
unit may be removed from the file system.<br><br>

As mentioned above, one embodiment can be used with the types of CAS<br>
systems described in the applications in Table 1. Some of those CAS systems may store<br>
content in units termed blobs. A blob may be, for example, binary data, such as, for<br>
example, a patient x-ray, company financial records, or any other type of data. Each<br>
blob has at least one content descriptor file (CDF) associated with it. The CDF<br>
associated with a blob may include metadata for the blob and a reference to the blob<br>
(e.g., the content address of the blob). A CDF may reference multiple blobs or CDFs, so<br>
that the CDF includes multiple references and metadata for the referenced blobs. The<br>
CAS system may not allow direct deletion of blobs. That is, CDFs may be directly<br>
deleted, but requests to delete blobs may be denied by the CAS system. Blobs may be<br>
deleted by a background garbage collection process of the CAS system that determines if<br>
a blob is referenced by any CDFs. If the blob is not referenced by any CDFs, the blob<br>
may be deleted by the garbage collection process.<br>
In accordance with one embodiment for use with a CAS system of the type just<br>
described that stores content as blobs and CDFs, a delete request may be processed as<br>
shown in Figure 1. At act 101, a request to delete a CDF is received by the CAS system.<br>
The process proceeds to act 103, where the CAS system creates a reflection to replace<br>
the CDF. The reflection can be created in any suitable manner. As discussed above, the<br>
CAS system may include one or more databases that are used to manage content units<br>
and track the location of content units on the CAS system. In accordance with one<br>
embodiment of the invention, when the reflection is created, these databases may be<br>
updated to include the reflection, for example, to allow the reflection to be found in<br>
response to subsequent read requests.<br>
Next, the process proceeds to act 105, where any references to the CDF in the<br>
databases of the CAS system may be removed. The process then continues to act 107,<br>
where the CDF is moved to a temporary directory hi the file system. Once references to<br>
the CDF are deleted from the CAS systems' databases and the CDF is moved from its<br>
file system location, subsequent requests to access the CDF will fail. The CDF may be<br>
held in the temporary directory for garbage collection purposes. That is, the CAS system<br>
may maintain a reference count for each blob stored on the CAS system that indicates the<br>
number of CDFs referencing the blob. The background garbage collection process may<br>
periodically examine the temporary directory and may update the reference counts for<br><br>
WO 2006/076481	PCT/US2006/001064<br>
-12-<br>
blobs corresponding to CDFs found in the temporary directory. That is, the garbage<br>
collection process may go to the temporary directory in which the deleted CDF is<br>
located, determine the blobs that the CDF references, and decrement the reference counts<br>
of those blobs. The garbage collection process may then determine if any of the<br>
reference counts of the blobs referenced by the CDF are zero and may delete any blobs<br>
whose reference count is zero. Once processing for a CDF in the temporary directory is<br>
complete, the garbage collection process may remove the CDF from the file system.<br>
As mentioned above, in one embodiment, in response to a delete request, a<br>
content unit may be deleted from the storage system on which it resides but be moved to<br>
another storage location to keep alive the possibility that the content unit could be<br>
retrieved. This may be done in any suitable way. For example, the reflection may be<br>
created to include information that indicates the location of the content unit on the other<br>
storage system. In one embodiment, the other storage system is a tape storage system.<br>
However, it should be appreciated the invention is not limited in this respect, as the<br>
storage location to which a deleted content unit is moved may be any suitable storage<br>
location, such as, for example, a location on a storage system that employs magnetic or<br>
optical disc storage devices.<br>
As mentioned above, in some prior art systems in which content units written to a<br>
local CAS system are replicated to another remote CAS system, a delete request for a<br>
content unit to the local CAS system may not be replicated to the remote CAS system<br>
that also stores the content unit, so that the content unit is not deleted from the remote<br>
CAS system. In one embodiment of the invention in which a CAS system is configured<br>
to replicate content units to one or more remote CAS systems, when a content unit is<br>
deleted on the CAS system, the content unit may also be deleted on any remote CAS<br>
systems to which the content unit was previously replicated. This may be done in any<br>
suitable way. For example, reflections of deleted content units may be replicated to the<br>
remote CAS system(s). That is, when a CAS system receives a delete request for a<br>
content unit, the content unit may be deleted and a reflection may be created on the CAS<br>
system. The reflection may then be replicated to any other CAS system that stores a<br>
copy of the content unit. The other CAS system may be configured to, when it receives<br>
the replicated reflection, find the content unit that replaces it and delete it using any<br>
suitable technique (an example of which is described above in connection with Figure 1).<br><br>
WO 2006/076481	PCT/US2006/001064<br>
-13-<br>
In some situations, it may be desired that data deleted from a local CAS system<br>
not be deleted on a remote CAS system to which it was previously replicated, so that the<br>
remote CAS system may serve as an archive for the local CAS system (e.g., so that<br>
content units deleted from the local CAS system may be recovered). In such situations,<br>
when a reflection is replicated from the local CAS system to the remote CAS system, the<br>
remote CAS system may store the reflection, but may not delete the content unit<br>
associated with the reflection. Alternatively, in such situations, reflections may not be<br>
replicated from the local CAS system to the remote CAS system.<br>
As discussed above, in situations where a local CAS system is configured to<br>
replicate content units to a remote CAS system, it may be desirable to ensure that a<br>
content unit stored to the local CAS system is replicated to the remote CAS system<br>
before it is deleted from the local CAS system. In one embodiment of the invention for<br>
use in systems configured to remotely replicate content units, content units may not be<br>
deleted from a local CAS system until they have been replicated to a remote CAS<br>
system. This may be done in any suitable way. For example, the local CAS system may<br>
be configured to delete a content unit only after the reflection for the content unit has<br>
been replicated. When a delete request for the content unit is received by the local CAS<br>
system, a reflection for the content unit may be created, but deletion of the content unit<br>
may be postponed. The replication process executing on the local CAS system may be<br>
configured to replicate content units in time order, so that content units created first are<br>
replicated first, and will eventually replicate the reflection for the content unit. Once the<br>
reflection for the content unit has been replicated, the content unit may be deleted from<br>
the local CAS system. In addition, because the content unit was created before the<br>
reflection, the content unit will have already been replicated to the remote CAS system.<br>
' When the remote system receives the reflection, it may delete the content unit or<br>
maintain it, as described above.<br>
In the examples above, CAS systems were designated as local CAS systems and<br>
remote CAS systems. The terms local and remote in the examples above are used merely<br>
to differentiate between a CAS system that receives a request (i.e., a local CAS system)<br>
and a CAS system to which the request is replicated (i.e., a remote CAS system). The<br>
terms local and remote, as used above, are not intended to imply a physical distance<br>
between the CAS systems. While local and remote CAS systems may indeed be located<br><br>
WO 2006/076481	PCT/US2006/001064<br>
-14-<br>
a great physical distance apart, the aspects of the invention that relate to techniques for<br>
use with replicated content units are not limited in this respect as the local and remote<br>
CAS systems may also be in the same room, or the same computer cabinet or rack.<br>
Once a content unit is deleted from the storage system, subsequent requests for<br>
the content unit will not locate the content unit and access requests for the content unit<br>
will fail. Access requests may include, for example, read requests, exists requests, or<br>
delete requests. An exists requests is a request to the storage system to determine if a<br>
particular content unit exists (i.e., is stored) on the storage system. For example, the<br>
storage system may receive a request to read a previously-deleted content unit that<br>
identifies the content unit by its content address. The storage system may attempt to<br>
locate the content unit, based on its content address. Examples of techniques that may be<br>
used to locate a content unit on a storage system are discussed in the patent applications<br>
listed in Table 1. However, the invention is not limited to any of these examples, as the<br>
locating of a content unit on a storage system may be performed in any suitable way. In<br>
the examples above wherein content units are listed in a file system or database of the<br>
storage system after deletion, because the content unit is not listed in the file system or<br>
databases of the storage system, the content unit will not be located by the storage<br>
system. However, when searching based on the content address of the deleted content<br>
unit, the storage system may find the reflection of the content unit that was created when<br>
the content unit was deleted. This may be done in any suitable way. For example, when<br>
the reflection of the deleted content unit includes the content address of the deleted<br>
content unit, a search for the content address of the content unit will locate the reflection.<br>
When the storage system finds a reflection of the content unit and does not find the<br>
content unit itself, the storage system may response to the access request in any suitable<br>
manner, as the invention is not limited in this respect. For example, the storage system<br>
may indicate to the requesting entity that the content unit does not exist. Alternatively,<br>
the storage system may indicate that a reflection exists and/or may return the reflection.<br>
In some situations, the storage system may find both a reflection for a content<br>
unit and the content unit itself. This may occur, for example, in embodiments of the<br>
invention implemented on a distributed CAS system, where the CAS system stores two<br>
copies of a content unit on two different storage nodes. For example, as shown in Figure<br><br>
WO 2006/076481	PCT/US2006/001064<br>
-15-<br>
5, if a first of the two storage nodes (i.e., node 501) is offline when a delete request for<br>
the content unit is received, the content unit may be deleted from the second storage node<br>
(i.e., node 503). However, because node 501 is offline, the content unit may not be<br>
deleted from node 501. Further, a reflection 505 for the content unit may be created on<br>
node 503, but not on node 501. When node 501 later comes back online, in response to a<br>
subsequent request to access the content unit, the storage system may find both the<br>
reflection 505 that was created in response to the delete request and the content unit itself<br>
(i.e., content unit 507).<br>
When both a reflection for a content unit and the content unit are found in<br>
response to an access request, the storage system may respond in any suitable manner.<br>
For example, as shown in Figure 5, the storage system may determine which was stored<br>
on the storage system first. If the content unit was stored prior to the reflection, then the<br>
storage system may determine that an attempted deletion of the content unit failed (e.g.,<br>
due to temporary failure of the storage node) and may, for example, delete the content<br>
unit or treat the content unit as if it does not exist. If the reflection was stored prior to the<br>
content unit, then the storage system may determine that the content unit was re-written<br>
to the storage system after the deletion request was processed and therefore should<br>
remain in existence on the storage system.<br>
The storage system may determine which of the two content units was stored first<br>
in any suitable way, as the invention is not limited in this respect. For example, in one<br>
embodiment of the invention, the content address of a content unit may include a<br>
timestamp that indicates when the content unit was initially stored. The storage system<br>
may examine the timestamps of the content units (i.e., the original content unit and the<br>
reflection) to determine when each was stored. It should be appreciated that this is only<br>
one example of a way in which the storage system may determine the time at which a<br>
content unit was stored to the storage system and that the invention is not limited in this<br>
respect.<br>
In one embodiment, the storage system may process query requests for<br>
reflections. A query request is a request to return information (e.g., content addresses)<br>
associated with content units (and/or the content units themselves) that meet the criterion<br>
or criteria specified in the request. For example, a query may request information<br>
relating to all content units deleted during a certain time range. In response, the storage<br><br>
WO 2006/076481	PCT/US2006/001064<br>
-16-<br>
system may identify all the reflections created during the time range (e.g., using the<br>
timestamps in the content address of the reflections) and return information associated<br>
with the deleted content units (e.g., the content addresses of the reflections and/or the<br>
reflections themselves).<br>
Applicants have appreciated that when a storage system has been in operation for<br>
an extended period of time, the storage system may store a large number of reflections<br>
which occupy storage capacity in the storage system. Thus, in one embodiment of the<br>
invention, reflections themselves may be deleted (i.e., without being replaced by another<br>
reflection). This may be done in any suitable way. For example, the storage system may<br>
include a background garbage collection process that deletes reflections after they have<br>
been stored for a certain period of time. Alternatively, the storage system may allow<br>
reflections to be directly deleted by users of the storage system (e.g., using delete<br>
requests that identify the reflections by their content addresses).<br>
In one embodiment, the deletion of reflections may be managed through the use<br>
of retention periods. As discussed in greater detail in application serial no. 10/731,790,<br>
entitled "Method And Apparatus For Data Retention In A Storage System," listed in<br>
Table 1, a retention period is a period of time associated with a content unit during which<br>
the content unit may not be deleted. A retention period may be associated with a<br>
reflection when the reflection is created and the storage system may be configured such<br>
that after expiration of the retention period, the storage system deletes the reflection.<br>
Alternatively, retention classes may be used to aid in the deletion of reflections. As<br>
discussed in greater detail in application serial no. 10/762,044, entitled "Methods And<br>
Apparatus For Modifying A Retention Period For Data In A Storage System," listed in<br>
Table 1, a retention class applies to a group of content units that all have the same<br>
retention period by virtue of being placed into the retention class. A retention class may<br>
be created for reflections and may have a certain retention period associated with it.<br>
When a reflection is created, it may be placed in the retention class, thereby assigning it a<br>
retention period. When its retention period has expired, the reflection may be<br>
automatically deleted by the storage system.<br>
It should be appreciated that the use of retention periods is only one way in which<br>
the deletion of reflections may be managed and the invention is not limited in this<br>
respect, as the deletion of reflections may be managed in any suitable way. In addition,<br><br>
WO 2006/076481	PCT/US2006/001064<br>
-17-<br>
the invention does not require that reflections be deleted, as reflections may remain on<br>
the storage system without being deleted.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, a content unit may be restored for any<br>
purpose (e.g., if it is realized the content unit was unintentionally deleted and it is desired<br>
to recover the content unit). This may be accomplished in any suitable way. For<br>
example, when a content unit is deleted and a reflection is created to replace the content<br>
unit, the entire content of the content unit may be stored in the reflection. Thus, if it is<br>
desired to recover the content unit after its deletion, the content may be recovered from<br>
the reflection and the content unit may be rewritten to the storage system. In<br>
embodiments of the invention in which content units are stored as blobs and CDFs,<br>
reflections for both blobs and CDFs may be used to restore these content units, as the<br>
invention is not limited in this respect.<br>
In accordance with one embodiment of the invention, a technique is employed<br>
that enables a determination of what was stored on the storage system at any given point<br>
in time. This may be done in any suitable way, as this aspect of the present invention is<br>
not limited to any particular implementation technique. For example, when used with<br>
the above-described reflections techniques wherein the entire deleted content unit may be<br>
stored in the reflection, to determine what content units were stored on the storage<br>
system at a particular point in time, a list of all content units, excluding reflections,<br>
currently stored on the storage system may be created. It may then be determined which<br>
content units were written to the storage system after the specified point in time (e.g., by<br>
examining the timestamps in the content addresses of all content units). These content<br>
units may be removed from the list. It may next be determined which content units that<br>
were written before the specified time were deleted after the specified time. This may be<br>
accomplished, for example, by finding all reflections with a timestamp after the specified<br>
date and determining if the content unit replaced by each of these reflections was written<br>
to the storage system before the specified date. The time at which a deleted content unit<br>
was written to the storage system may be determined in any suitable way (e.g., by<br>
examining the content address of its reflection). Because the content address of the<br>
reflection includes the content address of the deleted content unit, the timestamp from the<br>
content address of the content unit is included in the content address of the reflection.<br>
Thus, the time at which the deleted content unit was written to the storage system may be<br><br>
WO 2006/076481	PCT/US2006/001064<br>
-18-<br>
determined by examining this timestamp in the content address of the reflection. Any<br>
reflections of content units that were written before the specified point in time and<br>
deleted after the specified point in time may be added to the list. Thus, the list may<br>
include all content units that were stored on the storage system at the specified point in<br>
time.<br>
In another embodiment, reflections may be used to make fixed content mutable.<br>
For example a content unit may be created with an indefinite retention period. After the<br>
creation of the content unit, it may be desired to alter its retention period (e.g., to three<br>
years). However, the retention period may be stored in the content unit itself and altering<br>
the retention period may alter the content of the content unit Thus, the content unit may<br>
have a different content address after the retention period stored inside the content unit<br>
has been modified. For example, the original content unit with an indefinite retention<br>
period may have a content address of XYZABC. After the retention period is modified<br>
to three years, the content unit may have a content address of KLMNOP. Thus, when an<br>
access request is received for the content address XYZABC, no content unit may be<br>
found, as the content unit's content address has changed.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, when the content unit is modified, resulting<br>
in a change in its content address, a reflection may be created and used as a pointer to the<br>
new content address for the modified content unit. The content address of the reflection<br>
may take any form. In one example, the content address for the reflection may be the<br>
original content address of the content unit, combined with a hash value of the reflection.<br>
Thus, for example, as shown in Figure 6, a content unit 601 having an indefinite<br>
retention period may have a content address of XYZABC. Content unit 601 may be<br>
deleted and replaced with a reflection 603 that has a hash value of QWERTY (and a<br>
content address of XYZABC.QWERTY) and a replacement content unit 605 that has the<br>
same content as content unit 601, but with a retention period of three years. The content<br>
address of content unit 605 may be KLMNOP. The content of reflection 6Q3 may<br>
include a pointer to content unit 605 (e.g., by including the content address of content<br>
unit 605 in its content). Thus, for example, the content of the reflection may include<br>
KLMNOP. When a read request for the content address XYZABC is received, the<br>
storage system may find reflection 603 and determine that the new content address for<br><br>
WO 2006/076481	PCT/US2006/001064<br>
-19-<br>
the content unit is KLMNOP. The storage system may then find the content unit having<br>
the address KLMNOP and return this content unit to the requesting entity.<br>
The above-described embodiments of the present invention can be implemented<br>
on any suitable system. Examples of suitable systems are described in the patent<br>
applications listed below in Table 1 (collectively "the CAS applications"), each of which<br>
is herein incorporated by reference. It should be appreciated that the systems described<br>
in these applications are only examples of systems on which embodiments of the present<br>
invention may be implemented, as the invention is not limited to implementation on a<br>
CAS system, and may be implemented on any suitable type of storage system.<br>
The above-described embodiment in which reflections may be created for use in<br>
the modification of retention periods may be useful, for example, in situations where a<br>
retention period for a content unit is about to expire. That is, once the retention period<br>
for a content unit is about to expire the content unit may be deleted and there may be no<br>
way to find the content unit. However, by creating a replacement content unit that<br>
extends the retention period for the content unit and creating a reflection that points to<br>
the replacement content unit, the content unit may not be unintentionally deleted (or<br>
deleted otherwise) and permanently lost.<br>
