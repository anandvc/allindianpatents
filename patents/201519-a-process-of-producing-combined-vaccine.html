				<td>MANUFACTURING METHOD OF COMBINED VACCINE<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to manufacturing method of combined vaccine capable of preventing concurrently various diseases of infants such as diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, hepatitis B, and other diseases, which should be prevented in infants.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
A combined vaccine is directed to a vaccine manufactured by combining protective antigens for each disease with respect to various other infection diseases or a vaccine manufactured by combining of various related antigens to prevent one infection disease.<br>
As examples of the former, there are a DTP vaccine capable of enhancing an immunity with respect to diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis, a MMR vaccine capable of enhancing an immunity with respect to measles, mumps, and gennan measles,..and so on. The above vaccines have been used for 20 years. As examples of the latter, there are a pneumococcal vaccine manufactured by combining 14 or 23 pneumococcal polysaccharides capable of enhancing an immunity to pneumonia, and a meningococcus vaccine manufactured by combining 4 meningococcal polysaccharides capable of enhancing an immunity to protect meningitis and so on. The above vaccines have been used for a few years.<br>
The above vaccines have been used for many years since its development are well recognized with their high immunogenic effects and less side effect with respect to each infection disease and with their good adaptation to protect various diseases. Vaccine developers are newly developing various types of combined vaccines for the above reasons. As the above combined vaccines, there is a vaccine (Intemational Publication No. WO<br><br>
99/13906) manufactured by combining a DTP vaccine, bacterial encephalomeningitis vaccine (Hib vaccine), inactivated polio vaccine, and hepatitis B vaccine. A certain combined vaccine is developed by the combination of pneumococcal and meningococcal polysaccharides conjugated with protein. A combined vaccine capable of preventing from an intestinal infection with respect to each causing bacteria of cholera, typhoid, dysentery, and diarrhea will be developed soon.<br>
The combined vaccine prepared in the way of combining each antigen for preventing various other infective diseases has advantages in that the number of vaccinations decreases, and the supply of vaccines is simple for thereby decreasing the cost. According to the infant vaccination schedule recommended by Pediatrics Association (1997), the infants gets many times of shot within 1 years after birth, and injection of vaccine is sometimes overiapped with different vaccines due to conveniance or illness. Therefore, it is important to inoculate the infants based on a proper method for thereby providing a certain convenience to both vaccinating persons and inoculated persons. In particular, as the standardized vaccination schedule, the DTP and the hepatitis B vaccinations are guided to perfomi three times of primary shots within the first year of infants and boost shots. In addition, since the vaccination schedules recommended are similar, the problem of overtaping shots can happen.<br>
The inventors of the present invention perfonmed a research for providing a certain convenience for vaccination to both the vaccinating persons and the inoculated persons by developing the combined vaccine of DTP and hepatitis B vaccines and stabilizing of the supply of the vaccine for thereby providing a vaccination benefit to more people.<br>
Since the research on the combined vaccine is mostly directed to combining each component antigen from the vaccine products which is provided in the immunity and stability, the development of the combining method is important to minimize a variation in the reaction and immunity<br><br>
occuring due to an interaction between each protective antigen and adsorbent is important for the above research. With the completion of development, the homogeneity and stability of the combined vaccine formulations invented have been reviewed. In the present invention, the research has been performed based on the DTP vaccine and hepatitis B vaccine which are proved for their immunity and stability.<br>
As a method for combining each component vaccine, there are a method (International Publication Nos. WO 99/13906 and WO 00/7623) of simply combining the products of each component vaccine, a method (International Publication No. WO 99/13906) of administrating simultaneously when the vaccination is perfomied, using the specially designed container, and a method of manufacturing the combined vaccine by mixing each component of vaccine and ingredients in one formulation. Concerning the vaccine supply, the usage of the combined vaccine prepared by the former two methods are similar to the use of each monovalent vaccine singularly it needs more attention to handle vaccines than each monovalent vaccine, so that there is not an advantage in using this type of the combined vaccine. In addition, it is impossible to perform a research with respect to the variation of the immunity and th« occuring of the side effects. Therefore, it is preferable that each vaccine component is mixed in one fomiulation as one product on the research of the combined vaccine.<br>
The purpose of the present invention is to provide a manufacturing method of combined vaccine capable of preventing various diseases of infants including diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis and hepatitis B, which should be prevent in infants.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide manufacturing method of combined vaccine for concurrently preventing various diseases of infants such as diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis and hepatitis B, which<br><br>
should be prevent in infants.<br>
In order to achieve the above object, there is provided a manufacturing method of a combined vaccine, comprising the steps of:<br>
The adsorption step of independently adsorbing each protective antigen to adsorbent respectively with respect to various diseases; and<br>
The combination step of mixing each above protective antigen adsorbed to the adsorbent.<br>
And there is also provided the method wherein the protective antigen is the antigen selected from the group comprising diphtheria antigen, tetanus antigen, pertussis antigen, heptatitis B antigen, or two or more combination thereof.<br>
And there is also provided the method, wherein the adsorbent is aluminum hydroxide gel.<br>
And, in order to achieve the above object, there is provided a combined vaccine as produced according to any of the above methods.<br>
More specifically, the present invention provides the manufacturing method of a combined vaccine which includes the steps of independently adsorbing each protective antigen to an adsorbent of a aluminum hydroxide gel with respect to various diseases such as diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, and hepatitis B which should be prevented in the infants, and combining each protective antigen adsorbed to the adsorbent after the adsorption.<br>
The antigens of the present invention is not limited by the mentioned diseases but applicated to various antigens from various diseases.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
The present invention will become better understood with reference to the accompanying drawings which are given only by way of illustration and thus does not limit to the present invention, wherein;<br>
Fig. 1 is a view illustrating an adsorption ratio of each component antigen based on concentration of an adsortDent. Diphtheria toxoid, tetanus<br><br>
toxoid, and hepatitis B virus surface antigen are a components of diphtheria antigen, tetanus antigen and hepatitis B antigen, and pertussis toxoid and pertussis FHA antigen(pertussis thready shape blood agglutinin corpuscle) are each component of a purified pertussis antigen;<br>
Figs. 2a to 2d are views illustrating an antigenicity and immunity based on an adsorption method wherein sample 1 is a sample in which surplus aluminum hydroxide gel is added after a combination of each component vaccine is completed, and sample 2 is a sample in which the said adsort^ent of the same concentration is previously added before the combination is completed; Figs 2a and 2b are views illustrating the relative antigenicity of samples 1 and 2 respectively and, Figs 2c and 2d are views illustrating the relative level of antibody formation against each antigen of samples 1 and 2, respectively.<br>
Fig. 3 is a view illustrating the level of antibody formation against each antigen in the serum obtained from monkeys administered a combined vaccine prepared according to the present invention or conccurently each vaccine product of DTP and hepatitis B based on the date of collecting blood samples from each monkey. Group 1 is designated that each vaccine of DTP and hepatitis B are concurrently administered, end group 2 is designated that a combined vaccine is administered.<br>
MODES FOR CARRYING OUT THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
As the method for manufacturing the combined vaccine containing each vaccine component as one product, the above method is divided into two steps: a method for the step of combining the antigens which form each component vaccine and perfonning an adsorption using an adsorbent and a method for the step of combining the previously adsorbed antigens, in the case that an adsorbent is used as a component in the said method. However, in the case that each component antigen are first mixed, an adsorption ability with respect to the adsorbent of each antigen may decrease due to the interaction<br><br>
among antigens and ingredients in solution. In addition, the adsorption between the adsorbent and component antigen is optimized under each independent condition. If the above adsorption processes are concurrently performed, the adsorption ratio may be decreased due to a difference in the adsorption condition of each component antigen. Since the interrelationship between the adsorption ratio with respect to the adsorbent of the component antigen and the immunity of the vaccine is in inverse proportion, the immunity of the combined vaccine, which is manufactured in the process performed concurrently, may be decreased compared to the immunity of each monovalent vaccine.<br>
Therefore, the inventors of the present invention have judged that it is proper to manufacture a combined vaccine by prepahng a bulk solution of each component antigen, independently performing an adsorption of each antigen and combining the adsorbed antigens together.<br>
In addition, in the case that each component antigen is combined in each adsorption type, the final concentration of each component antigen in the combined vaccine should be the same as the concentration of the component antigen in each conventional monovalent vaccine, to compare the immunity and the characteristics of vaccine antigens in vaccine products. Therefore, to manufacture the combined vaccine, the component antigen more concentrated than a single vaccine is adsorbed and then combined. The DTP vaccine is manufactured based on an adsorption using the antigen which is concentrated 1.5-^2 limes, and the hepatitis B vaccine is manufactured using the antigen which is concentrated 2^-3 times. The final concentration of each component antigen of the combined vaccine according to the present invention is coincided with the concentration of each single vaccine adjusting the combining ratio of each antigen.<br>
According to the present invention, the inventors performed the various studies of combinations for developing the combined vaccine. In this case, the final content of each immune component in a vaccine product is the same as<br><br>
the content of the monovalent vaccine. In addition, the change of the adsorption ratio of each antigen is monitored by controlling the contents of the adsorbent and other components. Each sample which has a less change in the adsorption ratio is immunized into small animals to compare the level of the antibody formation. A proper combining method was selected by reviewing the result of antibody fomnation in small animals.<br>
In addition, as a result of the review with respect to the adsorbents of the currently commercial DTP vaccine and the hepatitis B vaccine, aluminum hydroxide gel; and aluminum phosphate gel were mainly used. It is known that the adsorption of the protein to each aluminum gel is caused by a surface electric charge of each protein and a gel component. And it is also known that the aluminum hydroxide gel has a positive surface electric charge in a physiological pH range, and aluminum phosphate gel has a negative surface electric charge ("Vaccine Design -The subunit and adjuvant approach", ed. By M.F. Powell &amp; M.J. Newman, 1995, p229-239). In the case that the above two types of aluminum gels are concurrently used, a certain interaction occurs, so that the size of particle in the solution may be increased, and the adsorption capacity to protein may be decreased. In addition, the surface electric charge of each component antigen of the hepatitis 8 vaccine and combined vaccine has generally a negative surface electric charge in a physiological pH range. Therefore, the aluminum hydroxide gel is pnDper as an adsorbent.<br>
In the conventional art, the component of the adsorbent such as the aluminum hydroxide gel and aluminum phosphate gel was co-used (International Publication No. WO 93/24148) but based on the above reason, the inventors of the present invention judged that the adsorbent of the combined vaccine should have the same salt type and the aluminum hydroxide gel which is used as an adsorbent is an important factor for obtaining a certain adsorption ratio of each component antigen.<br>
But it is evident that the adsorbent covers not only the aluminum hydroxide gel but also its equivalents in the present invention.<br><br>
In addition, in the combined vaccine prepared by the present invention, other component antigens except hepatitis B antigen include proteins as a main component, while, in the case of the hepatitis B vaccine, the antigen exists generally in a particle type which includes a phospholipid layer. Therefore, it is preferred that when manufacturing the hepatitis B vaccine for a combined vaccine prepared by the present invention, in order to decrease a certain interference by other antigens with respect to the phospholipid component of the hepatitis B vaccine antigen which includes a phospholipid layer, a neutral surfactant such as Polysorbate 20 (Tween 20). Polysorbate 80 (Tween 80) and Triton X-100 are added.<br>
Since the titer of the hepatitis B vaccine tends to decrease in the case that the amount of the neutral surfactant is high, it is preferred that the neutral surfactant is added at the mass ratio below 50% with respect to protein amount of the hepatitis B surface antigen but the above amount is not limited thereto.<br>
In the present invention, Corynebacterium diphtheria, PW No. 8 as an antigen of the diphtheria is prepared and cultivated in a proper culture medium. The diphtheria toxoid is preferred, which is obtained by detoxifying the ■ diphtheria toxin which is purified by a conventional method. The amount of the antigen is preferably 10--25 Lf based on the pediatric dose. As a tetanus antigen, Clostridium tetanii. Harvard, is cultivated in a proper culture medium under anaerobic condition. The tetanus toxoid which is obtained by detoxifying the tetanus toxin purified by the conventional method is proper. The amount of the antigen is preferably I'-SLf based on the pediatric dose. In addition, the Pertussis antigen is cultivated in a proper culture medium using Bordetella pertussis, Tohama phase I, and multiple kinds of antigen protein including a Pertussis toxoid are purified by a conventional method in a culture supernatant and detoxified. Purified Pertussis antigens or a whole cell Pertussis antigen is proper. Here, the manufacturing method of a combined vaccine is provided in which in the case of the multiple kinds of antigens, the total amount of the antigens is below 20|igPN based on the pediatric dose, and in the case of the<br><br>
whole cell Pertussis antigen, the amount of the antigen is preferably below 20 OE based on the pediatric dose. The present invention is further directed to a method for manufacturing a combined vaccine in which purified multiple antigen proteins include a detoxified Pertussis toxoid and filamentous hemagglutinin (FHA) antigen.<br>
Preferably, the present invention is directed to a method for manufacturing a combined vaccine in such a manner that the amount of recombinant hepatitis B virus surface antigen, which manufactured by a genetic engineering method as a hepatitis B antigen, is 5-1 Oug based on the pediathc dose. More preferably, the present invention is directed to a method for manufacturing in such a manner that the hepatitis B surface antigen is adsorbed to an adsorbent by mixing with stirring at 2-8°C for 3-^20 hours. In order to find the optimum content of adsortDant for manufacturing of the combined vaccine, the adsorption ratio for each antigen component was analyzed at each concentration of adsortDant. As a result, when the final aluminum ion concentration is below 0.5mg/ml at the time when the final combination is completed, the adsorption ratio of each antigen was relatively decreased (as shown in Fig. 1). In addition, the aluminum ion concentration is stipulated to be under 1.25mg/ml in the aluminum gel used for the vaccine by regulation (WHO, "Requirements for diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis and combined vaccines" in Technical Report Series No. 800, 1990, p87-179). Therefore, as the aluminum hydroxide gel, the concentration of the final aluminum ion is preferably in the range of 0.5'-1.25mg/ml and more preferably in the range of 0.7mg/ml.<br>
In addition, in order to prevent a possibility that the absorption ratio of each component antigen is decreased by a repulsive -force caused among each component antigenr even after the combination of each component is completed, the antigenicity and the level of antibody formation of each component antigen are converted to the relative percentage to compare those values between two samples: a sample that the other component except an<br><br>
aluminum hydroxide gel is previously combined and then suplus aluminum hydroxide gel is additionally added and a sample that the adsorbent of the same concentration is previously added before the combination is completed. The change of the antigenicity and the level of antibody formation decreases when the surplus adsorbant is added even after the combination of each component is completed (as shown in Fig. 2).<br>
In addition, in the case of the sample in which the polysorbate SO 80 (tween 80) is added, the antigenicity and titer with respect to the hepatitis B were maintained (as shown in Fig. 2). It is expected that a similar result i© may be obtained even when neutral surfactants such as polysorbate 20 and triton X-100 are used whithin proper concentration. As shown in Fig. 2. the sample 1 and sample 2 are prepared in the way of that surplus aluminum hydroxide gel is additionally added after the combination of each component is completed, and that the adsorbent of the same concentration is previously added before the combination is completedr, respectively.<br>
Preferably, the present invention is directed to a method for manufacturing a combined vaccine in which the aluminum ion concentration of the.aluminum hydroxide gel is in the range of 0.5'-1.25mg/ml. More preferably, the present invention is directed to a method for manufacturing a combined vaccine which includes a step of adding surplus adsorbent in the range that does not exceed the concentration range of the aluminum ion of 0,5-1.25 mg/ml after protective antigens adsorbed to the adsorbent are combined. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, it is possible to maintain an inherent adsorption of each component antigen in the combined vaccine and to increase an immunity.<br>
As the Pertussis antigen, a purified Pertussis antigen is generally used in Korea and several other countries. Since some American countries and the third world countries use the-a whole cell Pertussis antigen which is detoxified. Therefore, in the present invention, the applicable range of the combined vaccine is widened by the study on the combining method using whole cell<br><br>
pertussis antigen. In this case, the combining was performed in the same method as using the mentioned purified Pertussis antigen for thereby obtaining a sample capable of maintaining an immunity of each component(as shown in Table 1).<br>
In the case of the DTP vaccine which includes a whole cell Pertussis antigen, a aluminum phosphate gel is generally used as an adsorbent. However, in order to manufacture a combined vaccine with respect to the hepatitis B antigen, the DTP vaccine was manufactured using the aluminum hydroxide gel. In this case, the immunity with respect to the Pertussis was decreased, but when a surplus aluminum hydroxide gel was additionally added after the combination of each component vaccine was completed (sample A), it was possible to maintain a desired immunity. As a reference, the sample B is prepared in the way of that the adsorbent of the same concentration was previously added before the combination was completed.<br>
The safety and efficacy of the combined vaccine manufactured according to the present invention was proved based on the following methods. First, overdosage of combined vaccine was administrated to a rodent, and it was checked that a lesion was not observed as a result of the biopsy (The result of the same is not provided). In addition, the antibody level against each antigen was measured in a group (group 2) in which a combined vaccine was administrated to a monkey and in a group (group 1) in which each vaccine of DTP and hepatitis B was concurrently administrated. As a result of the t-test with respect to the antibody amount between two groups, when comparing the result of the group 2 with the result of the group 1, it was evaluated that the combined vaccine showed the equal or better immunogenecity against each antigen to concurrently injection group of each vaccine (as shown in Fig. 3. The result of the statistic is not provided).<br>
In conclusion, the combining method was developed in the present invention, which an interaction among different immune components was minimized, and each immunogenic effect did not decrease. When dividing each<br><br>
immune component used for the combined vaccine based on physical and chemical properties, the immunogenic components may be divided into a protein antigen (diphtheria antigen, tetanus antigen, purified Pertussis antigen), an antigen composed of protein and phospholipid layer (hepatitis B antigen), and an antigen composed of killed whole cell (a whole cell Pertussis antigen), etc. Therefore, it may be predicted that a combination with other antigen of single vaccine may be implemented based on the physical and chemical characteristics of components. A combination of an additional vaccine may be possible with respect to the diseases (hemophilus influenza, polio), which should be prevented in the infants by the combined vaccines prepared according to the present invention.<br>
The body vaccination period of the combined vaccine agent according to the present invention may be the previous vaccination periods of the DTP vaccine or the hepatitis B vaccine. In the case that there is the hepatitis B antigen in the mother's body, it is preferred to inoculate three times of second, fourth and sixth months. In the case that there is not the hepatitis B in the mother's body, as a proper vaccination period, the hepatitis B vaccine is singularly inoculated after birth, and then the additional vaccination is performed using a combined vaccine. A proper vaccination with respect to the infants can be perfonned by a muscle or hypodennic injection method. The doze of the antigen of diphtheria, tetanus, Pertussis and hepatitis B respectively in the combined vaccine according to the present invention is the same as the doze for the infant of the antigen of each single vaccine.<br>
Example 1<br>
Manufacture of hepatitis B antigen<br>
The yeast cell which is capable of expressing the hepatitis B surface antigen by genetic engineering method is intensively cultivated. 1kg of the precipitate of yeast cells which is obtained by the centrifugation is diluted at a ratio of 1:2 in a buffer solution (0.5M NaCI, lOmM EDTA, 0.01% Thimerosal,<br><br>
0.1M Phosphate. pH 7.0). The diluted solution flows through a glass bead beator (or Dynomil) for thereby breaking cell walls and so on. The obtained solution is added with a neutral surfactant (Tween group or Triton group) by 0.5% and is unifonmly nnixed by stirring at 4°C. Sodium hydroxide was added to the resultant solution for thereby obtaining pH 11 and is then mixed by stirring at 4°C for 5 hours. A diluted hydrochloric acid was added to the resultant solution for thereby obtaining pH 4. The precipitate was removed by a centrifugation at 6000rpm for 15 minutes using the centrifugal machine (ROTOR: JA-14, Beckman Inc. USA), and the upper solution Including the hepatitis B surface antigen was obtained. The pH of the upper solution was made at 7, and then silica was added thereto and was mixed at 4-25°C for 3^-16 hours, so that the hepatitis B surface antigen was adsorbed to the silica. The silica gel which is preferably used in the present invention is Aerosil 380(Degussa, USA) which includes fine hydration silica or anhydrous silica having a valid surface area of 100-"500mm^/g. In order to remove contaminants from the silica to which the hepatitis B surface antigen is adsorbed, the resultant solution was washed two times using sodium phosphate - sodium chloride buffer solution of pH 7. The washed silica was contacted in the sodium carbonate buffer solution of pH 9.6 for about 2 hours for thereby desorption of a surface antigen. The thus separated surface antigen had a protein purity of above 90% in the solution. The resultant solution^ was flown in the DEAE-Sepharose (PHAMACIA, Sweden) which was balanced using the said sodium buffer solution for thereby specifically attaching a surface antigen and removing the substances separated in the column using the said buffer solution. Contaminants slightly attached on the column was eluted using the buffer solution including sodium chloride of 0.05-0.1 M. Thereafter, the hepatitis B surface antigen was eluted using the said buffer solution including the sodium chloride of 0.2M. The thus eluted solution was concentrated using a ultrafiltration membrane which is capable of separating the substance of molecular weight above than 100,000. and the precipitate was separated by<br><br>
centrifugation and removed, and the upper solution was collected, and the gel permeation chromatography (Sepharose CL-4B, PHAMACIA, Sweden) was perfomied with respect to the collected upper solution. The fractions which included a pure surface antigen were confirmed by electrophorsis and were used as the hepatitis B antigen. In addition, in order to decrease an interaction with each of the hepatitis surface antigen, the tween 80 was added to 0, 5, 10|ig per 1ml, and then the effect of tween 80 was observed (as shown in Fig.<br>
2).<br>
Example 2<br>
Manufacture of diphtheria toxoid<br>
The corynebacterium diphtheria PW No. 8 was cultured at 35°C for 24 hours in the nutrition agar culture medium (DIFCO. USA) and was subcultured two times. One of the colony was cultured at 35°C for 24 hours in 2ml of the brain heart infusion culture medium (DIFCO, USA), and 1.2ml of it was inoculated to the modified Muller culture medium (refer to: Stainer, et. al, Canadian J, Microbiol.. 14:155, 1968) of 300ml and was cultured at 35°C for 36 hours. After the culture, cells were removed from the culturing solution, and the toxin solution was collected and it was added with ammonium sulfate at 4°C. The final concentration was made in 25(w/v)%. and pH was made in 8.0. The culturing solution having adjusted pH and concentration' of salt was dropped into the phenyl-sepharose column which was previously balanced using lOmM tris buffer solution pH 8.0 including 25(w/v)% ammonium sulfate. The buffer solution same as the column balance solution and lOmM tris buffer solution(pH 8.0) including 15(w/v)% ammonium sulfate were sequentially flown to the column for thereby removing impurities. The toxin was eluted using 10mM tris buffer solution(pH 8.0) which did not include salt. The eluted diphtheria toxin solution was collected and was dialyzed to lOmM phosphate buffer solution(pH 7.4) including sodium chloride of 150mM. After the dialyzing process was completed, fonnalin was added, so that the final concentration was 0.05(w/v)%,<br><br>
