TARGETED BINDING AGENTS DIRECTED TO PDGFR-ALPHA AND USES<br>
THEREOF<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Cross Reference to Related Applications<br>
|001j This application claims priority under 35 U.S.C. § 119 to U.S. Provisional Application Serial No. 60/835,647, filed August 3, 2006, the entirety of which is hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
[002] The invention relates to targeted binding agents against the largci antigen PDGFR-alpha and uses of such agents. In some embodiments, the invention relates lo fully human monoclonal antibodies directed to PDGFR-alpha and uses of these antibodies. Aspects of the invention also relate to hybridomas or other cell lines expressing such targeted binding agents or antibodies. The described targeted binding agents and antibodies are useful as diagnostics and for the treatment of diseases associated with the activity and/or overexpression of PDGFR-alpha.<br>
Description of the Related Art<br>
[003} Platelet derived growth factor (PDGF) is a protein that regulates cell growth and division. There are five different isoforms of PDGF (A, B. C. D, and an AB helerodimer) that exist as dimers and activate the cellular response through two different receptors (PDGFR-alpha and PDGFR-beta). Specifically, PDGF dimers bind lo two receptors simultaneously to induce receptor dimerization, autophosphorylation and intracellular signaling.<br>
|004] Platelet derived growth factor receptor-alpha (PDGFR-alpha, also known as CDJ40a.) is a type HI receptor tyrosine kinase characterized by an extracellular domain having Five lgG-like domains, a transmembrane domain and a catalytic intracellular domain. PDGFR-alpha can form homodimers or heterodimers with the structurally similar PDGFR-beta.    PDGF-AA activates only alpha-alpha receptor dimers, PDGF-AB and PDGF-CC<br><br><br>
WO 2008/112003<br><br>
PCT/US2007/075117<br><br>
activate alpha-alpha and/or alpha-beta receptor diniers and PDGF-BB activates ail three combinations of receptor dimers.<br>
J005] PDGFR-alpha has been linked to tumorigenesis and has been implicated in a number of cancers including breast, lung, ovarian, prostate, colon and endometrial cancers. as well as hepatocellular carcinoma, glioblastoma, melanoma, and gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST)).<br>
J006] Several companies have developed therapeutic agents that target PDGFR-alpha. Gleevec® (Novartis®) and SUTENT/SU1124S (sunitinib malate, Pfizer®) are small molecule drugs that target PDGFR-alpha as well as other receptor tyrosine kinases. In addition, monoclonal antibodies that target PDGFR-alpha have been reported. International publication number WO 1992/013867 describes that mouse or rabbit monoclonal and/or polyclonal antibodies may be prepared to PDGF receptor constructs. international publication number WO 1995/000659 relates to a monoclonal antibody, specific for PDGFR-alpha, characterized in that it binds PDGFR-alpha and does not bind PDGFR-beta. The application discloses two antibodies; characterized as having half maximal binding affinity oi~ 50pM and 75pM as measured by solid phase enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. International publication number WO2006/138729 discloses a fully human monoclonal antibody, tenned 3G3 (ImClone Systems, Inc.), that targets PDGFR-alpha. This antibody has" a reported affinity for soluble PDGFR-alpha of 40 pM as measured in a bivalent affinity assay; in which soluble PDGFR-alpha was immobilized on a sensor chip and antibody was injected at various concentrations. As discussed herein, in a bivalent assay, experimental artefacts may affect the measured affinity.<br>
[0071 An antibody with an affinity higher than 40 pM, may be desirable as such an antibody may produce a greater extent and/or duration of PDGFR-alpha inhibition when administered to humans at standard doses. An antibody with an affinity higher than 40pM may be administered at a lower effective dose than an antibody with a lower affninity, or may be administered at longer dosing intervals in comparison with a standard dosing interval for an antibody with a lower affinity.<br>

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[008] Embodiments of the invention relate to targeted binding agents that specifically bind to PDGFR-alpha and inhibit the growth of cells that express PDGFR-alpha. Mechanisms by which this can be achieved can include, and are not limited to, blocking ligand binding and/or inhibiting cell signaling implicated in tumor cell growth as weil as inhibition of the stromal fibroblast component leading to reduced angiogenesis. The targeted binding agents are useful for reducing tumour growth and angiogenesis.<br>
[009] In one embodiment of the invention, the targeted binding agent is a fully human antibody that binds to PDGFR-alpha and inhibits binding of PDGF-AA, PDGF-AB. PDGF-BB, and/or PDGF-CC ligands to PDGFR-alpha. Yet another embodiment of the invention is a fully human monoclonal antibody that binds to PDGFR-alpha and inhibits receptor autophosphorylation. Another embodiment of the invention is a fully human monoclonal antibody that binds to PDGFR-alpha and inhibits downstream cell signaling implicated in cell growth.<br>
(0010J In some embodiments, the targeted binding agent binds to PDGFR-alpha and does not cross-react with PDGFR-beta receptor, that is, the agent is mono-specific. In some embodiments, the targeted binding agent binds to PDGFR-alpha and docs not cross react with other Class III receptor tyrosine kinase family members, such as. for example, FLT3. c-kit, and/or CSF-1R.<br>
J0011] Another embodiment of the invention is a targeted binding agent that competes for binding with any of the targeted binding agents or antibodies described herein.<br>
|0012] In one embodiment, the targeted binding agent binds PDGFR-alpha with a KD of less than about 500 picomolar (pM). In another embodiment, the targeted binding agent binds with a KD less than about 400, 300, 200 or 100 pM. In one embodiment, the targeted binding agent binds with a KD of less than about 75, 60, 50: 40, 30, 20, 10 or 5 pM. Affinity and/or avidity measurements can be measured by FMAT, FACS, KinExA® and/or BIACORE®, as described herein.<br>
|00131 In another embodiment, the targeted binding agent binds PDGFR-alpha with a KD less than about 400, 300, 200, or 100, 75, 60, 50, 40, 30. 20, 10, or 5 pM as measured in a monovalent affinity assay. Monovalent affinity may be measured in a BIACORE® assay in which soluble receptor is flowed over immobilized antibody.    In comparison with a<br><br>
WO 2008/112003<br><br>
PCT/US2007/0751I7<br><br>
bivalent affinity assay, the KD as reported by a monovalent affinity assay is much less likely to be affected by experimental artefacts and is thus able to report a KD much closer lo the true monovalent affinity of the antibody. In a bivalent affinity assay, the density of immobilized receptor influences the extent to which single antibody molecules bind twice and/or rebind immobilized receptor as they are flowed over. As such, in a bivalent affinity assay, the density of receptor can directly affect the reported KD. Thus, a monovalent affinity assay provides a much more biologically-relevant measurement of affinity.<br>
|00141 In another embodiment, the targeted binding agent inhibits ligand-induced transphosphorylation within the receptor dimer with an IC50 less than about 400, 300. 200, or 100, 75, 60, 50, 40, 30, 20, 10, or 5 pM when performed at close to saturating ligand levels.<br>
|0015| In another embodiment, the targeted binding agent inhibits ligand-induced receptor autophosphorylation with an IC50 less than about 400, 300, 200, 100, 75, 60, 50. 40. 30, 20, 10 or 5 pM when performed at close to saturating ligand levels.<br>
|0016] In one embodiment of the invention, the targeted binding agent is an antibody. In one embodiment of the invention, the targeted binding agent is a monoclonal antibody. In one embodiment of the invention, the targeted binding agent is a fully human monoclonal antibody. In another embodiment of the invention, the targeted binding agent is a fully human monoclonal antibody of the IgGl, IgG2, IgG3 or IgG4 isotype. In another embodiment of the invention, the targeted binding agent is a fully human monoclonal antibody of the IgG2 isotype. This isotype has reduced potential to elicit effector function in comparison with other isotypes, which may lead lo reduced toxicity.<br>

100401 Monoclonal antibodies 2.175.3 and 2.449.1.3 are both high affinity antibodies to PDGFRa, and block PDGF-driven cellular responses with high potency in vitro. Although these two antibodies share VH (VH3-11) and Vk (012) usage, they diverge in D, JH and Jk usage. Thus, they are derived from different B-cell lineages. They do, however, share unusual sequence patterns in Vk. Residue 25 is a proline in both antibodies, mutated from the germline alanine. Proline is not used by any of the Vk germline genes, and occurs at this location in only 0.2% of human sequences in the Kabat database. Proline at position 25 would insert a rigid peptide bond and a sharp angle in the peptide backbone, and would therefore produce unique structural characteristics wiihin this Vk region of the lisjhi chain of both of these antibodies. Similarly, a mutant arginine is used by both 2.175.3 and 2.449.1.3 in position 27e (Kabat numbering) of CDR1 of Vk. Arginine is not used in this canonical location in any Vk germline genes, and occurs in only 0.4% of human sequences in the Kabat database.

[0089] As utilized in accordance with the present disclosure, the following terms, unless otherwise indicated, shall be understood to have the following meanings:<br>
|0090] A compound refers to any small molecular weight compound with a molecular weight of less than about 2000 Daitons.<br>
(0091] The term "'PDGFR-alpha" refers to the platelet derived growth factor tyrosine kinase receptor-alpha encoded by the PDGFR-alpha gene. PDGFR-alpha is also known as CD140aandPDGFR-a.<br>
[0092] The term "neutralizing" when referring to a targeted binding agent such as an antibody relates to the ability of said agent to eliminate, or significantly reduce, the activity of a target antigen. Accordingly, a "neutralizing" anti-PDGFR-alpha antibody of the invention is capable of eliminating or significantly reducing the activity of PDGFR-alpha. A neutralizing PDGFR-alpha antibody may, for example, act by blocking the binding of ligand to its receptor PDGFR-alpha.<br>
[0093] The term "isolated polynucleotide" as used herein shall mean a polynucleotide that has been isolated from its naturally occurring environment. Such polynucleotides may be genomic, cDNA, or synthetic. Isolated polynucleotides preferably are not associated with all or a portion of the polynucleotides they associate with in nature. The isolated polynucleotides may be operably linked to another polynucleotide that it is not linked to in nature. In addition, isolated polynucleotides preferably do not occur in nature as part of a larger sequence.<br>
[0094J The term "isolated protein"' referred to herein means a protein that has been isolated from its naturally occurring environment. Such proteins may be derived from genomic DNA, cDNA, recombinant DNA, recombinant RNA, or synthetic origin or some combination thereof, which by virtue of its origin, or source of derivation, the "isolated protein" (1) is not associated with proteins found in nature, (2) is free of other proteins from the same source, e.g. free of murine proteins, (3) is expressed by a cell from a different species, or (4) does not occur in nature.<br>
[0095] The term "'polypeptide" is used herein as a generic term to refer to native protein, fragments, or analogs of a polypeptide sequence. Hence, native protein, fragments, and analogs are species of the polypeptide genus. Preferred polypeptides in accordance with the invention comprise the human heavy chain immunoglobulin molecules and the human<br><br><br>

PCT/US2007/075117<br><br>
kappa light chain immunoglobulin molecules, as well as antibody molecules formed by combinations comprising the heavy chain immunoglobulin molecules with light chain immunoglobulin molecules, such as the kappa or lambda light chain immunoglobulin molecules, and vice versa, as well as fragments and analogs thereof. Preferred polypeptides in accordance with the invention may also comprise solely the human heavy chain immunoglobulin molecules or fragments thereof.<br>
[0096] The term "naturally-occurring" as used herein as applied to an object refers to the fact that an object can be found in nature. - For example, a polypeptide or polynucleotide sequence that is present in an organism (including viruses) that can be isolated from a source in nature and which has not been intentionally modified by man in the laboratory or otherwise is naturally-occurring.<br>
|0097| The term "operably linked" as used herein refers to positions of components so described that are in a relationship permitting them to function in their intended manner. For example, a control sequence "operably linked" to a coding sequence is connected in such a way that expression of the coding sequence is achieved under conditions compatible vith the control sequences.<br>
|0098] The term "control sequence" as used herein refers to polynucleotide sequences that are necessary either to effect or to affect the expression and processing of coding sequences to which they are connected. The nature of such control sequences differs depending upon the host organism; in prokaryotes, such control sequences generally include promoter, ribosomal binding site, and transcription termination sequence; in eukaryotes, generally, such control sequences may include promoters, enhancers, introns, transcription termination sequences, polyadenylation signal sequences, and 5' and '3 untranslated regions. The term "control sequences" is intended to include, at a minimum, all components whose presence is essential for expression and processing, and can also include additional components whose presence is advantageous, for example, leader sequences and fusion partner sequences.<br>
10099] The term "polynucleotide" as referred to herein means a polymeric form of nucleotides of at least 10 bases in length, either ribonucleotides or deoxynucleotides or a modified form of either type of nucleotide, or RNA-DNA hetero-duplexes. The term includes single and double stranded forms of DNA.<br><br><br>
WO 2008/112003<br><br>
PCT/US2007/075117<br><br>
[00100] The term "oligonucleotide" referred to herein includes naturally occurring, and modified nucleotides linked together by naturally occurring, and non-naturally occurring linkages. Oligonucleotides are a polynucleotide subset generally comprising a length of 200 bases or fewer. Preferably, oligonucleotides are 10 to 60 bases in length and most preferably 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, or 20 to 40 bases in length. Oligonucleotides are usually single stranded, e.g. for probes; although oligonucleotides may be double stranded, e.g. for use in the construction of a gene mutant. Oligonucleotides can be either sense or antisense oligonucleotides.<br>
[00101] The term "naturally occurring nucleotides" referred to herein includes deoxyribonucleo tides and ribonucleotides. The term "'modified nucleotides" referred to herein includes nucleotides with modified or substituted sugar groups and the like. The term "oligonucleotide linkages" referred to herein includes oligonucleotides linkages such as phosphorothioatc, phosphorodithioate, phosphoroselenoate, phosphorodiselenoate: phosphoroanilothioate, phosphoraniiadate, phosphoroamidate, and the like. See e.g., LaPlanche et al. Nucl. Acids Res. 14:9081 (1986); Stec et al. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 106:6077 (1984); Stein et ai. Nucl. Acids Res. 16:3209 (1988); Zon et al. Anti-Cancer Drug Design 6:539 (1991); Zon et at. Oligonucleotides and Analogues: A Practical Approach, pp. 87-108 (F. Eckstein, Ed., Oxford University Press, Oxford England (1991)); Stec et al. U.S. Patent No. 5,151,510; Uhlmann and Peyman Chemical Reviews 90:543 (1990), the disclosures of which are hereby incorporated by reference. An oligonucleotide can include a label for detection, if desired.<br>
[00102] The term "selectively hybridize" referred to herein means to detectably and specifically bind. Polynucleotides, oligonucleotides and fragments thereof selectively hybridize to nucleic acid strands under hybridization and wash conditions that minimize appreciable amounts of detectable binding to nonspecific nucleic acids. High stringency conditions can be used to achieve selective hybridization conditions as known in the art and discussed herein. Generally, the nucleic acid sequence homology between the polynucleotides, oligonucleotides, or antibody fragments and a nucleic acid sequence of interest will be at least 80%, and more typically with preferably increasing homologies of at least 85%, 90%, 95%, 99%, and 100%.<br><br><br>
WO 2008/112003<br><br>
PCT/US2007/075117<br><br>
100103} The term i:CDR region" or "'CDR" is intended lo indicate the hypervariable regions of the heavy and light chains of the immunoglobulin as defined by Kabat et al. 1991 (Kabat, E.A. et al. (1991) Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, 5lh Edition. US Department of Health and Human Services, Public Service, NIK Washington), and later editions. An antibody typically contains 3 heavy chain CDRs and 3 light chain CDRs. The term CDR or CDRs is used here in order to indicate, according to the case, one of these regions or several, or even the whole, of these regions which contain the majority of the amino acid residues responsible for the binding by affinity of the antibody for the antigen or the epitope which it recognizes.<br>
[00104] The third CDR of the heavy chain (HCDR3) has a greater size variability (greater diversity essentially due to the mechanisms of arrangement of the genes which give rise to it). It may be as short as 2 amino acids although the longest size known is 26- CDR length may also vary according to the length that can be accommodated by the particular underlying framework. Functionally, HCDR3 plays a role in part in the determination of the specificity of the antibody (Segal et al., PNAS, 71:4298-4302, 1974, Am it et al., Science. 233:747-753, 1986, Chothia et al., J. Mol. Biol., 196:901-917, 1987, Chothia ct al., Nature. 342:877- 883, 1989, Caton et al., J. Immunol, 144:1965-1968, 1990. Sharon et al., PNAS, 87:4814-4817, 1990, Sharon et al., J. Immunol., 144:4863-4869, 1990, Kabat ct al., J. Immunol., 147:1709-1719, 1991).<br>
[00105] The term a ;*set of CDRs" referred to herein comprises CDR1, CDR2 and CDR3. Thus, a set of HCDRs refers to HCDRI, HCDR2 and HCDR3, and a set of LCDRs refers to LCDR1, LCDR2 and LCDR3. Unless otherwise stated, a "set of CDRs" includes HCDRs and LCDRs.<br>
{00106) Two amino acid sequences are 'homologous" if there is a partial or complete identity between their sequences. For example, 85% homology means that 85% of the amino acids are identical when the two sequences are aligned for maximum matching. Gaps (in either of the two sequences being matched) are allowed in maximizing matching; gap lengths of 5 or less are preferred with 2 or less being more preferred. Alternatively and preferably, two protein sequences (or polypeptide sequences derived from them of at least about 30 amino acids in length) are homologous, as this term is used herein, if they have an alignment score of at more than 5 (in standard deviation units) using the program ALIGN<br><br><br>
WO 2008/112003<br><br>
PCT/US2007/075117<br><br>
with the mutation data matrix and a gap penalty of 6 or greater. See Dayhoff, M.O., in Atlas of Protein Sequence and Structure, pp. 101-110 (Volume 5, National Biomedical Research Foundation (1972)) and Supplement 2 to this volume, pp. 1-10. The two sequences or pails thereof are more preferably homoJogous if their amino acids are greater than or equal to 50% identical when optimally aligned using the ALIGN program. It should be appreciated that there can be differing regions of homology within two orthologous sequences. For example, the functional sites of mouse and human orthologues may have a higher degree of homology than non-functional regions.<br>
(00107] The term "corresponds to" is used herein to mean that a polynucleotide sequence is homologous (i.e., is identical, not strictly evolutionarily related) to all or a portion of a reference polynucleotide sequence, or that a polypeptide sequence is identical to a reference polypeptide sequence.<br>
|00108j In contradistinction, the term '"complementary to" is used herein to mean that the complementary sequence is homologous to all or a portion of a reference polynucleotide sequence. For illustration, the nucleotide sequence "TATAC" corresponds to a reference sequence "TATAC" and is complementary to a reference sequence "GTATA".<br>
[00109] The term 'sequence identity" or "'identity' with reference to a sequence means that two polynucleotide or amino acid sequences are identical (i.e.. on a nucleotide-by-nucleotide or rcsidue-by-residuc basis) over the comparison window. The term "percentage of sequence identity" is calculated by comparing two optimally aligned sequences over the window of comparison, determining the number of positions at which the identical nucleic acid base (e.g., A, T, C, G, U, or I) or amino acid residue occurs in both sequences to yield the number of matched positions, dividing the number of matched positions by the total number of positions in the comparison window (i.e., the window size), and multiplying the result by 100 to yield the percentage of sequence identity. The terms "substantial identity" as used herein denotes a characteristic of a polynucleotide or amino acid sequence, wherein the polynucleotide or amino acid comprises a sequence that has at least 85 percent sequence identity, preferably at least 90 to 95 percent sequence identity, more preferably at least 99 percent sequence identity, as compared to a reference sequence over a comparison window of at least 18 nucleotide (6 amino acid) positions, frequently over a window of at least 24-48 nucleotide (8-16 amino acid) positions, wherein the percentage of<br><br>
WO 2008/112003<br><br>
PCT/US2007/075117<br><br>
sequence identity is calculated by comparing the reference sequence to the sequence which may include deletions or additions which total 20 percent or less of the reference sequence over the comparison window. The reference sequence may be a subset of a larger sequence.<br>
|001101 As used herein, the twenty conventional amino acids and their abbreviations follow conventional usage. See Immunology - A Synthesis (2nd Edition, E.S. Golub and D.R. Gren, Eds., Sinauer Associates, Sunderland, Mass. (1991)), which is incorporated herein by reference. Stereoisomers (e.g., P-amino acids) of the twenty conventional amino acids, unnatural amino acids such as a-, a-di substituted amino acids, N-alkyl amino acids, lactic acid, and other unconventional arAino acids may also be suitable components for polypeptides of the present invention. Examples of unconventional amino acids include: 4-hydroxyproline, y-carboxyglutamate, c-N,N,N-trimethyilysine, e-N-aceiyllysine. O-phosphoserine. N-acetylserine. N-formylm£thionine. 3-melhylhisiidine. 5-hydroxylysine, a-N-methylarginine, and other similar aminc&gt; acids and imino acids (e.g.. 4-hydroxyproline). In the polypeptide notation used herein, the left-hand direction is the amino terminal direction and the right-hand direction is the carboxy-terminal direction, in accordance with standard usage and convention.<br>
|00111| Similarly, unless specified otherwise, the left-hand end of single-stranded polynucleotide sequences is the 5' end; the left-hand direction of double-stranded polynucleotide sequences is referred to as the 5' direction. The direction of 5' to 3' addition of nascent RNA transcripts is referred to as the transcription direction; sequence regions on the DNA strand having the same sequence as the RNA and which are 5' to the 5' end of the RNA transcript are referred to as 'upstream sequences"; sequence regions on the DNA strand having the same sequence as the RNA and which are 3' to the 3' end of the RNA transcript are referred to as ^downstream sequences1'.<br>
[00112] As applied to polypeptides, the term "substantial identity" means that two peptide sequences, when optimally aligned, such as by the programs GAP or BESTFIT using default gap weights, share at least 80 percent sequence identity, preferably at least 90 percent sequence identity, more preferably at least 95 percent sequence identity, and most preferably at least 99 percent sequence identity. Preferably, residue positions that are not identical differ by conservative amino acid substitutions. Conservative amino acid substitutions refer to the interchangeability of residues having similar side chains.   For example, a group of<br><br>
WO 2008/112003<br><br>
PCT/US2007/075117<br><br>
amino acids having aliphatic side chains is glycine, alanine, valine, leucine, and isoleucine; a group of amino acids having aliphatic-hydroxy 1 side chains is serine and threonine; a group of amino acids having amide-containing side chains is asparagine and glutamine; a group of amino acids having aromatic side chains is phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan; a group of amino acids having basic side chains is lysine, arginine, and histidine; and a group of amino acids having sulfur-containing side chains is cysteine and methionine. Preferred conservative amino acids substitution groups are: valine-leucine-isoleucine, phenylalanine-tyrosine, lysine-arginine, alanine-valine, glutamic-aspartic, and asparagine-glutamine.<br>
[00113| As discussed herein, minor variations in the amino acid sequences of antibodies or immunoglobulin molecules are contemplated as being encompassed by the present invention, providing that the variations in the amino acid sequence maintain at least 75%, more preferably at least 80%. 90%; 95%, and most preferably 99% sequence identity to the antibodies or immunoglobulin molecules described herein. In particular, conservative amino acid replacements are contemplated. Conservative replacements are those that take place within a family of amino acids that have related side chains. Genetically encoded amino acids are generally divided into families: (1) acidic=aspartate, glutamate; (2) basic=lysine, arginine, histidine; (3) non-polar=alanine, valine, leucine, isoleucine, proline, phenylalanine, methionine, tryptophan; and (4) uncharged polar=glycine, asparagine, glutamine, cysteine, serine, threonine, tyrosine. More preferred families are: serine and threonine are an aliphatic-hydroxy family; asparagine and glutamine are an amide-containing family; alanine, valine, leucine and isoleucine are an aliphatic family; and phenylalanine, tryptophan, and tyrosine are an aromatic family. For example, it is reasonable to expect that an isolated replacement of a leucine with an isoleucine or valine, an aspartate with a glutamate, a threonine with a serine, or a similar replacement of an amino acid with a structurally related amino acid will not have a major effect on the binding function or properties of the resulting molecule, especially if the replacement does not involve an amino acid within a framework site. Whether an amino acid change results in a functional peptide can readily be determined by assaying the specific activity of the polypeptide derivative. Assays are described in detail herein. Fragments or analogs of antibodies or immunoglobulin molecules can be readily prepared by those of ordinary skill in the art. Preferred amino- and carboxy-termini of fragments or analogs occur near boundaries of functional domains.<br><br><br>
WO 2008/112003<br><br>
PCIYUS2007/075117<br><br>
Structural and functional domains can be identified by comparison of the nucleotide and/or amino acid sequence data to public or proprietary sequencee databases. Preferably, computerized comparison methods are used to identify sequence motifs or predicted protein conformation domains that occur in other proteins of known structure and/or function. Methods to identify protein sequences that fold into a known three-dimensional structure are known. Bowie et al. Science 253:164 (1991). Thus, the foregoing examples demonstrate lhal those of skill in the art can recognize sequence motifs a.nd structural conformations that may be used to define structural and functional domains in accordance with the antibodies described herein.<br>
|001141 Preferred amino acid substitutions a.re those which: (1) reduce susceptibility to proteolysis, (2) reduce susceptibility to oxidation. (3) alter binding affinity for forming protein complexes. (4) alter binding affinities, and (4) confer or modify other physicochemical or functional properties of such analogs, Analogs can include various muteins of a sequence other than the naturally-occurring peptide sequence. For example, single or multiple amino acid substitutions (preferably conservative amino acid substitutions) may be made in the naturally-occurring sequence (preferably in the portion of the polypeptide outside the domain(s) forming intermolecular Contacts. A consen'ative amino acid substitution should not substantially change the structural characteristics of the parent sequence (e.g., a replacement amino acid should not tend tQ break a helix that occurs in the parent sequence, or disrupt other types of secondary structure that characterizes the parent sequence). Examples of art-recognized polypeptide seminary and tertiary structures are described in Proteins, Structures and Molecular Principles fCreinhlon. Ed,, W. H. Freeman and Company, New York (1984)); Introduction to Proteih Structure (C. Branden and J. Tooze, eds.. Garland Publishing, New York, N.Y. (1991)); and Thornton el at. Nature 354:105 (1991), which are each incorporated herein by reference.<br>
[001151 Variants of the VH and VL domains and CDRs of the present invention, -including those for which *mino acid sequences are set out herein, and which can be employed in targeting agents and antibodies for PDGFR-alpjha can be obtained by means of methods of sequence alteration or mutation and screening for antigen targeting with desired characteristics. Examples of desired characteristics include but are not limited to: increased binding affinity for antigen relative to known antibodies which are specific for the antigen;<br><br><br>
WO 2008/112003<br><br>
PCT/US2007/075117<br><br>
increased neutralization of an antigen activity relative to known antibodies which are specific for the antigen if the activity is known; specified competitive ability with a known antibody or ligand to the antigen at a specific molar ratio; ability to immunoprecipitalc ligand-receptor complex; ability to bind to a specified epitope; linear epitope, e.g. peptide sequence identified using peptide-binding scan, e.g. using peptides screened in linear and/or constrained conformation; conformational epitope, formed by non-continuous residues; ability to modulate a new biological activity of PDGFR-alpha, or downstream molecule; ability to bind and/or neutralize and/or for any other desired property.<br>
(00116] The techniques required to make substitutions within amino acid sequences of CDRs. antibody VH or VL domains and antigen binding sites are available in the art. Variants of antibody molecules disclosed herein may be produced and used in the present invention. Following the lead of computational chemistry in applying multivariate data analysis techniques to the . structure/prop erty-activity relationships (Wold, et al. Multivariate data analysis in chemistry. Chemometrics -Mathematics and Statistics in Chemistry (Ed.: B. Kowalski), D. Reidel Publishing Company, Dordrecht, Holland, 1984) quantitative activity-property relationships of antibodies can be derived using well-known mathematical techniques, such as statistical regression, pattern recognition and classification (Norman et ai. Applied Regression Analysis. Wiley-Intcrscience; 3rd edition (April 1998); Kandel, Abraham &amp; Backer, Eric. Computer-Assisted Reasoning in Cluster Analysis. Prentice Hall PTR, (May II, 1995); Krzanowski, Wojtek. Principles of Multivariate Analysis: A User's Perspective (Oxford Statistical Science Series, No 22 (Paper)). Oxford University Press; (December 2000); Witten, Ian H. &amp; Frank, Eibe. Data Mining: Practical Machine Learning Tools and Techniques with Java Implementations. Morgan Kaufmann; (October 11, 1999);Denison David G. T. (Editor), Christopher C. Holmes, Bani K. Mallick, Adrian F. M. Smith.

Combinatorial Library Design and Evaluation Principles, Software, Tools, and Applications in Drug Discovery). The properties of antibodies can be derived from empirical and theoretical models (for example, analysis of likely contact residues or calculated physicochemical property) of antibody sequence, functional and three-dimensional structures and these properties can be considered singly and in combination.<br><br><br>
WO 2008/112003<br><br>
PCT/US2007/075117<br><br>
[00117) An antibody antigen-binding site composed of a VH domain and a VL domain is typically formed by six loops of polypeptide: three from the light chain variable domain (VL) and three from the heavy chain variable domain (VH). Analysis of antibodies of known atomic structure has elucidated relationships between the sequence and three-dimensional structure of antibody combining sites. These relationships imply that, except for the third region (loop) in VH domains, binding site loops have one of a small number of main-chain conformations: canonical structures. The canonical structure formed in a particular loop has been shown to be determined by its size and the presence of certain residues at key sites in both the loop and in framework regions.<br>
[001181 This study of sequence-structure relationship can be used for prediction of those residues in an antibody of known sequence, but of an unknown three-dimensional structure, which are important in maintaining the three-dimensional structure of its CDR loops and hence maintain binding specificity. These predictions can be backed up by comparison of the predictions to the output from lead optimization experiments. In a structural approach, a model can be created of the antibody molecule using any freely available or commercial package, such as WAM. A protein visualisation and analysis software package, such as Insight II (Accelrys, Inc.) or Deep View may then be used to evaluate possible substitutions at each position in the CDR. This information may then be used to make substitutions likely to have a minimal or beneficial effect on activity or confer other desirable properties.<br>
(00119| The term "polypeptide fragment" as used herein refers to a polypeptide that has an ammo-terminal and/or carboxy-terminal deletion, but where the remaining amino acid sequence is identical to the corresponding positions in the naturally-occurring sequence deduced, for example, from a full-length cDNA sequence. Fragments typically are at least 5. 6, 8 or 10 amino acids long, preferably at least 14 amino acids long, more preferably at least 20 amino acids long, usually at least 50 amino acids long, and even more preferably at least 70 amino acids long. The term "analog" as used herein refers to polypeptides which are comprised of a segment of at least 25 amino acids that has substantial identity to a portion of a deduced amino acid sequence and which has at least one of the following properties: (1) specific binding to a PDGFR-aipha, under suitable binding conditions, (2) ability to inhibit binding of PDGF-AA, (3) ability to inhibit binding of PDGF-AB, (4) ability to inhibit<br><br><br>
WO 2008/112003<br><br>
PCT/US2007/075117<br><br>
binding of PDGF-BB, and/or (5) ability to inhibit binding of PDGF-CC. Typically, polypeptide analogs comprise a conservative amino acid substitution (or addition or deletion) with respect to the naturally-occurring sequence. Analogs typically are at least 20 amino acids long, preferably at least 50 amino acids long or longer, and can often be as long as a full-length naturally-occurring polypeptide.<br>
|00120] Peptide analogs are commonly used in the pharmaceutical industry as non-peplide drugs with properties analogous to those of the template peptide. These types of non-peptide compound are termed 'peptide mimetics" or "peplidomimetics". Fauchere, J. Adv. Drug Res. 15:29 (1986); Veber and Freidinger TINS p.392 (1985); and Evans et al. J. Med. Chem. 30:1229 (1987), which are incorporated herein by reference. Such compounds are often developed with the aid of computerized molecular modeling. Peptide mimetics that are structurally similar to therapeutically useful peptides may be used to produce an equivalent therapeutic or prophylactic effect. Generally, peptidomimetics are structurally similar to a paradigm polypeptide (i.e., a polypeptide that has a biochemical property or pharmacological activity), such as human antibody, but have one or more peptide linkages optionally replaced by a linkage selected from the group consisting of: --CH2NH--, --CH2S-, -CH2-CH2-, ~ CH=CH~(cis and trans), --COCH2-, --CH(OH)CH2~, and -CH2SO--, by methods well known in the art. Systematic substitution of one or more amino acids of a consensus sequence with a D-amino acid of the same type (e.g., D-lysine in place of L-lysine) may be used to generate more stable peptides. In addition, constrained peptides comprising a consensus sequence or a substantially identical consensus sequence variation may be generated by methods known in the art (Rizo and Gierasch Ann. Rev. Biochem. 61:387 (J992), incorporated herein by reference); for example, by adding internal cysteine residues capable of forming intramolecular disulfide bridges which cyclize the peptide.<br>
[00121] As used herein, the term "antibody" refers to a polypeptide or group of polypeptides that are comprised of at least one binding domain that is formed from the folding of polypeptide chains having three-dimensional binding spaces with internal surface shapes and charge distributions complementary to the features of an antigenic determinant of an antigen. An antibody typically has a tetrameric form, Comprising two identical pairs of polypeptide chains, each pair having one '"light" and one "heavy" chain. The variable regions of each light/heavy chain pair form an antibody binding site.<br><br><br>
WO 2008/112003<br><br>
PCT/US2007/075117<br><br>
[00122) As used herein, a "targeted binding agent" is an agent, e.g. an antibody, or binding fragment thereof, that binds to a target site. In one embodiment, the targeted binding agent is specific for only one target site. In other embodiments, the targeted binding agent is specific for more than one target site. In one embodiment, the targeted binding agent may be a monoclonal antibody and the target site may be an epitope. As described below, a targeted binding agent may comprise at least one antigen binding domain (e.g. a CDR) of an antibody, wherein said domain is fused or contained within a heterologous protein scaffold, e.g. a non-antibody protein scaffold.<br>
|00123] "Binding fragments" of an antibody are produced by recombinant DNA techniques, or by enzymatic or chemical cleavage of intact antibodies. Binding fragments include Fab, Fab'. F(ab,)2, Fv, dAb and single-chain antibodies. An antibody other than a "bispecific" or "bi functional" antibody is understood to have each of its binding sites identical. An antibody substantially inhibits adhesion of a receptor to a counter-receptor when an excess of antibody reduces the quantity of receptor bound to counter-receptor by at least about 20%, 40%, 60% or 80%, and more usually greater 'han about 85% (as measured in an in vitro competitive binding assay).<br>

Nature Biotech. 14, 1239-1245, 1996). Minibodies comprising a scFv joined to a CH3 domain may also be made (Hu, S. ei al, (1996) Cancer Res., 56, 3055-3061). Other examples of binding fragments are Fab', which differs from Fab fragments by the addition of a few residues at the carboxyl terminus of the heavy chain CHI domain, including one or more cysteines from the antibody hinge region, and Fab'-SH, which is a Fab' fragment in which the cysteine residue(s) of the constant domains bear a free thiol group.<br>

[00141J 'Complement dependent cytotoxicity" and "CPC" refer to the mechanism by which antibodies carry put their cell-killing function. It is initiated by the binding of Clq, a constituent of the first component of complement, to (he Fc domain of Igs. IgG or IgM, which are in complex with antigen (Hughs-Jones, N.C., and B. Gardner. 1979. Mol. Immunol. 16:697). Clq is a large, structurally complex glycoprotein of-410 kDa present in human serum at a concentration of 70 ug/ml (Cooper, N.R. 1985. Adv. Immunol. 37:151). Together with two serine proteases, Clr and Cls, Clq forms the complex CI, the first component of complement. At least two of the N-terminal globular heads of Clq must be bound to the Fc of Igs for CI activation, hence for initiation of the complement cascade (Cooper. N.R. 1985. Adv. Immunol, 37:151).<br>
[00142] 'Whole blood assays" use unfractionated blood as a source of natural effectors. Blood contains complement in the plasma, together with FcR-expressing celjular effectors, such as polymorphonuclear cells (PMNs) and mononuclear cells (MNCs).   Thus,<br><br><br>

|00144] The term "and/or': as used herein is to be taken as specific disclosure of each of the two specified features or components with or without the other. For example "A and/or B" is to be taken as specific disclosure of each of (i) A, (ii) B and (iii) A and B, just as if each is set out individually herein.<br>
Antibody Structure<br>
|00145J The basic antibody structural unit is known to comprise a tetramer. Each tetramer is composed of two identical pairs of polypeptide chains, each pair having one "light' (about 25 kDa) and one "heavy" chain (about 50-70 kDa). The ammo-terminal portion of each chain includes a variable region of about 100 to 110 or more amino acids primarily responsible for antigen recognition. The carboxy-teiminal portion of each chain defines a constant region primarily responsible for effector function. Human light chains are classified as kappa and lambda light chains. Heavy chains are classified as mu, delta, gamma, alpha, or epsilon, and define the antibody's isotype as lgM, lgD. IgA. and igE, respectively. Within light and heavy chains, the variable and constant regions are joined by a *\J" region of about 12 or more amino acids, with the heavy chain also including a "D:' region of about 10 more amino acids. See generally, Fundamental Immunology Ch. 7 (Paul. W., ed„ 2nd ed. Raven Press, N.Y. (1989)) (incorporated by reference in its entirety for all purposes). The variable regions of each light/heavy chain pair form the antibody binding site.<br>
100146] Thus, an intact antibody has two binding sites. Except in bifunclional or bispecific antibodies, the two binding sites are the same.<br>
[00147] The chains ail exhibit the same general structure of relatively conserved framework regions (FR) joined by three hyper variable regions, also called complementarity determining regions or CDRs. The CDRs from the two chains of each pair are aligned by the framework regions, enabling binding to a specific epitope. From N-terminal to C-terminal, both light and heavy chains comprise the domains FR 1, CDR1, FR2, CDR2. FR3, CDR3 and FR4. The assignment of amino acids to each domain is in accordance with the definitions of<br><br><br>

(00148J A bispecific or bifunctional antibody is an artificial hybrid antibody having two different heavy/light chain pairs and two different binding sites. Bispecific antibodies can be produced by a variety of methods including fusion of hybridomas or linking of Fab' fragments. See, e.g., Songsivilai &amp; Lachmatm Clin. Exp. Immunol. 79: 315-321 (1990), Kostelny et al. J. Immunol. 148:1547-1553 (1992). Bispecific antibodies do not exist in the form of fragments having a single binding site (e.g., Fab, Fab', and Fv).<br>
[00149| Typically, a VH domain is paired with a VL domain to provide an antibody antigen-binding site, although a VH or VL domain alone may be used to bind antigen. The VH domain (see Table 12) may be paired with the VL domain (see Table 13). so that an antibody antigen-binding site is formed comprising both the VH and VL domains.<br>
Human Antibodies and Humanization of Antibodies<br>
[00150] Human antibodies avoid some of the problems associated with antibodies that possess murine or rat variable and/or constant regions. The presence of such murine or rat derived proteins can lead to the rapid clearance of the antibodies or can lead to the generation of an immune response against the antibody by a patient. In order to avoid the utilization of murine or rat derived antibodies, fully human antibodies can be generated through the introduction of functional human antibody loci into a rodent, other mamma! or animal so that the rodent, other mammal or animal produces fully human antibodies.<br>
[001511 One method for generating fully human antibodies is through the use of XenoMousc® strains of mice that have been engineered lo contain up to but less than 1000 kb-sized germ line configured fragments of the human hea.vy chain locus and kappa light chain locus. See Mendez et al. Nature Genetics 15:146-156 (1997) and Green and Jakobovils J. Exp. Med. 188:483-495 (1998). The XenoMouse® strains are available from Amgen, Inc. (Fremont, California, U.S.A).<br>
[001521 Such mice, then, are capable of producing human immunoglobulin molecules and antibodies and are deficient in the production of murine immunoglobulin molecules and antibodies. Technologies utilized for achieving the same are disclosed in U.S.<br><br><br>

Preparation of Antibodies<br>
[001581 I" general, antibodies produced by the fused hybridomas were human lgG2 or IgG4 heavy chains with fully human kappa or lambda light chains. Antibodies can also be of other human isotypes, including IgGl heavy chains. The antibodies possessed high affinities, typically possessing a Kd of from about 10-6 through about 10-12 M or below, when measured against cells in FACS-based affinity measurement techniques. The affinity can also be measured by solid phase and solution phase techniques. In one embodiment, the antibodies described herein bind CD PDGFR-alpha 20 with a Kd of less than about 500, 400, 300, 200 or 100 picomolar (pM) and inhibit tumor growth. In some embodiments, the antibodies bind PDGFR-alpha with a Kd of less than about 75, 60, 50. 40. 30,25,20, 10,or5pM.<br>
[001591 As will be appreciated, anti-PDGFR-alpha antibodies can be expressed in cell lines other than hybridoma cell lines. Sequences encoding particular antibodies can be used to transform a suitable mammalian host cell. Transfonnation can he by any known method for introducing polynucleotides into a host cell, including, for example packaging the polynucleotide in a virus (or into a viral vector) and transducing a host cell with the virus (or vector) or by transfeclion procedures known in the art, as exemplified by U.S. Patent Nos. 4,399,216, 4,912,040, 4,740,461, and 4,959,455 (which patents arc hereby incorporated herein by reference). The transfonnation procedure used depends upon the host to be transformed. Methods for introducing heterologous polynucleotides into mammalian cells are well known in the art and include dcxtran-mediated transfeclion, calcium phosphate precipitation,    polybrene    mediated    transfection,    protoplast     fusion,    electroporation,<br><br><br>

|00164| Antibodies, as described herein in the Examples, were prepared through the utilization of the XenoMouse® technology, as described below. Such mice, then, are capable of producing human immunoglobulin molecules and antibodies and are deficient in the production of murine immunoglobulin molecules and antibodies. Technologies utilized for achieving the same are disclosed in the patents: applications, and references disclosed in the background section herein. In particular, however, a preferred embodiment of transgenic production of mice and antibodies therefrom is disclosed in U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 08/759,620, filed December 3, 1996 and International Patent Application Nos. WO 98/24893, published June 11, 1998 and WO 00/76310, published December 21, 2000, the disclosures of which are hereby incorporated by reference See also Mendez et a!. Nature Genetics 15:3 46-156 (1997), the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
|00I65J Through the use of such technology, fully human monoclonal antibodies to a variety of antigens have been produced. Essentially^ XenoMouse® lines of mice are immunized with an antigen of interest (e.g. PDGFR-alpha), lymphatic cells (such as B-cells) are recovered from the hyper-immunized mice, and the recovered lymphocytes are fused with a myeloid-type cell line to prepare immortal hybridoma cell lines.   These hybridoma<br><br>
WO 2008/112003<br><br>
PCT/US2007/075117<br><br>
cell lines are screened and selected to identify hybridoma eel! lines that produced antibodies specific to the antigen of interest. Provided herein are methods for the production of multiple hybridoma cell lines that produce antibodies specific to PDGFR-alpha. Further, provided herein are characterization of the antibodies produced by such cell lines, including nucleotide and amino acid sequence analyses of the heavy and light chains of such antibodies.<br>
[00166] Alternatively, instead of being fused to myeloma cells to generate hybridomas, B cells can be directly assayed. For example, CD19+ B cells can be isolated from hyperimmune XenoMouse© mice and allowed to proliferate and differentiate into antibody-secreting plasma cells. Antibodies from the cell supematants are then screened by ELISA for reactivity against the PDGFR-alpha immunogen. The supematants might also be screened for immunoreactivity against fragments of PDGFR-alpha to further map the different antibodies for binding to domains of functional interest on PDGFR-alpha. The antibodies may also be screened other related human receptors and against the rat, the mouse, and non-human primate, such as Cynomolgus monkey, orthologues of PDGFR-alpha, the last to determine species cross-reactivity. B cells from wells containing antibodies of interest may be immortalized by various methods including fusion to make hybridomas either from individual or from pooled wells, or by infection with EBV or transfection by known immortalizing genes and then plating in suitable medium. Alternatively, single plasma cells secreting antibodies with the desired specificities are then isolated using a PDGFR-alpha-specific hemolytic plaque assay (see for example Babcook et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 93:7843-48 (1996)). Cells targeted for lysis are preferably sheep red blood cells (SRBCs) coated with the PDGFR-alpha antigen.<br>
[00167J 'n {he presence of a B-cell culture containing plasma cells secreting the immunoglobulin of interest and complement, the formation of a plaque indicates specific PDGFR-alpha-mediated lysis of the sheep red blood cells surrounding the plasma cell of interest. The single antigen-specific plasma cell in the center of the plaque can be isolated and the genetic information that encodes the specificity of the antibody is isolated from the single plasma cell. Using reverse-transcription followed by PCR (RT-PCR), the DNA encoding the heavy and light chain variable regions of the antibody can be cloned. Such cloned DNA can then be further inserted into a suitable expression vector, preferably a vector cassette such as a pcDNA, more preferably such a pcDNA vector containing the constant<br><br><br>
WO2008/U20U3<br><br>
PCT/US2007/075117<br><br>
domains of immunoglobulin heavy and light chain. The generated vector can then be transfected into host cells, e.g., HEK293 cells, CHO cells, and cultured in conventional nutrient media modified as appropriate for inducing transcription, selecting transformants. or amplifying the genes encoding the desired sequences.<br>
(00168) Anti-PDGFR-alpha antibodies can have therapeutic effects in treating symptoms and conditions related to PDGFR-alpha expression. For example, the antibodies can inhibit growth of cells expressing PDGFR-alpha, thereby inhibiting tumor growth, or the antibodies can be associated with an agent and deliver a lethal toxin to a targeted cell. Anti-PDGFR-alpha antibodies can have therapeutic effects in treating fibrotic diseases, such as cardiac, lung, liver, kidney or skin fibrosis. Anti-PDGFR-alpha antibodies can also have therapeutic effects in the treatment of allograft vasculopathy or restenosis. In addition, the anti-PDGFR-alpha antibodies are useful as diagnostics for the disease states, especially neoplastic, fibrotic and immune system diseases.<br>
|001691 If desired, the isotype of an anti-PDGFR-alpha antibody can be switched, for example to take advantage of a biological property of a different isotype. For example, in some circumstances it can be desirable in connection with the generation of antibodies as therapeutic antibodies against PDGFR-alpha that the antibodies be capable of fixing complement and participating in complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC). There are a number of isotypes of antibodies that are capable of the same, including, without limitation, the following: murine lgM, murine IgG2a, murine lgG2b, murine lgG3, human IgM, human JgA, human IgGl, and human lgG3. In other embodiments it can be desirable in connection with the generation of antibodies as therapeutic antibodies against PDGFR-alpha that the antibodies be capable of binding Fc receptors on effector cells and participating in antibody-dependent cytotoxicity (ADCC). There are a number of isotypes of antibodies that are capable of the same, including, without limitation, the following: murine lgG2a, murine IgG2b, murine IgG3, human IgGl, and human lgG3. It will be appreciated that antibodies that are generated need not initially possess such an isotype but, ratlier, the antibody as generated can possess any isotype and the antibody can be isotype switched thereafter using conventional techniques that are well known in the art. Such techniques include the use of direct recombinant techniques (see e.g., U.S. Patent No. 4,816,397), cell-cell fusion techniques (see e.g., U.S. Patent Nos. 5,916,771 and 6,207,418), among others.<br><br><br><br>
WO 2008/112003<br><br>
PCT/US20UTWI7SH*<br><br>
[00170} By way of example, the anti-PDGFR-alpha antibodies discussed herein are fully human antibodies. If an antibody possessed desired binding to PDGFR-alpha, it could be readily isolype switched to generate a human lgM, human JgGl, or human IgG3 isotype, while still possessing the same variable region (which defines the antibody's specificity and some of its affinity). Such molecule would then be capable of fixing complement and participating in CDC and/or be capable of binding to Fc receptors on effector cells and participating in ADCC.<br>
[00171] In the cell-cell fusion technique, a myeloma, CHO cell or other cell line is prepared that possesses a heavy chain with any desired isotype and another myeloma, CHO cell or other cell line is prepared that possesses the light chain. Such cells can, thereafter, be fused and a cell line expressing an intact antibody can be isolated.<br>
[00172] Accordingly, as antibody candidates are generated thai meet desired ■'structural1' attributes as discussed above, they can generally be provided with at least certain of the desired "functional" attributes through isotype switching.<br>
Therapeutic Administration and Formulations<br>
[00173j Embodiments of the invention include sterile pharmaceutical formulations of anti-PDGFR-alpha antibodies that are useful as treatments for diseases. Such formulations would inhibit cell growth, thereby effectively treating pathological conditions where, for example, PDGFR-alpha expression is abnormally elevated or PDGFR-alpha expressing cells mediate disease states. Anti-PDGFR-alpha antibodies preferably possess adequate affinity to specifically bind PDGFR-alpha, and preferably have an adequate duration of action to allow for infrequent dosing in humans. A prolonged duration of action will allow for less frequent and more convenient dosing schedules by alternate parenteral routes such as subcutaneous or intramuscular injection.<br>
[00174J Sterile formulations can be created, for example, by filtration through sterile filtration membranes, prior to or following lyophilization and reconstitution of the antibody. The antibody ordinarily will be stored in lyophilized form or in solution. Therapeutic antibody compositions generally are placed into a container having a sterile access port, for example, an intravenous solution bag or vial having an adapter that allows retrieval of the formulation, such as a stopper pierceable by &amp; hypodermic injection needle.<br><br><br>
WO 2008/H2003<br><br>
PCT/US2Q07/075U7<br><br>
J00175] The route of antibody administration is in accord with known methods, e.g., injection or infusion by intravenous, intraperitoneal, intracerebral, intramuscular, intraocular, intraarterial, intrathecal, inhalation or intralesional routes, or by sustained release systems as noted below. The antibody is preferably administered continuously by infusion or by bolus injection.<br>
|00176] An effective amount of antibody to be employed therapeutically will depend, for example, upon the therapeutic objectives, the route of administration, and the condition of the patient. Accordingly, it is preferred that the therapist titer the dosage and modify the route of administration as required to obtain the optimal therapeutic effect. Typically, the clinician will administer antibody until a dosage is reached that achieves the desired effect. The progress of this therapy is easily monitored by conventional assays or by the assays described herein.<br>
[001771 Antibodies, as described herein, can be prepared in a mixture with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. This therapeutic composition can be administered intravenously or through the nose or lung, preferably as a liquid or powder aerosol (lyophilized). The composition can also be administered parenterally or subcutaneously as desired. When administered systemically, the therapeutic composition should be sterile, pyrogen-free and in a parenterally acceptable solution having due regard for pH, isotonieity, and stability. These conditions are known to those skilled in the art. Briefly, dosage formulations of the compounds described herein are prepared for storage or administration by mixing the compound having the desired degree of purity with physiologically acceptable carriers, excipienls, or stabilizers. Such materials are non-toxic to the recipients at the dosages and concentrations employed, and include buffers such as TR1S HC1, phosphate, citrate, acetate and other organic acid salts; antioxidants such as ascorbic acid; low molecular weight (less than about ten residues) peptides such as polyarginine, proteins, such as serum albumin, gelatin, or immunoglobulins; hydrophilic polymers such as polyvinylpyrrolidinone; amino acids such as glycine, glutamic acid, aspartic acid, or arginine; monosaccharides, disaccharides, and other carbohydrates including cellulose or its derivatives, glucose, mannose, or dextrins; chelating agents such as EDTA: sugar alcohols such as mannitol or sorbitol; counterions such as sodium and/or nonionic surfactants such as TWEEN. PLURONiCS orpolyethyleneglycol.<br><br><br>
WO 2008/112003<br><br>
PCT/US2007/073H7<br><br>
(00178) Sterile compositions for injection can be formulated according to conventional pharmaceutical practice as described in Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy (20th ed, Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkens Publishers (2003)). For example, dissolution or suspension of the active compound in a vehicle such as water or naturally occurring vegetable oil like sesame, peanut, or cottonseed oil or a synthetic fatty vehicle like ethyl oleate or the like can be desired. Buffers, preservatives, antioxidants and the like can be incorporated according to accepted pharmaceutical practice.<br>
[00179] Suitable examples of sustained-release preparations include semipermeable matrices of solid hydrophobic polymers containing the polypeptide, which matrices are in the form of shaped articles, films or microcapsules. Examples of sustained-release matrices include polyesters, hydrogels (e.g., poly(2-hydroxyethyl-mctbacrylate) as described by Langer et al., J. Biomed Mater. Res.. (1981) 15:167-277 and Langer. Chem. Tech., (1982) 12:98-105, or poly(vinylalcohol)), polylaclides (U.S. Pat. No. 3,773,919, EP 58,481), copolymers of L-glutamic acid and gamma ethyl-L-glutamate (Sidman et al., Biopolymers, (1983) 22:547-556), non-degradable ethylene-vinyl acetate (Langer et al., supra), degradable lactic acid-glycolic acid copolymers such as the LUPRON Depot™ (injectable microspheres composed of lactic acid-glycolic acid copolymer and leuprolide acetate), and poly-D-(-)-3-hydroxybutyric acid (EP 133,988).<br>
100180) While polymers such as ethylene-vinyl acetate and lactic acid-glycolic acid enable release of molecules for over 100 days, certain hydrogels release proteins lor shorter time periods. When encapsulated proteins remain in the body for a long time, they can denature or aggregate as a result of exposure to moisture at 37°C? resulting in a loss of biological activity and possible changes in immunogenicity. Rational strategies can be devised for protein stabilization depending on the mechanism involved. For example, if the aggregation mechanism is discovered to be inlermolecular S-S bond formation through disulfide interchange, stabilization can be achieved by modifying sulfhydryl residues., lyophilizing from acidic solutions, controlling moisture content, using appropriate additives, and developing specific polymer matrix compositions.<br>
J00181] Sustained-released compositions also include preparations of crystals of the antibody suspended in suitable formulations capable of maintaining crystals in suspension.     These preparations when injected  subcutaneously or intraperitonealy can<br><br><br>
WO 2008/112003<br><br>
PCT/US2007/075117<br><br>
produce a sustained release effect. Other compositions also include liposomaliy entrapped antibodies. Liposomes containing such antibodies are prepared by methods known per se: U.S. Pat. No. DE 3,218,121; Epstein et a], Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. (1985) S2:36S8-3692; Hwang et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, (1980) 77:4030-4034; EP 52,322: EP 36,676; EP 88,046; EP 143,949; 142,641; Japanese patent application 83-118008; U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,485,045 and 4,544,545; and EP 102,324.<br>
|00182J The dosage of the antibody formulation for a given patient will be determined by the attending physician taking into consideration various factors known to modify the action of drugs including severity and type of disease, body weight, sex, diet, time and route of administration, other medications and other relevant clinical factors. Therapeutically effective dosages can be determined by either in vitro or in vivo methods.<br>
f001831 An effective amount of the antibodies, described herein, to be employed therapeutically will depend, for example, upon the therapeutic objectives, the rouie of administration, and the condition of the patient. Accordingly, it is preferred for the therapist to titer the dosage and modify the route of administration as required to obtain the optimal therapeutic effect. A typical daily dosage might range from about O.OOlmg/kg to up to lOOmg/kg or more, depending on the factors mentioned above. Typically, the clinician will administer the therapeutic antibody until a dosage is reached that achieves the desired effect. The progress of this therapy is easily monitored by conventional assays or as described herein.<br>
(00184| It will be appreciated that administration of therapeutic entities in accordance with the compositions and methods herein will be administered with suitable cairiers, excipicnis, and other agents that are incorporated into formulations to provide improved transfer, delivery, tolerance, and the like. These formulations include, for example, powders, pastes, ointments, jellies, waxes, oils, lipids, lipid (cationic or anionic) containing vesicles (such as LipofectinTM), DNA conjugates, anhydrous absorption pastes, oil-in-water and water-in-oil emulsions, emulsions carbowax (polyethylene glycols of various molecular weights), semi-solid gels, and semi-solid mixtures containing carbowax. Any of the foregoing mixtures can be appropriate in treatments and therapies in accordance with the present invention, provided that the active ingredient in the formulation is not inactivated by the formulation and the formulation is physiologically compatible and tolerable with the<br><br><br>

[001851 In accordance with the present invention and based on the activity of the antibodies that are produced and characterized herein with respect to PDGFR-alpha. the design of other therapeutic modalities is facilitated and disclosed to one of skill in the an. Such modalities include, without limitation, advanced antibody therapeutics, such as bispecific antibodies, immunotoxins, radiolabeled therapeutics, and single antibody V domains, antibody-like binding agent based on other than V region scaffolds, generation of peptide therapeutics, gene therapies, particularly intrabodies. antisense therapeutics, and small molecules.<br>
(00186) An antigen binding site may be provided by means of arrangement of CDR.S on non-antibody protein scaffolds, such as fibronectin or cytochrome B etc. (Haan &amp; Maggos (2004) BioCentury, 12(5): A1-A6; Koideel al. (1998) Journal of Molecular Biology, 284: 1141-1151; Nygren et al. (1997) Current Opinion in Structural Biology, 7: 463-469) or by randomising Or mutating amino acid residues of a Joop vyjthm a protein scaffoJd to confer binding specificity for a desired target. Scaffolds for engineering novel binding sites in proteins have been reviewed in detail by Nygren et al. (Nygren et al. (1997) Current Opinion in Structural Biology, 7: 463-469). Protein scaffolds for antibody mimics are disclosed in WO/0034784, which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety, in which the inventors describe proteins (antibody mimics) that include a fibronectin type III domain having at least one randomised loop. A suitable scaffold into which to graft one or more CDRs, e.g. a set of HCDRs, may be provided by any domain member of the immunoglobulin gene superfamily.  The scaffold may be a human or non-human protein.  An advantage of a<br><br><br>
WO 2008/112003<br><br>
PCT/US2007/075117<br><br>
non-antibody protein scaffold is that it may provide an antigen-binding site in a scaffold molecule that is smaller and/or easier to manufacture than at least some antibody molecules. Small size of a binding member may confer useful physiological properties, such as an ability to enter cells, penetrate deep into tissues or reach targets within other structures, or to bind within protein cavities of the target antigen. Use of antigen binding sites in non-antibody protein scaffolds is reviewed in Wess, 2004 (Wess. L. In: BioCentury, The Bernstein Report on BioBusiness, 12(42), A1-A7, 2004). Typical are proteins having a stable backbone and one or more variable loops, in which the amino acid sequence of the loop or loops is specifically or randomly mutated to create an antigen-binding site that binds the target antigen. Such proteins include the IgG-binding domains of protein A from S. aureus, transferrin, albumin, tetranectin, fibronectin (e.g. 10th fibronectin type III domain), lipocalins as well as gamma-crystalline and other Affilin™ scaffolds (Sal Proteins). Examples of other approaches include synthetic "Microbodies" based on cyclotides - small proteins having intra-molecular disulphide bonds. Microproteins (Versabodies™, Amunix) ?nd ankyrin repeat proteins (DARPins, Molecular Partners).<br>
|00187] In addition to antibody sequences and/or an antigen-binding site, a targeted binding agent according to the present invention may comprise other amino acids, e.g. forming a peptide or polypeptide, such as a folded domain, or to impart to the molecule another functional characteristic in addition to ability to bind antigen. Targeted binding agent s of the invention may carry a detectable label, or may be conjugated to a toxin or a targeting moiety or enzyme (e.g. via a peptidyl bond or linker). For example, a targeted binding agent may comprise a catalytic site (e.g. in an enzyme domain) as well as an antigen binding site, wherein the antigen binding site binds to the antigen and thus targets the catalytic site to the antigen. The catalytic site may inhibit biological function of the antigen, e.g. by cleavage.<br>
1.00188) 'n connection with the generation of advanced antibody therapeutics, where complement fixation is a desirable attribute, it can be possible to sidestep the dependence on complement for cell killing through the use of bispecifics. immunotoxins, or radiolabels, for example.<br>
(00189] For example, bispeciftc antibodies can be generated that comprise (i) two antibodies, one with a specificity to PDGFR-alpha and another to a second molecule, that are<br><br><br>
WO 2008/112003<br><br>
PCT/US2007/075117<br><br>
conjugated together, (ii) a single antibody that has one chain specific to PDGFR-alpha and a second chain specific to a second molecule, or (iii) a single chain antibody that has specificity to both PDGFR-alpha and the other molecule. Such bispecific antibodies can be generated using techniques that are well known; for example, in connection with (i) and (ii) see e.g., Fanger el al. Immunol Methods 4:72-81 (1994) and Wright and Hams, supra, and in connection with (iii) see e.g., Traunecker et al. Int. J. Cancer (Suppl.) 7:51-52 (1992). In each case, the second specificity can be made as desired. For example, the second specificity can be made to the heavy chain activation receptors, including, without limitation, CD 16 or CD64 (see e.g., Deo et al. 18:127 (1997)) or CD89 (see e.g., Valerius et al. Blood 90:4485-4492(1997)).<br>
(00190] Antibodies can also be modified to act as immunotoxins utilizing techniques that are well known in the an. See e.g., Vitetta Immunol Today 14:252 (1993). See also U.S. Patent No. 5,194,594. In connection with the preparation of radiolabeled antibodies, such modified antibodies can also be readily prepared utilizing techniques that are well known in the art. See e.g., Junghans et al. in Cancer Chemotherapy and Biotherapy 655-686 (2d edition, Chafher and Longo, eds., Lippincott Raven (1996)). See also U.S. Patent Nos. 4,681,581, 4,735,210, 5,101,827, 5,102,990 (RE 35,500), 5,648,471, and 5,697,902. Each of immunotoxins and radiolabeled molecules would be likely to kill cells expressing the desired multimeric enzyme.._subunit oligomenzation domain. In some embodiments, a pharmaceutical composition comprising an effective amount of the antibody in association with a pharrnaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent is provided.<br>
|00191j m some embodiments, an anti-PDGFR-alpha antibody is linked to an agent (e.g., radioisotope, pharmaceutical composition, or a toxin). Preferably, such antibodies can be used for the treatment of diseases, such diseases can relate cells expressing PDGFR-alpha or cells overexpressing PDGFR-alpha. For example, it is contemplated that the drug possesses the pharmaceutical property selected from the group of antimitotic, alkylating, antimetabolite, antiangiogenic, apoptotic, alkaloid, COX-2. and antibiotic agents and combinations thereof. The drug can be selected from the group of nitrogen mustards, ethylenimine derivatives, alkyl sulfonates, nitrosoureas, triazenes, folic acid analogs, anthracyc lines, taxanes, COX-2 inhibitors, pyrimidine analogs, purine analogs, antimetabolites,    antibiotics,     enzymes,    epipodophyllotoxins,    platinum     coordination<br><br><br>

complexes, vinca alkaloids, substituted ureas, methyl hydrazine derivatives, adrenocortical suppressants, antagonists, endostatin, taxols. camptothecins, oxaliplalin, doxorubicins and their analogs, and a combination thereof.<br>
[00192] Examples of toxins further include gelonin, Pseudomonas exotoxin (PE). PE40, PE38, diphtheria toxin, ricin, ricin, abrin, alpha toxin, saporin, ribonuclease (RNase): DNase I, Staphylococcal enterotoxin-A, pokeweed antiviral protein, gelonin, Pseudomonas endotoxin, as well as derivatives, combinations and modifications thereof.<br>
[00193] Examples of radioisotopes include gamma-emitters, positron-emiIters, and x-ray emitters that can be used for localization and/or therapy, and beta-emitters and alpha-emitters that can be used for therapy. The radioisotopes described previously as useful for diagnostics, prognostics and staging are also useful for therapeutics. Non-limiting examples of anti-cancer or anti-leukemia agents include anthracyclines such as doxorubicin (adriamycin), daunorubicin (daunomycin), idarubicin, detorubicin, carminomycin, cpirubicin, esorubicin, and morpholino and substituted derivatives, combinations and modifications thereof. Exemplary pharmaceutical agents include cis-platinum, taxol, calicheamicin, vincristine, cytarabine (Ara-C), cyclophosphamide, prednisone, daunorubicin, idarubicin. fludarabine, chlorambucil, interferon alpha, hydroxyurea, temozolomide, thalidomide, and bleomycin, and derivatives, combinations and modifications thereof. Preferably, the anti¬cancer or anti-leukemia is doxorubicin, morpholinodoxorubicin, or morpholinodaunorubicin.<br>
[00194] The antibodies of the invention also encompass antibodies that have half-lives (e.g., serum half-lives) in a mammal, preferably a human, of greater than that oi" an unmodified antibody. In one embodiment, said antibody half life is greater than about 15 days, greater than about 20 days, greater than about 25 days, greater than about 30 days, greater than about 35 days, greater than about 40 days, greater than about 45 days, greater than about 2 months, greater than about 3 months, greater than about 4 months, or greater than about 5 months. The increased half-lives of the antibodies of the present invention or fragments thereof in a mammal, preferably a human, result in a higher serum titer of said antibodies or antibody fragments in the mammal, and thus, reduce the frequency of the administration of said antibodies or antibody fragments and/or reduces the concentration of said antibodies or antibody fragments to be administered. Antibodies or fragments thereof having increased in vivo half-lives can be generated by techniques known to those of skill in<br><br>
WO 2008/112003<br><br>
PCT/US2007/075117<br><br>
the art. For example, antibodies or fragments thereof with increased in vivo half-lives can be generated by modifying (e.g., substituting, deleting or addisjg) amino acid residues identified as involved in the interaction between the Fc domain and the FcRn receptor (see. e.g.. International Publication Nos. WO 97/34631 and WO 02/060919, which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties). Antibodies or fragments thereof with increased in vivo half-lives can be generated by attaching to said antibodies or antibody fragments polymer molecules such as high molecular weight poiyethyleneglycol (PEG). PEG can be attached to said antibodies or antibody fragments with or without a multifunctional linker either through site-specific conjugation of the PEG to the N- or C-terminus of said antibodies or antibody fragments or via epsilon-amino groups present on lysine residues. Linear or branched polymer derivatization that results in minimal loss of biological activity will be used. The degree of conjugation will be closely monitored by SDS-PAGE and mass spectrometry to ensure proper conjugation of PEG molecules to the antibodies. Unreacted PEG can be separated from antibody-PEG conjugates by, e.g., size exclusion or ion-exchange chromatography.<br>
|00195| As will be appreciated by one of skill in the art, in the above embodiments, while affinity values can be important, other factors can be as important or more so, depending upon the particular function of the antibody. For example, for an immunotoxin (toxin associated with an antibody), the act of binding of the antibody lo the target can be useful; however, in some embodiments, it is the internalization of the toxin imo the cell that is the desired end result. As such, antibodies with a high percent internalization can be desirable in these situations. Thus, in one embodiment, antibodies with a high efficiency in internalization are contemplated. A high efficiency of internalization can be measured as a percent internalized antibody, and can be from a low value to 100%. For example, in varying embodiments, 0.1-5, 5-10, 10-20, 20-30, 30-40, 40-45, 45-50, 50-60, 60-70, 70-80, 80-90, 90-99, and 99-100% can be a high efficiency. As will be appreciated by one of skill in the art, the desirable efficiency can be different in different embodiments, depending upon, for example, the associated agent, the amount of antibody that can be administered to an area, the side effects of the antibody-agent complex, the type (e.g., cancer type) and severity of the problem to be treated.<br><br><br>

RECOVERY OF LYMPHOCYTES, B-CELL ISOLATIONS, FUSIONS AND GENERATION OF HYBRIDOMAS<br>
[00205} Immunized mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation and the draining lymph nodes were harvested and pooled from each cohoit. The lymphoid cells were dissociated by grinding in DMEM to release the cells from the tissues, and the colls were suspended in DMEM. The ceils were counted, and 0.9 ml DMEM per 100 million lymphocytes was added to the ceil pellet to resuspend the cells gently but completely. Using 100 u:l of CD90+ magnetic beads per 100 million cells, the cells were labeled by incubating the cells with the magnetic beads at 4°C for 15 minutes. The magnetically-labeled cell suspension containing up to 108 positive cells (or up to 2x109 total cells) was loaded onto an LS+ column and the column washed with DMEM. The total effluent was collected as the CD90-negative fraction (most of these cells were expected to be B cells).<br>
[00206] A fusion was performed by mixing washed enriched B cells from above and nonsecretory myeloma P3X63Ag8.653 cells purchased from ATCC (cat. no. CRL 1580) (Kearney et al, J. Immunol. 123, 1979, 1548-1550) at a ratio of 1:1. The cell mixture was gently pelleted by centrifugation at 800 x g. After complete removal of the supernatant, the cells were treated with 2-4 mL of Pronase solution (CalBiochem, cat. # 53702; 0.5 mg/mL in PBS) for no more than 2 minutes. Then 3-5 ml of FBS was added to stop the enzyme activity and the suspension was adjusted to 40 mL total volume using electro cell fusion solution, ECFS (0.3 M Sucrose, Sigma, Cat# S7903, 0.1 mM Magnesium Acetate, Sigma, Cat# M2545, 0.1 mM Calcium Acetate, Sigma, Cat# C4705). The supernatant was removed after centrifugation and the cells were resuspended in 40 mL ECFS. This wash step was repeated and the cells again were resuspended in ECFS to a concentration of 2x106 cells/mL.<br><br><br>

The cells were incubated for 15-30 minutes at 37°C, and then centrifuged at 400 x g (1000 rpm) for five minutes. The cells were gently resuspended in a small volume of Hybridoma Selection Medium (Hybridoma Culture Medium supplemented with 0.5x HA (Sigma, cat. # A9666)), and the volume was adjusted appropriately wilh more Hybridoma Selection Medium, based on a final plating of 5x106 B cells total per 96-well plate and 200 JIL per well. The cells were mixed gently and pipetted into 96-well plates and allowed to grow. On day 7 or 10, one-half the medium was removed, and the cells were re-fed with Hybridoma Selection Medium.<br>
ELISA screening<br>
|00209] For ELISA analysis, recombinant human PDGFR-alpha (R&amp;D systems, cat#322-PR7CF ), at a concentration of 4ug/ml, was used as a capture reagent. ELISA plates were coated with recombinant human PDGFR-alpha in a volume of 50 (il/well in antigen coating buffer (0.1 M Carbonate Buffer, pH 9.6 NaHC03 (MW 84) 8.4 g/L) and incubated overnight at 4°C.

EXAMPLE 3 SELECTION OF CANDIDATE ANTIBODIES BY FMAT AND FACS<br>
[002101 After 14 days of culture, hybridoma supematants were screened for PDGFR-alpha-specific monoclonal antibodies by Fluorometric Microvolume Assay Technology (FMAT) by screening against either the human osteosarcoma MG-63 cell line or recombinant HEK293 cells that were transfected with human PDGFR-alpha and counter-screening against parental HEK293 cells.<br>
[002111 The culture supematants from the positive hybridoma cells growth wells based on the primary screen were removed and the PDGFR-alpha positive hybridoma cells were suspended with fresh hybridoma culture medium and were transferred to 24-well plates. After two days in culture, these supematants were ready for a secondary confirmation screen. In the secondary confirmation screen, the positives in the first screening were screened by FACS with two sets or three sets of detection antibodies used separately: 1.25ug/ml GAH-Gamma Cy5 (JIR# 109-176-098) for human gamma chain detection: 1.25ug/ml GAH-Kappa PE (S.B.#2063-09) for human kappa light chain detection and ].25ug/ml GAH-lambda PE (S.B.#2073-09) for human lambda light chain detection in order to confirm that the anli-PDGFR-alpha antibodies were fully human.<br>

Plates were incubated for 10 minutes at 37°C. Media was removed and 100 ul of 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS/3%BSA was added and incubated for 20 minutes at room temperature. Plates were washed two times with PBS and 100 ul permeabilization buffer (0.1% Triton-X in 3%BSA/PBS) was added to each well, incubated at room temperature for 10 minutes, and discarded. 100 ml of 0.6% hydrogen peroxide in PBS/3% BSA was added to inactivate any endogenous peroxidase activity and incubated at room temperature for 20 minutes. Plates were washed three times with PBS/0.1% Tween-20 and blocked with 100 u! 10% FBS in PBS/0.1% Tween-20. Plates were incubated for 1 hour ai room temperature, blocking buffer removed, and 50 ul anti-phospho PDGFa antibody (sc-12910-R) (1 ug/ml) was added to each well in 10% FBS/PBS-T. Plates were incubated for 2 hours at room temperature, then washed three times with PBST, soaking for 5 minutes between each wash. 50 ul of Goat anti-Rabbit IgGFc-HRP secondary antibody diluted in Blocking Buffer was added and incubated at room temperature for 1 hour.

High Antigen Quantitation Assay<br>
[00216] Briefly, EL1SA plates were coated with a greater amount of human PDGFR-alpha antigen (R&amp;D Systems, Inc., Minneapolis, MN Cat. No. 322-PR-050/CF) in comparison with the Limited Antigen Quantitation Assay described below. Antibody-containing hybridoma supematants were titrated over a dilution range of 1:51 to 1:1656. A control of a known mouse anti-human PDGFR-alpha-specific antibody (PharMingen Catalog No. 556001) was used to define the linear range of the assay. Data within the linear range were then used to derive the relative concentration of the PDGFR-specific antibody in each titrated sample.<br>
Limited Antigen Quantitation Assay<br>
100217] Microliter plates were coated with a lower amount of human PDGFR-alpha antigen in comparison with the High Antigen Quantitation Assay described above. Fifty microliters (50 uX) of human PDGFR-alpha at 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, and 2 ng/ml (covering a range of 8.5 nM to 0.26 nM) in 1% skim milk / IX PBS pH 7.4 / 0.5% azidc was added to each well. The plate was incubated for 30 minutes.<br>
(00218J Plates were washed four limes with water, and 50uL of hybridoma supernatant containing test antibodies diluted 1:25 in 1% skim milk / IX PBS pH 7.4 / 0.5% azide were added to the wells. Plates were wrapped tightly with plastic wrap or paraffin film, and incubated overnight with shaking at room temperature.<br>
[002191 O" me following day, ali plates were washed five times and 50 uL goat anti-Human IgG Fc HRP polyclonal antibody at a concentration of 0.5 ug/ml in 1% milk, IX PBS pH 7.4 was added to each well. The plates were incubated for \ hour at room temperature.<br>
[00220| Plates were washed at least five times with tap water. Fifty microliters (50) uL of HPR substrate TMB was added to each well, and the plate were incubated for 30 minutes. The HRP-TMB reaction was stopped by adding 50 uL of 1M phosphoric acid to each well. Optical density (absorbance) at 450 ran was measured for each well of the plate.<br><br>

(00221] Thirty-four (34) antibody lines were selected based on relative binding affinity. Selection was based on titration of antigen at 16 ng/ml and 2 ng/ml. Selected cut¬offs were LA greater than 0.3 OD units and 3.3 ug/ml. Lines thai exhibited weak reactivity at antigen concentration of 2 ng/ml of antigen were de-selected.<br>
(00222] Nine (9) additional lines were added to increase the candidate pool based on inhibition of PDGFR-alpha phosphorylation in MG-63 cells, such that a total of 43 antibody lines that exhibited potent inhibition of tyrosine phosphorylation and high relative affinity based on HA/LA analysis were carried forward. The aforementioned nine additional lines exhibited complete inhibition of PDGFR-alpha phosphorylation (i.e 100%). None of the lines cross-reacted with PDGFR-beta or homologs (FLT3, c-kit, CSF-1R).<br>

Cells were washed with PBS IX with media and replaced with growth starvation culture media (MEM, 1% NEAA, 0.1% NaBicarb, 1% L glut) and stai-ved overnight. Media was removed from plates and 50 ui of 2X mAb or media added lo appropriate wells. 50 ul of PDGF-AA titration, 200 ng/ml PDGF-AA or media alone was added and plates incubated for 3 days. Plates were read out with Alamar Blue at 530 excitation and 580 nm emission (100 ul per well/100 ul).<br>
|00227| Data for the lop 15 monoclonal antibodies, i.e. exhibiting the lowest 1C50 values, for a cell stimulation using 100 ng/ml (3.45 nM) PDGF-AA are summarized below in Table 3. Monoclonal antibodies selected for further analysis are shown in bold. The dose response curves for 5 of the selected antibodies are shown in Figure 1. The preparation of 2.451.1.1 may contain two different antibodies, with the same heavy chain but different light chains, since there were two different light chain sequences detected during sequencing of the DNA for this monoclonal antibody.<br>

EXAMPLE 7 STRUCTURAL ANALYSIS OF ANTI-PDGFR-ALPHA ANTIBODIES<br>
(00237] The heavy and light chain variable domains of the antibodies were sequenced to detennine their DNA sequences. The complete sequence information for the anti-PDGFR-alpha antibodies is provided in the sequence listing with nucleotide and amino acid sequences for each gamma and kappa chain combination. The variable heavy sequences were analyzed to detennine the VH family, the D-region sequence and the J-region sequence. The sequences were then translated to determine the primary amino acid sequence and compared to the germline VH, D and J-region sequences to assess somatic hypermutations. "-" indicates identity with the germline sequence. ll#:; indicates an additional amino acid in the antibody sequences that is not found in the germline.<br>
(00238[ Tabic 12 is a table comparing the antibody heavy chain regions to their cognate germline heavy chain region. Table 13 is a table comparing the antibody kappa light chain regions to their cognate germline light chain region.<br>
[00239] The variable (V) regions of immunoglobulin chains are encoded by multiple germline DNA segments, which are joined into functional variable regions (VHDJH or VKJK) during B-cell ontogeny.<br>
(00240) It should also be appreciated that where a particular antibody differs from its respective germline sequence at the amino acid level, the antibody sequence can be mutated back to the germline sequence. Such corrective mutations can occur at one, two, three or more positions, or a combination of any of the mutated positions, using standard molecular biological techniques. By way of non-limiting example. Table 12 shows thai the heavy chain sequence of mAb 2.175.3 (SEQ ID NO.: 2) differs from the corresponding germline sequence inter alia through a Q to H mutation (mutation 1) in the FR1 region, a S to H mutation (mutation 2) in die CDRl region, and a S to R mutation (mutation 3) in the CDR2 region. Thus, the amino acid or nucleotide sequence encoding the heavy chain of mAb 2.175.3 can be modified to change mutation 1 to yield the germline sequence at the site of mutation 1. Further, the amino acid or nucleotide sequence encoding the heavy chain of mAb 2.175.3 can be modified to change mutation 2 or mutation 3 to yield the genu line sequence at the site of mutation 2 or mutation 3. Indeed the amino acid or nucleotide sequence encoding the heavy chain of mAb 2.175.3 can encompass any combination of two<br><br><br>

or more mutations lo yield the germline sequence at those particular sites. Tables 6-11 below illustrate the position of such variations from the germline for mAb 2.175.3, 2.449.1.3 and 2.998.2. Each row represents a unique combination of germline and non-gennline residues at the positions indicated. In the event of a discrepancy between the sequence listing and tables 6-1 J, the information provided in the table takes precedence.<br>
