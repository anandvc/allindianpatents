				<td>PROCESS FOR DEWATERING A MINERAL SLURRY CONCENTRATE AND INCREASING THE PRODUCTION OF A FILTER CAKE<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a process and synergistic composition for dewatering an aqueous mineral slurry and increasing the production of a resulting filter cake. In particular, this invention provides such a process and synergistic composition wherein the aqueous mineral slurry is dewatered by mixing it with an effective amount of a nonionic surfactant and with an effective amount of a cationic polymer, and subjecting the above to a filtration process for removing the water and increasing the production of the resulting filter cake.<br>
2, Background Art<br>
Numerous mineral ores are processed to recover the most valuable components. The ores are processed, for example but not limited to, by crushing, sieving, cycloning, washing, floating and thickening to concentrate the most desired components to form a concentrated aqueous mineral slurry. Components of minerals generally are concentrated by these procedures that are well known by those skilled in the art. Such a concentrated mineral slurry is customarily then subject to a dewatering process in order to achieve liquid water removal from the concentrated mineral slurry. As used herein in the present invention, the term "concentrated mineral slurry" may be for example but not limited to concentrates of iron ores, copper ores, combinations thereof, salts, oxides and sulfides thereof, and in particular, magnetite iron ore. Other examples<br>
of a concentrated mineral slurry may contain metals such as molybdenum, nickel, zinc ore, platinum group metals, sand and gravel.   As used herein in the present invention, concentrated mineral slurry does not include hematite iron ore or coal. One of the final recovery steps usually involves some form of solid /liquid separation, i.e. filtration or centrifugation. The residual moisture contained in the concentrated mineral ore product can greatly affect subsequent processing of the product such as for example but not limited to pelletizing or smelting or even transportation costs.<br>
Concentrated mineral slurries have been the subject of dewatering processes for many years. The dewatering process endeavors to achieve liquid water removal from the concentrated mineral slurry. A goal of the dewatering process is to decrease the residual liquid water content of the starting mineral slurry concentrate. Dewatering additives such as flocculants in combination with an anionic surfactant have been added to concentrated mineral slurries to reduce the liquid water content of the treated slurry being subjected to filtration. In theory, dewatering aids should increase production rates as well as decrease the amount of water present in the filtered ore or coa! cake solids.   Because the filtered solids contain less water, the oveiall production is expected to increase. However, in practice this is not always observed. Employing the additives and additive combinations known to those skilled in the art, not only does the moisture of the filtered solids decrease but the production solids decrease as well when compared to the untreated ore slurry. Traditionally, polymers have been used to agglomerate solids and increase the filtration rate, However, polymers tend ta entrain water with the solids and thus cause the moisture content of the ore cake to increase. In many instances, the end use or processing of the coal or metal ore is detrimentally affected by the higher moisture content.<br>
Up to now, an effective process to dewater mineral slurry is viewed as an opportunity to increase solids production by lowering the residual moisture in the product and inferring increased production through better and more rapid filtration. Elimination of the moisture in the filter cake or centrifuge solids increases the amount of mineral or ore solids on a weight percent basis, thereby reducing freight costs required for transport or energy costs for further drying or processing per kilogram of the mineralj coal or ore solids. However, the use of a dewatering aid alone usually results in some production loss of the filter cake when compared to no treatment at all.<br>
Thus, it is known by those skilled in the art that generally when the moisture content of an aqueous mineral slurry concentrate is beneficially reduced by use of certain additives, a disadvantage also occurs in that the production of the resulting filter cake is decreased at the expense of achieving the beneficial dewatering. None of the background art processes have addressed both the need to reduce the residual liquid water content of the concentrated mineral slurry while simultaneously increasing the production of the mineral concentrate filter cake that results from the water removal process such as for example but not limited to a filtration process. The present applicants have developed such a process and synergistic additive combination that advantageously provides for a reduction in the residual liquid water content of the concentrated mineral slurry while also providing for an increased production of the filter cake that results from the water removal process,<br>
U.S. Patent No. 4,207,186 (Wang et al. '186) provides a process for dewatering mineral and coal concentrates comprising mixing an aqueous slurry of a mineral concentrate and an effective amount of a dewatering aid that is a combination of hydrophobia alcohol having an aliphatic radical of eight to eighteen carbon atoms and a nonionic surfactant of the formula R-<br>
wherein x is an integer of 1-15, R is a branched or linear aliphatic radical containing six to twenty-four carbon atoms in the alkyl moiety, and subjecting the treated slurry to filtration. Wang et al '186 states that when a hydrophobic alcohol such as decyl alcohol is combined with a nonionic surfactant, lower moisture contents are obtained with iron ore concentrate than had a dewatering aid not been employed. Wang et a3. '3 86, however, is unconcerned with increasing the production of the resulting filter cake,<br>
U.S. Patent No. 4,210,531 (Wang et al. '531) provides a process for dewatering mineral concentrates which consists essentially of first mixing with an aqueous slurry of a mineral concentrate an effective amount of a polyacrylamide flocculant, and next mixing with the flocculant-treated slurry an effective amount of a combination of an anionic surface active agent composition and a water insoluble organic liquid selected from aliphatic hydrocarbons, aromatic hydrocarbons, aliphatic alcohols, aromatic alcohols, aliphatic halides, aromatic halides, vegetable oils and animal oils, wherein the water-insoluble organic liquid being different from any water-insoluble organic liquid present in the anionic surface active agent composition, and thereafter removing the water as a liquid from the slurry. Wang et al. '531, however, does not address and is unconcerned with reducing the residual liquid water content of the concentrated mineral slurry and increasing the production of the resulting filter cake.<br>
The present applicants have found unexpected results with the process of the instant invention in that the present applicants are able to (1) reduce the moisture (liquid water) content of a concentrated mineral slurry that has been treated with their synergistic combination of a nonionic surfactant and cationic polymer, and subjected to a filtration process, and (2) increase the production of the resulting filter cake. Thus, applicants process and synergistic composition combination provides the added economic benefit of increased filter cake production compared<br>
to the use of known synergistic combinations of additives that solely reduce the liquid water content of the concentrated mineral sJurry. Thus, applicants process and synergistic composition combination fulfills a long-felt but heretofore unmet need in the mineral processing industry.<br>

All of the iron ore tested was magnetite which has a formula of Fe3CU which is different<br>
from hematite, Fe 2O3'. The differences in the molecular compositions of magnetite and<br>
hematite based iron ore give different crystal lattice structures and subsequently different<br>
chemical and physical properties,<br>
The following procedure was followed in the examples set forth in Tables 1 through 5<br>
for performing the magnetite filtration step of the process of this invention as described herein:<br>
EXAMPLE OF ANALYTICAL SOLIDS LIQUID SEPARATION LABORATORY TEST<br>
FILTER LEAF TEST<br>
(a)      A sample of ore concentrate is taken from the solids/liquid separation unit process<br>
feed. In this example we assume it is a vacuum filter. For simplicity we will call it<br>
"Filter Feed" (i.e. the mineral slurry concentrate), A typical sample may be 20-30<br>
gallons in 5 gallon buckets. We deliver the Filter Feed sample buckets to a<br>
laboratory where we have a bench scale Filter Leaf Test device set up. A Filter<br>
Leaf Test is commercially available from Komline-Sanderson (Peapack, New<br>
Jersey, USA).<br>
(b)      The Filter Leaf Test device comprises a vacuum pump, a vacuum flask to remove<br>
filtrate that is pulled thru the filter media, and a "filter leaf which is a flat porous<br><br>
plate over which the filter media is placed and suction is applied thru the filter media by a hose connected to the vacuum pump The filter leaf size surface area is a known value so plant filter productivity can be estimated based on laboratory results.<br>
(c)	The buckets are stirred to uniformity and density is checked (and equalized if<br>
necessary to match the other pails) with a standard Marcy Cup and Density Scale,<br>
commercially available from Legends Inc. (Sparks, NV, USA).<br>
(d)	A sample of 5 liters is drawn from the larger sample buckct(s) and set under a<br>
stirrer to keep the sample uniform.<br>
(e)	When ready to test, or run a filter leaf test, the vacuum on the vacuum pump is set<br>
to plant conditions and turned on. The stirrer in the 5 liter sample is shut off and<br>
the filter leaf is immersed in the 5 liter sample of Filter Feed to a preset depth.<br>
(f)	After a pre-determined time (set to duplicate plant conditions) the filter leaf is<br>
removed from the Filter Feed sample and the stirrer is turned back on,<br>
(g)	The vacuum is left on for, again a pre-determined amount of time to simulate<br>
plant vacuum dry time for the filter cake.<br>
(h)      Once the cake formation and dry times ore completed exactly, the vacuum is turned off and the filter cake is removed from the filter leaf filter media. By getting the wet and oven dried weights (4 hours at 100 degrees Centigrade) of the filter cake produced, one can determine the filter cake % moisture and the dry weight of filter production. Results and treatment(s), if any, are recorded by individual Filter Leaf test.<br>
(i)       Dewatering aid and process aid can be added based on the remaining sample being stirred. The addition is accomplished with the use of syringes and a measured amount based on the volume, density, and specific gravity of the 5 liter sample to achieve an accurate dosage ((pounds per long ton ("#/IT") are typical units in ore slurries), A new Filter Leaf test is run using consistently the same procedure. The differences in cake production and moisture of individual filter leaf tests can then be compared to the untreated sample(s) results to get the relative improvements in filter cake productivity and filter cake moisture (drier being better).   Generally, in the results shown in Tables 1 through 5, the nonionic surfactant (dewatering aid) was added initially to the aqueous mineral slurry concentrate followed by (sequentially) the addition of the cationic polymer (process aid) to the nonionic surfactant treated aqueous mineral slurry concentrate. Applicants have achieved similar results as shown in Tables 1 through 5 when the order of addition is varied, for example but not limited to, when the process aid is initially added to the aqueous mineral slurry concentrate followed by the addition of the dewatering aid, or when the dewatering aid and the process aid are first mixed together and then added as a mixture to the aqueous mineral slurry concentrate   Thus, it will be understood by those persons skilled in the art that the order of and the physical point(s) of the addition(s) of the dewatering aid and the process aid to the untreated aqueous mineral slurry concentrate were not crucial to achieving the synergistic results of the Applicants' invention.<br>
(j)       The cycles can be repeated as often as is required to test many<br>
dosages/combinations of filter aids and process aids. Continuous comparison of untreated results assures testing accuracy.<br>
As set forth in Tables 1 and 4, the Iron Ore Slurry I was obtained from Minnesota Mesabi Iron Ore Range-Mineral Processing Facility, and comprised a mineral iron ore of a magnetite composition. The Iron Ore Slurry III set forth in Tables 2 and 5 was obtained from Michigan Negaunee Iron Ore Range-Mineral Processing Facility 1, and comprised a mineral ore of a magnetite composition.   Iron Ore Slurry II set forth in Table 3 was obtained from Michigan Negaunee Iron Ore Range-Mineral Processing Facility 2, and comprised a mineral iron ore of a magnetite composition.<br>
(Table 1-4 Removed)<br>
The data set forth in Tables 1 thru 5 show that the process of the present invention that employs a nonionic surfactant (dewatering aid) in conjunction with a cationic polymer (process aids) synergistically lowers the residua) water contents of filter cakes and increases the production of solids from 9% to over 50% compared to the use of the nonionic surfactant (dewatering aid) by itself.<br>
Applicants supply the following prophetic examples of the process of this invention using methacrylate versions of cationic polymer PA II or cationic polymer PA III, in conjunction with<br>
dewatering aid DWA A, as set forth above. Applicants believe that % production increase would be from about 110% to about 150 % and that the % moisture would be from about 10 % to 10.5 %.<br>
Figure I shows the moisture versus production that can be achieved using the process and compositions of the instant invention. As shown in Figure 1, the process and compositions of the instant invention (identified by the diamonds and circles on Figure 1} provide synergistic results in increasing the percent production of the filter cake (y-axis of Figure 1) while lowering the percent moisture of the resulting filter cake (x-axis of Figure 1) versus no treatment (identified by the triangle on Figure 1), or with the use of a nonionic surfactant (dewateiing aid DWA A) alone. It is known by those skilled in the art that, generally, adding a cationic polymer alone to a mineral slurry concentrate will increase the percent moisture in the resulting filter cake. Thus, it will be appreciated by those persons skilled in the art that the synergistic results obtained by the present invention go far beyond the results achievable with any of the previously known chemistries..<br>
Whereas particular embodiments of the instant invention have been described for purposes of illustration, it will be evident to those persons skilled in the art that numerous variations and details of the instant invention may be made without departing from the instant invention as defined in the appended claims.<br><br><br><br>
